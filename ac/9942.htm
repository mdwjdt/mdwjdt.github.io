<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9942节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9942.</strong>“要用细麻线的织工织内袍”表从属天之爱的真理发出的属灵国度的至内在事物。这从亚伦的衣服和“细麻”的含义清楚可知：亚伦的衣服一般是指毗邻属天国度的属灵国度（参看<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>节），内袍因是这些衣服当中最里面的，故表示该国度的至内在事物，“亚伦的内袍”表示直接从神性属天层发出的属灵国度中的神性真理（参看<a href="9826.htm">9826</a>节）；“细麻”是指来自一个属天源头的真理（参看<a href="9469.htm">9469</a>节）。论到这内袍，经上说它要用织工来织，织工是指编织工所织的东西；“织工”表示来自属天层之物（<a href="9915.htm">9915</a>节）。在原文，表达“织工”的那个词也表示“编织”。<br />这个内袍是织成的，或用编织工的手工作成的，这一点从出埃及记下面的经文明显看出来：<br />他们拿细麻线、用编织工的手工为亚伦和他的儿子作内袍。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.27.htm">39:27</a>）<br />内袍之所以是织成的，也就是用细麻线织成的，是为了让它可以代表直接从属天层发出之物；相对之下，它类似于属天层的一个延续。事实上，从属天层发出的事物类似从人心智的意愿发出之物；因为属于一个人的理解力的一切事物都是从他的意愿发出的。相对于那些由外在从意愿发出的事物，那些由内在从意愿发出的事物可以说是从它那里延续来的。因此，那些由内在从意愿发出的事物主要有对真理的情感；因为存在于理解力里面属于爱的一切情感都是从此人的意愿流入的。天堂也有类似情形，在那里，属天国度对应于人的意愿，属灵国度对应于他的理解力（参看<a href="9835.htm">9835</a>节）。由于亚伦的衣服代表毗邻主的属天国度的其属灵国度（<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>节），所以内袍代表那里的至内在之物，因而代表从属天国度发出，离该国度最近之物；因为内袍是最里面的衣服。由此明显可知为何内袍是织成的，或用织工作的，又为何由细麻线来作。因为“织物”表示来源于意愿或属天层之物（<a href="9915.htm">9915</a>节），“细麻”表示源于属天之爱的真理（<a href="9469.htm">9469</a>节）。<br />圣言其它地方的“内袍”（tunic，或译内衣，里衣、上衣、衣服等）也表示从属天之物发出的属灵之物，如那人和他妻子吃了知识树之后，经上说耶和华为他们作“皮衣”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.20.htm">3:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.21.htm">21</a>）。没有人知道这些“内袍”表示来自一个属天源头的真理，除非这个故事细节的内义被揭开；所以有必要解释一下。那里的“那人和他的妻子”表示属天教会，作为丈夫的那人自己表示良善方面的属天教会，他的妻子表示真理方面的属天教会；这真理和这良善是属天教会的真理和良善。但当该教会堕落时，这种堕落通过基于记忆知识推理神之真理而发生，在内义上由蛇的劝诱来表示，属天教会堕落后的这第一个状态就是此处所描述的，它的真理由“皮衣”来描述。<br />要知道，在创世记第一章，天地的创造在内义上表示并描述了那时教会成员的新造或重生，因而属天教会的建立；“园子”表示并描述了那个教会的智慧和聪明，吃知识树表示并描述了由于基于记忆知识推理神性事物所导致的它的堕落。意思就是这样，这一点从对这些章节的解释中关于这个主题的说明可以看出来。因为创世记头几章所包含的一切事物都是虚构的历史，就其内义而言，是关于属天教会成员的新造或重生的神性事物，如前所述。这种写作方式在上古时代是惯常的，不仅在属于教会的人当中是这样，在教会之外的人当中也是这样，如在阿拉伯人、亚兰人或叙利亚人和希腊人当中，这从那些时代的书籍，无论圣的还是俗的明显看出来。<br />所罗门正是模仿这些书写了雅歌，因为所罗门是从这些书中得到它的；事实上，这本书并不是一本圣书，因为它不像圣书那样里面包含一系列天上的神性事物。约伯记也是古教会的一本书。经上，如摩西五经（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">27</a>ff）还提到现已遗失的古教会的圣书。这些书的历史部分被称为“耶和华战记”，它们的预言部分被称为“诗歌”（参看<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2897.htm">2897</a>节）。被称为“耶和华战记”的历史部分的风格就具有这种性质，这一事实从摩西所摘录并引用的部分内容明显看出来。因此，他们的历史叙述接近于一种预言的风格，具有这种性质，小孩子，以及简单人可以将这些事物保留在自己的记忆中。上面（民数记21章）所提到的那些书是神圣的，这一点从现存于21章28-30节的部分内容明显看出来，可与耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.45.htm">48:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.46.htm">46</a>）相对照，那里有类似的话。在教会之外的人当中，这种风格是那时最常使用的，几乎是唯一的风格，这从那些教会之外的作家所写的寓言或神话传说清楚看出来；他们将是非对错的道德观念，或诸如属于情感和生命的那类事物都包裹在这些寓言或神话传说中。<br />在真实而非虚构的历史叙述中，就是像创世记头几章虚构的历史章节之后出现在摩西五经中的历史，以及出现在约书亚记、士师记、撒母耳记、列王纪中的历史，“内袍”（tunic，或译内衣，里衣、上衣、衣服等）也表示从属天真理和良善发出的属灵真理和真理之良善。要知道，属灵真理和良善就是在中间或第二层天堂的属灵天使所享有的那种真理和良善；但属天真理和良善则是在第三或至内层天堂的属天天使所享有的那种真理和良善（参看<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节所提到的地方）。摩西五经提到，约瑟的父亲以色列给了他儿子约瑟一件彩衣，他的哥哥们为此感到恼火，后来就剥了这彩衣，把它染了血，打发人送到他们父亲那里（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.3.htm">37:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.31.htm">31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.33.htm">33</a>）。这一切都真实的历史；由于它们里面，也就是其内义里面同样包含天堂和教会的神圣事物，因而包含神性事物，所以“彩衣”（tunic of various colors）表示约瑟所代表的良善和真理的状态，这是一种从属天层发出的属灵真理和良善的状态（参看<a href="3971.htm">3971</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>，<a href="4963.htm">4963</a>，<a href="5249.htm">5249</a>，<a href="5307.htm">5307</a>，<a href="5584.htm">5584</a>，<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>，<a href="6417.htm">6417</a>，<a href="6526.htm">6526</a>，<a href="9671.htm">9671</a>节）。因为雅各所有的儿子都代表诸如属于天堂和教会、在自己适当秩序中的那类事物（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4603.htm">4603</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>，<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>节）。但在上面所提到的那一章，他们代表对立面。<br />包含在圣言书卷，无论历史书卷还是预言书卷中的一切事物都是神性属天和属灵事物的代表，并用来表示这些事物，所以在诗篇，“王的女儿”描述了对属灵真理的情感，她的“衣服”描述了真理本身：<br />有列王的女儿在你尊贵妇女之中；王后佩戴最美的俄斐金饰站在你右边。推罗的女儿必带来供物，民中的富人也必求你的脸面。王的女儿在里面极其荣华，她的衣裳是用金线织的。她要穿刺绣衣服，被引到王前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.9.htm">45:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“女儿”一般表示对属灵真理和良善的情感，因而也表示教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>，<a href="9055.htm">9055</a>e节）；当论及主时，“王”表示神性真理（<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）。由此明显可知，该诗篇所讲述的关于王的女儿的这一切事物都表示教会中诸如属于对从主所获得的真理和良善的情感的那类事物。经上说“推罗的女儿必带来供物”表示关于良善和真理的认知或知识，“推罗”表示这些认知或知识（参看<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。“民中的富人”所表相同，因为“富人”在灵义上只表示关于良善和真理的认知或知识，并不表示别的（<a href="1694.htm">1694</a>，<a href="4508.htm">4508</a>节）。由此明显可知“王的女儿在里面极其荣华”、“她的衣裳是用金线织的”表示什么；因为她的“衣裳”是指一件内衣或里衣（tunic），这从这个词在原文的含义明显看出来；因为在原文，这个词表示贴身的衣裳。它是指一件内衣或里衣，这一点清楚可见于约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.23.htm">19:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.24.htm">24</a>），那里提到主的里衣，这里衣在诗篇（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗22.18.htm">22:18</a>）同样被称为“衣裳”。这一点也清楚可见于撒母耳记下（<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.18.htm">13:18</a>），在那里，经上说，王的女儿（经上译为公主）穿着彩衣，如下文所述。诗篇中“金线织的”与“亚伦内袍用织工织的”所表相同，原文用的是相同的词。至于她被引到王前所要穿的“刺绣衣服（或刺绣内袍）”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="9688.htm">9688</a>节）。<br />由于王的女儿和她的衣服或内衣表示这类事物，所以那个时代王的女儿或公主就穿这种衣服，这清楚可见于撒母耳记下：<br />那时她玛穿着彩衣，因为王的女儿都是这样穿的。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.18.htm">13:18</a>）<br />由于内袍（tunic，或译内衣，里衣、上衣、衣服等）代表属灵良善和真理，故可以看出“亚伦的内袍”表示什么，以及本章下一节所提到的他儿子的内袍表示什么；在那里，经上说他们“要为亚伦的儿子作内袍，腰带，裹头巾，为荣耀，为华美”。由于他们的内袍代表这些神圣事物，所以经上说，亚伦的儿子拿答和亚比户因用凡火上香被天上的火烧灭，他们穿着内袍被抬到营外（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.5.htm">5</a>）。“凡火”表示来自某个其它源头，而非天堂之物的爱，因为在圣言中，“圣火”是指天上或神性的爱（<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="6834.htm">6834</a>，<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>，<a href="7324.htm">7324</a>，<a href="9434.htm">9434</a>节）。因此，由于亚伦的儿子所做的事，他们的“内袍”所表示的属灵良善和真理被玷污了，这就是为何他们穿着内袍被抬到营外。<br />在弥迦书，“里衣”（tunic，或译内袍，内衣、上衣、衣服等）所表相同：<br />我的民因衣裳起来如仇敌，你们剥去那些安然经过之人身上的里衣。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥2.8.htm">2:8</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“里衣”在原文是用另一个词来表述的；然而，所表示的仍是属灵的真理和良善；“剥去那些安然经过之人身上的里衣”表示剥夺那些过着一种简单良善生活之人的属灵真理；“因衣裳起来（视人）如仇敌”表示由于他们所认为的真理而向他们行恶，而事实上，只要处于良善，没有人会由于凡他以之为真理的而受到伤害（<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="1799.htm">1799</a>，<a href="1834.htm">1834</a>，<a href="1844.htm">1844</a>节）。<br />由此可见马太福音中的“里衣”表示什么：<br />耶稣说，什么誓都不可起。不可指着天起誓，不可指着地起誓，也不可指着耶路撒冷起誓，又不可指着你的头起誓。你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是出于那恶者。有人想要告你，要拿你的里衣，连外衣也由他拿去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.34.htm">5:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.40.htm">40</a>）<br />人若不知道在主的属天国度的天使是何状态，就不可能知道主的这些话是什么意思。因为此处论述的主题是与主的属天国度的天使同在的良善和真理的状态，对他们来说，一切真理都住在里面，铭刻在他们心上。因为对主之爱的良善引导他们认识一切真理，并且认识得如此透彻，以致他们从来不像属灵国度里的天使那样去推理它。因此，当提到真理时，他们只是说是，是；或说不是，不是；事实上，在属天国度，他们甚至不提信。关于这些天使的状态，可参看9277节所提到的地方。由此明显可知，“不可起誓”这条禁令是什么意思；因为“起誓”表示确认真理（<a href="3375.htm">3375</a>，<a href="9166.htm">9166</a>节），确认真理在属灵国度通过运用理性和取自圣言的记忆知识来进行。“告，想要拿里衣”表示争论真理，以及想要说服别人相信某事不是真的；“里衣”表示来自一个属天源头的真理；因为属天之人会让各人去持守各自的真理，而不会和他继续理论。<br />在马太福音的另一处，“里衣”（tunic，或译内袍，内衣、上衣、衣服等）也表示来自一个属天源头的真理：<br />耶稣差这十二个人去传天国，说腰袋里不要带金银铜钱；途中不要带行囊，不要带两件里衣，也不要带两双鞋和两个拐杖。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这些话代表那些处于从主所获得的良善和真理之人根本没有来源于他们自己的任何良善或真理，相反他们所拥有的一切真理和良善皆来自主。因为十二个门徒代表所有处于来自主的良善和真理之人，在抽象意义上代表源于主的一切爱之良善和一切信之真理（<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>e，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）。“腰袋里的金银铜钱”和“行囊”表示源于自我，而非源于主的良善和真理；“里衣、鞋和拐杖”表示来自主的真理和良善：“里衣”表示内层真理，或来自一个属天源头的真理，“鞋”表示外层真理，或属世层中的真理（<a href="1748.htm">1748</a>，<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>节），“拐杖”表示真理的能力（<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>，<a href="4936.htm">4936</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7026.htm">7026</a>节）。然而，“两件里衣”、“两双鞋”和“两个拐杖”表示既来源于主，也来源于自我的真理及其能力。他们被允许有一件里衣，一双鞋和一个拐杖，这一事实明显可见于马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.8.htm">6:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.9.htm">9</a>）和路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.2.htm">9:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.3.htm">3</a>）。<br />一旦从这些例子知道“里衣”表示什么，那么“主的里衣”表示什么就显而易见了；对此，我们在约翰福音中读到：<br />他们就拿衣服分为四份，每兵一份；又拿里衣。这件里衣原来没有缝儿，是从上头整片织成的。他们就说，我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看是谁的。这要应验经上的话说，他们彼此分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。兵丁果然做了这事。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.23.htm">19:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.24.htm">24</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗22.18.htm">22:18</a>）<br />若运用在某种程度上被光照的理性想一想，谁看不出这一切表示神性事物？否则经上怎会在大卫诗篇中预言它们呢？然而，没有内义，因而没有从内义所获得的知识，没有人知道它们表示什么；也就是说，没有人知道“衣服”、“拈阄”、“分它们”、“里衣”、它“原来没有缝儿”，或“从上头整片织成”，以及“士兵”分别表示什么。从内义明显可知，“衣服”表示真理，“主的衣服”表示神性真理；“拈阄”和“分它们”表示把这些真理拆散并驱散它们（<a href="9093.htm">9093</a>节）；“里衣”表示从神性属天层发出的属灵层的神性真理，与“亚伦的内袍”所表相同，因为亚伦代表主；它“原来没有缝儿”，或“从上头整片织成”与描述亚伦内袍的“织工”所表相同。里衣没有分开表示直接从属天层的神性真理发出的属灵层的神性真理无法被驱散，因为这真理是圣言的内在真理，就是诸如与天上的天使同在的那种。<br />当经上说“兵丁做了这事”时，意思是说，这事是那些本应为真理而争战的人，也就是有圣言在中间的犹太人行出的，但他们具有这样的性质，他们会驱散它。因为他们虽有圣言，却不愿从圣言知道主就是弥赛亚，是那要到来的神的儿子。他们也不愿知道关于圣言内在意义的任何事，只想知道外在意义；他们还抽取外在意义用来服务于他们自己的爱，这些爱都是对自我和世界的爱，他们还由此用来支持从这些爱中涌出的欲望。“分主的衣服”就表示这些事；因为凡他们对主所行的，都代表那时在他们当中的神性真理和神性良善的状态；因此，他们对待神之真理的方式就是他们对待主的方式。在世时的主就是神性真理本身（参看<a href="9199.htm">9199</a>e，<a href="9315.htm">9315</a>e节所提到的地方）。</p>

And thou shalt checker the tunic of fine linen. That this signifies the inmost things of the spiritual kingdom that proceed from the truths of celestial love, is evident from the signification of Aaron's 
garments in general, as being the spiritual kingdom joined to the celestial kingdom (see n. 9814), and as the tunic was the inmost of these garments, therefore by it are signified the inmost things 
of this kingdom (that "Aaron's tunic" denotes the Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom that proceeds immediately from the Divine celestial, see n. 9826); and from the signification of "fine linen," 
as being truth from a celestial origin (see n. 9469). Of this tunic it is said that it was to be checkered, and by what is checkered is meant the work of a weaver, and by "the work of a weaver" is signified 
that which is from the celestial (n. 9915); the word by which "checkering" is expressed in the original tongue, means also "weaving." [2] That this tunic was woven, or from the work of the weaver, 
is evident from what follows in the book of Exodus: </p>
<p>     They made tunics of fine linen, the work of the weaver, for Aaron and his sons (Exod. 39:27). That it was checkered, that is, woven, of 
fine linen, was for the reason that there might be represented that which proceeds immediately from the celestial, which is relatively as it were continuous; for the things which proceed from the celestial 
are like those which with man proceed from his will; for all things with man that belong to the understanding proceed from his will. Those things which proceed interiorly from the will are as 
it were continuous relatively to those which proceed exteriorly; and therefore among those things which proceed interiorly from the will there is especially the affection of truth; for all the affection 
of love in the understanding flows in from the man's will. The case is similar in the heavens, where the celestial kingdom corresponds to the will of man, and the spiritual kingdom to his understanding 
(see n. 9835); and because the garments of Aaron represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom joined to His celestial kingdom (n. 9814), therefore the tunic represented that which is inmost there, thus 
that which proceeds most closely from the celestial kingdom, for the tunic was the inmost garment. From this it is evident why the tunic was woven or checkered, and why it was of fine linen; for by 
"that which is woven" is signified that which is from the will, or from the celestial (n. 9915), and by "fine linen" is signified the truth which is from celestial love (n. 9469). [3] The spiritual 
which is from the celestial is also signified in other parts of the Word by "tunics," as by "the tunics of skin" which Jehovah God is said to have made for the man and his wife after they had eaten of 
the tree of knowledge (Gen. 3:20, 21). That by these "tunics" is signified truth from a celestial origin, cannot be known unless these things are unfolded according to the internal sense; and therefore 
this shall be unfolded. By the man and his wife is there meant the celestial church, by the man himself as a husband is meant this church as to good, and by his wife this church as to truth. This truth 
and that good were the truth and good of the celestial church. But when this church had fallen, which took place by means of reasonings from memory-knowledges about truths Divine, and which is signified 
in the internal sense by the persuasion of the serpent, this first state after the fall of that celestial church is what is there described, and its truth is described by "the tunics of skin." 
 [4] Be it known that by the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis, in the internal sense, is meant and described the new creation, or regeneration, of the man of the church at 
that time, thus the setting up of a celestial church; and that by the paradise are meant and described the wisdom and intelligence of that church, and by eating of the tree of knowledge its fall in 
consequence of reasoning from memory-knowledges about Divine things. That such is the meaning may be seen from what has been shown on this subject in the explications at those chapters. For all the things 
contained in the first chapters of Genesis are made up historical things, in the internal sense of which, as before said, are Divine things concerning the new creation or regeneration of the man 
of the celestial church. This method of writing was customary in the most ancient times, not only among those who were of the church, but also among those who were outside the church, as among the Arabians, 
Syrians, and Greeks, as is evident from the books of those times, both sacred and profane. [5] In imitation of these books, because derived from them, the Song of Songs was written by Solomon; 
for this book is not a holy book, because it does not contain within it heavenly and Divine things in a series, as do the holy books. The book of Job also is a book of the Ancient Church. Mention is 
also made of holy books of the Ancient Church which are now lost, as in Moses (Num. 21:14, 15, 27, and following verses). The historical parts of these books were called "the Wars of Jehovah," and their 
prophetical parts were called "the Enunciations" (see n. 2686, 2897). That in the historical parts of the books called "the Wars of Jehovah," the style was of this nature, is clear from what has been 
taken from them and quoted by Moses. In this way their historical things approached a certain prophetic style, of such a nature that the things might be retained in the memory by little children and 
also by the simple. That the books named above were holy, is evident from what is quoted in verses 28, 29, and 30 of the same chapter, when compared with what is found in Jeremiah 48:45, 46, where there 
are similar expressions. That among people outside the church such a style was very much used at that time, and was almost the only style, is clear from the fables of those writers who were outside 
the church, in which they wrapped up moral things, or such as belong to the affections and life. [6] In the historical things that were not made up, but were true, such as are those in the books of 
Moses after the first chapters of Genesis, and likewise in the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, "tunics" also signified spiritual truth, and the good of truth, that proceed from celestial 
truth and good. (Be it known that spiritual truth and good are such as are the truth and good of the angels in the middle or second heaven; but that celestial truth and good are such as are the truth 
and good of the angels in the third or inmost heaven, see the places cited in n. 9277.) It is recorded in the books of Moses that Israel the father gave to Joseph his son a tunic of various colors, and 
that on account of this his brethren were indignant, and afterward stripped it off and dipped it in blood and sent it so to their father (Gen. 37:3, 23, 31-33). These were true historicals, and as 
these in like manner contained within them, or in the internal sense, holy things of heaven and the church, thus Divine things, therefore by that "tunic of various colors" was signified the state of good 
and truth which Joseph represented, which was a state of spiritual truth and good that proceed from the celestial (see n. 3971, 4286, 4592, 4963, 5249, 5307, 5584, 5869, 5877, 6417, 6526, 9671). For 
all the sons of Jacob represented in their order such things as belong to heaven and the church (n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 4603, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7996); but in this case they represented 
the opposite things. [7] As all things contained in the books of the Word, both the historical and prophetical, are representative and significative of Divine celestial and spiritual things, therefore 
the affection of this truth is described by the "king's daughter," and the truth itself by her "garments," in David: </p>
<p>     The king's daughter is among Thy precious ones; at Thy right hand doth 
stand the queen in the best gold of Ophir. The daughter of Tyre shall bring an offering; the rich of the people shall entreat Thy faces. The king's daughter is all glorious within; thy* clothing (thy* 
tunic) is of weavings (or checkering) of gold. She shall be brought to the king in broidered work (Ps. 45:9, 12-14). (That a "daughter" in general signifies the affection of spiritual truth and good, 
thus also the church, see n. 2362, 3024, 3963, 9055e; and that a "king," when said of the Lord, signifies Divine truth, n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5068, 6148.) From this it is evident that all 
those things which are related in this psalm about the king's daughter signify such things as belong to the affection of truth and good from the Lord in the church. Its being said that "the daughter 
of Tyre shall bring an offering," signifies the knowledges of good and truth (that "Tyre" signifies these, see n. 1201); in like manner "the rich of the people," for by "riches" in the spiritual sense 
nothing else is meant than the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1694, 4508). From this it is evident what is signified by "the king's daughter being glorious within," and that "her clothing was of the 
weavings of gold;" for by her "clothing" is meant a tunic, as is evident from the signification of this word in the original tongue, where it signifies the garment next the body. That it means a tunic 
is evident in John 19:23, 24, where the Lord's tunic is described, which in David (Ps. 22:18) is called, by the same word, "clothing." So in the second book of Samuel (13:18), it is said that the king's 
daughters were clad in tunics of divers colors (of which below). By "the weavings of gold" in David the like is meant as by "the checkerings of the tunic of Aaron," the same word being used in the 
original tongue. (What is meant by the "broidered work" in which she was to be brought to the king, see n. 9688.) [8] As such things were represented by the king's daughter and by her garment, or 
tunic, therefore a king's daughters were at that time clothed in this manner, as is evident in the second book of Samuel: </p>
<p>     There was upon Tamar a tunic of divers colors; for with such wraps were 
the king's daughters clothed (2 Sam. 13:18). [9] Now as spiritual goods and truths were represented by tunics, it can be seen what is signified by "Aaron's tunic," also what by "the tunics of his sons," 
which are spoken of in the following verse of the present chapter, where it is said that "for Aaron's sons they should make tunics, belts, and tiaras, for glory and for comeliness." And as their tunics 
represented these holy things, it was said that Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron, who were burnt by fire from heaven, because they offered incense from strange fire, were brought forth outside 
the camp in their tunics (Lev. 10:1-5); for by "strange fire" is signified love from some other source than what is celestial, for in the Word "holy fire" denotes celestial or Divine love (n. 6832, 6834, 
6849, 7324, 9434). Consequently the spiritual goods and truths signified by their "tunics" were defiled, and therefore they were brought forth outside the camp in their tunics. [10] The like is also 
signified by "tunic" in Micah: </p>
<p>     My people holds as an enemy by reason of a garment; ye strip the tunic from off them that pass by securely (Micah 2:8); </p>
<p>in this passage "tunic" is expressed in 
the original tongue by another word, which, however, signifies spiritual truth and good; "stripping the tunic from off them that pass by securely" denotes to deprive of their spiritual truths those 
who live in simple good; "to hold anyone as an enemy by reason of a garment" denotes to do evil to them on account of the truth which they think, when yet no one is to be injured on account of what he 
believes to be true, provided he is in good (n. 1798, 1799, 1834, 1844). [11] From all this it can now be seen what is signified by a "tunic" in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Swear not at all; neither 
by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by the head. Let your discourse be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay. Whatsoever is beyond these is from evil. If any man would drag thee to the law, and take 
away thy tunic, let him have thy cloak also (Matt. 5:34-37, 40). he who does not know what is the state of the angels in the Lord's celestial kingdom, cannot possibly know what these words of the Lord 
involve; for the subject here treated of is the state of good and truth with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, with whom all truth is imprinted on the heart. For from the good of love to 
the Lord they know all truth, insomuch that they never reason about it, as is done in the spiritual kingdom; and therefore when truths are being spoken of, they only say, Yea, yea, or Nay, nay; and 
they do not even mention faith there. (Concerning their state see the places cited in n. 9277.) From this then it is evident what is signified by the injunction "swear not at all;" for by "swearing" is 
signified to confirm truths (n. 3375, 9166), which is done in the spiritual kingdom by means of the rational, and memory-knowledges from the Word. By "dragging to the law, and desiring to take away 
the tunic," is meant to debate about truths, and to wish to persuade that they are not true; a "tunic" denotes truth from what is celestial; for the celestial leave to everyone his truth without further 
reasoning. [12] By a "tunic" is signified the truth from what is celestial in another passage also in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus sent the twelve to preach the kingdom of the heavens, saying that they should 
not possess gold, nor silver, nor brass in their girdles; nor a scrip for the journey; neither two tunics, nor shoes, nor staves (Matt. 10:5, 7, 9, 10). By these words was represented that those 
who are in goods and truths from the Lord possess nothing of good and truth from themselves, but that they have all truth and good from the Lord. For by the twelve disciples were represented all who 
are in goods and truths from the Lord, and in the abstract sense all goods of love and truths of faith from the Lord (n. 3488, 3858, 6397). Goods and truths from self, and not from the Lord, are signified 
by "possessing gold, silver, and brass in the girdles," and by a "scrip;" but truths and goods from the Lord are signified by "a tunic, shoe, and staff;" by "the tunic," interior truth, or truth 
from the celestial; by "the shoe," exterior truth, or truth in the natural (n. 1748, 6844); and by "the staff," the power of truth (n. 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026). But by "two tunics," "two pairs of 
shoes," and "two staves," are signified truths and their powers from both the Lord and self. That they were allowed to have one tunic, one pair of shoes, and one staff, is evident in Mark 6:8, 9, and 
in Luke 9:2, 3. [13] When it is known from these examples what is signified by a "tunic," it is manifest what is signified by "the Lord's tunic," of which we read in John: </p>
<p>     They took the garments, 
and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and the tunic; and the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said, Let us not divide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; 
that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They divided My garments among them, and upon My tunic did they cast a lot. These things the soldiers did (John 19:23, 24; also Ps. 22:18). Who cannot 
see, if he thinks from reason at all enlightened, that these proceedings signified Divine things, and that otherwise they would not have been foretold by David? But what they signify cannot be known 
without the internal sense, thus without knowledge therefrom as to what is signified by "garments;" by "casting lots" upon, or "dividing" them; by a "tunic;" and by its being "without seam," that 
is, woven throughout; and by "soldiers." From the internal sense it is plain that by "garments" are signified truths, and by "the Lord's garments," Divine truths; by "casting a lot," and "dividing" them 
is meant to pull these truths asunder and disperse them (n. 9093); by the "tunic" is signified Divine spiritual truth from the Divine celestial, the like as by "Aaron's tunic," because Aaron represented 
the Lord; so also by its being "without seam," and "woven from the top throughout," the like is signified as by the "checkered," or woven, "work," in Aaron's tunic. That the tunic was not divided 
signified that the Divine spiritual truth which proceeds most nearly from Divine celestial truth could not be dispersed, because this truth is the internal truth of the Word, such as is with the angels 
in heaven.  [14] Its being said that "the soldiers did this," signifies that it was done by those who should fight for truths, thus by the Jews themselves, with whom was the Word, and who nevertheless 
were of such a nature that they dispersed it. For they had the Word, and yet they were not willing to know from it that the Lord was the Messiah and the Son of God who was to come, nor anything 
internal of the Word, but only what is external; which they also wrested to their loves, which were the loves of self and of the world, thus to favor the lusts which spring from these loves. These things 
were signified by "the dividing of the Lord's garments;" for whatever they did to the Lord represented the state of Divine truth and Divine good among them at that time; thus that they treated Divine 
truths in the same way as they treated Him. (That the Lord while in the world was the Divine truth itself, see the places cited in n. 9199, 9315.) * Here "thy," but "her" in n. 3081 and 5044. [REVISER] </p>

'And you shall weave the tunic in checker work of fine linen' means the inmost things of the spiritual kingdom, emanating from the truths of celestial love. This is clear from the meaning of Aaron's 
garments in general as the spiritual kingdom lying adjacent to the celestial kingdom, dealt with in <a href="9814.htm">9814</a>, and since the tunic was the inmost of those garments the inmost things of that kingdom are meant 
by it (for the meaning of 'Aaron's tunic' as Divine Truth in the spiritual kingdom, emanating directly from the Divine Celestial, see <a href="9826.htm">9826</a>); and from the meaning of 'fine linen' as truth from a celestial 
origin, dealt with in <a href="9469.htm">9469</a>. In the words stating that the tunic should be woven in checker work something produced by a weaver should be understood by 'checker work'; and by 'the work of a weaver' 
is meant that which is from the celestial, <a href="9915.htm">9915</a>. The same word is used in the original language to express the idea of producing checker work as is used to mean weaving.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that this 
tunic was woven, or was made from the work of a weaver, is clear from the following words in the Book of Exodus,  </p>
<blockquote>
They made the tunics of fine linen, the work of a weaver, for Aaron and his sons. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2039:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 39:27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why the tunic consisted of checker work or was woven from fine linen was in order that it might represent that which emanates directly from the celestial; in comparison it 
resembles a continuation from it. For what emanates from the celestial is akin to what does so from the will part of a person's mind, in that everything which belongs to a person's understanding emanates 
from that will part. What emanates from the will part and exists more internally is so to speak continuous from it, in contrast to what does so but exists more externally. Therefore that more internal 
emanation from the will has primarily the affection for truth within it; for all affection belonging to love that is present in the understanding flows in from its will part. A similar situation 
exists in the heavens, where the celestial kingdom corresponds to the will part of a person's mind, and the spiritual kingdom to the understanding part, see <a href="9835.htm">9835</a>. And since Aaron's garments represented 
the Lord's spiritual kingdom lying adjacent to His celestial kingdom, <a href="9814.htm">9814</a>, the tunic represented that which is inmost there, namely that which emanates from and exists closest to the celestial kingdom; 
for the tunic was the inmost garment. From this it is evident why it was woven or made of checker work, and why it was made from fine linen. For 'woven' means that which originates in the will part 
or the celestial, <a href="9915.htm">9915</a>, and 'fine linen' means truth that springs from celestial love, <a href="9469.htm">9469</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What is spiritual emanating from what is celestial is also meant in other places in the Word by 
tunics, for example by the tunics of skin which Jehovah God is said to have made for the man and his wife after they ate from the tree of knowledge, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3:20, 21</a>. No one can know that truth from a celestial 
origin is meant by those 'tunics' unless the inner meaning of the details of that story is unfolded; therefore it must be explained. 'The man and his wife' there is used to mean the celestial 
Church, 'the man' as the husband to mean that Church in respect of good, and 'his wife' that Church in respect of truth; this truth and that good were the celestial Church's truth and good. But then came 
the fall of that Church, which was brought about by reasonings, based on factual knowledge, about God's truths, meant in the internal sense by 'the serpent' who persuaded them. The first state after 
the fall of that Church is what is described here, its truth by 'the tunics of skin'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It should be remembered that the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis means and 
describes in the internal sense the new creation or regeneration of the member of the Church then, thus the establishment of the celestial Church; that paradise means and describes the wisdom and intelligence 
of that Church, and eating from the tree of knowledge its fall, brought about by their reasoning, based on factual knowledge, about Divine matters. For more which demonstrates that all this 
is so, see what has been shown regarding these matters in the explanations to those chapters. For all the narratives contained in the early chapters of Genesis are made-up history, in the internal sense 
of which there are Divine matters regarding the new creation or the regeneration of the member of the celestial Church, as has been stated. This was the customary way of writing in most ancient times, 
not only among those who belonged to the Church but also among those outside the Church, for example among the Arabians, Syrians, and Greeks, as is evident from the books of those times, both sacred 
and secular.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It was in imitation of those books, since he derived it from them, that Solomon composed the Song of Songs, a book that is not a sacred one because it does not inwardly contain 
heavenly and Divine matters forming a continuous train of thought, such as sacred books contain. The Book of Job too is a book of the Ancient Church. Mention is also made in Moses of sacred books of 
the Ancient Church which have now been lost, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:14,%2015,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:14, 15, 27</a>ff, the historical sections of which were called The Wars of Jehovah and the prophetical parts The Utterances, see <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, <a href="2897.htm">2897</a>. The fact 
that such was the style in the historical narratives of the sections called The Wars of Jehovah is evident from the parts of them which were extracted and quoted by Moses. Their historical narratives 
were therefore such as came near to a kind of prophetic style, the kind that would allow young children and also simple people to retain things in their memory. The fact that the books referred to in 
Numbers <a href="21.htm">21</a> were sacred is evident from the parts of them extant in verses 28-30 of that chapter, when compared with <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%2048:45,%2046&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 48:45, 46</a>, where similar words occur. This kind of style was the most common, 
virtually the one and only style adopted among those who were outside the Church, as is plain from the myths and legends of those writers who were outside the Church which held within them notions 
of right and wrong or such as have to do with what people feel and how they conduct their life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the narratives consisting not of made-up but of genuine history - which are those that appear 
in the Books of Moses after the chapters of made-up history, and also those in the Books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings - spiritual truth and good of truth emanating from celestial truth and 
good are again meant by 'tunics'. (It should be remembered that spiritual truth and good is the kind of truth and good that spiritual angels in the middle or second heaven enjoy, but that celestial truth 
and good is the truth and good such as angels in the third and inmost heaven enjoy, see the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>.) The Books of Moses mention that Israel the father of Joseph gave his son a 
tunic of various colours, and that because of that tunic his brothers were annoyed; and that subsequently they stripped him of it, dipped it in blood, and sent it in that condition to their father, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2037:3,%2023,%2031-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 37:3, 23, 31-33</a>. All this was part of genuine history; and since it in like manner contained inwardly or in its internal sense the holy things of heaven and the Church, thus those that were Divine, 
that tunic of various colours served to mean the state of the good and truth which Joseph was to represent, namely the state of spiritual truth and good emanating from the celestial, see <a href="3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>,

 Since all things that are in the books of the Word are representative 
of and serve to mean Divine celestial and spiritual realities, both those things in the historical books and those in the prophetical books, the affection for spiritual truth is described in David 
by 'the king's daughter' and the actual truth by her garments,  </p>
<blockquote>
Daughters of kings are among your precious ones; at your right hand stands the queen in the finest gold of Ophir. The daughter of 
Tyre will bring an offering, the rich of the people will entreat your face. All glorious is the king's daughter within, from woven threads (or checker work) of gold will her vesture (her tunic) be; in 
an embroidered [robe] she will be led to the king. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2045:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 45:9</a>

ff.  </p>
<p>'Daughter' in general means the affection for spiritual truth and good, and so means the Church as well, see <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>, <a href="9055.htm">9055</a>

From this it is evident that everything mentioned in that Psalm regarding 'the king's daughter' 
means such things as belong to the affection for truth and good received from the Lord in the Church. When it says that 'the daughter of Tyre will bring an offering' cognitions or knowledge of 
good and truth are meant, 'Tyre' meaning these, see <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. The like is meant by 'the rich of the people', for nothing other than cognitions of good and truth is meant in the spiritual sense by 'riches', 
<a href="1694.htm">1694</a>, <a href="4508.htm">4508</a>. From this it is evident what the meaning is of the declaration that the king's daughter is 'all glorious within', and that her vesture was made 'from woven threads of gold'. By 'her vesture' 
a tunic should be understood, as is evident from the meaning that word has in the original language; for the word in that language means a garment worn next to the body. The fact that a tunic is 
meant is clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2019:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 19:24</a>, where reference is made to the Lord's tunic, which David in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2022:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 22:18</a> calls by the same word 'vesture'. It is also clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 13:18</a>, where it says that the king's daughters 
were clothed with tunics of various colours; this matter is dealt with just below. By 'woven threads of gold' in David something similar is meant to what is meant by the checker work of Aaron's 
tunic, the same term being used in the original language. As regards what 'an embroidered [robe]' is in which she will be led to the king, see <a href="9688.htm">9688</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Since the king's daughter and her vesture 
or tunic served to represent such things, a king's daughters at that time wore that kind of clothing, as is clear in the second Book of Samuel,  </p>
<blockquote>
On Tamar there was a tunic of various colours, for 
daughters of the king wore such clothes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 13:18</a>.

 Since, then, spiritual forms of good and truths were represented by tunics it may be seen what it is that Aaron's 'tunic' means, and also 
what is meant by his sons' tunics, mentioned in the next verse of this chapter, which says that for Aaron's sons they were to make tunics, belts, and headdresses, for glorious adornment. And since their 
tunics served to represent those holy forms of good and truths, it was declared that Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu, who were devoured by fire from heaven because they were offering incense on foreign<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

My people have taken a stand as an enemy on account of the garment; you strip the tunic from those confidently 
passing through. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%202:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 2:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here a different word is used in the original language for 'tunic'; even so spiritual truth and good is meant. 'Stripping the tunic from those passing through in confidence' 
means depriving of their spiritual truths those who lead a life of simple goodness. 'Having [them] as enemy on account of the garment' means doing ill to them on account of the truth they think, 
when in fact no one ought to suffer harm on account of whatever he believes to be true, provided that he is governed by good, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="1799.htm">1799</a>, <a href="1834.htm">1834</a>, <a href="1844.htm">1844</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 From all this it may now be seen what 
'tunic' means in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, You shall not swear at all, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by [your] head. Let your words be, Yes, yes; No, no; anything beyond this 
is from evil.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> If anyone wishes to drag you to court and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:34-37,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:34-37, 40</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone unacquainted with what the angelic state is like in the Lord's 
celestial kingdom cannot have any idea at all of what these the Lord's words imply. For they refer to the state of goodness and truth with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, with whom 
all truth resides within, imprinted on their hearts. For the good of love to the Lord leads them to know all truth, so completely that they never engage in any reasoning about it, as those in the spiritual 
kingdom do. Therefore whenever truths are referred to they say simply, Yes, yes; or, No, no. Nor indeed in that kingdom do they even make mention of faith. Regarding the state of these angels, 
see the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>. From this it is now evident what the meaning is of the command that they must not swear at all; for 'swearing' means confirming truths, <a href="3375.htm">3375</a>, <a href="9166.htm">9166</a>, which is done in 
the spiritual kingdom by the use of reason and factual knowledge drawn from the Word. 'Dragging to court and wishing to take away the tunic' means arguing about truths and wishing to convince others 
that something is not true, 'tunic' meaning truth from a celestial origin; for [those who are celestial] leave every one with the truth he has and do not go on to reason with him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 'Tunic' again 
means truth from a celestial origin elsewhere in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus sent the twelve to preach the kingdom of heaven, saying, that they should not possess gold, or silver, or bronze in their belts, 
nor a bag for the road, nor two tunics, or [pairs of] shoes, or rods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:9, 10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>All this served to represent that those with forms of good and truths received from the Lord possess no good 
or truth at all that originates in themselves, but that every truth and form of good they have comes from the Lord. The twelve disciples represented all whose forms of good and truths come from the Lord, 
and in the abstract sense represented all forms of the good of love and all truths of faith derived from the Lord, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a> (end), <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. Forms of good and truths that originate in the self and not 
in the Lord are meant by 'possessing gold, silver, and bronze in their belts' and by 'a bag'. But truths and forms of good coming from the Lord are meant by 'tunic, shoe, and rod', inner truth or truth 
from a celestial origin by 'tunic', outer truth or truth in the natural by 'shoe', <a href="1748.htm">1748</a>, <a href="6844.htm">6844</a>, and the power of truth by 'rod', <a href="4876.htm">4876</a>, <a href="4936.htm">4936</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7026.htm">7026</a>. By 'two tunics' however, 'two [pairs 
of] shoes, and two rods' are meant truths and their powers that originate both in the Lord and in the self. The fact that they were allowed to have one tunic, one pair of shoes, and one rod is clear in 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%206:8,9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 6:8,9</a>, and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:2, 3</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
 Once it is known from all this what 'a tunic' means it is evident what 'the Lord's tunic' referred to in John means,  </p>
<blockquote>
They took the garments and made four parts, 
a part for each soldier, and the tunic. And the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said, Do not let us divide it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it may be - so that the 
Scripture might be fulfilled, saying, They divided My garments for themselves, and for My tunic they cast lots. The soldiers did these things. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2019:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 19:23, 24</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2022:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 22:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Is there anyone, thinking 
with reason that is to some extent enlightened, who cannot see that in all this Divine things were meant, and that if this had not been so none of it would have been prophesied in David? Yet no one 
can know what is meant without the internal sense, thus without knowledge gained from that sense no one can know what is meant by 'the garments', 'casting lots for' or 'dividing them', 'the tunic' and 
its being 'without seam' or 'woven from the top throughout', and 'the soldiers'. From the internal sense it is evident that truths are meant by 'garments', and Divine Truths by 'the Lord's garments'; 
'casting lots for' and 'dividing them' pulling apart and dispersing them, <a href="9093.htm">9093</a>; and 'the tunic' Divine Truth on the spiritual level, emanating from the Divine Celestial, the same as is meant by 'Aaron's 
tunic' since Aaron represented the Lord, for which reason also its being 'without seam' or 'woven from the top throughout' has the same meaning as 'checkered' or 'woven', which describes Aaron's 
tunic. The tunic's not being divided was a sign that Divine Truth on the spiritual level, emanating directly from Divine Truth on the celestial level, could not be dispersed, because this truth is the 
inner truth of the Word, such as exists with angels in heaven.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 When it says that 'the soldiers did it' the meaning is that it was done by those who ought to have been fighting for truths, that 
is, the Jews themselves with whom the Word existed, but whose characters were nevertheless such that they would disperse it. For they had the Word, yet nevertheless did not wish to know from it that 
the Lord was the Messiah and Son of God who was to come. Nor did they wish to know anything of the inner meaning of the Word, only the outward, which they also drafted to serve their own loves, which 
were self-love and love of the world, and so to support their desires gushing out of those loves. These things are meant by dividing up the Lord's garments; for whatever they did to the Lord represented 
the state of Divine Truth and Good among them then, thus the way they treated God's truths was similar to that in which they were treating Him; for while in the world the Lord was Divine Truth itself,

`Et tesselabis tunicam byssi':  quod significet intima regni spiritualis procedentia ex veris amoris caelestis, constat ex significatione vestium Aharonis {1}in genere, quod sint regnum spirituale adjunctum 
regno caelesti, de qua n. 9814; et quia tunica erat intima vestium illarum, ideo per illam significantur intima (t)regni illius; quod tunica Aharonis sit Divinum Verum in regno spirituali immediate 
procedens a Divino Caelesti, videatur n. 9826; et ex significatione `byssi' quod sit verum ex origine caelesti, de qua n. 9469; de tunica illa dicitur quod tesselaretur, et per tesselatum intelligitur 
opus textoris, et per opus textoris significatur id quod ex caelesti, {2}n. 9915; per eandem vocem qua exprimitur tesselare in lingua originali, (t)etiam significatur texere; quod tunica illa 
texta {6}fuerit, seu ex `opere textoris,' constat ex 2 sequentibus in Libro Exodi; </p>
<p>	Fecerunt tunicas byssi, opus textoris, pro Aharone et filiis ejus, xxxix 27; </p>
<p>quod {4}tesselata fuerit, seu texta ex 
bysso, erat causa ut repraesentaretur id quod immediate procedit ex caelesti, quod est sicut continuum respective; quae enim ex caelesti procedunt sunt sicut quae ex voluntario apud hominem, omnia enim 
quae sunt intellectus apud hominem procedunt ex voluntario ejus; quae interius procedunt (c)ex voluntario, sunt quasi continua respective ad illa quae exterius; quapropter in illis quae interius ex 
voluntario procedunt, est imprimis affectio veri nam omnis affectio quae amoris in {5}intellectu influit ex voluntario ejus; similiter se habet in caelis, ubi caeleste regnum correspondet voluntario 
hominis, et spirituale regnum intellectuali ejus, videatur n. 9835; et quia {6} vestes Aharonis repraesentabant regnum spirituale Domini adjunctum regno caelesti Ipsius, n. (x)9814, ideo tunica repraesentabat 
(c)id quod intimum {7}ibi est, ita quod proxime ex regno caelesti {8}procedit, erat enim tunica intima vestis; inde patet cur texta seu tesselata fuit, et cur ex bysso; per `textum' enim significatur 
id quod ex voluntario seu ex caelesti, n. 9915, et per `byssum' significatur verum 3 quod ex amore caelesti, n. 9469; spirituale quod {9} ex caelesti etiam significatur per tunicas {10} alibi 
in Verbo, {11}sicut per tunicas pellis qua Jehovah Deus dicitur fecisse homini et uxori ejus postquam comederunt ex arbore scientiae, Gen. iii 20, 21; quod per illas `tunicas' significetur verum ex 
origine caelesti, non sciri potest nisi historica illa quoad sensum internum evolvantur, quapropter explicabitur; per `hominem et uxorem' ejus {12}ibi intelligitur Ecclesia caelestis, per ipsum hominem 
ut maritum Ecclesia illa quoad bonum, et per uxorem ejus Ecclesia illa quoad verum; hoc verum et illud bonum fuit {13}verum et bonum Ecclesiae caelestis; cum autem Ecclesia illa lapsa fuit, quod factum 
est per ratiocinationes ex scientificis de (t)veris Divinis, {14}quod in sensu interno significatur per serpentem qui persuasit; {15}hic primus status post lapsum illius Ecclesiae est qui ibi describitur, 
ac verum ejus per tunicas pellis. 	4 Sciendum est quod per creationem caeli et terrae in primo capite Geneseos in sensu interno intelligatur et describatur nova creatio seu regeneratio hominis 
Ecclesiae tunc, ita instauratio Ecclesiae caelestis, et quod per paradisum intelligatur et describatur sapientia et intelligentia illius Ecclesiae, et per esum ex arbore scientiae lapsus illius per 
quod ex scientificis ratiocinati sint de Divinis; quod ita sit, videantur quae de illis in explicationibus ad illa capita ostensa sunt, sunt enim omnia illa quae continentur in primis capitibus Geneseos, 
historica facta, {16}in quorum sensu interno sunt Divina de nova creatione seu regeneratione hominis Ecclesiae caelestis, ut dictum est; ille {17} mos scribendi fuit antiquissimis temporibus, non 
{18}solum apud illos qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt sed etiam apud illos qui extra Ecclesiam, ut apud Arabes, Syros, et Graecos, ut patet a libris illorum temporum tam sacris quam profanis; ad imitamen illorum, 
quia ex illis, conscriptum 5 est Canticum Canticorum a Salomone, qui liber non est liber sacer, quoniam non continet caelestia et Divina in serie intus, sicut libri sacri; Liber Hiobi etiam est liber 
Antiquae Ecclesiae; memorantur etiam libri sacri {19}Antiquae Ecclesiae, qui nunc deperditi sunt, apud Moschen, Num. xxi 14, 15, {20}27 seq., quorum historica dicebantur Bella Jehovae, et prophetica, 
Enuntiata, videatur n. 2686, 2897; quod in historicis illorum quae dicta sunt Bella Jehovae, talis stilus fuerit, patet ex illis (t)ibi quae inde a Mosche desumpta et allata sunt, ita historica illorum 
accedebant ad stilum quendam propheticum, talem ut res ab infantibus et quoque a simplicibus memoria retineri potuissent; quod libri illi ibi citati sacri fuerint, patet ab illis quae ibi vers. 
28-30 exstant, collatis cum illis quae apud Jeremiam xlviii 45, 46, ubi similia. Quod talis stilus apud illos qui extra Ecclesiam fuerunt, eo tempore usitatissimus et fere unicus fuerit, liquet a fabulosis 
illorum scriptorum qui extra Ecclesiam erant, quibus {21}involvebantur moralia seu talia quae affectionum ac vitae sunt. 	In historicis non factis sed veris, quae sunt quae in Libris 6 Moschis 
post illa capita, tum quae in {22}Libris Joschuae, {23} Judicum, {24} Samuelis, et {24} Regum, etiam {25}tunicae significant verum (c)ac bonum veri spirituale procedens ex vero et bono caelesti; (sciendum 
est quod verum et bonum spirituale sit {26}quale est verum et bonum angelorum in {27}medio seu altero caelo; at quod verum et bonum caeleste sit verum et bonum quale est angelorum in tertio seu 
intimo caelo, videantur loca citata n. 9277;) in {28}Libris Moschis memoratur quod Israel pater dederit Josepho filio suo tunicam variorum colorum, et quod propter illam fratres ejus indignati sint, et 
postea exuerint ac intinxerint sanguine, et sic miserint ad patrem suum, Gen. xxxvii 3, 23, 31-33; haec erant historica vera, quae quia similiter intus {29} seu in sensu interno continebant sancta caeli 
et Ecclesiae, ita Divina, per tunicam illam variorum colorum significabatur status boni et veri quem Josephus repraesentaret, qui erat status veri et boni spiritualis procedentis ex caelesti, videatur 
n. 3971, 4286, 4592, 4963, 5249, 5307, (x)5584, 5869, 5877, 6417, 6526, 9671; omnes enim filii Jacobi repraesentabant talia quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae in suo ordine, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 4603 
seq., 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7996, at (x)ibi {30}repraesentabant opposita. 	7 Quoniam omnia quae in libris Verbi repraesentativa ac significativa Divinorum caelestium et spiritualium sunt, 
{31}tam quae in libris historicis quam quae in libris propheticis, ideo affectio illius veri per `filiam regis' ac ipsum verum per vestes ejus describitur apud Davidem, 	{32}Filiae regum inter pretiosas 
tuas; consistit regina ad dextram tuam in auro optimo Ophiris: filia Tyri munus {33}afferet; facies tuas deprecabuntur divites populi; tota gloriosa filia regis intus, a textis (seu tesselatis) 
auri vestimentum {34}suum (tunica {35}sua); in acupictis adducetur regi, Ps. xlv 10 seq. [A. V. 9 seq.]; </p>
<p>quod `filia' in genere significet affectionem {36}veri et boni spiritualis, ita quoque Ecclesiam, 
videatur n. 2362, 3024, 3963, (x)9055 fin., et quod `rex' cum de Domino, significet Divinum Verum, n. 2015, 2069, 3009, (x)4581, 4966, 5068, 6148; inde patet quod omnia illa quae de `filia regis' 
in Psalmo illo memorantur significent talia quae sunt affectionis veri et boni a Domino in Ecclesia; quod dicatur quod `filia Tyri afferet munus' significat {37} cognitiones boni et veri; quod `Tyrus' 
illas significet, videatur n. 1201; similiter `divites populi,' nam per `divitias' in spirituali sensu non aliud quam cognitiones boni et veri intelliguntur, n. 1694, 4508; inde patet quid significatur 
per quod `filia regis gloriosa intus,' et quod `vestimentum ejus esset (c)ex textis auri'; per vestimentum {38}ejus intelligitur tunica, ut patet ab ejus vocis significatione in lingua originali, 
significat enim ibi vestem proximam corpori; quod sit tunica, constat apud Johannem xix 24, ubi de tunica Domini agitur, quae apud Davidem Ps. xxii 19 [A. V. 18] vocatur vestimentum eadem voce; tum in 
Libro 2 Sam. xiii 18, ubi dicitur quod filiae regis tunicis variorum colorum investitae fuerint, de qua re mox sequitur; {39} per `texta auri' apud Davidem intelligitur simile quod per `tesselata tunicae' 
Aharonis, est {40} eadem vox in lingua originali; quid {41} acupictum in quo adducetur regi, videatur n. 9688. 	`Quia per `filiam regis' et per `vestimentum ejus' seu per tunicam 8 ejus, repraesentabantur 
talia, ideo quoque filiae regis eo tempore talibus vestiebantur, {42}ut constat in Libro 2 Samuelis, 	Erat super Thamare tunica variorum colorum; quia talibus vestiebantur filiae regis amiculis, 
xiii 18. Quia nunc bona et {43}vera spiritualia per tunicas repraesentabantur, 9 constare potest quid per tunicam Aharonis significatur, tum quoque quid per tunicas filiorum ejus, de quibus {44}in 
versu sequente hujus capitis, quod filiis Aharonis facerent tunicas, (x)balteos, et tiaras, ad gloriam et ad decus; et quia tunicae illorum sancta illa repraesentabant, ideo {45}dicebatur quod filii 
Aharonis Nadab et Abihu, qui combusti igne e caelo quia ex igne alieno suffiebant, {46} in tunicis educerentur extra castra, Lev. x 1-5, nam per `ignem alienum' significatur amor aliunde quam ex 
caelesti, est enim `ignis sacer' in Verbo amor caelestis seu Divinus, n. 6832, 6834, 6849, 7324, 9434; inde {47}bona et vera spiritualia, quae per `tunicas' eorum significantur, conspurcata {48}erant, 
ac ideo {49}illi in tunicis extra castra educti sunt. 	Simile etiam per `tunicam' significatur apud Micham, 10 	Populus Meus pro hoste statuit propter vestem, tunicam extrahitis a transeuntibus secure, 
(x)ii 8; </p>
<p>ibi tunica alia voce in lingua originali, quae tamen significat verum et bonum spirituale; `tunicam extrahere a transeuntibus secure' est deprivare suis veris spiritualibus illos qui in 
simplici bono vivunt, `pro hoste habere propter vestem' est malum illis facere {50}propter verum quod cogitant, cum tamen nemo laedendus propter {51}id quod credit verum esse, modo in bono sit, n. 1798, 
1799, 1834, 1844. 	11 Ex his nunc constare potest quid significatur per `tunicam' apud Matthaeum, 	Jesus dixit, Non jurabis omnino, neque per caelum, neque per terram, neque per Hierosolymam, neque 
per caput; esto sermo vester, Ita ita, non non, quod ultra haec est, ex malo est; si quis te velit in jus trahere, et tunicam tuam auferre, permitte illi etiam pallium, v 34-36, 37, 40; </p>
<p>qui (x)non 
scit {52}qualis status angelorum in regno caelesti Domini est, nequaquam scire potest quid illa Domini verba involvunt, agitur enim ibi de {53}statu boni et veri apud illos qui in caelesti regno Domini 
sunt, apud quos omne verum inest impressum cordibus; sciunt enim ex bono amoris in Dominum omne verum, usque adeo ut nusquam de eo ratiocinentur, sicut in spirituali regno, {54}quapropter cum agitur 
de veris, modo dicunt, Ita ita, vel, Non non, immo nec nominant ibi fidem, de quo (x)statu illorum videantur loca citata n. 9277; inde nunc patet quid significatur per quod `non jurabunt omnino,' per 
`jurare' enim significatur confirmare vera, n. 3375, 9166, quod fit per {55}rationale (x)et scientifica ex Verbo in spirituali regno; per `trahere in jus, et tunicam velle auferre,' {56}est disceptare 
de veris {57}et velle persuadere quod non verum sit; `tunica' est verum ex caelesti, relinquunt enim cuivis suum verum absque ulteriore ratiocinatione. 	12 Per `tunicam' {58} significatur verum (c)a 
caelesti etiam alibi apud {59}Matthaeum, 	Jesus misit duodecim ad praedicandum regnum caelorum, dicens quod non possiderent aurum, neque argentum, neque aes in zonis suis; nec peram in viam, neque 
binas tunicas, neque calceos, neque baculos, x 9, 10; </p>
<p>per illa repraesentabatur quod qui in bonis et veris a Domino sunt, nihil {60}boni et veri a se possideant, sed quod omne {60}verum et bonum illis 
sit a Domino; per `duodecim discipulos' enim repraesentabantur omnes qui in bonis et veris sunt a Domino, in sensu abstracto omnia bona amoris et vera fidei a Domino, n. 3488, 3858 fin., 6397; bona 
et vera a semet et non a Domino significantur per `possidere aurum, argentum, aes in zonis' et per `peram,' vera autem et bona a Domino significantur per `tunicam, calceum, et baculum,' per `tunicam' 
verum interius seu verum ex caelesti, per `calceum' verum exterius seu verum in naturali {61}, n. 1748, 6844, per `baculum' potentia {62}veri, n. 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026; per `duas' autem `tunicas, 
duos calceos, et duos baculos' vera et illorum potentiae tam (c)a Domino quam ea semet; quod {63}liceret illis habere unam tunicam, unum par calceorum, et unum baculum, constat apud Marcum vi 8, 
9; et apud Lucam ix 2, 3. 	Cum ex his notum est quid per `tunicam' significatur, patet quid 13 per `tunicam Domini,' de qua apud Johannem, 	Acceperunt {64}vestes, et fecerunt quattuor partes, unicuique 
militi partem, et tunicam, et tunica erat inconsuta, desuper texta per totum; dixerunt, Non dividamus illam, sed sortiamur de illa cujus sit; ut scriptura impleretur dicens, Diviserunt vestes Meas 
sibi ipsis, et super tunicam Meam jecerunt sortem; milites haec fecerunt, xix 23, 24; Ps. xxii 19 [A.V. 18]; </p>
<p>quis non videre potest, qui ex ratione aliquantum illustrata cogitat, quod illa significaverint 
Divina, et quod alioquin de illis apud Davidem non prophetatum fuisset? quid autem significant, non sciri absque sensu interno potest, ita non absque cognitione inde, quid {65}significant `vestes,' 
quid `sortem jacere' super illis seu `dividere,' quid `tunica,' et quod `inconsuta' seu 'desuper texta per totum,' et {66} quid `milites'; ex sensu interno patet quod per `vestes' significentur vera, 
et per `vestes Domini' Divina Vera, per `jacere sortem {67} et dividere' {68} distrahere illa et dissipare, n. 9093; per `tunicam' Divinum Verum spirituale ex Divino Caelesti, simile quod per tunicam 
Aharonis, quoniam Aharon repraesentabat Dominum, ita quoque per quod illa inconsuta et texta desuper per totum, simile quod per tesselatum seu textum de tunica Aharonis; quod {69}tunica non divideretur, 
significabat quod Divinum Verum spirituale proxime procedens ex Divino Vero caelesti, non dissipari potuerit, quia id verum est verum internum Verbi, quale 14 apud angelos in caelo; quod dicatur 
quod milites id fecerint, significat quod illi pugnarent pro veris, ita ipsi Judaei, apud quos fuit Verbum, {70} qui tamen usque tales fuerunt ut dissiparent illud; nam {71} Verbum habebant, usque 
tamen non inde scire volebant, quod Dominus esset Messias ac Filius Dei, Qui venturus, nec aliquid internum {72}Verbi, sed modo externum, quod etiam trahebant ad amores suos, qui erant amores sui et mundi, 
ita ad favorem cupiditatum inde scaturientium; haec significantur per divisionem vestimentorum Domini; nam quicquid illi fecerunt Domino, repraesentabat statum Divini Veri ac Boni tunc apud illos, 
ita quod similiter vera Divina {73}tractarent sicut Ipsum, nam Dominus cum in mundo fuit, erat ipsum Divinum Verum, videantur citata n. 9199 fin., {74} 9315 fin. @1 After constat$ @2 i videatur$ @3
