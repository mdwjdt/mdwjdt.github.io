<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9088节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9088.</strong>“要拿银子赔偿它的主人”表通过与其属世人中的良善或真理已经被败坏之人同在的真理。这从“银子”和“它的主人”的含义清楚可知：“银子”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6112.htm">6112</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="7999.htm">7999</a>节），“拿银子”是指通过真理赎回（<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）；“它的主人”，即掉在坑里头的牛的主人，是指其属世人中的良善或真理已经被败坏的人。因为“牛”是指属世人中的良善，“驴”是指那里的真理（<a href="9065.htm">9065</a>，<a href="9086.htm">9086</a>节）；“掉在坑里头”表示败坏它们（<a href="9086.htm">9086</a>节）。<br />此处的情形是这样：如果良善或真理被虚假败坏，那么被败坏的东西必须通过真理来修正，在教会里则通过出于圣言的真理，或取自圣言的教义来修正。必须以这种方式来修正的原因是，真理教导何为邪恶，何为虚假，人以这种方式看见并承认它们；当他看见并承认它们时，修正就能在他里面实现，因为主流入人里面他所知道的事物，不流入他所不知道的事物。因此，在此人被教导这是邪恶或虚假之前，祂不会修正邪恶或虚假。正因如此，那些行悔改之工的人必看见并承认他们的邪恶，从而过一种真理的生活（参看<a href="8388.htm">8388</a>-<a href="8392.htm">8392</a>节）。这种情形与从爱自己爱世界的邪恶中洁净很相似。从这些爱中洁净若不通过信之真理，绝无可能实现，因为这些真理教导，一切罪恶的欲望都来源于这些爱。这解释了为何在以色列和犹太民族当中用火石刀施行割礼；因为“割礼”表示从这些污秽的爱中洁净；用来行割礼的“火石刀”表示信之真理（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>m，<a href="7044.htm">7044</a>节）。人也通过信之真理重生（<a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>，<a href="8772.htm">8772</a>节）。这一点由古时用于洁净仪式的“洗濯”来表示；也由如今洗礼的水来表示。因为“水”表示信之真理，邪恶通过这些真理被移除（<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>节），“洗礼”表示重生（<a href="4255.htm">4255</a>，<a href="5120.htm">5120</a>e节）。<br />由此明显可知，那些以为人里面的恶或罪被抹去，如同身上的污垢被水冲去一样，并且古时照教会的律例用水洗濯，以及如今通过受洗得救之人的内层都被洁净的人，其想法何等错误。而事实上，古时，洗濯仅仅代表内层的洁净；洗礼仅仅表示重生。所用的水表示一个人用来洁净和重生的信之真理，因为邪恶通过这些真理被移除。洗礼是为了那些教会里的人，因为他们拥有圣言，而信之真理就在圣言中，人则通过这些真理重生。</p>

He shall pay silver to its master. That this signifies by truth appertaining to him whose good or truth in the natural has been perverted, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth 
(see n. 1551, 2048, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 7999); of "giving silver," as being to redeem by means of truth (n. 2954); and from the signification of "its master," namely, of him whose ox or ass had 
fallen into the pit, as being the one whose good or truth in the natural has been perverted; for "an ox" denotes good in the natural, and "an ass" denotes truth there (n. 9065, 9086); and "to fall into 
a pit" denotes to pervert these (n. 9086). [2] The case herein is this. If good or truth is being perverted by means of falsity, then that which has been perverted must be amended by means of truth; 
within the church by means of truth from the Word, or from doctrine which is from the Word. The reason why this must he so, is that truth teaches what is evil and what is false, and in this way the 
man sees and acknowledges it; and when he sees and acknowledges, he can then be amended. For the Lord flows into those things in man which the man knows; but not into those things which he does not know; 
and therefore He does not amend what is evil or what is false until the man has been instructed that it is evil or false. From this it is that those who do the work of repentance must see and acknowledge 
their evils, and thus live a life of truth (see n. 8388-8392). The case is the same with purifications from the evils of the love of self and the love of the world. Purifications from these loves 
cannot possibly be effected except by means of the truths of faith, because these teach that all concupiscences are from these loves. It was for this reason that among the Israelitish and Jewish nation 
circumcision was performed by means of a knife of stone; for "circumcision" signified purification from these filthy loves; and the "knife of stone" by which it was performed signified the truth 
of faith (n. 2799, 7044). Moreover man is regenerated by means of the truths of faith (n. 8635-8640, 8772). This was signified by the "washings," whereby in olden time they were cleansed. The same is 
also signified at this day by the waters of baptism, for "waters" signify the truths of faith by means of which evils are removed (n. 739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 7307, 8568), and "baptism" signifies 
regeneration (n. 4255, 5120). [3] From all this it is evident how erroneously those think who believe that evils or sins in man are wiped away, as the impurities of the body are washed away by water, 
and that those were cleansed as to the interiors who in old time were washed with water according to the statutes of the church, and also that at the present day men are saved by being baptized; when 
yet in old time washings merely represented the cleansing of the interiors; and "baptism" signifies regeneration, the "waters" thereof denoting the truths of faith whereby man is cleansed and regenerated, 
for evils are removed by their means. Baptism is for those who are within the church, because these have the Word, in which are the truths of faith through which man is regenerated. </p>

'He shall give silver to its owner' means by means of truth with him whose good or truth in the natural has been perverted. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6112.htm">6112</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="7999.htm">7999</a>, and of 'giving silver' as redeeming by means of truth <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>; and from the meaning of 'its owner' - the owner of the ox or ass that fell into the pit - as the one whose 
good or truth in the natural has been perverted. For 'ox' is good in the natural, and 'ass' the truth there, <a href="9086.htm">9086</a>; and 'falling into a pit' means perverting them, <a href="9086.htm">9086</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation here is that 
if good or truth is perverted by falsity, then what has been perverted must be amended by means of truth, within the Church by means of truth from the Word, or from teachings drawn from the Word. 
The reason why it must be done this way is that truth teaches what evil is and what falsity is, and thereby a person sees and acknowledges them; and when he sees and acknowledges them amendment can be 
accomplished in him, since the Lord enters into those things with a person that the person knows, not into those he does not know. He does not therefore amend evil or falsity until the person has learned 
that it is evil or falsity. So it is that those who have to do the work of repentance must see and acknowledge their evils, and accordingly lead the life of truth, <a href="8388.htm">8388</a>-<a href="8392.htm">8392</a> The situation is similar 
with purification from the evils of self-love and love of the world. Purification from those loves cannot at all be accomplished except by means of the truths of faith, because these teach that all 
sinful desires spring from those loves. This explains why circumcision among the Israelite and Jewish nation was performed with a knife made of flint; for circumcision was a sign of purification from 
those foul loves, and the knife of flint with which it was performed was a sign of the truth of faith, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a> (middle), <a href="7044.htm">7044</a>. By means of the truths of faith also a person is regenerated, <a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>, <a href="8772.htm">8772</a>. 
This was meant by the washings used in former times for ritual cleansings; and the same thing is also meant at the present day by the waters of baptism. For the waters are a sign of the truths of 
faith, by means of which evils are removed, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>, <a href="8568.htm">8568</a>, and baptism is a sign of regeneration, <a href="4255.htm">4255</a>, <a href="5120.htm">5120</a> (end). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it is evident how false the thinking 
is of those who believe that a person's evils or sins are wiped away as dirt on the body is washed away by water, that the interiors of those who were washed with water in former times according to the 
rules of the Church were cleansed, and also that people at the present day are saved through undergoing baptism. In actual fact the washings in former times did no more than represent the cleansing 
of people interiorly, and baptism is only the sign of regeneration. The waters there mean the truths of faith by means of which a person is cleansed and regenerated, for by means of those truths are 
evils removed. Baptism is for those within the Church, because they have the Word, where the truths of faith, the means by which a person is regenerated, are to be found. </p>

</p><b>9088.</b>
`Argentum reddet domino ejus': quod significet quod per verum apud illum cujus bonum aut verum in naturali perversum est, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2048, 5658, 
6112, 6914, 6917, 7999, et quod `dare argentum' sit redimere per verum, n. 2954, et ex significatione `domini ejus,' nempe cujus bos vel asinus cecidit in foveam, quod sit is cujus bonum aut verum 
in naturali perversum (o)est, `bos' enim est bonum in naturali, et `asinus' est verum ibi, n. (x)9086, et `cadere in foveam' est illa pervertere, n. 9086. 	[2] Cum hoc ita se habet: si bonum aut verum 
per falsum pervertitur, tunc perversum est emendandum per verum, (o)intra Ecclesiam per verum ex Verbo, seu ex doctrina {1} quae ex Verbo; causa quod ita erit, est quia verum docet quid malum et quid 
falsum, et sic homo illa videt et agnoscit, et cum videt et agnoscit {2}, tunc emendari potest, nam Dominus influit in illa apud hominem quae homo scit, non autem in illa quae non scit; quapropter 
nec emendat malum aut falsum priusquam homo instructus est quod sit malum aut falsum; inde est quod qui paenitentiam agent, mala sua videbunt et agnoscent, et sic vitam veri vivent {3}, n. 8388-8392 {4}; 
similiter se habet cum purificationibus a malis amorum sui et mundi; purificationes ab illis `amoribus' nequaquam fieri possunt quam per vera fidei, quia haec docent quod ab amoribus illis omnes concupiscentiae 
{5}; inde erat quod (x)circumcisio apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam fiebat per cultrum petrae {6}, circumcisio enim significabat purificationem a spurcis illis amoribus, et culter petrae 
{6}, per quem fiebat, significabat verum fidei, n. (x)2799 med., 7044.  Per vera fidei etiam homo regeneratur, n. 8635-8640, 8772; hoc per lavationes, per quas olim mundabantur, significatum est, 
et idem quoque hodie per aquas baptismi; aquae enim significant vera fidei, per quae mala removentur, n. 739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 7307, 8568, et baptismus significat regenerationem, n. 4255, 5120 
fin. 	[3] Ex his patet quam false cogitant qui credunt mala seu peccata apud hominem abstergi sicut sordes (x)corporis abluuntur {7} per aquas, et {8} quod mundati fuerint quoad interiora qui secundum 
statuta Ecclesiae olim lavabantur per aquas {9}, ut et quod salventur hodie per quod baptizentur, cum tamen lavationes olim modo repraesentabant mundationem interiorum, et baptizatio significat regenerationem, 
aquae ibi sunt vera fidei per quae homo mundatur et regeneratur, nam per illa removentur mala {10}; baptismus est pro illis qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, quia his est Verbum, ubi vera fidei, 
per quae homo regeneratur. @1 i Ecclesiae$ @2 illa videt homo, et cum videt$ @3 agent$ @4 8391$ @5 quid malum et quid falsum$ @6 petrarum,$ @7 Before sordes$ @8 tum$ @9 aquis$ @10 per baptizationem
