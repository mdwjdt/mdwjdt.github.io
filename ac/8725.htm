<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8725节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8725.</strong>“摩西从以色列众人中拣选了有才能的人”表选择能在那些属于属灵教会的人当中与良善联结的真理。这从“有才能的人”的含义和“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“有才能的人”是指能与良善联结的真理（参看<a href="8710.htm">8710</a>节）；“以色列”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前所述（<a href="8645.htm">8645</a>节）。之所以说“选择能与良善联结的真理”，是因为有些真理还不能与良善联结，有些真理能与良善联结。能与良善联结的真理就是已经被证实、而且与其它许多真理相结合的真理，以及取悦心智眼目的真理。这些真理以这种方式进入情感，从而使得一个人意愿它们。当达到这一点时，良善就与这些真理相联结；因为意愿真理并由此实行真理使得这些真理成为良善。要进一步知道，在这些真理从邪恶所生的虚假当中洁净，并与必成为要重生之人的信之真理的一切真理有一种联系之前，良善不会与真理联结。天使从主那里清晰明了地看见并觉察到真理的这种联结和洁净；然而，人很少感受或察觉到发生在自己里面的这种事。</p>

And Moses chose men of strenuousness out of all Israel. That this signifies the choice of truths with which good could be conjoined among those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification 
of "men of strenuousness," as being truths with which good can be conjoined (see above, n. 8710); and from the representation of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (of 
which above, n. 8645). It is said "the choice of truths with which good can be conjoined," because there are truths with which good cannot as yet be conjoined, and truths with which it can. The truths 
with which it can be conjoined, are truths confirmed, and also consociated with many others, even with such as delight the intellectual sight; in this way these truths enter into the affection, which 
makes the man will them. When this takes place, then good conjoins itself with them; for to will truths, and from this to do them, makes them to be good. Be it known further, that good is not conjoined 
with truths until these truths have been purified from the falsities which are from evil, and until they have a connection with all the truths which must be truths of faith with him who is to be regenerated. 
From the Lord the angels clearly and plainly see and perceive the connection and purification of truths, however little the man may feel or perceive in himself anything of the kind. </p>

'And Moses chose men of vigour from all Israel' means the choice of truths to which good could be joined among those belonging to the spiritual Church This is clear from the meaning of 'men of vigour' 
as truths to which good can be joined, dealt with above in <a href="8710.htm">8710</a>; and from the representation of 'Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with above in <a href="8645.htm">8645</a>. The choice of truths to 
which good can be joined is spoken of because there are truths to which good cannot as yet be joined and there are truths to which it can be joined. The truths to which it can be joined are truths that 
have been corroborated and have in addition been linked to many others, also those that delight the eye of the mind. In this way those truths enter the affections, which cause a person to want to 
practice them. When this point is reached good joins itself to those truths, for wanting to practice truths and therefore actually doing so makes those truths into good. It should in addition be recognized 
that good is not joined to truths until those truths have been purified from falsities arising from evil, and until they have a connection with all the truths which must be incorporated into the 
faith of one who is to be regenerated. Angels have from the Lord perfectly clear vision and perception of the connection and purification of truths, however little a person may sense or discern that 
anything like this is happening inside him. </p>

`Et elegit Moscheh viros strenuitatis ab omni Israele': quod significet electionem verorum quibus bonum conjungi potuit apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, constat ex significatione `virorum strenuitatis' 
quod sint vera quibus bonum conjungi {1}potest, de qua supra n. (x)8710, et ex repraesentatione `Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua supra n. 8645.  Dicitur electio verorum 
quibus bonum conjungi potest, quia dantur vera quibus bonum nondum conjungi potest, et vera quibus potest; vera quibus potest, sunt vera confirmata, et quoque consociata pluribus, etiam talibus quae 
intellectualem visum delectant, {2} sic vera illa intrant in affectionem quae facit ut homo velit illa; cum hoc fit, tunc bonum se illis conjungit, nam velle vera et inde agere illa facit ut sint bonum; 
sciendum porro quod bonum (t)veris non prius (x)conjungatur quam cum vera illa purificata {3}sunt a falsis quae ex malo, et antequam nexum habent cum omnibus veris quae erunt fidei apud regenerandum; 
nexum et purificationem verorum vident et percipiunt angeli a Domino clare et evidenter, utcumque homo {4} nihil tale apud se sentit aut appercipit. 	@1 posset$ 	@2 i et$ 	@3 sint$ 	@4 i prorsus$ </p>
