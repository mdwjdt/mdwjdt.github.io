<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6716节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6716.</strong>“有一个来自利未家的人去”表源于良善的真理。这从“人”和“来自家”的含义，以及“利未”的代表清楚可知：“人”是指真理（参看<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>节）；“来自家”是指起源；“利未”是指良善，因为“利未”在至高意义上代表神性之爱（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>节），在内义上代表属灵之爱（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）；他因代表爱，故代表良善，因为一切良善皆来自爱。关于此处由“来自利未家的人”所表示的源于良善的真理，要知道，在下文，就至高意义而言，所论述的主题是主，即祂的人身如何变成神的律法，也就是真正的真理或真理本身。众所周知，主像其他人一样出生，当还是个小孩子时，祂就学习说话，和其他小孩子一样，之后在知识，以及聪明和智慧上成长。<br />由此明显可知，祂的人身并非生来就是神性，而是祂凭自己的能力把它变成神性。祂之所以凭自己的能力把它变成神性，是因为祂从耶和华成孕，因此其生命至内在的核心就是耶和华自己。因为每个人生命至内在的核心，也就是所谓的“灵魂”，皆源自父亲；而包裹这至内层的东西，也就是所谓的“身体”，则源自母亲。源自父亲的生命至内在的核心不断流入，并作用于源自母亲的外在，甚至在子宫里就努力使这外在像它自己。这一点可从以下事实看出来：孩子生来就具有父亲的性情，有时孙子和曾孙具有祖父和曾祖父的性情。其原因在于，源自父亲的灵魂不断想使源自母亲的外在成为它自己的形像和样式。<br />这是人的情况，由此可见，主尤其如此。祂的至内在部分就是神性本身，因为它是耶和华自己；事实上，祂是耶和华的独生子。由于这至内在部分是神性本身，所以神性岂不比任何人更能使源自母亲的外在成为自己的形像，也就是类似它自己，以使得人身（即源自母亲的外在）变成神性？祂凭自己的能力实现这一切，因为神性，就是祂作用于祂的人身所凭借的至内层，属于祂，正如一个人的灵魂，就是他的至内在部分，属于这个人一样。由于主照着神序发展，所以祂在世时将祂的人身变成神性真理；但后来，当完全得着荣耀时，祂便把它变成了神性良善，从而与耶和华为一。<br />本章在至高意义上就描述了这一切是如何成就的。不过，由于全都在论述主的至高意义的内容超越了人类的理解力，所以我会在下文解释包含在本章内义中的事物。这些论述了与教会成员，也就是正在重生的人同在的神性之真理的开始和相继状态（参看<a href="6713.htm">6713</a>，<a href="6714.htm">6714</a>节）。这些事物之所以包含在内义中，是因为人的重生就是主之人身体荣耀的一个形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3245.htm">3245</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。</p>

And there went a man from the house of Levi. That this signifies the origin of truth from good, is evident from the signification of "a man," as being truth (see n. 3134); and from the signification 
of "from the house," as being the origin; and from the representation of Levi, as being good; for Levi in the supreme sense represents the Divine love (n. 3875), and in the internal sense spiritual love 
(n. 3875, 4497, 4502, 4503); and because he represents love, he represents good, for all good is of love. As regards the origin of truth from good, which is here signified by "a man from the house 
of Levi," be it known that in what follows, in the supreme sense, the subject treated of is the Lord, how as to His Human He became the law Divine, that is, truth itself. It is known that the Lord was 
born as are other men, and that when a child He learned to speak like other children, and that He then grew in knowledge, and also in intelligence, and in wisdom. [2] From this it is evident that His 
Human was not Divine from birth, but that He made it Divine by His own power. That He did this by His own power was because He was conceived of Jehovah, and hence the inmost of His life was Jehovah 
Himself; for the inmost of the life of every man, which is called the "soul," is from the father; but what this inmost puts on, which is called the "body," is from the mother. That the inmost of life, 
which is from the father, is continually flowing and working into the external, which is from the mother, and is in the effort to make this like itself, even in the womb, can be seen from sons, in that 
they are born into the disposition of the father, and sometimes grandsons and great-grandsons into that of the grandfather and great grandfather. The reason of this is that the soul, which is from 
the father, continually wills to make the external, which is from the mother, a likeness and image of itself.  [3] This being the case with man, it can be seen that it was especially so with the Lord. 
His inmost was the Divine Itself, because it was Jehovah Himself, for He was His only-begotten Son; and because the inmost was the Divine Itself, was not this, more than in any man, able to make the 
external, which is from the mother, an image of itself, that is, like itself? thus making the Human, which was external and from the mother, Divine; and this by His own power, because the Divine, which 
was inmost, from which He worked into the Human, was His, as the soul of man, which is the inmost, is man's. And as the Lord advanced according to Divine order, He made His Human, when He  was in the 
world, Divine truth; but afterward, when He was fully glorified, He made it Divine good, thus one with Jehovah. [4] How this was done is described in this chapter in the supreme sense, but as the 
things contained in the supreme sense, all of which treat of the Lord, surpass human understanding, I may in what follows set forth the things contained in this chapter in the internal sense. These treat 
of the beginning and successive states of truth Divine with the man of the church, that is, with the man who is being regenerated (see n. 6713, 6714). The reason why these things are contained in 
the internal sense, is that the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification of the Lord's Human (n. 3138, 3212, 3245, 3246, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688). </p>

'A man from the house of Levi went' means truth which has its origin in good. This is clear from the meaning of 'a man as truth, dealt with in <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>; from the meaning of being 'from the house' as the 
origin; and from the representation of 'Levi' as good. In the highest sense 'Levi' represents Divine Love, dealt with in <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, and in the internal sense spiritual love, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>, <a href="4502.htm">4502</a>, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>; and since 
he represents love, he represents good, because all good comes from love. As regards truth which has its origin in good, meant here by 'a man from the house of Levi', it should be recognized that the 
verses which follow deal in the highest sense with the Lord, with the way in which His Human became the law of God, that is, real Truth. It is well known that the Lord was born like anyone else and 
that when He was a young child he learned to talk like any other young child, after which He grew in knowledge, and also in intelligence and wisdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it is evident that His Human was 
not Divine when He was born but that He made it Divine by His own power. He made it Divine by His own power because He had been conceived from Jehovah, as a result of which the inmost core of His life 
was Jehovah Himself. For the inmost core of anyone's life, called the soul, is derived from the father, whereas that which clothes what is inmost, called the body, is derived from the mother. The inmost 
core of life derived from the father is constantly flowing into and having an effect on the external derived from the mother, endeavouring even in the womb to make it similar to itself. This may be 
recognized in the fact that children are born with their father's disposition, and sometimes grandchildren and great grandchildren with their grandfather's and great grandfather's disposition. The reason 
for this is that the soul, which is derived from the father, constantly wishes to make the external derived from the mother similar to itself and an image of itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Seeing that this is what 
goes on with man, one may recognize that it was what went on especially with the Lord. The inmost part of Him was the Divine Itself because it was Jehovah Himself, for He was Jehovah's only-begotten 
Son. And since that inmost part was the Divine Itself, how, more so than with any man, could the Divine fail to make the external derived from the mother an image of itself, that is, similar to itself, 
so that the Human - the external, derived from the mother - would be made Divine? This He accomplished by His own power because the Divine, which was the Inmost by which He had an effect on His Human, 
was His in the same way as a person's soul, which is the inmost part of him, belongs to that person. And because the progress which the Lord made conformed to Divine order, He made His Human, while 
He was in the world, to be Divine Truth; but after that, when He was fully glorified, He made it to be Divine Good, and so one with Jehovah.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 How this was accomplished is what is described 
in the highest sense of the present chapter. But since the contents of the highest sense, which all have to do with the Lord, surpass human understanding, let what follows be an explanation of the things 
contained in the internal sense of the chapter. These have to do with the beginnings and the succeeding states of God's truth with a member of the Church, that is, with a person who is being regenerated, <a href="6713.htm">6713</a>, <a href="6714.htm">6714</a>. The reason why these are the things contained in the internal sense is that human regeneration is an image of the glorification of the Lord's Human, see <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3245.htm">3245</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>,

`Ivit vir e domo Levi': quod significet originem veri ex bono, constat ex significatione `viri' quod sit verum, de qua n. 3134; ex significatione `esse e domo' quod sit origo; et ex repraesentatione 
`Levi' quod sit bonum, `Levi' enim in supremo sensu repraesentat Divinum Amorem, de qua n. 3875; et in sensu interno amorem spiritualem, n. 3875, 4497, 4502, 4503; et quia amorem, repraesentat bonum, 
nam omne bonum est amoris.  Quod attinet originem veri ex bono, quae hic per `virum e domo Levi' significatur, sciendum quod in sequentibus in supremo sensu agatur de Domino quomodo Ipse quoad Humanum 
Suum factus {1}est lex Divina, hoc est, Ipsum Verum: notum est quod Dominus natus sit sicut alius homo, et quod cum infans, didicerit loqui sicut alius infans, et quod dein creverit 2 scientia, tum 
intelligentia et sapientia; inde patet quod Humanum Ipsius non fuerit Divinum a nativitate, sed quod Ipse illud ex propria potentia Divinum fecerit.  Quod ex propria potentia, erat quia conceptus fuit 
a Jehovah, inde erat intimum vitae Ipsius Ipse Jehovah; nam intimum vitae cujusvis hominis, quod anima vocatur, est a patre, quod autem induit illud intimum, quod corpus dicitur, est a matre; quod intimum 
vitae quod a patre, continue influat et operetur in externum quod a matre, et conitatur hoc sibi simile facere, etiam in utero, constare potest ex filiis quod nascantur in indolem patris, et quandoque 
nepotes et pronepotes in indolem avi et atavi; hoc inde est quia anima, quae est a patre, continue vult externum, quod a matre, sibi simile et sui imaginem facere. 	3 Cum ita apud hominem fit, 
constare potest quod ita imprimis apud Dominum factum; intimum Ipsius fuit Ipsum Divinum quia Ipse Jehovah, nam Ipsius Unigenitus Filius fuit; et quia Intimum fuit Ipsum Divinum, annon Hoc, (x)plus quam 
apud omnem hominem, potuit externum, quod a matre, sui imaginem, hoc est, sibi simile facere, ita Humanum, quod {2}externum et a matre, Divinum; et hoc ex propria potentia, quia Divinum, quod Intimum, 
ex Quo operatus est in Humanum, fuit Ipsius; sicut anima hominis, quae est intimum, est ejus; et quia Dominus progressus est secundum ordinem Divinum, Humanum Suum, cum erat in mundo, fecit ut esset 
Divinum Verum, postmodum autem, cum plene glorificatus est, fecit ut esset Divinum Bonum, ita unum cum Jehovah. 	4 Quomodo hoc factum {3}est, in hoc capite in supremo sensu describitur; sed quia

incohamentis et successivis statibus apud hominem Ecclesiae, hoc est, apud hominem qui regeneratur, n. 6713, 6714; causa quod ea in sensu interno contineantur, est quia regeneratio hominis est imago
