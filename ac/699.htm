<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第699节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>699．为了亲眼目睹地狱里的那些人所遭受的痛苦，和低地上的那些人所经历的消磨，我好几次被下放到那里。被下放到地狱不是从一个地方被带到另一个地方，而是被下放到某个地狱社群，并且只能呆在这个地方。我在此讲述一个经历：我清楚地发觉有一个圆柱围住了我，这个圆柱明显加厚，然后我得到一个暗示：这就是圣言中提及的“铜墙”。这个圆柱是由天使灵形成的，以便我能安全地降到不幸的人那里。当我到达那里时，只听见痛苦的哀号声，特别是这些话：“神啊！神啊！可怜可怜我们吧！可怜可怜我们吧！”这哀号持续了很长时间。我还得以与这些不幸的人交谈，并且谈论了很长时间。他们尤其抱怨恶灵只渴望和急于折磨他们，并绝望地说，他们觉得这种折磨会永远持续下去。不过，我获许安慰了他们。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]699.</strong> I have been sent down to hell several times in order to see the torture that those in hell go through and the devastation of those in the underground realm. (Being sent to hell is not a matter of moving from one place to another but of gaining entrance to one of hell's communities while staying in the same place.) Let me report on just one experience.<br />I had the clear sensation of a kind of pillar drawing around me and growing perceptibly larger. The idea came to me that this was the bronze wall mentioned in the Word, formed out of angelic spirits to keep me safe in my mission to the unfortunates below.{*1} While there, I heard plaintive wails like these: "Oh God, oh God! Have mercy on us! Have mercy on us!" These laments continued for a long time. I was allowed to talk with those unhappy people as much as I wanted. Their main complaint concerned the evil spirits, whose sole and burning desire was to cause them pain. They had lost hope, saying that they believed the agony would go on to eternity. But I was able to comfort them.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is referring here to the bronze wall mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_699/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_1_18" target=_top>Jeremiah 1:18</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_699/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_15_20" target=_top>15:20</a>.

That I might witness the torment of those who are in hell, and the vastation of those who are in the lower earth, I have at different times been let down thither. To be let down into hell is not to be 
carried from one place to another, but to be let into some infernal society, the man remaining in the same place. But I may here relate only this experience: I plainly perceived that a kind of column 
surrounded me, and this column was sensibly increased, and it was intimated to me that this was the "wall of brass" spoken of in the Word.* The column was formed of angelic spirits in order that I might 
safely descend to the unhappy. When I was there I heard piteous lamentations, such as, O God! O God! take pity on us! take pity on us! and this for a long time. I was permitted to speak to those 
wretched ones, and this for a considerable time. They complained especially of evil spirits in that they desired and burned for nothing else than to torment them. They were in despair, saying that they 
believed their torment would be eternal; but I was permitted to comfort them. *  Jer. 1:18; 15:20. </p>

To witness the torment of those who are in hell, and also the vastation of those who are on the lower earth, I have several times been sent down there. (Being sent down into hell does not involve being 
taken from one place to another; it involves being admitted into some community of hell and yet remaining just where you are.) Let this one experience be described here: I once perceived clearly that 
a sort of column was surrounding me. This column grew noticeably thicker. Then it was instilled into me that this was 'the wall of bronze' mentioned in the Word,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and that it consisted of angelic spirits, 
so that I could be sent down to the unfortunate and yet remain unharmed. While I was there I heard miserable wailings, in particular these, 'O God, O God, have mercy on us, have mercy on us and 
this went on for a long time. I was also allowed to talk to those wretches, and to do so quite a lot. Most of all they moaned about evil spirits longing and burning to do nothing else but torment them. 
In their despair they said they were convinced that the torment would last for ever. But I was allowed to comfort them.

</p><b>699.</b>
Ut viderem cruciatum eorum qui in inferno, tum vastationem eorum qui in terra inferiore, aliquoties illuc demissus (demitti in infernum non est transferri e loco in locum, sed est immissio in aliquam 
infernalem societatem, manente homine in eodem loco); sed hanc solum experientiam hic licet referre: percipiebam manifeste quod quasi columna quaedam me circumdaret; columna illa sensibiliter augebatur; 
et insinuabatur quod haec esset 'murus{1} aheneus,' de quo in Verbo, ex spiritibus angelicis formatus, ut tutus demitti possem ad infelices; cum ibi eram, audiebam lamentationes miserabiles, et quidem 
has, 'Ah Deus, ah Deus, misereatur nostri, misereatur nostri,' et hoc diu; concedebatur etiam cum miseris illis loqui, et satis multum; imprimis conquesti sunt de malis spiritibus, quod non aliud 
cuperent et flagrarent quam eos cruciare; in desperatione erant, dicentes quod crederent aeternum fore cruciatum; sed eos consolari datum. 	@1 e.g. Jer. xv 20. Dabo te populo huic in murum aeris munitum.$ </p>
