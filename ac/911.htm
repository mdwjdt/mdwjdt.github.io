<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第911节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>911.</strong>“一切爬在地上的爬行物”表外在人中类似性质的相应事物，重生之人的外在事物与内在事物相对应，即与它们一致，并顺从之。人在重生时，外在事物会变得顺从，此时他成为天堂的形像。但在他重生之前，外在事物主导内在事物，在此期间，他是地狱的形像。秩序在于，首先属天之物当主导属灵之物，然后通过属灵之物主导属世之物，最后通过属世之物主导肉体之物。但当肉体和属世之物主导属灵和属天之物时，秩序就遭到了破坏，然后人成为地狱的形像，因此主通过重生恢复秩序；一旦秩序得到恢复，人就成为天堂的形像。主就这样把人从地狱中提出来，并将其举升天堂。<br />至于外在人与内在人的对应关系，现简要解释如下：每个重生之人就是一个微型天堂，他是整个天堂的一个缩影或形像，这也是为何在圣言中，其内在人被称为“天堂”的原因。天堂的秩序乃是这样：主通过属天之物掌管属灵之物，通过属灵之物掌管属世之物，祂以这种方式掌管整个天堂，如同掌管一个人。为此，天堂被称为“大人”，而且天堂里的每个人都有类似秩序。人也一样，他同样是一个微型天堂，换句话说，他就是主的国，因为主的国在他里面。这时，他里面的外在事物对应于内在事物，也就是说，它们顺从内在事物，如它们在天堂的情形。因为天堂有三层，它们彼此关联，如同一个人，其中精灵构成外在人，天使灵构成内在人，而天使则构成至内在的人（<a href="459.htm">459</a>节）。<br />人若使生命仅存在于肉体之物，即身体的情欲、乐趣、欲望和感觉中，也就是说，只以迎合我欲和物欲为乐，仇恨凡不支持、不服务于他们的人，情形则完全相反。对这类人而言，由于肉体和属世之物掌管属灵和属天之物，所以外在事物不但不对应或顺从，而且还完全相反，使得秩序彻底遭到破坏。由于秩序就这样遭到破坏，所以他们必是地狱的形像。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]911.</strong>{*1} This is how it happens that a creeping thing creeping symbolizes the corresponding attributes in their outer self: In a person reborn, external traits respond to internal values, which is to say that they are obedient to them. Our outward aspects are reduced to obedience when we regenerate, and then we become an image of heaven. But until we have been reborn, external considerations overpower spiritual and heavenly ones, and then we are an image of hell.<br />The proper order is for heavenly concerns to govern spiritual ones and through these to govern earthly ones and through these, finally, to govern bodily ones. But when bodily and earthly demands control spiritual and heavenly ones, the hierarchy is destroyed, and when it is destroyed, we are an image of hell. For this reason, the Lord restores the proper order through regeneration. Once it has been restored, we become an image of heaven. This is the way the Lord draws us out of hell, and this is the way he lifts us up to heaven.<br />[2] Let me explain briefly how the correspondence of the outer self with the inner then stands. Everyone who has regenerated is a kind of miniature heaven, or a model or image of the whole of heaven — which is why the Word also calls our inner being a heaven.{*2} Things in heaven are structured in such a way that the Lord governs spiritual elements through heavenly ones and earthly elements through spiritual ones. So he governs all of heaven as a single individual, and heaven accordingly is also called the "universal human." The scheme is the same for every person within heaven. When we reflect this hierarchy, we are each a miniature heaven or, to put it another way, a kingdom of the Lord, since we have the Lord's kingdom inside us. Then external traits correspond to — that is, they obey — internal values in us just as they do in heaven. In the three heavens, which together present the image of a single person, spirits form the outer self, angelic spirits an intermediate self, and angels the inner self (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_911/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a>).<br />[3] The case is the opposite for those who locate life exclusively in bodily desires, or in other words, in cravings, physical pleasures, appetites, and indulgence of the senses. These are people who find nothing enjoyable unless it feeds their love for themselves and for worldly advantages, which is the same as feeding their hatred toward anyone who does not cater to and serve them. Because these people's bodily and earthly drives take precedence over spiritual and heavenly ones, not only do their outward attributes fail to correspond or obey, they even put up total opposition. The proper hierarchy is utterly destroyed, and since it is utterly destroyed, those people can only be images of hell.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} There is no 910. Elliott (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999; 1:358) suggests, "Possibly a section which refers to beasts meaning things of the will has been accidentally omitted." [LHC]<br />{*2} This is perhaps a reference to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_911/bible_king-james-version_luke_17_21" target=_top>Luke 17:21</a>: "The kingdom of God is within you."

As to "the creeping thing that creeps" signifying like corresponding things in the external man, the case is this. In the regenerated man external things correspond to internal things, that is, do their 
bidding. External things are reduced to obedience when man is being regenerated, and he then becomes an image of heaven. But before man has been regenerated, external things rule over internal, and 
he is then an image of hell. Order consists in celestial things ruling over spiritual things, through these over natural things, and through these over corporeal things; but when corporeal and natural 
things rule over spiritual and celestial things, order is destroyed, and then the man is an image of hell; and therefore the Lord restores order by means of regeneration, and then the man becomes an 
image of heaven. Thus does the Lord draw a man out of hell, and thus does He uplift him to heaven.  [2] A few words shall be said about the correspondence of the external man to the internal. Every 
regenerated man is a kind of little heaven, that is, he is an effigy or image of the universal heaven, and therefore in the Word his internal man is called "heaven." There is such order in heaven that 
the Lord rules spiritual things through celestial things, and natural things through spiritual things, and in this way He rules the universal heaven as one man, for which reason heaven is called the 
Grand Man and there is the like order in everyone who is in heaven. Man too, when like this, is a little heaven, or, what is the same, he is a kingdom of the Lord, because the kingdom of the Lord is 
in him; and then in him external things correspond to internal, that is, they obey them, just as they do in heaven; for in the heavens (which are three, and all of which together stand related as one 
man) spirits constitute the external man, angelic spirits the interior man, and angels the internal man (n. 459). [3] It is the reverse with those who make life consist solely in corporeal things, that 
is, in cupidities, pleasures, appetites, and matters of sense, perceiving no delight other than that which is of the love of self and of the world, that is to say, which is of hatred against all who 
do not favor and serve them. With such, because corporeal and natural things rule over spiritual and celestial things, there is not only no correspondence or obedience of external things, but the very 
reverse, and thus order is utterly destroyed; and because order is so destroyed, they cannot be other than images of hell. </p>

<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> As regards 'creeping thing that creeps' meaning corresponding things of a like nature residing with his external man, with a regenerate person external things correspond to internal, that is, they are 
conformable and subservient to them. External things are rendered subservient when a person is being regenerated, at which point he becomes an image of heaven. But before he has been regenerated external 
things have dominion over internal; and during that time he is an image of hell. Order entails celestial things governing spiritual things first, then natural things by means of spiritual, and 
lastly bodily things by means of natural. But when bodily and natural things have dominion over spiritual and celestial, order is destroyed. Once order is destroyed, man is an image of hell, and therefore 
through regeneration the Lord brings about the restoration of order; and once this has been restored a man becomes an image of heaven. In this way the Lord draws a person out of hell and bears him 
up to heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To make known the way in which the external man corresponds to the internal, let a brief explanation be given. Every regenerate person is a miniature heaven, that is, a replica 
or image of the whole of heaven, which also is why in the Word his internal man is called heaven. In heaven order is such that the Lord governs spiritual things by means of celestial, and natural things 
by means of spiritual. In this manner He governs the whole of heaven as one human being, and therefore heaven is called the Grand Man. Furthermore this same order exists with every individual in heaven. 
And when the same applies to man too, he likewise is a miniature heaven, or what amounts to the same, is the Lord's kingdom, for the Lord's kingdom is within him. In his case external things correspond 
to internal, that is to say, they are obedient to them, just as they are in heaven. For there are three heavens which are interrelated as one man - spirits constitute the external man, angelic 
spirits the interior, and angels the inmost, <a href="459.htm">459</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is quite the reverse with people who make life consist solely in bodily things, that is, in the desires, pleasures, appetites, and sensations 
of the body; with people, that is, who take no delight in anything other than that which accompanies self-love and love of the world, that is, which goes with hatred towards everyone who shows them 
no favour and does not serve them. Because with these people bodily and natural things have dominion over spiritual and celestial, not only is there no correspondence or obedience on the part of external 
things, but the total reverse exists, so that order is completely destroyed. And because order is thus destroyed they cannot be anything other than images of hell.

{1}  Quod 'reptile repens' significet similia correspondentia apud externum ejus hominem, ita se habet: apud regeneratum hominem correspondent externa internis, hoc est, obsequia praestant; externa ad 
obsequium rediguntur cum homo regeneratur, et tunc fit imago caeli; sed antequam regeneratus est, externa dominantur super interna, et tunc est imago inferni: ordo est ut caelestia regant spiritualia 
et per haec naturalia et demum per haec corporea; at cum corporea et naturalia dominatur super spiritualia et caelestia, est ordo destructus; cum ordo destructus est, est imago inferni, quare a Domino 
per regenerationem ordo restituitur, et cum restitutus est, fit imago caeli; ita homo Domino extrahitur ab inferno; et ita attollitur ad caelum; [2] ut sciatur quomodo tunc correspondentia externi 
hominis ad internum se habeat paucis licet exponere; unusquisque homo regeneratus est exiguum quoddam caelum, seu effigies aut imago universi caeli, quare etiam in Verbo internus ejus homo vocatur caelum; 
in caelo talis ordo est quod Dominus per caelestia regat spiritualia et per haec naturalia, et si universum caelum sicut unum hominem, quare etiam caelum Maximus Homo vocatur; talis ordo quoque est 
apud unumquemvis qui in caeli est; cum talis etiam homo, tunc similiter est exiguum caelum, seu quod idem est, est regnum Domini, quia in eo est regnum Domini tunc apud eum correspondent similiter 
ac in caelo externa internis hoc est, oboediunt; nam in caelis, qui tres sunt et unum hominem simul referunt, spiritus constituant externum hominem, spiritus angelici interiorem, angeli internum, n. 459. 
 [3] Contrarium est apud eo qui solam vitam in corporeis, hoc est, in cupiditatibus, voluptatibus appetitibus et sensualibus ponunt, hoc est, qui nihil jucundum percipiunt quam quod est amoris sui 
et mundi, quod idem est ac quod est odiorum contra omnes qui sibi non favent et serviunt; apud hos quia corporea et naturalia dominantur super spiritualia et caelestia, non solum nulla correspondentia 
aut oboedientia externorum est, sed prorsus contrarium, et ita plane destructus ordo, et quia ita destructus ordo, non possunt aliter esse quam imagines inferni. 	@1 There is no n. 910 in I.$ </p>
