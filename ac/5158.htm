Verses 20-23. And it came to pass on the third day, on Pharaoh's birthday, and he made a feast to all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the prince of the butlers and the head of the prince of 
the bakers in the midst of his servants. And he brought back the prince of the butlers upon his butlership, and he gave the cup upon Pharaoh's palm; and he hanged the prince of the bakers; as Joseph 
interpreted to them. And the prince of the butlers did not remember Joseph, and he forgot him. "And it came to pass on the third day," signifies in the last; "on Pharaoh's birthday," signifies when the 
natural was being regenerated; "and he made a feast to all his servants," signifies initiation and conjunction with the exterior natural; "and he lifted up the head," signifies according to what was 
provided and foreseen; "of the prince of the butlers and the head of the prince of the bakers," signifies concerning the sensuous things subject to both parts, the intellectual part and the will part; 
"in the midst of his servants," signifies which were among those things that were in the exterior natural; "and he brought back the prince of the butlers upon his butlership," signifies that the sensuous 
things of the intellectual part were received and made subordinate; "and he gave the cup upon Pharaoh's palm," signifies instrumental to the interior natural; "and he hanged the prince of the bakers," 
signifies that the sensuous things of the will part were rejected; "as Joseph interpreted to them," signifies prediction from the celestial in the natural; "and the prince of the butlers did not 
remember Joseph," signifies that there was not as yet conjunction in every way with the celestial of the natural; "and he forgot him," signifies removal. </p>

Verses 20-23 And it happened on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers, and the head of the chief of the 
bakers, in the midst of his servants. And he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his supervision over [Pharaoh's] drink, and he put the cup onto Pharaoh's palm. And the chief of the bakers he hanged, 
as Joseph had interpreted to them. And the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph, and forgot him. </p>
<p>'And it happened on the third day' means in the final phase. 'Pharaoh's birthday' means 
when the natural was to be regenerated. 'That he made a feast for all his servants' means the introduction and joining to the exterior natural. 'And he lifted up the head' means according to what 
was of providence and what was of foresight. 'Of the chief of the cupbearers, and the head of the chief of the bakers' means the sensory powers subject to both parts, the understanding part and the will 
part. 'In the midst of his servants' means which were among the things present in the exterior natural. 'And he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his supervision over [Pharaoh's] drink' means 
that the sensory impressions belonging to the understanding part were accepted and made subordinate. 'And he put the cup onto Pharaoh's palm means and subservient to the interior natural. 'And the chief 
of the bakers he hanged' means that the sensory impressions belonging to the will part were cast aside. 'As Joseph had interpreted to them' means as foretold by the celestial within the natural. 
'And the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph' means that a complete joining to the celestial of the natural did not as yet exist. 'And forgot him' means removal. </p>

Vers. 20-23.  Et factum in die tertio, die nasci Pharaonis, et fecit convivium omnibus servis suis, et extulit caput principis pincernarum, et caput principis pistorum, in medio servorum suorum. Et 
reduxit principem pincernarum super propinationem suam, et dedit scyphum super volam Pharaonis. Et principem pistorum suspendit, quemadmodum interpretatus illis Joseph. Et non recordatus princeps pincernarum 
Josephi, et oblitus ejus. `Et factum in die tertio' significat in ultimo: `die nasci Pharaonis' significat cum regeneraretur naturale: `et fecit convivium omnibus servis suis' significat 
initiationem et conjunctionem cum exteriore naturali: </p>
<p>`et extulit caput' significat secundum provisum et praevisum: </p>
<p>`principis pincernarum et caput principis pistorum significat de sensualibus 
utrique parti, intellectualis et voluntariae, subjectis: `in medio servorum suorum' significat quae inter illa quae in exteriore naturali; `et reduxit principem pincernarum super propinationem suam' 
significat quod sensualia partis intellectualis recepta et subordinata sint: `et dedit scyphum super volam Pharaonis' significat et inservientia interiori naturali: `et principem pistorum suspendit' 
significat quod sensualia partis voluntariae rejecta: `quemadmodum interpretatus illis Joseph' significat praedictionem a caelesti in naturali: et non recordatus princeps pincernarum Josephi' significat 
quod nondum omnimoda conjunctio cum caelesti naturalis: `et oblitus ejus' significat remotionem. </p>
