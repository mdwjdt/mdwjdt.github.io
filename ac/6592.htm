<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6592节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6592.</strong>“你们要使我的骸骨从这里上去”表将会有一个教会的代表，而非一个也存在于内在层面的代表性教会。这从“约瑟”的代表清楚可知，“约瑟”是指教会的内在（参看<a href="6587.htm">6587</a>节）；由于他代表教会的内在，所以他的“骸骨”表示教会最外在或最外层的事物，因而表示形成它的代表部分的东西。因为曾存在于古教会，也设立在雅各后代当中的代表行为构成教会的最外层；而他们所表之物代表教会的内在。这些内在由含有灵在里面“血肉或血气”来表示；而最外层由“骨”来表示。由此可见教会仅处于外在，没有内在时是何性质，即：它就像一个人没有血肉的骨架。以色列和犹太人中间没有教会，只有一个教会的代表（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4500.htm">4500</a>，<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>，<a href="4844.htm">4844</a>，<a href="4847.htm">4847</a>，<a href="4903.htm">4903</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>节）；一个教会的代表没有在他们中间设立，直到他们内在完全荒凉；否则，他们只会亵渎神圣事物（<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>节）。</p>

And ye shall make my bones go up from hence. That this signifies that there shall be the representative of a church, but not a church, which must be in the internal also, is evident from the representation 
of Joseph, as being the internal of the church (see n. 6587); and as by him is represented the internal of the church, by his "bones" is signified that which is most external, or the ultimate of 
the church, thus the representative thereof. For the representatives that had been in the Ancient Church, and were also instituted with the descendants of Jacob, were the ultimates of the church; but 
what they signified and represented were the internals of the church. These internals are signified by "flesh in which is spirit," but the ultimates by "bones." Hence it is evident what is the quality 
of the church when it is only in externals without internals, namely, that it is like the bony structure of a man without flesh. (That with the Israelitish and Jewish people there was no church, but 
only the representative of a church, see n. 4281, 4288, 4307, 4500, 4680, 4844, 4847, 4903, 6304; and that the representative of a church was not instituted with them until after they had been completely 
vastated as to the internal; and that otherwise they would have profaned holy things, n. 4289.) </p>

'And you shall cause my bones to go up from here' means that there will be a representative of the Church but not a Church which also exists on an internal level. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Joseph' as the internal of the Church, dealt with above in <a href="6587.htm">6587</a>; and since he represents the internal of the Church, that which is the most external or the outermost area of the Church, thus that 
which forms the representative part of it, is meant by his 'bones'. For the representative acts which existed in the Ancient Church and which were also established among the descendants of Jacob constituted 
outermost forms within the Church; but the things those acts meant and represented were the inner realities of the Church. These - the inner realities - are meant by 'the flesh' which holds the 
spirit within it; but the outer forms are meant by 'the bones'. From this one may see what the Church is like when it is concerned solely with outer forms, without their inner realities, namely like 
the bones forming the framework of a person's body without the flesh. As regards the fact that no Church, only a representative of the Church existed among the Israelite and Jewish people, see <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4500.htm">4500</a>, <a href="4680.htm">4680</a>, <a href="4844.htm">4844</a>, <a href="4847.htm">4847</a>, <a href="4903.htm">4903</a>, <a href="6704.htm">6704</a>; and a representative of the Church was not established among them until they had been completely vastated internally, or else they would have rendered 
holy things profane,<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>. </p>

`Et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc':  quod significet quod repraesentativum Ecclesiae erit, non Ecclesia quae etiam in interno, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit internum Ecclesiae, 
de qua supra n. 6587; et quia per illum repraesentatur internum Ecclesiae, per `ossa ejus' significatur id quod est maxime externum seu ultimum Ecclesiae, {1} ita repraesentativum ejus; nam repraesentativa 
quae fuerunt in Ecclesia Antiqua, et quoque quae instituta apud posteros Jacobi, erant Ecclesiae {2} ultima, at quae significabant et repraesentabant, erant {3}Ecclesiae interna; haec, nempe interna, 
significantur per `carnem' in qua spiritus, at illa per `ossa'; inde constare potest qualis Ecclesia est, cum solum est in externis absque internis, quod nempe sit sicut ossea hominis compages 
absque carne.  Quod apud populum Israeliticum et Judaicum non fuerit Ecclesia sed modo Ecclesiae repraesentativum, videatur n. 4281, 4288, 4307, 4500, 4680, 4844, 4847, 4903, 6304; et quod repraesentativum 
Ecclesiae apud illos non prius institutum fuerit quam postquam prorsus quoad internum vastati fuerint, et quod alioquin profanavissent sancta, n. 4289. @1 i et$ @2 i externa ita$ @3 interiora
