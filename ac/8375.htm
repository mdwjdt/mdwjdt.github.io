<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8375节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8375.</strong>那些生活在温暖地带的人除了腰臀部有遮盖之外，都赤身裸体；他们不以赤身露体为耻，因为他们的心灵是贞洁的，他们只爱自己的配偶，憎恶通奸。令他们非常惊讶的是，我们地球灵在看见他们这样走路，并且赤身裸体时，竟嘲笑他们，还有猥亵的想法，却不关注与他们的天上生活有关的任何事，只对这类细节感兴趣。他们说，这是一个迹象，表明这些灵人关心身体和地上的事物胜过天上的事物，脑子里塞满了不得体的想法。他们被告知，对那些在一种纯真的状态下过着贞洁生活的人来说，赤身裸体既不是羞耻，也不是丑闻，只对那些生活猥亵、淫秽的人来说才是。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8375</b></p><p><b>8375.</b>
They who live in their warm zones go naked, but with a covering round the loins; nor are they ashamed of their nakedness, for their minds are chaste; and they love none except their consorts, and abhor 
adulteries. They were very much surprised that when the spirits of our earth saw them walking in this way, and likewise naked, they ridiculed them, and also had lascivious thoughts; and that they paid 
no attention whatever to their celestial life; but only to such things. They said that this is a sign that they care more for bodily and earthly things than for heavenly ones; and that indecencies 
possess their minds. They were told that nakedness does not cause either shame or scandal to those who live in chastity, and in a state of innocence; but only to those who live in lasciviousness and 
shamelessness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8375</b></p><p><b>8375.</b>
Those who live in the hot parts of their planet go naked, except for a garment round their hips. And they are not embarrassed by nakedness, since they are pure in mind, loving only their married partner 
and detesting adultery. They were utterly amazed that when spirits belonging to our planet saw them walking in their particular manner, and also naked, they should mock them and also have lewd thoughts, 
paying no attention whatever to their heavenly life, only to those kinds of details. They said it was a sign that these spirits were more interested in bodily and earthly things than heavenly ones, 
and that improper thoughts filled their minds. They were told that nakedness was neither shameful nor offensive to those who led pure lives in a state of innocence only to those whose lives were 
lewd and wanton. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8375</b>
</p><b>8375.</b>
Qui in zonis illorum calidis vivunt nudi vadunt, usque tamen cum velamine circum lumbos, nec erubescunt nuditatem, nam mentes (c)illorum castae sunt, nec amant nisi conjuges, et adulteria abhorrent. 
 Maxime mirati sunt quod spiritus nostrae telluris, cum viderent illos ita ambulantes, et quoque nudos, illos subsannarent, et quoque cogitarent lascive, et quod prorsus nihil attenderint ad vitam (c)illorum 
caelestem, sed modo ad talia; dicebant quod hoc signum sit quod corporea et terrestria prae caelestibus illis curae sint, et quod indecentia occupent mentes.  Dictum est illis quod nuditas non 
pudori sit nec scandalo illis qui in castitate et statu innocentiae vivunt, sed quod illis qui in lascivia et impudicitia. </p>
