<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7124节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7124.</strong>“百姓的督工和他们的官长出来”表那些最近距离地进行侵扰之人和那些最近距离地接受之人的派出和出现。这从“出来”、“督工”和“官长”的含义清楚可知。“出来”是指派出，因为“督工”所表示的人被派出，是为了作为交流的渠道或手段，这从前面所述（<a href="7111.htm">7111</a>节）可以看出来；此外，“出来”或“出去”也表示以一种适合别人的形式让自己出现在别人面前（参看<a href="5337.htm">5337</a>节），因而也表示出现；“督工”是指那些最近距离地进行侵扰之人；“官长”是指那些最近距离地接受和传递侵扰之人（<a href="7111.htm">7111</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7124</b></p><p><b>7124.</b>
And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers. That this signifies the sending forth and presence of those who most closely infest, and of those who most closely receive, is evident 
from the signification of "going out," as being a sending forth, because they who are signified by "taskmasters" are sent forth in order to serve as a means of communication, as can be seen from what 
was said above (n. 7111); moreover, that "to go out" denotes to present oneself before another in a form accommodated to him, see n. 5337; therefore it also denotes presence; from the signification of 
"taskmasters," as being those who most closely infest; and from the signification of "officers," as being those who most closely receive and communicate the infestations (n. 7111). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7124</b></p><p><b>7124.</b>
'And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out' means the sending out [and presence] of those in the nearest position to molest and those in the nearest position to receive. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'going out' as a sending out, for those meant by 'the taskmasters' are sent out to serve as a channel of communication, as may be seen from what has been stated above in <a href="7111.htm">7111</a> 
('coming out' or 'going out' also means making oneself present before another in a form suited to this other, see <a href="5337.htm">5337</a>, and so means presence as well); from the meaning of 'the taskmasters' as those who 
are in the nearest position to molest, and from that of 'the officers' as those who are in the nearest position to receive the molestations and pass them on, both of which groups are dealt with in <a href="7111.htm">7111</a>. </p>

</p><b>7124.</b>
`Et exiverunt exactores populi et moderatores ejus': quod significet emissionem [et praesentiam] illorum qui proxime infestant, et qui proxime recipiunt, constat ex significatione `exire' quod sit emissio, 
quia illi qui per `exactores' significantur {1} emittuntur ut inserviant pro medio communicandi, ut constare potest ab illis quae supra n. 7111 dicta sunt; quod `exire' etiam sit se sistere praesentem 
coram alio in forma ei accommodata, videatur n. (x)5337, ita quoque est praesentia; ex significatione `exactorum' quod sint qui proxime infestant; et ex significatione `moderatorum' quod sint 
qui infestationes proxime recipiunt et communicant, de quibus n. 7111. 	@1 i a pluribus$ </p>
