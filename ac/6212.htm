<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6212节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6212.</strong>从圣言清楚可知，先知们从灵人界和天堂接受流注。该流注部分通过梦，部分通过异象，部分通过话语临到他们。对有些先知来说，它也进入他们自己的言行，因而进入属于身体的事物；当这一切发生时，他们的言语也好，行为也好，都不是他们自己的，而属于当时占据他们身体的灵人。在这种时候，其中有些人表现得就像疯子，如扫罗露体躺卧，有的自残，有的把角披在自己身上等等。<br />我很想知道灵人如何引导他们做这些事，于是通过活生生的经历得到指示。为让我知道，灵人控制了我整整一个晚上；他们完全占据了我的身体能力，以至于若不以一种非常模糊的方式，我感觉这不是我自己的身体。当这些灵人到来时，他们看似以各种形状（大部分是尖的）聚集起来的小云朵，这些小云朵是黑色的。第二天早上，我看见一辆马车和两匹马，有一个人乘坐在马车上；然后我看见一匹马和骑在马上的人；当这匹马扬蹄的时候，这个人向后摔了下去，躺在了地上。之后我又看见一个人骑在这匹马上。这些马都很高贵。<br />看完这一切，天使告诉我它们表示什么，即：人乘坐其中的马车表示包含在他们所说预言中的灵义，以及他们通过我所看见的事物所代表的东西。把骑在上面的人摔下去并扬蹄的那匹马表示有这些预言在中间的犹太人和以色列人只对外在事物感兴趣，以至于真正的理解力把他们从它的背上摔了下去，可以说扬蹄把他们踢走。骑在马上的第二个人则表示那些对圣言预言部分的内义感兴趣的人所拥有的理解力。<br />持续了一整夜，直到第二天早上的这种状态指教我，灵人如何控制先知，通过他们说话和行动。这些灵人将先知的身体占据得如此彻底，以至于先知只剩下自己存在的意识。这种功能或功用被指定给某些灵人，其实他们并不想迷附人，只想进入一个人的身体情感；因为进入这些情感，就进入了其身体的一切事物。平常与我同在的灵人说，当我留在这种状态时，我并没有与他们在一起。<br />像以前控制先知的身体那样控制我的身体的灵人后来与我交谈，他们说，当时他们只知道他们的生命如在肉身里面那样，此外还说了很多。他们接着说，先知还是其它流注的接受者；这些流注能使他们受自己支配，利用他们自己的思维。那时，灵人只是简单地与他们交谈，主要是在他们里面交谈；不过，该流注不进入他们的思维和意愿，只进入传到他们听觉的言语。</p>

It is known from the Word that there was an influx from the world of spirits and from heaven into the prophets, partly by dreams, partly by visions, and partly by speech; and also with some into the 
very speech and into the very gestures, thus into the things that belong to the body; and that at the time they did not speak from themselves, nor act from themselves, but from the spirits who were then 
in possession of their bodies. At such times some of them behaved like insane persons, as did Saul when he lay naked; others when they wounded themselves; others when they put horns on themselves, 
and others in similar ways. [2] And as I longed to know in what manner these men were actuated by spirits, I was shown by means of a living experience. To this end I was for a whole night possessed by 
spirits, who so took possession of my bodily things that I had only a very obscure sensation that it was my own body. When these spirits came, they appeared like little clouds heaped together into various 
forms, for the most part pointed; the little clouds were black. In the morning I saw a chariot with a pair of horses, in which a man was being conveyed. Afterward I saw a horse on which someone 
was sitting, who was thrown off from the horse backward, and there lay while the horse was kicking. Afterward another was seen seated on a horse. They were noble horses. [3] After these things were 
seen, the angels told me what they signified, namely, that the chariot in which the man was, signified the spiritual sense that was in the prophetical things that were uttered, and which these represented; 
that the horse which threw his rider and kicked, signified the Jewish and Israelitish people with whom were these things, that people being solely in externals, and therefore the intellectual rejected 
them, and as it were by kicking put them away; and that the other sitting on the horse signified the intellectual with those who are in the internal sense of the prophetic Word. [4] From this 
state, in which I was during the night until morning, I was instructed how the prophets, through whom spirits spake and acted, were possessed; namely, that the spirits had possession of their bodies, 
insomuch that scarcely anything was left except that they knew that they existed. There were certain spirits appointed to this use, who did not desire to obsess men, but merely to enter into the man's 
bodily affections; and when they entered into these, they entered into all things of the body. The spirits who were usually with me said that I was absent from them while I remained in this state. [5] 
The spirits who possessed my body, as formerly the bodies of the prophets, afterward talked with me, and said that at the time they knew no otherwise than that they had life as when in the body, besides 
saying much more. I was told further that there were also other influxes with the prophets, to enable them to be at their own disposal, and to use their own thought, only that spirits spake with 
them, for the most part at that time within them; but that this influx was not into the thought and the will, but was merely a discourse that came to their hearing. </p>

It is well known from the Word that the prophets received influx from the world of spirits and from heaven. It came to them partly through dreams, partly through visions, and partly through utterances. 
With some prophets it also entered into their own speech and gestures, thus things of the body; and when this happened neither their utterances nor their actions were their own but were those of the 
spirits who occupied their bodies at the time. Some behaved as though they were insane, as when Saul lay down naked,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> some inflicted wounds on themselves,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and others wore horns;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> and there are many 
other examples of the same thing. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Having the desire to know how spirits led them to do those things, I was shown through actual experience. So that I might know, I was possessed for a whole 
night by spirits who occupied my bodily powers so fully that I could not feel it was my own body except in a very vague way. When those spirits came they looked like tiny clouds massed together in varying 
shapes, for the most part pointed ones; the tiny clouds were black. In the morning I saw a carriage with a pair of horses, and a man riding in it; then I saw a horse with someone sitting on it, 
who was thrown from the horse backwards and lay on the ground while the horse kicked up its heels. After that I saw someone else sitting on the horse. The horses were well-bred. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 After all this 
the angels told me the meaning of the things I had seen. The carriage with a man in it meant the spiritual sense contained in the prophecies which they were uttering, and those they were representing 
by the things I had seen. The horse that threw off the person sitting on it and that kicked up its heels meant that the Jewish and Israelite people among whom the prophecies existed were interested solely 
in things of an external nature, so that genuine understanding threw them off its back and so to speak kicked up its heels to move them away. The second person sitting on the horse meant the understanding 
which those people have who are interested in the internal sense of the prophetical part of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This state which lasted through the night until morning taught me the way the prophets 
through whom spirits spoke and acted were possessed. The spirits occupied the prophets' bodies so thoroughly that the prophets were left with hardly anything more than an awareness of their existence. 
There were particular spirits assigned to this function who had no wish to obsess men, only to enter a person's bodily affections, and having entered them they entered all things of his body. 
The spirits normally present with me said that I had not been with them while I remained in that state. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The spirits who possessed my body, in the way the bodies of prophets had been possessed in 
former times, afterwards talked to me. They said, besides much else, that at the time they knew nothing else than that their life was as it had been in the body. They went on to say that the prophets 
were recipients of further kinds of influx, ones that involved the prophets in the use of their own power of decision and thought. Spirits then simply talked to them, mainly within them; it was not 
a flowing into their thought and will, only speech which entered their hearing.

Notum est ex Verbo quod influxus e mundo spirituum et e caelo fuerit in prophetas, partim per somnia, partim per visiones, et partim per loquelam; et quoque apud quosdam in ipsam loquelam et in ipsos 
gestus, ita in illa quae sunt corporis; et quod tunc non loquerentur a se nec agerent a se, sed a spiritibus qui tunc occupabant corpus illorum; quidam tunc se sicut insani gerebant, ut Saul quod jaceret 
nudus, alii quod se vulnerarent, alii quod cornua sibi imponerent, et plura similia; [2]et quia desideravi scire quomodo illi agerentur a spiritibus, ostensum id mihi est per vivam experientiam; 
ob finem id sciendi, eram per totam noctem possessus a spiritibus qui ita occupabant corporea mea ut non nisi quam obscurissime sentire possem quod meum corpus esset; spiritus illi cum veniebant, apparebant 
sicut nubeculae in varias formas conglomeratae, utplurimum acuminatae; nubeculae erant nigrae.  Mane visus mihi est currus cum biga equorum in quo vir qui vehebatur; dein visus mihi est equus 
cui quis insidebat, qui rejectus ab equo retrorsum, et ibi jacuit equo recalcitrante; postea visus est alius equo insidens; equi erant generosi.  [3]Post haec angeli dicebant quid visa haec significarent, 
quod nempe currus in quo vir significaret sensum spiritualem qui inerat propheticis quae loquebantur, et quae repraesentabant; quod equus qui rejecit insidentem et recalcitravit, significaret populum 
Judaicum et Israeliticum apud quos prophetica, quod solum in externis essent, et sic quod intellectuale rejiceret et quasi per recalcitrationem amoveret illos; et quod alter equo insidens significaret 
intellectuale quod est illis qui in sensu interno Verbi prophetici sunt.  [4]Ex statu illo in quo per noctem usque ad mane fui, instructus sum quomodo prophetae per quos spiritus loquebantur et 
agebant, possessi fuerunt, nempe quod spiritus occuparent corpus eorum adeo ut vix aliquid residuum esset praeter quod scirent quod essent; fuerunt certi spiritus ad hunc usum qui non obsidere voluerunt 
homines, sed solum intrare in hominis affectiones corporeas, in quas cum intrarent, in omnia corporis intrabant. Spiritus qui solito apud me, dicebant quod abessem ab illis cum in illo statu manerem. 
 [5]Spiritus qui possidebant corpus meum, sicut olim prophetarum, postea mecum locuti sunt, et dicebant quod prorsus non aliter tunc noverint quam quod vita illis esset sicut in corpore, praeter plura 
alia.  Praeterea dictum quod etiam alii influxus apud prophetas fuerint, nempe quod essent sui juris et suae cogitationis, solum quod spiritus cum illis loquerentur, plerumque tunc intus in illis; 
sed quod non esset influxus in cogitationem et voluntatem, sed solum esset sermo qui ad auditum illorum pervenit. </p>
