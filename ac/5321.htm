<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5321.</strong>“又叫约瑟坐副车”表一个外在标志，即属灵层的属天层是良善与真理的一切教义的源头。这从“车”的含义清楚可知，“车”是指良善与真理的教义，如下文所述；因此，他叫“约瑟坐车”是一个标志，表示属灵层的属天层是该教义的源头。这些话与之前法老所说的话有关，即：你可以掌管我的家，我的民都必与你亲嘴，惟独在宝座上我比你大（41:40）。“约瑟”之所以表示涉及良善与真理的教义，是因为“约瑟”代表主的神性属灵层（参看<a href="3971.htm">3971</a>，<a href="4669.htm">4669</a>节），因而代表从主的神性人身发出的神性真理（<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="4727.htm">4727</a>节），属灵层的属天层就来自这神性真理。关于良善与真理的一切教义皆来自这一源头，即源于属灵层的属天层。这是因为就真正意义而言，主就是教义本身；事实上，教义的一切细节皆从祂发出，教义的一切细节皆论述祂。因为一切教义皆论述爱之良善和信之真理；这些来自主，或主是这些的源头，故主不仅在它们里面，而且在真正意义上就是这二者。由此明显可知，论述良善与真理的教义唯独论述主；它从主的神性人身发出。<br />若不通过神性人身，也就是通过圣言，根本没有任何教义从神性本身发出；就至高意义而言，圣言就是来自主的神性人身的神性真理。直接从神性本身发出之物，就连至内在天堂的天使也不理解，因为它是无限的，因而超越一切理解力，甚至超越天使的理解力。不过，他们能理解从主的神性人身发出之物，因为它论述作为一个神性人的神，从祂的人身能对作为神性人的神形成某种观念。无论对这人身形成何种观念，只要它是从纯真的良善流出的，并且存在于仁之良善里面，就是可悦纳的。这就是主在约翰福音中的话所表示的：<br />没有人在任何时候见过神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br /><br />你们在任何时候都没有听见父的声音，也没有看见祂的形像。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.27.htm">11:27</a>）<br />在圣言中，许多地方提到“车”，但几乎没有人知道它们表示良善与真理的教义事物，以及属于教义事物的记忆知识。缺乏这种知识的原因在于，当提及“车”时，进入人思维的只是属世的历史，而非属灵事物；车前面的马也是这种情况。但在圣言中，“马”表示理解力（参看<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>节），所以“车”表示教义事物及其所属的记忆知识。<br />“车”表示教会的教义事物，以及记忆知识，这一点从来世经常看到的“车”清楚向我显明。右方靠近低地有一个地方也出现了车和马，还有一排排的马厩。在那个地方，只见在世时被视为有学问，并视生活为学问的目的之人在漫步，彼此交谈。他们所看到的这些车和马就来源于高层天堂的天使；当这些天使的谈话转向理解力的事物、教义的事物和知识的事物时，低地周围的灵人就会看到这些车和马。<br />“车”和“马”表示这类事物，这一点从以下事实很明显地看出来：只见以利亚被火车火马接往天上去了，他和以利沙被称为“以色列的战车，以色列的马兵”，如我们在列王纪下所读到的：<br />看哪，有火车火马来到他们中间，以利亚就乘旋风升天去了。以利沙看见就呼喊，我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车，以色列的马兵啊！（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.11.htm">2:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.12.htm">12</a>）<br />关于以利沙，我们在本书读到：<br />以利沙患了必死的病，以色列王约阿施下来看他，伏在他脸上哭泣说，我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车，以色列的马兵啊！（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下13.14.htm">13:14</a>）<br />他们之所以被如此称呼，是因为他们二人，即以利亚和以利沙，代表圣言方面的主（参看创世记18章序言，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="5247.htm">5247</a>e节）。圣言本身主要是关于良善与真理的教义，因为教义的一切皆来自圣言，或说圣言是一切教义的源头。由于同样的原因，耶和华开了少年人的眼目后，“他就看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙”（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下6.17.htm">6:17</a>）。<br />“车”表示教义事物，“马”表示理性概念，这一事实也可从圣言的其它经文清楚看出来，如以西结书：<br />你们必在我席上饱吃马匹和战车，并勇士和一切的战士。我必显我的荣耀在列族中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.20.htm">39:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">19:18</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。谁都能看出，“马匹和战车”在此并非表示马匹和战车；因为人们不会在主的席上饱吃这些东西，而是饱吃诸如“马匹和战车”在灵义上所表示的那类事物，也就是理性概念或理解力的事物，和关于良善与真理的教义事物。<br />在以下经文中，“马”和“车”表示类似事物。诗篇：<br />神的车辇累万盈千，主在其中，好像西乃在圣中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.17.htm">68:17</a>）<br /><br />耶和华披上亮光如衣裳，铺张诸天如幔子；在水中立楼阁的栋梁，用云彩为车辇，藉着风的翅膀而行。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.2.htm">104:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />论海旁旷野的预言：主对我如此说，你去设立守望者，使他将所看见的述说。他看见一辆战车，一对骑马的，一辆驴拉的车，一辆骆驼拉的车，他要留心听，仔细地听。因为狮子吼叫，主啊，我白日常站在在守望塔上，整夜立在我守望所。看哪，有一车人，一对骑马的。他就说，巴比伦倾倒了，倾倒了！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.1.htm">21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.9.htm">9</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />他们必将你们的弟兄从列族中送回，使他们或骑马，或坐车，坐轿，骑骡子，骑独峰驼，到我的圣山耶路撒冷，作为供物献给耶和华。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.20.htm">66:20</a>）<br /><br />看哪，耶和华必在火中降临。祂的车辇像旋风。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.15.htm">66:15</a>）<br />哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华岂是向江河发怒，向江河生气，向海洋发烈怒吗？你骑在马上，你的战车是救赎。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.8.htm">3:8</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我又举目观看，见有四辆车从两山之间出来；那山是铜山。第一辆车套着红马，第二辆车套着黑马，三辆车套着白马，第四辆车套着有斑点的壮马。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.3.htm">3</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />那时就有坐大卫宝座的君王和首领，他们和他们的首领，犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民或坐车，或骑马进入这城的各门。而且这城必存到永远。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.25.htm">17:25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.4.htm">22:4</a>）<br />“必存到永远的这城”不是指耶路撒冷，而是指“耶路撒冷”所表示的主的教会（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>节）；“进入这城的各门的君王”不是指君王，而是指教会的真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>节）；因此，“首领”不是指首领，而是指真理的主要事物（<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）；“坐大卫宝座的”是指从主发出的神性真理（<a href="5313.htm">5313</a>节）；“坐车、骑马的”是指随之的理性概念和教义事物。“车”在圣言的历史中也经常被提及；由于这些历史都具有代表性，用来描述它们的话表示诸如在主的国度和教会中的那类事物，所以那里的“车”具有相同的含义。<br />在圣言中，大多数事物也有一个反面意义，故“车”也有一个反面意义。它们在反面意义上表示邪恶与虚假的教义事物，以及确认它们的记忆知识，如以下经文：<br />祸哉！那些下埃及求帮助的，是因仗赖马匹，倚靠甚多的车辆，并倚靠强壮的马兵，却不仰望以色列的圣者。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.1.htm">31:1</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你借你臣仆的手辱骂主说，我率领许多战车上群山的高峰，到黎巴嫩极深之处；我要砍伐其中高大的香柏树和佳美的松树。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.24.htm">37:24</a>）<br />这是回复拉伯沙基，服事亚述王的首领的辱骂之话的预言。耶利米书：<br />看哪，有水从北方发起，成为涨溢的溪河，要涨过遍地和其中所有的，并城和其中所住的。地上所有的居民听见敌人壮马蹄跳的响声和战车隆隆，车轮轰轰都必哀号。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.2.htm">47:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />因他的马匹众多，尘土扬起遮蔽你。他进入你的城门，好像人进入已有破口之城。那时，你的墙垣必因骑马的、轮子和战车的响声震动。他的马蹄必践踏你一切的街道。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.10.htm">26:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.11.htm">11</a>）<br />哈该书：<br />我必倾覆列国的宝座，除灭外族万国的势力，并倾覆战车和坐在其上的。马匹和骑马的都必跌倒。（哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.22.htm">2:22</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我必除灭以法莲的战车和耶路撒冷的战马，争战的弓也必除灭。祂必向列族讲和平。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.10.htm">9:10</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />埃及像尼罗河涨起，其水翻腾像江河；因为他说，我要涨发遮盖遍地，我要毁灭城邑和其中的居民。马匹上去吧！车辆急行吧！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.8.htm">46:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.9.htm">9</a>）<br />埃及人追赶以色列人，以及法老下海（当时在海里，车轮脱落）所用的“马匹和车辆”，以及论及这些马匹和车辆、占用大量篇幅的其它事物（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.6.htm">14:6</a>-<a

And he made him ride in the second chariot. That this signifies a significative that from Him comes all the doctrine of good and truth, is evident from the signification of a "chariot," as being the 
doctrine of good and truth (of which presently); hence his "making him ride in a chariot" is a significative that this doctrine comes therefrom. These words refer to what was previously said by Pharaoh: 
"Thou shalt be over my house, and upon thy mouth shall all my people kiss; only in the throne will I be greater than thou" (verse 40). That the doctrine of good and truth coming from Him is signified, 
is because by Joseph is represented the Lord as to the Divine spiritual (see n. 3971, 4669), thus as to the Divine truth from the Lord's Divine Human (n. 4723, 4727), from which Divine truth is the 
celestial of the spiritual. That everything of the doctrine of good and truth is from this source, is because the Lord is doctrine itself, for everything of doctrine proceeds from Him, and everything 
of doctrine treats of Him; for all doctrine treats of the good of love and of the truth of faith. These are from the Lord, and therefore the Lord is not only in them, but also is both. From this it 
is evident that the doctrine that treats of good and truth, treats of the Lord only; and that it proceeds from His Divine Human. [2] From the Divine Itself nothing of doctrine can possibly proceed except 
through the Divine Human, that is, through the Word, which in the supreme sense is the Divine truth from the Lord's Divine Human. Not even the angels in the inmost heaven can apprehend that which 
proceeds immediately from the Divine Itself, because it is infinite, and therefore transcends all apprehension, even that of angels. But that which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human they can apprehend, 
because it treats of God as a Divine Man, concerning whom some idea can be formed from the Human; and any idea whatever formed about the Human is accepted, provided it flows from the good of innocence, 
and is in the good of charity. This is what is meant by the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him 
forth (John 1:18). In the same: </p>
<p>	Ye have neither heard the Father's voice at any time, nor seen His shape (John 5:37). And in Matthew: </p>
<p>	No one knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever 
the Son willeth to reveal Him (Matt. 11:27). [3] "Chariots" are very frequently mentioned in the Word, but hardly anyone knows that they signify doctrinal things of good and truth, and also the memory-knowledges 
belonging to doctrinal things. The reason is that when a "chariot" is mentioned nothing spiritual enters the idea, but only the natural historical, and it is the same with the horses in 
front of the chariot; and yet by "horses" in the Word are signified things of the understanding (see n. 2760-2762, 3217), and therefore by a "chariot" are signified doctrinal things and the memory-knowledges 
belonging thereto. [4] That "chariots" denote the doctrinal things of the church, and also memory-knowledges, has been evident to me from the chariots so often seen in the other life. There 
is also a place to the right near the lower earth where chariots and horses appear, with stalls set in order, and where are seen walking and conversing men who in the world have been learned, and have 
regarded the life as the end of learning. Such things appear to them from the angels in the higher heavens; for when these are discoursing about things of the understanding, of doctrine, and of knowledge, 
such objects appear to the spirits there. [5] That such things are signified by "chariots" and "horses" is very obvious from the fact that Elijah appeared to be carried into heaven by a chariot 
of fire and horses of fire, and that he and also Elisha were called "the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof," as we read in the second book of Kings: </p>
<p>	Behold a chariot of fire and horses of 
fire came between them; and Elijah went up in a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof (2 Kings 2:11, 12); </p>
<p>and regarding 
Elisha in the same book: </p>
<p>	When Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died, and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept before his faces, and said, My father, my father, 
the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof (2 Kings 13:14); </p>
<p>the reason why they were so called is that by both Elijah and Elisha was represented the Lord as to the Word (see preface to chapter 
18 of Genesis, and n. 2762, 5247e). The Word itself is chiefly the doctrine of good and truth, for from it is everything of doctrine. It was for the same reason that to the boy whose eyes Jehovah opened, 
the mountain appeared "full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6:17). [6] That a "chariot" signifies what is doctrinal, and a "horse" what is intellectual, is evident 
also from other passages in the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	Ye shall be sated upon My table with horse and chariot, with mighty man and every man of war. So will I set My glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:20; 
Rev. 19:18); </p>
<p>where the coming of the Lord is treated of. That by "horse and chariot" here are not signified horse and chariot, is plain to everyone; for they were not to be sated upon the Lord's 
table with these, but with such things as are signified by "horse and chariot," which are the things of the understanding and of the doctrine of good and truth. [7] Similar things are signified by "horses" 
and "chariots," in the following passages. In David: </p>
<p>	The chariots of God are two myriads, thousands of peaceful ones; the Lord is in them; Sinai is in the sanctuary (Ps. 68:17). Again: </p>
<p>	Jehovah 
covereth Himself with light as with a garment, He stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain, He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters, He maketh the clouds His chariots, He walketh upon 
the wings of the wind (Ps. 104:2-3). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>	The prophecy of the wilderness of the sea. Thus hath the Lord said unto me, Set a watchman to watch, he will declare; so he saw a chariot, a pair of 
horsemen, a chariot of an ass, a chariot of a camel, and he hearkened a hearkening, a great hearkening; for a lion cried upon the watchtower, Lord, I stand continually in the daytime, and upon my ward 
I am set all the nights; then in very deed lo a chariot of a man, a pair of horsemen; and he said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen (Isa. 21:1, 6-9). [8] In the same: </p>
<p>	Then will they bring all your brethren 
in all nations an offering to Jehovah, upon horses, and upon chariot, and upon litters, and upon mules, and upon couriers, to the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem (Isa. 66:20). Again: </p>
<p>	Behold 
Jehovah will come in fire, and His chariots shall be like the whirlwind (Isa. 66:15). In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>	Was Jehovah enraged with the rivers? Was Thine anger against the rivers? Was Thy wrath against the 
sea, that Thou didst ride upon Thy horses? Thy chariots are salvation (Hab. 3:8). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>	I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold four chariots coming out from between two mountains; and 
the mountains were mountains of brass. In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot, black horses; in the third chariot, white horses; and in the fourth chariot, grizzled horses (Zech. 
6:1-3). [9] Also in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	There shall enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in the chariot and on horses, they and their princes, the man 
of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited forever (Jer. 17:25; 22:4). The "city that shall be inhabited forever" is not Jerusalem, but the Lord's church signified 
by "Jerusalem" (n. 402, 2117, 3654); the "kings who shall enter in by the gates of that city" are not kings, but the truths of the church (n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 
5068); thus "princes" are not princes, but the primary things of truth (n. 1482, 2089, 5044); "they who sit upon the throne of David" are Divine truths that proceed from the Lord (n. 5313); "they who 
ride in chariot and on horses" are the derivative things of understanding and of doctrine. "Chariots" are frequently mentioned also in the histories of the Word; and because these histories are all 
representative, and the expressions signify things such as are in the Lord's kingdom and in the church, "chariots" therein also have a similar signification. [10] As most of the expressions in the Word 
have also an opposite sense, so have "chariots," and in this sense they signify doctrinal things of evil and falsity, and also the memory-knowledges that confirm them, as in these passages: </p>
<p>	Woe 
unto them that go down into Egypt for help, and depend upon horse, and trust upon chariot, because they are many, and upon horse men because they are very strong; but they look not unto the holy one of 
Israel (Isa. 31:1). 	By the hand of thy servants hast thou blasphemed the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariot am I come to the height of the mountains, the sides of Lebanon; where I 
will cut off the loftiness of its cedars, the choice of its fir trees (Isa. 37:24); </p>
<p>a prophetic reply to the haughty words of Rabshakeh, the king of Assyria's general. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	Behold waters coming 
up from the north that shall become an overflowing stream and shall overflow the land and the fullness thereof, the city and them that dwell therein, and all the inhabitant of the land shall howl 
at the voice of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the tumult of his chariot, at the rumbling of his wheels (Jer. 47:2-3). [11] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	By reason of the abundance of his horses 
their dust shall cover thee; thy walls shall shake by reason of the voice of the horseman and of the wheel and of the chariot, when he shall come into thy gates, beside the entrances of a city wherein 
is made a breach; by the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets (Ezek. 26:10-11). In Haggai: </p>
<p>	I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms 
of the nations; I will also overthrow the chariot and those that ride in it, and the horses and their riders shall come down (Hag. 2:22). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>	I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, 
and the horse from Jerusalem, I will cut off the battle bow; and He shall speak peace unto the nations (Zech. 9:10). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	Egypt riseth up like a stream, and his waters toss themselves like 
the streams; for he said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and the inhabitants therein. Go up, ye horses; rage, ye chariots (Jer. 46:8-9). [12] By the "horses and chariots" 
with which the Egyptians pursued the sons of Israel, and with which Pharaoh entered the sea Suph, where the wheels of the chariots were taken off, and by other things said of the horses and chariots, 
which make the larger part of that description (Exod. 14:6-7, 9, 17, 23, 25-26; 15:4, 19), are signified the things of understanding, of doctrine, and of false knowledge, together with the reasonings 
founded on them, that pervert and extinguish the truths of the church. The destruction and death of such things is there described. </p>

'And he made him ride in the second chariot' means an outward sign that the celestial of the spiritual was the source of all the teaching about goodness and truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the 
chariot' as teaching which has reference to goodness and truth, dealt with below, so that 'making him ride in the chariot' is a sign denoting that the celestial of the spiritual was the source of 
that teaching. This particular matter is connected with what Pharaoh has stated previously, in verse 40,  </p>
<p>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall kiss you on the mouth; only in the throne 
will I be great, more than you. </p>
<p>The reason why teaching that has reference to goodness and truth is meant by 'Joseph' is that 'Joseph' represents the Lord's Divine Spiritual, <a href="3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="4669.htm">4669</a>, and so 
Divine Truth going forth from the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="4717.htm">4717</a>, the celestial of the spiritual being an extension of that Divine Truth. The reason why all the teaching about goodness and truth is derived 
from the celestial of the spiritual is that in a real sense the Lord is that teaching since every detail of it comes forth from Him and every detail of it has reference to Him. For all that teaching 
has reference to the good of love and the truth of faith; and since the Lord is the source of these, He is not merely present within them but in a real sense is both of them. From this it is clear 
that teaching which has reference to goodness and truth has reference to the Lord alone, and that such goes forth from His Divine Human. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 No doctrine at all can possibly go forth from the Divine 
itself except through the Divine Human, that is, through the Word, which in the highest sense is Divine Truth coming from the Lord's Divine Human. That which goes forth directly from the Divine itself 
cannot be understood even by angels in the inmost heaven. The reason for this is that it is infinite and so surpasses all understanding, even that of angels. But that which goes forth from the Lord's 
Divine Human is capable of being understood, for such truth refers to God as Divine Man, of whom some idea can be formed from His Human. No matter what kind of idea has been formed about that Human, 
it is an acceptable one if only the good of innocence has been inspired into it and the good of charity is present within it. This is the meaning of the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has ever seen 
God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
You have never heard the Father's voice nor seen His shape. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
No one knows the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:27</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Chariots are mentioned in very many places in the Word, yet scarcely anyone knows 
that matters of doctrine concerning goodness and truth, and also factual knowledge attached to those matters of doctrine, are meant by 'chariots'. The reason for such lack of knowledge is that nothing 
spiritual, only what is natural and historical, enters their thinking when 'a chariot' is mentioned, or similarly when the horses in front of a chariot are mentioned. But in the Word the powers 
of the understanding are meant by 'horses', <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3117.htm">3117</a>, and therefore 'a chariot' means matters of doctrine and associated factual knowledge. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It has become clear to me from the chariots which 
I have seen so many times in the next life that 'chariots' means the matters of doctrine and also the factual knowledge which the Church possesses. There is also a place over on the right, around 
the lower earth, where chariots and horses, together with rows of stables, appear. In that place people who in the world were considered learned, and who thought that life was the end in view of learning, 
stroll and converse with one another. The origin of such chariots and horses seen by them lies with the angels in higher heavens; when these angels' conversation turns to intellectual concepts, and 
to matters of doctrine and to known facts, those chariots and horses are seen by the spirits around the lower earth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The fact that such things are meant by 'chariots and horses' is perfectly 
plain from the occasion when Elijah was seen riding into heaven in a chariot of fire with horses of fire, and from what both he and Elisha were called - 'the chariot of Israel and its horsemen'. The 
two of them are spoken of in the second Book of Kings as follows, </p>
<p>Behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire came between them, and Elijah went up in a whirlwind into heaven; Elisha saw this and 
cried out, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2:11, <a href="12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<p>And in a reference to Elisha in the same book, </p>
<p>When Elisha was sick with the illness from which he died, 
Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept before his face and said, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 13:14. </p>
<p>The reason they were called this is that 
both of them - Elijah and Elisha - represented the Lord as to the Word, see Preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="5247.htm">5247</a> (end). The Word itself is primarily doctrinal teaching about what is good and true, for 
the Word is the source of all doctrinal teaching. It was for the same reason that Elisha's servant, whose eyes had been opened by Jehovah, saw around Elisha, </p>
<p>A mountain full of horses and chariots 
of fire. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 6:17. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that 'chariot' means matters of doctrine and 'horse' intellectual concepts is also clear from other places in the Word, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>You will be filled at 
My table with horse and chariot, with mighty man and every man of war. Thus will I bring My glory to the nations. Ezek. 39:20, <a href="11.htm">11</a>; Rev. 19:18. </p>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming. Anyone can see that 
here 'horse and chariot' does not mean horse and chariot, for people are not going to be filled with these at the Lord's table but with such things as are meant spiritually by 'horse and chariot', which 
are intellectual concepts and matters of doctrine regarding what is good and true. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Much the same is meant by 'horses' and 'chariots' in the following places: In David, </p>
<p>The chariots of God 
are myriad on myriad,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> thousands of peacemakers; the Lord is within them, Sinai is within the sanctuary. Ps. 68:17. </p>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<p>Jehovah covers Himself with light as with a garment; He 
stretches out the heavens like a curtain, laying the beams for His upper chambers<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> on the waters; He makes the clouds His chariots; He walks on the wings of the wind. Ps 104:2, <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<p>The 
prophecy of the wilderness of the sea. Thus said the Lord to me, Set a watchman; let him announce what he sees. He therefore saw a chariot, a pair of horsemen, a chariot of asses, a chariot of camels, 
and he listened diligently, with great care. For a lion cried out on the watchtower, O Lord, I am standing continually during the daytime, and at my post I have been set every night. Now behold, a 
chariot of men, a pair of horsemen. And he said, Fallen, fallen has Babylon. Isa. 21:1, <a href="6.htm">6</a>-<a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>At that time they will bring all your brothers in all nations as an offering 
to Jehovah, on horses, and in chariots, and in covered waggons, and on mules, and on fast runners, to My holy mountain, Jerusalem. Isa. 66:20. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>Behold, Jehovah will come in 
fire, and His chariots will be like a whirlwind. Isa. 66:15. </p>
<p>In Habakkuk, </p>
<p>Has Jehovah been displeased with the rivers? Has Your anger turned against the rivers, has Your wrath turned against the 
sea, that You ride on Your horses, Your chariots being salvation? Hab. 3:8. </p>
<p>In Zechariah, </p>
<p>I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots coming out from between two mountains; but the mountains 
were mountains of bronze. The horses coupled to the first chariot were reddish, the horses coupled to the second chariot were black, the horses coupled to the third chariot were white, and the 
horses coupled to the fourth chariot were mottled. Zech. 6:1-3. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 And in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>There will enter through the gates of this city kings and princes seated on the throne of David, riding in 
chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city will be inhabited for ever. Jer. 17:25; 12:4. </p>
<p>'The city that will be inhabited for ever' 
is not Jerusalem but the Lord's Church meant by 'Jerusalem', <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>. The kings who will enter through the gates of that city are not kings but truths known to the Church, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>, <a href="5068.htm">5068</a>. Thus 'princes' are not princes but the first and foremost aspects of truth, <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>. Those 'seated on the throne of David' are Divine Truths 
which go forth from the Lord, <a href="5313.htm">5313</a>; and those 'riding in chariots and on horses' are consequently intellectual concepts and matters of doctrine. Chariots are also mentioned many times in historical descriptions 
in the Word; and since historical events are representative of, and the words used to describe them mean, the kinds of things that exist in the Lord's kingdom and in the Church, 'chariots' 
have a similar meaning there also. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Since most things in the Word also have a contrary meaning, so too does 'chariots'. In that contrary sense matters of doctrine maintaining what is evil and 
false, also factual knowledge used to lend support to these, are meant by 'chariots', as in the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<p>Woe to those who go down into Egypt for help and rely on horses and trust 
in chariots because they are many, and on horsemen because they are extremely strong, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel. Isa. 31:1. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>By the hand of your<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> servants 
you have spoken ill of the Lord and have said, By the multitude of my chariots I have gone up [to] the height of the mountains, the sides of Lebanon, where I will cut down the tallness of its cedars, 
the choice of its fir trees. Isa. 37:24. </p>
<p>This is a prophecy delivered in response to the haughty words spoken by the Rabshakeh, a leader serving the king of Assyria. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<p>Behold, waters 
rising out of the north which will become a deluging stream, and they will deluge the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it. And every inhabitant of the land will wail at the 
sound of the beat of the hoofs of the horses his mighty ones, at the noise of his chariot, the rumble of its wheels. Jer. 47:2, <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>By reason of the abundance of his horses their 
dust will cover you; by reason of the noise of horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, your walls will be shaken, when he comes into your gates, like the entry into a city that has been breached. By means 
of the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. Ezek. 26:10, <a href="11.htm">11</a>. </p>
<p>In Haggai, </p>
<p>I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. 
I will also overthrow the chariots and those riding in them; the horses and their riders will come down. Hagg. 2:22. </p>
<p>In Zechariah, </p>
<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from 
Jerusalem, I will cut off the battle bow. On the other hand He will speak peace to the nations. Zech. 9:10. </p>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Egypt comes up like the river, like the rivers his waters are tossed about. 
For he said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those who dwell in it. Go up, O horses; rage, O chariots. Jer. 46:8, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 The horses and chariots with which the 
Egyptians pursued the children of Israel and with which Pharaoh entered the Sea Suph, when the wheels of the chariots were made to come off, and much else regarding the horses and chariots which forms 
the major part of the description - Exod. 14:6, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a> and 15:4,<a href="19.htm">19</a> - mean intellectual concepts, matters of doctrine, and known facts which maintain what is false. They also mean therefore 
reasonings which pervert and destroy the truths known to the Church. The destruction and death of such reasonings is described there.

`Et vehi fecit eum in curru secundario': quod significet significativum quod ab illo omnis doctrina boni et veri, constat ex significatione `currus' quod sit doctrina boni et veri, de qua sequitur; 
inde 'vehi facere eum in curru' est significativum quod ab illo doctrina illa; haec se referunt ad illa quae prius a Pharaone dicta sunt, `Tu eris super domo mea, et super ore tuo osculabitur omnis populus 
meus, tantum solio magnus ero prae te', vers. 40. Quod ab ipso doctrina boni et veri significetur, est quia per `Josephum' repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum spirituale, n. 3971,4669, ita quoad 
Divinum Verum ex Divino Humano Domini, n. 4723, 4727, a quo Divino Vero est caeleste spiritualis; quod omne doctrinae boni et veri sit inde, est quia Dominus est ipsa doctrina, nam omne doctrinae ab 
Ipso procedit, et omne doctrinae de Ipso agit; omne enim doctrinae agit de bono amoris et vero fidei; a Domino sunt illa, {1}quare Dominus non solum est in illis sed etiam est utrumque; inde constat 
quod doctrina quae agit de bono et vero, agat de solo Domino, et quod procedat {2}ex Divino Humano Ipsius; [2] ex Ipso Divino nequaquam {3}aliquod doctrinae procedere potest nisi per Divinum Humanum, 
hoc est, per Verbum, quod in sensu supremo est Divinum Verum a Divino Humano Domini; quod procedit (e)ab Ipso Divino immediate, hoc ne quidem angeli in intimo caelo possunt capere; causa est quia id (t)est 
infinitum et sic transcendit omnem captum, etiam angelicum; at quod procedit ex Divino Humano Domini, hoc possunt capere, {4}nam agit de Deo ut de Divino Homine, de quo ex Humano aliqua idea formari 
potest, et idea quae {5}formata de Humano, acceptatur qualiscumque sit, modo ex bono innocentiae fluat et in bono charitatis sit; hoc est quod intelligitur per Domini verba apud Johannem,  Deum 
nemo vidit unquam, Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu Patris est, {6}Ipse exposuit, i 18:  apud eundem,  Neque vocem Patris audivistis unquam, neque speciem Ipsius vidistis, v 37:  et apud Matthaeum,  {7}Non 
Patrem quisquam cognoscit, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare, xi 27. [3] Currus in Verbo plurimis in locis memorantur et vix aliquis scit quod per illos ibi significentur doctrinalia 
boni et veri, ut et scientifica quae sunt doctrinalium; causa est quia non aliquod spirituale intrat ideam sed solum naturale historicum cum nominatur `currus', sicut etiam cum `equi qui ante currum', 
cum tamen per `equos' significantur in Verbo intellectualia, n. 2760-2762, 3217, et inde per `currum' doctrinalia et eorum scientifica. [4] Quod `currus' sint Ecclesiae doctrinalia et quoque scientifica, 
constare mihi potuit ex curribus toties visis in altera vita; est quoque locus ad dextrum circa terram inferiorem ubi apparent currus et equi cum stabulis in ordine positis; ambulant ibi et confabulantur 
{8} qui in mundo eruditi fuerunt et pro fine eruditionis habuerunt vitam; talia apparent illis ex angelis in superioribus caelis, {9}quibus cum sermo est de intellectualibus, deque doctrinalibus 
et scientificis, tunc spiritibus {10}ibi apparent talia. [5] Quod talia per currus et equos significentur, {11}admodum manifeste patet ex eo quod Elias apparuerit in caelum vectus curru ignis et 
equis ignis, et quod {12}ille ut et Elisha appellati sint `currus Israelis et equites ejus', de quibus ita in Libro 2 Regum,  Ecce currus ignis et equi ignis intervenerunt inter illos, et ascendit 
Elias in turbine in caelum, et Elisha videns et clamans, Pater mi, pater mi, currus Israelis et equites ejus, ii 11, 12:  et de Elisha in eodem Libro,  Cum Elisha aegrotabat morbo suo quo mortuus est, 
descendit ad eum Joash, rex Israelis, et flevit ante facies ejus, et dixit, Pater mi, pater mi, currus Israelis et equites ejus, xiii 14;  causa quod illi sic appellati sint, est quia per utrumque, 
tam Eliam quam Elisham, repraesentatus est Dominus quoad Verbum, videatur Praef. ad Gen. xviii, et n. 2762, 5247 fin.; ipsum Verbum principaliter est doctrina boni et veri, nam inde est omne doctrinae; 
(m)ex eadem (t)causa etiam erat quod circum Elisham visus sit puero, cujus oculos aperuit Jehovah,  Mons plenus equis et curribus ignis, 2 Reg. vi (x)17 {13}:(n) [6] quod `currus' sit doctrinale, 
et `equus' {14}intellectuale, constat quoque ex aliis locis in Verbo, ut apud Ezechielem, Satiabimini super mensa Mea equo et curru, forti et omni viro belli; sic dabo gloriam Meam gentibus, xxxix 
20 [21]; Apoc. xix 18;  ibi agitur de Adventu Domini; quod ibi per `equum et currum' non significetur equus et currus, cuivis patet, his enim `super mensa Domini non satiandi erunt' sed talibus quae 
per equum et currum significantur, nempe intellectualibus et doctrinalibus boni et veri. [7] Similia per equos et currus significantur in sequentibus his locis: apud Davidem,  Currus Dei sunt binae myriades, 
milleni pacificorum, Dominus in illis, Sinai in sanctuario, Ps. lxviii 18 [A.V. 17]: </p>
<p>apud eundem,  Jehovah operit Se luce quasi veste, extendit caelos sicut cortinam, contignans aquis triclinia 
Sua, ponit nubes currus Suos, ambulat super alis venti, Ps. civ 2, 3: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam,  Propheticum deserti maris: . . . Sic dixit ad me Dominus, Constitue speculatorem qui spectet, nuntiet; vidit 
ergo currum, par equitum, {15}currum asini, currum cameli, et auscultavit auscultationem, magna auscultatio; clamavit enim leo super specula, Domine, ego stans jugiter interdiu, et super custodia mea 
ego constitutus omnibus noctibus; tum vero ecce currus viri, par equitum; . . . et dixit, Cecidit, cecidit Babel, xxi [1,] 6-9: </p>
<p>[8] apud eundem,  Tunc adducent omnes fratres vestros in omnibus gentibus 
munus Jehovae super equis, et super curru, et super redis cameratis, et super mulis, et super veredariis, ad montem sanctitatis Meae, Hierosolymam, lxvi 20:  apud eundem,  Ecce Jehovah in igne veniet, 
et sicut procella currus Ipsius, lxvi 15:  apud Habakkuk,  Num fluviis succensuit Jehovah? num contra fluvios ira Tua? num contra mare excandescentia Tua? quod equitas super equis Tuis, currus 
Tui salus? iii 8:  apud Zachariam,  Sustuli oculos meos et vidi, cum ecce quatuor currus, exeuntes ab inter duos montes, montes autem montes aeris; ad currum primum equi rufi, ad currum secundum equi 
nigri, ad currum tertium equi albi, et ad currum quartum equi grandinati, vi 1-3:  [9] et apud Jeremiam,  Intrabunt per portas civitatis hujus reges et principes, sedentes super throno Davidis, 
equitantes in curru et equis, ipsi et principes eorum, vir Jehudae, et habitatores Hierosolymae, et habitabitur civitas haec in saeculum, xvii 25, xxii 4;  `civitas quae habitabitur in saeculum' non 
est Hierosolyma sed Ecclesia Domini quae per `Hierosolymam' significatur, n. 402, 2117, 3654; 'reges qui per portas civitatis illius intrabunt' non sunt reges sed Ecclesiae vera, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 
2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068; ita `principes' nec sunt principes sed primaria veri, n. 1482, 2089, 5044; `sedentes super throno Davidis' sunt Divina Vera quae procedunt a Domino, n. 
5313; `equitantes in curru et equis' sunt inde intellectualia et doctrinalia. Currus etiam in historicis Verbi multoties {16}memorantur, et quia historica Verbi omnia repraesentant, et voces significant, 
talia quae in regno Domini et in Ecclesia, ibi quoque `currus' similia {16}significant. [10] {17} Quia pleraque in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum habent, ita quoque `currus', et in illo sensu significant 
doctrinalia mali et falsi, {18}tum scientifica illa confirmantia; ut in his locis: apud Esaiam,  Vae descendentibus in Aegyptum pro auxilio, et super equo innituntur, et confidunt super curru quod 
multus, et super equitibus quod validi sint valde, sed non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, xxxi 1:  apud eundem, Per manum servorum {19}tuorum blasphemasti Dominum, et dixisti, Per multitudinem 
currus mei ego ascendi altitudinem montium, latera Libani, ubi exscindam proceritatem cedrorum ejus, electionem abietum ejus, xxxvii 24;  ibi responsum propheticum ad verba elata Rabshakes ducis regis 
Asshuris: apud Jeremiam,  Ecce aquae ascendentes a septentrione, quae fient in flumen inundans, et inundabunt terram et plenitudinem ejus, urbem et habitantes in illa; . . . et ejulabit omnis habitator 
terrae a voce plausus equorum ungularum fortium ejus, a tumultu currus ejus, strepitu rotarum ejus, xlvii 2, 3: </p>
<p>[11] apud Ezechielem,  Prae abundantia equorum ejus obteget te pulvis eorum, prae 
voce equitis et rotae, et currus, commovebuntur muri tui, quando venerit in portas tuas, juxta introitus urbis perruptae; per ungulas equorum suorum conculcabit omnes plateas tuas, xxvi 10, 11:  apud 
Haggaeum,  Evertam thronum regnorum, et perdam robur regnorum gentium, evertam etiam currum, et equitantes eo, et descendent equi et equites eorum, ii 22: </p>
<p>apud Zachariam,  Exscindam currum ex Ephraimo, 
et equum ex Hierosolyma, exscindam arcum belli; contra loquetur pacem gentibus, ix (x)10:  apud Jeremiam,  Aegyptus sicut flumen ascendit, et sicut flumina commoventur aquae ejus, dixit enim, 
Ascendam, obtegam terram, perdam urbem, et habitantes in illa; ascendite equi, insanite currus, xlvi 8, 9. [12] Per `equos' et `currus' quibus Aegyptii persecuti filios Israelis, et cum quibus Pharaoh 
intravit mare Suph, ubi rotae curruum dimovebantur, et per plura de equis et curribus, quae maximam partem descriptionis illius faciunt, Exod. xiv, {20}versibus 6, 7, 9, 17, 23, 25, 26; et xv 4, 19,
