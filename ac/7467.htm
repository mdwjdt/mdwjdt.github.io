<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7467节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7467.</strong>“只是法老却不可再行愚弄，不容百姓去祭祀耶和华”表只要他不以谎言进行欺骗，离开他们，好叫他们在自由中敬拜他们的神。这从“法老”和以色列人的代表，以及“愚弄”、“容去”和“祭祀耶和华”的含义清楚可知：“法老”是指那些沉浸于由邪恶所生的虚假并进行侵扰的人；“愚弄”是指以谎言进行欺骗；“容去”是指离开；以色列人，即此处的“百姓”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人；“祭祀耶和华”是指敬拜他们的神（参看<a href="7393.htm">7393</a>，<a href="7452.htm">7452</a>，<a href="7458.htm">7458</a>节），这必须在自由中完成（<a href="7454.htm">7454</a>，<a href="7456.htm">7456</a>节）。由此明显可知，“只是法老却不可再行愚弄，不容百姓去祭祀耶和华”表示只要他不以谎言进行欺骗，离开那些属于属灵教会的人，好叫他们在自由中敬拜他们的神。</p>

Only let not Pharaoh mock anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah. That this signifies provided he does not deceive by a lie, and does not [fail to] leave them to worship their God 
in freedom, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evils and infest; from the signification of "mocking," as being to deceive by a lie; from the signification 
of "letting go," as being to leave; from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church; and from the signification of "sacrificing to Jehovah," as 
being to worship their God (see n. 7393, 7452, 7458), which must be done in freedom (n. 7454, 7456). From all this it is evident that by "only let not Pharaoh mock anymore in not letting the people go 
to sacrifice to Jehovah," is signified, provided he does not deceive by a lie, and does not [fail to] leave those who are of the spiritual church to worship their God in freedom. </p>

'Only do not let Pharaoh act deceitfully again in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah' means provided that he does not deceive with lies and fail to leave, so that they may worship their 
God in freedom. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those who are steeped in falsities arising from evils and engage in molestation; from the meaning of 'acting deceitfully' as deceiving 
with lies; from the meaning of 'sending away' as leaving; from the representation of the children of Israel, [to whom 'the people' refers here,] as those who belong to the spiritual Church; and 
from the meaning of 'sacrificing to Jehovah' as worshipping their God, dealt with in <a href="7393.htm">7393</a>, <a href="7452.htm">7452</a>, <a href="7458.htm">7458</a>. Which must be done in freedom, see <a href="7454.htm">7454</a>, <a href="7456.htm">7456</a>. From all this it is evident that 'only do not let 
Pharaoh act deceitfully again in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah' means provided that he did not deceive with lies and fail to leave, so that those belonging to the spiritual Church 
may worship their God in freedom. </p>

`Tantum ne addat Pharao illudere, quo minus dimittat populum ad sacrificandum Jehovae': quod significet modo ne per mendacium fallat, et non relinquat ut in libero colant Deum suum, constat ex repraesentatione 
`Pharaonis' quod sint qui in falsis {1}ex malis et infestant; ex significatione `illudere' quod sit per mendacium fallere; ex significatione `dimittere' quod sit relinquere; ex repraesentatione 
`filiorum Israelis' {2} quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali {3}; et ex significatione `sacrificare Jehovae' quod sit colere Deum suum, de qua {4} n. 7393, 7452, 7458; quod erit in libero, videatur 
n. 7454, 7456; ex his patet quod per `tantum ne addat Pharao illudere, quo minus dimittat populum ad sacrificandum Jehovae' significetur modo ne per mendacium fallat, et non relinquat ut illi qui 
ab Ecclesia spirituali colant Deum suum in libero. 	@1 ac$ 	@2 i qui hic sunt populus,$ 	@3 i, de qua saepe prius$ 	@4 i supra$ </p>
