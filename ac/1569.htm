Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1569.</strong> Because their gain was large and they could not live together means that the gains of his inner self were incompatible with gains of his outer self, as is established by the discussion just above. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1569</b></p><p><b>1569.</b>
Because their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. That this signifies that the things that had been acquired by the internal man could not agree with those acquired in the external 
may be seen from what has just been said. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1569</b></p><p><b>1569.</b>
'For their acquisitions were great, and they could not dwell together' means the things that were acquired by the internal man could not agree with those acquired in the external. This becomes clear 
from what has just been stated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1569</b>
</p><b>1569.</b>
'Quia fuit acquisitio illorum magna, et non potuerunt habitare simul': quod significent quae acquisita sunt ab interno homine cum illis quae acquisita in externo non possent concordare, constare potest 
ab illis quae nunc dicta sunt. </p>
