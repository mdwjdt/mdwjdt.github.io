<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2493.</strong>我曾与天使谈论对过去的记忆和对未来的忧虑，我得知，天使越内在、完美，就越不系念过去，不挂虑未来，这也是他们快乐的根源。他们说，主时时刻刻将所思的赐给他们，他们因此无忧无虑。就内义而言，这也是“日日”从天上所得的吗哪、主祷文中“日用的饮食”，以及“不必忧虑吃什么喝什么，也不必忧虑穿什么”这句经文所表示的。不过，尽管天使不挂念过去，不忧虑未来，但他们仍有对过去最完美的记忆和对未来最完美的洞察，因为他们全部的临在里面既包含过去，也包含未来。因此，他们拥有超乎想像或表达的完美记忆。</p>

The nature of the memories is sometimes presented to view in the other life, in forms to be seen there alone. (Many things are there presented to the sight, which in the case of men fall only into the 
ideas.) The exterior memory is thus presented to view as a callosity; the interior memory as a medullary substance such as is in the human brain. From this circumstance it is possible to know of what 
quality the spirits are. With those who in the life of the body have fostered the memory alone, and so have not cultivated their rational, the callosity appears hard, and striated within. With those 
who have filled the memory with falsities, it appears as if made of hair and shaggy, and this from the disorderly mass of things. With those who have fostered the memory for the sake of the love of self 
and of the world, it appears conglutinated and indurated. With those who have desired to penetrate into Divine arcana by things scientific, and especially by things philosophical, and who would not 
believe until persuaded by means of these things, it appears dark, and of such a nature as to absorb the rays of light, and turn them into darkness. With those who have been deceitful and hypocrites, 
it appears as if bony and of ebony,* reflecting the rays of light. But with those who have been in the good of love and the truth of faith, such a callosity does not appear; because their interior memory 
transmits the rays of light into the exterior memory, in the objects or ideas of which-as in their basis or as in their ground-the rays are terminated, and find there delightful receptacles. For 
the exterior memory is the ultimate of order, in which spiritual and heavenly things are softly terminated and reside when there are goods and truths therein. * Ebena, perhaps for eburnea, of ivory, 
as in the Apocalypse Explained, n. 253. [Rotch ed.] </p>

The nature of the interior memory and of the exterior is sometimes presented visually in the next life in forms seen in that world only. (In that world many things are presented visually which with men 
fall into ideas only.) The exterior memory is presented in this manner as thick skin, while the interior memory is presented as a medullary substance like that in the human brain. This is the way in 
which one is enabled to know the nature of each. In the case of people who during their lifetime have been occupied with the memory only and have not in the same way cultivated their rational, the thick 
skin looks to be hard, with deep cracks in it. With those who have filled their memory with falsities it looks rough and hairy, on account of the disordered mess things are in. In the case of those 
who have been occupied with the memory solely for reasons of self-love and love of the world it looks matted and hardened. Among those who wished to penetrate Divine arcana by means of facts, especially 
by means of philosophical speculations, and refused to believe until they were persuaded by means of these, it looks like something dark which is of such a nature that it absorbs rays of light and 
converts them into darkness. With people who have been deceitful and hypocritical it looks like something bony and made of ebony reflecting rays of light. But with those with whom the good of love 
and the truth of faith have been present, no such thick skin is seen because their interior memory is emitting rays of light into the exterior, within whose objects or ideas as their own foundation, or 
as their own ground, the rays terminate and there find delightful vessels to contain them. For the exterior memory is the final limit of order, within which spiritual and celestial things are gently 
terminated and rest when goods and truths are present there. </p>

Quales sunt memoriae, quandoque in altera vita sistitur videndum, in formis ibi solum apparentibus, (ad visum ibi plura sistuntur quae alioquin apud homines `solum cadunt' in ideas.) {1} Memoria exterior 
sistitur ita a apparentiam instar calli, interior instar substantiae medullosae qualis in cerebro humano; inde quoque scire datur quales sunt.  Qui in vita corporis soli memoriae studuerunt, et 
sic rationale suum non excoluerunt, callositas eorum apparet dura, ac intus striata. Qui impleverunt memoriam falsitatibus, apparet capillacea et hirsuta, et hoc ex congerie inordinata rerum.  Qui memoriae 
studuerunt amoris sui et mundi causa, apparet conglutinata et indurata.  Qui per scientifica, imprimis per philosophica, in arcana Divina penetrare voluerunt, nec prius credere quam cum per illa 
persuaderentur, apud eos apparet illa tenebricosa quae talis naturae est ut radios lucis absorbeat et in tenebras vertat.  Qui dolo: et hypocritae fuerunt, apud eos apparet illa sicut ossea et ebena, 
quae reflectit radios lucis.  Qui autem in bono amoris et vero fidei fuerunt, apud eos talis callus non apparet, quia memoria eorum interior lucis radios transmittit in exteriorem, in cujus objectis 
seu ideis, sicut in sua basi aut sicut in sua humo, radii terminantur, et ibi deliciosa receptacula inveniunt; nam memoria exterior est ultimum ordinis, in quo spiritualia et caelestia molliter terminantur 
et resident quando ibi bona et vera. 	@1 A o parentheses.$ </p>
