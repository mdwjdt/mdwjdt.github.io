<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7997节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7997.</strong>逾越节的晚餐代表天上照良善和真理彼此一起生活的天使的组合（参看<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>节）；并且由于它代表这些组合，所以经上规定，在这种场合，不仅每家每户都要单独一起吃，而且除了那些代表诸如属于天堂社群的那种爱的结合之人外，任何人都不可与他们来往。因此，其他人都要分开。要被分开的那些人就是“外邦人”，因为他们表示那些没有教会的良善和真理之人。“寄居的和雇工”也要分开，因为这些人代表那些出于纯粹的属世倾向行良善和真理，并以此夸口的人，以及那些为了物质利益而如此行的人。无论后者还是前者，都不能融入天上的天使当中。不过，在刚刚进入来世、经历良善和真理的荒凉之前的那段时期，他们被允许四处游荡。在这个最初时期，当他们靠近任何一个天上社群，并感受到逾越节羔羊之血所表示的纯真良善（<a href="7846.htm">7846</a>，<a href="7877.htm">7877</a>节）的真理所发出的神圣气场时，便无法靠近，不能再往前走，而是由于恐惧和厌恶而仓皇逃离。</p>

That the paschal supper represented the consociations of angels in the heavens in respect to goods and truths, see above (n. 7836, 7996); and because it represented these, it was ordained that not only 
every house by itself should then be together and eat, but also that no others should be consociated except those who represent the conjunction of love such as is that of the heavenly societies, and 
thus that the rest were to be separated. They who are to be separated were the aliens, for by them were signified those who are not in the good and truth of the church; also the lodgers and hirelings, 
because by these were represented those who from mere natural disposition, and those who for the sake of gain, did good and truth, and made a boast of them. Neither the latter nor the former can be 
consociated with the angels in the heavens; but when they are allowed to wander about, as is the case when they first come into the other life, before they undergo vastations of good and truth, then 
when they come toward any angelic society and feel the sphere of sanctity from the truth of the good of innocence which is signified by the blood of the paschal lamb (n. 7846, 7877), they cannot approach, 
but forthwith flee away because of fear and aversion. </p>

The Passover supper represented the groups of angels in heaven living in association with one another according to their forms of good and truths, see above in <a href="7836.htm">7836</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>. And since it represented those 
groups it was decreed not only that each household should be together by itself to eat it on that occasion but also that none should be associated with them except those who could represent togetherness 
in love characteristic of heavenly communities. All others were to be set apart. Those to be set apart were 'foreigners', possession of the Church's goodness and truth. Those to be set apart also 
'strangers' and 'hired servants', since these represented people prompted by natural inclination alone and people seeking material gain who would make a show of doing what was good and true. None of 
these can be integrated among the angels in heaven. But they are allowed to wander around during the initial period after their arrival in the next life, before they undergo the stages of vastation 
of good and truth. When during that initial period they approach any heavenly community and sense the sphere of holiness emanating from the truth belonging to the good of innocence, meant by 'the blood 
of the Passover lamb', <a href="7846.htm">7846</a>, <a href="7877.htm">7877</a>, they can go no further but in fear and loathing make a hasty retreat.  </p>

Quod cena paschalis repraesentaverit consociationes angelorum in caelis quoad bona et vera, videatur supra n. 7836, 7996, et quia illas repraesentabat, ordinatum est {1}ut non modo unaquaevis domus 
per se tunc simul esset et comederet, sed etiam quod non alii consociarentur quam qui repraesentarent conjunctionem amoris, qualis est societatum caelestium, et sic quod reliqui {2} separarentur; qui 
separarentur erant `alienigenae,' nam per illos {3}significabantur qui non in bono et vero Ecclesiae, tum `inquilini (c)et mercenarii,' quia per illos repraesentabantur qui ex sola indole naturali, et 
qui propter lucra facerent et venditarent bonum et verum; hi et illi {4}non consociari possunt cum angelis in caelis, sed cum illis licet circumvagari, quod fit (x)primo tempore adventus illorum in alteram 
vitam, antequam subeunt vastationes boni et veri, tunc cum ad aliquam societatem angelicam veniunt ac sentiunt sphaeram sanctitatis ex vero boni innocentiae, quod significatur per `sanguinem agni 
paschatis,' n. 7846, 7877,' non possunt appropinquare sed ex timore et aversatione confestim aufugiunt. 	@1 i non modo quod$ 	@2 i abinde$ 	@3 significantur$ 	@4 nec$ </p>
