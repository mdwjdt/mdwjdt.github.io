<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6371节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6371.</strong>“权杖必不离犹大”表权柄和掌控必不离开属天国度。这从“离”和“权杖”的含义，以及“犹大”的代表清楚可知：“离”是指离开；“权杖”是指权柄和掌控，尤指真理通过良善的权柄和掌控（参看<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>e节），因为权杖是王权和掌控的象征，而王权表示真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）；“犹大”是指属天国度（<a href="6363.htm">6363</a>节）。由此明显可知，“权杖必不离犹大”表权柄和掌控必不离开属天国度。<br />从字义来看，本节经文的内容似乎是说，王国必不离开犹太人，直到主来。这也是事实，然而，这一历史事实和其它历史一样，含有一个内义。因为王国必不离开犹太人，直到主来，这完全是世俗的事；但当人将“权杖”理解为权柄和掌控，将“犹大”理解为属天国度时，属于内义的属灵内容就显而易见了。然而，当主到来时，权柄和掌控就会离开属天国度，这个观点是一个奥秘；若不通过启示，没有人能明白。这奥秘乃是这样：在主降世之前，世人和灵人当中有一个从耶和华或主经由属天国度，也就是经由属天国度的天使而来的流注。这就是那时他们权柄的源头。但当主降世，并由此使祂里面的人身变成神性时，祂就为自己取得属天国度的天使所掌握的东西，即权柄和掌控。因为从神流入并经过那天堂的东西直到那时一直是神性人身（Divine Human）。这流注也是当耶和华以这种方式显现时呈现祂自己的神性人（Divine Man）。但当主亲自将祂自己里面的人身变成神性时，这神性人身就结束了。由此可见，这奥秘是怎么回事。诚然，属天国度的天使仍行使很大的权柄和掌控，但仅在他们通过对主之爱而在主的神性人身的范围之内。关于这些问题，可参看前面的阐述和说明（参看<a href="1990.htm">1990</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3061.htm">3061</a>，<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>，<a href="4687.htm">4687</a>，<a href="5110.htm">5110</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>节）。</p>

The scepter shall not be removed from Judah. That this signifies that sovereignty shall not depart from the celestial kingdom, is evident from the signification of "being removed," as being to depart; 
from the signification of "scepter," as being sovereignty, and indeed the sovereignty of truth from good (see n. 4876), for a scepter is a badge of royal power, and by royalty is signified truth (n. 
1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4575, 6148); and from the representation of Judah, as being the celestial kingdom (n. 6363). Hence it is plain that by the "scepter not being removed from Judah" is signified 
that the sovereignty shall not depart from the celestial kingdom. [2] From the sense of the letter it appears that by what is contained in this verse is meant that the kingdom should not be removed 
from the Jewish people until the Lord came. This also is true, yet in this historic truth, as in everything else, there is an internal sense; for that the kingdom should not be removed from the Jewish 
people, is a worldly matter; but the spiritual truth of the internal sense appears when by "scepter" is understood sovereignty, and by "Judah" the celestial kingdom. But that sovereignty should 
depart from the celestial kingdom when the Lord came, is a secret that no one can know except from revelation. The case is this. Before the coming of the Lord into the world, there was influx of life 
with men and with spirits from Jehovah or the Lord through the celestial kingdom, that is, through the angels who were in that kingdom, and hence they then had the sovereignty. But when the Lord came 
into the world, and thereby made the Human in Himself Divine, He put on just that which was with the angels of the celestial kingdom, thus He put on this sovereignty. For previously the Divine transflux 
through that heaven had been the Divine Human; it was also the Divine Man which was presented to view when Jehovah so appeared; but this Divine Human ceased when the Lord Himself made the Human in 
Himself Divine. This shows how the case is with this secret. The angels of that kingdom have indeed great sovereignty now, but only insofar as they are in the Lord's Divine Human through love to Him. 
(See what has already been stated and shown, n. 1990, 2803, 3061, 4180, 4687, 5110, 6280.) </p>

'The sceptre will not be removed from Judah' means that power and control will not depart from the celestial kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'being removed' as departing; from the meaning 
of 'the sceptre' as power and control, in particular the power and control of truth from good, dealt with in <a href="4876.htm">4876</a> (end), for the sceptre is an emblem of royal power and control, and truth is meant by 
royal power, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="6148.htm">6148</a>; and from the representation of' Judah' as the celestial kingdom, dealt with above in <a href="6763.htm">6763</a>. From all this it is evident that 'the sceptre will not 
be removed from Judah' means that power and control will not depart from the celestial kingdom. </p>

 Viewed from the sense of the letter the contents of this verse will be seen to mean that the kingdom 
was not going to be removed from the Jewish people before the Lord came. That understanding of the verse is quite correct; but even so, this historical consideration, like every other, has an inner 
meaning. For the removal of the kingdom from the Jewish people when the Lord came is a worldly matter; but the spiritual content that belongs to the inner meaning is evident when one understands power 
and control by 'the sceptre' and the celestial kingdom by 'Judah'. Yet the notion that power and control would depart from the celestial kingdom when the Lord came is an arcanum that no one can know 
unless it is revealed to him. And what that arcanum entails is this: Prior to the Lord's Coming into the world there was among men and among spirits an influx of life from Jehovah or the Lord which 
came by way of the celestial kingdom, that is, through the angels who were in that kingdom. This was the source of their power at that time. But when the Lord came into the world, and by so doing made 
the Human within Himself Divine, He took to Himself what had rested with angels of the celestial kingdom, namely that power and control. For what flowed from God and passed through that heaven had until 
then been the Divine human.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> That influx was also the Divine Person who presented Himself, when Jehovah revealed Himself in this way. But this Divine human came to an end when the Lord made the Human 
within Himself Divine. From this one may now see what this arcanum entails. Angels of that kingdom do, it is true, still exercise great power and control, but only in the measure that the Lord's 
Divine Human resides in them through their love for Him.

`Non removebitur sceptrum a Jehudah':  quod significet quod non potestas recedet a regno caelesti, constat a significatione `removeri' quod sit recedere; ex significatione `sceptri' quod sit potestas, 
et quidem potestas veri ex bono, de qua n. 4876 fin., nam sceptrum est insigne regiae potestatis, et per `regium' significatur verum, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4575, 6148; et a repraesentatione 
`Jehudae' quod sit regnum caeleste, de qua supra n. 6363; inde patet quod per `non removebitur sceptrum a Jehudah' significetur quod non potestas recedet a regno caelesti.  [2]Ex sensu litterae apparet 
quod per illa quae in hoc versu continentur, intelligatur quod regnum non {1}removeretur a populo Judaico antequam Dominus veniret; hoc quoque est verum sed usque in hoc historico, sicut in {2}ceteris, 
sensus internus est, nam quod {3}a populo Judaico tunc removeretur regnum, mundanum est; spirituale autem quod est sensus interni, patet cum per `sceptrum' intelligitur potestas, et per `Jehudam' 
regnum caeleste.  At quod potestas (t)tunc recederet a regno caelesti cum venturus Dominus, est arcanum quod nemo scire potest nisi ex revelatione; cum illo se ita habet:  ante Adventum Domini in 
mundum, fuit {4} influxus vitae apud homines et apud spiritus a Jehovah seu Domino per regnum caeleste, hoc est, per angelos qui in illo regno fuerunt, inde illis tunc potestas; at cum Dominus in mundum 
venit, per quod Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, induit id ipsum quod fuit apud angelos regni caelestis, ita potestatem illam; nam transfluxus Divinus per (t)illud caelum fuerat prius {5}(t)Humanum Divinum; 
erat etiam Divinus Homo, Qui sistebatur cum Jehovah {6}ita apparuit; ast hoc (t)Humanum Divinum cessavit, cum Dominus Ipse Humanum in Se Divinum fecit; inde patet quomodo se cum hoc arcano habet; 
nunc quidem angelis istius regni {7}est magna potestas, sed quantum in Divino Humano Domini sunt per amorem in Ipsum; videantur quae de his prius, n. 1990, 2803, 3061, 4180, 4687, 5110, 6280, dicta 
et ostensa sunt. @1 removebitur$ @2 singulis aliis$ @3 populus Judaicus tunc exueretur Regno$ @4 i omnis$ @5 This transposition is explained in n. 2814$ @6 before sistebatur$ @7 before angelis$ </p>
