<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5118.</strong>“法老的杯在我手中”表内层属世层进入外层属世层的流注，以及接受的开始。这从“法老”和“酒政”的代表，以及“杯”的含义清楚可知：“法老”是指内层属世层，如前所述（<a href="5080.htm">5080</a>，<a href="5095.htm">5095</a>节）；“酒政”是指外层属世层（<a href="5077.htm">5077</a>，<a href="5082.htm">5082</a>节），“我手”是指酒政的；“杯”是指盛纳之物，同时也指被盛纳之物，如下文所述（<a href="5120.htm">5120</a>节）。从这些意义和内义上的思路可知，“法老的杯在我手中”表示内层属世层进入外层属世层的流注，以及在那里接受的开始。至于何为内层属世层，何为外层属世层，这在前面已经阐明，即：内层属世层是那与理性层相通，并且理性层流入其中的，外层属世层则是那与感官相通，也就是通过感官与世界相通，因而世界流入其中的。<br />至于流注，它从主开始，经由理性层不断延伸至内层属世层，然后经由内层属世层进入外层属世层；不过，所流入之物照着它被接受的方式而被改变和转化。对未重生的人来说，一切良善在那里被转化为邪恶，一切真理被转化为虚假；但对重生之人来说，良善与真理在那里如同在一面镜子中呈现出来。因为属世层无非是一张脸，是内在人的属灵事物的代表；当外层与内层相对应时，这张脸变得具有代表性。由此可对何谓内层属世层进入外层属世层的流注，以及在那里接受的开始获得某种概念。</p>

And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand. That this signifies the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the 
interior natural (of which above, n. 5080, 5095); and from the representation of the butler, as being the exterior natural (n. 5077, 5082); "in my hand" meaning with him; and from the signification of 
a "cup," as being that which contains, and also at the same time that which is contained (of which in what follows, n. 5120). Hence, and from the series of things in the internal sense, by "Pharaoh's 
cup was in my hand" is signified the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception therein. What the interior natural is, and what the exterior, has been stated above, 
namely, that the interior natural is that which communicates with the rational and into which the rational flows, and the exterior natural is that which communicates with the senses, or through them 
with the world, thus into which the world flows. As regards influx, it is continuous from the Lord through the rational into the interior natural, and through this into the exterior; but that which 
flows in is changed and turned according to the reception. With the unregenerate, goods are there turned into evils, and truths into falsities; but with the regenerate, goods and truths are there presented 
as in a mirror. For the natural is like a face representative of the spiritual things of the internal man; and this face becomes representative when the exteriors correspond to the interiors. 
From this it may in some measure appear what is meant by the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and by the beginning of reception therein. </p>

'And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand' means an influx of the interior natural into the exterior natural, and the beginning of reception. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the interior 
natural, dealt with above in <a href="5080.htm">5080</a>, <a href="5095.htm">5095</a>; from the representation of 'the cupbearer' as the exterior natural, dealt with in <a href="5077.htm">5077</a>, <a href="5082.htm">5082</a> - 'my hand' being the cupbearer's; from the meaning of 'cup' as 
that which contains, and also at the same time that which is contained in it, dealt with below in <a href="5120.htm">5120</a>. From these meanings and from the train of thought in the internal sense 'Pharaoh's cup was in my 
hand' means the influx of the interior natural into the exterior natural, and the beginning of reception there. What the interior natural and the exterior natural are has been stated already - the interior 
natural is that which communicates with the rational and into which the rational enters, while the exterior natural is that which communicates with the senses, that is, through the senses with 
the world, and so that which the world flows into. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards influx, this begins with the Lord and extends continuously through the rational into the interior natural and then through this into 
the exterior natural; but what flows through undergoes change and is converted according to the way it is received. With those who are not regenerate all good is converted there into evil, and all truth 
into falsity; but with those who are regenerate all good and truth presents itself there as in a mirror. For the natural is nothing else than a face so to speak that is representative of spiritual 
characteristics of the internal man; and the face becomes representative when exteriors correspond to interiors. From this one may gain some idea of what is meant by an influx of the interior natural 
into the exterior natural, and the beginning of reception there. </p>

`Et scyphus Pharaonis in manu mea':  quod significet influxum interioris naturalis in exterius, et receptionis initium, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit interius naturale, de qua 
supra n. 5080, 5095; ex repraesentatione `pincernae' quod sit exterius naturale, de qua n. 5077, 5082; `in manu mea' est apud eum; ex significatione `scyphi' quod sit id quod continet, et quoque simul 
id quod continetur, de qua in {1}sequente n. 5120; </p>
<p>inde et ex serie rerum in sensu interno, {2}per scyphum Pharaonis in manu mea, significatur influxus interioris naturalis in exterius, et receptionis 
initium {3}ibi. Quid naturale interius et naturale exterius, prius dictum est, quod nempe naturale interius sit id quod communicat cum rationali, et in quod rationale influit, naturale autem 
exterius id quod communicat cum sensualibus, seu per sensualia cum mundo, ita in quod mundus influit. {4}Quod influxum attinet, is est continuus a Domino per rationale in naturale interius et per 
hoc in exterius, sed quae influunt, mutantur et vertuntur secundum receptionem; apud non regeneratos vertuntur ibi bona in mala, et vera in falsa; at apud regeneratos sistuntur ibi bona et vera sicut 
in speculo; naturale enim nihil aliud est quam sicut facies repraesentativa spiritualium quae {5}interni hominis; </p>
<p>et tunc {6}facies illa fit repraesentativa {7}, cum exteriora correspondent interioribus; 
inde aliquatenus constare potest quid intelligitur per influxum interioris naturalis in exterius, et per receptionis initium ibi. @1 sequentibus$ @2 continens est$ @3 Before receptionis$ @4
