<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4156节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4156.</strong>“把它们放在骆驼的稻草里”表在记忆知识中。这从“骆驼的稻草”的含义清楚可知，“骆驼的稻草”是指这类知识（<a href="3114.htm">3114</a>节）。它们之所以被称作“稻草”，既因为稻草是骆驼的食物，还因为相对于理性概念，记忆知识是粗糙的，缺乏秩序。由于这个原因，记忆知识也以“缠连的树枝”和“森林的密丛”（<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>节）来表示。“骆驼”表示属于属世人的一般记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节）。<br />如前所述，相对于理性概念，记忆知识是粗糙的，缺乏秩序，故以“稻草”，以及“密丛或缠连的树枝”来表示。这个观念对那些唯独仰赖记忆知识，并因此号称博学的人来说并不明显。这些人以为人知道得越多，或拥有的记忆知识越多，就越有智慧。但真实情况截然不同，这一点已通过来世那些在世时唯独仰赖记忆知识，并由此获得博学名声的人向我清楚显明了，因为他们有时比那些在记忆知识上没有任何技能的人还要愚蠢。这种愚蠢的原因也向我透露了，即：记忆知识其实是变得智慧的一种手段，但也有可能成为变得疯狂的一种手段。对过着良善生活的人来说，记忆知识是变得智慧的一种手段；但对过着邪恶生活的人来说，它们却是变得疯狂的一种手段；因为他们利用记忆知识不仅确认其邪恶的生活，还确认虚假原则，并且在做这种事时还自大傲慢、具有说服力，因为他们自以为比别人更有智慧。<br />这会导致其理性的毁灭。因为具有理性者，并不是那能凭记忆知识推理，甚至有时以看似比其他人更驾轻就熟的方式进行推理的人。他所拥有的这种技能是纯幻光的产物。但是，能清楚看到良善就是良善，真理就是真理，因而清楚看到邪恶就是邪恶，虚假就是虚假的人，才真正富有理性。相反，视良善为邪恶，视邪恶为良善的人，以及视真理为虚假，视虚假为真理的人则决称不上有理性，倒称得上没有理性，无论他多么能推理。对于清楚看到良善就是良善，真理就是真理，反过来又能清楚看到邪恶就是邪恶，虚假就是虚假的人来说，光从天堂流入，并照亮其理解或认知功能，使得他以其理解或认知所看到的理由成为那光的众多光线。这光还照亮记忆知识，使它们确认真理，此外还把它们整理得井然有序，并排列成天堂的形式。然而，反对良善与真理的人，和所有过着邪恶生活的人一样，不允许天堂之光进入。相反，他们唯独以自己的幻光为乐，其性质是这样：他们看东西时，就像黑暗里的人看墙上的斑点和条纹，并幻想用它们制作各种形状；而事实上，它们并非真正的形状，因为当日光照进来时，就会发现它们无非是斑点和条纹而已。<br />由此可见，记忆知识既可成为变得智慧的一种手段，也可成为变得疯狂的一种手段；也就是说，它们要么是完善理性的手段，要么是摧毁理性的手段。因此，在来世，那些通过这类知识摧毁理性的人远比那些并不通晓它们的人愚蠢得多。相对于理性概念，这些知识很粗糙，这一点从以下事实明显可知：它们属于属世人或外在人；而通过它们所培育的理性属于属灵人或内在人。从前面关于两种记忆的阐述和说明（<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>节）可以得知，就纯洁而言，这些知识与理性何等不同，又何等相去甚远。</p>

And put them in the camel's straw. That this signifies in memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of the "camel's straw," as being such knowledges (n. 3114). They are called "straw," both 
because this is the food of a camel, and because they are relatively gross and devoid of order. For this reason memory-knowledges are also signified by "thickets" of trees and of the forest (n. 2831). 
(That "camels" denote the general memory-knowledges which are of the natural man, may be seen above, n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145.) [2] That memory-knowledges are relatively gross and devoid of order, 
and are therefore signified by "straw," and also by "thickets," is not apparent to those who are in mere memory-knowledges, and are on this account reputed learned. These believe that the more a man 
knows, or the more memory-knowledge he possesses, the wiser he is. But that the case is very different has been made evident to me from those in the other life who when they had lived in the world had 
been in mere memory-knowledges, and thereby had gained the name and reputation of being learned, for they are sometimes more stupid than those who have no such skill in memory- knowledges. The reason 
of this has also been disclosed, namely, that memory-knowledges are indeed a means of becoming wise, but are also a means of becoming insane. To those who are in the life of good, memory-knowledges 
are a means of becoming wise; but to those who are in a life of evil, they are a means of becoming insane; for by means of memory-knowledges these persons confirm not only their life of evil, but also 
principles of falsity, and this arrogantly and with persuasion, because they believe themselves to be wiser than others.  [3] From this it comes to pass that they destroy their rational; for it is not 
the man who can reason from memory-knowledges, even when he can apparently do so in a more lofty manner than others, who is in the enjoyment of the rational faculty; for this skill is the result of 
a mere fatuous light. But that man excels in the rational who is able clearly to see that good is good, and truth truth, consequently that evil is evil, and falsity falsity; whereas the man who regards 
good as evil and evil as good, and also the man who regards truth as falsity and falsity as truth, can by no means be said to be rational, but rather, irrational, however able he may be to reason. 
With him who clearly sees that good is good and that truth is truth, and on the other hand that evil is evil and falsity is falsity, light flows in from heaven, and enlightens his intellectual faculty, 
and causes the reasons which he sees in his understanding to be so many rays of that light. The same light also illuminates the memory-knowledges, so that they confirm the truth, and moreover disposes 
them into order and into heavenly form. But they who are against good and truth, as are all who are in the life of evil, do not admit that heavenly light, but are delighted solely with their own fatuous 
light, the nature of which is to see as one who in the dark beholds spots and streaks on a wall, and out of them fancifully makes all kinds of figures, which however are not really figures, for 
when the light of day is let in, it is seen that they are nothing but spots and streaks. [4] From all this we can see that memory-knowledges are a means of becoming wise, and also a means of becoming 
insane; that is, that they are a means of perfecting the rational, and also a means of destroying the rational. In the other life therefore they who by means of such knowledges have destroyed their rational, 
are much more stupid than they who have not been versed in them. That these knowledges are relatively gross, is manifest from their belonging to the natural or external man; whereas the rational, 
which is cultivated by their means, belongs to the spiritual or internal man. How far these differ and are distant the one from the other in regard to purity, may be known from what has been said 
and shown concerning the two memories (n. 2469-2494). </p>

'And put them in the camel's straw' means in facts. This is clear from the meaning of 'the camel's straw' as facts, <a href="3114.htm">3114</a>. These are called straw not only because straw is the food for camels but also 
because facts, compared with rational ideas, are coarse and lacking in order. For the same reason too facts are meant by 'the entangled boughs of trees and of the wood', <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>. Also 'camels' means general 
facts that belong to the natural man, see <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As to the assertion that facts, compared with rational ideas, are coarse and lacking in order and for that reason are meant 
by 'straw' and also by 'entangled boughs', as has been stated, this idea is not open to those who rely solely on facts and are on that account reputed to be learned. They believe that the amount a person 
knows, that is, how much knowledge he possesses, determines how wise he is. But the situation is quite different, as has been made clear to me from those in the next life who, when they lived in 
the world, relied solely on facts and as a result acquired a name and reputation for being learned. Such people are sometimes far more stupid than those who have not possessed any skill in the use of 
factual knowledge. The reason for that stupidity has also been disclosed to me, which is this: Facts are indeed a means towards becoming wise, but they can also be a means towards becoming insane. For 
people who are leading a good life facts are a means to becoming wise, but for those leading an evil life they are a means to becoming insane since they use facts to support not only a life of evil 
but also false assumptions, which they do arrogantly and convincingly because they believe that they are wiser than others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This leads to the destruction of their rational. It is not the person 
who is able to reason from facts, doing so sometimes in a seemingly more masterly way than others, who is endowed with rationality. This skill which he possesses is the product of a wholly illusory light. 
But that person has the proper gift of rationality who is able to see clearly that good is good and truth is truth, and as a consequence that evil is evil and falsity is falsity. But anyone who 
looks on good as evil and on evil as good, and who also looks on truth as falsity and falsity as truth, cannot in any sense be called rational, but rather irrational, no matter how capable he is at reasoning. 
With the person who sees clearly that good is good and that truth is truth, and conversely that evil is evil and falsity is falsity, there is light flowing in from heaven and enlightening the 
area of his understanding and causing reasons which he sees with the understanding to be just so many rays of that light. The same light also gives light to facts so that they serve to support those 
reasons, besides imposing order and the heavenly form on such facts. People however who stand opposed to good and truth, as all do who are leading an evil life, do not allow that heavenly light in. Instead 
they take delight solely in their own illusory light, whose nature is such that one sees things rather like a person in the dark who sees streaks on a wall, and is deluded into making all kinds 
of shapes out of them, when yet they are not shapes, for as daylight falls on them they are seen to be merely streaks. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this it may be seen that facts are a means to becoming wise and also 
a means to becoming insane; that is, that they are a means to perfecting the rational or else a means to destroying it. Those therefore who have destroyed the rational by means of facts are in the 
next life far more stupid than those who have not possessed any skill in the use of factual knowledge. The coarseness of facts compared with rational ideas is evident from the consideration that they 
belong to the natural or external man, and that the rational which is cultivated by means of them belongs to the spiritual or internal man. How far facts are different from and distant from the rational 
as regards purity can be known from what has been stated and shown about the two memories in <a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>. </p>

`Et posuit illos in stramento cameli': quod significet quod in scientificis, constat ex significatione `stramenti cameli' quod sint scientifica, n. 3114; stramentum vocantur, tam quia cibus camelis 
quam quia crassa et inordinata (o)sunt respective; ideo etiam scientifica significantur per `implexa arborum et {1} silvae,' n. 2831; quod `cameli' sint scientifica communia quae naturalis hominis, 
videatur n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145.  [2] Quod scientifica sint crassa et inordinata respective et ideo significentur per `stramentum,' et quoque per `implexa,' ut dictum, non apparet coram illis 
qui in solis scientificis sunt, et inde audiunt eruditi; credunt hi quod quantum homo scit, seu quantum scientiae possidet, tantum sapiat; sed quod aliter se res habeat, constare mihi potuit ab illis 
in altera vita, qui `dum vixerunt in mundo', in solis scientificis fuerunt {2}, et inde captarunt (t)nomen et famam eruditi, quod quandoque multo stupidiores sint illis qui nullas scientias calluerunt; 
causa quoque detecta est quod nempe scientifica sint quidem media sapiendi, sed quod etiam sint [media] insaniendi; qui in vita boni sunt, illis sunt scientifica media sapiendi, sed qui in 
vita mali sunt, illis sunt illa media insaniendi, nam per scientifica confirmant non solum vitam mali, sed etiam principia falsi, et hoc arroganter et cum persuasione, quia se credunt sapere prae 
aliis; inde fit quod rationale suum destruant; [3] rationali enim non gaudet is qui ex scientificis ratiocinari potest, et quandoque ad apparentiam sublimius quam alii; est modo fatuum lumen quod 
solertiam illam producit; sed is rationali pollet qui perspicere potest quod bonum sit bonum et verum verum, proinde quod malum sit malum et falsum falsum; at qui bonum spectat ut malum, et malum ut 
bonum, tum qui verum ut falsum et falsum ut verum, is neutiquam dici potest rationalis sed potius irrationalis, utcumque potest ratiocinari; </p>
<p>apud illum qui perspicue videt quod bonum sit bonum, et 
quod verum sit verum, et vicissim quod malum sit malum et falsum sit falsum, influit lux e caelo et intellectuale ejus illustrat, et facit ut rationes quas intellectu videt, sint totidem radii lucis 
illius; </p>
<p>eadem lux {3} quoque illuminat scientifica ut confirment, ac praeterea disponit illa in ordinem ac in formam caelestem; qui autem contra bonum et verum sunt, ut sunt omnes qui in vita mali, lucem 
illam caelestem non admittunt, sed solum delectantur lumine suo fatuo, quod talis naturae {4} est ut videat, sicut qui in tenebris maculares strias videt in pariete, et inde per phantasias facit 
omnis generis imagines, quae tamen non imagines sunt, nam superveniente luce diei apparet quod solum maculares striae sint.  [4] Inde constare potest quod scientifica sint media sapiendi et quoque 
sint media insaniendi; hoc est quod sint media rationale perficiendi, et sint media rationale destruendi; qui itaque rationale destruxerunt per scientifica, illi in altera vita multo stupidiores 
sunt illis qui nullas scientias calluerunt.  Quod scientifica sint crassa respective, patet ex eo quod sint naturalis seu externi hominis, et quod rationale quod per illa excolitur, sit spiritualis 
seu interni hominis; quantum illa inter se differunt (c)et distant quoad puritatem, sciri potest ex illis quae de binis memoriis n. 2469-2494 dicta et ostensa sunt.      @1 seu$      @2 i
