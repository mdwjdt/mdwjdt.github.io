<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第809节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>809.</strong>“凡在土地面上的”表上古教会的后代。这一点从“土地”的含义明显可知。如前所述，土地是教会，因此是属于教会的一切。经上说“凡在土地面上的一切实体”都被“除灭了”，意思是说，凡属上古教会，且具有这种秉性之人都被毁灭了。此处经上说的是“土地”，而21节说的是“地”，因为教会从不论及觉知之物，而是论及意愿之物。构成教会或教会成员的，绝不是知识和理性，也就是信的部分，而是属于意愿的仁爱。一切本质元素皆出自意愿，因此，教义不构成教会，除非它关注仁爱，无论总体还是细节。因为在这种情况下，仁爱就变成目的。所着眼的目的决定了教义的性质，无论它是否属于教会。主的教会就象主在天堂的王国，无非是由爱与仁构成的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]809.</strong> The symbolism of that was on the face of the ground as the descendants of the earliest church is established by the symbolism of the ground as the church and so as everything that belongs to the church. This has already been detailed [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_809/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_386" target=_top>386</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_809/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566-567</a>]. Since the verse describes substance that was on the face of the ground as being obliterated, the meaning is that the people in the earliest church who were like this were wiped out.<br />The word ground is used here, but the word earth in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_809/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_21" target=_top>21</a> above, because intellectual traits are never described as being the church; only qualities of the will are. A bare knowledge of faith and reasoning that supports faith does not in the least constitute the church or a member of the church. Charity in the will does. Every essential quality comes from the will. As a result, doctrinal concepts also do not make the church unless they look to charity in their whole and in every part. When they do this, charity becomes the purpose, and the purpose behind a doctrinal concept is what reveals its quality — whether it really embodies the church or not.<br />The Lord's church, like his kingdom in the heavens, consists solely of love and charity. </p>

That was upon the faces of the ground. That this signifies the posterity of the Most Ancient Church, is evident from the signification of "ground" (of which before) as being the church, and therefore 
what is of the church. Here, as "every substance that was upon the faces of the ground" is said to be "destroyed" the meaning is that they who were of the Most Ancient Church, and were of such a character, 
were destroyed. Here it is said, "ground" though in the twenty-first verse it is said, "earth" for the reason that the church is never predicated of things of the understanding, but of things of 
the will. Religious knowledge and its attendant rational convictions [scientificum et rationale fidei] by no means constitute the church or man of the church, but charity, which is of the will. All 
that is essential comes from the will; and consequently neither does what is doctrinal make the church, unless both in general and in particular it looks to charity, for then charity becomes the end. 
From the end it is evident what kind of doctrine it is, and whether it is of the church or not. The church of the Lord, like the kingdom of the Lord in the heavens, consists of nothing but love and charity. </p>

'Which was on the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground' means the descendants of the Most Ancient Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the ground', dealt with already, as the Church and therefore as what belongs 
to the Church. Here, because it is said that [every] being<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 'on the face' of the ground' was wiped out, the meaning is that people belonging to the Most Ancient Church who were of that kind were wiped 
out. Here it is called 'the ground', but in verse 21 above 'the earth', the reason being that the Church is never referred to as such because of things of the understanding but because of those of 
the will. Factual knowledge and rational conviction that are part of faith in no way constitute the Church or the member of the Church, but charity which belongs to the will. Every essential element 
comes from the will. Nor therefore does anything doctrinal make the Church unless generally and specifically it has regard to charity, in which case charity becomes the end in view. The end in view determines 
the true character of doctrine, and whether or not it belongs to the Church. As with the Lord's kingdom in the heavens love and charity alone constitute the Lord's Church.

</p><b>809.</b>
'Quae super faciebus humi': quod significet posteritatem Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, constat ex significatione 'humi,' de qua prius, quod sit Ecclesia, et inde quod est Ecclesiae; hic quia substantia dicitur 
'deleta quae super faciebus humi,' est quod deleti qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia et tales fuerunt; 'humus' hic dicitur, in vers. praec. 21 'terra,' ex causa quia Ecclesia nusquam praedicatur ex 
intellectualibus, sed ex voluntariis; scientificum et rationale fidei nusquam constituit Ecclesiam aut hominem Ecclesiae, sed charitas quae est voluntatis; omne essentiale a voluntate venit; proinde nec 
doctrinale facit Ecclesiam, si non doctrinale in genere et in specie spectet charitatem; tunc charitas fit finis; ex fine constat quale doctrinale, num sit Ecclesiae vel non: Ecclesia Domini, sicut 
regnum Domini in caelis, non est nisi amoris et charitatis. </p>
