<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1989节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1989.</strong>“亚伯兰”表处于那种状态和那个年龄的主。这从前面有关亚伯兰的论述清楚可知。就内义而言，亚伯兰代表主，因为当在圣言中被提及时，亚伯兰在天堂并不表示其他人。那些出身于教会，从圣言听说过亚伯兰的人进入来世后，虽然知道他，但由于亚伯兰和其他人没什么两样，并不能给予他们任何帮助，所以他们也就不再对他感兴趣。并且，他们得知，在圣言中，“亚伯兰”只用来表示主。事实上，拥有天堂观念的天使不会形成任何人类的形像，他们对亚伯兰一无所知。所以，当世人阅读圣言，并且亚伯兰被提及时，他们只理解为主。当我们阅读现在这句经文时，他们理解为处于那种状态和那个年龄的主。因为此处耶和华正和亚伯兰，亦即主说话。</p>

That "Abram" signifies the Lord in that state and at that age, is evident from what has already been said concerning Abram. In the internal sense Abram represents the Lord, for when he is mentioned in 
the Word no other Abram is understood in heaven. Those who have been born within the church, and have heard about Abram from the Word, on their entrance into the other life do indeed have some knowledge 
of him; but as he is like any other man, and cannot render them any aid, they no longer care about him; and they are informed that by "Abram" in the Word there is meant no other than the Lord. But 
the angels, who are in heavenly ideas and do not fix them on any man, know nothing about Abram; and therefore when the Word is being read by man and Abram is mentioned they perceive no other than the 
Lord; and when the words now before us are read, they perceive the Lord in that state and at that age; for Jehovah here speaks with Abram, that is, with the Lord. </p>

That 'Abram' means the Lord in that state and at that age is clear from what has been stated already about Abram. In the internal sense Abram represents the Lord, for when mentioned in the Word no other 
Abram is meant in heaven. People who have been born inside the Church and have heard of him from the Word do indeed know of Abram when they enter the next life, but because he is no different from 
any other human being and cannot be of any help to them, they are no longer interested in him. Furthermore they are informed that in the Word 'Abram' has been used to mean no one other than the Lord. 
Indeed angels, who possess heavenly ideas but form no image of any man with them, know nothing at all about Abram. Consequently when the Word is read by man and Abram is mentioned they perceive no one 
other than the Lord. And in the statement made here they perceive the Lord passing through that state and that age, for here Jehovah is talking to Abram, that is, to the Lord. </p>

</p><b>1989.</b>
`Abram': quod significet Dominum in illo statu et in illa aetate, constat ex illis quae prius de Abramo dicta sunt: Abram in sensu interno repraesentat Dominum, nam alius Abram cum nominatur in Verbo, 
in caelo non intelligitur: quid Abram, quidem illi qui intra Ecclesiam nati sunt et audiverunt ex Verbo de illo, cum veniunt in alteram vitam, norunt, sed quia est sicut alius, nec quicquam auxilii 
eis ferre potest, non amplius curant; et informantur quod per `Abramum' in Verbo nullus alius intellectus sit quam Dominus; angeli vero qui in caelestibus ideis sunt, et non illas figunt in aliquo {1} 
homine, prorsus ignorant Abramum, quare dum legitur ab homine Verbum et nominatur Abram, non alium quam Dominum percipiunt, et ad haec verba, Dominum in illo statu et in illa aetate, nam hic Jehovah 
loquitur cum Abramo, hoc est, cum Domino. 	@1 quodam.$ </p>
