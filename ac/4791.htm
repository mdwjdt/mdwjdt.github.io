<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于与大人的对应（续）</h4><br />此处关于味觉和舌头，以及脸与大人的对应关系<br />【节】4791.舌头提供了通向肺和胃的入口，因而可以说代表了通向属灵和属天事物的前院；之所以通向属灵事物，是因为它服务于肺，并由此服务于言语；之所以通向属天事物，是因为它服务于向血液和心脏供应养分的胃。因为肺对应于属灵事物，心对应于属天事物（参看<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>节）。所以，一般来说，舌头对应于对真理的情感，或对应于大人中那些处于对真理的情感，后来处于对源自真理的良善的情感之人。因此，那些热爱主的圣言，渴望从圣言获得良善与真理的知识之人就属于这个区域。然而，他们彼此不同，因为有的属于舌头本身，有的属于喉和气管，有的属于咽喉，有的也属于牙龈，而有的属于口唇。因为即使人里面最小的一部分也无不具有一个对应。<br />我经常蒙允许通过经历得知，那些处于对真理的情感之人属于广泛意义上所理解的这个区域。有一次，他们明显进入我的舌头，又有一次进入我的口唇；我被允许和他们说话。我还注意到，有的对应于舌头和口唇的更内在部分，而有的则对应于更外在部分。有些人只有对外层真理的情感，没有对内层真理的情感，因而只接受外层真理，不接受内层真理，尽管他们并不排斥后者。我在舌头的外层部分，而非内层部分感觉到这些人的活动。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE  CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN, HERE CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE THEREWITH OF THE TASTE AND THE TONGUE, AND ALSO OF THE FACE. The tongue affords entrance to the lungs, 
and also to the stomach, thus it represents as it were the court to spiritual and celestial things - to spiritual because it ministers to the lungs and thence to the speech, to celestial because it 
ministers to the stomach, which supplies food to the blood and heart. That the lungs correspond to spiritual, and the heart to celestial things, may be seen above (n. 3635, 3883-3896). Wherefore the 
tongue corresponds in general to the affection of truth, or to those in the Grand Man who are in the affection of truth, and afterwards in the affection of good from truth; and therefore they who love 
the Word of the Lord, and desire there from the knowledges of truth and of good, belong to this province; but with the difference that there are some who belong to the tongue itself, some to the larynx 
and the trachea, some to the throat, some to the gums, and some to the lips; for there does not exist even the least thing in man with which there is not correspondence. That they who are in the affection 
of truth belong to this province as understood in a wide sense, has often been granted me to experience, and this by manifest influx from them, now into the tongue, and now into the lips; and 
it has also been given me to converse with them, and to observe that there are some who correspond to the interiors of the tongue and of the lips, and others to the exteriors. The operation of those 
who receive with affection exterior truths only, and not interior, but without rejecting the latter, I felt not into the interiors of the tongue, but into the exteriors. </p>

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN - continued IN THIS SECTION THE CORRESPONDENCE OF TASTE AND OF THE TONGUE, AND ALSO OF THE FACE, WITH THAT GRAND MAN </p>
<p>The tongue provides an entrance leading into 
both the lungs and the stomach, and so represents a kind of forecourt leading to spiritual things and to celestial ones, to spiritual because it serves the lungs and thereby speech, to celestial because 
it serves the stomach which supplies nourishment to the blood and the heart. For the lungs correspond to spiritual realities, the heart to celestial ones, see <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>. All this being so, the 
tongue corresponds in general to the affection for truth, that is, to those in the Grand Man whose affection is for truth, and after that whose affection is for good which is a product of that truth. 
People therefore who love the Word of the Lord and wish to gain from it a knowledge of what is good and true belong to that province. Yet they differ from one another, in that some belong to the actual 
tongue, some to the larynx and trachea, some to the throat, some also to the gums, while others belong to the lips. For not even the smallest part of the human being fails to have a correspondence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
I have been allowed on many occasions to learn by experience that those governed by an affection for truth belong to that province understood in the broad sense. On one occasion they plainly 
entered my tongue, on another my lips; and I have been allowed to talk to them. I have also noticed that some correspond to the more internal parts of the tongue and lips, others to their more external 
parts. There are some who have an affection for and receive only exterior truths, not interior ones, though they do not reject them. The operation of these I have felt in the exterior but not the interior 
parts of my tongue. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia cum Maximo Homine, hic de Correspondentia Gustus et linguae, et quoque Faciei cum illo </p>
<p>Lingua introitum praebet ad pulmones, et quoque ad ventriculum, {1} ita repraesentat 
sicut atrium ad spiritualia et ad caelestia, ad spiritualia qui ministrat pulmonibus et inde loquelae, ad caelestia quia ministrat ventriculo qui alimenta praebet sanguini et cordi; quod 
pulmones correspondeant spiritualibus et cor caelestibus, videatur n. 3635, 3883-3896; </p>
<p>quapropter lingua in genere correspondet affectioni veri, seu illis in Maximo Homine qui in affectione veri sunt, 
et postmodum in affectione boni ex vero; qui itaque amant Verbum Domini, et inde desiderant cognitiones veri et boni, illi ac provinciam illam pertinent; sed cum differentia, quod sint qui ad ipsam 
linguam qui ad laryngem et tracheam, qui ad guttura, etiam qui ad gingivas, tum qui ad labra; nam ne quidem minimum apud hominem datur cum quo non es correspondentia.  [2] Quod illi qui in affectione 
veri sunt, ad provinciam illam in lato sensu intellectam pertineant, pluries datum est experiri, et hoc per manifestum influxum nunc in linguam et nunc in labra, cum quibus etiam loqui datum 
est; et observatum quod etiam quidam interioribus linguae e labrorum correspondeant, et quidam exterioribus; qui exteriora vera cum affectione solum recipiunt, non autem interiora, at {2} haec tamen 
non rejiciunt illorum operationem sensi non in linguae interiora sed in exteriora.      @1 i ac ministrat utrique$      @2 et$ </p>
