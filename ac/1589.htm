<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1589节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1589.</strong>“也像你到琐珥时的埃及地”表从对良善的情感所获得的知识。这从“埃及”和“琐珥”的含义清楚可知：前面（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>节）论述过埃及的含义，“埃及”的正面意义是指知识（<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；“琐珥”是指对良善的情感。琐珥是距离所多玛不远的一座城市，当天使将罗得从所多玛的大火中抢出来时，罗得也逃到这城（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.20.htm">19:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.30.htm">30</a>所描述的）。此外，其它地方也提到过琐珥（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.2.htm">14:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.8.htm">8</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申34.3.htm">34:3</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.5.htm">15:5</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.34.htm">48:34</a>），在所有这些地方，它都表示一种情感。它因表对良善的情感，故在反面意义上（既有正面意义又有反面意义是常见情形）也表对邪恶的情感。<br />外在人有三个组成部分：理性、知识和外在感觉。理性相对内在，知识相对外在，外在感觉则最为外在。内在人与外在人结合所凭借的，正是理性；理性的性质决定了该结合的性质。此处的外在感觉是指视觉和听觉。但是，理性本身并不存在，除非情感流入其中，将其激活，使之接受生命。由此可知，理性的性质取决于流入其中的情感的性质。若对良善的情感流入，它就会在理性中变成对真理的情感。若对邪恶的情感流入，情形则正好相反。由于知识依附于理性，并充当理性的工具，故可知，情感会流入知识，并重新组织它；因为外在人中唯有情感具有生命。其原因在于，对良善的情感从属天之物，即从属天之爱降下来，并将生命赋予它所流入的一切事物，甚至赋予对邪恶的情感，即恶欲。<br />实际上，来自主的爱之善不断经由内在人流入外在人。但人若由对邪恶的情感所支配，就会败坏这善，但带给它的生命却仍保留。这一点可通过对比光线落在物体上来理解。有些物体会以最美的方式接受光线，并将它们转换为最美的色彩，如钻石、红宝石、翡翠、蓝宝石，以及其它宝石。然而，有些物体却不以这种方式接受光线，反而将它们转换成最丑的色彩。同样的道理也可从不同人的不同秉性看出来。有些人从别人那里接受良善及其一切情感，有些人则将它们转变为邪恶。这表明，当理性“如同耶和华的园子”时，从对良善的情感所获得的知识，也就是“到琐珥时的埃及地”所表示的，是何性质。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1589.</strong> Like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar symbolizes facts acquired as a result of the desire for what is good, as the following symbolism indicates: Egypt (which is discussed in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164" target=_top>1164</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1165" target=_top>1165</a> and which is treated in a good sense in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1462" target=_top>1462</a>) symbolizes factual knowledge. And Zoar symbolizes the desire for what is good. The city of Zoar was not far from Sodom, and it was where Lot escaped to when angels rescued him from the conflagration of Sodom, as reported in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_genesis_19_20" target=_top>Genesis 19:20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_genesis_19_22" target=_top>22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_genesis_19_30" target=_top>30</a>. Zoar is also mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_2" target=_top>Genesis 14:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_8" target=_top>8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_34_3" target=_top>Deuteronomy 34:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_15_5" target=_top>Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_48_34" target=_top>Jeremiah 48:34</a>. Here too it symbolizes desires; and since it symbolizes the desire for what is good, in the opposite sense (which is the usual sense) it also symbolizes the desire for what is evil.<br />[2] Our outer self has three components: rationality, the facts we know, and our physical senses. Rationality lies within, knowledge is more superficial, and the physical senses form the surface. Rationality is what connects our inner and outer selves, and the nature of that connection depends on the nature of our rationality. (The physical senses here are sight and hearing.)<br />Our rational capacity, though, is worthless by itself, if our feelings or desires do not flow into it, activate it, and bring it to life. It follows, then, that the quality of our rational capacity mirrors the quality of our feelings. When a desire for goodness flows into our rational mind, it turns into a desire for truth there. The opposite happens when a desire for evil enters. And since the facts we know put themselves at the disposal of our rational mind and serve as tools for its use, it also follows that our feelings act on the facts we possess and arrange them in some kind of order.<br />Nothing in our outer self ever shows any life except emotion. Positive emotions come down from the heavenly plane, or in other words, from heavenly love, which bestows life on everything it touches. It even brings life to negative emotions, or corrupt desires.<br />[3] A loving goodness constantly flows in from the Lord, and it flows through the inner self into the outer. People under the sway of negative emotions or corrupt desires pervert that goodness, but the life that comes with it still remains.<br />To understand this, look at the way physical objects receive the sun's rays, by way of comparison. Some objects 钬?diamonds, rubies, hyacinths,{*1} sapphires, and other precious stones, for instance 钬?take the light very beautifully and turn it into gorgeous colors. Others do not but turn it into hideous colors instead. Another illustration is the very character of different people; some welcome the kindnesses of others with open arms, but some turn those kindnesses to evil.<br />All of this indicates what factual knowledge acquired as a result of the desire for goodness is 钬?this being what "the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar" symbolizes 钬?when the rational mind is like a garden of Jehovah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Ancient Greek and Latin literature speaks of a blue gemstone called "hyacinth" (hyacinthus in Latin; 峤懳何刮轿肝肯?[hu谩cinthos] in Greek) whose identity is no longer known. An example may be found in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_20" target=_top>Revelation 21:20</a>, where it is listed as the eleventh foundation stone of the New Jerusalem. A related name, "jacinth," is currently used of a gemstone that is orange in color. [LHC] </p>

Like the land of Egypt in coming to Zoar. That this signifies memory-knowledges from the affections of good, is evident from the signification of "Egypt" (see n. 1164, 1165; in a good sense, n. 1462) 
as being memory-knowledge; and from the signification of "Zoar," as being the affection of good. Zoar was a city not far from Sodom, whither also Lot fled when rescued by the angels from the burning 
of Sodom (described, Gen. 19:20, 22, 30). Zoar is also named in other places (Gen. 14:2, 8; Deut. 34:3; Isa. 15:5; Jer. 48:34), where also it signifies affection and as it signifies the affection of good, 
it also, in the opposite sense, as is common, signifies the affection of evil.  [2] There are three faculties which constitute the external man, namely, the rational, that of memory-knowledge, and 
the external sensuous. The rational is interior, the faculty of memory-knowledge is exterior, and this sensuous is outermost. It is the rational by means of which the internal man is conjoined with 
the external; and such as is the rational, such is the conjunction. The external sensuous, here, is the sight and the hearing. But in itself the rational is nothing, unless affection flows into it and 
makes it active, and causes it to live. It follows from this that the rational is such as is the affection. When the affection of good flows in, it becomes in the rational the affection of truth. The 
contrary is the case when the affection of evil flows in. As the faculty of memory-knowledge applies itself to the rational, and is an instrumentality for it, it follows that the affection inflows into 
this also, and disposes it; for nothing but affection ever lives in the external man. The reason of this is that the affection of good comes down from the celestial, that is, from celestial love, 
which vivifies everything into which it flows; it even vivifies the affections of evil, or cupidities.  [3] For the good of love from the Lord continually flows in through the internal man into the external; 
but the man who is in the affection of evil, or in cupidity, perverts the good; but still there remains life from it. This may be perceived by comparison with the objects which receive the rays 
of the sun. There are some that receive these rays most beautifully, and turn them into most beautiful colors, as do the diamond, the ruby, the jacinth, the sapphire, and other precious stones; but 
there are others which do not so receive them, but turn them into most disagreeable colors. The same may also be seen from the different genius of different men. There are those who receive goods from 
another with all affection; and there are those who turn them into evils. This shows what is that memory-knowledge from the affections of good that is signified by "the land of Egypt in coming to Zoar," 
when the rational is "like the garden of Jehovah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1589</b></p><p><b>1589.</b>
'Like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar' means facts acquired from affections for good. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'Egypt', dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, in a good sense in <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, as knowledge, 
and from the meaning of 'Zoar' as the affection for good. Zoar was a city not far from Sodom, to which also Lot fled when he was snatched by angels from the fire of Sodom, as described in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2019:20,%2022,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 19:20, 22, 30</a>. In addition to this, Zoar is referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2014:2,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 14:2, 8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2034:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 34:3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2015:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 15:5</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:34</a>, in all of which places also it means an affection. And since it means the affection for good, 
it also means in the contrary sense, as is usual, the affection for evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are three constituent parts of the external man - rational, factual, and external sensory. The rational part is 
more interior, the factual more exterior, and the external sensory the most external. The rational is the part by means of which the internal man is joined to the external, the character of the rational 
determining the character of this conjunction. The external sensory part consists in the present instance in sight and hearing. But in itself the rational has no existence if affection does not flow 
into it, making it active so as to receive life. Consequently the rational receives its character from that of the affection flowing into it. When the affection for good flows in, that affection for 
good becomes with the rational an affection for truth; and the contrary happens when the affection for evil flows in. Because the factual part attaches itself to the rational and serves as its agent 
it also follows that the affection flows into and reorganizes the factual part. For nothing has life in the external man apart from affection. The reason is that the affection for good comes down from 
the celestial, that is, from celestial love, which imparts life to everything into which it flows, even to affections for evil, that is, to evil desires. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Actually the good of love from the Lord 
flows in constantly, doing so through the internal man into the external. But anyone who is governed by an affection for evil, that is, by an evil desire, corrupts that good. Nevertheless the life brought 
to it remains. Such may be seen from a comparison with objects on which the sun's rays fall. There are some objects which accept them in a most beautiful way, converting them into the most beautiful 
colours, as a diamond, ruby, jacinth, sapphire, and other precious stones do Other objects however do not accept them in that manner but convert them into the ugliest colours. The same point may 
be shown from the very characters of people. There are some who accept the good actions of another with every display of affection, while others convert them into evil. From this it becomes clear what 
the knowledge acquired from affections for good is which is meant by 'the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar' when the rational is 'like the garden of Jehovah'. </p>

'Sicut terra Aegypti veniendo Zoar': quod significet scientifica ab affectionibus boni, constare potest a significatione 'Aegypti,' de qua n. 1164, 1165, in bono sensu, n. 1462, quod sit scientia, et 
a significatione 'Zoar' quod sit affectio boni; Zoar erat urbs non procul a Sodoma, quo etiam fugit Lot cum per angelos ereptus incendio Sodomae, de quo Gen. xix 20, 22, 30; et praeterea Zoar nominatur 
Gen. xiv 2, 8; Deut. xxxiv 3; Esai. xv 5; Jer. xlviii 34, ubi quoque significat affectionem; et quia affectionem boni, etiam in sensu opposito, quod commune, affectionem mali.  [2] Sunt tria quae 
externum hominem constituunt, nempe rationale, scientificum, et sensuale externum; rationale est interius, scientificum est exterius, sensuale hoc est extimum; rationale est per quod internus homo conjungitur 
externo; quale est rationale, talis est conjunctio; sensuale externum est hic visus et auditus; sed rationale in se nullum est nisi affectio influat in illud et faciat illud activum utque vivat; 
inde sequitur quod tale sit rationale qualis affectio; cum affectio boni influit, tunc fit affectio boni in rationali affectio veri; contrarium, cum affectio mali; quia scientificum se applicat rationali 
et est ejus instrumentale, sequitur etiam quod affectio influat in scientificum et disponat; nam nusquam aliquid vivit apud externum hominem quam affectio; causa est quia affectio boni descendit 
ex caelesti, hoc est, ab amore caelesti, qui vivificat omne in quod influit, immo etiam vivificat affectiones mali seu cupiditates; bonum enim amoris a Domino continue influit, et quidem per internum 
hominem in externum; sed homo qui in affectione mali seu cupiditate est, is pervertit bonum; sed usque manet inde vita; quod ut percipiatur, comparative videatur ex objectis quae recipiunt solis radios; 
quaedam sunt quae pulcherrime recipiant, et in pulcherrimos colores vertant, sicut adamas, rubinus, hyacinthus, sapphirus, et alii lapides pretiosi; at sunt quae non ita recipiunt, sed in turpissimos 
colores vertunt; constare quoque ab ipsis hominum geniis potest; sunt qui bona alius cum omni affectione recipiunt, et sunt qui vertunt in mala: inde constare potest quid sit scientia ab affectionibus 
boni quae significatur per 'terram Aegypti veniendo Zoar,' cum rationale est 'sicut Hortus Jehovae.' </p>
