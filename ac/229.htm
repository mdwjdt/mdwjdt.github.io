<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第229节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>229.</strong>创世记3:11-13 耶和华说，谁告诉你赤身露体呢？莫非你吃了我吩咐你不可吃的那树吗？那人说，你所赐给我与我同居的女人，她把那树给我，我就吃了。耶和华神对女人说，你作的是什么事呢？女人说，那蛇引诱我，我就吃了。<br />这些话的含义，从前面的解释已显而易见，就是说，人的理性任凭自己为自我所骗，因为他珍视自我，以致不信任何不能眼见手摸之物。不难看出，耶和华神不曾向蛇说话。事实上，这里并没有蛇，神也不曾向“蛇”所象征的感官说话。这里的意思是，他们发觉自己为感官所惑，但因我欲的驱使，他们愿意在信之前对自己所听闻的有关主和信的真理进行确认。</p>

And he said, "Who pointed out to you that you were naked? You ate from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat, didn't you?" And the human said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree and I ate." And Jehovah God said to the woman, "Why have you done this?" And the woman said, "The snake deceived me and I ate."<br />The symbolism in all of this is established by previous explanations [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_229/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_99" target=_top>99</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_229/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_128" target=_top>128-129</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_229/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196" target=_top>196</a>]: our rational capacity allows itself to be deceived by our sense of autonomy — which we love tenderly — or in other words, by self-love, so that we give no credit to anything we cannot see or feel.<br />Anyone can see that Jehovah God did not talk to a snake{*1} and that in fact there was no snake. Nor did he talk to the sensory part of the mind, symbolized by the snake. Rather, other things are involved. Specifically, people perceived that they had been deceived by their senses, and because they loved themselves, they were eager to know whether the things they heard about the Lord and about faith in him were true. Only then would they be willing to believe.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This is a reference to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_229/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_14" target=_top>Genesis 3:14</a>, in which God curses the snake.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 229</b></p><p><b>229.</b>
Verses 11-13. And He said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, 
she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And Jehovah God said unto the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. The signification of these words is evident 
from what has been explained before, namely, that the rational of man suffered itself to be deceived by its Own, because this was dear to him (that is, by the love of self), so that he believed 
nothing but what he could see and feel. Everyone can see that Jehovah God did not speak to a serpent, and indeed that there was no serpent, neither did He address the sensuous part that is signified 
by the "serpent;" but that these words involve a different meaning, namely, that they perceived themselves to be deluded by the senses, and yet, in consequence of self-love, were desirous of ascertaining 
the truth of what they had heard concerning the Lord, and concerning faith in Him, before they believed it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 229</b></p><p><b>229.</b>
Verses 11-13 And He said, Who pointed out to you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree concerning which I commanded you that you should not eat from it? And the man said, The woman whom You 
gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat. And Jehovah God said to the woman, Why have you done this? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.  </p>
<p>The meaning of these 
verses is clear from explanations given already, namely that man's rational allowed itself to be so deceived by the cherished proprium, that is, by self-love, that he believed nothing unless he could 
see and touch it. Anyone may recognize that Jehovah God did not speak to a serpent, and indeed that there was no serpent, nor even that He spoke to the sensory part of man, which is meant by the serpent. 
Anyone may recognize that these statements embody something different, namely that men perceived that they were deceived by their physical senses, but because they loved themselves they first 
desired to know whether what they had heard about the Lord and about faith in Him was true before they were ready to believe it.  </p>

</p><b>229.</b>
Vers 11-13. Et dixit, Quis indicavit tibi, quod nudus tu? annon de arbore, de qua praecepi tibi ut non edas de ea, edisti? Et dixit homo, Mulier, quam dedisti mecum, ea dedit mihi de arbore, et comedi. 
Et dixit Jehovah Deus mulieri, Quare hoc fecisti? Et dixit mulier, Serpens decepit me, et edi.  Quid haec significant, ex prius explicatis constat; nempe quod rationale hominis se passum sit decepi 
a proprio quod ei carum, seu ab amore sui, ut nihil crederet nisi videret et sentiret. Quisque videre potest quod Jehovah Deus non allocutus sit serpentem, et quod serpens non fuerit, nec quod allocutus 
sensuale, quod per serpentem significatur, sed quod alia involvant; nempe quod perceperint se deceptos esse per sensus, et quia se amaverunt, quod cupiverint cognoscere num verum esset quod audiverunt 
de Domino et de fide in Ipsum, et sic primum credere voluerint.
