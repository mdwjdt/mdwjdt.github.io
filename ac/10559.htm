<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10559节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10559</strong>.“摩西对耶和华说”表对神性，因而教会本身不与他们同住的恼怒。这从“说”的含义清楚可知。“说”在此是指恼怒，因为“说”包括接下来的事，这些事就是他实际所说的；接下来的事是表达了一种恼怒，因为神性不愿与他们同住。既然如此，那么教会就不会与他们同住，从而无法使他们比地面上的所有人都更显赫，这从接下来的16节经文明显看出来。摩西对耶和华所说的这些话之所以表达了由此而来的恼怒，是因为摩西在此代表以色列民族的首领（参看<a href="10556.htm">10556</a>节）；因此，他代表自己和这个民族说话，因为他说“我和百姓”（33:16）。由于他现在作为首领而代表这个民族，“摩西对耶和华说”表示恼怒，因为凡具有像这个民族那样的性质之人，若不能实现自己的愿望，都会恼怒神。<br />凡兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物的人都是这样行的，因为如果他们敬畏神，敬拜神，似乎也爱祂，那也是为他们自己，而非神自己的缘故。他们唯一的愿望就是超越他人的显赫和超越他人的财富。促使他们敬拜敬畏神，敬拜神，似乎也爱祂的，就是这种燃烧的愿望。但是，他们若得不到他们想要的东西，就会抛弃神。这个民族就具有这种秉性，这一事实从圣言的历史很明显地看出来。雅各所说的话就具有这种含义：<br />雅各立下一个誓言，说，神若与我同在，在我所行的路上保佑我，又给我食物吃、衣服穿。使我平平安安地回到我父亲的家，耶和华必作我的神。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.20.htm">28:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这些话的意思是，他若得到这些东西，就会承认耶和华为他的神；若得不到，就不会承认祂。这个民族作为他的后代，也具有这种思想。这解释了为何这个民族频频抛弃祂，敬拜别神，直到最后他们由于这个原因而被逐出迦南地，先是以色列民族被逐出，然后是犹太民族。<br />显然，上面提到的这种恼怒的原因是，如果耶和华不与他们同去，他们就不会比全世界所有人都要显赫。这种恼怒的另外一个原因是，教会本身不会存在于他们当中，这一点从以下事实可推知：被耶和华领进迦南地表示成为一个教会。原因在于，自上古时代起，教会就一直在迦南地，并且圣言无法在其它任何地方写成，因而只能在占据这个地方的民族当中写成；圣言所在之地就是教会所在之地。圣言无法在其它任何地方写成，是因为整个迦南地及其周围的所有地方，如大山、山谷、河流、森林等等，都成为属天和属灵事物的代表；圣言的字义，无论圣言的历史部分中的，还是先知书部分中的，都必须由这类代表事物构成。之所以必须如此，是因为属天和属灵的圣言内层必须终止于这类事物，可以说停靠于其上，如同房屋立于其地基之上。因为就其字义，也就是圣言的最末和最低层而言，圣言若不停靠于这些事物之上，就会像没有地基的房屋。事实的确如此，这一点从圣言明显看出来，因为圣言如此频繁地提到迦南地的各个地方，这些地方都成为代表，表示天堂和教会的事物。<br />这一切解释了为何被领进迦南地表示教会的建立，为何摩西的恼怒与这件事有关，尽管他没有想到这一点。自上古时代起，教会就存在于迦南地，因此迦南地的所有地方都成为代表（参看<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>，<a href="8317.htm">8317</a>，<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>，<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节）；由于同样的原因，在圣言中，“迦南地”表示教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10559</b></p><p><b>10559.</b>
And Moses said unto Jehovah. That this signifies indignation that the Divine was not with them, thus not the church itself, is evident from the signification of "saying," as here being indignation, for 
"saying" involves the things which follow, because these are what he said, and the things which follow are things of indignation on this account, that the Divine would not be with them, thus that the 
church would not be with them, whereby they might be rendered pre-eminent to all that were upon the face of the earth, as is plain from verse sixteen which follows. The reason why the words of Moses 
to Jehovah were words of indignation on that account, was that Moses here bears relation to the head of the Israelitish nation (see above, n. 10556); wherefore he speaks for himself and for that nation, 
for he says, "I and the people" (verse 16). And because he here bears relation to that nation as its head, therefore by "Moses said unto Jehovah" is signified indignation; for a man who is such as 
was that nation, is indignant against God if he does not obtain his desires. [2] This is done by all those who are in external things without what is internal, for if they reverence and adore God, 
and as it were love Him, it is not for His own sake, but for the sake of themselves, because they desire nothing else than eminence above others and wealth beyond others, this being the fire which excites 
their reverence and adoration, and as it were their love. But if they do not obtain what they desire, they forsake God. That that nation was of such a character is very evident from the historicals 
of the Word. The like is signified by the words of Jacob: </p>
<p>     Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way wherein I walk, and will give me bread to eat, and a 
garment to put on, and I return in peace to my father's house, then Jehovah shall be to me for God (Gen. 28:20, 21). These words mean that if he should receive these things, he would acknowledge Jehovah 
for his God; but if he should not receive them, he would not acknowledge Him. Such also was the nation descended from him. From this it is that that nation so often fell away, and worshiped other 
gods, until at last they were for this reason cast out from the land of Canaan, first the Israelitish nation, and afterward the Jewish. It is evident that the cause of the indignation above spoken of 
was that if Jehovah did not go with them they would not become preeminent to all in the whole world.  [3] That it was also a cause of indignation that the church itself was not with them, follows from 
the fact that to be brought by Jehovah into the land of Canaan denotes to become the church. The reason of this is that the church had been in the land of Canaan from the most ancient times, and that 
the Word could not have been written elsewhere, thus except with the nation which possessed that land; and where the Word is, there is the church. That the Word could not have been written anywhere 
else was because all the places that were in the whole of that land, and that were round about it, such as the mountains, the valleys, the rivers, the forests, and all the rest, had become representative 
of celestial and spiritual things; and it was necessary that the sense of the letter of the Word, in both the historical and the prophetical parts, should consist of such things, because the interior 
things of the Word, which are celestial and spiritual, must close in such things, and as it were stand on them like a house upon its foundation; for unless the Word in respect to the sense of the 
letter, which is its ultimate, stood upon such things, it would be like a house without a foundation. That this is so is evident from the Word, in that mention is so often made of the places of that land, 
all of which, having become representative, signify the things of heaven and of the church. [4] From this it is that to be brought into the land of Canaan signifies the setting up of the church, 
and that the indignation of Moses involves this also, although he did not think of it. (That the church was in the land of Canaan from the most ancient times, and that consequently all the places therein 
became representative, see n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6306, 6516, 8317, 9320, 9325; and that from this "the land of Canaan" in the Word signifies the church, see the places cited in n. 9325.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10559</b></p><p><b>10559.</b>
'And Moses said to Jehovah' means annoyance that the Divine, and so the Church itself, does not reside with them. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' here as annoyance, for it includes what comes 
after it, this being what he actually said; and what comes after it is an expression of annoyance because the Divine was not willing to reside with them. That being so, the Church would not reside 
with them to make them more distinguished than all who are on the face of the earth, as is evident from verse 16 below. The reason why Moses' words to Jehovah were an expression of annoyance because 
of this was that Moses now represents the head of the Israelite nation, see above in <a href="10556.htm">10556</a>; therefore he speaks on behalf of himself and of that nation, for in verse 16 he says 'I and the people'. And 
since he now represents that nation as its head, the words 'Moses said to Jehovah' mean annoyance, for anyone who is by nature like that nation is annoyed with God if he does not attain his desires. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is how all whose interest lies in external things devoid of what is internal behave; for if they revere and worship God, and seem to love Him, they do so not for His sake but their own. Their 
only desire is for pre-eminence over others and greater wealth than others. This burning desire is what moves them to revere, worship, and seemingly love Him. But if they do not obtain the things 
they desire they forsake God. The fact that that nation was like this is plainly evident from the historical narratives in the Word. The following words spoken by Jacob have a similar meaning,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob 
made a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and guard me on this road on which I am walking, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, and I come back in peace to my father's house, then 
Jehovah will be my God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:20,21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:20,21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The import of these words is that if he received those things he would acknowledge Jehovah as his God, but if he did not receive them he would not do so. Of 
such a mind also was the nation descended from him. This explains why that nation forsook Him so many times and worshipped other gods, till at length they were for that reason expelled from the land 
of Canaan, first the Israelite nation and afterwards the Jewish.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is evident that the cause of the annoyance referred to above lay in the fact that they would not become more distinguished than 
all throughout the whole world if Jehovah did not go with them. Another cause of that annoyance was that the Church itself would not exist among them, which follows from this, that being led by Jehovah 
into the land of Canaan means being made a Church. The reasons for this are that the Church had existed in the land of Canaan since most ancient times, and that the Word could not have been written 
anywhere else than in that land, thus among the nation that possessed it, and the place where the Word exists is where the Church exists. The Word could not have been written anywhere else than there 
because all the places throughout the whole of that land, and those around it - the mountains, valleys, rivers, forests, and everything else - had become representative of celestial and spiritual 
realities, and the literal sense of the Word in both the historical sections and the prophetical parts must of necessity consist of such representative things. It must do so because the interiors of the 
Word, which are celestial and spiritual, terminate in such things and so to speak rest on them like a house on its foundations. For unless the Word as to its literal sense, which is the last and lowest 
level of it, rested on those things it would be like a house without foundations. The truth of this is evident from the Word, in that references are made so many times to places in that land, all 
of which, having become representative, are signs for the realities of heaven and the Church. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 All this explains why being led into the land of Canaan means the establishment of the Church and why 
Moses' annoyance has to do with the same thing, though nothing of that was in his mind.  </p>
<p>The Church had existed in the land of Canaan since most ancient times, and for this reason all the places there 
became representative, see <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>, <a href="8317.htm">8317</a>, <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>, <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>.

`Et dixit Moscheh ad Jehovam':  quod significet indignationem quod non Divinum, ita quod non ipsa Ecclesia apud illos, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod hic sit indignatio, nam dicere involvit 
sequentia, haec enim sunt quae dixit, et sequentia sunt indignationis {1}propter id, quod non Divinum vellet apud eos esse, ita quod non apud illos Ecclesia, per quod praestantiores redderentur omnibus 
{2}qui super faciebus terrae, ut patet a vers.  (t)16 seq.; quod verba Moschis ad Jehovam essent indignationis propterea, erat quia Moscheh hic {3}refert caput gentis Israeliticae, videatur supra n. 
(x)10556, quapropter pro se, et pro illa gente loquitur, nam dicit `ego et populus,' vers. 16; et quia illam gentem ut caput hic refert, ideo per `dixit Moscheh ad Jehovam' significatur indignatio; 
homo enim qui talis est qualis (t)illa gens, indignatur contra Deum si non potitur cupitis; [2] hoc faciunt omnes qui in externis sunt absque interno, illi enim si venerantur et adorant Deum et quasi 
amant, non est propter Ipsum sed propter se, nam non volunt aliud quam eminentiam super alios et opulentiam prae aliis; hic ignis est qui eorum venerationem et adorationem et quasi amorem excitat; at 
si non obtinent quae cupiunt, relinquunt Deum; quod gens illa talis fuerit, patet manifeste ab historicis Verbi; simile significatur per haec verba Jacobi, 	Vovit Jacob votum, dicendo, Si fuerit Deus 
cum me, et custodiverit me in via hac quam ego ambulans, et dederit mihi panem ad edendum, et vestem ad induendum, et rediero in pace ad domum patris mei, et erit Jehovah mihi in Deum, Gen. xxviii 20, 
21; </p>
<p>quae involvunt, quod si illa {4}acceperit, agnosceret Jehovam pro suo Deo, at si non {5}acceperit, non agnosceret; talis etiam fuit gens quae ab Ipso; inde est quod gens illa toties desciverit, 
et coluerit alios deos, usque ut tandem propterea {6}ejiceretur e terra Canaane, primum gens Israelitica et postea Judaica.  Quod causa indignationis, de qua supra, fuerit, quod non praestantiores fierent 
omnibus in universo terrarum (x)orbe {7}si non Jehovah iret cum illis, patet; [3] quod etiam indignationis causa fuerit quod non ipsa Ecclesia esset apud illos, sequitur ex eo quod a Jehovah introduci 
in terram Canaanem sit fieri Ecclesia; causa quod ita sit, est quia Ecclesia in terra Canaane fuerat ab antiquissimis temporibus, et {8}quia non alibi potuerat conscribi Verbum quam ibi, ita apud 
gentem quae possideret illam terram, et ubi Verbum ibi Ecclesia; quod non alibi conscribi posset Verbum quam ibi, erat quia omnia loca quae in universa illa terra, et quae circum illam, sicut montes, 
{9}valles, (t)fluvii, silvae, et reliqua, repraesentativa caelestium et spiritualium facta (x)fuerunt, et Verbi sensus litterae tam in historicis quam in propheticis, ex talibus necessario erit; quoniam 
interiora Verbi, quae sunt caelestia et spiritualia, desinent in talia, et quasi insistent eis {10}sicut domus super suo fundamento, {11}nam nisi (x)Verbum quoad sensum litterae, qui est ultimum 
ejus, insisteret talibus, foret id sicut domus absque fundamento; quod ita sit, {12}patet ex Verbo, quod toties ibi memorentur loca illius terrae, quae omnia, quia repraesentativa facta, significant 
res caeli et Ecclesiae; inde {13}est quod introduci in terram Canaanem significet instaurationem Ecclesiae, et quod indignatio Moschis etiam illud involvat tametsi id {14}non cogitavit.  Quod in terra 
Canaane Ecclesia fuerit ab antiquissimis temporibus, et quod inde omnia loca ibi repraesentativa facta sint, videatur n. (x)3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, (x) 6306, 6516, 8317, 9320, 9325, et quod
