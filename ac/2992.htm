<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2992节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2992.</strong>我从大量经历得知，在尘世及其三个王国中，若非代表灵界的某种事物，也就是说，若非在灵界拥有它所对应的某种事物，即使最小的事物也不存在。此外，以下许多其它经历也向我清楚表明了这一点：有好几次，当我谈论人体器官，从头到胸，甚至到腹来追踪它们之间的联系时，我上面的天使便通过这些器官所对应的属灵之物引导我的思维，并且精准无误。他们根本不去想我正在思考的人体器官，只思想这些器官所对应的属灵之物。这就是天使的聪明，他们通过属灵之物了解人体的每一个部位，甚至最隐秘的事，就是世人决无法知道的那类事。事实上，他们完全知晓整个宇宙中的每一个事物，毫无差错。这是因为起因和起因的初始就存在于这些属灵之物中。</p>

It has been given me to know from much experience that in the natural world and its three kingdoms there is nothing whatever that does not represent something in the spiritual world, or that has not 
something there to which it corresponds. Besides many other experiences, this was made evident also from the following. On several occasions when I was speaking of the viscera of the body, and was tracing 
their connection from those which are of the head to those which are of the chest, and so on to those which are of the abdomen, the angels that were above me led my thoughts through the spiritual 
things to which those viscera correspond, and this so that there was not the least error. They thought not at all of the viscera of the body of which I was thinking, but only of the spiritual things 
to which these correspond. Such is the intelligence of angels that from spiritual things they know all things in the body in general and particular, even the most secret things, such as can never come 
to man's knowledge; nay, they know everything there is in the universal world, without a mistake; and this because from spiritual things are the causes, and the beginnings of causes. </p>

From much experience I have been given to know that in the natural world, and in its three kingdoms, not even the smallest thing exists which does not represent something in the spiritual world, that 
is, which does not have in that world something to which it corresponds. Among many other experiences the following has made this clear to me: Several times when I have been talking about the organs 
of the body and have been tracing the connection of them from the things of the head to those of the chest, and even to those of the abdomen, the angels above me have on those occasions led my thoughts 
through the spiritual things to which these parts of the body corresponded, doing so indeed in such a way that nothing was inexact. They did not think at all about the organs of the body as I was doing, 
only of the spiritual things to which those organs corresponded. The angels' intelligence is such that from spiritual things they know every single part of the body, even the most secret, which cannot 
possibly come to be known by man. Indeed they have a faultless knowledge of every single thing in the entire universe, and this they have because causes, and the first beginnings of causes, exist 
among those spiritual things. </p>

</p><b>2992.</b>
Ex multa experientia mihi scire datum est quod in mundo naturali, inque tribus ejus regnis, ne hilum sit quod non repraesentet aliquid in mundo spirituali, seu quod non ibi habeat aliquid cui correspondeat; 
praeter plures experientias id quoque constare {1}potuit ab hac: aliquoties cum in loquela essem de visceribus corporis, et sequerer nexum illorum ab illis quae sunt capitis, ad illa quae sunt 
thoracis, usque ad illa quae sunt abdominis, quod tunc angeli qui supra me erant, duxerint cogitationes meas per spiritualia quibus illa correspondebant, et quidem ita ut nihil aberraret; illi ne hilum 
cogitabant de visceribus corporis de quibus ego, sed solum de spiritualibus quibus correspondebant.  Talis est intelligentia angelica ut ex spiritualibus sciant omnia et singula quae in corpore, etiam 
arcanissima, quae nusquam ad cognitionem hominis pervenire possunt, immo omnia et singula quae in universo mundo, absque fallacia, et hoc quia inde causae, et causarum principia. @1 potest$  </p>
