<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1712.</strong>“他和他的奴仆趁夜分队，攻击他们”表示表面的良善与真理所在的幽暗。这从“夜”的含义清楚可知，“夜”是指幽暗的状态。当人不知道良善与真理是表面的还是纯正的时，这种情形就被称为幽暗状态。人若局限于表面的良善与真理，就会以为这些是纯正的良善与真理。正是存在于表面的良善与真理中的邪恶与虚假制造了幽暗，并使它们看似纯正。无知之人除了知道他们所行之善、所思之真是他们自己的外，还能知道什么？这同样适用于那些将他们所做的善行归给自己，并将功德置于其中之人。殊不知，在这种情况下，这些行为并非良善，只是看似良善。他们置于其中的自我和自我功德就是造成昏昧和黑暗的邪恶和虚假。其它很多例子也是如此。<br />隐藏在它们里面的恶与假的种类和数量在肉身生活期间不象在来世看得那么清楚。在来世，它们完全就象在大白天一样呈于眼见。不过，若人出于未经确认的无知行事，情况就不同了。因为这种情况下，那些恶与假很容易被驱散。不过，若人确信这样的观点，即他们凭自己的力量行善、抗恶，因此他们配得救赎，那么，这样的观点仍会粘附，并使善成为恶，使真成为假。然而，按照秩序，人应貌似自主行善，因而不应停手并持有“既然无法凭自己行善事，那我只好等待直接流注”的想法，从而停留在消极状态，因为这也违反秩序。人必须貌似自主行善，然而，当反思自己所行或曾行过的善事时，必须思考、承认并相信：做这善事的，是与他同在的主。<br />他若因上面提及的想法而放弃努力，就不是主能进入其中运作的对象了。主无法流入凡丧失可被注入力量的一切事物之人里面。他就象是若不给他启示，就不愿学习任何东西的人；或若不将话语放到他嘴里，就不愿教导任何事的人；或若不象一个没有意愿的人那样被指引，就不愿尝试任何事的人。不过，若真这样做，他会因如同一个无生命之物而愈加愤慨。然而，事实上，主在人里面所激活之物正是那看似来自他自己之物。人靠自己无法存活，这是一个永恒的真理。然而，若不看似靠自己存活，他根本无法存活。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1712.</strong> He divided [his forces] against [the enemy] by night means the shadow that the apparent goodness and truth were in, which can be seen from the symbolism of night as shadowy conditions.<br />Conditions are said to be shadowy when we do not know whether a thing appears to be good and true or actually is good and true. Everyone who experiences apparent goodness and truth considers it genuinely good and true. The evil and falsity that lurk in apparent goodness and truth are what cast a shadow over it and make it appear real.<br />People who do not know any better cannot help seeing the good they do as their own and the truth they think as their own. The same applies to those who take credit for the good they do and feel that it makes them deserving. All the while they are unaware that the good is not good, even though it seems so, and that the sense of pride and personal merit they place in their deeds is an evil and a lie, which darkens and clouds their sight. The same applies in many other situations as well.<br />[2] The type and amount of evil and falsity that lies hidden within can never be seen as clearly during physical life as in the next life. There it stands out just as plain to see as in broad daylight.<br />The situation is different, though, if we commit the error out of an ignorance that has not yet hardened. In that case, the evils and falsities are easily shaken off. But if we reinforce the belief that we can do good and resist evil under our own power, and that we earn salvation by doing so, this attitude clings. It turns good into evil and truth into falsity.<br />Still, the proper method is for us to do good as if on our own. We should not throw up our hands thinking, "If I can't do any good on my own, I ought to wait for direct inspiration; till then I should lie passive."{*1} This too is wrong. Instead we should do good as if we were doing it on our own, but when we reflect on the good we are doing (or have done), we ought to think, acknowledge, and believe that the Lord working in us is actually doing the good.<br />[3] If we abandon all effort because of the kind of thinking mentioned, the Lord cannot work in us. He cannot act on those who rid themselves of every capacity for receiving the power to do good. It is like saying that you refuse to learn anything unless it comes to you as revelation. Or like saying that you refuse to teach anything unless the words are planted in your mouth. Or like refusing to try anything unless you can be propelled like an automaton. If this did happen, you would be still more resentful for feeling like an inanimate object. The reality is that what the Lord animates in us is that which seems to be ours. For instance, it is an eternal truth that life is not ours; but if it did not seem to be, we would have no life at all.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This passage could be aimed at spiritual sloth in general or at advocates of Quietism in particular. Quietism was a seventeenth-century movement, active particularly in the Catholic Church and condemned by it, that held that the supreme achievement of human life was complete submission to divine providence and a withdrawal from distracting religious activities such as overt prayer, with the aim of achieving a constant state of awareness of God. See The New Catholic Encyclopedia 2003, under "quietism." [RS] </p>

He divided himself against them by night. That this signifies the shade in which the apparent goods and truths were, is evident from the signification of "night," as being a state of shade. There is 
said to be a state of shade when it is not known whether the good and truth are apparent or are genuine. When anyone is in apparent good and truth, he supposes them to be genuine good and truth; the evil 
and falsity that are in apparent good and truth are what cause the shade, and make them appear genuine. They who are in ignorance can know no otherwise than that the good which they do is their own, 
and that the truth which they think is their own, and it is the same with those who attribute to themselves the goods they do, and place merit in them, not knowing that in this case they are not good, 
although they appear so; and that the Own and self-merit which they place in them are the evils and falsities which obscure and darken. So in many other cases.  [2] The kind and the measure of the 
evil and falsity which lie concealed in them, cannot possibly be so well seen in the life of the body as in the other life, where they are presented to view as in clear light. But the case is different 
if this is done from ignorance that is not confirmed, for in this case those evils and falsities are easily dispersed. But if men confirm themselves in the belief that they can do good and resist 
evil by their own powers, and that they thus merit salvation, in this case this idea remains attached, and causes the good to be evil, and the truth to be falsity. But still it is according to order for 
a man to do good as of himself; and therefore he ought not to slacken his hand, with the thought, "If I can do nothing of good from myself, I ought to wait for immediate influx," and thus remain in 
a passive state, for this would be contrary to order; but he must do good as of himself; yet, when he reflects upon the good which he does or has done, let him think, acknowledge, and believe that the 
Lord has done the work in him.  [3] If he slackens his effort, thinking as has been said, he is then not a subject into which the Lord can operate. The Lord cannot flow into anyone who deprives himself 
of everything into which power can be infused. It is as if one were not willing to learn anything without a revelation to himself; or as if one would teach nothing unless the words were put into 
him; or as if one would attempt nothing unless he were put into action as one without will. But if these things were done, he would be still more indignant at being like an inanimate thing; when yet that 
which is animated by the Lord in a man is that which appears as if it were from himself. It is thus an eternal truth that a man does not live from himself, but that if he did not appear to live from 
himself he could not live at all. </p>

That 'he divided himself against them by night' means the shade which the apparent goods and truths were in is clear from the meaning of 'night' as a state of shade. It is called a state of shade when 
a person does not know whether good and truth are apparent or genuine. While a person is limited to apparent good and truth he imagines that these are genuine good and truth. It is the evil and falsity 
present in apparent good and truth that produce the shade and cause them to be seen as genuine. What else can people who are in ignorance know than that the good they do is their own, and that the 
truth they think is their own? The same applies to people who ascribe the good deeds they do to themselves and place merit in them, unaware of the fact that in this case those deeds are not good though 
they appear to be so, and that the proprium and the self-merit they place in them are evils and falsities that cause obscurity and darkness. And the same applies in many other instances. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What 
evil and falsity are like, and how much evil and falsity lie concealed in such deeds, cannot possibly be seen so clearly in the life of the body as in the next life, where these are presented to view 
altogether as in broad daylight. But it is different if a person acts out of ignorance that has not been confirmed, for in that case those evils and falsities are easily dispersed. But if people confirm 
themselves in the notion that they are able to do good and to withstand evil by their own powers, and that thus they merit salvation, such a notion remains attached, and causes the good to be evil, 
and the truth to be falsity. Yet for all this, order requires that a person should do good as though from himself, and ought not therefore to stay his hand and think to himself, 'If I am unable to 
do anything good at all from myself I must wait for immediate influx' and so remain inactive. This is also contrary to order. Man ought to do good as though from himself; but when he stops to reflect 
on the good he is doing or has done, let him think, acknowledge, and believe that the Lord present with him has accomplished it. </p>

 If by thinking as described he gives up acting as of himself he 
is not a subject into whom the Lord can operate. The Lord cannot flow into anyone who deprives himself of everything into which power has to be introduced. He is like someone who is not willing to learn 
anything except through a revelation made to him; or like someone who is not willing to teach anything unless the words are put into his mouth; or like someone who is unwilling to attempt anything 
unless he is directed as one without a will. But if this were done he would be more indignant still at being like an inanimate object. In fact however that which is animated by the Lord in a person is 
the very thing which makes it seem as though it were from himself. That man does not live from himself is an eternal truth; yet if he did not appear to do so he could not possibly live at all. </p>

</p><b>1712.</b>
'Distribuit se super eos noctu': quod significet umbram in qua fuerunt bona et vera apparentia, constat a significatione 'noctis' quod sit status umbrae: status umbrae dicitur cum ignoratur num sit 
bonum et verum apparens vel bonum et verum genuinum; quisque dum in bono et vero apparente est, putat esse bonum et verum genuinum; est illud malum et falsum quod est in bono et vero apparent quod inumbrat, 
et facit ut appareat genuinum; qui in ignorantia sunt non aliter scire possunt quam quod bonum quod faciunt sit illorum et verum quod cogitant sit illorum; similiter qui sibi tribuunt bona quae 
faciunt, et in illis ponunt meritum, nescientes tunc quod non bona sint tametsi ita apparent, et quod proprium et meritum sui quod ponunt in illis, sint mala et falsa quae obscurant et obtenebrant; ita 
in multis aliis;  [2] quale malum et falsum, et quantum mali et falsi in illis reconditum latet, nusquam ita videri potest in vita corporis sicut in altera vita; tunc prorsus sicut in clara luce sistuntur 
videnda; sed aliter est si hoc fit ex ignorantia non confirmata, tunc mala illa et falsa facile discutiuntur; at si se confirmant in eo quod propriis viribus possint facere bonum et resistere 
malo, et quod mereantur sic salutem tunc manet hoc adjunctum et facit ut bonum sit malum, et verum sit falsum; sed usque talis est ordo ut homo tanquam ex se bonum faciat, et ideo non remittere debeat 
manum, cogitando, Si nihil boni a me facere possum, quod exspectare debeam immediatum influxum, et sic in statu passivo manere, hoc quoque contra ordinem est; sed facere oportet bonum tanquam ex se, 
at cum reflectit super bonum quod facit vel fecerat, tunc cogitet, agnoscat et credat quod Dominus apud se hoc operatus est; [3] si se remittit ita cogitando, ut dictum, tunc non est subjectum in quod 
Dominus operari potest; non potest influere in aliquem qui se deprivat omni tali in quod vires infundendae sunt est sicut quis nihil discere vellet nisi ei revelatio; aut sicut quis nihil docere, nisi 
voces ei inderentur; aut sicut quis nihil conari, nisi ageretur sicut absque voluntate; quod si fieret, indignaretur adhuc plus quod sicut inanimatum quid esset, cum tamen quod a Domino animatur apud 
hominem, est id quod apparet tanquam foret ab illo: sicut quod homo non vivit a se, quod est veritas aeterna; nisi appareret sicut viveret ex se, nusquam vivere posset. </p>
