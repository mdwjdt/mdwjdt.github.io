<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8431.</strong>“耶和华晚上必给你们肉吃”表在一个状态结束时良善就会通过快乐变成他们自己的。这从“晚上”和“肉”的含义清楚可知：“晚上”是指一个状态的结束（参看<a href="8426.htm">8426</a>节）；“肉”是指活过来的自我，或一个人从主那里所拥有的一个天堂自我，因而是指爱之良善（<a href="148.htm">148</a>，<a href="149.htm">149</a>，<a href="780.htm">780</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="8409.htm">8409</a>开头节），但在此是指信之良善，因为它是一只叫“鹌鹑”的飞鸟的肉。因为“飞鸟”表示属灵之物或属信之物；因此，它的“肉”表示信之良善，在此表示属世人的良善，也就是快乐。要知道，“吗哪”表示内在人或属灵人的良善，而“鹌鹑”表示外在人或属世人的良善，也就是所谓的快乐。它们就具有这些含义，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：吗哪是在早晨赐下的，而鹌鹑是在晚上赐下的；早晨赐下的东西表示属灵良善，晚上赐下的东西表示属世良善或快乐。因为在来世，早晨的状态出现在属灵良善或内在人的良善处在清晰之中，而属世良善或外在人的良善处在模糊之中的时候；但晚上的状态出现在属世良善或外在人的良善处在清晰之中，而属灵良善或内在人的良善处在模糊之中的时候。这些状态也以这种方式交替变化，好叫此人能得以完善，尤其叫良善可以变成此人自己的；在晚上的状态下，这一点通过快乐实现。</p>

In that Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat. That this signifies that in the end of the state good will be appropriated by means of delight, is evident from the signification of "evening," 
as being the end of a state (see above, n. 8426); and from the signification of "flesh," as being one's own made alive, or one's heavenly own which a man has from the Lord, thus the good of love 
(n. 148, 149, 780, 3813, 7850, 8409); but here the good of faith, because it was the flesh of a bird or flying thing called "quail." For by a flying thing is signified what is spiritual, or what is of 
faith; consequently by its "flesh" is signified good of that quality, here the good of the natural man, or delight. Be it known that by "the manna" is signified the good of the internal or spiritual 
man, but by "the quail" the good of the external or natural man, which is called delight; and that such is their signification is evident from the fact that the manna was given in the morning time, but 
the quail in the evening time; and by that which is given in the morning time is signified spiritual good, and by that which is given in the evening time is signified natural good or delight. For in 
the other life the state of morning is when spiritual good, or the good of the internal man, is in clearness; and natural good, or the good of the external man, is in obscurity: but the state of evening 
is when natural good, or the good of the external man, is in clearness and spiritual good, or the good of the internal man, is in obscurity. These alternations thus succeed each other also to the 
intent that the man may be perfected, especially that good may be appropriated to him, which in the state of evening is effected by means of delight. </p>

Jehovah is giving you flesh to eat in the evening means that at the end of a state good will become their own through delight. This is clear from the meaning of 'the evening' as the end of a state, dealt 
with above in <a href="8426.htm">8426</a>; and from the meaning of 'flesh' as a proprium made alive, or a heavenly proprium which a person possesses from the Lord, thus the good of love, dealt with in <a href="148.htm">148</a>, <a href="149.htm">149</a>, <a href="780.htm">780</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="8409.htm">8409</a> (beginning), though here the good of faith is meant since it was the flesh of a bird that flies, called 'selav'. For 'a bird that flies' means that which is spiritual or belongs to faith, 
so that 'its flesh' means the good of faith, at this point the natural man's good, which is delight. It should be recognized that 'manna' means the internal or spiritual man's good, while 'selav' means 
the external or natural man's good, which is called delight. That they have these meanings is made clear by the fact that the manna was given in the morning but the selav in the evening; and what 
was given in the morning means spiritual good, and what was given in the evening means natural good, or delight. For a morning state in the next life occurs when spiritual good, the internal man's good, 
is in evidence and natural or the external man's good is obscured, and an evening state occurs when natural good, the external man's good, is in evidence and spiritual or the internal man's good is 
obscured. These states also alternate with each other in this way, to the end that a person may be made more perfect, and especially to the end that good may become the person's own, which is accomplished 
in an evening state through delight. </p>

`In dare Jehovam vobis in vespera carnem ad edendum': quod significet quod in fine status bonum appropriabitur per jucundum, constat ex significatione `vesperae' quod sit finis status, de qua supra 
n. 8426, ex significatione `carnis' quod sit proprium vivificatum, seu proprium caeleste quod homini a Domino, ita bonum amoris, de qua n. 148, 149, 780, 3813, 7850, 8409 princ., hic autem bonum fidei, 
quia erat caro avis seu volatilis quod vocatur `selav'; per `volatile' enim significatur spirituale seu quod fidei est, inde per carnem ejus tale bonum, hic {1} bonum naturalis hominis, {2}seu jucundum; 
sciendum quod per `mannam' significetur bonum interni seu spiritualis hominis, at per `selav' bonum externi seu naturalis hominis, {3}quod vocatur jucundum; quod illa significentur, constat ex eo 
quod manna data tempore matutino, selav autem tempore vespertino, et per illud quod datum est tempore matutino, significatur bonum spirituale, et quod datum tempore vespertino, significatur bonum naturale 
seu jucundum; nam status mane in altera vita est cum bonum spirituale seu {4}interni hominis in claro est, ac bonum naturale seu externi hominis in obscuro, at status vesperae est cum bonum naturale 
seu externi hominis in claro est, ac bonum spirituale seu interni hominis in obscuro; succedunt {5}etiam sic vices, ob causam ut perficiatur homo {6}, imprimis ut approprietur ei bonum, quod fit
