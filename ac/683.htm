<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第683节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>683．至于动词“行”用了两次，包含善与真。当知道，在圣言中，尤其是先知书中，一件事可以两种方式来描述。如以赛亚书：<br />他坦然前行，他的脚好像没有踏着道路一样。谁作这事而成就它？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.3.htm">41:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处首先论及良善，其实论及真理，也就是说，首先论及意愿之物，其次论及觉知之物。因此，“他坦然前行”牵涉意愿之物，“他的脚好像没有踏着道路一样”牵涉觉知之物。“作”和“成就”也一样。在圣言中，属于意愿和觉知，即爱与信之物，或也可说，属天之物和属灵之物，以这样一种方式结合起来，以便每一个事物里面都有一个婚姻的样式，并与天堂的婚姻发生关联。此处重复使用一个词，也是如此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]683.</strong> Again, the double mention of did means that it involves both. In this connection, it needs to be realized that the Word, especially in the prophets, describes a single phenomenon in two ways. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />He has passed by in peace; he did not tread the path with his feet. Who has managed and done it? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_683/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_41_3-4" target=_top>Isaiah 41:3-4</a>)<br />One expression looks to good, the other to truth. In other words, one looks to what exists in the will, the other to what exists in the intellect. So passing by in peace involves qualities of the will, not treading the path with his feet qualities of the intellect. The same holds for managing and doing.<br />This is how the Word ties together the properties of the will and those of the intellect, that is, those of love and those of faith, or in other words, heavenly attributes and spiritual ones. At each point it achieves a kind of marriage and a reflection of the heavenly marriage. The repetition of a single word here achieves the same purpose. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 683</b></p><p><b>683.</b>
As regards the repetition of "did" that it involves both [good and truth], it should be known that in the Word, especially in the Prophets, one thing is described in a twofold manner. Thus in Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    He passed through in peace, a way that He had not gone with his feet; who hath wrought and done it? (Isa. 41:3-4), where one expression relates to good, and the other to truth; or, one relates 
to what is of the will, and the other to what is of the understanding; that is to say, "he passed over in peace" involves what is of the will, and "away he had not gone with his feet" involves what is 
of the understanding; and it is the same with the words "wrought" and "done." Thus the things that pertain to the will and to the understanding, or to love and faith, or what is the same, celestial 
and spiritual things, are so conjoined together in the Word that in each and every thing there is a likeness of a marriage, and a relation to the heavenly marriage. It is so here, in that the one word 
is repeated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 683</b></p><p><b>683.</b>
As regards the use twice of the verb 'did' comprehending both good and truth, it should be recognized that in the Word, especially the Prophets, one matter may be described in two ways, as in Isaiah, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
He has passed on in peace, a way He has not gone with His feet. Who has performed and done this? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the first statement has regard to good, the second to truth, that is to say, 
the first regards things of the will, the second those of the understanding. Thus 'passing on in peace' embodies things of the will, 'a way he did not go with His feet' those of the understanding. The 
same applies to 'performing' and 'doing'. In the Word things that belong to the will and to the understanding, that is, to love and faith - or what amounts to the same, celestial things and spiritual 
things - are joined together in such a way that each individual part images a marriage, and answers to the heavenly marriage. The same applies here with the repetition of the same verb. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 683</b>
</p><b>683.</b>
Quod 'bis (x)dicitur fecit' involvat utrumque, sciendum quod in Verbo, cumprimis apud Prophetas, una res dupliciter describatur, sicut apud Esaiam, 	Transivit pace, viam pedibus suis non ivit: quis 
operatus est et fecit? xli 3, 4; </p>
<p>ubi tamen unum spectat bonum, alterum autem veram; seu unum quae voluntatis, alterum quae intellectus; ita 'transire pace' involvit quae voluntatis; 'viam pedibus non 
ire' quae intellectus; similiter 'operari' et 'facere': ita conjunguntur in Verbo illa quae sunt voluntatis et intellectus, seu quae sunt amoris et fidei, seu quod idem, caelestia et spiritualia, ut 
in singulis sit instar conjugii seque referant ad conjugium caeleste: hic similiter, quod vox una repetatur. </p>
