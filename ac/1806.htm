<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1806节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1806.</strong>“于是带他到外面”表内层人的视觉，它通过外在事物看到内在事物。这从“带到外面”的含义，以及下文清楚可知。当有人用肉眼观看星空，由此思想主的国度时，内在事物就被“带出来”。每当人用肉眼看到事物，然而又仿佛没有看到他所看到之物，而是通过它们看见或思及属教会或天堂之物时，他的内在视觉，即他的灵或灵魂的视觉就被“带到外面”。严格来说，肉眼本身无非是其灵的视觉被“带到外面”，目的是让他可以通过外在事物看到内在事物；也就是说，是为了他能通过世上的物体不断认真思考来世的物体，因为他在世的生活是为了来世的生活。这就是上古教会的视觉；这就是与人同在的天使的视觉；这就是主的视觉。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1806.</strong> Leading him outside symbolizes the eyesight of the intermediate self, which views the inner reaches from the outer. This can be seen from the symbolism of leading someone outside and also from what follows. Our inner depths are led outside when we contemplate the starry sky with our physical eyes and allow it to direct our thoughts to the Lord's kingdom. Our inner sight — the sight of our spirit or soul — is led outside whenever we view something with our eyes and it essentially disappears as it leads us to "see" or think about aspects of religion or aspects of heaven. The eye itself is really just the sight of the spirit itself led outdoors. In fact its main purpose is for us to see inner realities from outward objects. In other words, the aim, as we look at objects in the world around us, is for us to reflect constantly on everything that exists in the other life, since that life is the goal of our life in the world. That is how the earliest church looked at things; that is how the angels with us look at things; and that is how the Lord looked at things. </p>

He led him forth abroad. That this signifies the sight of the interior man which from things external sees things internal, may be seen from the signification of "leading forth abroad," in connection 
with what follows. Things internal are led forth, when with the eyes of the body a man contemplates the starry heaven, and thence thinks of the Lord's kingdom. Whenever a man sees anything with his eyes, 
and sees the things that he looks upon as if he saw them not, but from them sees or thinks of the things which are of the church or of heaven, then his interior sight, or that of his spirit or soul, 
is "led forth abroad." The eye itself is properly nothing but the sight of his spirit led forth abroad, and this especially to the end that he may see internal things from external; that is, that 
he may, from the objects in the world, reflect continually upon those which are in the other life; for this is the life for the sake of which he lives in the world. Such was the sight in the Most Ancient 
Church; such is the sight of the angels who are with man; and such was the Lord's sight. </p>

That 'He brought him outside' means the sight possessed by the Interior Man, which from external things sees internal things, becomes clear from the meaning of 'bringing outside' and at the same time 
from what follows next. Internal things are 'brought out' when someone looks with his physical eyes at the starry sky and from this thinks about the Lord's kingdom. Whenever a person sees anything with 
his eyes, yet so to speak does not see the things he sees, but from them sees or thinks of the things that belong to the Church or to heaven, his interior sight, that is, the sight of his spirit or 
soul, is being 'brought outside'. Strictly speaking the eye itself is nothing else than the sight of the spirit itself 'brought outside', the specific purpose of this being that from external things 
a person may see internal things, that is, that from objects existing in the world he may reflect continually on things that exist in the next life, for it is for the sake of that life that he lives in 
the world. Such was the sight of the Most Ancient Church; such is the sight of angels who reside with man; and such was the Lord's sight. </p>

</p><b>1806.</b>
'Educens illum foras': quod significet Interioris Hominis visum qui ab externis videt interna, constare potest ex significatione 'educere foras,' et simul ex sequentibus; interna educuntur cum quis 
contemplatur oculis corporis caelum stelliferum et iride cogitat de regno Domini; quoties homo aliquid oculis suis videt, et illa quae videt sicut non videt, sed ex illis videt seu cogitat illa quae sunt 
Ecclesiae aut quae sunt caeli, tunc visus interior seu spiritus aut animae ejus 'educitur foras'; ipse oculus proprie non est aliud quam visus ipsius spiritus 'eductus foras,' et quidem ob finem imprimis 
ut ab externis videat interna, hoc est, ut ab objectis in mundo jugiter reflectat super illa quae sunt in altera vita, nam haec vita est propter quam vivit in mundo; talis fuit visus Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae; talis est visus angelorum apud hominem; et talis fuit visus Domini. </p>
