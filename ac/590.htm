<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第590节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>590.</strong>“后悔”与智慧有关，而“心中忧伤”与爱有关。除非参考人身上的事，从而借助表象，否则这一点无法解释清楚。构成人思想的每个想法都有来自觉知和意愿，即思想和爱的某种东西。无论什么想法，若不从意愿或爱吸取某种东西就不是一个想法，因为人不可能有其它思维方式。思想和意愿之间有一种永久的、牢不可破的密切结合，因此构成人思想的想法都有或粘附着属于意愿或爱的事物。人身上存在的这种情况能使人知道，更确切地说，似乎使得对构成主怜悯的东西，即爱与智慧形成某种观念成为可能。因此，先知书，尤其是以赛亚书对于一切事物几乎处处都是双重表述；一方面包含属灵之物，另一方面则包含属天之物，主怜悯的属灵层面就是智慧，属天层面则是爱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]590.</strong> The fact that regret has to do with wisdom, and heartfelt grief with love, cannot be explained clearly to people's understanding. It can only be explained in terms of human experience and so in terms of appearances.<br />Every concept in our thinking contains something of both intellect and will; to put it another way, it contains something of thought and of love for that thought. If an idea does not draw to some extent on the will, or on love in the will, it is not an idea, because without love we cannot think. There is a kind of marriage, perpetual and inviolable, between thought and will. So the contents of the will or the objects of love in the will are present within the ideas that make up our thinking, or are at least attached to them. From this human experience it seems more or less possible to know (or rather to grasp in some measure) what lies at the heart of the Lord's mercy: wisdom and love.<br />As a result, the prophets (especially Isaiah) almost everywhere use two terms for every concept, one involving a spiritual quality and the other a heavenly one.{*1} The spiritual aspect of the Lord's mercy is wisdom and its heavenly aspect is love.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For examples of the use in the prophets of two terms, one involving a spiritual quality and the other a heavenly, see the passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612" target=_top>612</a>, which include <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_psalms_15_1-2" target=_top>Psalms 15:1-2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_psalms_25_21" target=_top>25:21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_psalms_37_37" target=_top>37:37</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_58_2" target=_top>Isaiah 58:2</a>; the passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983" target=_top>983</a>, which include <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_3_14-16" target=_top>Jeremiah 3:14-16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_3" target=_top>23:3</a>; and the passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1259" target=_top>1259</a>, which include <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_2-3" target=_top>Isaiah 9:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_11_10-12" target=_top>11:10-12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_32" target=_top>14:32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_25_7" target=_top>25:7</a>.

That "repenting" has reference to wisdom, and "grieving at heart" to love, cannot be explained to human apprehension, save in accordance with the things that are with man, that is, by means of appearances. 
In every idea of thought in man there is something from the understanding and from the will, or from his thought and his love. Whatever idea does not derive anything from his will or love is not 
an idea, for otherwise than from his will he cannot think at all. There is a kind of marriage, perpetual and indissoluble, between the thought and the will, so that in the ideas of man's thought there 
inhere or adhere the things that are of his will or his love. From this state of things in man it may as it were be known, or rather it seems possible to form some idea of what is contained in the 
Lord's mercy, namely, wisdom and love. Thus in the Prophets, especially in Isaiah, there are almost everywhere double expressions concerning everything; one involving what is spiritual, the other what 
is celestial. The spiritual of the Lord's mercy is wisdom; the celestial is love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 590</b></p><p><b>590.</b>
'Repenting' has regard to wisdom, while 'grieving in heart' has regard to love. This cannot be explained intelligibly except by reference to the things that exist with man, and so by means of appearances. 
Every idea comprising a person's thought contains something from the understanding and something from the will, that is, something from his thinking and something from his love. Any idea which does 
not draw something from his will or love is not an idea, for there is no other possible manner in which he can think. A kind of permanent and indissoluble marriage exists between thought and will, 
so that inhering within or else adhering to the ideas comprising thought are the things which belong to his will or love. This situation existing with man enables one to know, or rather seems to make 
it possible to form some idea of what constitutes the Lord's mercy, namely wisdom and love. Thus in the Prophets, especially in Isaiah, dual expressions for everything occur almost everywhere, the one 
embodying what is spiritual, the other what is celestial. The spiritual side of the Lord's mercy is wisdom, the celestial side love.  </p>

</p><b>590.</b>
Quod 'paenitere' spectet sapientiam, et 'dolere ad cor' amorem, non potest explicari ad captum humanum, solum secundum ea quae apud hominem, ita per apparentias: unicuivis cogitationis ideae apud hominem 
est aliquid de intellectu et de voluntate, seu de cogitatione et de amore ejus; quae idea non trahit aliquid de voluntate seu amore ejus, non est idea, nam aliter nusquam cogitare potest; est perpetuum 
quoddam conjugium et indivulsum cogitationis et voluntatis, ita ideis cogitationis inhaerent aut adhaerent ea quae sunt voluntatis seu amoris ejus: ex hoc apud hominem sicut sciri, seu potius 
sicut idea aliqua capi, posse videtur quid misericordiae Domini inest, nempe sapientia et amor. Ita apud Prophetas, cumprimis apud Esaiam, fere ubivis sunt binae expressiones de quacumque re; una involvit 
spirituale, altera caeleste; spirituale misericordiae Domini est sapientia, caeleste est amor. </p>
