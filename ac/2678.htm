<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2678节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2678.</strong>“打发她走”表祂任由外在人沉浸在自我中。这从代表主的亚伯拉罕“打发走”的含义，以及那些正被改造和变得属灵之人的最初状态清楚可知。其状态就是，他们以为自己行出良善和思考真理靠的是他们自己，因而是靠的是他们自己的东西。处于这种状态下，他们不知道别的。当被告知，一切良善和一切真理皆源于主时，他们固然不拒绝这样的观念，然而他们没有发自内心接受它，因为他们没有觉得或从内心觉察到所流入事物来自他们自己，而非其它源头。这就是所有正被改造之人最初的状态，因此主任由他们沉浸在自我中。殊不知，他们是被他们的自我所引领。</p>

And sent her away. That this signifies that He left it in what is their own, is evident from the signification of "sending away," when done by Abraham, who represents the Lord; and also from the first 
state of those who are being reformed and are becoming spiritual. Their first state is that they suppose they do good and think truth from themselves, thus from what is their own, nor do they then know 
otherwise; and when told that all good and truth are from the Lord they do not indeed reject it, but do not acknowledge it at heart, because they do not feel it, nor interiorly perceive that anything 
flows in from any other source than themselves. As all who are being reformed are in such a state at first, they are therefore left by the Lord in what is their own; nevertheless they are led by means 
of this without knowing it. </p>

'He sent her away' means that He left the exterior man immersed in the proprium. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'being sent away' when this is done by Abraham, who represents the Lord; and also 
from the first state of those who are being reformed and becoming spiritual. Their first state is a state when they imagine that they do what is good and think what is true of themselves, thus from 
what is properly their own. Nor during this state do they know anything different. And when they are told that everything good and everything true originates in the Lord, they do not, it is true, reject 
the idea; yet they do not in their hearts accept it because they do not feel or inwardly perceive that anything flows in from any other source than themselves. Such being the state at first of all 
who are being reformed, the Lord therefore leaves them immersed in the proprium. Nevertheless without their knowing it they are led by means of their proprium. </p>

</p><b>2678.</b>
Quod `emisit illam' significet quod in proprio relinqueret, constare potest a significatione `emitti' cum hoc ab Abrahamo, per quem repraesentatur Dominus; tum a statu eorum primo qui reformantur et 
spirituales fiunt; status eorum primus est quod putent se bonum agere et verum cogitare ex semet, ita ex proprio, tunc nec aliter sciunt; ac cum iis dicitur quod omne bonum et omne verum a Domino, id 
quidem non rejiciunt sed non corde agnoscunt, quia non sentiunt nec interius percipiunt quod aliquid `aliunde influat' quam a semet; quia in tali statu omnes sunt primum qui reformantur, ideo a Domino 
relinquuntur in proprio, sed usque, iis nescientibus, per proprium suum ducuntur. </p>
