<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10550节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10550</strong>.“望着摩西，直等到他进了会幕”表他们看见圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，但它超出了他们所能理解的范畴。这从“望着摩西”和“直等到他进了会幕”的含义清楚可知：“望着摩西”是指看见圣言的外在意义，因为“摩西”表示圣言（参看<a href="10549.htm">10549</a>节）；“望着摩西”表示看见它的外在意义，因为前面的东西表示里面的东西，背后的东西表示外面的东西；因此，看见耶和华的背，看不见祂的脸表示看见外在之物，看不见内在之物，如本章最后一切所示。“直等到他进了会幕”是指它超出他们所能理解的范畴，因为当他进去时，不再被看见。</p>

And looked after Moses, until he had entered into the tent. That this signifies that they see the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, but that it vanishes from their apprehension, is 
evident from the signification of "looking after Moses" as being to see the external of the Word; for by "Moses" is signified the Word (see n. 10549); and by "looking after him" is signified to see its 
external; for that which is before signifies that which is within; and that which is after signifies that which is without; consequently to see the back parts of Jehovah, and not the face, denotes 
to see what is external and not what is internal, as shown in the last verse of this chapter. And from the signification of "until he had entered into the tent," as being to vanish from their apprehension; 
for when he entered he was no longer seen. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10550</b></p><p><b>10550.</b>
'And looked after Moses until he had entered the tent' means that they see the external aspect of the Word, the Church, and worship, but that it goes beyond what they are capable of understanding. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'looking after Moses' as seeing the external aspect or outward sense of the Word (the Word is meant by 'Moses', as above in <a href="10549.htm">10549</a>, and seeing its outward sense by 'looking 
after him'; for what is in front means what is inside, and what is at the back means what is outside, so that seeing Jehovah's back parts and not His face means seeing what is external and not what 
is internal, which is dealt with at the final verse of the present chapter); and from the meaning of 'until he had entered the tent' as its going beyond what they are capable of understanding, for when 
he went into it he was no longer visible.  </p>

</p><b>10550.</b>
`Et spectarunt post Moschen usque dum intraret in tentorium':  quod significet quod externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus videant, sed quod evanescat ex captu eorum, constat ex significatione `spectare 
post Moschen' quod sit videre externum Verbi; per `Moschen' {1} significatur Verbum, ut supra n. 10549, et per `spectare post illum' significatur videre externum ejus; nam quod ante est significat 
quod intra est, et quod post est significat quod extra est; inde videre posteriora Jehovae et non facies est videre externum et non internum, de quibus ad versum ultimum hujus capitis; et ex significatione 
`usque dum intraret in tentorium' quod sit quod evanescat e captu illorum, nam cum intrabat, non amplius videbatur. @1 i enim$ </p>
