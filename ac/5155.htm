<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5155节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5155.</strong>“法老必将你的头提起离开你身上”表基于预见的决定。这从“将头提起离开”的含义清楚可知：“将头提起离开”是指已经预备并因此决定的事，或基于预备的决定，如前所述（<a href="5124.htm">5124</a>节）；但此处是指基于预见的决定，是因为接下来就预言了膳长要被挂在木头上，以此表示抛弃和定罪。之所以表示基于预见，而非基于预备的决定，是因为预备论及良善，而预见论及邪恶。事实上，一切良善皆从主流入，因而是主所预备的；而一切邪恶皆从地狱流入，也就是从与地狱构成一体的人的自我流入，因而是主所预见的。对于邪恶，神意无非是将邪恶导向相对温和的邪恶，并尽可能地导向良善；而邪恶本身是可预见的。由于此处的主题是受意愿部分支配的感官能力，以及由于邪恶而对它的抛弃，所以所指的是预见。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5155</b></p><p><b>5155.</b>
Shall Pharaoh lift off thy head from upon thee. That this signifies what is concluded from what is foreseen, is evident from the signification of "lifting off the head," as being what is provided and 
therefore concluded, or what is concluded from what is provided (of which above, n. 5124); but here from what is foreseen, because the statement follows that the baker should be hanged upon wood, by 
which is signified rejection and damnation.  The reason why what is concluded from what is foreseen (not from what is provided), is signified is that providence is predicated of good, but foresight of 
evil; for all good flows in from the Lord, and therefore this is provided; but all evil is from hell, or from man's own which makes one with hell; and therefore this is foreseen. As regards evil, Providence 
is nothing but the direction or determination of evil to less evil, and as far as possible to good; but the evil itself is foreseen. In the present instance it is foresight that is signified, 
because the subject treated of is the sensuous that is subject to the will part and its rejection on account of evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5155</b></p><p><b>5155.</b>
'Pharaoh will lift up your head from upon you' means a decision based on foresight. This is clear from the meaning of 'lifting up the head' as that which has been provided and therefore has been decided, 
or a decision based on providence, dealt with above in <a href="5124.htm">5124</a>; but here a decision based on foresight is meant because the prediction follows that he would be hanged on wood, by which a casting aside 
and condemnation are meant. The reason why a decision based on foresight, not on providence, is meant is that providence is used with reference to good but foresight with reference to evil. For all 
good flows in from the Lord and is therefore what is provided by Him; but all evil flows from hell, that is, from the human proprium which makes one with hell, and is therefore what is foreseen by Him. 
In its dealings with evil, providence is nothing else than the directing and steering of evil towards a milder evil, and so far as possible towards good; but evil itself is foreseen. Since therefore 
the subject at this point is the sensory power subject to the will part and the casting aside of this on account of evil, it is foresight that is meant. </p>

</p><b>5155.</b>
`Extollet Pharaoh caput tuum e super te quod significet conclusum ex praeviso, constat ex significatione `extollere caput quod sit provisum et inde conclusum, seu conclusum ex proviso, de qua supra 
n. 5124, hic autem ex praeviso quia sequitur quod `suspenderetur super ligno', per quod significatur rejectio et damnatio; causa quod (o)conclusum ex praeviso, non autem ex proviso, significetur, 
est quia providentia praedicatur de bono, at praevidentia de malo; omne enim bonum influit a Domino, quapropter id providetur, at omne malum ab inferno seu a proprio hominis quod unum facit cum inferno, 
quapropter id praevidetur; providentia circa malum non aliud est quam directio seu determinatio mali ad minus malum et quantum possibile ad bonum, at ipsum malum praevidetur; hic itaque quia 
agitur de sensuali parti voluntariae subjecto et ejus rejectione propter malum, est praevidentia quae significatur. </p>
