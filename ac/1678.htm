<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1678节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1678.</strong>“他们转回，来到安密巴，就是加低斯”表继续。这从上下文清楚可知。此处的主题是虚假和源于它们的邪恶，“亚玛力人”表示虚假，“住在哈洗逊他玛的亚摩利人”表示源于它们的邪恶。“加低斯”既表真理，也表涉及真理的争竞。因为虚假和源于它们的邪恶，也就是主在祂第一次争战中所要战胜的，是此处论述的主题，故经上说“安密巴，就是加低斯”，因为那里有涉及真理的争竞。<br />“加低斯”表涉及真理的争竞，这清楚可见于以西结书，那里描述了圣地的边界：<br />南界是从他玛到米利巴加低斯的水，延及大海，这是南方向阳的边界。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.19.htm">47:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.28.htm">48:28</a>）<br />此处“南方”表真理之光。它的边界表涉及真理的争竞，被称为“加低斯”。<br />加低斯也是摩西击打磐石、水就从中流出的地方，那水因那里的击打而被称为“米利巴”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.1.htm">20:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.13.htm">13</a>） 。“磐石”表示主，如众所周知的；就圣言的内义而言，“水”表属灵事物，也就是真理。它们被称为“米利巴水”，是因为与它们有过争竞。它们还被称为“加低斯米利巴水”，这清楚可见于摩西书：<br />因为你们在寻的旷野，当会众争闹的时候，违背了我的命令，没有在涌水之地、会众眼前尊我为圣。这水就是寻的旷野加低斯米利巴水。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民27.14.htm">27:14</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.51.htm">32:51</a>）<br />探子从迦南地回来同样到了加低斯，加低斯是以色列因愿进入那地而起争竞的地方（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.26.htm">13:26</a>）。<br />从这些事明显可知，“安密巴”或“审判之泉”（ Fountain of Judgment），或“安密巴-加低斯的泉水”（Fountain of Mishpat-Kadesh）表涉及真理的争竞，因而表继续。由于这里的细节是真实的历史，因而描述了实际事件，故基大老玛所去的地方和他所杀败的各民族看似并非代表和表示这类事物。然而，在圣言中，所有历史细节都具有代表性，并具有属灵之义，这既适用于地方和民族，也适用于既成事实，这从圣言的历史和预言部分明显看出来。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1678.</strong> The meaning of they turned back and came into En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) as a continuation can be seen from what precedes and from what follows. The current theme is falsity and the evil in which it results. The Amalekite symbolizes falsity and the Amorite in Hazazon-tamar symbolizes the resulting evil.<br />Kadesh symbolizes truth, but also disputes about truth. The theme here is falsity and the evil it results in, which the Lord overcame the first time he contended against it, so the present verse mentions En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), since there was strife over the truth.<br />[2] The symbolism of Kadesh as truth under dispute is visible in Ezekiel, where the borders of the [visionary] holy land are defined:<br />The southern side toward the south will be from Tamar all the way to the waters of Meriboth- [quarrels of] kadesh,{*1} the inheritance at the Great Sea, and [this will be] the southern side toward the south. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_19" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_48_28" target=_top>48:28</a>)<br />The south stands for the light of truth. The boundary of the place, which means quarreling over truth, is called Kadesh.<br />[3] Kadesh was also the place where Moses struck the rock from which water gushed, and the water was called Meribah from [a word meaning] quarrels (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_numbers_20_1-2" target=_top>Numbers 20:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_numbers_20_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_numbers_20_13" target=_top>13</a>). A rock symbolizes the Lord, as is known.{*2} Water, on the Word's inner plane, symbolizes what is spiritual, or truth. It is called the water of Meribah because of the strife over it. The fact that it was also called "the water of quarreling in Kadesh" is clear in Moses:<br />You rebelled against what I said in the wilderness of Zin, in the quarreling of the congregation: that you should consecrate me with the water in view of them. This was the water of quarreling in Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_numbers_27_14" target=_top>Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_51" target=_top>Deuteronomy 32:51</a>)<br />Likewise Kadesh was where the scouts returned to from the land of Canaan and where [the people] murmured and bickered, not wanting to enter the land (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_26" target=_top>Numbers 13:26</a>).<br />[4] This evidence shows that En-mishpat (that is, Fountain of Judgment), or the Fountain of Mishpat (or Kadesh), symbolizes disputes over truth and so means a continuation.<br />Since the history here is real history and happened as described, it may seem as though such things could not be represented or symbolized by the places Chedorlaomer came to or by the nations he struck. But all the history in the Word 钬?the places, the nations, the events 钬?represents and symbolizes something, as is obvious from all the details in both the narrative and prophetic parts of the Word.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This bracketed gloss is Swedenborg's. The name of the place is Meriboth-kadesh, and "Meriboth" (诪职专执讬讘谠止转 [m菨r卯岣嚸瘁汞]) means "quarrels of" in Hebrew. Schmidt 1696 offers the same gloss in his translation. "Meriboth" is a plural form; the singular is "Meribah" (诪职专执讬讘指讛 [m菨r卯岣嚹乚), mentioned just below. [LHC]<br />{*2} Scripture very often refers to God as a rock, directly or obliquely; see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_4" target=_top>Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_15" target=_top>15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_30-31" target=_top>30-31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_22_2-3" target=_top>2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_22_32" target=_top>32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_23_3" target=_top>23:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_psalms_18_2" target=_top>Psalms 18:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_psalms_18_31" target=_top>31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_psalms_31_2-3" target=_top>31:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_psalms_62_2" target=_top>62:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_psalms_62_6-7" target=_top>6-7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_17_10" target=_top>Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_26_4" target=_top>26:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_29" target=_top>30:29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_44_8" target=_top>44:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_1-corinthians_10_4" target=_top>1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1678/bible_king-james-version_1-peter_2_4-8" target=_top>1 Peter 2:4-8</a>.

They returned and came to En-mishpat, this is Kadesh. That this signifies a continuation, is evident from what goes before, and from what follows. Here now the falsities and the evils derived from them 
are treated of. The falsities are signified by "the Amalekite," and the evils that were derived from them are signified by "the Amorite in Hazezon-tamar." By "Kadesh" are signified truths, and also 
contentions about truths. Because the falsities, and the evils derived from them which the Lord conquered in His first combat, are here treated of, it is here said, "En-mishpat, this is Kadesh," because 
there was contention about truths.  [2] That "Kadesh" signifies truths concerning which there is contention, is evident in Ezekiel, where the boundaries of the Holy Land are described: </p>
<p>     The 
corner of the south southward from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth (contentions) Kadesh, an inheritance to the great sea, and the corner of the south southward (Ezek. 47:19; 48:28) where "the 
south" denotes the light of truth; its boundary, by which is signified contention about truths, is called "Kadesh."  [3] Kadesh also was where Moses smote the rock, out of which waters came forth, which 
waters were called Meribah, from contention (Num. 20:1-2, 11, 13). By a "rock," as is known, the Lord is signified; by "waters," in the internal sense of the Word, are signified spiritual things, 
which are truths; they were called "the waters of Meribah" because there was contention about them. That they were also called "the waters of the contention of Kadesh," is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye rebelled 
against My mouth in the wilderness of Zin, in the contention of the assembly, to sanctify Me by the waters in their eyes. These are the waters of contention of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin 
(Num. 27:14; Deut. 32:51). So too it was to Kadesh that the spies returned from the land of Canaan, and Kadesh was the place where the Israelites murmured and contended, not being willing to enter into 
the land (Num. 13:26). [4] It is evident from these things that "En-mishpat," or "the Fountain of Judgment," or "the Fountain of Mishpat-Kadesh," signifies contention about truths, and thus a continuation. 
As these are true historicals, and this occurred just as is here stated, it may appear as if such things were not represented and signified by the places to which Chedorlaomer came, and by the 
nations that he smote; but all the historicals in the Word are representative and significative, both those relating to places and nations, and also those relating to things done; as may be clearly 
seen from all things in both the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1678</b></p><p><b>1678.</b>
That 'they returned and came to An-mishpat, that is, to Kadesh' means a continuation is clear from what comes before and after. The subject at this point is falsities and derivative evils, falsities 
being meant by 'the Amalekites' and derivative evils by 'the Amorites in Hazezon-tamar'. 'Kadesh' means truths, and also strife over truths. The subject at this point being the falsities and derivative 
evils which the Lord overcame in the first of His conflicts, the expression 'An-mishpat, that is, Kadesh' is used, for there was strife over truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'Kadesh' means truths over which there 
is strife is clear in Ezekiel where the boundaries of the Holy Land are described, </p>
<blockquote>
The corner of the south southwards will be from Tamar to the waters of Meriboth (strife) Kadesh. an inheritance 
towards the Great Sea, and the corner of the south southwards. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:19;%2048:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:19; 48:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the south' stands for the light of truth. Its boundary, by which strife over truths is meant, is called 'Kadesh'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Kadesh was also the place where Moses struck the rock from which water came out, water that was called Meribah on account of the strife there, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2020:1,%202,%2011,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 20:1, 2, 11, 13</a>. 'A rock', as is well known, 
means the Lord, and 'water' in the internal sense of the Word means spiritual things, which are truths. They were called 'the waters of Meribah' because there was strife over them The fact that 
they were also called 'the waters of the strife of Kadesh' is clear in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You rebelled against My Word<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, in that you sanctified Me 
by the waters in their eyes. These are the waters of the strife of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2027:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 27:14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:51&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:51</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It was likewise to Kadesh that the spies returned from the land of Canaan, 
and it was there that those who were unwilling to enter the land murmured and strove, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From these references it is clear that An-mishpat, or the fountain of judgement or the fountain 
of Mishpat-Kadesh, means strife over truths, and thus a continuation. Since the details here are historically true and so describe actual events, it may seem as though such things were not represented 
or meant by the places which Chedorlaomer came to and by the nations that he smote. All historical details in the Word however are representative and carry a spiritual meaning, and this applies 
both to places and to nations, and to accomplished facts as well, as becomes quite clear from everything that appears both in the historical and the prophetical sections of the Word.

'Reversi sunt et venerunt in {1} En-mishpat, haec Kadesh': quod significet continuationem, constat ab illis quae praecedunt et illis quae sequuntur; agitur hic nunc de falsis et malis inde; falsa significantur 
per 'Amalekitam,' et mala inde per 'Emoraeum Hazezon-tamar':  per 'Kadesh' significantur vera, tum quoque contentiones de veris; hic quia de falsis, et de malis inde, agitur, quae evicit Dominus 
in prima sua pugna, hic nominatur 'En-mishpat haec Kadesh' quia contentio fuit de veris.  [2] Quod 'Kadesh' significet vera de quibus contenditur, constat apud Ezechielem ubi termini Terrae Sanctae 
describuntur, 	Angulus meridiei versus austrum, a Tamar usque ad aquas Meriboth (contentionum) Kadeshum, hereditatem ad mare magnum, et angulum austri versus meridiem, xlvii 19; xlviii 28; </p>
<p>ubi 
'meridies' pro luce veritatis; terminus ejus quo significatur contentio de veris, dicitur 'Kadesh.'  [3] Kadesh quoque fuit ubi  	Moses percussit petram, e qua exiverunt aquae, quae aquae vocatae sunt 
Meribah ex contentione, Num. xx 1, 2, 11, 13; </p>
<p>per 'petram,' ut notum, significatur Dominus, per 'aquas' in sensu interno Verbi, spiritualia quae sunt vera: 'aquae Meribah' dictae quia de illis contentio:

Kadesh deserti Zin, Num. xxvii 14; Deut. xxxii 51. Similiter fuit in Kadesh, quo reversi exploratores e terra Canaane, et ubi murmurarunt et contenderunt, non volentes intrare in terram, Num. 
xiii 26.  [4] Ex his constat quod 'En-mishpat' seu fons judicii aut fons Mishpat Kadesh significet contentionem de veris, et sic continuationem.  Quia hic historica vera sunt ac ita factum, apparere 
potest sicut non talia repraesentata sint et significata per loca quo venit, et per gentes quas percussit Kedorlaomer; sed historica omnia in Verbo sunt repraesentativa et significativa, tam quoad loca 
quam quoad gentes, ut et quoad facta, ut manifeste constare potest ab omnibus tam in historicis Verbi quam in propheticis. 	@1 So I, but ad elsewhere.$ </p>
