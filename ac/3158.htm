<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3158节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3158.</strong>“就告诉我；若不然，也告诉我”表他们可以自由考虑的状态。这从这些话本身明显看出来。从前文清楚可知，本章在字义上论述的是利百加和以撒的订婚和结婚，而在内义上论述的是真理被引入良善并与其联结，因为真理被引入良善并与其联结是属灵的订婚和属灵的结婚。这两种情况都需要自由考虑的状态，众所周知，这在订婚和结婚的事上是有必要的；但在真理被引入良善并与其联结这样的事上也需要，就不那么为人所知了。因为这不为属世人所见，并且这种引入和联结属于无需人的反思就能实现的事之一。然而，这种活动在正经历改造和重生的人里面每时每刻都在进行。也就是说，当真理正与良善联结时，他处于自由的状态。<br />只要想一想，谁都能知道，任何事物若不形成人的意愿部分，就不会作为人自己的东西存在。唯独属于理解力的事物不会变成人自己的东西，因为属于意愿的事物构成一个人生命的本质存在，而属于理解力的事物则构成那本质存在的显现。唯独从理解力流入的同意不是同意，一切同意皆来自意愿。因此，属于理解力的信之真理若不被属于意愿的爱之良善接受，就绝不是被承认的真理，因而不是信。自由的状态有必要存在，好叫真理被属于意愿的良善接受。属于意愿的一切看上去都是自由的；意愿的真正状态就是自由；我选择、我渴望我所愿的，因为我爱它，视之为良善。所有这一切表明，信之真理绝不会变成人自己的东西，除非它已被意愿接受，也就是被引入那里的良善并与其联结；这一切若不在自由的状态下是不可能发生的。</p>

Tell me; and if not, tell me. That this signifies their free state of deliberation, is evident from the sense of the words. From all that precedes it is evident that the words which in the sense of the 
letter in this chapter treat of the betrothal and marriage of Rebekah with Isaac, in the internal sense treat of the initiation and conjunction of good and truth; for the initiation and conjunction 
of good and truth are spiritual betrothal and spiritual marriage. In each there is required a free state of deliberation. That this is necessary in betrothal and marriage, is well known; but that it 
is required in the initiation and conjunction of good and truth, is not so well known, because it is not apparent to the natural man, and because such initiation and conjunction are among the things that 
are accomplished without man's reflecting upon them; nevertheless during every moment when man is being reformed and regenerated, it comes to pass that he is in a state of freedom when truth is being 
conjoined with good. [2] Everyone may know, if he only considers, that nothing is ever man's, as his, unless it is of his will; what is only of the understanding does not become man's until it becomes 
of the will also; for what is of the will constitutes the being [esse] of a man's life; but what is of the understanding constitutes the coming forth [existere] of his life thence derived. Consent 
from the understanding alone is not consent, but all consent is from the will; wherefore unless the truth of faith which is of the understanding is received by the good of love which is of the will, 
it is not at all truth which is acknowledged, and thus it is not faith. But in order that truth may be received by the good which is of the will, it is necessary that there be a free state. All that 
is of the will appears free; the very state of willing is liberty; for that which I will, that I choose, that I long for, because I love it and acknowledge it as good. All this shows that truth, which 
is of faith, never becomes man's as his until it has been received by the will, that is, until it has been initiated and conjoined with the good there; and that this cannot be effected except in a free state. </p>

'Tell me; and if not, tell me' means a state in which they are free to deliberate. This is evident from the sense of the words themselves. From all that has gone before it is clear that while the sense 
of the letter in this chapter is dealing with the betrothal and marriage of Rebekah to Isaac, the internal sense is dealing with the introduction and joining together of truth and good, for the introduction 
and joining together of truth and good is spiritual betrothal and spiritual marriage. In both instances a free state to deliberate is necessary. The necessity for it in betrothal and marriage 
is well known, but the necessity for it in the introduction and joining together of truth and good is not so well known because it is not visible to the natural man and belongs among the things that 
go on quite apart from any reflecting on them. Yet this activity continues moment by moment in one who is being reformed and regenerated, that is to say, he experiences a free state when truth is being 
joined to good. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Everyone may know, if he merely stops to think, that nothing ever exists as a person's own unless it forms part of his will. That which belongs solely to the understanding does 
not become a person's own until it belongs also to his will, for what belongs to the will constitutes the essential being (esse) of a person's life, whereas what belongs to the understanding constitutes 
the manifestation (existere) of that essential being. Consent flowing from the understanding alone is not consent, but all consent springs from the will. Unless therefore the truth of faith which 
belongs to the understanding is received by the good of love which belongs to the will it is in no sense truth that has been acknowledged, and so is not faith. In order that it may be received by good 
that belongs to the will it is necessary that a free state should exist. Everything that belongs in the will looks to be free. The state itself of the will is freedom, for what I will, I choose and 
desire since that is what I love and acknowledge as that which is good. From this it becomes clear that the truth of faith in no sense becomes a person's own until it has been accepted by the will, that 
is, introduced and joined to the good there, which cannot happen except in a free state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3158</b>
</p><b>3158.</b>
`Indicate mihi, et si non, indicate mihi': quod significet deliberationis eorum statum liberum, patet ex sensu verborum. Ex omnibus quae praecedunt, constat quod quae in sensu litterae in hoc capite 
agunt de desponsatione et conjugio Rebeccae cum Jishako, in sensu interno agant de initiatione et conjunctione (t)boni et veri, est enim initiatio et conjunctio veri et boni spiritualis desponsatio et 
spirituale conjugium: utrobivis requiritur deliberationis status liber; quod in desponsatione et conjugio, notum est, at quod in initiatione et conjunctione boni et veri, non ita notum est, quia non 
ad naturalem hominem apparet et quia inter illa sunt quae fiunt absque quod homo reflectat, usque tamen unoquovis momento existit, cum homo reformatur et regeneratur, nempe quod in statu libero sit, 
cum verum conjungitur bono. [2] Unusquisque scire potest, si modo expendat, quod nusquam aliquid sit hominis, ut ipsius, nisi sit ejus voluntatis; quod solum est intellectus, non fit hominis priusquam 
etiam fit ejus voluntatis, nam quae voluntatis sunt, constituunt hominis esse vitae, quae autem intellectus, constituunt ejus existere vitae inde; consensus ex solo intellectu non est consensus, sed 
omnis consensus est ex voluntate; quapropter nisi verum fidei quod est intellectus, recipiatur a bono amoris quod est voluntatis, nusquam est verum quod agnitum, ita non est fides; ut vero recipiatur 
a bono quod voluntatis, necessum est ut sit status liber; omne quod voluntatis est, hoc apparet liberum, ipse status voluntatis est libertas, nam quod volo, hoc eligo, hoc desidero, quia hoc amo et agnosco 
ut bonum; inde constare potest quod verum quod fidei, nusquam fiat hominis ut ipsius priusquam receptum est a voluntate, hoc est, initiatum et conjunctum bono ibi, et quod id non fieri possit nisi 
in statu libero. </p>
