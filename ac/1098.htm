<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1098节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1098.</strong>从以下分析清楚可知“闪”和“雅弗”表示什么，即谁是内在教会成员，谁是外在教会成员，并由此可知“迦南”表示什么：内在教会成员将他所行的一切良善和所思的一切真理都归于主；外在教会成员则没有这种认知，但仍会行善。内在教会成员使出于仁爱对主的敬拜，因而使内在敬拜成为必不可少的，而外在敬拜却没有那么必要；而外在教会成员使外在敬拜成为必不可少的，却不知道何为内在敬拜，哪怕他拥有内在敬拜。因此，内在教会成员认为，若不出于内在敬拜主，就是违背自己的良知；而外在教会成员则认为，若不恭敬地遵守外在仪式，就是违背自己的良知。内在教会成员的良知包含更多事物，因为他从圣言内义知道很多事；而外在教会成员的良知包含的事物较少，因为他从圣言内义知道很少事。前者，即内在教会成员，叫做“闪”，而后者，即外在教会成员，叫做“雅弗”。然而，凡使敬拜纯由外在构成，没有仁爱，因而没有良知之人，都叫做“迦南”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1098.</strong> Anyone who wants to know what Shem and Japheth are — that is, who the people of the inner and outer church are — and by extension what Canaan is, can see from the following.<br />People in the inner church attribute every good deed they do and every true thought they think to the Lord, but people in the outer church do not know they should do this, although they still do good deeds.<br />People in the inner church assign crucial importance to charity-based worship of the Lord and in fact to inner worship; outward worship they consider less important. People in the outer church assign crucial importance to outward worship, not knowing what inner worship is, although they do engage in it. So people of the inner church believe they are violating conscience if they do not worship the Lord from within, while people of the outer church believe they are violating conscience if they do not reverently observe the external rituals.<br />The conscience of a person in the inner church is well supplied, because such a person knows much about the Word's inner meaning. The conscience of a person in the outer church, on the other hand, is less well supplied, since such a person knows little about the Word's inner meaning.<br />The former (a person in the inner church) is the one called Shem, while the latter (a person in the outer church) is the one called Japheth. But an individual who considers worship exclusively a matter of outward acts, who possesses no charity and therefore no conscience, is called Canaan. </p>

What is meant by "Shem" and what by "Japheth" that is, who is a man of the internal church, and who is a man of the external church; and hence what is meant by "Canaan" will be evident from the following 
considerations. The man of the internal church attributes to the Lord all the good that he does, and all the truth that he thinks; but the man of the external church does not know how to do this, 
and yet does what is good. The man of the internal church makes the worship of the Lord from charity, thus internal worship, essential, and external worship not so essential; but the man of the external 
church makes external worship essential, and does not know what internal worship is, although he has it. And therefore the man of the internal church believes that he is acting against his conscience 
if he does not worship the Lord from what is internal; while the man of the external church believes that he is acting against his conscience if he does not sacredly observe external rites. There 
are many things in the conscience of the man of the internal church, because he knows many things from the internal sense of the Word; but there are fewer things in the conscience of the man of the external 
church, because he knows few things from the internal sense of the Word. The former, that is, the man of the internal church, is he who is called "Shem;" and the latter, that is, the man of the 
external church, is he who is called "Japheth." But he who makes worship consist only in externals, and has no charity, consequently no conscience, is called "Canaan." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1098</b></p><p><b>1098.</b>
What 'Shem' and 'Japheth' mean - that is, who the member of the internal Church is and who the member of the external - and from this what 'Canaan' means, becomes clear from the following considerations: 
The member of the internal Church ascribes to the Lord all the good he does and all the truth he thinks, whereas the member of the external Church has no knowledge of this but nevertheless does what 
is good. The member of the internal Church makes worship of the Lord from charity - and especially internal worship - the essential, and external worship not so essential. The member of the external 
Church makes external worship the essential. He does not know what internal worship is, even though he has it. Consequently the member of the internal Church believes that he is acting contrary to 
conscience if he does not worship the Lord from what is internal, whereas the member of the external Church believes he is acting contrary to conscience if he does not reverently observe external rites. 
The conscience of the member of the internal Church contains more things because he knows more things from the internal sense of the Word, whereas the conscience of the member of the external Church 
contains fewer because he knows few things from the internal sense of the Word. The former - the member of the internal Church - is called 'Shem', whereas the latter - the member of the external Church 
- is called 'Japheth'. The person however who makes worship consist solely in external things and who has no charity, and consequently no conscience, is called 'Canaan'.  </p>

</p><b>1098.</b>
Ut sciatur quid 'Shem' et quid 'Japheth,' hoc est, quis homo internae Ecclesiae et quis homo externae, et inde quid 'Canaan,' ex his constare potest.  Homo internae Ecclesiae Domino tribuit omne bonum 
quod facit et verum quod cogitat; homo autem externae Ecclesiae hoc ignorat, et usque facit bonum.  Homo internae Ecclesiae essentialem facit cultum Domini ex charitate et quidem                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                              insunt, quia pauca novit de sensu Verbi interno. Ille seu homo internae Ecclesiae est qui appellatur 'Shem'; 
hic autem seu homo externae Ecclesiae est qui appellatur 'Japheth': at qui solum in externis ponit cultum et nullam 'charitatem habet, proinde nullam conscientiam, is vocatur 'Canaan.' </p>
