<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1211节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1211.</strong>“迦南的边界是从西顿向基拉耳的路上，直到迦萨”表对真理和良善的认知朝那些具有缺乏内在的外在敬拜之人延伸。这从“基拉耳”和“迦萨”的含义清楚可知。无论外在的还是内在的，凡与敬拜相关的一切认知的边界，都会朝那个方向延伸；因为一切敬拜皆源于信和仁，否则就不是敬拜，而是偶像崇拜。由于此处论述的主题是迦南及其衍生，故这里所表示的不是敬拜的边界和延伸，而是认知的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1211.</strong> The border of the Canaanites reached from Sidon as you come to Gerar, as far as Gaza, symbolizes knowledge extending [to include the truth and goodness] in people who worship outwardly but not inwardly. This can be seen from the symbolism of Gerar and Gaza. The boundaries of all knowledge having to do with worship (whether it is shallow worship or deep) reach that far, because all worship comes from faith and charity. Any worship that does not come from them is not worship but idolatry.<br />Since the subject here is Canaan, that is, outward worship and the things that develop out of it, it is the boundaries and extent not of worship but of knowledge that are meant here. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1211</b></p><p><b>1211.</b>
The border of the Canaanites was from Zidon, in coming to Gerar, even unto Gaza. That this signifies the extension of knowledges with those who have external worship without internal, is evident from 
the signification of "Gerar" and of "Gaza." Thus far do the boundaries of all knowledges that relate to worship extend, whether that worship be external or internal; for all worship is from faith and 
charity. What is not from these is not worship, but is idolatry. As Canaan, that is, external worship and its derivations, is the subject here treated of, the boundaries and extensions meant are those 
not of worship, but of knowledges. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1211</b></p><p><b>1211.</b>
'The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you come to Gerar, as far as Gaza' means the extension of cognitions with those who have external worship devoid of internal. This is clear from the meaning 
of Gerar and Gaza. The borders to all cognitions that have regard to worship, whether external worship or internal, move in that direction, for all worship stems from faith and charity, and that 
which does not do so is not worship but idolatry. Because the subject is Canaan, that is, external worship and its derivations, it is not the limits and extension of worship but of cognitions that are 
meant here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1211</b>
</p><b>1211.</b>
'Quod terminus Canaanitarum fuerit a Zidone veniendo ad Gerar, usque ad Azzam' significant extensionem cognitionum apud eos qui cultum externum absque interno habent, a significatione Geraris et Azzae 
constat; termini omnium cognitionum quae spectant cultum, sive externus sit sive internus, illuc vadunt; nam omnis cultus est ex fide et charitate; qui non inde, non est cultus sed idololatria; quia 
de Canaane, hoc est, de cultu externo ejusque derivationibus agitur, non sunt cultus sed cognitionum termini et extensiones quae hic intelliguntur. </p>
