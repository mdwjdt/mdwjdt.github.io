<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5876节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5876.</strong>创世记45:3-5.约瑟对他弟兄们说，我是约瑟，我的父亲还活着吗？他弟兄不能回答他，因为他们在他面前都惊惶。约瑟又对他弟兄们说，请挨近我。他们就近前来，他说，我是你们的兄弟约瑟，就是你们所卖到埃及的。现在，不要因为把我卖到这里来忧伤，也不要眼里有恼怒；因为是为要使你们存活，神才差我在你们以先来的。<br />“约瑟对他弟兄们说”表内在属天层将觉知的能力赐予属世层中的真理。“我是约瑟”表揭示。“我的父亲还活着吗”表来自属世层的属灵良善的存在。“他弟兄不能回答他”表属世层中的真理还未处于能对话的状态。“因为他们在他面前都惊惶”表他们中间的动荡。“约瑟又对他弟兄们说”表对新属世层的觉知。“请挨近我”表更内在的交流。“他们就近前来”表结果。“他说，我是你们的兄弟约瑟”表通过流注所作的揭示。“就是你们所卖到埃及的”表他们所疏远的内在。“现在，不要忧伤”表心里或意愿中的焦虑。“也不要眼里有恼怒”表灵里或理解力中的悲伤。“因为把我卖到这里来”表他们（通过把它赶到最低部分）疏远它。“因为是为要使你们存活，神才差我在你们以先来的”表他们所领受的属灵生命是神所命定的。</p>

Verses 3-5. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were in consternation before him. And Joseph said unto his brethren, 
Come ye near to me I pray. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. And now be not grieved, neither let there be anger in your eyes, that ye sold me hither; 
for God did send me before you to make to live. "And Joseph said unto his brethren," signifies that the internal celestial gave the faculty of perception to truths in the natural; "I am Joseph," signifies 
manifestation; "doth my father yet live," signifies the presence of spiritual good from the natural; "and his brethren could not answer him," signifies that truths in the natural were not yet 
in a state to speak; "for they were in consternation before him," signifies commotion among them; "and Joseph said unto his brethren," signifies the perception of the new natural; "Come ye near to me 
I pray," signifies interior communication; "and they came near," signifies the effect; "and he said, I am Joseph your brother," signifies manifestation by means of influx; "whom ye sold into Egypt," signifies 
the internal which they had alienated; "and now be not grieved," signifies anxiety of the heart or of the will; "neither let there be anger in your eyes," signifies sadness of the spirit or of 
the understanding; "that ye sold me hither," signifies that they had alienated to the lowest things; "for God did send me before you to make to live," signifies spiritual life thence imparted to them 
of Providence. </p>

Verses 3-5 And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph. Is my father still alive? And his brothers could not answer him, for they were filled with dismay at his presence. And Joseph said to his brothers, 
Draw near to me, I beg you. And they drew near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. And now, do not be grieved, and do not have any anger in your eyes, that you sold 
me here; for God sent me before you for the bestowal of life. </p>
<p>'And Joseph said to his brothers' means that the internal celestial imparted a power of perception to the truths in the natural. 'I am 
Joseph' means a revelation. 'Is my father still alive?' means the presence of spiritual good from the natural. 'And his brothers could not answer him' means that the truths in the natural were not yet 
in a state of being able to talk. 'For they were filled with dismay at his presence' means turmoil among them. 'And Joseph said to his brothers' means the perception by a new natural. 'Draw near to 
me, I beg you' means a more internal communication. 'And they drew near' means the effect. 'And he said, I am Joseph your brother' means a revelation made by means of influx. 'Whom you sold into Egypt' 
means the internal which they had alienated. 'And now, do not be grieved' means anxiety in the heart or will. 'And do not have any anger in your eyes' means sadness in the spirit or understanding. 'That 
you sold me here' means that they had alienated [it by banishing it] to the lowest parts. 'For God sent me before you for the bestowal of life' means the spiritual life they received as ordained 
by Providence. </p>

Vers. 3-5.  Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego Joseph, an adhuc pater meus vivit? et non potuerunt fratres ejus respondere illi, quia consternati a coram illo. Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Accedite 
quaeso ad me, et accesserunt, et dixit, Ego Joseph frater vester, quem vendidistis me Aegyptum. Et nunc, ne dolori vobis sit, et ne irae sit in oculis vestris, quod vendideritis me huc, quia ad 
vivificationem misit me Deus ante vos. `Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos' significat quod caeleste internum daret perceptionis facultatem veris in naturali: `Ego Joseph' significat manifestationem: `an 
adhuc pater meus vivit' significat boni spiritualis e naturali praesentiam: `et non potuerunt fratres ejus respondere illi' significat quod vera in naturali nondum in statu loquendi essent: `quia consternati 
a coram illo' significat commotionem inter illa: `et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos' significat perceptionem novi naturalis: `Accedite quaeso ad me' significat communicationem interiorem: `et accesserunt 
significat effectum: `et dixit, Ego Joseph frater vester' significat manifestationem per influxum: `quem vendidistis me Aegyptum' significat internum quod abalienaverint: `et nunc ne dolori 
vobis sit' significat anxietatem cordis seu voluntatis: `et ne irae sit in oculis vestris' significat tristitiam spiritus seu intellectus: `quod vendideritis me huc' significat quod abalienaverint ad 
infima: `quia ad vivificationem misit me Deus (x)ante vos' significat vitam spiritualem inde illis ex Providentia. </p>
