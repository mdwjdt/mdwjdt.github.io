<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3086节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3086.</strong>为了对此处包含在内义中的事形成某种概念，哪怕最一般的概念，要知道，整个这一章都在论述要与神圣良善联结的神圣真理。也就是说，神圣良善流入属世人，即流入记忆知识、认知和那里的教义。这些属于属世人，因为它们在属世人的记忆里。神圣良善凭该流注给那里的一切事物带来光明和生命，并将其整理成序。因为属世人中的一切光明、生命和秩序皆由来自神性的流注产生。若稍稍留意这个问题，谁都能知道这一点。情感通过该流注产生，首先产生的是对真理的一般情感，也就是这两节所论述的情感：它的起源（<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>，<a href="3078.htm">3078</a>节）；它的性质（<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>-<a href="3081.htm">3081</a>节）；和它引入的初始阶段（<a href="3082.htm">3082</a>-<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>节）。但接下来的几节在内义上进一步描述了这个过程，也就是说，描述了对那真理的调查，以及来自母亲、一开始与其联结之物的分离，等等。<br />不过，我意识到这些秘密太过深奥，很难理解。 原因在于，如前所述，它们都是未知之事。尽管如此，由于内义描述了它们，并且描述得如此详细，所以它们必须被阐述出来，不管它们显得多么超出理解。至少能让人从中明白圣言的内义蕴含何等大的奥秘，以及那奥秘是诸如在人处于肉身时所在的尘世之光中几乎看不到的那一类；不过，随着人从尘世之光进入他死后所进入的天堂之光，因而进入幸福快乐的灵魂，即天使所在之光，它们会显得越来越清晰明了。</p>

That some idea, although a most general one, may be formed of what is here contained in the internal sense, be it known that this whole chapter treats of the truth Divine that was to be conjoined with 
the Divine good; to wit that Divine good flowed into the natural man, that is, into the memory-knowledges, the knowledges, and the doctrinal things therein, for these are of the natural man insofar 
as they are in its memory; and that by this influx it enlightened, vivified, and disposed into order all things therein; for all light, life, and order in the natural man are from influx from the Divine, 
as may be known to everyone if he attends to it. By means of this influx there comes forth affection; first, the general affection of truth, treated of in these two verses in regard to its origin 
(n. 3077, 3078); its quality (n. 3079-3081); and the first of initiation (n. 3082-3084); but in the verses now immediately following, the process is further described in the internal sense, namely, the 
exploration of that truth, also the separation of the things from the mother, which at first were adjoined to it, and so on. [2] But I know that these are arcana too deep to fall within apprehension; 
and this as before said for the reason that they are things unknown; but as the internal sense describes them, and this as to all their circumstances, they must needs be set forth, no matter how much 
they may appear to be above the apprehension. At the very least it may in this way be seen what great arcana there are in the internal sense of the Word; also that the arcana are such as scarcely to 
be seen in the light of the world, in which man is during his life in the body, but that they always appear more distinctly and clearly in proportion as man comes from the light of the world into the 
light of heaven, into which he comes after death; thus into the light in which blessed and happy souls are, that is, the angels. </p>

To have any idea at all, even a very general one, of the things contained here in the internal sense, it should be recognized that the whole of this chapter is dealing with Divine truth that was to be 
joined to Divine Good. That is to say, Divine Good flowed into the natural man, that is, into the facts, cognitions, and matters of doctrine there, for these belong to the natural man insofar as they 
are in his memory. And by means of that influx, Divine Good brought light and life, and ordered all that was there; for all light, life, and order in the natural man result from influx from the Divine, 
as anyone may know if he pays the matter any attention. By means of that influx affection comes into being, first of all a general affection for truth, the affection dealt with in these two verses 
- its origin, in <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, <a href="3078.htm">3078</a>; its nature, in <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>-<a href="3081.htm">3081</a>; and the initial stage of its introduction, in <a href="3082.htm">3082</a>-<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>. But the verses that follow directly after them, in the internal sense describe that process 
further, that is to say, investigation of that truth, and also the separation of the elements received from the mother which had been allied to it first of all, and so on. But I realize that these 
arcana are too deep to be understood easily, the reason being, as has been stated, that they are not known. Nevertheless since the internal sense describes them, and does so in great detail, what else 
is to be done but explain them, no matter how much they appear to be beyond human apprehension? At least one may see from this how deep the arcana are within the internal sense of the Word, and also 
that those arcana are such as to be hardly visible at all in the light of the world which man has during his lifetime, but that they are always seen more clearly and plainly to the extent that he passes 
from the light of the world into the light of heaven, the light into which he passes after death, and so sees in the light in which blessed and happy souls, that is, angels, dwell. </p>

Ut aliqua idea tametsi communissima, haberi queat de illis quae hic in sensu interno continentur, sciendum quod in toto hoc capite agatur de vero Divino quod conjungendum Divino Bono; quod nempe Divinum 
Bonum influxerit in naturalem hominem, hoc est, in scientifica, cognitiones et doctrinalia ibi, haec enim sunt naturalis hominis quatenus in memoria ejus, et quod per influxum illum omnia quae ibi, 
illustraverit, vivificaverit, et disposuerit in ordinem, omnis enim lux, vita et ordo in naturali homine est ex influxu ex Divino ut cuivis si attendit, notum esse potest; per influxum {1}illum existit 
affectio, primum affectio communis veri, de qua affectione in binis his versibus agitur, de ejus origine, n. 3077, 3078, de ejus quali, n. 3079-3081, de primo initiationis, n 3082-3084: in illis 
autem quae nunc immediate sequuntur, describitur in sensu interno processus ille ulterius, nempe exploratio illius veri, tum separatio maternorum quae primum ei adjuncta, et sic porro.  Sed scio quod 
haec arcaniora sint quam ut in captum cadant, et hoc ex causa, ut dictum, quia ignota; sed quia internus sensus illa describit, et hoc quoad omnes circumstantias, non potest aliter, utcumque apparitura 
sint super captum, quin exponantur; ad minimum inde videri potest quanta arcana in {2}Verbi sensu interno sunt, tum quod talia arcana sint, quae vix apparent in luce mundi, in qua homo est dum vivit 
in corpore, sed quod semper manifestius et clarius, quo a luce mundi venit in lucem caeli, in quam venit post mortem, ita in qua sunt animae beatae et felices, hoc est, angeli. @1 inde$ @2 after interno$ </p>
