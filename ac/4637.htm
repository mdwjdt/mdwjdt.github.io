<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4637.</strong>很明显，主在比喻中所提到的一切细节和每一个细节都代表并表示其国度的属天和属灵事物，在至高意义上代表并表示祂里面的神性事物。因此，人若不知道这一切，必将主的比喻视为普通的打比方，没有更深层次的东西在里面。十个童女的比喻必是这种情形，除非人们知道童女、十、五、灯、器皿、油、卖油的、婚筵，以及其它一切细节在内义上分别表示什么。其它比喻也一样。如前所述，就外在形式而言，主在这些比喻中所提到的细节看似普通的打比方；但就其内在形式而言，它们具有这样的性质：它们充满整个天堂。这是因为内义就包含在每个细节中，并且内义具有这样的性质：它的属灵和属天成分<br />就像光和火焰那样朝各个方向传遍天堂。内义完全优越于字义，并从每个词、每个字，甚至一点一划流出。我们从下文可以看出，这个比喻在内义上包含什么。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4637</b></p><p><b>4637.</b>
It is very evident that each and all things the Lord spoke in parables are representative and significative of the spiritual and celestial things of His kingdom, and in the highest sense, of the Divine 
things with Him; and therefore the man who does not know this must suppose that the Lord's parables have no more in them than ordinary comparisons. Such must be the case with the parable of the ten 
virgins unless it is known what is signified in the internal sense by the virgins, and also by ten and five, and by the lamps, the vessels, and the oil, and by them that sell, the wedding, and all the 
rest; and the same with all the other parables. The things which the Lord spoke in these parables appear in the outward form like ordinary comparisons; but in their inward form they are of such a nature 
as to fill the universal heaven. For there is an internal sense in every particular, which is of such a nature that its spiritual and celestial diffuses itself through the heavens in every direction 
like light and flame. This sense is quite uplifted above the sense of the letter, and flows from the several expressions, and from the several words, nay, from every jot. But what this parable involves 
in the internal sense will appear from what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4637</b></p><p><b>4637.</b>
It is quite clear that all the details, every single one, mentioned by the Lord in His parables are representative of and mean the spiritual and celestial attributes of His kingdom, and in the highest 
sense Divine attributes in Himself. Consequently anyone who does not know this cannot make anything else out of the Lord's parables than ordinary comparisons which hold nothing deeper within them, as 
with this particular parable concerning the ten virgins. He makes nothing more out of it if he does not know what 'virgins' means in the internal sense, and also what ten, five, lamps, vessels, oil, 
those who sell, a wedding feast, and every other detail mean. And the same is true with all other parables. As has been stated, the details mentioned by the Lord in them look, in the outward form they 
take, like ordinary comparisons, but in their internal form their nature is such that they fill the whole of heaven. This is because the internal sense is contained within every detail, and that sense 
is such that its spiritual and celestial content spreads like light and flame throughout the heavens in all directions. That sense is utterly superior to the sense of the letter, flowing from every 
phrase and every word, indeed from every tiny letter. But what is embodied in the internal sense of this particular parable may be seen from what follows below. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4637</b>
</p><b>4637.</b>
Quod omnia et singula quae Dominus locutus est in parabolis, repraesentativa et significativa sint spiritualium et caelestium regni Ipsius, et in supremo sensu Divinorum apud Ipsum, constat manifeste; 
quare qui non id novit, nihil aliud de parabolis Domini capere potest quam quod sint sicut similitudines vulgares et nihil plus in sinu recondant; prout haec de decem virginibus, nisi sciatur 
quid in sensu interno `virgines' significant, tum quid decem, quid quinque, quid lampades, quid vasa, quid oleum, quid vendentes, quid nuptiae, et reliqua; similiter in omnibus aliis parabolis; quae 
Dominus in illis locutus est, apparent in externa forma sicut, ut dictum, similitudines vulgares, sed in interna sunt tales ut impleant universum caelum, nam sensus internus singulis inest, qui 
talis est ut spirituale et caeleste ejus se diffundat per caelos undequaque sicut lux et flamma; is sensus est prorsus elevatus a sensu litterae, et fluit a singulis expressionibus et a singulis vocibus, 
immo ab omni iota.  Quid {1}autem haec parabola in sensu interno involvit, patet ab his quae sequuntur.      @1 itaque$ </p>
