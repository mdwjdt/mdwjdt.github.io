<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8243节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8243.</strong>当木星灵与我同在时，我觉得我们地球居民的脸看上去比平常要小。这是由于以下事实：我受来自这些灵人的一种观念影响，就是他们对自己的脸所持的观念，即：他们的脸更大。因为他们作为世人在自己星球生活时，就认为死后他们的脸会更大，并且呈圆形。这种观念已经被深深地印在他们身上，所以就与他们同在；等到他们成为灵人时，便觉得自己有一张更大的脸。他们之所以认为他们的脸会变大，是因为他们说，脸不是身体，因他们通过脸来说话并表达自己的思想，心智由此通过脸可以说变得可见。因此，他们对脸有一种观念，即脸是心智所取的形式；他们知道，在世生活结束后，他们会变得更智慧，所以他们认为他们心智所取的形式，也就是他们的脸会变大。</p>

When the spirits of Jupiter were with me, the faces of the inhabitants of our earth appeared smaller to me than usual, the source of which was that there inflowed from those spirits the idea which they 
had about their own faces-that they were larger. For while they live as men on their own earth, they believe that after their decease their faces will be larger, and round in form; and because this 
idea has been impressed on them, it consequently remains, and when they become spirits, they appear to themselves to have larger faces. The reason why they believe that their faces will be larger is 
that they say that the face is not the body, because by its means they speak and present their thoughts, and because the mind is thus as it were transparent through it; consequently they have an idea 
of the face as of the mind in form; and as they know that they will be wiser after their life in the world, they believe that the form of their mind, that is, their face, will become larger. </p>

When spirits belonging to Jupiter were present with me the faces of members of our planet seemed to me to be smaller than usual. This was due to the fact that I was influenced by an idea coming from 
those spirits which they had regarding their own faces, that they were larger. For when they are living as people on their planet they believe that their faces will be larger after death, and round- shaped. 
And because this idea is firmly impressed on them it therefore also endures with them; and when they become spirits they appear to themselves to have a larger face. The reason why they believe 
their faces will be larger is that they say the face is not the body, since they speak and present their thoughts by means of it, and the mind is thereby made visible through it so to speak. Therefore 
they have the idea that the face is the outward form taken by the mind; and since they know that they will be wiser after their life in the world, they consequently believe that the outward form their 
mind takes, that is, their face, will become fuller. </p>

</p><b>8243.</b>
Cum spiritus Joviales apud me erant, apparebant mihi facies incolarum nostrae telluris solito minores; quod inde venit, quia ex spiritibus illis influebat idea quam habebant de (t)suis faciebus, quod 
majores essent; credunt enim, cum vivunt homines in tellure sua, quod post obitum facies suae majores futurae sint, et quoad formam rotundae; et quia haec idea illis impressa est, inde quoque illa permanet, 
et cum fiunt spiritus, apparent sibi majore facie; quod credant facies suas majores futuras, est quia dicunt faciem non esse corpus, ex causa quia per illam loquuntur ac sistunt cogitata sua, 
et quia sic per illam {1}mens quasi transparet; inde de facie habent ideam sicut de mente in forma; et quia sciunt quod sapientiores futuri sint post vitam in mundo, inde mentis formam, seu faciem, ampliorem 
fieri credunt. 	@1 transparet mens$ </p>
