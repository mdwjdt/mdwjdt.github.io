Verses 21, 22. And the man, marveling at her, withheld himself, to know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not. And it came to pass when the camels had done drinking, that the man took a jewel 
of gold, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten of gold their weight. "And the man, marveling at her, withheld himself," signifies a state of perception as to those things; "to 
know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not," signifies concerning Divine truth, what it was; "and it came to pass when the camels had done drinking," signifies acknowledgment from enlightenment 
in general memory-knowledges; "that the man took a jewel of gold," signifies Divine good; "of half a shekel weight," signifies sufficient for initiation; "and two bracelets," signifies Divine truth; 
"for her hands," signifies the power of the affection of truth; "ten of gold their weight," signifies what is full for initiation. </p>

Verses 21, 22 And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not. And so it was, when the camels finished drinking, that the man took a gold nose-jewel, 
half a shekel in weight, and two bracelets to go on her hands, ten [shekels] of gold in weight. </p>
<p>'The man, wondering at her, remained silent' means a state of perception regarding those things. 
'So as to know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not' means regarding Divine Truth, as to what sort it was. 'And so it was, when the camels finished drinking' means acknowledgement resulting 
from enlightenment in general facts. 'That the man took a gold nose-jewel' means Divine Good. 'Half a shekel in weight' means the amount needed for the introduction. 'And two bracelets' means Divine 
Truth. 'To go on her hands' means the power of the affection for truth. 'Ten [shekels] of gold in weight' means the full amount involved in the introduction. </p>

Vers. 21, 22.  Et vir obstupescens illi continens se, ad sciendum an prosperavisset Jehovah viam suam, vel non.  Et fuit, quando absolverunt cameli bibere, et accepit vir monile auri, dimidium sicli 
pondus ejus, et duas armillas super manus ejus, decem auri pondus carum.  `Vir obstupescens illi continens se' significat statum perceptionis quoad illa: `ad sciendum an prosperavisset Jehovah viam suam, 
vel non' significat de Divino Vero, quodnam: `et fuit quando absolverunt cameli bibere' significat agnitionem ex illustratione in scientificis communibus: `et accepit vir monile auri' significat 
Divinum Bonum: `dimidium sicli pondus ejus' significat quantum ad initiationem: `et duas armillas' significat Divinum Verum: `super manus ejus' significat potentiam affectionis veri: `decem auri pondus 
earum' significat plenum ad initiationem. </p>
