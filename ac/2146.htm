<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2146.</strong>“那天正热”表由爱而生。这从“热”的含义清楚可知，“热”的内义是指爱。由于既有一天当中的热，也有一年当中的热，故根据历史叙述，爱要么由一天之热来代表，要么由一年之热来代表。“热”表示爱，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来，即：爱被称为属灵之热，甚至在日常用语中，温暖就表示一个人的全部情感。这一点还可从这一事实进一步清楚看出来，即：爱及其情感在人的内层，以及外层，甚至肉体部位表现为一种热。事实上，当热从人的内层流出时，它在人里面并没有其它来源。然而，爱如何，热就如何。属天之爱和属灵之爱才是那产生真热的。所有其它热，也就是来自自我之爱和物欲，以及其它污秽之爱的热，都是不洁的，在来世会转化为粪便（参看<a href="1773.htm">1773</a>节）。此外，要知道，神圣只用于爱和仁，从不用于信，除非爱和仁存在于信之真理中。除此之外，信之真理根本不神圣（参看前面所述<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>节）。</p>

As the day was growing hot. That this signifies from love, is evident from the signification of "heat," as being in the internal sense love; and since heat belongs either to the day or to the year, love 
is represented either by the heat of the day or by the heat of the year, according to what is related in the historicals. That "heat" signifies love may be seen from the fact that love is called spiritual 
heat, and that growing warm is predicated of all affection, even in common speech; and further from the fact that love and its affections, in man's interiors, as also in his exteriors, and even 
in his very corporeals, make themselves manifest under the guise of heat; in fact heat has no other origin in connection with man when it flows forth from his interiors. Such however as is the love, 
such is the heat. Celestial love and spiritual love are what give genuine heat. All other heat, namely, that which is from the loves of self and of the world, and also from other filthy loves, is unclean, 
and in the other life sinks into what is excrementitious (see n. 1773). Be it known moreover that holiness is never predicated except of love and charity; not of faith except insofar as love and 
charity are in the truths of faith. Except from this the truths of faith are not holy. (See what was said before, n. 2049.) </p>

'As the day was getting warmer' means generated by love. This is clear from the meaning in the internal sense of 'warmth' as love. And because the word warmth is used either of the day or of the year, 
love is represented either by the warm part of the day or by the warm part of the year, depending on what is mentioned in the historical narratives. That 'warmth' means love becomes clear from the fact 
that love is called spiritual warmth and by the fact that even in everyday speech a person's whole affection is meant by his increasing warmness. The same is further clear from the fact that love 
and its affections show themselves as a type of warmth in man's interiors, and also in his exteriors, and even in his actual bodily parts. Indeed that warmth has no other origin in a person when it is 
flowing out from his interiors. But as is the nature of the love, so is that of the warmth. Celestial love and spiritual love are what produce genuine warmth. Every other kind of warmth - namely that 
generated by self- love and love of the world, and so by other filthy loves - is unclean and turns in the next life into excrement, see <a href="1773.htm">1773</a>. Furthermore it should be realized that the expression holiness 
cannot be used except of love and charity and cannot be used of faith except insofar as love or charity are present within the truths of faith. But for that presence in them the truths of faith 
are not holy at all. See what has been stated already in <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>. </p>

</p><b>2146.</b>
`Incalescente die': quod significet ex amore, constat ex significatione `caloris' quod in sensu interno sit amor; et quia calor est vel diei vel anni, repraesentatur amor vel per calorem diei vel per 
calorem anni, secundum illa quae in historicis memorantur: qua `calor' significet amorem, ex eo constare potest quod amor dicatur calor spiritualis et quod omnis affectio significetur per incalescentiam, 
etiam in sermone vulgari; et praeterea ex eo quod amor et ejus affectiones, in interioribus hominis, tum quoque in exterioribus ejus inque ipsis corporeis, manifestum se sistant per speciem caloris; 
immo nec aliunde est origo ejus apud hominem, cum ex interioribus ejus effluit: sed qualis amor, talis calor; amor caelestis et amor spiritualis sunt {1} qui genuinum calorem sistunt; omnis alius 
calor, qui nempe ex amoribus sui et mundi, tam ex aliis amoribus spurcis, est immundus, et fatiscit in altera vita in excrementitium, videatur n. 1773. Praeterea sciendum quod sanctum nusquam praedicetur 
nisi ex amore et charitate, (non autem ex fide nisi quantum amoris aut charitatis fidei veris inest; fidei vera non sancta sunt nisi inde; videantur quae prius n. 2049. 	@1 est.$ </p>
