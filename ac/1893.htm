<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1893节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1893.</strong>“亚伯兰的妻子撒莱，没有给他生孩子”表理性人尚不存在。这从下文清楚可知，也就是论述以撒的地方。因为如前所述，每个人都有一个内在人，一个介于中间的理性人，和一个外在人，严格来说，这外在人就是属世人。对主而言，这三者由亚伯兰、以撒和雅各来代表：亚伯兰代表内在人，以撒代表理性人，而雅各则代表属世人。主里面的内在人就是耶和华自己，因为主由耶和华成孕。因此，祂才经常称呼耶和华为祂的“父”，并且在圣言中，祂被称为“神的独生子”、“神唯一的儿子”。人生来并没有理性人，只有变得理性的潜能。谁都能从以下事实清楚明白这一点：新生儿没有任何理智，但随着时间推移，会通过外在和内在的感官事物而变得理性，因为他们充满知识和认知。诚然，儿童看似理性，事实上并不理性，只不过是一种理性的萌芽。这一点从以下事实可知：理智属于成人和上了年纪的人。<br />本章论述的主题是主的理性人。神圣理性（Divine Rational）本身由以撒来代表，而变成神性之前的第一理性由以实玛利来代表。故此处经文“亚伯兰的妻子撒莱，没有给他生孩子”表神圣理性尚不存在。前面已说明，主和其他人一样出生，并且就其从母亲玛利亚那里所得之物而言，祂和其他人没什么两样。由于理性通过知识和认知形成，而知识和认知则经由外在感官的途径，或属外在人的感觉进入，故祂的第一理性生来和其他人一样。不过，由于祂凭自己的力量便自己里面人性的一切变成神性，所以祂也会使理性变成神性。祂的第一理性在本章有所描述，在21章则有更多描述，其中21章的9-21节再次论述了夏甲和以实玛利，那里的经文说，当代表神圣理性的以撒长大后，以实玛利就被赶走了。</p>

Sarai, Abram's wife, did not bear unto him. That this signifies that the rational man was not yet, will be evident from what follows, where Isaac is treated of. For, as has been said, there are in every 
man an internal man, a rational man that is intermediate, and an external, which is properly called the natural man. With the Lord these were represented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the internal 
man by Abraham, the rational by Isaac, and the natural by Jacob. The internal man in the Lord was Jehovah Himself, for He was conceived of Jehovah; on this account He so often called Him His "Father," 
and in the Word He is called the "Only-begotten of God," and the only "Son of God." The rational man is not born with man, but only the capacity for becoming rational, as all may see from the fact that 
new-born infants are not endowed with any reason, but become rational in process of time by means of things of sense external and internal, as they are imbued with knowledges [scientiae et cognitiones]. 
In children indeed there is an appearance of rationality, yet it is not rationality, but is only a kind of rudiment of it, which is known from the fact that reason belongs to adults and men of 
years.  [2] The rational man in the Lord is treated of in this chapter. The Divine Rational itself is represented by Isaac; but the first rational before it was made Divine, by Ishmael; and therefore 
that "Sarai, Abram's wife, did not bear unto him" here signifies that hitherto there was no Divine rational. As before said, the Lord was born as are other men, and as regards all that He drew from Mary 
the mother He was like other men; and as the rational is formed by means of knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones], which enter through things of the external senses, or those of the external man, 
therefore His first rational was born as with any other man; but as by His own power He made Divine all the human things that appertained to Him, so did He also make the rational Divine. His first rational 
is described in this chapter, and also in chapter 21, where Hagar and Ishmael are likewise treated of (from verses 9 to 21), and it is said that Ishmael was expelled when Isaac grew up, by whom 
is represented the Divine rational.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1893</b></p><p><b>1893.</b>
That 'Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no child' means that the Rational Man did not as yet exist will be clear from what is said later on, when Isaac is the subject, for everyone, as has been stated, has 
an internal man, a rational man which is in between, and an external man, which strictly speaking is the natural man. These, as they existed with the Lord, were represented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 
- the Internal Man by Abraham, the Rational Man by Isaac, and the Natural Man by Jacob. The Lord's Internal Man was Jehovah Himself, for He was conceived from Jehovah. This was why so many times 
He referred to Jehovah as His Father, and why in the Word the Lord is called 'the only begotten of God' and 'God's only Son'. The rational man does not exist with anyone when he is first born, only a 
potentiality to become rational, as may become clear to anyone from the fact that new-born babes do not possess reason but become rational as time goes by through the response of the senses to stimuli 
from without and from within, as knowledge and cognitions are bestowed on them. Rationality does, it is true, appear to exist with children; but rationality does not in fact do so, only something of 
the first beginnings of it, as may be recognized from the fact that reason resides with people who are adult and advanced in years. </p>

 The Lord's Rational Man is the subject in the present chapter. 
The Divine Rational itself is represented by Isaac, but the first rational before it had become Divine is represented by Ishmael. Here therefore the statement that 'Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no 
child' means that the Divine Rational did not as yet exist. As stated already, the Lord was born in the same way as any other, and as regards what He derived from Mary His mother He was like any other. 
And because the rational is formed through facts and cognitions which enter in by way of the external senses, or the senses that belong to the external man, His first rational was therefore born as 
it is with any other. But since everything human in Him was made Divine by His own power, so was the rational made Divine. His first rational is described in the present chapter, and once more in Chapter <a href="21.htm">21</a>, where again in verses 9-21 Hagar and Ishmael are the subject, where it is said that Ishmael was cast out when Isaac, who represents the Divine Rational, had grown up. </p>

Quod `Sarai uxor Abrami non peperit illi' significet quod nondum Rationalis Homo, constabit a sequentibus ubi de Isaco: sunt enim, ut dictum, apud unumquemvis hominem internus homo, rationalis homo 
qui medius, et externus qui proprie naturalis homo dicitur; hi repraesentati sunt apud Dominum per Abrahamum, Isacum et Jacobum, Internus Homo per Abrahamum, Rationalis per Isacum, et Naturalis per Jacobum: 
Internus Homo apud Dominum fuit Ipse Jehovah, nam conceptus est a Jehovah, quare Ipsum Patrem Suum toties nominavit, et in Verbo dictus Unigenitus Dei et solus Filius Dei.  Rationalis homo non 
connascitur, sed solum facultas ut homo fieri possit rationalis, ut cuique constare potest ex eo quod infantes recens nati nulla ratione sint praediti, sed quod rationales fiant successu temporis mediis 
sensualibus externis et internis, sicut imbuuntur scientiis et cognitionibus: apud pueros quidem apparet `rationale sed usque non est rationale, solum quoddam ejus initiamentum, quod noscitur ex eo 
quod ratio sit apud adultos et senes.  [2] De Rationali Homine apud Dominum in hoc capite agitur; ipsum Rationale Divinum repraesentatur per Isacum, sed rationale primum antequam factum est Divinum, 
per Ismaelem, quare hic per quod `Sarai uxor Abrami non peperit ei' significatur quod adhuc Dominum Rationale Divinum: Dominus, sicut {2} prius dictum natus fuit sicut alius homo, et quoad illa quae traxit 
a quia matre fuit sicut alius homo, et quia rationale formatur per scientifica et cognitiones quae per sensualia externa seu externi hominis intrant, inde rationale Ipsius primum natum est sicut 
apud alium hominem, sed quia omnia quae humana erant (o)apud Se', propria potentia faceret Divina, ita quoque rationale: rationale Ipsius primum describitur in hoc capite, tum quoque in cap. xxi ubi 
etiam de Hagare et Ismaele a vers. (x)9 ad 21 agitur, quod nempe (o)hic expulsus sit cum adolevit Isacus per quem repraesentatur Rationale Divinum. 	@1 i sicut. $ 	@2 ut aliquoties.$ </p>
