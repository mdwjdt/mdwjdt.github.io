<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7127节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7127.</strong>“我决不给你们稻草”表最笼统的记忆知识不再从这个源头获得。这从“决不给”和“稻草”的含义清楚可知：“决不给”是指不再提供；“稻草”是指最笼统的记忆知识（参看<a href="7112.htm">7112</a>节）。前面已阐明此中情形。但除此之外，还应提及的是，在来世，那些曾属于教会，并确信唯信得救，然而却没有过信仰的生活，而是过着邪恶生活的人尤其会把稻草（也就是最笼统的记忆知识）掷于他们所侵扰的人面前。这些人在来世的秉性和在世时一样；他们熟知用来支持唯信的证据，声称唯独信就能拯救人，无论他过着怎样的生活。<br />但这些证据无非是与最初的命题相一致的推理；因为任何东西，甚至最虚假的东西都能通过推理来证实，还能通过巧妙的说辞和结论作为真理被呈现给简单人。为达到这个目的，这些人主要利用圣言中最笼统的说法；若没有圣言的内义，这些说法就能被扭曲，以支持任何观点。这类说法就是他们掷于那些属于属灵教会的人面前的东西；他们利用这些东西侵扰这些人。但是，这些说法只不过是用来作砖的稻草或麦桔，因为他们将最本质的东西，也就是仁爱排除在外。诚然，他们会说仁爱的行为是信仰的果实，但仍视这些行为一文不值，并说服其他人相信，无论一个人过着怎样的生活，即便在生命最后一刻，他也能唯独靠着信得救，因而靠着没有果实，由此没有信与仁之生活的信仰而得救。<br />在来世，只要这类观念被掷于正直人面前，这些人就会拿起争战的论据，并能保卫自己；因为当基本的美德，即仁爱被如此排除在外时，以及当他们发现这种人不关注一个人所过的生活时，他们就明白，推理是靠不住的。他们从来世的每一个方面都如同在晴天白日之下那样看见这些事。这些就是“稻草”所表示的最低级或最基本和最笼统的记忆知识所指的事。那些确信唯信得救，然而过着邪恶生活的人在右边稍向前一点一个相当深的地狱中；我从那里听他们说，他们用推理来侵扰正直人。不过，正直人因被主通过天使引导，故会弃绝这些毫无价值的空洞推理；他们还发现，谬误就包含在基于圣言的笼统真理的证明和论据中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7127</b></p><p><b>7127.</b>
I will by no means give you straw. That this signifies no longer thence the most general memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "by no means giving," as being no longer to furnish; and 
from the signification of "straw," as being the most general memory-knowledges of all (see n. 7112). How the case herein is has already been told. But it must be told further, that in the other life 
those who have been of the church, and have persuaded themselves that faith alone saves, yet have not lived the life of faith, but a life of evil, especially put straw (that is, the most general memory-knowledges 
of all) before the upright whom they are infesting. These men are of the same character there as they had been in the world; they are acquainted with confirming arguments in favor of faith 
alone, by which they say that man is saved no matter how he had lived; but these confirming arguments are nothing but reasonings that agree with the given proposition; for everything, even what is 
most false, can be confirmed by reasonings, and can also be presented to the simple as true, by means of the arts of eloquence and of inference. [2] For this purpose they especially employ such things 
from the Word as are the most general of all, and which without the internal sense of the word can be drawn to favor any opinion whatever. Such are the things which they put before those who are of 
the spiritual church; and by means of which they infest them; although they are nothing but chaff or straw for making bricks, for they exclude the most essential thing of all, namely, charity.  They 
indeed say that works of charity are the fruits of faith, but still they make these works of no account, and persuade their hearers that man is saved by faith alone no matter what his life has been, 
even in life's last moments; thus by faith without its fruits, consequently without the life of faith and charity. [3] So long as such things are put before the upright in the other life, these wield 
fighting arguments, and are able to defend themselves, for they see that reasonings are fallacious when the essential, which is charity, is thus excluded, and also when they see that no regard is paid 
to the life. From everything in the other life, both in general and in particular, they see these things as in clear day. Such then is what is meant by the memory-knowledges the lowest and most general 
of all, which are signified by "straw." They who have persuaded themselves that faith alone saves, and yet have lived a life of evil, are in hell at a considerable depth toward the right, a little 
in front; and I have heard them from thence infesting the upright with reasonings; but these, being led of the Lord by the angels, rejected the reasonings as being empty, and they also exposed the fallacies 
which were in the confirmations and arguments from the general things of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7127</b></p><p><b>7127.</b>
'By no means do I give you straw' means that the most general factual knowledge was no longer made available from that source. This is clear from the meaning of 'by no means giving' as no longer supplying; 
and from the meaning of 'straw' as the most general factual knowledge of all, dealt with in <a href="7112.htm">7112</a>. What these words imply has been stated [in that paragraph] above. But in addition to this it should 
be mentioned that in the next life the ones who toss straw - that is, the most general factual knowledge of all - in the way of the upright whom they molest are primarily people who have belonged 
to the Church. They are people who convinced themselves that faith alone saved, yet did not lead a life of faith but a life of evil. In the next life these people are the same as they were in the world; 
they know the arguments that are used to substantiate faith alone, which they say saves a person irrespective of the life he has been leading. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But those substantiations are nothing else than 
reasonings that agree with the initial proposition; for anything at all, even that which is extremely false, can be substantiated by means of reasonings, and can also be presented to simple persons 
as the truth by the use of clever speaking and drawing of conclusions. For this purpose those people use chiefly the most general statements of all in the Word, which without the internal sense of the 
Word can be twisted to support any opinion at all. These kinds of statements are what they toss in the way of those who belong to the spiritual Church; they use such to molest them. But these statements 
are still no more than 'straw for making bricks'. For those people exclude the absolutely essential virtue, namely charity. They do, it is true, say that the works of charity are the fruits of faith; 
but they still consider them to be worthless and convince others that regardless of what kind of life a person has led he is saved by faith alone, even during the last hour of his life, and so is 
saved by faith without its fruits, thus without a life of faith and charity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So long as such ideas are tossed in their way the upright in the next life possess arguments to fight with and can 
defend themselves; for they see that reasonings are unsound when the essential virtue, which is charity, is so excluded, and also when they see that such people set no store by the life a person leads. 
These are the considerations that every single facet of the next life enables them to see, as in broad daylight. These then are the things that are to be understood by the basest kind of factual knowledge, 
the most general of all, meant by 'straw'. People who have convinced themselves that faith alone saves and yet have led a life of evil are in hell, quite deep down and slightly in front over to 
the right, from where - as I have heard them - they molest the upright with their reasonings. But being led by the Lord by means of angels, the upright have rejected those reasonings as worthless, and 
they have also detected the fallacies contained in proofs and arguments based on general truths in the Word. </p>

`Nequaquam do vobis paleam':  quod significet quod non amplius inde scientifica {1}communissima, constat ex significatione `nequaquam dare' quod sit non amplius subministrare; et ex significatione `paleae' 
quod sint scientifica omnium communissima, de qua n. 7112.  Quomodo haec se habent, supra dictum est, ulterius autem dicendum quod illi imprimis in altera vita objiciant paleam, hoc est, scientifica 
omnium communissima, probis quos infestant, qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt, et sibi persuaserunt solam fidem {2}salvare, sed usque non vixerunt vitam fidei, sed vitam mali; illi tales sunt {3}ibi, quales 
fuerunt in mundo, {4} confirmantia {5}sciunt pro sola fide, per 2 quam dicunt salvari hominem, utcumque vixerat; sed confirmantia illa non (t)aliud sunt quam ratiocinia cum propositione data concurrentia; 
nam quodlibet, etiam maxime falsum, per ratiocinia confirmari potest, et quoque per artes eloquendi et concludendi sisti simplicibus sicut verum; ad hoc adhibent imprimis talia quae sunt omnium 
communissima ex Verbo, quae absque sensu interno Verbi ad favorem cujuscumque opinionis trahi queunt; talia sunt quae objiciunt, et per quae infestant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; sed usque non 
aliud sunt quam palea seu stramen ad faciendum lateres; nam ipsissimum essentiale excludunt, nempe charitatem; dicunt quidem quod charitatis opera sint fructus fidei, sed usque illa nihili faciunt, 
{6}et persuadent quod salvetur homo per solam fidem, qualiscumque vita fuerit, etiam in ultima vitae hora, ita {8} per fidem 3 absque suis fructibus, {9}sic absque vita fidei et charitatis; quamdiu talia 
objiciuntur probis in altera vita, argumenta pugnae habent, et se defendere possunt, nam vident quod ratiocinia fallacia sint, cum essentiale, quod est charitas, ita excluditur, et quoque cum vident 
quod vitam non curent{10}; haec vident (x)ab omnibus et singulis in altera vita ut in clara die; talia nunc sunt quae intelliguntur per scientifica infima et omnium communissima, et significantur per 
`paleam'.  Qui {11}sibi persuaserunt quod sola fides salvet, et tamen vixerunt vitam mali, sunt in inferno satis profunde versus {12}dextrum paulo antrorsum; et inde audivi illos ratiociniis infestare 
probos; sed probi a Domino per angelos ducti, illa ut vana rejecerunt, et quoque {13}detexerunt fallacias quae inessent confirmantibus et argumentis ex communibus Verbi {14}. 	@1 communia AI$ 	@2
