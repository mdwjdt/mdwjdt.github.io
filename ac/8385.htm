<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8385.</strong>他们在我的思维中发现一种渴望，即我想在我们地球上公布这些事。他们不希望我这样做，因为他们被禁止透露他们的灵人对他们所说的话。他们感到惊奇的是，这些事仅仅通过文字就能公之于众；这时，我告诉他们我们地球上的印刷术，以及圣言，还告诉他们教会所制定的教义。我说，圣言和这些教义以出版的形式发出，并以这种方式被人学习。</p>

They observed in my thoughts a desire to publish these things in our earth. This they did not wish, because they are forbidden to publish what is said to them by their spirits. They wondered that such 
things could be published merely by means of writings; but they were then informed about printing, and also about the Word, and likewise about the teachings of the church in our earth; and they were 
told that the Word and the teachings so stand forth in a published form, and in this way are learned. </p>

They saw that I thought I would like to make known on our planet such matters; but they did not wish me to do so because they are forbidden to divulge what their spirits tell them. They were amazed that 
such matters could be made known simply by means of written words, at which point I told them about printing on our planet, as well as about the Word and also about teachings formulated by the Church. 
I said that the Word and such teachings, available as a result of having appeared in print, are learned by that means. </p>

Observarunt quod cogitarem quod talia vulgare vellem in nostra tellure; hoc non volebant, quia illis vetitum est vulgare quod illis a spiritibus illorum dicitur; mirabantur quod talia vulgari possent 
solum per scripta; {1}at' tunc informabantur de typis, tum de Verbo, et quoque de doctrinalibus Ecclesiae in nostra tellure; et dictum quod Verbum ac doctrinalia ita exstent vulgata et sic discantur. 	@1 et$ </p>
