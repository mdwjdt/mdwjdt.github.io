<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10639</strong>.出埃及记34:12-17.你要谨慎，恐怕你与你所去那地的居民立约，又恐怕那会成为你中间的网罗；所以你要推倒他们的祭坛，打碎他们的柱子，砍掉他们的小树林。不可向别神下拜，因为耶和华名为忌妒者，祂是忌妒的神。恐怕你与那地的居民立约，百姓随从他们的神，就行淫，祭祀他们的神，有人叫你，你便吃他们的祭物，又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿，他们的女儿随从他们的神，就行淫，使你的儿子也随从她们的神行淫。不可为自己铸造神像。<br />“你要谨慎，恐怕你与你所去那地的居民立约”表不可依附于含有邪恶在里面的任何宗教。“又恐怕那会成为你中间的网罗”表因此在圣言本身上被误导。“所以你要推倒他们的祭坛”表必须弃绝包含在这种宗教和源于它的敬拜里面的邪恶。“打碎他们的柱子”表必须驱散邪恶的虚假。“砍掉他们的小树林”表必须彻底弃绝他们的教义。“不可向别神下拜”表要出于信和爱唯独敬拜主。“因为耶和华名为忌妒者，祂是忌妒的神”表若拜别人，神性良善和神性真理就会离开。“恐怕你与那地的居民立约”表以这种方式与含有邪恶在里面的任何其它宗教结合。“百姓随从他们的神，就行淫”表邪恶的虚假由此产生。“祭祀他们的神”表因而源于虚假的敬拜。“有人叫你，你便吃他们的祭物”表被邪恶所产生的虚假诱惑，并接受它，把它变成自己的。“又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿”表对邪恶的情感与真理的结合。“他们的女儿随从他们的神，就行淫，使你的儿子也随从她们的神行淫”表以这种方式亵渎良善和真理。“不可为自己铸造神像”表对自我，而不是对主的敬拜。</p>

Verses 12-17. Take heed to thyself, lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou comest, lest perchance it become a snare in the midst of thee. Wherefore ye shall 
overturn their altars, and shall break their pillars, and shall cut down their groves. Wherefore thou shalt not bow thyself to another god; for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, a jealous God is He. 
Lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land, and they commit whoredom after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice. And thou 
take of his daughters for thy sons, and his daughters commit whoredom after their gods, and make thy sons commit whoredom after their gods. Thou shalt not make for thee molten gods. "Take heed to thyself, 
lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou comest," signifies that there must be no adherence to any religious persuasion whatever that has evil in it; "lest 
perchance it become a snare in the midst of thee," signifies a consequent misleading in the Word itself; "wherefore ye shall overturn their altars," signifies that the evil of such a religious persuasion 
and of the consequent worship must be rejected; "and shall break their pillars," signifies that the falsities of evil must be dispersed; "and shall cut down their groves," signifies that their 
teachings must be utterly rejected; "wherefore thou shalt not bow thyself to another god," signifies that the Lord alone is to be worshiped from faith and love; "for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, a 
jealous God is He," signifies that if another is worshiped, Divine good and Divine truth will depart; "lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land," signifies in this manner a 
conjunction with the evil of any religious persuasion; "and they commit whoredom after their gods," signifies the consequent falsities of evil; "and sacrifice to their gods" signifies thus worship from 
falsities; "and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice," signifies the allurement, reception, and appropriation of falsity from evil; "and thou take of his daughters for thy sons," signifies the 
conjunction of the affections of evil with truths; "and his daughters commit whoredom after their gods, and make thy sons commit whoredom after their gods," signifies in this manner the profanation 
of good and of truth; "thou shalt not make for thee molten gods," signifies the worship of self and not of the Lord. </p>

Verses 12-17  Take care, lest by chance you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land onto which you come, lest by chance it become a snare in your midst. Therefore you shall overthrow their altars, 
and break their pillars, and tear down their groves. Therefore you shall not bow down to any other god, for Jehovah the Jealous One is His name, God the Jealous One is He. Lest by chance you make 
a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go whoring after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and they call you and you eat of their sacrifice, and you take their daughters for your 
sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods, and they cause your sons to go whoring after their gods. You shall not make gods of cast metal for yourself. </p>
<p>'Take care, lest by chance you 
make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land onto which you come' means that there is to be no attachment to any sort of religion involving evil. 'Lest by chance it become a snare in your midst' means 
consequently being led astray in the Word itself. 'Therefore you shall overthrow their altars' means that the evil involved in that type of religion and in the worship springing from it is to be 
rejected. 'And break their pillars' means that falsities of evil are to be done away with. 'And tear down their groves' means that their teachings are to be totally rejected. 'Therefore you shall not 
bow down to any other god' means that the Lord alone is to be worshipped in faith and love. 'For Jehovah the Jealous One is His name, God the Jealous One is He' means that if any other is worshipped Divine 
Good and Divine Truth depart. 'Lest by chance you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land' means being linked thereby to any other sort of religion that has evil in it. 'And they go whoring 
after their gods' means from which falsities of evil arise. 'And sacrifice to their gods' means thus worship springing from the falsities. 'And they call you and you eat of their sacrifice' means 
being enticed by and accepting falsity arising from evil, and making it one's own. 'And you take their daughters for your sons' means affections for evil linked to truths. 'And their daughters go whoring 
after their gods, and they cause your sons to go whoring after their gods' means profanation thereby of goodness and truth. 'You shall not make gods of cast metal for yourself' means worship of self 
and not of the Lord.  </p>

Vers. 12-17.  Cave tibi ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae super quam tu venis, ne forte fiat in laqueum in medio tui. Quare altaria eorum evertetis, et statuas eorum frangetis, et lucos ejus 
exscindetis.  Quare non incurvabis te deo alteri, nam Jehovah Zelotes nomen Ipsius, Deus Zelotes Ille.  Ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae, et scortentur post deos eorum, et sacrificent diis eorum, 
et vocet te, et comedas de sacrificio ejus.  Et accipias de filiabus ejus filiis tuis, et scortentur filiae ejus post deos earum, et scortari faciant filios tuos post deos earum. Deos fusilis non 
facies tibi.  `Cave tibi ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae super quam tu venis' significat quod non adhaerendum religioso cuicumque in quo malum:  `ne forte fiat in laqueum in medio tui' significat 
seductionem inde in ipso Verbo: `quare altaria eorum evertetis' significat quod malum religiosi istius et inde cultus rejiciendum:  `et statuas eorum frangetis' significat quod falsa mali dissipanda: 
 `et lucos ejus exscindetis' significat quod doctrinalia eorum prorsus rejicienda:  `quare non incurvabis te deo alteri' significat quod solus Dominus colendus ex fide et amore:  `nam Jehovah Zelotes 
nomen Ipsius, Deus Zelotes Ille' significat si alius colitur quod recedat Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum:  `ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae' significat sic conjunctionem cum malo cujusvis 
religiosi:  `et scortentur post deos eorum' significat inde falsa mali:  `et sacrificent diis eorum' significat sic cultum ex falsis:  `et vocet te, et comedas {1}de sacrificio ejus' significat allectationem, 
receptionem, et appropriationem falsi ex malo:  `et accipias de filiabus ejus filiis tuis' significat conjunctionem affectionum mali cum veris:  `et scortentur filiae ejus post deos earum, 
et scortari faciant filios tuos post deos earum' significat sic profanationem boni et veri:  `deos fusilis non facies tibi' significat cultum sui et non Domini. @1 ex IT$ </p>
