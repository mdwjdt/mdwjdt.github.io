<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2187节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2187.</strong>“他们就吃了”表以这种方式交流。这从“吃”的含义清楚可知，“吃”是指交流和结合，这也可从圣言明显看出来。亚伦和他的子孙利未人，以及百姓要在圣处吃祭祀的圣物，这一要求无非表示交流、结合和归给，如前面解读利未记的经文（6:9，10）所说的那样（参看<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节）。他们所吃的圣物就表示属天和属灵的食物，因此，吃那些圣物表示将那食物归为己有。这些圣物是未被焚在坛上的祭物的一部分，要么被祭司，要么被献祭的百姓吃了。这从论述祭物的很多经文明显可知（祭司当吃什么，出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.32.htm">29:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.33.htm">33</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.9.htm">6:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.6.htm">7:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.31.htm">8:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.12.htm">10:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.13.htm">13</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.9.htm">18:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.11.htm">11</a>；百姓当吃什么，利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.5.htm">19:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.6.htm">6</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.27.htm">12:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.7.htm">27:7</a>等；他们不能吃不洁之物，利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.19.htm">7:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.4.htm">22:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.7.htm">7</a>）。这些仪式的筵席在祭坛附近的圣地举行，要么在帐幕，要么在帐幕的院子里。它们无非表示属天良善的交流、结合和归给。因为它们代表属天的食物（关于这属天的食物，可参看<a href="56.htm">56</a>-<a href="58.htm">58</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>-<a href="681.htm">681</a>，<a href="1480.htm">1480</a>，<a href="1695.htm">1695</a>节），它们全都叫“饼”（关于饼的含义，可参看<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>节）。亚伦及其子孙在圣处吃陈设饼代表类似事物（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.9.htm">24:9</a>）。<br />给拿细耳人制定的条例是：在离俗的日子，凡葡萄树上所结的（由此所酿的酒），自核至皮所作的物，他都不可吃（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.4.htm">6:4</a>）。这是因为拿细耳人代表属天之人，而属天之人具有这样的性质，他甚至不愿提及属灵之物（这可见于第一卷<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="880.htm">880</a>末尾，<a href="1647.htm">1647</a>节）；由于酒、葡萄，以及凡葡萄树上所结之物，均表示属灵之物，故拿细耳人被禁止吃它们，也就是说，被禁止与它们交流、结合，并将其归给自己。<br />在以赛亚书中，“吃”表类似事物：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的也可以来买了吃，不用花钱，不付代价，也来买酒和奶。你们为何花钱买那不足为食物的？用劳碌得来的买那不使人饱足的呢？你们要留意听我的话，就能吃那美物，得享肥甘，心中喜乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.2.htm">2</a>）<br />以及约翰所说的话：<br />得胜的，我必将神乐园中生命树的果子赐给他吃。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.7.htm">2:7</a>）<br />“生命树”是属天之物本身，在至高义上是指主自己，因为一切属天之物，即一切爱与仁皆来自祂。因此，“吃生命树的果子”和吃主一样，而吃主就是被赐予爱与仁，因而被赐予那些属于天堂生命之物。正如主自己在约翰福音中所说的：<br />我是从天上降下来生命的粮，人若吃这粮，就必永远活着；那吃我的人，也要因我活着。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.51.htm">6:51</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.57.htm">57</a>）<br />但他们说，这话甚难。耶稣说：<br />我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.60.htm">6:60</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.63.htm">63</a>）<br />由此明显可知圣餐中的吃表示什么（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.26.htm">26:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.28.htm">28</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.22.htm">14:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.23.htm">23</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.19.htm">22:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.20.htm">20</a>）；也就是说，“吃”表交流、结合并归给自己。由此也清楚可知主说的这些话是什么意思：<br />从东从西，将有许多人来，与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.11.htm">8:11</a>）<br />这不是指这些人要与他们在神国里同吃喝，而是说他们将享受“亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各”所表示的属天良善，即爱的属天之物。也就是说，他们要享受爱的至内在的属天良善，就是“亚伯拉罕”所表示的，也要享受较为低级的中间那类良善，如那些属于理性之物，就是“以撒”所表示的，还要享受更为低级的属天-属世的那类良善，就是“雅各”所表示的诸如出现在第一层天堂的那类良善。这些就是构成这些话的内义的事物。这类事物由亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各来表示（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>节，以及凡论述他们的其它地方）。无论我们说享受这些属天之物，还是说享受这些人所代表的主，意思都一样。因为主是所有这些事物的源头，是它们全部中的全部。</p>

And they did eat. That this signifies communication in this manner, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being to be communicated and to be conjoined; as is also evident from the Word. The 
fact that Aaron, his sons, the Levites, and also the people, ate the hallowed things of the sacrifices in the holy place, signified nothing else than communication, conjunction, and appropriation, 
as above said at the explication of the passage from Leviticus 6:9, 10 (see n. 2177), for it was celestial and spiritual food that was signified by the hallowed things which they ate, consequently the 
appropriation of it. The hallowed things were the parts of the sacrifices which were not burned upon the altar, and were eaten either by the priests, or by the people that made the offering; as is evident 
from many passages where the sacrifices are treated of (what should be eaten by the priests, Exod. 29:32, 33; Lev. 6:9, 16, 18; 26; 7:6, 15-16, 18; 8:31; 10:12-13; Num. 18:9-11; what should be eaten 
by the people, Lev. 19:5-6; Deut. 12:27; 27:7; and elsewhere; and that the unclean should not eat of them, Lev. 7:19-21; 22:4-7). These feastings were made in a holy place near the altar, either 
at the door, or in the court of the tabernacle, and they signified nothing else than the communication, conjunction, and appropriation of celestial goods; for by them were represented celestial foods 
(concerning which food see n. 56-58, 680-681, 1480, 1695), and they were all called "bread," the signification of which may be seen above (n. 2165). The like was represented by Aaron and his sons eating 
the showbread or "bread of faces," in a holy place (Lev. 24:9). [2] The law given for the Nazirite-that in the days of his Naziriteship he should not eat of anything from the grape, whence wine is 
made, from the seeds even to the skin (Num. 6:4)-was because the Nazirite represented the celestial man, and the celestial man is such that he is not willing even to mention spiritual things (as may 
be seen in volume 1, n. 202, 337, 880 at the end, 1647); and as wine and the grape, and also whatever is from the grape, signified what is spiritual, it was therefore forbidden the Nazirite to eat of 
them; that is, to have communication with them, to conjoin himself with them, and to appropriate them to himself. [3] The like is meant by "eating" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Everyone that thirsteth, come ye to 
the waters, and he that hath no silver, come ye, buy, and eat; yea come, buy wine and milk without silver and without price. Wherefore do ye weigh silver for that which is not bread? and your labor 
for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good, and your soul shall be deliciated in fatness (Isa. 55:1-2). As also in John: </p>
<p>     To him that overcometh I will 
give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God (Rev. 2:7). The "tree of life" is the celestial itself, and in the supreme sense is the Lord Himself, because from Him 
is all the celestial, that is, all love and charity. Thus to "eat of the tree of life" is the same as to eat the Lord, and to eat the Lord is to be gifted with love and charity, and thus with those 
things which are of heavenly life. This the Lord Himself says in John: </p>
<p>     I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eat of this bread, he shall live to eternity; he that eateth Me 
shall live by Me (John 6:51, 57). But they said, This is a hard saying. And Jesus said, The words that I speak unto you are spirit, and are life (John 6:60, 63). [4] Hence it is manifest what is meant 
by eating in the Holy Supper (Matt. 26:26-28; Mark 14:22, 23; Luke 22:19, 20); namely, to have communication, to be conjoined, and to appropriate to oneself. Hence also it is clear what is meant by 
the Lord's saying that: </p>
<p>     Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Matt. 8:11), not that they are to eat with them in the kingdom of God, but 
that they will enjoy the celestial goods which are signified by "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," namely, the celestial things of love; not only the inmost, which are "Abraham," but also the lower that are 
intermediate, as are those of the rational, which are "Isaac;" and the still lower, which are the celestial natural, such as are in the first heaven, and which are meant by "Jacob." Such is the internal 
sense of these words. (That these things are meant by "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," may be seen in n. 1893, and wherever else they are treated of.) For whether we speak of enjoying those celestial 
things, or of enjoying the Lord, who is represented by those men, it is the same thing; for all those things are from the Lord, and the Lord is the all in all of them. </p>

'And they ate' means communication in this manner. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'eating' as being communicated, and also being joined together, as is also evident from the Word. The injunction 
that Aaron, and his sons the Levites, and also the people were to eat the consecrated elements of the sacrifices in a holy place meant nothing other than the communication, conjunction, and making 
one's own, as stated above in <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, at the point where <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6: 16, 17</a>, is referred to. For it was celestial and spiritual food that was meant by the consecrated elements, and thus making that food their 
own by eating those elements. These consecrated elements were those parts of the sacrifices which were not burned on the altar but were eaten either by the priests or by the people who brought the 
offering, as becomes clear from very many places where the sacrifices are the subject. The consecrated elements that were to be eaten by the priests are referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:%2032,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29: 32, 33</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:%2016,%2026;%207:%206,%2015,%2016,%2018;%208:%2031;%2010:%2012,%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6: 16, 26; 7: 6, 15, 16, 18; 8: 31; 10: 12, </a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2018:%209-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 18: 9-11</a>; and those to be eaten by the people, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2019:%205%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 19: 5 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2012:%2027;%2027:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 12: 27; 27: 7</a>; and elsewhere. And that those who were unclean were not to eat of them is 
referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%207:%2019-21;%2022:%204-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 7: 19-21; 22: 4-7</a>. These ritual feasts took place in a holy place near the altar, either at the gate or in the court outside the tent. And they meant nothing else than the communication, 
conjunction, and making of celestial goods one's own, for those feasts represented celestial food. For what celestial food is, see <a href="56.htm">56</a>-<a href="58.htm">58</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="681.htm">681</a>, <a href="1480.htm">1480</a>, <a href="1695.htm">1695</a>. And all those consecrated elements 
were called 'bread', for the meaning of which see above in <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>. Something similar was represented by Aaron and his sons eating the loaves of the presence, or the shewbread, in a holy place, Lev. 
24: <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason for the law given to the Nazirite that during the days of his Naziriteship he was forbidden to eat anything that is produced from the grape - from which wine is made - from pips 
even to skin, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6: 4</a>, is that the Nazirite represented the celestial man, and the celestial man is such as is not willing even to mention spiritual things, see Volume One, in <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="880.htm">880</a> (end), 
<a href="1647.htm">1647</a>. And because 'wine' and 'the grape', and also whatever came from the grape, meant that which is spiritual, the Nazirite was therefore forbidden to eat of them, that is, to have any communication 
with spiritual things, to join himself to them, or to make them his own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Something similar is meant by 'eating' in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money, 
come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Why do you spend money on that which is not bread, and your labour on that which does not satisfy? Hearken diligently to 
Me and eat what is good, and your soul will delight itself in fatness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55: 1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And also what is said in John, </p>
<blockquote>
To him who conquers I will grant to eat from the tree of life which is in the 
middle of the Paradise of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%202:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 2: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The tree of life' is the celestial itself, and in the highest sense it is the Lord Himself since He is the source of everything celestial, that is, of all 
love and charity. Thus 'eating from the tree of life' is the same as feeding on the Lord; and 'feeding on the Lord' is being endowed with love and charity, thus with those things that belong to heavenly 
life, as the Lord Himself declares in John, </p>
<p>I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live for ever. He who feeds on Me will live through Me. John. 
6: <a href="51.htm">51</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a>. But they said, This is a hard saying. Jesus said however, The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:-60,%2063&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:-60, 63</a>. </p>
<p>From this it is evident what is meant by 'eating' 
in the Holy Supper, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:%2026-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26: 26-28</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2014:%2022,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 14: 22, 23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:%2019,%2020%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22: 19, 20 -</a> having communication, being joined together, and making one's own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is also plain what is meant by the 
Lord's statement that </p>
<blockquote>
Many will come from the east and from the west and will recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%208:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 8: 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord did not mean that they were going to feast with these 
three in the kingdom of God but that they were to enjoy the celestial goods meant by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. That is to say, they were to enjoy the inmost celestial goods of love, meant by -Abraham'; 
also a lower type of goods, which are intermediate, as those are which belong to the rational, meant by 'Isaac'; and a still lower type of goods which are celestial-natural, such as occur in the first 
heaven, meant by 'Jacob'. These are the things which constitute the internal sense of these words. That such things are meant by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, see <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, and wherever else they are the 
subject. For whether one speaks of enjoying those celestial things, or whether one speaks of enjoying the Lord, whom they represent, it amounts to the same since the Lord is the source of all those things, 
and the Lord is their All in all. </p>

`Et comederunt': quod significet communicationem sic, constare potest a significatione `comedere' quod sit communicari, tum conjungi, quod ex Verbo quoque patet {1}: quod `comederent sanctificata sacrificiorum,

<p>sed dixerunt, Durus est hic sermo;... verum dixit Jesus, Verbo quae Ego loquor vobis, spiritus sunt et vita sunt, ibid. vers. 60, 63; </p>
<p>inde patet quid per `comedere' intelligitur in Sacra Cena, 
Matth. xxvi 26-28; Marc. xiv 22, 23; Luc. xxii 19, 20, nempe communicationem habere, conjungi, et appropriare sibi.  [4] Inde (t)etiam liquet quid intelligitur {3} per quod Dominus dixit, 	Quod multi 
ab oriente et occidente venient, et accumbent cum Abrahamo, Isaco et Jacobo, Matth. viii 11; </p>
<p>non quod cum illis in regno Dei comesturi sint, sed quod fruituri bonis caelestibus, quae per `Abrahamum, 
Isacum et Jacobum' significantur; nempe caelestibus amoris tam intimis, quae sunt `Abrahamus,' quam inferioribus quae sunt media, ut sunt rationalis, quae sunt `Isacus,' et adhuc inferioribus quae 
sunt caelestia naturalia, qualia sunt in primo caelo, quae per `Jacobum' intellecta sunt; haec sunt sensus interni bonum verborum; quod haec `Abrahamus, Isacus et Jacobus' sint, videatur n. 1893, et 
ubivis alibi ubi de illis agitur; nam sive dicatur, frui caelestibus illis, sive dicatur frui Domino, Qui per illos repraesentatur, idem est, nam a Domino omnia illa, et Dominus est Omne in omnibus illorum. 	@1
