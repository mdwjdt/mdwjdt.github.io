<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2868节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2868.</strong>“拿鹤的妾名叫流玛”表既具有偶像崇拜又具有良善的外邦人。 这从前面的事清楚可知，因为在前面，外邦人是由拿鹤的妻子所生的儿子来表示的，而此处，外邦人是由他的妾所生的儿子来表示的。如前所述，妻子所生的儿子是指那些教会外凭良善而具有兄弟情谊的外邦人（<a href="2863.htm">2863</a>节）；而现在这些儿子则是指那些教会外既具有偶像崇拜又具有良善的外邦人。因此，后者不象前者那样正统。尽管如此，他们仍是合法的，因为那时，使女或婢女所生的子女被视为合法。这从以下事实明显看出来：雅各的儿子是由使女或婢女辟拉和悉帕所生的（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.4.htm">30:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.12.htm">12</a>），并且源于他们的各支派不亚于源于利亚和拉结所生儿子的，事实上没有任何区别。然而，从创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.1.htm">33:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.7.htm">7</a>）清楚可知，区别还是有的。<br />那时，妻子为生育子女而给丈夫的使女或婢女叫妾，这从拉结的使女辟拉明显可知，她还被称为雅各的妾（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.22.htm">35:22</a>）。男人通过使女（或婢女）或妾生育子女在当时是允许的，以便那些教会外的人，以及那些教会中较为低等的人能以这种方式来代表。这个叫“流玛”的妾之名就体现了这类人的本质（<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>节），在此是指提升，因为这就是“流玛”这个词的含义。关于教会外那些民族和人民的状态和命运，可参看前文（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="932.htm">932</a>，<a href="1032.htm">1032</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="1366.htm">1366</a>，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>，<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。</p>

His concubine, whose name was Reumah. That this signifies Gentiles who are in idolatrous worship and in good, is evident from the things which precede; for in the former place are the Gentiles who are 
signified by the sons who were born to Nahor from his wife, and in this place are the Gentiles signified by those born from his concubine. By those from the wife were signified (as before shown) the 
Gentiles out of the church who are in brotherhood from good (n. 2863); those now signified are those out of the church who are in idolatrous worship and in good; thus these are not from so legitimate 
a stock as the former. Nevertheless they are as if legitimate; for at that time children who were born of maidservants were adopted as legitimate (as is evident from the sons of Jacob who were born of 
the maidservants Bilhah and Zilpah, Gen. 30:4-12; from whom tribes were derived equally as from those who were born of Leah and Rachel, and indeed without any difference). But that still there was a 
difference is evident from Genesis 33:1, 2, 6, 7. The maidservants who were at that time given to the husband by the wife for the sake of procreating children were called concubines; as is manifest from 
Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, who is also called Jacob's concubine (Gen. 35:22).  That men should procreate children from maidservants or concubines was tolerated at that time, in order that those 
who are out of the church might thus be represented, and also those who are in a lower degree within the church. The name of this concubine being said to be "Reumah" involves her quality (n. 1896, 2009); 
which here is exaltation, this being the meaning of the word "Reumah." (Concerning the state and lot of the nations and peoples who are out of the church, see above, n. 593, 932, 1032, 1059, 1327, 
1328, 1366, 2049, 2051, 2284, 2589-2604.) </p>

'His concubine, whose name was Reumah' means gentiles whose worship was idolatrous but in whom good was present. This becomes clear from what has gone before, for in the former place come those gentiles 
meant by the sons born to Nahor from his wife, in the latter those born from his concubine. As has been shown, those born from his wife were people outside the Church who dwelt in a brotherly relationship 
by virtue of good, <a href="2863.htm">2863</a>, whereas these latter sons are people outside the Church whose worship was idolatrous but in whom good was present. Thus the latter were born from a less legitimate union 
than the former, though the union was nevertheless legitimate, for in those times children born from servant-girls were accepted as legitimate, as becomes clear from Jacob's sons born from the servant-girls 
Bilhah and Zilpah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2030:%204-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 30: 4-12</a>, from whom tribes descended no less than from the sons born from Leah and Rachel, and who in this respect were no different from the latter. Yet that a difference 
did exist is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2033:%201,%202,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 33: 1, 2, 6, 7</a>. </p>

 Servant-girls whom in those times a wife gave to her husband for the sake of producing children were called concubines, as is evident from Bilhah, 
Rachel's servant-girl, who is also called Jacob's concubine in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35: 22</a>. The practice of producing children by means of servant-girls or concubines was allowed in those times so that those outside 
the Church might be represented, as well as those of lower degree within the Church. The statement that the concubine's name was Reumah embodies the essential nature of that group of people, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, which in this case is exaltation, this being what Reumah means.

`Concubina ejus et nomen ejus Reumah': quod significet gentiles qui in cultu idololatrico et in bono, constare potest ex illis quae praecedunt:  in priore enim loco sunt gentiles qui significati per 
illos qui nati Nahori ex uxore, in posteriore qui ex concubina; qui ex uxore, fuerunt, ut ostensum, illi extra Ecclesiam qui in fraternitate ex bono sunt, n. 2863; hi qui extra Ecclesiam in cultu idololatrico 
et in bono; ita hi non ex tam legitimo toro ac illi, usque tamen sicut legitimi, nam tunc temporis liberi qui nascebantur ex ancillis, ut legitimi adoptabantur, ut constare potest ex filiis 
Jacobi qui nati sunt ex ancillis Bilha et Zilpa, Gen. xxx 4-12, ex quibus aeque tribus, sicut ex illis qui nati ex Lea et Rachele, et quidem absque differentia; at quod usque differentia, constare potest 
ex Gen. xxxiii 1, 2, 6, 7; [2] ancillae quae tunc dabantur marito ab uxore procreandorum liberorum causa, vocabantur concubinae, ut patet ex Bilha ancilla Rachelis, quae quoque vocatur concubina Jacobi, 
Gen. xxxv 22.  Quod ex ancillis seu concubinis procrearent liberos, tunc temporis toleratum erat ut sic repraesentarentur illi qui extra ecclesiam, tum quoque illi qui in gradu inferiore intra 
Ecclesiam.  Quod dicatur nomen ejus `Reumah,' involvit quale ejus, n. 1896, 2009, hic exaltationem, quae significatur per `Reumah':  de statu et sorte gentium et populorum qui extra Ecclesiam, videatur
