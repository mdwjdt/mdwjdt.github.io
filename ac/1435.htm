<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1435节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1435．“连他们所积蓄的财物”表通过感官学到的一切真理。这从前面所述清楚可知。人所思想的一切知识都被称为“积蓄”或“财物”。没有这些知识的积蓄，没人能象人那样拥有任何思想观念。思想观念就建立在通过感官印象而留在记忆中的那些事物上。因此，知识是属灵事物的容器；而情感，就是来自良善的肉体愉悦，则是属天事物的容器。所有这些都被称为“所积蓄的财物”，事实上，“在哈兰所积蓄的财物”表示一种朦胧的状态，诸如从婴幼儿到童年时的那种状态。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1435.</strong> The symbolism of and all the gain that they had gained as everything that can be identified as sensory truth can be seen from the discussion.<br />Gain is the term for every fact on which we base our thinking. In our capacity as humans, we cannot entertain any fragment of thought without acquired facts. The concepts that compose our thinking are founded on facts, which enter through our senses and print themselves on our memory. So facts are containers for spiritual material, while feelings that rise out of positive types of bodily pleasure are containers for heavenly material. All of these are called "gain," and specifically gain acquired in Haran, which symbolizes the dim kind of state that characterizes children up till adolescence.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The term "dim" is not a reflection on the mental capacities of children. Swedenborg commonly uses this word (Latin obscurus) to characterize spiritually inchoate or defective states; see, for example, 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_24" target=_top>24</a> (of those before regeneration); 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34" target=_top>34</a> (of spirits who know doctrine but lack love); 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_178" target=_top>178</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_181" target=_top>181</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_184" target=_top>184</a> (of those first awakening after death); 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_443" target=_top>443</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_448" target=_top>448</a> (of life in this world in contrast to life in the other); 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_502" target=_top>502</a> (of the state of churches in decline).

And all the substance that they had gotten. That this signifies all things that are sensuous truths, is evident from what has already been said. All the memory-knowledge from which a man thinks, is called 
"acquisition" or "substance." Without the acquisition of memory-knowledges, a man cannot as a man have any idea of thought. The ideas of thought are founded upon those things which have been impressed 
on the memory from the things of sense; and therefore memory-knowledges are vessels of spiritual things; and affections that are from good pleasures of the body are vessels of celestial things. 
All these are called "the substance gotten," and indeed in Haran, by which is signified an obscure state, such as is that of infancy up to childhood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1435</b></p><p><b>1435.</b>
'And all the acquisitions that they had acquired' means all truths that have been learned through the senses. This is clear from what has been stated already. Every fact from which a person thinks is 
called 'an acquisition'. Until he has acquired such facts nobody can as a human being possess a single idea comprising thought. Such ideas are based on sensory impressions contained in the memory. Facts 
therefore are the vessels for spiritual things, while affections that are the product of bodily pleasures that are good are the vessels for celestial things. All of these are called 'acquisitions', 
and indeed those acquired 'in Haran', by which is meant an obscure state like that of infancy through to childhood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1435</b>
</p><b>1435.</b>
'Et omnem acquisitionem, quam acquisiverunt':  quod significet omnia quae sunt vera sensualia, constat ex illis quae dicta sunt; 'acquisitio' dicitur omne scientificum ex quo cogitat homo; absque scientificis 
acquisitis homo quatenus homo non ullam ideam cogitationis habere potest; ideae cogitationis fundantur super illis quae ex sensualibus impressa sunt memoriae; quare scientifica sunt vasa spiritualium, 
et affectiones ex voluptatibus corporis bonis sunt vasa caelestium; omnia haec vocantur 'acquisitiones,' et quidem 'in Harane,' quo significatur status obscurus qualis est infantiae ad pueritiam. </p>
