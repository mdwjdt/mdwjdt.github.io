<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8731节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8731.</strong>“摩西让他的岳父去”表神之真理的完全调整状态。这从以下事实清楚可知：一切事物被安排得井然有序，或被调整到它们的正确位置后，也就是说，当居间真理（主通过这些真理间接行动）已经从属于直接来自神的真理时，这就是该状态的目的。摩西让他的岳父去就描述了这一点；因为叶忒罗来到摩西这里，因而他们为此目的走到一起描述了该状态的开始。耶和华早些时候并没有吩咐叶忒罗说要立夫长或首领，好叫他们也审判百姓；但他们却由于叶忒罗的建议和敦促而被立，这是为了让本章的主题能以它的秩序被充分代表。因为前面论述的主题是那些属于属灵教会的人正在重生时，也就是说被主通过真理引导时所经历的第一个状态。不过，这个状态让位给了另一个状态，就是他们被主通过良善引导的状态。本章叶忒罗所描述的，就是一个状态转向或改变为另一个状态。</p>

And Moses let his father-in-law go. That this signifies a state of truth Divine accommodated, is evident from the fact that when all things have been reduced into order, that is, accommodated, namely, 
when mediate truths have been subordinated to the truth immediately from the Divine, it is the end of this state. This is described by Moses letting his father-in-law go; for the beginning of this state 
is described by Jethro's coming unto Moses, and by their being thus consociated for that end. The reason why it was not before commanded by Jehovah that princes should be set in order who also should 
judge the people, but that this was done by the counsel and persuasion of Jethro, was in order that the subject of this chapter might be fully represented in its order. For in what precedes, the 
subject treated of was the previous state in which are those of the spiritual church during regeneration, namely, when they are being led by the Lord by means of truth. To this state the other succeeds, 
which is that they are led by the Lord by means of good. This turning or change of one state into the other is what is described in this chapter by Jethro. </p>

'And Moses sent his father-in-law away' means the fully adjusted state of God's truth. This is clear from the consideration that after all things have been set in order or adjusted to their correct positions, 
that is to say, when the truths through which the Lord acts indirectly have been subordinated to the truth coming directly from God, it is the end of that state. This is described by the words 
'Moses sent his father-in-law away'; for the beginning of the state is described by Jethro's coming to Moses, and so by their coming together for that end. The reason why Jethro did not command earlier 
that rulers, who also were to judge the people, were to be appointed but that they were appointed as a result of Jethro's having counselled and urged it was in order that the reality that is the 
subject in this chapter might be represented fully in its order. For previously the subject was the first state which those belonging to the spiritual Church pass through when they are being regenerated, 
that is to say, when the Lord leads them by means of truth. But this state gives way to another, in which the Lord leads them by means of good. This turning or change of one state into another is 
what is described in this chapter by 'Jethro.' </p>

</p><b>8731.</b>
`Et dimisit Moscheh socerum suum': quod significet statum veri Divini accommodatum, constat ex eo quod postquam omnia in ordinem redacta sunt, hoc est, accommodata, nempe cum vera mediata subordinata 
sunt vero immediate a Divino, {1} sit finis illius status; hic describitur per quod `Moscheh dimisit socerum suum,' nam initium illius status describitur per quod {2}Jethro ad Moschen venerit, et sic 
consociati sint ob illum finem.  Quod non prius a Jehovah mandatum sit ut principes ordinarentur, qui etiam judicarent populum, sed quod ex consilio et suasu Jethronis id factum sit, erat {3}causa ut 
haec res, de qua in hoc capite agitur, plene in suo ordine repraesentaretur; nam in praecedentibus actum est de priore statu, in (x)quo sunt illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali cum regenerantur, nempe cum 
ducuntur a Domino per verum, {4}huic statui succedit alter, qui est ut ducantur a Domino per bonum; versura haec seu mutatio unius status in alterum {5} est quae in hoc capite per `Jethronem' describitur. 	@1 
i tunc$ 	@2 convenerint ac quod uniti sunt.  Non prius ad Moschen$ 	@3 propter repraesentationem rei de qua in hoc capite per quam illa res plene in suo ordine sisteretur$ 	@4 cui succedit 
status$ 	@5 i, quae post tentationes fit,$ </p>
