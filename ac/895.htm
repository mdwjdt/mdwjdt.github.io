<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第895节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>895.</strong>“地上的水都干了”表这时虚假不再显现。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知。这句话尤表虚假已从属于该教会成员的意愿之物中分离出去。此时出现“地上的水都干了”这句话，是因为这里的“地”表人的意愿，而人的意愿无非是恶欲。如前所述，土地位于人心智的觉知部分，真理就被播种在这一部分。真理绝不会被播种在意愿部分，意愿部分在属灵之人里面已经与觉知部分分离。这就是为何在本节最后经上会说“土地面干了”的原因。对上古教会成员而言，其心智的意愿部分有土地，主在此植入良善。因此，他正是通过良善而认识和感知真理，即他正是通过爱而拥有信。然而，若同样的事发生在现在，那人必永远灭亡，因为他的意愿已全然败坏。至于在意愿部分和觉知部分到底植入了什么，这从以下分析清楚可知：事实上，上古教会成员享有天启，他自小就经由天启开始进入对善与真的感知。但由于这些天启被植入在他的意愿部分，故他无需进一步的教导就能感知无数事物。因此，他仅从总体原则就能通过主知道细节和更细微之处，而如今，人们必须学习才能了解这些细节，甚至所知不及他们的千分之一。属灵的教会成员若不学习，就什么也不知道。他将以这种方式所知道的一切保留下来，并信以为真。实际上，若他学到了错误的东西，并且这错误的东西给他留下深刻印象，仿佛真的一样，那他也会相信它。因为他只会感知某件事是真的，他已经以这种方式相信了它。那些有良知的人通过良知拥有某种指示。然而，对他们而言，某件事之所以是真的，仅仅是因为他们听说并得知它是真的。这就是构成他们的良知之物，这一点从拥有虚假的良知之人清楚看出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]895.</strong> The meaning of the water drained off the earth as the fact that falsity did not appear at that time can be seen from earlier statements [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_857" target=_top>857</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868" target=_top>868</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_887" target=_top>887</a>]. Specifically it means that in the people of this church, falsity was siphoned away from the contents of their will. The earth here symbolizes human will, which is nothing but corrupt desire, and that is why it says that the water drained off the earth. The ground in us, as I have said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_875#subsection-2-3" target=_top>875:3</a>], is in our intellectual part, where truth is sown. By no means does "ground" exist in our volitional part, which in spiritual people is separate from the intellectual part. That is why the statement that the face of the ground had dried up comes later in the verse.<br />With the people of the earliest church, the "ground" was in their volitional part, and the Lord sowed it with the seed of goodness. As a result, they were able to recognize and perceive truth from the viewpoint of goodness, or in other words, to acquire faith from love. If the same thing happened today, it would necessarily destroy us forever, because our will is completely perverted.<br />[2] What happens when seed is sown on the will side, and what when it is sown on the intellectual side, can be seen from this: The people of the earliest church received revelations that initiated them into a perception of goodness and truth from the time they were very small. Because the seed was sown on their will side, they perceived innumerable things without further instruction; the Lord gave them the ability to look at one general concept and recognize particular ideas and individual details. These we now have to learn before we can know them, and yet we are hardly able to see even one in a thousand.<br />People in a spiritual church recognize only what they learn and so what they know about, remember, and believe to be true. In fact if they learn falsity, and it becomes stamped on their minds as truth, they believe it. They cannot help perceiving it as true because they are persuaded it is so. Those who have a conscience hear a kind of inner voice, but the voice does no more than tell them a thing is true because it is what they have heard and learned. This standard forms their conscience, as can be seen from people with misguided consciences. </p>

The waters were dried up from off the earth. That this signifies that falsities did not then appear, is evident from what has been said. Specifically it signifies that falsities have been separated from 
the things of the will of the man of this church. The "earth" here signifies man's will, which is nothing but cupidity; wherefore it is said that "the waters were dried up from off the earth." His 
"ground" as said above, is in his intellectual part, in which truths are sown-never in his will part, which in the spiritual man is separate from the intellectual; wherefore it is said afterwards in 
this verse that the face of the "ground" was dried. With the man of the Most Ancient Church there was ground in his will, in which the Lord sowed goods, and then from the goods the man could know and 
perceive truth, or from love could have faith; but if this method were followed now, man could not but perish eternally, for his will is wholly corrupted. How the case is with this sowing in man's will 
part, or-as is the case now-in his intellectual part, is evident from considering that revelations were made to the man of the Most Ancient Church by means of which he from his infancy was initiated 
into a perception of goods and truths, but as those revelations were sown in his will part, he without new instruction perceived innumerable things, so that from one general principle he knew from the 
Lord the particulars and the singulars which now men have to learn and so know, and yet after all they can know scarcely a thousandth part of them. For the man of the spiritual church knows nothing 
but what he learns, and what he knows in this way he retains and believes to be true. Indeed even if he learns what is false, and this is impressed on his mind as true, he believes it, because he has 
no other perception than that it is so, for so is he persuaded. Those who have conscience have from conscience a certain dictate, but no other than that a thing is true because they have so heard and 
learned. This is what forms their conscience, as is evident from those who have a conscience of what is false. </p>

'The waters dried up from over the earth' means that falsities were not at that time apparent. This is clear from what has been stated. In particular these words mean that falsities had been separated 
from things of the will belonging to the member of this Church. The statement 'the waters dried up from over the earth' occurs at this point because here 'earth' means the person's will, which is nothing 
but evil desire. As stated already, the ground is situated in the understanding part of man's mind, in which part truths are sown. No sowing ever takes place in the will part, which in the spiritual 
man has been separated from the understanding part. This is why in the last part of this verse it is said that 'the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground was dry'. With the member of the Most Ancient Church there 
was ground in the will part of his mind, where the Lord implanted goods. It was from goods therefore that he was able to know and perceive truth, that is, it was from love that he was able to possess 
faith. If the same thing were to happen today however, a person would inevitably and eternally perish, for his will is utterly corrupted. What implantation in the will part entails and what in the understanding 
part becomes clear from the consideration that the member of the Most Ancient Church had in fact enjoyed revelations through which from early childhood onwards he was led into a perception 
of goods and truths. But since they used to be implanted in the will part of his mind he perceived without any further instruction the countless aspects of any one general matter. He knew from the Lord 
the details and the finer points which nowadays men must learn before knowing about them. And even then they can know scarcely one thousandth of them. For the member of the spiritual Church knows nothing 
unless he acquires it by learning; and what he gets to know in this fashion he retains and believes to be true. Indeed if he learns something false and this is impressed on him as though it were 
true, he believes that as well, for he has no other perception than that a thing is true because he has in that way been persuaded of it. People who possess conscience derive from conscience a certain 
dictate. Yet with them a thing is true only because they have heard and learned that it is. This is what constitutes their conscience, as becomes clear from people who have a conscience of what is false.

Quod 'aruerunt aquae de super terra' significent quod falsitates tunc non apparerent, constat ab illis quae dicta sunt; in specie significant quod falsitates separatae sint a voluntariis hujus hominis 
Ecclesiae; 'terra' significat hic hominis voluntatem, quae non est nisi cupiditas, quare dicitur quod 'aquae aruerint de super terra'; humus ejus est, ut prius dictum, in parte hominis intellectuali, 
cui inseminantur vera; nusquam in parte ejus voluntaria, quae ab intellectuali in homine spirituali separata est; quare in sequentibus hujus versus dicitur 'quod arefactae sint facies humi': apud Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae hominem fuit humus in parte ejus voluntaria, cui inseminavit Dominus bona; de ex bonis nosse et percipere potuit verum, seu ex amore habere fidem; si nunc idem fieret, non potuisset 
non homo in aeternum perire, nam voluntas ejus prorsus corrupta est: quomodo inseminatio in partem voluntariam et in partem intellectualem hominis' se habeat, [2] inde constare potest quod Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae homini quidem fuissent revelationes, per quas in perceptionem bonorum et verorum ab infantia initiaretur, sed qua in voluntaria ejus parte inseminabantur, percipiebat absque nova instructione 
innumera sic ut ex uno communi, a Domino nosset particularia et singularia, quae nunc discere et sic scire debent, et vix tamen millesimam eorum partem scire possunt; nam homo Ecclesiae spiritualis 
nihil novit nisi quod discit; et quod sic scit, retinet et credit verum esse; immo si discit falsum, et hoc imprimitur ei sicut foret verum, etiam credit, quia non habet aliam perceptionem quam 
quod ita sit, quia ita persuasus: qui conscientiam habent, ex conscientia aliquod dictamen habent, sed non aliud quam quod verum sit, quia sic audiverunt et didicerunt; hoc conscientiam eorum format, 
quod constare potest ab iis qui conscientiam falsi habent. </p>
