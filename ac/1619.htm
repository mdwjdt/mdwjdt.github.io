<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1619节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">天使所在的光（续）；以及他们的天堂花园和居所</h4><br />1619．人的内在视觉，也就是灵的视觉若被打开，来世的事物就会显现，肉眼决无法看到这些事物。先知所看到的异象并非别的东西。如前所述，在天堂，天使经常看到主及其国的代表物，还有具有象征意义的事物，以至于凡出现在他们眼前的事物，无不具有代表性和象征意义。这就是圣言中代表性和象征意义的根源；因为圣言经由天堂从主而来。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1619.</strong> The Light in Which Angels Live (Continued); Their Magnificent Gardens and Their Dwellings<br />WHEN we gain access to inward sight (the sight of our spirit), we see the objects of the other world, which could never be presented to the sight of our physical eyes. This is exactly what the visions of the prophets were.<br />In heaven, as noted [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1619/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1532" target=_top>1532</a>], there are constant symbolic representations of the Lord and his kingdom. In fact every single thing the angels see represents and symbolizes something. This is the source of representation and symbolism in the Word, because the Word comes by way of heaven from the Lord. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1619</b></p><p><b>1619.</b>
CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ANGELS LIVE: ALSO CONCERNING THEIR PARADISAL SCENES, AND THEIR DWELLINGS. When man's interior sight is opened, which is the sight of his spirit, the things 
in the other life appear, which cannot possibly be made visible to the sight of the body. The visions of the prophets were nothing else. In heaven, as has been said, there are continual representations 
of the Lord and His kingdom; and there are things that are significative; and this to such an extent that nothing exists before the sight of the angels that is not representative and significative. 
Thence come the representatives and significatives in the Word; for the Word is from the Lord through heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1619</b></p><p><b>1619.</b>
THE LIGHT IN WHICH ANGELS ARE LIVING - continued; ALSO THEIR PARADISE GARDENS, AND THEIR DWELLING - PLACES </p>
<p>When a person's interior sight - the sight of his spirit - is opened, he then sees things 
in the next life, things that can never be manifested before his bodily eyes. The visions that the prophets had were nothing else. As has been stated, representatives of the Lord and of His kingdom, 
as well as meaningful signs, are to be seen constantly, so much so that nothing ever comes before the eyes of angels that is not a representative or a meaningful sign. This is the origin of representatives 
and of meaningful signs in the Word, for the Word derives from the Lord through heaven. </p>

</p><b>1619.</b>
Continuatio deLuce, in qua vivunt angeli; deque illorum Paradisiacis, et Habitaculis </p>
<p>Cum interior visus aperitur homini, qui est visus ejus spiritus tunc apparent illa quae in altera vita quae nusquam 
coram visu corporis sisti possunt videnda; prophetarum visiones non aliud fuerunt.  Sunt in caelo, ut dictum, continua repraesentativa Domini et Ipsius regni, et sunt significativa immo adeo ut 
nihil usquam coram visu angelorum existat quod non repraesentativum et significativum sit; inde repraesentativa et significativa in Verbo nam Verbum est per caelum a Domino. </p>
