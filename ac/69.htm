<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第69节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>69.</strong>其实人为主所造，即使活在肉身，也可以和精灵及天使对话。事实上，对于上古之人，这是常事。因为人本是套着肉身的灵，与精灵及天使同在。只是随着时间的推移，人逐渐沉迷于肉体和世界，对其它事漠不关心，那条路就封闭了。只要人不再沉迷于肉体，那条路又可以打通，从而进入精灵当中，和他们交往。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]69.</strong> The Lord created us to be capable of communicating with spirits and angels while still living in our bodies, as people actually did in the earliest times. After all, we are one with spirits and angels. In fact we ourselves are spirits clothed in flesh.<br />Over time, though, people have immersed themselves so deeply in bodily and worldly concerns that almost nothing else interests them, and so the path has closed; but as soon as the body-driven concerns that absorb us drop away, it opens and we find ourselves among spirits, living life together with them. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 69</b></p><p><b>69.</b>
Man was so created by the Lord as to be able while living in the body to speak with spirits and angels, as in fact was done in the most ancient times; for, being a spirit clothed with a body, he is one 
with them. But because in process of time men so immersed themselves in corporeal and worldly things as to care almost nothing for aught besides, the way was closed. Yet as soon as the corporeal things 
recede in which man is immersed, the way is again opened, and he is among spirits, and in a common life with them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 69</b></p><p><b>69.</b>
The human being has been created by the Lord in such a way that while living in the body he could at the same time talk to spirits and angels, as actually happened in most ancient times; for being a 
spirit clothed with a body he is one among them. But because, after a period of time, people have so immersed themselves in bodily and worldly interests that they hardly care about anything different, 
that path has therefore been closed. But as soon as the bodily interests in which a person is immersed retire into the background, the path is opened, and he finds himself among spirits and shares his 
life with them.

</p><b>69.</b>
Homo ita creatus a Domino est, ut dum vivit in corpore, cum spiritibus et angelis simul loqui potuisset, sicut etiam antiquissimis temporibus factum, nam unus est cum illis, quia spiritus corpore amictus: 
sed quia post tractum temporis homines se ita immerserunt corporeis et mundanis ut paene nihil aliud curent, ideo clausa est via; ut primum vero recedunt corporea quibus immersus, aperitur via, 
et inter spiritus est et cum iis sociat vitam. </p>
