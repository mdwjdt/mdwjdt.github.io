<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10787节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10787</strong>.后来，我们与他们谈论主，谈论对主之爱和对邻之爱，以及重生。我们说，爱主在于爱从祂所领受的诫命，也就是在于出于这爱而照它们生活；对邻之爱在于意愿善事，因而在于向同胞、祖国、教会和主的国行善事，但不是为了让自己被人看到，或为了获得赏赐，而是出于对良善的情感。关于重生，我们说，那些正在被主重生，毫不迟延地将真理融入生活的人就会获得对真理的内在直觉；而那些先把真理接入记忆，然后接入理解力，最后接入意愿的人是拥有信仰的人，因为他们出于这时被称为良心的信仰行事。这些灵人说，他们发觉这些事的确如此，因而还发觉什么叫信仰。</p>

We afterward spoke to them about the Lord, about love to Him, about love toward the neighbor, and about regeneration, saying that to love the Lord is to love the commandments which are from Him, that 
is, to live according to them from this love; that love toward the neighbor is to will good and from this to do good to one's fellow-citizen, to our country, to the church, to the Lord's kingdom, not 
for the sake of self, to be seen, or to have merit; but from the affection of good. With regard to regeneration, we said that those who are being regenerated by the Lord, and who introduce truths at 
once into the life, come into interior perception about them; but that those who receive truths first in the memory, and then in the understanding, and finally in the will, are those who are in faith; 
for they act from faith, which is then called conscience. They said that they perceived these things to be so, consequently also what faith is. </p>

Afterwards we talked to them about the Lord, about love to Him, about love towards the neighbour, and about regeneration. We said that loving the Lord consists in loving the commandments received from 
Him, that is, in being moved by love to lead a life in keeping with them, and that love towards the neighbour consists in willing what is good and therefore in doing what is good to a fellow citizen, 
one's country, the Church, and the Lord's kingdom, not for the selfish purpose of being seen or earning a reward, but from an affection for what is good. With regard to regeneration we said that those 
who are being regenerated by the Lord and incorporating truths without any delay into their life come to have an intuitive perception of them; but that those who receive truths first in their memory, 
then in the understanding, and finally in the will are those who possess faith, for faith, which at this point is called conscience, guides them in their actions. Those spirits then said that they 
saw with perception that all this was so, and consequently also perceived what faith was.  </p>

Postea loquebamur cum illis de Domino, de amore in Ipsum {1}de amore erga proximum, deque regeneratione; quod amare Dominum sit amare praecepta quae ab Ipso, quod est, ex amore vivere secundum illa; 
quod amor erga proximum {2} sit velle bonum et inde facere bonum concivi, patriae, Ecclesiae, {3} regno Domini, non propter se ut videatur vel ut mereatur, sed ex affectione boni; {4}de regeneratione, 
quod illi qui regenerantur a Domino, et immittunt vera ilico in vitam, in interiorem perceptionem de illis veniant; at quod illi qui recipiunt vera primum in memoria, et dein in intellectu, et demum 
in voluntate, {5} sint qui {6}in fide sunt, nam ex fide, quae tunc vocatur conscientia, {7}agunt.  {8}Haec dixerunt se percipere quod ita sit, proinde etiam quid fides. @1 quod sit amare praecepta quae
