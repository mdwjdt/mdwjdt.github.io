<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2324节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2324.</strong>“罗得正坐在所多玛城门口”表那些拥有仁之善，但处于外在敬拜的人，他们在此由罗得来代表；这些人在恶人当中，但与他们分开了，也就是“坐在所多玛城门口”。这从“罗得”的代表，以及“城门口”和“所多玛”的含义清楚可知。从罗得的代表清楚可知：当与亚伯拉罕在一起时，罗得代表主的感官部分，因而代表祂的外在人，如第一卷所示（<a href="1428.htm">1428</a>，<a href="1434.htm">1434</a>，<a href="1547.htm">1547</a>节）。但现在，他与亚伯拉罕分开了，不再代表主，而是代表那些与主同在之人，也就是教会的外在成员，即那些拥有仁之善，但处于外在敬拜的人。<br />事实上，在本章，罗得不仅代表诸如一开始的教会外在成员，或也可说外在教会的性质，还代表发展中和末期的。“摩押”和“亚扪人”所表示的，正是该教会的末期。蒙主怜悯，这可从下文一系列事件清楚看出来。在圣言中，一个人代表很多连续状态是很常见的。这些状态以这人生活中的连续行为来描述。<br />从“城门口”的含义清楚可知：人进、出城市的地方就是“城门口”，所以，“坐在城门口”在此其实表示与恶人同在，但仍与他们分开，这是具有仁之善的教会中人常见的情形。他们尽管在恶人当中，但仍与他们分开，当然不是指在市民社会中分开，而是指在属灵生活中分开。“所多玛”表总体上的邪恶，或也可说恶人，尤其教会中人，如前所述（<a href="2322.htm">2322</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2324</b></p><p><b>2324.</b>
And Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. That this signifies those who are in the good of charity, but in external worship, who here are "Lot," and who are among the evil, but separate from them-which 
is to "sit in the gate of Sodom"-can be seen from the representation of "Lot," and from the signification of "gate," and also from that of "Sodom." From the representation of "Lot:" Lot when with Abraham 
represented the Lord's sensuous part, thus His external man (as shown in Volume 1, n. 1428, 1434, 1547). But here, when separated from Abraham, Lot no longer retains the representation of the Lord, 
but the representation of those who are with the Lord, namely, the external man of the church, that is, those who are in the good of charity, but in external worship. [2] No, in this chapter Lot 
not only represents the external man of the church, or what is the same, the external church such as it is in the beginning, but also such as it is in its progress, and also in its end. It is the end 
of that church which is signified by "Moab" and the "son of Ammon," as of the Lord's Divine mercy will appear from the series of the things that follow. It is a common thing in the Word for one person 
to represent a number of states that succeed each other, and which are described by the successive acts of his life. [3] From the signification of a "gate:" a gate is that through which one enters 
into a city, and through which he goes out of the city; consequently, to "sit in the gate" does indeed here signify to be with the evil, but still to be separate from them; as is wont to be the case with 
the men of the church who are in the good of charity; these, although they are among the wicked, are still separate from them; not as to civic society, but as to spiritual life. (That "Sodom" signifies 
evil in general, or what is the same, the evil, especially within the church, was said above, n. 2322.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2324</b></p><p><b>2324.</b>
'And Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom' means those people with whom the good of charity exists but whose worship is external - people represented by 'Lot' here - who are among and yet separate 
from the evil, which is meant by his 'sitting in the gateway of Sodom'. This becomes clear from the representation of 'Lot', and from the meaning of 'a gateway' and also of 'Sodom': </p>
<p> From the representation 
of Lot: When Lot and Abraham were together he represented the Lord's sensory perception, and so His External, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="1428.htm">1428</a>, <a href="1434.htm">1434</a>, <a href="1547.htm">1547</a>. But now that he has separated from 
Abraham he ceases to represent the Lord any longer and instead represents those who are with the Lord, namely the external member of the Church - those with whom the good of charity exists but whose worship 
is external. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Indeed in the present chapter Lot represents the external member of the Church, or what amounts to the same, the nature of the external Church, not only as it is at the outset, 
but also as it is in its development, and as it is at the latter end too. The latter end of that Church is what is meant by Moab and the son of Ammon, as will be clear, in the Lord's Divine mercy, 
from the sequence of events described in what follows. In the Word it is common for one person to represent many consecutive states, which are described as consecutive actions in his life. </p>
<p>From the 
meaning of 'a gateway': A gateway is the place through which people enter or leave a city, and therefore 'sitting in the gateway' here means being indeed among and yet separate from the evil, as is 
normally the case with members of the Church with whom good that stems from charity exists. Though they are together with the evil they are nevertheless separate from them, not as regards civil society 
but as regards spiritual life. </p>
<p>'Sodom' means evil in general, or what amounts to the same, the evil, especially those inside the Church, as has been stated above, in <a href="2322.htm">2322</a>. </p>

</p><b>2324.</b>
`Et Lot sedens in porta Sodomae': quod significet illos qui in bono charitatis sunt at in cultu externo, qui hic sunt `Lot,' qui inter malos sed separati ab illis, quod est `sedere in porta Sodomae,' 
constare potest a repraesentatione `Loti,' et a significatione `portae,' tum `Sodomae.' A repraesentatione Loti: `Lot' quando fuit cum Abrahamo, repraesentavit sensuale Domini, ita Ipsius Externum, 
ut in Parte Prima, n. 1428, 1434, 1547 ostensum; nunc cum separatus est ab Abrahamo, non amplius retinet repraesentationem Domini, sed repraesentationem eorum qui apud Dominum sunt, nempe externum hominem 
Ecclesiae, qui sunt illi qui in bono charitatis sunt at in cultu externo; immo Lot in hoc capite non solum repraesentat externum hominem Ecclesiae, seu quod idem, Ecclesiam externam, qualis est in 
principio, sed etiam qualis est in progressu, tum quoque in fine; finis illius Ecclesiae est qui significatur per `Moabum et filium Ammonis,' ut a sequentium serie, ex Divina Domini Misericordia constabit; 
in Verbo commune est quod unus repraesentet plures status qui succedunt, qui describuntur per vitae ejus successivos actus.  A significatione `portae': porta est per quam intratur in urbem, et 
per quam exitur ab urbe, proinde `sedere in porta' significat hic quidem esse apud malos, sed usque separatum esse ab illis, sicut solent homines Ecclesiae qui in bono charitatis sunt; ii tametsi cum 
malis sunt, usque sunt ab illis separati, non quoad societatem civilem sed quoad vitam spiritualem.  Quod `Sodoma' significet malum in genere, seu quod idem {1}, malos, imprimis intra Ecclesiam, supra 
n. 2322 dictum. 	@1 i est.$ </p>
