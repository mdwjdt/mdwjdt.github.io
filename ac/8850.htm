<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8850节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8850.</strong>有一个秃头被指给我看，不过我只看到骨瘦如柴的头顶。这时我被告知，那些一年内就要死去的人就会看到这种形像；然后他们便做好准备。在木星，他们并不害怕死亡，只怕离开配偶，孩子或父母；因为他们知道自己死后会活着，知道自己既然往天堂去，就不会舍弃生命。这也解释了为何他们并不将死亡称为死亡，而是称为变成天堂。在木星，那些过着充满婚姻之爱的幸福生活，并如父母所应该的那样照顾自己的孩子之人不会死于疾病，而是好像睡着了，平平安安离去，就这样从世界移居天堂。</p>

I was shown a bald head, but only its highest part, which was bony; and I was told that such an appearance is seen by those who are to die within a year, and that they then prepare themselves. On that 
earth they do not fear death, except on account of leaving their consort, their children, or their parents; for they know that they will live after death, and that they do not go out of life, because 
they go into heaven; and therefore they do not speak of dying, but of being heaven-made. Those who on that earth have lived happy in conjugial love, and have taken care of their children as it becomes 
parents to do, do not die by diseases, but tranquilly, as in sleep, and thus migrate from the world into heaven. </p>

I was shown a bald head, but only the top of it, which was bony. Then I was told that such a thing is seen by those who are going to die within a year, and that they then prepare themselves. For on that 
planet they have no fear of death, except that they leave behind married partner, children, or parents; for they know that they will be alive after death and that they do not relinquish life, since 
they go to heaven. This also explains why dying is not called dying by them but being heavenized. Those on that planet who have led lives happily filled with conjugial love, and have looked after their 
children as parents ought, do not die from sicknesses but peacefully, as in sleep, and in that condition pass from the world into heaven. </p>

</p><b>8850.</b>
Ostensum mihi est calvitium, sed modo suprema ejus pars, quae ossea; et dicebatur quod tale videant illi qui intra annum morituri sunt, et quod tunc se praeparent.  Ibi mortem non timent, nisi propter 
quod relinquant conjugem, liberos, aut parentes, nam sciunt quod post mortem victuri sint, et quod {1}e vita non abeant, quia in caelum; quapropter etiam mori non vocant mori, sed caelificari.  Qui 
in illa tellure vixerunt {2}in amore conjugiali felices, et curam liberorum sicut parentes decet, habuerunt, illi non moriuntur per morbos, sed tranquille sicut in somno, ac ita transmigrant e mundo 
in caelum. @1 After non$  @2 i plerique$  </p>
