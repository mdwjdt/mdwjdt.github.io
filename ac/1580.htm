<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1580节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1580.</strong>“遍地不都在你眼前吗”表一切良善。这从“地”的正面含义清楚可知，此处“迦南地”是指属天之物，因此指良善（对此，参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>节）。内在人在此对外在人说话，确切地说，对外在人中那些不一致的东西说话；当人觉察到自己里面的某种邪恶，想要与之分离时，就经常这样做，如处于试探和冲突时的情形。那些曾经历试探和冲突的人都知道，他们发觉自己里面有不一致的东西；只要还存在冲突，就无法与之分离；但他们仍渴望分离，有时甚至到了对罪恶充满愤怒，想要将其逐出的程度。这些就是此处所表示的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1580.</strong> The symbolism of Is the whole land not before you? as every benefit can be seen from the symbolism of land in a good sense 钬?here, the land of Canaan 钬?as something heavenly and so as something beneficial (discussed above at 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1580/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1580/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1580/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636" target=_top>636</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1580/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a>).<br />The inner self addresses the outer here, but what it addresses are the features of the outer self that clash. This is a common occurrence among people who notice in themselves some evil from which they want to separate, as they do in times of spiritual trial and battle. As those who have been through such trials and battles realize, they notice discordant elements inside themselves that they cannot get away from as long as the fight continues. Nevertheless they do still long to get away 钬?so fervently, sometimes, that they grow angry with the evil and try to expel it. This is what is symbolized here. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1580</b></p><p><b>1580.</b>
Is not the whole land before thee? That this signifies all good, is evident from the signification of "land" in a good sense, and here of the land of Canaan, which is the celestial, and therefore also 
good (concerning which see above, n. 566, 620, 636, 662). The internal man here addresses the external, but those things in the external man which disagree; as a man is wont to do when he perceives 
some evil in himself from which he desires to be separated, as is the case in temptations and combats. For it is known to those who have been in temptations and combats, that they perceive in themselves 
things which disagree; from which, so long as there is combat, they cannot be separated; but still they desire separation, and sometimes to such a degree that they are angry with the evil, and desire 
to expel it. These are the things that are here signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1580</b></p><p><b>1580.</b>
That 'is not the whole land before you?' means all good is clear from the meaning in the good sense of 'land', here 'the land of Canaan', as the celestial, and therefore goodness, dealt with already 
in <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>. Here the internal man addresses the external man, or rather addresses these things in the external man which do not agree with the internal, addressing them in the way that a person 
is accustomed to do when he detects some evil present in himself from which he wishes to be separated, as happens in times of temptation and conflict. It is the well known experience of those who 
have undergone temptations and conflicts to detect within themselves things that disagree, from which they cannot be separated as long as conflict exists. Yet they still desire such a separation; indeed 
they sometimes desire it so much that they are furious with that evil and want to drive it out. These are the things meant here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1580</b>
</p><b>1580.</b>
'Nonne tota terra coram te?': quod significet omne bonum, constat a significatione 'terra' in bono sensu, et hic 'terrae Canaanis' quod sit caeleste, proinde quod sit bonum, de qua prius n. 566, 620, 
636, 662.  Alloquitur hic internus homo externum, sed illa quae apud externum discordant, sicut solet homo cum appercipit malum quoddam apud se, a quo separari vult, ut fit in tentationibus et pugnis; 
notum enim est illis qui fuerunt in tentationibus et pugnis, quod appercipiant apud se quae discordant, a quibus quamdiu est pugna, separari nequeunt, sed usque desiderant separationem, immo quandoque 
adeo ut irascantur malo, et velint id expellere; haec sunt quae hic significantur. </p>
