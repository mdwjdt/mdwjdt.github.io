<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2308节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2308.</strong>在来世，没有人会因遗传的罪恶受到惩罚，因为这恶并非他的，因此他不必为具有这样的性质承担责任。但每个人都会由于自己所行之恶受苦，因而为如他通过实际生活归于自己那样多的遗传之恶负责，如前所述（<a href="966.htm">966</a>节）。让长大的孩子回到其遗传的罪恶中不是为了惩罚，而是要他们知道，他们本身无非是恶。他们从与其同在的地狱被带到天堂，完全是凭着主的怜悯。他们进入天堂，不是凭自己的功德，而是靠着主，从而防止他们在别人面前夸耀自己里面的良善。因为这与信的真理，与天堂彼此相爱的良善是背道而驰的。</p>

No one ever suffers punishment in the other life on account of hereditary evil, because it is not his, and therefore he is not to blame for being of such a nature; but everyone suffers on account of 
the actual evil which is his own, and consequently for so much of the hereditary evil as he has appropriated to himself by actual life (as before said, n. 966). It is not therefore for the sake of punishment 
that the little children on becoming adult are remitted into the state of their hereditary evil; but that they may know that of themselves they are nothing but evil, and that it is of the Lord's 
mercy that they are taken away from the hell that is with them into heaven; and that they are not in heaven by their own merit, but of the Lord; and thereby to prevent them from boasting before others 
of the good that is in them; for this is contrary to the good of mutual love, as it is contrary to the truth of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2308</b></p><p><b>2308.</b>
In the next life no one ever undergoes punishment on account of hereditary evil, since this is not his own and thus he is not at fault for being such. He undergoes it on account of the evil of his own 
doing, thus for that amount of hereditary evil which he makes his own by his own actions in life, as stated already in <a href="966.htm">966</a>. The reason for returning the young children, when they have become adult, 
to the state of their hereditary evil is not therefore so that they may undergo punishment, but so that they may know that of themselves they are nothing but evil, and that it is in the Lord's mercy they 
are taken away from the hell that exists with them into heaven, and that they are not in heaven on account of any merit of their own but on account of the Lord. In this way they are prevented from 
boasting to others of the good that exists with them, for that is contrary to the good flowing from mutual love, as it is contrary to the truth of faith. </p>

</p><b>2308.</b>
Nusquam aliquis in altera vita luit poenam propter malum hereditarium quia ejus non est, ita non in culpa quod talis sit, sed propter malum actuale quod ipsius est, ita quoque quantum ex malo hereditario 
per actualem vitam sibi appropriavit, ut prius n. 966 dictum est: quod infantes adulti facti remittantur in statim mali sui hereditarii, non est ideo ut poenam luant sed ut sciant quod ex se non 
nisi malum sint, et quod ab inferno quod apud eo ex misericordia Domini in caelum auferantur, et quod in caelo non sint ex merito sui sed ex Domino; et sic ne ex bono quod apud eos, se coram aliis jactent; 
nam hoc est contra bonum amoris mutui, sicut est contra verum fidei.
