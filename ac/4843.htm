<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4843节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4843.</strong>“对他儿媳他玛”表代表属灵和属天之物的教会，它因真理而被称为“儿媳”。这从“他玛”的代表和“儿媳”的含义清楚可知：“他玛”是指代表属灵和属天之物的教会，如前所述（<a href="4831.htm">4831</a>节）；“儿媳”是指教会的属灵元素，也就是真理。“儿媳”在内义上之所以具有这种含义，是因为属于婚姻的一切事物和从婚姻所生的所有人都代表属于属天婚姻的那类事物（参看<a href="4837.htm">4837</a>节），因而代表属于良善与真理的那类事物；因为这些是属天婚姻中的两个伴侣。这就是为何在圣言中，“丈夫”表示良善，“妻子”表示真理；以及为何儿子和女儿表示来自它们的良善与真理。因此，儿媳因是现成为丈夫的儿子的妻子，故表示与良善结合的教会真理等等。但这些含义对那些属于属天教会的人，却不同于对那些属于属灵教会的人；因为在属灵教会，丈夫被称为“男人”，表示真理；妻子被称为“女人”，表示良善（参看<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>节）。<br />就圣言的内义而言，“儿媳”表示与教会良善联结的教会真理，因而在反面意义上表示与教会邪恶联结的教会虚假；这一点从圣言中提及“儿媳（经上或译为儿妇、媳妇）”的经文也可以看出来，如何西阿书：<br />他们在各山顶献祭，在各高冈的橡树、杨树、栗树之下烧香，因为树影美好。所以，你们的女儿淫乱，你们的儿妇行淫。你们的女儿淫乱，你们的儿妇行淫，我岂不惩罚她们？（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.13.htm">4:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处所论述的主题对邪恶与虚假的敬拜，对邪恶的敬拜由“在各山顶献祭”来表示，对虚假的敬拜由“在各高冈烧香”来表示。邪恶的生活由“淫乱的女儿”来表示，邪恶生活所来自的虚假教义由“行淫的儿妇”来表示。在圣言中，奸淫和淫乱表示对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲（参看<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）。因此，“儿妇”在此表示对虚假的情感。<br />弥迦书：<br />位分大的说出心里的恶欲，将它歪曲变形。他们最好的，不过像蒺藜；最正直的，不过如荆棘篱笆。儿子藐视父亲，女儿起来反对母亲，儿媳与婆婆作对；人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.3.htm">7:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.6.htm">6</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是源于邪恶的虚假，在被荒废之时的末期，教会便陷入这种虚假；在近似意义上是犹太教会所陷入的虚假。“女儿起来反对母亲”表示对邪恶的情感反对真理；“儿媳与婆婆作对”表示对虚假的情感反对良善。<br />由于经历试探之人的情形与此性质相似，事实上，在试探中，争战或冲突就发生在邪恶与真理，以及虚假与良善之间，所以属灵的试探无非是存在于人里面的虚假与邪恶被消磨的经历；因此，主在马太福音中以几乎一样的话来描述试探，或属灵的争战：<br />耶稣说，你们不要以为我来了，是要给地上带来和平；我来并不是带和平，乃是带刀剑。因为我来是叫人与父亲不和，女儿与母亲不和，媳妇与婆婆不和；人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.34.htm">10:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.36.htm">36</a>）<br />刚才从先知书所引用的这些话表示教会的荒废。但此处它们表示那些属教会之人的试探，因为如前所述，试探无非是虚假与邪恶的荒废或除去。因此，水的泛滥和洪水既表示并描述了试探，也表示并描述了消磨（<a href="705.htm">705</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="756.htm">756</a>，<a href="907.htm">907</a>节）。所以，“与母亲不和的女儿”在此也表示对反对真理的邪恶的情感，“与婆婆不和的媳妇”表示对反对良善的虚假的情感。由于在经历试探的人里面，邪恶与虚假在里面，或是他自己的，所以经上说它们是他家里的，即“人的仇敌就是自己家里的人”。这段经文描述了试探，这一事实从主说他来不是要给地上带来和平，乃是带刀剑明显看出来；因为“刀剑”表示进行争战的真理，在反面意义表示进行争战的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>节）。而事实上，祂的确来赐予和平（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.27.htm">14:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.33.htm">16:33</a>）。这段经文描述了试探，这一点也可从主接下来的话清楚看出来：不背着他的十字架跟从我的，不配是我的。<br />在路加福音也一样：<br />你们以为我来是将和平给地上么？我告诉你们：不是，是要有纷争；从今以后，一家五个人将要纷争：三个对两个，两个对三个。父亲和儿子相争，儿子和父亲相争；母亲和女儿相争，女儿和母亲相争；婆婆和媳妇相争，媳妇和婆婆相争。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.51.htm">12:51</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.53.htm">53</a>）<br />从这些话也明显可知，“父亲”、“母亲”、“儿子”、“女儿”、“媳妇”和“婆婆”表示那些来源于属天婚姻的事物，即在自己次序中的良善与真理，以及它们的对立面；在马可福音中同样如此：<br />耶稣说，人为我和福音撇下房屋，或是弟兄、姐妹、父母、妻子、儿女、田地，没有不在今世得百倍的，就是房屋、弟兄、姐妹、母亲、儿女、田地，并且要受逼迫；在来世必得永生。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.29.htm">10:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.30.htm">30</a>）<br />凡不了解圣言内义的人会以为此处这些话无非是指“房屋、弟兄、姐妹、父母、妻子、儿女、田地”。但此处的意思是这样：属于人，是他自己的那类事物必被他抛弃；他必接受属于主的属灵和属天事物以取代之。这种改变通过试探实现，试探在此由“逼迫”来表示。谁都能看出，人若抛弃母亲，就不会接受母亲，同样不会接受弟兄、姐妹等等。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4843</b></p><p><b>4843.</b>
To Tamar his daughter-in-law. That this signifies a church representative of spiritual and celestial things, which is called "daughter-in-law" from truth, is evident from the representation of Tamar, 
as being a church representative of spiritual and celestial things, of which above (n. 4831); and from the signification of a "daughter-in-law" as being the spiritual or truth of the church. That a "daughter-in-law" 
has this meaning in the internal sense is because all things belonging to marriage, and all who were born from marriage, represented such things as are of the heavenly marriage (see n. 
4837), and consequently which are of good and truth; for these are of the heavenly marriage. From this it is that in the Word a husband signifies good, and a wife truth; and also that sons and daughters 
signify the truths and goods that are from them. Hence a daughter-in-law, being the wife of a son now become a husband, signifies the truth of the church conjoined with good and so on. But in regard 
to those who are of the celestial church these significations are different from what they are in regard to those who are of the spiritual church; for in the spiritual church the husband is called 
"man," and signifies truth; and the wife is called "woman," and signifies good (see n. 4823). [2] That by a "daughter-in-law" in the internal sense of the Word is signified the truth of the church adjoined 
to its good, consequently in the opposite sense the falsity of the church adjoined to its evil, is also evident from the passages in the Word in which "daughter-in-law" is mentioned-as in Hosea: 
 They sacrifice upon the heads of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under the oak, and the poplar, and the terebinth, because the shadow thereof is good; therefore your daughters commit 
whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. Shall not I visit upon your daughters because they commit whoredom, and upon your daughters-in-law because they commit adultery? (Hos. 4:13-14); </p>
<p>where 
the subject treated of is the worship of evil and falsity, the worship of evil being signified by "sacrificing upon the heads of the mountains," and the worship of falsity by "burning incense 
upon the hills." A life of evil is signified by the "daughters committing whoredom," and the doctrine of falsity from which is a life of evil is signified by the "daughters-in-law committing adultery." 
That in the Word adulteries and whoredoms signify adulterations of good and falsifications of truth may be seen above (n. 2466, 2729, 3399); and therefore "daughters-in-law" here denote affections 
of falsity. [3] In Micah: </p>
<p>     The great one speaketh the perversity of his soul; and he wresteth it. Their good one is as a thorn; the upright, as a bramble. The son lightly esteemeth the father, the 
daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's foes are they of his household (Micah 7:3-4, 6); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is the falsity from evil 
in which the church is in the last time, when vastated, and in the proximate sense that in which the Jewish Church was. The "daughter rising up against her mother," signifies that the affection of evil 
is opposed to truth; and the "daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law," that the affection of falsity is opposed to good. [4] As the case is similar with the man who is in temptations-for in these 
there is a combat of evil against truth and of falsity against good, spiritual temptations being nothing else than vastations of the falsity and evil in a man-therefore temptations or spiritual combats 
are described by the Lord in almost the same words, in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Think not that I am come to send peace on the earth; I am not come to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set 
a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes shall be they of his household (Matt. 10:34-36); </p>
<p>the 
like words quoted just above from the prophet signified the vastation of the church, but here they signify the temptations of those who are of the church, because as already said temptations are nothing 
else than vastations, or removals, of falsity and evil; and for this reason both temptations and vastations are also signified and described by inundations of water and by floods (n. 705, 739, 756, 
907). Here also therefore the "daughter being at variance against her mother" denotes the affection of evil opposed to truth, and the "daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law," the affection of falsity 
opposed to good; and because in the man who is in temptation evils and falsities are within or are his, they are said to be of his household-"a man's foes shall be they of his household." That temptations 
are what are thus described is plain from the Lord's saying that He came not to send peace upon the earth, but a sword, for by a "sword" is signified truth combating, and in the opposite sense 
falsity combating (n. 2799, 4499), when yet He came to give peace (John 14:27; 16:33). That it is temptations which are so described is evident from what follows in that chapter: "He that taketh not 
up his cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me." [5] So also in Luke: </p>
<p>     Suppose ye that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but division; for from henceforth there 
shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter 
against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law (Luke 12:51-53); </p>
<p>from these sayings also it is plain that by "father," "mother," 
"son," "daughter," "daughter-in-law," and "mother-in-law" are signified those things which are from the heavenly marriage, namely, goods and truths in their order, and also their opposites; as likewise 
in Mark: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, There is no man that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields, for My sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive a hundred-fold 
in this time, houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life (Mark 10:29-30); </p>
<p>one unacquainted with the internal 
sense of the Word will suppose that nothing more than house, brethren, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, and fields are signified by these words here; but it is such things as appertain to man, 
his own, which he must forsake; and the spiritual and celestial things that are of the Lord which he must receive in their place, and this by means of temptations, which are meant by "persecutions." 
Everyone can see that if he forsake a mother he will not receive mothers; in like manner neither brethren, sisters, etc. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4843</b></p><p><b>4843.</b>
'To Tamar his daughter-in-law' means a Church representative of spiritual and celestial things, which is called 'a daughter-in-law' from truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Tamar' as a Church 
representative of spiritual and celestial things, dealt with above in <a href="4831.htm">4831</a>, and from the meaning of 'e daughter-in-law' as the spiritual element of the Church, which is truth. The reason 'a daughter-in-law' 
has this meaning in the internal sense is that everything connected with a marriage, and all persons who were the offspring of a marriage, represented the kinds of things that belong to the 
heavenly marriage, see above in <a href="4837.htm">4837</a>, and consequently the kinds of things that belong to good and truth since these are the two partners in the heavenly marriage. This is why in the Word 'husband' 
means good and 'wife' truth, and also why 'sons and daughters' means the forms of truth and good which are the offspring of these. Consequently, being the wife of a son who has now become a husband, 
'a daughter-in-law' means the truth of the Church which has been joined to good, and so on. But the meaning is different in the case of those who belong to the celestial Church from that of those who 
belong to the spiritual Church; for in the spiritual Church the husband is called 'the men' and means truth, while the wife is called 'the woman' and means good, see above in <a href="4823.htm">4823</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards 'a 
daughter-in-law' in the internal sense of the Word meaning the truth of the Church linked to its good, and consequently in the contrary sense meaning the falsity of the Church linked to its evil, this 
may also be seen from places in the Word where the expression 'daughter-in-law' is used, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
They offer sacrifice on mountain-tops and burn incense on hills, under oak. and poplar, and 
hard oak, because its shade is good Therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. Shall I not punish<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> your daughters, in that they commit whoredom and your daughters-in-law 
in that they commit adultery? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%204:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 4:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the worship of evil and falsity, the worship of evil being meant by 'offering sacrifices on mountain-tops' and the worship of 
falsity by 'burning incense on hills'. A life of evil is meant by 'daughters committing whoredom', and the teaching of what is false from which a life of evil results is meant by 'daughters-in-law committing 
adultery'. As regards acts of adultery and whoredom in the Word meaning adulterations of what is good and falsifications of what is true, see <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>. 'Daughters-in-law' therefore stands 
here for affections for falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
The great man utters the perversity of his soul. and he twists it out of shape The best of them is like a brier, the upright like a thorn-bush. 
The son treats the father with contempt, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are those of his own household. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:3,%204,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:3, 4, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to falsity that is the offspring of evil and which exists with the Church in the last times when it has been laid waste, in the proximate sense as it existed with the Jewish Church. 'The 
daughter rises up against her mother' means that the affection for evil stands opposed to truth, and 'the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law' that the affection for falsity stands opposed to good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
Because the experience of a person undergoing temptations is of a similar nature to this - for in temptations a conflict takes place between evil and truth and between falsity and good, spiritual 
temptations being nothing else than experiences when the falsity and evil present in a person are laid waste - temptations or spiritual conflicts are described by the Lord in practically the same 
words, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her 
mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's enemies will be these of his own household. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:34-36,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:34-36, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The words from the Prophet that are similar to these, quoted a 
little above them, meant the laying waste of the Church. But here the temptations of those who belong to the Church are meant, for, as has been stated, temptations are nothing else than experiences in 
which falsity and evil are laid waste or taken away. For this reason also temptations as well as vastations are meant and described by deluges and floods of waters, <a href="705.htm">705</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="756.htm">756</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>. Here also therefore 
'daughter against mother' means the affection for evil standing opposed to truth, and 'daughter-in-law against mother-in-law' the affection for falsity standing opposed to good. Now because the 
evils and falsities present with a person undergoing temptation exist inwardly, or are his own, they are called members of his own household in the words 'a man's enemies will be those of his own household'. 
The fact that temptations are described in this passage is evident from the Lord's saying that He had not come to bring peace on earth but a sword; for 'a sword' means truth engaged in conflict, 
and in the contrary sense falsity engaged in conflict, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>. (Yet He did come to bring peace, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:27;%2016:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:27; 16:33</a>.) The description of temptations in this passage is also clear from what the Lord 
goes on to say -'He who does not take up his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Similarly in Luke, </p>
<p>Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division; 
for from now on there will be in one house five divided, three against two, and two against three. Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter 
against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:51-53&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:51-53</a>. </p>
<p>From these words too it is evident that 'father', 'mother', 'son', 'daughter', 
'daughter-in-law', and 'mother-in-law' mean the kinds of things that originate in the heavenly marriage, namely goods and truths in their own order, and also their opposites; as also in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said, There is no one who has forsaken house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for the sake of Me and of the Gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold, 
now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone unacquainted with the internal 
sense of the Word will think that 'house', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'father', 'mother', 'wife', 'children', and 'fields' mean house, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, and fields. 
But the meaning here is this: The kinds of things present in a person which are properly his own must be forsaken by him, and instead of these, spiritual and celestial things which are the Lord's must 
be received by him. This change is effected by means of temptations, which are meant here by 'persecutions'. Anyone can see that if he forsakes his mother he is not going to receive mothers, nor likewise 
to receive brothers and sisters by forsaking these.

`Tamari nurui suae': quod significet Ecclesiam repraesentativam spiritualium et caelestium, quae `nurus' dicitur ex vero constat a repraesentatione `Tamaris' quod sit Ecclesia repraesentativa spiritualium 
et caelestium, de qua supra n. 4831; </p>
<p>et ex significatione `nurus' quod sit Ecclesiae spirituale seu verum; quod `nurus' in sensu interno id sit, est quia omnia quae conjugii et omnes qui ex 
conjugio erant, repraesentabant talia quae sunt conjugii caelestis, videatur supra n. 4637, proinde quae sunt boni et veri, nam haec sunt conjugii caelestis; inde est quod in Verbo `maritus' significet 
bonum et `uxor' verum, tum quod `filii et filiae' significent vera et bona quae ex illis; inde `nurus' quia uxor filii ut novi mariti, significat Ecclesiae verum conjunctum bono, et sic porro; 
sed significationes illae aliter se habent respective ad illos qui sunt ab Ecclesia caelesti, quam (o)ad illos qui sunt ab Ecclesia spirituali; in Ecclesia enim spirituali maritus vocatur `vir' 
et significat verum, ac uxor `mulier' et significat bonum, videatur supra n. 4823.  [2] Quod per `nurum' in sensu interno Verbi significetur Ecclesiae verum adjunctum ejus bono, consequenter in opposito sensu 
Ecclesiae falsum adjunctum ejus malo, constare etiam potest a locis (o)in Verbo ubi {1} nominatur, ut apud Hosheam,           Super capitibus montium sacrificant, et super      collibus 
suffiunt, sub quercu, et populo, et robore, quia      bona umbra ejus; propterea scortantur filiae vestrae, et      nurus vestrae adulterantur: nonne visitabo super filias      vestras quod scortentur 
et super nurus vestras quod      adulterentur? iv 13, 14; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de cultu mali et falsi, cultus mali significatur per `sacrificare super montium capitibus', et cultus falsi per `suffire super 
collibus'; vita mali significatur per quod `scortentur filiae', et doctrina falsi ex qua vita mali, per quod `nurus adulterentur'; quod adulteria et scortationes in Verbo significent adulterationes 
boni et falsificationes veri, videatur n. 2466, 2727, 3399; `nurus' itaque ibi pro affectionibus falsi: [3] apud Micham,           Magnus est loquens perversitatem animae suae, et      detorquet 
illam, bonus eorum sicut spina, rectus ut      dumus;... filius vilipendit patrem, filia insurgens      contra matrem suam, nurus contra socrum suam; hostes viri      domestici illius, vii [3,] 
4, 6; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de falso ex malo, in quo Ecclesia ultimo tempore cum vastata, in proximo sensu in quo Ecclesia Judaica; `filia insurgens contra matrem significat quod affectio mali contra verum; 
et nurus contra socrum' quod affectio falsi contra bonum. [4] Quia similiter se habet cum homine qui in tentationibus est, in his enim pugna est mali contra verum et falsi contra bonum, nam tentationes spirituales 
non aliud sunt quam vastationes falsi et mali apud hominem, idcirco tentationes seu pugnae spirituales paene per similia verba a Domino describuntur apud Matthaeum,           Jesus 
dixit, Ne existimate quod venerim ad mittendum      pacem super terram, non veni mittere pacem sed gladium,      veni enim ad dissidendum hominem contra patrem suum, et      filiam contra matrem 
suam, et nurum contra socrum suam,      et hostes homini: erunt domestici illius {2}, x 34-36,      38; </p>
<p>(m)similia haec verba apud Prophetam mox supra significarunt vastationem Ecclesiae, hic autem 
tentationes illorum qui ab Ecclesia, quia ut dictum, tentationes non aliud sunt quam vastationes seu remotiones {3} falsi et mali, quapropter etiam tam tentationes quam vastatione' significantur 
et describuntur per aquarum inundationes et {4} diluvia n. 705, 739, (x)756, 790;(n) hic itaque{5} `filia contra matrem' (o)etiam eo affectio mali contra verum, et `nurus contra socrum' affectio 
falsi contra bonum; </p>
<p>et quia mala et falsa apud hominem qui in tentatione intus sunt seu illius sunt, vocantur domestici, {6} dicitur `hostes hominis domestici ejus'; quod tentationes ita ibi describantur, 
patet ex eo quod dicatur quod `non venerit ad mittendum pacem (o)super terram sed gladium'; per `gladium' enim significatur verum pugnans; et in opposito sensu falsum pugnans, n. 2799, 4499, 
cum tamen venerit ad dandum pacem, {7} Joh. xiv 27; xvi 33; quod tentationes sint quae ita describuntur, constat {8} ex sequentibus ibi `quisquis non suscipit crucem suam {9}, et sequitur post Me, 
non est Me dignus': </p>
<p>[5] similiter apud Lucam,           Putatisne quod ad pacem venerim ad dandum in terra?       Non, dico vobis, sed divisionem; erunt namque ex nunc      quinque in domo una divisi, 
tres contra duos, et duo      contra tres, dividetur pater contra filium, et filius      contra patrem, mater contra filiam et filia contra      matrem, socrus contra nurum suam, et nurus contra 
socrum      suam, xii 51-53; </p>
<p>ex his quoque patet quod per `patrem, matrem, filium, filiam, nurum, socrum' significentur talia quae sunt ex conjugio caelesti, nempe bona et vera in suo ordine, 
et quoque opposita; sicut etiam apud Marcum,      Jesus dixit, Nemo est, qui derelinquit domum, aut fratres, aut      sorores, aut patrem, aut matrem, aut uxorem, aut liberos, aut      agros propter 
Me et Evangelium, si non recipiet centupla, nunc      in tempore hoc domos et fratres et sorores et matres et      liberos et agros cum persecutionibus, et in saeculo venturo      vitam aeternam, 
x 29, 30; </p>
<p>qui non sensum internum Verbi novit, credet quod per `domum, fratres, sorores, patrem, matrem, uxorem, liberos, agros' significentur domus, fratres, sorores, pater, mater, uxor, liberi, agri, 
sed sunt talia quae apud hominem sunt ei propria quae derelinquet, et loco eorum spiritualia et caelestia {10} quae Domini sunt quae recipiet, et hoc per tentationes, quae intelliguntur per 
persecutiones ibi; quisque videre potest quod si derelinquit matrem, non recepturus matres, similiter nec fratres, sorores.      @1 i nurus$      @2 i quisquis non suscipit crucem meam, et sequitur 
post Me, non est Me dignus$      @3 nempe$      @4 seu$      @5 ibi etiam$      @6 i et$      @7 i ut apud$      @8 i etiam$      @9 meam AI$      @10 i quae accepturus$ </p>
