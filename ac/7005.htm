<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7005节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7005.</strong>“我也要与你的口同在”表神性真理或神的真理将通过神性人身从神性本身发出。这从“摩西”的代表和“与他的口同在”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指神之真理方面的主，如前所述；“与他的口同在”是指在从神性人身发出的神之真理里面，“我”或耶和华表示被称为“父”的神性本身。由此明显可知，“我也要与你的口同在”表示神的真理通过神性人身从神性本身发出；按照教会的教义，这等于是说，圣灵的神圣从圣子发出，圣子从圣父发出。然而，要以这样的方式来理解：这三位一体在主里面，并且在祂里面为一。</p>

And I will be with thy mouth. That this signifies that truth Divine will proceed through the Divine Human from the Divine Itself, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to 
truth Divine (of which above); and from the signification of "being with his mouth," as being to be in the truth Divine which proceeds from the Divine Human. The Divine Itself, which is called the "Father," 
is meant by "I," or Jehovah. Hence it is evident that by "I will be with thy mouth" is signified that truth Divine proceeds through the Divine Human from the Divine Itself; which is the same as 
that the holy of the spirit proceeds from the Son, and the Son from the Father, according to the doctrine of the church; which however is to be understood in this way: that this Trine is in the Lord 
and is one in Him. </p>

'And I will be with your mouth' means that God's truth will go forth from the Divine itself by way of the Divine Human. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the Lord in respect of God's 
truth, dealt with already; and from the meaning of 'being with your mouth' as being within God's truth which goes forth from the Divine Human - the Divine itself, which is called the Father, being meant 
by 'I' or Jehovah. From this it is evident that 'I will be with your mouth' means that God's truth goes forth from the Divine itself by way of the Divine Human, which is the same as saying that the 
holiness of the Spirit proceeds from the Son, and the Son from the Father, as the Church teaches. But this should be taken to mean that that Trinity resides within the Lord and makes one there. </p>

`Et Ego ero cum ore tuo': quod significet quod verum Divinum procedet per Divinum Humanum ab Ipso Divino, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Dominus quoad verum Divinum, de qua prius; et 
ex significatione `esse cum ore tuo' quod sit inesse vero Divino quod a {1}Divino Humano procedit; Ipsum Divinum, quod `Pater' vocatur, intelligitur per `Ego' seu Jehovam; inde patet quod per `Ego ero 
cum ore tuo' significetur quod verum Divinum (x)procedat per Divinum Humanum ab Ipso Divino, quod idem est ac quod sanctum spiritus procedat a Filio, et quod Filius a Patre, secundum doctrinale Ecclesiae; 
quod tamen ita intelligendum {2} quod Trinum illud in Domino sit, et ibi unum. {3} 	@1 Domino$ 	@2 i et$ 	@3 After section concluded A adds et quod Dominus sit Trinum illud$ </p>
