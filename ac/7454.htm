<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7454.</strong>“这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的神”表地狱的肮脏和污秽会流入。这从“本不相宜”、“所厌恶的”和“祭祀耶和华神”的含义清楚可知：“本不相宜”是指某种不能做的事；“所厌恶的”是指地狱的肮脏和污秽；“祭祀耶和华神”是指敬拜他们的神，如前所述（<a href="7452.htm">7452</a>节）。因此，“把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华神”表示他们将以一种那些沉浸于虚假的人由于对抗这种敬拜并会侵扰它的地狱影响而所憎恶的敬拜来敬拜神。<br />至于这个问题到底是怎么回事，这从在来世清楚显现的事很明显地看出来。在那里，每个灵人，尤其每个社群都被这个灵人或社群的信仰和生命的一个气场包围。该气场是一种属灵气场，凭它就能知道这个灵人的性质，尤其知道这个社群的性质。因为那些拥有觉知的人有时在相当远的地方就能发觉这个气场。即便这个灵人或社群隐藏起来，没有通过思维或言语进行接触，他们也能发觉它。这种属灵气场好比包围世人肉体的物质气场，也就是由他身上所散发的气味构成，并能被嗅觉敏锐的动物闻到的一个气场。关于包围灵人的属灵气场，可参看前文（<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>，<a href="1519.htm">1519</a>，<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2489.htm">2489</a>，<a href="4464.htm">4464</a>，<a href="5179.htm">5179</a>，<a href="6206.htm">6206</a>e节）。<br />由此可见，地狱灵若出现在那些正在献上神性敬拜的人所在的地方附近，就会通过他们的气场侵扰他们；因为在这种情况下，那些正献上神性敬拜的人就会觉察到卑鄙可憎的东西。这一切表明当如何理解这个解释，即：如果他们在附近的地方敬拜神，地狱的污秽和肮脏就会流入。从关于每个灵人，尤其一个灵人社群所发出的属灵气场，或信仰和生命的气场的阐述也可以看出，凡人在世上所思、所言、所行的，都不是隐藏的，而是公开的；因为构成这个气场的，正是这些东西。这样一种气场也从一个在世上处于肉身之人的灵发出；从该气场也能知道他是哪种人。所以，不要以为人暗中所想、暗中所做的事是隐藏的。事实上，它们清清楚楚地显现在天上，如同显现在正午之光中，正如主在路加福音中所说的：<br />掩盖的事，没有不露出来的；隐藏的事，没有不被知道的。因此，你们在暗中所说的，将要在明处被听见；在内室附耳所说的，将要在房顶上被宣扬。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.2.htm">12:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.3.htm">3</a>）</p>

It is not meet to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God. That this signifies that infernal foulness and filthiness would flow in, is evident from the signification 
of "it is not meet to do so," as being that it cannot be so done; from the signification of "abomination," as being infernal foulness and filthiness; and from the signification of "sacrificing 
to Jehovah God," as being to worship their God (of which above, n. 7452). Hence by "sacrificing to Jehovah God the abomination of the Egyptians" is signified that they would worship God with a worship 
which those would abominate who are in falsities from what is infernal contrary to this worship, and which would infest it. [2] How the case stands with this matter is very evident from things that 
show themselves clearly in the other life. Every spirit, and still more every society, is surrounded with a sphere of the faith and of the life of that spirit or society. This sphere is a spiritual 
sphere, and by it is known the quality of the spirit, and even better that of the society. For the sphere is perceived by those who have perception, sometimes at a considerable distance; and this although 
the spirit or the society is in hiding, and does not communicate by thought or by speech. This spiritual sphere may be compared to the material sphere which encompasses the body of a man in the world, 
which is a sphere of effluvia exuding from him, and is smelled by keen-scented beasts. (Of the spiritual sphere which encompasses spirits, see n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504, 1519, 2401, 2489, 4464, 
5179, 6206.) [3] From all this it can be seen that if infernal spirits were near where they are who are in Divine worship, they would infest them by their sphere, for in this way they who are in Divine 
worship would perceive what is shocking and abominable. All this shows how it is to be understood that infernal foulness and filthiness would flow in, if they were to worship God in that neighborhood. 
From what has been said about the spiritual sphere, or the sphere of faith and life, which exhales from every spirit, and still more from a society of spirits, it can also be seen that nothing whatever 
is hidden of that which a man in the world has thought, spoken, and done, but that it is in the open; for it is these things which make this sphere. Such a sphere also pours forth from the spirit 
of a man while he is in the body in the world; and from this his quality is also known. Therefore believe not that the things a man thinks in secret and that he does in secret, are hidden, for they 
are as clearly shown in heaven as are those which appear in the light of noon, according to the Lord's words in Luke: </p>
<p>     There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; or hidden that shall not 
be known; therefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in bed-chambers, shall be proclaimed upon the housetops (Luke 12:2-3). </p>

'It is ill-advised to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God' means that what was vile, foul, and hellish would enter in. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'ill-advised to do so' as something that cannot be done; from the meaning of 'the abomination' as what is vile, foul, and hellish; and from the meaning of 'sacrificing to Jehovah God' as worshipping 
their God, dealt with above in <a href="7452.htm">7452</a>. Consequently 'sacrificing to Jehovah God the abomination of the Egyptians' means that they would be worshipping God with a type of worship which was abominated 
by those steeped in falsities because of a hellish influence that was antagonistic to that worship and would molest it. What all this entails is also evident from things that reveal themselves in the 
next life. Each spirit there, and especially each community, is encompassed by a sphere consisting of his or its own faith and life. This sphere is a spiritual sphere, and from it the character of the 
spirit is recognized, and especially that of the community; for those who have the gift of perception perceive it, sometimes from quite a long way off. They can perceive it even though they may be hidden 
from view and make no contact through thought or speech. This spiritual sphere may be compared to the material sphere which surrounds a person's body in the world. This sphere is a sphere consisting 
of odours emanating from him, and is detected by keen-scented animals. Regarding the spiritual sphere surrounding spirits, see <a href="1048.htm">1048</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="1504.htm">1504</a>, <a href="1519.htm">1519</a>, <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2489.htm">2489</a>, <a href="4464.htm">4464</a>, <a href="5179.htm">5179</a>, <a href="6206.htm">6206</a> (end). </p>

From all this it becomes clear that if hellish spirits were present near where people offering Divine worship were they would by means of their sphere molest those people; for in those circumstances 
those people offering Divine worship would perceive what was vile and abominable. This shows how one should understand the explanation that what was vile, foul, and hellish would enter in if they 
worshipped God in a place near them. From what has been stated about the spiritual sphere, or sphere consisting of faith and life, which emanates from each spirit, and especially from each community of 
spirits, it may also be recognized that nothing whatever of a person s thought, speech, or action in the world is hidden but is open to view, since they are what constitute that sphere. Such a sphere 
also emanates from a person's spirit while he is in the body, in the world. And from this too one knows what kind of person he is. Do not suppose therefore that the things which a person thinks in secret 
or does in secret are hidden. They are as plainly evident in heaven as things seen in the light of the midday sun, as accords with the Lord's words in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Nothing has been hidden that will 
not be revealed, or concealed that will not be made known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light; and what you have spoken in the ear in bedchambers will be proclaimed

`Non consultum facere ita, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificaremus Jehovae Deo nostro': quod significet quod influeret taetrum et spurcum infernale, constat ex significatione non consultum facere 
ita' quod sit non posse ita fieri; ex significatione `abominationis' quod sit taetrum et spurcum infernale; et ex significatione `sacrificare Jehovae Deo' quod sit colere Deum suum, de qua supra n. 
7452; inde per `sacrificare Jehovae Deo abominationem Aegyptiorum' significatur quod colerent Deum cultu quem abominarentur illi qui in falsis ex {1}infernali contra illum cultum, quod infestaret illum. 
 Quomodo cum hoc se habet, etiam patet ab illis quae se manifestant in altera vita: unusquisque spiritus, et magis unaquaevis societas, habet circum se sphaeram suae fidei et suae vitae, quae sphaera 
est sphaera spiritualis; ex illa dinoscitur spiritus, et magis societas, qualis sit, nam percipitur ab illis qui in perceptione sunt, quandoque ad (t)multam satis distantiam; et hoc {2}tametsi in 
occulto sunt, nec communicant per cogitationem aut per loquelam; sphaera haec spiritualis comparari potest sphaerae materiali quae circumdat corpus hominis in mundo; quae sphaera est sphaera effluviorum 
ab illo exundantium, et sentitur odoratu a bestiis sagacibus; de sphaera spirituali quae circumdat spiritus, videatur n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504, 1519, 2401, 2489, 4464, 5179, 6206 fin. 	2 Ex his 
constare potest quod si infernales spiritus prope adessent ubi illi qui in cultu Divino, quod per sphaeram suam infestarent illos, nam sic illi qui in cultu Divino perciperent taetrum et abominabile. 
 Ex his {3}sciri potest quomodo intelligendum quod influeret taetrum et spurcum infernale, si colerent Deum in propinquitate{4}.  Ex illis quae de sphaera spirituali, seu fidei et vitae, quae ab unoquovis 
spiritu, et magis quae a spirituum societate, exhalatur, etiam constare potest quod prorsus nihil occultum sit, sed in propatulo, quicquid homo in mundo cogitaverat, locutus est, et egerat, nam haec 
sunt quae sphaeram illam constituunt; talis sphaera etiam exundat ex spiritu hominis, quando is in corpore est in mundo; inde quoque cognoscitur {5} qualis est; ne itaque credatis quod quae cogitat 
homo in occulto, et quae agit in occulto, sint occulta; sunt illa tam manifesta in caelo, sicut {6}illa quae in luce medii diei apparent; secundum Domini verba apud Lucam, Nihil occultatum est quod 
non revelabitur, aut absconditum quod non cognoscetur; ideo quaecumque in tenebris dixeritis, in luce audientur; et quod in aurem locuti fueritis in cubiculis, praedicabitur super tectis, xii 2, 3. 	@1
