<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5689节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5689.</strong>“又说，我儿阿，愿神赐恩给你”表神性也与属天层的属灵层，就是居间层同在，因为它从属灵层的属天层，即源于神性的真理发出。这从“神赐恩”的含义清楚可知。当属灵层的属天层，即“约瑟”向属天层的属灵层，即“便雅悯”说这句话时，并且当后者也被前者称为“儿子”时，“神赐恩”表示神性也与属天层的属灵层，即居间层同在，因为居间层是从属灵层的属天层，即源于神性的真理发出的。“便雅悯”是指属天层的属灵层（参看<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>，<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>节）；他也是居间层（<a href="5411.htm">5411</a>，<a href="5413.htm">5413</a>，<a href="5443.htm">5443</a>，<a href="5639.htm">5639</a>节）。<br />由于如前所述，就至高意义而言，主的内在人是属灵层的属天层，该层就是源于神性的真理，或主里面神性本身的第一层衣服，并且由于属天层的属灵层，即居间层由此发出，故可知，神性也与这居间层同在。从某个事物发出之物皆从发出它之物获得其本质；但它会披上诸如服务于交流，因而服务于低层领域中的功用的那类遮盖物。包裹它的遮盖物部分源于诸如存在于这低层领域中的那类事物，以便发出它之物能通过诸如存在于那里的那类事物在低层领域进行运作。<br />提供其本质存在的，可以说它的父亲，因为本质存在是它的灵魂；提供其衣服的，是它的母亲，因为这衣服就是该灵魂的身体。这就是为何如前所述，居间层必须源于这二者，以便成为居间层；即必须源于如同其父亲的内在，和如同其母亲的外在；或也可说，它从内在所获得的东西如同它的父亲，从外在所获得的东西如同它的母亲。</p>

And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. That this signifies that the Divine was also with the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate, because it proceeds from the celestial of 
the spiritual, which is truth from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "God be gracious," when it is said by the celestial of the spiritual which is "Joseph," to the spiritual of the celestial 
which is "Benjamin," and when the latter is also called his "son," which means that the Divine is also with the spiritual of the celestial, which is an intermediate because it proceeds from the 
celestial of the spiritual which is truth from the Divine. (That "Benjamin" is the spiritual of the celestial may be seen above, n. 3969, 4592; and also that this is an intermediate, n. 5411, 5413, 5443, 
5639.)  [2] As in the supreme sense, as before said, the Lord's internal human was the celestial of the spiritual, and this was truth from the Divine, or the first clothing of the Divine Itself in 
the Lord, and as the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate, proceeded therefrom, it follows that the Divine was also with this. That which proceeds from anything derives its essence 
from that from which it proceeds; but it is clothed with such things as serve for communication, thus for use in a lower sphere. The things with which it is clothed are taken from such as are in the lower 
sphere, to the end that the internal from which it proceeds may act in the lower sphere by such means as are there. [3] That which gives the essence is as the father, for the essence is the soul; 
and that which gives the clothing is the mother, for the clothing is the body of this soul. This is the reason why it was said above that the intermediate must draw from both in order to be an intermediate; 
what it has from the internal being as its father, and what it has from the external being as its mother. </p>

'And he said, God be gracious to you, my son' means that the Divine was also present with the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediary, because it goes forth from the celestial of the spiritual, 
which is truth from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'God be gracious - when this is said by the celestial of the spiritual, which is 'Joseph', to the spiritual of the celestial, 
which is 'Benjamin', and when the latter is also addressed by the former as 'son' - as the Divine presence also with the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediary, because this goes forth 
from the celestial of the spiritual, which is truth from the Divine. For 'Benjamin' is the spiritual of the celestial, see <a href="3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="4592.htm">4592</a>; he is the intermediary too, <a href="5411.htm">5411</a>, <a href="5413.htm">5413</a>, <a href="5443.htm">5443</a>, <a href="5639.htm">5639</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since, 
as stated above, the Lord's inner man was the celestial of the spiritual, and this was truth from the Divine or the clothing next to the Divine Himself within the Lord, and since the spiritual of the 
celestial, which is the intermediary, went forth from that, it follows that the Divine was also present with this intermediary. What goes forth from something acquires its essential being from that 
from which it goes forth; but it is clothed with coverings such as serve to enable communication to take place and thereby enable a useful purpose to be realized in a lower sphere. The coverings that 
clothe it are derived in part from such things as exist in that lower sphere, to the end that the internal from which it goes forth can operate in the lower sphere through the kinds of things present 
there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What provides its essential being is so to speak its father, since that essential being is its soul; and what provides its clothing is its mother, for that clothing is the body belonging 
to this soul. This is why, as stated above, the intermediary must be derived from both if it is to be an intermediary - from the internal as its father and from the external as its  mother. </p>

`Et dixit, Deus gratiosus sit tibi, fili mi': quod significet quod Divinum etiam apud spirituale caelestis quod medium, quia procedit a caelesti spiritualis quod verum a Divino, constat ex significatione 
`Deus gratiosus esse' cum dicitur a caelesti spiritualis quod `Josephus', ad spirituale caelestis quod `Benjamin', et quoque cum vocatur `filius suus', quod sit Divinum etiam apud spirituale caelestis 
quod medium, quia procedit a caelesti spiritualis quod verum a Divino; quod `Benjamin' sit spirituale caelestis, videatur n. 3969, 4592, et quod sit medium, n. 5411, 5413, 5443, 5639.  [2]Quia 
in supremo sensu, ut supra dictum, internum humanum Domini fuit caeleste spiritualis, et hoc fuit verum a Divino, seu proximum indumentum Ipsius Divini in Domino, et quia spirituale caelestis quod medium, 
processit ab illo, sequitur quod etiam Divinum apud hoc esset; quod procedit ab aliquo, hoc trahit suam essentiam ab illo a quo procedit, sed induitur talibus quae inserviunt communicationi, ita 
usui in sphaera inferiore; illa quibus induitur, trahuntur a talibus quae in inferiore sphaera sunt, ob finem ut internum a quo procedit, agere possit in sphaera inferiore per talia quae ibi sunt; [3]quod 
{1} dat essentiam, est sicut `pater', nam essentia est anima; et quod dat indumentum est `mater', nam indumentum est {2}animae illius corpus; inde est quod supra dictum quod medium trahet ab utroque 
ut sit medium, {3}suum ab interno ut a patre, et {3}suum ab externo ut a matre. @1 i itaque$ @2 A o, I has anima illius$ @3 suum in A is added above line$ </p>
