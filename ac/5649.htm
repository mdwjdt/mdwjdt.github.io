<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5649节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5649.</strong>“说，我们被领到这地方，必是因为当初归还在我们口袋里的银子”表由于属世层中的真理看似白白赐予，所以它们正变得顺服。这从“归还的银子”、“口袋”和“被领到”的含义清楚可知：“归还的银子”是指白白赐予的真理（参看<a href="5530.htm">5530</a>，<a href="5624.htm">5624</a>节）；“口袋”是指外层属世层的门槛处或开口处（<a href="5497.htm">5497</a>节）；“被领到”是指被联结并变得顺服，如刚才所示（<a href="5648.htm">5648</a>节）。<br />此中情形是这样：由于察觉到外层属世层中记忆知识的真理已白白赐予，因而被引导与内在联结，而这会使他们服从它，所以如刚才所述，他们觉得会丧失自由，由此丧失生活的一切快乐。人完全不知道这一事实，即：据察觉，记忆知识的真理能白白赐予，并且这一切发生在属世层，要么发生在它的外层部分，要么发生在它的内层部分。他对此没有任何概念的原因在于，他没有像这样的任何觉知，因为他根本不知道白白赐予他的是什么，更不知道存储在外层属世层中的是什么，存储在内层属世层中的又是什么。他对此没有任何概念的常见原因是，他的心放在了世俗和尘世的事物上，而不是放在属天和属灵的事物上；因此，他不信任何经由天堂从主而来的流注，因而根本不信有什么东西会赐予他。而事实上，他利用基于记忆知识的推理所推断，并以为凭自己的理解力推断出来的一切真理都是某种赐予他的事物。人没有能力察觉这真理是存储在外层属世层，还是存储在内层属世层，因为他不知道属世层有两个部分，即：倾向并接近外在感官的外层部分，和退离外在感官并转向理性层的内层部分。<br />人对这些事一无所知，故根本不可能拥有关于这类观念的任何觉知；因为若要对一个事物有所觉知，对它的了解必须首先到来。然而，天使社群能准确、清楚地知道并察觉这些事。他们不仅知道并察觉白白赐予他们的是什么，而且还知道并察觉它在哪里，这从以下经历可以看出来。当有处于良善，因而拥有处于良善的能力的灵人进入一个天使社群时，他同时会进入该社群所拥有，并且他之前从未拥有过的一切记忆知识和聪明。这时，他只知道他早就拥有这种知识和理解，并是通过他自己拥有的。但当他停下来反思时，便发觉这是主通过这个天使社群白白赐予他的某种东西；他还从他所在的天使社群那里知道这真理是存在于外层属世层，还是存在于内层属世层。因为有些天使社群在外层属世层中，有些天使社群在内层属世层中。然而，属于他们的属世层却不像世人的属世层；确切地说，它是属灵的属世层，即通过与属灵层联结并服从它而变得属灵的属世层。<br />由此明显可知，此处提到的事在内在意义上描述了在来世实际发生的事。也就是说，来世的人十分清楚白白赐予他们的是什么，也十分清楚它存储在哪里，尽管如今世人对这类事一无所知。但在古时，那些属教会的人都知道这类事；他们的记忆知识和教义都会教导他们这类事。他们是内层人；但自从那时起，人们逐渐变得越来越外在，以致现在他们活在肉体中，因而活在最外在的东西中。这种迹象可见于以下事实：人们甚至不知道何为属灵层，或何为内在，也不相信它们的存在。事实上，他们已经远离内层事物，进入肉体里面的最外层，以致他们甚至不相信死后生命的存在，也不相信天堂或地狱的存在。他们因远离内层事物，进入了最外层，故在属灵的事上变得如此愚蠢，以至于认为人的生命就像野兽的生命，因此人会像野兽那样死去。说来奇怪，有学问的人比简单人更相信这类事；凡有不同信仰的人都被他们视为傻瓜。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5649</b></p><p><b>5649.</b>
And they said, Over the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought. That this signifies that because truth in the exterior natural appears to be given gratuitously, 
they were therefore to be in subjection, is evident from the signification of the "silver being returned," as being truth bestowed gratuitously, (see n. 5530, 5624); from the signification of a "bag," 
as being the threshold of the exterior natural (n. 5497); and from the signification of "being brought," as being to be adjoined or subjected (as shown just above, n. 5648).  [2] The case herein 
is this. As it was perceived that the truths of memory-knowledge in the exterior natural were given gratuitously, and would therefore be enticed to conjoin themselves with the internal, and thereby be 
in subjection to it, they would as just said be deprived of their freedom, and thereby of all the delight of life. That this is the case, namely, that it is perceived that truths of memory-knowledge 
are bestowed gratuitously, and this in the natural mind whether exterior or interior, is quite unknown to man. The reason is that he is in no such perception; for he does not at all know what is bestowed 
on him gratuitously, still less what is stored up in the exterior natural, and what in the interior. The reason why he has not this perception is usually because worldly and earthly things are dear 
to him, and not celestial and spiritual things; and therefore he does not believe in any influx through heaven from the Lord, thus not at all that anything is given him; when yet all the truth that 
he rationally infers from memory-knowledges, and supposes to be of his own ability, is such as is given him. Still less can man perceive whether it is placed in the exterior natural or in the interior, 
because he is ignorant that the natural is twofold, namely the outer which draws near to the external senses, and the inner which draws back from them and turns to the rational. [3] As man knows nothing 
about either the one or the other, he can therefore have no perception about such things; for the knowledge of a thing must come first in order that there may be a perception of it. Yet the angelic 
societies know and perceive these things well and clearly, not only what is bestowed on them gratuitously, but also where it is, as may be seen from the following experience. When any spirit who 
is in good, and hence in ability, comes into an angelic society, he comes at the same time into all the memory-knowledge and intelligence the society has, and in which he had not been before; and he then 
knows no otherwise than that he had known and understood it so before, and from himself. But when he reflects, he perceives that it is gratuitously bestowed on him through that angelic society by 
the Lord; and he also knows from the angelic society where it is, whether in the exterior or in the interior natural. For there are angelic societies that are in the exterior natural, and there are others 
that are in the interior natural. Yet the natural which belongs to them is not such a natural as man has; but it is a spiritual natural, which has become spiritual by having been conjoined and subjected 
to the spiritual.  [4] From all this it is evident that the things here related in the internal sense take place actually so in the other life, namely, that they perceive what is given them gratuitously, 
as well as where it is stored up, although man at this day knows nothing of such things. But in ancient times they who were of the church knew such things, being taught them by their memory-knowledges 
and by their doctrinals. They were interior men; but since those times men have become successively more external, insomuch that at this day they are in the body, thus in the outermost. 
A sign of this is that they do not even know what the spiritual and the internal are, nor believe in their existence. Nay, to such an outermost in the body have they gone away from interior things, that 
they do not even believe that there is a life after death, nor that there is a heaven or a hell. Nay, by receding from interior things they have gone to such an outermost, and have become so stupid 
in spiritual things, as to believe that man's life is like that of beasts, and therefore that man will die in like manner; and strange to say the learned believe so more than the simple, and anyone who 
believes differently is accounted by them a simpleton. </p>

'And they said, Over the matter of the silver put back in our  pouches [at the beginning] are we brought to [this place]' means that because truth in the exterior natural appears to be something freely 
given, they were being made subservient. This is clear from the meaning of 'the silver put back' as truth freely given, dealt with in <a href="5530.htm">5530</a>, <a href="5624.htm">5624</a>; from the meaning of 'the pouch' as the opening to the 
exterior natural, dealt with in <a href="5497.htm">5497</a>; and from the meaning of 'brought to' as being linked and made subservient to, dealt with immediately above in <a href="5648.htm">5648</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of all this are as 
follows: Because it had been perceived that the facts present in the exterior man which held truths within them had been freely given and were therefore being led on to become joined to the internal, 
which would make them subservient to it, it was consequently perceived that, as stated just above, they would be deprived of their freedom and so of all the delight that life holds within itself. But 
man has no conception of such a thing, that is to say, of its being perceived that facts holding truths within them can be given freely and that this happens in the natural, in either the exterior part 
or the interior part of it. The reason he has no conception of this is that he does not enjoy any kind of perception like that, for he does not have the vaguest idea about what is given to him freely, 
let alone about what is stored away in the exterior natural and what in the interior natural. The common reason why he does not have any perception of this is that his heart is set on worldly and earthly 
things, not on celestial and spiritual ones, and therefore he has no belief in any influence coming from the Lord by way of heaven and so no belief whatever in the gift of any such things to him. 
Yet in actual fact all the truth which he arrives at by the use of reason based on factual knowledge and which he imagines he arrives at by his own power of understanding is something that is given 
to him. And man has even less ability to perceive whether that truth is stored away in the exterior natural or in the interior natural, because he is ignorant of the fact that the natural has two parts, 
namely an exterior part which leans towards the external senses and an interior part which leans away from these and turns towards the rational.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since man has no knowledge of any of these 
matters he cannot have any perception at all regarding such ideas; for acquaintance with a reality must come first if there is to be any perception about it. But angelic communities are properly acquainted 
with and have a right perception of those matters. They are acquainted with and perceive not only what is given them freely but also in what place this exists, as the following experience makes 
clear: When any spirit who is moved by good, and therefore has the ability to do so, enters some angelic community, he enters at the same time into all the knowledge and intelligence belonging to this 
community, which he had not possessed before. At such a time he is not aware of anything different from this - that he was already in possession of such knowledge and understanding, and through his own 
deliberation But when he stops to reflect he realizes that it is something freely given him by the Lord through that angelic community He also knows, from the angelic community where he is, whether 
that truth exists in the exterior natural or in the interior natural; for there are angelic communities situated in the exterior natural, and there are those situated in the interior natural. But their 
natural is not like man's natural; rather it is a natural that is spiritual - one that has been made spiritual by having become joined and made subservient to the spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this one 
may see that the matters mentioned here in the internal sense describe what actually happens in the next life. That is to say, those there are quite aware of what is freely given them and also of where 
it is stored away, even though man at the present day knows nothing at all about such matters. In ancient times however those who belonged to the Church did know about them; their factual knowledge 
told them about such matters, and so did their religious teachings. They were people of a more internal frame of mind; but since those times people have become progressively more externally minded, 
so much so that at the present day they live in the body, thus in what is the most external. A sign of this is seen in the fact that people do not even know what the spiritual is or what the internal 
is; and they do not believe even in the existence of such realities. Indeed people have moved so far away from things on a more internal level to what is most external within the body that they do not 
even believe in the reality of a life after death, or in the existence of heaven or hell. Indeed because of their departure from things of a more internal level into what is most external they have become 
so stupid. So far as spiritual realities are concerned, as to believe that man's life is similar to that of beasts, so that in death man is no different from them. And what is so surprising, the 
learned believe these kinds of things more than the simple; and anyone whose belief is different from theirs is thought by them to be a simpleton. </p>

`Et dixerunt, Super verbum argenti reducti in manticis nostris (x)in initio nos adducimur': quod significet quia verum in exteriore naturali apparet gratis donatum, quod ideo subjicerentur,  constat 
ex significatione `argenti reducti' quod sit verum gratis donatum, de qua n. 5530, 5624; ex significatione `manticae' quod sit limen naturalis exterioris, de qua n. 5497; et ex significatione `adduci' 
quod sit adjungi et subjici, de qua mox supra n. 5648.  [2]Hoc ita se  habet: quia perceptum quod vera scientifica in exteriore naturali essent gratis donata, et ideo allicerentur ad conjungendum 
se interno, et sic ei subjicerentur, inde, ut mox supra dictum, (t)privarentur suo libero et sic omni jucundo vitae; quod ita sit, nempe quod percipiatur quod vera scientifica gratis donata sint, et id 
in naturali vel exteriore vel interiore est prorsus ignotum homini; causa est quia is in nulla tali perceptione est, ne hilum enim scit quid ei gratis donatur, minus quid in naturali exteriore, et quid 
in interiore reponitur; quod id non percipiat, communis causa est quod mundana et terrestria ei cordi sint, non autem caelestia et spiritualia, et quod ideo non credat aliquem influxum per caelum 
a Domino, ita nequaquam quod aliquid ei donetur; cum tamen omne id verum quod {1}rationaliter concludit ex scientificis, et putat quod ex propria potentia, sit tale quod ei donatur; minus potest homo 
percipere num id positum sit in exteriore naturali vel in interiore, quia ignorat quod naturale sit binum, nempe exterius quod accedit ad sensus externos, et interius quod recedit ab illis et convertit 
se ad rationale; [3]quia homo in ignorantia est de his et illis, idcirco nihil perceptionis habere potest de talibus; cognitio rei praecedet ut sit {2}ejus perceptio; at societates angelicae haec probe 
et clare sciunt et percipiunt, non modo quid illis gratis donatur sed etiam ubinam id est; quod constare potest ab hac experientia: cum aliquis spiritus qui in bono est et inde in facultate, in societatem 
angelicam venit, tunc is simul venit in omnem scientiam et intelligentiam quae societati est, in qua non prius fuerat, et tunc non aliter scit quam quod sciverit id et (x)intellexerit ita prius 
et a se; at cum reflectit, appercipit quod id ei per societatem illam angelicam a Domino gratis donetur; et quoque scit, ex societate angelica ubinam est, num id in naturali exteriore aut in naturali 
interiore sit; sunt enim societates angelicae quae in exteriore naturali, et sunt quae in  interiore; at naturale non (t)illis est naturale quale {3} homini, sed est naturale spirituale, quod spirituale 
factum est per id quod conjunctum et subjectum sit spirituali.  [4]Ex his constare potest quod quae hic in sensu interno {4}memorantur, actualiter ita existant in altera vita, quod nempe appercipiant 
quid illis gratis donatur, tum ubinam id reponitur, tametsi homo hodie nihil de talibus sciat; at in antiquis temporibus illi qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia, talia sciverunt, scientifica  eorum docebant, 
et quoque doctrinalia; {5}fuerunt illi interiores homines, sed ab illis temporibus (t)homines successive facti sunt exteriores, usque adeo ut hodie in corpore sint, ita in extremo; cujus rei indicium 
est quod ne quidem sciant quid spirituale et quid internum, et quod nec credant quod sint; immo ad tale extremum in corpore ab interioribus abiverunt ut ne quidem credant quod vita sit post mortem, 
nec quod caelum nec infernum; immo ex recessione ab interioribus usque in tale extremum, tam stupidi in spiritualibus facti sunt ut credant vitam hominis similem esse vitae {6}bestiarum, et sic hominem 
similiter moriturum; et quod mirabile, tale credunt eruditi prae simplicibus, et qui aliter credit, pro simplici ab illis habetur. @1 after scientificis$ @2 A d ejus$ @3 i est$ @4 continentur$ @5
