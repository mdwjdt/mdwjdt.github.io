<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8972节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8972.</strong>出埃及记21:1.你在他们面前所要立的典章是这些表那些外层真理，就是诸如在有一个代表性教会所在之地以一种文明的状态存在，并从属于天上秩序的内在真理流出的那种真理。“在他们面前所要立的典章”表示这些事，这一点从“典章”的含义清楚可知，“典章”是指真理（参看<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>，<a href="7206.htm">7206</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8695.htm">8695</a>节）。“典章”（judgments）之所以指真理，是因为一切审判都是通过真理实现的；故在圣言中，“施行审判”表示实行真理，也就是根据真理审判。但复数形式的“典章”表示文明的法律，因而表示诸如以一种文明的状态存在的那种外层真理。之所以“在有一个代表性教会所在之地”，是因为这些真理容纳并包含了那些属于天上秩序的真理在自己里面，这从它们的内义可以看出来。<br />主给以色列人所制定并吩咐他们遵守的律法，分为诫命、典章和律例。属于生命的律法被称为“诫命”；属于文明状态的律法被称为“典章”；属于敬拜的律法被称为“律例”。至于具体的“典章”，它们是诸如本章和随后几章所包含的那类律法。它们是为一个其中天堂和教会的内在事物由外在事物来代表的教会里的律法服务的；而不是为一个像基督教会那样其中内在事物不再由外在事物来代表的教会里的律法服务。这是因为内在事物已经向该教会的人们揭示了，因此与天堂的交流是通过内在事物，而不是像以前那样通过外在事物实现的。这就是基督教会成员不必遵守外在要求被，即所谓的“典章”和“律例”，只遵守内在要求的原因。尽管如此，神圣仍保留在它们里面，因为它们包含神圣真理在里面，就像圣言中关于祭祀的每一个命令一样。这些东西尽管已经废除，但因包含在它们里面并由它们来代表的神性事物而仍为圣言的神圣事物。因为当一个基督徒读到它们时，在它们里面并由它们所代表的神性事物就在天上被感知到，并以神圣之物充满天使，同时还通过来自天使的流注充满读者本人，尤其当读者自己同时也在思想它们里面的神性事物的时候。由此明显可知，甚至连旧约圣言也是最为神圣的。<br />主所制定并吩咐以色列人遵守的律法分为涉及生命的“诫命”，涉及文明状态的“典章”和涉及敬拜的“律例”，这一点明显可见于摩西五经：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你去对他们说：你们回帐棚去吧！至于你，可以站在我这里，我要将你所应当教训他们的一切诫命、律例、典章都对你讲说，使他们遵行。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.28.htm">5:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.31.htm">31</a>）<br />申命记：<br />这些是耶和华你们的神所吩咐教训你们的诫命、律例、典章。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.1.htm">6:1</a>）<br /><br />所以，你要谨守我今日所吩咐你的诫命、律例、典章，遵行它们。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.11.htm">7:11</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />倘若他的子孙离弃我的律法，不行在我的典章中；亵渎我的律例，不遵守我的诫命，我就要用杖责罚他们的过犯。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.30.htm">89:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.32.htm">32</a>）<br />此外，一切律法，只要属于代表性教会，一般被称为“典章”和“律例”，如摩西五经：<br />以色列人哪，现在你们要听从我所教训你们的律例典章，遵行它们。又哪一大民族有这样公义的律例典章，像我今日在你们面前所立的这一切律法呢？（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.1.htm">4:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.1.htm">5:1</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />耶路撒冷将我的典章变成邪恶，过于列族；干犯我的律例，过于她四围的列地。因为他们弃掉我的典章，没有行在我的律例中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.6.htm">5:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.7.htm">7</a>）<br /><br />要让他们行在我的律例中，谨守我的典章，按诚实行事。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结18.9.htm">18:9</a>）<br />此外还有其它许多地方（如利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.5.htm">18:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.37.htm">19:37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.22.htm">20:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.18.htm">25:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.15.htm">26:15</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.17.htm">26:17</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.12.htm">11:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.11.htm">20:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.25.htm">25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.24.htm">37:24</a>）。</p>

Verse 1. And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them, signifies exterior truths, such as there must be in the civil state where there is a representative church, and which flow from 
the internal truths which are of order in the heavens. That these things are signified by "the judgments which were to be set before the sons of Israel" is evident from the signification of "judgments," 
as being truths (see n. 2235, 6397, 7206, 8685, 8695). The reason why "judgments" denote truths is that all judgment is effected by means of truths; consequently by "doing judgment" in the Word is 
signified doing truth, that is, judging according to truths. But by "judgments," in the plural, are signified civil laws, thus exterior truths such as are in the civil state. It is said "where there is 
a representative church," for the reason that interiorly they contain and involve in them those truths which are of order in the heavens, as can be seen from their internal sense. [2] The laws which 
were enacted and commanded the sons of Israel by the Lord were distinguished into "commandments," "judgments," and "statutes." Those were called "commandments" which belonged to life; those "judgments" 
which belonged to the civil state; and those "statutes" which belonged to worship. As regards "judgments" specifically, they are such things as are contained in this chapter, and also in several chapters 
that follow. They served for laws in a church wherein the internal things which are of heaven and the church were represented by external things. But they do not serve for laws in a church wherein 
internal things are no longer represented by external, as in the Christian Church. The reason is that to the man of this Church internal things have been revealed, and therefore communication with 
heaven is effected by means of internal things, and not by means of external things, as before. This is the reason why the man of the Christian Church is not bound to observe in their external form 
those things which are called "judgments" and "statutes," but in their internal form. Nevertheless holiness abides in them, because they contain holy things within them, as do also all and each of the 
things commanded in the Word about sacrifices. Although these things have been abrogated, they nevertheless are holy things of the Word by reason of the Divine things which are in them, and which they 
represented. For when they are read by a Christian man, the Divine things that are within them, and that were represented, are perceived in the heavens, and fill the angels with that which is holy, 
and at the same time by influx from the angels they fill the man who reads, especially if he himself then thinks of the Divine things that are within them. From this it is plain that the Word even of 
the Old Testament is most holy. [3] That the laws enacted by the Lord and commanded the sons of Israel were distinguished into "commandments" which relate to life, into "judgments" which relate to the 
civil state, and into "statutes" which relate to worship, is plain in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Moses, Go, say to them, return ye into your tents. But as for thee, stand thou here 
with Me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them (Deut. 5:28, 30, 31).      Now these are the commandments, 
the statutes, and the judgments, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you (Deut. 6:1).      Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command 
thee this day, to do them (Deut. 7:11).      If his sons forsake My law, and walk not In My judgments; if they profane My statutes, and keep not My commandments; I will visit their transgression 
with the rod (Ps. 89:30-32). [4] Moreover all the laws, insofar as they belonged to the representative church, were in general called "judgments" and "statutes," as in Moses: </p>
<p>     Now, therefore, O 
Israel, hear the statutes and the judgments which I will teach you, that ye may do them. What great nation is there that hath statutes and judgments so just as all this law, which I will give before 
you this day? (Deut. 4:1, 8; 5:1).      Jerusalem hath changed My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and My statutes more than the lands that are round about her; for they have rejected 
My judgments, and have not walked in My statutes (Ezek. 5:6, 7).      Let them walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, to do the truth (Ezek. 18:9). Besides many other places (as Lev. 18:5; 19:37; 
20:22; 25:18; 26:15; Deut. 26:17; Ezek. 11:12, 20; 20:11, 13, 25; 37:24). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8972</b></p><p><b>8972.</b>
Verse 1 And these are the judgements which you shall set before them means those more external truths such as must exist in a civic state where the Church is representative, which flow from the internal 
truths belonging to order in heaven. The fact that these things are meant by 'the judgements that were to be set before the children of Israel' is clear from the meaning of 'judgements' as truths, 
dealt with in <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>, <a href="7206.htm">7206</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8695.htm">8695</a>. The reason why 'judgements' are truths is that all judgement is effected by means of truths; therefore 'executing judgement' in the Word means executing truth, 
that is, judging in accordance with truths. But the plural 'judgements' means civil laws, thus those more external truths such as exist in a civic state. The words 'where the Church is representative' 
are added because these truths contain and embody within themselves the truths that belong to order in heaven, as may be recognized from the internal sense of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The laws which the Lord 
delivered to the children of Israel and commanded them to keep were divided into commandments, judgements, and statutes. The term 'commandments' was given to those which were laws of life, 'judgements' 
to those which were laws of the civic state, and 'statutes' to those which were laws of worship. As regards judgements specifically, they are the kinds of laws that are contained in the present chapter 
and also some that follow. They served as laws in a Church in which inner realities, those of heaven and of the Church, were represented by outward things; but they do not serve as laws in a Church 
in which inner realities are no longer represented by outward things, as in the Christian Church. The reason for this is that inner realities have been revealed to people of this Church, and therefore 
inner realities are the channel through which contact is made with heaven, not outward things, as had been the situation before the Christian Church. Here is the reason why members of the Christian 
Church are not bound to adhere to the outward requirements of the laws called judgements and statutes, only to the inward ones. Holiness still remains within them because they hold holy truths within 
them, as also does every single command in the Word regarding the sacrifices. Although these are no longer prescriptive laws they remain holy constituents of the Word because of the Divine realities 
which they hold within themselves and which they represented. For when they are read by a Christian the Divine realities which are held within them and which were represented by them are discerned in 
heaven. They fill the angels with holiness, and at the same time the reader too through influx from the angels, especially if the reader himself is thinking at the same time about the Divine realities 
within them. From this it is evident that even the Old Testament Word is extremely holy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the laws which the Lord delivered to the children of Israel and commanded them to keep 
were divided into commandments that were laws of life, judgements that were laws of the civic state, and statutes that were laws of worship, is evident in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, Go, say to them, 
Go back into your tents. But you, stand here with Me, that I may tell you all the commandments, and statutes, and judgements which you shall teach them, so that they may do them <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%205:30,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 5:30, 31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Furthermore these are the commandments, statutes, and judgements which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%206:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 6:1</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore you shall keep the 
commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
If his sons forsake My law and do not walk in My judgements, if they profane 
My statutes and do not keep My commandments, I will visit their transgression with the rod. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2089:30-32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 89:30-32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Furthermore all the laws, in that they were those of a representative Church, were generally 
called judgements and statutes, as in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Now therefore, O Israel, hear the statutes and the judgements which I will teach you, that you may do them. What great nation [is there] that has 
righteous statutes and judgements, like all this law which I will set before you today? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:1,%208;%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:1, 8; 5:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel. </p>
<blockquote>
Jerusalem has changed My judgements into wickedness mom than the nations, and 
My statutes more than the lands that are around her; for they have repudiated My judgements, and have not walked in My statutes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%205:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 5:6, 7</a>.

<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Let him<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> walk in My statutes

<blockquote>
In addition to these there are many other places, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2018:5;%2019:37;%2020:22;%2025:18;%2026:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 18:5; 19:37; 20:22; 25:18; 26:15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2026:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 26:17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2011:12,%2020;%2020:11,%2013,%2025;%2037:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 11:12, 20; 20:11, 13, 25; 37:24</a>.

Vers. I.  Et haec judicia quae pones coram illis significat vera exteriora, qualia erunt in statu civili ubi Ecclesia repraesentativa quae fluunt ex veris internis quae sunt ordinis in caelis; quod 
haec significentur per `judicia quae ponerentur coram filiis Israelis,' constat ex significatione `judiciorum' quos sint vera, de qua n. 2235, 6397, 7206, 8685, 8695.  Quod `judicia' sint vera, est quia 
omne judicium fit per vera, inde per `facere judicium' in (x)Verbo significatur facere verum, hoc est, judicare secundum vera.  At per judicia in plurali significantur leges civiles, ita vera exteriora 
qualia sunt in statu civili; ubi Ecclesia repraesentativa, dicitur ex causa quia interius in se {2} continent et involvunt (x)illa vera quae sunt ordinis in caelis, prout constare potest a sensu 
interno illorum. 	2 Leges quae a Domino latae et mandatae sunt filiis Israelis, distinguebantur in praecepta, judicia, et statuta; praecepta dicebantur quae erant vitae, judicia quae erant status civilis, 
et statuta quae erant cultus.  Quod judicia in specie attinet, sunt talia quae continentur in hoc capite et quoque in aliquibus sequentibus; serviverant illa pro legibus in Ecclesia ubi interna, 
quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae, per externa repraesentabantur, non autem serviunt pro legibus in Ecclesia ubi interna per externa non amplius repraesentantur, ut in Ecclesia Christiana; causa est quia 
homini hujus Ecclesiae interna revelata sunt, et ideo per interna fit communicatio cum caelo, non autem per externa, ut prius; ea causa est quod homo Ecclesiae Christianae non teneatur observare illa 
quae judicia et statuta vocantur in externa forma, sed in interna; sanctitas usque illis manet, quia in se continent sancta, sicut etiam omnibus et singulis in (x)Verbo quae de sacrificiis mandata sunt; 
haec tametsi abrogata sunt, usque sancta (x)Verbi sunt ex Divinis quae in illis et quae {3}repraesentabant, nam cum leguntur ab homine Christiano, Divina quae in illis, et quae {4}repraesentabantur, 
appercipiuntur in caelis, ac implent angelos sancto, et tunc simul hominem qui legit per influxum ab angelis, et magis si ipse homo tunc simul cogitat de Divinis quae in illis; inde patet quod Verbum 
etiam Veteris Testamenti sanctissimum sit. 	3 Quod leges a Domino latae (c)et mandatae filiis Israelis distinctae fuerint in praecepta quae vitae, in judicia quae status civilis, et in statuta quae 
cultus, patet apud Moschen, 	Jehovah dixit ad Moschen, Abi, dic illis, Redite vobis in tentoria vestra; tu autem hic sta Mecum ut loquar ad te omnia praecepta, et statuta, et judicia, quae docebis eos, 
ut faciant ea Deut. v [27,] 28 [A.V. 30, 31]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ceterum {5}haec sunt praecepta, statuta, et judicia, qua praecepit Jehovah Deus vester ad docendum vos, Deut. vi 1: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ideo 
custodies {6}praecepta et statuta et judicia, quae Ego praecipiens tibi hodie ad faciendum ea, Deut. vii II: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Si (x)deserent filii ejus legem Meam, et in judiciis Meis non ambulant, 
si statuta Mea profanant, et praecepta Mea non servant: visitabo virga praevaricationem eorum, Ps. lxxxix 31-33 [A.V. 30-32]. 	4 Praeterea omnes leges, quatenus Ecclesiae repraesentativae erant, in 
genere vocabantur judicia et statuta, ut apud Moschen, 	(x)Jam ergo, Israel, audi statuta et judicia quae Ego docturus vos ut faciatis. Quae gens magna, cui statuta et judicia justa, sicut omnis lex 
haec quam Ego daturus coram vobis hodie? Deut. iv I, [8,] vI: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Hierosolyma mutavit judicia Mea in impietatem prae gentibus, et statuta Mea prae terris quae circum eam, nam judicia Mea 
repudiarunt, et in statutis Meis non ambularunt, v 6, 7: </p>
