<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7337.</strong>“埃及的术士，也用邪术这样行了”表他们当中的歪曲者通过滥用秩序制造了某种看似一样的东西。这从“埃及的术士”和“邪术”的含义清楚可知：“埃及的术士”和“邪术”是指对神性秩序的滥用（参看<a href="5223.htm">5223</a>，<a href="6052.htm">6052</a>，<a href="7296.htm">7296</a>节）。至于奇迹，要知道，神性的奇迹（以下简称神迹）不同于涉及巫术的奇迹，犹如天堂不同于地狱。神迹从神性真理发出，并照真正的秩序发展；在最低层的效果就是奇迹，前提是主乐意它们以这种形式来呈现。正因如此，一切神迹皆代表主在天上的国度，以及祂在地上的国度，也就是教会的状态。这就是神迹的内在形式。在埃及所行的一切神迹，以及圣言中提到的其它一切神迹都是这种情况。主在世时亲自所行的一切神迹都表示教会未来的状态。例如，开瞎子的眼、聋子的耳、解开哑巴的舌结，使瘸子行走，使残疾的和长大麻疯的痊愈，就表示瞎子、聋子、哑巴、残疾的和长大麻疯的所代表的那种人将接受福音，恢复属灵的健康，而这一切通过主降世实现。这就是神迹在其内在形式上的样子。<br />但涉及巫术的奇迹根本不是这样；恶人行这些奇迹是为了获得对他人的权柄；然而，这些奇迹在外在形式上看似神迹；这是因为它们始于秩序，从秩序流出，秩序在奇迹所呈现的最低层看似一样；正因如此，在秩序的最末和最低层的真理拥有能力在自己里面，所以恶人利用真理获得能力并掌控他人。<br />举个例子。按照秩序，在来世，情感和思维的状态会给人带来位置和距离的观念；看似将人们彼此分开的距离取决于他们在状态上的不同。这种秩序就来自神性，旨在让大人里面的所有人都能彼此有别。但来世的巫师滥用这种秩序，因为他们在其他人身上引发状态的变化，以这种方式时而把他们移到高处，时而把他们移到低处，还强迫他们进入他们能作为使臣服务于他们的社群。他们以其它无数种类似方式滥用秩序。由此明显可知，尽管就外在形式而言，涉及巫术的奇迹似乎与神迹一样；然而，它们内在却有一个相反的目的。也就是说，它们以摧毁教会事物为目的；而神迹内在却有建立教会事物的目的。此中情形就像两个美丽的女人，其中一个由于淫乱，内在已完全腐烂了，而另一个由于贞洁或真正的婚姻之爱，内在是完全纯洁的。她们在表面形式上很相似，但在内在形式上就像天堂和地狱那样不同。</p>

And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments. That this signifies that their falsifiers fashioned the like, is evident from the signification of the Egyptian magic and enchantments, as being 
abuses of Divine order (see n. 5223, 6052, 7296). As regards miracles, be it known that Divine miracles differ from magical miracles as heaven does from hell. Divine miracles proceed from Divine 
truth and advance according to order, the effects in ultimates being miracles when it pleases the Lord that they be presented in this form. Hence it is that all Divine miracles represent states of the 
Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and of the Lord's kingdom in the earth, that is, of the church. This is the internal form of Divine miracles. Such is the case with all the miracles done in Egypt, and 
also with all others that are mentioned in the Word. All miracles which the Lord Himself wrought when He was in the world signified the coming state of the church; thus that the eyes of the blind were 
opened and the ears of the deaf, that the tongues of the dumb were loosed, that the lame walked, and the maimed and also the lepers were healed, signified that such men as are represented by the blind, 
deaf, dumb, lame, maimed, and leprous, would receive the gospel and be spiritually healed, and this through the coming of the Lord into the world. Such are Divine miracles in their internal form. [2] 
But magical miracles involve nothing at all, being wrought by the evil to acquire power over others; yet they appear in the external form like Divine miracles, and this for the reason that they flow 
from order, and order appears alike in the ultimates where miracles are presented. For example: the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord has in it all power, and hence it is that even in truths in 
the ultimates of order there is power; and therefore the evil acquire power and rule over others by means of truths. [3] Take also as an example the fact that in the other life it is according to order 
that states of affection and thought cause the idea of place and distance; and that the inhabitants appear distant from one another, so far as they are in a diverse state. This order is from the Divine, 
to the intent that all who are in the Grand Man may be distinct from one another. Magicians in the other life abuse this order, for they induce on others changes of state, and in this way at one 
time transport them on high, and at another into the deep, and also cast them into societies where they may serve them as subjects; and so in countless other ways. From all this it is evident that magical 
miracles, although in outward form similar to Divine miracles, nevertheless have within them a contrary end, namely, that of destroying the things of the church; whereas Divine miracles have within 
them the end of building up the things of the church. The case herein is like that of two beautiful women, one of whom is inwardly wholly rotten from whoredom, and the other absolutely pure within 
from chastity or genuine conjugial love. Their outward forms are alike, but their inward forms differ as do heaven and hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7337</b></p><p><b>7337.</b>
'And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their enchantments' means that [by a misuse of order] the falsifiers among them produced something that looked the same. This is clear from the meaning of 
'Egyptian magic' and 'enchantments' as misuses of Divine order, dealt with in <a href="5223.htm">5223</a>, <a href="6052.htm">6052</a>, <a href="7296.htm">7296</a>. As regards miracles, it should be recognized that Divine miracles are as different from miracles involving 
the use of magic as heaven is from hell. Divine miracles spring from Divine Truth and take place in accordance with true order. Effects on lowest levels are miracles when it pleases the Lord that 
they should present themselves in that form. Thus it is that all Divine miracles represent states of the Lord's kingdom in heaven, and of the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the Church. And this is 
the inward form that Divine miracles take. This is the situation with all the miracles performed in Egypt, as it is with all the rest that are referred to in the Word. All the miracles too which the 
Lord Himself performed when He was in the world were signs of the future state of the Church. Opening the eyes of the blind, for example, and the ears of the deaf, loosing the tongues of the dumb, enabling 
the lame to walk, and making the maimed whole and the leprous too, were signs that the kind of people meant by the blind, deaf, dumb, lame, maimed, and leprous would receive the Gospel and be spiritually 
restored to health, which would be accomplished by the Lord's Coming into the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is what Divine miracles are like as to the inward form they take. But miracles involving the 
use of magic hold nothing at all like that; they are performed by the evil to gain power over others, and in outward form seem to be the same as Divine miracles. The reason why they seem to be the same 
is that they start from order, and on its lowest level, where miracles present themselves, order always looks the same. Take for example the consideration that Divine Truth coming forth from the Lord 
has all power within it. This being so, truths also on the last and lowest levels of order have power within them, and therefore the evil use truths to gain power and exercise control over others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
To give another example, it is in accordance with order that in the next life states of affection and thought give rise to people's ideas of spatial position and distance, and that the distances 
seen to separate people from one another are determined by the differences in their states. The purpose behind this law of order from the Divine is that all within the Grand Man should be distinct from 
one another. But magicians in the next life misuse this law of order, for they bring about changes of state in others and then move them about, at one time to a position high up, at another to a position 
low down, and also force them into communities where they can serve as the magicians' subordinates. They misuse order in countless other ways like this. From all this it is evident that although 
in outward form miracles involving the use of magic seem to be the same as Divine miracles, inwardly they nevertheless have a contrary end in view. That is to say, they have in view the destruction 
of things of the Church, whereas Divine miracles have inwardly as their end in view the building up of things of the Church. They are like two beautiful women, one of whom because of her promiscuity is 
wholly rotten within, while the other because of her chastity or true matrimonial love is wholly pure within. Outwardly those women are alike, but inwardly they are as different as heaven and hell. </p>

`Et fecerunt ita magi Aegyptii incantationibus suis': quod significet quod falsificatores illorum effigiarent simile [abutendo ordine], constat ex significatione `magiae Aegyptiacae et incantationum' 
quod sint abusus ordinis Divini, de qua n. 5223, 6052, 7296.  Quod miracula attinet, sciendum quod Divina miracula differant a miraculis magicis ut caelum ab inferno; (t)Divina miracula procedunt (c)a 
Divino Vero, et progrediuntur secundum ordinem; effectus in ultimis sunt miracula quando Domino placet ut in illa forma sistantur; inde est quod omnia miracula Divina repraesentent status regni Domini 
in caelis, et regni Domini in terris seu Ecclesiae; haec est forma interna Divinorum miraculorum {1}; ita se habet cum omnibus miraculis in Aegypto, et quoque cum reliquis, de quibus in Verbo; omnia 
etiam miracula quae Ipse Dominus cum fuit in mundo, fecit, (x)significabant statum venturum Ecclesiae {2}, sicut quod (x)aperirentur oculi caecorum, aures surdorum, linguae mutorum, quod claudi ambularent, 
mutili et quoque leprosi sanarentur, {3}significabant quod tales qui significantur per caecos, surdos, mutos, claudos, mutilos, leprosos, reciperent evangelium, et spiritualiter sanarentur, et 
hoc per Adventum Domini in mundum; talia sunt Divina miracula in 2 forma sua interna; {4}at miracula magica nihil prorsus involvunt, fiunt {5} a malis ad potentiam sibi acquirendam super alios; et apparent 
in forma externa similia (t)Divinis miraculis; causa quod similia appareant, est quia ex ordine fluunt, et ordo apparet similis in {6}ultimis ubi sistuntur miracula; sicut pro exemplo: Divinum 
Verum procedens a Domino in Se omnem potentiam habet, inde est quod etiam {7}veris in ultimis ordinis insit potentia; {8}ideo mali per vera sibi acquirunt 3 potentiam, et dominantur super alios; {9} 
sit quoque pro exemplo: secundum ordinem est ut status affectionis et cogitationis faciant ideam loci {10}et distantiae (d)in altera vita, et quod tantum a se mutuo {11}appareant distare, quantum in diverso 
statu sunt; {12}hoc ordinis a Divino est ut omnes qui in Maximo Homine distincti a se mutuo sint; magi in altera vita hoc ordinis abutuntur, inducunt enim aliis mutationes status, et sic illos 
transferunt nunc in altum, nunc in profundum, et quoque conjiciunt {13}in societates, ut inserviant {14}sibi pro subjectis; ita {15} innumeris aliis; {8}ex his patet quod miracula magica tametsi in externa 
forma similia appareant miraculis Divinis, usque tamen intus in se finem habeant contrarium, nempe destruendi illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, at miracula Divina intus in se habent finem aedificandi illa 
quae Ecclesiae sunt; se habent illa sicut binae muliere formosae, quarum una ex scortatione intus tota quanta putida est, altera autem ex castitate aut ex genuino amore conjugiali tota quanta intus 
pura est; externae formae {16}illarum sunt similes, sed internae differunt sicut caelum et infernum. 	@1 i quae a Divino$ 	@2 i spiritualis$ 	@3 involvebant$ 	@4 ac I$ 	@5 i enim$ 	@6 ultimo$ 	@7 
veris in ultimis altered to vero in ultimo$ 	@8 inde$ 	@9 i haec potentia, quia fluit ex ordine, similis apparet in forma externa, sed i forma interna est diabolica, quia propter potentiam et dominium
