<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5467节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5467.</strong>创世记42:21-24.他们彼此说，我们对我们兄弟实在有罪。他哀求我们的时候，我们见他灵魂愁苦，却不肯听，所以这场苦难临到我们身上。流便回答他们说，我岂不是对你们说过么？说不可得罪那孩子，只是你们不肯听，看哪，他的血在追讨了。他们不知道约瑟听见他们，因为在他们之间有传译官。约瑟转身离开他们，哭了一场，又回到他们那里，与他们说话；就从他们中间挑出西缅来，在他们眼前把他捆绑。<br />“他们彼此说”表对原因的觉知。“我们对我们兄弟实在有罪”表它们理应受到责备，因为它们不接受良善，从而疏远了内在。“我们见他灵魂愁苦”表一旦内在被疏远，它在良善方面的状态。“他哀求我们的时候，却不肯听”表它不断恳求，却得不到接受。“流便回答他们说”表仍源于教义和理解力中的信的觉知。“我岂不是对你们说过么？说”表来自那里的觉知的程度。“不可得罪那孩子”表它们不可分离（即外在与内在不可分离）。“只是你们不肯听”表不接受。“看哪，他的血在追讨了”表随后良心的痛悔。“他们不知道约瑟听见他们”表凭这些真理所在的属世之光不会相信，属灵之光使一切事物都变得可见。“因为在他们之间有传译官”表这时属灵事物以完全不同的方式被理解。“约瑟转身离开他们”表稍微退离。“哭了一场”表怜悯。“又回到他们那里，与他们说话”表流注。“就从他们中间挑出西缅来”表意愿中的信。“把他捆绑”表分离。“在他们眼前”表觉知。</p>

Verses 21-24. And they said a man to his brother, We are surely guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress 
come unto us. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hearken? And moreover behold his blood is searched for. And they knew 
not that Joseph heard them; for there was an interpreter between them. And he turned about from upon them and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke unto them, and took Simeon from them, and bound 
him before their eyes. "And they said a man to his brother," signifies perception concerning the cause; "We are surely guilty concerning our brother," signifies that they are to blame because they have 
alienated the internal by non-reception of good; "in that we saw the distress of his soul," signifies the state of the internal in regard to good when it was alienated; "when he besought us, and we 
would not hear," signifies its continual entreaty without reception; "and Reuben answered them, saying," signifies perception still from faith in doctrine and in the understanding; "Spoke I not unto 
you, saying," signifies the degree of perception thence; "Do not sin against the child," signifies that they should not be disjoined; "and ye would not hearken," signifies non-reception; "and moreover 
behold his blood is searched for," signifies the stings of conscience thence; "and they knew not that Joseph heard them," signifies that from the natural light in which those truths are, it is not believed 
that all things appear from spiritual light; "for there was an interpreter between them," signifies that then spiritual things are apprehended quite differently; "and he turned about from upon 
them," signifies somewhat of drawing back; "and wept," signifies mercy; "and he returned to them, and spoke to them," signifies influx; "and took Simeon from them," signifies faith in the will; "and 
bound him," signifies separation; "before their eyes," signifies to the perception. </p>

Verses 21-24 And they said, a man to his brother, Assuredly we are guilty concerning our brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he pleaded with us and we did not hear; therefore this anguish has 
come upon us. And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not say to you, saying, Do not sin against the boy - and you did not listen? And also, his blood; behold, it is required. And they did not know that 
Joseph was hearing, because the interpreter was between them. And he turned away from them and wept; and he came back to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon from them, and bound him before their 
eyes. </p>
<p>'And they said, a man to his brother' means a perception as to the reason why. 'Assuredly we are guilty concerning our brother' means that they were blameworthy because they had alienated 
the internal by their non-acceptance of good. 'Whose anguish of soul we saw' means the state of the internal in regard to good, once it was alienated. 'When he pleaded with us and we did not hear' means 
its constant entreaty without ever gaining acceptance. 'And Reuben answered them, saying' means that a perception nevertheless existed, springing from faith in doctrine and in the understanding. 
'Did I not say to you, saying' means the degree of perception from there. 'Do not sin against the boy' means lest they become separated [the external from the internal]. 'And you did not listen' means 
non-acceptance. 'And also, his blood; behold, it is required' means the subsequent remorse of conscience. 'And they did not know that Joseph was hearing' means that the natural light in which those truths 
dwell does not engender any belief that spiritual light renders all things visible. 'Because the interpreter was between them' means that at this time spiritual things are understood in a completely 
different manner. 'And he turned away from them' means somewhat of a withdrawal. 'And wept' means mercy. 'And he came back to them and spoke to them' means an influx. 'And he took Simeon from them' 
means faith in the will. 'And bound him' means a separation. 'Before their eyes' means a discernment. </p>

Vers. 21-24.  Et dixerunt vir ad fratrem suum, Profecto rei sumus nos super fratrem nostrum, cujus vidimus angustiam animae in deprecando illo ad nos, et non audivimus, propterea venit ad nos angustia 
haec. Et respondit Reuben illis, dicendo, Nonne dixi ad vos dicendo, Ne peccetis in natum? et non auscultavistis, et etiam sanguis ejus ecce inquiritur. Et illi non sciverunt quod audiens Joseph, quia 
interpres inter illos. Et conversus a super illis, et flevit, et rediit ad illos, et locutus ad illos; et accepit ex illis Shimeonem, et vincivit illum ad oculos illorum. `Et dixerunt vir ad fratrem 
suum' significat perceptionem de causa: `Profecto rei sumus nos super fratrem nostrum' significat quod in culpa sint quia abalienaverunt internum per non receptionem boni: `cujus vidimus angustiam 
animae' significat statum interni in bono cum abalienatum : `in deprecando illo ad nos, et non audivimus' significat ejus continuam sollicitationem absque receptione: {1} `et respondit Reuben illis dicendo' 
significat usque perceptionem ex fide doctrina et intellectu: `Nonne dixi ad vos dicendo' significat perceptionis gradum inde:  `Ne peccetis in natum' significat ne sejungantur: et non auscultavistis' 
significat non receptionem: `et etiam sanguis ejus ecce inquiritur' significat conscientiae morsus inde: `et illi non sciverunt quod audiens Joseph' significat quod e naturali luce, in qua vera 
illa, non credatur quod e spirituali luce omnia appareant: quia interpres inter illos' significat quod tunc spiritualia prorsus aliter capiantur: `et conversus a super illis' significat aliquid retractionis: 
`et flevit' significat misericordiam: `et rediit ad illos, et locutus ad illos' significat influxum: `et accepit ex illis Shimeonem' significat fidem voluntate: `et vincivit illum' significat 
separationem: `ad oculos illorum' significat ad apperceptionem. @1 S omits propterea venit ad nos angustia haec$ </p>
