<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7442节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7442.</strong>“并且埃及人的各家和他们所住的地，都要满了讨厌的苍蝇”表恶毒的虚假将占据属世心智的一切事物。这从“满了”、“埃及人的各家”、“讨厌的苍蝇”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：“满了”是指占据；“埃及人的各家”是指属世心智的内层部分，如前所述（<a href="7407.htm">7407</a>节）；“讨厌的苍蝇”是指是指恶毒的虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）；“埃及地”是指总体上的属世心智（参看<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5278.htm">5278</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5288.htm">5288</a>，<a href="5301.htm">5301</a>节）。<br />必须简要说明这个观念，即：属世心智的内层部分将被由存在于该心智最外在部分中的邪恶所产生的占据。从主经由天堂流入人里面的事物流入他的内层部分，并蔓延至最低层或最外层，在那里以可感觉的形式呈现给人。因此，它们向下流入感官层，并通过感官层流入身体部位。如果感官层充满基于幻觉和表象的错误观念，尤其充满基于虚假的错误观念，那么所流入的真理就在那里变成类似观念，因为它们在那里照着强加于它们的形式而被接受（参看<a href="7343.htm">7343</a>节）。真理变成虚假到何等程度，作为真理通道的心智内层部分就被关闭到何等程度。最终这个开口只够容纳最少量的流注，以赋予此人进行推理并利用虚假为邪恶辩护的能力。<br />由于这就是人的情况，所以当他正在被重生时，他的属世层必须被重生至感官层；事实上，除非该层被重生，否则就没有对真理和良善的接受，因为如前所述，所流入的真理在那里被败坏，在这种情况下，内层部分被关闭。因此，当外层部分被重生时，整个人就被重生了。这就是主在给彼得洗脚时，对他所说那些话的意思：<br />西门彼得说，主啊，不但我的脚，连手和头也要洗！耶稣对他说，凡洗过澡的人，只要把脚一洗，全身就干净了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.9.htm">13:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“脚”表示属世事物或形成属世层的部分（<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节）；“洗”表示洁净（<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>节）；“手”表示属世层的内层部分；“头”表示属灵事物或形成属世层的部分。由此明显可知“凡洗过澡的人，只要把脚一洗，全身就干净了”表示什么，即：当形成属世层的外层部分重生时，一个人就重生了。因此，当人甚至在属世层方面也重生了时，在该层的一切事物就服从于更内层。当更内层的事物进入时，它们就会流入该层作为包含它们的总体器皿的形像中，此人通过这些形像而意识到它们。当人的情况是这样时，他会明显感觉到对信之真理的情感和对仁之良善的情感。<br />不过，感官层本身，也就是属世层的最低层很难被重生，因为它充满由尘世、肉体和世俗事物所形成的物质观念。因此，正在重生的人，尤其如今正在重生的人，不会经历感官层的重生，只经历紧邻它之上的属世层的重生；当他思想信之真理和良善时，主将他从感官层提升至属世层。正在被主重生的人被赋予从感官层被提升的能力。至于感官层的性质，以及超越它的思维提升，可参看前文（<a href="5084.htm">5084</a>，<a href="5089.htm">5089</a>，<a href="5094.htm">5094</a>，<a href="5125.htm">5125</a>，<a href="5128.htm">5128</a>，<a href="5767.htm">5767</a>，<a href="6183.htm">6183</a>，<a href="6201.htm">6201</a>，<a href="6310.htm">6310</a>，<a href="6311.htm">6311</a>，<a href="6313.htm">6313</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6316.htm">6316</a>，<a href="6318.htm">6318</a>，<a href="6564.htm">6564</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>，<a href="6612.htm">6612</a>，<a href="6614.htm">6614</a>，<a href="6622.htm">6622</a>，<a href="6624.htm">6624</a>，<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>，<a href="6845.htm">6845</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="6949.htm">6949</a>节）。</p>

And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the noisome fly, and also the land whereon they are. That this signifies that the falsities of malevolence will take possession of all things of the 
natural mind, is evident from the signification of "filling," as being to take possession of; from the signification of "the house of the Egyptians," as being the interiors of the natural mind (of 
which above, n. 7407); from the signification of "the noisome fly," as being falsities of malevolence (of which just above, n. 7441); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being the natural 
mind in general (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). [2] How it is that the interiors also of the natural mind shall be taken possession of by the falsities of evil which are in the outermost 
parts of this mind, must be briefly told. The things that flow in with man through heaven from the Lord, flow into his interiors, and advance down to the ultimates or outermost parts, and there they 
are presented to man in a sensible form, consequently they flow down into the sensuous, and through this into the things of the body. If the sensuous has been filled with phantasies from fallacies and 
appearances, and especially if it has been filled with phantasies from falsities, then the truths which flow in are there turned into similar things, for they are received there according to the form 
that is induced on them (see n. 7343). Insofar also as truths are turned into falsities, so far the interiors through which they pass are closed, and at last there is no opening beyond that which is 
necessary for a sufficient transflux to confer the faculty of reasoning, and of confirming evils by means of falsities. [3] Such being the case with man, it must needs be that while he is being regenerated 
his natural must be regenerated down to the sensuous; for unless this is regenerated, there is no reception of truth and good, because, as before said, the inflowing truth is there perverted, and 
then the interiors are closed. And therefore when the exteriors have been regenerated, the whole man has been regenerated, as was signified by the Lord's words to Peter when He washed his feet: </p>
<p>  
   Simon Peter said unto Him, Lord, wash Thou not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, He that hath been bathed needeth not save to have his feet washed, and is clean every 
whit (John 13:9-10); </p>
<p>by the "feet" are signified natural things (n. 2162, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952); by "washing" is signified purifying (n. 3147, 5954); by "hands" are signified the interiors of 
the natural; and by the "head" spiritual things; hence is plain what is meant by "him that hath been bathed needing only to have his feet washed, and being clean every whit," namely, that a man has already 
been regenerated when he has been regenerated also in respect to the exteriors that belong to the natural. When therefore man has been regenerated also in respect to the natural, then all things 
therein have been made subordinate to the more interior things; and when these flow in there, they flow as into their generals, by which they present themselves to man in a sensible form. When this is 
the case with a man, he sensibly feels the affection of the truth that is of faith, and the affection of the good that is of charity. [4] But the sensuous itself, which is the ultimate of the natural, 
can with difficulty be regenerated, because it has been filled with material ideas from things earthly, bodily, and worldly. Therefore the man who is being regenerated, especially at this day, is 
not regenerated as to the sensuous, but as to the natural which is next above the sensuous, to which he is elevated by the Lord from the sensuous, when he is thinking about the truths and goods of faith. 
The man who is being regenerated by the Lord is endowed with the capacity of elevation from the sensuous. With respect to the nature of the sensuous, and the elevation of the thought above it, see 
n. 5084, 5089, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5767, 6183, 6201, 6310, 6311, 6313, 6314, 6316, 6318, 6564, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 6624, 6844, 6845, 6948, 6949.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7442</b></p><p><b>7442.</b>
'And the houses of the Egyptians will be full of the noxious flying insects, and also the land on which they are' means that malevolent falsities will take possession of everything in the natural mind. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'filling' as taking possession of; from the meaning of 'the houses of the Egyptians' as the interior parts of the natural mind, dealt with above in <a href="7407.htm">7407</a>; from the 
meaning of 'noxious flying insects' as malevolent falsities, dealt with immediately above in <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the natural mind in general, dealt with in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5178.htm">5178</a>, <a href="5180.htm">5180</a>, <a href="5288.htm">5288</a>, <a href="5301.htm">5301</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A brief statement needs to be made about what is implied in the meaning here - by the idea that even the interior parts of the natural mind will be taken possession of by the 
falsities arising from evil which are present in the outermost parts of that mind. What a person has flowing into him from the Lord by way of heaven flows into the interior parts of him, and then spreads 
right down to the lowest or outermost levels, where he becomes conscious of it. Consequently it comes right down into the level of the senses, and through this into parts of the body. If the level 
of the senses is filled with mistaken ideas based on illusions and appearances, and especially if they are based on falsities, the truths that flow in are turned there into similar ideas, since they 
are received there in accordance with the form imposed on them, see <a href="7743.htm">7743</a>. Also to the extent that truths are turned into falsities the interior parts of the mind serving as channels for the passage of 
truths are closed. Eventually the opening is only just large enough for the smallest amount of influx that the person needs to engage in reasoning and to use falsities to justify evils.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This 
being the situation with a person, it is necessary when he is being regenerated for his natural to be regenerated right down to the sensory level. For unless that level is regenerated no reception of 
truth and good takes place, because - as stated above - truth that is flowing in is perverted there and the interiors parts are in those circumstances closed. Consequently when the exterior parts have 
been regenerated the whole person has been regenerated. This was what the Lord meant by His words to Peter when He washed his feet, in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Simon Peter said, Lord, You are not to wash my feet only, 
but also my hands and head. Jesus said to him, He who has been washed has no need except to wash his feet, and the whole person is clean. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Feet' means the parts forming the natural, 
<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>; 'washing' means purifying, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="5954.htm">5954</a> (end); 'hands' means the interior parts of the natural; and 'head' means the parts forming the spiritual. These meanings show 
what precisely one should understand by 'he who has been washed has no need except to wash his feet, and the whole person is clean' - that a person has been regenerated when even the exterior parts 
forming the natural have been regenerated. When therefore a person has had even his natural regenerated everything on that level is subordinated to more internal levels. And when the contents of the 
more internal levels enter they flow into images on that level which serve as the general vessels to contain them, and through those images the person is made conscious of them. When this is the situation 
with a person, he has conscious feelings of an affection for the truth of faith and of an affection for the good of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But it is difficult for the actual level of the senses, which is 
the lowest of the natural, to be regenerated, because it is completely filled with material ideas formed from earthly, bodily, and worldly things. For this reason a person who is being regenerated, 
especially at the present day, does not undergo regeneration at the sensory level, only at the natural level immediately above it, to which the Lord raises him from the level of the senses when he thinks 
about the truths and forms of the good of faith. The ability to be raised from the sensory level is what is imparted to the person who is being regenerated by the Lord. Regarding what the sensory 
level is like, and the raising of thought above it, see <a href="5084.htm">5084</a>, <a href="5089.htm">5089</a>, <a href="5094.htm">5094</a>, <a href="5125.htm">5125</a>, <a href="5118.htm">5118</a>, <a href="5767.htm">5767</a>, <a href="6183.htm">6183</a>, <a href="6201.htm">6201</a>, <a href="6310.htm">6310</a>,<a href="6311.htm">6311</a>, <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>, <a href="6612.htm">6612</a>, <a href="6614.htm">6614</a>, <a href="6622.htm">6622</a>, <a href="6624.htm">6624</a>, <a href="6844.htm">6844</a>, <a href="6845.htm">6845</a>, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>. </p>

Et implebuntur domus Aegyptiorum volatili noxio, et etiam terra super qua illa': quod significet quod falsa malevolentiae occupabunt omnia mentis naturalis, constat ex significatione `implere' quod

et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit mens naturalis in communi, de qua n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301. 	2 Quomodo cum hoc se habet, quod etiam interiora mentis naturalis occupabuntur a 
falsis mali quae sunt in externis {1}illius mentis, paucis dicendum: quae influunt per caelum a Domino apud hominem, illa influunt in interiora ejus, et pergunt usque ad ultima seu extrema, (c)et ibi 
sistuntur homini sensibilia, consequenter influunt usque in sensuale, et per hoc in illa quae corporis sunt; si sensuale (t)oppletum est phantasiis ex fallaciis ac apparentiis, et magis si ex falsis, 
tunc vera quae influunt vertuntur ibi in similia, nam recipiuntur {2}ibi secundum formam inductam, videatur n. 7343; quantum (d)etiam vera in falsa vertuntur, tantum interiora, per quae transitus fit, 
{3}clauduntur, et tandem non plus {4}patet quam {5}ut transfluat modo quantum dare potest facultatem ratiocinandi, et confirmandi mala per falsa. 	3 Quia {6} ita se habet apud hominem, necessum est 
ut {7}dum is regeneratur, ejus naturale usque ad sensuale regeneretur, nam nisi id regeneratur, nulla est receptio veri ac boni, quoniam, ut supra dictum est, verum influens ibi pervertitur, et tunc 
interiora clauduntur; quapropter cum exteriora regenerata sunt, totus homo regeneratus est; hoc significatum est per Domini verba ad Petrum cum lavit pedes (c)ejus, apud Johannem, Dixit Simon Petrus, 
Domine, non laves pedes meos tantum, sed etiam manus et caput: dixit illi Jesus, Qui lotus est non opus habet, nisi ut quoad pedes lavetur, et mundus est totus, xiii 9, 10; </p>
<p>per `pedes' significantur 
naturalia, n. 2162, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952; per `lavare' significatur purificare, n. 3147, 5954 fin.; per `manus' {8}significantur interiora naturalis, et per `caput' spiritualia' inde patet quid 
intelligitur per `qui lotus est non opus habet, nisi ut quoad pedes lavetur, et mundus est totus,' quod scilicet homo tunc regeneratus sit, cum etiam quoad exteriora, quae sunt naturalis, regeneratus 
est; {9}cum itaque homo etiam quoad naturale regeneratus est, tunc {10} omnia ibi subordinata sunt interioribus, ac interiora cum influunt, ibi influunt ut in sua communia per quae se sistunt homini 
sensibilia; cum ita est apud hominem, tunc ab illo sentitur affectio veri quod fidei, et affectio boni quod charitatis. 	4 {11}Ast ipsum sensuale, quod est ultimum naturalis, aegre potest regenerari, 
ex causa quia (c)id ideis materialibus ex terrestribus, corporeis, et mundanis prorsus oppletum est; idcirco homo qui regeneratur, imprimis hodie, non regeneratur quoad sensuale, sed quoad naturale 
quod proxime supra sensuale est, ad quod a sensuali elevatur a Domino cum cogitat de veris et bonis fidei; facultas elevationis a sensuali est qua donatur homo {7}qui regeneratur a Domino; de sensuali
