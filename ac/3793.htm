<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3793节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3793.</strong>“拉结领着羊群来了”表对属于教会和教义的内层真理的情感。这从“拉结”的代表和“羊群”的含义清楚可知：“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感；“羊群”是指教会，以及教义（<a href="3767.htm">3767</a>，<a href="3768.htm">3768</a>，<a href="3783.htm">3783</a>节）。为让人们了解“拉结”代表对内层真理的情感，“利亚”代表对外层真理的情感是怎么回事，现就这个问题作以简要说明。雅各所代表的属世层由良善与真理构成，这个属世层，和人的每一个部分，以及整个自然界一样，里面必有一个良善与真理的婚姻。如果没有这个婚姻，什么也不会产生，因为一切产生和一切结果都来自这婚姻。然而，当人出生时，这良善与真理的婚姻并不存在于人的属世层里面，因为和其它生物不同，人没有生在神序中。人的确拥有纯真和仁爱的良善，这良善是在他幼年时从主流入的，但能该良善结合的真理并不存在。随着他年龄增长，幼年时被主注入到他里面的这良善就被吸向内层，并被主保守在那里，以便它能缓和他后来所具有的生命状态。因此，如果没有他婴儿和幼年时的良善，人比任何野兽都更坏、更凶残。当这幼年时的良善被吸入内部时，邪恶就会取而代之，并进入此人的属世层。那时，虚假便这邪恶苟合，然后一种联结，可以说一个邪恶与虚假的婚姻就在他里面产生了。所以，此人若要得救，必须重生，邪恶必须被除去，良善必须被主注入进来。真理照着他接受这良善的程度而被注入到他里面，以便良善与真理的结合，或可以说婚姻能够实现。<br />这些就是雅各和他的两个妻子，拉结和利亚所代表的事。因此，现在“雅各”成了属世良善的代表，而“拉结”成了真理的代表。但由于真理与结合的一切结合都是通过情感实现的，所以与良善结合的真理情感由“拉结”来代表。此外，和理性层一样，属世层也有一个内层和一个外层。“拉结”代表对内层真理的情感，而“利亚”则代表对外层真理的情感。“拉班”，也就是她们的父亲，代表源自一个共同家族的良善；不过，这良善是旁系良善，如前所述。这良善就是与“利百加”所表示的理性层真理（参看<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）相对应的旁系良善。因此，由该良善所生的女儿代表属世层里面的情感，因为这些就像如父亲般的那良善所生的女儿。由于这些情感要与属世良善结合，所以她们代表对真理的情感，一个代表对内层真理的情感，另一个代表对外层真理的情感。<br />人的属世层的重生完全就像雅各和拉班的两个女儿，即拉结和利亚。因此，凡能明白并理解圣言内义的人就会明白向他透露的这个奥秘。但除了处于良善与真理的人外，没有人能明白它。其他人，无论他们对关乎私人生活和社会生活的事多么明察秋毫，并由此显得多么聪明绝顶，仍无法看到、然后承认有关这个奥秘的任何事。事实上，他们甚至不知道何为良善与真理，反而视邪恶为良善，视虚假为真理。因此，一提及良善，邪恶的观念就呈现出来；一提及真理，虚假的观念就呈现出来。结果，他们对包含在内义中的事物没有丝毫觉察；相反，一旦他们听到有关它的任何事物，黑暗就会降临，从而熄灭那光。</p>

Rachel came with the flock. That this signifies the affection of the interior truth which is of the church and of doctrine, is evident from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior 
truth; and from the signification of a "flock," as being the church and also doctrine (n. 3767, 3768, 3783.) That it may be known how the case is with the representation of Rachel as being the affection 
of interior truth, and of Leah as being the affection of exterior truth, it shall be briefly stated that the natural which is represented by Jacob consists of good and truth, and that in this 
natural, as in all things of man and of universal nature in general and particular there must be the marriage of good and truth. Without this marriage nothing is produced-all production and all effect 
being therefrom. This marriage of good and truth, however, does not exist in man's natural when he is born, because man alone is not born into Divine order; he does indeed possess the good of innocence 
and of charity, which in his earliest infancy flows in from the Lord, but there is no truth with which this good may be coupled. As he advances in years, this good which in infancy had been insinuated 
into him by the Lord is drawn in toward the interiors, and is there kept by the Lord, in order that it may temper the states of life which he afterwards puts on. This is the reason why without the 
good of his infancy and first childhood man would be worse and more fierce than any wild beast. When this good of infancy is being drawn in, evil comes in its place and enters into man's natural, and 
with this evil falsity couples itself, and there takes place in the man the conjunction, and as it were the marriage, of evil and falsity. In order therefore that man may be saved, he must be regenerated, 
and evil must be removed, and good from the Lord insinuated, and according to the good which he receives, truth is insinuated into him, for the purpose of effecting the coupling, or as it were 
the marriage, of good and truth. [2] These are the things represented by Jacob, and by his two wives, Rachel and Leah. Jacob therefore now puts on the representation of the good of the natural, and Rachel 
the representation of truth; but as all the conjunction of truth with good is wrought by means of affection, it is the affection of truth to be coupled with good that is represented by Rachel. Moreover 
in the natural, as in the rational, there is an interior and an exterior; Rachel representing the affection of interior truth, and Leah the affection of exterior truth. Laban, who is their father, 
represents the good of a common stock, but the collateral good, as before stated; which good is that which in a collateral line corresponds to the truth of the rational, which is signified by "Rebekah" 
(see n. 3012, 3013, 3077). Hence the daughters from this good represent the affections in the natural, for these are as daughters from this good as from a father. And as these affections are to 
be coupled with natural good, they represent the affections of truth; the one the affection of interior truth, and the other the affection of exterior truth.  [3] As regards the regeneration of man 
in respect to his natural, the case is altogether the same as it is with Jacob and the two daughters of Laban, Rachel and Leah; and therefore whoever is able to see and apprehend the Word here according 
to its internal sense, sees this arcanum disclosed to him. But no one can see this except the man who is in good and truth. Whatever perception others may have of things therein relating to moral and 
civic life, and however intelligent they may thereby appear, still they can see nothing of this nature so as to acknowledge it; for they do not know what good and truth are, but suppose evil to be 
good and falsity to be truth; and therefore the moment that good is mentioned, the idea of evil is presented; and when truth is mentioned, the idea of falsity; consequently they perceive nothing of these 
contents of the internal sense, but as soon as they hear them darkness appears and extinguishes the light. </p>

'Rachel came with the flock' means the affection for interior truth belonging to the Church and to doctrine. This is clear from the representation of 'Rachel' as the affection for interior truth, and 
from the meaning of 'the flock' as the Church and also as doctrine, dealt with in <a href="3767.htm">3767</a>, <a href="3768.htm">3768</a>, <a href="3783.htm">3783</a>. To enable it to be known how 'Rachel' represents the affection for interior truth, and 'Leah' the affection 
for exterior truth, let a brief statement be made about the matter: The natural, which 'Jacob' represents, consists of good and of truth; and within the natural, as within every single part in 
the human being, and indeed within the whole natural order, there ought to be a marriage of good and truth. Without this marriage nothing is produced, for every act of bringing forth and every effect 
is from that marriage. When he is born there is no marriage of good and truth within a person's natural because the human being, unlike other creatures, is not born into a condition where Divine order 
is present. It is true that good which goes with innocence and charity is present, flowing from the Lord in earliest childhood; but no truth is present to which that good may be coupled. As he advances 
in life this good which has been instilled by the Lord into a person in early childhood is drawn in towards the interior parts and kept there by the Lord so that it may serve to modify the states 
of life which he experiences subsequently. As a consequence without the good belonging to his infancy and early childhood the human being would be worse and more vicious than any wild animal. When that 
good belonging to earliest childhood is drawn inwards, evil in that case takes its place and enters the person's natural. Falsity then couples itself to that evil, and a joining together and so to 
speak a marriage of evil and falsity takes place with him. If a person is to be saved therefore, he has to be regenerated. Evil has to be removed and good instilled by the Lord. And in the measure that 
he receives good truth is instilled into him so that a coupling, or so to speak marriage, of good and truth takes place. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These are the matters represented by Jacob and his two wives, Rachel and 
Leah. 'Jacob' now takes on the representation of natural good therefore, and 'Rachel' that of truth. But since all joining of truth to good is effected through affection, it is the affection for truth 
coupled to good that 'Rachel' represents. Furthermore the natural, like the rational, has an interior and an exterior. 'Rachel' represents the affection for interior truth, and 'Leah' the affection 
for exterior truth. 'Laban', who is their father, represents a good that springs from a common stock, but is a parallel good, as has been stated. That good is the good which in the parallel line corresponds 
to the truth of the rational, which is 'Rebekah', <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>. Daughters descended from that good therefore represent affections existing within the natural, for these are like daughters 
fathered by that good. And because those affections are to be coupled to natural good they consequently represent affections for truth - the first representing the affection for interior truth, the second 
the affection for exterior truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The regeneration of a person's natural is altogether like Jacob and Laban's two daughters, Rachel and Leah. Anyone therefore who can see and understand the 
internal sense of the Word sees this arcanum which has been disclosed to him, but no one else is able to see it except him in whom good and truth are present. No others, no matter how good a perception 
they may have of the things to do with personal life and life in society and may seem to be highly intelligent, are able to see and then to acknowledge anything at all of that arcanum. Indeed they 
do not know what good and truth are, for they imagine evil to be good, and falsity to be truth. For this reason the moment good is mentioned the idea of evil presents itself, and the moment truth is 
mentioned the idea of falsity does so. Consequently they perceive nothing of the things contained in the internal sense, but as soon as they hear anything of it darkness descends which extinguishes the light. </p>

`Et Rachel venit cum grege': quod significet affectionem veri interioris quae Ecclesiae et doctrinae, constat a repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris; et ex significatione 
`gregis' quod sit Ecclesia et quoque doctrina, de qua n. 3767, 3768, 3783.  Ut sciatur quomodo se habet {1} cum repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris, et cum `Leae' quod sit 
affectio veri exterioris, paucis dicendum: </p>
<p>naturale quod per `Jacobum' repraesentatur, ex bono et vero consistit, et in eo, nempe naturali (o), sicut in omnibus et singulis in homine, immo in universa 
natura, conjugium boni et veri esse debet; absque conjugio boni et veri nihil producitur, omnis productio et omnis effectus est inde; in naturali apud hominem cum nascitur, non est conjugium 
boni et veri, quia solus homo non in ordinem Divinum nascitur; est quidem bonum innocentiae et charitatis, quod in prima infantia influit a Domino, sed non est aliquod verum cui bonum illud copuletur; 
in aetate progrediente hoc bonum quod in infantia insinuatum ei est a Domino, versus inferiora intrahitur, et ibi tenetur a Domino, ut per id temperentur status vita quos postea induit; inde est 
quod homo absque bono infantiae suae ac primae pueritiae omni fero animali pejor et magis ferus foret; eum bonum id infantiae intrahitur, tunc in naturale hominis succedit et intrat malum, cui se 
copulat falsum, et fit conjunctio et quasi conjugium mali et falsi apud eum; ut itaque salvetur homo, regenerandus est, et  removendum {2} malum, ac {3} insinuandum bonum a Domino, et secundum bonum 
quod recipit, insinuatur ei verum ut fiat boni et veri copulatio, seu quasi conjugium; [2] haec sunt quae repraesentantur per Jacobum, et per binas ejus uxores, nempe Rachelem et Leam; `Jacobus' 
ideo nunc induit repraesentationem boni naturalis, et `Rachel' repraesentationem veri {4} ; sed quia omnis conjunctio veri cum bono fit per affectionem, est affectio veri copulandi bono quam Rachel 
repraesentat; praeterea in naturali sicut in rationali datur interius et exterius; `Rachel' repraesentat affectionem veri interioris, et `Leah' affectionem veri exterioris. `Laban,' qui pater illarum, 
repraesentat bonum communis stirpis, sed collaterale, ut dictum, quod bonum est id quod in collaterali linea correspondet vero rationalis quod est `Rebecca,' n. 3012, 3013, 3077, inde {5} filiae 
ex illo bono repraesentant affectiones in naturali, nam hae sunt ut filiae ea bono illo ut ex patre; et quia affectiones illae copulandae sunt bono naturali, ideo repraesentant affectiones veri, 
una affectionem veri interioris, altera affectionem veri exterioris. [3] Cum regeneratione hominis quoad ejus naturale, prorsus similiter se habet ac cum Jacobo et cum binis Labanis filiabus Rachele 
et Leah {6}; qui itaque Verbum hic secundum sensum ejus internum videre et capere potest, is arcanum hoc videt sibi detectum; sed hoc nullus alius videre potest quam qui in bono et vero est; alii, 
utcumque perceptionem rerum in illis quae vitae moralis et civilis sunt {7}, habent, et apparent sicut intelligentes, nihil tale usque ad agnitionem videre possunt, non enim sciunt quid bonum et 
verum, malum enim putant bonum, et falsum verum, quapropter ilico cum bonum dicitur, idea mali sistitur, et cum verum dicitur, idea falsi; inde est quod nihil percipiant de his quae in sensu interno continentur 
{8}, sed ad primam auditionem oboriantur tenebrae, quae lucem exstinguunt. @1 habet after exterioris$ @2 exstirpandum$ @3 et loco ejus$ @4 i affectionis$ @5 after bono$ @6 i cum 
bonum naturalis per Jacob et affectiones veri bono illo copulandis per Rachelem et Leam intelliguntur. A had at first veris for affectiones veri; this explains copulandis, which A omits to change.$ @7
