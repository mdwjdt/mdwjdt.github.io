<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1759节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1759.</strong>属天灵人的言语无法轻易流入适用于人的清晰声音或话语中，因为它不适合听上去很生硬的事物，或粗糙的双重辅音，或源于记忆知识的观念的词语中。因此，他们很少流入言语中，除非通过似溪流或微风般的情感软化这些话。介于属天灵人和属灵灵人之间的灵人言语是甜蜜的，如同最轻柔的微风拂过，抚慰接受者的器官，软化这些话本身，并且它也是快速、稳妥的。这种言语的流畅和优美是由于以下事实：他们观念中的属天良善具有这种性质，并且这种言语中没有任何与思维不一致的东西。在来世，一切甜蜜的和谐都出自良善与仁爱。属灵灵人的言语也是流畅的，但不那么轻柔、温和。说话的主要是这些灵人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1759.</strong> The language of heavenly spirits does not flow easily into the articulated sounds or words we use, because it cannot adapt to any word containing a harsh sound or hard, double consonants or a merely factual thought.{*1} As a result, heavenly spirits rarely flow into [our] speech except through emotion, which softens the words into something like a stream of water or breath of air.<br />Spirits who are midway between heavenly and spiritual have a sweet kind of language that flows along like the gentlest of breezes, caressing the listening ear and softening the actual words. It is also swift and sure. The reason for the fluidity and charm of their speech is that the heavenly goodness present in their thoughts has the same qualities, and that there is no discrepancy between their words and their thoughts. All sweet-sounding harmony in the other life comes from goodness and charity.<br />The language of those who are spiritual is also fluid but not as soft and gentle. They speak more than the others.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on vowels and consonants in the speech of angels, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1759/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_241" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 241</a>.

The speech of celestial spirits cannot easily flow into the articulate sounds or words that appertain to man; for it cannot be suited to a word in which there is anything that sounds harshly, or in which 
there is a rough doubling of consonants, or in which there is an idea that is derived from memory-knowledge; on which account they rarely flow into the speech otherwise than by affections which, 
like a flowing stream or a gentle breeze, soften the words. The speech of spirits who are intermediate between the celestial and the spiritual is sweet, flowing like the gentlest atmosphere, soothing 
the recipient organs, and softening the words themselves; it is also rapid and sure. The flow and the pleasantness of the speech come from the fact that the celestial good in their ideas is of this character, 
and there is nothing in the speech that dissents from the thought. All the sweet harmoniousness in the other life comes from goodness and charity. The speech of the spiritual also is flowing, 
but is not so soft and gentle. It is chiefly these who speak. </p>

The speech of celestial spirits cannot easily pass into the articulated sounds or expressions of human speech, for it cannot accommodate itself to any expression containing a shrill sound or rather harsh 
doubling of consonants. Nor can it accommodate itself to any expression which contains any idea based on factual knowledge. Consequently celestial spirits rarely influence speech other than through 
affections, which soften expressions like a stream or like a breath of air. The spirits who are mid-way between celestial and spiritual have a sweet form of speech which flows like the gentlest breeze, 
soothing the organs that receive it, and softening the actual expressions used. It is also swift and sure. The fluency and beauty of that speech is a product of the celestial good contained in their 
ideas which possesses the same qualities. Their speech is in no way out of keeping with their thought - everything sweet and harmonious in the next life derives from goodness and charity. The speech 
of the spiritual spirits also is fluent, but not so soft and gentle. These are principally the ones who use speech. </p>

</p><b>1759.</b>
Spirituum caelestium loquela non facile influere potest in sonos articulatos seu voces apud hominem, nam nulli voci inaptari potest in qua est aliquid sonans stridule, aut in qua est duplicatio durior 
consonantium, nec cui inest idea ex scientifico; quare raro influunt in loquelam aliter ac per affectiones, quae instar fluvii aut aurae emolliunt voces. Spirituum qui medii sunt inter caelestes et 
spirituales, loquela est dulcis, fluens instar lenissimae atmosphaerae, mulcens organa recipientia, et molliens ipsas voces, quoque cita et certa; fluiditas et amoenitas loquelae inde est quod caeleste 
bonum in ideis illorum tale sit, nec aliquid dissentiens loquelae a cogitatione; omne harmonicum dulce in altera vita est a bonitate et charitate.  Spiritualium loquela etiam fluida est, sed non ita 
mollis et lenis; hi sunt qui imprimis loquuntur. </p>
