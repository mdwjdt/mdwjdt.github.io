<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8275.</strong>“法老的战车、军兵，祂已抛在海中”表那里那些属于教会，却过着邪恶生活之人的邪恶所生的虚假，无论具体的还是总体的，以及这一事实，在祂面前，这些虚假将自己投入地狱。这从“战车”和“海”的含义，以及“法老”和“埃及人”的代表清楚可知：“战车”是指虚假（参看<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>，<a href="8215.htm">8215</a>节），在此是指具体的虚假，因为经上还提到“军兵”，“军兵（即军队）”表示虚假（参看<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；“法老”和“埃及人”是指那些属于教会，陷入分离之信，并过着邪恶生活，从而沉浸于邪恶所生的纯粹虚假之人（<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>，<a href="8132.htm">8132</a>，<a href="8135.htm">8135</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；“海”，此处即红海，是指那些沉浸于这些虚假的人所在的地狱（<a href="8099.htm">8099</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）。因此，“祂已抛在海中”表示祂已经抛在地狱；在内义上表示仅仅因为主的同在，他们就将自己扔进地狱（<a href="8265.htm">8265</a>节）。由此明显可知，“法老的战车、军兵，祂已抛在海中”表示那里那些属于教会，却过着邪恶生活之人的邪恶所生的虚假，无论具体的还是总体的，在主面前将自己投入地狱。</p>

Pharaoh's chariots and his army He hath cast into the sea. That this signifies that the falsities from evil, in particular and in general, of those who had been of the church and in a life of evil there, 
at His presence cast themselves into the hells, is evident from the signification of "chariots," as being falsities (see n. 8146, 8148, 8215), here falsities in particular, because the "army" also 
is mentioned, by which are signified falsities in general (that "armies" denote falsities, see n. 3448, 8138, 8146, 8148); from the representation of Pharaoh and of the Egyptians, as being those of 
the church who are in faith separate and in a life of evil, and consequently are in mere falsities from evil (n. 7926, 8132, 8135, 8138, 8148); and from the signification of "the sea," here the sea Suph, 
as being the hell where they are who are in these falsities (n. 8099, 8137, 8148). Consequently, "He cast into the sea," denotes that He cast into hell; in the internal sense, that at the mere presence 
of the Lord they cast themselves there (n. 8265). From all this it is evident that by "Pharaoh's chariots and his army He hath cast into the sea" is signified that the falsities from evil, in particular 
and in general, of those who had been of the church and in a life of evil there, at the presence of the Lord cast themselves into the hells. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8275</b></p><p><b>8275.</b>
'Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea' means the particular and the general falsities arising from evil of those belonging to the Church who led a life of evil in it, and the fact 
that at His presence those falsities have cast themselves into the hells. This is clear from the meaning of 'chariots' as falsities, dealt with in <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, <a href="8215.htm">8215</a>, at this point particular falsities 
since the word 'army', meaning general falsities, is also used (for the meaning of 'army' as falsities, see <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>, <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>); from the representation of 'Pharaoh' and of 'the Egyptians' as those 
belonging to the Church who uphold separated faith and lead a life of evil, and are therefore steeped in utter falsities arising from evil, dealt with in <a href="7926.htm">7926</a>, <a href="8132.htm">8132</a>, <a href="8135.htm">8135</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; and from the 
meaning of 'the sea', the Sea Suph at this point, as the hell where those steeped in those falsities are, dealt with in <a href="8099.htm">8099</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, so that 'He has thrown into the sea' means that He has cast 
into hell, in the internal sense that they have cast themselves into it simply at the presence of the Lord, see <a href="8265.htm">8265</a>. From all this it is evident that 'Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into 
the sea' means that the particular and the general falsities arising from evil of those belonging to the Church who led a life of evil in it have cast themselves at the presence of the Lord into the hells. </p>

`Currus Pharaonis et exercitum illius projecit in mare': quod significet falsa ex malo in specie et in genere illorum qui ab Ecclesia et ibi in vita mali, quod se ad praesentiam Ipsius conjecerint in 
inferna, constat ex significatione `curruum' quod sint falsa, de qua n. 8146, 8148, 8215, hic falsa in specie, quia etiam dicitur `exercitus,' per quem significantur falsa in genere; quod `exercitus' 
sint falsa, videatur n. 3448, 8138, 8146, 8148; ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis et Aegyptiorum' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia in fide separata ac in vita mali, ac inde in meris falsis ex malo, de qua n. 
7926, 8132, 8135, 8138, 8148; ex significatione `maris,' hic `maris Suph,' quod sit infernum ubi ii qui in illis falsis, de qua n. 8099, 8137, 8148; inde `projecit in mare' est quod conjecit in infernum,
