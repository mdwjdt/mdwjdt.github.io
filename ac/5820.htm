<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5820节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5820.</strong>“回去，给我们买些粮来”表真理之良善要变成他们自己的。这从“买”和“粮”的含义清楚可知：“买”是指变成人自己的（参看<a href="5397.htm">5397</a>，<a href="5406.htm">5406</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5426.htm">5426</a>节）；“粮”是指真理之良善（<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5426.htm">5426</a>，<a href="5487.htm">5487</a>，<a href="5582.htm">5582</a>，<a href="5588.htm">5588</a>，<a href="5655.htm">5655</a>节）。一般来说，属灵的粮食或食物包括一切良善，但尤指通过真理，也就是意愿与行为中的真理所获得的良善。因为凭着被意愿和践行，这真理变成良善，被称为真理之良善。真理若不以这种方式变成良善，对进入来世的人没有任何益处；事实上，当人进入来世时，它就会离开他而消散，因为它不符合他的意愿，因而不符合他的爱之快乐。在世时，人学习信之真理若不是为了意愿和践行它们，从而把它们变成良善，只是为了获得地位和利益而知道并教导它们，那么即便在世时被视为最有学问的，在来世仍被剥夺这些真理，只剩下他自己的意愿，也就是他的生命。那时，就这生命而言，他原来什么样，仍继续是什么样；令人惊讶的是，他会背离、讨厌一切信之真理，拒绝接受它们，无论他以前如何坚定地信奉它们。通过意愿和践行真理，也就是通过照真理生活而将真理转化为良善就是“给我们买些粮来”所表示的将真理之良善变成他们自己的含义。</p>

Return ye, buy us a little food. That this signifies that the good of truth should be appropriated, is evident from the signification of "buying," as being to appropriate to oneself (see n. 5397, 5406, 
5410, 5426); and from the signification of "food," as being the good of truth (n. 5410, 5426, 5487, 5582, 5588, 5655). Spiritual food is in general all good, but specifically it is the good which is 
acquired by means of truth, that is, truth in the will and in act, for this good becomes good from the willing and doing, and is called the good of truth. Unless truth thus becomes good, it does not 
benefit the man in the other life; for when he comes into the other life it is dissipated, because it does not agree with his will, thus not with the delight of his love. He who has learned truths of 
faith in the world, not for the sake of willing and doing them and thus turning them into goods, but only that he may know and teach them for the sake of honor and gain, even although he may in the world 
be considered most learned, yet in the other life he is deprived of the truths and is left to his own will, that is, his life. And he then remains as he had been in his life; and wonderful to say 
he is then averse to all the truths of faith: and denies them to himself, howsoever he had before confirmed them. To turn truths to goods by willing and doing them, that is, by life, is what is meant 
by appropriating the good of truth, which is signified by "buy us a little food." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5820</b></p><p><b>5820.</b>
'Return, buy us a little food' means that the good of truth should be made their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'buying' as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="5397.htm">5397</a>, <a href="5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="5426.htm">5426</a>; and from the 
meaning of 'food' as the good of truth, dealt with in <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="5426.htm">5426</a>, <a href="5487.htm">5487</a>, <a href="5582.htm">5582</a>, <a href="5588.htm">5588</a>, <a href="5655.htm">5655</a>. In general spiritual food includes all good, but specifically it is good acquired by means of truth, that is, 
truth existing in will and action. For by virtue of being willed and acted out that truth becomes good and is called the good of truth. Unless truth becomes good in this manner it is of no use whatever 
to a person in the next life; for when he enters that life it goes away from him because it does not fit in with what he wills or consequently with what he loves and takes delight in. In the world 
a person may have learned the truths of faith not so that he may will them and act them out, and in so doing may make them forms of good, but merely so that he may know and teach them with a view to 
acquiring position and gain. Even though as a result of this he may be reputed in the world to be very learned, those truths are taken away from him in the next life, and he is left with what he really 
wills, that is, with the life really his own. What he had been like so far as that life was concerned he continues to be; and, surprising though it may be, he turns away from all the truths of faith 
and refuses to accept them, no matter how firmly he had embraced them previously. The conversion of truths therefore into forms of good through willing them and acting them out, that is, through living 
according to them, is what making the good of truth their own implies, meant by 'buy us a little food'. </p>

`Revertimini, emite nobis parum cibi': quod significet quod appropriandum bonum veri, constat ex significatione `emere quod sit appropriare sibi, de qua n. 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426; et ex significatione 
`cibi' quod sit bonum veri, de qua n. 5410, 5426, 5487, 5582, 5588, 5655. Cibus spiritualis (t)est in genere omne bonum, in specie autem est bonum quod acquiritur per verum, hoc est, verum voluntate 
et actu; hoc enim fit bonum ex velle et agere, et vocatur bonum veri; verum nisi fiat {1}ita bonum, non conducit homini {2}in altera vita ad quicquam, cum enim in alteram vitam venit, dissipatur {3} 
quia non convenit cum ejus velle, proinde non cum ejus amoris jucundo; qui vera fidei {4}didicit in mundo, non propter velle et agere illa et sic vertere in bona, sed modo propter scire et docere illa 
honoris et lucri causa, (m)etiam si inde eruditissimus in mundo audit, usque vera illa in altera vita ei auferuntur, et is relinquitur suo velle, hoc est, suae vitae, et tunc qualis fuerat in sua vita, 
talis manet et, quod mirum, tunc aversatur {5} omnia vera fidei et {6}apud se negat, utcumque prius illa confirmaverat. Vera itaque vertere in bona per velle et agere illa, hoc est, per vitam, est
