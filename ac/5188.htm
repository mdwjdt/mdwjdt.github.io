<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5188节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5188.</strong>有些世人在行动时，其恶行是通过诡诈和谎言得逞的。其品质和行动方式向我指明，即他们如何利用没有恶意的人当工具来说服其他人，以及如何引诱其他人以某种方式说话，而他们自己对这个问题却保持沉默。简言之，他们利用邪恶的手段达到他们所要的任何目的；这些手段涉及欺骗、谎言和诡诈。这类灵人在被称为假性结节的恶性肿瘤中有自己的对应物，这些假性结节通常长在肺和其它细胞膜上。当这些溃疡牢牢扎根下来时，其恶性肿瘤就会扩散，最终使整个细胞膜溃烂。<br />这类灵人会受到严厉惩罚；不过，对他们的惩罚不同于对其他灵人的惩罚；对他们的惩罚通过旋转完成。他们从左向右旋转，就像一个物体一开始是平的，但随着旋转却肿胀起来。然后，这种结节状的肿胀似乎被压进去，变成空心；这时，速度提升；说来神奇，他们的这种肿胀，其形状和样式就像结节性的肿块或脓肿。我发现，正当这些灵人旋转的时候，他们试图把其他人（大多是无辜之人）拖进他们旋转的轨道，从而拖上毁灭之路。因此，他们根本不关心把谁拖上那条毁灭之路，只要他们觉得被拖进来的人正在被毁灭就行了。<br />我还发现，这些灵人有极其敏锐的视力。他们刹那间就将一切事物扫描个遍，从而抓住凡能作为支持他们自己目的的手段而服务于他们的任何东西。因此，他们比其他所有人都更机敏。他们还可称作致命性溃疡，无论这些溃疡是在胸腔、胸膜，还是在心包膜、纵隔或肺部。我被指示，惩罚过后，这类灵人就被扔进后面一个很深的地方，脸和肚子朝下趴在那里。他们只剩下一点点人类生命，并且丧失了像野兽一样生活时所具有的那种敏锐视力。他们的地狱在一个很深的地方，稍微靠前一点。</p>

There are some in the world who act by artifices and lies, whence come evils. Their quality was shown me, and also the manner in which they act, how they employ the harmless as instruments of persuading 
others, and also how they induce on them the person of having said so and so, when yet they have said nothing of the kind. In a word, they use evil means to arrive at their end, whatever it may be, 
even such means as deceits, lies, and artifices. Such spirits have reference to the sores called Spurious Tubercles, which usually grow on the pleura and other membranes; and wherever these sores take 
firm hold they spread their poison widely, until at last they bring decay upon the whole membrane. [2] Such spirits are severely punished; but their punishment is different from that of others, being 
effected by means of whirlings; for they are whirled round from left to right, like an orbit which at first is a plane, but which in whirling round swells out. Afterward the swelling seems to be pressed 
in and to grow hollow, whereupon the speed is increased; and wonderful to say this is according to the form and in imitation of such swellings or abscesses. It was observed that while being whirled 
they tried to draw others, for the most part the guiltless, into their whirl, and thus into destruction; thus that they did not care whom they drew into perdition, so long as these seemed to themselves 
to perish. [3] It was also observed that they have a most intense sight, seeing as it were instantly and thereby seizing on as means whatever is favorable; thus that they are sharper than others. 
They may also be called deadly ulcers, wherever in the chamber of the breast these may be, whether in the pleura, in the pericardium, in the mediastinum, or in the lungs. It was shown that after punishment 
such spirits are rejected to the back into the deep, and that they lie there with the face and belly downward, having but little human life, and being thereby deprived of their sharp-sightedness, 
which had been that of a ferine life. Their hell is in a deep place under the right foot, somewhat in front. </p>

There are certain people in the world who, when they act, employ tricks and lies to accomplish evil deeds. I have been shown what those people are like and the ways in which they act - how, when persuading 
others, they use as their agents those who will do no one any harm, and also how they induce other persons to speak in a certain way while they themselves remain silent on the matter. In short 
they employ evil means to attain whatever end they have in view, means that involve the use of deceit, lies, and trickery. Such spirits have their counterpart in malignant growths, called Spurious Tubercles, 
which usually develop in the lungs or other membranes. When these are deep-rooted their malignancy becomes widespread, so that at length they wreck the entire membrane. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Spirits of this 
kind undergo severe punishment. Theirs is different from the punishments suffered by other spirits; it involves their being whirled around. They are whirled around from left to right, like an object which 
is flat at first but swells out as it spins round. Then this tubercle-like swelling seems to be pressed in and made hollow, at which point the speed is increased. Amazingly, this swelling out of 
them is shaped like and is an imitation of tubercular lumps or apostemes. I noticed that while they were spinning round those spirits tried to draw others, for the most part blameless ones, into their 
orbit and so path of destruction. Thus they did not care at all whom they dragged into that path of destruction, so long as it seemed to them that those dragged in were being destroyed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 I also 
noticed that those spirits had very keen sight. They took only an instant to scan everything thoroughly so to speak and so seize upon whatever would serve them as means favouring their own ends. Thus 
they are more sharp-witted than all others. They may also be called deadly ulcers, wherever these occur within the cavity of the chest, whether in the pleura, or in the pericardium, or in the mediastinum, 
or in the lungs. I was shown that following punishment spirits of this kind are cast away into a deep place at the rear, where they lie face and belly downwards. There only a little human life is 
left to them, and the sharp-sightedness which they possessed when they lived like wild animals has been taken away from them. Their hell is situated in a deep place beneath the right foot, a little 
towards the front. </p>

</p><b>5188.</b>
Sunt quidam in mundo qui per artificia et mendacia agunt unde mala; ostensum mihi quales sunt et quomodo agunt, per quod innocuos adhiberent pro ministeriis persuadendi, tum per quod inducerent personas 
quod ita dixerint, cum tamen de illa re nihil dixerunt; verbo malis mediis utuntur ad finem quemcumque perveniendi; media sunt dolosa, mendacia et artificiosa; tales referunt vitia, quae vocantur 
spuria tubercula, quae innasci solent pleurae ac aliis membranis; quae ubi irradicantur, vitia late spargunt, ita ut tandem totam membranam labefactent. Tales spiritus severe puniuntur; 2 poena 
eorum est diversa a poenis aliorum; fit per circum rotationes; circumrotantur a sinistro ad dextrum, sicut orbita primum plana, quae circumrotando extuberat, dein apparet tuberositas deprimi et 
cava fieri, augetur tunc celeritas; {1}mirum quod hoc ad formam et imitamen talium tuberositatum seu apostematum. Observatum est quod in circumrotatione conati sint attrahe in suam rotam, ita in perniciem, 
alios, utplurimum insontes, ita quod illis nihil curae {2}fuerit quemcumque in perditionem trahere, dum ii perire sibi 3 videntur. Observatum etiam quod intensissimum visum habeant, in instar 
quasi pervidendo, et sic arripiendo pro mediis quae favent, ita quod sint acutiores reliquis; possunt etiam vocari ulcera mortifera, ubicumque {3}sunt in camera pectoris, ibi vel in pleura, vel 
in pericardio, vel in mediastino, vel in pulmone. Ostensum quod tales post poenam rejiciantur ad tergum in profundum, et quod ibi jaceant facie et ventre deorsum, cum pauco vitae humana perspicacia 
sua, quae fuit vitae ferinae, sic privati; infernum eorum est in profundo loco sub pede dextro paulo antrorsum. @1 et quod mirum$ @2 sit$ @3 sint$ </p>
