<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9962节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9962.</strong>“它们要在亚伦和他儿子身上”表保护，免受地狱伤害。这从“裤子”和“裸露”的含义清楚可知：“要在亚伦和他儿子身上”的“裤子”是指婚姻之爱的外在事物，或说构成婚姻之爱外层的事物（参看<a href="9959.htm">9959</a>节）；裤子所要遮掩的“裸露”是指这爱的内层事物或内在欲望，它们是污秽和地狱的，也如前所述（<a href="9960.htm">9960</a>节）。由于“裸露”具有这种含义，所以要在亚伦和他儿子身上的裤子是要保护他们免受地狱的伤害。此处的情形如下：就其内层而言，犹太和以色列民族充满对自我和世界的爱，因而充满各种地狱的爱，胜过其它一切民族；但就其外层而言，他们能处于神圣的状态，而且也胜过其它一切民族。因此，当他们处于神圣状态时，他们的内层就被关闭；因为神圣的外在事物以这种方式能通过这个民族传给天堂，他们以这种方式能与天堂联结。如果他们那污秽和地狱的内在，如前所述，没有关闭，情况就完全不同了。这就是为何他们当中没有教会，只有一个教会的代表；因为一个教会若真是一个教会，就会住在信与爱的内在事物中，而不是住在与这些事物分离的外在事物中。他们当中的外在事物都是代表。<br />由于“裤子”表示婚姻之爱的外在事物，或构成婚姻之爱的外层的事物，一般表示一切天堂之爱的外在事物，或构成一切天堂之爱的外层的事物；而遮盖内在事物或内层的，是外在事物或外层，又由于这个民族的内在事物是污秽和地狱的，所以“裤子要在亚伦和他儿子身上”表示保护，免受地狱的伤害。事实上，只要他们处于外在的神圣状态，并且他们的内在被遮盖或关闭，他们也就离地狱远了，从而得到安全的保护。犹太和以色列民族的内在是污秽和地狱的，因此他们当中没有教会，只有一个教会的代表（参看<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e，<a href="9380.htm">9380</a>节所提到的地方）；当进行敬拜时，他们仅处于外在神圣的状态（<a href="3479.htm">3479</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4311.htm">4311</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="8588.htm">8588</a>，<a href="9373.htm">9373</a>，<a href="9380.htm">9380</a>节）；在这种时候，他们的内层是关闭的（<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>节）</p>

And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons. That this signifies protection from the hells, is evident from the signification of "the breeches," of which it is said that "they shall be upon Aaron 
and his sons," as being the external things of conjugial love (see n. 9959); and from the signification of "the nakednesses" which the breeches were to cover, as being the interior things of this love, 
which were filthy and infernal (of which also above, n. 9960); and because "nakednesses" have this signification, therefore the breeches which were to be upon Aaron and upon his sons, were for protection 
from the hells. The case herein is as follows. In respect to their interiors, the Jewish and Israelitish nation was in the loves of self and of the world, thus in infernal loves, above all other 
nations; but in respect to their exteriors they could be in holiness also above all other nations; wherefore when they were in holiness, their interiors were closed; for in this way holy external things 
could be communicated through them with the heavens, and from this there could be conjunction. It would have been altogether different if the internals with them, which as above said were filthy and 
infernal, had not been closed. It is from this that with that nation there was no church, but only the representative of a church; for a church which is a church is in the internal things of faith 
and of love; but not in external things separate from these. The external things with them were all representative.  [2] As then by "breeches" are signified the external things of conjugial love, and 
in general the external things of all heavenly loves; and as external things were what covered the internal things, and as with that nation the internal things were filthy and infernal, therefore by 
"the breeches being upon Aaron and upon his sons" is signified protection from the hells; for so long as they were in a holy external, and their internals were covered or closed, so long also they were 
removed from the hells, and were thereby under protection. (That the internals with the Jewish and Israelitish nation were filthy and infernal, and that on this account there was no church with them, 
but only the representative of a church, may be seen at the places cited in n. 9320, 9380; that while they were in worship, they were only in a holy external, n. 3479, 4293, 4311, 6304, 8588, 9373, 
9380; and that their interiors were then closed, n. 8788, 8806.) </p>

'And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons' means safety from the hells. This is clear from the meaning of 'the undergarments', to which 'they shall be on Aaron and on his sons' refers, as the things 
composing the external level of conjugial love, dealt with in <a href="9959.htm">9959</a>; and from the meaning of their 'nakedness', which the undergarments were to cover, as the inner desires of that love when they are 
foul and hellish, also dealt with above in <a href="9960.htm">9960</a>. And since 'nakedness' had that meaning, the purpose of the undergarments which were on Aaron and his sons was to keep them safe from the hells. The implications 
of all this are that so far as their interiors were concerned members of the Jewish and Israelite nation were steeped in self-love and love of the world, and so in hellish kinds of love, more 
than all the other nations; but so far as their exteriors were concerned they could be in a state of holiness, again more than all the other nations. For that reason when they were in a state of holiness 
their interiors were closed off; for then through that nation outwardly holy things were communicable to the heavens, and in this way they could be linked to heaven. It would have been altogether 
different if their internals, which were foul and hellish, as has been stated, had not been closed off. This is why no Church existed among them, only what was representative of the Church; for a Church 
that is indeed a Church resides in things of an internal nature, which are those of faith and love, not in those of an external nature separated from them. The things of an external nature among 
them were all representative.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since then things composing the external level of conjugial love - and in general those composing the external levels of all heavenly kinds of love - are meant by 
'the undergarments', and since external levels were what covered internal ones, and since the internals with that nation were foul and hellish, the declaration that the undergarments should be on Aaron 
and on his sons means safety from the hells. For, as long as they were in a state of outward holiness, their internals having been covered or closed off, they were also remote from the hells and consequently 
in safety.  </p>
<p>Internals with the Jewish and Israelite nation were foul and hellish, therefore no Church existed among them, only a representative of the Church, see the places referred to 
in <a href="9320.htm">9320</a> (end), <a href="9380.htm">9380</a>.  When engaged in worship they were in a state of solely outward holiness, <a href="3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4311.htm">4311</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>, <a href="8588.htm">8588</a>, <a href="9373.htm">9373</a>, <a href="9380.htm">9380</a>.

`Et erunt super Aharone et super filiis ejus': quod significet tutelam ab infernis, constat a significatione `femoralium' de quibus dicitur quod `erunt super Aharone et filiis ejus' quod sint externa 
amoris conjugialis, de qua n. 9959, et ex significatione `nuditatum, quas femoralia tegerent' quod sint interiora {1}ejus, quae spurca et infernalia, de qua etiam supra n. 9560; et quia `nuditates' 
ea significabant, ideo `femoralia quae super Aharone et super filiis ejus' erant pro tutela ab infernis; cum his ita se habet: gens Judaica et Israelitica quoad interiora sua erant in amoribus sui et 
mundi, ita in amoribus infernalibus prae reliquis gentibus, sed quoad exteriora potuerunt esse in sancto etiam (x)prae reliquis gentibus; quapropter cum in sancto erant occludebantur illis interiora, 
sic enim per illos potuerunt sancta {2}externa communicari cum caelis, et inde existere conjunctio; aliter prorsus si non occlusa fuissent apud illos interna, quae erant, ut dictum, spurca et infernalia; 
inde est quod apud illos non fuerit Ecclesia sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, Ecclesia enim quae Ecclesia, est in internis, quae sunt fidei et amoris, non autem in externis separatis ab illis; 
externa apud illos erant omnia {3}repraesentativa. 	2 Quia nunc per `femoralia' significantur externa amoris conjugialis, in genere externa omnium amorum caelestium, et externa erant quae tegebant interna, 
{4}ac interna apud illos erant spurca et infernalia, ideo per quod `femoralia (x)essent super Aharone et super filiis ejus' significatur tutela ab infernis; quamdiu enim in externo sancto erant, 
tectis seu occlusis internis, tamdiu etiam remoti erant ab infernis, (c)et sic in tutela. {5}Quod interna apud gentem Judaicam et Israeliticam fuerint spurca et infernalia, et quod ideo non Ecclesia 
apud illos fuerit, sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, videantur loca citata n. 9320 fin. et n. 9380; quod cum in cultu, fuerint solum in sancto externo, {6} n. 3479, 4293, 4311, 6304, 8588, 9373, 
(x)9380, et quod {7}interiora tunc (m)fuerint occlusa, n. 8788, 8806.(n) @1 illius amoris$ @2 in externis$ @3 cultus repraesentativi$ @4 quae$ @5 Quod gens Judaica et Israelitica in sancto externo
