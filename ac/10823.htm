<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10823节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10823</strong>.每个人都从自己的父亲那里获得其生命的存在或核心，这生命的存在或核心被称为他的灵魂；源于它的生命显现被称为身体。因此，身体是其灵魂的样子，因为通过身体，灵魂可以随心所欲地过自己的生活。这解释了为何人们生来就像自己的父亲，为何各个家庭彼此有别。由此明显可知主的身体或人身本质上是什么样，即它就像神性本身，也就是祂生命的存在或核心，或来自父的灵魂。这就是为何祂说：<br />人看见了我，就是看见了父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">14:9</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10823</b></p><p><b>10823.</b>
Every man has from his father his being of life, which is called his soul. The derivative manifestation [existere] of life is that which is called the body. Consequently the body is the likeness of its 
soul, because by means of it the soul pursues its life at its pleasure. From this it is that men are born into the likeness of their fathers, and that families are distinguished from each other. And 
from this it is evident what was the nature of the Lord's body or Human, namely, that it was like the Divine Itself, which was the Being of His life, or the Soul from the Father; and He therefore said: </p>
<p> 
    He that seeth Me seeth the Father (John 14:9). </p>

Every person receives his core (esse) of life from his father, which is called his soul; and from this springs the manifestation of life, which is called the body. Consequently the body resembles its 
soul, for it is through the body, acting at the soul's behest, that the soul leads its life. This explains why people are born resembling their fathers, and why families are distinguishable from one 
another. From all this it is evident what the Lord's body, or rather His Human, was like essentially, namely like the Divine itself, which was the Core (Esse) of His life, that is, was the soul from the 
Father. This was why He said,  </p>

</p><b>10823.</b>
Omnis homo ex patre habet suum esse vitae, quod vocatur anima ejus; existere vitae inde est, quod vocatur corpus; inde corpus est similitudo suae animae, nam anima per illud agit vitam suam ex nutu; 
inde est quod homines nascantur in similitudinem suorum patrum, et quod familiae internoscantur; exinde patet quale corpus seu quale Humanum Domino fuit, quod nempe sicut ipsum Divinum, quod fuit Esse 
vitae Ipsius seu anima (c)ex Patre, quare dixit, 	Qui videt Me videt Patrem, Joh. xiv 9. </p>
