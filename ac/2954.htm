<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2954节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2954.</strong>“我要把那田的价银给你，求你收下”表来自主的教会真理方面的救赎。这从“给价银”、“田”和“收下”的含义清楚可知：“给价银”是指凭真理救赎（参看<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>节），因为“银”表真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）；“田”是指教会，以及真理的教义（参看<a href="368.htm">368</a>，<a href="2936.htm">2936</a>节）；“收下”是指那些属于该教会之人的积极回应，这种回应包含一种信仰，即救赎唯独来自主。至于救赎，它和改造、重生一样，因此是指从地狱被解救出来，从而得救。属灵教会成员的救赎，或改造与得救是通过真理实现的，而属天教会成员的救赎，或改造与得救是通过良善实现的。<br />其原因在前面已反复说明，也就是说，属灵之人没有丝毫良善的意愿；不过，他们被赋予理解何为良善的能力。对良善的理解主要被称为真理，事实上就是信之真理；而对良善的意愿并由此行善被称为良善。因此，属灵之人通过对良善的理解，或也可说，通过真理被引入对良善的意愿，或也可说，被引入良善。然而，他们通过自己的东西并不能被引入对良善的任何意愿，因为他们已丧失一切良善的意愿（参看<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="2124.htm">2124</a>节）。相反，他们被引入从主所接受的一个新意愿（<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>节）；当接受这个新意愿时，他们就特被称为赎民（the redeemed）。</p>

I will give the silver of the field; take it of me. That this signifies redemption as to the truths of the church which are from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "giving silver," as being 
to redeem by truth (see above, n. 2937); for "silver" is truth (n. 1551); from the signification of "field," as being the church, and also the doctrine of truth (see n. 368, 2936); and from the signification 
of "taking of me," as being what is reciprocal with those who are of the church; the reciprocal is faith that redemption is from the Lord alone. As regards redemption, it is the same as reformation 
and regeneration and the consequent deliverance from hell and salvation. The redemption or reformation and salvation of the men of the spiritual church is effected through truth; but that of 
the men of the celestial church through good. The reasons have been repeatedly stated above, namely, that the spiritual have nothing of the will of good, but in its stead have been gifted with the faculty 
of understanding what is good. The understanding of good is what is principally called truth, and indeed the truth of faith; but willing and thence doing this is what is called good. The spiritual 
therefore, through the understanding of good, or what is the same, through truth, are introduced into the will of good, or what is the same, into good; not however into anything of the will of good 
from themselves, for with them all the will of good has been lost (see n. 895, 927, 2124); but into a new will which they receive from the Lord (n. 863, 875, 1023, 1043, 1044); and when they have received 
this will they are then called specifically the redeemed. </p>

'I will give the price of the field, accept it from me' means redemption as regards the truths of the Church which come from the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'giving the silver' as redeeming 
by means of truth, dealt with above in <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, for 'silver' means truth, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>; from the meaning of 'the field' as the Church, and also the doctrine of truth, dealt with in <a href="368.htm">368</a>, <a href="2936.htm">2936</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'accept it from me' as a willing response with those who belong to the Church. That response involves a belief that redemption comes from the Lord alone. As for what redemption is, it is the same 
as reformation and regeneration, and therefore being delivered from hell and being saved. The redemption, or reformation and salvation, of members of the spiritual Church is effected by means of truth, 
whereas that of members of the celestial Church is effected by means of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reasons why have been stated in various places already - that spiritual people possess no will at all for 
what is good, but instead have been provided with an ability to understand what good is. The understanding of what is good is primarily called truth, and indeed the truth of faith, while the willing 
of it and from this the doing of it is called good. Spiritual persons therefore, by means of an understanding of good, or what amounts to the same, by means of truth, are led on to a will for what is 
good, or what amounts to the same, to good. They are not led on to any will for what is good from anything that is their own, since all will for what is good has with them been destroyed, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="2124.htm">2124</a>. 
Instead they are led on to a new will which they receive from the Lord, <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>; and when they have received this new will they specifically are called the redeemed. </p>

`Dabo argentum agri, accipe a me':  quod significet redemptionem quoad vera Ecclesiae quae a Domino, constat ex significatione `dare argentum' quod sit redimere per verum, de qua supra n. 2937, `argentum' 
enim est verum, n. 1551; a significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia, tum doctrina veri, de qua n. 368, 2936; et a significatione `accipere a me' quod sit reciprocum apud illos qui ab Ecclesia; reciprocum 
est fides quod redemptio sit a solo Domino.  Quod redemptionem attinet, est illa idem ac reformatio et regeneratio, et inde liberatio ab inferno et salvatio; redemptio seu reformatio et {1}salvatio 
hominum Ecclesiae spiritualis fit per verum, at hominum Ecclesiae caelestis per bonum; [2] causae prius passim dictae sunt, nempe quod spirituales nihil voluntatis boni habeant, sed pro illa donati 
facultate intelligendi quid bonum; intellectus boni est qui principaliter vocatur verum, et quidem verum fidei, at velle illud et inde facere illud est quod vocatur bonum; spirituales itaque per 
intellectum boni, seu quod idem, per verum, introducuntur in voluntatem boni, seu quod idem, in bonum, sed non in aliquid voluntatis boni ex semetipsis, quia voluntas boni apud eos omnis deperdita est, 
n. 895, 927, 2124; sed in voluntatem novam quam accipiunt a Domino, n. 863, 875, 1023, 1043, 1044; et cum hanc voluntatem acceperint, tunc in specie dicuntur redempti. @1 regeneratio$  </p>
