<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第221节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>221.</strong>“天起凉风之日”，表教会尚存有一丝觉知的时期，这从“日”与“夜”的含义可知。上古之人将教会的状态比作日间或夜间的时辰，当教会仍处于光明时，便将它比作日间的时辰。这种状态被比作“天起凉风之日”，因为他们尚留有一丝觉知，藉此，他们知道自己已经堕落。<br />主同样将有信的状态比作“日”，将无信的状态比作“夜”，例如：“趁着白日，我必须作那差我来者的工。黑夜将到，就没有人能作工了。”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.4.htm">9:4</a>）在第一章，重生之人的各种状态也因此被称作“日”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]221.</strong> The symbolism of the breeze of the day{*1} as an era when the church still retained a trace of perception can be seen from the symbolism of day and night. The earliest people compared the phases of the church to the times of day and night, the day times being a comparison for phases in which the church still enjoyed light. So the breeze of the day is being used as the comparison for a stage at which the church kept some residual perception, allowing them to recognize that they had slipped.<br />The Lord also uses day as the term for a state of faith and night as the term for a state lacking in faith. An example in John:<br />I have to do the work of him who sent me while it is still day. The night, in which no one can work, is coming. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_221/bible_king-james-version_john_9_4" target=_top>John 9:4</a>)<br />The stages of a person's regeneration are therefore called days in the first chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "The breeze of the day" here is, in Latin, per auram seu spiritum diei — literally, "in the breeze, or the spirit, of the day." Swedenborg is trying to reflect two different nuances of the Hebrew רוּחַ (rûaḥ), which means both "wind" and "spirit." See also note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_221/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_96" target=_top>96</a>. [RS] </p>

That by the "air" or "breath" "of the day" is signified a period when the church had still somewhat of perception remaining, is evident from the signification of "day" and of "night." The most ancient 
people compared the states of the church to the times of the day and of the night, to the times of the day when the church was still in light, wherefore this state is compared to the breath or air "of 
the day" because there was still some remnant of perception by which they knew that they were fallen. The Lord also calls the state of faith "day" and that of no faith "night;" as in John: </p>
<p>     I 
must work the works of Him that sent Me, while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work (John 9:4). The states of the regeneration of man were for the same reason called "days" in chapter 1. </p>

'Breeze, or breath,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the daytime' means a time when the Church still had a residue of perception. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'day' and of 'night'. The most ancient people compared states 
of the Church to the times of the day and of the night. States when the Church still had light they compared to times of the day; therefore this verse speaks of 'the breath' or breeze of the daytime' 
as when they still had some residue of perception, from which they knew that they were fallen. The Lord too calls a state in which there is faith 'the daytime' and one in which there is none 'the night', 
as in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when nobody will be able to work. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The consecutive states of man's regeneration for the same 
reason were called 'days' in Chapter <a href="1.htm">1</a>.

</p><b>221.</b>
Quod per 'auram (seu spiritum){1} diei' significetur tempus cum adhuc Ecclesia residuum haberet de perceptione, constare potest a significatione 'diei et noctis.' Antiquissimi status Ecclesiae comparabant 
temporibus diei et noctis; temporibus diei adhuc esset in luce, quare hic 'spiritui seu aurae diei,' cum aliquid residuum perceptionis haberent, ex quo noverunt quod lapsi: Dominus etiam statum 
fidei appellat 'diem,' et statum nullius fidei 'noctem,' ut apud Johannem, 	Me oportet operari opera Ipsius, Qui misit Me, quousque dies est; venit nox, quando nemo poterit operari, ix {x}4. Status 
regenerationis hominis in capite primo ideo dicti sunt 'dies.' @1 I has no parentheses.$
