<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4710节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4710.</strong>“你来，我要打发你往他们那里去”表它要教导神性属灵良善。这从“约瑟”的代表清楚可知，“约瑟”是指主的神性属灵层（<a href="4669.htm">4669</a>，<a href="4708.htm">4708</a>节）。当说“打发”这属灵层时，它表示教导神性属灵良善。就内义而言，“打发”（或差遣）是指出来并发出（<a href="2397.htm">2397</a>节），同时也指教导；故在此是指教导从主的神性属灵层发出的神性属灵良善。神性属灵良善就是爱与仁的属性；而神性属灵真理是源于爱与仁之信的属性。凡教导这些良善的人也教导这些真理，因为这些真理源于并涉及这些良善。就内义而言，“打发”（或差遣）表示发出并教导，这一事实从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。如经上论及主时经常所说的，祂被父“差遣”，以此表示祂从父，也就是从神性良善发出；还有主“差遣”保惠师，或真理的圣灵，以此表示神圣真理从祂发出。先知也被“差遣”，以此表示他们教导从主发出之物。谁都能从圣言确认这些事，因为它们在那里频繁出现。</p>

Come, and I will send thee unto them. That this signifies that it should teach Divine spiritual goods, is evident from the representation of Joseph as being the Lord's Divine spiritual (n. 4669, 4708). 
When this is said to be "sent," it denotes to teach Divine spiritual goods; for in the internal sense "to be sent" is to go forth and to proceed (n. 2397), and also at the same time to teach; here 
therefore it is to teach the Divine spiritual goods which proceed from the Lord's Divine spiritual. Divine spiritual goods are those which are of love and charity; but Divine spiritual truths are those 
which are of the faith thence. One who teaches the former, teaches also the latter; for the latter are from the former and concerning them. That in the internal sense "to be sent" is to proceed and 
to teach, is evident from many passages in the Word, as where it is often said of the Lord that He was "sent" by the Father, whereby is signified that He proceeded from Him, that is, from the Divine good; 
and also that the Lord "sends" the Comforter, or the Spirit of Truth, whereby is signified that holy truth proceeds from Him. The prophets also were "sent," by which is signified that they taught 
what proceeds from the Lord. Everyone may confirm these things from the Word, where they often occur. </p>

'Go, and I will send you to them' means that it would teach Divine spiritual forms of good. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph' as the Lord's Divine Spiritual, dealt with in <a href="4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="4708.htm">4708</a>. 
When this Spiritual is said 'to be sent', the teaching of Divine spiritual forms of good is meant. In the internal sense 'being sent' means coming out and going forth, <a href="2397.htm">2397</a>, and also at the same time 
means teaching; here therefore Divine spiritual forms of good which go forth from the Lord's Divine Spiritual are meant Divine spiritual forms of good are attributes of love and charity, whereas Divine 
spiritual truths are attributes of faith derived from love and charity. Anyone who teaches those forms of good also teaches these truths, for these truths derive from and have reference to those forms 
of good. The fact that 'being sent' means going forth and teaching may be seen from many places in the Word. It may be seen in the phrase used many times, that the Lord 'was sent from the Father', 
meaning that He came forth from Him, that is, from Divine Good It may also be seen in references to the Lord sending the Paraclete or the Spirit of truth, meaning that holy truth goes forth from Him. 
The prophets too 'were sent', and by this is meant that they were to teach that which goes forth from the Lord. Anyone may confirm these matters from the Word, for they occur frequently there. </p>

`Vade et mittam te ad illos': quod significet quod doceret Divina bona spiritualia, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit Divinum Spirituale Domini, de qua n. 4669, 4708; cum `mitti' hoc 
dicitur, est docere Divina bona spiritualia, nam `mitti' in sensu interno est exire et procedere, n. 2397, et quoque simul docere, hic itaque Divina bona spiritualia quae procedunt a Divino Spirituali 
Domini; Divina bona spiritualia sunt illa quae sunt amoris et charitatis, Divina autem vera spiritualia sunt illa quae sunt fidei inde; qui illa docet, haec etiam docet, nam haec sunt ex illis 
et de illis; quod `mitti' in sensu interno sit procedere et docere, constare potest a multis locis in Verbo, ut pluries de Domino quod `missus a Patre', quo significatur quod procederet ab Ipso, hoc 
est, a Divino Bono; et quoque quod `Dominus mittat paracletum' seu spiritum veritatis, quo significatur quod sanctum verum procedat ab Ipso: et quoque prophetae mittebantur {1}, et per id significatur 
quod docerent illud quod procedit a Domino; haec confirmare ex Verbo quilibet potest, frequenter enim ibi legitur.      @1 dicebantur missi$ </p>
