<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3620节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3620.</strong>“我因这赫人的女子，连性命都厌烦了”表与来自其它源头的属世真理的联系。这从“厌烦性命”和“赫人的女子”的含义清楚可知：“厌烦性命”是指没有联系，也就是说，属世层的真理与理性层的真理没有联系，因为当这二者彼此没有联系时，在理性层看来，它自己的生命看似不是生命，这从前面所述（<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>节）可以看出来；“赫人的女子”是指对出自非纯正源头真理的情感，在此是指对属世真理的情感，因为利百加这话是对雅各说的，而雅各代表属世真理，如前所示。“女子或女儿”表情感（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）；“赫”或“赫人”表出自非纯正源头的真理（<a href="3470.htm">3470</a>节）。从这些含义清楚可知，“我因这赫人的女子，连性命都厌烦了”表示不可能有经由并非出自纯正源头的真理而与属世层的任何联系，因而表示与来自其它源头的属世真理的联系必不存在。与属世真理的这种联系就是下文所论述的，即提及雅各与拉班同住的地方，也就是说，来自共同家族的真理被联结到它上面。由于“赫人的女子”所代表的真理并非出自那共同家族，故它们与属世真理不可能有任何联系，因为它们不一样并且不一致。实际上，“赫人”代表外邦人当中的属灵教会（<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>，<a href="2986.htm">2986</a>节）；但由于这教会没有圣言，所以圣言不是该教会真理的源头。</p>

I loathe my life because of the daughters of Heth. That this signifies the adjunction of natural truth from another source, is evident from the signification of "loathing one's life," as being no adjunction, 
namely, of natural truth to the truth of the rational, for when there is not adjunction, then to the rational its life appears as if it were no life, as may be seen from what was said above (n. 
3493); and from the signification of the "daughters of Heth," as being the affections of truth from what is not genuine; here, the affections of natural truth, because spoken of Jacob, by whom natural 
truth is represented, as before shown. (That "daughters" are affections may be seen above, n. 2362; and that "Heth" or "Hittite" is truth from what is not genuine, n. 3470.) Hence it is evident that 
by "I loathe my life because of the daughters of Heth," is signified that there could be no adjunction of the natural through truth which is not from what is genuine; thus that there must be the adjunction 
of natural truth from another source.  The adjunction of natural truth is treated of in what follows, where mention is made of Jacob's stay with Laban, namely, that truths from a common stock 
were adjoined thereto; and by the truths which the daughters of Heth represent, because they were not from that stock, no adjunction could be effected, since there was disparity and discordance; for 
by the sons of Heth is represented the spiritual church among the Gentiles (n. 2913, 2986), in which, as they have not the Word, the truths are not from that origin. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3620</b></p><p><b>3620.</b>
'I loathe my life on account of the daughters of Heth' means a connection with natural truth from some other source. This is clear from the meaning of 'loathing one's life' as no connection, that is 
to say, of the truth of the natural with the truth of the rational - for when these two are not connected to each other it seems to the rational as though its own life were no life, as may be seen from 
what has been stated above in <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>; and from the meaning of 'the daughters of Heth' as affections for truth from a non-genuine source, in this case affections for natural truth, since Rebekah said this 
to Jacob who, as shown above, represents natural truth. For 'the daughters' means affections, see <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, and 'Heth' or Hittite truth from a non-genuine source, <a href="3470.htm">3470</a>. From these meanings it is clear 
that 'I loathe my life on account of the daughters of Heth' means that there should not be any connection with the natural through truth which does not come from a genuine source, thus that no connection 
with natural truth from some other source should exist. The connection with natural truth is dealt with later on where Jacob's stay with Laban is the subject - that is to say, when truths from a 
common stem have been joined on to it. Since the truths which 'the daughters of Heth' represent did not come from that common stem no connection of them with natural truth was possible, because they were 
dissimilar and did not accord with it. Actually the spiritual Church among gentiles, <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>, <a href="2956.htm">2956</a>, is represented by 'the sons of Heth', but as the Word does not exist in that Church the Word is not 
the source of its truths. </p>

`Fastidio vitam meam pro filiabus Heth': quod significet adjunctionem veri naturalis aliunde, constat ex significatione `fastidire vitam' quod sit nulla adjunctio, nempe veri naturalis ad verum rationalis, 
cum enim non est adjunctio, tunc apparet rationali vita sua, sicut nulla, ut constare potest (c)ab illis [quae supra] n, 3493 dicta sunt; et ex significatione `filiarum Heth' quod sint affectiones 
veri ex non genuino, hic veri naturalis quia de Jacobo dicitur, per quem quod verum naturale repraesentetur, supra ostensum est; quod `filiae' sint affectiones, videatur n. 2362; et quod Heth seu 
Hittaeus sit verum ex non genuino, n. 3470; inde constat (x)quod per `fastidio vitam meam pro filiabus Heth' significetur quod nulla adjunctio naturalis per verum quod non ex genuino, ita quod {1}erit 
adjunctio veri naturalis aliunde: de adjunctione veri naturalis in sequentibus ubi de commoratione Jacobi apud Labanem agitur, quod nempe adjuncta sint ei vera e communi stirpe; {2}et per vera quae repraesentant 
`filiae Heth,' quia non erant ex illa stirpe, non potuit fieri adjunctio quia disparia et discordantia; per `filios enim Heth' repraesentatur Ecclesia spiritualis apud gentes, n. 2913, 2986,
