<p><strong>[NCE]351.</strong> Abel has already been shown to symbolize charity [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_351/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_342" target=_top>342-343</a>]. Charity means love for our neighbor. It means mercy too, since if we love our neighbors as we do ourselves we have mercy on them when they are suffering, as we would on ourselves. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 351</b></p><p><b>351.</b>
That "Abel" signifies charity has been shown before. By charity is meant love toward the neighbor, and mercy; for he who loves his neighbor as himself is also compassionate toward him in his sufferings, 
as toward himself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 351</b></p><p><b>351.</b>
That 'Abel' means charity has been shown already. Charity means love towards the neighbour and compassion, for anyone who loves his neighbour as himself also has as much compassion for him in his suffering 
as he does for himself in his own.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 351</b>
</p><b>351.</b>
Quod 'Habel' significet charitatem, prius ostensum est Charitas significat amorem erga proximum et misericordiam; qui enim amat proximum ut se ipsum, etiam ejus miseretur, cum patitur sicut ipse sui. </p>
