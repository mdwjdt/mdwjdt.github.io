<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1627.</strong> 除了城市和宫殿，我偶尔还被允许参观那里的装饰品，如楼梯和门的。这些装饰品充满动感，仿佛是活的，并且不断变化，展现出新的美和对称性。我被告知，这样的变化能以此方式不断继续下去，直到永远，并永远伴随新的和谐，和形成和谐的一系列变化。我还被告知，这些只是一些最不起眼的事物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1627.</strong> In addition to cities and mansions, I was sometimes able to see decorative elements, such as those that appear on stairways and main doors. These elements moved as if they were alive, and changed with ever fresh beauty and symmetry. I learned that such changes can keep going indefinitely, one after another, even to eternity, and there is a constantly renewed harmony among the variations, formed by the very sequence of changes itself. These were only the least of their wonders, I heard. </p>

Besides the cities and palaces, I have sometimes been permitted to see their decorations, such as those of the steps and of the gates and these were moving as if alive, and continually changing, with 
a beauty and symmetry ever new. And I have been informed that the variations may thus succeed each other perpetually, even if it were to be to eternity, with new harmony continually, the succession itself 
also forming a harmony. And I have been told that these were among the very little things. </p>

In addition to the cities and palaces, I have also on occasions been allowed to see the decorative work there, such as that of stairways and of doors. These decorations are full of movement, as though 
they were living, and constantly change to reveal new beauty and symmetry. I have been told that such variations can continue in this fashion, even for ever, with a harmony for ever new, and with the 
very succession of variations forming a harmony as well. I was also told that these were merely some of the least significant things. </p>

</p><b>1627.</b>
Praeter urbes et palatia, etiam quandoque decoramenta mihi videre datum, ut quae sunt graduum et portarum, et illa se moventia sicut viva et se variantia cum nova semper pulchritudine et symmetria; 
et informatus quod ita perenniter succedere possint variationes, si vel foret in aeternum, cum nova harmonia continue, ipsa successione etiam harmoniam formante; et dictum quod haec essent inter minima. </p>
