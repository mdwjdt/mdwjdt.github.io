<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3471节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3471.</strong>“她们使以撒和利百加灵里苦闷”表悲伤最初来自这个源头。这从“灵里苦闷”的含义，以及“以撒和利百加”的代表清楚可知：“灵里苦闷”是指悲伤；“以撒和利百加”是指主的神圣理性的神圣良善和神圣真理。因为就至高意义而言，此处所论述的主题是主；而就代表意义而言，主题是那些为祂的形像和样式的人。也就是说，至高意义描述了主如何使祂自己里面的人性变成神性；代表意义则描述了主如何使人重生，或使他变得属天、属灵。人的重生就是主荣耀的形像（参看<a href="3043.htm">3043</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>节）。<br />一开始有悲伤的原因是，当真理嵌入属世良善时，它们一开始会引起悲伤，因为它们压制良知，引发焦虑，这是由于欲望的存在，属灵真理与它们发生冲突。不过，这最初的悲伤会逐渐减轻，最终消失。这就像是虚弱的病体，它要恢复健康，就不得不经历痛苦的治疗。而在这种情况下，它首先遭受痛苦和悲伤。</p>

And they were bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah. That this signifies that from this source there at first came grief, is evident from the signification of "bitterness of spirit," as being 
grief; and from the representation of Isaac and Rebekah, as being the Lord's Divine rational as to Divine good and Divine truth; for in the supreme sense the Lord is the subject here treated of; but in 
the representative sense, those who are likenesses or images of Him; that is, in the supreme sense it is shown how the Lord made the Human in Himself Divine; and in the representative sense how the 
Lord regenerates man, that is, makes him celestial and spiritual.  That the regeneration of man is an image of the Lord's glorification, may be seen above (n. 3043, 3138, 3212, 3296). The reason why 
there was grief at first, is that when truths are being inserted into natural good, they at first cause pain, for they oppress the conscience, and induce anxieties, because there are concupiscences present, 
against which spiritual truth combats; but this first grief by degrees diminishes, and at last vanishes away. It is as with a weak and sickly body, which is to be restored to health by painful 
means; in this state, at first it has grief. </p>

'They were a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah' means that this led at first to grief. This is clear from the meaning of 'bitterness of spirit' as grief, and from the representation of 'Isaac 
and Rebekah' as the Lord's Divine Rational as regards Divine Good and Divine Truth. For in the highest sense the Lord is the subject, but in the representative sense those who are likenesses and images 
of Him. That is to say, the highest sense describes how the Lord made His own Human Divine, the representative how the Lord regenerates man, or makes him celestial and spiritual. As regards man's regeneration 
being the image of the Lord's glorification, see <a href="3043.htm">3043</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why there was grief at first is that when truths are brought into association with natural good they 
give rise to grief initially since they weigh down the conscience and cause feelings of anxiety owing to the presence of cravings with which spiritual truth conflicts. But this initial grief lessens 
gradually and at length disappears. It is like the body, when feeble and ill, having to be restored to health by painful remedies. While in that condition it at first suffers pain and grief. </p>

Quod `fuerunt amaritudo spiritus Jishako et Rebeccae' significet quod inde primum dolor, constat ex significatione `amaritudinis spiritus' quod sit dolor; et ex repraesentatione `Jishak et Rebeccae' 
quod sit Divinum Rationale Domini quoad Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum; in supremo enim sensu agitur de Domino, at in repraesentativo de illis qui sunt similitudines aut imagines Ipsius, nempe in supremo 
sensu quomodo Dominus Humanum apud Se Divinum fecit, in repraesentativo quomodo Dominus hominem regenerat, seu caelestem et spiritualem facit; quod regeneratio hominis sit imago glorificationis Domini, 
videatur n. 3043, 3138, 3212, 3296. [2] Quod dolor fuerit primum, inde est quia cum vera inferuntur bono naturali, primo dolorem faciant, aggravant enim conscientiam et inducunt anxietates, quia 
concupiscentiae adsunt contra quas verum spirituale {1}pugnat; sed dolor hic primus per gradus diminuitur et tandem evanescit; est sicut invalidum et aegrotum corpus, quod per dolorifica sanitati restituendum; 
cum in statu illo est, tunc ei primum {2}dolor. @1 before verum$  @2 i est$  </p>
