<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4564节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4564.</strong>“就葬在伯特利下边橡树底下”表永远弃绝。这从“（被）葬”和“橡树底下”的含义清楚可知：“（被）葬”是指被弃绝和，因为被葬之物被弃绝；“橡树底下”是指永远（参看<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>节）。“橡树底下”表示在属世层之外，因为被说成在底下或下边之物在内义上是指在……之外（参看<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>节）。“伯特利”是指神性属世层（<a href="4089.htm">4089</a>，<a href="4539.htm">4539</a>节）。<br />此中情形乃是这样：在正重生的人里面，无论遗传邪恶还是人所行的实际邪恶，都不会被根除到消失或清除的程度，只是被分离出去，并通过主的重新安排而被丢到最外边（<a href="4551.htm">4551</a>，<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>节）。因此，它依旧留在这个人身上，甚至直到永远；但他会被主从邪恶当中拦阻，并被保守在良善中。当这种情况发生时，邪恶看似被丢弃，此人从它们当中得以洁净，或如人们所说的，“称义”了。天上的所有天使都承认，就他们而言，越是源于他们自己的事物，就越完全是邪恶及其衍生的虚假；相反，越是源于主的事物，就越是良善及其衍生的真理。<br />人若在这个问题上吸收了任何其它观点，并且活在世上时出于自己的教义确认这一观念：他们已经称义，在这种情况下是没有罪的，因而是神圣的，就被带回他们的邪恶状态，既有他们自己所行的邪恶，也有通过遗传所得来的邪恶。那时，他们被保持在这种状态，直到他们通过活生生地经历知道，凭他们自己，他们无非是邪恶，在他们看来似乎是他们自己的良善其实出自主，因而不是他们的，而是主的。这就是天使的情况，也是世人当中重生之人的情况。<br />但主的情况则不然。祂将来自母亲的一切遗传邪恶完全从自己那里清理、逐出并丢了出去。事实上，祂因从耶和华成孕，故没有通过遗传来自祂父亲的邪恶，只有来自母亲的邪恶。这就是区别；这就是主变成公义，神圣本身和神性的意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4564</b></p><p><b>4564.</b>
And she was buried from under Bethel under the oak. That this signifies that it was rejected forever, is evident from the signification of "being buried," as being to be rejected, for what is buried 
is rejected; and from the signification of "under the oak," as being forever (see above, n. 4552). "From under Bethel" signifies outside of the natural, for what is said to be underneath, or below, in 
the internal sense is without (see n. 2148). "Bethel" is the Divine natural (n. 4089, 4539).  [2] The case herein is this. Evil both hereditary and actual in a man who is being regenerated is not exterminated 
so as to vanish or become null and void, but is only separated, and by the Lord's disposal is rejected to the circumferences (n. 4551, 4552); and it remains so with the man even to eternity; 
but he is withheld by the Lord from the evil and is kept in good. When this takes place it appears as if evils were cast away and the man purified from them, or as is said, "justified." All the angels 
of heaven confess that with them, insofar as it is of themselves, there is nothing but evil and its derivative falsity; but insofar as it is from the Lord, there is good and the derivative truth. [3] 
They who have conceived any other opinion on this subject, and have while living in the world confirmed themselves from their doctrine in the idea that they had been justified and were then without 
sins, thus that they are holy, are remitted into the state of their evils, both from what is actual and from what is hereditary, and are kept in this state until they know by living experience that 
of themselves they are nothing but evil, and that the good in which they had seemed to themselves to be, was from the Lord, consequently is not theirs, but the Lord's. Such is the case with the angels, 
and such also is it with the regenerate among men. [4] But with the Lord it was otherwise. All the hereditary evil from the mother He altogether removed from Himself, expelled, and cast out. For He 
had no evil by inheritance from His Father, because He was conceived of Jehovah, but only from the mother. This is the difference; and this is what is meant by the Lord's being made righteousness, the 
Holy itself, and the Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4564</b></p><p><b>4564.</b>
'And was buried below Bethel under an oak' means cast away for ever. This is clear from the meaning of 'being buried' as being cast away, for that which is buried is cast away; and from the meaning of 
'under an oak' as for ever, dealt with above in <a href="4552.htm">4552</a>. 'Below Bethel' means outside the natural, for that which is said to be beneath or below is in the internal sense outside, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>; 'Bethel' is the 
Divine Natural <a href="4089.htm">4089</a>, <a href="4539.htm">4539</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implication of this is that with a person who is being regenerated,  neither hereditary evil nor that of his own doing is removed in such a way as to disappear or 
be eliminated, but is merely separated and through the  rearrangement effected by the Lord is cast away to the most outlying parts, <a href="4551.htm">4551</a>, <a href="4552.htm">4552</a>. It accordingly remains with that person, and does so 
for ever, but he is withheld from evil by the Lord and maintained in good. When this happens it seems as though evils have been cast away and the person has been purified from them or, as it is said, 
made righteous. All the angels of heaven confess that in their case, insofar as anything originates in themselves it is entirely evil and consequently false, but insofar as it originates in the Lord it 
is good and consequently true. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 People who have adopted any other notion concerning this matter, and who from the teaching they received while living in the world have become convinced that they 
have been made righteous and are in that case without sins, and so are holy, are taken back to the state where their evils reigned - both those of their own doing and those received through heredity. 
They are then kept in that state until they know from personal experience that of themselves they are nothing but evil and the good which had seemed to them to be their own came from the Lord, and 
that therefore it was not theirs but the Lord's. This is the situation with angels, as it is with the regenerate among men. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But in the Lord's case it was different. He entirely removed, cast out, 
and cast away from Himself all hereditary evil from His mother, for being conceived from Jehovah He had no evil by heredity from His Father, only from His Mother. This is the difference; and this is 
what is meant by the Lord's being made Righteousness, the Holy itself, and the Divine. </p>

`Et sepeliebatur desubter Bethel sub quercu': quod significet rejectum in perpetuum, constat a significatione `sepeliri' quod sit rejici {1}, nam quod sepelitur, hoc rejicitur; </p>
<p>et a significatione 
`sub quercu' quod sit in perpetuum, de qua supra n. 4552; `desubter Bethel' significat extra naturale, nam quod dicitur subter seu infra, hoc in sensu interno est extra, n. 2148; (o)Bethel est Divinum 
Naturale, n. 4089, 4539.  [2] Cum hoc se ita habet: malum {2} tam hereditarium quam actuale apud hominem qui regeneratur, non exterminatur ita ut evanescat aut nullum fiat, sed modo separatur, 
et per dispositionem a Domino rejicitur in {3} peripherias, n. 4551, 4552, ita manet apud illum, et hoc in aeternum, verum detinetur a Domino ac tenetur in bono; cum {4} hoc fit, tunc apparet sicut 
mala rejecta sint, et sic {5} homo ab illis purificatus, seu ut aiunt, justificatus; omnes angeli caeli fatentur {6} quod apud illos quantum ex se, non sit nisi malum {7} et inde falsum, sed quantum 
a Domino, sit bonum et inde verum; [3] qui de illa re aliam opinionem captarunt, et ex doctrinali suo cum vixerunt in mundo, apud se confirmarunt quod justificati sint et tunc absque Peccatis, 
et sic quod sancti, illi remittuntur in statum malorum ex actuali et hereditario, et in (c)illo tenentur usque dum per vivam experientiam sciunt {8} quod a se non nisi quam malum sint, et quod bonum 
in quo sibi visi {9} fuerant, esset a Domino, proinde quod non esset illorum sed Domini; ita se habet cum angelis, ac ita cum regeneratis inter homines; [4] at cum Domino aliter, Ipse omne malum 
hereditarium a matre a Se prorsus removit, expulit et ejecit; Ipsi enim nullum malum ex hereditario a Patre fuit quia conceptus a Jehovah, sed a matre; haec differentia est; </p>
<p>hoc intelligitur per quod 
Dominus factus Justitia, Ipsum Sanctum, ac Divinum.      @1 rejectum$      @2 i omne$      @3 ad$      @4 i et$      @5 sit I$      @6 i aperte$      @7 i quam$      @8 sciant$      @9 prius$ </p>
