<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7966节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7966.</strong>“百姓就拿着没有发过酵的生面”表源于良善的真理的第一个状态，其中根本没有一丝虚假。这从“生面”和“没有发过酵”的含义清楚可知。“生面”是指源于良善的真理，因为“面粉”和“细面”表示真理，由它们制成的“生面”表示真理之良善，而由生面制成的“饼”表示爱之良善；当“饼”表示爱之良善时，其它事物，即“生面”和“面粉”表示在其秩序中的良善和真理；“饼”表示爱之良善（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节）。“没有发过酵”是指其中没有一丝虚假，“酵”是指虚假（参看<a href="7906.htm">7906</a>节）。<br />这明显是他们的第一个状态，也就是说，他们被释放之时的状态，因为经上说“百姓就拿着生面”；他们离开时，正在这样做。然而，下面一节（12:39）则描述了他们的第二个状态，在那里，经上说：“他们用埃及带出来的生面烤成无酵糕，这生面是没有发过酵的”，以此表示从良善之真理又产生根本没有一丝邪恶在里面的良善。这些就是那些属于属灵教会的人在处于良善时被主保守在的两个状态。在第一个状态下，他们从存在于意愿中的良善来看待并思考真理；在第二个状态下，他们通过良善与真理的这种婚姻来产生真理，通过意愿并行出这些真理，它们又变成了良善，如此反复进行。这些就是真理在那些属于属灵教会的人当中的直接产物和进一步的发展。在灵界，整个这一过程以代表的方式被表现为一棵长有叶子和果实的树。在那里，叶子是指真理，果实是指真理之良善，种子是指良善本身，其它一切都源于良善。</p>

And the people carried their dough before it was leavened. That this signifies the first state of truth from good, in which there is nothing of falsity, is evident from the signification of "dough," 
as being truth from good. For by "meal" and "fine flour" is signified truth; by the "dough" which is made therefrom, the good of truth; and by the "bread" which is made from the dough is signified the 
good of love; and when by "bread" is signified the good of love, by the other things, namely, by the "dough" and the "flour," are signified in their order goods and truths (that "bread" denotes the good 
of love, see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915); and from the signification of "before it was leavened," as being in which there was nothing of falsity 
(that "leaven" denotes falsity see n. 7906). [2] That this is the first state, namely, when they are liberated, is plain, because it is said that "the people carried their dough," that is, when they 
departed. But the second state is described in the following verse (39), by "they baked the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened," by which is signified 
that from the truth of good was again produced good in which there was nothing of falsity. These are the two states in which they who are of the spiritual church, when in good, are kept by the 
Lord-the first, that from the good which is of the will they see and think truth; the second, that from this marriage of good and truth they produce truths, which by willing them and doing them, again 
become goods, and so on continually. Such are the productions and derivations of truth with those who are of the spiritual church. In the spiritual world this is presented representatively as a tree 
with leaves and fruits; the leaves there are truths; the fruits are the goods of truth; the seeds are the goods themselves, from which are the rest. </p>

'And the people carried their dough before the yeast was added' means the first state of truth from good, in which there is no falsity at all. This is clear from the meaning of 'dough' as truth from 
good, for 'meal' and 'fine flour' mean truth, 'dough' that is made from them means the good of truth, and 'bread' that is made out of the dough means the good of love; and when 'bread' means the good 
of love the other things - 'dough' and 'meal' - mean forms of good and truth in their proper order (for the meaning of 'bread' as the good of love, see <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4117.htm">4117</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>); and from the meaning of 'before the yeast was added' as that in which there is no falsity at all. For the meaning of 'yeast' as falsity, see above in <a href="7906.htm">7906</a>. </p>

 This is 
plainly their first state, that is to say, when they were delivered, since it says that the people carried the dough; they were doing so when they went out. Their second state however is described in 
verse 39 below, where it says that they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened cakes since no yeast had been added, meaning that from the truth of good further good was produced 
that had no evil at all in it. These are the two states in which those belonging to the spiritual Church, when governed by good, are maintained by the Lord. In the first state good present in the 
will is the standpoint from which they see and contemplate truth; in the second good and truth now wedded together are the source from which they produce truths, which through the willing and doing 
of them become further forms of good, and so on repeatedly. Such are the direct products and further developments of truth among those who belong to the spiritual Church. In the spiritual world this 
whole process is portrayed in a representative manner, as a tree with leaves and fruit. The leaves portray truths, the fruit forms of the good of truth, and the seeds forms of good itself from which everything 
else springs. </p>

`Et portavit populus massam suam antequam fermentaretur': quod significet statum primum veri ex bono, in quo nihil falsi, constat ex significatione `massae' quod sit verum ex bono; per `farinam' enim 
et `similaginem' significatur verum, per `massam' quae inde {1} veri bonum, et per panem qui ex massa' significatur bonum amoris; cum per panem (m)significatur bonum amoris, per reliqua, nempe per massam 
et per farinam, significantur in suo ordine {2}bona et vera; quod `panis' sit bonum amoris, videatur n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915;(n) et ex significatione 
`antequam fermentaretur' quod sit in quo nihil falsi; quod `fermentum' sit falsum, videatur supra n. 7906. 	2 Quod hic status primus sit, nempe {3}cum liberati, patet, quia dicitur quod `populus 
portavit massam illam,' ita cum exirent; status autem secundus describitur vers. seq. 39, per quod {4}coxerint massam quam eduxerunt ex Aegypto, placentas azymas, quia non fermentata, per quae significatur 
quod ex vero boni iterum produceretur bonum in quo nihil falsi; sunt hi bini status in quibus illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, {5}cum in bono, tenentur a Domino: primus quod ex bono quod voluntatis 
videant et cogitent verum; alter {6}quod ex conjugio illo boni et veri producant vera quae per velle illa et facere illa iterum fiunt bona, et sic porro continue; sunt veri tales productiones 
et derivationes apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt; hoc in mundo spirituali sistitur repraesentative sicut arbor cum foliis et {7} fructibus; folia ibi sunt vera, fructus sunt bona veri, {8}semina 
sunt ipsa bona ex quibus reliqua.(n) 	@1 i significatur$ 	@2 vera et bona$ 	@3 liberationis$ 	@4 coxerunt$ 	@5 Before illi$ 	@6 est, ut$ 	@7 i cum$ 	@8 ipsa semina sunt intima bona$ </p>
