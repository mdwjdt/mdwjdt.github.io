<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3940.</strong>创世记30:14-16.割麦子的日子，流便出去，在田里寻见风茄，拿来给他母亲利亚。拉结对利亚说，请你把你儿子的风茄给我些。利亚对拉结说，你夺了我的丈夫还算小事吗？你又要夺我儿子的风茄吗？拉结说，为你儿子的风茄，今夜他可以与你同寝。到了晚上，雅各从田里回来，利亚出来迎接他说，你要与我同寝，因为我实在用我儿子的风茄把你雇下了。那一夜雅各就与她同寝。<br />“割麦子的日子，流便出去”表就其爱与仁的状态而言的信。“在田里寻见风茄（或催情果）”表存在于仁与爱的真理与良善里面的婚姻之爱的要素。“拿来给他母亲利亚”表应用于对外在真理的情感。“拉结对利亚说”表对内在真理的情感的觉察，以及对内在真理的渴望。“请你把你儿子的风茄给我些”表对属于婚姻之爱的事物的情感和渴望，它可以与这些事物彼此相互结合。“利亚对拉结说，你夺了我的丈夫还算小事吗”表婚姻渴望的存在。“你又要夺我儿子的风茄吗”表在这种情况下，将属世良善与外在真理联结起来的婚姻元素将被夺走。“拉结说”表同意。“为你儿子的风茄，今夜他可以与你同寝”表外在真理要与属世良善结合。“到了晚上，雅各从田里回来”表处于良善状态的真理之良善，只是尚处在诸如包裹属世层的那种模糊中。“利亚出来迎接他”表对外在真理的情感那一方的渴望。“说，你要与我同寝”表它要与那良善结合。“因为我实在用我儿子的风茄把你雇下了”表这事早就预先被看到和同意了。“那一夜雅各就与她同寝”表实际的结合。</p>

Verses 14-16. And Reuben went in the days of wheat-harvest, and found dudaim in the field, and brought them unto Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, Give me I pray of thy son's dudaim. And she 
said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my man, and wouldest thou take also my son's dudaim? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy son's dudaim. And Jacob 
came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come to me, for hiring I have hired thee with my son's dudaim; and he lay with her that night. "And Reuben went 
in the days of wheat-harvest," signifies faith as regards its state of love and charity; "and found dudaim in the field," signifies the things that belong to conjugial love in the truth and good of 
charity and love; "and brought them unto Leah his mother," signifies application to the affection of external truth; "and Rachel said to Leah," signifies the perception of the affection of interior 
truth, and a longing for it; "give me I pray of thy son's dudaim," signifies of the things that belong to conjugial love, with which it might be mutually and alternately conjoined; "and she said unto 
her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my man?" signifies that there is conjugial desire; "and wouldest thou take also my son's dudaim?" signifies that thus there would be withdrawn the conjugial 
relation of natural good with external truth; "and Rachel said," signifies consent; "therefore he shall be with thee tonight for thy son's dudaim," signifies that there should be conjunction; 
"and Jacob came from the field in the evening," signifies the good of truth in a state of good, but in obscurity such as belongs to the natural; "and Leah went out to meet him," signifies a longing on 
the part of the affection of external truth; "and said, Thou must come to me," signifies that it should be conjoined therewith; "for hiring I have hired thee with my son's dudaim," signifies that it 
was promised from forethought; "and he lay with her that night," signifies conjunction. </p>

Verses 14-16 And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest and found dudaim in the field, and brought them to Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, Give me now some of your son's dudaim. But she 
said to her, Is it a small thing for you to have taken my husband? And will you take also my son's dudaim? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you this night [in return] for your son's dudaim. 
And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come [in] to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's dudaim. And he lay with her that night. </p>
<p>'Reuben 
went in the days of the wheat harvest' means faith in regard to its state of love and charity. 'And found dudaim in the field' means the essentials of conjugial love that are present within the 
truth and good of charity and love. 'And brought them to Leah his mother' means application to the affection for external truth. 'And Rachel said to Leah' means perception by the affection for interior 
truth, and the desire for it. 'Give me now some of your son's dudaim' means for the things belonging to conjugial love, to which it might be joined mutually and reciprocally. 'But she said to her, 
Is it a small thing for you to have taken my husband?' means the existence of conjugial desire. 'And will you take also my son's dudaim?' means that in that case the conjugial element linking natural 
good to external truth would be taken away. 'And Rachel said' means consent. 'Therefore he will lie with you this night [in return] for your son's dudaim' means that external truth should be joined 
to natural good. 'And Jacob came from the field in the evening' means the good of truth in a state of good, yet also in obscurity such as envelops the natural. 'And Leah went out to meet him' means a 
desire on the part of the affection for external truth. 'And said, You must come [in] to me' means that it might be joined to that good. 'For I have surely hired you with my son's dudaim' means that this 
had accordingly been seen to and agreed beforehand. 'And he lay with her that night' means the actual joining together. </p>

</p><b>3940.</b>
Vers. 14-16.  Et ivit Reuben in diebus messis triticorum, et invenit dudaim in agro, et adduxit illos ad Leam matrem suam, et dixit Rachel ad Leam, Da quaeso mihi de dudaim filii tui. Et dixit illi, 
An parum sumpsisse te vivum meum, et sumes etiam dudaim filii mei? et dixit Rachel, Idcirco cubabit cum te nocte hac pro dudaim filii tui. Et venit Jacob de agro in vespera, et exivit Leah obviam ei, 
et dixit, Ad me venies, quia conducendo conduxi te in dudaim filii mei; et cubuit cum illa in nocte illa. `Ivit Reuben in diebus messis triticorum' significat fidem quoad statum ejus amoris et charitatis: 
`et invenit dudaim in agro' significat illa quae amoris conjugialis sunt in vero et bono charitatis et amoris: `et adduxit illos ad Leam matrem suam significat applicationem ad affectionem veri 
externi: `et dixit Rachel ad Leam' significat perceptionem affectionis et desiderium veri interioris: `Da quaeso mihi de dudaim filii tui' significat illorum quae amoris conjugialis sunt quibus 
mutuo et vicissim conjungeretur: `et dixit illi, An parum sumpsisse te virum meum' significat quod conjugiale desiderium sit: </p>
<p>`et sumes etiam dudaim filii mei' significat quod sic conjugiale subtraheret 
boni naturalis cum vero externo: `et dixit Rachel' significat consensum: `Idcirco cubabit cum te nocte hac pro dudaim filii tui' significat quod conjungeretur{1}: `et venit Jacob de agro 
in vespera' significat veri bonum in statu boni, sed in obscuro quale naturali: `et exivit Leah obviam ei' significat desiderium a parte affectionis veri externi: `et dixit, Ad me venies' significat 
quod ei conjungeretur: `quia conducendo conduxi te in dudaim filii mei' significat quod sic ex proviso constipulatum: `et cubuit cum illa in nocte illa' significat conjunctionem. @1 i amore 
conjugiali$ </p>
