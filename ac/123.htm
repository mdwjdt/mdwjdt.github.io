<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>123.</strong>属天之人觉察故也承认一切都属于主，属灵之人虽也承认，却只是口头上，因为他是从圣经学到这一点，属世属肉体之人既不承认，也不接受，若有所得，他称为自己的，若有所失，他觉得自己也要一并丧失。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]123.</strong> Heavenly people acknowledge, because they perceive, that absolutely everything is the Lord's. Spiritual people too acknowledge it, but only in speech, because they have learned it from the Word. Worldly and body-centered people do not accept or agree with the idea; they claim as their own any ability they discover inside themselves, and if they lose it, they consider it completely destroyed. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 123</b></p><p><b>123.</b>
The celestial man acknowledges, because he perceives, that all things both in general and in particular are the Lord's. The spiritual man does indeed acknowledge the same, but with the mouth, because 
he has learned it from the Word. The worldly and corporeal man neither acknowledges nor admits it; but whatever he has he calls his own, and imagines that were he to lose it, he would altogether perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 123</b></p><p><b>123.</b>
By virtue of his perception the celestial man acknowledges that every single thing is the Lord's. The spiritual man acknowledges this too, but in his case it is something oral, because he has learned 
it from the Word. The worldly and bodily-minded man neither acknowledges nor admits it. Instead he says that everything residing with him is his own, and imagines that if he were to lose it, he would 
perish completely.

</p><b>123.</b>
Quod omnia et singula sint Domini, homo caelestis agnoscit quia percipit; at homo spiritualis quidem agnoscit sed ore quia ex Verbo novit: homo mundanus et corporeus nec agnoscit, nec concedit, sed 
quicquid apud eum, dicit esse suum, quod si perderet, putat prorsus perire.
