<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7627.</strong>仅凭属世人所拥有的低劣之光，谁都能看出，真理和良善彼此一致，而且它们能结合在一起；而真理与邪恶是不一致的，它们不能结合在一起；信与仁同样是一致的。实际经验也证明这一点；在生活上陷入邪恶的人要么在信仰上陷入邪恶，要么根本没有信仰，要么完全反对信仰。（这是一个奥秘）在生活上陷入邪恶的人会陷入其邪恶的虚假，尽管他以为自己处于真理。他如此以为是因为，他处于说服性信仰，就是下文所论述的那种信仰。</p>

From the mere light of his natural man everyone can see that Truth and Good are in agreement, and also that they can be conjoined together; and that truth and evil are in disagreement, and that they 
cannot be conjoined together; and in like manner faith and charity. Experience itself testifies the same; that he who is in evil as to life is either in falsity as to faith, or is in no faith, or is quite 
opposed to faith. And (what is a secret) he who is in evil as to life is in the falsity of his evil, although he believes that he is in truth. That he so believes is because he is in persuasive faith, 
of which in what follows.            EXODUS 10 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto Pharaoh; because I have made heavy his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may put these 
My signs in the midst of him.      2. And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and My signs which I have set in them, and that ye 
may know that I am Jehovah.      3. And Moses and Aaron came unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, How long dost thou refuse to be humbled before Me? let My people 
go, that they may serve Me.      4. For if thou refuse to let My people go, behold tomorrow I will bring the locust into thy border.      5. And it shall cover the surface of the land, and one 
shall not be able to see the land; and it shall devour the residue of that which is escaped that is left to you from the hail; and it shall devour every tree that sprouteth forth to you out of the field.  
    6. And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which thy fathers saw not, nor thy father's fathers, since the day that they were 
upon the ground even unto this day. And he looked back, and went out from before Pharaoh.      7. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this be a snare to us? Send the men away, and let 
them serve Jehovah their God; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is perishing?      8. And Moses and Aaron were brought back unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go ye, serve Jehovah your God; who and 
who are going?      9. And Moses said, We will go with our boys, and with our old men; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flock and with our herd, will we go; because we have a feast of 
Jehovah.      10. And he said unto them, So shall Jehovah be with you, when I let you go, and your babe; see ye that evil is before your faces.      11. Not so; go I pray, ye that are young men, and 
serve Jehovah; because this ye seek. And he drove them out from the faces of Pharaoh.      12. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locust, and it shall 
come up upon the land of Egypt, and shall devour all the herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.      13. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an 
east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locust.      14. And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the 
border of Egypt, very grievous; before it there was no such locust as this, and after it there shall not be such.      15. And it covered the surface of the whole land, and the land was darkened; and 
it devoured all the herb of the land, and all the fruit of the tree which the hail had left; and there was not left any green thing in the tree and in the herb of the field, in the whole land of Egypt.  
    16. And Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron; and he said, I have sinned to Jehovah your God, and to you.      17. And now forgive I pray my sin only this once, and supplicate ye to Jehovah 
your God that He remove from upon me this death only.      18. And he went out from before Pharaoh, and supplicated unto Jehovah.      19. And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong sea wind, and took 
up the locust, and cast it into the sea Suph; there was not left one locust in all the border of Egypt.      20. And Jehovah made firm Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.  
    21. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be thick darkness upon the land of Egypt, and one shall grope in thick darkness.      22. And Moses stretched 
out his hand toward heaven; and there was a most dense thick darkness in the whole land of Egypt three days.      23. They saw not a man his brother, and there rose not up anyone from what was under 
him for three days; and all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.      24. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only your flock and your herd shall stay; your babe 
also shall go with you.      25. And Moses said, Thou shalt also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may perform it unto Jehovah our God.      26. And our cattle also shall 
go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof we must take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah until we come thither.      27. And Jehovah made 
firm Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.      28. And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from before me, take heed to thyself that thou see my faces no more; for in the day thou seest my faces thou 
shalt die.      29. And Moses said, Thou hast rightly spoken; I will see thy faces again no more. </p>

The inferior light which his natural man possesses is alone sufficient to enable anyone to see that truth and good are compatible with each other and also capable of being linked together, while truth 
and evil are incompatible and incapable of being linked, and that faith and charity are in a similar way compatible. Actual experience bears witness to the same thing; one knows from experience that 
the person who pursues an evil life either has faith that is false, no faith at all, or an altogether antagonistic attitude towards faith. And - this is an arcanum - the person who pursues an evil life 
is directed by falsity attached to his evil, although he imagines that he is guided by truth. The reason why he imagines he is guided by truth is that he is under the influence of faith which is mere 
persuasion, a kind of faith that will be dealt with later on.  </p>

Quisque homo ex solo lumine naturalis sui hominis potest videre quod verum et bonum concordent, et quoque quod conjungi possint; et quod verum et malum discordent, et quod non conjungi possint; similiter 
fides et charitas.  Idem testatur ipsa experientia; qui in malo est quoad vitam, ille aut in falso est quoad fidem, aut in nulla fide, aut prorsus contra fidem.  Et quod arcanum est, qui in malo 
est quoad vitam, is in falso sui mali est, tametsi credat quod sit in vero; quod credat quod sit in vero, est quia in fide persuasiva est, de qua in sequentibus. CAPUT X 	1.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, 
Veni ad Pharaonem; quia Ego aggravavi cor illius et cor servorum illius, propterea ut ponam signa Mea haec in medio illius. 	2.  Et propterea ut narres in auribus filii tui, et filii filii tui, 
quae operatus sum in Aegypto, et signa Mea quae posui in illis, et sciatis quod Ego JEHOVAH. 	3.  Et venit Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et dixerunt ad illum, Ita dicit JEHOVAH DEUS Hebraeorum, Quousque 
renuis humiliari coram Me? dimitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi. 	4.  Quia si renuis tu dimittere populum Meum, ecce Ego adduco cras locustam in terminum tuum. 	5.  Et obteget superficiem 
terrae, et non poterit videre terram, et comedet residuum evasionis relictae vobis a grandine; et comedet omnem arborem germinantem vobis ex agro. 	6.  Et replebuntur domus tuae, et domus omnium servorum 
tuorum, et domus omnium Aegyptiorum; quam non viderunt patres tui, et patres patrum tuorum, a die fuerunt super humo usque ad diem hunc: et respexit et exivit a cum Pharaone. 	7.  Et dixerunt servi 
Pharaonis ad illum, Quousque erit hoc nobis ad laqueum? dimitte viros, et serviant JEHOVAE DEO illorum; an nondum scis quod pereat Aegyptus? 	8.  Et reductus Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et dixit 
ad illos, Ite, servite JEHOVAE DEO vestro; quis et quis eunt? 	9.  Et dixit Moscheh, Cum pueris nostris et cum senibus nostris ibimus, cum filiis nostris et cum filiabus nostris, cum grege nostro 
et cum armento nostro ibimus, quia festum JEHOVAE nobis. 	10.  Et dixit ad illos, Erit sic JEHOVAH cum vobis, quando dimisero vos et infantem vestrum; videte quod malum apud facies vestras. 	11.  Non 
ita, ite quaeso juvenes, et servite JEHOVAE, quia hoc vos quaeritis; et expulit illos ex faciebus Pharaonis. 	12.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam super terram Aegypti ob locustam, 
et ascendet super terram Aegypti, et comedet omnem herbam terrae, omne quod reliquit grando. 	13.  Et extendit Moscheh baculum suum super terram Aegypti, et JEHOVAH adduxit ventum orientalem in terram 
toto die illo et tota nocte; mane factum, et ventus orientalis attulit locustam. 	14.  Et ascendit locusta super omnem terram Aegypti, et quievit in omni termino Aegypti, gravis valde; ante illam 
non fuit ita locusta sicut illa, et post illam non erit ita. 	15.  Et obtexit superficiem totius terrae, et obtenebrata terra, et comedit omnem herbam terrae, et omnem fructum arboris, quem residuum 
fecit grando; et non residuum fuit ullum viride in arbore et in herba agri in tota terra Aegypti. 	16.  Et festinavit Pharao ad vocandum Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit, Peccavi JEHOVAE DEO vestro, et 
vobis. 	17.  Et nunc remitte quaeso peccatum meum, tantum hac vice, et supplicate JEHOVAE DEO vestro, et removeat desuper me tantum mortem hanc. 	18.  Et exivit a cum Pharaone, et supplicavit ad JEHOVAM. 	19. 
 Et convertit JEHOVAH ventum maris validum valde, et sustulit locustam, et conjecit illam mare Suph, non relicta locusta una in omni termino Aegypti. 	20.  Et obfirmavit JEHOVAH cor Pharaonis, 
et non dimisit filios Israelis. 	21.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam ad caelum, et erit caligo super terra Aegypti, et palpabit caligine. 	22.  Et extendit Moscheh manum suam 
ad caelum, et fuit caligo densa in tota terra Aegypti tribus diebus. 	23.  Non viderunt vir fratrem suum, et non surrexerunt quis de sub se tribus diebus; et omnibus filiis Israelis fuit lux in habitationibus 
illorum. 	24.  Et vocavit Pharaoh ad Moschen, et dixit, Ite, servite JEHOVAE; tantum grex vester et armentum vestrum subsistet; etiam infans vester ibit cum vobis. 	25.  Et dixit Moscheh, 
Etiam tu dabis in manum nostram sacrificia et holocausta, et faciemus JEHOVAE DEO nostro. 	26.  Et etiam pecus nostrum ibit cum nobis, non relinquetur ungula, quia de illo accipiemus ad serviendum JEHOVAE 
DEO nostro, et nos non scimus quo serviemus JEHOVAE, usque dum venimus illuc. 	27.  Et obfirmavit JEHOVAH cor Pharaonis, et non voluit dimittere illos. 	28.  Et dixit illi Pharao, Abi ab apud 
me, cave tibi ne addas videre facies meas, quia in die videre te facies meas morieris. 	29.  Et dixit Moscheh, Recte locutus es, non addam amplius videre facies tuas. </p>
