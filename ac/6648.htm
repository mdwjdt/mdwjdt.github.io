<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6648节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6648.</strong>“增多，极其众多”表它们在源于良善的真理上大大增多。这从“增多”和“众多”的含义清楚可知：“增多”是指真理上的增多（参看<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>，<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="2847.htm">2847</a>节）；“众多”是指进一步的分支，因而是指真理的不断增多。它之所以是指源于良善的真理的增多，是因为现在论述的主题是教会的建立。事实上，就人里面的教会而言，情况是这样：当它正在建立时，此人处于真理，良善通过真理增长。可一旦教会在他里面建立起来，那么此人便处于良善，并通过良善处于真理；这时，真理不断增多。当他活在世上时，只有小的增长或增多，因为在世上，对衣食和其它事情的忧虑会成为它的一个阻碍。而在来世，增长或增多是巨大的，并且会持续下去，直到永远；因为来自神性的智慧是没有止境的。天使以这种方式不断变得更完美，所有进入来世变成天使的人都以这种方式变得完美；因为属于智慧的一切都能无限延伸，智慧的事物在数量上是无限的。由此可见，智慧能持续增长到永恒，然而仍远远达不到第一层级；因为神性是无限的，来源于无限的东西必是这样。</p>

And multiplied, and became very exceeding numerous. That this signifies that they increased very much as to truths from good, is evident from the signification of "being multiplied," as being to increase 
as to truths (see n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847); and from the signification of "becoming numerous," as being further derivation, thus the increase of truth continually. The reason why it denotes 
the increase of truth from good, is that the subject now treated of is the renewed church; for with the church in man the case is this: while it is being set up anew the man is in truths and by means 
of these good increases; but when the church with him has been set up anew, then the man is in good, and from good in truths, which then increase continually-but little during his life in the world, 
because here cares for food and clothing, and for other things, act as a hindrance; but in the other life immeasurably, and this perpetually to eternity; for the wisdom which is from the Divine has 
no end. Thus the angels are perfected continually, and thus all are perfected who become angels when they come into the other life; for everything which is of wisdom is of infinite extension, and the 
things of wisdom are infinite in number. From this it can be seen that wisdom can increase to eternity, and yet not reach far beyond the first degree; for the reason that the Divine is infinite, and that 
such is the case with what is from the infinite. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6648</b></p><p><b>6648.</b>
'And multiplied and became very very numerous' means that they increased enormously in truths from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'multiplying' as increasing in truths, dealt with in <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="2847.htm">2847</a>; and from the meaning of 'became numerous' as further branching out, thus a constant increase in truth. The reason why it is an increase in truth from good is that the subject now 
is the Church when it has been established. For so far as the establishment of the Church with a person is concerned, it happens as follows: While it is being established the person is governed by truths, 
and through them good increases. But once the Church has been established with him he is governed by good, and from good by truths, which are then constantly increasing. Little increase takes place 
while he lives in the world, because in the world concerns about food and clothing and about other matters prevent it. But in the next life the increase is vast, and goes on for evermore; for there 
is no end to wisdom from the Divine. In this way the angels are constantly being made more perfect, and in that same way all entering the next life are made into angels; for every aspect of wisdom 
is capable of infinite expansion and the aspects of wisdom are infinite in number. From this it may be seen that wisdom can go on increasing for evermore and still not reach very far beyond the first 
degree, the reason for this being that the Divine is the Infinite, and what has its origin in the Infinite is inevitably like that. </p>

`Et multiplicabantur et numerosi facti in valde valde': quod significet quod plurimum crescerent quoad vera a bono, constat a significatione `multiplicari' quod sit crescere quoad vera, de qua n. 43, 
55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847; et ex significatione `numerosi facti sunt' quod sit derivatio ulterior, {1} sic incrementum veri continue; quod sit incrementum veri ex bono, est quia nunc agitur de Ecclesia 
instaurata; {2}nam cum Ecclesia apud hominem (t)ita se habet: cum instauratur, tunc homo est in veris, et per illa crescit bonum; cum autem Ecclesia apud illum instaurata est, tunc homo est in bono 
et ex {3}bono in veris, quae tunc crescunt continue; parum cum vivit in mundo, quia ibi impediunt curae pro victu et amictu, et pro rebus illis, at in altera vita in immensum, et hoc perpetuo in aeternum; 
sapientia enim quae a Divino non aliquem finem habet; ita angeli perficiuntur continue, ac ita omnes qui cum in alteram vitam veniunt, fiunt angeli; unaquaevis enim res quae est sapientiae est extensionis 
infinitae, et res sapientiae sunt numero infinito; inde constare potest quod sapientia in aeternum possit crescere, et tamen usque non longe ultra gradum primum {4}perveniri; hoc ex eo est quia 
Divinum est Infinitum, et quod ex Infinito est tale est. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 cum Ecclesia enim$ 	@3 eo crescunt vera; et hoc$ 	@4 d perveniri queat i and d extendi Presumably S intended to restore perveniri.
