<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />1783.如前所述，此处所包含的事件均取自真实的历史。也就是说，耶和华确如所描述的那样对亚伯兰说话，并将迦南地应许他为业；亚伯兰也确如所描述的那样被吩咐取了一头母牛犊，一只母山羊，一只公绵羊，一只斑鸠和一只雏鸽；鸷鸟的确下来落在这些尸体上；亚伯兰的确沉睡，并且在睡梦中有可怕的大黑暗；日落天黑的时候，他也的确看到了冒烟的炉和烧着的火把从那些肉块中经过，以及除此之外所提及的其它一切细节。这些事件都是真实的历史，但每一个事件，甚至所发生的最小细节都具有代表性；描述这些事件的话语，哪怕一个字的一点一划，都具有灵义，也就是说，每一个细节里面都含有内义。因为圣言中的每一个细节都是被启示的，既是被启示的，就只能来自属天的源头；也就是说，它们里面必隐含属天和属灵之物，否则，就不是主的圣言了。<br />这些就是内义所包含的事物。当这层意义摊开时，字义就消失不见了，仿佛它不存在。另一方面，当注意力投向历史意义，或字义时，内义就会消失不见，仿佛它不存在。这两种意义的关系就象天堂之光和尘世之光的关系，或反过来尘世之光和天堂之光的关系。当天堂之光显现时，尘世之光如同幽暗，这是我通过亲身经历所得知的。但是，当人处于尘世之光时，天堂之光即便显现，也如同幽暗。人类心智也一样：对于将一切事物都局限于人类智慧，或世俗知识的人来说，天上的智慧显为某种模糊、空白的东西；但对于拥有天上智慧的人来说，人类智慧则象完全模糊的东西，若里面没有天上的光线，它必如同幽暗。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1783.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />THE contents here, as I have said before, are true history.{*1} Jehovah did talk this way with Abram, and promised him he would inherit the land of Canaan. Jehovah did command Abram to arrange the heifer, she-goat, ram, turtledove, and chick as he did. The winged creatures did swoop down onto the bodies. Slumber did fall on Abram, and in his sleep, terror of shadows. When the sun had set, he did see a furnace of smoke along with a torch of flame between the parts. And so on. These details are historically true, and yet each and every one of them down to the smallest action represents something, while the words of the story themselves down to the smallest jot have a symbolism.{*2} In other words, every last feature has an inner meaning. Everything in the Word is inspired, and since it is inspired, it cannot come from any source but a heavenly one. It cannot hide any message but a heavenly and spiritual one in its inner recesses. Otherwise it would never be the Lord's Word.<br />[2] This is the message contained in the inner sense. When the inner sense lies open, the literal sense is obliterated, as if it did not exist. Conversely when attention is paid only to the historical or literal meaning, the inner meaning is obliterated, as if it did not exist.<br />The relationship is like that of heavenly light to the world's light, and that in turn of the world's light to heavenly light. When heavenly light appears, the world's light seems dark, as I have learned from experience. On the other hand, when anyone sees by the world's light, heavenly light would seem dark if it appeared at all. It is the same with the human mind. Anyone who relies exclusively on human wisdom, or in other words, on book learning, sees heavenly wisdom as a dark hole. Anyone who enjoys heavenly wisdom, though, finds human wisdom simplistic and vague — a form of darkness, if it is unlit by heavenly rays.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For earlier statements about the historicity of the narrative portions of the Word from the mention of Eber in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1783/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>Genesis 11</a> onward, see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1783/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1403" target=_top>1403</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1783/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1408" target=_top>1408:1</a>.

THE INTERNAL SENSE The things which are here contained, are as before said true historicals, namely, that Jehovah spoke thus with Abram, and that the land of Canaan was promised him as an inheritance; 
that he was commanded so to place the heifer, the she-goat, ram, turtledove, and young pigeon; that the fowls came down upon the bodies; that a deep sleep fell upon him, and in the sleep a terror of 
darkness; and that when the sun had set, there was seen by him as it were a furnace of smoke with a torch of fire between the parts; besides the other historicals. These are true historicals, but still 
each and all of them, even to the least of what was done, are representative; and the words themselves by which they are described, are, as to the smallest iota, significative. That is to say, in 
each and all of these things there is an internal sense; for each and all of the things contained in the Word are inspired, and being inspired they cannot but be from a heavenly origin; that is, they 
must necessarily store up within them celestial and spiritual things, for otherwise it could not possibly be the Word of the Lord.  [2] These are the things contained in the internal sense; and when 
this sense lies open, the sense of the letter is obliterated, as if there were none; and on the other hand, when attention is given solely to the historical sense or that of the letter, the internal sense 
is obliterated, as if there were none. These two are related as is heavenly light to the light of the world; and, conversely, as is the light of the world to heavenly light. When heavenly light appears, 
then the light of the world is as thick darkness; as has been made known to me by experience; but when anyone is in the light of the world, then heavenly light, if it appeared, would be as thick 
darkness; the same as with human minds: to him who places everything in human wisdom, or in memory-knowledges, heavenly wisdom appears as an obscure nothing; but to him who is in heavenly wisdom, human 
wisdom is as a kind of obscure general affair, which, if there were not heavenly rays in it, would be as thick darkness. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>As stated already, the narratives contained here draw on true history; that is to say, Jehovah did in fact speak to Abram as described; the land of Canaan was promised to him as 
an inheritance; he was in fact commanded as described to arrange a heifer, she-goat, ram, turtle dove and fledgling; birds of prey came down on the carcasses; a deep sleep came over him, and in that 
sleep a horror of darkness; and when the sun had set he did in fact see what looked like a smoking furnace with a flaming torch passing between the parts; besides all the other details mentioned. These 
events are historically true, but even so every single one, down to the smallest event that took place, is representative; and the actual words used to describe those events, down to the smallest part 
of a letter, carry a spiritual meaning, that is, every single detail has an internal sense within it. For every single detail in the Word is inspired, and being inspired cannot derive from other than 
a heavenly origin; that is, celestial and spiritual things lie concealed in its inner recesses. If this were not so it could not possibly be the Word of the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These are the things which 
the internal sense contains. When this sense lies open to view the sense of the letter passes out of sight, as though it did not exist, as also conversely when attention is paid solely to the historical 
sense, or sense of the letter, the internal sense passes out of sight, as though it did not exist. The relationship of the two senses is like that of heavenly light to the light of the world, and conversely 
like that of the light of the world to heavenly light. When heavenly light is seen, the light of the world is like thick darkness, as I have been made to know from experience. But when anyone 
is in the light of the world, heavenly light, if it is seen, would be like thick darkness. It is similar with human minds: to the person who limits everything to human wisdom, or worldly knowledge, 
heavenly wisdom is seen as something obscure and blank; but to one who possesses heavenly wisdom, human wisdom is like something totally obscure which, unless it had heavenly rays of light within it, 
would be as thick darkness. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>QUAE hic continentur, sunt, ut prius dictum, historica vera, nempe quod a Jehovah ita locutum cum Abramo, et quod ei in hereditatem promissa terra Canaan; 
quod ei mandatum ut sic poneret vitulam, capram, arietem, turturem et pullum; quod volatile descenderit super corpora; quod ceciderit super eum sopor, et in sopore terror tenebrarum; et cum sol occidisset, 
quod visum ei sicut furnus fumi cum face ignis inter partes, praeter cetera; haec sunt historica vera, sed usque omnia et singula, quoad minimum facti, repraesentativa, et ipsa verba quibus describuntur, 
quoad minimum iotam significativa, hoc est, in omnibus et singulis est sensus internus; sunt enim omnia et singula quae in Verbo, inspirata, et quia inspirata, non possunt aliter quam esse 
ab origine caelesti, hoc est, caelestia et spiritualia in sinu suo recondere, aliter nusquam foret Verbum Domini; [2] haec sunt quae continentur in sensu interno; qui sensus cum patet, obliteratur sensus 
litterae sicut nullus foret, ut et vicissim, cum ad solum sensum historicum seu litterae attenditur, obliteratur sensus internus sicut nullus foret: haec se habent sicut lux caelestis ad lucem mundi, 
et vicissim sicut lux mundi est sicut caligo tunc lux mundi est sicut caligo, quod per experientiam mihi notum factum est; at cum quis in luce mundi est, tunc lux caelestis, si apparet, foret sicut 
caligo; similiter ac in mentibus humanis, qui in sapientia humana seu in scientiis ponit omne, ei sapientia caelestis apparet sicut obscurum nullum; at qui in sapientia caelesti est, ei sapientia humana 
est sicut commune quoddam obscurum in quo nisi caelestes radii insunt, foret sicut caligo. </p>
