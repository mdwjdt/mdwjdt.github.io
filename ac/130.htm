<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>130.</strong>凡试图从世界获取智慧的人，感官和知识是他的“园子”，我欲和物欲是他的“伊甸”。他的“东方”是西方，亦即他自己，他的“幼发拉底河”是致死的知识，他的“第二道河”（流经“亚述”的）是产生谬见的愚痴的理性，他的“第三道河”（流经“埃塞俄比亚”的）是邪恶和错误的原则，是他对信仰的认知，由此产生的智慧是他的“第四道河”，在圣经中，此等智慧被称为“巫术”。当知识沦为巫术以后，象征知识的“埃及”就寓指这等人，因为从圣经可知，他试图凭自己获得智慧。经上论到他们说：“主耶和华如此说，埃及王法老啊，我与你这卧在自己河中的大鱼为敌。你曾说，这河是我的，是我为自己造的……埃及地必荒废凄凉，他们就知道我是耶和华。因为法老说，这河是我的，是我所造的。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.3.htm">29:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.9.htm">9</a>）此等人也被称为“阴间的伊甸的诸树”，法老和埃及人被论到说：“我将它扔到阴间，与下坑的人一同下去。伊甸的一切树，就是黎巴嫩得水滋润，最佳最美的树都在阴府受了安慰……然而你要与伊甸的诸树一同下到阴府，在未受割礼的人中，与被杀的人一同躺卧。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.16.htm">31:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.18.htm">18</a>）这是说法老和他的群众，其中“伊甸的诸树”表源于圣经的知识，被他们的理性给玷污了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]130.</strong> For those wanting to learn wisdom from the world, the "garden" is sensory evidence and factual information; their "Eden" is self-love and materialism. Their east is west; that is, they are their own east. Their Euphrates is all the factual knowledge they have learned — damnable knowledge. Their second river, in the area of Assyria, is insane reasoning and the falsity it spawns. Their third river, in the area of Cush, is principles that advocate evil and falsity, developed out of such reasoning; these are the catechism of their faith. Their fourth is the wisdom that results.{*1} The Word describes this wisdom as magic,{*2} and that is why Egypt, which symbolizes scholarly learning, also symbolizes occult knowledge, having adopted the magical arts. The reason is given in various places in the Word: they wanted to teach themselves wisdom. Ezekiel speaks of them this way:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih{*3} has said: "Here, now, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, you great sea creature, lying in the middle of his rivers, who has said, ‘My river is mine, and I have made myself.' And the land of Egypt will become a desolation and wasteland — and they will know that I am Jehovah — because he said, ‘The river is mine, and I myself have made it.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_130/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_29_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 29:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_130/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_29_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />In another passage treating of Pharaoh the Egyptian, the same prophet refers to people of this type as trees of Eden in hell:<br />... when I make him go down into hell, accompanying those going down into the pit. Whom have you come to resemble this way, in glory and in greatness, among the trees of Eden, when you were made to go down with the trees of Eden into the underground realm,{*4} in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those stabbed by the sword? This is Pharaoh and all his horde. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_130/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_16" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_130/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_18" target=_top>18</a>)<br />The trees of Eden stand for facts and religious knowledge from the Word, which such people accordingly profane by the use of crooked reasoning. </p>

He who desires to be wise from the world, has for his "garden" the things of sense and of memory-knowledge [sensualia et scientifica]; the love of self and the love of the world are his "Eden"; his "east" 
is the west, or himself; his "river Euphrates" is all his memory-knowledge [scientificum], which is condemned; his "second river" where is "Assyria" is infatuated reasoning productive of falsities; 
his "third river" where is "Ethiopia" is the principles of evil and falsity thence derived, which are the knowledges of his faith; his "fourth river" is the wisdom thence derived, which in the Word 
is called "magic." And therefore "Egypt"-which signifies memory-knowledge [scientia]-after the knowledge became magical, signifies such a man, because, as may be seen from the Word, he desires to be 
wise from self. Of such it is written in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said the Lord Jehovih, Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great whale that lieth in the midst of his rivers, who hath 
said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. And the land of Egypt shall be for a solitude, and a waste, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he hath said, The river is mine, 
and I have made it (Ezek. 29:3, 9). Such men are also called "trees of Eden in hell" in the same Prophet, where also Pharaoh, or the Egyptian, is treated of in these words: </p>
<p>     When I shall have 
made him descend into hell with them that descend into the pit; to whom art thou thus made like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be made to descend with the trees of 
Eden into the lower earth, in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his crew (Ezek. 31:16, 18), where the "trees of Eden" denote knowledges [scientifica 
et cognitiones] from the Word, which they thus profane by reasonings.            Genesis 2, verses 18-25      18. And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will 
make him a help as with him.      19. And Jehovah God formed out of the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and brought it to the man to see what he would call it; and whatsoever 
the man called every living soul, that was the name thereof.      20. And the man gave names to every beast, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every wild animal of the field; but for the 
man there was not found a help as with him.      21. And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in the place thereof.  
    22. And the rib which Jehovah God had taken from the man, He built into a woman, and brought her to the man.      23. And the man said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore 
she shall be called wife, because she was taken out of man [vir].      24. Therefore shall a man [vir] leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one 
flesh.      25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. </p>

The person who wishes to become wise from the world has for his 'garden' sensory evidence and factual knowledge. His 'Eden' is self-love and love of the world, his 'east' is the west or himself. His 
'river Euphrates' is all his factual knowledge, which is condemned; his 'second river', where Asshur is, is his insane reasoning from which come falsities; his 'third river', where Cush is, is the resulting 
assumptions he makes consisting of evil and falsity, which are his cognitions of faith; his 'fourth' is the wisdom that results, which in the Word is called magic. This is why Egypt, which means 
knowledge, after it has become magical, means this kind of person, the reason being that he wants to become wise from self, as shown throughout the Word. Such people are described in Ezekiel as follows, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster lying in the midst of his rivers, who said, My river is my own, and I have made myself. And the 
land of Egypt will be made into a desolation and a waste. And they will know that I am Jehovah. Moreover he has said, The river is mine, and I made it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2029:3,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 29:3, 9</a>.   
</blockquote>
People like this are also called 
in the same prophet where again Pharaoh or the Egyptian is the subject 'the trees of Eden in hell' as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause him to go down into hell with those going down into the pit. Whom have 
you become like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You will be made to go down with the trees of Eden into the nether world, in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those pierced by 
the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his horde. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:16,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:16, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'trees of Eden' stands for facts and cognitions drawn from the Word which they profane in this manner by means of reasonings.

Qui ex mundo sapere vult, 'ei hortus' sunt sensualia et scientifica; 'Eden ejus' est amor sui et mundi; 'oriens ejus' est occidens seu ipse; 'fluvius ejus Euphrates' est omne ejus scientificum, quod 
damnatum; 'alter fluvius,' ubi 'Asshur,' est vesana ratiocinatio, inde falsitates; 'tertius fluvius,' ubi 'Cush,' sunt principia inde mali et falsi: quae sunt cognitiones ejus fidei; 'quartus' est sapientia 
inde, quae vocatur in Verbo magia; quare 'Aegyptus,' quae significat scientiam, postquam magica facta, significat talem, et quidem ex causa, de qua passim in Verbo, quia ex se vult sapere; de 
quibus ita apud Ezechielem, 	Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, {1} Ecce Ego contra te, Pharaoh: rex Aegypti, cete magne, cubans in medio fluminum suorum, qui dixit, Mihi flumen meum, et ego feci me;...et erit 
terra Aegypti in solitudinem et vastitatem; et cognoscent, quod Ego Jehovah, propterea, quod dixit, Fluvius mihi, et ego feci, xxix 3, 9. Tales quoque vocantur arbores Edenis in inferno apud eundem 
prophetam ubi etiam de Pharaone seu Aegyptio agitur, his verbis, 	Cum descendere fecero eum in infernum, cum descendentibus in foveam;...Cui similis factus es sic in gloria, et in magnitudine, inter 
arbores Edenis? cum descendere factus fueris cum arboribus Edenis in terram inferiorem, in medio praeputiatorum: cum confossis gladio: hic Pharaoh et omnis turba ejus, xxxi 16, {x}18; </p>
<p>ubi 'arbores 
Edenis' pro scientificis et cognitionibus ex Verbo, quae per ratiocinia sic profanant. @	1 See n. 1793, 2921 and 9167 for explanation. Sch. transcribes the Hebrew Adonai Jehovih.$ </p>

 Et dixit JEHOVAH DEUS, Non bonum ut sit homo solus is; faciam ei auxilium tanquam apud illum. 	19.  Et formavit JEHOVAH DEUS ex humo omnem bestiam agri: et omnem avem caelorum, et adduxit 
ad hominem ad videndi quid vocaret id; et quicquid vocabat id homo, animam viventem, id nomen ejus. 	20.  Et vocabat homo nomina omni bestiae, et avi caelorum, et omni ferae agri; et homini non

DEUS costam, quam sumpsit de homine, in mulierem, et adduxit eam ad hominem. 	23.  Et dixit homo, Hac vice, os de ossibus meis, et caro de carne mea; propter hoc vocabitur uxor, quia ex viro sumpta
