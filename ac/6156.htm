<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6156节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6156.</strong>“你们要把五分之一纳给法老”表余留要被归入内在掌控之下的属世层中的总体之物。这从“五”和“五分之一”含义，以及“法老”的代表清楚可知：“五”和“五分之一”是指余留（参看<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5894.htm">5894</a>节）；“法老”是指属世层中的总体之物（参看<a href="6153.htm">6153</a>节）。之所以说“内在掌控之下”，原因如前所述（<a href="6145.htm">6145</a>节）。至于何为余留，可参看前文（<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>，<a href="5135.htm">5135</a>，<a href="5897.htm">5897</a>，<a href="5898.htm">5898</a>节），即：它们是由主储存在内层人中的良善与真理。当人处于良善的状态时，它们就被带入外层人或属世人中；但是，他一陷入邪恶的状态，它们就被撤回，再次被储存起来。它们被撤回，并再次被储存起来，是为了防止它们与邪恶混在一起，由此而遭到毁灭。<br />当人不能重生时，他里面的余留被仔细安全地保存在他的内层中。但当他正在重生时，在这种情况下，余留从内层被带入外层，因为通过重生，内层与外层结合，并行如一体。这些余留首先被归入总体之物，然后逐渐被归入具体部分。由于此处在内义上所论述的主题是属世层的重生，故从所说的可知，这些余留被归入属世层中的总体之物是什么意思。</p>

That ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh. That this signifies remains, that these are for the general in the natural which is under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of "five" 
and of a "fifth part," as being remains (see n. 5291, 5894); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being what is general in the natural (see above, n. 6153). It is said "under the auspices of 
the internal" for the reason spoken of above (n. 6145). What remains are may be seen above (n. 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135, 5897, 5898), namely, that they are goods and truths from the Lord stored up 
in the interior man. These are let down into the exterior or natural man when he is in a state of good; but the moment he comes into a state of evil they are drawn back and stored up again. The reason 
of their being drawn back and stored up again, is to prevent their being mingled with evils, and thus perishing. When a man cannot be regenerated, the remains in him are carefully preserved in his 
interiors. But when a man is being regenerated, then, Insofar as this is the case, the remains are let down from the interiors into the exteriors, for the reason that by regeneration the interiors are 
conjoined with the exteriors and act as a one. Remains are then first let down to generals, and afterward successively to particulars. As the subject here treated of in the internal sense is the regeneration 
of the natural, it may be known from what has been said what is meant by remains being for what is general in the natural. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6156</b></p><p><b>6156.</b>
'That you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh' means that remnants are to be assigned to the general whole, which is under the control of the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'five' or 'a fifth' 
as remnants, dealt with in <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5894.htm">5894</a>; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the general whole within the natural, as above in <a href="6153.htm">6153</a>, the expression 'under the control of the internal' being used 
for the reason dealt with above in <a href="6145.htm">6145</a> For what remnants are, see <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, <a href="5135.htm">5135</a>, <a href="5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="5898.htm">5898</a>, where it is shown that they are goods and truths stored away by the Lord in the interior 
man. They are brought out into the exterior or natural man when a person is in a state of goodness; but they are withdrawn and stored away again the moment he passes into a state of evil. They are withdrawn 
and stored away again to prevent them from being mixed up with evils and thereby destroyed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 During the time that a person is Unable to be regenerated his remnants are held in safe keeping 
within him interiorly; but when he is being regenerated they are brought from his interiors - as many as are appropriate to the stage reached in his regeneration - into his exteriors, for the reason 
that through regeneration his interiors become joined to his exteriors and act in unison with them. Those remnants are assigned first to general wholes, then gradually to specific parts. From this one 
may see, since the subject here in the internal sense is the regeneration of the natural, what is meant by the assignment of those remnants to the general whole in the natural. </p>

`Et dabitis quintam Pharaoni':  quod significet reliquias quod illae ad commune quod sub auspicio interni, constat ex significatione `quinque' et `partis quintae' quod sint reliquiae, de qua n. 5291,5894; 
et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit commune in naturali, ut supra n. 6153; dicitur sub auspicio interni, ex causa de qua supra n. 6145:  quid reliquiae, videatur n. 1050, 1738, 1906,2284, 
5135,5897, 5898, quod nempe sint bona et vera a Domino in interiore  homine recondita; haec remittuntur in exteriorem seu naturalem hominem cum is in statu boni est, sed ilico cum is venit in statum 
 mali, retrahuntur et reconduntur; quod retrahantur et recondantur, est causa ne misceantur cum malis et sic pereant; [2] cum homo non regenerari potest, tunc reliquiae apud illum bene reservantur in 
interioribus; at cum homo regeneratur, tunc illae in tantum ab interioribus remittuntur in exteriora quantum regeneratur, ex causa quia per regenerationem interiora conjunguntur cum exterioribus et 
unum agunt; et tunc primum remittuntur ad communia, dein successive ad particularia; inde quia hic in sensu interno agitur de regeneratione naturalis, sciri potest quid intelligitur per quod reliquiae 
illae ad commune in naturali. </p>
