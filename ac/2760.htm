<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2760节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">序言（原拉丁文第三卷序言）</h4><br />那些拘守字义，不通过圣言中解释内义的其它经文寻求内义之人所受的迷惑是何等大啊。这一事实从大量异端邪说非常清楚地看出来，其中每个异端都通过圣言的字义来证明自己的信条。这从地狱般的疯狂我欲和物欲通过主对彼得所说的话而制造出的大异端尤其看得明显：<br />我告诉你：你是彼得，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上，阴间的门不能胜过它。我要把天国的钥匙给你，凡你在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑；凡你在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.19.htm">19</a>）<br />执着于字义的人以为这些话是指着彼得这个人说的，他被赋予了如此大的权柄。尽管他们十分清楚，彼得只是一个非常普通的人，他绝不会行使这样的权柄，并且行使这样的权柄违反神性。但由于充满地狱般的疯狂我欲和物欲，他们渴望将天上地上的权柄据为己有，使自己成为神明，于是便照字面解释这段话，还拼命扞卫它。可这些话的内义是：拥有这权柄的，是对主的信本身，然而也不是信，而是作为那信之源头的主，唯独那些拥有对主之爱和对邻之仁的人才拥有这样的信。在对“彼得”所说的这些话中，“磐石”表示那信，这在圣言别处也一样。教会就建立在那信上，阴间的门不能胜过它。那信拥有天国的钥匙，它关闭天堂，以防恶与假进入，并向善与真打开天堂。这就是这些话的内义。<br />十二使徒和以色列的十二支派一样，无非代表这信的各个方面（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节末尾）。彼得代表信本身，雅各代表仁爱，约翰代表仁之善（参看创世记18章序言）。在犹太人和以色列人的代表性教会中，雅各的三个大儿子，即流便、西缅和利未也一样，这一点从圣言中上千处经文清楚看出来。由于彼得代表信，故此处这些话是对他说的。由此明显可知，那些照字面解释一切的人使自己和同他们在一起的其他人陷入何等的黑暗之中；如那些从字面上解释对彼得所说的这些话，用来夺走主拯救人类的权柄，并将其据为己有之人所做的那样。<br />第22章<br /><br />2760.在约翰所写的启示录中，就其内义而言，圣言被描述如下：<br />我看见天开了，见有一匹白马。那骑马的称为忠信而真实，祂审判、争战都按着公义。祂的眼睛如火焰，祂头上戴着许多冠冕，又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道。祂穿着溅了血的衣服，祂的名称为神之道。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着：万王之王，万主之主。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.16.htm">16</a>）<br />若不藉着内义，没人知道这段描述的每一部分包含什么。显然，它们各自都具有代表性和灵义。如“天开了”，“白马”，“那骑马的称为忠信而真实”，“审判、争战都按着公义”；“祂的眼睛如火焰”，“祂头上戴着许多冠冕”，“又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道”，“祂穿着溅了血的衣服”，“在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂”，“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着”。通俗地说，骑白马的是圣言，祂就是主，也就是圣言。因为经上说“祂的名称为神之道”，然后又说“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着：万王之王，万主之主。”<br />从对每句话的解读明显可知，此处描述的是圣言的内义。“天开了”代表和表示圣言的内义只在天上能被看到，而天堂会向那些拥有对主之爱和源于这爱的对主之信的人敞开。“白马”代表和表示对圣言内在的理解或理解力；接下来的一段则表明“白马”具有这样的代表性和灵义。“那骑马的”是指圣言和为圣言的主，这是显而易见的。祂由于良善而称为“忠信”、“按着公义审判”，由于真理而称为“真实”、“按着公义争战”。“祂的眼睛如火焰”表从神性之爱发出的神圣良善的神圣真理。祂“头上戴着许多冠冕”表信的一切事物。“又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道”表除了主自己和祂所揭示给的人之外，没人明白圣言的内义是什么。“祂穿着溅了血的衣服”表字面上的圣言。“在天上的众军骑着白马跟随祂”表那些理解圣言内在内容的人。“穿着细麻衣，又白又洁”同样表这些具有爱和源于爱之信的人。“在祂衣服和大腿上写着”的名表真理与良善。从启示录中的这几节经文，以及前后文明显可知，圣言的内义将针对教会的末期被打开。那一章有几节（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.17.htm">19:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.21.htm">21</a>）还描述了教会末期所发生的事。</p>

CHAPTER 22            The Word as to its internal sense is thus described by John in Revelation: </p>
<p>     I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He who sat upon him was called faithful and 
true; and in righteousness He doth judge and make war. His eyes were a flame of fire; and upon His head were many diadems; and He had a name written which no one knew but He Himself; and He was clothed 
in a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies which are in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean. And He hath upon His 
garment and upon His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:11-14, 16). What each of these things involves no one can know except from the internal sense. It is manifest that 
every one of them is something representative and significative, as, that heaven was opened, that the horse was white, that He that sat upon him was faithful and true, and judgeth and maketh war in righteousness; 
that His eyes were a flame of fire, that upon His head were many diadems, that He had a name written which no one knew but He Himself, that He was clothed in a garment dipped in blood, that 
the armies which are in heaven followed Him upon white horses, that they were clothed in fine linen white and clean, and that He had upon His garment and upon His thigh a name written. It is said 
in plain words that it is the Word which is meant, and that it is the Lord who is the Word; for it is said, "His name is called the Word of God," and then, "He hath upon His garment and upon His thigh 
a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords."  [2] From the interpretation of each of the words it is manifest that the Word is here described as to its internal sense. "Heaven being opened," represents 
and signifies that the internal sense of the Word is not seen except in heaven, and by those to whom heaven is opened, that is, who are in love to the Lord and thence in faith in Him. The "horse 
which was white" represents and signifies the understanding of the Word as to its interiors; that a "white horse" is this will be manifest from what follows. That "He who sat upon him" is the Word, 
and the Lord who is the Word, is evident. He is called "faithful and judging from righteousness" on account of good, and "true and making war from righteousness" on account of truth. His "having upon 
His head many diadems," signifies all things of faith. His "having a name written which no one knew but He Himself," signifies that no one sees what the Word is in its internal sense but Himself, and 
he to whom He reveals it. "His being clothed in a garment dipped in blood," signifies the Word in the letter.  The "armies in the heavens which followed Him upon white horses," signify those who are 
in the understanding of the Word as to its interiors. "Clothed in fine linen white and clean," signifies the same in love and thence in faith. The "name written upon His garment and upon His thigh," 
signifies truth and good. From all this, and from what there precedes and follows, it is manifest that toward the last period the internal sense of the Word will be opened; but what will then come to 
pass is also described there (verses 17-21). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2760</b></p><p><b>2760.</b>
In John - in the Book of Revelation - the Word as to its internal sense is described as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw heaven standing open, and, behold, a White Horse; and He who sat on it was called faithful and 
true, and in righteousness He judges and goes into battle. His eyes a flame of fire, and on His head many jewels, He has a name written which nobody knows but He Himself, and He is clothed in a garment 
dyed with blood, and His name is called the Word of God. And the armies that are in heaven were following Him on white horses and were clothed in linen, white and clean. And on His garment and on 
His thigh He has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:%2011-14,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19: 11-14, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What each individual part of this description embodies nobody can know except from the internal sense. Plainly, 
each one is representative and carries a spiritual meaning, such as 'heaven standing open'; 'the horse which was white'; 'He who sat on it was called faithful and true, and in righteousness He judges 
and goes into battle'; 'His eyes a flame of fire'; 'on His head many jewels'; 'He has a name which nobody knows but He Himself'; 'He is clothed in a garment dyed with blood'; 'the armies in heaven following 
Him on white horses'; 'clothed in linen, white and clean'; 'on His garment and on His thigh He has a name written'. It is stated openly that the One sitting on the White Horse is the Word, and 
that He is the Lord who is the Word, for it is said, 'His name is called the Word of God', and after that, 'on His garment and on His thigh He has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
From the interpretation of each individual expression it is evident that the Word as to the internal sense is described here. 'Heaven standing open' represents and means that the internal sense of 
the Word is not seen except in heaven and by those to whom heaven stands open, that is, those in whom love to the Lord and faith in Him-derived from that love are present. 'The horse which was white' 
represents and means the understanding of the Word as regards its interior contents. The next paragraph shows that 'a white horse' has this representation and meaning. 'He who sat on it' is, it is clear, 
the Word and the Lord who is the Word. He is called 'faithful' and 'one who judges out of righteousness' by virtue of good, and 'true' and 'one who goes into battle out of righteousness' by virtue 
of truth; for the Lord Himself is righteousness. 'His eyes a flame of fire' means Divine Truth glowing from the Divine Good that issues from His Divine Love. 'On His head many jewels' means all things 
of faith. 'He has a name written which nobody knows but He Himself' means that nobody sees the essential nature of the Word in the internal sense except the Lord Himself and he to whom He reveals 
it. 'Clothed in a garment dyed with blood' means the Word in the letter. 'The armies in heaven that were following Him on white horses' means people who have an understanding of the Word as regards its 
interior contents. 'Clothed in linen, white and clean' means that in these same persons love and faith derived from love are present. 'On His garment and on His thigh a name written' means truth and 
good. From these verses in Revelation and from those which come before and after them it is evident that around the last period [of the Church] the internal sense of the Word will be opened. But what 
is going to happen in that last period is also described in verses 17-21 of that chapter. </p>

Apud Johannem in Apocalypsi describitur ita Verbum quoad sensum internum,      Vidi caelum apertum, ecce Equus Albus, et Qui sedens super      illo vocabatur fidelis et verus, et in justitia judicat 
et      pugnat: oculi Ipsius flamma ignis, et super capite Ipsius      diademata multa; habens nomen scriptum quod nemo novit nisi      Ipse: et circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine; et vocatur  
    nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei. Et exercitus, qui in {1}caelis,      sequebantur Ipsum super equis albis, induti byssino albo      mundo. . . . Et habet super vestimento et super femore Suo,    
  nomen scriptum, Rex regum, et Dominus dominorum, xix 11-14,      16. Quid singula haec involvunt, nemo scire potest nisi ex sensu interno; manifestum est quod unumquodvis aliquod repraesentativum 
et significativum sit, nempe `caelum quod apertum,' `equus qui albus,' `sedens super illo quod fidelis et verus, et in justitia judicans et pugnans,' quod `oculi Ipsius flamma ignis,' quod `super capite 
diademata multa,' quod `nomen haberet quod nemo novit nisi Ipse,' quod `circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine,' quod `exercitus qui in caelo sequerentur Ipsum super equis albis,' quod `illi induti 
byssino albo mundo,' et quod `super vestimento et super femore haberet nomen scriptum'; apertis verbis dicitur quod sit Verbum, et quod sit Dominus Qui Verbum, nam dicitur, `Vocatur nomen Ipsius Verbum 
Dei,' dein `habet super vestimento et super femore Suo nomen scriptum, Rex regum et Dominus dominorum.'  [2] Ex interpretatione singularum vocum patet quod hic describatur Verbum quoad sensum internum; 
quod `caelum sit apertum' repraesentat et significat quod internus sensus Verbi non videatur quam in caelo et ab illis quibus caelum est apertum, hoc est, qui in amore et inde fide in Dominum sunt: 
`equus qui albus' repraesentat et significat intellectum Verbi quoad interiora illius; quod equus albus id sit, patebit a sequentibus: `sedens super illo' quod sit Verbum et Dominus Qui Verbum, constat: 
`Qui fidelis et ex justitia judicans' vocatur ex bono, ac `verus et ex justitia pugnans' ex vero; {2}nam Ipse Dominus est justitia: `oculi ejus flamma ignis' significant Divinum Verum ex Divino 
Bono Divino Amoris Ipsius{2}: `super capite Ipsius diademata multa' significant omnia fidei: `habens nomen scriptum quod nemo novit nisi Ipse' significat quod quale sit Verbum in sensu interno, nemo 
videat quam Ipse et cui Ipse revelat: `circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine' significat Verbum in littera: `exercitus in {3}caelis qui sequebantur Ipsum super equis albis' significant illos qui in 
intellectu Verbi quoad interiora sunt: `induti byssino albo mundo' significat eosdem in amore et inde fide: `super vestimento et super femore nomen scriptum' significat verum et bonum.  Ex his et ex 
illis ibi quae praecedunt et sequuntur, patet quod circa ultimum tempus sensus internus Verbi aperietur; sed quid tunc eveniet, etiam describitur ibi vers. 17-21. @1 A has caelo, so also Sch and AR. 
De Equo Albo, a work published in 1758, which is an enlargement of this subject, has caelis.  11 lines lower down both A and I have caelo.$ @2 This passage is missing from A and I, but S inserts in 
De Equo Albo and in his own copy of AC.$ @3 caelo$ </p>
