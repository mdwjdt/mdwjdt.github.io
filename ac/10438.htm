<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10438</strong>.“祂领他们出去，是要降祸，把他们杀在山中”表那些处于良善的人将被毁灭。这从“领出去杀”和“山”的含义清楚可知：“领出去杀”是指毁灭，但当论及耶和华时，是指被他们自己的邪恶毁灭，因为耶和华从不毁灭任何人；“山”是指天堂，因而是指爱之良善。“山”表示天堂来源于来世的代表。大山、小山、岩石、山谷，以及其它许多物体出现在那里，和地上一样；那些住在属天之爱中的人在大山上，那些住在属灵之爱中的人住在小山上，那些住在信中的人在岩石上，那些尚未被提升到爱与信之良善的人在山谷中。<br />正因如此，“大山”表示那些处于属天之爱的良善，因而住在至内层天堂的人，在抽象意义上表示属天之爱的良善，因而表示住在这爱中的天堂；“小山”表示那些处于属灵之爱的良善，因而住在中间天堂的人，在抽象意义上表示这爱的良善和住在这爱中的天堂；“岩石”表示那些处于信之良善并由此住在最低层天堂的人，在抽象意义上表示这种良善和这种天堂；“山谷”表示那些尚未被提升到这些良善，因而被提升到天堂的人。这类物体因出现在来世，并因此表示这类真实事物，故在圣言中具有同样的含义，如迦南地的大山、小山、岩石和山谷，这地因此代表整体上的天堂。<br />“大山或山”表示属天之爱的良善所在的天堂，这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，如下列经文，以赛亚书：<br />在末后的日子，耶和华的山必在诸山之顶，高举过于万岭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.2.htm">2:2</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.1.htm">4:1</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />大山小山都要因公义带来平安。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.3.htm">72:3</a>）<br /><br />大山和一切小山都当赞美耶和华！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.8.htm">148:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.12.htm">12</a>）<br /><br />神的山是巴珊的山；诸岭的山是巴珊的山。诸山哪，诸山的诸岭，你们为何跳跃呢？神愿住在这山上；是的，耶和华必住这山，直到永远！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.15.htm">68:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.16.htm">16</a>）<br />申命记：<br />论到东方诸山初熟的果子和永恒山岭的宝物，愿它们都都临到约瑟头上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />除此之外还有其它地方（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="6435.htm">6435</a>，<a href="8327.htm">8327</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8758.htm">8758</a>，<a href="9422.htm">9422</a>，<a href="9434.htm">9434</a>节）。这一切解释了为何主降临到西乃山；为何大卫的城建在一座山上，这山被称为“西乃山”，表示至内层天堂；又为何古人在大山小山举行神圣的敬拜仪式（参看<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>节）。</p>

Into evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains. That this signifies that those who are in good will perish, is evident from the signification of "bringing forth to slay," as being to 
destroy; but when said of Jehovah, who never destroys anyone, it denotes to perish by their own evil; and from the signification of "mountains," as being heaven, and from this the good of love. That 
by "mountains" is signified heaven, is from the representatives in the other life; for there, as upon earth, appear mountains, hills, rocks, valleys, and many other things; and upon the mountains are 
those who are in celestial love, upon the hills those who are in spiritual love, upon the rocks those who are in faith, and in the valleys those who have not as yet been carried up to the good of love 
and of faith.  [2] From this it is that by "mountains" are signified those who are in the good of celestial love, thus who are in the inmost heaven, and in the abstract sense the goods of celestial 
love, thus the heaven which is in this love; that by "hills" are signified those who are in the good of spiritual love, thus who are in the middle heaven, and in the abstract sense the good of this love 
and the heaven which is in it; that by "rocks" are signified those who are in the good of faith and from this are in the ultimate heaven, and in the abstract sense this good and this heaven; and that 
by "valleys" are signified those who have not yet been carried up to these goods, thus to heaven. As such things appear in the other life, consequently such things are signified by them, therefore 
similar things are signified by them in the Word, and similar things are signified by the mountains, hills, rocks, and valleys in the land of Canaan, by which land was therefore represented heaven in 
its complex. [3] That "mountains" signify the heaven where is the good of celestial love, is manifest from many passages in the Word, as from the following: </p>
<p>     In the futurity of days the mountain 
of Jehovah shall be at the head of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills (Isa. 2:2; Micah 4:1).      The mountains shall bring peace, and the hills in righteousness (Ps. 72:3).      
Praise Jehovah ye mountains, and all hills (Ps. 148:9).      A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is the mountain of Bashan. Why leap ye, ye mountains, ye hills of mountains; 
God did desire to dwell in it; Jehovah also shall dwell forever (Ps. 68:15, 16).      Concerning the chief things of the mountains of the east, and concerning the precious things of the hills of 
an age; let them come on the head of Joseph (Deut. 33:15, 16); </p>
<p>besides in other places (see n. 795, 6435, 8327, 8658, 8758, 9422, 9434). It is for this reason that the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai, 
and it is for this reason that the city of David was built upon a mountain, and that this mountain, which was called "Mount Zion," signifies the inmost heaven; and for this reason also it is that the 
ancients performed the holy rites of worship upon mountains and hills (see n. 2722). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10438</b></p><p><b>10438.</b>
'For evil He led them out, to kill them in the mountains' means that those with whom good exists will be destroyed. This is clear from the meaning of 'leading out to kill' as destroying, though when 
such words are used in reference to Jehovah, who never destroys anyone, being destroyed by their own evil is meant; and from the meaning of 'the mountains' as heaven, consequently the good of love. The 
origin of the meaning of 'the mountains' as heaven lies in representatives in the next life. Mountains, hills, rocks, valleys, and many more objects appear there, as on earth; and on the mountains there 
are those who abide in celestial love, on the hills those who abide in spiritual love, on the rocks those who abide in faith, and in the valleys those who have not as yet been raised up to the good 
of love and faith. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Consequently by 'mountains' those in whom the good of celestial love exists, and so who inhabit the inmost heaven, are meant, and in the abstract sense forms of the good of celestial 
love, and so the heaven which abides in that love; by 'hills' those in whom the good of spiritual love exists, and so who inhabit the middle heaven, are meant, and in the abstract sense the good 
of that love and the heaven which abides in it; by 'rocks' those in whom the good of faith exists, and who consequently inhabit the lowest heaven, are meant, and in the abstract sense that good and 
that heaven; and by 'valleys' those who have not as yet been raised up to those kinds of good and so to heaven are meant. Because such objects appear in the next life and such realities are consequently 
meant by them, those objects have a like meaning in the Word, as do the mountains, hills, rocks, and valleys in the land of Canaan, by which heaven in its entirety was therefore represented.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
The fact that the heaven where the good of celestial love exists is meant by 'mountains' is evident from a large number of places in the Word, such as the following: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the latter days 
it will be, that the mountain of Jehovah will be on the top of the mountains, and raised above the hills. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%202:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 2:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%204:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 4:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The mountains will bring peace, and the hills, in righteousness. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2072:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 72:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Praise Jehovah, mountains and all hills. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20148:7,9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 148:7,9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is 
the mountain of Bashan. Why do you leap up, O mountains, hills of mountains? God desires to inhabit it; yes, Jehovah will inhabit it perpetually. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:15,16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:15,16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
... in regard to the 
firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and to the precious things of the everlasting hills<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> ... Let them come upon the head of Joseph. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:15,16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:15,16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Other places besides these contain the same 
meaning, see <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="8327.htm">8327</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8758.htm">8758</a>, <a href="9422.htm">9422</a>, <a href="9434.htm">9434</a>. All this explains why the Lord came down onto Mount Sinai; why the city of David was built on a mountain, and that mountain, which was called Mount 
Zion, means the inmost heaven; and also why the ancients performed holy acts of worship on mountains and hills, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>.

`In malum eduxit illos ad occidendum illos in montibus':  quod significet quod perituri qui in {1}bono, constat ex significatione `educere ad occidendum' quod sit perdere, at cum de Jehovah Qui nusquam 
aliquem perdit, est perire a suo malo; et ex significatione `montium' quod sint caelum, inde bonum amoris; quod per `montes' significetur caelum, est a repraesentativis in altera vita, apparent enim 
ibi, sicut in terra, montes, (t)colles, petrae, valles, et plura, et {2}super montibus sunt qui in amore caelesti, supra collibus qui in amore spirituali, {2}super petris qui in fide, et in vallibus 
qui nondum ad bonum amoris et fidei evecti sunt; [2] inde est quod per `montes' significentur qui in bono amoris caelestis, ita qui in intimo caelo, ac in sensu abstracto bona amoris caelestis, {3}ita 
caelum, quod in illo {4}amore est; quodque per `colles' significentur qui in bono amoris spiritualis sunt, ita qui in medio caelo, ac in sensu abstracto bonum illius amoris, ac caelum quod in illo; 
et quod per `petras' significentur qui in bono fidei, et inde qui in caelo ultimo, ac in sensu abstracto id bonum et id caelum; tum quod per `valles' significentur qui nondum ad illa bona, ita ad caelum 
evecti sunt; quia talia apparent in altera vita, et inde talia significantur per illa, ideo similia per (c)illa significantur in Verbo; ac similia per montes, colles, petras, et valles in terra Canaane, 
per quam ideo repraesentatum est caelum in suo complexu. 	[3] Quod `montes' significent caelum, ubi bonum amoris caelestis, patet a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut ab his sequentibus: apud Esaiam, 
 	In posteritate dierum erit mons Jehovae in caput montium, et elatus prae collibus, ii 2; Mich. iv 1: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Ferent montes pacem, et colles in justitia, Ps. (x)lxxii 3:  apud eundem, 	Laudate 
Jehovam, montes et omnes colles, Ps. cxlviii (x)7, 9:  apud eundem, 	Mons Dei mons Baschanis, mons collium mons Baschanis; quare  subsilitis montes, colles montium? desiderat Deus inhabitare 
illum, etiam Jehovah habitabit in perpetuum, Ps. lxviii 16, 17 [A.V.15, 16]: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, 	De primitiis montium orientis, et de pretiosis collium {5}saeculi, veniant capiti Josephi, Deut. xxxiii 15, 
16; </p>
<p>praeter aliis in locis, videatur n. 795, 6435, 8327, 8658, 8758, 9422, 9434. Inde est quod Dominus descenderit super montem Sinai, et inde est quod urbs Davidis aedificata fuerit super monte, et 
quod ille mons, qui mons {6}Zion vocabatur, (x)significet intimum {7}caelum; et quoque inde est quod antiqui super montibus et collibus sanctum cultus habuerint, n. 2722. @1 coelis$ @2 supra$ @3
