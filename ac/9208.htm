<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9208.</strong>出埃及记22:24-26.你若借银钱给我的人民，给与你同住的贫穷人，对他不可像放债的，不可向他取利息。你若真拿同伴的衣服作抵押，必在日落以先还给他；因为这是他唯一的遮盖物，是他遮皮肤的衣服，使他可以在里头睡觉；将来他向我呼求，我就垂听，因为我是仁慈的。<br />“你若借银钱给我的人民，给与你同住的贫穷人”表教导那些不知道真理，却渴望学习的人。“对他不可像放债的”表必须出于仁爱而如此行。“不可向他取利息”表决不可为了从中谋利而如此行。“你若真拿同伴的衣服作抵押”表如果记忆真理被感官印象产生的幻觉驱散。“必在日落以先还给他”表必须在外在之爱的快乐所诱发的一种阴影状态到来之前恢复它。“因为这是他唯一的遮盖物”表因为感官印象在内层事物之下的一个层面上。“是他遮皮肤的衣服”表它们也覆盖外层事物。“使他可以在里头睡觉”表停靠在它们上面。“将来他向我呼求”表向主祈求。“我就垂听”表帮助。“因为我是仁慈的”表这种帮助完全来自祂，是出于怜悯。</p>

Verses 24-26. If thou shalt lend silver to My people, the needy with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer; ye shall not put usury upon him. If taking a pledge thou shalt take in pledge thy companion's 
garment, even at the going in of the sun thou shalt restore it to him; for it is his only covering; it is his garment for his skin, wherein he may sleep; and it shall be, when he shall cry unto 
Me, that I will hear; for I am merciful. "If thou shalt lend silver to My people, the needy with thee," signifies the instruction of those who are in ignorance of truth, and yet long to learn; "thou 
shalt not be to him as a usurer," signifies that this must be done from charity; "ye shall not put usury upon him," signifies not for the sake of the consequent profit; "if taking a pledge thou shalt 
take in pledge thy companion's garment," signifies if memory-truth be separated through fallacies derived from the things of sense; "even at the going in of the sun thou shalt restore it to him," signifies 
that it must be restored before there is a state of shade from the delights of external loves; "for it is his only covering," signifies because the things of sense underlie interior things; "it 
is his garment for his skin," signifies that they also clothe exterior things; "wherein he may sleep," signifies rest upon them; "and it shall be when he shall cry unto Me," signifies supplication to 
the Lord; "that I will hear," signifies aid; "for I am merciful," signifies that from Him is everything of aid, from mercy. </p>

Verses 25-27 If you lend silver to My people, to the needy one with you, you shall not be like a money-lender to him; you shall not charge him interest. If you ever take your companion's clothing as 
a pledge you shall restore it to him even at the going in of the sun. For this is his only covering; it is his clothing for his skin, in which he may sleep; and it shall be, when he cries out to Me, that 
I shall hear, for I am merciful.  </p>
<p>'If you lend silver to My people, to the needy one with you' means giving instruction to those who have no knowledge of truth and still have a desire to learn 
it. 'You shall not be like a money-lender' means that it must be done in a spirit of charity. 'You shall not charge him interest' means that therefore it must not be done for the sake of gain to be acquired 
from it. 'If you ever take your companion's clothing as a pledge' means if factual knowledge of truth is dispersed by illusions that are a product of sensory impressions. 'You shall restore it 
to him even at the going in of the sun' means that it is to be restored before the arrival of a state of shade induced by delights belonging to external kinds of love. 'For this is his only covering' 
means because sensory impressions lie on a level below more internal things. 'It is his clothing for his skin' means that they also clothe relatively external things. 'In which he may sleep' means resting 
on them. 'When he cries out to Me' means pleading to the Lord. 'I shall hear' means help. 'For I am merciful' means that such help comes wholly from Him, out of mercy.  </p>

Vers. 24-26.  Si argentum mutuo dederis populo Meo, egeno cum te, non ejus ei sicut faenerator; non ponetis super illum usurams.  Si oppignerando oppigneraveris vestem socii tui, usque ad intrare solii 
restitues illam ei.  Quia illa tegumentum ejus solum, illud vestis ejus cut ejus, in qua dormiat; et erit, quando (x)clamaverit ad Me, et audiam, quia misericors Ego.  `Si argentum mutuo dederis populo 
Meo egeno cum te' significat instructionem (c)(x)eorum qui in ignorantia veri et usque in desiderio discendi: `non eris sicut faenerator' significat quod ex charitate id fiet: `non ponetis super 
illo usuram' significat quod sic non propter lucrum inde: {1} `si oppignerando oppigneraveris vestem socii tui' significat si {2} verum scientificum per fallacias ex sensualibus disparetur: `usque ad 
intrare solis restitues ei' significat quod restituendum ante statum umbrae ex jucundis amorum externorum: 'quia illa (x)tegumentum ejus solum' significat quia sensualia interioribus substrata sunt: 
`illud vestis ejus cuti ejus' significat quod etiam exteriora investiant: `in qua dormiat' significat quietem super illis {3}: `quando clamaverit ad Me' significat supplicationem ad Dominum: `et audiam' 
significat opem: `quia misericors Ego' significat quod (c)ex Ipso omne opis ex misericordia. @1 explicetur Matth. ix 17, Luc. v 37, 38, Marc. ii 12 written in m, but see n. 9212 where only Luc. v 
36 is expounded.$ @2 vera scientifica... disparentur altered to verum scientificum... disparetur cp n. 9212$ @3 cutis sensualia dormiunt quoque written in m, cp n. 9216.$ </p>
