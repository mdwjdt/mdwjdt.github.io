<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3829节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3829.</strong>“雅各对拉班说，请把我的女人给我”表总体良善现在要与内层真理情感结合。这从“雅各”的代表清楚可知，“雅各”是指属世层的良善，如前所述，在这种情况下是指总体良善，因为属世层的事物相对于内在事物来说是总体的。事实上，数不清的事物从内在人流入属世人或外在人，它们在那里作为一个总的整体出现，当构成总的整体的具体事物还没有被接受时，更是如此，此处便是这种情形。因此，“雅各”所代表的良善现在被称为总体良善。显然，所表示的是与内层真理情感的结合，因为此处“我的女人”所指的“拉结”代表对内层真理的情感，如前所示。 </p>

And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my woman.* That this signifies that from general good there was now conjunction with the affection of interior truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as 
being the good of the natural (concerning which see above); in the present case general good, because the things of the natural are relatively general, there being innumerable things which flow from 
the internal man into the natural or external man which appear in this latter as one general thing, and still more so before the particulars of the generals have been received, as in the present case. 
For this reason the good which is represented by Jacob is now called general good. That conjunction with the affection of interior truth is signified, is manifest, for Rachel, who is here called "my 
woman," represents the affection of interior truth, as before shown. * Although the term "woman" in this connection is offensive to the ears of English speaking people, it is necessary to keep to the 
word that is used in the original, which is mulier and not uxor. Moreover Rachel and Leah were not the wives of Jacob, but merely his "women," because there is no marriage possible except that of "one 
man with one wife" (Arcana Coelestia n. 1907), and Jacob was a polygamist. [Reviser.] </p>

'Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife' means that general good was now to be joined to the affection for interior truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the good of the natural, dealt 
with already, in this case general good because the things that constitute the natural are general in comparison with internal things. For countless things flow in from the internal man into the 
natural or external man where they manifest themselves as a general whole, the more so when the particular things that make up general wholes have not yet been received, as is the case here. This is why 
the good which 'Jacob' represents is now called general good. The joining of this good to the affection for interior truth is clearly meant, for Rachel, to whom 'my wife' refers here, represents the 
affection for interior truth, as shown above. </p>

</p><b>3829.</b>
`Dixit Jacob ad Labanem, Da mulierem meam':  quod significet quod a bono communi nunc conjunctio cum affectione veri interioris, constat a repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum naturalis, de qua 
prius, hic bonum commune {1}quia quae naturalis  sunt, communia respective sunt, sunt enim innumerabilia quae ab interno homine influunt in naturalem seu externum, quae in hoc apparent ut commune 
unum, et adhuc magis antequam particularia communium recepta sunt, ut hic; inde est quod bonum quod per `Jacobum' repraesentatur, nunc dicatur bonum commune; quod sit conjunctio cum affectione veri 
interioris, constat nam Rachel, quae hic est `mulier mea,' repraesentat affectionem veri interioris, ut supra ostensum. </p>
