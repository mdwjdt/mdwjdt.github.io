<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第816节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>816.</strong>由于仇恨和报复的属不计其数，它们的种类更是数不胜数，而且没有哪两个属的地狱是一样的，相应地，要依次数算它们当中的每一个是不可能的，所以我来讲述一下我的所见所闻。有一个人向我走来，看上去象是贵族（我凭内在视觉能看到出现在我面前的精灵（灵），就象在大白天一样看得清楚，甚至更清楚，因为主的恩典使我得以与精灵来往）。第一次走近时，他用手势示意，假装有很多话想跟我交流，并问我是不是基督徒，我回应说是。他说他也是，并要求单独和我相处，告诉我一些别人听不到的事。不过，我说，在来生（灵界），人们无法象在世时那样单独相处，有很多精灵（灵）在场。然而，他走得越来越近，并悄悄绕到我背后。这时，我发觉他是一个刺客。当他在那里时，我感觉一种刺痛穿过心脏，随即进入大脑，人很容易因这种刺痛而毙命。不过，由于我得到主的保护，所以一点也不怕。我不知道他用了什么方法。他以为我死了，于是跟别人说，他刚从一个他以这种方式杀死的人那里来，他是从后面给予致命一击的。他声称自己深谙此道，受害者在倒下死亡之前什么也不知道，没人质疑他的无辜。我由此得知他离世不久，并且在世时就做过这种坏事。对这种人的惩罚是非常可怕的。长时间地遭受地狱般的折磨后，他们的脸最终变得令人厌恶，并且奇形怪状，以致它不再是一张脸，而是看似肮脏的黄绳样的东西。他们就这样丧失人的一切，凡看到他们的人无不吓得浑身发抖。于是，他们象野兽一样在黑暗的地方四处游荡。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]816.</strong> The different general kinds of hatred and vengefulness are beyond counting, the specific kinds still more so, and the hell for one kind is not the same as the hell for another. So it is impossible to list each in order. For this reason, let me simply report on some examples I have seen.<br />One spirit who seemed to be a noble came to me. (Spirits have appeared to me as if in clear daylight, and even more clearly than that, but to my inner eye, since the Lord in his divine mercy has let me interact with them.) As soon as he arrived, he pretended, by sly nodding, to show that he had many things he wanted to share with me, asking whether I was a Christian. I answered yes. He said he was, too, and asked to be alone with me so that he could tell me something privately. "In this life," I answered, "no one can be alone, the way people on earth think they can. Many other spirits are close by."<br />He came nearer anyway, stealing up from behind to the back of my head. I could then tell that he was an assassin. While he was there I felt a stab to the heart and then to the brain — the kind a person could easily die from. But because the Lord was keeping me safe, I was unafraid. What trick he was using I cannot say.<br />Thinking I was dead, he told some other spirits that he had just come from a murder victim of his, one to whom he had dealt a fatal blow from behind. He claimed a skill at keeping people from knowing what was happening until they fell dead, and from suspecting he was anything but innocent. From this I could tell that he had recently departed life, where he had committed the same kind of crime.<br />The punishment of such spirits is horrible. After enduring ages of hellish torment, they end up with faces so loathsome, so shockingly deformed, that they are not faces but almost like flax, drained of all color. In other words, these spirits strip themselves of everything human; then everyone who sees them shudders at the sight. Consequently they wander in the shadows like wild animals. </p>

As there are innumerable genera of hatreds and revenges, and species still more innumerable, and one genus has not the same hell as another, and as it is therefore impossible to recount them singly in 
their order, I may refer to what have been seen. One came to me who appeared to be a noble. (Those who appeared to me were seen as in clear daylight, and even more clearly, but by my internal sight; 
for of the Lord's Divine mercy it has been given me to be in company with spirits.) At his first approach he pretended by signs that he had much he wished to communicate to me, asking whether I was a 
Christian; to which I replied that I was. He said that he was too, and asked that he might be alone with me, to tell me something that others might not hear. But I answered that in the other life people 
cannot be alone, as men think they are on earth, and that many spirits were present. He now came nearer and approached stealthily behind me to the back of my head, and then I perceived that he was 
an assassin. While he was there I felt as it were a stab through the heart, and presently in the brain-such a blow as might easily be the death of a man. But as I was protected by the Lord, I feared 
nothing. What device he used I do not know. Thinking me dead, he told others that he had just come from a man whom he had killed in that way, and by a deadly stroke from behind, saying that he was so 
skillful in the art that a man would not know until he fell down dead, and it would not be doubted that he himself was innocent. It was given me to know from this that he had but lately departed from 
life, where he had committed such a deed. The punishment of such is dreadful. After they have suffered infernal torments for ages, they at length come to have a detestable and most monstrous face-such 
as is not a face, but a ghastly thing as of tow. Thus they put off everything human, and then everyone shudders at the sight of them, and so they wander about like wild beasts, in dark places. </p>

Since the genera of hatred and revenge are countless, and the species of them even more countless, and since the hell of one genus is never like that of another, and it is accordingly impossible to number 
every single one of them in order, let me therefore relate what I have seen. Someone came to me who looked like a nobleman. (Spirits have appeared to me as in broad daylight, and in light even brighter. 
They have done so however before my internal sight, since the Lord's Divine mercy has allowed me into the presence of spirits.) On his first arrival that man pretended by beckoning movements 
to have many matters he wished to convey to me. He asked whether I was a Christian, and I replied that I was. He asserted that he was too, and asked to be alone with me, to tell me something that others 
were not to hear. But I replied that in the next life people are unable to be alone in the way people imagine they are on earth, and that many spirits were present. He drew closer however and went 
round behind my back, at which point I perceived that he was an assassin. While he was there I felt a kind of stab through the heart, and immediately after that in the brain, the kind of stab from which 
someone would easily die. But because I was protected by the Lord I feared nothing. What method he used I do not know. Thinking that I was dead he told others that he had just left someone whom he 
had killed in this manner - and indeed by a fatal blow from behind - and he said that he was skilled in a method by which the victim knew nothing before falling down dead, and one by which nobody would 
doubt his innocence. From this I was given to know that he had recently departed this earthly life where he had performed such villainy. The punishment of such people is horrifying. After they have 
undergone hellish tortures for ages their face at length becomes abhorrent and utterly grotesque, so that it is not a face any more but something that looks like dirty yellow rope. In this way they lose 
everything human, at which point everyone shudders at the sight of them. As a consequence they roam around like wild animals in gloomy places. </p>

</p><b>816.</b>
Quia odiorum et vindictarum genera innumera sunt, et species innumerabiliores, et unum genus non simile infernum ac alterum habet, et sic impossibile est in ordine singula recensere, quare licet referre 
quae visa sunt. Unus ad me venit, visus sicut nobilis: (apparuerunt mihi sicut in clara die, et adhuc clarius, sed coram visu interno, quia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, datum interesse spiritibus) 
is ad primum adventum simulate per nutus insinuabat quod multa haberet quae vellet mecum communicare, interrogans num Christianus essem; cui respondebam quod essem.  Se similiter esse aiebat, rogans 
ut solus mecum esset, se aliquid narraturum quod alii non audirent; sed respondebam quod in altera vita soli esse nequeant, sicut homines se putant esse in terra, et quod plures spiritus adessent; 
sed propius accessit et subiit ad occipitium ad tergum; percipiebam tunc quod sicarius esset; cumque ibi esset, sentiebam tanquam ictum per cor, et mox in cerebro, ex quali ictu facile moriturus homo; 
sed quia tutus a Domino, nihil metuebam; qua arte usus non scio; is putans quod ego mortuus, dixit ad alios quod venerit nunc ab homine, quem occiderit ita, et quidem per exitiale quoddam a tergo, dicens 
quod calleret artem quod homo nesciret priusquam succumbat mortuus, et quod is non aliter crederetur quam quod insons.  Inde scire datum, quod is nuper e vita decesserit, ubi tale facinus patravit. 
Talium punitio est horrenda; postquam infernales cruciatus per saecula subierint, tandem fiunt facie detestabili et monstrosissima, sic ut non facies, sed quoddam quasi stuppeum luridum; ita exuunt 
omne humanum; tunc unusquisque eos horrescit, qui videt, quare sicut ferae in locis opacis vagantur. </p>
