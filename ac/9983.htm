<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9983节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9983.</strong>系真正良善的良善必是出于对良善的爱而行出的，因而必是为了良善的缘故而行出的。处于这爱的人厌恶功德，因为他们喜欢行善，从行善当中获得快乐的感觉。另一方面，若有为了某种自私的原因而行善的想法，他们就会感到悲伤。他们极像那些为了友情而向朋友行善，为了弟兄而向弟兄行善，为了妻儿而向妻儿行善，或为了国家而向国家行善的人，因而极像那些出于友情和爱而行事的人。那些思维健全的人也强调说，他们行善不是为了自己的缘故，而为了其他人的利益。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9983</b></p><p><b>9983.</b>
To do good that is good must be from the love of good, thus for the sake of good. They who are in this love abhor merit, for they love to do, and perceive satisfaction from it; and on the other hand, 
they are saddened if it is believed that it is done for the sake of something of self. The case herein is almost as it is with those who do what is good to friends for the sake of friendship, to a brother 
for the sake of brotherhood, to wife and children for their own sake, to their country for their country's sake; thus from friendship and from love. They who think well also say and insist that 
they do not do well for the sake of themselves; but for the sake of those to whom they do it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9983</b></p><p><b>9983.</b>
Good that is truly good must be done from a love of good, thus must be done for its own sake. People governed by that love detest merit, for they love to do it and derive feelings of delight out of 
doing it. On the other hand they are saddened if there is any thought that it is done for some selfish reason. The situation with them is very much like that with people who do good to a friend for friendship's 
sake, to a brother for brotherhood's sake, to wife and children for wife and children's sake, or to their country for their country's sake, thus people who act for reasons of friendship and 
love. Those who are sound in their thinking also say emphatically that they do good not for their own but other people's benefit.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9983</b>
</p><b>9983.</b>
Facere bonum quod est bonum, erit ex amore boni, ita propter bonum; qui in illo amore sunt abhorrent meritum, nam amant facere, et inde faustum percipiunt; et vice versa, contristantur si credatur quod 
fiat propter aliquid sui. Se habent illa paene sicut qui bonum faciunt amicis amicitiae causa, fratri fraternitatis causa, uxori et liberis uxoris et liberorum causa, patriae patriae causa, ita ex 
amicitia et ex amore; qui bene cogitant etiam dicunt et persuadent quod non benefaciant propter se sed propter illos. </p>
