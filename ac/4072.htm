Verses 4-13. And Jacob sent, and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock. And he said unto them, I see your father's faces, that he is not at all toward me as yesterday and the day before; 
and the God of my father hath been with me. And ye know that with all my strength I have served your father. And your father hath deceived me, and hath changed my reward ten ways, and God hath not suffered 
him to do evil with me. If he said thus, The party-colored shall be thy reward, then all the flock bore party-colored, speckled, and grizzled. And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob; 
and I said, Behold me! And he said, Lift up I pray thine eyes, and see all the he-goats which leap upon the flock, party-colored, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto 
thee. I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me; now arise, go forth out of this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity. "And Jacob sent, and called 
Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock," signifies the adjunction of the affections of truth by the good now meant by "Jacob," and application at the time when it departed; "and he said unto 
them, I see your father's faces, that he is not at all toward me as yesterday and the day before," signifies a change of state in the good signified by "Laban;" "and the God of my father hath been with 
me," signifies that all things which He had were from the Divine; "and ye know that with all my strength I have served your father," signifies that it was of His own power; "and your father hath deceived 
me; and hath changed my reward ten ways," signifies the state of good toward Himself, when of Himself He applied the things of that good, and its very great change; "and God hath not suffered him 
to do evil with me," signifies that still it could not hinder; "if he said thus, The speckled shall be thy reward, then all the flock bore speckled," signifies His freedom, and that in His freedom 
those things were taken by the Lord, even to evils that were adjoined to the goods; "and if he said thus, The party-colored shall be thy reward, then all the flock bore party-colored," signifies the same 
in the case of the falsities that were adjoined; "and God hath taken away the acquisition of your father, and hath given it to me," signifies that these were from the Divine; "and it came to pass 
at the time that the flock grew warm," signifies the ardor of affection that they might be conjoined; "that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream," signifies the perception of natural good in obscurity; 
"and behold the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were party-colored, speckled, and grizzled," signifies the effect that the natural good meant by "Jacob" should be imbued with such things from 
that source; "and the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob; and I said, Behold me!" signifies perception from the Divine, and presence in that obscure state; "and he said, Lift up I pray 
thine eyes," signifies attention thereto from that which was His own; "and see all the he-goats which leap upon the flock, party-colored, speckled, and grizzled," signifies that such things should be 
introduced; "for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee," signifies the own of the good signified by "Laban," that it is not such as to act from itself; "I am the God of Bethel," signifies the Divine 
in the natural; "where thou anointedst a pillar," signifies where the good of truth is, and its boundary; "where thou vowedst a vow unto me," signifies what is holy; "now arise," signifies elevation; 
"go forth out of this land," signifies separation from that good; "and return unto the land of thy nativity," signifies conjunction with the Divine good of truth. </p>

Verses 4-13 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock. And he said to them, I see your father's face, that it is not at all friendly towards me as before;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the God of my 
father has been with me. And you yourselves know that with all my strength I have served your father. And your father has deceived me, and has changed my wages in ten ways, and God has not allowed him 
to do evil to me. If he said thus: The speckled will be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: The variegated will be your wages, then all the flocks bore variegated. And 
God has taken away your father's cattle and given them to me. And it happened, when the flock came on heat, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the he-goats mounting the flock 
were variegated, speckled, and mottled. And the angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob. And I said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Lift up now your eyes, and see all the he-goats mounting the flock, 
variegated, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you. I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now rise up, go out of this 
land, and return to the land of your nativity. </p>
<p>'Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock' means a linking of the affections for truth to the good now meant by 'Jacob' - 
achieved by that good itself; also the use to which those affections were applied when that good departed. 'And he said to them, I see your father's face, that it is not at all friendly towards me as 
before' means a change of state within the good meant by 'Laban'. 'And the God of my father has been with me' means that the Divine was the author of all that He had. 'And you yourselves know that with 
all my strength I have served your father' means that He acted by His own power. 'And your father has deceived me, and has changed my wages in ten ways' means the state of good in relation to Himself 
when, acting of Himself, He applied to Himself the things which constituted that good, and also a very great change in that good. 'And God has not allowed him to do evil to me' means that it was nevertheless 
unable to cause any hindrance. 'If he said thus: The speckled will be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled' means His freedom, and that in His freedom the Lord adopted those things 
- even evils that were linked to the goods. 'And if he said thus: The variegated will be your wages, then all the flocks bore variegated' means even falsities that were linked to them. 'And God has taken 
away your father's cattle and given them to me' means that those things came from the Divine. 'And it happened, when the flock came on heat' means an intense desire to be joined together. 'That I 
lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream' means the perception of natural good when in obscurity. 'And behold, the he-goats mounting the flock were variegated, speckled, and mottled' means the effect that 
was produced when natural good meant by 'Jacob' was endowed with such things from this source. 'And the angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob. And I said, Behold, here I am' means perception from 
the Divine, and presence within that state of obscurity. 'And he said, Lift up now your eyes' means observation from what was His own. 'And see all the he-goats mounting the flock, variegated, speckled, 
and mottled' means that such things were being introduced. 'For I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you' means that the proprium of the good meant by 'Laban' was not such as acted of itself. 
'I am the God of Bethel' means the Divine within the Natural. 'Where you anointed a pillar' means where the good of truth exists, and the boundary of it. 'Where you made a vow to Me' means that which 
is holy. 'Now rise up' means a raising up. 'Go out of this land' means a separation from that good. 'And return to the land of your nativity' means becoming joined to the Divine Good of Truth.

Vers. 4-13.  Et misit Jacob et vocavit Rachelem et Leam agrum ad gregem suum.  Et dixit illis, Video ego facies patris vestri, quod nullatenus is ad me sicut heri nudius tertius; et Deus patris mei 
fuit cum me.  Et vos scitis quod in omni vi mea servivi patri vestro.  Et pater vester fefellit me, et mutavit mercedem meam decem modis, et non dedit ei Deus ad malefaciendum mecum.  Si sic dicebat, 
Punctata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes greges punctata; et si sic dicebat, Variegata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes greges variegata.  Et eripuit Deus acquisitionem patris vestri, 
et dedit mihi.  Et factum in tempore incalescendi gregem, et sustuli oculos meos, et vidi in somnio, et ecce hirci ascendentes super gregem variegati, punctati et grandinati.  Et dixit ad me angelus 
Dei in somnio, Jacob; et dixi, Ecce me.  Et dixit, Tolle quaeso oculos tuos, et vide omnes hircos ascendentes super gregem variegatos, punctatos et grandinatos, quia vidi omne quod Laban facit 
tibi.  Ego Deus Bethelis, quo unxisti statuam, quo vovisti Mihi votum, nunc surge, exi e terra hac, et revertere ad terram nativitatis tuae. `Misit Jacob et vocavit Rachelem et Leam agrum ad gregem 
suum' significat adjunctionem affectionum veri a bono per Jacobum nunc intellecto, et applicationem tunc cum discederet: `et dixit illis, Video ego facies patris vestri, quod nullatenus is ad me sicut 
heri nudius tertius' significat status mutationem in bono per Labanem significato: `et Deus patris mei fuit cum me' significat quod a Divino omnia quae Sibi: `et vos scitis quod in omni vi mea 
servivi patri vestro' significat quod ex propria potentia: `et pater vester fefellit me, et mutavit mercedem meam decem modis' significat statum boni ad Se, cum ex Se Ipso applicaret illa quae boni 
istius, et plurimam mutationem ejus: `et non dedit ei Deus ad malefaciendum mecum' significat quod usque non impedire potuerit: `si sic dicebat, Punctata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes greges 
punctata' significat liberum ejus, et quod in libero ejus sumerentur illa a Domino, haec quoad mala adjuncta bonis: `et si sic dicebat, Variegata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes greges variegata' 
significat eadem quoad falsa adjuncta: `et eripuit Deus acquisitionem patris vestri, et dedit mihi' significat quod illa ex Divino: `et factum in tempore incalescendi gregem' significat affectionis 
ardorem ut conjungerentur: `et sustuli oculos meos, et vidi in somnio' significat perceptionem naturalis boni in obscuro: `et ecce hirci ascendentes super gregem variegati, punctati et grandinati' 
significat effectum quod bonum naturale per Jacob intellectum talibus inde imbueretur: `et dixit ad me angelus Dei in somnio, Jacob; et dixi, Ecce me' significat perceptionem ex Divino, et 
praesentiam in statu illo obscuro: `et dixit, Tolle quaeso oculos tuos' significat advertentiam ex proprio: `et vide omnes hircos ascendentes super gregem variegatos, punctatos et grandinatos' significat 
quod talia introducerentur: `quia vidi omne quod Laban facit tibi' significat proprium boni per Labanem significati, non tale ut ex se: `Ego Deus Bethelis' significat Divinum in naturali: `quo 
unxisti statuam' significat ubi bonum veri, et terminus: `quo vovisti Mihi votum' significat sanctum: </p>
<p>nunc surge' significat elevationem: `exi e terra hac' significat separationem a bono illo: `et 
revertere ad terram nativitatis tuae' significat conjunctionem cum Divino bono veri. </p>
