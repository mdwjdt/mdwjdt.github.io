<p><strong>[NCE]799.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_799/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_21-22" target=_top>Genesis 7:21-22</a>. And all flesh creeping on the earth passed away — including the bird and the beast and the wild animal and every crawling thing crawling on the earth — and every human. Everything that had the breath of living spirit in its nostrils, of all that was on dry land, died.<br />All flesh creeping on the earth passed away means that those who belonged to the final generation of the earliest church died out. Including the bird and the beast and the wild animal and every crawling thing crawling on the earth symbolizes their self-deceptions. The bird symbolizes an attachment to falsity, the beast symbolizes corrupt desires, the wild animal symbolizes sensual pleasure, and the crawling thing symbolizes bodily and earthly yearnings. These different impulses are contained within the self-deceptions, and taken together they are called every human. Everything that had the breath of living spirit in its nostrils symbolizes those who were part of the earliest church and had the breath of living spirit in their nostrils — that is, who had lived a life of love and of a faith based on love. Of all that was on dry land symbolizes people who no longer had any of that life. They died means that this life expired. </p>

Verses 21, 22. And all flesh died that creepeth upon the earth, as to fowl, and as to beast, and as to wild animal, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; and every man; all in 
whose nostrils was the breathing of the breath of lives, of all that was in the dry land, died. "All flesh died that creepeth upon the earth" signifies that they who were of the last posterity of the 
Most Ancient Church became extinct; "as to fowl, and as to beast, and as to wild animal, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" signifies their persuasions, wherein the "fowl" signifies 
affections of what is false, "beast" cupidities, "wild animal" pleasures, and "creeping thing" corporeal and earthly things. These in one complex are called "every man." "All in whose nostrils 
was the breathing of the breath of lives" signifies the men who were of the Most Ancient Church in whose nostrils was the "breathing of the breath of lives" that is, in whom was the life of love and 
of the derivative faith; "of all that was in the dry land" signifies those men in whom there was no longer such life; that they "died" signifies that they expired. </p>

Most Ancient Church were annihilated. 'Birds, beasts, wild animals, every creeping thing that creeps over the earth' means their persuasions, among which 'birds' were affections for falsity, 'beasts' 
were evil desires, 'wild animals' pleasures, 'creeping things' bodily and earthly interests. These in their entirety are called 'every man'. 'Everything which had the breath of the spirit of life' in 
its nostrils' means people belonging to the Most Ancient Church, who had 'the breath of the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in their nostrils', that is, the life of love and of faith deriving from love. 'Everything 
that was on the dry land' means those in whom nothing of that kind of life existed any more. 'They died' means that they breathed their last.

Vers. 21, 22.  Et exspiravit omnis caro repens super terra, quoad avem, et quoad bestiam, et quoad feram, et quoad omne reptile reptans super terra; et omnis homo. Omne cui flatus spiritus vitarum in 
naribus ejus, ab omni, quod in arida, mortua sunt. 'Exspiravit omnis caro repens super terra' significat quod exstincti qui ab ultima posteritate Ecclesiae Antiquissimae: 'quoad avem, et quoad bestiam, 
et quoad feram, et quoad omne reptile reptans super terra' significant persuasiones eorum, in quibus 'avis' affectiones falsi, 'bestia' cupiditates, 'fera' voluptates, 'reptile' corporea et terrestria; 
quae in uno complexu vocantur 'omnis homo': 'omne cui flatus spiritus vitarum in naribus ejus' significant illos qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia fuerunt, quibus 'flatus spiritus vitarum in naribus,' 
hoc est, vita amoris et fidei inde, fuerat: 'ab omni, quod in arida' significant eos in quibus nihil talis vitae amplius: quod 'mortua sint' significat exspiravisse. </p>
