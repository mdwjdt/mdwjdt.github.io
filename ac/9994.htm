<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9994节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9994.</strong>“与抹油的无酵薄饼”表外在人里面的属天之物。这从“薄饼”、“无酵”和“油”的含义清楚可知：“薄饼”是指外在人里面的属天之物，如下文所述；“无酵”是指已洁净之物（参看<a href="9992.htm">9992</a>节）；“油”是指爱之良善（<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“抹油的无酵薄饼”表示外在人里面的属天之物，这属天之物是从头两个属天层依次发出的。经上说薄饼要“抹油”，而糕饼要“调油”，是因为薄饼排在第三位，而糕饼排在第二位，如刚才所述（<a href="9993.htm">9993</a>节）。排在第二位的直接从至内层发出，因而拥有“油”所表示的至内在的属天层在里面；排在第三位的间接，也就是说，经由排在第二位的从至内层发出，因而不像排在第二位的那样那么拥有至内层在里面。正因如此，由于糕饼表示排在第二位的属天层，所以经上说它们要“调油”；而薄饼表示排在第三位的属天层，所以经上说它们要“抹油”。不过，这些问题很难理解，除非知道事物是如何按先后次序出现的；这就像目的、原因和结果。至内在之物构成目的，中间之物构成原因，最末之物构成结果。目的必须在原因里面，以便它能成为这个目的的原因，原因必须在结果里面，以便它能成为这个原因的结果。目的不像在原因里面那样显明在结果里面，因为结果离目的，比原因离目的更远。这一切会启示心智认识到至内在之物、中间之物和外在之物按先后次序彼此相随的性质。</p>

And wafers of unleavened things anointed with oil. That this signifies the celestial in the external man, is evident from the signification of "wafers," as being the celestial in the external man (of 
which below); from the signification of "unleavened," as being purified (see above, n. 9992); and from the signification of "oil," as being the good of love (n. 886, 4582, 4638). From this it is evident 
that by "wafers of unleavened things anointed with oil" is signified the celestial in the external man, which proceeds in order from the prior celestials. The wafers are said to be "anointed with 
oil," but the cakes "mixed with oil," for the reason that the wafers are in the third rank, and the cakes in the second (as said just above, n. 9993); and that which is in the second rank proceeds from 
the inmost immediately, and hence has in it the inmost celestial, which is signified by "oil;" and that which is in the third rank proceeds from the inmost mediately, namely, through that which is in 
the second rank, and hence has the inmost not so much in it as that which is in the second rank. Therefore as the cakes signify the celestial of the second rank, they are said to be "mixed" with oil; 
and as the wafers signify the celestial of the third rank, they are said to be "anointed" with oil. But this is difficult of apprehension unless it is known how the case is with the coming forth of 
things in successive order, which is like end, cause, and effect. The inmost is the end, the middle is the cause, and the ultimate is the effect. The end must be in the cause that it may be the cause 
of this end, and the cause must be in the effect that it may be the effect of this cause. The end does not appear in the effect as it does in the cause, because the effect is further from the end than 
is the cause. From this the mind may be enlightened as to how the case is with the inmost, the middle, and the external, in successive order. </p>

'And unleavened wafers anointed with oil' means what is celestial in the external man. This is clear from the meaning of 'wafers' as what is celestial in the external man, dealt with below; from the 
meaning of 'unleavened' as what has been purified, dealt with above in <a href="9992.htm">9992</a>; and from the meaning of 'oil' as the good of love, dealt with in <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'unleavened 
wafers anointed with oil' means what is celestial in the external man, which proceeds in order from the first two. The wafers are said to be 'anointed with oil' but the cakes 'mixed with oil' 
because the wafers are third in order and the cakes second, as stated immediately above in <a href="9993.htm">9993</a>. What is second in order proceeds directly from the inmost and consequently has the inmost celestial 
within it, meant by 'oil'; and what is third in order proceeds indirectly from the inmost, that is to say, through what is second in order, and does not consequently have the inmost within it in quite 
the same way as that second in order. So it is that the cakes, since they mean the celestial that is second in order, are said to be 'mixed with oil', whereas the wafers, since they mean the celestial 
that is third in order, are said to be 'anointed with oil'. But these matters are hardly intelligible to anyone unless he knows something about the way things come into existence in succession; this 
has the same relation as end, cause, and effect. What is inmost constitutes the end, what is in the middle constitutes the cause, and what stands last constitutes the effect. The end must be within the 
cause if this is to be the cause belonging to that end, and the cause must be within the effect if this is to be the effect belonging to that cause. The end is not apparent within the effect as it 
is within the cause, because the effect lies further away from the end than the cause does. All this may enlighten the mind to recognize the nature of the inmost, middle, and external following one another 
in successive order.  </p>

`Et lagana azymorum uncta oleo': quod significet caeleste in externo homine, constat ex significatione `laganorum' quod sint {1} caeleste in externo homine, de qua sequitur, ex significatione `azymi' 
{2} quod sit purificatum, de qua supra n. 9992, et ex significatione `olei' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 886, 4582, 4638; inde patet quod per `lagana azymorum uncta oleo' significetur caeleste in 
externo homine, quod procedit ordine (c)a prioribus.  Lagana dicuntur `uncta oleo,' at placentae `mixtae oleo,' ex causa quia lagana in tertio ordine sunt, et placentae in secundo, ut mox supra n. 9993 
dictum; et quod in secundo ordine est, hoc procedit ab intimo immediate, et inde in se habet caeleste intimum, quod significatur per `oleum'; et {3} quod in tertio ordine est, hoc procedit ab intimo 
mediate, nempe per id quod in secundo ordine est, ac {4} inde non ita in se habet intimum, sicut id quod in secundo ordine est; ideo placentae, quia significant caeleste secundi ordinis, dicuntur `mixtae 
oleo,' et {5} lagana, quia significant caeleste tertii ordinis, dicuntur `uncta oleo.'  Sed haec aegre capi possunt nisi sciatur quomodo se habet cum existentia rerum in ordine successivo, quae 
se habet sicut finis, causa, et effectus; intimum est finis, medium est causa, et ultimum est effectus; finis erit in causa ut sit causa illius finis, et causa erit in effectu ut sit effectus illius 
causae; finis non apparet in effectu sicut in causa, quia effectus longius abest a fine quam causa; ex his illustrari potest mens quomodo (o)res se habet cum intimo, medio, et externo in ordine successivo. @1
