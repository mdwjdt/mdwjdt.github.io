<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7975节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7975.</strong>“又有一大群闲杂人”表非纯正的良善和真理。这从“一大群闲杂人”的含义清楚可知，“一大群闲杂人”是指非纯正的良善和真理；因为当以色列人代表属灵教会（<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>节）所拥有的纯正良善和真理时，与他们同行的“一大群闲杂人”就表示非纯正的真理和良善。因为就那些属于属灵教会的人而言，情况是这样：他们既拥有纯正的良善和真理，也拥有非纯正的良善和真理。因为属灵教会成员没有对良善和真理的觉知，只承认并相信其教会的教义事物所教导的是良善和真理。因此，他拥有大量非纯正的真理，也因此拥有类似性质的良善，因为良善从真理获得其具体品质。属灵人拥有大量非纯正的真理（参看<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>，<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="4788.htm">4788</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>，<a href="6289.htm">6289</a>，<a href="6500.htm">6500</a>，<a href="6639.htm">6639</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="7233.htm">7233</a>节）；因此，他们拥有非纯正的良善（<a href="6427.htm">6427</a>节）。即便如此，主仍将他们保守在尽可能纯正的良善中。祂通过流经其内层的流注做到这一点（<a href="6499.htm">6499</a>节），这时，非纯正的真理和良善从纯正的那里被分离出去，并被抛到周边。这些就是“一大群闲杂人”所表示的事。<br />这“一大群人”以同样的方式表示那些属于教会，但不在教会中的人，如彼此活在顺从和仁爱中的外邦人。他们没有纯正的真理，因为他们没有圣言。启示录中的“一大群人”同样表示这些人，以及非纯正的真理：<br />我听见受印的数目有十四万四千，是从以色列人各支派中受印的；这些事以后，我观看，见有一大群人，没有人能数过来，是从各民族、各支派、各人民、各方言来的，站在宝座和羔羊面前，披着白袍，手拿棕树枝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.4.htm">7:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.9.htm">9</a>）</p>

And a great mixed multitude also. That this signifies goods and truths which are not genuine, is evident from the signification of "a mixed multitude," as being goods and truths not genuine; for when 
by the sons of Israel are represented genuine goods and truths which are of the spiritual church (n. 7957), by "a mixed multitude" accompanying them are signified truths and goods not genuine. For with 
those who are of the spiritual church the case is this. They have genuine goods and truths, and they have goods and truths not genuine; for the man of the spiritual church has no perception of good 
and truth, but acknowledges and believes as good and truth that which the doctrinal things of his church teach. For this reason he is in very many truths not genuine, consequently also in like goods, 
for goods have their quality from truths. That the spiritual are in very many truths not genuine, see n. 2708, 2715, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3240, 3241, 3246, 3833, 4402, 4788, 5113, 6289, 6500, 
6639, 6865, 6945, 7233; and that consequently they have truths not pure (n. 6427). But still they are kept by the Lord in goods in the highest degree genuine, which is effected by means of an influx 
through the interiors (n. 6499), and then the truths and goods not genuine are separated thence and rejected to the sides. These are the things which are signified by "a very great mixed multitude." [2] 
In like manner by this "multitude" are signified they who are of the church, but not within it, as is the case with the Gentiles who live together in obedience and mutual charity and have not genuine 
truths, because they have not the Word. These likewise, and also the truths themselves not genuine, are signified by the "great multitude" in John: </p>
<p>     I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred 
and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel; after these things I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no one could number, out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and 
tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and palms in their hands (Rev. 7:4, 9).  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7975</b></p><p><b>7975.</b>
'And also a large mixed crowd' means [truths and] forms of good that were not genuine. This is clear from the meaning of 'a mixed crowd' as non-genuine forms of good; for when 'the children of Israel' 
represents the genuine forms of good and truths that the spiritual Church possesses, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, 'a mixed crowd' going along with them means truths and forms of good that are not genuine. For the situation 
so far as those belonging to the spiritual Church are concerned is this: They possess forms of good and truths that are genuine, and they possess those that are not genuine. For a member of the spiritual 
Church has no intuitive perception of what is good and true; instead he acknowledges and believes that to be good and true which is taught by the teachings of his Church. This being so, he is in 
possession of a great number of truths that are not genuine, and also as a consequence desires forms of good of a similar nature since forms of good derive their specific quality from truths. For more 
about spiritual people, that a great number of truths in their possession are not genuine, see <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="4788.htm">4788</a>, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>, <a href="7233.htm">7233</a>; and that therefore 
the forms of good with them are not pure, <a href="6427.htm">6427</a>. Even so the Lord maintains in them forms of good which are as genuine as possible. He accomplishes this by flowing in through their interiors, <a href="6499.htm">6499</a>, 
at which point non-genuine truths and forms of good are separated from the genuine and cast to the sides. The latter are what 'an extremely large mixed crowd' means. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such a crowd in a similar 
way means those who belong to the Church, yet are not within it, like gentiles who live in obedience and in charity with one another. They are not in possession of genuine truths either, because they 
do not have the Word. These people too, as well as the non-genuine truths, are meant by 'a large crowd' in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of 
every tribe of Israel. After these things I saw, and behold, a large crowd which no one could number, out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the 
Lamb, wearing white robes, and palm branches in their hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:4,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:4, 9</a>.

`Et etiam turba mixta multa': quod significet bona quae non genuina, constat ex significatione `turbae mixtae' quod sint bona non genuina, nam cum per `filios Israelis' repraesentantur {1}bona et vera 
genuina, quae sunt Ecclesiae spiritualis, n. (x)7957, per `turbam mixtam' comitantem illos significantur vera et bona non genuina; cum illis enim qui ab Ecclesia spirituali ita se habet: sunt bona 
et vera illis genuina et sunt bona et vera non genuina; spiritualis enim Ecclesiae homo nullam habet perceptionem boni et veri, sed pro bono et vero agnoscit et credit quae doctrinalia Ecclesiae suae 
docent; inde est quod in permultis veris non genuinis sit, consequenter etiam in bonis similibus, nam bona suum quale a veris habent; quod spirituales sint in perpluribus veris non genuinis, videatur 
n. 2708, 2715, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3240, 3241, 3246, 3833, 4402, 4788, 5113, 6289, 6500, 6639, 6865, 6945, 7233; quod inde illis {2}bona non pura sint, n. 6427; {3}sed usque tenentur illi a 
Domino in bonis maxime genuinis, quod fit per influxum per interiora, n. 6499, et tunc vera et bona non genuina inde separantur et rejiciuntur ad latera; haec sunt quae significantur per `turbam mixtam 
multam valde.' 	2 (m)Similiter per illam significantur qui ab Ecclesia sunt sed non intra illam, ut gentiles qui in oboedientia et mutua charitate inter se vivunt; illis nec vera genuina sunt quia 
non habent Verbum; hi quoque, {4}ut et ipsa vera non genuina, significantur per `turbam multam' apud Johannem,(n) Audivi numerum obsignatorum, centum quadraginta quattuor milia, obsignati ex omni tribu 
Israelis: post haec vidi, cum ecce turba multa quam numerare nemo poterat, ex omni gente et tribubus et populis et linguis, stantes coram throno, et coram Agno, induti stolas albas, et palmae in manibus 
illorum, Apoc. vii 4, 9. 	@1 vera et bona$ 	@2 vera I$ 	@3 sed qui per regenerationem acceperunt a Domino facultatem recipiendi bonum et verum, a Domino tenentur$ 	@4 tum$ </p>
