<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1010.</strong>“流人里面的人血的”表摧毁仁爱，“人里面”就是与人同在。这从“血”的含义（前面说过，血表仁爱的圣洁）和以下事实清楚可知，即经上采用了“人里面的人血”这样的说法，这是指他的内在生命，这生命并不在他里面，而是与他同在。因为主的生命是仁爱，由于人是污秽不洁的，所以这仁爱并不在他里面，而是与他同在。“流血”就是向仁爱施暴，这从圣言的经文明显可知，如前面所引用的那些（<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="376.htm">376</a>节），那里说明了施加给仁爱的暴行被称为“血”。<br />就字义而言，“流血”就是杀人，但就内义而言，“流血”则是仇恨邻舍，如主在马太福音中所教导的：<br />你们听见有吩咐古人的话，说，不可杀人，又说，凡杀人的，难免受审判。只是我告诉你们：凡无故向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.21.htm">5:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">22</a>）<br />“动怒”表背离仁爱（对此，参看<a href="357.htm">357</a>节），因而表仇恨。凡心怀仇恨者不但没有仁爱，还会对仁爱施暴，即“流血”。实际的谋杀就隐藏在仇恨中，这从以下事实明显看出来：凡心怀仇恨者只想着他所仇恨之人被杀掉，若非被外在约束阻拦，他就会杀之而后快。因此，杀“弟兄”和“流他的血”就是仇恨。既是仇恨，它就存在于对他不利的一切念头中。亵渎也一样。如前面所说，凡亵渎圣言者不但憎恨真理，还会消灭或杀了它。在来生，从那些犯有亵渎罪的人身上明显看出这一点。无论他们在肉身生活时表现得多么正直、明智和虔诚，在来生，他们极端仇恨主，仇恨一切爱之善和信之真。原因在于，这些与他们内在的仇恨、抢劫和奸淫相对立，他们曾用圣洁的面纱掩盖这些邪恶，同时为了自己的利益把爱之善和信之真掺杂进去。<br />“血”表亵渎，这不仅从前面（<a href="374.htm">374</a>节）所引用的经文明显看出来，还可从以下经文明显看出来。摩西五经：<br />凡以色列家中的人，宰公牛或是绵羊羔或是山羊，不拘宰于营内营外，若未曾牵到会幕门口、耶和华的住所前献给耶和华为供物，流血的罪必归到那人身上；他流了血，那人要从他的民中被剪除。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.3.htm">17:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.4.htm">4</a>）<br />在其它地方而不是在会幕旁边的祭坛献祭就代表亵渎，因为献祭是神圣的事，若在营内或营外献祭就是亵渎。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1010.</strong> Shedding the blood of a person in a person means obliterating charity, and in a person means as it exists with us, which the following shows: Blood (discussed earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001" target=_top>1001</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1003" target=_top>1003</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005" target=_top>1005</a>]) symbolizes the holiness of charity. And it says, "the blood of a person in a person," meaning our inner life, which is not in us but exists with us. The Lord's life is charity, which is not in people (since people are unclean and profane) but exists with them.<br />The fact that shedding blood is inflicting violence on charity can be seen from various passages in the Word, and from those quoted above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374" target=_top>374</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_376" target=_top>376</a>, showing that the violence inflicted on charity is called blood.<br />[2] The literal meaning of bloodshed is murder, but the inner meaning is hatred for our neighbor, as the Lord teaches in Matthew:<br />You have heard that among the people of old it was said, "You shall not kill; whoever kills will be subject to judgment." I say to you, though, that any who are angry at their brother or sister without cause will be subject to judgment. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_21-22" target=_top>Matthew 5:21-22</a>)<br />In this passage, being angry symbolizes a departure from neighborly love; see the discussion above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_357" target=_top>357</a>. Consequently it means hatred. Anyone who feels hatred not only lacks charity but also inflicts violence on it, or in other words, sheds blood. Hatred carries murder itself within it, as is clear from this, that those who hate another cherish no greater wish than to kill that person and if external restraints did not interfere would commit the murder. So the murder of a fellow human and the shedding of that person's blood is hatred; and since this is what hatred is, it lurks in every thought we nurture against that person.<br />The same is true with profanation. Anyone who profanes the Word not only hates truth but also blots it out, or kills it, as I said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1008" target=_top>1008</a>]. This can be seen clearly in the next life from those who had committed profanation. No matter how upright, wise, and devout they had appeared outwardly while living in their bodies, in the other world they nurse a deadly hatred for the Lord and for any kind of loving goodness or religious truth. After all, these things combat their deep-seated hatred, their thievery, and their adulteries, which they had veiled in sanctimony and misrepresented to their own advantage.<br />[3] In addition to the passages quoted earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374" target=_top>374</a>, the following passage from Moses shows that profanation is equated with blood:<br />Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or who slaughters one outside the camp and does not bring it to the doorway of the meeting tent to offer it as an offering to Jehovah in front of Jehovah's dwelling place, blood [guilt] will be imputed to that man;{*1} he has shed blood. And that man will be cut off from the midst of his people. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_17_3-4" target=_top>Leviticus 17:3-4</a>)<br />Consecrating something anywhere but on the altar next to the tent represented profanation. Sacrifice was a holy act, but if performed inside or outside the camp, it was profane.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's distinction between gender-specific terms such as "man" and gender-inclusive terms such as "human being," see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>. [Editors]<br />{*2} Distinction is here made between (a) the area within the tabernacle, where sacrifice was appropriate, and (b) the area outside the tabernacle, whether still within the camp or outside it, where sacrifice was profane. A reader of the Latin would be aware that the Latin word prophanus (or profanus), "profane," actually means "before [pro-] the sanctuary [fanum]," that is, not within it. [LHC, SS] </p>

Whoso sheddeth man's blood in man. That this signifies extinguishing charity, and that "in man" is with man, is evident from the signification of "blood"-concerning which above-as being the holy of charity, 
and from its being said "man's blood in man." This means his internal life, which is not in him, but with him; for the life of the Lord is charity, which is not in man, because he is filthy and 
profane, but is with man. That "shedding blood" is inflicting violence on charity, is evident from passages in the Word, as from those adduced before (n. 374, 376), where it was shown that violence 
inflicted upon charity is called "blood." "Shedding blood" is in the literal sense killing, but in the internal sense it is bearing hatred against the neighbor, as the Lord teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Ye 
have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment; but I say unto you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without 
cause shall be in danger of the judgment (Matt. 5:21-22).Here "being angry" signifies receding from charity (on which see n. 357), and consequently hatred.  [2] He who is in hatred, not only has 
no charity, but also inflicts violence on charity, that is, "sheds blood." In hatred lies actual murder, as is manifest from this, that he who is in hatred desires nothing so much as that the one he 
hates should be killed; and if he were not withheld by outward restraints, he would kill him. For this reason the "killing of a brother and the shedding of his blood" is hatred; and since it is hatred, 
there is this in every idea of his against him. It is the same with profanation. He who profanes the Word, as has been said, not only holds truth in hatred, but also extinguishes, or kills it. This 
is manifest from those in the other life who have committed profanation; no matter how upright, wise, and devout they have appeared outwardly during their life in the body, in the other life they hold 
the Lord in deadly hatred, and also all the goods of love and truths of faith, for the reason that these are opposed to their inward hatred, robbery, and adultery, which they have veiled with a show 
of holiness, and while adulterating the goods of love and truths of faith to favor themselves.  [3] That "blood" means profanation, is evident not only from the passages adduced above (n. 374), but also 
from the following in Moses: </p>
<p>     What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp, and hath not brought it 
unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah, blood shall be imputed unto that man, he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off 
from among his people (Lev. 17:3-4). Sacrificing in any other place than on the altar, which was near the tabernacle, represented profanation; for sacrificing was a holy thing, but profane if in the 
camp or outside the camp. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1010</b></p><p><b>1010.</b>
That 'shedding man's blood in man' means destroying charity, and 'in man' means residing with man, is clear from the meaning of 'blood', dealt with already, as the holiness of charity, and from the fact 
that the expression 'man's blood in man' is used, that is, his internal life, which does not reside in him but with him. For the Lord's life is charity, which does not reside within man, since man 
is filthy and unholy, but with him. That 'shedding blood' is doing violence to charity is clear from places in the Word, including those quoted already in <a href="374.htm">374</a> and <a href="376.htm">376</a>, where it has been shown that violence 
done to charity is called 'blood'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the sense of the letter 'shedding blood' is killing, but in the internal sense it is hating the neighbour, as the Lord teaches in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
You 
have heard that it was said to the men of old, You shall not kill, and whoever skills will be liable to judgement. But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without cause will be liable 
to judgement. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'being angry' means departing from charity - about which see what has been said already in <a href="357.htm">357</a> - and consequently hatred. Someone who hates not only has no charity 
but also does violence to it, that is, he 'sheds blood'. It is in hatred that murder lies, as is quite clear from the fact that the one desire of him who hates another is to have him killed. And but 
for the external restraints holding him back he would kill him. This is why killing 'a brother' and 'shedding his blood' is hatred. And being hatred, it is present in every idea he has against him. It 
is similar with profanation. As has been stated, a person who profanes the Word not only hates the truth but also annihilates it or slays it. This is quite clear in the next life from people who have 
been guilty of profanation. Although in outward appearance they have been honest, wise, and devout during their lifetime, in the next life they hold in deadly hatred the Lord, and also all goods that 
stem from love, and all truths of faith, the reason being that these are contrary to all their inner hatred, robbery, and adultery which they have covered over with a display of holiness while adulterating 
those goods and truths to their own advantage.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That profanation is meant by 'blood' is clear from the following in Moses, in addition to the places quoted already in <a href="374.htm">374</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
Anyone from 
the house of Israel who slays an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slays it outside the camp, and does not bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to offer it as a gift to Jehovah before 
the dwelling-place of Jehovah, blood will be imputed to that man; he has shed blood, and that man will be cut off from among his people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2017:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 17:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Sacrificing anywhere else than on the altar 
at the Tent of Meeting represented profanation, for 'offering sacrifice' was holy, but offering it 'in the camp' or 'outside the camp' was unholy. </p>

</p><b>1010.</b>
'Effundere sanguinem hominis in homine': quod significet exstinguere charitatem, et 'in homine' sit apud hominem, constat es significatione 'sanguinis,' de qua prius, quod sit sanctum charitatis, et 
ex eo quod dicatur 'sanguis hominis in homine,' hoc est, interna ejus vita, quae non est in eo sed apud eum; nam vita Domini est charitas, quae non est in homine, quia homo est spurcus et profanus, sed 
apud hominem. Quod 'effundere sanguinem' sit violentiam charitati inferre, constat a locis Verbi, et illis quae prius n. 374 et 376 allata sunt, ubi ostensum quod violentia illata charitati dicatur 
'sanguis.'  [2] Effundere sanguinem in sensu litterae est occidere, sed in sensu interno est odium habere contra proximum, ut Dominus docet apud Matthaeum, 	Audivistis quod veteribus dictum sit, non 
occides, quisquis occiderit, obnoxius erit judicio: Ego vero dico vobis, quod quisquis irascitur fratri suo temere, obnoxius erit judicio, v 21, 22; </p>
<p>'irasci' hic significat recedere a charitate, de 
quo videatur prius n. 357, proinde est odium; qui in odio est, non solum nullam charitatem habet, sed etiam violentiam infert charitati, hoc est, 'effundit sanguinem'; in odio est ipsa occisio hominis, 
quod ex eo manifeste constat quod qui in odio est, nihil plus optet quam ut alter occidatur; et nisi vincula externa impedirent, occideret; quare occisio fratris et effusio sanguinis ejus est odium; 
et cum odium, est tale in unaquavis idea ejus contra eum. Similiter se res habet cum profanatione; qui profanat Verbum, ut dictum, is veritatem non solum odio habet, sed etiam exstinguit seu necat; quod 
manifeste constat ab iis qui profanarunt, in altera vita; utcumque externa forma apparuerunt honesti, sapientes, devoti, cum vixerunt in corpore, in altera vita internecino odio habent Dominum et 
omnia bona amoris et vera fidei, ex causa quia contraria sunt eorum intestinis odiis, rapinis et adulteriis, quae obvelarunt specie sancti, et in sui favorem adulteraverunt.  [3] Quod profanatio sit  
'sanguis,' praeter ab illis locis quae prius n. 374 adducta sunt, etiam ab hoc apud Mosen constat, 	Quisquis e domo Israelis, qui mactaverit bovem, aut agnum, aut capram, in castris, aut qui mactaverit 
extra castra, et ad ostium tentorii conventus non adduxerit illud ad offerendum munus Jehovae coram habitaculo Jehovae, sanguis reputabitur viro isti; sanguinem effudit, et exscindetur vir iste e medio 
populi sui, Lev. xvii 3, 4; </p>
<p>'sacrificare {1} alibi quam super altari quod juxta tentorium' repraesentabat profanationem; nam 'sacrificare' erat sanctum, at 'in castris' et 'extra castra' profanum. 	@1 
sanctificare I.$ </p>
