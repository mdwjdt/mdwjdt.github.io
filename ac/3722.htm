Verses 18, 19. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had placed for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the head of it. And he called the name of 
that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first. "And Jacob rose up early in the morning," signifies a state of enlightenment; "and took the stone" signifies truth; "that he had placed 
for his pillows," signifies with which there was communication with the Divine; "and set it up for a pillar," signifies a holy boundary; "and poured oil upon the head of it," signifies the holy good 
from which it was derived; "and he called the name of that place Bethel," signifies the quality of the state; "but the name of the city was Luz at the first," signifies the quality of the former state. </p>

Verses 18, 19 And in the morning Jacob rose up early, and took the stone which he had placed as his headrest, and placed it as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. And he called the name of that 
place Bethel, though Luz was the name of the city previously. </p>
<p>'In the morning Jacob rose up early' means a state of enlightenment. 'And took the stone' means truth. 'Which he had placed as his headrest' 
means with which communication took place with the Divine. 'And placed it as a pillar' means a holy boundary. 'And poured oil on the top of it' means holy good in which it originated. 'And he called 
the name of that place Bethel' means the nature of the state. 'Though Luz was the name of the city previously' means the nature of the previous state. </p>

Vers. 18, 19.  Et mane surrexit Jacob in matutino, et sumpsit lapidem, quem posuit subcapitalia sua, et posuit illum statuam, et fudit oleum super caput illius. Et vocavit nomen loci illius Bethel; 
et utique Luz nomen urbis priore. `Mane surrexit Jacob in matutino' significat illustrationis statum: `et sumpsit lapidem' significat verum: `quem posuit subcapitalia sua' significat cum quo communicatio 
cum Divino: `et posuit illum statuam' significat sanctum terminum: `et fudit oleum super caput illius' significat sanctum bonum ex quo: `et vocavit nomen loci illius Bethel' significat status 
quale: `et utique Luz nomen urbis priore' significat status prioris quale. </p>
