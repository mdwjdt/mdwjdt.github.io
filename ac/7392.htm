<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7392节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7392.</strong>“叫祂使这青蛙离开我和我的民”表好叫他们不被迫使用由纯粹的虚假所生的推理。这从“离开”和“青蛙”的含义，以及法老和埃及人的代表清楚可知：“离开”是指不被迫，因为祈求的原因是由被迫使用由纯粹的虚假所生的推理而产生的厌倦；“青蛙”是指由纯粹的虚假所生的推理（参看<a href="7351.htm">7351</a>，<a href="7352.htm">7352</a>节）；法老和埃及人是指那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人，如前面频繁所述。<br />至于厌倦，也就是那些进行侵扰的人祈求或谦卑的原因，要知道，这并令他们快乐，因为他们不能通过由纯粹的虚假所生的推理作恶，正直人，此处即他们正在侵扰的那些属于主的属灵教会的人嘲笑纯粹的虚假，这些虚假是真理的对立面。但他们能利用基于用来歪曲真理的幻觉和表象的虚假作恶，这些被歪曲的真理由埃及的诸水所变作的“血”（<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>节）来表示；因为幻觉和表象迷惑人，事实上，它们就像掩盖真理的阴影和面纱。由于他们不能利用由纯粹的虚假，也就是真理完全的对立面所生的推理作恶，所以他们发现这些推理不让人快乐，故请求把它们拿走。因为除了以各种可能的方式作恶外，再没有什么令地狱里的人快乐的了。事实上，作恶是他们生命的真正快乐，当不允许作恶时，他们就陷入厌倦。这就是法老请求除掉青蛙灾殃，而没有请求除掉前面所描述的血灾殃和下面所描述的虱子灾殃的原因。因为“青蛙的灾殃”表示利用由纯粹的虚假所生的推理进行侵扰，然而，他们不能利用这些推理作恶；而“血的灾殃”表示利用由幻觉和表象所生的虚假进行侵扰，这种侵扰令他们快乐，因为他们能利用它作恶。“虱子的灾殃”表示赋予他们快乐的邪恶，因为他们就是邪恶。<br />在来世，所有在世时不因邻舍的缘故而向邻舍行善，不因自己国家的缘故而向自己的国家行善，不因教会的缘故而向教会行善，只为自己的缘故行善的人都以作恶为快乐。因此，他们不为真理和良善的缘故而行真理和良善。他们的快乐在于作恶，这一事实在世上没有显明出来，因为外在人将它隐藏起来。但在来世，当表面事物被拿走，一个人只剩下自己的内在事物时，这种快乐就会暴露并显现出来。正因如此，他们在地狱里，因为凡在地狱里的人都喜欢作恶，而凡在天堂里的人都喜欢行善。</p>

That He remove the frogs from me, and from my people. That this signifies that they might not be driven to reasonings from mere falsities, is evident from the signification of "removing," as being not 
to be driven, for the cause of the supplication was weariness arising from being driven to reason from mere falsities; from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings from mere falsities (see 
n. 7351, 7352); and from the representation of Pharaoh and also of the Egyptians, as being those who are in falsities and infest (of which frequently above).  [2] As regards the weariness which is the 
cause of the supplication or humiliation of those who infest, be it known that this is undelightful to them, for they cannot do mischief by reasonings from mere falsities, because the upright-here 
those who are of the Lord's spiritual church whom they were infesting-laugh at mere falsities, which are negations of truth; but they could do mischief by means of the falsities from the fallacies and 
appearances by which truths are falsified (which falsified truths are signified by the blood into which the waters of Egypt were turned, n. 7317, 7326), because fallacies and appearances seduce, for 
they are like a shade and veil to truths. And because they cannot do mischief by means of reasonings from mere falsities, that is, from utter negations of truth, it is undelightful to them, and therefore 
they deprecate it; for nothing delights the infernals except doing mischief in every possible way; doing mischief being the very delight of their life, insomuch that it is their very life; and therefore 
when they are not allowed to do mischief, they are in weariness. This is the reason why Pharaoh prayed for deliverance from the evil of the frogs, but not from the evil of the blood, of which above; 
nor from the evil of the lice, of which below; for by the evil of the frogs is signified infestation by means of reasonings from mere falsities, by which reasonings they cannot do mischief; whereas 
by the evil of the blood is signified infestation by means of falsities from fallacies and appearances, which infestation is delightful to them, because they can do mischief by its means; and by the 
evil of the lice are signified evils, which are delightful to them because they are evils. [3] In the other life all those perceive delight in doing mischief who in the world do not impart benefits 
to the neighbor for the sake of the neighbor, nor to their country for the sake of their country, nor to the church for the sake of the church, but for the sake of themselves; thus who do not do truth 
and good for the sake of truth and good. That they have delight in doing mischief does not show itself in the world, because the external man hides it; but in the other life when the outward things 
are being taken away and the man is left to his inward things, then this delight comes forth and manifests itself. From this it is that they are in hell, for all who are there love to do mischief, whereas 
all who are in heaven love to impart benefits. </p>

'To remove the frogs from me, and from my people' means in order that they might not be compelled to use reasonings arising from utter falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'removing' as not being 
compelled, for what caused the pleading was weariness resulting from their being compelled to use reasonings arising from utter falsities; from the meaning of 'the frogs' as reasonings arising from 
utter falsities, dealt with in <a href="7351.htm">7351</a>, <a href="7352.htm">7352</a>; and from the representation of Pharaoh, and also of the Egyptians, as those who are steeped in falsities and engage in molestation, dealt with often. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
With regard to that weariness which is the cause of the pleading or self-abasement in those who engage in molestation, it should be recognized that those people find this undelightful; for they are 
unable to do evil by the use of reasonings that arise from utter falsities, since the upright - who at this point are those members of the Lord's spiritual Church whom they were molesting - laugh at 
utter falsities, which are contradictions of the truth. But they were able to do evil through their use of falsities based on illusions and appearances, by which they falsify truths, such truths being 
meant by 'the blood' into which the waters of Egypt were turned, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>; for illusions and appearances mislead people since they cast a sort of shadow or veil over truths. Because they are unable 
to do any evil through their use of reasonings arising from utter falsities, that is, arising from total contradictions of the truth, they have found them to be undelightful and therefore beg to have 
them taken away. For nothing delights those in hell except doing evil, in whatever possible way. Indeed doing evil is the very delight of their life; so great is it that it constitutes their whole life. 
When therefore they are not allowed to do it weariness overtakes them. This is the reason why Pharaoh begged to have the plague of frogs taken away, but not that of blood described above, nor that 
of the lice described below. For 'the plague of frogs' means molestation through the use of reasonings arising from utter falsities, by the use of which however they are unable to do any evil; but 'the 
plague of blood' means molestation by the use of falsities arising from illusions and appearances, a molestation which gives them delight because they are able to do ill by means of it. And 'the plague 
of lice' means evils which give them delight because they are evils.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 A feeling of delight in doing evil exists in the next life with all those who in the world do not do good to their neighbour 
for their neighbour's sake, to their country for their country's sake, or to the Church for the Church's sake, but for their own sake. Consequently they do not do what is true and good for the 
sake of what is true and good. The fact that their delight consists in doing evil is not evident in the world because the external man conceals it. But in the next life, when superficial things are taken 
away and a person is left with what he is inwardly, that delight then emerges and reveals itself. So it is that such people are in hell; for those who are there all love to do evil, whereas those 
in heaven all love to do good. </p>

`Et removeat ranas a me, et a populo meo': quod significet ut non adigerentur ad ratiocinandum ex meris falsis, constat ex significatione `removere' quod sit non adigi, nam causa supplicationis erat 
taedium, ex eo quod adigerentur ad ratiocinandum ex meris falsis; et ex significatione `ranarum' quod sint ratiocinationes ex meris falsis, de qua n. 7351, 7352; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis,' tum 
`Aegyptiorum,' {1} quod sint qui in falsis et infestant, de qua {2}saepius. 	2 Quod taedium attinet propter quod supplicatio seu humiliatio illorum qui (x)infestant, sciendum quod hoc injucundum illis 
{3}sit, nam per ratiocinationes ex meris falsis (t)malefacere non possunt, mera enim falsa, quae sunt negativa veri, rident probi, hic illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali Domini, quos infestabant; at 
per falsa quae ex fallaciis et ex apparentiis, per quas falsificantur vera, quae significata sunt per `sanguinem' in quem aquae in Aegypto versae sunt, n. (m)7317, 7326,(n) malefacere potuerunt, {4}quia 
fallaciae et apparentiae seducunt, sunt enim sicut umbraculum et velamen veris; et quia non malefacere possunt per ratiocinia ex meris falsis, hoc est, ex prorsus negativis veri, injucundum illis 
fuit, et ideo deprecantur; nihil enim infernales delectat quam malum facere, quocumque modo id fieri potest; malefacere enim est ipsum jucundum vitae eorum, usque adeo ut sit ipsa vita eorum; quapropter 
cum malefacere non permittitur, in taedio sunt; haec causa est quod Pharao deprecatus sit malum ranarum, non autem malum sanguinis, de quo {5} supra; nec malum pediculorum, de quo {6} infra; nam per 
malum ranarum significatur infestatio per ratiocinationes ex meris falsis, per quas non malefacere possunt; per malum autem sanguinis significatur infestatio per falsa ex fallaciis et apparentiis, quae 
infestatio illis jucunda est, quia per illam malefacere possunt; et per malum pediculorum significantur mala quae illis jucunda quia mala sunt. 	3 Omnes illi jucundum in malefaciendo in altera vita 
percipiunt qui in mundo non benefaciunt proximo propter proximum, non patriae propter patriam, nec Ecclesiae propter Ecclesiam, sed propter semet; proinde qui non verum et bonum faciunt propter verum 
et bonum; quod illis jucundum sit malefacere, {7}non in mundo elucet, quia {8}externus homo occultat illud; at in altera vita cum externa auferuntur, et homo interioribus suis relinquitur, tunc jucundum 
illud {9} prodit et (d)se manifestat; inde est quod in inferno sint; qui enim ibi sunt omnes amant malefacere, qui autem in caelo sunt omnes amant benefacere. 	@1 i qui hic sunt populus Pharaonis,$ 	@2
