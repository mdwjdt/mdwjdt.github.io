<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1803.</strong>“你两腰所出的”表具有对主之爱和对邻之仁的人。这从“两腰”和“两腰所出”的含义清楚可知，“两腰所出”是指生出，此处是指那些从主生出的人。凡正从主生出，即正被祂重生之人都接受主的生命。如前所述，主的生命就是神性之爱，即对整个人类的爱。这爱具有这样的性质，即祂的意愿是要带来永恒的救赎，若可能，要带来整个救赎，即拯救所有人。凡不拥有主的爱，即不爱邻如己之人，绝不会拥有主的生命，因而绝非从祂而生，也就是说，他们并非“祂两腰所出的”，因而不可能是主国度的后嗣。<br />由此清楚可知，就内义而言，“两腰所出”在此表那些拥有对主之爱和对邻之仁的人。如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华你的救赎主，以色列的圣者如此说，我是耶和华你的神，教训你使你得益处，引导你所当行的路。甚愿你素来听从我的命令，你的平安就如河水，你的公义就如海浪。你的种也必多如海沙，你两腰所出的也必多如沙粒。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.17.htm">48:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“多如海沙的种”表良善，“你两腰所出的也必多如沙粒”表真理。因此，它表示那些拥有爱的人，因为唯独这些人具有对善与真的爱。<br />另外，在圣言中，“腰”表爱或怜悯，因为生殖器官，尤其母亲的子宫代表并因此表示贞洁的婚姻之爱和源于此爱的舔犊之爱。如以赛亚书：<br />你两腰的渴慕和怜悯向我止住了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.15.htm">63:15</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />以法莲是我的爱子吗？是可喜悦的孩子吗？所以我的两腰恋慕他，我必要怜悯他。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.20.htm">31:20</a>）<br />由此清楚可知，爱本身，或主对人类的怜悯本身和同情就是“两腰”和“两腰所出”的内义所表示的。所以，“那些两腰所出的人”表那些拥有爱的人。关于主的国度是指相爱，可参看前文（<a href="548.htm">548</a>，<a href="549.htm">549</a>，<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="693.htm">693</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1803.</strong> But one who will issue from your belly symbolizes those who have love for him and love for their neighbor. This can be seen from the meaning of a belly and issuing from one's belly as being born. Here it refers to those who are born from the Lord.<br />People who are born from the Lord, that is, who are reborn, receive the Lord's life. As I have said, the Lord's life is divine love, or love for the whole human race, and the desire to save the entire race and all its members forever, if possible.{*1} Those who do not possess the Lord's love, that is, who do not love their neighbor as themselves, never possess the Lord's life, so they have never been born from him. They have not "issued from his belly." As a result, they cannot be heirs of his kingdom.<br />[2] This leads to the conclusion that in an inner sense, issuing from his belly here describes people who love him and love their neighbor. In Isaiah, for example:<br />This is what Jehovah your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, has said: "I am Jehovah your God, teaching you to profit, making you go on the path you should walk. If only you had listened to my commandments! And like a river your peace would have been, and your justice like the waves of the sea; and like the sand your seed would have been, and those issuing from your belly like the grains of it." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_48_17-18" target=_top>Isaiah 48:17-18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_48_19" target=_top>19</a>)<br />"Seed like the sand" stands for what is good; "those issuing from their belly like grains of it," for what is true. So it stands for those who love, because [those who are reborn] are the only ones who love what is good and true.<br />[3] In addition, inner organs mentioned in the Word symbolize the love that is mercy. This is because the reproductive organs — particularly a mother's uterus — represent and therefore symbolize the chaste love of marriage, so they stand for love of children.{*2} In Isaiah, for instance:<br />The stirring of your gut and of your compassions toward me have kept on. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_15" target=_top>Isaiah 63:15</a>)<br />In Jeremiah:<br />Is Ephraim not a child precious to me? Was he not the offspring of my pleasures? Therefore my gut has churned for him; I will take utter pity on him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:20</a>)<br />[4] This shows that love itself — or mercy itself — and the Lord's compassion on the human race are what the belly and the act of coming forth from it symbolize on a deeper level. Those who have "issued from the belly," then, symbolize people who love.<br />To see that the Lord's kingdom is mutual love, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_548" target=_top>548</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_549" target=_top>549</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_693" target=_top>693</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_694" target=_top>694</a> above.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For two out of many earlier passages that might be cited on the Lord's desire to save the human race, see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1690:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1735#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1735:2</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} According to Swedenborg, true chastity consists not in abstinence or celibacy but in monogamous marital love. In his 1768 work Marriage Love, he describes marital love as "basic to all heavenly and spiritual loves, and therefore to all earthly loves" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_65" target=_top>Marriage Love 65</a>). He also counts as one of the main reasons for marital love the necessity to bring about the birth of children who will eventually "become angels, serving the Lord to do what is useful in heaven and also to be with people on earth" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1803/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_404" target=_top>Marriage Love 404</a>).

But he that shall go forth out of thy bowels. That this signifies those who are in love to the Lord and in love toward the neighbor, is evident from the signification of "bowels," and of "going forth 
out of the bowels," which is to be born; and here it means those who are being born of the Lord. They who are being born of the Lord, that is, who are being regenerated, receive the Lord's life. The 
Lord's life, as before said, is the Divine love, that is, love toward the whole human race; or His will to eternally save, if possible, the whole of it, or all men. They who have not the Lord's love, 
that is, who do not love the neighbor as themselves, never have the Lord's life, and therefore are never born of Him, that is, have not "come forth out of His bowels;" and therefore they cannot be heirs 
of His kingdom.  [2] From which it is evident that by "to go forth out of the bowels," in the internal sense, are here signified those that are in love to Him and in love toward the neighbor. So in 
Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee in the way that thou shouldest walk. Oh that thou hadst hearkened 
to My commandments, and thy peace had been as a river, and thy righteousness as the billows of the sea, and thy seed had been as the sand, and those who go forth out of thy bowels as the gravel 
thereof (Isa. 48:17-19). The "seed as the sand," denotes good; and "those who go forth out of the bowels as the gravel," truth; thus those who have love, for these alone are in the love of good and truth. 
 [3] Moreover, in the Word "bowels" signify love or mercy for the reason that the bowels of generation, especially the mother's womb, represent and thus signify chaste conjugial love, and the love 
for children that is derived from it. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The stirring of Thy bowels and of Thy compassions toward me have restrained themselves (Isa. 63:15). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Is not Ephraim a 
dear son onto Me? Is he not a child of delights? Therefore My bowels are troubled for him; in mercy I will have mercy upon him (Jer. 31:20). [4] It is evident from this that the Lord's love itself, or 
mercy itself, and compassion toward the human race, are what are signified in the internal sense by "bowels," and by "going forth out of the bowels;" consequently by "them that go forth out of the bowels" 
are signified those who have love. (That the Lord's kingdom is mutual love, may be seen above, n. 548, 549, 684, 693, 694.) </p>

'But he who comes out of your own loins' means those in whom love to Him and love towards the neighbour are present. This is clear from the meaning of 'the loins', and of 'going out of the loins' as 
being born, here those who are being born from the Lord. People who are being born from the Lord, that is, being regenerated by Him, are receiving the Lord's life. As has been stated, the Lord's life 
is Divine love, that is, a love towards the entire human race, which love is such that His will is to bring eternal salvation, if possible, to the whole of it, that is, to all men. People who do not possess 
the Lord's love, that is, who do not love their neighbour as themselves, in no sense possess the Lord's life, and so are not in any sense born from Him, that is, they have not 'come out of His 
loins', and consequently cannot be heirs of His kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From these considerations it is clear that 'going out of the loins' here means in the internal sense people in whom love to the Lord and 
love towards the neighbour are present, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am Jehovah your God, teaching you to profit, making you go in the way you should walk. 
O that you had hearkened to My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea; and your seed would have been like the sand, and those 
who have gone out of your loins like its grains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2048:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 48:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seed like the sand' stands for good, 'those who have gone out of your loins like its grains' for truth. Thus it stands for people in 
whom love is present, for with them alone does a love of good and truth exist. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In addition the loins in the Word also mean love or mercy, the reason being that the generative organs, especially 
the mother's womb, represent and so mean chaste conjugial love and the love of children which is derived from that love, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The yearning of Your loins and of Your compassion<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> towards me 
have held themselves back. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Is not Ephraim a precious son to Me? Is he not a delightful child? Therefore My loins are troubled for him, I will surely have mercy on him. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is clear that love itself, or the Lord's mercy itself and compassion towards the human race, are what the internal sense means by 'the loins', and by 'going out of the 
loins'. Consequently 'those who have gone out of the loins' means people in whom love is present. Concerning the Lord's kingdom as mutual love, see what has appeared already in <a href="548.htm">548</a>, <a href="549.htm">549</a>, <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="693.htm">693</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>

sint illi qui nascuntur a Domino: qui nascuntur a Domino, hoc est, qui regenerantur, Domini vitam accipiunt; Domini vita est, ut dictum, amor Divinus, hoc est, amor erga universum genus humanum, quod 
torum seu quod omnes, si possibile salvare velit in aeternum qui non Domini amorem habent, hoc est, qui non proximum amant sicut se, nusquam habent Domini vitam, ita nusquam ab Ipso nati, seu a visceribus 
Ipsius egressi sunt, quare non possunt esse heredes regni Ipsius; [2] ex quibus constat quod per 'egredi e visceribus' in sensu interno hic significentur illi qui in amore in Ipsum et in amore erga 
proximum sunt; ut apud Esaiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah Redemptor tuus, Sanctus Israelis, Ego Jehovah Deus tuus, docens te ad proficiendum, faciens ire te in via, quam ambules; utinam auscultasses praeceptis 
Meis, et esset sicut fluvius pax tua, et justitia tua sicut fluctus maris; et esset sicut arena semen tuum, et egressi viscerum tuorum sicut scrupi ejus, xlviii 17-19; </p>
<p>'semen sicut arena' pro bono, 
'egressi viscerum sicut scrupi' pro vero; ita pro illis qui in amore, nam ii soli sunt in amore boni et veri.  [3] Praeterea viscera in Verbo etiam significant amorem seu misericordiam, ex causa 
quia viscera generationis, imprimis uterus maternus, repraesentant et sic significant amorem castum conjugialem et inde amorem erga infantes, ut apud Esaiam, 	Commotio viscerum Tuum, et miserationum 
Tuarum erga me se continuerunt, lxiii 15: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Nonne filius pretiosus Mihi Ephraim? nonne natus deliciarum? ...propterea conturbata sunt viscera Mea illi, miserando miserabor illum, xxxi 
20. [4] Inde constat quod ipse amor seu ipsa misericordia ac miseratio Domini erga genus humanum (x)sint, quae in sensu interno per 'viscera, et per egredi e visceribus' significantur, consequenter per 
'egressos visceribus' illi qui in amore sunt: quod regnum Domini sit amor mutuus, videatur prius n. 548, 549, 684, 693, 694. </p>
