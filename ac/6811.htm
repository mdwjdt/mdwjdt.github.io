<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6811节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6811.</strong>至于他们如何急切地搜索并吸收超越身体感官知觉的记忆层面上的那类知识，这已通过以下事实向我清楚说明了：他们在探究我对天上事物所知的东西时，快速地过了一遍，不停地说：“是这样，是这样。”因为当灵人来到一个人那里时，他们会进入他的全部记忆，从中唤起适合他们的一切；事实上，如我经常观察到的，他们翻阅记忆里的内容，就像翻阅一本书。水星灵做起这种事来更熟练、更迅速，因为他们只看真实事物本身，不会关注拖慢、限制，因而延缓内视的那类事物；当一切世俗和肉体事物被视为目的时，也就是说，当人超乎寻常地热爱这些事物，排斥其它一切时，它们就会这样。灵人会将他们的注意力集中在真正重要的事物上，因为没有粘附世俗事物的事物会将心智向上提，从而使它进入一个广阔的领域；而纯物质事物会将心智向下拉，从而使它进入一个狭窄的领域。他们获取知识的渴望也以下面的经历向我清楚显明了：有一次，我正在写关于将要到来的事；这些灵人离得太远，无法在我的记忆中看到它；我不愿当着他们的面大声读这些东西，于是他们极为恼火，并且一反常态，想要责骂我，说我是一个很坏的人等等。为显示他们的愤怒，他们在我脑袋右侧直到耳朵制造了一种伴随疼痛的紧缩。但这样的对待并没有对我造成伤害。然而，这些灵人却因做了坏事，反而离我更远了；不过，他们一直停下来等候，因为他们想知道我对于将到来的事都写了些什么。这就是他们对知识的渴求。</p>

With what eagerness they search out and learn knowledges, such as are in the memory that is raised above the sensuous things of the body, was made evident to me from the fact that when they looked into 
what I knew about heavenly things, they ran over them all, continually saying, "That is so-and-so, that is so-and-so." For when spirits come to a man, they enter into all his memory, and excite from 
it all that is suited to themselves; nay, as I have often observed, they read its contents as from a book. The spirits of Mercury did this with greater skill and quickness, because they looked at the 
real things themselves, and did not delay over such things as are slow, and which confine and consequently retard the internal sight, as do all earthly and bodily things when regarded as an end, that 
is, when loved in an extraordinary degree. For realities to which earthly things do not adhere bear the mind upward, thus into a wide field; whereas merely material things bear the mind downward, thus 
into a narrow one. Their eagerness to acquire knowledges also became evident in the following manner. Once when I was writing something about the future, and they were at a distance, so that they could 
not look at it from my memory, they were very indignant because I would not read it in their presence, and contrary to their usual behavior they desired to upbraid me, calling me the worst of men, 
and so forth; and in order to show their anger they induced a kind of contraction on the right side of my head as far as the ear, that was attended with pain. But such things did me no harm. But as 
the spirits had done evil they went still further off, and yet they waited; because they wanted to know what I had written about the future. Such is their desire for knowledges. </p>

How eagerly they investigate and absorb items of knowledge - the kinds of things on the level of memory above the perceptions of the physical senses - was made clear to me by the fact that when they 
looked at what I knew about heavenly things they ran quickly through it all, saying repeatedly, That is so, that is so. For when spirits come to a person they enter into possession of his entire memory 
and call forth from it the things suited to them; indeed, as I have often observed, they gather those things from it like information from a book. The spirits belonging to Mercury did this very skillfully 
and quickly, for they did not pay attention to the kinds of things that slow one down and that restrict and consequently hamper one's inner vision, as all earthly and bodily interests do when they 
have become one's end in view, that is, when one loves them to the exclusion of all else. The spirits fixed their attention on the things of real importance, for things that have nothing earthly attached 
to them carry the mind upwards and so into a wide field of vision, whereas wholly material things carry it downwards and so into a narrow one. Their eagerness to acquire knowledge was also made 
plain to me by the following experience. I was once writing about things to come. Being a long way off, those spirits could not inspect the things in my memory; and because I did not wish to read those 
things aloud in their presence they were extremely annoyed and wished uncharacteristically to rail against me, saying that I was a very wicked man, and other such things. To show their feeling of 
anger they created in the right side of my head down to my ear a kind of tightening, and pain with it; but such treatment caused me no harm. Yet because they were acting badly they went further and further 
away from me, though they kept on halting, wishing to know what I had written about things to come. Such is their desire for knowledge. </p>

Quam avide inquirunt et hauriunt cognitiones rerum quales sunt memoriae elevatae supra sensualia corporis, constare mihi potuit ex eo quod cum inspicerent in illa quae ego {1}sciebam de caelestibus, 
percurrerent omnia, et continue {2}dicerent quod tale sit, quod tale sit; cum enim spiritus ad hominem veniunt, intrant in omnem ejus memoriam, et excitant inde sibi convenientia, immo, quod saepe animadverti, 
{3}legunt quae ibi sunt quasi e libro; spiritus Mercurii hoc sollertius et celerius faciebant, quia non morati sunt circa talia quae {4} lenta sunt et coarctant et {5}consequenter retardant 
visum internum, ut sunt omnia terrestria et corporea cum pro fine sunt, hoc est, cum unice amantur; sed intuiti sunt ipsas res; {6}res enim quibus non adhaerent terrestria ferunt animum sursum, ita in 
latum campum, mere materialia autem ferunt animum deorsum, ita in angustum.  Aviditas eorum acquirendi sibi cognitiones ex his etiam patuit: quondam cum scriberem aliquid de venturis, et tunc erant 
e longinquo, unde non potuerunt inspicere illa e memoria mea;{7} quia illa non legere vellem in praesentia illorum, valde indignati sunt, et volebant contra morem solitum invehere in me, dicentes quod 
pessimus essem, et similia; utque iracundiam suam indicarent, dextrae parti capitis mei usque ad aurem inducebant speciem contractionis cum dolore; sed talia nihil nocuerunt mihi; {8}at quia malum fecerunt, 
elongabant se adhuc magis, at usque subsistebant, volentes scire {9}quid de futuris scripseram; talis illis est cupido cognitionum. 	@1 scirem$ 	@2 dicebant$ 	@3 After sunt$ 	@4 i respective$ 	@5 
sic$ 	@6 quae ferunt animum extrorsum et sursum quasi in latum quasi in latum campum, non autem sicut mere materialia introrsum et$ 	@7 i et$ 	@8 et$ 	@9 quae de venturis$ </p>
