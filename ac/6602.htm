<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6602节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6602.</strong>思维和情感的气场向周围散发，延伸到距离它们很远的社群所发出的气场，这一点通过以下事实也向我清楚显明了：当我正出于情感思想特别打动远处一个社群的那类事时，其中的人便与我谈论同样的话题，并描述了他们是如何感觉到的。这种情况反复发生。有一个社群在右边相当远的距离处，在胸部较低部位的那个层面；而另一个社群也在右边，但更近一些，就在膝盖那个层面。所感觉到的距离就来源于对真理与良善的情感的状态。一个社群的状态不同于另一个社群的状态到何等程度，这两种社群看上去就彼此分开，距离遥远到何等程度。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6602</b></p><p><b>6602.</b>
That the spheres of the thoughts and affections extend themselves round about into the spheres of societies which are far from the spot, was made evident to me also from the fact that while I was thinking 
from affection about such things as had a certain specific action on a distant society, the people in it spoke with me on the same subject, telling what they felt. This has been done repeatedly. 
One society was at the right, at a considerable distance, in the plane of the lower part of the chest; and another also was at the right, but nearer, in the plane of the knees. Distance is perceived 
from the state of the affection of truth and good. Insofar as the state of one society differs from the state of another, so far the societies appear to be remote from each other. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6602</b></p><p><b>6602.</b>
The spheres emanating from thoughts and affections spread themselves all around into the spheres emanating from the communities which are far away from them, as has also been made evident to me by this: 
When I have been thinking with affection about the kinds of matters that a community afar off was specifically moved by, they have at that time spoken to me about the very matter that was in my mind, 
describing how they felt. This has happened several times. One community was on the right, quite a long way off on a level with the lower part of the chest, while another was also on the right but 
nearer, and on a level with the knees. The distance that is discerned has its origin in the state of affection for truth and good; the extent to which the state of one community is different from the 
state of another is the same as the distance that is seen to set the communities apart from each other. </p>

Quod (x)sphaerae cogitationum et {1}affectionum extendant se circumcirca in sphaeras societatum quae inde dissitae sunt, constare mihi potuit etiam ex eo:  cum cogitavi ex affectione de talibus quae 
in specie movebant societatem e longinquo, quod illi tunc mecum locuti sint de eadem re, dicentes quid sentirent; hoc aliquoties factum est; societas {2}una erat ad dextrum, ad multam satis distantiam, 
in plano partis inferioris thoracis; et alia etiam ad dextrum {3}propius, quae in plano genuum.  Quod appercipiatur distantia, est a statu affectionis veri et boni, quantum status unius societatis 
a statu alterius discrepat, tantum {4}apparent societates remotae ad distantiam. @1 affectionis$ @2 illa$ @3 propinquius$ @4 all singular$ </p>
