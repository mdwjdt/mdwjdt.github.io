<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6481节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6481.</strong>进入来世的灵人带来这样一种观点：圣治或天命以一种总体方式，而非以一种具体方式行动。他们在世时就持守这种观点的原因是，他们看见恶人升职、变富、取得成功，于是便将这一切归因于这些人自己的聪明；殊不知，圣治或天命以人的永恒救恩为目的，因而不以他在世上的洪福为目的；也就是说，不以富贵显赫为目的；而大多数人在肉身生活期间却认为，真正的幸福在于富贵显赫。然而，事实并非如此；因为显赫常常滋生对自我的爱，富贵则常常滋生对世界的爱，从而滋生与对神之爱和对邻之仁相对立的东西。因此，诸如显赫富贵之类的东西既给予恶人，也给予善人，只要这些东西不会对他们造成不利，并且不会把他们引离天堂。<br />更重要的是，主既通过善人，同样也通过恶人实现祂的目的；因为主通过恶人自己的爱驱使他们向邻舍、自己的国家和教会行善。因为恶人渴望显赫，想要得利，并愿意为了这些东西而被视为正直和热心；他们被这种渴望，如同被一团火那样所唤起的做这类事的动力，比正直人的更强劲。恶人也被允许认为一切事都归因于他们自己的聪明，圣治或天命要么不存在，要么仅以一种总体的方式进行运作；因为他们不愿察觉与此不同的任何东西。为叫他们可以做有益于社会的那类事，在一些事上的成功也会照着他们的预计被赋予他们；这些成功比他们将成功归因于自己的事实更能激发他们。</p>

Spirits coming into the other life bring with them the opinion that the Divine Providence is universal, but not in the singulars. The cause of this opinion had been that they had seen the evil exalted 
to honors, and become rich, and crowned with success, which such persons ascribe to their own sagacity; not knowing that the Divine Providence has for its end the eternal salvation of man, thus not 
his good fortune in this world, namely, his opulence and eminence, wherein most persons during the life of the body make happiness itself consist; when yet the fact is not so, for eminence usually begets 
the love of self, and opulence the love of the world, thus what is contrary to love to God and to charity toward the neighbor. Therefore such things are given to the evil, and also to the good if 
they are not unsuitable and do not withdraw them from heaven. Moreover the Lord provides for His ends through the evil equally as through the good; for the Lord moves the evil through their very loves 
to do what is good to the neighbor, to their country, and the church; for the evil desire to be in eminence, they desire their own advantage, and for the sake of these things they desire to seem upright 
and zealous, and from this desire, as from a fire, they are more strongly moved to do such things than are the well-disposed. It is also permitted the evil to believe that all things are of their 
own sagacity, and that there is no Divine Providence, or only one that is universal. As they are not willing to perceive otherwise, and in order that they may perform such things as are conducive to the 
public good, successes are also given them in accordance with their projects, which successes are greater incitements to them from the fact that they ascribe them to themselves. </p>

Spirits entering the next life bring with them the opinion that Divine Providence acts in an overall manner but not in specific ways. The reason they were of this opinion [in the world] was that they 
saw wicked people being promoted to important positions and made rich, and meeting with success, which they attributed to such people's own prudence. Those spirits did not know that Divine Providence 
has as its end in view a person's eternal salvation, thus not his great happiness in the world, not - that is to say - wealthiness and eminence which people during their lifetime think real happiness 
consists in. But such thinking is not correct, for eminence gives rise for the most part to self-love, and wealthiness to love of the world, thus to what are the opposites of love to God and charity 
towards the neighbour. Thus it is that things such as eminence and wealthiness are granted to the wicked, and to the good too provided that those things are not disadvantageous to them and lead them away 
from heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is more, the Lord employs the wicked as much as the good to accomplish His ends; for the Lord spurs the wicked by means of their own actual loves to do good to neighbour, 
country, and Church. For the wicked wish to be eminent, wish to profit, and therefore wish to be seen as upright and zealous; and more forcefully than the upright they are aroused by that desire, as if 
by fire, to perform such deeds. The wicked are also allowed to think that everything can be attributed to their own prudence, and that Divine Providence has no existence or else operates only in an 
overall manner; for they have no wish to perceive anything different from this. And so that they may perform the kinds of deeds that are beneficial to society, successes in the things they think to do 
are granted them, successes which arouse them all the more since they attribute them to themselves. </p>

Spiritus qui in alteram vitam veniunt, secum ferunt opinionem quod Providentia Divina sit universalis non autem in singularibus; causa illius opinionis fuerat quod viderint malos {1}ad honores evehi 
et divites fieri, et illis succedere, quod adscribunt prudentiae propriae; non scientes quod Providentia Divina pro fine habeat salutem hominis aeternam, ita non faustitatem ejus in mundo, nempe opulentiam 
et eminentiam, in quibus plerique dum vivunt in corpore, ipsam felicitatem ponunt; cum tamen non ita est, nam utplurimum eminentia parit amorem sui, et opulentia amorem mundi, ita quae contraria 
sunt amori in Deum et charitati erga proximum; quapropter dantur talia malis, et quoque bonis si non disconveniunt et a caelo abducunt; et praeterea Dominus per malos aeque ac per bonos providet fines 
suos; [2] nam  Dominus malos ad bonum faciendum {2}proximo, patriae, et Ecclesiae, per ipsos suos amores agit; {3}mali enim volunt eminere, volunt lucrari, et volunt ideo videri probi et zelotes, et 
ex cupidine illa, sicut ex igne, ad talia facienda fortius excitantur quam probi.  Malis etiam permittitur credere quod omnia prudentiae propriae sint, et quod Providentia Divina non sit, vel modo sit 
universalis: (m)quia aliud non volunt percipere; utque exsequantur talia quae  conducunt rei publicae, etiam dantur illis secundum cogitata successus, quos {4}quia sibi adscribunt, se excitant magis.(n) @1
