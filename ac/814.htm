<p><strong>[NCE]814.</strong> The Hells (Continued): The Hells of Those Who Spent Their Lives in Hatred, Revenge, and Cruelty<br />THERE are people who nurse a murderous hatred and therefore meditate revenge, seeking nothing short of their victim's death and not resting until they have achieved it. Spirits like this are kept in a deep, cadaverous hell — one that reeks with a stench like that given off by corpses. Strange to say, the people there enjoy the stench so much that they prefer it to the most pleasant smells; such is their horrendous nature and the crazy thinking it spawns. The odor described actually wafts from that hell. When the place yawns open — as it rarely does, and then just briefly — so foul a smell pours out that spirits cannot stay in the vicinity.<br />Some demons, or rather avenging furies, were let out of that hell in order for me to discover what they were like. They infected the air with such poisonous and pestilential fumes that the spirits around me could not remain. At the same time they affected my stomach in such a way that I threw up.<br />[2] They presented themselves in the form of a young child with a tolerably attractive face and a concealed dagger, whom they sent to me with a flask in hand. From this I learned that they had a taste for murder, by either dagger or poison, under the guise of innocence. The bodies of the spirits themselves were naked and quite black.{*1} Soon, though, they were sent back into their cadaverous-smelling hell, and then I was able to watch the path of their descent. They headed to the left, keeping level with my left temple and going quite a distance without moving downward. Later they did descend, traveling first into a fire that appeared, then into a cloud of fiery smoke like that from a furnace, and directly afterward to a point below the furnace and in front, where many dark and gloomy caves led farther down. Along the way, they were constantly devising evil plots and schemes. Their intended victims were primarily the innocent, whom they targeted without cause. While passing through the fire, they wailed loud and long.<br />When released from their hell, they take with them a kind of ring that allows others to identify where they come from and what they are like. The ring is set with spikes which are made of something like bronze and which they grip tightly and twist with their hands — a sign that they are this type of spirit and that they are under restraint.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This detail does not seem to have racial implications. Swedenborg seems to have a positive view of black people in general, and in fact specifically states that "of non-Christians, the Africans are especially valued in heaven. They accept the good and true things of heaven more readily than others do" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_326" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 326</a>). See also note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876" target=_top>876</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg also describes this ring and its spikes in his Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1280" target=_top>1280</a>. There is no indication what part of the body it circles, if any. One possibility is that it may be like a dog collar. [LHC] </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HELLS. HERE, CONCERNING THE HELLS OF THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED THEIR LIFE IN HATREDS, REVENGES, AND CRUELTIES. Such spirits as cherish deadly hatred, and hence breathe out vengeance 
and nothing less than death to another, knowing no rest till then, are kept in the deepest cadaverous hell, where there is a noisome stench as of carcasses; and, wonderful to say, such spirits 
are so delighted with the stench there that they prefer it to the most pleasing odors. Such is their dreadful nature, and their consequent phantasy. A like stench actually exhales from that hell. When 
the hell is opened (which occurs rarely, and then only for a short time), so great a stench pours forth from it that spirits cannot remain in the neighborhood. Certain genii, or rather furies, who 
were sent forth thence in order that I might know their quality, infected the sphere with such poisonous and pestilent breath that the spirits about me could not stay; and at the same time it so affected 
my stomach that I vomited. They manifested themselves under the appearance of a little child, of not uncomely face, with a concealed dagger, whom they sent to me, bearing a cup in his hand. From this 
it was given me to know that they had a mind to murder, either with the dagger or with poison, under a show of innocence. Yet they themselves had naked bodies, and were very black. But presently they 
were sent back into their cadaverous hell, and it was then given me to observe how they sank down. They went on to the left, in the plane of the left temple, and to a great distance, without descending, 
and afterwards sank down; first into what appeared as a fire, then into a fiery smoke as of a furnace, and then under that furnace, toward the front, where were many most gloomy caverns tending 
downward. On the way they were continually revolving and intending evils, and chiefly against the innocent, without cause. When they sank down through the fire they greatly lamented. That they may be 
well distinguished as to whence and what they are, when they are sent out they have a kind of ring to which are affixed points as of brass, which they press with the hands and twist about. This is a 
sign that they are of this nature, and are bound. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 814</b></p><p><b>814.</b>
THE HELLS - continued Here, the hells of people who have gone through life hating, desiring revenge, and being cruel. </p>
<p>The kinds of spirits who harbour deadly hatred and as a consequence breathe revenge, 
breathing nothing less than the murder of another, and are not satisfied until they have done it, are confined in a death-like hell very deep down where the dreadful stench is like that given 
off by dead bodies. And what is remarkable, the spirits there are so delighted with that stench that they prefer it to the most pleasant odours. Such is their dreadful nature and resulting delusions. 
This hell really does discharge such a stench; and when this hell is thrown open, which happens rarely and for only brief spaces of time, the stench welling up out of it is so powerful that spirits cannot 
stay in the vicinity. Certain genii, or rather avenging spirits, were sent from there so that I might know what they were like. They polluted the atmosphere with breath so poisonous and obnoxious 
that the spirits who were around me could not remain, and at the same time it had the effect on my stomach of making me vomit. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 They presented themselves in the form of a small child whose face 
was not unattractive, with a dagger concealed on him, and whom they sent to me carrying a dish in his hand. From this I was given to understand their intention (animus) to commit murder, either by stabbing 
or by poisoning, under a cloak of innocence. But they themselves were naked and had very black bodies. Soon however they were thrown back into their own death-like hell, and I was allowed to witness 
the manner in which they plunged down. They went away to the left on a level with my left temple, for a considerable distance without going downwards, and then they plunged down. First of all they 
went down through what looked like fire, then through fiery smoke like that of a furnace, and immediately afterwards below that furnace into more forward parts where there were many most gloomy caverns 
stretching downwards. On their way down they were all the time turning over in their minds and intending evil deeds, especially - and without cause - against the innocent. When they fell through 
the fire they cried out greatly. So that people may tell where they come from and what they are like, these spirits when sent out hold a kind of ring to which bronze-like spikes are attached. These they 
press with their hands and brandish about, which serves to indicate what they are like and that they are bound. </p>

Continuatio de Infernis Hic de Infernis eorum qui in odiis, vindictis et crudelitate vitam transegerunt </p>
<p>TALES qui odium internecinum habent et inde vindictam spirant, nec spirant nisi necem alterius, 
prius non acquiescendo, tenentur in inferno profundissimo cadaveroso, ubi fetor graveolentus sicut a cadaveribus; et mirum, quod tales ibi fetore isto in tantum delectentur ut praeferant jucundissimis 
odoribus; talis est eorum dira natura, et inde phantasia; ex quo inferno talis fetor actualiter exhalat. Cum aperitur hoc infernum, quod raro fit et modo parumper, inde tantus fetor exundat ut 
spiritus in vicinia nequeant morari: quidam genii, seu potius furiae, inde emissi, ut scirem quales sunt, tali venenoso et pestifero halitu infectabant sphaeram, ut spiritus qui circum me non manere possent, 
et simul habebat effectum in ventriculum ut evomerem. Se manifestabant per {1}infantem non impulchrae faciei, cum latente pugione, quem ad me mittebant ferentem vas in manu; inde dabatur scire 
quod animus iis necandi, vel pugione vel veneno, sub specie innocentiae; at ipsi erant corpore nudo nigerrimo: sed mox rejecti sunt in infernum suum cadaverosum; tunc observare datum, quomodo delapsi. 
  Pergebant ad sinistrum in plano sinistri temporis, et quidem ad multam distantiam absque descensu, et postea delapsi, primum in ignem qui apparuit, tum in fumum igneum sicut fornacis, mox sub ista 
fornace versus interiora, ubi plures cavernae tenebrosissimae, deorsum tendentes; in via continue volvebant et intendebant mala, et quidem praecipue contra innocentes absque causa; cum per ignem lapsi, 
multum lamentati sunt.  Ut dignoscantur unde et quales cum emissi, habent circulum quendam cui affixi aculei quasi aenei, quos premunt manibus et contorquent, quod indicium quod tales sint, et ligati. 	@1
