<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2666节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2666.</strong>“因为从以撒生的，才要称为你的种”表对那些具有良善的人来说，一切救恩皆来自主的神圣人性。这从以撒的代表物和“种”的含义清楚可知：以撒是指神圣理性（如前所示），因而是指神圣人性，因为神圣人性就在理性的至内在部分，而人性就始于这理性的至内在部分（<a href="2106.htm">2106</a>节）；而论及以撒的“种”是指属天的理性，或也可说，那些属天之人（参看<a href="2085.htm">2085</a>，<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>节）。因此，“才要称为你的种”表示他们才是继承人，故救恩是他们的。属灵之人也是“种”，不过是出自“使女的儿子”的“种”，如下一节经文所说的，即“我也必使使女的儿子成为一族，因为他是你的种”。所以，属灵之人只要具有良善，也会拥有救恩，这从这些话的内义明显看出来。主也在很多地方，尤其在约翰福音教导了这一点：<br />凡接待他的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，成为神的儿女。这等人不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从　神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）</p>

In Isaac shall thy seed be called. That this signifies that from the Lord's Divine Human is all salvation for those who are in good, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being the Divine rational 
(as shown before), thus the Divine Human (for the human commences in the inmost of the rational, n. 2106); and from the signification of "seed," which is predicated of Isaac, as being the celestial 
rational, or what is the same, those who are celestial (see n. 2085, 2661). Thus that "thy seed shall be called" signifies that they will be heirs, consequently that they will have salvation. The 
spiritual also are "seed," but from the son of the handmaid, as is said in the following verse: "and also the son of the handmaid, I will make him a nation, because he is thy seed;" and therefore the 
spiritual also have salvation if they are in good, as will appear from the internal sense of these words. The Lord also teaches the same in many places, and plainly in John: </p>
<p>     As many as received 
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, to them that believe in His name who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12-13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2666</b></p><p><b>2666.</b>
'In Isaac will your seed be called' means that from the Lord's Divine Human all salvation is available to those in whom good exists. This is clear from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Divine Rational, 
dealt with already, and so as the Divine Human, since it is in the inmost part of the rational that the human has its beginnings, <a href="2106.htm">2106</a>; and from the meaning of 'seed', used in reference to Isaac, 
as the celestial rational, or what amounts to the same, as those who are celestial, dealt with in <a href="2085.htm">2085</a>, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>. 'Your seed being called' accordingly means that they are heirs, and that salvation as a 
consequence is theirs. Those who are spiritual are also 'the seed', but from the son of the servant-girl, as stated in the next verse, 'And also the son of the servant-girl I will make into a nation, 
because he is your seed'. Consequently salvation is available to the spiritual as well, provided good exists in them, as will be clear from the internal sense of those words. The Lord too teaches the 
same in many places, and explicitly so in John, </p>

Quod `in Jishako vocabitur tibi semen' significet quod a Divino Humano Domini omnis salus illis qui in bono sunt, constat a repraesentatione `Jishaki' quod sit Divinum Rationale, de qua prius, ita Divinum 
Humanum, nam in intimo rationalis incohat humanum, n. 2106; et ex significatione `seminis' {1} quod praedicatur ex Jishako {2} quod sit rationale caeleste, seu quod idem, qui caelestes sunt, de 
qua n. 2085, 2661; ita `vocari tibi semen' significat quod illi heredes, proinde quod illis salus. Spirituales sunt etiam semen, sed ex filio ancillae, ut dicitur in vers. seq. `Et etiam filium ancillae 
in gentem ponam eum, quia semen tuum ille'; quare etiam illis salus, si in bono sunt, ut ab interno sensu illorum verborum constabit; idem etiam docet Dominus multis in locis, et manifeste apud Johannem, 	Quotquot 
Ipsum receperunt, dedit illis potestatem ut filii Dei essent, credentibus in nomen Ipsius, qui non ex sanguinibus, neque e voluntate carnis, neque e voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati 
sunt, i 12, 13. 	@1 hic.$ 	@2 Isaco.$ </p>
