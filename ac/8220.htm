Verses 26-28. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and let the waters return upon the Egyptians, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. And Moses stretched out his hand 
over the sea, and the sea returned, at the turn of the morning, to the strength of its flow; and the Egyptians fled to meet it; and Jehovah shook out the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. And the waters 
returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh that came after them into the sea; there was not left of them even one. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies 
influx; "Stretch out thy hand over the sea," signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine over hell; "and let the waters return upon the Egyptians," signifies that the falsities would flow back to 
them, and would environ those who are in falsities from evil; "upon his chariots and upon his horsemen," signifies doctrinal things of falsity, and reasonings from a perverted understanding; "and Moses 
stretched out his hand over the sea," signifies, as above, the rule of Divine power over hell; "and the sea returned, at the turn of the morning, to the strength of its flow," signifies the flowing 
back to them of the falsities from evil, by reason of the presence of the Lord; "and the Egyptians fled to meet it," signifies that they immersed themselves in the falsities from evil; "and Jehovah 
shook out the Egyptians into the midst of the sea," signifies that thus they cast themselves into hell, where are falsities from evil; "and the waters returned," signifies the return of the falsities 
into them; "and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh," signifies that their own falsities hid them; "that came in after them into the sea," signifies that took possession 
of them; "there was not left of them even one," signifies all and each. </p>

Verses 26-28 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters return onto the Egyptians, onto his chariots, and onto his horsemen. And Moses stretched out his hand over 
the sea, [and the sea returned,] as morning was breaking, to its normal strength<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>; and the Egyptians were fleeing to meet it, and Jehovah overturned<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> the Egyptians into the middle of the sea. And 
the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army, coming after them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means influx. 
'Stretch out your hand over the sea' means the exercising of power by God's truth over hell. 'And let the waters return onto the Egyptians' means that the falsities [arising from evil] would flow back 
onto and surround those steeped in falsities arising from evil. 'Onto his chariots, and onto his horsemen' means the doctrinal teachings that uphold falsity, and the reasonings that belong to a perverted 
understanding. 'And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea' means, as above, the exercising of Divine power over hell. 'And the sea returned, as morning was breaking, to its normal strength' 
means that the falsities arising from evil flowed back onto them, at the presence of the Lord. 'And the Egyptians were fleeing to meet it' means that they plunged themselves into the falsities arising 
from evil. 'And Jehovah overturned the Egyptians into the middle of the sea' means that in so doing they cast themselves into the hell where the falsities arising from evil existed. 'And the waters 
returned' means that the falsities recoiled on them. 'And covered the chariots and the horsemen, and all Pharaoh's army' means that their own falsities hid them. 'Coming after them into the sea' means 
that they took possession of them. 'Not so much as one of them remained' means every single one.

Vers. 26-28.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam super mare, et revertantur aquae super Aegyptios, super currus illius, et super equites illius.  Et extendit Moscheh manum suam super mare, 
[et reversum est mare] ad vergere mane, ad vim fluxus sui, et Aegyptii fugientes obviam ei, et excussit Jehovah Aegyptios in medium mare.  Et reversae sunt aquae, et obtexerunt currus et equites, 
ad omnem exercitum Pharaonis, venientes post illos in mare, non relictus est in illis usque ad unum.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat influxum: `Extende manum tuam super mare' significat dominium 
potentiae veri Divini super infernum: `et revertantur aquae super Aegyptios' significat quod falsa [ex malo] redundarent ad illos, et circumfunderent illos qui in falsis (c)a malo sunt: `super currus 
illius, et super equites illius' significat doctrinalia falsi, ac ratiocinia ex intellectuali perverso: `et extendit Moscheh manum suam super mare' significat, ut supra: dominium potentiae Divinae 
super infernum: `et reversum est mare ad vergere mane, ad vim fluxus sui' significat redundationem falsorum ex malo ad illos, ex praesentia Domini: `et Aegyptii fugientes obviam ei' significat quod 
(x)ipsi se falsis ex malo immergerent: `et excussit Jehovah Aegyptios in medium mare' significat quod sic ipsi conjecerint se in infernum ubi falsa ex malo: `et reversae sunt aquae' significat relapsum 
falsorum in illos: `et obtexerunt currus et equites, et omnem exercitum Pharaonis' significat quod absconderent illos falsa sua: `venientes post illos in mare' significat quod occuparent illos: `non 
relictus est in illis usque ad unum' significat omnes et singulos. </p>
