<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3651节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3651.</strong>谁都能看出，这些话蕴含奥秘，在这些奥秘被揭开之前，没有人知道“在犹太的，应当逃到山上；在房上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳”是什么意思。若没有内义教导这些话所表示并暗含的意思，学习圣言的人和解释圣言的人就有可能被引向并陷入与真理格格不入的观点。此外，发自内心否认圣言神圣性的人因此会得出这样的结论：这些话只不过描述了敌人临近时要躲避、逃跑；所以，除此之外，它们里面再没有更神圣的了。而事实上，主所说的这些话充分描述了教会在爱之良善和信之真理上的荒凉状态。这一点从下文对这些话的解读清楚看出来。</p>

Everyone may see that these words contain arcana, and that unless these arcana are disclosed it is impossible to know what is meant by "them that are in Judea fleeing to the mountains;" by "him that 
is upon the housetop not going down to take anything out of his house;" and by "him that is in the field not returning back to take his garment." Unless the internal sense were to teach what these words 
signify and enfold within them, the investigators and interpreters of the Word might be led away and fall into opinions altogether foreign to the truth; or it might even happen that those who at heart 
deny the holiness of the Word might come to the conclusion that such expressions merely describe flight and escape on the approach of an enemy; consequently that there is nothing more holy contained 
therein; when yet by these words of the Lord there is fully described a state of the devastation of the church in respect to the goods of love and the truths of faith; as may be seen from the following 
explication of the words in question. </p>

Anyone may see that these statements contain arcana and that until those arcana are disclosed no one can possibly know what is meant by those who are in Judea being told to flee into the mountains, what 
is meant by him who is on the roof of the house being forbidden to go down to take anything out of the house, and by him who is in the field being forbidden to turn back to get his clothing. Without 
the internal sense to teach what these things mean and imply, those who study the Word and those who explain it might be drawn towards and slide into opinions that are totally alien to the truth. More 
than this, people who at heart deny the sacredness of the Word may therefore conclude that no more is described by such words than flight and escape from an approaching enemy and that consequently 
nothing more sacred than this lies within them. But in fact these words spoken by the Lord give a full description of that state when the Church has been vastated as regards goods of love and as regards 
truths of faith, as may become clear from the explanation of these words that follows below. </p>

</p><b>3651.</b>
Quisque videre potest quod haec arcana contineant, et quod absque arcanis illis detectis, nusquam sciri possit quid illud, quod `qui in Judaea, fugient in montes'; et `qui super tecto domus, non descendet 
ad tollendum quid e domo'; et `qui in agro, non revertetur retro ad accipiendum vestem suam'; nisi sensus internus doceret quid significent et involvant, indagatores et interpretes Verbi potuissent 
in opiniones prorsus alienas abduci et dilabi; immo quoque illi qui Verbi sanctitatem corde negant, inde deducere quod talibus verbis solummodo fuga et evasio adventante hoste describeretur, proinde 
quod nihil sanctius inibi foret, cum tamen per illa Domini verba plene describitur status vastationis Ecclesiae quoad bona amoris et vera fidei; ut a sequente explicatione eorum verborum constare potest. </p>
