<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10272</strong>.“并香坛”表在源于这些良善和这些真理的敬拜的一切里面。这从“香坛”的含义清楚可知，“香坛”是源于来自主的爱和仁的敬拜的一切的一个代表（参看<a href="10177.htm">10177</a>，<a href="10198.htm">10198</a>节）。之所以说是在不同种类的良善和真理里面，并在服务它们的良善和真理里面，以及在属于敬拜的一切里面的主的一个代表，是因为被代表的良善和真理只有在它们拥有主的神性在里面的情况下才是良善和真理。因为与世人或天使同在的一切良善或真理皆来自主；若没有来自主的生命在它们里面，它们就是死物，甚至是邪恶。因为事物若不是来源于主，而是来源于人，就会关注世人和世界，那些以世人和世界为目的的事物本身就是邪恶。事实上，一个人里面的目的就是核心或至内在的；因为它是他里面的一切的灵魂。由此可见在不同种类的良善和真理里面，并在服务它们之物里面的主的一个代表是什么意思。作为仆人事奉的良善和真理是指在属世人或外在人里面的良善和真理，它们被称为认知和记忆知识。这些由内在人来审视，他从它们当中选择能给予帮助并与其情感的生命，也就是与他的爱相一致的。它们因此是从属的，故被称为“事奉”。还有些良善和真理反过来作为仆人事奉这些；它们被称为感官记忆知识，或源于感官印象的记忆知识。与一个人同在的良善和真理就像家族或家庭，其中有一个家主，儿子、女儿、女婿和儿媳，以及仆人和女佣。在那里占据最低位置的，是那些感官记忆知识，或源于感官印象的记忆知识所描述的事物，尽管如今在大多数人当中，它们占据最高位置。</p>

And the altar of incense. That this signifies in all things of worship from these goods and truths, is evident from the signification of "the altar of incense," as being a representative of all things 
of worship which are from love and charity from the Lord (see n. 10177, 10198). It is called a representative of the Lord in goods and truths, and in ministering goods and truths, and in all things 
of worship, because the goods and truths which are represented are so far goods and truths as there is in them the Divine of the Lord. For all the goods and truths that are with man and angel are from 
the Lord; without life from the Lord in them they are dead things, and even evil; for if they are not from the Lord, but from man, they have regard to man and the world, and those things which have man 
and the world as their end are in themselves evil, for the end is the inmost of man, because it is the soul of all things in him. From this it can be seen what is meant by a representative of the Lord 
in goods and truths, and in their ministering ones. By ministering goods and truths are meant the goods and truths which are in the natural or external man, which are called knowledges and memory-knowledges; 
for it is these into which the internal man looks, and from which he chooses those which act as confirmations, and which are in agreement with the life of his affections, or with his love; 
and because they are thus subordinate, they are called "ministering." There are also goods and truths again ministering to these, which are called sensuous memory-knowledges; for the goods and truths 
with a man are circumstanced like families, or like households, where there are the father of the family, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law, and menservants and maidservants; in the 
lowest place therein are those which are meant by sensuous memory-knowledges, although at the present day with most men these are in the highest place. </p>

'And the altar of incense' means within all things belonging to worship that spring from those forms of good and those truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'the altar of incense' as that which is 
representative of all things belonging to worship that spring from love and charity coming from the Lord, dealt with in <a href="10177.htm">10177</a>, <a href="10198.htm">10198</a>. The words of explanation speak of that which is representative of 
the Lord within the different kinds of good and truth, within those that are of service to them, and within all things belonging to worship, because the kinds of good and truth that are being represented 
are good and true only so far as they have what is Divine and the Lord's within them; for any goodness or truth present with man or angel comes from the Lord. Without life from the Lord within them 
they are things that are dead, indeed evil as well. For if things do not have their origin in the Lord but in man they look to man and the world, and things which have man and the world as their end 
in view are essentially evil. For the end in view within a person is central; it is the soul of everything within him. All this shows what should be understood by that which is representative of the 
Lord within the different kinds of good and truth, and within what is of service to them. By kinds of good and truth which act as servants, forms of good and truth within the natural or external man 
should be understood; and they are called cognitions and known facts. These are surveyed by the internal man, and from them he chooses supportive ones that are in agreement with the life of his affections, 
that is, with his love. And since these are for that reason subordinate they are called those that act as servants. There are also forms of good and truth which act in turn as servants to these; 
they are called known facts derived from sensory impressions. The forms of good and truth present with a person are like families or households, in which there are a householder; sons, daughters, sons-in-law, 
and daughters-in-law; and servants and maids. The lowest position there is occupied by those things which 'known facts derived from sensory impressions' describes, though at the present day 
with most people they occupy the highest position.  </p>

</p><b>10272.</b>
`Et altare suffitus': quod significet in omnibus cultus ex illis bonis et veris, constat ex significatione `altaris suffitus' quod sit repraesentativum omnium cultus quae ex amore et charitate a Domino, 
de qua n. 10,177, 10,198; dicitur repraesentativum Domini in bonis ac veris, inque ministrantibus, ac in omnibus cultus, ex causa quia bona et vera quae repraesentantur, in tantum bona et vera sunt, 
in quantum in illis est Divinum Domini; sunt enim omnia bona et vera quae apud hominem et angelum, a Domino; absque vita a Domino in illis, sunt res mortuae, immo etiam mala, nam si non a Domino sed 
ab homine sunt, spectant hominem et mundum, et quae pro fine habent hominem et mundum, in se mala sunt, finis enim est intimum hominis, nam est anima omnium quae in illo; ex his constare potest quomodo 
intelligendum est repraesentativum Domini in bonis et veris, ac eorum ministrantibus. Per bona et vera ministrantia intelliguntur bona et vera quae in naturali seu externo homine sunt, quae vocantur 
cognitiones et scientifica; nam haec sunt in quae internus homo intuetur, et ex quibus eligit confirmantia, quae conveniunt vitae affectionum seu amori ejus; et quia illa ita subordinata sunt, ideo 
vocantur ministrantia; sunt etiam bona et vera his iterum ministrantia, quae vocantur scientifica sensualia; se habent enim bona et vera apud hominem, sicut familiae aut sicut domus, ubi est paterfamilias, 
{1}et sunt filii, filiae, generi, et nurus, ac famuli et ancillae; in infimo loco ibi sunt quae {2}intelliguntur per scientifica sensualia, tametsi hodie apud plerosque in supremo loco sunt. @1
