<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2010节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2010.</strong>由于“名”表本质属性，以及了解其性质，所以本节经文的含义就显而易见了。也就是说，“你的名不再叫亚伯兰，你的名要叫亚伯拉罕”表示他不再具有以前的品性，而是具有诸如他即将具有的品性。前面说明，亚伯兰事奉别神，并敬拜沙代神（<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>节）；但由于他即将代表主，尤其代表祂的内在人，因而代表其爱的属天那一面，所以他以前的品性必须被抹掉，也就是说，亚伯兰这个名必须改为另外一个名。此名具有这样的性质，即主能以它被代表。因此，字母“H”就从耶和华这个名字中被取出来（在耶和华这个名字中，唯独这个字母包含神性，表示自有，或存在），并被安插到他的名字中。于是，他就叫亚伯拉罕了。稍后会提到，撒莱的情况也是如此，她的名字也加了字母“H”，因此她叫撒拉。由此也清楚可知，就圣言的内义而言，亚伯拉罕代表耶和华或主。<br />然而，要知道，在代表中，代表之人的本性或品性如何无关紧要，因为在这些代表中，要关注的不是去代表的这个人，而是他所代表的事物，这在前面已予以阐述和说明（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>末尾，<a href="1361.htm">1361</a>节）。故就内义而言，这些话的意思是，主要脱去人性，披上神性，这也是承上启下的一个节点。因为现在关于他儿子以撒的应许已立下了，以撒要代表主的神圣理性。</p>

Since therefore the "name" signifies the quality and to know what the quality is, we can see what is signified by the words in this verse, "thy name shall no more be called Abram, and thy name shall 
be Abraham;" to wit, that he was not to be such in quality as in the past, but such as he was about to be. That Abram served other gods, and worshiped the god Shaddai, was shown above (n. 1992); but because 
he was to represent the Lord, and in fact His internal man, and thus the Celestial of His Love, his former quality was to be blotted out, that is, the name "Abram" was to be so changed in character 
that the Lord could be represented by it. Therefore the letter H was taken from the name of Jehovah-which letter is the only one in the name "Jehovah" that involves the Divine, and which signifies 
I AM or BEING (Esse)-and was inserted in his name, and he was called "Abraham." The case is similar with "Sarai," spoken of in what follows; to whose name the same letter was also added, and she was 
called "Sarah." From this also we can see that in the internal sense of the Word Abraham represents Jehovah or the Lord.  [2] Be it known however that in representations it matters not what a man's 
quality is, for in them no attention is paid to the person, but to the thing which he represents (as was said and shown before, n. 665, 1097 at the end, 1361). Therefore in the internal sense the signification 
of these words is that the Lord will put off the human, and will put on the Divine; which also is in a series with what goes before, and likewise with what follows; for a promise is now made 
concerning the son Isaac, by whom was to be represented the Lord's Divine rational. </p>

Now because the word 'names means the essential nature, and also the knowledge of that nature, the meaning of the statement made in this verse becomes clear. That is to say, 'No longer will you be called 
by your name Abram, but your name will be Abraham' means, not what his nature had been previously but what it was going to be. The fact that Abram served other gods and worshipped the god Shaddai 
was shown above in <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>; but because he was to represent the Lord, and in particular His Internal Man, and so the celestial side of His love, his previous nature had to be effaced, that is, the name 
Abram had to be altered to another which was such that the Lord could be represented by means of it. The letter H therefore was taken from the name Jehovah - which letter alone in the name Jehovah entails 
the Divine, and means I AM or TO BE - and was inserted into his name, so that he was called Abraham. The same happened with Sarai further on; the same letter was added to her name, so that she was 
called Sarah. From this it also becomes clear that in the internal sense of the Word Abraham represents Jehovah or the Lord. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be realized however that in representations no significance 
is attached to the nature or character of the one who represents, for in those representations no attention is paid to the person representing but to the thing which he represents, as stated and shown 
already in <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="1097.htm">1097</a> (end), <a href="1361.htm">1361</a>. Therefore the meaning of the words here in the internal sense is that the Lord cast off the human and put on the Divine, which is also the particular point in the 
train of thought both before and after this statement, for the promise is now made concerning Isaac his son, who was to represent the Lord's Divine Rational. </p>

Quia nunc `nomen' significat quale, et nosse qualis est, constare potest quid per verba in hoc versu significatur, nempe, `non vocabitur amplius nomine tuo Abram, et erit nomen tuum Abraham,' [1] scilicet 
quod non esset qualis fuit sed qualis futurus: quod Abram serviverit aliis diis et coluerit deum Shaddai, ostensum est supra n. 1992, sed quia repraesentaret Dominum, et quidem Ipsius Internum 
Hominem, ita {2} caeleste amoris Ipsius, ideo quale ejus prius delendum, hoc est, nomen Abram mutandum in quale aliud per quod potuisset Dominus repraesentari; ideo littera `H' ex nomine Jehovae desumpta 
est, quae littera in nomine Jehovae est unica quae Divinum involvit, et significat SUM seu ESSE, et interjecta est et dictus Abraham; similiter se habet cum `Sarai,' de qua in sequentibus, cujus nomini 
etiam adjecta est eadem littera, et dicta `Sarah': inde quoque constare potest quod `Abraham' in interno sensu Verbi repraesentet Jehovam seu Dominum: [2] sed sciendum quod in repraesentationibus 
nihil faciat qualis homo sit nam in illis nihil reflectitur super personam sed super rem quam repraesentat, ut dictum et ostensum prius n. 665, 1097 fin., 1361; inde nunc significatio illorum verborum 
in sensu interno est quod Dominus exuet humanum et induet Divinum, quod etiam est in serie a praecedentibus, tum etiam in serie sequentium, nam promissio fit nunc de Isaco filio, per (x)quem repraesentaretur 
Rationale (o)Domini Divinum. 	@1 nempe.$ 	@2 i ac.$ </p>
