<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2341节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2341.</strong>“罗得为他们预备筵席”表住在一起。这从“筵席”（feast）的含义清楚可知。筵席在圣言中经常被提及，在内义上表示住在一起。如耶利米书：<br />耶和华的话临到他：你不可进入宴乐（feast）的家，与他们同坐吃喝。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.8.htm">16:8</a>）<br />在这一章，先知被吩咐了很多事，好让他通过这些事表明良善不可与邪恶相联，真理不可与虚假相联的必要性。在其它事中，他被要求“不可进入宴乐（feast）的家”，这表示善与真不可和恶与假同居。<br />以赛亚书：<br />在这山上，万军之耶和华必为万民用肥甘设摆筵席，用陈酒和满髓的肥甘并澄清的酒设摆筵席。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.6.htm">25:6</a>）<br />此处“山”表对主之爱（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。凡具有这爱的，皆与主同居在“筵席”所表示的善与真中，“满髓的肥甘”是指良善（<a href="353.htm">353</a>节）；“陈酒和澄清的酒”是指源于良善的真理（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>节）。<br />在犹太教会，献祭时由祭物制成的筵席无非代表主与人同居在祭祀所表示的爱的圣物中（<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>节）。后来，这事由圣餐来代表，在初期教会，圣餐被称为筵席。<br />创世记21章讲述了亚伯拉罕在以撒断奶那天大摆筵席（21:8），这筵席就代表并由此表示住在一起，以及主的神性与其人之理性的初次结合。就内义而言，“筵席”在其它具有同样的含义，这也可从以下事实推断出来，即筵席是很多聚集的场合，他们全都充满爱与仁，并彼此敞开心扉，一起乐享开心的感觉，也就是爱与仁的情绪。</p>

And he made them a feast. That this signifies a dwelling together, is evident from the signification of a "feast." Feasts are often mentioned in the Word; and in the internal sense they signify a dwelling 
together; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The word of Jehovah to him: Thou shalt not go into the house of a feast, to sit with them, to eat and to drink (Jer. 16:8); </p>
<p>where several things are said to the 
prophet by which he should represent the fact that good should have no communication with evil, nor truth with falsity; and among other things it is said that he should not enter into the house of a feast, 
by which was signified that good and truth should not dwell together with evil and falsity. [2] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In this mountain shall Jehovah Zebaoth make unto all people a feast of fat things, 
a feast of sweet wines, of fat things full of marrow, of wines well refined (Isa. 25:6); </p>
<p>where "mountain" denotes love to the Lord (n. 795, 1430). They who are in this love dwell with the Lord in 
good and truth, which is signified by the "feast." The "fat things full of marrow" are goods (n. 353); the "sweet" and the "refined wines" are the truths thereof (n. 1071). [3] The feasts made from the 
sanctified things in the Jewish Church, when they sacrificed, represented nothing else than the Lord's dwelling with man in the holy things of love signified by the sacrifices (n. 2187). The same was 
afterwards represented by the Holy Supper, which in the Primitive Church was called a Feast.  [4] In the twenty-first chapter of Genesis it is related that Abraham made a great feast on the day that 
Isaac was weaned (verse 8); by which was represented, and thereby signified, the dwelling together and first conjunction of the Lord's Divine with His Human Rational. In the internal sense the same 
is also signified in other places by "feasts," as may also be inferred from the fact that feasts take place in a company of many who are in love and charity together, who mentally conjoin themselves 
together, and share with one another their glad feelings, which are emotions of love and charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2341</b></p><p><b>2341.</b>
'And he made a feast for them' means dwelling together. This is clear from the meaning of 'a feast'. 'Feasts' are mentioned in various places in the Word, and in those places they mean in the internal 
sense dwelling together, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The word of Jehovah came to him, You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2016:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 16: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In that chapter the prophet 
is told many things by which he was to represent the necessity for good to have no connection with evil, nor truth to have any with falsity. Among other things he was required 'not to go into the 
house of feasting', which meant that good and truth were not to dwell together with evil and falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah Zebaoth will make on this mountain a feast of fat things for all peoples, 
a feast of sweet wines, of fat things full of marrow, of wines well-refined. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2025:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 25: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'mountain' stands for love to the Lord, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. People with whom that love exists dwell together 
with the Lord in good and truth, which are meant by 'a feast'. 'Fat things' and those 'furl of marrow' are goods, <a href="353.htm">353</a>, 'sweet and well-refined wines' are truths deriving from goods, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The 
feasts made from the consecrated elements when sacrifices were offered represented in the Jewish Church nothing else than the Lord's dwelling together with man within the holy things of love meant by 
sacrifices, <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>. The same was at a later time meant by the Holy Supper, which the Primitive Church called a feast. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Chapter <a href="21.htm">21</a> below refers to Abraham making a great feast on the day that Isaac 
was weaned, in verse 8. This feast represented and therefore meant the dwelling together and initial conjunction of the Lord's Divine itself with His Human Rational. 'Feasts' have the same meaning 
in the internal sense in other places, as may also be deduced from the fact that feasts are occasions involving a number of people who are all simultaneously filled with love and charity, who are opening 
their minds to one another, and who are enjoying together the glad feelings that are the expressions of love and charity. </p>

`Et fecit eis convivium': quod significet cohabitationem, constat a significatione `convivii': in Verbo memorantur passim `convivia,' et ibi in sensu interno significant cohabitationem; ut apud Jeremiam, 	Verbum 
Jehovae ad illum; domum convivii non intrabis, ad sedendum cum illis, ad comedendum et ad bibendum, xvi 8; </p>
<p>ubi ad prophetam dicuntur plura, per quae repraesentaret quod bonum cum malo, 
et verum cum falso, nullam communicationem haberet, et inter alia, quod `non intraret in domum convivii,' quo significabatur quod bonum et verum non cohabitarent cum malo et falso: [2] apud Esaiam, 	Faciet 
Jehovah Zebaoth omnibus populis in monte hoc convivium pinguium, convivium vinorum suavium, pinguium medullatorum, vinorum defecatorum, xxv 6; </p>
<p>(o)ibi `mons' pro amore in Dominum, n. 795, 1430, 
in quo qui sunt, cohabitant cum Domino in bono et vero, quod significatur per `convivium'; `pinguia et medullata' sunt bona, n. 353, `vina suavia et defecata' sunt vera inde, n. 1071.  [3] Convivia 
ex sanctificatis cum sacrificabant, in Ecclesia Judaica nec aliud repraesentabant quam cohabitationem Domini cum homine, in sanctis amoris significatis per sacrificia, n. 2187; similiter dein per Sacram 
Cenam, quae in Primitiva Ecclesia convivium dicebatur.  [4] In cap. seq. xxi Gen. memoratur quod `Abrahamus fecerit convivium magnum die quo ablactatus est Isacus,' vers. 8; per illud repraesentabatur 
et inde significabatur cohabitatio et prima conjunctio Divini Domini cum Humano Rationali Ipsius.  Idem etiam {1} aliis in locis per `convivia' in sensu interno significatur; quod etiam concludi potest 
inde, quod convivia sint inter plures qui in amore et charitate simul sunt, seque animis conjungunt, et mutuo laetitias quae sunt affectus amoris et charitatis, consociant. 	@1 quoque.$ </p>
