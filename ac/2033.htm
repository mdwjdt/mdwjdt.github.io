<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2033节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2033.</strong>“你务要守我的约”表更紧密的结合。这从“约”的含义清楚可知，“约”是指融合和结合，如前面（17:2，4，7）和第一卷（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>节）所述。此处重复提及、前面频繁提及的“约”表更紧密的结合。就涉及亚伯拉罕的历史意义而言，经上无非是说他要守约；但就以主为主题的内义而言，历史的那一面消失了，论及主的事物取而代之，这些事物涉及更紧密的结合。主的人性本质和祂的神性本质的融合不是在一瞬间完成的，而是经历了祂的整个生命历程，从婴孩直到祂在世生命的结束。因此，照约翰福音中的话说，祂不断升向荣耀，即融合：<br />耶稣说，父啊，荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来：我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>）<br />可参看前文（<a href="1690.htm">1690</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>节）。</p>

Thou shalt keep My covenant. That this signifies still closer union, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being union and conjunction (treated of before, at verses 2, 4, and 7; also 
in Part First, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038). The repeated mention here of "covenant," so frequently mentioned before, denotes a closer union. In the historical sense, which relates to Abraham, nothing else 
can be said than that he is to keep the covenant; but in the internal sense, in which the Lord is treated of, what is historical vanishes, and the things that can be predicated of Him succeed in its 
place, which relate to a closer union. The unition of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence was not effected all at once, but through the whole course of His life, from infancy to the last 
of His life in the world. Thus He ascended continuously to glorification, that is, to union; according to what is said in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Father glorify Thy name; there came a voice from heaven: 
I have both glorified and will glorify it again (John 12:28). (See what was said above, n. 1690, 1864.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2033</b></p><p><b>2033.</b>
'You shall keep My covenant' means an even closer union. This is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as union and conjunction, dealt with already at verses 2, 4, 7, and in Volume One, in <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>. The further reference here to the covenant which has been mentioned so many times already denotes a closer union. In the historical sense which has to do with Abraham, nothing else may be 
said than that he was to keep the covenant; but in the internal sense, in which the Lord is the subject, the historical aspects disappear and things take their place which have to do with being united 
more closely. The union of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence was not accomplished all at once but gradually throughout the whole course of His life from early childhood to the end of 
His life in the world. Thus He was ascending continuously towards glorification, that is, towards union, which is what is stated in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Father, glorify Your name. A voice came from heaven, 
I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:28</a>.

`Tu foedus Meum custodies': quod significet unionem adhuc arctiorem, constat a significatione `foederis' quod sit unio et conjunctio, de qua prius ad vers. 2, 4, 7, et in Parte Prima n. 665, 666, 1023, 
1038; repetitio hic foederis de quo toties prius, denotat unionem arctiorem: in sensu historico qui est de Abrahamo, non aliud praedicari potest quam ut custodiat foedus; in sensu autem interno in 
quo de Domino, evanescit historicum, et succedunt praedicabilia quae sunt uniri arctius.  Unitio Humanae Essentiae Domini cum Divina Ipsius non simul facta est, sed per totum vitae Ipsius cursum ab infantia 
ad {1} ultimum vitae in mundo; ita ascendit continue ad glorificationem, hoc est, unionem, quod est quod apud Johannem dicitur, 	Jesus dixit, Pater glorifica Tuum nomen; exiit vox e caelo: Et 
glorificavi, et rursus glorificabo, xii 28; </p>
<p>videantur quae prius n. 1690, 1864. 	@1 i usque.$ </p>
