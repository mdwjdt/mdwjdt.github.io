<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1679.</strong>“杀败了全地的亚玛力人”表各种虚假。这从“亚玛力”这个民族的代表和含义清楚可知，因为迦南地的所有民族均代表虚假和邪恶，蒙主怜悯，这从下文清楚看出来。“亚玛力人”表虚假，“住在哈洗逊他玛的亚摩利人”则表源于这些虚假的邪恶。“亚玛力人”表攻击真理的虚假，这从涉及它们的那些事可以看出来（参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.13.htm">17:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.16.htm">16</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.29.htm">13:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.20.htm">24:20</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.17.htm">25:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.19.htm">19</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.13.htm">5:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.14.htm">14</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.1.htm">15:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上27.8.htm">27:8</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗83.7.htm">83:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗83.8.htm">8</a>）。<br />5，6节所提及的利乏音人，苏西人，以米人与何利人表源于恶欲，即邪恶的谬念，而此处“住在哈洗逊他玛的亚摩利人”表邪恶所出自的虚假。源于邪恶的虚假是一回事，虚假与源于这虚假的邪恶则是另一回事。虚假要么源于属意愿的恶欲，要么源于属理解力的先入为主的成见。源于属恶欲的虚假是污秽的，不会轻易让自己被根除，因为它们粘附于人的生命本身。人的生命本身就是那渴望之物，即那去爱之物。只要人认定这种生命，即认定这欲望，或爱，加以确认的一切事物就都是虚假，并被植入在他的生命中。这就是洪水前的人。<br />但源于属理解力的先入为主的成见无法以同样的方式植根于人心智的意愿部分。例如，虚假或异端邪说源于意愿的外围，是因为人从小就吸收这类事物，后来成年时又加以确认。然而，由于它们是虚假的，所以它们只会制造生活的邪恶。如，若人相信他因行为配得救赎，并确认这种信念，那么功德感、他自己的公义和得救的保证就是由它产生的邪恶。另一方面，人若认为不将功德置于行为中就不可能有虔诚的生命，那么由此而来的邪恶就是，他毁灭了自己里面生命的一切虔诚，并屈服于恶欲和欢娱。这样的例子还有很多。这就是本节所论述的虚假和源于它们的恶欲。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1679.</strong> And struck every field of the Amalekites symbolizes general categories of falsity, as can be seen from the representation and symbolism of the Amalekite nation. All the nations that lived in the land of Canaan represented categories of falsity and evil, as the following will establish, by the Lord's divine mercy. The Amalekites symbolized falsity and the Amorites in Hazazon-tamar symbolized the evil that springs from falsity. The fact that the Amalekites symbolized falsity that combats truth can be seen from mention made of them in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_exodus_17_13-16" target=_top>Exodus 17:13-16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_29" target=_top>Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_20" target=_top>24:20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_25_17" target=_top>Deuteronomy 25:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_25_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_25_19" target=_top>19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_judges_5_13-14" target=_top>Judges 5:13-14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_15_1-35" target=_top>1 Samuel 15:1-35</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_27_8" target=_top>27:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_psalms_83_7-8" target=_top>Psalms 83:7-8</a>.<br />[2] The Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim, and Horites mentioned in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1679/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_5-6" target=_top>5-6</a> symbolized persuasive lies rising out of evil cravings, or in other words, out of evil. In the present verse, though, the Amalekites and the Amorite in Hazazon-tamar symbolize falsity that results in evil. Falsity that springs from evil is one thing; falsity and the evil that springs from it is not the same. Falsity bubbles up either from cravings, which belong to the will, or from the assumptions we make, which belong to the intellect.<br />Falsity that results from cravings in the will is vile and does not easily allow itself to be uprooted, since it clings to our actual life. What we crave, that is, what we love, is our actual life. When we justify this life 钬?this appetite, this love 钬?in ourselves, all our justifications are falsities, and they are grafted onto our life. That is what happened with the people who lived just before the Flood.<br />[3] However, falsity developing from our assumptions, which belong to the intellect, cannot take very deep root in our volitional side. An example is false or heretical doctrines, which originate outside our will; we are indoctrinated in them from childhood on and later confirm them for ourselves as adults. As they are false, however, they cannot help producing bad effects in our lives. For instance, when people believe they earn salvation by doing good deeds and confirm themselves in this idea, the resulting evil is the sense of merit itself, along with self-righteousness and smugness. On the other hand, when people believe it is absolutely out of the question for their lives to be godly if they do not place merit in good works, the resulting evil is that they surrender to desire and pleasure and wipe out any trace of a godly life in themselves. It is similar in many other areas.<br />These are the types of falsity and resulting evil that form the theme of the present verse. </p>

And smote all the field of the Amalekites. That this signifies the kinds of falsities, is evident from the representation and signification of the Amalekite nation. By all the nations that were in the 
land of Canaan there were represented different kinds of evils and falsities, as will be evident, of the Lord's Divine mercy, from what follows. Falsities were signified by "the Amalekites," and evils 
derived from the falsities, by "the Amorites in Hazezon-tamar." That falsities by which truths are attacked are signified by the Amalekites, may be seen from the things that are related concerning 
them (see Exod. 17:13-16; Num. 13:29; 24:20; Deut. 25:17-19; Judges 5:13-14; 1 Sam. 15:1-35; 27:8; Ps. 83:7-8).  [2] By the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim, and Horites, spoken of in verses 5 and 6, were signified 
the persuasions of falsity that arise from cupidities of evil, that is, from evils; but by the Amalekites and the Amorite in Hazezon-tamar, are signified the falsities from which come evils. Falsity 
from evil is one thing, and falsity and the evil derived from it is another. Falsities spring either from cupidities, which are of the will, or from received principles, which are of the understanding. 
Falsities that are from the cupidities of the will are foul, nor do they suffer themselves, like others, to be easily rooted out, for they cohere with the man's very life. The very life of man is 
that which desires, that is, loves. While a man is confirming in himself this life, or cupidity, or love, all the things which confirm are falsities, and are implanted in his life. Such were the antediluvians. 
 [3] But the falsities from received principles, which are of the understanding, cannot be thus rooted in the will part of man. False or heretical doctrines, for instance, have their origin 
outside of the will, from the man's being imbued with such things from infancy, and afterwards from confirmation in adult age. But as they are false, they cannot but produce evils of life; as for instance 
in the case of a man who believes in meriting salvation by works, and confirms himself in this belief,-the merit itself, self-justification, and confidence, are the evils that come from it; or 
on the other hand one who believes that it is impossible to have piety of life without placing merit in works,-the evil from this is that he extinguishes in himself all piety of life, and gives himself 
up to cupidities and pleasures. So in many other cases. Such are the falsities and the evils derived from them that are treated of in this verse. </p>

'And they smote all the territory of the Amalekites' means kinds of falsities. This is clear from the representation and meaning of the 'Amalekite' nation, for all the nations that were in the land of 
Canaan represented kinds of falsities and evils, as will be clear, in the Lord's Divine mercy, from what follows. 'The Amalekites' means falsities, 'the Amorites in Hazezon-tamar' evils deriving from 
falsities. That 'the Amalekites' means falsities which assail truths becomes clear from what is mentioned regarding the Amalekites in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2017:13-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 17:13-end</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:29;%2024:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:29; 24:20</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2025:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 25:17-19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:14;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:14; 1</a>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim, and Horites, referred to in verses 5, 6, mean false persuasions that have their origins in desires for evil, that is, in evils, whereas 
here 'the Amalekites and the Amorites in Hazezon-tamar' means falsities from which evils derive. Falsity deriving from evil is one thing, falsity and evil deriving from that falsity another. Falsities 
spring either from evil desires which belong to the will or from accepted ideas which belong to the understanding. Falsities that spring from evil desires belonging to the will are foul and do not 
easily allow themselves to be rooted out, for they cling to a person's life itself. A person's life itself is that which desires, that is, which loves. As long as he is making that life firm within 
himself, that is, confirming that desire or love, all things of a confirmatory nature are false and are implanted in his life. Such were the people before the Flood. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Falsities however which spring 
from accepted ideas belonging to the understanding cannot be rooted in the same way in the will part of man's mind. Like false or heretical doctrines, these have their origin outside of the will, 
coming instead from the absorption of such matters in early childhood, and after that from the confirmation of them in adult years Yet because they are false they inevitably produce evils of life. For 
example, when anyone believes that he merits salvation through works and confirms himself in that belief, a sense of merit, of his own righteousness, and of assurance [of salvation] are the evils that 
result from it. On the other hand, when anyone believes that a truly devout life is not possible unless merit is attached to works, the evil which results from that belief is that he destroys all such 
devoutness in himself and gives himself up to evil desires and pleasures It is the same with many other examples that could be taken. Such are the falsities and derivative evils dealt with in this verse. </p>

'Et percusserunt omnem agrum Amalekitarum': quod significet genera falsorum, constat a repraesentatione et significatione gentis 'Amalekitae'; per omnes gentes quae fuerunt in terra Canaane repraesentata 
sunt genera falsorum et malorum, ut ex sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, constabit; per 'Amalekitas' significata sunt falsa, per 'Emoraeos in Hazezon-tamar' mala ex falsis; quod per 'Amalekitas' 
falsa quibus oppugnantur vera, constare potest ab illis quae de Amalekitis memorantur Exod. xvii 13 ad fin.; Num. xiii 29; xxiv 20; Deut. xxv 17-19; Jud. v 13, 14; 1 Sam. xv 1 ad fin.; xxvii 
8; Ps. lxxxiii 8, 9 [A.V. 7, 8].  [2] Per 'Rephaim, Zuzimos, Emim, Horitas,' de quibus in vers. 5, 6, significatae sunt persuasiones falsi, oriundae ex cupiditatibus mali, hoc est, ex malis; hic autem 
per 'Amalekitas et Emoraeum in Hazezon-tamar' significantur falsa ex quibus mala; aliud est falsum ex malo, et aliud falsum et inde malum; falsa scaturiunt vel ex cupiditatibus quae sunt voluntatis, 
vel ex principiis captis quae sunt intellectus; falsa ex cupiditatibus quae sunt voluntatis, sunt foeda, nec ita exstirpari se patiuntur, quia ipsi vitae hominis cohaerent; ipsa vita hominis est quod 
cupit, hoc est, quod amat; dum confirmat apud se hanc vitam, seu cupiditatem aut amorem, omnia confirmantia sunt falsa et implantantur ejus vitae; tales fuerunt antediluviani: [3] falsa autem ex principiis 
captis quae sunt intellectus, non ita radicari possunt in parte voluntaria hominis; sicut sunt doctrinalia falsa aut haeretica; haec ab origine extra voluntatem incohant, et ab imbuitione talium 
ab infantia, et dein a confirmatione in aetate adulta; at quia falsa sunt non possunt aliter quam producere mala vitae; ut qui credit mereri salutem per opera et se confirmat in eo, ipsum meritum, 
justificatio sui, et confidentia, sunt mala quae inde; et vicissim, qui credit pietate vitae non dari posse nisi meritum ponatur in operibus, malum inde est quod exstinguat apud se omnem pietatem vitae, 
et se dedat cupiditatibus et voluptatibus; similiter in aliis multis: talia falsa inde mala sunt, de quibus in hoc versu agitur. </p>
