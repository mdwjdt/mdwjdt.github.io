<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5293节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5293.</strong>“叫他们把一切的粮食聚敛起来”表一切有用的事物。这从“聚敛”和“粮食”的含义清楚可知：“聚敛”是指集中起来保存；“粮食”是指有用的事物。就内义而言，严格来说，“粮食”表示滋养人灵魂，也就是滋养死后之人的事物，因为那时他作为一个灵魂或灵活着，不再像世上那样需要物质食物，而是需要属灵的食物；而属灵食物就在于一切有用的事物，以及一切有助于功用的事物。有助于功用的，就是认识何为良善与真理；有用的是意愿并行出良善与真理。这些就是滋养天使的事物，因而被称为属灵和属天的食物。人的意愿和理解力，即他的意图或目的住在他的心智里面；即便他活在肉身期间，他的心智也不是用任何其它食物来滋养的。物质食物并没有深入到心智，只深入到身体的各个部分；整个身体靠物质食物来维持，目的是为了当身体享受自己的食物时，这心智也能享受它的食物，也就是说，目的是为了能有一个在健康身体中的健康心智。<br />“食物”在灵义上表示一切有用的事物，这是因为人的全部知识、全部理解和智慧，因而全部意愿必须有功用为它们的目的。因此，其生命的品质就取决于其功用的品质。“食物”在内义上表示一切有用的事物，这一真理从主的这些话明显看出来：<br />耶稣对门徒说，我有食物吃，是你们不知道的。门徒就彼此说，莫非有人拿什么给祂吃吗？耶稣对他们说，我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意，完成祂的工。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.32.htm">4:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.34.htm">34</a>）<br /><br />不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永生的食物劳力，就是人子要赐给你们的，因为人子是父神所印证的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.27.htm">6:27</a>）</p>

And let them gather all the food. That this signifies all things that are of use, is evident from the signification of "gathering," as being to bring together and preserve; and from the signification 
of "food," as being things that are of use. In the internal sense "food" properly signifies the things that nourish the soul of man, that is, that nourish him after death, for he then lives as a soul 
or spirit, and no longer needs material food, but spiritual food, which consists in everything that is of use, and everything that is conducive to use. That which is conducive to use is to know what 
is good and true; that which is of use is to will and do what is good and true. These are the things that nourish the angels, and are therefore called spiritual and heavenly food. Man's mind within which 
are his interior understanding and interior will, or his intentions or ends, is not nourished by any other food even while he lives in the body. Material food does not penetrate to the mind, but only 
to the things of the body, which that food sustains to the end that this mind may enjoy its food while the body enjoys its food, that is, that this mind may be sound in a sound body. [2] That "food" 
in the spiritual sense denotes everything that is of use, is because all man's knowing, and all his understanding and being wise, and therefore all his willing, ought to have use for their end; hence 
the quality of his life is according to the quality of his use. That "food" in the internal sense denotes everything that is of use, is plain from these words of the Lord: </p>
<p>	Jesus said to the disciples, 
I have food to eat that ye know not of. Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought Him aught to eat? Jesus saith unto them, My food is to do the will of Him that sent Me, 
and to perfect His work (John 4:32-34); and in another place: </p>
<p>	Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for that food that remaineth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you; for 
Him hath God the Father sealed (John 6:27). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5293</b></p><p><b>5293.</b>
'And let them gather all the food' means all things that have a useful purpose. This is clear from the meaning of 'gathering' as drawing together and preserving; and from the meaning of 'food' as things 
which have a useful purpose. In the internal sense 'food' means, strictly speaking, those things which nourish a person's soul, that is, which nourish him when his bodily life is ended. For when this 
is ended his soul or spirit is living, and he no longer needs material food as he did in the world; but he does need spiritual food, which consists in everything that has a useful purpose and everything 
leading to this. That which leads to what has a useful purpose is knowing what goodness and truth are; and that which has such a purpose is the desire to realize these in actions. These are the 
things with which angels are nourished and which are therefore called spiritual and celestial foods. A person's mind - the place within him where his will and understanding, that is, his intentions or 
ends in view, reside - is nourished by no other kind of food, even while he lives in the body. Material food does not extend as far as that; it extends only to his bodily parts, which are sustained 
by that material food to the end that the mind may be sustained by food for the mind while the body is sustained by food for the body, that is, to the end that there may be a healthy mind in a healthy 
body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason 'food' in the spiritual sense means everything that has a useful purpose is that a person's entire knowledge, his entire understanding and wisdom, and so his entire will must 
have a useful purpose as its end in view. Consequently as is the nature of the purpose he has in view, so is the nature of his life. The truth that 'food' in the spiritual sense means everything with 
a useful purpose is evident from the following words spoken by the Lord, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the disciples, I have food to eat of which you do not know. The disciples said to one another, Has anyone brought 
Him anything to eat? Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%204:32-34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 4:32-34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not labour for the food which perishes, but 
for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On Him the Father - God - has set His seal. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:27</a>.

`Et {1}congregent' omnem cibum': quod significet omnia quae usus, constat ex significatione `congregare' quod sit conferre et conservare; et ex significatione `cibi' quod sint illa quae usus; cibus 
in sensu interno proprie significat illa quae nutriunt animam hominis, hoc est, quae nutriunt illum post vitam {2}corporis, nam (t)is tunc vivit anima seu spiritus, et non amplius opus habet cibo materiali 
sicut in mundo, sed cibo spirituali, qui cibus est omne id quod est usus et omne id quod conducit ad usum; quod conducit ad usum, est scire quid bonum et verum; {3} quod est usus, est velle et facere 
illa; haec sunt quibus nutriuntur angeli, et quae ideo dicuntur cibi spirituales et caelestes; mens hominis, ubi ejus interior intellectus et interior voluntas, seu ubi {4}intentiones aut fines, 
nec nutritur alio cibo, etiam cum vivit in corpore; cibus materialis non illuc penetrat sed solum ad illa quae corporis sunt, quae cibus ille sustentat ob finem ut mens illa {5}suo cibo frui queat cum 
corpus suo, hoc est, ut mens illa sana sit in corpore sano; [2] quod cibus in spirituali sensu sit omne quod usus, est quia omne scire hominis, ac omne ejus intelligere ac sapere, et sic omne ejus velle, 
pro fine habebit usum, inde secundum quale usus est quale vitae ejus. Quod cibus in sensu interno sit omne quod est usus, patet ab his Domini verbis,  Jesus dixit discipulis, Ego cibum habeo quem 
edam, quem vos nescitis: dicebant {6} discipuli ad se invicem, Num quis attulit Ipsi quod comederet? dicit illis Jesus, Cibus Meus est ut faciam voluntatem Ipsius Qui misit Me, et perficiam Ipsius 
opus, Joh. iv 32-34:   et alibi,   Operamini cibum (x)non qui perit, sed cibum qui manet in vitam aeternam, quem Filius hominis vobis dabit, hunc Pater obsignavit Deus, Joh. vi 27.    @1 congregavit
