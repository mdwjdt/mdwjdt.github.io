<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10631</strong>.出埃及记34:10， 11.耶和华说，看哪，我要立一个约。我要在你众百姓面前行奇事，是在全地列族中所未曾创造的；有你在他们中间的众百姓都要看见耶和华的作为，因这是我向你所行的一件奇事。我今天所吩咐你的，你要谨守。看哪，我要从你面前撵出亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人。<br />“耶和华说，看哪，我要立一个约”表首要事物，主藉圣言与人类的结合通过这些事物实现。“我要在你众百姓面前行奇事”表一部圣言，为教会提供，神性在其中每一个部分里面。“是在全地列族中所未曾创造的”表这样一部圣言从来没有出现在世界上，无论有教会的地方还是没有教会的地方。“有你在他们中间的众百姓都要看见耶和华的作为”表凡接受圣言的人都会承认它里面的神性。“因这是我向你所行的一件奇事”表圣言在每一个部分中的本质。“我今天所吩咐你的，你要谨守”表如果他们执行永恒真理所规定的这些首要的事。“看哪，我要从你面前撵出亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人”表那么就移开邪恶和由它们所产生的虚假。</p>

Verses 10, 11. And He said, Behold I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do wonderful things, such as have not been created in all the earth, and in all nations; and all the people in the midst 
of whom thou art shall see the work of Jehovah, because this is a wonderful thing that I do with thee. Keep thou that which I command thee this day; behold I drive out from thy faces the Amorite, 
and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. "And He said, Behold I make a covenant," signifies the primary things whereby there is the conjunction of the 
Lord with the human race by means of the Word; "before all thy people I will do wonderful things," signifies the Word, in that it is Divine in each and all things for the sake of the church; "such as 
have not been created in all the earth, and in all nations," signifies that there never was such a Divine in the world where the church is, and where the church is not; "and all the people in the midst 
of whom thou art shall see the work of Jehovah," signifies that all by whom the Word is received will acknowledge the Divine therein; "because this is a wonderful thing that I do with thee," signifies 
the quality of the Word in each and all things; "keep thou that which I command thee this day," signifies if they do these primary things which are of the eternal truth; "behold, I drive out from thy 
faces the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite," signifies the removal then of evils and of the falsities thence derived. </p>

Verses 10,11  And He said, Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels which have not been created in all the earth nor in all nations; and all the people in whose midst 
you are will see the work of Jehovah, because this is a marvel which I am doing with you. Observe that which I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out from [before] your face the Amorite, and the 
Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. </p>
<p>'And He said, Behold, I am making a covenant' means the chief things through which the joining of the Lord to the 
human race by means of the Word is brought about. 'Before all your people I will do marvels' means a Word, Divine in every single part, provided for the Church. 'Which have not been created in all the 
earth nor in all nations' means that never before has a Divine Word such as this been present in the world, either where the Church exists or where it does not exist. 'And all the people in whose midst 
you are will see the work of Jehovah' means that all who accept the Word will acknowledge the Divine within it. 'Because this is a marvel which I am doing with you' means the essential nature of the 
Word in every single part. 'Observe that which I command you this day' means, if they carry out those chief things laid down by eternal truth. 'Behold, I am driving out from [before] your face the 
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite' means the moving away then of evils and the falsities arising from them.  </p>

Vers. 10, 11.  Et dixit, Ecce Ego pangens foedus, coram omni populo tuo faciam mirabilia, quae non creata sunt in omni terra, et in omnibus gentibus, et videbit omnis populus, cujus tu in medio ejus, 
opus Jehovae, quod mirabile hoc quod Ego faciens cum te.  Custodi tibi id quod Ego praecipio tibi hodie; ecce Ego expellens a faciebus tuis Emoritam, et Canaanitam, et Chittitam, et Perisitam, et Chivitam, 
et Jebusitam.  `Et dixit, Ecce Ego pangens foedus' significat primaria per quae conjunctio Domini cum humano genere per Verbum:  `coram omni populo tuo faciam mirabilia' significat Verbum quod 
Divinum in omnibus et singulis pro Ecclesia:  `quae non creata sunt in omni terra, et in omnibus gentibus' significat quod tale Divinum nusquam fuerit in mundo ubi Ecclesia et non Ecclesia:  `et videbit 
omnis populus, cujus tu in medio ejus, opus Jehovae' significat quod omnes a quibus Verbum recipitur agnoscent Divinum in eo:  `quod mirabile hoc quod Ego faciens cum te' significat quale Verbi in 
omnibus et singulis:  `custodi tibi quod Ego praecipio tibi hodie' significat si faciant primaria haec quae sunt aeternae veritatis:  `ecce Ego expellens a faciebus tuis Emoritam, et Canaanitam, et Chittitam, 
et Perisitam, et Chivitam, et Jebusitam' significat remotionem tunc malorum et inde falsorum. </p>
