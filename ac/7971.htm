Verses 37-39. And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides babe. And a great mixed multitude also went up with them; and flock, 
and herd, a very great acquisition. And they baked the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it had not been leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt, and could 
not tarry, and moreover, they had not prepared for themselves any provision for the journey. "And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth," signifies the first state of departure and its 
quality; "about six hundred thousand on foot that were men," signifies all things of the truth and good of faith in one complex; "besides babe," signifies the good of innocence; "and a great mixed multitude 
also," signifies goods and truths which are not genuine; "went up with them," signifies which are adjoined; "and flock, and herd, a very great acquisition," signifies the good acquired by means 
of truth, interior and exterior, in great abundance; "and they baked the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes," signifies that from the truth of good there was again produced 
good in which was nothing of falsity; "for it had not been leavened," signifies because in the truth from good there was nothing of falsity; "because they were driven out of Egypt, and could not 
tarry," signifies because they were removed from those who were in falsity from evil; "and moreover, they had not prepared for themselves any provision for the journey," signifies that they had with 
them no other sustenance from truth and good. </p>

Verses 37-39 And the children of Israel travelled from Rameses to Succoth, around six hundred thousand men (vir) on foot, besides young children. And also a large mixed crowd went up with them, and flocks 
and herds, an extremely large acquisition of them. And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt - unleavened cakes, since no yeast was added, because they were driven out of Egypt and 
could not wait, and also had not made for themselves provision for the way.  </p>
<p>'And the children of Israel travelled from Rameses to Succoth' means the first state of departure and the essential nature 
of it. 'Around six hundred thousand men on foot' means all aspects of the truth and good of faith in their entirety. 'Besides young children' means the good of innocence. 'And also a large mixed 
crowd' means truths [and forms of good]<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that were not genuine. 'Went up with them' means which were joined on. 'And flocks and herds, an extremely large acquisition of them' means good acquired through 
truth, interior and exterior, a great abundance of it. 'And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt - unleavened cakes' means that from the truth of good further good was produced that 
had no falsity at all in it. 'Since no yeast was added' means since the truth from good had no falsity at all within it. 'Because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait' means because they 
were removed from those steeped in falsity arising from evil. 'And also had not made for themselves provision for the way' means that they did not have with them any other support from truth and good.

Vers. 37-39.  Et profecti filii Israelis de Raamses ad Succoth, quasi sescenta milia peditum virorum, praeter infantem.  Et etiam turba mixta multa ascendit cum illis, et grex et armentum acquisitio 
gravis valde.  Et coxerunt massam quam eduxerunt ex Aegypto, placentas azymas, quia non fermentata, quia expulsi ex Aegypto, et non potuerunt commorari, et etiam viaticum non fecerunt sibi.  `Et profecti 
filii Israelis de Raamses ad Succoth' significat statum primum discessionis et quale: `quasi sescenta milia peditum virorum' significat omnia veri et boni fidei in uno complexu: `praeter infantem' 
significat bonum innocentiae: `et etiam turba mixta multa' significat vera et bona quae non genuina: `ascendit cum illis' significat quae adjuncta: `et grex et armentum acquisitio gravis valde' significat 
bonum acquisitum per verum, interius et exterius, copia multa: `et coxerunt massam quam eduxerunt ex Aegypto, placentas azymas' significat quod ex vero boni iterum produceretur bonum in quo nihil 
falsi: `quia non fermentata' significat quia in vero ex bono nihil falsi inesset: `quia expulsi ex Aegypto, et non potuerunt commorari' significat {1}quoniam remoti ab illis qui in falso ex malo erant: 
`et etiam viaticum non fecerunt sibi' significat quod non aliam sustentationem a vero et bono secum haberent. 	@1 quia I$ </p>
