<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2702节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2702.</strong>“她就看见一口水井”表主的圣言，真理就来自圣言。这从“水井”和“泉”的含义，以及“水”含义清楚可知：“水井”和“泉”既指圣言，也指取自圣言的教义，因而亦指真理本身；“水”是指真理。有水的“井”和“泉”表主的圣言，也表取自圣言的教义，因而表真理本身，这一事实从许多经文可以看出来。此处说的是“井”，而非“泉”，是因为所论述的主题是属灵教会，本章下面几节经文也一样：<br />亚伯拉罕指责亚比米勒，因为亚比米勒的仆人霸占了一口水井。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.25.htm">21:25</a>）<br /><p>26章也是如此：<br />以撒的父亲亚伯拉罕在世的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的所有井，非利士人全都封住了。他父亲亚伯拉罕在世的日子他们所挖的水井，非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后封住了，以撒回来又挖出来。以撒的仆人在谷中挖井，便得了一口活水井，在那里找到一口活水井。他们又挖了一口井，他们不为这井争竞了。那一天以撒的仆人来，将他们挖井的事告诉他，对他说，我们找到水了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.15.htm">26:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.18.htm">18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.32.htm">32</a>）<br />此处“井”表示他们所争竞的教义和不争竞的教义，并非表示别的。否则，他们挖井，并为了这些井多次争竞就显得无足轻重，在神圣的圣言中不值一提。<br />摩西书所提及的“井”同样表示圣言，或教义：<br />他们到了比珥（“比珥”就是“井”的意思）；从前耶和华对摩西说，招聚百姓，我好给他们水喝。说的就是这井。那时，以色列人就唱了这首歌：井啊，涌上来吧！你们在回应这井。这井是首领们所挖的，是百姓愿意立法用他们的杖所挖掘的。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.16.htm">21:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.18.htm">18</a>）<br />由于“井”表这些事物，故以色列中就有了这首预言歌曲，歌曲论述了真理的教义，这从每个细节的内义明显看出来。“比珥”（即井）之名由此而来，“别是巴”之名也由此而来，就内义而言，它含义是指教义本身。<br />但是，其中没有真理的教义被称为“坑或池”，或“没有水的井”，如耶利米书：<br />他们的贵胄打发家僮打水，他们来到池边，见没有水，就拿着空器皿回来了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.3.htm">14:3</a>）<br />此处“水”表真理，“他们见没有水的池边”表其中没有真理的教义。同一先知书：<br />我的百姓犯了两项罪：他们离弃我这活水的泉源，为自己凿出池子，是破裂不能存水的池子。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.13.htm">2:13</a>）<br />此处“池子”同样表不正确的教义，“破裂的池子”表被毁坏的教义。<br />“泉”表圣言，也表教义，因而表真理。这一事实可见于以赛亚书：<br />困苦穷乏人寻求水却没有，他们因口渴，舌头干燥。我耶和华必应允他们；我以色列的神必不离弃他们。我要在山坡上开江河，在谷中开泉源；我要使旷野变为水池，使干地变为水泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.17.htm">41:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处首先论述了真理的荒凉，以“困苦穷乏人寻求水却没有，他们因口渴，舌头干燥”来表示；然后论述了他们的安慰、精神焕发、荒凉后的教导（和现在所解释有关夏甲的那几节经文一样），由“耶和华要在山坡上开江河，在谷中开泉源；要使旷野变为水池，使干地变为水泉”来表示；所有这些事都关系到真理的教义和由此而来的情感。<br />摩西书：<br />以色列安然独居在雅各泉边，在五谷新酒之地，他的天也滴下甘露。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.28.htm">33:28</a>）<br />“雅各泉”表圣言和由此而来的真理的教义。正是因为雅各泉表圣言和由此而来的真理的教义，故当主来到雅各泉边时，祂与撒马利亚的妇人交谈，并教导“泉”和“水”的含义，如约翰福音所描述的那样：<br />耶稣到了撒马利亚的一座城，名叫叙加，雅各泉就在那里；耶稣因旅行劳累，就这样坐在泉旁。有一个撒马利亚的妇人来打水，耶稣对她说，请你给我喝。耶稣说，你若知道神的恩赐和对你说“给我喝”的是谁，你必早求祂，祂也必早给了你活水。凡喝这水的，还要再渴；谁若喝我所赐给他的水，就永远不渴。我所赐给他的水要在他里头成为水泉，直涌到永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.5.htm">4:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />由于“雅各泉”表圣言，“水”表真理，“撒马利亚”表属灵的教会（这是圣言中的常见情形），故主与撒马利亚的妇人交谈，并教导真理的教义来自祂；当真理的教义来自祂，或也可说，来自祂的圣言时，它就是直涌到永生的水泉；真理本身就是活水。<br /><br />耶稣说，人若渴了，让他到我这里来喝；信我的人，就如经上所说：从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.37.htm">7:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">38</a>）<br />启示录：<br />宝座中的羔羊必牧养他们，领他们到生命的水泉；神也必擦去他们眼上的一切泪水。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.17.htm">7:17</a>）<br /><br />我要将生命的水泉白白赐给那口渴的人喝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>）<br />“活水的江河”和“生命的水泉”表来自主或来自其圣言的真理；因为主就是圣言。爱与仁之善唯独来自主，是真理的生命。人若具有对真理的爱与情感，就被说成是“口渴的人”；别人不可能如此“口渴”。<br />这些真理在以赛亚书中还被称为“救恩的泉源”：<br />你们必从救恩的泉源欢然取水；在那日，你们要说，当承认耶和华，求告祂的名。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛12.3.htm">12:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛12.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“泉源”就是圣言，或取自圣言的教义。这一事实也明显可见于约珥书：<br />到那日，大山要滴甜酒，小山要流奶子，犹大的一切溪河都有水流。必有泉源从耶和华的殿中流出来，浇灌什亭河。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br />此处“水”表真理；“出于耶和华殿的泉源”表主的圣言。<br />耶利米书：<br />看哪，我必将他们从北国领来，把他们从地极招集起来，在他们中间有瞎子、瘸子；他们要哭泣而来，我要照恳求领他们到水泉旁，行在平直的路上，在其上不致绊跌。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.8.htm">31:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“平直路上的水泉”明显表真理的教义；“北国”表对真理的无知或真理的荒凉；“哭泣”和“恳求”表他们悲伤绝望的状态；被“领到水泉旁”表在真理方面的精神焕发和教导，如此处，也就是论述夏甲和她儿子的地方一样。<br />同样的事在以赛亚书也有所描述：<br />旷野和干旱之地必因它们欢喜，沙漠也必快乐，又像玫瑰开花。必开花繁盛，乐上加乐，而且欢唱；黎巴嫩的荣耀，并迦密与沙仑的华美，必赐给它；他们必看见耶和华的荣耀，我们神的华美。你们要使软弱的手坚壮，无力的膝稳固。瞎子的眼必睁开，聋子的耳必开通；在旷野必有水喷出，在沙漠必有溪河涌流；干燥之地要变为水池，干渴之地要变为水泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.1.htm">35:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.5.htm">5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“旷野”表真理的荒凉；“水”、“溪河”、“水池”和“水泉”表令那些经历消磨之人精神焕发和快乐的真理，此处用很多话来描述他们的快乐。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华使泉源涌入山谷，奔流在山间；供给田野的各种走兽水喝，野驴得解其渴。祂从楼阁中浇灌群山。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.10.htm">104:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“泉源”表真理；“群山”表对良善与真理的爱；“给水喝”表教导；“田野的走兽”表那些照此教导生活的人（参看<a href="774.htm">774</a>，<a href="841.htm">841</a>，<a href="908.htm">908</a>节）；“野驴”表那些只有理性真理之人（<a href="1949.htm">1949</a>-<a href="1951.htm">1951</a>节）。<br />摩西书：<br />约瑟是多结果子的人，是泉旁多结果的人。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.22.htm">49:22</a>）<br />“泉”表取自圣言的教义。申命记：<br />耶和华你神领你进入美地，那地有河、有水、有泉、有深渊从谷中和山中流出来。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.7.htm">8:7</a>）<br />“地”表主的国度和教会（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="2571.htm">2571</a>节），它因爱与仁之善而被称为“美”；“河”、“水”、“泉”和“深渊”表源于这善的真理。申命记：<br />迦南地，乃是有山有谷，有天上雨水滋润之地。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.11.htm">11:11</a>）<br />“水”表真理，无论属灵的还是理性的，也表记忆知识的真理。这一点从以赛亚书中的这些经文明显看出来：<br />看哪，主万军之耶和华从耶路撒冷和犹大，除掉众人所倚靠的粮，所仗赖的水。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.1.htm">3:1</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你拿水来给口渴的，拿饼来迎接逃难的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.14.htm">21:14</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你们在各水边撒种的有福了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.20.htm">32:20</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />行事公义，说话正直的必居高处；他的粮必赐给，他的水必可靠。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />那时，他们并不干渴，祂必引导他们经过沙漠，祂必为他们使水从磐石流出，分裂磐石，水就涌出。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.21.htm">48:21</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.8.htm">8</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.11.htm">20:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.13.htm">13</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />祂在旷野分裂磐石，多多地给他们水喝，如从深渊而出。祂使溪水从磐石涌出，叫水如江河下流。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.15.htm">78:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.16.htm">16</a>）<br />此处“磐石”表主；“水、河，以及来自它的<br />深渊”表源于祂的真理。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华使江河变为旷野，叫水泉变为干旱之地；祂使旷野变为水池，叫旱地变为水泉。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.33.htm">107:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.35.htm">35</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华的声音发在水上；耶和华在大水之上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.3.htm">29:3</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />有一道河，这河的支流，使神的城欢喜，就是至高者帷幕的圣所。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.4.htm">46:4</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />诸天藉耶和华的话而造；其万象藉祂口中的气而成；祂聚集海水如垒，收藏深洋在库房。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.6.htm">33:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.7.htm">7</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />你眷顾地，以它为大乐；你使地大为肥沃，神的河满了水。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.9.htm">65:9</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />神啊，诸水见你，诸水一见了你，深渊也都战抖。云中倒出水来；你的道在海中，你的路在大水中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.16.htm">77:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.19.htm">19</a>）<br />谁都能明显看出，此处的“水”并非表示水，“深渊战抖”、“耶和华的道在海中，祂的路在水中”也并非字面上的意思；所表示的属灵之水，也就是属于真理的属灵之物；否则，这不过是一堆空话而已。以赛亚书：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的，你们也来买。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />那日，必有活水从耶路撒冷出来，它们一半往东海流，一半往西海流。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.8.htm">14:8</a>）<br />此外，在圣言中，当论述的主题是即将建立或已经建立的教会，并且该教会被描述为乐园、园子、果园，或各种树时，它通常也被描述为诸水，或灌溉的河，诸水或河要么表示属灵的、理性的事物，要么表示记忆之物，这些事物都属于真理。如创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.8.htm">2:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.9.htm">9</a>）中所描述的园子在那里（2:10-14）也被描述为河，河表智慧聪明之物（参看<a href="107.htm">107</a>-<a href="121.htm">121</a>节）。在圣言中，同样的例子也出现很多其它地方，如摩西书：<br />如他们安放的山谷，如河旁的园子，如耶和华所栽的沉香树，如水边的香柏木；水要从他的桶里流出，他的种要撒在多水之处。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.6.htm">24:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.7.htm">7</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />他将那地的种栽在撒种的地里，插在大水旁；它抽芽生长，成了一棵茂盛的葡萄树。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.5.htm">17:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“葡萄树”和“葡萄园”表属灵的教会（参看<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>节）。同一先知书：<br />你的母亲好比葡萄树，在你的像中，栽于水旁。因为水多，她就多结果子，满生枝子。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结19.10.htm">19:10</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />看哪，亚述曾是黎巴嫩的香柏树；众水滋润他，深水使他长高，他所栽的有她的江河围流；她汊出的水道延到田野诸树。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.3.htm">31:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.4.htm">4</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />见在河这边与那边的岸上有极多的树木。他对我说，这些水往东方的边界流去，必下到平原，直到海；所发出来的水既流入海，就得医治。两条河所到之处，一切滋生活物都必存活；并且必有极多的鱼，因这些水到那里来；它们必得医治，这河所到之处，百物都必存活。只是泥泞之地与洼湿之处不得治好，留作盐地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.7.htm">47:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处描述的是新耶路撒冷，或主的属灵国度：“往东方的边界流去的水”表从属天之物所流出的属灵之物，就是来自属天源头的真理，也就是源于爱与仁的信（<a href="101.htm">101</a>，<a href="1250.htm">1250</a>节）。“下到平原”表属于理性的教义（<a href="2418.htm">2418</a>，<a href="2450.htm">2450</a>节）。“直到海”表记忆知识；“海”是知识的汇集（<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）；“滋生的活物”表它们的快乐（<a href="746.htm">746</a>，<a href="909.htm">909</a>，<a href="994.htm">994</a>节），这些快乐会“通过河水而存活”，也就是通过来自属天源头的属灵之物而存活。“极多的鱼”表丰富的可应用的记忆知识（<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="991.htm">991</a>节）。“泥泞之地与洼湿之处”表不能应用的不洁之物；“留作盐地”表被荒废了（<a href="2455.htm">2455</a>节）。耶利米书：<br />信靠耶和华的，那人有福了；他必像树栽于水旁，在河边扎根。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他要像一棵树栽在河水旁，按季节结果子。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗1.3.htm">1:3</a>）<br />启示录：<br />他又指示我一道生命水的河，明亮如水晶，从神和羔羊的宝座流出来。在城内街道当中，就是河这边与那边有生命树，结十二样果子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.1.htm">22:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.2.htm">2</a>）<br />由于就圣言的内义而言，“水”表真理，故在犹太教会，为了以属灵的方式看待仪式的天使面前的代表物，经上要求祭词和利未人在即将履行职责时，要用水洁净自己，并且要用置于会幕与祭坛之间的洗濯盆里的水洗，然后用铜海和圣殿周围其它所有洗濯盆里的水洗，这些水就代替泉源。同样，为了代表物，还设立了一个仪式，就是将除罪水弹在利未人身上（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.7.htm">8:7</a>）；也有一个仪式涉及用红母牛的灰调制除污秽的水（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.2.htm">19:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.19.htm">19</a>）；从米甸人那里得来的战利品要用水洁净（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.19.htm">31:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.25.htm">25</a>）。<br />磐石所涌出的水（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.8.htm">8</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.1.htm">20:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.13.htm">13</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.15.htm">8:15</a>）代表和表示从主而来的丰富属灵事物或信之真理。被木头治好的苦水（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.23.htm">15:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.25.htm">25</a>）代表和表示，不讨人喜的真理因良善，即对良善的情感而变得可接受和喜人。“木”表构成情感或意愿的良善（参看<a href="643.htm">643</a>节）。综上所述，可知在圣言中，“水”表示什么，洗礼的水因此又表示什么。关于洗礼的水，主在约翰福音中这样说：<br />人若不是从水和灵生的，就不能进神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.5.htm">3:5</a>）<br />也就是说，“水”表信的属灵成分，“灵”表信的属天成分；因此，洗礼是主藉着信之真理与良善使人重生的象征。人的重生不是通过洗礼实现的，而是通过洗礼所表示的生活实现的。拥有信之真理的基督徒因为拥有圣言，故必须进入这种生活，</p>

And she saw a well of water. That this signifies the Lord's Word from which are truths, is evident from the signification of a "well of water," and of a "fountain," as being the Word, and also doctrine 
from the Word, consequently also truth itself; and from the signification of "water," as being truth. That a "well in which there is water," and a "fountain," denote the Lord's Word, and also doctrine 
from the Word, consequently also truth itself, may be seen from very many passages. A "well," and not a "fountain," is spoken of here, because the spiritual church is treated of, as also in the following

<p>     Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well which the servants of Abimelech had taken away (Gen. 22:25). So too in the twenty-sixth chapter: </p>
<p>     All the wells 
which the servants of Isaac's father digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped up. And Isaac returned, and digged the wells of water which they had digged in the days of 
Abraham his father, and the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of living water. And they digged another well, 
and for that they strove not. And it came to pass in that day that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water (Gen. 26:15, 18-20, 
21-22, 25, 32). Here by "wells" nothing else is signified than doctrinal matters about which they contended, and those about which they did not contend. Otherwise their digging wells and contending 
so many times about them would not be of so much importance as to be worthy of mention in the Divine Word. [2] The "well" spoken of by Moses signifies in like manner the Word, or doctrine: </p>
<p>    
 They journeyed to Beer; this is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; answer ye from it. The 
princes digged the well, the willing of the people digged it, in the lawgiver, with their staves (Num. 21:16-18). As a "well" signified these things, there was therefore this prophetic song in Israel, 
in which the doctrine of truth is treated of, as is evident from every particular in the internal sense. Hence came the name "Beer" [a well], and hence the name "Beersheba," and its signification in 
the internal sense, as being doctrine itself. [3] But doctrine in which there are no truths is called a "pit," or a "well in which there is no water" as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Their nobles have sent their 
little ones to the water; they came to the pits, they found no water; they returned with their vessels empty (Jer. 14:3); </p>
<p>where "waters" denote truths; and "pits where they found no water," doctrine 
in which there is no truth. In the same: </p>
<p>     My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me the fountain of living waters, to hew them out pits, broken pits, that can hold no waters (Jer. 
2:13); </p>
<p>where "pits" in like manner denote doctrines that are not true; and "broken pits," fabricated doctrines. [4] That a "fountain" is the Word, and also doctrine, consequently truth, may be 
seen in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The afflicted and the needy seek waters, and there are none; their tongue faileth for thirst. I Jehovah will hear them, the God of Israel will not forsake them; I will open rivers 
upon the hillsides, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of waters, and the dry land springs of waters (Isa. 41:17-18); </p>
<p>where the desolation of truth is treated 
of, which is signified by the afflicted and needy seeking for waters when there are none, and by their tongue failing for thirst; and then their consolation, refreshment, and instruction after desolation 
are treated of (as in the verses about Hagar now being explained), signified by Jehovah opening rivers upon the hillsides, making fountains in the midst of the valleys, and the wilderness into 
a pool of waters, and the dry land into springs of waters; all which things relate to the doctrine of truth, and to the affection thence derived. [5] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Israel dwelt securely alone at the 
fountain of Jacob, in a land of corn and new wine; yea, his heavens drop down dew (Deut. 33:28). The "fountain of Jacob" denotes the Word and the doctrine of truth therefrom. Because the "fountain 
of Jacob" signified the Word and the doctrine of truth therefrom, when the Lord came to the fountain of Jacob, He spoke with the woman of Samaria, and taught what is signified by a "fountain" and by 
"water," as described in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, and Jacob's fountain was there; Jesus therefore being wearied with His journey, sat thus by the fountain. There cometh 
a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto her, Give Me to drink: Jesus said, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give Me to drink, thou wouldst ask of Him 
that He should give thee living water. Everyone that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall 
give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto eternal life (John 4:5-7, 10, 13-14). As "Jacob's fountain" signified the Word, the "water" truth, and " Samaria" the spiritual church 
(as is frequently the case in the Word), the Lord spoke with the woman of Samaria, and taught that the doctrine of truth is from Him; and that when it is from Him, or what is the same, from His Word, 
it is a fountain of water springing up unto eternal life; and that truth itself is living water. [6] Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink; whosoever believeth 
in Me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:37-38). And in the same: </p>
<p>     The Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead 
them unto living fountains of water; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes (Rev. 7:17). In the same: </p>
<p>     I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 
(Rev. 21:6); </p>
<p>"rivers of living water," and "living fountains of waters," denote truths that are from the Lord, or from His Word; for the Lord is the Word. The good of love and of charity, which is 
solely from the Lord, is the life of truth. He is said to be "athirst" who is in the love and affection of truth; no other can "thirst." [7] These truths are also called "fountains of salvation" in Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    With joy shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation; and in that day shall ye say, Confess to Jehovah, call upon His name (Isa. 12:3-4). That a "fountain" is the Word, or doctrine 
from it, is plain also in Joel: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streams of Judah shall flow with 
waters, and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah, and shall water the stream of Shittim (Joel 3:18); </p>
<p>where "waters" denote truths; and a "fountain out of the house of Jehovah," the 
Lord's Word. [8] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the sides of the earth; and among them the blind and the lame; they shall come with weeping, 
and with supplications will I bring them unto fountains of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble (Jer. 31:8-9); </p>
<p>"fountains of waters in a straight way" manifestly denote the doctrinal 
things of truth; the "north country," ignorance or desolation of truth; "weeping" and "supplications," their state of grief and despair; and to be "brought to the fountains of waters," refreshment 
and instruction in truths (as here, where Hagar and her son are treated of). [9] The same things are also thus described in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad for them, 
and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose; budding it shall bud, and shall rejoice even with rejoicing and singing; the glory of Lebanon has been given unto it, the honor of Carmel and Sharon; 
they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the honor of our God. Make ye firm the enfeebled hands, and strengthen the tottering knees. The eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf 
shall be unstopped; in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert; and the dry place shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of waters (Isa. 35:1-3, 5-7); </p>
<p>where the 
"wilderness" denotes the desolation of truth; "waters," "streams," "lakes," and "springs of waters," the truths that are a refreshment and joy to those who have been in vastation, whose joys are there 
described with many words. [10] In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah sendeth forth fountains into the valleys, they shall run among the mountains; they shall give drink to every wild beast of the field, the wild 
asses shall quench their thirst. He watereth the mountains from His chambers (Ps. 104:10-11, 13); </p>
<p>"fountains" denote truths; "mountains," the love of good and truth; to "give drink," instructing; "wild 
beasts of the field," those who live from this (see n. 774, 841, 908); "wild asses," those who are solely in rational truth (n. 1949-1951). [11] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, 
the son of a fruitful one by a fountain (Gen. 49:22); </p>
<p>a "fountain" denotes doctrine from the Lord. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of rivers, of waters, of 
fountains, and of depths going forth in valley and in mountain (Deut. 8:7); </p>
<p>the "land" denotes the Lord's kingdom and church (n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 2571); which is called "good" from the 
good of love and charity; "rivers," "waters," "fountains," and "depths," denote the truths thence derived. In the same: </p>
<p>     The land of Canaan, a land of mountains and valleys, that drinketh water of 
the rain of heaven (Deut. 11:11). [12] That "waters" are truths, both spiritual and rational, and also those of memory-knowledge, is manifest from these passages in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold the Lord Jehovih 
Zebaoth doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the whole staff of bread, and the whole staff of water (Isa. 3:1). In the same: </p>
<p>     Bring ye waters to him that is thirsty; meet the fugitive 
with his bread (Isa. 21:14). In the same: </p>
<p>     Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters (Isa. 32:20). In the same: </p>
<p>     He that walketh in righteousnesses, and speaketh uprightnesses, shall dwell 
on high; his bread shall be given, his waters shall be faithful (Isa. 33:15, 16). In the same: </p>
<p>     Then shall they not thirst, He shall lead them in the desert, He shall cause the waters to flow 
out of the rock for them; He cleaveth the rock also, and the waters flow out (Isa. 48:21; Exod. 17:1-8; Num. 20:11, 13). [13] In David: </p>
<p>     He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them to 
drink abundantly as out of the deeps. He brought streams out of the rock and caused waters to run down like a river (Ps. 78:15, 16); </p>
<p>where the "rock" denotes the Lord; "waters," "rivers," and "deeps" 
from it, denote truths from Him. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah maketh rivers into a wilderness, and water-springs into dry ground; He maketh a wilderness into a pool of waters, and a dry land into water-springs 
(Ps. 107:33, 35). In the same: </p>
<p>     The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters; Jehovah is upon many waters (Ps. 29:3). In the same: </p>
<p>     A river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city 
of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High (Ps. 46:4). In the same: </p>
<p>     By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the army of them by the breath of His mouth; He gathereth 
the waters of the sea together as a heap, He layeth up the deeps in storehouses (Ps. 33:6, 7). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou dost visit the earth, and delightest in it greatly; thou enrichest it, the 
river of God is full of waters (Ps. 65:9). In the same: </p>
<p>     The waters saw Thee, O God, the waters saw Thee, the deeps also trembled; the clouds poured out waters; Thy way was in the sea, and Thy 
path in many waters (Ps. 77:16, 17, 19).      It is manifest to everyone that the "waters" here do not signify waters, and that it is not meant that the deeps trembled, nor that the way of Jehovah was 
in the sea, and His path in the waters; but that spiritual waters are meant, that is, spiritual things which are of truth; otherwise this would be a heap of empty words. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ho every one 
that thirsteth, come ye to the waters and he that hath no silver, come ye, buy (Isa. 55:1). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half 
of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea (Zech. 14:8). [14] Moreover where the church is treated of in the Word as about to be planted and as having been planted, and 
where it is described by a paradise, a garden, a grove, or by trees, it is usual for it to be also described by waters or rivers which irrigate; by which either spiritual, rational, or memory things 
(which are of truth) are signified-as in the description of Paradise in Genesis (2:8, 9); which is also described by the rivers there (verses 10 to 14), signifying the things of wisdom and intelligence 
(see n. 107-121). The same is true in many other places in the Word, as in Moses: </p>
<p>     As valleys are they planted, as gardens by the river, as sandal-wood trees which Jehovah hath planted, as cedars 
beside the waters; waters shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters (Num. 24:6, 7). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     He took of the seed of the land, and planted it in a field of sowing, 
he placed it beside many waters; it budded, and became a luxuriant vine (Ezek. 17:5, 6); </p>
<p>that a "vine" and a "vineyard" signify the spiritual church may be seen above (n. 1069). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thy 
mother was like a vine in thy likeness, planted by the waters; she became fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters (Ezek. 19:10). In the same: </p>
<p>     Behold Asshur was a cedar in Lebanon; 
the waters nourished him, the deep made him high, going with her rivers round about his plant; and she sent out her canals unto all the trees of the field (Ezek. 31:4). [15] In the same: </p>
<p>     Behold 
upon the bank of the river were very many trees on this side and on that. He said unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern border, and shall go down into the plain, and shall go toward 
the sea; and being sent into the sea the waters are healed. And it shall be that every living soul that creepeth, in every place whither the two rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great 
multitude of fish, because these waters are come thither; and they shall be healed, so that everything whithersoever the river cometh shall live. The miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall 
not be healed; they shall be given up to salt (Ezek. 47:7-9, 11). Here the New Jerusalem, or the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is described: the "waters going forth to the eastern border," signify spiritual 
things from celestial things, which are truths from a celestial origin; that is, faith from love and charity (n. 101, 1250). To "go down into the plain," signifies doctrinal things which are of 
the rational (n. 2418, 2450). To "go toward the sea," signifies to memory-knowledges; the "sea" is the collection of them (n. 28); the "living soul which creepeth," signifies their delights (n. 746, 
909, 994); which will "live from the waters of the river," that is, from spiritual things from a celestial origin. "Much fish" denotes an abundance of applicable memory-knowledges (n. 40, 991). The "miry 
places and the marshes" denote things not applicable and impure; being "given up to salt," denotes being vastated (n. 2455). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah; he shall 
be like a tree planted by the waters, and that sendeth forth its roots by the river (Jer. 17:7-8). In David: </p>
<p>     He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit 
in its season (Ps. 1:3). In John: </p>
<p>     He showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb; in the midst of the street of it, and 
on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits (Rev. 22:1-2). [16] Seeing that in the internal sense of the Word "waters" signify truths, therefore in the Jewish Church, 
for the sake of representation before the angels with whom the rituals were viewed spiritually, it was commanded that the priests and Levites should wash themselves with water when they came near 
to minister, and indeed out of the laver between the tent and the altar; and later, out of the brazen sea and the other lavers around the temple, which were in place of a fountain. So too for the sake 
of the representation was the institution of the water of sin or of purgation that was to be sprinkled upon the Levites (Num. 8:7); also that of the water of separation, from the ashes of the red heifer 
(Num. 19:2-19); and that the spoils from the Midianites should be cleansed by water (Num. 31:19-25). [17] The waters which were given out of the rock (Exod. 17:1-8; Num. 20:1-13; Deut. 8:15) represented 
and signified an abundance of spiritual things or truths of faith from the Lord. The bitter waters which were healed by the wood (Exod. 15:23-25) represented and signified that the truths which 
are not pleasing become acceptable and grateful from good, that is, from the affection of it. (That "wood" signifies good which is of affection, or of the will, may be seen above, n. 643.) From all 
this it may now be known what "water" denotes in the Word, and hence what the water in baptism denotes, of which the Lord speaks thus in John: </p>
<p>     Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he 
cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5); </p>
<p>namely, that "water" is the spiritual of faith, and the "spirit" the celestial of it; thus that baptism is the symbol of the regeneration of man by 
the Lord by means of the truths and goods of faith. Not that regeneration is effected by baptism, but by the life signified in baptism, into which life Christians who have the truths of faith, because 
they have the Word, must come. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2702</b></p><p><b>2702.</b>
'And she saw a well of water' means the Lord's Word from which truths are drawn. This is clear from the meaning of 'a well of water' and of 'a spring' as the Word, also as doctrine drawn from the Word, 
and consequently as truth itself, dealt with in what follows immediately below; and from the meaning of 'water' as truth. That 'a well' which has water in it, and 'a spring', mean the Word of the Lord, 
also doctrine drawn from the Word, and so consequently truth itself, may become clear from very many places. Here because the subject is the spiritual Church the word 'well' and not spring is used 
in subsequent verses of this chapter, </p>
<p>Abraham reproached Abimelech on account of the well which Abimelech's servants had seized (verse 25). </p>
<p>Also in Genesis <a href="26.htm">26</a>, </p>
<p>All the wells which the servants 
of Isaac's father had dug, in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up. And Isaac returned and dug [again] the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, 
for the Philistines had been stopping them up after Abraham's death. And Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living waters. And they dug another well and disputed over that 
also. And he moved on from there and dug another well, and they did not dispute over that. And it happened on that day, that Isaac's servants came and pointed out to him the reasons for the well which 
they had dug; and they said to him, We have found waters (verses 15, 18-22, 25, 32). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In these verses nothing else is meant by 'wells' than matters of doctrine - both those about which they disputed, 
and those about which they did not. Otherwise their digging of wells and their disputing so many times about them would not be important enough to be mentioned in the Divine Word. </p>
<p>'The well' 
referred to in Moses in a similar way means the Word or doctrine, </p>
<blockquote>
They travelled to Beer. This was the well of which Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people and I will give them water. Then Israel 
sang this song: Spring up, O well! Answer from it! The well which the princes dug, which the willing ones<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the people dug out, as directed by the law-giver, with their staves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:%2016-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21: 16-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Because 
'a well' meant the Word, doctrine drawn from it, and truth itself, this prophetic song therefore existed in Israel - a song in which the doctrine of truth is the inner theme, as is clear from 
everything contained in the internal sense. From this the name Beer is derived, and the name Beersheba,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and its meaning in the internal sense as doctrine itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Doctrine however that has no 
truths in it is called 'a pit', or a well with no water in it, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Their illustrious ones sent their lesser ones to the water; they came to the pits; they found no water; they returned 
with their vessels empty. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14: 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'waters' stands for truths, 'the pits in which they found no waters' for doctrine that has no truth within it. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
My people have committed 
two evils; they have forsaken Me, the source of living waters, to hollow out pits for themselves, broken pits, which cannot hold water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here in a similar way 'pits' stands for doctrines 
that are not true, 'broken pits' for matters of doctrine that have been ravaged. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards 'a spring' meaning the Word, also doctrine, and therefore truth, this is seen in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
afflicted and the needy were seeking water, and there was none; their tongue was parched with thirst. I Jehovah will hearken to them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers on 
the sloping heights, and springs in the midst of valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into streams of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:%2017,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41: 17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the first place this refers to 
the desolation of truth, which is meant by the statements that 'the afflicted and needy sought water and there was none', and that 'their tongue was parched with thirst'. Then it refers, as in the present 
verses in Genesis where Hagar is the subject, to the comfort, renewal, and instruction following desolation, which are meant by the promise that 'Jehovah will open the rivers on the sloping heights, 
will place springs in the midst of valleys, make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into streams of water', all of which have to do with the doctrine of truth and the affection 
acquired from this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Israel dwelt securely, alone at Jacob's spring, in a land of corn and new wine; even his heavens distil the dew. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33: 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Jacob's spring' stands for 
the Word and the doctrine of truth drawn from it. It was because Jacob's spring meant the Word, and the doctrine of truth drawn from it, that when the Lord came to Jacob's spring He talked to the woman 
from Samaria and taught what is meant by the spring and by water. The incident is described in John as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus came to a city of Samaria called Sychar. Jacob's spring was there. Jesus therefore, 
weary from the journey, sat thus by the spring. A woman from Samaria came to draw water, to whom Jesus said, Give Me a drink. Jesus said, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who is saying 
to you, Give Me a drink, you would ask of Him to give you living water. Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but he who drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But 
the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%204:-5-7,10,13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 4:-5-7,10,13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Because 'Jacob's spring' meant the Word, 'water' truth, and 'Samaria' the 
spiritual Church, as is the case many times in the Word, therefore the Lord talked to the woman from Samaria and taught that the doctrine of truth is derived from Himself, and that when it is derived 
from Himself, or what amounts to the same, from His Word, it is 'a spring of water welling up into eternal life'; also that the truth itself is 'living water'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Similar teaching occurs in the same 
gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, If anyone thirsts let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, as the scripture says, Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%207:-37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 7:-37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the 
Book of Revelation, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and will guide them to living springs of water; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7: 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
To him who thirsts I will give from the spring of living water without price. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Rivers of living water' and 'living springs of water' stand for truths which are derived 
from the Lord, that is, from His Word, for the Lord is the Word. The good of love and charity which comes solely from the Lord is the life of truth. The expression 'he who thirsts' is used of one 
who is stirred by a love and affection for truth; no other can so thirst.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 These truths are also called 'the springs of salvation' in Isaiah, </p>

<p>That 'a spring' means the Word, or doctrine drawn from it, is also evident in Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on 
that day, that the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will run with milk, and all the streams of Judah will run with water, and a spring will come forth from the house of Jehovah and will water 
the river of Shittim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:-18</a>.

 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold I am bringing them from the north 
land, and I will gather them from the extremities of the earth, among them the blind one and the lame. With weeping they will come, and with supplications I will bring them to springs of water in a straight 
path on which they will not stumble. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Springs of water in a straight path' plainly stands for matters of doctrine concerning truth. 'The north land' stands for the lack of knowledge 
or the desolation of truth, 'weeping and supplications' for their state of grief and despair. 'Being brought to springs of water' stands for renewal and instruction in truths, as in this chapter 
of Genesis where Hagar and her son are the subject. </p>

<p><b>[9]</b>
 The same matters are presented in Isaiah as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
The wilderness and the dry land will be glad for them; and the lonely place will rejoice 
and blossom like the rose. It will bud prolifically, and will rejoice also with rejoicing and singing. The glory of Lebanon has been given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see 
the glory of Jehovah, the majesty of our God. Strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees. The eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Waters will break forth 
in the wilderness, and streams in the lonely place; and the dry place will become a pool and the thirsty ground wellsprings of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2035:%201-3,%205-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 35: 1-3, 5-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a wilderness' stands for a desolation 
of truth. 'Waters', 'streams', 'a pool', 'wellsprings of water' stand for truths which serve to renew and give joy to people who have experienced vastation and whose joys are described in many ways 
here. </p>

rational, or factual kind, which are matters of truth.

 Now because 'waters' means truths in the internal sense of the Word it was therefore 
commanded in the Jewish Church, for the sake of representation before the eyes of the angels who beheld ritual acts in a spiritual way, that the priests and Levites should wash themselves with 
water when they came to perform their duties, and that they should do so with water from the layer placed between the tent and the altar, and later on with water from the bronze sea and all the other 
lavers around the temple, which were there in place of a spring. In a similar way for the sake of representation the ritual involving the water of sin or of expiation which was to be sprinkled over 
the Levites was established, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%208:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 8: 7</a>, also the ritual involving the water of separation from the ashes of the red cow, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2019:%202-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 19: 2-19</a>, as well as the requirement that spoils taken from the Midianites

faith from the Lord.

virtue of good, that is, of the affection for it - 'wood' meaning good which constitutes affection or the will, see <a href="643.htm">643</a>. From these considerations one may now see what 'water' means in the Word, and 
from this what the water used in baptism means, regarding which the Lord says the following in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Unless a person has been born from water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, 'water' means the spiritual constituent of faith, and 'the spirit' the celestial constituent of it, so that baptism is the symbol of man's regeneration by the Lord by means 
of the truths and goods of faith. Not that a person's regeneration is accomplished in baptism, but by the life, the sign of which life is denoted in baptism, and into which life Christians who possess 
the truths of faith because they have the Word must enter.

est cum muliere e Samaria, et docuit quid per fontem, et per aquam significatur; de quibus ita apud Johannem, 	Jesus venit in urbem Samariae dictam Sichar;... erat ibi fons Jacobi; Jesus itaque 
fessus ex itinere, consedit sic apud fontem;... venit mulier ex Samaria ad hauriendum aquas, cui dicit Jesus, Da Mihi bibere:... dixit Jesus, Si scires donum Dei, et quis sit qui dicit tibi, Da Mihi 
bibere, tu peteres ab Eo, ut daret tibi aquam viventem;... omnis qui bibit ex aqua hac, sitiet iterum; qui vero biberit ex aqua, quam Ego dabo ei, non sitiet in aeternum, sed aqua quam Ego dabo ei, fiet 
in eo fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam, iv 5-7, 10, 13, 14; </p>
<p>quia `fons Jacobi' significabat Verbum, `aqua' verum, et `Samaria Ecclesiam spiritualem, ut pluries in Verbo, ideo locutus est Dominus 
cum muliere e Samaria, et docuit quod doctrina veri sit ab Ipso, et quod cum ab Ipso, seu quod idem, a Verbo Ipsius, sit `fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam,' et quod ipsum verum `aqua vivens': 
[6] similiter apud eundem, 	Jesus dixit, Si quis sitiverit, venito ad Me, et bibito, quisquis, credit in Me, sicut dicit scriptura, flumina e ventre illius fluent aquae viventis, vii 37, 38: </p>
<p>et apud 
eundem, 	Agnus, qui in medio throni, pascet eos, et deducet eo ad vivos fontes aquarum, et delebit Deus omnem lacrimam ab oculis eorum, Apoc. vii 17: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ego sitienti dabo ex fonte aquae 
vitae gratis, Apoc. 	xxi 6; </p>
<p>`flumina aquae viventis,' et `vivi fontes aquarum' pro veris quae a Domino, seu a Verbo ipsius, nam Dominus est Verbum; bonum amoris et charitatis, quod unice a Domino, 
est vita veri; `sitiens' dicitur qui in amore et affectione veri, alius non sitire {7} potest.  [7] Vera illa vocantur etiam `fontes salutis' apud Esaiam, 	Haurietis aquas in laetitia ex fontibus salutis, 
et dicetis in die illo, Confitemini Jehovae, invocate nomen Ipsius, xii 3, 4: </p>
<p>quod `fons' sit Verbum, seu doctrina inde, patet etiam apud Joelem, 	Fiet in die illo, stillabunt montes mustum, 
et colles ibunt lacte, et omnes rivi Jehudae ibunt aquis, et fons e domo Jehovae exibit, et irrigabit flumen Shittim, iv 18; </p>
<p>ubi `aquae' pro veris, `fons e domo Jehovae' pro Verbo Domini: [8] apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce 
Ego adducens eos e terra septentrionis, et congregabo eos e lateribus terrae, inter eos caecus et claudus;... in fletu venient, et in precibus adducam eos ad fontes aquarum in via recti, 
non impingent in ea, xxxi 8, 9; </p>
<p>`fontes aquarum in via recti' manifeste pro doctrinalibus veri; `terra septentrionis' pro ignorantia seu desolatione veri, `fletus et preces' pro eorum doloris et desperationis 
statu; `adduci ad fontes aquarum' pro recreatione et instructione in veris; sicut hic ubi de Hagare et filio ejus: [9] de iisdem quoque ita apud Esaiam, 	Gaudebunt iis desertum et siccitas; 
et exsultabit solitudo, et florebit sicut rosa; germinando germinabit, et exsultabit etiam exsultatione et cantando; gloria Libani data est illi, honor Carmeli et Sharonis; illi videbunt gloriam Jehovae, 
honorem Dei nostri; confirmate manus remissas, et genua labentia roborate.... Aperientur oculi caecorum, et aures surdorum (x)patebuntur;... erumpent in deserto aquae, et fluvii in solitudine, 
et erit aridus locus in lacum, et siticulosus in scaturigines aquarum, xxxv 1-3, 	5-7; </p>
<p>ubi `desertum' pro desolatione veri; `aquae, fluvii, lacus, scaturigines aquarum' pro veris quae recreationi et 
gaudio, illis qui in vastatione fuerunt, quorum gaudia ibi multis describitur: [10] apud Davidem, 	Jehovah emittit fontes in vallibus, inter montes ibunt; potum praebebunt omni ferae agrorum, frangent 
onagri sitim suam:... irrigat montes e conclavibus suis, Ps. civ 10, 11, 13; </p>
<p>`fontes' pro veris; `montes' pro amore boni et veri; `potum praebere' pro instruere; `ferae agrorum' pro illis qui inde 
vivunt, videatur n. 774, 841, 908; `onagri' pro illis qui solum in vero rationali sunt, n. 1949-1951: [11] apud Mosen, 	Filius fecundae Josephus,  filius fecundae juxta fontem, Gen. xlix 22; </p>
<p>`fons' 
pro doctrina a Domino: apud eundem, 	Jehovah Deus tuus introducet te in terram bonam, terram fluviorum aquarum {8}, fontium, abyssorum exeuntium in valle et 	in monte, Deut. viii 7; </p>
<p>`terra' pro regno 
Domini et Ecclesia, n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 2571, quae `bona' dicitur ex bono amoris et charitatis; `fluvii {9}, aquae fontes et abyssi' pro veris inde: apud eundem, 	Terra Canaan, terra montium 
et vallium, ad pluviam caeli {10} imbibit aquas, Deut. xi 11. [12]	Quod `aquae' sint vera tam spiritualia quam rationalia, ut et scientifica, patet ab his locis, apud Esaiam, 	Ecce Dominus Jehovah 
Zebaoth, removens a Hierosolymae et a Jehudah,... omnem baculum panis, et omnem baculum aquae, iii 1: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Obviam sitienti adferte aquas, cum pane ejus praevenite vagantem, xxi 14 apud 
eundem, 	Beati vos seminantes juxta omnes aquas, xxxii 20: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Qui ambulat in justitiis, et loquitur rectitudines,... in altis habitabit,... panis illius dabitur, aquae illius fideles, 
xxxiii 15, 16: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Tunc non sitient, in deserto ducet eos, aquas e petra effluere faciet illis; et findit petram, et effluunt {11} aquae, xlviii 21; Exod. xvii 1-8; Num. (x)xx 11, 13: </p>
<p>apud 
Davidem, 	Diffindit petras in deserto, et bibere fecit ut abyssos multum, eduxit {12} fluenta e petra, et descendere fecit sicut flumen aquas Ps. lxxviii 15, 16; </p>
<p>ubi `petra' pro Domino, `aquae, flumina 
et abyssi inde' pro veris ab ipso: [13] apud eundem 	Jehovah ponit fluvios in desertum, et exitus aquarum 	in siccitatem:... ponit desertum in lacum aquarum, et terram siticulosam exitus aquarum, 
Ps. cvii 33, 35: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Vox Jehovae super aquis; Jehovah super aquis multis, 	Ps. xxix 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Fluvius, rivi ejus laetificabunt civitatem Dei, sanctum habitaculorum Altissimi, 
Ps. xlvi 5 [A.V. 4]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Per verbum Jehovae caeli facti sunt, et per spiritum oris Ipsius omnis exercitus eorum; colligens sicut cumulum aquas maris, dans in thesauris abyssos, Ps. xxxiii 
6, 7: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Visitas terram, et delectaris ea, plurimum {13} ditas eam, rivus Dei plenus aquis, Ps. lxv 10 [A.V. 9]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Viderunt Te aquae Deus, viderunt Te aquae,... commotae sunt 
abyssi; effuderunt aquas nubes;... in mari via Tua, et semita Tua in aquis multis, Ps. (x)lxxvii 17, 18, 20 [A.V. 16, 17, 19]; </p>
<p>hic quod non `aquae' significent aquas, nec quod `abyssi commotae sint,' 
et quod `Jehovae via in mari, et semita in aquis,' cuivis patet, sed quod aquae spirituales sint, hoc est, spiritualia quae sunt veri; alioquin esset cumulus vocum inanium: apud Esaiam, 	Heu omnis 
sitiens ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite, emite, lv 1: </p>
<p>apud Zachariam, 	Fiet in die illo, exibunt aquae vivae ex Hierosolyma, dimidia pars earum ad mare orientale, et dimidia pars earum 	ad mare 
posterius, xiv 8. [14] Praeterea ubi de Ecclesia plantanda et plantata agitur in Verbo, et illa describitur per paradisum, hortum, lucum, aut per arbores, sollemne est ut quoque describatur per aquas 
aut fluvios qui irrigant, per quos significantur spiritualia, rationalia aut scientifica, quae sunt veri; sicut paradisus, Gen. ii 8, 9, qui quoque describitur per `fluvios' ibi vers. 10-14, per 
quos significantur illa quae sunt sapientiae et intelligentiae, videatur n. 107-121; similiter pluries alibi in Verbo; ut apud Mosen, 	Sicut valles plantantur, sicut horti juxta fluvium, sicut santalos 
plantavit Jehovah, sicut cedros juxta aquas; defluent aquae e situlis ejus, et semen ejus in aquis multis, Num. xxiv 6, 7: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Accepit de semine terrae, et posuit id in agro sementis, 
accepit juxta aquas multas,... germinavit, et factum est in vitem luxuriantem, xvii 5, 6; </p>
<p>quod `vitis et vinea' significet Ecclesiam spiritualem, videatur n. 1069: apud eundem, 	Mater tua, sicut 
vitis in similitudine tui, juxta 	aquas plantata, frugifera et ramosa facta est ab aquis 	multis, xix (x)10: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ecce Asshur in Libano,... aquae crescere fecerunt eam, abyssus altam fecit 
eam, cum fluviis suis vadens circumcirca	plantam ejus, et aquaeductus suos emisit ad omnes arbores agri, xxxi 4 [A.V. 3]: </p>
<p>[15] apud eundem, 	Ecce ad ripam fluvii arbor multa valde, hinc et illinc; dixit 
ad me, Aquae hae exeuntes ad terminum orientalem, et descendunt super planitiem, ac veniunt versus mare, in mare emissae, et sanantur aquae; et erit, omnis anima vivens quae reptat, ad omne quo venit 
duorum fluviorum, vivet; et erit piscis multus valde, quia veniunt illuc aquae hae, et sanantur, ut vivat omne quo venit fluvius.... Coenosa ejus et paludes ejus, et non sanantur, in Salem dabuntur, 
xlvii 7-9, 11; </p>
<p>ibi de Nova Hierosolyma, seu regno spirituali Domini; `aquae exeuntes ad terminum orientalem' significant spiritualia quae a caelestibus, quae sunt vera ex origine caelesti, hoc est, 
fidem ex amore et charitate, n. 101, 1250; `descendere in planitiem' significant {14} doctrinalia quae rationalis, n. 2418, 2450; `venire versus mare' significat ad scientifica, `mare' est collectio 
eorum, n. 28; `anima vivens quae reptat' significat oblectamenta eorum, n. 746, 909, 994, quae vivent `ex aquis fluvii,' hoc est, a spiritualibus ex origine caelesti; `piscis multus' pro scientificorum 
applicabilium abundantia, n. 40, 991; `coenosa et paludes' pro inapplicabilibus et impuris; `abire in salem' pro vastari, n. 2455: apud Jeremiam, 	Benedictus vir, qui confidit in Jehovah,... erit 
sicut arbor plantata juxta aquas, et juxta rivum emittit radices suas, xvii 7, 8: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Erit sicut arbor plantata juxta rivos aquarum, quae fructum suum dabit in tempore suo, Ps. i 3: </p>
<p>apud 
Johannem, 	Ostendit mihi purum fluvium aquae vitae, splendidum sicut crystallum, exeuntem e throno Dei et Agni; in medio plateae ejus et fluvii hinc et illinc arbor vitae, faciens fructus duodecim, 
Apoc. xxii 1, 2. [16]	Quia nunc `aquae' significant vera in sensu interno Verbi, ideo in Ecclesia Judaica {15}, repraesentationis causa coram angelis, apud quos ritualia spectata sunt spiritualiter, 
mandatum (o)est, ut sacerdotes et Levitae aquis se lavarent {16}, cum accederent ad ministrandum, et quidem ex labro inter tentorium et altare, et postea ex mari aeneo, et ceteris labris circa templum, 
quae erant loco fontis. Similiter propter repraesentationem institutum de `aqua peccati seu purgationis quae spargeretur super Levitas,' Num. viii 7.  Tum de `aqua separationis ex cinere vaccae rufae,' 
Num. xix 2-19.  Quod `spolia a Midianitis mundarentur per aquam,' Num. xxxi 19-25.  [17] `Aquae quae datae ex petra,' Exod. xvii 1-8; Num. xx 1-13; {17}, repraesentabant et significabant abundantiam 
spiritualium seu verorum fidei a Domino; `aquae amarae quae sanatae per lignum,' Exod. xv 22-25, repraesentabant et significabant vera quae non placent, quod ex bono seu ejus affectione, accepta et 
grata fiant; quod `lignum' significet bonum quod affectionis seu voluntatis, videatur n. 643.  Ex illis (o)nunc sciri potest quid `aqua' in Verbo, et inde quid `aqua in baptismo,' de quo Dominus ita 
apud Johannem, 	Nisi quis generatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu, non potest ingredi in regnum Dei, iii 5, quod nempe `aqua' sit spirituale fidei, et `spiritus' caeleste ejus, ita quod baptismus sit symbolum 
regenerationis hominis a Domino per vera et bona fidei; non quod per baptismum sit regeneratio, sed per vitam significatam in baptismo, in quam Christiani qui vera fidei, quia Verbum, habent, 
intrabunt. 	@1 i aquae.$ 	@2 sui.$ 	@3 In all other places except 3424 S has per legislatorem.$ 	@4 Heb. [ ] (maqor). In 3623 and elsewhere S has fons for this word.$ 	@5 relinquet I.$ 	@6 sed.$ 	@7
