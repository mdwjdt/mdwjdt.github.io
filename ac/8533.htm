<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8533节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8533.</strong>“留给你们的后代”表是那些属于属灵教会之人的度量。这从“一俄梅珥吗哪”的含义清楚可知，存放起来以保留的“一俄梅珥吗哪”是指足够的量（参看<a href="8468.htm">8468</a>节），因而也指一个度量，也就是说，该教会所拥有的良善的量；“你们的后代”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="8526.htm">8526</a>节）。至于一个教会所拥有的良善的度量或程度，要知道，在来世，一切良善在质和量上都各不相同，对每个人来说，在他活在世上期间，它们就确定了；它们取决于每个人在生活上的信与仁的质和量。在来世，当主允许时，每个人的良善的质和量都会显现在天使面前；因为它们能呈现在天堂之光中，但不能呈现在世界之光中。一般来说，良善，即教会的良善也是这样。在圣言中，每个人或教会所拥有的良善的质和量都由重量或度量来代表；在目前的情况下，存在耶和华面前以保留的“一俄梅珥吗哪”代表以色列人所代表的属灵教会之良善的量。</p>

To be kept for your generations. That this signifies that it may be the measure for those who are of that spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "an omer of manna," which was laid up 
to be kept, as being as much as is sufficient (see n. 8468), thus also a measure, namely, of the amount of good this church had. (That "your generations" denotes those who are of the spiritual church, 
see n. 8526.) As regards the measure or degree of good that belongs to a church, be it known that goods in the other life vary in quality and in quantity, and that they are determined for everyone during 
his life in the world; they are determined according to the quality and quantity of each person's faith and charity in his life. When the Lord grants, the quality and quantity of the good of everyone 
in the other life is manifested before the angels; for it can be presented to view in the light of heaven, but not in the light of the world. The case is the same in general, namely, in respect to 
the good of the church. The quantity and the quality of the good belonging to every individual, and to the church, are represented by weights and by measures in the Word; in the present case the quantity 
of the good of the spiritual church which is represented by the sons of Israel, by the "omer of manna" that was laid up before Jehovah to be kept. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8533</b></p><p><b>8533.</b>
'To be kept for your generations' means to be the measure for those belonging to that spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of the omer of man[na] which was laid up 'to be kept', as the sufficient 
amount, dealt with in <a href="8468.htm">8468</a>, thus also the measure, that is to say, amount of good this Church had, 'your generations' being those who belong to the spiritual Church, see above in <a href="8526.htm">8526</a>. As regards 
the measure or degree of the good the Church possesses, it should be recognized that all good in the next life is clearly defined so far as the character and volume of it is concerned, and that it 
is clearly defined with every person while he lives in the world. What defines it is the character and amount of the particular person's faith and charity in life. The character and volume of every 
person's good is revealed in the next life before angels when the Lord allows such to be revealed; for they can be demonstrated in the light of heaven, but not in the light of the world. The same is so 
with good in general, that is to say, with the Church's good. The volume and character of the good which each person or the Church possesses is represented in the Word by weights and measures; in the 
present instance the volume or amount of good in the spiritual Church, the Church represented by the children of Israel, is represented by the omer of manna that was laid up to be kept, before Jehovah. </p>

`Ad custodiam generationibus vestris': quod significet ut sit mensura illis qui ab Ecclesia illa spirituali, constat ex significatione `omeris man' qui ad custodiam reponebatur, quod sit quantum satis, 
de qua n. 8468, ita quoque mensura, nempe quantum boni huic Ecclesiae {1} esset; quod `generationes vestrae' sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, videatur supra n. 8526.  Quod mensuram seu gradum boni 
quod Ecclesiae, attinet, sciendum quod bona in altera vita definita sint quoad quale et quoad quantum, et quod apud unumquemvis definiuntur cum vivit in mundo; definiuntur secundum quale et quantum cujusvis 
fidei et charitatis in vita; quale et quantum boni cujusvis in altera vita, patet coram angelis cum Dominus hoc concedit, nam sisti potest videndum in luce caeli non autem in luce mundi; similiter 
in communi, nempe bonum Ecclesiae; quantum et quale boni quod cuivis et {2} Ecclesiae, repraesentatur {3} per pondera et per mensuras in Verbo, hic quantum boni Ecclesiae spiritualis, quae repraesentatur 
per `filios Israelis,' per `omerem mannae,' quae reponebatur ad custodiam coram Jehovah. 	@1 i spirituali$ 	@2 i quod$ 	@3 i et significatur$ </p>
