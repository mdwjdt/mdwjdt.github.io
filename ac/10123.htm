<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10123节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10123</strong>.“你要在坛上从罪中清洁”表在天堂和教会中，从邪恶中洁净。这从“洁净”、“罪”和“坛”的含义清楚可知：“清洁”是指洁净；“罪”是指邪恶，因为来自人的一切邪恶都被称为“罪”；“坛”是指神性良善方面的主和对祂的敬拜的一个代表（参看<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>，<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节），在此是指天堂和教会中的神性良善方面的。由于所论述的主题仍是主的流注、同在，以及那里对祂的接受，所以“坛”也表示就接受来自主的神性良善而言的天堂和教会。事实上，正是主的神性构成天堂和教会，因为主在那里是住在自己的东西里面，而不是住在人自己的东西里面。这也解释了为何“坛”还表示有天堂或教会存在于里面，因而有主存在于里面的这个人自己；在从人抽象出来的意义上，“坛”表示来自主并与天堂天使和教会成员同在的良善本身。<br />启示录就提到了这些意义上的“祭坛”：<br />有一根像量杖的芦苇赐给我；天使站在旁边，说，将神的殿和祭坛，并在殿中礼拜的人都量一量。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.1.htm">11:1</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“神的殿”和“祭坛”是指天堂和教会，“殿”是指属灵教会，“祭坛”是指属天教会；“量”是指认识真理和良善的量和质；这就是为何经上不仅说量“神的殿和祭坛”，还说量“在殿中礼拜的人”。“殿”是指属灵教会（参看<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）；“量”是指认识事务在真理和良善方面的状态（<a href="9603.htm">9603</a>节）。<br />我又听见另一位天使从祭坛中说，主神，全能者阿，你的判断义哉，诚哉。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.7.htm">16:7</a>）<br />“从祭坛中”表示从至内在天堂中，就属天良善掌权的地方；属天良善就是对主之爱的良善。耶利米哀歌：<br />主丢弃自己的祭坛，憎恶自己的圣所。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.7.htm">2:7</a>）<br />“丢弃祭坛和圣所”是指丢弃教会的一切；“祭坛”是指教会在良善方面的一切，“圣所”是指教会在真理方面的一切。</p>

And thou shalt cleanse it from sin upon the altar. That this signifies purification from evils in heaven and in the church, is evident from the signification of "cleansing," as being to purify; from 
the signification of "sin," as being evil, for all the evil from man is called "sin;" and from the signification of "the altar," as being a representative of the Lord as to Divine good, and of the worship 
of Him (see n. 9714, 9964), here as to Divine good in heaven and in the church. As the subject treated of is still the influx, presence, and reception of the Lord there, hence it is that by "the 
altar" is also signified heaven and the church in respect to the reception of Divine good from the Lord there; for it is the Divine of the Lord which makes heaven and the church, because the Lord dwells 
there in His own, and not in man's own. Hence also it is that by "the altar" is likewise signified the man himself in whom is heaven, or in whom is the church, thus in whom is the Lord; and abstractedly 
from person "the altar" denotes the good itself which is from the Lord with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church. [2] In these senses "the altar" is mentioned in John: </p>
<p>     There 
was given to me a reed like unto a rod; and the angel stood, saying, Measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein (Rev. 11:1). In this passage "the temple of God" and "the 
altar" denote heaven and the church, "the temple" denotes the spiritual church, and "the altar" the celestial church; "to measure" denotes to know the quantity and quality of truth and good, and therefore 
it is not only said, "Measure the temple and the altar," but also "them that worship therein." (That "the temple" denotes the spiritual church, see n. 3720; and that "to measure" denotes to know 
the state of a thing as to truth and good, n. 9603.) Again: </p>
<p>     I heard another angel from the altar saying, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Thy judgments (Rev. 16:7); </p>
<p>"from the altar" 
denotes from the inmost heaven, where celestial good reigns; celestial good is the good of love to the Lord. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord hath forsaken His altar, He hath abhorred His sanctuary (Lam. 2:7); </p>
<p>"to 
forsake the altar and the sanctuary" denotes to forsake everything of the church; "the altar" denoting everything of the church in respect to good, and "the sanctuary," everything of the church 
in respect to truth. </p>

'And you shall cleanse from sin on the altar' means purification from evils in heaven and in the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'cleansing' as purifying; from the meaning of 'sin' as evil, 
for all evil that a person is guilty of is called sin; and from the meaning of 'the altar' as that which is representative of the Lord in regard to Divine Good and of the worship of Him, dealt with in <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>, <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>, at this point in respect of Divine Good in heaven and in the Church. The subject is still the Lord's influx, presence, and reception there, and for this reason 'the altar' also means heaven 
and the Church in respect of reception of Divine Good from the Lord there. For that which is Divine and the Lord's is what makes heaven and the Church; this is so because the Lord dwells there in 
what is His and not in what is a person's own. This too explains why 'the altar' also means the actual person in whom heaven is present or in whom the Church is present, and so in whom the Lord is present; 
and in the abstract sense, in which no actual person is envisaged, 'the altar' means the Good itself which comes from the Lord and is present with the angels of heaven and with members of the Church.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The word 'altar' is used with these meanings in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I was given a reed like a rod, and the angel stood and said to me, Measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship 
in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2011:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 11:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the temple of God, and the altar' are heaven and the Church, 'the temple' being the spiritual Church and 'the altar' the celestial Church. 'Measuring' means recognizing 
the amount and the essential nature of truth and good; and this is why it says not only 'Measure the temple, and the altar' but also 'those who worship in it'. For the meaning of 'the temple' as the spiritual 
Church, see <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>; and for that of 'measuring' as recognizing the state of affairs as regards truth and good, <a href="9603.htm">9603</a>. In the same book,  </p>
<blockquote>
I heard another angel from the altar saying, O Lord God 
Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgements. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2016:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 16:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'From the altar' means from the inmost heaven, where celestial good reigns, celestial good being the good of love to the Lord. In Jeremiah, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord has abandoned His altar, He has abominated His sanctuary. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Abandoning the altar and the sanctuary' refers to everything of the Church, 'the altar' being everything of 
the Church as regards good, and 'the sanctuary' everything of the Church as regards truth.  </p>

`Et mundabis a peccato super altari': quod significet purificationem a malis in caelo et in Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `mundare' quod sit purificare, ex significatione `peccati' quod sit malum, 
nam omne malum ab homine vocatur peccatum, et ex significatione `altaris' quod sit repraesentativum Domini quoad Divinum Bonum et Ipsius cultus {1}, de qua n. 9714, 9964, hic quoad Divinum Bonum 
in caelo et in Ecclesia; quia continuatur adhuc de influxu, praesentia, et receptione Domini (d)ibi, inde est quod etiam per `altare' significetur caelum et Ecclesia quoad receptionem Divini Boni a Domino 
ibi; est enim Divinum Domini quod facit caelum et Ecclesiam, quoniam Dominus habitat ibi in Suo et non in proprio hominis; inde (d)quoque est quod per `altare'{2} etiam significetur ipse homo in 
quo est caelum, seu in quo est Ecclesia, ita in quo est Dominus, et abstracte a persona `altare' est ipsum Bonum quod a Domino apud angelos caeli (o)et apud homines Ecclesiae; [2] in his sensibus dicitur 
`altare' apud Johannem,      	Datus est mihi calamus similis baculo, et adstitit angelus, dixit mihi, Metire templum Dei et altare, et adorantes in eo, Apoc. xi 1; </p>
<p>ibi `templum Dei et altare' sunt 
{3} caelum et Ecclesia, `templum' est Ecclesia spiritualis, et `altare' est Ecclesia caelestis; `metiri' est cognoscere quantum et quale veri et boni {4}, (o)quapropter modo dicitur metire templum 
et altare, sed etiam `adorantes in eo'; quod `templum' sit Ecclesia spiritualis, videatur n. 3720, et quod `metiri' sit cognoscere statum rei quoad verum et bonum, n. 9603: apud eundem,      	Audivi 
alium angelum ex altari, dicentem, Domine Deus omnipotens, vera et justa judicia Tua, Apoc. xvi 7; </p>
<p>`ex altari' est ex caelo intimo, ubi caeleste bonum regnat; caeleste bonum est bonum amoris in Dominum: 
apud Jeremiam,      	Deseruit Dominus altare Sunt, abominatus est sanctuarium Suum, Threni ii 7; </p>
<p>`deserere altare et sanctuarium' est omne Ecclesiae, `altare' omne Ecclesiae quoad bonum, et `sanctuarium' 
(o)omne Ecclesiae quoad verum. @1 Before quoad$ @2 After etiam$ @3 est$ @4 i ibi$ </p>
