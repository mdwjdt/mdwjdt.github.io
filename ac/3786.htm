<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3786.</strong>“不是牲畜聚集的时候”表教会和教义事物的良善和真理尚不能集为一体。这从“时候”、“聚集”和“牲畜”的含义清楚可知：“时候”（time）是指总体状态（<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3254.htm">3254</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>节）；“聚集”是指合为一体；“牲畜”通常是指构成教会及其教义事物的良善与真理。“牲畜”通常具有这种含义，是因为在代表性教会的宗教仪式和圣言中，活物表示对良善与真理的情感。这从前面的说明（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>，<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节）可以看出来。由于良善与真理构成教会及其教义事物，而这些是内义所论述的主题，故显而易见，“不是牲畜聚集的时候”表教会和教义事物的良善和真理尚不能合为一体。就代表意义而言，关于这些的情形如下：正在抛弃旧的状态，接受新的状态，也就是正在重生的人在此之前必须学习和具备构成教会及其教义事物的良善与真理。因为认知，以及对它们的情感是接受新生命的器皿。这就是为何在经历生命的适当时期，也就是一个状态结束之前，没有人能得以重生（参看<a href="677.htm">677</a>，<a href="679.htm">679</a>，<a href="711.htm">711</a>，<a href="1555.htm">1555</a>，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2636.htm">2636</a>，<a href="2679.htm">2679</a>，<a href="2697.htm">2697</a>，<a href="2979.htm">2979</a>，<a href="3203.htm">3203</a>，<a href="3502.htm">3502</a>，<a href="3508.htm">3508</a>，<a href="3510.htm">3510</a>，<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>，<a href="3699.htm">3699</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>节）。<br />教会的情形通常也一样。当教会正重新建立时，良善与真理的教义事物必须被收集起来，合为一体，因为它们是教会得以建立的基础。而且，教义事物彼此有联结和相互关联。因此，如果它们不首先集合为一体，就会有缺陷，所缺失的东西必由人的理性来提供。而这理性在靠自己得出结论时，在属灵和神性的事上何等瞎眼和虚幻，这在各处已经说明。由于这个原因，圣言被赐给教会，它包含良善与真理的一切教义事物。在这方面，总体的教会和正在重生的具体个人，其情形是一样的，因为这样的个人就是具体的教会。在人重生之前，属于教会的良善与真理的教义事物必须在他里面被聚集起来，这一点在前面已经说明。这些良善与真理就是“看哪，日头还高，不是牲畜聚集的时候”在内义上所表示的。</p>

It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. That this signifies that the goods and truths of the churches and of doctrinal things could not yet be gathered into a one, is evident from the 
signification of "time," as being state in general (n. 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356); from the signification of "being gathered together," as being to be in a one; and from the signification of "cattle," 
as being in general the goods and truths of churches and of doctrinal things. That "cattle" in general have this signification, is because in the rituals of the representative church, and in the Word, 
animals signify the affections of good or of truth; as may be seen from what has been shown above (n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 2679, 2697, 2979, 3203, 3502, 3508, 3510, 3665, 3699, 3701). [2] 
The case is the same in general with the church when it is being set up again-the doctrinal things of good and truth must be collected into a one, for it is on these that it is built. Moreover doctrinal 
things have a connection with and mutual respect to each other, and therefore unless they are first collected into a one, there will be a defect, and that which is lacking must be supplied by 
man's rational; and how blind and illusory this is in spiritual and Divine things, when its conclusions are from itself, has been abundantly shown above. For this reason there has been given to the church 
the Word, which contains all the doctrinal things of good and truth. In this regard, with a man who is being regenerated, the case is the same with the church in general as it is with the church 
in particular; for such a man is the church in particular. That the doctrinal things of good and truth which belong to the church must needs first be together in a man before he is regenerated has been 
shown above. This then is what is signified in the internal sense by "Behold as yet the day is great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3786</b></p><p><b>3786.</b>
'It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together' means that goods and truths constituting the Churches and their matters of doctrine were not yet gathered into one. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'time' as state in general, dealt with in <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3254.htm">3254</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>; from the meaning of 'being gathered together' as being made into one; and from the meaning of 'the cattle' in general as 
goods and truths constituting the Churches and their matters of doctrine. The reason why 'the cattle' in general has this meaning is that in the religious observances of the representative Church, and 
in the Word, living creatures mean affections for what is good and for what is true, as becomes clear from what has been shown in <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>. 
And since goods and truths constitute the Churches and their matters of doctrine, and these are the subject in the internal sense, it is evident that 'not time for the cattle to be gathered together' 
means that the goods and truths constituting the Churches and their matters of doctrine are not yet gathered into one. The situation with these in the representative sense is as follows: The person 
who is casting aside the old state and assuming the new, that is, who is being regenerated, must prior to this learn and be endued with the goods and truths that constitute the Churches and their matters 
of doctrine. For cognitions, and also affections for them, are the vessels which receive the new life. This is why nobody is able to be regenerated until he is passing through the appropriate period 
of life, that is, until one state has been completed, see what has been shown in <a href="677.htm">677</a>, <a href="679.htm">679</a>, <a href="711.htm">711</a>, <a href="1555.htm">1555</a>, <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2636.htm">2636</a>, <a href="2679.htm">2679</a>, <a href="2697.htm">2697</a>, <a href="2979.htm">2979</a>, <a href="3203.htm">3203</a>, <a href="3502.htm">3502</a>, <a href="3508.htm">3508</a>, <a href="3510.htm">3510</a>, <a href="3665.htm">3665</a>, <a href="3699.htm">3699</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is in 
general the same with the Church. When this is being re-established matters of doctrine concerning good and truth have first to be gathered into one since they are the base on which it is built. Matters 
of doctrine also have connections one with another and relate one to another. Consequently unless they are first gathered into one a defect would exist and things that are missing would have to be 
supplied from the person's rational. And how blind and deluded the rational is so far as spiritual and Divine things are concerned when it relies on itself in the conclusions it reaches has been shown 
in various places already. To the Church therefore the Word has been given which contains all matters of doctrine concerning good and truth. In this respect the Church answers in a general way to what 
exists in particular with the individual who is being regenerated, for he is the Church in particular. The point that with any person matters of doctrine concerning good and truth which are the Church's 
ought first to be gathered together in him before regeneration takes place has been stated above. It is those goods and truths that are meant in the internal sense by 'Behold, it is still high 
day; it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together'. </p>

`Non tempus colligi pecudes{1}':  quod significet quod nondum in unum bona et vera Ecclesiarum et doctrinalium, constat ex significatione `temporis' quod sit status in genere, de qua n. 2625, 2788, 
2837, 3254, 3356; ex significatione `colligi' quod sit in unum esse; et a significatione `pecudum {1}' quod sint in genere bona et vera Ecclesiarum et doctrinalium: quod pecudes {1} in genere significent 
illa, est quia animalia in ritualibus Ecclesiae repraesentativae et in Verbo sunt affectiones boni aut veri, ut constare potest ex illis quae n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, [776 , 1823, 
2179, 2180, 2781, 3218, 3519, ostensa sunt; et quia bona et vera sunt Ecclesiarum et doctrinalium, et de illis in sensu interno agitur, patet, quod per `non tempus colligi pecudes {1}' significetur 
quod nondum in unum sint bona et vera Ecclesiarum et doctrinalium: cum his se ita in sensu repraesentativo habet: apud hominem qui exuit veterem statum et induit novum, hoc est, qui regeneratur, 
prius quam id fit, addiscet et imbuet bona et vera quae Ecclesiae et doctrinalium, cognitiones enim, tum affectiones pro illis, sunt vasa quae recipient novam vitam, inde est quod nemo nisi in procedente 
aetate, seu in statu pleno, regenerari possit, videantur n. 677, 679, 711, 1555, 2046, 2063, 2636, {2}] 2697, 2979, 3203, 3502, 3508, 3510, 3665, 3699, 3701 ostensa sunt (o) similiter se 
habet in communi cum Ecclesia; eum haec instauratur, primum erunt in unum doctrinalia boni et veri, haec enim sunt super quibus exstruitur; habent etiam doctrinalia inter se nexum seque mutuo spectant, 
quare nisi in unum prius sint, mancum erit {3}, et quae deficiunt, a rationali hominis supplenda (o)essent, quod quantum {4} caecutit et hallucinatur in spiritualibus et Divinis dum ex se concludit, 
prius passim ostensum est; ideo Ecclesiae datum est Verbum, in quo omnia doctrinalia boni et veri sunt; </p>
<p>Ecclesia in communi se habet in hoc, sicut in particulari cum homine qui regeneratur, 
hic enim est Ecclesia in particulari; apud hominem {5} quod prius simul esse debeant doctrinalia boni et veri quae Ecclesiae, antequam regeneratur, supra dictum est; haec sunt quae in sensu interno 
significantur per `ecce adhuc dies magnus, non tempus colligi pecudes.' @1 singular A$ @2 This serious omission, evident from the confusion in the references, can be explained as due to a printer's 
error. If the group of numbers beginning at line 8 were written in MS `45, 46, ... 715' on one line, and the remainder, `776, ... 3519' on next line, and the group beginning at line 19 also split, 
`677,... 2636' on one line, and `2679,...3701' on next line, then the omission can be accounted for by the compositor, when he had set up the first line of first group, looking back for second line 
and by mistake going to second line of second group.$ @3 esset$ @4 i nempe rationale$ @5 hunc$ </p>
