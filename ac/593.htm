<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第593节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>593.</strong>“土地上我造的人”指上古教会后代中的人类。这一点不仅从“祂创造的人”，即祂重生的人这句话中所用“创造”一词明显看出来，也从后来“祂作成人”，即祂完善或重生人直到他变成属天这句话中所用“作成”一词看出来，还可从“土地上”这一表述看出来。“土地”就是教会所在之地，如前所述。另外，从以下事实也清楚可知，即所谈论的对象是将信的教义事项浸没于自己恶欲之人，而那些没有信之教义的人不可能这样做。教会之外的人不知道真理和良善，那些不知道的人即便说了或做了某些违背信之真与善的事，尚有几分无辜，因为他们出于一种从小被灌输的敬拜的热情行事，他们由此以为这就是真理与良善。但拥有信之教义者的情况完全不同。这些人会将真理与虚假，以及圣物与亵渎混在一起，因此，他们在来生（灵界）的命运比那些所谓的外邦人要糟糕得多，关于他们，蒙主慈悲，以后再予以分析。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]593.</strong> The symbolism of whom I created from the face of the ground as those who were descendants of the earliest church can be seen from several things. The first is that the text speaks of the human he created (that is, regenerated) and later of the human whom he made (that is, perfected, or in other words, regenerated to the point of becoming heavenly). The second is that it says from the face of the ground, the ground being the area where the church is, as shown earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_593/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566-567</a>].<br />Another indication is that the discussion treats of those who merged the teachings of faith with their appetites. People who had no access to the doctrine of the true faith could not commit this offense. Those outside the bounds of the church live in ignorance about what is true and good, and people who live in ignorance can have a certain kind of innocence even when they say or do something that violates the truth and goodness of faith. They may be driven by a zeal for the worship that they grew up with and that they consequently consider true and good.<br />The case is completely different with those who have the doctrine of the [true] faith among them. These are capable of mingling truth with falsity, and holiness with profanation. Their lot in the other life is accordingly much worse than the lot of those called Gentiles, who will be discussed below, the Lord in his divine mercy willing.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the spiritual condition of non-Christians, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_593/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1032" target=_top>1032-1033</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_593/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059" target=_top>1059</a>.

Whom I have created, from upon the faces of the ground. That this signifies the man from the posterity of the Most Ancient Church, is evident not only from its being said, the man whom He had "created" 
that is, whom He had regenerated; and afterwards whom He had "made" that is, had perfected, or regenerated until he became celestial; but also from its being said "from upon the faces of the ground." 
The "ground" is where the church is, as has been shown before. The same is evident from the fact that those are treated of who immersed the doctrinal things of faith in their cupidities; and those 
who had not doctrinal things of faith could not do so. They who are outside the church are in ignorance of truth and good, and those who are in ignorance may be in a kind of innocence while speaking and 
acting somewhat contrary to the truths and goods of faith; for they may act from a certain zeal for the worship with which they have been imbued from infancy, and which they therefore believe to be 
true and good. But the case is entirely different with those who have the doctrine of faith among them. These can mingle truths with falsities, and holy things with profane. Hence their lot in the other 
life is much worse than the lot of those who are called Gentiles, concerning whom, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

'Whom I have created from upon the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground' means mankind among the descendants of the Most Ancient Church. This is clear not only from the use of the word 'created' in the phrase 'man whom 
He created', that is, whom He regenerated, and subsequently from the use of the word 'made' in the phrase 'whom He made', that is, whom He perfected or regenerated to the point of his becoming celestial; 
but also from the use of the expression 'from upon the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground'. The ground is where the Church is, as shown already. It is additionally clear from the fact that the subject is the 
people who immersed doctrinal matters concerning faith in their own evil desires. Those however who had no doctrine of faith were unable to act in this fashion. For people outside of the Church have no 
knowledge of truth and good, and those who do not have that knowledge can have a type of innocence even when they say or do something that is contrary to the truths and goods of faith. For they can 
be inspired with zeal for the system of worship which they have been brought up in since early childhood, and which they therefore suppose to be true and good. But in the case of people who do possess 
a doctrine of faith the matter is altogether different, for they are capable of mixing truths with falsities, and sacred things with profane. For this reason their lot in the next life is far worse than 
that of those called gentiles, who in the Lord's Divine mercy will be considered later on.

</p><b>593.</b>
'Quem creavi desuper faciebus humi': quod significet hominem a posteritate Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, constat non solum ex eo quod dicatur 'homo quem creavit,' quod est quem regeneravit; et postea, 'quem 
fecit,' quod est quem perfecit seu regeneravit usque ut factus caelestis: tum quoque ex eo quod dicatur 'desuper faciebus humi'; 'humus' est ubi Ecclesia, ut prius ostensum est; etiam exinde quod 
de illis agatur qui doctrinalia fidei immerserunt cupiditatibus suis; qui non habuerunt doctrinam fidei, non potuerunt ita facere; qui extra Ecclesiam, in ignorantia veri et boni sunt: qui in ignorantia, 
possunt esse in quadam specie innocentiae dum aliquid contra vera et bona fidei loquuntur et agunt, nam zelo quodam agi possunt pro eo cultu quo ab infantia imbuti, quem ideo putant verum et bonum; 
at cum iis qui doctrinam fidei apud se habent, alia prorsus res est; ii commiscere possunt vera falsis, et sancta profanis; inde sors eorum in altera vita multo pejor est sorte illorum qui gentes vocantur, 
de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
