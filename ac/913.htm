<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>913.</strong>“叫它们分散到地上”表内在人的行为进入外在人，而“结果”表良善的增多，“繁殖”表真理的增多，“在地上”表在外在人中。这一点从事物间的联系，以及前面有关“结果”的含义的阐述和说明清楚可知。在圣言中，“结果”与良善相关，“繁殖”与真理相关。“地”表外在人，这在前面同样予以说明，故无需赘述。此处论述的是人重生之后，内在人的行为进入外在人。也就是说，当良善开始“结果”，真理开始“繁殖”时，外在人变得对应或顺从。在此之前，这是不可能的，因为身体的情欲与良善格格不入，感官的错觉与真理格格不入。前者毁灭对良善的热爱，后者毁灭对真理的热爱。良善的结果和真理的繁殖在外在人中进行：良善的结果在其情感中进行，真理的繁殖在其记忆中进行。外在人在此被称为“地”，它们分散在“地”上，并结果和繁殖。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]913.</strong> And let them swarm throughout the earth symbolizes the way the inner self acts on the outer, let them reproduce symbolizes increases in goodness, let them multiply symbolizes increases in truth, and on the earth means in the outer self. All this can be seen from the general line of reasoning. It can also be seen from earlier remarks and illustrations [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_43" target=_top>43</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55" target=_top>55</a>] concerning the symbolism of reproducing and multiplying, showing that the Word uses the former in connection with good and the latter in connection with truth. The symbolism of the earth as the outer self was likewise demonstrated earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>]. Consequently there is no need to spend time proving these things.<br />The present verse speaks of the way the inner self acts on the outer after we have regenerated, revealing that good first reproduces itself and truth first multiplies when the outer self is reduced into correspondence or obedience. It can never happen before that, because bodily desires rebel against goodness, and sense impressions rebel against truth. The former snuff out love for goodness, and the latter extinguish love for truth.<br />Good reproduces and truth multiplies in the outer self — good reproducing itself in our feelings, and truth multiplying in our memory. The outer self throughout which good and truth swarm and on which they reproduce and multiply is here called the earth. </p>

That they may spread themselves over the earth. That this signifies the operation of the internal man on the external, and that "being fruitful" signifies increasings of good, "multiplying" increasings 
of truth, and "upon the earth" in the external man, is evident from the connection of the things, and also from what has been before said and shown about the signification of "being fruitful" which 
in the Word is predicated of goods, and about that of "multiplying" which is predicated of truths. That "earth" signifies the external man has likewise been shown before; so that we need not dwell longer 
on these significations in order to confirm them. Here the subject is the operation of the internal man on the external after the man has been regenerated, showing that good is for the first time 
made fruitful, and truth multiplied, when the external man has been reduced to correspondence or obedience. This can never be so before, because what is corporeal opposes what is good, and what is sensuous 
opposes what is true, the one extinguishing the love of good, and the other extinguishing the love of truth. The fructification of good and the multiplication of truth take place in the external 
man; the fructification of good in his affections, and the multiplication of truth in his memory. The external man is here called "the earth" over which they spread themselves, and upon which they become 
fruitful and multiply. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 913</b></p><p><b>913.</b>
'Let them spread out into the earth' means the action of the internal man into the external, while 'be fruitful' means increases in good, 'and multiply' increases in truth, and 'over the earth' means 
with the external man. This is clear from the train of thought and also from what has been stated and shown already about the meaning in the Word of 'being fruitful' as having reference to goods, and 
of 'multiplying' to truths. That 'the earth' means the external man has in like manner been shown already, so there is no need to pause and confirm these points. Here the subject is the action of the 
internal man into the external after a person has been regenerated. That is to say, when good starts 'to be fruitful' and truth 'to multiply', the external man is rendered correspondent or obedient. 
Until then this is not possible because the desires of the body are incompatible with goods, and the illusions of the senses with truths. The former annihilate the love of good, the latter the love of 
truth. The fruitfulness of good and the multiplication of truth take place in the external man - the fruitfulness of good in his affections, the multiplication of truth in his memory. The external man 
is here called 'the earth' into which mankind spreads out and over which they are fruitful and multiply.  </p>

Quod 'diffundant se in terra, significent operationem interni hominis in externum, et quod 'fructificent' significent incrementa boni, et 'multiplicentur' incrementa veri, et quod 'super terra' significet 
apud externum hominem, constat a serie rerum, tum ab ii quae prius dicta et ostensa sunt de significatione 'fructificare' quod in Verbo praedicetur de bonis, et de significatione 'multiplicari' 
quod praedicetur de veris: quod 'terra' significet externum hominem similiter prius ostensum est; quare non illis confirmandis immorandum.  Hic agitur de interni hominis operatione in externum postquam 
homo regeneratus est, quod nempe tunc primum 'fructificetur' bonum et 'multiplicetur' verum cum externus homo redactus est in correspondentiam aut oboedientiam; prius nusquam potest, quia repugnant 
bonis corporea et veris sensualia; illa amorem boni, haec amorem veri exstinguunt: fructificatio boni, et multiplicatio veri fit in externo homine; fructificatio boni in ejus affectionibus, multiplicatio 
veri in ejus memoria. Externus homo hic vocatur 'terra,' in quam {1} se diffundunt, et super qua se fructificant et multiplicant. </p>
