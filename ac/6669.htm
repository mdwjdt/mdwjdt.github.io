<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6669节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6669.</strong>“无论是和泥，是做砖”表通过他们所设计的邪恶和所捏造的虚假。这从“泥”和“砖”的含义清楚可知：“泥”是指良善，在反面意义上是指邪恶，如下文所述；“砖”是指他们所捏造的虚假（参看<a href="1296.htm">1296</a>节）。关于地狱里的人所设计和捏造的邪恶和虚假，可参看前文（<a href="6666.htm">6666</a>节）。“泥”表示虚假所来自的邪恶，这一点从以下圣言经文明显看出来：<br />恶人好像翻腾的海不得平静；其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.20.htm">57:20</a>）<br />“污秽”表示邪恶所来自的虚假；“淤泥”表示虚假所来自的邪恶。<br />耶利米书：<br />你的脚陷入淤泥中，他们反而退后。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶38.22.htm">38:22</a>）<br />“脚陷入淤泥中”表示属世层陷入邪恶中。那鸿书：<br />你要打水预备受困，要坚固你的保障，踹土踩泥，修补砖窑。在那里火必烧灭你，剑必剪灭你。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“踩泥”表示出于邪恶思想虚假。哈巴谷书：<br />他必说，那增添不属自己之物的有祸了！要到几时呢？那用厚泥涂抹自己的！咬伤你的岂不忽然起来？（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.6.htm">2:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“用厚泥涂抹自己”表示用邪恶。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华把我从毁灭坑里、从淤泥中拉出来，使我的脚立在磐石上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.2.htm">40:2</a>）<br />我陷在深淤泥中，没有站立之地；我到了深水中，波涛漫过我身。求你搭救我出离淤泥，不叫我沉下去，使我出离深水；不容深渊吞灭我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.2.htm">69:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“淤泥”表示虚假所来自的邪恶。以赛亚书：<br />掌权的好像灰泥临到，仿佛窑匠踹泥一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.25.htm">41:25</a>）<br />然而，在以下经文，“泥”表示良善：<br />耶和华啊，现在你仍是我们的父！我们是泥，你是窑匠，我们都是你手的工作。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.8.htm">64:8</a>）<br />“泥”表示正在形成的教会成员，因而表示人得以形成，也就是得以改造所凭借的信之良善。<br />在耶利米书也一样：<br />耶和华的话临到耶利米说：你起来，下到窑匠的家里去，我在那里要使你听我的话。我就下到窑匠的家里去，见他正在转轮上作工；但他正在做的器皿坏了，好像窑匠手中的泥；他就回头用这泥作别的器皿，照窑匠的手做它的样子。于是耶和华的话就临到我说，耶和华说，以色列家啊，我待你们，岂不能像这窑匠一样吗？看哪，以色列家啊，泥在窑匠的手中怎样，你们在我的手中也怎样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.1.htm">18:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“以色列家”表示将要形成的教会；由于这种形成通过仁之良善和信之真理实现，并且这些良善和真理由“泥”和“窑匠的器皿”来表示，所以先知被吩咐去到窑匠的家；如果“泥”和“窑匠的器皿”没有这些含义，这一切不会发生。<br />在以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.15.htm">29:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.9.htm">45:9</a>）和约伯记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯10.9.htm">10:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯33.6.htm">33:6</a>），耶和华或主被称为“窑匠”，正在被改造的人被称为“泥”。主用用唾沫和泥抹在生来瞎眼的人的眼睛上，叫他往西罗亚池子里去洗，于是瞎子就看见了（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.6.htm">9:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.11.htm">11</a>）；这种事之所以发生，是因为它代表了生来没有真理的任何知识之人的改造；这种改造通过“泥”所表示的信之良善实现。</p>

In clay, and in bricks. That this signifies by reason of the evils which they contrived, and the falsities which they devised, is evident from the signification of "clay," as being good, and in the opposite 
sense evil (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "bricks," as being the falsities which they devise (see n. 1296; concerning the evils and falsities which the infernals contrive 
and devise, see just above, n. 6666). That "clay" denotes evil from which is falsity, is plain from the following passages in the Word: </p>
<p>     The wicked are like the driven sea, when it cannot rest; 
its waters cast up mire and clay (Isa. 57:20); </p>
<p>"mire" denotes falsity from which is evil; and "clay," evil from which is falsity. [2] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thy feet are sunk in the clay, they have 
gone backward (Jer. 38:22); </p>
<p>"the feet sunk in the clay" denotes the natural sunk in evil.      Draw thee waters for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses; enter into the mire, and tread the clay, repair 
the brick-kiln; there shall the fire devour thee, and the sword shall cut thee off (Nah. 3:14-15); </p>
<p>"to tread the clay" denotes to think from evil what is false.      He shall say, Woe to him that 
multiplieth what is not his! How long? And to him that ladeth himself with clay! Shall they not rise up suddenly that bite thee? (Hab. 2:6-7); </p>
<p>"to lade himself with clay" denotes with evil. [3] In 
David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath made me to come out of the pit of devastation, out of the mire of clay, and He hath set my feet upon a rock (Ps. 40:2).      I sank in deep clay where there is no standing. 
I am come into depths of waters, and the wave overwhelmed me; rescue me out of the clay, lest I be submerged, and out of the depths of waters; and let not the deep swallow me up (Ps. 69:2, 14-15); </p>
<p>"clay" 
denotes evil, from which is falsity. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The rulers shall come as clay, and as the potter treadeth the mire (Isa. 41:25). [4] "Clay," however, denotes good in the following passages: </p>
<p> 
    Now, Jehovah, Thou art our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our potter; and we all are the work of Thy hand (Isa. 64:8); </p>
<p>"clay" denotes the man of the church who is being formed, thus the 
good of faith by means of which man is formed, that is, reformed. [5] So in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said to Jeremiah, Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will make thee to hear My words. 
I went down therefore into the potter's house, and behold he wrought his work upon the board; but the vessel he was making was spoiled, as clay in the hand of the potter; and he turned back and 
made it another vessel, as was right in the hand of the potter to make it. Then was the word of Jehovah effected unto me, saying, Cannot I do with you, O house of Israel, as this potter? saith Jehovah. 
Behold, as the clay in the hand of the potter, so are ye in My hand, O house of Israel (Jer. 18:1-6); </p>
<p>the "house of Israel" denotes the church which was to be formed; and as the formation is done by 
means of the good of charity and the truth of faith, and these are signified by "clay" and the "potter's vessel," therefore the prophet was ordered to go into the potter's house, which would not have 
been done unless these things had been signified by "clay" and the "potter's vessel." [6] Jehovah, or the Lord, is called a "potter," and the man who is being reformed is called "clay," namely, in 
Isa. 29:15, 16; 45:9; Job 10:9; 33:6. That the Lord made clay with spittle, and anointed the eyes of the man born blind, and commanded him to wash in the pool of Siloam, and that thereupon he that was 
blind was made to see (John 9:6, 7, 11), was done because there was represented the reformation of a man who has been born in ignorance of truth, and that reformation is made through the good of faith, 
which is the "clay." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6669</b></p><p><b>6669.</b>
'In clay and in bricks' means on account of the evils which they devised and the falsities which they fabricated. This is clear from the meaning of 'clay' as good, and in the contrary sense as evil, 
dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'bricks' as falsities that people fabricate, dealt with in <a href="1296.htm">1296</a>. As regards the evils and falsities which those in hell devise and fabricate, see just above in <a href="6666.htm">6666</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that 'clay' means evil from which falsity is produced is evident from the following places in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest; its 
waters throw out mud and clay. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57:20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Mud' stands for falsity from which evil is derived, and 'clay' for evil from which falsity is produced. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Jeremiah, Your feet have sunk into the 
clay, [your close friends] have turned away backwards. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2038:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 38:22</a>. </p>
<p>'Feet sunk into the clay' stands for the natural sunken in evil. In Nahum, </p>
<blockquote>
Draw yourself water for the siege, strengthen your 
fortifications; go into the mud and tread the clay; renew the brick-kiln. There the fire will devour you, and the sword cut you off. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum%203:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Nahum 3:14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Treading the clay' stands for being prompted 
by evil to think what is false. In Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
He will say, Woe to him who multiplies what is not his how long? And to him who loads clay onto himself Will there not rise up suddenly those who will bite 
you? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%202:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 2:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Loading clay onto himself' stands for taking up evil.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah caused me to come up out of the pit of devastation, out of the muddy clay, and He set my feet 
upon a rock. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2049:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 49:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
I sank in deep clay, and there was no standing; I came into the depths of the waters, and a wave overwhelmed me. Snatch me out of the clay lest I sink, 
and out of the depths of the waters; and do not let the depth swallow me up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:2,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:2, 14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Clay' stands for evil from which falsity is produced. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He will come against prelates 
as though against clay, as a potter treads mud.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But in the following places 'clay' stands for good: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Now, O Jehovah, You are our Father, we are the clay, and You are 
our potter; and we are all the work of Your hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2064:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 64:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The clay' stands for the member of the Church who is being formed, thus for the good of faith by means of which that person is formed, 
that is, reformed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Similarly in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Jeremiah, Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words. I went down therefore to the potter's 
house, and behold, he made a work on the table. But the vessel that he was making was marred, like clay in the potter's hand. And he returned and made it into another vessel, as was right in the eyes 
of the potter to make it. Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Like this potter can I not do to you, O house of Israel? Said Jehovah. Behold, like the clay in the hand of the potter, so are 
you in My hand, O house of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2018:1-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 18:1-6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The house of Israel' stands for the Church that is to be formed. And it is because the good of charity and the truth of faith are used in the forming 
of it, and because such good and truth are meant by 'the clay' and 'the potter's vessel', that the prophet was commanded to go to the potter's  house. This would not have happened if 'the clay' and 
'the potter's vessel' had not had those meanings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 There are other places too in which Jehovah or the Lord is called 'the potter' and the person who is being reformed 'the clay', namely Isa. 
29:15, <a href="16.htm">16</a>; 45:9; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2010:9;%2033:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 10:9; 33:6</a> The incident in which the Lord made clay with His saliva and anointed the eyes of the man born blind and then commanded him to wash in the pool of Siloam, with the result 
that the blind man was made to see, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:6,%207,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:6, 7, 11</a>, took place because it represented the reformation of man, who is born without any knowledge of truth. And that reformation is effected by means 
of the good of faith, meant by 'the clay'.

</p><b>6669.</b>
`In luto et in lateribus': quod significet propter mala quae invenerunt, et falsa quae finxerunt, constat ex significatione `luti' quod sit bonum, et in opposito sensu malum {1}, de qua sequitur; et 
ex significatione `laterum' quod sint falsa quae fingunt, de qua n. 1296; de malis et falsis quae infernales inveniunt et fingunt, videatur mox supra n. 6666.  Quod `lutum' sit malum ex quo falsum, patet 
ab his locis in Verbo: apud Esaiam,  Impii sicut mare impulsum, quando quiescere non potest, ejiciunt aquae ejus caenum et lutum, lvii 20; </p>
<p>`caenum' pro falso ex quo malum, et `lutum' pro malo ex 
quo falsum: apud Jeremiam, 2 Immersi sunt in lutum pedes tui, recesserunt retrorsum, xxxviii 22; </p>
<p>`immersi in lutum pedes' pro quod naturale in malum: apud Nahum, Aquas obsidii hauri tibi, confirma 
munimenta tua; intra in caenum, et calca lutum, repara fornacem latericiam, ibi comedet te ignis, et exscindet te gladius, iii 14, 15; </p>
<p>`calcare lutum' pro {2}ex malo cogitare falsum: apud Habakuk, Dicet, 
Vae multiplicanti non suum, quousque? et oneranti super se lutum, nonne subito surgent mordentes te? ii 6, 7; </p>
<p>`onerare super se lutum' pro malum: apud Davidem, 3 Jehovah fecit ascendere me e 
fovea devastationis, e caeno luti, et constituit super petra pedes meos, Ps. xl 3 [A. V. 2]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Submersus sum in luto profundo, nec consistens, veni in profunditates aquarum, et fluctus obruit 
me: eripe me e luto ne submergar, et e profunditatibus aquarum, et ne absorbeat me profunditas, Ps. lxix 3, [15,] 16 [A.V. 2, 14, 15]; </p>
<p>`lutum' pro malo ex quo falsum: apud Esaiam, 4 Venient antistites 
sicut lutum, et sicut figulus calcat caenum, xli 25 {3}: </p>
<p>`lutum' autem pro bono in his locis: apud Esaiam, Nunc Jehovah Pater noster Tu, nos lutum, et Tu figulus noster, et opus manus Tuae 
omnes nos, lxiv 7 (A. V. 8]; </p>
<p>`lutum' pro homine Ecclesiae qui formatur, ita pro bono fidei per 5 quod homo formatur, hoc est, reformatur {4}: similiter apud Jeremiam, Dixit Jehovah ad Jeremiam, Surge 
et descende domum figuli, et ibi audire faciam te verba Mea.  Descendi itaque in domum figuli, cum ecce ille fecit opus super tabula, sed corruptum est vas quod ille faciens, sicut lutum in manu figuli; 
et reversus est, et fecit illud vas aliud, quemadmodum rectum fuit, in (x)oculis figuli facere.  Tunc factum est verbum Jehovae ad me, dicendo, Num sicut figulus hic non possum facere vobis, domus 
Israelis? dictum Jehovae: Ecce quemadmodum lutum in manu figuli, sic vos in manu Mea, domus Israelis, xviii 1-6; </p>
<p>`domus Israelis' pro Ecclesia quae formanda, et quia formatio fit per bonum charitatis 
et verum fidei, et illa significantur per `lutum' et `vas figuli,' ideo propheta jussus est ire {5}in domum figuli; quod {6} non factum nisi per `lutum' et per `vas figuli' illa significata fuerint. 	6 
Alibi etiam Jehovah seu Dominus vocatur `figulus,' et, homo qui reformatur `lutum', nempe Esai. xxix 15, 16, xlv 9; Hiob x 9, xxxiii 6. Quod Dominus fecerit lutum ex sputo, et inunxerit super oculos 
caeci nati, et jusserit ut lavaret se in lacu Siloam, et quod inde caecus factus videns, Joh. ix 6, 7, 11, factum erat quia repraesentabatur reformatio hominis qui in ignorantia veri natus est, 
et quod reformatio fiat per bonum fidei quod est `lutum.' 	@1 i quod invenirent$ 	@2 invenire malum$ 	@3 i, similiter$ 	@4 i et regeneratur$ 	@5 ad$ 	@6 i alioquin$ </p>
