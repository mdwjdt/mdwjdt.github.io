<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>917.</strong>“各从其类”表成双成对。这一点从前面所述明显可知，即“凡洁净的每样七对”和“凡不洁净的每样一对”进入方舟（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.2.htm">7:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.15.htm">15</a>），而此处经上说“它们各从其类出了方舟”。其原因在于，现在主已将一切事物导入秩序，以便它们能代表家族。对重生之人而言，良善和真理，即仁之物和信之物皆源于这秩序，它们象血缘和姻亲关系那样相互关联，因而就象从一个祖先或父辈那里传下来的家族一样，它们在天堂就是这样（<a href="685.htm">685</a>节）。具体来说，本节的意思是，一切良善，无论总体还是细节，皆关注自己的真理，仿佛这些真理与其在婚姻中结合。正如仁总体上关注信，同样，良善在每一个细节上关注真理。因为总体若不通过细节存在，就不是总体。总体正是通过细节获得存在，并凭它们而被称为总体。对每个人来说，情况是这样：人总体上如何，其情感和观念的最细微之处就如何。他由这些细节组成，或凭这些细节而变成总体上的样子。所以，人若重生，其最细微之处就会具有其总体上的秉性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]917.</strong> The fact that by their families means pairs can be seen from previous statements about the entry of the clean animals seven by seven and of the unclean animals two by two (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_2-3" target=_top>Genesis 7:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_15" target=_top>15</a>). The current verse, however, says that they went out by families. It says families and not seven at a time or two at a time because at this point the Lord has brought all elements into such good order that they represent families.<br />In a regenerate person, virtues and truths (or the attributes of charity and so the attributes of faith) relate to each other in such a way that they all regard each other as blood relatives and kin. That is to say, they regard each other as belonging to families that spring from the same stock or the same progenitor. The situation resembles that in heaven (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_685" target=_top>685</a>). This is how the Lord organizes our positive qualities and true ideas.<br />The specific meaning here is that each and every form of good looks at its related truth as being united in marriage with itself. The way charity in general views faith is the same way that a single good impulse in particular always views a single truth.<br />A general rule is not general unless it emerges from specific cases. It is from the specific cases that the general rule has its existence and from them that it is described as general. The situation is the same in each of us; whatever we are like generally, we are like in every smallest detail of our feelings and thoughts. These form our constituent parts; these make us what we are as a whole. So when people have been reborn, they become the same in the most minute respects as they are overall.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The idea that the human being serves as both a microcosm and a macrocosm is extremely important in Swedenborg's thought. Most commonly he describes a larger collective as resembling an individual: that is, heaven takes the form of the universal human (see notes 5 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_0" target=_top>0</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a> in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_318" target=_top>318</a>, and 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_637" target=_top>637:1</a>), and even humanity on earth resembles the human form. Here, by contrast, the individual is taken as a macrocosm: each of her or his smallest parts reflects the whole, in a manner that a modern person might describe as holographic. [RS] </p>

According to their families. That this signifies pairs, is evident from what was said before, namely, that there entered into the ark "of the clean by sevens" and "of the unclean by twos" (Gen. 7:2, 
3, 15); while here it is said that they went out of it "according to their families" the reason of which is that all things had now been so reduced into order by the Lord that they could represent families. 
In the regenerated man, goods and truths, or the things of charity and faith, are related to each other as with relationships by blood and by marriage, thus as families from one stock or parent, 
in like manner as they are in heaven (n. 685), an order into which goods and truths are brought by the Lord. Specifically, it is here signified that all goods both in general and in particular have 
regard to their own truths, as though these were conjoined with them in marriage; and just as in general charity regards faith, so in every particular good regards truth; for the general, unless it exists 
from the particular, is not the general, seeing that it is from the particulars that the general has its existence, and from them is called general. So in every man, such as is the man in general, 
such is he in the minutest particulars of his affection and of his idea. Of these he is composed, or of these he becomes such as he is in general; and therefore they who have been regenerated become 
such in the smallest particulars as they are in general. </p>

'According to their families' means pairs. This is clear from what has been stated already in Chapter 7:2, <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>, about them going into the ark 'seven by seven of the clean, and two by two of the unclean', 
whereas in the present verse it is said that they went out 'according to families'. The reason no reference is made to seven by seven of the clean and two by two of the unclean but to 'families' 
is that the Lord has now brought all things into such order that they represent families. With a regenerate person goods and truths, that is, the things of charity and those of faith deriving from it, 
interrelate like blood relatives and relatives through marriage, and so they are like families descended from a single stock or parent, in the way they are in heaven, <a href="685.htm">685</a>. This is the order which the 
Lord brings to goods and truths. The express meaning in the present verse is that every single good looks upon its own truth as one joined to it in marriage. And just as in general charity looks to 
faith, so in every individual part good looks to truth. For unless the general whole is the product of the individual part there is no general whole. It is from the individual parts that the general 
comes into being, and it is by virtue of that that it is called the general. With every person the situation is as follows: As is the person in general so are the most individual details of his affections 
and ideas. These are what he is composed of or what make him what he is in general. People therefore who have been regenerated become in the most individual details of their person what they are 
in general character. </p>

Quod 'secundum familias suas' significent paria, constat ex illis quae prius dicta sunt, nempe quod 'septena et septena ex mundis et bina et bina ex immundis intraverint' cap. praec. vii vers. 2, 3, 
15; hic autem quod 'secundum familias' exiverint: quod non septena et septena, bina et bina dicantur, sed familiae, causa est quia omnia nunc in ordinem a Domino ita redacta sunt ut repraesentent familias; 
apud hominem regeneratum se ita habent bona et vera, seu illa quae sunt charitatis et inde fidei, quod se mutuo spectent sicut consanguinitates et affinitates, ita sicut familiae ex una stirpe 
seu parente, similiter ac se habent in caelo, n. 685, qui est ordo qui bonis et veris inducitur a Domino: in specie hic significatur quod omnia et singula bona spectent sua vera, sicut conjugio conjuncta; 
et sicut in communi charitas fidem, ita in omni particulari bonum verum; nam commune nisi existat a particulari, non est commune; a particularibus habet commune suam existentiam, et ex illis vocatur 
commune; in unoquovis homine ita se res habet: qualis homo in communi est, talis est in singularissimis suae affectionis et suae ideae; ex his componitur aut ex his fit talis in communi: quare qui 
regenerati sunt, tales fiunt in singularissimis quales sunt in communi. </p>
