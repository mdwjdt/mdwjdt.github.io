<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6769节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6769.</strong>“摩西便惧怕，说，这事必是被人知道了”表他在疏远的记忆知识当中，在真理上尚未强壮到安全无虞的程度。这从“惧怕”的含义清楚可知，“惧怕”是指安全无虞，因为当人感觉不安全时，他就会感到惧怕。他不安全，是因为他在真理上不强壮；事实上，凡在真理上强壮的人，无论往哪里去，甚至在地狱中间也很安全。在真理上尚不强壮的人之所以不安全，是因为非真理的东西将他们与恶灵联在一起。这些事就由这些话，即“摩西便惧怕，说，这事必是被人知道了”，也就是被他在其中的埃及人知道了来表示，这一点也可从接下来的经文明显看出来，即：“法老听见这事，就设法要杀摩西”。</p>

And Moses feared, and said, Surely the word is known. That this signifies that he was among alienated memory-knowledges, and not yet in truths so as to be safe, is evident from the signification of "fearing," 
as being not to be in safety, for then there is fear. That he is not in safety is because he is not in truths; for they who are in truths are in safety wherever they go, even in the midst of 
the hells. That they who are not yet in truths are not in safety is because things not true communicate with evil spirits. These things are signified by the words, "Moses feared, and said, Surely the 
word is known," that is, to the Egyptians among whom he was, as is also evident from what presently follows-that "Pharaoh heard this word and sought to kill Moses." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6769</b></p><p><b>6769.</b>
'And Moses was afraid, and said, Surely the matter is known!' means that he was among alienated factual knowledge and not yet so strong in truths as to be safe from harm. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'being afraid' as not being safe from harm; for when a person feels unsafe he feels afraid. He is unsafe because he is not strong in truths; for people who are strong in truths are kept safe from 
harm wherever they go, even if they are in the midst of hell. The reason why people who are not yet strong in truths are not safe from harm is that untruths link them up with evil spirits. These considerations 
are meant by the words, 'Moses was afraid, and said, Surely the matter is known', that is, known to the Egyptians whom he was among; and they are also evident from what immediately follows, 
where it says that when Pharaoh heard of this matter he sought to kill Moses. </p>

`Et timuit Moscheh, et dixit, Certe notum est verbum': quod significet quod inter scientifica abalienata esset, et nondum in veris, ut tutus, constat ex significatione `timere' quod sit non esse in 
tuto, tunc enim timor;{1} quod non in tuto, est quia non in veris; nam qui in veris sunt, illi in tuto sunt ubicumque vadunt, etiam si in mediis infernis; {2}quod qui nondum in veris, non in tuto {3}sint, 
causa est quia non vera communicant cum spiritibus malis {4}; haec significantur per illa verba, quod `timuit Moscheh, et dixit, Certe notum est verbum,' nempe Aegyptiis, inter quos erat; ut quoque 
patet a mox sequentibus, quod `audiverit Pharao verbum hoc, et quaesiverit occidere Moschen.' 	@1 i causa$ 	@2 at$ 	@3 sunt, nam non vera seu falsa$ 	@4 i et conjungunt$ </p>
