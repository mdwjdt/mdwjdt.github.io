THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-7. And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have given thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee, and Aaron 
thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, and let him send the sons of Israel out of his land. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh 
will not hear you; and I will give My hand upon the Egyptians, and lead forth My armies, My people, the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments. And the Egyptians shall know that 
I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth My hand upon the Egyptians, and lead forth the sons of Israel from the midst of them. And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they. And Moses 
was a son of eighty years, and Aaron a son of three and eighty years, when they spoke unto Pharaoh. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "See, I have given thee a god to Pharaoh," signifies 
the law Divine and its power over those who are in falsities; "and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet," signifies the doctrine thence derived; "thou shalt speak all that I command thee," 
signifies reception of the influx of the Divine, and communication; "and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh," signifies the reception of the influx thence, and its communication with those who 
are in falsities; "and let him send the sons of Israel out of his land," signifies that they should desist from infestation; "and I will harden Pharaoh's heart," signifies obstinacy from the evil of 
falsity; "and multiply My signs and My wonders," signifies warnings of every kind, nor shall anything be wanting; "in the land of Egypt," signifies where are they who infest; "and Pharaoh will not hear 
you," signifies that they who are in falsities will not receive; "and I will give My hand upon the Egyptians," signifies that therefore they shall be driven by the Divine power; "and lead forth My armies, 
My people, the sons of Israel," signifies that they would be liberated who are in goods and truths; "out of the land of Egypt," signifies from infestations; "with great judgments," signifies according 
to the laws of order; "and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah," signifies that they shall be in fear of the Divine; "when I stretch forth My hand upon the Egyptians," signifies when they 
observe the Divine power in themselves; "and lead forth the sons of Israel from the midst of them," signifies and when they shall see those liberated who are of the spiritual church; "and Moses and 
Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they," signifies that what things were said were also done; "and Moses was a son of eighty years," signifies the state and quality of the law from the 
Divine; "and Aaron a son of three and eighty years," signifies the state and quality of doctrine; "when they spoke unto Pharaoh," signifies when these things were commanded. </p>

of Israel' means that those among whom forms of good and truths are present are to be delivered. 'Out of the land of Egypt' means from molestations. 'With great judgements' means in accordance with the 
laws of order. 'And may the Egyptians know that I am Jehovah' means that they will have a fear of the Divine. 'When I stretch out My hand over the Egyptians' means when they become aware of the Divine 
power over them. 'And I will lead the children of Israel out of the midst of them' means and when they come to see that those who belong to the spiritual Church are being delivered. 'And Moses and 
Aaron did so; as Jehovah had commanded, so they did' means that the things which had been said were also done. 'And Moses was a son of eighty years' means the state and essential nature of the law from 
God. 'And Aaron a son of eighty-three years' means the state and essential nature of the doctrinal teachings. 'When they spoke to Pharaoh' means when those things were commanded.
