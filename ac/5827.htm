<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5827节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5827.</strong>“一个离开我出去了”表内在良善的看似离开。这从“出去”或离开的含义和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“出去”或离开是指离开；“约瑟”是指内在良善，如前所述。离开只是一种表象，这是显而易见的，因为约瑟仍活着。此中情形是这样：关于约瑟自始至终所记载的细节都依次代表了主之人身的荣耀，因而在较低意义上代表人的重生，因为人的重生是主荣耀的形像或模型（参看<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。<br />就人的重生而言，情况是这样：在第一个状态，就是当人正通过真理被引入良善的时候，真理是显而易见的，因为它存在于尘世之光中，离由身体感官所形成的观念不远。而良善不是这种情况，良善存在于天堂之光中，与由身体感官所形成的观念相距甚远，因为它在人的灵里面。正因如此，信之真理是显而易见的，而良善却不是，即便良善不断存在，并流入真理，给它们带来生命。若非如此，人绝无可能重生。不过，一旦这种状态结束，良善就会显示自己，并且通过对邻之爱和对作为生活指南的真理的情感来显示自己。这些也是约瑟从他父亲那里被带走，他的父亲看不见他，之后他向父亲显示自己所代表的事。这也是要如何理解“一个离开我出去了”所表示的内在良善的看似离开。</p>

And the one went out from me. That this signifies the seeming departure of internal good, is evident from the signification of "going out," or going away, as being departure; and from the representation 
of Joseph as being internal good (of which above). That the departure was seeming only is plain, for Joseph still lived. The case herein is this. By what has been related of Joseph, from beginning 
to end, is represented in its order the glorification of the Lord's Human, and consequently in a lower sense the regeneration of man, for this is an image or type of the Lord's glorification (see n. 
3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688). With the regeneration of man the case is this. In the first state when a man is being introduced through truth into good, the truth appears manifestly, because it 
is in the light of the world, and not far from the sensuous things of the body. But it is not so with good, for this is in the light of heaven, and remote from the sensuous things of the body, for it 
is within in man's spirit. Hence it is that the truth which is of faith appears manifestly, but not good, although this is continually present, and flows in, and makes the truths live. Man could not possibly 
be regenerated in any other way. But when this state has been passed through, then good manifests itself, and this by love to the neighbor, and by the affection of truth for the sake of life. 
These also are the things represented by Joseph's being carried away and not appearing to his father, and by his afterward manifesting himself to him. This also is meant by the seeming departure of internal 
good, which is signified by "the one went out from me." </p>

'And one went out from me' means an apparent departure of internal good. This is clear from the meaning of 'going out' or going away as a departure, and from the representation of 'Joseph' as internal 
good, dealt with already. The fact that the departure was only an apparent one is self-evident, since Joseph was still alive. The implications of this are as follows: From start to finish the details 
recorded regarding Joseph represent in their order the glorification of the Lord's Human They consequently represent in the lower sense a person's regeneration since this is an image or model of the 
Lord's glorification, <a href="3178.htm">3178</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>. </p>
<p></p>

 So far as a person's regeneration is concerned, in the first state, when he is being brought by means of truth into good, truth is plainly 
visible because it exists in the light of the world and is not far removed from the ideas formed by the bodily senses. This is not the case with good, for good exists in the light of heaven, far 
from ideas formed by the bodily senses since it resides inwardly in the person's spirit. Consequently the truth of faith is clearly visible but good is not, even though good is constantly present, both 
flowing into truths and bringing them to life. If that were not so the person could not be regenerated. But once the state is completed, good reveals itself, doing so through love towards the neighbour, 
and through affection for truth as a guide to life. These things also what are represented by Joseph's being taken away from and not seen by his father, and after that revealing himself to his father. 
This is how an apparent departure of internal good, meant by 'one went out from me', is to be understood. </p>

`Et exivit unus a me':  quod significet discessionem apparentem interni boni, constat a significatione `exire' seu abire, quod sit discessio; et a repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit internum bonum, 
de qua prius; quod discessio apparens fuerit, {1}patet, nam Josephus vixit. (s)Cum hoc ita se habet: per illa quae memorantur de Josepho a principio ad finem repraesentatur in suo ordine glorificatio 
Humani Domini; consequenter in sensu inferiore regeneratio hominis, nam haec est imago seu typus {2}glorificationis Domini, n. (x)3138, 3212, (x)3296, 3490, 4402, 5688; [2] cum regeneratione hominis 
ita se habet: quod in primo statu quando homo introducitur per verum in bonum, verum appareat manifeste, quia in lumine mundi est et non procul a sensualibus corporis; bonum autem non ita, hoc enim est 
in lumine caeli, et procul a sensualibus corporis, est enim intus in hominis spiritu; inde est quod verum quod fidei appareat manifeste, non autem bonum, tametsi hoc adest continue et influit et facit 
ut vera vivant; alioquin nusquam regenerari posset homo; at cum hic status peractus est, tunc (t)bonum se manifestat, et hoc per amorem erga proximum, et per affectionem veri propter vitam; haec sunt 
quae quoque repraesentantur per Josephum, quod ablatus sit et non apparuerit patri suo et quod postea ei se manifestaverit; intelligitur etiam hoc per discessionem apparentem interni boni, quae significatur 
per `exivit unus a me'.(s) {3}  @1 quia Josephus vixit, patet$ @2 illius$ @3 A has a line across the page here, below which is an undeleted passage, not used here but forming the end of n.
