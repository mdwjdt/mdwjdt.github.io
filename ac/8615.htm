<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8615节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8615.</strong>“直到日落”表当这种状态，即与内层邪恶所生的虚假争战的状态即将结束时。这从以下事实清楚可知：白天的各个时间段，从日升到日落，再到日升，表示那些在来世的人所经历的状态变化。日落之时表示这种状态的结束，因此，“直到日落”表示当这种状态即将结束时。白天的各个时间段，从日升到日落，表示状态及其变化（参看<a href="5672.htm">5672</a>，<a href="5962.htm">5962</a>，<a href="6110.htm">6110</a>，<a href="8426.htm">8426</a>节）。<br />凡仔细思考的人都能看出，这几节所记载的事含有并未显现在字面上的奥秘，如摩西站在小山上，手里拿着一根杖；当摩西举手时，约书亚就得胜，当摩西垂手时，亚玛力就得胜；他们将一块石头放在他下面，他就坐在上面；亚伦与户珥扶着他的手，一直扶到日落。若非这些事当中的每一件都对应于天上的事，它们根本不可能有助于与亚玛力的争战。对应关系拥有绝对的全部能力，并且如此之大，以致在地上照着对应关系所行的在天上也有力量；因为对应关系来源于神性。<br />那些处于爱与信之良善的人就处于这种对应关系，神性构成与他们同在的一切，因为神性是爱之良善和信之良善的源头。圣言中所记载的一切神迹都是通过对应关系实现的。圣言是以这种方式写成的：其中的一切细节，甚至最小的细节，都对应于天上的事物。因此，圣言拥有神性力量；它将天与地联结起来。因为当圣言在地上被人阅读时，天上的天使就会被包含在内义中的圣洁所打动。这一切的发生是由于圣言中的一切细节所具有的对应关系。</p>

Until the setting of the sun. That this signifies when this state ceased, namely, the state of combat with falsity from interior evil, is evident from the fact that the times of the day, from the rising 
of the sun to its setting, and again to its rising, signify the changes of state which those undergo who are in the other life. The end of this state is signified by the time of the sun's setting, 
and hence by "until the setting of the sun," is signified when this state ceased. (That the times of the day from the rising of the sun to its setting signify states and their changes, see n. 5672, 5962, 
6110, 8426.) [2] Every person who reflects can see that the things which are related in these verses contain arcana which do not appear in the letter-as that Moses stood on a hill, and had a rod 
in his hand; that Joshua conquered when Moses lifted up his hands, and Amalek conquered when Moses let down his hands; that they put a stone under him upon which he sat; and that Aaron and Hur held up 
his hands, and this until the setting of the sun. Unless all and every one of these things had corresponded to things that are in heaven, they could not have contributed anything to the battle with 
Amalek. [3] Correspondences have all power, insomuch that what is done on earth according to correspondences avails in heaven, because correspondences are from the Divine. They who are in the good of 
love and of faith are in correspondence, and the Divine does all things that appertain to them, for from the Divine come the good of love and the good of faith. All the miracles recorded in the Word 
were done by means of correspondences. The Word has been so written that every particular therein, even to the most minute, corresponds to things that are in heaven. Consequently the Word has Divine power; 
and it conjoins heaven with earth, for when the Word is read on earth, the angels in heaven are moved unto the holiness that is in the internal sense. This is effected by means of the correspondences 
of all the several expressions in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8615</b></p><p><b>8615.</b>
'Until the going down of the sun' means when that state was coming to an end, that is to say, the state of conflict with falsity arising from interior evil. This is clear from the consideration that 
the times of day from sunrise to sunset, and again to sunrise, mean the changes of state which those who are in the next life undergo. The end of that state is meant by the time when the sun is going 
down. So it is that 'until the going down of the sun' means when that state was coming to an end. For the meaning of the times of day from sunrise to sunset as states and changes of them, see <a href="5672.htm">5672</a>, <a href="5962.htm">5962</a>, <a href="6110.htm">6110</a>, <a href="8426.htm">8426</a>. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who ponders over them can see that the matters recorded in these verses contain arcana which are not visible in the letter, such as that Moses was going to stand on the hill, 
having the rod in his hand; that Joshua was winning whenever Moses raised up his hands, and Amalek was winning whenever Moses let down his hands; that they put a stone under him, which he sat on, 
and Aaron and Hur supported his hands; and that this continued until the sun was going down. Unless every single one of these matters had corresponded to things in heaven they could not have contributed 
in any way at all to the battle against Amalek. Correspondences have absolute force, so great that what is done on earth in accordance with correspondences has force in heaven; for correspondences 
have their origin in the Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When people are governed by the good of love and faith, such correspondence exists with them. The Divine composes everything residing with them, for the Divine 
is the source of the good of love and the good of faith. All the miracles referred to in the Word were accomplished through correspondences. The Word has been written in such a way that all the details 
there, even the smallest, correspond to things in heaven. Consequently the Word has Divine force; it links together heaven and earth. For when the Word is read on earth the angels in heaven are stirred 
by the holiness contained in the internal sense. This happens because of the correspondences that all the details possess there. </p>

`Usque ad occidere solem': quod significet cum status ille desineret, nempe status pugnae cum falso ex interiore malo, constat ex eo quod tempora diei ab ortu solis ad occasum ejus, et iterum ad ortum, 
significent status mutationes quas subeunt illi qui in altera vita; finis illius status significatur per tempus occasus solis; inde est quod per `usque ad occidere solem' significetur {1}quod status 
ille desineret; quod tempora diei ab ortu solis ad occasum ejus significent status et eorum mutationes, videatur n. 5672, 5962, 6110, 8426. 	2 Quisque qui expendit videre potest quod illa quae in 
his versibus memorantur contineant arcana quae non exstant in littera, sicut quod Moscheh consisteret super colle: haberet baculum in manu sua: quod vinceret Joschua cum Moscheh elevavit manus, et vinceret 
Amalek cum Moscheh submisit manus: quod posuerint lapidem sub illo super quo sedit: quodque Aharon et Chur sustentarent manus: et hoc usque dum occideret sol; nisi omnia et singula haec correspondissent 
cum illis quae in caelo sunt, nusquam potuissent aliquid conferre ad pugnam cum Amaleko; {2}correspondentiae omnem vim habent, usque adeo ut quod fit in terra secundum correspondentias, hoc in 
caelo valeat, nam correspondentiae sunt ex Divino; qui in bono amoris 3 et fidei sunt, illi in correspondentia sunt, {3}et Divinum facit omnia apud illos, ex Divino enim est bonum amoris et bonum fidei; 
omnia miracula de quibus in Verbo, per correspondentias facta sunt; Verbum scriptum est ita ut singula ibi usque ad minutissima correspondeant illis quae in caelo; inde {4} Verbum vim Divinam habet, 
et conjungit caelum cum terra, nam cum legitur Verbum in terra, angeli qui in caelo moventur ad sanctum quod in sensu interno {5}; hoc fit per correspondentias singulorum ibi {6}. 	@1 cum$ 	@2 The 
remainder of this   is written in A immediately after n. 8617$ 	@3 nam$ 	@4 i quoque$ 	@5 i est$ 	@6 i, propter hanc causam datum est Verbum$ </p>
