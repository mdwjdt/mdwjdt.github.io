<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2515节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2515.</strong>“对他说”表由此而来的思维，也就是说，源于这种直觉的思维。这从“说”的含义清楚可知，“说”是指发觉，以及思考，如前所示（<a href="2506.htm">2506</a>节）。由于这里提到思维源于直觉，故最好对思维作以简要说明。思维有来源于直觉的，有来源于良知的，还有来源于无良知的。源于直觉的思维仅存在于属天之人，也就是那些爱主之人身上；这种思维是人所具有的最内层；它也存在于天堂里的属天天使身上，因为他们的思维凭借并通过来自主的直觉而存在；违背直觉进行思考是不可能的。源于良知的思维相对低级，存在于属灵之人，也就是那些在生活和教义方面具有仁与信之善的人身上。而且，对这些人来说，违背良知进行思考是不可能的；因为这将违背主经由良知指示给他们的善与真而思考。<br />然而，源于无良知的思维则存在于那些不允许自己接受善与真的内在指引，只接受恶与假的指引，也就是说，不靠着主，而是靠他们自己引领之人身上。他们以为自己和那些通过良知和直觉思考的人一样进行内在思考，因为他们不知道何为良知，更不知道何为直觉，尽管这两种人的思维之别，犹如地狱与天堂之别那样大。思维缺乏良知的人出于一切恶欲和谬念，因而出于地狱进行思考，他们若以其它方式思考，也是为了名声，出于外在的体面这样想。而通过良知思考的人则出于对善与真的情感，因而出于天堂进行思考。至于主的思维，它超出所有人的理解，因为它直接源于神性。</p>

And said to him. That this signifies thought therefrom, namely, from the perception, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive, and also to think (as shown in n. 2506). As it 
is here said that there was thought from the perception, it may be well to state in a few words how the case is with thought. There are thoughts from perception; thoughts from conscience; and thoughts 
from no conscience. Thoughts from perception exist only with the celestial, that is, with those who are in love to the Lord; such thought is the most internal that exists with man; and it exists with 
the celestial angels in heaven, for it is perception from the Lord by which and from which their thought exists; and to think contrary to perception is impossible. Thoughts from conscience are lower, 
and exist with the spiritual, that is, with those who are in the good of charity and faith as to life and as to doctrine. Moreover with these persons to think contrary to conscience is impossible; 
for this would be to think against the good and truth which are dictated to them from the Lord through conscience. [2] But thoughts from no conscience exist with those who do not suffer themselves to 
be inwardly directed by what is good and true, but only by what is evil and false; that is, not by the Lord, but by themselves. Such persons believe that they inwardly think just as do those who think 
from conscience and perception, for the reason that they do not know what conscience is, still less perception; but the difference is as great as is that between hell and heaven. They who think without 
conscience think from any cupidities and phantasies whatever; thus from hell; and when it seems otherwise, it is from external decorum for the sake of reputation. But they who think from conscience 
think from the affections of good and truth; thus from heaven. But as regards the Lord's thought, it transcended all human understanding, for it was immediately from the Divine. </p>

'And said to him' means thought springing from this, that is to say, from the perception. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perceiving, and also as thinking, dealt with above in <a href="2506.htm">2506</a>. Since 
it is said here that the thought was derived from the perception, let a brief statement be made about thought. There are thoughts that derive from perception, thoughts that derive from conscience, 
and thoughts that derive from no conscience. Thoughts deriving from perception exist with celestial people only, that is, with those who are moved by love to the Lord. Such thought is the most internal 
to exist with man; and it exists with celestial angels in heaven. Perception from the Lord is the means and the source of their thought, and thinking contrary to perception is an impossibility. Thoughts 
deriving from conscience are of a lower order and exist with spiritual people, that is, with those who in life and in doctrine are moved by good that stems from charity and faith. For them as well, 
thinking contrary to conscience is an impossibility, for that would be thinking contrary to the good and truth which the Lord dictates to them by means of conscience. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Thoughts deriving from 
no conscience however exist with people who do not allow themselves to be governed inwardly by good and truth but by evil and falsity, that is, not by the Lord but by themselves. They imagine that they 
think inwardly just as much as those who do so from conscience and perception, the reason being that they do not know what conscience is, still less what perception is, though the difference between 
their thought and that of people thinking from conscience or perception is as great as that between hell and heaven. People whose thought is devoid of conscience think from every evil desire and false 
notion, and so from hell. When they think in any other manner they do so from an outward respectability for the sake of reputation. But people who think from conscience do so from affections for good 
and truth, and so from heaven. As for the Lord's thought however, this surpasses all human understanding, for it sprang directly from the Divine. </p>

</p><b>2515.</b>
`Et dixit ei': quod significet inde cogitationem, nempe ex perceptione, constat `a significatione `dicere' quod sit percipere, tum cogitare, de qua supra n. 2506. Quia hic dicitur quod cogitatio fuerit 
inde, paucis licet dicere quomodo se habet cum cognitione sunt cogitationes ex perceptione, cogitationes ex conscientia, e cogitationes ex nulla conscientia. Cogitationes ex perceptione dantur solum 
apud caelestes, hoc est, apud illos qui in amore in Dominum sunt, estque intima quae datur apud hominem, et est apud angelos caelestes in caelo; perceptio ex Domino est, per quam et ex qua eorum cogitatio; 
contra perceptionem cogitare est impossibile.  Cogitatione ex conscientia sunt inferiores, et dantur apud spirituales, hoc est, apud eos qui in bono charitatis et fidei sunt quoad vitam et quoad 
doctrinam contra conscientiam cogitare iis quoque est impossibile, nam hoc fore contra bonum et veram quod iis a Domino dictatur per conscientiam.  [2] Cogitationes autem ex nulla conscientia sunt 
apud illos qui se intus non regi patiuntur a bono et vero, sed a malo et falso, hoc est, non Domino, sed a semet: hi credunt quod cogitent tantum intra se quantum ii qui ex conscientia et perceptione, 
ex causa quia non sciunt quid conscientia, minus perceptio, sed tanta est differentia, quanta inter infernum et caelum; qui absque conscientia cogitant, ex quibusvis cupiditatibus et phantasiis cogitant, 
ita ab inferno; (m)dum vero aliter, est ex decoro externo propter famam(n); qui vero a conscientia cogitant, ex affectionibus boni et veri cogitant, ita a caelo. Quod autem Domini cogitationem attinet, 
ea transcendit omnem intellectum humanum fuit enim immediate ex Divino. </p>
