<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3310.</strong>“是个田野的人”表源于教义的生活良善。这从“田野”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，经上经常提及“地”（earth）或“陆地”（land）、“土地”（ground）、“田地”或“田野”。当用于好的意义时，“地”或“陆地”（land）表主在天上和地上的国度，因而表教会，也就是祂在地上的国度。“土地”所表相同，只是意义更加严格（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>-<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>节）。“田地”或“田野”也表示相同的事物，只是意义还要更严格（<a href="368.htm">368</a>，<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>节）。由于教会不是凭教义而成为教会，除非这些教义以生活的良善为目的，或也可说，除非这些教义与生活的良善结合，故“田地”或“田野”主要表示良善的生活。不过，为使教会拥有这类良善，取自圣言、被植入在这良善中的教义必须存在。没有教义，生活的良善的确存在，然而还不是教会的良善，因而不是真正属灵的良善，它仅具有成为这类良善的潜能，如没有圣言、因而不知道主的外邦人当中的生活良善就是这种情形。<br />“田地”或“田野”是指信的事物，即教会所具有的属灵真理要被植入其中的生活良善。这一点从主在马太福音中关于撒种的比喻很明显地看出来：<br />有一个撒种的出去撒种。撒的时候，有落在路旁的，飞鸟来吃尽了；有落在泥土不多的石地上，因为泥土不深，很快就长起来；日头出来，就晒焦了，因为没有根，就枯干了；有落在荆棘里的，荆棘长起来，把它们挤住了；又有落在好土里的，就结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。有耳可听的，就应当听！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.3.htm">13:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.9.htm">9</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.3.htm">4:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.9.htm">9</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.5.htm">8:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这段经文描述了田，也就是教会里面的四种地或土。显然，“种”是指主的圣言，因而是指真理，就是所谓的信之真理；而“好土”是指良善，就是所谓的仁之良善，因为接受圣言的，是人里面的良善。“路旁”是指虚假，“石地”是指没有植根于良善的真理，“荆棘”是指邪恶。<br />至于“田野的人”所表示的源于教义的生活良善，情况是这样：那些正在重生的人首先按照教义的指导行善，因为他们凭自己不知道何为善，而是通过关于爱与仁的教义学习行善，由此知道主是谁，邻人是谁，以及何为爱，何为仁，因而何为善。他们若进入这个阶段，就是处于对真理的情感，被称为“田野的人（viri拉丁文，男子）”。此后，一旦重生，他们就不再出于教义行善，而是出于爱与仁行善，因为那时他们处于通过教义所学来的良善本身中，被称为“田野的人（homines拉丁文，男人）”。其中的情形就像有人天生就倾向于奸淫、偷窃和杀人，但从十诫得知这类行为属于地狱，因而而避开它们。在这种状态下，他就受十诫影响，因为他害怕地狱，并且从这些诫命，以及圣言中的许多事他还学到该如何指导自己的生活。在这种情况下，他行善是出于诫命。但当具有良善时，他便开始憎恶以前所倾向的奸淫、偷窃和杀人。在这种状态下，他就不再出于诫命、而是出于他所具有的良善行善。在前一个状态，他通过真理学习良善；在后一个状态，他通过良善教导真理。<br />这也适用于属灵真理，也就是所谓的教义，它们是更为内在的诫命。因为教义是属世人所具有的内在真理，那里的第一类真理是感官真理，第二类真理是记忆知识的真理，内在真理则属于教义。这些教义真理建立在记忆知识真理的基础之上，因为若不通过记忆知识，人无法对它们形成并保持任何想法、观念或概念。而记忆知识的真理则建立在感官真理的基础之上，因为没有感官真理，人就无法拥有记忆知识。这类真理，也就是说，记忆知识和感官的真理，由“擅长打猎的人”来表示；而教义真理则由“田野的人”来表示。这就是这类真理在人里面所具有的彼此相关的秩序，所以人在成年通过感官和记忆知识的真理而拥有教义真理之前，是不能重生的，因为若不藉着源于记忆知识和感官的真理，他就无法确认教义真理。没有什么东西能存在于人的思维中，包括不具有属世或感官观念的信的最深奥秘，尽管人多半不知道这类观念的性质。但在来世，若他愿意，它们的性质就会呈现在他的理解力面前；甚至若愿望强烈，还会在他眼前呈为可见。在来世，无论显得多么令人难以置信，这类事物仍可以呈现在眼前。 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3310</b></p><p><b>3310.</b>
That "a man of the field" signifies the good of life from doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of "field." In the Word frequent mention is made of "earth" or "land," of "ground," and of 
"field;" and by "earth" or "land," when used in a good sense, is signified the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth, thus the church, which is His kingdom on earth. The like is signified by "ground," 
but in a more restricted sense (n. 566, 662, 1066-1068, 1262, 1413, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928). The same is signified also by "field," but in a sense still more restricted (n. 368, 2971); and 
as the church is not the church from doctrinal things except insofar as these have respect to the good of life as their end; or what is the same, unless these doctrinal things are conjoined with the 
good of life, therefore by "field" is principally signified the good of life; and in order that this may be of the church, there must be doctrinal things from the Word which have been implanted in this 
good. Without doctrinal things there is indeed good of life, but not as yet the good of the church, thus not as yet good truly spiritual, except only in the capacity of becoming so; as is the case 
with the good of life among the Gentiles who have not the Word, and therefore are ignorant of the Lord. [2] That a "field" is the good of life in which are to be implanted the things which are of faith, 
that is, spiritual truths which are of the church, is very evident from the Lord's parable in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The sower went forth to sow, and as he sowed, some fell upon the hard way, and the birds 
came and devoured them; and others fell upon stony places where they had not much earth, and straightway they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun was risen, they were 
scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away; and others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them; but others fell upon the good ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, 
some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold: he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear (Matt. 13:3-9; Mark 4:3-9; Luke 8:5-8). Here four kinds of earth or ground in a field-that is, in the church-are treated 
of. That the "seed" is the Word of the Lord, thus truth, which is said to be of faith, and that the "good ground" is the good which is of charity, is evident, for it is the good in man that receives 
the Word; the "hard way" is falsity; a "stony place" is truth that has no root in good; "thorns" are evils.  [3] As regards the good of life from doctrinal things, which is signified by "a man of 
the field," the case is this: They who are being regenerated, at first do what is good from doctrinal things, for of themselves they do not know what is good, but learn it from the doctrinal things of 
love and charity; from these they know who the Lord is; who is the neighbor; what love is, and what charity; thus what good is. When they are in this state they are in the affection of truth, and are 
called "men [viri] of the field;" but afterwards when they have been regenerated, they do not do what is good from doctrinal things, but from love and charity, for they are then in the good itself which 
they have learned through doctrinal things, and then are called "men [homines] of the field." The case herein is as with one who by nature inclines to adulteries, thefts, and murders, but who learns 
from the commandments of the Decalogue that such things are of hell, and so abstains from them. In this state he is affected by the commandments because he is afraid of hell, and from these and likewise 
from many things in the Word he learns how he ought to direct his life; and in this case when he does what is good, he does it from the commandments. But when he is in good, he begins to be averse 
to the adulteries, thefts, and murders to which before he had been inclined; and when he is in this state, he no longer does what is good from the commandments, but from good, which then is in him. 
In the former state he learns good from truth; in the latter state he teaches truth from good. [4] The same is the case also with spiritual truths, which are called doctrinal things, and are still more 
interior commandments; for doctrinal things are the interior truths that belong to the natural man. The first truths are of sense, the next are of memory-knowledge, the interior ones are of doctrine. 
These doctrinal truths are founded upon truths of memory-knowledge, for man can form and retain no idea, notion, or conception of them except from memory-knowledges. But truths of memory-knowledge 
are founded upon truths of the senses, for without sensuous things no memory-knowledges can be comprehended by man. These truths, namely, those of memory-knowledge and of sense, are what are signified 
by "a man skillful in hunting;" but doctrinal truths are those which are signified by a "man of the field." In this way do these truths follow in succession with man; and therefore until he is of adult 
age, and through truths of sense and of memory-knowledge is in doctrinal truths, no man is able to be regenerated, for he cannot be confirmed in the truths of doctrine, except by means of ideas derived 
from the things of memory-knowledge and of sense. For nothing is possible in man's thought, even as to the deepest arcanum of faith, that is not attended with a natural and sensuous idea, although 
the man is for the most part ignorant of the nature of it; but in the other life, if he desires it, it is presented to view before his understanding, and even, if he so wishes, before his sight; for 
however incredible it may appear, in the other life such things can be presented to the sight. </p>

'A man of the field' means the good of life that has its origin in matters of doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'the field'. In the Word reference is made in many places to the earth (or the 
land), the ground, and the field. When used in a good sense 'the earth' means the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, and so the Church, which is the Lord's kingdom on earth. 'The ground' is used 
in a similar though more limited sense, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>-<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>; and the same things are also meant by 'the field', though in a more limited sense still, <a href="368.htm">368</a>, <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>. And since the Church is not the Church by virtue of matters of doctrine except insofar as these have the good of life as the end in view, or what amounts to the same, unless matters of doctrine 
are joined to the good of life, 'the field' therefore means primarily the good of life. But in order that such good may be that of the Church, matters of doctrine from the Word which have been implanted 
within that good must be present. In the absence of matters of doctrine the good of life does indeed exist, but it is not as yet that of the Church, and so not as yet truly spiritual, except in 
the sense that it has the potentiality to become so, like the good of life as this exists with gentiles who do not possess the Word and therefore do not know the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'the field' is the 
good of life in which the things of faith, that is, spiritual truths existing with the Church, are implanted, becomes quite clear from the Lord's parable about the sower in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
A sower went out 
to sow, And as he sowed some fell on the pathway, and the birds came and devoured them. Some fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and immediately they sprang up, since they had no 
depth of soil<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>, but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away. Some fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them But some fell on good soil<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 
and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. He who has an ear to hear let him hear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:4-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:4-9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:3-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:3-9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:5-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:5-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This describes four types of land or ground within the 
field, that is, within the Church. The fact that here 'the seed' is the Lord's Word, and so the truth which is called the truth of faith, and that 'the good soil' is the good which is called the good 
of charity is evident to anyone, for it is the good in man that receives the Word. 'The pathway' is falsity, 'rocky ground' is truth which is not rooted in good, 'thorns' are evils.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 With regard 
to the good of life which has its origin in matters of doctrine being meant by 'a man of the field', the position is that those who are being regenerated first of all do good as matters of doctrine 
direct them, for they do not of themselves know what good is. They learn to do good from matters of doctrine concerning love and charity; from these they know who the Lord is, who the neighbour is, what 
love is, and what charity is, and so what good is. Those who have come into this stage are stirred by the affection for truth and are called 'men (vir) of the field'. But after that, once they have 
been regenerated they do good not from matters of doctrine but from love and charity, for the good itself which they have learned about through matters of doctrine exists with them, and they are in that 
case called 'men (homo) of the field'. It is like someone who is by nature inclined to commit adultery, steal, and murder but who learns from the Ten Commandments that such practices belong to hell 
and so refrains from them. In this state he is influenced by the Commandments, for he fears hell and learns from those Commandments and similarly from much else in the Word how he ought to conduct his 
life. In his case when he does what is good he does it from the Commandments. But when good exists with him he starts to loathe adultery, theft, and murder to which he was previously inclined. In this 
state he no longer does what is good from the Commandments but from the good which by now resides with him. In the first state the truth he learns directs him to good, but in the second state good 
is the source of truth taught by him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The same also applies to spiritual truths which are called doctrinal and are more interior Commandments still. For matters of doctrine are interior truths 
which the natural man possesses, the first truths there being sensory ones, the second truths being factual, and interior truths matters of doctrine. The latter are based on factual truths inasmuch as 
a person can have and retain no idea, notion, or concept of them except from factual truths. But the foundations on which factual truths are based are sensory truths, for without sensory truths nobody 
is able to possess factual ones. Such truths, that is to say, factual and sensory, are meant by 'a man skilled in hunting', but matters of doctrine are meant by 'a man of the field'. Such is the order 
in which those kinds of truths stand in relation to one another in man. Until a person has become adult therefore, and through sensory and factual truths possesses matters of doctrine, he is incapable 
of being regenerated, for he cannot be confirmed in the truths contained in matters of doctrine except through ideas based on factual and sensory truths - for nothing is ever present in a person's 
thought, not even the deepest arcanum of faith there, which does not involve some natural or sensory idea, though generally a person is not aware of the essential nature of such ideas. But in the next 
life the nature of them is revealed before his understanding, if he so desires, and also a visual representation before his sight, if he wants it; for in the next life such things can be presented 
before one's eyes in a visual form. This seems unbelievable but it is nevertheless what happens there.

`Vir agri': quod significet bonum vitae ex doctrinalibus, constat ex significatione `agri'; in Verbo multis in locis nominatur terra, et humus, et ager; et per `terram,' cum in bono sensu, significatur 
regnum Domini in caelis et in terris, ita Ecclesia, quae est regnum Domini in terris, similiter per `humum' sed in strictiore sensu, n. 566, 662, 1066-1068, 1262, 1413, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f, 2928; 
eadem quoque significantur per `agrum,' sed in adhuc strictiore sensu, n. 368, 2971; et quia Ecclesia non est Ecclesia ex doctrinalibus nisi quantum illa spectant bonum vitae ut finem, seu quod idem, 
nisi doctrinalia sint conjuncta bono vitae, ideo per `agrum' significatur principaliter bonum vitae; quod ut sit Ecclesiae, erunt doctrinalia ex Verbo, quae bono illi implantata sint; absque {1}doctrinalibus 
est quidem bonum vitae, sed nondum bonum Ecclesiae, ita nondum vere spirituale, nisi modo potentia ut possit fieri, sicut est bonum vitae apud gentes quae non Verbum habent, et ideo ignorant 
Dominum. [2] Quod `ager' sit bonum vitae cui implantentur illa quae sunt fidei, hoc est, vera spiritualia quae sunt Ecclesiae, manifeste constare potest a parabola Domini {2}apud Matthaeum,      
     Exivit seminans ad seminandum, et dum ille seminavit,      alia ceciderunt super viam duram, et venerunt aves et      comederunt ea; alia ceciderunt in petrosa, ubi non habuerunt      humum multam, 
unde cito exorta sunt, propterea quod non      habuerunt profunditatem terrae, cum vero sol exortus est,      exusta sunt, et propterea quod non habuerunt radicem,      exaruerunt:  alia ceciderunt 
inter spinas, et ascenderunt      spinae, et suffocarunt ea: alia vero ceciderunt in terram      bonam, et dederunt fructum, aliud centuplum, aliud      sexagecuplum, aliud trigecuplum: qua 
habet aurem ad audiendum,      audiat, xiii 4-9; Marc. iv 3-9; Luc. viii 5-8; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de quadruplici genere terrae seu humi in agro, hoc est, in Ecclesia; quod ibi `semen' sit Verbum Domini, ita 
verum quod fidei dicitur, et quod `bona terra' sit bonum quod charitatis, {3}patet, nam bonum in homine est quod recipit Verbum; `via dura' est falsum, `petrosum' est verum quod non radicem habet in bono, 
`spinae' sunt mala. [3] Cum bono vitae ex doctrinalibus, quod significatur per `virum agri,' ita se habet: qui regenerantur, primum faciunt bonum ex doctrinalibus, nam ex se non sciunt quid bonum; 
doctrinalia amoris et charitatis sunt, ex quibus discunt, ex illis sciunt quis Dominus, quis proximus, quid amor, et quid charitas, ita quid bonum; cum in hoc statu sunt, in affectione veri sunt, et 
vocantur `viri agri'; at dein, {4}cum regenerati sunt, non faciunt bonum ex doctrinalibus, sed ex amore et charitate, nam tunc in ipso bono sunt quod per doctrinalia didicerunt, et tunc vocantur `homines 
agri'; se habet hoc, sicut qui ex natura inclinat ad adulteria, furta, caedes, sed ex praeceptis decalogi discit quod talia inferni sint, et sic ab illis abstinet; in hoc statu afficitur is praeceptis, 
quia timet infernum, et discit ex illis, et similiter ex Verbo multa, quomodo instruere debeat vitam; tunc cum bonum agit, ex praeceptis bonum agit; at cum in bono est, incipit aversari adulteria, 
furta, caedes, ad quae prius inclinavit; tunc cum in illo statu est, non amplius ex praeceptis bonum agit, sed ex bono quod tunc apud illum; is in priore statu, ex vero discit bonum, in posteriore 
ex bono docet verum: [4] ita quoque se habet cum veris spiritualibus quae vocantur doctrinalia, et adhuc interiora {5}praecepta sunt: doctrinalia enim sunt {6}interiora vera quae naturali homini; prima 
sunt sensualia, altera sunt scientifica, {6}interiora sunt doctrinalia; haec vera fundantur super veris scientificis, quatenus homo non nisi quam ex scientificis ideam, notionem, seu conceptum aliquem 
illorum habere et retinere possit; vera scientifica autem fundantur super veris sensualibus, nam absque sensualibus scientifica (t)ab homine non capi possunt; haec vera, nempe scientifica et sensualia 
sunt, quae significantur per `virum scientem venationis'; doctrinalia autem sunt quae significantur per `virum agri'; succedunt ita apud hominem; quapropter antequam homo in adulta est, et per vera 
sensualia et scientifica in doctrinalibus est, non regenerari potest, non enim confirmari potest in veris doctrinalium nisi per ideas ex scientificis et sensualibus, nam nihil usquam datur apud hominem 
in ejus cogitatione, etiam quoad arcanissimum fidei, quod non secum ideam naturalem et sensualem habet, tametsi homo ut plurimum nescit qualem; sed in altera vita, si desiderat, sistitur illa ei
