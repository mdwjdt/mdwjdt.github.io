<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4049.</strong>有些灵人在头顶上，稍微靠前，和我说话。他们说话令人愉悦，很轻柔地流进来。和其他人不同的是，他们不同于其他人，因为有一种进入天堂的不断憧憬和渴望存在于他们当中。我被告知，这些灵人与脑室或脑子的大腔有关，并且属于这个区域。还补充原因说，这个区域具有这样的性质：它里面有较好的淋巴分泌物，这种淋巴分泌物会回流到脑中，因此具有往那里去的努力。脑就是天堂，这种努力就是那憧憬和渴望。这就是这些对应的性质。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4049</b></p><p><b>4049.</b>
There were some above the head a little toward the front, who spoke with me, speaking pleasantly and inflowing quite gently. They were distinguished from others by the circumstance that they had a constant 
desire and longing to come into heaven. It was said that such are they who relate to the ventricles or larger cavities of the brain, and who belong to that province. The reason was also added-that 
it is the nature of the better kind of lymph which is there to return into the brain, for which it has therefore such an endeavor. The brain is heaven, and this endeavor is that desire and longing. 
Such are the correspondences. </p>

There were certain spirits overhead, slightly to the front, who spoke to me. They spoke in a manner that was pleasant, and flowed in quite gently. They were different from others in that an unceasing 
longing and desire existed with them to enter heaven. I was told that those spirits are such as correlate with the ventricles or cava majora of the brain and who belong to that province. The reason was 
also added that the nature of the better kind of lymphatic secretion within that province is such that it flows back into the brain, to which it therefore possesses the endeavour to go. The brain is 
heaven, and this endeavour is that longing and desire. Such is the nature of these correspondences. </p>

Erant quidam supra caput paulo antrorsum qui mecum locuti; </p>
<p>loquebantur amoene, et influebant satis leniter; distinguebantur ab aliis {1}per id quod illis cupido et desiderium jugiter esset vere in 
caelum; dicebatur quod tales sint qui ventriculos seu cava majora cerebri referunt, et ad provinciam illam {2}pertinent; causa quoque addita, quod melior species lymphae quae inibi, talis sit quod 
nempe redeat in cerebrum, {3}cui inde ei talis conatus: </p>
<p>cerebrum est caelum, et conatus est cupido et desiderium; </p>
<p>correspondentiae sunt tales. @1 in eo$ @2 pertinerent$ @3 etenim inde ei$ </p>
