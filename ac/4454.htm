<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4454.</strong>“示剑对她父亲和弟兄们说”表源于古代神性支系的真理和该宗教表象的良善与真理所进行的商议。这从“说”、“父亲”和“弟兄”的含义，以及“示剑”的代表清楚可知：“说”是指商议；“示剑”是指源于古代神性支系的真理（参看<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；“父亲”，在此系雅各，是指真理的良善（<a href="4273.htm">4273</a>，<a href="4337.htm">4337</a>节）；“弟兄”，在此系雅各的儿子们，是指真理，如前所述。“示剑”表示源于古代神性支系的真理，这一点从前面的引证（参看<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）明显看出来；因为希未人哈抹及其民族和宗族就是属天的上古教会在迦南地的余留。该教会来源于神性，胜过全世界其它一切教会，因为它处于对主之爱的良善。他们的意愿和理解构成一体，因而是一个心智，他们由此从良善拥有对真理的觉知。因为主经由内在途径流入其意愿的良善，并由此流入其理解的良善，也就是他们的真理；这就是为何该教会比其他所有人都被称为“人” （<a href="477.htm">477</a>-<a href="479.htm">479</a>节），以及“神的样式”（<a href="51.htm">51</a>，<a href="473.htm">473</a>，<a href="1013.htm">1013</a>节）的原因。由此明显可知为何说哈抹和示剑源于神性支系（参看<a href="4399.htm">4399</a>节）。被称为“人”或希伯来词“亚当”的上古教会在迦南地，如前所述（<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；这一事实从他们的后代被称为“伟人（Nephilim）”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创6.4.htm">6:4</a>）很明显地看出来；在民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.33.htm">13:33</a>），经上提到这些“伟人”在迦南地（参看<a href="581.htm">581</a>节）。但那时，从埃及河到幼发拉底河的全地都叫“迦南地”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.18.htm">15:18</a>）。</p>

And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brothers. That this signifies a consultation of the truth from the ancient Divine stock with the good and truth of this religiosity, is evident from the 
signification of "saying," as here being to consult; from the representation of Shechem, as being truth from the ancient Divine stock (see above, n. 4447); from the signification of "father," who here 
is Jacob, as being the good of truth (n. 4273, 4337); and from the signification of "brothers," who here are the sons of Jacob, as being truths, of which above. That "Shechem" is truth from the ancient 
Divine stock is evident from what was adduced above (see n. 4447); for Hamor the Hivite, together with his nation and family, were remains in the land of Canaan of the Most Ancient Church, which was 
celestial. More than all the churches in the whole world was this church from the Divine, for it was in the good of love to the Lord. Their voluntary and their intellectual made a one, thus one mind, 
for which reason they had from good a perception of truth, for the Lord flowed in by an internal way into the good of their will, and through this into the good of their understanding, or into their 
truth; and this is the reason why this church was preeminently called "Man" (n. 477-479), and also a "likeness of God" (n. 51, 473, 1013). Hence it is evident why Hamor and Shechem are said to be from 
the ancient Divine stock (see also n. 4399). That the Most Ancient Church which was called "Man," or by the Hebrew word "Adam," was in the land of Canaan (as stated above, n. 4447), is very evident 
from their descendants called "Nephilim" (Gen. 6:4), who were said in Num. 13:33 to have been in the land of Canaan (see n. 581). But at that time all that land was called the "land of Canaan" which extended 
from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). </p>

'And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers' means counsel taken by the truth from the ancient Divine stock with the good and truth of this semblance of religion. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'saying' in this case as taking counsel; from the representation of 'Shechem' as the truth from the ancient Divine stock, dealt with above in <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>; from the meaning of 'father', who in this case 
is Jacob, as the good of truth, dealt with in <a href="4273.htm">4273</a>, <a href="4337.htm">4337</a>; and from the meaning of 'brothers', who in this case are the sons of Jacob, as truths, dealt with above. It is evident from the references quoted 
above in <a href="4447.htm">4447</a> that Shechem means truth from the ancient Divine stock; for Hamor the Hivite together with his nation and family in the land of Canaan were part of the remnants of the Most Ancient 
Church, which was celestial. This Church, more than all other Churches in the whole world, was in origin Divine, for the good of love to the Lord was present in it. Will and understanding with them made 
one, and so one mind, and on that account they had from good a perception of truth. For the Lord was flowing in by an internal route into the good present in their will and from this into the good 
present in their understanding, that is, into their truth, as a consequence of which that Church more than all others was called Man, <a href="477.htm">477</a>-<a href="479.htm">479</a>, and also the Likeness of God, <a href="51.htm">51</a>, <a href="473.htm">473</a>,<a href="1013.htm">1013</a>. From this one 
may see why Hamor and Shechem are said to be from the ancient Divine stock, as previously in <a href="4399.htm">4399</a>. The fact that the Most Ancient Church, which was called 'Man', or to use the Hebrew word 'Adam', was 
located in the land of Canaan, as stated above in <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, is quite evident from their descendants who were called the Nephilim, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%206:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 6:4</a>. The presence of the latter in the land of Canaan is referred to 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:33</a>; see <a href="581.htm">581</a>. But at that time the expression 'the land of Canaan' was used to mean all the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:18</a>. </p>

`Et dixit Shechem ad patrem ejus et ad fratres ejus': quod significet consultationem veri ex antiqua Divina stirpe cum bono et vero hujus religiosi, constat a significatione `dicere' quod hic sit 
consultare; a repraesentatione `Shechemi' quod sit verum ex antiqua Divina stirpe, de qua supra n. 4447; a significatione `patris,' qui hic Jacob, quod sit bonum veri, de qua n. 4273, 4337; </p>
<p>et a significatione 
`fratrum,' qui hic filii Jacobi, quod sint vera, de qua supra. Quod `Shechem' sit verum ex antiqua Divina stirpe, patet ab illis quae supra n. 4447 allata sunt; fuerat enim Hamor Hivaeus 
cum sua gente et familia in terra Canaane inter reliquias Antiquissimae Ecclesiae' quae caelestis; illa Ecclesia prae omnibus Ecclesiis' in universo orbe fuit a Divino, nam in bono amoris in Dominum 
fuit; voluntarium eorum ac intellectuale faciebant unum, ita unam mentem, quapropter perceptionem veri ex bono habebant, influebat enim Dominus per viam internam in bonum voluntatis eorum et per 
hoc in bonum intellectus, seu verum, (m)inde est quod illa Ecclesia prae ceteris vocata sit `Homo,' n. 477-479, et quoque `similitudo Dei,' n. 50 {1}, 473, 1013;(n) inde patet cur Hamor et Shechemus 
dicantur ab antiqua Divina stirpe, ut quoque {2} prius n. 4399 Quod Antiquissima Ecclesia quae `Homo' aut Hebraea voce `Adam' dicta est, fuerit in terra Canaane, prout supra n. 4447 dictum, patet 
manifeste a posteris illorum, qui dicti sunt Nephilim, Gen. vi 4, qui quod in terra Canaane fuerint, dicitur Num. xii 33, videatur n. 581; sed terra Canaan tunc dicta fuit omnis terra a fluvio 
Aegypti ad fluvium Euphratem, Gen. xv 18.      @1 i 50,$      @2 sicut etiam$ </p>
