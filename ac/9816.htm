<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9816.</strong>出埃及记28:3，4.又要对一切心中有智慧的，就是我用智慧的灵所充满的说，给亚伦作衣服，使他分别为圣，可以给我供祭司的职分。这些就是他们要做的衣服：胸牌、以弗得、外袍、杂色的内袍、冠冕、腰带。他们要为你哥哥亚伦和他儿子作圣衣，可以给我供祭司的职分。<br />“又要对一切心中有智慧的说”表主通过圣言进入所有处于爱之良善之人的流注。“就是我用智慧的灵所充满的”表拥有刻在他们上面的神性真理。“给亚伦作衣服”表属灵国度通过他们而存在。“使他分别为圣”表该国度的神性真理的一个代表将由此而存在。“可以给我供祭司的职分”表主的一个代表。“这些就是他们要做的衣服”表在其适当次序中的属灵国度的神性真理。“胸牌”表从神性良善闪耀出来的神性真理。“以弗得”表那里外在形式上的神性真理，内层事物就终止于其中。“外袍”表那里内在形式上的神性真理。“杂色的内袍”表直接从神性属天层发出、从至内在存在于那里的神性真理。“冠冕”表聪明和智慧。“腰带”表一个共同的纽带，好叫一切事物都关注同一个目的。“他们要为你哥哥亚伦和他儿子作圣衣”表毗邻属天国度的属灵国度的一个代表将由此而存在。“可以给我供祭司的职分”表主的一个代表。</p>

Verses 3, 4. And thou shalt speak unto all the wise in heart, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, and they shall make Aaron's garments to sanctify him, that he may minister to Me in the priest's 
office. And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a tunic of checker work, a miter, and a belt; and they shall make garments of holiness for 
Aaron thy brother, and for his sons, that he may minister to Me in the priest's office. "And thou shalt speak unto all the wise in heart," signifies the influx of the Lord through the Word into all who 
are in the good of love; "whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom," signifies in whom Divine truth has been inscribed; "and they shall make Aaron's garments," signifies through whom is the spiritual 
kingdom; "to sanctify him," signifies thereby a representation of the Divine truth in this kingdom; "that he may minister to Me in the priest's office," signifies a representative of the Lord; "and 
these are the garments which they shall make," signifies Divine truths in the spiritual kingdom, in their order; "a breastplate," signifies Divine truth shining forth from Divine good; "and an ephod," 
signifies Divine truth there in the external form in which interior things cease; "and a robe," signifies Divine truth there in the internal form; "and a tunic of checker work," signifies Divine 
truth there inmostly proceeding immediately from the Divine celestial; "a miter," signifies intelligence and wisdom; "and a belt," signifies a general bond, in order that all things may look to one end; 
"and they shall make garments of holiness for Aaron thy brother, and for his sons," signifies thereby a representative of the spiritual kingdom joined to the celestial kingdom; "that he may minister 
to Me in the priest's office," signifies a representative of the Lord. </p>
