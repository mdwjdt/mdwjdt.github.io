Verses 22-27. And when men shall quarrel, and shall strike a pregnant woman, and her births go forth, and harm is not done, with fining he shall be fined, as the woman's master shall lay upon him; and 
he shall give according to the judges. And if harm is done, then thou shalt give soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, blow 
for blow. And when a man shall smite the eye of his manservant, or the eye of his maidservant, and shall destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye. And if he shall knock out his manservant's tooth, 
or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth. "And when men shall quarrel," signifies grievous contention among truths; "and shall strike a pregnant woman," signifies the injuring 
of the good which is from truth; "and her births go forth," signifies if nevertheless it is confirmed in the natural; "and harm is not done," signifies thus no injury there; "with fining he shall 
be fined," signifies amendment; "as the woman's master shall lay upon him," signifies until it agrees with the truth of good; "and he shall give according to the judges," signifies according to what 
is equitable; "and if harm is done," signifies injury; "then thou shalt give soul for soul," signifies the law of order that thou shalt do to thy neighbor as thou wouldest that he should do to thee, 
consequently that what thou doest to another shall be done to thyself, "the soul," denotes the spiritual life; "eye for eye," signifies if anything in the interior intellectual; "tooth for tooth," signifies 
if anything in the exterior intellectual; "hand for hand," signifies if anything of the power of spiritual truth; "foot for foot," signifies if anything of the power of natural truth; "burning 
for burning," signifies if anything of the affection of love which is interiorly in the will; "wound for wound," signifies if anything of the affection of love which is exteriorly in the will; "blow 
for blow," signifies if anything of affection in the intellectual-that is to say, if anything of all these be extinguished or injured; "and when a man shall smite the eye of his manservant," signifies 
if the internal man shall injure the truth of faith in the external or natural man; "or the eye of his maidservant," signifies or the affection of truth therein; "and shall destroy it," signifies if 
he shall extinguish it; "he shall let him go free for his eye," signifies that it can longer serve the internal man; "and if he shall knock out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth," signifies 
if he shall destroy truth or the affection of it in the sensuous part; "he shall let him go free for his tooth," signifies that it can no longer serve the internal man. </p>

Verses 22-27 [And] when men brawl and inflict a blow on a pregnant woman, and her offspring come out, and no harm is done, [the one inflicting the blow] shall surely be fined, as the master of the woman<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
imposes on him; and he shall pay in accordance with the judges.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And if harm is done, you shall pay soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, 
wound for wound, blow for blow. And when a man strikes the eye of his male slave, or the eye of his female slave, and destroys it, he shall send him away free for his eye. And if he strikes out the 
tooth of his male slave or the tooth of his female slave, he shall send him away free for his tooth. </p>
<p>'And when men brawl' means serious contention between truths. 'And inflict a blow on a pregnant 
woman' means injuring the good that is being formed out of truth. 'And her offspring come out' means if in spite of this it is made stronger in the natural. 'And no harm is done' means that thus no injury 
is caused there. '[The one inflicting the blow] shall surely be fined' means amendment. 'As the master of the woman imposes on him' means till it agrees with the truth that goes with the good. 'And 
he shall pay in accordance with the judges' means according to what is right. 'And if harm is done' means injury. 'You shall pay soul for soul' means the law of order that you shall do to your neighbour 
as you wish him to do to you, and therefore that it shall be done to you as you do to another, 'soul' meaning spiritual life. 'Eye for eye' means if anything [is injured by them] in the inner part 
of the understanding. 'Tooth for tooth' means if anything [is injured] in the outer part of the understanding. 'Hand for hand' means if anything of the power of spiritual truth [is injured]. 'Foot 
for foot' means if anything of the power of natural truth [is injured]. 'Burning for burning' means if anything of love and affection present in the inward part of the will [is injured]. 'Wound for wound' 
means if anything of love and affection present in the outward part of the will [is injured]. 'Blow for blow' means if anything of affection in the understanding is wiped out or injured 'And when 
a man strikes the eye of his male slave' means if the internal man injures the truth of faith in the external or natural man. 'Or the eye of his female slave' means if he injures an affection for truth 
there 'And destroys it' means so that it wipes it out<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> 'He shall send him away free for the eye' means that it cannot serve the internal man any longer. 'And if he strikes out the tooth of his male 
slave or the tooth of his female slave' means if it destroys truth or the affection for it on the level of the senses. 'He shall send him away free for his tooth' means that it cannot serve the internal 
man any longer.
