<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10571节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10571</strong>.“耶和华对摩西说，你所说的这件事我也要行”表神性要存在于与他们同在的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在里面。这从“摩西”的代表和“摩西所说的也要行”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”作为这个民族的首领而表示教会、敬拜和圣言的外在，这些外在不像这个民族当中的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在那样与内在之物分离，如前所述（<a href="10557.htm">10557</a>，<a href="10563.htm">10563</a>节）；“摩西所说的也要行”当由耶和华来说时，是指对神性将存在于外在里面的承诺。因为“行这事”意味着与他们同去并把他们领进迦南地，与他们同去并把他们领进迦南地表示神性将在他们当中显现（<a href="10569.htm">10569</a>节）。藏在这几节和接下来的几节经文中的秘密几乎无法描述，除非对摩西所代表的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在，以及与这个民族本身同在的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在有某种概念。二者的区别在于：摩西所代表的外在不像与这个民族本身同在的外在那样与内在如此分离。这就解释了为何经上有时提到“摩西和百姓”，有时提“摩西”，却不提“百姓”，有时提“百姓”，却不提“摩西”；当摩西向耶和华说话时，他说“我和百姓”，而当耶和华向摩西说话时，祂只提摩西（如33:12，14，17，19-23），或与摩西分开的百姓（如34:2，3等）。 </p>

And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this word also that thou hast spoken. That this signifies that the Divine shall be in the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, which is with them, 
is evident from the representation of Moses, in that as the head of that nation he denotes the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, not so separate from the internal as was the external 
of these with the nation itself (of which above, n. 10557, 10563); and from the signification of "doing the word which Moses spoke," when said by Jehovah, as being that the Divine shall be in the 
external; for by "doing the word" is meant to go with them and bring them into the land of Canaan, and by "going with them and bringing them into the land of Canaan" is signified that the Divine shall 
be manifested among them (n. 10569). The secret hidden in these and the following verses can with difficulty be described, unless there is some idea of the external of the church, of worship, and of 
the Word, which Moses represents; and of the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, in which was the nation itself. The one is distinguished from the other in the fact that the external 
which Moses represents is an external not so separate from the internal as is the external in which was the nation itself. From this it is that at one time mention is made of "Moses and the people," 
at another time of "Moses" without the people, and at another of "the people" without Moses; and that when Moses speaks to Jehovah, he says, "I and the people," and when Jehovah speaks to Moses, He speaks 
of Moses alone (as in verses 12, 14, 17, 19-23), or of the people separately from him (as in verses 2 and 3 of the following chapter, and elsewhere). </p>

'And Jehovah said to Moses, I will also do this thing that you have spoken' means that the Divine will be present within that external aspect of the Church, worship, and the Word which exists with them. 
This is clear from the representation of 'Moses', in his capacity as head of that nation, as the external aspect of the Church, worship, and the Word which was not so separate from the internal as 
the external aspect of them among the nation itself was, dealt with above in <a href="10557.htm">10557</a>, <a href="10563.htm">10563</a>; and from the meaning of 'doing the thing that Moses has spoken', when said by Jehovah, as the promise that the 
Divine will be present within the external aspect. For 'doing this thing' implies going with them and leading them into the land of Canaan, and going with them and leading them into the land of Canaan 
means that the Divine will show Himself among them, see above in <a href="10569.htm">10569</a>. </p>
<p>The arcanum that lies concealed in these verses and in those which follow them can scarcely be described unless people have 
an idea of that external aspect of the Church, worship, and the Word which Moses represents, and of that external aspect of the Church, worship, and the Word which existed with the nation itself. The 
one is distinguished from the other by this, that the external that Moses represents is not so separate from the internal as the external existing with the nation itself is. This accounts for the use 
sometimes of the words 'Moses and the people', at other times of 'Moses' without 'the people', or 'the people' without 'Moses', and for Moses' saying, when he speaks to Jehovah, 'I and the people', 
whereas Jehovah, when speaking to Moses, refers to Moses alone, as in verses 12,14,17-23, or to the people separately from him, as in verse 2 of the next chapter<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and elsewhere.

`Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Etiam verbum hoc quod locutus es faciam': quod significet quod Divinum erit in externo Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, quod apud eos, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' 
quod {1}ut caput gentis illius, sit externum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi non ita separatum ab interno, sicut externum (c)illorum apud ipsam gentem, de qua supra n. 10,557, 10,563, et ex significatione 
`facere verbum quod Moscheh locutus est' cum a Jehovah, quod sit quod Divinum erit in externo; {2} per `facere verbum hoc' enim intelligitur ire cum illis, et introducere illos in terram Canaanem, et 
per ire cum illis, et introducere in {3}terram Canaanem, significatur quod Divinum manifestabitur apud illos, videatur supra n. 10,569. Arcanum quod in his et in sequentibus latet, aegre describi potest 
nisi idea habeatur de externo Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, quod Moscheh repraesentat, et de externo Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, {4}in quo ipsa gens erat; distinguitur unum ab altero in eo quod externum, 
quod Moscheh repraesentat, sit externum {5} non ita separatum ab interno, sicut externum in quo ipsa gens; inde est quod nunc dicatur Moscheh et populus, nunc Moscheh absque populo, et nunc populus 
absque Mosche; et quod cum Moscheh loquitur ad Jehovam, dicat `ego et populus,' et cum Jehovah ad Moschen, de solo Mosche, ut in vers. 12, 14, [16,] 17, 18-23, aut de populo separatim ab illo,
