<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3203节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3203.</strong>“就下了骆驼”表该情感一发现理性良善，就与属世人中的记忆知识分离。这从“下了”和“骆驼”的含义清楚可知：“下了”是指分离；“骆驼”是指属世人中的记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>节）。显然，理性良善一被发现，分离就发生了。<br />前面阐述并说明了何谓与属世人分离（<a href="3161.htm">3161</a>，<a href="3175.htm">3175</a>，<a href="3182.htm">3182</a>，<a href="3188.htm">3188</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>节），也就是说，就在真理不再是记忆知识的事，而变成生活的事时，对真理的情感就与属世人分离了。因为当真理变成生活的事时，此人便通过习惯充满它，如同他的性情或天性。当他这样充满它时，可以说它同时流入行为中，而无需他通过任何记忆知识思想它。事实上，当它变成生活的事时，这真理就能对记忆知识发号施令，并从它们那里提取无数确认的事。一切真理都是这种情形；在最初阶段，它是记忆知识的事，但随着此人年龄增长，它变成了生活的事。其中的情形就像小孩子学习走路、说话、思考、运用自己的聪明才智并作出明智的判断。一旦这些事通过习惯变成自发自愿的，它们就会从有关如何做这些事的记忆知识当中消失，并自动流出来，因为它们现在成了本能。<br />对于正在通过主重生或再生之人而言，构成对属灵良善与真理的认知的那些事也是类似情形。一开始，他们就像小孩子。因为那时，属灵真理对他们来说纯粹是记忆知识。教义正在被获取并引入记忆时，无非是记忆知识。然后主将这些记忆知识从记忆中一个接一个地召唤出来，并将它们植入在此人的生命，也就是良善中，因为良善就是生命。一旦出现这种情况，可以说一场转变就发生了，也就是说，此人开始通过良善，即通过生命行事，而不再像以前那样通过记忆知识行事。因此，在这方面，凡正在新生的人都像小孩子，尽管他所吸收的事与属灵生命有关，直到他不再通过教义或真理行事，而是通过仁爱或良善行事。当这种情况发生时，他才第一次处在赐福的状态，智慧也才开始存在于他身上。<br />所有这一切表明什么叫与属世人中的记忆知识分离（由利百加下了骆驼来表示），利百加在知道这是以撒之前就已经做了这一切。如每个人所能看到的，这些细节里面含有奥秘。</p>

And she alighted from off the camel. That this signifies the separation thereof from the memory-knowledges in the natural man at the perception of rational good, is evident from the signification of 
"alighting," as being to be separated; and from the signification of "camels," as being the memory-knowledges in the natural man (see n. 3048, 3071). That it was at the perception of the rational good 
which is represented by Isaac, is evident.  [2] What it is to be separated from the natural man, was stated and shown above (n. 3161, 3175, 3182, 3188, 3190), namely, that the affection of truth is 
separated therefrom when it is no longer a matter of memory-knowledge, but becomes of the life; for when it becomes of the life, by habit the man becomes imbued with it like his disposition or nature; 
and when he is thus imbued with it, it then flows forth into act as it were spontaneously, and this without his thinking about it from any memory-knowledge; nay, when it becomes of the life it can then 
exercise command over the memory-knowledges, and draw from them innumerable things which confirm. Such is the case with all truth; in the first age it is a matter of memory-knowledge, but as the man 
advances in age it becomes of the life. The case herein is like that of children when they are learning to walk, to speak, to think, also to see from the understanding, and to conclude from the judgment; 
which things, when by habit they have become voluntary, and thus spontaneous, vanish from among matters of memory-knowledge, and flow forth of their own accord. [3] So also is it with those things 
which are of the knowledges of spiritual good and truth with men who from the Lord are being regenerated or born again; in the beginning such men are not unlike children, and at first spiritual truths 
are to them mere memory-knowledges; for doctrinal things, when being learned and inserted in the memory, are nothing else; but these are successively called forth thence by the Lord, and are implanted 
in the life, that is, in good; for good is life. When this has been effected there takes place as it were a turning round, namely, that the man begins to act from good, that is, from life, and no 
longer as before from memory-knowledge. Thus he who is being born anew is in this respect like a child (although the things imbibed are of the spiritual life); until he no longer acts from what is doctrinal, 
or truth; but from charity, or good; and when this is the case, he then for the first time is in a blessed state, and is in wisdom. [4] All this shows what it is to be separated from the memory-knowledges 
in the natural man, which is signified by Rebekah's alighting from off the camel; and this before she knew that it was Isaac; in which circumstances, as everyone can see, some arcana are 
involved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3203</b></p><p><b>3203.</b>
'And dropped down from upon the camel' means the separation of this affection from facts within the natural man, at the point when rational good was seen. This is clear from the meaning of 'dropped down' 
as being separated, and from the meaning of 'camels' as facts within the natural man, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>. That the separation took place when rational good, represented by Isaac, was seen is 
self-evident. What is meant by being separated from the natural man has been stated and shown above in <a href="3161.htm">3161</a>, <a href="3175.htm">3175</a>, <a href="3182.htm">3182</a>, <a href="3188.htm">3188</a>, <a href="3190.htm">3190</a>. There one may see that the affection for truth is separated from 
the natural man at the point when truth ceases to be merely something known and becomes a matter of life. For when it becomes a matter of life, then - through the person's habitual reliance on it - that 
truth permeates his whole being in the way that his innate disposition or character does. And when it permeates him in this way it flows so to speak spontaneously into action - without his thinking 
about any fact he has learned regarding that truth. Indeed when it becomes a matter of life, that truth can command those facts, drawing on innumerable ones as confirmations. The situation with all truth 
is that at its earliest stage it is merely something known, but as it develops with a person it becomes a matter of life. It is as it is with young children when they learn to walk, to talk, to think, 
and to use their intelligence and make sensible judgements. Once these activities - through habitual engagement in them - have become unpremeditated and so spontaneous, they disappear from among 
the facts they possess about how to do those things, because they are now instinctive. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A similar situation also exists with the things that constitute the cognitions of spiritual good and truth 
among people whom the Lord is regenerating or causing to be born again. At first they are exactly like young children, in that at that time the spiritual truths which they possess exist as facts, for 
when matters of doctrine are learned and introduced into the memory they are nothing other than facts. But then the Lord summons those facts from the memory one after another and implants them in the 
person's life, that is, in good; for good is his life. Once this has happened a conversion so to speak takes place, that is to say, the person starts to act from good, that is, from life, and no longer 
from knowledge as he had done previously. Accordingly, anyone who is being born anew is like a young child in this respect; but they are matters to do with spiritual life that he absorbs, so that 
he does not act from doctrine, or truth, but from charity, or good. When this happens a state of blessedness begins with him and wisdom begins to exist with him. These considerations show what separation 
from facts within the natural man is, meant by Rebekah's dropping down from upon the camel, which she did before she knew that it was Isaac. These details, as anyone may see, embody arcana within them. </p>

`Et cecidit desuper camelo': quod significet separationem ejus a scientificis in naturali homine, ad perceptionem boni rationalis, constat ex significatione `cadere' quod sit separari; et a significatione 
`camelorum' quod sint scientifica in naturali homine, de qua n. 3048, 3071; quod ad perceptionem boni rationalis quod per Jishakum repraesentatur, patet. Quid sit separari a naturali homine, supra 
n. 3161, 3175, 3182, 3188, 3190 dictum et ostensum est, nempe quod tunc affectio veri separetur inde, cum non amplius fit scientiae, sed vitae; cum enim fit vitae, per habitum {1}imbuit ita hominem, 
sicut indoles aut natura illum; et cum ita {2}induit, tunc sicut sponte effluit in actum, et hoc absque quod ex aliquo scientifico cogitet de illo; immo cum fit vitae, tunc imperare potest scientificis 
et inde innumerabilia depromere quae confirmant; ita se habet cum omni vero, quod in prima aetate est scientiae, at progrediente fit vitae: {3}se habet sicut apud infantes, cum discunt ambulare, 
discant loqui, discant cogitare, ac discunt ex intellectu videre, (c)et ex judicio concludere, quae cum per habitum facta sunt voluntaria et sic spontanea, tunc evanescunt ex scientificis, {4}nam sponte 
effluunt; [2] ita quoque se habet cum illis quae sunt cognitionum (t)boni et veri spiritualis apud homines qui a Domino regenerantur seu renascuntur; illi principio nec aliter sunt quam infantes, vera 
spiritualia illis primum sunt scientifica, doctrinalia enim cum addiscuntur et {5}memoriae inseruntur, non aliud sunt, sed illa a Domino successive inde evocantur, ac implantantur vitae, hoc est, 
bono, nam bonum est {6}vita; quo facto, fit quasi versura, nempe quod homo incohet ex bono, hoc est, ex vita agere, nec amplius, ut prius, ex scientia; ita qui e novo nascitur, similis in hoc est infanti, 
sed sunt vitae spiritualis quae imbuit, usque ut non ex doctrinali seu vero, sed ex charitate seu bono agat; cum hoc fit, tunc primum est in statu beato, et in sapientia. Ex his constare potest quid 
sit separari a scientificis in naturali homine, quod significatur per quod `Rebecca ceciderit desuper camelo,' et hoc antequam novit quod Jishakus esset: quae quod arcana involvant, quisque videre 
potest. @1 induit$  @2 imbuit T$  @3 est$   @4 ac$  @5 memoria tenentur$  @6 vitae$  </p>
