<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2712节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2712.</strong>“他住在巴兰的旷野”表属灵之人在良善方面的生命。这从“住”的含义清楚可知，“住”用来论及居于真理中的良善，也就是属灵之善，即属灵之人的良善。它的品质以 “他住在巴兰的旷野”（稍后论述）来描述。“住”用来论及居于真理中的良善，或对真理的情感。这一事实从圣言中论述城的许多经文明显看出来。这些城表示真理，它们不会有任何居民，居民表良善（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2450.htm">2450</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>节）；由于良善居于真理中，故没有良善的真理就像无人居住的城。如西番雅书：<br />我使他们的街道荒凉，以致无人经过；他们的城邑毁灭，以致无居民。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.6.htm">3:6</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华引导我们经过旷野，那里无人经过，也无人居住；他们使他的地荒凉；他的城邑也都焚烧，无人居住。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.6.htm">2:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.15.htm">15</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />各城被撇下，无人住在其中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.29.htm">4:29</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />在这荒凉无人无居民无牲畜的耶路撒冷的街上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.10.htm">33:10</a>）<br />“街”表真理（<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）；“无人”表无属天之善；“无居民”表无属灵之善；“无牲畜”表无属世之善。同一先知书：<br />摩押的城邑必荒凉，无人住在其中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.9.htm">48:9</a>）<br />先知书中的每个词都具有真理与良善的婚姻；因此，经上说“城邑”荒凉时，也会补充说“无人住在其中”；因为城表真理，居民表良善；否则，经上已经说城邑荒凉了，又说没有居民就是多余的。同样，有些词始终表示属天之善的事物，有些词始终表示属灵之善的事物，有些词则始终表示真理的事物。如以赛亚书：<br />你的种必拥有列族，他们要住在荒凉的城邑。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.3.htm">54:3</a>）<br />此处“拥有”论及属天之善；“住”论及属灵之善。同一先知书：<br />我的选民必拥有它，我的仆人要在那里居住。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.9.htm">65:9</a>）<br />此处意思是一样的。<br />诗篇：<br />神要拯救锡安，建造犹大的城邑，他们要在那里居住，要拥有它；祂仆人的种也要承受它，爱祂名的人要住在其中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.35.htm">69:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.36.htm">36</a>）<br />“住”同时“拥有”论及属天之善；而“住”论及属灵之善。以赛亚书：<br />对耶路撒冷说，必有人居住。对犹大的城邑说，必被建造。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.26.htm">44:26</a>）<br />此处“住”或“有人居住”论及属灵教会，也就是耶路撒冷的良善。在圣言中，论及他们自己的良善和自己的真理所用的词语到了这种程度，即仅通过了解所使用的这些词，人就能意识到总体上所论述的主题是什么。</p>

He dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. That this signifies the life of the spiritual man as to good, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being predicated of the good of truth, or of spiritual 
good, that is, of the good of the spiritual man. What its quality is, is described by his "dwelling in the wilderness of Paran" which is to be treated of presently. That "to dwell" is predicated 
of the good, that is, of the affection, of truth, is evident from many passages in the Word where cities are treated of, by which truths are signified, and as being without an inhabitant, by whom good 
is signified (n. 2268, 2450, 2451); for truths are inhabited by good; and truths without good are like a city in which there is no one dwelling. So in Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     I have made their streets waste, 
that none passeth by; their cities are desolated, so that there is no inhabitant (Zeph. 3:6). [2] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah led us through the wilderness, where no man passed through, and where 
no man dwelt; they had made his land a waste, his cities are burned up, so that there is no inhabitant (Jer. 2:6, 15). In the same: </p>
<p>     Every city is forsaken, and no one dwelleth therein (Jer. 4:29). In 
the same: </p>
<p>     In the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast (Jer. 33:10); </p>
<p>"streets" denote truths (n. 2336); "without man" denotes no 
celestial good; "without inhabitant," no spiritual good; and "without beast," no natural good. In the same: </p>
<p>     The cities of Moab shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein (Jer. 48:9). [3] 
In the Prophets in every expression there is the marriage of truth and good; and therefore where a city is said to be desolate, it is also added that there is no inhabitant in it; for the reason 
that the city signifies truths, and the inhabitant good; otherwise it would be superfluous to say that there was no inhabitant, when it has been said that the city was desolate. So likewise the expressions 
are constant that signify the things of celestial good, those of spiritual good, and those of truth; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thy seed shall possess the nations, and they shall dwell in the desolate 
cities (Isa. 54:3); </p>
<p>where to "possess" is predicated of celestial goods; and to "dwell in," of spiritual good. In the same: </p>
<p>     Mine elect shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there (Isa. 
65:9); </p>
<p>where the signification is the same. [4] In David: </p>
<p>     God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah and they shall dwell there, and shall possess it; the seed also of His servants 
shall inherit it, and they that love His name shall dwell therein (Ps. 69:35-36); </p>
<p>"dwelling" and at the same time "possessing," is predicated of celestial good; but "dwelling," of spiritual good. 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah, ye shall be built (Isa. 44:26); </p>
<p>where "dwelling," or "inhabiting," is predicated of the good of the spiritual 
church, which is "Jerusalem." To such a degree are the expressions in the Word predicated of their own goods and their own truths, that merely from a knowledge of the predication of these expressions 
it can be known what subject in general is treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2712</b></p><p><b>2712.</b>
'He dwelt in the wilderness of Paran' means the life of the spiritual man as regards good. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling' as being used in reference to good residing in truth, which is 
spiritual good, that is, good present with the spiritual man. The essential nature of that good is described by his dwelling in the wilderness of Paran, dealt with immediately below. That 'dwelling' is 
used in reference to good residing in truth, or to the affection for truth, is clear from many places in the Word where it is said of cities, which mean truths, that they will be without any inhabitant, 
by whom good is meant, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>; for truths are inhabited by good, and truths devoid of good are like a city that has no one dwelling in it, as in Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I have laid their streets 
waste, so that none passes through; their cities are desolate, so that there is no one dwelling in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah was leading us through the wilderness. No man passed 
through in that [land], and no one dwelt there. They have turned his land into a solitary place, his cities have been burned, so that none is dwelling there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:%206,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2: 6, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Every 
city has been forsaken, with no one dwelling in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4: 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
In the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate there is no human being, no inhabitant, no beast. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2033:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 33: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Streets' stands for truths, <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>, 'no human being' for no celestial good, 'no inhabitant' for no spiritual good, 'no beast' for no natural good. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The cities of Moab 
will become a desolation, with no one dwelling in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 With each particular expression in the Prophets there exists the marriage of truth and good. Consequently when 'a city' is said 
to be desolate, the phrase 'no one dwelling in it' is also added, the reason being that 'a city' means truths and 'one dwelling in it' good. Otherwise it would be superfluous to say 'no one dwelling 
in it' when it has been stated that the city is desolate. In a similar way certain terms occur consistently to mean things that belong to celestial good, others that belong to spiritual good, and others 
also that belong to truths, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Your seed will possess the nations, and they will dwell in the desolate cities. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54: 3</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'possessing' has reference to celestial good, 'dwelling 
in' to spiritual good. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
My chosen ones will possess it, and My servants will dwell there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
God will save Zion 
and will build the cities of Judah; and they will dwell there and possess it, and the seed of His servants will inherit it, and those loving His name will dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:%2035,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69: 35, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Dwelling 
there' and at the same time 'possessing' has reference to celestial good, 'dwelling in' to spiritual good. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He who says to Jerusalem, You will be dwelt in; and to the cities of Judah, You 
will be built. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44: 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'dwelling in' has reference to the good of the spiritual Church, which is Jerusalem. To such an extent do the terms used in the Word have reference to their own goods 
and their own truths that simply from a knowledge of that usage of terms one may recognize what the subject is in general that is being dealt with. </p>

`Habitavit in deserto Paran':  quod significet vitam spiritualis hominis quoad bonum, constat ex significatione `habitare' quod praedicetur de bono veri, seu de bono spirituali, hoc est, de bono spiritualis 
hominis; quod quale sit, describitur per id quod `habitaret in deserto Paran,' de quibus mox sequitur. Quod `habitare' praedicetur de bono seu affectione veri, constat a pluribus locis Verbi 
ubi agitur de `urbibus,' per quas significantur vera, quod erunt absque `habitatore', per quem significatur bonum, n. 2268, (x)2449, 2451; vera enim inhabitantur a bono; et sunt vera absque bono, sicut 
urbs in qua {1} non habitans, ut apud Zephaniam, 	Vastare feci plateas eorum, ut non transiens; desolatae sunt urbes eorum, ut non ullus habitans, iii 6: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	[2] Jehovah deducens nos 
per desertum,... non transiit in ea vir, et non habitavit homo ibi;... posuerunt terram ejus in solitudinem, urbes ejus exustae, ut non habitans, ii 	6, 15: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Omnis urbs derelicta, et nemo 
habitans in eis, iv 29: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	In plateis Hierosolymae desolatis, et nullus homo, et nullus habitator, et nulla bestia, xxxiii 10; </p>
<p>`plateae' pro veris, n. 2336, `nullus homo' pro nullo bono 
caelesti, `nullus habitator' pro nullo bono spirituali, `nulla bestia' pro nullo bono naturali: apud eundem, 	Urbes Moabi in desolationem erunt, nullus habitans in eis, xlviii 9. [3] Apud Prophetas 
in singulis expressionibus est {2} conjugium veri et boni, quare ubi `urbs desolata' dicitur, etiam adjicitur quod `non habitans in ea,' ex causa quia `urbs' significat vera, et `habitans' bonum, alioquin 
superfluum foret dicere non habitans ubi dictum quod urbs desolata sit: (m) similiter sunt voces constantes, quae significant illa quae (o)sunt boni caelestis, quae boni spiritualis, tum quae 
veri, ut apud Esaiam, 	Semen tuum gentes possidebit, et urbes desolatas habitabunt, liv 3; </p>
<p>ubi `possidere' praedicatur de bono caelesti, `habitare' de bono spirituali: apud eundem, 	Possidebunt eam 
electi Mei, et servi Mei habitabunt 	ibi, liv 3; </p>
<p>[4] similiter: apud Davidem, 	Deus salvabit Zionem, et aedificabit civitates Jehudae, et habitabunt ibi et possidebunt eam, et semen servorum ejus 	hereditabunt 
eam, et amantes nomen Ipsius habitabunt in ea, Ps. lxix 36, 37 [A V.3 5, 36]; </p>
<p>`habitare et simul possidere' praedicatur {3} de bono caelesti, `habitare' de bono spirituali: apud Esaiam, 	Dicens 
Hierosolymae, Habitaberis, et civitatibus Jehudae, Aedificabimini, xliv 26; </p>
<p>ubi `habitare' praedicatur de bono spiritualis Ecclesiae, quae est `Hierosolyma': in tantum voces in Verbo praedicantur
