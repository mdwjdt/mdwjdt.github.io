<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2500节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2500.</strong>“亚伯拉罕从那里向南地迁移”表主在信之善与真方面的发展。这从“寄居”和“南地”的含义清楚可知：“寄居”是指发展（参看<a href="1457.htm">1457</a>节）；“南地”是指信的良善与真理（参看<a href="1458.htm">1458</a>节）。关于亚伯拉罕，在创世记第12章，经上说他进入埃及后“又继续踏上往南地去的旅程”（12:9，10），这在内义上表示就由认知构成的记忆知识而言，主在孩童时逐渐进入良善与真理（<a href="1456.htm">1456</a>，<a href="1459.htm">1459</a>节）。本章经上说他“向南地迁移”，这表示更内在的、进一步的发展；就信之教义而言，这次是向良善与真理深入发展。这就是为何此处用“南地”这个词，因为严格来说，“地”（land）表示教会，教义因为教会的缘故而存在（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>节）。<br />至于总体而言主的教导，它的性质从本章的内义很清楚地看出来，也就是说，祂通过一系列启示，因而通过来自祂自己，即来自其神性的神性直觉和思维而接受教导。祂将这些直觉和思维植入在神性的聪明智慧中，直到实现其人性与神性的完美合一。这种增长智慧的方式是其他任何人根本可能具有的，因为它是从神性本身流入的；而这神性本身是祂的至内在，是父的，祂从父成孕。因此，它源于唯独主所拥有的圣爱本身，圣爱就在于祂渴望拯救全人类。<br />这是一个几乎无人知道的奥秘，即爱本身具有智慧聪明在里面，但这些智慧聪明的性质则取决于爱的性质。智慧聪明在爱里面，其原因是一切流注都进入爱里面，或也可说，进入良善里面，从而进入人的生命本身里面。这就是天使所具有的妙不可言的智慧聪明的源头。这也是由对主之爱和对邻之仁所主导之人具有的智慧聪明的源头。虽然活在肉身时，他们对自己所具有的这种智慧聪明没有任何觉察，但死后就会进入这些智慧聪明，因为它们就存在于爱本身和仁爱本身里面（参看<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>节）。不过，至于主的爱，它无限超越天使所具有的爱，因为这爱是圣爱本身，因此祂有最顶尖的一切智慧聪明在里面。然而，由于祂生而为人，要作为人照着神序发展，故祂将自己逐步引入这些智慧聪明，以便祂能由此将其人性与神性融合起来，使其人性成为神性，而且祂做这一切凭的是祂自己的力量。</p>

Abraham journeyed thence toward the land of the south. That this signifies the Lord's progression in the goods and truths of faith, is evident from the signification of "journeying," as being to progress 
(see n. 1457); and from the signification of the "land of the south," as being the good and truth of faith (see n. 1458). It has already been stated concerning Abraham, in the twelfth chapter, that 
he "journeyed, going and journeying toward the south," when he went into Egypt (verses 9, 10); by which was signified in the internal sense that the Lord when a child progressed into goods and truths 
in respect to the memory-knowledge of knowledges (n. 1456, 1459);* and here it is said that he journeyed "toward the land of the south," by which there is signified a further and more interior progression, 
which is into goods and truths in respect to the doctrine of faith; on which account it is here said the "land" of the south, because "land" in its proper sense signifies the church, for the 
sake of which is doctrine (n. 566, 662, 1066, 2117, 2118). [2] As regards the Lord's instruction in general, the nature of it is very clear in the internal sense of this chapter; namely, that it was 
by continual revelations, and thus by Divine perceptions and thoughts from Himself, that is, from His Divine; which perceptions and thoughts He implanted in Divine intelligence and wisdom, and this even 
to the perfect union of His Human with His Divine. This way of growing wise is not possible with any man; for it flowed in from the Divine itself, which was His inmost, being of the Father, of whom 
He was conceived; thus from the Divine Love itself, which the Lord alone had, and which consisted in His desire to save the universal human race. [3] It is an arcanum which is as yet known to scarcely 
anyone, that within love itself there are wisdom and intelligence; these being such as is the love. That wisdom and intelligence are within love comes from the fact that all influx takes place into 
the love, or what is the same, into the good, thus into man's very life. This is the source of the wisdom and intelligence of the angels, which is ineffable. It is also the source of the wisdom and intelligence 
of men who are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor; who, although they have no perception of it in themselves while they are living in the body, nevertheless come into it 
after death, for the reason that it is within this very love and charity (see n. 2494). But as regards the Lord's love, it was infinitely above the love in which the angels are, for it was the Divine 
love itself; and therefore He had in Himself a supereminence of all wisdom and intelligence; into which however because He was born a man, and was to progress as a man according to Divine order, He 
introduced Himself by successive steps, in order that He might thus unite His Human to the Divine, and make it Divine; and this by His own power. * That is in respect to possessing a mere memory acquaintance 
with the knowledges of what is good and true. [Reviser.] </p>

'Abraham travelled from there towards the land of the south' means the Lord's advances in goods and truths of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'travelling' as advancing, dealt with in <a href="1457.htm">1457</a>, and 
from the meaning of 'the land of the south' as the good and truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="1458.htm">1458</a>. Previously in Chapter <a href="12.htm">12</a> it was said of Abraham when entering Egypt that 'he travelled, going on and 
travelling towards the south', verses 9, 10, which meant in the internal sense that the Lord, when a boy, made advances into goods and truths as regards knowledge consisting of cognitions, <a href="1456.htm">1456</a>, <a href="1459.htm">1459</a>. 
Now in the present chapter it is said that he travelled towards the land of the south, which means further and more interior advances, made this time into goods and truths as regards the doctrine of 
faith. This is why the expression 'the land of the south' is used here, for 'land' in its proper sense means the Church, for whose sake doctrine exists, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>. </p>

 As regards the 
Lord's instruction in general, the nature of it is quite plain from the internal sense of this chapter. From that sense it is plain that He was taught through a whole succession of revelations and 
so through Divine perceptions and thoughts from Himself, that is, from His Divine. These perceptions and thoughts He implanted in Divine intelligence and wisdom, and continued to do so until the perfect 
union of His Human and His Divine had been effected. This way of becoming wise is not at all open to anyone else, for it sprang from the Divine itself, which was His inmost, being the Father's, from 
whom He had been conceived. Thus it sprang from the Divine Love itself which the Lord alone possessed and which constituted His desire to save the entire human race. </p>

 It is an arcanum as yet known 
by scarcely anyone that love itself holds wisdom and intelligence within it, but that the nature of these is determined by that of the love. The reason wisdom and intelligence exist within love is 
that all influx takes place into the love, or what amounts to the same, into the good, and so into the life itself of man. This is the source of the wisdom and intelligence possessed by angels, which 
are beyond description. It is the source also of the wisdom and intelligence possessed by men who are governed by love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. Although during their lifetime the 
latter do not discern at all the presence with them of such wisdom and intelligence, they nevertheless enter into these after death for the reason that they exist within love itself and within charity 
itself, see <a href="2494.htm">2494</a>. As for the Lord's love however, this was infinitely higher than the love which exists in angels, for it was Divine Love itself, and therefore He had within Himself the acme of all 
wisdom and intelligence. Yet into the possession of this, because He was born a human being (homo) and advanced as a human being does according to Divine order, He entered by successive degrees so that 
He might in that way unite His Human to the Divine and make it Divine, doing so by His own power. </p>

`Profectus est inde Abraham versus terram meridiei quod significet progressionem Domini in bonis et veris fidei, constat a significatione `proficisci' quod sit progredi, de qua n. 1457; et significatione 
`terrae meridiei' quod sit bonum et verum fidei, de qua n. 1458.  Prius in capite duodecim dictum (o)est de Abrahamo quo `profectus eundo et proficiscendo versus meridiem,' cum in Aegyptum ibi vers. 
9, 10, quibus significatum in sensu interno quod Dominus, cum puer, progressus {1} in bona et vera quoad scientiam cognitionum n. 1456, 1459; hic nunc quod profectus versus terram meridiei, quibus 
significatur ulterior et interior progressio, quae est in bona et ver quoad doctrinam fidei {2}, quare hic dicitur `terra meridiei,' quia `terra' in suo proprio sensu significat Ecclesiam, pro qua doctrina,

sic per Divinas perceptiones et cogitationes ab ipso, hoc est, a Divino Ipsius, quas implantavit Divinae intelligentiae et sapientiae,' et hoc usque ad perfectam unionem Ipsius Humani cum Ipsius Divino; 
haec via sapiendi nusquam dabilis est apud aliquem hominem, nam influxit ab Ipso Divino quod (o)erat intimum Ipsius, quia Patris, a Quo conceptus: ita ab Ipso Divino Amore, qui soli Domino fuit, qui 
fuit quod universum genus humanum salvare vellet.  [3] Est arcanum quod vix adhuc alicui notum est quod in ipso amore insit {4} sapientia et intelligentia, sed qualis amor talis est; quod in amore insit 
sapientia et intelligentia, inde est, quia omnis influxus fit in amorem, seu quod idem, in bonum, ita in ipsam vitam hominis; inde est sapientia et intelligentia angelorum, quae ineffabilis; inde 
etiam sapientia et intelligentia hominum qui in amore in Dominum et charitate erga proximum; hi tametsi eam apud se non appercipiunt dum vivunt in corpore, usque in illam post obitum veniunt, ex causa 
quia illa in ipso amore et in ipsa charitate inest, videatur n. 2494. Quod autem amorem Domini attinet, ille fuit infinite supra amorem in quo sunt angeli, fuit enim ipse Divinus, quare in se habuit 
supereminens omnis sapientiae et intelligentiae, in quod tamen, quia natus homo et progressurus sicut homo secundum ordinem Divinum, successive Se induxit, ut Humanum Suum ita uniret Divino, et faceret 
Divinum, et hoc propria potentia. 	@1 profectus$ 	@2 First draft has quibus similiter significatur progressio sed hic non in scientiam cognitionum, ut prius, verum in illis qui sunt ipsius doctrinae,
