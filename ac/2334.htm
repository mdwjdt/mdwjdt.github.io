<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2334节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2334.</strong>“他们说，不”表质疑，这在试探期间是很常见的。这从他们婉拒，然而又进到他屋里清楚看出来。所有试探中都有对主的临在和怜悯，以及救恩和类似事情的某些质疑，因为凡经历试探的人都会遭受内在焦虑，甚至绝望。他们大部分时间被保持在这种状态，好让他们最终确认这一事实，即万事万物皆出于主的怜悯；他们唯有靠主才能得救；并且他们自己只有邪恶；他们通过所战胜的冲突而得以确认这一事实。试探过后，从它留下很多真理与良善的状态，这些真理与良善就是他们的思维后来被主所折向的。否则，其思维必冲向疯狂，将心智引向真理与良善的对立面。<br />由于“罗得”在此描述了教会的第一个状态，该教会具有仁之善，但处于外在敬拜，还由于一个人在进入这种状态之前，要接受改造，而这种改造也是通过某种试探实现的（不过，具有外在敬拜的人只经历轻微的试探），故此处经上才提及这些含有某种试探的事情，即那两个天使先是说在街上过夜，罗得切切地请他们，他们才转向他，进到他屋里。</p>

And they said, Nay. That this signifies the doubting which is wont to attend temptation, may be seen from their declining and yet going into his house. In all temptation there is somewhat of doubt concerning 
the Lord's presence and mercy, and concerning salvation and the like things; for those who are in temptation are in interior anxiety, even to despair; in which they are for the most part kept, 
to the end that they may be at length confirmed in the fact that all things are of the Lord's mercy; that they are saved by Him alone; and that with themselves there is nothing but evil; in respect 
to which they are confirmed by means of conflicts in which they overcome. After the temptation there remain from it many states of truth and good to which their thoughts may afterwards be bent by the 
Lord, which would otherwise rush into insane things, and draw away the mind into opposition to what is true and good. [2] Since by "Lot" there is here treated of the first state of the church which is 
in the good of charity but in external worship, and since before a man comes into this state he is to be reformed, which is also done by a certain kind of temptation (but they who are in external worship 
undergo only a light temptation), therefore these things which involve something of temptation are said, namely, that the angels at first said they would pass the night in the street, and that Lot 
urged them, and so they turned aside to him, and came into his house. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2334</b></p><p><b>2334.</b>
'And they said, No' means the doubting which is usually present during temptation. This becomes clear from their saying 'No' but nevertheless entering his house. All temptation entails feelings of doubt 
regarding the Lord's presence and mercy, regarding salvation, and other things such as these; for people who experience temptation suffer mental distress, even to the point of despair, in which state 
they are kept for the most part so that at length they may be confirmed in the conviction that all things are subject to the Lord's mercy, that they are saved through Him alone, and that with themselves 
there is nothing but evil - convictions in which they are strengthened through conflicts in which they are victorious. Remaining from temptation after this is over, there are further states of 
truth and good to which their thoughts - which would otherwise dart off into interests that are insane and draw the mind away into an aversion to what is true and good - can subsequently be turned to 
the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since 'Lot' here describes the first state of the Church in which the good of charity exists but whose worship is external, and since before he enters this state a person is to be reformed 
- such reformation being effected also by means of a certain kind of temptation (though those whose worship is external undergo only mild temptation) - things are therefore said here which imply 
something of temptation. Those things are that at first the angels declared that they would spend the night in the street but that Lot urged them and so they turned aside to him and entered his house. </p>

</p><b>2334.</b>
`Et dixerunt, Non': quod significet dubitationem quae solet esse tentationis, constare potest a negatione, et quod usque iverint in domum ejus; in omni tentatione est dubitativum, de `praesentia et 
misericordia' Domini, deque salvatione, et similibus; sunt enim in anxietate interiore, usque ad desperationem, in qua ut plurimum tenentur, ob causam ut confirmentur tandem in eo quod omnia sint misericordiae 
Domini, quod per Ipsum solum salventur, et quod apud se nihil nisi malum sit, de quibus per pugnas in quibus vincunt, confirmantur: manent post tentationem inde plures status veri et boni, ad 
quos flecti dein possunt a Domino cogitationes, quae alioquin ruerent in vesana, et contra verum et bonum traherent mentem: quia hic per `Lotum' agitur de primo statu Ecclesiae quae in bono charitatis 
est at in cultu externo, et antequam homo in hunc statum venit, reformandus est, quod fit etiam per quandam speciem tentationis, sed qui in cultu externo, (o)ii modo levem tentationem subeunt, ideo 
haec dicta sunt, quae involvunt tentationis quoddam, nempe quod angeli primum dicerent {1} quod `pernoctarent in platea,' et quod Lot urgeret illos, et sic quod `declinaverint ad illum, et venerint in 
domum ejus.' 	@1 i Non, et.$ </p>
