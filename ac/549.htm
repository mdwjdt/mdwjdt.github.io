<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第549节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>549.</strong>天使状态是这样的，人人都将自己的幸福快乐传给他人，因为在来生（灵界），所有情感与思维都会被完美地交流与觉察到，以便每个人都能将他的快乐传给所有人，所有人的快乐传给每个人。因此，每一个体可以说都是全体的焦点。这就是天堂的形式。所以，组成主王国的人越多，幸福就越大，因为它会随着人数增加而增长，这就是为何天堂幸福难以形容的原因。当人爱他人胜过自己时，这种全体与个体，以及个体与全体的交流就得以存在。但是，如果谁都希望自己比别人好，对我欲就会占主导地位，这爱除了自我的观念外，不会与他人分享任何东西，它是非常肮脏的。一旦觉察到这一点，这人会立刻被分离并逐出。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]549.</strong> The angelic state is such that everyone conveys his or her own blessings and happiness to others. In the next life there is a communication and keen perception of all feelings and thoughts, so that in the sharing of joy each communicates to all and all to each, which essentially makes every individual the center of all the rest. This is how heaven is set up.<br />As a result, the more people there are to make up the Lord's kingdom, the greater the happiness is; it increases as the numbers increase. This is why heavenly happiness is inexpressible.<br />Such a sharing of all with one and one with all exists whenever we love another person more than ourselves. But when we wish better to ourselves than to another, self-love takes control. Self-love shares nothing of its own with others except its self-conception, which is actually something extremely filthy. When this conception is perceived by others, we are immediately cut off and rejected. </p>

The angelic state is such that everyone communicates his own bliss and happiness to others. For in the other life there is a most exquisite communication and perception of all the affections and thoughts, 
so that each person communicates his joy to all, and all to each, so that each one is as it were the center of all. This is the heavenly form. And therefore the more there are who constitute the 
Lord's kingdom, the greater is the happiness, for it increases in proportion to the numbers, and this is why heavenly happiness is unutterable. There is this communication of all with each and of each 
with all when everyone loves others more than himself. But if anyone wishes better for himself than for others the love of self reigns, which communicates nothing to others from itself except the idea 
of self, which is very foul, and when this is perceived the person is at once banished and rejected. </p>

The angelic slate is such that everyone communicates his own blessedness and happiness to others, for in the next life all affections and thoughts are communicated and perceived faultlessly. Each individual 
therefore communicates his own joy to all others, and so do all to each individual. Consequently each individual is so to speak the focal point of all. This is the heavenly form. The more there 
are to constitute the Lord's kingdom therefore, the greater the happiness, for this grows in proportion to the increase in numbers. This is why heavenly happiness is indescribable. Such communication 
of all with individuals and of individuals with all exists when one loves another more than himself. But if anyone wishes to better himself rather than others, self-love reigns which communicates nothing 
of itself to others but the idea of self, which is a most foul idea. And when this is perceived that person is instantly separated and expelled.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 549</b>
</p><b>549.</b>
Talis est status angelicus ut unusquisque suam beatitudinem et felicitatem communicet alteri; nam omnium affectionum et cogitationum communicatio et perceptio exquisitissima datur in altera vita, quare 
unusquisque communicat suum gaudium omnibus, et omnes unicuique, sic ut unusquisque sit quasi centrum omnium; quod est forma caelestis: quare quo plures qui regnum Domini constituunt, eo major felicitas, 
nam in ratione plurium augescit; inde est quod felicitas caelestis sit ineffabilis.  Communicatio talis est omnium cum singulis, et singulorum cum omnibus, cum amat unus alterum plus quam semet: 
at si quis sibi melius vult quam alteri, tunc sui amor regnat, qui nihil ex se communicat alteri quam sui ideam, quae est spurcissima; quae cum percipitur, ilico dissociatur et rejicitur. </p>
