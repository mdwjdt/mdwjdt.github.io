<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2336节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2336.</strong>“街”表真理。这从圣言中的很多经文清楚可知，如约翰福音论到新耶路撒冷说：<br />十二个门是十二颗珍珠，每门是一颗珍珠。城内的街道是精金，好像明透的玻璃。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.21.htm">21:21</a>）<br />“新耶路撒冷”是指主的国度，因描述其良善与真理，故通过“城墙”、“门”和“街道”来描述它。“街道”是指通向良善的信的一切事物，或通向爱与仁的信的一切事物；因为这时真理已属乎良善，从而因良善而透明，街道被说成是“金”的，“好像明透的玻璃”。<br />经过城内街道的中央；在河的两边有生命树，结十二样果子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.2.htm">22:2</a>）<br />这也论及新耶路撒冷，或主的国度。“街道的中央”表信之真理，良善藉这信之真理而来，此后，信之真理又出自良善。“十二样果子”就是所谓信的果实；因为“十二”表信的一切事物，如前所示（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>-<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节）。<br />但以理书：<br />你当知道、当明白，从发出命令恢复和重建耶路撒冷，直到有首领弥赛亚的时候，必有七个七和六十二个七。耶路撒冷城连街带濠都必恢复并重建。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.25.htm">9:25</a>）<br />这论及主的到来，“耶路撒冷城连街带濠都必恢复并重建”表那时没有真理与良善。众所周知，那时耶路撒冷不会恢复并建造；并且只要不把思想固定在世俗国度上，而是专注于天上的国度，也就是“耶路撒冷”的内义所表示的，谁都会知道，耶路撒冷城不会恢复并重建。<br />路加福音：<br />家主对仆人说，快出去，到城里大街小巷，领那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的来。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.21.htm">14:21</a>）<br />拘守于字义的人由此只会想到仆人要到各处去，这就是“大街小巷”所表示的；他要将每个人接来，这就是“贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的”所表示。但这些话的每一句里面都包含奥秘，因为它们是主的话。他要到“大街小巷”表他要到处寻求纯正的真理，或良善所闪耀出的真理，或良善通过它而闪耀。他要“领那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的来”表领来的这些人在古教会被称为贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，即他要领那些在信方面是这样，但却过着良善生活的人来（他们因此应接受有关主国度的教导），因而要领那些尚未接受指教的外邦人来。<br />由于“街”表真理，故在街上教导是犹太人中的一个代表性惯例，这从马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.2.htm">6:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.5.htm">5</a>）和路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.26.htm">13:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.27.htm">27</a>）明显看出来。在先知书中，无论哪里提及的“街”，在内义上要么表真理，要么表与真理相反之物。如以赛亚书：<br />公平转而退后，公义站在远处；真理在街上仆倒，正直也不得进入。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.14.htm">59:14</a>）<br /><br />你的众子发昏，躺在街头。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.20.htm">51:20</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />死亡上来，进了我们的窗户，入了我们的宫殿，要从街上剪除孩童，从路上剪除少年人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.21.htm">9:21</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />尼布甲尼撒必用他的马蹄践踏你一切的街道。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.11.htm">26:11</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗表对真理的认知（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。“马蹄”表败坏真理的记忆知识。那鸿书：<br />战车在街上狂奔，在路上奔来奔去。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿2.4.htm">2:4</a>）<br />“战车”表真理的教义，当虚假取代真理时，经上说它“在街上狂奔”。撒迦利亚书：<br />将来必有年老的男女坐在耶路撒冷街上，城中街上必满有男孩女孩，在街上玩耍。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.4.htm">8:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.5.htm">5</a>）<br />这论及对真理的情感，因而论及欢乐与喜悦。此外还有其它经文（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.11.htm">24:11</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.1.htm">5:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.34.htm">7:34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.26.htm">49:26</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.11.htm">2:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.8.htm">4:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.14.htm">14</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.6.htm">3:6</a>）。</p>

That a "street" signifies truth, may be seen from many passages in the Word, as in John, where the New Jerusalem is treated of: </p>
<p>     The twelve gates were twelve pearls, every gate was one pearl; and 
the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass (Rev. 21:21). [2] The "New Jerusalem" is the Lord's kingdom, which, being described as to good and truth, is described by "walls," 
"gates," and "streets." By the "streets" are meant all things of truth which lead to good, or all things of faith which lead to love and charity; and because truths then become of good, thus transparent 
from good, the street is said to be "gold, as it were transparent glass." Again: </p>
<p>     In the midst of the street of it and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life, bearing twelve 
fruits (Rev. 22:2), where also the New Jerusalem or the Lord's kingdom is treated of. The "midst of the street" denotes the truth of faith, by means of which comes good, and which afterwards comes 
from good; the "twelve fruits" are what are called the fruits of faith; for "twelve" signifies all the things of faith (as shown above, n. 577, 2089, 2129-2130). [3] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     Know and perceive 
that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem, even unto Messiah the Leader, shall be seven weeks, and sixty and two weeks, and it shall be restored and built with street 
and moat (Dan. 9:25), where the Lord's advent is treated of; "it shall be restored with street and moat," denotes that there will then be what is true and good. That Jerusalem was not then restored 
and built is well known; and that it is not to be restored and built anew everyone may also know provided he does not keep his ideas fixed on a worldly kingdom, but on the heavenly kingdom that is meant 
by "Jerusalem" in the internal sense. [4] In Luke: </p>
<p>     The master of the house said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, 
the lame, and the blind (Luke 14:21). They who remain in the sense of the letter apprehend from this nothing else than that the servant should go everywhere, and that this is signified by the "streets 
and lanes;" and that he should bring in everybody, and that this is signified by the "poor, maimed, lame, and blind." But each of these words contains deep secrets within it, for they are the Lord's 
words. That he should "go into the streets and lanes," signifies that he should seek everywhere for some genuine truth, or truth which shines from good, or through which good shines. That he should 
"bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind," signifies such as were so called in the Ancient Church and were such as to the faith, but were in the life of good, who should thus be informed 
about the Lord's kingdom-thus the nations which were not yet instructed. [5] As "streets" signified truths, it was a representative rite among the Jews to teach in the streets (as appears in Matt. 
6:2, 5, and in Luke 13:26-27). In the Prophets, "streets," wherever named, signify in the internal sense either truths, or things contrary to truths, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Judgment is cast away backward, 
and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot enter (Isa. 59:14). Again: </p>
<p>     Thy sons have fainted, and have lain at the head of all the streets 
(Isa. 51:20). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces, to cut off the child from the street, the young men from the roads (Jer. 9:21). [6] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    Nebuchadnezzar shall tread down all thy streets with the hoofs of his horses (Ezek. 26:11), speaking of Tyre, by which are signified the knowledges of truth (n. 1201); the "hoofs of the horses" 
denote the memory-knowledges that pervert truth. In Nahum: </p>
<p>     The chariots rave in the streets, they run to and fro in the roads (Nah. 2:4); </p>
<p>the "chariots" denote the doctrine of truth, which 
is said to "rave in the streets," when falsity is in the place of truth. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and the streets of the city shall 
be full of boys and girls, playing in the streets (Zech. 8:4-5), speaking of the affections of truth, and the consequent gladnesses and joys. (Besides other places, as Isa. 24:11; Jer. 5:1; 7:34; 49:26; 
Lam. 2:11, 19; 4:8, 14; Zeph. 3:6). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2336</b></p><p><b>2336.</b>
That 'the street' means truth becomes clear from many places in the Word, as in John where the New Jerusalem is referred to, </p>
<blockquote>
The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate was one pearl; and the street 
of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21: 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'The New Jerusalem' is the Lord's kingdom which because it is being described as regards good and truth is described by walls, 
gates, and streets. By the last of these -'the streets' - are meant all avenues of truth which lead to good, that is, all those of faith which lead to love and charity. And because truths in this 
way become part of good, and so are made transparent from good, it is said that 'the street was pure gold, like transparent glass'. In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Out of the middle of the street of it, and of the 
river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2022:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 22: 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also refers to the New Jerusalem or the Lord's kingdom. 'The middle of the street' is the truth of faith, 
by means of which good comes and which after that stems from good. 'The twelve fruits' are those called the fruits of faith, for 'twelve' means all things of faith, as shown in <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Know and perceive that from the going forth of the Word to restore and to build Jerusalem until the Messiah, the Leader, there will be seven weeks - and sixty-two weeks; and 
it will be restored and built with street and moat. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9: 25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord, 'it will be restored with street and moat' meaning that there will be truth and good at that 
time. The fact that Jerusalem was not restored and built at that time is well known; and that it is not to be restored and built anew anyone may also know provided he does not fix his ideas on a worldly 
kingdom but on a heavenly kingdom meant in the internal sense by Jerusalem. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
The householder said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in 
here the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2014:-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 14:-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>People who confine themselves to the sense of the letter gain nothing more from this verse than the idea that the servant was to go 
everywhere, and that this is what is meant by 'streets and lanes', and that he was to fetch in everybody, and that this is what is meant by 'the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind'. But each 
and all of these words, being the Lord's, embody arcana within them. The command that he should go out into the streets and lanes means that he was to search everywhere for some genuine truth, that is, 
for truth which shines out of good, or through which good shines. The command that he should bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind, means that such people were to be brought in as had 
in the Ancient Church been called the poor, maimed, lame, or blind - that is, he was to bring in those who were such as regards faith but who had led good lives, and who for this reason ought to be 
taught about the Lord's kingdom - thus to bring in gentiles who were as yet uninformed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Because 'streets' meant truths it was a representative custom among the Jews to teach in the streets, as 
is evident from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%206:%202,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 6: 2, 5</a>, and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:-26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:-26, 27</a>. Wherever 'streets' are mentioned in the Prophets they mean in the internal sense either truths or things contrary to truths, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Judgement 
is cast away backwards, and justice stands afar off, for truth has stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot come in. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Your sons fainted and lay at the 
head of every street. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51: 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Death has come up into our windows, it has entered our palaces, cutting off the small child from the street and the young men from the lanes. Jer. 
9: <a href="21.htm">21</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
By means of the hoofs of his horses Nebuchadnezzar will trample all your streets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2026:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 26: 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means cognitions of truth, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. 'The hoofs 
of the horses' are facts which pervert the truth. In Nahum, </p>
<blockquote>
In the streets the chariots rage; they rush about in the lanes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum%202:-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Nahum 2:-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Chariots' stands for the doctrine of truth, which is said 
'to rage in the streets' when falsity has replaced truth. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem. And the streets of the city will be full of boys and 
girls playing in the streets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%208:%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 8: 4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This refers to affections for truth, and consequent forms of joy and gladness. There are other places besides these, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24: 11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%205:%201;%207:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 5: 1; 7:</a>

</p><b>2336.</b>
Quod `platea' significet verum, constare potest a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut apud Johannem ubi de Nova Hierosolymam, 	Duodecim portae, duodecim margaritae, unaquaevis porta erat margarita una, et 
platea civitatis aurum purum sicut {1} vitrum pellucidum, Apoc. xxi 21; </p>
<p>[2] `Nova Hierosolymam' est regnum Domini, quod quia describitur quoad bonum et verum, describitur per muros, portas, plateas; 
per has, nempe per `plateas,' intelliguntur omnia veli quae ducunt ad bonum, seu omnia fidei quae ducant ad amorem et charitatem, et quia vera tunc fiunt boni, ita pellucentia a bono, dicitur `platea 
aurum quasi vitrum pellucidum': apud eundem, 	E medio plateae ejus et fluvii, hic illic arbor vitae faciens fructus duodecim, Apoc. xxii 2; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de Nova Hierosolyma seu regno Domini; `medium plateae' 
est verum fidei, per quod bonum et quod dein a bono: `fructus duodecim' sunt qui vocantur fructus fidei, nam `duodecim' significant omnia fidei, ut ostensum n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130 [3] apud Danielem, 	Scito 
et percipito, ab exitu Verbi ad restituendum et ad aedificandum Hierosolymam, usque ad Messiam Ducem, septimanae septem, et septimanae sexaginta {2} et duae, et restituetur et aedificabitur 
platea et fossa, ix 25; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini; quod `restituetur platea et fossa' est quod tunc verum et bonum; quod Hierosolyma tunc non restituenda sit et aedificata, notum est, et quod non restituenda 
et aedificanda denuo, quisque etiam nosse potest, si non detineat ideas in regno mundano, sed in regno caelesti per `Hierosolymam' in sensu interno intellecto: [4] apud Lucam, 	Paterfamilias 
dixit servo suo, Abi ocius in plateas et vicos urbis, et pauperes, mancos, claudos et caecos introduc illuc, xiv 21; </p>
<p>qui manent in sensu litterae, non aliud inde capiunt quam quod (o)servus iret ubivis, 
et quod hoc significetur per plateas et vicos; quodque adduceret quoscumque, et quod hoc significetur per pauperes, mancos, claudos et caecos; sed singula verba involvunt arcana, sunt enim Domini; 
`quod iret in plateas et vicos' significat quod quaereret ubicumque aliquod veram genuinum, (o)seu verum quod lucet ex bono, seu {3} per quod pellucet bonum; quod `introduceret pauperes, mancos, claudos 
et caecos' significat quod tales qui in Antiqua Ecclesia ita vocati sunt, et tales fuerunt quoad fidem, sed in vita boni, qui sic informarentur de regno Domini, ita gentes quae nondum instructae: 
[5] quia `plateae' significabant vera, inde ritus repraesentativus apud Judaeos, docere in plateis, ut patet apud Matthaeum vi 2, 5; et apud Lucam xiii 26, 27: apud Prophetas `plateae,' ubicumque nominantur: 
in sensu interno significant vel vera, vel contraria veris, ut apud Esaiam: </p>
<p>	Rejectum est retro judicium, et justitia e longinquo stetit, nam impegit in platea veritas, et rectitudo non potest 
advenire lix 14: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Filii tui defecerunt, et jacuerunt in capite omnium platearum li 20: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Ascendit mors in fenestras {4}, venit in palatia nostra, ad exscindendum parvulum 
e platea, juvenes e vicis, ix 20: </p>
<p>[6] apud Ezechielem, 	Nebuchadnezzar per ungulas equorum suorum conculcabit omnes plateas tuas, xxvi 11; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro, per quam cognitiones veri significantur, 
n. 1201; `ungulae equorum' sunt scientifica pervertentia verum: apud Nahum, 	In plateis insaniunt currus, discurrunt in vicis, ii 5; </p>
<p>`currus' pro doctrina veri, qui `insanire in plateis' dicitur 
quando falsum loco veri: apud Zachariam, 	Adhuc habitabunt senes mares, et senes mulieres in plateis Hierosolymae,... et plateae civitatis implebuntur pueris et puellis, ludentibus in plateis, viii 4, 
5; </p>
<p>de affectionibus veri, et inde laetitiis et gaudiis: praeter alibi, ut Esai. xxiv 11; Jer. v 1; vii 34; xlix 26; Thren. ii 11, 19; iv 8, 14; Zeph. iii. 6. 	@1 quasi.$ 	@2 septuaginta AI, but in
