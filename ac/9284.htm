<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9284节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9284.</strong>“也不可从你口中听到”表不可顺从它们，或以任何方式肯定它们。这从“听”和“不从口中”的含义清楚可知：“听”是指顺从（参看<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>，<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>，<a href="7216.htm">7216</a>，<a href="8361.htm">8361</a>节）；“不从口中”当论及“别神的名”所表示的虚假教义时，是指不可肯定。别神的名之所以不可提，也不可从口中听到，是为了所吩咐的一切律例、典章和诫命可以代表天上的事物和主的神性事物；只要他们说耶和华的名并拜祂，这些事物就被代表了；因为那时，主的神性之物，以及与祂同在的天堂就会同在。但当他们说别神的名并拜他们时，地狱之物就被代表，因为那时，来自地狱、想要被拜为神的灵人会同在。这是地狱里的人无休止的渴望，因为对自我和世界的爱在那里掌权（<a href="3881.htm">3881</a>e节）。</p>

And it shall not be heard upon thy mouth. That this signifies that obedience is not to be paid with any affirmation, is evident from the signification of "hearing," as being to obey (see n. 2542, 3869, 
4652-4660, 5017, 7216, 8361); and from the signification of "not being upon the mouth," when said of the doctrine of falsity which is signified by "the name of other gods," as being not to affirm. 
The reason why the name of other gods was not to be mentioned, nor to be heard upon the mouth, was that heavenly things, and the Divine things of the Lord, might be represented by all the statutes, judgments, 
and commandments that were commanded; and they were represented so long as Jehovah was named and worshiped, for then the Divine of the Lord was present, and heaven with Him. But when other gods 
were named and worshiped, infernal things were represented, because spirits from the hells were then present who wished to be worshiped as gods; for those who are in the hells are continually seeking 
this, because the loves of self and of the world reign there (n. 3881). </p>

'It shall not be heard on your lips' means that they should not obey them or in any way affirm them. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing' as obeying, dealt with in <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>, <a href="5017.htm">5017</a>, <a href="7216.htm">7216</a>, <a href="8361.htm">8361</a>; and from the meaning of 'not being on the lips' - when it refers to teachings that present what is false, meant by 'the name of other gods' - as not affirming. The reason why the name of 
other gods was not to be mentioned or to be heard on their lips was in order that heavenly and Divine things which were the Lord's might be represented by all the statutes, judgements, and commandments 
that were decreed. And those things were indeed represented as long as they uttered Jehovah's name and worshipped Him; for then what was Divine and the Lord's was present, and heaven with Him. But when 
they uttered the name of other gods and worshipped them hellish things were represented, for spirits from hell were present, who wished to be worshipped as gods. This is the unceasing desire of those 
in hell, because self-love and love of the world reign there, see <a href="3881.htm">3881</a> (end).  </p>

`Non audietur super ore tuo': quod significet quod non oboediendum ulla affirmatione, constat ex significatione `audire' quod sit oboedire, de qua n. 2542, 3869, 4652, 4660, 5017, 7216, 8361, et ex significatione 
`non super ore esse' cum de doctrina falsi, quae significatur per `nomen deorum aliorum,' quod sit non affirmare.  Quod nomen deorum aliorum non memorandum esset, nec audiendum super ore, 
erat ob causam ut repraesentarentur caelestia ac Divina Domini per omnia statuta, judicia, et praecepta quae mandata sunt; repraesentabantur etiam quamdiu {1} Jehovam nominabant et colebant, tunc enim 
aderat Divinum Domini, et cum {2} Illo caelum; at cum nominabant et colebant alios deos, tunc repraesentabantur infernalia, nam spiritus ab infernis aderant, qui pro diis coli volebant; id enim (o)illi 
qui in infernis sunt, continuo {3} ambiunt, quoniam amores sui et mundi ibi regnant, videatur n. 3881 fin. @1 i solum$ @2 in$ @3 continue$ </p>
