<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4756节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4756.</strong>“有些米甸人，就是作生意的商人从那里经过”表那些处于该良善的真理之人。这从“米甸人”和“商人”的含义清楚可知：“米甸人”是指那些处于简单良善的人（参看<a href="3242.htm">3242</a>节）；“商人”是指那些拥有对良善与真理的认知之人，因为这类认知在灵义由“财富”、“财物”和“货物”来表示。因此，“作生意”是指获得并传播这些认知（<a href="2967.htm">2967</a>，<a href="4453.htm">4453</a>节）。此处并非表示对良善的认知，而表示对真理的认知，因“米甸人”表示那些处于简单良善的真理之人，如前所述。由于同样的原因，他们被称为“人”，因为那些拥有真理的人就被称为人（<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>，<a href="3309.htm">3309</a>节）。从此处所描述的一系列历史事件明显可知，约瑟被卖给了以实玛利人，但却被米甸人从坑里拉上来的，也是被米甸人卖给埃及的波提乏；因为在本章最后一节，经上说“米甸人把约瑟卖到埃及，给法老的内臣、护卫长波提乏”。有人可能以为，既然约瑟被卖给了以实玛利人，那么在埃及卖他的，就是以实玛利人，而不是被米甸人。但事情这样方式是为了包含在内义中的事物的代表。因为“约瑟”，也就是神性真理，不可能被那些处于良善的人卖掉，只能被那些处于该良善的真理之人卖掉。其原因可见于本章最后一节的解释。</p>

And there passed by, men, Midianites, merchantmen. That this signifies those who are in the truth of this good, is evident from the representation of the Midianites, as being those who are in the truth 
of simple good (see n. 3242); and from the signification of "merchantmen," as being those who have the knowledges of good and truth; for these in the spiritual sense are "riches," "wealth," and "merchandise." 
Hence "to trade" is to procure and to communicate these knowledges (n. 2967, 4453). Here it is not the knowledges of good that are signified, but the knowledges of truth; for the "Midianites" 
are those who are in the truth of simple good, as before said; and from this also they are called "men" [viri], for those are so called who are in truth (n. 3134, 3309). From the historical series 
it is evident that Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites, but that he was drawn out of the pit by the Midianites, and was also sold by the Midianites in Egypt to Potiphar, for in the last verse of this 
chapter it is said, "and the Midianites sold him to Egypt unto Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain." It may be supposed that as Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites, he was sold in Egypt by them, and not by 
the Midianites; but still this was brought to pass for the sake of the representation of the things in the internal sense; for Joseph (that is, Divine truth) cannot be sold by those who are in good, 
but by those who are in the truth of this good. The reason will be seen in the explication of the last verse of this chapter. </p>

'And men passed by, Midianites, who were traders' means those in whom the truth partnering that good is present. This is clear from the representation of 'Midianites' as those in whom the truth that 
partners simple good is present, dealt with in <a href="3242.htm">3242</a>; and from the meaning of 'traders' as those who possess cognitions of good and truth, for such cognitions are meant by riches, wealth, and wares in 
the spiritual sense, and therefore 'trading' means acquiring and communicating these cognitions, <a href="2967.htm">2967</a>, <a href="4453.htm">4453</a>. Here not cognitions of good but those of truth are meant, for, as stated above, 'Midianites' 
means those in whom the truth that partners simple good is present. For the same reason they are called 'men', since the expression 'men' is used of those who possess truth, <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, <a href="3309.htm">3309</a>. From the historical 
chain of events described here it is plain that Joseph was sold to Ishmaelites, but that he was drawn out of the pit by Midianites and was also sold by the Midianites to Potiphar in Egypt; for 
it is said in the final verse of this chapter, 'And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's bedchamber-servant'. One would think that because Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites that 
these, not the Midianites, would be the ones to sell him in Egypt. But things happened the way they did for the sake of the representation of what is contained in the internal sense. 'Joseph', that is, 
Divine Truth, cannot be sold by those governed by good, only by those governed by the truth partnering that good. The reason for this will be seen in the explanation of the final verse of this chapter. </p>

`Et transiverunt viri Midianitae negotiatores': quod significet illos qui in vero illius boni, constat ex repraesentatione `Midianitarum' quod sint qui in vero simplicis boni, de qua n. 3242; et 
ex significatione `negotiatorum' quod sint {1} qui habent cognitiones boni et veri, (o)hae enim sunt divitiae, opes et merces in sensu spirituali, inde negotiari {2} est cognitiones illas sibi comparare 
et communicare, n. 2967, 4453; hic non cognitiones boni sed veri significantur {3}, nam `Midianitae' sunt qui in vero simplicis boni, ut supra dictum; inde etiam vocantur viri, `viri' enim dicuntur 
qui in vero, n. 3134, 3309 pr.  Ex serie historica hic liquet quod Josephus venditus sit Jishmaelitis, at quod extractus (c)e fovea a Midianitis, et quoque a Midianitis venditus in Aegypto Potiphari; 
in versu enim ultimo hujus capitis dicitur, `Et Midianitae vendiderunt eum ad Aegyptum Potiphari cubiculario Pharaonis'; autumari potest quia Josephus venditus est Jishmaelitis, quod ab his, 
non autem a Midianitis, venditus esset in Aegypto; sed usque ita factum est causa repraesentationis rerum quae in sensu interno, nam `Josephus,' hoc est, Divinum Verum, non vendi potest ab illis 
qui in bono sunt, sed ab illis qui in vero illius boni; causa videbitur in explicatione versus ultimi hujus capitis {4}.      @1 i illi$      @2 i enim in sensu interno$      @3 hic qui habent
