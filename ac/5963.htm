<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5963节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5963.</strong>“他又对他们说，你们不要在路上相争”表赋予他们的觉知，即他们要和平共处。这从“对他们说”和“不要在路上相争”的含义清楚可知：“对他们说”是指内在，即“约瑟”（如前面频繁所述）所赋予的一种觉知；“不要在路上相争”是指他们要和平共处。事实上，与他人相争就是不和平，因为这是一种低级心智的扰乱。刚才（<a href="5962.htm">5962</a>节）所提到的来世的不同状态就取决于那里的人当中对良善与真理的觉知，因而取决于他们对主同在的觉知。这种觉知决定了他们享有和平的程度；因为那些对主的同在拥有一种觉知的人也拥有这样一种觉知：发生在他们身上的每一件事都有利于他们自己的福祉，并且邪恶不会触及他们。这就是那赋予他们所享有的和平的东西。没有对主的这种信仰或信靠，没有人能获得这种和平，因而获得喜悦所带来的幸福，因为这幸福就居于这种和平之中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5963</b></p><p><b>5963.</b>
And he said unto them, Contend not in the way. That this signifies a perception given that they should be in tranquillity, is evident from the signification of "saying unto them," as being a perception 
given by the internal, which is "Joseph" (of which often above); and from the signification of "not contending in the way," as being to be in tranquillity; for contention with others is intranquillity, 
because it is a disturbance of the lower mind. The varying states in the other life of which mention has been made just above (n. 5962), are according to the perception of good and truth with those 
who are there, thus according to their perception of the Lord's presence. According to this perception they have tranquillity; for they who are in the perception of the Lord's presence are in the perception 
that each and all things which befall them tend to their good, and that evils do not reach them; hence they are in tranquillity. Without such faith or confidence in the Lord no one can possibly 
come to the tranquillity of peace, thus neither to the bliss in joy, because this bliss dwells in the tranquillity of peace. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5963</b></p><p><b>5963.</b>
'And he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way' means the perception imparted to them that they should be at peace. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying to them' as a perception imparted by the 
internal, which is 'Joseph', dealt with often; and from the meaning of 'not quarreling on the way' as that they should be at peace. For quarreling with others is an absence of peace because there is 
disturbance of mind. The varying states in the next life, which are referred to immediately above in <a href="5962.htm">5962</a>, are determined by the perception of goodness and truth among those there, and so by their perception 
of the Lord's presence. That perception determines the degree of peace they enjoy, for those who have a perception of the Lord's presence also have a perception that every single thing that happens 
to them is conducive to their own welfare and that no evil influences can reach them. This is what gives them the peace they enjoy. Without such faith or trust in the Lord no one can ever attain 
that peace, nor accordingly the bliss which joy brings since that bliss resides within such peace. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5963</b>
</p><b>5963.</b>
`Et dixit ad illos, Ne contendatis in via': quod significet perceptionem datam ut in tranquillo sint, constat ex significatione `dicere ad illos' quod sit perceptio {1}data ab interno quod est `Joseph', 
de qua saepius; et a significatione `non contendere in via' quod sit ut in tranquillo sint; contentio enim cum aliis est intranquillum, quia est turba animi. Status qui variantur in altera vita, 
de quibus mox supra n. (x)5962, se habent secundum perceptionem boni et veri apud illos, ita secundum perceptionem praesentiae Domini {2}; secundum perceptionem illam est illis tranquillum, nam qui in 
perceptione praesentiae Domini sunt, illi in perceptione sunt quod omnia et singula quae illis contingunt, ad bonum eorum tendant, et quod mala {3}ad illos non pertingant, inde sunt in tranquillo; (m)absque 
tali fide seu confidentia in Dominum, nusquam aliquis venire potest ad tranquillum pacis, ita nec ad beatum in gaudio, quia {4}beatum illud in tranquillo pacis habitat.(n) @1 after Joseph$ @2 
i apud illos$ @3 nec ad illos$ @4 hoc$ </p>
