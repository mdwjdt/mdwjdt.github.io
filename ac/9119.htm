<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9119节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9119.</strong>人有一个良善的良心和一个公正的良心。良善的良心就是内在人的良心；公正的良心则是外在人的良心。良善的良心在于出于内在情感照着信之戒律行事；而公正的良心在于出于外在情感照着文明道德的法律行事。那些拥有一个良善的良心之人也拥有一个公正的良心；但那些只有一个公正的良心之人则拥有获得一个良善良心的能力，而且在接受教导之后，也的确获得它。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9119</b></p><p><b>9119.</b>
Man has a Conscience of what is good, and a Conscience of what is just. The Conscience of what is good is the Conscience of the internal man; and the Conscience of what is just is the Conscience of the 
external man. The Conscience of what is good consists in acting according to the precepts of faith from internal affection; while the Conscience of what is just consists in acting according to civil 
and moral laws from external affection. They who have a Conscience of what is good, have also a Conscience of what is just; but they who have only a Conscience of what is just, have the capacity of 
receiving a Conscience of what is good, and moreover do receive it when they are instructed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9119</b></p><p><b>9119.</b>
Human conscience involves a sense of what is good or a sense of what is right. A sense of what is good is conscience as it exists with the internal man, while a sense of what is right is conscience as 
it exists with the external man. The sense of what is good consists in being moved by an inward affection to act in accordance with what faith prescribes, whereas the sense of what is right consists 
in being moved by an outward affection to act in accordance with civil and moral laws. Those having a sense of what is good have as well a sense of what is right; but those having merely a sense of what 
is right possess the ability to acquire a sense of what is good, and do also acquire it after instruction.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9119</b>
</p><b>9119.</b>
Est homini conscientia boni et conscientia justi; conscientia boni est conscientia interni hominis, et conscientia justi est conscientia externi hominis; conscientia boni est facere secundum praecepta 
fidei ex affectione interna, at conscientia justi est facere secundum leges civiles et morales ex affectione externa.  Qui conscientiam boni habent, illi quoque conscientiam justi habent, at qui modo 
conscientiam justi habent, illi in facultate sunt recipiendi conscientiam boni, et quoque recipiunt cum instructi. </p>
