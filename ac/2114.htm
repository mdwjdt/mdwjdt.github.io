<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2114节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2114.</strong>“家里所有的人，无论是在家里生的，是用银子买的”表那时所有那些教会中人。这从“在家里生的”和“用银子买的”含义清楚可知：“在家里生的”是指那些属天之人，“用银子买的”是指属灵之人（对此，参看<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2052.htm">2052</a>节）。那里还说明，他们是教会中人，因为所有教会中人，即构成教会的所有人要么是属天的，要么是属灵的。至于谁是属天之人，谁是属灵之人，可参看前文（<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>节）。本章这最后一节概括了前面所有内容，也就是说，那些洁除我欲和物欲的人，既包括那些教会中人，也包括那些教会外的人，他们都因主称义。这两类人都被称作“家人”，因为就内义而言，“家”表主的国度（<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节）。</p>

All the men of his house, he that was born in the house, and he that was bought with silver. That this signifies all those who are within the church, is evident from the signification of "him that was 
born in the house," as being the celestial; and from the signification of "those bought with silver," as being the spiritual (concerning which above, n. 2048, 2051, 2052); and also that these are they 
who are within the church, for all who are within the church, that is, all who constitute the church, are either celestial or spiritual; but who the celestial and who the spiritual are, may be seen 
above (n. 2088). In this last verse of this chapter there is a summary of all that has been said above, namely, that they who have been purified from the loves of self and of the world, both those within 
the church and those outside the church, are justified by the Lord. Both these classes are called the "men of the house;" for in the internal sense "the house" signifies the Lord's kingdom (n. 2048). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2114</b></p><p><b>2114.</b>
That 'all the men of his house, he that was born in the house and he that was the purchase of silver' means all those at that time inside the Church is clear from meaning of those 'born in the house' 
as celestial people, and from the meaning of 'those purchased with silver' as spiritual people, dealt with above in <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2052.htm">2052</a>. The fact that they are people inside the Church has also been stated 
in those paragraphs, for all who are inside the Church, that is, all who constitute the Church, are either celestial or spiritual. But who exactly are celestial and who spiritual, see above in <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>. 
This final verse of this chapter sums up all that has been stated above, namely that those who have been purified from self-love and love of the world, those inside the Church and also those outside, 
are made righteous by the Lord. Both groups of people are called 'men of the house' because 'house' in the internal sense means the Lord's kingdom, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>. </p>

</p><b>2114.</b>
Quod `omnes viri domus ejus, natus domus, et emptio argenti' significet quod tunc omnes illi qui intra Ecclesiam, constat a significatione `nati domus' quod sint caelestes: et a significatione `emptorum 
argento' quod sint spirituales, de quibus {1} supra n. 2048, 2051, 2052; et quod illi sint qui intra Ecclesiam, ibi etiam dictum; omnes enim qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, hoc est, omnes qui Ecclesiam 
constituunt, sunt vel caelestes vel spirituales; quinam autem caelestes et quinam spirituales sunt, videatur supra n. 2088. In ultimo hoc versu hujus capitis, est summarium omnium quae supra dicta sunt, 
nempe quod qui purificati sunt ab amoribus sui et mundi, tam qui intra Ecclesiam (x)quam qui extra Ecclesiam, sint justificati a Domino; illi et hi vocantur `viri domus,' nam `domus' in sensu interno 
significat regnum Domini, n. 2048. 	@1 qua.$ </p>
