<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3192节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3192.</strong>“仆人就带着利百加走了”表属世的神圣良善实施引入。这从“仆人”和“带着利百加走了”的含义清楚可知：“仆人”是指属世的神圣良善，如前所述（<a href="3184.htm">3184</a>节）；“带着利百加走了”是指引入，也就是带给“以撒”，而“以撒”就是理性中的神圣良善，这是显而易见的，无需进一步解释。其中的情形是这样：出于属世人的真理若不通过属世的神圣真理和属世的神圣良善，就无法被提升到理性人中的良善。被称为“那人”的属世神圣真理必须指出道路并引领；而被称为“仆人”的属世神圣良善则必须从属世人中带来真理，并将其引入理性人里面的良善中。打个比方说，它们就像两个翅膀，将具有这两个翅膀的人提起来。这些问题无法在此更充分或更理性地展开解释。首先必须知道何为属世的神圣真理，何为属世的神圣良善。就内义而言，这些就是后面以约瑟为主题的章节所论述的主题。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3192</b></p><p><b>3192.</b>
And the servant took Rebekah and went away. That this signifies that Divine good natural effected the initiation, is evident from the signification of the "servant," as being Divine good natural (as 
above, n. 3184); and from the signification of "taking Rebekah and going away," as being to initiate, that is, to introduce to Isaac; that is, to Divine good in the rational; as may appear without further 
explication. The case herein is this: Truth out of the natural could not be elevated to good in the rational, except through Divine truth and Divine good, both natural; Divine truth natural, which 
is called the "man," must show the way and lead; Divine good natural, which is called the "servant," must introduce and initiate. To speak comparatively, these are as two wings which uplift. But these 
things cannot as yet be more fully unfolded to the apprehension; for it must first be known what Divine truth natural is, and what Divine good natural, which subjects are treated of in the internal 
sense in the following chapters concerning Joseph. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3192</b></p><p><b>3192.</b>
'And the servant took Rebekah and went' means that natural Divine Good did the introducing. This is clear from the meaning of 'the servant' as natural Divine Good, as above in <a href="3184.htm">3184</a>, and from the meaning 
of 'taking Rebekah and going' as introducing, that is to say, bringing to 'Isaac', who is the Divine Good in the Rational, as becomes clear without further explanation. The implications of this are 
that truth from the natural could not be raised up to good in the rational except by means of natural Divine Truth and natural Divine Good. Natural Divine Truth, which is called 'the man', was to point 
the way and lead; natural Divine Good, which is referred to as 'the servant', was to bring truth from the natural and introduce it to the good in the rational. To use a comparison, they are like two 
wings which raise up the possessor of them. These matters cannot be explained any more fully or intelligibly here. One must first know what natural Divine Truth is, and what natural Divine Good is; 
and these are referred to later on in the internal sense where Joseph is the subject. </p>

`Et accepit servus Rebeccam et ivit': quod significet quod Divinum Bonum naturale initiaret, constat (c)a significatione `servi' quod sit Divinum Bonum naturale, ut supra n. 3184, et a significatione 
`accipere Rebeccam et ire' quod sit initiare, nempe introducere ad `Jishakum,' hoc est, ad Divinum Bonum in Rationali, ut constare potest absque ulteriore explicatione. Res ita se habet: verum e naturali 
ad bonum in rationali non potuit elevari, nisi per Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum, utrumque naturale; {1}Divinum Verum naturale, quod `vir' dictum, viam monstrabit ac ducet, Divinum Bonum naturale, 
quod `servus' vocatur, introducet et initiabit; sunt illa, ut comparative dicatur, sicut binae alae quae elevant: sed haec {2}plenius ad captum adhuc non possunt explicari, sciendum {3}prius erit 
quid Divinum Verum naturale, et quid Divinum Bonum naturale: in sequentibus, ubi de Josepho, de illis in sensu interno agitur. @1 per Divinum Verum naturale quod viam monstret ac ducat, et per Divinum 
bonum naturale, quod introducat initiet;$  @2 plene$  @3 i enim$  </p>
