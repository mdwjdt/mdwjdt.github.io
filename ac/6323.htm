<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6323节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6323.</strong>从主经由天使所流入的爱之良善包含所有真理，如果人过着爱主爱邻的生活，真理会自然而然地显现。这一点不仅从天堂所发生的事，还从低下的自然界所发生的事明显看出来。因为自然界的事物是可观察的，我可以举其中一些例子来说明这个问题。<br />动物只受它们被造、后来又生在其中的爱和这些爱的情感，而非其它东西驱使；因为每个动物都被带向它的情感和爱所吸引它的方向。正因如此，动物还拥有属于那爱的一切知识。因为它们出于一种类似婚姻之爱的爱知道如何交配，牲畜有牲畜的方式，鸟类有鸟类的方式。鸟类知道如何筑巢、产蛋，并卧在它们上面，孵化它们的幼雏，知道如何喂养它们。它们知道这一切，无需任何教导，仅靠一种类似婚姻之爱的爱和一种对后代的爱，这些爱拥有植入在它们里面的一切知识。它们同样知道什么东西可以当食物吃，如何找到它们。更神奇的是，蜜蜂知道如何从各种鲜花中寻觅食物，也知道如何收集造蜂室所用的蜂蜡；它们先是把后代安置在这些蜂室中，然后在里面储存食物。它们还知道如何为过冬作准备；更不用提其它许多事了。所有这些知识就包含在它们的爱中，并且从一开始就住在那里。生物就出生在这些知识中，因为它们存在于属其真实本性，并且它们被造所进入的秩序中；此后，它们被来自灵界的一种总体流注所驱使。<br />人若活在他被造所进入的秩序中，也就是活在爱邻爱主之中（因为这些爱适合人类，是人类所特有的），那么生来就比所有动物都优越，不仅生在知识中，还生在一切属灵真理和一切属天良善，因而生在一切智慧和聪明之中。因为人能思想主，能通过爱与主结合，从而被提升至神性和永恒之物，而这对动物来说是不可能的。因此，他若活在自己真正的秩序中，就会唯独由从主经由灵界而来的总体流注所指引。但是，他并未生在其真正的秩序中，而是生来就违反自己的秩序，所以生来就完全没有知识。正因如此，主才会规定：他以后可以重生，以这种方式照着他自由接受良善，并通过良善接受真理的程度而进入聪明和智慧。</p>

That within the good of love which flows in from the Lord through angels is all truth, which truth would become manifest of itself if man lived in love to the Lord and in love toward the neighbor, is 
evident not only from the things that take place in heaven, but also from those which take place in lower nature; and from the latter, because they are in plain sight, I may draw some illustrations. [2] 
Brute animals are impelled to action in no other way than by means of the loves and the affections of these into which they have been created and afterward born; for every animal is carried whither 
his affection and love draw it; and this being so, they are also in all matters of knowledge that ever belong to their love; for they know from a love resembling conjugial love how to come together, 
cattle after their kind, and birds after their kind; birds know how to build their nests, lay their eggs, brood upon them, hatch their young, and how to feed them, and this without any instruction, 
merely from the love which resembles conjugial love, and from love toward their offspring, which loves have implanted in them all these matters of knowledge. In like manner they know what things to eat 
for food, and how to seek them. And, what is more wonderful, bees know how to seek their food from flowers of various kinds, and also to gather the wax with which they make their cells, wherein first 
they deposit their offspring, and then store up food; they also know how to provide for the winter; not to mention very many other things. All these matters of knowledge are included in their loves, 
and dwell there from their earliest origin. Into these they are born, because they are in the order of their nature into which they were created; and thereafter they are moved by a general influx from 
the spiritual world. [3] If man were in the order into which he was created, namely, in love toward the neighbor, and in love to the Lord (for these loves are proper to man), he above all animals would 
be born not only into matters of knowledge, but also into all spiritual truths and celestial goods, and thus into all wisdom and intelligence; for he is able to think of the Lord, and to be conjoined 
with Him through love, and thus to be elevated to what is Divine and eternal, which is not possible to brute animals. Thus in the supposed case man would be directed by no other than general influx 
from the Lord through the spiritual world. But as he is not born into order, but contrary to his order, he is therefore born into ignorance of all things; and for this reason it has been provided that 
he may afterward be reborn, and thus come into as much of intelligence and wisdom as he receives of good, and of truth through good, in freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6323</b></p><p><b>6323.</b>
The good of love which flows in from the Lord through angels contains all truth, and truth would reveal itself spontaneously if the human being led a life of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. 
This is evident not only from things that obtain in heaven but also from those in the natural order beneath. Since the things in the natural order are observable, let some be brought forward to 
illustrate the matter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Animals are propelled by nothing else than the loves and accompanying affections into which they have been created and afterwards born; for every animal is carried in the 
direction its affection and love take it. That being so, animals also have all the knowledge that ever accompanies that love. For they know from a love resembling the love that belongs to marriage 
how they are to mate, cattle in one way, birds in another. Birds know how they must build nests, lay eggs and sit on them, how they must hatch chicks and feed them. They know these things without any 
instruction, solely from a love resembling that which belongs to marriage and from a love for offspring, which loves have all that knowledge implanted in them. Similarly they know which food they must 
eat and how they must look for it. More than that, bees know how to look for food in flowers of various kinds, and also to gather wax to make cells with, in which first they place their offspring and 
after that store food. They also know how to make provision for the winter, not to mention many other things. All this knowledge is included in their loves and resides in them right from the start. Creatures 
are born into that knowledge because they exist in the order which belongs to their true nature and into which they have been created; and as such they are driven by a general inflow from the 
spiritual world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 If the human being were living in the order into which he was created - that is to say, in love towards the neighbour and in love to the Lord, for these loves are peculiar to 
the human being - he would be born, pre-eminently all animals, not only into knowledge but also into all spiritual truths over and all celestial forms of good, thus into all wisdom and intelligence. For 
the human being is able to think about the Lord and to be joined to Him through love, and so to be raised up to what is Divine and eternal, which animals cannot be. Thus if he were living in his true 
order he would be governed solely by general influx from the Lord through the spiritual world. But because he is not born into his true order but into one contrary to it, he is born totally without 
knowledge. This being so, provision has been made so that he can be born again and in that way enter into intelligence and wisdom, in the same measure as he embraces good in freedom, and truth through good.  </p>

</p><b>6323.</b>
Quod in amoris bono quod influit a Domino per angelos, insit omne verum, {1} quod verum se ex se manifestaret si homo in amore in Dominum et in amore erga proximum viveret, patet non modo ab illis quae 
in caelo existunt sed etiam ab illis quae in inferiore natura; ex his quae in inferiore natura existunt, quia in conspectu sunt, licet adducere quae illustrant:  [2]bruta animalia non aliter aguntur 
quam per amores et horum affectiones in quas creata sunt, et postmodum {2}nascuntur; unumquodlibet enim animal fertur quo ejus affectio et amor trahit; et quia ita est, etiam sunt in omnibus scientificis 
quae usquam illius amoris sunt; sciunt enim ex amore conjugialis aemulo quomodo congressuri, ita pecora, et aliter aves; aves quomodo nidos facient, quomodo ova ponent, et illis incubabunt, quomodo 
excludent pullos et quomodo alent illos, et haec absque ulla instructione, solum ex amore {3} conjugialis aemulo, et ex amore erga prolem, qui in se omnia illa scientifica habent insita; similiter 
sciunt quibus cibis se alent, quomodo illos quaerent; et quod magis, apes sciunt quaerere illos ex floribus varii generis, et quoque ceram colligere ex qua cellas faciant, in quibus primum sobolem suam 
reponant et dein cibos recondant, {4} quoque sciunt prospicere sibi pro hieme; ut taceantur perplura alia; omnia haec scientifica sunt inclusa eorum amoribus, et ibi habitant a sua prima origine; 
in illa scientifica nascuntur quia in ordine suae naturae sunt in quem creati; et tunc ex communi influxu e spirituali mundo aguntur.  [3]Si homo in ordine foret in quem creatus, nempe in amore erga proximum 
et in amore in Dominum, nam hi amores sunt homini proprii, ille prae omnibus animalibus nasceretur non modo in scientifica sed etiam in vera omnia spiritualia et bona caelestia, et ita in omnem 
sapientiam et intelligentiam, nam is potest cogitare de Domino, ac Ipsi conjungi per amorem, ac sic elevari ad Divinum et aeternum, quod non possunt bruta animalia; {5}ita homo tunc non nisi quam a 
communi influxu (c)a Domino per spiritualem mundum regeretur; sed quia non in ordinem sed contra ordinem suum nascitur, ideo nascitur in ignorantiam omnium; et quia ita, provisum est ut {6}dein possit 
renasci, et sic venire in tantum intelligentiae et sapientiae quantum boni et quantum veri per bonum ex libero recipit. @1 i et$ @2 nata, unumquodvis$ @3 i illo$ @4 i et $ @5 et tunc is$ @6 deinde$ </p>
