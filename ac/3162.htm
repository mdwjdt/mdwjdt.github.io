Verses 52-54. And it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah. And the servant brought forth vessels of silver and vessels of gold, 
and garments, and gave to Rebekah; he gave also precious things to her brother and to her mother. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him; and they passed the night; and they rose 
up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my lord. "And it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah," signifies a perception 
of joy in the natural man; "and the servant brought forth vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments," signifies truth and good, and their adornments; "and gave to Rebekah," signifies which 
then were for the affection of truth; "he gave also precious things to her brother," signifies spiritual things thence for natural good; "and to her mother," signifies for natural truth also; "and they 
did eat and drink," signifies the appropriation of good and of truth thus initiated; "he and the men that were with him," signifies which are in the natural man; "and they passed the night," signifies 
its peace; "and they rose up in the morning," signifies a degree of elevation; "and he said, Send me away unto my lord," signifies the affection of conjunction. </p>

Verses 52-54 And so it was, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth to Jehovah. And the servant brought out vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments, and 
gave them to Rebekah; and he gave precious things to her brother and to her mother. And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed the night; and they rose up in the morning, and 
he said, Send me to my master. </p>
<p>'So it was, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth to Jehovah' means the perception of joy in the natural man. 'And the servant brought 
out vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments' means truth and good, and the adornment of these. 'And gave them to Rebekah' means which passed at that point to the affection for truth. 
'And he gave precious things to her brother' means spiritual things passing from there to natural good. 'And to her mother' means to natural truth also. 'And they ate and drank' means making one's own 
the good and truth introduced in this way. 'He and the men who were with him' means the things which were in the natural man. 'And they stayed the night' means its peace. 'And they rose up in the morning' 
means a degree of raising up. 'And he said, Send me to my master' means the affection desiring the joining together. </p>

Vers. 52-54.  Et fuit, ut audivit servus Abrahami verba illorum, et incurvavit se ad terram Jehovae. Et eduxit servus vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes, et dedit Rebeccae; et pretiosa dedit fratri 
ejus, et matri ejus. Et ederunt et biberunt ille et viri qui cum illo, et pernoctarunt, et surrexerunt in mane, et dixit, {1}Mitte me domino meo. `Fuit, ut audivit servus Abrahami verba illorum, et 
incurvavit se ad terram Jehovae' significat perceptionem gaudii in naturali homine: `et eduxit servus vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes' significat verum et bonum, et ornatus eorum: `et dedit Rebeccae' 
significat quae tunc affectioni veri: `et pretiosa dedit fratri ejus' significat spiritualia bono naturali inde: `et matri ejus' significat etiam vero naturali: `et ederunt et biberunt' significat 
appropriationem boni et veri sic initiati: `ille et viri qui cum illo' significat quae in naturali homine: `et pernoctarunt significat pacem ejus: `et surrexerunt in mane' significat elevationis gradum: 
`et dixit, {1}Mitte me domino meo' significat affectionem conjunctionis. @1 Heb. mittite$  </p>
