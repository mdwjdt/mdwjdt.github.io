<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6991节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6991.</strong>“岂不是我耶和华吗”表这些不同状态的存在是由于来自神性的生命流注。这从以下事实清楚可知：“哑巴”、“聋子”、“瞎子”，以及“口”和“看见”所表示的各种状态出现在人身上是由于来自耶和华或主的生命流注。因为由该流注产生了存在于每一个人身上的邪恶和良善。然而，邪恶是由人产生的，良善是由主产生的。邪恶之所以由人产生，是因为从主所流入的生命，也就是良善和真理，被人转变为邪恶和虚假，因而转变为生命的对立面，也就是所谓的属灵死亡。这就像阳光，它照着接受它的物体而转化为具体的颜色。在有些物体上它被转化为充满生命活力的鲜活色彩，在有些物体上则被转化为死气沉沉的阴郁色彩。表面上看，好像那赋予生命的主也带来邪恶，所以在圣言中，由于表象，邪恶被归于耶和华或主，这从大量经文可以看出来。此处也一样，因为经上说“耶和华使人口哑、耳聋、眼瞎”；由于这些状态是由来自神性的生命流注产生的，故经上说耶和华把它们带来。但内义阐明并指教事情本来的样子，而非它的表象。</p>

Is it not I Jehovah? That this signifies that these things are from the influx of life from the Divine, is evident from the fact that such things as are signified by the "dumb," by the "deaf," and by 
the "blind," as also by the "mouth" and by "seeing," arise with man from the influx of life from Jehovah or the Lord. For thence arise both evils and goods with everyone; but evils from man, and goods 
from the Lord. That evils arise from man, is because the life which flows in from the Lord, that is, good and truth, is turned by man into evil and falsity, thus into what is contrary to life, which 
is called spiritual death. The case herein is like that of light from the sun, which becomes of a color in accordance with its reception by objects, some being lively and bright, and some being as it 
were dead and dusky. But as it appears as if the Lord brings in evil also, because He gives life, therefore from the appearance evil is attributed in the Word to Jehovah, or the Lord, as can be seen 
from many passages. So also in this passage it is said that "Jehovah makes what is dumb, deaf, and blind," of which, because they arise from the influx of life from the Divine, it is said that "Jehovah 
makes" them; but the internal sense sets forth and teaches the thing as it is in itself, and not as it appears.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6991</b></p><p><b>6991.</b>
'Is it not I, Jehovah?' means that these different conditions exist as a result of the influx of life from the Divine. This becomes clear from the fact that the kinds of conditions that are meant by 
'the dumb', 'the deaf', and 'the blind', as well as by 'mouth' and 'the seeing', arise with a person as a result of the influx of life from Jehovah or the Lord. For from it arise both the ill things and 
the good that exist with every single person. Yet the ill arise from man, the good from the Lord. The reason why the ill things arise from man is that the life, that is, goodness and truth, which flows 
in from the Lord is turned by man into evil and falsity, thus into the opposite of life, which is called spiritual death. It is like light from the sun, which is converted into particular colours 
by the objects receiving it. In some objects it is converted into vivid and lively colours, in others into so to speak dead and dreary ones. Now since it appears as though the Lord, being the One who 
gives life, is also responsible for what is ill, that which is ill is attributed in the Word - owing to that appearance - to Jehovah or the Lord, as may be recognized from a large number of places. The 
same applies here to His making the dumb, the deaf, and the blind; because these conditions arise from the influx of life from the Divine it is said that Jehovah brings them about. But the internal 
sense presents and teaches the true nature of the matter, not the apparent nature of it. </p>

</p><b>6991.</b>
`Nonne Ego Jehovah?':  quod significet quod illa ex influxu vitae a Divino, constare potest ex eo quod talia quae significantur per `mutum,' per `surdum,' perque `caecum,' tum quoque per `os' et per 
`videntem,' existant apud hominem ex influxu vitae a Jehovah seu Domino; inde enim existunt tam mala quam bona apud unumquemvis; sed mala ab homine, et bona a Domino; quod mala ab homine existant, est 
quia vita quae a Domino influit, hoc est, {1}bonum et verum, ab homine vertatur in {2}malum et falsum, ita in contrarium vitae, {3}quod mors spiritualis vocatur; se habet hoc sicut lux a sole quae {4}prout 
recipitur ab objectis, talis inde color fit, in quibusdam vivus et lucidus, in quibusdam quasi mortuus et fuscus.  {5}At quia apparet sicut Dominus etiam inducat malum, (d)quia dat vitam, idcirco 
ex apparentia in Verbo tribuitur Jehovae seu Domino malum, ut ex pluribus locis constare potest; ita quoque hic quod faciat mutum, surdum, et caecum, quae quia existunt ex influxu vitae a Divino, 
ideo dicitur quod Jehovah illa faciat; at sensus internus rem qualis in se est, exponit et docet, non qualis apparet. 	@1 verum et bonum$ 	@2 falsum et malum$ 	@3 quae I$ 	@4 sicut$ 	@5 Et$ </p>
