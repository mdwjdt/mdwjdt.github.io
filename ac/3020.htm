<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3020节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3020.</strong>“那管理他所有一切的”表属世人的职能或职责。这从“管理”，尤其“管理一切”的含义清楚可知，“管理”或“管理一切”是指履行职能或职责。 属世人对于理性人，或也可说，外在人对于内在人来说，就像一个管家（<a href="1795.htm">1795</a>节）。人里面的一切事物就像一个家庭，即一个家族，得有一个人履行家主的职责，其他人则履行仆人的职责。理性心智本身就是作为家主安排一切，并凭进入属世心智的流注而将它们整理得井然有序的那一位。而属世心智则是那服侍并管理者。<br />属世心智不同于理性心智，它存在于理性心智之下的那个层面，从某种意义上说行事独立，故相对于理性心智而言，它被称为“仆人，家中的老者”，是“那管理他所有一切的”。属世心智不同于理性心智，它存在于理性心智之下的那个层面，从某种意义上说行事独立。这一事实从它里面所拥有的事物，以及它所履行的职能可以看出来。它里面所拥有的事物就是一切记忆知识，因而是各种认知，总之，就是属于外部或肉体记忆的每一个事物（对此，参看<a href="2471.htm">2471</a>，<a href="2480.htm">2480</a>节）。构成人的内在感官意识，在孩子身上，在青春期早期阶段最为活跃的全部想象力就属于外部记忆。人与野兽所共有的一切属世情感也属于外部记忆。由此明显可知属世心智的职责是什么。<br />但理性心智更为内在。它里面所拥有的知识，也就是说，属于内部记忆的每一个事物对人来说并不明显，在他活在肉身时是察觉不到的（对此，参看<a href="2470.htm">2470</a>-<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>，<a href="2489.htm">2489</a>，<a href="2490.htm">2490</a>节）。一切思维能力，也就是对公平与公义，以及真理与良善的觉察也属于理性心智。另外，一切属灵的情感，也就是使人区别于野兽的严格意义上的人性，同样属于理性心智。该心智通过它里面的这些事物流入属世心智，激活那里的事物，以一种眼光看待它们，并以这种方式进行判断、得出结论。这两种心智截然不同，这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来：对很多人来说，属世人统治理性人，或也可说，外在人统治内在人。然而，它只在那些具有仁之善，也就是允许自己被主引领之人身上没有统治权，而是进行服侍。</p>

Who administered all that he had. That this signifies the offices of the natural man is evident from the signification of "administering," and indeed of "administering all things," as being to discharge 
offices or duties. (That the natural man in respect to the rational, or what is the same, the external man in respect to the internal, is like the administrator in a house, may be seen above, n. 1795.) 
All things that are in man are as one household (that is, as one family) in this respect, that there is one who fills the office of master of the house, and others who fill that of servants. The 
rational mind itself is that which disposes all things as master of the house, and arranges them in order by influx into the natural mind; but it is the natural mind that ministers and is the administrator. [2] 
As the natural mind is distinct from the rational mind and is in a degree below it, and as it also acts as if from what is its own, it is called relatively a "servant the elder of the house," 
and it is said to administer all the things in itself that belong to it. That the natural mind is distinct from the rational, and is in a lower degree, and is as if in what is its own, may be seen 
from the things within it, and from its offices. The things which are therein are all memory-knowledges, thus also all knowledges of every kind whatever; in a word, they are all things in both general 
and particular that belong to the outer or corporeal memory (concerning which see n. 2471, 2480). To this mind also belongs all the imaginative faculty, which is the interior sensuous with man, and 
which is in the greatest vigor with children; and in the first age of adolescence; to the same mind belong also all natural affections that man has in common with brute animals; all of which shows what 
its offices are. [3] But the rational mind is more internal. The knowledges in it are not open before man, but while he lives in the body are imperceptible; for they are all things in both general 
and particular that belong to the interior memory (concerning which see n. 2470-2474, 2489, 2490). To this mind also belongs all the thinking faculty that is perceptive of what is equitable and just, 
and of what is true and good; also all spiritual affections, which are properly human, and by which man is distinguished from the brute animals. From these things this mind flows into the natural mind, 
and excites the things that are therein, and views them with a kind of sight, and in this manner judges and forms conclusions. That these two minds are distinct is clearly evident from the fact that 
with many persons the natural mind bears rule over the rational mind; or what is the same, the external man over the internal man; and that it does not bear rule but serves with those only who are in 
the good of charity, that is, who suffer themselves to be led by the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3020</b></p><p><b>3020.</b>
'Who administered all that he had' means the functions of the natural man. This is clear from the meaning of 'administering', and in particular of 'administering all things', as performing functions 
or duties. The relationship of the natural man to the rational, or what amounts to the same, of the external man to the internal, is like that of one who administers in a house, see <a href="1795.htm">1795</a>. All things in 
man are like one house, that is, one family, for there is one who has the duty to be head of the family, and others who have the duty of servants. The rational mind itself is the one that organizes 
everything, like the head of the family, and by influx brings order into the natural mind. The natural mind however is one that serves and administers. And because the natural mind is distinct and separate 
from the rational mind, existing on a level below the latter, and also in a sense acts independently, it is called in relationship to the rational 'the servant, the oldest of the house' and 'the 
one who administered all that he had there'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the natural mind is distinct and separate from the rational, existing on a level below it, and in a sense acting independently, becomes 
clear from the things it has within it, and from the functions it performs. The things it has within it are all facts, and so also all cognitions of every kind - in short, every single thing belonging 
to the exterior or physical memory, dealt with in <a href="2471.htm">2471</a>, <a href="2480.htm">2480</a>. To this memory also belongs the whole faculty of imagination, which constitutes man's interior sensory awareness and is particularly active 
with children and during the early stages of adolescence. To the exterior memory belong in addition all the natural affections which man has in common with animals. From this it is evident what 
the functions of the natural mind are. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The rational mind however is interior. The items of knowledge it has within it, that is to say, every single thing belonging to the interior memory, are not 
evident to man, but are imperceptible during his lifetime, dealt with in <a href="2470.htm">2470</a>- <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>, <a href="2489.htm">2489</a>, <a href="2490.htm">2490</a>. It also has within it the power of thought, which is a perceptivity of what is fair and righteous, as 
well as of what is true and good. In addition it has all the spiritual affections which are strictly human and which mark man off from animals. From these things within itself the rational mind flows 
into the natural mind and activates the things that are there, views them with a certain vision, and in this way forms judgements and conclusions. The fact that these two minds are distinct and separate 
is quite evident from this consideration: With many people the natural mind has dominion over the rational mind, or what amounts to the same, the external man has dominion over the internal; yet 
it does not have dominion and is subservient only with those in whom the good of charity is present, that is, who allow themselves to be led by the Lord. </p>

`Administrantem omnia quae ei': quod significet naturalis hominis officia, constat ex significatione `administrare,' et quidem `administrare omnia,' quod sit obire officia seu munia: quod naturalis 
homo respective ad rationalem, seu quod idem, externus homo respective ad internum, se habeat similiter ac administrator in domo, videatur n. 1795; omnia quae in homine sunt, se habent sicut una domus, 
hoc est, sicut una familia, quod sit qui patrisfamilias munus obit, et sint qui servorum; ipsa mens rationalis est qui disponit omnia sicut paterfamilias, et per influxum in mentem naturalem ordinat; 
mens autem naturalis est {1}quae ministrat et administrat; quia mens naturalis est distincta a mente rationali, et in gradu infra {2}hanc, et ex quodam proprio etiam agit, vocatur illa respective `servus 
senior domus,' et `administrans omnia quae ei ibi'; [2] quod mens naturalis sit distincta mens a rationali, et in gradu inferiore, ac in quodam proprio, constare potest ex illis quae ibi, et ejus 
officiis; illa quae ibi sunt omnia scientifica, ita quoque omnes cognitiones cujuscumque generis{3}, verbo omnia et singula quae sunt memoriae exterioris seu corporeae, de qua n. 2471, 2480.  Illius 
etiam est omne imaginativum, quod est interius sensuale apud hominem, ac viget imprimis apud pueros et in aetate prima adolescentiae; illius etiam sunt omnes affectiones naturales quas homo cum brutis 
animalibus communes habet; [3] inde patet quae ejus officia sunt: mens autem rationalis est interior; {4}cognitiva quae ibi, non patent coram homine, sed sunt, cum in corpore vivit, imperceptibilia, 
nempe omnia et singula quae sunt memoriae interioris, de qua n. 2470-2474, 2489, 2490; omne etiam cogitativum quod perceptivum aequi et justi, tum veri et boni, est ejus; etiam omnes affectiones spirituales 
quae proprie humanae sunt et per quas homo a brutis animalibus {5}distinguitur; mens haec ab illis influit in mentem naturalem, et ea quae ibi excitat, et visu quodam intuetur, et sic judicat 
et concludit.  Quod hae binae mentes distinctae sint, patet manifeste ex eo quod apud plures mens naturalis dominetur super mentem rationalem, seu quod idem, externus homo super internum; et quod solum 
apud illos non dominetur, sed servit, qui in bono charitatis sunt, hoc est, qui a Domino se duci patiuntur. @1 qui$  @2 illam$  @3 i sunt$  @4 A had cognitiones but d and i cognitiva$  @5 after homo$  </p>
