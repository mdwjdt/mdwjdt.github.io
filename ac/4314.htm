<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4314节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4314.</strong>就内在历史意义而言，“他的大腿就瘸了”表在这些后代当中，良善与真理完全被摧毁。这从雅各的代表和“大腿瘸了”的含义清楚可知：雅各，也就是此处的“他”，是指他的后代（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>节）；“大腿瘸了”表示那些没有任何良善，因而没有任何真理的人（<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>节）。故此处“他的大腿就瘸了”表示在这些后代当中，良善与真理完全被摧毁。<br />该民族的性质从主自己以比喻所说的许多话变得显而易见，就其内在历史意义而言，这些话都是指着这个民族说的，如：一个王与他的仆人算账，而这个仆人却不怜恤别人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.23.htm">18:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.35.htm">35</a>）；还有家主的比喻，家主将他的葡萄园租给园户，就往国外去了，租户拿住他打发来的仆人，用棍打了一个，杀了一个，用石头打死一个；最后他打发自己的儿子去，他们把他推出葡萄园外，杀了；文士和法利赛人一听到这个比喻，就知道祂是指他们自己说的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.33.htm">21:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.45.htm">45</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.9.htm">9</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.9.htm">20:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.19.htm">19</a>）；还有一个比喻，有一个人给仆人银子，那个领一千的人去把它埋藏在地里（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.14.htm">25:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.30.htm">30</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.13.htm">19:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.16.htm">16</a>）；那些从被强盗打伤的人身边过去之人的比喻（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.30.htm">10:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.37.htm">37</a>）；大筵席的比喻，即那些被请赴大筵席的人都给自己找了各种借口，主人论到他们说，我告诉你们，先前所请的人没有一个得尝我的筵席（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.16.htm">14:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.24.htm">24</a>）；财主和拉撒路的比喻（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.19.htm">16:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.31.htm">31</a>）；那些与自己相比，看不起别人之人的比喻（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.10.htm">18:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.14.htm">14</a>）；两个儿子的比喻，其中一个儿子说，我要去葡萄园，却不去；耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.28.htm">21:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.32.htm">32</a>）。<br />主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.13.htm">23:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.39.htm">39</a>）中公开声明这个民族的品性，在这段经文的末尾，祂说：<br />你们自己证明是杀害先知者的子孙了，你们去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.13.htm">23:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.33.htm">33</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />耶稣对他们说，以赛亚书指着你们所说的预言是不错的，这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我；所以拜我也是枉然，你们将人的规矩当作教义来教导，却离弃神的诫命。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.6.htm">7:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.13.htm">13</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />犹太回答耶稣说，我们是亚伯拉罕的种；耶稣却对他们说，你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们偏要行。他从起初是杀人的，不守真理，因他心里没有真理；他说谎时，是出于自己说的，因他本来是说谎的，也是谎言之父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.33.htm">8:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.44.htm">44</a>）<br />由于他们的性质就是这样，所以他们也被称为“邪恶淫乱的世代”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.39.htm">12:39</a>），“毒蛇的后代”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.7.htm">3:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.33.htm">23:33</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.7.htm">3:7</a>），“毒蛇的后代啊，你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.34.htm">12:34</a>）。<br />在这个民族当中，甚至连一丝属世良善都荡然无存，这一事实就是马太福音中无花果树所表示的：<br />耶稣看见路旁有一棵无花果树，就走到跟前，在树上找不着什么，不过有叶子，就对树说，从今以后，你永不结果子！那无花果树就立刻枯干了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.19.htm">21:19</a>）<br />无花果树表示属世良善（参看<a href="217.htm">217</a>节）。从这些经文可以看出，在这个民族当中，良善与真理已经完全被摧毁了。<br />当良善与真理从内在一无所存时，可以说它们已经被摧毁了。外在可见的良善与真理从内在的良善与真理获得自己的存在和生活，故内在良善与真理的性质决定了外在良善与真理的性质，无论后一种如何呈现在人眼前。有些人活在肉身时我就认识，那时他们看上去似乎对主、教会，对他们的国家和公众福祉，对正义公平很有热情；然而，在来世，这些人却在地狱居民之列。事实上，我震惊地发现，他们就在那里最坏者当中。原因在于，他们的内层是污秽和亵渎的，他们伪装出这种热情是为了名声，以便获得荣耀和财富，因而是为他们自己的缘故，而不是为了他们口头上所宣称的。因此，当这些外在脱去后，如人们死亡时的情形，内在就会暴露出来，人们就会看到这些人内在的样子；因为他们在世时向世人隐藏了自己的内在。这就是“良善与真理完全被摧毁”的意思。</p>

That in the internal historical sense by "he halted upon his thigh" is signified that goods and truths were altogether destroyed with that posterity, is evident from the representation of Jacob, who 
here is "he," as being his posterity (see n. 4281); and from the signification of "halting upon the thigh" as denoting those who are in no good, and consequently in no truth (n. 4302). Here therefore 
by his "halting upon his thigh" is signified that goods and truths were altogether destroyed with that posterity.  [2] The quality of that nation is also plainly evident from many things spoken by the 
Lord Himself in parables, which in their internal historical sense were said of that nation-as in the parable of the man that was a king, who took account with his servant in whom there was no mercy 
toward another (Matt. 18:23-35); in the parable of the householder who let out his vineyard to husbandmen, and went abroad, and the husbandmen seized the servants whom he sent, and beat one with rods, 
and killed another, and stoned another; and at last he sent his son, whom they cast out of the vineyard and killed; on hearing which parable the Scribes and Pharisees recognized it as spoken of themselves 
(Matt. 21:33-45; Mark 12:1-9; Luke 20:9-19); in the parable of the man who gave talents to his servants, and he who received the one talent went and hid it in the earth (Matt. 25:14-30; Luke 19:13-16); 
in the parable of those who came to him that was wounded by the robbers (Luke 10:30-37); in the parable of those who were invited to the great supper, and all excused themselves, of whom the 
Lord says, I say to you that none of those men who were bidden shall taste of my supper (Luke 14:16-24); in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31); in the parable of those who despise 
others in comparison with themselves (Luke 18:10-14); in the parable of the two sons, one of whom said, I will go into the vineyard, but went not; and Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, that the publicans 
and harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you" (Matt. 21:28-32). [3] The quality of that nation the Lord openly declared in Matthew 23:13-39, where He says: "Ye witness against yourselves, 
that ye are the sons of them that killed the prophets, and ye fill up the measure of your fathers" (Matt. 23:13-33). In Mark, "Jesus said unto them, Rightly did Esaias prophesy of you, This people 
honoreth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me; in vain do they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men, forsaking the commandments of God" (Mark 7:6-13). In John: The Jews 
answered Jesus that they were the seed of Abraham; but Jesus said to them, "Ye are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father ye will to do; he was a murderer from the beginning, and stood 
not in the truth, because the truth is not in him; when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; because he is the speaker of a lie, and the father of it" (John 8:33, 44). Because they were such, 
they are also called an "evil and adulterous generation" (Matt. 12:39), and the "offspring of vipers" (Matt. 3:7; 23:33; Luke 3:7); "O offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?" 
(Matt. 12:34). [4] That not even any natural good was left with that nation, is signified by the fig-tree spoken of in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus seeing a fig-tree in the way, came to it, but found nothing 
thereon but leaves only; therefore He said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever, and presently the fig-tree withered away (Matt. 21:19); </p>
<p>that the fig-tree denotes natural good may 
be seen above (n. 217).  [5] From these passages it may be seen that goods and truths were altogether destroyed with that nation. Goods and truths are said to be destroyed when there are none interiorly. 
The goods and truths which appear outwardly derive their being and their living from those which are internal; and therefore such as are the internal ones, such are the external, howsoever the 
latter may appear to the eyes of man. There are some whom I knew in their bodily life, and who then appeared as having zeal for the Lord, for the church, for their country and the common good, and for 
justice and equity; and yet in the other life these same are among the infernals, and (what astonished me) among the worst there. The reason was, that their interiors had been foul and profane, and that 
they had counterfeited that zeal for the sake of reputation, in order to acquire honors and also to gain wealth; thus for their own sakes, and not for the sake of what they professed with the mouth. 
When therefore these externals are put off, which takes place when men die, the internals are laid open and appear as they had been within, and which during life they had hidden from the world. This 
is what is meant by the goods and truths being altogether destroyed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4314</b></p><p><b>4314.</b>
In the internal historical sense 'he was limping on his thigh' means that with those descendants goods and truths had been destroyed completely. This is clear from the representation of Jacob, to whom 
'he' refers here, as his descendants, dealt with in <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, and from the meaning of 'limping on the thigh' as those who are without any good or consequently any truth, dealt with in <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>. Here therefore 
'he was limping on his thigh' means that with those descendants goods and truths had been destroyed completely. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The nature of that nation is made very plain by many things which the Lord Himself 
spoke in parables and which in the internal historical sense were said of that nation, as in the following, </p>
<blockquote>
In the parable about a certain king who was settling the account with the servant who 
showed no mercy towards another. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:23-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:23-end</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the parable about the householder who let his vineyard out to vine-dressers and went abroad; and the vine-dressers seized the servants he sent, 
beating one with rods, killing another, and stoning another. At length he sent his son whom they cast out of the vineyard and killed. When the scribes and Pharisees heard this parable they realized 
that He was speaking about themselves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:33-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21:33-45</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:1-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:1-9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2020:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 20:9</a> 
</blockquote>
and following verses. </p>
<blockquote>
In the parable about the man who gave talents to his servants and how the servant who received one 
talent went and hid it in the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:14-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:14-30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:12-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:12-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
In the parable about those who came upon the man who had been wounded by the robbers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:30-37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:30-37</a>. In the parable about those 
who were invited to the great supper and all of whom made excuses, and of whom the master said, I tell you, none of those men who were invited will taste my supper. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2014:16-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 14:16-24</a>. In the parable about 
the rich man and Lazarus. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:19-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:19-end</a>. In the parable about those who despised others compared with themselves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:10-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:10-14</a> In the parable about the two sons, one of whom said, I will go off 
into the vineyard, but did not go, and in which Jesus said, Truly I say to you, Tax collectors and prostitutes will go into the kingdom of heaven before you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:28-32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21:28-32</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Lord states 
plainly what that nation was like in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2023:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 23:13</a> onwards, towards the end of which passage He says, </p>
<blockquote>
You witness against yourselves that you are the sons of those who slew the prophets; and you are 
filling up the measure of your fathers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2023:31-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 23:31-33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to them, Rightly did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, This people honours Me with their lips, but their heart is very 
far away from Me. In vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men, forsaking the commandment of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%207:6-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 7:6-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The Jews answered Jesus that they were the seed 
of Abraham. But Jesus said to them, You are from your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not take a stand on the truth because 
the truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie he speaks from the things that are his own, for he is the teller of a lie and the father of it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:33,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:33, 44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Because their nature was such they are 
also called 'a wicked and adulterous generation', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:39</a>, as well as 'a brood of vipers', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%203:7;%2023:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 3:7; 23:33</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%203:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 3:7</a>; and in Matthew, </p>
<p>O brood of vipers, how can you speak good things when you 
are evil? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:34</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that with that nation not even any natural good was left is meant by the fig tree referred to in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus seeing a fig tree by the wayside went to it 
but found nothing on it but leaves only, therefore He said to it, Let no fruit from now on ever be born from you! Therefore the fig tree withered at once. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A fig tree' means natural good, 
see <a href="217.htm">217</a>. From all these places it may be seen that with that nation goods and truths had been destroyed completely. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Goods and truths are said to have been destroyed when none exist interiorly. 
Goods and truths which are visible externally derive their being and their life from those that are internal. The nature of internal goods and truths therefore determines that of external ones, however 
these present themselves to human eyes. There are some people whom I knew during their lifetime and who during that period were to outward appearance zealous for the Lord, for the Church, for their 
country and the common good, and for what was right and fair; and yet in the next life these same people are among those in hell. Indeed I have been astonished to find them among the most evil ones 
there. The reason why they were there was that interiorly they had been filthy and profane, and that they had pretended to be zealous for the sake of reputation, so as to gain important positions and 
also to acquire wealth. Thus they had been zealous for selfish reasons and not for the things which they professed with their lips. Consequently when those external things are laid aside, as happens 
when people die, internals are laid bare and one sees what those people have been like inwardly; for during their lifetime they had concealed their internals from the eyes of the world. These are the 
considerations that are meant by the statement that goods and truths have been destroyed completely. </p>

Quod in sensu interno historico per `is claudicans super femore suo' significetur quod bona et vera prorsus deperdita essent apud posteritatem illam, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi,' qui hic

bona loqui, cum      mali sitis, xii 34. [4] Quod apud illam gentem ne quidem bonum naturale ullum residuum esset {2}, significatur per `ficum' de qua apud Matthaeum,           Jesus videns ficum 
unam in via, venit ad eam, sed nihil      invenit in ea nisi folia tantum, ideo dixit illi, Ne posthac      ex te fructus nascatur in aeternum, unde arefacta est ex      tempore ficus, xxi 19; </p>
<p>quod 
`ficus' sit bonum naturale, videatur n. 217.  Ex his constare potest quod bona et vera prorsus deperdita essent apud gentem illam.  [5] Bona et vera deperdita dicuntur, cum interius nulla sunt; 
bona et vera quae extrinsecus apparent, trahunt suum esse et suum vivere ab internis; qualia itaque interna sunt, talia sunt externa, utcumque haec coram oculis hominis apparent. Sunt aliqui {3} quos 
cognovi in vita corporis eorum, et qui tunc apparuerunt sicut in zelo pro Domino, pro Ecclesia, pro patria et communi bono, et pro justo et aequo, et tamen iidem in altera vita inter infernales 
sunt, et quod miratus, inter pessimos ibi; causa fuit quod interiora eorum foeda et profana fuissent, et quod mentiti zelum illum propter famam ad aucupandum honores et quoque ad lucrandum' opes, ita 
propter se, non autem propter illa quae ore professi sunt; quapropter cum externa illa exuuntur, quod fit cum moriuntur, patent interna, et apparent sicut fuerant intus, quae dum vixerant, coram 
mundo absconderunt; haec sunt quae intelliguntur per quod bona et vera prorsus deperdita sint.      @1 inciderunt in$      @2 essent I$      @3 plures$ </p>
