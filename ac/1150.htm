<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1150.</strong>前面说过，“雅弗的儿子”表那些具有与内在相应的外在敬拜之人。当有本质元素存在于敬拜中时，就说外在敬拜与内在相对应。这本质元素就是发自内心爱慕主，若没有仁爱，或对邻之爱，这样的爱慕是决无可能的。主就存在于仁爱或对邻之爱中，这时祂才有可能被发自内心爱慕。因此，爱慕来自主，因为主使一切爱慕成为可能，并赋予它一切存在。由此可知，人的仁爱如何，他的爱慕或敬拜就如何。一切敬拜都是爱慕，为了敬拜成为敬拜，爱慕必须在于敬拜中。雅弗的儿子，即称作雅弗儿子的民族和人民就生活在彼此宽容、友善、礼貌和质朴中，因此主存在于他们的敬拜中。当主存在于外在敬拜中时，外在中就会有内在敬拜，即就有与内在相应的外在敬拜。过去，这样的民族非常多，而且如今，将敬拜专注于外在事物、不知何为内在敬拜的民族仍就存在。即便知道，他们也不会思想这类事物。若这些人承认主，热爱邻人，主就在他们的敬拜中，他们就是“雅弗的儿子”。但是，若他们否认主，只爱自己，根本不关心邻人，更糟糕的是，还憎恨邻人，那么其敬拜就是脱离内在的外在，而他们就成了“迦南的儿子”或迦南人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1150.</strong> The symbolism of the sons of Japheth as those who engaged in outward worship corresponding to inward has been mentioned already [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1150/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062" target=_top>1062</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1150/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1150/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1096" target=_top>1096</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1150/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1098" target=_top>1098</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1150/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1099" target=_top>1099-1102</a>].<br />Outward worship is described as corresponding to inward when it contains the essential ingredient, which is heartfelt reverence for the Lord. Such reverence is not possible in the least except where charity, or love for one's neighbor, exists. Charity, or love for our neighbor, contains the Lord's presence. With it, we can adore the Lord from the heart. When we have charity, our reverence comes from the Lord, since the Lord gives us all the ability to revere him and all the vital essence of our veneration. It follows, then, that the kind of charity we have determines the quality of our adoration, that is, the quality of our worship. All worship is veneration, because it has to have reverence for the Lord within it in order to be worshipful.<br />[2] Japheth's sons, or the nations and peoples called Japheth's sons, lived together in mutual kindness, friendship, politeness, and simple innocence, so the Lord was also present in their worship. When the Lord infuses outward worship, internal worship is present in external; in other words, external worship then answers to internal.<br />Most non-Christian nations were once like this, and even today there exist some that view worship as a matter of external acts, unaware of any internal facet or, if they are aware, without any thought about it. If they acknowledge the Lord and love their fellow humans, the Lord is within their worship and they are Japheth's children. If they deny the Lord, however, and love only themselves, if they do not care about others or, worse, hate them, their worship is shallow and detached from inner worship. Then they are Canaan's children, or Canaanites. </p>

The sons of Japheth. That these signify those who had external worship corresponding to internal, has been explained before. External worship is said to correspond to internal when that which is the 
essential is in the worship. This essential is the adoration of the Lord from the heart; which is by no means possible unless there is charity, or love to the neighbor. In charity or love toward the neighbor 
the Lord is present, and then He can be adored from the heart. Thus the adoration is from the Lord, for the Lord gives all the ability and all the being in the adoration. Hence it follows that 
such as is the charity in a man, such is his adoration or worship. All worship is adoration, because the adoration of the Lord must be in it for it to be worship. The sons of Japheth, or the nations 
and peoples called "sons of Japheth," lived in mutual charity with each other, in friendship, in courtesy, and in simplicity; and therefore the Lord was present in their worship. For when the Lord is 
present in the external worship, there is internal worship in the external, that is, there is external worship corresponding to internal. There were formerly very many such nations. And there are also 
at this day those who make worship consist in externals and do not know what internal worship is, or if they know, do not think about such things. If these persons acknowledge the Lord and love the neighbor, 
the Lord is in their worship, and they are sons of Japheth; but if they deny the Lord, and love only themselves, and do not care for the neighbor, especially if they bear hatred toward him, their 
worship is external separate from internal, and they are sons of Canaan, or Canaanites. </p>

That 'the sons of Japheth' means those who possessed external worship corresponding to internal has been stated already. It is called external worship corresponding to internal when the worship has what 
is essential within it. And that which is essential is adoration of the Lord from the heart, which in no sense exists unless charity, or love towards the neighbour, is present. It is in charity or 
love towards the neighbour that the Lord is present, in which case it is possible for Him to be adored from the heart. Thus it is from the Lord that adoration comes, for the Lord makes all adoration 
possible and gives it all its being. It follows therefore that as is a person's charity, so is his adoration or worship. All worship is adoration, for adoration of the Lord must be in it for it to be 
worship. The sons of Japheth, that is, the nations and peoples called the sons of Japheth, lived with one another in mutual charity, in friendship, in civility, and in simplicity, and consequently the 
Lord was present in their worship. For when the Lord is present in external worship internal worship is in that case within the external, that is, there is external worship corresponding to internal. 
In former times very many nations were such, and nations also exist at the present day who focus worship on external things without knowing what the internal is. And if they do know they give no thought 
to those matters. If those people acknowledge the Lord and love the neighbour, the Lord is in their worship and they are 'sons of Japheth'. But if they deny the Lord, love only themselves and do not 
care about the neighbour, worse still if they hate him, then their worship is external separated from internal, and they are 'sons of Canaan' or Canaanites. </p>

</p><b>1150.</b>
'Filii Japheti':  quod significent illos qui cultum externum correspondentem interno habuerunt, prius dictum est:  cultus externus correspondens interno dicitur quando essentiale inest cultui; essentiale 
est adoratio Domini ex corde, quae nusquam dabilis est nisi charitas sit, seu amor erga proximum; in charitate seu amore erga proximum Dominus est praesens, tunc adorari potest ex corde; sic ex 
Dominus adoratio, nam Dominus dat omne posse et omne esse in adoratione; inde sequitur, qualis charitas apud hominem talis adoratio seu cultus; omnis cultus est adoratio quia ei inesse debet adoratio 
Domini ut sit cultus.  Filii Japheti seu gentes et populi qui filii Japheti dicti sunt vixerunt inter se in charitate mutua, in amicitia, in civilitate, inque simplicitate,	quare etiam in illorum cultu 
aderat Dominus; nam cum adest Dominus in cultu externo, tunc cultus internus est in externo, seu est cultus externus correspondens interno.  Perplurimae gentes olim tales fuerunt, hodie quoque dantur, 
qui in externis ponunt cultum, nec sciunt quid internum, sique sciunt, non de illis cogitant; illi si agnoscunt Dominum et amant proximum, Dominus est in illorum cultu et sunt 'filii Japheti'; at si 
negant Dominum, et se modo amant, ac proximum non curant, magis si odio habent, eorum cultus est externus separatus ab interno et sunt 'filii Canaanis' seu 'Canaanitae.' </p>
