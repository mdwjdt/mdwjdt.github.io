<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10568节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10568</strong>.“摩西对祂说，你的脸若不走在我前面，就不要把我们从这里领上去”表如果神性不存在于那里，那里将不会有构成教会的任何东西。这从“耶和华的脸”和“把我们从这里领上去”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的脸”是指教会、敬拜和圣言的内层神性事物，如刚才所述（参看<a href="10567.htm">10567</a>节）；“把我们从这里领上去”是指那里将不会有构成教会的任何东西。这些话之所以具有这种含义，是因为“被领进迦南地”表示教会的建立；因此，“不要把我们从这里领上去”表示没有这些内层事物，那里将不会有构成教会的任何东西。“被领进迦南地”表示教会的建立（<a href="10560.htm">10560</a>，<a href="10561.htm">10561</a>节）。被领进迦南地之所以表示教会的建立，是因为圣言中的“迦南地”在天上只被理解为教会。天上的人在一个属灵层面理解圣言中的一切事物；因此，当无论经上提到什么地方，他们想到的都是诸如构成存在于那地或住在其中的民族当中的教会的那类事物。天上的天使不会把思想集中在任何地的概念上，因为这种概念是物质的；他们也不会集中在任何民族的概念上，因为这种概念也是物质的；因此，一种属灵的概念立刻呈现给他们，这种概念与教会有关。一般来说，属灵概念与主、主的国、天堂、教会、对主的爱和信，以及属于信和爱，因而属于教会的无数事物有关。若你愿意相信，任何物质的概念都不可能进入天堂；就在天堂的第一道门槛处，它就会被脱去。这就是圣言中的每一个事物的情况。正因如此，被领进迦南地表示教会的建立，此处没有被领进去表示教会没有建立。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10568</b></p><p><b>10568.</b>
And he said unto Him, If Thy faces go not, do not make us go up from hence. That this signifies that if the Divine be not there, there will not be anything of the church, is evident from the signification 
of the "faces of Jehovah," as being the interior Divine things of the church, of worship, and of the Word (of which just above, see n. 10567); and from the signification of "not making us go up 
hence," as being that there will not be anything of the church. The reason why this is signified by these words, is that by being "brought into the land of Canaan" is signified the setting up of the church; 
thus by "not making us go up from hence" is signified that thus there will not be anything of the church. That by being "brought into the land of Canaan" is signified the setting up of the church, 
may be seen above (n. 10560, 10561); and this is signified for the reason that by "the land of Canaan" in the Word nothing else is understood in heaven but the church, for in heaven all things of 
the Word are spiritually perceived. Wherefore when mention is made of any land, they think there of such things as are of the church in that land, or with the nation there. The angels of heaven cannot 
keep the mind in the idea of any land, because the idea of land is material; nor in the idea of any nation, for this idea also is material. Wherefore a spiritual idea at once occurs to them, which idea 
is about the church. In general a spiritual idea is about the Lord, His kingdom, heaven, the church, love to and faith in the Lord, and about countless things that belong to faith and love, thus that 
belong to the church. And if you will believe it, it is impossible for any material idea to enter heaven; it is put off at the first threshold. Such is the case with the whole and every part of the 
Word. From this then it is that by being "brought into the land of Canaan" is signified the setting up of the church; and by "not being brought" as here is signified no setting up of it. </p>

'And he said to Him, If Your face is not going [before me], do not cause us to go up from here' means that if the Divine is not present there, nothing constituting the Church will be there. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'Jehovah's face' as things that are interior and Divine in the Church, worship, and the Word, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10567.htm">10567</a>; and from the meaning of 'do not cause us to 
go up from here' as that nothing constituting the Church will be there. The reason why these words have this meaning is that being led into the land of Canaan means the establishment of the Church, 
and therefore 'do not cause us to go up from here' means that without those interior things nothing constituting the Church will be present. For the meaning of being led into the land of Canaan as the 
establishment of the Church, see above in <a href="10560.htm">10560</a>, <a href="10561.htm">10561</a>. The reason why being led into the land of Canaan means the establishment of the Church is that by the land of Canaan in the Word those in heaven 
understand nothing at all other than the Church. They perceive everything in the Word on a spiritual level; consequently when any land is mentioned they think of the kinds of things constituting the 
Church that exist in that land or among the nation inhabiting it. Angels in heaven cannot keep their mind focused on the idea of a land because that idea is a material one, nor on the idea of any nation 
since this idea too is material; therefore a spiritual idea is what immediately presents itself to them, an idea that has something to do with the Church. In general a spiritual idea has to do with 
the Lord, His kingdom, heaven, the Church, love to the Lord and faith in Him, and countless aspects of faith and love, thus of the Church. And if you are willing to believe it, it is impossible for 
any material idea to enter heaven; it is cast off at the gateway of heaven. This is how it is with every single thing in the Word. So it is then that being led into the land of Canaan means the establishment 
of the Church, and not being led in, implied in the present verse, its not being established.  </p>

</p><b>10568.</b>
`Et dixit ad Ipsum, Si non facies Tuae euntes, ne ascendere facias nos abhinc':  quod significet si non Divinum sit ibi, non aliquid Ecclesiae erit, constat ex significatione `facierum Jehovae' quod 
sint Divina interiora Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, de qua mox supra n. 10567, et ex significatione `ne ascendere facias nos abhinc' quod sit quod non aliquid Ecclesiae erit; quod hoc per illa verba significetur, 
est quia per introduci in terram Canaanem significatur instauratio Ecclesiae, inde per `ne ascendere facias non abhinc' significatur quod sic non aliquid Ecclesiae erit; quod per introduci 
in terram Canaanem significetur instauratio Ecclesiae, videatur supra n. 10560, 10561; {1}quod per introduci in terram Canaanem significetur instauratio (x)Ecclesiae, est quia per terram Canaanem in 
Verbo non aliud in caelo intelligitur quam Ecclesia, in caelo enim omnia Verbi spiritualiter percipiuntur, quare cum memoratur aliqua terra, tunc cogitatur ibi de talibus quae Ecclesiae sunt in illa 
terra, seu apud gentem quae ibi; angeli caeli non possunt mentem tenere in idea terrae, quoniam idea terrae est materialis, nec in idea gentis alicujus, nam haec idea etiam materialis est, {2}quapropter 
illis obvenit statim idea spiritualis, quae est de Ecclesia; idea spiritualis in genere est de Domino, de regno Ipsius, de caelo, de Ecclesia, de amore et fide in Dominum, et de innumerabilibus quae 
fidei et amoris sunt, ita quae Ecclesiae; et si credere {3}velitis, impossibile est ut aliqua idea materialis intret caelum, exuitur illa ad primum limen {4}; ita fit cum omnibus et singulis Verbi. 
 {5}Inde nunc est quod per introduci in terram Canaanem significetur instauratio Ecclesiae, et per non introduci, ut hic, nulla instauratio. @1 ne miremini quod dicatur quod per illa verba significetur 
Ecclesia, sed quod significetur est causa,$ @2 quapropter intrant statim in ideam spiritualem, quae est propria coeli et angelica, haec idea$ @3 dignemini$ @4 i coeli, ac intret absque materiali, 
sub habitu coelesti$ @5 haec nunc causa$ </p>
