<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6194.</strong>我有时会独自思考，或与其他人交谈，却没有意识到促使这些活动发生的灵人同在。但紧接着，这些灵人就跟我搭讪，告诉我他们当时处于什么状态，也就是说，在这种状态下，他们只知道正在思考的是他们。他们确实告诉我，离我最近的灵人，完全确信是他们自己在思考；而离得远的，不那么确信；离得更远的，更不那么确信。我还被指示是哪些社群流入作为他们使臣的灵人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6194</b></p><p><b>6194.</b>
It has sometimes happened that I have meditated by myself, and have also talked with others, without reflecting that spirits were present who excited these activities. But directly afterward the spirits 
accosted me, and told me the state in which they had then been, namely, that they knew no otherwise than that they were the ones who were thinking, and this in my case in such a manner that the nearest 
believed themselves to be absolutely those who were thinking, but the more remote less so, and they who were still more remote, still less so. And it was also shown what societies flowed into the 
spirits as into their subjects. </p>

Sometimes it has happened that I have been thinking to myself or else talking to others without reflecting that spirits were present who prompted what I thought or said. But immediately afterwards the 
spirits spoke to me, telling me what their state was at the time, namely one in which they knew no other than that it was they who did the thinking. They told me indeed that those closest to me were 
fully convinced that they themselves did the thinking, but that those further away were not so convinced and those still further away even less so. I was also shown which particular communities flowed 
into the spirits as their subordinates. </p>

</p><b>6194.</b>
Aliquoties contigerat quod cogitaverim mecum, et quoque quod locutus cum aliis absque reflexione quod spiritus adessent qui excitarent sed ilico post alloquebantur me spiritus et narrabant statum in 
quo tunc fuerunt, quod nempe non aliter scirent quam quod ii essent qui cogitarent, et quidem apud me ita quod proximi crederent se esse prorsus qui cogitabant, remotiores autem minus, et qui adhuc remotiores 
adhuc minus:  et quoque ostensum, quaenam societates in spiritus, ut in sua subjecta, influerent. </p>
