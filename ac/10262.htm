<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10262节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10262</strong>.“一欣”表足够结合所需的量。这从“一欣”的含义清楚可知，“一欣”，也就是液体的度量单位，此处即油的度量单位，是指足够结合所需的量。“油”表示主的属天神性良善，这良善是将天堂里的一切事物联结在一起的本质能力；因此，油的度量单位表示足够结合所需的量，以它们结合在一起的一切或完全。主的神性属天良善之所以是将一切事物联结在一起的本质能力，是因为它是一切事物所拥有的生命的本质存在。事实上，神性良善通过从它自己发出的神性真理将生命赋予一切事物；它照着凡接受它之物的特定品质而将生命赋予它们。天使是接受者；世人也是接受者。他们所拥有的真理和良善形成他们的特定品质，这取决于发生在他们里面的接受，因而取决于结合。<br />在圣言中，经上提到了两种为了神圣的功用或目的所用到的度量单位；一种用于液体，被称为欣，另一种用于干物质，被称为伊法。欣用来量油和酒，伊法用来量面和细面。用来量油和酒的欣分为四份，而伊法分为十份。欣分成四份，是为了它可以表示将事物联结在一起的东西，因为“四”表示联结或结合。而伊法分为十份，是为了它可以表示接受，其性质或品质用数字来表明；因为“十”表示大量、全部或一切，以及完整或完全之物。“四”表示联结或结合（参看<a href="8877.htm">8877</a>，<a href="9601.htm">9601</a>，<a href="9674.htm">9674</a>，<a href="10136.htm">10136</a>，<a href="10137.htm">10137</a>节）；“十”表示大量、全部或一切，以及完整或完全之物，“一百”也是（<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="3107.htm">3107</a>，<a href="4400.htm">4400</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>，<a href="8468.htm">8468</a>，<a href="8540.htm">8540</a>，<a href="9745.htm">9745</a>，<a href="10253.htm">10253</a>节）。<br />“欣”用于献祭用的油和酒，分为四份；而“伊法”用于制作献祭用的素祭的面和细面，分为十份，这一点清楚可见于相关经文（即出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.40.htm">29:40</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.11.htm">5:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.13.htm">23:13</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.3.htm">15:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.10.htm">10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.5.htm">28:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.14.htm">14</a>）。由此明显可知，“一欣”表示足够结合所需的量，而“一伊法”表示足够接受所需的量。此外，油用来将细面结合在一起，而细面则接受油；因为素祭是由油和细面构成的。<br />除此之外还有其它度量单位，是干物质和液体所共用的。干物质的度量单位被称为贺梅珥和俄梅珥，液体的度量单位被称为柯珥和罢特。一贺梅珥含十伊法，一伊法含十俄梅珥；但一柯珥含十罢特，一罢特含更小的十份；关于这一切可参看出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.36.htm">16:36</a>）和以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.11.htm">45:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.13.htm">45:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.24.htm">45:24</a>）。<br />但在以西结书论述新殿的地方，却出现了伊法和罢特的不同划分。在那里，伊法和罢特不是被分为十份，而是分为了六份；那里的欣则与伊法相对应，这明显可见于以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.13.htm">45:13-14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.24.htm">45:24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.5.htm">46:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.7.htm">45:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.11.htm">45:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.14.htm">45:14</a>）。原因在于，那里论述的主题不是属天良善及其将事物联结在一起的能力，而是属灵良善及其将事物联结在一起的能力；在属灵国度。数字“十二”、“六”和“三”具有对应关系，因为这些数字表示一切事物，当论及真理和良善时，它们表示整体上真理和良善的一切方面或一切事物。这些事物由“十二”来表示（参看<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）；也由“六”来表示（<a href="3960.htm">3960</a>e，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>，<a href="10217.htm">10217</a>节）; 同样由“三”来表示，“三”表示从开始到结束，因而表示完整或完全之物，就真实事物而言，表示一切或全部（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="5159.htm">5159</a>，<a href="7715.htm">7715</a>，<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>，<a href="10127.htm">10127</a>节）。这些数字之所以涉及相同的事物，是因为更大的数字和通过相乘得到它们的简单数具有相同的含义（参看<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）。<br />由于“欣”也表示足够与属灵真理结合所需的量，所以献公绵羊时为素祭取一欣油的三分之一，为奠祭取酒的三分之一（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.6.htm">15:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.7.htm">7</a>）；因为“公绵羊”表示属灵良善（<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>，<a href="9991.htm">9991</a>节）。由此可以再次清楚看出，圣言中所提到的数字表示真实事物。否则，摩西五经、以西结书和其它地方如此频繁地用数字来具体说明数量和度量又有什么目的或原因呢？</p>

A hin. That this signifies the amount sufficient for conjunction, is evident from the signification of a "hin," which was a measure of liquids, here of oil, as being the amount sufficient for conjunction; 
for by "oil" is signified the Lord's Divine celestial good, which is the very conjunctive of all in the heavens; hence by its measure is signified the amount sufficient for conjunction, and everything 
of conjunction. The Lord's Divine celestial good is the very conjunctive of all, because it is the very being of the life of all; for it vivifies all things by means of the Divine truth that proceeds 
from this Divine good, and it vivifies them according to the quality of the reception. Angels are receptions, and so also are men; the truths and goods with them afford the quality according to 
which is effected the reception, thus the conjunction. [2] Two measures are mentioned in the Word, which were in holy use, one for liquids, which was called the "hin," the other for dry things, which 
was called the "ephah;" by the hin were measured oil and wine, and by the ephah, meal and fine flour; the measure hin, which was for oil and wine, was divided into four parts, but the measure ephah 
was divided into ten. The reason why the measure hin was divided into four, was that it might signify what is conjunctive, for "four" denotes conjunction; but that the measure ephah was divided into ten 
was that it might signify what is receptive, the quality whereof was marked by the numbers, for "ten" signifies much, all, and what is full. (That "four" denotes conjunction, see n. 8877, 9601, 9674, 
10136, 10137; and that "ten" denotes much, all, and what is full, the same as a "hundred," n. 1988, 3107, 4400, 4638, 8468, 8540, 9745, 10253.)  [3] (That the measure "hin" was for oil and wine in 
the sacrifices, and that it was divided into four; but that the measure "ephah" was for meal and fine meal, which were for the meat-offering in the sacrifices, and that this was divided into ten, can 
be seen in Exod. 29:40; Lev. 5:11; 23:13; Num. 15:3-10; 28:5, 7, 14.) From all this it is evident that by a "hin" is signified the amount sufficient for conjunction, and by an "ephah" the amount sufficient 
for reception. Moreover, the oil conjoined the fine flour, and the flour received it, for in the meat-offering there were oil and fine flour. [4] There were other measures besides, which were 
in common use both for dry things and for liquids; the dry measures were called the "homer" and the "omer," and the liquid measures the "cor" and the "bath." The homer contained ten ephahs, and the ephah 
ten omers; but the cor contained ten baths, and the bath ten lesser parts (concerning which see Exod. 16:36; Ezek. 45:11, 13, 24). [5] But in Ezekiel, where the new temple is treated of, there appears 
a different division of the ephah and the bath; the ephah and the bath not being there divided into ten, but into six; and the hin there corresponds to the ephah, as is plain in this prophet (Ezek. 
45:13, 14, 24; 46:5, 7, 11, 14). The reason is that the subject there treated of is not celestial good and its conjunction, but spiritual good and its conjunction; and in the spiritual kingdom the 
corresponding numbers are twelve, six, and three, because by these numbers are signified all things, and when they are predicated of truths and goods, all things of truth and of good in the complex. 
(That these things are signified by "twelve," see n. 3272, 3858, 3913, 7973; also by "six," n. 3960, 7973, 8148, 10217; in like manner by "three," by which is signified from beginning to end, thus what 
is full, and in respect to things, everything, n. 2788, 4495, 5159, 7715, 9825, 10127.) That these numbers involve similar things is because the greater numbers have a like signification with the simple 
ones from which they arise by multiplication (see n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973). [6] As by the "hin" is signified the amount sufficient for conjunction with spiritual truth also, therefore likewise 
for the meat-offering in the sacrifices from the ram, there was taken a third part of a hin of oil, and for the drink-offering a third part of wine (Num. 15:6, 7); for by the "ram" is signified spiritual 
good (n. 2830, 9991). From all this it is now again clearly evident that by the numbers mentioned in the Word are signified real things; otherwise to what purpose would have been so frequent a designation 
of quantity and measure by means of numbers in Moses, in Ezekiel, and elsewhere? </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10262</b></p><p><b>10262.</b>
'A hin' means how far things are joined together. This is clear from the meaning of 'a hin' - which was a liquid measure, at this point a measure of oil - as the extent to which things are joined together. 
'Oil' means the Lord's celestial Divine Good, which is the essential power that binds all things together in heaven; consequently the measure of the oil means how far things are joined together, 
and the fullness of their being joined together. The reason why the Lord's celestial Divine Good is the essential power that binds all things together is that it is the essential being (ipsum esse) 
of the life that all things have. For that Divine Good imparts life to all things through the Divine Truth emanating from itself; and it imparts life in accordance with the specific character of whatever 
receives it. Angels are recipients; so too are people in the world. The truths and forms of good they have form their specific character, and this conditions the reception that takes place within 
them, and so conditions any joining together.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Two measures which were used for sacred purposes are mentioned in the Word; one was for liquids, which was called the hin, the other was for dry substances, 
which was called the ephah. The hin served to measure oil and wine, and the ephah to measure flour and fine flour. The hin, used for oil and wine, was divided into four, whereas the ephah was 
divided into ten. The reason why the hin was divided into four was in order that it might mean that which binds things together; for 'four' means a joining together. But the reason why the ephah was 
divided into ten was in order that it might mean reception, the nature of which was indicated by the numbers; for 'ten' means much, all, and what is complete.  </p>
<p>'Four' means a joining together, see <a href="8877.htm">8877</a>, <a href="9601.htm">9601</a>, <a href="9674.htm">9674</a>, <a href="10136.htm">10136</a>, <a href="10137.htm">10137</a>.  'Ten' means much, all, and what is complete, as 'a hundred' does, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="3107.htm">3107</a>, <a href="4400.htm">4400</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, <a href="8468.htm">8468</a>, <a href="8540.htm">8540</a>, <a href="9745.htm">9745</a>, <a href="10253.htm">10253</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the hin was used for the oil 
and wine in the sacrifices, and was divided into four, whereas the ephah was used for the flour and fine flour, which were for the minchah in the sacrifices, and that it was divided into ten, becomes 
clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:40</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%205:11;%2023:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 5:11; 23:13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:3-10;%2028:5,7,14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:3-10; 28:5,7,14</a>. From these verses it is evident that 'a hin' means the extent to which things are joined together, and 'an ephah' the amount of reception. 
Furthermore the oil served to bind the fine flour together, and the fine flour to receive the oil; for a minchah consisted of oil and fine flour.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In addition there were other measures that 
were used for ordinary purposes, both for dry substances and for liquids. The measures for dry substances were called the homer and the omer, and the measures for liquids the cor and the bath. A homer 
contained ten ephahs, and an ephah ten omers, whereas a cor contained ten baths, and a bath ten smaller parts; regarding all these, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2016:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 16:36</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:11,13,24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:11,13,24</a>. </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But where the new temple 
is dealt with in Ezekiel a different division of the ephah and the bath occurs. There the ephah and the bath are divided not into ten but into six, and the hin corresponds to the ephah, as is evident 
in the same prophet, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:13,14,24;%2046:5,7,11,14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:13,14,24; 46:5,7,11,14</a>. The reason for this is that in those places the subject is not celestial good and its ability to bind things together, but spiritual good and 
its ability to do so; and the numbers 'twelve', 'six', and 'three' have their correspondence in the spiritual kingdom, because they mean all and, when used in reference to truths and forms of good, mean 
all aspects of truth and good in their entirety. The fact that these are meant by 'twelve', see <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, also by 'six', <a href="3960.htm">3960</a>(end), <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, <a href="10217.htm">10217</a>; and in like manner 'three', by which 
from beginning to end, thus what is complete, is meant, and - in respect of real things - all, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="5159.htm">5159</a>, <a href="7715.htm">7715</a>, <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>, <a href="10127.htm">10127</a>. The reason why these numbers imply similar things is that larger 
numbers are similar in meaning to the simple ones which when multiplied produce them, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Since 'a hin' also means how far something is joined to spiritual truth, a third 
part of a hin of oil was taken for the minchah in the sacrifices of a ram, and a third part of wine for the drink offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:6,7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:6,7</a>; for spiritual good is meant by 'a ram', <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>, <a href="9991.htm">9991</a>. From all this 
it is again plainly evident that numbers are used in the Word to mean real things. What other reason could there be for the numbers used so often in Moses, Ezekiel, and elsewhere to specify amounts 
and measures?  </p>

`Hinem': quod significet conjunctionis quantum, constat ex significatione `hinis' quae erat mensura liquidorum, hic olei, quod sit conjunctionis quantum, per `oleum' enim significatur Divinum Bonum 
caeleste Domini, quod est ipsum conjunctivum omnium in caelis, inde per mensuram ejus significatur conjunctionis quantum, et conjunctionis omne. Quod Divinum Bonum caeleste Domini sit ipsum conjunctivum 
omnium, est quia id est ipsum esse vitae omnium; vivificat enim omnia per Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino illo Bono, et vivificat secundum receptionis quale; angeli sunt receptiones, et quoque homines; 
vera et bona apud illos dant quale {1}, secundum id enim fit receptio, ita conjunctio. 	[2] {2} Binae mensurae quae in usu sancto, memorantur in Verbo, una pro liquidis, quae vocabatur hin, altera 
pro siccis, quae vocabatur ephah; per hinem mensurabatur oleum et vinum, et per epham farina {3}et simila; mensura hin, quae pro oleo et vino, dividebatur in quattuor, at mensura ephah dividebatur 
in decem; quod mensura hin divisa fuerit in quattuor, erat causa ut significaret conjunctivum, nam quattuor sunt conjunctio; quod autem mensura ephah divisa fuerit in decem, erat causa ut significaret 
receptivum, cujus quale designabatur per numeros, nam `decem' significant multum, omne, et plenum; quod `quattuor' sint conjunctio, videatur n. 8877, 9601, 9674, 10,136, 10,137 et quod `decem' sint 
multum, omne, et plenum, aeque ac centum, n. 1988, 3107, 4400, 4638, 8468, 8540, 9745, 10,253. 	[3] Quod mensura hin fuerit pro oleo et vino in sacrificiis, et quo divisa fuerit in quattuor, mensura 
autem ephah pro (d)farina et simila, quae pro minhah in sacrificiis, et quod divisa fuerit in decem, constare potest in Exodo xxix 40; in Lev. v 11, xxiii 13; in Num. xv 3-10, xxviii 5, 7, 14. Ex his 
patet quod per `hinem' significetur quantum conjunctionis, et per `epham' quantum receptionis; oleum etiam conjungebat similam, et haec recepit, nam in minhah erat oleum et simila. 	[4] Erant praeterea 
aliae mensurae quae in communi usu, tam pro siccis quam pro liquidis; mensurae pro siccis vocabantur homer et omer, et mensurae pro liquidis korus et bathus; homer continebat decem ephas, et ephah 
decem omeres; korus {4}autem continebat decem bathos, et bathus decem minores partes, de quibus videatur [5] Exod. xvi 36; Ezech. xlv 11, 13, 24; at apud Ezechielem, ubi {5}de novo templo, exstat alia 
divisio ephae et bathi, ibi ephah et bathus non dividuntur in decem, sed in sex; (c)et hin ibi correspondet ephae, ut {6}patet apud illum prophetam xlv 13, 14, 24, xlvi 5, 7, 11, 14; causa est quia 
ibi non agitur de bono caelesti et ejus conjunctione, sed de bono spirituali et hujus conjunctione, et (d)in regno spirituali correspondent numeri duodecim, sex, et tria, quoniam per {7}illos significantur 
omnia, et cum praedicantur de veris et bonis, omnia veri et boni in complexu; quod illa significentur per `duodecim,' videatur n. 3272, 3858, 3913, 7973, quod etiam per `sex,' n. 3960 fin., 7973, 
8148, 10,217, similiter per `tria,' per qui significatur a principio ad finem, ita plenum, et quoad res, omne, n. 2788, 4495, 5159, 7715, 9825, 10,127; quod hi numeri {8}similia involvant, est quia 
numeri majores simile (x)significant cum simplicibus a quibus per multiplicationem existunt, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973. 	[6] Quoniam per `hinem' significatur quantum conjunctionis etiam cum vero spirituali, 
ideo quoque ad minham {9}in sacrificiis ex ariete (x)sumebatur tertia pars hinis olei, et ad libamen tertia pars vini, Num. xv 6, 7, per `arietem' enim significatur bonum spirituale, n. 2830, 
9991. Ex his nunc iterum manifeste patet quod per numeros in Verbo significentur res; ad quid alioquin {10}fuisset designatio quantitatis et mensurae per numeros toties apud Moschen, et {11} apud Ezechielem,
