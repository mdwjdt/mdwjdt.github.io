<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7344节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7344.</strong>“因为他们不能喝这河里的水”表不能通过纯粹的虚假应用。这从“不能喝”和“河里的水”的含义清楚可知：“不能喝”是指不能应用，因为“喝”是指应用（参看<a href="7343.htm">7343</a>节）；“河里的水”是指虚假，如前所述（<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>节）。“不能喝这河里的水”表示真理不能被应用于纯粹的虚假，也就是说，不能通过纯粹的虚假被歪曲，这一点从前文的内义也可推知，即“在河周围挖水喝”是指找寻他们能应用于虚假的真理。真理之所以不能通过纯粹的虚假被应用于虚假，是因为真理和虚假完全是对立面，对立面无法被应用，除非有联结它们的居间物。联结它们的居间物就是外在感官的幻觉，以及圣言中照表象所说的话。举个例子，除了良善外，没有什么东西是来自于主的，任何邪恶的事物从来不是来自于主。这个真理通过幻觉被歪曲，如主若愿意，就能凭祂的全能拿走邪恶；祂因不拿走它，故是邪恶的缘由；这意味着邪恶也来自主。这一点通过运用圣言中照着表象所说的话被歪曲，如耶和华或主发怒、惩罚、定罪，投入地狱；而事实上，是专注于邪恶的人向自己这样行，由此给自己招开惩罚的邪恶；因为在来世，惩罚的邪恶和罪责的邪恶是在一起的。其它无数真理也能这样的方式被歪曲。</p>

For they could not drink of the waters of the river. That this signifies no application from mere falsities, is evident from the signification of "not being able to drink," as being no application (that 
"to drink" is to apply, see just above, n. 7343); and from the signification of "the waters of the river," as being falsities (of which also above, n. 7307). That by "not being able to drink of the 
waters of the river" is signified that truths cannot be applied to mere falsities, that is, cannot be falsified by mere falsities, follows also from the internal sense of what immediately precedes, 
namely, "digging waters to drink round about the river," as being to search out truths which they might apply to falsities. That truths cannot be applied to falsities by mere falsities, is because truths 
and falsities are absolute opposites, and opposites cannot be applied unless there are intermediates which conjoin. The intermediates which conjoin are the fallacies of the external senses, and also 
the things that have been said in the Word according to the appearance. Take for example, that nothing but what is good is from the Lord, and never anything that is evil; this truth is falsified by 
the fallacies that the Lord can take away evil if He will, by His omnipotence, and that because He does not take it away, He is therefore the cause of it, and thus evil too is from the Lord; and by what 
has been said in the Word according to the appearance, that Jehovah or the Lord is angry, punishes, condemns, casts into hell; when yet it is those who are in evil who do this to themselves, and thereby 
bring upon themselves the evil of punishment; for in the other life the evil of punishment and the evil of guilt are conjoined. So in innumerable other cases. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7344</b></p><p><b>7344.</b>
'For they could not drink from the waters of the river' means non-application through the use of utter falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'being unable to drink' as non-application, for 'drinking' 
is applying, see immediately above in <a href="7343.htm">7343</a>; and from the meaning of 'the waters of the river' as falsities, also dealt with above, in <a href="7307.htm">7307</a> What is meant by 'being unable to drink from the waters 
of the river' - which is that truths cannot be applied to falsities, that is, be falsified through the use of utter falsities - follows on also from the internal sense of what comes immediately before. 
That is to say, this meaning follows on from that of 'digging for water to drink round about the river', which is a searching for truths that they could apply to falsities. The reason why utter falsities 
cannot be used to apply truths to falsities is that they are intermediaries are present to bind them together. The intermediaries which bind them together are the illusions of the outward senses, 
and also statements made in the Word in accordance with outward appearances. Take for example the truth that nothing but good comes from the Lord, and never anything evil. This truth is falsified 
through illusions, such as that by His almighty power the Lord is able, if He wills, to take away evil, and that because He does not take it away He is the cause of it, which implies that evil too comes 
from the Lord. It is falsified by the use of statements made in the Word in accordance with outward appearances, such as that Jehovah or the Lord is angry, punishes, condemns, and casts into hell, 
when in actual fact the people themselves who are engrossed in evil are the ones who cause these things to happen to them. Consequently they bring upon themselves the evil inflicted as punishment, for 
in the next life the evil inflicted as punishment and the evil of which a person is guilty go together. Countless other truths can be falsified in ways like these. </p>

`Quia non potuerunt bibere ex aquis fluvii':  quod significet non applicationem ex meris falsis, constat ex significatione non posse bibere' quod sit non applicatio; quod `bibere' sit applicare, videatur 
mox supra n. 7343; et ex significatione `aquarum fluvii' quod sint falsa, de qua etiam supra n. 7307; quod (d)per `non posse bibere ex aquis fluvii' {1}significetur quod vera non applicari possint 
meris falsis, hoc est, falsificari per mera falsa, etiam sequitur ex sensu interno mox praecedentium, nempe `fodere aquas ad bibendum circum fluvium' quod sit investigare vera quae applicarent falsis. 
 Quod vera non applicari falsis possint per mera falsa, est quia vera et falsa prorsus {2}opposita sunt, et opposita non applicari possunt nisi sint intermedia quae conjungunt; intermedia quae conjungant 
sunt fallaciae {3}sensuum externorum, et sunt quoque illa {4}quae in Verbo secundum apparentiam dicta (d)sunt; sit pro exemplo, quod nihil nisi quam bonum sit a Domino, et nusquam aliquod malum; 
hoc verum falsificatur per fallacias {5}, quod Dominus possit auferre malum si velit, ex omnipotentia, et quia non aufert, quod causa ejus sit ac ita etiam malum a Domino sit; ex {6}illis quae secundum 
apparentiam dicta sunt in Verbo, quod Jehovah seu Dominus irascatur, puniat, condemnet, conjiciat in infernum, cum tamen sunt ipsi qui in malo sunt qui hoc sibi faciunt, et inde sibi inducunt malum 
poenae, nam malum poenae et malum culpae in altera vita conjuncta sunt; similiter in innumeris aliis {7}. 	1 significet 	2 in opposito 	3 quae sensuum 	4 ex Verbo, quae in sensu literae sunt, 	5 
i, et per sensum literae Verbi, per fallacias 	6 sensu literae Verbi 	7 i, nam non datur aliquod verum, quod non falsificari potest </p>
