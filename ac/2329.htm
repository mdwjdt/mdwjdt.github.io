<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2329节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2329.</strong>“说，看哪，我主啊”表对主的神圣人性和神圣活动的一种内在承认和表白。这从刚才所说的承认和谦卑清楚可知。此处的表白紧随它们而来，因为这就是罗得说“看哪，我主啊”所表示的。内在表白发自内心，并且表现为谦卑，同时表现为对良善的情感；而外在表白只是口头上的，并且有可能表现为一种虚假的谦卑和一种虚假的对良善的情感，而这善根本就没有，如那些为了自己的名声，确切地说为了自我崇拜，以及自己的功利而承认主之人所具有的良善。这些人发自内心拒绝接受他们口头上所宣称的。<br />“我主”用的是复数形式，原因和前一章所说的那“三个人”是一样的。因为正如那里的那“三个人”表示主的神性本身，神圣人性和神圣活动，此处的这“两个”表示主的神圣人性和神圣活动，如前所述。教会中人都知道，这些构成一体，并且由于他们为一，故下文以单数形式提及他们。如17节：“领他们出来以后，祂说，逃命吧”；19节：“看哪，你仆人既然在你眼前蒙恩，你又向我大施怜悯”；21节：“他对罗得说，看哪，这事我也应允你，我不倾覆这城”；22节：“因为你还没有到那里，我不能作什么”。<br />神性本身，神圣人性和神圣活动就是耶和华，这从前一章明显看出来，在那里，这三个人被称为“耶和华”。如13节：“耶和华对亚伯拉罕说”；14节：“耶和华岂有难成的事吗”；22节：“但亚伯拉罕仍旧站在耶和华面前”；33节：“耶和华与亚伯拉罕说完话就走了”。所以，神圣人性和神圣活动就是耶和华，如在本章24节，“耶和华”这个名字也用于这二人：“当时，耶和华将硫磺与火，从天上耶和华那里，降与所多玛和蛾摩拉”；这些话的内义可见于下文。<br />真正的教会成员，也就是凡被对主之爱和对邻之仁所主导的，都熟知并承认三位一体。但他们仍在面前谦卑自己，并唯独崇拜祂。因为他们知道若不通过子，就没有办法接受神性，即所谓的“父”，圣灵所拥有的一切神圣皆从祂发出。当具有这种观念时，他们只敬拜祂（万物皆经由祂并通过拥有其存在），因而只敬拜那一位存在者。他们也不会将其观念分散于三位中，如很多教会中人惯常所做的那样。<br />这从来世的很多人明显看出来，包括一些学者，他们在世时自以为比其他人掌握更多信的奥秘。在来世，当这些人被查看他们对一位神（是否有三位非受造的，三位无限者，三位永恒者，三位全能者，三位主）具有何种观念时，就能很明显地发觉他们具有三位存在者的观念（因为在来世，各种观念都是可以交流的）。即便信经明确声明没有三位非受造的，或三位无限者，或三位永恒者，或三位全能者，或三位主，而是一位（这也是真理），他们仍具有这种观念。结果，他们口头上宣称他们的确说过神只有一位，然而仍思想（一些人甚至相信）有三位，并且在他们的观念里，这三位是分开的，而非联结起来。其原因在于，一切艰深的知识，甚至最深的，都伴随一种观念。因为若不具有一种观念，就不可能思想任何东西，事实上，也没有任何东西能保存在记忆中。<br />因此，在来世，每个人为自己所形成的有关一位神的思维，因而信仰如在晴天白日下那样清楚。事实上，在来世，当犹太人听说主就是耶和华，并且那里只有一位神时，他们什么也说不出。但当他们发觉基督徒的观念分裂为三位时，他们说，他们自己敬拜一位神，而基督徒却敬拜一位。而且，除了那些拥有仁之信的人外，没人能在观念上将这三者联结起来，而是将其分开。因为主使这些人的心智适应祂自己。</p>

He said, Behold I pray my lords. That this signified an interior acknowledgment and confession of the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, is evident from the acknowledgment and humiliation spoken 
of just before; here confession immediately follows, for this is meant by Lot's saying, "Behold I pray my lords." Interior confession is of the heart and comes forth in humiliation, and at the same 
time in the affection of good; but exterior confession is of the lips, and may possibly come forth in a feigned humiliation and a feigned affection of good, which is none at all, being such as exists 
with those who confess the Lord for the sake of their own honor, or rather their own worship, and their own gain. That which these confess with the lips, they deny in the heart.  [2] Its being said in 
the plural, "my lords," is for the same reason that in the preceding chapter it is said "three men;" for just as the "three" there signify the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding, 
so here the "two" signify the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, as was said above. That these are one is known to everyone within the church; and because they are one, they are also named in 
the singular in what follows, as in verse 17, "It came to pass when they had led them forth abroad, that He said, Escape for thy life;" verse 19, "Behold I pray thy servant hath found grace in thine 
eyes, and thou hast made thy mercy great which thou hast done with me;" verse 21, "And he said unto him, Behold I have accepted thy face as to this word also, that I will not overthrow the city;" and 
verse 22, "For I cannot do anything until thou be come thither."  [3] That the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding are Jehovah, is evident from the foregoing chapter, where the three 
men are called "Jehovah," as in verse 13, "Jehovah said unto Abraham;" verse 14," Shall anything be too wonderful for Jehovah;" verse 22, "Abraham, he stood yet before Jehovah;" verse 33, "Jehovah 
went His way when He made an end of speaking with Abraham." Consequently the Divine Human and Holy proceeding are Jehovah, as also He is named in this chapter, verse 24, "And Jehovah caused it to rain 
upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;" the internal sense of which words will be seen in what follows. (That the Lord is Jehovah Himself, who is so often named in the 
histories and prophecies of the Old Testament, may be seen above, n. 1736.)  [4] They who are truly men of the church, that is, who are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, are 
acquainted with and acknowledge a Trine; but still they humble themselves before the Lord and adore Him alone, for the reason that they know that there is no access to the Divine Itself which is called 
the "Father" except through the Son; and that all the Holy which is of the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him. When they are in this idea they adore no other than Him through whom and from whom all things 
are, thus One; [5] nor do they spread out their ideas among Three, as many within the church are wont to do, as can be seen from many in the other life, even the learned, who in the life of the body 
had supposed that they possessed the arcana of faith more than others. When these were explored in the other life as to what idea they had concerning the one God-whether of Three Uncreates, Three Infinities, 
Three Eternals, Three Almighties, Three Lords, it was plainly perceived that they had the idea of Three (for there is a communication of ideas there), when yet it is part of the creed, being 
stated in plain words, that there are not Three Uncreates, not Three Infinities, not Three Eternals, not Three Almighties, not Three Lords, but One; as also is the truth. The result was that they confessed 
that with the mouth they had indeed said that there is one God, yet still had thought, and some had believed, that there are three, whom in idea they could separate, but not join together, the reason 
of which is that all arcana whatever, even the deepest, are attended with an idea; for without an idea nothing can be thought of, nor indeed can anything be kept in the memory.  [6] Hence in the 
other life it is manifest as in clear day what thought, and thence what belief, each person has formed for himself concerning the One God. Indeed the Jews in the other life, when they hear that the 
Lord is Jehovah and that there is but One God, can say nothing. But when they perceive that the ideas of Christians are divided among Three, they say that they themselves worship One God, but Christians 
Three; and this the more since none can join together the Three thus separated in idea, except those who are in the faith of charity; for the Lord applies the minds of these to Himself. </p>

'He said, Behold now, my Lords' means interior acknowledgement and confession of the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. This is clear from the acknowledgement and humiliation already referred 
to just above. Confession follows immediately after them here, for confession is meant by his saying, 'Behold now, my Lords'. Interior confession belongs to the heart, and manifests itself in humiliation 
and at the same time in the affection for good, whereas exterior confession belongs to the lips, which may manifest itself in a spurious humiliation and a spurious affection for good which is none 
at all, as with people who confess the Lord for the sake of their own reputation or rather worship of self, and for the sake of their own material gain. What these people confess with the lips they 
deny in the heart. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The plural 'my Lords' is used for the same reason that 'three men' are spoken of in the previous chapter. For just as the three there mean the Divine itself, the Divine Human, 
and the Holy proceeding, so the two mentioned here mean the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding, as stated above. That these make one is well known to anyone inside the Church, and because 
they make one they are also referred to in the singular further on, </p>
<p>So it was, when they had brought them outside, that he said, Escape for your life. Verse 17. </p>
<p>Behold now, your servant has found 
grace in your eyes, and you have magnified your mercy which you have shown to me. Verse 19. </p>
<p>And he said to him, Behold, I have accepted you as regards this matter also, that I will not overthrow 
the city. Verse 21. </p>
<p>For I cannot do anything until you come to it. Verse 22. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding are Jehovah is clear from the previous chapter, 
where in various places the three men are called Jehovah, namely, </p>
<p>Jehovah said to Abraham. Verse 13. Will anything be too wonderful for Jehovah? Verse 14. Abraham still stood before Jehovah. Verse 22. Jehovah departed, when He had finished speaking to Abraham. Verse 33. </p>
<p>Consequently the Divine Human and the Holy proceeding are Jehovah, for this name is used for both in verse 24 of the present 
chapter. </p>
<p>And Jehovah rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven. Verse 24. </p>
<p>The internal sense of these words will be seen later on. As regards the Lord being 
Jehovah Himself, who is mentioned so many times in the historical and prophetical sections of the Old Testament, see <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those who are truly members of the Church, that is, who are governed by 
love to the Lord and by charity towards the neighbour, know about and acknowledge the Trinity; but nevertheless they humble themselves before the Lord and worship Him alone. They do so because they 
know that there is no other way of reaching the Divine itself, called the Father, except through the Son, and that all the Holiness which the Holy Spirit possesses proceeds from Him. When this idea exists 
with them they worship none except Him, through whom and from whom all things have their being, and so worship One Being. Nor do they disperse their ideas among three, as many others inside the Church 
are wont to do.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This is evident from very many people in the next life, including some learned, who during their lifetime have presumed themselves to have a firmer grip on the arcana of 
faith than all others. When these people have been examined in the next life to see what idea they had had concerning the one God - whether there were three Uncreated, three Infinites, three Eternals, 
three Almighties, and three Lords - it was quite obvious that they had had the idea of three beings (for in that world the communication of ideas takes place). They have had that idea even though the 
creed states explicitly that there are not three Uncreated, or three Infinites, or three Eternals, or three Almighties, or three Lords, but one - which is also the truth. They accordingly confessed that 
with their lips they had indeed spoken of God being one; but in spite of this they had thought of - and some had believed in - three whom they could separate in idea but not join together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
The reason is that for all arcana, even the deepest, some idea exists, for without the existence of an idea nothing is able to be thought about nor indeed anything retained in the memory. In the next 
life therefore the nature of the thought, and consequently of the faith, that anyone has formulated for himself concerning the One God is clear as daylight. Indeed when Jews in the next life hear that 
the Lord is Jehovah and that only one God exists they have nothing to say; but when they perceive that Christians' ideas are divided into three they say that they themselves worship one God whereas Christians 
worship three. What is more, nobody is able to join together three thus separated in idea except those who have the faith that comes with charity- for the Lord accommodates their minds to Himself. </p>

`Dixit, Ecce quaeso Domini mei': quod significet interiorem agnitionem et confessionem Divini Humani et Sancti procedentis Domini, constat ex agnitione et humiliatione, de qua mox prius; hic confessio 
immediate sequitur, (s)nam confessio est quod dicat, `ecce quaeso Domini mei': confessio interior est cordis, et existit in humiliatione et simul in affectione boni; confessio autem exterior est oris 
et existere potest in ficta humiliatione, et in ficta affectione boni, quae est nulla, ut apud eos qui confitentur Dominum sui honoris seu potius sui cultus, ac sui lucri causa; ii quod confitentur 
ore, negant corde.'  [2] Quod dicatur in plurali, Domini mei {1}, est ex eadem causa ex qua in (t)praecedente capite dicuntur tres viri, quia sicut ibi `tres' significant Ipsum Divinum, Humanum Divinum 
et Sanctum procedens, ita hic `duo' significant Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini, ut supra dictum est; illa quod unum sint, unicuique intra Ecclesiam notum est; et quia unum sunt, etiam in 
sequentibus nominantur in singulari, ut vers. 17 `Fuit, cum educerent ii illos, et dixit, Eripe te super anima tua': vers. 19 `Ecce quaeso invenit servus tuus gratiam in oculis tuis, et magnam fecisti 
misericordiam tuam, quam fecisti mecum': vers. 21 `Et dixit ad eum, Ecce acceptavi faciem tuam etiam quoad verbum hoc, quod non evertam urbem': vers. 22 `Quia non possum facere quicquam, usque venire 
te illuc.'  [3] Quod Divinum Ipsum, Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens sit Jehovah, constat ex capite praecedente, ubi tres viri passim dicuntur Jehovah, nempe ibi vers. 13 `Dixit Jehovah ad Abrahamum': 
vers. 14 `Num mirabile erit pro Jehovah quicquam': vers. 22 `Abraham adhuc stans coram Jehovah': vers. 33 `ivit Jehovah, quando absolvit loqui ad Abrahamum.'  Consequenter est Divinum Humanum 
et Sanctum procedens Jehovah, ut quoque nominatur in hoc capite, vers. 24 `Et Jehovah pluere fecit super Sodomam et Amoram sulphur et ignem a cum Jehovah e caelo,' de quorum sensu interno videbitur in 
sequentibus; quod Dominus sit Ipse Jehovah Qui toties nominatur {2} in Historicis et Propheticis Veteris Testamenti, videatur n. 1736.  [4] Qui vere homines Ecclesiae sunt, hoc est, qui in amore in Dominum 
e in charitate erga proximum sunt, Trinum norunt et agnoscant, se usque coram Domino se humiliant, et Ipsum solum adorant, ex causa quia sciunt quod nullus accessus sit ad Ipsum Divinum quod Pater 
dicitur, quam per Filium, et quod omne Sanctum quod Spiritus Sancti est, ab Ipso procedat; in qua idea cum sunt, non alium adorant quam per quem et a quo omnia, ita Unum, nec diffundunt ideas in tres 
ut multi alii intra Ecclesiam solent; [5] quod constare potest a pluribus in altera vita, etiam ab eruditis, qui prae aliis fidei arcana se possedisse in vita corporis putarunt; ii in altera vita 
explorati, quam ideam habuerint de Deo uno, num tres Increati, num tres Infiniti, num tres Aeterni, num tres Omnipotentes, et num tres Domini, et apperceptum manifeste quod ideam trium habuerint, nam 
idearum datur ibi communicatio; cum tamen ex fide symbolica, ubi apertis verbis dicitur, sit quod non tres Increati, non tres Infiniti, non tres Aeterni, non tres Omnipotentes, non tres Domini, sed Unus, 
sicut etiam est; ita fassi, quod ore quidem dixerint, Unum esse Deum, sed usque cogitaverint, et quidam crediderint tres, quos separare idea, non conjungere, possent; [6] causa inde est quia arcana 
quaecumque, immo arcanissima, secum habent ideam, nam absque idea nihil cogitari potest, ne quidem aliquid memoria teneri: inde in altera vita, sicut in clara die patet qualem unusquisque sibi cogitationem, 
et inde fidem, de Uno Deo formavit.  Immo Judaei in altera vita, cum audiunt Dominum esse Jehovam, et non esse nisi Unum Deum, nihil possunt dicere; at cum percipiunt Christianorum ideas partitas 
esse in tres, dicunt se colere Unum Deum, sed illos tres; ac eo magis cum tres in idea separatos non possint alii conjungere quam qui in fide charitatis sunt, nam horum mentem Dominus applicat Sibi. 	@1
