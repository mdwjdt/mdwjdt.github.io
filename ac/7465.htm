<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7465节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7465.</strong>“使讨厌的苍蝇离开法老和法老的臣仆并法老的百姓”表好叫涉及恶毒虚假的这种状态能有一个结束。这从“讨厌的苍蝇”和“他的臣仆并他的百姓”的含义，以及“法老”的代表清楚可知：“讨厌的苍蝇”是指恶毒的虚假；“他的臣仆并他的百姓”是指那些沉浸于由邪恶所生的虚假并进行侵扰的人，如前所述；“他的臣仆并他的百姓”是指他们当中的每一个人（<a href="7396.htm">7396</a>，<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）。从那些侵扰者当中的每一个人那里移除这些恶毒的虚假，是为了结束这种状态。要知道，在埃及所行的每个神迹都表示那些在来世沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人所进入的一个具体状态。他们在被完全剥夺一切真理，因而在被投入地狱之前，会相继进入十种状态。因为那些拥有信之知识，却过着邪恶生活的人死后不是立即，而是逐渐被带入地狱。首先向他们证明，他们陷入邪恶，然后信之知识从他们那里被夺走，最后他们只剩下自己所过的邪恶生活。这一切是通过一个接一个的众多状态实现的，这些状态就是在埃及所行的神迹，因而在埃及人淹死在红海之前临到他们身上的灾殃所描述的。这些奥秘若没有启示，是不可能为人所知的；但对天使来说，它们都是众所周知的事。</p>

That He may remove the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. That this signifies that there may be an end of this state in respect to the falsities of malevolence, is evident 
from the signification of "the noisome fly," as being falsities of malevolence (see n. 7441); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evils and infest (of which 
above); and from the signification of "his servants and his people," as being all and each (n. 7396, 7441). To remove these falsities of malevolence from all and each who infest, is to put an end to 
this state. Be it known that each miracle done in Egypt signifies a peculiar state into which those come who are in falsities and infest in the other life. There are ten states into which they successively 
come before they are entirely stripped of all truth, thus before they are cast into hell. For they who are in the knowledge of faith, but in evil of life, are not after death at once brought into 
hell, but successively. They are first convinced that they are in evil, and afterward the knowledge of faith is taken away from them, and at last they are left to the evil of their life. This is effected 
by means of many successive states, and these states are what are described by the miracles done in Egypt, consequently by the evils which befell the Egyptians before they were immersed in the 
sea Suph. These secrets cannot be known without revelation, but with the angels they are among things well known. </p>

'To remove the noxious flying insects from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people' means in order that there may be an end to that state involving the malevolent falsities. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'noxious flying insects' as malevolent falsities, dealt with in <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>; from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those who are steeped in falsities arising from evils and engage in molestation, 
dealt with previously; and from the meaning of 'his servants and his people' as every single one of them, dealt with in <a href="7396.htm">7396</a>, <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>. The removal of those malevolent falsities from every single 
one of those molesters brings that state to an end. It should be recognized that every miracle that was performed in Egypt means some particular state which those people enter who are steeped in falsities 
and are molesters in the next life. There are ten states, one after another, which they enter, before they are completely divested of all truth, thus before they are cast into hell. For those who 
have a knowledge of matters of belief yet lead an evil life are not after death conveyed immediately to hell but in successive stages towards it. First it is proved to them that they are governed by 
evil, then their knowledge of matters of belief is taken away from them, and finally they are left with the evil life they lead; and all this is effected by means of a number of states one after another. 
These states are the things described by the miracles performed in Egypt and therefore the bad things that happened to the Egyptians before they were drowned in the Sea Suph. Without revelation these 
arcana cannot be known; to angels they are some of the most familiar.  </p>

(x)  `Et removeat volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis illius, et a populo illius': quod significet ut finis sit illius status quoad falsa malevolentiae, constat ex significatione `volatilis noxii' quod 
sint falsa malevolentiae, de qua n. 7441; a repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint qui in falsis e malis ac infestant, de qua prius; et ex significatione `servorum ejus et populi ejus' quod sint omnes 
et singuli, de qua n. 7396, 7441; removere falsa illa malevolentiae ab omnibus et singulis qui infestant est finem imponere huic statui.  Sciendum est quod unumquodvis miraculum in Aegypto factum 
significet peculiarem statum in quem veniunt illi qui in falsis sunt ac infestant in altera vita; sunt decem status in quos successive veniunt, antequam prorsus exuuntur omni vero, ita antequam in infernum 
conjiciuntur; qui enim in scientia fidei sunt, {1}at in malo vitae, illi post mortem non statim feruntur in infernum, sed successive; convincuntur {2} primum quod in {3}malo sint, et postea aufertur 
illis scientia {4} fidei, et tandem relinquuntur malo vitae suae; hoc fit per plures status successivos; hi status sunt qui describuntur per miracula facta in Aegypto, proinde per mala quae Aegyptiis 
evenerunt antequam immersi sunt mari Suph; haec arcana non sciri possunt {5}absque revelatione; angelis inter notiora sunt. 	@1 et$ 	@2 i enim$ 	@3 falso sint ex malo$ 	@4 i veri$ 	@5 nisi ex$ </p>
