Verses 66, 67. And the servant told Isaac all the words that he had done. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent. And he took Rebekah, and she was to him for a woman, and he loved her; and 
Isaac was comforted after his mother. "The servant told Isaac all the words that he had done," signifies perception from the Divine natural, as to how the case was; "and Isaac brought her into his mother 
Sarah's tent," signifies the sanctuary of truth in the Divine Human; "and He took Rebekah, and she was to him for a woman, and he loved her," signifies conjunction; "and Isaac was comforted after 
his mother" signifies a new state. </p>

Verses 66, 67 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother; and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And 
Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother. </p>
<p>'The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done' means perception from the Divine Natural showing how real things stood now. 'And Isaac 
brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother' means the sanctuary of truth within the Divine Human. 'And he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her' means the joining together. 'And Isaac 
was comforted after [the death of] his mother' means a new state. </p>

Vers. 66, 67.  Et narrabat servus Jishako omnia verba quae fecit. Et introduxit illam Jishak in tentorium Sarae matris suae; et accepit Rebeccam, et erat ei in mulierem, et amavit illam; et consolatus 
est Jishakus post matrem suam. `Narrabat servus Jishako omnia verba quae fecit' significat perceptionem ex Divino Naturali quomodo se res haberet: `et introduxit illam Jishak in tentorium Sarae matris 
suae' significat sanctuarium veri in Divino Humano: `et accepit Rebeccam, et erat ei in mulierem, et amavit illam' significat conjunctionem: `et consolatus est Jishakus post matrem suam' significat 
statum novum. </p>
