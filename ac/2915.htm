<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2915节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2915.</strong>“我在你们中间是外人，是寄居的”表他们的最初状态，尽管他们不认识主，但主仍与他们同在。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表和“在你们中间是外人，是寄居的”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕”是指主，如前面频繁所述；“在你们中间是外人，是寄居的”是指他们不认识主，但主仍能与他们同在。从上下文明显可知，这就是内义。因为此处论述的是一个新教会，而本节则论述这个教会的最初状态。该状态是这样：首先，他们不认识主，但由于他们过着良善与仁爱的生活，在公共生活中公义公平，在私人生活中高尚体面，所以他们是主能与之同在的那种人。因为主在良善，因而在公义公平，并进一步在高尚体面中与人同在（高尚是一切美德的总和，体面不过是高尚所取的形式）。这些就是依次相随的各种良善，是主在人里面将良善，因而将聪明智慧建于其上的各个层面。然而，对那些不具有这些良善，也就是说，这些良善并非发自内心或情感之人来说，他们里面无法被植入天上的任何事物。因为他们里面没有接受的层面或土壤，因而没有接受的器皿。由于他们里面无法被植入天上的任何事物，故主也无法在那里。可以说，主是照着良善，也就是这良善的性质而临在的。而该良善的性质则取决于能植入信之真理的纯真、爱与仁的状态。</p>

I am a sojourner and a dweller with you. That this signifies their first state, that although the Lord was unknown to them still He could be with them, is evident from the representation of Abraham, 
as being the Lord (frequently shown above); and from the signification of being a "sojourner with them," and of being a "dweller with them," as being unknown and yet with them. That this is the internal 
sense is plain from what precedes and what follows; for here a new church is treated of, and in this verse its first state, which is such that first of all the Lord is unknown to them; and yet because 
they live in the good of charity, and in what is just and equitable as to civil life, and in what is honorable and becoming as to moral life, they are such that the Lord can be with them; for the 
Lord's presence with man is in good, and therefore in what is just and equitable, and further in what is honorable and becoming (what is honorable being the complex of all the moral virtues; and what 
is becoming being simply its form); for these are goods which succeed in order, and are the planes in man on which conscience is founded by the Lord, and consequently intelligence and wisdom. But with 
those who are not in these goods (that is to say from the heart or affection), nothing of heaven can be inseminated; for there is no plane or ground, thus there is no recipient; and as nothing of heaven 
can be inseminated, neither can the Lord be present there. The Lord's presence is predicated according to the good, that is, according to the quality of the good; the quality of the good is according 
to the state of innocence, of love, and of charity, in which the truths of faith have been implanted or can be implanted. </p>

'I am a stranger and an inhabitant among you' means their first state when, although the Lord was not known to them, He was nevertheless able to be with them. This is clear from the representation of 
'Abraham' as the Lord, often dealt with already, and from the meaning of 'being a stranger among them' and 'being an inhabitant among them' as not being known but nevertheless being with them. It is 
evident from what comes before and after that this is the internal sense, for the subject is a new Church, and in this verse the first state of that Church. This state is such that first of all they do 
not know the Lord, yet because they lead good and charitable lives, and in public life they are just and fair, and in private life honourable and correct, they are the kind of people with whom the Lord 
is able to be present. For the Lord is present with man in good, and so in justice and fairness, and further still in honourableness and correctness (honourableness being the sum total of all the 
private virtues, correctness simply the form that honourableness takes). These are the kinds of good that follow one another consecutively, and are the levels with man on which the Lord bases conscience, 
and consequently intelligence and wisdom. People however with whom these qualities do not exist, that is to say, with whom they do not proceed from the heart or affection, cannot have anything of 
heaven planted within them. There is no level, nor any ground, thus nothing to receive them. And as they cannot have anything of heaven planted within them, neither can the Lord be present there. The 
Lord may be said to be present according to the good that is present, that is, according to the nature of that good. And the nature of this good is determined by the state of innocence, love and charity 
in which the truths of faith have been, or are able to be, implanted. </p>

`Peregrinus et incola ego vobiscum':  quod significet statum illorum primum, quod tametsi Dominus illis ignotus, usque apud illos esse posset, constat a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, 
de qua saepius prius; et a significatione `esse peregrinus illis' et `esse incola illis' quod sit ignotus esse et usque apud illos esse; quod hic sensus internus sit, patet ab illis quae praecedunt et 
quae sequuntur; agitur enim de nova Ecclesia, et in hoc versu de primo ejus statu, qui talis est quod omnium primo illis ignotus sit Dominus, sed usque, quia in bono charitatis, et quoad vitam civilem 
in justo et aequo, et quoad moralem in honesto et decoro, vivunt, tales sunt ut apud illos Dominus esse possit; praesentia enim Domini apud hominem est in bono, et ideo in justo et aequo, et porro 
in honesto et decoro:  (honestum est complexus omnium virtutum moralium, decorum est modo forma illius:) nam haec sunt bona quae succedunt ordine, et sunt plana apud hominem, super quibus a Domino fundatur 
conscientia, et consequenter intelligentia et sapientia:  qui autem in illis non sunt, {1}nempe ex corde aut affectione, illis non inseminari potest aliquid caeli, nullum est planum, nec est humus, 
ita non recipiens; et quia non inseminari potest aliquid caeli, nec potest ibi Dominus praesens esse; praesentia Domini praedicatur secundum bonum, hoc est, secundum boni qualitatem, qualitas boni 
est secundum statum innocentiae, amoris et charitatis cui vera fidei implantata sunt seu implantari possunt. @1 hoc est$  </p>
