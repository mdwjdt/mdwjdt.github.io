<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6700.</strong>至于其它星球居民的神性敬拜，凡不拜偶像的人都承认主是独一神。诚然，除了极少数人外，他们没有谁知道主在我们星球披上人身，并将这人身变成神性。然而，他们所崇拜的神并不是一个完全不可知的神明，而是能通过一个人的形式而得以知道的。因为当神性向他们显现时，祂便以这种形式显现，就像祂以前也向我们地球上的亚伯拉罕和其他人显现一样。他们因崇拜一个人形式的神性，故崇拜主。他们还知道，<br />没有人能在信和爱上与祂联结，除非神性存在于一个他们能以某种概念来理解的形式中。如果祂不在这样一个形式中呈现自己，那么他们对祂的概念就会消散，就像视线投向外太空一样。当被我们地球灵告知，主曾在我们星球披上人身时，他们沉思了一会儿，很快说，这是为了拯救人类。他们还说，他们崇拜并为之献上至圣敬拜的神性在天堂显为太阳；祂在显现时，以可见的人形呈现自己。主在来世显为一轮太阳，天堂的所有光皆源于祂（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>e，<a href="5097.htm">5097</a>节）。不过，有关该主题的详情，我们将在后面的章节进行讲述。</p>

As regards the Divine worship of the inhabitants of other earths, all who are not idolaters acknowledge the Lord as the only God. They do not indeed know, except a very few, that the Lord assumed the 
Human in this earth and made it Divine; but they adore the Divine not as a Divine altogether incomprehensible, but as comprehensible through the human form; for when the Divine appears to them it appears 
in this form, as it also formerly appeared to Abraham and others on this earth; and because they adore the Divine under a human form, they adore the Lord. They also know that no one can be conjoined 
with the Divine in faith and love unless the Divine is in a form which they comprehend with some idea; if not in a form the idea would be dissipated, like sight in the universe. When told by the spirits 
of our earth that the Lord took upon Himself the Human in this earth, they mused a while, and presently said that this was done for the sake of the salvation of the human race; and that they adore 
with most holy worship the Divine which shines as the sun in heaven, and when it appears, presents itself to view in the human form. That the Lord appears as a sun in the other life. And that thence 
comes all the light of heaven, see n. 1053, 1521, 1529, 1530, 1531, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4321, 5097; but on this subject more will be specifically related hereafter. </p>

As regards the worship of God which the inhabitants of other worlds offer Him, all there who are not idolaters acknowledge the Lord as the one and only God. None but a very few, it is true, know that 
the Lord assumed the Human on our planet and made that Human Divine. Yet they adore God not as a Deity who is altogether unknowable but as One who can be known through a human form. For when the Divine 
shows Himself to them He does so within that form, as He also did in former times to Abraham and to others on our planet. And since they adore the Divine under a human form they adore the Lord. They 
also know that no one can be joined to the Divine in faith and love unless He is present in a form that people can have some conception of. If He did not present Himself in such a form their conception 
of Him would be lost, like sight looking at outer space. When they have been told by spirits from our planet that the Lord assumed the Human on our planet, they have pondered on it a little and soon 
said that this happened for the sake of the salvation of the human race. They have also said that the Divine whom they adore and offer the holiest worship to shines in heaven as the Sun and, when He 
appears, presents Himself in visible Human form. Regarding the Lord's appearance in the next life as the Sun and the fact that all the light of heaven is derived from Him, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a> (end), <a href="5097.htm">5097</a>. But more on these matters in particular is to be mentioned in later sections.  </p>

Quod cultum Divinum incolarum aliarum tellurum attinet, qui ibi non idololatrae sunt, omnes agnoscunt Dominum pro unico Deo; non quidem sciunt nisi paucissimi, quod Dominus Humanum in hac tellurum assumpserit 
et Illud Divinum fecerit; sed adorant Divinum non ut Divinum prorsus incomprehensibile, {1}(x)verum ut comprehensibile per humanam formam nam cum Divinum illis apparet, in illa formam; apparet, 
sicut etiam olim Abrahamo et aliis in hac tellure; et quia Divinum sub humana forma adorant, Dominum adorant; sciunt etiam quod nemo conjungi Divino fide et amore possit nisi Divinum in forma sit 
quam aliqua idea comprehendant; si non in forma, dissiparetur idea, sicut visus in universo.  Cum dictum illis a nostrae telluris spiritibus quod Dominus in hac tellure susceperit Humanum, pensitarunt 
aliquantum, et mox dixerunt quod propter salvationem generis humani hoc factum sit; et quod Divinum quod lucet ut Sol in caelo, et cum apparet, se in (t)forma Humana sistit videndum, sanctissimo cultu 
adorent; (m)quod Dominus ut Sol in altera vita appareat et quod inde omnis lux caeli, videatur n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4321 fin., 5097.(n)  Sed de his in sequentibus plura in specie 
memoranda sunt. 	@1 sed$ </p>
