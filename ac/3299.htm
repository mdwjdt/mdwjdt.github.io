<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3299.</strong>“看哪，腹中果然是双子”表这二者同时成孕。这从“双子”和“腹中”（in the womb）的含义清楚可知：“双子”是指这二者，也就是以扫所代表的良善和雅各所代表的真理；“腹中”（in the womb）是指怀孕（参看<a href="3293.htm">3293</a>节）。至于属世人的良善与真理这二者同时成孕，情况是这样：凡所出生的，都从父亲获得其存在，从母亲获得其显化。任何事物若要存在，这二者都是必需的。属世人的良善从为父亲的理性人的良善成孕，属世人的真理从为母亲的理性人的真理成孕（<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3288.htm">3288</a>节）。正是良善赋予生活，不过是通过真理赋予生命的。尽管这二者都被称为灵魂，但主要是良善为灵魂，真理则给它披上一种柔嫩的外壳或肉体，以使良善居于真理之中。这就是“腹中果然是双子”的意思。</p>

And behold twins were in her womb. That this signifies that both were conceived together, is evident from the signification of "twins," as being both, namely good, which is represented by Esau, and truth, 
which is represented by Jacob; and from the signification of "in the womb," as being conception (see above, n. 3293). As to both the good and the truth of the natural being conceived together, the 
case is this: Whatever is born derives its being from a father and its manifestation from a mother; it must have both in order to become something. The natural as to good is conceived from the good 
of the rational as a father, and as to truth is conceived from the truth of the rational as a mother (n. 3286, 3288). It is good which gives life, but through truth. Both these are called soul, but still 
good is principally the soul, while truth clothes it as with a kind of tender vessel or body, so that the good is in the truth. This is what is signified by "twins being in her womb." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3299</b></p><p><b>3299.</b>
'And behold, there were twins in her womb' means that the two were conceived simultaneously. This is clear from the meaning of 'twins' as the two, that is to say, good represented by 'Esau' and truth 
represented by Jacob', and from the meaning of 'in the womb' as conception, dealt with above in <a href="3293.htm">3293</a>. With regard to the two, that is to say, the good and the truth of the natural, being conceived simultaneously, 
the situation is that anything that is born owes its being (esse) to the father but its manifestation (existere) to the mother. Both are necessary if anything is to come into existence. 
As regards good the natural is conceived from the good of the rational as the father, and as regards truth from the truth of the rational as the mother, <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3288.htm">3288</a>. It is good that confers life, but it 
does so through truth. Though both are called the soul good is nevertheless primarily the soul, while truth clothes it in a kind of thin casing or body, so that the good resides within the truth. This 
is what is meant by 'twins in her womb'. </p>

</p><b>3299.</b>
`Et ecce gemini in utero ejus': quod significet utrumque simul conceptum, constat a significatione `geminorum' quod sint utrumque, nempe bonum quod repraesentatur per `Esavum' et verum quod repraesentatur 
per `Jacobum'; et a significatione `in utero' quod sit conceptio, de qua supra n. 3293. Quod utrumque, nempe bonum et verum naturalis, simul conceptum sit, ita se habet: quicquid nascitur, trahit 
suum esse a patre et suum existere a matre; utrumque erit ut fiat aliquid; naturale quoad bonum concipitur a rationalis bono ut a patre, et quoad verum, concipitur a rationalis vero ut a matre, n. 
3286, 3288; bonum est quod dat vitam sed per verum, utrumque hoc vocatur anima, sed usque bonum principaliter est anima, verum autem induit illud sicut specie tenelli vasis seu corporis, sic ut bonum 
sit in vero: haec sunt quae significantur per quod `gemini in utero ejus.' </p>
