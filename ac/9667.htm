<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9667节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9667.</strong>“板要用金子包裹，要用金子作板上的环，又要作房闩，闩也要用金子包裹”表良善的一个代表，一切事物都从良善并通过良善获得自己的存在。这从“用金包裹”和“用金子作”的含义清楚可知。“用金包裹”和“用金子作”是指良善的一个代表（参看<a href="9510.htm">9510</a>节）；“板”也表示提供支撑的良善（<a href="9634.htm">9634</a>节）；“环”表示良善和真理的结合（<a href="9493.htm">9493</a>，<a href="9495.htm">9495</a>节）；“闩”或“杠”表示源于良善的真理的能力（<a href="9496.htm">9496</a>节）。一切事物之所以都要从良善并通过良善获得自己的存在，是因为宇宙万物都与良善和真理有关，而真理来自良善，因而一切事物都从良善获得自己的存在。良善来源于神性本身。主的神性之爱构成神性良善，因为一切良善皆属于爱。神性之爱本身，因而神性良善就是那被称为耶和华，也就是主的存在本身，该存在的显现就是真理。由此可见，一切事物都从良善获得自己的存在。</p>

And thou shalt overlay the planks with gold, and make their rings of gold, houses for the bars; and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. That this signifies a representative of the good from which 
and through which are all things, is evident from the signification of "overlaying with gold," and of "making of gold," as being a representative of good (see n. 9510); by "the planks" also is signified 
the good which supports (n. 9634); by "the rings," the conjunction of good and truth (n. 9493, 9495); and by "the bars," the power of truth from good (n. 9496). The reason why all things are from good 
and through good, is that all things in the universe bear relation to good and truth, and good is that from which is truth, thus from which is everything. Good has its origin from the Divine Itself. 
The Lord's Divine love is the Divine good, for all good belongs to love. The Divine love itself, thus the Divine good, is the very being that is called "Jehovah," and also "the Lord;" the coming-forth 
therefrom is truth. From this it can be seen that all things are from good. </p>

'And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings from gold, houses for the bars; and you shall overlay the bars with gold' means a representative sign of the good from which and through 
which everything derives its existence. This is clear from the meaning of 'overlaying with gold' and 'making from gold' as a representative sign of good, dealt with in <a href="9510.htm">9510</a>, in addition to which good 
that lends support is meant by 'boards', <a href="9634.htm">9634</a>, good and truth joined together by 'rings', <a href="9493.htm">9493</a>, <a href="9495.htm">9495</a>, and the power of truth from good by 'bars' or 'poles', <a href="9496.htm">9496</a>. The reason why everything should 
derive its existence from and through the good is that everything throughout creation has connection with good and with truth, and good is that from which truth and so from which everything derives its 
existence. And good has its origin in the Divine Himself. The Lord's Divine Love constitutes Divine Good; for all good belongs to love. Divine Love itself and so Divine Good is Being itself (ipsum Esse), 
which is called Jehovah and also the Lord, and the Manifestation (Existere) of that Being is Truth. From all this it may be seen that everything derives its existence from good.  </p>

`Et asseres obduces auro, et annulos eorum facies auro, domos vectibus, et obduces vectes auro': quod significet repraesentativum boni ex quo et per quod omnia, constat ex significatione `obducere auro 
et facere (o)ex auro' quod sit repraesentativum boni, de qua n. 9510; per `asseres' etiam significatur bonum sustentans, n. 9634, per `annulos' conjunctio boni et veri, n. 9493, 9495, et per `vectes' 
potentia veri ex bono, n. 9496; quod aurum etiam repraesentaret quod omnia {1} ex bono et per bonum, est quia omnia quae in universo sunt se referunt ad bonum et ad verum, et bonum est ex quo verum, 
ita ex quo omne; bonum originem ducit ex ipso Divino; Divinus Amor Domini est Divinum Bonum, nam omne bonum est amoris {2}; ipse Divinus Amor ita Divinum Bonum est ipsum Esse quod vocatur Jehovah, 
et quoque Dominus, Existere inde est verum; inde constare potest quod ex bono {3} omnia. @1 After per bonum$ @2 omne enim quod est Divini amoris Domini dicitur bonum$ @3 et per bonum$ </p>
