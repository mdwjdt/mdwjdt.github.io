<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>165.</strong>对于“赤身露体不觉羞耻”表天真无邪，这从后面的故事更显而易见。因为当完整和天真失落以后，他们就为赤身感到羞耻，躲藏起来。<br />另外，在精灵界，当有灵希望辩白，表明自己无辜时，就以赤身露体来证明。<br />更明显的证据是，天堂的纯真者看似赤身的婴儿，且照各人的纯真之性戴着各式各样的花环。纯真之性稍次者则穿着光明得体的衣裳（可称为钻石丝绸），正如诸先知有时所见的那样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]165.</strong> The symbolism of their unembarrassed nakedness as innocence is highlighted by what followed, when their integrity and innocence deserted them. Then they blushed at their nakedness, which seemed like a disgrace to them, and that is why they hid.<br />Certain representative acts in the world of spirits also demonstrate that unembarrassed nudity symbolizes innocence. When spirits want to exonerate themselves and display their blamelessness, they show themselves naked, to testify to their innocence.<br />The strongest confirmation of this meaning is supplied by the innocent in heaven, who look like naked toddlers, wearing garlands that reflect their particular kind of innocence. Inhabitants with less innocence appear in beautiful, shimmery clothes — diamondlike silk, you might say — of a kind the prophets sometimes saw angels wearing.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This mention of angels in bright clothing seen by Old Testament prophets is probably a reference to the visions of otherworldly human beings wearing linen seen by Ezekiel (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_9_2" target=_top>Ezekiel 9:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_9_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_9_11" target=_top>11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_10_2" target=_top>10:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_10_6-7" target=_top>6-7</a>) and Daniel (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_daniel_10_5" target=_top>Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/bible_king-james-version_daniel_12_6-7" target=_top>12:6-7</a>); compare Revelation Explained (Swedenborg 1994-1997) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_951#subsection-2-4" target=_top>951:4</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 165</b></p><p><b>165.</b>
That the "nakedness of which they were not ashamed" signifies innocence, is proved by what follows, for when integrity and innocence departed they were ashamed of their nakedness, and it appeared to 
them disgraceful, and they therefore hid themselves. The same is evident also from the representations in the world of spirits, for when spirits wish to exculpate themselves and prove their guiltlessness, 
they present themselves naked in order to testify their innocence. Especially is it evident from the innocent in heaven, who appear as naked infants decorated with garlands according to the nature 
of their innocence; while those who have not so much innocence are clad in becoming and shining garments (of diamond silk as you might say), as the angels were occasionally seen by the prophets. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 165</b></p><p><b>165.</b>
The nakedness of which they were not ashamed means innocence. This is quite clear from what follows. When integrity and innocence left them they were then ashamed of their nakedness, and it seemed disgraceful 
to them, and so they hid themselves. It is additionally clear from the things represented in the world of spirits that the nakedness of which they were not ashamed means innocence. Indeed when 
spirits wish to exonerate themselves and prove that they are blameless they present themselves naked to witness their innocence. This is particularly clear with the innocent in heaven, who look like 
young children, naked, and wearing garlands round them that accord with their particular variety of innocence. But those who do not possess so much innocence appear clothed in splendid and shining clothes 
- you might call them brightest silk - like angels when seen from time to time by the prophets.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 165</b>
</p><b>165.</b>
Quod 'nuditas quam non erubescunt' significet innocentiam, constat manifeste a sequentibus quando integritas et innocentia recessit, quod tunc erubuerint nuditatem et ea apparuerit ut probrum, quare 
se occultabant. Ex iis quoque quae repraesentantur in mundo spirituum, etiam constat quod nuditas quam non erubescunt, significet innocentiam; spiritus enim dum se exculpare et praebere insontes volunt, 
se sistunt nudos, innocentiam testaturi. Imprimis ab iis qui innocentes sunt in caelo, qui apparent ut infantes nudi et secundum innocentiae speciem cincti serteis: at quibus non tantum innocentiae, 
ii apparent induti vestibus decoris et lucentibus, ita ut sericum adamantinum dicas, sicut angeli quandoque visi sunt prophetis. </p>
