<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3642节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3642.</strong>一天早晨，我与天使灵在一起，他们在思维和言谈上行如一体，如他们所习惯的那样。这种思维和言谈的一致性也朝地狱延伸，并且直达那里，以至于他们看似与地狱灵行如一体。但天使所具有的良善与真理在地狱灵当中却经历了惊人的转变，变成了邪恶与虚假。这种转变是随着良善与真理流下去而逐渐发生的，在那里，地狱藉着虚假说服和恶欲而行如一体。尽管地狱在大人之外，但它们仍以这种方式可以说成为一体，并由此被保持在秩序中，它们根据这秩序而彼此关联。主就这样通过祂的神性掌管地狱。</p>

One morning I was in company with angelic spirits, who according to custom acted in unity of thought and speech. This penetrated also toward hell, into which it was continued, insomuch that they appeared 
as it were to act as a one with the infernals; but the reason was that the good and truth with the angels was by a wonderful turning changed with the infernals into evil and falsity, and this by 
degrees as it flowed down, where hell acted as a one by persuasions of falsity and by cupidities of evil. Notwithstanding that the hells are out of the Grand Man, they are nevertheless in this manner 
reduced as it were into a one, and thereby are kept in order, according to which are their consociations; thus the Lord from His Divine directs the hells also. </p>

One morning I was in company with angelic spirits who in thought and speech were acting as one, as they were accustomed to do. This unity of thought and speech also extended towards, and reached into 
hell, insomuch that the angelic spirits appeared to be acting as one with those in hell. But good and truth as these existed with the angels underwent among those in hell an amazing conversion into evil 
and falsity, a conversion that took place by degrees as the good and truth flowed downwards, where hell was acting as one by means of false persuasions and evil desires. Although the hells are outside 
the Grand Man, nevertheless in this way they are made so to speak into a single entity and thereby are kept in order, according to which they are associated with one another. Thus the Lord from the 
Divine governs the hells also. </p>

</p><b>3642.</b>
Mane fui in consortio cum angelicis spiritibus, qui unum agebant cogitando et loquendo secundum morem; penetrabat hoc quoque versus infernum, in quod continuabatur, usque adeo ut apparerent sicut unum 
agere cum illis; sed erat quod bonum et verum quod apud angelos, per mirabilem versuram mutaretur in malum et falsum apud infernales, et hoc per gradus sicut defluebat, ubi infernum unum agebat per 
persuasiones falsi et cupiditates mali; inferna tametsi sunt extra Maximum Hominem, usque tamen tali modo quasi in unum rediguntur, et per hoc in ordine tenentur, secundum quem eorum consociationes {1}sunt; 
ita Dominus ex Divino etiam regit inferna. @1 fiunt$ </p>
