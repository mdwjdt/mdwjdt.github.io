<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9310.</strong>“因为我的名在他中间”表一切爱之良善和信之真理皆来自祂。这从“耶和华的名”和“他中间”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的名”是指用来敬拜神的整体上一切（参看<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>节），因而是指一切爱之良善和信之真理（<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>节）；“他中间”是指这一事实，它们存在于祂里面，因而也来自祂。爱之良善具有这样的性质，存在于它里面的东西也存在于来自它自己的其它东西里面；因为它分享它自己的东西，或说它拥有交流自己的能力。爱的本质特征就是愿意将自己的一切都献给他人。由于它从神性本身通过并出于祂的神性人身而如此行，所以主就其神性人身而言，也被称为“耶和华的名”（<a href="6887.htm">6887</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>节）。<br />人若不知道“名”在内义上表示什么，就会以为凡在圣言中出现“耶和华的名”和“主的名”的地方，它仅仅表示名字；而事实上，它还表示来自主的一切爱之良善和一切信之真理；如以下经文：<br />若是你们中间有两个人在地上，同心合意地求什么事，必为他们成全。因为无论在哪里，有两三个人奉我的名聚会，那里就有我在他们中间。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.19.htm">18:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.20.htm">20</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />凡为我的名撇下房屋，或是弟兄，姐妹，父亲，母亲，妻子，儿女，地产的，必要得着百倍，并且承受永生。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.29.htm">19:29</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信神独生子的名。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br /><br />但记这些事，要叫你们信耶稣是基督，是神的儿子，并且信了，使你们可以因祂的名得生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">20:31</a>）.<br />在这些，以及其它许多经文中，“主的名”表示用来敬拜祂的整体上一切爱之良善和信之真理。<br /><br />你们若住在我里面，我的话也住在你们里面；凡你们所愿意的，祈求就给你们成就。使你们奉我的名，无论向父求什么，祂就赐给你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.7.htm">15:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“奉我的名向父求”表示求主，如祂自己在同一福音书中所教导的：<br />你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成就。你们若奉我的名求什么，我必成就。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.13.htm">14:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“奉主的名求”表示求主，因为若不藉着主，没有人能到父那里去（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）；主的神性人身就是可见形式的耶和华或父，如前所示（<a href="9303.htm">9303</a>，<a href="9306.htm">9306</a>节）。<br />羊也听祂的声音，祂按着名叫自己的羊，把它们领出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.3.htm">10:3</a>）<br />“羊”表示那些处于仁与信的良善之人；“听祂的声音”表示服从祂的诫命；“按着名叫，把它们领出来”表示照着爱与信之良善而赐予天堂；因为“名”当论及人时，表示他们的爱与信的性质（<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）。</p>

Because My name is in the midst of him. That this signifies that from Him is all the good of love and truth of faith, is evident from the signification of the "name of Jehovah," as being all in one complex 
by which God is worshiped (see n. 2724, 3006), thus all the good of love and truth of faith (n. 6674); and from the signification of "in the midst of him," as being what is in Him, thus also what 
is from Him; for the good of love is of such a nature that what is in it, is also from it in others, because it has the power of communicating itself. For it is a characteristic of love that it wishes 
everything of its own to be out of itself in others; and as this is effected from the Divine Itself through and out of its Divine Human, therefore also the Lord as to the Divine Human is called "the 
name of Jehovah" (n. 6887, 8274).  [2] He who does not know what "name" signifies in the internal sense, may suppose that where the "name of Jehovah," and the "name of the Lord," are mentioned in 
the Word, the name alone is meant; when yet all the good of love and all the truth of faith which are from the Lord are meant thereby; as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     If two of you shall agree in 
My name on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them. Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (Matt. 18:19, 20)      Everyone 
that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life (Matt. 19:29).  
    As many as received Him, to them gave He power to be sons of God, even to them that believe in His name (John 1:12).      He that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed 
in the name of the only-begotten Son of God (John 3:18).      These things are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in His 
name (John 20:31). In these passages, and in very many others, by "the name of the Lord" is signified all the good of love and truth of faith in the complex by which He is worshiped.  [3] Again: </p>
<p> 
    If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He will give it you (John 15:7, 16); </p>
<p>"to 
ask of the Father in My name" denotes to ask the Lord, as He Himself teaches in the same Evangelist: </p>
<p>     Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do. If ye shall ask anything in My name, 
I will do it (John 14:13, 14); </p>
<p>"asking in the name of the Lord" denotes asking the Lord, because no one comes unto the Father except through the Lord (John 14:6); and because the Lord as to the Divine 
Human is Jehovah or the Father in a visible form (as was shown above, n. 9303, 9306). Again: </p>
<p>     The sheep hear His voice, and He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out (John 10:3); </p>
<p>"the 
sheep" denote those who are in the good of charity and of faith; "to hear His voice" denotes to obey His commandments; "to call by name, and lead them out" denotes to bestow heaven according to 
the good of love and of faith; for "the name, "when applied to persons, denotes their quality as to love and faith (n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 3421). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9310</b></p><p><b>9310.</b>
'For My name is in the middle of him' means that from Him comes all the good of love and truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'the name of Jehovah' as everything in its entirety by which 
God is worshipped, dealt with in <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, and so all the good of love and truth of faith, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>; and from the meaning of 'in the middle of him' as the fact that they exist within Him, and therefore 
also come from Him. The good of love is such that what exists within it exists also in others from itself; for it shares what is its own. The essential characteristic of love is to give its whole self 
up willingly to others. And since it does so from the Divine Himself through His Divine Human, and then from the Divine Human, therefore also the Lord is called, in respect of His Divine Human, 'the 
name of Jehovah', <a href="6887.htm">6887</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who does not know what 'name' means in the internal sense may think that wherever 'the name of Jehovah' or 'the name of the Lord' occurs in the Word it implies 
no more than His name, when in fact all the good of love and all the truth of faith which come from the Lord are meant, as in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
If two of you agree in My name<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> on earth about anything 
they ask, it will be done for them. Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:19, 20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who leaves houses or brothers 
or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields, for My name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will be allotted the inheritance of eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:29</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
As 
many as received [Him], to them He gave power to be sons of God, to those believing in His name. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who does not believe is judged already because he has not 
believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
These things have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing 
you may have life in His name. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:31</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In these and in very many other places 'the Lord's name' means all the good of love and truth of faith in their entirety by which He is worshipped. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, you will ask whatever you will, and it will be done for you. Whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give it to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:7,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:7, 16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Asking the Father in My name' means asking the Lord, as He Himself teaches in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Whatever you ask in My name, I will do it. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:13, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why 'asking in the Lord's name' means asking the Lord is that no one can come to the Father except through the Lord, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6</a>, and the Lord's Divine Human is Jehovah or 
the Father in visible form, as shown above in <a href="9303.htm">9303</a>, <a href="9306.htm">9306</a>. In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The sheep' stands for 
those who are governed by the good of charity and faith; 'hearing the voice' stands for obeying commandments; and 'calling by name and leading out' stands for conferring heaven in keeping with the 
good of charity and truth of faith, since 'name', in regard to people, means the nature of their love and faith, <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>.

`Quia nomen Meum in medio ejus': quod significet quod (c)ab ipso omne bonum amoris et verum fidei, constat ex significatione `nominis Jehovae' quod sit omne in uno complexu per quod colitur Deus, de 
qua n. 2724, 3006, ita omne bonum amoris et verum fidei, n. 6674, et ex significatione `in medio ejus' quod sit quod in ipso, ita quoque quod ex ipso, nam bonum amoris tale est ut quod est in illo etiam 
sit in aliis ex illo, est enim communicativum sui; proprium (o)enim amoris est ut velit quod omne suum ex se in aliis sit; hoc quia fit ex ipso Divino per Divinum Humanum Suum, et ex eo, ideo quoque 
Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum dicitur `nomen Jehovae,' n. 6887, 8274. 	[2] Qui non scit quid `nomen' {1} in sensu interno significat, credere potest quod in Verbo ubi `nomen Jehovae' ac `nomen Domini' 
dicitur, solum nomen intelligatur, cum tamen est omne bonum amoris et omne verum fidei quod a Domino, ut apud Matthaeum, 	Si duo ex vobis consenserint {2} super terra de omni re quamcumque petierint, 
fiet illis; ubi sunt duo aut tres congregati in nomine Meo, ibi sum in medio eorum, xviii 19, 20: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Omnis qui reliquerit domos, aut fratres, aut sorores, aut patrem, aut matrem, aut 
uxorem, aut liberos, aut agros, propter nomen Meum, centuplum accipiet, et vitae aeternae sortietur hereditatem, {3} xix 29: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Quotquot receperunt, dedit illis potestatem ut filii Dei 
essent, credentibus in nomen Ipsius, i 12: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Qui non credit, jam judicatus est quia non credidit in nomen (x)Unigeniti Filii Dei, iii 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Haec scripta sunt ut credatis quod 
Jesus sit Christus Filius Dei, et ut credentes vitam habeatis in nomine Ipsius, xx 31; </p>
<p>in his locis, et in perpluribus aliis, per `nomen Domini' significatur omne bonum amoris et verum fidei in complexu 
per quae colitur: [3] (s)apud Johannem, 	Si manseritis in Me, et verba Mea in vobis manserint, quicquid volueritis, petetis, etiam fiet vobis: quodcumque petieritis Patrem in nomine Meo, dabit 
vobis, xv 7, 16; </p>
<p>`petere Patrem in nomine Meo' est petere Dominum, sicut Ipse docet apud eundem Evangelistam, 	Quaecumque petieritis in nomine Meo, hoc faciam; si quid petieritis in nomine Meo, Ego 
faciam, xiv 13, 14; </p>
<p>quod `petere in nomine Domini' sit petere Dominum, est quia nemo venire ad Patrem potest nisi per Dominum, ibid. vers. 6, et quia Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum est Jehovah seu Pater 
in forma visibili, ut {4} supra n. 9303 (o)et 9306 ostensum est:(s) apud eundem, 	Oves vocem illius audiunt, et proprias oves vocat nomine tenus, et educit illas, x 3; </p>
<p>`oves' pro illis qui in bono 
charitatis et fidei sunt, `audire vocem' pro oboedire praeceptis, `vocare nomine tenus et educere' pro donare caelum secundum bonum amoris et verum fidei, nam `nomen' cum de hominibus, est quale eorum 
quoad amorem et fidem, n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 3421. @1 i in Verbo$ @2 i in Nomine Meo AIT Sch$ @3 i Matth.$ @4 i mox$ </p>
