<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8391节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8391.</strong>那些过着信仰生活的人每天都在悔改。他们会反省自己里面的邪恶，承认它们，提防它们，祈求主的帮助。因为人凭自己常常跌倒，却又常常被主扶起来。当他心里渴望邪恶的东西时，他就凭自己跌倒了；但当他抵制邪恶，并因此不去作恶时，他就被主扶起来了。这就是所有处于良善之人的状态；然而，那些陷入邪恶的人却常常跌倒，也常常被主扶起来；但主这样做只是为了防止他们掉进最悲惨的地狱，而是把他们带进一个更温和的地狱；因为如果任由他们自己，他们会竭尽全力地把自己带入最悲惨的地狱。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8391</b></p><p><b>8391.</b>
He who leads a life of faith does repentance daily; for he reflects upon the evils that are in him, acknowledges them, guards himself against them, and supplicates the Lord for aid. For from himself 
man is continually falling, but is continually being raised up by the Lord. He falls from himself when he thinks what is evil with desire; and he is raised up by the Lord when he resists evil, and consequently 
does not do it. Such is the state with all who are in good; but they who are in evil are continually falling, and also are continually being uplifted by the Lord; but this to prevent them from 
falling into the most grievous hell of all, whither from themselves they incline with all their might: thus in truth uplifting them into a milder hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8391</b></p><p><b>8391.</b>
Those who lead the life of faith repent daily. They pay attention to the evils present with them, acknowledge them, are on their guard against them, and implore the Lord for help. For by himself a person 
is constantly falling, but the Lord is constantly putting him on his feet again. By himself he falls whenever his mind desires something evil, but the Lord puts him on his feet again whenever he 
resists evil and therefore does not carry it out. This is the condition of all who are governed by good. Those however who are ruled by evil are constantly falling, and they are also being raised constantly 
by the Lord. But He does this so that they will fall not into the most oppressive hell of all, to which if left to themselves all their efforts take them, only into a milder one. </p>

</p><b>8391.</b>
Qui vitam fidei agit, is quotidie paenitentiam agit, nam reflectit super mala quae apud se, agnoscit illa, cavet sibi ab illis, {1}supplicat Dominum de ope; homo enim (x)continue ex se labitur, sed 
a Domino continue erigitur; ex se labitur cum cogitat velle malum, et a Domino erigitur cum resistit malo, et inde non facit illud; talis status est omnibus qui in bono sunt; qui autem in malo sunt labuntur 
continue, et quoque a Domino elevantur continue, sed ne cadant in infernum omnium gravissimum, quo ex se omni nisu tendunt, (m)verum in mitius.(n) 	@1 After ope$ </p>
