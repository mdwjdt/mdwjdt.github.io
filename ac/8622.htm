<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8622节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8622.</strong>“我要将对亚玛力的记忆从天下完全抹掉”表这虚假必须被完全移开，以便它可能不再进行争战。这从“抹掉记忆”的含义和“亚玛力”的代表清楚可知：“抹掉记忆”是指移开，如下文所述；“亚玛力”是指那些沉浸于内层邪恶所生的虚假之人（参看<a href="8593.htm">8593</a>节）<br />“将对亚玛力的记忆抹掉”之所以表示移开内层邪恶所生的虚假，是因为这虚假能被移开，但不能被抹掉，因为它是与活到永远的地狱恶魔同在的虚假（<a href="8593.htm">8593</a>节）。然而，这些恶魔被主移开，以防止他们流入那些属于属灵教会的人。原因是，他们不像地狱灵那样流入属于理解力的思维，因而不流入属于信的观念，而是流入属于意愿的情感，从而流入属于仁爱的感觉。他们做这一切时如此隐秘，以至于来自他们的东西从未显出一丝痕迹。因此，如果他们真的流入一个属灵教会成员，那么他绝无可能得救，因为他们会败坏并完全扭曲他对真理和良善的情感。这就是为何这些地狱恶魔被移开，好叫他们与那些属于主的属灵国度之人没有任何接触。<br />要进一步知道，属灵教会成员有一个被植入其心智的理解力部分的新意愿（<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>，<a href="4328.htm">4328</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节）。如果这些恶魔被允许流入，那么这个意愿就会被他们完全毁灭。他们还会进入旧意愿的遗传之爱，重新打开它们，尽管它们已经被关闭了。关于它们的关闭，可参看前文（<a href="986.htm">986</a>，<a href="1667.htm">1667</a>，<a href="2308.htm">2308</a>节）。为防止他们流入，这些地狱恶魔以这种方式被移开。因为他们的虚假，就是由内层邪恶所产生的虚假，就是邪恶，而且具有这一性质的邪恶：它不能流入心智的理解力部分，只能流入意愿部分。正因如此，还因属灵教会成员的新意愿被植入理解力部分，如前所述，所以他们被移开，防止流入它。此外，为达到这个目的，主还规定，这类恶魔的整个理解力被荒废。<br />那些在心里不断伤害他们的邻舍，以这类事愉悦他们的思维，还暗中通过其他人造成伤害，并且尽管最大努力防止任何人知道是他们发起这一切的人死后就会变成这类恶魔。在其它方面，他们外表上似乎谦逊有礼，在言谈，以及生活上就像朋友，也像基督徒，然而其实是伪君子，内心里是诡诈的老虎。</p>

That blotting I will blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens. That this signifies that this falsity must be completely removed so that it may fight no longer, is evident from the signification 
of "blotting out the memory," as being to remove (of which below); and from the representation of Amalek, as being those who are in falsity from interior evil (see n. 8593). [2] That "blotting 
out the memory of Amalek" denotes to remove the falsity which is from interior evil, is because this can be removed, but cannot be blotted out, for this falsity exists with the infernal genii who live 
to eternity (n. 8593). But these genii are removed by the Lord, to prevent them from flowing into those who are of the spiritual church. The reason is that they do not flow into the thoughts which are 
of the understanding, thus not into what is of faith, as infernal spirits do, but into the affections which are of the will, consequently into the things of charity; and this so secretly that there 
never appears a trace that it is from them; and therefore if they were to flow in, the man of the spiritual church could not possibly be saved, because they would pervert and utterly deprave the affections 
of truth and good. Hence it is that these infernal genii are removed, so that they may not communicate with those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom. [3] Be it known further that with the 
man of the spiritual church a new will has been implanted in the intellectual part (n. 895, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113), which will these genii would wholly destroy if they were permitted 
to flow in. They would also enter into the hereditary evils of the old will, and would reopen them, and yet they have been closed (that these have been closed, see n. 986, 1667, 2308). These infernal 
genii are removed in this way in order to prevent their flowing in; because their falsity, which is falsity from interior evil, is evil, and indeed such evil that it cannot flow into the intellectual 
part, but into the will part; and as the new will of the man of the spiritual church has been implanted in the intellectual part, as was said above, they have consequently been removed from influx 
into it. To this end moreover the Lord provides that such genii be vastated as to everything intellectual. [4] Men become such genii after death who have continually meditated evil against their 
neighbor, and have delighted their thought with such things, and moreover have inflicted evil, but secretly and by means of others, taking the greatest care that no one should know that it came from 
them. In other respects they have seemed in outward appearance modest and courteous, and like friends, and also like Christians in their speech, as also in their life, yet have been hypocrites, and inwardly 
deceitful tigers. </p>

'That I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven' means that that falsity is to be completely removed, so that it may no longer engage in conflict. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'blotting out the memory' as removing, dealt with below; and from the representation of 'Amalek' as those who are steeped in falsity arising from interior evil, dealt with in <a href="8593.htm">8593</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason 
why 'blotting out the memory of Amalek' means removing the falsity that arises from interior evil is that it can be removed, but cannot be blotted out, since it is the falsity residing with hellish 
genii who live forever, <a href="8593.htm">8593</a>. These genii are however removed by the Lord so that they do not flow into those who belong to the spiritual Church, the reason for this being that they do not flow, as hellish 
spirits do, into thoughts belonging to the understanding, nor thus into ideas belonging to faith, but into affections belonging to the will, consequently into feelings belonging to charity. And 
they do this so secretively that not a trace of what comes from them is ever apparent. If therefore they were to flow into a member of the spiritual Church he could not possibly be saved, because they 
would pervert and utterly warp his affections for what is true and good. This is why those hellish genii are removed so that they do not have any contact with those who belong to the Lord's spiritual 
kingdom.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Furthermore it should be recognized that a member of the spiritual Church has a new will implanted in the understanding part of his mind, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a>, <a href="4328.htm">4328</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>. This will would be completely destroyed by those genii if they were allowed to flow in. They would also enter into and open up again the hereditary evils of the old will, even though they have 
been closed off. Regarding the closing off of them, see <a href="986.htm">986</a>, <a href="1667.htm">1667</a>, <a href="2308.htm">2308</a>. Those hellish genii are removed in this way to prevent them from flowing in. Their falsity, which is falsity arising from interior 
evil, is evil - evil whose nature is such that it cannot flow into the understanding part of the mind, only into the will part. This being so, and because the new will of a member of the spiritual 
Church has been planted in the understanding part, as stated above, they have consequently been removed from flowing into it. To this end the Lord also controls things in such a way that the entire 
power of understanding in these genii is laid waste. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 After death people become genii like these if they have had doing harm to their neighbour constantly in mind, allowing such ideas to delight 
their thinking, and have also inflicted harm, but secretively and through others, taking the utmost care to prevent anyone from knowing that they had initiated it. In other respects they were to outward 
appearances unassuming, polite, and seemingly friendly; they were also seemingly Christian in speech, and in life too. They were however hypocrites, and inwardly were treacherous tigers. </p>

`Quod delendo delebo memoriam Amaleki de sub caelis': quod significet quod falsum illud prorsus removendum sit ut non pugnet amplius, constat ex significatione `delere memoriam' quod sit removere, de 
qua sequitur, et ex repraesentatione `Amaleki' quod sint qui in falso ex malo interiore, de qua n. 8593. 	2 Quod `delere memoriam Amaleki' sit removere falsum quod ex malo interiore, est quia id removeri 
potest, non {1} deleri, {2}est enim id falsum apud genios infernales, qui in aeternum vivunt, n. 8593; sed genii illi removentur a Domino ne influant in illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; causa 
est quia non influunt sicut (t)spiritus infernales in cogitationes quae {3} intellectus, ita nec in illa quae fidei (d)sunt, sed in {4}affectiones quae voluntatis {3}, proinde in illa quae charitatis; 
et hoc tam clandestine ut nusquam appareat vestigium quod ab illis; quare si illi influerent, spiritualis Ecclesiae homo nusquam salvari posset, quoniam affectiones veri et boni perverterent et prorsus 
depravarent {5}; inde est quod infernales illi genii removeantur ita ut non communicent cum illis qui e regno spirituali Domini. 	3 Praeterea sciendum quod apud hominem Ecclesiae spiritualis nova 
voluntas implantata sit in parte {6} intellectuali, (m)n. 895, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113;(n) hanc voluntatem plane destruerent genii illi {7}si iis permitteretur influere; intrarent 
etiam in hereditaria mala voluntatis veteris, et illa recluderent, quae tamen occlusa sunt; quod occlusa sint, videatur n. 986, 1667, 2308.  Infernales illi genii removentur {8}hoc modo ne influant; 
quod falsum (c)eorum, quod est falsum ex interiore malo, sit malum, et quidem tale malum quod non influere potest in partem intellectualem {9} sed in partem {6} voluntariam; et quia nova voluntas {10}hominis 
Ecclesiae spiritualis implantata est in parte intellectuali, ut supra dictum, inde remoti sunt ab influxu in illam; ob {11}hunc finem etiam Dominus disponit ut tales genii vastentur quoad omne 
intellectuale. 	4 Homines fiunt tales genii {12}post mortem, qui continue meditati sunt malum contra proximum, et cogitationem suam talibus delectaverunt; et quoque intulerunt malum, sed clandestine 
ac per alios, maxime cavendo ne aliquis sciret quod ab illis; ceteroquin in externis apparuerunt modesti, civiles, et sicut amici, et quoque sicut Christiani quoad {13}loquelam, tum etiam quoad vitam, 
sed fuerunt hypocritae, ac intus dolosi tigres. 	@1 i autem$ 	@2 genii enim qui in illo falso in aeternum vivunt$ 	@3 i sunt$ 	@4 illa$ 	@5 i mille modis$ 	@6 i ejus$ 	@7 si ab illis influere
