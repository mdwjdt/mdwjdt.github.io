<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6057节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6057.</strong>在说一说流注和灵魂进入身体的运作之前，必须清楚明白这一真理：内在人照着天堂的形像被造，外在人则照着世界的形像被造，以至于内在人就是天堂所能取的最小形式，或最小形式的天堂，外在人则是世界所能取的最小形式，因而是一个小世界。外在人是世界的一个形像，这一事实从外在或身体感官可以看出来。耳朵是照着适合空气改变的整体性质而被造或形成的；肺是照着适合空气压力的整体性质而被造或形成的。通过周围空气压力被保持在自己形状中的身体整个表面也是如此。眼睛是照着适合以太和光的整体性质而被造或形成的；舌头是照着适合对溶解并悬浮在液体中的粒子的感知而被造或形成的，同时与肺、气管、喉、声门、下颌、嘴唇一起照着适合利用空气以不同的方式发出清晰的声音或话语，以及乐声的能力而被造或形成。鼻孔是照着适合对大气中的悬浮粒子的感知而被造或形成的；遍及整个身体的触觉，是照着适合对空气状况的变化，也就是说，它是冷是热的感知，以及对液体性质和物体重量的感知而被造或形成的。身体周围的空气所无法进入的内脏被一种名为以太的更纯粹的大气保持在关联和形状中。更不用说自然界所深藏的一切秘密被刻写并应用于身体或外在人了，如力学、物理学、化学和光学的一切秘密。由此明显可知，整个自然界都有助于构造人的外在；正因如此，古人称人为小世界。<br />正如外在人照着世界事物的形像被造或形成，内在人则照着天堂事物的形像，也就是照着从主发出、天堂由此形成并在其中的属天和属灵事物的形像被造或形成。那里的属天事物就是对主之爱和对邻之仁的所有方面；那里的属灵事物则是信的所有方面。它们本身如此之多，并且具有这样的性质：舌头连它们的百万分之一都说不出来。内在人照着所有这些事物的形像被造或形成，这一事实在天使身上是显而易见的。当他们在一个人的内视，如我的内视面前显现时，仅仅他们的同在就能激起他内心深入的情感。因为对主之爱和对邻之仁从他们身上涌出，并渗透到旁观者那里；爱与仁所散发的东西，即信的光芒从他们身上发出，并激发人的情感。这一点，以及其它证据有助于说明，内在人因被造或形成是要成为一位天使，故是天堂所能取的最小形式，或说一个最小形式的天堂。<br />由此清楚可知，在人里面，灵界与自然界相联结。因此，对人类来说，灵界以如此至关重要的方式流入自然界，以至于只要他注意一下，就能发觉这一点。这一切也表明灵魂与身体相互作用的性质，即：严格来说，它是天堂的属灵实物与世界的属世事物的交流；这种交流通过流注并照着二者的联结实现。通过并照着二者的联结而实现的这种交流如今不为人知，因为每一个事物都被归于自然界，并没有关于属灵之物的任何知识，如今这种知识如此遥远，以至于当人们思想它时，它似乎不存在。</p>

Before any statement can be made about influx and the operation of the soul into the body, it must be well understood that the internal man is formed according to the image of heaven, and the external 
man according to the image of the world; insomuch that the internal man is a heaven in the least form, and the external man is a world in the least form, thus is a microcosm. That the external man is 
an image of the world, may be seen from the external or bodily senses; for the ear is formed according to the whole nature of the modification of the air; the lungs according to the whole nature of 
its pressure, as also is the general surface of the body, which is held in its form by the circumpressure of the air; the eye is formed according to the whole nature of ether and of light; the tongue 
to the sense of the solvent and fluent parts in liquids; and, together with the lungs, the trachea, the larynx, the glottis, the fauces, and the lips, according to the power of suitably modifying the 
air, whence come articulate sounds, or words, and harmonious sounds; the nostrils are formed according to the sense of particles fluent in the atmosphere; the sense of touch, which encompasses the whole 
body, is according to the sense of the changes of state in the air, namely, to the sense of its cold and heat, and also to the sense of liquids and to that of weights. The interior viscera to which 
the aerial atmosphere cannot enter are held in connection and form by a more subtle air, which is called ether; not to mention that all the secrets of interior nature are inscribed upon and applied to 
the external man, such as all the secret things of mechanics, of physics, of chemistry, and of optics. From all this it is evident that universal nature has contributed to the conformation of the external 
of man; and hence it is that the ancients called man a microcosm. [2] And just as the external man has been formed according to the image of all things of the world, so has the internal man been 
formed according to the image of all things of heaven, that is, according to the image of the celestial and spiritual things which proceed from the Lord and from which and in which is heaven. The celestial 
things there are all those which are of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor; and the spiritual things there are all those of faith, which in themselves are so many and of such 
a nature that the tongue cannot possibly utter one millionth part of them. That the internal man has been formed according to the image of all these things, is strikingly shown in the angels, who when 
they appear before the internal sight (as they have appeared before mine), affect the inmosts by their mere presence; for love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor pour out of them and penetrate, 
and the derivative things of faith shine forth from them and affect. By this and other proofs it has been made plain to me that as the internal man has been created to be an angel, he is a heaven 
in the least form. [3] From all this it is now evident that in man the spiritual world is conjoined with the natural world, consequently that with him the spiritual world flows into the natural world 
in so vivid a manner that he can notice it, provided he pays attention. All this shows the nature of the interaction of the soul with the body, namely, that properly it is the communication of spiritual 
things which are of heaven, with natural things which are of the world, and that the communication is effected by means of influx, and is according to the conjunction. This communication which is 
effected by means of influx according to the conjunction is at this day unknown, for the reason that each and all things are attributed to nature, and nothing is known about what is spiritual, which 
at this day is so far set aside that when it is thought of it appears as nothing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6057</b></p><p><b>6057.</b>
Before anything can be said about the influx and operation of the soul into the body, a proper knowledge is required of the truth that the internal man has been created so as to conform to an image of 
heaven, and the external man to an image of the world, so much so that the internal man is the smallest form heaven can take, and the external man is the smallest the world can take and is thus the 
microcosm. The fact that the external man is an image of the world can be seen from his external or physical senses. The ear has been made to conform to the whole nature of the modification of air, and 
the lungs to the whole nature of air-pressure. So too with the surface-areas of the body, which are held in shape by the pressure of air all around them. The eye has been made to conform to the whole 
nature of the ether and light; the tongue to the perception of particles dissolved and suspended in fluids, and at the same time along with the lungs, trachea, larynx, glottis, jaws, and lips to conform 
to the power of using air in varying ways to produce articulated sounds or words, and musical sounds too. The nostrils have been made to conform to the perception of particles suspended in the atmosphere, 
and touch, a sense which is distributed over the whole of the body, to the perception of changes in the condition of the air, that is to say, whether it is cold or hot, as well as the perception 
of the nature of fluids and the weights of objects. (The internal organs, which the air surrounding the body cannot enter, are held together and kept in shape by a purer kind of air, called ether.) 
This is not to mention all the deeply hidden aspects of the natural world that have been inscribed on and apply themselves to the body, such as all the secrets of mechanics, physics, chemistry, and 
optics. All this goes to prove that the entire natural order was drawn on so that the external side of the human being might be created in conformity with it, which was why the ancients named the human 
being the microcosm.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Now just as the external man has been created so as to conform to an image of everything in the world, so the internal man has been created so as to conform to an image 
of everything in heaven, that is, an image of the celestial and spiritual qualities that come from the Lord, from which heaven is formed and in which it consists. The celestial qualities there are all 
the aspects of love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and the spiritual qualities are all the aspects of faith. They are intrinsically so great and of such a nature that no tongue can possibly 
declare even a millionth of them. The truth that the internal man has been made so as to conform to an image of all those qualities is plain to see in the angels. When they appear before a person's 
internal sight, as they have appeared before mine, their presence alone stirs feelings to the depths of his being. For love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour pour out of them and into 
the onlooker; and what is radiated by that love and charity, namely rays of faith, shines out of them and stirs one's affections. This has served to show, as well as other proofs, that because the internal 
man has been created to be an angel, the internal man is the smallest form heaven can take.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it now becomes clear that within the human being the spiritual world has been 
joined to the natural world. As a result, in the case of the human being, the spiritual world flows into the natural world in so vital a way that a person can discern it if he merely stops to pay attention 
to it. This also shows what the interaction of the soul with the body is, that strictly speaking it is a communication of the spiritual realities of heaven with the natural things of the world, 
a communication which is effected by one flowing into the other, yet depends on the way the two have been joined together. This communication effected through an inflowing which depends on the way the 
two have been joined together is unknown at the present day, for the reason that every single thing is attributed to natural forces and there is no knowledge of what is spiritual, which at the present 
day is so remote that when people give it any thought it seems to be non-existent. </p>

Antequam tradi potest aliquid de influxu et de operatione animae in corpus, probe sciendum quod internus homo sit ad imaginem caeli, et externus ad imaginem mundi, formatus; usque adeo ut internus homo 
sit caelum in minima forma, et externus sit mundus in minima forma, ita microcosmus.  Quod externus homo sit imago mundi, constare potest ex sensibus (t)externis seu corporis; auris enim formata est 
ad omnem naturam modificationis aeris; {1}pulmones ad omnem naturam pressionis ejus; sicut etiam ambitus corporis qui ex circumpressione aeris in sua forma continetur; oculus est ad omnem naturam aetheris 
et lucis efformatus; lingua ad {2} sensum partium solutarum et fluentium in liquidis; et simul cum pulmone, trachea, larynge, glottide, faucibus et labiis, ad potentiam convenienter modificandi 
aerem, unde {3}soni articulati, seu voces, et soni harmonici; nares sunt formatae ad sensum partium fluentium in atmosphaera; tactus qui {4}circum universum corpus est, ad sensum mutationum status in 
aere, nempe ad sensum ejus frigoris et caloris, ut et ad sensum liquidorum et ad sensum gravium; viscera interiora ad quae atmosphaera aerea non intrare potest, continentur in connexu et {5} forma a 
subtiliore aere qui aether vocatur; ut taceam quod omnia arcana interioris naturae ei inscripta et applicata sint, sicut omnia arcana mechanices, omnia physices, omnia chymices, omnia optices; ex {6}his 
constare potest quod universa natura ad conformandum externum hominis conducta sit; inde est quod antiqui hominem nuncupaverint microcosmum.  Sicut nunc externus homo formatus est ad imaginem omnium 
mundi, ita est internus homo formatus ad imaginem omnium caeli, hoc est, ad imaginem caelestium et spiritualium quae procedunt a Domino, (c)a quibus et in quibus est caelum; caelestia ibi sunt omnia 
quae amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum, et spiritualia ibi sunt omnia fidei; quae in se tanta sunt et talia ut lingua nusquam effari queat eorum unam myriadis myriadum partem; quod internus 
homo ad imaginem omnium illorum formatus sit, conspicue exhibetur in angelis, qui cum apparent coram visu interno, sicut apparuerunt coram meo, afficiunt intima ex sola praesentia, nam amor in Dominum 
et charitas erga proximum exundant ex illis et penetrant, et quae inde sunt, nempe quae fidei, elucent ex illis et afficiunt; inde patuit, et ex aliis auctoramentis, quod internus homo, quia creatus 
est ut sit angelus, sit caelum in minima forma.  [3]Ex his nunc constare potest quod in homine conjunctus sit mundus spiritualis cum mundo naturali, consequenter quod apud illum influat mundus spiritualis 
in mundum naturalem ita ad vivum ut appercipiat si modo attendit; inde etiam patet quid commercium animae cum corpore, nempe quod proprie sit communicatio spiritualium quae caeli, cum naturalibus 
quae mundi, et quod {7}communicatio fiat per influxum, et se habeat secundum conjunctionem.  Communicatio haec, quae fit per influxum secundum conjunctionem, hodie ignota est ob causam quia omnia 
et singula tribuuntur naturae, et nihil scitur de spirituali, quod hodie est tam remotum ut cum cogitatur de eo, appareat {8}ut nullum. @1 pulmo$ @2 i omnem$ @3 vox articulata$ @4 per universum corporis
