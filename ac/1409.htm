<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1409节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1409.</strong>所描述的历史事件具有代表性，每一个词都具有属灵之义。这从前面有关代表物和具有属灵之义的事物的阐述和说明（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="1361.htm">1361</a>节）清楚可知。由于代表从此处开始，故最好简单解释一下这个问题。属天的上古教会将一切尘世和世俗之物，因而将肉体之物（无论它们是何种方式的感官物体）都视为死物。但因为这个世界上的每一个事物都体现了主的国度、因而体现了属天和属灵之物的某种观念，所以他们每当看见这些物体，或以某种感官能力意识到它们，就会思想属天、属灵之物，而不是思想它们。事实上，他们不是通过这些世俗物体思考，而是借助它们思考。对他们而言，死物就这样活了。<br />那些具有属灵之义的事物通过这些人的口由他们的后代搜集起来，这些后代又将它们转变为教义，也就是洪水后古教会的圣言。在古教会，这些教义是具有属灵之义的事物，因为他们通过教义认识内在事物，并思想属灵、属天之物。但后来，这种知识开始逐渐消失，以致他们不再知道所表示的是这类事物，并开始视地上和世俗之物为神圣，敬拜它们，根本不考虑它们的含义，就在这时候，同样的事物就成了代表。始于亚伯兰，后来在雅各的后代中建立的代表性教会由此兴起。由此可知，代表起源于古教会中具有属灵之义的事物，而这些事物则起源于上古教会的属天观念。<br />代表的性质从圣言的历史部分清楚可知，其中那些祖先的一切行为，也就是说，亚伯兰、以撒、雅各、后来的摩西，以及审判官、犹大和以色列诸王的行为无非是代表。如前所述，在圣言中，“亚伯兰”代表主，并由于代表主，故也代表属天之人；“以撒”也代表主，并由此代表属灵之人；而“雅各”同样代表主，并由此代表对应于属灵者的属世之人。<br />但代表具有这样的性质：人们完全不用考虑代表人的品性，只关注他所代表的事物即可。犹大和以色列的诸王，不管他们是哪种人，都代表主的王权，所有祭司，不管他们是哪种人，都代表主的祭司职务。因此，坏人和好人一样能代表主和主国度的属天、属灵之物；因为如前面所阐述和说明的，代表和履行代表的这个人完全分离。正因如此，圣言的所有历史都具有代表性；由于它们具有代表性，故可知，它们在内义上所表示的事物完全不同于它们在字义上所表示的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1409.</strong> The idea that the historical facts are representative but the words are each symbolic can be seen from previous remarks and illustrations in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1409/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665" target=_top>665</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1409/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_920" target=_top>920</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1409/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361" target=_top>1361</a> concerning representation and symbolism. Since the representative narrative begins here, let me give a further, brief explanation.<br />The people of the earliest church, which had a heavenly character, regarded every earthly, worldly, or bodily thing that ever presented itself to their senses as a dead object only. But each and every item in the world presents some image of the Lord's kingdom and so of heavenly and spiritual attributes. As a result, when they observed those objects, or encountered them by some other sense, their thoughts centered not on the objects but on aspects of heaven and of the spirit and came not from the objects but through them. So for them, dead objects were alive.<br />[2] The symbolic meanings of these items were received from their lips by the next generation, which gathered such meanings together and made doctrinal precepts out of them. Collectively, these formed the Word of the ancient church, after the Flood. Such precepts taught the people of the ancient church in a symbolic way, because they were both a means by which those people learned inward lessons, and the source of their thoughts about heavenly and spiritual matters.<br />This knowledge started to die out, however, so that people had no idea what such objects symbolized, and they began to make them sacred 钬?though they were worldly and temporal things 钬?and to worship them, without any thought of their symbolism. Then those same objects became representative. Such was the origin of the representative church, which commenced with Abram and was later established among Jacob's descendants.<br />From all this you can see that representation rose out of the symbolism of the ancient church and that the symbolism of the ancient church rose out of the heavenly ideas of the earliest church.<br />[3] The nature of representation can be seen from the Word's histories. There, all the deeds of these patriarchs 钬?Abram, Isaac, and Jacob 钬?and later of Moses, the Judges, and the monarchs of Judah and Israel, are nothing if not representative.<br />In the Word, as noted [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1409/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402" target=_top>1402</a>], Abram represents the Lord, and because he represents the Lord, he also represents the heavenly self; Isaac too represents the Lord, and therefore the spiritual self; and Jacob as well represents the Lord, and therefore an earthly self corresponding to the spiritual self.<br />[4] The situation with regard to representation, though, is that it implies nothing about the character of the person but only about the phenomenon that the person represents. All the monarchs of Judah and Israel represented the Lord's sovereignty, no matter what they were like, and all the priests represented the Lord's priesthood, no matter what they in turn were like. So bad ones and good ones alike were able to represent the Lord and the heavenly and spiritual qualities of his realm. As stated and proved already [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1409/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665" target=_top>665</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1409/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361" target=_top>1361</a>], the representative meaning is completely separate from the person.<br />This, then, is why all the historical sections of the Word are representative. Since they are representative, it follows that all the words there are symbolic. That is, they mean something different in an inner sense than in the literal sense. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1409</b></p><p><b>1409.</b>
That the historicals are representative, but all the words significative, is evident from what has already been said and shown concerning representatives and significatives (n. 665, 920, 1361); nevertheless, 
since representatives begin here, it is well to give briefly a further explanation of the subject. The Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, looked upon all earthly and worldly, and also 
bodily things, which were in any wise objects of the senses, as being dead things; but as each and all things in the world present some idea of the Lord's kingdom, consequently of things celestial and 
spiritual, when they saw them or apprehended them by any sense, they thought not of them, but of the celestial and spiritual things; indeed they thought not from the worldly things, but by means of them; 
and thus with them things that were dead became living.  [2] The things thus signified were collected from their lips by their posterity and were formed by them into doctrinals, which were the Word 
of the Ancient Church, after the flood. With the Ancient Church these were significative; for through them they learned internal things, and from them they thought of spiritual and celestial things. 
But when this knowledge began to perish, so that they did not know that such things were signified, and began to regard the terrestrial and worldly things as holy, and to worship them, with no thought 
of their signification, the same things were then made representative. Thus arose the Representative Church, which had its beginning in Abram and was afterwards instituted with the posterity of Jacob. 
From this it may be known that representatives had their rise from the significatives of the Ancient Church, and these from the celestial ideas of the Most Ancient Church. [3] The nature of representatives 
may be manifest from the historicals of the Word, in which all the acts of the fathers, Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, and afterwards those of Moses, and of the judges and kings of Judah and Israel, 
were nothing but representatives. Abram in the Word, as has been said, represents the Lord; and because he represents the Lord, he represents also the celestial man; Isaac likewise represents the 
Lord, and thence the spiritual man; Jacob in like manner represents the Lord, and thence the natural man corresponding to the spiritual.  [4] But with representatives the character of the person is 
not considered at all, but the thing which he represents; for all the kings of Judah and of Israel, of whatever character, represented the Lord's kingly function; and all the priests, of whatever character, 
represented His priestly function. Thus the evil as well as the good could represent the Lord and the celestial and spiritual things of His kingdom; for, as has been said and shown above, the representatives 
were altogether separated from the person. Hence then it is that all the historicals of the Word are representative; and because they are representative, it follows that all the words of 
the Word are significative, that is, that they have a different signification in the internal sense from that which they bear in the sense of the letter.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1409</b></p><p><b>1409.</b>
That the historical events as described are representative, but every word carries a spiritual meaning, becomes clear from what has been stated and shown already about representatives and about things 
that carry a spiritual meaning in <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="1361.htm">1361</a>. Since representatives begin at this point, let a further brief explanation be given. The Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, regarded all earthly 
and worldly things, and also bodily things, which were in any way the objects of their senses, as nothing else than things that were dead. But because every single thing in the world presents some 
idea of the Lord's kingdom and therefore of celestial and spiritual things, they did not think about those objects whenever they saw them or became aware of them with some sensory power, but about celestial 
and spiritual things. And indeed they did not think from those worldly objects but by means of them. In this way things with them that were dead became living. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those things that carried 
a spiritual meaning were gathered from the lips of those people by their descendants, and these turned them into doctrinal teachings which constituted the Word of the Ancient Church after the Flood. 
These doctrinal teachings in the Ancient Church were things that carried a spiritual meaning, for through them they came to know internal things, and from them thought about spiritual and celestial things. 
But after this knowledge began to perish, so that they ceased to know that such things were meant and they started to regard those earthly and worldly things as holy and to worship them without 
any thought as to their spiritual meaning, those same things at that point became representative. From this arose the representative Church which began in Abram and was subsequently established among 
the descendants of Jacob. From this it may be known that representatives had their origin in the things in the Ancient Church which carried a spiritual meaning, and that these had their origin in the 
heavenly ideas present in the Most Ancient Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The nature of representatives becomes clear from the historical parts of the Word, where all the acts of those forefathers, that is to say, the 
acts of Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, and later on of Moses, the judges, and the kings of Judah and Israel, are nothing other than representatives. As has been stated, 'Abram' in the Word represents the 
Lord, and because he represents the Lord, he also represents the celestial man. 'Isaac' too represents the Lord, and from that the spiritual man, while 'Jacob' likewise represents the Lord, and from that 
the natural man corresponding to the spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But the nature of representatives is such that no attention at all is paid to the character of the representative person, only to the thing which 
he represents For all the kings of Judah and Israel, no matter what kind of men they were, represented the Lord's Royalty, and all the priests, no matter what kind of men these were, His Priesthood. 
Thus bad men as well as good were able to represent the Lord, and the celestial and spiritual things of His kingdom, for, as stated and shown already, representatives were entirely separate from the 
person involved. So then all the historical narratives of the Word are representative, and as this is so it follows that all the words of the Word carry a spiritual meaning, that is, they mean something 
different in the internal sense from what they do in the sense of the letter. </p>

Quod historica sint repraesentativa sed omnia verba sint significativa, constare potest ex illis quae de repraesentativis et significativis prius dicta et ostensa sunt n. 665, 920, 1361; hic quia repraesentativa 
incohant, breviter adhuc rem licet exponere: Antiquissima Ecclesia quae fuit caelestis, omnia terrestria et mundana, tum corporea, quae usquam objecta fuerunt eorum sensuum, non aliter spectabant 
ac res mortuas; sed quia omnia et singula quae in mundo sunt, sistunt aliquam ideam regni Domini, proinde rerum caelestium et spiritualium, cum illa viderent aut caperent aliquo sensu, non cogitabant 
de iis sed de caelestibus et spiritualibus, et quidem non ab illis sed per illa; ita res mortuae apud eos vivebant.  Haec quae significabant, ab ore illorum collegerunt posteri, et inde fecerunt 
doctrinalia quae fuerunt Verbum Ecclesiae Antiquae post diluvium; haec apud Ecclesiam Antiquam fuerunt significativa, nam per illa didicerunt interna et ex illis cogitarunt de spiritualibus et caelestibus. 
 At postquam perire coepit cognitio illa, ut nescirent quod talia significarentur, atque inciperent terrestria illa et mundana sancta facere et colere, absque cogitatione de significatione eorum, 
tunc eadem facta sunt repraesentativa; inde Ecclesia repraesentativa quae incohat in Abramo, et postea instituta apud Jacobi posteros: inde sciri potest quod ortus repraesentativorum sit a significativis 
Ecclesiae Antiquae, et significativa Ecclesiae Antiquae a caelestibus ideis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae.  Repraesentativa quomodo se habent, constare potest ab historicis Verbi ubi omnia acta patrum 
horum, nempe Abrami, Isaci et Jacobi, tum postea Mosis, judicum, regum Jehudae et Israelis, nihil aliud sunt quam repraesentativa: 'Abramus,' ut dictum, in Verbo repraesentat Dominum, et quia Dominum, 
etiam caelestem hominem, 'Isacus' quoque Dominum et inde spiritualem hominem, 'Jacobus' similiter Dominum et inde naturalem hominem correspondentem spirituali: sed ita se habet cum repraesentativis 
quod nihil reflectatur super personam qualis est, sed super rem quam repraesentat; omnes enim reges Jehudae et Israelis repraesentabant Regium Domini, qualescumque essent, et omnes sacerdotes Sacerdotale 
Domini, qualescumque essent; ita potuerunt tam mali quam boni repraesentare Dominum, et Ipsius regni caelestia et spiritualia; nam, ut dictum et ostensum prius, repraesentativa prorsus separata 
sunt a persona.  Inde nunc est quod omnia historica Verbi sint repraesentativa et quia illa sunt repraesentativa, sequitur quod omnia verba Verbi sint significativa, hoc est, quod aliud significent 
in sensu interno quam in sensu litterae. </p>
