Verses 22-26. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field in the land 
of Egypt. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and Jehovah gave voices and hail, and the fire walked unto the land, and Jehovah made it rain hail upon the land of Egypt. And there was hail, 
and fire walking at the same time in the midst of the hail, very grievous, such as had not been like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote in all the land of Egypt 
all that was in the field, from man and even to beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was 
there no hail. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies a command; "Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven," signifies attention, and the approach of heaven; "and there shall be hail in all the land of 
Egypt," signifies destroying falsity in the natural mind; "upon man, and upon beast," signifies interior and exterior good; "and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt," signifies every truth 
of the church in the natural mind; "and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven," signifies communication with heaven; "and Jehovah gave voices," signifies the withdrawal and separation of the 
communication with those who are in good and truth; "and hail," signifies falsities destroying these goods and truths; "and the fire walked unto the land," signifies the evils of cupidities; "and Jehovah 
made it rain hail upon the land of Egypt," signifies the natural mind taken possession of by the falsities of evil; "and there was hail, and fire walking at the same time in the midst of the hail, 
very grievous," signifies the persuasions of falsity together with the cupidities of evil; "such as has not been like it in all the land of Egypt," signifies that no others had such a state of the natural 
mind; "since it became a nation," signifies from the day in which it was made capable of admitting good and the derivative truth; "and the hail smote in all the land of Egypt," signifies that this 
falsity destroyed the things that were in the natural mind; "all that was in the field," signifies whatever was of the church; "from man and even to beast," signifies its interior and exterior good; 
"and the hail smote every herb of the field," signifies that these falsities destroyed every truth of the church; "and broke every tree of the field," signifies that they also destroyed all the knowledges 
of truth and good of the church; "only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was there no hail," signifies that it was not so where those were who were of the spiritual church. </p>

Verses 22-26 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand towards heaven, and there will be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast, and on every plant of the field in the land of Egypt. 
And Moses stretched out his rod towards heaven, and Jehovah gave forth voices<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and hail, and fire ran down to the earth; and Jehovah caused hail to rain onto the land of Egypt. And there was hail, 
and at the same time fire running down<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> in the midst of the hail, extremely heavy, of which there had not been the like in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail struck in all the 
land of Egypt everything that was in the field, from man and even to beast; and the hail struck every plant of the field, and broke every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children 
of Israel were, there was no hail.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means a command. 'Stretch out your hand towards heaven' means attention drawn to heaven, which would then come nearer. 'And there 
will be hail in all the land of Egypt' means destructive falsity in the natural mind. 'On man and on beast' means interior and exterior good. 'And on every plant of the field in the land of Egypt' 
means every truth of the Church in the natural mind. 'And Moses stretched out his rod towards heaven' means communication with heaven. 'And Jehovah gave forth voices' means the departure and severance 
of communication with those governed by good and guided by truth. 'And hail' means those destructive falsities. 'And fire ran down to the earth' means evil desires. 'And He caused hail to rain onto 
the land of Egypt' means the natural mind, which falsities arising from evil took possession of. 'And there was hail, and at the same time fire running down in the midst of the hail, extremely heavy' 
means firm beliefs in what is false together with desires for evil. 'Of which there had not been the like in all the land of Egypt' means that such a state of the natural mind did not exist in any others. 
'Since it became a nation' means from the day on which it happened that it was able to admit goodness and therefore truth into itself. 'And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt' means that that 
falsity destroyed the things which were in the natural mind. 'Everything that was in the field' means whatever was an attribute of the Church. 'From man and even to beast' means its good, interior 
and exterior. 'And the hail struck every plant of the field' means that those falsities destroyed all of the Church's truth. 'And broke every tree of the field' means that they also destroyed all the 
Church's cognitions of truth and good. 'Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail' means that they did not destroy anything where those who belonged to the spiritual 
Church were.

Vers. 22-26.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam versus caelum, et erit grando in omni terra Aegypti super hominem et super bestiam, et super omnem herbam agri in terra Aegypti.  Et extendit 
Moscheh baculum suum ad caelum, et Jehovah dedit voces et grandinem, et ambulavit ignis ad terram, et pluere fecit Jehovah grandinem super terram Aegypti.  Et fuit grando, et ignis simul ambulans 
in medio grandinis, gravis valde, quae non fuerat sicut illa in omni terra Aegypti, a quo fuit in gentem.  Et (x)percussit grando in omni terra Aegypti omne quod in agro, ab homine et usque ad bestiam, 
et omnem herbam agri percussit grando, et omnem arborem agri confregit.  Tantum in terra Goschen, ubi filii Israelis, non fuit grando.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat mandatum: `Extende 
manum tuam versus caelum' significat advertentiam et appropinquationem caeli: `et erit grando in omni terra Aegypti' significat falsum destruens in mente naturali: `super hominem et super bestiam' significat 
bonum interius et exterius: et super omnem herbam agri in terra Aegypti' significat omne verum Ecclesiae in mente naturali: `et extendit Moscheh baculum suum ad caelum' significat communicationem 
cum caelo: `et Jehovah dedit voces' significat recessionem et separationem communicationis cum illis qui in bono et vero: `et grandinem' significat falsa destruentia illa: `et ambulavit ignis ad terram' 
significat mala cupiditatum: `et pluere fecit grandinem super terram Aegypti' significat sic mentem naturalem a falsis mali occupatam: `et fuit grando, et ignis simul ambulans in medio grandinis, 
gravis valde' significat falsi persuasiones una cum {1}mali cupiditatibus: `quae non fuerat sicut illa in omni terra Aegypti' significat quod talis status mentis naturalis non aliis: `a quo fuit in 
gentem' significat a die quo facta sit ut admittere' bonum et inde verum posset: `et percussit grando in omni terra Aegypti' significat quod falsum illud destruxerit illa quae in mente naturali: `omne 
quod in agro' significat quicquid Ecclesiae esset: `ab homine et usque ad bestiam' significat bonum ejus interius et exterius: `et omnem herbam agri percussit grando' significat quod omne verum Ecclesiae 
destruxerint falsa illa: `et omnem arborem agri confregit' significat quod etiam omnes cognitiones veri et boni Ecclesiae: `tantum in terra Goschen, ubi filii Israelis, non fuit grando' significat 
quod non ubi illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali. 	@1 malis cupiditatum$ </p>
