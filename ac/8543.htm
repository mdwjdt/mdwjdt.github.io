<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8543节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8543.</strong>他们不知道，他们的独一主曾在我们地球生而为人。他们说，知道这一切不是他们所关心的，他们只想知道祂是一个人，统治整个宇宙。当我说，在我们地球，祂叫耶稣基督，“基督”表示受膏者或王，“耶稣”表示救世主时，他们说，他们不将祂作为王来敬拜，因为王权带有世俗的味道，而是把祂作为救世主来敬拜。由于我们地球灵注入一种怀疑，即：他们的独一主与我们的主是不是同一位，所以他们通过回想他们曾看见祂在太阳中，并认识到祂就是他们曾在他们星球所看见的那一位（参看<a href="7173.htm">7173</a>节）而驱散了这种怀疑。关于我们的主是天堂的太阳，可参看前文（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>e，<a href="5097.htm">5097</a>，<a href="7078.htm">7078</a>，<a href="7083.htm">7083</a>，<a href="7171.htm">7171</a>，<a href="7173.htm">7173</a>节）。</p>

They do not know that their One Only Lord was born a man on this earth. They said that it is of no concern to them to know this, but only to know that He is a Man, and directs the universe. Then I said 
that on our earth He is named Jesus Christ, and that "Christ" means the Anointed or King, and "Jesus" Savior, they said that they do not worship Him as a King, because royalty savors of what is worldly, 
but that they worship Him as the Savior. And because a doubt was injected by the spirits of our earth, whether their One Only Lord is the same as our Lord, they removed the doubt by recalling that 
they had seen Him in the Sun, and that they recognized that it was He whom they had seen on their earth. (On this subject see n. 7173; and that our Lord is the Sun of heaven, n. 1053, 3636, 3643, 4060, 
4321, 5097, 7078, 7083, 7171, 7173.) </p>

They do not know that their one and only Lord was born a person on our planet. They said they were not interested to know this, only that He is a Person and rules over all. When I said that on our planet 
He is called Christ Jesus, and that Christ means anointed or king and Jesus means Saviour, they said that they do not worship Him as a king because kingship smacks of what is worldly; but they do 
worship Him as their Saviour. And because the doubt was introduced by spirits from our planet as to whether their one and only Lord was the same Lord as ours, they removed that doubt by recollecting 
that they had seen Him in the Sun and recognized Him as the One whom they had seen on their planet regarding which see <a href="7173.htm">7173</a>. As regards our Lord's being the Sun of heaven, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a> (end), <a href="5097.htm">5097</a>, <a href="7078.htm">7078</a>, <a href="7083.htm">7083</a>, <a href="7171.htm">7171</a>, <a href="7173.htm">7173</a>. </p>

Non sciunt quod unicus illorum Dominus natus sit homo in hac tellure; dicebant quod id scire non illis curae sit, modo quod Ipse Homo sit, et regat universum.  {1}Cum dicebam quod in nostra tellure 
{2}Ille nominetur Christus {3} Jesus, et quod Christus significet unctum seu regem, et Jesus Salvatorem, dicebant quod Ipsum non colant ut regem, quia regium sapit ex mundano, sed quod colant Ipsum ut 
Salvatorem; et quia (c)e nostrae telluris spiritibus injiciebatur dubium num unicus illorum Dominus esset idem cum nostro Domino, {4}removebant illud per id quod recordati sint quod viderint Ipsum in
