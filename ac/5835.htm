<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5835.</strong>“我父亲的灵魂与这童子的灵魂相连”表当有更紧密的联结时。这从“灵魂”的含义清楚可知，“灵魂”是指生命，因而“这一个的灵魂与另一个的灵魂相连”表示这一个的生命与另一个的生命紧密相连。因此，所表示的是有更紧密的联结，也就是说属灵良善，即“以色列”与源于这良善的真理，即“便雅悯”的更紧密的联结。至于良善及其真理联结如此紧密，如同这一个的灵魂与另一个的灵魂紧密相连，情况是这样：人的心智，即真实的人自己和人的生命所在之处，有两种官能，一种是给信之真理配的，另一种是给仁之良善配的。给信之真理配的官能被称为理解力，给仁之良善配的官能被称为意愿。为叫人能成为人，这两种官能必须构成一体。<br />但如今，这两种官能完全分开了，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：人能理解某事是真的，却不能意愿它。因为人能在他的理解力中看到，十诫是真理，取自圣言的教义在某种程度上也是真理；事实上，他还能利用自己的理解力去确认它们，甚至去传讲它们。然而，其意愿却与这些真理相悖，他的行为因此也是这样。由此明显可知，人里面的这两种官能是分开的。然而，它们是不可分开的，这一点从以下事实可知：当他进入来世时，如果它们分开，那么理解真理会把他提升到天堂，而意愿邪恶则会把他拽下地狱，从而使他悬在这二者之间。即便如此，构成他实际生命的意愿会把他拽下来，从而不可避免地把他带入地狱。因此，为防止这种事发生，这两种官能必须联结在一起。这种联结通过重生由主实现，即通过信之真理植入仁之良善实现。因为如此人就通过信之真理被赋予一个新的理解力，通过仁之良善被赋予一个新的意愿；这赋予他构成一个完整心智的两种官能。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5835</b></p><p><b>5835.</b>
And his soul is bound in his soul. That this signifies since there is close conjunction, is evident from the signification of "soul," as being life, thus "the soul of the one being bound in the soul 
of the other" signifies the life of the one in the life of the other, consequently that there is close conjunction-here of spiritual good, which is "Israel," with the truth from this good, which is "Benjamin." 
As to there being so close a conjunction between good and its truth, like the soul of the one which is bound in the soul of the other, the case is this. The mind of man, which is the man himself, 
and is where the man's life is, has two faculties, one allotted to the truths of faith, the other to the good of charity. The faculty which is allotted to the truths of faith is called the understanding, 
and that which is allotted to the good of charity is called the will. In order that man may be man, these two faculties must make a one. [2] But that at the present day these two faculties 
are altogether disjoined, may be seen from the fact that a man can understand that a thing is true, and yet not will it. He can understand that all things in the Decalogue are true, also in some measure 
those in the doctrinals which are from the Word; nay, he may also be able intellectually to confirm them, and even to preach them, but yet will otherwise, and from willing act otherwise. It is plain 
from this that these two faculties in man are disjoined. But that they ought not to be disjoined may be known from the fact that to understand truth would elevate a man toward heaven, and to will evil 
would draw him down toward hell, and so he would hang between the two. But still his will, in which his very life consists, would draw him downward, thus inevitably into hell. Therefore lest this happen, 
these two faculties must be conjoined, which is done through regeneration by the Lord, and this through the implantation of the truth of faith in the good of charity. For thus through the truth 
of faith the man is endowed with a new understanding, and through the good of charity with a new will; whence he has two faculties which make one mind. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5835</b></p><p><b>5835.</b>
'And his soul being bound up with his soul' means when more closely joined together. This is clear from the meaning of 'soul' as life, so that 'the soul of the one bound up with the soul of the other' 
means the life of the one in that of the other. Consequently a closer joining together is meant, that is to say, of spiritual good, which is 'Israel', to the truth springing from that good, which is 
'Benjamin'. The implications of good being joined as closely to truth as the soul of the one is bound up with that of the other are as follows: A person's mind, which is the real person and is where 
his life resides, has two powers, one of which is assigned to the truths of faith, the other to the good of charity. The mental power assigned to the truths of faith is called the understanding, while 
the one assigned to the good of charity is called the will. To enable a person to be truly human these two powers must make a unified whole. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But at the present day those two mental powers have 
become completely set apart from each other, as may be recognized from the fact that a person can understand something as being true and yet be unable to will it. For a person can see in his understanding 
that all the Ten Commandments are truths and to some extent that the contents of religious teachings drawn from the Word are truths; indeed he can also confirm that they are truths by the use of 
his understanding and in addition through the preaching he hears. yet the intentions of his will are at variance with those truths, and so as a consequence are his actions. From this it is evident that 
those two mental powers present in a person have become set apart from each other. Yet they ought not to be set apart, as may be recognized from the consideration that should they be set apart when 
he enters the next life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the truth in his understanding will raise him up towards heaven, while the evil intentions in his will will draw him down towards hell, thus leaving him suspended between the 
two. Even so, the intentions in his will, which constitute his actual life, will carry him downwards, thus taking him inevitably into hell. Therefore to prevent this from happening, those two mental 
powers have to be joined together. This is effected by the Lord through regeneration - through the implantation of the truth of faith within the good of charity. For in this way a person is provided through 
the truth of faith with a new understanding, and through the good of charity with a new will; and this gives him two mental Powers which make one complete mind.

`Et anima ejus vincta in anima ejus': quod significet cum arcta conjunctio, constat ex significatione `animae' quod sit   vita, ita `anima unius vincta in anima alterius' quod sit unius vita in alterius, 
consequenter quod sit arcta conjunctio, nempe boni spiritualis quod est `Israel', et veri ex illo bono quod est `Benjamin'. Cum hoc quod tam arcta conjunctio sit inter bonum et ejus verum, sicut 
anima unius quae vincta est in anima alterius, ita se habet: mens hominis, quae est ipse homo et ubi est vita hominis, habet binas facultates, unam {1}quae dicata veris quae fidei, et (x)alteram {1}quae 
dicata bono quod charitatis; facultas quae dicata est veris quae fidei, vocatur intellectus, et quae dicata {2} bono quod charitatis, vocatur voluntas; ut homo sit homo, binae hae facultates unum 
facient; [2] sed quod facultates illae binae hodie prorsus sejunctae sint, {3}constare potest ex eo, quod homo intelligere {4}possit quod verum sit, et quod usque non {5}possit velle illud; potest enim 
intelligere quod vera sint omnia quae in decalogo, etiam quodammodo quae in doctrinalibus quae ex Verbo, immo etiam potest intellectualiter confirmare illa, et quoque per praedicationem, at usque vult 
aliud et ex velle facit aliud; inde patet quod binae illae facultates apud hominem sejunctae sint; sed quod non sejunctae esse debeant, {6}sciri potest ex eo quod {7} intelligere verum elevaret illum 
versus caelum, at velle malum detraheret illum versus infernum, et sic penderet inter utrumque; {8}at usque ejus velle, in quo ipsissima ejus vita consistit, auferret illum deorsum, ita inevitabiliter 
in infernum; ne itaque id fiat, binae illae facultates conjungendae sunt, quod fit per regenerationem a Domino, et hoc per implantationem veri quod fidei in bono quod charitatis; sic enim per verum 
quod fidei, homo donatur novo intellectu, et per bonum quod charitatis, donatur nova voluntate; inde binae facultates quae faciunt unam mentem. @1 dicatam$ @2 i est$ @3 notum est, homo enim$ @4
