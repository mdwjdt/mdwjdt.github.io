<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6438.</strong>从以色列所预言关于约瑟的这些话又一次看出，每个细节都包含一个内义；没有内义，几乎所有这些话都无法理解。只关注字义的人可能以为关于约瑟所说的这些话会通过玛拿西和以法莲发生在他的后代身上，因为以色列说，他要把他们末后之日必遇的事告诉他们（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.1.htm">49:1</a>）。但在摩西五经、约书亚记、士师记、撒母耳记、列王纪所记载关于他们的历史中根本没有任何这种事发生在他们身上。他们所蒙的福并不比其它任何支派大；相反，和其它支派一样，他们被掳去，并被分散在列邦中。由此明显可知，真正的含义并非字义所讲述的内容，而是包含在内义中的某种其它事物。此外，没有内义，人不可能知道关于约瑟所说的这些话是什么意思，即：“约瑟是多结果子的人，是泉旁多结果之子，女儿啊，她爬到墙上；弓箭手苦害他，向他射箭，仇恨他。约瑟要坐在他弓的力量里，他的手臂因大能的雅各之手而强壮；以色列的牧者、石头是从那里而出的”，以及“他父亲的祝福，胜过他祖先的祝福，如永世山岭的渴慕。它们必降在约瑟的头上，临到他众弟兄当中拿细耳人的头顶上”。其中的每一句话都具有这样的性质：若不通过内义，没有人能知道这句话的真实意思是什么。</p>

From all that Israel foretold about Joseph, it is also evident that in each detail there is an internal sense, and that without this sense scarcely anything is understood. He who looks only at the sense 
of the letter may believe that these things that were said about Joseph would happen to his descendants through Manasseh and Ephraim (Gen. 48:1). But in their history in the books of Moses, Joshua, 
Judges, Samuel, and Kings, nothing of the kind is found; for they were not blessed above the rest of the tribes, and they like the rest were led into captivity and dispersed among the Gentiles; from 
which it is evident that what is stated in the sense of the letter is not signified, but something else that is in the internal sense. Also that without the internal sense it is impossible to know what 
all these things about Joseph involve-as that Joseph is "the son of a fruitful one, a fruitful one over a fountain, of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall; the archers embitter him, and shoot at 
him, and hate him; and he shall sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands are made strong by the hands of the mighty Jacob, from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel;" that "the 
blessings of his father shall prevail above the blessings of his progenitors, even to the desire of the hills of an age;" and that "they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head 
of the Nazirite of his brethren;" all and each of which things are such that no one can know what they mean except from the internal sense. </p>

From these things foretold by Israel regarding Joseph it may again be seen that every detail contains an inner meaning and that without that meaning scarcely anything is intelligible. The person who 
fixes his attention solely on the literal meaning may think that these things which were stated regarding Joseph were going to happen to his descendants from Manasseh and Ephraim, because in verse 1 Israel 
says that he was going to tell them what would happen to them at the end of days. But in the historical accounts concerning those descendants in the Books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, or Kings, 
one does not find anything of the sort happening to them. They were no more greatly blessed than any other tribe; rather, like all the others they were taken away into captivity and scattered among 
the nations. From all this it is evident that the real meaning is not what presents itself in the sense of the letter but something else contained in the internal sense. Furthermore without the internal 
sense one cannot begin to know what all the things said about Joseph imply, namely these:  </p>
<p>The son of a fertile one is Joseph, of a fertile one beside a spring; daughters, each one of whom marches 
onto the wall. </p>
<p>They exasperate him and shoot at him and hate him, do the archers. </p>
<p>He will sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands will be made strong by the hands of the 
powerful Jacob; from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel. </p>
<p>The blessings of his father will prevail over the blessings of his ancestors, even as far as the desire of the everlasting hills. </p>
<p>They 
will be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of the Nazirite among his brothers. </p>
<p>Every single one of these statements is of such a nature that no one can ever know what it really 
means except from the internal sense. </p>

Ex his quae Israel de Josepho {1}praedixit, etiam constare potest quod in singulis internus sensus sit et quod absque illo sensu  vix aliquid (x)intelligatur; qui sensum litterae modo spectat {2}credat 
quod haec quae de Josepho dicta sunt, posteris ejus ex Menashe et Ephraimo contingerent, {3} vers. 1; sed ex historicis de illis in Libris Mosis, Joshuae, Judicum, Samuelis et (x)Regum, non aliquid 
tale invenitur; non enim illis benedictio fuit prae reliquis; et quoque illi, sicut reliqui, in captivitatem abducti sunt ac dispersi inter gentes; ex quibus patet quod non id significetur quod in sensu 
litterae exstat sed quod aliud quod in sensu interno.  {4}Tum quoque absque sensu interno neutiquam sciri potest quid omnia illa de Josepho involvunt, sicut quod `filius fecundae Joseph, fecundae 
supra fontem, filiae quae incedit supra murum', quod `exacerbent eum, jaculentur, odio habeant sagittarii', quod `sedebit in valido arcus sui, et roborabuntur  brachia manuum ejus a manibus potentis 
Jacobi, exinde Pastor, Lapis Israelis'; quod `benedictiones patris ejus praevalebunt super benedictionibus genitorum {5}suorum usque ad desiderium collium saeculi', et quod illa `erunt capiti Josephi, 
et vertici naziraei fratrum ejus'; haec omnia et singula talia sunt ut nusquam aliquis scire queat quid sunt nisi ex sensu inferno. @1 prophetavit$ @2 credet$ @3 i quia dicit Israel, quod diceret 
illis quid in postremitate dierum illis contingeret$ @4 quod absque illo sensu$ @5 ejus$ </p>
