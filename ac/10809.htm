<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10809节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10809</strong>.后来，他们问我主如何在来自我们地球的天使当中显现。我说，祂在太阳里面作为一个人显现，在那里被太阳的火光围绕，这火光就是天上的天使所拥有的一切光的源头。它发出的热是神性良善，发出的光是神性真理；这二者都来自神性之爱，也就是所看到围绕那太阳里面的主的火之表象。但我补充说，这太阳只向天上的天使显现，不向下面的灵人显现，因为比起天上的天使，这些灵人距离对爱之良善和信之真理的接受更遥远。关于世界的太阳，它不向来世的任何人显现，尽管它在他们的脑海中呈现为一个黑色、不可见的物体，在与天上的太阳，就是主相反的方向上。他们之所以被允许向我提问关于主和祂在来自我们地球的天使面前显现的问题，是因为这时，主乐意使自己在他们当中同在，将如他们所抱怨的，那里的恶灵所倾覆的事物恢复秩序。为了让我看见这些事物也是我被带到那里的原因。</p>

They then asked how the Lord appears with the angels from our earth. I said that He appears in the Sun as a Man, encompassed there with solar fire, from which the angels in the heavens have all their 
light; and that the heat which proceeds from it is Divine good, and that the light which is from it is Divine truth, both from the Divine love, which is the fiery appearance round the Lord in that Sun; 
but that that Sun is seen only by the angels in heaven, and not by the spirits who are beneath, because these are more remote from the reception of the good of love and the truth of faith than are 
the angels who are in the heavens. But as regards the sun of the world, it is seen by no one in the other life, yet it appears in their idea as something that is black and not visible, from its being 
opposite to the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord. The reason why it was given them to inquire about the Lord and about His appearance before the angels from our earth, was that it then pleased the Lord 
to present Himself as present with them, and to reduce into order the things that had been disturbed by the evil ones there about which they had complained. It was in order that I might see these things 
that I had been brought there. </p>

After this they asked me in what way the Lord appears among angels from our planet. I said that He appears in the Sun as a Human Being, surrounded there by its fiery glow, the source of all the light 
that angels in heaven possess. The heat which radiates from there, I said, is Divine Good and the light which does so is Divine Truth, both coming from the Divine Love, which constitutes the fiery glow 
appearing around the Lord within that Sun. But that Sun, I added, appears only to angels in heaven, not to spirits below, since they are too far away to receive the good of love and truth of faith 
as angels in the heavens do. As for the worldly sun however, it does not appear to any in the next life, though it presents itself in their minds as a black, invisible object in the opposite direction 
from the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord. The reason why they had been allowed to question me about the Lord and His appearance before angels from our planet was that the Lord was then pleased to make 
Himself present among them and to restore to order things which, as they complained, the evil [spirits] there had overturned. To the end that I might see these things was also the reason why I had 
been taken to that part of the planet.  </p>

{1}Deinde interrogabant quomodo Dominus apparet apud angelos e nostra tellure; dicebam quod appareat in Sole ut Homo, {2} circumdatus ibi {3} igneo solari, ex quo omnis lux est angelis in caelis, et 
quod calor qui procedit inde, sit Divinum Bonum, et quod lux quae inde sit Divinum Verum, utrumque ex Divino Amore, qui est igneum apparens circum Dominum in illo Sole; (m)sed quod (t)Sol ille modo angelis 
in caelo appareat et non spiritibus qui infra sunt, quoniam hi remotiores sunt a receptione boni amoris et veri fidei quam angeli qui in {4}caelis.  Quod autem solem mundi attinet, is nulli in 
altera vita apparet, sistitur tamen in idea illorum sicut nigrum {5}non visibile, ex opposito ad Solem caeli, qui est Dominus.(n)  {6}Quod quaesiverint de Domino ac de Ipsius apparentia coram angelis 
e nostra tellure, dabatur illis, quoniam tunc placuit Domino Se praesentem sistere apud illos, ac in ordinem redigere quae ex malis ibi deturbata sunt, de quibus conquesti sunt; ut haec viderem, causa 
etiam erat quod illuc perductus sim. @1 Dein$ @2 i et quod$ @3 i sit$ @4 coelo$ @5 prorsus absconditum$ @6 Respondebant ad haec, quod etiam sciant quod ita sit, sed quod Dominus aliter appareat 
apud illos; haec dicere illis dabatur, quoniam tunc placuit Domino venire ad illos, ac se praesentem sistere, et ibi in ordinem redigeret quae ex malis ibi, et de quibus conquesti$ </p>
