<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5705节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5705.</strong>“这些人就彼此对望，惊奇不已”表在他们当中每一个人里面所发生的状态变化。这从“惊奇”和“彼此对望”的含义清楚可知：“惊奇”是指其思维状态上的始料不及的突然变化，由于这种变化造成惊奇，故在内义上所表相同；“彼此对望”是指在他们当中每一个人里面。因为所论述的主题是在良善之下真理的次序，这取决于内在的在场（参看<a href="5703.htm">5703</a>，<a href="5704.htm">5704</a>节），这次序因是新的，故带来他们当中每一个人里面的状态变化，这由“这些人就彼此对望，惊奇不已”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5705</b></p><p><b>5705.</b>
And the men were amazed, everyone at his companion. That this signifies a change of state of each one among them, is evident from the signification of "to be amazed," as being an unexpected and sudden 
change of state in the thoughts, which being the cause of the amazement is signified in the internal sense; and from the signification of "everyone at his companion," as being of each one among them; 
for the subject treated of is the order of truths under good caused by the presence of the internal (see n. 5703, 5704), and as the order is new, there is therefore a change of state of each one among 
them, which is signified by "the men being amazed, everyone at his companion." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5705</b></p><p><b>5705.</b>
'And the men were astonished [and looked] each at his companion' means a change of state that took place in each one among them. This is clear from the meaning of 'being astonished' as an unexpected 
and sudden change in the state of their thoughts (and since this change causes astonishment, the same is meant in the internal sense); and from the meaning of 'each at his companion' as in each one among 
them. For the subject is the order of the truths beneath good, determined by the presence of the internal, <a href="5703.htm">5703</a>, <a href="5704.htm">5704</a>, which order, being a new one, leads to a change of state in each one among them, 
meant by 'the men were astonished [and looked] each at his companion'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5705</b>
</p><b>5705.</b>
`Et obstupuerunt viri quisque ad socium suum':  quod significet mutationem status cujusvis inter se, constat ex significatione `obstupescere' quod sit inexspectata et subita mutatio status cogitationum; 
haec quia causa est stuporis, in sensu interno illa significatur; et ex significatione `quisque ad socium suum' quod sit cujusvis inter se; agitur enim de ordine verorum sub bono a praesentia interni, 
n. (x)5703, 5704, qui ordo quia novus, inde mutatio status cujusvis inter se, quae significatur per `obstupuerunt viri quisque ad socium suum'. </p>
