<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2776节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2776.</strong>“把他献为燔祭”表祂要将自己圣化为神性。这从希伯来民族和犹太教会中“燔祭”的代表清楚可知，“燔祭”是指其敬拜的至圣物。有燔祭，有献祭，至于这些代表什么，可参看前文（<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）。他们通过献燔祭或献祭而圣化，因此本节献“燔祭”表圣化为神性。因为主自己将自身圣化为神性，也就是说，祂通过试探的争战和胜利将人性与神性融合起来（参看<a href="1663.htm">1663</a>，<a href="1690.htm">1690</a>，<a href="1691.htm">1691</a>末尾，<a href="1692.htm">1692</a>，<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1787.htm">1787</a>，<a href="1812.htm">1812</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1820.htm">1820</a>节）。<br />人们普遍认为，燔祭和献祭是主十字架受难的标志，主凭十字架受难赎回所有人的罪；甚至认为祂将这些罪揽到自己身上，从而担当了它们。因此，凡相信的人只要认为，哪怕临终之际认为主为他们受难，就会称义并得救，不管他的整个一生过得是什么样的生活。可事实并非如此。十字架受难其实是主经受的最极端的试探，祂凭这试探将人性与神性，并神性与人性完全融合起来，从而荣耀祂自己。这种融合本身就是那些拥有对主之信，即仁之信的人能够得救所凭借的方法。至高无上的神性本身无法再抵达人类，因为人类已如此远离爱的属天之物和信的属灵之物，以致人们不再承认它们，更不用说接受了。因此，为了至高无上的神性能降临到处于这种状态的世人那里，主降世并在自己里面将人性与神性融合起来。这种融合只能通过最严厉的试探的争战，以及在这些试探中的胜利，最终通过终极试探，也就是十字架受难而实现。<br />正因如此，主通过神性人能启示人类心智。哪怕那些距离爱的属天事物极其遥远的人，只要具有仁之信，也能被启示。因为在来世，主向属天天使显为太阳，向属灵天使显为月亮（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>节），一切天堂之光皆从主流出。天堂之光具有这样的性质：它在照进灵人与天使眼里的同时，也启发他们的理解力。这种启发理解力的能力是那光天生固有的，因此在天上，人有多少外在之光，就有多少内在之光，即理解力之光。这表明，天堂之光不同于世间之光。既光照属灵之人的眼睛，又光照其理解力的，正是主的神性人。但是，若非主将人性本质与神性本质融合起来，这是不可能的事。若非主将它们融合起来，无论世人还是天上的属灵天使，都不再拥有理解或领悟善与真的任何能力，从而不再拥有任何幸福快乐，因此根本没有任何救赎。由此清楚可知，若非主披上人性并荣耀它，人类无法得救。谁都能由此推断出这一观念是真是假，即：人只要出于某种内在情感认为主为他们受难，担当他们的罪，就会得救，不管他们过得是什么样的生活。而事实上，从主的神性人所接受的天堂之光只能到达那些拥有信之善，即过着仁爱生活，或也可说拥有良知的人那里。天堂之光能进入其中作工的这一层面本身，也就是接受这光的容器，就是信之善，即仁爱，因而就是良知。属灵之人通过主的神性人而得救（参看<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>节）。</p>

And offer him there for a burnt-offering. That this signifies that He should sanctify Himself to the Divine, is evident from the representation of a burnt-offering among the Hebrew nation and in the 
Jewish church, as being the most holy thing of their worship. There were burnt-offerings and there were sacrifices, and what these represented may be seen above (n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180). Their sanctifications 
were made by means of them, and hence it is that by "offering up for a burnt-offering" is here signified to be sanctified to the Divine, for the Lord Himself sanctified Himself to the Divine, 
that is, united His Human to His Divine by the combats and victories of temptations (see n. 1663, 1690, 1691 at the end, 1692, 1737, 1787, 1812, 1813, 1820).  [2] It is a common belief at this day 
that the burnt-offerings and sacrifices signified the Lord's passion, and that by this the Lord made expiation for the iniquities of all; indeed, that He took them upon Himself, and thus bore them; and 
that those who believe are in this manner justified and saved, provided they think, even though it were in the last hour before death, that the Lord suffered for them, no matter how they may have lived 
during the whole course of their life.  But the case is not really so: the passion of the cross was the extremity of the Lord's temptation, by which He fully united His Human to His Divine and His 
Divine to His Human, and thus glorified Himself. This very union is the means by which those who have the faith in Him which is the faith of charity, can be saved. For the supreme Divine Itself could 
no longer reach to the human race, which had removed itself so far from the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith, that men no longer even acknowledged them, and still less perceived 
them. In order therefore that the supreme Divine might be able to come down to man in such a state, the Lord came into the world and united His Human to the Divine in Himself; which union could 
not be effected otherwise than by the most grievous combats of temptations and by victories, and at length by the last, which was that of the cross.  [3] Hence it is that the Lord can from His Divine 
Human illumine minds, even those far removed from the celestial things of love, provided they are in the faith of charity. For the Lord in the other life appears to the celestial angels as a Sun, and 
to the spiritual as a Moon (n. 1053, 1521, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495), whence comes all the light of heaven. This light of heaven is of such a nature that when it illumines the sight of spirits and angels, 
it also illumines their understanding at the same time. This is inherent in that light, so that in heaven so much as anyone has of external light, so much has he of internal light, that is, so much 
of understanding; which shows wherein the light of heaven differs from the light of the world. It is the Lord's Divine Human which illuminates both the sight and the understanding of the spiritual; 
which would not take place if the Lord had not united His Human Essence to His Divine Essence; and if He had not united them, man in the world would no longer have had any capacity of understanding and 
perceiving what is good and true, nor indeed would a spiritual angel in heaven have had any; so that they would have had nothing of blessedness and happiness, consequently nothing of salvation. From 
this we can see that the human race could not have been saved unless the Lord had assumed the Human and glorified it.  [4] Hence then anyone may infer what truth there is in the idea that men are saved 
if they only think from a kind of interior emotion that the Lord suffered for them, and took away their sins, however they may have lived; whereas the light of heaven from the Lord's Divine Human 
cannot reach to any but those who live in the good of faith, that is, in charity; or what is the same, those who have conscience. The very plane into which that light can operate, or the receptacle of 
that light, is the good of faith, or charity, and thus conscience. (That the spiritual have salvation from the Lord's Divine Human, may be seen above, n. 1043, 2661, 2716, 2718.) </p>

'Offer him as a burnt offering' means that He was to sanctify Himself to the Divine. This is clear from the representation of 'a burnt offering' among the Hebrew nation, and in the Jewish Church, as 
the holiest act of their worship. There were burnt offerings and there were sacrifices, and as regards what these represented, see <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>. Sanctifications were effected by means of burnt 
offerings and sacrifices, and that is why in this verse 'offering a burnt offering' means being sanctified to the Divine. For the Lord sanctified Himself to the Divine, that is, He united the Human to 
the Divine by means of the conflicts brought about by temptations, and by means of the victories in these, see <a href="1663.htm">1663</a>, <a href="1690.htm">1690</a>, <a href="1692.htm">1692</a> (end), <a href="1692.htm">1692</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1787.htm">1787</a>, <a href="1812.htm">1812</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="1820.htm">1820</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is generally believed 
at the present day that the burnt offerings and sacrifices were signs of the Lord's passion, and that by His passion the Lord atoned for the iniquities of all. Indeed it is believed that He drew 
away those iniquities on to Himself, and thus bore them Himself, so that those who believe are made righteous and are saved, if only they think, even in the last hour prior to death, that the Lord suffered 
on their behalf, no matter how they may have lived throughout the whole course of their lives. But such beliefs are mistaken. The passion of the Cross was the utmost degree of temptation endured 
by the Lord, by means of which He fully united the Human to the Divine and the Divine to the Human, and by doing this glorified Himself. That union itself is the means by which people possessing faith 
in Him that is grounded in charity are able to be saved. For the Supreme Divine Itself was no longer able to reach the human race which had removed itself so far away from the celestial things of love, 
and from the spiritual things of faith, that people did not even recognize them any more, let alone perceive them. Consequently to enable the Supreme Divine to come down to all such as this, the Lord 
came into the world and united the Human to the Divine within Himself. This union could not have been effected except by means of the very severe conflicts brought about by temptations and by means 
of victories in these, and at length by means of the final temptation, which was that of the Cross. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As a result of this the Lord is able from the Divine Human to enlighten human minds, even those 
that are quite remote from the celestial things of love, provided that faith grounded in charity is present in them. For in the next life the Lord appears to celestial angels as the Sun, and to spiritual 
angels as the Moon, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a> - all the light of heaven flowing from Him. The light of heaven is such that when it enlightens the eyes of spirits and angels it also at 
the same time enlightens their understanding. This ability to enlighten the understanding also exists inherently within that light, so that the amount of internal light, that is, of understanding, which 
anyone possesses in heaven is the same as the amount of external light he has. This shows the way in which the light of heaven is different from the light of the world. It is the Lord's Divine Human 
that enlightens both the eyes and the understanding of those who are spiritual, but this could never be done unless the Lord had united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. And unless He had united 
them neither men in the world, nor indeed any spiritual angel in heaven, would any longer have possessed any ability to understand or to perceive that which is good or true. Nor thus would they 
have possessed any blessedness and happiness at all, nor consequently any salvation at all. From this it becomes clear that the human race could not have been saved unless the Lord had assumed the Human 
and glorified it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From what has now been stated anyone may decide for himself the truth or otherwise of the idea that people are saved, no matter how they may have lived, if only they think 
from some inner emotion that the Lord suffered on their behalf and bore their sins. But in reality the light of heaven received from the Lord's Divine Human is able to reach none except those with whom 
there exists the good that accompanies faith, that is, who lead charitable lives, or what amounts to the same, who possess conscience. The level itself into which that light can operate, that is, the 
receptacle for that light, is the good that accompanies faith, which is charity and thus conscience. That those who are spiritual have salvation from the Lord's Divine Human, see <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>. </p>

Quod `offer eum in holocaustum' significet quod sanctificaret ipsum Divino, constat a repraesentatione `holocausti' apud gentem Hebraeam, et in Ecclesia Judaica, quod fuerit sanctissimum eorum cultus; 
erant holocausta et erant sacrificia, quae quid repraesentaverunt, videatur n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180; sanctificationes eorum fiebant per illa, inde est quod hic per `offerre in holocaustum' significetur 
sanctificari Divino, Dominus enim Ipse Se {1}sanctificavit Divino, hoc est, univit Humanum Divino per tentationum pugnas et victorias, videatur n. 1663, 1690, 1691f, 1692, 1737, 1787, 1812, 1813, 
1820. [2] Communis fides hodie est quod holocausta et sacrificia significaverint passionem Domini, et quod Dominus per illam expiaverit omnium iniquitates, immo quod in Se illas derivaverit et sic sustulerit; 
ita se justificari et salvari credentes, modo cogitent, si vel foret in ultima mortis hora, quod Dominus pro illis passus sit, utcumque per totum vitae suae curriculum vixerint; sed res non 
ita se habet; passio crucis luit ultimum tentationis Domini, per quam plenarie univit Humanum Divino et Divinum Humano, et sic Se glorificavit; ipsa illa unio est per quam salvari possunt illi qui fidem 
charitatis in Ipsum habent; nam Ipsum Supremum Divinum non potuit amplius pertingere ad humanum genus, quod se tantum removit a caelestibus amoris et spiritualibus fidei ut illa ne quidem magis agnoscerent, 
minus perciperent; idcirco, ut Supremum Divinum potuisset descendere ad hominem talem, Dominus venit in mundum et Humanum univit Divino in Se; quae unio non potuit aliter fieri quam per gravissimas 
tentationum pugnas et victorias, et tandem per ultimam, quae erat crucis: [3] inde est quod Dominus ex Divino Humano illuminare possit mentes etiam a caelestibus amoris remotiores, modo in fide 
charitatis sint; Dominus enim in altera vita caelestibus angelis apparet ut sol, et spiritualibus ut luna, n. 1053, 1521, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, omnis lux caeli est inde; lux caeli talis est ut cum 
illuminat visum spirituum et angelorum, etiam simul illuminet {2}intellectum; hoc inest luci illi, sic ut quantum lucis externae {3}alicui in caelo est, tantum lucis internae, hoc est, tantum intellectus 
illi sit; inde patet in quo lux caeli a luce mundi differt; Divinum Humanum Domini est quod illuminat et visum et intellectum spiritualium, quod non fieret nisi Dominus univerit Essentiam Humanam 
Divinae; et nisi univerit, nec fuisset aliquod intellectuale (c)et perceptivum boni et veri amplius homini in mundo, immo nec angelo spirituali in caelo, ita nec illis aliquid beati et felicis, consequenter 
nec aliquid salutis; inde constare potest quod genus humanum non salvari potuerit nisi Dominus assumpserit Humanum et hoc glorificaverit. [4] Inde nunc quisque concludere potest quomodo se habet 
cum hoc, quod salventur si modo cogitent ex interiore quadam commotione, quod Dominus passus sit pro illis et peccata eorum sustulerit, utcumque vixerint, cum tamen lux caeli ex Divino Humano Domini 
ad alios non potest pertingere quam ad illos qui in bono fidei, hoc est, in charitate vivunt, seu quod idem, qui conscientiam habent; ipsum planum in quod lux illa operari potest, seu receptaculum 
lucis illius, est bonum fidei, seu charitas, ita conscientia: quod spiritualibus ex Divino Humano Domini sit salus, videatur n. 1043, 2661, 2716, 2718. @1 sanctificaba$ @2 i eorum$ @3 ex caelo alicui ibi$ </p>
