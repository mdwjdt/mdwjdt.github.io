<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第43节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>43.</strong>创世记1:22 神就赐福给这一切，说：“要繁殖增多，充满海中的水；雀鸟也要增多在地上。”<br />凡内有主之生命者，皆能无限地繁殖增多。这在人活在肉身时尚有限度，到了灵界将达到惊人的程度。在圣经中，“繁殖”关乎爱，“增多”关乎信。爱所结的“果子”皆包有“核”，能自行繁殖增多。在圣经中，主的“祝福”也象征“繁殖”、“增多”，因为两者是主赐福的结果。<br />创世记1:23 有晚上，有早晨，是第五日。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]43.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_43/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_22" target=_top>Genesis 1:22</a>. And God blessed them, saying, "Reproduce and multiply and fill the water in the seas, and the birds will multiply on the land."<br />Everything with life from the Lord in it reproduces and multiplies beyond measure — not so much during our physical lives, but to an astounding degree in the next life.<br />In the Word, reproducing or being fruitful applies to the elements of love, and multiplying, to the elements of faith. Fruit born of love holds the seed by which it multiplies so prolifically.<br />The Lord's blessing in the Word also symbolizes fruitfulness and multiplication, because these are its result.<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_43/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_23" target=_top>Genesis 1:23</a>. And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. </p>

Verse 22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl shall be multiplied in the earth. Everything that has in itself life from the Lord fructifies 
and multiplies itself immensely; not so much while the man lives in the body, but to an amazing degree in the other life. To "be fruitful" in the Word, is predicated of the things that are of 
love, and to "multiply" of the things that are of faith; the "fruit" which is of love contains "seed" by which it so greatly multiplies itself. The Lord's "blessing" also in the Word signifies fructification 
and multiplication, because they proceed from it. Verse 23. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 43</b></p><p><b>43.</b>
Verse 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas; and let birds be multiplied upon the earth.  Everything that has life in it from the Lord is fruitful 
and multiplies without limit. This does not happen during a person's lifetime, but in the next life it does so to an astonishing extent. In the Word 'to be fruitful' has reference to matters of love, 
while 'to multiply' has reference to matters of faith. The fruit of love contains the seed by which it multiplies itself to so great an extent. The Lord' s blessing also means, in the Word, fruitfulness 
and multiplication, for they are the outcome of that blessing.   Verse 23 And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 43</b>
</p><b>43.</b>
Vers. 22.  Et bene dixit iis Deus, dicendo, Fructificate et multiplicate vos, et implete aquas in maribus; et avis multiplicabitur in terra.  Omne quod in se ex Domino vitam habet, se fructificat et 
multiplicat immensum; quamdiu homo in corpore vivit, non ita, sed in altera vita stupende. 'Fructificare' in Verbo praedicatur de illis quae sunt amoris, et 'multiplicare' de illis quae sunt fidei; fructus 
qui est amoris habet semen, per quod se tantum multiplicat. Benedictio Domini etiam significat in Verbo fructificationem et multiplicationem, quia hae ex illa. 	Vers. 23.  Et fuit vespera, et 
fuit mane, dies quintus. </p>
