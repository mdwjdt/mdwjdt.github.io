<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2759节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2759.</strong>在右上方，看似波浪的东西从低地上来。我被告知，他们是很多灵人，来自社会底层，没有受过教育，但并不邪恶。他们是农民和其他简单人。我与他们对话，他们说，他们知道主，并信靠祂的名。此外，他们对信及其奥秘知之甚少。后来，其他知道得稍微多一点的人也上来了。我发现他们的内在能被打开，在来世，这种可能性能被清楚发觉。他们拥有良知，这良知也传给我，好叫我了解它。并且我被告知，他们简单地活在婚姻之爱中。他们说，他们爱自己的配偶，弃绝任何淫行。他们以这种方式被良知所主导，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：他们说，他们不能以其它任何方式行事，因为这样做违背他们的意愿。这种人在来世接受教导，并在爱之善与信之真方面得以完善，最终被接纳到天使当中。</p>

On the right side there rose up from the lower earth as it were a roll; and it was said that they were many spirits from the lower class of people, untaught but not depraved. They were peasants and other 
simple people. I spoke with them, and they said that they know the Lord, to whose name they commend themselves. Further than this they knew little of faith and its mysteries. Afterwards others rose 
up who knew some little more. It was perceived that their interiors were capable of being opened; for in the other life this can be manifestly perceived. They had conscience, which was communicated 
to me, that I might know it; and it was said that they lived in conjugial love in simplicity. They said that they loved their consorts and abstained from adulteries. That this was from conscience was 
evident from their saying that they could not do otherwise, because it was contrary to their will. Such persons are instructed in the other life and are perfected in the good of love and truth of faith, 
and are at length received among the angels. </p>
<p>     Preface      [to volume 3 of the original Latin] </p>
<p>     How greatly they are deluded who remain in the sense of the letter alone, and do not 
search out the internal sense from other passages in the Word in which it is explained, is very evident from the many heresies, every one of which proves its dogmas from the literal sense of the Word; 
especially is this manifest from that great heresy which the insane and infernal love of self and the world has drawn from the Lord's words to Peter: </p>
<p>     I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon 
this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth shall 
be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens (Matt. 16:15-19). [2] They who press the sense of the letter think that these things were said of 
Peter, and that power so great was given him; although they are fully aware that Peter was a very simple man, and that he by no means exercised such power; and that to exercise it is contrary to the 
Divine. Nevertheless, as owing to the insane and infernal love of self and the world they desire to arrogate to themselves the highest power on earth and in heaven, and to make themselves gods, they explain 
this according to the letter, and vehemently defend it; whereas the internal sense of these words is, that Faith itself in the Lord, which exists solely with those who are in love to the Lord and 
in charity toward the neighbor, has that power; and yet not faith, but the Lord from whom faith is. By "Peter" there is meant that faith, as everywhere else in the Word. Upon this is the Church built, 
and against it the gates of hell do not prevail. This faith has the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and it shuts heaven lest evils and falsities should enter in, and opens heaven for goods and 
truths. This is the internal sense of these words. [3] The twelve apostles, like the twelve tribes of Israel, represented nothing else than all the things of such faith (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130 at 
the end). Peter represented faith itself, James charity, and John the goods of charity (see the preface to Genesis 18); in like manner as did Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, the firstborn sons of Jacob, in 
the representative Jewish and Israelitish Church, which is plain from a thousand passages in the Word. And as Peter represented faith, the words in question were said to him. From this it is manifest 
into what darkness those cast themselves, and others with them, who explain all things according to the letter; as those who so explain these words to Peter, by which they derogate from the Lord and arrogate 
to themselves the power of saving the human race. </p>

Over on the right side there came up out of the lower earth what looked like a rolling wave. I was told that it consisted of many spirits from the lower levels of society who were uneducated but not 
wicked. They were peasants and other simple people. I spoke to them, and they said that they knew the Lord to whose name they entrusted themselves. Beyond this their knowledge of faith and its mysteries 
was small. Others subsequently came up who knew somewhat more. I perceived that the interior parts of their minds were capable of being opened, for in the next life such possibilities may be perceived 
quite plainly. They possessed a conscience, which was communicated to me so that I might know of it, and I was told that they had lived in conjugial love in simplicity. They said that they loved their 
married partners and refrained from adultery of any kind. That in this way they were governed by conscience was clear from the fact that they said they were unable to behave in any other way since 
to do so was against their will. Such persons receive instruction in the next life and are perfected in the good of love and in the truth of faith; and at length they are received among the angels. </p>
<p>PREFACE<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> </p>
<p>How 
deluded those people are who confine themselves to the sense of the letter and do not look for the internal sense in other places where this is explained in the Word becomes quite clear 
from the great number of heresies there are, each one of which confirms its own doctrinal position from the literal sense of the Word. It is particularly clear from that great heresy which insane 
and hellish self-love and love of the world have made out of the Lord's words to Peter, </p>
<blockquote>
I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail 
against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:%2015-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16: 15-19</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[2]</b>
People who keep rigidly to the sense of the letter imagine that these words refer to the man Peter and that such great power was given to him. Although they know that Peter was just an ordinary 
simple human being who by no means exercised such power, and that the exercise of that power is contrary to the Divine, they nevertheless adopt and stoutly defend a literal interpretation of what the 
Lord said, because of the insane and hellish self-love and love of the world which fill them with the desire to arrogate such power to themselves on earth and in heaven and to make gods of themselves. 
But the internal sense of those words is that faith itself in the Lord, which exists solely with those in whom love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour are present, possesses that power, 
yet not faith but the Lord, the Source of faith. In the words addressed to Peter 'rock' is used to mean that faith, as it is everywhere else in the Word. It is on this faith that the Church is built, 
and against this faith that the gates of hell do not prevail. It is that faith also which holds the keys of the kingdom of heaven, for that faith closes heaven to prevent evils and falsities entering 
in, and it opens heaven to goods and truths. This is the internal sense of these words. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Like the twelve tribes of Israel the twelve apostles represented nothing else than all aspects of such faith, <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end). Peter represented faith itself, James charity, and John the good works that flow from charity - see the Preface to Gen. <a href="18.htm">18</a> - as in a similar way did Reuben, Simeon, and 
Levi, Jacob's three eldest sons, in the Jewish and </p>
<p>Israelitish representative Church, a point that is clear from a thousand places in the Word. And it was because Peter represented faith that those 
words were addressed to him. From all these considerations one may recognize what darkness it is into which people plunge themselves, and others with them, who explain everything literally, as they 
do who, taking literally the words addressed to Peter, use them to take the power of saving the human race away from the Lord and arrogate it to themselves.

{1} Ad latus dextrum e terra inferiore exsurgebat quasi volumen; dicebatur quod essent spiritus multi ex plebe indocta, non prava; fuerunt rustici et alii simplices; locutus cum iis; dicebant quod sciant 
Dominum, cujus nomini se commendant; praeterea parum noverunt de fide et ejus mysteriis; a postea exsurgebant, qui aliquantisper plus sciebant; quod interiora eorum potuissent aperiri, perceptum 
est, hoc enim in altera vita manifeste percipi potest; conscientiam habuerunt, quae mecum communicata, ut scirem, dictum quod in amore conjugiali simpliciter vixerint, dicebant quod conjuge amaverint, 
et ab adulteriis abstinuerint, quod haec ex conscientia, constabat eo quod dicerent se non aliter potuisse quia contra eorum voluntatem: tales informantur in altera vita, et perficiuntur in bono amoris 
et vero fidei; et denique recipiuntur inter angelos. 	@1 n. 2758 and 2579 were written and numbered in reverse order, but directions are inserted for their transposition.$
