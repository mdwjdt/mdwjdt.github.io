<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1001节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1001.</strong>“血”表仁爱。这从很多事上清楚可知。因此，它表重生的属灵之人从主那里接受的新意愿部分，这新意愿与仁爱完全相同，因为它是由仁爱形成的。事实上，仁爱，或爱是意愿的本质或生命，因为没人会说，他意愿某事，除非他乐在其中或热爱它。当人说他思考某事的时候，并不意味着他意愿这件事，除非意愿隐含在思考中。属仁爱的这个新意愿在此就是“血”，这意愿不是人的，而是在人里面的主的。由于它是主的，所以它永不可与人的意愿之物混在一起，前面说过，人的意愿极其污秽。正因如此，在代表性教会中，人们不可吃带灵魂的肉或血，也就是说，不可将这二者混在一起。“血”表仁爱，故表神圣之物；“肉”表人的意愿，故表亵渎之物。这些事物是对立的，所以完全分离，人们被禁止吃血。因为那时“吃带血的肉”在天堂代表亵渎，或将神圣之物和亵渎之物混在一起；在天堂，这种代表只会以恐怖攻击天使。因为那个时代，发生在这个教会成员中的一切事件，都会照着这类事所象征的内义而在天使当中被转化为相应的属灵的表现形式。<br />由于一切事物的性质皆取决于它们所涉及的那个人的性质，所以“血”的含义也是如此。当涉及重生的属灵之人时，“血”表对邻之仁或爱；当涉及重生的属天之人时，它表对主之爱；但当涉及主时，它表其整个人的本质，因而表爱本身，也就是祂对人类的怜悯。所以，由于“血”一般表爱和属爱之物，故它表唯独属主的天堂之物；因而涉及人时，它表人从主那里接受的属天之物。重生的属灵之人从主那里接受的属天之物是属天－属灵的，对此，蒙主慈悲，将在别处予以阐述。<br />“血”表属天之物，在至高义上表主的人之本质，因而表爱本身，或祂对人类的怜悯。这从代表性的犹太教会被要求取点血以示圣洁明显看出来。由于这个原因，血被称为“立约的血”。它被洒在那百姓身上，并且连同膏油被洒在亚伦和他的儿子身上。一切燔祭和祭物的血被洒在祭坛上面和周围（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.7.htm">12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.22.htm">22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.6.htm">24:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.8.htm">8</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.5.htm">1:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.6.htm">4:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.17.htm">17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.34.htm">34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.9.htm">5:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.14.htm">16:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.18.htm">18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.19.htm">19</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.17.htm">18:17</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.27.htm">12:27</a>）。<br />由于所取之血如此神圣，而人的意愿却如此不洁，所以他们严厉禁止吃血，因为这代表亵渎神圣之物。如摩西五经：<br />在你们一切的住处，脂油和血都不可吃。这要成为你们世世代代永远的定例。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.17.htm">3:17</a>）<br />“脂油”在此表属天的生命，“血”表属天-属灵的生命。属天-属灵之物就是来自属天源头的属灵之物。如在上古教会，对主的爱是属天的，因为这爱已植入在他们的意愿中；其属天-属灵之物则是由这爱而来的信（对此，参看<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="393.htm">393</a>，<a href="398.htm">398</a>节）。然而，对属灵之人而言，属天之物并不存在，他只有属天-属灵之物，因为仁被植入在其心智的觉知部分。摩西五经：<br />凡以色列家中的人，或是寄居在他们中间的外人，倘若有吃血的，我必向那吃血的灵魂变脸，把他从他的民中剪除，因为肉身的灵魂是在血中，我把这血赐给你们，可以在坛上为你们的灵魂赎罪，因血本身有灵魂，所以能赎罪。一切血肉之躯的灵魂，就在血中；凡吃了血的，必被剪除。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.10.htm">17:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处明确说明了肉体的灵魂在于血，肉体的灵魂就是血，或属天之物，即神圣之物，也就是主的物。<br /><br />只是你要心意坚定，不可吃血，因为血是灵魂，不可将灵魂与肉同吃。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.23.htm">12:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.25.htm">25</a>） <br />从这些话同样清楚看出，血被称为灵魂，即属天的生命，或属天之物，以那个教会的燔祭和祭物来代表。同样，不可将属天之物，即主的自我中心，与人的自我中心相混合，唯独主的自我中心是属天和神圣的，而人的自我中心是不洁的。这一点也是以下命令所代表的，即他们不可献上带有发酵之物的祭物的血（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.18.htm">23:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.25.htm">34:25</a>）。<br />发酵之物表败坏和污秽之物。<br />血被称为灵魂，并表仁爱的圣洁，在犹太教会中，爱的圣洁用血来代表。其原因在于，肉体的生命在于血。由于肉体的生命在于血，所以血是它的终级灵魂，以致血因此被称为肉体灵魂，或人的肉体生命所居之地。由于在代表性教会中，内在事物用外在事物来代表，故灵魂或属天的生命用血来代表。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1001.</strong> There is a great deal of evidence for the symbolism of blood as neighborly love.{*1} As a result, blood symbolizes a new will that the spiritual person who has been reborn receives from the Lord. This new will is the same thing as neighborly love, because the new will is formed of that love. Charity — love — is the vital essence itself of the will, or the life of the will. The only possible reason for saying we will something is that we favor or love it. We might say we think something, but that is not the same as willing it, unless the will lies behind the thought.<br />This new will, which is neighborly love, is the blood. The new will is not ours but is the Lord's in us. And since it is the Lord's, it must never be mixed together with the promptings of our own will, which again are quite foul. That is why the representative church had this proscription against eating flesh in its soul, that is, in its blood, meaning that people were not to mix the two together.<br />[2] Because blood symbolized charity, it symbolized what was holy; and because flesh symbolized human will, it symbolized what was profane. Since the two, being opposites, are separate, people were forbidden to eat blood. The reason was that the eating of flesh together with blood in those days presented to heaven a picture of profanation, or the intermingling of something sacred and something profane. Such a picture could not help striking the angels of the time with horror. In those days, everything that was happening among members of the church was being turned into a corresponding spiritual representation among the angels, in accord with its inner-sense symbolism.<br />Since meanings always depend on the individual they apply to, so does the symbolism of blood. In relation to a regenerate spiritual person, blood symbolizes charity, or love for one's neighbor. In relation to a regenerate person of heavenly character, it symbolizes love for the Lord. In relation to the Lord, however, it symbolizes his core human essence and therefore Love itself, that is, his mercy toward the human race. Since blood, then, symbolizes love and anything connected with love, in general it symbolizes heavenly traits, which are the Lord's alone. So in relation to humans, it symbolizes heavenly qualities that we receive from the Lord. The heavenly qualities that a regenerate spiritual person receives from the Lord are heavenly-spiritual ones (discussed elsewhere, by the Lord's divine mercy).{*2} [3] This fact — that blood symbolizes heavenly qualities and that in the highest sense it symbolized the Lord's core human essence and so love itself, or his mercy toward the human race — can be seen from the holiness that the representative Jewish religion was commanded to accord blood. On that account it was called the blood of the covenant and was spattered on the people. Along with the anointing oil, it was also spattered on Aaron and his sons.{*3} And the blood of every burnt offering and sacrifice was spattered on and around the altar. On these subjects, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_7" target=_top>Exodus 12:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_13" target=_top>13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_22-23" target=_top>22-23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_6" target=_top>24:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_8" target=_top>8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_1_5" target=_top>Leviticus 1:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_1_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_1_15" target=_top>15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_6-7" target=_top>4:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_17-18" target=_top>17-18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_25" target=_top>25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_30" target=_top>30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_34" target=_top>34</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_5_9" target=_top>5:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_14-15" target=_top>16:14-15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_18-19" target=_top>18-19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_numbers_18_17" target=_top>Numbers 18:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_12_27" target=_top>Deuteronomy 12:27</a>.{*4} [4] The reason the eating of blood was so strictly forbidden was that blood was considered this holy and human will is this profane, and the practice represented the profanation of something holy. Moses says, for instance:<br />It is an eternal statute throughout your generations, everywhere you live: you shall not eat any fat or any blood. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_3_17" target=_top>Leviticus 3:17</a>)<br />Fat stands for heavenly life, and blood (in this verse) for heavenly-spiritual life.<br />(A heavenly-spiritual entity is something spiritual that develops out of something heavenly. For example, love for the Lord was the heavenly trait belonging to people in the earliest church, because it was planted in their will. Their heavenly-spiritual possession was the faith that grew out of it, as described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30-38</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337" target=_top>337</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398" target=_top>398</a>. With spiritual people, on the other hand, a heavenly attribute is not possible, since love for others is planted in their intellectual side; they can have only a heavenly-spiritual dimension.)<br />In the same author:<br />Any from the house of Israel or from among the immigrants residing in your midst who may have eaten any blood — I will set my face{*5} against the souls eating blood, and I will cut them off from the midst of their people, because the soul of the flesh is in the blood. And I have given it to you [for use] on the altar, to make atonement over your souls, because the blood itself must atone for the soul. The soul of all flesh is its blood; everyone eating it will be cut off. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_17_10-11" target=_top>Leviticus 17:10-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_17_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />This says explicitly that the soul of flesh is in the blood and that the soul of flesh is the blood — the heavenly aspect, the sacred element, the Lord's possession.<br />[5] In the same author:<br />Set yourself firmly against eating blood, because the blood itself is the soul, and you shall not eat the soul with the flesh. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_12_23" target=_top>Deuteronomy 12:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_12_24" target=_top>24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_12_25" target=_top>25</a>)<br />These verses again show that blood is being called the soul, that is, heavenly life, or a heavenly quality, as represented by the burnt offerings and sacrifices of that religion. The prohibition in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_23_18" target=_top>Exodus 23:18</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_25" target=_top>34:25</a> against offering the blood of a sacrifice on top of yeast bread{*6} also represented a ban on mingling any heavenly aspect, which belongs to the Lord — and only what belongs to him is heavenly and sacred — with any distinctly human aspect, which is profane. Anything containing yeast symbolized what was corrupt and tainted.<br />[6] The reason blood is called soul and symbolizes the holiness of charity, and the reason it represented the holiness of love in the Jewish religion, is that it constitutes the life of the body. Since blood constitutes the life of the body, it is the body's outermost soul, so that we can call it the physical soul, or the vehicle of our physical life.{*7} And since external objects represented inner attributes in the representative churches, blood represented the soul, or heavenly life.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg has previously identified or discussed biblical support for the symbolic connection of blood with charity (love for one's neighbor) or, in a negative sense, with violence done to charity, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_330" target=_top>330</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_373" target=_top>373-374</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005" target=_top>1005</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1010" target=_top>1010</a>.

[Editors]<br />{*6} "Yeast bread" refers to bread leavened by a portion of active, fermented dough held over from a previous batch (sourdough). Such leavening was often a symbol of corruption, not only in biblical cultures but in the ancient world in general. Mosaic Law thus specified unleavened bread for certain sacred uses; see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_15" target=_top>Exodus 12:15</a>.

[SS]<br />{*7} Swedenborg is building on a very long tradition that held that the soul or higher mind controlled or operated the components of the body by means of "spirits," or very fine fluids or vapors, transmitted through the veins and arteries along with the blood. He states the same idea variously in his scientific works as well; see, for example, Dynamics of the Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955), part 2, 46, 199, 240; Draft on the Fiber (Swedenborg 1976a) 299, 374; The Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1744-1745] 1960) 334.

That the "blood" signifies charity, is evident from many things. Thus it signifies the new will part which the regenerate spiritual man receives from the Lord, and which is the same as charity, for the 
new will is formed of charity. Charity or love is the very essential or life of the will, for no one can say that he wills anything, except from choosing or loving it. To say that one thinks a thing 
is not to will it, unless willing is in the thought. This new will which is of charity is here the "blood" and this will is not the man's, but the Lord's in the man. And because it is the Lord's, it 
is never to be mingled with the things of man's will, and which are so foul, as has been shown. For this reason it was commanded in the representative church that they should not eat flesh with the soul 
or blood thereof, that is, should not mingle the two together.  [2] The "blood" because it signified charity, signified what is holy; and the "flesh" because it signified man's will, signified what 
is profane. And because these things are separate, being contrary, they were forbidden to eat blood; for by eating flesh with the blood was then represented in heaven profanation, or the mingling of 
what is sacred with what is profane; and this representation in heaven could not then but strike the angels with horror; for at that time all things existing with the man of the church were turned, 
among the angels, into corresponding spiritual representations, in accordance with the signification of the things in the internal sense. As the nature of all things is determined by that of the man of 
whom they are predicated, so also is the signification of "blood." Relatively to the regenerate spiritual man, "blood" signifies charity, or love toward the neighbor; relatively to the regenerate celestial 
man it signifies love to the Lord; but relatively to the Lord it signifies all His Human essence, consequently Love itself, that is, His mercy toward the human race. Hence "blood" in general, 
because it signifies love and what is of love, signifies celestial things, which are of the Lord alone; and thus relatively to man the celestial things which he receives from the Lord. The celestial things 
which the regenerate spiritual man receives from the Lord, are celestial spiritual-of which, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, elsewhere.  [3] That "blood" signifies what is celestial, and in the 
supreme sense signified the Human essence of the Lord, thus love itself, or His mercy toward the human race, is evident from the sanctity in which it was commanded that blood should be held in the Jewish 
representative church. For this reason blood was called the blood of the covenant, and was sprinkled upon the people, as also upon Aaron and his sons, together with the anointing oil; and the blood 
of every burnt offering and sacrifice was sprinkled upon and around the altar (see Exod. 12:7, 13, 22-23; 24:6, 8; Lev. 1:5, 11, 15; 4:6-7, 17-18, 25, 30, 34; 5:9, 16:14-15, 18-19; Num. 18:17; Deut. 
12:27).  [4] And because blood was held so sacred and man's will is so profane, the eating of blood was severely prohibited, on account of its representation of the profanation of what is holy. As 
in Moses: </p>
<p>     It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood (Lev. 3:17)."Fat" here denotes celestial life, and "blood" celestial 
spiritual life. The celestial spiritual is the spiritual which is from the celestial; as in the Most Ancient Church love to the Lord was their celestial, because implanted in their will; their 
celestial spiritual was the faith therefrom, of which see above (n. 30-38, 337, 393, 398). With the spiritual man, however, the celestial does not exist, but the celestial spiritual, because charity 
has been implanted in his intellectual part. Again in Moses: </p>
<p>     Whosoever of the house of Israel, or of the sojourner sojourning among them, eateth any manner of blood, I will set My faces against 
that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people; for the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make atonement for your souls; for it 
is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul. The soul of all flesh, it is the blood thereof; whosoever eateth it shall be cut off (Lev. 17:10, 11, 14). Here it is plainly shown that the soul of 
the flesh is in the blood, and that the soul of the flesh is the blood, or the celestial, that is, the holy, which is the Lord's. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     Be sure that thou eat not the blood; for the blood is 
the soul, and thou shalt not eat the soul with the flesh (Deut. 12:23-25).From this passage also it is evident that the blood is called the soul, that is, celestial life, or the celestial, which was 
represented by the burnt offerings and sacrifices of that church. And in the same way, that what is celestial, which is the Lord's Own [Domini Proprium]-which alone is celestial and holy-was not to be 
commingled with that which is man's own-which is profane-was also represented by the command that they should not sacrifice or offer the blood of the sacrifice on what was leavened (Exod. 23:18; 34:25). 
What was leavened signified what is corrupt and defiled. That blood is called the soul and signifies the holy of charity, and that the holy of love was represented in the Jewish Church by blood, 
is because the life of the body consists in the blood. And as the life of the body consists in the blood, this is its ultimate soul, so that the blood may be said to be the corporeal soul, or that in 
which is the corporeal life of man; and inasmuch as in the representative churches internal things were represented by external, the soul or celestial life was represented by the blood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1001</b></p><p><b>1001.</b>
'Blood' means charity, as becomes clear from many considerations, and so means the new will part which a regenerate spiritual person receives from the Lord. This new will part is identical with charity, 
for it is from charity that the new will takes form. Indeed charity, or love, is the essential element or the life of the will, for nobody can possibly say he wills something unless he takes delight 
in it or loves it. When people say they have something in mind this does not imply that they will it, unless will is implicit in thought. This new will which is one of charity is 'the blood' here. 
It is not the person's own but the Lord's residing with him. And because it is the Lord's it must never be mixed together with things that belong to the person's own will which, as stated, is so foul. 
This was the reason why in the representative Church people were commanded not to eat flesh with its soul, that is, not to eat the blood. That is to say, they were not to mix the one with the other. 
Because 'blood' meant charity it meant that which was holy, and because 'flesh' meant what belonged to the merely human will, it meant that which was unholy. And because these, being opposites, were quite 
separate, people were forbidden to eat blood. For in those times 'the eating of flesh together with the blood' was representative in heaven of profanation, or the mixing together of holy and unholy 
- which representation in heaven could do nothing else than strike the angels with horror. For at that period of time all things that took place among members of the Church were converted among angels 
- according to the meaning such things had in the internal sense - into corresponding spiritual representations.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the nature of everything depends on that of the person to whom it refers, 
the same holds true with regard to the meaning of blood. When it refers to a regenerate spiritual person 'blood' means charity or love towards the neighbour. When it refers to a regenerate celestial 
person it means love to the Lord. But when it refers to the Lord it means the whole of His Human Essence, and so Love itself, which is His mercy towards the human race. Consequently since 'blood' 
in general means love and what belongs to love, it means heavenly things that are the Lord's alone, and so in reference to man it means the heavenly things a person receives from the Lord. The heavenly 
things that a regenerate spiritual person receives from the Lord are celestial-spiritual. These in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt with elsewhere.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'blood' means heavenly things, and 
in the highest sense meant the Lord's Human Essence, and so Love itself, which is His mercy towards the human race, becomes clear from the sacredness that the Jewish representative Church was required 
to attach to blood. For this reason blood was called 'the blood of the covenant'. It was sprinkled over the people, and also, together with the anointing oil, over Aaron and his sons. And [the blood] 
of every burnt offering and sacrifice was sprinkled over and around the altar.

 Because blood was held to be so holy, and what belonged to the merely human will was so unholy, they were strictly forbidden to eat blood because this represented 
the profanation of what is holy, as in Moses, </p>

<p>'Fat' 
stands for celestial life, and 'blood' in this instance for celestial-spiritual life. The celestial-spiritual is that which is spiritual having a celestial origin, as with the Most Ancient Church. 
With them love to the Lord was the celestial because this had been implanted in their will, while that which was celestial-spiritual with them was faith flowing from it, dealt with in <a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, 
<a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="398.htm">398</a>. But with a spiritual person the celestial does not exist, only the celestial-spiritual, because charity is implanted in the understanding part of his mind. In the same author, </p>

<p>Here it is plainly stated that the soul of the flesh is in the blood and that the soul of [all] flesh is the blood, or that which

From these words similarly it is clear that the blood is called the soul, that is, celestial life, or that which is celestial, and was represented by the burnt offerings and sacrifices 
of that Church. In a similar way, it was the requirement not to mingle that which was celestial - the Lord's Proprium, which alone is celestial and holy - with man's proprium, which is unholy, 
that was represented also by their being forbidden to make a sacrifice of, that is, to offer, the blood of the sacrifice with anything leavened, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:18;%2034:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:18; 34:25</a>.

That which was 'leavened' meant that

<p><b>[6]</b>
 The reason Why 'blood' is called the soul and means the holiness of charity, and why the holiness of love was represented in the Jewish Church by 'blood', is that 
the life of the body lies in the blood. And because the life of the body lies in the blood it is its ultimate soul, so that the blood therefore may be called the bodily soul, or the place where a person's 
bodily life resides. And because in representative Churches internal things were represented by external, the soul or celestial life was therefore represented by 'the blood'.

Quod 'sanguis' significet charitatem, a multis constare potest; ita novum voluntarium quod homo regeneratus spiritualis accipit a Domino; hoc novum voluntarium idem est ac charitas, nam ex charitate 
formatur nova voluntas; charitas enim seu amor est ipsum essentiale seu vita voluntatis, nam nusquam aliquis dicere potest quod velit nisi ex eo quod diligat aut amet illud; quod dicant se cogitare illud, 
non est velle nisi velle cogitationi insit: haec nova voluntas quae est charitatis, est hic sanguis; quae voluntas non est hominis sed Domini apud hominem; quae quia Domini, nusquam commiscenda 
est cum illis quae sunt voluntatis hominis, quae tam foeda, ut dictum; ideo in Ecclesia repraesentativa mandatum, ut 'non comederent carnem in anima ejus, seu sanguinem,' hoc est, quod non commiscerent. 
'Sanguis' quia significabat charitatem, significabat sanctum; et 'caro' quia significabat voluntarium hominis, significabat profanum, quae quia separata sunt, nam contraria, vetitum ne sanguinem comederent; 
nam per 'esum carnis cum sanguine' repraesentabatur tunc in caelo profanatio, seu commixtio sancti et profani; quae repraesentatio in caelo non potuit aliter tunc quam horrorem angelis incutere; 
nam tunc temporis omnia quae existebant apud hominem Ecclesiae, vertebantur, secundum significationem rerum in sensu interno, in repraesentationes spirituales correspondentes apud angelos.  [2] Quia 
omnia se habent respective ad hominem de quo praedicantur, ita quoque significatio sanguinis; 'sanguis' respective ad hominem regeneratum spiritualem significat charitatem seu amorem erga proximum; 
respective ad hominem regeneratum caelestem significat amorem in Dominum; at respective ad Dominum, significat omnem Humanam Ipsius Essentiam, proinde ipsum Amorem, hoc est, Ipsius misericordiam erga 
genus humanum; inde 'sanguis' in genere, quia amorem et quae amoris, significat caelestia quae solius Domini sunt; ita respective ad hominem caelestia quae homo accipit a Domino; caelestia quae homo 
regeneratus spiritualis accipit a Domino, sunt caelestia spiritualia, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi. [3] Quod 'sanguis' significet caelestia, et in supremo sensu significaverit  Humanam 
Domini Essentiam, ita ipsum Amorem, seu Ipsius misericordiam erga genus humanum, constare potest a sanctitate qua mandatum ut haberetur sanguis in Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica; ideo sanguis appellatus 
'sanguis foederis'; et sparsus super populum; tum super Aharonem et filios ejus una cum oleo unctionis; et [sanguis] omnis holocausti et sacrificii super altare et circum altare, de quibus Exod.

tam profanum est, ideo ob repraesentationem profanationis sancti, tam severe prohibitum fuit ne sanguis comederetur, ut apud Mosen, 	Statutum aeternitatis in generationes vestras, in omnibus habitationibus

<p>'adeps' pro vita caelesti, et 'sanguis' ibi pro caelesti spirituali; caeleste spirituale est spirituale quod a caelesti; 
sicut apud Antiquissimam Ecclesiam, amor in Dominum caeleste eorum fuit quia voluntati eorum implantatum, caeleste spirituale eorum erat fides inde, de qua n. 30-38, 337, 393, 398, at apud hominem 
spiritualem non datur caeleste, quia charitas implantata est in parte ejus intellectuali, sed caeleste spirituale: apud eundem, 	Quisquis e domo Israelis aut e peregrino peregrinante in medio eorum, 
qui comederit ullum sanguinem; et dabo 	facies Meas contra animam comedentem sanguinem, et exscindam eam e medio populi ejus; quia anima carnis in sanguine illa; et Ego dedi illum vobis super altare, 
ad expiandum super animas vestras; quia sanguis ipse pro anima expiabit.... Anima omnis carnis sanguis ejus ipse; omnis comedens illum exscindetur, Lev. xvii 10, 11, 14; </p>
<p>	ibi manifeste quod anima 
carnis in sanguine, et quod anima carnis sanguis, seu caeleste, hoc est, sanctum quod Domini: [5] apud eundem, 	Confirma te ut non comedas sanguinem, quia sanguis ipse anima, et non comedes animam cum 
carne, Deut. xii 23-25; </p>
<p>ex his similiter constat quod sanguis dicatur anima, hoc est, vita caelestis, seu caeleste, quod per holocausta et sacrificia ipsius Ecclesiae repraesentabatur; ne quoque caeleste, 
quod Domini Proprium, quod solum caeleste et sanctum est, commisceretur cum proprio hominis, quod profanum, repraesentatum quoque fuit per id quod 	Non super fermentato sacrificarent seu mactarent 
sanguinem sacrificii, Exod. xxiii 18; xxxiv 25; </p>
<p>[6]	'fermentatum' significabat corruptum et spurcum.  Quod 'sanguis' dicatur anima et significet sanctum charitatis, et quod sanctum amoris repraesentatum 
in Ecclesia Judaica per 'sanguinem,' inde est quia vita 'corporis consistit in sanguine; et quia vita corporis consistit in sanguine: est ejus ultima anima, ita ut sanguis dici queat anima 
corporea, seu in quo vita corporea hominis; et quia in Ecclesiis repraesentativis interna per externa repraesentata fuerunt, ideo anima seu vita caelestis per 'sanguinem.' </p>
