<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1480节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1480.</strong>“埃及人看见那妇人极其美貌”表由认知构成的知识具有令人极度愉悦的性质。这从前面所述（12:11）清楚可知，大意是，童年时的知识就具有这样的性质。 这种倾向仿佛是知识所固有的，因为它是人与生俱来的。起初，它以仅仅为知道而知道为乐，没有其它目的。这就是每个人的情形：他的灵以知道为大乐，以致它几乎不再渴望更好的了，知识成了它赖以维持和更新的食物，如同外在人依赖世俗的食物。这种滋养他灵的物质被传给外在人，以便让外在人适合服务于内在人。这些食物依次存在，顺序如下：属天的食物包含在从主所接受的爱与仁的一切食物中；而属灵食物则包含在信的一切真理中；这些就是天使赖以存活的各种食物。由它们而来的食物同样是属天、属灵的，但属于低等天使级别，是天使灵赖以存活的食物；再由此而来的则是更为低级的属天、属灵的食物，就是理性的食物，以及由此而来的知识的食物，它们是善灵赖以存活的食物；最后则是身体食物，它们适合活在肉身的人。所有这些食物都以奇妙的方式彼此对应。由此也明显可知，知识为何并如何最令人愉悦，因这种愉悦如同食欲和味道；因此，世人的吃饭就对应于灵人界的知识；食欲和味道本身则对应于对这些知识的强烈渴望；这从经验明显可知，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1480.</strong> That the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful, means that the study of religious knowledge is pleasing for its own sake. This can be seen from remarks above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1480/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_11" target=_top>11</a> showing that the study of knowledge is like this in our youth.{*1} It is more or less intrinsic to factual knowledge (because it is intrinsic to human beings) that at the very start we take pleasure in it for no other purpose than that of knowing. Each of us is like this. Our spirit finds intense delight in knowing 钬?so intense that there is hardly anything we prefer. Factual knowledge is food for the spirit, which is sustained and refreshed by it, just as our outer self is sustained and refreshed by earthly food. This food for our spirit is something that is communicated to our outer self to enable it to adapt to the inner self.<br />[2] The different types of this food, though, arrange themselves in a hierarchy: Heavenly food is every benefit of love and charity received from the Lord. Spiritual food is every true tenet of faith. These two types of food are what an angel lives on. From them comes a kind of food that is also heavenly and spiritual but angelic in a lower degree, and this is the food that an angelic spirit lives on. From this too comes an even more humble type of heavenly and spiritual food, which has to do with reason and therefore with factual knowledge. It is the food that good spirits live on. In last place comes food for the body, which is our proper food during bodily life. These types of food correspond to each other in a miraculous way.<br />This too shows why and how academic studies can provide their own satisfaction. They resemble appetite and the sense of taste. So the meals we eat on earth correspond to facts in the world of spirits, and appetite and taste themselves correspond to a craving for education. This can be seen from my experiences, discussed later [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1480/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4791" target=_top>4791-4795</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1480/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4801" target=_top>4801</a>], the Lord in his divine mercy willing.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The description in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1480/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_11" target=_top>11</a> of Sarai as a beautiful woman is discussed in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1480/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1470" target=_top>1470</a>.

And the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful. That this signifies that the memory-knowledge of knowledges is of such a nature as to be highly pleasing to itself, is evident from what 
was before said, at verse 11, that such is the nature of memory-knowledge during childhood; for this is as it were innate in memory-knowledge, because it is innate in man, that at the very first it pleases 
for no other end than for the sake of knowing. Such is every man; his spirit is greatly delighted to know, so that there is scarcely anything it desires more; this is its food, by which it is sustained 
and refreshed, as the external man is by earthly food. This sustenance, which is that of his spirit, is communicated to the external man, to the end that this may be adapted to the internal man. 
But the various foods succeed one another in the following order: celestial food is all the good of love and charity from the Lord; spiritual food is all the truth of faith: on these foods the angels 
live; and from them comes forth the food, likewise celestial and spiritual, but of a lower angelic degree, on which angelic spirits live; from this again there comes a still lower celestial and spiritual 
food, which is that of reason and thence of memory-knowledge, on which good spirits live; and lastly comes corporeal food, which is proper to man while he lives in the body. These foods correspond 
to one another in a wonderful manner. From this it is also evident why and how memory-knowledge is very pleasing to itself; for the case therewith is the same as it is with appetite and taste; and 
therefore eating, with man, corresponds to memory-knowledges in the world of spirits; and appetite and taste themselves correspond to the desire for these knowledges; as is evident from experience, concerning 
which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

That the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful' means that the knowledge which is comprised of cognitions is to itself highly pleasing. This is clear from what has been stated above at 
verse 11, to the effect that in childhood knowledge is of such a nature. Within knowledge an inclination so to speak exists - for that inclination is innate in man - which disposes it first of all to 
take pleasure in knowing just for the sake of knowing, and with no other end in view. This is so with everyone: his spirit takes great delight in knowing, so that it scarcely desires anything better, 
knowledge being its food by which it is sustained and renewed, as the external man is by earthly food. And this which nourishes his spirit is communicated to the external man to the end that the external 
man may be adapted so as to serve the internal. These foods exist consecutively, in the following order: Celestial food consists in every good of love and charity received from the Lord, while spiritual 
food consists in every truth of faith; these are the kinds of food by which angels live. From these comes the food - also celestial and spiritual, but of a lower angelic degree - by which angelic 
spirits live. And from this again comes celestial and spiritual food of a still lower degree, which is that of reason and from this of knowledge, by which good spirits live. Last of all comes bodily 
food, which is proper to man while he lives in the body. All these foods correspond to one another in a remarkable manner. From this it is also evident why and how knowledge is to itself most pleasing, 
for that pleasure is as appetite and taste; therefore also eating with man corresponds in the world of spirits to facts, and appetite and taste themselves to the intense desire for facts, as is clear 
from experience which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be presented further on. </p>

'Et viderunt Aegyptii feminam, quod pulchra illa valde': quod significet scientiam cognitionum quod sibi perplaceat, constat ab illis quae supra ad vers. 11 dicta sunt, quod scientia talis in pueritia 
sit: est enim innatum quasi scientiae, quia homini, ut omnium primum placeat ob nullum alium finem quam propter scire; unusquisque homo est talis; spiritus perquam delectatur scire ut vix prius cupiat; 
est ejus cibus quo sustentatur et recreatur, sicut externus homo a cibo terrestri; ille victus qui est spiritus ejus, communicatur externo homini, ob finem ut externus homo adaptetur interno; sed 
cibi illi hoc ordine sibi succedant: cibus caelestis est omne bonam amoris et charitatis a Domino, cibus spiritualis est omne verum fidei; ex his cibis vivunt angeli; exinde existit cibus qui quoque 
caelestis et spiritualis est, sed inferior angelicus ex quo vivunt spiritus angelici; ex hoc iterum cibus adhuc inferior caelestis et spiritualis qui est rationis et inde scientiae; ex hoc vivunt spiritus 
boni; ultimo venit cibus corporeus qui est homini, cum vivit in corpore, proprius; hi cibi mirabiliter sibi correspondent; inde quoque patet cur et quomodo sibi perplacet scientia, se enim habet 
sicut appetitus et gustus, quare etiam scientificis in mundo spirituum, correspondet esus apud hominem, et scientiarum cupidini ipse appetitus et gustus, quod ab experientia constat, de qua, ex Divina 
Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
