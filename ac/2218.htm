<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2218节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2218.</strong>“那些人就从那里起身”表那直觉结束了。这从“起身”和前面所论述的“那些人”的含义清楚可知，“起身”是指离开。那三人或耶和华来到亚伯拉罕面前代表主的神性直觉，如前所示。那时，主来自神性的直觉首先是祂对神性本身和神性人，以及源于二者的活动这圣三一的直觉，然后是对其人性的直觉，即它要披上神性。随之而来的其神性直觉是有关那时人类品质的。这三个事项就是本章依次所论述的，也就是说，神性披上人性，使之变成神性，以便祂能拯救全人类。关于前两项，此处说那直觉结束了，这就是“那些人起身”的内义所表示的。但关于人类品质的直觉在内义上由“面向所多玛观看，亚伯拉罕也与他们同行”这些话来表示；主不愿再停留在那直觉中的事实在内义上则由“亚伯拉罕也与他们同行，要送他们一程”这些话来表示。从概览（<a href="2136.htm">2136</a>-<a href="2141.htm">2141</a>节）和下文的解释能更好地看清这些事。</p>

The men rose up. That this signifies that that perception came to an end, is evident from the signification of "rising up," as being to go away; and from that of the "men," described above. By the coming 
of the three men, or of Jehovah, to Abraham, was represented the Lord's Divine perception, as shown above. The Lord's perception from the Divine at that time was first concerning the Divine Trine, 
which is the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Proceeding. Afterwards it was concerning His Human, that it should put on the Divine. Now follows a perception from the Divine concerning the human 
race, as regards its quality. These three things are what are treated of in this chapter, and they follow in order, namely, that the Divine assumed the Human, and made this Divine, in order that it 
might save the human race. Concerning the former two it is said that the perception came to an end, which is meant in the internal sense by the "men rising up;" but the perception concerning the human 
race, as regards its quality, is signified in the internal sense by their "looking to the faces of Sodom, and by Abraham going with them;" and that the Lord did not will to remain in that perception, 
is signified by Abraham "going with them to send them away." How the case is with these things can be better seen from the Contents which were premised, as also from the explication of what follows. </p>

That 'the men rose up [from there]' means that that perception came to an end becomes clear from the meaning of 'rising up' as going away, and from that of 'the men', dealt with above. The coming of 
the three men or of Jehovah to Abraham represented the Lord's Divine Perception, as shown above. The Lord's Perception from the Divine at that time was first His Perception regarding the Divine Trinity 
of the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and that which Proceeds from these, and then regarding His Human, that it was to put on the Divine. Now there follows His Perception from the Divine regarding 
the character of the human race at that time. These three considerations are what this chapter deals with, and they come in the following order - the Divine assumed the Human, and made this Divine, so 
that He might save the human race. Regarding the first two considerations it is said that the Perception came to an end, which is what is meant in the internal sense by the words 'the men rose up'. 
But that Perception regarding the character of the human race is meant in the internal sense by the words 'they looked towards the face of Sodom, and Abraham went with them'; and the fact that He had 
no wish to remain any longer in that Perception is meant by the words 'he went with them to send them on their way'. But a better sight of these matters may be gained from the preliminary Contents above,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
and also from the explanation given below of what follows.

</p><b>2218.</b>
Quod `surrexerunt viri' significet quod perceptio illa finiretur, constare potest a significatione `surgere' quod sit abire; et a `virorum' de quibus supra: per adventum trium virorum seu Jehovae ad 
Abrahamum repraesentata fuit Perceptio Divina Domini, ut supra ostensum; Perceptio Domini ex Divino tunc fuit primum de Trino Divino, quod est Divinum Ipsum, Humanum Divinum (c)et Procedens; postea fuit 
de Humano Ipsius quod indueret Divinum; nunc sequitur Perceptio ex Divino de genere humano quale esset.  Haec tria sunt, de quibus in hoc capite agitur, (m)et sequuntur ordine, nempe quod Divinum 
assumeret Humanum et hoc faceret Divinum, ut salvaret genus humanum(n): de prioribus binis dicitur quod Perceptio finita [sit], quod in sensu interno intelligitur per quod `surrexerunt viri'; at Perceptio 
de genere humano quale esset, significatur in sensu interno per quod `prospexerunt ad facies Sodomae, et Abraham vadens cum illis'; et quod in illa perceptione non vellet manere, significatur per 
quod `vaderet cum illis ad dimittendum illos'; quomodo se haec habent, melius videri potest a Contentis quae praemissa (o)sunt, tum ab explicatione sequentium. </p>
