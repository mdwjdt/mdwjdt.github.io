<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9146.</strong>“站着的庄稼，或是田地”表或对孕育过程中的信之真理和良善。这从“站着的庄稼”和“田地”的含义清楚可知：“站着的庄稼”是指信之真理，如下文所述；“田地”是指良善方面的教会，因而是指教会的良善（参看<a href="9139.htm">9139</a>节）。“站着的庄稼”之所以表示信之真理，是因为各种不同的庄稼，如如小麦和大麦，以及用它们制成的饼，表示教会的良善（<a href="3941.htm">3941</a>，<a href="7602.htm">7602</a>节）。教会的良善就是对邻之仁和对主之爱的良善。这些良善是信的存在和灵魂，因为信凭它们而为信并存活，或说它们使信成为信，并赋予它生命。“站着的庄稼”之所以表示孕育过程中的信之真理，是因为它尚未被收割成捆，或存到粮仓中。因此，当庄稼站立或尚在生长时，它表示孕育过程中的信之真理。<br />在何西阿书，“站着的庄稼”所表相同：<br />以色列立君王，却不由我；他们立首领，我却不知道。他们用金银制造偶像。他们所种的是风，所收的是旋风；他没有站着的庄稼；穗子必不出面粉。即便出面粉，外邦人也必吞吃它。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.4.htm">8:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处论述的是教会的信之真理和良善，它们被空洞、虚假的观念驱散，已经化为乌有。所论述的主题就是这些事物，这一点从整个思路明显看出来；关于它们所说的实际内容从内义清楚可知。因为就内义而言，“君王”表示整体上教会的信之真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）；“首领”表示首要真理（<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）；由此可见“以色列立君王，却不由我；他们立首领，我却不知道”是什么意思；因为“以色列”是指教会（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）。此处的“银”在内义上表示良善之真理，在反面意义上表示邪恶之虚假（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6112.htm">6112</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>节）；“金”表示良善，在反面意义上表示邪恶（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>节）；“偶像”表示由虚假和邪恶构成的敬拜（<a href="8941.htm">8941</a>节）；由此可见“他们用金银制造偶像”表示什么。“他们所种的风”表示毫无意义的观念，或一文不值的东西；“他们所收的旋风”表示由此在教会中产生的混乱；“他们所没有的站着的必吞吃庄稼”表示孕育过程中的信之真理；“不出面粉的穗子”表示不生育；“必吞吃它的外邦人”表示将吞噬它的虚假。</p>

Or the standing crop, or a field. That this signifies the truth and the good of faith in their conception, is evident from the signification of "standing crop," as being the truth of faith (of which 
below); and from the signification of "field," as being the church in respect to good, thus the good of the church (see n. 9139). That "standing crop" denotes the truth of faith, is because the different 
kinds of crop, as wheat and barley, and the bread from these, signify the goods of the church (n. 3941, 7602). The goods of the church are those of charity toward the neighbor and of love to the Lord. 
These goods are the being and the soul of faith, for by virtue of them faith is faith, and lives. That "standing crop" denotes the truth of faith in its conception, is because it has not yet been 
gathered into stacks, nor brought into barns; and therefore while it is standing, or is as yet growing, it denotes the truth of faith in its conception. [2] The like is signified by "standing crop" 
in Hosea: </p>
<p>     They [Israel] have made a king, and not by Me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; their silver and their gold they have made into idols. Because they sow the wind, they shall reap 
the whirlwind; he hath no standing crop; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers all swallow it up (Hos. 8:4, 7); </p>
<p>the truths and goods of the faith of the church are here treated 
of, which are dispersed by things empty and false. That these things are treated of, is evident from the series; but what is said of them is evident from the internal sense; for in this sense by "a 
king" is meant the truth of the faith of the church in the complex (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 6148); by "princes" are signified primary truths (n. 1482, 2089, 5044); and 
from this it is evident what is meant by "they [Israel] have made a king, and not by Me; they have made princes, and I knew it not;" for "Israel" denotes the church (n. 4286, 6426, 6637). By "silver" 
is here signified the truth of good, and in the opposite sense the falsity of evil (n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 8932); by "gold" is signified good, and in the opposite sense evil (n. 113, 
1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932); by "idols" is signified worship from falsities and evils (n. 8941); and from this it is evident what is signified by "their silver and their gold they have made 
into idols." By "the wind which they sow" are signified worthless things; by "the whirlwind which they shall reap" is signified the resulting disturbance in the church; by "the standing crop which they 
have not" is signified the truth of faith in its conception; by "the blade which shall yield no meal" is signified barrenness; by "the strangers who shall swallow it up" are signified the falsities 
which shall consume. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9146</b></p><p><b>9146.</b>
'Or standing grain, or a field' means the truth and good of faith in the process of being conceived. This is clear from the meaning of 'grain' as the truth of faith, dealt with below; and from the meaning 
of 'a field' as the Church in respect of good, thus the Church's good, dealt with above in <a href="9139.htm">9139</a>. The reason why 'grain' means the truth of faith is that grain crops, such as wheat and barley, and 
bread made from them, mean the Church's forms of good, <a href="3941.htm">3941</a>, <a href="7602.htm">7602</a>. The Church's forms of good are those of charity towards the neighbour and of love to the Lord. These forms of good are the being and 
soul of faith; for they are what cause faith to be faith and give it life. The reason why 'standing grain' is the truth of faith in the process of being conceived is that it has not yet been gathered 
into stacks or stored away in barns. Therefore when grain is standing or still shooting up it is the truth of faith in the process of being conceived.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Much the same is meant by 'standing grain' 
in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
Israel has made a king, and not by Me; they have made princes, and I did not know. Their silver and their gold they have made into idols. Because they sow the wind, they will reap the 
whirlwind. He does not have any standing grain; the ears will yield no flour. If they do yield it, aliens will swallow it up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%208:4,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 8:4, 7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Church's truths and forms of the good 
of faith when they have been reduced to nothing by hollow and false ideas. The fact that these things are the subject is evident from the train of thought, but what is actually being said about them 
is evident only from the internal sense. For in this sense 'a king' is used to mean the Church's truth of faith in its entirety, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>, <a href="6148.htm">6148</a>, and 'princes' 
to mean primary truths, <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>; and from all this one may see what is meant by the words 'Israel has made a king, and not by Me; they have made princes, and I did not know', 'Israel' 
being the Church, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>. By 'silver' is meant in the internal sense the truth of good, and in the contrary sense the falsity of evil, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6112.htm">6112</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>, by 'gold' is 
meant good, and in the contrary sense evil, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>, and by 'idols' is meant worship consisting of falsities and evils, <a href="8941.htm">8941</a>; and from all this one may see what is meant 
by 'their silver and their gold they have made into idols'. 'The wind' which they sow means senseless ideas; 'the whirlwind' which they will reap means the resulting turmoil in the Church; 'the standing 
grain' which he does not have any of means the truth of faith in the process of being conceived; 'the ears' which will yield no flour means sterility; and 'aliens' who will swallow it up means 
falsities that will consume it.  </p>

`Aut seges stans aut ager': quod significet verum et bonum {1} fidei in conceptione, constat ex significatione `segetis' quod sit verum fidei, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `agri' quod sit 
Ecclesia quoad bonum, ita bonum Ecclesiae, de qua supra n. 9139.  Quod `seges' sit verum fidei, est quia illa quae segetis sunt, ut triticum et hordeum, (c)ac inde panis, (x)significant bona Ecclesiae, 
(o)n. 3941, 7602; bona Ecclesiae sunt quae charitatis erga proximum et amoris in Dominum; haec bona sunt esse et {2} anima fidei, nam ex illis fides est fides, (c)et vivit; quod `seges stans' sit verum 
fidei in conceptione, est quia nondum collecta est in acervos nec illata in horrea; quapropter seges cum stat, aut {3} adhuc in nascentia est, est verum fidei in conceptione; [2] simile per `segetem 
stantem' significatur apud Hoscheam, 	Israel regem fecerunt, et non a Me; principes fecerunt,et non novi; argentum suum et aurum suum fecerunt idola: quia ventum serunt, procellam metent; seges stans 
non illi, germen non faciet farinam; si forte fecerit, alieni deglutient illam, viii 4, 7; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de veris et bonis fidei Ecclesiae dissipatis per vana et falsa; quod de illis agatur, patet a 
serie rerum, sed quid de illis dicitur, patet ex sensu interno; in hoc sensu enim per `regem' intelligitur verum fidei Ecclesiae in complexu, videatur n. 1672, 2015, (x)2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 
4966, 5044, 6148, per `principes' vera primaria, n. 1482, 2089, 5044; inde patet quid intelligitur per quod `Israel regem fecerunt, et non a Me, principes fecerunt, et (o)non novi,' `Israel' enim est 
Ecclesia, n. 4286, 6426, 6637; per `argentum' (o)ibi significatur verum boni, (c)ac in opposito sensu falsum mali, n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 8932, per `aurum' bonum, ac in opposito sensu 
malum, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, per `idola' cultus ex falsis et malis, n. 8941; inde patet quid significatur per `argentum suum et aurum suum fecerunt idola'; per `ventum quem serunt'
