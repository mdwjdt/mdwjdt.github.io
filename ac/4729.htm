<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4729节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4729.</strong>“就说有邪恶的野兽把他吞了”表出于恶欲的生命所捏造的谎言。这从“野兽”的含义清楚可知，“野兽”是指情感或恶欲望（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>节）；因为“野兽”在真正意义上表示活物（<a href="774.htm">774</a>，<a href="841.htm">841</a>，<a href="908.htm">908</a>节）；因此，“邪恶的野兽”在此表示恶欲的生命。显然，这是一个谎言；这谎言与前文（即他们将神性真理扔在虚假当中）有关，是一个出于恶欲的生命所捏造的谎言。因为虚假有三个源头，一个是教会的教义，另一个是感官谬误或幻觉，第三个是恶欲的生命。由教会的教义所产生的虚假只占据人心智的理解力部分；因为他从小就被说服这种虚假是真理，后来渐渐到来的确认事物又强化了这种说服。但由感官谬误或幻觉所产生的虚假对理解力部分没有那么大的影响；因为那些出于感官谬误或幻觉陷入虚假的人几乎没有从理解力得到什么洞察，因为他们的思维建立在底层观念和感官印象之上。然而，由恶欲所产生的虚假则源于意愿本身，或也可说，源于内心；因为人渴慕他发自内心所意愿的。这种虚假是最坏的，因为它根深蒂固，并且若不通过从主所接受的新生命，就无法被根除。<br />众所周知，人里面有两种内在官能，即理解力和意愿。理解力所吸收并充满之物不会因此进入意愿；但意愿所吸收之物却会进入理解力。因为凡人所意愿的，他都会思考。因此，当他的欲望引领他意愿邪恶时，他也会思想并确认它。当邪恶的思维变成对它的确认时，这些确认就是被称为由恶欲的生命所产生的虚假。这些虚假被此人视为真理；并且一旦他确认这些虚假，真理就被他视为虚假；因为这时，他关闭了经由天堂从主而来的光之流注。但是，如果他还没有确认这些虚假，那么之前由他的理解力所吸收的真理就会抵挡它们，防止它们被确认。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4729</b></p><p><b>4729.</b>
And we will say, An evil wild beast hath devoured him. That this signifies a lie from a life of cupidities, is evident from the signification of a "wild beast," as being affection and cupidity (n. 45, 
46); for a "wild beast" in the genuine sense denotes what is living (n. 774, 841, 908); hence by an "evil wild beast" is here signified a life of cupidities; that it is a lie is plain. This has reference 
to what goes before-that their rejecting that Divine truth among falsities, was a lie from a life of cupidities. For there are three sources of falsity, one the doctrine of the church, another the 
fallacy of the senses, and the third a life of cupidities. That which is from the doctrine of the church takes hold of man's intellectual part only; for he is persuaded from infancy that it is so, 
and confirmatory things afterwards strengthen it. But that which is from the fallacy of the senses does not so much affect the intellectual part; for those who are in falsity from the fallacy of the senses 
have but little insight from the understanding, because they think from lower and sensuous things. But the falsity which is from a life of cupidities springs from the will itself, or what is the 
same, from the heart; for what man wills from the heart, he desires. This falsity is the worst of all, because it inheres, and is not eradicated except by new life from the Lord. [2] There are, as is 
known, two interior faculties in man, the understanding and the will. What the understanding absorbs and becomes imbued with, does not for this reason pass into the will; but what the will absorbs does 
pass into the understanding. For whatever a man wills, he thinks; and therefore when he wills evil from cupidity, he thinks it and confirms it. The confirmations of evil by the thought are what are 
called falsities from a life of cupidities. These falsities appear to him as truths; and when he has confirmed them in himself, truths appear to him as falsities; for he has then shut out the influx 
of light through heaven from the Lord. But if he has not confirmed these falsities in himself, then the truths with which his understanding had previously been imbued, resist and do not permit them to 
be confirmed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4729</b></p><p><b>4729.</b>
'And let us say, An evil wild animal has devoured him' means a lie invented out of a life of evil desires. This is clear from the meaning of 'a wild animal' as affection or else evil desire, dealt with 
in <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, for in the genuine sense 'a wild animal' means that which is living, <a href="774.htm">774</a>, <a href="841.htm">841</a>, <a href="908.htm">908</a>, and therefore 'an evil wild animal' here means a life of evil desires. The fact that a lie is meant is 
self-evident; and this lie is connected with what has come immediately before about them casting that Divine truth away among falsities- a lie invented out of a life of evil desires. For falsity arises 
from three different sources, the first being the teaching of the Church, the second the illusions of the senses, and the third the life of evil desires. Falsity arising from the teaching of the Church 
occupies solely the understanding part of a person's mind, for he has been convinced since early childhood that such falsity is the truth, confirmations coming in by and by to strengthen that conviction. 
But falsity arising from the illusions of the senses has less impact on the understanding part, for people who are under the influence of falsity arising from the illusions of the senses receive 
little insight from their understanding because their thinking is founded on base ideas and on sensory impressions. Falsity arising from a life of evil desires however springs from the will itself, 
or what amounts to the same, from the heart, for a person desires that which he wills from the heart. This is the worst kind of falsity because it clings and is not rooted out except by means of a new 
life received from the Lord. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 As is well known, man has two inner mental powers - the understanding and the will. That which the understanding takes in and absorbs does not therefore pass over 
into the will, but that which the will takes in and absorbs does pass over into the understanding; for what is in a person's will occupies his thought also. Consequently when his desires lead him to 
will what is evil he is also thinking about it and confirming it. And when thoughts of evil have become confirmations of it they are called falsities arising from a life of evil desires. These falsities 
are seen by that person as truths, and once he has confirmed those falsities, truths are then seen by him as falsities, for he has now blocked off the light that flows from the Lord through heaven. 
But if he has not confirmed those falsities, truths which have been previously absorbed by his understanding stand in the way and prevent those falsities from being confirmed. </p>

`Et dicamus, Fera mala comedit eum': quod significet mendacium ex vita cupiditatum, constat e significatione `ferae' quod sit affectio et cupiditas, de qua n. 45, 46; `fera' enim in genuino sensu 
est vivum, n. 774, 841, 908, inde per `feram malam' hic significatur vita cupiditatum; quod sit mendacium, patet; hoc refert se ad antecedentia, nempe quod Divinum illud verum rejecerint inter falsa; 
fuerit mendacium ex vita cupiditatum; sunt enim tres origines falsi, una ex doctrina Ecclesiae, altera ex fallacia sensuum, tertia ex vita cupiditatum; quod ex doctrina (o)Ecclesiae, hoc solum 
intellectualem partem hominis captat, nam persuadetur ab infantia quod ita sit, et confirmantia dein corroborant illud; quod autem ex fallacia sensuum, hoc non ita intellectualem partem afficit, est 
enim illis qui in falso sunt ex fallacia sensuum, parum intuitionis ex intellectu, ex inferioribus enim et sensualibus cogitant; at falsum ex vita cupiditatum scaturit ex ipsa voluntate, seu quod 
idem, ex corde, nam quod vult ex corde homo, hoc cupit, id falsum pessimum est quia inhaeret et non eradicatur nisi per novam vitam a Domino: [2] sunt, ut notum (o)est, binae facultates interiores 
hominis, nempe intellectus et voluntas; quod intellectus haurit et imbuit, hoc non ideo transit in voluntatem, at quod voluntas, hoc transit in intellectum, nam quod vult homo, hoc cogitat, quapropter 
cum vult malum ex cupiditate, tunc cogitat id et confirmat; confirmantia mali per cogitationem sunt quae vocantur falsa ex vita cupiditatum; {1} haec falsa apparent illi sicut vera et cum confirmaverat 
apud se illa falsa, tunc apparent ei vera sicut falsa, nam tunc praecluserat influxum luci per caelum a Domino; at vero si non confirmaverat apud se illa falsa, tunc obstant vera quae prius 
(t)ejus intellectus imbuerat, et non permittunt ut confirmentur.      @1 i et$ </p>
