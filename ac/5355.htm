<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5355节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5355.</strong>“因为神使我多结果实”表随之源于良善的真理的增多。这从“多结果实”的含义清楚可知，“多结果实”是指增多，即源于良善的真理的增多；因为“结果实”论及良善，“增多”论及真理（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>，<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="2847.htm">2847</a>节）。在原文，“以法莲”这个名字源于表示结果实的一个词，其性质就包含在这句话里：“神使我在受苦之地多结果实”。该性质就是，在那里所遭受的试探结束后，源于良善的真理在属世层里面增多。不过，必须简要描述一下何为源于良善的真理的增多。当人处于良善，也就是对邻之爱时，他也处于对真理的爱。故他越处于这良善，就越拥有对真理的情感，因为良善存在于真理里面，犹如灵魂存在于它的身体里面。<br />因此，良善使真理增多的程度，就是它自我繁殖的程度；它若是真仁爱的良善，就会在真理里面并通过真理无穷无尽地自我繁殖。因为良善或真理是没有限制的。这种无限就存在于真理或良善的每一个形式里面，因为每一个形式都来源于这无限。然而，这种无穷无尽的品质永远无法与无限本身相提并论，因为有限与无限之间没有任何比率关系。今日的教会几乎没有任何真理的增多，原因在于：如今纯正仁爱的良善是不存在的。教会以为人只要简单地知道他出生所在的教会的信条，并以各种方式坚定赞同它们就足够了。但是，凡处于真仁爱的良善，并由此处于对真理的情感之人都不会同意这一点，而是渴望从圣言得到启示，澄清何为真理，并在坚定赞同这真理之前先明白它。此外，他凭良善明白真理，事实上，对真理的觉知源于良善；因为主就在那良善里面，并赐予觉知。当人以这种方式从主接受真理时，他就会使这真理无限增多。这好比一粒小种子长成一棵大树，结出更多小种子；这些小种子反过来又长成花园，等等。</p>

For God hath made me fruitful. That this signifies the consequent multiplication of truth from good, is evident from the signification of "making fruitful," as being multiplication, namely, of truth 
from good; for "fruitfulness" is predicated of good, and "multiplication" of truth (n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 1940, 2846, 2847). Hence in the original language "Ephraim" was named from fruitfulness, and his 
quality is contained in the words, "for God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction." This quality is that truth from good was multiplied in the natural after the temptations suffered there. 
What the multiplication of truth from good is shall be briefly stated. When man is in good, that is, in love toward the neighbor, he is also in the love of truth; consequently insofar as he is in 
this good, so far he is affected by truth, for good is in truth as the soul in its body. As therefore good multiplies truth, so it propagates itself; and if it is the good of genuine charity, it propagates 
itself in truth and by truth indefinitely; for there is no limit to good or to truth. The Infinite is in all things in general and in particular, because they are all from the Infinite; but still 
the indefinite can never in any way reach the Infinite, because there is no ratio between the finite and the Infinite. In the church today there is rarely any multiplication of truth, for the reason 
that at this day there is no good of genuine charity. It is believed to be sufficient to know the dogmas of faith of the church in which the man is born, and to confirm them by various means. But one 
who is in the good of genuine charity, and thence in the affection of truth, is not content with this, but desires to be enlightened from the Word as to what truth is, and to see the truth before he 
confirms it. Moreover, he sees it from good, because the perception of truth is from good; for the Lord is in good, and gives the perception. When a man receives truth in this way, it increases indefinitely. 
In this respect it is like a little seed, which grows into a tree, and produces other little seeds, which in turn produce a garden, and so on. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5355</b></p><p><b>5355.</b>
'For God has made me fruitful' means leading to a multiplication of truth from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'making fruitful' as a multiplication, that is to say, of truth from good, for fruitfulness 
is used in reference to good and multiplication to truth, <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>, <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="2847.htm">2847</a>. In the original language the name Ephraim is derived from a word meaning fruitfulness, the essential 
nature of which is contained in the statement 'for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction'. That essential nature is one in which truth from good in the natural has been multiplied 
after the temptations undergone there have come to an end. But a brief description of what a multiplication of truth from good is must be given. When good, that is, love towards the neighbour, is present 
in a person, so also is the love of truth. Consequently, insofar as that good is present he feels an affection for truth, since good exists within truth like the soul within its body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In 
the measure therefore that good multiplies truth it reproduces itself; and if it is the good of genuine charity it reproduces itself endlessly within truth and through truth. For there is no limit either 
to good or to truth; the Infinite is present within every single form of truth or good because each one has its origin in the Infinite. Yet that endless quality cannot ever match up to the Infinite 
itself, for what is limited or finite cannot be compared with the Infinite. In the Church at the present day scarcely any multiplication of truth takes place. The reason for this is that at the present 
day the good of genuine charity is non-existent. The Church believes that it is enough if a person knows simply the tenets of the Church within which he is born and in various ways firmly assents 
to these. But one with whom the good of genuine charity exists and who consequently feels an affection for truth is not content with that but wishes to clarify from the Word what the truth is and to 
see it before firmly assenting to it. Also, it is good that enables him to see it, for the discernment of truth originates in good, the Lord being within that good and imparting such discernment. When 
the person receives truth from Him he increases it to an unlimited extent. This may be likened to a tiny seed which grows into a tree and produces more tiny seeds, which then grow into a garden, and 
so on beyond that. </p>

`Quia fructificari fecit me Deus': quod significet inde multiplicationem veri ex bono, constat ex significatione `fructificari facere' quod sit multiplicatio, nempe veri ex bono, fructificatio enim 
praedicatur ex bono, et multiplicatio de vero, n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 1940, 2846, 2847; Ephraim inde in lingua originali nominatus est a fructificatione, cujus quale continetur in (t)his verbis `quia fructificari 
fecit me Deus in terra afflictionis meae'; quale est quod multiplicatum sit verum ex bono in naturali post tentationes quas ibi passus. Quid multiplicatio veri a bono, paucis dicendum: cum 
homo in bono est, hoc est, in amore erga proximum, tunc etiam in amore veri est, inde quantum in bono illo est, tantum vero afficitur, nam bonum {1}est in vero sicut anima in suo corpore; [2] {2}sicut 
itaque bonum multiplicat verum, ita se propagat, sique genuinae charitatis bonum est, propagat se in vero {3}et per verum in indefinitum, nam non datur finis neque bono neque vero, {4}Infinitum est in 
omnibus et singulis, quia omnia et singula ex Infinito sunt; at usque indefinitum {5}illud nusquam aliquo modo pertingere ad Infinitum potest, quia ratio {6}finiti nulla datur cum Infinito; in Ecclesia 
hodie raro datur multiplicatio veri; causa est quia hodie non est bonum genuinae charitatis; creditur satis esse scire dogmata fidei quae sunt Ecclesiae in qua natus est, et illa variis confirmare; 
at qui in bono genuinae charitatis est et inde in affectione veri, {7} non contentus est eo, sed vult illustrari ex Verbo quid verum, et videre illud priusquam confirmat; videt etiam ex bono, nam apperceptio 
veri est ex bono, Dominus enim est in bono et dat apperceptionem; cum inde accipit verum, tunc crescit id in {8}indefinitum; {9} se habet hoc sicut seminulum quod crescit in arborem, et producit 
seminula, et haec dein hortum, et sic porro. @1 se format in vero, et ibi est$ @2 tunc bonum sicut$ @3 immensum$ @4 indefinitum$ @5 hoc$ @6 non datur aliqua alicujus$ @7 i is$ @8 immensum$ @9 
i nam sicut verum multiplicatur ita extendit se bonum, et sicut extendit se bonum, ita multiplicat verum, bonum enim ad infinitum vult,$ </p>
