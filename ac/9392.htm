Verses 6-8. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it into basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. And he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the ears of the people; and 
they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do and hear. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah hath made with you upon 
all these words. "And Moses took half of the blood," signifies Divine truth that has been made of the life and of worship; "and put it into basins," signifies with man in the things of his memory; "and 
half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar," signifies Divine truth from the Divine Human of the Lord; "and he took the book of the covenant," signifies the Word in the letter with which the Word in 
heaven has been conjoined; "and read it in the ears of the people," signifies for hearkening and obedience; "and they said, All things that Jehovah hath spoken we will do and hear," signifies the reception 
of the truth that proceeds from the Divine Human of the Lord, and obedience from the heart and soul; "and Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people," signifies adaptation to the reception 
of man; "and said, Behold the blood of the covenant," signifies thereby the conjunction of the Lord in respect to the Divine Human with heaven and with earth; "that Jehovah hath made with you upon 
all these words," signifies that there is conjunction with the Lord through each and all things of the Word. </p>

Verses 6-8 And Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and half of the blood he sprinkled over the altar. And he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the ears of the people; and they 
said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do and hear. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it over the people, and said, Behold, the blood of the covenant which Jehovah has made with you according 
to all these words. 'And Moses took half of the blood' means Divine Truth which has become a matter of life and of worship.  </p>
<p>'And put it in bowls' means present with a person, in the things forming 
his memory. 'And half of the blood he sprinkled over the altar' means Divine Truth from the Lord's Divine Human. 'And he took the book of the covenant' means the Word in the letter to which the Word 
in heaven was joined. 'And read it in the ears of the people' means to be listened to and obeyed. 'And they said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do and hear' means receiving the truth that emanates 
from the Lord's Divine Human, and obeying it with heart and soul. 'And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it over the people' means making a person well-adapted to receive it. 'And said, Behold, 
the blood of the covenant' means that by means of this truth the Lord's Divine Human is joined to heaven and to earth. 'Which Jehovah has made with you according to all these words' means that the 
Lord accomplishes the joining together by means of every single part of the Word.  </p>

Vers.  6-8.  Et accepit Moscheh dimidium sanguinis, et posuit in crateribus, et dimidium sanguinis sparsit super altare.  Et accepit librum foederis, et legit in auribus populi, et dixerunt, Omnia quae 
locutus Jehovah faciemus et audiemus. Et accepit Moscheh sanguinem et sparsit super populum, et dixit, Ecce sanguis foederis quod pepigit Jehovah cum vobis super omnia verba haec.  `Et accepit Moscheh 
dimidium sanguinis' significat Divinum Verum quod factum vitae et cultus: `et posuit in crateribus' significat apud hominem in ejus memoriae rebus: `et dimidium sanguinis sparsit super altare' significat 
Divinum Verum a Domini Divino Humano: `et accepit librum foederis' significat Verbum in littera cum quo conjunctum est Verbum in caelo: `et legit in auribus populi' significat ad auscultationem 
et oboedientiam: `et dixerunt, Omnia quae locutus Jehovah faciemus et audiemus' significat receptionem veri procedentis a Divino Humano Domini et oboedientiam ex corde et anima: `et accepit Moscheh 
sanguinem et sparsit super populum' significat adaptationem ad recipiendum ab homine: `et dixit, Ecce sanguis foederis' significat per id conjunctionem Domini quoad Divinum Humanum cum caelo et cum terra: 
`quod pepigit Jehovah cum vobis super omnia verba haec' significat quod conjunctio {1}a Domino per omnia et singula Verbi. @1 cum IT$ </p>
