<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5124节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5124.</strong>“法老必使你抬起头来”表已经预备并因此决定的事。这从“抬起头”的含义清楚可知，“抬起头来”是指作出决定，在至高意义上是指预备，因为神性所作的决定，以及这个决定的生效就是神的旨意。“抬起头来”是古人当中当被囚的，或在监狱里的人或被判为生，或被判为死时，宣判的惯用表达形式。当被判为生时，就用“抬起头来”这种说法，如列王纪下：<br />巴比伦王以未米罗达作王那一年，使犹大王约雅斤抬起头来，出了监狱，对他说好话，使他的宝座高过与他一同在巴比伦众王的宝座。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下25.27.htm">25:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下25.28.htm">28</a>）<br />在耶利米书也是：<br />巴比伦王以未米罗达登基的元年，使犹大王约雅斤抬头，提他出了监狱。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶52.31.htm">52:31</a>）<br />但当他们被判为死时，就用“将头提起离开他身上”这个说法，如下文论及膳长的话：<br />三天之内，法老必将你的头提起离开你身上。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创40.19.htm">40:19</a>）<br />判决生死的这种形式起源于古人，代表存在于他们当中；它起源于那些被囚在监狱，或坑里之人的代表。由于在监里的人代表在低地之下经历消磨的人（<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>，<a href="4744.htm">4744</a>，<a href="5038.htm">5038</a>节），所以“抬起头来”表示他们从这种状况中释放出来。事实上，当得到释放时，他们就从消磨当中被提升或带上来，进入天堂社群（<a href="2699.htm">2699</a>，<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="2704.htm">2704</a>节）。“被提升”或“被带上来”就是朝向内层事物发展，因为被提升或高论及这些内层事物（<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>节）。由于所指的是朝向内层事物的发展，故所指的是朝向天堂的发展，天堂就存在于内层事物中。这就是“抬起头来”的含义。但“将头提起离开某人”表示判他死刑，因为在这种情况下，在那些在坑里或经历消磨的人之上的人被提入天堂，而坑里的人则下到阴间。由于这种含义，故在圣言中，经上也用这种宣判的形式。由此明显可知，“抬起头来”表示已决定的事，在至高意义上表示已预备的事，因为神性预备祂已作出决定的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5124</b></p><p><b>5124.</b>
Shall Pharaoh lift up thy head. That this signifies what is provided, and therefore what is concluded, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the head," as being to conclude, and in the supreme 
sense to provide; for the Divine conclusion, and execution of a thing concluded, is providence. "To lift up the head" was a customary form of passing sentence among the ancients, when the bound, 
or those in prison were adjudged either to life or to death; when to life, this was expressed by "lifting up the head," as in the second book of Kings: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that 
he was made king, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of the prison house, and spake good to him, and set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon (2 
Kings 25:27-28).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>	&nbsp;So in Jeremiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of the prison house (Jer. 
52:31). But when they were adjudged to death, it was expressed by "lifting up the head from off him," as in what follows concerning the baker: "In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from 
off thee" (verse 19).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>	[2] This form of sentence had its origin among the ancients who were in representatives, from the representation of those who were bound in prison or in a pit; and as by these 
were represented those who were in vastation under the lower earth (n. 4728, 4744, 5038), therefore by "lifting up their head" was signified their liberation, for they are then elevated or lifted up out 
of vastation to the heavenly societies (n. 2699, 2701, 2704). "To be lifted up" or "to be elevated" is to advance toward the interior things; for what is elevated or high is predicated of these (n. 
2148, 4210); and because it is toward interior things it is toward heaven, for heaven is in the interior things. This was signified by "lifting up the head." But by "lifting the head from off" anyone 
was signified to adjudge him to death, because then those who were above those in the pit, or in vastation, were elevated to heaven, while the others were let down to lower depths. Because of this signification, 
therefore, this form of sentence was received in the Word. It is hence plain that by "lifting up the head" is signified what is concluded; and because what is concluded is signified, in the 
supreme sense is signified what is provided; for what the Divine concludes, this it provides. </p>

'Pharaoh will lift up your head' means that which has been provided and therefore decided. This is clear from the meaning of 'lifting up the head' as reaching a decision, and in the highest sense as 
providing; for a decision taken by the Divine and the carrying of that decision into effect is Providence. 'Lifting up the head' was an expression commonly used by the Ancients when it was decided that 
those who were bound, that is, those in prison, should either be allowed to live or else be condemned to death. When they were allowed to live the expression 'lifting up the head' was used, as also 
in the second Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Evil-merodach king of Babel, in the year he became king, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah from the prison-house; and he spoke to him that which was good, 
and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babel. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 25:17, <a href="28.htm">28</a>. </p>
<p>Similarly in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Evil-merodach king of Babel, in the [first] year of his reign, lifted up the 
head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him from the prison-house. Jer. 52:31. </p>
<p>But when someone was condemned to death the expression 'lifting up the head from upon him' was used, as in verse 19 further on which refers to the baker, </p>
<p>In yet three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from upon you. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This phrase expressing the decision that someone should live or be put to death originated 
with the Ancients, among whom representatives existed; it originated in their representation of those who were bound in prison or the pit. Because those in prison represented people undergoing 
vastation beneath the lower earth, <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>, <a href="4744.htm">4744</a>, <a href="5038.htm">5038</a>, lifting up the head' therefore meant their release from this condition. For when they are released they are raised or brought up from that vastation 
to heavenly communities, see <a href="2699.htm">2699</a>, <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="2704.htm">2704</a>. Being brought or raised up implies advances made towards interior things, for the expression raised up or high is used to refer to things that are interior, 
<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>. And because advances made towards interior things are meant, an advance towards heaven is meant, since heaven exists within interior things. Such is the meaning of 'lifting up the head'. 
But 'lifting up the head from upon someone' meant his condemnation to death, for in this case those who were above the ones in the pit or undergoing vastation were raised up to heaven, while those 
in the pit were sent down into the nether regions. These things meant by this phrase expressing the decision whether one should live or be put to death are the reason for its usage in the Word. From 
this it is evident that 'lifting up the head' means that which has been decided; and as this is meant, that which has been provided is meant in the highest sense, since the Divine makes provision for 
that on which He has made a decision. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5124</b>
</p><b>5124.</b>
` Extollat Pharaoh caput tuum':  quod significet provisum et inde conclusum, constat ex significatione `extollere caput' quod sit concludere, et in supremo sensu providere, Divina enim conclusio 
et rei conclusae executio est Providentia. `Extollere caput' fuit formula sollemnis judicii apud antiquos, cum vincti seu qui in carcere, judicabantur vel ad vitam vel ad mortem; cum ad vitam, dicebatur 
`extollere caput', ut quoque in Libro 2 Regum,      Extulit Evilmerodachus rex Babelis, anno quo rex factus, caput      Jehoiachini regis Jehudae, e domo carceris, et locutus cum eo      bonum, 
et dedit thronum ejus supra thronum regum qui cum illo      in Babele, xxv 27, 28: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>similiter apud Jeremiam,      Extulit Evilmerodachus rex Babelis in {1}anno regni sui caput      Jehoiachini regis 
Jehudae, et eduxit eum e domo carceris, lii      31; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>cum autem judicarentur ad mortem, dicebatur `extollere caput e super illum', ut in sequentibus de pistore, `In adhuc tribus diebus extollat 
Pharaoh caput tuum {2}e super te', vers. 19.  </p>
<p>[2] Illa judicii formula traxerat originem apud antiquos qui in repraesentativis fuerunt, a repraesentatione illorum qui vincti in carcere seu {3} fovea 
fuerunt, per quos quia repraesentabantur illi qui in vastatione sub terra inferiore sunt, n. 4728, 4744, 5038, ideo per `extollere caput' significabatur eorum liberatio; </p>
<p>elevantur enim tunc {4}seu 
{5}attolluntur {6}e vastatione ad societates caelestes, videatur n. 2699, 2701, 2704; attolli seu elevari est progredi versus interiora, nam elevatum seu altum praedicatur de interioribus, n. 2148, 
4210, et quia versus interiora, est versus caelum, nam caelum est in interioribus; hoc significabatur per `attollere caput'; at per `attollere caput e super aliquem' significabatur judicari ad 
mortem, quia tunc illi qui supra illos in fovea seu vastatione, elevabantur ad caelum, iis ad inferiora demissis; {7}haec formula judicii, quia haec per illam significata sunt, ideo recepta est in 
Verbo. Quod per `{8}attollere caput' significetur conclusum, inde patet; et quia conclusum, in supremo sensu significatur provisum, quod enim Divinum concludit, hoc providet. @1 So Heb, but preceding 
quotation shows that primo anno is understood.$ @2 a I$ @3 i in$ @4 et$ @5 Alters extolluntur to attolluntur$ @6 e fovea seu carcere illo$ @7 quia haec significata sunt per hanc formulam apud 
antiquos$ @8 extollere$ </p>
