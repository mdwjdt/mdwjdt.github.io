<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1981节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1981.</strong>我再举一个类似例子。我曾做到一个很普通的梦，醒来后，我便将它从头至尾讲述了一遍。天使们说，这与他们的讨论完全一致；并不是他们正在讨论的事物出现在梦中，相反，梦中所见的是完全不同的事物，天使讨论中的想法就转变为这些事物，不过却是以这样的方式，即它们具有代表性和对应性，并且一个细节也没遗漏。我还与他们谈了流注的问题，以及这类事物如何流入并发生变化。有一个人，我认为他受属世真理支配，我的这个想法是从他的生活行为中得来的。天使们正进行一场有关属世真理的讨论，为此，那人被呈现给我。他在我梦中所说所做的事，以及这些事到来所依照的次序都是其更高源头，也就是天使之间所进行的讨论的代表物，并与这讨论相对应。然而，他所告诉我的，却和天使们正在讨论的不一样。</p>

I may relate one more instance of a similar kind. I dreamed a dream, but a common one. When I awoke, I related it all from beginning to end. The angels said that it coincided exactly with what they had 
spoken of together; not that the things seen in the dream were the same, for they were wholly different, being things into which the thoughts of their conversation were turned, but in such a way that 
they were representative and correspondent; and this in every particular, so that nothing was wanting. I then spoke with them about influx, as to how such things flow in and are varied. There was a 
person of whom I had the idea that he was in natural truth, which idea I had gathered from the acts of his life. There was a conversation among the angels about natural truth, and on this account that 
person was represented to me; and the things he said to me, and did, in my dream, followed in order representatively and correspondently from the discourse of the angels with one another. But still 
there was nothing precisely alike, or the same. </p>

Let one further similar experience be related. I once had quite an ordinary dream, and having woken up I related it all from start to finish. The angels said that it coincided exactly with what they 
had been discussing; not that the things they were discussing appeared in the dream, but instead things completely different, into which the thoughts in their discussion were transformed, yet in such 
a way that they were representative and correspondent. Not one detail was missing. I also spoke to them about influx, about how such things flow in and are varied. There was a person of whom I had the 
idea that he was governed by natural truth, an idea which I had gained from the things he had done in life. Among the angels a discussion was taking place concerning natural truth, and therefore that 
person was represented to me. What he told me in my dream, and the things that he did, as well as the order in which these things came, were representative of and corresponded to their higher source, 
namely the discussion taking place among the angels. Yet what he told me was not anything like or the same as what the angels were discussing. </p>

</p><b>1981.</b>
Unum simile licet adhuc referre; somniavi somnium sed vulgare; dum vigil factus, narravi omnia a principio ad finem; angeli dicebant quod prorsus coinciderent cum illis quae inter se locuti, non quod 
essent illa quae somnio sed prorsus illa, in quae versa sunt eorum loquelae cogitata, sic tamen ut essent repraesentativa et correspondentia, immo singula ut nihil deesset: tum locutus cum illis de 
influxu, quomodo talia influunt et variantur; et persona de qua illam ideam habui quod esset in vero naturali, quam ideam cepi ex ejus vitae actis; apud angelos fuit loquela de veritate naturali, quare 
ille repraesentabatur mihi, et quae is loquebatur mecum in somnio et agebat, haec ordine repraesentative et correspondenter sequebantur ex eorum sermone mutuo; sed usque nihil erat quod prorsus simile 
seu idem fuit. </p>
