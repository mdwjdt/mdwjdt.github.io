<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2577节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2577.</strong>“并众人”表由此衍生的真理，即记忆真理和感官真理也是如此。这从前面所述和整个思路清楚可知。因为经上刚才说“看哪，这要给你在与你一起的所有人面前作遮眼的”，这句话是指理性真理，理性真理对属灵真理来说，就像幔子；现在经上又说“并众人”，这句话是指源于理性真理的更为低级的真理；这些真理正是所谓的记忆真理和感官真理。这些真理源于理性真理，这一事实从流注的次序明显可知：即内在事物流入外在事物，或也可说，高级事物流入低级事物，反过来不行。事实上，表面上看，次序似乎不是这样，也就是说，人似乎通过感官印象和记忆知识而变得理性，但这是一个错觉。主的良善不断经由人类理性能力流入进来，在记忆中与知识相遇，并将这些知识融入到自己里面。这良善越将它们融入到自己里面，并按适当秩序排列它们，人就越变得理性。被称为信之良善与真理的良善与真理也一样。主的良善流入真理，并将这些真理融入到自己里面。这良善越能将这些真理融入到自己里面，人就越变得属灵。然而，表面上看，似乎是这些所谓的信之真理流入进来，并使他变得属灵。正是由于这种表象，如今人们才过分推崇关乎信的真理，而不去思考关乎仁的良善。</p>

And with all. That this signifies that so also are the derivative truths, namely, those of memory and of the senses, is evident from what has been said above, and from the series itself; for it is said 
just above, "behold it shall be unto thee a veiling of the eyes unto all who are with thee;" by which are signified rational truths, which are like a veil to spiritual truths; and it is now said again, 
"with all;" by which are therefore signified still lower truths which are derived from rational truths; these being no other than what are called memory truths and sensuous truths. That these truths 
are derived from rational truths is evident from the order of influx. Interior things flow into exterior things; or what is the same, higher things into lower; but not the reverse. It indeed appears 
otherwise, namely, that man becomes rational by means of the things of sense and of memory, but this is a fallacy. Good from the Lord is constantly flowing in through man's rational faculty, and it 
meets and adopts to itself the knowledges in the memory; and insofar as it can do this, and dispose them in due order, so far the man becomes rational. The case herein is the same as with the good and 
truths which are called those of faith: good from the Lord flows into truths, and adopts them, and insofar as it can do this the man becomes spiritual; although it appears as if truths, called the truths 
of faith, flow in, and render the man spiritual. It is also owing to this appearance that the truth of faith is so much cultivated at this day, while the good of charity is not thought of. </p>

'And with all' means that so also are the truths descending from these, namely factual truths and sensory truths. This is clear from what has been stated above and from the actual train of thought, for 
it is said just above, 'Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes for all who are with you', by which rational truths are meant, which are like a covering to spiritual truths. And now 'all' occurs 
a second time, which therefore means lower truths still which are derived from rational truths. These lower truths are none other than those which are called factual truths and sensory truths. That 
these are derived and descend from rational truths is clear from the order which governs influx - interior things flow into exterior, or what amounts to the same, higher flow into lower, but not vice 
versa. The order does indeed seem to be other than this, that is to say, man seems to be made rational by means of sensory impressions and factual knowledge, but this is an illusion. Good from the Lord 
is flowing in all the time through man's rational faculty, where it meets facts and takes these into itself. And to the extent it is able to take them into itself and arrange them into a proper order, 
that person is made rational. It is similar with the good and the truths which are called the good and the truths of faith. Good from the Lord flows into the truths and takes these into itself; and 
to the extent it is able to take these into itself, that person is made spiritual. The appearance however is that it is these so-called truths of faith which flow. in and make him spiritual. This appearance 
is also the reason why nowadays people venerate truth which is a matter of faith and give no thought to good which is a matter of charity. </p>

</p><b>2577.</b>
`Et cum omnibus': quod significet quod et vera quae inde, nempe scientifica et sensualia, constat ab illis quae supra dicta sunt, atque ipsa serie, dicitur enim mox supra `ecce illud tibi velamen oculorum 
omnibus qui tecum,' per quae significantur vera rationalia quae instar velaminis veris spiritualibus sunt, et nunc iterum dicitur `cum omnibus,' quibus ideo significantur vera adhuc inferiora quae 
sunt ex rationalibus; haec non alia sunt quam quae vocantur vera scientifica, et vera sensualia; quod ex rationalibus sint vera scientifica et vera sensualia, constat ex ordine influxus, interiora 
influunt in exteriora, seu quod idem, superiora in inferiora, non autem vicissim; apparet quidem apparet, nempe quod per sensualia et scientifica non rationalis fiat, sed hoc est fallacia; bonum a Domino 
per facultatem rationalem hominis jugiter influit et occurrit, et sibi adoptat scientifica, et quantum eorum sibi adoptare potest, et rite disponere, tantum rationalis fit: hoc similiter se habet 
ac cum bono et veris quae dicuntur fidei; bonum a Domino influit in vera, et ea sibi adoptat, et quantum eorum sibi adoptare potest, tantum spiritualis fit homo; tametsi apparet sicut vera quae dicuntur 
{1} fidei, influant, et hominem spiritualem reddant: apparentia haec etiam est causa quod tantum hodie colatur verum quod est fidei, et non cogitetur de bono quod est charitatis. 	@1 vocantur.$ </p>
