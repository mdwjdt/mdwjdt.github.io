<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第419节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>419.</strong>由于属天之物是爱的神圣事物及其衍生的良善，所以属灵事物就是信的真理与良善；因为真正的信，不但理解什么是真，而且还理解什么是善。信的知识包含这二者。但象信教导这样的就是属天的。竖琴是人们熟知的一种弦乐器，因此表属灵的真理；而风琴在弦乐器与管乐器之间，故而表属灵的良善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]419.</strong> Just as holy love and the good actions that it gives rise to are heavenly things, the true ideas of faith and the good actions that faith gives rise to are spiritual things. The function of faith, after all, is to understand not only what is true but also what is good; religious knowledge involves both. But to be the kind of person that faith teaches us to be is a heavenly thing.<br />As faith involves both truth and goodness, they are symbolized by the two instruments — harp and organ. A harp is a stringed instrument, as everyone knows, so it symbolizes spiritual truth. An organ, though, is midway between a stringed and a wind instrument, so it symbolizes spiritual good. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 419</b></p><p><b>419.</b>
As celestial things are the holy things of love and the derivative goods, so spiritual things are the truths and goods of faith; for it belongs to faith to understand not only what is true, but also 
what is good. The knowledges of faith involve both. But to be such as faith teaches is celestial. As faith involves both of these, they are signified by two instruments, the harp and the organ. The harp, 
as everyone knows, is a stringed instrument, and therefore signifies spiritual truth; but the organ, being intermediate between a stringed instrument and a wind instrument, signifies spiritual good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 419</b></p><p><b>419.</b>
Just as celestial things are the holy things of love and the goods deriving from it, so spiritual things are the truths and goods of faith, for faith does indeed entail understanding not only what is 
true but also what is good. Cognitions of faith embrace them both; but being such as faith teaches is something celestial. Because faith embraces both, both are meant by the two instruments, the harp 
and the organ. The harp, as is well known, is a stringed instrument, and so means spiritual truth, while the organ, being an instrument midway between a stringed instrument and one that is blown, means 
spiritual good.  </p>

</p><b>419.</b>
Sicut caelestia sunt sancta amoris et bona inde, ita spiritualia sunt vera et bona fidei; fidei enim est intelligere non solum quid verum sed etiam quid bonum; cognitiones fidei involvunt utrumque; 
sed esse talis sicut fides docet, est caeleste. Quia fides involvit utrumque, significantur per duo instrumenta, per citharam et organum; cithara est instrumentum chordaceum, ut notum est, quare spirituale 
verum significat; organum autem est instrumentum medium inter chordaceum et quod inflatur; quare per id spirituale bonum significatur. </p>
