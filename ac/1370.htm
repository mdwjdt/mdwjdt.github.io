<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1370.</strong>要详细解释所表示的是这些事物，会占用太多篇幅，因为这不得不详述偶像崇拜的种类和衍生。对这些的认识只能借助它们的对立面，即亵渎，如对爱的属天、属灵事物的亵渎，由此而来的对理性的亵渎，以及最后对知识的亵渎。对这些事物的亵渎本身构成偶像崇拜的属和种。这并不包括偶像崇拜的形式，也就是外在的偶像崇拜，这种崇拜能与对善和真的情感结合起来，因而与仁爱结合起来，如过着相互仁爱生活的外邦人的情形。内在的偶像崇拜形式用外在的偶像崇拜形式来表示。出生、后代，以及他们的婚姻，就是邪恶与虚假的苟合，如27节和本节所描述的那些血亲关系和婚姻。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1370.</strong> Explaining why this is the symbolism would take too long, since the different kinds of idolatry and the ways they developed would have to be discussed in the process. The only way to recognize different kinds of idolatry is by their opposites. More precisely, the only way to recognize them is from the profanation of such things as the heavenly attributes and spiritual attributes of love; rational thoughts that spring from these attributes; and, lastly, facts.{*1} The ways in which each of these things is profaned are themselves the general categories and specific types of idolatry. The cults of various idols, which are external idolatries, are not categories of idolatry, however. These cults can be linked with affections for goodness and truth. So they can be linked with charity, as they are among nations that live lives of mutual kindness. Deeper forms of idolatrous worship are what the outwardly idolatrous cults in the Word symbolize.<br />The births and generations of these idolatries, and their marriages (which are marriages of evil and falsity), mirror exactly the relationships and marriages described in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1370/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_27" target=_top>27</a> and the current verse.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} It is not clear how the three types of profanation described here as leading to three types of idolatry relate to the three different categories of idolatry mentioned just above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1370/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1357" target=_top>1357</a>, or to the four kinds of idolatrous cults mentioned just above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1370/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1363" target=_top>1363:1</a>.

That these things are signified it would take too long to set forth; for it would involve a setting forth of the genera and derivations of idolatries. These cannot be known except from the opposite things, 
that is, from profanations, as of the celestial things of love, of the spiritual things of the same, and of the rational things therefrom, and lastly of memory-knowledges. The profanations themselves 
of these things constitute the genera and species of idolatries; but not the worships of idols, which are external idolatries, and which worships can be conjoined with affections of good and truth, 
and thus with charity, as takes place among Gentiles who live in mutual charity. It is interior idolatrous worships that are signified in the Word by the external idolatrous worships. The births, 
the generations, and also the marriages of them, which are those of evil and falsity, are circumstanced precisely as are these relationships and these marriages, which have been described in the 27th 
verse, and also in this one. </p>

That these things are meant would take too long to explain in detail, for one would have to give a detailed explanation of the kinds and derivatives of forms of idolatry. These cannot be known except 
from their opposites, that is, from the profanation of certain things, such as the profanation of the celestial things of love, and of the spiritual things of love, also of rational ideas deriving from 
these, and lastly of factual knowledge. These things when profaned constitute the genera and species of forms of idolatry. This does not include forms of idol worship, which are external forms of idolatry, 
and which are able to be joined to affections for what is good and true, and so to charity, as is the case with gentiles who lead charitable lives one with another. Interior forms of idolatrous 
worship are meant by the external forms of idolatrous worship in the Word. The births and generations, and also their marriages, which are marriages of evil and falsity, are exactly like those blood 
relationships and marriages described in verse 27 and in the present verse. </p>

</p><b>1370.</b>
Quod haec significentur, prolixum nimis foret exponere, sic enim exponerentur genera et derivationes idololatriarum; haec cognosci aliunde nequeunt quam ab oppositis, nempe a profanationibus ut caelestium 
amoris, spiritualium ejusdem, tum rationalium quae inde, demum scientificorum; ipsae profanationes illorum constituunt genera et species idololatriarum, non autem cultus idololatriarum qui sunt 
idololatriae externae, qui cultus conjuncti esse possunt cum affectionibus boni et veri et sic cum charitate, sicut apud gentes qua in charitate mutua vivunt; interiores cultus idololatrici sunt qui 
per idololatricos cultus externos significantur in Verbo: nativitates illorum et generationes, tum conjugia quae sunt mali et falsi, se prorsus habent secundum has propinquitates et secundum haec conjugia, 
quae in vers. 27 et in hoc descripta sunt. </p>
