<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>423.</strong>土八该隐被称为“一切匠人的师傅”，不像之前的雅八和犹八那样被称为“父”；原因在于，以前并不存在属天属灵、或内在之物。“父”这个词被用于雅八和犹八，是为了表示那时内在事物才开始存在；而属世或外在之物以前确实存在，不过现在被应用于内在事物，所以土八该隐没有被称为“父”，而被称为“一切匠人的师傅”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]423.</strong> Tubal-cain is described as one who trained every artisan rather than as a father, the way Jabal and Jubal were earlier. The heavenly and spiritual attributes, or deeper qualities, [of that new church] had not existed before, and since these first came into being at that time, Jabal and Jubal are called fathers. But the earthly attributes, or superficial ones, [of that church] had previously existed (although at this point they are connected with [those new] inner things), so he is called not the father but the trainer of an artisan. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 423</b></p><p><b>423.</b>
Tubal-Cain is called the "instructor of every artificer" and not the "father" as was the case with Jabal and Jubal; and the reason is that before there were no celestial and spiritual or internal things. 
And the term "father" is applied to Jabal and Jubal, to denote that such internal things then first began to exist; whereas natural or external things did exist before, but were now applied to internal 
things, so that Tubal-Cain is not called the "father" but the "instructor, of every artificer." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 423</b></p><p><b>423.</b>
Tubal-cain is called 'a teacher of every craftsman' but not 'a father' as Jabal and Jubal have been. The reason is that celestial and spiritual, or internal, things did not exist previously. Those two 
are called fathers because those things first existed at that point, whereas natural or external things did exist previously, though now allied to internal things. Therefore he is not called 'a father' 
but 'a teacher of craftsmen'.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 423</b>
</p><b>423.</b>
Tubal-cain dicitur 'erudiens omnem artificem,' non ut priores Jabal et Jubal, 'pater'; causa est quia caelestia et spiritualia, seu interna, non prius fuerunt; quare quia tunc primum, dicuntur patres; 
at naturalia seu externa prius fuerunt, sed nunc applicata internis; ideo non pater sed 'erudiens artificem' dicitur. </p>
