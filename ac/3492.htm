<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3492.</strong>“以撒老迈”表这状态即将到来之时。这从“变老”的含义清楚可知，“变老”是指新状态的到来和存在；因为在圣言中，“老迈”表示抛弃以前的状态，披上一个新的状态。它之所以具有这两层含义，是因为老年是生命的最后阶段，这时肉体之物连同前一阶段的爱开始被抛弃，因此内层之物开始被启示；因为一旦肉体之物被移除，内层之物就被启示。还因为天使以属灵的方式感知圣言中的事物，他们不再有任何老迈的概念，取而代之的是新生命的概念。因此，他们将以撒老迈理解为新状态即将到来，也就是说，以撒所代表的神圣理性渴望属世层与自己相对应，也就是属世层也要成为神性。</p>

And it came to pass that Isaac was old. That this signifies when the state was at hand, is evident from the signification of "growing old," as being the presence of a new state; for in the Word "old 
age" signifies both the putting off of a former state, and the putting on of a new one; and this for the reason that old age is the last of age, when corporeal things begin to be put off, and with them 
the loves of the preceding age, and thus when the interiors begin to be enlightened, for these are enlightened when corporeal things are removed; and also because the angels, who perceive in a spiritual 
manner the things that are in the Word, have no longer any idea of any old age, but instead of it an idea of new life, thus here an idea that the state was at hand, namely, that the Divine rational 
which is represented by Isaac desired a natural corresponding to itself, that is, one that would also be Divine. </p>

'So it was, that Isaac was old' means when the state was reached. This is clear from the meaning of 'growing old' as the arrival and presence of a new state; for 'old age' in the Word means both the 
casting aside of the previous state and the assumption of the new one. The reason it has these two meanings is that old age is the final stage of life, when bodily things start to be cast aside together 
with the loves which belong to the preceding stage, and so when interior things start to be enlightened; for once bodily things have been removed interior things are enlightened. And a further reason 
for the two meanings is that angels, who perceive spiritually the things that are in the Word, no longer have the concept of old age but instead the concept of new life. Thus by Isaac's being old they 
perceive that the state was reached, that is to say, when the Divine Rational, represented by Isaac, desired the Natural which corresponded to itself, that is, that the Natural too should be Divine. </p>

</p><b>3492.</b>
`Fuit quod senuit Jishak': quod significet cum status adesset, constat a significatione `senescere' quod sit novi status praesentia, `senectus' enim in Verbo significat et exuitionem status prioris 
et induitionem status novi, et {1}hoc ex causa quia senectus est ultimum aetatis, cum corporea incipiunt exui, et cum illis amores qui sunt aetatis quae praecessit, et sic cum illustrari incipiunt interiora, 
nam remotis illis, illustrantur haec; tum quoque quia angeli, qui spiritualiter illa quae in Verbo percipiunt, non amplius senectutis alicujus ideam habent, sed pro illa ideam vitae novae, ita 
hic quod status adesset, nempe quod Divinum Rationale, quod per `Jishakum' repraesentatur, desideraret Naturale sibi correspondens, hoc est, quod Divinum etiam esset. @1 quidem$  </p>
