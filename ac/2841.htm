<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2841节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2841.</strong>“耶和华的使者第二次从天上呼叫亚伯拉罕”表主（从神性所得）的更大安慰。这从“从天上呼叫”和“耶和华的使者”的含义清楚可知“从天上呼叫”是指给予安慰；“耶和华的使者”是指主的神性本身。如前所述（<a href="2821.htm">2821</a>节），那里有同样的话。经上之所以用“第二次”这个词，是因为主得到更大的安慰。第一次安慰出现在12至14节，那里论述的主题是主的规定。这安慰便是：人类中那些被称为属灵的人当被接纳。第二次更大的安慰则出现在接下来的几节（22:17，18等，直到本章末尾），而这个安慰则是：属灵之人必如同在天上的星和海边的沙那样繁多，并且不仅这些人会得救，凡具有良善的人都必得救。这些事就是主爱的对象，因此这类事给祂带来安慰。人只能从他所爱的事物中找到安慰。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2841</b></p><p><b>2841.</b>
The Angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven. That this signifies still greater consolation of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "calling out of heaven," as being 
to console; and from the signification of the "angel of Jehovah," as being the Lord's Divine Itself (see above, n. 2821, where the same words occur). This is said a "second time," because there is greater 
consolation. The first consolation is contained in verses 12, 13, and 14, where the subject is the Lord's providence that those from the human race who are called the spiritual should be adopted. 
The second consolation, which is greater, is contained in the verses that follow (17, 18, etc., to the end), namely, that the spiritual should be multiplied as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand 
upon the sea shore; and that not they only should be saved, but also all who are in good. These were things of the Lord's love, and therefore He had consolation from them. No one has consolation except 
from the things which are of his love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2841</b></p><p><b>2841.</b>
'The angel of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time out of heaven' means a still greater comfort received by the Lord [from the Divine]. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling out of heaven' as 
giving comfort to, and from the meaning of 'the angel of Jehovah' as the Lord's Divine itself, dealt with above in <a href="2821.htm">2821</a>, where the same words occur. The expression a second time is used here because 
a greater comfort is received. The comfort received first is contained in verses 12-14, where Divine providence is the subject, that comfort being that those members of the human race who are called spiritual 
would be adopted. The second comfort, which is greater, is contained in the verses which follow below - in verses 17, 18, and those that follow to the end of the chapter - the comfort in this 
case being that those spiritual ones would be multiplied as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the seashore, and that not only those people would be saved but also all in whom goodness may be 
found. These things were the objects of the Lord's love, and therefore such things brought Him comfort. No one finds any comfort except in the things which are the objects of his love. </p>

</p><b>2841.</b>
`Clamavit angelus Jehovae ad Abraham secundo e caelo':  quod significet consolationem Domini adhuc majorem, constat ex significatione `clamare e caelo' quod sit consolari, et ex significatione `angeli 
Jehovae' quod sit ipsum Divinum Domini, de quibus supra n. 2821, ubi eadem verba:  quod hic dicatur `secundo,' est quia major consolatio; prima consolatio continetur in vers. 12-14, ubi agitur de providentia 
Divina, quod illi ex humano genere qui spirituales dicuntur, adoptarentur; altera {1}consolatio, quae major, continetur in versibus qui sequuntur, 17, 18, seq. ad fin. nempe quod spirituales 
`multiplicarentur sicut stellae caelorum, et sicut arena super litore maris':  et quod salvarentur non solum illi, sed etiam omnes qui in bono sunt:  haec fuerunt amoris Domini; quare ex illis consolatio 
Ipsi; nulla consolatio alicui, nisi ex illis quae sunt amoris ejus. @1 after major$  </p>
