<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8505节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8505.</strong>“今天你们在田野必找不着了”表这时良善必不再通过真理获得。这从“找不着”和“田野”的含义清楚可知：“找不着”当论及通过真理所获得的良善时，是指不再获得；“田野”是指一个人，在此是指良善通过真理被植入其中之人的心智。事实上，一个人就被称为一块田地，因为他领受信之真理，也就是种子，产生种子的果实，也就是良善。<br />有必要简短阐述一下此中是何情形。重生之前，人出于真理行事；不过，通过真理获得良善；因为当真理变成其意愿、因而其生活的一部分时，它就在他那里变成良善。而重生之后，他出于良善行善，通过良善获得真理。说得更清楚一点：重生之前，人出于顺服行事；但重生之后，出于情感行事。这两种状态正好相反；因为在前一种状态，真理占主导地位；但在后一种状态，良善占主导地位；或说，在前一种状态，人向下或向后看；但在后一种状态，则向上或向前看。<br />当一个人达到后一种状态时，也就是当他出于情感行事时，就不再允许回头看，不再出于真理行良善；因为那时，主流入与他同在的良善，并通过这良善引导他。那时他若真的回头看，或出于真理行良善，就会出于他自己的东西行事；因为出于真理行事的人被自我引导，而出于良善行事的人被主引导。这就是主的这些话所表示的：<br />你们看见那行毁坏可憎的，在房顶上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.15.htm">24:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.18.htm">18</a>）<br />当那日，人在房上，器具在屋里，不要下来拿；人在田里，也不要转回他身后的事物。你们要回想罗得的妻子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.31.htm">17:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.32.htm">32</a>）<br />关于这些事的详情，可参看上下文的解释（<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="5895.htm">5895</a>e，<a href="5897.htm">5897</a>，<a href="7923.htm">7923</a>，<a href="8506.htm">8506</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>节）。这些就是这些话在内义上所表示的事：第七天在田野找不着吗哪，有人出去收集，什么也找不着。</p>

Today ye shall not find it in the field. That this signifies that then good shall no longer be acquired by means of truth, is evident from the signification of "not finding," when predicated of the good 
which is obtained by means of truth, as being to acquire no longer; and from the signification of "field," as being man, here the mind of the man in which good is implanted by means of truth; for 
man is called "a field" from the fact that he receives the truths of faith, which are seeds, and brings forth the fruits of the seeds, which are goods.  [2] How the case herein is shall be briefly told. 
Before regeneration man acts from truth, but through it good is acquired; for truth becomes good with him when it becomes of his will, and thus of his life; but after regeneration he acts from good, 
and through it truths are procured. To make this still clearer: Before regeneration man acts from obedience; but after regeneration from affection. These two states are inverse to each other; for in 
the former state truth rules, but in the latter good rules; or, in the former state man looks downward or backward, but in the latter upward or forward.  [3] When a man is in the latter state, that 
is, when he acts from affection, he is no longer allowed to look back, and to do good from truth, for at that time the Lord flows into the good with him, and leads him by means of the good. If at that 
time he were to look back, or were to do good from truth, he would act from his own; for he who acts from truth leads himself, whereas he who acts from good is led by the Lord. This is what is meant 
by these words of the Lord: </p>
<p>     When ye see the abomination of desolation, let him that is upon the house not go down to take anything out of his house; and let him that is in the field not return 
back to take his garments (Matt. 24:15, 17, 18).      In that day, whosoever shall be upon the house, and his vessels in the house, let him not go down to take them away; and whosoever is in the field, 
let him likewise not turn back to the things behind him. Remember Lot's wife (Luke 17:31, 32). (How the case is further with these things see what has been unfolded above, n. 3652, 5895, 5897, 7923, 
and what will be unfolded below, n. 8506, 8510.) These are the things which in the internal sense are signified by the words that "the manna would not be found in the field on the seventh day," and 
"that there went out some of the people for to gather and they found none." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8505</b></p><p><b>8505.</b>
'Today you will not find it in the field' means that [then] there will no longer be any acquiring of good through truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'not finding', when it refers to good that is 
obtained through truth, as no longer acquiring; and from the meaning of 'the field' as a person, at this point a person's mind in which good is implanted through truth. For a person is called a field 
because he receives the truths of faith, which are the seeds, and brings forth the fruit of the seeds, that is, forms of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What this implies will be stated briefly. Before regeneration a 
person's actions spring from truth; but through that truth good is acquired, for during this time truth becomes good with him when it becomes part of his will and so of his life. But after regeneration 
his actions spring from good, and through that good truths are gained. To put it more intelligibly, before regeneration a person's actions spring from a spirit of obedience, but after regeneration from 
affection. The two states are the antithesis of each other; for in the former state truth is dominant, but in the latter good is dominant. Or, in the former state the person looks downwards or backwards, 
but in the latter upwards or forwards. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When a person has reached the latter state, that is to say, when his actions spring from affection, he is no longer allowed to look back and do good 
from truth; for now the Lord is flowing into good, and leading him through that good If in this state he were to look back, that is, to do good from truth, his actions would spring from what is his 
own; for when a person's actions spring from truth he is guided by self, but when they spring from good he is guided by the Lord. These things are what is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
When 
you see the abomination of desolation, let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house; and let him who is in the field not return to take his clothes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:15-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:15-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day, whoever will be on the housetop with his vessels in the house let him not come down to take them away; and whoever is in the field, let him likewise not return to the things 
behind him. Remember Lot's wife. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:-31,32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:-31,32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For more about what these words imply, see the explanations in <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="5895.htm">5895</a> (end), <a href="5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="7923.htm">7923</a>, and below in <a href="8506.htm">8506</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>. </p>
<p>Such are the things meant 
in the internal sense by the words stating that the man[na] will not be found in the field on the seventh day and that some of the people went out to gather it but did not find any. </p>

`Hodie non {1}invenietis illud in agro': quod significet quod [tunc] non amplius (x)acquiretur bonum per verum, constat ex significatione `non invenire' cum praedicatur de bono quod per verum, quod sit 
non amplius acquirere, et ex significatione `agri' quod sit homo, hic mens hominis cui implantatur bonum per verum; homo enim dicitur ager ex eo quod recipiat vera fidei, quae sunt semina, et producat 
fructus seminum, {2}qui sunt bona. 	2 Quomodo cum hoc se habet, paucis dicetur: homo ante regenerationem agit ex vero, {3}at per id {4}acquiritur bonum, verum enim tunc fit bonum apud illum, cum 
fit voluntatis et sic vitae; at post regenerationem agit ex bono, et per id {5}comparantur vera; ut {6}hoc melius intelligatur, homo ante regenerationem agit ex oboedientia, at post regenerationem ex 
affectione; sunt bini illi status sibi inversi, nam in priore statu dominatur verum, in posteriore autem dominatur bonum, aut in priore statu spectat homo deorsum {7}aut retrorsum, in posteriore autem 
sursum aut antrorsum; cum homo in posteriore statu est, nempe 3 cum ex affectione agit, non amplius licet ei retrospicere, et agere bonum ex vero, nam tunc influit Dominus in bonum, et per bonum illum 
ducit; si tunc retrospiceret, seu ageret bonum ex vero, (x)ex suo ageret, qui enim ex vero agit (x)semet ducit, at qui ex bono a Domino ducitur; haec sunt quae intelliguntur per Domini verba apud Matthaeum, Cum 
videritis abominationem desolationis, qui super domo est, ne descendat ad tollendum quid e domo sua; et qui in agro, ne revertatur retro ad tollendum vestimenta sua, xxiv 15-18: </p>
<p>et apud 
Lucam, In illo die, quicumque erit super domo, et vasa illius in domo, ne descendito ad tollendum illa; et quicumque in agro, similiter ne revertatur in quae post illum; mementote uxoris Lothi, xvii 
31, 32; </p>
<p>{8} quomodo cum his porro se habet, videantur quae n. 3652, 5895 fin., 5897, 7923, explicata sunt, et quae infra n. 8506, 8510; haec sunt quae in sensu interno significantur per illa verba, 
quod `man non inveniretur in agro die septimo,' et per quod `exiverint e populo ad colligendum, et non invenerint.' 	@1 invenietur IT$ 	@2 quae$ 	@3 et$ 	@4 sibi acquirit$ 	@5 sibi comparat$ 	@6
