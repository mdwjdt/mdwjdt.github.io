<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8626节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8626.</strong>“耶和华必世世代代和亚玛力争战”表他们被主的神性能力征服，并被投入地狱，永远不可能从这地中狱上来。这从“耶和华争战”和“世世代代”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华争战”是指投入地狱；“世世代代”是指永恒，因此，他们永远不可能从这地狱中上来。这一切是由主的神性能力成就的（参看<a href="8625.htm">8625</a>e节）。“耶和华争战”之所以表示投入地狱，是因为“耶和华争战”是指永恒的胜利。地狱恶魔绝无可能向耶和华，也就是主发动战争并与祂争战。但在他们看来，他们似乎在争战；事实上，有时当他们征服了那些沉浸于邪恶的人时，觉得自己似乎得胜了。然而，他们没有攻击神性的任何能力；每次被召唤时，一丁点神性能力就足以立刻驯服整个魔鬼团伙，即使这个团伙由数百万人组成。然而，祂允许他们有机会行动，只要他们的行动能服务于有用的目的，并且主能将他们的邪恶转变为良善；关于这个主题，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在别处予以论述。由此能在某种程度上看出，“耶和华必世世代代和亚玛力争战”表示被主的神性能力征服，并被投入地狱，他们永远无法从那里上来。</p>

Jehovah shall have war against Amalek from generation to generation. That this signifies that they were brought under the yoke and were cast into hell, from which by reason of the Lord's Divine power 
they can never rise up, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah having war," as being a casting into hell: and from the signification of "from generation to generation," as being perpetually, thus 
that they can never rise up from it. (That this was by the Divine power of the Lord, see just above, n. 8625.) That "Jehovah having war" denotes a casting into hell, is because "Jehovah having war" 
denotes perpetual victory. The infernal genii cannot possibly wage war and fight against Jehovah, that is, against the Lord; yet it appears to them that they fight, and even that they sometimes conquer, 
when they subjugate those who are in evil; but still they have no power whatever against the Divine. The least exercise of Divine power by a single nod instantly subdues the whole diabolical crew, 
even if it consists of myriads of myriads; but still it gives them the opportunity to act insofar as their doing so may be of use, and insofar as their evil can be turned by the Lord into good. On this 
subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy, elsewhere. From all this it can in some measure be seen that by "Jehovah having war with Amalek from generation to generation" is signified subjugation and casting 
into hell, from which by reason of the Lord's Divine power they can never rise up. </p>

'The war of Jehovah will be against Amalek from generation to generation' means that by the Lord's Divine power they have been subjugated and cast into hell, out of which they can never rise up. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'the war of Jehovah' as being cast into hell; and from the meaning of 'from generation to generation' as everlastingly, so that they can never rise up out of it. This is 
done to them by the Lord's Divine power, see immediately above in <a href="8625.htm">8625</a> (end). The reason why 'the war of Jehovah' means being cast into hell is that the war of Jehovah is everlasting victory. Hellish 
genii are completely incapable of waging war and fighting against Jehovah, that is, the Lord. But it seems to them that they fight; indeed it also seems to them sometimes that they are victorious, when 
they subdue those immersed in evil. Nevertheless they have no power whatever against the Divine; the smallest amount of Divine power is enough, every time it is called on, to tame instantly the entire 
devil's crew, even if it consisted of millions. However He allows them the opportunity to act, just so far as their activity may serve a useful purpose and the Lord can turn their evil into good, a 
subject which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt with elsewhere.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> All this goes some way to prove that 'the war of Jehovah will be against Amalek from generation to generation' means being subjugated 
by the Lord's Divine power and cast into hell, from where they can never rise up.

`Bellum Jehovae in Amalekum a generatione generationem': quod significet quod sub jugum redacti et in infernum conjecti, unde exsurgere nusquam possunt, ex Divina Domini potentia, constat ex significatione

videatur mox supra n. 8625 fin.  Quod `bellum Jehovae' sit conjectio in infernum, est quia bellum Jehovae est perpetua victoria; infernales genii contra Jehovam, hoc est, Dominum, nullatenus possunt 
bellum gerere et pugnare, sed apparet illis quod pugnent, immo etiam {2}quandoque quod vincant, cum illos qui in malo sunt subjugant, sed usque illis prorsus nulla potentia est contra Divinum; 
minimum potentiae Divinae omnem turbam diabolicam, si vel myriades myriadum forent, ad omnem nutum momento domat; ast dat illis copiam agendi, quantum inde usus fit, et malum illorum a Domino in bonum
