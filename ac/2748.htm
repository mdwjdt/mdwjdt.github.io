<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2748节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2748.</strong>有些灵人在世时过着行淫的生活，他们来与我交谈。我发现他们进入来世的时间不长，因为他们不知道自己在哪里，还以为他们仍在世上。他们被剥夺了反思自己在哪里的能力，我被允许告诉他们说，他们在来世。但他们很快就忘了，打听哪里有房子能让他们进去。我问他们是不是不尊重属灵事物，也就是说，不尊重被这类诱惑所摧毁的婚姻之爱。我告诉他们，这种事违背天堂秩序。但他们对此毫不在意，也不明白我在说什么。我继续问他们是不是不害怕法律和法律制裁，但他们藐视这些事。不过，当我说，恐怕他们会被仆人们狠狠揍一顿时，他们这才有点害怕。后来，我觉察到他们的思维，因为在来世，思维都是相通的。它们是如此淫秽下流，以至于正直的人感到无比震惊；然而，在来世，这些事，哪怕是每一个细节，都暴露在灵人和天使面前。由此清楚可知，这种人不可能在天堂。</p>

Some spirits who in the world had lived a life of adultery, came and spoke to me. I perceived that they had not been long in the other life, for they did not know that they were there, thinking that 
they were still in the world, and reflection as to where they were, being taken away from them. It was given to tell them that they were in the other life; but soon forgetting it, they asked where there 
were houses into which they might get introduced. But they were asked whether they had no respect for spiritual things, namely, for conjugial love, which is broken up by such allurements; and they 
were told that such things are contrary to heavenly order. But to this they paid no attention, neither did they understand what was said. I inquired further whether they did not fear the laws, and punishments 
according to the laws; but these things they held in contempt. But when I said that perhaps they would be severely beaten by the servants, this alone they feared. It was afterwards given to perceive 
their thoughts, which are communicated in the other life. They were so filthy and obscene that the well disposed could not but be struck with horror; and yet they are made manifest as to each 
and every particular before spirits and angels in the other life. From all this it is evident that such cannot be in heaven. </p>

Certain spirits who had led adulterous lives in the world came and talked to me. I realized that they had not been very long in the next life, for they did not know that they were there but imagined 
that they were still in the world. The ability to reflect where they were had been taken away from them. I was allowed to tell them that they were in the next life; but they soon forgot and began to ask 
where there were houses where they might worm themselves in. But I asked them whether they had no respect for spiritual things, that is to say, for conjugial love, which is destroyed by such seducings. 
I told them that such things were contrary to heavenly order; but to all this they paid no attention nor even understood what I was saying. I went on to ask whether they had no fear of the laws, 
or of punishments according to the law. But these they held in contempt. Only when I said that perhaps they would be severely beaten with sticks by the servants in those houses did they feel any fear. 
After that I was given to perceive their thoughts, for in the next life thoughts are communicated. They were so filthy and obscene that the upright were positively horrified; yet those things - every 
single one - are in the next life exposed before spirits and angels. From all this it may become clear that such persons cannot be in heaven. </p>

</p><b>2748.</b>
Quidam spiritus qui adulterii vitam in mundo egerunt, ad me veniebant, mecum locuti; appercipiebam quod non diu in altera vita fuerint, nesciebant enim quod ibi essent, putantes adhuc esse in mundo; 
reflexio ubinam essent (c)illis adempta fuit; iis dicere datum quod in altera vita essent, sed mox obliti, quaerebant ubinam essent domus, ubi se insinuare possent, sed dictum annon respectum haberent 
spiritualium, nempe amoris conjugialis, qui per similia allectamenta dissociatur, et quod contra ordinem caelestem esset, se ad haec nihil attendebant, nec illa intelligebant; dixi porro, annon timerent 
leges, et punitiones secundum leges, sed haec contemnebant; at cum dixi, forte a domesticis tractarentur male verberibus, haec solum timebant.  Dei percipere dabatur eorum cogitationes, nam illae 
communicantur in altera vita erant tam spurcae et obscenae ut probi non possint non horrescere, quae tamen quoad omnia et singula in altera vita propalantur coram spiritibus et angelis: inde etiam constare 
potest quod tales non possint esse in caelo. </p>
