<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8722节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8722.</strong>“这众百姓也都平平安安来到自己的地方”表那些属于属灵教会的人将因此处于良善，并通过良善被引导。这从“百姓”、“来到自己的地方”和“平平安安”的含义清楚可知：“百姓”、“来到一个地方”和“平平安安”的含义清楚可知：“百姓”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，因为“百姓”是指以色列人，而以色列人代表属灵教会；“来到一个地方”是指抵达他们要被引向的状态，这种状态就是一种良善的状态，因为那些属于属灵教会的人通过真理被引向良善，当他们抵达良善时，便来到自己的地方，“地方”表示状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>，<a href="7381.htm">7381</a>节）；“平平安安”是指在良善里面的神性，因为“平安”在至高意义上是指主，并因此是指，它从至内在影响良善，就是那些处于良善之人的幸福的本质。只要一个人处于真理，尚未处于良善，他就没有宁静；但当处于良善时，他便处于一种宁静的状态，从而处于平安之中。原因在于，恶灵不能攻击良善，而是一发觉它，就逃之夭夭；但他们能攻击真理。正因如此，当人们处于良善时，他们便处于平安之中。这些就是“这众百姓也都平平安安来到自己的地方”所表示的事。至于什么叫通过真理被主引导，什么叫通过良善被主引导，可参看前文（<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8539.htm">8539</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）。</p>

And also all this people shall come upon its place in peace. That this signifies that they who are of the spiritual church shall thus be in good, and shall be led by means of good, is evident from the 
signification of "the people," as being those who are of the spiritual church, because by "the people" are meant the sons of Israel, by whom is represented the spiritual church; from the signification 
of "coming unto a place," as being to the state to which they shall be led, which state is a state of good; for they who are of the spiritual church are led by means of truth to good, and when they 
come to good, then they come to their own place (that "place" denotes state see n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381); and from the signification of "peace," as being the Divine in good; 
for in the supreme sense "peace" denotes the Lord, and it is from this that it inmostly affects good, and is the very being of the happiness of those who are in good. So long as man is in truth, and 
not yet in good, he is in an untranquil state; but when he is in good, then he is in a tranquil state, thus in peace. The reason is that evil spirits cannot attack good, but flee away at the first perception 
of it; whereas they can attack truth. Hence it is that when men are in good, they are in peace. This is what is signified by "all this people shall come upon its place in peace." (What it is to 
be led by the Lord by means of truth, and what by means of good, see n. 8516, 8539, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701.) </p>

'And also all this people will come upon their place in peace' means that those belonging to the spiritual Church will be governed by good and thus led by good. This is clear from the meaning of 'people' 
as those belonging to the spiritual Church, for by 'people' one should understand the children of Israel, who represent the spiritual Church; from the meaning of 'coming to their place' as arriving 
at the state to which they are going to be led, which state is a state of good, since those who belong to the spiritual Church are led through truth to good, and when they arrive at good they come 
to their place, 'place' meaning state, see <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, <a href="7381.htm">7381</a>; and from the meaning of 'peace' as the Divine within good, for 'peace' in the highest sense is the Lord, and 
is therefore the influence inmostly at work within good and is the very essence (esse) of the happiness of those governed by good. As long as a person is governed by truth and not as yet by good he has 
no serenity; but when he is governed by good he does have serenity and so is 'in peace'. The reason for this is that evil spirits cannot attack good but flee from it the moment they are aware of it; 
but they can attack truth. So it is that when people are governed by good they are 'in peace'. These are the things that are meant by 'all the people will come upon their place in peace'. What it is 
to be led by the Lord through truth, and what it is to be led by Him through good, see <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8539.htm">8539</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>. </p>

`Et etiam omnis populus hic super locum suum veniet in pace': quod significet quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in bono erunt, et sic ex bono ducentur, constat ex significatione `populi' quod sint 
qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quia per `populum' intelliguntur filii Israelis, per quos repraesentatur {1}Ecclesia spiritualis; ex significatione `ad locum suum venire' quod sit ad statum ad quem ducentur, 
qui status est status boni, nam illi qui {2}sunt ab Ecclesia spirituali, per verum ad bonum ducuntur, et cum ad bonum, tunc ad locum suum {3} veniunt; quod `locus' sit status, videatur n. 2625, 
2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, (x)5605, 7381; et ex significatione `pacis' quod sit Divinum in bono, nam `pax' in supremo sensu est Dominus, et inde est quod intime afficit bonum, et est esse felicitatis 
illorum qui in bono sunt; quamdiu homo in vero est et nondum in bono, est in (x)in tranquillo, sed cum in bono est, tunc in tranquillo est, ita in pace; (s)causa est quia spiritus mali non aggredi 
possunt bonum sed aufugiunt ad primam apperceptionem ejus, at verum possunt aggredi; inde est quod cum in bono sunt, in pace sint;(s) haec sunt quae significantur per quod `omnis populus super locum suum 
veniet in pace.'  Quid sit a Domino per verum duci et quid per bonum, videatur n. 8516, 8539, 8643, 8648, 8648, 8685, 8690, 8701. 	@1 illa Ecclesia$ 	@2 After spirituali$ 	@3 i, hoc est, ad statum suum$ </p>
