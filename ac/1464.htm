<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1464节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1464.</strong>“因那地饥荒严重”表主外在人中的巨大匮乏。这从本节所给出的“饥荒”的含义清楚可知。此处所包含的奥秘不是简单说说就能明了的。主的学习能力远远胜过其他任何人，因为和其他人不一样的是，祂在接受属灵事物的教导之前，要接受属天事物的教导，所以此处经上提及这一点。如此提及的另一个原因是，主的外在人中有来自母亲的遗传之恶，祂要与之争战，并要战胜它。此外还有无数其它因素。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1464.</strong> The symbolism of because the famine was heavy in the land as a severe shortage in his outer self can be seen from the symbolism of famine above in this verse [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1464/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460" target=_top>1460</a>].<br />This verse holds too many secrets to list briefly. The Lord's capacity to learn outstripped any other individual's, but since unlike other people he needed to be taught heavenly knowledge before spiritual, the message applies to him. Another reason it applies is that his external self contained evil he inherited from his mother, which he would have to fight and overcome. Not to mention countless other secrets. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1464</b></p><p><b>1464.</b>
Because the famine was grievous in the land. That this signifies much scarcity in His external man, is evident from the signification of "famine," as given above in this verse. The arcana here contained 
are more than can be briefly told. The Lord had the power of learning above every other man; but because, unlike other men, He was to be instructed in celestial things before He was instructed in 
spiritual things, this is here declared; and also for the further reason that there was hereditary evil from the mother in His external man, against which He was to fight, and which He was to overcome; 
and also for other reasons innumerable. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1464</b></p><p><b>1464.</b>
'For the famine in the land was serious' means a great lack in His External Man This is clear from the meaning of 'famine' as presented above in this verse. The arcana contained here are more than can 
be enumerated briefly. The Lord's ability to learn was superior to that of any other person, but because He was to receive instruction in celestial things before doing so in spiritual things, unlike 
others, reference is made to this point here. A further reason for such a reference is that there was hereditary evil from the mother in His External Man which He was to fight against and to overcome. 
And there are countless other considerations besides these. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1464</b>
</p><b>1464.</b>
'Quia gravis fames in terra': quod significet multam penuriam apud Externum Ipsius Hominem, constat a significatione 'famis' supra in hoc versu; arcana quae hic continentur, plura sunt quam ut breviter 
possint edici; potentia addiscendi Domino fuit prae omni alio homine; sed quia in caelestibus instruendus prius quam in spiritualibus, secus ac alii homines, praedicatur hoc; ex causa etiam quia malum 
hereditarium a matre fuit in Externo Ipsius Homine, contra quod pugnaturus et quod evicturus; praeter innumera alia. </p>
