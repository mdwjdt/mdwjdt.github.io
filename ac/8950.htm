<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8950节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8950.</strong>当有人想迷惑土星灵，把他们引离对主的信，或在祂面前的谦卑，以及正直的生活时，他们说，他们就想去死。这时，只见他们手里有几把小刀，他们似乎想用这些小刀剌向自己的胸膛。当被问及为何这样做时，他们说，他们宁愿死也不愿被引离主。有时我们地球灵会因这些事取笑他们，并追问他们为何这样做。但他们回答说，他们十分清楚他们不会杀死自己，这只是从他们心智的意愿所流出的一种表象，表明他们宁可死也不愿被引离对主的敬拜。</p>

When any wish to lead astray the spirits of that earth, and draw them away from faith in the Lord, or from humility toward Him, and from uprightness of life, they say that they wish to die. Then little 
knives are seen in their hands, by which they seem to wish to pierce their breasts. When they are asked why they do so, they say that they would rather die than be led away from the Lord. Sometimes 
the spirits of our earth laugh at these things, and infest them with questionings why they do so. But they answer that they know very well that they are not going to kill themselves, and that this is 
only an appearance proceeding from the will of their mind, showing that they would rather die than be drawn away from the worship of the Lord. </p>

When any seek to lead astray the spirits belonging to that planet and to draw them away from faith in the Lord, or from humility before Him and from uprightness of life, those spirits say that they want 
to die. At the same time daggers are seen in their hands with which they seem to wish to strike their breast. When asked why they are doing this they say that they would rather die than be led away 
from the Lord. Spirits belonging to our planet sometimes make fun of them, pestering them with questions about why they behave in that way. To this however they reply that they know full well that they 
are not doing away with themselves, but that their action is an appearance flowing from the wishes of their mind, which are that they would rather die than be drawn away from worshipping the Lord. </p>

</p><b>8950.</b>
Spiritus illius telluris, quando aliqui illos volunt seducere et a fide in Dominum abstrahere, aut ab humiliatione erga Ipsum et a probitate vitae, dicunt se mori velle; apparent tunc in manibus illorum 
parvi cultri per quos pectora sua percutere velle videntur; cum interrogantur cur ita faciunt, dicunt quod potius mori velint quam abduci a Domino.  Spiritus nostrae telluris quandoque irrident illa, 
et infestant interrogationibus cur ita faciunt; sed tunc respondent, se probe scire quod semet non interimant sed quod hoc solum apparentia sit effluens ex voluntate animi illorum, quod potius mori 
velint quam abstrahi a cultu Domini. </p>
