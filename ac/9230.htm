<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9230.</strong>“因此，田间被撕裂的肉，你们不可吃”表（自己）不可与歪曲的信之良善结合。这从“肉”、“田”、“撕裂”和“吃”的含义清楚可知：“肉”是指良善（参看<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>节）；“田”是指良善方面的教会，因而教会的良善（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>，<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>，<a href="7571.htm">7571</a>，<a href="9139.htm">9139</a>，<a href="9141.htm">9141</a>节）；“撕裂”是指被虚假摧毁的某种事物，因而也指被歪曲的某种事物（<a href="5828.htm">5828</a>节）；“吃”是指变成人自己的并与自己结合（<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>，<a href="5643.htm">5643</a>，<a href="8001.htm">8001</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“田间被撕裂的肉，你们不可吃”表示不可将已经歪曲的教会良善，或信之良善变成人自己的，或与它结合。<br />必须简要说明何为信之良善，何为信之真理。与教会的信之教义所教导的生活和功用或服务有关的教会的一切，简言之，与意愿这些事并出于顺服做这些事有关的一切，就被称为“信之良善”；因为教会的信之真理通过人们意愿并行出它们而变成良善。而尚未以任何功用或有用的服务为目的，或还不是为了生活而存在的一切就被称为“信之真理”。因此，它只是被人知道，并存在记忆中，由此被理解力理解，并通过它被教导。只要教会的真理止于理解力，不再往前行，它们就仅仅是知识，相对良善来说，在这个人自己之外。因为人的记忆和理解力就像入口或房间外的门厅，而他的意愿则像内室，因为意愿才是这个人自己。这一切表明何为信之真理，何为信之良善。不过，人在第一个状态下，即他重生期间所行的良善被称为“信之良善”，而他在第二个状态下，即重生之后所行的良善则被称为“仁之良善”。因此，当人出于信之良善行善时，他是出于顺服行善；但当他出于仁之良善行善时，则是出于情感行善。关于人在重生时所经历的这两种状态，可参看前文（<a href="7923.htm">7923</a>，<a href="7992.htm">7992</a>，<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>，<a href="8506.htm">8506</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8512.htm">8512</a>，<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>，<a href="9224.htm">9224</a>，<a href="9227.htm">9227</a>节）。</p>

And flesh that is torn in the field ye shall not eat. That this signifies that the falsified good of faith shall not be conjoined is evident from the signification of "flesh," as being good (see n. 7850, 
9127); from the signification of a "field," as being the church in respect to good, thus the good of the church (n. 2971, 3766, 7502, 7571, 9139, 9141); from the signification of "what is torn," 
as being that which is destroyed through falsities, thus also what is falsified (n. 5828); and from the signification of "eating," as being to appropriate and conjoin (n. 2187, 3168, 3513, 3596, 4745, 
5643, 8001). From this it is evident that by "flesh that is torn in the field ye shall not eat" is signified that the good of the church, or the falsified good of faith, is not to be appropriated or 
conjoined.  [2] A few words shall be said about what the good of faith is, and what the truth of faith. Everything of the church is called the "good of faith," that has to do with life and use from what 
the doctrine of faith of the church teaches; in a word everything that has to do with willing it and doing it from obedience; for the truths of faith of the church become goods by willing and doing 
them. But everything is called the "truth of faith," which as yet has not any use as its end, or which as yet is not for the sake of life, consequently which is merely known and kept in the memory, 
and from this is laid hold of by the understanding, and is taught from it. For so long as the truths of the church go no further, they are merely knowledges, and relatively to goods are outside the man 
himself; for man's memory and understanding are like entries, and his will is like an inner chamber, because the will is the man himself. This shows what the truth of faith is, and what the good of 
faith. But the good which a man does in his first state during his regeneration is called the "good of faith," whereas the good which he does in the second state, namely, after he has been regenerated, 
is called the "good of charity." And therefore when a man does good from the good of faith, he does good from obedience; but when he does good from the good of charity, he does good from affection. 
(Concerning these two states with a man who is being regenerated, see n. 7923, 7992, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701, 9224, 9227.) </p>

'And you shall not eat flesh torn in the field' means that falsified good of faith must not be joined [to oneself]. This is clear from the meaning of 'flesh' as good, dealt with in <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>; from the

<p><b>[2]</b>
 A brief statement must be made here about what the good of faith is and what the truth of faith is. The good of faith is a term that denotes everything of the Church that has to do with life 
and service inspired by teachings of the Church that compose its faith, in short, everything that has to do with willing those things and doing them in a spirit of obedience; for the Church's truths 
of faith become, through people's willing them and doing them, forms of good. But the truth of faith is a term that denotes everything which does not as yet have useful service as its end in view or 
does not exist for the sake of its use in life. Consequently it is something a person comes to know and retain in the memory, then grasps with his understanding, and goes on to teach. As long as the Church's 
truths go no further than the understanding they are merely items of knowledge and known facts, and in contrast to forms of good stand outside the person himself. For the human memory and understanding 
are like the hall outside a room, and the will is so to speak the actual room, the will being the person himself. This shows what the truth of faith is and what the good of faith is. But the 
good that a person does in the first state, while he is being regenerated, is called the good of faith, whereas the good that he does in the second state, which is when he has been regenerated, is called 
the good of charity. When therefore a person doing good is governed by the good of faith, he does good in a spirit of obedience; but when someone doing good is governed by the good of charity, he 
does good out of affection. Regarding those two states with a person who is being regenerated, see <a href="7923.htm">7923</a>, <a href="7992.htm">7992</a>, <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>, <a href="8506.htm">8506</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8512.htm">8512</a>, <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>, <a href="9224.htm">9224</a>, <a href="9227.htm">9227</a>.  </p>

`Et carnem in agro (x)discerptam non comedetis': quod significet quod non conjungetur bonam fidei falsificatum, constat ex significatione `carnis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 7850, 9127, ex significatione 
`agri' quod sit Ecclesia quoad bonum, ita bonum Ecclesiae, de qua n. 2971, 3766, 7502, 7571, (x)9139, 9141, ex significatione `discerpti' quod sit per falsa destructum, ita quoque falsificatum, de 
qua n. 5828, et ex significatione `comedere' quod sit {1} appropriare (c)et conjungere, de qua n. 2187, 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 4745, 5643, 8001; inde patet quod per `carnem in agro discerptam non comedetis' 
significetur quod bonum Ecclesiae, seu bonum fidei falsificatum non appropriandum seu conjungendum. Paucis hic dicetur quid sit bonum fidei et quid verum fidei: 2 bonum fidei dicitur omne id 
Ecclesiae quod concernit vitam et usum ex illis quae doctrina fidei Ecclesiae docet, verbo, quod concernit velle illa et facere illa ex oboedientia, nam vera fidei Ecclesiae per velle et facere illa 
fiunt bona; at verum fidei dicitur omne id quod adhuc est absque fin usus aut propter vitam {2}, proinde quod scitur et in memoria tenetur, et inde capitur intellectu, et ex eo docetur; vera enim Ecclesiae 
quamdiu non (x)ulterius vadunt, sunt modo {3}cognitiones et scientifica, et sunt, respective ad bona, extra ipsum hominem; nam memoria ac intellectus hominis sunt velut atria, et voluntas est {4}velut 
conclave, nam voluntas est ipse homo; inde patet quid verum fidei et quid bonum fidei; sed bonum quod homo facit in primo statu cum regeneratur, vocatur bonum fidei, at bonum quod homo facit in 
altero statu, cum nempe regeneratus est, vocatur bonum charitatis; quare cum homo bonum facit ex bono fidei, ex oboedientia bonum facit, at cum bonum facit ex bono charitatis, ex affectione bonum facit; 
de binis illis statibus apud hominem qui regeneratur, videatur n. 7923, 7992, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701, 9224, 9227. @1 i sibi$ @2 i est$ @3 scientifica et
