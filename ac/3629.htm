<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3629节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3629.</strong>很少有人相信真相会是这样，因为人们不知道何为属灵的，何为属世的，更不知道这些彼此之间有何区别。他们不知道何为对应，何为流注，并且属灵的在流入身体器官形式时，会呈现出诸如那里所发生的活生生的运作。他们也不知道，若没有这种流注和对应，甚至连身体最微小的粒子也无法拥有生命，或被驱动。我通过亲身经历所获悉的这些事向我显明：不仅总体上的天堂流入进来，而且具体的社群也流入进来；也显明流入某个身体器官和肢体的是哪些社群，及其品质；还显明不只是一个社群，而是很多社群流入任意一个器官或肢体，并且每个社群都由许多天使组成；那里的天使越多，这种对应关系就越好越强大，因为完美和力量来自以天堂形式行如一体的许多个体的万众一心。许多人的这种一致性会带来更完美、更强大的努力，以作用于个体部分。</p>

That the case is thus, few can believe, because men do not know what the spiritual is, and what the natural, and still less how these are distinguished from each other; also what correspondence is, and 
what influx; and that the spiritual, when it flows into the organic forms of the body, presents living operations such as appear; and that without such influx and correspondence not even the most minute 
particle of the body can have life and be moved. As to these things I have been informed by living experience that not only heaven in general flows in, but also the societies in particular; likewise 
what the societies are and of what quality which flow into this and that organ of the body, and into this and that member; and further, that there is not one society only which flows into each organ 
or member, but very many, and that in each society also there are very many; for the more there are, so much the better and stronger is the correspondence, inasmuch as perfection and strength are 
from the unanimous multitude of many who act as a one in a heavenly form; hence results a more perfect and stronger endeavor into particulars according to the numbers. </p>

Few are able to believe that all this is so, for the reason that they do not know what the spiritual is and what the natural is, let alone what distinguishes one from the other. Also, they do not know 
what correspondence is and what influx is, and that when the spiritual flows into the organic forms belonging to the body, it establishes the living workings such as occur there. Nor do they know that 
without such influx and correspondence not even the smallest parts of the body can have life or be set in motion. These things I have learned about from actual experience, which has shown me not only 
that heaven in general flows in but also that specific communities do so; also which communities, and the character of those flowing into this or that organ of the body, and into this or that limb. 
It has shown me that not one community but very many flow into any one organ or limb, and that each community consists of very many angels; for the more angels there are the better and stronger the correspondence, 
since perfection and strength are the product of a like-minded multitude of many individuals who in the heavenly form act as one. This accordance of the many leads to a more perfect and 
stronger endeavour acting into individual parts. </p>

Quod ita se habeat, pauci possunt credere, ex causa quia non norunt quid spirituale et quid naturale, et minus quomodo inter se distincta {1}sunt, tum quid correspondentia et quid influxus, et quod 
spirituale cum influit in formas organicas corporis, sistat operationes vivas quales apparent; et quod, absque tali influxu et correspondentia, ne quidem minima particula corporis possit vitam habere, 
et moveri:  haec quomodo se habent, per vivam experientiam informatus sum, non modo quod caelum in communi influat, sed etiam quod societates {2}in specie; tum quaenam societates sunt et quales illae{3}, 
quae in hoc et illud organum corporis, et in hoc et illud ejus membrum; tum quod societas non una sit quae in unumquodvis organum {4}seu membrum, sed quod perplures; et quod in unaquavis societate 
etiam perplures sint; nam quo plures sunt, eo melior et fortior correspondentia, quia perfectio et fortitudo est a multitudine unanima plurium qui unum in forma caelesti agunt; inde conatus in singula 
secundum pluralitatem perfectior et fortior resultat. @1 sint$ @2 i caeli$ @3 i sunt$ @4 et$ </p>
