<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9258节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9258.</strong>“不要为他移去重驮”表不接受真理。这从“不要移去”的含义清楚可知，“不要移去”是指不给予教导并纠正，在此是指不能接受教导，因而不能接受真理，因为所说的话论及与教会的良善不一致的虚假，这虚假就具有这种性质。“移去”在灵义上就具有这种含义，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：这些话用来论及正在讨论的主题。因此，“移去”在字义上用来论及驴卧于其下的重驮，在内义上用来论及与教会的良善不一致的虚假。故就内义而言，所表示的是没有通过纠正移除虚假，因而也没有通过这种纠正或移除所带来的对真理的接受。既有与教会的良善一致的虚假，也有与它不一致的虚假。一致的虚假就是有良善藏在它们里面，因此能通过这良善被折向真理的虚假。而与教会的良善不一致的虚假则是有邪恶藏在它们里面，因此不能被折向真理的虚假。<br />至于藏在纯正真理，或就在前面被称为虚假的非纯正真理里面的良善，以及藏在虚假里面，甚至也藏在真理里面的邪恶，这良善或邪恶就像果实种子中生命的生殖胚芽。当果实开始生长时，它的所有纤维都专注于种子的生殖胚芽；它们用渗透的汁液滋养并形成它。不过，一旦它形成，纤维就会退出离开它，并把汁液从种子中带走。结果，果肉变质腐烂，然后作为土壤而服务于生殖胚芽。当种子中的生殖胚芽在地里开始新的发育阶段时，种子本身也是如此。新芽中的生殖胚芽对应于一个人里面的良善；种子本身对应于他的内在事物或内在部分；种子周围的果肉对应于外在事物或外在部分。当人的内在部分正在重新形成，或正在重生时，外在人的记忆知识和真理就像果实的纤维，汁液通过它们被输送到内在部分。然后，当这个人已经重生时，外在人的记忆知识和真理也被分离出去并充作内在部分的土壤。类似的事也发生在种子所对应的此人的内在部分。在这种情况下，以这种方式形成的良善就产生一个新人，就像种子中的生殖胚芽产生一棵新树，或一个新芽一样。万物就这样变得焕然一新，之后增多结果，直到永远。正因如此，新人变得像一个花园，一个天堂花园；在圣言中，他也被比作这样的园子。<br />这就是主在马太福音所说这些话的含义：<br />天国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在田里。这原是百种里最小的，等到长起来，却比各样的菜都大，且成了树，天上的飞鸟也来在它的枝头搭窝。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.31.htm">13:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.32.htm">32</a>）<br />由此可见含有良善在里面的纯正真理和不纯正真理是何情形，即：良善形成后，就会产生诸如与良善一致的那类真理；即便是不纯正的真理，它们也被当作纯正的来接受，因为它们具有良善的味道；事实上，它们从良善获得自己的本质存在和生命。良善通过真理来繁殖和发展，它在发展期间，不断努力产生一种含有类似繁殖能力的新良善。它的作用方式，就像种子的生殖胚芽在为产生新果实和新种子而破土而出的新芽或新树中的作用方式一样。不过，种类是不计其数的，其不同性质取决于通过遵行信之诫命的仁爱生活而已经形成的良善。<br />从对立面能看出含有邪恶在里面的虚假是怎么回事，即：它们就像结坏果子，必须被连根拔起并扔进火里的树，正如主在马太福音中所说的：<br />凡好树都结好果子；惟独坏树结坏果子。好树不能结坏果子，坏树不能结好果子。凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。所以，凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.17.htm">7:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.33.htm">12:33</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，枝子若不连在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子；你们若不住在我里面，也是这样。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。人若不住在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人收集起来扔在火里烧了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">6</a>）<br />由此明显可知，凡结果子的良善都始于主，它若不来自主，就不是良善。</p>

And wouldest forbear to remove it for him. That this signifies no reception of truth, is evident from the signification of "to forbear from removing," as being not to instruct and amend, here not to 
be capable of receiving instruction, thus not to receive truth, because it is said of the falsity which does not agree with the good of the church, and this falsity is of this nature. That in the spiritual 
sense "to remove" denotes this, is evident from the fact that words apply themselves to the subject; thus in the sense of the letter "to remove" applies to the burden under which the ass is lying; 
and in the internal sense to the falsity which does not agree with the good of the church; and therefore in this sense there is signified no removal from falsity by means of amendment, thus also no 
reception of truth whereby there may be amendment or removal. There are falsities which agree with the good of the church, and there are falsities which do not agree with it. The falsities which agree 
are those in which good lies hidden, and which, therefore, by means of good, can be bent toward truths. But the falsities which do not agree with the good of the church are those in which evil lies 
hidden, and which therefore cannot be bent toward truths.  [2] The good which lies hidden within genuine truths, or within truths not genuine, which just above were called falsities, and the evil which 
lies hidden in falsities, and also in truths, are like the prolific germ in the seed of fruit. When the fruit is being formed, all its fibers look toward the prolific germ of the seed, and by means 
of the permeating sap they nourish it and form it; but when it has been formed, the fibers retire, and convey the sap away from the seed, thus causing the pulp of the fruit to shrivel and decay, and 
afterward serve the prolific germ as soil. The case is the same with the seed itself, when its prolific germ begins to put itself forth anew in the earth. The prolific germ in plants corresponds to the 
good in man. The seed itself corresponds to internal things, and the pulp of the fruit encompassing the seed corresponds to external things. When the internal of man is being formed anew, or is being 
regenerated, the memory-knowledges and truths of the external man are like the fibers of fruit, through which the sap is carried over to the internal; and afterward, when the man has been regenerated, 
the memory-knowledges and truths of the external man are also separated, and serve as soil. The case is the same with the internal of man, to which the seed corresponds. In this case the good which 
has been formed in this manner produces a new man, just as the prolific germ in the seed produces a new tree, or a new plant. Thus all things are made new, and afterward multiply and bear fruit to eternity; 
consequently the new man becomes like a garden and a paradise, to which he is also compared in the Word. [3] This is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The kingdom of the heavens is 
like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven 
come and make their nests in its branches (Matt. 13:31-32). From all this it can be seen how the case is with truths, both genuine and not genuine, that have good within them, namely, that after 
good has been formed, it produces such truths as agree with the good; and even if these are not genuine truths, they are nevertheless accepted as genuine, because they savor of good, for from this they 
derive their essence and life. For good prolificates and brings itself forth by means of truths, and in this bringing of itself forth it is in the continual endeavor to produce a new good, in which 
there shall be a like prolific germ; just as the prolific germ of a seed acts in the case of a plant or tree, when it pushes itself forth from the earth for the sake of new fruits, and new seeds. But 
the varieties are endless, and are according to the goods that are formed by a life of charity in accordance with the precepts of faith. [4] From the opposite it can be seen how the case is with falsities 
in which is evil, namely, that they are like trees which bear evil fruits, and which are to be rooted up and cast into the fire, according to the Lord's words in these passages: </p>
<p>     Every good 
tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth 
not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them (Matt. 7:17-20; 12:33).      Jesus said, As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide 
in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing. If a 
man abide not in Me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither; and they gather him, and cast him into the fire, and he is burned (John 15:4-6). From this it is evident that all good which 
shall bear any fruit is from the Lord, and that unless it is from Him it is not good. </p>

'And you would cease from removing [it] for him' means not receiving truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'ceasing from removing' as not giving instruction and correcting, at this point not being 
able to receive instruction, and so not receiving truth since what is said refers to falsity which does not accord with the Church's good, and that falsity is such. The fact that 'removing' has this 
meaning in the spiritual sense is evident from this consideration, that words are used with reference to the matter under discussion. Thus 'removing' is used in the sense of the letter with reference 
to the burden under which the ass lies, and in the internal sense with reference to the falsity that is not in accord with the Church's good. In the internal sense therefore not removing from falsity 
by means of correction is meant, thus also not receiving truth brought about through such correcting or removing. There are falsities which are in accord with the Church's good, and there are falsities 
which are not in accord with it. The falsities that are in accord are ones which have good lying hidden within them, and which for that reason can be brought by the good nearer to truths. But the falsities 
that are not in accord with the Church's good are ones which have evil lying hidden within them, and which for that reason cannot be brought nearer to truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the good which 
lies within authentic truths, or else within unauthentic truths, which have been called falsities immediately above, and as regards the evil within falsities and even within truths, that good or evil 
is like the reproductive germ of life in the seed of a fruit. When the fruit starts to grow all its fibres fix their attention on the germ in the seed; they nourish it with juice passing through them 
and form it. But once it has been formed the fibres forsake it and convey the juice away from the seed. As a consequence the flesh of the fruit deteriorates and goes rotten, and then it serves the germ 
as its soil. The same applies to the seed itself when the germ in it begins a new phase of development in the ground. The germ of life in new shoots corresponds to the good within a person; the seed 
itself corresponds to the inward parts of his being; and the flesh around the seed corresponds to the outward parts. When the inward part of a person is formed anew or regenerated, the factual knowledge 
and truths belonging to the external man are like the fibres of a fruit through which juice is transported to the inward part. And afterwards, when the person has been regenerated, they are separated 
and serve as the soil [for the inward part]. Something similar happens in the person's inward part to which the seed corresponds. The good which has been formed in that manner gives rise to a new 
person, just as the germ within the seed develops into a new tree or new shoot. In this way all things are made new, after which they multiply and remain fruitful for evermore. So it is that the new 
person becomes like a garden, a paradise garden, to which also he is compared in the Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is the meaning of the Lord's words in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard 
seed which a person took and sowed in his field, which is the smallest of all seeds. But when it has grown it is the greatest of all plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and 
nest in its branches. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:31,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:31, 32</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These words make clear what the situation is with authentic truths and unauthentic truths which have good within them, namely this: When the good has been 
formed it gives rise to truths such as are in accord with good. Even if they are unauthentic truths they are accepted as though they were authentic ones because they savour of good; for they derive their 
very being and life from it. Good germinates and develops by means of truths, and while it is developing it is constantly endeavouring to give birth to new good which holds a like ability to germinate. 
It acts in much the same way as the seed's reproductive germ does in a new shoot or tree when this comes up out of the ground and exists to produce new fruit and new seeds. But there are endless 
varieties, the different natures of which are determined by the kinds of good that have been formed through a charitable life led in keeping with the commandments of faith.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 By contrast one can 
see also what the situation is with falsities which have evil within them, namely that they are like trees which bear bad fruit, which must be uprooted and thrown into the fire, in accordance with the 
Lord's words in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Every good tree bears good fruit, but a rotten tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a rotten tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not 
bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:17-20;%2012:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:17-20; 12:33</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless 
it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from Me you cannot 
do anything. If a person does not abide in Me he will be cast forth as a branch and be withered; and they gather it and throw it into the fire, and it is burned. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:4-6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is evident 
that all good which is going to bear any fruit begins in the Lord, and unless it comes from Him it is not good.  </p>

`Et cessaveris a removendo ei': quod significet non receptionem veri, constat ex significatione `cessare a removendo' quod sit non instruere et emendare, hic non posse instrui, ita non recipere verum, 
quia de falso dicitur quod non concordat cum bono Ecclesiae, id falsum tale est; quod `removere' in sensu spirituali id sit, patet ex eo quia voces se applicant ad rem, {1}sic `removere' {2}in sensu 
litterae `ad onus sub quo asinus cubat,' et {3}in sensu interno ad falsum quod non concordat cum bono Ecclesiae, quapropter in hoc sensu significatur non remotio a falso per emendationem, ita quoque 
non receptio veri per quod emendatio seu remotio.  Sunt falsa quae concordant cum bono Ecclesiae, et sunt falsa quae non concordant cum illo; falsa quae concordant sunt in quibus bonum latet, et quae 
sic per bonum flecti possunt ad vera, at falsa quae non concordant cum bono Ecclesiae sunt in quibus malum latet, et quae sic non flecti possunt ad vera. 2 Cum bono quod intus latet in veris genuinis 
aut in veris non genuinis, quae {4}nunc supra falsa dicta sunt, et cum malo quod intus in {5}falsis et quoque in veris, se habet sicut cum prolifico in semine fructus; cum fructus nascitur, tunc omnes 
fibrae ejus spectant versus prolificum seminis, et per sucum transmeantem alunt id et formant id, at cum formatum est, tunc recedunt fibrae et vehunt sucum a semine; inde caro fructus fatiscit et putrescit, 
et dein inservit prolifico pro humo; similiter se habet cum ipso semine cum prolificum ejus incohat e novo producere se in terra; prolificum in plantis correspondet bono in homine, ipsum semen 
correspondet internis {6}, et caro fructus circum semen correspondet externis; cum internum hominis e novo {7}formatur seu regeneratur, tunc scientifica et vera quae {8} externi hominis, sunt sicut 
fibrae fructus, per quas sucus transfertur ad internum, quae quoque postea cum homo regeneratus est, separantur et inserviunt pro humo; similiter fit cum interno hominis, cui (t)semen correspondet; tunc 
bonum quod ita formatum est producit novum hominem sicut (x)prolificum in semine novam arborem vel novam plantam; fiunt sic omnia nova, et {9} postea multiplicantur et fructificantur in aeternum; 
inde homo novus fit sicut hortus ac paradisus, cum 3 quibus {10}etiam comparatur in Verbo.  Hoc intelligitur per Domini Verba apud (x)Matthaeum, Simile est regnum caelorum grano sinapis, quod accipiens 
homo seminavit in agro suo, quod minus est omnibus seminibus; quando autem excrevit, majus est oleribus, et fit arbor, ita ut veniant volatilia caeli et nidulentur in ramis ejus, xiii [31,] 32. {11} 
Ex his {12} constare potest quomodo se habet cum {13}veris genuinis et non genuinis, in quibus intus est bonum, quod nempe, cum bonum formatum est, tunc producat talia vera quae concordant cum bono; 
quae tametsi non genuina vera sunt, usque tamen acceptantur sicut genuina quia sapiunt ex bono, nam inde essentiam et vitam suam trahunt; bonum enim prolificat et producit se per vera, et in productione 
in continuo conatu est novum bonum, in quo simile prolificum sit, parere; similiter ac facit prolificum seminis in planta aut arbore, dum e terra profert se {14} propter novos fructus et {15} nova 
semina; sed varietates {16}perpetuae sunt quae se habent secundum bona formata per vitam charitatis secundum praecepta fidei. Ex opposito videri potest quomodo se habet cum falsis in quibus 4 malum, 
quod nempe sint sicut arbores quae malos fructus ferunt, quae exstirpandae et in ignem conjiciendae, secundum Domini verba apud Matthaeum, Omnis arbor bona fructus bonos facit, putris autem arbor 
fructus malos facit; non potest arbor bona fructus malos facere, neque arbor putris fructus bonos facere; omnis arbor quae non facit fructum bonum exscinditur et in ignem conjicitur; quare ex fructibus 
eorum cognoscetis eos, vii 17-20, {17} xii 33: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Quemadmodum palmes non potest fructum ferre a seipso ni manserit in vite, ita neque vos nisi in Me (x)manseritis; Ego 
sum vitis, vos palmites; qui manet in Me et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum, quia sine Me non potestis facere quicquam; nisi quis manserit in Me, ejicietur foras sicut palmes et arefiet, et colligunt 
illum et in ignem conjiciunt, comburiturque, xv 4-6; </p>
