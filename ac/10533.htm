<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10533节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10533</strong>.“恐怕我在路上把你们灭绝”表如果神性之物真的流入并与这个民族同住，那么这个民族就会被毁灭。这从“灭绝”的含义清楚可知，“灭绝”是指被毁灭。显而易见，如果神性之物真的流入并与这个民族同住，那么这个民族就会被毁灭，因为经上说“我就不在你们中间上去，恐怕我在路上把你们灭绝”。此处的情形是这样：那些兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物，因而被自我之爱和尘世之爱主宰的人完全不能接受任何神性之物。由于这个原因，他们的内在被关闭。如果他们的内在被打开，神性之物真的流入进来，那么他们将彻底被毁灭，因为他们的生命是由自我之爱和尘世之爱构成的，持续不断的对立和厌恶就存在于这些爱和天堂的爱之间，天堂的爱在于神性之物。因此，他们的生命会被神性之物的流注扼杀。以色列民族的兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物，这一点在前面已经频繁说明。</p>

Perchance I should consume thee in the way. That this signifies that if what is Divine were to flow in with this nation it would perish, is evident from the signification of "consuming," as being to 
perish. That that nation would perish if what is Divine were to flow in with them, is evident, for it is said, "I will not go up in the midst of thee; perchance I should consume thee in the way." The 
case herein is this. They who are in external things without what is internal, thus in the loves of self and of the world, cannot possibly receive anything Divine; and therefore the internal with them 
is kept closed. If the internal were opened with them, and what is Divine were to flow in, they would utterly perish; for their life is from the loves of self and of the world, and there is a perpetual 
opposition and contrariety between these loves and heavenly loves, and heavenly loves are what is Divine; and therefore their life would be extinguished by the influx of what is Divine. That the Israelitish 
nation was in external things without what is internal, thus was in these loves, has frequently been shown above. </p>

'Perchance I might consume you on the way' means that this nation would be destroyed if what is Divine were to flow in and reside with it. This is clear from the meaning of 'consuming' as being destroyed. 
It is self-evident that that nation would be destroyed if what is Divine were to flow in and reside with it, for the words that are used are, 'I will not go up in your midst, perchance I might consume 
you on the way'. The implications of this are that people whose interest lies in external things and not in what is internal, and so who are ruled by self-love and love of the world, are utterly 
incapable of receiving anything Divine. For that reason their internal is kept closed. If their internal were opened and what is Divine were to flow in they would be completely destroyed, since their 
life consists of self-love and love of the world, and unceasing opposition and repugnance exists between these loves and heavenly loves, heavenly loves consisting in what is Divine. Consequently their 
life would be snuffed out by anything Divine flowing in. The fact that the interest of the Israelite nation lay in external things and not in what was internal has been shown frequently above.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10533</b>
</p><b>10533.</b>
`Forte consumpsero te in via':  quod significet quod gens illa, si Divinum influeret apud illam, periret, constat ex significatione `consumere' quod sit perire; quod peritura gens illa si Divinum influeret 
apud illam, patet, nam dicitur, `Non ascendam in medio tui, forte consumpsero te in via.' Cum his ita se habet:  qui in externis sunt absque interno, ita in amoribus sui et mundi, plane non recipere 
possunt aliquod Divinum; quapropter internum apud illos clausum tenetur; si apud illos aperiretur internum ac influeret Divinum, prorsus perirent, vita enim eorum {1}est ex amoribus sui et mundi, 
et perpetua opposito et contrarietas est inter illos amores et inter caelestes amores, et caelestes amores sunt Divinum, quapropter ex influxu Divini exstingueretur vita eorum; quod gens Israelitica 
in externis absque interno fuerit, ita in illis amoribus, supra saepius ostensum est. @1 After mundi$ </p>
