<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10621节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10621</strong>.“背负罪孽、过犯和罪恶”表移开邪恶及其虚假，好叫它不出现。这从“背负”和“罪孽、过犯和罪恶”的含义清楚可知：“背负”是指移开某种东西，好叫它不出现，如下文所述；“罪孽、过犯和罪恶”是指邪恶。由于表示邪恶，故也表示它们的虚假，因为一切邪恶都与自己的虚假结合。至于“罪孽”表示哪种邪恶，“过犯”表示哪种邪恶，“罪恶”表示哪种邪恶，可参看9156节。“背负或拿走邪恶”邪恶之所以表示移开它，好叫它不出现，是因为存在于一个人里面的邪恶不可能从他那里被拿走，只能被移开，以至于不出现；当它们不出现时，就被视为从这个人那里拿走了。因此，圣言的字义说它们被拿走，完全被逐出。存在于一个人里面的邪恶不能被拿走，只能被移开，以至于不出现（可参看<a href="10057.htm">10057</a>e节提到的地方）。</p>

Bearing iniquity, and transgression, and sin. That this signifies the removal of evil and of its falsity so that it does not appear, is evident from the signification of "bearing" or taking away, as 
being to remove so that it does not appear (of which below); and from the signification of "iniquity, transgression, and sin," as being evils, and because evils, their falsities also, for every evil is 
conjoined with its own falsity; but what evil is signified by "iniquity," what by "transgression," and what by "sin," see at n. 9156. That "bearing" and "taking away evil" denotes to remove it so that 
it does not appear, is because the evils with man cannot be taken away, but only removed so as not to appear; and when they do not appear, it is believed that they have been taken away. Therefore in 
the sense of the letter of the Word it is said that they are taken away, and altogether cast out. (That the evils with man are not taken away, but only removed so as not to appear, may be seen at the 
places cited in n. 10057.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10621</b></p><p><b>10621.</b>
'Bearing iniquity, transgression, and sin' means shifting evil and its falsity away in order that it may not be apparent. This is clear from the meaning of 'bearing' or taking away as moving or shifting 
something in order that it may not be apparent, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'iniquity, transgression, and sin' as evils. And since evils are meant, so are the falsities that go with 
them; for every evil is wedded to its own falsity. But as for what kind of evil is meant by 'iniquity', what kind by 'transgression', and what kind by 'sin', see <a href="9156.htm">9156</a>. The reason why 'bearing' evil or 
taking it away means shifting it in order that it may not be apparent is that evils present in a person cannot be taken away from him, only shifted in order that they may not be apparent; and when they 
have been shifted they are thought to have been taken away from that person. Therefore the literal sense of the Word speaks of their having been taken away and completely banished. For the fact that 
they are merely moved or shifted in order that they may not be apparent, see in the places referred to in <a href="10057.htm">10057</a>(end).  </p>

`Ferens iniquitatem, praevaricationem, et peccatum': quod significet remotionem mali et ejus falsi ut non appareat, constat ex significatione `ferre' seu tollere, quod sit removere ut non appareat, 
de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `iniquitatis, praevaricationis, et peccati' quod sint mala, et quia sunt mala, etiam sunt eorum falsa, nam unumquodvis malum conjunctum est suo falso; sed quodnam 
malum significatur per `iniquitatem,' quodnam per `praevaricationem,' et quodnam per `peccatum,' videatur n. 9156.  Quod ferre {1}et tollere malum sit removere illud ut non appareat, est quia mala apud 
hominem non tolli possunt sed modo removeri ut non appareant, et {2}cum non apparent {3}creditur quod sublata sint; ideo in sensu litterae Verbi dicitur quod ablata et prorsus rejecta sint; quod mala 
apud hominem non auferantur sed modo removeantur ut non appareant, videatur in locis citatis n. 10057 fin. @1 aut$ @2 quia$ @3 i inde$ </p>
