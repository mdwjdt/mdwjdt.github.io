<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2102节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2102.</strong>“都在他们包皮肉上给行了割礼”表他们靠着主洁净和公义。这从“割礼”和“包皮”的含义清楚可知：“割礼”是指从我欲和物欲中洁净（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）；“包皮”是指除去这些爱（参看<a href="2041.htm">2041</a>，<a href="2053.htm">2053</a>，<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>节）。所引用的这些章节还进一步说明，这些爱是阻止主的良善与真理流入和运作的唯一障碍，并因此阻止主的公义行在人身上。<br />这一整章都在论述主神性本质与人性本质的融合，以及主凭祂现已变成神性的人性而与人的结合，还论述了割礼，即从人所具有的一切污秽中洁净。所有这些事构成一个系列，一个接着一个。事实上，主里面神性本质与人性本质的融合得以成就，目的是为了神性可以与人结合。而神性与人的结合无法实现，除非人从这些爱中洁净。一旦他从这些爱中洁净，主的神性人就会流入进来，从而将人与它自己联结起来。这表明了圣言的性质，也就是说，一旦理解了内义，圣言中的一切事物就会以得体、优美的次序全部串联起来。</p>

And circumcised the flesh of their foreskin. That this signifies their purification and righteousness from the Lord, is evident from the signification of being "circumcised," as being to be purified 
from the loves of self and of the world (explained above, n. 2039); also from the signification of "circumcising the flesh of the foreskin," as being the removal of these loves (also spoken of above, 
n. 2041, 2053, 2057; where it was further shown that those loves are the sole obstacle to the influx and operation of the good and truth from the Lord, and consequently to the application of the Lord's 
righteousness to man).  [2] This whole chapter has treated of the union of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence; and concerning the conjunction of the Lord with man by means of His Human 
Essence made Divine; and also concerning circumcision, that is, purification from the filthy things in man. All these things are in one series, and follow one from another; for the union of the Divine 
Essence with the Human Essence in the Lord was effected to the end that the Divine might be conjoined with man; and the conjunction of the Divine with man cannot be effected unless man is purified 
from those loves; but as soon as he is being purified from them, the Lord's Divine Human flows in, and thus conjoins man with itself. This shows the nature of the Word, namely, that when what is signified 
in the internal sense is understood, the Word is all connected together in a becoming and beautiful series. </p>

'And he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin' means their purification and righteousness from the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'being circumcised' as being purified from self-love and love 
of the world, dealt with above in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, and also from the meaning of 'flesh of the foreskin' as the removal of those loves, also dealt with above in <a href="2041.htm">2041</a>, <a href="2053.htm">2053</a>, <a href="2057.htm">2057</a>. It was also shown in those paragraphs 
that those loves alone are what stop the inflow and functioning of good and truth from the Lord, and so prevent the Lord's righteousness from being imparted to him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The whole of this chapter 
has dealt with the union of the Lord's Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and with the conjunction of the Lord with man by means of His Human Essence now made Divine. It has dealt also with 
circumcision, that is, with purification from all the filth residing with man. These matters constitute a single train of thought, following one after another. In fact the union of the Divine Essence 
with the Human Essence in the Lord took place to enable the Divine to be joined to man. But that conjunction of the Divine with man cannot be achieved unless man is purified from those loves. As soon 
as he is purified from them however the Lord's Divine Human flows in and in so doing joins man to Himself. This shows the nature of the Word, that is to say, when the meaning in the internal sense is 
understood everything connects together in a proper and beautiful sequence. </p>

`Et circumcidet `carnem praeputii eorum': quod significet purificationem et justitiam eorum a Domino, constat a significatione `circumcidi quod sit purificari ab amoribus sui et mundi, de qua supra 
n. 2039; (m)tum a significatione `carnis praeputii' quod sit remotio amorum istorum, de qua etiam supra n. 2041, 2053, 2057; {1} quod amores illi solum obstent quin bonum et verum a Domino influere et 
operari queant, ibi quoque ostensum est, ita quin Justitia Domini possit homini applicari.  Actum est in toto hoc capite de unione Essentiae Divinae Domini cum Humana, deque conjunctione Domini cum homine 
per Humanam Ipsius Essentiam factam Divinam, ut et de circumcisione, hoc est, de purificatione a spurcis apud hominem; haec in una serie sunt, et sequitur unum ab altero; unio enim Divinae Essentiae 
cum Humana in Domino facta est ob finem ut Divinum posset conjungi homini; sed Divini conjunctio cum homine non fieri potest nisi purificetur homo ab amoribus illis; ut primum vero ab illis purificatur, 
Divinum Domini Humanum influit, et sic conjungit hominem Sibi {2}; exinde patet quale est Verbum, nempe quod dum intelligitur quid significatur in sensu interno, sit connexum in decente et pulchra 
serie. 	@1 i omnem A.$ 	@2 i, proinde Divino.$ </p>
