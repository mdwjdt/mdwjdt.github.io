<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第426节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>426.</strong>以西结论到推罗的话进一步表明，“铁”表属世真理。以西结书中说：<br />他施人因你多有各类的财物，就作你的客商，拿银、铁、锡、铅兑换你的货物。威但人和雅完人拿纺成的线、亮铁、桂皮、菖蒲兑换你的货物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.12.htm">27:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.19.htm">19</a>）<br />从这些话以及本章上下文所述明显可知，这表属天属灵的财富。一切独有的表述、甚至所提到的名字都有某种特定含义，因为主的圣言是属灵的，不是字义的。<br />②在耶利米书：<br />谁可以折断铁，就是从北方来的铁和铜呢？因你在四境之内所犯的一切罪，我必把你的财产和宝物，白白给敌人作掠物。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.12.htm">15:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“铁和铜”表属世的真理与良善；“从北方来的”表感官和属世的，因为相对于属灵和属天，属世如同黑暗或北方，相对于光明或南方，属世则如同阴影，也就是此处母亲“洗拉”的含义。显而易见，“财产和宝物”表属天属灵的财富。<br />③以西结书：<br />你又要拿一个铁的煎盘，放在你和城的中间当作铁墙。你要面向着城，象征城要被围困，你就是围攻那城的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.3.htm">4:3</a>）<br />很明显，这里的“铁”表真理。力量属于真理，因为它不可阻挡，由于这个缘由，经上用“铁”表真理，或信之真理，因为“铁”能“打碎”和“砸碎”，正如在但以理书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.34.htm">2:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.40.htm">40</a>）中和在启示录：<br />我要赐给他权柄制伏列国；他必用铁杖辖他们，将他们如同窑户的瓦器打得粉碎。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.26.htm">2:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.27.htm">27</a>）<br />妇人生了一个男孩子，是将来要用铁杖辖管万国的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.5.htm">12:5</a>）<br />④“铁杖”就是真理，真理出于主的圣言，启示录解释了这一点：<br />我观看，见天开了。有一匹白马，骑在马上的称为诚信真实，他审判，争战，都按着公义。祂穿着溅了血的衣服；祂的名称为“神之道”。有利剑从他口中出来，可以击杀列国。他必用铁杖辖管他们（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.15.htm">15</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]426.</strong> The symbolism of iron as earthly truth is established not only by the places just cited but also by Ezekiel's words concerning Tyre:<br />Tarshish{*1} was your dealer, on account of the vastness of all your affluence; for silver, iron, tin, and lead they sold your merchandise. Dan and Javan and Meuzal for your trade goods gave polished iron; cassia and calamus were in your market. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_19" target=_top>19</a>)<br />From these verses and those before and after them in the same chapter it can be seen clearly that heavenly and spiritual riches are being symbolized and that each item named means some specific entity. So do the personal names. The Lord's Word, after all, is spiritual, not mere words.<br />[2] In Jeremiah:<br />Will anyone crush iron, iron from the north, and bronze? Your resources and treasures I will turn into plunder, [in exchange] not for a price but for all your sins. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_15_12-13" target=_top>Jeremiah 15:12-13</a>)<br />Iron and bronze stand for earthly truth and goodness. What comes from the north symbolizes the level of the senses and the earthly level, because the earthly level in respect to the spiritual and heavenly level is like northern darkness in relation to southern sunlight. Or it is like a shadow, which Zillah (Tubal-cain's mother) also symbolizes here.{*2} Plainly the resources and treasures mean heavenly, spiritual riches.<br />[3] In Ezekiel:<br />Take yourself an iron griddle and put it as an iron partition between yourself and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be for a siege, and tighten the siege against it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_4_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 4:3</a>)<br />Clearly iron symbolizes truth here. Truth is considered strong because nothing can resist it. So iron, which symbolizes truth, or the verities of faith, is said to crush and bruise, as in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_33" target=_top>Daniel 2:33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_40" target=_top>40</a>. And in John it says:<br />To those who conquer I will give authority over the nations, to shepherd them with an iron rod, as if clay pots were being crushed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_revelation_2_26-27" target=_top>Revelation 2:26-27</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />The woman delivered a male child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_revelation_12_5" target=_top>Revelation 12:5</a>)<br />[4] An iron rod is the truth in the Lord's Word, as John himself explains:<br />I saw the sky opened, when look! A white horse. And the one sitting on it was called faithful and true, and he judges and fights in justice. He was dressed in a garment dyed with blood, and his name is called God's Word. From his mouth issues a sharp saber, and with it he will strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_revelation_19_11" target=_top>Revelation 19:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_revelation_19_13" target=_top>13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/bible_king-james-version_revelation_19_15" target=_top>15</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the place called Tarshish, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_426/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_117" target=_top>117</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} The name Zillah itself also means "shadow." In identifying the north with darkness and the south with light, Swedenborg presumes a readership in the northern hemisphere. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 426</b></p><p><b>426.</b>
That "iron" signifies natural truth, is further evident from what Ezekiel says of Tyre: </p>
<p>     Tarshish was thy trader by reason of the multitude of all riches; in silver, iron, tin, and lead, they gave 
thy traffickings. Dan, and Javan, and Meusal furnished bright iron in thy tradings; cassia and calamus were in thy mart (Ezek. 27:12, 19). From these words, as well as from what is said both previously 
and subsequently in the same chapter, it is very evident that celestial and spiritual riches are signified; and that every particular expression, and even the names mentioned, have some specific 
signification, for the Word of the Lord is spiritual, and not verbal.  [2] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass? Thy substance [facultates] and thy treasures will 
I give for a spoil without price, and this for all thy sins (Jer. 15:12-13), where "iron" and "brass" signify natural truth and good; that it came from the "north" signifies what is sensuous and natural; 
for what is natural, relatively to what is spiritual and celestial, is like thick darkness (that is, the "north") relatively to light or the "south;" or like shade, which is also signified here 
by "Zillah" who is the "mother." That the "substance" and "treasures" are celestial and spiritual riches, is also very evident.  [3] Again in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Take thou unto thee a pan of iron, and set 
it for a wall of iron between thee and the city, and set thy faces toward it, and let it be for a siege, and thou shalt straiten against it (Ezek. 4:3),where also it is evident that "iron" signifies 
truth. Strength is attributed to truth, because it cannot be resisted, and for this reason it is said of iron-by which is signified truth, or the truth of faith-that it "breaks in pieces" and "crushes"; 
as in Daniel (2:34, 40), and in John: </p>
<p>     He that overcometh, to him will I give sovereign power over the nations, that he may pasture them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall 
they be broken to shivers (Rev. 2:26-27). Again: </p>
<p>     The woman brought forth a man child, who should pasture all nations with a rod of iron (Rev. 12:5). [4] That a "rod of iron" is the truth which 
is of the Word of the Lord, is explained in John: </p>
<p>     I saw heaven open, and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He doth judge and fight; 
He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and His name is called the Word of God; out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations; and He shall pasture them with 
a rod of iron (Rev. 19:11, 13, 15). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 426</b></p><p><b>426.</b>
As regards 'iron' meaning natural truth, this is clear from the places quoted already, and from the following as well: In Ezekiel in reference to Tyre, </p>
<blockquote>
Tarshish was your trader because of the vastness 
of all your wealth - in silver, iron, tin, and lead they provided Your wares. Dan and Javan, and Meusal, exchanged wrought iron in your tradings; cassla and calamus were in your market. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:12,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:12, 19</a>.   
</blockquote>
From these verses, and from those before and after them in the same chapter, it is quite clear that celestial and spiritual riches are meant. Each commodity, and also each name mentioned 
there, has some specific meaning, for the Word of the Lord is spiritual and not just verbal in content.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Can one smash iron, iron from the north, and bronze? Your resources and 
your treasures I will give as spoil, without price, even for all your sins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2015:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 15:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'iron' and 'bronze' stand for natural truth and good. 'That which comes from the north' means that 
which is sensory and natural, for natural in comparison with spiritual and celestial is as thick darkness or the north to light or the south. The natural also resembles shade, which is also the meaning 
here of 'Zillah' who was the mother. It is also quite plain that 'resources and treasures' are celestial and spiritual riches.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Ezekiel,   Take an iron pan and place it as an iron wall 
between you and the city, and set your face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> towards it, and let it be in a state of siege, and oppress it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%204:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 4:3</a>.  </p>
<p>Here too it is clear that 'iron' means truth. Great strength is attributed to 
truth because nothing is able to withstand it. This in addition is why iron, which means truth, that is, the truth of faith, is referred to as smashing and crushing to pieces, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:33,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:33, 40</a>. And 
in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who overcomes, to him will I give power over the nations to rule<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> them with an iron rod as when earthen pots are broken in pieces. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%202:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 2:26, 27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
The woman 
gave birth to a male child, who was to rule<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> all nations with an iron rod. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The explanation appears in John that an 'iron rod' means truth which belongs to the Word of the Lord, 
 </p>
<p>I saw heaven opened, when behold, a white horse! And He who sat upon it was called faithful and true, and in righteousness He judges and fights. He was clothed in a robe dipped in blood and His name 
is called the Word of God. From His mouth issues a sharp sword, and with it He will smite the nations, and will rule<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> them with an iron rod. Rev. <a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>, <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>.

</p><b>426.</b>
Quod 'ferrum' significet verum naturale, praeter ab illis quae allata sunt, etiam constat apud Ezechielem de Tyro, 	Tarshish negotiatrix tua, prae multitudine omnis affluentiae, in argento, ferro, 
stanno et plumbo, dederunt mercaturas tuas: </p>
<p>	Dan et Javan, et Meusal {1}, in negotiationibus tuis dederunt ferrum tersum; casia et calamus in foro tuo fuit, xxvii 12, 19; </p>
<p>ex his et quae praecedunt et 
sequuntur in eodem capite, constat manifeste quod significentur divitiae caelestes et spirituales, et quod per singula quae nominantur, aliquid speciale; tum etiam per nomina; nam Verbum Domini est 
spirituale non verbale:  [2] apud Jeremiam, 	Num conteret ferrum, ferrum a septentrione et aes? facultates tuas et thesauros in praedam dabo, non in pretio, et quidem pro omnibus peccatis His, xv 12, 
13; </p>
<p>ubi 'ferrum et aes' pro vero et bono naturali; 'quod venit a septentrione' significat sensuale et naturale, nam naturale respective ad spirituale et caeleste est sicut caligo seu septentrio ad lucem 
aut meridiem;' aut sicut umbra, quam significat quoque 'Zillah' {2} hic, quae mater: quod 'facultates et thesauri' sint divitiae caelestes et spirituales, etiam manifeste patet: [3] apud Ezechielem, 	Accipe 
tibi sartaginem ferri; et da eam parietem ferri, inter te et inter urbem, et disponas facies tuas ad eam, et sit in obsidionem, et angustes contra eam, iv 3; </p>
<p>quod per 'ferrum' hic significetur 
veritas, etiam constat; veritati tribuitur robur quia ei non resisti potest, quare etiam praedicatur de ferro, quo significatur veritas seu verum fidei, quod confringat et contundat; ut apud Dan. 
ii 33, 40; et apud Johannem, 	Qui vicerit,... illi dabo potestatem super gentes, illi pascat {4} eas virga ferrea; sicut vasa figulinorum {3} conterantur, Apoc.ii 26,27: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Mulier peperit 
filium masculum, qui pasturus4 erit omnes gentes virga ferrea, Apoc. xii 5; </p>
<p>[4]	quod 'virga ferrea' sit veritas quae est Verbi Domini, apud Johannem explicatur, 	Vidi caelum apertam, cum ecce equus 
albus, et qui sedens super illo, vocabatur fidelis et verus, qui in justitia judicat pugnat;... indutus erat vestimento tincto sanguine, vocaturque nomen ejus Verbum Dei,... ex ore illius exit romphaea: 
acuta, et per illam percutiet gentes, ac ille  {4} pascet eos virga ferrea Apoc. xix 11, 13, 15. @	1 The Heb. here is doubtful.  In 3923 S. has Dan et Javan, adveniens in nundinis tuis, in 10256 
and 10258 he has Dan et Javan netum in negotiationibus tuis.  R.V. has 'traded with yarn' or in m. traded from Uzal. R.V. has Vedan for Dan, but the existence of such a place seems doubtful.$ @	2 
Heb.   (zillah) means 'screen,' or 'shade.'$ @	3 In 4876 and A.R. S. has figulina; in A.E. fictilia.$ @	4 Gk. is poimaino = 'to shepherd,' hence 'feed, guide or rule.' The usual verb for 'rule' is 
hegeomai. Cf. Matt. ii 6, R.V.$ </p>
