<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3627节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3627.</strong>这是一个普遍规则，即：没有任何事物能通过自己存在并持续存在，而是要通过其它事物，确实地说，要经由其它事物，并且任何事物若不通过，确切地说，经由其它事物，就无法被保持在一个形式中，这一点从自然界中的每一个事物明显看出来。众所周知，人体通过大气的包围而从外部被保持在形式中；它若不通过某种主动力或生命力从内部被保持在形式中，就会立刻崩溃，散成碎片。因为一切事物若不与先于自身之物，并经由这在先之物而与主相联，就会瞬间消亡。大人，或来自它的流注，就是那在先之物。人就其每一部分而言，通过这在先之物与那首先的，就是主相联，这一点从下文清楚可知。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3627</b></p><p><b>3627.</b>
It is a general rule that nothing can exist and subsist from itself, but from something else, that is, through something else, and that nothing can be kept in form except from, that is, through it, as 
is evident from each and everything in nature. That on the outside the human body is kept in form by the atmospheres, is known; and unless it were also kept in form within by some acting or living force, 
it would fall to pieces in a moment; for everything unconnected with what is prior to itself, and through things prior with the First, instantly perishes. That the Grand Man, or influx therefrom, 
is that prior by which man as to each and all things in him is connected with the First, that is, with the Lord, will appear from what follows. </p>

It is a general principle that nothing can come into being and be kept in being from itself but from, or rather through, something other than itself, and that nothing can be held together within a form 
except from, or rather through, something other, as is clear from every single thing in the natural system. The human body is held together in form by the surrounding atmospheres from without, as is 
well known; and if it were not also held together by some active or living force from within it would instantly fall apart. Anything unconnected to something prior to itself, and through things that 
are prior is not connected to that which is First, perishes in an instant. The Grand Man, or influx from it, is that prior something through which the human being - every single part of him - is connected 
to that which is First, that is, to the Lord, as will be evident from what follows below. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3627</b>
</p><b>3627.</b>
Regula communis est quod nihil existere et subsistere possit ex se sed ex (x)alio, hoc est, per aliud, et quod nihil contineri in forma queat nisi ex alio, hoc est, per aliud, sicut constat ex omnibus 
et singulis in natura: quod corpus humanum extrinsecus contineatur in forma ab atmosphaeris, notum est, nisi intrinsecus etiam contineretur ab aliqua vi agente seu viva, momento collaberetur: omne inconnexum 
a priore se, et per priora a Primo, in instanti perit: quod Maximus Homo, seu influxus inde, sit illud prius, per quod connectitur homo quoad omnia et singula ejus cum Primo, hoc est, cum Domino, 
ex sequentibus {1}patebit. @1 constabit$
