<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3393.</strong>“亚比米勒召了以撒来，说”表主来自教义的直觉。这从“亚比米勒”和“以撒”的代表，以及“说”的含义清楚可知：“亚比米勒”是指关注理性事物的教义（<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>，<a href="2533.htm">2533</a>，<a href="3391.htm">3391</a>节）；“以撒”是指主的神圣理性，如前所述；“说”是指发觉（<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2080.htm">2080</a>，<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>节）。由于“亚比米勒”表神性在其中被察觉的教义（<a href="3392.htm">3392</a>节），故亚比米勒也代表主的教义。因为就至高意义而言，圣言中的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，都涉及主。事实上，不仅在至高意义上，而且在内义，甚至字义上，主就是教义本身，也就是圣言。因为字义是内义的代表和有意义的符号，而内义则是至高意义的代表和有意义的符号。在圣言中，一切代表或有意义的符号本质上都是所代表和表示之物，因此是主的神性。因为一个代表无非就是被代表之人的一个形像，该形像含有被呈为可见的那一位在自己里面。这一点从一个人的言谈举止可以看出来；也就是说，其言谈举止只不过是从这个人里面，就是从他的思维和意愿里面所涌现出的事物的形像；以致言谈举止就是以外在形式来表达的思维和意愿。倘若从言谈举止中拿走思维和意愿，所剩下的，只是毫无生命的事，因而根本没有人性之物。由此可见圣言的性质，即它是神性，甚至在文字上也是神性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3393</b></p><p><b>3393.</b>
And Abimelech called Isaac, and said. That this signifies the Lord's perception from doctrine, is evident from the representation of Abimelech, as being the doctrine that looks to rational things (n. 
2504, 2509, 2510, 2533, 3391); and from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord's Divine rational (of which above); and from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (n. 1898, 1919, 
2080, 2862). And as "Abimelech" signifies that doctrine in which the Divine was now perceived (n. 3392), therefore by Abimelech is also represented the Lord as to that doctrine. For in the supreme sense 
all things in the Word in both general and particular have relation to the Lord; and the Lord is doctrine itself, that is, the Word, not only as to the supreme sense therein, but also as to the internal 
sense, and even as to the literal sense, for this sense is representative and significative of the internal sense, and the internal sense is representative and significative of the supreme sense; 
and that which in the Word is representative and significative is in its essence that which is represented and signified, thus it is the Divine of the Lord; for a representative is nothing but an image 
of him who is represented; and is in an image the Lord Himself presented to view. This may be seen from man's speech, and also from his gesture, these being merely images of the things which come 
forth within the man, in his thought and will; so that the speech and gesture are the thought and will in form; for if you take away from them the thought and will, that which is left is a mere inanimate 
affair, thus nothing human. This shows how the case is with the Word, even in the letter, namely, that it is Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3393</b></p><p><b>3393.</b>
'And Abimelech called Isaac and said' means the Lord's perception from doctrine. This is clear from the representation of 'Abimelech' as doctrine which has regard to rational concepts, dealt with in <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>, <a href="2533.htm">2533</a>, <a href="3391.htm">3391</a>; from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Lord's Divine Rational, dealt with above; and from the meaning of 'laying' as perceiving, dealt with in <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2080.htm">2080</a>, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>. 
And because 'Abimelech' means that doctrine, in which the Divine was now perceived, <a href="3392.htm">3392</a>, Abimelech also represents the Lord in regard to that doctrine. For every single thing in the Word refers in the 
highest sense to the Lord. Indeed the Lord is doctrine itself, that is, the Word, not only as to the highest sense there, but also as to the internal sense, and even as to the literal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
For the literal sense is the representative of, and carries all that is meant in the internal sense, and the internal sense in turn is representative of and carries all that is meant in the highest sense 
In the Word every representative or meaningful sign is in essence that which is represented or meant by it, and for that reason is the Lord's Divine. For a representative is nothing else than an image 
of the one who is being represented, and the image holds within itself the one who is presented. This may be seen from a person's speech and also from his gestures; that is to say, his speech and 
gestures are merely images of the things that are going on inwardly in that person's thought and will, so that speech and gestures are the thought and will expressed in outward form. Take away thought 
and will from them and you would be left with something wholly lifeless, and so with nothing human at all. From this one may see the true nature of the Word - that it is Divine, even in the letter. </p>

`Et vocabat Abimelech Jishakum, et dixit': quod significet Domini perceptionem ex doctrina, constat ex repraesentatione `Abimelechi' quod sit doctrina spectans rationalia, de qua n. 2504, 2509, 2510, 
2533, 3391; ex repraesentatione `Jishaki' quod sit Divinum Rationale Domini, de qua supra; et ex significatione `dicere' quod sit percipere, de qua n. 1898, 1919, 2080, 2862; et quia Abimelech significat 
doctrinam illam, in qua nunc Divinum perceptum est, n. 3392, ita per `Abimelechum' etiam repraesentatur Dominus quoad illam; nam omnia et singula quae in Verbo in supremo sensu se referunt ad Dominum; 
estque Dominus ipsa doctrina, hoc est, Verbum, non modo quoad sensum supremum ibi, sed etiam quoad sensum internum, etiam quoad sensum litteralem, [2] hic enim sensus est repraesentativus et significativus 
sensus interni, et hic repraesentativus et significativus sensus supremi; et quod in Verbo repraesentativum et significativum est, hoc in essentia sua est illud {1}quod repraesentatur et 
significatur, ita est Divinum Domini; repraesentativum enim non est nisi imago illius qui repraesentatur, et in imagine est ipse qui sistitur; ut patere potest a loquela hominis, etiam a gestu ejus; illa 
nempe loquela et hic nempe gestus sunt modo imagines illorum quae existunt intus in homine, in ejus cogitatione et voluntate, sic ut loquela et gestus sint cogitatio et voluntas in forma {2}; si enim 
cogitationem et voluntatem inde auferres, reliquum foret modo inanimatum quid, ita nihil humani; inde constare potest quomodo se habet cum Verbo, etiam in littera, quod nempe Divinum sit. @1 i ipsum$
