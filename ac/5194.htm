<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5194.</strong>“过了两年的天数”表结合的状态之后，也就是说，当属于外层属世层的感官能力和属于内层属世层的感官能力结合之时，前一章论述了这两种感官能力。这从“两年的天数”或两年的时间的含义清楚可知，“两年的天数”或两年的时间是指结合的状态；因为“两”表示结合（参看<a href="1686.htm">1686</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节），而“年”，和“天”一样，表示状态。“年”具有这样的含义从前面也可以看出来（<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）；“天”也具有这样的含义（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>节）。“两或二”之所以表示结合，是因为在灵界，因而在自然界，每一个事物都与两样事物或两种力量有关，即良善与真理。良善是一种主动并流入的力量，真理是一种被动并接受的力量。而且，由于一切事物都与这二者有关，若非这二者通过某种婚姻的形像构成一体，就无物产生，所以“两或二”表示结合。<br />这样一种婚姻形像就存在于自然界及其三个王国的每一个事物里面；没有这种婚姻，凡物都不能存在。为使事物在自然界中存在，必须有热和光存在；自然界的热对应于灵界的爱之良善，自然界的光对应于灵界的信之真理。若要产生某种事物，这二者，即热和光必须行如一体。如果它们没有行如一体，如冬天里的情形，根本就不会产生任何事物。这在属灵层面也是如此，这一点从人的情形很明显地看出来。人拥有两种官能，即意愿和理解力。意愿得以形成是为了接受属灵之热，也就是爱与仁之良善；而理解力得以形成是为了接受属灵之光，也就是信之真理。除非这二者在人里面构成一体，否则无物产生；因为没有信之真理的爱之良善无法定义任何事物，或赋予它特定性质；而没有爱之良善的信之真理则无法将任何事物带入结果。因此，为使天上的婚姻能存在于人里面，或为使人能处于天上的婚姻，这二者必须在他里面构成一体。这解释了为何古人将世界的每一个事物和人里面的每一个事物比作一个婚姻（<a href="54.htm">54</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="568.htm">568</a>，<a href="718.htm">718</a>，<a href="747.htm">747</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>，<a href="1432.htm">1432</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2731.htm">2731</a>，<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>，<a href="2758.htm">2758</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>，<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>，<a href="5138.htm">5138</a>节）。由此明显可知为何“两或二”表示结合。</p>

And it came to pass from the end of two years of days. That this signifies after a state of conjunction of the sensuous things of the exterior natural with things of the interior natural, which has been 
treated of in the preceding chapter, is evident from the signification of "two years of days," or of the time of two years, as being states of conjunction; for "two" signifies conjunction (see n. 
1686, 3519), and "years," as also "days," signify states. (That "years" have this signification can also be seen above, n. 487, 488, 493, 893; and also "days," n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 2788, 3462, 3785, 
4850.) That "two" signifies conjunction is because all things in general and in particular in the spiritual world, and consequently in the natural world, have reference to two things, namely, good and 
truth-to good as what acts and flows in, and to truth as what suffers and receives; and because they have reference to these two, and nothing is produced unless the two make a one by a certain image 
of marriage, therefore conjunction is signified by "two."  [2] Such an image of marriage is in all and each of the things of nature and its three kingdoms, and without it nothing whatever comes forth; 
for in order that anything may come forth in nature, there must be heat and light-heat in the natural world corresponding to the good of love in the spiritual world, and light corresponding to the truth 
of faith. These two, heat and light, must act as a one if anything is to be produced; and if they do not act as a one, as in winter time, nothing at all is produced. That this is also true spiritually, 
is very plain in the case of man. Man has two faculties, the will and the understanding, the will being formed to receive spiritual heat, that is, the good of love and of charity, and the understanding 
to receive spiritual light, that is, the truth of faith. Unless these two make a one in man nothing is produced; for the good of love without the truth of faith does not determine or qualify 
anything, and the truth of faith without the good of love does not effect anything; and therefore in order that the heavenly marriage may be in a man, or that he may be in the heavenly marriage, these 
two must make a one in him. For this reason the ancients compared to marriages one and all of the things in the world, and also in man (n. 54, 55, 568, 718, 747, 917, 1432, 2173, 2516, 2731, 2739, 2758, 
3132, 4434, 4823, 5138). From this it is evident why "two" signifies conjunction. </p>

'And it happened at the end of two years of days' means after the state when the joining together took place, that is to say, when the powers of the senses belonging to the exterior natural and those 
belonging to the interior natural were joined together, both of which powers are dealt with in the previous chapter. This is clear from the meaning of 'two years of days', that is, a period of two years, 
as a state involving a joining together; for 'two' means a joining together, <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, while 'years' means states, as does 'days'. For the meaning of years' as states, see <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, and 
for that of 'days', <a href="27.htm">27</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="497.htm">497</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>. The reason 'two' means a joining together is that every single thing in the spiritual world, and consequently in the natural world, has 
two forces associated with it - goodness and truth. Good is an active inflowing force, truth a passive, recipient one. Also, because everything has these two forces associated with it, and because nothing 
can ever be brought forth unless the two are made one by becoming so to speak married to each other, a joining together is therefore meant by them. </p>

 This type of marriage exists in every 
single thing within the natural order and its three kingdoms; without it nothing whatever can come into existence. For anything to come into existence within the natural order there needs to be heat and 
light, heat in the natural world corresponding to the good of love in the spiritual world, and light corresponding to the truth of faith. These two - heat and light - must act as one if anything is 
to be brought forth. If they do not act as one, as is the case in winter-time, nothing at all is brought forth. The same holds true on a spiritual level, as is quite evident with the human being, who 
has two mental powers - will and understanding. The will has been formed so that it may receive spiritual heat, that is, the good of love and charity, while the understanding has been formed so that 
it may receive spiritual light, that is, the truth of faith. Unless these two residing with a person make one nothing is brought forth, for the good of love devoid of the truth of faith cannot give definition 
and particular character to anything, while the truth of faith devoid of the good of love cannot bring anything into effect. So that the heavenly marriage may exist in a person therefore, or 
rather so that a person may be in the heavenly marriage, those two entities must make one in him. This explains why the ancients likened every single thing in the world, and every single thing within 
the human being, to a marriage, <a href="54.htm">54</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="568.htm">568</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>, <a href="747.htm">747</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="1432.htm">1432</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2731.htm">2731</a>, <a href="2739.htm">2739</a>, <a href="2758.htm">2758</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, <a href="4875.htm">4875</a>, <a href="5138.htm">5138</a>. From all this one may see why it is that 'two' means a joining together. </p>

`Et factum a fine biennii dierum': quod significet post   statum conjunctionis, nempe sensualium quae sunt naturalis exterioris cum illis quae sunt naturalis interioris, de quibus in capite praecedente 
actum est, constat a significatione `biennii dierum,' seu temporis duorum annorum, quod sint status conjunctionis, `binum' enim seu `duo' significant conjunctionem, n. 1686, 3519, et `anni', tum quoque 
`dies', significant {1}status; quod anni, videatur n. 487, 488, 493, 893; quod dies, n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850. Quod `duo'   significent conjunctionem est quia omnia et singula 
quae in spirituali mundo, et inde quae in naturali, se referunt ad duo, nempe ad bonum et verum, ad bonum ut ad agens et influens, et ad verum ut ad patiens et recipiens, et quia se referunt ad illa 
duo, et nihil usquam producitur nisi duo illa unum fiunt per quoddam instar conjugii, inde est quod per duo significetur conjunctio; [2] tale instar conjugii est in omnibus et singulis naturae ac trium 
ejus regnorum; absque illo nihil quicquam existit; ut enim aliquid existat in natura, erit calor et lux; calor in naturali mundo correspondet bono amoris in spirituali mundo, et lux correspondet vero 
fidei; illa duo, nempe calor et lux, unum agent si aliquid producendum; at si non unum agunt, ut fit tempore hiemis, nihil prorsus producitur; quod spiritualiter se quoque ita habeat, patet manifeste 
apud hominem; sunt duae facultates apud hominem, nempe voluntas et intellectus; voluntas formata est ad recipiendum calorem spiritualem, hoc est, bonum amoris et charitatis; et intellectus ad recipiendum 
lucem spiritualem, hoc est, verum fidei; illa duo apud hominem nisi {2}unum faciant, nihil producitur, bonum enim amoris absque vero fidei non aliquid determinat et qualificat, et verum fidei absque 
bono amoris non aliquid efficit; quapropter, ut in homine sit conjugium caeleste, seu is in conjugio caelesti, duo illa facient unum apud illum; inde est quod antiqui omnia et singula in mundo, 
et omnia et singula apud hominem, assimilaverint conjugiis, n. 54, 55, 568, 718, 747, 917, 1432, 2173, 2516, 2731, 2739, 2758, 3132, 4434, (x)4835, 5138. Ex his constare potest unde est quod `duo' significent 
conjunctionem. @1 statum$ @2 duo I$ </p>
