<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8456节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8456.</strong>“那层露水上升之后”表真理的引入。这从“上升”和“露水”的含义：“上升”在此是指被驱散，因而看不见；“露水”是指平安的真理，如刚才所述。吗哪上的这层露水表示真理的引入，因为平安的真理就是从主发出并存在于天堂的神性真理。这是至内层，它将自己引入在它之下的真理，并赋予这真理以生命，正如露水通常使它早晨落于其上的青草或庄稼具有生气。当下面的真理被它赋予生命时，平安的真理就上升，也就是说，它似乎不再在那里；唯有从它接受生命的真理显现。这就是信之真理如何生出的；因为包含在教义或圣言中的真理不会变成与人同的真理，除非它从神性接受生命。它通过从主发出、被称为平安真理的真理的引入接受这生命。这真理不是信之真理，而是信之真理的生命或灵魂。它将在被称为“信之真理”的真理里面的一切事物组织成一个天堂的形式，之后又使这些真理本身彼此关联。由此可见，当真理的引入通过平安的真理在人里面进行时会发生什么。此外，要知道，正在重生之人的低层或外层依次从高层或内层接受生命；因此，信之真理从平安的真理接受生命；平安的真理从主自己接受生命。来自主的生命被引入那些正在重生的人是按着从主降下的连续阶段实现的，也就是说，通过至内在部分，进而通过内层降至外层。所以对已经重生的人来说，有一条路是敞开的，直到主那里；但对没有重生的人来说，这条路是关闭的。</p>

And the deposit of dew went up. That this signifies the insinuation of truth, is evident from the signification of "going up," as here being to be dissipated, and thus not to appear to the sight; and 
from the signification of "the dew," as being the truth of peace (of which just above). The deposit of this upon the manna signifies the insinuation of truth; for the truth of peace is the Divine truth 
proceeding from the Lord in heaven, which being the inmost insinuates itself into the truth which is beneath, and vivifies it, as the dew is wont to vivify the grass or growing crop upon which it falls 
in the morning. When the truth which is beneath has been vivified by it, then the truth of peace goes up, that is, as to appearance ceases, and the truth which had received life from it comes into 
view. Thus is born the truth of faith. For no truth of doctrine or of the Word becomes truth with man until it has received life from the Divine, and it receives life through the insinuation of the 
truth which proceeds from the Lord, which is called "the truth of peace." This truth is not the truth of faith, but it is the life or soul of the truth of faith, and it disposes into the heavenly form 
all things which are in the truth that is called "the truth of faith," and afterward it also disposes the truths themselves one with another. From all this it can be seen how the case is with the insinuation 
of truth with man by means of the truth of peace. Be it also known that the lower or exterior things with the man who is being regenerated receive life in succession from the higher or interior 
things; thus the truth of faith from the truth of peace; and the truth of peace from the Lord Himself. The insinuation of life from the Lord with those who are being regenerated is effected in successive 
order by Him, thus through what is inmost, and so through interior things to exterior. Consequently with the regenerated there is a way opened even from the Lord; but with those who are not regenerated 
the way is closed. </p>

'And the deposit of dew went up' means an introduction of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up' here as being dispersed and so not appearing to view; and from the meaning of 'dew' as the 
truth of peace, dealt with immediately above The deposit of dew onto the manna means an introduction of truth, for the truth of peace is Divine Truth that goes forth from the Lord and is present in 
heaven. This being inmost, it introduces itself into the truth underneath it and gives it life, as dew usually enlivens grass or crops on which it settles in the morning When the truth underneath is given 
life by it the truth of peace goes up; that is, it no longer seems to be there; only the truth that has received life from it is to be seen. This is how the truth of faith is born; for no truth contained 
in doctrine or in the Word becomes a truth residing with a person until it has received life from the Divine. It receives that life through the introduction of truth that goes forth from the 
Lord, called the truth of peace. This truth is not the truth of faith; rather it is the life or soul of the truth of faith. It organizes into a heavenly form everything within the truth which is called 
the truth of faith, and also after that the truths themselves in relation to each other. All this goes to show what happens when the introduction of truth by means of the truth of peace takes place 
in a person. It should in addition be recognized that the lower or more external levels of a person who is being regenerated receive life from higher or more internal levels in order, so that the truth 
of faith receives life from the truth of peace, and this from the Lord Himself. Life from the Lord is introduced into those who are being regenerated in consecutive stages coming down from Him, that 
is, down through the inmost part and so through interior levels into exterior. With those who have been regenerated therefore the way lies open right through to the Lord, but with those who have not 
been regenerated it is closed. </p>

`Et {1}ascendit positio roris': quod significet veri insinuationem, constat ex significatione `ascendere' quod {2}hic sit dissipari et sic ad conspectum non apparere, et ex significatione `roris' quod 
sit verum pacis, de qua mox supra; positio hujus super mannam significat insinuationem veri, nam verum pacis est Divinum Verum a Domino procedens in caelo; hoc quia intimum est, se insinuat in verum 
quod infra {3} est et vivificat illud, sicut ros solet gramen aut segetem super quam mane cadit; cum verum quod infra est ab illo vivificatum est, tunc verum pacis ascendit, hoc est, quoad apparentiam 
desinit, et conspicitur verum quod ab illo vitam acceperat; ita nascitur verum fidei, nam omne verum doctrinae seu Verbi non {4}fit verum apud hominem, priusquam a Divino acceperat vitam, et vitam 
accipit per insinuationem veri quod a Domino procedit, quod vocatur verum pacis; hoc verum non est verum fidei, sed est vita seu anima veri fidei, (c)et disponit omnia quae in vero, quod verum fidei vocatur, 
in formam caelestem, et quoque postea ipsa vera inter se; ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum insinuatione veri apud hominem per verum pacis.  Sciendum etiam est quod inferiora seu exteriora 
apud hominem qui regeneratur vitam accipiant a superioribus seu interioribus successive, ita verum fidei a vero pacis, et hoc ab Ipso Domino; insinuatio vitae a Domino apud illos qui regenerantur 
fit in ordine successivo ab Ipso, ita per intimum, et sic per interiora ad exteriora; inde apud regeneratos apertum est usque a Domino, at apud illos qui non {5}regenerati sunt est clausum. 	@1 d
