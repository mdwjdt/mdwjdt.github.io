<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1690节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1690.</strong>“其余的人都都逃到山上去了”表并非它们全部。这无需解释，从以下事实清楚可知：有一些残余逃离了。就内义而言，所论述的主题是主在童年时所经历的试探，对此，新约中没有任何记载。除了在旷野中或从旷野出来后不久的试探，以及后来在客西马尼和此后的最后一次试探外，新约没有记载任何试探。主自童年早期直到其在世时生命最后一小时的生活就在于不断的试探和不断的得胜。这从旧约中的许多地方清楚可知；在旷野中对祂的试探从未停止，这从路加福音中的以下经文清楚可知：<br />魔鬼用完了各样的试探，就暂时离开耶稣。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.13.htm">4:13</a>）<br />这也可从以下事实清楚看出来：祂一直受试探，甚至直到十字架受死，因而直到其在世生命的最后一刻。故显然，主在世时的整个生活，从祂童年时期开始，就是不断试探和不断得胜。最后的试探发生在祂在十字架上为祂的仇敌，因而为全世界所有人祷告之时。<br />在描述主生活的部分圣言中，如在福音书，除了祂在旷野的试探外，只提及最后一次试探。除了这次试探外再没有给门徒透露更多。从字义上看，所透露出来的事看似轻描淡写，以至于几乎算不上事。因为一说一答的方式并非试探，然而，祂的试探比人类心智所能理解和想象的还要严厉。若非亲身经历，没人知道何为试探。马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.11.htm">11</a>）、马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">13</a>）和路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.13.htm">13</a>）所记载的试探概括地包含了一切试探。也就是说，主出于对整个人类的爱，与充满整个地狱的我欲和物欲争战。<br />一切试探都是对存在于人里面的爱的攻击，试探的程度取决于爱的程度。若这爱不被攻击，就不存在试探。摧毁人的爱就是摧毁他的生命，因为爱就是生命。主的生命就是对整个人类的爱，事实上极其浩大，并具有这样的性质，即除了纯粹的爱外，它什么也不是。自主童年早期直到其在世时生命的最后一小时，针对祂的这种生命的试探就不断被许可，如前所述。“祂饿了，魔鬼对祂说，你若是神的儿子，可以吩咐这块石头变成食物。耶稣回答说，人活着不是单靠食物，乃是靠　神口里所出的一切话”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.4.htm">4</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.4.htm">4</a>）就表示这种爱，也就是主的真生命。下面这段经文则表示祂与物欲，或属于物欲的一切争战：<br />这一切权柄、荣华，我都要给你，因为这原是交付我的，我愿意给谁就给谁。你若在我面前下拜，这都要归你。耶稣回答说，撒但，退去吧。当拜主你的神，单要事奉祂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.5.htm">4:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.8.htm">8</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.8.htm">4:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.10.htm">10</a>）<br />以下这些话表示祂与我欲和构成我欲的一切争战：<br />魔鬼就带祂进了圣城，叫祂站在殿顶上，对祂说，你若是神的儿子，可以跳下去，因为经上记着说，主要为你吩咐祂的使者，用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上。耶稣对他说，经上又记着说，不可试探主你的神。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.5.htm">4:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.7.htm">7</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.9.htm">4:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.12.htm">12</a>）<br />试探之后有天使来伺候祂（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.11.htm">4:11</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">1:13</a>），这表示不断得胜。<br />总之，主自童年早期直到其在世时生命的最后一小时，都受到所有地狱的攻击。这些地狱不断被祂击败、征服和战胜；祂这样做唯独出于对整个人类的爱。由于这爱不是人的，而是神的，且由于这爱有多伟大，试探就有多严重，故显而易见，祂的争战何等严厉，地狱那一方何等残暴。我确切地知道，所有这一切都是千真万确的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1690.</strong> The rest fled into the mountain means that not all of them were conquered, as can be seen without explanation from the fact that the ones who escaped survived.<br />The inner meaning speaks of the trials the Lord endured when he was young. Not a word is said about them in the New Testament Scriptures but only about his crisis in the wilderness (or just after he came out of the wilderness) and finally about his last crisis, which began in Gethsemane.<br />From his early youth up to the last hour of his life in the world, the Lord's life was one continuous struggle and one continuous victory, as many passages in the Old Testament Word indicate. The Lord's trials did not end with the test he faced in the wilderness, as these words in Luke show:<br />After the Devil had finished all his testing [of Jesus], he left Jesus alone for a while. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_13" target=_top>Luke 4:13</a>)<br />The same thing can be seen from the consideration that the Lord was tested up till his death on the cross and so till the last hour of his life in the world. This evidence makes it clear that the Lord's whole life in the world, from early youth on, consisted of constant trials and constant victories, the last of which occurred on the cross when he prayed for his enemies and so for everyone everywhere in the world.<br />[2] The Word's description of the Lord's life in the Gospels mentions none of his trials outside his final crisis, except for the one he faced in the wilderness. No more was revealed to the disciples. What was revealed seems so mild that it hardly amounts to anything, as far as the literal story goes; to speak and answer in that way is no trial.{*1} The fact is, though, that he was tested more severely than any human mind could ever grasp or believe. No one can know what a spiritual crisis is like except the person who has lived through one. The trial mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_1-11" target=_top>Matthew 4:1-11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_mark_1_12-13" target=_top>Mark 1:12-13</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_1-13" target=_top>Luke 4:1-13</a> sums up all the Lord's trials, which consisted in his battling the self-love and materialism that filled the hells, out of love for the entire human race.<br />[3] All trials target the love we feel. The severity of the trial matches the nobility of the love. If love is not the target, there is no trial. To destroy a person's love is to destroy the core of that person's life, since love is life. The Lord's life was love for the whole human race, a love so great and good that it was pure, unalloyed love. He allowed this life of his to be attacked continuously, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1661:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676" target=_top>1676</a>], from the dawn of his youth until his final moments in the world.<br />Love, which was the absolute core of the Lord's life, is symbolized by this:<br />He was hungry, and the Devil said, "If you are the Son of God, say to this stone that it should become bread." And Jesus answered, "It is written, ‘Humankind is not to live by bread alone but by every word of God.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_2-3" target=_top>Luke 4:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_4" target=_top>4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_2" target=_top>Matthew 4:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />[4] He fought against materialism and everything bearing its stamp, as symbolized by these words:<br />The Devil led him up onto a tall mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited world in a moment of time and said, "I will give you all this authority and the glory of these kingdoms, because it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I want. If you will worship before me, then, they will all be yours." But answering him Jesus said, "Go back behind me, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him alone you shall serve.'"

Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_5-6" target=_top>Matthew 4:5-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_7" target=_top>7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_9" target=_top>Luke 4:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_10" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_12" target=_top>12</a>)<br />His constant victory is symbolized by the statement that after his trial, "angels came close and tended to him" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_11" target=_top>Matthew 4:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_mark_1_13" target=_top>Mark 1:13</a>).<br />[6] In short, the Lord was attacked by all the hells from early in his youth up to the very end of his life in the world, while he was continually routing, subduing, and vanquishing them. This he did purely out of love for the entire human race. Since his love was not human but divine, and the greater the love the harder the struggle, you can see how fierce his battles were and how savage on the part of the hells.<br />This is how it was, as I know for certain.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the verbal exchanges between Jesus and the Devil during the trial in the wilderness, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_1-11" target=_top>Matthew 4:1-11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1690/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_1-13" target=_top>Luke 4:1-13</a>.

They that remained fled to the mountain. That this signifies that not all were overcome, is evident without explication, from the fact that there was a residue that fled away. In the internal sense the 
temptations are treated of that the Lord sustained in His childhood, concerning which nothing is related in the Word of the New Testament, except concerning His temptation in the wilderness, or soon 
after He came out of the wilderness, and finally concerning His last temptation in Gethsemane and what then followed. That the Lord's life, from His earliest childhood even to the last hour of His life 
in the world, was continual temptation and continual victory, is evident from many things in the Word of the Old Testament; and that it did not cease with the temptation in the wilderness is evident 
from what is said in Luke: </p>
<p>     And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him for a season (Luke 4:13); </p>
<p>as also from the fact that He was tempted even to the death on the 
cross, and thus to the last hour of His life in the world. Hence it is evident that the whole of the Lord's life in the world, from His earliest childhood, was continual temptation and continual victory. 
The last was when He prayed on the cross for His enemies, and thus for all in the whole world.  [2] In the Word of the Lord's life, in the Gospels, none but the last is mentioned, except His temptation 
in the wilderness. More were not disclosed to the disciples. The things that were disclosed appear in the sense of the letter so slight as to be scarcely anything; for to speak and to answer 
in this manner is no temptation, when yet His temptation was more grievous than can ever be comprehended and believed by any human mind. No one can know what temptation is except the one who has been 
in it. The temptation that is related in Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13, contains all temptations in a summary; namely, that from love toward the whole human race, the Lord fought against the 
loves of self and of the world, with which the hells were filled.  [3] All temptation is an assault upon the love in which the man is, and the temptation is in the same degree as is the love. If the 
love is not assaulted, there is no temptation. To destroy anyone's love is to destroy his very life; for the love is the life. The Lord's life was love toward the whole human race, and was indeed so 
great, and of such a quality, as to be nothing but pure love. Against this His life, continual temptations were admitted, as before said, from His earliest childhood to His last hour in the world. The 
love which was the Lord's veriest life is signified by His "hungering," and by the devil's saying,       If Thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread and by Jesus answering 
that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God (Luke 4:2-4; Matt. 4:2-4). [4] That He fought against the love of the world, or all things that are of the love of the world, is signified 
by: </p>
<p>     The devil took Him up into a high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said unto Him, All this power will I give Thee and the glory of them, 
for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it; if Thou therefore wilt worship before me, all shall be Thine. But Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind Me, Satan; 
for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve (Luke 4:5-8; Matt 4:8-10). [5] That He fought against the love of self, and all things that are of the love of self, 
is signified by this: </p>
<p>     The devil took Him into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto Him, If Thou art the Son of God, cast Thyself down for it is written, He 
shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, and upon their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest Thou dash Thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the 
Lord thy God (Matt. 4:5-7; Luke 4:9-12). Continual victory is signified by its being said that after the temptations, "angels came and ministered unto Him" (Matt. 4:11; Mark 1:13).  [6] In brief, the 
Lord from His earliest childhood up to the last hour of His life in the world, was assaulted by all the hells, against which He continually fought, and subjugated and overcame them, and this solely 
from love toward the whole human race. And because this love was not human but Divine, and because such as is the greatness of the love, such is that of the temptation, it may be seen how grievous the 
combats were, and how great the ferocity on the part of the hells. That all this was so, I know of a certainty. </p>

That 'the rest fled to the mountain' means that it did not happen to all of them is clear without explanation from the fact that they had now become 'the rest', who fled away. The subject in the internal 
sense is the temptations which the Lord underwent in childhood, about which nothing is recorded in the New Testament Word. No temptations are recorded there apart from the temptation in the wilderness, 
or shortly after He came out of the wilderness, and the last temptation later on in Gethsemane and after that. The fact that the Lord's life from earliest childhood right through to the last hour 
of His life in the world consisted in constant temptation and constant victory is clear from many places in the Old Testament Word; and the fact that it did not end with His temptation in the wilderness 
is clear from the following in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
After the devil had ended every temptation he departed from Him for a time. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:13</a>, </p>
<p>as well as from His undergoing temptations right through to His 
death on the Cross, and so to the last hour of His life in the world. From these considerations it is evident that the whole of the Lord's life in the world from earliest childhood consisted in constant 
temptation and constant victory. The last was when on the Cross He prayed for His enemies, and so for all people in the whole world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the part of the Word where the Lord's life is described 
- in the Gospels- no other temptation, apart from the last, is mentioned than His temptation in the wilderness. More than this was not disclosed to the disciples; and the things which were disclosed 
seem in the sense of the letter so slight as to amount to scarcely anything at all. For the things that are said, and the replies that are given, do not seem to constitute any temptation at all; yet 
in fact His temptation in the wilderness was more severe than the human mind can possibly comprehend and believe. Nobody can know what temptation is except someone who has experienced it. The temptation 
that is recorded in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:1-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:1-11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:1-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:1-13</a>, incorporates in a summary form all temptations, namely this, that out of His love towards the whole human race He fought against self-love 
and love of the world, with which the hells were filled completely. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 All temptation is an attack against the love present in a person, the degree of temptation depending on the degree of that 
love. If love is not attacked there is no temptation. Destroying another person's love is destroying his very life, for his love is his life The Lord's life was love towards the whole human race; indeed 
it was so great and of such a nature as to be nothing other than pure love. Against this life of His, temptations were directed constantly, and this was happening, as has been stated, from earliest 
childhood through to His last hour in the world. The love that was the Lord's very life is meant by His being hungry and by the devil's saying, </p>
<p>If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become 
bread And Jesus answered, It is written that man will not live by bread alone but by every word of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:2-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:2-4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:2-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:2-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That He fought against love of the world, or against all that 
constitutes love of the world, is meant by the devil's taking Him on to a high mountain and showing Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and saying, </p>
<blockquote>
To you I will give all this power 
and their glory, for it has been given to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship before me, it will all be yours. But answering him Jesus said, Get behind Me, satan! for it is 
written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:5-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:5-8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:8-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:8-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 That He fought against self-love, and all that constitutes self-love, is meant by these words, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
devil took Him into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, He will give His angels charge 
regarding you, and on their hands they will bear you, lest you strike your foot against a stone. Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:5-7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:9-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:9-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Constant 
victory is meant by the statement that after temptation angels came and ministered to Him, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1:13</a>.

<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 To sum up, the Lord was attacked by all the hells from earliest 
childhood right through to the last hour of His life in the world. The hells were constantly overpowered, subdued, and vanquished by Him; and this He did solely out of love towards the whole human 
race. And because this love was not human but Divine, and because the intensity of the love determines that of the temptation, it becomes clear how severe His conflicts were, and on the part of the hells 
how fierce. That all this was indeed the case I know for sure. </p>

Quod 'residui in montem fugerunt' significet quod non omnes, constat absque explicatione, ex eo quod residui facti, qui aufugerunt.  In sensu interno agitur de tentationibus quos sustinuit Dominus in 
pueritia, de qua nihil memoratur in Verbo Novi Testamenti, solum de tentatione in deserto seu mox postquam venit ex deserto, et denique de ultima tentatione in Gethsemane, et porro: quod Domini vita 
a prima pueritia usque ad ultimam horam vitae in mundo fuerit continua tentatio et continua victoria, constat a pluribus in Verbo Veteris Testamenti, et quod non cessaverit cum tentatione in deserto, 
constat ab his apud Lucam, 	Postquam absolvit omnem tentationem diabolus, destitit ab Ipso ad tempus 13; </p>
<p>tum ex eo quod usque ad mortem crucis tentatus sit, sic ad ultimam horam vitae in mundo; inde 
patet quod tota Domini vita in mundo a prima pueritia fuerit continua tentatio et continua victoria; ultima fuit cum, super cruce oravit pro inimicis, ita pro omnibus in universo terrarum orbe.  In Verbo 
vitae Domini apud Evangelistas, non memoratur, praeter ultimam, quam tentatio Ipsius in deserto; plura discipulis non detecta sunt; quae detecta, secundum sensum litterae tam levia apparent ut vix 
aliquid, [2] nam ita dicere et ita respondere non est aliqua tentatio, cum tamen gravior fiat quam usquam aliqua mens humana capere et credere possit; nemo scire potest quid tentatio, nisi qui in illa 
fuit; tentatio quae memoratur apud Matth. iv 1-11; Marc. i 12, 13; Luc. iv 1-13, continet in summa tentationes, nempe quod ex amore erga universum genus humanum pugnaverit contra amores sui et mundi, 
quibus repleta fuerunt inferna: [3] omnis tentatio fit contra amorem in quo est homo; in quali gradu est amor in tali fit tentatio; si non contra amorem, nulla est tentatio; amorem alicujus destruere, 
est ipsam vitam, nam amor est vita; Domini vita fiat amor erga universum genus humanum, et quidem tantus et talis ut non nisi quam purus amor; contra hanc Ipsius vitam admissae sunt tentationes continuae, 
ut dictum, a prima pueritia ad ultimam horam in mundo.  Amor qui fuit ipsissima Domini vita, significatur per quod 	Esuriverit, et quod diabolus dixerit; Si Filius es Dei, dic lapidi huic, ut 
fiat panis; et quod responderit Jesus, Scriptum est, quod non per panem solum victurus sit homo, sed per omne verbum Dei, Luc. iv 2-4; Matth. iv 2-4. [4]	Quod pugnaverit contra amorem mundi, seu omnia 
quae sunt amor mundi, significatur per quod 	Deduxerit Ipsum diabolus in montem altum, et monstraverit Ipsi omnia regna orbis terrarum in momento temporis, et quod dixerit, Tibi dabo potestatem hanc 
omnem, et gloriam eorum, quia mihi data est, et cui voluero, do eam; Tu ergo si adoraveris coram me, erunt Tibi omnia; sed respondens ipsi Jesus dixit Abi post Me satana, scriptum namque est, Adorabis 
Dominum Deum tuum, et Illi Soli servies, Luc. iv 5-8; Matth. iv 8-10. [5] Quod contra amorem sui, et omnia quae sunt amoris sui, significatur per haec, 	Assumpsit Ipsum diabolus in sanctam urbem, 
et statuit Ipsum super pinnulam templi, et dixit Ipsi, Si Filius es Dei mitte Te Ipsum deorsum; scriptum enim est, Angelis suis praecipiet de te, et super manibus portabunt te, ne forte offendas ad 
lapidem pedem tuum; dixit ei Jesus, Iterum scriptum est, Non tentabis Dominum Deum tuum, Matth. iv 5-7; Luc. iv 9-12. Continua victoria significatur per haec quod post tentationem, 	Angeli accesserint 
et ministraverint Ipsi, Matth. iv 	11; Marc. i 13. [6]	In summa, Dominus a prima pueritia usque ad ultimam horam vitae in mundo, ab omnibus infernis oppugnatus est, quae continue ab Ipso expugnata, 
subjugata et victa, et hoc unice ex amore erga universum genus humanum, qui amor quia non fuit humanus sed Divinus, quantus amor tanta tentatio, constare potest qualis pugnarum gravitas fuit, et a 
parte infernorum quanta ferocia: quod haec ita se habuerint, pro certo scio. </p>
