<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2298节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2298.</strong>通过来世习以为常的交流方式，我被指示孩子在看到各种事物时是怎样的观念。在他们眼中，万物似乎都是活的，以至于他们的一切思想观念都有生命。我还发觉，尘世的小孩子在玩耍时也有同样的观念，因为他们尚不具备成人才有的对无生命之物的反思能力。</p>

It has been shown me by a method of communication that is familiar in the other life of what nature are the ideas of little children when they see any objects. They were as if everything was alive, so 
that they had life in every idea of their thought. I also perceived that little children on earth have very similar ideas when they are at play; for as yet they have not reflection, such as adults have, 
as regards that which is devoid of life. </p>

By a method of communication that is familiar in the next life I have been shown the nature of young children's ideas when they see any objects. Their ideas were such that every single thing was living, 
so that each idea comprising their thought had life within it. I also perceived that the ideas present in young children on earth when playing games were almost the same, for they do not as yet have 
the ability like adults to reflect on that which is inanimate. </p>

Ostensum mihi per modum communicationis in altera vita familiarem, quales infantum ideae sunt, cum vident aliqua objecta, erant sicut omnia et singula viverent; sic ut in cogitationis {1} suae ideis 
singulis haberent vitam: et perceptum, quod similes fere ideae sint infantibus in tellure cum in suis lusoriis sunt; nam nondum iis reflexio qualis adultis, quid inanimatum. 	@1 eorum.$ </p>
