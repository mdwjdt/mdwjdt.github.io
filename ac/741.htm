<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第741节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>741.</strong>人皆清楚看出，“挪亚进入方舟，躲避诸水的泛滥”表示他受到保护。试探无非是恶灵和同人在一起的天使之间的争战。恶灵会唤起一个人自小做过，甚至曾思想过的所有错事，并在这样做时谴责他，因为没有什么比这更令他们快乐的了。事实上，他们生活的快乐就在其中。但主会藉着天使保护这人，防止恶灵和魔鬼越界，用超出他的承受能力的东西压垮他。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]741.</strong> Anyone can see that Noah entered the ark because of the waters of the flood means that he was protected.<br />The tests that we undergo are nothing else than battles between the evil spirits and angels who are present with us. The evil spirits summon up every wrong that we have ever done or even considered from childhood on. So they stir up both what is evil and what is false in us and condemn us for it. Nothing gratifies them more; it is the central pleasure of their lives. But through the angels the Lord protects us and prevents evil spirits and demons from pushing beyond the furthest limits of our endurance and drowning us. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 741</b></p><p><b>741.</b>
Noah went into the ark from before the waters of the flood. That this signifies that he was protected, must be evident to everyone. Temptations are nothing else than combats of evil spirits with the 
angels who are with a man. Evil spirits call up all the wrong things that from his infancy a man has either done or even thought, thus both his evils and his falsities, and condemn him, and there is nothing 
that gives them greater delight than to do this, for the very delight of their life consists therein. But through angels the Lord guards the man, and restrains the evil spirits and genii from ranging 
beyond bounds and inundating the man beyond what he is able to bear. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 741</b></p><p><b>741.</b>
That 'Noah went into the ark from before the waters of the flood' means that he was protected may become clear to anyone. Temptations are nothing other than conflicts between evil spirits and angels 
who reside with a person. Evil spirits activate all the dishonourable things the person has done or even thought which have been with him since early childhood, thus both evils and falsities; and in so 
doing, the spirits condemn him, for nothing gives them greater delight. Indeed the very delight of their lives consists in doing just that. But the Lord protects the person by means of angels and prevents 
the evil spirits and genii from overstepping the mark and overwhelming him with more than he can cope with. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 741</b>
</p><b>741.</b>
Quod 'intravit Noahus in arcam a coram aquis diluvii' significet quod tutatus, unicuique constare potest. Tentationes non aliud sunt quam pugnae malorum spirituum cum angelis qui apud hominem: mali spiritus 
omnia prava hominis facta excitant, etiam cogitata, quae habuit ab infantia, ita tam mala quam falsa, et condemnant, quo illis nihil jucundius est; ipsa vitae eorum jucunditas in eo consistit; 
at Dominus per angelos, hominem tutatur, et prohibet ne mali spiritus et genii extra limites et ulterius quam sustinere possit homo, vagentur et inundent. </p>
