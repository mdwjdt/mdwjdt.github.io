<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7248节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7248.</strong>我被告知，这个星球的居民在死后成为灵人，出现在这一侧时，他们从掠夺行为中获得最大快乐，尤其以吃掠夺物为乐。当他们思想吃自己的掠夺物时，他们所体验到的快乐被传给我，我发觉它非常强烈。我们自己的星球也曾住有具有这种兽性的人，这一事实从各个民族的历史，还有迦南地的居民（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上30.16.htm">30:16</a>），以及大卫时代的犹太和以色列民族明显看出来；因为他们年年都突袭并掠夺这些民族，因掠夺物而欢喜。就金星的这些居民而言，他们虽以掠夺为乐，但并不残忍。他们把所掳掠的人丢在水里，以这种方式处死他们；但也尽可能地让他们存活。然后，他们埋葬那些被他们如此处死的人；这表明他们尚有一些人性，不像犹太人，犹太人的快乐是把被他们杀死的人扔到一边，任由他们被森林里的野兽或飞禽吞吃，有时还以野蛮、残忍的方式处死他们（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下12.31.htm">12:31</a>）。犹太人在这种事上获得何等的快乐，我也从传给我的气场得以发觉，这气场是从他们当中许多很快走近，然后又逃跑的人发出的。</p>

I have been told that the inhabitants of that planet who, when they die and become spirits, appear on this side, are very much delighted with plunder, and especially with eating of their plunder; their 
delight when they think about eating of their plunder was communicated to me, and I noticed that it was intense. That there have been inhabitants on this earth also of such a ferine nature, is plain 
from the histories of various nations, also from the inhabitants of the land of Canaan (1 Sam. 30:16), and likewise from the Jewish and Israelitish nation even in the time of David, in that they made 
yearly raids, and plundered the nations, and rejoiced over their prey. As regards these inhabitants of the planet Venus, they are indeed delighted with plunder, but yet are not cruel. They cast the 
men whom they rob into the water, and so put them to death, but they save as many as they can; and those whom they so put to death they afterward bury, a sign that they have some humanity. In this they 
differ from the Jews, who took delight in casting out those whom they slew, and exposing them to be devoured by the beasts of the forest and by the birds, and sometimes in putting them to death in a 
savage and cruel manner (2 Sam. 12:31). How much delight the Jews had in such things, it was also given me to perceive from the sphere of many of them communicated to me, who approached quickly and then 
fled away. </p>

I have been told that the inhabitants of that planet who, when they die and become spirits, appear on this side of it derive the greatest pleasure out of acts of plunder, and most especially out of eating 
from the plunder. The delight they experience when they think about eating from the plunder was conveyed to me, and I perceived that it was very great. The fact that people with that kind of bestial 
nature have also inhabited our own planet is evident from the history of various nations, and also from the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2030:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 30:16</a>, as well as from the Jewish and Israelite 
nation in David's time, in that they made raids every year on nations, pillaged them, and rejoiced in the pillage. So far as these inhabitants of the planet Venus are concerned, they do indeed find 
pleasure in acts of plunder; yet they are not cruel. They throw people whom they despoil into water, using that as the method to put them to death; but they keep alive those they can. They afterwards 
bury those whom they have put to death in that way, which shows that there is some humanity in them, unlike the Jews, whose delight it was to cast aside those they killed and expose them to be devoured 
by wild animals of the forest or by birds, and sometimes to put them to death in a savage and cruel manner, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2012:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 12:31</a>. How much delight the Jews took in such practices I was also allowed to recognize 
in the sphere conveyed to me from those who, in great numbers, quickly came near and then fled.  </p>

Dictum mihi quod incolae illius planetae qui cum obeunt et fiunt spiritus, ab hac parte apparent, admodum delectentur rapinis et quam maxime edere ex rapinis, jucunditas illorum cum {1}cogitant de edere 
ex rapinis, mecum communicata fuit, et appercepta quod summa esset.  Quod {2}incolae tali natura ferina etiam in hac tellure fuerint, patet ex historiis variarum gentium, tum ex incolis terrae Canaanis, 
1 Sam. xxx 16; et quoque ex gente Judaica et Israelitica etiam tempore Davidis, quod quotannis excursiones fecerint et depraedati gentes et ex praeda laetati.  Quod hos incolas planetae Veneris 
{3}concernit, quidem delectantur rapinis, sed usque non crudeles sunt; projiciunt homines quos diripiunt in aquas, {4}ac eo modo interimunt, {5}ast quos conservare possunt, conservant; et quos ita interemerunt, 
postea sepeliunt, indicium quod aliquid humani apud se habeant, secus ac Judaei quibus delectatio fuit projicere illos quos occiderunt, et exponere feris silvae et avibus devorandos, et quandoque 
saeve et crudeliter illos morti dare, 2 Sam. xii 31; quantum jucunditatis ex talibus habuerant Judaei, datum quoque erat percipere ex sphaera mecum communicata plurium illorum qui cito appulerunt 
et aufugerunt. 	@1 ex rapinis edunt$ 	@2 naturae tales ferinae incolae$ 	@3 attinet$ 	@4 et sic$ 	@5 at$ </p>
