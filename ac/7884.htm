<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7884节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7884.</strong>“要守为一个节日，作为永远的定例”表就那些属于属灵教会的人而言，照着天堂的秩序而对主的敬拜。这从“永远的定例”和“守为一个节日”的含义清楚可知：“永远的定例”是指天堂的秩序，如下文所述；“守为一个节日”是指对主的敬拜，如刚才所述（<a href="7882.htm">7882</a>节）。由于以色列人就是那被吩咐守为一个节日的人，故所表示的是那些属于属灵教会的人。“永远的定例”之所以表示天堂的秩序，是因为吩咐给以色列人的一切条例都是从天堂的秩序流出的那种；因此，它们也代表天堂的事物。照天堂的秩序而敬拜是指照主的诫命所行的一切良善。如今对神的敬拜主要是指教会里的口头敬拜，包括早晨和晚上。然而，对神的敬拜本质上并不在于此，而是在于功用的生活，或说履行有用服务的生活；这后一种敬拜符合天堂的秩序。口头敬拜也是敬拜，但若没有属于生活的敬拜，口头敬拜没有任何用处；因为属于生活的敬拜是心的敬拜。口头上的敬拜若要成为真正的敬拜，就必须从这种敬拜发出。</p>

Ye shall keep it by an eternal statute. That this signifies the worship of the Lord according to the order of heaven on the part of those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification 
of "an eternal statute," as being the order of heaven (of which below); and from the signification of "keeping a feast," as being the worship of the Lord (as just above, n. 7882); and because it 
is said to the sons of Israel that they should "keep it," they are meant who are of the spiritual church. That "an eternal statute" denotes the order of heaven, is because all the statutes that were 
commanded to the sons of Israel were such as flowed from the order of heaven; consequently they also represented the things that are of heaven. By worship according to the order of heaven is meant all 
practicing of good according to the Lord's precepts. By the worship of God at this day is chiefly meant the oral worship in a temple, both morning and evening. But the worship of God does not consist 
essentially in this, but in a life of uses; this latter worship is according to the order of heaven. Oral worship is also worship, but it is of no avail whatever unless there is the worship that belongs 
to the life; for this worship is of the heart; and oral worship, that it may be worship, must proceed from this. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7884</b></p><p><b>7884.</b>
'You shall keep it as a feast by an eternal statute' means worship of the Lord in keeping with the order of heaven for those belonging to the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'an eternal 
statute' as the order of heaven, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'keeping a feast' as worship of the Lord, as just above in <a href="7882.htm">7882</a>. And since the children of Israel are the ones who are 
told to keep it as a feast, those belonging to the spiritual Church are meant. The reason why 'an eternal statute' means the order of heaven is that all the statutes which the children of Israel were 
commanded to observe were the kind that flowed from the order of heaven, and therefore also represented the things of heaven. By worship in keeping with the order of heaven one should understand all 
the good that is performed in keeping with the Lord's commandments. By the worship of God people at the present day mean primarily worship of the lips in church, and also morning and evening. Worship 
of God does not however consist essentially in that, but in a life of performing useful services; this worship is in keeping with the order of heaven. Worship of the lips is also worship, but it achieves 
nothing whatever without worship in the life one leads, since this is worship of the heart. If worship on the lips is to be true worship it must spring from this. </p>

</p><b>7884.</b>
`Statuto aeterno feriabimini illum': quod significet cultum Domini secundum ordinem caeli pro illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, constat ex significatione `statuti aeterni' quod sit ordo caeli, de qua 
sequitur, et ex significatione `feriari' quod sit cultus Domini, ut mox supra n. 7882; et quia dicitur ad filios Israelis quod `illi feriaturi illum,' intelliguntur qui ab Ecclesia spirituali.  Quod 
`statutum aeternum' sit ordo caeli, est quia omnia statuta quae filiis Israelis mandata sunt erant talia quae fluebant ex ordine caeli; inde etiam repraesentabant illa quae caeli.  Per cultum secundum 
ordinem caeli intelligitur omne exercitium boni secundum praecepta Domini; per cultum Dei hodie intelligitur imprimis cultus oris {1} in templo, tum mane et vespere {2}; sed cultus Dei non in {3}eo 
essentialiter consistit, verum in vita usuum, {4} ille cultus est secundum ordinem caeli; cultus oris est quoque cultus, sed prorsus nihil facit nisi cultus vitae sit, nam hic cultus est cordis; {5}ille, 
ut cultus sit, ex hoc procedat. 	@1 i cum$ 	@2 i oratio tunc$ 	@3 illis$ 	@4 i secundum praecepta in Verbo, tunc enim charitatis exercitia praestat, et$ 	@5 ex hoc procedit ille$ </p>
