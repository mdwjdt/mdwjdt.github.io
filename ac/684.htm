<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于构成天堂的社群</h4><br />684．天堂有三层：第一层是善灵（good spirits）的居所，第二层是天使灵（angelic spirits）的居所，第三层是天使（angels）的居所。一个比一个内在和纯粹，以致它们彼此区别最为显着，并相互分离。每一层天堂，无论第一、第二还是第三层，都被划分为无数社群。每个社群都由众多个体构成，他们以其和谐一致仿佛构成一个人。所有社群一起则如同一个人。社群的性质照着相爱和信主的方式而各异。这些差异数不胜数，以致它们最为普遍的属都无法被数算出来。即便最小的差异也以最完美的秩序被排列，从而完全一致地融入到一个总的统一体中，就象总的统一体融入个体的一致性中一样。因此，每个个体都对全体的幸福有所贡献，而全体对每个个体的幸福也有所贡献。所以，每个天使和每个社群就是整个天堂的一个形像，可以说是微型的天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]684.</strong> The Communities That Make Up Heaven<br />THERE are three heavens. Good spirits inhabit the first, angelic spirits the second, and angels the third. Each heaven is deeper and purer than the one before it. The result is that the heavens are perfectly distinct from one another.<br />The first heaven, the second heaven, and the third heaven are each divided into numberless communities. Each community consists of many people who because of the compatibility and unanimity among them form a single personality, so to speak. And all the communities together form a single human being.<br />The distinctions among the communities are created by differences in mutual love and in faith in the Lord. Those differences are so far beyond counting that I cannot list even the most universal kinds.<br />Not the smallest difference exists that is not fitted into its exact place in the overall plan. In this way it can unite with all the other pieces in perfect concord to form a common whole, and the common whole can contribute to unity among the individual pieces. Thus everything combines for the happiness of the whole (rising from the individuals' happiness) and for the individuals' happiness (rising from the happiness of the whole).<br />In consequence, each angel and each community is an image of the whole of heaven and a kind of heaven-in-miniature.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a more detailed elaboration of the schema of the three heavens set out in this section, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_29" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 29-40</a>, a passage that contains many footnote references back to further discussion in Secrets of Heaven itself.

CONCERNING THE SOCIETIES WHICH CONSTITUTE HEAVEN There are three heavens: the First is the abode of good spirits, the Second of angelic spirits, and the Third of angels. And one heaven is more interior 
and pure than another, so that they are most distinct. Each heaven, the first, the second, and the third, is distinguished into innumerable societies; and each society consists of many individuals, 
who by their harmony and unanimity constitute as it were one person; and all the societies together are as one man. The societies are distinct from one another according to the differences of mutual 
love, and of faith in the Lord. These differences are so innumerable that not even the most universal genera of them can be computed; and there is not the least of difference that is not disposed in 
most perfect order, so as to conspire most harmoniously to a common unity, and the common unity to unanimity of individuals, and thereby to the happiness of all from each, and of each from all. Each angel 
and each society is therefore an image of the universal heaven, and is as it were a little heaven. </p>

THE COMMUNITIES THAT CONSTITUTE HEAVEN </p>
<p>There are three heavens, the first where good spirits are, the second where angelic spirits are, and the third where angels are. One heaven is interior to and 
purer than the next, which means that they are entirely distinct and separate from one another. The first heaven divides into countless communities, as do the second and the third, and each community 
consists of many individuals who, because of the harmony and unanimity that exist among them, in effect constitute one person. At the same time, all the communities in effect constitute one human being. 
Communities differ in nature from one another according to the way their mutual love and faith in the Lord varies. These differences are so countless that it is not possible to count up even the 
most general kinds of them. Even the smallest of differences fits into the perfectly ordered arrangement of the whole, and so contributes in perfect unanimity to a general unity, as does the general unity 
to the unanimity among individuals. Each individual therefore contributes to the happiness of all, and all to that of each individual. Consequently every angel and every community is an image of 
the whole of heaven and is so to speak heaven in miniature.  </p>

De Societatibus quae Caelum constituunt </p>
<p>SUNT tres caeli, primum ubi spiritus boni, secundum ubi spiritus angelici, tertium ubi angeli; et unum interius et purius altero, ita inter se distinctissimi: 
tam primum caelum, quam secundum et tertium, distinctum est in innumerabiles societates, et unaquaevis societas ex pluribus consistit, qui ex harmonia et unanimitate constituunt sicut unam personam, 
et omnes societates simul sicut unum hominem. Societates inter se distinctae sunt secundum differentias amoris mutui et fidei in Dominum; quae differentiae tam innumerabiles sunt ut ne quidem genera 
universalissima recenseri queant: nec datur minimum differentiae quod non ordinatissime dispositum sit, ut (x)unanimissime conspiret ad commune unum, et commune unum ad singulorum unanimum, et inde 
ad omnium ex singulis, et singulorum ab omnibus, felicitatem. Inde unusquisque angelus et unaquaevis societas est universi caeli imago et sicut exiguum caelum. </p>
