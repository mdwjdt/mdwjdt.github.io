<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8690节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8690.</strong>“众百姓从早到晚都站在你的面前呢”表那时这是那些属于属灵教会的人在每种状态下所拥有的意愿的一切行为的源头。这从以色列的代表，以及“站在摩西面前”和“从早到晚”的含义清楚可知。以色列，即此处的“百姓”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="8645.htm">8645</a>节）。“站在摩西面前”是指服从神之真理，如前所述（<a href="8686.htm">8686</a>节）；它因是指服从，故是指意愿的一个行为；事实上，服从源于意愿，不过源于一个出于命令而非对真理的情感而实行真理的意愿，因为这意愿是服从。“从早到晚”是指在每种状态下，无论内在的还是外在的，如前所述（<a href="8687.htm">8687</a>节）。<br />此处论述的主题是一个人在重生之前所经历的第一种状态。在这种状态下，他行良善是出于服从，还不是出于情感。但这种良善是他所行的真理，因为他这样做只是出于命令，因而仍是出于强迫，而非出于自由。当他出于情感行善时，就是出于自由行善；因为从爱与情感所流出的一切都是自由的。当一个人经历第一种状态时，主就会流入并直接引导；但主的直接流注不会进入觉知，因为它流入人的最内层；但当主的流注既是直接的，同时也是间接的时，它就会进入觉知，并产生情感，因为它不仅流入人的最内层，还流入他的中间和最外层。这一种状态就是本章接下来所论述的；而前一种状态则是这几节所描述的，在这几节，经上论到摩西说，他独自审判（参看前面的说明，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>节）。</p>

And all the people standing over thee from the morning until the evening. That this signifies that at that time this was the source of everything of will with those who were of the spiritual church, 
in every state, is evident from the representation of Israel, who is here "the people," as being those who are of the spiritual church (see above, n. 8645); from the signification of "standing over" Moses, 
as being obedience in conformity with truth Divine (as also above, n. 8686), and because it denotes obedience, it is of the will, for obedience is of the will, but it is the will to do truth by 
reason of command, not by reason of affection, and this will is obedience; and from the signification of "from the morning until the evening," as being in every state, interior and exterior (of which 
above, n. 8687). The first state, in which man is before regeneration, is here treated of, which is that he does good from obedience, and not yet from affection; but this good is the truth which he does, 
because it is done only from command, thus as yet from compulsion, but not from freedom. He does good from freedom when he does it from affection; for everything that flows from the affection which 
is of love is free. When man is in the former state, then the Lord flows in and leads immediately; but the immediate influx of the Lord does not come to perception, because it is into the inmosts of 
the man; whereas the influx of the Lord which is immediate and at the same time mediate, does come to perception, and gives affection, for it is not only into man's inmosts, but also into his mediates 
and outmosts. This latter state is treated of in what follows in this chapter; the former is described in these verses, where it is said of Moses that he judged alone (see what has been said above, 
n. 8685). </p>

'And all the people are standing before you from morning until evening' means that at this time it was the source of every act of the will which those belonging to the spiritual Church possessed, in 
every state. This is clear from the representation of Israel, to whom 'the people' refers here, as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with above in <a href="8645.htm">8645</a>; from the meaning of 'standing before 
Moses' as obedience to God's truth, also dealt with above, in <a href="8686.htm">8686</a>, and - since obedience is meant - as an act of the will (obedience springs from the will, but from a will to do the truth because 
it has been commanded, not out of affection for it; and this will is obedience); and from the meaning of 'from morning until evening' as in every state, inwardly and outwardly, dealt with above in <a href="8687.htm">8687</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The subject here is the first state a person passes through before regeneration. During this state he does good in a spirit of obedience and not as yet out of affection. But this good is truth 
as done by him, since he does it solely because it has been commanded, and so is still acting under compulsion, not in freedom. It is done by him in freedom when he does it out of affection; for everything 
that flows from love and affection is free. While a person passes through the first state the Lord flows in and leads him directly; but direct influx from the Lord does not come to be perceived 
because it is an influx into the inmost parts of a person's being and does not therefore generate affection. But when the Lord's influx is direct and at the same time indirect it does come to be perceived 
and generate affection, since it is an influx not only into the inmost parts of a person but also into the middle and outermost. This latter state is dealt with in the verses following below in 
this chapter, the former state in the present verses, where it says that Moses judged alone; see what has been stated above in <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>. </p>

`Et omnis populus stans super te a mane usque ad vesperam': quod significet quod inde tunc omne voluntatis illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, in omni statu, constat ex repraesentatione `Israelis,' qui 
hic `populus,' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua supra n. 8645; ex significatione `stare super Moschen' quod sit oboedientia ex vero Divino, de qua etiam supra n. 8686; et quia est oboedientia, 
est voluntatis, nam oboedientia (c)est ex voluntate, at est voluntas faciendi verum ex mandato, non autem ex affectione, quae voluntas est oboedientia; et ex significatione `a mane usque ad vesperam' 
quod sit in omni statu, interius et exterius, de qua supra n. 8687. 	2 Agitur hic de statu primo in quo homo {1}ante regenerationem, qui est ut faciat bonum ex oboedientia et nondum ex affectione, 
sed id bonum est verum quod facit, quia solum ex mandato, ita adhuc ex coacto, non autem ex libero; ex libero facit cum ex affectione, nam omne quod ex affectione quae amoris, fluit, est liberum; 
cum homo in priore statu est, tunc Dominus influit {2}ac ducit immediate, sed influxus immediatus Domini non ad perceptionem veni:, quia est in {3}intima hominis, inde nec dat affectionem, at influxus 
Domini immediatus et simul mediatus ad perceptionem venit et dat affectionem, {4}nam non solum est in {3}hominis intima, sed etiam est in {5}ejus media et extrema; de hoc statu agitur in sequentibus 
hujus capitis, de illo in his versibus, ubi de Mosche dicitur quod solus judicaverit, videantur quae supra n. 8685. 	@1 qui regeneratur$ 	@2 immediate, ac ducit A, ac inducit immediate T$ 	@3 intimis$ 	@4
