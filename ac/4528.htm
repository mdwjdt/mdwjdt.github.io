<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4528.</strong>眼睛，确切地说，眼睛的视觉，尤其对应于来世那些被天堂花园所围绕的社群；天堂花园就在前上方稍向右一点；在那里，人能看到花园里有树木和鲜花，其属和种如此众多，以致与它们相比，整个地球上所能发现的树种和花种少得可怜。那里的每一个物体都有某种聪明和智慧从它闪耀出来，以至于你会说，花园里的人同时也在聪明和智慧的天堂花园里。这些花园会激发人的内心情感，因而不仅悦目，同时还愉悦他们的理解力。<br />这些天堂花园在第一层天堂，就在通往天堂内部的边缘。它们就是正当高层天堂的天使认真讨论信之真理时，从该天堂降下来的代表。那里的天使们凭借属灵和属天的观念彼此交流，对他们来说，这些观念就是口头表达的形式；他们还使用一系列代表，其优美和愉悦根本无法以任何方式形容。正是他们所谈论的这些优美和愉悦的观念在低层天堂表现为天堂花园。<br />这个天堂分为许多不同的天堂，眼前房里面的各个部分就对应于这些天堂。有一个天堂能找到刚才所描述的天堂花园。还有一个天堂能看到各种色彩的大气，在那里，整个空气仿佛因黄金、白银、珍珠、宝石、极小的花和无数其它事物而闪烁。还有一个彩虹天堂，大大小小、五彩缤纷的极美彩虹就出现在那里。所有这些都通过出自主并含有聪明、智慧在里面的光而产生，因此每一个物体都含有某种真理的聪明和良善的智慧，它们以代表的方式被展现出来。<br />那些对天堂和天堂之光没有任何概念的人难以相信那里竟有这类事物。因此，那些带着这种不信进入来世，并且一直处于信之真理与良善的人，就被天使带入这些场景；一看到它们，这些人都大为震惊。关于天堂花园、彩虹场景和大气，可参看前面根据我的经历对它们的描述（<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1626.htm">1626</a>，<a href="2296.htm">2296</a>，<a href="3220.htm">3220</a>节）；还有不断出现在诸天堂的连续代表（<a href="1807.htm">1807</a>，<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>，<a href="1971.htm">1971</a>，<a href="1980.htm">1980</a>，<a href="1981.htm">1981</a>，<a href="2299.htm">2299</a>，<a href="2763.htm">2763</a>，<a href="3213.htm">3213</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>-<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3350.htm">3350</a>，<a href="3475.htm">3475</a>，<a href="3485.htm">3485</a>节）。</p>

The eye, or rather its sight, corresponds especially to those societies in the other life which are in the paradisal regions, which appear above in front a little to the right, where gardens are vividly 
presented to view, with trees and flowers of so many genera and species that those on the whole earth are comparatively few; and within every object there is something of intelligence and wisdom that 
shines forth from it, so that you may say that the people in the gardens are at the same time in paradises of intelligence and wisdom, and it is these which inwardly affect them, and thus gladden 
not only their sight, but also at the same time their understanding. [2] These paradisal regions are in the first heaven, in the very threshold to the interiors of that heaven, and are representatives 
which come down from a higher heaven, when the angels of that heaven are conversing with one another intellectually about the truths of faith; and this speech of the angels there is effected by means 
of spiritual and celestial ideas, which with them are verbal forms, and by a continuous series of representations of inexpressible beauty and pleasantness; and it is these beauties and pleasantnesses 
of their discourse which are represented as paradisal scenes in the lower heaven. [3] This heaven is distinguished into many heavens, to which correspond the various things in the chambers of the eye. 
There is the heaven of paradisal gardens just described. There is a heaven where there are atmospheres of various colors, and where the whole air flashes as it were with gold, silver, pearls, precious 
stones, flowers in least forms, and innumerable other things. There is a rainbow heaven, where are the most beautiful rainbows, great and small, variegated with the most splendid colors. All these 
come forth by means of the light which is from the Lord, and which contains within it intelligence and wisdom, so that in every object there is something of the intelligence of truth and of the wisdom 
of good, which is thus shown representatively.  [4] They who have had no idea of heaven, nor of the light there, can with difficulty be brought to believe that such things are there, and therefore 
those who take this incredulity with them into the other life, and who have been in the truth and good of faith, are conveyed by the angels into these scenes, and when they see them they are astounded. 
(As regards the paradisal and rainbow scenes, and the atmospheres, see what has been already said from experience, n. 1619-1626, 2296, 3220; and that there are continual representations in the heavens, 
n. 1807, 1808, 1971, 1980 ,1981, 2299, 2763, 3213, 3216-3218, 3222, 3350, 3475, 3485.) </p>

The eye, or rather the sight of the eye, corresponds in particular to those communities in the next life which are surrounded by paradise gardens, which appear up above, in front and slightly to the 
right. There one can see gardens containing trees and flowers belonging to genera and species so numerous that in comparison with them those found on this entire planet are few. Each object there holds 
a measure of intelligence and wisdom shining out of it, enabling you to say that the people in those gardens are at the same time in the paradise gardens of intelligence and wisdom. Those gardens stir 
the inner feelings of the people there, and so gladden not only the eye but also at the same time the understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The paradise gardens are in the first heaven, on the verge leading to the 
inner parts of that heaven. They are representations which come down from the heaven above it when the angels of that higher heaven are engaged in serious discussion about the truths of faith. To communicate 
with one another the angels there rely on spiritual and celestial ideas to serve them as verbal expressions, and on consecutive sequences of representations, the beauty and loveliness of which 
cannot be described in any way at all. It is these beautiful and lovely expressions of ideas that are represented in the lower heaven as paradise gardens. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This heaven is divided into many separate 
heavens, to which the individual parts within the chambers of the eye correspond. There is a heaven where the paradise gardens referred to above may be found. There is a heaven where different coloured 
skies may be seen, where the whole air is flashing so to speak with gold, silver, pearls, precious stones, very tiny flowers, and countless other things. There is a rainbow heaven where very beautiful 
rainbows appear, large and small, variegated with most splendid colours. Each of these is a product of the light from the Lord which holds intelligence and wisdom within it, and therefore every 
single object there holds some measure of intelligence and wisdom - the attributes of truth and good respectively - which is manifested in this representative fashion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those who do not have 
any concept of heaven or of the light there can scarcely be led to believe that such things exist there. Consequently if those who bring that absence of belief with them into the next life have been governed 
by the truth and good of faith, they are taken by angels to those sights, and when they see them they are astounded. Concerning the paradise gardens, the skies, and the rainbow scenes, see previous 
descriptions of my experience of them in <a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1626.htm">1626</a>, <a href="2296.htm">2296</a>, <a href="3220.htm">3220</a>; also in the heavens consecutive representations occur constantly, <a href="1807.htm">1807</a>, <a href="1808.htm">1808</a>, <a href="1971.htm">1971</a>, <a href="1980.htm">1980</a>, <a href="1981.htm">1981</a>, <a href="2299.htm">2299</a>, <a href="2763.htm">2763</a>, <a href="3213.htm">3213</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>-<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3350.htm">3350</a>, <a href="3475.htm">3475</a>, <a href="3485.htm">3485</a>. </p>

Oculus seu potius visus ejus correspondet imprimis illis societatibus in altera vita quae in paradisiacis sunt, quae supra antrorsum paulisper ad dextrum apparent, ubi ad vivum sistuntur videndi 
horti cum arboribus et floribus tot generum et specierum ut pauca sint respective quae in universa tellure; in singulis ibi objectis est aliquid intelligentiae et sapientiae quod elucet, sic ut dicas 
quod sint simul in paradisis intelligentiae et sapientiae; </p>
<p>haec sunt quae ab interioribus illos qui ibi, afficiunt, et sic non solum laetificant visum, sed etiam simul intellectum.  [2] Paradisiaca 
illa sunt in primo caelo et in ipso limine ad interiora illius caeli, et sunt repraesentativa, quae e superiore caelo descendunt cum angeli superioris caeli intellectualiter de veris fidei apud 
se loquuntur; loquela angelorum ibi fit per ideas spirituales et caelestes quae illis sunt formae vocum, et continue per series repraesentationum talis pulchritudinis et amoenitatis ut nullatenus 
exprimi possit; hae pulchritudines et amoenitates sermonis (c)illorum sunt quae ut paradisiaca repraesentantur in caelo inferiore: [3] caelum hoc distinctum est in plures (o)caelos, quibus correspondent 
singula quae in cameris oculi; est caelum ubi horti paradisiaci, de quibus dictum; est caelum ubi atmosphaerae diversicolores, ubi universa aura fulgurat quasi ex auro, argento, margaritis, lapidibus 
pretiosis, floribus in minimis formis, et innumerabilibus aliis; est caelum irideum ubi irides pulcherrimae, magnae et parvae, variegatae splendidissimis coloribus: singula {1} haec existunt 
per lucem quae a Domino in qua intelligentia et sapientia, inde est in singulis objectis ibi aliquid {2} intelligentiae veri et sapientiae boni, quod repraesentative ita sistitur.  [4] Qui non aliquam 
ideam de caelo habuerunt nec de luce ibi, illi aegre possunt adduci ad credendum quod talia ibi sint; </p>
<p>quare qui in alteram vitam secum illam incredulitatem ferunt, si in vero et bono fidei fuerunt, 
auferuntur ab angelis in illa, et cum vident illa, obstupescunt; de paradisiacis, atmosphaeris et irideis, videantur quae prius ab experientia, n. 1619-1626, 2296, 3220; et quod in caelis continuae 
repraesentationes sint, n. 1807, 1808, 1971, 1980, 1981, 2299, 2763, 3213, 3216-3218, 3222, 3350, 3475, 3485.      @1 i et$      @2 i interius$ </p>
