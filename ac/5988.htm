<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5988节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5988.</strong>与我同在的一些使臣曾靠近我的头部。他们说起话来就像是睡着了，但仍说的和那些没有睡觉的人一样清楚。我发现，恶灵正以恶毒的欺骗流入这些使臣；然而，流入他们的东西立刻就消散了。恶灵因知道这些人在此之前一直是他们的使臣，故抱怨说，他们不再是他们的使臣了。这些人之所以不再是他们的使臣，是因为当他们入睡时，善灵就能作用于他们；因此，善灵的这种流注使得恶灵的恶毒欺骗被驱散。尽管如此，恶灵仍被迫流入这些使臣，而不是流入其他使臣。由此明显可知，使臣具有不同的种类和性质，这些变化取决于主的安排。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5988</b></p><p><b>5988.</b>
There were subjects with me near the head, who spoke as if they were asleep, but still spoke well, as do they who are not in a state of sleep. It was observed that evil spirits were flowing into these 
subjects with malignant deceits, but that the influx into them was instantly dissipated; and as the evil spirits knew that these spirits had previously been their subjects, they complained that they 
were no longer so. The reason was that being asleep good spirits could act into them, and thus by their influx the malignities of the evil spirits were dispelled. Nevertheless the evil spirits were compelled 
to flow into these subjects and not into others. This shows that there are subjects of different kinds and natures, and that the variations are in accordance with the Lord's disposal. </p>

Some subordinates were once present with me close to my head. They talked as if they were asleep, yet they spoke perfectly well, as those do who are not asleep. I noticed that evil spirits were entering 
with obnoxious deceits into those subordinates, yet what went in was immediately dispersed. And because they knew that these same people had been their subordinates prior to that, they complained 
that they were no longer so. The reason they were no longer so was that good spirits could now act on them when they were asleep, so that this influx of the good spirits caused the obnoxious deceits of 
the evil ones to be dispelled. Even so the evil spirits were compelled to flow into these and no other subordinates. From this it is evident that subordinates vary in kind and nature and these variations 
exist as the Lord disposes. </p>

Fuerunt subjecta apud me {1}juxta caput, qui locuti sicut essent in somno, sed usque locuti sunt bene, sicut ii qui non in statu somni sunt; observabatur quod mali spiritus in illa subjecta cum malignis 
dolis influerent, sed quod influxus in illis {2}actutum dissiparetur; et quia noverunt quod iidem illi fuerint prius illorum subjecta, ideo conquesti sunt quod amplius non essent; causa {3} erat 
quia boni spiritus in illos nunc, cum in somno {4}erant, agere possent, et sic quod per influxum illorum, maligna spirituum malorum discuterentur.  Sed usque cogebantur mali spiritus in illa non in alia 
influere.  Inde patet quod dentur subjecta diversi generis et naturae, et{5} quod variationes sint, secundum dispositionem Domini. @1 supra, cf. 5989$ @2 illico$ @3 i quod non essent$ @4 essent$ @5 
variationes circa illos$ </p>
