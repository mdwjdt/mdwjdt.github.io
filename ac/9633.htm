Verses 15-30. And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation of shittim wood, standing up. Ten cubits shall be the length of a plank, and a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank. Two hands 
shall there be in one plank, combined one to the other; thus shalt thou make for all the planks of the Habitation. And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation twenty planks for the corner of 
the south toward the south. And thou shalt make forty bases of silver under the twenty planks; two bases under one plank for its two hands, and two bases under one plank for its two hands. And for the 
other side of the Habitation, at the corner of the north, twenty planks; and their forty bases of silver; two bases under one plank, and two bases under one plank. And for the two legs of the Habitation 
toward the sea thou shalt make six planks. And two planks shalt thou make for the corners of the Habitation in the two legs. And they shall be twinned from beneath, and they shall be twinned together 
at the head of it unto one ring; thus shall it be for them both; they shall be at the two corners. And there shall be eight planks, and their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under one plank, 
and two bases under one plank. And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the planks of the one side of the Habitation, and five bars for the planks of the other side of the Habitation, and 
five bars for the planks of the side of the Habitation at the two legs toward the sea. And the middle bar in the middle of the planks shall pass through from extremity to extremity. And thou shalt 
overlay the planks with gold, and make their rings of gold, houses for the bars; and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. And thou shalt set up the Habitation according to the method which thou wast 
made to see in the mountain. "And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation" signifies the good which supports this heaven; "of shittim wood" signifies that it is the good of merit from the Lord's 
Divine Human; "ten cubits shall be the length of a plank" signifies this good the all in all; "and a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank" signifies the truth from which it conjoins, as much 
as is sufficient; "two hands shall there be in one plank" signifies power from it; "combined one to the other" signifies the consequent conjunction of the Lord with those who are in this heaven; "thus 
shalt thou make for all the planks of the Habitation" signifies thus everywhere; "and thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation twenty" signifies the good which supports heaven in every way and

"for its two hands" signifies the consequent power; "and two bases under one plank for its two hands" signifies thus in each and all things; "and for the other side of the Habitation, at the corner 
of the north" signifies toward the exteriors of this heaven where truth is in obscurity; "twenty planks" signifies the good which supports in every way and completely; "and their forty bases of silver" 
signifies there also a full support by means of truth; "two bases under one plank" signifies through conjunction with good; "and two bases under one plank" signifies everywhere; "and for the two 
legs of the Habitation toward the sea" signifies conjunction with heaven where good is in obscurity; "thou shalt make six planks" signifies where good from the Lord's Divine Human is wholly; "and two 
planks shalt thou make for the corners of the Habitation in the two legs" signifies the quality of the conjunction there with good; "and they shall be twinned from beneath, and they shall be twinned together 
at the head of it" signifies conjunction from the exterior and from the interior; "unto one ring" signifies thus endurance; "thus shall it be for them both; they shall be at the two corners" signifies 
a like conjunction everywhere; "and there shall be eight planks, and their bases of silver" signifies support in every way by good through the truth which is from good; "sixteen bases" signifies 
complete support; "two bases under one plank, and two bases under one plank" signifies through the conjunction of truth with good everywhere; "and thou shalt make bars of shittim wood" signifies the 
power of truth from good; "five for the planks of the one side of the Habitation" signifies whereby it looks toward the interiors of heaven where truth is in light; "and five bars for the planks of 
the other side of the Habitation" signifies the power of truth from good whereby it looks toward the exteriors where truth is in obscurity; "and five bars for the planks of the side of the Habitation 
at the two legs toward the sea" signifies the power of truth from good whereby it looks toward this heaven where there is conjunction with good which is in obscurity; "and the middle bar in the middle 
of the planks shall pass through from extremity to extremity" signifies the primary power from which the powers are everywhere continued; "and thou shalt overlay the planks with gold, and make their 
rings of gold, houses for the bars, and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold" signifies a representative of good from which and through which are all things; "and thou shalt set up the Habitation according 
to the method which thou wast made to see in the mountain" signifies toward the quarters according to the states of good and of the derivative truth in the heaven which is represented. </p>

good dwells in obscurity. 'You shall make six boards' means where good from the Lord's Divine Human exists in its fullness. 'And you shall make two boards for the corners of the dwelling-place at 
the two legs' means the essential nature of the joining to good there. 'And they shall be paired from below, and at the same time paired up to its head' means a joining together from without and from 
within. 'Up to one ring' means being thereby held firm. 'Thus it shall be for them both; at the two corners they shall be' means a like joining together everywhere. 'And there shall be eight boards and 
their bases [made] from silver' means support in every respect from good and through truth that springs from good. 'Sixteen bases' means total support. 'Two bases under one board and two bases under 
one board' means through the joining of truth to good everywhere. 'And you shall make bars from shittim wood' means the power of the truth springing from good. 'Five for the boards of one side of the
