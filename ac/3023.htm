<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3023节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3023.</strong>“我要叫你指着耶和华，天上的神和地上的神起誓”表对着至高之物和由此而来之物中的神性所作的最神圣的承诺。 这从“叫人起誓”的含义清楚可知，“叫人起誓”是指发誓承诺。因为叫人起誓无非去承诺，当一个人指着“耶和华，天上的神和地上的神”起誓，也就是对着在上和在下的神性，或也可说，对着至高之物和由此而来之物中的神性承诺时，这承诺是最为神圣的。“耶和华，天上的神”论及主，故表示被称作“父”的耶和华自己，主从祂成孕，因此祂是主的神性本质；因为成孕本身赋予最真正的本质，主通过这本质而拥有自己的存在。在这种情况下，“耶和华，地上的神”就表示被称作“子”的耶和华，因而表示祂的人性本质。当主将人性本质也变成神性时，人性本质便通过这神性本质产生了。因此，“耶和华，天上的神”表示存在于至高之物中的神性，而“耶和华，地上的神”则表示存在于源自至高之物的事物中的神性。然而，主被称作“耶和华，天上的神”凭的是祂在天上的神性；被称作“耶和华，地上的神”凭的是祂在地上的神性。天上的神性也就是那与人同居于其内在的神性，而地上的神性则是那居于其外在的神性。因为人的内在就是他的天，他通过自己的内在与天使联结；而他的外在则是他的地，他通过自己的外在与世人联结（<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="1411.htm">1411</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>节）。人重生后，内在便流入外在，外在则通过内在而存在。由此也可知何为教会的内在，何为教会的外在。</p>

I will make thee swear by Jehovah the God of heaven and the God of the earth. That this signifies a most holy pledging to the Divine which is in the highest and in that which is therefrom, is evident 
from the signification of "causing to swear," as being to pledge by oath; for to cause to swear is nothing else than to pledge; and this is most holy when it is by Jehovah the God of heaven and the God 
of the earth, that is, to the Divine which is above and which is beneath, or what is the same, to the Divine which is in the highest and in that which is therefrom. "Jehovah the God of heaven," being 
said of the Lord, denotes Jehovah Himself who is called the Father, from whom He was conceived, thus who was His Divine Essence; for the conception itself gave the veriest essence from which He was. 
"Jehovah the God of the earth" in this case means Jehovah who is called the Son, thus His Human essence; this came forth from the Divine essence when the Lord made it also Divine. Thus by "Jehovah the 
God of heaven" is signified the Divine that is in the highest; and by "Jehovah the God of the earth" is signified the Divine that is in that which is therefrom. But the Lord is called "Jehovah the 
God of heaven" from His Divine that is in the heavens; and He is called the "God of the earth" from His Divine that is on earth. The Divine in the heavens is also that which is with man in his internals; 
but the Divine on earth is that which is in his externals; for the internals of man are his heaven, because by them he is conjoined with the angels; but his externals are his earth, for by them he 
is conjoined with men (n. 82, 913, 1411, 1733). When a man is regenerate, the internals flow into the externals, and the externals are from the internals. Hence also it may be known what the internals 
of the church are, and what its externals. </p>

'I will make you swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth' means an utterly sacred binding to the Divine which existed in highest things and in the things derived from these. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'making someone swear by' as binding by means of an oath, for to swear by is nothing else than to be bound to; and this bond is utterly sacred when one swears 'by Jehovah, 
the God of heaven and the God of the earth', that is, when one is bound to the Divine above and beneath, or what amounts to the same, to the Divine which exists in highest things and in the things derived 
from these. Since 'Jehovah the God of heaven' is used in reference to the Lord, it means Jehovah Himself, who is called 'the Father', from whom the Lord was conceived and so who was the Lord's 
Divine Essence; for His very conception transmitted that very Essence from which He had His being. 'Jehovah the God of the earth' means in this case Jehovah who is called 'the Son', and so means His Human 
Essence. The Human Essence came into being from the Divine Essence when the Lord made that Human Essence Divine also. Thus 'Jehovah the God of heaven' means the Divine as it exists in highest things, 
while 'Jehovah the God of the earth' means the Divine as it exists in the things derived from these. The Lord however is called 'Jehovah, the God of heaven' by virtue of His Divine in the heavens, 
and 'the God of the earth' by virtue of His Divine on earth. The Divine in the heavens is also that which resides with man in his internals, whereas the Divine on earth is that which does so in his 
externals. For man's internals constitute his 'heaven' because through them he is linked to angels, whereas his externals constitute his 'earth' because through them he is linked to men, <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="1411.htm">1411</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>. When a person has been regenerated his internals flow into his externals, and externals exist from internals. From this one may also know what the internals of the Church are and what its externals. </p>

`Adjurabo te in Jehovam Deum caeli et Deum terrae': quod significet obstrictionem sanctissimam ad Divinum quod in supremis et in illis quae inde, constat a significatione `adjurare' quod sit per juramentum 
obstringere, adjuratio enim non aliud est quam obstrictio, et haec sanctissima cum `in Jehovam Deum caeli et Deum terrae,' hoc est, ad Divinum quod supra et quod supra, seu quod idem, ad Divinum 
quod in supremis et in illis quae inde: `Jehovah Deus caeli' quia dicitur de Domino, est Ipse Jehovah Qui `Pater' {1}vocatur, ex Quo conceptus, ita Qui Divina Ipsius Essentia; ipsa enim conceptio dedit 
ipsissimam Essentiam ex qua fuit; `Jehovah Deus terrae' est tunc Jehovah qui `Filius' dicitur, ita Humana Ipsius Essentia; exstitit haec ab illa cum Dominus eam quoque Divinam fecit; ita significatur 
per `Jehovam Deum caeli' Divinum quod in supremis, et per `Jehovam Deum terrae' Divinum quod in illis quae inde. Dominus autem `Jehovah Deus caeli' dicitur ex Divino Ipsius quod in caelis, et `Deus 
terrae' ex Divino quod in terris; Divinum in caelis etiam est quod apud hominem in internis ejus, Divinum autem in terra est quod in ejus externis; interna enim hominis sunt ejus caelum, quia per illa 
conjunctus est angelis, externa autem ejus sunt terra, nam per illa conjunctus est hominibus, n. 82, 913, 1411, 1733; cum homo regeneratus est, tunc illa influunt in haec, et haec sunt ab illis; inde 
etiam sciri potest quid Ecclesiae interna et quid ejus externa. @1 dicitur$  </p>
