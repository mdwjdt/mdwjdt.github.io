<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10736</strong>.后来我意识到，就我的灵而言，我在星空之中，远在我们太阳系之外；这一点能从状态的变化和由此而来的看似持续约十个小时的行程明显可知。我最终听见灵人在我后来所看见的某个星球附近说话。当我接近他们时，在一番交谈过后，他们说，别处的访客有时造访他们；这些访客跟他们谈论神，却混淆了他们的思维观念。他们还向我指出这些访客到来的途径，我由此意识到，他们是属于我们地球的一些灵人。当问他们这些访客以哪种方式混淆他们时，他们回答说，这些访客告诉他们，人们要信分为三个位格的一位神性，但他们仍将这三个位格称作一位神。当他们调查这些访客的思维观念时，这种观念却呈现为彼此不同且分离的三位，而不是从一个进入另一个的连续的三位；在有些人那里则呈现为彼此交谈的三个位格；尽管他们称每个位格为神，并且对每一个都持有不同的观念，但仍说他们是一位神。与我交谈的灵人们怨声载道地说，这些访客他们搞糊涂了，因为他们思想三位，却又说一位；而事实上，他们所说的应该与他们所想的相符。当时，他们也调查了陪同我的那位传教士对一位神和三个位格持守哪种观念。他脑海中的画面描绘了三位神，但他通过把他们从一个继续到另一个而变成一位；然而，他头脑中的观念将这种三位一体表现为一个因是神性故是不可见的实体。当这种观念表现出来时，人们认识到，他只思想父，不思想主，他对一位不可见的神的观念无非是对在其初始中的自然界的观念。因此，自然界至内在的组成部分就是他的神。要记住，在来世，每个人对任何事物的思维观念都活生生地呈现出来，每个人的信仰的性质都通过这种呈现被调查。还要记住，每个人对神的思维观念是最重要的观念；如果这些观念是纯正的，与天堂的结合就会通过它们实现，因为是神性构成了天堂。</p>

I afterward discerned that in respect to my spirit I was in the starry heaven far beyond the world of our sun, for this could be discerned from the changes of state and the consequent apparent continuous 
progression during almost ten hours. At last I heard spirits speaking who were near some earth, which I afterward saw. When I approached them, after some conversation, they said that they are sometimes 
visited by guests from a distance who speak to them about God, and confuse the ideas of their thought. They also showed the way by which they come, from which it was perceived that they were spirits 
from our earth. And when they were asked in what they had confused them, they said by their telling them that it is necessary to believe in a Divine that is distinguished into three Persons, which 
they nevertheless call one God. And when the idea of their thought is examined, it appears as a Trine that is not continuous but discrete; and with some as three Persons conversing together; and although 
they call each Person "God," and have a different idea of each, they nevertheless say "one God." They greatly complained that these guests confuse them by thinking of three and saying one, when 
yet they ought to think as they speak, and speak as they think. The preacher who was with me was then also examined in respect to the idea which he had of one God and three Persons. He represented three 
Gods, yet these a one by continuity, but he set forth this trinal one as invisible because Divine. And when he set this forth it was perceived that he was then thinking of the Father only, and not 
of the Lord, and that his idea of an invisible God was nothing but an idea of nature in its first principles, the result of which was that the inmost of nature was to him his Divine. Be it known that 
in the other life the idea of everyone's thought on any subject is presented to the life, and that by this everyone is examined in respect to the nature of his faith; and also that the idea of thought 
concerning God is the principal of all; for by this idea, if it be genuine, conjunction is effected with heaven, because it is the Divine which makes heaven. </p>

After I had realized that I was as to my spirit out in space, far beyond our solar system - for this could be recognized from the changes of state and resulting movement onwards that was evident, lasting 
continuously for almost ten hours - I eventually heard spirits talking near to some planet, which I afterwards saw. When I came near them they said, after we had been talking together for a while, 
that on occasion they have visitors from somewhere else who talk to them about God and confuse the ideas in their minds. They also showed me the way by which those visitors come, from which I realized 
that they were some spirits belonging to our own planet. And when asked in what way those visitors had confused them they replied, By their saying that people should believe in a Deity distinguished 
into three persons, whom they nevertheless call one God. And when they investigate what is in the visitors' minds this presents itself not as three continuing from one into another but as three distinct 
and separate from one another; and in some minds they are seen as three persons talking among themselves, one to another. And although they call each person God and have a different idea of each 
they nevertheless say they are one God. The spirits conversing with me complained bitterly that the visitors confused them by their thinking three and saying one, when in fact what people think ought 
to match what they say, and what they say ought to match what they think. At that time they also investigated the kind of idea that the preacher accompanying me had regarding one God and three persons. 
The picture in his mind portrayed three gods, who however made one by their continuing from one into another; yet the idea in his mind presented this trinal unity as an entity which, being Divine, was 
invisible. And when this idea presented itself it was recognized that his thought was of the Father alone and not of the Lord, and that he pictured the invisible God as being no more than the forces 
of nature in their first beginnings. Consequently the inmost component of the natural order was his God. It should be remembered that in the next life the ideas contained in a person's mind regarding 
any matter at all present themselves in a visual, true to life way, and that the nature of everyone's belief is investigated by means of this presentation. It should be remembered also that the ideas 
in a person's mind regarding God are the chief ones of all; for through those ideas, if they are sincere, a joining to heaven is effected, since that which is Divine is what constitutes heaven.  </p>

Postquam animadverti me esse in caelo astrifero quoad spiritum longe ultra mundum nostri solis, hoc enim animadverti potest ex mutationibus status et inde apparente progressione continua paene decem 
horarum; tandem audivi spiritus loquentes juxta aliquam tellurem, quae postea mihi visa, ad quos cum appropinquavi, post aliquam collocutionem, dicebant quod ad illos quandoque hospites aliunde {1}veniant 
qui loquuntur cum illis de Deo, et confundunt ideas cogitationis illorum; monstrabant etiam viam per quam veniunt, ex qua perceptum quod essent ex spiritibus e nostra tellure; et cum interrogarentur 
in quo confunderent, aiebant per id quod dicant credendum esse in Divinum distinctum in tres personas, quas usque vocant unum Deum; et cum explorant ideam cogitationum eorum, sistitur illa sicut 
trinum non continuum sed discretum, et apud quosdam sicut tres personae inter se loquentes, unus {2}ad alterum et tametsi unamquamvis personam vocant Deum, et de unaquavis {3}aliam ideam habent, usque 
dicunt unum Deum; questi valde quod per id confundant eos, quod cogitent tres et dicant unum, cum tamen cogitandum sit sicut dicitur, et dicendum sicut cogitatur.  Praedicator qui mecum erat, tunc quoque 
explorabatur qualem ideam de ano Deo et tribus personis haberet; repraesentabat tres deos, {4}at illos unum per continuum, sed sistebat trinum hoc unum ut invisibile quia Divinum, et cum hoc sistebat, 
perceptum est quod tunc modo cogitaret de Patre et non de Domino, et quod idea ejus de Deo invisibili non alia asset quam sicut de natura in suis primis, ex qua resultabat quod intimum naturae ei 
fuerit {5}suum Divinum. Sciendum est quod idea cogitationis cujusvis de quacumque re in altera vita sistatur ad vivum, et quod per id exploretur unusquisque qualis ei fides; et quod idea cogitationis 
de Deo sit principalis omnium, nam per illam, si genuina, conjunctio fit cum caelo; Divinum enim est quod facit caelum. @1 Before quandoque$ @2 ex altero$ @3 distinctam$ @4 ac$ @5 Deus$ </p>
