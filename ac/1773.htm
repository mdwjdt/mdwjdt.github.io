<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1773节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1773.</strong>灵人在世时若以主的圣言为喜乐，那么在来世就会拥有一种令人喜悦的天堂温暖，对此，我也得以体验过。那些拥有某种程度的这种快乐之人的温暖传给了我。它就象春天的热，始于唇部，然后扩散到脸颊，由此扩散到两耳、上升至双眼，再降至胸腔中央。<br />那些被主圣言的快乐，以及主亲自教导的内在事物感染更深之人的温暖也传给了我。它始于胸腔，由此升至下巴，再降至腰部。那些还要以之为乐，并受感染还要更深之人的温暖具有更内在的喜乐，如春天一般，甚至从腰部向上延伸到胸腔，由此通过左臂扩散到双手。我从天使那里得知，这是千真万确的事实。这些灵人一靠近就会带来这类温暖，尽管他们自己感觉不到，因为他们就在这些温暖里面，就象婴儿、儿童和青少年通常感觉不到自己的温暖比成年人和老年人的更大一样，因为他们就在其中。<br />我还感受过那些虽以圣言为乐，却不渴望理解它之人的温暖。这种温暖只能在右臂被感受到。还有下面这种温暖：恶灵也能通过自己的手段制造一种假冒快乐的温暖，还能将其传给别人。但它纯粹是一种外在温暖，并非源于内在事物。这种温暖会使食物腐烂，并转化为粪便之物，如通奸者和那些沉浸于污秽乐趣之人所具有的温暖。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1773.</strong> Spirits who loved and enjoyed the Lord's Word during their physical life feel a certain pleasant, heavenly warmth in the next life, and this too I was allowed to experience.<br />The spirits who had enjoyed the Word somewhat shared their warmth with me, and it resembled the balmy temperatures of spring. The warmth started in the area of my lips and spread through my cheeks and from there to my ears. It also reached up to my eyes and down toward the middle of my chest.<br />[2] Other spirits felt even more pleasure in the Lord's Word and in the deeper lessons that the Lord himself had taught. The warmth they shared with me was deeper and started in my chest, spreading up toward my chin and down toward my lower abdomen.<br />The warmth of those who felt still more pleasure was still more deeply gratifying and more springlike. It reached from my lower abdomen up to my chest and from there through my left arm to my hand.<br />I was taught by angels that this was the case, and they said that when such spirits come close, they trigger these waves of heat. The spirits themselves do not feel it, however, because they are inside it. The same is common with children, adolescents, and young adults; mostly they are not aware of the fire they have — although they have more than mature adults and old people do — because they are inside it.<br />[3] In addition, I sensed the warmth of those who did enjoy the Word but did not concern themselves with understanding it. The heat was restricted to my right arm.<br />As far as heat goes, evil spirits can also conjure up a type that mimics the pleasurable kind, and they can share it with others, but it is strictly superficial; it has no inner source. This is the kind of heat that turns into something putrid and dunglike — the heat that adulterers and hedonists have. </p>

Spirits who had found delight and joy in the Word of the Lord during their life in the body, have in the other life a kind of joyous heavenly warmth which it has also been permitted me to feel. The warmth 
of those who had some measure of this delight was communicated to me. It was like a vernal heat, beginning in the region of the lips, and diffusing itself about the cheeks, and thence as far as 
the ears, ascending also to the eyes, and descending toward the middle region of the breast.  [2] The warmth of those who had been still more affected by delight in the Word of the Lord, and by the interior 
things of it which the Lord Himself had taught, was also communicated to me; beginning at the breast it ascended thence toward the chin, and descended toward the loins. The warmth of those who 
had been even more delighted and affected, was still more interiorly joyous and vernal, extending indeed from the loins upward toward the breast, and thence through the left arm to the hands. I was instructed 
by the angels that this is really the case, and that the approach of those spirits brings such warmths, although they themselves do not feel them, because they are in them, just as infants, 
children, and youths are not commonly sensible of their own warmth which they have in greater measure than adults and old people, because they are in it.  [3] I was also made sensible of the warmth of 
some, who had indeed been delighted with the Word, but had not been solicitous about the understanding of it; their warmth was felt in the right arm only. As regards the warmth: evil spirits also can 
by their artifices produce a warmth which counterfeits delight, and can communicate it to others; but it is only an external warmth, without an origin from internals. Such warmth is that which putrefies 
and converts food into excrement, like the heat of adulterers, and that of those who have been immersed in filthy pleasures. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1773</b></p><p><b>1773.</b>
Spirits who during their lifetime have taken joyous delight in the Word of the Lord possess in the next life a certain joyous heavenly warmth, which too I have been allowed to feel. The warmth of those 
who had some measure of this delight was communicated to me. It was like the heat of spring-time. Starting in the region of the lips, it spread into the cheeks; from there it spread to the ears and 
also went up to the eyes, as well as down towards the central region of the breast. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The warmth which was communicated to me of those who had taken even greater delight in the Word of the Lord 
and its inner contents which the Lord Himself had taught was more interior. Starting in the breast, it went up from there towards the chin, and also down towards the loins. The warmth of those who have 
taken still greater delight in it and have been stirred by still greater affection for it was even more inwardly delightful and spring-like. Beginning indeed in the loins it rose upwards towards the 
breast, and from there it spread by way of the left arm to the hands. I was informed by the angels that this is what actually happens and that when those spirits draw near, such varieties of warmth are 
felt, though the spirits themselves do not feel them because they are within them, just as infants, children, and young people do not usually feel their own warmth - which they possess in greater measure 
than adults and elderly persons, because they are within that warmth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 I have also felt the warmth of those who, it is true, have taken delight in the Word but who have not been anxious to 
have an understanding of it. This warmth was confined to the right arm. As regards such warmth, evil spirits as well are able by their devices to produce a warmth which counterfeits delight and which 
they can communicate to others. But it is a purely external warmth having no origin in things that are internal. This warmth is such as cools off and becomes something utterly disgusting, as does the 
warmth of adulterers and that of people who have become engrossed in filthy pleasures. </p>

</p><b>1773.</b>
Spiritus qui in vita corporis delectati sunt Verbo Domini cum jucunditate, illi in altera vita habent calorem quendam jucundum caelestem, quem quoque sentire inibi datum est.  Qui aliquantum delectati 
sunt, calor eorum mecum communicatus; erat sicut aestus vernus, incipiens a regione labiorum, et se diffundens circum genas, et inde usque ad aures, et ascendens quoque ad oculos, descendens etiam versus 
mediam pectoris regionem.  [2] Qui adhuc plus affecti sunt delectatione Verbi Domini et ejus interioribus quae Ipse Dominus docuerat, eorum calor mecum communicatus interior erat incipiendo a pectore, 
ascendendo inde versus mentum, et descendendo versus lumbos.  Qui adhuc magis delectati et affecti sunt, calor eorum adhuc interius jucundior, et magis vernus fuit, et quidem a lumbis sursum versus 
pectus, et inde per sinistrum brachium ad manus: instruebar ab angelis quod ita se res habeat, et quod approximatio illorum tales calores sistat, quamvis illi eos non sentiant quia in illis sunt; 
sicut solent infantes, pueri et adolescentes non sentire suum calorem quem habent prae adultis et senibus, quia in illo sunt.  [3] Calor quoque sentitus eorum qui quidem delectati sunt Verbo, sed de 
ejus intellectu non solliciti fuerunt; erat solum in brachio dextro.  Quod calorem attinet, possunt etiam mali spiritus artificiis sui producere calorem qui mentitur jucundum, et eum cum aliis communicare, 
sed est modo calor externus absque origine ab internis; talis calor est qui putrescit, et facessit in excrementitium, sicut calor adulterorum, et illorum qui spurcis voluptatibus immersi sunt. </p>
