<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7993.</strong>出埃及记12:43-49.耶和华对摩西、亚伦说，逾越节的例是这样：外邦人都不可吃它。但各人用银子买的奴仆，你给他行了割礼，他才可以吃。外人和雇工都不可吃。应当在一个房子里吃，不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去。羔羊的骨头一根也不可折断。以色列全会众都要守这礼。若有寄居者寄居在你们中间，愿向耶和华守逾越节，他所有的男子务要受割礼，然后才容他前来遵守，他也就像本地人一样；但未受割礼的人，都不可吃它。本地人和寄居在你们中间的寄居者同归一个律法。<br />“耶和华对摩西、亚伦说”表神之真理所赐予的指示。“逾越节的例是这样”表为那些从诅咒和侵扰中被释放的人所立的秩序律法。“外邦人都不可吃它”表那些没有真理和良善的人要与他们分开。但“各人的奴仆”表至今仍旧属世的人。“用银子买”表他拥有某种属灵真理。“你给他行了割礼”表从污秽的爱中洁净。“他才可以吃”表他要与他们在一起。“外人和雇工都不可吃”表那些出于纯属世的倾向行善的人和那些为了自己的利益行善的人不会与他们在一起。“应当在一个房子里吃”表相一致的良善和谐共存，好叫它们能一起构成一个良善。“不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去”表该良善绝不可与另一种良善掺杂在一起。“羔羊的骨头一根也不可折断”表真理的记忆知识或记忆知识的真理也必然保持完好。“以色列全会众都要守这礼”表这秩序的律法是为所有处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人立的。“若有寄居者寄居在你们中间”表那些已经在教会的真理和良善上接受教导并领受它们的人。“愿向耶和华守逾越节”表如果他想与他们在一起。“他所有的男子务要受割礼”表他的真理必须从不洁的爱中洁净。“然后才容他前来遵守”表然后他才可以与他们在一起。“他也就像本地人一样”表他将作为拥有这真理和良善，已从污秽的爱中洁净之人被接纳。“但未受割礼的人，都不可吃它”表凡陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱的人都不能与他们在一起。“本地人和寄居在你们中间的寄居者同归一个律法”表凡在教会的真理和良善上接受教导，领受它们，并照之生活的人应被视为教会里已经受了教导，并照着信与仁的诫命生活的人。</p>

Verses 43-49. And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the passover; no son of an alien shall eat of it. And every man's servant that is bought with silver, when thou hast circumcised 
him, then shall he eat of it. A lodger and a hireling shall not eat of it. In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not bring out of the flesh abroad from the house; and ye shall not break a bone 
thereof. All the assemblage of Israel shall perform it. And when a sojourner shall sojourn with thee, and performeth the passover to Jehovah, every male of his shall be circumcised, and then let him 
come near to perform it; and he shall be as a native of the land; and no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. One law shall there be for the native, and for the sojourner that sojourneth in the midst 
of you. "And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron," signifies information by means of truth Divine; "This is the statute of the passover," signifies the laws of order for those who are liberated from 
damnation and infestations; "no son of an alien shall eat of it," signifies that those who are not in truth and good are to be separated from them; "and every man's servant," signifies a man who is still 
natural; "that is bought with silver," signifies who has any spiritual truth; "when thou hast circumcised him," signifies purification from unclean loves; "then he shall eat of it," signifies that 
he shall be with them; "a lodger and a hireling shall not eat of it," signifies that they who do what is good from mere natural disposition, and those who do it for the sake of their own advantage, 
are not to be with them; "in one house shall it be eaten," signifies consociations of accordant goods, that they may together make one good; "thou shalt not bring out of the flesh abroad from the house," 
signifies that this good shall not be mixed together with the good of another; "and ye shall not break a bone in it," signifies the truth of memory-knowledge, that this also must be sound; "all the 
assemblage of Israel shall perform it," signifies that this law of order is for all who are in the good of truth and in the truth of good; "and when a sojourner shall sojourn with thee," signifies those 
who have been instructed in the truth and good of the church, and have received them; "and performeth the passover to Jehovah," signifies if he desires to be together with them; "every male of his 
shall be circumcised," signifies that his truth must be cleansed from impure loves; "and then let him come near to perform it," signifies that then he shall be with them; "and he shall be as a native 
of the land," signifies that he shall be received as he who is in that truth and good, and has been purified from unclean loves; "and no uncircumcised person shall eat of it," signifies that he who 
is in the loves of self and of the world cannot be together with them; "one law shall there be for the native, and for the sojourner that sojourneth in the midst of you," signifies that he who on being 
instructed receives the truth and good of the church, and lives according to them, shall be as he who, being already instructed, is within the church, and lives a life in agreement with the precepts 
of faith and of charity. </p>

Verses 43-49 And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the Passover: No son of a foreigner shall eat it. And every man's slave, a purchase paid for with silver,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> when you have circumcised 
him, shall eat it. A stranger and a hired servant shall not eat it. It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not bring any of the flesh outside the house, and you shall not break a bone of it. 
All the assembly of Israel shall keep it. And when a sojourner sojourns with you and would keep the Passover to Jehovah, every male he has shall be circumcised, and then he shall come near to keep it, 
and shall be as if a native of the land. And no uncircumcised person shall eat it. There shall be one law for the native and for the sojourner sojourning in the midst of you.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to 
Moses and Aaron' means instructions given by God's truth. 'This is the statute of the Passover' means the laws of order for those who have been delivered from damnation and molestations. 'No son of 
a foreigner shall eat it' means that those not in possession of truth and good are set apart from them. 'And every man's slave' means the natural man up to now. 'A purchase paid for with silver' means 
who is in possession of some spiritual truth. 'When you have circumcised him' means on being purified from filthy kinds of love. 'Shall eat it' means that he shall be together with them. 'A stranger 
and a hired servant shall not eat it' means that those who are prompted by a merely natural inclination to do good, and those who do it for the sake of gain, shall not be together with them. 'It shall 
be eaten in one house' means compatible forms of good grouped together to compose a single body of good. 'You shall not bring any of the flesh outside the house' means that this good must not be intermingled 
with another's good. 'And you shall not break a bone of it' means that factual knowledge of truth must also remain intact. 'All the assembly of Israel shall keep it' means that this law of order 
is for all who are governed by the good of truth and guided by the truth of good. 'And when a sojourner sojourns with you' means those who have received instruction in the Church's truth and good, 
and have accepted them. 'And would keep the Passover to Jehovah' means if he wishes to be together with them. 'Every male he has shall be circumcised' means that his truth is to be purged from impure 
kinds of love. And then he shall come near to keep it' means that then he shall be together with them. And shall be as if a native of the land' means that he shall be received as one who is in possession 
of that truth and good and who has been purified from filthy kinds of love. And no uncircumcised person shall eat it' means that no one ruled by self-love and love of the world may be together with 
them. There shall be one law for the native and for the sojourner sojourning in the midst of you' means that someone who has received instruction in and accepted the Church's truth and good, and leads 
a life in keeping with them, will be as someone within the Church who has already been instructed and leads a life conforming to the commandments of faith and charity.

Vers. 43-49.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et Aharonem, Hoc statutum Paesach, omnis filius alienigenae non comedet illud.  Et omnis servus viri, emptio argenti, et circumcideris illum, tunc comedet illud. 
 Inquilinus et mercenarius non comedet illud.  In domo una comedetur, non educes e domo de carne foras; et os non frangetis in illo.  Omnis coetus Israelis facient illud.  Et cum peregrinatur tecum 
peregrinus, et faciat Paesach Jehovae, circumcidetur illi omnis masculus, et tunc accedet ad faciendum illud, et erit sicut indigena terrae; et omnis praeputiatus non comedet illud.  Lex una erit 
indigenae et peregrino peregrinanti in medio vestrum.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et Aharonem' significat informationem per verum Divinum: `Hoc statutum Paesach' significat leges ordinis illis qui a 
damnatione et infestationibus liberati: `omnis filius alienigenae non comedet illud' significat illos qui non in vero et bono, quod ab illis separati: `et omnis servus viri' significat hominem naturalem 
adhuc: `emptio argenti' significat cui aliquid verum spirituale: `et circumcideris illum' significat purificationem ab amoribus spurcis: `tunc comedet illud' significat quod cum illis: `inquilinus 
et mercenarius non comedet illud' significat {1}qui ex sola indole naturali bonum faciunt, et qui propter lucrum, quod non cum illis: `in domo una comedetur' significat consociationes bonorum convenientium 
ut faciant unum bonum simul: `non educes e domo de carne foras' significat quod bonum hoc non commiscebitur bono alterius: `et os non frangetis in illo' significat scientificum verum quod etiam 
integrum erit: `omnis coetus Israelis facient illud' significat quod ea lex ordinis omnibus qui in bono veri et in vero boni: `et cum peregrinatur tecum peregrinus' significat illos qui in vero et bono 
Ecclesiae instructi sunt, et receperunt illa: `et faciat Paesach Jehovae' significat si velit una cum illis esse: `circumcidetur illi omnis masculus' significat quod verum illius ab impuris amoribus 
defaecandum sit: `et tunc accedet ad faciendum illud' significat quod tunc cum illis erit: `et erit sicut indigena terrae' significat quod {2}acceptus sicut ille qui in illo vero et bono, et purificatus
