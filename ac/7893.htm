<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7893节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7893.</strong>“这两日之内，无论何工都不可作”表在此期间放弃地上和世界的事物。这从“工”的含义清楚可知，“工”是指以世界和地上的事物为其目的劳动和职业；因此，“这两日之内，无论何工都不可作”表示放弃这类事物。之所以如此严厉地禁止他们在节期和安息日作任何工，是为了在这些场合，一个完全的代表状态，就是代表属天和属灵事物的那类事物能存在于他们当中。如果他们作了任何以世界或地土为目的的那种工作，这种状态就会陷入混乱。因为教会的代表行为建立在雅各的后代当中，是为了通过这些行为，天堂能与人类建立联系，这是教会为之存在的目的。若非以死刑之痛来禁止他们在节日和安息日作任何工，这种联系是不会实现的。事实上，他们的心思被世界和地上的事物牢牢占据，他们全心沉浸于这些事物，因为这是他们的性质。因此，如果他们同时自由地忙于这些事，那么通过代表行为所实现的联系就会被完全切断，不复存在。然而，在后来的时期，这些节日为了在这些场合所体验的天上生活，也为了那时他们所接受、能使他们学习何为信与仁的教导而得以保留。</p>

No work shall be done in them. That this signifies a keeping back then from earthly and worldly things, is evident from the signification of "work," as being labors and occupations which have for their 
end the things of the world and of the earth; consequently by "no manner of work shall be done in them" is signified a keeping back from such things. That it was so severely forbidden to do any work 
on the feasts and sabbaths, was in order that they might then be in a full representative state, that is, in such things as represented heavenly and spiritual things, which state would have been disturbed 
if they had done works that looked to the world and the earth as their end. For the representatives of a church were instituted among the posterity of Jacob to the intent that by means of them 
there might be communication of heaven with man, which is the end for which the church exists. This communication would not have been maintained, unless under the penalty of death it had been forbidden 
them to do any work on the days of the feasts and sabbaths; for their minds were occupied with things worldly and earthly, in which they immersed themselves with the whole heart, such being their nature; 
and therefore if they had been free to busy themselves in these things at the same time, the communication by representatives would have been altogether interrupted and destroyed. But afterward 
the same feasts were retained for the sake of heavenly life at the time, and for the sake of the teaching, that they might then learn what faith and charity are. </p>

'No work shall be done on them' means abstention during that time from earthly and worldly pursuits. This is clear from the meaning of work' as toils and endeavours that have things of a worldly and 
earthly nature in view, and therefore 'no work shall be done on them' means abstention from such pursuits. The reason why they were forbidden so strictly to do any work during feasts and sabbaths was 
in order that on those occasions a complete representative state, that is, the kinds of things that represented celestial and spiritual realities, might exist among them. That state would have been thrown 
into disorder if they had done any kinds of work that had the world or earth in view. For the representative acts of the Church among the descendants of Jacob were established in order that through 
those acts heaven might be put in communication with mankind, the end for which the Church exists. That communication would not have been achieved unless those people had been forbidden under pain 
of death to do any work on feast and sabbath days. For their minds were firmly fixed on worldly and earthly pursuits in which they engrossed themselves with all their heart, since they were worldly and 
earthly themselves. If therefore they had been free at the same time on those days to engage in such pursuits, the communication effected through representative acts would have been completely severed 
and would have ceased to exist. In later times however the same feasts were kept in being for the sake of heavenly life experienced on those occasions, and for the sake of teaching they received then 
which enabled them to learn what faith and charity were. </p>

</p><b>7893.</b>
`Nullum opus fiet in illis': quod significet detentionem tunc a terrestribus et mundanis, constat ex significatione `operis' quod sint labores et studia quae pro fine habent illa quae mundi et telluris 
sunt; inde per quod `nullum opus fiet in illis' significatur detentio a talibus.  Quod tam severe interdictum sit quod nullum opus in festis (c)et sabbatis facerent, erat ut tunc in statu repraesentativo 
pleno essent, hoc est, in talibus quae repraesentabant caelestia et spiritualia; qui status turbatus fuisset si opera {1}fecissent quae spectarent mundum et tellurem ut finem; repraesentativa 
(t)enim Ecclesiae apud Jacobi posteros instituta fuerunt ut per illa communicatio esset caeli cum homine, {2}ob illum finem est Ecclesia; communicatio illa non obtenta fuisset nisi sub poena mortis vetitum 
fuisset aliquod opus facere {3}diebus festorum et sabbatorum; nam illorum animo insidebant mundana et terrestria, quibus se toto corde immergebant, tales enim erant; quare si illis simul vacarent, 
communicatio per repraesentativa prorsus interrumperetur et nulla fieret; postea vero eadem festa retenta fuerunt, propter vitam tunc caelestem, ac propter doctrinam, ut tunc discerent quid fides et 
charitas. 	@1 facerent$ 	@2 sicut fit cum$ 	@3 in festis et sabbathis, nam illis non nisi quam mundana et terrestria cordi erant, (m)quibus se toto corde immergebant, nam tales erant,(n) et sic communicatio 
per repraesentativa prorsus interrumperetur, et nulla fieret.  Postea vero eadem festa retenta fuerunt et celebrata propter doctrinam ut discerent tunc quid fides et charitas et propter vitam 
tunc coelestem$ </p>
