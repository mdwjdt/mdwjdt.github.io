<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5057节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5057.</strong>有一次我看见一个大石臼，旁边站着一个人，手里拿着一个铁器。他出于幻觉以为自己锤打石臼里的人，以可怕的方式折磨他们。他以自己所行的为极大快乐，这种快乐被传给我，使我能了解它的性质，以及它在这种人里面何等强烈。这是一种地狱的快乐。天使告诉我，这就是在雅各后代当中占据主导地位的快乐。他们感觉再没有比残忍对待外邦民族，将他们所杀之人曝尸荒野，任由野兽和飞禽吞食，用铁耙和铁斧活生生地把他们砍成碎片，或叫他们经过砖窑（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下12.31.htm">12:31</a>），还击打小孩子，把他们扔在地上。这种事从来就没有被吩咐过，也从来没有任何人被允许如此行，除了扭了大腿筋的人外（<a href="5051.htm">5051</a>节）。这类灵人就住在右脚跟之下，住在那里的奸淫者也是残忍的。<br />有鉴于此，令人震惊的是，竟然有人以为这个民族优先其他民族而蒙拣选。正因相信他们是如此蒙拣选的，所以许多人仍确信这个观念：人的生活无济于事；因此，被接纳进入天堂是靠着纯粹的怜悯，无论人过着怎样的生活。然而，凡理性正常的人都能看出，以这种方式思考违背神性，因为神性是怜悯本身；因此，如果获得天堂是靠着纯粹的怜悯，而不关心生活，那么人人都会被接纳，无论有多少人。在有可能将人接入天堂的情况下，却将他扔进地狱，让他在那里受折磨，这不是怜悯，而是怜悯的对立面；优先于另一个而拣选这一个不是公义，而是公义的对立面。<br />因此，那些以为并确信有些人被拣选，其余的未被拣选的观念，以及被准许进入天堂是靠着纯粹怜悯的观念，无论他们过着怎样的生活之人大多是那种过着邪恶生活的人。如我有几次所耳闻目睹的，这些人被告知，主从不拒绝任何人进入天堂，他们若愿意，就能凭经历知道这一点。为此，他们被提入某个天堂社群，住在那里的人都生活在对良善的情感中，也就是过着仁爱的生活。但是，一到那里，他们就因邪恶而开始遭受折磨和内心的痛苦，因为他们的生活与天堂的生活相反。当天堂之光照在他们身上时，他们在这光中看上去就像魔鬼，几乎完全不成人形。有的脸陷了下去，有的全都是牙齿，就像柳条箱，有的又不同，看上去就像怪物。他们因此而憎恶自己，被自己吓到，一头栽入地狱；并且对他们来说，地狱越深越好。 </p>

A large mortar was seen, and standing by it a man with an iron instrument, who from phantasy seemed to himself to pound men in that vessel, torturing them in direful ways. This he did with great delight, 
which was communicated to me, that I might know the quality and intensity of it in those who are of this nature. It was an infernal delight. I was told by angels that such was the ruling delight 
with the posterity of Jacob; and that they perceived nothing more delightful than to treat the nations with cruelty, to expose them when slain to be devoured by wild beasts and birds, to cut them alive 
with saws and axes, to make them pass through the brick-kiln (2 Sam. 12:31), and to dash their little children together and throw them away. Such things were never commanded, nor were they ever permitted 
except to those the nerve of whose thigh was out of joint (n. 5051). Such spirits dwell under the right heel, where are adulterers who are also cruel.  [2] It is therefore surprising that anyone 
should ever have believed that that nation was chosen more than others; and from this also many confirm themselves in the idea that the life effects nothing, but that election, and hence reception into 
heaven, is of mere mercy, whatever the life may have been; when yet everyone from sound reason may see that to think in this way is contrary to the Divine, for the Divine is mercy itself, and therefore 
if heaven were of mere mercy without regard to the life, everybody would be received. To thrust down anyone into hell to be tormented there, when it would be possible to receive him into heaven, 
would be unmercifulness and not mercy; and to elect one in preference to another would be injustice, and not justice. [3] Wherefore they who have believed and have confirmed themselves in the idea that 
some are elected, and the rest not, and that admission into heaven is of mere mercy, without regard to the life, are told (as I have several times heard and seen) that heaven is never denied by the 
Lord to anyone, and that if they desire they may know this from experience. For this purpose they are taken up into some society of heaven where are those who have lived in the affection of good, or 
in charity; but being evil, as soon as they come there they begin to be tormented and to be inwardly tortured, because their life is contrary; and when the heavenly light appears, they appear in it like 
devils, almost devoid of human form, some with the face sunken, some like grates of teeth, and some monstrous in other ways. Thus they abhor themselves, and cast themselves down headlong into hell, 
and for them the deeper the better. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5057</b></p><p><b>5057.</b>
I once saw a mortar, standing by which there was a man who had an instrument made of iron. In his delusion the man thought he was pounding human beings in the mortar, tormenting them dreadfully. He took 
great delight in what he was doing, and that delight was communicated to me to enable me to know the nature of it and how strong it was in people of his kind. It was a hellish delight, and angels 
told me that it was the kind that reigned among the descendants of Jacob. These never felt more delighted than when they could treat gentile nations in a cruel fashion, exposing those they had slain to 
be devoured by wild animals and by birds, cutting up with saws and axes those who were still alive, and making them pass through the brickkiln, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2012:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 12:31</a>, also striking little children and hurling 
them to the ground. No one has ever been commanded to behave in these ways, nor has anyone ever been permitted to do so other than the kind of people in whom the nerve in the thigh has been put out 
of joint, <a href="5051.htm">5051</a>. Such spirits live beneath the right heel, where the adulterers who are also cruel dwell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In view of this it is astonishing that anyone should ever believe that that nation was chosen 
or elected in preference to any other one. Believing that they were so elected many people go on to convince themselves of the idea that one's life is of no consequence at all but that election 
and consequent acceptance into heaven is attributable to mercy alone, irrespective of the life one has led. Yet anyone of sound reason can see that to think in that way is to think contrary to the Divine. 
The Divine is mercy itself, and therefore if the attainment of heaven were attributable to mercy alone irrespective of the life one leads, all would be accepted, no matter how many these might be. 
To thrust anyone down into hell to suffer torment there, when it was possible for him to be received into heaven, would not be mercy but the opposite of mercy, and to elect one in preference to another 
would not be righteousness but the opposite of righteousness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Consequently those who have believed and convinced themselves of the idea that some have been elected and the rest have not been 
elected, also of the idea that admittance into heaven is attributable solely to mercy regardless of the life they have led, have been for the most part the kind of people who have led evil lives. These 
are told, as I have also heard and seen on several occasions, that the Lord never refuses anyone entrance into heaven, and that if they like they can find this out from experience. They are therefore 
raised up into some community of heaven whose inhabitants have led their lives under the influence of an affection for good, that is, they have led charitable lives. But when those raised up arrive 
there they begin, being evil, to suffer pain and inner torment because their life is contrary to that of heaven. And when heavenly light shines on them they look in that light like devils that are almost 
wholly devoid of human appearance. Some have sunken faces; some are all teeth, looking like crates; and some, who are different again, look like monsters. Thus they are horrified at themselves and 
hurl themselves headfirst into hell; and the deeper they can go, the better it is for them. </p>

Visum est mihi vas trituratorium, et ei adstitit vir quidam cum ferreo instrumento, qui ex phantasia sibi videbatur in vase illo triturare homines cruciando illos diris modis; hoc vir ille faciebat 
cum magna jucunditate; ipsa jucunditas communicabatur ut scirem qualis et quanta esset illis qui tales sunt; erat jucunditas infernalis; dicebatur mihi ab angelis quod talis jucunditas regnaverit 
apud Jacobi posteros, et quod illi nihil jucundius perceperint quam crudeliter tractare gentes, illos occisos feris et avibus devorandos exponere, serris et securibus vivos secare, per fornacem lateritiam 
mittere, 2 Sam. xii 31, infantes collidere et projicere; talia nusquam mandata fuerunt {1}, nec usquam permissa nisi talibus quibus nervus femoris luxatus est, {2}n. 5051; </p>
<p>habitant tales 
sub calcaneo dextro, ubi adulteri qui quoque crudeles.  [2] Mirum itaque est quod usquam aliquis credat quod gens illa prae aliis electa fuerit; inde etiam est quod plures confirment se in eo quod 
vita nihil faciat, sed quod electio sit et inde receptio in caelum sit ex sola misericordia, qualiscumque vita fuerit; cum tamen quisque ex sana ratione videre potest quod ita cogitare sit contra Divinum; 
Divinum enim est ipsa misericordia, quapropter si caelum foret ex sola misericordia, qualiscumque vita (o)sit, omnes quotcumque sunt, {3} reciperentur; detrudere aliquem in infernum ut ibi 
crucietur, cum tamen recipi posset in caelum, foret immisericordia et non misericordia, ac eligere unum prae alio foret injustitia et non justitia.  [3] Quapropter qui crediderunt et se confirmarunt 
in eo quod aliqui electi sint et reliqui non electi, et quod in caelum sit solum admissio ex misericordia utcumque vixerunt, [(m)fuerunt utplurimum tales, qui malam vitam egerunt (n)], illis dicitur 
quod etiam aliquoties audivi et vidi, quod nusquam {4} alicui negetur caelum a Domino, et si cupiunt, quod possint ab experientia id scire; quapropter elevantur in societatem quandam caeli, ubi 
illi qui in affectione boni seu in charitate vitam egerunt; at cum illuc veniunt, tunc, quia mali {5}, incipiunt angi ac intus cruciari, quia vita illis contraria, et cum apparet lux caelestis, illi 
in luce illa apparent sicut diaboli, paene absque forma humana, quidam facie retracta, quidam sicut dentium crates, quidam aliter sicut monstra, ita semet abhorrent, et se dejiciunt praecipites 
in infernum, et quo profundius eo illis melius. </p>
