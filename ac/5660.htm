<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5660节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5660.</strong>“又带下另外的银子在我们手里来买粮”表通过来自另一个源头的真理获得良善的意向。这从“银子”和“带下”的含义清楚可知。“银子”是指真理，如前所述（<a href="5657.htm">5657</a>节）；由于“银子”表示真理，故“另外的银子”表示另外的真理，因而表示来自另一个源头的真理；由于从主而来的，只有纯正的真理，祂将这真理白白赐下，所以真理本身并非来自其它源头。“带下”表示获得的意向，即获得他们要买的谷子所表示的真理之良善的意向。字面上的历史意义暗示，另外的银子也到了约瑟这里，以便从他那里买粮；因此，这银子并非来自其它任何源头。但内义不受字面上的历史意义限制，因为内义不关注字义，只关注正在论述的主题；这主题就是，他们若因外层属世层中的某些真理已白白赐下而要如同奴隶那样顺服，就会通过来自某个其它源头的真理获得良善。这种观念也形成了内义上的思路，因为紧接着经上说“不知道谁把银子放在我们的口袋里”，以此表示他们缺乏信仰，因为他们不知道存在于外层属世层中的真理来自何处。<br />类似这样的事就发生在来世那些正通过真理被引入良善的灵人中间，他们尤其被引入这一事实：一切良善与真理皆从主流入。当他们获知他们所思想或意愿的一切皆流入他们，以致他们凭自己并没有思想和意愿的能力时，就会尽可能地抵制这种观念。因为他们以为，如果这种观念是真的，他们就不可能有自己的生命，一切快乐由此被毁；事实上，他们将这快乐置于他们自己的东西，或说认为独立自我的存在对快乐来说是至关重要的。此外，这些灵人认为，他们若凭自己完全没有能力行良善、信真理，必会撒手，不去主动做或思考任何事，而是等候流注。他们被允许如此思考，直到他们几乎决定他们不想从这种流注那里获得良善与真理，而是从某个不会使他们以这种方式丧失其自我的其它源头来获得。有时他们甚至被允许探究他们能在哪里找到这种良善与真理。然后，等到后来他们处处找不到这种良善与真理时，那些正在重生的人就会回来；在自由中选择让主来引导他们的意愿和思维。同时，他们还被告知，他们要接受诸如天使所拥有的天堂自我，以及伴随这自我的永恒祝福和幸福的恩赐。<br />至于这天堂的自我，这自我是主所赋予的新意愿的产物，不同于适合 人自己的自我，因为那些获得天堂自我的人不再在他们所行的每一件事上，或他们所学习或传授给其他人的每一件事上只看见、关注自己；而是看见、关注邻舍、大众、教会、主的国度，由此看见、关注主自己。经历改变的，是生活的目的。关注低级事物，也就是自我和世界的目的被除去；关注高级事物的目的则被引入以取代它们。生活的目的无非是人的生命本身，因为人的目的就是他的意愿和渴望。它们也是人的爱，因为人所爱的就是他的意愿所渴望，并构成其目的的。<br />被赋予天堂自我的人也会享有宁静和平安的状态，因为他信靠主，相信邪恶不会触及他，也知道强烈的恶欲不能侵扰他。此外，那些获得天堂自我的人享有真正的自由；事实上，被主引导就是自由，因为那时，他们在良善的气场里面被良善引导，并被引向良善。由此明显可知，他们享有祝福和幸福，因为根本没有任何东西，包括爱自己，因而敌意、仇恨或报复，以及爱世界，因而欺诈、害怕或不安能干扰他们。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5660</b></p><p><b>5660.</b>
And other silver have we brought down in our hand to buy food. That this signifies that there is a disposition to procure good by means of truth from another source, is evident from the signification 
of "silver," as being truth (of which just above, n. 5657); and as by "silver" is signified truth, by the "other silver" is signified other truth, consequently truth from another source (as there is 
no genuine truth but that which is from the Lord, who bestows it gratuitously, so truth itself is from no other source); and from the signification of "bringing down," as being a disposition for procuring, 
namely, the good of truth which is signified by the corn they were to buy. The historical sense of the letter implies that the other silver also came to Joseph to buy food from him, and therefore 
did not come from any other source. But the internal sense does not abide in the historical sense of the letter, for which it does not care, but abides in the subject that is being treated of; and the 
subject is, that if they were to be subjected as servants because some truths in the exterior natural had been bestowed gratuitously, they would procure good by means of truth from some other source. 
Such also is the series in the internal sense, for it is presently said, "We know not who put our silver in our bags," by which is signified that they would not believe, because they did not know what 
was the source of the truth in the exterior natural. [2] Something similar takes place in the other life with spirits who are being initiated into good by means of truths, and especially into this 
one-that all good and truth flow in from the Lord. When they perceive that everything they think and will flows into them, thus that they have no power to think and to will from themselves, they resist 
as much as they can, believing that if this were so they would have no life of their own, and thereby that all delight would perish, for they vest this in what is their own. Besides, if they cannot 
do good or believe truth of themselves, they suppose they should let go their hands, doing and thinking nothing from themselves, and should wait for influx.  They are permitted to think so, even to 
the extent of almost coming to the conclusion that they do not desire to receive good and truth from this source, but from some other by which there would not be such a loss of what is their own; and 
sometimes it is given them to inquire where they may find it. Yet afterward when they find it nowhere, those who are being regenerated come back, and in freedom choose to be led by the Lord in their 
willing and thinking. They are then informed that they will receive an own that is heavenly, such as angels have, and with this own, also blessedness and happiness to eternity.  [3] As regards the own 
that is heavenly, this comes forth from the new will that is given by the Lord, and differs from the man's own in the fact that they who have it no longer regard themselves in each and all things they 
do, and in each and all things they learn or teach; but they then have regard to the neighbor, the public, the church, the Lord's kingdom, and thereby to the Lord Himself. It is the ends of life that 
are changed. The ends that look to lower things, that is, to self and the world, are removed, and ends that look to higher things are substituted in their place. The ends of life are nothing else than 
the man's life itself, for they are his very will and loves, because what a man loves he wills and has for his end. He who is gifted with an own that is heavenly is also in quietude and in peace; 
for he trusts in the Lord, and believes that nothing of evil will reach him, and knows that concupiscences will not infest him. And besides, they who are in the heavenly own are in freedom itself; for 
to be led by the Lord is freedom, because they are led in good, by good, to good. From this it is evident that they are in blessedness and happiness, for there is nothing that disturbs them, nothing 
of the love of self, consequently nothing of enmity, hatred, and revenge; nor is there anything of the love of the world, consequently nothing of fraud, of fear, of unrest. </p>

'And we are causing other silver to come down in our hand to buy food' means that the mind is set on acquiring good through truth from some other source. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as 
truth, dealt with just above in <a href="5657.htm">5657</a>, and as 'silver' means truth, some other truth and therefore truth from some other source is meant by 'other silver' (for no other truth that is genuine truth exists 
apart from that received from the Lord, who gives it freely, so that there is no other source than He from which real truth is derived); and from the meaning of 'causing to come down' as a mind set 
on acquiring - on acquiring the good of truth, which is meant by the grain they bought. The story told in the sense of the letter implies that the other silver came to Joseph, for the purchase of food 
from him and so from no other source. But the internal sense is not subject to any limitation set by the story told in the sense of the letter indeed it is not concerned with that sense, only with 
the real matter under discussion here, which is this: If they were to make themselves subservient like slaves owing to the fact that some truths were freely given within the exterior natural, they would 
from some other source acquire good through truth. This idea also forms the train of thought in the internal sense, for immediately after this the words 'we do not know who put the silver in our pouches' 
are used, meaning their lack of belief because they did not know where truth present in the exterior natural came from. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Something like this happens in the next life in the case of spirits 
who are being introduced by means of truths into good, especially into this - that everything good and true flows in from the Lord. When they learn that everything they think or will flows into them, 
so that they themselves cannot be the source of their thinking and willing, they fight all they can against the idea. For they believe that, if this idea is true, they cannot have any life within themselves 
that is entirely their own and that all delight is therefore destroyed, for they make the existence of separate selfhood vital to delight. Furthermore those spirits think that if they do not 
have any power entirely their own to do what is good and to believe what is true, they must let their hands hang down, not do or think anything on their own initiative, and wait for influx. They are allowed 
to go on thinking in this kind of way until they reach the point when they almost decide that they do not want to receive what is good and true from such influx but from some other source which 
does not involve their being deprived in this manner of their selfhood. Sometimes they are even allowed to make enquiries about where they may find that kind of goodness and truth. But when after this 
they do not find such goodness and truth anywhere, those who are being regenerated come back and freely choose to let the Lord lead their will and thought. They are also told at the same time that they 
are going to receive a heavenly selfhood such as the angels possess, and along with this the gift of everlasting bliss and happiness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards this heavenly selfhood, it is a product of the 
new will conferred by the Lord. It is different from the selfhood properly man's own, in that those who have received that heavenly selfhood no longer see only themselves in every single thing they 
do or in every single thing they learn about and convey to others. Instead they see their neighbour, the general public, the Church, the Lord's kingdom, and so the Lord Himself. The ends they have in 
life are what undergo change; for ends which have lower things - namely self and the world - in view are removed and higher ones introduced to replace them. Ends in life are nothing else than the actual 
life in a person, for a person's ends in view are the things that his will desires. They are also the actual loves present in him, for what a person loves is what his will desires and what constitute 
his end in view. The person who is given a heavenly selfhood enjoys too a state of serenity and peace, for he trusts in the Lord and believes that no evil at all can come to touch him, knowing too 
that no strong evil desires can molest him. More than that, those who have received a heavenly selfhood enjoy true freedom; for being led by the Lord constitutes freedom since one is then led within 
the sphere of good, from good, and to good. From this it becomes clear that they enjoy bliss and happiness, for nothing exists to disturb them - no self-love at all, consequently no enmity, hatred, or 
vengeance at all; nor any love of the world at all, consequently no deceitfulness, fear, or unease at all. </p>

`Et argentum alterum descendere facimus in manu nostra {1}ad emendum cibum':  quod significet quod animus sit per verum aliunde comparare bonum, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod  sit verum, 
de qua mox supra n. 5657, et quia per `argentum' significatur verum, per `argentum alterum' significatur verum  aliud, inde significatur verum aliunde; quia non aliud verum  datur quod genuinum, quam 
a Domino Qui gratis donat, ita nec aliunde ipsum verum; et ex significatione `descendere facere' quod sit animus comparandi, nempe bonum veri quod per `frumentum  quod emerent',  significatur; sensus 
litterae historicus  involvit quod argentum alterum etiam veniret ad Josephum, ad emendum ab illo cibum, sic non aliunde; at sensus internus non manet in sensu litterae historico, hunc sensum non curat, 
sed in ipsa re de qua agitur, quae res est, {2} si ut servi subjicerentur {3}propterea quod aliqua vera in (t)naturali exteriori gratis donata sunt quod aliunde compararent sibi bonum per verum; (m)talis 
etiam est series in sensu interno, nam mox dicitur `non scimus quis posuit argentum in manticis nostris', per quae significatur quod non crederent {4}quia non scirent a quo verum in naturali exteriore.(n) 
[2]Similiter existit in altera vita apud spiritus qui {5}per vera initiantur in bonum, et imprimis in hoc, quod omne bonum et verum a Domino influat, {6}et cum appercipiunt quod influat omne 
quod cogitant et volunt, et sic quod a se cogitare et velle non possint, tunc repugnant quantum possunt, {7}credunt {8}quod sic vita propria illis nulla foret, et sic quod periret omne jucundum, nam 
hoc in proprio ponunt; ac insuper, si non (t)possent agere bonum (c)a se nec credere verum a se, quod remitterent manus, nihil ex se agendo et cogitando, et exspectarent influxum; ita cogitare illis 
permittitur {9} etiam in tantum ut paene concludant apud se quod non {10}velint inde bonum et verum accipere sed aliunde, ubi non talis orbatio proprii est; etiam quandoque datur illis inquirere ubi 
id inveniant; at postea, cum nullibi inveniunt, illi qui regenerantur, redeunt et ex libero eligunt quoad velle et cogitare duci a Domino; informantur etiam tunc quod accepturi sint proprium caeleste 
quale est angelis, et cum hoc proprio etiam beatum et felix in aeternum.  [3]Quod proprium caeleste {11}attinet, hoc ex nova voluntate, quae datur a Domino, existit, et differt a proprio hominis, in 
eo quod non magis spectent se in omnibus et singulis quae agunt, {12}ac in omnibus et singulis quae discunt et docent, sed quod tunc spectent proximum, publicum, Ecclesiam, regnum Domini, et sic Ipsum 
Dominum; fines vitae sunt qui mutantur, fines {13}spectandi inferiora, nempe (t)mundum et semet, removentur, et fines {14}spectandi superiora, loco illorum substituuntur; fines vitae non aliud sunt quam 
ipsa vita hominis, nam fines sunt ipsum velle hominis et sunt ipsi ejus amores, nam quae homo amat, haec vult et pro fine habet; qui proprio caelesti donatur, is etiam in tranquillo est et in pace, 
nam fidit Domino et credit quod nihil mali illum attingat, et novit quod concupiscentiae illum non infestent; et praeterea qui in proprio caelesti sunt, in ipso libero sunt, nam duci a Domino est liberum, 
ducitur enim in bono, a bono, ad bonum; {15}inde constare potest quod sint in beato et felici, nam nihil est quod turbat, non aliquid amoris sui, {16}consequenter non aliquid inimicitiae, odii, 
vindictae, nec aliquid amoris mundi, consequenter non aliquid fraudis, timoris, {17}irrequiei.   @1 A I here o$ @2 i quod$ @3 quia$ @4 et quia nec$ @5 initiantur in vera et per veri$ @6 at$ @7
