<p><strong>[NCE]1885.</strong> These two types of visions are unusual, however. They were demonstrated to me simply for the purpose of teaching me what they are like. All the sights you find reported, by the Lord's divine mercy, at the beginning or end of each chapter in these first two volumes are ordinary ones. They are not visions but sights that I have seen for many years now in full physical consciousness. <br />
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1885</b></p><p><b>1885.</b>
These two kinds of visions, however, are extraordinary, and were shown me merely to the end that I might know their nature. But the things I have habitually "seen" [as mentioned in the title to this 
work] are all those which of the Lord's Divine mercy you may see related in this First Part, and which are placed at the beginning and end of the several chapters. These are not visions, but things seen 
in the highest wakefulness of the body, and this for several years.* </p>
<p>Preface [to Volume 2 of the Original Latin] </p>
<p>     In the First Part of this work fifteen chapters of Genesis have been explained, 
and the things contained in the internal sense have been stated; and to each chapter there have been added things that of the Lord's Divine mercy I have been permitted to see and hear in the world 
of spirits and in the heaven of angels. The Second Part** now follows, and in this likewise similar things will be added to the several chapters. To this sixteenth chapter will be appended such as 
relate to Visions and Dreams, including those of a prophetical character found in the Word. I know that few will believe that anyone can see things that exist in the other life, and bring therefrom 
any report respecting the state of souls after death, for few believe in the resurrection, and fewer of the learned do so than of the simple. With the lips indeed they say that they will rise again, because 
so to speak is according to the doctrine of their faith, but still they deny it in heart.  [2] Some go so far as to say openly that if anyone were to rise from the dead and they were to see, hear, 
and touch him, then they would believe. But if this were done, it would have to be done for each individual, and still no such person as denies in heart would be persuaded by it, for thousands of 
objections would flow in that would harden his heart in denial. Some however say that they believe that they will rise, but on the day of the last judgment; and respecting this they have formed the opinion 
that all things in the visible world will then perish, and because that day has been expected in vain for so many centuries they too are in doubt. But what is meant by the last judgment spoken 
of in the Word shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be briefly told at the end of the seventeenth chapter.  [3] From this we may see what kind of people there are in the Christian world at this day. The 
Sadducees (of whom we read in Matt. 22:23, etc.) openly denied the resurrection, but did better than those at the present day who say they do not deny it because it is according to the doctrine of faith, 
as said above, and yet do deny in heart; so that they say what is contrary to what they believe, and believe what is contrary to what they say. But lest they should confirm themselves further in this 
false opinion, of the Lord's Divine mercy I have been permitted, while still in the body in this world, to be in the spirit in the other life (for a man is a spirit clothed with a body), and to speak 
there with souls who had risen not long after their death, in fact with nearly all with whom I have been acquainted in the life of the body, and who have died. For some years also I have been permitted 
to speak with spirits and angels every day, and to see amazing things there, which have never come into anyone's idea, and this without any fallacious appearance.  [4] As very many say that they 
will believe if anyone comes to them from the other life, it will now be seen whether they will be persuaded against the hardness of their hearts. This I can aver, that they who come into the other 
life from the Christian world are the worst of all, hating the neighbor, hating faith, and denying the Lord (for in the other life hearts speak, not mouths), besides the fact that above all others are 
they addicted to adultery. And because heaven is thus beginning to be removed from those who are within the church, we can see that its last time is at hand; the truth of which I have been permitted 
to know with certainty.      Concerning the internal sense of the Word, what it is, and what is its nature, see what has been said and shown in Part First n. 1-5, 64-66, 167, 605, 920, 937, 1143, 1224, 
1404, 1405, 1408, 1409, 1502 at the end, 1540, 1659, 1756, especially 1767-1777 and 1869-1879, 1783, 1807; and in this Part, n. 1886-1889 inclusive. * The first "Part" or volume of the original Latin 
work, in quarto, published in London in 1749, ends here, and the second "Part" follows. ** Published in London in 1750. </p>

These two types of visions however are out of the ordinary, and I was shown them for the sole purpose of my knowing the nature of them. But the things I have ordinarily seen are all those which, recounted 
in the Lord's Divine mercy, you may see in this first Volume - in the sections placed before and after each chapter. Those experiences are not visions however but things seen when my body has been 
fully awake, and this for several years now.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

<p>PREFACE </p>
<p>[Each chapter in Volume Two of the Latin (Chapters <a href="16.htm">16</a>-<a href="21.htm">21</a>) was published separately. This Preface therefore 
may be said to belong before Chapter <a href="16.htm">16</a> only. Another Preface occurs before Chapter <a href="18.htm">18</a>.] </p>
<p>Volume One consisted of an explanation of fifteen chapters of Genesis, stating what these contain in 
the internal sense. Adjoined to each chapter also were things I have been allowed in the Lord's Divine mercy to see and hear in the world of spirits and in the angelic heaven. Now comes Volume Two in 
which such matters are going to be appended in a similar way to each chapter. That which will be appended to this Chapter <a href="16.htm">16</a> is concerned with 'Visions and Dreams', including those that are prophetical 
which are described in the Word. I know few people will believe that anyone is able to see the things that manifest themselves in the next life and is consequently able to report anything on the state 
of souls after death; for few believe in the resurrection, indeed fewer of the learned than of the simple do so. It is true that they speak of it with their lips, for the reason that the doctrine 
of faith teaches that they will rise again; nevertheless they deny it in their hearts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In fact some go on to declare quite openly that they will not believe it until somebody rises from the dead, 
and they see, hear, and touch that person. If this were to be done however it would have to be done for every individual - though in fact no one like this who is a denier at heart would be persuaded 
by it, but thousands of objections would enter in, which would harden his mind in its negative attitude. Others however say that they will indeed rise again, but on Judgement Day, regarding which they 
have adopted the idea that at that time all things in the visible universe are going to perish. Yet because people have been awaiting that day for so many centuries, they too are in doubt. What is 
meant by the Last Judgement spoken of in the Word will be stated briefly, in the Lord's Divine mercy, at the end of Chapter <a href="17.htm">17</a> below. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it may be seen what people are like in the Christian 
world at the present day. The Sadducees referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:23</a> and following verses openly denied any resurrection, yet they did better than those at the present day who, though they say that 
they do not deny it because, as has been stated, the doctrine of faith teaches it, do nevertheless at heart deny it, so that their words are contrary to their belief, and their belief contrary to their 
words. To prevent them confirming themselves any further in that false notion however I have been allowed, in the Lord's Divine mercy, while still in the physical body in the world, to be in the spirit 
in the next life - for a human being is a spirit clothed with a body. In that world I have been allowed to talk to souls who have risen again not long after their decease. Indeed I have been allowed 
to talk to almost everyone who has died and with whom I was acquainted during their lifetime, and also day by day for several years now to talk to spirits and angels, and to see the remarkable things 
in that world which have never entered anyone's imagination. And in none of these experiences have I been in any way deluded. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Because so many people assert that they will believe if someone 
comes back to them from the next life it now remains to be seen whether, despite the hardness of their hearts, they will be persuaded. This I can say quite definitely, that those entering the next life 
from the Christian world are the worst of all for hating the neighbour, hating faith, and denying the Lord - for in that life what is in the heart declares itself, not what is simply on the lips. They 
are also worse adulterers than all others. And because heaven is thereby beginning to be taken away from those inside the Church, it becomes clear, as I have also been permitted to know quite definitely, 
that the last times are at hand.
