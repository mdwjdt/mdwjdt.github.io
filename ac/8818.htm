<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8818节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8818.</strong>“他们都站在山脚下”表远离属天之爱的良善。这从“西乃山”和“站在山脚下”的含义不清楚可知：“西乃山”是指天堂，因而是指与那里的神性真理联结的神之良善（参看<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）；“站在山脚下”是指远离那良善，或离那良善非常遥远。就内在历史意义而言，此处所表示的以色列民族，这个民族缺乏属天之爱的良善（参看<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>节），因此离它非常遥远；这也解释了为何下面（19:21，22，24，25）所说的话，即：摩西警告百姓，以及祭司不可闯过边界摸山，从而死亡。但就论述那些属于属灵教会之人的内义而言，百姓“站在山脚下”表示他们不可因着自大的自信而升到一个更高的天堂，否则就会死亡（对此，可参看<a href="8794.htm">8794</a>，<a href="8797.htm">8797</a>节）。</p>

And they took their stand in the lower parts of the mountain. That this signifies far from the good of celestial love, is evident from the signification of "Mount Sinai," as being heaven, and thus good 
Divine united to Divine truth there (see n. 8805); and from the signification of "taking their stand in the lower parts" of it, as being far or remote from it. In the internal historical sense the 
Israelitish nation is here meant, which was devoid of the good of celestial love (see above, n. 8788, 8806), and consequently was far from it; and therefore it is also said below that Moses charged the 
people and also the priests not to break through the bounds and touch the mountain and thus die (verses 21, 22, 24, 25). But in the internal sense, wherein those who are of the spiritual church are 
treated of, by their "taking their stand in the lower parts of the mountain," is signified that it was not allowable to ascend to a higher heaven by reason of self-confidence, and that if they ascended 
they would die (concerning which see above, n. 8794, 8797). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8818</b></p><p><b>8818.</b>
'And they stood at the foot of the mountain' means a long way off from the good of celestial love. This is clear from the meaning of 'Mount Sinai' as heaven, and so as God's good united to Divine Truth 
there, dealt with in <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>; and from the meaning of 'standing at the foot of it' as a long way off or far away from that good. The meaning here in the internal historical sense is the Israelite nation, 
which was devoid of the good of celestial love, see above in <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>, <a href="8806.htm">8806</a>, and was therefore a long way off from it, which also accounts for what is said below, in verses 21, 22, 24, 25, that Moses 
warned the people and also the priests not to break through the bounds, nor to touch the mountain, and so die. But in the internal sense, which refers to those belonging to the spiritual Church, the meaning 
of the people's standing at the foot of the mountain is that they were not allowed to go up in arrogant self-confidence to a higher heaven, or if they did they would die, regarding which see <a href="8794.htm">8794</a>, <a href="8797.htm">8797</a>. </p>

`Et constiterunt in inferioribus montis': quod significet longe a bono amoris caelestis, constat ex significatione `montis Sinai' quod sit caelum, et sic bonum Divinum unitum Divino Vero ibi, de qua 
n. 8805, et ex significatione `consistere in inferioribus ejus' quod sit longe seu remote ab illo; intelligitur hic in sensu interno historico gens Israelitica, quae quod absque bono amoris caelestis 
fuerit, videatur supra n. 8788, 8806, et inde quod longe ab illo, quapropter etiam infra {1} dicitur quod Moscheh obtestaretur populum ut et sacerdotes, ne perrumperent terminos, ac tangerent montem, 
et sic {2}morerentur, vers. 21, 22, 24, 25.  In sensu autem interno, in quo agitur de illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, significatur per id quod consisterent in inferioribus montis, quod non liceret 
ad superius caelum ex confidentia ascendere, et si ascenderent quod {3}morituri, de qua re videatur n. 8794, 8797. @1 i iterum$ @2 moriantur$ @3 perituri$ </p>
