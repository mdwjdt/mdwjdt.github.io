<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1451.</strong>“迁到伯特利东边的山”表在爱的属天事物上所取得的进步。这从“山”的含义清楚可知，“山”表属天事物，如前所示（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>节）；从“东边”的含义也清楚可知，“东边”表在爱方面的耶和华自己，祂是东边本身，如前所示（<a href="101.htm">101</a>节等）；从“巴别”的含义也清楚可知，“巴别”表属天事物的知识。属天事物既可与认知一起被植入，也可在没有认知时被植入。从婴幼儿到童年这段时期，没有认知的属天事物被植入，如刚才所述；此后，即从童年到成年这段时期，它们连同认知一起被植入。由于主将进入对属天事物的认知，也就是“伯特利”所指的，故此处经上说，“迁到伯特利东边的山”。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1451.</strong> The fact that moving onto a mountain to the east of Bethel symbolizes development in the heavenly aspects of love is established by the following: A mountain symbolizes what is heavenly, as shown in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1451/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1451/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_796" target=_top>796</a>. The east symbolizes Jehovah himself 钬?who is the true east 钬?and specifically his love, as also shown, in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1451/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101" target=_top>101</a>. And Bethel symbolizes knowledge of heavenly qualities.{*1} Heavenly attributes are instilled in a person both without any accompanying knowledge and with it 钬?the former from infancy to adolescence (as noted just above), but the latter from adolescence to a time of full maturity.<br />Because the Lord was to advance into the knowledge of heavenly matters 钬?knowledge symbolized by Bethel 钬?the present verse says, "He moved from there onto a mountain to the east of Bethel."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Etymologically, Bethel (Hebrew 讘旨值讬转-讗值诇 [b锚峁?'脓l]) means "house of God," as noted below in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1451/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1453:2</a>, and thus can be understood as referring to heaven.

That to be "removed into the mountain on the east of Bethel" signifies the progression of the celestial things of love, is evident from the signification of a "mountain," as being what is celestial, 
as has been shown above (n. 795, 796); and from the signification of "the east," as being Jehovah Himself as to love; for He is the East itself, as has also been shown above (n. 101, and elsewhere); and 
also from the signification of "Bethel," as being the knowledge of celestial things. Celestial things are insinuated into man both without knowledges, and with knowledges; celestial things without 
knowledges from infancy up to childhood, as said just above; but celestial things with knowledges from childhood onward to adult age. And as the Lord was to advance into the knowledges of celestial things, 
which are signified by "Bethel," it is here said that Abram passed over thence to a mountain on the east of Bethel. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1451</b></p><p><b>1451.</b>
'Being removed to the mountain on the east of Bethel means an advance made in the celestial things of love. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a mountain' as that which is celestial, as shown in <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>; from the meaning of 'the east' as Jehovah Himself as regards love, who is the east itself, as has also been shown in <a href="101.htm">101</a> and elsewhere; and also from the meaning of 'Bethel' as knowledge of 
celestial things. Celestial things are implanted both independently of cognitions and together with cognitions. The implantation independently of cognitions occurs during infancy to childhood, as stated 
just above, whereas the implantation of them together with cognitions occurs after that, from childhood into adult life. And since the Lord was to advance into cognitions of celestial things, which 
are meant by 'Bethel', it is said here that 'he removed from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1451</b>
</p><b>1451.</b>
Quod 'transferri in montem ab oriente Betheli' significet progressionem caelestium amoris, constare potest a significatione 'montis' quod sit caeleste, ut ostensum n. 795, 796; aque significatione 'orientis' 
quod sit Ipse Jehovah quoad amorem, Qui est 'ipse oriens, ut quoque ostensum n. 101, et alibi; tum a significatione 'Bethelis quod sit cognitio caelestium.  Caelestia insinuantur homini tam 
absque cognitionibus quam cum cognitionibus; caelestia absque cognitionibus ab infantia usque ad pueritiam ejus, ut mox supra dictum; caelestia autem cum cognitionibus a pueritia dein in adultam aetatem: 
 et quia progressurus Dominus in cognitiones caelestium, quae significantur per 'Bethelem,' hic dicitur quod 'transtulit inde in montem ab oriente Betheli.' </p>
