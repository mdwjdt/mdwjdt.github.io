<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第17章</h4><br />1984.很少有人相信圣言里面有内义，这内义根本没有显明在字义中。他们之所以不相信，是因为内义距离字义，可以说如同天距离地那样遥远。但从第一卷各处的论述明显可知，字义里面就包含这类事物，并且它所代表和表示的奥秘除了主和天使外，无人理解，天使则通过主明白它们。字义与内义的关系就象人的肉体与灵魂的关系。当人在肉体中，并通过肉体之物思考时，他对灵魂几乎一无所知。因为肉体的功能不同于灵魂的，并且如此不同，以至于如果灵魂的功能被揭开，他们必不承认是这样。这种情形与圣言的内在一样：圣言的灵魂，也就是它的生命就在它的内在中，而这些内在唯独关注主，祂的国度和教会，以及人里面属于其国度和教会的事物。当这些内在被关注时，这就是主的圣言。因为此种情况下，有生命本身在其中。这是千真万确的事实，这一点在第一卷中已通过很多事物得以证实，并且也是我得以确知的事。因为牵涉肉体和世俗之物的任何观念决无法传给天使，它们离开人后，在第一道门槛处就脱去，并完全被除去。这一点从第一卷中所提到的记事本身（<a href="1769.htm">1769</a>-<a href="1772.htm">1772</a>节），以及它如何改变（<a href="1872.htm">1872</a>-<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>节）可以看出来。<br />这一点也可从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。从字义上看，这些经文根本无法理解，它们里面若没有这样的灵魂和生命，就不会被视为主的圣言。人若没有从小被灌输圣言是被启示的，因而是神圣的这样的信念，也不会视其为神性。谁能从字义知道雅各临死前对他儿子所说那些话（创世记49）是什么意思？<br />但必作道上的蛇，路中的虺，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的坠落于后。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.17.htm">49:17</a>）<br />迦得必被敌军追逼，他却要追逼他们的脚跟。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.19.htm">49:19</a>）<br />拿弗他利是被释放的母鹿，发出优美的言语。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.21.htm">49:21</a>）<br />犹大把驴驹拴在葡萄树旁，把母驴的崽子拴在上好的葡萄树旁。他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。他的眼睛必因酒红润；他的牙齿必因奶白亮。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.12.htm">12</a>）<br />先知书中很多地方有类似经文。然而，若不借助内义，这些话的意思根本不明显。但在内义中，每一个细节都以最优美的次序被联结起来。<br />主在马太福音中针对末后所说的话也一样：<br />那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。那时，人子的兆头要显在天上，地上的万族都要哀哭。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">24:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">30</a>）<br />这些话根本不是说太阳和月亮变黑了，或众星要从天上坠落，或万族都要哀哭。相反，它们表示，仁与信（日头和月亮的内义）即将以这种方式变黑。它们还表示，对善与真的认知（就是“众星”，它们在此被称为“天势”）即将坠落并消失。它们同样表示信的一切事物，就是“地上的万族”。这在第一卷也予以说明了（<a href="31.htm">31</a>，<a href="32.htm">32</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>节）。<br />从这些事可以看出圣言内义的性质，还能看出，它与字义相去甚远，在某些地方则非常遥远。尽管如此，字义仍代表真理，也阐述真理的表象，因为当人不凭真理之光看见时，他也可以凭真理的表象看见。</p>

Chapter 17 Few persons can bring themselves to believe that the Word has within it an internal sense that from the letter is not apparent, because it is so remote from the sense of the letter that it 
is as it were distant from it as heaven is from earth. But that the sense of the letter contains such things within itself, and that it is representative and significative of arcana that no one sees 
except the Lord, and angels from Him, is evident from what has been stated in various places in the first Part of this work. The sense of the letter bears a relation to the internal sense like that of 
the human body to the soul. While a man is in the body, and thinks from bodily things, he knows almost nothing about the soul; for the functions of the body are different from those of the soul, so 
different that if the functions of the soul were disclosed, they would not be acknowledged as such. The case is the same with the internals of the Word: its soul, that is, its life, is in its internals, 
and these have regard solely to the Lord, His kingdom, the church, and to those things in man that belong to His kingdom and church; and when these are regarded, it is the Word of the Lord, for in 
this case there is life itself therein. That this is really the case has been confirmed by many things in the first Part, and has been given me to know as a certainty; for no ideas concerning bodily and 
worldly things can by any possibility pass to the angels, but they are put off and altogether removed at the first threshold, as they leave man; as may be seen in the first Part, from experience itself 
(n. 1769-1772 inclusive), and also how they are changed (n. 1872-1876).  [2] This may also be sufficiently evident from very many things in the Word that are not at all intelligible in the sense 
of the letter, and that would not be acknowledged as the Word of the Lord if there were not such a soul and life in them; nor would they appear as Divine to anyone who has not been imbued from infancy 
with the belief that the Word is inspired and thereby holy. Who would know from the sense of the letter what those things signify which Jacob spoke to his sons just before his death (Gen. 49): </p>
<p>    
 That Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an adder upon the path, biting the horse's heels, and his rider shall fall backward (verse 17); that a troop shall ravage Gad, and he shall ravage the heel (verse 
19); that Naphtali is a hind let loose, giving discourses of elegance (verse 21); that Judah shall bind his young ass to the vine, and the son of his she-ass to the noble vine; he shall wash his 
garment in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes; his eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk (Gen. 49:11-12); </p>
<p>and the case is the same with very many passages in the Prophets. 
But what these things signify cannot possibly appear except in the internal sense, in which all things both in general and in particular are coherent in the most beauty order.  [3] The case is 
the same again with all that the Lord said concerning the last times: </p>
<p>     In the consummation of the age, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall 
from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man, and then shall all the tribes of the earth wail (Matt. 24:29-30). These words by no means 
signify the darkening of the sun and moon, nor the falling of the stars from heaven, nor the wailing of the tribes; but they signify charity and faith, for in the internal sense these are "the sun and 
the moon," and these will be darkened; and they also signify the knowledges of good and truth, for these are "the stars," which are here called "the powers of the heavens," and which will thus fall 
down and vanish; and that so also will all things of faith, which are "the tribes of the earth." This was shown also in Part First (n. 31, 32, 1053, 1529-1531, 1808). From these few things the nature 
of the internal sense of the Word may be seen, and also that it is remote, and in some places very remote, from the sense of the letter. But still the sense of the letter represents truths; and sets 
forth appearances of truth, in which a man can be when not in the light of truth.            GENESIS 17      1. And Abram was a son of ninety years and nine years; and Jehovah appeared to Abram, and 
said unto him, I am God Shaddai; walk thou before Me, and be thou perfect.      2. And I will give My covenant between Me and thee, and will multiply thee very exceedingly.      3. And Abram fell 
upon his faces; and God spoke with him saying: </p>
<p>     4. I, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be for a father of a multitude of nations.      5. And thy name shall no more be called Abram; 
and thy name shall be Abraham, for a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.      6. And I will make thee fruitful very exceedingly, and I will make thee nations, and kings shall go forth 
from thee.      7. And I will set up My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee, unto their generations, for an eternal covenant, to be to thee for God, and to thy seed after thee.  
    8. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be to them for God.      9. And God said 
unto Abraham, And thou shalt keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, unto their generations.      10. This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee, that 
every male be circumcised unto you.      11. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and you.      12. And a son of eight days shall 
be circumcised unto you, every male in your generations, he that is born in the house, and he that is bought with silver from every son that is a stranger, who is not of thy seed.      13. Circumcising 
he shall be circumcised that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy silver; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an eternal covenant.      14. And the uncircumcised male, who 
is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his peoples, he hath made vain My covenant.      15. And God said unto Abraham, Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her 
name Sarai, for Sarah is her name.      16. And I will bless her, and will also give thee a son from her; and I will bless her, and she shall be for nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.   
   17. And Abraham fell upon his faces, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall there be born to a son of a hundred years? And shall Sarah, that is a daughter of ninety years, bear?      18. And Abraham 
said unto God, Would that Ishmael might live before Thee!      19. And God said, Truly Sarah, thy wife, shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will set up My covenant 
with him for an eternal covenant, to his seed after him.      20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold I will bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him very exceedingly; twelve 
princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.      21. And My covenant will I set up with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the following year.      22. 
And He left off speaking with him; and God went up from over Abraham.      23. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver, every male 
among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God spoke with him.      24. And Abraham was a son of ninety and nine years, when he was circumcised 
in the flesh of his foreskin.      25. And Ishmael his son was a son of thirteen years, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.      26. In the self-same day was Abraham circumcised, 
and Ishmael his son.      27. And all the men of his house, he that was born in the house, and he that was bought with silver from the stranger, were circumcised with him. </p>

Few can believe that within the Word there is an internal sense which does not show itself at all in the letter. They cannot do so because it is as remote from the sense of the letter as so to speak 
heaven from earth. But it is clear from what has been stated in various places in Volume One that the sense of the letter contains such things within itself, and represents and means arcana which nobody 
sees except the Lord and the angels, who see them from Him. The relationship of the sense of the letter to the internal sense is like that of man's body to his soul. While a person is in the body and 
thinks from bodily things he knows hardly anything of the soul, for the body's functions are different from those of the soul, so different that if the soul's functions were disclosed they would not 
be acknowledged as such. It is similar with the inward part of the Word. Present there is its soul, that is, its life; and that inward part has no regard to anything except the Lord, His Kingdom, the 
Church, and those things with man which belong to His Kingdom and Church. And when the regard is to these it is the Word of the Lord, for in that case they have life itself within them. That this is 
how it is with the Word has been confirmed extensively in Volume One, and is something which I have been allowed to have definite knowledge of. For no ideas concerning bodily and worldly things can possibly 
come across to angels, but are cast aside and totally removed at the threshold while leaving man, as may be seen from experience itself presented in Volume One, <a href="1769.htm">1769</a>-<a href="1772.htm">1772</a> inclusive; and how they 
are altered, in <a href="1872.htm">1872</a>-<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is also quite clear from very many statements in the Word which are by no means intelligible in the sense of the letter, and which, if they did not possess 
that soul or life within them, would not be acknowledged to be the Word of the Lord. Nor would they be seen to be Divine to anyone who has not been trained from infancy to believe that the Word is inspired 
and so is holy. Who from the sense of the letter would know of the meaning of those statements in Genesis <a href="49.htm">49</a> which Jacob made to his sons before he died? </p>
<p>Dan will be a serpent on the road, an 
asp on the path, biting the horse's heels, and its rider will fall backwards. Verse 17. </p>
<p>A troop will plunder Gad, and he will plunder the heel. Verse 19. </p>
<p>Naphtali is a hind let loose, giving beautiful 
words. Verse 21. </p>
<p>Judah will bind to the vine his ass's foal and to the choice vine his she-ass's colt. He will wash his garment in wine and his clothing in the blood of grapes. His eyes will 
be redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk. Verses 11, 12. </p>
<p>Very many places in the Prophets contain similar statements. But what these words mean is not at all evident except in the internal 
sense in which every single detail links together in a very lovely order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What the Lord declared in Matthew about the last times is similar, </p>
<blockquote>
At the close of the age the sun will be darkened, 
and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear, and then all the tribes 
of the earth will mourn. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words do not mean at all the darkening of the sun and the moon, or the falling of the stars from the sky, or the mourning of tribes. Instead they mean 
that charity and faith - sun and moon in the internal sense - are going to be darkened in this fashion. They mean that the cognitions of good and truth - 'the stars' which are here called 'the powers 
of the heavens' - are going to fall away and disappear. And they mean all things of faith, which are 'the tribes of the earth', as has also been shown in Volume One, in <a href="31.htm">31</a>, <a href="32.htm">32</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>,<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>. </p>
<p>These 
few observations now show what the internal sense of the Word is and also that it is remote, in some places very remote, from the sense of the letter. Yet be that as it may, the sense of the 
letter represents truths, and also sets forth appearances of truth for a person to see by when he does not see by the light of truth. </p>

GENESEOS 				CAPUT DECIMUM SEPTIMUM </p>
<p>Pauci possunt credere quod in Verbo sit sensus internus qui prorsus non elucet ex littera, et hoc quia tam remotus est a sensu litterae, ut {1} quasi 
distet sicut caelum a terra; sed quod sensus litterae in {2} se talia contineat, et quod sit repraesentativus et significativus arcanorum quae nemo videt quam Dominus et angeli a Domino, constat ab illis 
quae in Parte Prima passim dicta sunt: se habet sensus litterae ad sensum internum sicut hominis corpus ad ejus animam; homo dum in corpore est et ex corporeis cogitat, paene nescit aliquid de anima, 
nam corporis functiones aliae sunt quam animae, adeo ut si functiones animae detegerentur, non agnoscerentur quod tales; ita se habet quoque cum internis Verbi; in internis ejus est anima, hoc est, 
vita illius; haec, nempe interna, nihil aliud spectant quam Dominum, Ipsius Regnum, Ecclesiam, et illa quae Ipsius Regni et Ecclesiae sunt apud hominem; quae cum spectantur, est Verbum Domini, nam tunc 
est ipsa vita in illis; quod ita se habeat, multis confirmatum est in Parte Prima; et pro certo scire datum {3}; nusquam enim aliquae ideae de corporeis et mundanis transire possunt ad angelos, sed 
exuuntur illae et prorsus removentur in primo limine cum abeunt ab homine, ut {4} ab ipsa experientia videri potest in Parte Prima, n. 1769-1772 incl.; et quomodo mutantur n. 1872-1876: [2] Hoc quoque 
satis constare potest ex perplurimis in Verbo, quae nusquam intelligibilia sunt in sensu litterae, quae nisi illis anima seu vita talis inesset, non agnoscerentur pro Verbo Domini, nec ulli qui non 
ab infantia imbuit quod crederet Verbum esse inspiratum et sic sanctum, apparerent ut Divina.  Quis ex sensu litterae sciret quod significant illa quae Jacobus locutus ad filios suos ante mortem, Gen. 
xlix? 	Quod Dan serpens super via, aspis super semita, mordens calcaneos equi, et cadet eques ejus retrorsum, vers. 17.  Quod Gadem turma depraedabitur [eum,] ille depraedabitur calcaneum, vers. 19. 
Quod Naphtali [sit] cerva dimissa, dans sermones elegantiae, vers. 21.  Quod Jehudah ligabit ad vitem asininum pullum suum, et ad vitem nobilem filium asinae suae: lavabit in vino vestimentum suum, 
et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum: ruber oculis prae vino, et albus dentibus {5} prae lacte, vers. 11, 12. Similiter in perplurimis locis apud Prophetas; at quid haec significant, nusquam patet nisi 
in {6} sensu interno, in quo omnia et singula pulcherrimo ordine cohaerent.  [3] Similiter quae Dominus dixit de ultimis temporibus apud Matthaeum, 	In consummatione saeculi, sol obscurabitur, et luna 
non dabit lucem suam; et stellae cadent de caelo, et virtutes caelorum commovebuntur; et tunc apparebit signum Filii hominis; et tunc plangent omnes tribus terrae, xxiv 29, 30; </p>
<p>haec nusquam significant 
obscurationem solis et lunae, nec delapsum stellarum de caelo, nec planctum tribuum, sed charitatem et fidem, quae in sensu interno sunt `sol' et `luna', et [ita] obscurabuntur; tum {7} cognitiones 
boni et veri, quae sunt `stellae', et hic vocantur `virtutes caelorum' quae ita decident et evanescent; et quod omnia fidei, quae sunt `tribus terrae' ut quoque ostensum est in Parte Prima n. 31, 
32, 1053, 1529-1531, 1808.  Ex his paucis nunc constare potest quid sensus internus Verbi, tum quod remotus et aliquibus in locis remotissimus sit a sensu litterae: sed usque sensus litterae repraesentat

Et erigam foedus Meum inter Me et inter te, et inter semen tuum post te in generationes illorum, in foedus aeternum, ad esse tibi in DEUM, et semini tuo post te. 	8.  Et dabo tibi, et semini tuo post 
te, terram peregrinationum tuarum, omnem terram Canaan, in possessionem aeternam, et ero illis in DEUM. 	9.  Et dixit DEUS ad Abraham, Et tu foedus Meum custodies, tu et semen tuum post te, in generationes 
eorum. 	10.  Hoc foedus Meum quod custodietis inter Me et inter vos, et inter semen tuum post te, circumcidi vobis omnem masculum. 	11.  Et circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri, et erit in 
signum foederis inter Me et inter vos. 	12.  Et filius octo dierum circumcidetur vobis, omnis masculus, in generationes vestras, natus domus, et emptio argenti, ab omni filio alienigena, qui non e semine 
tuo ille. 	13.  Circumcidendo circumcidetur natus domus tuae, et emptio argenti tui, et erit foedus Meum in carne vestra in foedus aeternum. 	14.  Et praeputiatus masculus, qui non circumciditur 
carne praeputii sui, et excidetur anima illa ex populis suis, foedus Meum irritum fecit. 	15.  Et dixit DEUS ad Abraham, Sarai uxor tua non vocabis nomine ejus Sarai, quoniam Sarah nomen illius. 	16. 
 Et benedicam (c)illi, et etiam dabo ex illa tibi filium; et benedicam (c)illi, et erit in gentes, reges populorum ex illa erunt. 	17.  Et cecidit Abraham super facies suas, et risit, et dixit in 
corde suo, Num filio centum annorum nascetur? et an Sarah filia nonaginta annorum pariet? 	18.  Et dixit Abraham ad DEUM, Utinam Jishmael vivat coram Te. 	19.  Et dixit DEUS, Vere Sarah uxor tua pariens 
tibi filium, et vocabis nomen illius Jishak, et erigam foedus Meum cum illo in foedus aeternum semini illius post illum. 	20.  Et quoad Jishmaelem audivi te, ecce benedicam illi, et fructificari 
faciam illum, et multiplicari faciam illum in valde valde; duodecim principes gignet, et dabo illum in gentem magnam. 	21.  Et foedus Meum erigam cum Jishako, quem pariet tibi Sarah, ad statum tempus 
hoc in anno sequente. 	22.  Et absolvit ad loquendum cum illo, et ascendit DEUS desuper Abrahamo. 	23.  Et accepit Abraham Jishmaelem filium suum, et omnes natos domus suae, et omnem emptionem argenti 
sui, omnem masculum in viris domus Abrahami, et circumcidit carnem praeputii eorum in eodem die hoc, quemadmodum locutus cum illo DEUS. 	24.  Et Abraham filius nonaginta et novem annorum, in circumcidendo 
illo carnem praeputii sui. 	25.  Et Jishmael filius illius, filius tredecim annorum, in circumcidendo illi carnem praeputii ejus. 	26.  In eodem die hoc circumcisus est Abraham, et Jishmael 
filius ejus. 	27.  Et omnes viri domus ejus, natus domus, et emptio argenti, a filio alienigena, circumcisi sunt cum illo. </p>
