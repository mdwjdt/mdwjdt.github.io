<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2746节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2746.</strong>头顶上方有一个灵人活在肉身时生活放荡，喜欢变换口味。所以，他不会始终爱一个人，而是经常流连于妓院，因而与许多女人行淫，并且每一个都是与之媾合后就抛弃。因此，他哄骗了很多女人，并由此熄灭了对婚姻的渴望，甚至生孩子的渴望，从而获得一种变态性。所有这些事都被揭露出来，他受到悲惨地惩罚，天使们见证了这一切。后来，他被投入地狱。关于行淫者的地狱，可参看第一卷（<a href="824.htm">824</a>-<a href="830.htm">830</a>节）。</p>

There was a certain spirit in middle altitude above the head, who in the life of the body had lived wantonly, delighted with variety, so that he loved no one constantly, but passed his time in brothels, 
and thus had scortated with many, every one of whom he had afterwards rejected. It hence came to pass that he had beguiled many, and had thereby extinguished the desire for marriage, even for the 
procreation of children, and thus had contracted an unnatural nature. All these things were disclosed, and he was miserably punished, and this in the sight of the angels; and afterwards he was cast into 
hell. (Concerning the hells of adulterers, see volume 1, n. 824-830.) </p>

There was a certain spirit fairly high up overhead who during his lifetime had lived licentiously and had delighted in variety, so that he did not love one woman constantly but frequented brothels. Thus 
he had fornicated with many, each of whom he had rejected after going with her. It therefore came about that he had cheated many and that consequently he had annihilated the desire for marriage, and 
even the desire to beget children, and so had acquired an unnatural nature. All these things were disclosed, and then he suffered wretched punishment - these events being witnessed by the angels; and 
after that he was cast into hell. Concerning the hells of adulterers, see Volume One, in <a href="824.htm">824</a>-<a href="830.htm">830</a>. </p>

</p><b>2746.</b>
Erat quidam spiritus in media altitudine supra caput, qui in vita corporis lascive vixerat, delectatus varietate, sic ut nullam constanter amaverit, sed in lupinaribus, et sic scortatus cum multis, 
et rejecerit singulas postea, inde factum, quod plures defraudaverit, et quod inde exstinxerit desiderium pro conjugio, etiam pro infantum procreatione, et sic naturam innaturalem contraxerit: omnia illa 
detecta fuerunt, et is misere punitus, et hoc in conspectu angelorum; et dein in infernum conjectus.  De infernis adulterorum videatur in Parte Prima n. 824-830. </p>
