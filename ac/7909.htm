<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7909节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7909.</strong>“有酵的物，你们都不可吃”表要高度警惕、极其小心地防止把虚假变成自己的。这从“有酵的物”和“吃”的含义清楚可知：“有酵的物”是指虚假，如前所述（<a href="7906.htm">7906</a>节）；“吃”是指变成自己的，也如前所述（<a href="7907.htm">7907</a>节）。经上频繁提到不可吃发酵之物的禁令(如12:15，17-19），这些禁令暗示要对虚假高度警惕、极其小心。之所以要对虚假高度警惕、极其小心，是为了叫人能处于良善。虚假不同意良善，而是摧毁良善；因为虚假与邪恶结合，真理与良善结合。如果虚假变成人自己的，也就是说，人坚信虚假，就不会有对纯真之良善的接受，因而不会从诅咒中得以释放。将虚假变成自己的是一回事，只是抓住它是另一回事。那些抓住它的人若处于良善，那么当真理向他们显现时，他们就会弃绝它，把它抛到一边。但那些将虚假变成自己的人会紧抓不放，当真理显现时，他们会反对真理本身。这就是经上如此频繁地说不可吃有酵之物的原因。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7909</b></p><p><b>7909.</b>
Ye shall eat nothing leavened. That this signifies that every caution is to be used to prevent falsity from being appropriated, is evident from the signification of "that which is leavened," as being 
falsity (of which above n. 7906); and from the signification of "to eat," as being to appropriate to oneself (of which also above, n. 7907). The frequent prohibition against eating what is leavened-as 
at verses 15 to 19-involves that the utmost caution is to be used against falsity. This utmost caution against falsity is to be used in order that man may be in good. Falsity does not agree with good, 
but destroys good; for falsity is of evil, and truth is of good. If falsity is appropriated, that is, firmly believed, there is no reception of the good of innocence, consequently no liberation from 
damnation. It is one thing to appropriate falsity to oneself, and another to adjoin it. They who adjoin falsity, if they are in good, reject it when the truth appears to them; but they who appropriate 
falsity to themselves, retain it and resist the truth itself when it appears. This then is the reason why it is so often said that what is leavened must not be eaten. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7909</b></p><p><b>7909.</b>
'You shall eat nothing made with yeast' means being fully on their guard against making falsity their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'anything made with yeast' as falsity, dealt with above in <a href="7906.htm">7906</a>; and from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, also dealt with above, in <a href="7907.htm">7907</a>. The prohibition stated so frequently that what is made with yeast must not be eaten, as in verses 15,17-19, 
implies being fully on guard against falsity. The reason a person should be fully on his guard against falsity is in order that he may be governed by good. Falsity does not agree with good but destroys 
it, for falsity is wedded to evil, and truth is wedded to good. If falsity is made one's own, that is, if one firmly believes it, no reception of the good of innocence takes place, consequently no 
deliverance from damnation. It is one thing to make falsity one's own, another only to take hold of it. If governed by good, those who take hold of falsity cast it away when the truth appears to them. 
But those who make falsity their own hang on to it and stand opposed to the truth when it appears. This then is the reason for the prohibition stated so frequently that what is made with yeast must not 
be eaten. </p>

</p><b>7909.</b>
`Nullum fermentatum comedetis': quod significet quod cavendum omnino ne approprietur falsum, constat ex significatione `fermentati' quod sit falsum, de qua supra n. 7906; et ex significatione `comedere' 
quod sit appropriare sibi, de qua etiam supra n. 7907.  Quod tam frequenter dicatur quod `fermentatum non comedetur,' ut vers. 15, 17-19, involvit quod omnino cavendum sit a falso; causa quod a falso 
omnino cavendum, est ut homo in bono sit; falsum non concordat cum bono sed destruit bonum, nam falsum est mali et verum est boni; si falsum appropriatur, hoc est, firmiter creditur, {1} nulla est 
receptio boni innocentiae, consequenter non liberatio a damnatione.  Aliud est appropriare sibi falsum, aliud est adjungere {2}; qui adjungunt, si in bono sunt, falsum rejiciunt cum apparet illis verum; 
at qui appropriant sibi falsum retinent illud, ac ipsi vero cum apparet, resistunt; inde nunc est quod tam frequenter dicatur quod non comedetur fermentatum. 	@1 i tunc$ 	@2 i illud$ </p>
