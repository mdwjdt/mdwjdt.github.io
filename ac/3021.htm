<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3021节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3021.</strong>“请把手放在我大腿底下”表照它的能力使其对着婚姻之爱的良善承诺。这从“手”和“大腿”的含义清楚可知：“手”是指能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节）；“大腿”是指婚姻之爱的良善，如下文所述。它在其能力范围内承诺，这从以下事实明显看出来：按照古代习俗，凡在涉及婚姻之爱的事上承诺之人都要把手放在被承诺之人的大腿底下，以这种方式被这人置于誓言之下。之所以这样做，是因为“大腿”表婚姻之爱，“手”表能力，或竭尽所能。人体的所有部位都与天堂这个大人里面的属灵和属天之物相对应，如前所示（<a href="2996.htm">2996</a>，<a href="2998.htm">2998</a>节）。蒙主怜悯，这一点以后会有详述。大腿本身连同两腰与婚姻之爱相对应。这些事对绝大多数上古之人来说，是众所周知的。因此，他们的众多习俗或仪式就源于这种对应关系。其中包括，当指着婚姻之爱的良善承诺时，他们就把手放在大腿底下。这类事物的知识是古人最珍视的，也是构成他们的知识和聪明的主要事物之一。但如今，这类知识完全丧失了，并且丧失得如此彻底，以致连这种对应关系的存在都不为人知了。所以有些人才会惊讶于此处所描述的习俗或仪式竟然表示这类事物。经上之所以在此提及这个仪式或习俗，是因为所论述的主题是以撒与亚伯拉罕家族的某个人订婚，并且这项任务被委托给老仆人来执行。<br />如前所述，“大腿”因对应而表示婚姻之爱。这也可从圣言中的其它经文看出来，如从妇人被她丈夫指控行淫时所遵循的程序可以看出来。摩西书：<br />祭司要叫妇人发咒起誓；又要对那妇人说，耶和华叫你大腿消瘦，肚腹发胀时，愿耶和华使你在你民中成为咒诅和誓语。他叫她喝了那水以后，她若被玷污，得罪了丈夫，这致咒诅的水必进入她里面变苦了，她的肚腹就要发胀，大腿就要消瘦，那妇人便要在她民中成为咒诅。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.21.htm">5:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.27.htm">27</a>）<br />“大腿就要消瘦”表涉及婚姻之爱的邪恶，也就是行淫。这个程序中的其它每个细节都有某种具体含义，以至于没有一个最小细节不包含某种事物。然而，人若对圣言的神圣没有任何概念，那么在阅读圣言时就会感到奇怪，为何那里包含这类事物。正因“大腿”表婚姻之爱的良善，所以经上才经常提及“从大腿而出”，如经上论及雅各说：<br />你要繁殖增多，必有一个民族和一群民族从你而来，又有君王从你大腿而出。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.11.htm">35:11</a>）.<br /><br />那与雅各同到埃及的每个灵魂，凡从他大腿所出的。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.26.htm">46:26</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出1.5.htm">1:5</a>）<br />论到基甸：<br />基甸有七十个从他大腿所出的儿子。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士8.30.htm">8:30</a>）<br />“大腿”和“腰”因表属于婚姻之爱的事物，故也表属于爱与仁的事物，因为婚姻之爱是构成其它一切爱的基础（参看<a href="686.htm">686</a>，<a href="2733.htm">2733</a>，<a href="2737.htm">2737</a>-<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>节）。因为一切爱皆来自这一源头，即来自天上的婚姻，也就是善与真的婚姻（参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）。“大腿”表属天之爱的良善和属灵之爱的良善，这从以下经文明显看出来。启示录：<br />那骑白马的在祂的衣服和大腿上有名写着：万王之王，万主之主。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.16.htm">19:16</a>）<br />“那骑白马的”是指圣言，因而是指主，主就是圣言（参看<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。“衣服”表神圣真理（<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节）；因此，祂被称为“万王之王”（<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>节）。由此明显可知“大腿”表示什么，即表示从祂的爱所流出的神圣良善；祂由此也被称为“万主之主”（<a href="3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="3011.htm">3011</a>节）。由于这就是主的本质，故经上说祂“在衣服和大腿上有写着的名”，因为“名”表本质或性质（<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>节）。<br />诗篇：<br />大能者啊，愿你大腿边佩剑，带着你的荣耀和威严！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.3.htm">45:3</a>）<br />这论及主。“剑”表争战的真理（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>节）；“大腿”表爱之善；“大腿边佩剑”表祂用来作战的真理要来自爱之善。以赛亚书：<br />公义必当祂的腰带，真理必当祂大腿的带子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.5.htm">11:5</a>）<br />这也论及主。“公义”因论及爱之善（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节），故被称为“腰带”；而真理因来自良善，故被称为“大腿的带子”；因此，“腰”论及良善里面的爱，而“大腿”论及真理里面的爱。<br />同一先知书：<br />祂里面没有疲倦的，绊跌的；祂既不打盹，也不睡觉；祂大腿上的带子并不放松，鞋带也不折断。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.27.htm">5:27</a>）<br />这同样论及主。“祂大腿上的带子”和前面一样，表真理里面的爱。在耶利米书，耶和华吩咐先知去买一根麻布带子束腰，不可放在水中；又吩咐他往幼发拉底河去，将腰带藏在那里的磐石穴中；当他回去将腰带从那地方取出后，腰带已经坏了（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.7.htm">7</a>）。“麻布带子”表真理，用它“束腰”是代表真理来自良善。谁都能看出，这些行为都具有代表性；然而，它们的含义若不通过对应，就无法得知。对此，蒙主怜悯，我将在某些章节末尾予以说明。<br />以西结、但以理和尼布甲尼撒所看到的那些事物的含义也一样。如以西结书：<br />在基路伯头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，仿佛蓝宝石的形状；在宝座形像以上有仿佛人形状的样式在上头。我周围有仿佛烧煤的形状，有仿佛火的形状在它里面；从他腰及以上的形状，又从腰及以下的形状，我看见有仿佛火的形状，祂周围也有光辉；下雨的日子，云中虹的形状怎样，周围光辉的形状也是怎样。这就是耶和华荣耀的样式的形状。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">1:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.28.htm">28</a>）<br />显然，这场景就是主及其国度的代表。“腰及以上的形状”和“腰及以下的形状”描述了祂的爱，这从“火”、“光辉”和“彩虹”的含义明显可知：“火”是指爱（<a href="934.htm">934</a>节）；“光辉”和“彩虹”是指来自那爱的智慧和聪明（<a href="1042.htm">1042</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>节）。<br />关于但以理，经上说：<br />有一人身穿细麻衣，腰束乌法精金带。他身体如水苍玉，面貌如闪电的形状，眼目如火把，手臂和脚如光明的铜那么闪耀。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.5.htm">10:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.6.htm">6</a>）<br />若不通过代表和它们的对应关系，谁都也不明白这些细节，即“腰”、“身体”、“面貌”、“眼目”、“手臂和脚”表示什么。从这些代表和对应明显可知主的天国就体现在但以理所看到的事物中，其中“腰”是指圣爱，腰上所束的“乌法精金带”是指由来自爱的智慧所产生的良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）。<br />关于尼布甲尼撒所看到的大像，我们在但以理书读到：<br />这像的头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和大腿是铜的，脚是半铁半泥的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.32.htm">2:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.33.htm">33</a>）<br />这像代表教会的连续状态。“金头”代表第一个状态，该状态是属天的，因为它是对主之爱的状态；“银胸膛和膀臂”代表第二个状态，该状态是属灵的，因为它是对邻之仁的状态；“铜肚腹和大腿”代表第三个状态，该状态是属世良善的状态，因为“铜”表属世良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。属世之善也属于对邻之爱或仁，只是比起属灵之善，它存在于更低的层面上。“半铁半泥的脚”是指第四个状态，也就是属世真理的状态，因为“铁”表属世真理（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="426.htm">426</a>节），它也指与良善毫无结合的状态，这就是“泥”所表示的。由所有这一切可以看出，“大腿”和“腰”表示什么，即主要表示婚姻之爱，并由此爱表示一切真爱。这从上述经文，以及其它经文（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.25.htm">32:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.32.htm">32</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛20.2.htm">20:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛20.4.htm">4</a>；那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿2.1.htm">2:1</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.23.htm">69:23</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.11.htm">12:11</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.35.htm">12:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.36.htm">36</a>）明显看出来。在反面意义上，大腿和腰表与婚姻之爱并一切真爱相反的爱，也就是对自我和这个世界的爱，即我欲和物欲（参看列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上2.5.htm">2:5</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.10.htm">32:10</a>，<a

Put I pray thy hand under my thigh. That this signifies pledging it according to its power to the good of conjugial love, is evident from the signification of "hand," as being power (see n. 878); and 
from the signification of "thigh," as being the good of conjugial love, concerning which in what follows. That it is pledging to the extent of its power, is evident from the fact that they who were pledged 
to anything that related to conjugial love, by an ancient rite placed the hand under the thigh of him to whom they were being pledged, and in this manner they were put under oath by him; and this 
for the reason that the "thigh" signified conjugial love, and the "hand" power, or so far as was possible; for all the parts of the human body correspond to spiritual and celestial things in the Grand 
Man which is heaven, as was shown above (n. 2996, 2998); and as will be shown more fully, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. The thighs themselves together with the loins, correspond to conjugial 
love.  These things were well known to the men of the most ancient times; and therefore they had a number of rites based on this correspondence, of which one was that they placed the hands under the 
thigh when they were pledged to any good of conjugial love. The knowledge of such things, which was in highest esteem among the ancients, and was one of the chief things of their knowledge and intelligence, 
is at this day wholly lost; so completely that it is not even known that there is any correspondence; and some may therefore wonder that such things are signified by the rite here described. 
The rite is mentioned in the present case because the betrothing of Isaac to some one of the family of Abraham is treated of, and the discharge of the duty was intrusted to the elder servant. [2] That 
as before said the "thigh" from correspondence signifies conjugial love, may also be seen from other passages in the Word; as from the process enjoined when a woman was accused by her husband of adultery. 
In Moses: </p>
<p>     The priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing; and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath in the midst of thy people, when 
Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell. And when he hath given her the water to drink, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and hath trespassed a trespass against 
her husband, that the waters that are accursed shall enter into her and become bitterness, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman shall be a curse among her people 
(Num. 5:21, 27). That the "thigh should fall away," signified evil relating to conjugial love, that is, it signified adultery. The other particulars mentioned in the same process signify each of them 
some special thing belonging to the subject, so that there is not the least thing that does not involve something, however surprising this may seem to a man who reads the Word without any idea of its 
sanctity. Because of the signification of the "thigh" as being the good of conjugial love, mention is sometimes made of "coming forth from the thigh"-as is said of Jacob: </p>
<p>     Be fruitful and multiply; 
a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come forth from thy thighs (Gen. 35:11). And in another place: </p>
<p>     Every soul that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came forth 
from his thigh (Gen. 46:26; Exod. 1:5). And of Gideon: </p>
<p>     Gideon had seventy sons that came forth from his thigh (Judges 8:30). [3] And as the "thighs" and the "loins" signify the things belonging 
to conjugial love, they also signify the things of love and charity, for the reason that conjugial love is the fundamental love of all loves (see n. 686, 2733, 2737-2739); for all loves are from the 
same origin, that is, from the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth (see n. 2727-2759). That the "thigh" signifies the good of celestial love and the good of spiritual love, is evident 
from the following passages. In John: </p>
<p>     He that sat on the white horse had upon His vesture and upon His thigh a name written: King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). That He who sat on 
the white horse is the Word, thus the Lord who is the Word, may be seen above (n. 2760-2762); also that "vesture" is the Divine truth (n. 2576); therefore He is called "King of kings" (n. 3009). Hence 
it is plain what the "thigh" is, namely, the Divine good which is of His love; from which He is also called "Lord of lords" (n. 3004-3011). And because this is the Lord's quality, it is said that He 
"had thereon a name written;" for "name" signifies quality (n. 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006).  [4] In David: </p>
<p>     Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O Mighty One, in Thy glory and honor (Ps. 45:3); </p>
<p>speaking 
of the Lord; where "sword" denotes truth combating (n. 2799); and "thigh" the good of love; to "gird the sword upon the thigh" signifies that the truth from which He would fight would be from the good 
of love. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His thighs (Isa. 11:5); </p>
<p>speaking here too of the Lord; and because "righteousness" is predicated of 
the good of love (n. 2235), it is called the girdle of the loins;" and because truth is from good, it is called the "girdle of the thighs;" thus "loins" are predicated of the love of good, and "thighs" 
of the love of truth.  [5] In the same: </p>
<p>     None shall be weary nor stumble in Him, He shall not slumber nor sleep, neither is the girdle of His thighs loosed, nor the latchet of His shoes broken 
off (Isa. 5:27). This again is said of the Lord, and the "girdle of His thighs" denotes the love of truth, as before. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Jeremiah that he should buy a linen girdle 
and put it on his loins, but should not pass it through water; and that he should go to the Euphrates and hide it in a hole of the rock; and having done this, when he went and took it from the place, 
it was marred (Jer. 13:1-6). The "linen girdle" denotes truth, and "putting it on the loins" was a representative that truth was from good. Everyone can see that these are representatives, and their 
signification cannot be known except from correspondences, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy something will be said at the end of certain chapters. [6] So too with the signification of the 
things seen by Ezekiel, by Daniel, and by Nebuchadnezzar. As in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; 
and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the appearance of a burning coal, as the appearance of fire within it round about; from 
the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about Him; as the appearance of the bow 
that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about, so was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah (Ezek. 1:26-28).  That this was representative 
of the Lord and of His kingdom is evident; and that the appearance of the loins upward and the appearance of the loins downward has reference to His love, is evident from the signification of "fire," 
as being love (n. 934); and from the signification of "brightness" and a "rainbow" as being the derivative wisdom and intelligence (n. 1042, 1043, 1053).   [7] Concerning Daniel it is said: </p>
<p> 
    A man appeared to him clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz; his body also was like the tharshish stone, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps 
of fire, and his arms and feet like the shining of burnished brass (Dan. 10:5-6). What is signified by these particulars-by "loins," "body," "face," "eyes," "arms," and "feet"-can appear to no one 
except from representations and their correspondences. From these it is evident that the Lord's celestial kingdom is thus represented, in which the "loins" are Divine love; and the "gold of Uphaz" with 
which these were girded, is the good of wisdom which is from love (n. 113, 1551, 1552).      [8] Concerning what was seen by Nebuchadnezzar we read in Daniel: </p>
<p>     The head of the statue was good 
gold; its breast and its arms were silver; its belly and thighs were brass; the feet were part iron and part clay (Dan. 2:32-33). By that statue were represented the successive states of the church; 
by the "head which was gold," the first state, which was celestial, because it was a state of love to the Lord; by the "breast and arms which were silver," the second state, which was spiritual, as 
it was a state of charity toward the neighbor; by the "belly and thighs which were brass," the third state, which was a state of natural good (for this is "brass," n. 425, 1551). Natural good is of love 
or charity toward the neighbor in a degree below spiritual good. By the "feet which were iron and clay" is meant the fourth state, which was one of natural truth (which is "iron," n. 425, 426); and 
also of no coherence with good (which is "clay"). From all these things it may be seen what is signified by the "thighs" and the "loins," namely, in the chief place conjugial love, and from this all 
genuine love, as is evident from the passages quoted, and likewise from others (Gen. 32:25, 32; Isa. 20:2-4; Nahum 2:1; Ps. 69:23; Exod. 12:11; Luke 12:35, 36). In the opposite sense also are signified 
the opposite loves, which are the loves of self and of the world (see 1 Kings 2:5; Isa. 32:10, 11; Jer. 30:6; 48:37; Ezek. 29:7; Amos 8:10). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3021</b></p><p><b>3021.</b>
'Put now your hand under my thigh' means being bound, as regards its power, to the good of conjugial love. This is clear from the meaning of 'the hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, and from the meaning 
of 'the thigh' as the good of conjugial love, dealt with in what follows. A binding of this good to that power is indeed the meaning, as is clear from the consideration that those who were bound by 
an obligation to carry out some matter connected with conjugial love put their hand, according to ancient custom, under the thigh of the one to whom they were so bound, and in so doing swore by him. 
This was done because 'the thigh' meant conjugial love, and 'the hand' power, or the full extent of whatever one's capability might be. For all parts of the human body correspond to spiritual and celestial 
things in the Grand Man, which is heaven, as shown in <a href="2996.htm">2996</a>, <a href="2998.htm">2998</a>, and will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown more extensively later on. The thighs themselves, together with the loins, correspond 
to conjugial love. Those things were well known to the most ancient people, and for that reason so many customs came down from them, including that of putting their hands under the thigh when being 
bound by an obligation to carry out something connected with the good of conjugial love. Their knowledge of such things, which was valued most highly by the ancients, and belonged among the chief things 
that constituted their knowledge and intelligence, is totally lost today, so much so that not even the existence of any such correspondence is known, and for this reason people will probably be astounded 
that such things are meant by that custom. Here, because the subject is the betrothal of Isaac his son to another member of Abraham's family, and the oldest servant was called on to perform that 
task, this custom was therefore followed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It has been stated that 'the thigh', because of its correspondence, means conjugial love, and this may also be seen from other places in the Word, for 
example, from the procedure to be followed when a woman was accused by her husband of adultery, in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
The priest shall make the woman take the oath of a curse, and the priest shall say to the 
woman, Jehovah will make you a curse and an oath in the midst of your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh fall away and your belly swell. When he has made her drink the water, then it will happen, 
if she has defiled herself and committed a trespass against her husband, that the water causing the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her belly will swell, and her thigh will fall away; 
and the woman will be a curse in the midst of her people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%205:21,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 5:21, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The falling away of the thigh' means the evil of conjugial love, which is adultery. Every other detail in the same procedure 
had some specific meaning, so that not even the smallest detail fails to embody something, though anyone reading the Word who has no concept of its sacredness will wonder why such things are included 
there. It is because 'the thigh' means the good of conjugial love that the expression 'those coming out of the thigh' is used frequently, as in a reference to Jacob, </p>
<blockquote>
Be fruitful and multiply; a 
nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will go out from your thighs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same author, </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since 'the thigh' and 'the loins' mean the things that belong to 
conjugial love they also mean those that belong to love and charity, the reason being that conjugial love underlies every other kind of love, see <a href="686.htm">686</a>, <a href="2733.htm">2733</a>, <a href="2737.htm">2737</a>-<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>. These all have the same source 
- the heavenly marriage - which is a marriage of good and truth, regarding which see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>. For 'the thigh' means the good of celestial love and the good of spiritual love, as may be seen from the 
following places: In John, </p>
<blockquote>
He who sat on the white horse had on His robe and on His thigh the name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'He who sat on the white horse' is the 
Word, and so the Lord, who is the Word, see <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. 'Robe' means Divine Truth, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, and for that reason He is called 'King of kings', <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>. From this it is evident what 'the thigh' means, namely the 
Divine Good which flows from His love, on account of which He is also named 'Lord of lords', <a href="3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="3011.htm">3011</a>. And this being the Lord's essential nature, it is said that He had a name written on His robe 
and on His thigh, for 'name' means essential nature, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Gird Your sword on Your thigh, O Mighty One, in Your glory and honour! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2045:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 45:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the 
Lord. 'Sword' stands for truth engaged in conflict, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, 'thigh' for the good of love. 'Girding the sword on the thigh' means that the truth which He was to use in the fight was allied to the good of 
love. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Righteousness will be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His thighs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to the Lord. Because 'righteousness' has reference to the good that 
flows from love, <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>, it is called 'the girdle of His loins', while 'truth' because it comes from good, is called 'the girdle of His thighs'. Thus 'loins' is used in reference to the love within good, 
and 'thighs' to the love within truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet' </p>
<blockquote>
None will be weary, and none will stumble in Him. He will not slumber nor sleep. Nor has the girdle of His thighs been loosed, 
nor the thong of His shoes torn away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. 'The girdle of His thighs' stands, as above, for the love within truth. In Jeremiah Jehovah told the prophet to buy a linen 
girdle and put it over his loins but not dip it in water. He was then told to go away to the Euphrates and hide it in a cleft of the rock. When he went back at a later time to retrieve it from that 
place it was spoiled, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2013:1-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 13:1-7</a>. 'A linen girdle' stands for truth, but the placing of it over his loins was representative of the fact that truth was the outward </p>
<p>expression of good. Anyone may see 
that these actions are representative. Their meaning however cannot be known except from correspondences, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with at the ends of certain chapters further 
on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 It is similar with the meaning of the things seen by Ezekiel, Daniel, and Nebuchadnezzar: Ezekiel saw, </p>
<blockquote>
Above the firmament that was above the heads of the cherubim, in appearance like a 
sapphire stone, there was the likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of a throne, there was a likeness, as the appearance of a Man (Homo) upon it above. And I saw as it were the shape of fiery 
coals, as the shape of fire, within it round about. From the appearance of His loins and upwards, and from the appearance of His loins and downwards, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, whose brightness 
was round about it like the appearance of the rainbow which is in the cloud on the day of rain; so was the appearance of the brightness round about, thus was the appearance of the likeness of 
the Glory of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:26-28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This scene was clearly representative of the Lord and His kingdom. 'The appearance of His loins upwards and the appearance, of His loins downwards' is descriptive 
of His love, as is evident from the meaning of 'fire' as love, <a href="934.htm">934</a>, and from the meaning of 'brightness' and of 'the rainbow' as wisdom and intelligence from that love, <a href="1042.htm">1042</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Daniel 
saw, </p>
<blockquote>
A man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz, and whose body was like tarshish,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and whose face was like the appearance of lightning and whose eyes were like fiery torches, 
and whose arms and feet were like the shine of burnished bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2010:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 10:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What each of these expressions means - the loins, the body, the face, the eyes, the arms, and the feet - does not 
become clear to anyone except from representations and correspondences involved in these. From these it is evident that in what Daniel saw the Lord's heavenly kingdom was represented, in which Divine 
Love constitutes the loins, and 'the gold of Uphaz' with which He was girded, the good resulting from wisdom that is grounded in love, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Daniel: Nebuchadnezzar saw a statue 
whose head was fine gold, breast and arms silver, belly and thighs bronze, feet partly iron, partly clay, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:32,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:32, 33</a>. This statue represented consecutive states of the Church. The head of gold represented 
the first state, which was celestial because it was a state of love to the Lord; the breast and arms of silver represented the second state, which was spiritual because it was a state of charity 
towards the neighbour; the belly and thighs of bronze represented the third state, which was a state of natural good meant by 'bronze', <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a> - natural good being love or charity towards the neighbour 
as this exists on a lower level than spiritual good - while the feet of iron and clay were the fourth state, which was a state of natural truth meant by 'iron', <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>, and also a state involving 
complete lack of cohesion with good, which is meant by 'clay'. </p>
<blockquote>
From all this one may see what is meant by the thighs and loins, namely conjugial love primarily, and from this love every genuine 
kind of love, as is evident from the places quoted and also from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2032:25,%2031,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 32:25, 31, 32</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2020:2-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 20:2-4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum%202:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Nahum 2:1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:35,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:35, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
The thighs and loins also mean in the contrary sense 
those loves that are the reverse of conjugial love and all genuine loves, namely self-love and love of the world, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 2:5, <a href="6.htm">6</a>; Isa. 32:10, <a href="11.htm">11</a>; Jer. 30:6; 48:37; Ezek. 29:7; Amos 8:10.

`Pone quaeso manum tuam sub femore meo': quod significet obstrictionem ejus quoad potentiam ad bonum amoris conjugialis, constat a significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878; et a significatione 
`femoris' quod sit bonum amoris conjugialis, de qua sequitur: quod sit obstrictio ad illam potentiam, constat ex eo quod qui obstringerentur ad aliquod quod esset amoris conjugialis, ab antiquo 
ritu posuerint manum sub femore illius cui obstringebantur, et sic adjurati sint ab illo, et hoc ex causa quia `femur' significabat amorem conjugialem, et `manus' potentiam seu quantum posset; omnes 
enim partes corporis humani correspondent spiritualibus et caelestibus in Maximo Homine, qui est caelum, ut n. 2996, 2998 ostensum; et amplius in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ostendetur; 
{1}ipsa femora cum lumbis correspondent amori conjugiali; haec antiquissimis fuerunt nota, quare ritus plures illis inde haerunt, inter quos etiam quod ponerent manus sub femore, cum ad quoddam bonum 
amoris conjugialis obstringerentur; cognitio talium, quae antiquis fuit aestimatissima et inter praecipua scientiae et intelligentiae illorum, hodie prorsus deperdita est, usque adeo ut ne quidem 
sciatur quod sit aliqua correspondentia, et forte inde miraturi quod talia per illum ritum significentur: hic quia agitur de {2}desponsatione {3}Jishaki filii cum aliqua ex familia Abrahami, et servo 
seniori dictum ut {4}officio illo fungeretur, ideo {5}hic ritus.  [2] Quod `femur' significet amorem conjugialem, ex correspondentia, ut dictum, etiam ab aliis locis in Verbo constare potest, ut ex processu 
mandato cum mulier accusaretur adulterii a viro suo, apud Mosen,           Adjurabit sacerdos mulierem juramento {6}maledictionis,      et dicet sacerdos mulieri, Dabit Jehovah temet in    
  {6}maledictionem et in adjurationem in medio populi tui, in      dando Jehovah femur tuum cadens, et ventrem tuum      tumentem....Cum bibendas dederit ei aquas, et fiet, si      polluta et praevaricata 
praevaricationem in virum suum, et      venient in (x)illam aquae maledictae in amaritudines, et      tumescet venter ejus, et cadet femur ejus, et erit mulier in      {6}obsecrationem in medio 
populi sui, Num. v 21, 27; </p>
<p>quod `femur caderet' significabat malum amoris conjugialis seu adulterium; cetera quae in eodem processu, quoad singula, specialia rei significabant, sic ut ne minimum 
sit quod non involvit aliquod, utcumque homo qui absque sancti idea legit Verbum, miraturus cur talia.  Ex significatione `femoris' quod sit bonum amoris conjugialis, aliquoties dicitur quod `egressi 
femur ejus,' ut de Jacobo,           (m)Fructificare et multiplicare, gens et coetus gentium      erit ex te, et reges ex feminibus tuis exibunt, Gen. xxxv 11: </p>
<p>et alibi,(n)           Omnis anima 
veniens Jacobo ad Aegyptum, egressi femur       ejus, Gen. xlvi 26; Exod. i 5: </p>
<p>et de Gideone,           Gideoni erant septuaginta filii, egressi femur ejus,       Jud. viii 30. [3] Et quia `femora, 
femina et lumbi' significant illa quae sunt amoris conjugialis, etiam significant illa quae sunt amoris et charitatis, ex causa quia amor conjugialis est fundamentalis omnis amoris, videatur n. 686, 
2733, 2737-2739, ex eadem enim origine sunt, nempe ex conjugio caelesti quod est boni et veri, de quibus videantur n. 2727-2759; quod `femur' significet bonum amoris caelestis, et bonum amoris spiritualis, 
constare potest ab his locis, apud Johannem,           Sedens super equo albo, habebat super vestimento suo, et super femore suo, nomen scriptum, Rex regum, et Dominus dominorum, [Apoc.] xix 
16; </p>
<p>`sedens super equo albo' quod sit Verbum, ita Dominus Qui Verbum, videatur n. 2760-2762; quod `vestimentum' sit Divinum Verum, n. 2576, {7}ideo dicitur `Rex regum,' n. {8}3009; inde patet quid 
`femur,' quod nempe Divinum Bonum quod est amoris Ipsius, ex quo etiam vocatur `Dominus dominorum,' n. {8}3004-3011, hoc quia est quali Domini, dicitur quod `haberet super illis nomen scriptum,' `nomen 
enim significat quale, n. 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006: [4] apud Davidem,           Accinge gladium tuum super femur, potens gloria tua et      honore, Ps. xlv 4 [A.V. 3]; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino; `gladius' pro 
vero pugnante, n. 2799, `femur' pro bono amoris; `accingere gladium super femur' est quod verum ex quo pugnaret, esset ex bono amoris: apud Esaiam,           Erit justitia cingulum lumborum Ipsius, et 
veritas       cingulum feminum Ipsius, xi 5; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de Domino; `justitia quia praedicatur de bono amoris n. 2235, vocatur `cingulum lumborum'; `veritas' {9}quia ex bono, dicitur `cingulum feminum'; 
ita `lumbi' praedicantur de amore boni, et `femina' de amore veri: [5] apud eundem,           Non fessus, et non impingens in Ipso, non dormitabit,       et non indormiet, et non solutum est cingulum 
feminum Ipsius,      et non avulsa corrigia calceorum Ipsius, v 27; </p>
<p>de Domino, `cingulum feminum' pro amore veri, ut supra: apud Jeremiam,           Jehovah ad illum, quod emeret cingulum lini, 
et poneret      super lumbos, sed per aquam non duceret;...et abiret a      Euphratem, et absconderet illud in foramine petrae;...quo      facto, cum abiit, et recepit illud e loco,...corruptum 
erat      xiii 1-7; </p>
<p>`cingulum lini' pro vero, {10}repraesentativum quod verum esset ex bono, erat quod `poneret illud super lumbos'; quisque videre potest quod haec repraesentativa sint, quae non sciri 
possunt quid significant nisi ex correspondentiis, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordi ad finem {11}quorundam capitum; [6] similiter quid significant illa quae visa Ezechieli, Danieli, et Nebuchadnezzari; 
Ezechieli,           Supra expansum, quod supra caput cheruborum,      quasi aspectus lapidis sapphiri, similitudo throni; et super      similitudine throni similitudo sicut aspectus 
Hominis super      illo superius; et vidi sicut speciem prunae, sicut aspectum      ignis intra {12}illam circumcirca; ab aspectu lumborum Ipsius      et sursum, et ab aspectu lumborum Ipsius et deorsum, 
vidi       quasi aspectum ignis, et splendorem illi circumcirca sicut      aspectum iridis, quae est in nube in dic pluviae, ita aspectus      splendoris circumcirca, ita aspectus similitudinis 
gloriae      Jehovae, i 26-28;   quod hoc repraesentativum fuerit Domini, ac regni Ipsius, constare potest, et quod `aspectus lumborum sursum et aspectus lumborum deorsum' sit Ipsius amoris, patet 
a significatione `ignis' quod sit amor, n. 934, et a {13}splendoris et iridis quod sit inde sapientia et intelligentia, n. 1042, 1043, 1053: [7] Danieli,           Vir visus illi indutus linteis, 
et lumbi ejus cincti auro      Uphasi, et corpus ejus sicut Tarshish, et facies ejus sicut      aspectus fulguris, et oculi ejus sicut lampades ignis, et      brachia ejus et pedes ejus sicut splendor 
aeris laevigati, x      [5], 6;                             quid singula haec, nemini constare potest nisi ex repraesentationibus et illarum correspondentiis, ut quid lumbi, quid corpus, quid facies,

<p>per statuam illam status Ecclesiae successivi repraesentati sunt, per `caput quod aurum' primus status, qui fuit caelestis quia amoris in Dominum; per `pectus et brachia quae argentum' 
secundus {14}status, qui fuit spiritualis quia charitatis erga proximum; per `ventrem et femora quae aes' tertius status, qui fuit boni naturalis quod est `aes,' n. 425, 1551, bonum naturale est amoris 
seu charitatis erga proximum in gradu infra bonum spirituale; per `pedes qui ferrum et argilla' quartus status, qui fuit veri naturalis quod est `ferrum,' n. 425, 426, et quoque nullius cohaerentiae 
cum bono, quod est `argilla.'  Ex his constare potest quid per femora et lumbos significatur, {15}quod nempe amor conjugialis principaliter, et inde omnis amor genuinus, ut ex adductis locis patet, 
et quoque ex, Gen. xxxii 26, 32, 33 [A.V. 25, 31, 32]; Esai. xx 2-4; Nahum ii 2 [A.V. 1]; Ps. lxix 24 [A.V. 23]; Exod. xii 11; Luc. xii 35, 36; etiam in opposito sensu {16}amores illis contrarii, nempe
