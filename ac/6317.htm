<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6317节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6317.</strong>曾有一些灵人与我同在，他们活在世上时被视为有学问的人。他们被带回处于肉身时的思维状态；那时，他们的思维，尤其关于灵的思维传给了我。其思维具有这样的性质：他们永远不可能被引导相信一个灵人享有任何感觉；他们对于灵，或死后灵魂的一切想法都缺乏任何实际的品质。这是因为他们认为生命在于身体，并利用知识和哲学来坚决反对灵的生命，或死后灵魂；由此关闭了自己心智的内层部分，以至于他们决无可能被提升至这些内层部分。以后他们若坚决反对属于死后生命的观念，若被告知绝对真理，就会像看不见的瞎子、听不见的聋子那样对待它们；其中有些人还会讥笑它们，并且越自以为比别人更智慧，就越是如此行。但那些处于信之良善、没有学问的人却不像他们，因为他们没有利用知识或哲学来坚决反对教会事物；因此，他们享有更广泛、更清晰的觉知。他们没有关闭自己心智的内层部分，所以能接受良善与真理。</p>

There were spirits with me who when they had lived in the world were called learned. They were let into the state of thought in which they had been when in the body, and their thought about spirits was 
communicated to me, which thought was of such a nature that they could never be brought to believe that a spirit enjoys any sensation; and everything else they had thought about spirits or souls after 
death was devoid of all quality. The reason was that they had made life consist in the body, and by means of matters of knowledge and of philosophy had confirmed themselves against the life of the 
spirit or soul after death; and thereby had closed interior things against themselves in such a manner that they could not possibly be elevated into them. After they had confirmed themselves against 
the things that belong to the life after death, if the veriest truths had then been told them, they would have treated them like the blind who see not, and like the deaf who hear not; and some of them 
would ridicule them; and this in exact proportion to their belief in their own preeminent wisdom. But the unlearned, who have been in the good of faith, are not of this character, for they have not confirmed 
themselves against the things of the church by means of any matters of knowledge and philosophy, and therefore their perception is broader and clearer; and because they have not closed interior 
things they are capable of receiving goods and truths. </p>

Once there were present with me some spirits who had been called learned when they had been people living in the world. They were taken back to their state of thought when they had been in the body; 
and what they had thought then was communicated to me, in particular their thought about spirits. The nature of their thought was such that they could never have been led to believe that a spirit was 
endowed with any sensory power; and all else they had thought about spirits or souls after death was devoid of any real quality. The reason for this was that they had considered the body to be the place 
where life resides and by the use of factual evidence and philosophical arguments had set themselves firmly against any idea that their spirit or soul would have life after death. As a consequence 
they had closed the interior parts of their minds, to which they then could not possibly have been raised. If, after they had set themselves against ideas about what belongs to life after death, they 
had then been told absolute truths, they would in their response to those truths have been like blind people with no sight and deaf ones with no hearing. Some of those people are also scornful, increasingly 
so the more they think they are wiser than others. But uneducated people who have been governed by the good of faith are not like them, for they have not used factual evidence or philosophical 
arguments to set themselves firmly against things of the Church, and on account of that they enjoy broader and clearer perception. And because they have not closed the interior parts of their minds they 
have the ability to accept what is good and true. </p>

Fuerunt apud me spiritus qui cum vixerunt homines in mundo, eruditi dicti sunt; et {1} remittebantur in statum cogitationis in quo fuerunt cum in corpore, et communicata est mihi cogitatio eorum, et 
quidem de spiritibus; quae cogitatio erat talis ut nusquam potuerint adduci {2}ad credendum quod spiritus aliquo sensu gaudeat; et cetera quae de spiritibus seu animabus post mortem cogitaverant, erant 
absque omni quali; causa fuit quia vitam {3} posuerunt in corpore, et contra vitam spiritus seu animae suae post mortem confirmaverunt se per scientifica et philosophica; inde {4}clauserant sibi interiora, 
in quae sic elevari nequicquam potuerunt; postquam se confirmaverunt contra illa quae sunt vitae post mortem, {5}si dein verissima illis dicta {6}essent, fuissent ad illa sicut caeci qui non 
vident, et sicut surdi qui non audiunt; quidam eorum etiam irrident, et hoc eo plus quo se credunt aliis sapientiores esse.  Indocti autem qui in bono fidei fuerunt, non sunt tales, nam hi per nulla scientifica 
ac philosophica confirmaverunt se contra illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, quapropter perceptio eorum extensior est et clarior {7}; et quia non clauserunt interiora, in facultate sunt recipiendi (t)bona 
et vera.   @1 i tunc$ @2 credere$ @3 i solum$ @4 clauserunt$ @5 postea si$ @6 fuissent$ @7 i est$ </p>
