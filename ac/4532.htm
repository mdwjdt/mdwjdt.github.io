<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4532节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4532.</strong>那些以为他们凭自己理解良善与真理，由此唯独信靠自己，因而自以为比所有人都更有智慧，尽管事实上他们根本不知道何为良善与真理的人，尤其那些不想理解何为良善与真理，因而陷入虚假的人，在来世有时被带入一种黑暗状态；当陷入这种状态时，他们说话就像白痴，因为他们处于愚蠢的状态。我被告知，像这样的人有很多，其中就包括那些自以为居于最大光明，还向其他人如此显现之人。</p>

They who believe that they understand good and truth of themselves, and hence trust in themselves alone, and thus deem themselves wiser than all (although they are in ignorance of what is good and true), 
and especially those who do not desire to understand what is good and true, and consequently are in falsities, in the other life are sometimes let into a state of darkness; and when they are in it, 
they speak idiotically, for they are in stupidity. I have been told that there are many such, and among them those who had believed themselves to be set in the greatest light, and had also appeared 
so to others. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4532</b></p><p><b>4532.</b>
There are those who believe that the source of their understanding of what is good and true resides within themselves, and who as a consequence trust solely in themselves, thus imagining that they are 
wiser than all others. These - though in fact they do not have any knowledge of what is good and true, especially those who do not wish to have an understanding of what is good and true and are therefore 
governed by falsities - are sometimes consigned in the next life to a state of darkness. While they are in that state what they say is foolish since they dwell in a state of stupidity. I have been 
told that there are many like these, included among them those who had believed themselves to be dwelling in the greatest light and had also seemed to others to do so. </p>

</p><b>4532.</b>
Qui credunt se ex semet intelligere bonum et verum, ac inde sibi solis fidunt, ac sic se sapientiores omnibus putant, cum tamen in ignorantia `boni et veri' sunt, praecipue qui non intelligere `bonum 
et verum' volunt, ac inde in falsis sunt, in altera vita quandoque mittuntur in statum tenebrarum, in quo cum sunt, loquuntur fatue, sunt enim in stupiditate; dictum mihi quod plures tales sint, 
et inter eos, qui crediderunt se in maxima luce constitutos, et quoque tales apparuerunt aliis. </p>
