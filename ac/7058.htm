<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7058节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7058.</strong>“摩西将耶和华所说的一切话都告诉了亚伦”表直接从主的神性发出的真理进入间接发出的真理的流注，以及在教义细节上的教导。这从“告诉”和“耶和华所说的一切话”的含义，以及“摩西”和“亚伦”的代表清楚可知：“告诉”是指流注（参看<a href="5966.htm">5966</a>节）；“摩西”是指直接从主的神性发出的真理（参看<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7054.htm">7054</a>节）；“亚伦”是指间接从主的神性发出的真理（参看<a href="7009.htm">7009</a>节）；“耶和华所说的一切话”是指教义的细节。“摩西将这些话告诉亚伦”之所以表示教导，是因为来自神性的教导通过流注实现，这流注由“告诉”来表示。由此明显可知，“摩西将耶和华所说的一切话都告诉了亚伦”表示直接从主的神性发出的真理进入间接发出的真理的流注，以及在教义细节上的教导。<br />至于在教义细节上的教导，当直接从主的神性发出的真理与间接发出的真理结合时，这种教导就被赐下；因为这时，觉知被赐下，如前所述（<a href="7055.htm">7055</a>节）。这两种真理尤其在被称为属天的至内层或第三层天堂的天使中间结合。这些天使对这两种真理有一种敏锐的觉知，并由于这种觉知而对主的同在有一种清晰的感觉。原因在于，比起其他人，他们更处于良善，因为他们拥有纯真的良善。因此，他们离主最近，被极其明亮，可以说燃烧的火光包围；他们看见主如同日头，祂放射的光线就有这种表象，因为他们离主最近。<br />当主在世，并向祂的父呼求，就好像父与祂自己分离时，就说“直接从主的神性发出的真理”，尽管此处在内义上所论述的主题是主。此中情形如何，这在前面已有多次阐述，即：神性本身或耶和华在祂里面；因为祂是从耶和华成孕的；因此，祂也称祂为祂的“父”，称祂自己为祂的“子”。但那时，主在通过遗传从母亲那里所继承来的软弱人身中；并且祂处于这人身到何等程度，在祂里面的耶和华或神性本身就看似不存在到何等程度；而主在得了荣耀或变成神性的人身中到何等程度，耶和华或神性本身就存在，并且就在这人身本身里面到何等程度。由此可知要如何理解“直接从神性发出的真理来自主的神性”这句话。</p>

And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah. That this signifies the influx of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord into the truth which proceeds mediately, and instruction 
in the details of doctrine, is evident from the signification of "telling," as being influx (see n. 5966); from the representation of Moses, as being the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of 
the Lord (see n. 7010, 7054); from the representation of Aaron, as being the truth proceeding mediately from the Divine of the Lord (see n. 7009); and from the signification of "all the words of Jehovah," 
as being the details of doctrine. Instruction is signified by "Moses told the words to Aaron," for instruction from the Divine is effected by means of influx, which influx is signified by "telling." 
From all this it is evident that by "Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah" is signified the influx of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord into the truth which proceeds 
mediately, and instruction in the details of doctrine. [2] There is instruction in the details of doctrine, when the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord is conjoined with the 
truth which proceeds mediately, for then there is perception (of which above, n. 7055). There is this conjunction especially among the angels who are in the third or inmost heaven, and are called celestial. 
These angels have an exquisite perception of the truth of both kinds, and from this of the Lord's presence. The reason is that they are in good more than others, for they have the good of innocence; 
consequently they are nearest to the Lord, and in an intensely bright and as it were flaming light, for they see the Lord as a sun, the rays of whose light are such from the nearness. [3] It is 
said truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord, although in the internal sense the subject here treated of is the Lord when He was in the world, and when He called upon His Father as 
separate from Himself. But how the case herein is, has been occasionally told before, namely, that the Divine Itself, or Jehovah, was in Him, for He was conceived of Jehovah; and therefore He also calls 
Him His "Father," and Himself His "Son." But the Lord was then in the human that was infirm by heredity from the mother, and insofar as He was in this, so far Jehovah or the Divine Itself which was 
in Him appeared to be absent; but insofar as the Lord was in the Human glorified, or made Divine, so far Jehovah or the Divine Itself was present, and in the very Human. From this then it can be known 
how it is to be understood that the truth which had proceeded immediately from the Divine was from the Divine of the Lord. </p>

'And Moses told Aaron all Jehovah's words' means an influx of truth going forth directly from the Lord's Divine into truth that goes forth in an indirect way, and instruction in specific doctrinal teachings. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'telling' as influx, dealt with in <a href="5966.htm">5966</a>; from the representation of 'Moses' as truth going forth directly from the Lord's Divine, dealt with in <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7054.htm">7054</a>; from 
the representation of 'Aaron' as truth that goes forth in an indirect way from the Lord's Divine, dealt with in <a href="7009.htm">7009</a>; and from the meaning of 'all Jehovah's words' as specific doctrinal teachings. 
Instruction is meant by 'Moses told Aaron' those things, because instruction from the Divine is effected by means of influx, meant by 'telling'. From all this it is evident that 'Moses told all Jehovah's 
words' means an influx of truth going forth directly from the Lord's Divine into truth that goes forth in an indirect way, and instruction in specific doctrinal teachings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards instruction 
in specific doctrinal teachings, it is imparted when truth going forth directly from the Lord's Divine is joined to truth that goes forth in an indirect way; for then perception is imparted, see 
above in <a href="7055.htm">7055</a>. The two kinds of truth are joined together especially  among the angels who are in the third or inmost heaven, those who are called celestial. They have a keen perception of both, and 
from that a clear feeling of the Lord's presence. The reason for this is that they more than others are governed by good, for in them the good of innocence is present. As a consequence they are nearest 
the Lord, surrounded by flashing and so to speak burning light, for they see the Lord as the Sun, whose radiating light has that appearance because they are so near Him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The expression 'truth 
going forth directly from the Lord's Divine' is used even though the subject here in the internal sense is the Lord when He was in the world and called upon His Father as if He were separate from Himself. 
But the situation then, as stated a number of times already, was that the Divine itself or Jehovah was within Him; for He had been conceived from Jehovah, whom for that reason He also called His 
Father, while calling Himself His Son. But at that time the weak Human inherited from His mother had come to the forefront in the Lord; and to the extent that it did so, Jehovah or the Divine itself 
which was within Him seemed to be absent, whereas to the extent that the Human that had been glorified or made Divine had come to the forefront in the Lord, Jehovah or the Divine itself was present, 
there in the Human itself. From this one may now know how to understand the idea that truth which had gone forth directly from the Divine came from the Lord's Divine.  </p>

`Et indicavit Moscheh Aharoni omnia verba Jehovae': quod significet influxum veri immediate procedentis a Divino Domini in verum quod mediate procedit, et instructionem in singulis doctrinae, constat 
ex significatione `indicare' quod sit influxus, de qua n. 5966; ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum immediate procedens a Divino Domini, de qua n. 7010, 7054; ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' 
quod sit verum {1}mediate procedens a Divino Domini, de qua n. 7009; et ex significatione `omnium verborum Jehovae' quod sint {2}singula doctrinae; instructio significatur per quod `Moscheh {3}indicavit 
illa Aharoni,' fit enim instructio a Divino per influxum, qui significatur per `indicare'; ex his patet quod per `indicavit Moscheh Aharoni omnia verba Jehovae' significetur influxus veri immediate 
procedentis a Divino Domini in verum quod mediate procedit, et instructio in singulis doctrinae. 	2 Quod instructionem in singulis doctrinae attinet, datur illa cum verum immediate procedens a Divino 
Domini conjungitur cum vero quod mediate procedit, nam tunc datur perceptio, videatur supra n. 7055; (s)conjunctio illa datur imprimis apud angelos qui in tertio seu intimo caelo sunt, ac caelestes 
vocantur; illi habent exquisitam perceptionem {4} utriusque veri, et inde praesentiae Domini; causa est quia in bono sunt {5}prae aliis, nam illis bonum innocentiae est; idcirco {6} Domino proximi sunt 
ac in luce fulgurante et quasi flammante, nam Dominum vident ut Solem cujus (t)lucis radii tales sunt ex propinquitate.(s) 	3 Verum immediate procedens a Divino Domini dicitur, tametsi agitur hic 
in sensu interno de Domino cum fuit in mundo, et cum invocavit Patrem Suum sicut a {7}Se separatum; sed quomodo hoc se {8}habet, prius aliquoties dictum est, quod nempe Ipsum Divinum seu Jehovah fuit 
in Ipso, nam a Jehovah conceptus est, quare etiam Ipsum vocat Patrem Suum, (c)et Semet Filium Ipsius; sed {9}Dominus tunc fuit in Humano infirmo ex hereditario a matre, et quantum in hoc fuit, tantum 
Jehovah seu Ipsum Divinum, quod fuit in Ipso, apparuit absens, at quantum Dominus fuit in Humano glorificato seu Divino facto, tantum Jehovah seu Ipsum Divinum praesens fuit ac in Ipso Humano; inde nunc 
sciri potest quomodo intelligitur per quod dicatur quod verum quod immediate processerat ex Divino fuerit ex Divino Domini. 	@1 quod mediate procedit$ 	@2 vera$ 	@3 indicaret omnia verba Jehovae$ 	@4
