<p><strong>[NCE]1716.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1716/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_16" target=_top>Genesis 14:16</a>. And he brought back all the property; and Lot his brother and his property he also brought back, and also the women and the people.<br />He brought back all the property means that the intermediate self restored everything in the outer self to its appropriate condition. And Lot his brother and his property he also brought back means the outer self and everything in it. The women and the people symbolize both the good impulses and the true ideas. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1716</b></p><p><b>1716.</b>
Verse 16. And he brought back all the substance, and also brought back his brother Lot and his substance, and the women also, and the people. "He brought back all the substance," signifies that the interior 
man reduced all things in the external man into a conforming state; "and also brought back his brother Lot and his substance," signifies the external man and all the things belonging to it; "the 
women and the people," signifies both the goods and the truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1716</b></p><p><b>1716.</b>
Verse 16 And he brought back all the acquisitions, and also Lot his brother and his acquisitions he brought back, and the women and the people as well. </p>
<p>'He brought back all the acquisitions' means 
that the Interior Man brought all things in the External Man back into a state of agreement. 'And also Lot his brother and his acquisitions he brought back' means the External Man and all that belonged 
to it. 'The women and the people' means both goods and truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1716</b>
</p><b>1716.</b>
Vers. 16.  Et reduxit omnem acquisitionem; et etiam Lotum fratrem suum, et acquisitionem ejus, reduxit, et etiam mulieres et populum. 'Reduxit omnem acquisitionem' significat quod Interior Homo redegit 
omnia quae in Externo Homine in statum convenientem 'et etiam Lotum fratrem suum, et acquisitionem ejus reduxit' significat Externum Hominem et omnia quae illius: 'mulieres et populum' significat 
tam bona quam vera. </p>
