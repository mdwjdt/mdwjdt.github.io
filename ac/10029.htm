<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10029节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10029</strong>.“要把一切脂肪”表适合的良善。这从“脂肪”或“脂油”的含义清楚可知，“脂肪”或“脂油”是指良善（参看<a href="5943.htm">5943</a>节）。之所以说适合的良善，是因为此处所论述的主题是外在人或属世人的洁净，真理与良善的植入，因而这二者在那里的结合；因为这些事就是祭牲和燔祭所表示的。因此，“小公牛的脂肪”在此表示适合属世人或外在人，能那里的真理结合的良善。事实上，真理必须适合它的良善，良善也必须适合它的真理；原因是，它们必须作为一体而存在。还要知道，属世人或外在人中的真理和良善不同于内在人中的真理和良善，正如外在事物不同于内在事物，或低处的事物不同于高处的事物，或也可说，在后的事物不同于在先的事物那样。属世人中的真理是记忆知识，那里的良善是伴随的快乐。这二者在人活在世上时就能被他感知到，因为当他思想它们时，它们立刻就会显现。然而，内在人中的真理不是立刻显现的记忆知识，而是被植入内在人的理解力部分的真理。也被植入内在人的良善是感知不到的，因为它被植入了内在人的意愿部分。这二者都属于此人的内在生命，在人的内在生命中，真理是信之真理，良善是爱之良善。这就是内在人或属灵人中的真理和良善，与外在人或属世人中的真理和良善之间的区别。外在人中的真理和良善的植入和结合由小公牛的祭牲来表示，但内在人中的这二者的植入和结合由下文所描述的公绵羊的燔祭来表示。由此明显可知“小公牛的脂肪”所表示的“适合的良善”是什么意思。</p>

And thou shall take all the fat. That this signifies good accommodated, is evident from the signification of "fat" or "fatness," as being good (see n. 5943). It is called "good accommodated," because 
the subject here treated of is the purification of the external or natural man, and the implantation of truth and good, and thus the conjunction of both there, for these are the things signified by the 
sacrifices and the burnt-offerings. Therefore by "the fat of the bullock" is here meant good accommodated to the natural or external man, and which can be conjoined with the truth there; for truth 
must be accommodated to its good, and good to its truth, because they must be a one. Be it also known that the truth and good in the natural or external man differ from the truth and good in the internal 
man, as do what is exterior and what is interior, or what is lower and what is higher, or what is the same, what is posterior and what is prior. The truth in the natural is memory-knowledge, and the 
good there is the delight of this, both of which are perceptible to man while he is in the world, for when they are thought of they are seen. But the truth in the internal man is not memory-knowledge 
that is seen, but is truth implanted in its intellectual part; and the good there also is not perceptible, because it is implanted in the will part-both in the man's interior life, in which truth is 
of faith, and good is of love. Such is the difference between the truth and good in the internal or spiritual man, and the truth and good in the external or natural man. The implantation and conjunction 
of the latter is signified by the sacrifice from the bullock, but the implantation and conjunction of the former, by the burnt-offering from the ram (of which below in this chapter). From all this 
it is evident what is meant by "accommodated good," which is signified by "the fat from the bullock." </p>

'And you shall take all the fat' means the accommodated good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the fat' as good, dealt with in <a href="5943.htm">5943</a>. The good is described as being accommodated because the subject 
here is the purifying of the external or natural man, also the implanting of truth and good and so the joining together of the two there; for these things are what are meant by sacrifices and burnt offerings. 
Here therefore the fat from the young bull serves to mean good which has been accommodated to the natural or external man and is able to be joined to the truth there. For truth must be accommodated 
to its good and good to its truth, the reason being that they must exist as one. It should also be remembered that truth and good in the natural or external man are different from truth and good 
in the internal man, just as outer and inner are different, or lower and higher, or - what amounts to the same thing - posterior and prior. Truth as it exists in the natural man is factual knowledge, 
and good as it exists there is the accompanying delight. Both of these are perceptible to a person while in the world, for when he gives thought to them they are immediately apparent. Truth in the internal 
man however is not like factual knowledge immediately making itself apparent; rather it is truth implanted in the understanding part of the internal man. The good too implanted in the internal 
man is not perceptible, for it is implanted in the will part there. Both belong to the person's inner life, in which the truth is the truth of faith and the good is the good of love. Such is the difference 
between the truth and good in the internal or spiritual man and the truth and good in the external or natural man. The implantation and joining together of the truth and good in the external man 
is meant by the sacrifice of the young bull, but the implantation and joining together of the two in the internal man is meant by the burnt offering of the ram, described further on in this chapter. 
From all this it is evident what should be understood by the accommodated good, meant by 'the fat' from the young bull.  </p>

`Et accipies omnem adipem': quod significet bonum accommodatum, constat ex significatione `adipis' seu pinguedinis, quod sit bonum, de qua n. 5943; bonum accommodatum dicitur, quia hic agitur de purificatione 
externi seu naturalis hominis, et de implantatione veri et boni, (c)ac sic de conjunctione utriusque ibi, nam ea sunt quae significantur per sacrificia et holocausta; ideo per adipem ex juvenco 
hic intelligitur bonum accommodatum naturali seu externo homini, et quod conjungi potest cum vero ibi, nam verum erit accommodatum suo bono ac bonum suo vero, ex causa quia unum erunt.  Sciendum 
etiam (o)est quod verum et bonum in naturali seu externo homine differat a vero et bono in interno {1} sicut exterius et interius, seu sicut inferius et superius, seu quod idem, sicut posterius et prius; 
verum in naturali {2} est scientificum, et bonum ibi est jucundum ejus, utrumque perceptibile homini dum in mundo (o)est, nam tunc cum cogitatur, apparet; ast verum in interno homine non est scientificum 
apparens, sed est verum implantatum intellectuali ejus parti; bonum etiam ibi non est perceptibile, quia est implantatum parti ejus voluntariae, utrumque interiori vitae hominis, in qua verum 
est fidei, et bonum est amoris; talis differentia est veri et boni in interno seu spirituali homine, ac veri et boni in externo seu naturali homine; horum implantatio et conjunctio significatur per sacrificium 
ex juvenco, illorum autem implantatio et conjunctio per holocaustum ex ariete, de quo in sequentibus hujus capitis.  Ex his {3} patet quid intelligitur per bonum accommodatum, quod significatur 
per adipem ex juvenco. @1 i homine,$ @2 i homine$ @3 inde$ </p>
