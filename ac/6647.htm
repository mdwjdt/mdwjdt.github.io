<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6647节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6647.</strong>“以色列人生养繁殖”表教会的真理在良善上增多。这从“以色列人”的代表，以及“生养”和“繁殖”的含义清楚可知：“以色列人”是指属灵真理（参看<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>节）和教会（<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）；“生养”是指在良善上增长（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>，<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="2847.htm">2847</a>，<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>节）；“繁殖”是指进一步的分支；一旦教会在一个人那里建立，良善就不断分支，既在内在里面分支，也朝外在，并在外在里面分支。前面经常说明，在属于属灵教会的人中间，良善通过真理增长；因为属灵教会成员不像属天教会成员那样拥有觉知，所以他若不通过真理，就不知道何为教会的良善，或属灵良善。正因如此，当属灵教会成员正在重生时，主会利用与那人同在的天使把真理带入他的意识，他通过这些真理被引向良善。但当这个人已经重生时，主会将真理和良善一起带入他的意识，以这种方式引导他。然而，对属灵教会成员来说，真理如何，良善就如何，因而良知也如何，该良知代替觉知而服务于他，他照着这良知生活。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6647</b></p><p><b>6647.</b>
And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and were productive. That this signifies that the truths of the church increased as to good, is evident from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being spiritual 
truths (see n. 5414, 5879), and the church (n. 6637); from the signification of "to be fruitful," as being to increase as to good (n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847, 3146); and from the signification 
of "to be productive," as being further derivation; for when the church has been set up anew with man, then good continually increases and is derived, both in the internal, and also toward and 
in the external. That with those of the spiritual church good increases by means of truths, has already been often shown; for the man of the spiritual church has not perception, as the man of the celestial 
church has, and therefore he does not know what the good of the church, or spiritual good, is, except by means of truths. Therefore when the man of the spiritual church is being regenerated, truths 
are stirred up by the Lord through the angels who are with him, and thereupon he is led into good. But when the man has been regenerated, then both truth and good together are stirred up, and in this 
way he is led. With the man of the spiritual church however, such as is the truth, such is the good, and hence such is the conscience, which is to him as perception, according to which he lives. </p>

'And the children of Israel were fruitful and productive' means that the Church's truths increased in goodness. This is clear from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as spiritual truths, 
dealt with in <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, and as the Church, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>; from the meaning of 'being fruitful' as increasing in goodness, dealt with in <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="2847.htm">2847</a>, <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>; and from the meaning of 'being productive' 
as further branching out; for once the Church has been established with a person, good increases constantly and branches out both within the internal and also towards the external, and within 
it. It has often been shown already that among those who belong to the spiritual Church good is increased by means of truths; for a member of the spiritual Church does not have perception as a member 
of the celestial Church has, and therefore he has no knowledge of what the Church's good - that is, spiritual good - is except through truths. This being so, when a member of that Church is being regenerated, 
the Lord uses the angels present with that person to bring truths to his awareness, and from those truths he is led on to good. But when that person has been regenerated, He brings both truth 
and good together to his awareness, and thereby leads him. But the character of the good with a member of the spiritual Church is determined by that of the truth, and so therefore is the character of 
his conscience, which serves him in place of perception, as a guide to the way he lives. </p>

`Et filii Israelis fructificabantur et producebantur': quod significet quod vera Ecclesiae crescerent quoad bonum, constat ex {1}repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint vera spiritualia, de qua 
n. 5414, 5879, et quod sint Ecclesia, n. 6637; ex significatione `fructificari' quod sit crescere quoad bonum, de qua n. 43, 55, 913 983, 2846, 2847, 3146; et ex significatione `produci' quod sit derivatio 
ulterior; cum enim Ecclesia apud hominem instaurata est, tunc bonum continue crescit et derivatur tam in interno quam quoque versus externum, et inibi.  Quod apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali 
sunt bonum crescat per vera, prius saepe ostensum est; nam homo Ecclesiae spiritualis non perceptionem habet, sicut homo Ecclesiae caelestis quare nec scit quid bonum Ecclesiae seu spirituale, nisi 
per vera; quapropter cum homo illius Ecclesiae regeneratur, vera excitantur a Domino per angelos qui apud illum, et inde in bonum ducitur cum autem ille homo regeneratus est, tunc simul et verum et 
bonum excitantur, et sic ducitur {2}; sed apud {3}hominem spiritualis Ecclesiae, tale est bonum quale est verum, et (t)inde talis conscientia, quae (t)ei est' sicut perceptio, secundum quam vivit. 	@1
