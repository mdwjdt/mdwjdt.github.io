<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1926节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1926．“耶和华的天使”在此是指从主的内在而来的内层思维。如前所述，这从整个思路清楚可知。“内层”在此表示主里面与耶和华，或祂的内在融合之物。这个融合不是立即、而是逐渐实现的，也就是说，从祂的童年早期直到祂在世生命的结束通过试探和胜利实现的。每一次试探和胜利都会产生融合，并且随着祂将自己与其内在，或耶和华融合，祂的思维日益变得内在，智性真理也日益与神性良善融合。这就是此处内层思维所指的思维，它来自主的内在，在此尤其适合由“耶和华的天使”来代表和表示。</p>

That in the passage before us "the Angel of Jehovah" denotes the interior thought that came from the Lord's Internal, is evident, as before said, from the connection. By that which is "interior" is here 
meant that in the Lord which was united to Jehovah, or to His Internal. The unition was not effected all at once and by a single alternation, but successively from His earliest childhood to the end 
of His life in the world, and this chiefly by means of temptations and victories. Each temptation and victory effected union, and in proportion as He united Himself with His Internal or Jehovah, in 
the same proportion His thought became interior, and in the same proportion intellectual truth was united to Divine good. This is the thought that is here meant by the interior thought which was from 
the Lord's Internal, and which is properly and peculiarly represented and signified in the present case by "the Angel of Jehovah." </p>

That 'the angel of Jehovah' here is the interior thought which came from the Lord's Internal is clear, as stated, from the train of thought. Here the term interior is used to mean that with the Lord 
which was united to Jehovah, or His Internal. Union was not accomplished all at once but step by step, that is to say, from earliest childhood through to the last stage of His life in the world, above 
all by means of temptations and victories. Each temptation and victory brought about union and to the extent He united Himself with His Internal or Jehovah, thought became more interior, and intellectual 
truth more united to Divine Good. It is the thought such as this that is meant by interior thought flowing from the Lord's Internal and that is specifically represented and meant here by 'the angel 
of Jehovah'. </p>

Quod angelus Jehovae hic sit interior cogitatio quae ab Interno Domini, constat, ut dictum, a serie. Per Interius intelligitur hic illud apud Dominum quod unitum fuit Jehovae seu Interno Ipsius: unitio 
non facta est simul et una vice sed successive, nempe a prima pueritia {1}ad ultimum Ipsius vitae in mundo; et hoc praecipue per tentationes et victorias; unaquaevis tentatio et victoria univit; etiam 
quantum se univit cum Interno seu Jehovah, tantum cogitatio interior facta, {2}et tantum intellectuale verum fuit unitum Divino Bono: haec cogitatio est quae intelligitur per interiorem cogitationem 
quae ab Interno Domini, et quae repraesentatur et significatur hic proprie per `angelum Jehovae.' @1 i usque$ @2 nam$ </p>
