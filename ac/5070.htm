<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5070节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5070.</strong>被赋予义人的永生是从良善流出的。良善拥有生命在自己里面，因为它来自主，而主是生命本身。来自主的生命里面就有智慧和聪明；因为智慧就在于从主接受良善，然后意愿良善；而聪明在于从主接受真理，然后相信真理。那些接受这种智慧和聪明的人就拥有生命；由于幸福与这种生命联结，所以这“生命”也表示永恒的幸福。那些陷入邪恶的人正好相反。诚然，他们看上去，尤其他们自己觉得似乎拥有生命；但这种生命在圣言中被称为“死亡”，实际上就是属灵的死亡；因为他们在任何良善上都没有智慧，在任何真理上都没有聪明。凡认真考虑这个问题的人都能看出这一点，由于良善及其真理含有生命在里面，故生命不可能存在于邪恶及其虚假里面，因为这些本质上是良善和真理的对立面，并且毁灭生命。因此，此处所讨论的人除了疯子所拥有的那种生命外，没有别的生命。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5070</b></p><p><b>5070.</b>
The "eternal life" which is given to the righteous, is life from good. Good has life in itself, because it is from the Lord, who is life itself. In the life which is from the Lord there are wisdom and 
intelligence; for to receive good from the Lord and thence to will good, is wisdom; and to receive truth from the Lord and thence to believe truth, is intelligence; and they who have this wisdom and 
intelligence have life; and as happiness is joined to such life, eternal happiness also is signified by "life." The contrary is the case with those who are in evil. These do indeed appear-especially 
to themselves-as if they had life, but it is such life as in the Word is called "death," and also is spiritual death; for they are not wise in any good, nor intelligent in any truth. This may be seen 
by everyone who takes the matter into consideration, for as there is life in good and in its truth, there cannot be life in evil and in its falsity, because these are opposite and extinguish life. Therefore 
the persons in question have no other life than such as belongs to the insane. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5070</b></p><p><b>5070.</b>
The eternal life which is imparted to the righteous is life flowing from good. Good has life within it because it comes from the Lord, who is life itself. Included within the life which comes from the 
Lord there is wisdom and intelligence; for wisdom consists in receiving good from the Lord and then making it the object of one's will, while intelligence consists in receiving truth from the Lord and 
then believing it. And those who receive such wisdom and intelligence have life. Also, because happiness is linked to that kind of life, eternal happiness too is meant by that life. The opposite is 
the case with those governed by evil. They do, it is true, seem - especially to themselves - to possess life; but it is the kind of life which in the Word is called death, and is in actual fact spiritual 
death; for they do not have any wise apprehension of what is good or any intelligent understanding of what is true. This may be seen by anyone who considers the matter carefully, for since it is 
good and the truth rooted in such good that hold life within them, no life can exist in evil or in the falsity springing from it, because these are by nature the reverse of good and truth and destructive 
of life. Consequently the people under consideration here have no other life than the kind which the insane have. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5070</b>
</p><b>5070.</b>
Vita aeterna quae justis, est vita ex bono; bonum in se vitam habet quia est a Domino, Qui est ipsa vita; vitae quae a Domino inest sapientia et intelligentia, nam bonum recipere a Domino et inde 
bonum velle, est sapientia, (c)ac verum recipere a Domino et inde verum credere, est intelligentia, et qui eam sapientiam et intelligentiam illi vitam habent; et quia felicitas tali vitae adjuncta 
est, est felicitas aeterna quae per {1}vitam quoque significatur. Contrarium est illis qui in malo sunt; hi apparent quidem, imprimis sibi, sicut vitam habeant, sed est talis vita quae in Verbo vocatur 
mors, et quoque est mors spiritualis, nam nihil boni sapiunt, nec veri intelligunt; {2}hoc constare potest unicuivis qui expendit, cum enim bono et inde vero inest vita, non potest vita esse 
malo et inde falso, nam haec contraria sunt et exstinguunt vitam, quapropter his non alia vita est quam qualis est insanis. @1 illam$ @2 A had (but d) haec vita vocata mors, quia ipsa vita quae est sapientiae 
et intelligentiae apud illos exstincta est, et manet vita qualis est insanis. For this A substitutes quia bono et inde vero inest vita, constare potest, quod non vita sit malo et inde falso, 
quia contraria sunt vitae.$ </p>
