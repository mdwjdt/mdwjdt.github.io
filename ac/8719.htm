<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8719节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8719.</strong>“把担子从你身上卸下来，让他们与你分担”表如此赋予他们职能和职责。这从“把担子从你身上卸下来”和“与你分担”的含义清楚可知：“把担子从你身上卸下来”是指也授权给其他人；“与你分担”是指协助。这些话之所以表示如此赋予他们职能和职责，是因为在主所行的一切事上，无论总体上还是具体地，祂都既直接从祂自己，也间接通过天堂而行。祂间接通过天堂而行，不是因为祂需要他们的帮助，乃是为了那里的天使能拥有职能和职责，从而拥有与其职责和功用一致的生活和幸福。对他们来说，由此便有了一种表象，即：他们凭自己行事；然而，他们发觉，他们所做的事，是从主来的。摩西“把担子从他身上卸下来”，并且夫长或首领们要审判小事，“与他分担”就表示这些事。主不仅直接流入，还间接流入，不仅流入秩序的最初层级，还流入中间和最末层级（参看<a href="6982.htm">6982</a>，<a href="6985.htm">6985</a>，<a href="6996.htm">6996</a>，<a href="7004.htm">7004</a>，<a href="7007.htm">7007</a>节）。</p>

And devolve from upon thee, and let them bear with thee. That this signifies thus functions and offices for them, is evident from the signification of "to devolve from upon thee," as being to hand down 
to others also; and from the signification of "bearing with thee," as being to be of assistance. That by these words is signified thus functions and offices for them, is because the Lord does each 
and all things from Himself immediately, and mediately through heaven. That He acts mediately through heaven is not because He needs their aid, but that the angels there may have functions and offices, 
and consequently life and happiness in accordance with their offices and uses. From this there is an appearance to them that they act from themselves, but a perception that it is from the Lord. These 
things are signified by Moses "devolving from upon him," and by the princes, who were to judge small matters, "bearing with him." (That the Lord flows in not only immediately, but also mediately, and 
not only into the firsts, but also into the mediates and lasts of order, see n. 6982, 6985, 6996, 7004, 7007.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8719</b></p><p><b>8719.</b>
'And roll down [the burden] from upon yourself, and let them bear [it] with you' means thus assigning them functions and duties. This is clear from the meaning of 'rolling down from upon yourself' as 
delegating also to others; and from the meaning of 'bearing with him' as being of assistance to. The reason why these words mean thus assigning them functions and duties is that in everything generally 
and specifically done by Him the Lord acts both directly from Himself and indirectly through heaven. He acts indirectly through heaven not because He needs their help but in order that the angels there 
may have functions and duties, and therefore life and happiness in keeping with the duties and services they perform. This accounts for the appearance to them that they act independently; yet they 
perceive that what they do comes from the Lord. These are the things which are meant by the advice that Moses should roll down [the burden] from upon himself, and that the rulers, who were to judge 
small matters, should bear [it] with him. Regarding the Lord's inflowing not only directly but also indirectly, not merely into the first levels of order but also into the middle and lowest levels, see <a href="6982.htm">6982</a>, <a href="6985.htm">6985</a>, <a href="6996.htm">6996</a>, <a href="7004.htm">7004</a>, <a href="7007.htm">7007</a>. </p>

</p><b>8719.</b>
`Et devolve desuper te, et portent tecum': quod significet sic functiones et officia pro illis, constat ex significatione `devolvere desuper te' quod sit derivare etiam ad alios, et ex significatione 
`portare cum illo' quod sit adjumento esse; quod per ea verba significetur quod sic functiones et officia pro illis, est quia Dominus omnia et singula agit, {1}ex Se immediate, et mediate per caelum; 
quod mediate per caelum agat, non est quod illorum opis (x)indigeat, sed ut angelis ibi sint functiones et officia, ac inde vita et secundum officia et usus felicitas; inde est quod sit apparentia illis 
quod ex se agant, sed perceptio quod ex Domino; {2}haec significantur per quod Moscheh devolveret desuper se, et principes, qui judicarent res parvas, portarent cum illo.  {3}Quod Dominus influat 
non solum immediate sed etiam mediate, nec modo in prima sed etiam in media et in ultima ordinis, videatur n. 6982, 6985, 6996, 7004, 7007. 	@1 et quod mediate per angelos in coelo, est ut illis sit$ 	@2 
hoc significatur$ 	@3 The remainder of the   in A stands at the end of n. 8718 but is marked for insertion here.$ </p>
