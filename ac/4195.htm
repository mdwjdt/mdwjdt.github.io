<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4195节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4195.</strong>“拉班称那石堆为伊迦尔撒哈杜他”表就“拉班”所代表的良善那一方而言，它的性质。这从“称”和“起名”的含义清楚可知，“称”和“起名”是指根本性质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）。在拉班所来自叙利亚的语言中，“伊迦尔撒哈杜他”表示“证据堆”（heap of witness）。在古时，这类堆是用作记号或证据，后来也用作敬拜。此处所提到的堆用作记号和证据；用作记号，是因为边界在那里；用作证据，是因为约是在那里立的，他们也不可越界害人；这一点从拉班的话明显看出来：<br />这石堆作证据，这柱子也作证据。我必不越过这石堆到你那里去；你也不可越过这石堆和柱子到我这里来害我。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.52.htm">31:52</a>）<br />由此可见“伊迦尔撒哈杜他”或“证据堆”是什么意思。但就内义而言，它表示就拉班那一方，即那些处于行为良善的人，也就是外邦人那一方而言，由真理所确认的良善的性质。</p>

And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha. That this signifies its quality on the part of the good represented by Laban, is evident from the signification of "calling," and of "calling by name," as being the 
quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 2009, 2724, 3421). In the idiom of Syria whence Laban came, "Jegar-sahadutha" means "the heap of witness." In ancient times such heaps were for a sign, or for a witness, 
and afterwards were also for worship; here, for a sign and for a witness; for a sign, that the boundary was there; and for a witness, that a covenant was made there, and that neither of them should 
pass it to do evil to the other; as is evident also from Laban's words: </p>
<p>     This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass 
over this heap to me, and this pillar, for evil (Gen. 31:52). From this it is manifest what "Jegar-sahadutha" (or "the heap of witness") involves. But in the internal sense it signifies the quality 
of good from truths on the part of Laban, that is, on the part of those who are in the goods of works, that is, on the part of the Gentiles. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4195</b></p><p><b>4195.</b>
'Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha' means the nature of it on the part of the good represented by 'Laban'. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling' and 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt 
with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>. 'Jegar Sahadutha' means 'heap of the testimony' in the language of Syria, where Laban came from. Such heaps in ancient times stood as a sign or else as a 
witness, and later on played a part in worship too. The heap referred to here stood as a sign and as a witness - as a sign that the boundary came there, and as a witness that the covenant had been made 
there and that neither of them would pass beyond that boundary to do harm to the other, as is also clear from Laban's words in verse 52, </p>
<p>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that 
I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and that you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. </p>
<p>From this one may see what the name Jegar Sahadutha, or heap of the testimony, 
implies. But in the internal sense it means the nature of the good confirmed by truths on the part of 'Laban', that is, on the part of those who perform works that are inherently good, that is, on the 
part of the gentiles. </p>

`Vocavit illum Laban Jegar Sahadutha': quod significet quale ejus a parte boni per Labanem repraesentati, constat a significatione `vocare' et `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua n. 144, 145, 1754, 
2009, 2724, 3421; `Jegar Sahadutha' significat acervum testimonii in idiomate Syriae, unde Laban.  Acervi tales antiquitus fuerunt in signum, aut in testem, ac postmodum etiam in cultum; hic in 
signum et in testem; in signum quod ibi esset terminus, et testis quod ibi foedus pactum, et quod nullus eorum transiret illum ad malum faciendum alteri, ut quoque constat a Labanis verbis, `Testis 
acervus hic, et testis statua, si ego non transibo ad te acervum hunc, et si tu non transibis ad me acervum hunc, et statuam hanc ad malum,' vers. 52 inde patet quid Jegar Sahadutha, seu acervus 
testimonii, involvit sed in sensu interno significat quale boni ex veris a parte Labanis, hoc est, a parte illorum qui in bonis operum sunt, hoc est, a parte gentium. </p>
