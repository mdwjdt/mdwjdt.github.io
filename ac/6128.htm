<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6128节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6128.</strong>“因换他们一切的牲畜，就给他们提供食物”表通过来自内在的良善之流注而维持。这从“提供食物”和“牲畜”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“提供食物”或给他们食物，是指维持属灵生命，如前所述（<a href="6118.htm">6118</a>节）；“牲畜”是指真理之良善，如刚才所述（<a href="6126.htm">6126</a>节）；提供它们的“约瑟”是指内在，如前所述。由此可推知，所提供之物通过来自内在的良善之流注而来，因为对属世层中的整个维持通过来自内在，也就是从主经由内在而来的流注实现。<br />流注这个词虽经常被提及，但恐怕很少有人知道流注是什么意思，所以有必要说一说流注是什么。流注的性质可通过对比自然界中所流入的那类事物看出来。明显的例子就是热从太阳流入地上的所有物体，产生植物生命；光也流入这些物体，协助产生植物生命，另外由此产生不同色彩和美景。同样明显的例子是热流入我们的身体表面，光流入眼睛，以及声音流入耳朵等等。由此能使人明白何为从主而来的生命流注，主是天堂的太阳，是属灵之热，即爱，和属灵之光，即信的源头。人也能明显感觉到流注本身；因为天堂之热，即爱，产生存在于人里面的生命之热；而天堂之光，即信，则产生存在于人里面的理解力之光。然而，这热和光照着他们接受的不同方式而各不相同。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6128</b></p><p><b>6128.</b>
And he provided them with bread [in exchange] for all their cattle. That this signifies sustenance through the influx of good from the internal, is evident from the signification of "providing with bread," 
or giving them bread, as being the sustenance of the spiritual life (of which above, n. 6118); from the signification of "cattle," as being the good of truth (of which just above, n. 6126); and 
from the representation of Joseph who provided them, as being the internal (as also above). That it was through the influx of good from the internal, follows, because all the sustenance of spiritual 
life in the natural is effected by means of influx from the internal, that is, from the Lord through the internal. As mention is so frequently made of influx, and perhaps few know what is meant by influx, 
it is necessary to state what it is. The nature of influx may be seen from a comparison with such things as inflow in nature, as from the influx of heat from the sun into all things of the earth, 
whence comes vegetative life; and from the influx of light into the same, whence comes what is helpful to vegetative life, and besides is the source of the consequent colors and beauties; in like manner 
from the influx of heat into the surface of our bodies, and also of light into the eye; in like manner from the influx of sound into the ear; and so on. From this it may be comprehended what is the 
influx of life from the Lord, who is the Sun of heaven, from whom comes the heat which is love, and the spiritual light which is faith. Moreover the influx itself is plainly felt; for heavenly heat, 
which is love, causes the vital heat which is in man; and heavenly light, which is faith, causes the intellectual light which is in man; but these are varied according to the reception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6128</b></p><p><b>6128.</b>
'And he provided them with bread in exchange for [all] their livestock' means the sustainment by means of an influx of good from the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'providing with bread', 
or giving them bread, as the sustainment of spiritual life, dealt with above in <a href="6118.htm">6118</a>; from the meaning of 'livestock' as the good of truth, dealt with just above in <a href="6126.htm">6126</a>; and from the representation 
of 'Joseph' who provided them with it, as the internal, dealt with already. From this it follows that what is supplied comes through an influx of good from the internal, for the reason that the entire 
sustainment of spiritual life in the natural is effected by an influx from the internal, that is, from the Lord through the internal. </p>

 Since the word 'influx' is used so frequently, and yet few 
perhaps know what it means, something therefore needs to be said about it. What influx is may become evident by comparing it with the kinds of things in the natural world that inflow. It may become 
evident for example from the flow of heat from the sun into all earthly objects, which gives rise to plant-life, and from the flow of light into the same objects, which assists plant-life and thereby 
in addition produces different colours and beautiful sights. What influx is evident in a similar way from the flow of heat into the surface-area of our bodies, and also of light into the eye. It is likewise 
evident from the flow of sound into the ear; and so on. These comparisons enable one to understand what the influx of life from the Lord is; the Lord is the Sun of heaven, the Source of [spiritual] 
heat, which is love, and of spiritual light, which is faith. One can also plainly feel the actual inflow, for heavenly heat, which is love, produces the vital heat that exists in a person, while 
heavenly light, which is faith, produces the light of understanding that exists in him. Yet such heat and light vary according to the different ways they are received. </p>

</p><b>6128.</b>
`Et providit illos pane pro {1}omni pecore eorum': quod significet sustentationem per influxum boni ab interno, constat a significatione `providere pane' seu dare illis panem, quod sit sustentatio vitae 
spiritualis, de qua supra n. 6118; ex significatione `pecoris' quod sit bonum veri, de qua mox supra n. 6126; et a repraesentatione `Josephi' qui providit illos, quod sit internum, de qua prius; 
quod per influxum boni ab interno, sequitur, quia omnis sustentatio vitae spiritualis in naturali fit per influxum ab interno, hoc est, per internum a Domino.  Quia tam saepe nominatur influxus, et forte 
pauci sciunt quid per influxum intelligitur, quapropter dicendum: [2] quid influxus, patere potest a comparatione talium in natura quae influunt, sicut ex influxu caloris a sole in omnia telluris, 
unde vita vegetativa, et ab influxu lucis in eadem, unde adjutorium vitae vegetativa, et praeterea inde {2}colores et pulchritudines; similiter ab influxu caloris in corporis nostri ambitum, tum lucis 
in oculum; pariter ab influxu soni in aurem, et sic porro; inde comprehendi potest quid influxus vitae a Domino Qui est Sol caeli, a Quo calor qui est amor, et lux spiritualis quae est fides; ipse influxus 
etiam manifeste sentitur; calor enim caelestis qui est amor, facit calorem vitalem qui est in homine, et lux caelestis quae est fides, facit lucem intellectualem quae in homine; sed variantur 
secundum receptiones. @1  omni here only$ @2 calores I$ </p>
