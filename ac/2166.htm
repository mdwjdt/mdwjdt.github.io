<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2166节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2166.</strong>“你们可以加添心力”表尽可能地接触。这从这些话近似的内义并不明显，然而从整个思路清楚可知。因为所论述的主题是神圣直觉，即它可以更接近那时主的人性所具有的直觉，也可以通过披上某种属世之物，以及伴随那属世之物的某种属天或天堂之物而使自身降下来，更接近祂的智性概念，尽可能地接触，也就是“加添心力”。就最近似的意义而言，通过饼来“加添心力”表示复活，从而享受那点属天之物所接触到的东西。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2166</b></p><p><b>2166.</b>
Support ye your heart. That this signifies as much as is meet, cannot be so evident from the proximate signification of the words in the internal sense, but yet it is evident from the series of things, 
for the subject treated of is the Divine perception-that this might draw nearer to the perception of the human which then appertained to the Lord, and that it might let itself down to His intellectual 
things, by putting on something natural and also something celestial adjoined to it, as much as was meet-which is to "support the heart." In the proximate sense, to "support the heart by bread" is 
to be refreshed, and thus to enjoy what little of the celestial is meet. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2166</b></p><p><b>2166.</b>
'That you may refresh yourselves' means insofar as it is in keeping. This is not so clear from the proximate meaning of these words in the internal sense, though it is nevertheless clear from the whole 
train of thought. The subject here is Divine perception - that it might draw nearer to the perception possessed by the Lord's human as it was at that time, and that it might bring itself down nearer 
to His intellectual concepts, by taking on something natural, and also something heavenly or celestial to go with that something natural, insofar as it is in keeping, meant by 'refreshing oneself'. 
In the proximate sense 'refreshing oneself by means of bread' means being revived, and so enjoying what little of the celestial is in keeping. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2166</b>
</p><b>2166.</b>
`Fulcite cor vestrum': quod significet quantum convenit, non ita constare potest a proxima significatione verborum in sensu interno, sed usque ex serie rerum; agitur enim de perceptione Divina, ut haec 
propius accederet ad perceptione in humani quod tunc apud Dominum, utque se demitteret ad intellectualia Ipsius, per id quod influeret aliquid naturale, tum aliquid caeleste ei adjunctum quantum convenit, 
quod est `fulcire cor;' in sensu proximo `fulcire cor per panem' est recreari, ita frui tantillo caelesti quantum convenit. </p>
