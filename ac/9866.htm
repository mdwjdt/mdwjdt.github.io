<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9866节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9866.</strong>“第一行”表在那里作为一体存在的三合一。这从“行”的含义清楚可知。“行”是指一个三合一，因为三块石头构成它，“三”表示从开始到结束的完整之物（参看<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="7715.htm">7715</a>，<a href="9198.htm">9198</a>，<a href="9488.htm">9488</a>节）。之所以说它们作为一体存在，是因为当按次序在最低层并排共存时，由这三者所产生的同步次序就对应于产生它们在最低层的共存并维持它的存在的连续次序（<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节）。正因如此，三层天堂在最后和最低层构成一体，这同样适用于每层天堂。这来源于神自己，祂里面有一个三位一体，即：神性本身、神性人身和神性发出；它们构成一体。构成一体的这神性三位一体就是主。由此可见为何每行都有三块石头，每行都表示作为一体存在的一个三合一。有四行的原因是，天上有两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度，每个国度都有一个内在和一个外在。胸牌右边的那两行代表属天国度的内在和外在；胸牌左边的那两行代表属灵国度的内在和外在；因为胸牌是双层、四方的。</p>

Row one. That this signifies a trine therein as a one, is evident from the signification of a "row," as being a trine, for three stones constituted it, and "three" signifies what is complete from beginning 
to end (see n. 2788, 4495, 7715, 9198, 9488). It is said, "as a one," because a one comes forth from three in successive order, for the consequent simultaneous order that comes-forth from these 
three when in order side by side, corresponds to the successive things from which they have come-forth, and from which they subsist (n. 9825). It is from this that the three heavens are a one in ultimates, 
and in like manner each heaven. This has its origin in the Divine Itself, in which is a Trine; namely, the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Divine which proceeds; and these are a One. This 
Trine itself, and the One Divine, is the Lord. From all this it can be seen why in each row there were three stones, and that by each row is signified a trine as a one. There were four rows for the 
reason that there are two kingdoms in the heavens, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom, and in each an internal and an external. The internal and the external of the celestial kingdom were 
represented by the two rows on the right side of the breastplate; and the internal and the external of the spiritual kingdom, by the two rows on its left side; for the breastplate was a doubled square. </p>

'One row' means a group of three there existing as one. This is clear from the meaning of 'row' as a group of three; for three stones constituted it, and 'three' means that which is complete from beginning 
to end, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="7715.htm">7715</a>, <a href="9198.htm">9198</a>, <a href="9488.htm">9488</a>. They are said to exist as one because a sequence of three makes one; for the resulting presence of three together, side by side at the lowest level, corresponds 
to the consecutive order which has given rise to their presence together on that level and maintains it, see <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>. So it is that the three heavens make one on the last and lowest level; and the 
same applies in each heaven. The origin of this lies in God Himself, in whom there is a Trinity, consisting of His Essential Divinity, Divine Humanity, and Divine Proceeding, which make one. And this 
Divine Trinity making One is the Lord. From all this it may be seen why in each row there were three stones and that a group of three existing as one is meant by each row. The reason why there were four 
rows is that in heaven there are two kingdoms, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom, and in each there is an internal part and an external. The internal and external of the celestial kingdom 
was represented by the two rows on the right side of the breastplate, and the internal and external of the spiritual kingdom by the two rows on its left side. For the breastplate was a square when 
doubled over.  </p>

`Ordo anus': quod significet trinum ibi ut unum, constat (c)a significatione `ordinis' quod sit trinum, nam tres lapides constituebant illum, et tria significant completum a principio ad finem, n. 2788, 
4495, 7715, 9198, 9488; ut unum dicitur, (x)quia unum ex tribus in successivo ordine existit, nam inde simultaneum ex illis tribus in ordine collaterali {1}correspondet successivis a quibus exstiterunt, 
et a quibus subsistunt, videatur n. 9825; inde est quod tres caeli unum sint in ultimis, {2} similiter quodlibet caelum; hoc trahit originem ex ipso Divino, in quo Trinum {3}, nempe ipsum Divinum, 
Divinum Humanum, et Divinum procedens, (d)et haec unum sunt; ipsum illud Trinum et unum Divinum est Dominus.  Ex his constare potest cur in unoquovis ordine essent tres lapides, et quod per unumquemvis 
ordinem significetur trinum ut unum.  Quod quattuor ordines {4}fuissent, est causa quia bina regna in caelis sunt, regnum caeleste et regnum spirituale, ac in unoquovis internum et externum; internum 
et externum regni caelestis repraesentabatur per binos ordines a dextro pectoralis, ac internum et externum regni spiritualis per binos ordines a sinistro ejus, nam pectorale erat quadratum duplicatum. @1
