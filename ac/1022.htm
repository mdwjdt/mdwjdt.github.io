"And I — yes, I — am setting up my pact with you and with your seed after you, and with every living soul that is with you: bird, beast, and every wild animal of the earth with you, from among all those coming out of the ark, including every wild animal of the earth."<br />And I — yes, I — am setting up my pact symbolizes the presence of the Lord in charity. With you symbolizes a spiritual person who has been reborn. And with your seed after you symbolizes those who are created anew. With every living soul that is with you symbolizes everything in general that has been reborn in us. A bird symbolizes our intellectual abilities in particular. A beast symbolizes what belongs to our new will in particular. Every wild animal of the earth symbolizes our lower capacities of intellect and will, coming from those higher ones. With you here again means with a spiritual person who has been reborn. From among all those coming out of the ark symbolizes people in the church. Including every wild animal of the earth symbolizes people outside the church. </p>

Verses 9, 10. And I, behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you; and with every living soul that is with you, the fowl, the beast, and every wild animal of the earth with

man; "and with your seed after you" signifies those who are being created anew; "and with every living soul that is with you" signifies in general all things in man that have been regenerated;

Verses 9, 10 And I, behold I, am establishing My covenant with you, and with your seed after you, and with every living soul that is with you - with birds, with beasts, and with every wild animal of 
the earth with you; from all that are going out of the ark, even every wild animal of the earth. </p>
<p>'And I, behold I am establishing My covenant' means the Lord's presence in charity. 'With you' means 
a regenerate spiritual person. 'And with your seed after you' means those who are being created anew. 'With every living soul that is with you' means in general all things which with a person have been 
regenerated. 'With birds' means specifically the things of his understanding. 'With beasts' means specifically the things of his new will. 'With every wild animal of the earth' means lower things of 
the understanding or will which derive from these. 'With you' here, as previously, means the things that reside with a spiritual regenerate person. 'From all that are going out of the ark' means members 
of the Church. 'Even every wild animal of the earth' means people outside of the Church. </p>

Vers. 9, 10.  Et Ego, ecce Ego, erigo foedus Meum cum vobis, et cum semine vestro post vos.  Et cum omni anima viva quae cum vobis, ad avem, ad bestiam, et ad omnem feram terrae vobiscum: ab omnibus 
egredientibus arca, quoad omnem feram terrae. 'Et Ego, ecce Ego erigo foedus Meum' significat Domini praesentiam in charitate: 'cum vobis' significat hominem regeneratum spiritualem: 'et cum semine vestro 
post vos' significat illos qui e novo creantur: 'cum omni anima viva quae cum vobis' significat in genere omnia quae apud hominem regenerata sunt: 'ad avem' significat in specie ejus intellectualia: 
'ad bestiam' in specie ejus nova voluntaria: 'ad omnem feram terrae' ejus inferiora intellectualia et voluntaria quae inde: 'vobiscum' significat, hic ut prius, quae apud hominem regeneratum spiritualem: 
'ab omnibus egredientibus ex arca' significat homines Ecclesiae: 'quoad omnem feram terrae' significat homines extra Ecclesiam. </p>
