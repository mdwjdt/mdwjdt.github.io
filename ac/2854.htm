<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2854节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2854.</strong>“因为你听从了我的声音”表通过主的人性本质与其神性本质的融合。这从上述内容清楚可知，这些话是上述内容的结论。“听从声音”表祂经历终级试探，因而将祂的人性本质与其神性本质融合起来。主通过不断试探和胜利将其人性与其神性，并其神性与其人性融合起来（参看<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>节）；祂凭这种融合拯救人类（<a href="1676.htm">1676</a>末尾，<a href="1990.htm">1990</a>，<a href="2016.htm">2016</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>节）。人类由此拥有一切救恩。人们普遍认为，父差子忍受最严酷的痛苦，甚至承受十字架的死亡；因此，祂因看见子的十字架受难和功德而仁慈地对待人类。但谁都能知道，耶和华并非因看见子而有仁慈，因为祂就是仁慈本身。不过，关于主降世的奥秘是：在祂自己里面，祂将神性与人性，并人性与神性融合起来，这种融合只能通过最严酷的试探才能成就。由此谁都可以认识到，只有凭借这种融合，救恩才有可能临到不再有属天和属灵之善，甚至不再有属世之善存留的人类身上。正是这种融合拯救了那些具有仁之信的人。正是主自己显明仁慈。</p>

Because thou hast hearkened to My voice. That this signifies by the union of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence, is evident from all that precedes, of which this is the conclusion. To "hearken 
to the voice" signifies that He underwent the utmost of temptation, and thus united His Human Essence to His Divine Essence. That the Lord united His Human to His Divine and His Divine to His 
Human by continual temptations and victories, may be seen above (n. 1737, 1813); and that by this union He saved the human race (n. 1676 at the end, 1990, 2016, 2025). From this the human race has all 
its salvation.  It is the common opinion that the Father sent the Son to suffer the hardest things even to the death of the cross; and thus that by looking upon the passion and merit of the Son, He 
has mercy upon the human race. But everyone can know that Jehovah does not have mercy by any looking upon the Son, for He is mercy itself; but that the arcanum of the Lord's coming into the world is that 
He united in Himself the Divine to the Human and the Human to the Divine; which could not be done except through the most grievous things of temptations; and thus that by that union it became possible 
for salvation to reach the human race, in which no celestial and spiritual, or even natural good, any longer remained; and it is this union which saves those who are in the faith of charity. It is 
the Lord Himself who shows the mercy. </p>

'Because you have hearkened to My voice' means through the union of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence. This becomes clear from all that has gone before and to which these words form a 
conclusion. 'Hearkening to the voice' means that He underwent the final degree of temptation and in so doing united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. The fact that the Lord united the Human to 
the Divine, and the Divine to the Human, by means of constantly occurring temptations and victories, see <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, and that by means of that union He saved the human race, <a href="1676.htm">1676</a> (end), <a href="1990.htm">1990</a>, <a href="2016.htm">2016</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>. 
The entire state of salvation in which the human race is kept is due to that union. It is commonly supposed that the Father sent the Son to endure the harshest sufferings, even to death on the Cross, 
and thus that by seeing the passion and merit of His Son would be merciful to the human race. But anyone may recognize that Jehovah is not merciful to the human race on account of what He may see 
the Son to have done, for Jehovah is mercy itself, but that the arcanum regarding the Lord's Coming into the world is that within Himself He united the Divine to the Human, and the Human to the Divine, 
which union could not have been effected except through the very bitter experiences brought about by temptations. And from this anyone may also recognize that by means of that union it was possible 
for salvation to come to the human race among whom no celestial or spiritual good, not even natural good, remained any longer. It is this union which saves those who possess the faith that is rooted in 
charity. It is the Lord Himself who shows mercy. </p>

`Propter quod auscultasti voci Meae':  quod significet per unionem Essentiae Humanae Domini cum Divina Ipsius, constare potest ab omnibus quae praecedunt, quorum haec est clausula; `auscultare voci' 
est quod ultimum tentationis subiverit, et sic univerit Essentiam Humanam Divinae; quod Dominus Humanum Divino et Divinum Humano univerit per continuas tentationes et victorias videatur n. 1737, 1813, 
et quod per hanc unionem salvaverit genus humanum, n. 1676 f, 1990, 2016, 2025; omnis salus generi humano est inde.  Communis opinio est quod Pater miserit Filium ut durissima usque ad mortem crucis 
pateretur, et sic quod per intuitionem in Illius passionem et meritum generis humani misereretur:  sed quisque scire potest quod Jehovah non per intuitionem aliquam in Filium misereatur, est enim ipsa 
misericordia; sed quod arcanum Adventus Domini in mundum sit quod in Se Ipso uniret Divinum Humano et Humanum Divino, quod non potuit fieri quam per gravissima tentationum, et sic quod per unionem illam 
salus posset pertingere ad genus humanum, in quo non amplius aliquid bonum caeleste et spirituale, ne quidem naturale, residuum erat; haec unio est quae salvat illos qui in charitatis fide sunt; 
est Ipse Dominus qui miseretur. </p>
