<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10194节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10194</strong>.“用金包裹它们”表一切事物都建立在良善的基础上。这从“用金包裹”的含义清楚可知，“用金包裹”是指建立在良善的基础上（参看<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>节）。必须简要说明“建立在良善的基础上”是什么意思。有些人以为，一切事物都建立在真理的基础上，但他们大错特错了；因为真理不可能与一个人同在，除非他拥有良善在自己里面。与人同在的真理若没有良善，就是某种没有一个内在的外在之物，因而是一个没有核仁的外壳；它只居于记忆之中。这种真理好比一幅画有一朵花、一棵树，或一个生物的绘画；它表面之下无非是泥土。而源于良善的真理不仅居于记忆之中，还深深植根于这个人的生命里，好比花朵、树木或生物本身，其完美越向内层增长；因为凡神性所造之物越内在，就变得越完美。这一点从来世的代表很清楚地看出来。在那里，代表照着灵人内层的状态而呈现为可见的形像，因为这些形像是对应。在拥有植根于良善的真理的灵人当中会看到极为美丽的代表或形像，即因黄金和宝石而闪闪发光的房子和宫殿，以及无法形容的美丽花园和园子。所有这些景象都是由于对应。但在那些拥有未植根于良善的真理的灵人当中，除了乱石丛生的地方、悬崖峭壁和池塘之外，什么也看不见；或有时会看见有灌木丛，不过，它们既不悦目又贫瘠；这些景象也是由于对应。然而，在那些沉浸于邪恶所产生的虚假之人周围则会出现沼泽、茅厕和许多可怕的景象。这些事物之所以如此出现，是因为在来世，一切代表都是照着内层事物的状态而成形的外在事物；因为灵界以这种方式使自己呈为可见。由此可见“建立在良善的基础上”是什么意思。</p>

And shalt overlay them with gold. That this signifies the foundation of all things upon good, is evident from the signification of "overlaying with gold," as being to found upon good (see n. 9490). What 
is meant by being founded on good shall be briefly told. It is believed by some that truth is that on which all things are founded; but they are very much mistaken; for no truth is possible with a 
man unless he is in good. The truth with a man which is devoid of good is an external without an internal, thus a shell without a kernel, residing only in the memory. This truth may be likened to a painting 
of a flower, of a tree, or of an animal, which inwardly is nothing but clay; whereas truth from good not only resides in the memory, but is also inrooted in the life, and may be likened to the 
flower, the tree, or the animal itself, the perfection of which increases toward the interiors; for that which has been created by the Divine is more perfect the more interiorly it is examined. This 
can be very clearly seen from the representatives in the other life. Representatives are there presented according to the states of the interiors among spirits, for they are correspondences. Around the 
spirits who are in truths from good appear most beautiful representatives, namely, houses and palaces flashing with gold and precious stones, also gardens and paradises of unspeakable beauty; all these 
things being from the correspondence. But around those who are in truths, and not from good, there appear nothing but stony places, rocks, and bogs, and sometimes shrubberies, but unpleasant and barren; 
these also being from the correspondence. And around those who are in falsities from evil appear swamps, privies, and many monstrous objects. The cause of this being so is that all the representatives 
in the other life are outward things shaped according to the states of the interior ones; for in this way the spiritual world presents itself to view there. From this it can be seen what is meant 
by being founded upon good. </p>

'And overlay them with gold' means the founding of all things on good. This is clear from the meaning of 'overlaying with gold' as founding on good, dealt with in <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>. What being founded on good is 
must be stated briefly. Some people think that truth is what all things are founded on, but they are very much mistaken; for no truth exists with a person unless he has good within him. Truth existing 
with a person which is devoid of good is something external without an internal, thus like a shell without a nut; it resides solely in the memory. Such truth may be likened to a painting of a flower, 
a tree, or a living creature; below the surface it is simply mud. But truth springing from good does not merely reside in the memory, it is also deeply implanted in the person's life, and may be likened 
to the actual flower, tree, or living creature, whose perfection increases the more inwardly it is examined. For with anything created by the Divine the more internal it is, the more perfect it becomes. 
This is made abundantly clear by representatives in the next life. The representatives there are visual images that accord with the states of spirits' interiors, for these images are correspondences. 
Around spirits in possession of truths rooted in good extremely beautiful images are seen, that is to say, houses and palaces flashing with gold and precious stones, and also gardens and parks 
indescribably beautiful. All these sights are due to correspondence. But around those in possession of truths not rooted in good nothing other than rocky places, cliffs, and ponds are seen; or sometimes 
places with trees are seen, but they are unattractive and barren. These sights too are due to correspondence. Around those however who are steeped in falsities arising from evil, swamps, latrines, 
and many other horrible sights appear. The reason why these things should be so is that all representatives in that world are outward figures shaped in accord with the states of inner things; for it is 
in this way that the spiritual world makes itself visible. All this goes to show what being founded on good is.  </p>

`Et obduces illos auro': quod significet fundationem omnium super bono, constat ex significatione `obducere auro' quod sit fundare super bono, de qua n. 9490. Quod sit fundare super bono, paucis dicetur: 
creditur a quibusdam quod verum sit super quo omnia fundantur, sed (x)valde falluntur, non enim datur apud hominem verum nisi ille in bono sit; verum quod apud hominem est absque bono, est externum 
absque interno, ita sicut putamen absque nucleo, residet {1}solum in memoria; hoc verum potest assimilari picturae sive floris, (x)sive arboris, sive animalis, intus in qua est modo lutum; at verum 
ex bono non {2}modo residet in memoria, sed etiam irradicatum est vitae, et assimilari potest ipsi flori, aut arbori, aut animali, quorum perfectio crescit versus interiora, nam quod a Divino creatum 
est, quo interius eo perfectius; hoc constare admodum manifeste potest ex repraesentativis in altera vita; repraesentativa ibi sistuntur secundum status interiorum apud spiritus, sunt enim correspondentiae; 
{3}circa spiritus qui in veris sunt ex bono, apparent (x)repraesentativa pulcherrima, nempe {4}domus et palatia fulgurantia auro et lapidibus pretiosis, ut et horti ac paradisi ineffabili pulchritudine; 
haec omnia ex correspondentia; at circum illos qui in veris sunt et non ex bono, non apparent nisi quam petrosa scopuli, et stagna, et quandoque arboreta, sed (x)inamoena ac sterilia; haec 
quoque ex correspondentia; circum illos autem qui in falsis sunt ex malo, (x)apparent paludes, latrinae, et plura monstrosa; causa quod ita sit, est quia omnia repraesentativa ibi sunt externa figurata 
secundum status interiorum, nam sic mundus spiritualis se {5}sistit ibi visibilem. Inde constare potest quid sit fundari super bono. @1 modo$ @2 solum$ @3 circum illos$ @4 palatia et domus$ @5
