<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第256节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>256.</strong>信被称为“女人的种”，主也是。这不仅因为独有主赐予信，即是信，也因为他乐意降生，进入一个堕落的教会，该教会已因我欲物欲而堕入了属地狱的、恶魔般的自我中。他降生，为要通过他自己的神圣大能，将他神圣的、属天的自我与他人性的自我结合起来，合而为一。若非成就这种结合，世界必已彻底毁灭了。正因女人的种是主，故经上不是说“它”，而是说“他”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]256.</strong> Not only faith is called "the seed of a woman;" the Lord himself is so called as well. This is partly because he alone gives us faith, so that he alone is faith. It is also because he chose to be born and in fact to be born into a religion that had sunk all the way down into a hellish, diabolical kind of selfhood, through self-love and materialism. He was born in order to unite his divinely heavenlike selfhood to a human one, in the context of his human nature, by the use of his divine power, so that they could become one inside him. Had he not united them, the world would have ended in total destruction.<br />Because the woman's seed is the Lord, then, the text refers to it as "he," not "it." </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 256</b></p><p><b>256.</b>
Not only is faith, but also the Lord Himself is called the "seed of the woman" both because He alone gives faith, and thus is faith, and because He was pleased to be born, and that into such a church 
as had altogether fallen into an infernal and diabolical Own through the love of self and of the world, in order that by His Divine power He might unite the Divine celestial Own with the human Own in 
His human essence, so that in Him they might be a one; and unless this union had been effected, the whole world must have utterly perished. Because the Lord is thus the seed of the woman, it is not said 
"it" but "He." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 256</b></p><p><b>256.</b>
Not only faith but also the Lord Himself is called 'the seed of the woman', because for one thing He alone imparts faith and so is faith itself, and for another He chose to be born, and in particular 
to be born within a Church which, on account of self-love and love of the world, had sunk completely into a hellish and devilish proprium. He did so in order that from His own Divine Power He might within 
His own Human Essence unite the Divine Celestial Proprium to the human proprium, so that they became one within Himself. Had He not united them the world would have perished completely. Since the 
Lord is accordingly 'the Seed of the woman', the seed is called 'He' and not 'it'.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 256</b>
</p><b>256.</b>
Fides non solum dicitur 'semen mulieris,' sed etiam Ipse Dominus, tam quia solus dat fidem et sic est Fides, quam quia placuit Ipsi ut nasceretur, et quidem in tali Ecclesia quae prorsus lapsa fuit 
in proprium infernale et diabolicum per amorem sui et mundi, ut ex Divina Sua Potentia uniret Proprium Divinum Caeleste proprio humano in Humana Ipsius Essentia ut in Ipso unum fierent; quod nisi univisset, 
periisset prorsus mundus: quia Dominus sic est 'Semen Mulieris,' non dicitur illud sed Ille. </p>
