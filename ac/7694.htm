Verses 16-20. And Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron; and he said, I have sinned to Jehovah your God, and to you. And now forgive I pray my sin only this once, and supplicate ye to Jehovah your 
God that He may remove from before me this death only. And he went out from before Pharaoh, and supplicated unto Jehovah. And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong sea wind, and took up the locust, and 
cast it into the sea Suph; there was not left one locust in all the border of Egypt. And Jehovah made firm Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let go the sons of Israel. "And Pharaoh hastened to call Moses 
and Aaron," signifies fear then of truth from the Divine; "and he said, I have sinned to Jehovah your God, and to you," signifies confession that they have not obeyed the Divine and the truth; "and 
now forgive I pray my sin only this once," signifies that their disobedience should not be regarded; "and supplicate ye to Jehovah your God," signifies intercession; "that He may remove from upon me this 
death only," signifies that this falsity may not torment; "and he went out from before Pharaoh," signifies separation; "and made supplication unto Jehovah," signifies intercession; "and Jehovah turned 
an exceeding strong sea wind," signifies the cessation of Divine influx through heaven; "and took up the locust," signifies the end of this state; "and cast it into the sea Suph," signifies into 
hell; "there was not left one locust in all the border of Egypt," signifies that these falsities in the extremes appeared no more; "and Jehovah made firm Pharaoh's heart," signifies that the infesters 
were determined; "and he did not let go the sons of Israel," signifies that they did not leave those of the spiritual church. </p>

Verses 16-20 And Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you. And now forgive, I beg you, my sin only this once, and plead with Jehovah 
your God, and let Him remove from upon me this death only. And he went out from Pharaoh, and pleaded with Jehovah. And Jehovah turned an extremely strong wind of the sea,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and it lifted the locusts 
and cast them into the Sea Suph. Not one locust was left in all the border of Egypt. And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart unyielding, and he did not send the children of Israel away. </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh hastened 
to call Moses and Aaron' means fear at this time of the truth from God. 'And he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you' means an admission that he had disobeyed the Divine 
and the truth. 'And now forgive, I beg you, my sin only this once means an appeal to them to disregard the disobedience. 'And plead with Jehovah your God' means intercession. 'And let Him remove from 
upon me this death only' means a plea that this falsity should not torment. 'And he went out from Pharaoh' means a separation. 'And pleaded with Jehovah' means intercession. 'And Jehovah turned an extremely 
strong wind of the sea' means a stoppage of the Divine inflow through heaven. 'And it lifted the locusts' means the end of that state. 'And cast them into the Sea Suph' means into hell. 'Not one 
locust was left in all the border of Egypt' means that those falsities in the outermost parts no longer made their appearance. 'And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart unyielding' means that the molesting 
ones remained obstinate. 'And he did not send the children of Israel away' means that they did not leave those belonging to the spiritual Church.

Vers. 16-20.  Et festinavit Pharao ad vocandum Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit, Peccavi Jehovae Deo vestro, et vobis.  Et nunc remitte quaeso peccatum meum, tantum hac vice, et supplicate Jehovae Deo 
vestro, et removeat desuper me tantum mortem hanc.  Et exivit a cum Pharaone, et supplicavit ad Jehovam.  Et convertit Jehovah ventum maris validum valde, et sustulit locustam, et conjecit illam mare 
Suph, non relicta locusta una in omni termino Aegypti.  Et obfirmavit Jehovah cor Pharaonis, et non dimisit filios Israelis.  `Et festinavit Pharao ad vocandum Moschen et Aharonem' significat timorem 
tunc pro vero (c)a Divino: `et dixit, Peccavi Jehovae Deo vestro, et vobis' significat confessionem quod non (x)oboediverit Divino (x)ac vero: `et nunc remitte quaeso peccatum meum, tantum hac vice' significat 
ne respiciant ad inoboedientiam: `et supplicate Jehovae Deo vestro' significat intercessionem: `et removeat desuper me tantum mortem hanc' significat ut falsum hoc non cruciet: `et exivit a 
cum Pharaone' significat separationem: `et supplicavit ad Jehovam' significat intercessionem:' et convertit Jehovah ventum maris validum valde' significat cessationem influxus Divini per caelum: `et sustulit 
locustam' significat status illius finem: `et conjecit illam in mare Suph' significat in infernum: `non relicta locusta una in omni termino Aegypti' significat quod falsa illa in extremis non 
magis apparerent: et obfirmavit Jehovah cor Pharaonis' significat quod infestantes se obstinarent: `et non dimisit filios Israelis' significat ut non relinquerent illos ab Ecclesia spirituali. </p>
