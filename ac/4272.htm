<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4272.</strong>创世记32:24，25.只剩下雅各，有一个人来和他摔跤，直到黎明。那人见自己胜不过他，就将他的大腿窝摸了一把，雅各的大腿窝正在同那人摔跤的时候就扭了。<br />“只剩下雅各”表已经获得并在此情况下成为良善的末后或终极形式的真理之良善。“有一个人来和他摔跤”表真理方面的试探。“直到黎明”表“雅各”所表属世良善与属天-属灵良善，也就是真理的神性良善结合之前。“那人见自己胜不过他”表祂在试探中得胜。“就将他的大腿窝摸了一把”表属天-属灵良善与“雅各”所表属世良善结合的地方。“雅各的大腿窝正在同那人摔跤的时候就扭了”表真理尚未拥有完全与良善结合的能力。<br />这两节经文也涉及雅各本人和他的后代，在这种情况下，它们表示这些人的本质。就这层意义而言，“就将他的大腿窝摸了一把”表示婚姻之爱与属世良善结合的地方；“雅各的大腿窝正在同那人摔跤的时候就扭了”表示在雅各的后代当中，该结合被彻底破坏和拆开了。 </p>

Verses 24, 25. And Jacob remained alone, and there wrestled a man with him until the dawn arose. And he saw that he prevailed not over him, and he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's 
thigh was out of joint in his wrestling with him. "And Jacob remained alone," signifies the good of truth procured, which was in this case the last or ultimate; "and there wrestled a man with him," 
signifies temptation as to truth; "until the dawn arose," signifies before the conjunction of the natural good signified by "Jacob" with the celestial spiritual or the Divine good of truth; "and 
he saw that he prevailed not over him," signifies that He overcame in temptations; "and he touched the hollow of his thigh," signifies where celestial spiritual good is conjoined with the natural good 
signified by Jacob; "and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint in his wrestling with him," signifies that as yet truth had not the power of completely conjoining itself with good. These same two 
verses relate also to Jacob himself and his posterity, and in this case the quality of these is signified. In this sense, by "touching the hollow of his thigh," is signified where conjugial love is 
conjoined with natural good; and by "the hollow of Jacob's thigh being out of joint in his wrestling with him," is signified that in the posterity of Jacob this conjunction was wholly injured and displaced. </p>

Verses 24, 25 And Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him until dawn came up. And he<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> saw that he did not prevail against him, and he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's 
thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. </p>
<p>'Jacob remained alone' means the good of truth, which had now been arrived at and was at this point the ultimate form of good. 'And a man wrestled 
with him' means temptation that concerns truth. 'Until dawn came up' means before natural good, meant by 'Jacob', was joined to the celestial-spiritual, that is, to the Divine good of truth. 'And he 
saw that he did not prevail against him' means that in temptations He conquered. 'And he touched the hollow of his thigh' means where celestial-spiritual good is joined to natural good meant by 'Jacob'. 
'And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him' means that truth did not as yet have the power to join itself completely to good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The same statements used here also 
have regard to Jacob and his descendants, in which case they are used to mean the essential nature of those people. Regarded in this sense the words 'he touched the hollow of his thigh' mean where 
conjugial love is joined to natural good, while the words 'the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him' mean that in the descendants of Jacob that conjunction had been thoroughly 
damaged and the two loves pulled apart.

Vers. 24, 25.  Et remansit Jacob solus is, et luctatus vir cum eo, usque ascendere auroram.  Et vidit quod non praevaleret ei, et tetigit volam femoris ejus, et luxata vola femoris Jacobi in luctando 
illo cum eo. `Remansit Jacob solus' significat bonum veri comparatum, quod tunc ultimum: et `luctatus vir cum eo' significat tentationem quoad verum: `usque ascendere auroram' significat ante conjunctionem 
boni naturalis per `Jacobum' significati cum caelesti spirituali seu bono Divino veri: `et vidit quod non praevaleret ei' significat quod in tentationibus vinceret: `et tetigit volam femoris 
ejus' significat ubi bonum caeleste spirituale conjungitur cum bono naturali per `Jacobum' significato: `et luxata vola femoris Jacobi in luctando illo cum eo' significat quod nondum potentia 
veri bono conjungendi se prorsus.      {1} Spectant etiam eadem ipsum Jacobum et ejus posteros, et tunc significatur quale (c)illorum; {2} in hoc sensu per quod `tetigit volam femoris ejus' significatur 
ubi amor conjugialis conjungitur bono naturali: et per quod `luxata vola femoris Jacobi in luctando illo cum eo' significatur quod prorsus illa conjunctio in Jacobi posteris laesa et emota.
