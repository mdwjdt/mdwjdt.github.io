<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3887节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3887.</strong>天堂或大人有两个国度，一个被称为属天的，一个被称为属灵的。属天国度由所谓的属天天使构成，这些天使具有对主之爱，因而具有一切智慧。因为与其他所有人相比，他们更居于主里面，从而更体验到平安和纯真的状态。在其他人看来，他们就像小孩子，因为平安和纯真的状态给予他们这种表象。那里的一切事物在他们眼里可以说都是活的，因为直接出自主的事物都是活的。这就是属天国度。另一个国度被称为属灵的，该国度由所谓的属灵天使构成，这些天使具有对邻之仁的良善。他们将生命的快乐置于以下事实：他们能向他人行善而无需回报。对他们来说，能允许他们行善本身就是一种回报。他们越这样意愿和渴望，就越体验到聪明和幸福，因为在来世，主照着每个人出于意愿的情感而发挥的功用赐下聪明和幸福。这就是属灵国度。<br />主的属天国度的居民全都属于心脏区域，而其属灵国度的居民则全都属于肺脏区域。从属天国度进入属灵国度的流注类似于心脏进入肺脏的流注，也类似于属心脏的一切事物进入属肺脏的一切事物的流注。因为心脏通过血管在全身及其各个部位进行掌控，而肺脏则通过呼吸在全身各个部位进行掌控。所以，全身各处可以说都有一个心脏进入肺脏的流注，不过，这种流注取决于那里的形态，还取决于状态。由此产生适合身体的一切感觉，以及一切活动。这一点从胎儿和新生婴孩的情形可以得到证明。肺脏被打开，随之一种流注从心脏进入肺脏之前，它们没有任何身体感觉，也没有任何自发行为。灵界也有类似情形，不同之处在于，那里没有肉体和属世之物，只有属天和属灵之物，就是爱之良善和信之真理。因此，他们的心脏运动取决于爱的状态，呼吸运动则取决于信的状态。这一个进入那一个的流注使他们拥有属灵的感觉和属灵的行为。这些观念在世人看来似乎自相矛盾，因为他对爱之良善或信之真理没有其它概念，只以为它们是某种抽象事物，并没有产生任何事物的能力。然而，事实恰恰相反。也就是说，一切感知和感觉并一切能量和活动，包括世人的，都源于爱之良善和信之真理。</p>

In heaven or the Grand Man there are two kingdoms, one of which is called Celestial, and the other Spiritual. The celestial kingdom consists of angels who are called celestial, and these are they who 
have been in love to the Lord, and thence in all wisdom; for they are in the Lord, and thereby they are pre-eminently in a state of peace and innocence. They appear to others like little children; for 
a state of peace and innocence presents this appearance. Everything there is as it were alive before them, for whatever comes immediately from the Lord is alive. Such is the Celestial Kingdom. The other 
kingdom is called Spiritual. It consists of angels who are called spiritual, and these are they who have been in the good of charity toward the neighbor. They make the delight of their life to consist 
in the fact that they can do good to others without recompense; to them it is sufficient recompense to be allowed to do good to others. The more they will and desire this, in so much the greater 
intelligence and happiness are they; for in the other life everyone is gifted with intelligence and happiness by the Lord, in accordance with the use he performs from the affection of the will. Such 
is the Spiritual Kingdom. [2] They who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom all belong to the province of the heart; and they who are in the spiritual kingdom all belong to the province of the lungs. The 
influx from the celestial kingdom into the spiritual kingdom is like that of the heart into the lungs; as also is the influx of all things of the heart into those of the lungs; for by means of the 
blood vessels the heart rules in the whole of the body and in all its parts; and the lungs in all its parts by the respiration. Hence there is everywhere in the body as it were an influx of the heart 
into the lungs; but according to the forms there; and according to the states. From this arises all the sensation as well as all the action that is proper to the body, as may be seen from the case of 
foetuses and newborn infants, which cannot have any bodily sensation, nor any voluntary action, until their lungs have been opened, and thus an influx established of the one into the other. The case is 
similar in the spiritual world, but with the difference that there are not there bodily and natural things, but celestial and spiritual ones, which are the good of love and the truth of faith. Hence 
the cardiac motions with those in the spiritual world are according to the states of love, and the respiratory motions are according to the states of faith; the influx of the one into the other causes 
in them spiritual sensation and spiritual action. These things will necessarily appear to man as paradoxical, from his having no other idea of the good of love and the truth of faith than that they 
are certain abstract things without the power of effecting anything, when yet the contrary is true, namely, that all perception and sensation, and all energy and action, even in man on earth, are from 
the good of love and the truth of faith. </p>

In heaven or the Grand Man there are two kingdoms, one called celestial, the other spiritual. The celestial kingdom consists of angels who are called celestial and are those who have been governed by 
love to the Lord and so by all wisdom. For they more than all others abide in the Lord and so more than all others experience the state of peace and innocence. To others they look like young children, 
for the state of peace and innocence gives them this appearance. Everything there is living so to speak in their eyes, for that which comes directly from the Lord is living. Such is the celestial kingdom. 
The second kingdom is called spiritual. This consists of angels who are called spiritual and are those who have been governed by the good that flows from charity towards the neighbour. The delight 
of life is considered by them to lie in being able to do good to others without reward. To them being allowed to do good to others is itself a reward. And the more this is their will and desire the 
greater the intelligence and happiness they experience, for in the next life the Lord confers intelligence and happiness on everyone according to the use which he performs from the affection that belongs 
to his will. Such is the spiritual kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Inhabitants of the Lord's celestial kingdom all belong to the province of the heart, and those of His spiritual kingdom all belong to the province 
of the lungs. The influx from the celestial kingdom into the spiritual kingdom is similar to the influx of the heart into the lungs, and also to the influx of all things belonging to the heart into 
those belonging to the lungs. For the heart reigns in the whole of the body and in every individual part of it by means of the blood vessels, as do the lungs in every individual part by means of the 
breathing. Consequently throughout the body there is so to speak an influx of the heart into the lungs, but this is dependent on the forms there and on the states. This is how all sensation arises and 
also all activity which belongs properly to the body. This point can also be proved from embryos and new-born infants. These cannot have any bodily sensation or any act of individual will until the 
lungs have been opened for them and an influx consequently takes place of heart into lungs. It is similar in the spiritual world, the difference being that bodily and natural things do not exist in that 
world but celestial and spiritual, which are the good of love and the good of faith. With them therefore motions of the heart are determined by the states of love, and respiratory motions by the states 
of faith. The influx of one into the other causes them to have sensations of things in a spiritual manner and to act in a spiritual manner. These ideas are bound to seem paradoxical to man because 
he has no other idea of the good of love or of the truth of faith than that they are some abstract qualities which have no power to effect anything. In fact the contrary is the case; that is to say, 
they are the source of all perception and sensation, of all energy and activity, including those in man. </p>

In caelo seu in Maximo Homine sunt bina regna, unum vocatur caeleste, alterum spirituale; regnum caeleste constituitur ab angelis qui caelestes vocantur, et illi sunt qui in amore in Dominum fuerunt, 
ac inde in omni sapientia, nam sunt prae aliis in Domino, et inde prae aliis in statu pacis et innocentiae; apparent aliis sicut infantes, nam status pacis et innocentiae illam apparentiam sistit 
{1}; vivit quasi coram illis quicquid ibi est, nam quod immediate a Domino venit, hoc vivit; hoc est regnum caeleste.  Alterum regnum vocatur spirituale; hoc constituitur ab angelis qui spirituales 
vocantur, et ibi sunt qui in bono charitatis erga proximum fuerunt; jucunditatem vitae in eo ponunt quod benefacere possint aliis absque retributione, hoc illis est retributio quod aliis liceat 
bonum facere; quo plus hoc volunt et desiderant, eo in majore intelligentia et felicitate sunt, nam quisque in altera vita intelligentia et felicitate a Domino donatur secundum usum quem ex affectione 
voluntatis praestat; hoc est regnum spirituale.  [2] Qui in caelesti regno Domini sunt, pertinent omnes ad provinciam cordis; et qui in spirituali regno, pertinent omnes ad provinciam pulmonum. 
 Influxus a caelesti regno in spirituale se habet similiter sicut influxus cordis in pulmones; </p>
<p>tum sicut influxus omnium quae {2} cordis sunt in illa quae pulmonum; cor enim in universo corpore 
et in singulis ejus regnat per vasa sanguinea, et quoque pulmo in singulis ejus per respirationem; inde est ubivis in corpore sicut influxus cordis in pulmones, sed secundum formas ibi et secundum 
status; inde existit {3} omnis sensatio, ut et omnis actio, quae propriae sunt corporis; </p>
<p>quod etiam constare potest ab embryonibus et infantibus recens natis; hi non aliquam {4} sensationem corpoream 
habere possunt, nec aliquam actionem voluntariam, priusquam aperti illis sunt pulmones, et inde influxus unius in alterum datus.  In spirituali mundo similiter se habet, sed cum differentia quod 
ibi non corporea et naturalia sint {5}, sed caelestia et spiritualia quae sunt bonum amoris et bonum fidei, inde cardiaci motus apud illos sunt {6} secundum status amoris, et respiratorii motus secundum 
status fidei; influxus unius in alterum facit ut spiritualiter sentiant et spiritualiter agant.  Haec non possunt aliter apparere homini quam sicut paradoxa, quia de bono amoris et vero fidei 
non aliam ideam habet quam quod sint abstracta quaedam absque potentia aliquid efficiendi, cum tamen contrarium est, nempe quod inde sit omnis perceptio et sensatio, et omnis vis et actio, etiam 
quae in homine. @1 facit$ @2 i in corpore$ @3 venit$ @4 i prius$ @5 sunt$ @6 est AI$ </p>
