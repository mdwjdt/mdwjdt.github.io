<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2991节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2991.</strong>属世之物代表属灵之物，它们相对应。这也可从以下事实得知：属世之物若没有一个先于它自身的起因，决无法产生。它的起因就存在于属灵之物中；在属灵之物没有自己起因的属世之物是不存在的。属世形式是结果，无法作为起因显现，更无法作为起因的起因，或最初源头显现。相反，它们照着它们所在之地的功用而接受自己的形式。然而，结果所取的形式代表存在于起因中的事物，这些起因继而又代表那些存在于最初源头中的事物。因此，一切属世之物皆代表那些存在于它们所对应的属灵之物中的事物，而这些属灵之物继而又代表那些它们所源于的属天之物中的事物。</p>

That natural things represent spiritual things, and that they correspond, may also be known from the fact that what is natural cannot possibly come forth except from a cause prior to itself. Its cause 
is from what is spiritual; and there is nothing natural which does not thence derive its cause. Natural forms are effects; nor can they appear as causes, still less as causes of causes, or beginnings; 
but they receive their forms according to the use in the place where they are; and yet the forms of the effects represent the things which are of the causes; and indeed these latter things represent 
those which are of the beginnings. Thus all natural things represent those which are of the spiritual things to which they correspond; and in fact the spiritual things also represent those which are 
of the celestial things from which they are. </p>

The representation of spiritual things by natural, and the correspondence of natural things with spiritual, may also be known from the consideration that what is natural cannot in any sense come into 
being without a cause prior to itself. Its cause exists in that which is spiritual. Nothing natural exists which does not have its cause there. Natural forms are effects and cannot appear as causes, 
let alone as the causes of causes, or first origins. Instead they take the forms they do from the use they perform in the place where they belong. Nevertheless the forms taken by effects represent the 
things that exist among causes, and these causes in turn represent those that exist among first origins. Thus all natural things represent those that exist among the spiritual things to which they correspond, 
and those spiritual things in turn represent those that exist among the celestial things in which they have their origin. </p>

</p><b>2991.</b>
Quod naturalia repraesentent spiritualia, et quod correspondeant, etiam sciri potest ex eo quod naturale nullatenus existere possit nisi a causa se priore; causa ejus est ex spirituali; naturale quod 
non inde causam ducit, non datur; formae naturales sunt effectus, nec apparere possunt sicut causae, minus sicut causarum causae, seu principia, sed accipiunt formas secundum usum in loco in quo sunt; 
sed usque formae effectuum repraesentant illa quae sunt causarum; immo haec repraesentant illa quae sunt principiorum; ita omnia naturalia repraesentant illa quae sunt spiritualium quibus correspondent; 
immo etiam spiritualia repraesentant illa quae sunt caelestium ex quibus sunt. </p>
