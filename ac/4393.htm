<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4393.</strong>“雅各来到撒冷，就是示剑城”表伴随着宁静状态的信之内层真理。这从“撒冷”和“示剑城”的含义清楚可知：“撒冷”是指平安的宁静，如下文所述；“示剑城”是指信之内层真理，如下一章论述示剑及其城市之处所述。因为“城”表示信之真理（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>节）。“撒冷”表示平安的宁静，这一点可见于诗篇：<br />在犹大，神为人所认识；在以色列，祂的名为大；在撒冷，有祂的帐幕，在锡安，有祂的居所；祂在那里折断弓上的火箭，并盾牌、刀剑和争战的兵器。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.1.htm">76:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处很明显，“撒冷”表示平安的宁静，因为经上说“祂在那里折断弓上的火箭，并盾牌、刀剑和争战的兵器”；这一点从这个名字在原文中的含义也能看出来，因为“撒冷”表示宁静和完美。至于何为平安的宁静，可参看前文（<a href="1726.htm">1726</a>，<a href="3696.htm">3696</a>节）。这种平安含有内层真理，也就是说，那些在信仰和生活上处于内层真理的人就会体验到平安。不过，只要人们处于外层真理，尤其正当从外层真理进入内层真理之时，那么他们的状态就不是宁静的状态，因为那时试探所造成的争战仍在进行。此处的雅各也代表了同样的情形，因为他由于以扫而惧怕和愁烦后，现在进入宁静的状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4393</b></p><p><b>4393.</b>
And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem. That this signifies the interior truths of faith which are of tranquillity, is evident from the signification of "Shalem," as being the tranquillity of peace 
(see below); and from the signification of a "city of Shechem," as being interior truths of faith (concerning which in the following chapter, where Shechem and his city are treated of). (That a "city" 
denotes truth in faith, may be seen n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2451, 2712, 2943, 3216.) That "Shalem" signifies the tranquillity of peace, may be seen in David: </p>
<p>     In Judah is God known, His name is 
great in Israel; in Shalem also is His tent, and His dwelling place in Zion; there brake He the live coals of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the war (Ps. 76:1-3); </p>
<p>where it is evident that "Shalem" 
denotes the tranquillity of peace, for it is said that "He there brake the live coals of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the war;" and also from its signification in the original language, 
for "Shalem" means tranquillity and perfection. (What the tranquillity of peace is, may be seen, n. 1726, 3696.) In this peace there are interior truths; that is, those who are in interior truths 
in faith and in life. But so long as men are in exterior truths, and especially when they are coming from exterior into interior truths, the state is then untranquil, for then there are temptation combats. 
The same is also here represented by Jacob, in that after he had been in fear and anxiety on account of Esau, he had now arrived at a state of tranquillity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4393</b></p><p><b>4393.</b>
'And Jacob came to Salem, the city of Shechem' means interior truths of faith which go with a state of serenity. This is clear from the meaning of 'Salem' as the serenity of peace, dealt with below, 
and from the meaning of 'the city of Shechem' as interior truths of faith, dealt with in the next chapter where Shechem and his city are the subject. For 'a city' means the truth of faith, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, while 'Salem' means the serenity of peace, as may be seen in David, </p>
<blockquote>
In Judah is God known, in Israel His name is great; and in Salem is His tent, and His dwelling-place 
in Zion. There He broke the bow's flashing arrows, the shield and the sword, and war. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2076:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 76:1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Salem' plainly means the serenity of peace since it is said that there He broke the bow's 
flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and war, as well as from the meaning of that name in the original language - for Salem means serenity and perfection. What the serenity of peace is, see <a href="1726.htm">1726</a>, 
<a href="3696.htm">3696</a>. Such peace involves interior truths, that is, it is experienced by those who in faith and life are governed by interior truths. But as long as they are governed by exterior truths, and especially 
while progressing from exterior to interior, their state is not one of serenity, for at that time the conflicts brought about by temptations are taking place. The same is also represented here by 
Jacob in that, following his fear and anxiety on account of Esau, he entered a state of serenity. </p>

`Et venit Jacob Shalem, urbem Shechemi': quod significet interiora vera fidei quae tranquillitatis, constat ex significatione `Shalem' quod sit tranquillitas pacis, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione 
`urbis Shechemi' quod sint interiora vera fidei, de qua in capite sequente ubi de Shechemo et ejus urbe agitur; quod `urbs' sit verum (x)fidei, videatur n. 402, 2268, (x)2449, (x)2451, 2712, 
2943, 3216; quod `Shalem' significet tranquillitatem pacis, constare potest apud Davidem,           Notus in Jehudah Deus, in Israel magnum nomen Ipsius,  et est in Shalem tentorium Ipsius, et habitaculum 
Ipsius in    Zione: </p>
<p>ibi fregit prunas arcus, scutum, et gladium, et   bellum, Ps. lxxvi 2-4 [A.V. 1-3]; </p>
<p>ubi quod `Shalem' sit tranquillitas pacis patet, nam dicitur {1}, quod `ibi fregerit 
prunas arcus, scutum, gladium, et bellum'; tum a significatione ejus in lingua originali, Shalem enim {2} est tranquillitas et perfectio; quid tranquillitas pacis, videatur n. 1726, 3696; in illa 
sunt interiora vera, hoc est, illi qui in interioribus veris fide et vita sunt; sed quamdiu in exterioribus veris sunt et cumprimis quando ab exterioribus venitur in interiora, tunc status intranquillus 
est, nam tunc pugnae tentationum: id quoque repraesentatur per Jacobum hic, quod postquam in timore et anxietate fuerit pro Esavo, nunc ad statum tranquillitatis pervenerit. </p>
