<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第210节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>210.</strong>关于人的自我，可这样描述：它是一切罪恶和错误，源于我欲和物欲，源于不信主及其圣言，只信自己，以为不能凭感官和知识了解的一切都不存在。由此，人全然堕入罪恶和错误，将一切颠倒，视恶为善，视善为恶，视假为真，视真为假，视有为无，视无为有，称恨为爱，称爱为恨，称暗为光，称光为暗，称死为生，称生为死。在圣经中，此等人被称为“瘸子”、“瞎子”。这就是人的自我，是属地狱的、被咒诅的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]210.</strong> To explain what selfhood is: Human selfhood is everything evil and false that wells up out of self-love and materialism. It is the tendency not to believe in the Lord or his Word but in ourselves and to think that what we do not grasp on a sensory or factual basis is nothing. The result of these tendencies is nothing but evil and falsity, which cause us to see everything backward — evil things as good, good things as evil, false things as true, and true things as false. That which exists we consider to be nothing, while that which is nothing we consider to be everything. We call hatred love, darkness light, death life, and the other way around. The Word calls people who succumb to this way of thinking lame and blind.<br />This, then, is human selfhood, which in itself is hellish and damnable. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 210</b></p><p><b>210.</b>
What man's Own is may be stated in this way. Man's Own is all the evil and falsity that springs from the love of self and of the world, and from not believing in the Lord or the Word but in self, and 
from supposing that what cannot be apprehended sensuously and by means of memory-knowledge [sensualiter et scientifice] is nothing. In this way men become mere evil and falsity, and therefore regard 
all things pervertedly; things that are evil they see as good, and things that are good as evil; things that are false they see as true, and things that are true as false; things that really exist they 
suppose to be nothing, and things that are nothing they suppose to be everything. They call hatred love, darkness light, death life, and the converse. In the Word, such men are called the "lame" and 
the "blind." Such then is the Own of man, which in itself is infernal and accursed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 210</b></p><p><b>210.</b>
What is the proprium? The human proprium consists of everything evil and false that gushes out of self-love and love of the world. It involves people believing not in the Lord or in the Word but in themselves, 
and their imagining that what they do not grasp through sensory evidence or through facts does not exist at all. They become as a consequence nothing but evil and falsity and so have a warped 
view of everything. Things that are evil they see as good, and those that are good as evil; things that are false they see as true, and those that are true as false. Realities they imagine to be nothing, 
and things that are nothing they imagine to be everything. They call hatred love, thick darkness light, death life, and vice versa. In the Word such people are called 'the lame and the blind'. 
This then is the human proprium which in itself is hellish and condemned.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 210</b>
</p><b>210.</b>
Ut sciatur quid proprium: est proprium hominis omne malum et falsum, scaturiens ex amore sui et mundi; et quod non Domino aut Verbo sed sibimet credant; putentque quod non capiunt sensualiter et scientifice, 
hoc nihil esse: inde fiunt non nisi quam malum et falsum; et sic perverse spectant omnia; quae mala sunt, vident ut bona, quae bona ut mala; quae falsa ut vera, et quae vera ut falsa: quae sunt, 
putant esse nihil, et quae nihil sunt, putant esse omne: odium vocant amorem, caliginem lucem, mortem vitam, ac vicissim: in Verbo vocantur tales 'claudi et caeci.' Hoc nunc est proprium hominis, 
quod in se est infernale et damnatum. </p>
