<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2732节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2732.</strong>我曾与天使谈论渴望的这种相互表达和接受的性质。他们说，一方的形像和样式就存在于对方的心智中；在这种情况下，双方共同生活在一起，不仅共享具体细节，还共享生命的至内层，主的爱与怜悯，连同幸福快乐会进入这样的一体中。他们还说，那些在世时就活在这种婚姻之爱中的人在天堂会象天使那样彼此在一起，共同生活，有时与他们的孩子一起生活。但如今罕有来自基督教界的人拥有这种生活，而来自属天的上古教会的所有人，和来自属灵的古教会的很多人都是这样生活的。那些天使还告诉我说，那些虽过着婚姻生活，但不是通过婚姻之爱，而是通过淫乱之爱联结起来的人在来世会分开，因为天堂容不下丝毫淫乱；那些互相厌恶，尤其彼此憎恨的人更会分开。双方进入来世后，绝不大部分会再度相逢，但经历诸多痛苦后，他们便分开。</p>

I have spoken with angels as to the nature of this mutuality and reciprocity, and they said that there is the image and likeness of the one in the mind of the other, and that they thus dwell together 
not only in the particulars, but also in the inmosts of life; and that into such a one the Lord's love and mercy can flow with blessedness and happiness. They said also that they who have lived in such 
conjugial love in the life of the body are together and dwell together in heaven as angels, sometimes with their children also; but that very few from Christendom at this day have so lived, though 
all so lived from the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, and many from the Ancient Church, which was spiritual. But that they who have lived in marriage, joined together not by conjugial love, 
but by lascivious love, are separated in the other life, because nothing of lasciviousness is tolerated in heaven; and that still more are those separated who have lived in mutual aversion, and more still 
they who have hated each other. When both first come into the other life, they for the most part meet again, but after much suffering are separated. </p>

I have talked to angels about the nature of this reciprocal expression and receipt of desire. They have said that an image and likeness of one partner exists in the mind of the other, and that in this 
condition the two live together, sharing not only the specific but also the inmost things of life, and that the Lord's love and mercy are able to enter with blessedness and happiness into such a oneness. 
They also said that those who during their lifetime lived in such conjugial love are with each other and live together in heaven as angels, sometimes with their children too. But very few enter 
heaven thus from present-day Christendom, whereas all who belonged to the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, and many who belonged to the Ancient Church, which was spiritual, did so. The angels 
also told me that those who lived in matrimony, yet were not held together by conjugial love but by licentious love, are separated in the next life - for no licentiousness at all is tolerated in heaven 
- and those even more so who disliked each other, and more so still those who hated each other. When both partners enter the next life, in most cases they meet each other, but after much suffering 
they are separated. </p>

</p><b>2732.</b>
Locutus sum cum angelis de hoc mutuo et vicissim quale sit, et dixerunt quod imago et similitudo unius sit in mente alterius, et quod sic non modo in singulis sed etiam in intimis vitae, cohabitent, 
et quod amor ac misericordia Domini in tale unum possit cum beato et felici influere.  Dixerunt etiam quod qui in vita corporis in tali amore conjugiali vixerunt, una sint et cohabitent in caelo ut angeli, 
quandoque etiam cum liberis; sed quod paucissimi sint ex Christianismo hodie, verum ex Antiquissima Ecclesia quae caelestis, omnes, et ex Antiqua Ecclesia quae spiritualis, multi: qui autem in 
conjugio vixerunt, {1} non conjuncti amore conjugiali sed amore lascivo, quod separentur in altera vita, quia nihil lasciviae toleratur in caelo; et quod magis adhuc separentur qui se mutuo aversati sunt; 
et adhuc magis qui se odio habuerunt; cum primum in alteram vitam ambo veniunt, ut plurimum conveniunt, sed postquam dura passi sunt, separantur. 	@1 i et.$ </p>
