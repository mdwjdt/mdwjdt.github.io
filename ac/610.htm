<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第610节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>610．创世记6:9 挪亚的后代记在下面。挪亚是个义人，在他自己那代人中是个完全人。挪亚与神同行。<br />“挪亚的后代”是对新教会的改造或重生的描述。“挪亚是个义人，在他自己那代人中是个完全人”意思是他能被赋予仁爱，“义”与仁之善有关，“完全”有仁之真有关；而“他自己那代人”则与信有关。“与神同行”跟前面论及以诺时一样，表信之教义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]610.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_610/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_9" target=_top>Genesis 6:9</a>. These are the births of Noah: Noah was a just and upright man in his generation. Noah walked with God.<br />The births of Noah mean a description of the way the new church would be refashioned, or reborn. Noah was a just and upright man in his generation means that the church was one that could be endowed with feelings of charity; just has to do with the good involved in charity, upright with the truth involved. The generation is a stage of religious development. Walking with God symbolizes the doctrine concerning faith here, as it did above where Enoch was discussed. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 610</b></p><p><b>610.</b>
Verse 9. These are the births of Noah; Noah was a man righteous and perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God. By "the births of Noah" is signified a description of the reformation or regeneration 
of the new church. That "Noah was a man just and perfect in his generations" signifies that he was such that he could be endowed with charity; "just" (or "righteous") has relation to the good of 
charity, and "perfect" to the truth of charity. The "generations" are those of faith. To "walk with God" signifies here as before, when said of Enoch, the doctrine of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 610</b></p><p><b>610.</b>
Verse 9 These are the generations (nativitates) of Noah. Noah was a righteous and blameless man (vir) among members of his own generation (generationes). And Noah walked with God.  </p>
<p>'The generations 
of Noah' means a description of the reformation or regeneration of the new Church. 'Noah was a righteous and blameless man among members of his own generation' means that he was such as could be endowed 
with charity, 'righteous' having regard to the good of charity, and 'blameless' to the truth of charity; while 'members of his own generation' has to do with faith. 'Walking with God' here, as previously 
when Enoch was the subject, means the doctrine of faith.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 610</b>
</p><b>610.</b>
Vers. 9.  Hae nativitates Noahi; Noah vir justus et integer fuit in generationibus suis; cum Deo ambulavit sibi Noah. Per 'nativitates Noahi' significatur descriptio reformationis seu regenerationis 
novae Ecclesiae: 'quod Noah vir justus et integer in generationibus suis' significat quod talis esset ut charitate donari posset; 'justus' spectat bonum charitatis, 'integer' verum charitatis; 'generationes' 
sunt fidei: 'ambulare cum Deo' significat hic, ut prius ubi de Hanocho, doctrinam fidei. </p>
