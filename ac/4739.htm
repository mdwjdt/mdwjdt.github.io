<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4739.</strong>创世记37:23-30.约瑟到了他哥哥们那里，他们就剥了他的外衣，就是他身上那件彩衣；他们拿住约瑟，把他丢在坑里，那坑是空的，里头没有水。他们坐下吃饭，举目观看，看哪，有一伙以实玛利人从基列来，用骆驼驮着香料、乳香、没药，要带下埃及去。犹大对他的兄弟们说，我们杀我们的兄弟，藏了他的血，有什么益处呢？来，我们把他卖给以实玛利人，不可下手害他，因为他是我们的兄弟，我们的肉。他的兄弟们就听从了他。有些米甸人，就是作生意的商人从那里经过，他们就把约瑟从坑里拉上来，以二十块银子把约瑟卖给以实玛利人。他们就把约瑟带到埃及去了。流便回到坑边，看哪，约瑟不在坑里，就撕裂自己的衣服。回到兄弟们那里说，孩子不在了！我往哪里去才好呢？<br />“约瑟到了他哥哥们那里”表当关于祂的宣告作出之时。“他们就剥了他的外衣”表他们除去并毁灭真理的表象。“就是他身上那件彩衣”表由源于良善的真理之性质所决定的表象之性质。“他们拿住约瑟，把他丢在坑里”表在虚假当中。“那坑是空的，里头没有水”表那时根本没有真理。“他们坐下吃饭”表将出于虚假的邪恶归为己有。“举目观看”表进一步的思考。“看哪，有一伙以实玛利人从基列来”表那些处于如外邦人所处的那种简单良善之人。“用骆驼驮着香料、乳香、没药”表内层属世真理。“要带下埃及去”表基于记忆知识的教导。“犹大对他的兄弟们说”表教会中那些反对一切良善的败坏者。“我们杀我们的兄弟，藏了他的血，有什么益处呢”表即便这真理被彻底摧毁，也得不到任何好处，或不会获得优越感。“来，我们把他卖给以实玛利人”表那些处于简单良善的人承认祂。“不可下手害他”表好叫他们无可指摘。“因为他是我们的兄弟，我们的肉”表因为从他们那里所得来的，都被接受。“他的兄弟们就听从了他”表顺从。“有些米甸人，就是作生意的商人从那里经过”表那些处于该良善的真理之人。“他们就把约瑟从坑里拉上来”表这些人所提供的帮助，好叫神性真理不在虚假当中。“把约瑟卖给以实玛利人”表那些处于简单良善的人对它的接受，以及那些坚持与仁分离之信的人对它的疏远。“以二十块银子”表对它的估价。“他们就把约瑟带到埃及去了”表请教记忆知识。“流便回到坑边”表总体上教会的信仰。“看哪，约瑟不在坑里”表信不复存在。“就撕裂自己的衣服”表哀恸。“回到兄弟们那里”表那些（出于信）教导的人。“说，孩子不在了”表对祂的信不复存在了。“我往哪里去才好呢”表现在教会在哪里呢？</p>

Verses 23-30. And it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of various colors that was on him, and they took him, and cast him into the 
pit; and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and saw, and behold a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing 
spices and balsam and stacte, going to carry them down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren, What gain is it if we slay our brother, and cover up his blood? Come and let us sell him to the 
Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him. And there passed by men, Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph 
out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt. And Reuben returned unto the pit, and behold Joseph was not in the pit, and he rent 
his garments. And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither do I come? "And it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren," signifies when it was preached 
about; "that they stripped Joseph of his tunic," signifies that they dispelled and annihilated the appearances of truth; "the tunic of various colors that was on him," signifies the quality of the appearances 
as to truths from good; "and they took him and cast him into the pit," signifies among falsities; "and the pit was empty, there was no water in it," signifies that there was then nothing true; 
"and they sat down to eat bread," signifies appropriation of evil from falsity; "and they lifted up their eyes and saw," signifies further thought; "and behold a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead," 
signifies those who are in simple good, such as the Gentiles are in; "with their camels bearing spices and balsam and stacte," signifies interior natural truths; "going to carry them down to Egypt," 
signifies instruction from memory-knowledges; "and Judah said unto his brethren," signifies the depraved in the church who are against whatever is good; "What gain is it if we slay our brother and 
cover up his blood?" signifies that there would be nothing of profit or of eminence, if this should be wholly extinguished; "come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites," signifies that they acknowledge 
it who are in simple good; "and let not our hand be upon him," signifies that they may be without blame; "for he is our brother, our flesh," signifies because what is from them is accepted; "and 
his brethren hearkened unto him," signifies compliance; "and there passed by men, Midianites, merchantmen," signifies those who are in the truth of this good; "and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of 
the pit," signifies aid from them that it might not be among falsities; "and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites," signifies reception by those who are in simple good, and alienation on the part of those 
who are in faith separate; "for twenty pieces of silver," signifies estimation; "and they brought Joseph into Egypt," signifies consultation from memory-knowledges; "and Reuben returned unto the pit," 
signifies the faith of the church in general; "and behold Joseph was not in the pit," signifies that there was no longer any faith; "and he rent his garments," signifies mourning; "and he returned unto 
his brethren," signifies those who teach; "and said, The child is not," signifies that there was no faith in it; "and I, whither do I come?" signifies where now is the church? </p>

Verses 23-30 And it happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of various colours that was on him. And they took him and threw him into the pit; and 
the pit was empty, there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and saw, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, and their camels bearing spices, 
and resin, and stacte,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> taking them down to Egypt. And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in our killing our brother and concealing his blood? Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, 
and let not our hand be upon him, because he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened. And men passed by, Midianites, who were traders; and they drew Joseph out and caused him to 
come up out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they led Joseph to Egypt. And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, there was no Joseph in the pit; and he 
rent his clothes. And he returned to his brothers and said, The lad is no more; and I, where do I go? </p>
<p>'It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers' means when a declaration was made concerning Him. 
'That they stripped Joseph of his tunic' means that they removed and annihilated the appearances of truth. 'The tunic of various colours that was on him' means the nature of the appearances which 
is determined by that of the truths derived from good. 'And they took him and threw him into the pit' means among falsities. 'And the pit was empty, there was no water in it' means that at that time there 
was no truth at all. 'And they sat down to eat bread' means making evil that was a product of falsity their own. 'And they lifted up their eyes and saw' means further thought. 'And behold, a caravan 
of Ishmaelites came from Gilead' means those in whom simple good is present like that present in gentiles. 'And their camels bearing spices, and resin, and stacte' means interior natural truths. 'Taking 
them down to Egypt' means teaching based on factual knowledge. 'And Judah said to his brothers' means the corrupt within the Church who are opposed to all good whatever. 'What profit is there in 
our killing our brother and concealing his blood?' means that no advantage would be gained, nor any supremacy, if that truth was completely destroyed. 'Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites' 
means that those in whom simple good is present acknowledge Him. 'And let not our hand be upon him' means so that they may be blameless. 'Because he is our brother, our flesh' means because that which 
is received from them is accepted. 'And his brothers hearkened' means acquiescence. 'And men passed by, Midianites, who were traders' means those in whom the truth partnering that good is present. 'And 
they drew Joseph out and caused him to come up out of the pit' means the help provided by these so that [Divine Truth] is no longer among falsities. 'And sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites' means the acceptance 
of it by those in whom simple good is present and the alienation of it from those adhering to faith separated from charity. 'For twenty pieces of silver' means the value set upon it. 'And they 
led Joseph to Egypt' means a consultation with factual knowledge 'And Reuben returned to the pit' means the Church's faith in general. 'And behold, there was no Joseph in the pit' means that no faith 
existed any longer. 'And he rent his clothes' means mourning. 'And he returned to his brothers' means those teaching [from faith]. 'And said, The lad is no more' means that no faith in Him exists. 
'And I, where do I go?' means, Where now is the Church?

Vers. 23-30.  Et factum, sicut venit Joseph ad fratres suos, et exuebant Josephum tunica sua, tunica variorum colorum quae super eum.  Et sumpserunt eum, et miserunt eum in foveam, et fovea vacua, 
nulla in illa aqua.  Et sederunt ad comedendum panem, et sustulerunt oculos suos, et viderunt, et ecce (t)comitatus Jishmaelitarum venit e Gilead, et cameli illorum ferentes aromata, et resinam, 
et stacten, euntes ad deferendum ad Aegyptum.  Et dixit Jehudah ad fratres suos, Quid lucri quod occidamus fratrem nostrum, et obtegamus sanguinem ejus?  Ite et vendamus eunt Jishmaelitis, et manus 
nostra ne sit in eum, quia frater noster, caro nostra is; et auscultaverunt fratres illius.  Et transiverunt viri Midianitae negotiatores, et extraxerunt, et ascendere fecerunt Josephum e fovea, et 
vendiderunt Josephum Jishmaelitis in viginti argenti; et adduxerunt Josephum Aegyptum. Et rediit Reuben ad foveam, et ecce nullus Joseph in fovea, et discidit vestes suas.  Et rediit ad fratres suos, 
et dixit, Natus non amplius, et ego quo ego venio?  `Factum sicut venit Joseph ad fratres suos' significat cum de Ipso praedicatum: `et exuebant Josephum tunica sua' significat apparentias veri 
quod discuterent et annihilarent: `tunica variorum colorum, quae super eum' significat apparentiarum quale quoad vera ex bono: `et sumpserunt eum, et miserunt eum in foveam' significat inter falsa: 
`et fovea vacua, nulla in illa aqua' significat quod tunc nihil verum: `et sederunt ad comedendum panem' significat appropriationem mali ex falso; `et sustulerunt oculos suos et viderunt' significat 
ulteriorem cogitationem: `et ecce comitatus Jishmaelitarum venit e Gilead' significat illos qui in bono simplici, in quali gentes: `et cameli illorum ferentes aromata, et resinam, et stacten' 
significat vera interiora naturalia; `euntes ad deferendum ad Aegyptum' significat instructionem ex scientificis: `et dixit Jehudah ad fratres suos' significat pravos in Ecclesia qui contra bonum quodcumque: 
`Quid lucri quod occidamus fratrem nostrum, et obtegamus sanguinem ejus?' significat quod inde nihil proficuum, et nihil altitudinis, si hoc prorsus exstingueretur: `ite et vendamus eum 
Jishmaelitis' significat quod agnoscant Ipsum qui in simplici bono: `et manus nostra ne sit in eum' significat quod {1} sint sine culpa: `quia frater noster, caro nostra is' significat quia acceptum 
quod ex illis: `et auscultaverunt fratres illius' significat condescendentiam: `et transiverunt viri Midianitae negotiatores' significat illos qui in vero illius boni: `et extraxerunt et ascendere 
fecerunt Josephum e fovea' significat auxilium ab illis ut non inter falsa: `et vendiderunt Josephum Jishmaelitis' significat receptionem ab illis qui in bono simplici, et abalienationem ab illis 
qui in fide separata: `in viginti argenti' significat aestimationem: `et adduxerunt Josephum Aegyptum' significat consultationem a scientificis: `et rediit Reuben ad foveam' significat fidem Ecclesiae 
in communi: `et ecce nullus Joseph in fovea' significat quod nulla fides amplius: `et discidit vestes suas' significat luctum: `et rediit ad fratres suos' significat docentes: `et dixit, Natus 
non amplius' significat quod fides in Ipsum nulla: `et ego quo ego venio?' significat ubi nunc Ecclesia.      @1 ut$ </p>
