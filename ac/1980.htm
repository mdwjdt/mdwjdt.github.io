<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1980节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1980.</strong>值得一提的是，当我醒来，讲述我在梦中见到的情景，并且这牵涉到一系列细节时，某些天使灵（不是前面所提及的那些），接着说，我所讲的与他们正在谈论的话题毫无二致，完全一样，并且绝没有什么不同。尽管如此，它们并非他们所谈论的那些事物，而是这些事物的代表物，他们的观念在灵人界被如此转化并改变为代表物。因为在灵人界，天使的观念会被转化为代表物。因此，他们所讨论的每一个事物都如此呈现在梦中。他们继续说，同样的讨论可能已转变为其它代表物，甚至以无穷的变化转变为相似或不相似的代表物。它们已转变为我梦中所看到的代表物，其原因在于，这一切是照着我周围灵人的状态，因而是照着当时我自己的状态发生的。总之，很多不同的梦或许是从同一场讨论，因而从一个源头降下来并被呈现出来。因为如前所述，人的记忆和情感中的事物是接受容器，观念在这些容器中照着它们形式的变化和状态的改变而代表性地发生变化并被接受。</p>

It is worthy of mention that when after waking I related what I had seen in a dream, and this in a long series, certain angelic spirits (not of those spoken of above) then said that what I related wholly 
coincided, and was identical, with the subjects they had been conversing about, and that there was absolutely no difference; but still that they were not the very things they had discoursed about, 
but were representatives of the same things, into which their ideas were thus turned and changed in the world of spirits; for in the world of spirits the ideas of the angels are turned into representatives; 
and therefore each and all things they had conversed about were so represented in the dream. They said, further, that the same discourse could be turned into other representatives, nay, into 
both similar and dissimilar ones, with unlimited variety. The reason they were turned into such as have been described, was that it took place in accordance with the state of the spirits around me, and 
thus in accordance with my own state at the time. In a word, very many dissimilar dreams might come down and be presented from the same discourse, and thus from one origin; because, as has been said, 
the things that are in a man's memory and affection are recipient vessels, in which ideas are varied and received representatively in accordance with their variations of form and changes of state. </p>

It is worth mentioning that when I have woken up and have related what I had seen in a dream, and this has entailed a length of detail, certain angelic spirits, other than those referred to above, would 
at that point say that such details were in exact agreement with and identical with the things which they had been talking about, and that absolutely nothing was different. Nevertheless it was not 
the actual details of their conversation but the representatives of those details into which their ideas were thus converted and changed in the world of spirits, for angels' ideas are transformed in 
the world of spirits into representatives. Consequently every single thing which they discussed was so represented in the dream. They went on to say that the same discussion could have been transformed 
into other representations, and indeed with endless variation into either similar or dissimilar ones. The reason they had been transformed into the representations seen in my dream lay in the state 
of the spirits surrounding me and therefore lay in my own state at the time. In short, very many different dreams may come down and present themselves from the same discussion and so from a single source: 
The reason for this, as has been stated, is that the things in a person's memory and affection are recipient vessels, in which ideas are varied and are received as representatives according to the 
variations in form which those ideas take and according to the changes of state which they undergo. </p>

Dignum memoratu est, postquam evigilatus cum referrem quid vidissem in somnio, et hoc longa serie, tunc quidam angelici spiritus, non ex illis de quibus supra, dicebant quod illa prorsus coinciderent 
et eadem essent cum illis rebus de quibus locuti inter se, et quod nihil prorsus differret, sed usque quod non essent illa de quibus sermonem habuerunt sed repraesentativa eorundem, in quae ideae illorum 
in mundo spirituum ita versae et mutatae essent; nam ideae angelorum in repraesentativa vertuntur in mundo spirituum; inde omnia et singula quae inter se locuti, ita repraesentata in somnio: dictum 
porro ab illis quod eadem loquela potuisset in alias repraesentationes verti, immo in similes et dissimiles cum indefinita varietate; quod in tales, fuisse secundum statum spirituum circum me, et 
inde secundum meum statum in quo tunc eram: verbo, quod perplura dissimilia somnia possint ex simili loquela, ita ab una origine, delabi et sisti, ex causa, ut dictum, quoniam illa quae memoria et affectione 
hominis, sunt vasa recipientia, in quibus variantur recipiuntur ideae repraesentative secundum formae eorum variationes et {1} status mutationes. 	@1 i eorum.$ </p>
