<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1391.</strong>交流既通过彼此交谈，也通过伴随形像的观念得以实现，因为构成灵人思维的观念同时具有表现形式，所有事物都以这种方式被充分展示出来。他们用一个观念表现的，比他们用一千句话所表达的还要多。但天使能觉察出隐含在这个观念中的东西，情感是什么，情感的来源是什么，它的目的又是什么，此外还有更为内在的其它事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1391.</strong> Spirits share these things with each other in conversation and through mental images accompanied by visual representations. The images that compose their thoughts also take visible form, you see, which allows everything to be presented in full detail. Spirits can depict more through a single mental image than they can express in a thousand words. Angels even perceive what lies behind the image, what feeling is connected with it, where that feeling comes from, what the purpose of it is, and many other inner aspects. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1391</b></p><p><b>1391.</b>
Communications are made both by conversation with one another, and by ideas together with representations; for the ideas of thought of spirits are simultaneously representative, and by this means all 
things are set forth in great fullness. They can represent more by a single idea than they can utter by a thousand words. But the angels perceive what is within the idea, what the affection is, what 
the origin of the affection, what its end; besides other things that are interior. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1391</b></p><p><b>1391.</b>
Communications are effected both through their conversation with one another, and through ideas and accompanying representations, for the ideas comprising their thought are at the same time representative; 
and in those ways all things are presented fully. Through one idea they are able to represent more than they can declare with a thousand words. But angels perceive what lies within the idea, what 
the affection is, what the origin of the affection is, and what its intention is, in addition to further things that are more interior. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1391</b>
</p><b>1391.</b>
Communicationes fiunt tam per loquelam illorum inter se quam per ideas et simul repraesentationes; nam ideae corum cogitationis sunt repraesentativae simul, inde copiose sistuntur omnia; per unam ideam 
plus possunt repraesentare quam per mille voces eloqui; sed angeli percipiunt quid intus in idea, quae affectio, quae origo affectionis, qui finis ejus, praeter plura quae interiora sunt. </p>
