<p><strong>[NCE]1212.</strong> The fact that as you come to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, as far as Lasha, symbolizes the falsity and evil in which that knowledge ends can be seen from the symbolism of those nations in the narrative and prophetic parts of the Word.<br />Falsity comes from two general sources. One is the cravings that constitute selfishness and materialism; the other is the religious and secular concepts yielded by flimsy reasoning. Falsity from these sources that tries to gain the upper hand over truth is symbolized by Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim.<br />Anyone can see that falsity and the evil stemming from it are the ultimate bounds of outward worship that has nothing inside. This kind of worship contains only what is dead. Wherever the people who practice it turn, they fall into falsity. They have no inner voice to guide them in the path of truth or keep them on it. They have only an external drive that carries them off wherever craving and delusion lead.<br />The narrative and prophetic books of the Word mention Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, so the specific symbolism of each will be told in the appropriate places, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg briefly discuses Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim as a group in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1212/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663" target=_top>1663:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1212/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1666" target=_top>1666:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1212/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1682" target=_top>1682</a>.

In coming to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha. That these signify the falsities and evils in which they terminate, can be seen from the signification of the same in the historical 
and prophetical parts of the Word. There are, in general, two origins of falsities; one is the cupidities that belong to the love of self and of the world; the other is knowledges [cognitiones et scientifica], 
through reasonings; and the falsities which thus originate, when they would domineer over truths, are signified by "Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim." That falsities and evils from them 
are the boundaries of external worship which is without internal, anyone may see. In such worship there is nothing but what is dead; and therefore whichever way the man who is in such worship turns, he 
sinks into falsities. There is nothing internal that leads and keeps him in the way of truth, but only what is external, which carries him whithersoever cupidity and phantasy lead. As Sodom, Gomorrah, 
Admah, and Zeboiim are mentioned in both the historical and prophetical parts of the Word, what each specifically signifies, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be there explained. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1212</b></p><p><b>1212.</b>
'As you come towards Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, as far as Lasha' means the falsities and evils which encompass them. This becomes clear from the meaning of these same locations when mentioned in 
historical and prophetical sections of the Word. In general falsities have two sources. The first group derive from the desires that belong to self-love and love of the world, the second from cognitions 
and facts by way of reasonings. Falsities derived in this way, when they wish to have dominion over truths, are meant by 'Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim'. The fact that falsities and derivative 
evils are the borders of external worship which is devoid of internal may become clear to anyone. Such worship has nothing within it other than that which is dead. Consequently whichever way someone 
turns whose worship is such he stumbles into falsities. There is nothing internal to guide him and keep him on the path of truth, only that which is external to take hold of him wherever evil desire 
and delusion lead him. Since Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim are all mentioned in historical and prophetical sections of the Word, the specific meaning of each one will in the Lord's Divine mercy 
be discussed in those places. </p>

'Veniendo ad Sodomam, Amoram, Admam, Zeboim usque ad Lasha':  quod significent falsa et mala in quibus terminantur, constare potest a significatione earundem in Verbi historicis et propheticis.  Sunt 
in genere binae origines falsitatum:  una est ex cupiditatibus quae sunt amoris sui et mundi; altera ex cognitionibus et scientificis, per ratiocinia; falsa quae inde, cum dominari volunt super vera, 
significantur per 'Sodomam, Amoram, Admam et Zeboim:  quod falsa et inde mala sint termini cultus externi qui est absque interno, unicuivis constare potest; in cultu tali nihil est nisi mortuum, quare 
quocumque se vertit homo qui in tali cultu, in falsitates labitur; nihil internum est quod ducit et detinet in via veritatis, sed modo externam, quod rapit eum quocumque cupiditas et phantasia.  Quia 
in Verbi historicis et propheticis memorantur Sodoma, Amora, Adma et Zeboim, quid unaquaeque in specie significat, ibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur. </p>
