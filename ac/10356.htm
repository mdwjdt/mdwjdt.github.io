<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10356节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10356</strong>.“你们务要守我的安息日”表关于神性本身与主之人身的合一的神圣、不断的思维。这从“安息日”和“务要守”的含义清楚可知：“安息日”在至高意义上是指神性本身与主里面的神性人身的合一，在相对意义上是指主的神性人身与天堂的结合，以及天堂与教会的结合，一般是指良善和真理在那些构成教会的人，或那些与教会同在的人里面的结合，关于“安息日”表示这种合一和这些结合，可参看前文（<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="8519.htm">8519</a>，<a href="8890.htm">8890</a>，<a href="8893.htm">8893</a>，<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节）；“务要守”，也就是务必遵守，是指以一种神圣的方式不断思想某个事物，因为当“守”论及在那个教会被代表的事物时，它表示思想被代表的事物，并把它们牢记在心，以一种神圣的方式珍惜它们。事实上，代表是体现内在事物，并因此为人们提供机会去思想内在事物的外在事物。这解释了为何“守耶和华的安息日”表示以一种神圣的方式不断思想主，思想神性本身与祂的神性人身的合一，思想主的神性人身与天堂的结合，并天堂与教会的结合，以及良善和真理在属教会的人里面的结合。由于这些教会真正的本质事物（因为没有对它们的承认和信仰，教会就不是教会），故经上最后谈及表示这些事物的安息日，并且一次又一次地谈及，直到本章末尾。</p>

But yet ye shall keep My Sabbaths. That this signifies holy thought continually concerning the union of the Divine Itself with the Lord's Human, is evident from the signification of "Sabbaths," as being 
in the supreme sense the union of the Divine Itself with the Divine Human in the Lord, and in the relative sense the conjunction of the Lord as to the Divine Human with heaven, also the conjunction 
of heaven with the church, and in general the conjunction of good and truth in those who are the church, or with whom the church is (that this union and these conjunctions are signified by "Sabbaths" 
see n. 8495, 8519, 8890, 8893, 9274); and from the signification of "but yet," that is, "by all means keeping," as being to have reverently and constantly in the thought. For when "keeping" is said 
of those things which were represented in that church, it signifies to have in thought and mind the things which were represented, and to worship them in a holy manner. For representatives were external 
things in which were internal, and which thus furnished a handle for thinking about internal things. Therefore by "keeping the Sabbaths of Jehovah" is signified to think holily and continually about 
the Lord, about the union of the Divine Itself with His Divine Human, about the conjunction of the Lord as to the Divine Human with heaven, about the conjunction of heaven with the church, and about 
the conjunction of good and truth in the man of the church. As these are the very essentials of the church (for without acknowledgment of them and faith in them the church is not the church), therefore 
the Sabbath (by which these things are signified) is spoken of last, and also again and again, up to the end of the chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10356</b></p><p><b>10356.</b>
'Surely you shall keep My sabbaths' means thought which is holy and goes on unceasingly regarding the union of Divinity itself to the Lord's Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'sabbaths' in the 
highest sense as the union of Divinity itself to the Divine Human within the Lord, and in the relative sense as the joining of the Lord's Divine Human to heaven and also the joining of heaven to the 
Church, and in general - with those who constitute the Church, or with whom the Church exists - as the joining together of goodness and truth (regarding that union and these joinings together, that they 
are meant by 'sabbaths', see <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8890.htm">8890</a>, <a href="8893.htm">8893</a>, <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>); and from the meaning of 'surely (or altogether) keeping' as thinking about something in a holy way and unceasingly, for when the word 'keeping' 
has regard to the realities that were represented in that Church, thinking about the realities that were represented, keeping them in mind, and cherishing them in a holy way, are meant. For representatives 
were outward things which embodied inner realities and which for this reason provided people with the opportunity to think about inner realities. This explains why 'keeping Jehovah's sabbaths' 
means thinking in a holy manner and constantly about the Lord and the union of Divinity itself to His Divine Human, about the joining of the Lord's Divine Human to heaven and the joining of heaven 
to the Church, and about the joining together of goodness and truth within the person belonging to the Church. Since these are the actual essential realities of the Church - for without the acknowledgement 
of these and belief in them the Church is not the Church - statements about the sabbath, by which those realities are meant, is talked about last, and again and again furthermore to the end of 
the chapter.  </p>

`Verumtamen sabbata Mea custodietis': quod significet sanctam cogitationem jugiter de unione (d)Ipsius Divini cum Humano Domini, constat ex significatione `sabbatorum' quod in supremo sensu {1}sint 
unio Ipsius Divini cum Divino Humano in Domino; ac in sensu respectivo conjunctio Domini quoad Divinum Humanum cum caelo, tum conjunctio caeli cum Ecclesia, et in genere apud illos qui sunt Ecclesia, 
seu apud quos Ecclesia, conjunctio boni et veri; quod illa unio, et hae conjunctiones per `sabbata' significentur, videatur n. 8495, 8510, 8890, 8893, 9274; et ex significatione `verumtamen' seu `omnino 
custodire' quod sit sancte et jugiter in cogitatione habere, nam cum custodire dicitur de illis quae repraesentabantur in illa Ecclesia, significatur in cogitatione et {2} mente habere illa quae repraesentabantur, 
et sancte colere illa; nam repraesentativa erant externa in quibus interna, et quae sic dabant ansam cogitandi de internis; inde per `custodire sabbata Jehovae' significatur sancte et 
jugiter cogitare de Domino, Ipsius Divini unione cum Divino Humano Ipsius, de conjunctione Domini quoad Divinum Humanum cum caelo, deque conjunctione caeli cum Ecclesia, ac de conjunctione {3}boni et 
veri in homine Ecclesiae. Haec quia sunt ipsa essentialia Ecclesiae, nam sine agnitione et fide horum Ecclesia non est Ecclesia, ideo de sabbato, per quod illa significantur, ultimo dicitur, et quoque 
iterum et iterum usque ad finem capitis. @1 sit$ @2 i in$ @3 veri et boni$ </p>
