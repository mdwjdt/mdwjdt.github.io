<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2993节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2993.</strong>植物王国中的事物也一样。凡那里所存在的任何事物，哪怕是最小的事物，无不代表灵界的某种事物，并与之相对应，正如我通过与天使频繁互动所得知的那样。我还被告知全部起因，也就是说，一切属世之物的起因皆来自属灵之物，这些起因的初始则来自属天之物。或也可说，尘世中一切事物的起因皆源于属灵的真理，其初始皆源于属天的良善。此外，我被告知，属世之物以这种方式照着主国度中真理和良善的各种不同从真理和良善发出，因而从主自己，就是一切良善与真理的源头发出。这些事必定显得很奇怪，尤其对那些不愿，或不能允许自己的思维上升至自然界之上，以及不知道何谓属灵之物，因此不承认它的存在之人来说，更是如此。</p>

The case is similar with the things in the vegetable kingdom; for nothing whatever exists there that does not represent something in the spiritual world, and correspond thereto; as has been frequently 
given me to know by a like interaction with angels. The causes also have been told me, namely, that the causes of all natural things are from spiritual things, and the beginnings of these causes are 
from celestial things; or what is the same, all things in the natural world derive their cause from truth which is the spiritual, and their beginning from good which is the celestial; and natural things 
proceed thence according to all the differences of truth and of good in the Lord's kingdom; thus from the Lord Himself, from whom is all good and truth. These things must needs appear strange, especially 
to those who will not or cannot ascend in thought beyond nature, and who do not know what the spiritual is, and therefore do not acknowledge it. </p>

It is similar with things in the vegetable kingdom. Not even the smallest thing exists there which does not represent something in the spiritual world and correspond to it, as I have been given to know 
many times through a similar contact with angels. I have also been told all about causes, that is to say, that the causes of all natural objects exist from among spiritual things, and the first beginnings 
of causes from among celestial things. Or what amounts to the same, all things in the natural world derive their cause from truth which is spiritual, and their first beginning from good which 
is celestial. In addition I have been told that natural objects come forth in this way from truth and good according to all the variations of truth or good which exist in the Lord's kingdom, and so come 
forth from the Lord, the source of all goodness and truth. These matters are bound to seem strange, especially to those who refuse, or who are unable, to allow their thought to go beyond the natural 
order, and who do not know what is meant by that which is spiritual and do not therefore acknowledge the existence of it. </p>

</p><b>2993.</b>
Similiter se habet cum illis quae in regno vegetabili sunt; ibi ne hilum datur quod non aliquid repraesentat in mundo spirituali, et ei correspondet, quod multoties per simile commercium cum angelis 
scire datum: causae etiam mihi dictae sunt, quod nempe causae omnium rerum naturalium sint e spiritualibus, et principia causarum e caelestibus; seu quod idem, quod omnia quae in mundo naturali sunt, 
causam ducant a vero quod est spirituale, et principium a bono quod est caeleste; et quod naturalia procedant inde secundum omnes differentias veri et boni quae in regno Domini, ita ab Ipso Domino a 
Quo omne bonum et verum.  Haec non possunt non ut peregrina videri, imprimis illis qui ultra naturam cogitatione ascendere nolunt vel nequeunt; et qui non sciunt quid spirituale, ac ideo nec agnoscunt. </p>
