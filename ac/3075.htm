Verses 15, 16. And it came to pass that scarcely had he done speaking, when behold Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher 
upon her shoulder. And the damsel was exceeding good to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up. "And it came to pass 
that scarcely had he done speaking" signifies the effect of will; "when behold Rebekah came out," signifies the affection of truth from doctrinal things; "who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the 
wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother," signifies all the origin of this affection; "with her pitcher upon her shoulder," signifies receptions of truth, and endeavor; "and the damsel was exceeding good 
to look upon," signifies the beauty of the affection of truth; "a virgin, neither had any man known her," signifies pure from all falsity; "and she went down to the fountain," signifies truth Divine; 
"and filled her pitcher," signifies the vessels of reception; "and came up," signifies elevation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3075</b></p><p><b>3075.</b>
Verses 15, 16 And so it was, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milkah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother; and her pitcher was on her 
shoulder. And the girl was very good looking, a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher, and went up. </p>
<p>'And so it was, before he had finished speaking' 
means the realization of what he willed. 'That behold, Rebekah came out' means the affection for truth coming from matters of doctrine. 'Who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milkah, the wife of 
Nahor, Abraham's brother' means the whole origin of that affection. 'And her pitcher was on her shoulder' means vessels that receive truth, and a total effort to uphold that truth. 'And the girl was very 
good looking' means the beauty of the affection for truth. 'A virgin, and no man had known her' means pure from everything false. 'And she went down to the spring' means Divine truth. 'And filled 
her pitcher' means vessels for receiving. 'And went up' means a raising up. </p>

Vers. 15, 16.  Et fuit, ille vix absolvit loqui, et ecce Rebecca exit, quae nata Bethueli filio Milkae uxoris Nahoris fratris Abrahami, et cadus ejus super humero ejus.  Et puella bona aspectu valde, 
virgo, et vir non cognoverat illam, et descendit ad fontem, et implevit cadum suum, et ascendit.  `Et fuit, ille vix absolvit loqui' significat voluntatis effectum: `et ecce Rebecca exit' significat 
affectionem veri ex doctrinalibus: `quae nata Bethueli filio Milkae uxoris Nahoris fratris Abrahami' significat omnem originem illius affectionis: `et cadus ejus super humero ejus' significat receptiones 
veri, et connisum: `et puella bona aspectu valde' significat affectionis veri pulchritudinem: `virgo, et vir non cognoverat illam' significat purum ab omni falso: `et descendit ad fontem' significat 
verum Divinum: `et implevit cadum suum' significat vasa receptionis: `et ascendit' significat elevationem. </p>
