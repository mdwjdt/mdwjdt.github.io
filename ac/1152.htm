<p><strong>[NCE]1152.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1152/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_3-4" target=_top>Genesis 10:3-4</a>. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.<br />The sons of Gomer also symbolize people who engaged in outward worship, but in a form of it that developed out of the kind adopted by the nation of Gomer. Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah were individual nations where this form of worship existed, and they also symbolize individual doctrinal systems that consisted in rituals derived from the outward worship adopted by Gomer. The sons of Javan symbolize yet another group: those who had an outward form of worship that developed out of the worship adopted by the nation of Javan. Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim were individual nations where this form of worship existed, and they also symbolize individual doctrinal systems that consisted in rituals derived from the outward worship adopted by Javan. </p>

Verses 3, 4. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. By the "sons of Gomer" also are signified those who had external 
worship, but derived from that which existed in the nation Gomer. "Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah" were so many nations, among whom there was such worship, by whom also are signified so many 
doctrinals which were rituals, derived from the external worship with Gomer; by the "sons of Javan" are signified still others with whom external worship existed, derived from the worship which was 
in the nation Javan; "Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim" were so many nations among whom such worship existed, by whom also are signified so many doctrinals which were rituals, derived from the 
external worship with Javan. </p>

Verses 3, 4 And the sons of Gomer Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. </p>
<p>'The sons of Gomer' also means those who possessed external 
worship, but an external worship derived from that which existed with the nation 'Gomer'. 'Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah' were just so many nations with whom such worship existed, and who also mean 
just so many types of matters of doctrine which were forms of ritual, derived from the external worship existing with 'Gomer'. 'The sons of Javan' means others again with whom there existed external 
worship derived from the worship existing with the nation 'Javan'. 'Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim' were just so many nations with whom such worship existed, and who also mean just so many types 
of matters of doctrine which were forms of ritual, derived from the external worship existing with 'Javan'. </p>

Vers. 3, 4.  Et filii Gomer; Ashkenaz, et Riphath, et Togarmah.  Et filii Javan; Elishah, et Tarshish, Kittim, et Dodanim.  Per 'filios Gomer' significantur etiam illi qui externum cultum habuerunt, 
sed derivatum ab illo fuit apud gentem 'Gomer':  'Ashkenaz, Riphath et Togarmah' fuerunt totidem gentes apud quas talis cultus fuit, per quas etiam significantur totidem doctrinalia, quae fuerunt ritualia, 
derivata a cultu externo apud 'Gomerem':  per 'filios Javan' significantur adhuc alii quibus fuit externus cultus derivatus a cultu qui fuit apud gentem 'Javan':  'Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim et 
Dodanim' fuerunt totidem gentes apud quas talis cultus fuit, per quas etiam significantur totidem doctrinalia, quae fuerunt ritualia, derivata a cultu externo apud 'Javan.' </p>
