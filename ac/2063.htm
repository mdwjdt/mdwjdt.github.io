<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2063节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2063.</strong>“不可再称她的名为撒莱，她的名要叫撒拉”表祂要脱去人性，披上神性。这从前面有关亚伯拉罕的经文（17:5）清楚可知，在那里，经上说“你的名不再叫亚伯兰，你的名要叫亚伯拉罕”，这些话同样表示祂要脱去人性，披上神性（参看<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>节）。事实上，加到撒拉名字上的这个字母“H”取自耶和华之名，是为了撒拉和亚伯拉罕一样，可以代表主的神性，也就是说，是为了代表主里面良善与真理的神性婚姻。其中，“亚伯拉罕”是神性良善，“撒拉”是神性真理。神圣理性，也就是以撒，要通过该婚姻出生。<br />神性良善本身是爱，就整个人类而言，是怜悯。它就是主的内在，即耶和华，耶和华是良善本身。这良善由亚伯拉罕来代表。要与神性良善结合的真理由撒莱来代表，这真理一旦也变成神性，就由撒拉来代表，因为主逐渐朝着与耶和华的融合发展，如前面各处所提到的。尚未变成神性的真理由撒莱代表，这时，它尚未与良善完全融合到成为源于良善的真理的程度。不过，一旦它与良善完全融合到源于良善的程度，那么就在这时，它就是神性。在这种情况下，真理本身也是良善，因为它是良善的真理。真理趋向良善以便能与良善结合是一回事，而真理与良善融合到完全源于良善的程度则是另一回事。趋向良善的真理仍从人性那里获取某种东西。不过，它一旦与良善完全融合，就会抛弃人性的一切，披上神性。<br />和前面一样，这个问题也能通过发生在人身上的事来说明。当人正经历重生，也就是要与主结合时，他会凭借真理，即信之真理朝那结合行进。因为若不凭借信的认知，没人能重生，而信的认知就是他朝这结合行进所凭借的真理。主凭良善，即仁爱触及这些真理，并将这仁爱引入信的认知，即它的真理中。因为一切真理都是接受良善的容器，故真理越纯正，就越增多，良善也越大量接受作为容器的真理，使它们归入秩序，最终显明自身，以致最后真理不再显现，除非良善透过它们闪耀。真理以这种方式变得属天-属灵。主唯独存在于仁爱所流出的良善中，故人以这种方式与主结合，并凭借良善，即仁爱而拥有赋予他的良知。然后，他通过这良知思考何为真理，何为正义。不过，这良知与已引入良善或仁爱的真理并正义保持一致。</p>

Thou shalt not call her name Sarai, for Sarah is her name. That this signifies that He will put off the human, and will put on the Divine, is evident from what was said of Abraham above (verse 5), where 
occur the words, "thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham," by which in like manner there is signified that He will put off the human, and will put on the Divine (see 
n. 2009). For the letter H which was added to the name "Sarah," was taken from the name "Jehovah," so that Sarah, like Abraham, should represent the Lord's Divine; and that thus should be represented 
the Divine marriage of Good with Truth in the Lord-Abraham representing the Divine Good, and Sarah the Divine Truth-from which should be born the Divine Rational, which is Isaac.  [2] The Divine Good, 
which is Love, and which in regard to the whole human race is Mercy, was the Lord's Internal, that is, Jehovah, who is  itself: this is represented by Abraham. The truth that was to be conjoined with 
the Divine Good was represented by Sarai; and this truth when also made Divine is represented by Sarah; for the Lord advanced to union with Jehovah successively, as already said. The truth not yet 
Divine represented by Sarai, was such when it was not yet so united to good as to be truth from good. But when it was so united to good as to proceed from good, it was then Divine; and the truth itself 
was then also good, because it was the truth of good. The truth which tends to good in order that it may be united to good, is one thing; and that which is so united to good as to proceed wholly from 
good, is another. The truth which is tending to good still derives something from the human; but that which is wholly united to good has put off all that is human, and has put on the Divine.  [3] This 
may be illustrated as before, by what is similar with man. When a man is being regenerated, that is, when he is to be conjoined with the Lord, he proceeds to the conjunction by means of truth, that 
is, by means of the truths of faith; for no one can be regenerated except by means of the knowledges of faith, which are the truths by means of which he proceeds to conjunction. The Lord goes to meet 
these by means of good, that is, by means of charity, and adjusts and fits this in to the knowledges of faith, that is, to its truths; for all truths are recipient vessels of good, and therefore the 
more genuine the truths are, and the more they are multiplied, the more abundantly can good accept them as vessels, reduce them to order, and finally manifest itself; so that at last the truths do not 
appear, except insofar as good shines through them. In this way truth becomes the celestial spiritual.  As the Lord is present solely in the good which is of charity, the man is in this way conjoined 
with the Lord, and by means of good, that is, by means of charity, is gifted with conscience, from which he afterwards thinks what is true and does what is right; but this conscience is in accordance 
with the truths and right things into which the good or charity is adjusted and fitted. </p>

'You will not call by her name Sarai, for Sarah will be her name' means that He will cast off the human and put on the Divine. This is clear from what has been stated at verse 5 above regarding Abraham, 
where it is said, 'No longer will your name be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham', words which in a similar way mean that He will cast off the human and put on the Divine, dealt with in <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>. Indeed the letter H added to Sarah's name was taken from the name of Jehovah, in order that Sarah, like Abraham, might represent the Lord's Divine, that is to say, in order that the Divine marriage 
of Good and Truth in the Lord might be represented - 'Abraham' being Divine Good and 'Sarah' Divine Truth. And from that marriage the Divine Rational, which is Isaac, was to be born. </p>

 Divine 
Good, which in itself is love, and in relation to the entire human race is mercy, was the Lord's Internal, that is, Jehovah, who is Good itself. This Good is represented by 'Abraham'. Truth that was 
to be joined to Divine Good was represented by 'Sarai', but once this too has become Divine, it is represented by 'Sarah', for the Lord advanced towards union with Jehovah gradually, as mentioned in various 
places above. 'Sarai' represented truth not yet Divine - when it was still not so thoroughly united to Good that Good was the source of truth. But once it was so thoroughly united to Good that 
it stemmed from Good it was at that point Divine, and Truth itself was in that case also Good since it was truth inhering in Good. Truth tending towards good so that it may be united to good is one thing, 
while truth so united to good that it stems completely from good is another. Truth tending towards good is still drawing on something of what is human, but once it is united completely to good it 
casts aside everything that is human and takes on what is Divine. </p>

 This matter, like others previously, can be illustrated by what occurs with man. When a person is being regenerated, that is, 
when he is to be joined to the Lord, he moves towards that conjunction by means of truth, that is, by means of the truths of faith, for nobody can be regenerated except by means of cognitions of faith, 
which are the truths by means of which he moves towards such conjunction. These truths the Lord goes to meet by way of good, that is, of charity, and introduces this charity into the cognitions of faith, 
that is, into its truths. For all truths are the recipient vessels of good; and therefore the more genuine the truths are and the more they are multiplied, the more abundantly is good able to accept 
them as vessels, to bring them into a state of order, and only then to reveal itself, doing so in the end in such a way that the truths are not seen, except insofar as good shines through them. In 
this way truth becomes celestial-spiritual. And since the Lord is present solely within the good that flows from charity, a person is in this manner joined to the Lord, and by means of good, that is, 
of charity, has conscience conferred on him, from which he then thinks what is true and does what is right. But this conscience is a conscience in keeping with the truths and the things that are right 
into which good or charity has been introduced. </p>

Quod `non vocabis nomine ejus Sarai, quoniam Sarah nomen illius' significet quod exuet humanum, et induet Divinum, constat ex illis quae supra ad vers. 5 dicta sunt de Abrahamo {1}, ubi haec, `Non vocabitur 
amplius nomine tuo Abram, et erit nomen tuum Abraham,' per quae similiter significatum, quod exuet humanum, (c)ac induet Divinum, de quibus n. 2009; littera enim `H' quae adjecta est nomini Sarah, 
ex Jehovae nomine desumpta est, ob causam ut Sarah, sicut Abraham, repraesentaret Divinum Domini; nempe Divinum conjugium Boni cum Vero in Domino, `Abraham' Divinum Bonum, et `Sarah' Divinum Verum; 
[2] ex quo nasceretur Divinum Rationale quod est `Isacus.'  Divinum Bonum quod est amor, et respective ad universum genus humanum est misericordia, fuit Internum Domini, hoc est, Jehovah, Qui ipsum 
Bonum est; hoc repraesentatur per `Abrahamum'; verum quod conjungendum Divino Bono, repraesentatum est per `Sarai,' quod cum etiam Divinum factum, repraesentatur per `Sarah,' nam Dominus ad unionem 
cum Jehovah successive progressus est, ut supra passim dictum; verum nondum Divinum per `Sarai' repraesentatum, erat cum adhuc non ita unitum Bono, ut ex Bono verum; at cum ita unitum Bono ut ex Bono 
procederet, tunc fuit Divinum, ac ipsum Verum tunc quoque Bonum quia Boni verum; aliud est verum quod tendit ad bonum, ut uniatur bono, et aliud [est,] quod unitum bono ita ut procedat prorsus a bono; 
verum quod tendit ad bonum, trahit adhuc aliquid ab humano; at quod prorsus unitum bono, hoc exuit omne quod (o)est humanum et induit Divinum: [3] hoc per simile, ut prius, apud hominem illustrari potest; 
cum regeneratur homo, hoc est, cum conjungendus Domino, ad conjunctionem per verum, hoc est, per vera fidei procedit, nemo enim regenerari potest nisi per cognitiones fidei, quae sunt vera per quae 
ad conjunctionem procedit; his Dominus obviam it per bonum, hoc est, per charitatem, et illam inaptat cognitionibus fidei, hoc est, veris ejus; omnia enim vera sunt vasa recipientia boni, quare quo 
genuina magis sunt vera et quo plus multiplicantur, eo plus bono datur copia recipiendi illa ut vasa, redigendique illa in ordinem, et se demum manifestandi, usque demum ut non appareant vera, nisi 
quantum per illa translucet bonum, ita verum fit caeleste spirituale; [et] quia in bono quod solius est charitatis, Dominus solum est praesens, ita homo conjungitur Domino et donatur per bonum, hoc est, 
per charitatem conscientia, ex qua dein cogitat verum {2} et facit rectum `, sed haec secundum vera et recta, quibus bonum seu charitas inaptatur. 	@1 Abramo.$ 	@2 ip suum$ </p>
