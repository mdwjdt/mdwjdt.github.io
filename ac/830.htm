<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第830节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>830.</strong>有些人以狡猾的手段欺骗人，他们和颜悦色的背后隐藏着恶毒的诡计，从而迷惑人们，目的是毁灭他们。其地狱要比其他任何人的都要恐怖，事实上比杀人犯的地狱还要恐怖。在他们自己看来，他们似乎生活在蛇群中。其欺骗性越险恶，包围并折磨他们的蛇就越可怕、恶毒，数量也越多。他们只知道它们是蛇，因为他们所忍受的疼痛和折磨正如蛇所造成的。几乎没人会相信这一点，然而这是千真万确的。他们就是那些预谋欺骗，并从中感受其生活的快乐之人。对骗子的惩罚各式各样，皆取决于欺骗的性质。一般来说，这种人无法被社群容忍，而是被逐出去。因为一个精灵无论想什么，旁边的人立刻就能知道和察觉。因此，他们会觉察有没有欺骗的东西，是哪类欺骗。所以，他们最终从社群中被逐出，孤零零地坐着。这时，他们看似有一张很宽的脸，有别人的四、五张脸那么宽，戴着一顶稻草制成的宽大白帽。由于他们在那里居于痛苦中，故而是死亡的形像。还有一些本质上是骗子的其他人，其假面容背后的预谋行为不是那么多，也没有那么偷偷摸摸。他们会立刻被识别出来，其思维也能被清楚觉察到。他们甚至以此夸口，仿佛他们很精明。其地狱有所不同。蒙主慈悲，有关骗子们的更多情况，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]830.</strong> Some people fool others with great subtlety and craft, presenting a pleasant face and pleasant speech but inwardly concealing poisonous deceit. In this way they captivate others for the purpose of destroying them. Their hell is more forbidding than others' hells, more forbidding even than the one murderers are in. They seem to themselves to live among snakes, and the more hurtful their plots had been, the more dreadful, poisonous, and numerous appear the snakes that surround and torture them. They have no idea that these are not snakes, the pain and torment they feel being the same. Few will believe this, perhaps, and yet it is true.<br />These are people who premeditate the frauds they practice, and find the highest pleasure of their life in them.<br />Dissemblers are chastised in several different ways, according to the nature of their deceit. In general, the communities banish such people rather than tolerate them. Whatever a spirit thinks, those nearby immediately know and perceive it, so they can tell if any duplicity is at work and what kind of duplicity it is. In consequence, after being driven away from society, they end up sitting alone. They then appear to have a broad face, equal in width to four or five others' faces. They wear a wide, white straw hat{*1} and sit like images of death, racked with pain.<br />There are others who by nature are given to deception, so that they do not act from forethought or under cover of a false appearance. They are recognized instantly, and their thinking is perceived plainly. They even boast about their dishonesty, as if wanting to appear clever. These people do not have the same kind of hell. But more on charlatans later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_830/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947" target=_top>947</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_830/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957" target=_top>957-960</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_830/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1271" target=_top>1271</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_830/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6197" target=_top>6197</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here is based on reading "straw hat" (pileo canneo), as in Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_830/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2498" target=_top>2498</a> and Elliott's translation (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999), for the first Latin edition's "fleshy hat" (pileo carneo).

They who beguile men by subtle deceit, wearing a pleasant face and manner of speech, but concealing envenomed guile within, and thus captivating men for the purpose of ruining them, are in a hell more 
dreadful than the hells of others, even more dreadful than the hell of murderers. They seem to themselves to live among serpents; and the more pernicious their deceit has been, the more dreadful and 
venomous and the more numerous the serpents appear which surround and torment them. They know not but that they are serpents; they feel similar pains and similar torments. Few perhaps will believe this, 
but yet it is true. These are they who practice deceit with premeditation, and feel therein the delight of their life. The punishments of the deceitful are various, each according to the nature of 
the deceit. In general such persons are not tolerated in societies, but are expelled; for whatever a spirit thinks, they who are near instantly know and perceive; thus they perceive whether there is 
anything of deceit, and what sort of deceit. Therefore, being at length expelled from societies, they sit in solitude; and they then appear with a broad face, the breadth equaling that of four or five 
faces of others, and with a broad fleshy cap turning white, sitting as images of death, in torment. There are others who are deceitful by nature, thus not so much from premeditation, and not clandestinely 
under a feigned countenance. They are known at once, and their thought is plainly perceived. They even boast of it, as if they would appear shrewd. These have not such a hell. But, by the Divine 
mercy of the Lord, more will be said about the deceitful hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 830</b></p><p><b>830.</b>
The hell of those who mislead people by cunning deception - putting on a smile and a pleasant tone of voice while concealing venomous deceit within, and in this way getting hold of people with the intent 
of destroying them - is more horrible than anybody else's, more horrible in fact than the murderers' hell. To themselves they seem to be living among snakes; and the more treacherous their deceits 
have been, the more dreadful and venomous the snakes appear to be, and the more there are which surround and torment them. Nor do they know of them as anything other than snakes, for the pains and agony 
they endure are just like those caused by snakes. Few will perhaps believe this, but it is nevertheless the truth. These are people who premeditate the deceits they practise and feel the joy of life 
in doing so. Punishments for deceivers are various, depending on the nature of the deceit. In general they are not tolerated in communities but are expelled from them, for whatever a spirit is thinking 
those around him know and perceive in an instant. They accordingly know and perceive whether there is any deceit in him, and the nature of it. This is why deceivers are ultimately cast out of communities 
and dwell all alone. Their face at such times has a broad look, stretched to a width four or five times that of other people's faces, with a broad whitish hat made of straw. As they dwell there 
in their agony they are semblances of death. There are others who by nature are deceivers, and so act less premeditatedly and less surreptitiously behind a false countenance. They are recognized immediately 
and their thinking is perceived clearly. They even boast about it as though they wished to seem clever. Theirs is not the same kind of hell. But more about deceivers will in the Lord's Divine 
mercy be presented later on. </p>

</p><b>830.</b>
Qui acuto dolo decipiunt homines, faciem et loquelam suavem praeferendo, at intus venenatos dolos recondendo, et sic captando homines fine perdendi, illorum infernum est atrocius quam aliorum, et quidem 
atrocius inferno homicidarum; inter serpentes videntur sibi vivere; et quo perniciosiores eorum doli fuerunt, eo serpentes apparent diriores et venenatiores et eo plures qui eos circumdant et cruciant; 
non aliter sciunt quam quod serpentes sint; similes dolores et similes cruciatus sentiunt; quod forte pauci credituri, sed usque est verum: sunt ii qui ex praemeditato dolos exercent et in eo jucunditatem 
vitae sentiunt.  Dolosorum poenae sunt diversae, cujusvis secundum doli naturam; in genere in societatibus non tolerantur, sed expelluntur; quicquid enim cogitat spiritus, vicini ilico sciunt 
et percipiunt, ita si quid doli, et qualis dolus; quare tandem e societatibus expulsi sedent solitarii, et apparent tunc lata facie, cujus latitudo aequat quatuor vel quinque facies aliorum, cum lato 
pileo carneo, albescente, sedentes ut mortis simulacra in cruciatu.  Sunt alii qui natura dolosi sunt, ita non ex praemeditato et non clandestine sub alio vultu, ii statim cognoscuntur et eorum cogitatio 
percipitur manifeste; et quoque jactant se de eo, sicut quod velint videri callidi; hi non tale infernum habent: sed plura de dolosis, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
