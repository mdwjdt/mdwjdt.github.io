<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2066节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2066.</strong>“也要从她赐一个儿子给你”表理性。这从“儿子”的含义清楚可知，“儿子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>节）。由于理性的全部都来源于真理，故此处“儿子”表理性。主的第一理性由婢女夏甲所生的以实玛利来代表和表示。这在前面有所论述（16章）。此处所论述的主题是第二理性，由撒拉要生的以撒来代表和表示。由以实玛利所代表的第一理性是随后被逐出家门的理性，而由以撒所代表的第二理性是留在家里的那个理性，因为它是神性。关于该理性，蒙主怜悯，我们会在下一章论述以撒的地方予以说明。</p>

And I will give thee a son from her also. That this signifies the rational, is evident from the signification of a "son," as being truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147); and as all that is rational begins 
from truth, the rational is here signified by a "son." The Lord's first rational was represented and signified by Ishmael, born of Hagar the handmaid treated of in the preceding chapter (16). The second 
rational, treated of here, is represented and signified by Isaac who was to be born from Sarah. The former, that is, the rational represented by Ishmael, was the rational that was afterwards expelled 
from the house; but this second rational, represented by Isaac, is that which remained in the house, because it was Divine. But concerning this rational, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall speak 
in the following chapter, where Isaac is treated of.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2066</b></p><p><b>2066.</b>
'And I will also give you a son by her' means the Rational. This is clear from the meaning of 'a son' as truth, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>. And because the whole of the rational originates in 
truth, 'a son' here means the rational. The Lord's first rational was represented and meant by Ishmael, born from the servant-girl Hagar. This was dealt with previously in Chapter <a href="16.htm">16</a>. The second Rational, 
which is the subject here, is represented and meant by Isaac who was to be born from Sarah. The former, that represented by Ishmael, was the rational that was subsequently cast out of the house, 
but this latter Rational, which is represented by Isaac, is the one that remained in the house, because it was Divine. This rational is in the Lord's Divine mercy to be described in the next chapter where 
Isaac is the subject. </p>

</p><b>2066.</b>
`Et etiam dabo ex illa tibi filium': quod significet Rationale, constat ex significatione `filii' quod sit verum, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 1147; et quia omne rationale a vero incohat, hic per `filium' 
significatur rationale: primum rationale Domini repraesentatum et significatum est per `Ismaelem, natum ex Hagare ancilla,' de quo in cap. praec. xvi; alterum Rationale de quo hic agitur, repraesentatur 
et significatur per `Isacum qui nasceretur ex Sarah'; illud, nempe quod repraesentatum per `Ismaelem,' fuit rationale quod domo postea expulsum est; hoc autem Rationale quod repraesentatur per `Isacum,' 
est quod domo mansit quia Divinum: sed de hoc rationali in sequente capite, ubi de Isaco, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicendum. </p>
