<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6157节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6157.</strong>“四分可以归你们”表那些尚未变成余留的事物。这从“四分”的含义清楚可知，当论及表示余留的“五分之一”（参看<a href="6156.htm">6156</a>节）被拿走后的剩余时，“四分”是指尚未变成余留的事物。“四”与“二”所表相同，即表示成双成对并结合在一起的事物（<a href="1686.htm">1686</a>节），如良善与真理就是成双成对的，并结合在一起。当这些事物尚未变成余留时，它们在此由“四分”来表示。因为良善与真理在被转交给一个人之前，不会变成余留；并且只有当人出于情感在自由中接受它们时，它们才首次被转交给他。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6157</b></p><p><b>6157.</b>
And four parts shall be for you. That this signifies those things which were not yet remains, is evident from the signification of "four parts," when said of the residue when a fifth part, by which are 
signified remains, has been taken away (see n. 6156), as being the things which are not yet remains. By "four" is signified the like as by "two," namely, things which are pairs and which are conjoined 
together (n. 1686), as are good and truth. When these have not as yet become remains, they are here signified by "four parts." For goods and truths do not become remains until they are being appropriated 
to man, and they are for the first time being appropriated to man when they are received from affection in freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6157</b></p><p><b>6157.</b>
'And four portions shall be yours' means those things which have not yet become remnants. This is clear from the meaning of 'four portions' - when this describes what is left over from 'a fifth', which 
means, <a href="6156.htm">6156</a> - as things which are not yet remnants. 'Four' has a similar meaning to two, namely pairs and things joined together, <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>, as goodness and truth are a pair and joined together. When these 
have not yet become remnants is what is meant here by 'four portions'. For forms of good and truths do not become remnants until they are made over to a person; and they are made over to him when 
they are accepted by him with affection and in freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6157</b>
</p><b>6157.</b>
`Et quatuor partes {1}erit vobis':  quod significet illa quae nondum reliquiae, constat ex significatione `quatuor partium' cum dicuntur de residuis a quinta parte per quam significantur reliquiae, 
n. 6156, quod sint illa quae nondum reliquiae.  Per `quatuor' significatur simile quod per duo, nempe quae paria sunt et quae conjuncta, n. 1686, sicut sunt bonum et verum; haec cum nondum facta reliquiae, 
significantur hic per quatuor partes; bona enim et vera non fiunt reliquiae priusquam appropriantur homini, et appropriantur homini tunc primum cum recipiuntur ex affectione in libero. </p>
