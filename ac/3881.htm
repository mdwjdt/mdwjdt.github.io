<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3881节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3881.</strong>“因此给他起名叫犹大”表它的根本性质。这从“名”和“起名”的含义清楚可知，“名”和“起名”是指根本性质（<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）。这种性质本身就包含在利亚所说“这次我要称谢耶和华”这句话的内义中，如刚才所述（<a href="3880.htm">3880</a>节）。也就是说，这句话在至高意义表示主和祂爱的神性；在内在意义上表示主和主的属天国度；在外层意义上表示取自属天教会所拥有的圣言的教义。至今几乎没有人知道在圣言中，凡提及“犹大”的地方，它都表示这些事物。原因在于，圣言的历史被视为纯粹的历史，而预言，除了从中得出教义信条的外，则属于诸如被遗忘的那类事物。人们不相信这些历史和预言有灵义在里面，因为如今人们不知道何为圣言的灵义，甚至不知道何为属灵之物。其主要原因是，人们过的是属世的生活，而属世的生活具有这样的性质：当人们视它为目的，或爱它高于一切时，它会抹掉属灵的知识和信仰，以至于当提及属灵的生活和属灵的意义时，这些就像是某种并非实际存在的事物，或某种令人不快和消沉的东西，引起人们的反感，因为它与属世的生活不一致。这就是如今人类的境况，人们不明白，也不愿明白，圣言所提及的名字除了表示这些名字所指的民族、人民、人物、地区、城市、大山、河流之外还表示别的什么。然而，名字在灵义上表示真实事物。<br />“犹大”在内在意义上表示主的属天教会；在普遍意义上表示祂的属天国度；在至高意义上表示主自己。这一点从旧约中提及“犹大”的许多经文可以看出来，如以下经文，摩西五经：<br />你是犹大；你弟兄们必赞美你；你手必掐住你仇敌的颈项；你父亲的儿子们必向你下拜。犹大是个小狮子；我儿啊，你猎了食便上去。他蹲伏，卧如狮子，蹲如老狮子，谁敢叫醒他？权杖必不离犹大，立法者不离他两脚之间，直等细罗来到，万民都必归顺他。犹大把驴驹拴在葡萄树上，把母驴的崽子拴在美好的葡萄树上。他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。他的眼睛必因酒红润；他的牙齿必因奶白亮。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.8.htm">49:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.12.htm">12</a>）<br />若不通过内义，没有人明白雅各（那时叫以色列）关于犹大的这段预言，甚至一个词也不明白。他不可能知道“他弟兄们必赞美他”、“他父亲的儿子们必向他下拜”、“他是个小狮子，猎了食便上去。他蹲伏，卧、蹲如狮子” 是什么意思。他也不可能知道“细罗”、“把驴驹拴在葡萄树上，把母驴的崽子拴在美好的葡萄树上”、“在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂”、“他的眼睛必因酒红润；他的牙齿必因奶白亮”是什么意思。如前所述，若不通过内义，这些表述绝无可能为任何人所理解。然而，它们（即每句话）全都表示主国度的属天之物，以及神性事物。这些话还预言，主的属天国度和至高意义上的主自己要由犹大来代表。蒙主的神圣怜悯，雅各宣称的这些事等到解释这一章时再予以说明。<br />这种情形在圣言中提及犹大的其它部分，尤其先知书也是一样，如以西结书：<br />人子啊，你要取一根木杖，在其上写犹大和他的同伴以色列人；又取一根木杖，在其上写为约瑟，就是以法莲的木杖，又为他的同伴以色列全家；你要使这两根木杖接连为一，在你手中成为一根。我要使他们在那地，在以色列山上成为一个民族，有一王作他们众人的王。我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，他们众人只有一个牧人；他们必遵行我的典章，谨守实行我的律例。他们必住在我赐给我仆人雅各的地上，就是你们列祖所住之地；他们和他们的子孙，并子孙的子孙，都永远住在那里；我的仆人大卫必作他们的君王，直到永远。并且我要与他们立平安的约，必给他们作永约。我要安顿他们，使他们的人数增多，又在他们中间设立我的圣所，直到永远。我的居所必与他们同在；我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.15.htm">37:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.28.htm">28</a>）<br />凡以为此处的“犹大”是指犹大，“以色列”是指以色列，“约瑟”是指约瑟，“以法莲”是指以法莲，“大卫”是指大卫的人，会以为所有这些事会照着字义所描述的那样实际发生。也就是说，他以为以色列会再次与犹大，以及以法莲支派联合；还有，大卫作为君王统治他们，他们以这种方式住在赐给雅各的那地，直到永远；到那时，永约将与他们建立，圣所要在他们中间，直到永远。而事实上，就内义而言，这段经文根本不是在说犹太民族，全都涉及“犹大”所表示的主的属天国度、“以色列”所表示的主的属灵国度和“大卫”所表示的主自己。由此非常明显地看出，名字并非用来表示实际的人物，而是用来表示属天和神性的事物。<br />以下这些话也一样，撒迦利亚书：<br />必有许多人民和众多民族来寻求万军之耶和华。在那些日子，必有十个人从说各样语言的诸族出来抓住；他们要抓住一个犹大人的衣襟说，我们要与你们同去，因为我们听见神与你们同在了。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.22.htm">8:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.23.htm">23</a>）<br />那些照字面理解这些话的人会说（如犹太民族至今仍相信的），这个预言还没有实现，但未来会应验；因此，犹太人会回到迦南地，来自各个民族和说各种语言的许多人会追随他们，抓住犹大人的衣襟，祈求被允许跟随他们；那时，神，也就是基督徒称之为主的弥赛亚会与他们同在，他们必归向祂。如果“犹大人”是指犹大人，那么这会是这些话的含义。而事实上，就内义而言，此处论述的主题是外邦人当中的一个新的属灵教会，“犹大人”表示出自对主之爱的得救之信。<br />“犹大人”并非表示犹大人，如前所述，在内义上表示主的属天国度。建立犹大或犹太人当中的教会就代表主的属天国度，这一点从以下经文也能清楚看出来：<br />主必向列族竖立大旗，召集以色列被赶散的人，又从地的四角聚集分散的犹大人。那时，以法莲的嫉妒必消散，犹大的仇敌必被剪除；以法莲必不嫉妒犹大，犹大也不扰害以法莲。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.12.htm">11:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.13.htm">13</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，看哪，日子将到，我要为大卫兴起公义的苗裔；祂必掌王权，繁荣昌盛，在地上施行公平和公义。在祂的日子，犹大必得救，以色列也安然居住；这就是他们所称祂的名，就是耶和华我们的义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />那时，你们就知道我是耶和华你们的神，且又住在锡安我的圣山；耶路撒冷必成为圣。到那日，大山要滴甜酒，小山要流奶子，犹大溪河都有水流；必有泉源从耶和华的殿中流出来，浇灌什亭的溪谷。犹大必存到永远，耶路撒冷必存到代代。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.17.htm">3:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.20.htm">20</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />到那日，我必以惊惶击打一切马匹，以颠狂击打骑马的；我必开眼看顾犹大家，击打万民一切的马匹，使它们瞎眼。犹大的族长必心里说，我要倚靠万军之耶和华他们的神坚固耶路撒冷的居民。那日，我必使犹大的族长如火盆在木柴中，又如火把在禾捆里。他们必左右烧灭四围的列民。耶路撒冷人必仍住本处，就是耶路撒冷。耶和华必先拯救犹大的帐棚，免得大卫家的荣耀和耶路撒冷居民的荣耀胜过犹大。那日，耶和华必保护耶路撒冷的居民，大卫的家必如神，如行在他们前面之耶和华的使者。我必将恩慈之灵浇灌大卫家和耶路撒冷的居民。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.4.htm">12:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是主的属天国度，在那里，真理必不向良善掌权，而是服从良善。真理由“大卫家和耶路撒冷的居民”来表示，良善由“犹大”来表示。由此明显可知为何经上先说“免得大卫家的荣耀和耶路撒冷居民的荣耀胜过犹大”，然后又说“大卫的家必如神，如耶和华的使者，并将恩慈之灵浇灌大卫家和耶路撒冷的居民”。因为这就是真理服从良善，或信服从爱时的状态。“被惊惶击打的马匹，万民瞎眼的马匹”表示自我聪明（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>节）。<br /><br />当那日，马的铃铛上要刻上归耶和华为圣；耶和华殿内的锅必如祭坛前的碗一样；凡耶路撒冷和犹大的锅，都必归万军之耶和华为圣。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.20.htm">14:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这描述的是主的国度。玛拉基书：<br />看哪，我要差遣我的使者在我前面预备道路；你们所寻求的主，并立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的，必忽然进入祂的殿；看哪，祂来了，可祂来的日子，谁受得了呢？那时，犹大和耶路撒冷所献的供物，必蒙耶和华悦纳，仿佛古时之日、往昔之年。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这明显论述的是主的到来。意思是，那时，犹大和耶路撒冷所献的供物并不蒙悦纳，蒙悦纳的是出自爱的敬拜，就是“犹大的供物”，和出自植根于爱之信的敬拜，也就是“耶路撒冷的供物”。<br />耶利米书：<br />万军之耶和华如此说，我使被掳之人归回的时候，他们在犹大地和其中的城邑必再说这话；公义的居所啊，圣山哪，愿耶和华赐福给你！犹大及其一切城邑要一同住在其中。耶和华说，看哪，日子将到，我要把人的种和牲畜的种，播种在以色列家和犹大家。看哪，日子将到，我要与以色列家和犹大家另立新约；不像我与他们的祖先所立的约。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.23.htm">31:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.31.htm">31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.32.htm">32</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />主拣选犹大支派，祂所喜爱的锡安山；建造祂的圣所，好像高峰，又像祂所建立的永存之地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.68.htm">78:68</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.69.htm">69</a>）<br />从这些，以及此处没有引用的许多其它经文可以看出在圣言中，“犹大”表示什么；它不是指犹太民族，因为这个民族离成为属天教会，或主的属天国度差的太远了；就对主之爱和对邻之仁，以及信而言，该民族是所有民族中最坏的，自他们的始祖，就是雅各的儿子们直到今天都是如此。尽管如此，这百姓却能代表主国度的属天和属灵之物（参看<a href="3479.htm">3479</a>-<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>节）。因为在代表中，不要关注代表的这个人，而只关注他所代表的事物（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>，<a href="1361.htm">1361</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节）。<br />但他们不再持守耶和华或主所规定的宗教仪式，而是背离它们转向偶像崇拜时，就不再代表属天和属灵之物，而代表反面，也就是地狱和魔鬼之物，就像主在约翰福音所说的那样：<br />你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们偏要行；他从起初是杀人的，不守真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.44.htm">8:44</a>）<br />这就是“犹大”在反面意义上的意思。这一点从以下经文可以看出来，以赛亚书：<br />耶路撒冷跌跌撞撞，犹大倾倒，因为他们的舌头和行为与耶和华作对，惹了祂荣光的眼目。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.8.htm">3:8</a>）<br />玛拉基书：<br />犹大人行事诡诈，并且在以色列和耶路撒冷中行一件可憎的事；犹大人亵渎了耶和华的圣洁，因为他喜爱并娶了外邦神的女子。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.11.htm">2:11</a>）<br />另外，还有下列经文：以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.1.htm">3:1</a>等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.7.htm">8:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.8.htm">8</a>），耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.28.htm">2:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.7.htm">3:7</a>-<a

Therefore she called his name Judah. That this signifies his quality, is evident from the signification of "name," and of "calling a name," as being quality (n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 
3421). The quality itself is contained in the internal sense of the words that Leah spoke: "This time I will confess Jehovah," concerning which just above (n. 3880), namely, that in the supreme sense 
it is the Lord and the Divine of His love; in the internal sense, the Word and also the Lord's celestial kingdom; and in the exterior sense, the doctrine from the Word which is of the celestial church. 
That these things are signified in the Word by "Judah," wherever the name occurs, scarcely anyone as yet knows, because the histories of the Word are believed to be merely historical; and the prophecies 
to be of the things that have been consigned to oblivion, except some from which doctrinal tenets may be drawn. That there is a spiritual sense in them is not believed, because at this day it is 
not known what the spiritual sense of the Word is, nor even what that which is spiritual is. The principal reason of this is that men live a natural life, and the natural life is such that when it is 
regarded as the end, or is loved above all other things, it obliterates both knowledges and faith; insomuch that when spiritual life and a spiritual sense are mentioned, it is as though a kind of nonentity 
were spoken of, or something unpleasant and sad, that excites loathing, because it is in disagreement with the natural life. As this is now the state of the human race, they do not apprehend, 
nor are they willing to apprehend that anything else is meant by the names in the Word than the things themselves which are named; such as nations, peoples, persons, countries, cities, mountains, rivers; 
when yet in the spiritual sense names signify actual things. [2] That in the internal sense "Judah" signifies the Lord's celestial church; in the universal sense His celestial kingdom; and in the 
supreme sense the Lord Himself, may be seen from many passages in the Old Testament where "Judah" is mentioned; as from the following. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou art Judah; thy brethren shall praise thee; 
thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father's sons shall bow down themselves to thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey my son thou art gone up; he stooped down, he couched as a lion, 
and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall be the gathering together of the peoples. 
Binding his ass's foal unto the vine, and the son of his she-ass unto the choice vine, he shall wash his garment in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes. his eyes are red with wine, and 
his teeth white with milk (Gen. 49:8-12). [3] This prophetic utterance of Jacob (then Israel) concerning Judah, cannot be understood by anyone-not even a single word of it-except from the internal 
sense; as for instance what is meant by "his brethren praising him"; and by "his father's sons bowing down themselves to him"; by "his going up from the prey like a lion's whelp, and stooping and couching 
as a lion"; or what by "Shiloh"; by "binding his ass's foal to a vine, and the son of his she-ass to a choice vine"; by "washing his garment in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes"; by 
"his eyes being red with wine, and his teeth white with milk." As before said these expressions cannot possibly be understood by anyone except from the internal sense, when yet all and each of them signify 
celestial things of the Lord's kingdom, and Divine things; and thereby it is predicted that the Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, should be represented by Judah. 
But concerning all these expressions, of the Lord's Divine mercy more shall be said in the explication of that chapter. [4] The case is the same in other parts of the Word, especially in the Prophets, 
where mention is made of Judah; as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his companions; and take another stick, and write 
upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel his companions; and join them for thee one to another into one stick, and they shall become one in My hand. I will make them 
one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all. My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd; and they shall walk in My 
judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; they and their sons shall dwell upon it, and their 
sons' sons even forever; and My servant David shall be their prince forever. And I will establish with them a covenant of peace it shall be to them an everlasting covenant. I will place them and multiply 
them, and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore. Thus shall My habitation be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people (Ezek. 37:15-28).      Whoever supposes 
that by "Judah" is here meant Judah; by "Israel," Israel; by "Joseph," Joseph; by "Ephraim," Ephraim; and by "David," David; will believe that all these things are to come to pass as they are described 
in the sense of the letter-that Israel will be again consociated with Judah, as well as the tribe of Ephraim; likewise that David will rule over them, and that they will thus dwell upon the land 
given unto Jacob forever; and that an everlasting covenant will in this case be established with them, and a sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore; when in the internal sense the Jewish nation 
is not meant at all; but the Lord's celestial kingdom which is "Judah," and His spiritual kingdom which is "Israel," and the Lord Himself who is "David." From this it is very plain that by names are 
not meant persons, but things celestial and Divine. [5] The case is similar in regard to the following words in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Many peoples and numerous nations shall come to seek Jehovah Zebaoth. 
In those days ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of a man of Judah, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you 
(Zech. 8:22-23). They who apprehend these words according to the letter will say (as the Jewish nation to this day believes) that as this prophecy has not yet been fulfilled, it will be; and therefore 
that the Jews will return to the land of Canaan, and many will follow them out of all the languages of the nations, and will lay hold of the skirt of a man of Judah, and will pray for leave to follow 
them; and that then God (namely, the Messiah, whom Christians call the Lord) will be with them, to whom they must first be converted. This would be the promise of the words if by a "man of Judah" there 
were meant a Jew. But the subject here treated of in the internal sense is a new spiritual church among the Gentiles; and by a "man of Judah" is signified the saving faith which comes from love to 
the Lord. [6] That by "Judah" is not meant Judah; but, as already said, in the internal sense the Lord's celestial kingdom, which was represented in the church instituted with Judah or the Jews, may 
also be clearly seen from the following passages: </p>
<p>     The Lord shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the 
four wings of the earth. Then shall the envy of Ephraim depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim (Isa. 11:12-13). And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise up unto David a righteous branch, who shall reign as a king, and shall prosper, and shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. 
In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell securely; and this is His name whereby they shall call Him, Jehovah our Righteousness (Jer. 23:5, 6). And in Joel: </p>
<p>     Then ye shall know 
that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion, the mountain of My holiness; and Jerusalem shall be holiness. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop new wine, and the hills 
shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the stream of Shittim. Judah shall abide forever, 
and Jerusalem to generation and generation (Joel 3:17-18, 20). [7] And in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     In that day I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness; and I will open Mine 
eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness. And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, I will strengthen to myself the inhabitants of Jerusalem in 
Jehovah Zebaoth their God. In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a hearth of fire in the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the peoples round about on 
the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall yet again be inhabited in her own place, even in Jerusalem; and Jehovah shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David, 
and the glory of the inhabitant of Jerusalem, may not lift itself up above Judah. In that day will Jehovah defend the inhabitant of Jerusalem. And the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of 
Jehovah before them. And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitant of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace (Zech. 12:4-10). The subject here treated of is the Lord's celestial kingdom-that 
truth should not have dominion therein over good, but that truth should be subordinate to good. Truth is signified by the "house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;" and good by "Judah." From 
this it is manifest why it is first said that "the glory of the house of David, and the glory of the inhabitant of Jerusalem, may not lift itself up above Judah;" and next, that "the house of David 
shall be as God, and as the angel of Jehovah, and that the spirit of grace shall be poured upon it, and upon the inhabitant of Jerusalem;" for such is the state when truth is subordinate to good, or faith 
to love. The "horse which shall be smitten with astonishment, and the horse of the peoples with blindness" signifies self-intelligence (n. 2761-2762, 3217). [8] Again: </p>
<p>     In that day shall there 
be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness to Jehovah; and the pots in the house of Jehovah shall be like the bowls before the altar; and every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to Jehovah 
Zebaoth (Zech. 14:20-21); </p>
<p>     describing the Lord's kingdom. In Malachi: </p>
<p>     Behold I send My angel who shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His 
temple, even the Angel of the covenant whom ye desire; behold He cometh but who may abide the day of His coming? Then shall the meat-offering of Judah and of Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in 
the days of old, and as in former years (Mal. 3:1-2, 4); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is manifestly the Lord's advent. It is known that the meat-offering of Judah and Jerusalem was not then pleasant; 
but that worship from love was pleasant, which is the "meat-offering of Judah;" and worship from faith derived from love, which is the "meat-offering of Jerusalem."  [9] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith 
Jehovah Zebaoth, Yet again shall they say this word in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain 
of holiness. And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together. Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of 
beast. Behold the days come that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers (Jer. 31:23-24, 27, 31-32). And 
in David: </p>
<p>     The Lord hath chosen the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion that He loved; and hath built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth hath He founded it forever (Ps. 78:68, 69). [10] 
From these and many other passages here omitted, it may be seen what is signified in the Word by "Judah;" and that it is not the Jewish nation, because this was very far from being a celestial 
church, or the Lord's celestial kingdom; being the worst of all nations in regard to love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, and also in regard to faith; and this from the days of their first 
fathers, the sons of Jacob, down to the present time. (That such persons were nevertheless capable of representing the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above, n. 3479-3481, 
because in representations the person is not reflected upon, but only the thing that is represented, n. 665, 1097, 1361, 3147, 3670.) [11] But when they did not remain in the rituals ordained 
by Jehovah or the Lord, but turned away from them to idolatries, they then no longer represented celestial and spiritual things, but the opposite, that is, infernal and diabolical things-according 
to the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will to do; he was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth (John 8:44). That this 
is signified by "Judah" in the opposite sense, may be seen from the following words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jerusalem hath stumbled, and Judah is fallen, because their tongue and their works are against Jehovah 
to rebel against the eyes of His glory (Isa. 3:8). And in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Judah hath dealt treacherously, and abomination hath been wrought in Israel and in Jerusalem; and Judah hath profaned the 
holiness of Jehovah, because he hath loved and betrothed to himself the daughter of a strange god (Mal. 2:11); </p>
<p>and also in the following passages: Isa. 3:1, and following verses; 8:7, 8; Jer. 2:28; 
3:7-11; 9:26; 11:9, 10, 12; 13:9; 14:2; 17:1; 18:12, 13; 19:7; 32:35; 36:31; 44:12, 14, 26, 28; Hosea 5:5; 8:14; Amos 2:4, 5; Zeph. 1:4; and in many other places. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3881</b></p><p><b>3881.</b>
'Therefore she called his name Judah' means the essential nature of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'name' and of 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>,<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>. That nature is contained in the internal sense of these words spoken by Leah - 'This time I will confess Jehovah', dealt with immediately above in <a href="3880.htm">3880</a>. That is to say, in the 
highest sense those words mean the Lord and the Divinity of His Love, in the internal sense the Word and also the Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the more exterior sense doctrine from the Word which 
the celestial Church has. But as yet scarcely anyone knows that these things are meant in the Word when the name Judah is mentioned, the reason being that the historical descriptions of the Word are thought 
to be simply historical descriptions, and the prophetical utterances to belong among such things as have fallen into oblivion, except for some of them from which doctrinal inferences may be drawn 
out. No belief exists that those descriptions and utterances have a spiritual sense within them, because at the present day no knowledge exists of what the spiritual sense is, or indeed of what the 
spiritual is. And the chief reason for this is that the life which people lead is the natural life. This is such that when they have that life as their end in view or it is the only life they desire, 
it blots out both spiritual knowledge and faith - so much so that when spiritual life and a spiritual sense are spoken of, these are like something that does not really exist or else are something unpleasant 
and depressing which, because it does not accord with natural life, they find distasteful. Such being the condition of the human race at the present day it neither understands nor wishes to understand 
by the names mentioned in the Word anything else than the nations, peoples, individual persons, regions, cities, mountains, or rivers, which those names denote. Yet in the spiritual sense names 
mean real things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'Judah' in the internal sense means the Lord's celestial Church, in the universal sense His celestial kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself may be seen from 
many places in the Old Testament where Judah is mentioned, for example, from the following: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You are Judah; your brothers will praise you; your hands will be on the neck of your enemies; 
the sons of your father will bow down to you. A lion's whelp is Judah; from the prey you have gone up, my son. He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like an old lion; who will rouse him up? The 
sceptre will not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh comes; and to him will be the gathering of peoples. Binding his ass's colt to the vine, and the foal of his she-ass 
to a choice vine, he will wash his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes. His eyes are red from wine, and his teeth white from milk. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:8-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:8-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Nobody can know the meaning 
of this prophetical declaration about Judah uttered by Jacob, who by then was Israel - not even one expression used there - except from the internal sense. He cannot know for example what is meant 
by 'his brothers will praise him' and 'his father's sons will bow down to him', or by 'his going up from the prey like a lion's whelp', and 'his crouching and lying down like a lion'. Nor can he know 
what is meant by 'Shiloh', by 'binding his ass's colt to the vine, and the foal of his she-ass to a choice vine', by 'washing his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes', by 'eyes red 
from wine', or by 'teeth white from milk'. As has been stated, these expressions cannot possibly be understood by anyone except from the internal sense, yet all of them - each one - mean celestial 
things belonging to the Lord's kingdom, also things that are Divine. The same words also foretell that the Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself, were to be represented by 
Judah. All these things declared by Jacob will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed in the explanations of the chapter in which they occur. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Similar examples involving the name Judah occur 
elsewhere, especially in the Prophets, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>You son of man, take a stick and write on it, For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions'. And take another stick and write on it, 
For Joseph - the stick of Ephraim and of the whole house of Israel, his companions - and join them together, one to the other into one stick for you, and they will be one in your, hand. I will make 
them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will be king to them all. My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. And they will walk in 
My judgements, and keep My statutes and do them. And they will dwell in the land which I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers dwelt. And they will dwell in it, they and their sons, and their 
sons' sons even for ever. And David My servant will be their prince for ever, and I will make with them a covenant of peace, it will be an eternal covenant with them. I will bless them, and multiply 
them, and I will grant My sanctuary in their midst for evermore. Thus will My dwelling-place be with them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:15-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:15-28</a>. </p>
<p>Anyone who takes Judah, 
Israel, Joseph, Ephraim, and David in this passage to mean those actual people will believe all these things will actually take place as described in the sense of the letter. That is to say, he will 
believe that Israel is going to be reunited with Judah, as well as the tribe of Ephraim; also that David is going to reign as king; that in this manner they are going to dwell in the land given to 
Jacob for ever, and that at that time an eternal covenant will exist with them and the sanctuary will be in the midst of them for ever. But in fact the meaning of this passage has nothing whatever to 
do with that nation but with the Lord's celestial kingdom meant by 'Judah', and His spiritual kingdom meant by 'Israel', and with the Lord Himself meant by 'David'. From this it is quite evident that 
names are not used to mean actual persons but things that are celestial and Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The same is so with the following words in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Many peoples and numerous nations will come to seek 
Jehovah Zebaoth.
<!--in Jerusalem and to placate Jehovah's face. Thus said Jehovah Zebaoth, -->
In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue will take hold; and they will take hold of the hem of a man 
of Judah, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%208:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 8:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Those who take these words literally will say, as the Jewish nation believes still, that being a prophecy 
not yet fulfilled it is going to be fulfilled in the future. These say that they are going to go back to the land of Canaan, that many from every nation and tongue will follow them, and take hold 
of the hem of a man of Judah and plead to be allowed to follow. They say that at that time God - that is to say, the Messiah, whom Christians call the Lord - will be among them, to whom they must first 
be converted. This would be the true implication of these words if 'a man of Judah' were used to mean a man of Judah. But in fact the internal sense at this point deals with a new spiritual Church 
among gentiles, and 'a man of Judah' means saving faith which results from love to the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'Judah' is not used to mean Judah but, as has been stated, means in the internal sense the Lord's 
celestial kingdom which was represented in the Church established among Judah or the Jews, becomes quite clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
When the Lord raises an ensign for the nations 
He will gather the outcasts of Israel, and will assemble the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. Then the envy of Ephraim will depart, and the enemies of Judah will be cut off. 
Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are coming, said Jehovah, when I will raise up for David a righteous branch, who will 
reign as king, and prosper, and execute judgement and righteousness in the land. In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is His name which they will call Him, Jehovah 
our Righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Joel, </p>
<p>Then you will know that I am Jehovah your God, who dwell in Zion, My holy mountain; and Jerusalem will be holy. It will happen on that day, that the 
mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the streams of Judah will flow with water; and a spring will come forth from the house of Jehovah and will water the river of Shittim. 
Judah will abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. Joel <a href="3.htm">3</a> :17, <a href="18.htm">18</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>. </p>

 In Zechariah, </p>

On that day I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. 
And on the house of Judah I will open My eyes, and every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness. And the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts, I will strengthen for myself the inhabitants 
of Jerusalem in Jehovah Zebaoth their God. On that day I will set the leaders of Judah like a hearth of fire in sticks of wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they will devour to the right 
and to the left all the peoples round about, and Jerusalem will yet again be inhabited in her own place, in Jerusalem. And Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house 
of David, and the glory of the inhabitant of Jerusalem, may not exalt itself over Judah. On that day Jehovah will protect the inhabitant of Jerusalem, and the house of David will be like God, like the 
angel of Jehovah in front of them. And I will pour out over the house of David and over the inhabitant of Jerusalem a spirit of grace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:4-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12:4-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's celestial kingdom, where 
truth should not have dominion over good but ought to be subordinate to it, truth being meant by 'the house of David' and 'the inhabitant of Jerusalem', and good by 'Judah'. From this it is evident 
why first it is said that 'the glory of the house of David, and the glory of the inhabitant of Jerusalem, will not exalt itself over Judah', and after this that 'the house of David will be like God, 
and like the angel of Jehovah', and that 'a spirit of grace will be poured out over it and over the inhabitant of Jerusalem'. For such is the state when truth is subordinate to good or faith to love. 
'The horse which will be struck with panic, and the horse of the peoples with blindness' is self-intelligence, see <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3217.htm">3217</a>. </p>

 In the same prophet, </p>

<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom. In Malachi, </p>

the angel of the covenant in whom you delight. Behold, He is coming. Who can endure the day of His coming? Then the minchah of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to Jehovah, as in the days of old

</blockquote>
<p>This plainly refers to the Coming of the Lord. The meaning is that Judah and Jerusalem's minchah was not, as is well known, acceptable but that worship flowing 
from love, Judah's minchah, and worship flowing from faith rooted in love, Jerusalem's minchah, are acceptable. </p>

<p><b>[10]</b>
 From these places and very many others which have not been mentioned one may see what 
'Judah' means in the Word. They show that 'Judah' does not mean the Jewish nation, for that nation was anything but the celestial Church or the Lord's celestial kingdom; for so far as love to the 
Lord, charity towards the neighbour, and faith; went they were the worst nation of all. This has been so from their earliest forefathers, namely the sons of Jacob, even to the present day. But in spite 
of this such people were able to represent the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, see <a href="3479.htm">3479</a>-<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>. For in representations no attention is paid to the person who represents, only to

 But when they did not adhere to the religious observances commanded by Jehovah or the Lord but deviated from them into acts of idolatry 
they no longer represented those things but such as are contrary to them, namely those of hell and the devil, according to the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
You are from your father the devil, and the 
desires of your father you will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not take a stand on the truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:44</a>

<p>Such is the meaning of 'Judah' in the contrary sense, as becomes clear from

filii patris ejus,' quod `sicut catulus leonis a praeda ascendat,' quod `sicut leo curvet se et cubet,' quid `Shiloh,' quid `ligare ad vitem asininum pullum suum, et ad vitem nobilem filium asinae 
suae,' quid `lavare in vino vestimentum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen,' quid `ruber oculis a vino,' et quid `albus dentibus a lacte'; haec nusquam ab aliquo, ut dictum, capi possunt nisi ex sensu 
interno, cum tamen omnia et singula significent caelestia regni Domini et Divina, et per illa praedicitur quod caeleste regnum Domini, et in supremo sensu Ipse Dominus, per `Jehudam' repraesentaretur, 
de quibus omnibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in explicationibus ad illud caput dicetur {5}.  [4] Similiter se habet alibi, imprimis apud Prophetas, ubi Jehudah nominatur, ut apud Ezechielem,  
    Tu fili hominis, sume tibi lignum unum, et scribe super illo      Jehudae et filiis ejus Israel socii ejus {6}, et sume lignum      unum, et scribe super illo {7} Josepho, lignum Ephraimi 
et      omnis domus Israelis sociorum ejus, et conjunge illa, unum ad      alterum tibi in lignum unum, et erunt in una in manu mea      {8}:... faciam eos in gentem unam in terra in montibus  
    Israelis; et rex unus erit omnibus illis in regem; servus Meus      David rex super eos, et pastor unus erit omnibus illis; et in      judiciis Meis ambulabunt, et statuta Mea custodient, et  
    facient illa, et habitabunt super terra, quam dedi servo Meo      Jacobo, in qua habitarunt patres vestri, et habitabunt super      ea illi et filii eorum, et filii filiorum eorum usque in     
 aeternum, et David servus Meus princeps illis in aeternum, et      pangam illis foedus pacis, foedus aeternitatis erit cum illis; </p>
<p>     dabo illis et multiplicabo illos, et dabo sanctuarium Meum in  
    medio eorum in aeternum; sic erit habitaculum Meum apud illos,      et ero illis in Deum, et illi erunt Mihi in populum, xxxvii      15-28; </p>
<p>qui per `Jehudam' intelligit Judam, per `Israelem' 
Israelem, per `Josephum' Josephum, per `Ephraimum' Ephraimum, et per `Davidem' Davidem, credet quod omnia illa secundum sensum litterae ita futura sint, nempe quod Israel rursus consociabitur cum Jehuda, 
et quoque quod tribus Ephraim, tum quod David regnaturus, et quod habitaturi sic super terra data Jacobo in aeternum, et quod cum illis tunc foedus aeternitatis, et in medio eorum sanctuarium 
in aeternum; cum tamen ne hilum intellectum sit ibi de gente illa, sed de regno caelesti Domini quod est `Jehudah,' et de regno spirituali Ipsius quod est `Israel,' et de Domino Qui est `David'; 
inde manifeste patet quod per nomina non intelligantur personae, sed quod caelestia et Divina.  [5] Similiter se habet cum illis quae apud Zachariam,      Venient populi multi et gentes numerosae 
ad quaerendum Jehovam      Zebaoth. 
<!-- in Hierosolyma, et ad deprecandum facies Jehovae: sic      dixit Jehovah Zebaoth.   -->
In diebus illis apprehendent decem      viri ex omnibus linguis gentium, et apprehendent 
alam viri      Jehudaei, dicendo, Ibimus cum vobis, quia audivimus Deum      vobiscum, viii [22,] 23; </p>
<p>qui secundum litteram haec capiunt, dicent sicut gens illa Judaica adhuc credit, quod 
quia prophetia {9} illa nondum {10} completa est, complebitur, ita quod `redituri in terram Canaanem,' et quod `secuturi illos multi ex omni gente et lingua,' et quod `apprehensuri alam viri Jehudaei, 
et precaturi, ut liceret illos sequi,' et quod apud illos tunc Deus, nempe Messias, quem Christiani dicunt Dominum fore, ad quem prius convertendi; haec fides verborum foret, si per `virum Jehudaeum' 
intelligeretur vir Judaeus; cum tamen ibi in sensu interno agitur de nova Ecclesia spirituali apud gentes, et per `virum Jehudaeum' significatur fides salvans quae est ex amore in Dominum. 
 [6] Quod per `Jehudam' non Jehudah intellectus sit, sed, ut dictum, in sensu interno caeleste regnum Domini, quod in Ecclesia apud Jehudam {11} seu (x)Judaeos instituta repraesentatum fuit, etiam 
manifeste constare potest a sequentibus locis; apud Esaiam,      Dominus cum tollet signum gentibus, congregabit expulsos      Israelis, et dispersa Jehudae colliget a quatuor alis terrae; </p>
<p>     
tunc recedet aemulatio Ephraimi, et hostes Jehudae      exscindentur; Ephraim non aemulabitur cum Jehudah, et Jehudah      non angustabit Ephraimum, xi 12, 13: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,      Ecce dies venientes, 
dictum Jehovae, et excitabo Davidi germen      justum, qui regnabit rex, et prosperabitur, et faciet judicium      et justitiam in terra: in diebus Ipsius salvabitur Jehudah, et      Israel habitabit 
secure; et hoc nomen Ipsius, quod {12}      vocabunt Ipsum, Jehovah Justitia nostra, xxiii 5, 6: </p>
<p>apud Joelem,      Tunc cognoscetis quod Ego Jehovah Deus vester habitans in      Zione, monte 
sanctitatis Meae, et erit {13} Hierosolyma      sanctitas:... et fiet in die illo, stillabunt montes mustum,      et colles fluent lacte, et omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis, et      fons e domo 
Jehovae exibit, et irrigabit flumen shittim;...      Jehudah in aeternum sedebit, et  Hierosolyma in generationem      et generationem, iv [A.V. iii] 17, 18, 20: </p>
<p>[7] apud Zachariam,      In die illo... 
percutiam omnem equum stupore, et equitem ejus      amentia, et super domum Jehudae aperiam oculos Meos, et omnem      equum populorum percutiam caecitate: et dicent duces Jehudae      in corde 
suo, Confirmabo mihi habitatores Hierosolymae in      Jehovah Zebaoth Deo illorum: in die illo ponam duces Jehudae      sicut focum ignis in lignis, et sicut facem ignis in manipulo,      et comedent 
ad dextram et ad sinistram omnes populos      circumcirca; et habitabitur Hierosolyma adhuc sub se in      Hierosolyma; et salvabit Jehovah tentoria Jehudae primum, ut      non extollat se gloria 
domus Davidis, et gloria habitatoris      Hierosolymae super Jehudam: in die illo proteget Jehovah      habitatorem Hierosolymae;... et domus Davidis sicut Deus,      sicut angelus Jehovae coram 
illis:... et effundam super domum      Davidis, et super habitatorem Hierosolymae spiritum gratiae,      xii 4-10; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de regno caelesti Domini, quod ibi non dominaturum verum super bonum, 
sed quod verum subordinatum erit bono; illud nempe verum significatur per `domum Davidis' et per `habitatorem Hierosolymae {14},' et hoc seu bonum per `Jehudam'; inde patet cur primum dicitur quod 
`non extollet se gloria domus Davidis et gloria habitatoris Hierosolymae super Jehudam,' et dein dicitur quod `domus' Davidis erit sicut Deus, et sicut angelus Jehovae,' et quod `super illam et 
super habitatorem Hierosolymae effundetur spiritus gratiae'; talis enim status est, quum bono subordinatum est verum, seu amori fides: `equus qui percutietur stupore, et equus populum caecitate' est 
propria intelligentia, videatur n. 2761, 2762, 3217: </p>
<p>[8] (m)apud eundem,      In die illo erit super tintinnabulis equorum sanctitas      Jehovae; et erunt ollae in domo Jehovae sicut crateres coram  
    altari; et erit omnis olla in Hierosolyma et in Jehudah      sanctitas Jehovae Zebaoth, xiv 20, 21; </p>
<p>ibi de regno Domini agitur(n): apud Malachiam,      Ecce Ego mittens angelum Meum, qui 
parabit viam ante Me, et      subito veniet ad templum Suum Dominus, quem vos quaerentes, et      angelus foederis, quem vos desideratis; ecce venit,... quis      sustinet diem Adventus Ipsius?... 
tunc suavis erit Jehovae      minhah Jehudae et Hierosolymae, juxta dies saeculi et juxta      annos priores, iii 1, 2, 4; </p>
<p>manifeste ibi de Adventu Domini, quod tunc non suavis minhah Jehudae et Hierosolymae 
fuerit,' notum est, sed quod suavis cultus ex amore qui est `minhah Jehudae,' et cultus ex fide inde, qui est `minhah Hierosolymae': [9] apud Jeremiam,      Sic dixit Jehovah Zebaoth,... 
Adhuc dicent verbum hoc in terra      Jehudae, et in urbibus ejus, in convertendo captivitatem      eorum, Benedicat tibi Jehovah, habitaculum justitiae, mons      sanctitatis, et habitabunt in ea 
Jehudah, et omnes urbes ejus      una.... Ecce dies venientes, dictum Jehovae, quibus seminabo      domum Jehudae semine hominis, et semine bestiae.... Ecce dies      venientes, dictum Jehovae, quibus 
pangam cum domo Israelis, et      cum domo Jehudae, foedus novum, non sicut foedus quod pepigi      cum patribus eorum, xxxi 23, 24, 27, 31, 32: </p>
<p>apud Davidem,      Dominus elegit tribum Jehudae, 
montem Zionis, quem amavit, et      aedificavit sicut celsitudines {15} sanctuarium Suum, sicut      terram fundavit in aeternum, Ps. lxxviii 68, 69. [10] Ex his locis et perplurimis aliis, quae 
praetereuntur, constare potest quid per `Jehudam' in Verbo significatur, non quod per illam gens Judaica, haec enim nihil minus fuit quam caelestis Ecclesia seu caeleste regnum Domini, nam {16} 
quoad amorem in Dominum, et charitatem erga proximum, et quoad fidem, fuit gens omnium pessima, et hoc a primis patribus suis, nempe filiis Jacobi, usque ad hodiernum tempus; sed quod usque tales repraesentare potuerint 
caelestia et spiritualia regni Domini, videatur n. 3479-3481; quia in repraesentationibus nihil reflectitur super personam, sed super rem quae repraesentatur, n. 665, 1097 f., 
1361, 3147, 3670.  [11] Cum autem non permanserunt in ritualibus a Jehovah seu Domino mandatis, sed deflexerunt ab illis ad idololatrias, tunc non amplius illa repraesentabant, sed illa quae opposita 
sunt, nempe infernalia et diabolica, secundum Domini verba apud Johannem,      Vos ex patre diabolo estis, et desideria patris vestri vultis      facere; ille homicida erat ab initio, et in veritate 
non      stetit viii 44; </p>
<p>quod tale per `Jehudam' in opposito sensu significetur, constare potest ab his {17} apud Esaiam,      Impegit Hierosolyma, et Jehudah cecidit, quia lingua eorum, et  
    opera eorum contra Jehovam, ad rebellandum oculis gloriae      Ipsius, iii 8: </p>
<p>apud Malachiam,      Perfide egit Jehudah, et abominatio facta est in Israele et in      Hierosolyma, et profanavit 
Jehudah sanctitatem Jehovae, quia      amavit et desponsavit sibi filiam Dei alieni, ii 11; </p>
