<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2663节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2663.</strong>“神对亚伯拉罕说”表主出于神性的直觉。这从“说”在圣言历史部分中的含义清楚可知，前面频繁解释过，“说”是指发觉。由于直觉出自神性，故经上在此说“神对亚伯拉罕说”。这两个名字，即神和亚伯拉罕，都是指主。字义上的历史描述将这些事分成了不同观念，而内义则将它们合为一体。这一事实从以下分析明显可知：就文字的历史意义而言，有两个人（即神与亚伯拉罕）在彼此交谈；但就内义而言，只有一个，就是在神性方面的主。这也表明，在字义上是三位的，在内义上是一位。如父、子、圣灵，他们并非三位神，而是一位神；整个圣三一完全存在于主里面，也就是说，父在祂里面，如祂自己所说的；从父发出的圣灵亦在祂里面，也如祂自己所说的。</p>

God said unto Abraham. That this signifies the Lord's perception from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being to perceive (explained very 
often before); and because it was from the Divine it is said that "God said to Abraham." By both names, "God" and "Abraham," is meant the Lord; which shows that the historic statements which are the 
sense of the letter, divide the ideas; but that the internal sense unites them; for in the historic sense of the letter there are two (namely, God and Abraham) who speak to each other; but in the internal 
sense there is one, namely, the Lord in respect to the Divine. This also shows that they who are three in the sense of the letter are one in the internal sense; as the Father, the Son, and the Holy 
Spirit, who are not three gods, but one; and that all the Trinity is complete in the Lord; namely, that in Him is the Father, as He says; and that from Him is the Holy Spirit, as He also says. </p>

'God said to Abraham' means the Lord's perception from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' in historical parts of the Word as perceiving, often dealt with already. And since the perception 
came from the Divine the words 'God said to Abraham' occur here. Both of these - God and Abraham - are used to mean the Lord. The fact that historical descriptions which belong to the sense of 
the letter divide things into separate ideas, whereas the internal sense makes them one, is evident from the following considerations: In the historical sense of the letter two are described as talking 
to each other, namely God and Abraham; but in the internal sense there is only one, namely the Lord in respect to the Divine. From this it is also evident that those who are three in the sense of 
the letter are one in the internal sense, as it is with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who are not three Gods, but one God; and that the whole Trinity exists complete within the Lord, that is to say, the 
Father is within Him, as He Himself says, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him, as again He Himself says. </p>

`Dixit Deus ad Abrahamum: quod significet perceptionem Domini ex Divino, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit percipere, de qua saepius prius; et quia ex Divino, dicitur quod 
`Deus ad Abrahamum dixit'; per utrumque, tam per Deum quam per Abrahamum, intelligitur Dominus; {1} quod historica quae sunt sensus litterae, dividant ideas, at quod sensus internus uni illas, patet 
ex his; in sensu litterae historico sunt duo, nempe Deus Abrahamus, quae colloquuntur, in sensu interno autem est unus, nempe Dominus quoad Divinum; {2} inde quoque patet quod qui tres sunt in sensu 
litterae, sit unus in sensu interno, sicut Pater, Filius, Spiritus sanctus, qua non tres dii sunt, sed unus, et quod in Domini omne Trinum perfectum sit, nempe in Ipso Pater, ut Ipse dicit, et Ipso 
sanctum spiritus, ut quoque Ipse dicit. 	@1 In A remainder of this [ ] followed 2664 but is marked for insertion here.$ 	@2 i in sensu literae est colloquutio inter eos, in sensu interno est perceptio 
Domini, nam perceptio non aliter quam per colloquutionem in historicis Verbi exprimi potest.$ </p>
