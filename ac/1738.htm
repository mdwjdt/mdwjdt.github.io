<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1738节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1738.</strong>“亚伯兰就把所得的拿出十分之一来，给麦基洗德”表从胜利得来的余留。这从“十分之一”表余留（参看<a href="576.htm">576</a>节）的含义清楚可知。至于何为余留，可参看前文（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>节），那里说明，它们是赋予人的爱和仁的一切状态，因而是纯真与平安的一切状态。这些状态自婴儿时就被赋予了人，但却随着这人成年而日益减少。不过，当人经历重生时，除了这些余留外，他还会接受新的余留，因而接受新生命。因为人正是通过余留或凭借余留而成为人，没有爱和仁的状态，以及纯真的状态（这些状态会渗透到其生命的其它状态中），人就不再是人，而是变得比野兽更坏。在试探的争战中所获得的余留就是本节所表示的。亚伯兰给麦基洗德的十分之一所表示的，就是这些余留。它们全都是主通过不断争战并得胜而积聚的爱的属天事物。主凭借争战并得胜不断与神性本质合一，直到祂的人性本质也变成爱，或生命的本有（存在），也就是耶和华为止。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1738.</strong> And [Abram] gave him a tenth of everything symbolizes the remnant gained through victory. This can be seen from the symbolism of tenths, or tithes, as a remnant, which was discussed previously (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576" target=_top>576</a>). For the definition of a remnant, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_561" target=_top>561</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661" target=_top>661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050" target=_top>1050</a>. To be specific, a remnant is all the phases of love and charity — and therefore all the phases of innocence and peace — with which we are gifted. These states are given to us from infancy on, although they dwindle as we continue on into adulthood, until we start to regenerate. Then in addition to the earlier remnant, we also receive a new remnant, and with it, new life. It is our remnant that makes us human. When we lack an outlook of love and charity and an outlook of innocence that permeate all the other moods of our life, we are not human but worse than any wild animal.<br />The remnant acquired during spiritual battle is what is meant here. This remnant is what the tithes that Abram gave Melchizedek symbolize. It is all the heavenly qualities of love that the Lord amassed through his unceasing struggles and victories, by which he was constantly integrating his divine nature, until finally his human side likewise became love, or in other words, the vital essence of life — that is, Jehovah. </p>

And he gave him tithes of all. That this signifies remains derived from victory, is evident from the signification of "tithes" as being remains (spoken of before, n. 576). But what remains are may be 
seen above (n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 661, 1050), namely, that they are all the states of love and charity, and consequently all the states of innocence and peace, with which a man is gifted. These states 
are given to man from infancy, but less by degrees as the man advances into adult age. But when a man is being regenerated, he then receives new remains also, besides the former, thus new life. For 
it is from remains, or by remains, that a man is a man; for without the state of love and charity, and without the state of innocence-which states insinuate themselves into the other states of his life-a 
man is not a man, but is worse than any wild beast. The remains acquired in the combats of temptations are those which are here meant. These remains are what are signified by the tithes given to 
Melchizedek by Abram; and they are all the celestial things of love which the Lord procured to Himself by the continual combats and victories by which He was continually being united to His Divine Essence, 
until His Human Essence in like manner became Love, or the Being of life, that is, Jehovah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1738</b></p><p><b>1738.</b>
'And he gave him a tenth of everything' means remnants gained from victory. This is clear from the meaning of 'tenths' as remnants, dealt with already in <a href="576.htm">576</a>. For what remnants are however, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, where it is shown that they are all the states of love and charity, and all the states of innocence and peace, with which a person is endowed. He is endowed with these states 
from earliest childhood, though that endowment gradually diminishes as he advances into adult life. But while a person is being regenerated he receives, in addition to those he has already, new remnants, 
and thus new life; for it is from, or by means of, remnants that a person is enabled to be human. In fact, if devoid of the state of love and charity, and if devoid of the state of innocence - states 
that instill themselves into all the other states of his life-a person is no longer human, but worse than any wild animal. It is remnants acquired during the conflicts brought about by temptations 
that are meant in the present verse. These remnants are what the tenths given to Melchizedek by Abram mean. They are also all the celestial things of love which the Lord gathered to Himself through 
the constant conflicts and victories by means of which He was constantly being united to the Divine Essence until the point was reached when His Human Essence as well had become Love, or the Being (Esse) 
of life, that is, Jehovah. </p>

'Et dedit illi decimas de omnibus': quod significet reliquias ex victoria, constat ex significatione 'decimarum' quod sint 'reliquiae,' de qua prius n. 576; quid autem reliquiae, videatur n. 468, 530, 
560, 561, 661, 1050, nempe quod sint omnes status amoris et charitatis, proinde omnes status innocentiae et pacis quibus donatur homo; hi status donantur homini ab infantia, sed minus per gradus ut 
homo in adultam aetatem pergit; at cum regeneratur homo, tunc praeter priores etiam novas reliquias accipit, ita novam vitam; nam homo a reliquiis seu per reliquias habet ut sit homo; homo enim absque 
statu amoris et charitatis, et absque statu innocentiae, qui se insinuant ceteris ejus vitae statibus, non est homo, sed pejor omni fera. Reliquiae acquisitae in pugnis tentationum sunt quae hic intelliguntur; 
hae reliquiae sunt quae per 'decimas datas Malkizedecho ab Abramo' significantur, suntque omnia caelestia amoris quae Dominus sibi comparavit per continuas pugnas et victorias, per quas continue 
uniebatur Essentiae Divinae, usque dum Essentia Ipsius Humana similiter facta est Amor, seu Esse vitae, hoc est, Jehovah. </p>
