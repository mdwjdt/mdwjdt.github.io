<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2367节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2367.</strong>至于“舍下”表在一种（对那善）一般的模糊觉察内，情况是这样：对世人，甚至重生者而言，对善与真的觉察是非常模糊的，那些具有诸如在此由“罗得”所代表的外在敬拜之人尤其如此。当一个人处于肉体之物，即活在肉身时，他的情感和他的觉察一样，是非常一般，因而非常模糊的，无论他多么以为情况并非如此。每一个细微的情感，甚至构成其觉察的每一个观念里面都有无数细节，这些细节在他看来如同一个简单的实体。蒙主怜悯，这一点等到论述情感和观念时再予以说明。人若深入思考，有时也能检查并描述他里面的一些事物，但只要人活在肉身，那么隐藏起来的无数其它事物，事实无限事物从不，也不可能进入他的意识。不过，一旦肉体和世俗之物脱去，这些事物就变得可见。这一点可从以下事实明显看出来：拥有爱与仁之善的人进入来世后，会从模糊的生命进入更清晰的生命，如同从夜里进入白昼；并根据他进入主天堂的程度而进入越来越清晰的光中，直到抵达天使所在之光，即无法形容的聪明智慧之光。与这种光相比，世人所在的光就是黑暗。这就是为何此处经上说他们“到我舍下”，这句话的意思是，罗得所代表的那些人处在一般的模糊觉察内；也就是说，他们对主的神性和圣洁知之甚少；但尽管如此，他们仍承认并相信，主的神性和圣洁的确存在，并且就居于仁之善中，即在那些具有这种善的人当中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2367</b></p><p><b>2367.</b>
As to the "shadow of the roof" denoting in an obscure general [perception], the case is this: with man, even when regenerate, the perception of good and truth is very obscure, and this is still more 
the case with a man who is in external worship, such as is here represented by "Lot." While a man is in corporeal things (that is, while he is living in the body), the affections, like the perceptions, 
are of a very general nature, and consequently are very obscure, no matter how much the man may suppose that such is not the case. There are myriads of myriads of particulars in every little affection, 
and even in every idea of his perception, that appear to him as all one, as of the Lord's Divine mercy will be shown hereafter, when affections and ideas are treated of. Sometimes it is possible for 
a man by reflection to explore and describe a few of the things that are in him, but there lie hidden innumerable other things, things without limit or measure, that never come to his knowledge, nor 
can come so long as he is living in the body, but which become manifest after corporeal and worldly things have been abolished-as may be sufficiently evident from the fact that when a man who has been 
in the good of love and of charity passes into the other life, he passes from an obscure life into a clearer one, as from a kind of night into day; and in proportion as he passes into the Lord's heaven, 
in the same proportion does he pass into a light that is more and more clear, until he arrives at the light in which are the angels, a light of intelligence and wisdom that is unutterable. In comparison 
with this the light in which is man, is darkness. Hence it is here said that they "came under the shadow of his roof;" by which is signified that those signified by "Lot" are in their obscure 
general [perception]; that is, that they know but little concerning the Lord's Divine and Holy; but that nevertheless they acknowledge and have faith in the existence of these, and that these are in 
the good of charity, that is, present with those who are in this good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2367</b></p><p><b>2367.</b>
The implications of 'the shadow of the roof' meaning within a general obscure [perception of that good] are that with man, even one who is regenerate, the perception of good and truth lies in obscurity, 
the more so with him whose worship is external, who is represented here by Lot. When a person is engrossed in bodily things, that is, during his lifetime, his affections, like his perceptions, are 
very general and therefore very obscure, however much he imagines that they are not so. There are myriads upon myriads of parts to each tiny affection, as there are to each idea comprising his perception, 
which to him appears to be a simple entity. This in the Lord's Divine mercy will be shown when the subject of affections and ideas is reached. Man is sometimes able, when he reflects, to examine 
and describe a few of the things within him; but countless, indeed limitless, things lie unseen which neither do nor can enter his awareness as long as he is living in the body but which do become visible 
once bodily and worldly things have been put away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This becomes quite clear from the fact that a person with whom the good that flows from love and charity exists, on crossing over into the 
next life, passes from an obscure into a clearer life, as if from a kind of night into day. And to the extent he has entered the Lord's heaven the clearer is the light until he reaches the light in 
which angels live, whose light of intelligence and wisdom lies beyond description. The inferior light in which man lives is in comparison like darkness. This is why it is said here that they came under 
the shadow of his roof, the meaning of which is that those represented by Lot dwell in their general [perception]. That is to say, they know very little about the Lord's Divinity and His Holiness but 
they nevertheless acknowledge and believe that His Divinity and His Holiness do exist and that they reside within the good of charity, that is, among those in whom that good is present. </p>

Quod `umbra trabis' sit in communi obscuro, ita se habet perceptio boni et veri non est nisi in obscuro apud hominem, etiam regeneratum, magis apud eum qui in externo cultu est qui per `Lotum hic repraesentatur; 
affectiones sicut perceptiones, quando in corporei est homo, hoc est, cum in corpore vivit, sunt communissimae, proinde obscurissimae, utcumque homo putat quod non ita sit; sunt myriades 
myriadum in unaquavis ejus affectiuncula, etiam in unaquavis ejus perceptionis idea, quae sicut una ei apparet, quod ex Divina Domini Misericordia ostendendum venit ubi de affectionibus et ideis agetur; 
homo pauca ex iis quae insunt, per reflexionem quandoque potes explorare ac describere, sed innumerabilia, immo indefinita, latent, quae nusquam ad ejus cognitionem veniunt, nec venire possunt quamdiu 
in corpore vivit, sed patent postquam corporea et mundana exstincta sunt; [2] quod satis constare potest ex eo quod homo qui in bono amoris et charitatis fuit, cum in alteram vitam transit, a vita 
obscura in clariorem, sicut a quadam nocte in diem, veniat, et quantum in caelum Domini, tantum in clariorem, usque ad lucem in qua sunt angeli, quorum lux intelligentiae et sapientiae ineffabilis est; 
ipsum lumen in quo est homo respective est sicut tenebricosum: inde hi dicitur quod `venerint in umbram trabis suae,' quo significatur quo in suo communi obscuro sint, hoc est, quod parum sciat de 
Divino {1} et Sancto Domini, sed usque quod agnoscat {2} et fidem habeat, quod sit {3}, et quod illud in bono charitatis sit, hoc est, apud eos qui in illo bono sunt. 	@1 i Humano.$ 	@2 illa.$ 	@3
