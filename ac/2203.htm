<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2203节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2203.</strong>“说，我既已衰败，岂能有这喜事呢”表那真理所怀有的情感不愿改变自己的状态。这从“衰败”和“岂能有这喜事”的含义清楚可知：“衰败”是指要脱去人性，因而改变状态，如前面所解释的（<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>节）；“岂能有这喜事”是指不渴望这种事，因而是指这不是它的情感。从有关撒拉的论述（<a href="2196.htm">2196</a>节），即“撒拉站在那人后边的帐棚门口”明显可知这些事是怎么回事。也就是说，对于真理，人类理性具有这样的性质，即它无法理解何为神性，因为那真理沉浸于表象。所以，它不相信它无法理解的事，并且它不相信的事也不会对它产生影响。这理性所沉浸的表象则会对它产生影响。因为这些表象本身就有快乐；若失去这些表象，它必以为再没有快乐可言；而天堂的情感并不在表象中，只在良善与真理本身中。由于理性真理具有这种性质，所以它值得原谅，并被许可沉浸于表象，以它们为乐。当主将自己与神性联结起来时，沉浸于表象的这种真理在此由撒拉来代表。这解释了为何经上说，她站在帐棚门口，“暗笑说，我既已衰败，岂能有这喜事呢？”这句话表示理性真理所怀有的情感不愿改变自己的状态。</p>

Saying, After I am grown old, shall I have pleasure? That this signifies that it was not of the affection of that truth that it should change its state, is evident from the signification of "growing 
old," as being to put off the human, and thus to change the state (as explained above, n. 2198); and from the signification of "shall I have pleasure?" as being not to desire; thus that this was not its 
affection. How the case is with these things is evident from what was said of Sarah above (n. 2196), that she stood at the door of the tent, and it was behind him; that is, that the human rational 
as to truth is of such a nature that it cannot understand what the Divine is, for the reason that that truth is in appearances; and therefore that which it cannot understand, it does not believe; and 
by that which it does not believe it is not affected.  The appearances in which the rational is, are such as to affect it, for there is delight in the appearances themselves; and therefore if it is deprived 
of appearances, it supposes that there is nothing of delight left; whereas heavenly affection is not in appearances, but in good and truth itself. As rational truth is of this nature, this is 
pardoned, and it is permitted to be in appearances, and to have delight in them. Such truth as was in appearances is represented by Sarah, when the Lord had conjoined Himself with the Divine, and therefore 
it is said that she "stood at the door," and that she "laughed and said, After I am grown old, shall I have pleasure?" By this is signified that it was not of its affection that it should change 
its state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2203</b></p><p><b>2203.</b>
'Saying, After I have grown old, shall I have this pleasure?' means that the affection possessed by that truth had no inclination to change its state. This is clear from the meaning of 'growing old' 
as casting off the human and so as changing its state, dealt with above in <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, and from the meaning of 'shall I have this pleasure?' as not desiring it, thus that this affection was not so inclined. 
The implication of these matters becomes clear from what has been stated above in <a href="2196.htm">2196</a> about Sarah standing at the tent door, and this being behind him, namely that the human rational as regards truth 
is such that it is not able to understand what the Divine is, for the reason that that truth is immersed in appearances, and consequently that which it cannot understand it does not believe, and that 
which it does not believe does not affect it. The appearances in which the rational is immersed are such that they do affect it, for the appearances themselves bring delight and therefore if deprived 
of appearances the rational imagines that no delight is left, whereas heavenly affection is not immersed in appearances but in good and truth themselves. But as rational truth is of this nature, it 
is also excusable and permissible for it to be immersed in appearances and to take delight in them. Such truth immersed in appearances is represented here by 'Sarah' when the Lord joined Himself to the 
Divine. This explains why it is said that she stood at the tent door and that she laughed and said, 'After I have grown old shall I have this pleasure?' by which is meant that the affection possessed 
by rational truth had no inclination to change its state. </p>

`Dicendo, Postquam consenui, num erit mihi voluptas?': quod significet quod veri illius affectio non esset ut mutaret statum, constat `a significatione `consenescere' quod sit exuere humanum, ita mutare 
statum, de qua supra n. 2198: et ex significatione `num erit mihi voluptas' quod sit non desiderare, ita quod illud non esset affectio ejus.  Quomodo haec se habent, constare potest ab illis quae 
supra n. 2196 dicta de Sarah, quod `steterit ad januam tentorii, et ea post illum,' nempe quod rationale humanum quoad verum tale sit ut non intelligere possit quid Divinum est, ex causa quia verum illud 
in apparentiis est, quare quod non intelligere potest, nec credit, et quod non credit, eo nec afficitur; apparentiae in quibus rationale est, tales sunt ut afficiant, nam in ipsis apparentiis est 
delectatio; quare si (x)privaretur apparentiis, putat nihil delectationis plus esse; cum tamen caelestis affectio non est in apparentiis sed in ipso bono et vero; {1} quia verum rationale tale est, etiam 
ignoscitur ei, et admittitur ut in apparentiis sit, et in illis delectationem habeat.  Tale verum quod in apparentiis fuit, repraesentatur {2} per `Sarah,' cum Dominus conjunxit Se cum Divino, quare 
dicitur quod `illa steterit ad januam, et quod riserit et dixerit, Postquam consenui, num erit mihi voluptas?' quibus significatur quod non illius affectio esset ut mutaret statum. 	@1 i et.$ 	@2 i hic.$ </p>
