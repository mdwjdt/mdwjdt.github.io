<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6089节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6089.</strong>“约瑟领他父亲雅各进去”表来自内在的总体真理的同在。这从“进去”或“领”的含义和“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“进去”或“领”是指使得同在，“进去”到某人那里是指同在（参看<a href="5934.htm">5934</a>，<a href="6063.htm">6063</a>节）；“雅各”是指属世真理的教义，以及属世真理（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>，<a href="3525.htm">3525</a>，<a href="3546.htm">3546</a>，<a href="4538.htm">4538</a>节），在此是指总体上的真理，因为他的儿子们代表具体的真理。它之所以来自内在，是因为“约瑟”是内在，属世层中的真理来自内在。总体真理被称为约瑟的“父亲”，是因为人首先被引入总体真理。此后这总体真理被具体真理充实，最后出现来自内在的对这些真理的洞见，也就是推理和理解力。这一点在人身上是显而易见的，因为判断力自童年就在他里面发展。当一个人正在新生或重生时，属灵真理与良善也是如此。但内在从属世层中的总体真理中出现后，状态就发生变化；内在不再承认属世层中的真理为它的父亲，而是视之为仆人。约瑟所作关于他父亲的梦清楚表明，那时它变成一个仆人；在梦中，他说：太阳、月亮和十一颗星向他下拜；为此他父亲说：<br />你作的这是什么梦！难道我和你母亲、你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗？（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.9.htm">37:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这解释了为何当着约瑟的面，他的哥哥多次称他父亲为他的“仆人”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.28.htm">43:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创44.24.htm">44:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创44.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创44.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创44.31.htm">31</a>）；此外，约瑟是埃及全地的主人，因而也是他父亲的主人。</p>

And Joseph brought Jacob his father. That this signifies the presence of general truth from the internal, is evident from the signification of "causing to come," or "bringing," as being to make present, 
and of "coming unto" anyone, as being presence (see n. 5934, 6063); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the doctrine of natural truth, and also natural truth (n. 3305, 3509, 3525, 3546, 
4538), here truth in general, because his sons represent truths in particular. That it is from the internal, is because "Joseph" is the internal, from which is truth in the natural. General truth is 
called the "father" of Joseph, because general truth is insinuated with man first of all. This is afterward enriched with particular truths, and lastly there comes forth the view of them from the internal, 
that is, there come forth reason and understanding. This is very manifest in the case of man, for his judgment increases from infancy. It is the same with spiritual truths and goods, when a man 
is being born anew, or is being regenerated. But after the internal has come forth from general truth in the natural, the state is changed, and the internal no longer acknowledges truth in the natural 
as father, but as servant. That it becomes a servant is declared by Joseph's dream about his father: that the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to him; wherefore his father said, "What 
is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?" (Gen. 37:9, 10); and therefore also his father is so often called 
by his sons, in the presence of Joseph, his "servant" (Gen. 43:28; 44:24, 27, 30, 31); and moreover Joseph was lord in all the land of Egypt, thus also over his father. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6089</b></p><p><b>6089.</b>
'And Joseph caused Jacob his father to come' means the presence of general truth coming from the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'causing to come., or bringing to, as causing to be present, 
and 'coming to someone' as presence, <a href="5934.htm">5934</a>, <a href="6063.htm">6063</a>; and from the representation of 'Jacob' as the doctrine of natural truth, and also natural truth itself, dealt with in <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="3509.htm">3509</a>, <a href="3525.htm">3525</a>, <a href="3546.htm">3546</a>, <a href="4538.htm">4538</a>, 
at this point truth in general since his sons represent particular truths. The reason why it comes from the internal is that Joseph' is the internal, from which truth in the natural comes. General truth 
is called 'Joseph's father' because a person first of all is introduced into general truth. After that it is enriched with particular truths, and in the end there comes an insight into those truths 
from the internal, which is reason and understanding. This is plain to see in a person, for the power of judgement develops in him from young childhood onwards. Something similar happens with spiritual 
truths and forms of good when a person is being born anew or regenerated. But after the internal has come into being from general truth in the natural the state is turned around; the internal no longer 
acknowledges truth in the natural as its father but as a servant. That it is then a servant is made clear by Joseph's dream regarding his father, in which he says that the sun and moon, and the eleven 
stars were bowing down to him, which led his father to say, </p>
<blockquote>
What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall we indeed come - I and your mother, and your brothers - to bow down to you to the earth? 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2037:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 37:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This explains why, in Joseph's presence, the other sons call his father so many times his servant, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2043:28;%2044:24,%2027,%2030,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 43:28; 44:24, 27, 30, 31</a>, besides which Joseph was lord in the whole land 
of Egypt, thus even over his father.  </p>

`Et venire fecit Joseph Jacobum patrem suum': quod significet praesentiam veri communis ab interno, constat ex significatione `venire facere' seu adducere quod sit sistere praesentem, et `venire ad 
aliquem' quod sit praesentia, n. 5934, 6063; et ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit doctrina veri naturalis, tum verum naturale, de qua n. 3305, 3509, 3525, (x)3546, 4538, hic verum in communi, quia 
`filii ejus' repraesentant vera in particulari; quod ab interno, est quia `Joseph' est internum, a quo verum in naturali.  Verum commune vocatur `pater Josephi' quia omnium primo apud hominem insinuatur 
verum commune, hoc dein locupletatur veris particularibus, ac ultimo existit intuitio illorum ab interno, seu ratio et intellectus; hoc patet manifeste apud hominem, nam ei judicium ab infantia crescit; 
similiter se habet cum veris et bonis spiritualibus cum homo e novo nascitur, seu regeneratur; postquam autem internum exstiterat a vero communi in naturali, vertitur status, et internum amplius 
non agnoscit verum in naturali pro patre sed pro famulo; quod famulus, indicatur per somnium Josephi de patre suo, Quod nempe sol et luna, et undecim stellae incurvarent se  illi;... quare dixit pater, 
Quid somnium hoc quod somniasti an veniendo veniemus ego et mater tua, et fratres tui, ad incurvandum nos tibi terram? Gen. xxxvii 9, 10; </p>
<p>et ideo pater ejus a filiis coram Josepho toties vocatur 
servus ejus, et. xliii 28; xliv 24, 27, 30, 31; et quoque Josephus dominus fuit in tota terra Aegypti, ita etiam super patrem suum. </p>
