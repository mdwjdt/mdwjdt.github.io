<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第781节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>781.</strong>创世记7:16．凡要进入的，就是凡有血肉的，有公有母，都进去了，正如神所吩咐他的；耶和华关闭他身后的路。 <br />“凡要进入的”表居于该教会成员身上的事物。“凡有血肉的，有公有母，都进去了”表居于他身上的各类真理与良善。“正如神所吩咐他的”表为了预备他接受。“耶和华关闭他身后的路”表这人不再享有属天教会成员所享有的与天堂的那类交流。</p>

And those entering — a male and a female of all flesh — entered as God had commanded him. And Jehovah closed it behind him.<br />Those entering symbolizes attributes of the people in the church. A male and a female of all flesh entered means that they had every kind of truth and goodness in them. As God had commanded means that they had been prepared to receive such things. And Jehovah closed it behind him means that people were no longer able to communicate with heaven as the people of the heavenly church had. </p>

Verse 16. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him; and Jehovah shut after him. "They that went in" signifies the things that were with the man of the church; 
"went in male and female of all flesh" signifies that there were with him truths and goods of every kind; "as God had commanded" signifies for the reception of which he had been prepared; "and Jehovah 
shut after him" signifies that man no longer had such communication with heaven as had the man of the celestial church. </p>

Verse 16 And those who were going in, male and female of all flesh, went in, as God had commanded him; and Jehovah closed the way behind him.  </p>
<p>'Those who were going in' means things residing with 
the member of the Church. 'Male and female of all flesh went in' means that truths and goods of every kind resided with him. 'As God had commanded' means for the reception of which he had been made ready. 
'And Jehovah closed the way behind him' means that man no longer had the kind of communication with heaven that the member of the celestial Church had had. </p>

Vers. 16.  Et intrantes, masculus et femina de omni carne intrarunt, quemadmodum praeceperat illi Deus; et clausit Jehovah post {1} illum. 'Intrantes' significant quae apud hominem Ecclesiae: 'masculus 
et femina de omni carne intrarunt' significant quod vera et bona omnis generis apud eum essent: 'sicut praeceperat Deus' significat, ad quae recipienda praeparatus esset: 'et clausit Jehovah post 
illum' significat quod amplius non communicationem haberet homo cum caelo, quidem caelestis Ecclesiae homo.   	@1 apud I, but see below.$ </p>
