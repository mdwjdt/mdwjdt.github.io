<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3641节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3641.</strong>所有人，无论天堂里的还是地狱里的，看起来都像是竖立的，头朝上，脚朝下。然而，在他们自己，并且在天使眼里，天堂里的身位（body-positions）完全不同于地狱里的。也就是说，天堂里的人头朝主，主在那里是太阳，因而是共同的中心，一切位置和方位都源于这个共同中心。但在天使眼里，地狱里的人头朝下，脚朝上，因而具有一个颠倒的身位，以及倾斜的身位。因为天堂里的人看为上的，地狱里的人看为下，而天堂里的人看为下的，地狱里的人则看为上。这在某种程度上表明，天堂可以说如何与地狱成为一体；或它们如何在位置和方位上一起呈现为一个整体。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3641</b></p><p><b>3641.</b>
All, both they who are in heaven and they who are in hell, appear erect, with the head upward and the feet downward; when nevertheless in themselves, and according to angelic vision, they are in a different 
position. That is to say, they who are in heaven have their heads toward the Lord, who is the Sun there, and thus is the common center from whom is all position and situation; whereas in the sight 
of the angels the infernals have their heads downward and their feet upward, thus in a position opposite, and also oblique; for to the infernals that is beneath which to the celestials is above, 
and that is above which to the celestials is beneath. From this it is in some degree manifest how heaven may as it were make a one with hell; or how they may together present a one in situation and position.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3641</b></p><p><b>3641.</b>
All appear erect - both those in heaven and those in hell - with their heads in the air and their feet on the ground. Yet in themselves, and in the eyes of the angels, the body-positions in heaven are 
different from those in hell. Those who are in heaven appear with their heads pointing up towards the Lord who is the Sun there and so the common centre from which every station and position is derived. 
But those who are in hell appear in the eyes of angels with their heads downwards and their feet upwards, and so with an upside down body-position and also a bent one. For that which to those in 
heaven is above is to those in hell below, and that which to those in heaven is below is to those in hell above. This shows to some extent how heaven can so to speak make one with hell, that is, how together 
they can resemble a single entity so far as position and station go. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3641</b>
</p><b>3641.</b>
Apparent omnes, tam qui in caelo quam qui in inferno sunt, erecti, capite sursum et pedibus deorsum, at usque in se et secundum visum angelicum sunt in alio positu, nempe qui in caelo, capite versum 
Dominum, Qui ibi est Sol et sic centrum commune, a quo omnis positus et situs; at infernales coram visu angelico sunt capite deorsum et pedibus sursum, ita in positu opposito, etiam in obliquo; est enim 
infernalibus id infra quod caelestibus supra, et infernalibus id supra quod caelestibus infra. Inde aliquantum patescit quomodo caelum cum inferno possit quasi unum facere, seu simul referre unum in 
sim et positu. </p>
