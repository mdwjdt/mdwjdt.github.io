And he divided [his forces] against [the enemy] by night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them all the way to Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus.<br />He divided [his forces] against [the enemy] by night means the shadow that the apparent goodness and truth were in. He and his servants symbolize the rational self and everything in the outer self that obeyed it. And struck them symbolizes the rescue. And pursued them all the way to Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus, symbolizes the extent. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1711</b></p><p><b>1711.</b>
Verse 15. And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus. "He divided himself against them by night," 
signifies the shade in which the apparent goods and truths were; "he and his servants," signifies the rational man, and the things in the external man which obeyed; "and smote them," signifies vindication; 
"and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus," signifies as far as this extended. </p>

Verse 15 And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus. </p>
<p>'He divided himself against them by 
night' means the shade which the apparent goods and truths were in. 'He and his servants' means the Rational Man and those things in the External Man that were obedient. 'And he smote them' means an act 
of reclamation. 'And he pursued them as far as Hobah, which is on the left of Damasus' means to that particular extent. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1711</b>
</p><b>1711.</b>
Vers. 15. Et distribuit se super eos noctu, ille et servi illius, et percussit eos, et persecutus est eos usque ad Hobam, quae a sinistra Damasco. 'Distribuit se super eos noctu' significat umbram in 
qua fuerunt bona et vera apparentia: 'ille et servi illius' significat Rationalem Hominem et quae in Externo oboediverunt: 'et percussit eos' significat vindicationem: 'et persecutus est eos usque ad 
Hobam quae a sinistra Damasco' significat extensionem quousque. </p>
