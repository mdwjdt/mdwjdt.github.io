<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6821节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6821.</strong>我们的国家比起社区或社群更是邻舍，因为它就像父母，是人的出生之地；它养育人，保护他免受一切伤害。当出于爱照着国家需要向我们的国家行善，利益它；这些需要主要涉及它的维持、公共生活和属灵生活。凡热爱自己的国家，并出于善愿向它行善，利益它的人，在来世都热爱主的国；因为在那里，主的国成了他的国家。凡爱主国家的人都爱主，因为主是其国度全部中的全部；严格来说，主的国度是与那国度的居民同住，并且他们从主所接受的良善和真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6821</b></p><p><b>6821.</b>
Our country is more the neighbor than a society, because it is like a parent; for there the man has been born; it nourishes him, and protects him from harm. Our country is to be benefited from love, 
according to its necessities, which chiefly regard its sustenance, its civil life, and its spiritual life. He who loves his country, and from good will benefits it, in the other life loves the Lord's 
kingdom; for there the Lord's kingdom is his country. And he who loves the Lord's kingdom, loves the Lord, because the Lord is the all in all of His kingdom; for what is properly called "the Lord's kingdom" 
is the good and truth from the Lord in those who are in it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6821</b></p><p><b>6821.</b>
One's country is the neighbour over the community because it is like a parent, for being the place where the person is born, it nurtures him and protects him from all harm. One ought out of love for 
one's country to do good to it according to its needs, which have regard primarily to its sustenance, its public life, and its spiritual life. Anyone who loves his country and out of goodwill does good 
to it will in the next life love the Lord's kingdom, for there the Lord's kingdom becomes his country. And anyone who loves the Lord's kingdom loves the Lord since the Lord is the All in all of His 
kingdom, for strictly speaking the Lord's kingdom is the goodness and truth which reside with the inhabitants of that kingdom, and which they receive from the Lord. </p>

</p><b>6821.</b>
Patria est proximus prae societate quia parentis instar est, ibi enim homo natus est, ipsum nutrit, et ab injuriis tutatur. Patriae ex amore benefaciendum secundum necessitates ejus quae imprimis spectant 
ejus victum, ejus vitam civilem, et ejus vitam spiritualem.  Qui amat patriam et ei ex benevelle benefacit, is in altera vita amat regnum Domini, nam {1}ibi est regnum Domini ei patria; et qui 
amat regnum Domini, is amat Dominum, quia Dominus est Omne in omnibus Sui regni; nam quod proprie vocatur regnum Domini est bonum et verum, quod apud illos qui ibi, a Domino. 	@1 Regnum Domini est ei 
sua Patria$ </p>
