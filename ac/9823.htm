<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9823节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9823.</strong>“胸牌”表从神性良善闪耀出来的神性真理。这从“胸牌”的含义清楚可知，“胸牌”是指从神性良善闪耀出来的神性真理，此处是指在逐渐来自天上至内在事物的最后和最低事物里面。因为上面有胸牌的以弗得代表属灵国度最低级的事物，因而代表天堂最低级的事物。“胸牌”之所以具有这种含义，是因为它被系于心脏所在的胸部，并且镶满宝石；而心对应于属天良善，就是从主所获得的对主之爱的良善；十二颗宝石对应于源于这良善的神性真理。这就是“胸牌”在至高意义上表示从主的神性良善闪耀出来的神性真理的原因。心对应于属天良善，也就是从主所获得的对主之爱的良善（参看<a href="170.htm">170</a>，<a href="172.htm">172</a>，<a href="176.htm">176</a>，<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>，<a href="7542.htm">7542</a>，<a href="9050.htm">9050</a>，<a href="9300.htm">9300</a>，<a href="9495.htm">9495</a>节）；十二颗宝石对应于源于神性良善的神性真理，这一点可见于本章下文，那里充分描述了这胸牌。在下文，胸牌因它所镶满的这十二颗宝石而被称为“决断胸牌或决断牌”，还被称为乌陵和土明。它被系于心脏所在的胸部，这一点从下面对它的描述明显看出来；在那里，经上以这些话明确阐述了这一点：“亚伦要带着决断胸牌上以色列人的名字，放在心上”（28:29）；之后经上又说：“亚伦进到耶和华面前的时候，它们要在亚伦的心上；亚伦要带着以色列人的决断牌，在耶和华面前常放在心上”（28:30）。“决断（judgment）”也表示从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，这一点可见于下文。</p>

A breastplate. That this signifies Divine truth shining forth from Divine good, is evident from the signification of "the breastplate," as being Divine truth shining forth from Divine good, here in ultimates 
progressively from the inmost things in the heavens. For the ephod, on which was this breastplate, represented the ultimates of the spiritual kingdom, and consequently the ultimates of heaven. 
"The breast plate" had this signification because it was fastened upon the breast where the heart is, and was filled with precious stones, and the heart corresponds to celestial good, which is the good 
of love to the Lord from the Lord, and the twelve precious stones correspond to Divine truths thence derived. Hence by "the breastplate" in the supreme sense is signified Divine truth shining forth 
from the Divine good of the Lord. (That the heart corresponds to celestial good, that is, to the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, see n. 170, 172, 176, 3635, 3883-3896, 7542, 9050, 9300, 9495; 
and that the twelve precious stones correspond to Divine truths which are from the Divine good, will be seen in what follows in this chapter, where this breastplate is fully described, and is called 
"the breastplate of judgment," and "the Urim and Thummim," from the twelve precious stones with which it was filled.) That it was fastened upon the breast where is the heart, is evident from the description 
given of it below, where this is plainly stated in these words, "Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart" (verse 29); and again, "They shall 
be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before Jehovah; and Aaron shall carry the judgment of the sons of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually" (verse 30). That "judgment" also denotes 
the Divine truth which proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord, will be seen in what follows. </p>

'A breastplate' means Divine Truth shining forth from Divine Good. This is clear from the meaning of 'a breastplate' as Divine Truth shining forth from Divine Good, in this instance within the last and 
lowest things in progression from inmost ones in the heavens. For the ephod which that breastplate rested on represented the lowest things of the spiritual kingdom, and therefore the lowest things 
of heaven. The reason why 'the breastplate' has this meaning is that it was tied on over the breast, where the heart lies, and was filled with precious stones, and the heart corresponds to celestial good, 
which is the good of love to the Lord received from the Lord, while the twelve precious stones correspond to Divine Truths springing from that good. This is the reason why in the highest sense 'the 
breastplate' means Divine Truth shining forth from the Lord's Divine Good. For the correspondence of the heart to celestial good, or the good of love to the Lord received from the Lord, see <a href="170.htm">170</a>, <a href="172.htm">172</a>, <a href="176.htm">176</a>, <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>, <a href="7542.htm">7542</a>, <a href="9050.htm">9050</a>, <a href="9300.htm">9300</a>, <a href="9494.htm">9494</a>; and for the correspondence of the twelve precious stones to Divine Truths which spring from Divine Good, see further on in the present chapter where the 
full description of this breastplate occurs. There it is called 'the breastplate of judgement', also the Urim and Thummim, because of the twelve precious stones with which it was filled. The fact that 
it was tied on over the breast, where the heart lies, is evident from the description of it below, where that fact is stated explicitly in these words,  </p>
<p>Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of 
Israel in the breastplate of judgement over his heart. Verse 29.  </p>
<p>And after this,  </p>
<p>They shall be over Aaron's heart, when he goes in before Jehovah. And Aaron shall carry the judgement of the 
children of Israel over his heart before Jehovah continually. Verse 30.  </p>
<p>'Judgement' too means Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good, as will be seen in what follows.  </p>

`Pectorale': quod significet Divinum Verum elucens ex Divino Bono, constat ex significatione `pectoralis' quod sit Divinum Verum elucens ex Divino Bono, hic in ultimis progressive ab intimis in caelis, 
nam ephodum, {1}super quo erat id pectorale, repraesentabat ultima regni spiritualis, proinde ultima caeli; quod `pectorale' id significet, est quia alligatum erat super pectore ubi cor, ac impletum 
lapidibus pretiosis, et cor correspondet bono caelesti, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum a Domino, et duodecim lapides pretiosi correspondent Divinis Veris inde; {2}inde per `pectorale' in supremo 
sensu significatur Divinum Verum elucens ex Divino Bono Domini; quod cor correspondeat bono caelesti, seu bono amoris {3}in Dominum a Domino, videatur n. 170, 172, 176, 3635, 3883-3896, 7542, 9050, 9300, 
9494, et quod duodecim lapides pretiosi correspondeant Divinis Veris quae ex Divino Bono, videbitur in sequentibus hujus capitis ubi pectorale hoc ample describitur, et vocatur pectorale judicii, 
ac Urim et Thumim, ex duodecim lapidibus pretiosis quibus impletum. Quod id alligatum fuerit super pectore ubi cor, constat ex descriptione ejus infra, ubi id aperte dicitur his verbis, 	Portabit Aharon 
nomina filiorum Israelis in pectorali judicii super corde suo, vers. 29: </p>
<p>et adhuc, 	Erunt super corde Aharonis in intrando illo coram Jehovah, et portabit Aharon judicium filiorum Israelis super 
corde 5110 coram Jehovah jugiter, vers. 30: </p>
<p>quod judicium etiam sit Divinum Verum procedens (c)a Divino Bono Domini, videbitur in sequentibus. @1 in$ @2 ita$ @3 a Domino et in Dominum$ </p>
