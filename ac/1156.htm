<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1156.</strong>“以利沙、他施、基提、多单”是指众多具有这类敬拜的民族，也表源于雅完所具有的外在敬拜的众多教义，也就是仪式。这从以下先知书的经文清楚看出来，论到以利沙，以西结书上说：<br />你的篷帆是用埃及绣花细麻布做的，可以作你的大旗；你的凉棚是用以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布做的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.7.htm">27:7</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗表拥有属天和属灵的仪式，或认知的人。“用埃及绣花做的”表知识，因而表代表属灵事物的仪式。“以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布”表与内在敬拜相应的仪式，因而表属天事物的代表物。此处这些话具有正面意义。论到“他施”，以赛亚书上说：<br />我差遣他们当中的幸存者到列国去，就是到他施、普勒、拉弓的路德和土巴、雅完，并辽远的海岛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.19.htm">66:19</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />他施的船只都要哀号，因为推罗变为荒场，甚至没有房屋可入。这消息是从基提地得来的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.1.htm">23:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.14.htm">14</a>）<br />其它地方也提到了他施（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.9.htm">40:9</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.9.htm">10:9</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.12.htm">27:12</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗48.7.htm">48:7</a>），在那里，它表仪式，即教义。<br />论到基提，耶利米书上说：<br />你们且过到基提海岛去察看，打发人往基达去留心查考，看曾有这样的事没有？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.10.htm">2:10</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />他又说，受欺压西顿的处女哪，你必不得再欢乐。起来！过到基提去，就是在那里也不得安歇。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.12.htm">23:12</a>）<br />此处“基提”表仪式。以西结书：<br />用巴珊的橡树作你的桨，用象牙镶嵌基提海岛的黄杨木作舱板。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.6.htm">27:6</a>）<br />这论及推罗。“基提海岛的舱板”表敬拜的外在表现，因而表仪式，它们属于属天事物的分枝。摩西书：<br />必有人乘船从基提界而来，苦害亚述，苦害希伯。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.24.htm">24:24</a>）<br />此处，“基提”也表外在敬拜，或仪式。由此清楚可知，从内义上说，所有这些名字都表真实的事物，这些真实事物具有自己的秩序。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1156.</strong> Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim were individual nations where this form of worship existed, and they symbolize individual doctrinal systems that consisted in rituals derived from the outward worship adopted by Javan. The following passages from the prophets demonstrate this.<br />Elishah comes up in Ezekiel:<br />Fine linen with embroidery from Egypt was what you spread out to serve you as a banner. Blue-violet and red-violet fabric from the islands of Elishah was your covering. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_7" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:7</a>)<br />This describes Tyre, which symbolizes people who own heavenly and spiritual riches, or knowledge. Embroidery from Egypt stands for facts and so for ritual that represents spiritual traits.{*1} Blue-violet and red-violet fabric from the islands of Elishah stands for ritual that corresponds to inward worship and so for ritual that represents heavenly traits. Elishah appears in its positive meaning here.<br />Of Tarshish, Isaiah says:<br />I will send some of them — escapees — to the nations Tarshish, Put{*2} and Lud (drawing the bow), Tubal and Javan (the distant islands). (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_19" target=_top>Isaiah 66:19</a>)<br />[2] In the same author:<br />Howl, you ships of Tarshish, because Tyre has been wiped out, so that there is not a house to enter. This has been revealed to them from the land of Kittim. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_1" target=_top>Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />There is more on Tarshish in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_9" target=_top>Isaiah 60:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_10_9" target=_top>Jeremiah 10:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:12</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_psalms_48_7" target=_top>Psalms 48:7</a>; and in these places it stands for ritual, or in other words, doctrinal affairs.<br />Kittim is mentioned in Jeremiah:<br />Go over into the islands of Kittim{*3} and see, and into Arabia and pay close attention: has anything like this ever happened? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_10" target=_top>Jeremiah 2:10</a>)<br />And in Isaiah:<br />He said, "You must no longer continue to gloat, oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Get up, go over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_12" target=_top>Isaiah 23:12</a>)<br />Kittim stands for ritual. In Ezekiel:<br />Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; your planking they made of ivory — the daughter of steps{*4} from the islands of Kittim. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:6</a>)<br />This is about Tyre. Ship planking from the islands of Kittim stands for outward acts of worship — and so for ritual — belonging to the heavenly category. In Moses:<br />Ships [are coming] from the shore of Kittim, and they will harry Assyria, and they will harry Eber. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_24" target=_top>Numbers 24:24</a>)<br />Here too Kittim stands for outward worship and so for ritual.<br />Such things go to show that on a deeper level all these names symbolize inner phenomena, arranged in their proper order.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The "facts" that have to do with representative ritual are those that detail the representative meaning of ritual objects and actions.

Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. That these were so many nations, with whom there was such worship, and that they signify so many doctrinals which were rituals, derived from the external worship 
with Javan, may be seen from the following passages in the Prophets. Of "Elishah" it is written in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy spreading forth, that it might 
be to thee for an ensign; blue and crimson from the Isles of Elishah were thy covering (Ezek. 27:7). The subject here treated of is Tyre, by which they are signified who possess celestial and spiritual 
riches, or knowledges; "embroidered work from Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges, and thus rituals representative of spiritual things; "blue and crimson from the isles of Elishah," rituals corresponding 
to internal worship, thus representatives of celestial things. The words are here used in the genuine sense. Of "Tarshish" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to 
Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the Isles afar off (Isa. 66:19).      Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house for entering in; 
from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them (Isa. 23:1, 14). And further concerning Tarshish in Isa. 40:9; Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:12; Ps. 48:7-where it denotes rituals, that is, doctrinals. Of "Kittim" 
in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Pass over to the isles of Kittim and see; and to Arabia, and consider diligently, whether there hath been such a thing (Jer. 2:10). And in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt no more rejoice, 
O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Zidon; arise, pass over to Kittim; even there shalt thou have no rest (Isa. 33:12), where "Kittim" denotes rituals. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Of the oaks of Bashan have 
they made thine oars; they have made thy planks of ivory, the daughter of steps, from the isles of Kittim (Ezek. 27:6). This is said of Tyre; "the planks of a ship from the isles of Kittim" denotes 
externals of worship-thus rituals-which have reference to the class of celestial things. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict 
Eber (Num. 24:24), where also "Kittim" denotes external worship, or rituals. Hence it is evident that in the internal sense by all these names are signified actual things [res], which actual things stand 
in their own regular order and connection. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1156</b></p><p><b>1156.</b>
'Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim' were just so many nations with whom such worship existed, and who mean just so many types of matters of doctrine which were forms of ritual, derived from the 
external worship existing with 'Javan'. This becomes clear from the following places in the Prophets: </p>
<p> Elishah is referred to in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail, 
that it might be to you an ensign; violet and purple from the islands of Elishah was your covering. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means people who possess celestial and spiritual riches, 
which are cognitions. 'Embroidered work from Egypt' stands for facts, and so for forms of ritual representative of spiritual things. 'Violet and purple from the islands of Elishah' stands for forms of 
ritual corresponding to internal worship, and so for representatives of celestial things. In this case Elishah is used in the genuine sense. </p>
<p>Tarshish is referred to in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will send survivors 
from them to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, islands far off. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre has been laid 
waste, so that there is no house for entering in. From the land of Kittim<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> it has been revealed to them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:1,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:1, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Tarshish is again referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:12</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2048:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 48:7</a>, 
where it stands for forms of ritual, that is, types of doctrinal teachings. </p>
<p>Kittim is referred to in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Pass over into the islands of Kittim and see, and into Arabia<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and examine thoroughly, 
if there has been such a thing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He said, You will no more exult, O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon; arise, pass over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Kittim' stands for forms of ritual. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Of oaks of Bashan they made your oars; your plank they made of ivory, a daughter of steps<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> from the isles of Kittim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre. Ships' planks or benches 'from the isles of Kittim' stands for the external expression of worship, and so for forms of ritual, which belong to the branch of celestial things. 
In Moses, </p>
<p>Ships from the coast of Kittim [will come]' and they will afflict Asshur, and they will afflict Eber. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:24</a>. </p>
<p>Here also 'Kittim' stands for external worship, that is, for forms 
of ritual. From this it becomes clear that all these names in the internal sense mean real things, which occur in their own connected sequence.

'Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim et Dodanim':  quod fuerint totidem gentes apud quas talis cultus et quod per eas significentur totidem doctrinalia, quae fuerunt ritualia, derivata a cultu externo apud Javan, 
constare potest ab his apud Prophetas locis; de Elishah apud Ezechielem, Byssus in acupictura ex Aegypto fuit expansio tua, ut esset tibi in signum:  hyacinthinum et purpura ex insulis Elishah fuit 
tegumentum tuum, xxvii 7; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro, per quam significantur qui possident divitias caelestes et spirituales seu cognitiones; 'acupictura ex Aegypto' pro scientificis, et sic pro ritualibus repraesentativis 
spiritualium; 'hyacinthinum et purpura ex insulis Elishah' pro ritualibus correspondentibus cultui interno, ita pro repraesentativis caelestium; hic in sensu genuino.  De Tarshish apud Esaiam, Mittam 
ex illis evasores ad gentes Tarshish, (x)Pul et Lud trahentes arcum; Tubal et Javan insulas longinquas, lxvi 19: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Ejulate naves Tarshishi, quia devastata est Tyrus, ut non 
sit domus pro intrando; e terra Kittim manifestum hoc eis, xxiii 1, 14; </p>
<p>et porro de Tarshish, Esai. lx 9; Jer. x 9; Ezech. xxvii 12; Ps. xlviii 8 [A.V. 7]; ubi pro ritualibus seu doctrinalibus.  De Kittim, 
apud Jeremiam, Transite in insulas Kittim, et videte; et in {1}Arabiam, et attendite probe, ...num factum sicut hoc, ii 10;  et apud (x)Esaiam, Dixit, Non addas amplius exsultare, oppressa virgo 
filia Zidonis; ad Kittim surge, transi, etiam ibi non quies tibi, xxiii 12; </p>
<p>ubi 'Kittim' pro ritualibus:  apud Ezechielem, Quercubus de Bashane fecerunt remos tuos, {2}asserem tuum fecerunt ebore, 
filiam gressuum, ex insulis Kittim, xxvii 6; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro; 'asser navis ex insulis Kittim' pro externis cultus, ita pro ritualibus, quae se referunt ad classem caelestium:  apud Mosen, Naves e litore 
Kittim, et affligent Asshurem, et affligent Eberum, Num. xxiv 24; </p>
<p>ubi etiam pro externo cultu seu pro ritualibus.  Inde constare potest quod per omnia haec nomina significentur res in sensu interno, 
quae res in sua serie sunt. @1 So Sch., Heb. has Kedar, as A.V. In 3268 S. has Kedar and states Arabia nominatur Kedar a filio Ishmaelis.$ @2 Lat. asser=beam, stake or pole, but R.V. has 'benches' 
(or 'deck,' in m.).  Heb.    (qeresh)=board.$  </p>
