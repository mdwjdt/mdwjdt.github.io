<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2937节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2937.</strong>“按着足额的价银”表藉着真理的救赎。这从“银”和“他可以按着足额的价银卖给我”或“按着足额的价银”的含义清楚可知：“银”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）；“他可以按着足额的价银卖给我”或“按着足额的价银”是指购买，在灵义上是指救赎。因为属灵之人被说成是“用银子买的”（参看<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节），也就是说，他们凭真理得救赎。其原因在于，他们被重生，也就是说，被引入良善所凭借的是信之真理。因为属灵之人不象属天之人那样具有对良善的直觉；相反，他们通过真理认识良善，此后又通过真理承认它。当他承认并相信后，在他看来，真理就变成良善，他也体验到它就是良善，并且这良善在本质上变得和他所具有的真理一样了。这就是为何属灵之人被说成是凭真理得救赎。然而，良善的品质并非从真理，而是从这品质的良善进入真理的流注生出和产生的。</p>

In full silver. That this signifies redemption through truth, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551); and from the signification of "let him give me in silver," or 
"for silver," as being to buy, and in the spiritual sense to redeem. That the spiritual are said to have been "bought with silver," may be seen above (n. 2048), that is, redeemed by truth. The reason 
of this is that they are regenerated, that is, are introduced to good, through the truth of faith; for the spiritual man has no perception of good, as the celestial man has; but truth is that by means 
of which he knows, and from which he afterwards acknowledges, that there is good; and when he acknowledges and believes, then it becomes good to him, and he is affected by it as good, which becomes 
such in quality as is the truth which he has. Hence it is that the spiritual are said to have been redeemed by means of truth. But still the quality of the good is not born and produced from truth, but 
from the influx of good into truth of that quality. </p>

'For the full price' means redemption by means of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, and from the meaning of 'let him give it to me in - that is, for - silver', 
as buying, and in the spiritual sense as redeeming. For spiritual people are called 'those bought with silver', see <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>; that is, they are redeemed by means of truth. The reason for this is that 
they are being regenerated, that is to say, are being initiated into good, by means of the truth of faith. For the spiritual man, unlike the celestial, does not have any perception of good. Instead 
he knows through truth, and after that acknowledges from truth, that which is good. And when he acknowledges and believes, truth to him becomes good and he experiences it as good whose essential nature 
is the same as the truth with him. This is why spiritual people are called those redeemed by means of truth. Yet the essential nature of the good is not born and produced from truth, but from the influx 
of good into truth of that nature. </p>

</p><b>2937.</b>
`In argento pleno':  quod significet redemptionem per verum, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551; {1}et a significatione `det mihi in argento' seu pro argento, quod sit 
emere, {2}et in sensu spirituali redimere:  quod spirituales dicantur `empti argento,' videatur n. 2048, hoc est, redempti per verum; causa inde est quia per verum fidei regenerantur, nempe introducuntur 
ad bonum; spiritualis enim homo nullam perceptionem boni habet ut caelestis, sed verum est per quod cognoscit, et dein ex quo agnoscit quod bonum sit, et cum agnoscit et credit, tunc fit id illi 
bonum, et afficitur illo ut bono, quod {3}tale fit, quale ei verum; inde est quod spirituales dicantur redempti per verum:  at usque qualitas boni non nascitur et producitur a vero, sed ab influxu boni 
in quale verum. @1 et petere ut daretur$  @2 at$  @3 i bonum$  </p>
