<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3147节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3147.</strong>“又拿水给他洗脚”表那里的洁净。这从“清洗的水”，或用水清洗和“脚”的含义清楚可知：“清洗的水”或用水清洗是指洁净，如下文所述；“脚”是指属世之物，或也可说，属世人中的事物（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>节）。在代表性教会，用水洗脚是一种礼仪，由此表示洗去属世人的不洁之物。属世人的不洁之物全都是那些属于我欲和物欲的事物。这些不洁之物被洗去后，良善与真理便流入进来，因为唯独这些不洁之物阻碍良善与真理从主流入。<br />良善不断从主流入，但当经由内在人或属灵人抵达外在人或属世人时，它在那里要么被败坏，要么被弹回，要么被窒息。不过，属于我欲和物欲的事物被除去后，良善便在那里被接受，并结出果实，因为此时人实践仁爱的行为。这一事实从多种考虑可以看出来，如当人处于不幸、悲伤和疾病状态时，属于外在人或属世人的事物只是沉寂下来，这人随即开始虔诚地思考，并意愿良善，也开始尽可能地实践敬虔的行为。不过，一旦这种状态改变，所有这些事也会改变。<br />在古教会，各种“洗”是表示这些事的符号；但在犹太教会，它们则成了代表形式。在古教会，各种“洗”是有意义的符号；而在犹太教会，它们则成了代表形式。这是因为古教会成员将仪式视为敬拜的某种外在行为，他们并不认为自己通过这种清洗就能洁净，而是相信通过洗去属世人的污秽才能洁净。如前所述，属世人的污秽就是属于我欲和物欲的事物。而犹太教会成员则认为自己通过这种洗就能洁净，既不知道，也不想知道所指是内在的洁净。<br />“洗”表示洗去那污秽，这清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />你们要洗濯、自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行，要止住作恶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.16.htm">1:16</a>）<br />显然，这里的“洗濯”表示使自己洁净，除掉邪恶。<br />主以审判之灵和清洗之灵，将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷的血从城当中涮净。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.3.htm">4:3</a>）<br />此处“将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷的血涮净”表从恶与假中洁净。耶利米书：<br />耶路撒冷啊，你当洗去心中的恶，使你可以得救。恶念存在你里面要到几时呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.14.htm">4:14</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />我用水洗你，洗净你身上的血，又用油抹你。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.9.htm">16:9</a>）；<br />这论及耶路撒冷，耶路撒冷在此表示古教会。“用水洗”表洁除虚假，“洗净血”表清除邪恶，“用油抹”表那时充满良善。诗篇：<br />求你洗净我的罪孽，并洁除我的罪！求你用牛膝草洁净我，我就干净；求你洗涤我，我就比雪更白。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.2.htm">51:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“洗涤”明显表示从恶及其假中洁净。<br />这些就是代表性教会中“洗”所表示的事。为了作代表，当他们变得不洁，并且需要洁净时，该教会就要求人们洗皮肤、手、脚，以及衣服。所有这些都表示属于属世人的事。同样为了作代表，铜造的洗濯盆，也就是说列王纪上（7:23-39）所提到的“铜海和十个铜盆”被安在圣殿的外面；还有亚伦和他儿子用来洗濯的铜盆被放在会幕和坛的中间，因而在会幕外面（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.18.htm">30:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.21.htm">21</a>）；它们也表示仅外在事物或属世之物需要被洁净。除非它们被洁净，也就是说，属于我欲和物欲的事物被除去，否则，属于对主和对邻之爱的内在事物绝无可能流入进来，如前所述。<br />为了更好地理解这些事，也就是说，外在事物需要被洁净，以善行，或也可说如今被称作信的果子的仁之良善为例来说明。这些都是外在事物，因为它们是仁爱的行为。若不除去那些属于我欲和物欲的事物，善行就是恶行。在除去这些事物之前所做的行为表面上看似良善，内里其实是邪恶。因为所做的这些行为要么为名，要么为利，要么为个人的荣耀，要么为回报。相应地，它们或是邀功的，或是虚伪的，因为属于我欲和物欲的事物使这些行为变得如此。不过，一旦除去这些恶，这些行为就变成良善，并且是仁之良善。也就是说，它们无关自我、这个世界、名声或回报，因而不是邀功或虚伪的。在这种情况下，属天之爱和属灵之爱便从主流入这些行为，并使它们变成行为上的爱与仁。与此同时，主还通过这些爱洁净属世人或外在人，将其整理成序，以便人相应地接受所流入的属天和属灵之物。<br />这从主给门徒洗脚时所教导的话非常清楚地看出来。如我们在约翰福音中读到：<br />然后，祂挨到西门彼得，彼得对他说，主啊，你洗我的脚吗？耶稣回答他说，我所做的，你如今不知道，后来必明白。彼得对祂说，你永不可洗我的脚！耶稣回答他说，我若不洗你，你就与我无分了。西门彼得对祂说，主啊，不单我的脚，还有手和头呢！耶稣对他说，凡洗过澡的人，只要把脚一洗，全身就干净了；你们是乾净的，然而不都是乾净的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.4.htm">13:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“凡洗过澡的人，只要把脚一洗，全身就干净了”表凡已被改造的人只需洁净属世之物，也就是说，将恶与假从他们身上除去。这时，一切事物就都被来自主的属灵之物的流注整理成序了。此外，“洗脚”是一种仁爱行为，意味着人不应老想着别人的邪恶；“洗脚”还是一种谦卑行为，意味着洁除别人身上如同身体污秽那样的邪恶。这也可从主的话明显看出来（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.12.htm">13:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.17.htm">17</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.37.htm">7:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.38.htm">38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.44.htm">44</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.46.htm">46</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.2.htm">11:2</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上25.41.htm">25:41</a>）。<br />谁都能看出，洗自己不是洁除人的恶与假，只是洗去附着在人身上的脏东西。然而，由于洗礼是教会所规定的仪式之一，故可知，它含有某种特定概念，即属灵的洗礼，也就是洁除内在附着于人身上的污秽。因此，凡教会中知道这些事，并思想心的洁净，也就是从属世人中除去我欲和物欲的邪恶，竭尽全力去实现的人会按照规定奉行作为外在敬拜的洗礼仪式。但在那些不知道，也不想知道这些事，反以为仅洗衣、洗皮肤、手和脚这样的仪式就会洁净他们，并且只要做了这些事，他们就可以继续过着贪婪、仇恨、报复、无情、残忍（所有这些都是属灵的污秽）的生活之人当中，举行仪式就是进行偶像崇拜。尽管如此，他们仍能通过这种仪式去作代表，并通过代表去展现教会的某种事物，从而在主到来之前，天堂与人类能有某种结合。然而，这种结合具有这样的特点：天堂对教会中人影响很小，或根本没有任何影响。<br />犹太人和以色列人是这样：他们根本不思想内在人，也不愿了解有关它的任何情况，因此对关系到死后生命的属天和属灵之物一无所知。为防止与天堂、因而与主的一切联系终止，他们与表示内在事物的外在仪式牢牢绑在一起。一般来说，他们的被掳和灾祸都是为了外在仪式因代表的缘故而被严格执行。正因如此，摩西要用水洗亚伦和他儿子，好让他们成圣（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.4.htm">29:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.12.htm">40:12</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.6.htm">8:6</a>）。亚伦和他儿子在进入会幕，或就近供职的祭坛之前，要洗水洗脚，免得死亡；并且这要作他们永远的定例（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.18.htm">30:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.30.htm">40:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.31.htm">31</a>）。穿圣服之前，亚伦要洗身（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.4.htm">16:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.24.htm">24</a>）。要用除罪水弹在利未人身上，以洁净他们；他们要用剃头刀刮全身，洗衣，从而洁净自己（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.6.htm">8:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.7.htm">7</a>）。凡吃动物尸体，哪怕是洁净动物，或被撕裂的尸体之人，都要用水洗衣洗澡，若不洗自己洗澡，他必担当自己的罪孽（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.15.htm">17:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.16.htm">16</a>）。凡摸了患漏症人的床，或坐那人所坐之物的，凡摸那人身体的，要用水洗衣洗澡，并且必不洁净到晚上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利15.5.htm">15:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利15.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利15.10.htm">10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利15.12.htm">12</a>等）。那放羊归与阿撒泻勒的人要洗身（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.26.htm">16:26</a>）。求洁净的麻风病人要洗衣，剃去毛发，用水洗澡，就洁净了（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.8.htm">14:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.9.htm">9</a>）。甚至不洁之人所摸的器皿本身也变得不洁，要放在水中，并且必不洁净到晚上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利11.32.htm">11:32</a>）。从所有这些律法可以看出，没有人通过洗礼的仪式而洁净内在事物，这种人只是因上述原因而代表灵性上纯洁或洁净的人。主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.1.htm">15:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.20.htm">20</a>）和马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.1.htm">7:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.23.htm">23</a>）非常明确地教导了这一点。</p>

And water to wash his feet. That this signifies purification there, is evident from the signification of "water for washing," or of washing with water, as being to purify (concerning which presently); 
and from the signification of "feet," as being natural things, or what is the same, the things in the natural man (see n. 2162). In the representative church it was customary to wash the feet with water, 
and thereby to signify that the unclean things of the natural man were washed away. The unclean things of the natural man are all those things which are of the love of self and of the love of the 
world; and when these unclean things have been washed away, then goods and truths flow in, for it is solely these unclean things that hinder the influx of good and truth from the Lord. [2] For good 
is continually flowing in from the Lord, but when it comes through the internal or spiritual man to his external or natural man, it is there either perverted, turned back, or suffocated. But when the 
things which are of the love of self and of the love of the world are removed, then good is received there and is made fruitful; for then man practices the works of charity. This is evident from many 
considerations; as when in misfortune, distress, and sickness, the things that belong to the external or natural man are merely lulled, the man forthwith begins to think piously and to will what is good, 
and also to practice works of piety insofar as he is able; but when the state is changed, there is a change also in all this. [3] These things were signified by the washings in the Ancient Church, 
and the same were represented in the Jewish Church, The reason why they were signified in the Ancient Church, but represented in the Jewish church, was that the man of the Ancient Church regarded the 
rite as a something external in worship, and did not believe that he was purified by that washing, but by the washing away of the impurities of the natural man, which as before said are the things 
which are of the love of self and of the world. But the man of the Jewish Church believed that he was purified by that washing; neither knowing nor desiring to know that the purification of the interiors 
was signified. [4] That by "washing" is signified a cleansing from the impurities referred to, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before Mine 
eyes, cease to do evil (Isa. 1:16); </p>
<p>where it is evident that to "wash themselves" means to make themselves pure and to put away evils. Again: </p>
<p>     When the Lord shall have washed away the filth 
of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, in the spirit of judgment and in the spirit of expurgation (Isa. 4:4); </p>
<p>where "washing away the filth of 
the daughters of Zion, and purging the blood of Jerusalem," denotes purifying from evils and falsities. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long 
shall the thoughts of thine iniquity lodge within thee? (Jer. 4:14). [5] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I washed thee with water, and I washed away thy bloods from upon thee, and anointed thee with oil (Jer. 
16:9); </p>
<p>concerning Jerusalem, by which is there meant the Ancient Church; "washing with waters" denotes purifying from falsities; "washing away bloods" denotes purging from evils; "anointing with oil" 
denotes filling then with good. In David: </p>
<p>     Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter 
than snow (Ps. 51:2, 7). Here "being washed" plainly denotes being purified from evils and their falsities. [6] These are the things that were signified by "washing" in the representative church; 
and it was commanded for the sake of the representation that when they had become unclean they should wash the skin, the hands, the feet, and also the garments, and should be cleansed; by all which things 
were signified those which are of the natural man. Lavers also, of brass, were placed outside the temple, namely, the brazen sea and the ten brazen lavers (1 Kings 7:23-39); and a laver of brass 
at which Aaron and his sons were to wash was placed between the tent of meeting and the altar; and thus outside the tent (Exod. 30:18, 19, 21); by which also was signified that only external or natural 
things were to be purified; for unless these have been purified, that is, unless the things that are of the love of self and of the world have been removed, the internal things which are of love to 
the Lord and toward the neighbor cannot possibly flow in, as before said. [7] For the better understanding of how these things are circumstanced, namely, that external things are to be purified, take 
as an example and illustration good works, or what is the same, the goods of charity which at this day are called the fruits of faith; these are external things, because they are the exercises of charity. 
Good works are evil works unless those things are removed which are of the love of self and of the world; for when works are done before these have been removed, they indeed appear good outwardly, 
but are inwardly evil; for they are done either for the sake of reputation, or for gain, or for the sake of one's honor, or for recompense, thus they are either self-meritorious* or hypocritical; for 
that which is of the love of self and the world causes the works to be such. But when these evils are removed, the works then become good; and they are goods of charity; that is, in them there is not 
regard to self, to the world, to reputation, to recompense; thus they are neither self-meritorious nor hypocritical; for then celestial love and spiritual love flow in from the Lord into the works 
and cause them to be love and charity in act; and then the Lord through these loves also purifies the natural or external man, and disposes it into order, so as to receive correspondently the celestial 
and spiritual things that flow in. [8] This is clearly evident from what the Lord taught when He washed the feet of the disciples, as we read in John: </p>
<p>Then cometh He to Simon Peter; and Peter saith 
unto Him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered 
him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that hath been washed, needeth not 
save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit; ye are clean already, but not all (John 13:4-17). "He that hath been washed, needeth not save to wash his feet" signifies that he who has been reformed, 
has need only to be cleansed as to natural things, that is, has need that evils and falsities should be removed from them; and then all things are disposed into order by the influx of spiritual things 
from the Lord. Moreover to wash the feet was an office of charity, as meaning not to reflect on the evils of another; and it was also an office of humility, as meaning to cleanse another from evils 
as from impurities; as also is evident from the Lord's words in the passage just quoted (verses 12-17; also Luke 7:37, 38, 44, 46; John 11:2; 1 Sam. 25:41). [9] Everybody can see that washing himself 
does not purify anyone from evils and falsities, but only from the impurities that cling to him; nevertheless, as washing was among the rites commanded in the church, it follows that it involves something 
special, namely, spiritual washing, that is, purification from the uncleannesses which inwardly adhere to man. Therefore they who knew these things in that church, and thought about the purification 
of the heart, or the removal of the evils of the love of self and of the love of the world from the natural man, and who endeavored to effect this with all diligence, observed the rite of washing 
as external worship according to commandment; but those who did not know this and did not desire to know it, but thought that the mere rite of washing their garments, skin, hands, and feet, would purify 
them, and that provided they did these things they might be allowed to live in avarice, hatreds, revenge, unmercifulness, and cruelties, which are spiritual impurity, practiced this rite as an idolatrous 
one. Nevertheless they could represent by it, and by representation exhibit something of the church, whereby there might be some conjunction of heaven with man before the Lord's advent; yet such 
conjunction as affected the man of the church little or not at all. [10] The Jews and Israelites were such that they had no thought about the internal man, nor willingness to know anything about 
it; thus none at all concerning celestial and spiritual things, relating to the life after death. But yet lest all communication with heaven and thus with the Lord should perish, they were bound to external 
rites, whereby internal things were signified. All their captivities and plagues were in general for the end that external rites might be strictly observed for the sake of the representation.  Hence 
then it was that Moses washed Aaron and his sons with water at the door of the tent, that they might be sanctified (Exod. 29:4; 40:12; Lev. 8:6); that Aaron and his sons were to wash their hands 
and feet before they entered into the tent of meeting and came near to the altar to minister, that they might not die; and that this was to be to them a statute forever (Exod. 30:18-21; 40:30-31); that 
Aaron was to wash his flesh before he put on the garments of ministry (Lev. 16:4, 24); that the Levites were to be purified by being sprinkled with the water of expiation; and that they were to cause 
a razor to pass over their flesh, and to wash their garments, and thus should be pure (Num. 8:6-7); that whoever should eat the carcass even of a clean beast, or one that was torn, should wash his 
garments, and bathe himself in water; and if he did not wash himself and bathe his flesh, he should bear his iniquity (Lev. 17:15-16); that whoever touched the bed of one affected with the flux, or who 
sat upon a vessel on which he had sat, and whoever touched his flesh, should wash his garments, and bathe himself with water, and should be unclean till the evening (Lev. 15:5-7, 10-12); that whoever 
let go the he-goat, as a scape-goat, should wash his flesh (Lev. 16:26); that when a leprous person was cleansed, he was to wash his garments, shave off all his hair, and wash himself with water, and 
he should be clean (Lev. 14:8, 9); nay, that the very vessels which were made unclean by the touch of things unclean, should be passed through water, and should be unclean until evening (Lev. 11:32). 
From these things it may be seen that no one was made clean or pure as to internal things by the rite of washing, but only represented one pure or spiritually clean, for the reason given above. That 
this is so, the Lord teaches plainly in Matthew (15:1-2, 20), and in Mark (7:1-23). * The words "merit," "to merit," and "meritorious," are used by Swedenborg in a bad sense, meaning self-merit, etc., 
except when applied to the Lord. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3147</b></p><p><b>3147.</b>
'And water to wash his feet' means purification there. This is clear from the meaning of 'water to wash' or 'washing with water' as purifying, dealt with below, and from the meaning of 'feet' as natural 
things, or what amounts to the same, those things that are in the natural man, dealt with in <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>. In the representative Church washing feet with water was a ceremonial act which meant washing away 
the filth of the natural man. The filth of the natural man is composed of all the things that belong to self-love and love of the world, and when such filth has been washed away goods and truths flow 
in, for that filth alone is what hinders the influx of good and truth from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For good is flowing in constantly from the Lord, but when by way of the internal or spiritual man it reaches 
the external or natural man it is either perverted there, or turned away, or stifled. But when indeed the things that belong to self-love and love of the world are removed, good is received there, 
and bears fruit there, since the person now performs the works of charity. This may become clear from many considerations, such as this: When the things that belong to the external or natural man are 
quiescent - as they are in times of ill- fortune, wretchedness, and sickness - a person instantly starts to become spiritually-minded and to will what is good, and also to perform acts of devotion insofar 
as he is able. But when that state alters, these things are altered too. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the Ancient Church 'washings' were signs meaning these things, and in the Jewish Church the same were representations. 
The reason why in the Ancient Church they were meaningful signs but in the Jewish Church representations was that members of the Ancient Church regarded that custom as some external act of worship. 
Nor did they believe that they were purified by that kind of washing but by a washing away of the filth of the natural man, which, as has been stated, is composed of the things that belong to self-love 
and love of the world. But the member of the Jewish Church did believe that he was purified by such washing, for he did not know, and did not wish to know, that the purifying of a person's interior 
self was meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That 'washing' means the washing away of that filth is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Wash yourselves; purify yourselves; remove the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to 
do evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%201:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 1:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is evident that 'washing themselves' means purifying themselves and removing evils. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
When the Lord will have washed the excrement of the daughters 
of Zion and washed away the blood of Jerusalem from its midst in a spirit of judgement and in a spirit of purging. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%204:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 4:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'washing the excrement of the daughters of Zion and washing away the 
blood of Jerusalem' stands for purifying from evils and falsities. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Wash your heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that you may be saved. How long will your iniquitous thoughts lodge 
within you? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I washed you with water, and washed away the blood from upon you, and anointed you with oil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Jerusalem, which is used here to 
mean the Ancient Church. 'Washing with water' stands for purifying from falsities, 'washing away the blood' for purging from evils, 'anointing with oil' for filling with good at that time. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Wash 
me from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. You will purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean; You will wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2051:2,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 51:2, 7</a>.

<p>'Being washed' plainly stands 
for being purified from evils and derivative falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 These were the things that were meant by 'washing' in the Representative Church. For the sake of the representation, when they had 
been made unclean and needed to be cleansed, people were commanded in that Church to wash the skin, hands, feet, and also their garments. All these meant things that belong to the natural man. Also for 
the sake of the representation, lavers made of bronze were placed outside the Temple - that is to say, 'the bronze sea and the ten bronze lavers' mentioned in <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 7:23-29; there was also the bronze 
laver from which Aaron and his sons were to wash themselves, placed between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and so outside the Tent of Meeting, Exod. 30:18, <a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a> - the meaning of which was that 
only external or natural things needed to be purified. And unless they have been purified, that is, unless things belonging to self-love and love of the world have been removed from them, internal 
things which belong to love to the Lord and towards the neighbour cannot possibly flow in, as stated above. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 To enable these matters to be understood more easily, that is to say, regarding the need 
for external things to be purified, let good works - or what amounts to the same, the goods of charity, which are at the present day called the fruits of faith, and which, since they are actions, 
are external - serve to exemplify and illustrate the point: Good works are bad works unless the things belonging to self-love and love of the world are removed. For until these have been removed works, 
when performed, are good to outward appearance but are inwardly bad. They are inwardly bad because they are done either for the sake of reputation, or for financial gain, or for improvement of one's 
position, or for reward. They are accordingly either merit-seeking or hypocritical, for the things that belong to self-love and love of the world cause those works to be such. But when indeed these evils 
are removed, works become good, and are the goods of charity. That is to say, they are done regardless of self, the world, reputation, or reward, and so are not merit-seeking or hypocritical, because 
in that case celestial love and spiritual love flow from the Lord into those works and cause them to be love and charity in action. And at the same time the Lord also purifies the natural or external 
man by means of those things and orders it so that that man receives correspondingly the celestial and spiritual things that flow in. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 This becomes quite clear from what the Lord taught when 
He washed the disciples' feet: In John, </p>
<p>He came to Simon Peter, who said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet? Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know 
afterwards. Peter said to Him, You will never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and head! 
Jesus said to him, He who is washed has no need except that his feet be washed, but is clean all over. Now you are clean, but not all of you. John 13:4-17. </p>
<p>'He who is washed has no need except 
that his feet be washed' means that anyone who has been reformed needs to be cleansed only in regard to natural things, that is, to have evils and falsities removed from them. For when that happens all 
is ordered by the influx of spiritual things from the Lord. Furthermore 'feet-washing' was an act of charity, meaning that one ought not to dwell on the evils of another person. It was also an act 
of humility, meaning the cleansing of another from evils, like filth from the body, as also becomes clear from the Lord's words in verses 12-17 of that chapter in John, and also in Luke 7:37, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="44.htm">44</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>; John 11:2; <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam. 25:41. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Anyone may see that washing himself does not purify a person from evils and falsities, only from the filth that clings to him. Yet because it belonged among the religious 
observances commanded in the Church it follows that it embodies some special idea, namely spiritual washing, which is purification from the filth that clings to man inwardly. Members of that Church 
therefore who knew these things and thought of purification of the heart, that is, the removal of the evils of self-love and love of the world from the natural man, and tried to achieve it with utmost 
zeal, practiced ritual washing as an external act of worship, as commanded. But among those who did not know and did not wish to know those things but who supposed that the mere ritual act of washing 
garments, skin, hands, and feet would purify them, and who supposed that provided they performed such rituals they would be allowed to continue leading lives of avarice, hatred, revenge, mercilessness, 
and cruelty - all of which constitute spiritual filth - the performance of the ritual was idolatrous. Nevertheless by means of that ritual they were still able to represent, and by means of the 
representation to display, some vestige of a Church, by means of which heaven was in a way joined to mankind prior to the Lord's Coming. But that conjunction was such that heaven had little or no influence 
at all on the member of that Church. </p>

<p><b>[10]</b>
 The Jews and Israelites were such that they did not think at all of the internal man, nor did they wish to know anything about the same. Thus they 
knew absolutely nothing about the celestial and spiritual things which belong to the life after death. Nevertheless to prevent the end of all communication with heaven and so with the Lord, they were 
bound to the performance of external observances by which internal things were meant. All their captivities and plagues were in general to the end that external observances might be duly carried out for 
the sake of the representation. It was for this reason that the following laws were given: </p>
<p> Moses was to wash Aaron and his sons with water at the tent door, to sanctify them. Exod. 29:4; 40:12; 
Lev. 8:6. </p>
<p>Aaron and his sons were to wash their hands and feet before entering the Tent of Meeting and approaching the Altar to minister, lest they died. This was to them a statute for ever. Exod. 
30:18-21; 40:30, <a href="31.htm">31</a>. </p>
<p>Before putting on his vestments Aaron was to wash his flesh. Lev. 16:4, <a href="24.htm">24</a>. </p>
<p>Levites were to be purified by sprinkling the water of expiation over them, passing a razor over 
their flesh, and washing their clothes - then they were pure. Num. 8:6, <a href="7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<p>Anyone who ate the carcass of a clean animal,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> or that which had been torn to pieces, was to wash his clothes and bathe himself 
with water, and if he did not wash himself and bathe his flesh he would bear his iniquity. Lev. 17:15, <a href="16.htm">16</a>. </p>
<p>Anyone who touched the bed of a person who had a discharge, or sat on a vessel on which 
that person had sat, and anyone who touched that person's flesh was to wash his clothes and to bathe himself with water, and be unclean until the evening. Lev. 15:5-7, <a href="10.htm">10</a>-1:and following verses. </p>
<p>The 
person who sent the goat away to Azazel was to wash his flesh. Lev. 16:26. </p>
<p>When a leper was to be cleansed he was to wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, wash himself in water, and then 
he would be clean. Lev. 14:8, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p>Even vessels themselves which had become unclean through contact with unclean persons were made to go through water and be unclean until the evening. Lev. 11:32. </p>
<p>From 
all these laws it may be seen that nobody was made clean or pure internally through ritual washing, but that such a person merely represented him who was pure or spiritually clean, for the reason 
stated above. The Lord teaches the same quite explicitly in Matt. 15:1-20; Mark 7:1-23.

`Et aquam ad lavandum pedes ejus': quod significet purificationem ibi, constat ex significatione `aquae ad lavandum' seu `lavare aqua' quod sit purificare, de qua sequitur; et a significatione `pedum' 
quod sint naturalia, seu quod idem, illa quae sunt in naturali homine, de qua n. 2162. In Ecclesia Repraesentativa sollemne fuit aqua `lavare pedes,' et per id significare quod sordes naturalis hominis 
abluerentur; sordes naturalis hominis sunt omnia illa quae sunt amoris sui et amoris mundi, quae sordes cum ablutae sunt, tunc bona et vera influunt, sunt enim unice illae quae impediunt influxum 
boni et veri a Domino; [2] bonum enim continue a Domino influit, sed cum per internum seu spiritualem hominem ad ejus externum seu naturalem venit, illud ibi vel pervertitur, vel reflectitur, vel suffocatur; 
at vero cum removentur illa quae amoris sui et mundi sunt, tunc bonum ibi recipitur, et ibi fructificatur, nam tunc homo opera charitatis exercet; ut constare a multis potest, ut cum modo sopiuntur 
illa quae sunt externi seu naturalis hominis, ut in infortuniis, miseriis et morbis, tunc homo ilico incipit pie cogitare et bonum velle, et quoque pietatis opera exercere quantum potest; at mutato 
statu etiam haec mutantur: [3] haec per `lavationes' significabantur in Ecclesia Antiqua; et eadem repraesentabantur in Ecclesia Judaica; quod illa in Ecclesia Antiqua significarentur, sed in Ecclesia 
Judaica repraesentarentur, erat quia homo Ecclesiae Antiquae spectabat illum ritum ut quoddam externum in cultu, nec credebat, quod per lavationem purificaretur, sed per ablutionem sordium naturalis 
hominis, quae, ut dictum, sunt illa quae sunt amoris sui et mundi; at homo Ecclesiae Judaicae credebat quod per lavationem purificaretur, nesciens nec scire volens quod significaretur purificatio 
interiorum.  [4] Quod per lavationem significetur ablutio a sordibus illis, constat apud Esaiam,           Lavate vos, purificate vos, removete malum operum      vestrorum a coram oculis Meis; cessate 
malum facere, i 16; </p>
<p>ubi `lavare se' quod sit purificare se et removere mala, patet: apud eundem,           Cum laverit Dominus excrementum filiarum Zionis, et      sanguines Hierosolymae abluerit 
e medio ejus, in spiritu      judicii, et in spiritu expurgationis, iv 4; </p>
<p>ubi `lavare excrementum filiarum Zionis, et sanguines Hierosolymae abluere' pro purificare a malis et falsis: apud Jeremiam,  
         Ablue a malitia cor tuum, Hierosolyma, propterea ut      salveris. Quamdiu commorabuntur in medio tui cogitationes      iniquitatis tuae? iv 14: </p>
<p>[5] apud Ezechielem,           Lavi 
te aquis, et ablui sanguines a super te, et unxi te      oleo, xvi 9; </p>
<p>de `Hierosolyma' per quam ibi intelligitur Ecclesia Antiqua; `lavare aquis' pro purificare a falsis, `abluere sanguines' pro purgare 
a malis, `ungere oleo' pro implere bono tunc: apud Davidem,           Lava me ab iniquitate mea, et a peccato meo munda me; </p>
<p>     expiabis me hyssopo, et mundabor, lavabis me, et prae nive     
 albus ero, Ps. li [4], 9 [A.V. 2, 7]; </p>
<p>[6] `lavari' manifeste pro purificari a malis et falsis inde. Haec erant quae significabantur per `lavare' in Ecclesia Repraesentativa; mandatum ibi repraesentationis 
causa ut lavarent cutem, manus, pedes, et quoque vestes, quando immundi facti ac mundarentur, per quae omnia significabantur illa quae naturalis hominis sunt; etiam lavacra, quae omnia, ponebantur 
extra Templum, nempe `mare aeneum, et labra decem aenea,' 1 Reg. vii 23-39; ac labrum aeris ex quo se lavarent Aharon et filii ejus, positum erat inter Tentorium conventus et Altare, ita quoque extra 
Tentorium Exod. xxx 18, 19, 21, quo etiam {1}significatum, quod solum externa seu naturalia purificarentur; quae nisi purificata sint, hoc est, inde remota quae amoris sui et mundi sunt, nusquam possunt 
interna quae sunt amoris in Dominum et erga proximum, influere, ut supra dictum; [7] ut `melius' sciatur quomodo haec se habeant, nempe quod externa purificanda sint, sint exemplo et illustrationi 
bona opera, seu quod idem, bona charitatis quae hodie fructus fidei vocantur, haec sunt externa quia exercitia; bona opera sunt mala opera nisi removeantur illa quae sunt amoris sui et mundi,  nam 
opera cum fiunt antequam haec remota sunt, apparent extus bona, sed sunt intus mala, fiunt enim vel propter famam, vel propter lucrum, vel propter sui honorem, vel propter remunerationem, {2}ita sunt 
vel meritoria vel hypocritica, illa enim quae sunt amoris sui et mundi faciunt opera illa talia; at vero cum removentur mala haec, tunc opera fiunt bona, ac sunt bona charitatis, nempe in illis non respectus 
sui, mundi, famae, remunerationis, ita {3}illa non meritoria nec hypocritica, influit enim tunc amor caelestis et amor spiritualis a Domino in opera, et faciunt haec ut sint amor et charitas 
actu; ac tunc Dominus per illa quoque purificat naturalem seu externum hominem, ac eum in ordinem disponit ut recipiat correspondenter caelestia et spiritualia quae influunt; [8] quod manifeste constare 
potest ab illis quae Dominus docuit, cum lavit pedes discipulorum; apud Johannem,           Venit ad Simonem Petrum, qui dicit Ipsi, Domine, Tune      meos lavas pedes? respondit Jesus et dixit illi, 
Quod Ego      facio, tu non scis adhuc, cognosces vero post haec; dicit Ipsi      Petrus, Non lavabis pedes meos in aeternum; respondit illi      Jesus, Si non lavero te, non habes partem Mecum; 
dicit Ipsi      Simon Petrus, Domine, non pedes meos tantum, sed et manus et      caput; dicit illi Jesus, Qui lotus est, non opus habet nisi ut      quoad pedes lavetur, sed mundus est totus; jam 
vos mundi      estis, non tamen omnes, xiii 4-17; </p>
<p>(m)'qui lotus est, non opus habet nisi ut quoad pedes lavetur' significat quod qui reformatus est, modo opus habeat mundari quoad naturalia, hoc 
est, ut inde removeantur mala et falsa, omnia tunc disponuntur in ordinem per influxum spiritualium a Domino(n): {4}praeterea `lavare pedes' erat charitatis, quod nempe non (x)reflecteret super mala alterius; 
et quoque erat humiliationis, quod nempe alterum a malis, quasi a sordibus, mundaret, ut quoque a Domini verbis ibi vers. 12-17 constare potest, etiam Luc. vii 37, 38, 44, 46; Joh. xi 2; 1 Sam. 
xxv 41. [9] Quisque videre potest quod lavare {5}se non aliquem purificet a malis et falsis, sed solum a sordibus quae eis adhaerent; at quia inter ritus in Ecclesia mandatos fuit, sequitur quod involvat 
aliquid {6}peculiare, nempe lavationem spiritualem, hoc est, purificationem ab illis sordibus quae intus adhaerent homini: qui itaque inter illos noverunt haec, et cogitarunt de purificatione cordis, 
seu remotione malorum amoris sui et mundi e naturali homini, et omni studio hoc conabantur facere, illi obierunt ritum lavationis ut cultum externum ex mandato; at qui non noverunt hoc, nec voluerunt 
nosse, sed cogitarunt quod solus ritus lavandi vestes, cutem, manus, pedes purificaret eos, et modo talia fecerint, liceret eis in avaritia, in odiis, vindictis, immisericordia, saevitiis, quae 
sunt sordes spirituales, vivere, illi ritum hunc coluerunt ut idololatricum; at usque per illum repraesentare potuerunt, et per repraesentationem aliquid Ecclesiae sistere per quod conjunctio aliqua 
esset caeli cum homine antequam venit Dominus, sed talis conjunctio ut hominem {7}ipsius Ecclesiae parum vel nihil afficeret; [10] Judaei et Israelitae tales erant ut nihil prorsus cogitarent de interno 
homine, nec aliquid de illo scire vellent, ita nihil prorsus de caelestibus et spiritualibus quae sunt vitae post mortem, sed usque ne periret omnis communicatio cum caelo, et sic cum Domino, obstringebantur 
ad ritus externos per quos significabantur interna; omnes illorum captivitates et plagae erant in genere ob illum finem, ut externa rite observarentur repraesentationis causa: inde nunc erat,  
         Quod Moses Aharonem et filios ejus ad ostium tentorii      lavaret aquis, ut sanctificarentur, Exod. xxix 4; xl 12; Lev.      viii 6; </p>
<p>          Quod Aharon et filii ejus lavarent manus 
et pedes,      antequam intrarent in tentorium conventus, et accederent ad      altare ad ministrandum, ut non morerentur, et quod hoc esset      illis statutum saeculi, Exod. xxx 18-21; xl 30, 31; </p>
<p> 
         Quod Aharon, antequam indueret vestes ministerii, lavaret      carnem suam, Lev. xvi 4, 24; </p>
<p>          Quod Levitae purificarentur, per quod aspergerentur aqua      expiationis, quodque 
transire facerent novaculam super carnem      suam, et lavarent vestes suas et sic puri essent, Num. viii 6,      7; </p>
<p>          Qui comederet cadaver bestiae mundae, aut discerptum,      quod lavaret 
vestes suas et ablueret se aquis; et si non      lavaverit se, et carnem suam abluerit, quod portaret      iniquitatem suam, Lev. xvii 15, 16; </p>
<p>          Qui tetigerit cubile fluxu affecti, aut 
qui sederit super      vase, super quo ille sederat, quique tetigerit carnem ejus,      lavaret vestes, et ablueret se aquis, et immundus esset ad      vesperam, Lev. xv 5-7, 10-12, seq.; </p>
<p>       
   Qui emisit {8}hircum in azazel, lavaret carnem suam, Lev. xvi 26; </p>
<p>          Cum mundatus esset leprosus, quod lavaret vestes, raderet      omnem pilum suum, et lavaret se aquis, ac mundus esset, 
Lev.      xiv 8, 9; </p>
<p>          Immo quod ipsa vasa quae immunda facta per contactum      immundorum, transigerentur per aquas, et immunda essent ad      vesperam, Lev. xi 32. Ex {9}his constare potest, 
quod nullus per ritum lavationis quoad interna mundus seu purus fieret, sed modo purum seu spiritualiter mundum repraesentaret, ob causam de qua supra; quod ita sit, Dominus manifeste docet apud
