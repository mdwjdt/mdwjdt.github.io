<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2258节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2258.</strong>“审判全地的岂不做公平的事吗”表神圣良善无法以真理与良善分离的方式这样做。这从“审判全地的”和“公平”的含义清楚可知，就内义而言，“审判全地的”表良善本身，真理就出自这良善。在代表性教会中，这也由祭司来代表，因为祭司同时也是审判官。祭司他们代表神圣良善，审判官代表神圣真理，但“审判全地的”则表示这二者，这从第一卷数处所解释的“地”的含义清楚可知。但在此处通过这教会的代表来证明这些事太过费时。然而，“公平”表真理，如前所示（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。从这些话的含义，同时从内义上的整个思路明显可知，“审判全地的岂不做公平的事吗”表神圣良善无法以真理与良善分离的方式这样做。<br />为了理解这些事，要知道，有两样事物构成整个天堂的秩序，并通过天堂而存在于整个宇宙，即良善与真理。良善是秩序的本质成分，它的一切事物是仁慈；真理是秩序的次要成分，它的一切事物是真理。神圣良善将所有人判归天堂，而神圣真理则将所有人罚入地狱。因此，若非主的仁慈，也就是良善的真正本质是永恒的，所有人（不管有多少）都会受到诅咒。这就是“神圣良善无法以真理与良善分离的方式这样做”这句话所表示的（对此，也可参看第一卷，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>节）。<br />然而，恶人被罚入地狱并非因为神圣良善与神圣真理分离，而是因为这个人与神圣良善分离。因为主绝不将任何人送入地狱，而是这个人将自己送入地狱，如前面数次说明的。而且，鉴于神圣良善与神圣真理是结合在一起的，要知道，若恶者不与善者分离，恶者就会伤害善者，并不断努力摧毁秩序。因为保护善者免受伤害也是仁慈的行为。这在世上的国度也一样，若恶人不受惩罚，整个国家就会充满罪恶，并因此灭亡。由于这个原因，国王和法官在惩罚罪恶，并将犯罪的人逐出社会时所显示的仁慈，比无故向这些人所显示的仁慈还要伟大。</p>

Shall not the Judge of all the earth do judgment? That this signifies that the Divine good cannot do this after the manner of truth separated from good, is evident from the signification of the "Judge 
of all the earth," as also from the signification of "judgment." The "Judge of all the earth," signifies in the internal sense the good itself from which comes truth; which also in the representative 
Church was represented by the priests who were at the same time judges; for as priests they represented the Divine good, and as judges the Divine truth; but the "Judge of all the earth" means both, 
and this from the signification of "earth," as explained in several places in volume 1. But to prove these things now from the representatives of that church would be too tedious. "Judgment," however, 
signifies truth (as shown above, n. 2235). From these significations, and at the same time from the series of things in the internal sense, it is evident that "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do 
judgment?" signifies that the Divine good cannot do this after the manner of truth separated from good. [2] In order to understand these things, be it known that there are two things which constitute 
the order of the universal heaven, and thence in the universe, namely, Good and Truth. Good is the essential of order, all the things of which are mercies. Truth is the secondary of order, all the things 
of which are truths. The Divine good adjudges all to heaven, but the Divine truth condemns all to hell; and therefore unless the Lord's Mercy, which is of good, were eternal, all men, however many, 
would be condemned. This is what is signified by the statement that the Divine good cannot do this after the manner of truth separated from good. (See also what is said concerning this in volume 1, 
n. 1728.) [3] That the evil are nevertheless condemned to hell, is not because the Divine good is separated from the Divine truth, but because the man separates himself from the Divine good. For the 
Lord in no case sends anyone down into hell, but the man sends himself, as has been already stated a number of times. In the following respect also the Divine good is conjoined with the Divine truth: 
that unless the evil were separated from the good, the evil would do harm to the good, and would be continually endeavoring to destroy order: thus that the good may not be harmed, is of Mercy. This 
stands just as in the kingdoms of the earth. If evils were not punished, the whole kingdom would be infected with evils, and so would perish; for which reason kings and judges show more mercy in punishing 
evils and in expelling from society those guilty of them, than by exercising in their behalf an unseasonable clemency. </p>

'Will not the Judge of the whole earth execute judgement?' means that Divine Good cannot effect this in the manner of truth separated from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the Judge of the whole 
earth', and also from the meaning of 'judgement'. 'The Judge of the whole earth' means in the internal sense good itself from which truth goes forth. This was also represented in the representative 
Church by the priests being at the same time judges. As priests they represented Divine Good, and as judges Divine Truth. But 'the Judge of the whole earth' means both, and this from the meaning of 
'the earth', dealt with in various places in Volume One. But to confirm these matters at this point from the representatives of that Church would take too long. 'Judgement' however means truth, as shown 
above in <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. From the meaning of these words, and at the same time from the train of thought in the internal sense, it becomes clear that 'will not the Judge of the whole earth execute judgement?' 
means that Divine Good cannot effect this in the manner of truth separated from good. </p>

 To understand these matters it should be recognized that there are two things which constitute the order 
of the whole of heaven and are from there present in the universe, namely good and truth. Good is the essential constituent of order, and all aspects of it are forms of mercy. Truth is the secondary constituent 
of order, and all its aspects are truths. Divine Good adjudges all people to heaven, but Divine Truth condemns them all to hell. Consequently if the Lord's mercy, which is the very nature of 
Good, were not eternal, all men - however many these may be - would be condemned. This is what is meant here by the statement that Divine Good cannot effect this thing in the manner of truth separated 
from good. See also what is stated on these matters in Volume One, in <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>. But the reason the evil are condemned to hell is not that Divine Good is separated from Divine Truth, but that man separates 
himself from Divine Good; for the Lord in no way sends anyone down to hell, but man sends himself down, as stated frequently already. Also, seeing that the Divine Good is joined to Divine Truth, it 
should be recognized that unless the evil were separated from the good, the evil would do harm to the good and would be constantly endeavouring to destroy order. Thus the prevention of the good from 
suffering harm is an act of mercy. It is the same in earthly kingdoms. If evils went unpunished a whole kingdom would be steeped in evils, and this being so it would perish. For that reason kings and 
judges are showing greater mercy when they punish evils and remove from society those who commit them than when they show undue leniency towards the same. </p>

Quod `num Judex totius terrae non faciet judicium' significet quod Divinum Bonum non possit secundum verum separatum a bono hoc facere, constat a significatione `Judicis totius terrae,' tum a significatione 
`judicii'; `Judex totius terrae' in sensu interno significat ipsum bonum ex quo verum, quod etiam repraesentabatur per sacerdotes qui simul judices fuerunt, in Ecclesia repraesentativa; illi 
ut `sacerdotes' repraesentabant Divinum Bonum, ac ut `judice Divinum Verum; at `judex totius terrae' utrumque, et hoc ex significatione `terrae,' de qua in Parte Prima passim; sed haec confirmare nunc 
ex repraesentativis illius Ecclesiae, prolixum nimis foret `judicium' autem significat verum, ut supra n. 2235 ostensum; e significatione horum, simul ac ex serie rerum in sensu interno constare potest 
quod `num Judex totius terrae non faciet judicium' significet quod Divinum Bonum non possit secundum verum separatum a bono hoc facere.  [2] Quomodo haec intelligenda sint, sciendum quod duo sint quae 
constituunt ordinem universi caeli, et inde in universo, nempe bonum et verum; bonum est essentiale ordinis, cujus omnia sunt misericordiae; verum est secundarium ordinis, cujus omnia sunt veritates; 
Divinum Bonum omnes judicat ad caelum; Divinum autem Verum omnes damnat ad infernum; quare nisi misericordia Domini aeterna foret, quae est Boni, omnes quotcumque sunt, homines damnat forent; id est 
quod significatur {1} per quod Divinum Bonum non possit secundum verum separatum a bono, hoc facere; videantur etiam quae de his in Parte Prima n. 1728: quod tamen mali damnati sint ac infernum, hoc 
non est ex eo quod Divinum Bonum sit separatum a Divino Vero, sed quia homo seipsum separat a Divino Bono; Dominus enim nusquam aliquem in infernum demittit, sed homo semet, ut aliquoties prius dictum: 
tum quoque in eo Divinum Bonum conjunctum est Divino Vero quod nisi separarentur mali a bonis, mali inferrent damnum bonis, et continue ordinem destruere conarentur; ita ne boni laedantur, est misericordiae: 
se habet hoc sicut in regnis terrae; nisi mala punirentur, totum regnum inficeretur malis et sic periret; quare apud reges et judices plus misericordiae est punire mala et eos e societate 
expellere quam intempestiva clementia pro iisdem uti. 	@1 i hic.$ </p>
