<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5297节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5297.</strong>“收存在各城里作食物”表诸如存在于属世心智内层中的那类事物。这从“食物”和“城”的含义清楚可知：“食物”是指一切有用的事物，因而是指真理与良善，如刚才所述（<a href="5293.htm">5293</a>节）；“城”是指属世心智的内层。就普遍意义而言，“城”表示教会的教义事物（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）；但就具体意义而言，“城”表示人的内层，就是教义事物，确切地说，被联结于良善的真理所存在的地方。因为人里面的真理与真理可以说形成一座城（参看<a href="3584.htm">3584</a>节）；这就是为何拥有教会在里面的人被称为“神的城”。“城”的含义与“家”（house）的相似。就普遍意义而言，“家”表示良善，但就具体意义而言，它表示一个人（<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>节），尤表他在良善和联结于良善的真理方面的心智（<a href="3538.htm">3538</a>，<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="5023.htm">5023</a>节）；一个家及其房间、周围建筑物和庭院就是一个最小形式的城。<br />在以赛亚书，属世心智的内层就由“城”来表示：<br />当那日，埃及地必有五城的人说迦南的方言，又指着万军之耶和华起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.18.htm">19:18</a>）<br />主在路加福音所设比喻中的“城”也表示内层中的良善与真理：<br />主人对那有用一锭银子赚了十锭银子的仆人说，好！良善的仆人，你既在最小的事上有忠心，可以有权柄管十座城。对赚了五锭银子的第二个说，你也可以管五座城。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.12.htm">19:12</a>及以后）<br />故此处“收存在各城里作食物并保管它”表示与良善联结的真理要储存在属世心智的内层中；当这些真理与良善已在那里被储存起来时，它们就被称为“余剩”。这些余剩就是人的实际属灵生命所在之处，每当有需要和渴望，也就是属灵的饥荒时，它们就是那给予一个人属灵滋养的。</p>

For food in the cities. That this signifies such things in the interiors of the natural mind, is evident from the signification of "food," as being all things that are of use, thus truths and goods (of 
which just above, n. 5293); and from the signification of "cities," as being the interiors of the natural mind. In the universal sense "cities" signify the doctrinal things of the church (see n. 402, 
2268, 2449, 2451, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493); but in an individual sense they signify the interiors of man where doctrinal things are, or rather where are truths conjoined with good. That the truths 
and goods in man form as it were a city, may be seen above (n. 3584); and hence that man himself in whom is the church is called the "city of God." The signification of a "city" is circumstanced 
as is that of a "house." In the universal sense a "house" signifies good, but in the individual sense it signifies a man (n. 3128), and specifically his mind as to the good and truth conjoined in it (n. 
3538, 4973, 5023); and a house with its apartments, outbuildings, and courts, is a city in the least form. [2] The interiors of the natural mind are signified by "cities" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>	In that day 
there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the lips of Canaan, and that swear to Jehovah Zebaoth (Isa. 19:18); </p>
<p>and the goods and truths in the interiors are signified by the "cities" 
in the Lord's parable in Luke: </p>
<p>	He said to him that by the pound had made ten pounds, Well done thou good servant; because thou hast been faithful in a very little, be thou over ten cities. And 
he said to the second, who had made five pounds, Be thou also over five cities (Luke 19:12 seq.). Here therefore by "heaping up food in the cities and guarding it," is signified that truths conjoined 
with good were to be stored up in the interiors of the natural mind; and when these truths and goods have been stored up there, they are called "remains," in which the veriest spiritual life of man consists, 
and from which he is spiritually nourished in every case of need and want, that is, in every spiritual famine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5297</b></p><p><b>5297.</b>
'Food in the cities' means such things present in the interior parts of the natural mind. This is clear from the meaning of 'food' as all things that have a useful purpose, dealt with just above in <a href="5293.htm">5293</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'cities' as the interior parts of the natural mind. In the universal sense 'cities' means matters of doctrine known to the Church, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4491.htm">4491</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, but in a particular sense it means the interior parts of a person where matters of doctrine exist, or rather where truths joined to good exist. For the forms of truth and good existing 
with a person form a city so to speak, see <a href="3584.htm">3584</a>, which is why a person who has the Church within him is called 'the city of God'. The meaning that 'a city' has is similar to the meaning that 'a house' 
has. In a universal sense 'a house' means good; in a particular sense however it means a person, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, and in a specific sense it means his mind so far as goodness and truth are joined together there, 
<a href="3538.htm">3538</a>, <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="5023.htm">5023</a>. Also a house with its rooms, surrounding buildings, and courtyards is a city in miniature. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The interior parts of the natural mind are meant by 'cities' in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On that 
day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt which speak in the lips of Canaan and swear to Jehovah Zebaoth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Both forms of good and of truth present in the interior parts are meant 
by 'cities' in the Lord's parable in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
He said to the one who used his mina to earn ten minas, Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful over a little, be over ten cities. And 
he said to the second who earned five minas, You also, be over five cities. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:11</a> 
</blockquote>
and following verses. </p>
<p>The recommendation here therefore that they should store up food in cities and should 
guard it means that truths joined to good were to be stored away in the interior parts of the natural mind. When these truths and forms of good have been stored away there they are called remnants. These 
remnants are where a person's actual spiritual life resides, and they are what a person is nourished by spiritually whenever need and desire, that is, whenever spiritual famine, arises. </p>

`Cibum in urbibus': quod significet talia in interioribus mentis naturalis, constat ex significatione `cibi' quod sint omnia quae usus, ita vera et bona, de qua mox supra n. 5293; et (e)ex significatione 
`urbium' quod sint interiora mentis naturalis; `urbes' in universali sensu significant doctrinalia Ecclesiae, videatur n. 402, 2268, (x)2449, 2451, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493, in singulari autem 
significant interiora hominis ubi doctrinalia sunt, seu potius ubi vera conjuncta {1}bono; quod vera et bona apud hominem forment quasi civitatem, videatur n. 3584, inde ipse homo in quo Ecclesia, 
vocatur civitas Dei; significatio `urbis' se habet sicut significatio domus, `domus' in universali sensu significat bonum, in singulari autem hominem, n. 3128, et in specie mentem ejus quoad bonum et 
verum ibi conjunctum, n. 3538, 4973, 5023, et domus cum suis conclavibus, aedificiis circum, et atriis, est civitas in minima forma. [2] Interiora mentis naturalis {2} significantur per `urbes' apud Esaiam, 
 In die illo erunt quinque urbes in terra Aegypti, loquentes labiis Canaanis, et jurantes Jehovae Zebaoth, xix 18; et bona et vera quae in interioribus, significantur per `urbes' in parabola Domini 
apud Lucam,   Dixit ei qui per minam lucratus est decem minas, Euge bone serve, quia super minimo fidelis fuisti, esto super decem urbes; et dixit alteri qui quinque minas lucratus, Tu quoque esto 
super quinque urbes, xix 12 seq.   (m)Hic itaque per quod {3}congerant cibum in urbibus et custodiant, significantur vera conjuncta bono, quod recondenda in interioribus mentis naturalis, quae vera 
et bona cum ibi recondita sunt, vocantur reliquiae, in quibus ipsissima vita spiritualis hominis consistit, et ex quibus homo spiritualiter nutritur in omni necessitate et indigentia, hoc est, in omni 
fame spirituali.(n)  @1 bonis$ @2 i etiam$ @3 congerent A I$  </p>
