<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10652节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10652</strong>.“他们的女儿随从他们的神，就行淫，使你的儿子也随从她们的神行淫”表以这种方式亵渎良善和真理。这从“行淫”、“他们的女儿”、“他们的神”和“使你的儿子也随从她们的神行淫”的含义清楚可知：“行淫”是指非法结合，如前所述（<a href="10648.htm">10648</a>节）；“他们的女儿”或那地居民的女儿，是指对邪恶的情感；“他们的神”是指属于对邪恶的情感、已经与真理结合的虚假，因为“他们的神”是指与以色列民族的儿子联姻的那地居民的女儿的神，如刚才所述（<a href="10651.htm">10651</a>节），这种结合就是对良善的亵渎；“使你的儿子也随从她们的神行淫”是指真理与虚假的结合，这是对真理的亵渎。“神”表示虚假（参看<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>e，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>，<a href="8867.htm">8867</a>节），“儿子”表示真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="9807.htm">9807</a>，<a href="10490.htm">10490</a>节）。<br />说这些事是因为，“为你的儿子娶那地居民的女儿”所表示的对邪恶的情感与真理的初次结合，还不构成亵渎；但第二次结合就构成亵渎，因为当邪恶被应用于真理，真理被应用于邪恶时（这种事是通过错误解释真理，并将它应用于邪恶，因而通过把这一个包裹在那一个里面而导致的），这种情况就会发生。真理由此不再是真理，而是被毁灭并亵渎。<br />“百姓与摩押的女儿行淫”也表示这种亵渎，对此，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />以色列人住在什亭，百姓与摩押女子行淫。她们叫百姓去赴她们的神的祭筵；百姓就吃了，向她们的神下拜。于是耶和华对摩西说，拿下百姓中所有的族长，为耶和华对着日头悬挂。百姓被击杀，遭瘟疫死的，有二万四千人。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.1.htm">25:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“摩押”表示那些玷污良善的人（<a href="2468.htm">2468</a>，<a href="8315.htm">8315</a>节）；“摩押的女儿”表示对这种邪恶的情感；“与她们行淫”表示亵渎；因此，刑罚是将百姓的族长对着太阳悬挂，以及处死二万四千人。因为世界的太阳表示自我之爱（<a href="10584.htm">10584</a>节）；“对着它悬挂”表示天上的良善被自我之爱彻底灭绝；“二万四千”表示整体上的一切真理和真理之良善，和“一万二千”意思一样（<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）；处死他们表示一切真理的灭绝。这就是亵渎者所遭遇的事。</p>

And his daughters commit whoredom after their gods, and make thy sons commit whoredom after their gods. That this signifies in this manner the profanation of good and of truth, is evident from the signification 
of "committing whoredom," as being unlawful conjunction (of which above, n. 10648); from the signification of "his daughters," or the daughters of the inhabitant of the land, as being the 
affections of evil; from the signification of "their gods," as being the falsities of the affections of evil conjoined with truths, for by "their gods" are meant the gods of the daughters of the inhabitant 
of the land conjoined with sons of the Israelitish nation (see just above at n. 10651), which conjunction is the profanation of good; and from the signification of "making thy sons commit whoredom 
after their gods," as being the conjunction of truth with falsities, which is the profanation of truth. (That "gods" denote falsities, see n. 4402, 4544, 7873, 8867; and that "sons" denote truths, 
n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 3373, 4257, 9807, 10490.) [2] These things are so said because the first conjunction of the affections of evil with truths, which is signified by "taking the daughters of the 
inhabitant of the land for thy sons," is not as yet profanation; but the second conjunction is profanation, because this takes place when evil is applied to truth, and truth to evil, which is done by 
means of a wrong interpretation of truth, and the application of it to evil, and thus by the insertion of the one into the other. From this, truth no longer remains truth; but is killed and profaned. [3] 
This profanation is also signified by "the whoredom of the people with the daughters of Moab," of which we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Israel settled in Shittim, where the people began to commit whoredom 
with the daughters of Moab, and they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people did eat, and bowed themselves down to their gods. Therefore Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the 
heads of the people, and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun. And the people were smitten; and there died from this plague twenty-four thousand (Num. 25:1, 2, 4, 5, 9). By "Moab" are signified 
those who adulterate goods (n. 2468, 8315); and by his "daughters," the affections of this evil; and by "whoredom with them," profanation; consequently the penalty was the hanging of the heads of the 
people before the sun, and the death of twenty-four thousand. For the sun of the world denotes the love of self (n. 10584); "hanging before it" denotes the total extinction of heavenly good; and "twenty-four 
thousand" denotes all the truths and goods of truth in the complex, in like manner as "twelve thousand" (n. 2089, 3913, 7973); their death denotes the extinction of all truths. This takes place 
with those who profane. </p>

'And their daughters go whoring after their gods, and they cause your sons to go whoring after their gods' means profanation thereby of goodness and truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'whoring' 
as being linked together unlawfully, dealt with above in <a href="10648.htm">10648</a>; from the meaning of 'their daughters', or the daughters of the inhabitants of the land, as affections for evil; from the meaning of 'their 
gods' as the falsities belonging to the affections for evil which have been linked to truths (for by 'their gods' the gods of the daughters of the inhabitants of the land linked in marriage to the 
sons of the Israelite nation should be understood, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10651.htm">10651</a>), and this linking is the profanation of good; and from the meaning of 'causing your sons to go whoring after 
their gods' as a linking of truth to falsities, which is the profanation of truth. For the meaning of 'gods' as falsities, see <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>(end), <a href="4544.htm">4544</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>, <a href="8867.htm">8867</a>; and for that of 'sons' as truths, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="4257.htm">4257</a>, <a href="9807.htm">9807</a>, <a href="10490.htm">10490</a>. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These matters are stated in this way because the first linking of the affections for evil to truths, meant by 'taking the daughters of the inhabitants of the land 
for your sons', does not as yet constitute profanation; but the second linking does constitute it, for this is brought about when evil is applied to truth and truth is applied to evil, which is done 
by misconstruing truth and applying it to evil, thus by incorporating one in the other. As a result truth ceases to be truth any longer; it is ruined and profaned. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Such profanation is also meant 
by the people's committing whoredom with the daughters of Moab, spoken of in Moses as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
Israel settled down in Shittim, where the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. 
And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods. Therefore Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the chiefs<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the people, and hang them up for 
Jehovah before the sun. And the people were struck down, and twenty-four thousand died from that plague. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2025:1-4,6,9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 25:1-4,6,9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Moab' means those who adulterate forms of good, see <a href="2468.htm">2468</a>, <a href="8315.htm">8315</a>, 'the daughters 
of Moab' affections for that evil, and 'committing whoredom with them' profanation. Consequently the punishment was the hanging up of the people's chiefs before the sun, and the death of twenty-four 
thousand. For 'the sun' of this world means self-love, <a href="10584.htm">10584</a>, and 'being hung up before it' the total extermination of heavenly good [by self-love]. And 'twenty-four thousand' means all forms of 
truth and the good of truth in their entirety, the same as 'twelve thousand', <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, and 'the death' of that number of people the extermination of all truths. This is what happens to profaners.

`Et scortentur filiae ejus post deos earum, et scortari faciant filios tuos post deos earum':  quod significet sic profanationem boni et veri, constat ex significatione `scortari' quod sit illegitima 
conjunctio, de qua supra n. 10648, ex significatione `filiarum ejus' seu (x)habitatoris terrae, quod sint affectiones mali, {1}ex significatione `deorum earum' quod sint falsa affectionum mali conjunctarum 
veris, nam per `deos earum' intelliguntur dii filiarum habitatoris terrae conjunctarum cum filiis gentis Israeliticae, de quibus mox supra n. 10651; quae conjunctio est profanatio boni; et ex 
significatione `scortari facere filios tuos post deos earum' quod sit conjunctio veri cum falsis, quae est profanatio veri; quod `dii' sint falsa, videatur n. 4402 fin., 4544, 7873, 8867, et quod `filii' 
sint vera, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 3373, 4257, (x)9807, 10490.  Haec ita dicuntur quia prima conjunctio affectionum mali cum veris quae significatur per `accipere de filiabus habitatoris terrae filiis 
tuis' nondum est profanatio {2}; ast altera conjunctio est profanatio, {3}haec enim fit cum malum applicatur vero ac verum malo, quod fit per sinistram interpretationem veri et applicationem ad malum, 
et sic per insertionem unius in alterum; inde verum non amplius manet verum, {4}sed mortificatur et profanatur.  Haec profanatio etiam significatur per scortationem populi cum filiabus Moabi, de 
qua ita apud Moschen, 	Consedit Israel in Schittim, ubi coepit populus scortari cum filiabus Moabi; et vocarunt populum ad sacrificia deorum earum, et comedit populus, et incurvavit se diis earum.  
Ideo dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Sume omnia capita populi, et suspende ea Jehovae coram sole:  et populus percussus est, et ex plaga illa mortui sunt quattuor et viginti milia, Num. xxv 1-3, [4,] 6, 9; </p>
<p>per 
`Moabum' significantur qui adulterant bona, {5} n. 2468, 8315, et per `filias ejus' affectiones illius mali, et per `scortationem cum illis' profanatio; inde poena fuit suspensio capitum populi coram 
sole et {6}mors viginti quattuor milium, `sol mundi' enim est amor sui, n. 10584, `suspensio coram illo' est totalis exstinctio boni caelestis, et `viginti quattuor milia' sunt omnia vera et bona 
veri in complexu, similiter ac duodecim milia, n. 2089, 3913, 7973, `mors eorum' est exstinctio omnium verorum; hoc fit apud illos qui profanant. @1 i et$ @2 i est modo receptio veri in parte intellectuali,
