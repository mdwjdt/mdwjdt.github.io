<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2950节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2950.</strong>“亚伯拉罕就在那地的人民面前下拜”表主因那些属于新的属灵教会之人的善意而喜悦。这从“下拜”和“那地的人民”的含义，以及“亚伯拉罕”的代表清楚可知：“下拜”在此和前面一样，是指感到喜悦（<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>节）；“亚伯拉罕”是指主，如前面频繁所述；“那地的人民”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，对此，参看前文（<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>节），那里有相同的话。不过，在那里，经上说的是“亚伯拉罕向当地的百姓赫之子下拜”（23:7）；之所以加上“赫之子”这个词，是因为所指的是最初被引入（真理）的教会成员，他们也由“（我）民的人”（sons of the people）来表示（参看<a href="2947.htm">2947</a>节）。但本节所指的是那些正取得进展的人，故经上只是简单地说“那地的人民”（people of the land），而没有加上“赫之子”（sons of Heth）。前一节的意思是主因被友善地接受而喜悦，本节的意思是祂因他们的善意而喜悦。接受首先到来，是因为接受是理解力的活动；善意（goodwill）随后到来，是因为善意是意愿的活动（参看<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）。</p>

Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land. That this signifies the Lord's joy on account of the good will of those who were of the new spiritual church, is evident from the signification of 
"bowing himself," here being to rejoice (as also above, n. 2927), from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord (concerning which quite often above); and from the signification of the "people 
of the land," as being those who are of the spiritual church, concerning which see above (n. 2928), where the same words occur; but it is there said that "he bowed himself to the people of the land, 
to the sons of Heth" (verse 7). The reason why the sons of Heth also are mentioned there, is that there those of the church are signified who are beginning to be initiated, who are also signified by the 
"sons of the people" (see n. 2947); but here those are meant who are progressing, and therefore it is simply said the "people of the land," without the addition of the "sons of Heth;" and in the former 
passage there is signified joy on account of their kind reception, but here because of their good will. Reception comes first, because it is of the understanding; good will comes afterwards, because 
it is of the will (see n. 2954). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2950</b></p><p><b>2950.</b>
'Abraham bowed before the people of the land' means the Lord's joy at the goodwill of those who belonged to the new spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'bowing' here as feeling joy, as 
also above in <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord, often dealt with already, and from the meaning of 'the people of the land' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with 
above in <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, where the same words occur. But there it is said that 'he bowed to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth', verse 7; and the reason why the expression 'the sons of Heth' is added 
there is that members of the Church who are first introduced [to truth] are meant, as is also meant by 'the sons of the people', <a href="2947.htm">2947</a>. The present verse however refers to those who are making progress, 
and therefore simply 'the people of the land' is used without the addition of 'the sons of Heth'. The previous verse meant His joy at being received kindly, the present His joy at their goodwill. 
Reception comes first because it is an activity of the understanding, goodwill after because it is an activity of the will, see <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>. </p>

`Incurvavit se Abraham coram populo terrae':  quod significet gaudium Domini ob benevolentiam illorum qui e nova Ecclesia spirituali, constat a significatione `incurvare se' quod hic sit gaudere, ut 
quoque supra n. 2927; a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, de qua saepius prius; et a significatione `populi terrae' quod sint illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua supra n. 2928, ubi eadem 
verba; sed ibi `incurvavit se populo terrae filiis Heth,' vers. 7; quod `filii Heth' ibi etiam dicantur, est quia illi ab Ecclesia ibi significantur, qui primum initiantur, ut quoque per filios populi,' 
n. 2947; hic autem illi qui in progressione sunt, quare simpliciter  `populus terrae' absque adjectione filiorum Heth dicitur; et ibi significatur gaudium propter benignam receptionem, hic ob benevolentiam, 
receptio est primum quia intellectus, benevolentia est sequens quia {1}voluntatis, videatur n. 2954. @1 A i apparently est$  </p>
