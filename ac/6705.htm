<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6705节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6705.</strong>古人将邻舍分门别类，并照着赋予世间表面看最需要帮助之人的名称而命名各个类别。他们还教导当如何向这一类的邻舍、那一类的邻舍行仁爱。他们以这种方式组织教义，并按照这些教义来规范自己的生活。因此，他们的教会教义包含了生活的准则，他们根据这些教义就能看出这个或那个教会成员是哪种人，具有何种品质。他们将其中的每个人都称为自己的“弟兄”，但这个词却照着这个人行仁爱的方式而具有不同的内义，即他是出于真正的教会教义，还是出于他改动后的教义而行仁爱。事实上，由于人人都希望显得无可指摘，所以他会竭力证明自己的生活方式是正当的，并为此拿出体现在宗教教义中的律法，或通过解释，或通过改动它们而支持自己。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6705</b></p><p><b>6705.</b>
The ancients reduced the neighbor into classes, and named each class according to the names of those who in the world appear to be especially in need; and they taught how charity was to be exercised 
toward those who were in one class, and how toward those in another; and in this way they reduced the doctrine, and the life according to it, into order. Hence the doctrine of their church contained the 
laws of life, and hence they saw of what quality was this or that man of the church whom they called "brother," but with a distinction in the internal sense in accordance with his exercise of charity 
from the genuine doctrine of the church, or from the doctrine as changed by himself; for as everyone desires to appear blameless, he defends his own life, and therefore either explains or changes the 
laws of doctrine in his own favor. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6705</b></p><p><b>6705.</b>
The ancients divided the neighbour into different categories, giving each category one of the names that describe those in the world who are plainly in the greatest need of help. They also taught how 
charity should be exercised towards those belonging to one category and towards those belonging to another. In this way they organized their teachings; and they regulated their lives in accordance with 
those teachings. Consequently the teachings of their Church contained rules for life, and from those teachings they saw what kind of person this or that member of the Church was. They called each of 
these their brother, though the word had different inner meanings according to the way that person exercised charity - whether he was directed by the genuine teachings of the Church or by such teachings 
after he had altered them. For since everyone wishes to appear above reproach, he strives to justify the way he lives and for that reason brings the laws embodied in religious teaching to support 
himself, either by the way he construes them or by changing them. </p>

</p><b>6705.</b>
Antiqui proximum redegerunt in {1} classes, et unamquamvis classem nominaverunt secundum nomina (c)eorum qui apparent in mundo prae aliis opitulandi; et docuerunt quomodo charitas exercenda esset erga 
illos qui in una classe et erga illos qui in altera; et sic in ordinem redegerunt doctrinam, et secundum illam redegerunt vitam; inde doctrina Ecclesiae illorum continebat leges vitae; et inde videbant 
qualis unus et alter esset homo Ecclesiae, quem vocabant fratrem, sed cum discrimine in sensu interno secundum exercitia charitatis ex genuina Ecclesiae doctrina, aut ex doctrina immutata a se; quisque 
enim quia vult apparere inculpatus, vitam suam defendit, et ideo leges doctrinae in sui favorem vel explicat vel immutat. </p>
