<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8212节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8212.</strong>“耶和华眺望埃及人的营”表神性流注从祂那里伸向那些正企图通过虚假施暴的人。这从“眺望”和“埃及人的营”的含义清楚可知。“眺望”当论及耶和华时，是指其流注的延伸；很明显，主眺望某人表示流注，因为那时祂使自己同在，将对良善和真理的觉知赋予那些处于来自祂自己的源于良善的真理，这一切通过流注实现；这就是为何当天使看某人时，他们便将在其生活中占导地位的情感注入他。“埃及人的营”是指邪恶所生的虚假（<a href="8193.htm">8193</a>，<a href="8196.htm">8196</a>节）；由于那时那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人正在追袭以色列人，所以也表示通过虚假施暴的企图（<a href="8208.htm">8208</a>节）。</p>

And Jehovah looked forth to the camp of the Egyptians. That this signifies the extension thence of Divine influx toward those who were endeavoring to inflict violence by means of falsities, is evident 
from the signification of "looking forth," when predicated of Jehovah, as being the extension of His influx; for it is evident that the Lord's looking forth to anyone denotes influx, because He then 
presents Himself as present, and gives a perception of good and truth to those who are in truth from good from Himself, which is done by means of influx. Hence it is that when the angels look at anyone 
they pour into him the affection that belongs to their life. And from the signification of "the camp of the Egyptians," as being falsities from evil (n. 8193, 8196); and because they who were in falsities 
from evil then pursued the sons of Israel, there is also signified the endeavor to inflict violence by means of falsities (n. 8208). </p>

'That Jehovah looked out onto the camp of the Egyptians' means Divine influx reaching out from Him in the direction of those who were attempting to do violence by means of falsities. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'looking out', when it has reference to Jehovah, as influx reaching out from Him (for by the Lord's looking out onto someone His flowing in is clearly meant, since He makes Himself present 
at that time and imparts a perception of what is good and true to those who are guided by truth springing from good that comes from Him, which is effected by means of influx; and this is why, when 
angels look at someone, they pour into him the affection that holds sway in their lives); and from the meaning of 'the camp of the Egyptians' as falsities arising from evil, dealt with in <a href="8193.htm">8193</a>, <a href="8196.htm">8196</a>. 
And since at that time those who were steeped in falsities arising from evil were pursuing the children of Israel the attempt to use force by means of falsities is also meant, <a href="8208.htm">8208</a>. </p>

`Et prospexit Jehovah ad castra Aegyptiorum': quod significet extensionem inde influxus Divini versus illos qui per falsa violentiam inferre conabantur, constat ex significatione `prospicere' cum praedicatur 
de Jehovah, quod sit extensio influxus Ipsius; quod enim `Dominus prospiciat ad aliquem' sit influere, patet, nam tunc praesentem Se sistit, et dat perceptionem boni et veri illis qui in vero 
{1}ex bono ex Ipso sunt, quod fit per influxum; (m)inde est, cum angeli inspiciunt in aliquem, quod infundant {2}in illum affectionem quae vitae illorum est;(n) et ex significatione `castrorum Aegyptiorum' 
quod sint {3}falsa ex malo, de qua n. 8193, 8196; et quia tunc illi qui in falsis ex malo erant (x)persequebantur filios Israelis, significatur etiam conatus per falsa violentiam inferendi, n.
