<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3110.</strong>“说，你是谁的女儿”表关于纯真的进一步调查。这从“你是谁的女儿”这个问题清楚可知。“你是谁的女儿”是指调查，在此是指进一步的调查，这从前面所述（<a href="3088.htm">3088</a>，<a href="3101.htm">3101</a>节）明显可知。这次调查的是纯真，这从“少女”的含义明显看出来，因为“少女”是指含有纯真的情感（参看<a href="3067.htm">3067</a>节）。诚然，本节没有出现“少女”一词，但鉴于前面（24:14，16）利百加被称为少女，并且此处这个问题是向她提出来的，故这里的“你”无非表示少女。<br />至于此处所论述的主题本身，也就是说，真理在被引入良善，然后与其联结之前，要接受调查，以查看它含有什么样的纯真，接着查看它含有什么样的仁爱。对不了解这个主题的人来说，这必然显得很奇怪。然而，要叫这些人知道，当真理要被引入良善并与其联结时，每个人里面都会有一次最细致的彻底调查，就是诸如超出所有人想像的那类调查。除了完美的真理外，绝不允许任何东西进入完善的良善。当有别的事物，而非完美的真理靠近时，该事物不会与完美的良善联结，而是与某种本身并非良善，只是看似良善的良善联结。若靠近的是虚假，良善就会退至内部，虚假便从外在与某种它视之为良善的邪恶联结。<br />这种神性安排由主藉着灵人和天使实现，并且在世上是一个深藏的秘密，但在来世是众所周知的。此外，凡具有正常理智的人都能知道这一点，至少能够理解。因为邪恶与虚假一起构成地狱，并从地狱流入；而良善与真理一起构成天堂，并从主经由天堂流入。既如此，那么邪恶与真理地狱与天堂那样不可能联结在一起。因此，有一个微妙到谁也无法相信的平衡被运用在这些事上。这就是调查的意义。</p>

He said, Whose daughter art thou? That this signifies further exploration concerning innocence, is evident from the question, "Whose daughter art thou?" as being exploration; that here it is further 
exploration, is evident from what has been said above (n. 3088, 3101). That it was exploration concerning innocence, is evident from the signification of a damsel, as being an affection in which is innocence 
(see n. 3067). In this verse indeed the word "damsel" is not found; but seeing that above (in verses 14 and 16) Rebekah is called a  and the question is here addressed to her, therefore "thou" 
here means nothing else than damsel.  [2] As regards the thing itself here treated of, namely, that truth was explored as to what innocence it had, and then also as to what charity, before it was initiated 
into good and conjoined with it, this cannot but appear wonderful to those who have no knowledge of the subject; but still let them know that in regard to the initiation and conjunction of truth 
with good in every man there is the most exquisite exploration, and such as surpasses all belief. To the veriest good there is never admitted anything but the veriest truth; for when anything not so 
true approaches, it does not conjoin itself with good itself, but with some good that in itself is not good, but appears as good; if falsity approaches, the good withdraws itself inward, and the falsity 
conjoins itself outwardly with some evil which it believes to be good. [3] This Divine disposal is effected by the Lord, spirits and angels being the mediums; and in this world it is very secret, 
but it is perfectly well known in the other. Moreover everyone who is of sound reason is able to know it, or at least to have some apprehension of it; for evil and falsity together are hell, and flow 
in from hell; whereas good and truth together are heaven, and also flow in through heaven from the Lord; and since this is so, evil and truth can no more be joined together than can hell and heaven; 
wherefore there is a more exquisite balance applied in these things than it is possible for anyone to believe; and this is what is meant by exploration. </p>

'He said, Whose daughter are you?' means further investigation concerning innocence. This is clear from the question 'whose daughter?' as an investigation, a further investigation in this case, as is 
evident from what has been stated already in <a href="3088.htm">3088</a> and <a href="3101.htm">3101</a>. Its being an investigation concerning innocence that is meant is clear from the meaning of 'a girl' as affection that has innocence within 
it, dealt with in <a href="3067.htm">3067</a>. Here, it is true, the word 'girl' is not used, but because Rebekah is called 'a girl' in verses 14 and <a href="16.htm">16</a> above and she is the one to whom the question is addressed here, nothing 
else is meant here by 'you' than the girl. As for the subject itself - namely that truth was investigated to see what innocence it held within it, and shortly after that what charity, before it was 
introduced into good and then joined to it - this must inevitably seem extraordinary to those who have no knowledge of the matter. However let such persons recognize that an absolutely thorough investigation 
occurs in everyone when truth is to be introduced into and joined to good, an investigation which is such that it goes far beyond the full extent of his belief. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 None but perfect truth 
is ever allowed to be with perfect good. When anything less than perfect truth approaches, this does not join itself to perfect good but to some variety of good that is not in itself good yet seems as 
if it were good. If falsity approaches, the good retires to an inward position and the falsity joins itself outwardly to some evil which it believes to be good. This Divine ordering is effected by the 
Lord by means of spirits and angels, and is completely hidden in this world, but fully known in the next. Anyone also of sound reason is able to know this and at least to comprehend it. For evil and 
falsity constitute hell and flow in from hell, whereas good and truth constitute heaven, and also flow in by way of heaven from the Lord. This being so, evil and truth can no more be joined together 
than hell to heaven. For this reason a more delicate balance is preserved in these matters than anyone can possibly believe. This then is what is meant by investigation. </p>

</p><b>3110.</b>
`Dixit, Filia cujus tu?' quod significet explorationem ulteriorem de innocentia, constat ex interrogatione `cujus filia' quod sit exploratio, hic quod ulterior, patet ab illis quae prius n. 3088 et 
3101; quod de innocentia, constat ex significatione `puellae' quod sit affectio in qua innocentia, de qua n. 3067; hic quidem non puella nominatur, sed quia supra vers. 14 et 16 Rebecca vocatur puella 
et ad illam hic interrogatio, non aliud quam puella per `tu' hic significatur. Quod ipsam rem attinet, nempe quod verum exploratum sit qua innocentia esset et mox quoque qua charitate, antequam initiatum 
bono et conjunctum ei, non potest quin mirabile appareat illis qui nullam ejus rei cognitionem habent; sed usque sciant quod circa initiationem et conjunctionem veri cum bono apud unumquemvis hominem 
exquisitissima exploratio sit, ac talis ut excedat omnem ejus fidem; [2] ad ipsissimum bonum nusquam admittitur aliquid nisi ipsissimum verum; cum aliquid non ita verum alluit, non conjungit se cum 
ipso bono, sed cum aliquo bono quod in se bonum non est, sed apparet sicut bonum; si falsum alluit, recipit se bonum introrsum, et se extrinsecus conjungit cum aliquo malo quod bonum credit; haec dispositio 
Divina fit a Domino mediis spiritibus et angelis, et est arcanissima in hoc mundo sed notissima in altero; quisque etiam qui sanae rationis est, id potest scire, ad minimum capere; malum enim 
et falsum est infernum ac influit ab inferno; bonum et verum autem est caelum, etiam per caelum influit a Domino; quia ita est, malum et verum non magis possunt conjungi quam infernum et caelum; quapropter 
exquisitior trutina in his est quam usquam aliquis credere potest; hoc nunc est quod intelligitur per explorationem. </p>
