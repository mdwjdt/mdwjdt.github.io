<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1195节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1195.</strong>前面（10:6）已说明，“麦西”或埃及是指知识；“路低人、亚拿米人、利哈比人、拿弗土希人”是指仅以知识术语存在的众多仪式。这从刚才所述清楚可知。那些通过理论探究属灵和属天的事物，并由此为自己制造敬拜形式的人就被说成具有仅以知识术语存在的仪式。这种敬拜的仪式因出于理论知识，故被称为知识仪式，其中没有任何属灵和属天之物，因为它们源于自我。埃及的偶像，以及它的巫术由此而来。这就是那些人的仪式的来源，故他们完全拒绝、甚至厌恶和憎恨古教会的仪式，这从经上所说（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.32.htm">43:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.34.htm">46:34</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.22.htm">8:22</a>）明显可知。由于所表示的是这些事物，故他们被说成是从麦西或埃及，即从知识生的。还由于他们的知识多种多样，故所衍生的仪式也各不相同。这些多样性一般由众多民族来表示。路低人或路德人就表这类事物，这一点清楚可见于耶利米书：<br />埃及像尼罗河涨发，像江河的水翻腾；他说，我要涨发遮盖遍地，我要毁灭城邑和其中的居民，马匹上去吧！车辆急行吧！勇士，就是手拿盾牌的古实人和吕彼亚人，并拉弓的路德族，都出去吧！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.8.htm">46:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“埃及的江河”是指多种多样的虚假知识；“涨发遮盖遍地”是指藉着知识进入属于教会或信的事物；“毁灭城邑”就是毁灭真理；“古实人和吕彼亚人”是认知；“路德族”是指上述知识的仪式；“拉弓”就是推理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1195.</strong> The fact that Mizraim (Egypt) means secular learning was demonstrated at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_6" target=_top>6</a> of this chapter. The fact that the Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, mean the respective types of ritual, which are merely secular, can be seen from the remarks directly above.<br />Ritual that is merely secular is attributed to people who use shallow logic to investigate spiritual and heavenly topics and manufacture a style of worship for themselves out of this. Because the ritual involved in this type of worship develops out of logic and fact, it is called secular. It has nothing spiritual or heavenly inside it, because it comes from human selfhood. This was the source of Egyptian idols and of the magical arts. Since this was the origin of those people's ritual, they completely rejected the rites of the ancient church. In fact they felt disgust and loathing for those rites, as indicated in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195/bible_king-james-version_genesis_43_32" target=_top>Genesis 43:32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195/bible_king-james-version_genesis_46_34" target=_top>46:34</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195/bible_king-james-version_exodus_8_26" target=_top>Exodus 8:26</a>. Because these are the things symbolized, those people are said to have been fathered by Mizraim, or Egypt — that is, by secular knowledge. And because they had many different kinds of knowledge, the ritual that sprang from it also came to be of many different types. The general varieties are symbolized by the respective nations.<br />The fact that the Ludim, or Lydians,{*1} have such a meaning can be seen in Jeremiah:<br />Egypt rises like a river, and like rivers its waters churn. And it has said, "I will go up; I will blanket the land; I will destroy the city and those living in it." Go up, horses; run mad, chariots; and let your mighty men march out, Cush and Put, as you grasp your shield, and Lydians as you grasp — as you bend — your bow. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_8-9" target=_top>Jeremiah 46:8-9</a>)<br />The rivers of Egypt are different categories of information — false information. Going up and covering the land is using factual information as a means of entry into religious questions, or matters of faith. Destroying the city is destroying true ideas. Cush and Put are religious knowledge. Lydians (the subject here) are rituals that have emerged out of factual knowledge. Grasping and bending a bow is indulging in shallow logic.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Lydia was a kingdom in western Asia Minor. [RS] </p>

That "Mizraim" or "Egypt" is memory-knowledge, was shown at verse 6 of this chapter. That "Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim" are so many rituals which are merely memory-knowledges, is evident from 
what has just been stated. Those are said to have rituals which are merely memory-knowledges, who explore spiritual and celestial things by means of reasonings, and thereby devise a worship for themselves. 
The rituals of this worship, being from reasonings and memory-knowledges, are called rituals of memory-knowledge [ritualia scientifica],* wherein there was nothing spiritual and celestial, because 
they were from themselves. Hence came the idols of Egypt, and its magic. And because their rituals were from this origin, they totally rejected, nay, loathed and hated, the rites of the Ancient 
Church, as is evident from what is said in Gen. 43:32, 46:34; Exod. 8:22. Because these things are signified, they are said to be begotten of Mizraim, or of Egypt, that is, of memory-knowledges; and as 
their memory-knowledges were diverse, the derivative rituals also became different. These diversities, in general, are signified by so many nations. That such things are meant by the Ludim, or Lydians, 
appears in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Egypt riseth up like the river, and like the rivers the waters are troubled; and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and the inhabitants 
thereof. Come up, ye horses, and rage, ye chariots, and let the mighty come forth, Cush and Put, that handle the shield, and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow (Jer. 46:8-9). The "rivers 
of Egypt" here are diverse memory-knowledges which are false; "to go up and cover the earth" is to enter into the things that pertain to the church or to faith by means of memory-knowledges; "to destroy 
the city" is to destroy truths; "Cush and Put" are knowledges; "the Lydians" are the rituals of memory-knowledge spoken of above; "to handle and bend the bow" is to reason. * These Ritualia scientifica 
were evidently sacred rites that were so framed as to be the formal expressions of the learning of the nations in question, which learning consisted in a mere memory-knowledge of the correspondences 
and spiritual truths known in the Ancient Church. It is impossible to render the phrase into satisfactory English without a circumlocution. "Scientific rituals," the usual rendering, is ludicrously 
misleading. [Reviser.] </p>

That 'Mizraim' or Egypt is knowledge has been shown already at verse 6 of this chapter; that 'Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim' are just so many forms of ritual that exist merely as items of knowledge 
is clear from what has just been stated. People who probe into spiritual and celestial things by means of reasonings and who thereby produce a form of worship for themselves are said to possess 
forms of ritual that exist merely as items of knowledge. Because the forms of ritual belonging to such worship originate in reasonings and in factual knowledge they are called fact-constituted forms 
of ritual, which have nothing spiritual or celestial within them because they originate in self. Such was the origin of Egyptian idols and so of magic. And such being the origin of those people's ritual 
forms they utterly rejected the religious practices of the Ancient Church; indeed they were repelled by them and loathed them, as is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2043:32;%2046:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 43:32; 46:34</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%208:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 8:26</a>. Because those things are 
meant, they are said to be begotten from Mizraim or Egypt, that is, from facts. And because their facts were diversified, so also were the ritual forms originating in them. These diversities in general 
were meant by just so many nations. That the Ludim or Lydians mean such things is clear from Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Egypt comes up like the river, and like the rivers the waters are tossed about; and he said, 
I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those who dwell in it Go up, O horses, and rage, O chariots, and let the mighty men go forth, Cush and Put, that handle the shield, 
and the Ludim that handle and bend the bow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the rivers of Egypt' are diverse facts that are false 'Going up and covering the earth' is entering into those things that constitute 
the Church or faith by means of facts 'Destroying the city' is destroying truths. 'Cush and Put' are cognitions 'The Lydians' are fact-constituted forms of ritual, the subject of the present verse. 
'Handling and bending the bow' is engaging in reasoning. </p>

Quod 'Mizraim seu Aegyptus' sit scientia ad vers. 6 hujus capitis ostensum est:  quod 'Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, et Naphtuhim' sint totidem ritualia quae mere scientifica sunt, constat ex illis quae modo 
dicta.  Ritualia mere scientifica praedicantur de illis qui per ratiocinia explorant spiritualia et caelestia, et inde fingunt sibi cultum; ritualia istius cultus quia ex ratiociniis et scientificis, 
vocantur ritualia scientifica, in quibus nihil spirituale et caeleste, quia a semet; inde idola Aegyptiaca, et inde magiae; et quia inde eorum ritualia, Ecclesiae Antiquae ritus prorsus rejecerunt, 
immo nausearunt et odio habuerunt, ut constat ex Gen. xliii 32; xlvi 34; Exod. viii 22; haec quia significantur, dicuntur geniti a Mizraim seu ab Aegypto, hoc est, a scientificis: et quia scientifica 
eorum fuerunt diversa, ideo quoque ritualia inde diversa facta fuerunt; diversitates in genere significatae sunt per totidem gentes:  quod talia per 'Ludim seu Ludios' intelligantur constat apud Jeremiam, Aegyptus 
sicut flumen ascendit, et sicut flumina commoventur aquae, et dixit, Ascendam, obtegam terram, perdam civitatem, et habitantes in ea; ascendite equi, insanite currus, et egrediantur fortes 
Cush et Put apprehendentes scutum, et Ludii apprehendentes, tendentes arcum, xlvi 8, 9; </p>
<p>ubi 'flumina Aegypti' sunt scientifica diversa quae falsa; 'ascendere et obtegere terram' est per scientifica 
intrare in illa quae sunt Ecclesiae seu fidei; 'perdere urbem' est destruere vera; 'Cush et Put' sunt cognitiones; 'Ludii' sunt scientifica ritualia, de quibus; 'apprehendere' et tendere arcum' est 
ratiocinari. </p>
