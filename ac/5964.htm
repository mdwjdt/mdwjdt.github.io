<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5964节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5964.</strong>“他们从埃及上去”表从教会所拥有的记忆知识中退离。这从“上去”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：从那里“上去”是指退离（从埃及进入迦南地，就说“上去”，从迦南地进入埃及，就说“下到”，原因在前面已数次说明，此处“上去”表示离开）；“埃及”在严格意义上表示教会所拥有的记忆知识（参看<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。此处之所以表示这些记忆知识，是因为他们是在与约瑟在一起时拥有这些知识的（<a href="5958.htm">5958</a>节）。从此处直到本章最后一节论述的主题是，从关于良善与真理的记忆知识，因而从教会所拥有的记忆知识中移除，前面（<a href="5962.htm">5962</a>节）提到的隐藏和此处提到的退离就表示这种移除。在圣言中，“晚上”就表示这种状态。当经历这种状态时，人们就会从属天和属灵的事物中退离，接受没有属灵或属天之物在里面的那类事物。但这种隐藏或退离的发生不是因为主隐藏自己，或退离，而是因为人们自己如此行。事实上，他们再也无法从倚靠自己当中被撤回，因为这样做并不合适。因此，当他们独自一人，或变得倚靠自己时，这种状态就到来了。他们越是倚靠自己，或越沉浸于自我倚靠，就越从天堂的事物中退离，越感觉不到良善，看不见真理。由此明显可知，主并不隐藏自己，而是世人、灵人或天使隐藏自己。</p>

And they went up out of Egypt. That this signifies a receding from the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of "going up" thence, as being to recede (mention is made of 
"going up out of Egypt into the land of Canaan," and of "coming down from that land into Egypt," for a reason several times stated above: here by "going up" is signified departing); and from the signification 
of "Egypt," which in the proper sense denotes the memory-knowledges of the church (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966). That these memory-knowledges are here signified is because they were in them when 
in Egypt with Joseph (n. 5958). Removal from those things which are of good and of truth, thus from those things which are of the church, is here treated of down to the last verse of this chapter, which 
removal is meant by the concealment mentioned above (n. 5962), and here by receding. In the Word this state is signified by "evening." When men are in this state, they recede from things heavenly and 
spiritual, and accede to such as contain nothing spiritual and heavenly. But this concealment or receding does not come to pass by the Lord's concealing Himself or receding, but by they themselves 
doing so; for they can no longer be withheld from their own, because to do so is not fitting; and therefore this state arrives when they are left to themselves or their own; and insofar as they are thus 
left, or are immersed therein, so far they recede from those things which are of heaven, and so far good becomes imperceptible to them, and truth obscure. From this it is evident that the Lord does 
not conceal Himself, but that the man, spirit, or angel conceals himself. </p>

'And they went up out of Egypt' means a departure from the factual knowledge which the Church possesses. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up' out of there as departing (one speaks of 'going up' 
from Egypt to the land of Canaan, but of 'going down' from that land to Egypt, for a reason given several times already; at this point 'going up' means going away); and from the meaning of 'Egypt' 
in the proper sense as factual knowledge which the Church possesses, dealt with in <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. The reason such factual knowledge is meant here is that it is what they had in Egypt while they were 
with Joseph, <a href="5958.htm">5958</a>. The subject now to the final verse of this chapter is a removal from factual knowledge about what is good and true and so from that which the Church possesses, which removal is meant 
above in <a href="5962.htm">5962</a> by a concealment and here by a departure. In the Word this state is meant by 'evening'. When passing through that state people depart from celestial and spiritual realities and move 
towards the kinds of things that do not have what is spiritual or celestial in them. But that concealment or departure does not come about because the Lord conceals Himself or departs but because the 
people themselves do so. For they cannot be held back any longer, because it does not suit them, from their self-reliance. That state therefore comes about when they are left to themselves or become self-reliant. 
And as far as self-reliance takes over or they become steeped in it, so far do they depart from the things of heaven, and so far does good cease to be perceptible to them or truth to be visible. 
From all this it is evident that the Lord does not conceal Himself, but that man, spirit, or angel conceals himself. </p>

`Et ascenderunt ex Aegypto': quod significet recessionem   a scientificis Ecclesiae, constat a significatione `ascendere inde' quod sit recedere; `ascendere' dicitur ab Aegypto ad terram Canaan, et 
`descendere' ab hoc ad Aegyptum, ex causa de qua aliquoties prius; hic per `ascendere' significatur abire; et ex significatione `Aegypti' quod in proprio sensu sint scientifica Ecclesiae, de qua n. 4749, 
4964, 4966; quod illa scientifica hic significentur, est quia in illis fuerunt cum in Aegypto cum Josepho, n. (x)5958. Agitur hic usque ad versum ultimum hujus capitis de remotione ab illis quae (t)sunt 
boni et veri, ita ab illis quae Ecclesiae, quae remotio {1}intelligitur per occultationem supra, n. (x)5962, et hic per recessionem; hic status in Verbo significatur per `vesperam'; cum in illo 
statu sunt, {2} recedunt a caelestibus et spiritualibus, et accedunt ad talia in quibus non spirituale et caeleste; at occultatio illa seu {3}recessio non fit per quod Dominus se occultet aut recedat 
sed quod ipsi, non enim diutius detineri possunt, quia non convenit, a proprio illorum, quapropter {4}ille status venit cum sibi seu proprio suo relinquuntur, et{5} quantum illi relinquuntur, seu in 
id immerguntur, tantum ab illis quae caeli sunt, recedunt, et tantum illis bonum fit imperceptibile et verum obscurum; inde patet quod Dominus non Se occultet sed quod homo, spiritus et angelus seipsum. @1
