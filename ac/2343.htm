<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2343节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2343.</strong>“他们就吃了”表归给。这从“吃”的含义清楚可知，“吃”是指沟通和结合，因而是指归给（参看<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>节）。综上所述，清楚可知前一节和本节的内容在内义上是如何被排列和联结起来的，即“那两个天使”表主的神圣人性及其神圣活动，“转向他”表呆在一起，“进到他屋里”表确认良善，“预备筵席”表住在一起，“烤无酵饼”表洁净。“吃了”表归给。由此明显可知内义上的整个思路是何性质，尽管这内义并未在历史意义中显出蛛丝马迹。<br />这就是圣言的所有各个部分所具有的秩序和系列。不过，这些系列本身的性质不可能因这几句话的解读就变得明显起来，否则，一切事物都显得分散、不连贯，并且意义的连续性也会丧失。当将所有事物综括在一个完整观念里来看，或以一个完整的心理图像来理解它们时，那些正变成教会成员（他们在此由罗得来代表）之人的整个改造和重生的过程就会在这几句话中呈现出来。也就是说，一开始，他们察觉到某种程度的试探，但当他们坚持下来并战胜时，主就与他们呆在一起，并使他们巩固在良善中，引导他们来到祂自己这里，进入祂的国度，与他们同居，在那里洁净并完善他们，同时将良善与快乐之物归给他们。祂通过其神圣人性和神圣活动完成所有这一切。<br />一切重生或新生，因而救恩唯独来自主，这一点在教会的确为人所知，但很少有人相信，因为他们没有仁之善。那些没有仁之善的人不可能拥有这样的信仰，就象骆驼不可能穿过针眼一样。因为仁之善是信之种的苗床。真理与良善能达成一致，但真理与邪恶永远不可能一致：它们具有相反的性质，彼此对立。因此，人越处于良善，就越能处于真理；或越处于仁爱，就越能处于信，尤其处于信的这一要点：一切救恩来自主。<br />这是信的要点，这一点从圣言中的很多经文明显看出来。如约翰福音：<br />神爱世人，甚至赐下祂的独生子，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">3:16</a>）<br /><br />信子的人有永生；不信子的人必不得见生命，神的震怒常在他身上。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">3:36</a>）<br /><br />信父所差来的祂，这就是神的工。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.29.htm">6:29</a>）<br /><br />这是祂的旨意，就是那差我来的：一切见子而信的人得永生，并且在末日我要叫祂复活。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.40.htm">6:40</a>）<br /><br />你们若不信我是那一位，必要死在罪中。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.24.htm">8:24</a>）<br /><br />复活在我，生命也在我；信我的人，虽然死了，也必复活。凡活着信我的人必永远不死。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">11:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.26.htm">26</a>）<br />若不被良善所主导，没人能信主；也就是说，若没有仁爱，没人能拥有信。这也清楚可见于约翰福音：<br />凡接待祂的，就是信他名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。这等人不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br /><br />我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能作什么。人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干。正如父爱我，我也爱你们，你们要常在我的爱里。你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样，这就是我的命令。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">15:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.12.htm">12</a>）<br />由上述经文可以看出，对主之爱和对邻之仁就是信的生命。但是，沉浸于邪恶，即过着邪恶生活的人不可能相信一切救恩来自主。这一点通过那些从基督教界进入来世之人，以及那些在肉身生活时根据信的教条口头上承认，甚至教导没有主就没有救恩，然而却过着邪恶生活的人向我显明。一提及主的名，这些人周围就充满完全反对的氛围。因为在来世，灵人的所思所想能被觉察到，并从自身发出一种气场，其中这些人所拥有的信的性质会显现出来（参看<a href="1394.htm">1394</a>节）。<br />在这些人当中仅仅提及爱或仁，我就发觉他们发出某种可以说充满黑暗，同时又充满灰尘样的东西。这种东西是污秽之爱的产物，具有这样的性质，即它会灭绝、窒息并败坏对主之爱和对邻之仁的一切感觉。这就是当今的信，他们说，这信无需仁之善就能施救。<br />同样是这些人被问及他们拥有什么样的信，因为这不是他们在肉身生活时所自称的信。由于在来世，没人能隐藏自己的想法，于是，他们说，他们信神，宇宙的创造者。然而，当他们接受检查，以查看是否如此时，却发现他们不信任何神，反而认为万物皆出于自然，关于永生所说的一切都是空的，毫无价值。这就是所有那些不信主，却声称他们信神，宇宙的创造者的教会中人之信。因为真理不可能从其它源头，只能从主流入；除了源于主的良善外，真理无法被播种于任何事物。主的神圣人性和神圣活动一起成为生命和救恩的途径和源头。这一点从圣餐上的这些话清楚可知：“这是我的身体；这是我的血”，也就是主的神圣人性。显然，这是一切神圣之物的源头。无论你说祂的神圣人性，还是说祂的身体，祂的肉，或饼，亦或神性之爱，意思都一样。因为主的神圣人性是纯粹的爱，神圣活动唯独在于爱，而信的神圣即源于此。</p>

And they did eat. That this signifies appropriation, is evident from the signification of "eating," which is to be communicated and conjoined, thus to be appropriated (see above, n. 2187). From what 
has been already said and unfolded it can be seen how the things contained in the preceding verse, and in this, are circumstanced in the internal sense, and how in that sense they cohere together; from 
the fact that by the "angels" is signified the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding; by "turning aside to him," having an abode; by "coming to his house," being confirmed in good; by "making a feast," 
dwelling together; by "baking unleavened bread," being purified; and by "eating," being appropriated. From this it is evident what is the series and connection of things in the internal sense, although 
nothing whatever of it appears in the historical sense. [2] Such is the order and series in all of the things of the Word, both in general and particular. But the series itself such as it is 
in itself cannot be made to appear in an explication of the several words, for in that case everything appears in a disconnected form, and the continuity of the sense is dissipated. But when all things 
are viewed together in one idea, or are perceived in one mental view, as is the case with those who are in the internal sense and at the same time in heavenly light from the Lord, there is then presented 
to view in these words the entire process of the reformation and regeneration of those who are becoming men of the church (who are here represented by Lot), to wit, that at first they perceive something 
of temptation, but when they persist and overcome, the Lord has an abode with them, and confirms them in good, introduces them unto Himself in His kingdom, and dwells with them, and there purifies 
and perfects them, and at the same time appropriates good and happy things to them, and this by means of His Divine Human and Holy proceeding.  [3] That all regeneration or new life, thus salvation, 
is from the Lord alone, is indeed known in the church, but is believed by few, for the reason that men are not in the good of charity. It is as impossible for those who are not in the good of charity 
to have this belief, as it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle; for the good of charity is the very ground for the seeds of faith. Truth and good agree, but truth and evil never: they 
are of a contrary nature, and are averse one to the other. For this reason, so far as a man is in good, so far he can be in truth; or so far as he is in charity, so far he can be in faith; especially 
in this chief point of faith, that all salvation is from the Lord. [4] That this is the chief point of faith, is evident from many passages in the Word, as in John: </p>
<p>     God so loved the world, that 
He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:16). Again: </p>
<p>     He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life, but he that believeth 
not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him (John 3:36). Again: </p>
<p>     This is the work of God, that ye believe in Him whom the Father hath sent (John 6:29). Again: </p>
<p>    
 This is the will of Him that sent Me, that everyone that seeth the Son, and believeth in Him, should have eternal life; and I will raise Him up at the last day (John 6:40). Again: </p>
<p>     Except ye believe 
that I am, ye shall die in your sins (John 8:24). Again: </p>
<p>     I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he die, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth 
in Me shall never die (John 11:25-26). [5] That no one can believe in the Lord unless he is in good, that is, that no one can have faith unless he is in charity, is also evident in John: </p>
<p>     As many 
as received Him, to them gave He power to become children of God, to them that believe in His name; who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 
1:12-13). And again: </p>
<p>     I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit, for without Me ye can do nothing. If one abide not in Me, he is cast 
forth as a branch, and is withered. As the Father hath loved Me, I also have loved you; abide ye in My love. This is My commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you (John 15:5-6, 9, 12). [6] 
From these passages it can be seen that love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor are the life of faith. But that they who are in evil, that is, in a life of evil, cannot possibly believe 
that all salvation is from the Lord, has been made evident to me from those who had come into the other life from the Christian world; and also from those who in the life of the body had confessed with 
the mouth and had even taught, according to the doctrinal tenet of faith, that without the Lord there is no salvation, and yet had led a life of evil. These, when the Lord was merely named, forthwith 
filled the sphere with endless difficulties (for in the other life that which spirits merely think is perceived, and diffuses from itself a sphere, in which it becomes manifest in what kind of faith 
they are; see n. 1394). [7] Among the same, when love or charity was merely mentioned, there was perceived from them something as it were full of darkness and at the same time clotted from a kind of 
filthy love; which thing was of such a nature as to extinguish, suffocate, and pervert all perception of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor. Such is the faith at this day, which they 
say saves without the good of charity. [8] The same also on being asked what faith they had (since they had not that which they had professed in the life of the body) said (for in the other life no 
one can conceal what he thinks) that they believed in God the Creator of the universe. But when they were examined in order to see whether it was so, it was found that they did not believe in any God, 
but thought that all things are of nature, and that all things that have been said about eternal life are empty and worthless. Such is the faith of all those within the Church who do not believe in 
the Lord, but say that they believe in God the Creator of the universe. For truth can flow in from no other source than the Lord; nor can truth be inseminated in anything except the good which is from 
the Lord.  [9] That it is the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding by means of which and from which come life and salvation, is very well known from the words of the Holy Supper: "This is My Body;" 
"this is My Blood;" which is the Lord's Divine Human; and it is evident that all the Holy is from this. Whether you say His Divine Human, or His Body, or His Flesh, or the Bread, or the Divine Love, 
it is the same; for the Lord's Divine Human is pure Love, and the Holy is of love alone, and from this is derived the Holy of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2343</b></p><p><b>2343.</b>
'And they ate' means making one's own. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as being communicated and joined together, thus being made one's own, dealt with already in <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>. What has been stated 
and explained so far makes clear how the contents of the previous and the present verses are arranged and link together in the internal sense - from the fact that 'the angels' means the Lord's Divine 
Human and His Holy proceeding, 'turning aside to him' means staying with, 'coming to his house' being confirmed in good, 'making a feast' dwelling together, 'baking unleavened bread' being purified, 
and 'eating' taking into oneself and making one's own. It shows the nature of the train of thought in the internal sense, though nothing at all of that sense is apparent in the historical sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Such is the order and the train of thought that exists with all the individual parts of the Word. But the nature of that actual train of thought cannot begin to reveal itself when each word is explained 
separately; for in that case each is seen in isolation from the rest and the continuity of meaning is lost. It reveals itself when all the separate details are seen together within one complete 
idea, or are perceived as one complete mental picture, as is done by those who have the internal sense and who at the same time dwell in heavenly light from the Lord. Within these words [used here in 
Genesis] such people are given to see the entire process of the reformation and regeneration of those who become members of the Church, represented here by Lot. That is to say, they first of all perceive 
some degree of temptation, but when they persevere and overcome the Lord stays with them, and confirms them in good, brings them to Himself into His kingdom, and dwells together with them, and there 
purifies and perfects them, at the same time granting them as their own things that are good and happy. All this He accomplishes by means of His Divine Human and His Holy proceeding.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Within 
the Church it is indeed well known that all regeneration or new life, and therefore salvation, comes from the Lord alone, but few believe it. The reason they do not believe it is that the good of charity 
does not exist in them. It is as impossible for those in whom that good does not exist to believe it as it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle; for the good of charity is the very seed-bed 
of faith. Truth and good agree together, but truth and evil never do. They have contrary natures and turn away from each other. Insofar therefore as someone is moved by good, he can be governed 
by truth, that is, insofar as charity exists with him faith is able to, especially the most fundamental matter of faith that all salvation comes from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That this is the most-fundamental 
matter of faith is clear from many places in the Word, as in John, </p>
<blockquote>
God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3: 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not believe in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:-36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the 
same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom the Father has sent. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:-29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:-29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
This is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son 
and believes in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:-40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:-24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the 
same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he die, yet will he live. And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2011:-25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 11:-25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Nobody is 
able to believe in the Lord unless he is governed by good, that is, no one can possess faith unless he has charity. This too is clear in John, </p>
<blockquote>
As many as received Him, to them He gave power to be 
sons of God, to those believing in His name, who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:-12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:-12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the vine, 
you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for without Me you can do nothing. If a man does not abide in Me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered. 
As the Father has loved Me so I have loved you; abide in My love. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:-5,%206,%209,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:-5, 6, 9, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From all these quotations it becomes 
clear that love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour constitute the life of faith. But that people who are immersed in evil, that is, who lead a life of evil, cannot possibly believe that 
all salvation comes from the Lord has become clear to me from those who have entered the next life from the Christian world; and also from people who during their lifetime have confessed with their lips 
the established teaching of faith, and indeed have taught it themselves, that without the Lord there is no salvation, but who, for all that, have led a life of evil. At the very mention of the Lord's 
name these people have filled the atmosphere around them entirely with objections. For in the next life solely that which people are thinking is perceived and sends out from itself a sphere, in which 
the nature of the faith possessed by those people reveals itself, see <a href="1394.htm">1394</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 At the mere mention of love or charity among these people I perceived emanating from them something that was so to 
speak full of darkness and at the same time dust-filled. The product of some filthy love, it was by nature such that it obliterated, stifled, and corrupted all feeling of love to the Lord and of charity 
towards the neighbour. Such is the faith at the present day, which, they say, saves without the goods that flow from charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 The same people were also asked what faith they had since it was 
not the faith they had professed during their lifetime. Since in the next life nobody can conceal what he actually thinks, they said that they believed in God the Creator of all things. They were examined 
however as to whether this was really so, and it was discovered that they did not believe in any God at all but thought that all things were the product of natural forces, and all that has been 
said about eternal life is nonsense. Such is the faith of everyone inside the Church who does not believe in the Lord but says that he believes in God the Creator of all things. For truth cannot flow 
in from any other source than the Lord, and truth cannot be sown in anything other than good which is derived from the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 That the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding are together 
the channel and the source of life and salvation is well recognized from the words of the Holy Supper, 'This is My body, This is My blood', which is the Lord's Divine Human. And it is clear that this 
is the source of everything holy. Whether we speak of the Divine Human, or His Body, or Flesh, or Bread, or Divine Love, it amounts to the same thing; for the Lord's Divine Human is pure Love, and the 
Holy [proceeding] consists in love alone, while the Holy that constitutes faith is derived from this. </p>

`Et comederunt': quod significet appropriationem, constat a significatione `comedere' quod sit communicari et conjungi, ita appropriari, de qua prius n. 2187.  Ex dictis nunc et explicatis constare 
potest quomodo illa quae in versu praecedente et in hoc continentur, se in sensu interno habent et cohaerent, ex eo quod per `angelos' significetur Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Dominum; per `declinare 
ad eum' mansionem habere; per `venire ad domum ejus' confirmari in bonos; per `facere convivium' cohabitare; per `azyma coquere' purificari; et per `comedere' appropriari; inde qualis sit series 
rerum in sensu interno, patet, tametsi nihil prorsus ejus apparet in sensu historico; [2] talis est ordo et series in omnibus et singulis Verbi, sed ipsa series non potest elucescere qualis est, in 
explicatione singularum vocum, inde enim ut discreta apparent, et dissipatur continuum sensus, sed cum omnia simul spectantur una idea, aut percipiuntur uno intuitu cogitationis, sicut fit apud illos 
qui in sensu interno sunt, et simul in luce caelesti a Domino; apud hos sistitur in illis verbis videndus integer processus reformationis ac regenerationis eorum qui fiunt homines Ecclesiae hic per 
`Lotum' repraesentati; nempe quod primum percipiant aliquid tentationis, sed cum persistunt et vincunt, quod Dominus mansionem apud eos habeat, et confirmet eos in bono, introducat eos ad Se in regnum 
Suum, et cum iis cohabitet, ac ibi eos purificet et perficiat, et simul appropriet iis bona et felicia, et hoc per Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Ipsius.  [3] Quod a solo Domino omnis regeneratio 
seu nova vita, proinde salus, notum quidem est in Ecclesia, sed a paucis creditur; quod non credatur, est causa quia non in bono charitatis sunt; qui non in hoc sunt, illis tam impossibile est hoc 
credere quam est camelo intrare per foramen acus, nam bonum charitatis est ipsa humus seminum fidei; verum et bonum concordant, sed verum et malum nusquam; sunt contrariae indolis, et aversatur unum alterum, 
quare quantum homo est in bono, tantum potest esse in vero, seu quantum in charitate, tantum in fide, cumprimis in hoc principali fidei, quod a Domino omnis salus; [4] quod hoc principale fidei 
sit, constat a pluribus in Verbo: ut apud Johannem, 	Adeo dilexit Deus mundum, ut Filium Suum unigenitum dederit, ut omnis qui credit in Ipsum, non pereat, sed habeat vitam aeternam, iii 16: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Qui credit in Filium, habet vitam aeternam, qui vero non credit Filio, non videbit vitam, sed ira Dei manet super illo, iii 36: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Hoc (o)est opus Dei, ut credatis in Ipsum Quem 
misit Pater, vi 29: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Haec est voluntas Ipsius, Qui misit Me, ut omnis qui videt Filium, et credit in Ipsum, habeat vitam aeternam, et resuscitem illum in extremo die, vi 40: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Nisi 
credideritis quod Ego sim, moriemini in peccatis vestris, viii 24: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ego sum resurrectio et vita, qui credit in Me, etsi moriatur, vivet; omnis vero qui vivit, et credit in Me, 
non morietur in aeternum, xi 25, 26. [5]	Quod nemo credere possit in Dominum nisi in bono sit, hoc est, quod nullus (t)possit habere fidem nisi sit in charitate, constat etiam apud Johannem, 	Quotquot 
receperunt, dedit illis potestatem, ut filii Dei essent, credentibus in nomen Ipsius, qui non ex sanguinibus, neque e voluntate carnis, neque e voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt, i 12, 13 et 
apud eundem, 	Ego sum vitis, vos palmites, qui manet in Me, et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum, quia sine Me non potestis facere quicquam; nisi quis manserit in Me, ejectus est foras sicut palmes, 
et arefactus:... quemadmodum amavit Me Pater, ita Ego amavi vos, manete in amore Meo;... hoc est mandatum Meum, ut ametis vos invicem, sicut amavi vos, xv 5, 6, 9, 12. [6] Ex his constare potest quod 
amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum sit vita fidei: qui autem in malo sunt, hoc est, in vita mali, quod nusquam credere possint quod a Domino omnis salus [sit,] constare mihi potuit ab illis 
qui e Christiano orbe in alteram vitam venerunt, etiam ex illis qui in vita corporis secundum doctrinale fidei ore fassi [sunt], immo docuerunt, quod absque Domino nulla salus, et tamen vitam mali egerunt; 
illi cum modo nominatus est Dominus, ilico oppleverunt sphaeram meris scandalis; nam quod solum cogitant in altera vita, appercipitur, et diffundit a se sphaeram, in qua se manifestat quali fide 
sunt, videatur n. 1394: [7] apud eosdem cum modo nominatus amor seu charitas, perceptum ab illis sicut tenebricosum quoddam, et simul grumosum, ex amore quodam spurco, quod talis naturae erat ut exstingueret, 
suffocaret et perverteret omne perceptivum amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum; talis est fides hodie quam dicunt salvare absque bonis charitatis: [8] iidem quoque interrogati quam 
fidem habuerint, cum non illam quam in vita corporis fassi, dixerunt, {2} (nam celare quod cogitat, in altera vita nemo potest:) quod crediderint in Deum Creatorem universi; sed explorati num ita esset, 
et compertum [est] quod non in aliquem Deum crediderint, sed cogitaverint omnia naturae esse, ac vana quaecumque de vita aeterna dicta sunt; talis fides est omnium illorum intra Ecclesiam qui non 
credunt in Dominum, sed dicunt se credere in Deum Creatorem universi; aliunde enim non influere potest verum quam a Domino, nec potest verum inseminari quam in bono quod a Domino.  [9] Quod Humanum Divinum 
et Sanctum procedens Domini sit, per quod et ex quo vita et salus, scitur manifeste a verbis Sacrae Cenae, `Hoc est corpus Meum, hic est sanguis Meus,' quod est Divinum Humanum Domini, et quod 
inde sit omne Sanctum, constat; sive dicas Divinum Humanum, sive Corpus, sive Carnem, sive Panem, sive Divinum Amorem, idem est; Divinum enim Humanum Domini est purus Amor, et Sanctum est solius amoris, 
at Sanctum fidei est inde. 	@1 at.$ 	@2 A c ().$ </p>
