<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1524节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1524.</strong>一束强烈的火焰出乎意料地倾泄在我面前，不仅使我的肉眼，还使我的内在视觉眼花缭乱。紧接着又出现一种看似乌云的黑暗，其中似乎包含了某种属世之物。正当我对此惊讶不已时，我被引导认识到天堂天使所在之光与灵人界之光相比，差距如此之大；尽管灵人也生活在光中，但仍有这样的差别；正如光一样，天使的聪明智慧也远远胜过灵人的；不仅聪明智慧，还有与之相关的一切，包括言谈、思维、喜乐和幸福等同样如此，因为这些与光相对应。我由此清楚知道天使的完美何等伟大，以及与世人相比，它是何性质，世人的幽暗甚至比灵人的更大。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1524.</strong> An intense flame dropped into view unexpectedly, powerfully dazzling not only my physical sight but also my inner vision. Soon a dark spot appeared, like a dusky cloud with something earthlike about it. When I wondered about it, I was taught that the light among angels in heaven is just as bright compared to the light in the world of spirits. Although spirits also live in light, there is a comparable difference between the two. Like the light, the understanding and wisdom of angels is greater than that of spirits 钬?and not just the understanding and wisdom but everything that comes from understanding and wisdom, such as speech, thought, joy, and gladness, because these correspond to the light. As a result, I was able to see how much more perfect angels are than people on earth, whose darkness is even greater than that of spirits. </p>

An intense flaming irradiation unexpectedly poured down before my eyes, dazzling them greatly-not merely the light of the eye, but the interior sight also. Presently there appeared a sort of obscurity, 
like a thick cloud, in which there was as it were something earthy. While I wondered at this it was given me to know that such is the light with the angels in heaven in comparison with that in the 
world of spirits; and that although the spirits live in light, yet still there is such a difference; and that, as does the light, so also do the intelligence and the wisdom of the angels surpass those 
of spirits; and not their intelligence and wisdom only, but also all things that belong to these, such as their speech, thought, joys, and felicities; for these correspond to the light. This evidenced 
to me how great and of what nature are the perfections of angels as compared with men, who are in greater obscurity even than spirits. </p>

A blazing flame streamed down unexpectedly in front of me, blinding with its power not only the sight of my eyes but also my interior sight. Shortly afterwards a kind of obscurity appeared like a dark 
cloud containing so to speak something earthy. While I wondered at this I was led to realize that the light among angels in heaven is, in contrast to the light in the world of spirits, so much greater. 
Although spirits do live in light it is nevertheless as different as that. And as is the case with the light, so too are the intelligence and wisdom of angels superior to the intelligence and wisdom 
of spirits; and not only their intelligence and wisdom, but also everything connected with these, such as speech, thought, joy, and forms of happiness, for these correspond to the light. From this 
it has also become clear to me how great angelic perfection is, and what its nature is in contrast to that of men whose obscurity is even greater than that of spirits. </p>

</p><b>1524.</b>
Inopinato decidit flammeum intensum ante oculum, quem valde perstrinxit, non solum oculi visum sed etiam interiorem; mox apparuit obscurum quoddam ut nubes opaca, in qua quasi terrenum; cumque mirarer, 
mihi scire datum quod lux apud angelos in caelo tanta sit respective ad lucem in mundo spirituum, tametsi spiritus in luce vivunt, sed usque quod talis differentia sit; et quod sicut lux, ita quoque 
habeat se intelligentia et sapientia angelorum prae intelligentia et sapientia spirituum; et non solum intelligentia et sapientia, sed et omnia quae sunt intelligentiae et sapientiae, ut loquela, cogitatio, 
gaudia, felicitates, nam haec correspondent luci; inde constare mihi quoque potuit quantae et quales perfectiones angelorum sunt respective ad homines, qui in obscuro sunt prae spiritibus. </p>
