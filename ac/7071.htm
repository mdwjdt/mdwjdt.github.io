<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7071.</strong>为叫我确切地知道这就是他们的本性，我被允许将牧场、耕地、花园、树林和河流展现给他们；但他们立刻改变它们。他们将牧场和新开垦的田地变暗，用代表使它们充满蛇；又使河流变黑，以致河水不再显得清澈透明。于是，我问他们为何这样做，他们说，他们不愿思想这类事物，只愿思想真实事物，也就是诸如从尘世事物抽象出来的那类事物的知识，尤其诸如在天堂所见到的那类事物的知识。</p>

In order that I might know for certain that such is their genius, I was allowed to represent to them meadows, fallow grounds, gardens, woods, and rivers; but they at once changed them, darkening the 
meadows and fallow grounds, and by representations filling them with snakes; the rivers they made black, so that the water no longer appeared limpid. Then I asked them why they did so, they said that 
they are unwilling to think about such things, but only about real ones, which are the knowledges of such things as are abstracted from what is earthly, especially about such as arise in the heavens. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7071</b></p><p><b>7071.</b>
In order that I might know for certain that their disposition was such, I was allowed to represent meadows, newly ploughed fields, gardens, woodlands, and streams to them; but they immediately began 
to transform them. The meadows and newly ploughed fields they darkened, using representations to fill them with snakes; and they blackened the streams so that the water was not clear in appearance. When 
I asked them why they were acting in that way they said that they did not wish to think about those kinds of things, only about realities, which consist in the knowledge of things devoid of their earthly 
associations, especially the knowledge of such as are found in heaven. </p>

</p><b>7071.</b>
Ut pro certo scirem quod talis eorum genius esset, licuit repraesentare illis prata, novalia, hortos, silvas, flumina, sed ilico transmutabant illa; prata et novalia obscurabant, et per repraesentationes 
implebant anguibus; flumina denigrabant, ut aqua non limpida appareret; {1}cum quaererem cur ita facerent, dicebant quod non velint cogitare de talibus, sed de realibus, quae sunt cognitiones rerum 
a terrestribus abstractarum, imprimis talium quae existunt in caelis. 	@1 cumque$ </p>
