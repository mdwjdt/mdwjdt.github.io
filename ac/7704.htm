<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7704节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7704.</strong>“吹入红海”表丢进地狱。这从“红海”的含义清楚可知，“红海”是指地狱，如下文所解释的，那里论述了蒙主的神性怜悯，以色列人穿过红海，而埃及人则在红海中灭亡。被丢进地狱并非表示虚假从侵扰者那里被拿走，被丢到别处；而是表示它仍留在他们身上，并把他们与这类事物所在的地狱联结起来。因为恶人在来世所进入的邪恶和虚假的一切状态将他们与属于这种状态的一切事物所存在的地狱联结起来。因此，在他们完全荒凉之前所经历的一系列阶段期间，他们与许多地狱相联结。我将在别处通过经历讨论这些问题。</p>

And cast it into the sea Suph. That this signifies into hell, is evident from the signification of "the sea Suph," as being hell (of which in what follows, where, of the Lord's Divine mercy, the passage 
of the sons of Israel through that sea, and the destruction of the Egyptians therein, is to be treated of). By being cast into hell is not meant that the falsity was taken away from the infesters, 
and cast elsewhere; but that it remained with them, and that by means of it they were conjoined with the hells, where such things are. For in the other life, by every state of evil and falsity into which 
they enter, the evil are conjoined with the hells, where are all things that belong to such a state. Thus conjunction is effected successively with many hells before they are fully devastated, but 
of this more will be told from experience elsewhere. </p>

'And cast them into the Sea Suph' means into hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'the Sea Suph' as hell, explained further on where the passage of the children of Israel through that sea and the 
destruction of the Egyptians in it is in the Lord's Divine mercy to be dealt with. Being cast into hell should not be taken to mean that the falsity was taken away from the molesters and cast away somewhere 
else, but that it remained with them and linked them to hells where such things exist. For every state of evil and falsity that the evil in the next life enter links them to the hells where things 
belonging to that kind of state exist. Consequently they become linked to many hells during a series of stages they pass through before their vastation is completed. But a discussion of these matters 
from experience is to appear elsewhere.  </p>

`Et conjecit illam in mare Suph': quod significet in infernum, constat ex significatione `maris Suph' quod sit infernum, de qua in sequentibus ubi de transitu filiorum Israelis per mare illud, et de 
interitu Aegyptiorum ibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, agendum est; per conjici in infernum non intelligitur quod falsum ab infestantibus ablatum sit, et conjectum aliunde, sed quod apud infestantes 
remanserit, et {1} per illud conjuncti sint infernis ubi talia; nam mali in altera vita, {2}per omnem statum mali et falsi quem ineunt, conjunguntur cum infernis, ubi {3}illa quae talis status; inde 
conjunctio fit {4}successive cum pluribus, antequam plene devastati sunt; sed de his ab experientia alibi {5}. 	@1 i sic$ 	@2 cum statum novum mali vel falsi recipiunt, tunc$ 	@3 talia$ 	@4 cum totidem, 
quot novos status recipiunt; per conjungi significatur communicatio$ 	@5 i plura$ </p>
