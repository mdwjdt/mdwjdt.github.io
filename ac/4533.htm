<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4533节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4533.</strong>发生在来世的奇迹之一是：当天上的天使注视恶灵时，这些灵人在天使眼里的形像，完全不同于他们在彼此眼中的形像。当恶灵和魔鬼在他们自己中间，并处于自己的虚假之光（如前所述，这光如同煤火所发出的光）时，他们在自己看来以人的形式存在，并且按照他们的幻觉，也不丑陋。但当这些灵人被天上的天使注视时，这幽暗之光立刻被驱散，他们便显出完全不同的脸，每个灵人都有一张体现其特性的脸。有的像魔鬼一样黝黑；有的长有像死尸那样可怕的脸；有的几乎没有脸，取而代之的是一团头发；有的像齿栅；有的像骷髅。更令人惊愕的是，有的像怪物，骗子像蛇，大骗子像毒蛇，而其他人也长有各种不同的脸。不过，一旦天使不再注视他们，这些灵人就以他们之前在自己的幽暗之光中所拥有的形式显现。每当天使发觉他们试图离开地狱进入灵人界，企图向其他人行恶时，就会注视恶人；他们便以这种方式被发现并遣返。天使的视力之所以具有如此功效，是因为理解力的视觉和眼睛的视觉之间存在一种对应关系；因此，他们的视力具有一种驱散地狱之光的敏锐性，于是，恶灵的形式和特性的真正性质就显出来了。</p>

Among the wonderful things that take place in the other life is also this, that when the angels of heaven look at evil spirits, the latter appear altogether different from what they appear to one another. 
When evil spirits and genii are by themselves, and in their own fatuous luminosity (which as before said is like that of a coal fire), they appear to themselves to be in a human form, and also according 
to their phantasies not uncomely. But when the same are looked at by the angels of heaven, that luminosity is instantly dissipated, and they appear with totally different faces, each according 
to his genius. Some are dusky and black like devils; some have ghastly faces like that of a corpse; some have almost no face at all, and instead of a face there is a mass of hair; some are like grates 
of teeth; some like skeletons; and what was still more strange, some are like monsters, the deceitful are like serpents, and the most deceitful are like vipers, while others appear differently. But 
as soon as the angels remove their look from them, they appear in their own previous form, such as they have in their own luminosity. The angels look at the evil whenever they observe them trying to 
get out of their hells into the world of spirits, intending to do evil to others; and in this way they are detected and are cast back again. The reason why there is such an efficacy in the look of the 
angels, is that there is a correspondence between intellectual sight and that of the eye; and therefore there is a sharp-sightedness in their look, before which the infernal luminosity is dissipated, 
and evil spirits appear in the form and genius that belong to them. </p>

Included among the wonders that occur in the next life is this: When the angels of heaven look at evil spirits these spirits appear altogether different to them from how the spirits appear to one another. 
Among themselves and in their own false light, which is like that emitted from a coal fire, as has been stated, evil spirits and genii appear to themselves to exist in human form, which in keeping 
with their own delusions is not unattractive. But when the same spirits are looked at by the angels of heaven that dim light is immediately dispelled and they acquire an altogether different facial 
appearance, each spirit now having a face that expresses his particular disposition. Some are swarthy and dark like devils; some have ghastly faces like those of dead bodies; some have almost no face 
at all but instead something covered in hair; some are all teeth, looking like a crate; others like skeletons. Even more amazing than this, some look like monsters, the deceitful like serpents, and the 
very deceitful like vipers; and there are others with different faces again. But as soon as the angels cease to look at them those spirits appear in the form which they possessed previously in their 
own dim light. The angels take a look at the evil as often as they realize that they are endeavouring to leave their hells for the world of spirits with the intention of doing harm to others. As a consequence 
they are found out and turned back. The reason why angelic sight is so efficient is that there is a correspondence between the sight of the understanding and that of the eye; their sight possesses 
an acuteness which dispels the light of hell, and then the true nature of the evil spirits' form and disposition is visible. </p>

Inter mirabilia quae in altera vita existunt, etiam hoc est quod cum angeli (o)caeli inspiciunt in malos spiritus, hi prorsus aliter appareant quam prout apparent inter se.  Cum mali spiritus et 
genii inter se sunt, ac in lumine suo fatuo, quale {1} ex igne carbonario, ut dictum, tunc apparent sibi in {2} forma humana, et quoque secundum phantasias suas non impulchra; ast cum iidem inspiciuntur 
ab angelis caeli, tunc dissipatur actutum lumen illud, et comparent prorsus alia facie, quisque secundum genium suum, quidam furvi et nigri sicut diaboli, quidam facie lurida sicut cadavera, 
quidam paene absque facie, et loco ejus crinitum quid, quidam sicut dentium crates, quidam sicut sceleta; et quod mirabilius, quidam sicut monstra, dolosi sicut serpentes, et dolosissimi sicut viperae, 
et alii aliter: {3} sed [ut] primum angeli removent ab illis visum suum, apparent in sua forma priore quam in suo lumine habent.  Angeli toties inspectant malos quoties animadvertunt quod ex infernis 
suis enitantur in mundum spirituum et aliis malum intentent; inde deteguntur et rejiciuntur.  Causa quod visui angelico talis efficacia insit, est quia correspondentia est inter visum intellectualem 
et ocularem, inde inest visui eorum perspicacia ex qua dissipatur lumen infernale, et apparent quali forma et genio sunt.      @1 quali$      @2 inter se$      @3 i haec millies mihi visa sunt$ </p>
