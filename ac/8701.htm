<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8701节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8701.</strong>“你独自一人做不了”表没有任何来自良善的真理从另一个源头流入。这从“独自一人做这事”的含义清楚可知，“独自一人做这事”当论及“摩西”所代表的神之真理时，是指唯独来自它，同时没有来自其它任何源头的真理的流注。此处的情况从前面（<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>节）关于神之真理的直接流注，以及它的直接同时间接流注的阐述可以看出来；即：神之真理的直接流注在一个人正经历重生时的第一个状态下发生；但直接和间接流注在第二个状态下，也就是说，当他已经重生时发生。当流注是直接的时，主虽以良善和真理流入，但那时良善没有被感知到，只有真理被感知到。故在此期间，他通过真理被引导，不怎么通过良善被引导。不过，当流注同时是间接的时，良善就被感知到，因为间接流注抵达一个人的外在感官层。正因如此，这时主通过良善引导此人。<br />一般来说，要知道，直到一个人出于对良善的情感行事，他才得以重生；因为这时，他意愿良善，并在行善中觅得快乐和幸福。当他达到这种状态时，他的生命是良善的生命，他就在天堂中，因为在天堂处处掌权的，是良善。构成信的真理虽引导一个人朝向良善，从而朝向天堂，却不能把他放在天堂。其原因在于，在来世，所有人都照着意愿的生命，而非理解力的生命形成不同的社群；因为意愿在哪里，理解力就在哪里，反过来不行。无论在天堂还是地狱，都是这种情况。那些邪恶的人不会被送入地狱，直到其生活的邪恶掌控他们；因为当这邪恶掌控他们时，其邪恶的虚假也会掌控他们；那些在天堂处于良善的人同样处于其良善的真理。在来世，所有人都被带入拥有一个心智的状态，也就是说，其意愿的意图与其思维相一致，而非相矛盾。世上的情况则不然，因为在世上，一个人所想的，甚至所理解的，不同于他所意愿的。但这是为了使他能得以改造，也就是使他能理解何为良善，尽管他意愿邪恶，从而使他能通过理解力被引导意愿良善。不过，在来世，人人都照着他在世上所获得的意愿而被引导。</p>

Thou art not able to do it, thou alone. That this signifies without the influx of truth from good* from some other source, is evident from the signification of "doing it alone," when said of the truth 
Divine represented by Moses, as being the influx of truth from it alone, and not at the same time from some other source. How the case herein is can be seen from what was said above (n. 8685) concerning 
the immediate influx of truth Divine, and concerning its influx immediate and at the same time mediate; namely, that the influx of truth Divine is immediate in the first state of man when he is being 
regenerated; but that the influx is immediate and mediate in the second state, that is, when he has been regenerated. When the influx is immediate, the Lord indeed flows in with good and truth, yet 
the good is not then perceived, but truth; therefore the man is then led by means of truth, not so much by good. But when the influx is at the same time mediate, then good is perceived, for mediate 
influx is into the man's external sensuous; hence it is that the man is then led by the Lord by means of good. In general be it known that a man has not been regenerated until he acts from the affection 
of good; for he then wills good, and it is delightful and blessed to him to do it. When he is in this state, his life is the life of good, and he is in heaven, for what universally reigns in heaven 
is good; the truth which is of faith, however, leads man to good, thus to heaven, but does not place him in heaven. The reason of this is that in the other life all are associated together according 
to the life of the will, not according to the life of the understanding; for where the will is, there the understanding is, but not the reverse: it is so in heaven, and it is so in hell. They who are 
evil are not sent into hell until they are in the evil of their life; for when they are in this, they are also in the falsity of their evil; in like manner they who are in good are, in heaven, in the 
truth of their good. In the other life all are reduced to the state of having one mind, namely, that what they will they also think, and they do not think differently from what they will. But in the 
world it is otherwise, for in the world a man can think differently, and even understand differently, from what he wills; but this in order that he may be reformed, that is, may understand good though 
he wills evil, and thus may be led by his understanding to will good; but in the other life everyone is led according to his will which has been acquired in the world. * Compare the explication of these 
words in n. 8696. [REVISER] </p>

'You are not able to do it yourself alone' means without any truth from good flowing in from another source. This is clear from the meaning of 'doing it alone' - when said of God's truth, represented 
by 'Moses' - as the influx of truth from it alone, and not at the same time from any other source. The situation here may be recognized from what has been stated above in <a href="8685.htm">8685</a> about the direct influx 
of God's truth, and the direct and at the same time indirect influx of it. There it is shown that direct influx of God's truth occurs in a person's first state when he is being regenerated, but that 
influx direct and indirect occurs in the second state, that is to say, when he has been regenerated. When the influx is direct the Lord flows in indeed with good and truth, but the good is not perceived 
then, only the truth. During this time therefore he is led by truth, and not so much by good. But when the influx is at the same time indirect, the good is perceived; for indirect influx reaches down 
into a person's outward, sensory level of awareness. So it is that then the Lord leads the person through good. </p>

 In general it should be recognized that not until his actions spring from an affection 
for good has a person been regenerated, for then his will desires what is good, and he finds delight and bliss in doing it. When he attains this state his life is a life of good, and he is in 
heaven since good reigns throughout heaven. Truth however that composes faith leads a person towards good, and so towards heaven; but it does not place him in heaven. The reason for this is that in the 
next life all are formed into different communities according to the life of the will, not according to the life of the understanding; for where the will is, there the understanding is, but not vice 
versa. This is so in heaven, and it is so in hell. Those who are evil are not sent to hell until the evil of their life takes control of them; for when this takes control of them, so too does the falsity 
accompanying their evil, even as those who are governed by good are also governed there by the truth accompanying their good. All in the next life are brought at last into a state in which their 
mind is single, that is to say, the intentions of their will are in tune with their thoughts and not at variance with them. The situation is different in the world. There what a person thinks, indeed 
sees in his understanding, can be at variance with his intentions. But this enables him to be reformed; that is to say, he can understand what good is even though he intends evil, and so can be led by 
means of his understanding to intend what is good. But in the next life each person is led in accordance with the intentions he acquired when in the world. </p>

`Non potes facere illud solus tu': quod significet quod absque influxu veri ex bono aliunde, constat ex significatione `facere illud solus' cum dicitur de vero Divino, quod per `Moschen' repraesentatur, 
quod sit influxus veri ex illo solo, et non simul aliunde.  Quomodo cum hoc se habet, constare potest ex illis quae de influxu veri Divini immediato, et de influxu (c)illius immediato et simul mediato, 
supra n. 8685 dicta sunt, quod nempe influxus veri Divini immediatus sit in primo statu hominis cum regeneratur, at quod influxus immediatus et {1} mediatus sit in altero statu, nempe cum regeneratus 
est; cum influxus immediatus est, Dominus quidem influit cum bono et vero, at tunc non percipitur bonum sed verum, ideo tunc ducitur homo per verum, non ita per bonum; at cum influxus simul mediatus 
est, tunc percipitur bonum, nam influxus mediatus est in sensuale externum hominis, {2}inde est quod homo tunc per bonum ducatur a Domino. 	2 In genere sciendum est quod homo non prius regeneratus 
sit quam cum is ex affectione boni agit, nam tunc vult bonum, et ei jucundum et beatum est facere illud; {3}cum in hoc statu est, tunc vita ejus est vita boni, et in caelo est, nam universale regnans 
in caelo est bonum; verum autem quod fidei ducit hominem ad bonum, ita ad caelum, non autem sistit illum in caelo; quod ita sit, est causa quia in altera vita omnes consociantur secundum vitam voluntatis, 
non secundum vitam intellectus, nam ubi (t)est voluntas ibi est intellectus, non autem vicissim; ita in caelo, et ita in inferno; qui mali sunt non prius in infernum mittuntur quam cum in malo 
suae vitae sunt, nam cum in hoc sunt, etiam in falso sui mali sunt; similiter {4}illi qui in bono (d)sunt, etiam ibi in vero sui boni sunt; rediguntur omnes in altera vita ad eum statum ut illis una 
mens sit, nempe quod volunt ut etiam cogitent, non autem quod volunt ut aliter cogitent; in mundo autem aliter se habet, ibi potest homo aliter cogitare, {5}immo etiam aliter intelligere quam {6}vult, 
sed hoc ob causam ut {7}reformari possit, nempe intelligere bonum tametsi vult malum, et sic per intellectum duci ad velle bonum; at in altera vita quisque secundum velle suum quod in mundo comparatum 
est ducitur. 	@1 i simul$ 	@2 ideo tunc ducitur homo per bonum$ 	@3 et cum hoc$ 	@4 ac$ 	@5 et$ 	@6 velle$ 	@7 homo possit reformari$ </p>
