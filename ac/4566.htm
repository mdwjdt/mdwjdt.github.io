Verses 9-13. And God was seen by Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; 
and He called his name Israel. And God said to him, I am God Shaddai; be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall go forth from thy loins; and the 
land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. And God went up from upon him, in the place in which God spake with him. "And God was 
seen by Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him," signifies interior natural perception; "and God said to him, thy name is Jacob," signifies the quality of the Lord's external Divine 
natural; "Thy name shall no more be called Jacob," signifies that it should no longer be external only; "but Israel shall be thy name," signifies the quality of the internal natural, or the quality 
of its spiritual, which is "Israel"; "and He called his name Israel," signifies the internal natural, or the celestial spiritual of the natural; "and God said to him," signifies perception from the 
Divine; "I am God Shaddai," signifies the state of temptation past, and now Divine consolation; "be fruitful and multiply," signifies good and thence truth, Divine; "a nation and a company of nations 
shall be from thee," signifies good and the Divine forms of good; "and kings shall go forth from thy loins," signifies truths from the Divine marriage; "and the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, 
to thee I will give it," signifies Divine good natural appropriated; "and to thy seed after thee will I give the land," signifies Divine truth natural appropriated; "and God went up from upon him, 
in the place in which He spake with him," signifies the Divine in this state. </p>

Verses 9-13 And God was seen by Jacob again, when he was coming from Paddan Aram; and He blessed him. And God said to him, Your name is Jacob; your name will no longer be called Jacob, but indeed Israel 
will be your name; and He called his name Israel. And God said to him, I am God Shaddai, be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will go out from your 
loins. And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and to your seed after you I will give the land. And God went up from over him in the place where He talked to him. </p>
<p>'God 
was seen by Jacob again, when he was coming from Paddan Aram; and He blessed him' means interior natural perception. 'And God said to him, Your name is Jacob' means the nature of the Lord's external 
Divine Natural. 'Your name will no longer be called Jacob' means that it would no longer be solely external. 'But indeed Israel will be your name' means the nature of the internal natural, or the nature 
of the spiritual aspect of it, represented by 'Israel'. 'And He called his name Israel' means the internal natural or celestial-spiritual aspect of the natural. 'And God said to him' means perception 
from the Divine. 'I am God Shaddai' means a state of temptation is past, and now there is Divine comfort. 'Be fruitful and multiply' means good, and Divine truth arising out of this. 'A nation and 
a company of nations will be from you' means good and Divine forms of good. 'And kings will go out from your loins' means truths from the Divine Marriage. 'And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac 
I will give to you' means Divine Natural Good made over to Him. 'And to your seed after you I will give the land' means Divine Natural Truth made over to Him. 'And God went up from over him in the 
place where He talked to him' means the Divine within that state. </p>

Vers. 9-13.  Et visus Deus ad Jacobum adhuc, in veniendo illo e Paddan Aram, et benedixit illi.  Et dixit illi Deus, Nomen tuum Jacob, non vocabitur nomen tuum amplius Jacob, quin immo Israel erit 
nomen tuum; et vocavit nomen illius Israel.  Et dixit illi Deus, Ego te, Deus Shaddai, fructificare {1} et multiplicare, gens et coetus gentium erit e te, et reges e lumbis tuis exibunt.  Et terram 
quam dedi Abrahamo et Jishako, tibi dabo eam, et semini tuo post te dabo terram.  Et ascendit desuper illo Deus in loco quo locutus cum illo {2}. `Visus Deus ad Jacobum adhuc, in veniendo illo e 
Paddan Aram, et benedixit significat perceptionem interiorem naturalem: `et dixit illi Deus, Nomen tuum Jacob' significat quale Domini Naturale externum Divinum: `non vocabitur nomen tuum amplius Jacobus' 
significat quod non amplius solum externum: `quin immo Israel erit nomen tuum' significat quale internum naturale, seu quale spirituale illius quod Israel: `et vocavit nomen illius Israel' 
significat internum naturale, seu caeleste spirituale naturalis: `et dixit illi Deus' significat perceptionem a Divino: </p>
<p>`Ego Deus Shaddai' significat statum tentationis praeteritum et nunc Divinum 
solatium: `fructificare et multiplicare' significat bonum et inde verum Divinum: `gens et coetus gentium erit a te significat bonum et boni Divinas formas: `et reges e lumbis tuis exibunt' significat 
vera ex Divino conjugio: `et terram quam dedi Abrahamo et Jishako, tibi dabo eam' significat Divinum Bonum Naturale appropriatum: `et semini tuo post te dabo terram' significat Divinum Verum Naturale 
appropriatum: `et ascendit desuper illo Deus in loco quo locutus cum illo' significat Divinum in statu illo.      @1 sanctificare, evidently a mistake in copying, for fructificare follows later 
in [ ]$      @2 I i Deus, probably by confusion with verse 15.$ </p>
