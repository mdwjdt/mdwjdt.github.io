<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1700节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1700.</strong>创世记14:13. 有一个逃出来的人，告诉希伯来人亚伯兰，当时亚伯兰正住在亚摩利人幔利的橡树那里。幔利是以实各和亚乃的兄弟，这些就是与亚伯兰立约的人。<br />“有一个逃出来的人，告诉希伯来人亚伯兰”表主凭祂的内层人（Interior Man）发觉，因为“希伯来人亚伯兰”就是要与内在人（Internal）或神性人（Divine Man）结合的内层人。“当时亚伯兰正住在亚摩利人幔利的橡树那里”表直觉的状态出自理性人（Rational Man）。“幔利是以实各和亚乃的兄弟，这些就是与亚伯兰立约的人”表涉及外在人的理性人在其良善与真理性质方面的状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1700.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1700/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>Genesis 14:13</a>. And an escapee came and told Abram the Hebrew, and he was living in the oak groves of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these were men bound by a pact with Abram.<br />An escapee came and told Abram the Hebrew means that the Lord sensed things in his intermediate self; Abram the Hebrew is his intermediate self, linked to his inward or divine self. And he was living in the oak groves of Mamre the Amorite symbolizes the state of perception in his rational self. [Mamre was] brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were men bound by a pact with Abram symbolizes the state of his rational self (or its outward part) and the nature of its goodness and truth. </p>

Verse 13. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew, and he was dwelling in the oak-groves of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol, and the brother of Aner; and these were men 
of the covenant of Abram. "There came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew," signifies that the Lord perceived from His interior man; "Abram the Hebrew" is the interior man to which the internal 
or Divine man is adjoined; "and he was dwelling in the oak-groves of Mamre the Amorite," signifies the state of perception from the rational man; "the brother of Eshcol, and the brother of Aner, 
and these were men of the covenant of Abram," signifies the state of the rational man in respect to the external man as regards the quality of its goods and truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1700</b></p><p><b>1700.</b>
Verse 13 And one who had escaped came and told it to Abram me Hebrew; and he was dwelling among me oak-groves of Mamre the Amorite, me brother of Eshkol, and me brother of Aner; and these men were Abram's 
allies. </p>
<p>'One who had escaped came and told it to Abram the Hebrew' means that the Lord perceived from His Interior Man, 'Abram the Hebrew' being the Interior Man to whom the Internal or Divine 
Man was joined. 'And he was dwelling among the oak-groves of Mamre the Amorite' means the state of perception coming from the Rational Man. 'The brother of Eshkol and the brother of Aner, and these 
men were Abram's allies' means the state of the Rational Man in relation to the External Man as regards the nature of its goods and truths. </p>

Vers. 13.  Et venit evasor, et indicavit Abramo Hebraeo, et is habitans in quercetis Mamre Emoraei, fratris Eshkoli, et fratris Aneri; et hi viri foederis Abrami.  'Venit evasor et indicavit Abram Hebraeo' 
significat quod perciperet Dominus ex Interiore Ipsius Homine; 'Abram Hebraeus' est Interior Homo cui adjunctus Internus seu Divinus: 'et is habitans in quercetis Mamre Emoraei' significat statum 
perceptionis ex Rationali Homine: (x)'fratris Eshkoli et fratris Aneri, et hi viri foederis Abrami' significat statum Rationalis Homini quoad Externum, ejus bona et vera qualia essent. </p>
