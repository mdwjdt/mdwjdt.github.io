<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9285节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9285.</strong>出埃及记23:14-19.一年三次，你要向我守节。你要守无酵饼节，照我所吩咐你的，在亚笔月内所定的日期，吃无酵饼七天。因为你是这月出了埃及，不可空手朝见我的面。又要守你劳作初熟之物的收割节，就是你在田间所播种的；并在年底收集你从田间劳作所得时，要守收集节。你一切的男丁要一年三次朝见主耶和华的面。不可将我祭牲的血和有酵之物一同献上，也不可将我节上的脂肪留过夜到早晨。地里首先初熟之物要送到耶和华你神的殿。不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔。<br />“一年三次，你要向我守节”表由于从诅咒中释放而持续敬拜主并感恩。“你要守无酵饼节”表由于从虚假中洁净而敬拜和感恩。“七天”表那时的一种神圣状态。“吃无酵饼”表将从虚假中洁净的良善变成他们自己的。“照我所吩咐你的”表照着秩序的律法。“在亚笔月内所定的日期”表从一个新状态的开始。“因为你是这月出了埃及”表从虚假的侵扰中得释放。“不可空手朝见我的面”表出于怜悯对良善的接受，以及感恩。“又要守你劳作初熟之物的收割节，就是你在田间所播种的”表由于真理在那良善中的植入而敬拜主和感恩。“并在年底收集你从田间劳作所得时，要守收集节”表由于之后良善的植入，因而由于重生和从诅咒中完全释放而出于感恩之心的敬拜。“你一切的男丁要一年三次朝见主耶和华的面”表主的不断显现和同在，因此祂的显现和同在也在信之真理中。“不可将我祭牲的血和有酵之物一同献上”表由教会的真理所产生的对主的敬拜决不能与邪恶所产生的虚假混在一起。“也不可将我节上的脂肪留过夜到早晨”表并非源于人的自我，而是来自主的敬拜之良善总是新的。“地里首先初熟之物要送到耶和华你神的殿”表良善的一切真理和真理的一切良善都是神圣的，因为它们唯独来自主。“不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔”表属于后一种状态的纯真之良善绝不能与属于前一种状态的纯真之真理相结合。</p>

Verses 14-19. Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year. The feast of unleavened things shalt thou keep; seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed 
of the month Abib; because in it thou camest forth out of Egypt; and My faces shall not be seen empty: and the feast of the harvest of the first fruits of thy works, which thou sowedst in the 
field; and the feast of ingathering, in the going out of the year, when thou gatherest in thy works out of the field. Three times in the year shall every male of thine appear before the faces of the Lord 
Jehovih. Thou shalt not sacrifice the blood of My sacrifice upon what is fermented; and the fat of My feast shall not remain overnight until the morning. The first of the firstfruits of thy ground 
thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk. "Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year," signifies the persistent worship of the 
Lord and thanksgiving on account of liberation from damnation; "the feast of unleavened things shalt thou keep," signifies worship and thanksgiving on account of purification from falsities; "seven days," 
signifies a holy state then; "thou shalt eat unleavened things," signifies the appropriation of good purified from falsities; "as I commanded thee," signifies in accordance with the laws of order; 
"at the time appointed of the month Abib," signifies from the beginning of a new state; "because in it thou camest forth out of Egypt," signifies liberation from infestation by falsities; "and My faces 
shall not be seen empty," signifies the reception of good by virtue of mercy, and thanksgiving; "and the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of thy works, which thou sowedst in the field," signifies 
the worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of the implanting of truth in good; "and the feast of ingathering, in the going out of the year, when thou gatherest in thy works out of the 
field," signifies worship from a grateful mind on account of the implantation of good therefrom, thus on account of regeneration and complete liberation from damnation; "three times in the year shall 
every male of thine appear before the faces of the Lord Jehovih," signifies the continual appearance and presence of the Lord, therefore also His appearance and presence in the truths of faith; "thou 
shalt not sacrifice the blood of My sacrifice upon what is fermented," signifies that the worship of the Lord from the truths of the church must not be commingled with falsities from evil; "and the fat 
of My feast shall not remain overnight until the morning," signifies the good of worship, not from man's own, but from the Lord, always new; "the first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring 
into the house of Jehovah thy God," signifies that all truths of good and goods of truth are holy, because they are from the Lord alone; "thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk," signifies 
that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state. </p>

Verses 14-19 Three times you shall keep a feast to Me in the year. You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread (seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of 
the month Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; and My face shall not be seen empty-handed<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>); and the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of your labours, which you have sown in the field; and 
the feast of ingathering at the end<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the year, when you have gathered in [the fruit of] your labours from the field. Three times in the year all your males shall be seen at the face of the Lord Jehovah. 
You shall not sacrifice the blood of My sacrifice with anything made with yeast;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> and the fat of My feast shall not remain through the night until morning. The first of the firstfruits of your 
ground you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk.  </p>
<p>'Three times you shall keep a feast to Me in the year' means enduring worship of the Lord 
and thanksgiving on account of deliverance from damnation. 'You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread' means worship and thanksgiving on account of purification from falsities. 'Seven days' means 
a holy state then. 'You shall eat unleavened bread' means making good purified from falsities their own. 'As I commanded you' means in keeping with the laws of order. 'At the appointed time of the month 
Abib' means from the beginning of a new state. 'For in it you came out of Egypt' means deliverance from molestation by falsities. 'And My face shall not be seen empty-handed' means the reception of 
good out of mercy, and thanksgiving. 'And the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of your labours, which you have sown in the field' means worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of the 
implanting of truth in that good. 'And the feast of ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in [the fruit of] your labours from the field' means the worship of a thankful mind on account 
of the implanting of good after that, and so on account of regeneration and complete deliverance from damnation. 'Three times in the year all your males shall be seen at the face of the Lord Jehovah' 
means the Lord's constant appearance and presence in like manner in the truths of faith as well. 'You shall not sacrifice the blood of My sacrifice with anything made with yeast' means that worship 
of the Lord arising from the Church's truths must not be mingled together with falsities arising from evil. 'And the fat of My feast shall not remain through the night until morning' means the good 
of worship, which does not originate in the self but comes from the Lord and is always new. 'The first of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God' means that 
every truth of good and every good of truth is holy because it comes from the Lord alone. 'You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk' means that the good of innocence belonging to a later state 
must not be joined to the truth of innocence belonging to an earlier state.

Vers. 14-19. Tribus vicibus feriaberis Mihi in anno. Festum azymorum custodies; septem diebus comedes azyma, quemadmodum praecepi tibi, ad statum tempus mensis Abib, quia in eo exivisti ex Aegypto; et 
non videbuntur facies Meae vacue. Et festum messis, primitiarum operum tuorum, quae seminaveras in agro; et festum collectionis in exitu anni, in colligendo te opera tua ex agro. Tribus vicibus in anno 
videbitur omnis masculus tuus ad facies Domini Jehovae. Non sacrificabis super fermentato sanguinem sacrificii Mei, et non pernoctabit adeps festi Mei usque ad mane.  Primum primitiarum humi tuae 
introduces domum Jehovae Dei tui; non coques haedum in lacte matris suae. `Tribus vicibus feriaberis Mihi in anno' significat cultum Domini et gratiarum actionem permanentem ob liberationem a damnatione: 
`festum azymorum custodies' (x)significat cultum et gratiarum actionem ob purificationem a falsis: `septem diebus' (x)significat statum sanctum tunc: `comedes azyma' significat appropriationem boni 
purificati a falsis: `quemadmodum praecepi tibi' significat secundum leges ordinis: `ad statum tempus mensis Abib' significat a principio status novi {1}: `quia in eo exivisti ex Aegypto' significat 
liberationem ab infestatione a falsis: et non videbuntur facies Meae vacue' significat receptionem (x)boni ex misericordia et gratiarum actionem: `et festum messis primitiarum operum tuorum, quae (x)seminaveras 
in agro' significat cultum (o)Domini et gratiarum actionem propter implantationem veri in bono: `et festum collectionis in exitu anni, in colligendo te opera tua ex agro' significat cultum 
ex grato animo ob implantationem boni inde, ita ob regenerationem ac plenariam liberationem a damnatione: `tribus vicibus in anno videbitur omnis masculus tuus ad facies Domini Jehovae' significat continuam 
apparentiam et praesentiam Domini sic etiam in veris quae fidei: `non sacrificabis super fermentato sanguinem sacrificii Mei' significat quod cultus Domini ex veris Ecclesiae non commiscendus 
sit cum falsis ex malo: `et non pernoctabit adeps festi Mei usque ad mane' significat bonum cultus non ex proprio sed a Domino semper novum: `primum primitiarum humi tuae introduces in domum Jehovae Dei 
tui significat quod omnia vera boni et bona veri sancta sint quia a solo Domino: `non coques haedum in lacte matris suae' significat quod bonum innocentiae posterioris status non conjungendum sit cum 
vero innocentiae prioris status. {2} @1 i (n. 8053)$ @2 A has the following note here: sicut quod tunc ex innocentia amanda mundana terrestria, parentes, magistri, et similia$ </p>
