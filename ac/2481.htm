<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2481节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2481.</strong>我通过大量经历得知，死后的人，也就是灵人没有失去属于其外部或肉体记忆的任何东西，反而保留该记忆的一切，也就是说，保留整个外部记忆或肉体记忆，尽管他们不可以从中提取出其生活细节。这一点从下面的例子可以看出来：有两个人活在肉身时是我所认识的，并且彼此为敌，他们相遇了。我听见其中一个人用很多情节描述了对方的秉性，还告知对他曾持有的看法，并完整重述了他曾写给对方的一封信，以及一系列的很多其它事，这些事都是些细节，属于外部记忆。对方承认了这一切，并对此保持沉默，没有发表任何评论。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2481</b></p><p><b>2481.</b>
That men after death, that is, spirits, have lost nothing whatever of the things which belong to their external or corporeal memory; but that they retain all things of it (that is to say, they retain 
the whole of it), although it is not permitted to bring forth from it the particulars* of their life, has been given me to know from much experience, as may be seen from what follows. Two persons whom 
I had known during their life in the body, and who had been enemies to each other, met; and I heard one describing the character of the other with many circumstances, and also telling what opinion he 
had had of him, repeating an entire letter that he had written to him, and many other things in series which were particulars, and that belonged to the exterior memory; all of which the other acknowledged, 
and at which he was silent. * By "particulars" Swedenborg here means such things as the words of natural languages, the names of men, and of cities, together with other similar merely external 
matters. See this plainly stated in the Spiritual Experiences, n.2285. [Reviser.] </p>

That people after death, that is, spirits, have lost nothing at all of the things which constitute their exterior or physical memory, but retain the whole, or every part of it, though they are not allowed 
to summon up from it the particulars of their life, I have been given to know from much experience, as may become clear from the following incidents: Two people whom I had known during their lifetime, 
and who had been enemies, met each other. I heard one describing the other's character with many episodes, also describing the opinion he had formed of him. He repeated an entire letter which he 
had written to him, as well as many other points in succession which were particulars and belonged to his exterior memory, which the other person acknowledged but without making any comment. </p>

</p><b>2481.</b>
Quod homines post mortem, hoc est, spiritus, ne hilum amiserint ex illis quae sunt memoriae eorum exterioris seu corporeae, sed quod omnia ejus, seu quod omnem, secum habeant, tametsi ex illa particularia 
vitae suae producere non licet, ex multa experientia mihi nosse datum est: ut constare potest a sequentibus.  Bini quos novi {1} in vita corporis eorum, convenerunt, qui inter se inimici, audivi 
unum describentem alterius genium cum multis {2} circumstantiis, tum qualem opinionem de eo habuerat, recitans integram epistolam quam ad eum scripsit, et plura in serie, quae particularia et memoriae 
exterior erant, quae alter agnovit et ad quae conticuit. 	@1 noveram.$ 	@2 pluribus.$ </p>
