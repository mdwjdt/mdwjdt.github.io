<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1388.</strong>另一种直觉是所有人共有的，最完美的天使，以及灵人们根据各自品质都拥有这种直觉，如前所述。它在于别人一靠近，人就知道他的品性，即使他没有开口说一句话。他通过某种奇妙的流注立刻显明自己。善灵不仅通过其善良，还通过那里的信，以及说话时所用的每个词被辨别出来；而恶灵则通过其恶毒、不信，以及说话时所用的每个词被辨别出来。他们被辨别得如此清楚，以至于毫无差池。类似现象也出现在世人中，他们有时同样能从别人的表情和言谈举止知道他在想什么，哪怕他嘴上说的相反。人的这种洞察力是属世的，不过，它的来源和特性来自灵人的性质，因而来自这个人自己的灵，以及他与灵人界的交流。这种交流的直觉始于主的意愿，即一切良善都是可交流的，所有人都应被相爱所激励，从而获得幸福。正因如此，这种直觉普遍存在于灵人中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1388.</strong> The second kind of perception, as already mentioned [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1388/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1383" target=_top>1383</a>], is one that is common to everyone — to angels at the peak of perfection and to spirits according to their quality. As soon as another person approaches, they know what that person is like, even if the person says nothing. It reveals itself instantaneously, by a sort of inspiration that is most amazing. Good spirits are recognized not only for the type of goodness they have but also for the type of belief. When they talk, it comes through in every word. Evil spirits are recognized for their wickedness and unbelief, and when they talk, it comes through in every word. The clues are so plain as to be unmistakable.<br />Something similar can be seen with people on earth. They too can sometimes tell what others are thinking from the gestures, facial expression, and speech of those others, even when their words contradict it. This skill in humans is an innate one whose origin can be traced to a character trait in spirits that grants them the same ability, and so to an individual's own spirit and its communication with the world of spirits. This shared perception originates in the Lord's wish that all blessings spread contagiously and that everyone enjoy mutual love and grow happy as a result. That is why this type of perception also prevails everywhere among spirits. </p>

The second kind of perception, as has been said, is what is common to all, in the highest perfection to angels, and to spirits according to their quality. It consists in knowing the quality of another 
at his first approach, even if he does not speak. He manifests himself forthwith by a certain wonderful influx. It is known of a good spirit, not only of what goodness he is, but also of what faith; 
and when he speaks, this is known from every word. Of an evil spirit it is known of what evil he is and of what unbelief; and when he speaks, this is known from every word, and so manifestly that there 
can be no mistake. Something similar appears with men, who likewise can sometimes know from another's gesture, looks, or speech, what he is thinking, even although it is contrary to what he says; and 
this knowledge is natural to man, deriving its origin and character from the nature of spirits, and thus from the spirit of the man himself, and its communication with the world of spirits. This communicative 
perception has its beginning in the fact that the Lord wills that all goods may be communicable, and that all may be affected by mutual love, and so be happy. Hence such a perception reigns 
universally also among spirits. </p>

The second kind of perception, as has been stated, is common to all, existing with angels to the height of perfection, and with spirits according to the particular character of each one; that is to say, 
they know the character of another as soon as he approaches, even when he does not say a word. It shows itself immediately by means of a certain remarkable influx. A good spirit is recognized not 
only from the goodness within him but also from the faith there, and from each word he uses as he is speaking, while a wicked spirit is recognized from his wickedness and unbelief, and from each word 
he uses as he is speaking. They are recognized so plainly that one could never be mistaken. Something similar occurs among men who likewise, from another person's gestures, looks, and speech, are sometimes 
able to know what he is thinking, even though something different is expressed in his speech. With man such knowledge is natural, but it has its origin in and receives its character from that which 
exists in spirits, and so from the spirit of the individual himself and from his communication with the world of spirits. This communicative perception from this source derives in the first place 
from the Lord's will that all goods should be communicable and that all people should be stirred by mutual love and so be happy. This being so, such perception reigns universally among spirits also. </p>

</p><b>1388.</b>
Alterum genus perceptionis est, ut dictum, quod commune est omnibus, angelis in summa perfectione, et spiritibus secundum qualitatem ejus, quod nempe ad primum adventum alterius sciant qualis est, etiamsi 
nihil loquatur; manifestat se ilico per influxum quendam mirabilem; noscitur spiritus qua non solum qua bonitate est sed etiam qua fide, dumque loquitur, ex singulis vocibus; spiritus malus, qua 
malitia et qua infidelitate, dumque loquitur, ex singulis vocibus; et hoc tam manifeste ut nusquam fallat.  Aliquod simile apparet apud homines, qui quoque ex alterius gestu, vultu, loquela, nosse quandoque 
possunt quid cogitat, tametsi loquela aliter testatur; quae scientia apud hominem est naturalis, trahens originem a spirituum indole quod talis, sic ab ipsius hominis spiritu, et ejus communicatione 
cum mundo spirituum; perceptio haec communicativa inde ducit suum principium quod Dominus velit ut omnia bona sint communicabilia et quod omnes ex amore mutuo afficiantur et sic felices sint; inde 
talis perceptio inter spiritus quoque universaliter regnat. </p>
