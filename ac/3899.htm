<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3899节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3899.</strong>马太福音这一章的前几节论述的主题是教会的逐渐毁灭。也就是说，首先人们开始不再知道何为良善与真理，反而就此彼此争辩；之后他们蔑视它们；第三个阶段，他们不承认它们；第四个阶段，他们亵渎之（参看<a href="3754.htm">3754</a>节）。但现在所论述的主题是教会中普遍教导的教义种类，也就是口头上以神圣和崇敬的方式赞美主，而内心却拜自我和尘世，以至于对他们来说，拜主只是他们借以获得名利的手段之人所教导的教义种类。当他们的敬拜变成这个样子时，他们在何种程度上承认主，承认天上的生活和信仰，就在何种程度上亵渎它们。教会的这种状态就是现在所论述的主题，这一点从上面所引用主的话的内义看得更清楚，内义如下。</p>

In what precedes in this chapter of Matthew the successive vastation of the church has been treated of-that they should first begin no longer to know what good and truth are, but should dispute about 
them; next that they should despise them; thirdly that they should not acknowledge them; and fourthly that they should profane them (see n. 3754). The subject now treated of is the state of the church 
in respect to its quality at that time as to doctrine in general, and with those specifically who are in holy external worship, but in profane internal worship; that is, who with the mouth profess the 
Lord with holy reverence, but at heart worship themselves and the world, so that with them the worship of the Lord is a means of gaining honors and wealth. Insofar as these persons have acknowledged 
the Lord, and the heavenly life and faith, so far do they profane them when they become of such a character. This state of the church is now treated of, as may better appear from the internal sense 
of the Lord's words quoted above, which is as follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3899</b></p><p><b>3899.</b>
The subject in the verses prior to these in this chapter of Matthew was the progressive ruination of the Church. That is to say, first of all people ceased to know any longer what good or truth was, 
and instead began to argue with one another about these; after that they treated them with contempt; then in a third phase they did not acknowledge them; and in a fourth they profaned them, see <a href="3754.htm">3754</a>. 
But now the subject is the kind of doctrine that is taught generally in the Church, and especially by those whose worship is outwardly holy but inwardly profane; that is, those who with their lips praise 
the Lord in holy and reverent ways, but in their hearts they worship self and the world, so that for them worshipping the Lord is a means by which they gain position and wealth. When this is what 
their worship becomes, then to the extent they have come to acknowledge the Lord, the heavenly life and faith, they profane the same. This state of the Church is the subject now, as may be seen more clearly 
from the internal sense of the Lord's words quoted above, which is as follows: </p>

Actum est in illis quae praecedunt in hoc capite apud Matthaeum de successiva vastatione Ecclesiae, quod nempe primum non amplius inciperent scire quid bonum et verum, sed litigarent de illis; dein 
quod contemnerent illa; tertio quod non agnoscerent; </p>
<p>quarto quod profanarent, videatur n. 3754; nunc agitur de stata Ecclesiae qualis est `tunc' quoad doctrinam in communi, et apud illos in specie 
qui in sancto cultu externo, sed in profano interno sunt, hoc est, qui ore profitentur Dominum cum sancta veneratione, sed corde se colunt et mundum, sic ut cultus Domini illis sit pro medio lucrandi 
honores et opes; illi quantum agnoverunt Dominum, caelestem vitam et fidem, tantum, cum tales fiunt, profanant.  De hoc statu Ecclesiae nunc agitur; ut melius constare potest a sensu interno 
verborum Domini quae supra allata sunt; qui talis {1}. @1 i est$ </p>
