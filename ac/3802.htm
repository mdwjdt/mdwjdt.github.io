Verses 12, 13. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father. And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob, his sister's 
son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Laban all these words. "And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother," signifies 
the affinity of the good which is "Jacob" and of the good which is " Laban;" "and that he was Rebekah's son," signifies the conjunction of these affinities; "and she ran and told her father," signifies 
acknowledgment by means of interior truths; "and it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son," signifies the acknowledgment of the related good; "that he ran to meet 
him," signifies agreement; "and embraced him," signifies affection; "and kissed him," signifies initiation; "and brought him to his house," signifies to conjunction; "and he told Laban all these words," 
signifies from truths. </p>

Verses 12, 13 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father. And so it was, when Laban heard the news about Jacob his sister's 
son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 'Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother' means the kinship 
of the good represented by 'Jacob' and of the good represented by 'Laban'. 'And that he was Rebekah's son' means the link between these kindred varieties of good. 'And she ran and told her father' means 
acknowledgement by means of interior truths. 'And so it was, when Laban heard the news about Jacob his sister's son' means an acknowledgement of the kindred good. 'That he ran to meet him' means 
agreement. 'And embraced him' means affection. 'And kissed him' means the initial stage. 'And brought him to his house' means to their being joined together. 'And he told Laban all these things' means 
from truths. </p>

Vers. 12, 13.  Et indicabat Jacob Racheli, quod frater patris ejus ille, et quod filius Rebeccae ille, et cucurrit et indicavit patri suo.  Et fuit, sicut audivit Laban famam Jacobi filii sororis 
suae, et cucurrit obviam ei, et amplexus eum, et osculatus eum, et adduxit eum ad domum suam, et narravit Labani omnia verba illa. `Indicabat Jacob Racheli, quod frater patris ejus ille' significat

<p>`et quod filius Rebeccae ille' significat affinitatum conjunctionem: `et cucurrit et indicavit patri suo' significat agnitionem per interiora vera: 
`et fuit, sicut audivit Laban famam Jacobi filii sororis suae' significat agnitionem boni affinis: `et cucurrit obviam ei' significat convenientiam: `et amplexus eum' significat affectionem: `et 
osculatus eum' significat initiationem: </p>
