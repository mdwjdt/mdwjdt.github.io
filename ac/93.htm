<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>93.</strong>主在以西结书如此描述了属天之人的状态——他获得了宁静（因雨雾而清宁），脱离了邪恶与虚假的奴役：“我必与他们立平安的约，使恶兽从境内断绝，他们就必安居在旷野，躺卧在林中。我必使他们与我山的四围成为福源，我也必叫时雨落下，必有福如甘霖而降。田间的树必结果，地也必有出产。他们必在故土安然居住。我折断他们所负的轭，救他们脱离那以他们为奴之人的手。那时，他们就知道我是耶和华……你们作我的羊，我草场上的羊，乃是以色列人，我也是你们的神。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.25.htm">34:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.31.htm">31</a>）<br />这事成就在“第三日”，在圣经中，“三”与“七”有着同样的象征义，何西阿书如此宣告说：“过两天他必使我们苏醒，第三天他必使我们兴起，我们就在他面前得以存活。我们务要认识耶和华，竭力追求认识他。他出现确如晨光，他必临到我们像甘雨，像滋润田地的春雨。”（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.2.htm">6:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以西结书在描述古教会时，将该状态比作“田间的生长物”：“我使你增多，好像田间的生长物，你就渐渐长大，以致极其俊美。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.7.htm">16:7</a>）抑或比作：“我种的栽子，我手的工作。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.21.htm">60:21</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]93.</strong> Here is how the Lord, through Ezekiel, depicts the circumstances of a heavenly person who has been gifted with peace and calm, created anew by the rain, and delivered from enslavement to evil and falsity:<br />I will strike a pact of peace with them and bring an end on the earth to the evil wild animal; and they will live securely in the wilderness and sleep in forests. And I will make them — and the environs of my hill — a blessing and cause the rain to fall in its season; showers of blessing there will be. And the tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its produce, and they will be secure on their own ground; and they will know that I am Jehovah, in that I have broken the straps of their yoke and freed them from the hand of those forcing them to serve them. You are my flock, the flock of my pasture, you are humankind; I am your God.

His emergence has been prepared like the dawn, and he will come like rain to us, like the late rain watering the earth.

The state of the celestial man, thus gifted with the tranquility of peace-refreshed by the rain-and delivered from the slavery of what is evil and false, is thus described by the Lord in Ezekiel:    
 I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and they shall dwell confidently in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods; and I will make them 
and the places round about My hill a blessing; and I will cause the rain to come down in his season; rains of blessing shall they be. And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall 
yield its increase, and they shall be upon their ground in confidence, and shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the reins of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that 
make them to serve them; and ye My flock, the flock of My pasture, ye are a man, and I am your God (Ezek. 34:25-27, 31). And that this is effected on the "third day" which in the Word signifies the 
same as the "seventh" is thus declared in Hosea: </p>
<p>     After two days will He vivify us; in the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live before Him and we shall know, and shall follow on to 
know Jehovah: His going forth is prepared as the dawn, and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the late rain watering the earth (Hos. 6:2-3). And that this state is compared to the "growth of the field" 
is declared by Ezekiel, when speaking of the Ancient Church: </p>
<p>I have caused thee to multiply as the growth of the field, and thou hast increased and hast grown up, and hast come to excellent ornaments 
(Ezek. 16:7). And it is also compared to:       A shoot of the Lord's planting, and a work of the hands of Jehovah God (Isa. 60:21). </p>

This state of the celestial man who has been granted the serenity of peace, who has been recreated by the rain, and freed from the slavery of evil and falsity, the Lord describes through Ezekiel as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
will make with them a covenant of peace and I will banish the evil wild animal from the land, and they will dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods, and I will give them and 
the places around My hill a blessing, and I will cause the rain to descend in its season. They will be showers of blessing. And the tree of the field will give its fruit, and the earth will give its 
increase, and they will be there with confidence on their land, and they will know that I am Jehovah, that I will break the bars of their yoke, and I will free them from the hand of those who enslave 
them. You are My flock, the flock of My pasture. You are man, I am your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:25-27,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:25-27, 31</a>.   
</blockquote>
And through Hosea He describes the attainment of this on the third day, which has the same meaning 
in the Word as the seventh,    He will revive us after two days, on the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live before Him. And we shall know, and we shall press on to know Jehovah. Ready 
as the dawn is His going forth, and He will come to us like the rain, like the latter rain that waters the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%206:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 6:2, 3</a>.   And through Ezekiel, when the Ancient Church is the subject, the attainment 
of that state is compared to the seed of the field,   I gave you to be like the seed of the field; and you grew up and became tall and reached full beauty. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:7</a>.   It is also compared 
to  </p>
<blockquote>
The shoot of plantings, and the work of the hands of Jehovah God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:11</a>.

Statum hominis caelestis donati tranquillitate pacis, recreati: per pluviam, et liberati a servitute mali et falsi, ita describit Dominus per Ezechielem, 	Pangam illis foedus pacis, et cessare faciam 
feram malam terra, et habitabant in deserto confidenter, et dormient in silvis; et dabo illos, et circuitus collis Mei, benedictionem, et descende faciam pluviam in tempore suo; pluviae benedictionis 
erunt; dabit arbor agri fructum suum, et terra dabit proventum suum et erunt super humo sua in confidentia, et scient quod Ego Jehovah, quod fregero lora jugi eorum, et liberavero eos e manu facientium 
servire sibi eos:...vos grex Meus, grex pascui Mei homo vos, Ego Deus vester, xxxiv 25-27, 31: </p>
<p>et quod hoc fiat tertio die, qui idem in Verbo significat ac septimus {1} per Hosheam, 	Vivificabit 
nos a duobus diebus, in die tertio suscitabit nos et vivemus coram Ipso; et sciemus, et sequemur ad sciendi 	Jehovam; sicut aurora paratus egressus {2} Ipsius, et veniet sic pluvia nobis, sicut pluvia 
serotina irrigans terram, vi 	2, 3: </p>
<p>quodque hoc comparetur germini agri, per Ezechielem ubi de Antiqua Ecclesia, 		Sicut germen agri dedi te, et crevisti, et adolevisti, et venisti in decora decorum, 
xvi 7: </p>
<p>tum 	Surculo plantationum, et operi manuum Jehovae Dei, Esai.lx 21. @	1 Septimum 1.$ @	2 Sch. has exitus over which S. wrote exortus in his copy, but here he prefers egressus.$
