<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6757节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6757.</strong>“看他们的重担”表对他们正被虚假侵扰的一种洞察。这从“看”和“重担”的含义清楚可知：“看”是指洞察，如前所述（<a href="6732.htm">6732</a>节）；“重担”是指被虚假侵扰，因为就灵义而言，法老压在以色列人身上的重担并非别的。“法老”是指虚假的记忆知识（<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>节）；虚假的侵扰对那些处于真理的人来说，无非是“重担”。至于虚假的侵扰，也就是那些处于真理之人的重担是何性质，人只要活在世上，就不可能知道；因为这时，他没有遭受这种侵扰。他在世时，其心智要么粘附于虚假，要么驱散它们，没有感觉到任何侵扰。但在来世，当那些处于真理的人被虚假侵扰时，他们被恶灵置于虚假的控制之下，就像被囚的人。但主将其心智的内层保守在真理中，这些真理用来驱散虚假。诸如存在于来世的虚假侵扰状态就是此处在内义上所指的，如许多其它一样；因为圣言不只是为世人写的，也是为灵人和天使写的。</p>

And saw their burdens. That this signifies a noticing that they were infested by falsities, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to notice (of which above, n. 6732); and from the signification 
of "burdens," as being infestations by falsities; for the burdens which were laid upon the sons of Israel by Pharaoh are in the spiritual sense nothing else. "Pharaoh" denotes false memory-knowledge 
(n. 6651, 6679, 6683); and infestation by falsities are nothing else than burdens to those who are in truths. How the case is with infestations by falsities, which are burdens to those who 
are in truths, cannot be known by man during his life in the world; for he is not then so infested, because his mind then either cleaves to falsities or shakes them off, and this without infestation 
being felt. But in the other life, when those who are in truths are infested by falsities, they are then held by evil spirits as it were bound in them; but the interiors of the mind are held in truths 
by the Lord, by which truths the falsities are shaken off. The state of infestations by falsities, such as exists in the other life, is here meant in the internal sense, as are many other things; for 
the Word has been written not for man only, but also for spirits and angels. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6757</b></p><p><b>6757.</b>
'And saw their burdens' means a discernment that they were being molested by falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as a discernment, dealt with above in <a href="6772.htm">6772</a>; and from the meaning of 
'burdens' as molestations by falsities, for in the spiritual sense the burdens laid by Pharaoh on the children of Israel are nothing else. 'Pharaoh' is false factual knowledge, <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, <a href="6679.htm">6679</a>, <a href="6683.htm">6683</a>; and molestations 
by falsities are nothing other than 'burdens' to those who are guided by truths. As for the nature of molestations by falsities, which are 'burdens' to those guided by truths, that cannot 
be known by anyone while he lives in the world, for he does not suffer that kind of molestation then. While he is in the world his mind either clings to falsities or dispels them, without any conscious 
feeling of molestation. But in the next life when those guided by truths suffer molestation by falsities they are held by evil spirits in the grip of those falsities like people in bonds. But the Lord 
holds the interior parts of their minds in truths, which are used to dispel the falsities. A state of molestation by falsities such as is experienced in the next life is what is meant here in the internal 
sense, as are many other things; for the Word has been written not only for man but also for spirits and angels. </p>

</p><b>6757.</b>
`Et vidit onera illorum': quod significet apperceptionem quod infestarentur a falsis, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit apperceptio, de qua supra n. 6732; et ex significatione `onerum' quod 
sint infestationes a falsis; onera enim quae filiis Israelis {1}a Pharaone imponebantur in sensu spirituali non aliud sunt; `Pharao' {2} est scientificum falsum, n. 6651, 6679, 6683; infestationes a 
falsis nec aliud quam `onera' sunt illis qui in veris sunt.  Quomodo infestationes a falsis, quae sunt onera illis qui in veris sunt, se habent, non sciri potest ab homine dum vivit in mundo, nam tunc 
non infestatur ita, vel enim mens ejus tunc adhaeret falsis, vel discutit illa, et hoc absque infestatione sensibili; at in altera vita cum illi qui in veris infestantur a falsis, tunc tenentur a spiritibus 
malis in illis sicut vincti, at interiora mentis in veris a Domino, per quae discutiuntur falsa; status infestationum a falsis qualis est in altera vita, hic in sensu interno intelligitur, sicut 
plura alia; nam Verbum non modo scriptum est pro homine sed etiam pro spiritibus et angelis. 	@1 After imponebantur$ 	@2 i enim$ </p>
