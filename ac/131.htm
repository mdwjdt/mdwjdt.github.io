<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（四）经文18-25节</h4><br />（18）耶和华神说，那人独居不好，我要为他造一个看似属于他的帮手。<br />（19）耶和华神用土所造成的田间各样走兽和空中各样飞鸟都带到那人面前，看他叫什么。那人怎样叫各样的活物，那就是它的名字。<br />（20）那人便给一切牲畜和空中飞鸟、田间走兽都起了名，只是那人没有遇见配偶帮助他。<br />（21）耶和华神使他沉睡，他就睡了，于是取下他的一条肋骨，又把肉合起来。<br />（22）耶和华神就用那人身上所取的肋骨，造成一个女人，领她到那人跟前。<br />（23）那人说，现在，这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，可以称她为女人，因为她是从男人身上取出来的。<br />（24）因此，人要离开父母与妻子连合，二人成为一个肉体。<br />（25）当时夫妻二人赤身露体，并不羞耻。<br /><br /><h4 align="center">（五）概览</h4><br /><strong>131.</strong>这里论述的是上古教会的后代。他们渴望自我。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]131.</strong> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_1-25" target=_top>Genesis 2</a> continued]<br />18. And Jehovah God said, "It is not good for the human to be alone. Let me make him an aid that seems to be his."{*5} 19. And out of the soil Jehovah God formed every animal of the field and every bird in the heavens and brought it to the human to see what he would call it. And whatever the human called the living soul, that was its name.<br />20. And the human gave names to every beast and to the bird in the heavens and to every wild animal of the field; but for the human no aid was found that seemed to be his.<br />21. And Jehovah God made slumber fall on the human, and he went to sleep. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.<br />22. And Jehovah God built a woman out of the rib that he took from the human and brought her to the human.<br />23. And the human said, "This time, bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. This is why she will be called ‘wife': because she was taken from man."{*6} 24. Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh.<br />25. And they were both naked, the human and his wife, and did not blush.<br />131. Summary<br />THESE verses deal with later generations of the earliest church, who strove for autonomy.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Since Swedenborg is describing a pseudo-wisdom that sees west as east, so to speak, he reverses the order of the rivers mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_11-14" target=_top>Genesis 2:11-14</a>. The fourth, the Phrath or Euphrates, becomes the first; the third, in Assyria, becomes the second; the second, in Cush, becomes the third; and the first becomes the last. [LHC, JSR]<br />{*2} For a reference to such false wisdom as magic, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_47_8-15" target=_top>Isaiah 47:8-15</a>. [LHC]<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>. [LHC]<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_247" target=_top>247</a> below. [JSR]<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_18" target=_top>Genesis 2:18</a>). The Latin phrase here translated "an aid that seems to be his," auxilium tanquam apud illum, has numerous possible meanings. This English rendering is based on Swedenborg's clarification in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_140" target=_top>140</a>. [LHC]<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_23" target=_top>Genesis 2:23</a>). The point of the elliptical expression "This time, bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh" is that in this current act of creation, God has created bone from Adam's bones and flesh from his flesh, as opposed to what Adam was offered as companions before — that is, the animals, who were not from his bone and flesh. The derivation of the word "wife" described in the rest of the verse depends upon the Hebrew, in which the word for man (or husband) is אִישׁ ('îš), while that for wife (or woman) is אִישָּׁה ('îššā), so that the word for the latter seems to be "taken from" the former. Many English versions of the Bible express the wordplay by rendering the verse thus: "She shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_23" target=_top>Genesis 2:23</a>).

THE CONTENTS.      The posterity of the Most Ancient Church, which inclined to their Own,* is here treated of. * The Latin word proprium is the term used in the original text that in this and other 
places has been rendered by the expression "Own." The dictionary meaning of propius, as an adjective, is "one's own" "proper" "belonging to one's self alone" "special" "particular" "peculiar." The neuter 
of this which is the word proprium, when used as a noun means "possession" "property;" also "a peculiarity" "characteristic mark" "distinguishing sign" "characteristic." The English adjective "own" 
is defined by Webster to mean "belonging to" "belonging exclusively or especially to" "peculiar;" so that our word "own" is a very exact equivalent of proprius, and if we make it a noun by writing 
it "Own" in order to answer to the Latin proprium, we effect a very close translation. [Reviser.] </p>
