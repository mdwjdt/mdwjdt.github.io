<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2953节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2953.</strong>“你若愿意，请听从我”表更内在的流注。这从一系列对话清楚可知。“亚伯拉罕对以弗仑说”表一种流注，如刚才所述（<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>节）。此处对话继续进行，亚伯拉罕的话，即“你若愿意，请听从我”引起以弗仑的注意，故这句话表示一种更内在的流注。内义具有这样的性质：这些表述和话语本身几乎也不是。确切地说，它们的意义从整个思路流出来，呈现为观念，事实上，在天使面前呈现为属灵的观念。外在意义或字义则充当借以能理解这些观念的对象，因为人的思想观念，尤其从圣言汲取的那些思想观念，就是天使所具有的属灵思想的对象。圣言中所描述的一切事物都具有代表性，每一句话都具有灵义。天使立刻就能意识到那些形像出自圣言，因为其中的属灵和属天之物照其次序以最有规律的方式相继而来，它们凭唯独论述主及其国度的至内在意义而具有神圣之物在里面。</p>

But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. That this signifies more interior influx, is evident from the series of the discourse. That Abraham's speaking to Ephron signified influx, was stated just above 
(n. 2951); and here the discourse is continued and the attention aroused by its being said, "but if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me;" wherefore a more interior influx is signified. The internal sense 
is of such a nature that the expressions and words are almost nothing; but their sense flowing from the series presents an idea, and indeed before the angels a spiritual idea, to which the external 
or literal sense serves as the object ex quo; for it is the ideas of man's thought which are the objects of spiritual thoughts with the angels; and in fact chiefly those ideas of thought with man that 
are from the Word, for the reason that all things in the Word are representative, and the words in both general and particular are significative; and it is at once observed that they are from the Word, 
because the spiritual and celestial things therein follow in their order in the most regular manner; and in both there is what is holy from the inmost sense, which treats solely of the Lord and His kingdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2953</b></p><p><b>2953.</b>
'Even so, please hear me' means an interior influx. This becomes clear from the dialogue that took place - 'Abraham spoke to Ephron' meaning an influx, as stated just above in <a href="2951.htm">2951</a>. Here the dialogue 
continues, Ephron's interest being aroused by Abraham's saying, 'Even so, please hear me', by which an interior influx is therefore meant. The internal sense is such that the expressions and words are 
in themselves scarcely anything at all. Rather, the meaning they carry, flowing from the train of thought, leads to ideas, and indeed with angels to spiritual ideas - which the external or literal sense 
serves as the object from which those ideas can be grasped. For it is the ideas comprising man's thought that serve as the objects which angels need for spiritual thoughts, especially those ideas 
comprising his thought which primarily are obtained from the Word. For all things described in the Word are representative, and every single expression carries a spiritual meaning. And angels are instantly 
aware that those images come from the Word, because spiritual and celestial things in the Word follow one after another in a perfectly ordered sequence, holding that which is holy within them by 
virtue of the inmost sense which has to do solely with the Lord and His kingdom. </p>

`Verumtamen si tu, placet, audias me':  quod significet influxum interiorem, constare potest a serie loquelae; quod `Abraham locutus ad Ephronem' significaverit influxum, mox supra n. 2951 dictum; hic 
continuatur loquela, et intentio excitatur, per quod dicatur `verumtamen si tu, placet, audias me,' quare influxus interio significatur.  Sensus internus talis est ut voces et verba paene nihil sint 
sed sensus eorum ex serie fluens sistat ideam, et quidem coram angeli spiritualem, cui sensus externus seu litteralis {1}inservit pro objecto ex quo; sunt enim ideae cogitationis hominis quae sunt objecta 
cogitationum spiritualium apud angelos, et quidem illae ideae cogitationi apud hominem principaliter quae sunt ex Verbo, ex causa quia ibi omnes res repraesentant, et omnes et singulae voces significant, 
et animadvertitur ilico quod e Verbo sint, {2}quia spiritualia et caelestia ibi suo ordine dispositissime consequuntur, et in illis et his sanctum ex intimo sensu, qui est {3}solum de Domino 
ac Ipsius regno. @1 i Verbi$  @2 qui I$  @3 de solo$  </p>
