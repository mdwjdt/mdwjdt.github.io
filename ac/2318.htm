<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2318节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2318.</strong>“那两个天使晚上到了所多玛”表审判之前的造访（visitation）。这从前一章那三个人，即耶和华所说的话，以及本章下文，还有“晚上”的含义清楚可知。在前一章，耶和华说“我现在要下去，察看所多玛和蛾摩拉的居民是否真的像那达到我这里的嚷叫声一样完结；若是不然，我也必知道”（20，21节），如前所示，这些话表示审判之前的造访。本章还描述了造访的行为本身，然后描述了审判，这从下文明显可知。“晚上”表造访的时间，这从下文可以看出来。至于何为造访和审判之前的造访，可参看前文（<a href="2242.htm">2242</a>节）。前一章论述了人类的败坏状态和主对那些处于邪恶，然而仍具有某种良善与真理之人的忧伤和代求。因此，本章继续论述那些具有某种良善与真理之人的得救。本章的“罗得”所代表的正是这些人。同时，本章还论述了那些完全处于邪恶与虚假之人的毁灭。“所多玛和蛾摩拉”在此所表示的正是这些人。</p>

The two angels came to Sodom in the evening. That this signifies the visitation which precedes the Judgment, can be seen from the things said by the three men, or Jehovah, in the preceding chapter; and 
also from the things that follow in this chapter; and likewise from the signification of "evening." In the preceding chapter Jehovah said: "I will go down and see whether the inhabitants of Sodom and 
Gomorrah have made a consummation according to the cry which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know" (5:20, 21), by which words, as has been there shown, is signified the visitation which precedes 
the Judgment. In this chapter there is described the act itself of visitation, and then the Judgment; as is evident from what follows. That "evening" signifies the time of visitation will be seen below. 
(What visitation is, and that visitation precedes Judgment, may be seen above, n. 2242.) The preceding chapter has treated of the perverted state of the human race, and of the Lord's grief and intercession 
for those who were in evil and yet in some good and truth; and therefore the present chapter treats, in continuance, of the salvation of those who are in some good and truth; and it is these 
who are represented in this chapter by "Lot." At the same time also the destruction of those who are altogether in evil and falsity is treated of; and it is these who are here signified by "Sodom and 
Gomorrah." </p>

'The two angels came to Sodom in the evening' means the visitation which takes place prior to judgement. This becomes clear from the statements made by the three men, that is, by Jehovah, in the previous 
chapter, also from what follows in the present chapter, as well as from the meaning of 'the evening'. In the previous chapter Jehovah said, 'I will go down and I will see whether the inhabitants 
of Sodom and Gomorrah have done altogether according to the cry which has come to Me; and if not, I will know', verses 20, 21. At that point it was shown that those words meant the visitation that takes 
place prior to judgement. In the present chapter the actual process of visitation is described and after that judgement, as is evident from what follows. That 'evening' means the time when visitation 
takes place will be seen below. As for what visitation is and the fact that visitation takes place prior to judgement, see <a href="2242.htm">2242</a>. In the previous chapter the subject was the corrupt state of the human 
race and the Lord's grief and intercession on behalf of those who are immersed in evil and yet with whom some good and truth exist. The present chapter therefore goes on to deal with the salvation 
of those with whom some good and truth exist, it being these who are represented in this chapter by Lot. At the same time it deals with the destruction of those who are immersed completely in evil and 
falsity, it being these who are meant here by Sodom and Gomorrah. </p>

`Venerunt duo angeli Sodomam in vespera': quod significet visitationem quae praecedit judicium, constare potest ab illis quae tribus viris seu Jehovah dicta sunt in capite praecedente; tum ab illis 
quae in hoc capite sequuntur; ut et a significatione `vesperae'; in capit praecedente dixit Jehovah, `Descendam et videbo, num secundum clamorem qui venit ad Me, fecerint habitatores Sodomae et Amorae 
consummationem, et si non, cognoscam,' vers. 20, 21; per quae verba quod significetur visitatio quae praecedit judicium, ibi ostensum est: in hoc capite describitur ipse visitationis actus, dein {1} 
judicium, ut a sequentibus patet.  Quod `vespera' significet tempus visitationis, videbitur infra: quid visitatio, et quod visitatio praecedat judicium, videatur n. 2242.  In capite praecedente actum 
est de statu perverso generis humani, et de dolore (c)ac intercessione Domini pro illis qui in malo, sed usque in aliquo bono et vero; quare nunc sequitur de salvatione eorum qui in aliquo bono et vero 
sunt; hi sunt qui in hoc capite repraesentantur per `Lotum'; tum simul de interitu eorum qui prorsus in malo et falso sunt; hi sunt qui hic significantur per `Sodomam et Amoram.' 	@1 i et.$ </p>
