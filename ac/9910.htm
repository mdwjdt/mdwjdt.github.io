Verses 31-35. And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. And there shall be a mouth of the head of it in the midst thereof; there shall be a lip for the mouth of it round about, the work 
of the weaver, as the mouth of a coat of mail it shall be, that it be not rent. And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, upon the skirts 
thereof round about; and bells of gold in the midst of them round about; a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about. And it shall be 
upon Aaron to minister; and the voice thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when he goeth out; that he die not. "And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod," signifies 
Divine truth in the internal form in the spiritual kingdom; "all of blue," signifies by means of influx from the good of the celestial kingdom; "and there shall be a mouth of the head of it in 
the midst thereof," signifies the method of the influx from what is above; "there shall be a lip for the mouth of it round about," signifies bounded and closed on every side; "the work of the weaver," 
signifies from the celestial; "as the mouth of a coat of mail it shall be, that it be not rent," signifies thus strong and safe from injury; "and upon the skirts of it thou shalt make," signifies in 
the extremes where is what is natural; "pomegranates," signifies memory-knowledges of good; "of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed," signifies from the good of charity and of faith; "upon 
the skirts thereof round about," signifies in the extremes where the natural is, on every side; "and bells of gold" signifies all things of doctrine and of worship from good passing over to those 
who are of the church; "in the midst of them round about," signifies from what is within the memory-knowledges of good on every side; "a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, 
upon the skirts of the robe round about," signifies thus everywhere; "and it shall be upon Aaron," signifies a representative of the Lord; "to minister," signifies when engaged in worship and in evangelization; 
"and the voice thereof shall be heard," signifies the influx of truth with those who are in the heavens and who are on earth; "when he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when 
he goeth out," signifies in every state of good and truth in worship; "that he die not," signifies that the representative does not perish, and therewith the conjunction with the heavens. </p>

Verses 31-35 And you shall make the robe of the ephod, the whole from violet. And its hole for the head<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> shall be in the middle of it; its hole<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> shall have a border round about, the work of a weaver; 
something like the hole<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of a corslet it must have, so that it does not tear. And you shall make on its hem pomegranates of violet, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet on its hem round about, and bells 
of gold in the middle of them round about - a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe round about. And it shall be on Aaron when he ministers, and 
his voice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> will be heard when he goes into the holy place before Jehovah, and when he comes out, that he may not die.  </p>
<p>'And you shall make the robe' means Divine Truth in its inward form in the spiritual 
kingdom. 'The whole from violet' means through an inflow from the good of the celestial kingdom. 'And its hole for the head shall be in the middle of it' means the course which the inflow from 
the higher source takes. 'And its hole shall have a border round about' means that it is bounded and enclosed on every side. 'The work of a weaver' means from the celestial. 'And the hole of a corslet 
it must have, so that it does not tear' means so that it has been made strong and safe from damage. 'And you shall make on its hem' means in the most external parts, where the natural is. 'Pomegranates' 
means factual knowledge of good. 'Of violet, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet' means springing from the good of charity and faith. 'On its hem round about' means in the most external parts, where 
the natural is, in every direction. 'And bells of gold' means all aspects of religious teachings and of worship springing from good which come across to those who belong to the Church. 'In the middle 
of them round about' means consisting of the more internal features of the factual knowledge of good in every direction. 'A bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, on the 
hem of the robe round about' means that this shall be so everywhere, at every point. 'And it shall be on Aaron' means that which is representative of the Lord. 'When he ministers' means while engaged 
in worship and preaching the gospel. 'And his voice will be heard' means the inflow of truth among those in heaven and those on earth. 'When he goes into the holy place before Jehovah, and when he comes 
out' means in every state of good and truth in worship. 'That he may not die' means so that what is representative, and the joining to heaven through it, may not be lost.
