<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4816节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4816.</strong>“转身去了一个亚杜兰人那里”表转向虚假。这从“转身”和“人”的含义清楚可知：“转身”是指离开去行悖逆的事，因为“转身”和“下去”一样，论及远离良善，转向邪恶，远离真理，转向虚假；“人”是指拥有聪明的人，抽象意义上是指真理，因为真正的聪明从真理形成（<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>，<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>，<a href="3309.htm">3309</a>节），但在反面意义上是指没有聪明的人，因而是指虚假。这种虚假就由“亚杜兰人”来代表，因为亚杜兰在犹大地业的边界（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.35.htm">15:35</a>），因而表示出自良善的真理；如在弥迦书：<br />玛利沙的居民哪，我必使那夺取你的来到你这里；以色列的荣耀必到亚杜兰。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥1.15.htm">1:15</a>）<br />不过，在圣言中，绝大多数事物都有一个反面意义，亚杜兰也不例外；它在反面意义上表示出自邪恶的虚假。绝大多数事物之所以都有一个反面意义，是因为在迦南地成为雅各儿子们的地业之前，它被表示虚假与邪恶的民族占据；后来当雅各的儿子陷入相反的境地时，也是如此；因为地照着居于其上居民的性质具有和这些居民一样的代表。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4816</b></p><p><b>4816.</b>
And turned aside to a man, an Adullamite. That this signifies to falsity, is evident from the signification of "turning aside," as being to go away into what is perverse, for "turning aside," like "going 
down," is predicated of far removal from good to evil, and from truth to falsity; and from the signification of a "man" [vir] as being one who is intelligent, and in the abstract sense truth, because 
the genuine intellectual is from truths (n. 265, 749, 1007, 3134, 3309); but in the opposite sense it is one who is not intelligent, and consequently falsity. This falsity is represented by an Adullamite, 
for Adullam was on the boundary of the inheritance of Judah (Josh. 15:35), and hence signified the truth which is from good; as also in Micah: </p>
<p>     Yet will I bring an heir to thee O inhabitress 
of Mareshah, even to Adullam shall come the glory of Israel (Micah 1:15); </p>
<p>but as most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so too has Adullam, and it then signifies the falsity which 
is from evil. That most things have also an opposite sense is because before the land of Canaan was made an inheritance for the sons of Jacob, it was possessed by nations by whom were signified falsities 
and evils; and also afterwards when the sons of Jacob went into what is contrary; for lands take on the representation of the nations and peoples who inhabit them, according to their quality. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4816</b></p><p><b>4816.</b>
'And turned aside [even] to a man, an Adullamite' means a turning to falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'turning aside' as a departure into perversity, for turning aside, like going down, is 
used to refer to a retreat from good to evil, and from truth to falsity; from the meaning of 'a man' as one who has intelligence, and in the abstract sense as truth since a genuine understanding is formed 
from truths, dealt with in <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>, <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, <a href="3309.htm">3309</a>, but in the contrary sense as one who has no intelligence, and therefore as falsity. This falsity is represented by 'an Adullamite', for Adullam 
was on the border of the inheritance of Judah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2015:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 15:35</a>, and consequently meant truth coming from good, as also in Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will again bring an heir to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah; even to 
Adullam the glory of Israel will come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%201:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 1:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But because most things in the Word also have a contrary sense, so also does Adullam, in which case it means falsity coming from evil. The reason 
most things also have a contrary sense is that before the land of Canaan became an inheritance for the sons of Jacob it was occupied by nations who meant falsities and evils, as it also was subsequently 
when the sons of Jacob entered into what was contrary. For territories take on the same representations as those of the nations or peoples inhabiting them, in accordance with the essential nature of these. </p>

</p><b>4816.</b>
`Et declinavit ad virum Adullamitam': quod significet ad falsum, constat a significatione `declinare' quod sit in perversum abire; declinare enim, sicut descendere, praedicatur de elongatione a bono 
ad malum et a vero ad falsum; a significatione `viri' quod sit intelligens, et in sensu abstracto verum, quia genuinum intellectuale est ex veris, de qua n. 265, 749, 1007, 3134, 3309, at in opposito 
sensu non intelligens, proinde falsum; hoc falsum repraesentatur per `Adullamitam', Adullam enim erat in termino hereditatis Jehudae, Jos. xv 35, et inde significabat verum quod a bono, ut quoque 
apud Micham,           Adhuc heredem tibi adducam, habitatrix Mareshah, usque ad      Adullam veniet gloria Israelis, i 15; </p>
<p>sed quia pleraque in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum habent, ita etiam Adullam, 
et significat falsum quod a malo; quod pleraque etiam oppositum sensum habeant, est quia antequam terra Canaan facta est hereditas filiis Jacobi, possessa est a gentibus per quas significabantur 
falsa et mala; et quoque postea quando filii Jacobi in contrarium iverunt; terrae enim induunt repraesentationem gentium et populorum qui ibi sunt, secundum quale eorum. </p>
