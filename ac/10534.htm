<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10534</strong>.出埃及记33:4-6.百姓听见这凶信就悲哀，也没有人佩戴妆饰。耶和华对摩西说，你对以色列人说，你们是硬着颈项的百姓，我若一霎时上到你们中间，必灭绝你们。现在你们要把妆饰从身上摘下来，使我可以知道对你们做什么。以色列人在何烈山上把身上的妆饰剥下来。<br />“百姓听见这凶信就悲哀”表他们悲伤是因为，他们没有占据超越他人的地位。“也没有人佩戴妆饰”表他们的外在的性质，即它缺乏神性之物。“耶和华对摩西说”表指示。“你对以色列人说，你们是硬着颈项的百姓”表这个民族不会接受来自神性的流注。“我若一霎时上到你们中间，必灭绝你们”表如果神性之物真的流入并与他们同住，他们就会被毁灭。“现在你们要把妆饰从身上摘下来”表他们的外在的性质，即它缺乏神性之物。“使我可以知道对你们做什么”表以这种方式某种事物是有可能建立在他们当中的。“以色列人把身上的妆饰剥下来”表他们被剥夺外在事物中的神性。“在何烈山上”表在敬拜、教会和圣言的外在事物里面。</p>

Verses 4-6. And the people heard this evil word, and they mourned; and they put not any man his ornament upon him. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people; 
I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and will consume thee; therefore now bring down thine ornament from upon thee, and I shall know what I will do to thee. And the sons of Israel stripped 
themselves of their ornament by Mount Horeb. "And the people heard this evil word, and they mourned," signifies their grief at not being pre-eminent to others; "and they put not any man his ornament 
upon him," signifies the quality of their external, that it was devoid of what is Divine; "and Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Say unto the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked 
people," signifies that that nation would not receive influx from the Divine; "I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and will consume thee," signifies that they would perish if what is 
Divine were to flow in with them; "therefore now bring down thine ornament from upon thee," signifies the quality of their external, that it was devoid of what is Divine; "and I shall know what I will 
do to thee," signifies that in this way something may come forth with them; "and the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornament," signifies the deprivation of Divine truth in the external things 
with them; "by Mount Horeb," signifies in the external things of worship, of the church, and of the Word. </p>

<p>'And 
the people heard this bad news, and mourned' means their grief because they do not occupy a position above others. 'And no one put on his finery' means the nature of their external which is such that 
it lacks what is Divine. 'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instruction. 'Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people' means that that nation would receive no influx from the Divine. 
'Were I for one moment to go up in your midst I would consume you' means that they would be destroyed if what is Divine were to flow in and reside with them. 'And now, take off your finery' means the 
nature of their external which is such that it is without anything Divine. 'And I shall know what I am to do to you' means that, this being so, it is possible for something to be established among them. 
'And the children of Israel tore away their finery' means that they were deprived of Divine Truth in external things. 'At Mount Horeb' means within the external things of worship, the Church, and 
the Word.

Vers. 4-6.  Et audivit populus verbum malum hoc, et luxerunt, et non posuerunt aliquis ornatum suum super se.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Dic ad filios Israelis, Vos populus durus cervice, momento 
uno ascendero in medio tui, et consumpsero te; et nunc descendere fac ornatum tuum desuper te, et cognoscam quid faciam tibi.  Et abripuerunt filii Israelis ornatum suum, a monte Choreb.  `Et audivit 
populus verbum malum hoc, et luxerunt' significat dolorem eorum ob non eminentiam super alios:  `et non posuerunt aliquis ornatum suum super se' significat quale externi eorum quod absque Divino:  `et 
dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem:  `dic ad filios Israelis, Vos populus durus cervice' significat quod gens illa non receptura sit influxum a Divino:  `momento uno (x)ascendero in 
medio tui, et consumpsero te' significat quod perituri si Divinum influeret apud illos:  `et nunc descendere fac ornatum tuum desuper te' significat quale externi illorum quod absque Divino:  `et cognoscam 
quid faciam tibi' significat quod sic aliquid apud illos existere possit:  `et abripuerunt filii Israelis ornatum suum' significat deprivationem Divini Veri in externis apud illos:  `a monte Choreb' 
significat in externis cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi. </p>
