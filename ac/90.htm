<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第90节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>90.</strong>创世记2:5-6 田间还没有灌木，田间的草本还没有长起来，因为耶和华神还没有降雨在地上，也没有人耕土。但有雾气从地上腾，滋润整个土面。<br />笼统而言，“田间的灌木”和“田间的草本”象征人的外在所产生的。当人尚是属灵者时，其外在被称为“地”（earth），等他成了属天者，其外在就被称为“土”（ground）和“田”（field）。“雨”（随后又称为“雾气”），象征冲突止息后的宁静。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]90.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_90/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_5-6" target=_top>Genesis 2:5-6</a>. And no shrub of the field was yet on the earth, and no plant of the field was yet sprouting, because Jehovah God had not made it rain on the earth; and there was no human to cultivate the ground. And he made a mist rise up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.<br />The shrub of the field and the plant of the field in general mean everything that the person's outer self produces. The earth is the outer self that the person had when spiritual. The ground — and the field — is the outer self when the person becomes heavenly. The rain, soon afterward called mist, is the peaceful calm that follows the end of battle. </p>

Verses 5, 6. And there was no shrub of the field as yet in the earth, and there was no herb of the field as yet growing, because Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth; and there was no 
man to till the ground. And He made a mist to ascend from the earth, and watered all the faces of the ground. By the "shrub of the field" and the "herb of the field" are meant in general all that his 
external man produces. The external man is called "earth" while he remains spiritual, but "ground" and also "field" when he becomes celestial. "Rain" which is soon after called "mist" is the tranquility 
of peace when combat ceases. </p>

And He caused a mist to go up from the earth, and it watered all the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground.   'Shrub of the field' and 'plant of the field' are used to mean in general everything which his external 
man brings forth. 'Earth' is the external man while he was spiritual; 'ground', and 'field' as well, is his external man when he is becoming celestial. 'The rain', which is next called 'a mist', is 
the serenity of peace when conflict comes to an end.

Vers. 5, 6.  Et nullum virgultum agri adhuc erat in terra, et nulla herba agri adhuc germinabat, quia non pluere fecit Jehovah Deus super terra, et homo nullus ad colendum humum. Et vaporem ascendere 
fecit e terra, et irrigavit omnes facies humi. Per 'virgultum agri' et 'herbam agri' intelligitur in genere omne quod producit externus ejus homo: 'terra' est externus homo dum fuit spiritualis; 'humus,' 
ut et 'ager,' est externus homo dum fit caelestis; 'pluvia,' quae mox dicitur 'vapor,' est tranquillitas pacis, cessante pugna.
