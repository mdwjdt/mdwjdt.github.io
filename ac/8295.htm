<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8295节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8295.</strong>“我的手要赶出他们”表凭它的能力，天堂要被摧毁。这从“赶出”和“手”的含义清楚可知：“赶出”是指逐出，因而是指摧毁；“手”是指能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="6292.htm">6292</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>节）。之所以表示天堂，是因为经上说“要赶出他们”，也就是把他们从天堂赶出去；因为当恶人所受的约束放松时，他们就会变得如此大胆、傲慢，以至于以为自己能摧毁天堂本身。事实上，凡在地狱里的人都与天堂对立，因为他们与良善和真理对立，因而不断有摧毁它的欲望，并且只要允许，就会试图如此行（<a href="8273.htm">8273</a>e节）。<br />摧毁天堂或将天堂里的人逐出的愿望不是像世上那样通过敌对入侵实现的，因为这种入侵或这种争战在来世是不可能的。相反，它是通过摧毁属于信的真理和属于爱的良善实现的，因为信之真理和爱之良善就是天堂。来世的冲突和战争就在于此，这些冲突和争战是何等地惨烈和可怕，蒙主的神性怜悯，等到谈论地狱时再予以阐述。不要以其它任何方式来理解启示录中所描述的争战：<br />在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战。龙也同它的使者去争战，但并没有得胜。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.7.htm">12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.8.htm">8</a>）</p>

My hand shall drive them out. That this signifies that by virtue of power, heaven shall be destroyed, is evident from the signification of "driving out," as being to cast down, and thus to destroy; and 
from the signification of "hand," as being power (see n. 878, 4931-4937, 6292, 6947, 7188, 7189, 7518). That heaven is signified, is because it is said that "he will drive them out," thus from heaven; 
for when the reins are loosened, the evil are of such audacity and impudence as to suppose themselves able to destroy heaven itself. For all who are in the hells are in opposition against heaven, 
because against good and truth, and consequently are in the continual cupidity of destroying it, and insofar as this is permitted them, they continually endeavor to do it (n. 8273). [2] The will to destroy 
heaven, or the will to cast down those who are there, is not accomplished by hostile invasion, as on earth, for such invasion or such combat is not possible in the other life; but it is accomplished 
through the destruction of the truth which is of faith, and of the good which is of love, for the truth of faith and the good of love are heaven. Herein consist combats and wars in the other life, 
and how direful and frightful these combats and wars are, will be told at the end of the chapters, where of the Lord's Divine mercy I will speak about the hells. The war described by John: "there was 
war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels, but prevailed not" (Rev. 12:7, 8), is to be understood in no other way. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8295</b></p><p><b>8295.</b>
'My hand will drive them out' means that by its power heaven will be destroyed. This is clear from the meaning of 'driving out' as dislodging and so destroying; and from the meaning of 'hand' as power, 
dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="6292.htm">6292</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>. Heaven is meant because of the words 'will drive them out', that is, from heaven; for when the restraint placed on the evil is loosened they 
become so bold and arrogant as to think that they have the power to destroy heaven itself. For all who are in the hells are opposed to heaven because they are opposed to goodness and truth and consequently 
have a constant desire to destroy it, and so far as they are allowed, try to do so, <a href="8273.htm">8273</a>(end). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Seeking to destroy heaven or to dislodge those who are there is not accomplished by a hostile 
incursion as on earth, for no incursion or conflict such as that takes place in the next life. Instead it is accomplished by the destruction of truth which belongs to faith and of good which belongs 
to love; for the truth of faith and the good of love constitute heaven. These are the things in which conflicts and wars in the next life consist. How terrible and horrid they are will in the Lord's 
Divine mercy be told at the ends of the chapters where the hells will be the subject.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> The war described in John should not be understood in any other kind of way, </p>
<blockquote>
War took place in heaven. Michael 
and his angels fought against the dragon, while the dragon fought and his angels, but they did not prevail. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:7, 8</a>.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> This proposal was not fulfilled, but presumably the material mentioned 
here concerning the hells appeared in the work published a few years later, in <a href="1758.htm">1758</a>, whose English title is Heaven and Hell. </p>

`Expellet illos manus mea': quod significet quod ex potentia destruetur caelum, constat ex significatione `expellere' quod sit dejicere et sic destruere; et ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, 
de qua n. 878, 4931-4937, 6292, (x)6947, 7188, 7189, 7518; quod {1}significetur caelum, est quia dicitur quod expellet illos, ita a caelo, nam {2}mali, cum illis (t)frenum laxatur, eo audaciae et 
impudentiae {2}sunt ut {3}putent (d)se posse ipsum caelum destruere; sunt enim omnes qui in infernis in opposito contra caelum, quia contra bonum et verum, et inde in continua cupiditate destruendi illud, 
et quantum illis {4}permittitur, tantum id conantur, n. 8273 fin. 	2 Velle destruere caelum seu velle (x)dejicere illos qui ibi, non fit per invasionem hostilem sicut in terra, nam talis invasio 
seu talis pugna non datur in altera vita, sed id fit per destructionem veri quod fidei et boni quod amoris, nam verum fidei et bonum amoris sunt caelum; in his consistunt pugnae et bella in altera vita, 
quae quam dira et atrocia sint, ad finem capitum ubi de infernis, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur; {5} `bellum' de quo apud Johannem, Factum est bellum in caelo, Michael et angeli ejus pugnarunt 
contra draconem, draco autem pugnavit et angeli ejus, sed non praevaluerunt, Apoc. xii 7, 8, non aliter intelligendum est. 	@1 intelligatur$ 	@2 A wavers between malis...sunt and mali...vadunt.
