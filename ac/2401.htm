<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2401节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2401.</strong>“说，你们起来离开这地方”表他们不能继续留在邪恶的状态。这从“起来”、“离开”，以及“地方”的含义清楚可知。“起来”经常出现在圣言中，但人们很少想到它还有别的意思，因为这是一种常见说法。然而，就内义而言，这个词含有从恶上升到善的意思，如此处的情形；因为心智从恶中退出后，就会被提升（<a href="2388.htm">2388</a>节）。“离开”就是退出，或不待下去。“地方”是指邪恶的状态（<a href="2393.htm">2393</a>节）。故此处的含义是显而易见的。<br />前面反复阐明了那些拥有对真理的认知，同时又过着邪恶生活之人的品性，即他们只要过着邪恶的生活，就什么也不信；因为意愿邪恶，并通过意愿行恶，同时又在信仰上承认真理是不可能的。这也表明，若除了邪恶外，人不意愿别的事，他的意愿由此也不做别的事，那么他无法凭着思想与言说真理，甚至思想与言说良善而得救。死后活着的，是人的意愿本身，而不是他的思维，除非这思维是从他的意愿流入的。<br />人死后的品性取决于他的意愿，人能看出他对曾经吸收、甚至所教导的信之真理持有什么样的观点，因为这些真理会对他作出宣判。那时，他极不情愿通过它们思考，以至于完全逃避它们。事实上，只要允许，他就会象那帮魔鬼一样咒骂它们。人们若没有接受有关死后生命的教导，可能会以为当他们发现主掌管整个宇宙，并听说天堂就在于爱主爱邻时，接受信仰对他们来说是很容易的事。而事实却是，恶人距离能接受信仰，即通过意愿去相信，如同地狱距离天堂那样遥远，因为他们完全沉浸在邪恶和由此衍生的虚假中。他们一靠近，或一到场，人就能知道并发觉他们反对主，反对邻舍，因而反对良善，随之反对真理。有一种可怕的气场从其意愿和衍生思维的生命中散发出来（<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>节）。<br />如果人们仅凭在来世接受教导就相信并成为良善，那么没人会留在地狱，因为主渴望将所有人，无论有多少，都提入天堂，归到祂自己那里。祂的怜悯是无限的，因为它是神性怜悯本身，事实上是针对全人类的，因而既针对善人，也针对恶人。</p>

And said, Up, get you out of this place. That this signifies that they should not remain in a state of evil, is evident from the signification of "rising up," and of "getting out," and also of the "place." 
To "rise up" often occurs in the Word, but excites little thought as to what it further signifies, because it is a familiar expression. But in the internal sense this expression involves elevation, 
as here, from evil to good; for the mind is elevated when it recedes from evil (n. 2388). To "get out" is to recede, or not to remain. And the "place" is a state of evil (n. 2393). Thus the signification 
is evident. [2] The quality of those who are in the knowledges of truth, but at the same time in a life of evil, has been repeatedly stated before, namely, that so long as they are in a life 
of evil they believe nothing; for to will evil and from will to do evil, and at the same time to acknowledge truth in faith, is not possible. This shows also that a man cannot be saved by thinking and 
speaking what is true, nor even what is good, while he wills nothing else, and from this his will does nothing else, than evil. It is the very will of man that lives after death; not so his thought, 
except that which flows from his will. [3] As therefore a man is such as his will is, it is evident what must be his opinion of the truths of faith he has learned, and even taught, seeing that they 
condemn him. So far is he then from making them the basis of his thoughts, that he feels a positive aversion for them; nay, insofar as he is permitted to do so, he, like the devil's crew, blasphemes them. 
They who have not been instructed concerning the life after death may suppose that it will be easy for them to receive faith when they see that the Lord governs the universe, and when they hear that 
heaven consists in loving the Lord and the neighbor; whereas the truth is that the evil are as far from being able to receive faith, that is, to believe from the will, as hell is from heaven, for 
they are wholly in evil, and in the falsity thence derived. That such persons are against the Lord and against the neighbor, and therefore against good, and consequently against truth, is known and perceived 
from their mere approach, or presence. There is a horrible sphere that exhales from the life of their will and of their derivative thought (n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504). [4] If by mere instruction 
in the other life it were possible that men could be brought to believe and to become good, there would not be a single person in hell; for the Lord desires to raise all without exception to Himself 
into heaven. For His mercy is infinite, because it is the Divine mercy itself, that is extended toward the whole human race, and therefore toward the evil as well as toward the good. </p>

'And said, Rise up, go out of this place' means that they were not to remain in a state of evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'rising up' and 'going out', and also of 'place'. 'Rising up' occurs 
often in the Word, being one of the common expressions found there, but little thought is given to what else it may mean. In the internal sense however it entails, as it does here, being raised up from 
evil to good, for the mind is raised up when it draws back from evil, <a href="2388.htm">2388</a>. 'Going out' means drawing back or not remaining, while 'place' means a state of evil, <a href="2393.htm">2393</a>. From this it is evident what 
the meaning is here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The character of people who possess cognitions of truth but at the same time lead a life of evil has been stated frequently already- that as long as they lead a life of evil 
they believe nothing; for to will evil and consequently to do it, and at the same time in faith to acknowledge truth, is not possible. From this it is also evident that a person cannot be saved by thinking 
and speaking what is true, nor even what is good, if he wills nothing but evil, and as a consequence of what he wills does nothing but evil. Man's will itself is what lives on after death, and 
not so much his thinking apart from that which flows from his will. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since therefore a person's character after death is determined by what he wills, one can see what he is able to think about 
the truths of faith he has absorbed, indeed taught, seeing that these condemn him. He is in this case so disinclined to think from them that he avoids them altogether. Indeed insofar as he is allowed, 
he curses them, as the devil's crew do. People who have not been taught about the life after death may imagine that they will find it easy at that time to receive faith when they see that the Lord governs 
the whole of heaven, and when they hear that heaven is loving Him and the neighbour. But evil people are as far removed from being able to receive faith, that is, from having the will to believe, 
as hell is from heaven. They are in fact totally immersed in evil and in falsity derived from this. From their mere arrival itself or presence it is recognized and perceived that they are against the 
Lord and against the neighbour and so against what is good and consequently against what is true. There is an unmentionable sphere which emanates from the life of their will and so of their thinking, <a href="1048.htm">1048</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="1504.htm">1504</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 If it were possible for people to believe and become good merely by receiving instruction in the next life no one would be left in hell; for no matter how many, the Lord 
desires to raise them all up to heaven towards Himself. For His mercy is infinite since it is Divine mercy itself and is indeed directed towards the whole human race, and so towards the evil as well 
as the good. </p>

Quod `dixit, Surgite, exite e loco isto' significet quod non manerent in statu mali, constat a significatione `surgere' et `exire tum `loci'; surgere in Verbo saepe legitur, sed parum cogitatur quid 
ulterius significat, quia inter familiares voces est, sed in sensu interno involvit elevationem, ut hic a malo ad bonum, mens enim elevat cum {1} recedit a malo, n. 2388: `exire' est recedere, seu non 
manere: `locus' autem est status mali, n. 2393; inde patet quod illa significentur.  [2] Quales ii sunt qui in cognitionibus veri, sed simul in vitam ab, aliquod prius dictum est, nempe quamdiu in vita 
mali, quod nihil credat nam velle malum et inde facere malum, ac fide agnoscere verum nusquam datur; inde quoque patet quod non salvari queat homo per cogitare et loqui verum, immo bonum, cum non 
aliud vult, et ex suo velle non aliud facit quam malum; ipsum velle hominis est quod vivit post mortem, non ita ejus cogitare aliud quam quod fluit ex ejus velle; [3] cum itaque talis est qualis {2} ejus 
velle, constare potest, quid cogitare possit de veris fidei quae hausit, immo quae docuit, quia illa damnarent eum; tantum abest ut tunc ex illis cogitet, ut aversetur illa, immo, quantum permittitur, 
sicut diaboli turba, blasphemet.  Putare possunt qui non instructi de vita post mortem, quod fac possint tunc recipere fidem cum vident quod Dominus regat universum caelum, et cum audiunt quod caelum 
sit amare Ipsum et proximum; sed tantum abest ut mali possint recipere fidem {3} hoc est, ex velle credere, quantum infernum abest a caelo; sunt enim prorsus in malo et inde in falso; ex falso solo 
adventu eorum, seu praesentia, cognoscitur et percipitur quod contra Dominum sint, ac contra proximum, ita contra bonum et inde contra verum; est sphaera nefanda quae ex vita eorum voluntatis, et inde 
cogitationis exhalat, n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504.  [4] Si hoc potuisset fieri, quod crederent et boni fierent, ex sola instructione in illa vita, ne unus esset in inferno, nam Dominus, quotcumque sunt, 
ad Se in caelum vult elevare.  Ipsius enim misericordia est infinita quia est ipsa Divina, et quidem erga universum genus humanum, ita erga tam malos quam bonos. 	@1 quando.$ 	@2 i post mortem.$ 	@3 hanc.$ </p>
