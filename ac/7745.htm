<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7745节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7745.</strong>在我与这个灵人交谈期间，一些灵人前往我的脑袋前部，就是那个灵人所在的地方，并挤压他。于是，他退到一边，把这个地方让给他们。这些新来的灵人便彼此交谈，但无论我周围的灵人，还是我自己，都不明白他们在说什么。天使指教我，他们是来自火星的灵人，知道如何以一种让在场的其他灵人既听不懂也察觉不出他们在说什么的方式彼此交谈。我很惊讶这种说话方式能够存在，因为所有灵人都使用一种说话方式。我之所以惊讶，是因为一切言语都从思维流出，而思维由观念构成，在灵界，这些观念取代了话语。在来世，这些观念话语和它们背后的思维本身，在思维变成说话思维之前，一起被清楚感知到。我被告知，这些灵人以一种特殊的方式通过唇和脸来形成别人无法理解的观念；就在他们利用这种方式彼此交谈的那一刻，他们巧妙地把自己的思维瞒过其他人；并且小心翼翼，不让其情感有丝毫的流露；他们如此行的原因在于，但凡其情感被人有所察觉，思维就会变得显而易见，因为思维是从情感流出的。我进一步得知，那些以为天上的生活唯独在于知识，而非爱的生活之人便巧妙策划这种说话方式，然而并非他们所有人都是这样；他们成为灵人后就把这种说话方式保留下来。他们就是石鸟所专门表示的人；因为当他们的情感抽离出来，他们的思维避开其他人时，通过面部表情的调节和唇部动作产生言语，就是剥夺了他们言语的生命，使它变得如同一尊雕像，并逐渐使自己也变成一尊毫无生命的雕像。</p>

During my conversation with this spirit, some spirits betook themselves toward the front part of the head, where he was, and pressed upon him; whereupon he retired to one side and gave them place. The 
stranger spirits talked among themselves, but neither the spirits about me, nor I, understood what they said. I was instructed by angels that they were spirits from the earth Mars, who know how to talk 
together in such a way that the spirits present would neither understand nor perceive what they said. I wondered that such speech is possible, seeing that all spirits have one speech; and all speech 
flows from thought, and this consists of ideas, which in the spiritual world are in the place of words; and the ideas which are words, together with the thought itself before it becomes speaking thought, 
are plainly perceived in the other life. I was told that by a certain method by means of the lips and the face these spirits form ideas not intelligible to others, and that at the moment when they 
are speaking with one another by this means, they artfully withdraw their thoughts from others; taking especial care that nothing of affection shall manifest itself; for if anything of affection is 
perceived, the thought would then be open, because the thought flows from the affection. I was further instructed that those inhabitants of the earth Mars who make celestial life to consist in knowledges 
alone, and not in the life of love, have contrived such speech; yet not all of them; and that when these become spirits they retain it. These are they who were especially signified by the bird of 
stone; for to form speech by modifications of the countenance and foldings of the lips together with a removal of the affections and a withdrawal of the thoughts from others, is to deprive speech of 
its soul, and to make it like an image, and gradually also to make themselves so.  </p>

While I was talking to this spirit some other spirits brought themselves to the front of my head, where that spirit was, and pressed in on him. He therefore moved to one side and let them take his place. 
The newly-arrived spirits were talking to one another, but neither the spirits around me nor I myself could understand what they were saying. Angels informed me that they were spirits from the planet 
Mars, who knew how to talk to one another in such a way that the other spirits present would not understand or perceive anything of what they were saying. I was amazed that such a way of speaking 
could exist, since all spirits use a single way of speaking. I was amazed because all speech flows from thought, which is composed of individual ideas. and these ideas take the place of words in the 
spiritual world. Such idea-words, together with the thought behind them before it is expressed, are perceived plainly in the next life. I was told that those spirits know a certain way of moving their 
lips and face to form ideas that are unintelligible to others, and that at the moment they are using this way of speaking to one another they are artfully withholding their thoughts from others. They 
take particular care not to allow any of their affection to reveal itself, the reason why they do so being that if any of their affection is recognized their thought is evident since thought flows from 
affection. I was further informed that the inhabitants of Mars who suppose that heavenly life lies solely in knowledge and not in a life of love have devised this way of speaking, yet not all; and 
that they retain this when they become spirits. These are the ones who were meant specifically by the bird of stone; for to produce speech by means of facial expressions and movements of the lips when 
their affections are isolated and their thoughts withheld from others is to deprive their speech of life and make it like a statue. And by degrees they also make themselves like lifeless statues. </p>

</p><b>7745.</b>
Cum in collocutione cum hoc spiritu eram, inferebant se quidam spiritus versus anteriorem partem capitis, ubi ille, quem premebant; quare ille ad unum latus secessit, et illis locum dedit.  Spiritus 
advenae inter se loquebantur, sed nec spiritus circum me intelligebant, nec ego, quid loquebantur.  Instruebar ab angelis quod essent spiritus ex tellure Martis, qui (x)callebant ita inter se loqui ut 
praesentes spiritus non aliquid intelligerent nec perciperent quid {1}loquerentur; mirabar quod talis loquela dari posset, quoniam una loquela est omnibus spiritibus, et quoniam omnis loquela fluit 
ex cogitatione, {2}et haec consistit ex ideis, {3}quae pro vocibus sunt in spirituali mundo, et quod ideae quae voces, una cum ipsa cogitatione antequam fit loquens, percipiantur manifeste in altera vita; 
dicebatur mihi quod spiritus illi forment certo modo ideas aliis non intelligibiles per labia et faciem, et quod eo momento cum per illa inter se loquuntur, subtrahant arte cogitationes suas ab aliis, 
cavendo imprimis ne aliquid affectionis se manifestet; ex causa, si aliquid affectionis percipitur, quod tunc cogitatio pateret, cogitatio enim fluit ex affectione.  Instruebar porro quod incolae 
telluris Martis, qui vitam caelestem in solis cognitionibus et non in vita amoris ponunt, talem loquelam effinxerint, non tamen omnes, et quod illi cum fiunt spiritus hoc retineant.  {4}Hi sunt qui 
in specie per avem lapideam significati {5}sunt; nam per formationes vultus et volutiones labiorum, cum remotione affectionum et subtractione cogitationum ab aliis, sistere loquelam, est loquelam exanimare, 
et illam facere instar simulacri, et per gradus se quoque similes. 	@1 loquebantur I$ 	@2 quae$ 	@3 et ideae cogitationis omnes perceptibiles sunt$ 	@4 Et quod ii sint$ 	@5 sint$ </p>
