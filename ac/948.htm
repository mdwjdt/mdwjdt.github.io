<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第948节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>948.</strong>左边还有另外一种大酒桶（如那里的人所看到的样子）。住在其中的那些精灵在世时以为，当他们行恶时，他们是在行善，反之亦然。他们就这样将善置于恶中。他们会在那个地方停留一段时日，在此期间，他们被剥夺理性。失去理性时，他们好似沉睡，这时无论他们做什么，都不会归咎于他们。然而，在他们自己看来，他们似乎是醒着的。一旦恢复理性，他们就再次成为自己，如其他精灵那样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]948.</strong> There is another vat off to the left too, as it seems to them, and in it are some who during physical life thought they had done well when they had done wrong and vice versa. So they put evil in place of goodness. They stay there for a time, and all the while they are being deprived of their rationality. Once stripped of reason, they go into a kind of sleep, and they are not held responsible for anything they then do. They still seem to themselves to be awake, however.<br />When rationality returns to them, they regain consciousness and are like other spirits. </p>

There is at the left another tun-as it appears to them-in which are some who in the life of the body had supposed that when they did evil they did good, and the converse; so that they had made good to 
consist in evil. These remain there for a while, and then are deprived of rationality, on the loss of which they are as if asleep, and what they then do is not imputed to them; but yet they seem to 
themselves to be awake. On their rationality being restored to them they return to themselves and are as other spirits. </p>

There is also another tun on the left, as it seems to those who are there. In it there are certain spirits who during their lifetime had imagined that when they did evil they were doing good, and vice 
versa. Thus they had made good consist in evil. They stay in that place for some time, during which they are deprived of rationality. Having been deprived in this way they are like people asleep, and 
whatever they do at that time they are not held responsible for it. To themselves however they seem to be awake. When their rationality has been restored to them they become themselves once again and 
are as other spirits.  </p>

</p><b>948.</b>
Est quoque ad sinistrum alia tonna, sic iis apparet, in qua sunt quidam qui in vita corporis putarunt, cum malum fecerunt, fecisse bonum, et vicissim, ita quod in malo posuerint bonum; ii ibi morantur 
ad tempus, ac tunc rationalitate orbantur, qua cum orbati, sunt quasi in somno, et quicquid tunc faciunt, iis non imputatur; sed usque videntur sibi vigiles: reddita iis rationalitate ad se redeunt 
et sunt sicut alii spiritus. </p>
