<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5749节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5749.</strong>“你们这样行是作恶了”表声称那真理是自己的，是违反神性律法的。这从“贼”的含义清楚可知，此处他们“这样行是作恶”所暗指的“贼”是指声称属于主的东西，即“约瑟”的银杯所表示的真理（参看<a href="5747.htm">5747</a>节），是自己的。显然，如此声称是违反神性律法的（<a href="2609.htm">2609</a>节）。人之所以不可声称来自主的任何东西，因而不可声称真理与良善是自己的，是为了叫他能处于真理的气场；他处于真理的气场到何等程度，就处于天上的天使所在之光到何等程度；他处于那光到何等程度，就处于聪明和智慧到何等程度；他处于聪明和智慧到何等程度，就处于幸福到何等程度。因此，人应当出于内心的信仰承认，真理与良善丝毫不源于他自己；相反，他所领受的一切真理与真理皆来自主；他应当承认这一点，因为事实就是如此。</p>

Ye have done evil in so doing. That this signifies that it is contrary to Divine law to claim it to themselves, is evident from the signification of "theft," which is meant here by the "evil which they 
did," as being to claim to oneself that which belongs to the Lord, namely, the truth which is signified by Joseph's silver cup (see n. 5747). That this is contrary to the Divine law is manifest (n. 
2609). The reason why man ought not to claim to himself anything that is from the Lord, thus not truth and good, is that he may be in the truth; and insofar as he is in the truth, so far he is in the 
light in which angels are in heaven; and insofar as he is in this light, so far he is in intelligence and wisdom; and insofar as he is in intelligence and wisdom, so far he is in happiness. This is the 
reason why man ought to acknowledge from the faith of the heart that nothing of truth and good is from himself, but all from the Lord, and this because it is so. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5749</b></p><p><b>5749.</b>
'You have done evil in what you have done' means that it is contrary to Divine law to claim that truth as their own. This is clear from the meaning of a theft, implied here by 'the evil which they had 
done', as claiming as one's own what is the Lord's, namely the truth meant by 'Joseph's cup made of silver', dealt with in <a href="5747.htm">5747</a>. The fact that making such a claim is contrary to Divine law is self-evident; 
see <a href="2609.htm">2609</a>. A person ought not to claim as his own anything that comes from the Lord, thus not anything that is true or good, so that he may dwell in the sphere of truth; and to the extent that 
he dwells in the sphere of truth he dwells in the light that the angels in heaven dwell in. Also to the extent that he dwells in that light intelligence and wisdom are present in him; and to the extent 
that intelligence and wisdom are present in him happiness is his. For this reason a person ought to have faith in his heart and acknowledge that nothing true or good at all originates in himself but 
that he receives everything good and true from the Lord; and this he ought to acknowledge because it is so. </p>

</p><b>5749.</b>
`Male fecistis quod fecistis':  quod significet quod contra legem Divinam sit vindicare id sibi, constat ex significatione `furti' quod hic intelligitur per `malum quod fecerunt', quod sit vindicare 
sibi quod Domini est, nempe verum quod per `scyphum argenti Josephi' significatur, de qua n. 5747; quod hoc contra legem Divinam sit, patet, videatur n. 2609.  Quod homo debeat nihil sibi vindicare 
quod a Domino, ita non verum et bonum, est causa ut homo in veritate sit; et quantum in veritate est tantum est in luce in qua sunt angeli {1}in caelo, et quantum in luce illa tantum est in intelligentia 
et sapientia, et quantum in intelligentia et sapientia tantum est in felicitate; haec causa est quod homo agnoscere debeat fide cordis quod nihil veri et boni sit a se, sed omne a Domino, et hoc quia 
{2}ita est.   @1 i qui$ @2 i prorsus$ </p>
