<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2309节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2309.</strong>由此可见对天堂小孩子的教育是何性质，也就是说，他们通过真理的聪明和良善的智慧被引入天使般的生命，该生命就是爱主和相爱，而纯真就在这些爱里面。但是，在世上很多人当中，对小孩子的教育却完全相反，这仅从一个例子就能明显看出来：在一座大城市的街道上，我看到一群男孩在互相打架，周围聚集了不少人，正饶有兴致的围观。我被告知，父母亲自鼓动自己的孩子斗殴。透过我双眼看到这情景的善灵和天使极其厌恶，我感觉到他们的震惊，特别是孩子的父母竟煽动他们参与这种行为。他们说这样做，将在孩子年幼的时候即扼杀从主所受一切相爱和一切纯真，把他们引入仇恨和报复；结果，他们有意将自己的孩子关在天堂的门外，因为天堂只有相爱。愿每位真为自己的子女着想的父母们都引以为戒。<br />前一章（创世记17章）末尾讲述了最后的审判，本章（创世记18章）末尾则讲述了小孩子在来世的状态。这几节所引用的这些事都是我在灵人界和天使天堂中的所见所闻。</p>

From what has been adduced we can see what is the nature of the education of little children in heaven, namely, that by means of the intelligence of truth and the wisdom of good they are introduced into 
the angelic life, which is love to the Lord, and mutual love, in which loves there is innocence. But how contrary is the education of little children on earth, with many, has been evidenced from this 
one example. I was in the street of a great city, and saw little boys fighting with one another. A crowd gathered and looked on with much pleasure; and I was informed that the parents themselves urge 
on their little boys to such fights. The good spirits and angels who saw these things through my eyes were so averse to them that I perceived their horror, especially at the fact that the parents 
incite them to such things; saying that thus in their earliest age they extinguish all the mutual love and all the innocence which little children receive from the Lord, and initiate them into hatred 
and revenge; consequently that they deliberately shut out their children from heaven, where there is nothing but mutual love. Let parents therefore who wish well to their children beware of such things.  
    At the end of the preceding seventeenth chapter of Genesis the Last Judgment is treated of, and at the end of this eighteenth chapter the state of little children in the other life-in both cases 
from experience of things which have been seen and heard in the world of spirits and in the heaven of angels.

All that has been presented above shows the character of young children's upbringing in heaven, namely that it is through intelligence and wisdom - which essentially are truth and good respectively - 
that they are brought into the angelic life, which consists in love to the Lord and mutual love, which loves have innocence within them. But how contrary this is to the upbringing of young children among 
many people on earth was made clear by this single example: I was in the street of a large city and saw small boys fighting one another. A crowd gathered which watched what was happening with great 
pleasure. I was also told that the parents themselves encourage their small boys to engage in such fighting. The good spirits and angels who through my eyes saw what was going on were so appalled that 
I sensed their horror, especially at the parents encouraging them to behave in such ways. These good spirits and angels declared that by doing this the parents annihilate in the earliest years of 
life all the mutual love and all the innocence which young children receive from the Lord, and lead them into ways of hatred and vengeance. As a consequence they deliberately shut their children out of 
heaven where nothing but mutual love reigns. Let parents therefore who desire what is good for their young children be on their guard against such things. </p>
<p>At the end of the previous chapter - Gen. <a href="17.htm">17</a> - the Last Judgement was the subject, at the end of this chapter - Gen. <a href="18.htm">18</a> - the state of young children in the next life; and in both sections experience of those things seen and heard in the world 
of spirits and in the angelic heaven has been drawn on. </p>

Ex his quae allata, constare potest qualis est educatio infantum in caelo, nempe quod per intelligentiam veri et sapientiam boni introducantur in vitam angelicam, quae est amor in Dominum et amor mutuus 
in quibus est innocentia: sed quam contraria sit educatio infantum in terra apud plures, constare potuit ab unico hoc exemplo.  Eram in platea urbis magnae et vidi puerulos inter se dimicantes; affluebat 
turba quae hoc multa voluptate aspectabat; et instructus quod ipsi parentes excitent puerulos liberos ad tales pugnas.  Spiritus boni et angeli qui illa per oculos meos videbant, illa ita aversabantur 
ut horrorem perciperem, et maxime ex eo quod parentes eos a talia incitent; dicentes quod sic in prima aetate exstinguant omnem amorem mutuum et omnem innocentiam quae infantibus a Domino, et 
illos in odia et vindictas initient; consequenter quod liberos suos suo studio ex caelo excludant ubi nihil nisi amor mutuus: caveant itaque a talibus parentes qui infantibus suis bonum volunt. 	Ad 
finem capitis praecedentis xvii Gen. agitur de `ultimo Judicio,' ad finem hujus capitis xviii Gen. de statu infantum in altera vita, utrumque ab experientia illorum, quae visa et audita sunt in mundo 
spirituum et caelo angelorum. </p>
