<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9709.</strong>那些内在人已经关闭的人不知道内在人的存在，也不相信天堂和永生的真实存在。让人诧异的是，这些人甚至认为自己比别人更聪明；因为他们爱自己和自己的东西，崇拜这些东西。那些内在人向天堂打开，一直通向主的人则不然，因为这些人生活在天堂之光中，因而处于来自主的光照中；而前者不是生活在天堂之光中，而是生活在尘世之光中，因而处于来自自己的光照中。那些从自己，而不是从主那里得光照的人视虚假为真理，视邪恶为良善。</p>

Those with whom the Internal Man has been closed, do not know that there is an Internal Man, neither do they believe that there is a heaven and an eternal life. And wonderful to say they nevertheless 
suppose that they think more wisely than others; for they love themselves and what belongs to them, and these they worship. It is otherwise in the case of those with whom the Internal Man has been opened 
toward heaven unto the Lord, for these are in the light of heaven, thus in illumination from the Lord; whereas the former are not in the light of heaven, but in the light of the world, and thus in 
illumination from self. Those who are illumined from self, and not from the Lord, see falsity as truth and evil as good. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 27 </p>
<p>     1. And thou shalt make the altar of shittim wood, five 
cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth; the altar shall be foursquare; and the height thereof shall be three cubits.      2. And thou shalt make its horns upon the four corners thereof; from 
it shall be its horns; and thou shalt overlay it with brass.      3. And thou shalt make its pans to take away its ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its fleshhooks, and its fire-tongs; 
all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.      4. And thou shalt make for it a grating, a network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four rings of brass, upon the four extremities of 
it.      5. And thou shalt bestow it under the compass of the altar beneath, and the net shall be even unto the middle of the altar.      6. And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim 
wood, and shalt overlay them with brass.      7. And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in carrying it.      8. Hollow of boards 
shalt thou make it; as thou wast made to see in the mountain, so shall they make it.      9. And thou shalt make the court of the Habitation at the corner of the south southward; the hangings for 
the court shall be of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits the length at the one corner.      10. And the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and their bases twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and 
their fillets shall be of silver.      11. And so at the corner of the north in length, there shall be hangings a hundred cubits in length, and the pillars there of twenty, and their bases twenty, 
of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.      12. And the breadth of the court at the corner of the sea shall be hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars ten, and their bases ten.  
    13. And the breadth of the court at the corner of the east eastward shall be fifty cubits.      14. And the hangings for the one wing shall be fifteen cubits; the pillars thereof three, and 
their bases three.      15. And for the other wing shall be hangings of fifteen cubits; the pillars thereof three, and their bases three.      16. And for the gate of the court a covering of twenty 
cubits, of blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; its pillars four, and their bases four.      17. All the pillars of the court round about shall 
be filleted with fillets of silver; their hooks of silver, and their bases of brass.      18. The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty; and the height five 
cubits, of fine twined linen, and their bases of brass.      19. And as for all the vessels of the Habitation in all the service thereof, all the pegs thereof, and all the pegs of the court, shall 
be of brass.      20. And thou shalt command the sons of Israel, and let them take unto thee olive oil, pure, beaten, for the luminary, to cause the lamp to go up continually.      21. In the Tent 
of meeting, without the veil which is over the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening until morning before Jehovah; a statute of an age for their generations with the sons of Israel. </p>

Those whose internal man is closed have no knowledge of the existence of the internal man; nor do they believe in the reality of heaven and of eternal life. And what is astonishing, those people even 
suppose that they are wiser than others in their thinking; for they love themselves and what is their own, and adore it. It is different with those whose internal man is opened towards heaven, all the 
way to the Lord. They live in the light of heaven and so depend for their enlightenment on the Lord, whereas the former do not live in the light of heaven but in the light of the world and so depend 
for their enlightenment on themselves. Those who depend on themselves for enlightenment and not on the Lord see falsity as truth and evil as good.  </p>

Illi apud quos internus homo est clausus, non sciunt quod internus homo sit, nec credunt quod caelum sit, et quod vita aeterna; et quod mirum, illi usque putant se sapienter prae aliis cogitare, nam 
amant se et sua, ac adorant illa.  Aliter illi apud quos internus homo est apertus versus caelum ad Dominum; hi enim in luce caeli sunt, ita in illuminatione a Domino, illi autem non in luce caeli sunt 
sed in luce mundi, ita in illuminatione a semet; qui illuminantur a semet et non a Domino, vident falsum ut verum, ac malum ut bonum. </p>
