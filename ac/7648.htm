<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7648节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7648.</strong>“你的房屋和你众臣仆的房屋，并一切埃及人的房屋，都要充满”表虚假将在属世心智的每一个部分，从其内层到最外层中掌权。这从“充满”和“法老的房屋和他众臣仆的房屋”的含义清楚可知：“充满”是指掌权，如下文所述；“法老的房屋和他众臣仆的房屋”是指属世层中的每一个事物（参看<a href="7353.htm">7353</a>，<a href="7355.htm">7355</a>节），在引是指从它的内层到最外层，正如前面所解释的（<a href="7645.htm">7645</a>节）。“充满”之所以表示掌权，是因为当人的心智充满由邪恶所生的虚假，以致通过虚假迷惑人并作恶给予他快乐时，就说“虚假在他身上掌权”，控制他的情感本身被称为他的主导情感。那充满一个人的整个心智，也就是其思维和意愿的东西可以说处处掌权；一个人爱之高于一切，并视为终极目的的东西以这种普遍的方式掌权。它存在于其意愿和思维的每一个最小部分中。至于这种处处掌权的东西具有哪种性质，这从此人达到目的时所享受的快乐和他没有达到目的时所受的痛苦可知。在一个人里面处处掌权的东西塑造了他的灵之轮廓；其灵的脸面完全与它一致。如果掌权的是邪恶和虚假，他的灵就会披上魔鬼的形式；但如果掌权的是良善和真理，这形式就是天天使的。因为就本身而言，灵就是形式上的情感，主导情感就是本质形式本身，而它的其它一切情感则适应该形式。</p>

And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians. That this signifies that falsity will reign in each and all things in the natural, from its interior 
to its outermost, is evident from the signification of "to be filled," as being to reign (of which presently); and from the signification of the "houses of Pharaoh, the houses of all his servants, 
and the houses of all the Egyptians," as being each and all things in the natural (see n. 7353, 7355), here from its interior to its outermost (according to the things unfolded above, n. 7645). That 
"to be filled" denotes to reign, is because when the mind of man is filled with falsities from evils, insomuch that he has a delight in seducing by means of falsities and in doing evils, then it is 
said that "falsity reigns with him," and the affection itself is said to be "reigning." That is said "to reign universally" which fills the whole mind of man, that is, both his thought and his will; 
that which a man loves above all things and regards as the ultimate end, thus reigns with him; and this is in the veriest singulars of his will and of his thought. Of what nature is that which universally 
reigns, can be known from the delight when it succeeds, and from the pain when it does not succeed. That which universally reigns with a man, makes the visible presentation of his spirit, his face 
being wholly in accordance with it. If evil and falsity are that which reigns, the form of his spirit is diabolical; but if good and truth are that which reigns, the form is angelic; for regarded in 
itself the spirit is the affection in form, and the ruling affection is its veriest form, and the rest of its affections apply themselves to it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7648</b></p><p><b>7648.</b>
'And your houses will be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians' means that falsity will reign in every single thing in the natural from the inner part of it 
to the outermost. This is clear from the meaning of 'being filled' as reigning, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's houses, the houses of all his servants, and the houses of all the 
Egyptians' as every single thing in the natural, dealt with in <a href="7753.htm">7753</a>, <a href="7355.htm">7355</a>, at this point from the inner part of it to the outermost, in keeping with the explanation above in <a href="7645.htm">7645</a>. The reason why 'being 
filled' means reigning is that when a person's mind is filled with falsities arising from evils, filled so completely that leading others astray by means of falsities and doing evil give him delight, 
he is said to be ruled by this delight; and the actual affection that controls him is called his reigning affection. That which fills a person's entire mind, that is, both his thought and his will, 
is said to reign everywhere; what a person loves above all else and has as his end in view reigns in that universal way. It is present within every smallest part of his will and thought. What it is exactly 
that reigns everywhere may be recognized from the person's pleasure when he attains his ends, or his disappointment when he does not. That which reigns everywhere in a person shapes the contours 
of his spirit; the face of his spirit is in exact accord with it. If evil and falsity reign, his spirit is clothed with a devilish form; but if goodness and truth reign the form is angelic. For regarded 
in itself the spirit is affection embodied in a form; and the dominant affection is the essential form itself, while all its other affections adapt themselves to this. </p>

`Et replebuntur domus tuae, et domus omnium servorum tuorum, et domus omnium Aegyptiorum': quod significet quod regnabit falsum in omnibus et singulis in naturali ab interiore ejus ad extremum, constat 
ex significatione `repleri' quod sit regnare, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `domus Pharaonis, domus omnium servorum ejus, et domus omnium Aegyptiorum' quod sint omnia et singula in naturali, 
de qua n. 7353, 7355, hic ab interiore ejus ad extremum, secundum illa quae supra n. 7645 explicata sunt.  Quod `repleri' sit regnare, est quia cum mens hominis repleta est falsis ex malis, adeo ut 
jucundum ei sit per falsa seducere, (c)et mala facere, tunc dicitur quod id regnet apud illum, et ipsa affectio dicitur regnans; universaliter regnans dicitur id quod implet totam hominis mentem, {1}hoc 
est, tam ejus cogitationem quam voluntatem; id quod homo prae reliquis amat, et pro fine ultimo habet, hoc tale regnans est; et hoc inest omnium singularissimis ejus voluntatis et cogitationis; quodnam 
sit quod universaliter regnat, sciri potest a jucundo quando succedit et a dolorifico quando non succedit.  Hoc quod universaliter regnat apud hominem facit imaginem ejus spiritus, facies ejus est 
prorsus secundum illud; si regnans est malum et falsum, est forma ejus spiritus diabolica; si autem regnans est bonum et verum, est forma {2} angelica; nam spiritus in se spectatus {3}est affectio 
in forma, et affectio dominans est {4}ipsissima ejus forma, et reliquae ejus affectiones inapplicant se ei. 	@1 ita ejus tam voluntatem quam cogitationem$ 	@2 i ejus$ 	@3 non est nisi$ 	@4 ex qua 
et secundum quam formatus apparet$ </p>
