<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3978节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3978.</strong>创世记30:27-30.拉班对他说，愿我在你眼前蒙恩，我已算定，耶和华赐福与我是为你的缘故。又说，请你定你的工价，我就给你。雅各对他说，你知道我怎样服事你，你的牲畜在我这里怎样。我未来之先，你所有的很少，现今却发大众多，耶和华赐福与你，是因我脚立在这里。如今我什么时候才为自己的家作点儿事呢？<br />“拉班对他说”表出于“拉班”所表示的良善的觉察。“愿我在你眼前蒙恩”表一种强烈的倾向。“我已算定，耶和华赐福与我是为你的缘故”表源于神性，为了它要服务的属世层良善的缘故。“又说，请你定你的工价，我就给你”表它要凭自己给予所渴望的。“雅各对他说，你知道我怎样服事你”表它知道自己的心智和能力。“你的牲畜在我这里怎样”表这也源于神性。“我未来之先，你所有的很少”表在与属世层的良善结合之前，它的良善不生育。“现今却发大众多”表此后多结果子。“耶和华赐福与你，是因我脚立在这里”表这是由属世层所拥有的神性恩赐带来的。“如今我什么时候才为自己的家作点儿事呢”表如今它自己的良善要由此结出果实。</p>

Verses 27-30. And Laban said unto him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes, I have tested it, and Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake; and he said, Signify to me thy reward, and I will give it. 
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy substance has been with me; for it was little that thou hadst before me, and it hath burst forth into a multitude, and Jehovah 
hath blessed thee at my foot; and now when shall I also be doing for mine own house? "And Laban said unto him," signifies perception from the good which is signified by "Laban;" "If I pray I have found 
grace in thine eyes," signifies a strong inclination; "I have tested it, and Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake," signifies from the Divine, for the sake of the good of the natural, to which it was 
to be of service; "and he said, Signify to me thy reward, and I will give it," signifies that it would of itself give that which was desired; "and he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee," 
signifies that it knew its mind [animus] and its power; "and how thy substance has been with me," signifies that this also was from the Divine; "for it was little that thou hadst before me," signifies 
that its good was barren before it was conjoined; "and it hath burst forth into a multitude," signifies fruitfulness thereafter; "and Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot," signifies that it was 
from the Divine which the natural had; "and now when shall I also be doing for mine own house?" signifies that now its own good shall be made fruitful therefrom. </p>

Verses 27-30 And Laban salt to him, If now I have found grace in your eyes.... I have learned from experience, and Jehovah has blessed me for your sake. And he said, Indicate your wages to me, and I 
will give them. And [Jacob] said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me. For you had few before I came, and they have increased into a multitude; and Jehovah has 
blessed you since I set foot here. And now, when shall I, even I, provide for my own house? 'Laban said to him' means perception from the good meant by Laban. 'If now I have found grace in your eyes' 
means a strong inclination. 'I have learned from experience, and Jehovah has blessed me for your sake' means originating in the Divine, for the sake of the good of the natural which it is to serve. 
'And he said, Indicate your wages to me, and I will give them' means that it would of itself impart that which was desired. 'And [Jacob] said to him, You know how I have served you' means that it knew 
its mind and power. 'And how your cattle have fared with me' also means originating in the Divine. 'For you had few before I came' means that its good is barren before it is joined to the good of the 
natural. 'And they have increased into a multitude' means fertility after that. 'And Jehovah has blessed you since I set foot here' means resulting from the Divine endowment which the natural possessed. 
'And now, when shall I, even I, provide for my own house?' means that now its own good will be made fruitful from this. </p>

Versi 27-30.  Et dixit ad eum Laban, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, {1}expertus sum, et benedixit mihi Jehovah propter te.  Et dixit, Designa mercedem tuam super me, et dabo illam.  Et 
dixit ad eum, Tu nosti qualiter servivi tibi, et qualis fuit acquisitio tua mecum.  Quia parum quod fuit tibi ante me, et erupit ad multitudinem, et benedixit Jehovah tibimet ad pedem meum, et nunc 
quando faciam etiam ego domui meae?  `Dixit ad eum Laban' significat perceptionem ex illo bono quod significatur per Laban: </p>
<p>`Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis' significat propensionem: </p>
<p>`expertus 
sum, et benedixit mihi Jehovah propter te' significat quod ex Divino, propter bonum naturalis cui inserviturum: `et dixit, Designa mercedem tuam super me, et dabo illam' significat quod ex se 
daret quod vellet: `et dixit ad eum, Tu nosti qualiter servivi tibi' significat quod noverit ejus animum et potentiam: `et qualis fuit acquisitio tua mecum' significat etiam quod ex Divino: </p>
<p>`quia parum 
quod fuit tibi ante me' significat quod sterile ejus bonum {1}antequam conjungatur: `et erupit ad multitudinem' significat fecunditatem dein: `et benedixit Jehovah tibimet ad pedem meum' significat 
quod a Divino quod naturali: `et nunc quando faciam etiam ego domui meae?' significat quod nunc fructificabitur inde bonum suum. @1 Heb  (nahash) = `to divine, to practise enchantments.' It occurs also 
in Gen. xliv 5, 15, in reference to Joseph's cup, where S renders it by divino.$ @2 nisi as n. 3984.$ </p>
