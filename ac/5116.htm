<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5116.</strong>“开了花”表接近重生的状态。这从“开了花”的含义清楚可知，树结果之前先开花，结果是指重生的状态。如刚才（<a href="5115.htm">5115</a>节）所说的，树的发芽、开花、结果代表人的重生。长满叶子代表第一个状态，开花代表第二个状态，也就是紧接着重生之前的那个状态，结果代表第三个状态，也就是已重生之人的实际状态。正因如此，“叶子”表示属于聪明的事物，也就是信之真理（<a href="885.htm">885</a>节），因为在人重生或再生时，这些先到来；而“开花”表示属于智慧的事物，也就是信之良善，因为这些紧接着重生或再生之前到来；“果子”则表示那些属于生活的事物，也就是仁爱的行为，因为这些在重生之后到来，并构成已重生之人的实际状态。<br />这类事物存在于植物界是由于灵界的流注。然而，将一切事物都归于自然力量，丝毫不归于神性的人绝无可能相信这一点；而将一切事物都归于神性，丝毫不归于自然力量的人则能看到每一个事物的存在都是由于那流注，或也可说，一切事物皆来自神性。不仅如此，每一个事物都有一个对应关系，因而是一个代表。最终，这种人能看到，整个自然界是代表主国度的一个舞台；因此，神性存在于自然界的每一个事物里面，以致整个自然界就是永恒和无限的一个代表：代表永恒是因为物种的繁衍会无穷无尽地持续下去，直到永远；代表无限是因为种子的繁殖是无限的。这种繁殖、增多的努力永远不可能存在于植物界的每一个事物里面，除非神性不断流入它；因为努力来自流注，能量来自努力，结果来自能量。<br />将一切事物都归于自然力量的人会说，这种繁殖、增多的努力在最初创造事物时就被引入果实和种子；由于从这些努力所获得的能量，所以自那时起，果实和种子就自发进行这种活动。但这些人没有考虑到：持续存在就是不断存在，或者说，繁衍就是不断创造。他们也没有考虑到：结果是原因的延续，当原因不复存在时，结果也不复存在；因此，没有原因的持续流注，一切结果瞬间消失。他们同样没有考虑到：凡与一切事物的第一存在，因而与神性没有联系的事物都会立刻消亡；因为在先者必须不断存在于在后者，以便在后者能够存在。<br />那些将一切事物都归于自然力量，很少或几乎不归于神性的人若考虑到这些事，也能承认自然界的每一个事物皆代表诸如存在于灵界中的那类事物，因而代表诸如存在于主国度，也就是最近地代表主的神性所在之地中的那类事物。所以，有人说流注来自灵界；但这句话的意思是，流注经由灵界来自主的神性。属世人或自然主义者之所以不考虑这些事实，是因为他们不<br />愿承认它们；因为他们沉浸在世俗和肉体事物中，因而沉浸在属于自我之爱和尘世之爱的生活中，因而在属于灵界，也就是天堂的事物上陷入颠倒的次序；从颠倒的状态是不可能看见这类事物的；因为他们视在上之物为在下之物，或视高层事物为低层事物；视在下之物为在上之物，或视低层事物为高层事物。这也解释了以下事实：在来世，当这种人在天堂之光中被观之时，他们看上去头朝下，脚朝上。<br />在这些人当中，当看见树木和其它植物开花时，谁会想到这可以说是它们喜悦的表达，因为它们正在产出果实和种子？这种人所看到的一切，就是花先开了，并且一直开到果实和种子的雏形在它里面成形，树液由此被输送到它们里面。他们若对人的重生或再生有所了解，确切地说，若想要了解，就会由于这种相似性而在开花当中看见人重生前状态的代表，即：那时，由于聪明与智慧的良善，人正以同样的方式开花，也就是拥有内在的喜悦和美丽，因为现在他正努力将聪明与智慧的良善植入自己的生命，也就是说，正努力结出果实。这种人不可能知道这种状态的性质，因为那些唯独感受到尘世之爱的欢喜和自我之爱的快乐之人完全不知道被如此代表的内在喜悦和美丽的性质。这种欢喜和这些快乐使得内在之物在这种人看来，完全没有任何欢喜、快乐可言，以致这些人厌恶它们。他们因这种厌恶而弃之如敝履，或视之为没有实际存在的某种东西。结果，他们拒绝接受它们，同时否认属灵和属天事物是某种东西。当今时代被视为智慧的疯狂便由此而来。</p>

Its blossom went up. That this signifies the state near regeneration, is evident from the signification of the "blossom" that buds forth from the tree before the fruit, as being the state before regeneration. 
As just said (n. 5115), the budding and fruiting of a tree represent the rebirth of man-its becoming green from the leaves represents the first state; the blossoming the second, which is the 
next before regeneration; and the fruiting the third, which is the very state of the regenerate. It is from this that "leaves" signify the things of intelligence, or the truths of faith (n. 885), for 
these are the first things of the rebirth or regeneration; while "blossoms" signify the things of wisdom, or the goods of faith, because these immediately precede the rebirth or regeneration; and "fruits" 
signify those things which are of life, or the works of charity, because these follow and constitute the very state of the regenerate. [2] That such things exist in the vegetable kingdom is owing 
to the influx of the spiritual world. This, however, cannot be believed by those who attribute all things to nature, and nothing to the Divine; whereas they who attribute all things to the Divine, 
and nothing to nature, are permitted to see not only that everything is from the Divine, but also that everything has a correspondence, and is therefore representative; and finally they are permitted 
to see that universal nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom; thus that the Divine is in every particular of nature, insomuch that nature is a representation of the eternal and the infinite-of 
the eternal from propagation even to eternity, of the infinite from the multiplication of seeds to infinity. Such endeavors could never have existed in everything in the vegetable kingdom unless 
the Divine continually flowed in; for from influx comes endeavor, from endeavor energy, and from energy effect. [3] They who attribute all things to nature say that such things were imparted to 
fruits and seeds at their first creation, and that from the energy thence received they are afterward impelled of themselves to such activities; but they do not consider that subsistence is a perpetual 
coming into existence, or what is similar, that propagation is perpetual creation; neither do they consider that the effect is the continuation of the cause, and that when the cause ceases, the effect 
also ceases, and consequently that without a continual influx of the cause, every effect instantly perishes; nor do they consider that what is unconnected with a first of all things, consequently 
with the Divine, is instantly annihilated, because the prior must be continually in the posterior in order that the posterior may exist.  [4] If they who attribute all things to nature and little or 
nothing to the Divine, considered these things, they too could acknowledge that each and all things in nature represent such things as are in the spiritual world, consequently such as are in the Lord's 
kingdom, where the Divine of the Lord is most nearly represented. For this reason it was said that the influx is from the spiritual world; but it is meant that the influx is through the spiritual world 
from the Lord's Divine. The reason why natural men do not consider such things is that they are not willing to acknowledge them; for they are in earthly and bodily things, and hence in a life of the 
love of self and of the world, and therefore are in inverted order relatively to those things which are of the spiritual world or of heaven, and from an inverted state it is impossible to see such 
things; for they see the things which are below as if they were above, and the things which are above as if they were below; and therefore when in the other life such persons are seen in the light of 
heaven, they appear with the head downward and the feet upward.  [5] Who among them is there that sees trees and other plants in blossom, and deems that this is as it were their gladness because they 
are now producing fruits or seeds? They see that blossoms precede, and that they last until they have in their bosoms the beginnings of the fruit or seed, and thereby convey into these beginnings their 
sap; and if they knew anything about the rebirth or regeneration of man (or rather, if they desired to know), they would from this likeness see in the flowers a representative of the state of man before 
regeneration, namely, that man then blossoms in like manner from the good of intelligence and wisdom, that is, is in interior gladness and beauty, because he is then in the effort to implant in 
the life the goods of intelligence and wisdom, that is, to produce fruits. That this state is of such a nature cannot even be known, because the nature of the interior gladness and beauty which are thus 
represented is utterly unknown to those who are solely in the gladness of the love of the world and the delights of the love of self. This gladness and these delights cause those which are interior 
to appear to such persons so utterly joyless and undelightful that they hold them in aversion; and the result of this is that they reject them as trivial, or of no value, and therefore deny them, and 
at the same time deny that what is spiritual and celestial is anything. From this comes the insanity of the present age, which is believed to be wisdom. </p>

'Its blossom came up' means the state next to regeneration. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blossom' which appears on the tree before the fruit as the state before regeneration. The budding and 
fruiting of a tree represents, as stated immediately above in <a href="5115.htm">5115</a>, the person's rebirth. Becoming covered with leaves represents the first state, with blossom the second, that is, the one immediately 
before regeneration, and fruiting the third, which is the actual state of one who has been regenerated. Consequently 'leaves' means the things that belong to intelligence, which are the truths of faith, <a href="885.htm">885</a>, for these come first in a person's rebirth or regeneration. By 'blossoms' however are meant the things that belong to wisdom, which are the goods of faith, since these come immediately before 
rebirth or regeneration, while 'fruits' means the things that are matters of life, which are the works of charity, in that these come after rebirth and constitute the actual state of one who is regenerate. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
These features of the vegetable kingdom owe their existence to the influx of the spiritual world into it; but people who attribute everything to natural forces and nothing to the Divine 
are in no way able to believe this. Those however who attribute everything to the Divine and nothing to natural forces have the ability to see that every single thing owes its existence to that influx. 
Not only that, each individual thing also has a correspondence, and because it has a correspondence it is a representative. In the end such people have the ability to see that the whole natural system 
is a theatre representative of the Lord's kingdom, thus that the Divine exists within each individual thing, so much so that the whole natural system is a representation of that which is eternal 
and infinite - eternal because the reproduction of species continues without end, infinite because the multiplication of seeds is unlimited. Such endeavours to reproduce and multiply could not possibly 
come to exist in each individual thing in the vegetable kingdom if the Divine were not flowing into it unceasingly. This influx is what provides the impulse to reproduce and to multiply; the impulse 
brings the power to make this a reality, and that power leads to the actual realization of it.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 People who attribute everything to natural forces say that such impulses to reproduce and to multiply 
were introduced into fruits and seeds when things were first created, and because of the power which they have received from those impulses fruits and seeds ever since then are carried spontaneously 
into such activities. But those people do not take into consideration the fact that continuance in being is constant coming into being, or what is much the same, that reproduction is creation taking 
place constantly. Nor do they take into consideration the fact that an effect is the continuation of its cause, and that when a cause ceases to exist so does the effect, and consequently that without 
constant influx from its cause every effect perishes in an instant. Neither do they take into consideration the fact that anything that is not linked to the first being of all, consequently to the 
Divine, instantly ceases to have any existence; for to have any being, what is posterior must have what is prior existing unceasingly within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 If those attributing everything to natural forces 
and little, scarcely anything, to the Divine were to take these facts into consideration they would also be able to acknowledge that every single thing in the natural system represents something akin 
to it in the spiritual world, and therefore something akin to it in the Lord's kingdom, where the closest representation of the Lord's Divine exists. This is why reference has been made to an influx 
coming from the spiritual world; but by this is meant an influx from the Lord's Divine coming by way of the spiritual world. The reason adherents to naturalism do not take such facts into consideration 
is that they are not willing to acknowledge them, since they are immersed in earthly and bodily interests and as a consequence in the life belonging to self-love and love of the world. As a result, 
so far as things belonging to the spiritual world, that is, to heaven are concerned, the complete reverse of true order exists with them; and to view such matters from within a state in which order 
is turned around is not possible, since higher things are then seen as lower ones, and lower things as higher ones. This also accounts for the fact that, when persons like these are seen in the next life 
in the light of heaven, they are seen with their heads pointing downwards and their feet upwards.  </p>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 Who among these, when he sees blossom on a tree or on anything else that grows, thinks of 
it as an expression of gladness so to speak that fruit and seeds are now being brought forth? All that such persons see is that blossom comes first and remains until rudimentary forms of the fruit and 
seeds are formed within it, whereby sap is conveyed into them. If they knew anything about human rebirth or regeneration, or rather if they wanted to know, they would also see in that blossom, because 
of the similarity there, a representative of a person's state before regeneration. They would see that because of the good which his intelligence and wisdom desires he is in a similar way blooming, 
that is, he possesses an inner gladness and beauty, because now he is endeavouring to implant these - that is to say, forms of good desired by intelligence and wisdom - in his life; that is, he is endeavouring 
to bear fruit. Such persons cannot know about the nature of this state because knowledge of what that inner gladness and inner beauty so represented are does not exist at all with people who 
feel no gladness other than that which accompanies love of the world and no delight other than that connected with self-love. Worldly or selfish feelings of gladness or delight cause inner ones to be 
seen as the opposite of gladness and delight, so much so that those persons loathe them. In loathing them they also brush them aside as something worthless or as something that has no actual existence. 
As a consequence they refuse to accept them, and at the same time they refuse to accept that what is spiritual or celestial is really anything at all. This is how the absurd thinking of the present 
day which is believed to be wisdom comes about. </p>

`Et ascendit flos illius'; quod significet statum prope regenerationem, constat ex significatione `floris' qui egerminat ex arbore ante fructum quod sit status ante regenerationem; arboris germinatio 
et fructificatio repraesentat, ut mox supra n. 5115 dictum est, hominis renascentiam, virescentia ex foliis primum statum, efflorescentia alterum, seu proximum ante regenerationem, et fructificatio 
tertium, qui est ipse status regenerati; inde est quod `folia' significent illa quae sunt intelligentiae seu vera fidei, n. 885, nam haec sunt prima renascentiae seu regenerationis, `flores' autem 
illa quae sunt sapientiae seu bona fidei, quia haec proxime praecedunt ante renascentiam seu regenerationem, et `fructus' illa quae sunt vitae seu opera charitatis, quippe haec sequuntur et constituunt 
ipsum statum regenerati.  [2] Quod talia existant in regno vegetabili, est ex influxu mundi spiritualis; sed hoc nequaquam credere possunt illi qui naturae omnia tribuunt, et nihil Divino; </p>
<p>at 
qui tribuunt omnia Divino et nihil naturae, illis datur videre quod singula inde sint, nec solum quod inde sint, sed etiam quod singula correspondeant et quia correspondent, quod repraesentent; </p>
<p>et 
denique datur eis videre quod universa natura sit theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini, ita quod Divinum in singulis sit, usque adeo ut quoque sit repraesentatio aeterni et infiniti, aeterni 
ex propagatione usque in aeternum, infiniti ex multiplicatione seminum in infinitum; tales conatus nusquam inexistere potuissent singulis in regno vegetabili nisi continue influeret Divinum; ex influxu 
est conatus, ex conatu est vis, et ex vi effectus; [3] qui naturae tribuunt omnia, dicunt quod talia fructibus et seminibus indita sint in prima creatione, et quod ex vi inde accepta ex se {1} 
postea in talia ferantur, sed illi non considerant quod subsistentia sit perpetua existentia, seu simile, quod propagatio sit perpetua creatio; nec considerant quod effectus sit continuum causae, 
et quod cessante causa (c)esset effectus, et inde quod omnis effectus absque influxu causae continuo, momento pereat; tum nec considerant quod inconnexum ab omnium primo, consequenter a Divino, momento 
in nihilum cadat, prius enim continue erit in posteriore, ut posterius sit; [4] si illi qui naturae omnia tribuunt et Divino tam parum ut vix aliquid, considerarent illa, potuissent etiam agnoscere 
quod omnia et singula in natura repraesentent talia quae in spirituali mundo sunt, proinde quae in regno Domini, ubi Divinum Domini proxime repraesentatur; inde dictum est quod influxus sit ex 
spirituali mundo, sed intelligitur quod influxus sit per spiritualem mundum a Divino Domini; causa quod homines naturales talia non considerent, est quia non volunt agnoscere, sunt enim {2} in terrestribus 
et corporeis et inde in vita amorum sui et mundi, proinde in prorsus inverso ordine respective ad illa quae sunt mundi spiritualis seu caeli, et ex inverso statu videre talia, impossibile 
est, quae enim infra sunt, vident ut superiora, et quae supra sunt, ut inferiora; </p>
<p>quapropter etiam tales in altera vita cum apparent in luce caeli, apparent capite deorsum et pedibus sursum.  [5] 
Quis eorum est qui dum videt flores in arbore, et in reliquis germinibus, considerat quod eorum quasi laetificatio sit, quod nunc fructus aut semina producant? vident quod flores praecedant, et continuentur 
usque dum initiamenta fructus vel seminis in suo sinu habent, ac sic traducant succum suum in illa; si aliquid de renascentia seu regeneratione hominis scirent, aut potius si scire vellent, 
ex similitudine quoque repraesentativum status hominis ante regenerationem (o)in floribus illis viderent, quod nempe homo tunc ex bono intelligentiae et sapientiae similiter floreat, hoc est, in interiore 
laetitia sit, inque pulchritudine, quia tunc in nisu implantandi illa, nempe bona intelligentiae et sapientiae, vitae, hoc est, faciendi fructus; quod ille status talis sit, nec sciri potest 
quia quid interior laetitia et quid interior pulchritudo, quae repraesentantur, prorsus non scitur ab illis qui solum in laetis amoris mundi et in jucundis amoris sui sunt; illa laeta et haec 
jucunda faciunt ut illa appareant illaeta et injucunda, usque adeo ut aversentur illa, et cum aversantur illa, etiam rejiciunt sicut quoddam nauci aut sicut quoddam nihili, consequenter negant illa,
