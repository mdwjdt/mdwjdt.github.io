<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8522节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8522.</strong>“味道如同蜜饼”表良善是令人快乐的，因为它一开始是真理，但通过快乐被作成了良善。这从“味道”、“饼”和“蜜”的含义清楚可知：“味道”论及属于良善的快乐，因为它对应于变得智慧的快乐（参看<a href="3502.htm">3502</a>，<a href="4793.htm">4793</a>节）；“饼”（cake）是指属灵良善（参看<a href="7978.htm">7978</a>节）；“蜜”是指属世的快乐（<a href="5620.htm">5620</a>，<a href="6857.htm">6857</a>节）。从这些含义可推知，“味道如同蜜饼”表示良善是令人快乐的，因为它通过快乐由真理作成。此处描述了属灵良善，即它源于何处，如何产生，因而也描述了它的性质。也就是说，就其最初起源而言，它是真理，但因以下事实而被作成良善：它从意愿，因而从情感进入行为。因为凡人出于情感所意愿的，都被视为良善，并因此也被称为良善。然而，这良善若不通过属于属世人的快乐，就无法产生。属灵人通过它们被引入这良善；并且一旦被引入这良善，他就能拥有对它的感觉。这就是“吗哪的味道如同蜜饼”所表示的。</p>

And the taste of it was like that of a cake in honey. That this signifies that the good was delightful because it had been made from truth by means of delight, is evident from the signification of "the 
taste" [saporis], as being predicated of the delights that belong to good, because it corresponds to the delight of growing wise [sapiendi] (see n. 3502, 4793); from the signification of "a cake," 
as being spiritual good (see n. 7978); and from the signification of "honey," as being natural delight (n. 5620, 6857). From all this it follows that "the taste of it was like that of a cake in honey" 
signifies the good which is delightful because made from truth by means of delight. The source and method of arising, and thus the nature, of spiritual good are here described, namely that in its first 
origin it is truth, and that it is made good by the fact that it comes into act from the will, thus from affection; for whatever man wills from affection is perceived as good. But this good cannot 
arise except through the delights that are of the natural man. The spiritual man is introduced by means of these, and when he has been introduced, he has a consequent sense of this good. This then is 
what is signified by "the taste of the manna was like that of a cake in honey." </p>

'And the taste of it was like that of a cake with honey' means that the good was delightful, like that which began as truth but was made into good by means of delight This is clear from the meaning of 
'the tastes as that which has reference to delight taken in what is good, since it corresponds to the delight of becoming wise,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> dealt with in <a href="3502.htm">3502</a>, <a href="4793.htm">4793</a>; from the meaning of 'a cake' as spiritual good, 
dealt with in <a href="7978.htm">7978</a>; and from the meaning of 'honey' as natural delight, dealt with in <a href="5620.htm">5620</a>, <a href="6857.htm">6857</a>. From these meanings it follows that 'the taste of it was like that of a cake with honey' means good 
that was delightful because it was made out of truth by means of delight. Here spiritual good is being described - where it originates and how it comes into being, thus also the essential nature of 
it. That is to say, in its first beginnings this good is truth, but this is made good when it passes from the will, and so from affection, into action. For whatever a person wills out of affection for 
it is seen as good, and is therefore also called good. Yet this good can be brought into being only by means of the delights that belong to the natural man. The spiritual man is brought to that good 
by means of them; and once he has been brought to it he is able to have a feeling for it. This then is what is meant by 'the taste of the manna was like that of a cake with honey'.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> The Latin noun 
translated the taste is sapor; and the verb translated here as becoming wise is sapere, the primary meaning of which is to taste. </p>

`Et sapor ejus sicut placentae in melle': quod significet bonum quod jucundum, sicut quod ex vero per jucundum factum bonum, constat ex significatione `saporis' quod praedicetur de jucundis quae boni, 
quia correspondet jucundo sapiendi, de qua n. 3502, 4793, ex significatione `placentae' quod sit bonum spirituale, de qua n. 7978, et ex significatione `mellis' quod sit jucundum naturale, de qua n. 
5620, 6857; ex his sequitur quod `sapor ejus sicut placentae in melle' (x)significet bonum quod jucundum quia factum per jucundum ex vero; hic describitur bonum spirituale unde et quomodo existit, (c)ac 
sic quale est; quod nempe bonum illud sit verum in prima sua origine, et quod bonum fiat ex eo quod ex voluntate, {1} ita ex affectione in actum veniat; quicquid enim homo ex affectione vult, hoc 
appercipitur ut bonum et ideo etiam vocatur bonum; sed hoc bonum non existere potest quam per jucunda quae sunt naturalis hominis; per ea homo spiritualis introducitur, et cum introductus est, sensum 
ejus inde habet; hoc nunc est quod significatur per quod `sapor mannae esset sicut placentae in melle.' 	@1 i ac$ </p>
