<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5536节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5536.</strong>“你们使我丧失我的孩子”表如此教会就不复存在了。这从雅各的代表和“丧失”的含义清楚可知。指着自己说这句话的雅各是指真理之良善（参看<a href="3659.htm">3659</a>，<a href="3669.htm">3669</a>，<a href="3677.htm">3677</a>，<a href="3775.htm">3775</a>，<a href="4234.htm">4234</a>，<a href="4273.htm">4273</a>，<a href="4538.htm">4538</a>节）；它因是真理之良善，故也是教会，因为良善才是教会的本质要素；因此，无论你说真理之良善，还是说教会，意思都一样，因为有真理之良善与他同在的人就有教会与他同在。“雅各”代表教会（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4520.htm">4520</a>节），他的儿子们代表教会真理（<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）。“丧失”是指剥夺教会的真理与良善，在此是指剥夺由约瑟、便雅悯和西缅所代表的那类真理，如下文所述。<br />“丧失”之所以表示剥夺教会的真理，是因为教会好比一个婚姻，它的良善好比丈夫，它的真理好比妻子，由该婚姻所生的真理好比儿子，所生的良善好比女儿，等等。因此，当提到丧失的状态或丧失的行为时，它表示教会被剥夺了真理，由此不再是一个教会。就这层意义而言，“丧失”（bereft，经上或译为丧掉、蹧践）或“丧子”（bereavement）也用于圣言其它各个地方，如以西结书：<br />我必打发饥荒和恶兽到你那里去，叫你丧子。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.17.htm">5:17</a>）<br /><br />我若使恶兽经过那地而蹧践它，使地荒凉，以至因这些野兽，人都不得经过。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结14.15.htm">14:15</a>）<br />利未记：<br />我也要打发田间的野兽到你们中间，使你们丧失儿女，剪灭你们的牲畜，使你们的人数减少，道路荒凉。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.22.htm">26:22</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“饥荒”表示缺乏对良善与真理的认知，因而是指荒凉；“恶兽”是指源于邪恶的虚假；“地”是指教会；“打发饥荒和恶兽使地丧子”表示利用源于邪恶的虚假摧毁教会，因而是指彻底剥夺教会的真理。耶利米书：<br />我在这地的城门口，用簸箕簸了他们，使他们丧掉儿女。我毁灭我的百姓。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.7.htm">15:7</a>）<br />此处“丧掉”也表示剥夺真理。同一先知书：<br />愿你将他们的儿女交与饥荒，使他们被刀剑之手除灭；愿他们的妻丧子，且作寡妇。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.21.htm">18:21</a>）<br />“愿他们的妻丧子，且作寡妇”表示没有真理和良善。<br />何西阿书：<br />至于以法莲人，他们的荣耀必如鸟飞去，必不生产，不怀胎，不成孕。纵然养大儿女，我却必使他们丧人。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.11.htm">9:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处意思是一样的。以西结书：<br />我必使人，就是我的民，行在你上面。他们必得你为业，你必做他们的产业，你也不再使他们丧子。主耶和华如此说，因为人对你说，你是吞吃人的，又使你的民丧子。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.12.htm">36:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“丧子”也表示剥夺真理。<br />以赛亚书：<br />你这专好宴乐、安然居住的，现在当听这话。你心中说，惟有我，除我以外再没有别的，我必不至寡居，也不知丧子之事。哪知，丧子、寡居这两件事在一日转眼之间必临到你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.8.htm">47:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论及巴比伦和迦勒底的女儿，也就是那些外在神圣，内在亵渎，并凭这神圣的外在自称教会的人。“丧子、寡居”表示剥夺良善与真理。<br />你举目向四方观看，他们都聚集来到你这里。你丧子以后所生的儿女还要在你耳边说，这地方我居住太窄，请让地方给我，让我居住。但你心里必说，我既丧子独居，是被放逐的，漂流在外，谁给我生这些，谁将这些养大呢？我独自一人被撇下，这些在哪里呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.18.htm">49:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.20.htm">20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这论及锡安，或属天教会，论及它荒废之后的结实；“丧子”表示它在荒废时被剥夺的真理，但这些真理又得以恢复并剧增。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5536</b></p><p><b>5536.</b>
Me have ye bereaved. That this signifies that thus the church was no more, is evident from the representation of Jacob, who says this of himself, as being the good of truth (see n. 3659, 3669, 3677, 
3775, 4234, 4273, 4538); and because it is the good of truth, it is also the church, for good is the essential of the church; and therefore it is the same whether we say the good of truth, or the church, 
for with the man with whom is the good of truth, there is the church (that "Jacob" is the church may be seen above, n. 4286, 4520; and hence also that his sons represent the truths of the church, 
n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512); and from the signification of "bereaving," as being to deprive the church of its truths and goods, as here of those which are represented by Joseph, Benjamin, and Simeon 
(of which in what follows).  [2] That "to bereave" denotes to deprive the church of its truths, is because the church is compared to a marriage, its good to the husband, and its truth to the wife, 
and the truths born of this marriage to sons, and the goods to daughters, and so on. When therefore "bereavement," or "bereaving" is spoken of, it signifies that the church is deprived of its truths, 
and that thereby it becomes no church. In this sense the terms "bereavement," or "bereaving," are occasionally used elsewhere in the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	I will send upon you famine and evil beast, 
and will make thee bereaved (Ezek. 5:17). And again: </p>
<p>	When I make the evil beast to pass through the land, and it shall bereave it, so that it become a desolation, that no man may pass through because 
of the wild beast (Ezek. 14:15). In Leviticus: </p>
<p>	I will send against you the wild beast of the field, which shall bereave you, and cut off your beast, and lessen you, that your ways shall be laid 
waste (Lev. 26:22). [3] In these passages "famine" denotes a lack of the knowledges of good and truth, and hence desolation; an "evil beast," falsities from evils; the "land," the church; "sending 
a famine and an evil beast to bereave the land" denotes to destroy the church by falsities from evils, thus to completely deprive it of truths. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	I will winnow them with a fan in the gates 
of the land, I will bereave, I will destroy My people (Jer. 15:7); </p>
<p>where also "bereaving" denotes to deprive of truths. In the same: </p>
<p>	Give their sons to the famine, and make them flow away by the 
hand of the sword; that their wives may become bereaved and widows (Jer. 18:21); </p>
<p>where "their wives becoming bereaved and widows" denotes being without truths and good. [4] In Hosea: </p>
<p>	Of Ephraim, their 
glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the belly, and from conception; because if they have brought up their sons, then will I make them bereaved of man (Hos. 9:11-12); </p>
<p>with 
a similar meaning. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	I will make man, My people, walk over you, who shall possess thee by inheritance, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more add to bereave them. Thus 
hath said the Lord Jehovih, Because they say to you, Thou art a consumer of man, and hast been a bereaver of thy peoples (Ezek. 36:12-13); </p>
<p>where also "bereaving" is to deprive of truths, [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>	Now 
hear this, O delicate one, sitting securely, saying in thine heart, I and none besides like me, I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know bereavement; surely these two things shall come 
to thee in a moment in one day, bereavement and widowhood (Isa. 47:8-9); </p>
<p>said of the daughter of Babylon and of Chaldea, that is, of those who are in a holy external and a profane internal, and by virtue 
of this holy external call themselves the church. "Bereavement and widowhood" denote the deprivation of good and truth. Again: </p>
<p>	Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves 
together, they come to thee. The sons of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is strait for me; go from me that I may dwell. But thou shalt say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me 
these, seeing I am bereaved and lonely, banished and far away? Who therefore hath brought up these? I was left alone; these, where were they? (Isa. 49:18, 20-21); </p>
<p>said of Zion or the celestial church, 
and of its fruitfulness after vastation; the "sons of bereavement" denoting the truths of which she had been deprived in vastation, restored and vastly increased. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5536</b></p><p><b>5536.</b>
'You have bereaved me [of my children]' means that thus no Church existed any longer. This is clear from the representation of Jacob, the one who says this about himself, as the good of truth, dealt 
with in <a href="3659.htm">3659</a>, <a href="3669.htm">3669</a>, <a href="3677.htm">3677</a>, <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="4234.htm">4234</a>, <a href="4273.htm">4273</a>, <a href="4538.htm">4538</a> (and as the good of truth is represented, so also is the Church because good is the essential element of the Church. It therefore amounts to the same whether 
you say the good of truth or the Church, for the person who has the good of truth present with him has the Church present with him. 'Jacob' represents the Church, see <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4520.htm">4520</a>, and that being 
so his sons represent the truths known to the Church, <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>); and from the meaning of 'bereaving' as depriving the Church of its truths and forms of good, such as those here which 
are represented by Joseph, Benjamin, and Simeon, to whom reference is made directly after the words 'you have bereaved me'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Bereaving' is depriving the Church of its truths for the reason 
that the Church is likened to a marriage. Good is likened to the husband and truth to the wife, while the truths born from that marriage are likened to 'the sons' and the forms of good to 'the daughters', 
and so on. When therefore a state of bereavement or an action causing this is mentioned, the meaning is that the Church has been deprived of its truths and as a consequence ceases to be a Church. 
The expressions 'bereft' and 'bereavement' are also used in various other places in the Word, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will send famine and evil wild animals upon you, and I will make you bereft. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%205:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 5:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
When I cause evil wild animals to pass through the land and they leave it bereft so that it becomes a desolation, with the result that no one passes through on account 
of the wild animals. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2014:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 14:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Leviticus, </p>
<blockquote>
I will send into you the wild animals of the field, which will leave you bereft and will cut off your beasts,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and make you few in number, so that 
your roads are laid waste. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In these quotations 'famine' stands for an absence of cognitions of good and truth and the consequent desolation, 'evil wild animals' for falsities derived 
from evils, and 'the land' for the Church. 'Sending famine and evil wild animals, and leaving the land bereft' stands for destroying the Church by means of falsities derived from evils and so depriving 
it completely of truths. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will winnow them with a winnowing-fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave, I will destroy My people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2015:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 15:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'bereaving' stands for 
depriving of truths. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Give their children over to the famine, and cause them to be wiped out by the power of the sword,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> so that their wives become bereaved [of children] and 
widows. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2018:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 18:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'So that their wives become bereaved and widows' stands for their being left without truths or good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
As for the Ephraimites, their glory will fly away like 
a bird, away from birth, and from the belly, and from conception. Even if they bring up their sons, I will make them bereft of human beings. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
will cause human beings to walk upon you, even My people; and those human beings will by inheritance take possession of you and you will be an inheritance to them; no more will you bereave them 
[of their children]. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Because they say to you, You have been one devouring human beings and one bereaving your peoples [of children]. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2036:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 36:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'bereaving' 
stands for depriving of truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Now hear this, you lover of pleasures, sitting securely, saying in her<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> heart, I am, and there is no one else like me; a widow I shall not sit, 
nor shall I know bereavement [of children]. But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day-bereavement and widowhood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2047:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 47:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the daughter of Babel and to Chaldea, 
that is, to those who are outwardly holy but inwardly unholy and who call themselves the Church by virtue of that outward holiness. 'Bereavement and widowhood' stands for a deprivation of truth and 
good. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Lift up your eyes round about, and see; they all gather together, they come to you. The children of your bereavements will say again in your ears, The place is too narrow 
for me; yield me a place to dwell in. But you will say in your heart, Who has begotten these for me, when yet I am bereft [of children] and alone, an exile and one who has been displaced? Who therefore 
has brought these up? I was left, alone. These, where were they? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:18,%2020,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:18, 20, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Zion, which is the celestial Church, and to its fruitfulness after it had been laid waste. 
'The sons of bereavements' stands for the truths of which it was deprived when laid waste, but which were restored and underwent enormous increase.

`Me orbavistis': quod significet quod sic non Ecclesia magis, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' qui hoc de se dicit, quod sit bonum veri, de qua n. 3659, 3669, 3677, 3775, 4234, 4273, 4538; et quia 
est bonum veri, est quoque Ecclesia, nam essentiale Ecclesiae est bonum; quare sive dicas bonum veri, sive Ecclesiam, idem est, nam homo apud quem est bonum veri, apud illum est Ecclesia; quod `Jacob' 
sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 4286, 4520; inde etiam est quod `filii ejus' repraesentent vera Ecclesiae, n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512; et ex significatione `orbare' quod sit Ecclesiam suis veris (c)et 
bonis privare, ut hic illis quae repraesentantur per `Josephum, Benjaminem et Shimeonem', de quibus mox sequitur.  [2] Quod `orbare' sit privare Ecclesiam suis veris, est quia Ecclesia comparatur 
conjugio, bonum ejus `marito' et verum `uxori', et ex conjugio illo nata vera `filiis' ac bona `filiabus', et sic porro; cum itaque orbitas seu orbatio dicitur, significat quod Ecclesia privata sit suis 
veris, et quod inde nulla fiat; in hoc sensu dicitur orbus et orbitas etiam passim alibi in verbo; ut apud Ezechielem, Mittam super vos famem et feram malam, et {1} orbum faciam  te, v 17: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Quando 
feram malam transire fecero per terram, et orbaverit illam, ut fiat desolatio, ita ut non transiens propter feram, xiv 15: </p>
<p>in Levitico {2}, Mittam in vos feram agri, quae orbabit vos, 
et exscindet bestiam vestram, et imminuet vos, ut vastentur viae vestrae,  {3} xxvi 22; </p>
<p>[3] ibi `fames' pro defectu cognitionum boni et veri et inde desolatione, `fera mala' pro falsis ex malis, `terra' 
pro Ecclesia; `mittere famem et feram malam et orbare terram' pro per falsa ex malis destruere Ecclesiam, ita illam veris prorsus {4} privare: apud Jeremiam, Ventilabo eas ventilabro in portis terrae, 
orbabo, perdam  populum Meum, xv 7; </p>
<p>ibi etiam `orbare' pro privare veris: apud eundem, Da filios eorum fami, et defluere fac illos per manum gladii, ut fiant uxores eorum, orbae et viduae, xviii 
21; </p>
<p>`ut fiant uxores eorum orbae et viduae' pro quod absque veris et bono: [4] apud Hosheam, Ephraimi, sicut avis avolabit gloria eorum, a partu, et a ventre, et a conceptione; quia si educaverint 
filios suos, tunc orbos faciam eos ab homine, ix 11, 12; </p>
<p>similiter {5}: apud Ezechielem, Ambulare faciam super vobis hominem, populum Meum, qui hereditario possidebunt te, et eris illis in hereditatem, 
nec addes amplius orbare eos. Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Quoniam dicunt {6} vobis, Consumens hominem tu, et orbans populos tuos fuisti, 12, [13]; </p>
