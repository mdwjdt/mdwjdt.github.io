<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9940.</strong>“使他们可以在耶和华面前蒙悦纳”表它们里面属于主的神性之物。这从“悦纳”的含义清楚可知，“悦纳”当论及耶和华，也就是主时，是指来自祂的神性之物。因为蒙主悦纳之物就是那属于祂并与世人、灵人，或天使同在的神性之物；这时，祂在另一个人里面看见它，它因此是蒙悦纳的。来自主的事物离祂要么近，要么远；可以说它们是按祂的旨意，或美意，或同意，或许可而存在的。按祂的旨意存在的事物是离祂最近的；按祂的美意存在的事物离祂稍远一些；按祂的同意存在的事物则离得更远；按祂的许可存在的事物离祂是最远的。这些就是神性之物的流注和对它们的接受之层级；不过，每个层级都包含无数事物或方面，这些事物或方面有别于其它任何层级中的事物或方面，并与它们分离；这些无数事物或方面就是天堂的奥秘，其中只有极少数的事物或方面在人类理解的范畴之内，仅以那些按祂的许可存在的事物为例。尽管它们在最低层级，或在末位，但由于其中所包含的无数奥秘，当一个人从自然界中重复出现的循环现象，从表象，尤其从感官幻觉的视角来看待它们时，它们仍会使这个人陷入困惑。然而，相对更高层级的奥秘，也就是按主的同意、美意和旨意存在的事物来说，许可的奥秘却极少。</p>

To make them well-pleasing before Jehovah. That this signifies what is Divine of the Lord in them, is evident from the signification of "well-pleasing," when said of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, as being 
from His Divine, for that which is well- pleasing to the Lord is that which is from Him with man, spirit, or angel; for it is then in another, in whom it is looked at, and thus is well-pleasing. The 
things which are from the Lord are either nearer to, or more remote from Him; and they are said to be "from His will," "from good pleasure," "from leave," and "from permission." The things which are 
from will are most nearly from Him; those which are from good pleasure are somewhat more remotely from Him; those which are from leave still more remotely; and those which are from permission are most 
remotely from Him. These are the degrees of the influx and reception of the Divine. But each degree contains innumerable things which are distinct from those which are in any other degree; and these 
innumerable things are arcana of heaven, a few only of which fall into the human understanding. For instance, to take only those things which take place from permission, which, although they are in 
the last place, nevertheless on account of the numberless arcana therein cause a man to fall into confusion when he looks at them from the happenings of things in nature, and from appearances, and still 
more when from the fallacies of the senses. Yet the arcana of permission are comparatively few as compared with those of the higher degrees, which are the things that take place from leave, from good 
pleasure, and from will. </p>

'So that they may be pleasing before Jehovah' means what is Divine and the Lord's in them. This is clear from the meaning of 'pleasing' - when Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is the subject - as what is 
Divine and comes from Him. For what is pleasing to the Lord is that present with man, spirit, or angel, which is Divine and His; then it is another in whom He sees it, and for this reason it is pleasing. 
Things from the Lord are relatively near or further away from Him; and they are said to exist by His will, or good pleasure, or consent, or permission. Those that exist by His will are the nearest 
to Him; those that do so by His good pleasure are a little further away from Him; those that exist by His consent are further away than that; and those that do so by His permission are the furthest away 
from Him. These are degrees of influx and reception of what is Divine; but each degree contains countless aspects, which are distinct and separate from those in the next degree; and those countless 
aspects are arcana of heaven, of which only a few fall within the range of human understanding, as for example merely with those which come to exist by His permission. Although these are in the lowest 
degree, nevertheless because the arcana they embrace in that degree are countless, they confuse a person when he views them from the standpoint of cycles that recur in the natural order, appearances, 
and especially the illusions of the senses. But the arcana belonging to permission are relatively few in comparison with the arcana belonging to the higher degrees, which are the things which come 
to exist by the Lord's consent, good pleasure, and will.  </p>

`Ad beneplacitum illis coram Jehovah': quod significet Divinum Domini, in illis, constat ex significatione `beneplaciti' cum de Jehovah, hoc est, Domino, quod sit ex Divino Ipsius, nam quod beneplacet 
Domino est Divinum quod ab Ipso apud hominem, {1}spiritum et angelum, est enim tunc in alio in quo spectatur, et sic beneplacet. Quae a Domino sunt, propius {2}vel remotius ab Ipso sunt, et dicuntur 
esse ex voluntate Ipsius, ex beneplacito, ex venia, et ex permissione; quae ex voluntate, proxime ab Ipso sunt; quae ex beneplacito, paulo remotius ab Ipso sunt; quae ex venia, adhuc remotius; et quae 
ex permissione, remotissime ab Ipso sunt; hi sunt gradus influxus et receptionis Divini, sed quilibet gradus innumerabilia continet, quae distincta sunt ab illis quae in altero gradu, et innumerabilia 
illa sunt arcana caeli, quorum modo pauca cadunt in intellectum humanum; sicut solum quae fiunt ex permissione, quae tametsi in {3}ultimo loco sunt, usque tamen ob innumerabilia arcana inibi, homo 
se confundit cum perspicit illa ex volutionibus rerum in natura, et ex apparentiis, et magis cum ex fallaciis sensuum; sed arcana permissionis respective pauca sunt ad arcana graduum superiorum, quae 
sunt quae fiunt ex venia, ex beneplacito, et ex voluntate. @1 id enim cum recipitur ab homine, placet, est enim tunc in alio, in quo spectatur, Divinum illud est bonum amoris et fidei a Domino in Dominum$ @2
