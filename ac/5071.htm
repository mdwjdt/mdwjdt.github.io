<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5071节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5071.</strong>左边的之所以被称为“咒诅的人”，对他们的惩罚是“永火”，如以下经文所说：“王又要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去”，以及“这些人，要往永刑里去”，是因为他们转离良善与真理，转向邪恶与虚假。就圣言的内义而言，“咒诅”表示一种转离（<a href="245.htm">245</a>，<a href="379.htm">379</a>，<a href="1423.htm">1423</a>，<a href="3530.htm">3530</a>，<a href="3584.htm">3584</a>节）。他们要离开所进入的“永火”不是属世之火，也不是良心的折磨，而是对邪恶的贪欲。因为在人里面，像这样的贪欲就是属灵之火；这火在他活在肉身期间就吞噬他，在来世则折磨他。由于这些火在他们里面燃烧，所以地狱居民利用可怕的手段彼此折磨。<br />显然，“永火”不是属世之火；它之所以不是良心的折磨，是因为凡陷入邪恶的人都没有良心，那些活在肉身期间就没有良心的人在来世也不可能有任何良心。不过，它之所以是一种贪欲，是因为人里面的一切生命之火皆由他的爱所点燃；天堂之火由对良善与真理的爱点燃，地狱之火由对邪恶与虚假的爱点燃；或也可说，天堂之火由对主之爱和对邻之爱点燃，地狱之火由自我之爱和尘世之爱点燃。若注意这个问题，谁都能看出，人里面所燃烧的一切火或热都是被他的爱所点燃的。这也解释了为何爱被称为属灵之热，“火”与“热”在圣言中并没有其它含义（<a href="934.htm">934</a>e，<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1527.htm">1527</a>，<a href="1528.htm">1528</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>，<a href="4906.htm">4906</a>节）。恶人里面的生命之火具有这样的性质：当他们感觉到非常强的欲望时，也有一种火在他们里面燃烧，这火激起他们折磨他人的强烈而又狂怒的渴望。但善人里面的生命之火具有这样的性质：当更高层次的情感存在于他们里面时，一种火也在他们里面燃烧。但这火却激起他们向别人行善的一种爱和热情。</p>

That they on the left hand are called "cursed," and their punishment "eternal fire," as where it is said: </p>
<p>	Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from Me ye cursed into the eternal 
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels; </p>
<p>and, 	These shall go away into eternal punishment; </p>
<p>is because they have averted themselves from good and truth, and have turned to evil and falsity. A 
"curse," in the internal sense of the Word, signifies a turning away (n. 245, 379, 1423, 3530, 3584). The "eternal fire" into which they must depart is not natural fire, nor is it torment of conscience, 
but is concupiscence of evil; for the concupiscences in man are spiritual fires which consume him in the life of the body, and torment him in the other life. By these fires the infernals torture one 
another in direful ways. [2] That "eternal fire" is not natural fire, is evident. That it is not torment of conscience, is because all who are in evil have no conscience, and they who have had none 
in the life of the body cannot have any in the other life. But that it is concupiscence is because all vital fire is from the loves in man-heavenly fire from the love of good and truth, and infernal 
fire from the love of evil and falsity-or what is the same, heavenly fire is from love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor, and infernal fire is from the love of self and the love of the world. 
That all the fire or heat within man is from this source, anyone may know if he pays attention to the matter. It is for this reason also that love is called spiritual heat, and that by "fire" and "heat" 
in the Word nothing else is signified (n. 934e, 1297, 1527, 1528, 1861, 2446, 4906). The vital fire in the evil is such that when they are in the vehemence of their concupiscences, they are also in 
a kind of fire, from which they are in the ardor and fury of tormenting others; but the vital fire in the good is such that when in a high degree of affection, they also are in a kind of fire, but from 
it they are in the love and zeal of benefiting others. 	 	GENESIS 40 </p>
<p>	1. And it came to pass after these words that they sinned, the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker, to their lord the 
king of Egypt. 	2. And Pharaoh was wroth over his two court ministers, over the prince of the butlers, and over the prince of the bakers. 	3. And he put them into the custody of the house of the prince 
of the guards, unto the prison house, the place where Joseph was bound. 	4. And the prince of the guards set Joseph over them, and he ministered to them; and they were for days in custody. 	5. 
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison house. 	6. 
And Joseph came unto them in the morning, and saw them, and behold they were troubled. 	7. And he asked Pharaoh's court ministers that were with him in the custody of his lord's house, saying, 
Wherefore are your faces evil today? 	8. And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it 
me, I pray. 	9. And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream behold a vine was before me. 	10. And in the vine were three shoots, and it was as though it budded, 
its blossom went up, and the clusters thereof ripened grapes. 	11. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup upon the palm of 
Pharaoh. 	12. And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it; the three shoots three days are these. 	13. In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and shall bring thee back upon 
thy station, and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 	14. But remember me with thee when it is well with thee, and do mercy I pray with me, 
and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 	15. For being carried off by theft I was carried away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they 
should put me into the pit. 	16. And the prince of the bakers saw that he had interpreted good, and he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold three baskets with holes in them upon my 
head. 	17. And in the uppermost basket there was of all food for Pharaoh, the work of the baker; and the birds did eat them out of the basket from upon my head. 	18. And Joseph answered and said, This 
is the interpretation thereof. The three baskets three days are these. 	19. In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift off thy head from upon thee, and shall hang thee upon wood; and the birds shall eat 
thy flesh from upon thee. 	20. And it came to pass on the third day, on Pharaoh's birthday, and he made a feast unto all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the prince of the butlers and the 
head of the prince of the bakers in the midst of his servants. 	21. And he brought back the prince of the butlers upon his butlership; and he gave the cup upon Pharaoh's palm. 	22. And he hanged the 
prince of the bakers; as Joseph interpreted to them. 	23. And the prince of the butlers did not remember Joseph, and he forgot him. </p>

The reason why the expression 'cursed' is used of those on the left and why their punishment is called 'eternal fire' in the following statements -'Then He will also say to those on the left, Depart 
from Me, O cursed ones, into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels' and 'these will go away into eternal punishment' - is that they have turned away from good and truth and have turned towards 
evil and falsity. 'Cursing' in the internal sense of the Word means a turning away, <a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="379.htm">379</a>, <a href="1427.htm">1427</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3584.htm">3584</a>. The eternal fire into which they were to depart is not material fire, nor is it a 
tormented conscience, but a craving for evil. For cravings like this in a person are spiritual fires which consume him during the life of the body and torment him in the next life. Because of these fires 
burning within them, the inhabitants of hell use dreadful methods to torture one another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Eternal fire is clearly not material fire; and the reason it is not a tormented conscience is that 
none who are governed by evil have any conscience; and those who have had no conscience during their lifetime cannot have any in the next life. But the reason eternal fire is a craving is that the entire 
fire of life in a person is fuelled by his loves, a heavenly fire by the love of what is good and true, a hellish fire by the love of what is evil and false. Or what amounts to the same, a heavenly 
fire is fuelled by love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, and a hellish fire by self-love and love of the world. Anyone can see, if he stops to think, that all the fire or heat burning within 
a person is fuelled by his loves. This also explains why love is called spiritual heat and why in the Word fire and heat have no other meaning, <a href="934.htm">934</a> (end), <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>,<a href="1527.htm">1527</a>, <a href="1528.htm">1528</a>, <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, <a href="2446.htm">2446</a>, <a href="4906.htm">4906</a>. The fire 
of life in the evil is also such that when they feel very strong cravings, a kind of fire is also burning in them, which inflames them with an intense and furious desire to torment others. But the 
fire of life in the good is such that when a higher level of affection exists with them, a kind of fire is alight in them too. But this fire inflames them with a loving and zealous desire to do good to 
others. </p>

Quod illi qui a sinistris, dicantur `maledicti', (c)ac poena eorum ignis aeternus, `Tunc dicet etiam iis qui a sinistris, Discedite a Me maledicti in ignem aeternum paratum diabolo et angelis ejus; 
et abibunt hi in poenam aeternam", est quia se averterunt a bono et vero, et converterunt ad malum et falsum; </p>
<p>`maledictio' in sensu (t)Verbi interno' significat aversionem, n. 245, 379, 1423, 3530, 
3584. `Ignis aeternus' in quem discederent, non est ignis elementaris, nec est conscientiae cruciatus, sed est concupiscentia mali; concupiscentiae enim apud hominem sunt ignes spirituales qui 
illum in vita corporis consumunt, et in altera vita cruciant; ex illis ignibus infernales se mutuo diris modis torquent. Quod ignis aeternus non sit ignis 2 elementaris, constare potest; quod non sit 
conscientiae cruciatus, est quia omnes qui in malo sunt, nullam conscientiam habent, et qui nullam in vita corporis habuerant, nec ullam habere possunt in altera vita; at quod concupiscentia sit, 
est quia omne igneum vitale est ab amoribus apud hominem, igneum caeleste ab amore boni et veri, et igneum infernale ab amore mali et falsi, seu quod idem, igneum caeleste est ab amore in Dominum 
et amore erga proximum, et igneum infernale ab amore sui et amore mundi; quod omnis ignis seu calor intus in homine sit inde, quisque scire potest si attendat {1}: </p>

<p>1.  Et fuit 
post verba haec peccaverunt pincerna regis Aegypti, et pistor, domino suo regi Aegypti. 2.  Et succensuit Pharaoh super binos ministros aulicos suos, super principem pincernarum, et super principem 
pistorum. 3.  Et dedit illos in custodiam domus principis satellitum ad domum carceris, locum ubi Joseph vinctus. 4.  Et praefecit princeps satellitum Josephum illis, et ministrabat illis, et fuerunt 
diebus in custodia. 5.  Et somniarunt somnium bini illi, quisque somnium suum, in nocte una, quisque secundum interpretationem somnii sui, pincerna et pistor, qui regi Aegypti, qui vincti in domo 
carceris. 6.  Et venit ad illos Joseph in matutino, et vidit illos, et ecce illi perturbati. 7.  Et interrogabat ministros aulicos Pharaonis, qui cum eo in custodia domus domini sui, dicendo, 
Quare facies vestrae malae hodie? 8.  Et dixerunt ad eum, Somnium somniavimus, et interpretator nullus illi; et dixit ad illos Joseph, Nonne DEO interpretationes? narrate quaeso mihi. 9.  Et narravit 
princeps pincernarum somnium suum Josepho, et dixit ei, In somnio meo, et ecce vitis coram me. 10.  Et in vite tres {1}propagines, et illa sicut germinans, ascendit flos illius, et maturuerunt 
botri illius, uvas. @1 Sch has palmites$ 11.  Et scyphus Pharaonis in manu mea, et accepi uvas, et expressi  illas ad scyphum Pharaonis, et dedi scyphum super volam Pharaonis. 12.  Et dixit illi 
Josephi, Haec interpretatio illius; tres propagines tres dies illae. 13.  In adhuc tribus diebus extollet Pharaoh caput tuum, et reducet te super stationem tuam, et dabis scyphum Pharaonis in manum illius, 
secundum morem priorem, quo fuisti pincerna illius. 14.  Verum memento mei tecum, quando bene est tibi, et facias quaeso mecum misericordiam, et meminisse facias mei ad Pharaonem, et educas 
me e domo hac. 15.  Quia furto auferendo ablatus sum e terra Hebraeorum, et etiam hic non feci quicquam quod posuerint me in fovea. 16.  Et vidit princeps pistorum, quod bonum interpretatus et dixit ad 
Josephum, Etiam ego in somnio meo, et ecce tria {1}canistra perforata super capite meo. @1 Sch has corbes similagineorum (panum)$ 17.  Et in canistro supremo ab omni cibo Pharaonis, opere 
pistoris, et avis edens ea e canistro desuper capite meo. 18.  Et respondit Joseph, et dixit, Haec interpretatio ejus, tria canistra tres dies illa. 19.  In adhuc tribus diebus, extollet Pharaoh caput
