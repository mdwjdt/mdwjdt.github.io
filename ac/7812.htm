<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7812节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7812.</strong>除了刚才所提到的灵人外，还有些灌输反面信念的灵人。他们是那些活在世上时因邪恶而从其他人的社群那里被逐出的人。当靠近时，他们看上去就像一团飞火，这火滑落到脸旁边。他们把自己安置在下面，在一个人的下半身，从那里把他们所说的话引向上半身。他们所说的话，与教导灵在天使指引下所说的话相反；也就是说，他们声称此人无需照这种教导生活，而应随从自己的倾向和欲望等等。他们通常在第一种灵人离开后随即到来。但木星人知道这些灵人是谁，是何性质；所以木星人并不理会他们。尽管如此，他们仍以这种方式学习何为邪恶，从而学习何为良善。因为人通过邪恶学习何为良善，事实上，人从良善的对立面就能知道良善的性质。对一个事物的一切觉知都通过将该事物与以各种方式、各种程度和它相反的事物联系起来，并反思不同之处而到来。</p>

Besides the spirits of whom mention has now been made, there are also spirits who infuse contrary persuasions; being those who while they lived in the world were banished from the society of others, 
because they were evil. When they approach, there appears as it were a flying flame which glides down near the face; they place themselves beneath, at the man's hinder parts, and speak from there toward 
the parts above. They speak things contrary to those which the instructing spirit from the angels has said; namely, that they need not live according to the instruction, but at their own good will 
and pleasure, and the like. They usually come immediately after the former spirits have departed. But the men on that earth know who and of what quality these spirits are, and therefore they pay no regard 
to them. Nevertheless they thus learn what evil is, and so what good is; for by evil is learned what is good, the quality of good being known from its opposite. All perception of a thing is according 
to reflection bearing on the distinctions that come from contraries in various ways and in various degrees. </p>

In addition to the spirits who have just been mentioned there are also spirits who urge things that are contrary. They are those who when they lived in the world were banished from association with others 
because they were evil. When they arrive they look like fire moving through the air, which comes down close to one's face. They place themselves low down at a person's hinder parts, and from there 
they direct what they say to the upper parts. They make statements that contradict things said by an instructor spirit under the direction of the angels; that is, they declare that the person does 
not need to conduct his life in accordance with that instruction, but to follow his own inclination and desire, and similar ideas. Usually these spirits arrive immediately after the first ones have departed. 
But people there know exactly who these spirits are and what they are like, and therefore do not worry about them. All the same, they learn in this way what evil is, and so what good is; for 
one learns from evil what good is, indeed one knows the nature of good from its opposite, to be exact. Every perception of something is arrived at by relating it to, and reflecting on its differences 
from, things that are contrary to it in varying ways and degrees.  </p>

</p><b>7812.</b>
Praeter spiritus de quibus nunc memoratum est dantur etiam spiritus qui contraria suadent; suntque illi qui, dum vixerunt in mundo, e societate aliorum exterminati sunt, quia mali; quando alluunt, apparet 
sicut ignis volans, qui prope faciem delabitur; se locant {2}infra ad posteriora hominis, et inde {3}versus superiora loquantur; loquuntur contraria illis quae spiritus instructor ab angelis {4}dixit, 
quod nempe non vivendum {5}secundum instructionem, sed ex arbitrio et in licentia, et similia; ut plurimum veniunt statim postquam abiverunt priores spiritus; {6}ast homines ibi sciunt quinam 
et quales spiritus illi sunt, et ideo nihil curant illos; sed usque ita discunt quid malum, et sic quid bonum; nam per malum discitur quid bonum, quippe quale boni ex suo contrario {7}noscitur; omnis 
perceptio rei est secundum reflexionem relativam ad discrimina ex contrariis vario modo et vario gradu. 	@1 sed$ 	@2 inferius$ 	@3 loquuntur versus superiora; et$ 	@4 dixerat$ 	@5 sit secundum illorum$ 	@6 
sed quia sciunt ibi homines$ 	@7 d noscitur, i, et consequenter ex ea relatione ad illud noscitur; nam$ </p>
