<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1983节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1983.</strong>恶灵有一种强烈的欲望，急切地想趁人睡着时骚扰并攻击他。但那时人被主特别保护起来，因为爱是不睡觉的。骚扰的灵人受到惨重的惩罚。我经常听说他们受惩罚，比我能重复提及的次数还要多。这些惩罚包括撕裂，如前面所描述的（<a href="829.htm">829</a>，<a href="957.htm">957</a>，<a href="959.htm">959</a>节）。撕裂的惩罚在左脚后跟下面执行，有时会连续持续数小时。塞壬内在是女巫，尤其会在夜里伺机等待，然后试图慢慢进入人的内在思维和情感。但她们常常被主通过天使驱赶，最后被最为严厉的惩罚吓退。她们也在夜间与别人说话，当时，她们演得极象我，并惟妙惟肖地模仿我说话，以至于谁也看不出有什么分别，并在此过程中注入污秽的想法，暗示虚假的观念。<br />有一次，我睡得特别香甜，并且只有柔和的睡眠。当我醒来时，一些善灵开始指责我如此残暴地侵扰他们，以致他们以为自己在地狱中，他们把责任推到我身上。我回答他们说，我对此事一无所知，而是睡得很熟，所以决不可能去侵扰他们。他们闻言目瞪口呆，最后意识到这是那些塞壬耍弄的把戏。后来，类似事件也向我说明了，以便我能了解那帮塞壬的性质。<br />这些塞壬主要是女性。她们在世时一生都在研究如何通过内在诡计吸引男性同伴，通过外在诱惑渗透进入，尽可能地俘获他们的低层心智，进入每个人的情感和快乐。不过，这一切却带有邪恶的动机，也就是以操控为目的。因此，她们在来世具有这样的性质：她们似乎能凭自己做任何事。她们吸取并发明各种艺术，而且吸收这些艺术，就象海绵吸水那样容易，无论是污秽的还是洁净的。所以，她们也吸取并实践神圣之物和亵渎之物，但却以操控为目的，如前所述。我蒙允许觉察她们的内层，看看她们因被通奸和仇恨所玷污而何等污秽。我也蒙允许觉察她们的气场何等强大。这些塞壬会迫使自己的内层思维和感觉进入一种说服状态，以便这些思维和感觉能与其朝向她们所意图之事的外层思维和感觉密切配合。塞壬们就这样迫使并牵引灵人照她们所想的去思考。<br />她们当中没有明显的推理，然而，她们却运用大量推理，这些推理通过使自己适应属世倾向而渗透到这个人的邪恶情感中。她们以这种方式进入别人的低层心智，然后引领他们，并通过说服要么压垮他们，要么迷住他们。她们只学习如何摧毁良知，并且一旦摧毁，就占据人的内层，甚至迷住他们，尽管这些人没有意识到它。如今，外在的痴迷不象以前那样被允许，但此类灵人所引发的内在痴迷仍会发生。没有良知的人会以这种方式被迷住。他们思维内层的疯狂方式与此无异，只是被外在的得体和为了个人荣誉、名利而假装的诚实隐藏和掩盖。这种人若留意自己的想法，甚至自己就能知道这一点。</p>

Evil spirits most vehemently desire and burn to infest and attack man when he is sleeping, but man is then especially guarded by the Lord, for love does not sleep. The spirits who infest are miserably 
punished. I have heard their punishments oftener than I can tell; they consist in rendings (spoken of, n. 829, 957, 959), under the heel of the left foot, and this sometimes for hours together. Sirens, 
who are interior enchantresses, are they who are especially insidious in the night time, and then try to insinuate themselves into a man's interior thoughts and affections, but are as often driven 
away by the Lord by means of angels, and are at last deterred by the severest punishments. They have also spoken with others in the night time, exactly as if they spoke from me, and as it were with my 
speech, so like that it could not be distinguished, pouring in filthy things, and persuading false ones.  [2] I was once in a very sweet sleep, in which I had nothing but soft repose. When I awoke, 
some good spirits began to chide me for having (as they said) infested them so atrociously that they supposed they were in hell-throwing the blame upon me. I answered them that I knew nothing whatever 
about the matter, but had been sleeping most quietly, so that by no possibility could I have been troublesome to them. Astonished at this, they at last had a perception that it had been done by the 
magic arts of sirens. The like was also shown afterwards, in order that I might know the quality of the crew of sirens.  [3] They are chiefly of the female sex, who in the life of the body had studied 
to allure male companions to themselves by interior artifices; insinuating themselves by means of outward things, captivating their lower minds in every possible way, entering into each one's affections 
and delights, but with an evil end, especially that of exercising command. Hence they have such a nature in the other life that they seem able of themselves to do all things, imbibing and inventing 
various arts, which they absorb as easily as sponges do waters, whether clean or filthy. So do they imbibe and put into act things profane as well as holy, with the end, as before said, of exercising 
command. It has been granted me to perceive their interiors, and to see how foul they are, being defiled by adulteries and hatreds. It has also been granted me to perceive how powerful in its effects 
is their sphere. They reduce their interiors into a state of persuasion, in order that these may conspire with their exteriors toward such things as they intend. They thus compel and violently draw 
spirits to think exactly as they do.  [4] No reasonings appear in connection with them, but they make use of a kind of simultaneous rush of reasonings that are breathed into the person's evil affections 
and so they work by applying themselves to the natural inclinations, and thereby they get into the lower minds of others, whom they lead on,  and by persuasion either overwhelm or captivate them. 
They study nothing more than to destroy the conscience, and when it is destroyed they get possession of men's interiors, and even obsess the men, although these are ignorant of it. At this day there 
are not as formerly external obsessions, but there are internal ones, by spirits of this class. They who have no conscience have become obsessed in this way. The interiors of their thoughts are insane 
in a manner not unlike this, but are concealed and veiled over by an external decorum and a pretended honorableness, for the sake of their own honor, gain, and reputation. And this such men may know, 
if they pay attention to their thoughts. </p>

Evil spirits have a strong and burning desire to molest and attack man when he is asleep, but at that time man is especially protected by the Lord, for love does not sleep. Spirits who molest are punished 
piteously. I have heard their punishments more often than I can repeat. These involve being torn apart, as described in <a href="829.htm">829</a>, <a href="957.htm">957</a>, <a href="959.htm">959</a>, which is carried out below the heel of the left foot, lasting 
sometimes for hours on end. Sirens, who inwardly are witches, are those who especially lie in wait in the night, and then try to worm their way into a person's inward thoughts and affections. But as 
often as they try to do so they are foiled by angels from the Lord and at length are deterred by means of very drastic punishments. 'These sirens have also spoken to others in the night, when they have 
impersonated me so perfectly and imitated my speaking so accurately that no one could tell the difference, and in so doing have poured in filthy thoughts and suggested ideas that were false. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
I was once sleeping very soundly, in an altogether sweet repose. When I awoke certain good spirits began to accuse me of having molested them, so violently, they said, that they thought they had been 
in hell; they put the blame on me. I answered them that I knew nothing whatever about the matter, but that I had been fast asleep and therefore could not possibly have been the one to molest them. At 
this they were dumbfounded and at length realized that those sirens had been up to their tricks. Something similar was also demonstrated to me after that so that I might know what that band of sirens 
is like. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These sirens are mainly females, who during their lifetime have studied how to attract male companions to themselves by interior devices - by worming their way in through external allurements, 
by captivating the baser mental instincts in all sorts of ways, by penetrating into each one's affections and delights, but with an evil motive, namely that of manipulating. Their nature is 
such in the next life therefore that they seem to be able of themselves to do anything. They take in from others and think up for themselves different devices which they absorb with ease like sponges 
soaking up water, filthy or clean alike. They accordingly soak up and practice what is profane as well as what is holy with the intent, as stated, of manipulating. I have been allowed to perceive how 
foul they are inwardly, polluted by adultery and hatred. I have also been given to perceive how overpowering their sphere is. These sirens force their own interior thought and feelings into a state of 
persuasion, so that these may go hand in glove with their exterior thought and feelings towards the things they intend. In this way sirens compel and lead spirits to think as they themselves do. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
No reasonings are in evidence among them, and yet they employ a whole mass of reasonings that are breathed into people's evil affections by applying themselves to those persons' natural instincts. 
In this way they gain entry into the baser parts of the minds of others whom they lead on and by persuasion either overwhelm or captivate. There is nothing they study more than how to destroy conscience, 
and when they have destroyed it gain possession of people interiorly and even obsess them, though the individual is not conscious of it. Nowadays external obsession is not allowed as it once was 
in former times, but internal possession by spirits such as these does take place. People who are devoid of conscience are obsessed in this way. The interior aspects of their thought are insane in a very 
similar way, but those aspects are concealed by and covered with an outward propriety and presence of honesty displayed for the sake of personal position, wealth, and reputation. This they can even 
recognize for themselves if they pay any attention to what they think. </p>

Spiritus mali maximopere cupiunt et flagrant infestare et aggredi hominem cum dormit, sed tunc imprimis custoditur homo a Domino; nam amor non dormit: spiritus qui infestant, miserabiliter puniuntur; 
audivi saepius quam ut narrari possit, punitiones eorum, quae sunt discerptiones, de quibus n. 829, 957, 959, sub calcaneo pedis sinistri, et hoc quandoque per horaria tempora.  Sirenes quae sunt praestigiatrices 
interiores, sunt quae tempore noctis imprimis insidiantur, et in cogitationes et affectiones interiores homini se infundere tunc tentant, sed toties arcentur per angelos a Domino, et per 
gravissimas punitiones tandem absterrentur.  Locutae etiam cum aliis tempore noctis, prorsus sicut a me, mea quasi loquela, tam simili ut non internosceretur {1} ingerendo spurca et persuadendo falsa; 
[2] semel in suavissimo somno fui, in quo nihil praeter dulcem quietem habui; cum expergefactus, quidam boni spiritus coeperunt me increpare quod eos infestaverim, ita atrociter, sicut dicebant, ut 
putaverint se fuisse in inferno, in me rejiciendo culpam, quibus respondi, quod nihil quicquam de ea re scirem, sed quod quietissime dormiverim, si ut eis nullatenus potuissem infestus esse, quo obstupefacti 
apperceperunt tandem hoc praestigiis sirenum factum esse; simile etiam {2} ostensum postea ex causa ut scirem qualis sirenum turba sit; [3] sunt praecipue ex sexu feminino, quae in vita corporis 
per interiores astutias allicere `ad se studuerunt' socios, per externa se insinuando, captando animos quocumque modo, intrando in cujusvis affectiones et jucunda, sed fine malo, cumprimis imperandi; 
inde iis talis natura in altera vita quod videantur {3} ex se omnia posse, hauriendo et excogitando varias artes quas arripiunt tam facile, sicut spongiae aquas aeque sordidas ac limpidas; ita illae 
tam profana quam sancta, quae insorbent et in actum mittunt fine, ut dictum, imperandi: datum interiora earum percipere, quam foeda sint, adulteriis et odiis conspurcata; tum etiam datum percipere 
quam efficax earum sphaera sit; interiora sua in statum persuasionis redigunt, ut in talia quae intendunt, conspirent interiora cum exterioribus, ita adigunt et violenter adducunt spiritus ad cogitandum 
prorsus sicut illae; [4] ratiocinia apud eas nulla patent, sed est simultaneum quoddam ratiociniorum malis affectionibus inspiratorum, ita operans, cum applicatione ad genios, et immissio sic in aliorum 
animos, quos inducunt et persuasione aut obruunt aut captant: nihil plus student quam conscientiam destruere, qua destructa interiora hominum possident, immo obsident, tametsi homo hoc ignorat; 
hodie non dantur obsessiones externae sicut olim, sed internae a talibus; qui nulla conscientia sunt, illi ita obsessi sunt, cogitationum eorum interiora non absimiliter insaniunt, sed celantur et obvelantur 
externo decora, et simulatorio honesto, ex causa sui honoris, lucri, famae; hoc iis, si ad cogitationes suas attendunt, etiam notum esse potest. 					  FINIS {4}. 	@1 internosceatur.$ 	@2 quoque.$ 	@3
