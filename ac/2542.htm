<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2542节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2542.</strong>“在他们耳边将所有这些事都说了”表对由此得出的确认之事的劝诫，直到他们听从。这从内义上的整个思路，以及“耳朵”的含义清楚可知。从整个思路可知：有很多具有确认性质的事可对理性所承认的任何事给予支持；事实上，理性完全是因为这些确认性质的事才去承认的。所以，当理性事物变得顺从时，就会对所确认的事作出劝诫；因为这些具有确认性质的事永远都是蓄势待发，可以说正在起来。从“耳”的含义可知：就圣言的内义而言，“耳”表听从，因为听见与听从之间存在对应关系。而且，这种对应关系就潜在于“听”，尤其“倾听”这个词中；它起源于来世，在那里，那些听从并愿意之人属于耳朵的区域，事实上就对应于“听”这个功能本身，这是一个尚不为人知的奥秘。蒙主怜悯，这些事等到下文论述对应关系时会看得更清楚。“耳”具有这样的含义从圣言中的很多经文明显看出来。我们在此仅从以赛亚书引用以下经文：<br />你去使这人民心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，将他们的眼涂抹掉，免得他们用眼看见，用耳听见，心里明白。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.10.htm">6:10</a>）<br />此处“用眼看见”表理解，“用耳听见”表用情感去觉察，因而表听从。主说下面这句话也没有别的意思：<br />有耳可听的，就应当听！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.15.htm">11:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.9.htm">13:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">43</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.8.htm">8:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.35.htm">14:35</a>）</p>

And spoke all these words in their ears. That this signifies an exhortation to the things thence derived that confirm, even until they should become obedient, is evident from the series in the internal 
sense, as well as from the signification of "ears." From the series: There are many confirmatory things that support whatever the rational acknowledges; for it is precisely from these confirmatory 
things that its acknowledgment comes; and therefore it is that when rational things are being reduced to obedience exhortation is made to the things that confirm; for these are ever pressing in, and as 
it were rising up. From the signification of "ears:" In the internal sense of the Word "ears" signify obedience, by reason of the correspondence between hearing and obeying; which correspondence is 
moreover latent in the very word "hear," and still more in "hearken;" the origin of which correspondence is from the other life, where they who are willing and obedient belong to the province of the ear, 
and indeed correspond to the hearing itself; which is an arcanum not yet known. But these things will become more clearly manifest when in what follows, of the Lord's Divine mercy, correspondence 
will be treated of. That "ears" have this signification is evident from many passages in the Word. For the present we may adduce a single passage from Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Make the heart of this people fat, 
and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest peradventure they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and their heart should understand (Isa. 6:10). Here to "see with the eyes" is to 
understand; and to "hear with the ears" is to perceive with affection, consequently to obey. And nothing else is signified where the Lord says, "He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear" (Matt. 11:15, 
13:9, 43; Luke 8:8; 14:35). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2542</b></p><p><b>2542.</b>
'And spoke all these words in their ears' means an exhortation made to confirmations from this source, even until they should become obedient. This becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal 
sense, and also from the meaning of 'ears'. </p>
<p>From the train of thought: There are many matters of a confirmatory nature that lend support to whatever the rational acknowledges; indeed its acknowledgement 
is due entirely to those confirmatory matters. This is why, when rational concepts are brought into a condition of obedience, an exhortation is made to things that confirm, for these are for 
ever at hand and so to speak rising up. </p>
<p>From the meaning of 'ears': 'Ears' in the internal sense of the Word means obedience because of the correspondence that exists between hearing and obeying. 
Furthermore, this correspondence lies hidden within the very word 'hearing', more so in 'hearkening'. This correspondence has its origin in the next life where those who are obedient and willing belong 
to the province of the ear. Indeed they correspond to the faculty of hearing itself, an arcanum unknown as yet. But these matters will be seen more easily when correspondence will be dealt with in 
the Lord's Divine mercy later on. The fact that 'ears' has this meaning becomes clear from very many places in the Word; but for the time being let only the following in Isaiah be quoted, </p>
<blockquote>
Make the 
heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and plaster over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and their heart understands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'seeing with the eyes' 
means understanding, and 'hearing with the ears' means perceiving with affection and therefore means obeying. And nothing else is meant when the Lord says, </p>
<blockquote>
He who has an ear to hear, let him hear. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:15;%2013:9,%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:15; 13:9, 43</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:8;%2014:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:8; 14:35</a>.

</p><b>2542.</b>
`Et locutus est omnia verba illa in auribus eorum': quod significet adhortationem ad confirmantia inde, usque ut oboedirent, constare potest a serie rerum in sensu interno, tum a significatione `aurium'; 
ex serie rerum, sunt plura confirmantia, quae accedunt ad quodcumque quod rationale agnoscit, aliunde enim non agnoscit quam ex confirmantibus, inde est cum rationalia ad oboedientiam rediguntur, 
ad confirmantia fit exhortatio, ea enim semper usque instant et quasi exsurgunt: ex significatione `aurium,' aures in (t)sensu interno Verbi significant oboedientiam, ex causa etiam correspondentiae 
quae est inter audire et oboedire, quae (t)quoque correspondentia latet in ipsa voce `audire,' et magis in `auscultare,' cujus correspondentiae origo est ex altera vita, ubi qui oboedientes sunt (c)et 
obtemperantes, ad auris provinciam pertinent, immo ipsi auditui correspondent, quod est arcanum nondum notum; sed haec melius patebunt ubi de correspondentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus 
agetur: quod `aures' illa significent, ex pluribus locis in Verbo constare potest; pro tempore licet modo afferre quod apud Esaiam, 	Impingua cor populi hujus, et aures ejus aggrava, et	oculos 
ejus obline, ne forte videat oculis suis, et auribus suis audiat, et cor ejus intelligat, vi 10; </p>
<p>ibi `videre oculis' est intelligere, et `audire auribus' est percipere affectione, proinde oboedire: 
ac ubi Dominus dicit, 	Qui habet aurem ad audiendum, audiat, Matth. xi 15; xiii, 43; Luc. viii 8; xiv 35; </p>
<p>non aliud significatur. </p>
