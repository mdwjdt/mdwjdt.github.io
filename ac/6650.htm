Verses 8-14. And there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are many and numerous more than we. Come, let us use prudence 
with it;* peradventure it will be multiplied, and it will be that wars will happen, and it will also join itself to our enemies, and fight against us, and go up out of the land. And they set over 
it princes of tributes, in order to afflict it with burdens. And it built cities of store-houses for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses. And as they afflicted it, so it was multiplied, and so it was increased. 
And they were moved with loathing because of the sons of Israel. And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with cruelty; and they rendered their life bitter with grievous service, in clay, 
and in bricks, and in all service in the field, with all their service wherein they made them serve with cruelty. "And there arose a new king over Egypt," signifies separated memory-knowledges which 
are opposed to the truths of the church; "who knew not Joseph," signifies which were completely alienated from the internal; "and he said unto his people," signifies subordinate memory-knowledges; "Behold, 
the people of the sons of Israel are many and numerous more than we," signifies that the truths of the church prevail over alienated memory-knowledges; "come, let us use prudence with it," signifies 
cunning; "peradventure it will be multiplied, and it will be that wars will happen," signifies prevalence if it grows; "and it will also join itself to our enemies and fight against us," signifies 
that thus their companions who would occasion evil would be strengthened; "and go up out of the land," signifies that thus the church will be set up anew; "and they set over it princes of tributes," 
signifies falsities that would compel to serve; "to afflict it with burdens," signifies a growing worse through servitudes; "and it built cities of storehouses for Pharaoh," signifies doctrines from 
falsified truths in the natural where alienated memory-knowledges are; "Pithom and Raamses," signifies their quality; "and as they afflicted it, so it was multiplied," signifies that truths grew according 
to the infestations; "and so it increased," signifies that they were strengthened; "and they were moved with loathing because of the sons of Israel," signifies greater aversion; "and the Egyptians 
made the sons of Israel to serve," signifies an intention to subjugate; "with cruelty," signifies unmercifulness; "and they rendered their life bitter with grievous service," signifies until the intention 
to subjugate became troublesome; "in clay, and in bricks," signifies by reason of the evils which they contrived, and the falsities which they devised; "and in all service in the field," signifies 
the intention to subjugate directed against the things of the church; "with all their service wherein they made them serve with cruelty," signifies the intention to subjugate in many ways by reason 
of unmercifulness. * The singular number is here used in both the Hebrew and the Latin. The same peculiar form is found also in the English Bible (Gen. 11:6),"Behold the people is one." </p>

Verses 8-14 And a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are many and numerous, more than ourselves. Come, let us 
use prudence with them; perhaps they will multiply, and it will be when wars occur, that they also will join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and go up out of the land. And they set princes 
of tributes<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> over them, to afflict them with burdens. And they built cities of store-houses for Pharaoh - Pithom and Raamses. And according as they afflicted them, so they multiplied and so they 
grew; and they were filled with loathing because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigour. And they made their life bitter with hard service, in clay 
and in bricks, and in all [manner of] service in the field, with all their [other] service in which they made them serve with rigour. </p>
<p>'And a new king arose over Egypt' means separated factual knowledge, 
which is opposed to the Church's truths. 'Who did not know Joseph' means which is completely alienated from the internal. 'And he said to his people' means subordinated factual knowledge. 'Behold, 
the people of the children of Israel are many and numerous, more than ourselves' means that the Church's truths are prevailing over alienated factual knowledge. 'Come, let us use prudence with them' 
means guile. 'Perhaps they will multiply, and it will be when wars occur' means superior strength if they increase. 'That they also will join themselves to our enemies and fight against us' means that 
in that way allied forces who inflict harm will be made stronger. 'And go up out of the land' means that the Church will have thereby been established.' And they set princes of tributes over them' 
means falsities which would compel them to serve. 'To afflict them with burdens' means increasing distress caused by forms of hard service. 'And they built cities of store-houses for Pharaoh' means teachings 
composed of falsified truths in the natural where alienated factual knowledge resides. 'Pithom and Raamses' means the essential nature of those teachings. 'And according as they afflicted them, 
so they multiplied' means that in the measure that there were molestations, so the truths increased. 'And so they grew' means that they became strong. 'And they were filled with loathing because of 
the children of Israel' means greater aversion. 'And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve' means the aim to bring them under their control. 'With rigour means without showing any mercy. 
'And they made their life bitter with hard service' means to such an extent that the aim to bring them under their control became vexatious. 'In clay and in bricks' means on account of the evils which 
they devised and the falsities which they fabricated. 'And in all [manner of] service in the field' means the aim to bring things of the Church under their control. 'With all their [other] service in 
which they made them serve with rigour' means the aim to bring them under their control by the use of many methods, without showing them any mercy.

Vers. 8-14.  Et surrexit rex novus super Aegyptum, qui non novit Josephum.  Et dixit ad populum suum, Ecce populus filiorum Israelis multus et numerosus prae nobis.  Age, prudentia utamur illi; forte 
multiplicabitur, et erit quod obveniant bella, et adjunget se etiam ille ad inimicos nostros, et pugnabit in nos; et ascendet e terra.  Et posuerunt super illum principes tributorum, propter ut affligere 
illum oneribus; et aedificavit urbes promptuariorum Pharaoni, Pithom et Raamses.  Et quemadmodum afflixerunt illum, ita multiplicabatur, et ita augebatur; et fastidio affecti propter filios Israelis. 
 Et servire fecerunt Aegyptii filios Israelis in saevitia.  Et amaram reddiderunt vitam illorum servitute gravi, in luto et in lateribus, et in omni servitio in agro, cum omni servitio illorum, quo 
servire fecerunt illos in saevitia.  `Et surrexit rex novus super Aegyptum significat scientifica separata quae contra vera Ecclesiae: `qui non novit Josephum' significat quae prorsus abalienata ab 
interno: `et dixit ad populum suum' significat scientifica subordinata: `Ecce populus filiorum Israelis multus et numerosus prae nobis' significat quod invalescant vera Ecclesiae super scientificis abalienatis: 
`Age prudentia utamur illi' significat astum: `forte multiplicabitur, et erit quod obveniant bella' significat praevalentiam si crescit: `et adjunget se etiam ille ad inimicos nostros, et 
pugnabit in nos' significat quod sic corroborabuntur socii qui malum inferent: `et ascendet e terra significat quod sic instaurata erit Ecclesia: {1}`et posuerunt super illum principes tributorum' significat 
falsa quae adigerent ad serviendum: `propter ut affligere illum oneribus' significat ingravescentiam per servitutes: `et aedificavit urbes promptuariorum Pharaoni' significat doctrinas `ex' falsificatis 
veris in naturali ubi scientifica abalienata: `Pithom et Raamses' significat quale earum: `et quemadmodum afflixerant illum, ita multiplicabatur' significat quod secundum infestationes vera 
crescerent: `et ita augebatur' significat quod firmarentur: `et fastidio affecti propter filios Israelis' significat aversationem majorem: `et servire fecerunt Aegyptii filios Israelis' significat subjugationis 
intentionem: `in saevitia' significat immisericordiam: `et amaram reddiderunt vitam illorum servitute gravi' significat usque ut infesta fieret subjugationis intentio: `in luto et in lateribus' 
significat propter mala quae invenerunt, et falsa quae finxerunt: `et in omni servitio in agro' significat (m)subjugationis intentionem contra illa quae sunt Ecclesiae(n): `cum omni servitio illorum, 
{2}quo servire fecerunt illos in saevitia' significat subjugationis intentionem multis modis ex immisericordia. 	@1 Above this brief exposition of v 11 S wrote hieroglyphica$ 	@2 S had in saevitia, 
significat et quae aliunde et hoc cum immisericordia then he deleted in saevitia, and in place of significat...aliunde overwrote significat quae aliunde, quo servire fecerunt illos in saevitia$ </p>
