Verses 6-8. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. And Jacob feared exceedingly, and was distressed; 
and he halved the people that was with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps. And he said, If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then there will be a camp left 
for escape. "And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee," signifies that good flows in continually, so as to appropriate to itself; 
"and four hundred men with him," signifies its state now, that it may take the prior place; "and Jacob feared exceedingly, and was distressed," signifies the state when it is being changed; "and 
he halved the people that was with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps," signifies the preparation and disposal of the truths and goods in the natural to receive the good 
represented by Esau; "and he said, If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then there will be a camp left for escape," signifies according to every event. </p>

Verses 6-8 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother, to Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him. And Jacob was exceedingly afraid, and was 
distressed; and he split up the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps. And he said, If Esau comes towards one camp and smites it, the camp that is left will escape. 
'The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother, to Esau, and he also is coming to meet you' means that good flows in constantly so as to make [truths] its own. 'And four hundred 
men with him' means its state now, set to take up the first position. 'And Jacob was exceedingly afraid, and was distressed' means the state when it is being changed. 'And he split up the people who 
were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps' means the preparation and arrangement of truths and goods within the natural so as to receive the good represented by 'Esau'. 'And 
he said, If Esau comes towards one camp and smites it, the camp that is left will escape' means to meet every eventuality. </p>

Vers. 6-8.  Et reversi sunt nuntii ad Jacobum, dicendo, Venimus ad fratrem tuum, ad Esavum, et etiam vadit obviam tibi, et quadringenti viri cum eo.  Et timuit Jacob valde, et angustia fuit ei, et 
dimidiavit populum qui cum eo, et gregem, et armentum, et camelos, in duo castra.  Et dixit, Si venerit Esau ad castra una, et percusserit illa, et erunt castra relicta ad evasionem. `Reversi sunt 
nuntii ad Jacobum, dicendo, Venimus ad fratrem tuum ad Esavum, et etiam vadit obviam tibi' significat quod bonum continue influat ut appropriet sibi: `et quadringenti viri cum eo' significat statum ejus 
nunc ut priorem locum sumat: `et timuit Jacob valde, et angustia fuit ei' significat statum cum mutatur: `et dimidiavit populum qui cum eo, et gregem, et armentum, et camelos, in duo castra' 
significat praeparationem et dispositionem verorum et bonorum in naturali ad recipiendum bonum per `Esavum' repraesentatum: `et dixit, Si venerit Esau ad castra una, et percusserit illa, et erunt 
castra relicta ad evasionem' significat secundum omnem eventum. </p>
