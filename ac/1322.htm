<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1322节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1322.</strong>“使他们听不懂彼此的口音”表所有人都彼此不同，即一个反对另一个。这从这句话本身就能看出来。“听不懂彼此的口音”是指不承认别人说的话，在内义上是指不承认别人的教导，也就是他的教义，因为“口音（即嘴唇）”表教义，如第1节所说明的。他们只是口头上承认，其实内心不承认。若内心不承认，口头上的承认一文不值。这与来世恶灵的情形很相似，他们象善灵那样被划分为独立的各个社群。不过，他们因相似的幻想和恶欲结合起来，一同迫害真理和良善。所以，他们也有将其凝聚起来的共同爱好。然而，一旦这共同爱好不复存在，他们就会冲向彼此，以折磨一个或数个同伴为乐。世上存在这类教义和敬拜的地方也有类似情形。那里的人在承认教义和宗教仪式方面显得很团结、和谐，但将他们凝聚起来的共同爱好是自我崇拜。他们越能分享这种共同爱好，就越承认；而越不能或不希望分享它，就越分裂。原因如刚才所说，这些人中没有一个人拥有真理。每个人所拥有的，都是取代真理的虚假和取代良善的邪恶。因此，这就是“使他们听不懂彼此的口音”所表之义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1322.</strong> So that a man will be unable to understand the language of his companion means that they all clash, or oppose each other, as is clear from the words themselves. Being unable to understand the language of a companion is not acknowledging what another is saying. In an inner sense, it means not acknowledging what another teaches, or in other words, not acknowledging another's doctrine, since a language, [a lip, or speech] is doctrine, as shown above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1322/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1" target=_top>1</a>. They do acknowledge it with their mouth but not with their heart, and harmony of the mouth is nothing in the face of discord at heart.<br />The situation here resembles that of evil spirits in the next life. Like good spirits, they divide into separate communities, but what keeps them joined together are the ties formed by their having similar hallucinations and cravings. They act as one, then, in attacking what is true and good, and so they have something in common, something that binds them together. As soon as this common bond dissolves, however, each spirit assaults the next, and their pleasure then consists in torturing their companions one and all.<br />The case is the same with this type of doctrine and culture in the world. Adherents adopt a single doctrinal perspective and style of ritual compatibly enough, but the bond they share is self-worship. So far as they are able to participate in this common activity, they acknowledge [one another's points of view]; but so far as they cannot participate, nor hope to participate, they break apart. The reason, given just above, is that none of them knows any truth. Each takes falsity as truth and evil as goodness. This, now, is what it is for a man to be unable to understand the language of his companion. </p>

That they hear not a man the lip of his fellow. That this signifies that all are at variance, or that the one is against the other, is evident from the words themselves. "Not to hear one another's lip," 
is not to acknowledge what another says, and in the internal sense not to acknowledge what another teaches, that is, his doctrine, for "lip" is doctrine, as has been shown above (at verse 1). They 
acknowledge it indeed with the mouth, but not with the heart; but agreement with the mouth is nothing when there is disagreement of the heart. The case in this respect is the same as it is with evil 
spirits in the other life, who, in like manner as the good, are distinguished into societies, but are kept conjoined together by being attached by the like phantasies and cupidities, so that they act 
as a one in persecuting truths and goods. Thus there is a certain common interest by which they are held together; but as soon as this common bond is dissolved, they rush one upon another, and then their 
delight consists in tormenting their associate or associates. The case is similar with such doctrine and worship in this world; those in it acknowledge what pertains to doctrine and ritual harmoniously 
enough; but the common interest that holds them together is the worship of self; and so far as they can share in this common interest, they acknowledge; but so far as they cannot share or hope to 
share in it, they are disunited; for the reason given just above, that no one of this character possesses any truth, but everyone has falsity in the place of truth, and evil in the place of good. This 
therefore is what is signified by their "not hearing a man the lip of his fellow." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1322</b></p><p><b>1322.</b>
'So that they do not hear each man the lip of his companion' means that all were at variance with one another, that is, one man was opposed to the next. This becomes clear from the words themselves. 
'Not hearing a companion's lip' is not acknowledging what another says, and in the internal sense not acknowledging what another teaches, which is his doctrine - for 'lip' is doctrine, as shown above 
at verse 1. They do indeed acknowledge it with the lips but not with the heart, and assent with the lips is worthless when there is no assent in the heart. This is similar to the situation that exists 
with evil spirits in the next life, who are distinguished into separate communities just as good spirits are. But they are joined and held together by their having similar delusions and evil desires, 
so that they act together in persecuting truths and goods. So they have a common interest to hold them together. But as soon as that common interest ceases to exist one rushes at another, and their joy 
then consists in torturing one or more of their companions. The same applies in the world where doctrine and worship of this kind exist. People may be quite united in their acceptance of what is a 
matter of doctrine or religious practice, but the common interest holding them together is worship of self. And their acceptance is proportional to their ability to share in that common interest. But 
to the extent they cannot share or have any hope of sharing that common purpose they split up, for the reason mentioned just above, that not one of these people possesses any truth but every one has falsity 
in place of truth, and evil in place of good. This then is what is meant by 'Bach man not hearing the lip of his companion'. </p>

</p><b>1322.</b>
'Ut non audiant vir labium socii sui':  quod significet quod omnes discordes seu quod unus contra alterum, constare potest ab ipsis verbis; 'non audire labium socii' est non agnoscere quod alter loquitur, 
et in sensu interno non agnoscere quod alter docet seu doctrinam ejus, nam 'labium' est doctrina, ut ostensum supra ad vers. 1; ore quidem agnoscunt sed non corde, sed concordia oris nihil est 
cum discordia cordis; se habet hoc sicut cum malis spiritibus in altera vita qui similiter ac boni in societates distincti sunt, sed conjuncti tenentur per id quod alligati similibus phantasiis et cupiditatibus, 
sic ut unum agant in eo ut persequantur vera et bona; ita est commune quoddam quo simul continentur; sed ut primum hoc commune dissolvitur, unus ruit in alterum, et jucundum eorum tunc consistit 
in eo ut socium et socios crucient; similiter se habet cum doctrina et cultu tali in mundo; agnoscunt doctrinale et rituale satis conjunctim, sed commune quod eos continet, est cultus sui, et quantum 
participare queunt de communi tali tantum agnoscunt; at quantum non possunt participare aut spem habere participandi tantum dissolvuntur, ex causa de qua mox prius, quod nulli talium aliquod verum, 
sed unicuique falsum pro vero et malum pro bono; hoc nunc est quod 'vir non audiat labium socii sui.' </p>
