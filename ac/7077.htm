<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7077节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7077.</strong>水星灵就是这样，然而却拥有丰富的知识，故颇有几分自负（参看<a href="6813.htm">6813</a>节）；这使得他们以为，他们知道得太多了，以至于几乎不可能知道得更多了。但我们地球灵告诉他们说，他们知道得并不多，而是很少；相对来说，他们不知道的东西是无限的。他们被告知，他们不知道的，相对于他们知道的，就像大洋里的水相对于微小源泉里的水。为叫他们知道事实就是如此，一位天使灵蒙允许与他们交谈，将他们所知道和不知道的一般术语告诉了他们；并告诉他们说，还有无限事物是他们所不知道的，他们甚至永远不可能知道这些事物的共性。这个灵人通过天使的观念说话，说起话来远比他们容易得多；由于他揭示了他们所知道的和所不知道的，所以他们惊讶极了。后来，我看到另一位天使与他们交谈；他出现在右方某个高处。他列举了许多他们所不知道的事；然后又通过状态的变化与他们交谈；他们声称，他们不明白这些状态变化。这时他告诉他们，每一个状态变化，以及每个变化的每个最小部分，都包含无限事物。<br />由于他们因自己的知识而充满骄傲，所以当听到这一切时，他们开始谦卑下来。他们的谦卑表现为他们所形成的卷轴下沉；因为那时，这个群体表现为一个卷轴，就在前面朝左一段距离处，在肚脐之下那个区域的层面。但这个卷轴看似中间被挖空，陷了下去，而两边被抬高；还明显看到一种来回的运动。他们也被告知这个卷轴表示什么，即表示他们在谦卑状态下所思考的东西，而看似在两边被提起的人仍旧没有任何谦卑。我看见这卷轴被分开，那些没有谦卑下来的人被贬到自己的星球，而剩下的留了下来。水星灵躲避我们地球灵，因为地球灵对物质事物感兴趣；水星灵问这种人能否成为天使（<a href="6929.htm">6929</a>节），得到的答复是，与他们交谈的天使就来自我们这个星球。</p>

As the spirits of Mercury are of this character, and moreover abound in knowledges, they are in a kind of conceit (see n. 6813), supposing that they know so many things that it is scarcely possible to 
know more. But they have been told by the spirits of our earth that they do not know many things, but only a few, and that the things which they do not know are relatively infinite; and that the things 
which they do not know relatively to those which they do know are like the waters of the greatest ocean as compared with those of a tiny spring. In order that they might know that such is the case 
it was granted that a certain angelic spirit should speak with them, and should tell them in general what they do know and what they do not know; and that there are infinite things which they do not 
know; and also that to eternity they cannot know even the generals of things. He spoke by means of angelic ideas much more readily than they, and as he disclosed what they know, and what they do not know, 
they were struck with amazement. I afterward saw another angel speaking with them, who appeared at some elevation to the right; he enumerated very many things which they do not know; and afterward 
spoke with them by means of changes of state, which they said they do not understand. He then told them that every change of state contains infinite things, and so also does every least thing of it. [2] 
When they heard this, as they had been in conceit on account of knowledges, they began to humble themselves. The humiliation was represented by the sinking of their roll downward, for that company 
then appeared like a roll, in front toward the left at a distance, in the plane of the region below the navel; but the roll appeared as it were hollowed out in the middle, and elevated at the sides; 
a reciprocal movement was also observed therein. They were also told what this signified, namely, what they were thinking in their humiliation, and that they who appeared elevated at the sides were 
not as yet in any humiliation. And I saw that the roll was separated, and that they who were not in humiliation were relegated toward their own globe; the rest remaining. As the spirits of the planet 
Mercury shun the spirits of our earth, on account of the material things in which the latter are, and as they had asked whether such can become angels (n. 6929), they now received the reply, that the 
angel who had spoken with them was from this earth. </p>

Because spirits belonging to Mercury are like this and yet possess such an abundance of knowledge they are full of a particular kind of pride, <a href="6813.htm">6813</a>, which leads them to suppose that they possess so much 
that there can be scarcely any more for them to know. But they have been told by spirits from our planet that they know not much but little, and that the amount they do not know is in comparison infinite. 
What they do not know, they are told, compared with what they do know is like the waters of a vast ocean compared with the water of a tiny spring. To enable them to know that this was so, some 
angelic spirit was allowed to talk to them and to tell them in general terms what it was they knew and what it was they did not know, and to tell them that the number of the things they did not know 
was infinite and that eternity would be too short to allow them to have even a general knowledge of things. That spirit used the language of heavenly ideas to speak to them. He did so far more readily 
than they; and because he revealed to them what it was they knew and did not know they were struck with amazement. After that I saw another angel talking to them; he appeared rather high up over to 
the right. He listed very many things they did not know, and then went on to talk to them by means of changes of state, which they said they did not understand. At that point he told them that each change 
of state, and also each smallest part of it, contained infinite aspects. Because they were filled with pride on account of the items of knowledge in their possession they began, when they heard this, 
to humble themselves. Their humility was represented by a sinking downwards of the scroll which they formed (for that group appeared at that time as a scroll, in a forward position over on the left, 
at a distance, on the level of the region beneath the navel). But the scroll looked as though it had caved in in the middle and was raised up at the ends. A movement to and fro in it was also noticeable. 
They were also told what this scroll was a sign of, namely what they thought in their state of humility, and that those who were seen at the raised ends did not as yet have any humility. I then 
saw a separation take place in the scroll, and those without humility were banished to their own world while the rest remained behind. Because spirits from the planet Mercury, who flee from spirits 
belonging to ours on account of their interest in material things, asked whether such could become angels, <a href="6929.htm">6929</a>, they now received the reply that the angel who spoke to them came from our planet. </p>

Quia spiritus Mercurii tales sunt et usque abundant cognitionibus, in aliqua specie fastus sunt, n. 6813; inde putant quod tam multa sciant ut vix sciri plus possit; sed illis a nostrae telluris spiritibus 
dictum est quod non multa sciant sed pauca, et quod illa quae non sciunt sint infinita respective; {1}quodque illa quae non sciunt ad illa quae sciunt sint sicut aquae maximi oceani ad aquas pusilli 
fontis.  Ut scirent quod ita esset, dabatur ut quidam angelicus spiritus cum illis loqueretur, et diceret illis in {2}genere quid scirent et quid non scirent, et quod {3}infinita essent quae non 
scirent, {4}tum quod in aeternum ne quidem communia rerum scire possent.  {5}Loquebatur ille per ideas angelicas, {6} multo promptius quam illi, et quia detegebat quid scirent et quid non scirent, stupore 
perculsi sunt {7}.  Postea vidi alium angelum cum illis loquentem; apparuit ille in aliqua altitudine {8} dextrorsum; is enumerabat perplurima quae non scirent; et postea loquebatur cum illis per 
mutationes status quas dicebant se non intelligere; tunc illis dicebat quod unaquaevis mutatio status infinita contineat, et quoque unumquodvis minimum ejus.  Cum hoc audiverunt, quia fuerunt in fastu 
propter cognitiones, coeperunt se humiliare; humiliatio repraesentabatur per voluminis eorum {9}demissionem deorsum (nam apparebat cohors illa tunc sicut volumen, antrorsum versus sinistrum ad distantiam, 
in plano regionis infra umbilicum); sed volumen apparebat sicut incavatum in medio, et a lateribus elevatum; reciproca etiam motitatio ibi animadvertebatur; dicebatur etiam illis quid id significaret 
hoc est, quid cogitarent in sua humiliatione, et quod illi qui a lateribus elevati apparebant nondum in aliqua humiliatione essent; et vidi quod separaretur volumen, et quod illi qui non in humiliatione 
erant relegarentur versus suum orbem, reliquis remanentibus.   (m)Quia spiritus planetae Mercurii fugiunt spiritus nostrae telluris propter materialia in quibus sunt {10}, et quaesiverunt 
num tales possent angeli fieri, n. (x)6929, nunc responsum tulerunt quod angelus qui cum illis locutus est ex hac tellure fuerit.(n) 	@1 et quod$ 	@2 communi$ 	@3 indefinita$ 	@4 et$ 	@5 In A this
