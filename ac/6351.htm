<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6351.</strong>创世记49:5-7.西缅和利未是弟兄，他们的剑是强暴的器械。我的灵魂啊，不要进入他们的隐秘处；我的荣耀哪，不要与他们的会众联络；因为他们在怒中杀人，任意砍断牛筋。他们的怒气暴烈可咒；他们的烈怒坚硬可诅；我要把他们分散在雅各中，使他们散居在以色列。<br />“西缅和利未是弟兄”表意愿中的信，以及仁，但此处是指对立面，因为他们表示与仁分离之信。“他们的剑是强暴的器械”表教义事物用来摧毁仁爱行为，从而摧毁仁爱本身。“我的灵魂啊，不要进入他们的隐秘处”表属灵良善不想知道他们意愿的邪恶。“我的荣耀哪，不要与他们的会众联络”表属灵良善的真理不想知道由此而来的构成其思维的虚假。“因为他们在怒中杀人”表他们感到极其憎恶，并因这种感觉而毁灭信。“任意砍断牛筋”表在邪恶意愿的驱使下，他们将完全削弱或损坏外在的仁之良善。“他们的怒气暴烈可咒”表极其憎恶或严重背离良善，以及随之的诅咒。“他们的烈怒坚硬可诅”表对源于良善的真理的憎恶或背离，一种坚定且决绝的憎恶或背离。“我要把他们分散在雅各中”表他们必从属世人那里被逐出。“使他们散居在以色列”表他们也必从属灵人那里被逐出。</p>

Verses 5-7. Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of violence are their swords. Into their secret let not my soul come; in their assembly let not my glory be united; for in their anger they slew 
a man, and in their good pleasure they unstrung an ox. Cursed be their anger for it was vehement, and their wrath for it was hard. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. "Simeon and 
Levi are brethren," signifies faith in the will, and charity, here the reverse, because they signify faith separate from charity; "instruments of violence are their swords," signifies that doctrinal things 
serve to destroy the works of charity, thus charity itself; "into their secret let not my soul come," signifies that spiritual good does not desire to know the evils which are of their will; "in 
their assembly let not my glory be united," signifies that neither does the truth of spiritual good desire to know the falsities of their thought thence derived; "for in their anger they slew a man," 
signifies that they utterly averted themselves, and in their turning away extinguished faith; "and in their good pleasure they unstrung an ox," signifies that from a depraved will they utterly weakened 
the external good of charity; "cursed be their anger for it was vehement," signifies a grievous turning away from good, and the consequent condemnation; "and their wrath, for it was hard," signifies 
a turning away from the derivative truth, that it was confirmed; "I will divide them in Jacob," signifies that they must be banished from the natural man; "and scatter them in Israel," signifies from 
the spiritual man also. </p>

Verses 5-7 Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of violence are their swords. Into their secret place let my soul not come; in their congregation let not my glory be united; for in their anger they 
killed a man, and in their pleasure they hamstrung an ox. Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is hard.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel. 'Simeon 
and Levi are brothers' means faith in the will and charity, but here the opposite since faith separated from charity is meant. 'Instruments of violence are their swords' means that religious teachings 
serve to destroy charitable deeds, thus charity itself. 'Into their secret place let my soul not come means that spiritual good has no wish to know the evil intentions of their will. 'In their 
congregation let not my glory be united' means that neither does the truth of spiritual good have any wish to know the resulting false ideas constituting their thought. 'For in their anger they killed 
a man' means that they felt utterly averse, and having that feeling they annihilated faith. 'And in their pleasure they hamstrung an ox' means that motivated by a wicked will they crippled completely 
the external good of charity. 'Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce' means an utter aversion to good and consequent damnation. 'And their wrath, for it is hard' means an aversion to the truth that 
is derived from good - a firm and determined aversion. 'I will divide them in Jacob' means that they are to be banished from the natural man. 'And will scatter them in Israel' means that they are to 
be banished from the spiritual man.

Vers. 5-7.  Shimeon et Levi fratres, instrumenta violentiae machaerae eorum.  In secretum eorum ne veniat anima mea, in congregatione eorum ne uniatur gloria mea, quia in ira sua occiderunt virum, et 
in beneplacito suo enervarunt bovem.  Maledicta ira eorum quia vehemens, et excandescentia eorum quia dura; dividam eos in Jacobo, et dispergam eos in Israele. `Shimeon et Levi fratres' significat fidem 
voluntate et charitatem; hic contrarium, quia {1}fidem separatam a charitate:  `instrumenta violentiae machaerae eorum' significat quod doctrinalia serviant ad destruendum opera charitatis, ita ipsam 
charitatem:  `in secretum eorum ne veniat anima mea' significat quod bonum spirituale non scire velit mala quae voluntatis eorum:  `in congregatione eorum ne uniatur gloria mea' significat quod nec
