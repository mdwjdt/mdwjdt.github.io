<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10515</strong>.他们继续说，其星球的居民并不住在高处，而是住在地面上低矮小屋里，因为高的地方是归天上的主，而低的地方归世人。我还看到他们的小屋。它们呈长方形，里面靠墙有一张他们从头到脚都可以躺在上面的连续长榻。入口对面有一个圆形的地方，里面有一张桌子，桌子后面有一个壁炉。这壁炉照亮了整个房间。然而，壁炉里却没有燃着的火，却有发光的木头，并且发出和壁炉里的火焰一样多的光。他们说，晚上，这些原木里面仿佛有火焰，就像燃煤中所看到的火焰。</p>

They said further that the inhabitants do not dwell in high places, but upon the ground in low cottages, because high places are for the Lord who is in heaven, and low ones are for men who are on earth. 
Their cottages were also shown me. They were oblong, having within along the walls a continuous bench on which they lie, one behind another. On the side opposite to the entrance, where it is rounded, 
there is a table, and behind it a fireplace, from which the whole chamber is illuminated. In the fireplace however, there is no fire burning, but luminous wood which emits from itself as much light 
as does the flame of a fireplace. They said that in the evening these logs appear as if there were in them a fire of burning coal. </p>

They went on to say that inhabitants of the planet do not live in places high up but in lowly cottages on ground-level, because places high up are for the Lord who is in heaven and lowly ones are for 
people who are on earth. I was also shown their cottages. They were rectangular. Inside, next to the walls, runs a continuous couch on which they lie head to toe. In the part opposite the entrance, where 
there is a rounded section, stands a table, and behind the table a hearth, from which the whole chamber is lit. But there is no fire burning in that hearth; instead there is luminous wood, emitting 
as much light as the flames in a hearth do. They said that in the evening the logs of that wood appear with flames of fire in them like those seen in burning coal.  </p>

Dicebant porro quod incolae non habitent in altis sed super terra in humilibus casis, quoniam alta sunt pro Domino qui in caelo est, et humilia pro hominibus qui in terra; etiam casae eorum mihi ostensae 
sunt; oblongae erant; intus juxta parietes scamnum continuum in quo cubant, unus post alterum; in parte opposita introitui, ubi est rotundatum, est mensa, ac post illam focus, ex quo illuminatur 
tota illa camera; ast in foco illo non est ignis ardens sed est lignum luminosum, quod ex se tantum luminis effundit, quantum flamma focalis; dicebant quod ligna illa ad vesperas appareant, sicut in 
illis esset ignis prunosus. </p>
