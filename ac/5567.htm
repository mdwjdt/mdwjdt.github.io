<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5567节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5567.</strong>有一个灵人曾处于我的左侧，那时我不知道他是从哪来的，也不知道他是哪种灵人；他行事也很含糊、隐晦。此外，他想从内在深入到我里面，但被推开了。他发出一种无法描述的思维观念的总体气场；像这样的总体气场，我记得以前从未发现过。他不忠于任何基本信念，总的来说，就是反对所有人；他能利用灵巧、聪明的论据驳斥和贬损他们，尽管他不知道何为真理。令我惊讶的是，他竟被赋予这样的聪明，也就是说，有能力在不知道真理的情况下利用巧妙的论据驳斥别人。此后他走了，但很快又回来了，手里拿着一个陶罐，想给我一点喝的。这个陶罐里装有某种由错误观念所产生的酿造物，这种东西会夺走喝它之人的理解力。之所以有这样的显现，是因为他剥夺了那些在世时追随他的人对真理与良善的理解，但这些人仍旧追随他。当在天堂之光中看这个灵人时，他似乎没有脸，只有牙齿，因为他能嘲笑别人的观念，尽管他自己根本不知道真理。我被告知他是谁。他在世时曾是名人之一，并被一些这样的名人所认可。</p>

A certain one applied himself to my left side, and at that time I did not know where he came from, nor what he was; he also acted obscurely. He wanted to penetrate inwardly into me, but was kept out. 
He induced a general sphere of ideas of thought that is indescribable, and I do not remember having previously noticed any general sphere like it. He was bound by no principles, but in general was against 
all whom he could readily and ingeniously refute and censure, although he did not know what truth is. I wondered at his having the cleverness to show others to be wrong, and yet do this from no 
knowledge of truth in himself. Afterward he went away, but soon returned with an earthen jug in his hand, and wanted to give me something out of it to drink. There was in the jug, from phantasy, something 
that would take away the understanding of those who drank. This was represented because he had deprived those who were attached to him in the world of the understanding of truth and good; but still 
they clung to him. He also, in the light of heaven, did not appear with any face, but only with teeth, for the reason that he could ridicule others, and still knew nothing of truth himself. I was told 
who he was, and that when he lived, he was one of the men of note, and his nature had been known to some. </p>

A certain spirit once positioned himself by my left side, at which point I did not know where he came from or what kind of spirit he was; he also acted in an obscure manner. In addition he wished to 
get right inside me; but he was thrust away. He emitted a general sphere of ideas constituting thought, a sphere such as cannot be described; I do not remember ever detecting any sphere like it before 
then. He had not given his allegiance to any basic convictions but was in general opposed to everyone, whom he had been able to refute and disparage by the use of adroit and clever arguments without 
even knowing what the truth might be. I was astonished that he was gifted with such cleverness, that is to say, with the ability to refute others by the use of clever arguments while having no actual 
knowledge of the truth. After this he went away, but he soon returned with an earthen ware flask in his hand, from which he wanted to give me something to drink. The flask contained some brew produced 
from false notions that would take away the understanding from those who drank it. This representation took place because he had deprived those who had been his adherents in the world of their understanding 
of truth and good; yet they remained his adherents. This spirit too, when seen in the light of heaven, did not seem to have a face, only teeth, for the reason that he had been able to deride other 
people's ideas even though he himself had no knowledge at all of the truth. I was told who he was. During his lifetime he existed among the famous and was recognized by some as such. </p>

Quidam se lateri meo sinistro applicabat et tunc non sciebam unde et qualis esset, egit etiam obscure; voluit {1}quoque interius in me {2}penetrare sed rejectus est; is induxit sphaeram idearum cogitationis 
communem, talem ut describi nequeat, similem sphaeram communem non memini me prius appercepisse; nullis principiis ille alligatus fuit sed in communi erat contra omnes quos refellere et vituperare 
dextre et ingeniose potuerat, tametsi is non sciret quid verum; miratus quod tale ingenium daretur, quod nempe {3} ingeniose alios posset refellere, et tamen ex nulla apud se cognitione veri.  Postea 
abiit, sed mox rediit cum lagena fictili in manu, et voluit dare mihi aliquid inde bibendum; erat inibi tale ex {4}phantasia quod adimeret intellectum eis qui biberent; hoc repraesentabatur, quia 
illos qui ei adhaeserant in mundo, deprivaverat intellectu veri et boni, sed usque ei adhaerebant. Is quoque, in luce caeli, non apparebat in facie sed modo quoad dentes, ex causa quia irridere aliis 
potuerat, et usque nihil veri ipse sciebat. Quis esset, dictum mihi; {5} cum vixit, {6}inter famigeratos fuit et notum aliquibus quod talis. @1 etiam$ @2 intrare$ @3 i tam$ @4 i ejus$ @5 i is$ @6
