<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4270.</strong>“他夜间起来，带着两个妻子、两个使女，并十一个儿子都过了雅博渡口”表对真理的情感，连同所获得真理的第一次注入。这从“两个妻子”、“两个使女”、“儿子”和“雅博渡口”的含义清楚可知：“两个妻子”，就是此处的拉结和利亚，是指对真理的情感（参看<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）；“两个使女”，就是此处的辟拉和悉帕，是指充当手段的对真理的外层情感（<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>，<a href="3931.htm">3931</a>节）；“儿子”是指真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；“雅博渡口”是指第一次注入。“雅博渡口”之所以表示第一次注入，是因为它是迦南地的一个边界。迦南地的所有边界都是主国度的属天和属灵之物的符号或标志，其距离和位置决定了它们的确切含义（参看<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="4116.htm">4116</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>节）。这同样适用于“雅博渡口”，相对于迦南地，“雅博渡口”横跨约旦河，是流便人和迦得人所得产业的边界，这从相关经文明显看出来（如民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.24.htm">21:24</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.36.htm">2:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.37.htm">37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申3.16.htm">3:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申3.17.htm">17</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书12.2.htm">12:2</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士11.13.htm">11:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士11.22.htm">22</a>）。这地作为产业之所以归给他们，是因为流便代表理解或认知，或教义中的信，而信是重生的第一个阶段，或是作为一个整体的教义真理，生活的良善便藉着这教义的真理而获得（参看<a href="3861.htm">3861</a>，<a href="3866.htm">3866</a>节）；而迦得代表信的行为（<a href="3934.htm">3934</a>节）。也就是说，这些信之真理，或教义事物，以及信之行为，都是最先操练的行为，正在重生的人通过这些事物被引入良善。正因如此，“雅博渡口”表示第一次注入。</p>

And he rose up in that night, and took his two women, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the passage of Jabbok. That this signifies the first instilling of the affections of 
truth together with the truths acquired, is evident from the signification of the "two women," here Rachel and Leah, as being affections of truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); from the signification 
of the "two handmaids," here Bilhah and Zilpah, as being exterior affections of truth that serve as means (n. 3849, 3931); from the signification of the "sons," as being truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 
2623, 3373); and from the signification of the "passage of Jabbok," as being the first instilling. That the "Jabbok" denotes the first instilling is because it was a boundary of the land of Canaan. 
That all the boundaries of that land were significative of the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, according to their distance and situation, see n. 1585, 1866, 4116, 4240; and thus 
also the ford or passage of the Jabbok, which was such relatively to the land of Canaan beyond Jordan, and was the boundary of the inheritance of the sons of Reuben and Gad, as is evident from Num. 
21:24; Deut. 2:36, 37; 3:16, 17; Josh. 12:2; Judges 11:13, 22. That that land fell to these as an inheritance was because by Reuben was represented faith in the understanding, or doctrine, which is the 
first of regeneration, or truth of doctrine in the complex by which the good of life is attained (see n. 3861, 3866); and by Gad were represented the works of faith (n. 3934). These truths of faith 
or doctrinal things, and the works of faith which are first exercised, are the things through which the man who is being regenerated is insinuated into good. It is for this reason that by the "passage 
of Jabbok" is signified the first instilling. </p>

'And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servant-girls, and his eleven sons, and passed over at the passage of Jabbok' means the first instillation of the affections for truth, 
together with truths that had been acquired. This is clear from the meaning of 'the two wives', who in this case are Rachel and Leah, as affections for truth, dealt with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>; from 
the meaning of 'the two servant-girls', who in this case are Bilhah and Zilpah, as exterior affections for truth that serve as means, dealt with in <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>, <a href="3931.htm">3931</a>; from the meaning of 'sons' as truths, 
dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>; and from the meaning of 'the passage of Jabbok' as the first instillation. The reason why 'Jabbok' means the first instillation is that it was a boundary 
to the land of Canaan. All the boundaries of that land were signs meaning the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, the distance and position of them determining their exact meanings, 
see <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="4116.htm">4116</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>. The same applies to 'the ford (or passage) of Jabbok', which in relation to the land of Canaan was across the Jordan and was the boundary of the inheritance of the children 
of Reuben and Gad, as becomes clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:24</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:36,%2037;%203:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:36, 37; 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2012:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 12:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2011:13,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 11:13, 22</a>. The reason why that territory had fallen to them as an inheritance was that Reuben represented 
faith in the understanding, or doctrine, which is the first stage of regeneration, or the truth of doctrine as a whole, by means of which the good of life is arrived at, see <a href="3861.htm">3861</a>, <a href="3866.htm">3866</a>; while Gad 
represented the works of faith, <a href="3934.htm">3934</a>. That is to say, those truths of faith or matters of doctrine, and these works of faith which are the works performed first, are the ones by means of which a person 
who is being regenerated is led on into good. This is why 'the passage of Jabbok' means the first instillation. </p>

`Et surrexit in nocte illa, et accepit binas feminas suas, et binas ancillas suas, et undecim natos suos, et transivit transitum Jabbok':  quod significet insinuationem primam affectionum veri cum 
veris acquisitis, constat ex significatione `binarum feminarum,' hic Rachelis et Leae, quod sint affectiones veri, de qua n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819; a significatione `binarum ancillarum,' hic Bilhae 
et Zilpae, quod sint affectiones veri exteriores inservientes pro mediis, de qua n. 3849, 3931; ex significatione `natorum' seu filiorum quod sint vera, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373; 
et ex significatione `transitus Jabbok' quod sit insinuatio prima.  Quod `Jabbok' sit insinuatio prima, est quia terminus erat terrae Canaanis; quod omnes termini illius terrae significativi fuerint 
caelestium et spiritualium regni Domini secundum distantiam et situm, videatur n. 1585, 1866, 4116, 4240, ita quoque vadum seu `transitus Jabbok' quod erat respective ad terram Canaanem trans 
Jordanem, et fuit terminus hereditatis filiorum Reubenis et Gadis, ut constare potest ex Num. xxi 24; Deut. ii 36, 37; iii 16, 17; Jos. xii 2; Jud. xi 13, 22; </p>
<p>quod cesserit illis in hereditatem, erat 
`quia' per Reubenem {1} repraesentata fuit fides intellectu seu doctrina, quae primum est regenerationis, (o)aut in complexu verum doctrinae per quod ad bonum vitae pervenitur, videatur n. 3861, 
3866; et per `Gadem' repraesentata sunt opera {2} fidei, n. 3934, haec nempe vera fidei seu doctrinalia, et opera fidei quae primum exercentur, sunt per quae homo qui regeneratur, in bonum insinuatur; 
inde est quod per `transitum Jabbok' significetur insinuatio prima.      @1 i enim$      @2 i quae sunt$ </p>
