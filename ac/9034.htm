<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9034.</strong>“人若用棍子打奴仆或婢女”表如果教会里有人利用自己的能力恶待记忆真理或对它的情感。这从“打”、“人”、“奴仆”、“婢女”和“棍”的含义清楚可知：“打”是指恶待，因为“打”是指造成任何伤害；“人”，此处即以色列人中的一个男人，是指一个教会成员，因而是指一个拥有属灵真理的人，这属灵真理就是源于圣言的教会信之教义的真理（参看<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>，<a href="6862.htm">6862</a>，<a href="6868.htm">6868</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7062.htm">7062</a>，<a href="7198.htm">7198</a>，<a href="7201.htm">7201</a>，<a href="7215.htm">7215</a>，<a href="7223.htm">7223</a>，<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>，<a href="8234.htm">8234</a>，<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）；“奴仆”是指记忆真理，就是圣言的真理，不过是其字义的真理，如下文所述；“婢女”是指属世情感，因而是对记忆知识的情感，因为这些知识存在于属世层中（<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>，<a href="3835.htm">3835</a>，<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>，<a href="8993.htm">8993</a>，<a href="8994.htm">8994</a>节）；“棍”是指属世的能力（<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>，<a href="4936.htm">4936</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7026.htm">7026</a>节），在此是指人自己的能力，因为经上正在说那被买来的奴仆。由此明显可知，“人若打奴仆或婢女”表示如果教会里有人恶待圣言的记忆真理或对它的情感。<br />“奴仆”之所以表示圣言字义的真理，是因为“仆人”一般表示低层或外层事物，这些事物服务于高层或内层事物（<a href="2541.htm">2541</a>，<a href="5161.htm">5161</a>，<a href="5164.htm">5164</a>，<a href="5936.htm">5936</a>，<a href="7143.htm">7143</a>节）。从这一般意义上说，“仆人”表示属世层，因为属世层服务于属灵层（<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>，<a href="3020.htm">3020</a>，<a href="5305.htm">5305</a>，<a href="7998.htm">7998</a>节）；从这层意义上说，它表示属圣言字义的记忆真理，因为这真理服务于属内义的属灵真理。属圣言字义的真理与教会的信之教义的纯正真理是一样的。<br />必须简要阐述一下圣言字义真理如何服务于属灵真理。教会成员首先从圣言字义学习真理。这是适合居于属世之光的外在人的理解力的一般真理。这真理通过一种外在途径，也就是通过听被接受，并存在外在人的记忆中，而外在人的记忆还有从世界所获得的各种记忆知识（<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>节）。后来，存在这记忆中的事物进入在天堂之光中看事物的内在人的视野或注视之下。内在人从它们当中拣选并召唤出与从主经由灵魂流入，并已经被此人接受的良善一致的真理。主在那里将这些真理与良善结合起来。以这种方式在内在人中被结合起来的真理被称为“属灵真理”而与这些真理结合的良善则被称为“属灵良善”。通过真理所形成的这种良善构成人的属灵生命。那里的真理本身被称为“信之真理”，良善被称为“仁之良善”。真理以这种方式被植入其中的良善就是与人同在的教会。<br />由此可见圣言字义的真理如何服务于属灵真理的形成，以及一般如何服务于那构成属灵生命的信与仁的形成；这生命就在于被因真理引向良善而对真理的情感激发，然后被对真理所引向的良善的情感激发，最终被对从那良善所流出的真理的情感激发。</p>

And when a man shall smite his manservant, or his maidservant, with a rod. That this signifies if anyone within the church ill-treats the truth of memory, or its affection, from his own power, is evident 
from the signification of "smiting," as being to ill-treat, for "smiting" is predicated of any injury whatsoever; from the signification of "a man" [vir], here a man of the sons of Israel, as being 
one who is of the church, and who consequently is in spiritual truth, which is the truth of the doctrine of faith of the church from the Word (see n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 
7215, 7223, 7957, 8234, 8805); from the signification of a "manservant," as being memory-truth, which is the truth of the Word, but of its literal sense (of which below); from the signification of a 
"maidservant," as being natural affection, thus the affection of memory knowledges, because these are in the natural (n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849, 8993, 8994); and from the signification of a "rod," as 
being natural power (n. 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026), here, one's own power, because the manservant of whom it is said, was bought. From this it is plain that by the words, "if a man shall smite his 
manservant, or his maidservant," is signified if anyone within the church ill-treats the memory-truth of the Word, or its affection. [2] The reason why a "manservant" denotes the truth of the literal 
sense of the Word, is that by a "servant" in general are signified lower or exterior things, because these serve higher or interior things (n. 2541, 5161, 5164, 5936, 7143); consequently by a "servant" 
is signified the natural, because this serves the spiritual (n. 3019, 3020, 5305, 7998), consequently memory-truth, which belongs to the literal sense of the Word, for this serves spiritual truth, 
which belongs to the internal sense. The truth of the internal sense of the Word is the same as the genuine truth of the doctrine of faith of the church. [3] How the truth of the literal sense of the 
Word serves spiritual truth, shall be briefly told. The man of the church first learns truth from the literal sense of the Word, which is general truth accommodated to the apprehension of the external 
man, who is in natural light. This truth is received by an external way, that is, by hearing, and is stored up in the memory of the external man, where are also various memory-knowledges derived from 
the world (n. 2469-2494). Afterward the things stored up in this memory are subjected to the sight or view of the internal man, who sees from the light of heaven. The internal man calls forth therefrom 
by selection the truths which agree with the good which flows in from the Lord by the way of the soul, and which the man had received. There the Lord conjoins these truths with good. The truths which 
are thus conjoined in the internal man are called "spiritual truths," and the good with which the truths are conjoined is called "spiritual good." This good, formed by means of truths, is what makes 
the spiritual life of man. The truths themselves there are called "the truths of faith," and the good is called "the good of charity." The good in which truths have thus been implanted is the church 
with man. [4] From this it is plain in what manner the truths of the literal sense of the Word serve for the formation of spiritual truths, in general for the formation of faith and of charity, which 
make the spiritual life; which life consists in being affected with truths for the sake of good, and in being affected with good from truths, and finally in being affected with truths from good. </p>

'And when a man strikes his male slave or his female slave [with a rod]' means if anyone within the Church mistreats a factual truth or an affection for it from his own power. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'striking' as mistreating, for 'striking' refers to inflicting any kind of hurt; from the meaning of 'a man', here a man from among the children of Israel, as a member of the Church and therefore 
one in possession of spiritual truth, which is truth derived from the Word and contained in the teachings and belief of the Church, dealt with in <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>, <a href="6862.htm">6862</a>, <a href="6868.htm">6868</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7062.htm">7062</a>, <a href="7198.htm">7198</a>, <a href="7201.htm">7201</a>, <a href="7215.htm">7215</a>, <a href="7223.htm">7223</a>, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, <a href="8234.htm">8234</a>, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>; from the meaning of 'male slave' as factual truth, which is truth belonging to the Word, as stated in its literal sense, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'a female 
slave' as a natural affection, thus an affection for known facts, since these reside in the natural, dealt with in <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>, <a href="3835.htm">3835</a>, <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>, <a href="8993.htm">8993</a>, <a href="8994.htm">8994</a>; and from the meaning of 'a rod' as the power of the 
natural, dealt with in <a href="4876.htm">4876</a>, <a href="4936.htm">4936</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7026.htm">7026</a>, at this point a person's own power, since it is speaking in regard to a slave who had been bought. From all this it is evident that 'when a man 
strikes his male slave or his female slave' means if anyone within the Church mistreats a factual truth in the Word or an affection for it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'a male slave' means truth belonging to 
the literal sense of the Word is that in general 'a slave' means lower or more external things, because these things serve higher or more internal ones, <a href="2541.htm">2541</a>, <a href="5161.htm">5161</a>, <a href="5164.htm">5164</a>, <a href="5936.htm">5936</a>, <a href="7143.htm">7143</a>. From this general 
meaning 'a slave' means the natural, because this serves the spiritual, <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, <a href="3020.htm">3020</a>, <a href="5305.htm">5305</a>, <a href="7998.htm">7998</a>; and following on from this it means factual truth belonging to the literal sense of the Word, for this 
truth serves spiritual truth belonging to the internal sense. Truth belonging to the internal sense of the Word is the same as genuine truth contained in the teachings that compose the Church's faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In what way truth belonging to the literal sense of the Word serves spiritual truth must be stated briefly. A member of the Church first of all learns truth from the literal sense of the Word. 
This is general truth suited to the understanding of the external man, who dwells in natural light. That truth is received by an external route, which is that of hearing, and is stored in the external 
man's memory, where there are also various pieces of knowledge gained from the world, <a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>. Later on matters stored in this memory come under the vision or gaze of the internal man, who sees 
things in the light of heaven. The internal man selects and summons from among them truths that are in agreement with the good which flows in from the Lord by way of the soul and which the person has 
accepted. There the Lord joins the truths to the good. The truths joined in that way in the internal man are called spiritual truths, and the good to which the truths have been joined is called spiritual 
good. This good, given form by the truths, constitutes the person's spiritual life. The actual truths there are called the truths of faith, and the good is called the good of charity. The good in 
which the truths have been implanted in that way is the Church with that person. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this one may see how truths belonging to the literal sense of the Word serve to give form to spiritual 
truths, in general to give form to faith and charity which compose spiritual life - life which consists in being fired by an affection for truths because they lead to good, then by an affection for the 
good that the truths lead to, and finally by an affection for truths that flow from that good. </p>

verum sensus interni Verbi est idem cum vero genuino doctrinae fidei Ecclesiae. Quomodo verum sensus litteralis Verbi inservit vero {3}spirituali, 3 paucis dicetur: ab homine Ecclesiae primum discitur
