<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6985节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6985.</strong>“我本是拙口笨舌的”表来自神性的声音和言语是听不见，领悟不了的。这从“口”和“舌”的含义清楚可知：“口”是指声音；“舌”是指言语。“口”之所以表示声音，是因为它是声音器官；“舌”之所以表示言语，是因为它是语言器官。谁都能清楚看出声音和言语之间的区别，“声音”与“听”有关，“言语”与“领悟”有关。这一点在文字的历史意义上只能用“拙口笨舌”来表达，这层意义提到摩西是一个说话困难的人。但是，当这种表达进入内义时，天使就会认为它与所论述的主题有关；当它论及神性时，它被认为是表示来自神性的声音无法被直接听见，来自神性的言语也无法直接被领悟，只能通过灵人间接被听见、领悟，如前所述（<a href="6982.htm">6982</a>节）。</p>

Because heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue am I. That this signifies that the voice and speech from the Divine are not heard or perceived, is evident from the signification of "mouth," as being voice; 
and from the signification of "tongue," as being speech. By "mouth," is signified voice, because it is the organ of the voice; and by "tongue" is signified speech, because it is the organ of speech. 
The difference between voice and speech is plain to everyone, also that "to be heard" is said of the voice, and "to be perceived" of speech. This cannot be expressed in the historic sense of the letter, 
where Moses is spoken of as a man, and who could speak, but with difficulty, otherwise than by being "heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue." But when this passes into the internal sense, it is perceived 
by the angels as being said in respect to the subject treated of; and when it is said of the Divine, it is perceived that the voice proceeding thence cannot be heard nor the speech be perceived immediately, 
but mediately through spirits, according to what was said above (n. 6982). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6985</b></p><p><b>6985.</b>
'For I am heavy in mouth and heavy in tongue' means that voice and speech from the Divine is not heard and not discerned. This is clear from the meaning of 'mouth' as voice, and from the meaning of 'tongue 
as speech. 'Mouth' means voice because it is the organ used by the voice, and 'tongue means speech because it is the organ used in speech. Anyone can see what the difference is between voice and 
speech, and that 'voice' is used in connection with being heard, but 'speech' with being discerned. In the literal sense written as history, where reference is made to Moses' being a person who could 
speak only with difficulty, there is no other way than 'heavy in mouth and heavy in tongue' to express the matter. But when this expression passes into the internal sense it is discerned by the angels 
in connection with the subject there; and when it is said of the Divine it is discerned to mean that the voice from the Divine cannot be heard directly, nor the speech from Him be discerned directly, 
only indirectly through spirits, as accords with what has been stated above in <a href="6982.htm">6982</a>.  </p>

</p><b>6985.</b>
`Quia gravis ore, et gravis lingua ego': quod significet quod vox et loquela a Divino non audiatur nec percipiatur, constat ex significatione `oris' quod sit vox; et ex significatione `linguae' quod 
sit loquela; per `os' significatur vox quia est organum vocis, et per `linguam' significatur loquela quia est organum loquelae; quae differentia {1}sit inter vocem et inter loquelam, cuivis patet, tum 
quod de `voce' praedicetur audiri, et de `loquela' percipi.  Hoc non aliter in sensu litterae historico exprimi potest, ubi agitur de Moscheh qui homo, et {2}loqui potuit sed difficulter, quam per `gravem 
ore et gravem lingua'; quod cum abit in sensum internum, percipitur ab angelis praedicate ad subjectum, {3}et cum dicitur de Divino, percipitur quod vox inde immediate non possit audiri, nec loquela 
percipi {4}, sed mediate per {5}spiritus, secundum illa quae supra n. (x)6982 dicta sunt. 	@1 After loquelam$ 	@2 difficulter loqui potuit$ 	@3 ita cum ad Divinum, tunc$ 	@4 i immediata a Divino$ 	@5
