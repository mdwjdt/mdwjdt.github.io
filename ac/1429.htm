<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1429节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1429.</strong>“亚伯兰是年七十五岁的儿子”表尚没有那么多的神性。这从数字“五”和“七十”的含义清楚可知，“五”表少许，“七十”表神圣之物。“五”表少许，这在前面已说明（<a href="649.htm">649</a>节），“七十”和“七” 一样，表神圣之物（<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）。此处由于“七十”用来论及主，所以它表神圣的神性。亚伯兰的年岁在内义上还表其它事物，这从前面有关年岁和数字的阐述和说明（<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>节）清楚可知；还可从以下事实看出来：圣言的一笔一划都具有内义。若不包含属灵、属天之物，经上就不会提及亚伯兰那时是“七十五岁的儿子”，也不会提及亚伯兰在那个年纪所发生的这个事件，这也可从圣言中出现的其它数字清楚看出来，无论涉及年岁的还是涉及度量的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1429.</strong> The fact that and Abram was a son of seventy-five years means that he did not yet have much divinity can be seen from the symbolism of five as a little and of seventy as holiness. The symbolism of five as a little was illustrated above in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_649" target=_top>649</a> and that of seventy (or seven) as holiness in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_433" target=_top>433</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716" target=_top>716</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_881" target=_top>881</a>. Since the number seventy is mentioned in connection with the Lord here, it symbolizes divine holiness.<br />Previous statements and proofs regarding years and numbers (搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482" target=_top>482</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487" target=_top>487</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493" target=_top>493</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575" target=_top>575</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_647" target=_top>647</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_648" target=_top>648</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755" target=_top>755</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_813" target=_top>813</a>) show that on a deeper level, the numbers counting Abram's years have a different meaning [than the literal one]. The same conclusion is indicated by the fact that the Word contains not so much as a syllable or even a mark that lacks an inner meaning. It would never have been mentioned that Abram was then [a son] of seventy-five years if this had not involved spiritual and heavenly matters, and in fact the event would not have occurred at that particular stage of his life. The presence of a deeper meaning can also be seen from other numbers measuring both years and concrete objects in the Word.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For examples of passages treating the inner meaning of a number in the Bible, see note 2 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>, note 3 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487" target=_top>487</a>, note 2 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_900" target=_top>900</a>.

Abram was a son of five years and seventy years. That this signifies that as yet there was not very much of the Divine, is evident from the signification of the number "five" as being a little, and of 
the number "seventy" as being what is holy. That "five" denotes a little, has been shown above (n. 649); and also that "seventy," like "seven," signifies what is holy (n. 395, 433, 716, 881): here, 
because "seventy" is a predicated of the Lord, it signifies the holy Divine. That in the internal sense the numbers of Abram's years also signify other things, is evident from what has been said and shown 
before concerning years and numbers (n. 482, 487, 493, 575, 647, 648,, 755, 813); and also from the fact that there is not a syllable or iota in the Word which has not an internal sense; and unless 
spiritual and celestial things were involved, it would not have been mentioned that Abram was then five years and seventy years old; neither would this have taken place at this age of Abram; as is 
evident also from other numbers, both of years and of measures, that occur in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1429</b></p><p><b>1429.</b>
'Abram was a son of seventy-five years' means that as yet there was not so much of the Divine. This becomes clear from the meaning of the number 'five' as that which is small, and of the number 'seventy' 
as that which is holy. That 'five' means that which is small has been shown already in <a href="649.htm">649</a>, and that 'seventy' or 'sever' that which is holy in <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a> Here, since seventy is used in reference 
to the Lord, it means that which is Divine and holy. Furthermore that the numbers<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> giving Abram's years have a different meaning in the internal sense may become clear from what has been stated 
and shown already about years and numbers in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, and from the fact that not one tiny expression or part of a letter exists in the Word that does not carry an internal 
sense. And unless it embodied things that are spiritual and celestial no mention would ever have been made of Abram's being at that time 'a son of seventy-five years', or of this event taking place 
when he was that age, as is also clear from other numbers, both of years and of quantities, that are given in the Word.

</p><b>1429.</b>
Quod 'Abram filius quinque annorum et septuaginta annorum' significet quod adhuc non ita multum Divini, constare potest a significatione numerorum 'quinque' quod sit parum, et numerorum 'septuaginta' 
quod sit sanctum; quod quinque sint parum, ostensum est prius n. 649, quodque septuaginta seu septem sint sanctum, n. 395, 433, 716, 881; hic quia septuaginta praedicantur de Domino, significant sanctum 
Divinum.  Quod numeri annorum Abrami etiam in sensu interno significent alia, constare potest ab illis quae prius de annis et numeris dicta et ostensa sunt n. 482, 487, 493, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 
et ex eo quod nulla vocula et iota in Verbo detur quae non internum sensum habeat; et nisi spiritualia et caelestia involveret, nusquam memoratum fuisset quod Abramus tunc fuisset quinque annorum 
et septuaginta annorum, et hoc nec exstitisset in hac ejus aetate; sicut etiam constare potest ab aliis numeris tam annorum quam mensurarum in Verbo. </p>
