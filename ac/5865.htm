<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5865节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5865.</strong>有一个灵人，不是恶灵，被允许来到一个人这里，从那里与我交谈。当来到此人这里时，他说，他能看见看似一种无生命的黑色物体，或一团无生命的黑色物质。这是他被允许看见的那人的肉体生命。然后有人说，当人被允许观看拥有信之良善之人的肉体生命时，它看上去不像一个黑色物体，而像具有木头颜色的木质物体。我通过别人的经历同样得知了这一点。一个恶灵通过基于身体感官印象，因而基于外在记忆的思维而被带入肉体状态。这时，我也看见他如同一团无生命的黑色物体。当恢复到正常状态时，他说他原以为自己仍过着肉身生活。在其它情况下，灵人都不允许看人的肉体事物，因为这些属于世界及其光；当灵人观看那些属于世界之光的事物时，它们看似纯粹的黑暗。</p>

There was a certain spirit, not evil, to whom it was permitted to pass over to a certain man and speak with me from thence. When he came to the man he said that there appeared to him as it were a kind 
of black inanimate something, or as it were a black lifeless mass. This was the bodily life of the man, which he was permitted to view. It was said that the bodily life of a man who is in the good of 
faith appears, when one is permitted to view it, not black, but woody and of the color of wood. The same was given me to know by another experience. A certain evil spirit was let into the state of the 
body, by thinking from the sensuous things of the body, thus from the external memory. He then seemed to me as a black lifeless mass. When he was restored, he said that he had supposed he was in the 
life of the body. In other cases spirits are not allowed to look into the bodily things of man, for these are in the world and its light, and when spirits look at those things which are of the light 
of the world, these appear as mere darkness. </p>

There was once a spirit, not an evil one, who was allowed to pass over to a certain person and to talk to me from there. Having arrived the spirit said that he could see what looked like a black inanimate 
object or black lifeless mass; it was that person's bodily life which the spirit was allowed to see. Then it was said that when one is allowed to see the bodily life of a person in possession of 
the good of faith, it does not look like a black object but a wooden one, the colour of wood. I learned much the same by another experience. A certain evil spirit was let into the bodily state by forming 
his thoughts from the impressions of the bodily senses, thus from his external memory. At this time I saw him too as a black lifeless mass. When restored to his normal state he said that he had thought 
he was living a bodily life. Spirits are not under any other circumstances allowed to see the bodily aspects of a person, for a person's bodily aspects belong to the world and worldly light, and 
when spirits see things belonging to worldly light they look like utter darkness. </p>

</p><b>5865.</b>
Erat quidam spiritus non malus, cui permissum ad aliquem hominem transire et inde mecum loqui; cum illuc venit, {1}dicebat quod appareret ei sicut quoddam nigrum inanimatum, seu sicut moles nigra nullius 
vitae, hoc fuit vita istius hominis corporea quam ei permissum spectare; dictum quod vita corporea hominis qui in bono fidei, appareat, cum licet illam spectare, non ut nigrum sed ut ligneum, et 
lignei coloris. Simile datum scire per aliam experientiam; quidam spiritus malus missus est in statum corporis, per id quod ex sensualibus corporis, ita ex memoria externa, cogitaret, tunc visus est 
mihi is quoque ut moles nigra nullius vitae; idem, cum restitutus, dixit quod putaret se fuisse in vita corporis. Alioquin spiritibus non licet spectare in  corporea hominis; corporea enim hominis in 
mundo sunt et in ejus luce, cum spiritus spectant in illa quae lucis mundi sunt, apparent illa quae ibi {2}sicut merae tenebrae. @1 i dabatur illi tunc visus talis, ut spectare posset hominem quoad ejus 
corporea$ @2 tenebrosissima$ </p>
