<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7996节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7996.</strong>“外邦人都不可吃它”表那些没有真理和良善的人要与他们分开。这从“外邦人”和“不可吃它”的含义清楚可知：“外邦人”是指那些在教会之外，不接受任何信之真理和良善的人，如迦南地各个民族的情形（参看<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2115.htm">2115</a>节），因而是指那些没有真理和良善的人；“不可吃它”是指不可与他们接触或结合，因而与他们分开。接下来的经文论述了谁可以吃逾越节的筵席，谁不可以。逾越节的晚餐代表天上彼此一起生活的善人的组合。接下来的几节经文中的条例表明谁能被包括在内，谁不能。在古时，一般来说，筵席，无论午餐还是晚餐，都在教会内举办，以便人们能彼此联系，互相教导关于爱和信的事，因而教导关于天堂的事（参看<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>，<a href="5161.htm">5161</a>节）。这就是那时参加筵席的快乐所在，这也是办午餐和晚餐的目的所在。人们的心灵由此得到滋养，他们的身体也同时得到相应滋养。结果，他们享有健康长寿，由此获得聪明和智慧，还由此与天堂交流，有些人则享有与天使的开放式交流。但随着时间推移，一切内在事物都消失不见，并让位于外在事物，节日和筵席的目的也是如此。如今举办这些节日和筵席不是为了把人们引向属灵的结合或团契，而是引向世俗的结合或联系。也就是说，它们是为了物质利益，为了追求高级职位，以及纯粹的享乐而举办的。它们为身体提供了滋养，但没有为心灵提供任何滋养。</p>

No son of an alien shall eat of it. That this signifies that those who are not in truth and good are to be separated from them, is evident from the signification of "an alien," as being those out of 
the church who do not acknowledge anything of the truth and good of faith, as was the case with the nations in the land of Canaan (see n. 2049, 2115), thus who are not in truth and good; and from the 
signification of "not eating of it," as being to communicate and be conjoined with them, thus to be separated from them. In what now follows those are treated of who should eat the passover together, 
and those who should not. The supper of the passover represented the consociations of the good in heaven; and in the statutes which follow, it is declared who could be consociated and who could not. In 
general, feasts, both dinners and suppers, in ancient times were made within the church in order that they might be consociated and conjoined as to love, and that they might instruct one another in 
those things which are of love and faith, thus in the things of heaven (see n. 3596, 3832, 5161). Such at that time were the delights attending their banquets, and such was the end for the sake of which 
were their dinners and suppers. Thus the mind and the body also were nourished unanimously and correspondently; and from this they had health and long life, and from it they had intelligence and wisdom; 
and also from this they had communication with heaven, and some had open communication with angels. But as in course of time all internal things vanish away and pass into external ones, so also 
did the purposes of the feasts and banquets, which at this day are not for the sake of any spiritual conjunction, but for the sake of worldly conjunctions, namely, for the sake of gain, for the sake of 
the pursuit of honors, and for the sake of pleasures, from which there is nourishment of the body, but none of the mind. </p>

'No son of a foreigner shall eat it' means that those not in possession of truth and good are set apart from them. This is clear from the meaning of 'a foreigner' as those who are outside the Church 
and unreceptive of anything of the truth or good of faith, as the nations in the land of Canaan were, dealt with in <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2115.htm">2115</a>, thus those who are not in possession of truth and good; and from the meaning 
of 'not eating it' as not having any contact with them or being joined to them, thus being set apart from them. The verses immediately following deal with those who shall eat the Passover together 
and those who shall not eat it. The Passover was a supper, representing the groups of good people living in association with one another in heaven. The statutes in the verses that follow indicate who 
exactly could be included and who could not. In general the banquets within the Church in ancient times, both midday meals and suppers, were held in order that people might be brought into association 
with one another and joined together in love, and in order that they might inform one another about matters of love and faith, and so about the things of heaven, see <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>, <a href="5161.htm">5161</a>. Such were the 
delights surrounding feasts in those times, and they were the end in view in holding midday meals and suppers. People's minds were thereby nourished, and also their bodies in a parallel and corresponding 
way. As a result they enjoyed good health and long life, they received intelligence and wisdom, and they were also brought into communication with heaven, some into open communication with angels. 
But as in course of time all internal things disappear and give way to external ones, so it is with the ends to which banquets and feasts are held. At the present day these are held not to draw people 
together into any spiritual fellowship but to create worldly connections. That is to say, they are held for the sake of material gain, the quest for high office, and mere pleasures. They provide nourishment 
for the body, but none for the mind. </p>

`Omnis filius alienigenae non comedet illud': quod significet illos qui non in vero et bono, quod ab illis separati, constat ex significatione `alienigenae' quod sint qui extra Ecclesiam non agnoscentes 
aliquid veri et boni quae fidei, ut fuerunt gentes in terra Canaane, de qua n. 2049, 2115, ita qui non in vero et bono; et ex significatione `non comedere illud' {1} quod sit non communicare (c)et 
conjungi cum illis, ita {2}separati ab illis; (m)agitur in nunc sequentibus de illis qui simul {3}comedent Paesach, et qui non {3}comedent; erat Paesach cena, quae {4}repraesentabat consociationes bonorum 
in caelo; in statutis quae {5} sequuntur, indicatur quinam consociari possent, et quinam non {6} possent.(n)  In genere convivia tam prandia quam cenae antiquis temporibus intra Ecclesiam fiebant 
ut consociarentur et conjungerentur quoad amorem, ac ut se mutuo instruerent in illis quae amoris et fidei, ita in illis quae caeli, videatur n. 3596, 3832, 5161; talia fuerunt illo tempore jucunda 
circa (x)comessationes, et fuerunt finis propter quem prandia (c)et cenae; {7}ita nutriebatur mens et quoque corpus unanimiter et correspondenter; inde illis sanitas ac vita longaeva, ac inde illis intelligentia 
et sapientia, {8}tum inde illis communicatio cum caelo, et quibusdam manifesta cum angelis.  {9} At sicut omnia interna {10} successu temporis evanescunt, (c)et abeunt in externa, ita quoque 
conviviorum {11}et (x)comessationum fines qui hodie non sunt propter conjunctionem aliquam spiritualem sed propter conjunctiones mundanas, nempe propter lucra, propter ambitus honorum, {12}et propter 
voluptates {13}, inde nutritio corporis, sed nulla mentis{14}. 	@1 i, nempe Paesach,$ 	@2 separari$ 	@3 comederent$ 	@4 repraesentabant I$ 	@5 i nunc$ 	@6 i consociari$ 	@7 jucunda illa erant 
illis cibus coelestis, qui cibus etiam repraesentatur in cibis qui super mensa, inde illis fuerunt jucunda externa et interna simul, ac vere jucunda quia externa repraesentabant interna illa, nempe 
terrestres cibi coelestes, per illos nutriebatur mens, et per hos corpus$ 	@8 ac inde quoque$ 	@9 i Caena paschalis tale convivium fuit, illis qui in Ecclesia repraesentativa; Sancta Caena quae successit 
etiam tale fuit cum Ecclesia Christiana inchoabatur;$ 	@10 i Ecclesiae$ 	@11 seu$ 	@12 tum quoque$ 	@13 i corporeas$ 	@14 i; sed talia sunt consociationes infernales, quae sunt conjunctiones 
ac amicitiae externae, animis hostilia spirant contra se mutuo ac contra alios, nam in infernis non sunt conjunctiones, sed tales illorum quales inter se sunt latronum, inde corpori non sanitas, minus 
menti, sed corpori morbi ac menti insaniae, ac vita denique in inferno$ </p>
