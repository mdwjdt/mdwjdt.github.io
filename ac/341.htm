<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第341节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>341.</strong>创世记4:2 又生了该隐的兄弟亚伯。亚伯是牧羊的，该隐是种地的。<br />上古教会生出的第二个是仁，以“亚伯”和“兄弟”来表示；“牧羊的”表践行从仁流出的良善者，而“种地的”表没有仁，出于从爱分离之信行事者，其实这信根本不是信。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]341.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_341/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_2" target=_top>Genesis 4:2</a>. And she went on to deliver his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd of the flock; and Cain was one who cultivated the ground.<br />The church's second-born is charity, symbolized by Abel and brother. A shepherd of the flock is people who do the good that charity inspires. One who cultivated the ground is people who lack charity, however attached they may be to a faith separated from love, which is no kind of faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 341</b></p><p><b>341.</b>
Verse 2. And she added to bear his brother Abel; and Abel was a shepherd of the flock, and Cain was a tiller of the ground. The second offspring of the church is charity, signified by "Abel" and "brother;" 
a "shepherd of the flock" denotes one who exercises the good of charity; and a "tiller of the ground" is one who is devoid of charity, however much he may be in faith separated from love, which 
is no faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 341</b></p><p><b>341.</b>
Verse 2 And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel was a Shepherd of the flock, and Cain was a tiller of the ground.  </p>
<p>The second born of the Church is charity, which is meant by 'Abel' and by 
'brother. A shepherd of the flock' means one who practices good flowing from charity, while 'a tiller of the ground' means someone who, devoid of charity, acts from faith separated from love, which is 
not faith at all.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 341</b>
</p><b>341.</b>
Vers. 2.  Et addidit parere fratrem ejus, Habel; et fuit Habel pastor gregis, et Cain fuit colens humum. Alter partus Ecclesiae est charitas, quae significatur per 'Habelem' et 'fratrem': 'pastor gregis' 
est qui exercet bonum charitatis: 'colens humum' est qui absque charitate, utcumque ex fide separata ab amore, quae nulla fides. </p>
