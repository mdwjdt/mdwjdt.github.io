<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2053节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2053.</strong>“我的约就立在你们肉体上”表主在人的肮脏中与他结合，也表有意义的仪式。这从“约”和“肉体”的含义清楚可知：“约”是指结合，如前面所解释的（<a href="2041.htm">2041</a>节）。至于这自我何等肮脏，这在那里也有所阐述，并在第一卷有所说明（<a href="141.htm">141</a>，<a href="150.htm">150</a>，<a href="154.htm">154</a>，<a href="210.htm">210</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>，<a href="731.htm">731</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>，<a href="987.htm">987</a>，<a href="1047.htm">1047</a>节）。关于“我的约就立在你们肉体上”是指主在人的肮脏中与他结合，情况是这样：人并没有纯粹的智性真理（intellectual truth），即神性真理，因为人所具有的信之真理是粘附着感官幻觉的真理表象，而属自我之爱和对这个世界之爱的欲望的虚假反过来粘附于这些感官幻觉。这就是人所具有的真理。至于这些真理何等肮脏，这从这类幻觉和虚假粘附于它们的事实清楚可知。<br />尽管如此，主仍在这些肮脏的真理中将祂自己与人联结起来，因为祂以纯真和仁爱带给它们灵魂和生命，并以这种方式形成良知。良知的真理各种各样，即它们取决于每个人的宗教信仰。只要这些真理不违背信之良善，主不会对它们施暴。因为这个人一直认可它们，并视其为神圣。主不破碎任何人，而是将他弯过来。这从以下事实可以看出来：教会中的各种宗教思想都有一些具有良知的追随者。这良知随着其真理日益接近信之纯正真理而越来越好。由于良知通过这类真理形成，故显而易见，它一直在人心智的理解力部分形成，因为接受这些真理的是理解力部分。因此，主奇迹般将其心智的这一部分从意愿部分那里分离出来。这是一个前所未知的奥秘，对此，可参看第一卷（<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>节）。“约立在你们肉体上”也表有意义的记号，即洁净的记号。这从前面有关割礼的说明清楚可知（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）。</p>

My covenant shall be in your flesh. That this signifies the conjunction of the Lord with man in his impurity, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction (explained above); 
and from the signification of "flesh," as being what is man's own (also explained above, n. 2041: how impure what is man's own is was also stated there, and was shown in Part First, n. 141, 150, 154, 
210, 215, 694, 731, 874-876, 987, 1047). As regards the words "my covenant in your flesh" denoting the conjunction of the Lord with man in his impurity, the case is this: With man there is no pure intellectual 
truth, that is, truth Divine; for the truths of faith appertaining to man are appearances of truth, to which fallacies of the senses adjoin themselves, and to these the falsities that belong 
to the cupidities of the love of self and of the world. Such are the truths appertaining to man. How impure these are may be seen from the fact that such things are adjoined to them.  [2] But still 
the Lord conjoins Himself with man in these impure truths, for He animates and vivifies them with innocence and charity, and thereby forms conscience. The truths of conscience are various, that is, 
they are according to each person's religion; and these truths, provided they are not contrary to the goods of faith, the Lord will not do violence to, because the man has been imbued with them, and has 
regarded them as holy. The Lord breaks no one, but bends him, as may be seen from the fact that in every dogma within the church there are some who are being gifted with conscience, which conscience 
is a better one in proportion as its truths approach more closely to the genuine truths of faith. As conscience is formed from truths of faith of this kind, it is evident that it has been formed in 
the intellectual part of man, for it is the intellectual part that receives these truths; and therefore the Lord has miraculously separated this part from the will part-an arcanum not previously known, 
and concerning which see Part First (n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 1023). That a "covenant in your flesh" also denotes what is significative, namely, of purification, is evident from what has been shown in 
respect to circumcision in n. 2039. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2053</b></p><p><b>2053.</b>
'My covenant shall be in your flesh' means conjunction of the Lord with man in his impurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as conjunction, dealt with above, and from the meaning of 'flesh' 
as man's proprium, also dealt with above, in <a href="2041.htm">2041</a>. How impure the proprium is has also been stated in that paragraph, and has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="150.htm">150</a>, <a href="154.htm">154</a>, <a href="210.htm">210</a>, <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>, <a href="731.htm">731</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>, <a href="987.htm">987</a>, <a href="1047.htm">1047</a>. The implications of 'My covenant in your flesh' being the conjunction of the Lord with man in his impurity are as follows: No pure intellectual truth, which is Divine truth, resides with 
man. Instead the truths of faith residing with man are appearances of truth to which illusions of the senses attach themselves, and to these in turn falsities, belonging to the desires that go with 
self-love and love of the world. Such are the truths that reside with man. And how impure they are becomes clear from the fact that such illusions and falsities attach themselves to them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nevertheless 
the Lord joins Himself to man within those very impurities, for with innocence and charity He brings soul and life to these, and in this way forms a conscience. The truths that constitute conscience 
vary, that is to say, they depend on the religion of the individual. These truths the Lord is unwilling to violate provided they are not contrary to the goods of faith, because the person has 
taken them to himself and considered them holy. The Lord breaks nobody, but bends him. This becomes clear from the consideration that every type of religious thought in the Church has followers who 
are being endowed with conscience. The closer its truths get to the genuine truths of faith the better that conscience is. Since it is from the truths of faith such as this that conscience is formed, 
it is clear that it has been formed in the understanding part of man's mind, for the understanding part is what receives those truths. This part of his mind the Lord has therefore miraculously separated 
from the will part. This is an arcanum previously unknown, concerning which see what has appeared in Volume One, in <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>. That 'covenant in your flesh' in addition denotes a meaningful 
sign, namely that of purification, is clear from what has been shown in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a> about circumcision. </p>

`Erit foedus Meum in carne vestra': quod significet conjunctionem Domini cum homine in ejus impuritate, constat ex significatione `foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua supra; et ex significatione `carnis' 
quod sit proprium hominis, de qua etiam supra n. 2041; proprium quam impurum sit, ibi quoque dictum, et in Parte Prima ostensum n. 141, 150, 154, 210, 215, 694, 731, 874, 875, 876, 987, 1047. 
 Quod `foedus Meum in carne vestra' sit conjunctio Domini cum homine in ejus impuritate, ita se habet: apud hominem non datur aliquod verum intellectuale purum, hoc est, verum Divinum, sed vera fidei 
quae apud hominem, sunt apparentiae veri, quibus se adjungunt fallaciae quae sunt sensuum, et his falsa quae sunt cupiditatum amoris sui et mundi; talia vera apud hominem sunt, quae quam impura sunt constare 
potest ex eo quod iis adjuncta sint talia; [2] sed usque Dominus se conjungit cum homine in istis impuris, illa enim animat et vivificat innocentia et charitate et sic format conscientiam; vera 
conscientiae sunt varia, nempe secundum cujusvis religionem, quae violare Dominus non vult quia homo illis imbutus est et sanctitatem in illis posuit, modo non sint contraria bonis fidei; (m)Dominus 
neminem frangit sed flectit; quod constare exinde {1} potest, quod in unoquovis dogmate intra Ecclesiam sint qui conscientia donantur, quae usque eo melior est, quo vera ejus proprius accedunt ad vera 
genuina fidei; quia ex veris fidei ejuscemodi formatur conscientia, constat quod illa formata sit in parte hominis intellectuali, nam pars intellectualis est quae recipit illa; quam partem ideo Dominus 
miraculose separavit a parte voluntaria; quod est arcanum prius non notum, de quo videantur quae in Parte Prima, n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 1023(n). Quod `foedus in carne vestra' etiam significativum 
sit, nempe purificationis, constat ab illis quae de circumcisione n. 2039 ostensa sunt. 	@1 inde.$ </p>
