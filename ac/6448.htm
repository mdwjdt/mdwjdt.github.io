<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6448节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6448.</strong>“他祝福了他们，都是按着各人的福分，为他们祝福”表关于处于这种状态的每个人的属灵生命必遇之事的预言。这从“祝福”和“都是按着各人的福分，为他们祝福”的含义清楚可知：“祝福”是指预言（参看<a href="6230.htm">6230</a>，<a href="6254.htm">6254</a>节）；“都是按着各人的福分，为他们祝福”是指每个人必遇之事。所预言的事与处于这种状态的每个人的属灵生命有关，这一点从本章关于以色列的儿子们，或以他们命名的众支派的阐述明显看出来；因为他们用来描述就良善与真理，因而就教会中的每个人的属灵生命而言，教会的一切状态。</p>

And blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. That this signifies predictions as to the spiritual life, of what would happen to each one in such a state, is evident from the 
signification of "blessing," as being prediction (see n. 6230, 6254); and from the signification of "every one according to his blessing he blessed them," as being what would happen to each one. That 
it is as to the spiritual life of each one in such a state, is plain from all that has been said in this chapter of the sons of Israel or the tribes named from them; for by them are described all states 
of the church as to goods and truths, thus as to the spiritual life of everyone within the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6448</b></p><p><b>6448.</b>
'And he blessed them, each according to his blessing he blessed them' means foretellings about what was going to happen to each one's spiritual life when they entered that state. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'blessing' as foretelling, dealt with in <a href="6230.htm">6230</a>, <a href="6254.htm">6254</a>; and from the meaning of 'each according to his blessing he blessed them' as what was going to happen to each one. The fact that what 
is foretold has to do with each one's spiritual life when they entered that state is evident from all that has been stated in the present chapter regarding Israel's sons or the tribes named after them; 
for they are used to describe all states of the Church so far as forms of good and truth are concerned, thus so far as the spiritual life of everyone in the Church is concerned. </p>

</p><b>6448.</b>
`Et benedixit illis, cuique quod secundum benedictionem ejus benedixit illis':  quod significet praedictiones de vita spirituali quid eveniret cuique cum in tali statu, constat ex significatione `benedicere' 
quod sit praedictio, de qua n.  6230, 6254; et ex significatione `cuique quod secundum benedictionem ejus benedixit illis' quod sit quid eveniret cuique {1}; quod sit de vita spirituali quae 
cuivis in tali statu, patet ab omnibus illis quae de filiis Israelis seu tribubus ab illis nominatis in hoc capite dicta sunt; {2}describuntur enim per illos omnes status Ecclesiae quoad bona et vera 
ita quoad vitam spiritualem cujusvis intra Ecclesiam. @1 i nam hoc praedictionis, quod per benedictionem significatur$ @2 describitur$ </p>
