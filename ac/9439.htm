<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9439节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9439.</strong>在当今教会，大人数人对死后的生命没有真正的信仰，几乎不信天堂或作为天地之神的主。因此，我灵的内层被主打开，好叫我在肉身中的同时，也与天堂天使同在，不仅与他们交谈，还看到那里令人惊叹的事物，并描述它们。这是为了防止今后有人会说，有谁从天堂来到我们这里告诉我们天堂的存在，以及那里有什么东西？不过，我意识到，那些早就从心里否认天堂和地狱，以及死后生命存在的人仍将刚硬，完全不接受这些事，拒绝相信它们。因为把乌鸦变成白的，都比让那些从心里逐出信仰的人去相信某些事容易得多。不过，到目前为止关于天堂和地狱，以及死后生命所说的这些事就当是为了那些处于信仰的少数人。然而，至于其他人，为叫他们能被引向对这些事的某种认识，我被恩准提及一些满足和吸引好奇心的那类细节。即将讲述的细节涉及宇宙中的诸星球。</p>

As, with most in the church at this day, there is no faith in the life after death, and scarcely any in heaven, or in the Lord as being the God of heaven and earth; therefore the interiors of my spirit 
have been opened by the Lord, so that I may, while in the body, be at the same time with the angels in heaven, and not only speak with them, but also see there amazing things, and describe the same; 
lest perchance hereafter people may say, Who has come to us from heaven, and told us that it exists, and what there is there? But I know that those who have previously at heart denied a heaven and a 
hell, and the life after death, will still harden themselves against them, and will deny them; for it is easier to make a raven white, than to cause those to believe who have once at heart rejected faith. 
But let the things which have thus far been shown concerning heaven and hell and the life after death, be for those few who are in faith. That the rest, however, may be brought to something of acknowledgment, 
it has been granted that I should relate such things as delight and attract the man who is desirous of having knowledge; and which at present shall be about the earths in the universe. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9439</b></p><p><b>9439.</b>
The majority in the Church at the present day have no real belief regarding life after death, and scarcely any regarding heaven or regarding the Lord, that He is God of heaven and earth. For this reason 
the interiors of my own spirit have been opened by the Lord to enable me, while I am in the body, to be present at the same time with angels in heaven, and not only to talk to them but also to see 
the astonishing things there, and to describe them. This has happened to prevent people from saying from now on, Has anyone come to us from heaven and told us of its existence and about the things that 
are there? But I realize that those who at heart have already refused to believe in the existence of heaven and hell, or in life after death, will also be wholly unreceptive of those things and refuse 
to believe them. For it is easier to make a raven white than it is to cause people to believe something once they have at heart banished belief. But let those things which have been shown up to now 
regarding heaven and hell, and regarding life after death, be for the few in whom belief is present. As for everyone else however, in order that they may be led to some recognition of those things, 
I have been given consent to mention the kinds of details that gratify and attract the curious. Those that are about to be stated concern planets in the universe.  </p>

Quia hodie in Ecclesia apud plerosque nulla fides est de vita post mortem, et vix aliqua de caelo, nec de Domino quod sit Deus caeli et terrae, ideo interiora quae sunt spiritus mei a Domino aperta 
sunt ut possem, dum in corpore sum, simul cum angelis in caelo esse, et non modo loqui cum illis sed etiam ibi videre stupenda, et eadem describere; ne forte posthac etiam dicturi sint, Quis ex caelo 
ad nos venit et narravit quod sit, et quae ibi? Sed scio quod qui corde prius negaverunt caelum et infernum, ac vitam post mortem, etiam contra illa se obfirmaturi sint et negaturi; nam facilius est corvum 
album facere quam (x)efficere ut credant qui semel corde rejecerunt fidem; {5}sint vero haec quae de caelo et inferno, deque vita post mortem, hactenus ostensa sunt, pro paucis illis qui in fide 
sunt; ut autem reliqui {6} perducantur ad aliquid agnitionis, concessum est memorare talia quae delectant et allectant hominem sciendi cupidum; quae nunc erunt de telluribus in universo. @1 et$ @2
