<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第155节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>155.</strong>“一条肋骨建成一个女人”，这话隐藏着字面无从发现的奥秘。因为主的圣言在核心处是论及主和他的国，圣言的生命力即源于此。故此，本段经文在核心处是论及属天的婚姻。<br />属天的婚姻发生于人的自我中，当人的自我被主赋予生气以后，就被称为主的“新妇”。获得生气的自我能觉知一切爱之良善和信之真理，故能拥有一切智慧聪明，享受无法言说的幸福。<br />这称为主的“新妇”的被赋予了生气的自我，其性质无法简单地作出说明，只需明了，天使能觉知自己是凭主而活，虽然他们在不作观想时，也感觉是凭自己而活。他们有一种共通的意识，使他们一偏离爱之良善和信之真理，就立刻感受到变化。因此，当他们觉知自己是凭主而活时，就享受无法言说的平安和快乐。耶利米说：“耶和华在地上造了一件新事，就是一个女子将环绕一个男子。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.22.htm">31:22</a>）即是指被主赋予了生气的自我，也是指属天的婚姻，其中一个“女子”表被主赋予了生气的自我。经上说它“环绕”一个男子，因为它环绕着自我，正如合上肉的肋骨环绕着心脏。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]155.</strong> The words a woman was built out of a rib conceal more than anyone can ever see in the literal meaning, since the Lord's Word is such that deep down it concerns itself with the Lord himself and his kingdom. This is the source of all life in the Word. In the same vein, the inmost concern here is the heavenly marriage.{*1} The heavenly marriage is something that exists in our selfhood. Moreover, it is because of the heavenly marriage that our selfhood, after being brought to life by the Lord, is called the Lord's bride and wife.<br />When the Lord brings it to life, our sense of self gives us the ability to perceive all the good desired by love and all the truth taught by faith. So it holds within it all wisdom and understanding, joined to an indescribable happiness.<br />Still, a few words will not be enough to explain the nature of this living autonomy called the Lord's bride and wife. I can offer only this much: that angels perceive that they live from the Lord, although when not reflecting, they are under the full impression that they live on their own. This living selfhood is a sensation affecting all of them, telling them something has changed whenever they depart in the least from a loving goodness and religious truth. They enjoy their customary peace and happiness, which defies description, when they share in a perception that they live from the Lord.<br />A living sense of self is also what Jeremiah refers to when he says,<br />Jehovah has created something new in the earth: a woman will encircle a man. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_22" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:22</a>)<br />This too is talking about the heavenly marriage, the woman symbolizing a sense of autonomy brought to life by the Lord. She is said to encircle the man because our self-life encircles us as the fleshed-out rib encircles the heart.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The theme of the heavenly marriage occurs frequently in the Christian tradition. The source of this metaphor lies in the Old Testament, which portrayed Israel as the bride of the Lord: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/bible_king-james-version_hosea_1_1-11" target=_top>Hosea 1</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/bible_king-james-version_hosea_3_1-5" target=_top>3</a> depicts Israel as a faithless wife, and the Song of Songs was from an early time regarded as an allegory of love between God and Israel (Schmithals 1997, 166-167). In the New Testament, Revelation describes "the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of the sky, prepared as a bride dressed up for her husband" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_2" target=_top>Revelation 21:2</a>). The "bride" is "the Lamb's wife" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_9" target=_top>Revelation 21:9</a>; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_253" target=_top>253</a>). The union between Christ and the Church is thus portrayed as a heavenly marriage. In the Western esoteric tradition, this metaphor has a meaning closer to Swedenborg's, where the spiritual element is the Lord, and the physical "self" is the bride. See also note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54" target=_top>54</a>. [RS] </p>

The words "a rib was built into a woman" have more things inmostly concealed in them than it is possible for anyone ever to discover from the letter; for the Word of the Lord is such that its inmost 
contents regard the Lord Himself and His kingdom, and from this comes all the life of the Word. And so in the passage before us, it is the heavenly marriage that is regarded in its inmost contents. The 
heavenly marriage is of such a nature that it exists in the Own, which, when vivified by the Lord, is called the "bride and wife" of the Lord. Man's Own thus vivified has a perception of all the good 
of love and truth of faith, and consequently possesses all wisdom and intelligence conjoined with inexpressible happiness. But the nature of this vivified Own, which is called the "bride and wife" of 
the Lord, cannot be concisely explained. Suffice it therefore to observe that the angels perceive that they live from the Lord, although when not reflecting on the subject they know no other than that 
they live from themselves; but there is a general affection of such a nature that at the least departure from the good of love and truth of faith they perceive a change, and consequently they are in 
the enjoyment of their peace and happiness, which is inexpressible, while they are in their general perception that they live from the Lord. It is this Own also that is meant in Jeremiah, where it is 
said: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man (Jer. 31:22) It is the heavenly marriage that is signified in this passage also, where by a "woman" is meant the 
Own vivified by the Lord, of which woman the expression "to compass" is predicated, because this Own is such that it encompasses, as a rib made flesh encompasses the heart. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 155</b></p><p><b>155.</b>
These words, 'a rib was built into a woman', conceal, inmostly, more than anyone can possibly know from the letter. For the Word of the Lord is such that inmostly it focuses on the Lord Himself and His 
kingdom. This is the source of a <a href="11.htm">11</a> the life of the Word. Here likewise it is the heavenly marriage that is focused inmostly. Such is the nature of the heavenly marriage that it exists within the proprium, 
and such is its nature that a proprium given life by the Lord is called the Lord's Bride, and also Wife. The proprium given life in this way by the Lord is enabled to perceive every good that 
stems from love, and every truth of faith. It therefore possesses all wisdom and intelligence coupled with an indescribable happiness.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the nature of this proprium - the Lord's Bride and Wife 
- that has been given life cannot be described in a few words. Let just this be said, that angels perceive that they live from the Lord, and yet when not reflecting on the matter they have no other 
idea than that they live from themselves. But there is a universal affection by which they sense that a change has taken place when they retreat only slightly from the good that stems from love, or 
from the truth of faith. Consequently they experience a peace and happiness that is indescribable when the general perception exists with them that they live from the Lord. It is this proprium too that 
is meant in Jeremiah, where it is said,   Jehovah has created a new thing on the earth, a woman will surround a man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:12</a>.   It is the heavenly marriage that is meant in this quotation too, 
the 'woman' meaning the proprium given life by the Lord. The woman is said 'to surround', because the proprium by nature surrounds, just as a rib made flesh surrounds the heart.

</p><b>155.</b>
Verba haec, quod 'costa aedificata sit in mulierem,' plura intime recondita habent quam usquam aliquis ex littera scire potest; nam Verbum Domini tale est ut in intimis spectet Ipsum Dominum, ac regnum 
Ipsius, inde vita omnis Verbi; hic similiter, est conjugium caeleste, quod in intimis spectatur.  Conjugium caeleste est tale quod sit in proprio, et quod proprium vivificatum a Domino dicatur Domini 
Sponsa, ut et Uxor: proprium ita vivificatum a Domino habet perceptionem omnis boni amoris et veri fidei; ita habet omnem sapientiam et intelligentiam conjunctam cum ineffabili felicitate: sed quale 
hoc proprium vivificatum quod dicitur Sponsa et Uxor Domini, non paucis dici potest; solum quod angeli percipiant quod vivant a Domino, et cum non reflectunt, non aliter sciant quam quod ex se; sed 
est communis affectio, quae talis est ut dum vel minimum a bono amoris et vero fidei recedunt, percipiant mutationem; quare in sua pace et felicitate, quae ineffabilis est, sunt, quando in perceptione 
communi quod a Domino vivant. Hoc proprium quoque est quod intelligitur apud Jeremiam, ubi dicitur, </p>
<p>Creavit Jehovah novam in terra, mulier circumdabit virum, xxxi 22; </p>
<p>est conjugium caeleste quod 
hic quoque significatur, et per 'mulierem' proprium vivificatum a Domino, de qua muliere praedicatur 'circumdare'; nam proprium tale est ut circumdet, sicut costa facta caro circumdat cor. </p>
