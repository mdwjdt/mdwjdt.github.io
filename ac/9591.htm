From all this it can be seen what Free Will is, namely, that is to do what is good from choice, or from the will; and that they are in this Freedom who are led by the Lord. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 26 </p>
<p>     
1. And thou shalt make the Habitation, ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, with cherubs, the work of a thinker,* shalt thou make them.      2. The length 
of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits; and the breadth four cubits, for one curtain; one measure for all the curtains.      3. Five curtains shall be joined together one to the other; and 
five curtains shall be joined together one to the other.      4. And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain at the extremity in the joining, and so shalt thou do in the edge 
of the uttermost curtain in the second joining.      5. Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the extremity of the curtain that is in the second joining; 
the loops shall be taken up one to the other.      6. And thou shalt make fifty hooks of gold, and shalt join together the curtains one to the other in the hooks, and it shall be one Habitation.   
   7. And thou shalt make curtains of goats' [hair] for a Tent over the Habitation; eleven curtains shalt thou make them.      8. The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth four 
cubits, for one curtain; one measure for the eleven curtains.      9. And thou shalt join together five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain over 
against the faces of the Tent.      10. And thou shalt make fifty loops upon the edge of the one uttermost curtain in the joining, and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain of the second joining.  
    11. And thou shalt make fifty hooks of brass, and shalt bring the hooks into the loops, and shalt join together the Tent, that it may be one.      12. And that which superaboundeth over and 
above in the curtains of the Tent, the half of the curtain that is over and above, thou shalt make to superabound over the hinder parts of the Habitation.      13. And the cubit on the one side, and 
the cubit on the other side, in that which is over and above in the length of the curtains of the Tent, shall superabound over the sides of the Habitation, on this side and on that, to cover it.     
 14. And thou shalt make for the Tent a covering of skins of red rams, and a covering of badgers' skins above.      15. And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation of shittim wood, standing up.  
    16. Ten cubits shall be the length of a plank, and a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank.      17. Two hands shall there be in one plank, combined one to the other: thus shalt thou 
make for all the planks of the Habitation.      18. And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation, twenty planks for the corner of the south toward the south.      19. And thou shalt make forty 
bases of silver under the twenty planks; two bases under one plank for its two hands, and two bases under one plank for its two hands.      20. And for the other side of the Habitation, at the corner 
of the north, twenty planks: </p>
<p>     21. And their forty bases of silver; two bases under one plank, and two bases under one plank.      22. And for the two legs of the Habitation toward the sea thou 
shalt make six planks.      23. And two planks shalt thou make for the corners of the Habitation in the two legs.      24. And they shall be twinned from beneath, and they shall be twinned together 
at the head of it unto one ring; thus shall it be for them both; they shall be at the two corners.      25. And there shall be eight planks, and their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under 
one plank, and two bases under one plank.      26. And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the planks of the one side of the Habitation: </p>
<p>     27. And five bars for the planks of the other 
side of the Habitation, and five bars for the planks of the side of the Habitation at the two legs toward the sea.      28. And the middle bar in the middle of the planks shall pass through from extremity 
to extremity.      29. And thou shalt overlay the planks with gold, and make their rings of gold, houses for the bars; and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.      30. And thou shalt set 
up the Habitation according to the method which thou wast made to see in the mountain.      31. And thou shalt make a veil of blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen; with the 
work of a thinker* shall he make it, with cherubs: </p>
<p>     32. And thou shalt bestow it upon four pillars of shittim overlaid with gold, and their hooks of gold, upon four bases of silver.      33. 
And thou shalt bestow the veil under the hooks, and shalt bring in thither from within the veil the ark of the Testimony; and the veil shall divide for you between the holy and the holy of holies.   
   34. And thou shalt bestow the propitiatory [mercy seat] upon the ark of the Testimony in the holy of holies.      35. And thou shalt put the table outside the veil, and the lampstand over against 
the table upon the side of the Habitation toward the south; and thou shalt bestow the table at the side of the north.      36. And thou shalt make a covering for the door of the Tent, of blue, and crimson, 
and scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer.      37. And thou shalt make for the covering five pillars of shittim, and overlay them with gold; and their hooks 
shall be of gold; and thou shalt cast for them five bases of brass. * skilled craftsman </p>
