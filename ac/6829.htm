<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6829节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6829.</strong>“到了神的山”表然后，神之爱的良善向他显现。这从“神的山”的含义清楚可知，“神的山”是指神之爱的良善。“山”是指爱之良善（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>，<a href="6435.htm">6435</a>节）。他到了旷野后面的那山就表示他们经历试探之后，这良善显现。此中情形是这样：当人经历试探时，他被邪恶和虚假围困，这些邪恶和虚假阻挡来自神性的光之流注，也就是真理与良善的流注；这时，此人可以说陷入黑暗。在来世，黑暗无非是虚假的围困，因为这些虚假从经历试探的人那里夺走光，从而夺走真理所带来的安慰的感觉。但当此人从试探当中走出来时，光及其属灵之热，也就是真理及其良善就会一起显现。这人由此在焦虑、痛苦之后获得快乐；在来世，这种快乐就是黑夜过后到来的早晨。那时之所以良善感觉得到，真理显现，是因为试探过后，真理与良善会渗透到内层，在那里深深扎下根来。事实上，当一个人经历试探时，可以说他渴求良善，渴望真理；因此，当他从试探当中走出来时，就会吸收良善，如同一个饥饿的人狼吞虎咽，领受真理，如同一个干渴的人鲸吸牛饮。此外，当来自神性的光显现时，虚假与邪恶就被移除；一旦它们被移除，向里更深地渗透之路就向真理与良善打开。这些就是试探过后，爱之良善及其来自主的光一同显现的原因。在来世，众所周知，试探的模糊和焦虑，或说幽暗和痛苦过后，光明和快乐就会出现，因为这是那里的普遍现象。</p>

And came to the mountain of God. That this signifies that the good of love Divine then appeared, is evident from the signification of the "mountain of God," as being the good of love Divine. (That a 
"mountain" is the good of love, see n. 795, 796, 2722, 4210, 6435.) That this good appeared after they had undergone temptations, is signified by his coming to that mountain behind the wilderness. The 
case herein is this. When a man is in temptation, he is beset round by falsities and evils which impede the influx of light from the Divine, that is, the influx of truth and good, and then the man is 
as it were in darkness. Darkness in the other life is nothing else than this besetment by falsities, for these take away the light from the man who is in temptation, and thus the perception of consolation 
by truths. But when the man emerges from temptation, then the light appears with its spiritual heat, that is, truth with its good, and from this he has gladness after anxiety. This is the morning 
which in the other life follows the night. The reason why good is then perceived, and truth appears, is that after temptation truth and good penetrate toward the interiors, and there take root. For 
when a man is in temptation, he is as it were in hunger for good, and in thirst for truth; and therefore when he emerges he draws in good as a hungry man devours food, and receives truth as a thirsty 
man imbibes drink. Moreover, when light from the Divine appears, falsities and evils are removed, and when these are removed, the way is opened for truth and good to penetrate more interiorly. These are 
the reasons why after temptations the good of love appears with its light from the Lord. That after the obscurity and anxiety of temptations, brightness and gladness appear, is known to all in the 
other life, because it is there a common occurrence. </p>

'And came to the mountain of God' means that after them the good of God's love appeared. This is clear from the meaning of 'the mountain of God' as the good of God's love, 'mountain' being the good of 
love, see <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>, <a href="6435.htm">6435</a>. The appearance of that good after they had undergone temptations is what is meant by his coming to that mountain at the back of the wilderness. The situation is 
that when a person undergoes temptation he is besieged all round by falsities and evils which block the flow of light from the Divine, that is, of truth and good; and that person is so to speak in darkness. 
Darkness in the next life is nothing other than being besieged by falsities, for these take away the light and so take away from the one undergoing temptation any sense of consolation gained from 
truths. But when the person comes out of temptation light appears together with the spiritual heat that goes with it, that is, truth together with the good that goes with it. This brings the person 
cheerfulness after his distress; and that cheerfulness is the morning that follows night in the next life. The reason why good is perceived then and truth appears is that after temptation truth and 
good penetrate more deeply within and become firmly rooted. For while a person undergoes temptation he so to speak hungers for good and thirsts for truth, and therefore when he comes out of temptation 
he takes in good like one hungry for food and receives truth like one thirsting for drink. And in addition to this, when the light from the Divine appears falsities and evils are removed; and once they 
have been removed there is a means of access for truth and good to penetrate more deeply within. These are the reasons why after temptations the good of love appears together with the light from the 
Lord that goes with it. It is well known to everyone in the next life that brightness and cheerfulness appear after the gloom and distress of temptations, because this is a common happening there.  </p>

`Et venit ad montem Dei': quod significet quod bonum amoris Divini dein appareret, constat ex significatione `montis Dei' quod sit bonum amoris Divini; quod `mons' sit bonum amoris, videatur n. 795, 
796, 2725, 4210, (x)6435; quod id bonum appareret postquam subierunt tentationes, significatur per quod veniret ad illum montem post desertum.  Cum hoc (t)ita se habet: cum homo est in tentatione, {1} 
circum obsessus est a falsis et malis quae impediunt influxum lucis a Divino, hoc est, veri et boni, est {2}homo tunc quasi in tenebris; tenebrae in altera vita non aliud sunt quam {3}obsessio a falsis, 
nam haec demunt lucem, {4}ac ita perceptionem consolationis a veris ei qui in tentatione est; cum autem homo ex tentatione emergit, tunc apparet {5} lux cum suo calore spirituali, hoc est, verum 
cum suo bono; inde ei laetum post anxium; hoc est mane quod succedit nocti in altera vita; causa quod tunc percipiatur bonum et appareat verum, est quia {6}post tentationem verum et bonum versus interiora 
penetrant et irradicantur; cum enim homo in tentatione {7}est, est quasi in fame boni et in siti veri {8}, quare cum emergit, haurit bonum sicut esuriens cibum, et recipit verum sicut sitiens potum; 
et praeterea cum lux a Divino apparet, falsa et mala removentur, quibus remotis est aditus vero et bono {9} interius penetrandi; hae causae sunt quod post tentationes appareat bonum amoris cum sua 
luce a Domino. Quod post obscurum et anxium tentationum appareat lucidum et laetum, quia commune est in altera vita, omnibus ibi notum est. 	@1 i quia$ 	@2 is$ 	@3 falsa$ 	@4 hoc est,$ 	@5 i ei$ 	@6
