<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10232节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10232</strong>.“为你们的灵魂赎罪”表因为邪恶以这种方式被移走。这从“为他们的灵魂赎罪”的含义清楚可知，“为他们的灵魂赎罪”是指通过真理移走邪恶（参看<a href="10228.htm">10228</a>节）。此处“为你们的灵魂赎罪”之所以表示因为邪恶以这种方式被移走，而不是为了将邪恶移走，是因为这种移走跟随前面那些话所表示的事之后发生。因为内义不是照着文字上的连贯性，而是照着它自己的含义，即内义的连贯性而关注这些话的含义，也就是说，对教会和教会所拥有的一切的保存是由主来完成的，因为邪恶以这种方式被移走。与人同在的教会得以保存，是因为邪恶不再阻碍；事实上，主以其怜悯而持续不断地流入，并规定属于教会的真理和良善不仅在一个人身上得以保存，而且它们还繁殖、生长。然而，只要邪恶掌权，从主流入的教会的真理和良善被此人要么弃绝，要么扼杀，要么扭曲；而一旦邪恶被移走，它们就被接受和承认。</p>

To make expiation upon your souls. That this signifies because in this way evils are removed, is evident from the signification of "expiating upon their souls," as being to remove evils by means of truths 
(see above, n. 10228); that here by "making expiation upon your souls" is signified because in this way evils are removed, and not, to remove evils, is because these things so follow from those 
which precede; for the internal sense does not regard the sense of the words according to the consistency in the letter, but according to the consistency in its own sense, which is that the preservation 
of the church and of all things of the church is from the Lord, because in this way evils are removed. That the church is then preserved with man is because evils do not hinder; for the Lord flows 
in constantly and continually with His mercy, and provides that the truths and goods that belong to the church are not only preserved with a man, but also that they are multiplied and grow; but so long 
as evils reign, the truths and goods of the church flowing in from the Lord are either rejected by the man, or are stifled, or perverted; whereas when evils are removed, they are accepted and acknowledged. </p>

'To make expiation for your souls' means since evils have thereby been removed. This is clear from the meaning of 'making expiation for their souls' as removing evils by means of truths, dealt with above 
in <a href="10228.htm">10228</a>. The reason why the expression 'making expiation for your souls' here means since evils have thereby been removed, and not in order that evils may be removed, is that such removal follows 
those things meant in the words that come before it. For the internal sense has no regard to the meaning of words as they hang together in the letter, only as they hang together on its own level of 
meaning, which is that the preservation of the Church and of all things the Church has is done by the Lord, since evils have been removed. When the Church as it exists with the person is preserved it 
is because evils are not a hindrance; for the Lord flows in unceasingly and constantly with His mercy, making provision for the truths and forms of good which are the Church's not only to be preserved 
with the person but even to multiply and grow. As long as evils reign however, the Church's truths and forms of good flowing in from the Lord are either rejected, stifled, or perverted by the person; 
but once the evils have been removed they are accepted and acknowledged.  </p>

`Ad expiandum super animabus vestris': quod significet quoniam sic mala remota, constat ex significatione `expiare super animabus suis' quod sit removere mala per vera, de qua supra n. 10,228; quod 
hic per `expiandum super animabus vestris' significetur quoniam sic mala remota, et non ad removendum mala, est quia haec ita sequuntur ab illis quae praecedunt; sensus enim internus non spectat sensum 
verborum qualiter cohaeret in littera, sed qualiter cohaeret in suo sensu, qui est quod conservatio Ecclesiae et omnium Ecclesiae a Domino sit quoniam mala sunt remota; nam quod Ecclesia {1} apud hominem 
(x)conservetur, est quia mala non impediunt; influit enim Dominus jugiter et continue cum Sua Misericordia, et providet ut vera et bona quae sunt Ecclesiae, non modo conserventur apud hominem sed 
etiam ut multiplicentur {2}et crescant; sed quamdiu mala regnant, vera et bona {3}Ecclesiae influentia a Domino, ab homine vel rejiciuntur, vel suffocantur, vel pervertuntur; {4}ast remotis malis acceptantur 
et agnoscuntur. @1 i in communi et in particulari$ @2 ut IT$ @3 quae influunt$ @4 at$ </p>
