<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7889节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7889.</strong>“灵魂必从以色列中剪除”表他将与那些属于属灵教会的人分离，并受到诅咒。这从“剪除”的停留和“以色列人”的含义清楚可知：“剪除”是指被分离，以及受到诅咒；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述。拥有虚假在良善中的人之所以必须被分离并受到诅咒，是因为在良善里面的虚假（这虚假由“无酵之物”来表示）使得这良善具有这样一种品质：它不得不接受来自施加诅咒的地狱的邪恶。当那些属于属灵教会的人将要从那些侵扰他们的人那里得以释放时，诅咒就会从四面八方进入；那些处于纯正良善，也就是处于没有虚假的良善之人会安然无恙地通过诅咒中间（参看<a href="7878.htm">7878</a>节）。</p>

Even that soul shall be cut off from Israel. That this signifies that he shall be separated from those who are of the spiritual church and that he shall be damned, is evident from the signification of 
"to be cut off," as being to be separated and also damned; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which frequently above). The reason why 
he must be separated and damned who has falsity in good, is that falsity (which is signified by "what is leavened") in the good, makes it of such a quality that it cannot but receive evil from the 
hells which inflict damnation. (When those of the spiritual church are to be liberated from those who have infested, that then damnation will flow in from all sides, and that they who are in genuine good, 
that is, in good without falsity, will pass safe through the midst of damnation, see above, n. 7878.) </p>

'That soul shall be cut off from Israel' means that he will be separated from those belonging to the spiritual Church, and that he will be damned. This is clear from the meaning of 'being cut off' as 
being separated and also as being damned; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with often. The reason why anyone who has falsity in 
his good will be separated and will be damned is that falsity - meant by 'anything made with yeast' - within good renders that good such that it cannot help receiving evil from the hells that inflict 
damnation. For when [those belonging to the spiritual Church] are to be delivered from the ones who have molested them, damnation will enter in from every side; and those who are governed by genuine 
good, which is good devoid of falsity, will pass unharmed through the midst of the damnation, see above in <a href="7878.htm">7878</a>. </p>

</p><b>7889.</b>
`Et exscindetur anima illa ex Israele': quod significet quod separabitur ab illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, et quod erit damnatus, constat ex significatione `exscindi' quod sit separari et quoque 
damnari; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua saepe; causa quod separabitur et erit damnatus is cui in bono est falsum, est quia falsum, quod significatur 
per `fermentatum,' in bono, facit illud tale ut non possit non recipere malum ab infernis quae (t)damnationem inferunt; quando liberandi ab illis qui infestarunt, quod tunc damnatio influet 
ab undique, et quod illi qui in genuino bono sunt seu in bono absque falso, per mediam damnationem incolumes transibunt, videatur supra n. 7878. </p>
