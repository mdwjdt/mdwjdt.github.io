<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2284节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2284．“假若在那里找到十个呢”表若仍有余留存在。这从数字“十”的含义清楚可知，“十”是指余留，如第一卷所解释的（<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>节）。至于何为余留，这在前面各处有所阐述和说明（如<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>节），也就是说，它们是人所具有的、储存在他的记忆和生命中的一切良善和一切真理。<br />众所周知，若非来自主，就没有任何良善与真理；而且，良善与真理不断从主流入人里面，但却以各种方式被接受，事实上，照着邪恶的生命和这人所确认的虚假原则被接受。这些东西要么熄灭、要么窒息、要么滥用不断从主所流入的良善与真理。因此，为免良善与邪恶混和，真理与虚假混和（因为若它们混和，这人必永远灭亡），主便将它们分开，并将这人所接受的良善与真理储存在他的内层人中。只要此人活在邪恶与虚假中，主就绝不允许它们从那里出来，除非在这种时候，如他处于神圣状态，或某种焦虑、病患，以及其它困境之时。主如此储存在此人里面的这些事物就是所谓的“余留”。余留在圣言中被大量提及，但至今没有人知道这就是它们的意思。<br />在来世，人照着余留，也就是良善和真理的性质和数量而享受幸福快乐。因为如前所述，这些余留被储存在他的内层人中，等到这人丢下肉体和世俗之物，它们就被打开。唯独主知道人里面余留的性质和数量，而这人自己绝不可能知道这一切。所以，现在的人具有这样的秉性，即：他能假装良善，而里面却只有邪恶；还有可能看似邪恶，却有良善在里面。由于这些原因，人绝不可论断别人的属灵生活的性质。因为如前所述，唯独主知道这一切。不过，人可以论断别人的道德、文明生活的性质，因为这对社会有重要意义。<br />那些对某个信之真理形成定见的人经常论断别人，声称他们不会得救，除非其信仰与他们的一致，这种论断是主所禁止的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.1.htm">7:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.2.htm">2</a>）。另一方面，我通过大量经历得知，各个宗教的成员只要已通过仁爱的生活接受良善的余留和真理的表象，就都会得救。这就是经上说“假若找到十个，为这十个的缘故，他们也不会被毁灭”所表示的，也就是说，若余留存在，他们就会得救。<br />仁爱的生命就在于对别人心怀善念，祝福他，并为别人也能得救而感到由衷地喜悦。而那些没有仁爱生命的人渴望除了那些与自己信仰一致的人外，无人得救。那些若非如此就感到愤愤不平的人尤其如此。这一点仅从以下事实就能看出来，即得救的外邦人多于得救的基督徒。因为在来世，那些对邻人心怀善念并祝福他的外邦人比所谓的基督徒能更好地接受信之真理，并且比基督徒更承认主。因为对天使来说，再没有比教导那些从尘世进入来世的人更快乐、更幸福的了。</p>

Peradventure ten shall be found there. That this signifies if there should still be remains, is evident from the signification of the number "ten," as being remains (explained in volume 1, n. 576, 1738). 
What remains are has been stated and shown before in various places (as in n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 1050, 1738, 1906), namely, that they are all the good and all the truth with man which 
lie stored up in his memories and in his life. [2] It is well known that there is nothing good and nothing true, except from the Lord; and also that what is good and true is continually inflowing from 
the Lord into man, but that it is received in various ways, and in fact in accordance with the life of evil, and in accordance with the principles of falsity in which the man has confirmed himself. 
These are what either quench, or stifle, or pervert the goods and truths that are continually flowing in from the Lord. Lest therefore goods should be commingled with evils, and truths with falsities 
(for if they were commingled the man would perish eternally), the Lord separates them, and stores up in his interior man the goods and truths which the man receives; whence He will never permit them to 
come forth so long as the man is in evil and falsity, but only at such a time as he is in a holy state, or in some anxiety, sickness, or other trouble. These things which the Lord has thus stored up 
with man are what are called "remains," of which very much mention is made in the Word; but it has not yet been known to anyone that this is what they signify. [3] According to the quality and quantity 
of the remains-that is, of the good and truth with a man-does he enjoy bliss and happiness in the other life; for, as has been said, these remains are stored up in his interior man, and they are opened 
at the time when the man has left corporeal and worldly things behind. The Lord alone knows the quality and extent of the remains in a man; the man himself cannot possibly know this, for at the 
present day man is of such a character that he is able to counterfeit what is good, while within there is nothing but evil; and a man may also appear to be evil and yet have good within. On this account 
no man is ever allowed to judge concerning the quality of the spiritual life of another, for the Lord alone, as before said, knows this; but everyone may judge of another in regard to the quality of 
his moral and civil life, for this concerns society. [4] It is very common for those who have taken up an opinion respecting any truth of faith, to judge of others that they cannot be saved, unless 
they believe as they do-a judgment which the Lord has forbidden (Matt. 7:1-2). On the other hand, I have learned from much experience that men of every religion are saved, provided that by a life of 
charity they have received remains of good and of apparent truth. This is what is meant by its being said that if ten were found, they should not be destroyed for the ten's sake; by which is signified 
that they would be saved if there were remains. [5] The life of charity consists in thinking kindly of another, and in wishing him well; and in perceiving joy in oneself from the fact that others also 
are saved. But those have not the life of charity who desire that none should be saved except those who believe as they do; and especially is this the case with those who are indignant that it is otherwise. 
This may be seen from the mere fact that more from the Gentiles are saved than from Christians; for those Gentiles who have thought kindly of their neighbor and have wished well to him, receive 
the truths of faith in the other life better than those who are called Christians, and acknowledge the Lord more than Christians do. For nothing is more delightful and blessed to the angels than to 
instruct those who come from the earth into the other life. </p>

'Perhaps ten will be found there' means if remnants were still present. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'ten' as remnants, dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>. What remnants are however 
has been stated and shown in various places already, as in <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>,<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>,<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>,<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, namely that they are all the good and all the truth with a person which lie stored away in his 
two memories and in his life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is well known that there is nothing good nor anything true except that from the Lord; also that what is good and true is flowing in constantly from the Lord into 
man, but it is received in varying ways, and that in fact it is received according to the life of evil and according to the false assumptions in which the person has confirmed himself. These are what 
either annihilate, or stifle, or pervert the goods and truths flowing in constantly from the Lord. To prevent goods being mixed with evils therefore, and truths with falsities - for if they were mixed 
a person would perish for ever- the Lord separates them, and stores away within his interior man the goods and truths he receives. From there the Lord will never allow them to come forth as long 
as that person is governed by evil and falsity, except at those times when the person has entered some state that is a holy state, or when deeply and anxiously concerned about something, or in times of 
sickness, or other similar circumstances. These things which the Lord has so stored away in the person are what are called remnants, and of which very much mention is made in the Word, though nobody 
as yet knows that this is what they mean. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is according to the nature and the amount of the remnants, that is, of the good and truth residing with him, that a person experiences blessedness 
and happiness in the next life, for, as has been stated, such remnants are stored away in his interior man and are laid bare when he leaves things of a bodily and worldly nature behind him. The Lord alone 
knows the nature and the amount of remnants a person has. The person himself cannot possibly know this, for at the present day man is such that he is able to counterfeit what is good while within 
there is nothing but evil. A person can also appear to be evil and yet may have good within. For these reasons one is never allowed to judge the nature of another person's spiritual life; for the Lord 
alone, as has been stated, knows this. But one is allowed to judge the nature of another person's life, private and public, since this is of importance to society. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is very common for those 
who have adopted an opinion regarding any truth of faith to sit in judgement on others and to say that they cannot be saved unless their beliefs coincide with their own - a judgement which the Lord has 
forbidden, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7: 1, 2</a>. Yet from much experience I have been led to know that members of every religion are saved provided that they have received through a life of charity remnants of good and 
appearances of truth. This is what was meant by 'if ten were found [there] they would not be destroyed for the sake of the ten', that is, that if remnants were present they would be saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The 
life of charity consists in thinking what is good in regard to another, and in willing for him that which is good, and in feeling joy within oneself that others as well are saved. But those people do 
not possess the life of charity whose will is that no others should be saved than those whose beliefs coincide with theirs, especially those who are indignant that the situation is otherwise. This becomes 
clear solely from the fact that more gentiles are saved than Christians. For people who have thought what is good in regard to their neighbour and have willed for him that which is good accept 
the truths of faith in the next life more readily than those who called themselves Christians; and they acknowledge the Lord more than Christians do. Indeed nothing gives angels greater delight and happiness 
than to be teaching those who pass from the world into the next life. </p>

`Forte inventi fuerint ibi decem': quod significet si reliquiae usque essent, constat a significatione numeri `decem' quod sint reliquiae, de qua in Parte Prima n. 576, 1738; quid autem reliquiae sunt, 
in variis locis prius, ut n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 1050, 1738, 1906 dictum et ostensum est, nempe quod sit omne bonum et omne verum apud hominem quod reconditum latet in ejus memoriis, et 
in ejus vita; [2] notum est quod nihil bonum et nihil verum nisi a Domino; tum quod bonum et verum continue a Domino apud hominem influat, sed quod recipiatur diversimode; et quidem hoc secundum vitam 
mali, `et secundum principia falsi, in quibus se homo confirmavit; haec sunt quae bona et vera a Domino continue influentia vel exstinguunt, vel suffocant, vel pervertunt; ne itaque bona malis et vera 
falsis commisceantur, si enim commiscerentur, periret homo in aeternum, Dominus separat illa, et bona ac vera quae accepit, recondit in interiore ejus homine, unde Dominus nusquam permittet ut prodeant 
(quamdiu in malo et falso est, sed tunc solum cum in aliquo statu sancto est {1}, vel in quadam anxietate, vel {2} in morbis, et similibus; haec quae Dominus ita recondidit apud hominem, sunt quae 
vocantur `reliquiae,' quarum mentio plurima fit in Verbo, sed nondum alicui notum, quod illa significent; [3] homo secundum qualitatem et quantitatem reliquiarum, hoc est, boni et veri apud eum, fruitur 
beatitudine et felicitate in altera vita, nam ut dictum, reconditae sunt in interiore ejus homine, et tunc patent cum homo corporea et mundana reliquit; Dominus solus novit, quales et quantae hominis 
reliquiae sunt; homo nusquam hoc scire potest; nam hodie homo talis est ut mentiri possit bonum, cum tamen intus nihil nisi malum est; tum quoque homo apparere potest sicut malus, cum tamen intus 
habeat bonum; quare nusquam homini licet judicare de altero qualis {3} ejus vita spirituale est, solus enim Dominus, ut dictum, hoc novit; sed unicuique licet judicare de altero qualis est quoad vitam 
moralem et civilem, hoc enim societatis interest: [4] communissimum est quod illi qui opinionem captarunt, de aliquo vero fidei, de aliis judicent quod salvari nequeant nisi similiter credant ac illi, 
quod tamen Dominus prohibuit, Matth vii 1, 2; cum tamen ex multa experientia mihi notum factum sit quod ex omni religione salventur, modo per charitatis vitam reliquias boni (c)et apparentis veri receperint; 
haec sunt quae intellecta per `si inventi fuerint decem, quod non perderentur propter decem,' quibus significatum, si reliquiae essent, quod salvarentur.  [5] Charitatis vita es bene cogitare 
de alio et ei bene velle, et percipere apud se gaudium ex eo quod alii etiam salventur; at charitatis vitam non habent qui volunt quod nulli alii salventur quam qui credunt sicut ii, (m)et magi: qui 
indignantur quod aliter sit(n): hoc constare potest solum ex eo quod plures ex gentibus quam ex Christianis salventur; qui erunt eorum bene cogitarunt de proximo et ei bene voluerunt, melius quam qui 
Christiani vocantur, vera fidei in altera vita recipiunt, et prae Christianis agnoscunt Dominum; angelis enim nihil jucundius e felicius est quam instruere illos qui ex tellure in alteram vitam veniunt 	@1
