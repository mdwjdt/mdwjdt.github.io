Verses 12-15. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set on the earth, and its head reaching to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And behold Jehovah standing upon it; 
and He said, I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and 
thou shalt break forth to the sea, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee shall all the families of the ground be blessed, and in thy seed; and behold I am with thee, and will 
keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back to this ground; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee. "And he dreamed," signifies foresight; "and 
behold a ladder set on the earth," signifies the communication of the lowest truth and its derivative good; "and its head reaching to heaven," signifies with the Divine; "and behold the angels of God 
ascending and descending on it," signifies infinite and eternal communication, and the consequent conjunction; and that from what is lowest there is as it were an ascent, and afterwards when the order 
is inverted, a descent; "and behold Jehovah standing upon it," signifies the Lord in the highest; "and He said, I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father," signifies the Lord, that from Him that good 
comes; "and the God of Isaac," signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human; "the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it," signifies the good in which He was, that it was from what was His own; 
"and to thy seed," signifies that so also was the truth; "and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth," signifies that Divine truth natural would be as natural good; "and thou shalt break forth 
to the sea, and to the east," signifies the infinite extension of good; "and to the north, and to the south," signifies the infinite extension of truth; thus all states of good and truth; "and in thee 
shall all the families of the ground be blessed," signifies that all truths of the good of doctrine will be conjoined with good; "and in thy seed," signifies and with truth; "and behold I am with thee," 
signifies the Divine "and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest," signifies the Divine Providence; "and will bring thee back to this ground," signifies conjunction with Divine doctrine; "for I 
will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee," signifies that nothing would be wanting to prevent its having effect. </p>

Verses 12-15 And he dreamed, and behold, a stairway set up on the earth, and its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of Got going up and coming down on it. And behold, Jehovah was standing 
above it, and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I will give to you and to your seed. And your seed will be as the dust of the 
earth, and you will break forth towards the sea, and towards the east, and towards the north, and towards the south; and in you will all the families of the ground be blessed - and in your seed. And 
behold, I am with you, and will guard you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this ground; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken about to you. </p>
<p>'He dreamed' means foresight. 
'And behold, a stairway set up on the earth' means a communication of lowest truth and of good derived from this truth. 'And its top reaching to heaven' means with the Divine. 'And behold, the 
angels of God going up and coming down on it' means an infinite and eternal communication and the consequent joining together - a going up, so to speak, from what is lowest, and after that, when order 
has been inverted, a coming down to it. 'And behold, Jehovah was standing above it' means the Lord at the highest point. 'And He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father' means the Lord in 
whom that good originated. 'And the God of Isaac' means the Lord's Divine Human. 'The land on which you are lying I will give to you' means that the good on which the Natural rested was His own in origin. 
'And to your seed' means truth also. 'And your seed will be as the dust of the earth' means that Divine natural Truth would be as natural good. 'And you will break forth towards the sea, and towards 
the east' means infinite extension of good, while 'and towards the north, and towards the south' means infinite extension of truth - thus every state of good and truth. 'And in you will all the 
families of the ground be blessed' means that all truths taught by doctrine which look to good will be joined to good. 'And in your seed' means and to truth. 'And behold, I am with you' means the Divine. 
'And will guard you wherever you go' means Divine Providence. 'And will bring you back to this ground' means conjunction with doctrine that is Divine. 'For I will not leave you until I have done what 
I have spoken about to you' means that nothing would be missing to prevent its actually happening. </p>

Vers. 12-15.  Et somniavit; et ecce scala statuta terrae, et caput ejus pertingens caelum, et ecce angeli Dei ascendentes et descendentes in illa. Et ecce Jehovah stans super illa, et dixit, Ego Jehovah 
Deus Abrahami patris tui, et Deus Jishaki; terram qua tu cubans super ea, tibi dabo eam, et semini tuo. Et erit semen tuum, sicut pulvis terrae, et erumpes ad mare, et ad orientem, et ad septentrionem, 
et ad meridiem; et benedicentur in te omnes familiae humi, et in semine tuo. Et ecce Ego cum te, et custodiam te in omni quo eas, et reducam te ad humum hanc, quia non relinquam te, donec quod 
fecero quod locutus tibi. `Somniavit' significat praevidentiam: `et ecce scala statuta terrae' significat communicationem infimi veri et boni inde: `et caput ejus pertingens caelum' significat cum Divino: 
`et ecce angeli Dei ascendentes et descendentes in illa' significat infinitam et aeternam communicationem et inde conjunctionem; et quod ex infimo quasi ascensus, et dein, cum ordo inversus, descensus: 
`et ecce Jehovah stans super illa' significat Dominum in supremo: `et dixit, Ego Jehovah Deus Abrahami patris tui' significat Dominum quod ex Ipso bonum illud: `et Deus Jishaki' significat Dominum 
quoad Divinum Humanum: `terram, qua tu cubans super ea, tibi dabo eam' significat bonum in quo esset, quod ex proprio: `et semini tuo' significat quod quoque verum: `et erit semen tuum sicut pulvis 
terrae' significat quod Divinum Verum naturale esset sicut bonum naturale: `et erumpes ad mare et ad orientem' significat extensionem infinitam boni: `et ad septentrionem et ad meridiem' significat 
extensionem infinitam veri; ita omnes status boni et veri: `et benedicentur in te omnes familiae humi' significat quod omnia vera boni doctrinae conjungentur bono: `et semini tuo' significat et vero: 
`et ecce Ego cum te' significat quod Divinum: `et custodiam te in omni quo eas' significat Divinam Providentiam: `et reducam te ad humum hanc' significat conjunctionem cum Divina doctrina: `quia non relinquam 
te, donec quod fecero quod locutus tibi' significat quod nihil deerit quin effectum habitura. </p>
