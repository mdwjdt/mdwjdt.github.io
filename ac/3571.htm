<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3571.</strong>创世记27:26-29. 他父亲以撒对他说，我儿，你近前来吻我。他就近前亲吻父亲。他父亲一闻他的衣服上的香气，就给他祝福说，看，我儿的香气如同耶和华赐福之田地的香气一样。愿神赐你天上的甘露、地上的肥土，并许多五谷新酒。愿多民事奉你，多民跪拜你；愿你作你弟兄的主，你母亲的儿子向你跪拜。凡咒诅你的，愿他受咒诅；为你祝福的，愿他蒙福。<br />“他父亲以撒对他说，你近前来”表还要更为内在的直觉程度。“我儿，吻我”表能否联结。“他就近前亲吻父亲”表在场和联结。“他父亲一闻他的衣服上的香气”表他所感知到的良善真理散发的令人愉悦之物。“就给他祝福”表由此的结合。“说，看，我儿的香气”表从良善的真理所感知到的愉悦。“如同田地的香气”表如同来自真理所出的良善之地。“耶和华赐福”表它通过神性繁殖、增多。“愿神赐你天上的甘露”表通过神圣真理。“地上的肥土”表通过神圣良善。“许多五谷”表由此衍生的属世良善。“新酒”表由此衍生的属世真理。“愿多民事奉你”表教会的真理，或属灵教会。“多民跪拜你”表基于良善的真理。“愿你作你弟兄的主”表一开始，对属世真理的情感看似统治对属世良善的情感。“你母亲的儿子向你跪拜”表（统治）所有其它对真理的情感。“凡咒诅你的，愿他受咒诅”表凡使自己分离的，必被分离。“为你祝福的，愿他蒙福”表凡使自己结合的，必被结合。</p>

Verses 26-29. And Isaac his father said unto him, Come near I pray, and kiss me, my son. And he came near, and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, See, the 
smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed. And God shall give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fat things of the earth, and a multitude of corn and new wine. Peoples 
shall serve thee, and peoples shall bow down themselves to thee. Be thou a master to thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down themselves to thee; cursed are they that curse thee, and blessed 
are they that bless thee. "And Isaac his father said unto him, Come near I pray," signifies a degree of perception still more interior; "and kiss me, my son" signifies whether it can be united; "and he 
came near, and kissed him," signifies presence and unition; "and he smelled the smell of his garments," signifies that which was grateful from the truth of good which he perceived; "and blessed him," 
signifies conjunction thus; "and said, See, the smell of my son," signifies that which was grateful from the truth of good; "is as the smell of a field," signifies as from good ground out of which is 
truth; "which Jehovah hath blessed," signifies that it is multiplied and made fruitful from the Divine; "and God shall give thee of the dew of heaven," signifies from Divine truth; "and of the fat things 
of the earth," signifies from Divine good; "and a multitude of corn," signifies the derivative natural good; "and new wine," signifies the derivative natural truth; "peoples shall serve thee," signifies 
the truths of the church, or spiritual churches; "and peoples shall bow down themselves to thee," signifies the truths of good; "Be thou a master to thy brethren," signifies the dominion at first 
appearing to be that of the affection of natural truth over the affections of natural good; "and let thy mother's sons bow down themselves to thee," signifies over all other affections of truth; 
"cursed are they that curse thee," signifies that he who disjoins himself shall be disjoined; "and blessed are they that bless thee," signifies that he who conjoins himself shall be conjoined. </p>

Verses 26-29 And Isaac his father said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. And he came near and kissed him. And he smelled the odour of his clothes, and he blessed him, and he said, See, the 
odour of my son, like the odour of the field that Jehovah has blessed. And God will give to you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the land, and abundance of grain and of new wine. Peoples will 
serve you, and peoples will bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and your mother's sons will bow down to you. Cursed are those cursing you, and blessed those blessing you. </p>
<p>'Isaac his father 
said to him, Come near now' means a degree of perception more interior still. 'And kiss me, my son' means as to whether union is possible. 'And he came near and kissed him' means presence and union. 
'And he smelled the odour of his clothes' means the pleasing emanation from the truth of good which he perceived. 'And he blessed him' means conjunction thereby. 'And he said, See, the odour of my 
son' means pleasure perceived in truth acquired from good. 'Like the odour of the field' means as the good ground from which truth is acquired. 'That Jehovah has blessed' means which is multiplied and 
made fruitful from the Divine. 'And God will give to you of the dew of heaven' means from Divine Truth. 'And of the fatness of the land' means from Divine Good. 'And abundance of grain' means natural 
good from this. 'And of new wine' means natural truth from the same. 'Peoples will serve you' means truths of the Church.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 'And peoples will bow down to you' means truths grounded in good. 'Be lord over 
your brothers' means the apparent dominion at first of the affection for natural truth over affections for natural good. 'And your mother's sons will bow down to you' means over all other affections

Vers. 26-29.  Et dixit ad illum Jishak pater illius, Accede quaeso, et osculare me, fili mi.  Et accessit, et osculatus est illum, et odoratus est odorem vestium illius, et benedixit illi, et dixit, 
Vide, odor filii me sicut odor agri, cui benedixit Jehovah. Et dabit tibi Deus de rore caeli: et de pinguedinibus terrae, et multitudinem frumenti et musti. Servient tibi populi, et incurvabunt se tibi 
populi, esto herus fratribus tuis, et incurvabunt se tibi filii matris tuae; maledicentes tibi maledictus, et benedicentes tibi benedictus. `Dixit ad illum Jishak pater illius, Accede quaeso' significat 
perceptionis adhuc interioris gradum: `et osculare me, fili mi' significat num uniri possit: `et accessit, et osculatus est illum' significat praesentiam et unitionem: `et odoratus est odorem vestium 
illius' significat gratum ex boni vero quod percepit: `et benedixit illi' significat conjunctionem ita: `et dixit, Vide, odor filii mei' significat gratum ex boni vero: `sicut odor agri' significat 
ut ex bona humo ex qua verum: `cui benedixit Jehovah' significat quod multiplicatur et fructificatur ex Divino: `et dabit tibi Deus de rore caeli' significat ex Divino Vero: `et de pinguedinibus terrae' 
significat ex Divino Bono:  `et multitudinem frumenti' significat inde bonum naturale: `et musti' significat inde verum naturale: `servient tibi populi' significat vera Ecclesiae, {1}seu Ecclesias 
spirituales: `et incurvabunt se tibi populi' significat vera boni: `esto herus fratribus tuis' significat dominium primum apparens affectionis veri naturalis super affectiones boni naturalis: `et 
incurvabunt se tibi filii matris tuae' significat super affectiones reliquas veri:  `maledicentes tibi maledictus' significat quod qui se disjungit, disjunctus erit: `et benedicentes tibi benedictus' 
significat qui se conjungit, conjunctus erit. @1 A had these words but deletes them, both A and I omit in n. 3581.$  </p>
