<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7014节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7014.</strong>“于是摩西就去，回到”表恢复以前的生活。这从“去”和“回到”或“回去”的含义，以及“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“去”是指生活（参看<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5493.htm">5493</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>节）；“回到”或“回去”是指在他以前生活过的地方生活；“摩西”是指从神来的律法或真理方面的主（<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>节）。当摩西在何烈山上与在火焰中显现的耶和华在一起时，他代表神性真理方面的主；但现在与他的岳父叶忒罗在一起，而叶忒罗是处于简单良善之真理的教会之良善，于是他代表从神来的真理方面的主。在圣言中，此处和别处在内义上描述的都是主在世时所经历的全部生命状态，祂如何使祂的人身变成神性。这些状态一个接一个出现，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：当主是个小孩子时，祂就像一个小孩子，之后在聪明逐渐成长，并且不断将神性之爱灌输到这些聪明智慧中，直到最后祂的人身也变成神性之爱，也就是神性存在或耶和华。主因以这种方式相继，也就是在一个又一个的状态中披上神性，故首先将祂自己变成从神来的真理，之后变成神性真理，最后变成神性良善。这些就是此处和别处在圣言的内义上所描述的主荣耀的各个阶段。</p>

And Moses went, and returned. That this signifies continuation of the former life, is evident from the signification of "going," as being life (see n. 4882, 5493, 5605); from the signification of "returning," 
or "going back," as being to live where he lived before; and from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to the law or truth from the Divine (n. 6771, 6827). When Moses was in Mount 
Horeb with Jehovah seen in a flame, he then represented the Lord as to Divine truth; but now with Jethro his father-in-law, who is the good of the church which is in the truth of simple good, he represents 
the Lord as to truth from the Divine. Here and elsewhere in the Word, in the internal sense, are described all the states of the Lord's life in the world, how He then made His Human Divine. That 
the states were successive, can be seen from the fact that the Lord when an infant was like an infant, and that He afterward grew in intelligence and wisdom, and continually instilled into these the 
Divine love, even until He became the Divine love, that is, the Divine being or Jehovah, as to His Human also. And as the Lord in this way successively put on the Divine, He therefore first made Himself 
truth from the Divine, afterward Divine truth, and at last the Divine good. These were the steps of the glorification of the Lord which are described here and elsewhere in the internal sense of 
the Word. </p>

'And Moses went and returned' means a resumption of the former life. This is clear from the meaning of 'going' as life, dealt with in <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5493.htm">5493</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>; from the meaning of 'returning', or going back, 
as living where he had done so formerly; and from the representation of 'Moses' as the Lord in respect of the law or truth from God, dealt with in <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>. When Moses was on Mount Horeb with Jehovah, 
who appeared in a flame of fire, he represented the Lord in respect of Divine Truth; but now that he is with Jethro his father-in-law, who is the good of the Church which is guided by the truth that 
goes with simple good, he represents the Lord in respect of truth from God. Here and elsewhere in the Word the internal sense describes how, during all the states of life which the Lord passed through 
in the world, He was making His Human Divine. These states followed one after another, as may be recognized from the fact that when He was a young child the Lord was like a young child, and after 
that grew in intelligence and wisdom, all the time instilling Divine Love into them till at length His Human too became Divine Love, which is Divine Being (Esse) or Jehovah. And this being the way in 
which the Lord put on the Divine - that is, in one state after another - He therefore first made Himself truth from God, after this Divine Truth, and finally Divine Good. These were the stages in the 
glorification of the Lord that are described here and elsewhere in the internal sense of the Word. </p>

`Et ivit Moscheh et reversus': quod significet vitae prioris continuum, constat (c)ex significatione `ire' quod sit vita, de qua n. 4882, 5493, (x)5605; ex significatione `reverti' seu `redire' quod 
sit vivere ubi prius, et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Dominus quoad legem seu verum a Divino, de qua n. 6771, 6827; cum Moscheh fuit in Chorebo monte apud Jehovam in flamma visum, tunc repraesentabat 
Dominum quoad Divinum Verum; nunc autem apud Jethronem socerum suum, qui est bonum Ecclesiae quae in vero simplicis boni, repraesentat Dominum quoad verum a Divino.  Hic et alibi in Verbo in 
sensu {1} interno describuntur omnes status vitae Domini in mundo, quomodo tunc Humanum Suum Divinum fecit; quod status successivi fuerint, constare potest ex eo quod Dominus cum infans sicut infans 
fuerit, et quod postea succreverit in intelligentia et sapientia, ac jugiter illis insinuaverit (t)Divinum Amorem, usque dum etiam quoad Humanum Suum factus sit Divinus Amor, hoc est, Divinum Esse seu 
Jehovah; (d)et quia Dominus ita successive induit Divinum, inde est quod primum Se fecerit verum a Divino, postmodum Divinum Verum, (c)et tandem Divinum Bonum; hi gradus glorificationis Domini fuerunt, 
qui hic et alibi in sensu interno Verbi describuntur. 	@1 cp n. 7013$ </p>
