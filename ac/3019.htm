<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3019节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3019.</strong>“亚伯拉罕对他的仆人，他家中的老者说”表主在其属世人里面的排序和流入，其属世人由“仆人，家中的老者”来表示。这从此处“说”的含义清楚可知，“说”是指吩咐，因为亚伯拉罕的话是对仆人说的。由于此处论述的主题是凭属世人里面所存在之物的神性重新排列，故“说”表示排序和流入。因为在属世人或外在人里面所做的一切事就是理性人或内在人的一种排序，并凭借流注实现。“仆人，家中的老者”表示属世层或属世人，这从“仆人”的含义清楚可知。“仆人”较为低级，是服侍较为高级之物的，或也可说，是外在并服侍内在的（参看<a href="2541.htm">2541</a>，<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>节）。属于属世人的一切事物，如各种记忆知识，无非是服侍之物，因为它们服侍理性，能使其在它所思想的事上完全公平，在它所意愿的事上完全公义。“家中的老者”是指属世人，这从下文可以看出来。</p>

Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house. That this signifies the arrangement in order and influx of the Lord in His natural, which is the "servant the elder of the house," is evident from 
the signification here of "saying" as being to command, because it is said to a servant; and as the subject here treated of is the disposition by the Divine of the things that are in the natural man; 
"to say" denotes to arrange in order and to flow in; for all that is done in the natural or external man is arranged in order by the rational or internal man, and is effected by influx. That the "servant 
the elder of the house" is the natural, or the natural man, is evident from the signification of "servant," as being that which is lower and which serves what is higher; or what is the same, that 
which is outer and serves what is inner (see n. 2541, 2567). All things that are of the natural man, such as memory-knowledges of whatever kind, are nothing but things of service; for they serve the 
rational by enabling it to think equitably and will justly. That the "elder of the house" is the natural man, may be seen from what follows. </p>

'Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house' means the ordering and influx of the Lord into His Natural, meant by 'the servant, the oldest of the house'. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' 
here as commanding since it is a servant to whom Abraham's words are addressed; and since the subject is the re-arranging by the Divine of the things that exist in the natural man, ordering and 
influx are meant. For everything that is done in the natural or external man is an ordering by the rational or internal, and is effected by means of influx. The use of the expression 'the servant, the 
oldest of the house' to mean the natural, or the natural man, may be seen from the meaning of 'a servant' as that which is lower and serves what is higher, or what amounts to the same, that which is 
exterior and serves what is interior, see <a href="2541.htm">2541</a>, <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>. All things that belong to the natural man, as facts of every kind do, are nothing else than a body of servants, for they serve the rational by enabling 
it to be thoroughly fair in what it thinks and righteous in what it wills. That 'the oldest of the house' is the natural man becomes clear from what follows below. </p>

`Dixit Abraham ad servum suum seniorem domus suae': quod significet ordinationem et influxum Domini in Ipsius Naturale, quod est `servus senior domus,' constat a significatione `dicere' hic quod sit 
mandare, quia ad servum; et quia {1}agitur de dispositione illorum quae in naturali homine a Divino, est ordinare et influere; omne enim quod agitur in naturali seu externo homine, ordinatur a rationali 
seu interno, et fit per influxum: quod `servus senior domus' sit naturale seu naturalis homo, constare potest a significatione `servi' quod sit illud quod inferius est, et servit superiori, seu quod 
idem, quod exterius est et servit interiori, videatur n. 2541, 2567; omnia quae sunt naturalis hominis, ut scientifica cujuscumque generis, non aliud sunt quam servitia; inserviunt enim rationali ut 
aeque cogitare et juste velle possit; quod `senior domus' sit naturalis {2}homo, constare potest ab illis quae sequuntur. @1 fit$  @2 i seu externus$  </p>
