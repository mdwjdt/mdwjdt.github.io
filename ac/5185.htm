<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5185节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5185.</strong>有些灵人与胰管、肝管和胆囊管有关，因而也与它们里面肠所排出的胆汁有关。这些灵人具有不同种类，并且是分开的；然而，他们都照着他们的运作所指向之人的状态一起行动。他们主要出现在他们所渴望负责的惩戒和处罚的时候。他们当中最坏的人如此顽固，以致他们若不是被恐惧和威胁吓跑，根本就不想停下来；因为他们害怕自己受到惩罚，所以会答应做任何事。他们就是那些活在肉身时固守己见的灵人，与其说是因为他们过着邪恶的生活，倒不如说是因为他们天生邪恶、执拗。当处于自己的属世状态时，他们根本就没有真正的想法（当一个人同时对许多事物有模糊的想法，却对任何一个具体事物没有清晰的想法时，他根本就没有真正的想法）。他们的快乐在于惩罚和以这种方式行善；但他们却不克制污秽的行为。</p>

There are spirits who relate to the Pancreatic, Hepatic, and Cystic Ducts, and consequently to the biles in them, which the intestines cast out. These spirits are of different kinds, but act in consort 
according to the state of those to whom the working is directed. They present themselves chiefly at chastisements and punishments, which they desire to direct. The worst of them are so stubborn that 
they are not willing to desist unless deterred by fears and threats; for they dread sufferings, and then promise anything. They are those who in the life of the body have clung tenaciously to their 
opinions, not so much from evil of life as from a natural depravity. When they are in their natural state they think nothing; to think nothing is to think obscurely of many things together, and not distinctly 
of anything. Their delight is to chastise, and in this way to do good; nor do they abstain from things unclean. </p>

There are spirits who correlate with the Pancreatic Duct, the Hepatic Duct, and the Cystic Duct, and who consequently correlate with the bile present in them, which is excreted by the intestines. These 
groups of spirits are distinct and separate, yet they work together as demanded by the state of those in whom they operate. They are present in particular at chastisements and punishments, which they 
would like to be in charge of. The worst of them are so stubborn that they have no wish at all to desist unless they are frightened off by fears and threats; for they are afraid of being punished themselves, 
and so will promise to do anything. They are spirits who during their lifetime stuck rigidly to their own opinions, not so much because they led an evil life as because they were naturally 
perverse. When in their own natural state they have no real thought at all (a person has no real thought at all when he has vague thoughts about many things simultaneously but has no distinct idea about 
any one thing in particular). Their delights consist in the work of chastisement and doing good by carrying it out; but they do not refrain from foul deeds. </p>

</p><b>5185.</b>
Sunt spiritus qui referunt ductum pancreaticum, hepaticum, et cysticum, consequenter biles quae in illis, quas intestina ejiciunt; sunt spiritus illi distincti inter se, sed in consortio agunt secundum 
statum corum ad quos determinatur operatio; illi imprimis adsistunt castigationibus et punitionibus, quas volunt dirigere; qui eorum pessimi sunt, tam contumaces sunt, ut nusquam velint desistere 
nisi per timores et minas deterreantur, timent enim supplicia, et tunc promittunt omnia. Sunt illi qui in vita corporis tenaciter inhaeserant suis opinionibus, non ita ex malo vitae, quam ex 
pravitate naturali; eunt in statu suo naturali sunt, tunc nihil cogitant, nihil cogitare est obscure de pluribus simul, et nihil distincte de aliquo; delectationes eorum sunt castigare, et sic bonum 
facere; nec abstinent a sordidis. </p>
