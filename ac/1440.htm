<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1440节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1440.</strong>“亚伯兰经过那地，直到示剑地方”表主的第二个状态，这时，祂意识到爱的属天事物，也就是示剑所表示的。这从之前发生的一切，以及所有这些事的先后顺序清楚可知：从之前发生的一切可知，即祂逐渐接受并获得爱的属天事物，也就是“他们都出来往迦南地”和“他们就到了迦南地”所表示的；从事件的先后顺序可知，即后来祂接受并获得属天事物，就在这时，祂意识到这些事物。属天事物里面有灵魂的真光；因为神性本身，即耶和华自己在它们里面。当主获得属天事物后，祂便将人性本质与神性本质结合起来，故耶和华必然向祂显现。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1440.</strong> The symbolism of Abram passed through the land all the way to the place of Shechem as the Lord's second state, when the heavenly qualities of love would appear to him, can be seen from remarks above and from the overall scheme. The remarks above include the fact that he would press on all the way to the heavenly aspects of love and that he arrived at them, symbolized by "they left to go into the land of Canaan" and "they came into the land of Canaan." The overall scheme indicates that after he continued on to heavenly qualities and reached them, they became visible to him. Heavenly traits contain the soul's true light, because they contain divinity itself, that is, Jehovah himself. And since the Lord was going to unite his human essence to his divine essence when he arrived at heavenly qualities, it was inevitable that Jehovah would appear to him. </p>

Abram passed through the land, even unto the place Shechem. That this signifies the Lord's second state, when the celestial things of love became apparent to Him, is evident from what precedes and from 
the order of all these events-from what precedes, in that He advanced to the celestial things of love and attained to them, which is signified by "they went forth to go into the land of Canaan," and 
by "they came into the land of Canaan;" and from the order of the events, in that after He had advanced to celestial things and had attained to them, they then became apparent to Him. In celestial things 
there is the very light of the soul; because the Divine itself, that is, Jehovah Himself, is in them; and as the Lord was to conjoin the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, when He attained to 
celestial things it could not be otherwise than that Jehovah appeared to Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1440</b></p><p><b>1440.</b>
'Abram went through the land as far as the place of Shechem' means the Lord's second state, when the celestial things of love became apparent to Him. This becomes clear from what has gone before and 
from the whole sequence of events in what has gone before, that He drew closer to and attained to the celestial things of love, meant by 'they came out to go into the land of Canaan' and by 'they came 
into the land of Canaan'; from the whole sequence of events, that after He had drawn closer to and attained to celestial things, these at that point became apparent to Him. Celestial things have the 
very light of the soul within them, because they have the Divine itself, that is, Jehovah Himself, within them. And because the Lord was to join the Human Essence to the Divine Essence when He attained 
to celestial things, it was inevitable that Jehovah should appear to Him. </p>

</p><b>1440.</b>
'Transivit Abram per terram usque ad locum Shechem':  quod significet alterum statum Domini cum caelestia amoris Ipsi apparerent, constare potest ab illis quae praecedunt et ex ordine omnium; ex illis 
quae praecedunt quod pergeret ad caelestia amoris et quod pervenerit ad illa, quae significata sunt per 'quod exiverint ad eundum in terram Canaan, et quod venerint in terram Canaan':  ex ordine omnium, 
quod postquam perrexerit ad caelestia et pervenerit ad illa, tunc apparuerint Ipsi; in caelestibus est ipsa lux animae, quia in illis est ipsum Divinum, hoc est, Ipse Jehovah; et quia Dominus conjungeret 
Humanam Essentiam Divinae cum ad caelestia pervenit, non potuit aliter quam quod Jehovah Ipsi appareret. </p>
