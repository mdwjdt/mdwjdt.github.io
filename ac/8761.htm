<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8761节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8761.</strong>“耶和华从山上呼唤他说”表天堂里的神性良善与那里的神性真理的合一。这从“呼唤他”和“山”的含义清楚可知。“呼吸他”或“呼唤某人到祂自己这里”当论及神性，是指结合，在此是指合一，因为它论及通过结合合而为一的的神性良善与神性真理；事实上，“呼唤某人到祂自己这里”是指结合，以及同在（参看<a href="6047.htm">6047</a>，<a href="6177.htm">6177</a>，<a href="7390.htm">7390</a>，<a href="7451.htm">7451</a>，<a href="7721.htm">7721</a>节）。它之所以是与神性良善的结合，是因为此处经上用的是“耶和华”这个名（关于这个主题，可参看刚才的<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>节）。“山”是指天堂里的神性良善，如刚才所述（<a href="8758.htm">8758</a>节），在此是指天堂；无论你说“天堂里的神性良善”，还是说“天堂”，意思都一样，因为天堂是从该良善产生的。此处的情形就像从人那里抽象出来的一切属灵品质。当论及这些品质时，具有它们的人就会浮现在脑海中；如同当论及信之真理或仁之良善时，它们所住在其中的教会成员就会浮现在脑海中一样。在天堂尤其如此，因为在那里，与神性真理合一的神性良善是全部中的全部，因而是天堂的生命或灵魂。</p>

And Jehovah called unto him from the mountain. That this signifies the union of the Divine good in heaven with the Divine truth there, is evident from the signification of "calling unto him," or "calling 
anyone unto Himself," when said of the Divine, as being conjunction, here union, because it is said of Divine good with Divine truth which are made one by conjunction. (That "to call anyone to Himself" 
denotes conjunction, and also presence, see n. 6047, 6177, 7390, 7451, 7721.) That it is Divine good with which there was conjunction, is because the name here used is "Jehovah" (on which subject 
see just above, n. 8760). And from the signification of "mountain," as being good Divine in heaven (on which just above, n. 8758), here heaven; for whether you say "Divine good in heaven," or "heaven," 
it is the same, because heaven arises from this good. The case herein is like that of all other things abstracted from their subjects, which when spoken of nevertheless lead to the perception of 
the subjects in which they are; as when the truth of faith, or the good of charity, is spoken of, there is understood the man of the church in whom they are. This is especially the case in heaven, for 
there the Divine good united to the Divine truth is all in all, thus is the life or soul of heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8761</b></p><p><b>8761.</b>
'And Jehovah called to him from the mountain' means the union of Divine Good in heaven with Divine Truth there. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling to him', or calling someone to oneself, when 
said of the Divine, as a joining together, at this point a union, since it is said in reference to Divine Good and Divine Truth, which by being joined together are made one (for the meaning of 'calling 
someone to oneself' as a joining together, and also presence, see <a href="6047.htm">6047</a>, <a href="6177.htm">6177</a>, <a href="7390.htm">7390</a>, <a href="7451.htm">7451</a>, <a href="7721.htm">7721</a>; and the reason why it is a joining to Divine Good is that the name Jehovah' is used, regarding which 
see immediately above in <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>); and from the meaning of 'the mountain' as Divine good in heaven, dealt with just above in <a href="8758.htm">8758</a>. At this point heaven itself is meant, for whether you say Divine Good in 
heaven or simply say heaven it amounts to the same thing since heaven springs into being from that Good. The situation here is the same as with all spiritual qualities considered in isolation from persons 
in whom they reside. When those qualities are spoken of, persons in whom they reside nevertheless spring to mind, as when the truth of faith or the good of charity is spoken of, the member of the 
Church in whom it resides springs to mind. This is especially so in regard to heaven, for there Divine Good united to Divine Truth is the All in all, that is, the life or soul of heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8761</b>
</p><b>8761.</b>
`Et vocavit ad illum Jehovah e monte': quod significet unionem Divini Boni in caelo cum Divino Vero ibi, constat ex significatione `vocare ad illum' seu vocare ad se aliquem, cum dicitur de Divino, 
quod sit conjunctio, hic unio, {1}quia dicitur de Divino Bono cum Divino Vero, quae per conjunctionem unum fiunt; quod `vocare aliquem ad se' sit conjunctio et quoque praesentia, videatur n. 6047, 6177, 
7390, 7451, 7721; quod sit Divinum Bonum cum quo conjunctio, est quia dicitur `Jehovah,' de qua re nunc supra n. 8760, et ex significatione `montis' quod sit bonum Divinum in caelo, de qua mox supra 
n. 8758, hic caelum, nam sive dicas Divinum Bonum in caelo sive caelum, idem est, quia caelum existit ex illo; se habet hoc sicut abstracta quaecumque a suis subjectis, quae cum dicuntur, usque percipiuntur 
subjecta in quibus sunt; sicut cum dicitur verum fidei aut bonum charitatis, intelligitur homo Ecclesiae in quo; magis in caelo, nam ibi Divinum Bonum unitum Divino Vero est omne in omnibus, 
ita vita seu anima caeli. 	@1 nam$ </p>
