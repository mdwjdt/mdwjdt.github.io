<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>440.</strong>“那时候，人才求告耶和华的名”表该教会出于仁的敬拜，这一点从以下事实明显可知，即“求告耶和华的名”是敬拜主时的普遍习惯用语；这种敬拜出于仁，这一点从两个事实明显可知，一是此处提及的是“耶和华”，而在前节祂被称为神；二是若非出于仁，不可能敬拜主，因为真正的敬拜不可能出自与仁无关的信，那样的敬拜只是口头上的，而非发自内心。“求告耶和华的名”是敬拜主时的习惯用语，可从圣言看出来；因此论及亚伯拉罕，“他在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.8.htm">12:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.4.htm">13:4</a>）；再如，“他在别是巴载上一棵垂丝柳树，就在那里求告耶和华永生神的名”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.33.htm">21:33</a>）。一切敬拜都有这种说法，这一点从以赛亚书显而易见：<br />耶和华以色列的圣者如此说：“雅各啊，你并没有求告我；以色列啊，你倒厌烦我。你没有将你的羊带来给我作燔祭，也没有用祭物尊敬我。我没有因供物使你服劳，也没有因乳香使你厌烦”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.14.htm">43:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.22.htm">22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这些话概述了一切有代表性的敬拜。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]440.</strong> The symbolism of then people began to call on the name of Jehovah as worship from charity in that church can be seen from the fact that invoking Jehovah's name is a ritual common to all worship of the Lord. The fact that the worship is based on charity is established by the use here of the name Jehovah (the last verse spoke of God) and by the fact that the Lord cannot be worshiped except from charity. Faith that does not come from charity does not lead to worship, because it lives only on the lips, not in the heart.<br />The Word makes it clear that calling on Jehovah's name is a common practice in all worship of the Lord. Take these words about Abram:<br />He built an altar to Jehovah and called on the name of Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_440/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_8" target=_top>Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_440/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_4" target=_top>13:4</a>)<br />He planted a grove in Beer-sheba and there called on the name of Jehovah, the God of eternity. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_440/bible_king-james-version_genesis_21_33" target=_top>Genesis 21:33</a>)<br />That it is an element of all worship is indicated in Isaiah:<br />Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, has said, "You have not called on me, Jacob, that you should have wearied of me, Israel. You have not brought me the animal of your burnt offerings, and with sacrifices you have not honored me. I have not made you serve me with your minha{*1} nor wearied you with frankincense." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_440/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_22-23" target=_top>Isaiah 43:22-23</a>)<br />This provides a summary of all representative worship.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Minha is a Hebrew word (מִנְחָה [minḥā]) whose general meaning is "an offering" and whose specific meaning is "a grain offering."

That by the words just quoted is signified the worship of that church from charity, is evident from the fact that to "call upon the name of Jehovah" is a customary and general form of speech for all 
worship of the Lord; and that this worship was from charity is evident from the fact that "Jehovah" is here mentioned, whereas in the preceding verse He was called "God" as well as from the fact that 
the Lord cannot be worshiped except from charity, since true worship cannot proceed from faith that is not of charity, because it is merely of the lips, and not of the heart. That to "call on the name 
of Jehovah" is a customary form of speech for all worship of the Lord, appears from the Word; thus it is said of Abraham, that "he built an altar to Jehovah, and called on the name of Jehovah" (Gen. 
12:8; 13:4); and again, that he "planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the God of eternity" (Gen. 21:33). That this expression includes all worship, is plain from Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah the Holy One of Israel hath said, Thou hast not called upon Me, O Jacob, but thou hast been weary of Me, O Israel. Thou hast not brought to Me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings, 
neither hast thou honored Me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense (Isa. 43:22-23), in which passage a summary is given of all representative worship. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 440</b></p><p><b>440.</b>
'Then they began to call on the name of Jehovah' means that Church's worship deriving from charity. This becomes clear from the fact that 'calling on the name of Jehovah' is a normal and common expression 
for all worship of the Lord. Its being worship deriving from charity is clear from the fact that the name, Jehovah' is used here, 'God' in the previous verse. It is also clear from the fact that 
it is impossible to worship the Lord except from charity. Worship stemming from faith that has no connection with charity is not possible, because it is worship solely of the lips and not of the heart. 
The fact that 'calling on the name of Jehovah' is a common expression for all worship of the Lord is clear from the Word, as where it is said of Abram that  </p>
<blockquote>
He built an altar to Jehovah and called 
on the name of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2012:8;%2013:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 12:8; 13:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also,  </p>
<blockquote>
He planted a grove in Beersheba and there he called on the name of Jehovah, the God of eternity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2021:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 21:33</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>That all worship is meant is clear 
in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, said, You did not call or Me, O Jacob, but you have been weary of Me, O Israel! You have not brought Me the small cattle of your burnt offerings, nor 
honoured Me with your sacrifices. I have not made you serve Me with the minchah, nor wearied you with frankincense. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:14,%2022,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:14, 22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These verses present in summary form the whole of representative worship.  </p>

Quod 'tunc coeptum invocare nomen Jehovae' significet Ecclesiae istius cultum ex charitate, constare potest ex eo quod 'invocare nomen Jehovae' sit sollemnis et communis formula omnis cultus Domini 
et quod ex charitate, constat inde quod dicatur hic 'Jehovah,' in praecedente versu 'Deus'; et quod non coli possit Dominus nisi quam ex charitate; ex fide quae non est charitatis, non datur cultus, quia 
solum est oris non cordis. Quod 'invocare nomen Jehovae' sit communis formula omnis cultus Domini, constat ex Verbo; ut de Abramo, 	Aedificavit altare Jehovae, et invocavit nomen Jehovae, Gen. xii 
8; xiii 4; </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>tum, 	Plantavit lucum in Beersheba, et invocavit ibi nomen 	Jehovae Dei aeternitatis, Gen. xxi 33:
	</p>
	<p>quod omnis cultus, apud Esaiam, 	Jehovah, Sanctus Israelis dixit, Non Me invocasti, 
Jacob, et fatigatus sis in Me, Israel; non adduxisti Mihi pecudem holocaustorum tuorum; et sacrificiis tuis non honorasti Me; non servire te feci per mincham; nec defatigavi te per tus, xliii 	22, 23;
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ubi 
in summario omnis cultus repraesentativus exponitur. </p>
