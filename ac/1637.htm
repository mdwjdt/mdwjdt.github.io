<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1637.</strong>来世的奇事之一是：灵人与世人说话时用的是这个世人的母语，而且说得自然流畅，仿佛他们也在那地出生，并用同样的语言被抚养长大；无论他们来自欧洲、亚洲，还是世界其它地方。那些生活在数千年前、语言尚未形成之时的人也一样。事实上，当与世人交谈时，灵人只知道他们用的是自己的语言，也就是自己国家的语言。人所精通的其它语言也一样；不过，除了这些语言外，灵人无法发出别的语言的一个音节，除非主直接使他们这样做。即使死前尚未学会说话的小孩子也能以这样的方式说话。<br />其原因在于，灵人所熟悉的语言并非由话语构成，而是由思想观念构成。这种语言是一切语言所通用的；当灵人与某个世人在一起时，其思想观念会落入这个人里面的话语中。这一切以一种对应和适合的方式进行，以致灵人只知道这些话是他们自己的，他们在用自己的语言说话，殊不知，他们用的是这个人的语言。我有时也与灵人谈论这些事。所有灵魂一进入来世，都被赐予能理解全世界所有人言语的天赋，仿佛是他们的母语，因为他们能感知一个人的所思所想。除此之外，他们还被赋予其它更完美的能力。正因如此，灵魂在肉体死亡后，能与所有人交谈并来往，不管他们在哪个地区，使用哪种语言。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1637.</strong> One of the amazing things that happen in the other life is that when spirits talk to us humans, they do so in our native language. They speak it as easily and fluently as if they had been born in the same land and raised with the same language, whether they come from Europe or the Near East or some other part of the globe. So do those who lived thousands of years earlier, before the language even existed. In fact spirits have no idea that the speech they use with us is not their own native tongue. They use our secondary languages too, but beyond these, they are not capable of producing one syllable of another language, unless the Lord gives it directly to them. Even babies who die before they have really learned any language at all talk this way.<br />[2] The reason, though, is that the language that spirits are familiar with is composed not of words but of thoughts.{*1} This language is common to all tongues. When spirits are present with a person on earth, their individual thoughts fall into words the person knows. The thoughts agree with and adapt to those words so perfectly that the spirits have no notion that the actual words are not their own. They fully believe they are speaking their own language, when it is really the person's language they are speaking. I have discussed these matters with spirits a number of times.<br />All souls receive this gift as soon as they enter the other world. They can understand the speech of everyone in the whole family of nations, just as though they had been born in those nations, because they sense whatever a person is thinking. Not to mention other talents in which they excel even more dramatically.<br />That is why it happens after physical death that souls can converse and interact with everyone, no matter what the individual's region or language was.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the language of spirits and angels, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1637/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_234" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 234-245</a>.

Among the wonderful things in the other life is the fact that the speech of spirits with a man is in his native tongue, which they speak as readily and skillfully as if they had been born in the same 
land, and had been brought up with the same language; and this whether they are from Europe, from Asia, or from any other part of the globe. The case is the same with those who lived thousands of years 
ago, before the language in question had come into existence. The spirits indeed know no otherwise than that the language in which they speak with a man is their own, and that of their native land. 
The case is the same with other languages in which the man is skilled; but beyond these languages, the spirits cannot utter a syllable of any language, unless to do this is given them by the Lord immediately. 
Even little children who had died before they had been taught any language, speak in the same way.  [2] But the reason is that the language with which spirits are familiar is not a language 
of words, but is a language of ideas of thought; and this language is the universal of all languages; and when they are with a man, their ideas of thought fall into the words that are in the man, and 
this in a manner so correspondent and fitting that the spirits know no otherwise than that the words themselves are theirs, and that they are speaking in their own language; when yet they are speaking 
in that of the man. I have occasionally spoken with spirits concerning these matters. All souls, as soon as they enter into the other life, are endowed with the gift of being able to understand the 
speech of all who are in the whole world, precisely as if it were their native tongue, for they perceive whatever a man thinks. They are endowed with other faculties also that are still more excellent. 
Hence it is that souls, after the death of the body, can converse and associate with all, of whatever region or language they may have been. </p>

Among the marvels that occur in the next life is the fact that spirits speak to man in his own mother tongue. They speak it with the fluency and skill of one born in the same country and brought up using 
the same tongue. This is so whether they come from Europe, or from Asia, or from some other part of the world, including those who lived thousands of years before that tongue had come into being. 
Indeed when speaking to man the spirits know no other than that the language they are using is their own and that of their own country. The same is also the case with the foreign languages which a person 
has learned. But beyond these, spirits are not able to utter one sound of another language unless they are directly enabled to do so by the Lord. Even little children who have died before learning 
to talk in any language speak in the same way. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason for this is that the language with which spirits are familiar is not a language composed of words but a language composed of ideas comprising 
thought. This language is the universal of all languages; and when spirits are present with someone on earth the ideas comprising their thought fall into words which belong to that person's vocabulary. 
This takes place in such a corresponding and fitting manner that the spirits know no other than that those words are their own and that they are speaking in their own language, when in fact 
they are speaking in the person's language. I have spoken on several occasions to spirits about these matters. All souls, the moment they enter the next life, receive this gift of being able to understand 
what all people in any part of the world are saying, just as if they had been born among those people, for they perceive whatever a person is thinking. In addition to this they receive other abilities 
which are more perfect still. This explains why after death of the body souls are able to talk to and mix with all people, no matter what region these came from or what language they spoke. </p>

</p><b>1637.</b>
Inter mirabilia quae in altera vita existunt, est quod loquela spirituum cum homine sit in ejus vernacula, quam tam expedite et solerter loquuntur ac si nati fuissent in eadem terra et educati eadem 
lingua; et hoc sive ex Europa sint, sive ex Asia, sive ex alia parte orbis; similiter illi qui vixerunt ante millia annorum antequam lingua illa exstiterat; immo spiritus non aliter sciunt quam quod 
lingua qua cum homine loquuntur, sit eorum propria et patria; similiter fit cum aliis linguis quas callet homo; sed praeter illas, ne voculam alterius linguae possunt, uni hoc iis immediate datum sit 
a Domino, producere: etiam infantes qui antequam edocti aliquam linguam, decesserunt, similiter loquuntur: [2] sed causa est quia lingua quae spiritibus familiaris est, non est lingua vocum, sed est lingua 
idearum cogitationis; quae lingua est universalis omnium linguarum; et cum apud hominem sunt, ideae eorum cogitationis illabuntur in voces quae sunt apud hominem, et hoc tam correspondenter et adaptate 
ut spiritus non aliter sciant quam quod ipsae voces sint eorum, et quod ipsi loquantur lingua sua, cum tamen loquuntur lingua hominis: de his aliquoties cum spiritibus locutus sum: hac dote donantur 
omnes animae ut primum in alteram vitam veniunt, quod intelligere possint loquelas omnia qui in universo terrarum orbe sunt, prorsus sicut in illis nati fuissent, nam percipiunt quicquid homo cogitat; 
praeter alias facultates quae adhuc excellentiores sunt: inde est quod animae post mortem corporis cum omnibus cujuscumque regionis et linguae fuerint, colloqui et conversari possint. </p>
