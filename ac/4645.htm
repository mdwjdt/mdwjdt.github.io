Verses 6-8. And Esau took his women, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his acquisition, and all his beast, and all his purchase, which he had acquired in the land of 
Canaan, and went into a land from before Jacob his brother, For their substance [conquisitio] was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because 
of their acquisitions. And Esau dwelt in Mount Seir; Esau he is Edom. "And Esau took his women, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his acquisition, and all his beast, 
and all his purchase, which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went into a land from before Jacob his brother," signifies all things of Divine good and the derivative truth which He nevertheless 
had, with which there was correspondence in heaven, and from which is heaven (withdrawing from Jacob for the sake of the representation); "for their substance was too great," signifies on account 
of infinity; "for them to dwell together," signifies the representatives; "and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their acquisitions," signifies that all things cannot be described; 
"and Esau dwelt in Mount Seir," signifies the truth of natural good; "Esau he is Edom" signifies the Lord's Divine Human. </p>

Verses 6-8 And Esau took his wives (femina), and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his purchase which he had acquired in the land 
of Canaan, and went to a land away from Jacob his brother. For their acquirements were too many for them to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle. 
And Esau dwelt on Mount Seir, Esau being Edom. </p>
<p>'Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his purchase which 
he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from Jacob his brother' means all forms of Divine Good, and of Truth rooted in that Good, which were nevertheless His, with which there 
was correspondence in heaven and from which heaven existed. Esau's departure from Jacob took place for the sake of what was represented by his departure. 'For their acquirements were too many' means 
on account of the infinity of them. 'For them to dwell together' means the representatives. 'And the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle' means that it is impossible 
to describe them all. 'And Esau dwelt on Mount Seir' means the truth of Natural Good. 'Esau being Edom' means the Lord's Divine Human. </p>

Vers. 6-8.  Et accepit Esau feminas suas, et filios suos, et filias suas, et omnes animas domus suae, et acquisitionem suam, et omnem bestiam suam, et omnem emptionem suam, quae acquisivit in terra 
Canaan, et ivit ad terram a coram Jacobo fratre suo.  Quia fuit conquisitio eorum multa prae habitare simul, et non potuit terra peregrinationum eorum ferre eos a coram acquisitionibus eorum.  Et 
habitavit Esau in monte Seir; Esau ipse Edom.  `Accepit Esau feminas suas, et filios suos, et filias suas, et omnes animas domus suae, et acquisitionem suam, et omnem bestiam suam, et omnem emptionem 
suam, quae acquisivit in terra Canaan, et ivit ad terram a coram Jacobo fratre suo' significat omnia Divini Boni et Veri inde quae usque Ei, cum quibus correspondentia in caelo, et inde caelum; 
recedens a Jacobo ex causa repraesentationis: `quia fuit conquisitio eorum multa' significat ob infinitatem: `prae habitare simul' significat repraesentativa: `et non potuit terra peregrinationum 
eorum ferre eos a coram acquisitionibus eorum' significat quod omnia non possint describi: `et habitavit Esau in monte Seir' significat Boni Naturalis verum: `Esau ipse Edom' significat Divinum Humanum Domini. </p>
