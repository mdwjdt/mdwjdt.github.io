<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4288.</strong>目前所解释的这几节也涉及犹太和以色列民族，这个民族以“雅各”来命名，如前所述所示（<a href="4279.htm">4279</a>节）。就被称为内在历史意义的意义而言，“天黎明了，容我去吧”这句话表示在雅各的后代进入迦南地的代表之前，纯正的代表角色将离开他们。前面已经说明这个民族的性质，即他们当中没有内在敬拜，只有外在敬拜；也就是说，他们已经脱离了天上的婚姻，因而除了教会的代表外，教会无法在他们当中建立（<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>节）。<br />不过，要知道何为代表教会，何为教会代表。当外在敬拜中有内在敬拜时，代表教会就存在；当没有内在敬拜，但仍有外在敬拜时，教会的代表就存在。这二者有几乎一样的外在仪式，也就是说，一样的典章、一样的律法、一样的诫命。但在代表教会，外在与内在相对应，以至于它们合而为一；而在教会的代表，这种对应是不存在的，因为外在要么缺乏内在，要么与内在相悖。在代表教会中，属天和属灵之爱是至高无上的；但在教会的代表中，身体和世俗之爱是至高无上的。属天和属灵之爱是内在本身；但当属天或属灵之爱不存在，只有身体和世俗之爱时，外在缺乏内在。大洪水后的古教会就是一个代表教会；不过，建立在雅各后代当中的，只是一个教会的代表。<br />为了使二者之间的区别变得清楚明了，现举例予以说明。在代表教会，神性敬拜在山上进行，因为山表示属天之爱，在至高意义上表示主（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>节）；他们在山上举行敬拜时，便处于自己的神圣状态，因为那时他们居于属天之爱。在代表教会，神性敬拜也在树林中进行，因为树林表示属灵之爱，在至高意义上表示在这爱方面的主（<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>节）；他们在树林中举行敬拜时，便处于自己的神圣状态，因为那时他们处于属灵之爱。在代表教会，他们在举行神性敬拜时，便面向升起的太阳，因为“升起的太阳”也表示属天之爱（<a href="101.htm">101</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>节）。他们仰望月亮时，同样充满神圣的敬意，因为“月亮”表示属灵之爱（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。当他们仰望星空时，情形也一样，因为星空表示天使天堂或主的国度。在代表教会，他们有帐棚或会幕，并在里面举行神性敬拜，这是神圣的敬拜；因为“帐棚”或“会幕”表示爱与敬拜的神圣（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="3312.htm">3312</a>节）。此外还可举出其它无数例子。<br />在教会代表，神性敬拜一开始的确在山上举行，也在树林中举行；他们也会面向升起的太阳，仰望月亮和星辰，同样在帐棚或会幕里面举行敬拜。但由于他们处于没有内在的外在敬拜，也就是处于身体和世俗之爱，而非处于属天和属灵之爱，因而敬拜大山和树林本身，日月星辰，以及他们的帐棚或会幕，就这样使得在古教会很神圣的仪式沦为偶像崇拜，所以他们被限制在对他们所有人来说都一样的地方和习俗，也就是说，被限制在耶路撒冷所在的山上，最后在锡安所在之地，从那圣殿观望升起的太阳，还被限制在所有人共有的一个帐棚，被称为会幕，最终被限制在圣殿的约柜。这是为了当他们处于神圣的外在时，教会的代表能够存在。否则，他们必亵渎神圣事物。<br />从这些例子可以看出代表教会和教会代表之间有何区别。一般来说，代表教会的成员就其内层而言，与三层天堂相通，而这些外在事物充当其内层止于其上的基础。但那些属于教会代表的人就其内层而言，没有与天堂相通；然而，他们仍被保守在外在事物，因为外在事物能充当内层的基础。主的天意以奇迹般的方式成就这一切，旨在天堂与人类之间能通过教会的某种表象而建立某种联系。因为如果天堂与人类不通过教会的某种事物建立联系，人类必要灭亡。至于通过缺乏与内在事物相对应的外在事物建立起来的联系是何性质，这是不几句话就能说清楚的。蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在后面予以说明。</p>

These same words which have thus far been explained have regard also to the Jewish and Israelitish nation, which is named "Jacob" in the Word, as has been said and shown above (n. 4279). In that sense 
which is called the internal historical sense, by these words-"Let me go, for the dawn ariseth"-is signified that what is representative should depart from the posterity of Jacob, before they came into 
the representatives of the land of Canaan. It has been shown above what the character of that nation was, namely, that with them there was no internal worship, but only external; thus that the heavenly 
conjugial was separated from them, and therefore that no church could be instituted with them, but only the representative of a church (n.4281).  [2] But be it known what a representative church 
is, and what the representative of a church. A representative church is when there is internal worship in external, and the representative of a church when there is no internal worship, but nevertheless 
there is external. In both there are nearly similar outward rituals, that is, similar statutes, similar laws, and similar precepts. But in the representative church the externals correspond with 
the internals, so as to make a one; whereas in the representative of a church there is no correspondence, because the externals are either devoid of internals, or are at variance with them. In a representative 
church celestial and spiritual love is the principal, but in the representative of a church bodily and worldly love is the principal. Celestial and spiritual love is the internal itself; but 
where there is no celestial and spiritual love, but only bodily and worldly love, the external is devoid of an internal. The Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was a representative church; but 
that which was instituted among the posterity of Jacob was only the representative of a church.  [3] To make this evident let the distinction be illustrated by examples. In the Representative Church 
Divine worship took place on mountains, because mountains signified celestial love, and in the supreme sense the Lord (n. 795, 1430, 2722, 4210); and when they were holding worship on mountains, they 
were in their holy state, because they were at the same time in celestial love. In the Representative Church Divine worship took place also in groves, because groves signified spiritual love, and in 
the supreme sense the Lord as to this love (n. 2722); and when they were holding worship in groves, they were in their holy state, because at the same time in spiritual love. In the Representative Church 
when they were holding Divine worship, they turned their faces to the rising of the sun, because by the rising sun was also signified celestial love (n. 101, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643). 
And so when they looked at the moon they were in like manner penetrated with a certain holy reverence, because the moon signified spiritual love (n. 1529-1531, 2495, 4060). It was similar when they looked 
at the starry heaven, because this signified the angelic heaven or the Lord's kingdom. In the Representative Church they had tents or tabernacles, and Divine worship in them, and this holy; because 
tents or tabernacles signified the holy of love and worship (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312); and so in innumerable other things.  [4] In the representative of a church there was indeed in the beginning 
a like Divine worship upon mountains, and also in groves, and they also turned their faces toward the rising of the sun, and looked at the moon and the stars, and similarly held worship in tents 
or tabernacles. But as they were in external worship without internal, or in bodily and worldly love, and not in celestial and spiritual love, and thus worshiped the mountains and groves themselves, 
and the sun, moon, and stars, as also their tents or tabernacles, and thus made the rituals idolatrous which in the Ancient Church were holy, they were therefore restricted to what was common to all, 
namely, to the mountain where Jerusalem was, and at last where Zion was, and to the rising of the sun as seen thence and from the temple, and also to a tent in common, which was called the tent of meeting, 
and finally to the ark in the temple; and this to the intent that a representative of a church might exist when they were in a holy external; as otherwise they would have profaned holy things. 
 [5] From this it is evident what the distinction is between a representative church and a representative of a church; in general, that they who were of the representative church communicated with the 
three heavens as to their interiors, to which these external things served as a plane; but they who were in the representative of a church did not communicate with the heavens as to their interiors; 
but still the external things in which they were kept could serve as a plane, and this miraculously of the Lord's providence, to the intent that something of communication might exist between heaven 
and man, by means of some semblance of a church; for without the communication of heaven with man through something of a church, the human race would perish. What the correspondence of internal things 
is, cannot be told in few words, but will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in the following pages. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4288</b></p><p><b>4288.</b>
These same verses which have been explained so far also have regard to the Jewish and Israelitish nation which is called 'Jacob' in the Word, as stated and shown above in <a href="4279.htm">4279</a>. In the sense which is 
being called the internal historical the words 'Let me go, for the dawn is coming up' mean that the genuine representative role would depart from the descendants of Jacob before they entered into the 
representatives connected with the land of Canaan. The nature of that nation has been shown above, namely that among them no internal worship existed, only external worship; that is to say, they had become 
cut off from the heavenly marriage, and therefore no Church could be established among that nation, only that which was a representative of the Church, see <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But one must know what a 
representative Church is and what a representative of the Church is. A representative Church exists when internal worship is present within external, but a representative of the Church when no internal 
worship exists even though external does so. In both cases they observe very similar external practices, that is to say, they follow similar ordinances, laws, and commands. But in the representative 
Church external things correspond to internal so that they make one, whereas in a representative of the Church that correspondence does not exist because external things are either devoid of internal 
or else at variance with them. In the representative Church celestial and spiritual love is supreme, but in a representative of the Church bodily and worldly love is supreme. Celestial and spiritual 
love constitutes the internal itself, but when no celestial or spiritual love exists, only bodily and worldly, that which is external devoid of what is internal exists. The Ancient Church which existed 
after the Flood was a representative Church, but that which was established among the descendants of Jacob was merely a representative of the Church. But to make the difference between the two quite 
plain, let it be illustrated by examples. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the representative Church Divine worship took place on mountains because 'mountains' meant celestial love, and in the highest sense the Lord, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>; and when they held worship on mountains they were in their own holy place because they were at the same time abiding in celestial love. In the representative Church Divine worship also 
took place in groves because 'groves' meant spiritual love, and in the highest sense the Lord in regard to that love, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>; and when they held worship in groves they were in their own holy place because 
they were at the same time abiding in spiritual love. When they held Divine worship in the representative Church they used to turn their faces towards the rising of the sun because 'the rising sun' 
too meant celestial love, <a href="101.htm">101</a>,<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>. And when they looked up at the moon they were again filled with holy reverence because 'the moon' meant spiritual love, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, 
<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>. And the same applied when they looked up at the starry sky because this meant the angelic heaven or the Lord's kingdom. In the representative Church they had tents or tabernacles in which 
they held Divine worship, and this was holy worship because 'tents' or 'tabernacles' means the holiness of love and of worship, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="3312.htm">3312</a>. And countless other examples could be mentioned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In the representative of the Church Divine worship did indeed take place at first on mountains and also in groves. The practice also existed then of turning to face the rising of the sun, 
as well as that of beholding the moon and the stars. There was likewise worship in tents or tabernacles. But because their external worship was devoid of internal - that is, they were governed by bodily 
and worldly love and not by celestial and spiritual, and so worshipped the actual mountains or groves, and also the sun, moon, and stars, as well as their tents or tabernacles - those practices, 
which had been holy in the Ancient Church, were now made idolatrous by those belonging to a representative of the Church. They were therefore restricted to the same place and practices for them all, that 
is to say, to the mountain on which Jerusalem and at length Zion stood, where from the temple they beheld the rising of the sun, and also to one tent for them all, called the tent of meeting, and 
ultimately to the ark in the temple. They were restricted to these things to the end that a representative of the Church might come into being when they practiced what was outwardly holy. Otherwise they 
would have rendered holy things unholy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From these examples one may see what the difference is between a representative Church and a representative of the Church. In general, one may see that 
members of the representative Church communicated with the three heavens, and that they did so in things of an interior kind, for which external ones could serve as the foundation on which they rested. 
But those who belonged to a representative of the Church did not communicate with heaven in things of an interior kind. Yet the external things to which those people were limited were nevertheless 
able to serve as the foundation for interior ones. The Lord's Providence in a miraculous manner enabled this to be so, for the reason that some kind of communication might be established between heaven 
and mankind through what was a semblance of the Church. For without any communication of heaven with mankind by means of some kind of Church the human race would perish. But what the communication 
is like when it takes place through external things devoid of any correspondence with internal ones cannot be stated briefly. In the Lord's Divine mercy a statement is to be made about this later on. </p>

Eadem haec quae hactenus explicata sunt, etiam spectant gentem Judaicam et Israeliticam quae `Jacob' in Verbo nominatur, ut supra n. 4279 dictum et ostensum est; in illo sensu qui internus historicus 
vocatur, per haec, nempe, `mitte me quia ascendit aurora' significatur repraesentativum antequam venirent in terrae Canaanis repraesentativa, quod a Jacobi posteris discederet; </p>
<p>ostensum est supra 
qualis illa gens fuit, quod nempe apud illam nullus cultus internus fuerit sed solum externus, ita quod conjugiale caeleste ab illa separatum fuerit, ac ideo quod nulla Ecclesia apud illam institui 
potuerit sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, videatur n. 4281; [2] sed sciendum quid repraesentativa Ecclesia et quid repraesentativum Ecclesiae: repraesentativa Ecclesia est cum cultus internus 
est in externo, repraesentativum Ecclesiae autem est cum nullus cultus internus sed usque externus; </p>
<p>in utroque paene similia ritualia externa sunt {1}, nempe similia statuta, similes leges, et 
similia praecepta; sed in repraesentativa Ecclesia correspondent externa cum internis, sic ut unum faciant, at in repraesentativo Ecclesiae non datur correspondentia quia externa (o)vel sunt absque 
internus, vel dissident; in repraesentativa Ecclesia amor caelestis et spiritualis est principale, at in repraesentativo Ecclesiae est amor corporeus et mundanus principale; amor caelestis et spiritualis 
est ipsum internum {2}, ast ubi nullus amor caelestis et spiritualis, sed solum corporeus et mundanus, est externum absque interno; Antiqua Ecclesia quae fuit post diluvium, Ecclesia repraesentativa 
fuit, sed quae apud posteros Jacobi instituta, fuit modo Ecclesiae repraesentativum: [3] sed discrimen, ut pateat {3}, illustretur per exempla: in repraesentativa Ecclesia fuit cultus Divinus 
super montibus, quia `montes' significabant amorem caelestem, ac in supremo sensu Dominum, n. 795, 1430 {4}, 2722, 4210, et cum {5} super montibus cultum habebant, erant in suo sancto quia tunc 
simul in amore caelesti; in repraesentativa Ecclesia etiam fuit cultus Divinus in lucis, quia `luci' significabant amorem spiritualem, ac in supremo sensu Dominum quoad amorem illum, n. (x)2722, 
et tum in lucis cultum habebant, erant in suo sancto quia tunc simul in amore spirituali; in Ecclesia repraesentativa cum cultum Divinum haberent, facies suas ad orientem solis vertebant quia per 
`orientem solem' etiam amor caelestis significabatur, n. 101, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643; cum etiam aspiciebant lunam, similiter quadam sancta veneratione perfundebantur quia `luna' significabat 
amorem spiritualem, n. 1529-1531, 2495, 4060; pariter cum caelum sidereum quia hoc significabat caelum angelicum seu regnum Domini: in Ecclesia repraesentativa tentoria seu tabernacula habebant 
et in illis cultum Divinum, et illum sanctum, quia `tentoria seu tabernacula' significabant sanctum amoris et cultus n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312; ita in innumerabilibus aliis: in repraesentativo Ecclesiae, 
quidem in principio similiter fuit cultus Divinus super montibus et quoque in lucis, tum quoque erat aspectus versus orientem solis, ut et intuitio in lunam et ad astra, pariter cultus in 
tentoriis seu tabernaculis, at quia in (o)cultu externo erant absque interno, seu in amore corporeo et mundano, non autem in amore caelesti et spirituali, et sic ipsos montes et lucos {6} colerent, 
tum quoque solem, lunam, et astra, ut et sua tentoria seu tabernacula, et inde ritualia illa quae in Ecclesia Antiqua fuerunt sancta, idololatrica fecerunt; ideo restringebantur ad commune, nempe 
ad montem ubi Hierosolyma et tandem ubi Zion, adque orientem solis inde et e templo, tum quoque ad tentorium (o)commune, quod tentorium conventus (o)vocabatur, et denique ad arcam in templo; 
et haec ob causam ut repraesentativum Ecclesiae existeret cum in sancto externo essent, alioquin sancta profanavissent; [5] inde constare potest quodnam discrimen est inter Ecclesiam repraesentativam 
et Ecclesiae repraesentativum; in genere, quod qui ab Ecclesia repraesentativa fuerunt, communicarent cum tribus caelis quoad interiora, quibus pro plano inservirent externa; at qui in Ecclesiae 
repraesentativo, non communicarent eum caelis quoad interiora, sed usque externa in quibus tenebantur, possent inservire pro plano, et hoc miraculose ex Domini {7} Providentia, ob causam ut communicationis 
aliquid existeret inter caelum et hominem per aliquod instar Ecclesiae, nam absque communicatione caeli cum homine per aliquid Ecclesiae periret genus [humanum; sed qualis communicatio est 
per externa absque] correspondentia internorum {8}, non paucis dici potest; in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicendum.      @1 after utroque$      @2 i et amor corporeus et mundanus
