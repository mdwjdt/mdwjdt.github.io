<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4828.</strong>创世记38:6-10.犹大为长子珥娶妻，名叫他玛。犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华就叫他死了。犹大对俄南说，你当与你哥哥的妻子同房，向她尽你作小叔的本分，为你哥哥兴种。俄南知道那种不是他的，所以与哥哥的妻子同房的时候，便遗种在地上，免得给他哥哥留种。俄南所作的在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华也就叫他死了。<br />“犹大娶妻”表为他的后代所建的教会。“为长子珥”表信之虚假。“名叫他玛”表该教会的性质，即它是一个代表属灵和属天事物的教会。“犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶”表它沉浸在源于邪恶的虚假中。“耶和华就叫他死了”表没有教会的代表。“犹大对俄南说”表为了保存教会的代表。“你当与你哥哥的妻子同房，向她尽你作小叔的本分”表好叫它能得以延续。“为你哥哥兴种”表以免教会灭亡。“俄南知道那种不是他的”表厌恶和仇恨。“所以与哥哥的妻子同房的时候，便遗种在地上”表婚姻之爱的反面。“免得给他哥哥留种”表这样便没有延续。“俄南所作的在耶和华眼中看为恶”表这违反神性次序。“耶和华也就叫他死了”表教会的代表又没了。</p>

Verses 6-10. And Judah took a woman for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. And Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah caused him to die. And Judah said unto Onan, 
Come to thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother. And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass when he came to his 
brother's wife, and he destroyed it to the earth, that he might not give seed to his brother. And that which he did was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and He caused him also to die. "And Judah took a 
woman," signifies the church which was for his posterity; "for Er his firstborn," signifies falsity of faith; "and her name was Tamar," signifies the quality of the church, that it was a church representative 
of spiritual and celestial things; "and Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah," signifies that it was in the falsity of evil; "and Jehovah caused him to die," signifies that 
there was no representative of the church; "and Judah said unto Onan," signifies to preserve a representative of the church; "Come to thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto 
her," signifies that it should be continued; "and raise up seed to thy brother," signifies lest the church should perish; "and Onan knew that the seed would not be his," signifies aversion and hatred; 
"and it came to pass when he came to his brother's wife, and he destroyed it to the earth," signifies what is contrary to conjugial love; "that he might not give seed to his brother," signifies that 
thus there was no continuation; "and that which he did was evil in the eyes of Jehovah," signifies that it was contrary to the Divine order; "and He caused him also to die," signifies that there was 
also no representative of the church. </p>

Verses 6-10 And Judah took a wife (mulier) for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. And Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah caused him to die. And Judah said to Onan, 
Come [in] to your brother's wife (uxor) and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed for your brother. And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and so it was, when he 
came [in] to his brother's wife (uxor), that he spilled it on the ground,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so that he should not provide seed for his brother. And what he had done was evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and He caused him 
to die also. </p>
<p>'Judah took a wife' means the Church which was for his descendants. 'For Er his firstborn' means falsity of faith. 'And her name was Tamar' means the essential nature of the Church - 
a Church representative of spiritual and celestial things. 'And Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah' means that it was immersed in falsity springing from evil. 'And Jehovah caused him 
to die' means that there was no representative of the Church. 'And Judah said to Onan' means so as to preserve a representative of the Church. 'Come [in] to your brother's wife and perform the duty 
of a husband's brother to her' means that that representative might be continued. 'And raise up seed for your brother' means so that the Church does not perish. 'And Onan knew that the seed would not 
be his' means a loathing and hatred. 'And so it was, when he came [in] to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground' means the reverse of conjugial love. 'So that he should not provide seed 
for his brother' means that this being so there was no continuation. 'And what he had done was evil in the eyes of Jehovah' means that it was contrary to Divine order. 'And He caused him to die also' 
means that again there was no representative of the Church.

Vers. 6-10.  Et accepit Jehudah mulierem Ero primogenito suo, et nomen illius Tamar.  Et fuit Er primogenitus Jehudae malus in oculis Jehovae, et mori fecit eum Jehovah.  Et dixit Jehudah ad Onan, 
Veni ad uxorem fratris tui, et leviratum praesta illi, et excita semen fratri tuo.  Et novit Onan quod non sibi esset semen, et fuit, cum venit ad uxorem fratris sui, et perdidit ad terram, ut non 
daret semen fratri suo.  Et fuit malum in oculis Jehovae quod fecit, et mori fecit etiam eum.  `Accepit Jehudah mulierem' significat Ecclesiam quae posteritati ejus: `Ero primogenito suo' significat

et odium: `et fuit, cum venit ad uxorem fratris sui, et perdidit ad terram' significat contrarium amori conjugiali: `ut non daret semen fratri suo' significat quod sic nulla continuatio: `et fuit 
malum in oculis Jehovae quod fecit' significat quod contra ordinem Divinum: `et mori fecit etiam eum' significat quod etiam Ecclesiae repraesentativum nullum. </p>
