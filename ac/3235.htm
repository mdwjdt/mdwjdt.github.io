<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3235节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3235.</strong>“亚伯拉罕又娶了一个妻子，名叫基土拉”表亚伯拉罕所代表的主所经历的另一个状态；亚伯拉罕和撒拉代表主的神性属天人；而亚伯拉罕和基土拉则代表主的神性属灵人。 这从目前有关亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉的阐述和说明，以及此处有关亚伯拉罕和基土拉的叙述清楚可知。由于我们说过，亚伯拉罕在此代表主的另一个状态，亚伯拉罕和撒拉代表主的神性属天人，而亚伯拉罕和基土拉则代表主的神性属灵人，故有必要知道何谓神性属天人，何谓神性属灵人。<br />神性属天人和神性属灵人与那些接受主神性的人有关，因为主照着接受者的性质而显现给每个人。这一点从前面所述（<a href="1838.htm">1838</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>节）清楚可知，也可从以下事实很明显地看出来，即：主以一种方式向属天之人显现，以另一种方式向属灵之人显现，因为祂向属天之人显为一轮太阳，而向属灵之人显为一轮月亮（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="1838.htm">1838</a>节）。主向属天之人显为一轮太阳，是因为他们具有属天之爱，即具有对主之爱；向属灵之人显为一轮月亮，是因为他们具有属灵之爱，即具有对邻之仁。这种区别就像白天日光和夜晚月光的区别，还像这二者的热之间的区别，而热使得地上万物生长。这就是创世记第一章中这些话的意思：<br />于是神造了两个大光，大的管昼，小的管夜。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.16.htm">1:16</a>）<br />一般来说，主的国是属天和属灵的。也就是说，它由那些属天之人和那些属灵之人组成。正因主的神性向属天之人显为属天，向属灵之人显为属灵，故我们在此说，亚伯拉罕和撒拉代表主的神性属天人，亚伯拉罕和基土拉代表主的神性属灵人。但几乎没有人知道何为属天的，何为属灵的，或谁是属天的，谁是属灵的，故请参阅有关他们的阐述和说明，即：何为属天的，何为属灵的（<a href="1155.htm">1155</a>，<a href="1577.htm">1577</a>，<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>，<a href="2227.htm">2227</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）。谁是属天的，谁是属灵的（<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。属天之人是主的样式，出于爱行善；属灵之人是主的形像，出于信行善（<a href="50.htm">50</a>-<a href="52.htm">52</a>，<a href="1013.htm">1013</a>节）。属天之人通过良善直觉真理，他们从不推理真理（<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="1121.htm">1121</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。在属天之人里面，良善被植入在其心智的意愿部分；而在属灵之人里面，良善被植入在其心智的理解力部分；对属灵之人而言，一个新意愿在理解力部分被造（<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="897.htm">897</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>节）。属天之人出于良善本身看到无限制的事物，而属灵之人因推理事情是否如此，故无法抵达属天之人之光所发散的最远边界（<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>节）。与属天之人相比，属灵之人居于模糊中（<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。主降世是为了拯救属灵之人（<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）。</p>

And Abraham added, and took a woman. That this signifies another state of the Lord, whom Abraham represents, and that Abraham and Sarah represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial, and Abraham and 
Keturah as to the Divine spiritual, is evident from the things hitherto said and shown concerning Abraham and Sarah his wife, and from those here related concerning Abraham and Keturah. But as it is 
said that Abraham here represents another state of the Lord, and that Abraham and Sarah represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial, but Abraham and Keturah the Lord as to the Divine spiritual, it 
should be known what the Divine celestial is, and what the Divine spiritual. [2] The Divine celestial and the Divine spiritual are such in respect to those who receive the Divine of the Lord, for the 
Lord appears to everyone according to the nature of him who receives, as may be seen from what has been said above (n. 1838, 1861), and is clearly manifest from the fact that the Lord appears in one 
way to the celestial, but in another to the spiritual; for to the celestial He appears as a sun, but to the spiritual as a moon (n. 1529-1531, 1838). The Lord appears to the celestial as a sun, because 
they are in celestial love, that is, in love to the Lord; but to the spiritual as a moon, because they are in spiritual love, that is, in charity toward the neighbor. The difference is like that between 
the light of the sun in the daytime and the light of the moon by night; it is also like the difference between the heat of the one and the heat of the other, from which springs vegetation. This 
is what is meant in the first chapter of Genesis by the words: </p>
<p>     And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night (Gen. 1:16). [3] Speaking 
generally, the Lord's kingdom is both celestial and spiritual; that is, it consists of those who are celestial, and of those who are spiritual. And it is because the Divine of the Lord appears to the 
celestial as celestial, and to the spiritual as spiritual, that it is here said that Abraham and Sarah represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial, and that Abraham and Keturah represented Him as 
to the Divine spiritual. But as scarcely any know what the celestial is and what the spiritual, or who the celestial and the spiritual are, see what has already been said and shown concerning them, 
namely: What the celestial is, and what the spiritual (n. 1155, 1577, 1824, 2048, 2184, 2227, 2507): Who are celestial and who are spiritual (n. 2088, 2669, 2708, 2715): That the celestial man is a likeness 
of the Lord and does good from love, and the spiritual man is an image of the Lord and does good from faith (n. 50-52, 1013): That the celestial perceive truth from good, and that they never reason 
concerning truth (n. 202, 337, 607, 895, 1121, 2715): That in the celestial man good is implanted in his will part, but in the spiritual man it is implanted in his intellectual part, and that in 
this part a new will is created in those who are spiritual (n. 863, 875, 895, 897, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256): That the celestial from good itself see indefinite things, but that the spiritual, because 
they reason whether a thing is so, cannot attain to the first boundary of the light of the celestial (n. 2718): That the spiritual are in relative obscurity (n. 1043, 2708, 2715): That the Lord came 
into the world in order to save the spiritual (n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834). </p>

'Abraham took another wife' means a further state which the Lord, whom Abraham represents, passed through - for 'Abraham and Sarah' represented the Lord as regards the Divine Celestial, 'Abraham and 
Keturah' the Lord as regards the Divine Spiritual. This is clear from what has been stated and shown so far about Abraham and his wife Sarah, and from what is recorded here about Abraham and Keturah. 
But as it is said that Abraham here represents a further state which the Lord passed through, and that Abraham and Sarah represented the Lord as regards the Divine Celestial, whereas Abraham and Keturah 
did so as regards the Divine Spiritual, one needs to know what is meant by the Divine Celestial and by the Divine Spiritual. The Divine Celestial and the Divine Spiritual have to do with those people 
who receive the Lord's Divine, for the Lord is seen by everyone according to the character of the recipient, as becomes clear from what has been stated in <a href="1838.htm">1838</a>, <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, and is quite evident from the 
fact that the Lord appears to celestial people in one way but to spiritual in another. For He appears as the sun to those who are celestial, but as the moon to those who are spiritual, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="1838.htm">1838</a>. 
The Lord appears to celestial people as the sun because in them celestial love, which is love to the Lord, is present, but to spiritual people as the moon because in these spiritual love, which is charity 
towards the neighbour, is present. The difference is like that between the light of the sun during the daytime and the light of the moon at night, and also between the warmth of both which causes 
things in the ground to grow. These are what were meant in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> by the words, </p>
<blockquote>
And God made the two great Lights, the greater Light to have dominion over the day, and the lesser Light to have 
dominion over the night. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%201:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 1:16</a>.

 The Lord's kingdom is in general celestial and spiritual, that is, it consists of those who are celestial and of those who are spiritual. And because the Lord's 
Divine appears to those who are celestial as being celestial, but to those who are spiritual as being spiritual, it is therefore said that Abraham and Sarah represented the Lord as regards the Divine 
Celestial, but Abraham and Keturah as regards the Divine Spiritual. But as scarcely anyone knows what the celestial is or what the spiritual, and who they are who are celestial or spiritual, please 
see what has been stated and shown about them already in the following places: </p>

`Addidit Abraham, et accepit mulierem': quod significet alterum statum Domini, quem Abraham repraesentat, et quod Abraham et Sarah repraesentaverint Dominum quoad Divinum Caeleste, Abraham et Keturah 
{1}quoad Divinum Spirituale, constat (c)ex illis quae {2}hactenus de Abrahamo et ejus uxore Sarah dicta et ostensa sunt, et (c)ex illis quae de Abrahamo et Keturah hic memorantur: sed quia dicitur quod 
Abraham hic alterum statum Domini repraesentet, et quod Abraham et Sarah Dominum quoad Divinum Caeleste, at Abraham et Keturah Dominum quoad Divinum Spirituale, sciendum quid sit Divinum Caeleste 
et quid Divinum Spirituale; Divinum Caeleste et Divinum Spirituale se habet respective ad illos qui recipiunt Divinum Domini, nam Dominus apparet unicuique qualis est qui recipit, ut constare potest ab 
illis quae n. 1838, 1861 dicta sunt, ac patet manifeste ex eo quod Dominus aliter appareat caelestibus, aliter vero spiritualibus; caelestibus enim apparet ut sol, spiritualibus autem ut luna, n. 1529-1531, 
1838; caelestibus apparet Dominus ut sol, quia illi in amore caelesti sunt, hoc est, in amore in Dominum; spiritualibus autem ut luna, quia illi in amore spirituali sunt, hoc est, in charitate

et est spirituale, hoc est, consistit ex caelestibus et ex spiritualibus; et quia Domini Divinum apparet caelestibus ut caeleste, et spiritualibus ut spirituale, inde est quod dicatur quod Abraham 
et Sarah repraesentaverint Dominum quoad Divinum caeleste, {3}et Abraham et Keturah {4}quoad Divinum spirituale. Sed quia vix alicui notum est quid caeleste et quid spirituale, tum quinam illi sunt,
