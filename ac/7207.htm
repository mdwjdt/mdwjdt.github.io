<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7207.</strong>“我要以你们为我的百姓”表他们将被添加到天上那些在那里事奉主的人当中。这从“以为百姓”的含义清楚可知，“以为百姓”当由耶和华或主来说时，是指接收到那些在天堂里的人当中；天堂里的人被称为“主的百姓或人民”，他们在世时同样被如此称呼，因为就其灵魂而言，那时他们也在天堂（参看<a href="687.htm">687</a>，<a href="697.htm">697</a>，<a href="3255.htm">3255</a>，<a href="4067.htm">4067</a>，<a href="4073.htm">4073</a>，<a href="4077.htm">4077</a>节）。这些话之所以表示那些属于属灵教会的人将被添加到天上那些在那里事奉主的人当中，是因为在主降临之前，他们被留在低地，当主复活时，就被提入天堂，那时被添加到那些事奉主的人当中（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7090.htm">7090</a>e节）。</p>

And I will take you to Me for a people. That this signifies that they shall be added to those in heaven who serve the Lord there, is evident from the signification of "taking for a people," when said 
by Jehovah or the Lord, as being to receive among those who are in heaven; for they who are in heaven are called the "people of the Lord," and the same also when they are in the world, because as to 
their souls they are then also in heaven (see n. 687, 697, 3255, 4067, 4073, 4077). That by these words is signified that they who are of the spiritual church shall be added to those in heaven who there 
serve the Lord, is because before the Lord's coming they had been detained in the lower earth, and were uplifted into heaven when the Lord rose again, and were then added to those who serve the Lord 
(n. 6854, 6914, 7090). </p>

'And I will take you to Myself as a people' means that they will be added to those in heaven who serve the Lord there. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking as a people', when said by Jehovah or 
the Lord, as receiving among those who are in heaven. For those in heaven are called the Lord's people, which they are also called when they are in the world because so far as their souls are concerned 
they are at that time too in heaven, see <a href="687.htm">687</a>, <a href="697.htm">697</a>, <a href="3255.htm">3255</a>, <a href="4067.htm">4067</a>, <a href="4073.htm">4073</a>, <a href="4077.htm">4077</a>. The reason why the words under consideration here mean that those who belong to the spiritual Church will be added to those 
in heaven who serve the Lord there is that before the Lord's Coming those people were held back on the lower earth, and were raised into heaven when the Lord rose again, at which point they were added 
to those there who serve the Lord, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7090.htm">7090</a> (end). </p>

</p><b>7207.</b>
`Et accipiam vos Mihi ad populum': quod significet quod illi adjicientur (c)illis in caelo qui ibi Domino serviunt, constat ex significatione `accipere in populum' cum hoc dicitur a Jehovah seu Domino, 
quod sit accipere inter illos qui in caelo sunt, nam qui ibi sunt populus Domini vocantur, etiam iidem cum in mundo sunt, nam (x)quoad animas suas tunc quoque in caelo sunt, videatur n. 687, 697, 
3255, 4067, (x)4073, 4077.  Quod per illa verba significetur quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali adjicientur iis in caelo qui ibi Domino serviunt, est quia illi ante Adventum Domini detenti fuerunt in 
inferiore terra, et elevati in caelum cum Dominus resurrexit, et tunc adjecti iis ibi qui Domino serviunt, videatur n. 6854, 6914, (x)7090 fin. </p>
