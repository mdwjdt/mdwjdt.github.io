<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>140.</strong>“一个看似属于他的帮手”表人的自我，这从自我的性质和后面的故事可知。此处所论述的教会中人具有良善之性，主于是许了他们，但这自我只是看似属于他，故经上说“一个看似属于他的帮手”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]140.</strong> A key to the reason why an aid that seemed to be his symbolizes a sense of autonomy lies in the nature of autonomy and in the story that follows. Since the people in the church being discussed here had good character, they were granted self-direction, but of a kind that only appeared to be theirs, which is why the verse says the aid seemed to be his. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 140</b></p><p><b>140.</b>
That by "a help as with him" is signified man's Own, is evident both from the nature of this Own, and from what follows. As however the man of the church who is here treated of was well disposed, an 
Own was granted him, but of such a kind that it appeared as it were his own, and therefore it is said "a help as with him." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 140</b></p><p><b>140.</b>
That 'a help suitable for him' means the proprium becomes clear from the nature of the proprium, and from what follows. But because the member of the Church dealt with here was inherently well-disposed, 
he was granted a proprium. But it [only] appeared to be his own, which is why it is called 'a help suitable for him'.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 140</b>
</p><b>140.</b>
Quod per 'auxilium tanquam apud illum' significetur proprium, ex natura proprii et ex sequentibus constare potest: sed quia hic homo Ecclesiae de quo nunc agitur, erat bonus indole, ei proprium concessum 
est, sed tale ut appareret sicut ejus, quare dicitur 'auxilium tanquam apud illum.'
