<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4282节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4282.</strong>创世记32:26-28.那人说，天黎明了，容我去吧！雅各说，你不给我祝福，我就不容你去。那人对他说，你名叫什么？他说，雅各。那人说，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列，因为作为君王，你与神与人较力，都得了胜。<br />“那人说，天黎明了，容我去吧”表当结合即将来临时，试探就会结束。“雅各说，你不给我祝福，我就不容你去”表结合就要产生。“那人对他说，你名叫什么？他说，雅各”表出于真理所行良善的性质。“那人说，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列”表现在的神性属天-属灵层，因为“以色列”是指在属世层里面的属天-属灵之人，因而是指属世人，而属天-属灵之人本身，也就是理性人，是“约瑟”。“因为作为君王，你与神与人较力，都得了胜”表在针对真理与良善的争战中屡屡获胜。<br />就论述雅各及其后代的内在历史意义而言，这些话的意思如下：“那人说，天黎明了，容我去吧”表在雅各的后代进入迦南地的代表之前，纯正的代表角色将离开他们。“雅各说，你不给我祝福，我就不容你去”表他们坚持作代表。“那人对他说，你名叫什么？他说，雅各”表他们是雅各的后代，连同他们的性质。“那人说，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列”表他们若不凭着赋予他们的新性质，就无法作为雅各（的后代）来代表。“因为作为君王，你与神与人较力，都得了胜”表由于他们的恶欲和幻想中的顽固不化。</p>

Verses 26-28. And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said, I will not let thee go unless thou bless me. And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name 
shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed. "And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth," signifies that temptation ceased 
when conjunction was at hand; "and he said, I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me," signifies that conjunction was to be effected; "and he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob" 
signifies the quality of good from truth; "and he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel," signifies the Divine celestial spiritual now; "Israel" is the celestial spiritual man which 
is in the natural, and thus is natural; the celestial spiritual man itself, which is rational, is "Joseph;" "for as a prince hast thou contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed," signifies 
continual victories in combats as to truths and goods.  [2] In the internal historical sense, in which Jacob and his posterity are treated of, by the same words are signified the things which follow; 
by "Let me go, for the dawn ariseth," is signified that what was representative before they came into representatives of the land of Canaan should depart from the posterity of Jacob; by "and he said, 
I will not let thee go unless thou bless me," is signified that they would insist upon being representative; by "and he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob," is signified that they 
were the posterity of Jacob with their quality; by "and he said, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel," is signified that they could not represent as Jacob, but as from a new quality 
given them; by "for as a prince hast thou contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed," is signified because of the contumacy which was in their cupidities and phantasies. </p>

Verses 26-28 And he' said, Let me go, for the dawn is coming up. And he said, I will not let you go unless you bless me. And he<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob. And he' said, Your 
name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince you have contended with God and with men, and have prevailed. </p>
<p>'He said, Let me go, for the dawn is coming up' means that the temptation 
came to an end when the joining together was at hand. 'And he said, I will not let you go unless you bless me' means that a joining together was to take place. 'And he said to him, What is your name? 
And he said, Jacob' means the essential nature of good done from truth. 'And he said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel' means the Divine celestial-spiritual at this point, for 
'Israel' is the celestial-spiritual man within the natural, and so is the natural man, whereas the celestial-spiritual man proper - that is, the rational man - is 'Joseph'. 'For as a prince you have 
contended with God and with men, and have prevailed' means repeated victories in conflicts over truths and goods. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the internal historical sense in which Jacob and his descendants are the subject 
the same words have the following meaning: 'Let me go, for the dawn is coming up' means that the genuine representative role would depart from the descendants of Jacob before they entered into the 
representatives connected with the land of Canaan. 'And he said, I will not let you go unless you bless me' means that they insisted on being representative. 'And he said to him, What is your name? 
And he said, Jacob' means that they were the descendants of Jacob - together with their essential nature. 'And he said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel' means that they could not 
as [the descendants of] Jacob play the representative part, except by virtue of the new nature that was imparted to them. 'For as a prince you have contended with God and with men, and have prevailed' 
means on account of the stubborn perverseness which was a product of their evil desires and of false delusions.

Vers. 26-28.  Et dixit, Mitte me quia ascendit aurora; et dixit, Non mittam te quin benedixeris mihi.  Et dixit ad eum, Quid nomen tuum? et dixit, Jacob.  Et dixit, Non Jacob dicetur amplius nomen 
tuum quin Israel, quia ut princeps contendisti cum Deo, et cum hominibus, et praevaluisti. `Dixit, Mitte me, quia ascendit aurora' significat quod tentatio desiit cum conjunctio adesset: `et dixit, 
Non mittam te quin benedixeris mihi' significat quod conjungendum: `et dixit ad eum, Quid nomen tuum? et dixit, Jacob' significat quale boni a vero: `et dixit, Non Jacob dicetur amplius nomen tuum 
quin Israel' significat Divinum caeleste spirituale nunc; est Israel caelestis spiritualis homo qui in naturali, ita naturalis; ipse caelestis spiritualis homo qui rationalis, est `Josephus': `quia 
ut princeps contendisti cum Deo et cum hominibus, et praevaluisti' significat continuas victorias in pugnis quoad vera et bona.      In sensu interno historico in quo agitur de Jacobo et ejus posteris, 
per eadem significantur haec; per quod `mitte me quia ascendit aurora' significatur repraesentativum, antequam venirent in terrae Canaanis repraesentativa, quod a Jacobi posteris discederet: 
per `et dixit, Non mittam te quin benedixeris mihi' significatur quod instarent ut essent repraesentativi: per `et dixit ad eum, Quid nomen tuum? et dixit, Jacob' significatur quod essent posteri 
Jacobi cum quali eorum: per `et dixit, Non Jacob dicetur amplius nomen tuum quin Israel' significatur quod non repraesentare possent ut `Jacob,' sed ut ex novo dato quali: per `quia ut princeps 
contendisti cum Deo et cum hominibus, et praevaluisti' significatur ob contumaciam quae eorum cupiditatibus et phantasiis {1}.      @1 A continues with a large (, after which is Hos. xii 4, 5 [AV 
3, 4] ubi [ ] [on] significat potentiam, conatum, ita contumaciam, tum quoque planctum, et maerorem, seu dolorem.      We find here an interesting glimpse of Swedenborg's Bible study. It is the only 
case in AC where he quotes the actual Hebrew.  In his copy of Sch, at Hos. xii 4, he underlines in robore suo potenter pugnavit and below writes Beza: principem se gessit$ </p>
