<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1668节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1668．</strong>“到十三年就背叛了”表童年试探的开始。这从“十三年”和“背叛”的含义清楚可知，十三年介于十二和十四之间。前面解释了“十二”的含义，下文会解释“十四”的含义。“十三”是没有试探和有试探之间的间隔。当背叛用来论及人里面的邪恶，或恶灵时，当邪恶或恶灵处于顺服状态，或事奉，然后开始起来攻击时，“背叛”的含义就变得很清楚了。<br />邪恶或恶灵背叛的程度视渴望被良善与真理主导之人确认某种恶与假，即恶欲与虚假渗入他的良善与真理的程度而定。恶灵的生命在于恶欲和虚假，天使的生命则在于良善和真理；侵扰和冲突由此产生。凡拥有良知的人都是这种情况，拥有直觉的主在孩提时更是如此。那些有良知的人会有一种隐痛，而那些有直觉的人则会产生剧痛；直觉越内在，痛苦越加剧。由此可见，与世人的试探相比，拥有内在和至内在直觉的主的试探是何性质。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1668.</strong> And in the thirteenth year they rebelled symbolizes the threshold of his trials in youth, as can be seen from the symbolism of the thirteenth year and of rebelling.<br />The thirteenth year is right between the twelfth and fourteenth. The symbolism of twelve has already been given, and the symbolism of fourteen appears below. The point halfway between times free of trial and times full of trial is thirteen.<br />The symbolism of rebelling can be seen from its use in relation to the evils (or evil spirits) present in us when they are enslaved and subservient but then start to rise up and make trouble.<br />[2] The extent of rebellion by our evils (or the evil spirits) depends on the extent to which we justify any evil or falsity in ourselves, despite our desire to dedicate ourselves to goodness and truth. To put it another way, their rebellion depends on the extent to which corrupt desires and false ideas worm their way into our good impulses and true ideas. Corrupt desires and false ideas are what evil spirits place their life in; good impulses and true ideas are what angels put their life in. This gives rise to trouble and conflict. It arises in everyone who has a conscience, and it arose even more intensely in the Lord when he was young, since he had an innate perception [of right and wrong]. Those who have conscience sense the trouble and conflict as a dull ache, but those who have perception feel it as a sharp pain; and the deeper their perception, the sharper the pain. This suggests how much worse the Lord's trials were than ours, since he had interior and inmost perception. </p>

And in the thirteenth year they rebelled. That this signified the beginning of temptations in childhood, is evident from the signification of "the thirteenth year," and from the signification of "rebelling." 
The thirteenth year is intermediate between the twelfth and the fourteenth. What is signified by "twelve" has been stated; and what by "fourteen" will be stated presently. The intermediate between 
no temptation and temptation is "thirteen." What "rebelling" signifies may be seen when it is predicated of the evils in a man, or of evil spirits, when they have been in subjection or are serving, 
and begin to rise up and infest.  [2] Evils or evil spirits rebel in proportion as the man who desires to be in good and truth confirms in himself any evils and falsities, that is, in proportion 
as cupidities and falsities insinuate themselves into his goods and truths. In cupidities and falsities is the life of evil spirits, and in goods and truths is the life of angels; and hence come infestation 
and combat. This is so with all who have conscience; and much more was it the case with the Lord when a child, who had perception. With those who have conscience there arises therefrom a dull pain; 
but with those who have perception, a sharp one, and the more interior the perception is, the sharper is the pain. From this we may see what was the nature of the Lord's temptation in comparison 
with that of men, for He had interior and inmost perception. </p>

'And in the thirteenth year they rebelled' means the onset of temptations in childhood. This is clear from the meaning of 'the thirteenth year' and from the meaning of 'rebelling' - the thirteenth year 
coming between the twelfth and fourteenth. What is meant by twelve has been stated already, and what is meant by fourteen is to follow. 'Thirteen' is the interval between the time when there is no 
temptation and the time when there is. What 'rebelling' means becomes clear when it is used in reference to the evils present with a person, or to evil spirits, when they have been held in subjection 
or are subservient and then start to rise up and infest. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Evils, or evil spirits, are in rebellion to the extent that a person who wishes to be governed by goods and truths confirms within himself 
certain evils and falsities, that is, to the extent that evil desires and falsities introduce themselves into his goods and truths. It is in evil desires and falsities that the life of evil spirits 
consists, but in goods and truths that the life of angels consists; and from this, infestation and conflict arise. This is so with all who have conscience, and was all the more so with the Lord when 
a boy, who had perception. With those who have conscience a dull pain arises, but with those who have perception intense pain; and the more interior the perception, the more intense is that pain. From 
this it becomes clear what the temptation of the Lord, who had interior and inmost perception, was like in comparison with men's. </p>

</p><b>1668.</b>
'Et tertio decimo anno rebellarunt':  quod significet principium tentationum in pueritia, constat a significatione 'tertii decimi anni' et a significatione 'rebellare'; 'tertius decimus annus' est intermedius 
inter duodecim et quatuordecim; quid per duodecim significatur, dictum est, et quid per quatuordecim sequitur; intermedium inter nullam tentationem et tentationem est 'tredecim': quid 'rebellare' 
significat, constare potest, cum praedicatur de malis apud hominem aut de malis spiritibus, quando subjugati sunt aut serviunt, ac incipiunt exsurgere et infestare; [2] mala seu mali spiritus in 
tantum rebellant, in quantum homo qui in bonis et veris esse vult, confirmat apud se aliqua mala et falsa, seu in quantum ejus bonis et veris se insinuant cupiditates et falsitates; in his est vita 
spirituum malorum, in bonis autem et veris est vita angelorum, inde infestatio et pugna; hoc apud omnes qui conscientiam habent, et adhuc magis apud Dominum cum puer, Qui perceptionem; apud illos qui 
habent conscientiam, oritur inde dolor mutus, at apud illos qui perceptionem, dolor acutus, et quo interior perceptio, eo acutior; inde qualis tentatio Domini prae hominum fuerit, constare potest, Qui 
perceptionem interiorem et intimam habuit. </p>
