<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第782节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>782.</strong>到目前为止，所阐述的主题如下：直到11节解释了教会被保存在那些被称为挪亚的人当中；然后首先在本节经文中描述了这个教会的状态，如已解释过的；之后描述了该教会状态的性质。个别小节，甚至个别句子象征了其状态的特征。由于现在的主题是教会的状态，所以前面所说的内容又重复出现，甚至重复了两次。也就是说，此处的经文说“凡要进入的，就是凡有血肉的，有公有母，都进去了”，而刚才那一节经文说“它们都到挪亚那里，进入方舟，凡有血肉的，都一对一对的”。在圣言中，这种重复表示，所阐述的是另一种状态。否则，就如人们所理解的，这种重复毫无意义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]782.</strong> The discussion so far, to verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_782/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_15" target=_top>15</a>,{*1} has centered on the church and its preservation in the people referred to as Noah. It now turns to conditions in the church and a depiction of them. At first the conditions are depicted as being those already explained. Then the nature of those conditions is portrayed. The individual verses and in fact the individual words suggest this church's particular circumstances.<br />Because conditions in the church are the present topic, the verse repeats what came just above, and repeats it twice. It says, "And those entering — a male and a female of all flesh — entered," while the very last verse said, "And they entered to Noah in the ark, two each and two each of all flesh." Repetition like this in the Word signals the fact that a different state is being discussed. If it did not, the repetition would be completely pointless, as anyone can see.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_782/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_11" target=_top>11</a>.

Thus far, down to verse 11, the church has been described as having been preserved in those who were called "Noah." The state of the church then follows, which is described, and first in this passage, 
as already explained. Then is described the quality of this state of the church. The single verses and even single words involve peculiarities of its state. And because the state of the church is now 
treated of, what was said just before is repeated, being said twice; here, in the words "and they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh;" while in the verse just preceding it is said, "and 
they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two, of all flesh." This repetition in the Word signifies that another state is treated of. Otherwise, as anyone may comprehend, it would be an entirely 
useless repetition. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 782</b></p><p><b>782.</b>
The subject so far has been as follows: Down to verse 11 explains that the Church was preserved among those called Noah. Then comes a description of the state of the Church - first of all in this present 
section, as has been explained. After that comes a description of the nature of the state of this Church. individual verses, indeed individual words, embody the specific features of its state. And 
since the subject at present is the state of the Church, what has been said already just above is repeated, indeed repeated twice over. That is to say, 'And those who were going in, male and female 
of all flesh, went in', repeats twice over the statement made in the previous verse, 'And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two, of all flesh'. The meaning of such repetition in the Word is that 
a different state is being dealt with. Otherwise, as anyone can appreciate, the repetition would be utterly pointless. </p>

Actum est huc usque ad vers. 11 de Ecclesia quod conservata sit in his qui Noahus dicti; sequitur nunc de statu Ecclesiae, qui describitur, et quidem primum hic sicut explicatum; dein qualis Ecclesiae 
hujus status fuerit; singuli versus, immo singula verba involvunt peculiarem statum ejus; et quia nunc de statu Ecclesiae agitur, repetitur quod mox prius, et quidem bis, nempe, 'et intrantes, masculus 
et femina de omni carne intrarunt,' cum in mox praecedent versu, ita, 'et intrarunt ad Noahum in arcam, bina et bina, de omni carne,' quae repetitio in Verbo significat, quod de alio statu agatur 
alioquin, ut quisque comprehendere potest, repetitio foret prorsus inanis. </p>
