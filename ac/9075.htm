<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9075节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9075.</strong>“牛主也必死”表对内在人的诅咒。这从“牛主”和“死”的含义清楚可知：“牛主”是指内在人（参看<a href="9069.htm">9069</a>节）；“死”是指诅咒，如前所述（<a href="9008.htm">9008</a>节）。如果牛主知道牛习惯用角抵伤人，然而却没有拴好它，就要用石头打死那牛，牛主也要死，其原因在于，这个判决或律法的属灵含义是这样：一个意识到自己里面的一个邪恶，却没有抑制住它的人是有罪的；因为他认可它，并因此熄灭了真理之光，随之扼杀了孕育中的对真理的信仰，或说就在对真理的信仰之种被植入的那一刻，他便粉碎了这种子。当对真理的信仰被扼杀时，来自主的良善就不被接受。因此，内在人无法被打开，因而无法被赋予属灵生命，也就是信之真理和良善的生命。当一个人的状态是这样时，他便过着一种属世生活，也就是外在人的生活。但若没有属灵生活，这种生活就是死的；其结果就是诅咒（参看<a href="7494.htm">7494</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9075</b></p><p><b>9075.</b>
And his master also shall die. That this signifies the damnation of the internal man, is evident from the signification of "the master of the ox," as being the internal man (see n. 9069); and from the 
signification of "dying," as being damnation (of which above, n. 9008). That the ox was to be stoned and his master was to die if he had known that the ox was wont to strike with the horn and he had 
not watched him, is because the spiritual meaning of this judgment or law is that the man who knows a thing to be evil, and does not repress it, is guilty; for he approves it, and thus extinguishes the 
light of truth, and together therewith the faith of truth in its conception; and when this is extinguished, good from the Lord is not received, consequently the internal man cannot be opened, and therefore 
there cannot be given him spiritual life, which is the life of the truth and the good of faith. When such is the state of a man, he then lives a natural life, which is of the external man. But 
without spiritual life this life is dead; consequently there is damnation (see n. 7494). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9075</b></p><p><b>9075.</b>
'And also its owner shall die' means damnation of the internal man. This is clear from the meaning of 'the owner of the ox' as the internal man, dealt with above in <a href="9069.htm">9069</a>; and from the meaning of 'dying' 
as damnation, also dealt with above, in <a href="9008.htm">9008</a>. The reason why an ox was to be stoned and its owner to die if he knew that the ox was accustomed to gore, yet did not keep it in, lies with the spiritual 
meaning of this judgement or law, which is this: A person who is aware of an evil in himself and does not restrain it is guilty; for he approves it and in so doing snuffs out the light of truth, and 
along with it he crushes the seed of a belief in the truth the moment it is implanted. And when this has been snuffed out good from the Lord is not received. As a result the internal man cannot be 
opened and consequently endowed with spiritual life, which is the life of the truth and good of faith. When this is a person's state he leads a natural life, which is that of the external man. But this 
life without spiritual life is dead, the result of which is damnation, <a href="7494.htm">7494</a>. </p>

</p><b>9075.</b>
`Et etiam dominus ejus morietur': quod significet damnationem interni hominis, constat ex significatione `domini bovis' quod sit internus homo, de qua supra n. 9069, et ex significatione `mori' quod 
sit damnatio, de qua etiam supra n. 9008.  Quod bos lapidaretur et dominus ejus {1} moreretur si notum ei fuerit {2} quod bos cornupeta fuerit, et non custodiverit eum, est quia spirituale hujus judicii 
seu legis est quod homo qui novit {3} quod malum sit, et non reprimit illud, reus sit, nam approbat illud et sic exstinguit lucem veri, et una {4} fidem veri in sua conceptione, qua exstincta bonum 
a Domino non recipitur; inde internus homo non potest aperiri, proinde non {5} donari vita spirituali, quae est vita veri et boni fidei; cum talis homini status est, tunc vitam naturalem, quae est externi 
hominis, vivit; sed haec vita absque vita spirituali est mortua, inde {6} damnatio, n. 7494. @1 bovis$ @2 fuerit domino$ @3 scit$ @4 sic$ @5 nec$ @6 et est$ </p>
