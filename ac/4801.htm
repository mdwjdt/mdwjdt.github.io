<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4801节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4801.</strong>有一个灵人同我说话，他活在世上时比其他人知道更多信之外层真理，但没有照信的戒律生活。因为他只爱自己，与自己相比鄙视其他人，以为在天堂，他必是最高层的人物之一。他因具有这种品质，故对天堂没有其它概念，只认为它如同世俗的国度。然而到了来世，他发现天堂和他原先想象的完全不同。事实上，当他得知，那些为首的，都不将自己置于他人之上，那些自认不配怜悯，因而按照他们的功德，他们是末后的之人尤其如此时，非常愤慨，便抛弃了肉身生活期间作为其信仰一部分的观念。他不断努力向那些属于舌头区域的人施暴，我蒙允许一连数周觉察他的努力，由此也得以知道那些对应于舌头之人的身份和性质，以及那些反对他们之人的身份。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4801</b></p><p><b>4801.</b>
A certain one conversed with me who at the time that he lived in the world had more than others known the exterior truths of faith, but still had not led a life in conformity with the precepts of faith; 
for he had loved himself only, and had despised others in comparison with himself, and had believed that he would be among the first in heaven; but because he was of such a quality he could not have 
any other opinion of heaven than as of a worldly kingdom. When in the other life he found that heaven was entirely different from what he had conceived it to be, and that those were chief who had not 
set themselves above others, especially those who had believed that they were unworthy of mercy, and thus that according to their merits they were the last, he was very indignant, and rejected the 
things that in the life of the body had been of his faith. He was continually endeavoring to do violence to those who were in the province of the tongue. It was granted me clearly to perceive his effort 
for several weeks, and hence also to know who and of what quality are those who correspond to the tongue, and who they are that are opposed to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4801</b></p><p><b>4801.</b>
Some spirit once spoke to me, whose knowledge of the exterior truths of faith, when he lived in the world, had been greater than others' knowledge of them. Yet for all that he had not led a life in keeping 
with the precepts of faith. He had loved only himself, despised others in comparison with himself, and believed that in heaven he would be one of those at the top. But being like this he had been 
unable to have any other conception of heaven than as a worldly kingdom In the next life however he learned that heaven was altogether different. Indeed when he learned that those at the top were not 
people who had set themselves above others, but were in particular people who had considered that they were unworthy of any mercy and so on merit ranked last, he was highly indignant and cast aside 
the ideas which during his lifetime had been part of his faith. He endeavoured constantly to do violence to those belonging to the province of the tongue, and I was allowed for several weeks to receive 
a sensation of his endeavour, from which I was also allowed to know the identity and nature of those who correspond to the tongue, and the identity of those opposed to them. </p>

</p><b>4801.</b>
(s)  Quidam mecum locutus est qui tempore cum vixit in mundo, exteriora vera fidei prae aliis sciverat, sed usque non vitam fidei praecepti conformem egerat; se enim solum amaverat, et alios prae 
se contempserat credideratque quod inter primos futurus in caelo; sed quia talis, non aliam opinionem de caelo habere potuerat quam sicut de regno mundano; is cum in altera vita comperit quod caelum 
prorsus aliud esset, et quod illi primarii essent qui se non praetulerant aliis, imprimis {1} qui se non dignos misericordia crediderant et sic ex merito ultimos esse, indignatus est valde, et illa 
qua fidei ejus fuerunt in vita corporis, rejecit; is continuo violentiam inferre illis conabatur, qui ex provincia linguae erant; conatum illius per plures septimanas etiam persentiscere dabatur, 
et inde quoque scire quinam et quales sunt qui linguae correspondent, et quinam qui eis oppositi sunt.(s) </p>
