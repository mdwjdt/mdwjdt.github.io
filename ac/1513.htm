<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1513节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1513.</strong>有一个灵人属于所谓不冷不热的那一种，他来到我面前，表现得好象最终悔悟过来。我没有察觉出这种欺骗性，尽管我能肯定他掩饰了某些东西。但灵人们说，他们无法忍受他的临在，他们的感觉就象即将呕吐之人通常所感受的那样。他们说，他就是那些必从口中被吐出来的人当中的一员。后来，他说了一些极其可憎的话，而且不肯停下来，无论如何劝说他。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1513.</strong> One of those who are called lukewarm{*1} came to me, acting as though he had repented. It did not feel like a trick, although I would have thought that he was hiding something inside. But the spirits were saying that they could not stand to have him near, that they were feeling the same sensation you feel when you are about to vomit, and that he was one of those who needed to be spat out.<br />Later, he started saying unspeakable things and was unable to stop, no matter how much pressure was put on him not to talk that way.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The "lukewarm" 钬?who are to be "spat out," as it says later in this section 钬?are referred to in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1513/bible_king-james-version_revelation_3_15-16" target=_top>Revelation 3:15-16</a>.

A certain spirit came to me of those called the lukewarm, who bore himself as if he had repented; nor did I perceive the deceit, although I thought that he was concealing something within. But the spirits 
said that they could not endure his presence, and that they felt within themselves such an effect as men feel when moved to vomit, and that he was among those who are to be spewed out. He afterwards 
spoke abominable things; nor could he desist, however much he was persuaded not to speak so. </p>

One of those who are called the lukewarm came to me behaving as though he had at last come to his senses. I did not sense deceit, though I did think that he was concealing something. But spirits said 
that they could not tolerate his presence, and that they felt as people usually do when about to vomit. They said that he was one of those who had to be spat out. After that he uttered things that are 
quite unrepeatable, and could not stop doing so, no matter how much he was being persuaded not to utter them. </p>

</p><b>1513.</b>
Quidam ex illis qui tepidi vocantur, ad me venit, se gerens tanquam resipuerit, nec sentiebam dolum, tametsi cogitarem quod intus reconderet sed spiritus dicebant quod non sufferre possent ejus praesentiam, 
et quod sentirent apud se quasi effectum qualem solent homines habere ad vomitum et quod inter tales esset qui exspuendi: is postea nefanda locutus nec desistere potuit, quomodocumque persuadebatur 
quod non ita loquendum. </p>
