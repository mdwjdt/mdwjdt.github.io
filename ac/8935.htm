<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8935节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8935.</strong>“你要为我筑土坛”表以一种总体的方式代表源于良善的敬拜的某种事物。这从“坛”和“土”的含义清楚可知：“坛”是指主，因而对祂的敬拜的首要代表（参看<a href="921.htm">921</a>，<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>，<a href="4489.htm">4489</a>，<a href="4541.htm">4541</a>节）；“土”是指良善。“土”之所以表示良善，是因为“土”表示住在良善中的教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>节）。这就是为何经上说亚当是“从土而出的”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.7.htm">2:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.19.htm">3:19</a>）；亚当表示属于属天教会的人，也就是住在良善中的教会本身（<a href="478.htm">478</a>，<a href="479.htm">479</a>节）。有两样事物激发对主的敬拜，即良善和真理。土坛代表源于良善的敬拜，而石坛则代表源于真理的敬拜。此处论述的主题就是这两种祭坛；激发敬拜的这两样事物被称为信和仁；源于真理的敬拜与信有关，源于良善的敬拜与仁有关。<br />至于信所激发的敬拜和仁所激发的敬拜，或说源于真理的敬拜和源于良善的敬拜，情况是这样：在一个人重生之前，他的敬拜由真理构成；但他重生之后，它就由良善构成。一个人在重生之前，通过真理被引向良善，也就是说，通过信被引向仁；但当他已经重生时，则住在良善中，并因此住在真理中，也就是住在仁中，并因此住在信中（<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8539.htm">8539</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>节）。这两种敬拜就是土坛和石坛所代表的。祭坛之所以是对主的敬拜的首要代表，是因为燔祭和祭物都是献在坛上的，而希伯来民族，因而以色列和犹太民族对神的敬拜主是由这些事物构成的（参看<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2805.htm">2805</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>节）。</p>

An altar of ground thou shalt make unto Me. That this signifies a representative of worship in general from good, is evident from the signification of "an altar," as being the principal representative 
of the Lord, and consequently of the worship of Him (see n. 921, 2777, 2811, 4489, 4541); and from the signification of "ground," as being good. That "ground" denotes good is because by "ground" is 
signified the church which is in good (n. 566). Hence Adam was said to be "from the ground" (Gen. 2:7; 3:19), for by him was signified the man of the celestial church, or the church which is in good (n. 
478, 479). There are two things from which the worship of the Lord is effected; good and truth. Worship from good was represented by an altar of ground, but worship from truth was represented by an 
altar of stones; both kinds of altars are here treated of. These two things from which worship is effected are called faith and charity; worship from truth bears relation to faith, and worship from good 
to charity. As regards worship from faith and worship from charity, or from truth and from good, the case is this. Before a man is regenerated he is in worship from truth, but when he has been regenerated, 
he is in worship from good. For before a man has been regenerated he is led by means of truth to good, that is, by means of faith to charity; but when he has been regenerated he is in good and 
thence in truth; that is, he is in charity and thence in faith (n. 8516, 8539, 8643, 8648, 8658). These two kinds of worship are what are represented by altars of ground and of stone. (That an altar 
is the chief representative of the worship of the Lord, because thereon were made burnt-offerings and sacrifices, and these were the things in which the Divine worship of the Hebrew nation, and thus 
of the Israelitish and Jewish nation, chiefly consisted, see n. 923, 1343, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519, 6905.) </p>

'An altar of soil you shall make for Me' means something which in a general way represents worship that springs from good This is clear from the meaning of 'an altar' as the chief representative of the 
Lord and consequently of the worship of Him, dealt with in <a href="921.htm">921</a>, <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="2811.htm">2811</a>, <a href="4489.htm">4489</a>, <a href="4541.htm">4541</a>; and from the meaning of 'soil' or 'the ground' as good. The reason why 'the ground' stands for good is that a 
Church which abides in good is meant by 'the ground', <a href="566.htm">566</a> This is why Adam was said to be formed from the ground, at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%202:7;%203:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 2:7; 3:19</a>; for one who belonged to the celestial Church, that is, the Church 
itself abiding in good, was meant by him, <a href="478.htm">478</a>, <a href="479.htm">479</a>. Since there are two entities that inspire worship of the Lord - goodness and truth - worship springing from good was represented by an altar of soil, 
while worship springing from truth was represented by an altar of stones. Both kinds of altars are the subject here; and those two entities that inspire worship are called faith and charity. Worship 
springing from truth has connection with faith, and worship springing from good has connection with charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards worship inspired by faith and worship inspired by charity, or that which 
springs from truth and that which springs from good, the situation is that before a person has been regenerated his worship consists of truth, but after he has been regenerated it consists of good. Before 
a person has been regenerated he is led by means of truth to good, that is, by means of faith to charity; but when he has been regenerated he abides in good and consequently in truth, that is, in 
charity and consequently in faith, <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8539.htm">8539</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>. These two kinds of worship are what the altars of soil and of stone represent. The reason why the altar is the chief representative of 
worship of the Lord is that burnt offerings and sacrifices were offered on it; and it was in these that the worship of God by the Hebrew nation, and subsequently by the Israelite and Jewish nation, 
chiefly consisted, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2805.htm">2805</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="6405.htm">6405</a>. </p>

`Altare humi facies Mihi': quod significet repraesentativum cultus in genere ex bono, constat ex significatione `altaris' quod sit principale repraesentativum Domini, et inde cultus Ipsius, de qua n. 
921, 2777, 2811, 4489, 4541, et ex significatione `humi' quod sit bonum; quod `humus' sit bonum, est quia per `humum' significatur Ecclesia quae in bono, n. 566, inde est quod Adam dictus sit ab humo, 
Gen. ii 7, iii 19, nam per illum significabatur homo Ecclesiae caelestis seu Ecclesia quae in bono, n. 478, 479.  Sunt duo ex quibus fit cultus Domini, bonum et verum; cultus ex bono repraesentabatur 
per `altare ex humo,' at cultus ex vero repraesentabatur per `altare ex lapidibus'; de utroque altari hic agitur; haec duo ex quibus fit cultus vocantur fides et charitas; cultus ex vero se refert 
ad fidem, et cultus ex bono ad charitatem. 	[2] Cum cultu ex fide et ex charitate, seu ex vero et ex bono, ita se habet: homo antequam regeneratus est, in cultu est ex vero, at cum regeneratus est, in 
cultu est ex bono, nam antequam homo regeneratus est, ducitur ille per verum {1} ad bonum, hoc est, per fidem ad charitatem sed cum regeneratus est, in bono est et inde in vero, hoc (o)est, in charitate 
est et inde in fide, n. 8516, 8539, (x)8643, 8648, 8658; hi bini cultus sunt qui repraesentantur per altaria ex humo et ex lapide.  Quod altare sit principale repraesentativum cultus Domini, est 
quia super illo fiebant holocausta et sacrificia; et haec erant in quibus principaliter consistebat cultus Divinus gentis Hebraeae, et inde gentis Israeliticae (c)ac Judaicae, n. 923, 1343, 2180, 2805, 
2807, (x)2830, 3519, 6905. @1 per verum ducitur$ </p>
