<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3394节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3394.</strong>“看哪，她实在是你的妻子，你怎么说她是我的妹子”表它若是神圣真理，那也就不是理性真理了。这从“妻子”和“妹子”的含义清楚可知：“妻子”，就是此处的利百加，是指主神圣理性的神圣真理（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）；“妹子”是指理性真理（<a href="3386.htm">3386</a>节），因此，“看哪，她实在是你的妻子，你怎么说她是我的妹子”表真理因是神性，故不可能是理性真理。<br />这个问题背后隐藏的奥秘是这样：属灵之人不像属天之人那样拥有直觉，故不知道人一旦重生，神性真理就变成他的理性真理。他们的确声称一切良善与一切真理都出自主，但当这些出现在他们的理性中时，他们仍以为这良善与真理是他们自己的，因而可以说源于他们自己。因为属灵之人无法摆脱自我（proprium），他们的自我就是如此意愿的。而属天之人的情况是这样：他们在理性，也就是在被主的神性启示后成为真理表象的理性事物中（<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节），甚至在属世部分，也就是感官和记忆知识的事物里面感知神圣良善与真理。由于属天之人处于这样一种状态，故他们能认识到一切良善与真理都从主流入，这是一种直觉何为良善与真理的能力，这种直觉能力从主那里传给他们，成为他们自己的，并构成他们的快乐、祝福和幸福。正因如此，上古之人，也就是属天之人，在他们用肉眼所看到的一切物体里面所感知到的，无非是属灵和属天的事物（<a href="1409.htm">1409</a>节）。<br />由于这奥秘与重生的属灵之人有关，他们通过被主重生而在一个新的意愿里面接受神圣良善，在一个新的理解力里面接受神圣真理，还由于如前所述，这种人只会认为真理若是理性的，就不可能是神性，因而认为真理若是神性，就与理性毫无瓜葛了，故此处才会说，真理若是神圣真理，也就不是理性真理了。这也是为何这种人渴望简单相信信的教义事物，而无需理性部分仔细审查的原因。殊不知，若没有某种理性概念，甚至属世概念的帮助，尽管他对这些概念的性质一无所知（<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>节），信的事物，哪怕其最深奥的秘密，就无法被任何人所理解。以这种方式它们能保护自己不受那些以否定心态推理每一件事的真相之人（<a href="2568.htm">2568</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）攻击。但对那些对于相信圣言持肯定心态的人来说，这种情况是有害的，因为它们有可能因此剥夺人的自由思考，将他的良知束缚在最高程度的异端中，结果，对此人内在与外在事物的掌控就以这种方式形成了。这一切，以及前面的内容就是亚比米勒对以撒说“看哪，她实在是你的妻子，你怎么说她是我的妹子”所表示的。</p>

Surely behold she is thy woman, and how saidst thou, She is my sister? That this signifies that if Divine truth it was not also rational, is evident from the signification of "woman," here Rebekah, as 
being the Divine truth of the Lord's Divine rational (n. 3012, 3013, 3077); and from the signification of "sister," as being rational truth (n. 3386); thus "behold she is thy woman, and how saidst thou, 
She is my sister?" signifies that because truth is Divine, it cannot be rational. [2] With this arcanum the case is this: The spiritual, not having perception as the celestial have, do not know 
that with a regenerated man Divine truth becomes rational truth. They do indeed say that all good and all truth are from the Lord; yet as these come forth in their rational, they suppose them to be their 
own, and thus as it were from themselves; for the spiritual cannot be separated from their own, and their own so wills it; although as regards this matter with the celestial, these perceive Divine 
good and truth in the rational, that is, in the rational things which when enlightened by the Divine of the Lord are appearances of truth (n. 3368), even in the natural, that is, in the things of sense 
and memory-knowledge; and as the celestial are in such a state, they are able to acknowledge that all good and truth flow in from the Lord; and also that there is a perceptive power of good and truth 
that is communicated and appropriated to them by the Lord, and that constitutes their delight, bliss, and happiness. It was from this that the most ancient people, who were celestial men, in all the 
objects which they saw with their eyes perceived nothing but celestial and spiritual things (n. 1409).  [3] Inasmuch as the regenerated spiritual man is here treated of, who through regeneration from 
the Lord has received Divine good in a new will, and Divine truth in a new understanding; and inasmuch as such persons are in no other perception than that, as before said, if truth were rational it 
could not be Divine, thus that if it were Divine it would have nothing in common with what is rational, therefore it is here said that if it was Divine truth it was not also rational. This likewise 
is the reason why such persons are desirous that the things of faith should be believed in simplicity, without any mental view of them on the part of the rational, not being aware that not anything of 
faith, not even its deepest secret, is comprehended by any man without some rational idea, and also a natural one, but of what quality he does not know (n. 3310). Hereby they may indeed protect themselves 
against those who reason about everything from what is negative as to whether it is so (n. 2568, 2588); but to those who are in the affirmative concerning the Word (namely, that it is to be believed) 
such a position is hurtful, as they may thus take away from anyone his freedom of thought, and even bind the conscience to that which is in the highest degree heretical by in this way dominating 
both the internal and the external things of a man. This and also the above is what is signified by Abimelech's saying to Isaac, "Behold she is thy woman, and how saidst thou, She is my sister?" </p>

'But behold, she is your wife! So how did you come to say, She is my sister?' means, if it was Divine Truth, then it was not also rational truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'Rebekah', to whom 
'wife' refers here, as the Divine Truth of the Lord's Divine Rational, dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, and from the meaning of 'a sister' as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="3386.htm">3386</a>, so that 'behold, she is 
your wife! So how did you come to say, She is my sister?' means that being Divine Truth, it cannot be rational truth. </p>

 The arcanum lying behind this matter is this: Spiritual people do not have 
perception as celestial people do, and therefore they do not know that Divine Truth becomes rational truth with a person once he has been regenerated. They do indeed assert that all good and all truth 
come from the Lord; but when these come to be present in their rational they still suppose that good and truth are their own and so originate so to speak in themselves. For they are unable to be separated 
from the proprium which desires this With celestial people however the situation is that they do perceive Divine Good and Truth within the rational, that is, within rational concepts which, when 
enlightened from the Lord's Divine, are appearances of truth, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, and also within the natural, that is, within facts and sensory impressions. And this being the state in which celestial people live 
they are able to recognize that all good and truth flow in from the Lord, and that it is an ability to perceive what is good and true, which is communicated to them from the Lord as their own and is 
the cause of their delight, blessedness, and happiness. It was for this reason that the most ancient people who were celestial perceived within the particular objects which they saw with the eyes nothing 
else than spiritual and celestial things, <a href="1409.htm">1409</a>. </p>
<p></p>

 Because this arcanum has to do with the regenerated spiritual person who through his regeneration by the Lord has received Divine Good within 
a new will and Divine Truth within a new understanding, and because that person perceives nothing other than this - that if the truth were rational it could not be Divine, as stated above, and so if 
it were Divine it would have nothing in common with rational - it is therefore stated here that if it was Divine Truth, then it was not also rational truth. This also is the reason why such people desire 
matters of faith to be believed in simplicity without any scrutiny by the rational. They are unaware of the fact that no matter of faith, not even the deepest arcanum of faith, can be grasped by 
anyone without the aid of some rational idea, or even a natural one, though he has no knowledge of the nature of those ideas, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a> (end). In this way they are able to protect themselves against those 
who from a negative attitude argue about the truth of every single thing, <a href="2568.htm">2568</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a>. But to those who have an affirmative attitude of belief in the Word the former is a harmful attitude to adopt, for 
it is one in which a person's freedom to think may be taken away and his conscience bound even to something extremely heretical, with the result that control is established over the person internally 
and externally. These are the considerations meant by Abimelech's saying to Isaac, 'Behold, she is your wife! So how did you come to say, She is my sister?' </p>

`Atqui ecce mulier tua illa, et quomodo dixisti, Soror mea illa?': quod significet si Divinum Verum non quoque rationale esset, constat ex significatione `mulieris,' hic Rebeccae, quod sit Divinum Verum 
Divini Rationalis Domini, de qua n. 3012, 3013, 3077; et ex significatione `sororis' quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 3386; ita, `ecce mulier tua illa et quomodo dixisti, Soror mea illa?' significat 
quia Divinum Verum est, quod non possit {1}rationale esse. [2] Cum hoc arcano (t)ita se habet: spirituales quia non perceptionem habent sicut caelestes, non sciunt quod Divinum Verum fiat rationale 
verum apud hominem cum regeneratus est; aiunt quidem quod omne bonum et omne verum a Domino, at usque cum illa existunt in rationali illorum, autumant usque quod bonum et verum sit illorum, ita quasi 
ab illis, non enim separari possunt a proprio, quod hoc vult; cum tamen id apud caelestes se ita habet quod percipiant Divinum Bonum et Verum in rationali, hoc est, in rationalibus quae, a Divino 
Domini illustrata, sunt apparentiae veri, n. 3368, etiam in naturali, hoc est, in scientificis ac sensualibus, et quia caelestes in tali statu sunt, agnoscere possunt {2}quod omne bonum et verum a Domino 
influat, ut et quod perceptivum boni et veri sit quod illis communicatur et appropriatur a Domino, ac facit illorum jucundum, beatum et felix; (m)inde erat quod antiquissimi qui caelestes homines 
fuerunt, in objectis singulis quae oculis videbant, non nisi quam caelestia et spiritualia {3}perceperint, n. 1409:(n) [3] quia hic de spirituali homine regenerato, qui Divinum Bonum in nova voluntate, 
(c)et Divinum Verum in novo intellectu, per regenerationem a Domino {4}accepit, et quia illi non in alia perceptione sunt quam si rationale esset, non posset esse Divinum, ut supra dictum, {5}ita si 
Divinum quod nihil commune haberet cum rationali, ideo hic dicitur, si Divinum Verum, non quoque rationale esset: (s)haec quoque causa est quod velint ut illa quae sunt fidei, simpliciter credantur 
absque aliqua intuitione a rationali, non scientes quod nusquam aliquid fidei, {6}ne quidem arcanissimum ejus, capiatur ab aliquo homine absque idea aliqua rationali, etiam naturali, sed quali, ille non 
novit, n. 3310 f.; per id quidem se tutari possunt adversus illos qui de omnibus et singulis ex negativo ratiocinantur num ita sit, n. 2568, 2588; at illis qui in affirmativo sunt de Verbo quod nempe 
credendum, est talis positio damnosa, sic enim possunt {7}cujusvis liberum cogitandi auferre, et conscientiam ligare etiam ad maxime haereticum, dominando sic super hominis interna et externa;(s) illa 
et haec sunt quae significantur per quod `Abimelechus dixit ad Jishakum, Ecce mulier tua illa, et quomodo dixisti, Soror mea illa?' @1 i verum$  @2 quod omnia et singula quae boni et veri sunt, 
a Domino influant, et sic Divina in se sint$  @3 perciperent$  @4 habet$  @5 et$  @6 etiam$  @7 cujusdem$  </p>
