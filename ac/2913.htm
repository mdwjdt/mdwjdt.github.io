<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2913节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2913.</strong>“向赫人讲话，说”表那些即将具有一个新的属灵教会之人。这从“赫”和“赫人”的含义清楚可知。迦南地有许多居民，他们在圣言各处被一一列举出来，其中就有赫人（参看创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.20.htm">15:20</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.8.htm">3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出13.5.htm">13:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.23.htm">23:23</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.1.htm">7:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.17.htm">20:17</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.10.htm">3:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书11.1.htm">11:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书11.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书12.8.htm">12:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.11.htm">24:11</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上9.20.htm">9:20</a>等等）。这些居民绝大部是来自古教会，古教会传遍很多地方，包括迦南地（参看<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）。凡属古教会的人都承认仁爱是首要事物，其所有教义都关乎仁爱或生活。那些钻研信之教义的人被称为“迦南人”，并与迦南地的其他居民分开（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.29.htm">13:29</a>；参看<w1>1062<w2>1062<w3>-<w1>1063<w2>1063<w3>，<w1>1076<w2>1076<w3>节）。<br />在迦南地的这些居民中，赫人算是比较好的。这从以下事实明显看出来：亚伯拉罕就住在他们中间，后来以撒和雅各也是，并且在那里还有他们的埋葬地；而且他们对待亚伯拉罕极为敬重和谦逊，这从本章有关他们的记载很明显地看出来（尤其5-6，10-11，14-15等节）。由于赫人是正直的民族，故他们代表并表示这个属灵教会或该教会的真理。但是，和古教会的其他人一样，随着时间推移，他们开始从仁爱或信之良善堕落；这解释了为何后来他们也表示教会的虚假（如以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.3.htm">16:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.45.htm">45</a>等）。然而，赫人仍算得上是更可敬的。这从以下事实明显看出来，有赫人与大卫在一起，如亚比米勒（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上26.6.htm">26:6</a>），乌利亚就是一个赫人（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下11.3.htm">11:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下11.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下11.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下11.21.htm">21</a>），他的妻子就是给大卫生所罗门的拔示巴（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下12.24.htm">12:24</a>）。“赫”表关于生活的外在认知，也就是构成属灵教会的外在真理（参看<a href="1203.htm">1203</a>节）。<br />本节论述的是前教会气绝后主所建立的新教会；接下来的几节论述的是这些人对信的接受。所论述的主题并非赫人当中的某个具体教会，而是在前任衰退并终结后，主总体上重新建立的属灵教会。赫人只不过是那些代表并表示这种属灵含义的人。关于这些教会，请参看前面所述，即：随着时间推移，一个教会逐渐衰退并终结（<a href="494.htm">494</a>，<a href="501.htm">501</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="2422.htm">2422</a>节）。它逐渐远离仁爱，并制造邪恶与虚假（<a href="1834.htm">1834</a>，<a href="1835.htm">1835</a>节）；那时，可以说教会被荒废，并变得荒凉（<a href="407.htm">407</a>-<a href="411.htm">411</a>，<a href="2243.htm">2243</a>节）。一个教会在外邦人当中重新建立；以及为何在外邦人中建立的原因（<a href="1366.htm">1366</a>节）。在正经历荒废的教会中，总有作为一个核心的某种教会之物得以保存下来（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2422.htm">2422</a>节）。若世上没有一个教会，人类必要灭亡（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2422.htm">2422</a>节）。教会在大身体，就是人类中如同心与肺（<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2054.htm">2054</a>，<a href="2853.htm">2853</a>节）。属灵教会的性质（<a href="765.htm">765</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>节）。构成该教会的是仁，而非与仁分离之信（<a href="809.htm">809</a>，<a href="916.htm">916</a>节）。如果所有人都拥有仁爱，那么这个教会必为一，尽管他们的教义和敬拜形式有所不同（<a href="1285.htm">1285</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="1799.htm">1799</a>，<a href="1834.htm">1834</a>，<a href="1844.htm">1844</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）。在世上，在主教会中的所有人尽管分散在世界各地，但可以说仍构成一个整体，如在天上那样（<a href="2853.htm">2853</a>节）。每个教会都有内在与外在之分，这二者一起构成一个教会（<a href="409.htm">409</a>，<a href="1083.htm">1083</a>，<a href="1098.htm">1098</a>，<a href="1100.htm">1100</a>，<a href="1242.htm">1242</a>节）。若没有一个内在教会，外在教会什么也不是（<a href="1795.htm">1795</a>节）。教会好比日升日落，还好比一年四季、一日四时（<a href="1837.htm">1837</a>节）。最后审判就是教会的末期（<a href="900.htm">900</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>节）。</p>

And spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying. That this signifies those with whom there was to be a new spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "Heth," and of the "Hittites." There were many 
inhabitants of the land of Canaan, who are enumerated in various places in the Word, and among them the Hittites (see Gen. 15:20; Exod. 3:8, 17; 13:5; 23:23; Deut. 7:1; 20:17; Josh. 3:10; 11:1, 3; 12:8; 
24:11; 1 Kings 9:20; and other places). Most of these were from the Ancient Church (that this extended through many lands, and likewise through the land of Canaan, may be seen above, n. 1238, 2385). 
All who were of that church acknowledged charity as the principal, and all their doctrinal things were of charity or of life. Those who elaborated doctrinal things of faith were called "Canaanites," 
and were separated from the other inhabitants of the land of Canaan (Num. 13:29; see n. 1062-1063, 1076). [2] Among the better inhabitants of the land of Canaan were the Hittites, as is evident from 
the fact that Abraham dwelt among them, and afterwards Isaac and Jacob, and had their burial place there; also from their bearing themselves piously and modestly toward Abraham, as is very plain from 
what is related of them in this chapter (particularly in verses 5-6, 10-11, 14-15). And thus by the Hittites, as by a well-disposed nation, is represented and signified the spiritual church, or the 
truth of the church. But with these, as with the rest of the Ancient church, it came to pass that in course of time they declined from charity or the good of faith; and consequently the falsity of the 
church is afterwards signified by them (as in Ezek. 16:3, 45, and other places). That still the Hittites were among the more honored, is evident from the fact that there were Hittites with David, as 
Abimelech (1 Sam. 26:6), and Uriah, who was a Hittite (2 Sam. 11:3, 6, 17, 21), whose wife was Bathsheba, of whom Solomon was born to David (2 Sam. 12:24). (That "Heth" signifies the more external knowledges 
regarding life, which are the external truths of the spiritual church, may be seen above, n. 1203.) [3] This verse treats of the new church that the Lord sets up anew when the former church 
expires; and the verses that follow treat of the reception of faith with them. A church among the sons of Heth is not treated of; but the raising up by the Lord of the spiritual church in general, after 
the former ceases or is consummated; the sons of Heth are merely those who represent and signify this. See what has been said above concerning churches, namely: That in process of time a church decreases 
and is contaminated (n. 494, 501, 1327, 2422): That it recedes from charity, and produces evils and falsities (n. 1834, 1835): That then the church is said to be laid waste and desolate (n. 407-411, 
2243): That a church is set up anew with the Gentiles, and why (n. 1366). That in the church which is being vastated, there is always preserved something of the church as a nucleus (n. 468, 637, 
931, 2422): That unless there were a church on earth, the human race would perish (n. 468, 637, 931, 2422): That the church is as the heart and lungs in the grand body, that is, in the human race (n. 
637, 931, 2054, 2853): The quality of the spiritual church (n. 765, 2669): That charity constitutes the church, not faith separate (n. 809, 916): That if all had charity, the church would be one, although 
they should differ as to doctrinal things and worship (n. 1285, 1316, 1798, 1799, 1834, 1844, 2385): That all men on earth who are in the Lord's church, though scattered through the world, still 
as it were make a one, as in the heavens (n. 2853): That every church is internal and external, and both together constitute one church (n. 409, 1083, 1098, 1100, 1242): That the external church is nothing, 
if there is no internal church (n. 1795): That the church is compared to the rising and the setting of the sun, also to the seasons of the year, and the times of the day (n. 1837): That the Last 
Judgment is the last time of the church (n. 900, 931, 1850, 2117, 2118). </p>

'And spoke to the sons of Heth, saying' means those with whom a new spiritual Church was to exist. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'Heth' and of Hittite. Many were the nations inhabiting the land 
of Canaan who are mentioned one by one in various places in the Word, among them the Hittites, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:20</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:8,%2017;%2013:5;%2023:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:8, 17; 13:5; 23:23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:1;%2020:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:1; 20:17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:10;%2011:1,%203;%2012:8;%2024:11;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3:10; 11:1, 3; 12:8; 24:11; 1</a> Kings 9:20; and elsewhere. Most of them belonged to the Ancient Church which was spread through many lands, including the land of Canaan, see <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>. All who belonged to that Church acknowledged charity 
as the chief thing, and everything they taught was about charity or life. People who cultivated teachings about faith were called Canaanites and were separate from the rest of the inhabitants in the 
land of Canaan, Num. 13:29 - see <a href="1062.htm">1062</a>, <a href="1063.htm">1063</a>, <a href="1076.htm">1076</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Hittites belonged among those in the land of Canaan who were more acceptable. This is also made clear by the fact that Abraham, and subsequently 
Isaac and Jacob, dwelt among them and had a burial-place there, and also by the fact that they treated Abraham with greatest respect, as is quite clear from what is recorded about them in this 
chapter, especially verses 5, 6,10, 11, 14, 15. Since they were an upright nation they therefore represent and mean the spiritual Church, or the truth of the Church. But it happened that like all the 
others who belonged to the Ancient Church the Hittites fell away in the course of time from charity or good that goes with faith; and this explains why later on they mean the falsity of the Church, 
as in Ezek. 16:3, <a href="45.htm">45</a>, and elsewhere. Yet the Hittites did belong among those who were more honourable, as may be seen from the fact that David had Hittites with him, such as Ahimelech, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam. 26:6, and 
Uriah, who was a Hittite, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 11:3, <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a> - by whose wife Bathsheba David begot Solomon, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 12:24. 'Heth' means exterior cognitions that have regard to life and which constitute the external 
truths of the spiritual Church,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> see <a href="1203.htm">1203</a>. </p>

 The subject in the present verse is a new Church which the Lord establishes when the previous one breathes its last, and in the verses which follow 
the subject is the reception of faith among those people. The subject is not some particular Church among the sons of Heth but in general the re-establishment by the Lord of a spiritual Church after 
its predecessor fades away and approaches its end. The sons of Heth are simply those who represent and carry a spiritual meaning. Please see what has been stated already about Churches in the following 
places: </p>

`Et locutus est ad filios Heth, dicendo':  quod significet illos apud quos nova Ecclesia spiritualis, constare potest a significatione Heth et Hittaei.  Plures fuerunt incolae terrae Canaanis qui passim 
enumerantur in Verbo, et inter eos Hittaei, videatur Gen. xv 20; Exod. iii 8, 17; xiii 5; xxiii 23; Deut. vii I; xx 17; Jos. iii 10; xi 1, 3; xii 8; xxiv 11; I Reg. ix 20; et alibi; fuerunt plerique 
illorum ex Antiqua Ecclesia, quae quod per plures terras extensa fuerit et quoque per terram Canaanem, videatur n. 1238, 2385:  omnes qui ab illa Ecclesia fuerunt, pro principali agnoverunt charitatem; 
et doctrinalia eorum omnia fuerunt charitatis seu vitae; qui doctrinalia fidei excoluerunt, dicti sunt Canaanitae, et separati e ceteris incolis terrae Canaanis, Num. xiii 29, videatur n. 1062, 
1063, 1076; [2] inter meliores in terra Canaane fuerunt Hittaei, quod etiam inde constare potest quod Abraham inter eos habitaret, et postea Jishak et Jacob, et quod sepultura ibi illis, tum quod pie 
et modeste erga Abrahamum se gererent, ut manifeste patet ab illis quae in hoc capite de iis memorantur, imprimis vers. 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15; inde est quod {1}per illos ut per gentem probam, repraesentetur

per illos dein significetur Ecclesiae falsum, ut Ezech. xvi 3, 45, et alibi; quod usque Hittaei inter honoratiores essent, constare potest ex eo quod Hittaei essent apud Davidem, ut Ahimelech, I Sam.
