Verses 2-7. I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants. Thou shalt have no other gods before My faces. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven 
image, nor any likeness of that which is in the heavens above, or that which is in the earth beneath, or that which is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve 
them; for I Jehovah thy God am a zealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the thirds and upon the fourths of them that hate Me; and doing mercy to thousands of them that 
love Me and keep My commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  "I am Jehovah thy God," signifies the 
Lord as to the Divine Human universally reigning in each and all things of good and truth; "who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants," signifies liberation by Him 
from hell; "Thou shalt have no other gods before My faces," signifies that truths must not be thought of from any other source than the Lord; "Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image," signifies 
not from self-intelligence; "nor any likeness," signifies a semblance of those things which are from the Divine; "of that which is in the heavens above, or that which is in the earth beneath," signifies 
of those things which are in spiritual light, or of those which are in natural light; "or that which is in the waters under the earth," signifies of those which are in the sensuous corporeal; "thou 
shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them," signifies no Divine worship is to be paid them; "for I Jehovah thy God," signifies the Divine from the Lord in each and all things; "am a zealous 
God," signifies that falsity and evil are therefrom; "visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons," signifies the consequent prolification of falsity derived from evil; "upon the thirds and upon 
the fourths," signifies in a long series, and the conjunction of them; "of them that hate Me," signifies who absolutely reject the Divine of the Lord; "and doing mercy unto thousands," signifies good 
and truth unto them forever; "of them that love Me," signifies who receive the good of love; "and keep My commandments," signifies who receive the truths of faith; "Thou shalt not take the name of 
Jehovah thy God in vain," signifies profanings and blasphemings of the truth and good of faith; "for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain," signifies that these things cannot 
be forgiven. </p>

Verses 2-7 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. You shall not have other gods before My face. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or 
any likeness [of things] which are in the heavens above, and which are on the earth beneath, and which are in the waters under the earth. You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them; 
for I am Jehovah your God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> on the third and on the fourth [generations] of those who hate Me, and showing mercy to thousands who love 
Me and keep My commandments. You shall not take the name of [Jehovah] your God in vain; for Jehovah will not render him innocent who takes His name in vain. </p>
<p>'I am Jehovah your God' means the Lord 
in respect of the Divine Human reigning universally, in every single aspect of goodness and truth. 'Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves' means deliverance by Him from 
hell. 'You shall not have other gods before My face' means that there must be no thought about truths from any source other than the Lord. 'You shall not make for yourself a graven image' means no product 
of self-intelligence. 'Or any likeness' means a resemblance of those things which are from God. 'Which are in the heavens above, and which are on the earth beneath' means which exist in spiritual 
light, and which exist in natural light. 'And which are in the waters under the earth' means which exist on the level of the bodily senses. 'You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them' 
means that no Divine worship must be offered to them. 'For I am Jehovah your God' means that the Divine from the Lord is in every single thing. 'A jealous God' means that as a result there is falsity 
and evil. 'Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons' means the consequent propagation of falsity from evil. 'On the third and on the fourth [generations]' means in a long sequence, and joined 
together. 'Of those who hate Me' means those who completely reject the Lord's Divinity. 'And showing mercy to thousands' means goodness and truth imparted to them for evermore. 'Who love Me' means 
who receive the good of love. 'And keep My commandments' means who receive the truths of faith. 'You shall not take the name of your God in vain' means instances in which the truth or the good of faith 
is profaned or blasphemed 'For Jehovah will not render him innocent who takes His name in vain' means that these things cannot be forgiven.

Vers. 2-7.  Ego Jehovah Deus tuus, Qui eduxi te e terra Aegypti, e domo servorum.  Non erit tibi dii alii coram faciebus Meis. Non facies tibi sculptile, et ullam similitudinem quae in caelis desuper, 
et quae in terra desubter, et quae in aquis de sub terra.  Non incurvabis te illis, et non servies illis, quia Ego Jehovah Deus tuus, Deus zelotes, visitans iniquitatem patrum super filios, super tertios 
et super quartos, osoribus Meis.  Et faciens misericordiam ad millenos amantibus Me, et custodientibus praecepta Mea.  Non feres nomen [Jehovae] Dei tui ad vanum, quia non innocentem reddet Jehovah 
illum qui fert nomen Ipsius ad vanum.  `Ego Jehovah Deus tuus significat Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum universaliter regnans in omnibus et singulis boni (c)et veri: `Qui eduxi te e terra Aegypti,
