<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8407节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8407.</strong>“巴不得我们在埃及地早死在耶和华的手下”表对他们来说，他们处于侵扰的状态时被主抛弃反而更好一些。这从“巴不得”、“早死在耶和华的手下”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知。“巴不得”是指更好一些，或更可取。“早死在耶和华的手下”是指早被主抛弃，因为“早死”在灵义上表示沉浸在邪恶和由它们所产生的虚假之中，因而沉浸在诅咒之中（<a href="5407.htm">5407</a>，<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>，<a href="7494.htm">7494</a>节）；“早死在耶和华的手下”这句话之所以表示被主抛弃，是因为那些被祂抛弃，也就是抛弃祂的人一头扎进邪恶和由此它们所生的虚假之中，因而扎进诅咒之中；“耶和华”在圣言中是指主，如前面频繁所示。“埃及地”是指侵扰的状态（参看<a href="8401.htm">8401</a>节）。以色列人所代表的那些属于属灵教会的人在被主释放之前，被法老和埃及人所代表的那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人侵扰（参看<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7474.htm">7474</a>，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>，<a href="8018.htm">8018</a>，<a href="8099.htm">8099</a>，<a href="8159.htm">8159</a>，<a href="8321.htm">8321</a>节）。</p>

Oh that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt. That this signifies that it would have been better for them to have been left by the Lord when they were in a state of infestations, is 
evident from the signification of "oh that," as being that it would have been better, or would have been preferable; from the signification of "to have died by the hand of Jehovah," as being for them 
to have been left by the Lord (in the spiritual sense "to have died" signifies to be in evils and the derivative falsities, consequently to be in damnation, see n. 5407, 6119, 7494; and when it is said 
"to have died by the hand of Jehovah," it denotes to be left by the Lord, for they who are left by Him, that is, who leave Him, rush into evils and the derivative falsities, and thus into damnation; 
that "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord has often been shown above); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being a state of infestations (see above, n. 8401). (That those who were 
of the spiritual church, who are represented by the sons of Israel, before they were liberated by the Lord, were infested by those who were in falsities from evil, who are represented by Pharaoh and 
the Egyptians, see n. 6854, 6914, 7474, 7828, 7932, 8018, 8099, 8159, 8321.) </p>

'Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt' means that it would have been preferable for them to have been forsaken by the Lord when they were in the state involving molestations. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'would that!' as it would have been better or preferable; from the meaning of 'to have died by the hand of Jehovah' as to have been forsaken by the Lord, for 'to 
have died' in the spiritual sense means to be immersed in evils and the falsities arising from them, and therefore in damnation, <a href="5407.htm">5407</a>, <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, <a href="7494.htm">7494</a>, and the expression 'dying by the hand of Jehovah' means 
being forsaken by the Lord, because those who are forsaken by Him, that is, who forsake Him, plunge into evils and falsities arising from them, and so into damnation (it has been shown many times 
before that 'Jehovah' in the Word is the Lord); and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the state involving molestations, dealt with above in <a href="8401.htm">8401</a>. For what had been happening to those belonging 
to the spiritual Church, who are represented by 'the children of Israel', before they were delivered by the Lord - that they had been molested by those steeped in falsities arising from evil, who are 
represented by 'Pharaoh' and 'the Egyptians' - see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7474.htm">7474</a>, <a href="7828.htm">7828</a>, <a href="7932.htm">7932</a>, <a href="8018.htm">8018</a>, <a href="8099.htm">8099</a>, <a href="8159.htm">8159</a>, <a href="8321.htm">8321</a>. </p>

`Quis dabit? mortui fuissemus manu Jehovae in terra Aegypti': quod significet quod praestiterit relictos fuisse a Domino cum erant in statu infestationum, constat ex significatione `quis dabit?' quod 
sit melius fuisse seu praestitisse; ex significatione `mortui esse manu Jehovae' quod sit ut relicti a Domino; per {1}`mortuum esse' in sensu spirituali significatur {2} in malis et inde falsis esse, 
proinde in damnatione, n. 5407, 6119, 7494; et cum dicitur `mori manu Jehovae,' est relinqui a Domino, nam qui relinquuntur ab Ipso, hoc est, qui relinquunt Ipsum, in mala et inde falsa ruunt, et sic 
in damnationem; quod `Jehovah' in Verbo sit Dominus, pluries prius ostensum est et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit status infestationum, de qua supra n. 8401; quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, 
qui repraesentantur per `filios Israelis,' priusquam liberati sunt a Domino, infestati fuerint ab illis qui in falsis ex malo, qui repraesentantur per `Pharaonem' et `Aegyptios,' videatur n.
