<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1831节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1831.</strong>“一半对着另一半摆列”表属天事物的平行和对应。这从以下事实清楚可知：一半表教会，另一半表主。当这两部分对着摆列时，这无非是一种平行和对应。由于表属天事物的母牛犊、母山羊、公绵羊（如9节所述）被劈成两半，并对着摆列，故显然，属天之物有一个平行和对应。然而，稍后论述的属灵之物则不然。如所常说的，属天之物全都是那些属于爱主爱邻之物，赋予爱和仁的，是主，而接受者是教会，去联结的则是良知，爱和仁就被植入在这良知中。所以，这两部分之间的空隙表示人里面那些被称为直觉、内在指示和良知之物。直觉、指示和良知之上的事物是主的，而之下的事物则在人里面。由于在上之物和在下之物由此彼此注视，故有“平行”一说；并且由于它们如同主动物与被动物那样彼此对应，故有“对应”一说。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1831.</strong> And set each of the parts across from its other [half] symbolizes parallelism and correspondence regarding heavenly things. The evidence for this is that the pieces on one side symbolize the church, while those on the other side symbolize the Lord, and when they are placed opposite each other there is nothing but symmetry and correspondence. It was the heifer, goat, and ram that were split and set like this, and they symbolize heavenly attributes, as noted just above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1831/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_9" target=_top>9</a>, so it is clear that there is symmetry and correspondence in respect to heavenly attributes. The case is different with spiritual attributes, however, and they will be discussed just below.<br />As I have frequently mentioned,{*1} heavenly attributes are all those that have to do with love for the Lord and love for our neighbor. The Lord is the one who bestows love and a sense of charity; the church is the one that accepts them. What unites the two is conscience, the soil in which love and charity are planted. So the space between the pieces symbolizes the capacity in us that is called perception, an inner voice, or conscience. Anything higher than perception, the inner voice, and conscience is the Lord's; anything below them is part of us. Since each side looks to the other, then, they are described as parallel; and since they answer or respond to one another as active and passive do, they are said to correspond.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages identifying heavenliness with love for the Lord and for one's neighbor, see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1831/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_353" target=_top>353</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1831/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1831/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1096#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1096:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1831/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824" target=_top>1824</a>.

And laid each part over against the other. That this signifies a parallelism and correspondence as to the celestial things, may be seen from the consideration that the parts on one side signify the church, 
and the parts on the other the Lord; and when these are placed opposite to each other, this is nothing else than a parallelism and correspondence; and as the heifer, the she-goat, and the ram were 
so divided and placed, and by these celestial things are signified (as said just above at verse 9), it is evident that there is a parallelism and correspondence as to celestial things. It is otherwise 
with spiritual things, concerning which presently. Celestial things, as has often been said, are all that pertain to love to the Lord and to love toward the neighbor. It is the Lord who gives love 
and charity; it is the church that receives. What unites is conscience, in which the love and charity are implanted; and therefore the middle space between the parts signifies that in man which is called 
perception, internal dictate, and conscience. The things which are above the perception, dictate, and conscience, are the Lord's; those which are below, are in man. Because they thereby mutually 
regard each other, there is said to be a parallelism; and because they correspond to each other, as the active and the passive, there is said to be correspondence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1831</b></p><p><b>1831.</b>
'And he laid each part opposite the other' means a parallelism and correspondence as regards celestial things. This becomes clear from the fact that the parts on one side mean the Church and those on 
the other the Lord. And when these are set in their proper places opposite each other, nothing else is meant than parallelism and correspondence. And because the heifer, the she-goat, and the ram, which 
mean celestial things, as stated just above at verse 9, were cut in half as described and laid in their proper places, it is clear that there is a parallelism and correspondence as regards celestial 
things. As regards spiritual things however, which will be dealt with shortly, the situation is different. As often stated, celestial things are all those that have to do with love to the Lord and 
love towards the neighbour. It is the Lord who imparts love and charity, the Church that receives; and that which unites is conscience, which has love and charity implanted within it. Consequently the 
space in between the parts means those things present in man which are called perception, internal dictate, and conscience. The things that exist above that perception, dictate, and conscience are the 
Lord's, those that are below reside in man. Thus because these things above and those below look towards one another, a parallelism is said to exist; and because they correspond to one another, as active 
and passive, a correspondence is said to exist. </p>

'Et dedit quamvis partem suam obviam alteri': quod significet parallelismum et correspondentiam quoad caelestia, constare potest ex eo quod partes ab una parte significent Ecclesiam, partes ab altera 
Dominum, quae cum ponuntur sibi mutuo e regione, non aliud est quam parallelismus et correspondentia; et quia vitula, capra et aries ita divisa sunt et posita, per quae significantur caelestia, ut mox 
supra ad vers. 9 dictum, constat quod parallelismus et correspondentia sit quoad caelestia; aliter vero quoad spiritualia, de quibus mox: caelestia sunt, ut saepe dictum, omnia quae sunt amoris in 
Dominum et amoris erga proximum; Dominus est Qui dat amorem et charitatem, Ecclesia est quae recipit; quod unit est conscientia, cui implantatur amor et charitas; quare spatium medium inter partes significat 
illud apud hominem quod appellatur perceptio, dictamen internum, et conscientia; quae supra perceptionem, dictamen et conscientiam, sunt Domini, quae infra, sunt apud hominem; ita quia se mutuo 
spectant, dicitur parallelismus, et quia sibi mutuo correspondent, ut activum et passivum, dicitur correspondentia. </p>
