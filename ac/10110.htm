<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10110</strong>.“好充满手”表为接受神性真理。这从“充满手”的含义清楚可知，“充满手”是指代表天堂里的神性真理方面的主，以及那里对这真理的传给和接受（参看<a href="10076.htm">10076</a>节）。这句话，即他们“吃含有赎罪之物的圣物，好充满手”表示那些已经从邪恶和由此而来的虚假中洁净的人，为接受神性真理而将良善变成他们自己的，其含义如下。<br />变成一个人自己的一切当中，第一个事物就是良善，真理分阶段随后到来。原因在于，良善是土壤，真理是种子。良善正是以同样的方式接纳真理并与它结合，因为它就像父母一样热爱真理。事实上，天上的婚姻关系存在于良善与真理之间，构成一个人生命的，是良善，因为良善属于意愿，人的意愿才是实际的这个人自己。而真理并不构成人的生命，除非它源于良善。因为真理属于理解力，没有意愿的理解力并不是实际的这个人自己，它只是进入这个人的一个入口或门口；事实上，理解力是事物进入意愿所经由的入口或门口。<br />人好比一座拥有许多房间，并且一个房间通向另一个房间的房子。那些唯独在理解力中拥有真理的人不在这座房子的任何一个房间中，仅仅在外面的院子中。然而，真理通过理解力进入意愿到何等程度，此人就进入房间，并住在房子里到何等程度。此外，在圣言中，人也被比作一座房子，只限于理解力的真理被比作院子。但是，也已成为意愿的一部分，并在那里变成良善的真理则被比作被居住的房间和实际的卧室或内室。<br />良善是来自主并变成一个人自己的一切当中的第一个事物，这一点从人的幼儿和童年早期明显看出来。众所周知，这时他拥有纯真的良善、对父母和保姆之爱的良善，以及对同龄伙伴之仁的良善。这良善从主流入小孩子，好叫它能在接下来的阶段作为第一个要求而为主的生命与一个人的同在服务，因而作为一个基础层面而为接受真理而服务。这良善也会随着此人长大而被保存，只要他自己没有通过邪恶的生活和由此而来的虚假信仰而毁灭它。当我们说到良善时，意思是说对邻之仁和对主之爱；因为系爱与仁之显现的一切都是良善。对那些正在重生的人来说，良善占据第一位，真理占据第二位，尽管表面上不是这样（参看<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>，<a href="4926.htm">4926</a>，<a href="4928.htm">4928</a>，<a href="4930.htm">4930</a>，<a href="6256.htm">6256</a>，<a href="6269.htm">6269</a>，<a href="6272.htm">6272</a>，<a href="6273.htm">6273</a>节）。</p>

To fill their hand. That this signifies to receive Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "filling the hand," as being to represent the Lord as to Divine truth, and its capability of communication 
and reception there (see n. 10076). It is said that they should "eat the holy things in which expiation was made, to fill their hand," and by these things is signified the appropriation of good 
with those who are purified from evils and the derivative falsities, thus to receive Divine truth.  [2] The case herein is this. The first of all that is appropriated to man is good, and successively 
truth. The reason is that good is the ground, and truth is the seed; just so in like manner does good adopt truth and conjoin it with itself, because it loves it like a parent. For there is a heavenly 
conjugial relation between good and truth; and good is that which makes the life with man, because good is of the will, and the will of man is the man himself; whereas truth does not make the life 
with man except insofar as it partakes of good, because truth is of the understanding, and the understanding without the will is not the man himself, but only an entrance to the man, for entrance is 
made through the understanding. [3] Man may be compared to a house in which are a number of rooms, one of which leads into another. They who are in truths as to the understanding only, are not in any 
room of the house, but only in the court; but insofar as through the understanding truth enters into the will, so far the man enters into the rooms and dwells in the house. Moreover, in the Word man 
is compared to a house, and the truth which is of the understanding alone is compared to a court; but the truth which has been made also of the will, and has there become good, is compared to an inhabited 
room and to the very bedchamber. [4] That good is that which is first of all appropriated to man from the Lord is evident from his infancy and early childhood; when, as is well known, he has the 
good of innocence and the good of love toward his parents and toward his nurse, and the good of charity toward his infant companions. This good flows in from the Lord with infants so that it may serve 
in advancing age for the first of the Lord's life with man, and thus for a plane to receive truths. This good is also preserved with a man when he grows up, if he does not destroy it by a life of 
evil and a faith of falsity thence derived. When we speak of good, charity toward the neighbor is meant, and love to the Lord, for all that which is of love and charity is good. (That with those who are 
being regenerated good is in the first place and truth in the second, although it appears otherwise, see n. 3325, 3494, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 6256, 6269, 6272, 6273.) </p>

'To fill their hand' means in order to receive Divine Truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'filling the hand' as representing the Lord in respect of Divine Truth in the heavens, and the transmission 
and the reception of that Truth there, dealt with in <a href="10076.htm">10076</a>. The implications of this statement - that 'they shall eat the holy things containing what has been expiated, to fill their hand' means the 
making of good their own by those who have been purified from evils and consequent falsities in order to receive Divine Truth - </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 are as follows: The first thing of all to be made a person's own 
is good, followed in stages by truth. The reason why this should be so is that good is the ground and truth the seed. So in a similar way good adopts truth and joins it to itself, because it loves truth 
like a parent. For a heavenly conjugial relationship exists between good and truth, and good is what constitutes a person's life, since good belongs to the will and a person's will is the actual person. 
But truth does not constitute a person's life except insofar as it originates in good. Because truth belongs to the understanding, and the understanding without the will is not the actual person, 
it is merely the doorway to the person; for the understanding is the doorway through which things pass into the will.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 A person may be compared to a house with a large number of rooms leading 
one into the next. People who have truths solely in their understanding are not in any room in the house but merely in the court outside. So far however as truth passes through the understanding into 
the will it passes into the rooms and lives in the house. A person is also compared in the Word to a house, and truth confined to the understanding is compared to the court. But truth which has also 
been made part of the will and becomes good there is compared to a room that is lived in and to the actual bedchamber.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that good is the first thing of all to come from the Lord and be 
made a person's own is clear from his infancy and early childhood. At this time, as is well known, the good of innocence, the good of love towards parents and nursemaid, and the good of charity towards 
companions of his own age exist with him. This good flows from the Lord into young children to serve in the next stage of life as the first requirement for the presence of the Lord's life with a person, 
and so to serve as the groundwork for receiving truths. That good with the person is also preserved as he grows up, unless he himself destroys it by a life of evil and consequent belief in what 
is false. When the word 'good' is used charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord should be understood; for everything that is a manifestation of love and charity is good.  </p>
<p>Good occupies the 
first place and truth the second with those who are being regenerated, though the appearance is other than this, see <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="3494.htm">3494</a>, <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, <a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>, <a href="4926.htm">4926</a>, <a href="4928.htm">4928</a>, <a href="4930.htm">4930</a>, <a href="6256.htm">6256</a>, <a href="6269.htm">6269</a>, <a href="6272.htm">6272</a>, <a href="6273.htm">6273</a>.  </p>

`Ad implendum manum eorum': quod significet ad recipiendum Divinum Verum, constat ex significatione `implere manum' quod sit repraesentare Dominum, quoad Divinum Verum in caelis, ac communicativum et 
receptivum ejus ibi, de qua n. 10,076.  Dicitur quod comedent sancta in quibus expiatum ad implendum manum eorum, et quod per illa significetur appropriatio boni apud illos qui purificati a malis et 
inde falsis, (o)ita ad recipiendum Divinum Verum; [2] cum hoc ita se habet: omnium primum quod appropriatur homini est bonum, ac successive verum; causa quod ita sit, est quia bonum est humus et verum 
est semen, ita similiter bonum adoptat verum ac conjungit sibi, quia amat illud sicut parens {1}; est enim conjugiale caeleste inter bonum et verum; et est bonum quod facit vitam apud hominem, quoniam 
bonum est voluntatis {2}, et voluntas hominis est ipse homo; at verum non facit vitam apud hominem nisi quantum a bono ducit; quoniam verum est intellectus, ac intellectus absque voluntate non est 
ipse homo, est modo introitus ad hominem, nam per intellectum intratur in voluntatem; [3] comparari potest homo cum domo in qua plura sunt conclavia, quorum unum ducit in alterum; qui in veris sunt solum 
quoad intellectum, illi non sunt in aliquo conclavi domus, sed modo in atrio; quantum autem verum per intellectum intrat in voluntatem, tantum in conclavia intrat, et habitat in domo; homo etiam in 
Verbo comparatur domui, ac verum quod solius intellectus comparatur atrio; at verum quod etiam factum est voluntatis, et ibi fit bonum, comparatur conclavi ubi habitatur, et ipsi cubiculo. 	[4] Quod 
bonum sit quod omnium primum a Domino appropriatur homini, constat ex infantia et ex prima pueritia ejus; quod tunc ei bonum innocentiae, ac bonum amoris erga parentes ac erga nutricem, ac bonum charitatis 
erga infantes socios sit, notum est; hoc bonum influit a Domino apud illos, ut inserviat in procedente aetate pro primo vitae Domini apud hominem, et sic pro plano recipiendi vera; conservatur 
(o)etiam hoc apud hominem cum adolescit, si non ipse destruit illud per vitam mali et inde fidem falsi.  Cum dicitur bonum, intelligitur charitas erga proximum et amor in Dominum, nam omne id quod est 
amoris et charitatis, est bonum.{3}  Quod bonum primo loco sit, et verum secundo, apud illos qui regenerantur, tametsi aliter apparet, videatur n. 3325, 3494, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 4925, 4926,
