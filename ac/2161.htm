<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2161节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2161.</strong>“容我拿点水来”表他们要靠近，并通过更接近其智性概念的神性事物而让自己降下来。这一点单从这句话（即他们要取点水）并不明显，但可从本节一系列事物，以及它们与上下文的联系清楚看出来。凭本节所说的这些话，没人知道“容我拿点水来，你们洗洗脚，在树下歇息歇息”表示神性要亲自下来，以更接近那时主所处的直觉状态，并且要披上某种属世之物，以便祂的直觉得以改善。事实上，人若从历史的角度解读这些话，则寻不到这一奥秘的蛛丝马迹。然而，我可以肯定地说，这就是它们的内义，天使就是以这种方式感知它们的。<br />这表明圣言蕴含何等伟大而深邃的奥秘。这一点可从这几句话的内义，也就是说从“水”、“脚”、“树”的含义进一步清楚看出来：“水”是指智性概念，“脚”是指属世事物，“树”是指直觉。一旦理解了这些事物，内义（即前面所述）就能从一系列事物，以及它们与上下文的联系看出来。“水”表记忆知识和理性概念，因而表理解力之物。这在第一卷早已说明（<a href="26.htm">26</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>节），也可从圣言中其它大量经文看出来，若在此引用这些经文，它们必占用大量篇幅。</p>

Let I pray a little water be taken. That this signifies that they should draw near, and let themselves down from things Divine nearer to His intellectual things, cannot be so evident from these words 
alone-that they should take a little water-but it is evident from the series of things in this verse, and from their connection with those which go before and those which follow. From what is said in 
this verse no one would ever know that the words "Let I pray a little water be taken, and wash ye your feet, and lie down under the tree" signify that the Divine should let itself down nearer to the 
state of perception in which the Lord then was, and should put on something natural in order that He might the better perceive; for not a trace of this arcanum is manifest in the words as understood historically; 
but that nevertheless such in the internal sense is their signification, and that the angels so perceive them, I know for certain. [2] This shows what great and deep arcana lie hidden in 
the Word. Moreover that such is the signification, may be seen from the signification in the internal sense of the several words, namely, from the signification of "water" as being intellectual things, 
from the signification of "feet" as being natural things, and from the signification of a "tree" as being perception. When these things are understood, the signification in the internal sense (to wit, 
that which has been stated) can be seen from the series of things, and from their connection with those which precede and those which follow. (That "waters" signify memory-knowledges and rational 
things, consequently the things of the understanding, has been shown in volume 1, n. 28, 680, and may be seen from very many other passages in the Word that it would be too tedious to bring forward.) </p>

That 'let now a little water be taken' means that they were to draw near and bring themselves down from Divine things nearer to His intellectual concepts does not become clear so much from these words 
alone that they should take a little water, as from the whole train of thought in this verse and from its connection with what comes before and after. From the actual words used in this verse no one 
could possibly know that 'let now a little water be taken, and wash your feet, and recline under the tree' meant that the Divine was to bring itself down nearer to that state of perception which was 
the Lord's at that time and was to put on something natural so that His perception might be improved. Indeed not the smallest trace of this arcanum is evident in these words if understood historically. 
That such is nevertheless their meaning in the internal sense, and that angels perceive them in that way, I know for certain. </p>

 This shows what great and deep arcana lie concealed in the Word. 
The same is further evident from the meaning of the words in the internal sense, that is to say, from the meaning of 'water' as intellectual concepts, from the meaning of 'feet' as natural things, and 
from the meaning of 'tree' as perception. Once these things are understood, then what is meant in the internal sense - namely that which has been stated - becomes clear from the train of thought and 
from its connection with what comes before and after. That 'waters' means factual knowledge and rational concepts, consequently intellectual concepts, has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, and may 
also become clear from very many other places in the Word, which would take up too much space if they were introduced here. </p>

Quod `accipiatur quaeso parum aquae' significet quo accederent seque demitterent a Divinis ad intellectualia Illius propius, non ita constare potest ex his verbis solum quod `acciperent parum aquae,' 
sed ex serie rerum quae in hoc versu, et earum nexu cum illis quae antecedunt et sequuntur; ex his quae in hoc versu, nusquam aliquis sciret quod `accipiatur quaeso parum aquae, et lavate pedes vestros, 
et incumbite sub arbore' significarent quod Divinum se demitteret propius ad perceptionis statum in quo tunc fuit Dominus, ac indueret aliquid naturale ut melius perciperet; non enim patet vestigium 
hujus arcani in {1} vocibus historice intellectis; sed quod usque significent illa in sensu interno, ac ita illa {2} percipiant angeli, pro certo scio; [2] exinde {3} constare potest quanta et quam 
alte arcana in Verbo latent; praeterea patere {4} potest (c)a significatione vocum in sensu interno, nempe ex significatione `aquae' quod sint intellectualia; (c)a significatione `pedum' quod sint naturalia; 
et (c)a significatione `arboris' quod sit perceptio; ex quibus intellectis, quid in sensu interno significant, a serie rerum et earum nexu cum antecedentibus et consequentibus constare potest, 
nempe quod illa quae dicta sunt: quod `aquae' significent scientifica et rationalia, proinde intellectualia, in Parte Prima n. (x)28, 680 ostensum est {5}; et ex perplurimis aliis locis in Verbo constare
