<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3009节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3009.</strong>其次：“弥赛亚”、“受膏者”、“王”和神圣真理是一样的，这从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，并且在前面解读中已频繁说明了（如<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。主自己在约翰福音也是这样教导的：<br />彼拉多就对耶稣说，那么你是王吗？耶稣回答说，你说我是王，我就是王；我为此而生，也为此来到世间，好给真理作见证。凡属真理的人就听我的声音。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.37.htm">18:37</a>）<br />由此明显可知，主正是由于神圣真理本身才被称为“王”。王之所以被膏，因而被称为受膏者，是因为他们被膏所用的油表示良善（<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="2832.htm">2832</a>节）。“王”所表示的真理源于良善，因而是良善的真理，因此王的职份和王代表主源于神圣良善的神圣真理，因而代表真理里面良善的神圣婚姻；而祭司的职份则代表良善里面真理的神圣婚姻。后者由“耶稣”来表示，前者则由“基督”来表示。</p>

Second: That "Messiah," "Anointed," and "King," are the same as the Divine truth, is evident from very many passages in the Word, and has been shown several times in the explications (as in n. 1672, 
1728, 2015, 2069); and the Lord Himself so teaches in John: </p>
<p>     Pilate said unto Jesus, Art Thou not a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King; for this was I born, and for this am come 
into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth; everyone who is of the truth heareth My voice (John 18:37). It is evident from this that it is the Divine truth itself from which the Lord 
was called "King." That kings were anointed, and were therefore called the anointed, was because the oil with which they were anointed signified good (n. 886, 2832), denoting that the truth signified 
by a "king" was from good, consequently was the truth of good; and thus that the royal office with kings might represent the Lord as to the Divine truth which is from Divine good, and thus the Divine 
marriage of good in truth; while the priestly office represented the Divine marriage of truth in good. The latter is signified by "Jesus;" the former by "Christ." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3009</b></p><p><b>3009.</b>
As to the second point - that Messiah, Anointed, or King is the same as Divine Truth - this is clear from very many places in the Word, and has been shown frequently in explanations; as in <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>. The Lord Himself also teaches the same in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Pilate said to Jesus, Are you not then a king? Jesus answered, You say it, because I am a King. For this I was born, and for this I have 
come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2018:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 18:37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is clear that the Divine Truth itself is at the root of the Lord's being called 
'the King'. The reason why kings were anointed and consequently called the anointed was that 'the oil' with which they were anointed meant good, <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="2832.htm">2832</a>. Also the truth, meant by 'king', was derived 
from good and was accordingly truth grounded in good, so that the kingly office with them represented the Lord as regards Divine Truth which is derived from Divine Good, and so represented the 
Divine marriage of good within truth, whereas the priestly function represented the Divine marriage of truth within good. The latter is meant by Jesus, the former by Christ. </p>

Quod alterum attinet, nempe quod Messias, Unctus et Rex sit idem ac Divinum Verum, constat a plurimis locis in Verbo, et ostensum est aliquoties in explicationibus, ut n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069; ac 
Ipse Dominus hoc docet apud Johannem,           Dixit ad Jesum {1}Pilatus, Nonne ergo Rex es Tu?      respondit Jesus, Tu dicis, quia Rex sum; Ego in hoc natus sum,      et in hoc veni in mundum, ut 
testimonium dem veritati, omnis      qui est ex veritate, audit vocem Meam, xviii 37; </p>
<p>inde constat quod ipsum Divinum Verum sit, ex quo Dominus Rex dictus: quod ungerentur reges, et inde dicti uncti, 
erat quia `oleum' quo ungebantur, significabat bonum, n. 886, 2832, et quod verum, quod `rex' significabat, esset ex bono, ita boni verum, et sic `regium' apud illos repraesentaret Dominum quoad Divinum 
Verum quod est ex Divino Bono, ita conjugium Divinum boni in vero; at `sacerdotale' conjugium Divinum veri in bono; hoc significatur per `Jesum,' illud per `Christum. @1 before ad$  </p>
