<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4154节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4154.</strong>“就从利亚的帐棚出来，进了拉结的帐棚”表那真理的神圣。这从刚才所述清楚可知。和良善一样，真理也分为外层和内层；因为既有一个内在人，也有一个外在人。内在人的良善与真理被称作内在良善与真理，而外在人的良善与真理则被称作外在良善与真理。内在人的良善与真理如在三层天堂那样，具有三个层级。外在人的良善与真理也具有三个层级，并对应于内在良善与真理。事实上，在内在人与外在人中间也有良善与真理，也就是中间的良善与真理；因为若没有这些中间或居间良善与真理，沟通或交流是不可能的。有些良善与真理适合属世人，被称作外在良善与真理；还有些属于身体的感官良善与真理，这些是最外在的。最后提到的这些良善与真理同样具有三个层级，属于外在人，并且如前所述，它们与同样多的内在人的良善并真理相对应；对此，按照主的圣治，我将别处予以论述。<br />各层级的良善与真理彼此完全没，互相分离，绝不会混在一起。更内在的是构成的成分，更外在的是合成物；或也可说，更内在的是赋予形式的，更外在的是接受这形式的。尽管这些良善与真理彼此完全不同，互相分离，但在人看来，它们并没有什么不同。感官人只能看到一切内层事物，甚至一切内在事物本身仅仅是感官的，或纯粹是以感官所感知到的物体；因为他从感官，因而从最外在的角度来看待事物。内层事物无法从最外在之物被看到，而最外在之物则能从内层事物被看到。属世人，也就是凭记忆知识思考的人，只知道他所思想的的属世之物是至内在的；而事实上，它们都是外在的。而相对内在的人则通过凭属世的记忆知识所揭示的分析论据进行判断并得出结论，他们以同样的方式相信这些是人所拥有的至内在之物，因为它们在他看来似乎就是至内在的。实际上，它们还在他的理性概念之下，因而相对于纯正的理性概念，它们更外在或更低层。这就是人对事物的领悟力的情形。刚才所讨论的事涉及存在于三个层级中的属世人或外在人。但如前所述，属于内在人的事物如在三层天堂那样也存在于三个层级中。<br />综上所述，可以看出，“家中神像”所表示的真理是何情形，因为它们没有在雅各、利亚或使女们的帐棚中被找到，而是在拉结的帐棚里，也就是在对内层真理的情感的神圣里面。出自神性的一切真理都存在于神圣中，它不可能有别的情形，因为出自神性的真理都是神圣的。它凭从主所流入的情感，也就是爱而被称为神圣，并促使真理激发人的情感。</p>

And he went out of Leah's tent, and came into Rachel's tent. That this signifies the holy of that truth, is evident from what has just been said. The case with truths (as with goods) is that they are 
exterior and interior; for there is an internal man and an external. It is the goods and truths of the internal man that are called internal goods and truths, and the goods and truths of the external 
man are called external goods and truths. The goods and truths of the internal man are of three degrees, such as there are in the three heavens. The goods and truths of the external man are also of three 
degrees and they correspond to the internal ones; for there are goods and truths midway between the internal and external man (that is, mediating ones); for without middle or mediating goods and 
truths no communication is possible. There are goods and truths proper to the natural man, which are called external goods and truths; and there are also goods and truths of the senses which are of the 
body, and thus outermost ones. These last mentioned goods and truths of three degrees belong to the external man, and as before said they correspond to as many goods and truths of the internal man; 
concerning which of the Lord's Divine Providence elsewhere.  [2] The goods and truths of each degree are most distinct from one another, and are by no means confused together. Those which are more interior 
are component, and those which are more exterior are composite. Although these goods and truths are most distinct from one another, they nevertheless do not appear to man as distinct. The sensuous 
man sees no otherwise than that all interior things, nay, internal things themselves, are only sensuous, for he sees from sensuous things, thus from outermost ones. Interior things cannot be seen 
from outermost things, but outermost things can be seen from interior things. He who is a natural man (that is, who thinks from memory-knowledges) knows no otherwise than that the natural things from 
which he thinks are inmost, when in fact they are external. The interior man, who judges and concludes from analytic principles that have been disclosed by virtue of natural memory-knowledges, believes 
in like manner that these are the inmost things which man possesses, because they appear as the inmost to him; and yet these are below his rational things, so that relatively to genuine rational things 
they are exterior or lower. Such is the case with man's apprehension. The things just spoken of are those of the natural or external man in three degrees; but as before said those of the internal 
man are also in three degrees such as there are in the three heavens. [3] From all that has been said it may now be seen how the case is with the truths signified by the "teraphim," in that they were 
not found in the tents of Jacob, Leah, or the handmaids, but in Rachel's tent, that is, in the holy of the affection of interior truth. All the truth that is from the Divine is in that which is holy, 
for it cannot be otherwise, because the truth that is from the Divine is holy. It is said to be holy from the affection (that is, from the love) which flows in from the Lord, and causes the man to be 
affected with the truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4154</b></p><p><b>4154.</b>
'And he went out of Leah's tent and came into Rachel's tent' means the holiness of that truth. This is clear from what has been stated immediately above. Truths, like goods, divide into exterior and 
interior ones, for there is an internal man and an external man. The internal man's goods and truths are called internal goods and truths, while the external man's are referred to as external goods and 
truths. The internal man's goods and truths exist in three degrees, as they do in the three heavens; and the external man's goods and truths likewise exist in three degrees and correspond to those internal 
ones. Indeed there are goods and truths which stand midway between the internal man and the external, which are intermediaries, for without those that are midway or intermediary no communication 
is possible. There are goods and truths proper to the natural man which are called external goods and truths, and there are also sensory goods and truths which belong to the body and so are the most 
external. These goods and truths existing in three degrees belong to the external man and, as has been stated, correspond to the same number of goods and truths of the internal man, which will in the 
Lord's Divine Providence be dealt with elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The goods and truths belonging to each degree are entirely distinct and separate from one another and not in the least muddled up. The more interior 
are ones which give form, and the more exterior are ones which receive it. But although they are entirely distinct and separate from one another they are not seen by man as being distinct. Anyone 
who is sensory-minded cannot do other than regard all interior things, and indeed internal things themselves, as being merely objects perceived with the senses; for he sees things from the senses 
and so from a very external point of view. Interior things cannot possibly be seen from the most external, but the most external can be seen from interior things. The natural man, that is, one who bases 
his thinking on facts, cannot see other than that the natural things on which his thinking is based are inmost things, when in reality they are external. And the more interior man, who bases his judgements 
and conclusions on analytical arguments revealed by natural facts, in a similar way believes that they are the inmost things which man possesses, because they seem to him to be the inmost. Actually 
they come below his rational ideas, and so in relation to genuine rational ideas are more exterior or lower. Such is the manner of man's mental grasp of things. The matters which have just been 
discussed concern the natural or external man existing in three degrees. But those which belong to the internal man also exist, as has been stated, in three degrees, as they do in the three heavens. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
From these considerations that have now been mentioned one may see what is implied by truths, meant by 'the teraphim', not being found in the tents of Jacob, Leah, or the servant-girls, but in 
Rachel's tent, that is, within the holiness of the affection for interior truth. All truth which comes from the Divine exists within holiness, for it cannot be otherwise, seeing that truth which comes 
from the Divine is holy. It is called holy from the affection, that is, from the love which flows in from the Lord and causes truth to stir a person's affection. </p>

`Et exivit e tentorio Leae, et venit in tentorium Rachelis': quod significet sanctum illius veri, constat ex illis quae mox supra dicta sunt. Cum veris se habet, sicut cum bonis, quod exteriora et 
interiora sint; est enim internus homo et externus; interni hominis bona et vera sunt quae vocantur bona et vera interna, et {1} externi hominis bona et vera dicuntur bona et vera externa; interni 
hominis bona et vera sunt triplicis gradus qualia sunt in tribus caelis; externi hominis bona et vera etiam sunt triplicis gradus et correspondent internis; sunt enim bona et vera media inter internum 
et externum hominem, seu mediantia, nam absque mediis seu mediantibus non datur communicatio; sunt bona et vera propria {2} naturalis hominis quae bona et vera externa appellantur; et sunt quoque 
bona et vera sensualia quae sunt corporis, ita extima; haec bona et vera triplicis gradus pertinent ad externum hominem et correspondent totidem bonis et veris interni hominis, ut dictum, de quibus, 
ex Divina Domini Providentia, alibi: </p>
<p>[2] bona et vera cujusvis gradus inter se distinctissima sunt, et minime confunduntur; quae interiora sunt, sunt componentia, et quae exteriora, sunt composita; 
haec tametsi inter se distinctissima sunt, usque non apparent homini ut distincta; qui sensualis homo est, non videt aliter quam (o)quod omnia interiora, immo ipsa interna, sint modo sensualia, 
ex sensualibus enim videt, ita ab extimis; ab extimis [videri] interiora nusquam possunt, sed extima ab interioribus; qui naturalis homo est, hoc est, qui ex scientificis cogitat, is non aliter 
scit quam quod naturalia ex quibus cogitat, sint intima, cum tamen sunt externa; interior homo, qui ex analyticis detectis {3} ex scientificis naturalibus judicat et concludit, {4} similiter credit 
quod illa intima hominis sint, quia ut intima ei apparent, sed usque sunt infra rationale ita respective ad genuina rationalia sunt exteriora seu inferiora; ita se habet cum captu hominis; sunt 
haec de quibus nunc dictum, naturalis seu externi hominis in triplici gradu {5}; sed illa quae sunt interni hominis, etiam in triplici gradu, (t)ut dictum, sunt, qualia {6} in tribus caelis.  Ex his 
quae nunc dicta sunt, constare potest quomodo se {7} habet cum veris quae significantur per teraphim, quod non inventi sint {8} in tentoriis Jacobi, Leae et ancillarum {9}, sed in tentorio Rachelis, 
hoc est, in sancto affectionis veri interioris.  Omne verum quod a Divino, est in sancto, nam non aliter {10} potest esse quia verum quod a Divino, est sanctum; sanctum dicitur ab affectione, hoc 
est, ab amore qui a Domino influit et facit ut homo afficiatur vero.      @1 at$      @2 A d propria, i ipsissima$      @3 deductis$      @4 i is$      @5 i sunt$      @6 i sunt$      @7 i
