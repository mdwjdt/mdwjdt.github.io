<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3318.</strong>“累昏了”表争战的状态。这从“累昏”或“疲惫”的含义清楚可知，“累昏”或“疲惫”是指争战后的状态，在此是指争战的状态，因为所论述的主题是良善与真理在属世人里面的联结。“累昏”在此表争战的状态，这一点并不明显，除非通过内义上的整个思路，尤其通过以下事实来看：没有争战，或也可说，没有试探，良善无法与真理在属世人里面联结。<br />为了让人们了解该状态的性质（尽管只有在人经历它的时候才知道），现对它作以简要说明。人无非是从主接受生命的一个器官或器皿，因为人不是靠自己活着（<a href="290.htm">290</a>，<a href="1954.htm">1954</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="2536.htm">2536</a>，<a href="2706.htm">2706</a>，<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>，<a href="3001.htm">3001</a>节）。从主流入人里面的生命来自祂的神圣之爱。这爱，或源于这爱的生命流入并适应在人的理性人和属世人中的器皿。由于人生来所进入的遗传邪恶和他所获得的实际邪恶，相对于接受所流入的生命来说，这些器皿处于相反的位置。不过，所流入的生命越是重新设置这些器皿以接受它，就越如此重新设置它们。理性人和属世人中的这些器皿被称为真理，而真理本身无非是对这些器皿形式的变动（variations）和以不同方式产生这些变动的状态变化（changes）的感知，这些变动以最精妙的有机物质和无法形容的方式产生（<a href="2487.htm">2487</a>节）。具有主之生命的良善本身，也就是生命，流入并重新设置它们。<br />这些器皿因它们所取的形式而各异。如前所述，当对于所流入的生命来说，它们处于相反的位置和方向时，显然，它们必须复位，以接受这生命，也就是说，由这生命来掌控。只要人仍处在他生来所进入或他带给自己的这种状态，这一切决无可能实现。那时，这些器皿并不顺从，因为它们顽固抗拒并强硬反对生命行事所遵照的天堂秩序。因为驱动它们、它们所顺从的良善源于自我之爱和对这个世界的爱。这良善通过它所含有的燥热而使这些器皿具有这样的性质。因此，它们在变得顺从、能接受属于主之爱的生命之前，必须被软化。这种软化只能通过试探实现，因为试探能除去那些构成自我之爱，并与自我相比对他人的蔑视之物，因而除去构成自我荣耀，以及缘于此的仇恨和报复之物。所以，当这些器皿通过试探在某种程度上变得软化和柔和时，它们就开始屈服，并顺从属于主之爱、不断流入人里面的生命。<br />自这时起，良善开始与真理联结，先是在理性人里面，然后在属世人里面。因为如前所述，真理无非是对形式变动（variations）的感知，而这些形式变动是由不断变化的状态所决定的；这些感知就来自所流入的生命。这就是为何人通过试探，或也可说，通过属灵的争战重生，即新造，然后被赋予不同于以前的另外一种内在性情，也就是说，变得温和、谦卑、简单，并发自内心痛悔的原因。由此可见试探所起的作用，也就是说，来自主的良善不仅能流入进来，还能使这些器皿变得顺从，从而与它们联结。因为真理是接受良善的器皿（参看<a href="1496.htm">1496</a>，<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2261.htm">2261</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>节）。此处由于所论述的主题是良善与真理在属世人里面的联结，并且联结的第一个阶段通过试探所带来的争战进行，故显而易见，“累昏了”表争战的状态。<br />但就至高意义而言，此处论述的主题是主。祂通过最严厉的试探争战而使自己里面的一切事物归入神序，以致祂从母亲那里所得来的人性的一切没有丝毫存留（<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>，<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2574.htm">2574</a>，<a href="2649.htm">2649</a>，<a href="3036.htm">3036</a>节），所以祂不像其他人那样是新造的，而完全变成了神性。因为通过重生新造的人仍保留向恶的倾向在里面，甚至保留邪恶本身，只是被主之爱的生命的流注和极其强大的力量拦住罢了。而主完全抛弃了从母亲那里遗传给祂的一切邪恶，使自己变成神性，甚至连这些器皿，即真理也变成了神性。这就是圣言中所谓的“荣耀”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3318</b></p><p><b>3318.</b>
And he was weary. That this signifies a state of combat, is evident from the signification of "weary," or "weariness," as being the state after combat; here, a state of combat, because the subject is 
the conjunction of good with truth in the natural man. That "weary" here signifies a state of combat, cannot appear except from the series of things in the internal sense, and especially from the consideration 
that good cannot be conjoined with truth in the natural man without combats, or what is the same, without temptations. That it may be known how the case herein is in respect to man, it shall 
be briefly told.  [2] Man is nothing but an organ, or vessel, which receives life from the Lord; for man does not live from himself (n. 290, 1954, 2021, 2536, 2706, 2886-3001). The life which inflows 
with man from the Lord is from His Divine love. This love, or the life thence derived, inflows and applies itself to the vessels which are in man's rational, and to those which are in his natural. 
In consequence of the hereditary evil into which man is born, and of the actual evil which he acquires, these vessels are in a contrary position within him relatively to the inflowing life, yet insofar 
as the life which flows in can dispose the vessels to receive it, it does so dispose them. These vessels in the rational man, and in the natural, are what are called truths, but in themselves they are 
merely perceptions of the variations of form of these vessels, and of the changes of state according to which in divers ways these variations come forth, being effected in the most subtle substances, 
by methods inexpressible (n. 2487). Good itself, which has life from the Lord, or which is life, is that which flows in and disposes.  [3] When therefore these vessels, which are to be varied as to 
forms, are as before said in a contrary position and direction in respect to the life, it is evident that they must be reduced to a position in accordance with the life, or into compliance with it. 
This cannot possibly be effected so long as the man is in that state into which he is born, and to which he has reduced himself; for the vessels are not obedient, being obstinately resistant, and hardening 
themselves against the heavenly order according to which the life acts; for the good which moves them, and with which they comply, is of the love of self and of the world; which good, from the gross 
heat that is in it, causes them to be of such a quality; and therefore before they can be rendered compliant and fit to receive anything of the life of the Lord's love, they must be softened. This 
softening is effected by no other means than temptations; for temptations remove all that is of the love of self and of contempt for others in comparison with self, consequently all that is of self-glory, 
and also of hatred and revenge on this account. When therefore the vessels have been somewhat tempered and subdued by temptations, they begin to become yielding to, and compliant with, the life 
of the Lord's love, which continually flows in with man. [4] Hence then it is that good begins to be conjoined with truths; first in the rational man, and afterwards in the natural; for as before said 
truths are nothing else than perceptions of the variations of form according to states that are continually being changed; and these perceptions are from the life which flows in. This is the reason 
why man is regenerated, that is, made new, by temptations; or what is the same, by spiritual combats; and that he is afterwards gifted with another nature; being made mild, humble, simple, and contrite 
in heart. From these considerations it may now be seen what use temptations promote, namely, that good from the Lord may not only flow in, but may also dispose the vessels to obedience, and thus conjoin 
itself with them. That truths are vessels receptive of good, may be seen above (n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269). Here therefore, because the subject is the conjunction of good and truth in 
the natural man, and the first of conjunction takes place by means of combats, which are those of temptations, it is evident that by "he was weary" is signified a state of combat.  [5] But as regards 
the Lord, who in the supreme sense is here treated of, He by the most grievous temptation combats reduced all things in Himself into Divine order, insomuch that there remained nothing at all of the 
human which He had derived from the mother (n. 1444, 1573, 2159, 2574, 2649, 3036), so that He was not made new as are other men, but altogether Divine. For the man who is made new by regeneration still 
retains in himself an inclination to evil, and even evil itself; but is withheld from evil by an influx of the life of the Lord's love, and this with a force exceedingly great; whereas the Lord utterly 
cast out all the evil that was hereditary to Him from the mother, and made Himself Divine, even as to the vessels, that is, as to truths. This is that which in the Word is called "glorification." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3318</b></p><p><b>3318.</b>
'And he was weary' means a state of conflict. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'weary' or weariness as the state following conflict Here however, because the subject is a state of conflict in which 
good and truth within the natural man are joined together, the state of conflict itself is meant. As regards 'weary' here meaning a state of conflict, this is not apparent except from the train of 
thought in the internal sense, and in particular from the fact that without conflicts, or what amounts to the same, without temptations, good is unable to be joined to truth in the natural man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
So that the nature of this state may be known - though only as man experiences it - let a brief statement be made regarding it. Man is nothing other than an organ or vessel which receives life from 
the Lord, for man does not live of himself, <a href="290.htm">290</a>, <a href="1954.htm">1954</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="2536.htm">2536</a>, <a href="2706.htm">2706</a>, <a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>, <a href="3001.htm">3001</a>. The life flowing in with man from the Lord comes from His Divine Love. This Love, that is, the life from it, 
flows in and applies itself to the vessels that are in man's rational and that are in his natural. On account of the hereditary evil into which man is born, and on account of the evil of his own doing 
which man acquires to himself, these vessels with him are set the wrong way round for receiving that life. But insofar as it is possible for this inflowing life to do so, it resets those vessels to receive 
it. These vessels within the rational man and within his natural are such as are called truths. In themselves they are nothing else than perceptions of the variations in form possessed by those 
vessels and of the changes of state which in different ways give rise to those variations, which are produced in the most delicate of organic substances, and in ways that defy description, <a href="2487.htm">2487</a>. Good 
itself, which possesses life from the Lord, that is, which is life, is that which flows in and resets them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When therefore those vessels, varying in the forms they take, are set and turned, as 
has been stated, the wrong way round for inflowing life, they clearly have to be re-positioned to receive that life, that is, to be controlled by it. This cannot possibly be effected as long as the person 
remains in that condition into which he was born or which he has brought upon himself. Indeed at that time they are unsubmissive because they resolutely withstand and harden themselves against the 
heavenly order governing the way that life acts. Indeed the good which moves them, and to which they are subservient, is that which stems from self-love and love of the world. From the dull warmth 
it contains that good makes these vessels what they are. Consequently before they can be made submissive and capable of receiving any of the life that belongs to the Lord's love, they have to be softened. 
The only ways that such softening can be achieved is by temptations, for temptations take away the things that constitute self-love and contempt for others in comparison with oneself, consequently 
that constitute self-glory, and also hatred and revenge on account of that. When therefore they have to some extent been subdued and mellowed by means of temptations those vessels start to become yielding 
and compliant to the life which belongs to the Lord's love and which is constantly flowing in with man.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this point onwards good, first of all in the rational man and then in the natural, 
starts to be joined to the truths there, for as has been stated, truths are nothing else than perceptions of the variations in form which are determined by the states that are changing all the 
time - those perceptions being a product of the life that is flowing in. This is the reason why a person is regenerated, that is, is made new, by means of temptations, or what amounts to the same, by 
means of spiritual conflicts, and after that receives an inward disposition different from before, that is to say, becomes gentle, humble, single-minded, and contrite at heart. From these considerations 
one may now see the use served by temptations, which is that good from the Lord may not only flow in but also render the vessels subservient and so join itself to them. For truths are the recipient 
vessels of good, see <a href="1496.htm">1496</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2261.htm">2261</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>. Here therefore, since the subject is the joining together of good and truth in the natural man, and since the first stage of that conjunction 
comes about through the conflicts brought about by temptations, 'he was weary' clearly means a state of conflict. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 As for the Lord however, who is the subject here in the highest sense, He so imposed 
Divine order on everything within Himself by means of the very severe conflicts that went with temptations that nothing remained of the human He had derived from the mother, <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="2574.htm">2574</a>, <a href="2649.htm">2649</a>, <a href="3036.htm">3036</a>, so that He was not made new as any other human being but was made altogether Divine. For man, who is made new through regeneration, nevertheless retains within himself the inclination 
towards evil; indeed he retains the evil itself but is withheld from it by the influx of the life that is the life of the Lord's love, and by an extremely powerful force. But the Lord cast out completely 
everything evil that was His by heredity from the mother and made Himself Divine, doing so even as to the vessels, that is, as to the truths. This is what in the Word is called Glorification. </p>

`Et is lassus': quod significet statum pugnae, constare potest a significatione `lassi seu lassitudinis' quod sit status post pugnam, hic status pugnae quia agitur de statu conjunctionis boni cum vero 
in naturali homine; quod `lassus' hic significet statum pugnae, non constare potest nisi ex serie rerum in sensu interno, et inde praecipue quod bonum cum vero in naturali homine non conjungi possit 
absque pugnis, seu quod idem, absque tentationibus: [2] ut sciatur quomodo hoc se habet, sed apud hominem, paucis dicendum: homo non est aliud quam organum seu vas quod recipit vitam a Domino, ex se 
enim homo non vivit, n. 290, 1954, 2021, 2536, 2706, 2886-2889, 3001; vita quae influit apud hominem a Domino, est ex Divino ipsius Amore; hic seu vita inde, influit et se applicat vasis quae in rationali 
et quae in naturali hominis; haec vasa apud hominem in contrario situ sunt respective ad vitam ex malo hereditario in quod nascitur homo, et ex malo actuali quod ipse sibi comparat; quantum vero 
vita quae influit, disponere potest vasa ad se recipiendum, tantum disponit; vasa haec in rationali homine, et in naturali ejus, sunt illa quae vocantur vera, et in se non sunt nisi {1}perceptiones variationum 
formae illorum vasorum, ac mutationum status secundum quas diversimode variationes existunt, quae fiunt in subtilissimis substantiis {2}, modis inexpressibilibus, n. 2487; ipsum bonum cui est 
vita a Domino, seu quod est vita, {3}est quod influit et disponit; [3] cum itaque vasa illa quae varianda quoad formas, in contrario situ et versu sunt respective ad vitam, ut dictum, constare potest 
quod illa redigenda sint in situm secundum vitam, seu in obsequium vitae; hoc fieri nequaquam potest quamdiu homo in illo statu est in quem natus, et in quem semet redegit, non enim oboediunt quia 
sunt obnixe resistentia, (c)et contra caelestem ordinem secundum quem agit vita, se obfirmantia; bonum enim quod movet illa, et cui obsequuntur, est amoris sui et mundi; hoc ex crasso calore qui inest, 
facit ut illa sint talia; quare antequam obsequiosa {4}fieri, et aliquid vitae amoris Domini recipiendi idonea esse possunt, emollienda sunt; emollitio illa non per alia media fit quam per tentationes; 
tentationes enim auferunt illa quae sunt amoris sui, et quae sunt contemptus aliorum prae se, consequenter quae sunt sui gloriae, tum quae sunt odii et vindictae {5}eapropter; cum itaque a sunt aliquantum 
temperata et {6}domita per tentationes, tunc incipiunt vasa illa fieri cedentia, et obsecundantia vitae amoris Domini, quae continue apud hominem influit; [4] inde nunc est quod bonum, {7}primo 
rationali homine, deinde in naturali, incipiat conjungi veris ibi, nam vera, ut dictum est, non sunt aliud quam perceptiones variationum formae secundum status qui continue mutantur, et perceptiones 
sunt a vita quae influit; {8}inde causa quod homo per tentationes, seu quod idem, per pugnas spirituales regeneretur, hoc est, fiat novus, et quod donetur alia indole postea, nempe quod fiat mansuetus, 
humilis, simplex {9}et contritus corde; ex his nunc constare potest quem usum praestant tentationes, nempe illum quod bonum a Domino non modo influere possit, sed etiam disponere vasa ad oboedientiam, 
et sic se cum illis conjungere: quod vera sint vasa recipientia boni, videatur n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2061, 2269. Hic itaque quia agitur de conjunctione boni et veri in naturali homine, (c)et 
primum conjunctionis existit per pugnas quae sunt tentationum, constare potest quod per `is lassus' significetur status pugnae. [5] Quod autem Dominum attinet, de Quo in supremo sensu hic agitur, Ipse 
per pugnas tentationum gravissimas, redegit omnia in Se in ordinem Divinum, usque adeo ut nihil usquam remanserit ex humano quod traxerat a matre, n. 1444, 1573, 2159, 2574, 2649, 3036, sic ut non novas

amoris Domini, et hoc vi admodum forti; at Dominus omne malum quod Ipsi hereditarium fuit a matre, prorsus ejecit, et Se Divinum fecit, etiam quoad vasa, hoc est, quoad vera; hoc est quod in Verbo vocatur
