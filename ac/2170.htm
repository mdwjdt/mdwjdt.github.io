<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2170节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2170.</strong>创世记18:6. 亚伯拉罕赶快进帐棚，到撒拉那里，说，快准备三斗细面饭，和一和，作些饼。<br />“亚伯拉罕赶快进帐棚，到撒拉那里”表主的理性良善与祂的真理结合：“亚伯拉罕”在此是指处于当时状态下的主的良善；“撒拉”是指主的真理；“帐棚”是指主的爱之圣洁。“说”表当时主相对直觉的状态。“快准备三斗细面饭，和一和，作些饼”表处于当时状态下主的爱之属天事物：“三”表神圣之物；“细面饭”表当时主所具有的理性的属灵成分和属天成分；“饼”（cakes）同样表属灵成分和属天成分，只是此时这二者已联结在一起。</p>

Verse 6. And Abraham hastened toward the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of meal of fine flour, knead, and make cakes. "Abraham hastened toward the tent unto Sarah," signifies 
the Lord's rational good conjoined with His truth; "Abraham" is here the Lord in that state as to good; "Sarah," as to truth; the "tent," as to the holy of love: "and said," signifies the state 
of perception relatively at that time; "make ready quickly three measures of meal of fine flour, knead, and make cakes," signifies the celestial of His love in that state; "three" denotes what is holy; 
"meal of fine flour," is the spiritual and the celestial of the rational which were then with the Lord; "cakes" denote the same when both are conjoined. </p>

Verse 6 And Abraham hastened towards the tent to Sarah, and said, Take quickly three measures of meal of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes. </p>
<p>'Abraham hastened towards the tent to Sarah' means the 
Lord's rational good joined to His truth - 'Abraham' here being the Lord in that state as regards good, 'Sarah' as regards truth, 'the tent' as regards the holiness of love. 'And he said' means as it 
related to the Lord's state of perception at that time. 'Take quickly three measures of meal of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes' means the celestial existence of His love in that state - 'three' 
meaning that which is holy, 'meal of fine flour' the spiritual and celestial ingredients of the rational which were present at that time with the Lord, 'cakes' the same when both had been joined together. </p>

Vers. 6.  Et festinavit Abraham versus tentorium ad Sarah, et dixit, Festina tria sata farinae similaginis, pinse et fac placentas.  `Festinavit Abraham versus tentorium ad Sarah' significat rationale 
bonum Domini conjunctum vero Ipsius; `Abraham' est hic Dominus in illo statu quoad bonum, `Sarah' quoad verum, `tentorium' quoad sanctum (o)amoris: `et dixit' significat perceptionis statum tunc respective: 
`festina tria sata farinae similaginis, pinse, et fac placentas' significat caeleste amoris Ipsius in illo statu; `tria' sunt sancta, `farina similaginis' est spirituale et caeleste rationalis 
quod tunc apud Dominum, `placentae' similiter cum utrumque conjunctum. </p>
