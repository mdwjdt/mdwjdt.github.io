<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5068节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5068.</strong>主之所以在这些话中自称王，即：当人子在祂荣耀里，降临的时候，祂要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上……，于是对他们说，是因为主的王权是神性真理，审判基于并照着神性真理来实施。但审判的基础和实施对善人是一种情况，对恶人又是另一种情况。善人因接受神性真理，故审判他们的基础是良善，因而是怜悯；恶人因不接受神性真理，故审判他们的基础是真理，因而不是怜悯；因为他们总是弃绝怜悯，因而在来世继续弃绝怜悯。接受神性真理意味着不仅拥有信仰，还实践信仰，也就是将教义所教导的融入生活。正因如此，主自称“王”。主的王权就是神性真理（参看<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>e，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。</p>

That the Lord calls Himself "King"-in these words: When the Son of man shall come in His glory, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory, then shall the King say unto them; is because the Lord's 
royalty is the Divine truth, from which and according to which judgment is effected. But from and according to it the good are judged in one way, and the evil in another. The good, because they have 
received Divine truth, are judged from good, and thus from mercy; the evil, because they have not received Divine truth, are judged from truth, and thus not from mercy; for this they have rejected, and 
hence they continue to reject it in the other life. To receive Divine truth is not only to have faith, but also to practice it, that is, to cause that which is of doctrine to become of the life. It 
is from this that the Lord calls Himself "King." (That the Lord's royalty is the Divine truth has been shown above, n. 1728, 2015, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966.) </p>

The reason the Lord calls Himself 'the King' in the following words - 'When the Son of Man comes in His glory, He will sit on the throne of [His] glory.....Then the King will say to them' - is that the 
Lord's kingly rule is Divine Truth, on which judgement is based and in accordance with which it is executed. But the basis and execution of judgement in the case of the good is different from what 
it is with the evil. Because the good have accepted Divine Truth, the basis on which they are judged is good, and so mercy; but because the evil have not accepted Divine Truth, the basis of their judgement 
is truth, but not mercy, for the reason that they have cast mercy aside and as a consequence are constantly casting it aside in the next life. The acceptance of Divine Truth implies not only possessing 
faith but also expressing that faith in action, that is, making what doctrine teaches a matter of life. These are the reasons why the Lord calls Himself 'the King'. The Lord's kingly rule consists 
in Divine Truth, see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>(end), <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. </p>

</p><b>5068.</b>
Quod Dominus se `Regem' dicat his verbis, `Quando venerit Filius hominis in gloria Sua, sedebit super throno gloriae; tunc dicet Rex illis', est causa quia regium Domini est Divinum Verum, ex quo 
et secundum quod fit judicium; sed ex illo et secundum illud judicantur aliter boni et aliter mali; boni quia receperunt Divinum Verum, judicantur ex bono, ita ex misericordia; mali quia non receperunt 
Divinum Verum, judicantur ex vero, ita non ex misericordia, hanc enim rejecerunt et inde in altera vita continue rejiciunt. Recipere Divinum Verum est non modo fidem habere sed etiam fidem agere, 
hoc est, quod doctrinae est, facere ut sit vitae. Inde est quod Dominus Se Regem dicat: quod regium Domini sit Divinum Verum, videatur n. 1728, 2015 f, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966. </p>
