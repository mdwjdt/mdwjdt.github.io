<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4113节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4113.</strong>“没告诉他就逃走了”表通过分离。这是显而易见的，无需解释。 “雅各窃取了亚兰人拉班的心，没告诉他就逃走了”在历史意义上是指雅各使拉班得着雅各一切事物的希望落空，并使他陷入沮丧的状态。因为拉班原以为雅各服事了他，雅各的一切事物就都成了他的；不仅包括他的女儿，也就是雅各的妻子，他们的儿女，还包括他的羊群，这符合那个时代所公认并接受的律法，该律法被记载于摩西五经：<br />你若买希伯来人作奴仆，他必服事你六年，第七年他可以自由，白白地出去。他主人若给他妻子，妻子给他生了儿子和女儿，妻子和儿女要归主人，他要独自出去。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.2.htm">21:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.4.htm">4</a>）<br />拉班原先就是这样想的，这一事实从本章后面雅各的话明显看出来：<br />若不是我父亲的神，亚伯拉罕的神，就是以撒所敬畏的，与我同在，你如今必定打发我空手而去。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.42.htm">31:42</a>）<br />也可从拉班的话明显看出来：<br />拉班回答雅各说，这女儿是我的女儿，这儿子是我的儿子，这羊群也是我的羊群；凡你所看见的都是我的。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.43.htm">31:43</a>）<br />拉班没有考虑到这一事实：雅各不是被买来的仆人，事实上根本就不是仆人，他所属的家族，比拉班本人的还要高贵，而且雅各已经接受他的两个妻子及其羊群作为他的工价。既然如此，那么这条律法就不适用于雅各。现在由于雅各的逃跑，使拉班的这个希望落空，从而使他陷入沮丧的状态，故经上说“雅各窃取了亚兰人拉班的心，没告诉他就逃走了”。这些话在内义上表示通过分离，“拉班”所表良善的状态改变。关于通过分享所产生的状态改变，可参看刚才所述（<a href="4111.htm">4111</a>节）。</p>

In that he told him not that he was fleeing. That this signifies by the separation, is evident without explication. By "Jacob stole the heart of Laban, in that he told him not that he was fleeing," is 
meant in the historical sense that Jacob deprived Laban of the hope of getting possession of all things that were his, and reduced him to a state of distress. For Laban had believed that because Jacob 
served him, all things that were Jacob's became his; not only his daughters who were Jacob's wives, and their sons, but also his flocks, according to the known and received law of that time, as found 
in Moses: </p>
<p>     If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve, and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons and daughters, the 
wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out with his body (Exod. 21:2, 4). That he had so thought, is manifest from Jacob's words in what follows in this chapter: </p>
<p>     Except the 
God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty (Gen. 31:42); </p>
<p>and from Laban's: </p>
<p>     Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The 
daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that thou seest is mine (Gen. 31:43); </p>
<p>not considering that Jacob was not a bought servant, nor indeed a servant 
at all, and that he was of a more noble family than he, and also that he had received as his reward both his wives and his flock; so that the law did not apply to Jacob. Now as Jacob by his fleeing 
had deprived Laban of this hope, and thus had reduced him to a state of distress, it is said that he "stole the heart of Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he was fleeing." But by these words 
in the internal sense is signified the change by the separation of the state signified by "Laban" in respect to good. Concerning change of state by separation, see what has been said just above (n. 4111). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4113</b></p><p><b>4113.</b>
'By not giving him any indication that he was fleeing' means through the separation. This becomes clear without explanation. The statement that 'Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Aramean by not giving 
any indication that he was fleeing' is used in the historical sense to mean that Jacob deprived Laban of the hope of gaining possession of everything that was his and drove him into a state of dismay. 
For Laban believed that because Jacob served him everything belonging to Jacob would become his - not only his own daughters, who were Jacob's wives, and his daughters' sons, but also Jacob's flocks, 
according to the law known and accepted in those times, which is recorded in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If you buy a Hebrew slave he shall serve you six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. 
If his master has given him a wife and she has borne him sons and daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2021:2,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 21:2, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that Laban 
had this law in mind is evident from Jacob's words later on in this chapter, </p>
<blockquote>
Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me, you would now have sent me 
away empty-handed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2031:42&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 31:42</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And from Laban's words, </p>
<blockquote>
Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that you see 
is mine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2031:43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 31:43</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Laban was not taking into consideration the fact that Jacob had not been bought as a slave, nor indeed was a slave, or that he belonged to a more illustrious family than he himself 
did, or also that Jacob had received his wives as well as the flock as wages. All this being so, that law did not apply to Jacob. Because by his fleeing Jacob now deprived Laban of that hope and 
as a consequence drove him into a state of dismay it is said that 'he stole the heart of Laban the Aramean by not giving any indication that he was fleeing'. In the internal sense however these words 
mean a change as regards good of the state meant by 'Laban' through separation. Concerning a change of state effected through separation, see what has been stated just above in <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>.

`Per quod non indicavit ei quod fugiens is': quod significet per separationem, constare potest absque explicatione. Quod `Jacob furatus cor Labanis Aramaei per quod non indicavit ei, quod fugiens 
is' in sensu historico intelligitur quod Jacob deprivaverit Labanem spe possidendi omnia quae ejus erant, et in statum angustiae redegerit; Laban enim credidit, quia Jacob servivit ei, quod omnia 
quae Jacobi, fierent ejus, non modo mulieres Jacobi {1}, filiae suae, et filii illarum, sed etiam greges ejus, secundum legem tunc temporis etiam notam, et quoque receptam, de qua apud Mosen,     
      Si emeris servum Hebraeum, sex annis serviet, et in      septimo exibit liber gratis... si dominus ejus dederit ei      mulierum et pepererit ei filios et filias, mulier et nati      ejus erunt 
domini illius, et ille exibit cum corpore suo,      Exod. xxi 2, 4; </p>
<p>quod id cogitaverit, patet a Jacobi verbis in sequentibus hujus capitis,           Nisi Deus patris mei, Deus Abrahami, et pavor 
Jishaki,      fuisset mihi, quod nunc vacuum misisses me, vers. 42; </p>
<p>et a Labanis,           Respondit {2} Laban, et dixit ad Jacobum, Filiae filiae      meae, et filii filii mei, et grex grex 
meus, et omne quod tu      videns, mihi hoc, vers. 43; </p>
<p>non considerans quod Jacob non servus emptus fuisset, ne quidem servus, et quod ex nobiliore familia quam is, tum quod pro mercede acceperit 
tam mulieres quam gregem, et sic quod illa lex non pro Jacobo esset; quia nunc Jacob per id quod fugeret, Labanem illa spe deprivavit, ac inde illum in statum angustiae redegit, dicitur quod `furatus 
cor Labanis Aramaei, per id quod non indicavit ei quod fugiens is'; at in sensu interno per illa significatur mutatio status per `Labanem' significati quoad bonum per separationem: de status mutatione 
per separationem, videantur quae mox supra n. 4111 dicta sunt.      @1 ejus$      @2 i Et$ </p>
