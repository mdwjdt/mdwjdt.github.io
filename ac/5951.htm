<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5951节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5951.</strong>“以色列的儿子们就如此行”表通过属世层里面的属灵真理而付诸实施。这从“行”的含义和“以色列的儿子们”的代表清楚可知：“行”是指付诸实施；“以色列的儿子们”是指属世层里面的属灵真理（参看<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>节）。必须说明何为属世层里面的属灵真理。脱离世人、灵人或天使的信之真理其实并不是信之真理，因为它们没有依附于一个接受者，使得它们能在这接受者里面变成这类真理。但当它们依附于作为其接受者的世人、灵人或天使身上时，就变成了信之真理，然而却照着各人的生活状态而各不相同。对那些刚刚开始学习它们的人来说，它们不过是记忆知识而已。若后来这些人真正敬畏它们，那么真理就会从记忆知识继续向前发展，从而变成教会的真理。然而，当他们对这些真理拥有一种情感，并照之生活时，它们变成属灵真理；因为那时唯独来源于灵界的爱与仁之良善会充满它们，使给它们带来生命。事实上，对它们拥有一种情感并照之生活就源于这良善。<br />被称为信之真理的真理对那些照之生活的人来说是何品质，对那些不照之生活的人来说又是何性质，已经被指示给我。对那些照之生活的人来说，它们看似白线；对那些知道这些真理，却根本不行善的人来说，它们看似发硬但易碎的线。但对那些照之生活的人来说，它们看似从脑部延伸出来的纤维，这些纤维充满灵液（spirituous fluid），并且是柔软的。因此，后面这些真理是有生命的，而前者是没有生命的。由此可知，与人同在的真理之性质取决于各人的生活状态。“雅各的儿子们”所代表的真理虽是真理，但还不是属灵真理，因为它们还没有成为生活的事。但作为以色列的儿子们的这些人所代表的真理是属灵真理，因为它们已经成为生活的事，故而已充满爱与仁之良善。此处所指的是后面这些真理，因为所论述的主题是属世层中的真理，即“雅各的儿子们”与内在良善，即“约瑟”，通过居间层，即“便雅悯”，以及属灵良善，即“以色列”联结的初始阶段。</p>

And the sons of Israel did so. That this signifies the effect from spiritual truths in the natural, is evident from the signification of "did," as being the effect; and from the representation of the 
sons of Israel, as being spiritual truths in the natural (see n. 5414, 5879). What spiritual truths in the natural are, must be told. Truths of faith outside of man, spirit, or angel, are not truths 
of faith, for they have not been applied to any subject, in which they become such. But when they are applied to man, spirit, or angel as a subject, they then become truths of faith, but with a difference 
according to the states of life of each one. With those who are learning them for the first time, they are only memory-knowledges. Afterward if these persons devoutly reverence them, the truths advance 
further, and become truths of the church; and when they are affected with them and live according to them, they then become spiritual truths; for the good of love and of charity, which is solely 
from the spiritual world, then fills them and causes them to live; for to be affected with them and to live according to them is from this good. The quality of the truths that are called truths of faith, 
with those who live according to them, and with those who do not live according to them, has been shown me. With those who do not live according to them, they appeared like white filaments; and 
with those who had these truths, but nothing of good, they appeared brittle; but with those who live according to them they appeared like fibers from the brain filled with spirit, and soft. Thus these 
latter truths were animate, but the former were inanimate. From this it may be known that the quality of truths with men is according to the state of life of each. The truths that are represented by 
the sons of Jacob are truths not yet spiritual, because not yet made of the life. But the truths that are represented by them as sons of Israel are spiritual, because from having been made of the life 
they have been filled with the good of love and of charity. These latter truths are here meant, because the subject treated of has been the initiation to conjunction of the truths in the natural (which 
are the sons of Jacob) with internal good (which is Joseph), through the intermediate (which is Benjamin), and also through spiritual good (which is Israel). </p>

'And the sons of Israel did so' means a putting into effect by the spiritual truths within the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'they did' as a putting into effect; and from the representation 
of 'the sons of Israel' as the spiritual truths within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>. What spiritual truths within the natural are must be stated: The truths of faith if separate from man, 
spirit, or angel are not in fact the truths of faith, for they are not attached to a recipient in whom they become such truths. But when they are attached to man, spirit, or angel as their recipient 
they then become the truths of faith, yet varyingly so according to each individual's state of life. With those who are just beginning to learn them they are no more than factual knowledge. If after that 
those people truly revere them they go on from being factual knowledge to become the truths of the Church. When however they have an affection for those truths and lead lives in keeping with them, 
they become spiritual truths; for the good of love and charity, which has its origin solely in the spiritual world, then enters in and brings life to them. For having an affection for them and leading 
a life in keeping with them stem from that good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What truths, called the truths of faith, are like with those who lead lives in keeping with them, and with those who do not, has been shown to 
me. With people who do not lead lives in keeping with them those truths have manifested themselves as white threads; and with people who knew those truths yet did nothing good at all they were fragile 
ones. But with people who do lead lives in keeping with them those truths have manifested themselves as fibres extending from the brain, which were filled with spirituous fluid and were soft. Thus these 
latter truths had life in them, the former did not. From all this one may recognize that the nature of the truths present with people depends on the individual's state of life. The truths which 'the 
sons of Jacob' represent are not as yet spiritual truths because they have not as yet been made matters of life. But the truths represented by those men as 'the sons of Israel' are spiritual ones 
because, having been made matters of life, the good of love and charity has entered them. Such truths are meant here because now the subject is the initial stage in the joining of the truths within the 
natural, which are 'the sons of Jacob', to internal good, which is 'Joseph', through the intermediary, which is 'Benjamin', and also through spiritual good, which is 'Israel'. </p>

`Et fecerunt ita filii Israelis': quod significet effectum a veris spiritualibus in naturali, constat a significatione `fecerunt' quod sit effectus; et a repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint 
vera spiritualia in naturali, de qua n. 5414, 5879. Quid vera spiritualia in naturali, dicendum: vera fidei extra hominem, spiritum et angelum non sunt vera fidei, non enim applicata sunt alicui subjecto 
in quo {1}fiunt; cum autem applicantur homini, spiritui et angelo ut subjecto, tunc fiunt vera fidei sed cum differentia secundum status vitae cujusvis; apud eos qui primum addiscunt illa, sunt 
modo scientifica; postea si {2}illi sancte {3}venerantur illa, ultra vadunt et fiunt vera Ecclesiae; cum autem {3}afficiuntur illis et secundum illa {3}vivunt, tunc fiunt vera spiritualia; bonum enim 
amoris et charitatis quod unice est ex spirituali mundo, tunc imbuit illa et facit ut vivant; nam affici illis et vivere secundum illa est ex illo bono. [2] Qualia sunt vera quae fidei vocantur, apud 
illos qui vivunt secundum illa et qui non vivunt, mihi ostensum est; apud illos qui non vivunt secundum illa, apparuerunt sicut filamenta alba{4}, et apud quos {5}vera illa fuerunt at nihil boni, fragilia; 
at apud illos qui vivunt secundum illa, apparuerunt sicut fibrae e cerebro impletae spiritu, et molles; ita fuerunt haec vera animata, illa autem inanimata; ex quibus sciri potest quod vera apud 
homines se habeant secundum statum vitae cujusvis. Vera quae per `filios Jacobi' repraesentantur, sunt vera nondum spiritualia quia nondum facta vitae; at vera quae per illos ut `filios Israelis' repraesentantur, 
sunt spiritualia, quia ex eo quod facta vitae, bono amoris et charitatis {6}imbuta sunt; haec vera hic intelliguntur quia nunc actum est de initiatione ad conjunctionem verorum in naturali 
quae sunt `filii Jacobi', cum bono interno quod est' `Joseph', per medium quod `Benjamin', et quoque per bonum spirituale quod `Israel'. @1 A alters fiunt to fiant$ @2 homo$ @3 singular$ @4 i
