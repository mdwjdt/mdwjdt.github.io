<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10430节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10430</strong>.“你且由着我”表他们不可如此顽固坚持。这从“由着”的含义清楚可知，当由耶和华指着这个民族来说的，“由着”是指他们不可如此顽固坚持。因为这个民族不是主所拣选的，而是由于它的顽固坚持而被主接纳的（参看<a href="4290.htm">4290</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="7051.htm">7051</a>，<a href="7439.htm">7439</a>节）。事实上，这个民族比全世界所有其它民族都更能禁食、俯伏在地、滚在灰尘中、整日哀叹，直到得到他们想要的东西才罢休。但他们如此坚持完全是为了他们自己，也就是说，因为他们被最炽烈的自我之爱和尘世之爱激动，不是为了神的东西。像这样的人只要遵守其外在形式上的律例和律法，的确蒙垂听；然而，他们不接受天堂和教会的任何事物在自己里面，只接受诸如属于世界的那类事物。这就是为何在来世，除了一些处于良善的人和他们的小孩子之外，他们都在地狱里的人之列。由此明显可知，“你且由着我”表示他们不可如此顽固坚持。</p>

And thou, suffer Me. That this signifies that there should not be so stubborn an insistence, is evident from the signification of "to suffer," when said by Jehovah of that nation, as being that there 
should not be so stubborn an insistence; for that nation was not chosen by the Lord, but was accepted because of its stubborn insistence (see n. 4290, 4293, 7051, 7439). For that nation, more than all 
other nations in the whole world, could practice fasting, lie on the ground, roll themselves in ashes, and be in mourning for whole days together, and not desist till they obtained what they wanted. 
But this insistence was solely for their own sake, namely, from a most ardent love of self and of the world, and not for the sake of the Divine. They who are such are indeed heard, and yet they do not 
receive into themselves anything of heaven and the church; but only such things as are of the world, provided they persevere in the statutes and laws in their outward form. From this it is that in the 
other life they are among the infernals, except some who have been in good, and except their little children. From this it is evident that by "thou suffer Me" is signified that there should not be 
so stubborn an insistence. </p>

'And you, let Me alone' means that they should not be so stubbornly insistent. This is clear from the meaning of 'letting alone', when said by Jehovah regarding that nation, as that they should not be 
so stubbornly insistent. For that nation was not chosen by the Lord but accepted by Him because they stubbornly insisted on it, see <a href="4290.htm">4290</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="7051.htm">7051</a>, <a href="7439.htm">7439</a>. For that nation more than all others throughout 
the whole world was capable of fasting, prostrating themselves, rolling in ashes, and lamenting for days on end, and of not leaving off till they got what they wanted. But they behaved in that stubborn 
way solely for the sake of themselves, that is to say, because they were inflamed by the most fiery self-love and love of the world, and not for the sake of what was God's. People who go on like 
this are indeed heard; but even so they do not receive anything of heaven and the Church within themselves, only such things as belong to the world, provided that they adhere to statutes and laws in 
the outward form they take. This is why in the next life they are among those in hell, except for some who have been governed by what is good, and except for their young children. From all this it is 
evident that 'you, let Me alone' means that they should not be so stubbornly insistent.

`Et tu, sine Mihi': quod significet quod non tam contumaciter insistendum sit, constat ex significatione `sinere' cum a Jehovah de gente illa, quod sit quod non (d)tam contumaciter insistendum; gens 
enim illa non a Domino electa fuit sed recepta, quia contumaciter institerat, videatur n. 4290,4293,7051,7439; gens enim illa prae omnibus aliis gentibus in universo terrarum orbe {1}potuit in jejunio 
esse, jacere super terra, volvere se in cinere, inque luctu esse, per integros dies, nec desistere antequam obtinerent; sed {2}contumacia illa fuit solum propter se, (x)nempe ex ardentissimo amore sui 
et mundi, et non propter Divinum; qui tales sunt, quidem audiuntur, sed usque non {3}aliquod caeli et Ecclesiae in se recipiunt, verum solum talia quae mundi sunt, si permanent in statutis et legibus 
in forma externa; {5}inde est quod illi in altera vita inter infernales sint, praeter aliquos qui in bono fuerunt, et praeter infantes eorum; inde patet quod per `tu, sine Mihi' significetur quod {6}non 
tam contumaciter insistendum sit. @1 talis fuerat, ut potuisset$ @2 ardor ille$ @3 aliquid$ @4 i quoniam id recipere non possunt$ @5 quae causa$ @6 After contumaciter$ </p>
