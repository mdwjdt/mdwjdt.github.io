Verses 19-23. And she arose, and went, and put off her veil from upon her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his companion the Adullamite, to 
receive the pledge from the woman's hand; and he found her not. And he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot that was at the fountains upon the way? And they said, There was no harlot 
there. And he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There was no harlot there. And Judah said, Let her take it to her; haply we be put to shame; behold 
I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. "And she arose," signifies elevation; "and went," signifies life; "and put off her veil from upon her," signifies that what was obscure was dissipated; 
"and put on the garments of her widowhood," signifies intelligence; "and Judah sent the kid of the goats," signifies a marriage pledge; "by the hand of his companion the Adullamite," signifies by falsity; 
"to receive the pledge from the woman's hand," signifies in the place of external pledges; "but he found her not," signifies because there was not anything conjugial on his part; "and he asked 
the men of that place, saying," signifies that truths were consulted; "Where is the harlot?" signifies whether it was falsity; "that was at the fountains upon the way," signifies that it appeared as 
truth; "and they said," signifies perception from truths; "There was no harlot there," signifies that it was not falsity; "and he returned to Judah," signifies reflection; "and said, I have not found 
her," signifies that this cannot be disclosed by falsity; "and also the men of the place said, There was no harlot there," signifies perception from truths that it was not falsity; "and Judah said, Let 
her take it to her," signifies that it was indifferent to him; "haply we be put to shame," signifies although it was a disgrace; "behold I sent this kid," signifies that it is enough that there is a 
pledge; "and thou hast not found her," signifies if there is not anything conjugial. </p>

Verses 19-23 And she rose up and went, and took off her veil from upon her and put on the clothes of her widowhood. And Judah sent the kid of the she-goats by the hand of his companion the Adullamite, 
to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; and he did not find her. And he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the harlot in the fountains on the wayside? And they said, There has been no 
harlot there. And he returned to Judah and said, I did not find her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no harlot there. And Judah said, Let her keep [them]; maybe we shall be put to 
shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and you did not find her. </p>
<p>'She rose up' means a raising up. 'And went' means life. 'And took off her veil from upon her' means the obscurity. 'And put on the clothes 
of her widowhood' means intelligence. 'And Judah sent the kid of the she-goats' means a conjugial pledge. 'By the hand of his companion the Adullamite' means by means of falsity. 'To receive the pledge 
from the woman's hand' means instead of external pledges. 'And he did not find her' means because nothing of marriage existed on his side. 'And he asked the men of her place, saying' means that truths 
were consulted. 'Where is the harlot?' means as to whether it was something false. 'In the fountains on the wayside' means that had the appearance of being something true. 'And they said' means perception 
received from truths. 'There has been no harlot there' means that it was not something false. 'And he resumed to Judah' means reflection. 'And said, I did not find her' means that by falsity 
this cannot be discovered. 'And also the men of the place said, There has been no harlot there' means perception received from truths that it was not something false. 'And Judah said, Let her keep [them]' 
means that he was no longer interested 'Maybe we shall be put to shame' means even though subject to reproach. 'Behold, I sent this kid' means it is enough that a pledge exists. 'And you did not 
find her' means even if nothing of marriage exists. </p>

Vers. 19-23.  Et surrexit, et ivit, et removit peplum suum a super se, et induit vestes viduitatis suae. Et misit Jehudah haedum caprarum in manu socii sui Adullamitae, ad accipiendum arrhabonem 
e manu mulieris, et non invenit illam. Et interrogavit viros loci illius, dicendo, Ubi scortum illud in fontibus super via? et dixerunt, Non fuit ibi scortum. Et reversus ad Jehudam, et dixit, Non 
inveni illam, et etiam viri loci dixerunt, Non fuit ibi scortum. Et dixit Jehudah, Accipiat sibi, forte erimus contemptui, ecce misi haedum hunc, et tu non invenisti illam.  `Surrexit' significat elevationem: 
`et ivit' significat vitam: `et removit peplum suum a super se' significat quod obscurum: `et induit vestes viduitatis suae' significat intelligentiam: `et misit Jehudah haedum caprarum' 
significat pignus conjugiale: `in manu socii sui Adullamitae' significat per falsum: `ad accipiendum arrhabonem e manu mulieris' significat loco pignorum externorum: </p>
<p>`et non invenit illam' significat 
quia non erat conjugiale a parte illius: `et interrogavit viros loci illius, dicendo' significat quod consulerentur vera: `Ubi scortum illud?' significat num falsum: `in fontibus super via' significat 
quod apparuit sicut verum: `et dixerunt' significat perceptionem a veris: `Non fuit ibi scortum' significat quod non falsum: 'et reversus as Jehudam'  significat reflexionem: `et dixit, Non 
inveni illam' significat quod a falso detegi hoc nequeat: `et etiam viri loci dixerunt, Non fuit ibi scortum' significat perceptionem a veris quod non falsum: </p>
<p>`et dixit Jehudah, Accipiat sibi' significat 
quod illi indifferens esset: `forte erimus contemptui' significat tametsi id opprobrio: </p>
<p>`ecce misi haedum hunc' significat satis esse quod sit pignus: `et tu non invenisti illam' significat 
si non sit conjugiale. </p>
