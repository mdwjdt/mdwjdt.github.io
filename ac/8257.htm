<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8257.</strong>敬拜主主要通过生活，这种生活是指与祂在圣言中的诫命相一致的生活，因为一个人能通过它们知道何为仁，何为信。这种生活才是基督徒的生活，并被称为属灵的生活。但是，没有这种生活，只是符合正义和高尚的法律的生活是文明、道德生活。这种生活能使一个人成为一个世界公民，但那种生活使一个人成为一个天堂公民。</p>

By the life through which the Lord is chiefly worshiped, is meant a life according to His injunctions in the Word, for by these man is acquainted with what faith is and what charity is: this life is 
the Christian life, and is called spiritual life. But a life according to the laws of what is just and honorable, without that life, is a civil and a moral life: this life makes a man to be a citizen 
of the world; but the other to be a citizen of heaven.            EXODUS 15 </p>
<p>     1. Then sang Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Jehovah, and they said, saying, I will sing to Jehovah because 
exalting He hath exalted; the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea.      2. My strength and song is Jah, and He hath been my salvation; this is my God, and I will prepare Him a habitation; 
my father's God, and I will exalt Him.      3. Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah is His name.      4. Pharaoh's chariots and his army He hath cast into the sea: and the choice of the tertian captains 
are sunk in the sea Suph.      5. The abysses have covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone.      6. Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is magnified in strength; with Thy right hand, O 
Jehovah, Thou breakest in pieces the enemy.      7. And in the multitude of Thine excellency Thou destroyest those who are rising up against Thee; Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it devoureth them as stubble.  
    8. And with the wind of Thy nostrils the waters were heaped up, the floods stood as a heap; the abysses were congealed in the heart of the sea.      9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I 
will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be filled with them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall drive them out.      10. Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sought 
the deep like lead in the vast waters.      11. Who is like Thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like Thee, magnificent in holiness, to be revered with praises, doing what is wonderful?      12. 
Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.      13. In Thy mercy Thou hast led the people that Thou hast redeemed; Thou hast conducted them in Thy strength to the habitation of 
Thy holiness.      14. The peoples have heard, they have trembled; pain hath laid hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.      15. Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; the mighty ones of Moab, terror 
hath laid hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted.      16. Fright and dread are fallen upon them; in the greatness of Thine arm they shall be destroyed as a stone, until Thy people 
shall pass over, O Jehovah, until shall pass over this people which Thou hast taken possession of.      17. Thou shalt bring them in, Thou shalt plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, in the 
place Thou hast wrought for Thee to dwell, O Jehovah, the sanctuary, O Lord, Thy hands have prepared.      18. Jehovah shall reign forever and to eternity.      19. Because the horse of Pharaoh came 
with his chariot and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; and the sons of Israel went on the dry through the midst of the sea.      20. And Miriam 
the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.      21. And Miriam answered to them, Sing ye to Jehovah, because 
exalting He hath exalted; the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea.      22. And Moses made Israel set out from the sea Suph, and they went out to the wilderness of Shur; and they went three 
days in the wilderness, and found no waters.      23. And they came to Marah, and they could not drink the waters for bitterness, because they were bitter; therefore he called the name thereof Marah.  
    24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?      25. And he cried unto Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a piece of wood, and he cast it to the waters, and the waters 
were made sweet. There He set for him a statute and a judgment, and there He tempted him; </p>
<p>     26. And He said, If hearing thou wilt hear the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do what is right 
in His eyes, and wilt hearken to His commandments, and wilt keep all His statutes, all the diseases that I have put on the Egyptians, I will not put upon thee, because I am Jehovah thy healer.      
27. And they came to Elim, and there were twelve springs of waters there, and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters. </p>

By the life through which the Lord is chiefly worshipped one should understand a life in keeping with His commandments contained in the Word, since a person can know through them what faith is and what 
charity is. This life is the Christian life, and it is called spiritual life. But a life in keeping with the laws of what is correct and honourable without that other life is civil and moral life. 
This life enables a person to be a citizen of the world, but the other enables him to be a citizen of heaven. </p>

Per vitam per quam principaliter colitur Dominus, intelligitur vita secundum praecepta Ipsius in Verbo, per haec enim novit homo quid fides et quid charitas; haec vita est vita Christiana, et vocatur 
vita spiritualis; vita autem secundum leges justi et honesti absque illa est vita civilis et moralis; haec vita facit ut homo sit civis mundi, illa autem ut sit civis caeli. CAPUT XV 	1.  Tunc cecinit 
Moscheh et filii Israelis canticum hoc JEHOVAE, et dixerunt dicendo, (x)Cantabo JEHOVAE, quia exaltando exaltavit; equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare. 	2.  Virtus mea, et canticum JAH {1}, et 
fuit mihi ad salutem; Hic DEUS meus, et habitaculum constituam Illi, DEUS patris mei, et exaltabo Ipsum. 	@1 i (Ps. cxviii 14)$ 	3.  JEHOVAH vir belli, JEHOVAH nomen Ipsius. 	4.  Currus Pharaonis 
et exercitum illius projecit in mare; et electio ducum tertianorum submersi in mari Suph. 	5.  Abyssi obtexerunt illos, descenderunt in profunditates sicut lapis. 	6.  Dextra Tua, JEHOVAH, magnificata 
in robore; dextra Tua, JEHOVAH, confringis hostem. 	7.  Et in multitudine excellentiae Tuae destruis insurgentes Tibi; emittis excandescentiam Tuam, comedit illos sicut stipulam. 	8.  Et vento narium 
Tuarum coacervatae sunt aquae, constiterunt sicut cumulus fluenta, {1}coagulatae abyssi in corde maris. 	@1 congelatae I$ 	9.  Dixit hostis, Persequar, assequar, dividam spolium, implebitur illis 
anima mea, evacuabo gladium meum, expellet illos manus mea. 	10.  Spirasti vento Tuo, {1}contexit illos mare, profundum petierunt sicut plumbum in aquis ingentibus. 	@1 contegit I$ 	11.  Quis sicut 
Tu in diis, JEHOVAH? quis sicut Tu, magnificus in sanctitate, venerandus laudibus, faciens mirabile? 	12.  Extendisti dextram Tuam, absorpsit illos terra. 	13.  Duxisti in misericordia Tua populum 
illum, redemisti; deduxisti in virtute Tua ad habitaculum sanctitatis Tuae. 	14.  Audiverunt populi, contremuerunt, dolor {1} apprehendit habitatores Philisthaeae. 	@1 i (qualis parturientii)$ 	15. 
 Tunc consternati sunt duces {1}Edomi, potentes Moabi, apprehendit illos terror; colliquefacti omnes habitatores Canaanis. 	@1 Edom I$ 	16.  Cecidit super illos formido et pavor; in magnitudine 
brachii Tui exscinduntur sicut lapis, usque dum transibit populus Tuus, JEHOVAH, usque dum transibit populus (x)hic, possedisti. 	17.  Introduces illos, {1} plantabis illos in monte hereditatis Tuae,

suo et in equitibus suis in mare, et reduxit JEHOVAH super illos aquas maris; et filii Israelis iverunt in arido per medium maris. 	20.  Et sumpsit Mirjam prophetissa, soror (x)Aharonis, tympanum 
in manu sua; et exiverunt omnes mulieres post illam in tympanis et in choreis. 	21.  Et respondit illis Mirjam, Cantate JEHOVAE, quia exaltando exaltavit; equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare. 	22. 
 Et proficisci fecit Moscheh Israelem a mari Suph, et exiverunt ad desertum Schur, et iverunt tres dies in deserto, et non invenerunt aquas. 	23.  Et venerunt ad Marah, et non potuerunt bibere aquas 
prae amaritudine, quia amarae illae; propterea vocavit nomen ejus Marah. 	24.  Et murmuraverint populus contra Moschen, dicendo, Quid bibemus? 	25.  Et clamavit ad JEHOVAM, et monstravit illi JEHOVAH 
lignum, et projecit ad aquas, et dulces factae aquae; ibi posuit illi statutum et judicium, et ibi tentavit illum. 	26.  Et dixit, Si audiendo audiveris vocem JEHOVAE DEI tui, et rectum in oculis 
Ipsius feceris, et auscultaveris praeceptis Ipsius, et custodiveris omnia statuta Ipsius, omnem morbum quem posui in Aegyptios, non ponam super te, quia Ego JEHOVAH sanator tuus. 	27.  Et venerunt ad 
Elim, et ibi duodecim fontes aquarum, et septuaginta palmae; et castrametati sunt ibi juxta aquas. </p>
