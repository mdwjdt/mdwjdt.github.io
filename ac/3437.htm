<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3437.</strong>创世记26:24，25.当夜耶和华向他显现，说，我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的神，不要惧怕！因为我与你同在，要赐福给你，并要为我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故，使你的种繁多。以撒就在那里筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名，又在那里支搭帐棚。他的仆人便在那里挖了一口井。<br />“当夜耶和华向他显现，说”表主对于这模糊的直觉。“我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的神，不要惧怕！因为我与你同在”表神性也在那里（即在圣言字义中）。“要赐福给你，使你的种繁多”表良善与真理由此增长。“并要为我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故”表由于主的神性人。“以撒就在那里筑了一座坛”表主的有意义的符号和代表。“求告耶和华的名”表由此而来的敬拜。“又在那里支搭帐棚”表它所含有的圣洁。“他的仆人便在那里挖了一口井”表出自那里的教义。</p>

Verses 24, 25. And Jehovah appeared to him in that night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and will multiply thy seed, for the sake of 
Abraham My servant. And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there, and there the servants of Isaac digged out a well. "And Jehovah appeared to him in 
that night, and said," signifies the Lord's perception concerning that obscurity; "I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee," signifies that the Divine also was there; "and I 
will bless thee, and will multiply thy seed," signifies that thence would be increase of good and truth; "for the sake of Abraham My servant," signifies from the Lord's Divine Human; "and he builded an 
altar there," signifies a significative and representative of the Lord; "and called upon the name of Jehovah," signifies worship thence; "and pitched his tent there," signifies what is holy therein; 
"and there the servants of Isaac digged out a well," signifies doctrine thence derived. </p>

Verses 24, 25 And Jehovah appeared to him that night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father; do not fear, for I am with you; and I will bless you, and will cause your seed to multiply, for the 
sake of Abraham My servant. And he built an alter there and called on the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And Isaac's servants dug a well there. </p>
<p>'Jehovah appeared to him that night, 
and said' means the Lord's perception regarding that obscurity. 'I am the God of Abraham your father; do not fear, for I am with you' means that the Divine also was present there [in the literal sense 
of the Word]. 'And I will bless you, and will cause your seed to multiply' means the increase of good and truth from there. 'For the sake of Abraham My servant' means because of the Lord's Divine Human. 
'And he built an altar there' means that which is a meaningful sign of the Lord and a representative of Him. 'And he called on the name of Jehovah' means the worship derived from there. 'And pitched 
his tent there' means the holiness contained in it. 'And Isaac's servants dug a well there' means the doctrine that came from there. </p>

Vers. 24, 25. Et apparuit ad eum Jehovah in nocte illa, et dixit, Ego Deus Abrahami patris tui, ne timeas, quia cum te Ego, et benedicam tibi, et multiplicari faciam semen tuum, propter Abrahamum servum 
Meum. Et aedificabat ibi altare, et invocavit nomen Jehovae, et tetendit ibi tentorium suum, et perfoderunt ibi servi Jishaki puteum. `Apparuit ad eum Jehovah in nocte illa, et dixit' significat perceptionem 
Domini de obscuro illo: `Ego Deus Abrahami patris tui, ne timeas, quia cum te Ego' significat quod Divinum etiam esset ibi: `et benedicam tibi, et multiplicari faciam semen tuum' significat 
quod inde incrementum boni et veri: `propter Abrahamum servum Meum' significat ex Divino Humano Domini: `et aedificabat ibi altare' significat significativum et repraesentativum Domini:  `et invocavit 
nomen Jehovae' significat cultum inde: `et tetendit ibi tentorium suum' significat ibi sanctum: `et perfoderunt ibi servi Jishaki puteum' significat doctrinam inde. </p>
