Verses 16-20. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo he goeth forth unto the waters; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let My people go, that they 
may serve Me. For if thou let not My people go, behold I send against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and into thy houses, the noisome fly; and the houses of the Egyptians shall 
be filled with the noisome fly, and also the land whereon they are. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, upon which My people stands, that no noisome fly be there; to the end that thou 
mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the land. And I will set redemption between My people and thy people; unto the morrow shall this sign be. And Jehovah did so; and there came the grievous 
noisome fly into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; the land was destroyed from before the noisome fly. "And Jehovah said unto Moses" signifies instruction 
again; "Rise up early in the morning" signifies elevation to a still greater sign of power; "and stand before Pharaoh" signifies the appearance of the Divine to those who are in evils; "lo 
he goeth forth to the waters" signifies that from these evils they again think falsities; "and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah" signifies command; "Let My people go, that they may serve Me" signifies 
that they should leave those who are of the spiritual church in order that they may worship their God in freedom; "for if thou let not My people go" signifies if they would not release them; "behold 
I send against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and into thy houses, the noisome fly" signifies that they would have malevolent falsity in all things and in each; "and the houses 
of the Egyptians shall be filled with the noisome fly, and also the land whereon they are" signifies that the falsities of malevolence will take possession of all things of the natural mind; "and I 
will sever in that day the land of Goshen, upon which My people stands, that no noisome fly be there" signifies that they shall not be able to infest by falsities of malevolence those who are of the spiritual 
church, although they will be near them; "to the end that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the land" signifies a consequent noticing that the Lord is the only God of the church; 
"and I will set redemption between My people and thy people" signifies the liberation of those who are of the spiritual church from those who are near in the hells; "unto the morrow shall this sign 
be" signifies the manifestation of Divine power from this forever; "and Jehovah did so" signifies that as said, so it was done; "and there came the grievous noisome fly into the house of Pharaoh, and 
into the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt" signifies that malevolent falsities burst forth from all sides among them; "the land was destroyed from before the noisome fly" signifies 
that the natural mind was corrupted in respect to truth. </p>

Verses 1-20 And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up in the morning early to stand before Pharaoh; behold, he goes out to the water. And you are to say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Send My people away and let 
them serve Me. For if you do not send My people away, behold, I send onto you, and onto your servants, and onto your people, and into your houses, noxious flying insects; and the houses of the Egyptians 
will be full of the noxious flying insects, and also the land on which they are. And I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen, on which My people stand, so that the noxious flying insects 
are not there; to the end that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the land. And I will place redemption between My people and your people; by tomorrow will this sign be. And Jehovah did so; 
and extremely noxious flying insects came to the house of Pharaoh, and to the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was ruined by the presence of the noxious flying insects. </p>
<p>'And 
Jehovah said to Moses' means further instruction. 'Rise up in the morning early' means being raised to an even greater sign of power. 'To stand before Pharaoh' means the appearance of the Divine 
to those immersed in evils. 'Behold, he goes out to the water' means that they proceeded from those evils to contemplate further falsities. 'And you are to say to him, Thus says Jehovah' means a 
command. 'Send My people away and let them serve Me' means that they should leave those who belong to the spiritual Church, in order that these may worship their God in freedom. 'For if you do not send 
My people away' means should they fail to leave them ... 'Behold, I send onto you, and onto your servants, and onto your people, and into your houses, noxious flying insects' means that malevolent 
falsity will be present in every single aspect. 'And the houses of the Egyptians will be full of the noxious flying insects, and also the land on which they are' means that malevolent falsities will take 
possession of everything in the natural mind. 'And I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen, on which My people stand, so that the noxious flying insects are not there' means that they will 
not be able to use malevolent falsities to molest those who belong to the spiritual Church even though they are near them. 'To the end that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the land' means 
the resulting discernment that the Lord is the only God of the Church. 'And I will place redemption between My people and your people' means the deliverance of those who belong to the spiritual Church 
from those in the hells nearby. 'And tomorrow will this sign be' means the manifestation of Divine power thereby for evermore. 'And Jehovah did so' means as it had been declared, so it was done. 
'And extremely noxious flying insects came to the house of Pharaoh, and to the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt' means that malevolent falsities burst out from every side among them. 
'And the land was ruined by the presence of the noxious flying insects' means that [all] truth in the natural mind was corrupted. </p>

Vers. 16-20.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Surge mane in matutino, et consistas coram Pharaone, ecce egreditur ad aquas, et dicas ad illum, Ita dicit Jehovah, Mitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi.  
Quia si haud tu dimittis populum Meum, ecce Ego immitto in te, et in servos tuos, et in populum tuum, et in domos tuas, volatile noxium; et implebuntur domus Aegyptiorum volatili noxio, et etiam terra 
super qua illa.  Et distinguam in die illo terram Goschen, super qua populus Meus stat, ut non esse ibi volatile noxium, propterea ut scias quod Ego Jehovah in medio terrae.  Et ponam redemptionem inter 
populum Meum et inter populum tuum; ad cras erit signum hoc.  Et fecit Jehovah ita, et venit volatile noxium grave domum Pharaonis, et domum servorum illius, et in omnem terram Aegypti; perdebatur 
terra a coram volatili noxio.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat iterum instructionem: `Surge mane in matutino' significat elevationem ad potentiae signum adhuc majus: `et consistas coram Pharaone' 
significat apparentiam Divini illis qui in malis: `ecce egreditur ad aquas' significat quod ex malis illis iterum cogitent falsa: `et dicas ad illum, Ita dicit Jehovah' significat mandatum: `Mitte 
populum Meum, {1}et serviant Mihi significat ut relinquant qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, ut colant Deum suum in libero: `quia si haud tu dimittis populum Meum' significat si non relinquerent: `ecce Ego 
immitto in te, et in servos tuos, et in populum tuum, et in domos tuas, volatile noxium' significat quod illis falsum malevolum in omnibus et singulis: `et implebuntur domus Aegyptiorum volatili noxio, 
et etiam terra super qua illa' significat quod falsa malevolentiae occupabunt omnia mentis naturalis: `et distinguam in die illo terram Goschen, super qua populus Meus stat, ut non esse ibi volatile 
noxium' significat quod non infestare poterunt per falsa malevolentiae illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, tamtesi prope illos {2}sunt: `propterea ut scias quod Ego Jehovah in medio terrae' significat 
apperceptionem inde, quod Dominus solus Deus Ecclesiae: `et ponam redemptionem inter populum Meum et inter populum tuum' significat liberationem illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali ab illis qui in infernis 
prope: `et cras erit signum hoc' significat manifestationem potentiae Divinae inde in perpetuum: `et fecit Jehovah ita' significat ut dictum ita factum: `et venit volatile noxium grave domum Pharaonis, 
et domum servorum illius, et in omnem terram Aegypti' significat quod falsa malevola ex undique apud illos erumperent: `et perdebatur terra a coram volatili noxio' significat quod corrumperetur 
mens naturalis quoad verum. 	@1 ut I cp n. 7439$ 	@2 erunt I$ </p>
