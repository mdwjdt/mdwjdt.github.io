<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5253节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5253.</strong>“没有人能解”表对它里面所包含之物的无知。这从“解”的含义清楚可知，“解”是指某种事物里面所包含的东西（<a href="5093.htm">5093</a>，<a href="5105.htm">5105</a>，<a href="5107.htm">5107</a>，<a href="5141.htm">5141</a>节），因此“没有人能解”是指对它里面包含之物的无知。就内义而言，“没有人”并非表示没有人或无人，而是表示纯粹的缺乏或不存在，在此简单地表示不，因而表示某种不为人知的东西，或对它的无知。原因在于，人在内义中并不关注任何具体的人，甚至不关注与任何人有关的任何事物（<a href="5225.htm">5225</a>节）；“没有人”或“无人”这个词只是暗示了一个人的某个总体方面。当圣言的字义变成内义时，从字义消失的元素一般有三种，即时间元素，空间元素和人的元素。原因是，灵界既没有时间，也没有空间，这两种元素属于自然界；因此，当论到那些死亡的人时，就说他们从时间消失，把属于时间的一切都抛在了身后。在灵界，他们之所以不关注与某个人有关的任何事物，是因为在交谈时，专注于某个具体人会缩小并限制观念，而不是拓宽观念，除去对它的限制。交谈时，观念的拓宽和限制的缺乏使得天使的语言具有普遍性，构成并能表达无数难以形容的奇妙观念。因此，天使的语言就具有这种性质；尤其属天天使的语言，相对于其他人所用的语言，他们的语言没有任何局限性。正因如此，他们的全部言语能流入无限之物和永恒之物，因而流入主的神性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5253</b></p><p><b>5253.</b>
And no one interpreteth it. That this signifies ignorance of what was therein, is evident from the signification of "interpreting" as being what was therein (n. 5093, 5105, 5107, 5141); hence ignorance 
of what was therein is signified by "no one interpreteth it." In the internal sense by "no one" is not meant no one or none, the expression being merely negative; and here simply not, thus that it 
is not known, or that there is ignorance regarding it. The reason is, that in the internal sense no person, nor even anything determined to a person, is regarded (n. 5225); and in the expression "no one," 
or none, something of person in general is implied. There are three things in general that perish from the literal sense of the Word when it becomes the internal sense, namely, what is of time, what 
is of space, and what is of person. The reason is that in the spiritual world there is neither time nor space, these two belonging to nature; and therefore it is said of those who die, that they pass 
out of time, and leave behind all that is of time. That in the spiritual world nothing is regarded as determined to person is because directing the attention in speech to person narrows and limits 
the idea, instead of extending it and making it unlimited. Extension and absence of limitation in speech cause it to be universal, and to comprise and be able to express innumerable and also ineffable 
things. Hence the speech of the angels is of this character, especially the speech of the celestial angels, which is relatively unlimited; and in consequence everything of their speech flows into the 
infinite and the eternal, consequently into the Divine of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5253</b></p><p><b>5253.</b>
'And there is no one who can interpret it' means ignorance about what it held within it. This is clear from the meaning of 'interpreting' as what something held within it, dealt with in <a href="5093.htm">5093</a>, <a href="5105.htm">5105</a>, <a href="5107.htm">5107</a>, <a href="5141.htm">5141</a> - ignorance about what it held within it therefore being meant by 'no one who can interpret it'. In the internal sense 'no one' does not mean no one or nobody, but simply absence or non-existence. 
Here therefore that which is 'not' is meant, thus something that is unknown to people or of which they are ignorant. The explanation for this is that one does not see in the internal sense any 
particular person, or indeed anything that has to do specifically with any person, see <a href="5225.htm">5225</a>; and by the expression 'no one' or nobody' no more than some general aspect of a person is implied. </p>

 There 
are in general three elements which depart from the literal sense of the Word when it becomes the internal sense; these are the temporal, the spatial, and the personal. The reason for this is that 
neither time nor space exists in the spiritual world. These two elements belong properly to the natural order, which also accounts for its being said that those who die depart from the realm of time, 
leaving temporal concerns behind them. And the reason why in the spiritual world they do not see anything that has to do specifically with some person is that any focusing, when they speak, on some 
particular person narrows down and limits the idea they have in mind; such a focusing prevents any broadening or removal of limits to their idea. Their use, when they speak, of broadened and unlimited 
ideas renders their language universal, a language that includes and enables them to express countless and also wondrous ideas. This is what the language used by angels is like, especially that used 
by celestial angels, which, compared with that employed by others, knows no limitations. This being so, the whole of their speech reaches into what is infinite and into what is eternal, consequently into 
the Divine of the Lord. </p>

</p><b>5253.</b>
`Et interpretans nemo illud': quod significet ignorationem quid inesset, constat ex significatione `interpretari' quod sit quid inesset, de qua n. 5093, 5105, 5107, 5141, inde ignoratio quid inesset, 
significatur per quod `nemo interpretans illud'. `Nemo' in sensu interno non est nemo aut nullus sed est mere negativum, hic ideo `non', ita quod non sciatur seu quod ignoretur; causa est quia in sensu 
interno non aliqua persona, et ne quidem aliquid determinatum ad personam, spectatur, videatur n. 5225, et in voce `nemo' aut `nullus' aliquid personae in communi involvitur; sunt tria in genere quae 
ex sensu litterae Verbi pereunt dum fit sensus internus, nempe id quod est temporis, id quod est spatii, et id quod est personae; [2] causa est quia in mundo spirituali non est tempus, nec est spatium, 
haec bina {1}sunt propria naturae, quapropter etiam de morientibus dicitur quod e tempore excedant, et quod relinquant illa quae temporis sunt; quod in mundo spirituali non spectatur aliquid {2}determinatum 
ad personam, est causa quia intuitio personae in loquela contrahit ideam et limitat, non autem extendit et illimitatam reddit; extensum et illimitatum in loquela facit {3}quod universalis 
sit, et {4}quod innumerabilia et quoque ineffabilia comprehendat et exprimere possit; loquela angelorum inde talis est, imprimis loquela angelorum caelestium quae (t)est illimitata respective; inde omne 
sermonis eorum influit in infinitum et in aeternum, consequenter in Divinum Domini. @1 enim propria naturae sunt$ @2 personae, causa est$ @3 universalis ejus$ @4 i consequenter$ </p>
