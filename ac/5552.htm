Continuation concerning the correspondence with the Grand Man; here concerning the correspondence of the skin, the hair, and the bones therewith.	 In regard to correspondence the case is this. The things 
in man which have the most life correspond to those societies in the heavens which have the most life and hence the most happiness there, as do those to which man's external and internal sensories 
correspond, and the things of his understanding and will. But the things in man which have less life correspond to such societies there as are in less life, as the cuticles which invest the whole body, 
the cartilages and bones which support and hold together all the parts of the body, and also the hairs which grow out from the cuticles. What the societies are to which these correspond, and what 
is their quality, is also to be told. </p>

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN - continued IN THIS SECTION THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SKIN, HAIR, AND BONES WITH IT </p>
<p>Correspondence is by nature such that the parts in the human being which possess 
the greatest amount of life correspond to those communities in heaven which possess the greatest amount of life and consequently the greatest amount of happiness there, such as those communities to 
which a person's external and internal sensory powers correspond, and which have a link with his understanding and his will. But parts in the human being which possess less life correspond to the kinds 
of communities where less life is present, such as the layers of the skin which cover the whole body, also the cartilages and the bones which hold together and support everything within the body, 
as well as the hairs that grow out of the skin. The identity and nature of those communities to which all these parts of the body correspond must also be stated. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia cum Maximo Homine; hic de Correspondentia Cutis, Capillorum et Ossium cum illo </p>
<p> Cum correspondentia ita se habet: quae in homine maximam vitam habent, (c)ea correspondent 
illis societatibus in caelis quae maximam vitam et inde maximam felicitatem ibi habent, ut sunt illae quibus correspondent sensoria hominis externa et interna, et quae intellectus et voluntatis 
sunt; at quae in homine minorem vitam habent, ea correspondent talibus societatibus quae in minore ibi vita sunt, ut sunt cuticulae quae {1} ambiunt universum corpus, tum cartilagines et ossa qua fulciunt 
et sustentant omnia quae in corpore sunt; et quoque capilli qui ex cuticulis erumpunt; quaenam et quales societates sunt quibus illa et haec correspondent, etiam dicendum. @1 quod I$ </p>
