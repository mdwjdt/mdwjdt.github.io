<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6916节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6916.</strong>“各妇人必向她的邻舍，并居住在她家里的女人要”表每个人的良善都要富有诸如适合它、有帮助的那类事物。这从“妇人”、“她的邻舍”和“居住在她家里的女人”的含义清楚可知：“妇人”是指对仁之良善的一种情感（参看<a href="6014.htm">6014</a>节）；“她的邻舍”是指对存在于那些拥有记忆知识之人里面的真理的一种情感；“居住在她家里的女人”是指也存在于他们里面的良善的情感。由于她要向她的邻舍并居住在家里的女人要，故所表示的是离它最近，因而适合它、有帮助的真理与良善。至于此中是何情形，这从刚才的讨论（<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>节）明显可知。要去要的之所以是“妇人”，是因为“妇人”表示仁之良善，要富有的，是该良善；因为若要良善成为良善，就必须有赋予它具体品质的真理。原因在于，当人照真理生活时，实际的真理本身就会成为良善；这意味着真理的品质如何，良善就如何，或说真理所拥有的具体品质成为良善所拥有的。之后该良善只接受与自己的具体品质相一致的真理，并与它们联结，不接受并联结其它真理，因此除了适合它、有帮助的真理，因而在邻舍的区域和家里的那类真理外，不与其它任何真理联结。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6916</b></p><p><b>6916.</b>
But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house. That this signifies that the good of everyone will be enriched with such things as are helpful, is evident from the 
signification of "woman," as being the affection of the good of charity (see n. 6014); from the signification of "her neighbor," as being the affection of truth with those who are in memory-knowledges; 
and from the signification of "her that sojourneth in her house," as being the affection of good, which is also with them. As she was to ask of her neighbor and of her that sojourned in the house, 
there are signified the truths and goods which are nearest, thus which are helpful. How the case herein is, is plain from what was adduced just above (n. 6914); a "woman" was to ask because by "woman" 
is signified the good of charity, and this must be what is to be enriched; for in order that good may become good, there must be truths to qualify it. The reason is that when anyone lives according to 
truths, the truths themselves then become goods; and therefore such as is the quality of the truth, such becomes the good. This good afterward associates and adjoins to itself no other truths than such 
as are in accord with its own quality, consequently no other than such as are helpful, thus which are in the neighborhood and in the house. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6916</b></p><p><b>6916.</b>
'And let a woman ask of her female neighbour, and of the female guest in her house' means that everyone's good will be enriched with such things as are suited to it. This is clear from the meaning of 
'a woman as an affection for the good of charity, dealt with in <a href="6014.htm">6014</a>; from the meaning of 'female neighbour' as an affection for truth which is present in those who are in possession of factual knowledge; 
and from the meaning of 'the female guest in the house' as an affection for good which is also present in them. And because it was her female neighbour and the female guest in her house whom she 
was to ask, the truths and forms of good which are nearest to it and so suited to it are meant. The implications of all this are clear from the matters discussed just above in <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>. The reason why a 
woman had to do the asking is that 'a woman' means the good of charity, and this is what is to be enriched; for if good is to be good truths must be present to give it a particular quality. The reason 
for this is that when one leads a life in accordance with truths, the actual truths are made forms of good, which means that the particular quality which truth possesses becomes that which good possesses. 
After that this good receives and links to itself no truths other than those in keeping with its particular duality, consequently to none apart from those which are suited to it, thus are in the 
neighbouring area and in its house. </p>

</p><b>6916.</b>
`Et petat mulier e vicina sua, et ex hospita domus suae': quod significet quod bonum cujusvis locupletabitur talibus quae conducunt, constat ex significatione `mulieris' quod sit affectio boni charitatis, 
de qua n. 6014; ex significatione `vicinae' quod sit affectio veri quae illis qui in scientificis sunt; et ex significatione `hospitae domus' quod sit affectio boni quae etiam illis; quia `ex vicina 
et ex hospita domus {1}peteret' significantur vera et bona quae proxima sunt, ita quae conducunt.  Quomodo haec se habent, {2}constat {3}ex illis quae mox supra n. 6914 allata sunt; quod `mulier 
peteret,' est quia per `mulierem' significatur bonum charitatis, et hoc erit quod locupletabitur, nam bonum ut sit bonum, erunt vera quae qualificabunt; causa est quia, cum vivitur secundum vera, ipsa 
vera tunc fiunt bona; quapropter quale verum est, tale fit bonum; hoc bonum postea non alia vera adsciscit et sibi adjungit quam secundum quale suum, consequenter non alia quam quae conducunt, ita quae 
in vicinia sunt et in domo. 	@1 After vicina$ 	@2 constare potest$ 	@3 d ex in ab$ </p>
