<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>996.</strong>“可食的植物”表快乐的低级表现。这一点从前面所述清楚可知。这类快乐被称为“可食的植物”，是因为它们纯粹是世俗和肉体的，即外在的。如前所述，存在于肉体或最外在之物中的乐趣起源于有序排列的内在快乐。在最外在或肉体之物中所感受到的快乐相对低级。一切快乐的性质会随着它趋向外在事物而越来越低级，随着它趋向内在事物而越来越高尚。所以，如前所述，随着外在事物脱落或被剥去，快乐会变得越来越令人愉悦和高尚。这一点从以下事实清楚可知：在肉身生活期间，人的乐趣中所固有的快乐，相比肉身生活之后、当他进入精灵界之时的快乐，是较为低级的。事实上，它如此低级，以致善灵完全弃绝肉体的快乐。即便把全世界的所有快乐都赐给他们，他们也不会回来。<br />当这些精灵被主提升到天使灵天堂时，他们所享有的快乐同样变得低级。因为那时他们会抛弃这些内在快乐，融入到那些更为内在的快乐中。这同样适用于天使灵，当天使灵被主提升到天使天堂或第三层天堂时，他们在自己的天堂所享有的快乐也会变得低级。由于天使天堂的内在事物是活的，故那里只有彼此相爱，并且那里的幸福无法形容（关于内在的快乐或幸福，参看<a href="545.htm">545</a>节）。<br />由此明显可知“这一切我都赐给你们，如同可食的植物一样”所表之义。由于爬物既表肉体的乐趣，也表感官的乐趣，故在原文中，“可食的植物”所指的是既表“食用植物”，也表“绿色植物”之物，“食用植物”是指意愿的乐趣，即来自属天情感的乐趣，而“绿色植物”是指觉知的乐趣，即来自属灵情感的乐趣。“食用植物”和“绿色植物”表低级事物，这一点从圣言清楚可知，如以赛亚书：<br />因为宁林的都已荒凉，青草枯乾，嫩草灭没，青绿之物一无所有。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.6.htm">15:6</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />其居民软弱无力，他们惊惶羞愧；他们像田间的植物，像可食的青草，如房顶上的干草。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.27.htm">37:27</a>）<br />“可食的青草”表非常低级之物。摩西五经：<br />你要进去得为业的那陆地，本不像你出来的埃及陆地；你在那里撒种，用脚浇灌，像浇灌可食植物的菜园一样。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.10.htm">11:10</a>）<br />此处“可食植物的菜园”表低级之物。诗篇：<br />恶人如草快被割下，又如可食的植物快要毁灭。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗37.2.htm">37:2</a>）<br />此处“草”和“可食的植物”表非常低级之物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]996.</strong> The symbolism of a plant as the humblest kinds of pleasure is established by the statements above.<br />Those kinds of pleasure are called green plants because they are nothing more than worldly and physical kinds — superficial kinds. As I said, the pleasure we feel in our bodies, or on the surface of existence, traces its source back to increasingly deeper levels of enjoyment. The pleasures felt on the surface, or in one's body, are relatively inferior. All agreeable sensation is such that the shallower it grows, the poorer it is, while the deeper it grows, the more blissful it is. So to repeat, as the external layers are unwrapped or peeled off, the elation grows sweeter and more blissful. This is sufficiently apparent from the fact that our enjoyment of the lower pleasures during our physical lives is quite paltry compared to the sensations we enjoy afterward, when we enter the world of spirits. It is so inferior, in fact, that good spirits absolutely spurn the creature comforts of the body and would refuse to return to them even if given all the pleasure in the whole world.<br />[2] The pleasure these spirits enjoy in turn loses its luster when the Lord lifts them into the heaven of angelic spirits, because they then shed those deeper delights and don ones still deeper. The exhilaration that angelic spirits felt in their heaven likewise pales when the Lord raises them into the angelic or third heaven. In this heaven, where inner qualities are alive and mutual love reigns supreme, the happiness is indescribable. (For more on inner pleasure or happiness, see the account from experience in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_545" target=_top>545</a>.)<br />This shows the meaning of I have given it all to you as I gave you the green plants.<br />Since creeping things symbolize both personal pleasures and the pleasures of the senses, and these are being described as green plants, the original language has an expression that means both "plants" and "greenery."{*1} "Plants" refers to earthly pleasures stemming from matters of will, or from heavenly kinds of feelings, while "greenery" refers to those stemming from matters of understanding, or from spiritual feelings.<br />[3] The symbolism of green plants or grass as something lowly can be seen in the Word, as for instance in Isaiah:<br />The waters of Nimrim will be wastelands, because the grain has dried out, the grass has been consumed, there is no greenery. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_15_6" target=_top>Isaiah 15:6</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Their residents, their hand shortened, have felt panic and shame. They have become field grass and grain plants, hay on the roofs.{*2} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_37_27" target=_top>Isaiah 37:27</a>)<br />Grain plants stand for what is humblest. In Moses:<br />The land that you enter, to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt, which you came out from, where you would sow your seed and irrigate it by foot like a vegetable garden. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_11_10" target=_top>Deuteronomy 11:10</a>)<br />The vegetable garden stands for something humble. In David:<br />The evil are suddenly cut down like grain and are consumed like green plants. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/bible_king-james-version_psalms_37_2" target=_top>Psalms 37:2</a>)<br />The grain and the green plants stand for what is humblest.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Hebrew expression in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_3" target=_top>Genesis 9:3</a> here referred to is יֶרֶק‭ ‬עֵשֶׂב (yereq ‘ēśeḇ), which is composed of two nouns; the first means "greenery" and the second means "grass" or "herb." [LHC]<br />{*2} The "hay on the roofs" is the growth that arose from seeds mixed into the mud of which roofs were commonly made in Middle Eastern countries. Though it grew rapidly with the rains, it either dried up quickly in the ensuing sun or was deliberately burned off before it could attain its usual height. See The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (Orr and others 1960), under "grass;" compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996/bible_king-james-version_psalms_129_6" target=_top>Psalms 129:6</a>.

That the "esculent herb" signifies the vile things of delights is evident from what has been said. They are called the esculent herb because they are only worldly and corporeal, or external. For, as 
already said, the pleasures that are in the bodily or outermost things of man have their origin in delights that are successively more and more interior. The delights that are perceived in those outermost 
or bodily things are relatively vile, for it is the nature of all delight to become more vile in proportion as it progresses toward the externals, and more happy in proportion as it advances toward 
the internals. For this reason, as before said, in proportion as the externals are stripped off, or rolled away, the delights become more pleasant and happy, as may be evident enough from man's delight 
in pleasures being vile while he lives in the body, in comparison with his delight after the life of the body, when he comes into the world of spirits; so vile indeed that good spirits utterly spurn 
the delights of the body, nor would they return to them if all in the whole world should be given them.  [2] The delight of these spirits in like manner becomes vile when they are taken up by the 
Lord into the heaven of angelic spirits; for they then throw off these interior delights and enter into those that are still more interior. So again to angelic spirits the delight which they have had 
in their heaven becomes vile when they are taken up by the Lord into the angelic or third heaven, in which heaven, since internal things are there living, and there is nothing but mutual love, the happiness 
is unspeakable. (See what is said of interior delight or happiness above, n. 545.) From these things it is evident what is signified by "as the esculent herb have I given it all to you." Inasmuch 
as creeping things signify both pleasures of the body and pleasures of the senses, of which the esculent herb is predicated, the word in the original language is one which signifies both "esculent" 
and "green"-"esculent" in reference to pleasures of the will, or of celestial affections, and "green" in reference to pleasures of the understanding, or of spiritual affections.  [3] That the "esculent 
herb" and "green herb" signify what is vile, is evident in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is dried up, the herbage is consumed, there is no green 
thing (Isa. 15:6).      Their inhabitants were short of hand, they were dismayed, and put to shame; they became the herb of the field, and the green herbage, the grass on the house tops (Isa. 37:27), the 
"green herbage" denoting what is most vile. In Moses: </p>
<p>The land whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst 
it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs (Deut. 11:10), where a "garden of herbs" denotes what is vile. In David: </p>
<p>     The evil are as grass, suddenly are they cut down, and will be consumed as 
the green herbage (Ps. 37:2), where "grass" and the "green herbage" denote what is most vile. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 996</b></p><p><b>996.</b>
'The edible plant' means very lowly manifestations of delights. This becomes clear from what has been stated. Such delights are called 'edible plants' because they are merely worldly and bodily, that 
is, external. For, as stated, the pleasures that consist in bodily or most external things have their origins in interior delights ranged in order. Delights that are felt in the most external or bodily 
things are comparatively lowly. It is true of all delight that the more lowly it is the closer it gets to things that are external, while the nobler it is the closer it gets to those that are internal. 
Consequently, as has been stated, as in order the external things are rolled away or peeled off, the more pleasant and noble delights become, something which becomes quite clear from the fact that 
the delight inherent in someone's pleasures during his lifetime is lowly in comparison with the delight that is his subsequently when he enters the world of spirits. Indeed it is so lowly that good 
spirits reject with utter disdain the delights of the body. Nor do they wish to go back to them even if they were granted all the delights existing in the whole world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The delight which these spirits 
enjoy becomes similarly lowly when they are raised up by the Lord into the heaven of angelic spirits, for at that point they cast away those interior delights and take on others more interior still. 
The same applies to angelic spirits - the delight which these have enjoyed in their heaven likewise becomes a lowly delight when they are taken up by the Lord into the angelic or third heaven. Since 
internal things in that heaven are living, and nothing else but mutual love reigns, the happiness there is indescribable. For interior delight or happiness, see what has been told from experience 
in <a href="545.htm">545</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These considerations show what is meant by the statement 'as the edible plant I have given all this to you. Because creeping things mean both pleasures of the body and pleasures of the 
senses, to which 'edible plants' has reference, the expression in the original language is one that means both edible plant and green plant, 'edible plant' in reference to pleasures of the will, which 
are from celestial affections, and 'green plant' in reference to those of the understanding, which are from spiritual affections. That 'edible plants' and 'green plants' mean things that are lowly 
is clear from the Word, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The waters of Nimrim will be desolations, for the grass has withered away, the herb has been consumed, and there is no green plant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2015:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 15:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Their inhabitants were shorn of power,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they were dismayed and filled with shame; they became plants of the field and edible grass plants, hay on the rooftops. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Edible grass 
plants' stands for that which is very lowly. In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
The land, into which you are entering to take possession of it, is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come out; in it you may 
sow your seed and water it with your foot, like a garden of edible plants. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2011:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 11:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'garden of edible plants' stands for what is lowly. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The wicked are suddenly cut down like 
the grass, and destroyed like the edible plant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2037:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 37:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'grass' and 'edible plant' stand for what is very lowly.

Quod 'olus' significet vilia jucunditatum, constare potest ab illis quae dicta sunt: 'olus herbae' vocantur quia sunt modo mundana et corporea, seu externa; nam, ut dictum, voluptates quae in corporeis 
seu extremis sunt, originem trahunt a jucundis ordine interioribus; jucunda quae percipiuntur in extremis seu corporeis, respective vilia sunt; omne enim jucundum tale est ut vilius sit quo magis 
ad externa vadit et felicius quo magis ad interna; quare, ut dicta, sicut ordine volvuntur seu exfasciantur externa, eo amoeniora et feliciora fiunt jucunda, quod satis constare potest inde quod jucundum 
voluptatum hominis dum in corpore vivit, vile sit respective ad jucundum ejus post vitam corporis cum venit in mundum spirituum, immo tam vile ut spiritus boni prorsus spernant jucunditates corporis, 
nec redire velint in eas si vel darentur iis omnes quae in universo mundo: [2] jucundum horum spirituum similiter vile fit cum elevantur a Domino in caelum spirituum angelicorum, tunc enim exuunt 
interiores eas jucunditates et induunt adhuc interiores: similiter spiritibus angelicis vile fit jucundum quod habuerunt in suo caelo, cum a Domino in caelum angelicum, seu tertium, attolluntur; in quo 
caelo quia interna vivunt, et non nisi quam amor mutuus, felicitas ibi est ineffabilis: de interiore jucundo seu felici videatur quod ab experientia n. 545.  [3] Ex his constare potest quid significat, 
quod 'sicut olus herbae dedi vobis id omne.' Quia 'reptilia' significant tam voluptates corporis quam voluptates sensualium, de quibus praedicatur 'olus herbae,' in lingua originali est vox{1} quae 
significat tam olus quam viride, 'olus' respective ad voluptates voluntariorum seu affectionum caelestium, 'viride' respective ad voluptates intellectualium seu affectionum spiritualium.  Quod 'olus 
herbae' ac 'viride herbae' significet vilia, constat in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, 	Aquae Nimrim desolationes erunt, quia exaruit gramen, consumpta est herba, viride non est, xv 6; </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Habitatores 
earum, breves manu consternati sunt, et pudore affecti; facti sunt herba agri et olus graminis, foenum tectorum, xxxvii 27; </p>
<p>'olus graminis' pro vilissimo: apud Mosen, 	Terra in quam tu venis 
ad possidendum eam, non sicut terra Aegypti ea, e qua exivisti, qua seras semen tuum et irriges pede tuo, sicut hortum oleris, Deut. xi 10; </p>
<p>ubi 'hortus oleris' pro vili: apud Davidem, 	Mali sicut gramen, 
subito exscinduntur, et sicut olus herbae consumentur, Ps. xxxvii 2; </p>
<p>ubi 'gramen et olus herbae' pro vilissimo. 	@1 Heb. [ ] (yereq).$ </p>
