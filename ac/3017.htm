<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3017节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3017.</strong>“耶和华在一切事上都赐福给他”表当一切事物都被主重新排列，归入神序时，或也可说，当主已重新排列一切事物，使其归入神序时。这从以下事实清楚可知：“耶和华”是主的神性本身（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="2018.htm">2018</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>节）；在这种情况下，亚伯拉罕代表主的神性人（<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>节）。因此，当经上说“耶和华在一切事上都赐福给他”时，内义上的意思就是，主通过其人性里面的神性本身重新排列一切事物，使其归入神序；因为当论及主的人性时，“赐福”就表示这些事。当论及人时，“被赐福或蒙福”表示富有属灵和属天之善良（参看<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>，<a href="1422.htm">1422</a>节）；当人所具有的事物被主重新排列，归入属灵和属天的秩序，因而归入神序的形像和样式（<a href="1475.htm">1475</a>节）时，他便富有它。人的重生并非别的。<br />至于“一切事物都被主在神性人里面重新排列，归入神序”这句话是什么意思，这从本章接下来的内容明显可知。也就是说，其由以撒所代表的神圣理性从亚伯拉罕所代表的神圣良善成孕，从撒拉所代表的神圣真理生出；现在，它被重新排列，归入神序，以便神圣真理能通过人性本身与它结合。这就是包含在本章内义中的奥秘，对此，天使通过主拥有清晰的光。因为这些事在天堂之光中如在大白天里那样清晰可见；但在世人所在的尘世之光中，除了重生之人因居于某种天堂之光而能在很小程度上模模糊糊看到某种事物外，几乎什么也看不见。</p>

And Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things. That this signifies when all things were disposed by the Lord into Divine order, or what is the same, when the Lord had disposed all things into Divine order, 
is evident from the fact that "Jehovah" is the Lord as to the Divine Itself (see n. 1343, 1736, 1815, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2921); and that in this case Abraham represents the Lord as to the Divine 
Human (n. 2833, 2836); and therefore when it is said that "Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things," in the internal sense is meant that the Lord from the Divine Itself in His Human disposed all things 
into Divine order; for to "bless," when said of the Lord's Human, signifies these things. For to "be blessed," when predicated of man, means to be enriched with spiritual and celestial good (see n. 
981, 1096, 1420, 1422); and he is enriched with it when the things in him are disposed by the Lord into spiritual and celestial order, thus into the image and likeness of Divine order (n. 1475); the 
regeneration of man being nothing else. But what is meant when it is said that all things were disposed by the Lord into Divine order in His Human, is evident from what follows in this chapter, namely, 
that His Divine rational, represented by Isaac, which was conceived from the Divine Good represented by Abraham, and was born of the Divine Truth represented by Sarah, was now disposed into such Divine 
order that Divine truths from the Human itself could be conjoined with it. These are the arcana contained in this chapter in the internal sense, concerning which the angels have clear light from the 
Lord. For in the light of heaven these things are open as in clear day; whereas in the light of the world in which man is, scarcely anything is so, except something in an obscure manner with one who 
is regenerate, for he also is in some light of heaven. </p>

'And Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things' means when all things had been re-arranged by the Lord into Divine order, or what amounts to the same, when the Lord had re-arranged all things into Divine 
order. This is clear from the consideration that 'Jehovah' is the Lord as regards the Divine Itself, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="2018.htm">2018</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, in which case 'Abraham' represents the Lord as regards 
the Divine Human, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>. Consequently when it is said that 'Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things' the meaning in the internal sense is that the Lord from the Divine Itself re-arranged all things 
in His Human into Divine order, for when 'blessing' is spoken of in regard to the Lord's Human it means those things. 'Being blessed', when it has reference to man, means being enriched with spiritual 
and celestial good, <a href="981.htm">981</a>, <a href="1096.htm">1096</a>, <a href="1420.htm">1420</a>, <a href="1422.htm">1422</a>; and he is so enriched when the things residing with him are re-arranged by the Lord into a spiritual and celestial order, and so into the image and likeness 
of Divine order, <a href="2475.htm">2475</a>. The regeneration of man is nothing else. </p>

 But what is described by the statement that all things were re-arranged into Divine order by the Lord within the Divine Human 
is evident from what follows in the present chapter. It describes how His Divine Rational, represented by Isaac, which had been conceived from the Divine Good, represented by Abraham, and born from 
the Divine Truth, represented by Sarah, was now re-arranged into that Divine order, to the end that Divine Truths from the Human itself could be joined to it. These are the arcana which this chapter 
contains in the internal sense and which angels possess from the Lord in full light, for in the light of heaven they are plain to see as if in broad daylight. But in the light of the world in which man 
dwells hardly anything is visible except dimly and in some small measure with a regenerate person, since he also dwells in some light belonging to heaven. </p>

`Et Jehovah benedixit Abrahamo in omnibus': quod significet cum a Domino in Divinum ordinem omnia disposita essent, seu quod idem, cum Dominus omnia in Divinum ordinem disposuit, constat inde quod `Jehovah' 
sit Dominus quoad ipsum Divinum, n. 1343, 1736, 1815, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2921, et quod tunc `Abrahamus' repraesentet Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum, n. 2833, 2836, quare cum dicitur quod 
`Jehovah benedixit Abrahamo in omnibus,' intelligitur in sensu interno quod Dominus ex ipso Divino in Humano Suo omnia in Divinum ordinem disposuerit, nam `benedicere' cum dicitur de Humano Domini, significat 
illa; `benedici' enim cum praedicatur de homine, est locupletari bono spirituali et caelesti, n. 981, 2096, 1420, 1422, et tunc locupletatur illo, cum illa quae apud eum a Domino in ordinem spiritualem 
et caelestem, ita in Divini ordinis imaginem et similitudinem disponuntur, n. 2475; regeneratio hominis nec aliud est.  [2] Quid autem sit, quod omnia a Domino in Divinum ordinem in Humano 
Suo disposita sint, patet ab illis quae in hoc capite sequuntur, nempe quod Divinum Ipsius Rationale, repraesentatum per `Jishakum,' conceptum a Divino Bono repraesentato per `Abrahamum,' et natum ex 
Divino Vero repraesentato per `Saram,' nunc in Divinum illum ordinem dispositum sit, ut Ipsi conjungi possent Divina Vera ex ipso Humano: haec sunt arcana, quae in hoc capite in sensu interno continentur, 
de quibus angeli claram lucem habent a Domino, nam in luce caeli haec patent sicut in clara die; at in luce mundi in qua homo, vix quicquam, nisi obscure aliquid apud regeneratum, is enim etiam est 
in aliqua luce caeli. </p>
