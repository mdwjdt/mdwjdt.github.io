<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第960节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>960.</strong>有些具有欺骗性的精灵在世时就暗中实施过欺诈，其中一些人为了骗人，还利用狡猾的手段伪装成天使。在来生，他们还学会如何撤退到更为精细或更为内在的本性中，以及如何使自己脱离其他人的视线，他们以为这样做就会免受一切惩罚。但是，他们和其他人一样，会照其欺骗的性质和恶毒而经受分解的惩罚，除此之外，他们还粘在一起。当有这种情况发生时，他们越想解散，即彼此挣脱，就粘得越紧。这种惩罚伴随着一种更剧烈的折磨，因为它报应他们更为隐蔽的欺骗。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]960.</strong> There are certain deceptive spirits who secretly committed fraud while they were living in the body. Some of them had been fiendishly clever at projecting an angelic image of themselves in order to dupe people. In the next life they learn how to disappear into a less substantial mode of existence and escape the gaze of others, so they consider themselves safe from all retribution. Like others, however, not only do they suffer different kinds of punishment by the rack (depending on the nature and malevolence of their fraud), they are also glued to each other. When this happens, the more they long to free themselves, or split apart, the more tightly they are bound together. This punishment entails fairly intense pain, as it comes in response to their rather well concealed deceits. </p>

There are certain deceitful spirits who while they lived in the body practiced their wiles in secret, and some of them in order to deceive have by pernicious arts feigned being as it were angels. In 
the other life these learn to withdraw themselves into a finer or more interior realm of nature [in subtiliorem naturam], and to snatch themselves away from the eyes of others, and in this way they suppose 
themselves to be safe from every penalty. But these, just like others, undergo the penalty of discerption in accordance with the nature and the wickedness of their deceit, and in addition to this 
they are glued together, and when this happens the more they desire to loose themselves-that is, to tear themselves away from one another-the more tightly they are fastened. This penalty is attended 
with a more intense torture because it answers to their more hidden deceptions. </p>

There are certain spirits given to deceit who while they lived in the world practised their deceptions in secret, some of whom in order to deceive have pretended by cunning devices to be angels. In the 
next life they learn in addition how to retreat into a less corporeal nature and to remove themselves out of everyone else's sight. They imagine that by doing this they are safe from all punishment. 
But they, like the others, not only undergo the punishments of mutilation in accordance with the nature and wickedness of their deception, but also they are all lumped together. And when this happens, 
the more they desire to disband themselves or cut loose from one another the more tightly they are bound together. A more drastic torment accompanies this punishment because it answers to their more 
concealed deceptions. </p>

</p><b>960.</b>
Sunt spiritus quidam dolosi qui dum vixerunt in corpore, dolos occulte egerunt, et quidam eorum qui artibus perniciosis simularunt quasi angelos decipiendi causa; in altera vita addiscunt se subducere 
in subtiliorem naturam seque eripere oculis aliorum, ita se ab omni poena tutos putantes; sed ii sicut alii non solum discerptionis poenas subeunt secundum doli eorum naturam et malitiam, sed etiam 
conglutinantur, quod cum fit, quo plus se dissolvere cupiunt seu ab invicem discindere, eo arctius ligantur; poena est cum intensiore cruciatu quia respondet eorum dolis absconditioribus. </p>
