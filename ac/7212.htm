<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7212节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7212.</strong>“将那地赐给你们为业”表主在那里的永生。这从“业”的含义清楚可知，“业”当论及天堂时，是指主的生命（参看<a href="2658.htm">2658</a>节）；由于作为业所赐的一切都是被赐之人永远的产业，在天堂是永恒的产业，还由于人们在那里活到永远，故所表示的是主在那里的永生。天堂里的生命是主的生命，因此那里的人拥有祂的生命在自己里面；这是因为他们拥有从主发出的真理和良善在自己里面，存在于真理里面的良善就是主自己，而拥有良善在里面的真理是从主流出的生命，所有人都靠这生命存活。由此明显可知，那些拥有良善在自己里面，并从这良善拥有真理的人，如天堂里的所有人，都拥有主的生命在自己里面。</p>

And I will give it you for an inheritance. That this signifies the Lord's life there to eternity, is evident from the signification of "inheritance," when predicated of heaven, as being the Lord's life 
(see n. 2658); and because everything given as an inheritance is the perpetual, and in heaven the eternal, possession of him to whom it is given, because there they live to eternity, the Lord's life 
there to eternity is signified. That the Lord's life is in heaven, consequently that those who are there are in His life, is because they are in the truth and good which proceed from the Lord, and the 
good which is in the truth is the Lord Himself, and the truth in which is the good is the life from the Lord from which all live. From all this it is evident that they who are in good and thence in 
truth, as are all in the heavens, are in the Lord's life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7212</b></p><p><b>7212.</b>
'And I will give it to you as an inheritance' means the Lord's life there lasting forever. This is clear from the meaning of 'an inheritance', when used in reference to heaven, as the Lord's life, dealt 
with in <a href="2658.htm">2658</a>; and since everything that is given as an inheritance is the perpetual possession of the one to whom it is given - in heaven the everlasting possession, since people live forever there 
- the Lord's life there lasting forever is meant. The reason why the life in heaven is the Lord's life, and why consequently those who are there have His life within them, is that they have within them 
the truth and goodness which emanate from the Lord; goodness that is present in truth is the Lord Himself, while truth that has goodness within it is the life flowing from the Lord by which they all 
live. From this it is evident that those who have good within themselves, and truth from that good, as all in heaven do, have the Lord's life within them. </p>

`Et dabo illam vobis hereditatem': quod significet vitam ibi Domini in aeternum, constat ex significatione `hereditatis' cum praedicatur de caelo, quod sit vita Domini, de qua n. 2658; et quia omne 
quod datur ut hereditas est illius cui datur possessio perpetua, in caelo aeterna, quia ibi vivunt in aeternum, significatur vita Domini ibi in aeternum.  Quod in caelo sit vita Domini, proinde quod illi 
qui ibi sint in vita Ipsius, est quia sunt in vero et bono quae procedunt a Domino, ac bonum quod in vero est Ipse Dominus, e verum in quo bonum est vita ex Domino, ex qua omnes vivunt; ex {1}his 
patet quod qui in bono sunt et inde in vero, ut sunt omnes qui in caelis, in vita Domini sint. 	@1 quibus$ </p>
