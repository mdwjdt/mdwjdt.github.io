<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5686节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5686.</strong>“他的兄弟，他母亲的儿子”表从属世层，如同从它的母亲所生的内在。这从便雅悯的代表清楚可知，便雅悯，即此处的“兄弟”和“母亲的儿子”，是指内在（参看<a href="5469.htm">5469</a>节）。他因是居间层，故是从属灵层的属天层，即“约瑟”，如同从一个父亲，并从属世层，如同从一个母亲那里产生的；因为他必须兼具这二者，以便充当一个居间层。因此，这就是从属世层，如同从它的母亲所生的内在所表示的。还因为属灵层的属天层，即“约瑟”，以同样的方式从如同一个母亲的属世层，但从如同一个父亲的神性那里产生，所以“便雅悯”被称为他的“兄弟，他母亲的儿子”，事实上他的确是如此出生的；接着他又被称为他的“儿子”。此处“约瑟”所表示的主在至高意义上称每一个但凡拥有从主而得的仁之良善的人为“兄弟”。祂还被称为“祂母亲的儿子”，但在这种情况下，“母亲”是指教会。</p>

His brother, his mother's son. That this signifies the internal from the natural as from a mother, is evident from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "brother" and "mother's son," as being 
the internal (see n. 5469); and as he is the intermediate he therefore comes forth from the celestial of the spiritual, which is "Joseph," as from a father, and from the natural as from a mother; for 
he must partake of both in order to serve as an intermediate. This then is what is meant by the internal from the natural as from a mother. And because the celestial of the spiritual, which is "Joseph," 
in like manner came forth from the natural as a mother, but from the Divine as a father, Benjamin is therefore called his "brother, the son of his mother," as indeed he was by birth. And presently 
he is called also his "son." The Lord, who is meant here by "Joseph" in the supreme sense, calls everyone a "brother" who has anything of the good of charity from the Lord. He is also called the "son 
of His mother," but then by "mother" is meant the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5686</b></p><p><b>5686.</b>
'His brother, his mother's son' means the internal born from the natural as its mother. This is clear from the representation of Benjamin, to whom 'brother' and 'mother's son' refer here, as the internal, 
dealt with in <a href="5469.htm">5469</a>. And since this is the intermediary it comes into being from the celestial of the spiritual, represented by 'Joseph', as its father, and from the natural as its mother; for it 
must have its beginning in both these if it is to serve as an intermediary. So this is what is meant by the internal born from the natural as its mother. Also because the celestial of the spiritual, 
which is 'Joseph', had come into being in a similar way from the natural as its mother, but from the Divine as its father, 'Benjamin' is therefore called, as he was in actual fact by birth, 'his brother, 
his mother's son'; and in what immediately follows he is also addressed as 'son'. The name 'brother' is used by the Lord, who is meant here in the highest sense by 'Joseph', to refer to everyone who 
has any good of charity which he has received from the Lord. He is also referred to as 'his mother's son', but in this case 'mother' is used to mean the Church. </p>

`Fratrem suum, filium matris suae':  quod significet  internum a naturali, ut a matre, constat a repraesentatione `Benjaminis'  qui hic `frater et filius matris', quod sit internum, de qua n. 5469, 
et quia est medium, ideo existit a caelesti spiritualis quod est `Josephus' ut a patre, et a naturali ut a matre, ab utroque enim trahet ut pro medio inserviat; hoc nunc est quod intelligitur per internum 
a naturali ut a matre; et quia caeleste spiritualis quod est `Josephus', similiter exstiterat a naturali ut a matre, sed a Divino ut a patre, ideo vocatur Benjamin, sicut ex nativitate etiam fuerat 
`frater suus, filius matris suae'; in mox sequentibus vocatur etiam `filius'.  Frater dicitur omnis a Domino, Qui hic per `Josephum' in supremo sensu intelligitur, qui aliquid boni charitatis habet 
a Domino; is quoque vocatur `filius matris suae', sed tunc per `matrem' intelligitur Ecclesia. </p>
