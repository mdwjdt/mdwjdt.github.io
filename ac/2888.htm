<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2888节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2888.</strong>事情的真相是，每个人的生命，无论世人的，灵人的，还是天使的，唯独从主流入。主是生命本身，并经由整个天堂，也经由地狱将它自身传下去，并以这种方式进入每个个体里面；这一过程是照着一种无法理解的秩序和系列来进行的。但每个人都是照着自己的性情来接受所流入的这生命。良善与真理被善者作为良善与真理来接受，却被恶者当作邪恶与虚假来接受，还被转化为他们里面的邪恶与虚假。这就像阳光，它照到地上的一切物体上，却照着每个物体的具体性质被接受，在优美的形态中呈现出美丽的色彩，在丑陋的形态中则呈现为丑陋的色彩。这在世上是一个奥秘，但在来世却是最清楚不过的事。为让我了解流注的这种性质，我被允许与同我在一起的灵人并天使对话，还感受并觉察他们的流注。这种事发生的次数太多了，以致我数不过来。不过，我也意识到，谬论将会盛行，也就是这一谬论：人们会以为他们通过自己意愿，通过自己思考，因而通过自己拥有生命；但是，再没有比这更离谱的事了。</p>

The truth is that the life of everyone, both of man, of spirit, and also of angel, flows in solely from the Lord, who is life itself; and diffuses itself through the whole heaven and also through hell, 
thus into everyone; and this in an order and series incomprehensible: but the life which flows in is received by each one according to his disposition. Good and truth are received as good and truth 
by the good; but good and truth are received as evil and falsity by the evil, and are also turned into evil and falsity in them. The case with this is comparatively like the light of the sun, which diffuses 
itself into all the objects of the earth, but is received according to the quality of each object, and becomes of a beautiful color in beautiful forms, and of a disagreeable color in disagreeable 
forms. In the world this is an arcanum, but nothing is better known in the other life. That I might know that influx is of such a nature, it has been given me to speak with the spirits and angels 
who were with me, and also to feel and perceive their influx; and this so often that I cannot number the times. But I know that the fallacy will prevail, the fallacy that is to say, that men will believe 
that they will from themselves, and think from themselves, and thus have life from themselves; whereas nothing is further from the truth. </p>

The truth of the matter is that the life which anyone has, whether man or spirit, or angel also, flows in solely from the Lord, who is Life itself, and spreads itself throughout the whole of heaven, 
and of hell also, and in this way enters into each individual, doing so according to an order and sequence beyond comprehension. But this inflowing life is received by each according to his own disposition. 
Good and truth are received by those who are good as good and truth, but by those who are evil as evil and falsity, and are also converted among such into evil and falsity. It is like the light 
of the sun which spreads itself into all objects on earth but is received according to the specific nature of each object, possessing a beautiful colouring in forms that are beautiful, and a hideous 
colouring in forms that are hideous. In the world this is an arcanum, but in the next life nothing is known better. To enable me to know the nature of such influx I have been allowed to speak to the spirits 
and to the angels present with me, and also to feel and perceive their influx, which has happened more times than I can number. But I realize that people will still be misled into believing that 
what they will is from themselves, and that what they think is from themselves, thus that they have life from themselves. But nothing could be further from the truth. </p>

</p><b>2888.</b>
Ita se habet cum vita cujusvis tam hominis quam spiritus, ut et angeli, quod illa influat solum a Domino, Qui est ipsa Vita, et se diffundat per universum caelum, etiam per infernum, ita in singulos, 
et hoc ordine et serie incomprehensibili; sed vita quae influit, recipitur ab unoquovis secundum ejus indolem; bonum et verum recipitur ut bonum et verum a bonis; at bonum et verum recipitur ut malum 
et falsum a malis, et quoque in malum et falsum apud hos venitur:  se habet hoc comparative sicut lux solis, quae se diffundit in omnia objecta telluris, sed recipitur secundum cujusvis objecti qualitatem, 
et fit pulchri coloris in pulchris formis, et tetri coloris in tetris formis:  hoc est arcanum in mundo, sed nihil notius in altera vita:  ut scirem quod talis influxus esset, mihi datum est loqui 
cum spiritibus et {1}angelis qui apud me, et quoque sentire et percipere influxum, et hoc tam saepe ut vices determinare numero nequeam; sed scio quod fallacia auferet, nempe quod credituri, se velle 
ex se, et se cogitare ex se, et sic vitam habere ex se, cum tamen nihil minus. @1 i cum$ </p>
