<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2874节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2874.</strong>由此明显可知何为自由，也就是说，自由就是出于情感思考和意愿，并且自由的性质和情感的性质是一样的。并且一种自由是地狱的，另一种自由是天堂的；地狱的自由来自地狱，而天堂的自由来自主。也显而易见，具有地狱自由的人无法进入天堂的自由，这等于从地狱进入天堂，除非其整个生命从他们那里被拿走；还有，若不被主改造，没有人能进入天堂的自由；当正被改造时，他就凭对良善与真理的情感，也就是凭植入教义真理的生命之善被引入天堂的自由。</p>

From this it is now evident what freedom is, namely, that it is to think and will from affection, and that the freedom is such as is the affection; also that the one freedom is infernal, and the other 
freedom heavenly, and that infernal freedom is from hell, whereas heavenly freedom is from the Lord. It is also evident that they who are in infernal freedom cannot come into heavenly freedom (which 
would be coming from hell into heaven) unless the whole of their life is taken away from them; also that no one can come into heavenly freedom except by reformation from the Lord; and that he is then 
introduced into it by the affection of good and truth, that is, by the good of life in which the truth of doctrine is being implanted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2874</b></p><p><b>2874.</b>
From this it is now evident what freedom is - namely thinking and willing from one's affection - and that the specific nature of one's freedom is the same as that of one's affection; also that the one 
kind of freedom is hellish, and the other heavenly; and that the former comes from hell, but the latter from the Lord. It is also evident that people with hellish freedom cannot enter into heavenly 
freedom - for this would amount to passing from hell into heaven - unless the whole of their life is taken away from them; also that nobody can enter into heavenly freedom without being reformed by the 
Lord, and that when being reformed he is brought to it by means of the affection for what is good and true, that is, by means of goodness of life that has the truth of doctrine implanted in it. </p>

</p><b>2874.</b>
Inde nunc patet quid liberum, nempe quod sit cogitare et velle ex affectione; et quod tale sit liberum qualis est affectio:  tum quod unum liberum sit infernale, et alterum liberum sit caeleste:  et 
quod liberum infernale sit ab inferno, liberum autem caeleste sit a Domino.  Patet quoque quod qui in libero infernali sunt, non possint venire in liberum caeleste, hoc foret ab inferno in caelum, nisi 
eis auferretur omne vitae: tum quod in liberum caeleste nemo venire possit nisi per reformationem a Domino, et quod tunc introducatur per affectionem boni et veri, hoc est, per bonum vitae cui implantetur 
verum doctrinae. </p>
