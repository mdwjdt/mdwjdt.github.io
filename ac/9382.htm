<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9382节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9382.</strong>“摩西来到，向百姓陈述”表主通过源于祂的神性真理所赐予的启示和教导。这从“摩西”的代表，以及“来到”和“陈述”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指圣言，因而神性真理方面的主，因为这真理就是圣言，如前所述（<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节）；“来到”当论及“摩西”所代表的圣言，或神性真理方面的主时，是指启示，因为当主到来，也就是出现在圣言中时，就会有启示；“陈述”是指教导。由此明显可知，“摩西来到，向百姓陈述”表示主通过神性真理所赐予的启示和教导。<br />也必须在此简要说明来自圣言的启示和教会是何性质。每个人都照着他对真理的情感和渴望程度，以及接受它的能力而从圣言获得启示和教导。那些获得启示之人的内在人就居于天堂之光，因为正是天堂之光在信之真理和良善上光照一个人（参看<a href="8707.htm">8707</a>，<a href="8861.htm">8861</a>节）。那些被如此光照的人就根据圣言的内在真理来理解圣言；正因如此，他们从圣言为自己确立指导方针或教义，然后将这指导方针或教义应用于字义，或说将字义与其联系起来。但那些对植根于良善的真理没有情感，由此没有任何变得智慧的渴望之人，在阅读圣言的时候，不是被光照了，而是变瞎了，因为他们并未居于天堂之光。在被称为自然之光的尘世之光中，他们只看见与世俗事物一致的东西。因此，外在感官所在的幻觉引导他们抓住在他们看来就像真理的虚假。这些人当中大多数人没有从圣言为自己确立指导方针或教义，仍持守字义；他们利用字义来支持虚假，尤其与爱自己爱世界一致的那类虚假。而那些与他们不同的人只是赞同或确认其教会的教义，却不关心也不知道它们是真还是假（参看<a href="4741.htm">4741</a>，<a href="5033.htm">5033</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="7012.htm">7012</a>，<a href="7680.htm">7680</a>，<a href="7950.htm">7950</a>，<a href="8521.htm">8521</a>，<a href="8780.htm">8780</a>节）。由此明显可知谁被圣言光照，谁变瞎了。也就是说，那些处于天堂之爱的人被光照，因为天堂之爱接受天堂的真理，像海绵一样吸收它们；这些爱也会自动与它们结合，就像灵魂和身体结合那样。而另一方面，那些陷入世俗之爱的人则变瞎了，因为这些爱接受虚假，也像海绵一样吸收它们；而且这些爱也自动与它们结合。因为良善和真理彼此一致；而另一方面，邪恶和虚假也彼此一致。正因如此，邪恶与虚假的结合被称为地狱的婚姻，该婚姻就是地狱本身；而良善与真理的结合被称为天堂的婚姻，该婚姻就是天堂本身。<br />圣言之所以是启示和教导的源头，是因为圣言在最初起源上是从主发出的神之真理本身，在降至世界的过程是被调整以适应众天堂。因此，当一个拥有天堂之爱的人阅读圣言时，他便通过圣言与天堂联结，通过天堂与主联结，由此获得启示和教导。当一个拥有世俗之爱的人阅读圣言时，情况就不同了。他不会与天堂联结，因而也不会获得启示和教导。天堂与世界，因而主与人类通过圣言联结（参看<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>e，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>e，<a href="9357.htm">9357</a>节）。</p>

And Moses came and reported to the people. That this signifies the enlightenment and instruction of the Lord through the Divine truth which is from Himself, is evident from the representation of Moses, 
as being the Lord in respect to the Word, thus in respect to the Divine truth, for this is the Word (see above n. 9372); from the signification of "coming," when said of the Lord in respect to the 
Word or the Divine truth, which is represented by Moses, as being enlightenment, for when the Lord comes, that is, is present in the Word, there is enlightenment; and from the signification of "reporting," 
as being instruction. From this it is plain that by "Moses came and reported to the people" is signified the enlightenment and instruction of the Lord through the Divine truth. [2] How the case 
is with enlightenment and instruction from the Word, shall also be briefly told. Everyone is enlightened and instructed from the Word according to his affection of truth, and longing for it, and according 
to his capacity of receiving it. They who are in enlightenment are in the light of heaven as to their internal man; for it is the light of heaven which enlightens man in the truths and goods of 
faith (see n. 8707, 8861). They who are thus illumined apprehend the Word in accordance with its interior things, and therefore make for themselves doctrine from the Word, to which they apply the sense 
of the letter. But they who are not in the affection of truth from good, and from this in the desire to be wise, are blinded rather than enlightened when they read the Word, for they are not in the 
light of heaven; and from the light of the world, which is called the light of nature, they see only what agrees with worldly things; and thus from the fallacies in which the external senses are, they 
embrace falsities which appear to them as truths. Most of these make for themselves no doctrine from the Word, but remain in the sense of the letter, which they apply so as to favor falsities, especially 
such as agree with the loves of self and of the world. But those who are not of this character merely confirm the doctrinal things of their church, and neither care nor know whether these are true 
or false (see n. 4741, 5033, 6865, 7012, 7680, 7950, 8521, 8780). From this it is evident who are enlightened from the Word, and who are blinded; namely, that those are enlightened who are in heavenly 
loves, for heavenly loves receive and like sponges imbibe the truths of heaven; and these are conjoined together of themselves, like soul and body. But on the other hand those are blinded who are in 
worldly loves, because these loves receive and like sponges imbibe falsities; with which also they are conjoined of themselves. For good and truth agree together, and so on the other hand do evil and 
falsity; and therefore the conjunction of evil and falsity is called the infernal marriage, which is hell itself; and the conjunction of good and truth is called the heavenly marriage, which is heaven 
itself.  [3] That the Word is the source of enlightenment and instruction, is because in its first origin it is truth Divine itself that proceeds from the Lord, and in its descent into the world is 
accommodated to all the heavens. Hence it is that when a man who has heavenly love reads the Word, he is through it conjoined with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, whereby he has enlightenment 
and instruction. It is otherwise when a man who has worldly love reads the Word. With him there is no conjunction of heaven; and therefore he has no enlightenment and instruction. (That through the 
Word there is a union of heaven and the world, thus of the Lord with the human race, see n. 9212, 9216, 9357.) </p>

'And Moses came and reported to the people' means enlightenment and instruction by the Lord, imparted through Divine Truth which springs from Him. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as 
the Lord in respect of the Word, and so in respect of Divine Truth since the Word is this, dealt with above in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>; from the meaning of 'coming' - when it refers to the Lord in respect of the Word or 
Divine Truth, represented by 'Moses' - as enlightenment, for when the Lord comes or He is present in the Word there is enlightenment; and from the meaning of 'reporting' as instruction. From all this 
it is evident that 'Moses came and reported to the people' means enlightenment and instruction by the Lord, imparted through Divine Truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A brief statement must also be made here regarding the 
nature of enlightenment and instruction from the Word. Everyone receives enlightenment and instruction from the Word according to his affection for truth and degree of desire for it, and according 
to his ability to receive it. The internal man of those who receive enlightenment dwells in the light of heaven, for the light of heaven is what enlightens a person in the truths and forms of the good 
of faith, <a href="8707.htm">8707</a>, <a href="8861.htm">8861</a>. Those who are in that way enlightened understand the Word according to its inner truths, which being so they establish for themselves from the Word guidelines, to which they then 
relate the literal sense. But those who have no affection for truth rooted in good nor consequently any desire to become wise are blinded rather than enlightened when they read the Word, since they 
do not dwell in the light of heaven. Indeed in the light of the world, called natural illumination, they gain no insights into things other than those of a worldly nature. And as a result of this the 
illusions to which their outward senses are subject lead them to seize on falsities which look to them like truths. The majority of these people therefore establish no guidelines for themselves but keep 
to the literal sense, which they use in support of falsities, especially such falsities as accord with self-love and love of the world. But those who are not like these do no more than assent to the 
teachings of their Church, without caring or knowing whether they are true or false. Regarding these, see <a href="4741.htm">4741</a>, <a href="5033.htm">5033</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>, <a href="7012.htm">7012</a>, <a href="7680.htm">7680</a>, <a href="7950.htm">7950</a>, <a href="8521.htm">8521</a>, <a href="8780.htm">8780</a>. From this it is evident who exactly they are 
who are enlightened by the Word and who exactly they are who are blinded. That is to say, those are enlightened who are governed by heavenly loves; for heavenly loves receive and like sponges soak up 
heaven's truths, and are also of their own accord joined to them in the manner of soul and body. On the other hand those are blinded who are ruled by worldly loves, since these loves receive and like 
sponges soak up falsities, and are also of their own accord joined to them. For good and truth accord with each other, as conversely do evil and falsity. This being so, evil and falsity joined together 
is called the hellish marriage, in which hell itself consists, while good and truth joined together is called the heavenly marriage, in which heaven itself consists.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why the Word 
is the source of enlightenment and instruction is that in its first origin the Word is God's truth itself emanating from the Lord, and on its way down into the world it is adjusted to suit all the heavens. 
Therefore when a person possessing a heavenly love reads it the Word links him to heaven and through heaven to the Lord, as a result of which he receives enlightenment and instruction. It is different 
when a person possessing a worldly love reads the Word. He is not linked to heaven and consequently has no enlightenment or instruction. Regarding the union of heaven and the world through the 
Word, and of the Lord with the human race, see <a href="9212.htm">9212</a> (end), <a href="9216.htm">9216</a> (end), <a href="9357.htm">9357</a>.  </p>

`Et venit Moscheh et renuntiavit populo': quod significet illustrationem et informationem Domini per Divinum Verum, quod ab Ipso, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Dominus quoad Verbum, 
ita quoad Divinum Verum, nam hoc est Verbum, de qua supra n. 9372; {1}ex significatione `venire' cum de Domino quoad Verbum seu {2}Divinum Verum, quod repraesentatur per `Moschen,' quod sit illustratio, 
nam cum Dominus venit seu praesens est in Verbo, est illustratio; et ex significatione `renuntiare' quod sit informatio; inde patet quod per `venit Moscheh et renuntiavit populo' significetur illustratio 
et informatio Domini per Divinum Verum. Quomodo se habet cum illustratione et informatione ex Verbo 2 etiam hic paucis dicetur: quisque illustratur et informatur ex Verbo secundum affectionem 
veri {3}et desiderii ejus gradum, ac secundum facultatem recipiendi; qui in illustratione sunt, illi quoad internum suum hominem in luce caeli sunt, nam lux caeli est quae illustrat hominem in veris 
et bonis fidei, n. 8707, 8861; qui ita {4}illuminantur, illi Verbum secundum interiora ejus capiunt; quapropter illi ex Verbo doctrinam sibi faciunt, ad quam applicant sensum litterae; {5}ast qui non 
in affectione veri ex bono sunt et inde in desiderio sapiendi, illi plus occaecantur quam illustrantur cum legunt Verbum, nam non in luce caeli sunt; et ex luce mundi, quae lumen naturae vocatur, non 
vident nisi talia quae concordant cum mundanis, et sic ex fallaciis {6}in quibus sunt sensus externi, falsa arripiunt quae apparent illis {7}sicut vera; {8}plurimi inde sibi nullam doctrinam faciunt, 
sed in sensu litterae manent, quem applicant ad favendum falsis, imprimis talibus quae cum amoribus sui et mundi concordant; at qui non tales sunt, illi modo confirmant doctrinalia suae Ecclesiae, et 
non curant nec sciunt num sint vera vel falsa, de quibus videatur n. 4741, 5033, 6865, 7012, 7680, 7950, 8521, 8780; inde patet quinam sunt qui ex Verbo illustrantur et quinam qui occaecantur, quod nempe 
illi illustrentur qui in amoribus caelestibus sunt, nam amores caelestes recipiunt, et quasi spongiae (x)imbibunt vera caeli, conjunguntur etiam ex se sicut anima et corpus; vicissim autem illi occaecantur 
qui in amoribus mundanis sunt, quoniam hi amores recipiunt et quasi spongiae imbibunt falsa, et conjunguntur {9}etiam ex se; bonum enim et verum concordant, et vice versa malum et falsum; quapropter 
conjunctio mali et falsi vocatur conjugium infernale, quod est ipsum infernum, et conjunctio boni et veri vocatur conjugium caeleste, quod est ipsum caelum. 3 Quod Verbum sit ex quo illustratio 
et informatio, est quia id in prima {10}origine est ipsum verum Divinum procedens a Domino, et in descensu in mundum accommodatum omnibus caelis, inde est, cum homo cui amor caelestis, legit Verbum, 
quod per illud conjungatur caelo, et per caelum Domino, inde illustratio et informatio; aliter cum homo cui amor mundanus, legit Verbum; apud illum non est conjunctio caeli, quapropter ei non illustratio 
et informatio; quod per Verbum sit unio caeli et mundi, ita Domini cum genere humano, videatur n. 9212 fin., 9216 fin., 9357. @1 i et$ @2 i quoad$ @3 i ex bono$ @4 illustrantur$ @5 at$ @6
