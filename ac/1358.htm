<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1358.</strong> 亚伯兰、拿鹤、哈兰都是真实的人物，系偶像崇拜者的民族也以他们命名。这从圣言的历史部分清楚可知。拿鹤的情况已经显明，因为这座城就叫“拿鹤的城”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.10.htm">24:10</a>）。那时，城无非是聚居<br />的各宗族；众多宗族组成一个民族。许多民族都出自亚伯拉罕，这不仅从以实玛利的后代或以实玛利人明显可知，还从他妻子基土拉所生儿子的后代明显可知，她儿子的名字在创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.4.htm">4</a>）出现过。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1358.</strong> The fact that Abram, Nahor, and Haran were real people, and that nations were named after them, whose members were idolaters, can be seen in the Word's narrative parts. The truth of this in respect to Nahor has already been demonstrated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1356#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1356:2</a>], since his city was actually called the city of Nahor (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_genesis_24_10" target=_top>Genesis 24:10</a>). In that day, cities were nothing but a number of clans living in the same place, and a collection of clans was a nation.<br />Many non-Jewish nations were born from Abraham, as can be seen not only from the descendants of Ishmael, or the Ishmaelites,{*1} but also from the descendants of the numerous children he had by his wife Keturah, who are named in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_1" target=_top>Genesis 25:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_2" target=_top>2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_4" target=_top>4</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Ishmael's descendants are listed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_13-16" target=_top>Genesis 25:13-16</a>. They and others of Abraham's descendants are listed again in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_1_29-42" target=_top>1 Chronicles 1:29-42</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1358</b></p><p><b>1358.</b>
That Abram, Nahor, and Haran were persons, from whom also nations were named that were idolaters, is evident from the historical parts of the Word. As regards Nahor this has been already shown; for the 
city was called the city of Nahor (Gen. 24:10). At that time cities were nothing else than families that dwelt together; and a number of families constituted a nation. That a number of nations were 
born of Abraham, is evident not only from the posterity of Ishmael, or the Ishmaelites, but also from that of his several sons by his wife Keturah, who are named in Genesis 25:1-4. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1358</b></p><p><b>1358.</b>
Abram, Nahor, and Haran were actual people after whom nations that were idolaters were also named, as is clear from the historical sections of the Word. That this was so in the case of Nahor has been 
shown already, for the city itself was called 'the city of Nahor', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24:10</a>. At that time cities were nothing else than families dwelling together; and many families constituted a nation. That many 
nations were born from Abraham is clear not only from the descendants of Ishmael, who were the Ishmaelites, but also from the descendants of his many sons born to his wife Keturah, whose names are given 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2025:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 25:1-4</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1358</b>
</p><b>1358.</b>
Quod Abram, Nahor et Haran fuerint personae, a quibus etiam gentes nominatae, quae fuerunt idololatrae, constat ex historicis Verbi; de Nahore ostensum est; ipsa enim urbs vocata erat 'urbs Nahoris,' 
Gen. xxiv 10; urbes illo tempore non fuerunt aliae quam familiae quae simul habitabant, et familiae plures non aliae quam gens:  quod ex Abrahamo plures gentes natae sint, constat non solum ex posteritate 
Ismaelis, seu Ismaelitis, sed etiam a posteritate plurium ejus filiorum ex Keturah uxore, qui nominantur Gen. xxv 1-4. </p>
