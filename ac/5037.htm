<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5037节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5037.</strong>“下在监牢，被囚在那里”之所以表示被引入涉及反对良善的谎言的试探中，是因为在脚底正下方及周围的整个地方就被称为“监牢”，那些经历消磨的人，也就是那些尽管持守虚假原则，并出于虚假过着邪恶生活，但仍有良善的意图之人就被关在那里。这类人无法被接入天堂，除非他们摆脱虚假原则，以及由此产生的生命快乐。那个地方的人就被引入试探，因为虚假原则和由此产生的生命快乐只能通过试探被逐出。他们所在的地方，确切地说，他们所处的状态，一般由“监牢”来表示，这些地方本身由“坑”来表示。至于来世的消磨，可参看前文（<a href="698.htm">698</a>，<a href="699.htm">699</a>，<a href="1106.htm">1106</a>-<a href="1113.htm">1113</a>，<a href="2699.htm">2699</a>，<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="2704.htm">2704</a>节）。那些经历消磨的人就被称为“被囚的”或“囚犯”；不是说他们真的戴上了手铐脚镣，而是说就他们以前的思维和由此产生的情感而言，他们缺乏自由。<br />这就是圣言中“被囚的”和“坐监的”所指之人的状况，这一点从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />我使你作众民的约，作外邦人的光，开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐黑暗的出监牢。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论及主和祂的到来。此处“开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐黑暗的出监牢”表示那些不知道良善与真理，然而又渴望知道并得到关于它们的教导之人。但在原文，“监牢”是以一个不同的词来表达的。<br /><br />少年人都藏在监牢中；他们成了掠物，无人拯救，无人说交还。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.22.htm">42:22</a>）<br />“少年人”在内义上是指信之真理，当这信之真理不再被承认时，经上就说它们“藏在监牢中”、“成了掠物”。<br />到那日，耶和华在高处必惩罚高处的众军，在地上必惩罚地上的列王。他们必被聚集，像囚犯困在坑中，并要囚在监牢里；多日之后便被察罚。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.21.htm">24:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.22.htm">22</a>）<br />“囚犯困在坑中”表示那些经历消磨的人，或那些经历试探的人。<br /><br />到降罚、消磨的日子，你们怎样行呢？它从远方临到；你们向谁逃奔得救助呢？凡不屈身的，都仆倒在被囚的和被杀的之下。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.3.htm">10:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“被囚的之下”表示在消磨的地方之下的地狱；“被杀的”表示那些通过虚假原则摧毁自己里面的信之真理之人，不亚于被剑所刺的人（关于他们，参看<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />祂必向列族讲和平，祂的权能必从这海管到那海，从大河管到地极。至于你，因着你立约的血，我必将被掳而囚的人，从无水的坑中释放出来。你们被囚而有指望的人，都要转回保障。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.10.htm">9:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“将被掳而囚的人释放出来”表示那些经历消磨和试探；因为他们经历消磨所在之地被称为“坑”（参看<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>，<a href="4744.htm">4744</a>节）。诗篇：<br />耶和华听了穷乏人，不藐视祂的被囚之人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.33.htm">69:33</a>）<br /><br />愿被囚之人的叹息达到你面前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗79.11.htm">79:11</a>）<br /><br />耶和华从天向地观察，要垂听被囚之人的叹息，要释放将要死的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.19.htm">102:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“被囚之人”表示那些经历消磨和试探的人。以赛亚书：<br />在悦纳的时候，我应允了你；在拯救的日子，我垂听了你；我要保护你，使你作众民的约，复兴遍地，使人承受荒凉之地为业。对那被捆绑的人说，出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说，显露吧！他们沿途必得喂养，在一切高处必有肥美的草场；不饥不渴。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />主耶和华的灵在我身上，因为耶和华用膏膏我，叫我传好信息给贫穷的人，绑扎心里破碎的；给被掳的宣告自由，给被囚的宣告释放，给瞎眼的宣告看见，宣告耶和华悦纳人的禧年。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.1.htm">61:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.2.htm">2</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华为受屈的伸冤，赐食物与饥饿的。耶和华释放被囚的。耶和华开了瞎子的眼睛。耶和华扶起被压下的人。耶和华喜爱义人。耶和华保护寄居的，扶持孤儿和寡妇。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗146.7.htm">146:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗146.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“被囚的”表示那些由于虚假而经历消磨和试探的人。从这些经文也明显可知马太福音中“被囚的”或“在监里的”指的是谁，同样“饥饿的”、“口渴的”和“客旅”指的又是谁：<br />那时，王要向那右边的说，我饿了，你们给我吃；渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了，你们看望我；我在监里，你们来探我。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.36.htm">36</a>）<br />关于这些经文，可参看本章的开头几节（<a href="4954.htm">4954</a>-<a href="4958.htm">4958</a>节）。</p>

That "to be put into the prison house, and to be kept bound there," denotes to be let into temptations as to false-speaking against good, is because all that region next under the sole of the foot and 
around about, is called a "prison house," where those are kept who are in vastation, that is, those who have been in principles of falsity and in a life of evil from falsity, and yet in good as to intentions. 
Such cannot be received into heaven until they have put off the principles of falsity, and also the delight of life thence derived. They who are there are let into temptations; for principles 
of falsity and the derivative delights of life cannot be cast out except by means of temptations. The place where they are, or rather the state in which they are, is signified in general by a "prison 
house," and the places themselves by "pits." In regard to vastations in the other life, see what has been said above (n. 698, 699, 1106-1113, 2699, 2701, 2704). They who are in vastations are called 
the "bound"-not that they are in any bond or chain, but that they are not in freedom as to their former thoughts and the derivative affections. [2] That such are they who are meant in the Word by the 
"bound," and by those who are "in prison," is plain from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>	I will give Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, 
to bring out the bound from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the house of confinement (Isa. 42:6-7); </p>
<p>speaking of the Lord, and of His coming. Here "to open the blind eyes, and to 
bring out the bound from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the house of confinement," denotes those who are in ignorance of good and truth, and yet are in the desire of knowing and being 
imbued with them; but in the original language "prison" is here expressed by a different word. [3] Again: </p>
<p>	All the youths are hid in prison houses; they are made for a prey, and none rescueth, and 
none saith, Bring forth (Isa. 42:22); </p>
<p>"youths" in the internal sense are the truths of faith, which are said "to be hid in prison houses," and "to be made for a prey," when they are no longer acknowledged. 
Again: </p>
<p>	It shall be in that day that Jehovah shall visit upon the army of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the ground upon the ground. And they shall be gathered, the bound over 
the pit, and they shall be shut over the place of confinement; after a multitude of days they shall be visited (Isa. 24:21-22); </p>
<p>"the bound over the pit" denotes those who are in vastations or those 
who are in temptations. [4] Again: </p>
<p>	What will ye do in the day of visitation, and of laying waste? It cometh from afar; to whom will ye flee for help? He who hath not bowed down himself; they shall 
fall under the bound, and under the slain (Isa. 10:3-4); </p>
<p>"under the bound" denotes the hell which is under the places of vastation; and "the slain" denotes those who have extinguished in themselves 
the truths of faith by principles of falsity, in a less degree than "the pierced," of whom see above (n. 4503). [5] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>	He shall speak peace to the nations; and His dominion shall be from 
sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. As for Thee also, by the blood of Thy covenant I will send forth the bound ones out of the pit wherein is no water. Return ye to the 
stronghold, ye bound ones of hope (Zech. 9:10-12); </p>
<p>"sending forth the bound out of the pit" denotes those who are in vastation and those who are in temptation. That the places where they are who are 
in vastation are called "pits" may be seen above (n. 4728, 4744). In David: </p>
<p>	Jehovah heareth the needy, and despiseth not His bound ones (Ps. 69:33). Again: </p>
<p>	Let the sighing of the bound one come 
before Thee (Ps. 79:11). Again: </p>
<p>	From the heavens did Jehovah look back to the earth, to hear the sighing of the bound one, to open to the sons of death (Ps. 102:19-20); </p>
<p>where "the bound ones" denote 
those who are in vastation, and those who are in temptations. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>	In the time of what is well pleasing have I answered Thee, and in the day of salvation have I heard Thee; and I have also 
guarded Thee, and I gave Thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the land, to share the wasted heritages, to say to them that are bound, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Unveil yourselves. 
They shall feed upon the ways, and in all the heights there is good pasture; and they shall not hunger nor thirst (Isa. 49:8-10). [6] Again: </p>
<p>	The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, Jehovah 
hath anointed me, He hath sent me to preach good tidings to the poor, and to bind up the broken-hearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and to the bound, to the holden in eyes, to proclaim the 
year of what is well pleasing to Jehovah (Isa. 61:1-2). In David: </p>
<p>	Jehovah, who executeth judgment for the oppressed; who giveth food to the hungry; Jehovah who looseth the prisoners; Jehovah who openeth 
the blind; Jehovah who raiseth up the bowed down; Jehovah who loveth the just; Jehovah who guardeth the strangers; He upholdeth the fatherless and the widow (Ps. 146:7-9); </p>
<p>"the bound" denote those 
who are in vastation and in temptations on account of falsities. From these passages it is also plain who are meant in Matthew by the "bound," or "those who are in prison," and likewise by the "hungry," 
the "thirsty," and "strangers": </p>
<p>	Then shall the King say to those who are on His right hand, I was hungry and ye gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and ye gave Me drink, I was a stranger and ye gathered 
Me, naked and ye clothed Me, I was sick and ye visited Me, I was in prison and ye came unto Me (Matt. 25:34-36); </p>
<p>regarding whom see the preface to this chapter (n. 4954-4958). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5037</b></p><p><b>5037.</b>
The reason why 'being committed to the prison-house' and 'being kept bound there' mean being subjected to temptations involving false-speaking against good is that the expression 'the prison house' is 
used for the entire place just beneath and round about the soles of the feet where those undergoing vastation are kept. Those undergoing vastation there are people who, in spite of their false assumptions 
and of their evil life arising from falsity, have nevertheless had good intentions. Such people cannot be received into heaven until they have divested themselves of their false assumptions and 
also of a living delight in them which sprang from these assumptions. People in that place are subjected to temptations, for the false assumptions and the living delights springing from these cannot 
be ousted except by means of temptations. The place where those people are, or rather the state which they are passing through, is meant in general by 'the prison-house' and those actual places by 'pits'. 
Regarding vastations in the next life, see <a href="698.htm">698</a>, <a href="699.htm">699</a>, <a href="1106.htm">1106</a>-<a href="1113.htm">1113</a>, <a href="2699.htm">2699</a>, <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="2704.htm">2704</a>. Those undergoing vastations are called 'the bound'; not that they are literally bound in any way but that they lack 
freedom so far as their previous thoughts and resulting affections are concerned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such is the condition of those meant in the Word by 'the bound' and by 'those who are in prison', as is evident 
from other places in the Word: </p>
<p> In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will give You to be a covenant of the people, a light of the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring the bound out of prison, out of the dungeon-house 
those who sit in darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord and His Coming. Here 'opening the blind eyes and bringing the bound out of prison, and out of the dungeon-house those who sit 
in darkness' stands for those who have no knowledge of goodness and truth but who nevertheless have the desire to know and be taught about these. But in this instance a different word is used in the 
original language to describe a prison. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
All the young men are hidden in prison houses; they have become a prey, and none delivers and none says, Bring out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The 
young men' in the internal sense are the truths of faith, which are said 'to be hidden in prison-houses and to become a prey' when they are not acknowledged any longer. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
It 
will be on that day, that Jehovah will visit the host of the height on high, and the kings of the ground on the ground, and the bound will be gathered together over the pit, and they will be shut in<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
the dungeon; after a multitude of days they will be visited. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The bound over the pit' stands for those undergoing experiences of vastation, that is, temptation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
What will you do on the day of visitation and vastation? It will come from afar. To whom will you flee for help? [Anyone] who has not bowed himself down will fall beneath the bound and beneath 
the slain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Beneath the bound' stands for the hell which lies below the places of vastation.' The slain' stands for those who through the false assumptions adopted by them have 
destroyed the truths of faith to a smaller extent than those pierced [by the sword] have done, dealt with in <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
He will speak peace to the nations, and His dominion will be 
from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. Also as for You, through the blood of Your covenant I will let out the bound ones from the pit in which there is no water. Return to 
the stronghold, O bound ones of hope. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:10-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Letting out the bound ones from the pit' stands for those who are undergoing vastation and temptation; for the places where such undergo vastation 
are called 'pits', see <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>, <a href="4744.htm">4744</a>. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah hears the needy and does not despise His bound ones. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Let the groaning of him who is bound come before 
You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2079:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 79:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah looked from the heavens towards the earth to hear the groaning of him who was bound, to open to the sons of death. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20102:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 102:19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Those who are bound' 
stands for those who are undergoing vastation and temptations. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
In a time of good pleasure I have answered You, and in a day of salvation I have helped<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> You; I have also guarded You, 
and I have given You for a covenant of the people to restore the land, to apportion the inheritances that have been laid waste, to say to those that are bound, Go out; and to those who are in darkness, 
Reveal yourselves. They will feed<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> along the roads, and on all slopes will their pasture<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> be. And they will neither hunger nor thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:8-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:8-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>The Spirit 
of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me, Jehovah has anointed Me; to bring good tidings to the poor He has sent Me, and to bind up the broken in heart; to preach liberty to captives, and to those who are bound, 
to him who is blind; to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure. </p>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah who executes judgement for the oppressed, who gives bread to the hungry; Jehovah who sets the bound free; 
Jehovah who opens the blind [eyes]; Jehovah who lifts up the bowed down; Jehovah who loves the righteous; Jehovah who guards strangers, upholds the orphan and the widow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20146:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 146:7-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The bound' 
stands for those who are undergoing vastation and temptations because of falsities. </p>
<p>From all these places it is also evident who are meant in Matthew by those who are bound or 'in prison' and likewise 
who are meant by 'the hungry, the thirsty, and strangers', </p>
<blockquote>
Then the King will say to those at His right hand, I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I was a stranger 
and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me around, I was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:34-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:34-36</a>

{1}  Quod `dari in domum carceris' et `ibi vinctus teneri' sit mitti in tentationes quoad falsiloquium contra bonum, est inde quia `domus carceris' vocatur omnis ille locus proxime sub planta pedis 
et circumcirca ubi illi tenentur qui in vastatione sunt, hoc est, illi qui in principiis falsi et in vita mali ex falso fuerunt, et tamen in bono quoad intentiones; tales non recipi in caelum possunt 
priusquam principia falsi exuerunt, et quoque jucundum vitae quod fuit inde; qui ibi sunt, mittuntur in tentationes, nam principia falsi et jucunda vitae inde non nisi quam per tentationes ejici 
queunt; locus ubi illi sunt, seu potius status in quo sunt, significatur in genere per `domum carceris' et ipsa loca per `foveas'; de vastationibus in altera vita, videantur n. 698,699, 1106-1113, 
2699, 2701, 2704.  Illi qui in vastationibus sunt, vocantur `vincti', non quod in aliquo vinculo sint sed quod in non libero quoad cogitationes priores et inde affectiones; quod tales sint qui in 
Verbo intelliguntur per `vinctos' et `qui in Carcere' {2}, patet (o)ex Verbo alibi; ut apud Esaiam,           Dabo Te in foedus populi, in lucem gentium, ad      aperiendum oculos caecos, ad educendum

incurvavit se, infra vinctum et infra occisos      cadent, x 3, 4; </p>
<p>`infra vinctum' pro {5} inferno quod est sub locis vastationis; </p>
<p>`occisi' pro illis qui apud se per principia falsi exstinxerunt vera 
fidei in minore gradu quam confossi, de quibus n. 4503: [5] apud Zachariam,           Loquetur pacem gentibus, et erit dominari Ipsius a      mari usque ad mare, et a flumine usque ad fines terrae: </p>
<p> 
    etiam quod ad Te, per sanguinem foederis Tui, emittam      vinctos e fovea in qua non aqua.  Revertimini ad      munimentum vincti spei, ix 10-12; </p>
<p>`emittere vinctos e fovea' pro illos 
qui in vastatione sunt et qui in tentatione; quod loca ubi illi qui in vastatione, dicantur `foveae', videatur n. 4728, 4744 apud Davidem,           Exaudit egenos Jehovah, et vinctos suos non spernit,  
    Ps. lxix 34 [A.V.33]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Veniat ante Te gemitus vincti, Ps. lxxix 11: </p>
<p> apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Jehovah e caelis ad terram respexit, ad audiendum      gemitum vincti, 
ad aperiendum filiis mortis, Ps. cii 20,      21 [A.V. 19, 20]; </p>
<p> `vincti' pro illis qui in vastatione, et qui in tentationibus: apud Esaiam, </p>
<p>          In tempore beneplaciti respondi Tibi, 
et in die      salutis audivi Te, custodivi etiam Te, et dedi in foedus      populi, ad restituendum terram, ad partiendum hereditates      vastatas, ad dicendum vinctis, Exite, eisque qui in   
   tenebris, Revelamini; super viis pascent, et in omnibus      clivis pascuum bonum; et non esurient, neque sitient,      xlix 8, 9, [10]: </p>
<p> [6] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Spiritus Domini Jehovae super 
me, unxit Jehovah me,      ad evangelizandum pauperibus misit me, et ad obligandum      fractos corde, ad praedicandum captivis libertatem, et      vinctis {6}, oculis capto, ad proclamandum annum  
    beneplaciti Jehovae, lxi 1, 2: </p>
<p> apud Davidem, </p>
<p>          Jehovah Qui facit judicium oppressis, Qui dat panem      esurientibus, Jehovah Qui solvit vinctos, Jehovah Qui      aperit caecos, 
Jehovah Qui erigit incurvatos, Jehovah Qui      amat justos, Jehovah Qui custodit peregrinos, pupillum et      viduam sustentat, Ps. cxlvi 7-9; </p>
<p> `vincti' pro illis qui in vastatione et tentationibus 
sunt propter falsa.  Ex his locis etiam patet quinam per `vinctos' seu illos qui in carcere, et similiter quinam per `esurientes, sitientes, peregrinos' intelliguntur apud Matthaeum, </p>
<p>   
       Tunc dicet Rex iis qui a dextris Ipsius,... Esurivi      et dedistis Mihi edere, sitivi et potastis Me, peregrinus      fui et collegistis Me, nudus et circuminduistis Me,      aegrotus et visitastis 
Me, in carcere fui et venistis ad      Me, xxv 34-36; </p>
