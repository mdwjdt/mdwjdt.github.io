<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1472.</strong>“埃及人看见你”表由认知构成的知识，当属天的认知被看到时，其性质被如此描述。这从“埃及”的含义清楚可知，“埃及”表由认知构成的知识，如前所述。由此明显可知“埃及人看见你”这句话表示什么，即，这知识的性质就是诸如本节所描述的样子。这就是由认知构成的知识的情形；它还有某种属世之物在里面，这表现在儿童刚开始学习的时候，也就是说，事物越高级，他们就越渴望，当他们听说这些事物是属天的和神性时，更是渴望。不过，这种快乐是属世的，是由属外在人的强烈欲望所产生的。对其他人来说，这种强烈欲望使他们唯独以认知构成的知识为乐，而不再着眼于其它目的；然而，认知构成的知识无非是为了实现目的，即“用”而存在的某种手段。也就是说，认知只是用来充当属天、属灵之物的容器，当发挥这种功用时，它们初次在其功用中，并通过这功用而接受自己的快乐。若稍加留意，谁都能明白，认知构成的知识无非是一种手段，人能藉此变得理性，并因此变得属灵，最终变得属天；他的外在人则能凭这些知识与他的内在人联结；当这一切成就时，他就处于用本身，内在人只关注用。为了同样的目的，主也逐渐进入童年和青少年时在知识中所体验的快乐中。但是，当人开始唯独以知识为乐时，这种身体的渴望会将他裹挟走；裹挟的程度，也就是唯独以知识为乐的程度，就是他远离属天之物的程度，也就是知识向主封闭自己、退化到物质的程度。不过，越是以用为目的学习知识，如为了人类社会，为了主在地上的教会，为了主在天上的国度，尤其为了主自己的缘故，它们就越向主打开。由于这些原因，天使虽拥有所有认知构成的知识，甚至人几乎无法理解其万分之一，但与用相比，他们认为这些知识毫无价值。由此可见“埃及人看见你必说，这是他的妻子，他们就要杀我，却叫你存活”这些话表示什么。之所以提及这些事，是因为主在孩童时就知道这一点，并且也是这样想的。也就是说，若祂唯独被对认知构成的知识的强烈渴望裹挟走，这种知识就会具有这样的性质，即祂不再对属天之物感兴趣，只对那些被对知识的强烈渴望紧紧抓住的认知感兴趣。有关这些问题的更多内容可见于下文。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1472.</strong> And it will happen when the Egyptians see you symbolizes the study of religious concepts; what is being depicted is the turn that study takes when the people who engage in it see heavenly concepts. This is evident from the symbolism of Egypt as the study of religious concepts, which has been demonstrated already [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164" target=_top>1164-1165</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1194" target=_top>1194-1195</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1462" target=_top>1462</a>]. From this you can tell what "if the Egyptians see" means: that the character of this study is depicted in the present verse.{*1} Such a characteristic is inherent in the knowledge of religious concepts and is an earthly element of it. It asserts itself in young people when they are just starting to learn; the loftier a subject is, the more they want to know about it. When they hear that a subject has heavenly or divine implications, they are still more eager. But the thrill involved is an earthly one and rises out of a craving that belongs to the outer self.<br />In people other [than the Lord], this craving causes them to find pleasure only in the bare study of religious knowledge, without any other goal. The reality is that the study of such knowledge is merely a kind of tool designed to fulfill a use. To be specific, the knowledge is intended to serve as a vessel for heavenly and spiritual entities. When it serves this purpose, then it first comes into use, and all the pleasure it provides comes from the use of it.<br />[2] Anyone who pays attention can see that in itself a store of religious knowledge is just a means for becoming rational, then spiritual, and at last heavenly. The knowledge can then bring our outer being into contact with our inner being, and when this happens, our study of it has served its true purpose. The inner self, after all, concerns itself only with that which is useful. For the same reason, the Lord imparts the pleasure that youth and early adulthood discovers in learning things. When we start to put our delight in bare learning, however, it is a bodily desire that carries us away. Insofar as it carries us away 钬?insofar as we find pleasure in mere learning 钬?so far we remove ourselves from heaven, and so far the facts we know shut themselves off from the Lord, to partake of the material world. On the other hand, insofar as we acquire facts for some useful purpose 钬?for the sake of human society, of the Lord's church on earth, of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, or (most especially) of the Lord himself 钬?so much more do they open up. Angels possess all religious knowledge, and their knowledge is so broad that hardly one part in ten thousand can be passed on to people on earth in an entirely comprehensible way. Yet knowledge itself counts for nothing with angels, compared to the use it can serve.<br />[3] These considerations indicate what is meant by the words "When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 钬楾his is his wife,' and kill me and keep you alive."<br />The Lord realized all this when he was young and thought along these lines, which is why I explain the phrase as I do: knowledge is inherently such that if the Lord had been carried away by the naked desire for learning religious concepts, he would have grown indifferent to any heavenly dimensions and cared only for the knowledge itself. And he would then have been robbed of this knowledge by the craving to acquire it.<br />I will have more to say on this below.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Apparently the reference is to the meaning expounded in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1471" target=_top>1471-1474</a>: when people who engage in academic study of inner knowledge "see," they tend to act the way Abram predicts the Egyptians will here; they recognize the knowledge as a "wife" (heavenly truth) and desire it but want to "kill Abram" (indulge in it for its own sake rather than for some useful purpose). [LHC]<br />{*2} The role of knowledge in the early life of the Lord is discussed throughout the rest of this chapter. [LHC] </p>

And it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee. That this signifies the memory-knowledge of knowledges, which is described as to what it is when they see celestial knowledges, is evident 
from the signification of "Egypt," which is the memory-knowledge of knowledges, as before shown; and from this it is evident what is signified by the words "when the Egyptians see," namely, that this 
memory-knowledge is such as is described in this verse. The memory-knowledge of knowledges is attended with this, and it is something natural in it, as is manifested in children when they first begin 
to learn, namely, that the higher things are, the more they desire them; and still more when they hear that they are celestial and Divine. But this delight is natural, and arises from a desire that 
is of the external man. With other men this desire causes them to feel delight in the mere memory-knowledge of knowledges, without any further end; when yet the memory-knowledge of knowledges is nothing 
but an instrumental agency having for its end a use, namely, that the knowledges may serve celestial and spiritual things as vessels; and when they are thus serving, they are then for the first time 
in their use, and receive from the use their delight. Anyone can see, if he pays attention, that in itself the memory-knowledge of knowledges is nothing but a means whereby a man may become rational, 
and thence spiritual, and at last celestial; and that by means of the knowledges his external man may be adjoined to his internal; and when this is done, he is in the use itself.  The internal man 
regards nothing but the use. For the sake of this end also, the Lord insinuates the delight that childhood and youth perceives in memory-knowledges. But when a man begins to make his delight consist in 
memory-knowledge alone, it is a bodily cupidity which carries him away, and in proportion as he is thus carried away (that is, makes his delight consist in mere memory-knowledge), in the same proportion 
he removes himself from what is celestial, and in the same proportion do the memory-knowledges close themselves toward the Lord, and become material. But in proportion as the memory-knowledges are 
learned with the end of use,-as for the sake of human society, for the sake of the Lord's church on earth, for the sake of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and still more for the Lord's own sake,-the 
more are they opened toward Him. On this account also the angels, who are in the memory-knowledge of all knowledges, and indeed to such a degree that scarcely one part in ten thousand can be presented 
to the full apprehension of man, yet esteem such knowledge as nothing in comparison with use.  From what has been said it may be seen what is signified by the words, "When the Egyptians shall see 
thee, they will say, This is his wife; and they will kill me, and will make thee to live." These things were said because the Lord when a child knew this and thought in this way, namely, that if He 
should be carried away by a mere desire for the memory-knowledge of knowledges, this memory-knowledge is of such a character that it would care no more for celestial things, but only for the knowledges 
[cognitiones] which the desire for memory-knowledge would carry away. On these subjects more follows. </p>

That 'it will be, when the Egyptians see you' means knowledge comprised of cognitions, it being the nature of that knowledge when celestial cognitions are seen that is described, becomes clear from the 
meaning of 'Egypt' as knowledge comprised of cognitions, as shown already And from this what the words 'if the Egyptians see you' mean may become clear, namely that this knowledge is such as is described 
in the present verse Such is the case with knowledge comprised of cognitions; and it has also a certain naturalness within it, as is manifested in children when they first start to learn - that 
is to say, the higher things are, the more they desire them; and all the more so when they hear that these things are celestial and Divine. But this delight is natural and arises from a strong desire 
that belongs to the external man With others that strong desire causes them to take delight solely in knowledge comprised of cognitions, without any other end in view; yet that knowledge is nothing else 
than a certain means that exists to achieve an end, which is use. That is to say, cognitions exist to serve as vessels for celestial and spiritual things, and when they are performing that service, 
for the first time they have a use, and from that use receive their delight. It may become clear to anyone, if he pays the matter any attention, that in itself the knowledge comprised of cognitions 
exists for no other reason than that a person should become rational, and from that become spiritual, and at length celestial, and that by means of those cognitions his external man may be allied to his 
internal. When this point is reached he has arrived at the use itself, the internal man having nothing else than uses in view. For the sake of the same end also the Lord instills the delight that childhood 
and youth experience in forms of knowledge. When however a person begins to take delight in knowledge alone, it is a bodily desire that carries him away; and to the extent it carries him away, 
that is, to the extent he takes delight in knowledge alone, to the same extent does he move away from what is celestial, and to the same extent do the facts he knows close themselves up in the Lord's 
direction and become materially inclined. But insofar as facts are learned with a view to use - such as for the sake of human society, for the sake of the Lord's Church on earth, for the sake of the 
Lord's kingdom in heaven, and still more for the sake of the Lord Himself - the more they are opened out towards Him. For these reasons also the angels, who possess the knowledge that is comprised of 
all cognitions - having so full a possession of it that scarcely one ten thousandth part of what they know can be presented to man's entire mental grasp - nevertheless place no value at all in knowledge 
when compared with use. These considerations show what is meant by the words, 'when the Egyptians see you they will say, This is his wife, and they will slay me and let you live'. It is because the 
Lord when He was a boy knew this and thought in this way, that these things have been stated, namely that if He were to be carried away by a strong desire for nothing else than the knowledge that is 
comprised of cognitions, this knowledge would be such that He would have no interest any more in celestial things but only in the cognitions which that strong desire for knowledge would seize upon. More 
regarding these matters follows below. </p>

'Et erit, cum viderint te Aegyptii': quod significet scientiam cognitionum, quae describitur qualis est cum cognitiones caelestes vident, constare potest a significatione 'Aegypti' quod sit scientia 
cognitionum, ut prius ostensum; et inde quid significet 'si viderint Aegyptii,' quod nempe talis sit qualis describitur in hoc versu; scientia cognitionum hoc secum habet; et est quoddam naturale quod 
inest; etiam manifestatur apud pueros cum primum incipiunt discere; nempe quo altiora sunt eo magis (x)cupiunt, cumque audiunt quod caelestia et Divina, adhuc magis; sed hoc jucundum est naturale, et 
oritur a cupidine quae est externi hominis: haec cupido facit apud homines alios quod jucundum modo ponant in scientia cognitionum absque alio fine, cum tamen scientia cognitionum non aliud sit quam 
quoddam instrumentale, ob finem usus ut nempe inserviant caelestibus et spiritualibus pro vasis, et tunc primum cum inserviunt, sunt in usu, et jucundum suum ab usu accipiunt: unicuique constare potest 
si attendit, quod scientia cognitionum in se nihil aliud sit quam ut homo fiat rationalis, et inde spiritualis, et tandem caelestis, et per illas externus ejus homo adjungatur interno, quod cum fit, 
est in ipso usu; internus homo nihil spectat nisi usus; ob illum finem etiam insinuat Dominus jucundum quod percipit pueritia et adolescentia in scientiis; cum autem homo incipit jucundum ponere sola 
scientia, est cupiditas corporea quae aufert, et in quantum aufert seu ponit in sola scientia, in tantum removet se a caelesti et in tantum scientifica se claudunt versus Dominum et fiunt materialia; 
quantum vero scientifica addiscuntur ob finem usus, ut propter societatem humanam, propter Ecclesiam Domini in terris, propter regnum Domini in caelis, et magis propter Dominum, eo magis aperiuntur; 
quare etiam angeli, qui in scientia omnium cognitionum sunt, et quidem tali ut vix una pars myriadis possit tradi ad plenum captum hominis, usque scientias pro nihilo aestimant respective ad usum.  Ex 
his constare potest quid significatur per haec, 'cum viderint te Aegyptii, et dicent, Uxor illius haec, et occident me, et te vivificabunt: hoc quia novit Dominus cum Puer et ita cogitavit, haec dicta 
sunt, nempe si a sola cupidine scientiae cognitionum auferretur, quod tunc scientia talis sit, ut caelestia non magis curet, sed modo cognitiones, quas cupido scientiae auferret: de his sequuntur plura. </p>
