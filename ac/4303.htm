<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4303节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4303.</strong>“故此，以色列的孩子不吃大腿窝上的坐骨神经筋”表不吸收含有虚假的真理。这从“吃”和“筋”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指结合并变成自己的（参看<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>节）；“筋”是指真理，因为良善里面的筋就像肉里面的筋；“筋”在灵义上也表示真理，“肉”表示良善（<a href="3579.htm">3579</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>节）。在以西结书，“筋”和“肉”具有类似含义：<br />主耶和华对这些骸骨如此说：我必给你们加上筋，使你们长肉，使气息进入你们里面；我观看，见骸骨上有筋，也长了肉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.5.htm">37:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处所论述的主题是人的新造，也就是人的重生。不过，一旦真理被扭曲，它们就不再是真理，并且它们越被扭向真理的反面，就越接近虚假。这就是为何“坐骨神经筋”表示虚假。“大腿窝上的筋”表示婚姻之爱与属世良善结合所在的点，因而表示属灵真理流入属世良善所在的点（参看<a href="4277.htm">4277</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>节）。由此明显可知，“故此，以色列的孩子不吃大腿窝上的坐骨神经筋”表示不吸收含有虚假的真理。这些事之所以论及以色列人，是因为“以色列”表示神性属天-属灵层（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节），“孩子”或“儿子”表示真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节）。因此，这意思是，属于神性属天-属灵层的真理不会吸收任何虚假作为自己的一部分。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4303</b></p><p><b>4303.</b>
Therefore the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which was displaced, which is upon the hollow of the thigh. That this signifies that those truths were not appropriated in which were falsities, 
is evident from the signification of "eating," as being to be conjoined and appropriated (see n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832); and from the signification of a "nerve" as being truth; for truths 
in good are circumstanced as are nerves in the flesh, and moreover in the spiritual sense truths are nerves, and good is flesh (n. 3813). Similar things are also signified by sinews* and flesh in Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    Thus said the Lord Jehovih unto these bones, I will put sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and I will put breath in you; and I beheld, and lo, there were sinews upon them, 
and flesh came up (Ezek. 37:5-6, 8). Here the subject treated of is the new creation of man, that is, his regeneration. But when truths have been distorted, they then no longer become truths, but in 
proportion as they are distorted to what is opposite, they accede to falsities; and hence it is that by the "nerve of that which was displaced" is signified falsity. (That the hollow of the thigh is 
where there is the conjunction of conjugial love with natural good, consequently where there is influx of spiritual truth into natural good, may be seen above, n. 4277, 4280.) Hence it is evident that 
by "therefore the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which was displaced which is upon the hollow of the thigh," is signified that those truths were not appropriated in which were falsities. That 
these things are said of the sons of Israel because by "Israel" is signified the Divine celestial spiritual, may be seen above (n. 4286), and by "sons" truths (n. 489, 491, 2623); and thus the meaning 
is that the truths of the Divine celestial spiritual did not appropriate to themselves any falsities. * The Latin word nervus means both a nerve and a sinew. That in Gen. 32 the great nervus ischiadicus 
or sciatic nerve is meant, see n. 5051. [Reviser] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4303</b></p><p><b>4303.</b>
'Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sinew of that which was displaced, which is on the hollow of the thigh' means that no truths containing falsities were assimilated. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'eating' as being joined to and made one's own, dealt with in <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a>, <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>, and from the meaning of 'the sinew' as truth, for truths within good are like sinews within 
the flesh, and truths are also meant in the spiritual sense by 'sinews' and good by 'flesh', <a href="3579.htm">3579</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>. 'Sinews' and 'flesh' have a similar meaning in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih to 
these bones, I will lay sinews upon you and cover you with flesh, and I will put spirit within you I looked, and behold, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:6,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:6, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the new creation 
of man, that is, the regeneration of him, is the subject But once truths have been distorted they cease to be truths any longer; and the more they are distorted into the reverse of truths the 
nearer they get to falsities. This is why 'the sinew of that which was displaced' means falsity For 'the hollow of the thigh' means the point where conjugial love is joined to natural good, and therefore 
the point where the influx of spiritual truth into natural good takes place, see <a href="4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>. From this it is evident that 'therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sinew of that which was displaced, 
which is on the hollow of the thigh' means that no truths containing falsities were assimilated. The reason why these things are said concerning the children of Israel is that 'Israel' means 
the Divine celestial-spiritual, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, while 'children' or 'sons' means truths, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>. So the meaning is that the truths belonging to the Divine celestial-spiritual did not assimilate any falsities 
as part of themselves. </p>

`Propterea non edunt filii Israelis nervum emoti {1}, qui super vola femoris': quod significet quod non appropriata illa in quibus falsa,, constat ex significatione `edere' quod sit conjungi et appropriari, 
de qua n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3513, 3590, 3632; et ex significatione `nervi' quod sit verum, vera enim in bono se habent sicut nervi in carne, et quoque vera sunt in spirituali sensu `nervi' 
et bonum `caro,' n. 3813, `3579': similia etiam per nervos et carnem significantur apud Ezechielem,           Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih ossibus his, Dabo super vos      nervos, et obducam super 
vos carnem, et dabo in vobis      spiritum:... et vidi, cum ecce super illis nervi, et caro      ascendit, xxxvii 6, 8; </p>
<p>ibi de nova creatione hominis, hoc est, de regeneratione ejus agitur; cum autem 
vera detorta sunt, tunc non amplius fiunt vera, sed sicut detorquentur `ad oppositum, ita accedunt ad falsa, inde est quod per `nervum emoti' significetur falsum: quod `vola femoris' sit ubi conjunctio 
amoris conjugialis cum bono `naturali, proinde ubi influxus veri spiritualis in bonum naturale, videatur n. 4277, 4280; inde patet quod per `propterea non edunt filii Israelis nervum emoti 
qui super vola femoris' significetur quod non appropriata illa in quibus falsa.  Quod haec de filiis Israelis dicantur, est causa quia per `Israelem' significatur Divinum caeleste spirituale, n. 
4286, et per `filios' vera, n. 489, 491, 2623, ita quod vera Divini caelestis spiritualis non appropriaverint sibi aliqua falsa.      @1 Heb. [ ] (gid hannasheh) = sinew, or nerve, of the hip; n. 5051 
suggests that `nerve' is here meant.$      @2 versus$      @3 naturalis$ </p>
