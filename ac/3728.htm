<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3728节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3728.</strong>“在它头顶浇油”表它所源于的神性良善。这从“油”和“头”的含义清楚可知：“油”是指爱的属天要素，或良善（参看<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>节）；“头”是指高层之物，或也可说，内层之物。良善是高层或内层，而真理是低层或外层，这在前面多处已说明。由此明显可知在柱顶浇油的古代仪式是什么意思，即真理不可没有良善，而是要根植于良善，因此良善要掌权，就像头立于躯体之上那样。因为没有良善的真理并非真理，只是一种毫无生命和意义的声音，就是会化为乌有的那类事物。在来世，它在那些虽然在认识真理或信之教义，甚至在认识爱的教义方面胜过别人，却没有过良善的生活，因而没有出于对良善的渴望而坚持真理的人身上，甚至就会这样消散。<br />因此，教会之所以成为教会，不是凭脱离良善的真理，故而不是凭脱离仁的信，而是凭根植于良善的真理，或根植于仁的信。这一点还由主对雅各所说的话来表示：<br />我是伯特利的神，你在那里膏过柱子，在那里向我许过愿。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.13.htm">31:13</a>）<br />还有：<br />雅各立了一根石柱，在那上头奠酒、浇油。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.14.htm">35:14</a>）<br />“在柱子上奠酒”表示信的神性良善；“在那上头浇油”表爱的神性良善。谁能看出，若非表示某种属天和属灵之物，在石头上浇油就是一种荒诞的偶像崇拜行为。</p>

And poured oil upon the head of it. That this signifies holy good, is evident from the signification of "oil," as being the celestial of love, or good (see n. 886, 3009); and from the signification of 
the "head," as being that which is higher, or what is the same, that which is interior. That good is higher, or interior, and truth lower, or exterior, has been shown above in many places. From this 
it is evident what was signified by the ancient rite of pouring oil on the head of a pillar, namely, that truth should not be without good, but from good, thus that good should have the dominion as the 
head over the body; for truth without good is not truth, but is a sound void of life, and such that it is dissipated of itself. In the other life also it is dissipated with those who have excelled 
others in knowing truth or the doctrinal things of faith, and even the doctrinal things of love if they have not lived in good, and thus if they have not retained truth from good. [2] Hence the church 
is not a church from truth separate from good, consequently not from faith separate from charity; but from truth which is from good, or from faith which is from charity. The like is signified also by 
what the Lord said to Jacob: </p>
<p>     I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto Me (Gen. 31:13); </p>
<p>and by what is said again: </p>
<p>     Jacob set up a pillar of stone, 
and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon (Gen. 35:14); </p>
<p>by "pouring out a drink-offering on a pillar" is signified the Divine good of faith; and by "pouring oil" upon it, 
the Divine good of love. Everyone can see that to pour oil upon a stone, without the signification of something celestial and spiritual, would be ridiculous and idolatrous. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3728</b></p><p><b>3728.</b>
'And poured oil on the top of it' means holy good [in which it originated]. This is clear from the meaning of 'oil' as the celestial element of love, which is good, dealt with in <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, and from 
the meaning of 'the top' as that which is higher, or what amounts to the same, that which is interior - good being that which is higher or interior, and truth that which is lower or exterior, as has been 
shown in many places. From this one may see what was meant by the ancient practice when people poured oil on the top of a pillar, namely that truth should not be devoid of good but should be grounded 
in good, thus that good should rule, like the head on top of the body. For truth devoid of good is not truth but is a meaningless sound and the kind of thing that is reduced to nothing. In the next 
life it is so reduced even with those whose knowledge of truth or matters of doctrine concerning faith, and with those whose knowledge of matters of doctrine concerning love, has been superior to anybody 
else's, if they have not led a good life and so have not out of a desire for good held on to truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Consequently the Church is not the Church by virtue of truth separated from good, nor therefore 
by virtue of faith separated from charity, but by virtue of truth that is grounded in good, or faith that is grounded in charity. The same is also meant by what the Lord said to Jacob, </p>
<blockquote>
I am 
the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2031:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 31:13</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Also, </p>
<p>Jacob again set up a pillar, a stone pillar, and poured out a drink-offering over it, and poured oil 
over it. Gen. <a href="35.htm">35</a> :14. </p>
<p>'Pouring out a drink-offering over the pillar' means the Divine good of faith, and 'pouring oil over it' the Divine good of love. Anyone may see that unless it meant something 
celestial and spiritual, pouring oil over a stone would be a ridiculous and idolatrous action. </p>

</p><b>3728.</b>
`Et fudit oleum super caput illius': quod significet sanctum bonum, constat a significatione `olei' quod sit caeleste amoris seu bonum, de qua n. 886, 3009; ex significatione `capitis' quod sit id 
quod superius est, seu quod idem, id quod interius; </p>
<p>quod bonum sit superius seu interius, et verum sit inferius seu exterius, multis in locis ostensum est; inde patet quid per ritum illum antiquum 
quod fuderint oleum super caput statuae, significatum, quod nempe {1}verum non esset absque bono, sed ex bono, ita quod bonum dominaretur, sicut caput super corpus; verum enim absque bono non est 
verum, sed est sonus nullius vitae, et tale ut dissipetur ex se, {2}in altera vita dissipatur etiam apud illos qui prae aliis verum seu {3}doctrinalia fidei, etiam qui {3}doctrinalia amoris sciverunt 
si non in bono {4}vixerunt, ac ita si non ex bono verum retinuerint; [2] inde Ecclesia non est Ecclesia ex vero separato a bono, proinde non a fide separata a charitate, sed (c)a vero quod ex bono, 
seu (c)a fide quae ex charitate; etiam simile significatur per illa quae Dominus ad Jacobum dixit,      Ego Deus Bethelis, quo unxisti statuam, quo vovisti Mihi      votum,Gen. xxxi 13: </p>
<p>et per 
quod      Jacob iterum statuit statuam, statuam lapidis, et libavit      super illa libamen, et fudit super (c)illa oleum, Gen. xxxv      14; </p>
<p>per `libare libamen super statua' significatur Divinum 
bonum fidei, et per `fundere oleum super (c)illa' Divinum bonum amoris. Quod fundere oleum super lapidem, absque significatione alicujus rei caelestis ac spiritualis, foret quoddam ridiculum et 
idololatricum, quisque videre potest. @1 bonum esset ex quo verum$ @2 i quoque$ @3 vera$ @4 vixerint$ </p>
