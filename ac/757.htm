<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第757节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>757.</strong>“天上的水闸也敞开了”表涉及觉知之物的试探达到白热化。这一点从前面所述也清楚可知。涉及意愿之物的试探决不会脱离涉及觉知之物的试探，因为若脱离，根本就不会有任何试探，只有诸如存在于那些生活在恶欲之火中的人身上的洪水。他们在其中象地狱灵一样感受其生活的快乐。他们因着虚假或推理的泛滥而被称为“天上的水闸”。对此，以赛亚书上还说：<br />躲避恐惧声音的必坠入陷坑；从陷坑中间爬上来的必被网罗缠住，因为高天的水闸都开了，地的根基也震动了（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.18.htm">24:18</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]757.</strong> The symbolism of heaven's floodgates opened as the climax of their struggles over ideas in the intellect can be established by the same statements just made. Trials involving the urges of the will, or cravings, simply cannot be detached from trials involving concepts in the intellect. If the two were separated, there would be no struggle, only a deluge of the kind that overwhelms people who live amid the raging fire of their appetites, in which they find the core pleasure of their lives, as hellish spirits do.<br />The term heaven's floodgates comes from the flood of falsities or rationalizations that pours in, as portrayed also in Isaiah:<br />One fleeing because of a horrifying sound will fall into a pit, and one climbing out of the middle of the pit will be caught in a snare, because the floodgates in the heights opened and the foundations of the earth shook. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_757/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_18" target=_top>Isaiah 24:18</a>) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 757</b></p><p><b>757.</b>
The cataracts of heaven were opened. That this signifies the extreme of temptation as to things of the understanding, is also evident from the above. Temptation as to things of the will, or as to cupidities, 
can by no means be separated from temptation as to things of the understanding; for if separated there would not be any temptation, but an inundation, such as there is with those who live in 
the fires of cupidities, in which they, like infernal spirits, feel the delights of their life. They are called the "cataracts of heaven" from the inundation of falsities or reasonings; concerning which 
also in Isaiah: He who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the cataracts from on high are opened, 
and the foundations of the earth do shake (Isa. 24:18). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 757</b></p><p><b>757.</b>
'The floodgates of heaven were opened' means the full extent of temptation involving things of the understanding. This too is clear from what is said above. Temptation involving things of the will, which 
are evil desires, can never be separated from temptation involving those of the understanding. If it were separated, there would be no temptation at all but a deluge like that which occurs with those 
who lead lives amid the fires of evil desires, in which, like spirits of hell, they feel the delights of their lives. 'The floodgates of heaven' are so called from the deluge of falsities or reasonings, 
concerning which the following is also said in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He who is fleeing at the sound of the terror will fall into the pit; and he who is climbing out of the middle of the pit will be caught 
in the snare, for the floodgates from on high have been opened and the foundations of the earth have been shaken. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:18</a>. 
</blockquote>

</p><b>757.</b>
Quod 'cataractae caeli apertae' significent extremum tentationis quoad intellectualia, inde quoque constat; tentatio quoad voluntaria seu cupiditates nusquam potest separari a tentatione quoad intellectualia; 
si separaretur, non foret aliqua tentatio, sed inundatio qualis apud eos qui in cupiditatum incendiis vivunt, in quibus, sicut infernales spiritus, jucunda vitae suae percipiunt. 'Cataractae 
caeli' dicuntur ex inundatione falsorum seu ratiociniorum, de quibus etiam apud Esaiam, Fugiens prae voce pavoris cadet in foveam, et ascendens e medio foveae capietur in laqueo, nam cataractae ab 
alto apertae sunt, et commota fundamenta terrae, xxiv 18. </p>
