<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1642节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1642.</strong>这就是那时灵人所使用的言语；不过，天使灵的言语更普遍、更完美，而天使的言语还要更普遍、更完美。因为如前所述，天堂有三层，第一层是善灵所在之地，第二层是天使灵所在之地，第三层是天使所在之地。完美的等级也是这样逐层上升的，如同外在事物之于更内在之物。以对比来说明，这几乎就像听觉之于视觉，视觉之于思维。因为听觉通过言语在一个小时内所接受的东西，在视觉面前一分钟内就能呈现出来，如平原、宫殿和城市的景象。而眼睛在数小时内所看到的一切，在一分钟内就能被思维所理解。这就是灵人与天使灵的言语，以及天使灵与天使的言语之间的差别程度。因为天使灵在一个言语或思维的观念中所理解的，比灵人通过数千个观念所理解的还要清晰；而天使与天使灵相比也是如此。那么，主又会怎样呢？祂是情感、思维和言语的一切生命的源头，唯独祂是言语（Speech）和话语（Word）！</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1642.</strong> This, then, is the way spirits talk; but the speech of angelic spirits is even more universal and perfect, and the speech of angels still more so. There are three heavens, as noted before [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1642/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1642/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>]. Good spirits inhabit the first, angelic spirits the second, and angels the third. Perfection increases as it rises, so that superficial elements have almost the same relation to deeper ones as hearing (to illustrate by comparison) has to sight, and sight has to thought. What the ear can absorb from speech in an hour can be presented to the eye in a minute 钬?a panorama of fields, mansions, and cities, for instance. And what the eye takes many hours to observe, the thought can grasp in a minute. The speech of spirits bears the same ratio to that of angelic spirits, and the speech of angelic spirits to that of angels. Angelic spirits incorporate more clear, distinct concepts into one idea, spoken or thought, than spirits cover in several thousand; and angels outdo angelic spirits to the same degree. How must it be with the Lord, then, the source of all the life in our feelings, thoughts, and speech, the one who alone is the Message and the Word? </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1642</b></p><p><b>1642.</b>
This then is the speech of spirits; but the speech of angelic spirits is still more universal and perfect; and the speech of angels is more universal and perfect still. For there are three heavens, as 
before said; the first is where good spirits are, the second is where angelic spirits are, and the third is where angels are. The perfections thus ascend, as from exterior things to things more interior. 
To use a comparison for the sake of illustration, it is almost like hearing relatively to sight, and sight relatively to thought; for what the hearing can receive through speech in an hour, can 
be presented before the sight in a minute, as, for example, a view of plains, palaces, and cities and all that can be seen by the eye in many hours, can be comprehended by the thought in a minute. In 
such a ratio does the speech of spirits stand to the speech of angelic spirits, and the speech of angelic spirits to the speech of angels; for angelic spirits distinctly comprehend more in one idea of 
speech or thought, than spirits by several thousand; and so it is with angels in comparison with angelic spirits. How then must it be with the Lord, from whom is all the life of affection, thought, and 
speech, and who alone is the Speech, and the Word! </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1642</b></p><p><b>1642.</b>
Such then is the speech used by spirits; but the speech of angelic spirits is more universal and perfect still, while that of angels is even more universal and perfect than that; for, as stated already, 
there are three heavens, the first where good spirits are, the second where angelic spirits are, and the third where angels are. The degrees of perfection rise one above another in this way, as things 
that are more exterior do in relation to more interior, almost - to use a comparison that will enable this point to be seen - as hearing stands in relation to sight, and sight to thought. For that 
which hearing is able to take in through an hour of speech may be presented to the sight within a minute, such as for example, views of plains, palaces, and cities. And what may be beheld by the eye 
over many hours may be comprehended by thought within a minute. Such is the measure of difference between the speech of spirits and that of angelic spirits, and between the latter's speech and that of 
angels. For angelic spirits acquire a clearer understanding from one single idea comprising speech or thought than spirits do by means of several thousand; and the understanding of angels is similarly 
greater compared to that of angelic spirits. How must it be then with the Lord, who is the source of all the life of affection, thought, and speech, and who alone is Speech and the Word? </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1642</b>
</p><b>1642.</b>
Haec nunc est loquela spirituum, sed loquela spirituum angelicorum adhuc universalior et perfectior est; et loquela angelorum adhuc universalior et perfectior; nam tres caeli sunt, ut prius dictum; 
primum est ubi spiritus boni, secundum ubi spiritus angelici, et tertium ubi angeli; perfectiones ascendunt ita sicut exteriora se habent ad interiora, paene, ut ex comparatione sciatur, sicut auditus 
se habet ad virum, et visus ad cogitationem; nam quod per loquelam haurire potest auditus per horam, hoc potest coram visu sisti intra minutum, sicut, pro exemplo, prospectus campestrium, palatiorum, 
et urbium; et quod videri potest oculo per plures horas, hoc potest cogitatione comprehendi intra minutum; in tali ratione se habet loquela spirituum ad loquelam spirituum angelicorum, et loquela horum 
ad loquelam angelorum; spiritus enim angelici una idea loquelae aut cogitationis plus distincte comprehendunt quam spiritus per aliquot mille; et angeli similiter respective ad spiritus angelicos. 
 Quid tunc apud Dominum, a Quo omnis vita affectionis, cogitationis et loquelae, et Qui solus est Sermo et Verbum. </p>
