<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1443.</strong>至于“摩利橡树”是指最初直觉，情况是这样：人具有觉性、理性和知识；觉性形成其心智的至内在部分，理性形成内在部分，知识形成外在部分；所有这些都被称为他的属灵事物，也就是此处依次出现的事物。属天之人的觉性好比拥有各种树的园子；其理性好比拥有诸如黎巴嫩的香柏树及类似树种的森林；而其知识则好比橡树，因为橡树具有枝条缠错的特征。这些树本身表直觉；东边伊甸园的树表至内在的直觉，或觉性（如前所述<a href="99.htm">99</a>，<a href="100.htm">100</a>，<a href="103.htm">103</a>节），黎巴嫩森林里的树表内在直觉，或理性；而橡树表外在直觉，即属外在人的那些知识。正因如此，“摩利橡树”表主的最初直觉；因为祂还是个孩子，其属灵的力量尚未从内发展起来。此外，摩利橡树也是以色列人穿过约旦河、看见迦南地后首先到达的地方。对此，摩西书上说：<br />你就要将祝福的话陈明在基利心山上，将咒诅的话陈明在以巴路山上。这二山岂不是在约旦河那边、日落之处，住在与吉甲相对的平原的迦南人之地，靠近摩利橡树吗？（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.29.htm">11:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.30.htm">30</a>）<br />这些话也表直觉的最初体验，因为以色列人的进入就代表那些相信主国度之人的进入。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1443.</strong> In regard to the fact that the oak grove of Moreh is the dawn of perception, this is the situation: In us we have capacities for true understanding, for rationality, and for knowing facts. Capacities for true understanding are at the center, rational abilities are less central, and factual knowledge is on the outside. These abilities, in this arrangement, are called our spiritual assets.<br />In heavenly people, the ability to understand is compared to a garden filled with all kinds of trees. Rational capacities are compared to a forest of cedar and so on 钬?the kind of trees in Lebanon.{*1} But facts are like oak groves, since they resemble the tangled branches that oaks have. The trees themselves symbolize perceptions. The trees on the east in the Garden of Eden, for instance [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_8-9" target=_top>Genesis 2:8-9</a>], symbolize the deepest perceptions, or those that comprise true understanding, as already shown (搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_99" target=_top>99</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_100" target=_top>100</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_103" target=_top>103</a>). The trees in Lebanon's forest symbolize perceptions that are less deep, or the perception of rational concepts. The trees found in an oak grove, though, symbolize more superficial perceptions, or the perception of facts, which belong to the outer self. That is why the oak grove of Moreh symbolizes the dawn of perception in the Lord, since he was still young and did not yet have spiritual assets inside him.<br />In addition, the oak grove of Moreh was where the children of Israel first arrived after crossing the Jordan and saw the land of Canaan. Moses speaks of it this way:<br />You shall give the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. Are they not across the Jordan, beyond the path of the sunset, in the land where the Canaanite lives in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the oak groves of Moreh? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_11_29-30" target=_top>Deuteronomy 11:29-30</a>)<br />This too symbolizes the beginning of perception, since the entry of the children of Israel represents the entry of the faithful into the Lord's kingdom.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Lebanon is very frequently associated with forests and trees 钬?especially cedars 钬?in the Hebrew Bible. Examples are <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_19_23" target=_top>2 Kings 19:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_13" target=_top>Isaiah 60:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_16" target=_top>16</a>.

As regards "the oak-grove Moreh" being the first perception, the case is this. There are with man things intellectual, things rational, and things of memory [scientifica]; his inmost things are intellectual, 
his interior things are rational, and his exterior things are those of the memory [scientifica]; all these are called his spiritual things, which are in the order here given. The intellectual 
things of the celestial man are compared to a garden of trees of every kind; his rational things, to a forest of cedars and similar trees, such as there were in Lebanon; but his memory-knowledges [scientifica] 
are compared to oak-groves, and this from their intertwined branches such as are those of the oak. By trees themselves are signified perceptions; as by the trees of the garden of Eden eastward, 
inmost perceptions, or those of intellectual things (as before shown, n. 99, 100, 103) by the trees of the forest of Lebanon, interior perceptions, or those of rational things; but by the trees of 
an oak-grove, exterior perceptions, or those of memory-knowledges, which belong to the external man. Hence it is that "the oak-grove Moreh" signifies the Lord's first perception; for He was as yet a 
child, and His spiritual things were not more interior than this. Besides, the oak-grove Moreh was where the sons of Israel also first came when they passed over the Jordan and saw the land of Canaan, 
concerning which in Moses:       Thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, and the curse upon Mount Ebal. Are they not beyond Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land 
of the Canaanite that dwelleth in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the oak-groves of Moreh (Deut. 11:29-30); </p>
<p>by which also is signified the first of perception, for the entrance of the sons of Israel 
represents the entrance of the faithful into the Lord's kingdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1443</b></p><p><b>1443.</b>
The implications of a first perception being meant by 'the oak-grove of Moreh' are as follows: Residing with man there are intellectual concepts, rational concepts, and factual knowledge. The intellectual 
concepts form the inmost parts of his mind, the rational concepts form the interior parts, and the factual knowledge forms the exterior parts. They are called his spiritual endowments, which occur 
in the order in which they have been mentioned. The intellectual concepts of the celestial man are compared to 'a garden consisting of trees of every kind'; rational concepts to 'a forest consisting 
of cedars and other trees like them', such as those that grow in Lebanon; while factual knowledge is compared to 'oak-groves' on account of the interlocking boughs that are a feature of oak trees. The 
trees themselves meant perceptions - 'the trees of the garden of Eden in the east' meant inmost perceptions, that is, those of intellectual concepts, as shown already in <a href="99.htm">99</a>,<a href="100.htm">100</a>, <a href="103.htm">103</a>; 'the trees of 
the forest of Lebanon' meant interior perceptions, that is, those of rational concepts, whereas 'oak trees' meant exterior perceptions, that is, those of facts that belong to the external man. This explains 
why 'the oak- grove of Moreh' means the Lord's first perception, for He was still only a boy and His spiritual powers had not yet developed interiorly. In addition the oak-grove of Moreh was also 
the place which the children of Israel came to first when they crossed the Jordan and saw the land of Canaan. Of this it is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse 
on Mount Ebal. Are not these across the Jordan, beyond the road towards the seeing of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite who dwells in the plain towards Gilgal, beside the oak-groves of Moreh? 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2011:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 11:29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words as well mean the first experience of perception, for the entry of the children of Israel represents the entry of those who have faith into the Lord's kingdom. </p>

Quod prima perceptio sit 'quercetum Moreh,' ita se res habet:  sunt apud hominem intellectualia, rationalia et scientifica; intima ejus sunt intellectualia, interiora sunt rationalia, et exteriora sunt 
scientifica, haec appellantur ejus spiritualia, quae in tali ordine sunt; intellectualia hominis caelestis comparantur 'horto ex omnis generis arboribus'; rationalia 'silvae ex cedris et similibus 
arboribus' quales in Libano; scientifica autem 'quercetis,' et hoc ex ramis implexis quales sunt quercuum; per ipsas 'arbores' significatae sunt perceptiones, sicut per 'arbores horti Edenis ab oriente' 
perceptiones intimae seu intellectualium, ut ostensum prius n. 99, 100, 103; per 'arbores silvae Libani' perceptiones interiores seu rationalium; per 'arbores autem querceti' perceptiones exteriores 
seu scientificorum quae sunt externi hominis; inde est quod 'quercetum Moreh' significet primam perceptionem Domini, nam adhuc puer fuit et spiritualia Ipsius non interius. Praeterea quercetum Moreh 
erat ubi quoque filii Israelis primum venerunt cum transiverunt Jordanem et viderunt terram Canaanem, de quo apud Mosen, Dabis benedictionem super monte Gerizim, et maledictionem super monte Ebal. 
 Nonne illi trans Jordanem, post viam ingressus solis, in terra Canaanaei habitantis in planitie adversus Gilgal, juxta querceta Moreh?  Deut. xi 29, 30; </p>
<p>quibus significatur etiam primum perceptionis; 
introitus enim filiorum Israelis repraesentat introitum fidelium in regnum Domini. </p>
