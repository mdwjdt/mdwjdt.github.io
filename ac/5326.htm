<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5326节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5326.</strong>“我是法老”表属世层即源于此，或这使得属世层成为原本的样子。这从“法老”的代表清楚可知，“法老”是指属世层（参看<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>，<a href="5080.htm">5080</a>，<a href="5095.htm">5095</a>，<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>节）。“我是法老”表示属世层即源于此，或这使得属世层成为原本的样子，这一事实从接下来的话明显看出来。因为接下来的话，即“在埃及全地，若没有你，没有人可举手或抬脚”表示属世层的这两个部分的一切能力皆源于属灵层的属天层。而且由于接下来的话表示存在于属世层中的事物，故经上首先说“我是法老”。属世层这个词表示源于属灵层的属天层的属世层，或以属灵层的属天层为其源头的属世层。这一切含义如下：正被新造，即正经历重生之人的属世层完全不同于未经历重生之人的。未经历重生之人的属世层是一切事物；他思维和渴望的源头是一切事物，而不是理性层，更不是属灵层，或说他出于一切事物，而不是出于理性层，更不是出于属灵层思考和渴望，因为这些已封闭，大部分都灭绝或死亡了。<br />而对正经历重生的人来说，一切事物都变得属灵。属灵层不仅决定了属世层的思维和渴望，而且构成属世层，正如原因构成它的结果。因为在一切结果中，唯一起作用的，是原因。于是，属世层变得像属灵层，因为属世层中的属世之物，如源于自然界某种事物的知识或认知，凭自己什么也做不了；它们只是支持属世层，以便它能在属世层里面并通过属世层行动，因而在属世层面发挥作用。这正如结果里面的情形。结果里面的事物不会多过原因里面的；但这些事物所服务的唯一目的就是使原因在结果里面达成实际的结果，在结果那个层面使自己呈现在实际行为中。从这几句话可以看出已被新造，也就是重生之人的属世层是何情形。这就是“我是法老”所表示的“属世层即源于此，或这使得属世层成为原本的样子”的意思。</p>

I am Pharaoh. That this signifies that the natural is thence derived, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural (see n. 5079, 5080, 5095, 5160). That by "I am Pharaoh" is signified 
that the natural is thence derived, is plain from the words just below: "without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt," by which is signified that all the power 
in both naturals is from that source; and because things in the natural are meant by the words that follow, it is therefore first said "I am Pharaoh." By the natural being thence derived is meant 
that the natural is from the celestial of the spiritual. In regard to this the case is that the natural in the man who is being created anew, that is who is being regenerated, is entirely different from 
what it is in the man who is not being regenerated. The natural in the man who is not being regenerated is everything; from it the man thinks and desires, and not from the rational, still less from 
the spiritual, because these are closed and for the most part extinct.  [2] But in the man who is being regenerated the spiritual becomes everything, and not only disposes the natural in its thinking 
and desiring, but also determines the character of it, just as the cause determines the character of the effect; for in every effect the only thing that acts is the cause. Thus the natural becomes as 
the spiritual is for the natural things in the natural, such as the knowledges that derive somewhat from the natural world, do nothing from themselves; they merely agree that the spiritual should act 
in the natural, and by means of it, thus naturally; just as is the case in the effect, in which there are more things than in the cause, but only such as enable the cause to perform the effect itself 
in the effect, and to produce itself in act in that degree. From these few remarks it may be seen how the case is with the natural in the man who has been created anew, that is, regenerated. This is 
what is meant by the natural being thence derived, which is signified by "I am Pharaoh." </p>

'I am Pharaoh' means that this made the natural what it was. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural, dealt with in <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>, <a href="5080.htm">5080</a>, <a href="5095.htm">5095</a>, <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>. The fact that 'I am Pharaoh' means 
that this made the natural what it was is evident from all that immediately follows. For the declaration 'without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt' means that the 
celestial of the spiritual was the origin of all the power in both parts of the natural. Also, because things present in the natural are meant by the words that follow, the expression 'I am Pharaoh' 
therefore comes first, the term natural being used to mean the natural which has the celestial of the spiritual as its origin. The implications of this are as follows: With someone who is being created 
anew, that is, being regenerated, the natural is entirely different from what it is with someone who is not being regenerated. In the case of someone who is not being regenerated, his natural is everything; 
it is the source of his thought, and it is the source of his desires. His rational is not the source of it, and his spiritual still less so, because these are closed and for the most part dead. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
But in the case of someone who is being regenerated everything is made spiritual. The spiritual not only determines the thoughts and desires of the natural but also constitutes the natural 
in exactly the same way as a cause constitutes its effect; for nothing else acts within any effect except its cause. Thus the natural becomes like the spiritual, for the contents of the natural - such 
as any knowledge or cognition which springs from something in the natural world - do not act by themselves; they serve merely to support the spiritual so that it can act within and through the natural, 
and so act on the level of the natural. The same is so within an effect. An effect holds more things within itself than its cause does; yet the only purpose such things serve is to enable the cause 
to achieve the actual effect within the effect and to present itself in actual fact on the level of effect. From these few comments one may see what the natural is like in the case of a person who has 
been created anew, that is, regenerated - that regeneration, which made the natural what it was, being meant by 'I am Pharaoh'. </p>

</p><b>5326.</b>
`Ego Pharaoh': quod significet quod inde naturale, constat a repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale, de qua n. 5079, 5080, 5095, 5160; quod per `ego Pharaoh' significetur quod inde naturale, 
ex mox sequentibus patet; dicitur enim `praeter te non extollet vir manum suam et pedem suum in omni terra Aegypti', per quae significatur quod omne potentiae ab illo in utroque naturali, et quia {1}illa 
quae in naturali per sequentia illa verba intelliguntur, idcirco primum dicitur `ego Pharaoh', per inde naturale intelligitur quod ex caelesti spiritualis sit naturale; cum hoc ita se habet: naturale 
apud hominem qui e novo creatur, hoc est, qui regeneratur, prorsus aliud est quam apud hominem qui non regeneratur; naturale apud hominem qui non regeneratur, est omne; inde cogitat homo, et inde 
desiderat, non autem ex rationali, minus ex spirituali, quia haec (m)occlusa sunt, et quoad {2}maximam partem exstincta(n); [2] at apud hominem qui regeneratur, fit spirituale omne, hoc non modo disponit 
naturale ad cogitandum et ad desiderandum, sed etiam constituit naturale, prorsus sicut causa constituit effectum, in omni enim effectu nihil est quod agit quam causa; ita fit naturale sicut spirituale, 
naturalia enim quae ibi sunt, sicut scientifica et cognitiones quae ex naturali mundo aliquid trahunt, nihil ex se agunt, modo adstipulantur ut spirituale agat in naturali, et per illud, ac ita 
naturaliter; similiter ut {3}in effectu, in effectu sunt plura quam in causa, sed talia quae solum faciunt ut causa agere possit in effectu ipsum effectum, et se {4}in illo gradu actualiter producere; 
ex his paucis videri potest quomodo se habet cum naturali apud hominem qui e novo creatus est, hoc est, qui regeneratus; tale intelligitur per inde naturale, quod significatur per `ego Pharaoh'.   @1
