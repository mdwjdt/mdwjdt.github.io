<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2018节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2018.</strong>“我必在我与你之间坚立我的约”表联结。这从“立约”的含义清楚可知，前面说过，“立约”表结合（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>节）。本章和之前其它地方论述过这种结合，那里说明，耶和华，即此处的说话者，就在祂里面。因为主自孕育和出生的那刻起，就与祂为一。因为主从耶和华成孕，因此祂的内在就是耶和华。这一点可通过人里面的类似事物（<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>节）进一步予以说明。也就是说，人的灵魂与肉体为一，或内在与外在为一，尽管它们彼此截然不同，有时差别显着到这一个与另一个争战的地步，如试探中常见的情形。在试探中，内在会斥责外在，并渴望逐出外在里面的邪恶。然而，它们仍结合在一起，或构成一体，因为灵魂与肉体都属于那同一个人。以思维不同于外在表情、言谈、举止之人为例。对他来说，内在与外在不符，但这二者仍构成一体。因为正如外在表情、言谈、举止是人的一部分，这思维也是人的一部分。不过，当表情、言谈、举止与这思维一致时，联结就产生了。补充这些内容是为了说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2018</b></p><p><b>2018.</b>
I will set up My covenant between Me and thee. That this signifies union, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being union (explained before, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038); which union has 
been treated of in this chapter, and many times before; and it has been shown that Jehovah, who here speaks, was in the Lord, because He was one with Him from first conception and from birth; for the 
Lord was conceived from Jehovah, and hence His internal was Jehovah. This has been further illustrated by what is similar in man (n. 1999), namely, that his soul is one with his body, or his internal 
with his external, although they are distinct from each other, and sometimes so distinct that the one fights with the other, as is wont to be the case in temptations, in which the internal reproves 
the external and desires to reject the evil that is in it; and still they are conjoined, or are a one, because both soul and body belong to the same man. Take for example one whose thought differs from 
what he shows in his looks, speaks with his mouth, and acts by his gesture. There is in him an interior which is at variance with the external, but still they are one; for the thought is the man's as 
much as are the external looks, mouth, and gestures; but there is a union when the look, the speech of the lips, and the gestures accord with the thought. So much for illustration. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2018</b></p><p><b>2018.</b>
That 'I will establish My covenant between Me and you' means union is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as union, dealt with already in <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>. This union has been dealt with above 
in this chapter and in other places before that, where it has been shown that Jehovah who is the speaker here was within Him, because He was one with Him from the very start of conception and birth. 
For He was indeed conceived from Jehovah, and therefore His Internal was Jehovah. And in <a href="1999.htm">1999</a> this has been illustrated by the similarity that exists with man; that is to say, his soul is one with his 
body, or his internal one with his external, even though they are quite distinct and separate from each other. Sometimes they are so distinct that one is in conflict with the other, as normally happens 
in times of temptation when the internal reproaches the external and wishes to cast out the evil that is within the external; nevertheless they are joined together or are one since soul and body both 
belong to the same person. Take for example a person whose thought is something other than what is expressed in his looks, speech, and actions. In his case that which is more interior is at variance 
with that which is external; yet the two make one, for the thought is just as much part of that person as the external is to which looks, speech, and actions belong. Union exists however when the latter- 
looks, speech, and action - are in agreement with the thought. So much for these remarks added by way of illustration. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2018</b>
</p><b>2018.</b>
`Erigam foedus Meum inter Me et inter te': quod significet unionem, constat a significatione `foederis' quod sit unio, de qua prius n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, de qua unione in {1} hoc capite et prius 
passim actum est, et ostensum quod Jehovah Qui hic loquitur, fuerit in Ipso, quia unus cum Ipso a prima conceptione et nativitate, nam conceptus fuit {2} a Jehovah, et inde Internum Ipsius fuit Jehovah; 
et hoc per simile apud hominem illustratum (o)n. 1999, quod nempe anima ejus unum sit cum corpore, seu internum ejus cum externo, tametsi inter se distincta sunt; et quandoque ita distincta ut unum 
pugnet cum altero, ut fieri solet in tentationibus in quibus internum increpat externum et malum quod in externo, rejicere vult {3}, et usque conjuncta aut unum sunt, quia tam anima quam corpus est ejusdem 
hominis: sit pro exemplo qui aliter cogitat quam vultu ostendit, ore loquitur, et gestu facit; est tunc interius quod dissentit cum externo, sed usque unum sunt, nam cogitatio aeque hominis est 
ac externum vultus, oris [et] gestus; at unio est, quando haec, seu vultus, loquela oris et gestus, cum cogitatione consentiunt: haec ad illustrationem. </p>
