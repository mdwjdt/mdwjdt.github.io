<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9393.</strong>“摩西取了一半的血”表已经变成生命和敬拜之事的神性真理。这从“血”的含义清楚可知，“血”是指从主发出的神性真理（参看<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>节）。之所以表示已经变成生命和敬拜之事的神性真理，是因为这是摩西洒在百姓身上的血（24:8），这“血”表示人已经接受的神性真理，因而表示已经变成生命和敬拜之事的神性真理。因为已经变成生命，因而敬拜之事的真理可以说被人接受了。当这个人对真理拥有一种情感，或热爱它时，或也可说，当他意愿它，并出于意愿，因而出于爱和情感实行它时，它就成了生命和敬拜的事。在此之前，真理的确与他同在，就在他的记忆中，有时从那里被召唤出来，来到内视或理解力面前，从那里又回到他的记忆中。然而，只要神之真理仅止于此，不再更深地进入，虽与此人同住，却没有被植入生命和意愿；因为人的生命在于他的意愿。因此，当真理从记忆被召唤出来进入理解力，从理解力进入意愿，再从意愿出来进入行为时，这真理就变成此人生命的一部分，被称为良善。由此明显可知已经变成生命之事的神性真理是什么意思。成为敬拜的一部分的真理也一样。敬拜若源于只停留在记忆中，并由此出现在理解力中的真理，就不是敬拜。但敬拜若源于从意愿发出，因而从情感和爱发出的真理，就是敬拜。这种敬拜在圣言中被称为心里的敬拜，而前一种则仅仅是嘴上的敬拜。<br />前面所提到的章节的确早已说明，“血”表示从主发出的神性真理。然而，由于属当今教会的大多数人对圣餐中的血没有其它概念，只是认为它是主在十字架上所流的宝血，从更普遍的意义上说，是祂的整个十字架受难本身，所以可在此用几句话说明，圣餐中的血不是这个意思，而是指从主发出的神性真理。这一点在教会不为人知的原因是，如今人们对于对应一无所知，因而对于圣言的内义，就是世人阅读圣言时天使所理解的那层意义一无所知。<br />“血”不是指血，而是指神之真理，这一点从圣言中的许多经文可以看出来，从以西结书中的这段经文则看得更明显：<br />你要对空中的各类飞鸟和田野的各种走兽说，你们聚集来吧！要从四方聚集来赴我为你们献上的祭筵，好叫你们吃肉喝血。你们必吃勇士的肉，喝地上首领的血。你们必从我为你们献上的祭筵，吃脂肪吃到饱足，喝血直到醉了。你们必在我席上饱吃马匹和战车，并一切的战士。我必这样在列族中彰显我的荣耀。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.17.htm">39:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>）<br />很明显，“血”在此不是指血液，因为经上说他们“必喝地上首领的血，祭筵的血，直到醉了”；然而，喝血，尤其喝首领的血是可憎恶的事，经上以死刑来禁止以色列人做这种事（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.17.htm">3:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.26.htm">7:26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.17.htm">17</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.17.htm">12:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.23.htm">15:23</a>）。经上还说，他们“必饱吃马匹和战车，并一切的战士”。因此，人若不知道“血”表示神性真理，“首领”表示首要真理，“祭筵”表示属于敬拜的事物，“马匹”表示对真理的理解，“战车”表示教义，“战士”表示与虚假争战的真理，必对这段经文的细节感到困惑不解。<br />这段话与主在约翰福音中的话是一样的：<br />耶稣说，我实实在在地告诉你们：你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。吃我肉喝我血的人就有永生，在末日我要叫他复活。我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。吃我肉、喝我血的人住在我里面，我也住在他里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.53.htm">6:53</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.56.htm">56</a>）<br />可参看前面关于这些话的说明（<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>节）。肉对应于良善，和饼一样；血对应于真理，和酒一样；我已经多次从天上被告知这一事实。我还被告知，天使只根据对应关系来理解圣言；以这种方式人类通过圣言与天堂联结，并通过天堂与主联结。<br />我同样被告知，主设立圣餐，是为了天堂的一切，也就是主的一切能通过它与教会成员联结。因为在圣餐中，肉或饼是指主对全人类的神性之爱的神性良善，以及人回给主的爱；而血或酒是指从主的神性之爱的神性良善发出的神性真理，以及人反过来对它的接受。此外，在天堂，吃与喝这些恩赐意味着把它们变成自己的，并将它们联结起来。不过，关于这个主题，可参看前面的说明（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>，<a href="6789.htm">6789</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>节）。</p>

And Moses took half of the blood. That this signifies Divine truth that has been made of the life and of worship, is evident from the signification of "blood," as being the Divine truth that proceeds 
from the Lord (see n. 4735, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127). That the Divine truth which has been made of the life and of worship is signified, is because it was the blood that Moses sprinkled on the people 
(verse 8), by which "blood" is signified Divine truth received by man, thus which has been made of the life and of worship. For that truth is said to be received by man which has been made of the 
life and thus of worship; and it has become of the life and of worship when the man is affected by it, that is, loves it, or what is the same thing, wills it, and from willing does it from love and 
affection. Until this is the case, truth is indeed with man in his memory, and is sometimes called forth thence to the internal sight or understanding, from which it again falls back into the memory. 
But so long as truth Divine has not entered more interiorly, it is indeed with man, but still it is not implanted in the life and will; for the life of man is his will. And therefore when truth is called 
forth from the memory into the understanding, and from the understanding enters the will, and from the will goes forth into act, then the truth becomes of the man's life, and is called good. From 
all this it is evident what is meant by Divine truth being made of the life. It is the same with the truth that is made of the worship. Worship from truth that cleaves to the mere memory, and from this 
appears in the understanding, is not worship. But worship from truth that goes forth from the will, thus from affection and love, is worship. This worship is called in the Word worship "from the heart," 
but the former is worship "of the mouth" only.  [2] It has indeed already been shown, in passages cited above, that "blood" denotes the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. But as many of the 
church at this day have no other conception of the blood in the Holy Supper than of the blood of the Lord shed on the cross; and in a more general sense, the passion itself of the cross; it may here 
be shown in a few words that it is not blood which is there meant, but the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. The reason why this is unknown within the church, is that at the present day nothing 
whatever is known about correspondences, consequently nothing about the internal sense of the Word, which is the sense in which the angels are when the Word is read by man. [3] That "blood" does 
not denote blood, but truth Divine, can be seen from many passages in the Word, and plainly from this in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Say to the bird of every wing, and to every wild animal of the field, Be ye assembled, 
and come; assemble yourselves from around upon My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the strong ones, and drink the blood of 
the princes of the earth. Ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood unto drunkenness, of My sacrifice that I will sacrifice for you. Ye shall be sated upon My table with horse and chariot, and with 
every man of war. Thus do I set My glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17-21). That by "blood" is not here meant blood, is very evident, for it is said that they "shall drink the blood of the princes 
of the earth, and the blood of the sacrifice, even unto drunkenness," when yet to drink blood, and especially the blood of princes, is an abominable thing, and was forbidden the sons of Israel under 
the penalty of death (Lev. 3:17; 7:26; 17; Deut. 12:17-26; 15:23). It is also said that they "shall be sated with horse, chariot, and every man of war." He therefore who does not know that "blood" signifies 
Divine truth; "princes," primary truths; a "sacrifice," the things of worship; a "horse," the understanding of truth; a "chariot," doctrine; and a "man of war," truth fighting against falsity; 
must be amazed at the details of this passage. [4] In like manner at the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His 
blood, ye will have no life in you. He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. 
He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him (John 6:53-56). But see what has been already said about these words in n. 4735, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127. That flesh 
corresponds to good, in like manner bread; and that blood corresponds to truth, in like manner wine; has very often been told me from heaven; as also that the angels perceive the Word no otherwise than 
according to correspondences; and that in this way man has conjunction with heaven through the Word, and through heaven with the Lord. [5] In like manner I have been told that the Holy supper was 
instituted by the Lord in order that by it there might be a conjunction of all things of heaven, that is, of all things of the Lord, with the man of the church; because in this supper the flesh and the 
bread denote the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love toward the whole human race, and man's reciprocal love to the Lord; and the blood and the wine denote the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine 
good of the Lord's Divine love, and this received in turn by man; and in heaven to eat and drink these things denotes appropriation and conjunction. (But see what has been already shown on this subject 
in n. 2165, 2177, 3464, 4211, 4217, 4581, 4735, 5915, 6789, 7850, 9323.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9393</b></p><p><b>9393.</b>
'And Moses took half of the blood' means Divine Truth which has become a matter of life and of worship. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blood' as Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, dealt with 
in <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>. The reason why it is Divine Truth which has become a matter of life and of worship is that it was the blood which Moses sprinkled over the people, verse 8, and 
this blood means Divine Truth which a person has accepted, thus that which has become a matter of life and of worship; for that Truth is said to have been accepted by a person which becomes a matter 
of life and so of worship. And it becomes a matter of life and worship when the person has an affection for it or loves it, or what amounts to the same thing, when he wills it, and - in willing it, and 
so in loving and having an affection for it - does it. Till then it is indeed present with him in his memory, and is at times called forth from there and comes before his inward sight or understanding, 
from where it passes back into his memory. However, as long as God's truth goes no deeper than this, though it resides with the person it has not been implanted in his life and will; for a person's 
life consists in his will. Therefore when truth is called forth from the memory into the understanding, then passes from the understanding into the will, and goes out from the will into action, that 
truth becomes part of the person's life and is called good. All this shows what is meant by Divine Truth which has become a matter of life. The situation is the same with truth which becomes part of 
worship. Worship springing from truth which does no more than cling in the memory and make its appearance from there in the understanding is not worship. But worship springing from truth that goes out 
from the will, and so from affection and love, is worship. In the Word this worship is called worship of the heart, but the other, worship of the lips alone.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It has indeed been shown already 
in the places referred to above that 'blood' means Divine Truth emanating from the Lord. Nevertheless since the majority belonging to the Church at the present day take the blood in the Holy Supper to 
mean nothing other than the Lord's blood that was shed on the Cross, and in a more general sense His whole Passion of the Cross, let something further be stated briefly to show that blood is not what 
is meant there but Divine Truth emanating from the Lord. The reason why this is unknown within the Church is that nothing whatever is known at the present day about correspondences, nor consequently 
about the internal sense of the Word, the sense understood by angels when someone in the world reads the Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It becomes clear from many places in the Word that 'blood' does not mean blood but 
God's truth, and plainly so from the following in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Say to every bird of the air and to every wild animal of the field, Assemble and come, gather yourselves from all around to My sacrifice 
which I am sacrificing for you, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood. You will eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. You will eat fat till you are glutted, 
and drink blood till you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I will sacrifice for you. You will be glutted at My table with horse and chariot, and with every man of war. Thus will I set My glory among 
the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2039:17-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 39:17-21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It is plainly evident that 'blood' is not used here to mean blood, for it says that they were going to drink the blood of the princes of the earth, and the blood from 
the sacrifice, till they were drunk, when yet drinking blood, especially the blood of princes, is something abominable and was forbidden to the children of Israel on pain of death, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%203:17;%207:26;%2017:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 3:17; 7:26; 17:1-end</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2012:16-25;%2015:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 12:16-25; 15:23</a>. It also says that they were going to be glutted with horse, chariot, and every man of war. Anyone therefore who does not know that 'blood' means Divine Truth, 'princes' 
leading truths, 'sacrifice' the things that belong to worship, 'horse' the understanding of truth, 'chariot' doctrinal teachings, and 'man of war' truth engaged in conflict against falsity is bound 
to be bemused by each of the words used in this passage. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 His response would be the same to the Lord's words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son 
of Man and drink His blood, you will have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise Him up at the last day. My flesh is truly food, and My blood is 
truly drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:53-56&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:53-56</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>But see what has been shown already regarding these words, in <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>. 
The fact that flesh corresponds to good, as does bread, and that blood corresponds to truth, as does wine, has been told me very many times from heaven. I have likewise been told that angels understand 
the Word solely according to correspondences, and that as a result of this mankind is joined by means of the Word to heaven, and through heaven to the Lord. </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 And in like manner I have been told that 
the Holy Supper was established by the Lord to be the means by which all things of heaven, that is, all things which are the Lord's, might be joined to members of the Church. For in the Holy Supper 
the flesh or bread is the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Love towards the whole human race, and a person's love in return to the Lord, while the blood or wine is the Divine Truth emanating from the 
Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Love, and in turn the person's acceptance of it. In heaven, furthermore, eating and drinking those gifts implies making them one's own and joining them together. But 
see what has been shown already regarding these matters in <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>, <a href="6789.htm">6789</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9323.htm">9323</a>.  </p>

`Et accepit Moscheh dimidium sanguinis': quod significet Divinum Verum quod factum vitae et cultus, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' quod sit Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, de qua n. 4735, (x)6978, 
7317, 7326, 7850, 9127; quod sit Divinum Verum quod factum vitae et cultus, est quia erat ille sanguis quem Moscheh sparsit super populum, vers. 8, per quem sanguinem significatur Divinum Verum 
receptum ab homine, ita quod factum vitae et cultus; nam id Verum dicitur receptum ab homine quod fit vitae et sic cultus; et tunc fit vitae et cultus quando homo afficitur illo, seu amat illud, seu, 
quod idem est, vult illud, et ex velle, ita ex amore et affectione, facit illud; prius quidem est apud hominem in ejus memoria, et inde evocatur quandoque ad visum internum seu intellectum, a quo iterum 
relabitur in memoriam; sed quamdiu verum Divinum non interius intraverat, est quidem apud hominem {1}at usque non implantatum {2}vitae et voluntati, nam vita hominis est ejus voluntas; quapropter 
cum verum evocatur e memoria in intellectum, et ab intellectu intrat voluntatem, et a voluntate exit in actum, tunc {3}verum fit vitae hominis et vocatur bonum; ex his patet quid intelligitur per Divinum 
Verum factum vitae; similiter se habet cum {4}vero quod fit cultus; cultus {5}ex vero quod solum haeret in memoria et inde apparet in intellectu, non est cultus, sed cultus ex vero quod exit ex voluntate, 
ita ex affectione et amore, est cultus; hic cultus in Verbo vocatur cultus ex corde: ille autem cultus solius oris. 2 Ostensum quidem est prius in locis supra citatis quod `sanguis' sit Divinum 
Verum procedens a Domino; sed quia plerique ab Ecclesia hodie non aliud per sanguinem in Sancta Cena capiunt quam sanguinem Domini effusum super cruce, et in generaliore sensu ipsam passionem crucis, 
ideo licet adhuc paucis ostendere quod non {6}sit sanguis qui ibi intelligitur sed Divinum Verum procedens a Domino; causa quod {7}hoc intra Ecclesiam ignoretur, est quia prorsus nihil scitur hodie 
de correspondentiis, consequenter nec de sensu interno Verbi, qui est sensus in quo sunt angeli cum ab homine legitur Verbum; 3 quod `sanguis' non sit sanguis sed verum Divinum, constare potest (c)ex 
pluribus locis in Verbo, et manifeste ab hoc apud Ezechielem, Dic avi omnis alae et omni ferae agri, Congregamini et venite, congregate vos a circuitu super sacrificium Meum quod Ego sacrifico vobis, 
{8}ut comedatis carnem, et bibatis sanguinem; carnem fortium comedetis, et sanguinem principum terrae bibetis; comedetis adipem ad satietatem, et bibetis sanguinem usque ad ebrietatem de sacrificio 
Meo quod {9}sacrificabo vobis; satiabimini super mensa Mea, equo et curru, et omni viro belli; sic dabo gloriam Meam inter gentes, xxxix 17-20 [, 21]; </p>
<p>quod non sanguis hic per `sanguinem' intelligatur, 
manifeste patet, nam dicitur quod biberent sanguinem principum terrae, et sanguinem de sacrificio, usque ad ebrietatem, cum tamen bibere sanguinem, et imprimis sanguinem principum, sit res abominabilis, 
et filiis Israelis sub poena mortis prohibitus, Lev. iii 17, vii 26, xvii 1-fin.; Deut. xii (x)16-25, xv 23; dicitur etiam {10}quod satiarentur equo, curru, et omni viro belli; qui itaque non 
scit quod `sanguis' significet Divinum Verum, `principes' primaria vera, `sacrificium' {11}illa quae cultus sunt, `equus' {12}intellectuale veri, `currus' doctrinam, et `vir belli' verum pugnans contra 
falsum, obstupesceret ad singula verba ibi: similiter 4 ad Domini verba apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Amen, amen, dico vobis, Nisi comederitis carnem Filii hominis et biberitis Ejus sanguinem, non habebitis 
vitam in vobis; qui manducat Meam carnem et bibit Meam sanguinem, habet vitam aeternam, et Ego resuscitabo illum extremo die; caro Mea est vere cibus, et sanguis Meus est vere potus; qui manducat 
Meam carnem et bibit Meum sanguinem, in Me manet, et Ego in illo, vi 53-56; </p>
