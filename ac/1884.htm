<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1884节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong> 1884.</strong>关于另一种异象，就是“神游”（即被灵带到别的地方）。通过亲身经历，我也得知何为“神游”，它是如何发生的。不过这样的经历我仅有两三次，我就说说其中一次。当时，我走过城市的街道，穿过郊外的田野，全神贯注地与灵人交谈。我只知道我是完全清醒的，眼睛看得分明，行走也没有差池。在此过程中，我一直是在异象当中。我看见树林、河流、宫殿、房屋、百姓，等等。但以这种方式走了几个时辰后，我突然回到肉眼的视觉当中，发现自己到了另一个地方。我对此惊讶万分，意识到自己是经历了经上所说他们“被灵带到别的地方”（“神游”）的状态。在那过程中，时间和距离都不在考虑当中，虽然它可能持续几个时辰甚至几天，走过许多公里的路程。我也不觉得疲倦。就这样，人可能被引领走过未知的路程，毫无差池地被引到某个预定的地方。这一切的发生是为了让我知道，主能在人不知不觉的情况下把他引到他所来或要去的地方。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1884.</strong> As for the second kind of vision — being led by the spirit into another place — what it is and what it involves has been shown to me by living experience. But this has happened only two or three times. Let me cite a single instance.<br />Strolling city streets and country meadows while at the same time talking with spirits, I had no idea I was not as fully awake and aware as I am at any other time. I walked along like this without losing my way, and all the while I was having a vision, seeing woods, rivers, mansions, homes, people, and so on. After I had walked around this way for several hours, I suddenly found myself seeing with my physical eyes and realized I was somewhere else, which utterly astounded me. I perceived that I was experiencing the state of those who are said to have been led by the spirit to another place. While it is happening, you do not stop to think about the route, no matter how many miles long. You also fail to think about the time, no matter how many hours or days. Neither do you notice feeling at all tired. You are being led by paths you do not know until you reach the destination.<br />This happened so that I would also be able to see that we can be led by the Lord without knowing why or where. </p>

As regards the other kind of vision-being carried away by the spirit into another place-it has been shown me by living experience what it is, and how it is done, but only two or three times. One single 
experience I may mention. Walking through the streets of a city and through the country, and being at the same time also in conversation with spirits, I did not know but that I was wide awake and saw 
as at other times, so that I walked on without mistake, and all the time being in vision, seeing groves, rivers, palaces, houses, men, and many other things. But after I had thus walked for hours, 
suddenly I was in the sight of the body, and became aware that I was in another place. Greatly amazed at this, I perceived that I had been in such a state as they were in of whom it is said that they 
were "led away by the spirit into another place;"* for while this state lasts there is no reflection concerning the way, even if it be many miles; nor is there reflection concerning the time, even if 
it be many hours or days; nor is there any feeling of fatigue. Moreover the person is led through ways of which he has no knowledge, even to the appointed place. This took place that I might know that 
a man can be led by the Lord without his knowing whence and whither. * See 1 Kings 18:12; 19:8; Ezek. 3:12, 14; Acts 8:39. </p>

In the case of the second - described by 'carried away by the spirit into another place'- I have been shown what it is and what it is like through actual experience, but only two or three times, of which 
let merely one experience be described. Walking through the streets of a city and through countryside, and being at the same time engaged in conversation with spirits, I knew no other than that I 
was fully awake and seeing things as at other times, so that I walked on without going astray. Yet during all that time I was in a vision, seeing groves, rivers, palaces, houses, people, and many other 
things. But after I had walked for several hours in this fashion I suddenly found myself seeing with my physical eyes, and I realized that I was in another place. In my utter astonishment I recognized 
that I had been in the kind of state experienced by people who are said to have been 'carried away by the spirit into another place', for while it all lasts no thought is given to the route that is 
taken, even though it were one of many miles. Nor is any thought given to the time involved, even though it were a matter of many hours or days. Nor are there any feelings of tiredness. Furthermore 
that person is led along paths unknown to him until the destination is reached. This happened to me so that I might know that the Lord can lead a person without his knowing where he has come from or is 
going to. </p>

</p><b>1884.</b>
Quod alterum attinet, 'a spiritu in alium locum auferri,' ostensum est mihi per vivam experientiam quid sit et quomodo se habet; sed hoc solum bis et ter; solam experientiam licet afferre. Per plateas 
urbis et per campestria ambulans, tUnc quoque in loquela cum spiritibus, non aliter scivi quam qua ita vigil essem et videns sicut aliis temporibus, ita ambulans absque error et interea in visione 
eram, videns lucos, fluvios, palatia, domus, homine et plura; sed postquam ita per horas ambulavi, subito eram in visu corpori et animadverti quod in alio loco essem, quo obstupefactus valde appercepi 
quod in tali statu fuerim in quo illi, de quibus dicitur quod 'abducti spiritu in alium locum,' nam dum perstat, nihil reflectitur super viam, et hoc si vel foret plurium miliarium; nec reflectitur super 
tempus, si vel foret plurium horarum sive dierum; nec fatigatio ulla percipitur; tunc quoque ducitur per vias quas ipse ignorat, usque ad locum designatum.  Hoc factum ut quoque scirem quod a Domino 
duci queat homo, praeter quod sciat unde et quo. </p>
