<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7136节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7136.</strong>“以色列人的官长受责打”表那些最近距离地接受并传递侵扰之人被所引入的虚假伤害。这从“受责打”和“官长”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知。“受责打”是指被虚假伤害，因为责打的是“督工”，而“督工”表示侵扰者；事实上，就灵义而言，“受责打”不是指被打，而是指在真理与良善方面，也就是构成属灵生命的事物方面受到伤害，正如“死”在灵义上不是指死亡，而是指被剥夺真理和良善，陷入虚假和邪恶，因而受到诅咒一样。“官长”是指那些最近距离地接受并传递侵扰之人（参看<a href="7111.htm">7111</a>节）；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节），“官长”所表示的那些人就是要将东西传递给他们。</p>

And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten. That this signifies that they who most closely received and communicated the infestations were injured by the injected falsities, is evident from the 
signification of "being beaten," as being to be injured by falsities, because by the taskmasters, by whom are signified the infesters, for in the spiritual sense "to be beaten" is not to be beaten, 
but to be injured in respect to truth and good, that is, in respect to the things of spiritual life; just as "to die" in the spiritual sense is not to die, but to be deprived of truth and good, and to 
be in falsity and evil, and therefore damned; from the signification of "the officers," as being those who most closely receive and communicate the infestations (see n. 7111); and from the representation 
of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637), with whom they who are signified by the "officers" were in communication. </p>

'And the officers of the children of Israel were beaten' means that those in the nearest position to receive molestations and pass them on suffered harm from the falsities that had been introduced. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'being beaten' - since the beating was done by 'the taskmasters', by whom those who molest are meant - as suffering harm from falsities (for 'being beaten' does not in 
the spiritual sense mean being beaten, but suffering harm in respect of truth and good, that is, in respect of the things that compose spiritual life, just as 'dying' does not in the spiritual sense 
mean dying but being deprived of truth and good, being governed by falsity and evil, and therefore being subject to damnation); from the meaning of 'the officers as those in the nearest position to receive 
molestations and pass them on, dealt with in <a href="7111.htm">7111</a>; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>, to whom those meant 
by 'the officers' were to pass things on. </p>

`Et percussi sunt moderatores filiorum Israelis': quod significet quod illi qui proxime infestationes receperunt et communicarunt ex injectis falsis laesi sint, constat ex significatione `percuti' quod 
quia ab exactoribus, per quos significantur infestatores, {1} sit laedi a falsis, nam `percuti' in spirituali sensu non est percuti sed quoad verum et bonum, hoc est, quoad illa quae sunt vitae spiritualis, 
laedi; sicut `mori' in spirituali sensu non est mori, sed deprivari vero et bono, ac in falso et malo esse, et ideo damnari; et ex significatione `moderatorum' quod sint qui proxime infestationes 
recipiunt et communicant, de qua n. 7111; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 6426, 6637, cum quibus communicarunt illi qui per `moderatores' 
significantur. 	@1 i quod$ </p>
