<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4267节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4267.</strong>“又吩咐领头的说，我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候，问你说，你是谁的人？要往哪里去？你前头这些是谁的？你就说，是你仆人雅各的；这是送给我主以扫的礼物，看哪，他也在我们后边”表交付。这同样从这几句话的内义清楚可知，大体上的意思就从这些话显现出来。很明显，所表示的是交付和涉及交付的事物；因为雅各吩咐他的仆人称呼他哥哥为“主”，称呼他自己为“仆人”，还吩咐仆人说，这礼物是如同仆人送给他主人的。良善相对来说是主人，真理相对来说是仆人，然而它们仍被称作“弟兄”，这在前面已多次说明。它们之所以被称作“弟兄”，是因为良善与真理已经结合，良善在真理里面如同在一个形像里面显明自身，之后它们便联合行动以产生效果。不过，在它们结合之前，尤其在哪一个优先的问题上仍存在争议之时，良善就被称作“主人”，真理被称作“仆人”。</p>

And he commanded the first, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? Then thou shalt say, Thy servant 
Jacob's; this is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and behold he also is behind us. That this signifies submission, is evident in like manner from the internal sense of the several words, from which 
this general sense results. That this is submission, and that things relating to submission are signified is manifest; for he commanded his servants to call his brother "lord," and himself "servant," 
and to say that a present was sent as by a servant to his lord. That good is relatively a lord, and truth relatively a servant, and that they are nevertheless called "brethren," has been shown many 
times. They are called "brethren" because when good and truth have been conjoined, good is then presented in truth as in an image, and they afterwards act in conjunction to produce the effect. But good 
is called "lord" and truth "servant" before they have been conjoined, and still more so when there is a dispute about the priority. </p>

'And he commanded the first, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong; and where are you going; and whose are these in front of you? then you shall say, They 
belong to your servant Jacob; it is a gift sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us' means submission. This likewise is clear from the internal sense of individual words, from which this 
general meaning emerges. Submission and what goes with submission is clearly the meaning, for Jacob commanded his servants to call his brother 'lord' and himself 'servant', and to say that the gift 
was being sent as if to a lord from his servant. It has been shown many times that in relation to each other good is 'lord' and truth 'servant', and also that they are nevertheless called 'brothers'. 
They are called 'brothers' because when good and truth have been joined together, good manifests itself within truth as in an image, and after that they act conjointly to bring about the effect. But good 
is called 'lord' and truth 'servant' before they have been joined together, the more so when there is argument over which one has priority over the other. </p>

`Et praecepit primo, dicendo, Quod occurrerit tibi Esau frater meus, et interrogaverit te, dicendo, Cui tu, et quo vadis, et cui illa ante te? et dices, Servo tuo Jacobo, munus hoc missum domino 
meo Esavo, et ecce etiam is post nos': quod significet submissionem constat pariter a sensu interno singulorum verborum, ex quo communis hic sensus resultat; quod submissio sit et quod illa quae submissionis, 
significentur, patet; praecepit enim servis ut fratrem suum vocarent dominum et se servum, et quod munus sicut domino a servo mittatur {1} quod bonum sit respective `dominus' et verum respective 
`servus,' e quoque quod usque dicantur `fratres,' multoties ostensum est; (m)fratres dicuntur quia cum conjuncta sunt {2} bonum et verum, (o)quod tunc bonum sistatur in vero, ut in imagine, 
et quod dein conjunctim agant ad producendum effectum; </p>
<p>bonum autem `dominus' dicitur et verum `servus' antequam conjuncta sunt, et magis cum disceptatur de prioritate.(n)      @1 ei mitteretur$
