<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第789节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>789.</strong>此处，该教会成员的摇摆不定首先被描述为“水（即虚假）往上长”；然后被描述为它们“浮起方舟”；进一步被描述为“把它从地上漂起”；之后被描述为“水势浩大，在地上大大地往上长”；最后被描述为“方舟漂浮在水面上”。不过，要解释摇摆的各个程度太过冗长，而且也没必要。知道此处描述的是它们就足够了。我们只是提一下“方舟从地上漂起，漂浮在水面上”这句话的含义。没人能知道它的含义，除非他被告知人如何从恶与假中被拦阻。由于这是一个奥秘，故必须简要解释一下。一般来说，每个人，包括重生之人，乃是这样：若主不从恶与假中拦阻他，他必一头栽入地狱。一不拦阻他，他就朝那个方向猛冲进去。我通过实际经历得知这一点，而且这一幕还在我面前表现为一匹马（对此，参看<a href="187.htm">187</a>-<a href="188.htm">188</a>节）。从恶与假中的这种拦阻无非是一种提升，以便觉察恶与假，因为它们在下，而人自己在上。关于这种提升，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。这种提升就是“方舟从地上漂起，漂浮在水面上”所表之义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]789.</strong> The details here portray the faltering of the people in this church. First the waters — falsities — grew, then they lifted the ark and it rose off the earth. Next the water strengthened and increased greatly on the earth, and finally the ark went on the face of the water. But describing the different stages of vacillation would be both tedious and useless. It is enough to know they are depicted here. All that needs explaining is the meaning of the phrases it rose off the earth and it went on the face of the water. The symbolism is not evident to anyone who has not learned how we are held back from evil and falsity. Since this is unknown I must explain it briefly.<br />All people in general, and even those who are regenerate, are such that unless the Lord held them back from evil and falsity they would throw themselves headlong into hell. At any moment that we are not withheld, we rush there precipitately, as I have discovered through various experiences. The horse mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_789/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_187" target=_top>187</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_789/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_188" target=_top>188</a> also represented this.<br />To be held back in this way is no different from being lifted up or rising, so that the evil and falsity are perceived as being below and the person above. More about such elevation will come later, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} This lifting up or rising is what the ark symbolized in rising off the earth and going on the face of the water.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On this spiritual elevation, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_789/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1044:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_789/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1857#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1857:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_789/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2116#subsection-2-2" target=_top>2116:2</a>.

The fluctuations of the man of this church are described here; first, by its being said that the "waters (that is, falsities) increased;" then, that they "bare up the ark" and that it was "lifted up 
from off the earth;" afterwards, that the "waters were strengthened, and increased greatly upon the  and finally, that the "ark went upon the face of the waters." But to explain each degree of the fluctuation 
would be too prolix, and unnecessary. It is sufficient to know that they are here described. We will merely mention what is signified by the statement that the ark was lifted up from off the 
earth, and went upon the face of the waters. As no one can know this unless he is informed how man is withheld from evils and falsities, and as this is a hidden thing, it shall be briefly explained. Speaking 
generally, every man, even the regenerate, is such that if the Lord did not withhold him from evils and falsities he would cast himself headlong into hell. The very moment he is not withheld, 
he rushes headlong into it. This has been made known to me by experience, and was also represented by a horse (as before described, n. 187, 188). This withholding from evils and falsities is in effect 
a lifting up, so that evils and falsities are perceived below, and the man above. Concerning this elevation, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. It is this elevation which is signified by the "ark 
being lifted up from off the earth, and going upon the face of the waters." </p>

The waverings of the member of this Church are described here first of all by the waters, that is, falsities, increasing; then by their raising the ark; further still by its being lifted above the earth; 
after that by the waters growing more and more and increasing greatly over the earth; and finally by the ark going over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the waters. It would however take far too long and it would be 
superfluous to describe individual waverings. It is sufficient just to know that they are being described here. Let merely the statement be considered that the ark was lifted above the earth and went 
over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the waters. Its meaning becomes clear to no one unless he has been told about how a person is withheld from evils and falsities. This being an arcanum it must be described briefly. 
Everyone in general, including a regenerate person, is such that unless the Lord withholds him from evils and falsities he hurls himself headlong into hell. The moment he is not being withheld he rushes 
headlong in that direction. This has been made known to me through actual experiences, and has also been represented to me by a horse, about which see <a href="187.htm">187</a>, <a href="188.htm">188</a>. This withholding from evils and falsities 
is nothing other than 'a lifting up' so that evils and falsities are perceived as being beneath, and man himself above. This lifting up will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. It 
is what is meant by the statements about the ark being lifted above the earth and about the ark going over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the waters.

Fluctuationes hominis hujus Ecclesiae describuntur hic per quod 'primum creverint aquae,' hoc est, falsa; tum quod 'sustulerint arcam'; adhuc quod 'elevata sit desuper terra'; dein quod 'corroboratae 
aquae et auctae valde super terra'; demum quod 'iverit arca super faciebus aquarum'; sed singulos fluctuationis gradus describere, et prolixum nimis et supervacaneum foret; satis est quod sciatur, hic 
describi illos; solum quid significet quod 'arca elevata sit desuper terra, et iverit super faciebus aquarum,' quod constare nemini potest nisi sit instructus quomodo homo a malis et falsis detinetur; 
hoc quia arcanum est, paucis describendum: omnis homo in genere, tum quoque regeneratus, talis est ut nisi Dominus detineat eum a malis et falsis, quod se praecipitem conjiciat in infernum, et quo 
momento non detinetur, praeceps ruit; quod per experientias mihi notum factum, et repraesentatum quoque per equum, de quo videatur, n. 187, 188: haec detentio a malis et falsis non aliter se habet ac 
'elevatio,' sic ut mala et falsa percipiantur infra, et is supra; de qua elevatione, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: haec elevatio est quae significatur per 'arcam quod elevata sit desuper 
terra' et quod 'iverit arca super faciebus aquarum.' </p>
