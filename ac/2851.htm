<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2851节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2851.</strong>“你的种必得着仇敌的城门”表仁与信必在先前恶与假所占据的地方取而代之。这从“得着”、“种”、“城门”和“仇敌”的含义清楚可知：“得着”（inheriting）是指从主接受生命（参看<a href="2658.htm">2658</a>节），在此是指取而代之，因为当仁与信存在于先前恶与假所占据的地方时，主的生命就会进入那里；“种”是指仁与信（参看<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>，<a href="1941.htm">1941</a>节）；“城门”的含义将在下文予以解释；“仇敌”是指恶与假，或也可说，那些处于恶与假之人，就圣言的内义而言，这些人由“仇敌”和“敌人”来表示。<br />关于“城门”的含义。总的来说，每个人都有两扇门：一扇朝地狱打开，并向由此而来的恶与假敞开；地狱的恶魔和恶灵就在这扇门内。另一扇朝天堂打开，并向由此而来的善与真敞开；天使便在这扇门内。因此，一扇门通往地狱，一扇门通往天堂。地狱之门向那些沉浸于恶与假之人敞开，天上的光只能从头顶上四围的缝隙透进来，使他们能思考和推理。但天堂之门向那些沉浸于由此而来的善与真之人敞开。<br />引入人理性心智的路径有两条：善与真沿着较高或内在路径从主进入；而恶与假沿着较低或外在路径从地狱偷偷上来。理性心智则在中间，这两条路径都到此会合。在圣言中，理性心智因其里面的善与真而被比作一座城，也如此被称呼。由于它好比一座城，也被如此称呼，故它有城门，经上经常描述城门被仇敌，就是恶魔与恶灵围困和攻击，但却被主的天使，就是主所保卫。地狱来的恶魔与恶灵及其恶与假只能到较低或较外在的城门，根本无法进入城内。若他们真能进入城内，也就是进入理性心智，那么所有人就全都完了。他们若真到了那一步，以至于在他们自己看来，他们似乎通过攻击占领了那城，这时，它就会关闭。因此，除了如前所述，有少量的光透过四围的缝隙进入外，善与真不再从天上流入它里面。正因如此，这种人不再拥有任何仁，也不再拥有任何信，而是将良善置于邪恶，将真理置于虚假。也正因如此，他们不再具有真正的理性，尽管他们自己觉得有理性（<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>，<a href="1944.htm">1944</a>节）。他们由此被称为死人，尽管他们自以为他们比谁都有活力（<a href="81.htm">81</a>，<a href="290.htm">290</a>节末尾）。这些事确实如此，因为天堂之门向他们关闭了。天堂之门向他们关闭的事实在来世是非常明显的，并被觉察到。而另一方面，天堂之门则向那些处于善与真之人敞开。<br />关于“仇敌的城门”，尤其本节所提到的。对世人来说，这城门就存在于他的属世心智中。当人完全属世，或尚未重生时，那城门就被恶与假所占据；或也可说，恶魔与恶灵，连同恶欲与谬念就流入它里面（参看<a href="687.htm">687</a>，<a href="697.htm">697</a>，<a href="1692.htm">1692</a>节）。但当人变得属灵，或正在重生时，那么恶与假，或也可说，恶魔与恶灵就从那城门，也就是属世心智被驱离；然后，善与真，或仁与信取而代之；这些事物（即仁与信）就是“你的种必得着仇敌的城门”所表示的。这一切尤其会发生在正经历重生的每个人身上，同样发生在来世那些进入主国度的人身上；并且还总体上发生，也就是发生在由许多个体组成的教会中。<br />这种转变由以色列人逐出迦南地的各个民族来代表。就字义而言，逐出这些民族就是“你的种必得着仇敌的城门”所表示的；但就内义而言，所表示的则是刚才所说的这些事。这也解释了为何在古代，人们在祝福那些即将步入婚姻的人时，习惯说这句话。这从拉班对他妹子利百加的祝福明显看出来，那时，她正要离去，到与其订婚的以撒那里去：<br />我们的妹子啊，愿你作千万人的母！愿你的种得着那仇恨你之人的城门！（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.60.htm">24:60</a>）<br />在圣言中，“仇敌的城门”或那些仇恨之人的城门就表示这类事物。这从以下经文可以看出来，以赛亚书：<br />我必以饥荒治死你的根，我必杀戮你所余剩的人。门哪，应当哀号！城啊，应当呼喊！非利士，你们众人啊，你都熔化了！因为有烟从北方出来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.30.htm">14:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.31.htm">31</a>）<br />“以饥荒治死你的根，杀戮所余剩的人”表拿走主从内在所储存起来的良善与真理。“所余剩的人”表这类良善与真理（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>-<a href="562.htm">562</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="798.htm">798</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节）。“门”表进入内层或理性心智的地方。“城”表那心智，或也可说，表它里面的良善与真理（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）；“非利士”表信之认知的记忆知识，或也可说，表那些拥有这些认知的记忆知识，却没有信之良善的人（<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>节）。“北方出来的烟”表来自地狱的虚假，“烟”表由邪恶产生的虚假（<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />荒凉的城拆毁了，各家关门闭户，使人都不得进去。在街上因酒有呼喊之声，一切喜乐变为凄凉，地上的欢乐都遭放逐。城中剩下的只是荒凉，城门拆毁净尽。因为这样它必在地的中间，在万民之中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.10.htm">24:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“荒凉的城拆毁了”表丧失真理的人类心智。 “各家关门闭户”表没有良善，“家”表良善（参看<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>节）。“在街上因酒有呼喊之声”表虚假的状态，“呼喊”论及虚假（<a href="2240.htm">2240</a>节）。“酒”表真理，由于真理荡然无存，故才会有呼喊之声（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>节）。“街”表通向真理的事物（<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）。“变为凄凉的喜乐”论及真理，“遭放逐的地上欢乐”讼及良善。所有这一切表明“城中剩下的只是荒凉，城门拆毁净尽”这句话是什么意思。当只有恶与假掌权时，经上就说城门被“拆毁”了。<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />锡安的路径，因无人来守圣节就悲伤。她的城门凄凉，她的祭司叹息，她的处女受艰难，自己也愁苦。她的对头成了首领，她的仇敌亨通。因耶和华为她许多的罪过使她受苦，她的孩童在敌人面前沦为俘虏。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.4.htm">1:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“锡安的路径就悲伤”表那里不再有出自良善的任何真理，“路径”表真理（参看<a href="189.htm">189</a>，<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。“城门凄凉”表所有入口都被虚假占据。“对头成了首领”表邪恶掌权。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华使锡安女子的堡垒和城墙都悲哀；它们一同衰败。她的门都陷入地内，主将她的门闩毁坏折断。她的君王和首领落在没有律法的列族中；她的先知不得见耶和华的异象。你的仇敌都向你张口。他们嗤笑，又切齿说，我们吞灭她，这真是我们所盼望的日子临到了！我们等到了，我们看到了！（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.8.htm">2:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“门都陷入地内”表被恶与假所占据的属世心智。“她的君王和首领落在列族中”表真理被浸没于邪恶中，“君王”表总的真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节），“首领”表首要的真理（<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>节），“列族”表邪恶（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>，<a href="1868.htm">1868</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）。<br />摩西书：<br />从远方地极来的一族，必将你围困在你各城门内，在你的全地内；因此你的仇敌必围困你。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.49.htm">28:49</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.52.htm">52</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.53.htm">53</a>）<br />这些灾祸就在摩西向那百姓所预言的咒诅当中，因他们不守诫命和律例。“从远方地极来的一族”在内义上表示恶与假，或那些沉浸于恶与假之人。“围困在各城门内”表切断通向善与真的一切途径。<br />那鸿书：<br />看哪，你的人民在你中间简直是妇人；你国土的门户都向仇敌敞开着；你的门闩被火焚烧。你要打水预备受困，要坚固你的堡垒，踹土和泥，修补砖窑。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.13.htm">3:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“你国土的门户都向仇敌敞开着”表邪恶占据了良善理应所在的地方。士师记：<br />大道无人行走，他们沿小路行走，沿弯曲的道行走，以色列的农村消失了。他选择新神，交战的事就临到城门；以色列四万人中岂能见盾牌枪矛呢？（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.6.htm">5:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这是底波拉和巴拉的预言，“交战的事就临到城门”表对良善与真理的攻击。<br />诗篇：<br />坐在城门口的谈论我，酒徒也以我为歌曲。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.12.htm">69:12</a>）<br />“坐在城门口的”表邪恶与虚假，也表那些来自地狱的人。以西结书：<br />他在神的异象中，带我到朝北的内城门的门口。他在那里看见以色列家所行的大可憎的事。他还领我到耶和华殿朝北的城门的门口；他在那里也看见了可憎的事。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.3.htm">8:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“朝北的内城门的门口”表内在虚假所在地方。“耶和华殿朝北的城门的门口”表内在邪恶所在地方。邪恶与虚假是内在的，这类恶灵和恶魔就居于这内在区域（参看<a href="2121.htm">2121</a>-<a href="2124.htm">2124</a>节）。<br />诗篇：<br />看哪，儿女是耶和华所赐的产业，腹中的胎儿是祂的赏赐。少年时所生的儿女，好像勇士手中的箭。箭袋装满了箭的人是有福的，他们在城门口和仇敌说话的时候，必不至于羞愧。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.3.htm">127:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“在城门口和仇敌说话”表不惧怕邪恶与虚假，因而不惧怕地狱。以赛亚书：<br />到那日，万军之耶和华必作在位上行审判者公平之灵，并城门口打退仇敌者的力量。这些人也因酒迷迷忽忽，因浓酒东倒西歪。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.5.htm">28:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.7.htm">7</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />用一句话就定人罪的必被剪除，为城门口责备人的设下网罗；用虚无的事转脸不顾义人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.20.htm">29:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.21.htm">21</a>）<br /><br />以拦带着箭袋，还有坐战车的和马兵；吉珥揭开盾牌。你嘉美的谷遍满战车和马兵，都摆在城门前列阵，那日，他就仰望林库内的军器。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.6.htm">22:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.8.htm">8</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />犹大悲哀，其城门衰败，他们坐在地上哀悼，耶路撒冷的哀声上达；他们的贵胄打发家僮打水，他们来到池边，见没有水。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.2.htm">14:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.3.htm">3</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />老年人在城门口断绝；少年人不再奏乐。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.14.htm">5:14</a>）<br />由上述经文可以看出“仇敌的城门”表示什么，也就是说，表示地狱，或不断攻击善与真的地狱灵。如前所述，他们在人身上的座位就在他的属世心智中。但当人具有这样的秉性，即他允许良善与真理，因而允许天使进入时，主就会将这些地狱灵从那座位上赶走。一旦他们被赶走，天堂之门，或天堂本身就被打开了。这门也在圣言各处被提及，如以赛亚书：<br />在犹大地人必唱这歌：我们有坚固的城。耶和华要将救恩定为城墙、为外郭。你敞开城门，使守信的正义民族得以进入。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.1.htm">26:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.2.htm">2</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华对祂所膏的古列如此说，我搀扶他的右手，使列族降服在他面前。我也要放松列王的腰带，使门户在他面前敞开，使城门不得关闭。我必在你前面行，修直崎岖之地。我必打破铜门，砍断铁闩。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.1.htm">45:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.2.htm">2</a>）<br /><br />外邦人必建筑你的城墙，他们的王必服事你。他们必时常打开你的城门，昼夜不关；你地上不再听见强暴的事，境内不再听见荒凉毁灭的事。你必称你的墙为‘拯救’，称你的门为‘赞美’。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.10.htm">60:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.18.htm">18</a>）<br /><br />你们要过去，从城门过去；预备百姓的路；你们要修平，修平大道；你对锡安的女子说，看哪，你的救恩来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.10.htm">62:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.12.htm">12</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />他们直闯过城门，从城门出去。他们的王在他们前面行，耶和华在他们起头。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥2.13.htm">2:13</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />众城门哪，你们要抬起头来！永久的门户，你们要被举起！那荣耀的王将要进来。荣耀的王是谁呢？就是强而有力的耶和华，在战场上大有能力的耶和华。众城门哪，你们要抬起头来！永久的门户，你们要把头抬起！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.7.htm">24:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />耶路撒冷啊，你要颂赞耶和华！锡安哪，你要赞美你的神！因为祂坚固了你的门闩，赐福给你中间的儿女。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.12.htm">147:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.13.htm">13</a>）<br />由上述经文明显可知，“天堂之门”就是天使与人同在的地方，也就是善与真从主所流入的地方。因此，如前所述，有两扇门。对于这两扇门，主在马太福音中如此说：<br />你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡的，那门阔，那路宽，由它进去的人也多；引到生命的，那门窄，那路狭小，找着的人也少。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.12.htm">7:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.14.htm">14</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.23.htm">13:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.24.htm">24</a>）<br />此外，在以西结书和约翰的启示录，经上大量论述了新耶路撒冷的门和新圣殿的门，这些门无非表示进入天堂的入口（参看以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.6.htm">40:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.49.htm">49</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.1.htm">43:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.4.htm">4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.1.htm">44:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.1.htm">46:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.31.htm">48:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.34.htm">34</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.12.htm">21:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.25.htm">25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.14.htm">22:14</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.11.htm">54:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.12.htm">12</a>）。因此，耶路撒冷被称为“人民的城门”（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥1.9.htm">1:9</a>；俄巴底亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.13.htm">1:13</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2851</b></p><p><b>2851.</b>
And thy seed shall inherit the gate of thine enemies. That this signifies that charity and faith shall succeed in the place where evil and falsity were before, is evident from the signification of "inheriting," 
as being to receive the Lord's life (see n. 2658); here, to succeed in the place, because when charity and faith are in the place where evil and falsity were before, then the Lord's life succeeds 
there; from the signification of "seed," as being charity and faith (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1941); from the signification of a "gate" (explained in what follows); and from the signification 
of "enemies," as being evils and falsities, or what is the same, those who are in evil and falsity: in the internal sense of the Word these are signified by "enemies" and "foes."  [2] As regards the 
signification of a "gate," there are in general two gates with every man; the one opens toward hell, and is opened to the evils and falsities therefrom; in this gate are infernal genii and spirits; the 
other gate opens toward heaven, and is opened to good and the truths therefrom; in this gate are angels. There is thus a gate which leads to hell, and a gate which leads to heaven. The gate of hell 
is opened to those who are in evil and falsity, and only through chinks round about above does anything of the light from heaven enter, by means of which they are able to think and reason; but the gate 
of heaven is opened to those who are in good and the truth therefrom.  [3] For there are two ways which lead into man's rational mind-a higher or internal one, through which good and truth from the 
Lord enter, and a lower or external one, through which evil and falsity come up from hell. The rational mind itself is in the middle, and to it these ways tend. That mind, from the goods and truths which 
are in it, is compared in the Word to a city, and is called a "city." And because it is compared to a city, and is called a "city," gates are attributed to it, and it is often described as being 
besieged and stormed by enemies, that is, by evil genii and spirits; and as being defended by angels from the Lord, that is by the Lord. The infernal genii and spirits, with their evils and falsities, 
cannot come further than to the lower or outer gate, and in no case into the city. If they could get into the city, or into the rational mind, all would be over with the man. But when they come so far 
as to seem to themselves to have taken that city by storm, it is then closed, so that good and truth no longer flow into it from heaven except as was said some little through chinks round about. From 
this it is that such persons no longer have anything of charity or anything of faith, but make good consist in evil, and truth in falsity. From this also it is that they are no longer truly rational, 
although they seem to themselves to be so (n. 1914, 1944). And it is from this that they are called dead men, although they believe that they are more alive than others (n. 81, 290 at the end). These 
things are so because the gate of heaven is closed to them. That it is closed to them manifestly appears and is perceived in the other life; as also on the other hand that the gate of heaven is open 
to those who are in good and truth.  [4] As regards the "gate of enemies" in particular, which is treated of in this verse, it is with man in his natural mind. When man is wholly natural, or not regenerate, 
evils and falsities occupy the gate; or what is the same, evil genii and spirits flow into it with cupidities of evil and persuasions of falsity (see n. 687, 697, 1692); but when man becomes 
spiritual, or is being regenerated, then the evils and falsities, or what is the same, the evil genii and spirits, are driven away from the gate, or from the mind; then goods and truths, or charity and 
faith, take their place; which things are signified by its being said, "thy seed shall inherit the gate of thine enemies." This takes place in particular with every man when he is being regenerated; 
and in like manner in the other life with those who come into the Lord's kingdom; and it also takes place in the general body, or in the church, which is composed of many.  [5] This was represented 
by the sons of Israel expelling the nations from the land of Canaan. The latter is meant in the literal sense where it is said, "thy seed shall inherit the gate of thine enemies;" but in the internal 
sense are signified the things which have been told. Hence in ancient times it became customary to speak thus when blessing those who were entering into marriage; as is also manifest from the benediction 
of Laban to his sister Rebekah, when she was going away betrothed to Isaac: </p>
<p>     Our sister, be thou thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed inherit the gate of those that hate thee (Gen. 24:60).  
    [6] That such things are signified in the Word by the "gate of enemies" or of "those that hate," may be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will kill thy root with famine, 
and I will slay them that remain of thee. Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou art melted away, O Philistia, all of thee, for there cometh a smoke out of the north (Isa. 14:30-31); </p>
<p>to "kill the root with 
famine, and to slay them that remain," denotes to take away the goods and truths which had been stored up interiorly by the Lord. That "they that remain" mean these, may be seen above (n. 468, 530, 560-562, 
661, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284). The "gate" denotes access to the interiors, or to the rational mind; the "city," that mind, or what is the same, the goods and truths in it (n. 402, 2268, 2450, 
2451, 2712); "Philistia" denotes the memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith, or what is the same, those who are in the memory-knowledge of them, but not in the goods of faith (n. 1197, 1198); 
"a smoke out of the north" signifies that there is falsity from hell (that "smoke" is falsity from evil, may be seen above, n. 1861).  [7] In the same: </p>
<p>     The city of emptiness shall be broken down, 
every house shall be shut up that no one may come in; there is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all gladness shall be desolated, the joy of the land shall be exiled, that which is left 
in the city shall be desolation, and the gate shall be smitten with devastation, for thus shall it be in the midst of the earth, among the people (Isa. 24:10-13); </p>
<p>the "city of emptiness which shall 
be broken down" denotes the human mind as being deprived of truth; that "every house shall be shut up," denotes being without good (that a "house" is good, may be seen above, n. 2233, 2234; the "crying 
in the streets because of the wine" denotes a state of falsity (that a "cry" is predicated of falsities, may be seen above, n. 2240; also that "wine" is truth, of which the cry is that there is none, 
n. 1071, 1798; that "streets" are what lead to truths, n. 2336); "gladness which is desolated" is predicated of truth; the "joy of the land which is exiled" is predicated of good; hence it is manifest 
what is signified by "that which is left in the city shall be desolation," and by "the gate shall be smitten with devastation;" the gate is said to be "devastated" when nothing but evils and falsities 
reign.  [8] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the appointed feast; all her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is 
in bitterness; her adversaries have become the head, her enemies are secure, because Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions; her children are gone into captivity before the 
adversary (Lam. 1:4-5); </p>
<p>"the ways of Zion mourning" denotes there being no longer truths from good (that "ways" are truths, may be seen above, n. 189, 627, 2333); "all the gates being desolated" denotes 
that all the approaches are occupied by falsities; "the enemies having become the head" denotes that evils reign.  [9] In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath made the rampart and the wall of the daughter 
of Zion to lament; they languish together; her gates are sunk into the earth; He hath destroyed and broken her bars; her king and her princes are among the nations; the law is not; yea her prophets 
found no vision from Jehovah; all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee; they hissed and gnashed the teeth; they said, We have swallowed her up; surely this is the day that we looked for; 
we have found, we have seen it (Lam. 2:8-9, 16); </p>
<p>"the gates sunk down into the earth" denotes the natural mind occupied by evils and falsities; "her king and her princes being among the nations" denotes 
that truths are immersed in evils (that a "king" is truth in general, may be seen above, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069; also that "princes" are primary truths, n. 1482, 1089; and that "nations" are 
evils, n. 1259, 1260, 1849, 1868, 2588).  [10] In Moses: </p>
<p>     A nation from far, from the end of the earth, shall straiten thee in all thy gates, in all thy land; thus shall thine enemy straiten thee 
(Deut. 28:49, 52, 63). This is among the curses which Moses foretold to the people if they should not remain in the precepts and statutes: a "nation from far from the end of the earth," in the internal 
sense, denotes evils and falsities, or those who are in evil and falsity; to "besiege in all the gates" denotes cutting off all access to good and truth.  [11] In Nahum: </p>
<p>     Behold, thy people 
in the midst of thee are women, the gates of thy land are set wide open to thine enemies, the fire hath devoured thy bars; draw thee water for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay and 
tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln (Nahum 3:13-14); </p>
<p>"the gates of thy land being set wide open to thine enemies" denotes that evils occupy the place where there should be goods. In the book 
of Judges: </p>
<p>     The highways ceased, and they walked through byways, they went through crooked ways, the villages ceased in Israel. He chose new gods; then was war against the gates; was there a shield 
seen or a spear in forty thousands of Israel? (Judg. 5:6-8); </p>
<p>the prophecy of Deborah and Barak; there being "war against the gates" denotes against goods and truths.  [12] In David: </p>
<p>     They 
that dwell in the gate plot against me, they that drink strong drink sing songs (Ps. 69:12); </p>
<p>"they that dwell in the gate" denotes evils and falsities, and also the infernals. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     In the 
visions of God he brought me to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north. (He there saw the great abominations of the house of Israel.) He also brought me to the door of the gate of 
the house of Jehovah that looketh toward the north; he there also saw abominations (Ezek. 8:6, 14-15); </p>
<p>     "the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north" denotes the place where interior 
falsities are; "the door of the gate of the house of Jehovah toward the north" denotes the place where interior evils are (that the falsities and evils are interior ones, and that it is an interior 
sphere in which such spirits and genii are, may be seen above, n. 2121-2124).  [13] In David: </p>
<p>     Lo, sons are a possession of Jehovah, and the fruit of the womb is His reward; as arrows in the hand 
of a mighty man, so are sons of the youth. Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them; they shall not be ashamed, for they shall speak with the enemies in the gate (Ps. 127:3-5); </p>
<p>"to speak 
with the enemies in the gate" denotes to have no fear of evils and falsities, and thus not of hell. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day shall Jehovah Zebaoth be for a spirit of judgment to Him that sitteth 
in judgment, and for strength to them that turn back the battle to the gate; and these also are insane through wine, and through strong drink are gone astray (Isa. 28:5-7). In the same: </p>
<p>     They 
shall be cut off that make men to sin by a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate; and make the just to turn aside to a thing of naught (Isa. 29:20-21). In the same: </p>
<p>     Elam bare 
the quiver in a chariot of a man, and horsemen; Kir uncovered the shield; and the choice of thy valleys was full of chariots and horsemen; placing they placed themselves at the gate, and he looked in 
that day to the armory of the house of the forest (Isa. 22:6-8). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Judah hath mourned, and the gates thereof languished; they have mourned to the earth, and the cry of Jerusalem is 
gone up; their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters; they came to the pits, they found no waters (Jer. 14:2-3). In the same: </p>
<p>     The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from 
their music (Lam. 5:14). [14] It may be seen from these passages what is signified by the "gate of enemies," namely, that it is hell, or infernal spirits, who are continually attacking goods and truths. 
Their seat with man as before said is in his natural mind. But when a man is of such a character as to admit goods and truths, and thus angels, the infernal spirits are then driven away by the Lord 
from that seat; and on their being driven away, the gate of heaven or heaven itself is opened. This gate is also mentioned in the Word in various places; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     A song in the land of 
Judah. We have a strong city, salvation will He appoint for walls and bulwarks; open ye the gates, and the righteous nation that keepeth fidelities shall enter in (Isa. 26:1-2). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thus 
said Jehovah to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut; 
I will go before thee, and will make the crooked places straight, and I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron (Isa. 45:1-2). In the same: </p>
<p>     The sons of 
the stranger shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; they shall open thy gates continually, they shall not be shut day nor night; violence shall no more be heard in thy land, 
wasting and destruction within thy borders; and thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise (Isa. 60:10-11, 18). In the same: </p>
<p>     Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way 
for the people, level, make level the highway; say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh (Isa. 62:10-12). In Micah: </p>
<p>     They shall pass through the gate, and shall go out thereat, 
and their King shall pass on before them, and Jehovah in their beginning (Micah 2:13). In David: </p>
<p>     Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory 
shall come in. Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; lift them up, ye everlasting doors (Ps. 24:7-10).      Praise Jehovah, 
O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion: for He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates, He hath blessed thy children within thee (Ps. 147:12-13). [15] From these passages it is manifest that the "gate 
of heaven" is where angels are with man, that is, where there is an influx of good and truth from the Lord; and thus that as before said there are two gates. Concerning these two gates the Lord speaks 
thus in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Enter ye in by the strait gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat; because strait is the gate and narrow 
is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it (Matt. 7:12-14; Luke 13:23-24). Moreover the gates to the New Jerusalem and the gates to the new temple are much treated of in Ezekiel, 
and also by John in Revelation, by which nothing else is meant than the entrances to heaven (see Ezek. 40:6-49; 43:1-2, 4; 44:1-3; 46:1-9, 12; 48:31-34; Rev. 21:12-13, 21, 25; 22:14; Isa. 54:11-12). 
Hence Jerusalem is called the "gate of the people" (Micah 1:9; Obad. verse 13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2851</b></p><p><b>2851.</b>
'Your seed will inherit the gate of their enemies' means that charity and faith will take the place occupied previously by evil and falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'inheriting' as receiving 
the Lord's life, dealt with in <a href="2658.htm">2658</a>, here as taking the place of, for when charity and faith exist in the place occupied previously by evil and falsity, the Lord's life enters in there; from the meaning 
of 'seed' as charity and faith, dealt with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, <a href="1941.htm">1941</a>; from the meaning of 'gate', dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'enemies' as evils and falsities, or what amounts to the 
same, people who are subject to evil and falsity. It is the latter who are meant by enemies and foes in the internal sense of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the meaning of 'a gate', there are in general 
two gates with each individual person. One gate is exposed towards hell and is open to evils and falsities from there. In that gate genii and spirits from hell are present. The other gate is exposed 
towards heaven and is open to goods and truths from there. In that gate angels are present. Thus there is a gate leading to hell and a gate leading to heaven. The gate to hell is open to those who are 
immersed in evil and falsity, and only through chinks round about overhead does any light at all from heaven penetrate, which enables them to think and to reason. But the gate to heaven is open to those 
who are immersed in good and truth from there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For there are two paths which lead into a person's rational mind, a higher or internal path along which good and truth from the Lord enter in, 
and a lower or external path along which evil and falsity enter in surreptitiously from hell. In the middle is the rational mind towards which the two paths converge. From the goods and truths present 
there the rational mind is compared in the Word to a city and is actually called a city. And because it is compared to and actually called a city it is depicted as having gates, and is described in 
various places as having enemies, that is, evil genii and spirits, besieging it and assaulting it, while angels from the Lord are defending it, that is, the Lord Himself is doing so. The genii and spirits 
from hell, with their evils and falsities, can go no further than towards the lower or outer gate, and cannot pass at all into the city. If they were able to pass into the city, which is the rational 
mind, man would be completely done for. But when they reach the point, as it seems to them, that they have taken the city by storm, it is then closed, so that good and truth no longer flow into 
it from heaven, apart, as has been stated, from that small amount which comes in through chinks round about. As a consequence such persons no longer possess any charity at all or any faith at all, but 
make good consist in evil, and truth in falsity. They also as a consequence cease to be truly rational, though they seem to themselves to be so, <a href="1914.htm">1914</a>, <a href="1944.htm">1944</a>, and are called 'dead men', though they themselves 
believe they are more alive than any others, <a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="290.htm">290</a> (end). These things are so because the gate to heaven is closed to them. The fact that it is closed to them is quite apparent and is discerned 
in the next life, and so conversely that the gate to heaven is open to those in whom good and truth are present.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards 'the gate of enemies' in particular, spoken of in this verse, it 
is the gate that exists with a person in his natural mind. That gate when the person is wholly natural or as yet unregenerate is occupied by evils and falsities, or what amounts to the same, evil genii 
and spirits are flowing into it together with evil desires and false persuasions, see <a href="687.htm">687</a>, <a href="698.htm">698</a>, <a href="1692.htm">1692</a>. When however a person is spiritual or being regenerated, evils and falsities, or what amounts to 
the same, evil genii and spirits, are driven away from that gate, that is, from the natural mind. Once they have been driven away, goods and truths, or charity and faith, take their place; and these 
- charity and faith - are meant by 'your seed will inherit the gate of their enemies'. This is what takes place in particular with each individual person when he is being regenerated, and similarly in 
the next life with those entering the Lord's kingdom; and also what takes place in general, that is, in the Church, which is made up of many individuals. </p>

 This transformation was represented by 
the children of Israel driving the nations from the land of Canaan. Such expulsion of those nations is what, in the literal sense, the words 'your seed will inherit the gate of their enemies' are used 
to mean; but in the internal sense the things which have just been described are meant. This also explains why in ancient times it was customary to use words such as these when blessing persons who 
were about to be married, as is also evident from the blessing which Laban gave to Rebekah his sister when, already betrothed, she was about to go to Isaac,  </p>
<blockquote>
Our sister, may you be [the mother] of 
thousands of myriads, and may your seed inherit the gate of those who hate you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:%2060&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24: 60</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That such things are meant in the Word by 'the gate of enemies' or 'of those who hate' becomes clear 
from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will I slay. Wail, O gate; cry, O city; you have melted away, O Philistia, all of you, for smoke comes out 
of the north. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:%2030,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14: 30, 31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Killing the root with famine and slaying the remnant' stands for the removal of goods and truths which the Lord has stored away inwardly - 'the remnant' meaning such 
goods and truths, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>- <a href="562.htm">562</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="798.htm">798</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>. 'Gate' stands for the place of entry into things that are interior, that is, into the rational mind. 'City' stands for that

In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The city of hollowness will be broken down, every house will be shut up to prevent it being entered. There will be an outcry in the streets over [the lack] of wine, all joy

in the midst of the peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:%2010-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24: 10-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The city of hollowness' which 'will be broken down' stands for the human mind deprived of truth. 'Every house will be shut up' stands for lack of 
good - 'house' meaning good, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>. 'An outcry in the streets over [the lack of] wine' stands for a state of falsity - 'outcry' having reference to falsities, <a href="2240.htm">2240</a>. 'Wine' means truth over which there 
will be an outcry because there is none, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, and 'streets' means the things that lead to truths, <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>. 'The joy which is being made desolate' has reference to truth, 'the gladness of the earth 
that is being banished' to good. All this shows what is meant by 'what is left in the city will be desolation' and 'the gate will be smitten with vastation'. The gate is said to be vastated when nothing 
but evils and falsities reign. </p>

In the visions of God he was brought to the door of the inner gate which looked towards the north. There he saw the great abominations of the house of Israel. He was also 
brought to the door of the gate of the house of Jehovah which looked towards the north. There also [he saw] abominations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%208:%203,%206,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 8: 3, 6, 14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The door of the inner gate which looked towards 
the north' stands for the place where interior falsities exist. 'The door of the gate of the house of Jehovah towards the north' stands for the place where interior evils exist. The fact that the falsities 
and evils are interior, and that it is an interior sphere in which such spirits and genii reside, see <a href="2121.htm">2121</a>-<a href="2124.htm">2124</a>. </p>

 All these places show what is meant by 'the gate of enemies', namely hell, or those from hell who are constantly mounting an assault 
on goods and truths. They have their seat with a person, as has been stated, in his natural mind; but when the person is such that he allows goods and truths, and so angels, to enter in, the Lord drives 
away from that seat those who are from hell. And once they have been driven away, the gate to heaven, or heaven itself, is opened. This gate also is mentioned in various places in the Word, as in 
Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A song in the land of Judah, Ours is a strong city, salvation will establish walls and rampart.

 From all these places it is evident that 'the 
gate of heaven' is the place where angels are present with a person, that is, where good and truth are flowing in from the Lord. Thus there are, as has been stated, two gates, to which the Lord refers 
in Matthew as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the road is broad which leads away to destruction; and those who enter by it are many. For narrow and strait is the road 
that leads to life, and those who find it are few. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:%2012-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7: 12-14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:-23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:-23, 24</a>.

Quod `hereditabit semen tuum portam hostium {1}tuorum significet quod charitas et fides succedet loco ubi prius malum et falsum, constat ex significatione `hereditare' quod sit vitam Domini {2}accipere, 
de qua n. 2658, hic succedere quia cum charitas et fides loco ubi prius malum et falsum, tunc vita Domini succedit; ex significatione `seminis' quod sit charitas et fides, de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 
1941; a significatione `portae,' de qua sequitur; et a significatione `hostium' quod sint mala et falsa, seu quod idem, qui in malo et falso; hi significantur per hostes et inimicos in sensu interno 
Verbi.  [2] Quod significationem `portae' attinet, sunt in genere binae portae apud unumquemvis hominem; una patet ad infernum, quae aperta est malis et falsis inde, in illa porta sunt infernales 
genii et spiritus; altera porta patet versus caelum, quae aperta est bonis et veris inde, in illa porta sunt angeli; ita est porta quae ducit ad infernum, et porta quae ducit ad caelum:  porta inferni 
aperta est illis qui sunt in malo et falso, et tantum per rimas circumcirca superne aliquid lucis e caelo intrat, per quam possint cogitare et ratiocinari; porta autem caeli aperta est illis qui sunt 
in bono et vero inde:  [3] sunt enim binae viae quae ducunt in mentem hominis rationalem, via superior seu interna, per quam intrat bonum et verum a Domino, et via inferior seu externa, per quam malum 
et falsum subintrat ab inferno; ipsa mens rationalis est in medio ad quam tendunt viae; mens illa a bonis et veris quae ibi, in Verbo comparatur urbi et vocatur `urbs,' et quia comparatur urbi et vocatur 
urbs, designantur illi portae, et describitur passim quod hostes, hoc est, mali genii et spiritus illam urbem obsideant, et quod impugnent, et quod angeli a Domino, hoc est, Dominus illam defendat; 
infernales genii et spiritus cum malis et falsis, non ulterius venire possunt quam ad portam inferiorem seu externam, et nusquam in urbem, si potuissent in urbem seu in mentem rationalem, foret prorsus 
actum cum homine; at cum eo usque veniunt ut urbem illam expugnavisse sibi videantur, tunc clauditur illa sic ut non influat bonam et verum amplius in illam e caelo, solum, ut dictum, aliquid per 
rimas circumcirca; inde est quod tales non amplius aliquid charitatis nec aliquid fidei habeant, sed ponant in malo bonum et in falso verum, inde etiam est quod illi non amplius vere rationales sint, 
tametsi sibi videantur esse, n. 1914, 1944; et inde est quod dicantur `homines mortui,' tametsi se prae aliis {3}vivere credant, n. 81, 290 f.; {4}haec ex causa quia porta caeli illis clausa est; quod 
illis clausa, manifeste apparet et appercipitur in altera vita; tum quoque vicissim, quod porta caeli aperta sit illis qui in bono et vero.  [4] Quod `portam hostium,' de qua in hoc versu, in specie 
attinet, est illa apud hominem in mente ejus naturali; illam, cum prorsus naturalis est homo seu non regeneratus, occupant mala et falsa, seu quod idem, in illam influunt mali genii et spiritus cum 
cupiditatibus mali et persuasionibus falsi, videatur n. 687, 697, 1692; cum autem homo spiritualis sit seu regeneratur, tunc mala et falsa, seu quod idem, genii et spiritus mali ab illa porta, seu ab 
illa mente, expelluntur, quibus expulsis succedunt bona et vera, seu charitas et fides, {5}quae significantur per quod `hereditabit semen tuum portam hostium {6}suorum'; hoc fit in particulari apud unumquemvis 
hominem cum regeneratur, {7}similiter in altera vita illis qui in regnum Domini veniunt, et hoc quoque fit in communi, seu in Ecclesia, quae est plurium:  [5] repraesentatum hoc fuit per quod 
filii Israelis expulerint gentes a terra Canaane; hoc in sensu litterali intelligitur per quod `hereditabit semen tuum portam hostium,' at in sensu interno significantur illa quae dicta sunt:  inde 
antiquis temporibus sollemne factum ita dicere cum benedicerentur illi qui conjugium inirent, ut quoque patet a benedictione Labanis ad Rebeccam sororem, cum haec desponsata iret ad Jishakum,        
   Soror nostra, tu esto in millia myriadis, et hereditet semen tuum portam osorum {8}tuorum, Gen. xxiv 60. Quod talia per `portam hostium seu osorum' in Verbo significentur, constare potest a sequentibus 
locis; [6] apud Esaiam,           Interimam fame radicem tuam, et reliquias tuas occidam; ejula porta, clama urbs, liquefacta est Philistaea tota tu, quia e septentrione fumus venit, xiv 30, 31; </p>

<p>`ostium portae interioris spectans versus septentrionem' pro loco ubi interiora falsa; `ostium 
portae domus Jehovae versus septentrionem' ubi interiora mala; quod falsa et mala interiora sint, et quod sit interior sphaera in qua tales spiritus et genii, videatur n. 2121-2124:  [13] apud Davidem, 
           Ecce possessio Jehovae filii, merces fructus ventris,       sicut tela in manu validi, ita filii primitiarum, beatus vir      qui implevit pharetram suam ab illis; non pudefient, quia  
    loquentur cum hostibus in porta, Ps. cxxvii 3, 4 [5]; </p>
<p>`loqui cum hostibus in porta' pro nihil timere mala et falsa, ita nec infernum:  apud Esaiam,                                            
      In die illo erit Jehovah Zebaoth ... in spiritum      judicii sedenti ad judicium, in fortitudinem avertentibus      praelium ad portam, et etiam hi vino insaniunt, et sicera      errant, xxviii

ad armamentarium domus silvae, xxii 6-8: apud Jeremiam,           Luxit Jehudah, et portae ejus languefactae, {15}atruerunt ad terram, et clamor Hierosolymae ascendit,magnates miserunt minores ad aquas, 
venerunt ad foveas, nec invenerunt aquas, xiv 1-3: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Seniores a porta cessarunt, juvenes a modulatione sua, Thren. v 14; </p>
<p>[14] ex his constare potest quid significat `porta 
hostium' quod nempe infernum, seu infernales, qui continue impugnant bona et vera, eorum sedes est apud hominem, ut dictum, in mente ejus naturali; sed cum homo talis est ut admittat bona et vera, ita 
angelos, tunc a Domino abiguntur infernales a sede illa, quibus abactis aperitur porta caeli seu caelum; haec porta etiam in Verbo passim memoratur; ut apud Esaiam,           Canticum in terra Jehudae: 
 urbs valida nobis, salus       ponet muros et antemurale; aperite portas, et ingredietur gens       justa, custodiens fidelitates, xxvi 1, 2 apud eundem,           Sic dixit Jehovah uncto suo 
{16} Koresho, cujus       apprehendi dextram, ad descendere faciendum coram illo gentes,       et lumbos regum aperiam, ad aperiendum coram illo valvas, et       portae non occludentur:  Ego coram 
te ibo, et tortuosa       rectificabo, valvas aeris confringam, et vectes ferri       concidam, xlv 1, 2: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Aedificabunt filii alienigenae muros tuos, et reges       eorum 
ministrabunt tibi,...aperient portas tuas jugiter, diu      et noctu non occludentur:...non audietur amplius violentia in      terra tua, vastitas et confractio in terminis tuis, et vocabis      salutem 
muros tuos, et portas tuas laudem, lx 10, 11, 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Transite, transite portas, parate viam populo,      sternite, sternite semitam,...dicite filiae Zionis, Ecce salus   
   tua venit, lxii 10-12: </p>
<p>apud Micham,           Transibunt per portam, et exibunt per illam, et      transibit rex eorum coram illis, et Jehovah in principio      eorum, ii 13: </p>
<p>apud Davidem,   
        Attollite portae capita vestra, et extollimini ostia       aeterna, et intrabit Rex gloria.  Quis hic Rex gloriae?      Jehovah fortis et heros, Jehovah heros belli; attollite portae      capita 
vestra, attollite ostia aeterna, Ps. xxiv 7-10: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Celebra Hierosolyma Jehovam, lauda Deum tuum Zion, quia      firmat vectes portarum tuarum, benedicit filiis tuis in medio  
    tui, Ps. cxlvii 12, 13. [15] Ex his patet quod `porta caeli' sit ubi angeli apud hominem, hoc  est, ubi influxus boni et veri a Domino; ita quod binae portae sint, ut dictum:  de {17}binis 
portis ita Dominus apud Matthaeum,           Intrate per angustam portam, quia lata porta et      spatiosa via quae abducit ad interitum, et multi sunt qui      intrant per eam; quia angusta et stricta 
via quae ducit ad      vitam, et pauci sunt qui inveniunt eam, vii 12-14; Luc. xiii      23, 24. Praeterea de portis ad Novam Hierosolymam, et de portis ad novum Templum, multis agitur apud 
Ezechielem, etiam apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, per quas nec aliud intelligitur quam aditus ad caelum; </p>
<p>de quibus videatur, Ezech. xl 6-49; xliii 1, 2, 4; xliv 1-3; xlvi 1-9, 12; xlviii 31-34; Apoc. 
xxi 12, 13, 21, 25; xxii 14; Esai. liv 11, 12; inde Hierosolyma appellatur `porta populi,' Mich. i 9; </p>
