<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2474节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2474.</strong>人所耳闻目睹、并为之感动的所有事，尽管不为这人所知，全都被植入在他的内部记忆中。它们在那里保留下来，丝毫没有丢失，即便这些事在外部记忆中被抹去。因此，内部记忆具有这样的特点，它将这个人所曾想过、说过，或做过的一切细节，甚至每一个最细微之处都刻写在它里面，包括那些在他看来显得很模糊的事，甚至是细节。这些都是人从很小直到很老所发生的事。进入来世后，人会保留对所有这些事的记忆，并逐渐被带回到对它们的全部回忆中。这就是人在来世被打开，并照之受审判的生命册。到那时，人对此几乎难以置信，但这却是千真万确的。在他看来曾处于模糊状态的所有目的，他的所有想法，以及随之而来的所有言行，直到最细微之处，都写在那生命册中，即内部记忆中。主若允许，它们会如同在大白天那样显现在天使面前。这一点已数次向我显明，并通过大量经历向我证明，丝毫没有怀疑的余地。</p>

All things whatever that a man hears and sees, and by which he is affected, are, unknown to the man, insinuated as to ideas and ends into his interior memory; and they remain in it, so that not anything 
perishes; although the same things are obliterated in the exterior memory. Such therefore is the interior memory that there are inscribed on it all the single, nay, the most singular things that the 
man has ever thought, spoken, and done; nay, even those which have appeared to him as but a shade, with the minutest particulars, from his earliest infancy to the last of old age. The memory of all 
these things the man has with him when he comes into the other life, and he is successively brought into full recollection of them. This is his Book of Life, which is opened in the other life, and according 
to which he is judged. He then can scarcely believe this, but yet it is most true. All the ends, which to him have been in obscurity, and all the things he has thought; together with everything 
that from these he has spoken and done, down to the smallest point, are in that Book, that is, in the interior memory, and whenever the Lord grants, are made manifest before the angels as in clear day. 
This has several times been shown me, and has been attested by so much experience that not the least doubt remains. </p>

Without his knowing it, the ideas and the ends in view belonging to all the things which a person sees and hears, and for which he feels an affection, are implanted in his interior memory, and there 
they remain without anything being lost, even if they are erased from his exterior memory. The interior memory is such therefore that it has written into it every detail, indeed every smallest detail, 
which the person has ever thought, said, or done, including those things which appeared to him in shadow, even the tiniest. This goes on from earliest childhood right through to extreme old age. The 
memory of all those things man retains on entering the next life, and he is gradually brought into a complete recollection of them. This is HIS BOOK OF LIFE which is opened in the next life and according 
to which he is judged. This is something man may scarcely credit but it is nevertheless perfectly true. All his ends in view, which for him had lain in obscurity, and all his thoughts, also all his 
consequent utterances and deeds, down to the smallest point of all, are written down in that Book, that is, in his interior memory. And as often as the Lord permits, they are brought out into the open 
before angels as if in broad daylight. This has been demonstrated to me frequently and proved to me from so many experiences as to leave no room for any shadow of doubt. </p>

Quaecumque homo audit et videt, et quibus afficitur, haec quoad ideas et fines insinuantur, homine nesciente, in memoriam ejus interiorem, et in illa remanent, sic ut non pereat quicquam; tametsi eadem 
obliterantur i memoria {1} exteriore.  Talis itaque est memoria interior ut ei inscripta sint singula, immo singularissima, quae usquam homo cogitavit, locutus est, egit, immo quae ei sicut umbra apparuerunt, 
cum minutissimis, a prima infantia ad ultimum senectae. Omnium horum memoriam secum habet homo cum venit in alteram vitam, et in omnem illorum recordationem successive perducitur; hic est 
LIBER EJUS VITAE qui aperitur in altera vita, secundum quem judicatur; hoc vix homo credere potest, sed usque est verissimum; omnes fines qui ei in obscuro fuerunt, et omnia cogitata, tum omnia locuta 
et facta inde, ad omnium minimum apicem, in Libro illo, hoc est, in memoria interiore sunt, et patent, quoties Dominus {2} concedit, coram angelis sicut in clara die: hoc mihi aliquoties ostensum est, 
et tam multis experientiis testatum ut ne minimum dubii relictum sit. 	@1 i ejus.$ 	@2 i id.$ </p>
