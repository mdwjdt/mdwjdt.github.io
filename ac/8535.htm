<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8535节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8535.</strong>“亚伦就怎么把吗哪存放在法柜前，保留起来”表它在神性面前。这从“存放，保留起来”和“在法柜前”的含义清楚可知：“存放，保留起来”是指保留对它的记忆（参看<a href="8526.htm">8526</a>e，<a href="8533.htm">8533</a>节）；“在法柜前”是指在神性面前。“法柜或法版”表示神性，这一点从前文明显看出来，在那里，摩西对亚伦说，要“存在耶和华面前”（参看<a href="8532.htm">8532</a>节），也就是存在神性面前。“法柜或法版”之所以表示神性，是因为就普遍意义而言，“法柜或法版”表示圣言，圣言是神性真理，因而是主。主就是圣言，这一点明显可见于约翰福音：<br />起初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神；圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“法柜或法版”是指神性真理方面的主，这一点从盛有西乃山所宣布的律法的约柜明显看出来，这约柜就被称为“法柜”。帐幕由此拥有它的一切圣洁；法柜是神的神圣本身，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：它上面有施恩座和基路伯；就在幔子的外面有金桌子、陈设饼和灯台；亚伦在那里执行最神圣的敬拜行为；耶和华后来在那里从施恩座上两基路伯之间，因而从法柜和摩西说话（对此，参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.16.htm">25:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.20.htm">40:20</a>）。</p>

And Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept. That this signifies that it was in the presence of the Divine, is evident from the signification of "laying up to be kept," as being for a memorial 
(see above n. 8526, 8533) and from the signification of "before the Testimony," as being in the presence of the Divine. That "the Testimony" denotes the Divine is plain from what goes before, where 
it is said by Moses to Aaron that "he should store it up before Jehovah" (see n. 8532), thus before the Divine. That "the Testimony" denotes the Divine is because in the universal sense by "the Testimony" 
is meant the Word, and because the Word is truth Divine, thus the Lord. That the Lord is "the Word," is plain in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was 
the Word: and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us (1:1, 14). That "the Testimony" denotes the Lord as to Divine truth is evident from the ark wherein was the Law published from Sinai, which is 
called "the Testimony:" that from this the tabernacle had all its sanctity, and that the Testimony was the holy Divine itself, is evident from the fact that above it was the propitiatory with the cherubs, 
and next outside the veil were the tables of gold with the loaves, and with the lamps; and that the most holy thing of worship was there administered by Aaron; also that Jehovah afterward spake with 
Moses there above the propitiatory between the two cherubs, thus from the Testimony (on which see Exod. 25:16, 21, 22; 40:20). </p>

'So Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept' means that it was in the presence of the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'laying up to be kept' as to preserve the memory of it, as above 
in <a href="8526.htm">8526</a> (end), <a href="8533.htm">8533</a>; and from the meaning of 'before the Testimony' as in the presence of the Divine. The fact that 'the Testimony' means the Divine is evident from what comes before, where Moses 
tells Aaron to lay it up before Jehovah, <a href="8532.htm">8532</a>, that is, before the Divine. The reason why 'the Testimony' means the Divine is that in the universal sense 'the Testimony' is used to mean the Word, and 
the Word is Divine truth, thus the Lord. That He is the Word is evident in John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt 
among us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1, 14</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that 'the Testimony' is the Lord in respect of Divine Truth is clear from the ark containing the law delivered from Sinai, which is called the Testimony From it the 
tabernacle derived all the holiness it possessed, and the Testimony was God's holiness itself. This is evident from the consideration that above it there was the Mercy Seat with the cherubim; immediately 
outside the veil there, there stood the tables of gold with the loaves and the lamps; Aaron performed the holiest act of worship there and also Jehovah afterwards spoke to Moses there, above the Mercy 
Seat between the two cherubs, thus from the Testimony. For these details, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2022:16,%2021,%2022;%2040:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 22:16, 21, 22; 40:20</a>. </p>

`Et reposuit illud Aharon coram Testimonio ad custodiam': quod significet quod in praesentia Divini, constat ex significatione `reponere ad custodiam' quod sit {1}in memoriale, ut supra n. 8526 fin., 
8533, et ex significatione `coram Testimonio' quod sit in praesentia Divini; quod Testimonium sit Divinum, patet a praecedentibus, {2}ubi dicitur a Moscheh ad Aharonem quod reponeret illud coram Jehovah, 
n. 8532, ita coram Divino; quod `Testimonium' sit Divinum, est quia per Testimonium intelligitur in universali sensu Verbum, et quia Verbum est verum Divinum {3}, ita {4} Dominus; Qui quod sit Verbum, 
patet apud Johannem, In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum: et Verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis, i 1, 14; </p>
<p>quod `Testimonium' sit Dominus quoad Divinum 
Verum, constat ex arca in qua lex e Sinai lata, quae Testimonium vocatur; quod ex eo fuerit omnis sanctitas Tabernaculo, et quod Testimonium fuerit ipsum sanctum Divinum, patet ex eo quod supra 
illud esset propitiatorium cum cherubis, proxime extra velum ibi essent mensae aureae cum panibus, et cum lucernis, et quod sanctissimum cultus ibi ab Aharone ministraretur, tum quod Jehovah postea cum 
Moscheh loqueretur ibi supra propitiatorium inter duos cherubos, ita ex Testimonio, de quibus videatur Exod. xxv 16, 21, 22, xl 20. 	@1 ad$ 	@2 quod Moscheh dixerit$ 	@3 i quod procedit a Domino$ 	@4 i est$ </p>
