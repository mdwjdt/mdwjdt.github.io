<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8369节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8369.</strong>“七十棵棕树”表同等量的真理之良善，也就是一切丰盛的真理之良善。这从“七十”和“棕树”的含义清楚可知：“七十”和“十二”一样，也表示整体上的一切事物（参看<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）；“棕树”是指属灵教会的良善，也就是真理之良善。“棕树”因表示良善，故也表示对良善的情感和由这种情感所产生的快乐，因为一切快乐皆来自对良善的情感。“棕树”因具有这种含义，故也用于神圣的节日，如根据摩西五经中的以下经文，在住棚节：<br />第一日，要拿美好树上的果子和棕树叶，与茂密树的枝条，并溪流边的杨柳枝，在耶和华你们的神面前欢乐七日。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.40.htm">23:40</a>）<br />“美好树上的果子”表示属天良善，“棕树”表示属灵良善或真理之良善；“茂密树的枝条”表示记忆知识的真理；“溪流边的杨柳枝”表示属于属世层的最低级的真理；因此，这四者表示在其适当秩序中的一切良善和真理。<br />“棕树”是源于良善的神圣节日的标志，这一点从以下经文也能清楚<br />看出来：<br />有一大群上来过节的人听见耶稣将到耶路撒冷，就拿着棕树枝，出去迎接祂，喊着：和散那！奉主名来的以色列王是应当称颂的！（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.12.htm">12:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.13.htm">13</a>）<br />启示录：<br />我观看，见有一大群人，站在宝座和羔羊面前，披着白袍，手拿棕树枝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.9.htm">7:9</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />葡萄树枯干，无花果树衰残，石榴树、棕树也都枯乾；一切喜乐都从人的众子那里枯干。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.12.htm">1:12</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />义人要发旺如棕树，生长如黎巴嫩的香柏树。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗92.12.htm">92:12</a>）<br />此处“棕树”表示良善，“香柏树”表示真理。<br />“棕树”因表示良善，故也表示智慧，因为智慧属于良善。殿的墙上刻着的棕树与基路伯并花表示这种智慧；因为“殿”表示主自己，在代表意义上表示天堂（<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。“香柏树”、“棕树”和“墙上的花”表示来自主的旨意，智慧和聪明，因而表示属于天堂的一切事物。它们 被刻在殿的墙上，这一事实明显可见于列王纪：<br />所罗门在内殿周围的墙上，都刻着基路伯、棕树和初开之花的雕像。在橄榄木做的两门扇上，刻着基路伯、棕树和初开之花的雕像，都包上金子，他在基路伯和棕树上也洒上金子。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.29.htm">6:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.32.htm">32</a>）<br />这些“雕像”代表天堂的状态；“基路伯”代表主的圣治或天命，因而代表一切事物皆来自祂这一真理，“基路伯”表示圣治或天命（参看<a href="308.htm">308</a>节）；“棕树”代表属于来自主的良善的智慧；“花”代表属于来自主的真理的聪明；包基路伯和棕树的“金子”表示在众天堂普遍占据主导地位的爱之良善。“金”表示爱之良善（参看<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）。这一切也解释了为何以西结书中对表示主之天堂的新殿的描述中，经上说“基路伯”和“棕树”在四处的墙上（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.17.htm">41:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.26.htm">26</a>）。</p>

And seventy palm-trees. That this signifies the goods of truth in like manner, that is, in all abundance, is evident from the signification of "seventy," as being all things in the complex, in like manner 
as "twelve" (see n. 7973); and from the signification of "palm-trees," as being the goods of the spiritual church, which are the goods of truth; and because by "palm-trees" are signified goods, 
by them is also signified the affection of good, and the consequent delight, for all delight is from the affection of good. As this was signified by "palm-trees," therefore also palm-trees were employed 
in holy festivities, as in the feast of tabernacles, according to these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye shall take for you in the first day the fruit of a tree of honor, spathes of palm-trees, and a branch 
of a dense tree, and willows of the torrent; and ye shall be glad before Jehovah your God seven days (Lev. 23:40); </p>
<p>by "the fruit of a tree of honor," is signified celestial good; by "palm-trees," spiritual 
good, or the good of truth; by "a branch of a dense tree," the truth of memory-knowledge; and by "willows of the torrent," the lowest truths of the natural; thus by these four are signified all 
goods and truths in their order. [2] That "palm-trees" signified a holy festivity which is from good, is evident also from these words in the following passages: </p>
<p>     A great crowd that had come 
to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem, took boughs of palm trees, and went forth to meet Him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, even 
the King of Israel (John 12:12, 13).      I saw, when behold a great crowd standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands (Rev. 7:9).      The vine 
hath dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth, the pomegranate, and also the palm-tree, all joy hath dried up from the sons of man (Joel 1:12).      The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; 
he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon (Ps. 92:12); </p>
<p>here "palm-tree" denotes good; and "cedar" truth. [3] As a "palm-tree" signifies good, it also signifies wisdom, for wisdom is of good. This was signified 
by the palm-trees which together with the cherubs and flowers were carved upon the walls of the temple; for "the temple" signified the Lord Himself, and in the representative sense, heaven (n. 
2777, 3720). The "cherubs," the "palm-trees," and the "flowers upon the walls" signified Providence, wisdom, and intelligence, which are from the Lord, thus all things which are of heaven. That these 
were carved on the walls of the temple, is evident in the first book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Solomon carved all the walls of the house round about with openings of carvings of cherubs and palm-trees, and openings 
of flowers; and upon the two doors of woods of oil he carved carvings of cherubs and of palm-trees, and of openings of flowers, and overlaid them with gold, so that he overspread the gold upon 
the cherubs, and upon the palm-trees (6:29, 32);  by these carvings was represented the state of heaven; by the "cherubs," the Providence of the Lord, thus that from Him are all things (that cherubs 
denote Providence, see n. 308); by "palm-trees," wisdom, which is of good from the Lord; and by "flowers," intelligence, which is of truth from Him; by the "gold" with which the cherubs and palm-trees 
were overlaid, was signified the good of love which reigns universally in the heavens. (That "gold" denotes the good of love, see n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658.) Therefore also where the new temple is treated 
of in Ezekiel, by which is signified the heaven of the Lord, it is said that cherubs and palm-trees were upon the walls everywhere (41:17, 18, 20, 25, 26). </p>

'And seventy palm trees' means forms of the good of truth in like measure, that is to say, in full abundance. This is clear from the meaning of 'seventy' - like 'twelve' - as all things in their entirety, 
dealt with in <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>; and from the meaning of 'palm trees' as forms of good in the spiritual Church, which are forms of the good of truth. And since forms of good are meant by 'palm trees', an affection 
for good and the delight resulting from it are meant, for an affection for good is the source of all delight. Since 'palm trees' had this meaning they were also used in sacred festivities, such 
as the feast of tabernacles, in accordance with the following in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall take on the first day the fruit of a fine tree,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> fronds of palm trees, the bough of a thick tree, and willows of the 
powerful stream; and you shall be glad before Jehovah your God seven days. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The fruit of a fine tree' means celestial good, 'palm trees' spiritual good or the good of truth, 'the bough 
of a thick tree' truth in the form of factual knowledge, and 'willows of the powerful stream' lowest truths belonging to the natural. The four accordingly mean all forms of good and truths in their 
proper order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'palm trees' were signs of sacred festivity springing from good is also clear from the following in John, </p>
<blockquote>
A great crowd who had come to the feast, when they 
heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees, and went to meet Him, and cried, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
in the same author, in Revelation, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, and behold a large crowd standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches in their hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The vine has withered and the fig tree languishes, the pomegranate tree and also the palm; all joy has withered away from the sons of man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%201:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 1:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
The righteous will flourish 
like a palm tree; he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2092:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 92:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a palm tree' stands for good and 'a cedar' for truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since 'a palm tree' means good it also means wisdom, for wisdom 
is the discernment of good. The palm trees which were carved along with the cherubs and flowers on the walls of the temple were signs meaning such wisdom. 'The temple' meant the Lord Himself, and 
in the representative sense it meant heaven, <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>; 'the cherubs, palm trees, and flowers' on the walls meant providence, wisdom, and intelligence that are the Lord's, and so meant all things belonging 
to heaven. The fact that they were carved on the walls of the temple is clear in the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Solomon carved all the walls of the house all around with openings of carvings of 
cherubs,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and of palm trees, and with openings of flowers. And on the two doors of olive wood he carved carvings of cherubs and of palm trees, and openings of flowers, and overlaid them with gold, so 
that he spread gold over the cherubs and over the palm trees. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 6:29, <a href="32.htm">32</a>. </p>
<p>These 'carvings' represented the heavenly state; 'the cherubs' represented the Lord's Providence, thus the truth that 
all things come from Him (for the meaning of 'cherubs' as providence, see <a href="308.htm">308</a>); 'the palm trees' represented wisdom that is a discernment of good coming from the Lord; and 'the flowers' represented 
intelligence that is an understanding of truth coming from Him. 'Gold' with which the cherubs and palm trees were overlaid meant the good of love, which holds sway throughout heaven (for the meaning of 
'gold' as the good of love, see <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>). All this also explains why in the description in Ezekiel of the new temple, meaning the Lord's heaven, it says that 'cherubs and palm trees' were 
on the walls everywhere, Ezek. 41:17, <a href="18.htm">18</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>.

`Et septuaginta palmae': quod significet veri bona similiter, nempe in omni copia, constat ex significatione `septuaginta' quod sint omnia in complexu, similiter ac duodecim, de qua n. 7973; et ex significatione 
`palmarum' quod sint bona spiritualis Ecclesiae, quae sunt bona veri; et quia per `palmas' bona significantur, etiam per illas significatur affectio boni et inde jucundum, nam ex affectione 
boni est omne jucundum; quia (c)id per `palmas' {1}significabatur, ideo etiam palmae adhibebantur in {2}festivitatibus sanctis, ut in festo tabernaculorum, secundum haec apud Moschen, Accipietis 
vobis in die primo fructum arboris honoris, spathas palmarum, et ramum arboris densae, et salices torrentis; et laetemini coram Jehovah Deo vestro septem diebus, Lev. xxiii 40; </p>
<p>per `fructum arboris honoris' 
significatur bonum caeleste; per `palmas' bonum spirituale seu bonum veri; per `ramum arboris densae' verum scientificum; et per `salices torrentis' vera infima {3}naturalis; ita per quattuor 
illa significantur omnia bona et vera in suo ordine. 	2 Quod `palmae' {4}festivitatem sanctam quae ex bono significaverint, constat quoque ex his apud Johannem, Multa turba quae venerat ad festum, cum 
audirent quod veniret Jesus in Hierosolymam, sumpserunt termites palmarum, et iverunt obviam Ipsi, et clamaverunt, Osanna, benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini, Rex Israelis, xii 12, 13: </p>
<p>et apud 
eundem in Apocalypsi, Vidi, cum ecce turba multa, stantes coram throno et coram Agno, induti stolas albas, et palmae in manibus illorum, vii 9: </p>
<p>{5} apud Joelem, Vitis exaruit et ficus languet, malus 
punica, etiamque palma, exaruit omne gaudium de filiis hominis, {6} i 12: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, Justus sicut palma florebit, sicut cedrus in Libano crescet, Ps. xcii 13 [A.V. 12]; </p>
<p>hic `palma' pro bono et 
`cedrus' pro vero. 	3 Quia `palma' significat bonum, etiam significat sapientiam, nam sapientia est boni; illam significabant palmae quae una cum cherubis et floribus sculptae {7}fuerunt super parietibus 
templi; `templum' enim significabat Ipsum Dominum, et in sensu repraesentativo caelum, n. 2777, 3720, `cherubi, palmae, et flores' super parietibus significabant providentiam, sapientiam, et intelligentiam, 
quae a Domino, ita {8}omnia quae caeli sunt; quod illa parietibus templi insculpta sint, constat in Libro 1 Regum, Salomo omnes parietes domus in circuitu sculpsit aperturis sculpturarum 
cheruborum et palmarum, et aperturis florum; et super binas fores ex lignis olei, sculpsit sculpturas cheruborum et palmarum et aperturas florum; et obduxit auro, ita ut diduceret super cherubos et super 
palmas aurum, vi 29, 32; </p>
<p>per `sculpturas' illas repraesentatus est status caeli, per `cherubos' Providentia Domini, ita quod ab Ipso omnia; quod `cherubi' sint providentia {9}, videatur n. 308, 
per `palmas' sapientia quae est boni a Domino, et per `flores' intelligentia quae est veri ab Ipso; per `aurum' quo obducebantur cherubi et palmae, significabatur bonum amoris, quod in caelis est {10}universaliter 
regnans; {11}quod aurum sit bonum amoris, videatur n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658; {12}ideo quoque, ubi de novo templo, per quod significatur caelum Domini, agitur apud Ezechielem, {13} dicitur
