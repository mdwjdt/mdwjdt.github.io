<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6959节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6959.</strong>“耶和华又对他说”表预见那些属于属灵教会的人若没有信，将是何性质。这从“耶和华说”的含义清楚可知，“耶和华说”是指预见，如前所述（<a href="6946.htm">6946</a>节）。这句话表示对未来的预见，即那些属于属灵教会的人若没有信，将是何性质的原因在于下文。下文论述的主题是“以色列人”所代表的属灵教会成员若没有信，将是何性质，即：他们将变成真理的亵渎者。因为第一个神迹，即杖变成蛇，表示他们的状态，即他们将完全变得感官和肉体化的一个状态。手长大麻疯这个神迹表示亵渎，因为如果该教会仍旧没有信，接下来就是这个样子。<br />在孩童时期，以及之后的青少年时期，那些属于属灵教会的人拥有对其教会教义事物的信。但那时他们所拥有的信是从父母和老师那里获得的，不是凭自己的努力。因此，他们以后若放弃信仰，只会稍微亵渎真理；这种亵渎能通过神性手段被除去，这人由此摆脱它所造成的罪责。不过，如果一个人凭自己的努力拥有对教会教义的信，也就是为自己确认他所接受的教导，但后来又放弃，不肯接受他以前所信的，尤其所过的生活违背他曾为自己所确认的真理，要么随从己意解释它，要么完全弃绝它，他就会亵渎真理。这是因为他在自己里面将真理与虚假混和并联结在一起。这种人因几乎没有任何真理与良善的余留，故在来世最终变得像骷髅，所剩下的生命，和相对于血肉的有机生命的骨头所拥有的一样少。然而，那些亵渎良善之人的命运比那些亵渎真理之人的还要可怕。那些属于属灵教会的人能亵渎真理，不那么能亵渎良善。<br />由于“麻疯”表示对真理的亵渎，并且这是下文论述的主题，故先请看前面关于亵渎的阐述和说明，即：教会之内的人能亵渎神圣事物，教会之外的人不能（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）；只有那些以前曾承认神圣事物的人才能亵渎它们（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>节）；那些不知道神圣事物的人，以及那些不承认它们的人无法亵渎它们（<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>节）；承认并相信真理与良善，然而却过着一种违背它们的生活，也是亵渎（<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>节）；人尽可能地被阻止亵渎（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>-<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>节）；在来世，亵渎者的命运是最糟糕的（<a href="6348.htm">6348</a>节）。</p>

And Jehovah said further to him. That this signifies foresight as to what would be the quality of those of the spiritual church if they did not have faith, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah 
said," as being foresight (as above, n. 6946). The reason why these words denote what would be the quality of those of the spiritual church if they did not have faith, is that in what follows the subject 
treated of is what would be the further quality of those who are of the spiritual church (who are represented by the sons of Israel), if they did not have faith, namely, that they would be profaners 
of truth. For the first miracle of the rod becoming a serpent signifies their state, that they would become altogether sensuous and corporeal. This miracle of the hand becoming leprous signifies 
profanation, for this succeeds if the church persists in faithlessness. [2] In their childhood, and afterward in their youth, they of the spiritual church have faith in the doctrinal things of their 
church, but at that time they have faith from parents and masters, and not from themselves, and therefore if they afterward recede from faith, they profane the truth only slightly, which profanation 
can be removed by Divine means, and thus the man be freed from the guilt of it. But if a man has faith in the doctrine of the church, and in the Word, from himself, that is, by confirmations in himself, 
and if he then afterward recedes, and denies in himself what he had before believed, especially if he lives contrary to the truth which he had confirmed in himself, and either explains it in his own 
favor, or altogether rejects it, he profanes the truth; and this because he commingles and conjoins together within himself truth and falsity. As such persons have scarcely any remains of truth and 
good, in the other life they finally become like skeletons; and have as little life remaining as have the bones relatively to the organic life of the flesh. But still harder is the lot of those who profane 
good than that of those who profane truth, they who are of the Lord's spiritual church can profane truth but not so much good.  [3] As "leprosy" signifies the profanation of truth, and as this 
is the subject treated of in what follows, see first of all what has been before said and shown about profanation, namely: That they who are within the church can profane holy things, but not they who 
are without it (n. 2051, 3399): That holy things cannot be profaned, except by those who have previously acknowledged them (n. 1008, 1010, 1059, 3398, 3898, 4289): That it is also profanation to acknowledge 
and believe truths and goods, and yet to live contrary to them (n. 4601): That man is withheld from profanation as much as possible (n. 301-303, 1327-1328, 3398, 3402); that the lot of profaners 
is the worst of all in the other life (n. 6348). </p>

'And Jehovah said further to him' means foresight of what those who belonged to the spiritual Church were going to be like if they were not in possession of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah 
said' as foresight, as above in <a href="6946.htm">6946</a>. The reason it means that this future was foreseen - what those who belonged to the spiritual Church would be like if they were not in possession of faith 
- lies in the words that immediately follow. These deal with members of the spiritual Church, represented by 'the children of Israel', describing what they were going to be like if they did not possess 
faith, that they would become profaners of truth. For the first miracle in which the rod became a serpent means their state, a state in which they would become wholly sensory- and bodily-minded; the 
present miracle in which Moses' hand became leprous means profanation since this would come next if that Church continued to be devoid of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In childhood, and after that in adolescence, those 
who belong to the spiritual Church possess faith in the things taught by their Church. But during those years the faith they possess is obtained from parents and teachers, not by their own efforts. 
If therefore they subsequently give up that faith they can profane truth only to a small extent, and Divine means can be used to remove that profanation, thereby freeing a person from guilt on account 
of it. But if a person possesses faith in what the Church teaches and in the Word as a result of his own efforts, that is, he confirms for himself what he has been taught, but after that gives it up 
and refuses to accept what he has previously believed - and especially if he leads a life that goes against the truth he has confirmed for himself, and either explains it to suit himself or totally 
rejects it - he renders truth profane. The reason why is that within himself he mixes up and joins together truth and falsity. Because people like this have scarcely any remnants of what is true and good 
they come at length in the next life to be like skeletons, having as little life left as one's bones possess in comparison with the organic life of the flesh. A more direful lot however awaits those 
who render good profane than those who render truth profane. Those belonging to the spiritual Church are able to profane truth, but they are less able to do the same thing to good.  </p>

 Since 'leprosy' 
means the profanation of truth and is referred to in what follows next, please see first what has been stated and shown already about profanation:  </p>
<p>Those within the Church are capable of profaning 
holy things, but not those outside it, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>. </p>
<p>Holy things cannot be profaned except by those who first acknowledge them, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>. </p>
<p>People who do not know holy things, and also those who 
do not acknowledge them, cannot profane them, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>. </p>
<p>It is also profanation when one acknowledges and believes truths and forms of good and yet leads a life that goes against 
them, <a href="4601.htm">4601</a>. </p>
<p>A person is withheld as far as is possible from profanation, <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3402.htm">3402</a>. </p>

`Et dixit Jehovah illi adhuc': quod significet praevidentiam quales futuri qui ab Ecclesia spirituali si non fidem haberent, constat ex significatione `dixit Jehovah' quod sit praevidentia, ut supra 
n. 6946; {1}quod sit quales futuri qui ab Ecclesia spirituali si non fidem haberent, est quia agitur in nunc sequentibus de illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali {2}, qui repraesentantur per `filios Israelis,' 
quales ulterius futuri si non fidem haberent, quod nempe fierent profanatores veri; nam primum miraculum quod `baculus serpens factus' significat statum eorum, quod prorsus sensuales et corporei 
fierent; hoc miraculum quod `manus facta leprosa' significat profanationem, {3}nam haec succedit, si Ecclesia illa perstat in infidelitate. 	2 Illi {4} qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, {5} in pueritia sua, 
(c)et dein in adolescentia, fidem habent doctrinalibus suae Ecclesiae, sed tunc fidem habent ex parentibus et magistris, non autem ex se, quapropter si postea recedunt a fide, non profanant verum nisi 
{6} leviter, quae profanatio per media Divina removeri potest, et sic homo a reatu inde liberari; at si homo fidem habet doctrinae Ecclesiae (c)et Verbo ex se, hoc est, per {7}confirmationes apud 
se, si tunc {8}postea recedit, et apud se negat quod prius crediderat, imprimis si {9}vivit contra verum quod apud se confirmaverat, et id vel explicat in sui favorem {10}, vel prorsus rejicit, is profanat 
verum; ex causa quia verum et falsum intus in se commiscet et conjungit; tales quia reliquias veri et boni vix aliquas habent, fiunt tandem in altera vita sicut sceleta, et tam paucam vitam residuam 
habent, qualis est ossium respective ad vitam organicam carnis; attamen durior sors est illorum qui profanant bonum quam eorum qui profanant verum; qui ab Ecclesia spirituali Domini sunt profanare 
verum possunt, non autem ita bonum. 	3 Quia lepra {11} profanationem veri significat, et de illa in nunc sequentibus agitur, videantur primum quae de profanatione prius dicta et ostensa sunt; nempe 
quod qui intra Ecclesiam sunt profanare possint sancta, non autem qui extra, n. 2051, 3399 quod sancta profanari nequeant nisi ab illis qui prius agnoverunt n. 3398: quod profanare sancta nequeant qui 
non sciunt illa, ut et qui non agnoverunt n. 1008, 1010, 1059, (x)3398, 3898, 4289: quod profanatio `etiam sit agnoscere et credere vera et bona, et tamen vivere contra illa, n. 4601: quod teneatur 
homo a profanatione quantum possibile, n. 301-303, 1327, 1328, 3398, 3402 quod sors profanatorum omnium pessima sit in altera vita, n. 6348. 	@1 quae agitur hic$ 	@2 i sunt$ 	@3 veri; si interius perstarent$ 	@4
