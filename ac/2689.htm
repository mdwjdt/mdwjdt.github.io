<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2689节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2689．“放声大哭”表愈加悲伤。这从“放声大哭”的含义清楚可知，“放声大哭”是指极度悲伤，因为大声哭泣并非指别的。本节描述了那些正变得属灵之人所体验的真理荒凉的状态和除去真理的状态。下面简要解释一下当如何理解这些事：无法被改造的人根本就不知道什么是丧失真理的悲伤，他们以为没人会因这种事而有丝毫焦虑。他们认为，唯一的焦虑可能是因为丧失了肉体和世俗的好处，如健康、地位、名声、财富和生命。但那些能被改造的人完全不这么想。主将这些人保守在对良善的情感和对真理的思维中，因此，当丧失这种思维和情感时，他们会感到焦虑。<br />众所周知，所有焦虑和悲伤都是由于人丧失了他已产生感情，也就是所爱的东西，人若只对肉体和世俗之物有感情，也就是说，只爱这些东西，那么当丧失它们时，就会感到悲伤。而人若对属灵的良善与真理有情感，热爱这些事物，那么当丧失它们时，同样会感到悲伤。人的生命无非是情感或爱。由此可见，就其已产生感情或所爱的良善与真理而言，那些荒凉之人的状态是何性质；也就是说，其悲伤的状态因更内在而更严重；在丧失良善与真理的过程中，他们不在乎肉体的死亡，因为他们对此并不关心，只关心永远的死亡。此处描述的，正是他们的状态。<br />这一点必须简要加以解释，好叫人们知道哪些人被主保守在对良善与真理的情感中，因而能被改造，变得属灵，哪些人则不能。童年时期，每个人在第一次充满良善与真理时，都会被主保守在这样的肯定态度中：即凡父母和老师所说所教的，都是对的。对那些能变得属灵之人而言，这种肯定态度会通过知识和认知得以强化。因为凡他们所学到的相关东西都会将自身引入这种肯定观点中，强化它，并越来越引向对它的情感。他们就是那些照着自己所信的真理本质变得属灵，并在试探中得胜的人。但那些不能变得属灵之人则截然不同。尽管他们也具有童年时的肯定态度，但长大后，他们就允许怀疑进驻，从而摧毁了对良善与真理的肯定态度。成年后，他们又允许否认进驻，甚至允许对虚假的情感进驻。若这种人被引入试探，他们必要完全屈服。因此，他们被免于试探。<br />但他们允许怀疑，后来又允许否认进驻的真正原因可追溯到他们邪恶的生活。人若过着邪恶的生活，就绝不可能干别的。因为如前所述，人的生命就是他的情感或爱，情感或爱如何，思维就如何。对邪恶的情感和对真理的思维绝不会结合在一起。对那些看似有这种结合的人来说，这种结合并非真的存在，他们只有对真理的思维，没有对真理的情感。因此，对这种人而言，真理并非真理，只不过是一种声音，或挂在嘴上的东西，而心却不在其中。即便很坏的人也能知道这类真理，有时比别人更清楚。有些人还被这类真理强有力地说服，以致没人知道它不是纯正的真理。然而，若没有良善的生活，它并非纯正的真理。正是我欲或物欲的情感造成了这种说服，以致他们满腔热情地扞卫它，甚至发展到诅咒那些不接受它，或不以同样的方式相信它之人的程度。不过，这类真理因人而异，取决于人的基本思维方式，并随着我欲或物欲的强化而强化。诚然，它天生就粘附着邪恶，但并未与邪恶结合，故在世来会被根除。那些过着良善生活的人则迥然不同。在这些人里面，真理本身会找到自己的土壤，其能力也会逐渐增强，并且它会从主那里拥有自己的生命。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2689</b></p><p><b>2689.</b>
And she lifted up her voice and wept. That this signifies a further degree of grief, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the voice and weeping," as being the last degree of grief; for weeping 
with a loud voice is nothing else. The state of desolation of truth, and also of removal from truths, with those who are becoming spiritual, is described in this verse. How these things are to be 
understood shall be briefly told. Those who cannot be reformed do not at all know what it is to grieve on account of being deprived of truths; for they suppose that no one can feel in the least anxious 
about such a thing. The only anxiety they believe to be possible is on account of being deprived of the goods of the body and the world; such as health, honors, reputation, wealth, and life. But they 
who can be reformed believe altogether differently: these are kept by the Lord in the affection of good and in the thought of truth; and therefore they come into anxiety when deprived of this thought 
and affection. [2] It is known that all anxiety and grief arise from being deprived of the things with which we are affected, or which we love. They who are affected only with corporeal and worldly 
things, or who love such things only, grieve when they are deprived of them; but they who are affected with spiritual goods and truths and love them, grieve when they are deprived of them. Everyone's 
life is nothing but affection or love. Hence it is evident what is the state of those who are desolated as to the goods and truths with which they are affected, or which they love, namely, that their 
state of grief is more severe, because more internal; and in the deprivation of good and truth they do not regard the death of the body, for which they do not care, but eternal death. It is their state 
which is here described. [3] That it may be known who those are that can be kept by the Lord in the affection of good and truth, and thus be reformed and become spiritual, and who those are that 
cannot, we will briefly state that during childhood, while being for the first time imbued with goods and truths, everyone is kept by the Lord in the affirmative idea that what he is told and taught 
by his parents and masters is true. With those who can become spiritual men this affirmative is confirmed by means of knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones]; for whatever they afterwards learn that has 
an affinity with it, insinuates itself into this affirmative, and corroborates it; and this more and more, even to affection. These are they who become spiritual men in accordance with the essence 
of the truth in which they have faith, and who conquer in temptations. But it is otherwise with those who cannot become spiritual men. Although during their childhood these are in the affirmative, yet 
in the age that follows they admit doubts, and thus trench upon the affirmative of good and truth; and when they come to adult age, they admit negatives, even to the affection of falsity. If these should 
be brought into temptations, they would wholly yield; and on this account they are exempted from them. [4] But the real cause of their admitting doubts, and afterwards negatives, is to be found 
in their life of evil. They who are in a life of evil cannot possibly do otherwise; for as before said the life of everyone is his affection or love; and such as is the affection or love, such is the 
thought. The affection of evil and the thought of truth never conjoin themselves together. With those in whom there is an appearance of this conjunction, there is really no such conjunction, but only 
the thought of truth without the affection of it; and therefore with such persons truth is not truth, but only something of sound, or of the mouth, from which the heart is absent. Such truth even the 
worst can know, and sometimes better than others. With some also there is found a persuasion of truth, of such a nature that no one can know but that it is genuine; and yet it is not so if there is no 
life of good: it is an affection of the love of self or of the world, which induces such a persuasion that they defend it even with the vehemence of apparent zeal; nay, they will even go so far as to 
condemn those who do not receive it, or believe in the same way. But this truth is of such a quality as is the principle with each person from which it starts, being strong in proportion as the love 
of self or of the world is strong. It indeed attaches itself to evil, but does not conjoin itself with it, and is therefore extirpated in the other life. Very different is it with those who are in the 
life of good. With these truth itself has its own ground and heart, and has its life from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2689</b></p><p><b>2689.</b>
'And lifted up her voice and wept' means a further degree of grief. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'lifting up the voice and weeping' as the utmost extremity of grief, for weeping with a loud 
voice is nothing else. Described in this verse is a state of desolation of truth and of withdrawal from truths, as experienced by those who are becoming spiritual. What this state is like must be explained 
briefly: People who are not able to be reformed have no knowledge at all of what it is to grieve on account of being deprived of truths, for they imagine that no one can possibly become distressed 
for a reason such as that. The only circumstances, they believe, which can lead to such distress exist when someone is deprived of those good gifts to men that are of a bodily and worldly kind, such 
as health, position, reputation, wealth, and life. But those who are able to be reformed believe altogether differently. They are maintained by the Lord in the affection for good and in the thought 
of truth, and therefore come to be distressed when deprived of these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is well known that all distress and grief are the result of a person's being deprived of the things for which he has affection, 
that is, which he loves. Those whose affection is solely for bodily and worldly things, that is, who love solely these, grieve when deprived of them, whereas those whose affection is for spiritual 
goods and truths, and who love these, grieve when deprived of them. The life in any person is nothing else than affection or love. From this one may see the nature of the state of those who are 
desolated as regards the goods and truths for which they have affection, that is, which they love; that is to say, one may see that their state of grief, being more interior, is more severe, and that 
in being deprived of good and truth it is not death of the body which they are bothered about but eternal death. It is their state which is described here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So that it may also be known which people 
can be maintained by the Lord in the affection for good and truth and so be reformed and become spiritual, and which ones cannot, this too must be explained briefly. In childhood everyone, when being 
for the first time endowed with goods and truths, is maintained by the Lord in the affirmative attitude that anything said or taught by parents and teachers is true. With those who are able to become 
spiritual this affirmative attitude is strengthened by means of facts and cognitions, for whatever they learn and is relevant introduces itself into the affirmative outlook and strengthens it, leading 
more and more towards affection for it. These are ones who become spiritual in accordance with the essence of the truth in which they have faith, and who are victorious in temptations. But it is 
quite different with those who are not able to become spiritual. Although in childhood an affirmative attitude exists with them, when they are older they allow doubts to enter in which thus destroy the 
affirmative attitude towards good and truth. And when they reach adult years they allow denials to enter in, and even the affection for what is false to enter in. If such people were led into temptations 
they would give in completely. Consequently they are kept free from them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But the real reason why they allow doubts and subsequently denials to enter in may be traced back to their life 
of evil. People who lead a life of evil cannot possibly do otherwise. The life in any person, as has been stated, is affection or love, and as is the nature of that affection or love so is the nature 
of his thought. The affection for evil and the thought of truth never join themselves together. In cases where they seem to join themselves, they do not in fact do so, for the thought of truth exists 
without the affection for it. With such people therefore truth is not truth, but merely a sound or something on the lips, from which the heart is far away. Even very wicked people can know such truth, 
better than anybody else sometimes. Some are also so strongly persuaded by truth of that kind that no one can see it as other than genuine. But it is not genuine truth if the life of good is absent. 
It is affection belonging to self-love or love of the world which causes that strong persuasion of it, which they also defend with a vehemence that is evidence of apparent zeal; indeed they go so far 
as to condemn people who do not receive it or believe it in a similar way. But this kind of truth varies from one person to another according to his basic way of thinking, the strength of that truth depending 
on the strength of his self-love or his love of the world. It is, it is true, born together with evil, but it does not join itself to evil, and therefore in the next life is rooted out. It is 
different in the case of those who lead a life of good; in them the truth itself finds its soil, and its ability to grow, and from the Lord its life. </p>

`Et sustulit vocem et flevit': quod significet dolori ulteriorem gradum, constare potest a significatione `tollere vocem et flere' quod sit ultimum doloris, fletus enim cum alta voce non aliud est. 
 {2} Status desolationis veri, tum elongationis a veris, apud eos qui fiunt spirituales, in hoc versu descriptus est; quomodo haec se habent paucis dicendum est; illi qui non reformari possunt, nesciunt 
prorsus quid sit dolere propter id quod depriventur veris, putant quod nusquam aliquis angi possit propter tale; solum anxietatem dari posse credunt quod quis privetur bonis corporis et mundi, ut valetudine, 
honore, fama, opibus, et vita: qui autem reformari possunt, aliter prorsus credunt; detinentur ii a Domino in affectione boni et in cogitatione veri, quare in anxietatem veniunt quando illis 
privantur: [2] notum est quod omnis anxietas et dolor sit inde quod aliquis privetur illis quibus afficitur seu quae amat; qui solum afficiuntur corporeis et mundanis, seu solum talia amant, ii dolent 
quando `illis privantur; qui autem afficiuntur bonis et veris spiritualibus, et haec amant, ii dolent quando illis privantur; cujusvis vita non est nisi affectio seu amor; inde constare potest qualis 
status est eorum qui desolantur quoad bona et vera quibus afficiuntur seu quae amant, quod nempe status doloris eorum sit gravior quia interior, et in privatione boni et veri non spectant mortem corporis, 
quam nec curant, sed mortem aeternam; eorum status est qui hic describitur.  [3] Ut quoque sciatur quinam sunt qui in affectione boni et veri a Domino teneri, ac sic reformari et fieri spirituales 
possunt, et fieri non possunt, etiam paucis dicendum; unusquisque in pueritia, dum primum bonis et veris imbuitur, tenetur a Domino in affirmativo quod veram sit quod a parentibus et a magistris 
dicitur (c)et docetur; hoc affirmativum apud eos qui spirituales homines possunt fieri, per scientifica et cognitiones confirmatur, nam quicquid addiscunt, quod affine est, se insinuat affirmativo, et 
hoc corroborat, idque magis et magis usque ad affectionem {2}; hi sunt qui spirituales homines secundum veri essentiam cui fidem habent, fiunt, et qui in tentationibus vincunt.  Aliter vero se res habet 
cum illis qui non spirituales fieri possunt; hi tametsi in pueritia in affirmativo sunt, usque succedente aetate dubitativa admittunt, et sic infringunt affirmativum boni et veri; et cum adultam aetatem 
intrant, admittunt negativa, usque ad affectionem falsi; hi si in tentationes inducerentur, plane succumberent, quare etiam ab illis liberantur.  [4] Sed ipsa causa quod admittant dubitativa, et 
postea negativa, ducit omnem suam originem a vita mali; qui in vita mali sunt, nusquam aliter possunt; vita cujusvis, ut dictum, est affectio seu amor; qualis affectio seu amor, talis cogitatio; affectio 
mali et cogitatio veri nusquam se conjungunt; ubi apparent se conjungere, usque non [se] conjungunt, est cogitatio veri absque affectione ejus, quare apud eos verum non est verum, sed modo sonorum 
quoddam, seu oris, a quo cor procul abest; tale verum scire etiam possunt pessimi, et quandoque prae aliis: apud quosdam etiam datum persuasivum veri talis naturae ut nemo aliud scire possit quam quod 
sit genuinum, sed usque non est si non sit vita boni; est affectio amoris sui vel mundi quae inducit tale persuasivum, quod etiam cum vehementia apparentis Zeli defendunt, immo usque ut condemnent 
illos qui non recipiunt, aut similiter credunt; sed hoc verum est quale principium apud unumquemvis, fortius quo fortior amor sui {3} aut mundi; id quidem adnascitur malo, sed non cum malo se conjungit, 
quare etiam exstirpatur in altera vita.  Aliter apud eos qui in vita boni sunt, ipsum verum ibi suam humum, et suum cor, et a Domino suam vitam habet. 	@1 A passage similar to what follows was written 
in A at the end of 2685, but deleted. In the margin at that place is written ad finem horum verborum (see Appendix).$ 	@2 i si quid dubitativi se infert, hoc non curant, sed rejiciunt$ 	@3 et.$ </p>
