<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10315节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10315</strong>.我问他们作为世人生活时，是否对自己的身体也持有这种观念。他们说，他们星球的人根本不在乎自己的身体，只关心身体里面的灵，因为他们知道，他们的灵会活到永远，而身体则会灭亡。然而，他们并不将脸视为身体，因为属于其灵的情感就显现在他们的脸上，而由他们的情感所产生的思维则显现在他们的眼睛里。他们还说，他们星球上的许多居民都相信身体里面的灵自永恒就存在，在怀孕时就被注入身体。不过，他们补充说，他们现在知道这不是真的，并且后悔曾持有这样的谬念。</p>

I asked them whether they had been in such an idea concerning their bodies when they lived in the world as men. They said that the men of their earth make no account of their bodies, but only of the 
spirit therein, because they know that the spirit is to live forever, and that the body will perish. The face, however, they do not call the body, because the affections of their spirits appear from the 
face, and the thoughts that come from the affections, from the eyes. They also said that some in their earth believe that the spirits of their bodies have existed from eternity, and were infused into 
the body at conception; but they added that now they know that it is not so, and they repent of having been in so false an opinion. </p>

I asked them whether they had also adopted the same attitude towards their body when they lived as people in the world. They said that people belonging to their planet place no value on their body, only 
on their spirit within the body, because they know that their spirit is going to live forever and their body to perish. They do not however refer to their face as the body, because the affections 
belonging to their spirit are revealed in their face, while the thoughts resulting from their affections are revealed in their eyes. They also said that very many inhabitants of their planet believe that 
the spirits within their bodies have existed from eternity, being instilled into the body at conception. But they added that they now knew that this was untrue and that they regretted having possessed 
such a false notion.  </p>

</p><b>10315.</b>
Interrogabam illos num in tali idea de corpore suo etiam fuerint cum vixerunt homines in mundo; dicebant quod homines telluris suae nihili faciant corpus suum, sed modo spiritum in corpore, quia sciunt 
hunc victurum in aeternum et corpus periturum. Sed faciem non vocant corpus, ex causa quia affectiones spiritus eorum ex facie apparent, ac cogitationes quae ex affectionibus, ex oculis. Dicebant 
etiam quod plures eorum in tellure sua credant spiritus corporum eorum ab aeterno fuisse, infusos corpori dum concepti; sed addebant quod nunc sciant non ita esse, et quod (x)paeniteat illos in tali falsa 
opinione fuisse. </p>
