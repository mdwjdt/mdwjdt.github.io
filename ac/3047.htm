Verse 10. And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his lord, and departed, and every good of his lord was in his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, unto the city of Nahor. "The servant 
took ten camels, of the camels of his lord, and departed," signifies general Divine memory-knowledges in the natural man; "and every good of his lord was in his hand," signifies the goods and truths 
of these knowledges with it;" "and he arose" signifies elevation; "and went to Aram-naharaim," signifies the knowledges of truth therefrom; "to the city of Nahor," signifies kindred doctrinal things. </p>

{1}e camelis domini sui, et ivit' significat scientifica communia Divina in naturali homine: `et omne bonum domini sui in manu sua' significat illorum bona et vera apud illum: `et surrexit' significat
