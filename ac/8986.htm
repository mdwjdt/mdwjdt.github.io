<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8986节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8986.</strong>“我爱我的主人和我的女人孩子”表回想属灵良善时的快乐。这从“爱”、“主人”、“女人”和“孩子”的含义清楚可知：“爱”在此是指回想时的快乐，如下文所述；“主人”是指作为源头的属灵良善（参看<a href="8981.htm">8981</a>节）；“女人”是指被属灵层附上的良善（<a href="8981.htm">8981</a>节）；“孩子”是指从那良善衍生而来的良善和真理（参看<a href="8982.htm">8982</a>节）。因此，“主人，女人或妻子和孩子”合起来表示诸属灵良善。“爱”之所以表示回想这类良善时的快乐，是因为“希伯来奴仆”所代表的人是教会中那些充满教义真理，却未充满与这些真理相一致的良善之人（参看<a href="8974.htm">8974</a>，<a href="8976.htm">8976</a>节）。这些人无法充满为了良善而对真理的任何情感，只能充满为了快乐而对真理的某种情感。故此处指着这些人所说的“爱”表示回想时的快乐。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8986</b></p><p><b>8986.</b>
I love my master, my woman, and my children. That this signifies the delight of the remembrance of spiritual goods, is evident from the signification of "loving," as here being the delight of remembrance 
(of which below); from the signification of "master," as being the spiritual good which is the source (see above, n. 8981); from the signification of "woman," as being the good that is adjoined from 
the spiritual (n. 8981); and from the signification of "children," as being the goods and truths thence derived (see n. 8982); consequently by "master, woman, and children," taken together, are signified 
spiritual goods. That the delight of the remembrance of such goods is signified by "loving," is because they who were represented by the Hebrew menservants are those who within the church are 
in truths of doctrine and not in good in accordance with these truths (see n. 8974, 8976). Such cannot be affected with truth for the sake of good, but for the sake of delight; and therefore by "loving," 
here, because it is said of such, is signified the delight of remembrance. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8986</b></p><p><b>8986.</b>
'I love my master, my woman, and my children' means the delight in remembering forms of spiritual good. This is clear from the meaning of 'loving' here as the delight in remembering, dealt with below; 
from the meaning of 'master' as spiritual good from which [other forms of it spring], dealt with above in <a href="8981.htm">8981</a>; from the meaning of 'woman' as good attached by the spiritual, also dealt with above in <a href="8981.htm">8981</a>; and from the meaning of 'children' as forms of good and truths which are derived from that good, dealt with in <a href="8982.htm">8982</a>. Consequently 'master, wife, and children' in brief means spiritual forms of 
good. The reason why the delight in remembering those forms of good is meant by 'loving' is that those who were represented by 'Hebrew slaves' are people within the Church who are imbued with the truths 
of religious teachings and not with good in keeping with those truths, <a href="8974.htm">8974</a>, <a href="8976.htm">8976</a>. Such people cannot be filled with any affection for truth for the sake of good, only for the sake of delight. Therefore 
'loving' here,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> being used in reference to those people, means the delight in remembering.

`Diligo dominum meum, mulierem meam, et liberos meos' significat jucundum recordationis bonorum spiritualium; constat ex significatione `diligere' quod hic sit jucundum recordationis, de qua sequitur, 
ex significatione `domini' quod sit bonum spirituale a quo, de qua supra n.  8981, ex significatione `mulieris' quod sit bonum adjunctum a spirituali, de qua etiam supra n. 8981, et ex significatione 
`liberorum' quod sint inde bona et vera derivata, de qua n.  8982; inde per `dominum, uxorem, et liberos' in summa significantur bona spiritualia.  {1}Quod (x) jucundum recordationis illorum bonorum 
significetur per `diligere,' est quia illi qui per `servos Hebraeos' (x)repraesentati fuerunt sunt qui intra Ecclesiam in veris doctrinae et non in bono secundum illa sunt, n. 8974, 8976; tales non 
possunt affici vero propter bonum, sed propter jucundum; quapropter per `diligere' hic, quia de illis dicitur, significatur jucunditas recordationis. @1 quod eorum recordatio$ </p>
