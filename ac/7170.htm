<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7170节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于水星的灵人和居民（续）</h4><br />7170.一群水星灵曾以一个球形，接着又以一个拉长卷轴的形状出现在左边。我想知道他们想去哪里，是去这个星球还是去别处；很快我就发现他们转过身来，面向右边，然后卷起来靠近金星，在远离太阳的那一面。但一到那里，他们说，他们不想在那里，因为居民都很坏。于是，他们绕到这个星球的另一面，就是面向太阳的那一面，然后说，他们想留在那里，因为那里的居民都很好。他们到来后，我感觉我的脑子发生了显着变化，由此产生强烈的活动。由此我得出结论，住在金星那一面的金星灵与水星灵是一致的，他们与物质事物的记忆有关，而这种记忆与水星灵所构成的非物质事物的记忆一致。因此，当他们在那里时，我感觉从他们发出的活动更强烈了。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH MERCURY.      The spirits of Mercury appeared at the left in a ball, and afterward in a roll stretching a long way, and next in a mass extending 
in length; and I wondered whither they desired to go, whether to this earth or elsewhere, and presently I observed that they bent themselves back to the right, and by unrolling themselves approached 
the earth Venus, on the side that is turned away from the sun. But when they came there, they said that they did not desire to be there, because the inhabitants were evil; therefore they bent themselves 
round to the other side of that earth, which looks to the sun, and then said that they desired to stay there, because the inhabitants were good. When this had taken place, I felt in the brain 
a remarkable change, and a strong operation from there. From this it was given to conclude that the spirits of Venus who are on that side of the planet were in accord with the spirits of the planet Mercury, 
and that they have relation to the memory of material things, which agrees with the memory of immaterial things, which the spirits of Mercury constitute; and therefore a stronger operation was 
felt from them when they were there. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET MERCURY - continued </p>
<p>A group of spirits belonging to Mercury once appeared on the left in the shape of a ball, and after that in the shape of a scroll. I wondered 
where they wanted to go, whether towards our planet or another one, soon after which I noticed that they turned themselves round to face the right, and then rolled up close to the planet Venus, to 
the side away from the sun. But when they got there they said they did not wish to be there because the people were bad. They therefore bore round to the other side of that planet which faces the sun, 
where they then said they wished to stay because the people there were good. After their arrival I felt a remarkable change in my brain and powerful action as a result of it. From this I was led to 
conclude that the spirits belonging to Venus who lived on that other side of the planet were in tune with the spirits belonging to the planet Mercury, and that they correlated with the memory of material 
things. This memory harmonizes with the memory of immaterial things that the spirits belonging to Mercury constitute. This is why I felt the more powerful action by them when they were there. </p>

Continuatio de Spiritibus et de Incolis Telluris Mercurii </p>
<p>Apparebant spiritus Mercurii ad sinistrum in globo, et dein in volumine extendente se in longum; et miratus quo vellent num ad hanc tellurem 
vel alio, et mox animadvertebam quod reflecterent se dextrorsum, et {1} se {2}revolvendo approximarent ad tellurem Veneris, ad plagam ejus aversam a sole; sed cum illuc venirent, dicebant quod ibi 
esse nollent quia mali; quare se circumflectebant ad alteram partem istius telluris qua spectat solem, et tunc dicebant quod ibi morari vellent, quia illi qui ibi sunt boni.  Hoc cum factum erat, sentiebam 
in cerebro mutationem insignem et operationem fortem inde.  Ex {3}illis concludere dabatur quod spiritus Veneris qui ab {4}illa parte planetae sunt concordarent cum spiritibus planetae Mercurii, 
et quod illi referrent memoriam rerum (x)materialium, concordantem cum memoria rerum immaterialium, quam spiritus Mercurii constituunt; inde operatio fortior sentita est ab illis cum ibi essent. 	@1
