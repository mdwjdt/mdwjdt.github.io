<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8797节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8797.</strong>“凡摸这山的，必要治死他”表凡属于属灵教会的人若强行进入属天社群，都将被毁灭。这从“山”、“摸”和“必要治死他”的含义清楚可知：“山”是指爱之良善（参看<a href="8795.htm">8795</a>节），在此是指在至内层天堂的神性之爱的神性良善，因为山下的百姓代表主的属灵国度，也就是中间天堂；“摸”是指渗透到那里，在此是指强行进入，如下文所述；“必要治死他”是指被毁灭。<br />此处的情形是这样：那些属于主的属灵国度的人无法流入属天国度，因为这后者更高或更内在，而前者更低或更外在；更外在或更低之物无法流入更高或更内在之物（<a href="5259.htm">5259</a>，<a href="5779.htm">5779</a>节）。然而，有时这种事也会发生，那些在低层天堂的人设法升入高层天堂；他们这样做是出于一种源于骄傲、统治欲或嫉妒的错误欲望。那些有这种欲望和冒险精神的人也不时地被允许进来；但随后他们便吃尽苦头，充满焦虑，最终充满疼痛，而且还瞎了；他们的聪明和幸福都被摧毁了。因此，他们从那里摔了下去，仿佛濒临死亡，而且直到从天堂被摔出去才复活。<br />这就是那些属于低层天堂，出于骄傲、统治欲或嫉妒所生的欲望而强行进入高层天堂之人的命运。他们吃尽苦头的原因是，相对于他们来说，高层天堂的爱之良善就像一团吞噬的火焰，而那里的信之真理就像火光，刺瞎了那些从下面上来之人的视觉。这些就是以色列人不可摸耶和华所在的西乃山这一命令在内义上所表示的事。那些属于属天国度的人试图上到高处，直到神性那里，也会遭遇类似的命运。这样的命运还等待着那些在天堂之下、想要升入天堂的人；他们也会吃尽苦头（参看<a href="4225.htm">4225</a>，<a href="4226.htm">4226</a>，<a href="4299.htm">4299</a>，<a href="5057.htm">5057</a>，<a href="5058.htm">5058</a>节）。</p>

Everyone that toucheth the mountain, dying he shall die. That this signifies that whosoever of the spiritual church inserts himself as far as the celestial societies will perish, is evident from the 
signification of "the mountain," as being the good of love (see just above, n. 8795), here the Divine good of the Divine love in the inmost heaven, because the people that is beneath represents the spiritual 
kingdom of the Lord, which is the middle heaven; from the signification of "touching," as being to penetrate thereto, in this case to insert themselves (of which presently); and from the signification 
of "dying he shall die," as being to perish. [2] The case herein is this. They who are of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord cannot flow into the celestial kingdom, because this latter is higher 
or more interior, and the former is lower or more exterior; for what is exterior or lower cannot flow into what is higher or interior (n. 5259, 5779). Yet it sometimes happens that they who are in 
a lower heaven seek to ascend into a higher heaven, and this from a vicious desire originating in pride, in the love of dominion, or in envy. They who make the attempt from such a desire are thereupon 
let in; but they then suffer hard things, are seized with anxiety and finally with pain, and also with blindness, so that they lose both their intelligence and their happiness. Wherefore they cast themselves 
down therefrom as if about to die, nor do they recover animation until they have been cast down from heaven. [3] Such is the lot of those who from the cupidity of pride, of dominion, or of 
envy, insert themselves into a higher heaven. The reason is that relatively to them, the good of love in the higher heaven is like a consuming fire, and the truth of faith there is like a fiery light 
blinding the sight of those who rise up. These are the things meant in the internal sense by the command that the Israelitish people should not touch Mount Sinai, where Jehovah was. The case would be 
similar with those who are in the celestial kingdom, if perchance they should attempt to ascend on high to the Divine; in like manner with those who are beneath heaven, if they desire to ascend into heaven. 
(That these latter suffer hard things, see n. 4225, 4226, 4299, 5057, 5058.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8797</b></p><p><b>8797.</b>
'Everyone touching the mountain will surely die' means that anyone belonging to the spiritual Church who forces his way through to celestial [communities] will be destroyed. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'the mountain' as the good of love, dealt with just above in <a href="8795.htm">8795</a>, at this point the Divine Good of Divine Love in the inmost heaven, since the people below the mountain represent the Lord's 
spiritual kingdom, which is the middle heaven; from the meaning of 'touching' as penetrating that far, at this point forcing one's way through, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'surely dying' 
as being destroyed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation here is that those belonging to the Lord's spiritual kingdom cannot flow into the celestial kingdom since this is higher or more internal and the spiritual kingdom 
is lower or more external; for what is more external or lower cannot flow into what is higher or more internal, <a href="5259.htm">5259</a>, <a href="5779.htm">5779</a>. However it sometimes happens that those in a lower heaven seek to go up 
into a higher heaven; they seek to do so because of a wrong desire that has its origin in pride, dominion, or envy. Those who have that desire and venture up are also let in now and again; but then 
they suffer badly. They are seized by anxiety, at length by pain, and also by blindness; their intelligence is destroyed, and their happiness. On account of all this they cast themselves down from there 
as if they are about to die, and do not revive until they have been cast down out of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Such is the fate of those belonging to a lower heaven who force their way through to a higher heaven 
from a desire born of pride, dominion, or envy. The reason why they suffer badly is that the good of love in the higher heaven is comparatively like a devouring fire, and the truth of faith there 
is like fiery light blinding the sight of those coming up from below. These are the things that are meant in the internal sense by the Israelite people's being forbidden to touch Mount Sinai where Jehovah 
was. A similar fate would await those belonging to the celestial kingdom if they perhaps tried to go up above to the Divine. It also awaits those who are below heaven if they desire to go up into 
heaven; they too suffer badly, see <a href="4225.htm">4225</a>, <a href="4226.htm">4226</a>, <a href="4299.htm">4299</a>, <a href="5057.htm">5057</a>, <a href="5058.htm">5058</a>. </p>

`Omnis tangens montem moriendo morietur': quod significet quod qui ab Ecclesia spirituali usque ad [societates] caelestes se infundit pereat, constat ex (x)significatione `montis' quod sit bonum amoris, 
de qua mox supra n. 8795, hic Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris in caelo intimo, quia populus qui infra repraesentat regnum spirituale Domini, quod est caelum medium; ex significatione `tangere' quod sit 
penetrare eousque, hic infundere se, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `moriendo mori' quod sit perire. 	2 Cum hoc ita se habet: illi qui e regno spirituali Domini sunt non possunt influere in 
regnum caeleste, quia hoc est superius seu interius, et illud inferius seu exterius, {1}quod enim exterius seu inferius est non potest influere in superius seu interius, n. 5259, 5779; fit tamen quandoque 
quod qui in inferiore caelo sunt ambiant ascendere in caelum superius, et hoc ex prava cupidine quae originem {2}ducit ex fastu, ex dominatione, vel ex invidia; qui id inde tentant subinde etiam 
intromittuntur; sed tunc patiuntur dura, corripiuntur anxietate, et tandem dolore, et quoque caecitate, {3}et intelligentia illis ac felicitas perit; quapropter inde se dejiciunt sicut moribundi, nec 
animam 3 recipiunt quam cum e caelo dejecti sunt; talis sors est illis (x)qui e caelo inferiore ex cupiditate fastus, dominationis, {4}aut invidiae se infundunt in caelum superius; causa est quia {5}bonum 
amoris in illo caelo est sicut ignis consumens respective, et {6}verum fidei ibi est sicut lux ignea occaecans visum illorum qui emergunt; haec sunt quae in sensu interno {7}intelliguntur per quod 
populus Israeliticus non tangeret montem Sinai, ubi Jehovah.  Similiter se {8}haberet cum illis qui in caelesti regno sunt si (t)ascendere supra ad Divinum forte conarentur; similiter cum illis qui 
infra caelum sunt si ascendere in caelum cupiunt; quod hi dira patiantur, videatur n. 4225, 4226, 4299, 5057, 5058. 	@1 nam quod$ 	@2 a fastu aut invidia trahit$ 	@3 nam perit intelligentia illis, 
et quoque beatitudo$ 	@4 vel$ 	@5 amor$ 	@6 lux sapientiae ibi est quoque ignea respective, quae est occaecans illos$ 	@7 intelligantur$ 	@8 habet$ </p>
