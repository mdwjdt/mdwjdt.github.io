<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7044节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7044.</strong>“西坡拉就拿一块火石”表代表性教会通过真理所展示的真实性质。这从“西坡拉”的代表和“火石”的含义清楚可知：“西坡拉”在此是指代表性教会；“火石”是指信之真理。用火石刀行割礼表示从各种污秽的爱中洁净是通过信之真理实现的（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>节）；因为割礼代表从这些爱中洁净（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>节）。洁净之所以通过信之真理实现，是因为这些真理教导何为良善，何为邪恶，因而当行什么，不当行什么。当一个人知道这些真理，愿意照之行事时，他正被主引领，并通过祂的神性手段被洁净。由于信之真理教导何为邪恶，何为良善，故很明显，“西坡拉就拿一块火石”表示通过真理所展示的真实性质。“西坡拉”代表代表性教会，这一点从接下来的这几节经文明显看出来。</p>

And Zipporah took a stone. That this signifies the quality shown by the representative church by means of truth, is here evident from the representation of Zipporah, as being the representative church; 
and from the signification of a "stone," as being the truth of faith. That circumcision was performed with knives of stone, signified that purification from filthy loves was effected by means of the 
truths of faith (n. 2039, 2046, 2799); for circumcision was representative of purification from these loves (n. 2799). The reason why purification is effected by means of the truths of faith, is that 
these teach what is good, and also what is evil, and thus what ought to be done, and what ought not to be done; and when man knows these truths, and wills to act according to them, he is then led by 
the Lord, and is purified by His Divine means. As the truths of faith teach what is evil and what is good, it is evident that by "Zipporah took a stone" is signified the quality shown by means of truth. 
That Zipporah represents the representative church is evident from what follows in these verses. </p>

'And Zipporah took a flint' means that the representative Church used truth to demonstrate the actual nature. This is clear from the representation of 'Zipporah' here as the representative Church; and 
from the meaning of 'a flint' as the truth of faith. The use of knives made of flint to carry out circumcision meant the use of the truths of faith to carry out purification from filthy kinds of love, <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>; for circumcision was an act that represented purification from those kinds of love, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>. The reason why purification is effected by means of the truths of faith is that these truths 
teach what good is and also what evil is, and so what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. And when a person knows those truths and wishes to act in accordance with them, he is being led 
by the Lord and purified by the Divine means that are His. Since the truths of faith teach what evil is and what good is it is evident that 'Zipporah took a flint' means the use of truth to demonstrate 
the actual nature. The fact that 'Zipporah' represents the representative Church is clear from the things that follow in these verses. </p>

`Et accepit Zippora petram':  quod significet quale ostensum ab Ecclesia repraesentativa per verum, constat ex repraesentatione `Zipporae' hic, quod sit Ecclesia repraesentativa; et ex significatione 
`petrae' quod sit verum fidei.  Quod circumcisio facta fuerit per gladiolos petrarum, significabat quod purificatio ab amoribus spurcis fieret per vera fidei, n. (x)2039, 2046, 2799; nam circumcisio 
erat repraesentativum purificationis ab amoribus illis, {1} n. 2799.  Causa quod purificatio fiat per vera fidei, est quia haec docent quid bonum, tum quoque quid malum, ac ita quid faciendum et quid 
non faciendum; ac cum homo scit vera illa et vult facere secundum illa, tunc ducitur ille a Domino et per Divina Ipsius media purificatur.  Quia vera fidei docent quid malum et quid bonum, patet quod 
per `accepit Zippora petram' {2}significetur quale ostensum per verum.  Quod `Zippora' repraesentet Ecclesiam repraesentativam, constat ab illis quae in his versibus sequuntur. 	@1 i videatur$ 	@2
