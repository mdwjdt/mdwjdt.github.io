<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6580节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6580.</strong>“约瑟住在埃及”表来自内在的教会记忆知识的生命。这从“住”和“埃及”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“住”是指生命（参看<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>，<a href="3613.htm">3613</a>，<a href="4451.htm">4451</a>，<a href="6051.htm">6051</a>节）；“约瑟”是指内在（<a href="6499.htm">6499</a>节）；“埃及”是指教会的记忆知识（<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="6004.htm">6004</a>节）。本章前面几节论述的主题是将要重建的属灵教会；后来是外在人或属世人完全顺服于内在人或属灵人，这由约瑟的哥哥们俯伏在他面前，将自己献与他为仆为来表示；现在论述的主题则是重建之时的该教会，约瑟住在埃及，以及以法莲所生的子孙，和玛拿西的儿子玛吉所生的子孙就描述了这种重建。对作为一个属灵教会的人来说，来自内在的生命就存在于教会的记忆知识里面；因为与他同住的记忆知识变得服从，被带入秩序的状态，该状态是这样：他们接受良善与真理的流注，以至于成为来自内在的流注的容器。那些不是一个教会的人则不然，与这些人同住的记忆知识以这种方式被组织起来：肯定真理与良善的事实被赶到边缘，从而远离天堂之光；结果，之后留下来的事物成了虚假和邪恶的接受者。</p>

And Joseph dwelt in Egypt. That this signifies the life of the memory-knowledges of the church from the internal, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being life (see n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 
4451, 6051); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6499); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the memory-knowledges of the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004). In 
the preceding verses of this chapter the subject treated of is the spiritual church that was to be set up again; and after the external or natural has been made completely submissive to the internal 
or spiritual-which is signified by Joseph's brethren falling down before him and offering themselves to him for servants-the subject now treated of is this church when set up again, which is described 
in these verses by Joseph's dwelling in Egypt, and by sons being born of Ephraim, and of Machir the son of Manasseh. With the man who is a spiritual church there is life from the internal in the memory-knowledges 
of the church; for the memory-knowledges with him are made subordinate, and reduced into such order that they receive the influx of good and of truth, so as to be receptacles of influx from 
the internal. It is otherwise with those who are not a church, the memory-knowledges with these persons being so disposed that things confirmatory of truth and good have been rejected to the sides, 
thus far removed from the light of heaven; and thereafter the things that remain are receptive of falsity and evil. </p>

'And Joseph dwelt in Egypt' means the life of the Church's factual knowledge from the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling' as the life, dealt with in <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, <a href="3613.htm">3613</a>, <a href="4451.htm">4451</a>, <a href="6051.htm">6051</a>; from 
the representation of 'Joseph' as the internal, dealt with above in <a href="6499.htm">6499</a>; and from the meaning of 'Egypt' as the Church's factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="6004.htm">6004</a>. The subject in the 
previous parts of this chapter is the spiritual Church that is to be established; but now, after the external or natural has become totally submissive to the internal or spiritual, which is meant by 
the action of Joseph's brothers when they fell down before him and offered to be his slaves, the subject is that Church once it has been established. It is described in these verses by the statement 
that Joseph dwelt in Egypt and by the reference to the birth of sons descended from Ephraim and from Machir, Manasseh's son. With the person who is a spiritual Church life from the internal exists within 
the Church's factual knowledge; for the factual knowledge residing with him has been made subordinate and brought into a state of order which is such that it may receive an influx of goodness and 
truth, thus may be a receptacle of an influx from the internal. It is different with those who are not a Church. With them factual knowledge has been organized in such a way that facts which affirm what 
is true and good have been banished to the peripheries, and so are far removed from the light of heaven, and as a consequence the ones that remain are recipients of falsity and evil. </p>

`Et habitavit Joseph in Aegypto': quod significet vitam scientificorum Ecclesiae ab interno, constat ex significatione `habitare' quod sit vita, de qua n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451, 6051; ex repraesentatione 
`Josephi' quod sit internum, de qua supra n. 6499; et ex significatione `Aegypti' quod sint scientifica Ecclesiae, de qua n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004.  Agitur in praecedentibus hujus capitis de Ecclesia 
spirituali instauranda; et postquam externum seu naturale prorsus submissum est interno seu spirituali, quod significatur per quod `fratres Josephi ceciderint coram {1}Josepho, et se obtulerint 
ei in servos'; agitur nunc de Ecclesia illa instaurata, quae describitur in his versibus per quod `Josephus habitaverit in Aegypto, et quod nati sint filii ex Ephraimo, ac ex Machir filio Menashis'. 
 Apud hominem qui est Ecclesia spiritualis, est vita ab interno in scientificis Ecclesiae; nam scientifica {2}apud illum subordinata sunt, et in talem ordinem redacta ut influxum `boni et veri' recipiant, 
sic ut sint receptacula influxus ab interno.  Aliter apud illos qui non sunt {3}Ecclesiae; scientifica apud illos ita disposita sunt quod confirmantia verum et bonum rejecta sint ad latera, ita 
remota longe a luce caeli; {4}inde quae manent sunt recipientia falsi et mali. @1 eo$ @2 tunc$ @3 Ecclesia I$ @4 i rejecta sunt scientifica$ </p>
