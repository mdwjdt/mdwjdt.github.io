<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2510节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2510.</strong>“亚比米勒”是指关注理性事物的信之教义。这从以下事实清楚可知：他视撒拉为亚伯拉罕的妹子，而非他的妻子，作为妹子的撒拉表理性真理（<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。这同样从下文明显看出来；因为那里论述了信的教义，即它是源于理性事物还是源于属天之物。因此，“亚比米勒”表关注理性事物的信之教义。当只有被理智理解的东西才被承认为教义的真理，以致对属教义的一切事物的考虑都来自理性之时，就说教义关注理性事物。然而，信的教义并非来自理性，而是来自一个属天的源头，这一事实就是下文内义所教导的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2510</b></p><p><b>2510.</b>
That "Abimelech" is the doctrine of faith looking to rational things is evident from the fact that he looked upon Sarah, not as Abraham's wife, but as his sister; and by Sarah as a sister is signified 
rational truth (n. 2508). The same is also manifest from what follows; for the doctrine of faith is there treated of, as to whether it has its origin from the rational, or from the celestial. Hence 
"Abimelech" signifies the doctrine of faith looking to rational things. Doctrine is said to look to rational things when nothing is acknowledged as truth of doctrine except what can be comprehended by 
the reason, so that the consideration of all the things which are of doctrine is from the rational. Yet that the doctrine of faith is not from a rational but from a celestial origin, is taught in the 
internal sense in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2510</b></p><p><b>2510.</b>
That 'Abimelech' is the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational things becomes clear from the fact that he regarded Sarah not as Abraham's wife but as his sister, and 'Sarah when a sister' means 
rational truth, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>. The same is also evident from the verses that follow below, for there the question whether the doctrine of faith has its origin in the rational or in the celestial is the subject. 
'Abimelech' therefore means the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational things. Doctrine is said to regard rational things when nothing is acknowledged as the truth of doctrine except that 
which can be grasped by reason, so that when anything that is a matter of doctrine is looked at it is seen from the rational. But the fact that the doctrine of faith does not have a rational but a celestial 
origin is, in what follows, the teaching of the internal sense. </p>

Quod `Abimelech' sit doctrina fidei spectans rationalia constare potest ex eo quod spectaverit ad Saram, non ut Abrahami uxorem sed ut sororem, et per `Saram ut sororem' significatur verum rationale, 
n. 2508; idem quoque a sequentibus patet, nam agitur ibi de doctrina fidei, num originem trahat ex {1} rationali, vel num ex caelesti inde `Abimelech' significat doctrinam fidei spectantem rationalia. 
 Doctrina dicitur spectare rationalia, cum nihil {2} aliud verum doctrina agnoscitur quam quod ratione capi potest, sic ut intuitio omnium quae sunt doctrinae, sit ex rationali; at quod doctrina fidei 
non sit ex rationali, sed ex origine caelesti, in sequentibus, in sensu interno, docetur. 	@1 a I.$ 	@2 non.$ </p>
