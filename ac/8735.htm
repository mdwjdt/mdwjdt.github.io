<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8735节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8735.</strong>与我同在很长一段时间的木星灵告诉我另一件事，即：木星也有些人自称圣徒，他们以惩罚的威胁命令自己的家仆（他们的数量在增加）称他们为“主”。他们还禁止那些仆人崇拜宇宙之主，声称他们是主的中保，会把他们的祈求转达给宇宙之主。他们不像其他人那样称宇宙之主，就是我们的主为独一主，而是称祂为至高主，因为他们也自称主。</p>

I was further instructed by the spirits of the earth Jupiter who were with me for a considerable time, that on that earth there are also those who call themselves "saints," and who, under a penalty, 
command their servants, whom they multiply, to call them "lords." They likewise forbid them to adore the Lord of the universe, saying that they are the Lord's mediators, and that they will bring their 
supplications to the Lord of the universe. The Lord of the universe, who is our Lord, they do not call "the One Only Lord," as the rest do, but "the Supreme Lord," for the reason that they also call 
themselves lords. </p>

Another thing I was told about by the spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter who were present with me for a great length of time was that on that planet there are also those who call themselves saints 
and who under threat of punishment order their domestic servants, whom they increase in number, to call them lords. They also forbid those servants to worship the Lord of the universe, saying that 
they are the Lord's mediators and that they will convey their supplications to the Lord of the universe. They do not call the Lord of the universe, who is our Lord, the one and only Lord, as all others 
do. Instead they call Him the highest Lord, for the reason that they also call themselves lords. </p>

Porro instructus sum a spiritibus telluris Jovis, qui admodum diu apud me fuerunt, quod in illa tellure etiam sint qui se sanctos vocant, et imperant sub poena famulis suis, quos multiplicant, ut se 
dominos appellent; prohibent etiam illis ut adorent Dominum universi, dicentes quod {1}illi Domini mediatores sint, et quod supplicationes illorum ad Dominum universi allaturi sint; {2} Dominum Universi, 
Qui est Dominus noster, non vocant unicum Dominum, sicut reliqui, sed supremum Dominum; ex causa quia (t)etiam illi se dicunt (x)dominos. 	@1 ipsi$ 	@2 i hi$ </p>
