<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9773节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9773.</strong>“高五肘”表良善和真理的层级，也是足量的。这从“高”和“五”的含义清楚可知：“高”是指良善方面的层级（参看<a href="9489.htm">9489</a>节），由于这句话论及最低层天堂，故它也表示真理方面的层级，因为该天堂处于信之良善和真理，或说信之良善和真理在该天堂是首要的；“五”是指一个足够的数量（<a href="9689.htm">9689</a>节）。“高”之所以表示良善和真理方面的层级，是因为高的东西表示内在之物（<a href="1735.htm">1735</a>，<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>，<a href="4599.htm">4599</a>节）；因此，任何事物越高，就越内在。在天堂，越内在的，离主就越近；因为主在至内在，一切事物都是从至内在发出的，或说至内在之物是源头，万物都从它发出。与至内在之物的距离就是发自祂的良善和真理的层级。主因是至内在，故也是至高点，因为祂是天堂的太阳，众天堂里的一切高度皆靠这太阳存在。这解释了为何在圣言中，主被称为“至高者”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9773</b></p><p><b>9773.</b>
And the height five cubits. That this signifies the degrees of good and truth also as much as is sufficient, is evident from the signification of "height," as being degrees in respect to good (see n. 
9489), and because this is predicated of the ultimate heaven, it denotes degrees also in respect to truth, for this heaven is in the good and truth of faith; and from the signification of "five," as 
being as much as is sufficient (n. 9689). The reason why by "height" are signified degrees in respect to good and truth is that by "what is high" is signified what is internal (n. 1735, 2148, 4599); therefore 
the higher anything is, so much the more interior it is. In heaven that which is more interior is nearer to the Lord, for the Lord is in the inmost, and from the inmost all things proceed. Distances 
from the inmost are degrees of good and truth from Him. As the Lord is the inmost, He is also the Highest, for He is the Sun of heaven, from which is all height in the heavens. For this reason 
it is that the Lord is called in the Word "the Highest." </p>

'And the height five cubits' means the degrees of good and truth, also in a sufficient amount. This is clear from the meaning of 'the height' as degrees so far as good is concerned, dealt with in <a href="9489.htm">9489</a>, 
and since it has reference to the lowest heaven they are also degrees so far as truth is concerned, for the good and truth of faith are foremost in that heaven; and from the meaning of 'five' as a 
sufficient amount, dealt with in <a href="9689.htm">9689</a>. The reason why 'the height' means degrees so far as good and truth are concerned is that what is high means what is internal, <a href="1735.htm">1735</a>, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>, <a href="4599.htm">4599</a>, and therefore the 
higher anything is, the more internal it is. What is more internal in heaven is closer to the Lord; for the Lord is at the inmost point, and what is inmost is the source from which everything emanates. 
Distances away from what is inmost are degrees of good and truth emanating from Him. Since the Lord is the inmost point He is also the highest point; for He is the Sun of heaven, from which all height 
in the heavens exists. This explains why in the Word the Lord is called the Most High.  </p>

`Et altitudo quinque cubiti': quod significet gradus boni et veri etiam quantum satis, constat ex significatione `altitudinis' quod sint gradus quoad bonum, de qua n. 9489, et quia de caelo ultimo praedicatur, 
sunt etiam gradus quoad verum, nam id caelum in bono et vero fidei est; et ex significatione `quinque' quod sint quantum satis, de qua n. 9689; quod per `altitudinem' significentur gradus 
quoad bonum et verum, est quia per altum significatur internum, n. 1735, 2148, 4599, ideo quo altius eo interius, interius in caelo est propius ad Dominum, nam Dominus est in intimo, et ab intimo procedunt 
omnia; distantiae ex intimo sunt gradus boni et veri ab Ipso; quia Dominus est intimum, etiam est Altissimum, est enim Sol caeli, a quo omnis altitudo in caelis {1}; inde est quod Dominus in Verbo 
dicatur Altissimus. @1 After Altissimus$ </p>
