<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第990节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>990.</strong>“连土地上爬出的一切”表对良善的情感。这既可从前文，也可从它们所爬出的“土地”的含义清楚看出来。从前文清楚看出，是因为那里论述了重生之人所战胜的邪恶和虚假，因而被交付在他手里的对良善的情感。从它们所爬出的“土地”的含义清楚看出，则因为“土地”一般表教会成员和凡构成教会之物，因而在此表凡由主通过内在人在外在人中所产生之物。土地本身处于外在人中，就在他的情感和记忆中。表面上看，好象是人产生了良善，故经上说“土地上爬出的一切”。但这只是表象，事实上，一切良善皆通过内在人产生，因为如前所述，若非源于主，就不会有任何善与真之物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]990.</strong> As for everything that the ground causes to creep out symbolizes a passion for what is good, as suggested both by remarks above and by the symbolism of the ground from which those animals are produced or creep out. Remarks above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_990/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_986" target=_top>986-989</a>] suggest this symbolism because the subject there is evil and falsity, which the reborn person gains control over. The subject here, then, is the passion for good that is given into such a person's hands. As for the symbolism of the ground from which those animals are produced or creep out, the ground in a general sense means the people of the church and any quality that exists in it. So in the present verse it means whatever the Lord produces in the outer self by way of the inner. The actual ground is in the outer self — in the feelings and the memory of the outer self.<br />Since we seem to produce good results ourselves, it says, "Everything that the ground causes to creep out." This is an appearance, however. It is the Lord working through our inner self who does so since, to repeat, nothing good or true exists except from the Lord. </p>

Even to everything that the ground maketh to creep forth. That this signifies affections of good is evident both from what precedes and from the signification of the "ground" from which they are produced 
or creep forth; from what precedes, since there evils and falsities are treated of, over which the regenerate man rules, and therefore here affections of good, which are given into his hands; and 
from the signification of the "ground" from which they are produced or creep forth, since the "ground" is in general the man of the church and whatever is of the church, and thus here whatever is produced 
by the Lord through the internal man in the external. The ground itself is in the external man, in his affections and memory. It appears as if man produced what is good, and therefore it is said 
"everything that the ground maketh to creep forth;" but this is only the appearance; good is produced through the internal man by the Lord, since, as has been said, there is nothing of good and truth 
except from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 990</b></p><p><b>990.</b>
'Even to everything which the ground causes to creep forth' means affections for good. This is clear both from what has gone before and also from the meaning of 'the ground' from which they are produced 
or creep forth. From what has gone before where the evils and falsities over which the regenerate person rules are the subject, it is clear that the affections for good which are given into his hands 
are therefore the subject here. And from the meaning of 'the ground' from which they are produced or creep forth - 'the ground' being in general the member of the Church and whatever constitutes the 
Church - it is clear that whatever is produced in the external by the Lord by way of the internal man is therefore meant here. The ground itself is situated in the external man - in his affections 
and in his memory. The reason why it is said, 'Everything that the ground causes to creep forth', is that it seems as though man himself produced goods. But that is the appearance. In reality all good 
derives from the Lord by way of the internal man, for as stated, nothing good or true exists unless it derives from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 990</b>
</p><b>990.</b>
'Ad omne quod prorepere facit humus': quod significet affectiones boni, constat tam ab illis quae praecedunt quam a significatione 'humi' e qua producuntur seu prorepunt; ab illis quae praecedunt, quod 
ibi de malis et falsis actum, super quae dominaretur homo regeneratus, hic ideo de affectionibus boni quae ei in manus dantur; a significatione 'humi' e qua producuntur seu prorepunt, 'humus' est 
in genere homo Ecclesiae et quicquid est Ecclesiae; proinde hic quicquid a Domino per internum hominem producitur in externo; ipsa humus est in externo homine, in ejus affectionibus et in ejus memoria: 
quia apparet sicut homo produceret bona, ideo dicitur 'omne quod humus prorepere facit': sed est apparentia, est per internum hominum a Domino, nam, ut dictum, nihil boni et veri nisi a Domino </p>
