<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1638节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1638.</strong>灵人说话时所用的话语，也就是他们从人的记忆中唤起或提取、以之为自己的话语都是经过精心挑选的，而且清楚明了，富有意义，发音清晰，适合当时的主题。说来奇妙，他们比这个人本人还知道如何更快更好地挑选词语。事实上，如前所述，他们熟悉这些话语的各种含义，能立刻运用它们，无需事先考虑。至于原因，就象前面说的，构成其语言的观念只流入适合的话语中。这种情形几乎就像人在说话时完全没有考虑他所使用的话语，只考虑这些话语的含义；然后，根据含义，他的思想自然而然地立刻落入这些话语中。产生这些话语的，正是内在含义。灵人的言语也在于这样的内在含义，只是更精妙、更完美。人通过这种内在含义与灵人交流，尽管他没有意识到这一点。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1638.</strong> The words they use 钬?that is, the words they stir up or retrieve from our memory and presume to be their own 钬?are well chosen, clear, meaningful, distinctly enunciated, and relevant. Surprising to say, the spirits are smarter and faster at choosing words than we are ourselves. As a matter of fact (and this has been demonstrated to me), they grasp a word's various shades of meaning and apply them immediately, without any forethought. The reason, again, is that the thoughts composing their language flow only into suitable words.<br />The situation is almost the same as the times when we speak without thinking about the words and focus solely on the meaning of the words. Under those circumstances, our thought falls quickly and easily into phrasing that accords with our meaning. It is the inner meaning that produces the words. The same kind of inner meaning, but even more subtly nuanced and refined, is what the language of spirits consists in, and by it we communicate with them, although we are unaware of it. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1638</b></p><p><b>1638.</b>
The words which they speak, that is, which they call up or bring forth from the man's memory, and suppose to be their own, are well chosen and clear, full of meaning, distinctly pronounced, and applicable 
to the subject; and, wonderful to say, they know how to choose the words better and more promptly than the man himself; and as has been shown, they are even acquainted with the various significations 
of the words, and instantly apply them, without any premeditation, for the reason, as before said, that the ideas of their language flow solely into words that are fitting. The case with this is 
nearly like that of a man who speaks without any thought of the words he is using, being simply in the meaning of the words; then, in accordance with the meaning, his thought falls readily and spontaneously 
into words; the inner meaning is that which calls forth the words. In such an internal meaning, only one still more subtle and excellent, does the speech of spirits consist; and through this a 
man communicates with spirits, although he is unaware of it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1638</b></p><p><b>1638.</b>
The words used by spirits when they speak, that is, those which they call up or draw out from a person's memory and imagine to be their own, are well chosen and clear, full of meaning, clearly pronounced, 
and applicable to the subject. And what is amazing, they know how to choose their words better and more immediately than the person himself does. Indeed, as has been shown, they are acquainted with 
the various meanings which the words carry and which they apply in an instant and without any forethought, the reason being, as has been stated, that the ideas of which their language is composed 
flow into no other words than those that are appropriate. It is very much as when a person is speaking, yet gives no thought to the words that he is using but is intent solely on the meaning which they 
express. His thought falls, in accordance with the meaning, immediately and spontaneously into words. It is the meaning lying within which produces the words that are used; and it is in a similar, yet 
finer and more perfect, inward meaning that the speech of spirits consists. It is through this inward meaning that man, though he is not aware of it, communicates with spirits </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1638</b>
</p><b>1638.</b>
Voces quibus loquuntur, hoc est, quas excitant seu depromunt e memoria hominis, et putant esse suas, sunt electae et clarae, sensu plenae, distincte pronuntiatae, ad rem applicabiles, et mirum, melius 
et promptius sciunt eligere voces quam ipse homo; immo quod ostensum, vocum vanas significationes norunt, quas momento applicant absque ulla praemeditatione ex causa, ut dictum, quia influunt ideae 
eorum linguae non nisi quam in eas voces quae aptabiles sunt: se habet hoc paene sicut dum homo loquitur et nihil cogitat de vocibus, sed solum est in sensu vocum, tunc secundum illum cadit cogitatio 
prompte et sponte in voces; est sensus internus qui producit voces; in sensu tali interno adhuc subtiliore et excellentiore consistit loquela spirituum, per quem homo quamvis hoc nescit, communicat cum 
spiritibus. </p>
