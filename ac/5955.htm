<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5955节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5955.</strong>“惟独给便雅悯三百锭银子”表居间层获得一个完整数额的源于良善的真理。这从“便雅悯”和约瑟的代表，以及“三百”和“银子”的含义清楚可知：“便雅悯”是指居间层（参看<a href="5600.htm">5600</a>，<a href="5631.htm">5631</a>，<a href="5639.htm">5639</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>，<a href="5822.htm">5822</a>节）；约瑟，即“给”的人，是指内在良善（<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5827.htm">5827</a>，<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）；“三百”是指一个完整的数额，如下文所述；“银子”是指真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）。由此明显可知，“惟独给便雅悯三百锭银子”表示他赋予居间层一个完整数额的源于良善的真理；因为“便雅悯”所代表的居间层是经由从内在属天层进入它的流注而来的内层真理（<a href="5600.htm">5600</a>，<a href="5631.htm">5631</a>节）。“三百”之所以表示一个完整的数额，是因为这个数字是三和一百的乘积，而“三”表示完整之物（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>节），“一百”表示大量（<a href="4400.htm">4400</a>节）。事实上，复合数的含义从简单的数字，就是它们的因数可以看出来。<br />在圣言的别处所提到的“三百”也具有类似含义，如：<br />挪亚的方舟长三百肘。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创6.15.htm">6:15</a>）<br />以及基甸击杀米甸人所用的三百人，关于他们，经上在士师记上说：<br />用手捧到嘴边舔水的，总数共有三百人；耶和华对基甸说，我要用这舔水的三百人将米甸人交在你手中。基甸将三百人分作三队，把角和空瓶交在各人手里，瓶中有火把。他们吹那三百枝角的时候，耶和华使各人的剑攻击他的同伴和全营。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士7.6.htm">7:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士7.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士7.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士7.22.htm">22</a>）<br />此处“三百人”也表示一个完整数额，这三百人所分作的“三队”所表相同；“一百”，也就是每队的数字，表示大量或足够，因而表示他们足以击杀米甸人。此外，在这段描述中，每一个细节都是代表，如：从用手捧到嘴边舔水的人当中选出来的人；每个人都拿着一枝角和个内有火把的瓶子。这是因为他们所要攻击的“米甸人”代表因没有生命的良善在里面，故而并非真理的真理。蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在别处解释这类细节。数字也是代表，这一事实从其它许多经文明显看出来，如约书亚记中的数字“七”，当时他们要占领耶利哥；那时，经上吩咐七个祭司要拿七个羊角走在约柜前，到第七日要绕城七次（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.4.htm">6:4</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5955</b></p><p><b>5955.</b>
And to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver. That this signifies that the intermediate had fullness of truth from good, is evident from the representation of Benjamin, as being the intermediate 
(see n. 5600, 5631, 5639, 5688, 5822); from the representation of Joseph, who "gave," as being internal good (n. 5826, 5827, 5869, 5877); from the signification of "three hundred," as being what 
is full (of which below); and from the signification of "silver," as being truth (n. 1551, 2954, 5658). From all this it is plain that by "he gave to Benjamin three hundred pieces of silver" is signified 
that he gave to the intermediate fullness of truth from good; for the intermediate which Benjamin represents is interior truth through influx from the internal celestial (n. 5600, 5631). That "three 
hundred" signifies what is full, is because this number arises from three and a hundred by multiplication, and "three" signifies what is full (n. 2788, 4495) and a "hundred" signifies much (n. 4400); 
for what compound numbers involve is seen from the simple numbers from which they are. [2] "Three hundred" also involves a like meaning where it is mentioned elsewhere in the Word, as that      
The ark of Noah was three hundred cubits in length (Gen. 6:15); </p>
<p>also that there were three hundred men through whom Gideon smote Midian, of whom it is written in the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     The number 
of them that lapped in their hand at their mouth, was three hundred men. Jehovah said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I give Midian into thine hand. Gideon divided the three hundred 
men into three troops, and he gave a trumpet into the hand of each of them, and empty pitchers, and torches in the midst of the pitchers. When they sounded with the three hundred trumpets, Jehovah 
set every man's sword against his fellow, and against the whole camp (Judg. 7:6, 7, 16, 22); </p>
<p>by the "three hundred men" here also is signified what is full, as also by the three troops into which these 
three hundred were divided; and by the "hundred" which was the number of each troop is signified much and enough, consequently that they would be sufficient against Midian. Moreover all these things 
were representative, namely, that those were taken who lapped water in the hand; that each one had a trumpet, and pitchers in which were torches; and this because by Midian, against whom they were 
going, was represented truth which was not truth, because there was no good of life. But each of these things will of the Lord's Divine mercy be treated of elsewhere. That numbers also were representative, 
is evident from many other passages, as the number "seven" in Joshua, when they took Jericho; for it was then commanded that seven priests should bear seven jubilee trumpets before the ark, and 
that on the seventh day they should compass the city seven times (Josh. 6:4). </p>

'And to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver' means that to the intermediary a complete amount of truth from good was imparted. This is clear from the representation of 'Benjamin' as the intermediary, 
dealt with in <a href="5600.htm">5600</a>, <a href="5631.htm">5631</a>, <a href="5639.htm">5639</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>, <a href="5822.htm">5822</a>; from the representation of Joseph, the one who 'gave', as internal good, dealt with in <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5827.htm">5827</a>, <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>; from the meaning of 'three hundred' 
as a complete amount, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>. From all this it is evident that 'to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver' 
means that he imparted to the intermediary a complete amount of truth from good; for the intermediary, represented by 'Benjamin', is interior truth, through an influx into it from the internal celestial, <a href="5600.htm">5600</a>, <a href="5631.htm">5631</a>. The reason why 'three hundred' means a complete amount is that this number is the product of three multiplied by a hundred -'three' meaning what is complete, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, and 'a hundred' 
meaning much, <a href="4400.htm">4400</a>. For the meaning held by compound numbers is clear from the simple numbers that are their factors. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Three hundred' holds a similar meaning when mentioned elsewhere in 
the Word, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%206:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 6:15</a>, where it says that Noah's ark was three hundred cubits long, also in the reference to the three hundred men whom Gideon used to strike a blow at Midian, spoken of in Judges 
as follows, </p>
<p>The number of those who lapped in their hand to their mouth was three hundred men. Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who were lapping I will give Midian into your hand. Gideon 
divided the three hundred men into three lines of battle, and he put a trumpet into the hand of each one of them, and empty water-pots, and torches in the middle of the water-pots. When they sounded 
the blast on the three hundred trumpets, Jehovah set the sword of [each] man against his companion and against the whole camp. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%207:6-8,%2016,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 7:6-8, 16, 22</a>. </p>
<p>By 'the three hundred men' in this description 
too a complete amount is meant, and the same is meant by 'three lines of battle' into which the three hundred were divided. And by 'a hundred', the number in each line of battle, is meant much or enough, 
consequently that there were enough men to stand against Midian. Besides, every detail in this description was representative - the selection of those who lapped the water in their hand; the trumpet 
given to each man; and the water-pots with the torches inside them. This was so because 'Midian', whom they were opposing, represented truth that was not truth because there was no goodness of life 
in it. But such details will in the Lord's Divine mercy be explained elsewhere. The fact that numbers too were representative is evident from many other places, for example the number seven in Joshua, 
when they were going to capture Jericho. The command was given for seven priests to carry seven trumpets of rejoicing in front of the Ark; and on the seventh day they were to go round the city seven 
times, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%206:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 6:4</a>. </p>

`Et Benjamini dedit trecentos argenti': quod significet quod medio plenum veri ex bono, constat a repraesentatione `Benjaminis' quod sit medium, de qua n. 5600, 5631, 5639, 5688, 5822; ex repraesentatione 
`Josephi' qui dedit, quod sit bonum internum, de qua n. 5826, 5827, 5869, 5877; ex significatione 'trecentorum' quod sint plenum, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione argenti' quod sit verum, 
de qua n. 1551, 2954, 5658; ex his patet quod per `Benjamini dedit trecentos argenti' significetur quod medio donaverit plenum veri ex bono, (m)est enim medium quod `Benjamin' repraesentat, verum interius 
per influxum a caelesti interno,(n) n. 5600, 5631. Quod `trecenti' sint plenum, est quia exsurgunt ex tribus et ex centum per multiplicationem, et `tria' significant plenum, n. 2788, 4495, et `centum' 
significant multum, n. 4400; quid enim numeri compositi involvunt, constat ex simplicibus a quibus sunt. [2] Trecenti ubi alibi in Verbo nominantur, etiam simile involvunt, sicut quod `arca Noe 
esset longitudine trecentorum cubitorum', Gen. vi 15: tum quod `trecenti viri essent per quos Gideon percuteret (x)Midianem', de quibus {1} in Libro Judicum, Erat numerus lambentium in manu sua ad os 
suum, trecenti  viri: . . . dixit Jehovah ad Gideonem, Per trecentos viros, qui fuerunt lambentes, . . . dabo Midianem in manum tuam. . . . Divisit Gideon trecentos viros in tria agmina, et dedit buccinam 
in manum uniuscujusque eorum, et hydrias vacuas, et faces in medio hydriarum. . . . Cum clangerent trecentis buccinis, posuit Jehovah gladium viri contra socium illius, et contra universa castra, 
vii 6-8, 16, 22; </p>
<p>per `trecentos viros' ibi etiam significatur plenum, ut quoque per `tria agmina' in quae trecenti illi divisi sunt; et per `centum' qui erat numerus cujusvis agminis, significatur 
multum ac satis, consequenter quod sufficerent contra Midianem; (m)praeterea, repraesentativa erant omnia illa, nempe quod assumpti qui lamberent aquam in manu; quod buccina unicuique; quod (x)hydriae 
in quibus faces; et hoc quia per 'Midianem', contra quem irent, repraesentabatur verum quod non verum, quia non bonum vitae; sed de singulis his, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi;(n) {2}quod numeri 
etiam repraesentativi fuerint, patet ex pluribus aliis locis, ut quod septem apud Joshuam cum caperent Jerichuntem, {3}tunc enim mandatum ut, Septem sacerdotes portarent septem buccinas jubilantium 
coram arca: quod die septimo circumirent urbem septem vicibus, vi 4{4}. @1 i ita$ @2 ita apud populum illum, omnia et singula usque ad numeros repraesentativa fuerunt, ut a pluribus patet, sicut$ @3
