<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10255节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10255</strong>.“一半，就是二百五十”表相应的量。这从系之前数字的一半的数字的含义清楚可知，系前一个数字的一半的数字是指在某种程度上存在之物，以及足够的量，或目的或功用所需的量，因而也指相应的量。正因如此，“二百五十”因是之前数字的一半，也就是说，是数字“五百”的一半，故表示相应的量。举个例子有助于阐明这一切。以数字“十”为例。当这个数字表示所有人时，它的一半，或五就表示他们当中的一些人；当十表示完整或完全之物时，五就表示一个足够的量；但当十表示大量时，五就表示些许等等。其它所有数字在减半时也是这种情况。“五”表示人们当中的一些，以及在某种程度上存在之物，或些许，同样表示一个足够的量和目的或功用所需的量（参看<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="5956.htm">5956</a>，<a href="9102.htm">9102</a>，<a href="9689.htm">9689</a>节）。因此，当“十”表示所有人，完整或完全之物，或大量时，“五”的各种含义都与数字“十”的含义有关。“五十”相对于“一百”、“二百五十”相对于“五百”的含义也一样。数字是大还是小则无所谓；大数字和构成它们的小数字具有同样的含义（参看<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）；在圣言中，数字表示属灵的真实事物（参看<a href="9488.htm">9488</a>，<a href="10127.htm">10127</a>节提到的地方）。由此可见，现在这个数字，就是之前数字的一半，并非表示对内层真理的感知相对于对外层真理的感知是一半，而是表示相应的量。天上的事物不像地上的事物那样可以测量和数算，因为天上没有空间和时间，取而代之的是状态，状态的性质和数量不是用任何数算来感知的。数算和测量与诸如属于时空的那类事物，因而与那些适合自然界的最低层的事物有关。</p>

The half thereof, two hundred and fifty. That this signifies the corresponding quantity, is evident from the signification of a number which is the half of a preceding one, as being somewhat, and as 
much as is sufficient, or as much as is for use, thus also as much as corresponds. Hence it is that "two hundred and fifty," being the half of the previous number "five hundred," signifies the corresponding 
quantity. How the case herein is can be seen from examples. Take for example the number "ten." When this number signifies all, then the half of it, or "five," signifies some; when "ten" signifies 
what is full, then "five" signifies as much as is sufficient; but when "ten" signifies much, "five" signifies somewhat; and so on. The case is the same with all other numbers when halved. (That "five" 
signifies some, also somewhat, and likewise as much as is sufficient, and as much as is for use, see n. 4638, 5708, 5956, 9102, 9689), thus with variety relatively to the number "ten," when this signifies 
all, what is full, or much. It is similar with the signification of "fifty" relatively to a "hundred," and of "two hundred and fifty" relatively to "five hundred;" it does not matter whether 
a number is greater or less, seeing that the greater numbers have a like signification with the less from which they are composed (see n. 5335, 5708, 7973; and that numbers in the Word signify real things, 
see the places cited in n. 9488, 10127). From all this it can be seen that the present number, which is half of the previous one, does not signify half the perception of interior truth relatively 
to the perception of exterior truth; but a corresponding quantity. For things in the heavens are not measured and numbered as are things on earth, because in the heavens there are no spaces, or times, 
but instead thereof states, which are perceived in respect to their quality and quantity, without regard to any numbering. For numbering and measurement involve such things as belong to space and time, 
thus which are proper to nature in its ultimates. </p>

'Half of that, two hundred and fifty' means the corresponding amount. This is clear from the meaning of the number that is 'half of the one before' as that which exists in some measure, also a sufficient 
amount or the amount needed for the purposes to be served, thus also the corresponding amount. So it is that 'two hundred and fifty', being half of the number before, that is to say, half of the 
number 'five hundred', means the corresponding amount. Examples will help to clarify all this. Take the number 'ten'. When this number means all of the people, half of it or five means some of them; when 
ten means what is complete, five means a sufficient amount; but when ten means that which is much, five means some; and so on. The situation is similar with all other numbers when they are halved. 
Regarding 'five', that it means some of the people, also that which exists in some measure, as well as a sufficient amount and the amount needed for the purposes to be served, see <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="5956.htm">5956</a>, <a href="9102.htm">9102</a>, <a href="9689.htm">9689</a>. Thus its various meanings are related to those of the number 'ten', when this means all of the people, what is complete, or else that which is much. Like meanings accompany fifty in relation 
to a hundred, and two hundred and fifty in relation to fifty. It makes no difference whether the number is large or small; large numbers have a similar meaning to the smaller ones which are their factors, 
see <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, and numbers in the Word mean spiritual realities, see in the places referred to in <a href="9488.htm">9488</a>, <a href="10127.htm">10127</a>. From all this it becomes clear that the present number, which is half of the 
one before, does not mean half of the perception of interior truth in relation to the perception of exterior truth, but the corresponding amount. Things in heaven are not measured and counted as things 
are on earth; for in heaven there are no spatial distances or periods of time, but states instead, the nature and amount of which are perceived without regard to any kind of numbering. Counting and 
measuring are connected with things such as belong to space and time, thus with those that belong properly to the lowest levels of the natural order.  </p>

`Dimidium ejus quinquaginta et ducenta': quod significet quantum correspondens, constat ex significatione numeri `dimidii prioris' quod {1}sit aliquid, et quantum satis, seu quantum ad usus, ita quoque 
quantum correspondens; inde est quod `quinquaginta et ducenta' quia sunt dimidium prioris, nempe dimidium numeri quingenta, sint quantum correspondens. {2}Quomodo cum hoc se habet, constare potest 
ab exemplis; sit numerus decem pro exemplo: cum hic numerus significat omnes, tunc dimidium ejus seu quinque significant aliquos, cum decem significant plenum, tunc quinque significant quantum satis, 
cum autem decem significant multum, quinque significant aliquid, et sic porro; similiter se habet cum reliquis numeris cum dimidiantur; quod `quinque' significent aliquos, tum aliquid, ut et quantum 
satis, et quantum ad usus, videatur n. 4638, 5708, 5956, 9102, 9689, ita cum varietate respective ad numerum decem, cum hic significat omnes, {3}plenum, aut multum; {4}similia significant quinquaginta 
respective ad centum, {5}et similia quinquaginta ducenta respective ad quingenta; sive numerus major sit sive minor, nihil interest, quoniam numeri majores simile significant cum minoribus (c)a quibus 
sunt, videatur n. 5335, 5708, 7973; et quod numeri {6}in Verbo significent res, in locis citatis n. 9488, 10,127. Ex his constare potest quod hic numerus, qui est dimidius prioris, non significet dimidium 
perceptionis veri interioris respective ad perceptionem veri exterioris, sed quantum correspondens; nam res in {7}caelis non mensurantur et numerantur sicut res in terris, quoniam in caelis non 
sunt spatia nec tempora, sed loco illorum status, qui percipiuntur quoad quale et quantum, absque respectu ad aliquam numerationem; numeratio enim et mensuratio involvunt talia quae spatii et quae temporis 
sunt, ita quae propria naturae in ultimis. @1 sint$ @2 Hoc constare potest a numeris minoribus, nam numeri majores et minores similem rationem habent, cum numeris minoribus ita se habet, ut pro 
exemplo cum decem; cum hic numerus significat omnes, tunc dimidium ejus seu quinque significant aliquos, cum decem significant multum tunc quinque significant aliquid, et cum decem significant plenum 
tunc quinque significant quantum satis, seu quantum ad usus. [Numeri sequentes in una serie, respectum habent ad praecedentem also written in m of this  .]$ @3 multum, aut plenum$ @4 simile significat$ @5
