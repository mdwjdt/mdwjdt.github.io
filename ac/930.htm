<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第930节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>930.</strong>创世记8:22．尽地所有的日子，播种与收割、冷与热、夏与冬、昼与夜，就永不停息了。<br />“尽地所有的日子”表整个时间。“播种与收割”表要重生之人，因而表教会。“冷与热”表正在重生之人的状态，在接受信和仁方面，他的状态类似于冷和热，“冷”表无信和仁，“热”表有信和仁。“夏与冬”表重生之人在属其新意愿之物方面的状态，该状态的交替如同夏与冬。“昼与夜”表这个重生之人在属其觉知之物方面的状态，该状态的交替如同昼与夜。“就永不停息了”表整个时间都会是这样。</p>

"Throughout all the days of the earth to come, sowing and reaping and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night will not end."<br />Throughout all the days of the earth to come symbolizes all time. Sowing and reaping symbolizes the regenerating person and so the church. Cold and heat symbolizes the condition of a person who is regenerating, which is cold and hot toward the acceptance of faith and charity; cold symbolizes no faith or charity but heat symbolizes faith and charity. Summer and winter symbolizes the condition of an already-regenerate person in respect to new movements of the will, which alternate the way summer and winter do. Day and night symbolizes the condition of this same regenerate person in respect to concepts in the intellect, which alternate the way day and night do. They will not end is the fact that this will happen throughout all time. </p>

Verse 22. During all the days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease. "During all the days of the earth" signifies all time; 
"seed-time and harvest" signifies the man who is to be regenerated, and hence the church; "cold and heat" signifies the state of the man when he is being regenerated, which is like this in respect to 
the reception of faith and charity; "cold" signifies no faith and charity, "heat" faith and charity; "summer and winter" signifies the state of the regenerate man in respect to what is of his new will, 
the alternations of which are as summer and winter; "day and night" signifies the state of the same regenerate man in respect to what is of his understanding, the alternations of which are as day and 
night; "shall not cease" means that this shall be the case in all time. </p>

Verse 22 During all the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease. </p>
<p>'During all the days of the earth' means the whole of time. 
'Seedtime and harvest' means the person who is to be regenerated, and consequently the Church. 'Cold and heat' means the state of the person who is being regenerated, which, as regards reception 
of faith and charity, resembles cold and heat, 'cold' meaning when faith and charity do not exist, 'heat' however when they do. 'Summer and winter' means the state of a regenerate person as regards things 
belonging to his new will, which by turns come and go in the way that summer and winter do. 'Day and night' means the state of the same person, that is, of one who is regenerate, as regards things 
belonging to his understanding, which alternate as day and night do. 'They will not cease' means that this will be so for the whole of time. </p>

Vers. 22.  Adhuc omnibus diebus terrae, sementis et messis, et frigus et aestus, et aestas et hiems, et dies et nox, non cessabunt. 'Adhuc omnibus diebus terrae' significant omne tempus: 'sementis et 
messis' significant hominem regenerandum, et inde Ecclesiam: 'frigus et aestus' significant statum hominis qui regeneratur, qui talis quoad recipiendum fidem et charitatem; 'frigus' significat nullam 
fidem et charitatem; 'aestus' autem fidem et charitatem: 'aestas et hiems' significant statum hominis regenerati quoad nova ejus voluntaria, quorum vices se habent sicut aestas et hiems: 'dies et nox' 
significant statum ejusdem, seu regenerati, quoad intellectualia, quorum vices se habent sicut dies et nox: 'non cessabunt' est quod hoc omni tempore. </p>
