<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6534节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6534.</strong>“马兵”表理智概念。这从“马兵”的含义清楚可知，“马兵”是指属于理解力的事物，因为“马”表示理解力（参看<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>节）。“马兵”表示属于理解力或领悟力的事物，这一点从以下经文进一步看出来：<br />耶和华独自引导他，耶和华使他乘驾地的高处。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.12.htm">32:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这论及古教会；“使他乘驾地的高处”表示赋予卓越、高级的理解力。<br />诗篇：<br />在你的威严中爬上你的战车，乘上真理、柔和、公义的道，你的右手必指教你奇妙的事。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.4.htm">45:4</a>）<br />这论及主；“乘上真理的道（或圣言）”表示拥有对真理的纯正理解。<br />你们当歌颂神，赞美祂的名；尊崇那位驾云的，祂的名是耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.4.htm">68:4</a>）<br />这也论及主；“云”表示圣言的字义（参看创世记18章序言，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>e节）；“驾云”是指在内义中，内义里面的真理就在它所能带来的一切聪明和智慧之中。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />到那日，我必使一切马匹惊惶，使骑马的颠狂。我必张开眼睛看顾犹大家，使万民的一切马匹瞎眼。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.4.htm">12:4</a>）<br />“马匹”表示理解力；“骑马的”或“马兵”表示领悟力。谁看不出“马匹”在此不是指马，“骑马的”也不是指骑马的人；而是指诸如能被惊惶和颠狂，以及瞎眼击打的某种事物？显然，这种事物属于理解力或领悟力。<br />“马匹”和“马兵”表示理智概念，在反面意义上表示推理和由此而来的虚假，这一点可见于启示录：<br />我就观看，见有一匹白马；骑在马上的拿着弓，并有冠冕赐给他。他便出来，胜了又要胜。就另有一匹马出来，是红的，有权柄给了那骑马的，可以从地上夺去太平，使他们彼此相杀，又有一把大剑赐给他。我就观看，见有一匹黑马；骑在马上的，手里拿着天平。我就观看，见有一匹灰色马；骑在马上的，名字叫作死。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.2.htm">6:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处“马”和“骑马的”表示诸如与由真理构成的理解力有关的那类事物，在反面意义上表示诸如与由虚假构成的理解力有关的那类事物，这从一切细节明显看出来。“白马和骑在它上面的”表示由从圣言所获得的真理所构成的理解力；“骑在白马上的”是指圣言方面的主，这在启示录（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.16.htm">16</a>）已明确指出。“红马和骑在它上面的”表示由恶欲所产生的推理，这些推理向出自圣言的真理施暴；“黑马和骑在它上面的”表示摧毁理解真理的能力；而“灰色马和骑在它上面的”表示由这种摧毁所导致的诅咒。<br />就反面意义而言，“马”和“马兵”表示败坏的理解力和它所产生的虚假，如以西结书：<br />阿荷拉归我之后行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是总督和领袖，他们都是可爱的少年人、骑着马的兵。她妹妹阿荷利巴贪恋亚述人，总督和领袖，就是她的邻舍，就是穿极华美的衣服、骑着马的兵，他们都是可爱的少年人。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“阿荷拉”表示败坏的属灵教会，就是“撒玛利亚”；“阿荷利巴”表示败坏的属天教会，就是“耶路撒冷”；因为属于撒玛利亚的以色列人代表属灵教会，而属于耶路撒冷的犹太人代表属天教会。“亚述”和“亚述人”表示反对信之真理的推理（<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；“骑着马的兵”表示败坏的理解力，虚假由此产生。<br />哈巴谷书：<br />我必兴起迦勒底人，就是那残忍暴躁的民族，向宽阔之地进发，占据那不属自己的住处；他们的马比豹更快，比晚上的豺狼更猛。他们的马兵散开，马兵都从远方而来。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.6.htm">1:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“迦勒底人”表示那些陷入虚假，但外在看似处于真理的人，因而表示对真理的亵渎，而“巴比伦”表示对良善的亵渎（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1368.htm">1368</a>节）。“向宽阔之地进发”表示摧毁真理。“宽阔之地”表示真理（参看<a href="3433.htm">3433</a>，<a href="3434.htm">3434</a>，<a href="4482.htm">4482</a>节）。由此明显可知，“散开、从远而来的马兵”表示属于败坏的理解力的事物，因而表示虚假。</p>

And horsemen. That this signifies intellectual things, is evident from the signification of "horsemen," as being things that belong to the intellect, for by a "horse" is signified the intellectual (see 
n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321, 6125). That "horsemen" denote things that belong to the intellect or understanding, may be seen further from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah alone did lead him; He made 
him ride upon the high places of the earth (Deut. 32:12, 13);  speaking of the Ancient Church; "to make him ride upon the high places of the earth" denotes to endow with higher understanding. [2] 
In David: </p>
<p>     In thine honor mount up, and ride upon the Word of truth, and of gentleness, and of righteousness, and thy right hand shall teach thee wonderful things (Ps. 45:4), speaking of the Lord; 
"riding upon the Word of truth" denotes being in the very understanding of truth. Again: </p>
<p>     Sing to God, praise ye His name; extol Him that rideth upon the clouds by His name Jah (Ps. 68:4); </p>
<p> this 
also is said of the Lord; the "clouds" denote the literal sense of the Word (see the preface to Gen. 18, n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343e); "to ride upon them" is to be in the internal sense, where truth 
is in its intelligence and wisdom. [3] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     In that day I will smite every horse with amazement, and his rider with madness, and I will open Mine eye upon the house of Judah; but 
will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness (Zech. 12:4); </p>
<p>where "horse" denotes the intellectual; and "rider," the intellect. Who does not see that "horse" here does not mean horse, nor "rider" 
rider; but that something is signified which can be smitten with amazement and madness, also with blindness? That this pertains to the understanding is obvious. [4] That by "horses" and "horsemen" 
are signified intellectual things, and in the opposite sense reasonings and falsities thence derived, may be seen in John: </p>
<p>     I saw and behold a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow, and 
there was given unto him a crown, and he went forth conquering. And there went forth another horse that was red, and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they 
should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great sword. I saw and behold a black horse, and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. And I saw and behold a pale horse, and him that 
sat upon it, whose name was Death (Rev. 6:2-8); </p>
<p>that here the "horses" and "they that sat upon them" signify such things as belong to the understanding of truth, and in the opposite sense such things 
as belong to falsity, is evident from all the details. The "white horse and he that sat thereon" denotes the understanding of truth from the Word. That "he who sat upon the white horse" is the Lord as 
to the Word, is said in plain words (Rev. 19:11, 13, 16). The "red horse and he that sat thereon" denotes reasonings from the cupidities of evil, whereby violence is done to truths from the Word; the 
"black horse and he that sat thereon" denotes the intellectual of truth extinguished; and the "pale horse and he that sat upon it" denotes the consequent damnation. [5] In the opposite sense "horses" 
and "horsemen" denote the intellect perverted; and the consequent falsities, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Oholah committed whoredom under Me, and she doted on her lovers, governors and leaders, all of them 
desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. Her sister Oholibah loved the sons of Asshur, governors and leaders, her neighbors, clothed in perfect attire, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them 
desirable young men (Ezek. 23:5, 6, 12); </p>
<p>"Oholah" denotes the perverted spiritual church, which is "Samaria;" and "Oholibah" the perverted celestial church, which is "Jerusalem;" for the Israelites 
who were of Samaria represented the spiritual church, but the Jews who were of Jerusalem represented the celestial church. The "Assyrians" and "sons of Asshur" denote reasoning against the truths of 
faith (n. 1186); "horsemen riding on horses" denotes the understanding perverted, whence come falsities. [6] And in Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     I stir up the Chaldeans, a bitter and hasty nation, that goeth into 
the breadth of the earth, to inherit habitations not their own; their horses are swifter than leopards, and are sharper than the evening wolves, that their horsemen may spread themselves, whence their 
horsemen come from far (Hab. 1:6, 8);  the "Chaldeans" denote those who are in falsities, but in externals appear to be in truths, thus the profanation of truth, and "Babylon" the profanation of good 
(n. 1182, 1368). "Going into the breadth of the earth" denotes to destroy truths. (That the "breadth of the earth" is truth may be seen above, n. 3433, 3434, 4482.) Hence it is evident that the "horsemen 
who spread themselves and come from far" denotes the things that belong to perverted understanding, thus falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6534</b></p><p><b>6534.</b>
'And horsemen' means intellectual concepts. This is clear from the meaning of 'horsemen' as things connected with the understanding; for 'a horse' means the power of understanding, <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="6125.htm">6125</a>. The meaning of 'horsemen' as things connected with the understanding becomes clear in addition from the following places: In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah alone led him; He caused him to ride over the 
heights of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:12,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:12, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Ancient Church. 'Causing to ride over the heights of the land' stands for endowing with superior understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
In your 
majesty<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> climb into [your chariot], and ride on the word of truth and meekness and righteousness, and your right arm will teach you marvellous things. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2045:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 45:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. 'Riding on 
the word of truth' stands for having a genuine understanding of truth. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Sing to God, praise His name; exalt Him who rides on the clouds by His name Jah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers 
to the Lord. 'The clouds' stands for the literal sense of the Word, preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a> (end); 'riding on them' stands for being in command of the internal sense, in 
which truth resides with all the intelligence and wisdom it can bring. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness; and on the house of Judah 
I will open My eye. But every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Horse' stands for the power of understanding, and 'rider' or 'horseman' for the intellect. Does anyone 
not see that 'horse' here does not mean a horse, or that 'rider' does not mean rider, but that something else such as can be struck with panic and madness, and also with blindness, is meant? That something 
else, it is evident, is the understanding or intellect. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 By 'horses and horsemen' intellectual concepts are meant, and in the contrary sense reasonings and consequent falsities, as may be 
seen in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; to him a crown was given; he went out conquering. Then there came out another horse, fiery-red; and it was granted to 
him who sat on it that he should take peace away from the earth, and that men should slay one another. Therefore to him was given a great sword. I saw, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it 
held a balance in his hand. I saw therefore, and behold, a pale horse and he who sat on it, whose name was death. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:2,%204,%205,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:2, 4, 5, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here, as is evident from the details of the description, the horses 
and those seated on them mean things connected with an understanding consisting of truth, and in the contrary sense an understanding consisting of falsity. 'The white horse and he who sat on it' 
stands for an understanding consisting of truth gained from the Word; the one seated on the white horse is, as explicitly stated in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:11,%2013,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:11, 13, 16</a>, the Lord as to the Word. 'The fiery-red horse and 
he who sat on it' stands for reasonings resulting from desires for evil, which do violence to truths from the Word. 'The black horse and he who sat on it' stands for a destroyed ability to understand 
the truth, while 'the pale horse and he who sat on it' stands for damnation resulting from such destruction. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'Horses and horsemen' in the contrary sense stands for a perverted understanding 
and the falsities it produces, in Ezekiel also, </p>
<p>Oholah committed whoredom under Me and doted on her lovers - governors and leaders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. Her sister 
Oholibah was in love with the sons of Asshur - governors and leaders, her neighbours, clothed in perfect adornment, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:5,%206,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23:5, 6, 12</a>. </p>
<p>'Oholah' 
stands for the perverted spiritual Church, which is Samaria, and 'Oholibah' for the perverted celestial Church, which is Jerusalem; for the Israelites who belonged to Samaria represented 
the spiritual Church, but the Jews who belonged to Jerusalem represented the celestial Church. 'The Assyrians' and 'the sons of Asshur' stand for reasoning against the truths of faith, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>,'horsemen 
riding on horses' for a perverted understanding, from which falsities are produced. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Habakkuk, </p>
<p>I am rousing the Chaldeans, a bitter and headstrong nation, marching into the breadth of the 
earth, to inherit habitations that are not its own Its horses are swifter than leopards, sharper than the evening wolves, so that its horsemen spread out, and therefore its horsemen come from afar. Hab. 
1:6, <a href="8.htm">8</a>. </p>
<p>'The Chaldeans' stands for those governed by falsities, though to outward appearances they are governed by truths; thus 'the Chaldeans' stands for the profanation of truth, whereas 'Babel' 
stands for the profanation of good, <a href="1182.htm">1182</a>, <a href="1368.htm">1368</a>. 'Marching into the breadth of the earth' stands for destroying truths - 'the breadth of the earth' meaning truth, see <a href="3433.htm">3433</a>, <a href="3434.htm">3434</a>, <a href="4482.htm">4482</a>. From this it 
is evident that 'the horsemen who spread out and who arrive from afar' are things connected with a perverted understanding, which are therefore falsities.
