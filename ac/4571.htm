<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4571节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4571.</strong>“神又对他说”表出于神性的觉知。这从“说”在圣言历史中的含义清楚可知，“说”是指发觉（参看<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="1819.htm">1819</a>，<a href="1822.htm">1822</a>，<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2080.htm">2080</a>，<a href="2619.htm">2619</a>，<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>，<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>，<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>节）。“神说”表示神性是觉知的源头，因为神性自主成孕时就存在于祂里面。自主从耶和华成孕时，神性就是祂的实际存在。因此，祂的觉知来自神性，但觉知的程度取决于祂的人身接受的程度，因为祂是按着连续阶段将自己里面的人身变成神性的。由此明显可知，由于神性或神在祂里面，故“神对他说”这句话表示出于神性的觉知。</p>

And God said to him. That this signifies perception from the Divine, is evident from the signification in the historicals of the Word of "to say" as being to perceive (see n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 
1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509). That it was from the Divine is signified by "God said;" for the Divine was in the Lord from conception. This was His being, for He was conceived from Jehovah, 
and therefore His perception was from the Divine, but it was according to the state of the reception by His Human, because He made the Human in Himself Divine by successive steps. Hence it is evident 
that as the Divine or God was in Him, by the words "God said to him" is signified perception from the Divine. </p>

'And God said to him' means perception from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'laying' in the historical narratives of the Word as perceiving, dealt with in <a href="1791.htm">1791</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="1819.htm">1819</a>, <a href="1822.htm">1822</a>, <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2080.htm">2080</a>, <a href="2619.htm">2619</a>, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>, <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>, <a href="3509.htm">3509</a>. The Divine as the source of that perception is meant by the words 'God said', for the Divine was present within the Lord from conception; the Divine was His actual 
Being (Esse) since He had been conceived from Jehovah. His perception therefore was from the Divine, but the degree of perception depended on the state of reception by the Human; for He made the Human 
within Himself Divine in successive stages. From this it is evident that because the Divine or God was within Him, 'God said to him' means perception from the Divine. </p>

`Et dixit illi Deus': quod significet perceptionem a Divino, constat a significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi, quod {3} sit percipere, de qua n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 
2862, 3395, 3509; quod a Divino, significatur per quod `Deus dixit,' in Domini enim a conceptione Divinum fuit, hoc fuit Ipsius Esse, nam a Jehovah conceptus erat; inde perceptio Ipsius a Divino fuit, 
sed secundum statum receptionis ab Humano, quia {2} Humanum in {3} Se successive Divinum fecit; inde patet quia Divinum seu Deus in Ipso, quod per `dixit illi Deus' significetur perceptio a Divino.
