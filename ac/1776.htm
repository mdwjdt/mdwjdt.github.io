<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1776节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1776.</strong>当小男孩和小女孩阅读圣言时，天使对它的理解甚至比没有仁之信的成年人阅读时更好、更充分。这似乎是一个悖论，但却是最真实不过的。我也获悉其中的缘由，即：小男孩和小女孩处于相爱和纯真的状态，因而他们最温柔的器皿几乎是属天的，具有简单的接受能被主预备好接受之物的能力。然而，主所做的这一切若非经由适合其性情天赋的某种快乐，不会进入他们的知觉。据天使说，主的圣言是死的文字，但在阅读它的每个人里面，主都会照着各人接受它的能力而赋予它生命，它会根据其仁爱的生命和纯真的状态而复活。这种情形以无数种方式发生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1776.</strong> It may seem perplexing — although it is absolutely true — that angels understand the Word's inner meaning better and more fully when young girls and boys read it than when adults who lack a faith born of neighborly love do. The reason I was given is that young boys and girls are at a stage of innocence and mutual love. So the vessels [of their minds] are very tender, almost heavenly, completely open to outside influences, and therefore capable of being molded by the Lord. (They are unaware of his molding, however, except perhaps through a kind of delight perfectly suited to their tastes.)<br />The Lord's Word, the angels said, is dead verbiage, but he brings it alive in the person who reads it. He gives it as much life as each of us is capable of receiving, and the more charity we express in our lives and the more innocent we are, the more living the Word becomes. This happens in countless different ways. </p>

It may seem a paradox, but still it is most true, that the angels understand the internal sense of the Word better and more fully when little boys and girls are reading it, than when it is read by adult 
persons who are not in the faith of charity. The cause has been told me, and is that little boys and girls are in a state of mutual love and innocence, and thus their most tender vessels are almost 
heavenly, and are simply capacities for receiving, which therefore can be disposed by the Lord; although this does not come to their perception, except by a certain delight suited to their genius. It 
was said by the angels that the Word of the Lord is a dead letter; but that in him that reads it is vivified by the Lord according to the capacity of each one; and that it becomes living according to 
the life of his charity and his state of innocence, and this with inexpressible variety. </p>

Though it may seem paradoxical it is nevertheless perfectly true that angels have a better and fuller understanding of the internal sense of the Word when very young boys and girls are reading it than 
when adults do so with whom there is no faith grounded in charity. I have been told the reason why, and it is this: Very young boys and girls live in a state of mutual love and innocence, and so their 
most tender vessels are almost heavenly, being simply capacities for receiving which are able to be made ready by the Lord to receive. No awareness however of what He is doing enters into their perceptions 
except through a certain delight in keeping with their character and disposition. The angels said that the Word of the Lord is a dead letter, but that in everyone, when he is reading it, it is 
given life by the Lord, each according to his capacity to receive it, and that it is made alive according to the life in his charity and according to his state of innocence. This happens in countless 
and varied ways. </p>

</p><b>1776.</b>
Paradoxon potest videri sed usque est verissimum, quod angeli melius et plenius intelligant sensum internum Verbi, cum infantes pueri et puellae legunt illud, quam cum adulti qui non in fide charitatis; 
causa mihi dicta, quia infantes pueri et puellae sunt in statu amoris mutui et innocentiae, ita vasa illorum tenerrima paene caelestia, et modo facultates recipiendi, quae ita a Domino disponi queunt; 
tametsi hoc ad illorum perceptionem non perveniat, nisi per jucundum quoddam illorum geniis conforme.  Ab angelis dictum quod Verbum Domini sit littera mortua, sed quod in legente vivificetur a 
Domino secundum cujusvis facultatem; et quod vivum fiat secundum ejus charitatis vitam et innocentiae statum, et hoc cum innumerabili varietate. </p>
