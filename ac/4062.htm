<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />4062.创世记31:1-3.雅各听见拉班的儿子们有话说，雅各把我们父亲所有的都夺了去，并借着我们父亲的，得了这一切的财富。雅各见拉班的脸色，看哪，向他不如从前了。耶和华对雅各说，你要回你祖之地，到你的出生地那里去，我必与你同在。<br />“雅各听见拉班的儿子们有话说”表属于“拉班”所表良善的真理，相对于主由此在属世层中所获得的良善而言，是何性质。“雅各把我们父亲所有的都夺了去”表现在“雅各”所表良善的一切已经从那源头被赋予祂。“并借着我们父亲的，得了这一切的财富”表主将它赋予自己。“雅各见拉班的脸色”表当“雅各”所表良善离开时，那良善所具有的状态的改变。“看哪，向他不如从前了”表对“雅各”所表良善的状态完全改变了；然而没有任何东西从那良善那里被夺走，除了与居间良善结合外，它所拥有的是它以前就拥有的。“耶和华对雅各说”表主出于神性的觉察。“你要回你祖之地”表祂现在要使自己更接近神性良善。“到你的出生地那里去”表祂要使自己去往源于那良善的真理。“我必与你同在”表在这种情况下，它将是神性。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-3. And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken all that was our father's; and from that which was our father's hath he made all this abundance. And 
Jacob saw the faces of Laban, and behold he was not at all with him as yesterday and the day before. And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy nativity, and I will be 
with thee. "And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying," signifies the truths of the good signified by "Laban," of what quality they were relatively to the good acquired thereby by the Lord in the 
natural; "Jacob hath taken all that was our father's," signifies that all things of the good now meant by "Jacob" had been given Him therefrom; "and from that which was our father's hath he made all 
this abundance," signifies that He gave it to Himself; "and Jacob saw the faces of Laban," signifies a change of state with that good, when the good meant by "Jacob" receded; "and behold he was not 
at all with him as yesterday and the day before," signifies the state altogether changed toward the good signified by "Jacob," although nothing was taken away from it, but that it had its own as before, 
except the state in respect to conjunction; "and Jehovah said unto Jacob," signifies the Lord's perception from the Divine; "return unto the land of thy fathers," signifies that He should now betake 
Himself nearer to good Divine; " and to thy nativity," signifies that He should betake Himself to the derivative truth; "and I will be with thee," signifies that it would then be Divine. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-3 And he<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken all that belonged to our father, and from what belonged to our father he has gained all this wealth. 
And Jacob saw Laban's face, and behold, he was not at all friendly towards him as before.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to [the place of] your nativity, and I will 
be with you. </p>
<p>'He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying' means the nature of the truths belonging to the good meant by 'Laban' in comparison with the good thereby acquired in the Natural by the 
Lord. 'Jacob has taken all that belonged to our father' means that every aspect of good now meant by 'Jacob' had been given to Him from that source. 'And from what belonged to our father he has gained 
all this wealth' means that He gave it to Himself. 'And Jacob saw Laban's face' means a change of state with that good when the good meant by Jacob was departing from it. 'And behold, he was not at 
all friendly towards him as before' means that towards the good meant by 'Jacob' the state was completely altered; yet nothing had been taken away from that good, for it possessed what was its own as 
it had done previously, apart from its link with [the intermediate good]. 'And Jehovah said to Jacob' means the Lord's perception from the Divine. 'Return to the land of your fathers' means that He had 
now to bring Himself closer to Divine good. 'And to [the place of] your nativity' means towards the truth deriving from that good. 'And I will be with you' means that in that case it will be Divine.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-3.  Et audivit verba filiorum Labanis, dicendo, Sumpsit Jacob omnia quae patri nostro, et a quibus patri nostro, fecit omnem copiam hanc.  Et vidit 
Jacob facies Labanis, et ecce nullatenus is cum eo sicut heri nudius tertius.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Jacobum, Revertere ad terram patrum tuorum, et ad nativitatem tuam, et ero cum te.  Audivit verba 
filiorum Labanis, dicendo' significat boni per Labanem significati vera qualia respective ad bonum acquisitum inde in Naturali a Domino: `Sumpsit Jacob omnia quae patri nostro' significat quod omnia 
boni per Jacobum nunc intellecti data ipsi sint inde: `et a quibus patri nostro, fecit omnem copiam hanc' significat quod Ipse Sibi daret: `et vidit Jacob facies Labanis' significat status mutationem 
apud bonum illud cum recederet bonum per `Jacob' intellectum: `et ecce nullatenus is cum eo sicut heri nudius tertius' significat statum prorsus mutatum erga bonum per `Jacob' significatum, a 
quo tamen nihil desumptum quin haberet sua sicut prius, praeter statum quoad conjunctionem: </p>
<p>`et dixit Jehovah ad Jacobum' significat Domini perceptionem ex Divino: `Revertere ad terram patrum tuorum 
significat quod nunc propius se conferret ad bonum Divinum: `et ad nativitatem tuam' significat quod ad verum inde: `et ero tecum significat quod tunc Divinum. </p>
