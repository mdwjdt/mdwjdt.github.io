<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2351节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2351.</strong>“呼叫罗得，对他说”表源于邪恶的虚假向良善发怒。这从“呼叫”和“罗得”的含义，并由此从所表达的感觉清楚可知：“呼叫”（crying）这个词论及虚假，如前所示（<a href="2240.htm">2240</a>节）；“罗得”代表具有良善的教会成员，因而代表良善本身（<a href="2324.htm">2324</a>节）。由此，并由这些话所表达的愤怒的感觉明显可知，它们表源于邪恶的虚假向良善发怒。虚假有很多种类，但一般有两种，即由邪恶所产生的虚假和产生邪恶的虚假（参看<a href="1188.htm">1188</a>，<a href="1212.htm">1212</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1679.htm">1679</a>，<a href="2243.htm">2243</a>节）。<br />在教会中，出于邪恶的虚假尤指支持邪恶生活的虚假。如以下虚假：使人成为教会成员的不是良善，即仁爱，而是真理，即信仰；无论人一生过着什么样的邪恶生活，只要当肉体的情欲归于沉寂后，如临终之时，他能以诚挚的情感作出某种信仰告白，他就能得救。这就是尤其向良善发怒的虚假，由“呼叫罗得”来表示。发怒的起因就是努力摧毁爱之快乐的一切。当邪恶攻击良善时，它被称为“发怒”；而当良善责备邪恶时，它就被称为“热情”。</p>

They cried unto Lot and said unto him. That this signifies falsity from evil becoming angry against good, can be seen from the signification of "crying," and also of "Lot," and thereby from the feeling 
that is expressed. That the term "crying" is predicated of falsity, was shown above (n. 2240); and that "Lot" represents the men of the church who are in good, thus good itself (n. 2324). From this 
and from the feeling of anger expressed in these words, it is evident that they signify falsity from evil becoming angry against good. That there are many kinds of falsity, but in general two, namely, 
the falsity which is produced from evil, and that which produces evil, may be seen above (n. 1188, 1212, 1295, 1679, 2243). [2] The falsity from evil, within the church, is especially that falsity 
which favors evils of life-such as that good, that is, charity, does not make a man of the church, but truth, that is, faith; and that a man is saved howsoever he may have lived in evils during the whole 
course of his life, provided that when corporeal things are lulled to sleep, as is usual a short time before death, he utters something of faith with apparent affection. This is the falsity which 
is especially angry against good, and is signified by their "crying to Lot." The cause of anger is all that which endeavors to destroy the delight of any love. It is called "anger" when evil attacks good, 
but "zeal" when good reproves evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2351</b></p><p><b>2351.</b>
'They cried out to Lot, and said to him' means anger directed against good on the part of falsity deriving from evil. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'crying out', also of 'Lot', and so from the 
feeling that is being expressed. The expression 'cry out' has reference to what is false, as shown in <a href="2240.htm">2240</a>, while 'Lot' represents members of the Church with whom good exists, and so represents good 
itself, <a href="2324.htm">2324</a>. From this meaning of 'cry out' and this representation of 'Lot', and from the feeling of anger which these words hold within them, it is clear that anger directed against good on the part 
of falsity deriving from evil is meant. There are many kinds of falsity, but they all fall into two general categories - either into falsity which is a product of evil, or into falsity which is a 
producer of evil, see <a href="1188.htm">1188</a>, <a href="1212.htm">1212</a>, <a href="1295.htm">1295</a>, <a href="1679.htm">1679</a>, <a href="2243.htm">2243</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Falsity from evil, within the Church, is in particular that falsity which looks favourably on evils of life, such as the falsity that good, or 
charity, does not make anyone a member of the Church, but truth, or faith; and that a person is saved, no matter whether throughout the whole course of his life he has led a life of evil deeds, provided 
that when the desires and sensations of the body decline - as usually happens shortly before death - he utters some profession of faith with apparent affection. This is the falsity which in particular 
has its anger directed against good and which is meant by the words 'they cried out to Lot'. The cause of anger exists in everything that endeavours to destroy the delight that belongs to any love. 
It is termed 'anger' when evil attacks good, but 'zeal' when good reproves evil. </p>

</p><b>2351.</b>
`Clamaverunt ad Lot, et dixerunt ei': quod significet falsum ex malo irascens contra bonum, constare potest (c)ex significatione `clamare,' tum `Loti,' et sic ab affectu; quod vox `clamare' praedicetur 
de falso, n. 2240 ostensum est; quod `Lot' repraesentet homine' Ecclesiae qui in bono, ita ipsum bonum, n. 2324; inde et ex affectu irae qui in his verbis, constat quod sit falsum ex malo irascens 
contra bonum.  Quod plura genera falsi sint, in genere {1} autem duo, nempe falsum quod producitur ex malo, et quod producit malum, videatur n. 1188, 1212, 1295, 1679, 2243; [2] falsum ex malo quod intra 
Ecclesiam, imprimis est falsum quod favet malis vitae, ut est illud quod bonum: hoc est, charitas, non faciat hominem Ecclesiae, sed verum, hoc est: fides; et quod salvetur homo utcumque per omnem 
vitae suae cursum in malis vixerit, modo in statu sopitionis corporeorum, ut solet fieri brevi ante mortem, aliquid fidei cum apparente affectione enuntiaverit: hoc falsum est quod imprimis irascitur 
contra bonum, et significatur per quod `clamaverint ad Lot.' `Causa irae est omne id quod destruere conatur jucundum alicujus amoris; `ira' vocatur quando malum impugnat bonum, `zelus' autem quando 
bonum increpat malum. 	@1 A has imprimis with in genere written above it, neither is deleted.$ </p>
