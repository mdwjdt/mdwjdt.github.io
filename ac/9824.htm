<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9824节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9824.</strong>“以弗得”表那里外在形式上的神性真理，内层事物就终止于其中。这从“以弗得”的含义清楚可知，“以弗得”是指外在形式上的神性真理。“以弗得”之所以具有这种含义，是因为亚伦的圣衣代表属灵国度里在其适当次序中的神性真理（参看<a href="9522.htm">9522</a>节）；“以弗得”是这三样衣服的最外层；亚伦供祭司职分的衣服是以弗得、外袍和杂色内袍。最外在的事物不仅包含内层事物，而且内层事物还终止于其中。人体，因而众天堂也是这种情况，因为人体的各个方面都对应于众天堂。这同样适用于真理和良善，因为它们构成众天堂。<br />由于以弗得代表主的属灵国度最外在的部分，所以它比其余的衣服更神圣，它上面是含有乌陵和土明的胸牌，来自神性的答复通过乌陵和土明给出。最外在的部分之所以比内在事物更神圣，是因为最外在的事物包含在其适当次序中的一切内层事物。它以一种如此完美的外在形式和关联包含它们，以致如果最外在的事物被拿走，内在事物就会分崩离析；因为内在事物不仅终止于最外在的事物，还一起存在于那里。这一事实是能被那些知道连续事物和同步事物是怎么回事的人认识到的；也就是说，按其适当次序行进并彼此跟随的连续事物仍一起存在于最后和最低层。以目的、原因和结果为例。在次序上目的是第一位的，原因是第二位的，结果是最后和最低的；因此，它们也一个接一个发展、行进。然而，原因同时显现在最后的结果里面；目的则如此显现在原因里面。所以结果是内层或在先事物的完成，内层或在先事物汇集在一起，并寄住在结果里面。<br />人的意愿、思维和行为也是这种情况。意愿首先到来，思维其次，行为最后。行为也是结果，结果则拥有共存于它里面的两种在先或内层事物。因为行为在何等程度上包含此人的所思所愿，内层事物就在何等程度上包含在一种形式和关联中。这解释了为何圣言说，人照自己的行为或作为受审判，这意味着他将照他的思维和意愿受审判，因为这些就存在于他的行为里面，如同灵魂存在于它的身体里面。由于内层事物共存于最后和最低之物里面，故可知，如前所述，如果次序是完美的，那么最后和最低之物就视为比内层事物更神圣，因为内层事物的神圣完整或完全地存在于它里面。<br />由于内层事物共存于最后和最低事物中，就像刚才所举的例子一样，即人的思维和意愿（或其属灵层面上的信和爱）共存于他的行为或作为里面，所以主爱约翰胜过其余的门徒，约翰也挨近祂怀里（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.23.htm">13:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.20.htm">21:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.22.htm">22</a>）。这是因为这个门徒代表仁爱的行为（参看创世记18和22章序言，以及<a href="3934.htm">3934</a>节）。由此也明显可知为何在一个完美次序中的最外在或最后之物比与它分离的单独的内在事物更神圣。因为当主存在于最后和最低之物里面时，祂同时存在于一切事物里面；当祂存在于最后和最低之物里面时，内层事物就一起被保持在其适当次序、关联和形式中，照主的美意而在祂的掌控和指引之下。这就是9360节所说的奥秘，如你所看到的。<br />这就是以弗得因是主的属灵国度最后和最低的部分而被视为比属祭司职分的其它衣服更为神圣的原因。因此，以弗得是大祭司的祭服，由金线在蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色和捻的细麻布中间织成（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.3.htm">39:3</a>）；但其余的祭司则穿着细麻布的以弗得（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.18.htm">2:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上22.18.htm">22:18</a>）。这解释了为何“以弗得”表示一个祭司的全部祭服，又为何经上说他“穿着以弗得”，以此表示他是一个祭司（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.28.htm">2:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上14.3.htm">14:3</a>）。这也解释了为何胸牌系在以弗得上，又为何通过上面的乌陵和土明给出答复。也就是说，这件祭服是主的属灵国度最低部分的一个代表；从神来的答复就呈现在最后和最低的事物中；事实上，它们经过了一个接一个的一切内层事物，在最后和最低事物中将自己表明出来，因为它们在那里终止。当祭司穿上以弗得时，答复就会给出，这一点从撒母耳记上（<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上23.6.htm">23:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上23.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上30.7.htm">30:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上30.8.htm">8</a>）明显看出来，也可见于何西阿书：<br />以色列人也必多日独居，无君王、无首领、无祭祀、无柱像、无以弗得、无家中的神像。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.4.htm">3:4</a>）<br />“家中的神像”表示来自神的答复，因为在过去，答复通过它们给出（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.2.htm">10:2</a>）。此外，在原文，“以弗得”一词源自“包裹一切内层事物”这一词根，这从这个词（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.5.htm">29:5</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.7.htm">8:7</a>）的含义明显看出来。</p>

And an ephod. That this signifies Divine truth in this kingdom in the external form in which interior things cease, is evident from the signification of "the ephod," as being Divine truth in an external 
form. The reason why this is signified by "the ephod" is that by Aaron's garments of holiness were represented Divine truths in the spiritual kingdom in their order (see above, n. 9522); and the ephod 
was the outermost of three garments; Aaron's garments for the priest's office being the ephod, the robe, and the checkered tunic. That which is outermost not only contains the interior things, but 
the interior things also cease in it. This is the case in the human body, and consequently also in the heavens, to which the things of the human body correspond. The case is similar with truths and 
goods, for these make the heavens.  [2] As the ephod represented the outermost of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, it was more holy than the rest of the garments, and on it was the breastplate, in which 
were the Urim and Thummim, through which answers were given by the Divine. That what is most external is more holy than the internal things, is because the external holds all the interior things in their 
order, and in their form and connection, insomuch that if the external were removed, the internal things would be dispersed; for internal things not only cease in the external, but they are also 
together in it. That this is so can be known to those who know how it is with things successive and things simultaneous; namely, that successive things, which proceed and follow one another in their order, 
are nevertheless presented together in the ultimate things. Take for example, end, cause, and effect; the end is the first in order, the cause is the second, and the effect is the ultimate. So also 
do they advance in succession. Nevertheless the cause is presented simultaneously in the effect, which is the ultimate; and the end is so presented in the cause. Consequently the effect is the completion, 
in which the interior or prior things are collected together and are lodged. [3] The case is similar in man, with will, thought, and action. To will comes first, to think second, and to do is 
the ultimate, and this is also the effect in which the prior or interior things come forth in simultaneous order. For insofar as the act contains within itself that which the man is thinking, and that 
which he is willing, so far the interior things are held together in their form and in their connection. It is from this that it is said in the Word, that man will be judged according to his deeds, 
or according to his works, which means that he will be judged according to his thought and will, for these are in his deeds as the soul is in his body. As then the interior things are presented simultaneously 
in the ultimate, it follows that, as already said, if the order is perfect, the ultimate is accounted more holy than the interior things, for therein is complete the holiness of the interior 
things.  [4] As the interior things are together in the ultimate ones (as for instance, as just said, man's thought and will are together in his deeds or works; or in regard to spiritual things, his 
faith and love are so), therefore John was beloved by the Lord more than the rest of the disciples, and lay on His breast (John 13:23; 21:20, 22), for the reason that this disciple represented the works 
of charity. (See the prefaces to Genesis 18 and 22, and also n. 3934.) From this it is also evident why the external or ultimate which is in perfect order, is more holy than the internal things regarded 
singly; for when the Lord is in the ultimate, He is simultaneously in all things, and when He is in this, the interior things are held together in their order, connection, and form; and under super-vision 
and guidance at His good pleasure. This is the secret which is meant in n. 9360, which see. [5] This then is the reason why the ephod, being a representative of the ultimate in the Lord's 
spiritual kingdom, was accounted more holy than the rest of the garments of the priesthood. Wherefore the ephod was the chief priestly vestment, and was made of threads of gold in the midst of blue, 
of crimson, of scarlet double-dyed, and of fine twined linen (Exod. 39:3); but the rest of the priests had ephods of linen (1 Sam. 2:18; 22:18). On this account also the ephod stood for all the vestments 
of a priest, and he was said "to wear the ephod," whereby was signified that he was a priest (1 Sam. 2:28; 14:3). On this account also the breastplate was fastened to the ephod, and answers were given 
by means of the Urim and Thummim thereon, for the reason that this vestment was a representative of the ultimate in the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and Divine answers are presented in ultimates, for 
they pass through all the interior things in succession, and are there dictated, because there they cease. That answers were given when the priests were clothed with the ephod, is evident from 1 Samuel 
23:6-13; 30:7, 8; and also in Hosea: </p>
<p>     The sons of Israel tarried many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod, and teraphim (Hos. 3:4); </p>
<p>where 
"teraphim" signify Divine answers, for answers were formerly given by means of these (Zech. 10:2). Moreover, in the original tongue the word "ephod" comes from "to enclose all the interior 
things," as is evident from the meaning of the word in Exodus 29:5; Leviticus 8:7. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9824</b></p><p><b>9824.</b>
'And an ephod' means Divine Truth there in an outward form, in which inner things terminate. This is clear from the meaning of 'an ephod' as Divine Truth in an outward form. The reason why 'an ephod' 
has this meaning is that Aaron's holy garments represented forms of Divine Truth in the spiritual kingdom, in their proper order, see above in <a href="9822.htm">9822</a>, and the ephod was the outermost of the three garments, 
Aaron's holy garments being the ephod, the robe, and the checkered tunic. Not only does what is outermost contain inner things; but inner things also terminate in it. This applies to the human body, 
and therefore also applies to the heavens, to which aspects of the human body correspond. It applies similarly to truths and forms of good, for both these constitute the heavens.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the 
ephod represented the most external part of the Lord's spiritual kingdom it was holier than all the other garments; and on it there was the breastplate containing the Urim and Thummim, by means of which 
answers from the Divine were given. The reason why the most external part is holier than the things within is that what is outermost contains all inner things in their proper order. It contains them 
in an outward form and in a connection which are so perfect that if what is outermost were taken away the things within would disintegrate; for the things within not only terminate there, but also 
exist together there. The truth of this may be recognized by people who know about the nature of things that succeed one another and those that exist together with one another, namely that those which 
succeed one another, that is, proceed and follow one another in their proper order, also stand together with one another at the last and lowest levels. Let end, cause, and effect exemplify this. The 
end is the first in order, the cause is the second, and the effect is the last and lowest, so that these too progress one after another. Yet within the effect, which is last, the cause at the same time 
manifests itself, as does the end within the cause. Consequently the effect is the completion of the inner or prior things, which have also been brought together in it and lodge there.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The situation 
is similar with human will, thought, and action; will comes first, thought second, and action last. Action is also the effect that has the two prior or inner things existing together within it. 
For to the extent that action contains what the person thinks and what the person wills, inner things are contained in a form and in connection. This explains why the Word says that a person will be 
judged according to his deeds or works, which means that he will be judged according to his thought and will, for these are present within deeds as the soul is within its body. Now since inner things 
present themselves together in what is last and lowest, then if the order is perfect that which is last and lowest, as has been stated, is held to be holier than the inner things, because it is there 
that the holiness of the inner things exists in its fullness.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since inner things exist together in the last and lowest in the same way, as has been stated, as a person's thought and will - or, 
on a spiritual level, his faith and love - exist together in his deeds or works, John more than all the other disciples was loved by the Lord and leaned on His breast, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:23;%2021:20,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:23; 21:20, 22</a>. This was 
because that disciple represented the works of charity, see Prefaces to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a> and <a href="22.htm">22</a>, and also <a href="3934.htm">3934</a>. This too shows why what is outermost or last within perfect order is holier than the things 
within if considered separately from it. For when the Lord is present in what is last and lowest He is at the same time present on all levels; and when He is present in it inner things are contained 
in their proper order, connection, and form, and are under His control and guidance, subject to His good will. This is the arcanum that was meant in <a href="9360.htm">9360</a>, as you may see.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This then is the reason 
why the ephod, being representative of the last and lowest part of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, was held to be holier than the rest of the garments belonging to the priestly office. Therefore the 
ephod was the chief of the priestly vestments, being made from threads of gold in among the violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twined linen, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2039:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 39:3</a>, though the rest of the priests had ephods 
made of linen, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%202:18;%2022:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 2:18; 22:18</a>. This goes to explain why the word 'ephod' stood for a priest's whole attire and why he was said 'to wear the ephod', meaning that he was a priest, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%202:28;%2014:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 2:28; 14:3</a>. It also goes to explain why the breastplate was tied to the ephod and why answers were given through the Urim and Thummim there. That is to say, this vestment was a representative sign of the lowest 
part of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and answers from God present themselves in things last and lowest; for they pass through all the inner levels one after another, declaring themselves on the 
last and lowest because they terminate there. The fact that answers were given when they wore the ephod is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2023:6-13;%2030:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 23:6-13; 30:7, 8</a>, and also in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
The children of Israel sat many days 
with no king, and no prince, and no sacrifice, and no pillar, and no ephod, and no teraphim<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%203:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 3:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Teraphim' means answers from God, for in former times answers were given through them,

Furthermore the word 'ephod' in the original language is derived from the root 'to enclose all inner things', as is evident from the meaning of that word in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:5</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%208:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 8:7</a>.

`Et ephodum': quod significet Divinum Verum ibi in forma externa in quod desinunt interiora, constat ex significatione `ephodi' quod sit Divinum Verum in forma externa; quod id per `ephodum' significetur, 
est quia per vestes sanctitatis Aharonis repraesentabantur Divina Vera in regno spirituali in suo ordine, videatur supra n. (x)9822, et ephodum erat {1}extremum trium vestium, nam vestes {2}sanctitatis 
Aharonis {3}erant ephodum, pallium, et tunica tesselata; quod {1}extremum est, id non modo continet interiora, sed etiam interiora in illud desinunt; ita se habet in corpore humano, proinde etiam 
in caelis, quibus illa quae humani corporis sunt correspondent; similiter cum veris et bonis, nam haec et illa faciunt caelos. 	Quia ephodum repraesentabat maxime externum regni spiritualis 2 Domini, 
ideo erat id prae reliquis vestibus sanctum, et in eo pectorale, in quo Urim et Thumim, per quae responsa a Divino data sunt; quod maxime externum sit prae internis sanctum, est quia externum continet 
omnia interiora in suo ordine, inque forma et in nexu, usque adeo ut si removeretur externum, dissiparentur interna, {4}ibi enim interna non modo desinunt, sed etiam ibi simul sunt; quod ita sit, 
scire possunt illi qui sciunt quomodo se habet cum successivis et cum simultaneis, quod nempe successiva, quae procedunt et consequuntur in suo ordine, usque etiam in ultimis se simul sistant; sint 
pro exemplo finis, causa, et effectus: finis est primum in ordine, causa est secundum, et effectus est ultimum; ita quoque successive progrediuntur, at usque in effectu, {5}qui ultimum est, sistitur 
causa simul, ac finis in causa; inde est effectus complementum, in quo {6}interiora seu priora etiam collata sunt et hospitantur. 	3 Similiter se habet cum velle, cogitare, et facere apud hominem; velle 
est primum, cogitare est alterum, et facere est ultimum, quod etiam est effectus, in quo priora seu interiora simul existunt, nam quantum facere in se continet id quod homo cogitat, et quod vult, 
tantum {7}in forma et in nexu continentur interiora; inde est quod {8}in Verbo dicatur quod homo judicandus sit secundum facta sua seu secundum opera, quod significat quod judicandus secundum cogitare 
et velle suum, nam haec in factis sunt sicut anima in suo corpore. Quia nunc interiora in ultimo (t)se simul sistunt, ideo, ut dictum est, ultimum, si perfectus ordo {9}, pro sancto habetur prae interioribus 
{10}, est enim ibi sanctitas interiorum completa. 	4 (s)Quia in ultimis interiora simul sunt, sicut, ut dictum,in factis seu operibus cogitare et velle hominis, seu in spiritualibus, fides et 
amor {11}ejus, ideo Johannes prae reliquis discipulis amatus fuit a Domino et jacuit ad pectus Ipsius, Joh. xiii 23, xxi 20, 22; ex causa quia ille discipulus repraesentabat opera charitatis, videatur 
Praefatio ad Gen. xviii et ad xxii, tum n. 3934; inde quoque patet cur externum seu ultimum, quod in perfecto ordine est, sanctum sit prae internis singillatim spectatis; est enim Dominus, cum in ultimo, 
simul in omnibus, et cum in illo est, interiora continentur in suo ordine, nexu, et forma, inque auspicio et ductu ad beneplacitum; hoc arcanum est quod intellectum est n. 9360, quod videatur. 	5 
Haec nunc causa est quod ephodum, quia repraesentativum ultimi {12}regni spiritualis Domini erat, sanctius habitum fuerit quam reliquae vestes {13}sacerdotii; quapropter ephodum principalis amictus 
sacerdotalis fuit, {14}et factum erat ex filis auri in medio hyacinthini, purpurae, coccinei dibaphi, et byssini contexti, Exod. xxxix 3, at reliquis sacerdotibus erant ephoda ex lino, 1 Sam. ii 18, 
xxii 18; {15}et ideo ephodum sumebatur pro omni amictu sacerdotis, et dicebatur portare ephodum, quo significabatur quod esset sacerdos, 1 Sam. ii 28, xiv 3; ideo etiam pectorale alligatum ephodo fuit, 
et per Urim et Thumim ibi responsa dabantur, ex causa quia is amictus repraesentativum ultimi in regno spirituali Domini {16}erat, et responsa Divina sistuntur in ultimis, transeunt enim per omnia 
interiora successive, ac ibi dictantur, quia ibi desinunt; quod responsa darentur cum induti ephodo, constat ex 1 Sam. xxiii 6-13 et xxx 7, 8; et quoque apud Hoscheam, 	Dies multos sedebant filii Israelis, 
non rex et non princeps, et non sacrificium et non statua, et non ephodum et (x)teraphim, (x)iii 4; </p>
