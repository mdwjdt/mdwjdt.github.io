<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3891节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3891.</strong>不仅整个天堂如一个人那样呼吸，而且一切个体社群也联合呼吸，甚至所有天使和灵人也是如此。这一事实已通过众多活生生的经历向我证明了，以至于让我在这个问题上丝毫没有怀疑的余地。灵人惊讶万分，居然有人对此有所怀疑。除了天使和灵人是非物质的观念外，很少有人对他们持有其它观念。在这种情况下，他们只会是思维，几乎不是真正的实质，更不会享有世人那样的视觉、听觉和触觉，尤其不会有呼吸，因而没有像世人那样的生命。然而，他们的生命更为内在，就像灵的生命之于人的生命那样。有鉴于此，我在此再引用一些经历。<br />有一次，临睡前我被告知，有许多人密谋对付我，想让我窒息而死。不过，我没有理会他们的威胁，因为主保护我，于是我安然入睡。但到了半夜，我醒了，分明感觉我不是凭自己在呼吸，而是通过天堂在呼吸。因为呼吸的动作不是我自己的，而我自己仍然在呼吸。在许多其它场合，我得以感觉到灵人，以及天使的呼吸，因为他们在我里面呼吸；但当时我自己的呼吸仍在，与他们的不同。没有人能感觉到这一点，除非他的内层被打开，并以这种方式被引入与天堂的联系。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3891</b></p><p><b>3891.</b>
That not only does the universal heaven respire as one man, but also each of the societies in company, nay all angels and spirits, has been testified to me by very many living experiences, so as to leave 
me in no doubt on the subject. Spirits are surprised that anyone should have any doubt concerning the matter; but as there are few who have any other idea of angels and spirits than as of that which 
is immaterial, whence they would be mere thoughts, and thus scarcely substances, still less would as men enjoy the senses of seeing, hearing, and of touch, and still less would have respiration, and 
thus a life like man's (although of an interior kind, such as is the life of a spirit relatively to that of a man); therefore I may here adduce yet further experiences. Before falling asleep I was 
once told beforehand that there were some who were conspiring against me with the intent to kill me by suffocation; but I paid no attention to their threats, because I was protected by the Lord, and therefore 
I fell asleep without apprehension. But on awaking at midnight I was made very sensible that I did not respire from myself, but from heaven; for the respiration was not my own, and yet I respired. 
On many other occasions it has been given me to be sensible of the breathing or respiration of spirits, and also of angels, from the fact that they respired within me; and that my own respiration 
was nevertheless at the same time present, distinct from theirs. But no one can be sensible of this unless his interiors are opened, and he is thus brought into communication with heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3891</b></p><p><b>3891.</b>
The fact that not only the whole of heaven breathes as one human being but also that all the individual communities breathe unitedly, indeed that all angels and spirits do so, has been proved to me by 
very many living experiences, so that I was not left in any doubt about it. Indeed spirits are amazed that anyone should be in any doubt about it. But because few have any other idea about angels and 
spirits than the idea of their being non-material (in which case they would be mere thoughts and so scarcely real substances) still less any idea about their enjoying the senses of sight, hearing, and 
touch as men do, and least of all any idea about angels and spirits breathing and therefore possessing life similar to man's (though a more interior life, as a spirit's life is in contrast to man's) 
let further experiences be introduced. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 On one occasion I was told before going to sleep that many were plotting against me who had it in mind to make me perish by suffocation. But I took no notice 
of their threats because the Lord protected me, and so I went comfortably off to sleep. But at midnight I woke up and plainly experienced that I was not breathing from myself but was doing so from 
heaven. For the act of breathing was not my own and yet I myself was still breathing. On countless other occasions I have been allowed to feel what the breathing of spirits and also of angels is like 
through the experience of them breathing within me, though my own breathing continued at the same time yet separately from theirs. But nobody is allowed to have such an experience unless the interior 
parts of him have been opened and communication with heaven granted to him in this way. </p>

</p><b>3891.</b>
Quod non modo universum caelum sicut unus homo respiret, sed etiam singulae societates in consortio, immo quod omnes angeli et spiritui testatum mihi factum est per vivas experientias perplures, 
adeo ut nullum dubium mihi sit relictum; immo mirantur spiritus, si quisquam de eo dubitaret sed quia pauci sunt qui de angelis et spiritibus aliam ideam habent quam qualem de immateriali, ac inde 
quod forent modo cogitationes, ita quod vix substantiae, minus quod sicut homines sensu visus, sensu auditus, et sensu tactus gauderent, et adhuc minus quod illis respiratio, et inde illis vita sicut 
homini sed interior, qualis est vita spiritus respective ad hominis {2}, ideo licet adhuc experientias adducere: </p>
<p>[2] quondam praedicebatur mihi antequam dormitum irem quod essent plures qui contra 
me conspirarent animo me interimendi per suffocationem, sed nihil ad eorum minas attendi, quia tutus a Domine quare secure indormiebam; verum nocte media expergefactus sensi manifeste quod non respirarem 
a me, sed quod ex caelo; </p>
<p>respiratio enim non erat mea, sed usque respirabam.  Alioquin innumeris vicibus datum est sentire animationem seu respirationem spirituum et quoque angelorum, per 
id quo illi in me respirarent, et quod mea respiratio usque simul adesset distincta ab illorum; </p>
<p>sed hoc sentire nemo potest nisi cui aperta sunt interiora, et per illud communicatio data cum caelo. @1 
before per amorem$ @2 spiritui respective ad hominem$ </p>
