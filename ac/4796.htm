<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4796节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4796.</strong>当天使显为可见时，他们的一切内层情感都从脸上清晰地看出并闪耀出来，以致脸就是这些情感的一个外在形式和代表形像。在天堂，除了表达情感的脸外，是不可以拥有其它任何脸的。那些冒充别人脸的人会从社群被逐出。由此明显可知，脸对应于总体的一切内层，既对应于人的情感，也对应于他的思维，或既对应于他意愿里面的情感，也对应于他理解力里面的思维。这也解释了为何在圣言中，“脸”，无论单数还是复数，表示情感；主向某人“仰脸”表示祂出于属于爱的神性情感而怜悯他。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4796</b></p><p><b>4796.</b>
When angels present themselves to the sight, all their interior affections appear clearly and shine forth from the face, so that the face is an external form and representative image of them. It is not 
permitted in heaven to have any other face than that of one's affections. Those who simulate another face are cast out from the society. From this it is evident that the face corresponds to all the 
interiors in general, both to man's affections and to his thoughts, or to what is of his will and to what is of his understanding. Hence also in the Word by "face" and "faces" are signified affections; 
and by the Lord's "lifting up His faces" upon anyone, is signified that He pities him from Divine affection, which is of love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4796</b></p><p><b>4796.</b>
When angels manifest themselves visually, all their interior affections are seen clearly in their faces and shine out of them, so that the face is the external form and a representative image of those 
affections. To have any other face than that expressing their affections is not allowed in heaven Those who deceitfully wear any other face are expelled from that community. From this it is evident 
that the face corresponds to everything in general present interiorly - both to a person's affections and to his thoughts, that is, to the affections in his will and to the thoughts in his understanding. 
This also explains why in the Word 'face', whether a singular or a plural noun, means affections; and when it is said that the Lord lifts up His face on someone, the meaning is that out of Divine 
Affection belonging to His Love He has compassion on him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4796</b>
</p><b>4796.</b>
Cum angeli se visibiles sistunt, apparent omnes affectiones interiores eorum clare ex {1} facie et inde elucent, sic ut facies sit (c)illarum (t)forma externa et imago repraesentativa; aliam faciem 
habere quam affectionum suarum, non datur in caelo; qui aliam faciem mentiuntur, illi ejiciuntur e societate; inde patet quod facies correspondeat interioribus in genere omnibus, sunt intellectus 
apud hominem; inde etiam in Verbo per faciem et fac tam ejus affectionibus quam cogitationibus, seu quae sunt voluntatis et quae sunt intellectus apud hominem; inde etiam in Verbo per faciem et facies 
significantur affectiones; et per `quod Dominus elevet facies super aliquem quod ex Divina affectione quae est Amoris, ejus misereatur.      @1 in$ </p>
