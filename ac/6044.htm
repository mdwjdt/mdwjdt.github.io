<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6044节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6044.</strong>“这些人本是牧羊的人”表他们引向良善。这从“牧羊的人”的含义清楚可知，“牧羊的人”是指那些引向良善的人（参看<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="3795.htm">3795</a>，<a href="5201.htm">5201</a>节）。因为牧羊的人，或牧人是进行教导和引导的人，而“羊群”是被教导和引导的人。但就内义而言，所表示的是引向良善的真理，此处“这些人本是牧羊的人”所指的以色列的儿子们代表属灵真理（<a href="6040.htm">6040</a>节）；此外，存在于那些教导之人当中的真理就是那进行教导的。前面已说明，信，即信之本质，引向良善，即仁之本质。这一点从以下事实也明显可知：每一个事物都与一个目的有关，并关注这个目的，凡不关注一个目的的事物都不可能持续存在。因为若不是为了一个目的；主从不创造任何事物。这是千真万确的，以至于可以说目的是一切受造物中的全部。一切受造物都存在于这种秩序中。正如目的从那首先者通过居间物或方法关注最后之物，最后之物里面的目的也关注那首先者里面的目的。这就是事物联结的方式。就其最初源头而言，目的本身无非是神性之爱的神性良善，因而是主自己。这也是为何在圣言中，祂被称为“首先的和末后的”、“阿拉法和俄梅戛”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.4.htm">41:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.6.htm">44:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.12.htm">48:12</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.8.htm">1:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.8.htm">2:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.13.htm">22:13</a>）。<br />既然如此，那么属于人生活的每一个方面都有必要与一个目的有关，并关注这个目的。但凡有点理性的人都能看出，一个人所拥有的记忆知识都视真理为它们的目的，而真理则视良善为它们的目的，良善视主为它们最后和最初的目的，出于真理关注主时是最后目的，出于良善关注主时是最初目的。这就是教会所拥有的真理的情形，即它们引向良善，这一点由“这些人本是牧羊的人”，以及下文“因为他们是养牲畜的人”来表示。</p>

And the men are shepherds of the flock. That this signifies that they lead to good, is evident from the signification of "shepherds of the flock," as being those who lead to good (see n. 343, 3795, 5201). 
For he is a "shepherd" who teaches and leads, and that is the "flock" which is taught and led. But in the internal sense are meant truths which lead to good, for by the sons of Israel, who here 
are the "men, shepherds of the flock," are represented spiritual truths (n. 6040). Moreover with those who teach it is truths that lead. That truths which are of faith lead to good which is of charity, 
was shown above; and the same is evident from the fact that all things both in general and in particular have relation to an end, and look to it, and those which do not look to an end cannot subsist. 
For the Lord has created nothing whatever except for the sake of an end; in so much that it may be said that the end is the all in all things that have been created; and all things that have been created 
are in such an order that as the end from the First through the intermediates looks to the last or ultimate, so the end within the last or ultimate has regard to the end in the First. Hence comes 
the connection of things. In its first origin the end itself is nothing but the Divine good of the Divine love; thus it is the Lord Himself. Wherefore also in the Word He is called the "First and the 
Last," the "Alpha and Omega" (Isa. 41:4; 44:6; 48:12; Rev. 1:8, 11, 17; 2:8; 21:6; 22:13). This being the case, it is necessary that each and all things which pertain to the life with man should have 
relation to an end and should look to it. He who has any rational ability can see that the memory-knowledges with a man look to truths as their end, and that the truths look to goods, and that the goods 
look to the Lord as the last and the first end; as the last end when they look at Him from truths, and as the first end when they look at Him from good. Such is the case with the truths of the church 
that they lead to good, which is signified by the "men being shepherds of the flock," and by their being "men of cattle," as now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6044</b></p><p><b>6044.</b>
'And the men are shepherds of the flock' means that they lead to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'shepherds of the flock' as those who lead to good, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="3795.htm">3795</a>, <a href="5201.htm">5201</a>; for a shepherd 
or pastor is one who teaches and leads, and the flock one who is taught or led; but in the internal sense truths that lead to good are meant since the sons of Israel, to whom 'the men are shepherds 
of the flock' refers here, represent spiritual truths, <a href="6040.htm">6040</a>, and also since truths present with those who teach are what do the leading. It has been shown previously that truths, which are the essence 
of faith, lead to good, which is the essence of charity. This is also evident from the consideration that every single thing is related to an end and has that end in view, and that things which do 
not have an end in view cannot remain in being. For the Lord has never created anything for any other reason than its end in view. So true is this that one may speak of the end as the all in all created 
things. And created things exist within this state of order: Even as the end looks from Him who is the First through means to what is last, so the end within what is last looks to the end in Him who 
is the First. This is the way things link together. By virtue of its very own origin the end itself is nothing else than the Divine Good of Divine Love, thus the Lord Himself, which also is why in the 
Word He is called the First and the Last, the Alpha and the Omega, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:4;%2044:6;%2048:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:4; 44:6; 48:12</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:8,%2011,%2017;%202:8;%2021:6,%2022:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:8, 11, 17; 2:8; 21:6, 22:13</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This being so, every single aspect of the life a person has looks 
to an end and has that end in view. Anyone who is at all rational can see that the factual knowledge a person has looks to truths as its end in view, and that truths look to forms of good as their 
end in view, and that forms of good look to the Lord as their last and first ends in view, their last when motivated by truths, their first when motivated by good. This is how it is with the truths the 
Church possesses, in that they lead to good, meant by 'the men are shepherds of the flock' and by 'they are keepers of livestock', as in what follows below. </p>

`Et viri pastores gregis':  quod significet quod ducant ad bonum, constat a significatione `pastorum gregis' quod sint qui ducunt ad bonum, de qua n. 343, 3795, 5201; est enim `pastor' qui docet et 
ducit, et `grex' qui docetur et ducitur, sed in sensu interno intelliguntur vera quae ducunt ad bonum, nam per `filios Israelis' qui hic sunt `viri pastores gregis', repraesentantur vera spiritualia, 
n. 6040; etiam vera sunt apud illos qui docent quae ducunt.  Quod vera quae fidei, ducant ad bonum quod charitatis, prius ostensum est; et quoque patet ex eo quod omnia et singula se referant ad finem 
et spectent illum, et quae non finem spectant non possint subsistere; Dominus enim nihil usquam creavit nisi propter finem, usque adeo ut dici queat quod {1} finis sit omne in omnibus quae creata sunt; 
et quae creata sunt, in illo ordine sunt ut sicut finis a Primo {2}per medios spectet ultimum, ita finis in ultimo spectet finem in Primo; inde rerum nexus; ipse finis in prima sua origine non est 
nisi Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, ita est Ipse Dominus; unde etiam in Verbo vocatur Primus et Ultimus, Alpha et Omega, Esai. xli 4, xliv 6, xlviii (x)12, Apoc. i 8, 11, 17, ii 8, xxi 6, xxii 13.  [2]Cum 
ita sit, necessum est ut omnia et singula quae vitae apud hominem, se referant ad finem et spectent illum, {3}; qui aliquo rationali pollet, videre potest quod scientifica apud hominem spectent vera 
ut suum finem, et quod vera spectent bona, et quod bona spectent Dominum ut finem ultimum et primum, ut finem ultimum cum a veris, {4}et ut finem primum cum a bono.  Ita se habet cum veris Ecclesiae 
quod ducant ad bonum quod significatur per `viros pastores gregis', et per `viros pecoris', ut sequitur. @1 i inde$ @2 tendat ad$ @3 i quia finis a Domino est in singulis$ @4 at A, est I$ </p>
