<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第151节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>151.</strong>创世记2:22 耶和华神就用那人身上所取的肋骨，建成一个女人，领她到那人跟前。<br />“建”，表立起曾经倒下的，“肋骨”，表无生气的自我，“女人”，表被主赋予了生气的自我，“领她到那人跟前”，表主赐予人自我。上古教会的后代不愿像父辈那样成为属天之人，而希望自我引导。他们既渴望自我，主就许了他们。但是主将生气注入其中，因此它被称为一个“女人”，接着又被称为“妻子”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]151.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_151/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_22" target=_top>Genesis 2:22</a>. And Jehovah God built a woman out of the rib that he took from the human and brought her to the human.<br />Building means reconstructing what has fallen down. A rib symbolizes a sense of self devoid of life. A woman symbolizes a sense of self brought to life by the Lord. Bringing her to the human means giving people a sense of self.<br />Unlike their parents, the members of the generation that inherited the earliest church preferred not to have a heavenly character but to lead themselves. They sought selfhood or a sense of autonomy, so it was yielded to them. Still, it was a living selfhood, vivified by the Lord, so it is called a woman and later a wife. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 151</b></p><p><b>151.</b>
Verse 22. And the rib which Jehovah God had taken from the man He built into a woman, and brought her to the man. By to "build" is signified to raise up what has fallen; by the "rib" man's Own not vivified; 
by a "woman" man's own vivified by the Lord; by "He brought her to the man" that what is his own was granted him. The posterity of this church did not wish, like their parents, to be a celestial 
man, but to be under their own self-guidance; and, thus inclining to their Own, it was granted to them, but still an Own vivified by the Lord, and therefore called a "woman" and afterwards a "wife." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 151</b></p><p><b>151.</b>
Verse 22 And Jehovah God built the rib which He took from the man into a woman, and brought her to the man.  </p>
<p>'Building means reconstructing that which has fallen down, 'rib' the proprium that has 
not been given life, 'woman the proprium that has been given life by the Lord, 'bringing her to the man' that a proprium was granted to him. Since the descendants of this Church, unlike their ancestors, 
did not wish to be the celestial man, but to be their own guides and so set their heart on the proprium, they were allowed to have one. It was however a proprium given life by the Lord, which is why 
it is called 'a woman', and after that 'a wife'.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 151</b>
</p><b>151.</b>
Vers. 22.  Et aedificavit Jehovah Deus costam, quam sumpsit de homine, in mulierem, et adduxit eam ad hominem.  Per 'aedificare' significatur exstruere quod lapsum est; per 'costam' proprium non vivificatum; 
per 'mulierem' proprium a Domino vivificatum; per 'adducere ad hominem' quod ei proprium datum sit. Posteritas hujus Ecclesiae, quia non ut parentes caelestis homo voluit esse sed semet ducere, 
et sic affectavit proprium, ei quoque concessum est, sed usque a Domino vivificatum, quare vocatur mulier, et postea uxor. </p>
