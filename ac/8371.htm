<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">木星的灵人和居民-续</h4><br />8371.来自木星的灵人告知我关于木星居民的各种事，如他们的走路方式、饮食和家园等等。就他们的行走方式而言，他们不像这个和许多其它星球的居民那样直立行走，也不像动物那样四足行走。相反，他们行走时，会用手掌来协助自己，交替半直着身子站立行走；每走三步还把脸转到侧面和身后，同时身体略微弯曲。他们很快就完成这些动作，因为在他们中间，让别人看不到脸，是不得体的。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH JUPITER. I have been further informed by the spirits who are from that earth about various things that concern its inhabitants, such 
as their walk, their food, their homes, and the like. As regards their walk, they do not walk erect like the inhabitants of this and of many other earths, nor do they creep in the manner of animals, but 
when they are walking they assist themselves with the palms of their hands, and alternately half raise themselves on their feet, and also at every third step turn the face to the side and behind them, 
and also at the same time bend the body a little, which is done rapidly. For among them it is unbecoming to be looked at by others except in the face. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER - continued </p>
<p>To resume what spirits belonging to that planet have told me about various things characteristic of its inhabitants, let me turn to such matters 
as their manner of walking, their food, homes, and the like. So far as their manner of walking is concerned, they do not go erect as inhabitants of this and a large number of other planets do; 
nor do they go on all fours in the manner of animals. Rather, when they walk they help themselves along with the palms of their hands, and alternately half raise themselves to stand on their feet. Every 
third step they also turn their face looking to the side and behind them, and at the same time bend their body round slightly. They do this quickly, because among them it is improper for them to be 
looked at by others except in the face. </p>

Continuatio de Spiritibus et Incolis Telluris Jovis </p>
<p>Porro a spiritibus qui ex illa tellure {1}, informatus sum de variis quae apud incolas ibi, ut de (t)illorum gressu, de cibis, {2}et domiciliis, 
et similibus.  Quod gressum illorum concernit, non ambulant erecti sicut incolae hujus telluris et plurium aliarum, nec repunt more animalium, sed cum gradiuntur, adjuvant se palmis et alternis vicibus 
se ad dimidium super pedes elevant, et quoque in gradiendo quovis tertio passu facie spectant ad latus et post se, et tunc etiam paulum inflectunt corpus quod fit repente, nam apud illos indecorum 
est ab aliis (x)spectari quam a facie. 	@1 i sunt$ 	@2 de$ </p>
