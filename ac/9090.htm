<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9090节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9090.</strong>“人的牛若击伤了他同伴的牛”表具有不同情感的两种真理，这一种的情感会伤害那一种的情感。这从“击伤”、“牛”和“人”的含义清楚可知：“击伤”是指伤害真理，如前所述（<a href="9057.htm">9057</a>节）；“牛”是指在属世人中对良善的情感，在反面意义上是指对邪恶的情感，也如前所述（<a href="9065.htm">9065</a>节）；“人”是指真理（<a href="9034.htm">9034</a>节），因此，“人”与“他的同伴”表示两种真理。之所以表示不同的情感，是因为它们是彼此伤害的牛，而牛表示情感。事实上，不同的事物彼此伤害，而没有什么不同的事物则不会。<br />那些不了解代表和对应的性质之人可能会惊讶地发现，牛能表示人里面对良善或邪恶的情感，是因为牛是牲畜。不过，要让他知道，一切牲畜都表示诸如属于某种情感或倾向的那类事物。在灵界，这一点是众所周知的，因为在灵界，各种动物经常出现，如牛、小公牛、母牛、马、骡、驴、绵羊、山羊、小山羊、羔羊，以及恶兽，如老虎、黑豹、熊、狗、猪和蛇，还有地上看不到的走兽；除此之外也有各种各样的鸟。<br />这类生物就出现在那里，这一观念远远超出那些以为除了肉眼看见的东西外什么都不存在之人的信念。不过，这些人也拒绝相信灵人或天使的存在，甚至拒绝相信以下观念：他们在自己看来就是人，能看见彼此，互相交谈，互相接触。不信的原因是，这些人如此感官和肉体化，以至于以为唯独肉体活着。这就是为何如前所棕，这些生物远远超出他们的信念。然而，我不仅上千次地看见它们，还被告知我所看见的那些生物来自何处，表示什么；因而也被告知，当以动物的形式呈为可见时，属世人中对良善的情感表现为无害的牛；对邪恶的情感则表现为有害的牛；其它一切情感则表现为其它动物的形式。正因如此，各种不同的动物都表示一个人里面与它们相对应的各种情感。关于这个主题，可参看前面的说明（<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="719.htm">719</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>，<a href="2805.htm">2805</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>，<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>，<a href="7523.htm">7523</a>节）。</p>

And when a man's ox shall strike the ox of his companion. That this signifies two truths the affections of which are diverse, and the affection of one injures the affection of the other, is evident from 
the signification of "to strike," as being the injuring of truth (of which above, n. 9057); from the signification of "an ox," as being the affection of good, and in the opposite sense, the affection 
of evil, in the natural man (of which also above, n. 9065); and from the signification of "a man" [vir] as being truth (n. 9034); hence by "a man" and "his companion" are signified two truths. That 
diverse affections are signified, is because it is oxen (by which the affections are signified) which injure each other; for things which are diverse injure each other, but not things which are not 
diverse. [2] He who does not know how the case is with representatives and correspondences may wonder that an ox can signify the affection of good or of evil in man, because an ox is a beast. But let 
him know that all beasts signify such things as belong to some affection or inclination. In the spiritual world this is very well known, for in that world there are frequently seen beasts of various 
kinds, as oxen, bullocks, cows, horses, mules, asses, sheep, goats, kids, lambs; also evil beasts, as tigers, panthers, bears, dogs, hogs, serpents; and also beasts which are nowhere seen on the earth; 
besides also birds of various kinds. [3] That such things are seen there surpasses belief with those who believe that nothing exists which they do not see with their bodily eyes. But neither do the 
same believe that there are any spirits or angels, still less that they appear to themselves as men; that they see one another; speak with one another; and touch one another. The reason is that such 
persons are so sensuous and corporeal as to believe that only bodies live. It is from this that, as before said, such things surpass belief with them. And yet they have not only been seen by me a thousand 
times, but I have also been instructed concerning the animals seen; whence they are, and what they signify; thus also that when presented to view in an animal form, affections of good in the natural 
are seen as gentle oxen; and affections of evil as ferocious oxen; and that all other affections appear in the forms of other animals. Hence it is that beasts of various kinds signify such things 
in man as they correspond to. (But on this subject see what has been previously shown, n. 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 2781, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3218, 3519, 5198, 7523.) </p>

'And when a man's ox inflicts a blow on [his] companion's ox' means two truths with dissimilar affections, and the affection with one injures that with the other. This is clear from the meaning of 'inflicting 
a blow' as injuring truth, dealt with above in <a href="9057.htm">9057</a>; from the meaning of 'an ox' as an affection for good, and in the contrary sense an affection for evil in the natural, also dealt with above, 
in <a href="9065.htm">9065</a>; and from the meaning of 'a man' as truth, dealt with in <a href="9034.htm">9034</a>, so that 'man' and 'companion' mean two truths. The reason why dissimilar affections are what are meant is that they are oxen, 
by which affections are meant, that injure each other. For things which are dissimilar injure each other, but not those which are not dissimilar. </p>

 Those unacquainted with the nature of representatives 
and correspondences may be astonished to learn that 'an ox', being a beast, can mean an affection for good or an affection for evil present with a person But let them know that all beasts mean 
such things as belong to some affection or inclination. This is very well known in the spiritual world, for various kinds of beasts frequently make their appearance there, such as oxen' young bulls, 
cows, horses, mules, asses, sheep, she-goats, kids, and lambs; also evil beasts, such as tigers, panthers, bears, dogs, pigs, and serpents, as well as beasts seen nowhere on our planet; and in addition 
various kinds of birds. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The idea that such creatures make their appearance there lies far beyond the belief of those who suppose that nothing exists apart from what they see with their bodily 
eyes. But these same people also refuse to believe in the existence of spirits or angels, even more so in the idea that they appear to themselves as persons, see one another, talk to one another, and 
touch one another. Their incredulity is due to their thinking so much on the level of the senses and the body that they suppose their bodies alone are living. This is why, as has been stated, the idea 
of such creatures lies far beyond their belief. But I have not only seen such sights thousands of times; I have also been told where the creatures I have seen come from, and what they are signs of. 
I have also accordingly been told that, when presented visually in animal forms, affections for good in the natural appear as harmless oxen, and affections for evil as harmful oxen, and that all other 
affections are presented in the forms of other animals. So it is that different kinds of beasts are the signs of the various kinds of affections in a person to which they correspond. But regarding these 
matters see what has been shown already in <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>-<a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="719.htm">719</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="2805.htm">2805</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>, <a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>, <a href="7523.htm">7523</a>. </p>

`Et cum plaga affecerit bos viri bovem socii [sui]': quod significet duo vera quorum affectiones diversae sunt, et unius laeserit alterius, constat ex significatione `plaga afficere' quod sit laesio 
veri, de qua supra n. 9057, ex significatione `bovis' quod sit affectio boni, et in opposito sensu affectio mali in naturali, de qua etiam supra n. 9065, et ex significatione `viri' quod sit verum, de 
qua n. 9034; inde per `virum' et `socium' significantur duo vera; quod affectiones diversae sint {1} quae significantur, est quia (o)sunt `boves,' per quos affectiones significantur, (o)qui se laedunt; 
nam quae diversa sunt se laedunt, non autem quae non diversa. 	[2] Qui non scit quomodo cum repraesentativis et correspondentiis se habet, mirari potest quod `bos' possit significare affectionem 
boni aut mali apud hominem, quia est bestia; sed sciat quod omnes bestiae significent talia quae alicujus affectionis aut inclinationis sunt; in spirituali mundo hoc notissimum est, apparent enim ibi 
frequenter bestiae varii generis, sicut boves, juvenci, vaccae, equi, muli, asini, oves, caprae, (o)haedi, agni, tum bestiae malae, ut {2} tigrides, pantherae, ursi, canes, (o)sues, serpentes, et quoque 
bestiae quae in tellure nullibi conspectae {3}, praeter etiam aves varii generis. 	[3] Quod talia ibi appareant, excedit fidem apud illos qui credunt nihil esse quod non oculis corporeis vident; sed 
iidem nec credunt quod aliqui spiritus aut angeli sint, minus quod appareant sibi ut homines, se mutuo videant, inter se loquantur, se tangant; causa est quia tam sensuales (c)ac corporei sunt ut credant 
modo corpora vivere; inde est quod, ut dictum, talia excedant fidem apud illos; sed non modo millies mihi visa sunt, verum etiam instructus sum (o)de animalibus visis unde sunt {4} et quid significant, 
ita quoque quod affectiones boni in naturali, cum in forma animali sistuntur videndae, appareant ut boves (o)mites, et affectiones mali ut boves immites, et (o)quod reliquae affectiones in aliorum 
animalium formis; inde est quod bestiae varii generis {5} significent apud hominem talia {6} quibus correspondent {7}; sed de his videantur quae prius ostensa sunt n. 142, 143, 246, 714-716, 719, 
1823, 2179, 2180, 2781, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3218, 3519, 5198, 7523. @1 Before affectiones$ @2 sicut$ @3 i sunt$ @4 apparent$ @5 i in Verbo$ @6 Before apud$ @7 i et inde quoque in sacrificiis$ </p>
