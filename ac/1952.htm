<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1952.</strong>创世记16:13，14. 她就称那对她说话的耶和华名为“你是看见我的神”，因为她说，我也在这里在看见我的那一位后面看见吗？所以，她称那水泉为“看见我的活着的那一位的水泉”。看哪，这水泉就在加低斯和巴列之间。<br />“她就称那对她说话的耶和华名为”表主的内层人在思想这些事时的状态。“你是看见我的神”表流注。“祂看见我之后，我也在这里看见了吗”表没有以理性为媒介而进入外层人生命的流注。“所以，她称那水泉”表真理的衍生状态。“看见我的活着的那一位的水泉”表因此清晰可见的真理。“看哪，这水泉就在加低斯和巴列之间”表该真理的性质。</p>

Verses 13, 14. And she called the name of Jehovah who was speaking unto her, Thou God seest me; for she said, Have I also here seen after Him that seeth me? Therefore she called the fountain, The fountain 
of the Living One who seeth me; behold it is between Kadesh and Bared. "And she called the name of Jehovah who was speaking unto her," signifies the state of the Lord's interior man when it thought 
about these things. "Thou God seest Me," signifies influx; "for she said, Have I also here seen after Him that seeth me?" signifies influx into the life of the exterior man without the rational as 
a medium; "therefore she called the fountain," signifies the derivative state of truth; "the fountain of the Living One who seeth me," signifies truth thus clearly seen; "behold it is between Kadesh 
and Bared," signifies its quality. </p>

Verses 13, 14 And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, You are a God who sees me; for she said, Have I not also here seen after Him who sees me? Therefore she called the spring, The spring 
of the Living One who sees me; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bared. </p>
<p>'And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her' means the state of the Lord's Interior Man when it thought about these 
things. 'You are a God who sees me' means influx. 'For she said, Have I not also here seen after Him who sees me?' means influx into the life of the exterior man without the rational serving as a go-between. 
'Therefore she called the spring' means the resulting state of truth. 'The spring of the Living One who sees me' means the truth that was thus clearly visible. 'Behold, it is between Kadesh and 
Bared' means the nature of [this truth]. </p>

Vers. 13, 14.  Et vocavit nomen Jehovae loquentis ad se, Tu Deus videns me, quia dixit, Num etiam hic vidi post videntem me? Propterea vocavit fontem, fons Vivo videnti me, ecce inter Kadesh et inter 
Bared. `Et vocavit nomen Jehovae loquentis ad se' significat statum Interioris Hominis Domini cum illa cogitavit: `Tu Deus videns me' significat influxum: `quia dixit, Num etiam hic vidi post videntem 
me?' significat influxum in exterioris hominis vitam absque rationali medio: `propterea vocavit fontem' significat statum veri inde: `fons Vivo videnti me' significat verum ita conspicuum: `ecce inter 
Kadesh et inter Bared' significat qualitatem. </p>
