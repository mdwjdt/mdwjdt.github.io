<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第829节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>829.</strong>人若在肉身生活期间只想着纵欲，并且将其他人所说的一切话，甚至神圣事物都扭向这类情欲，即便不再有刺激他们的属世情欲，还是这样思想，那么在来生，他们会继续以这种方式思维和言谈。由于在灵界，其思想是相通的，有时他们会在其他精灵面前有淫秽的表现，所以他们会有冒犯。他们的惩罚乃是这样：当着他们所冒犯的精灵们的面，他们滚在地上，象一面鼓那样从左到右迅速翻滚，然后再从另一个方向横向翻滚。照其纵欲的本性，他们在所有人面前全裸，或半裸，同时充满羞耻。这时，他们的头和交叉的双脚像一个纺锤那样旋转起来，由此引发阻力，同时还有疼痛。因为有两股力在作用，一股力旋转，另一股力向后扯拉。因此，这种惩罚伴随着被撕裂的痛苦。经历这些惩罚后，这个痛苦的冒犯者会得到机会偷偷溜出精灵的视线，一种强烈的羞耻感会注入到他里面。尽管如此，还会有人考验他，以确定他是否仍坚持这样做。不过，只要处在羞耻和疼痛的状态，他会保持戒备心理。因此，在他自己看来，他似乎隐藏了起来，尽管他们都知道他在何处。这种惩罚发生在前面一段距离处。也有一些男孩、青少年和年轻人由于无知的愚蠢和那个年龄的性冲动，吸收了可憎的观念，认为妻子，尤其是年轻漂亮的那种，不是为其丈夫准备的，而是为他们和象他们这样的其他人准备的，而丈夫只负责家务和抚养孩子。在来生，通过其孩子气的声音也能认出他们。在那里，他们在后面某个高处。在来生，他们当中那些确信这些观念，并照之生活的人会受到严厉惩罚。那些擅长欺骗其他人，使其认为他们在肉体中，同时能引发疼痛的精灵会使他们的关节脱臼，然后复位，或扭在一起，然后扭回去。通过这些粗暴的往复动作，连同抵抗时的挣扎，他们会遭受严重猛击，以致他们似乎被肢解，并被撕成碎片，伴随着可怕的巨痛。这种惩罚会反复进行，直到他们对这类生活原则感到恐惧，不再这样思考为止。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]829.</strong> Some during their bodily life think lewdly and turn whatever others say into something indecent, even if the subject is holy, and they continue to do so even into adulthood and old age, when nothing of earthly lust remains to goad them. Neither do they stop thinking and speaking this way in the other world. Since in that world their thoughts are shared generally, and sometimes present themselves in obscene form to the eyes of other spirits, they cause offense.<br />Their punishment consists in being laid out flat before the spirits they have hurt and spun quickly from left to right like a scroll. Then they are spun crosswise in another position, and then in yet another, stripped naked in the sight of all, or else half-naked (depending on the nature of their debauchery). All the while they suffer shame. Next they are twirled horizontally by their head and feet as if around an axis. Resistance is triggered in them, together with pain, since two forces are acting, one spinning one direction and the other pushing back. So the procedure tears them apart in an agonizing way.<br />At the end of all this, the individuals have a chance to remove themselves from the gaze of other spirits, and they are filled with shame. Still there are some spirits who test them to see whether they will persist in such behavior. But as long as they continue to feel humiliation and pain, they shy away from it. So they hide, despite the fact that others know just where they are.<br />This punishment appeared in front, some distance away.<br />[2] There are also boys, adolescents, and young men who in their youthful folly and lust have taken it as a principle (a horrendous one) that a wife — especially one who is young and beautiful — should not belong to her husband but to themselves and others like them. The only role they leave to the husband is as head of household and educator of the children. In the other life they are distinguished by the childish sound of their voices. They are at the back and fairly high up.<br />The ones who have hardened themselves in these principles and in actually living their lives by them undergo wretched punishment in the other life. They suffer dislocation and rearticulation of their joints, or having their limbs wrenched in one direction and then the other. The spirits who administer the punishment know how to create the illusion of a body and along with it the physical sensation of pain. The back-and-forth motion and the resistance to it induced in them at the same time tear at them so violently that they seem to themselves to be ripped into minute shreds, with excruciating pain. The process repeats until, struck with horror for a life based on such principles, they abandon their former way of thinking. </p>

They who in the life of the body think lasciviously, and give a lascivious turn to whatever others say, even to holy things, and this even in adult and old age when nothing of natural lasciviousness 
incites, do not desist or think and speak differently in the other life; and as there their thoughts are communicated, and sometimes come forth into obscene representations before other spirits, they 
give offense. Their punishment is, that in the presence of the spirits whom they have offended they are thrown prostrate and rapidly rolled over and over like a roller from left to right, and then transversely 
in another position, and so in another-naked before all, or half naked, according to the nature of their lasciviousness, and at the same time they are inspired with shame. Then they are whirled 
about by the head and feet, horizontally, as upon an axis. Resistance is induced, and at the same time pain; for there are two forces acting, one whirling around, the other backward, so that the punishment 
is attended with the pain of being torn asunder. After undergoing these penalties, an opportunity is afforded the miserable sufferer of withdrawing himself from the sight of other spirits, and 
a sense of shame is instilled into him. Yet there are those who try him to see whether he still persists in such things; but so long as he is in a state of shame and distress he is on his guard. Thus 
he seems to himself to be hidden, although they know where he is. This punishment appeared in front, at some distance.      There are also boys, youths, and young men who from the madness and hot 
desire of their age have conceived abominable principles: as that wives, especially those that are young and beautiful, ought not to be for a husband, but for themselves and their like, the husband remaining 
only head of the household and educator of the children. These are distinguished in the other life by the boyish sound of their speech. They are behind at some height there. Those of them who 
have confirmed themselves in such principles, and in actual life conformable thereto, are grievously punished in the other life, by having their joints put out of place and back again, or twisted one 
way and the other, by spirits who can by their art induce upon them the phantasy of being in the body, and at the same time make them feel bodily pain. By these violent alternations, together with their 
struggles in resistance, they are so rent that they seem to themselves as if dismembered and torn to bits, with frightful pain; and this time after time, until being struck with horror at such principles 
of life they cease to think in that way. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 829</b></p><p><b>829.</b>
People whose thoughts during their lifetime have consisted of unrestrained lust and who have twisted all that others say, even things that are holy, into such lust - doing so even when mature and elderly, 
when no natural lust is present to incite them - continue to think and talk in that manner in the next life. And because their thoughts in that life are communicated, and sometimes end up as lewd 
representations among other spirits, consequently into things that are offensive, their punishment is this: In the presence of the spirits they have offended they are thrown to the ground in a horizontal 
position, and are rolled over and over rapidly from left to right like a drum, then back in a different direction, and in yet another. Naked in the presence of all, or half-naked, depending on the 
nature of their unrestrained lust, they are at the same time filled with shame. Then they are spun around by the head and feet crossways like a spindle. Resistance is set up and simultaneously pain, 
for two forces are at work, the first going round one way and the second in reverse, producing a painful ripping apart. When all this is finished the offender is given the opportunity to sneak away 
from the gaze of the spirits, and a sense of shame is instilled into him. Nevertheless there are those who test him to see whether he still persists in such ways. But as long as his state is one of shame 
and pain he is on his guard. It may thus seem to him that he is hidden, but they know his whereabouts. This punishment was seen to take place in front, some distance away. </p>

 There are also boys, 
adolescents, and young men who, because of the senseless folly and the sexual urge of that time of life, have adopted unspeakable notions to the effect that wives, especially young and attractive 
ones, were intended not for their husbands but for themselves and others like them, with the husbands remaining purely heads of the household and those who bring up the children. They are recognized also 
in the next life from the boyish sound of their speech. They are at the back there, a fair way up. Those among them who have confirmed themselves in those notions, and in a life in keeping with the 
same, are pitiably rough-handled in the next life by having their joints dislocated and then put back in place - that is, twisted together and then twisted back - by spirits who have the skill to delude 
others into thinking that they are in the body, and at the same time to induce the sensation of pain. By means of these rebounding movements, along with the simultaneous resistance offered to them, 
they are so severely battered that they seem to themselves to have disintegrated into tiny particles with the immense pain of it all. And this is repeated many times until they have been struck through 
with horror for such notions about the way to live and so refrain from thinking in this way. </p>

</p><b>829.</b>
(x)Qui in vita corporis lascive cogitant, et quicquid alii loquuntur, in lasciviam convertunt, etiam sancta; et quidem dum adulti et senes, cum nihil lasciviae naturalis sufflat; ii nec desistunt aliter 
cogitare et loqui in altera vita; et quia ibi cogitationes eorum communicantur, et quandoque apud alios spiritus in repraesentationes obscenas evadunt, inde scandala; poena eorum est quod coram spiritibus 
quos laeserant, sternantur horizontaliter et circumrotentur sicut volumen a sinistro ad dextrum festine, dein transversim alio situ, et sic in alio, nudi coram omnibus aut seminudi, secundum 
lasciviae qualitatem, et simul pudor eis incutitur; tum circumvolvuntur a capite et pedibus in modum axeos transversaliter; renisus inditur et simul dolor, nam binae vires agunt, una circum et altera 
retro; ita fit cum distractione dolorifica; quibus peractis datur ei copia se subducendi a conspectu spirituum et insinuatur ei pudor, sed usque sunt qui tentant eum, num adhuc insistat talibus; sed 
quamdiu est in statu pudoris et doloris, cavet; ita sibi latet, tametsi norunt, ubinam: haec poena apparuit antrorsum ad aliquam distantiam.  Sunt quoque pueri, adolescentes et juvenes, qui ex vesania 
aetatis et pruritu conceperunt principia nefanda, quod uxores cumprimis juveniles et venustae, non debeant esse marito, sed sibi, et similibus, marito solum manente patrefamilias et prolis educatore; 
dignoscuntur in altera vita quoque ex sono loquelae puerili; sunt a tergo ad aliquam ibi altitudinem: qui ex iis confirmarunt se in principiis, et actuali conformi vita, miserabiliter in altera vita 
mulctantur per colluxationes et reluxationes, seu contorsiones et retorsiones, a spiritibus qui inducere arte possunt iis phantasiam corporis et simul sensum doloris corporeum, ex quibus reverberationibus, 
cum inductis simul renisibus, ita laniantur, ut quasi (x)frustatim et minutim discissi cum immani dolore sibi videantur; et hoc toties, usque dum talium principiorum vitae horrore perculsi, ita 
cogitare desistant. </p>
