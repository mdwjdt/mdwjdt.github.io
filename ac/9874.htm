<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9874节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9874.</strong>“它们都要镶在金槽中”表总体上它们全部和具体每一个都必须从属于爱的良善发出，属于爱的良善从主获得并展示给主。这从“金”和“镶在槽中”的含义清楚可知：“金”是指爱之良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>，<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>，<a href="9510.htm">9510</a>节）；“镶在槽中”是指从这良善发出。每一块石头都被金子围绕并包裹；由于“金”表示爱之良善，所以被包裹之物表示因这良善存在之物，或从这良善发出之物。镶有两块红玛瑙石并安在以弗得肩带上的金槽（28:11）所表相同。<br />此处的情形是这样：如前所述，胸牌和十二块石头代表众天堂里的一切良善和真理，因而代表整个天堂。此外，不仅众天堂，而且众天堂里的一切社群，事实上一个社群里的每一位天使都被一个神性气场包围，这个气场是由从主发出的神性良善和真理构成的（参看<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>-<a href="9492.htm">9492</a>，<a href="9498.htm">9498</a>，<a href="9499.htm">9499</a>，<a href="9534.htm">9534</a>节）。由于这个气场的良善和真理被天使接受，所以与他们同在的每一个事物都是从那里发出的；因为每一位天使都是一个最小形式的天堂。从主发出的这良善本身就是围绕并包裹石头的金子所代表的。<br />这良善是从主获得并展示给主的爱之良善，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：一切良善皆属于爱，因为凡一个人所爱之物，他都称之为良善，也感觉良善。由此明显可知，属天良善是对主之爱的良善，因为天使和世人通过这爱与主结合，从而被带到祂那里，并享受天堂的一切良善。在教会，众所周知，这良善来自主，因为教会的教义教导，一切良善皆来源于神，无一来源于自我。由此明显可知，展示给主的爱之良善必须来自主，来自其它任何源头的良善都不是良善。</p>

They shall be enclosed in gold in their fillings. That this signifies that each and all things, in general and in particular, shall proceed from the good which is of love from the Lord to the Lord, is 
evident from the signification of "gold," as being the good of love (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510); and from the signification of their being "enclosed in their fillings," 
as being to proceed from it. For each and all of the stones were encompassed and thus enclosed in gold; and as "gold" signifies the good of love, so the enclosing signifies that which is thence derived, 
or that which proceeds from it; in like manner as is signified by the settings of gold with which the two onyx stones were encompassed, and which were put upon the shoulderpieces of the ephod (verse 
11 of this chapter). [2] The case herein in this. As before shown, the breastplate with the twelve stones represented all the good and truth in the heavens, thus the whole heaven; and not only the 
heavens, but also all the societies which are in the heavens, and likewise every angel in a society, are encompassed by the Divine sphere, which is the Divine good and truth that proceeds from the Lord 
(see n. 9490-9492, 9498, 9499, 9534). As the good and truth of this sphere are received by the angels, so also do each and all things with them proceed thence; for every angel is a heaven in the least 
form. This good itself proceeding from the Lord is what is represented by the gold around the stones, and enclosing them.  [3] That this good is the good of love from the Lord to the Lord, can be 
seen from the fact that all good is of love; for that which a man loves he calls good, and also feels to be good. From this it is evident that celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, for an angel 
and a man are conjoined with the Lord by means of this love, and thus are brought to Him, and enjoy all the good of heaven. That this good is from the Lord is known in the church, for its doctrine 
teaches that all good is from the Divine, and nothing from self. From this it is evident that the good of love to the Lord must be from the Lord, and that good from any other source is not good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9874</b></p><p><b>9874.</b>
'Enclosed in gold shall they be in their settings' means that all of them in general and each in particular must emanate from the good belonging to the love that is received from the Lord and shown to 
the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'gold' as the good of love, dealt with in <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>, <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>, <a href="9510.htm">9510</a>; and from the meaning of 'being enclosed in it in their settings' 
as emanating from that good. For every single stone was surrounded by and so enclosed in gold, and since 'gold' means the good of love what is enclosed means that which exists or emanates from that 
good. The like is meant in verse 11 of the present chapter by the sockets of gold which surrounded the two shoham stones placed on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of all 
this are that the breastplate and its twelve stones represented every good and truth in the heavens and so represented all heaven, as shown above. Moreover not only the heavens but also every community 
in the heavens, indeed each angel within a community, is surrounded by a Divine sphere, which consists of Divine Good and Truth emanating from the Lord, see where this is dealt with in <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>-<a href="9492.htm">9492</a>, <a href="9498.htm">9498</a>, <a href="9499.htm">9499</a>, <a href="9534.htm">9534</a>. And since the good and truth of this sphere is received by the angels, so also every single thing present with them emanates from there; for each angel is heaven in the smallest form 
it takes. The actual good emanating from the Lord is what the gold around the stones and enclosing them represents.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The truth that this good is the good of love that is received from the Lord 
and shown to the Lord may be recognized from the consideration that all good belongs to love, for what a person loves he calls good and also feels to be such. From this it is evident that heavenly good 
is the good of love to the Lord, for this love is what joins angel and man to the Lord; through this love they are brought to Him and enjoy all the good of heaven. It is well known in the Church that 
this good comes from the Lord, for the teaching of the Church is that all good originates in God and none at all in oneself. From this it is evident that the good of love shown to the Lord must come 
from the Lord, and that good from any other source is not good.  </p>

`Inclusi auro erunt in oppleturis suis': quod significet quod omnia et singula in communi et in particulari procedent ex bono quod amoris ex Domino in Dominum, constat ex significatione `auri' quod 
sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510, et ex significatione `{1}includi illo in oppleturis suis' quod sit procedere ex illo; nam omnes et singuli lapides circumdabantur 
et sic includebantur auro, et quoniam `aurum' significat bonum amoris, ita inclusio id quod inde est, seu quod inde procedit; simile ac per fundas auri quibus circumdabantur bini lapides schoham, 
qui posti super umeralibus ephodi, vers. 11 hujus capitis. 	[2] {2}Cum his ita se habet: pectorale cum {3}duodecim lapidibus repraesentabat {4}omne bonum et verum in caelis, ita totum caelum, 
ut supra ostensum est, et caeli non solum, sed etiam omnes societates quae in caelis, ut et unusquisque angelus qui in societate, circumdatur Divina sphaera, quae est Divinum Bonum et Verum procedens 
a Domino, de qua videatur n. 9490-9492, 9498, 9499, 9534; sicut recipitur bonum et verum illius sphaerae {5} ab angelis, ita quoque omnia et singula apud illos procedunt inde, nam unusquisque angelus 
est caelum in minima forma; ipsum illud bonum procedens a Domino est quod {6}repraesentatur per auram circum lapides, et includens illos. 	[3] Quod id bonum sit bonum amoris a Domino in Dominum, constare 
potest ex eo quod omne bonum sit amoris, nam quod homo amat, hoc dicit bonum, et quoque sentit bonum; inde patet quod bonum caeleste sit bonum amoris in Dominum, nam per amorem illum conjungitur 
angelus et homo Domino; et sic {7} adducitur ad Ipsum, et fruitur omni bono `caeli'; quod id bonum sit a Domino, notum {9}est in Ecclesia, {10}doctrina enim ejus docet quod omne bonum sit a Divino et 
nihil a semet; inde patet quod bonum amoris in Dominum erit (c)a Domino, et quod bonum aliunde non sit bonum. @1 occludi illis I, includi illis T$ @2 in seq.$ @3 omnibus$ @4 totum coelum, hoc est 
omne bonum et verum in coelis$ @5 i Divina (Divinae intended)$ @6 repraesentatur altered to repraesentabatur$ @7 i is$ @8 in coelis$ @9 potest esse illis$ @10 quia sciunt$ </p>
