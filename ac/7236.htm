<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7236节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7236.</strong>“按着他们的军队”表照着真理里面的良善的属和种。这从“军队”的含义清楚可知，“军队”是指构成信的真理（参看<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>节）。但属灵教会的良善本质上无非是真理，因为当人们照着这些真理生活时，它们就被称为良善。因此，“军队”一词当论及教会中的重生之人时，表示真理的良善，或真理里面的良善。经上之所以说以色列人要“按着他们的军队被领出来”，是因为说他们要从埃及出来的时候，在内义上就是说他们要从与虚假的争战中出来的时候，因而是在他们进行了属灵的战争，或说服完属灵的兵役之后。准确来说，他们“按着他们的军队被领出来”表示他们要照着真理里面的良善被分门别类，因而照着良善的不同种类而被分类。这样做是为了让他们能代表主在众天堂的国度。在那里，所有人都照着各自良善的属和种而在大人里面被分门别类，并分配一个地方。<br />在天堂，所有人都照着他们良善的不同种类而被分门别类；这一事实表明良善何等地多方面和多样化，因为它如此的多样化，以致没有哪两个人的良善是相同的，正如没有哪两个人的面孔是相同的一样；此外，在天堂，良善形成天使的面孔。之所以有无尽的变化，是因为每种形式都由各种不同的事物或部分构成；因为如果有两样事物是完全相同的，那么它们就不是两样事物，而是一个整体了。这也解释了为何在自然界，没有哪两样事物在各个方面是相同的。<br />使得良善如此多样化的，是真理；因为当真理与良善结合时，它就赋予良善以具体的品质。真理是如此的多方面和多样化，以致它能使良善变得如此千差万别；其中一个原因是，真理是无数的，内层真理从外层真理取得一个不同的形式；另外一个原因是，外在感官所获得的虚假印象，以及作为恶欲产物的虚假观念也会把自己粘附上去。因此，由于真理如此地数不胜数，故可以看出，当真理与良善结合时，就会有如此多的变化产生，以致没有哪两样事物是相同的。人若知道仅仅23个字母以不同的方式组合，就会产生所有语言的单词；事实上，即便有成千上万种语言，仍能产生无尽的不同组合，这一点就变得显而易见了。那么，如真理那样千千万万的各种事物的产物又会是什么样呢？这句格言也确认了这一点，即：“有多少人，就有多少意见”，也就是说，观念的多元化和人数一样多。</p>

According to their armies. That this signifies according to the genera and species of good in truths, is evident from the signification of "armies," as being the truths which are of faith (see n. 3448). 
But the goods of the spiritual church are in their essence nothing else than truths, for these are called goods when the life is according to them. Hence by "armies," when said of the regenerate within 
the spiritual church, are signified the goods of truth, or goods in truths. The reason why it is said that the sons of Israel were to be "led forth according to their armies," is that it is said 
of them when going out of Egypt; in the internal sense when they come out of combats with falsities, thus after they have waged spiritual warfare. By their being "led forth according to their armies" 
is properly meant that they were to be classified as to goods in truths, thus into classes according to the qualities of good, and this in order that they might represent the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, 
where all have been classified and allotted a place in the Grand Man according to the quality of the good, both generically and specifically. [2] From the heavens (as all there have been classified 
according to goods) it can be seen how manifold and various good is, for it is so various that one is never in the like good with another; nay, if myriads of myriads were multiplied to eternity, 
the good of one would not be like that of another; just as one person has not the like face as another; moreover, in the heavens good forms the faces of the angels. That there is perpetual variety is 
because every form consists of various distinct things, for if two things were exactly alike, they could not be two things, but one. Hence also it is that in nature there is never one thing in every 
respect like another.  [3] That which makes good so various is truth; for when truth is conjoined with good it qualifies it. The reason why truth is so manifold and various that it can so greatly vary 
good, is that truths are countless, and interior truths are in a different form from exterior truths, and because the fallacies which are of the external senses adjoin themselves, and also falsities 
which are of concupiscences. Seeing then that truths are so countless, it can be seen that by means of the conjunctions so many varieties arise that one thing can never be the same as another. This is 
clear to him who knows that from only twenty-three letters, put together in different ways, there can arise the words of all languages, and even with a perpetual variety if there were thousands of languages. 
What then may not arise from thousands and myriads of various things such us truths. And this is confirmed by the common maxim, "many men, many minds," that is, there are as many diversities 
of ideas as there are men. </p>

'According to their armies' means in accordance with the genera and species of good within truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'an army' as the truths that constitute faith, dealt with in <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>. 
But forms of good in the spiritual Church are essentially nothing other than truths, since truths are called forms of good when people lead their lives in accordance with those truths. When therefore 
the word 'army' is used to refer to those within the spiritual Church who have been regenerated, forms of the good of truth or forms of good within truths are meant. The reason why it says that the children 
of Israel were to be led out 'according to their armies' is that it is speaking about the time when they will come out of Egypt - in the internal sense when they will come out of conflicts with 
falsities, thus after they have performed spiritual military service. The proper way to understand the command that they were to be led out according to their armies' is that they were to be distinguished 
in keeping with forms of good within truths, thus were to be divided into groups according to different kinds of good. And this was done in order that they might represent the Lord's kingdom in 
the heavens. There all have been divided up and allotted a place in the Grand Man in accordance with both the genus and the species of each one's good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that all in heaven are divided 
up in accordance with their different kinds of good shows how manifold and how varied good is; it is so varied that good is never the same with one person as it is with another. Indeed if millions of 
people went on being multiplied forever, one person's good would still not be like another's, just as one person's face is not like another's; and in heaven furthermore good is what shapes angels' faces. 
The reason for the unending variety is that every form has distinct and varied constituent parts; for if two were exactly alike they could not be two but a single unit. This also explains why in the 
natural order no one thing ever exists which is like another in every respect.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What makes good so varied is truth; when this is joined to good it gives the good specific character. One reason 
why truth is so manifold and varied that it can make good so greatly varied is that truths are countless, and interior truths take on a different form from exterior ones. Another reason is that false 
impressions gained by the outward senses attach themselves, and also false ideas that are products of evil desires. Since therefore truths are so countless one can see that when they are joined to 
good just as many variations are produced, so many that one form of good can never be the same as another. This is plain to anyone who knows that from merely twenty-three letters joined together in different 
combinations the words contained in all languages can be produced; indeed even if there were thousands of languages, an unending variety of combinations could be produced. So what will be the 
product of varieties numbering thousands and millions, as truths do? Confirmation of the existence of those varieties is also contained in the proverb in general use in the world that there are as many 
opinions as there are heads, that is, ideas are as varied as the number of people there are.  </p>

`Juxta exercitus illorum':  quod significet secundum genera et species boni in veris, constat ex significatione `exercitus' quod sint vera quae fidei, de qua n. 3448; {1}bona autem Ecclesiae spiritualis 
sunt {2}in sua essentia non aliud quam vera, {3}haec enim dicuntur bona cum {4}vivitur secundum ea; hinc per `exercitum' cum dicitur de regeneratis intra Ecclesiam spiritualem, (x)significantur bona 
veri, seu {5}bona in veris.  Quod dicatur quod `filii Israelis educendi sint juxta exercitus illorum' est quia dicitur de illis quando exibunt Aegypto, in sensu interno quando ex pugnis cum falsis 
venient, ita postquam militiam spiritualem exercuerunt; proprie {6} intelligitur per quod `educendi juxta exercitus,' quod distinguendi quoad bona in veris, ita in classes secundum qualia boni, et hoc 
ob causam ut {7}repraesentarent regnum Domini in caelis; ibi omnes distincti sunt et locum in Maximo Homine sortiti sunt secundum quale boni tam in genere quam in specie. 	2 Ex caelis quod distincti 
sint omnes ibi secundum bona, constare potest quam multiplex et quam varium {8}est bonum, est enim tam varium ut nusquam unus in simili bono sit in quo alter; immo si myriades myriadum multiplicarentur 
in aeternum, non foret unius bonum simile alterius; sicut nec unus simili facie ac alter; etiam bonum in caelis format facies angelorum; quod perpetua varietas sit, est quia omnis forma ex distinctis 
variis consistit, si enim duo prorsus similes essent, tunc non potuissent duo esse sed unum; inde quoque est quod in natura nusquam detur unum omni modo simile alteri. 	3 Quod facit bonum tam varium 
est {9} verum, hoc cum conjungitur qualificat bonum; quod verum tam multiplex sit et varium ut in tantum variare queat bonum, est quia innumerabilia vera sunt, et in alia forma vera interiora quam 
exteriora, et quod fallaciae quae sensuum externorum (t)se adjungant, et quoque falsa quae sunt concupiscentiarum; cum itaque tam innumerabilia vera sunt, constare potest quod per conjunctiones totidem 
varia existant ut nusquam possit unum cum altero idem esse; hoc liquet ei qui novit quod modo ex viginti tribus variis per diversas conjunctiones existere possint voces omnium linguarum, immo cum perpetua 
varietate si {10} milia linguarum forent, quid non ex milibus (c)ac myriadibus variorum ut sunt vera; hoc quoque {11}confirmat regula communis in mundo, quod tot sensus sint quot capita, hoc est, 
quod tot diversitates idearum quot homines. 	@1 sed vera$ 	@2 bona veri quae non aliud in sua essentia sunt$ 	@3 quae$ 	@4 secundum illa vivitur$ 	@5 bonum$ 	@6 i autem$ 	@7 repraesentetur$ 	@8
