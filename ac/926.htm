<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第926节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>926.</strong>从下文清楚可知，“耶和华就心里说”表这事再也不会发生。当动词“说”用于耶和华时，它无非表示“是如此”或“不是如此”，抑或“发生”或“不发生”，因为只有动词“是（Is）”才能用于耶和华。整个圣言中，凡论及耶和华之物都如此来表述，这是为了那些若不藉着实际经验就无法理解任何事物之人，字义因此具有这种性质。心思简单的人可通过诸如属于人的实际经验之类的表象接受指教，因为他们的认知几乎无法越过基于感官经验之物。所以，是人们的领悟力决定了圣言的言说形式，如此处的情形，经上说“耶和华就心里说”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]926.</strong> The meaning of Jehovah said in his heart as the fact that it would no longer happen this way will be seen from what follows.<br />When Jehovah is spoken of as saying, it means only that a thing happens or does not happen in this way (or that it is to happen or not to happen in this way). After all, nothing else can be said about Jehovah than "He is."{*1} Actions or traits that passages in the Word often attribute to Jehovah are mentioned for the sake of those whose minds cannot grasp anything beyond ordinary human experience. That is why the literal sense has the nature that it does. The simple at heart can learn from the appearances with which we all live. They hardly venture beyond what their senses reveal to them, so the Word speaks at their level of understanding. Such is the case here with the statement that Jehovah said something in his heart.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This statement echoes <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_926/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_14" target=_top>Exodus 3:14</a>, in which Jehovah declares, "I am who I am." See also note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_926/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_630" target=_top>630</a>. [LHC] </p>

Jehovah said in His heart. That this signifies that it would happen so no more, is evident from what follows. When it is predicated of Jehovah that He "says" nothing else is meant than that what He says 
is or takes place so, or not so, for of Jehovah nothing else can be said than that He is. Whatever is predicated of Jehovah in various places in the Word, is so expressed for the sake of those who 
can apprehend nothing except from such things as are in man, and therefore the sense of the letter is of this nature. The simple in heart may be instructed from the appearances with man, for they scarcely 
go beyond the knowledges that are derived from things of sense, and therefore the language of the Word is adapted to their apprehension; as here, where it is said that "Jehovah said in His heart." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 926</b></p><p><b>926.</b>
It is clear from what follows that 'Jehovah said in His heart' means that it would never happen again. When the verb 'says' is used of Jehovah, nothing else is meant than 'is so' or 'is not so', or 'happens' 
or 'does not happen'; for no other verb can be used of Jehovah than Is. The things which are said of Jehovah throughout the Word are there for the benefit of people who cannot grasp anything 
apart from that which comes within man's actual experience. That is why the sense of the letter takes the form it does. The simple in heart are able to be taught from appearances as they belong to man's 
actual experience, for their knowledge of things goes scarcely any further than that based on sensory experience; therefore it is their mental grasp of things that determines the way anything is said 
in the Word, as is the case here with the statement 'Jehovah said in His heart'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 926</b>
</p><b>926.</b>
Quod 'dixit Jehovah in corde Suo' significet quod ita non amplius fieret, ex sequentibus constat: quando de Jehovah praedicatur quod 'dicat,' non aliud est quam quod ita vel non ita sit aut fiat, nam 
de Jehovah nihil aliud dici potest quam Est: quae in Verbo passim praedicantur de Jehovah, pro iis sunt qui nihil capere possunt nisi ex talibus quae apud hominem, quare sensus litterae talis est; simplices 
corde ex apparentiis apud hominem instrui possunt, nam ultra cognitiones ex sensualibus vix vadunt, quare secundum captum eorum locutum est in Verbo; ita hic quod 'Jehovah dixit in corde Suo.' </p>
