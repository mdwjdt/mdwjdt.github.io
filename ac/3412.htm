<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3412节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3412.</strong>“在他父亲亚伯拉罕的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的井，非利士人全都塞住”表拥有认知的记忆知识之人不愿知道出自神性的内层真理，因而抹掉了它们。这从“井”和“塞住”的含义，以及“非利士人”的代表清楚可知：“井”是指真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3096.htm">3096</a>节），在此是指出自神性的内层真理，因为经上说这表示真理的井是“在他父亲亚伯拉罕的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的”，而亚伯拉罕代表主的神性本身（<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>，<a href="3251.htm">3251</a>，<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节）；“塞住”是指不愿知道，因而是指抹掉；“非利士人”是指那些只拥有认知的记忆知识之人（<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>节）。<br />现在论述的主题是属于较低层级的真理表象，它们存在于那些拥有认知的记忆知识之人，也就是此处“非利士人”所表示的人身上。至于出自神性、被那些所谓的“非利士人”抹掉的内层真理，情况是这样：在古教会和古教会之后，那些很少考虑生活，却大量思想教义，并且随着时间推移，甚至拒绝接受生活事务，而是承认信的事务（这信脱离生活）为教会的本质要素之人就被称为“非利士人”。结果，他们根本不重视仁之教义，从而抹掉了它们，而在古教会，仁之教义是教义的全部和主旨。相反，他们过分夸耀信之教义，将其整个宗教都集中于这些教义。他们就这样背离仁爱的生活，也就是背离作为生活之全部和主旨的仁爱，故比起其他所有人，他们更是被称为“未受割礼的”。因为“未受割礼的”是指所有没有仁爱的人，无论他们多么精通教义（<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>节）。<br />那些背离仁爱的人也远离智慧和聪明，因为若没有良善，即仁爱，没有人能在真理方面变得智慧、聪明。事实上，一切真理皆源于良善，并关注良善，以致人若没有良善，就不可能理解真理，甚至不愿知道它。在来世，这种人远离天堂；有时他们身上的光看似亮白如雪，但这光就像冬天里的光，缺乏温暖，产不出果实。这也解释了为何这种人一接近天堂，他们的光就转化为纯粹的黑暗，其心智变成类似那黑暗的东西，也就是愚蠢。由此可见，“只拥有认知的记忆知识之人不愿知道出自神性的内层真理，因而抹掉了它们”这句话是什么意思。</p>

And all the wells that his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them up. That this signifies that they who were in the memory-knowledge of knowledges were 
not willing to know interior truths which are from the Divine, and thus obliterated them, is evident from the signification of "wells," as being truths (n. 2702, 3096), here, interior truths which 
are from the Divine, inasmuch as the wells by which truths are signified are said to have been digged by his father's servants in the days of Abraham his father, for by Abraham is represented the Lord's 
Divine Itself (n. 2011, 2833, 2836, 3251, 3305); from the signification of "stopping up," as being not to be willing to know, and thus to obliterate; and from the representation of the Philistines, 
as being those who are solely in the memory-knowledges of knowledges (n. 1197, 1198). [2] Appearances of truth of a lower degree are now treated of, in which they may be who are in the memory-knowledge 
of knowledges, and who are here meant by the "Philistines." With interior truths which are from the Divine, and which are obliterated by those who are called "Philistines," the case is this: In the 
Ancient Church and afterwards, those were called "Philistines" who applied themselves little to life, but much to doctrine, and who in process of time even rejected the things which are of life, and 
acknowledged as the essential of the church the things which are of faith, which they separated from life; consequently who made light of the doctrinal things of charity, which in the Ancient Church 
were the sum and substance of doctrine, and thus obliterated them, and instead thereof vaunted much the doctrinal things of faith, and made the whole of religion to consist in these; and inasmuch as thereby 
they departed from the life which is of charity-that is, from the charity which is of life-they preeminently were called the "uncircumcised;" for by the "uncircumcised" were signified all who were 
not in charity, however much they might be in doctrinal things (n. 2049). [3] Those who thus departed from charity removed themselves also from wisdom and intelligence; for no one can be wise and 
intelligent in regard to truth unless he is in good, that is, in charity, because all truth is from good, and looks to good; so that they who are without good cannot understand truth, and are not even 
willing to know it. In the other life, when such persons are far from heaven, there sometimes appears with them a snowy light; but this light is like that of winter, which being devoid of heat produces 
no fruit; and therefore when such persons draw near to heaven their light is turned into mere darkness, and their minds are plunged into the like, that is, into stupor. From all this it can now be 
seen what is meant by the statement that those who are in the mere memory-knowledge of knowledges were not willing to know interior truths which are from the Divine, and thus obliterated them. </p>

'All the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them up' means that people who possessed knowledge of cognitions did not wish to know interior 
truths that came from the Divine and so effaced them. This is clear from the meaning of 'wells' as truths, dealt with in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3096.htm">3096</a>, here interior truths coming from the Divine since the wells, 
which mean truths, are said to have been dug by 'his father's servants in the days of Abraham his father' - 'Abraham' representing the Lord's Divine itself, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>, <a href="3251.htm">3251</a>, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a> (end); from the 
meaning of 'stopping up' as not wishing to know and so effacing; and from the representation of 'the Philistines' as people who possess no more than a knowledge of cognitions, dealt with in <a href="1197.htm">1197</a>, <a href="1198.htm">1198</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The subject at this point is the appearances of truth that belong to the lower degree, which are able to exist with those who possess a knowledge of cognitions and whom 'the Philistines' are 
used to mean here. With regard to the interior truths that come from the Divine and are effaced by those called the Philistines, the position is that in the Ancient Church and after it the name Philistines 
was used for those who gave little thought to life and very much to doctrine, and who in course of time even rejected matters of life and acknowledged matters of faith - which faith was separated 
from life - as being the essential element of the Church. As a consequence they attached no importance at all to matters of doctrine concerning charity which in the Ancient Church constituted the 
all of doctrine, and so they effaced it. Instead they proclaimed matters of doctrine concerning faith and centred the whole of their religion in these. And since in this way they departed from the life 
of charity, that is, from charity as the sum and substance of life, they more than all others were called 'the uncircumcised'. For by 'the uncircumcised' were meant all in whom charity was not present, 
no matter how much doctrine they knew, <a href="2049.htm">2049</a> (end). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because such people departed from charity they also removed themselves from wisdom and intelligence, for no one can have a wise and intelligent 
discernment of what truth is unless good, that is, charity, reigns in him. Indeed all truth originates in good and has regard to good, so that anyone who is devoid of good is unable to have an intelligent 
discernment of truth, and does not even wish to know it When such people in the next life are far away from heaven, light bright as snow is sometimes seen to be with them. But that light is 
like the light in wintertime which, being devoid of warmth, is unproductive. This also explains why, when such persons draw near to heaven, their light is converted into utter darkness, and their minds 
into something akin to that darkness, which is stupidity. From these considerations it may now be seen what is meant by the statement that people who possessed no more than a knowledge of cognitions 
did not wish to know interior truths that came from the Divine and so effaced them. </p>

`Omnes puteos, quos foderunt servi patris ejus in diebus Abrahami patris ejus, obturabant illos Philistaei': quod significet quod illi qui in scientia cognitionum, vera interiora quae a Divino non scire 
vellent, sic obliterarent, constat ex significatione `puteorum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 2702, 3096, hic vera interiora quae a Divino, quia putei, per quos vera significantur, effossi dicuntur `a 
servis patris ejus in diebus Abrahami patris ejus', per `Abrahamum' enim repraesentatur ipsum Divinum Domini, n. 2011, 2833, 2836, 3251, 3305 f.; ex significatione `obturare' quod sit non scire velle, 
et {1}sic obliterare; et ex repraesentatione `Philistaeorum' quod sint illi qui in sola scientia cognitionum, de qua n. 1197, 1198. [2] Agitur nunc de veri apparentiis inferioris gradus, in quibus 
esse possunt illi qui in scientia cognitionum sunt, et hic per `Philistaeos' intelliguntur. Cum veris interioribus quae a Divino, et obliterantur ab illis qui Philistaei vocantur, ita se habet: in Antiqua 
Ecclesia et postea, Philistaei dicti fuerunt qui parum vitae studuerunt, sed plurimum doctrinae, et successu temporis etiam rejecerunt illa quae vitae sunt, et pro essentiali Ecclesiae agnorunt illa 
quae fidei, quam a vita separarunt; consequenter qui doctrinalia charitatis quae in Antiqua Ecclesia omne doctrinae erant, nihili fecerunt, ac ita obliterabant, at doctrinalia fidei loco (c)eorum 
venditarunt, et in his omne religiosum posuerunt; et quia recesserunt ita a vita quae est charitatis, seu a charitate quae est vitae, dicti sunt prae aliis praeputiati; per `praeputiatos' enim significabantur 
omnes qui non in charitate fuerunt, utcumque in doctrinalibus {2}, n. 2049 f.; tales {3}qui recesserunt a charitate, etiam a sapientia et intelligentia se removerunt; [3] nemo enim sapere et 
intelligere {4}potest quid verum, nisi in bono sit, hoc est, in charitate, omne enim verum est ex bono et spectat bonum; ita qui absque {5}bono, verum non intelligere possunt, et ne quidem scire volunt: 
apud tales in altera vita, cum {6}procul sunt a caelo, quandoque apparet nivea lux, sed lux illa est qualis lux hiemalis, quae quia absque calore, nihil fructificat; quare etiam cum tales ad caelum 
approximant, lux illorum vertitur in meras tenebras, et mens eorum in similes, hoc est, in stuporem: ex his nunc constare potest quid sit, quod illi qui in sola scientia cognitionum, vera interiora quae 
a Divino, non scire vellent, et sic obliterarent. @1 ideo$  @2 i erant$  @3 quia$  @4 before et$  @5 illo sunt$  @6 eminus$  </p>
