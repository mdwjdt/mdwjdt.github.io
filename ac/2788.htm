<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2788节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2788.</strong>“到了第三日”表结束，以及圣化的开始。这从“第三日”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“日”表状态（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节），“年”，以及总体上的一切时间段也是如此。如一小时，一天，一周，一月，一年或一个世纪；再如早晨、中午、傍晚和夜间；或春、夏、秋、冬。当这些时间段加上“第三”时，它们表示这个状态的结束，同时表示下一个状态的开始。由于此处论述的主题是主藉着试探所实现的圣化，故“第三日”表结束，同时表圣化的开始，这一点从此前论述也可推知。具有这种含义的原因在于，当主应验一切事时，祂要在第三日复活。因为主在世时已成就，或要成就的事都体现在教会的代表物中，仿佛早就成就了。这就跟圣言的内义一样，因为在神里面，尚未实现的事和已实现的事都是一回事，事实上，对祂来说，整个永恒就在此处，就在当下。<br />因此，数字“三”是不仅在古教会和犹太教中是代表物，而且在各个外邦民族中也是代表物。关于这个数字的论述，可参看前文（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>，<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>节）。这就是“三”的原义，这一点清楚可见于何西阿书：<br />来吧，我们归向耶和华！祂撕裂，也必医治我们；祂打伤我们，也必缠裹。过两天祂必使我们苏醒，第三天祂必使我们兴起，我们就在他面前得以存活。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“第三天”表主的到来和祂的复活。这一点同样从约拿清楚看出来，他在鱼腹中三日三夜（约拿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿1.17.htm">1:17</a>）；对此，主在马太福音如此说：<br />约拿三日三夜在鲸腹中，人子也要这样三日三夜在地心里。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.40.htm">12:40</a>）<br />要知道，就圣言的内义而言，“三日”和“第三日”意思是一样的，如以下经文的“三”和“第三”，约翰福音：<br />耶稣对犹太人说，你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来。祂所说的圣殿是指祂的身体。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.61.htm">26:61</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.58.htm">14:58</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.29.htm">15:29</a>）<br />众所周知，主在第三日复活。由于同样的原因，主将祂的生命分为三个时期，如路加福音所述：<br />你们去告诉那个狐狸，你看吧，今天、明天我赶鬼治病，第三天我就完了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.32.htm">13:32</a>）<br />主在那一天的巳初（即上午第三时）经受祂的最后试探，也就是十字架受难（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.25.htm">15:25</a>）；三小时后，或约有午正（第六时），遍地都黑暗了（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路23.44.htm">23:44</a>）；三小时后，或申初的时候（第九时），气就断了（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.33.htm">15:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.34.htm">34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.37.htm">37</a>）。但在“第三日”早晨，祂复活了（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.1.htm">16:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.4.htm">4</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.7.htm">24:7</a>；也可参看马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.21.htm">16:21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.22.htm">17:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.18.htm">20:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.19.htm">19</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.31.htm">8:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.31.htm">9:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.33.htm">10:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.34.htm">34</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.33.htm">18:33</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.46.htm">24:46</a>）。综上所述，尤其从主第三日复活清楚可知，数字三具有代表性和灵义。这一事实从以下圣言经文可以看出来：<br />当耶和华降临西乃山时，祂吩咐摩西叫百姓今天明天自洁，又叫他们洗衣服。到第三天要预备好了，因为第三天耶和华要降临。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.10.htm">19:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.16.htm">16</a>）<br />以色列人离开耶和华的山，往前行了三天的路程；耶和华的约柜在他们前头行了三天的路程，为他们寻找安歇的地方。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.33.htm">10:33</a>）<br />埃及遍地就乌黑了三天。三天之久，他们彼此看不见，惟有以色列人有亮光。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.22.htm">10:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.23.htm">23</a>）<br />还愿祭或甘心祭的肉要在第一天和第二天吃完；一点也不可留到第三天，但所剩下的祭肉要用火焚烧，因为它是可憎嫌的。平安祭的肉也是如此：<br />第三天若吃了平安祭的肉，这祭必不蒙悦纳，但灵魂必担当它的罪孽。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.16.htm">7:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.6.htm">19:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.7.htm">7</a>）<br />摸了人死尸的，到第三天要洁净自己，第七天就洁净了；否则，灵魂必从以色列中剪除，第三天和第七天，洁净的人要洒水在不洁净的人身上。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.12.htm">19:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.19.htm">19</a>）<br />凡杀了人的，和一切摸了被杀的，第三日、第七日，都要洁净自己。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.19.htm">31:19</a>）<br />他们到了迦南地，三年之久，要以它的果子为未受割礼，是不可吃的。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.23.htm">19:23</a>）<br />每三年之末，他们要将本年的土产十分之一都取出来，积存在他们的城门内，利未人，寄居的，并孤儿寡妇，都可以吃。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申14.28.htm">14:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申14.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申24.12.htm">24:12</a>）<br />一年三次，他们要向耶和华守节，一切的男丁要一年三次朝见主耶和华的面。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.14.htm">23:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.17.htm">17</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.16.htm">16:16</a>）<br />约书亚吩咐百姓，三日之内，他们要过这约旦河，得这地为业。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书1.11.htm">1:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.2.htm">3:2</a>）<br />耶和华三次呼唤撒母耳，撒母耳在第三次应答。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上3.8.htm">3:8</a>）<br />扫罗想杀大卫，大卫藏在田野，直到第三日晚上。约拿单对大卫说，他要在第三日探他父亲的意思。约拿单要向磐石旁边射三箭，然后大卫在约拿单面前俯伏在地，拜了三拜。 （撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.5.htm">20:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.19.htm">19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.20.htm">20</a>，<a

href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.12.htm">24:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.13.htm">13</a>）<br />大卫在位的日子有饥荒，一连三年。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下21.1.htm">21:1</a>）<br />以利亚三次伏在死去孩子的身上，并将生命归回给他。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上17.21.htm">17:21</a>）<br />以利亚给耶和华筑坛时，吩咐他们在燔祭和柴上倒三次水。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.34.htm">18:34</a>）<br />王第三次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去。这五十夫长上去，双膝跪在以利亚面前，哀求他说：“神人哪，愿我的性命和你这五十个仆人的性命在你眼前看为宝贵。<br />有火给以利亚降下来，烧灭五十夫长，但第三次没有给他降下来。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下1.13.htm">1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />赐给希西家王一个证据：第一年他们要吃自生的，第二年也要吃自长的；第三年，他们要耕种收割，栽植葡萄园，吃它们的果子。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下19.29.htm">19:29</a>）<br />但以理就到自己家里，打开他寝室开向耶路撒冷的窗户，在此一日三次双膝跪着，祷告感谢。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但6.10.htm">6:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />但以理悲伤了三个七日。没有吃美食，没有喝酒，也没有用油抹他自己，直到满了三个七日。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.2.htm">10:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以赛亚书露身赤脚行走三年，作为关乎埃及和古实的预兆奇迹。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛20.3.htm">20:3</a>）<br />灯台每一边要杈出三个枝子，每枝上有三个杯，形状像杏花。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.32.htm">25:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.33.htm">33</a>）<br />在乌陵和土明中，每行有三块宝石。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.17.htm">28:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.20.htm">20</a>）<br />新殿有卫房，这旁三间，那旁三间，它们三间都是一样的尺寸；在殿前的廊子，门两旁，这边三肘，那边三肘。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.10.htm">40:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.48.htm">48</a>）<br />新耶路撒冷北面有三门，东面有三门，南面有三门，西面有三门。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.31.htm">48:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.34.htm">34</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.13.htm">21:13</a>）<br />这一点同样可见于以下经文：<br />彼得三次不认耶稣。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.34.htm">26:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.69.htm">69</a>等）<br />主三次对彼得说：“你爱我吗？” （约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.17.htm">21:17</a>）<br />还有这个比喻：<br />栽葡萄园的人三次打发仆人去，最后打发他的儿子去。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.12.htm">20:12</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.2.htm">12:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.4.htm">4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.6.htm">6</a>）<br />在葡萄园作工的人是在第三、第六、第九和第十一个时辰被雇来的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.1.htm">20:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.17.htm">17</a>）<br />无花果树因三年不结果，就要被砍掉。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.6.htm">13:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.7.htm">7</a>）<br />由于三一体和三分之一都具有代表性，故三分之一部分也具有代表性。如：<br />细面伊法十分之二，并油一欣三分之一，调和作素祭。又用酒一欣三分之一作奠祭。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.6.htm">15:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.7.htm">7</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.14.htm">46:14</a>）<br />先知以西结用这刀剃头和胡须，然后将须发平分，围困城的日子满了，将三分之一用火焚烧，将三分之一用刀砍碎，将三分之一任风吹散。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这全地的人，三分之二必剪除，三分之一仍必存留；这三分之一要经火熬炼。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.8.htm">13:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.9.htm">9</a>）<br />第一位天使吹号，就有雹子与火搀着血丢在地上，树的三分之一被烧了。第二位天使吹号，就有仿佛火烧着的大山扔在海中，海的三分之一变成血；海中有性命（souls）的生物死了三分之一，船只也坏了三分之一。第三位天使吹号，就有烧着的大星好像火把从天上落下来，落在江河的三分之一；这星名叫“茵陈”。第四位天使吹号，日头的三分之一，月亮的三分之一，星辰的三分之一都被击打，以致日月星的三分之一黑暗了，白昼的三分之一没有光，黑夜也是这样。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.7.htm">8:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.12.htm">12</a>）<br />那四个要杀人的三分之一的使者被释放。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.15.htm">9:15</a>）<br />马口中所出来的火与烟，并硫磺，这三样杀了人的三分之一。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.18.htm">9:18</a>）<br />龙的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一，摔在地上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.4.htm">12:4</a>）<br />然而，“第三部分”（A third part）表某种尚未终结的事，而“三分之一”（a third）和“三一体”（a trine）表已终结的事，对恶者来说是恶事，对善者来说是善事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2788</b></p><p><b>2788.</b>
On the third day. That this signifies completeness, and the beginning of sanctification, is evident from the signification of the "third day." "Day" in the Word signifies state (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 
893); as also does "year," and in general all periods of time; as an "hour," a "day," a "week," a "month," a "year," an "age;" as also "morning," "noon," "evening," and "night;" and "spring," "summer," 
"autumn," and "winter;" and when "third" is added to these, they signify the end of that state, and at the same time the beginning of the following state. As the Lord's sanctification is here treated 
of, which was effected by temptations, the "third day" signifies completeness, and at the same time the beginning of sanctification, as also follows from what has been already said. The reason of this 
signification is that when the Lord had fulfilled all things He would rise again on the third day; for the things that were done, or that would be done by the Lord when He lived in the world, were 
in the representatives of the church as if already done (as also they were in the internal sense of the Word); for in God to be and to become are the same; indeed all eternity is present to Him.  [2] 
Hence the number "three" was representative, not only in the Ancient Church and in the Jewish, but also among various nations. (See what is said concerning this number above, n. 720, 901, 1825.) That 
this was the origin of the signification of "three," is evident in Hosea: </p>
<p>     Let us return unto Jehovah, for He hath wounded, and He will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up; after two 
days He will revive us, on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live before Him (Hos. 6:1-2); </p>
<p>where the "third day" denotes the Lord's coming, and His resurrection. And from Jonah, that 
he "was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights" (Jonah 1:17); concerning which the Lord thus speaks in Matthew: </p>
<p>     As Jonah was in the whale's belly three days and three nights, so shall 
the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40). [3] Be it known that in the internal sense of the Word "three days" and the "third day" signify the same, as 
also do "three" and "third" in the passages which now follow. In John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to the Jews, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spake of the temple of His body (John 
2:19-21; Matt. 26:61; Mark 14:58; 15:29). [4] That the Lord rose again on the third day is known. For the same reason the Lord distinguished the periods of His life into three, as stated in Luke: </p>
<p> 
    Go ye and tell that fox, Behold I cast out demons, and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am perfected (Luke 13:32). His last temptation also, that of the cross, the Lord endured 
at the "third hour" of the day (Mark 15:25); and after three hours there came darkness over the whole land, or at the "sixth hour" (Luke 23:44); and after three hours, or at the "ninth hour," the 
end (Mark 15:33-34, 37). But on the morning of the "third day" He rose again (Mark 16:1-4; Luke 24:7); (see Matt. 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; Mark 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34; Luke 18:33; 24:46). From all this, 
and especially from the Lord's resurrection on the third day, the number "three" was representative and significative, as may be seen from the following passages in the Word: </p>
<p>     When Jehovah came 
down upon Mount Sinai, He told Moses to sanctify the people today and tomorrow, and that they should wash their garments, and be ready against the third day, for on the third day Jehovah would descend 
(Exod. 19:10-11, 15-16).      When they set forth from the mount of Jehovah on a journey of three days, the ark of Jehovah went before them a three days' journey to seek out a resting place for them 
(Num. 10:33).      There was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days, and they saw not one another for three days, but the sons of Israel had light (Exod. 10:22-23). [5] The flesh of the 
sacrifice of a vow, or of a freewill-offering, was to be eaten on the first and second day; nothing was to be left to the third day, but the remainder was to be burnt, because it was an abomination.  
    So too with the flesh of the peace-offering; and if it should be eaten on the third day it would not propitiate, but the soul should carry its iniquity (Lev. 7:16-18; 19:6-7).      He that touched 
one dead was to purify himself on the third day, and on the seventh day he should be clean; otherwise that soul should be cut off from Israel and one that was clean should sprinkle water upon him 
that was unclean on the third day and on the seventh day (Num. 19:12-13, 19).      They who slew a person in battle, or touched one that was slain, were to purify themselves on the third day, and on 
the seventh day (Num. 31:19). [6] When they came into the land of Canaan the fruit was to be uncircumcised three years, and was not to be eaten (Lev. 19:23).      At the end of three years they were 
to bring all the tithes of their increase in that year and lay it up in their gates, that the Levite, the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow might eat (Deut. 14:28-29; 24:12).      Three times in 
the year they were to keep a feast to Jehovah, and three times in the year every male was to appear before the face of the Lord Jehovih (Exod. 23:14, 17; Deut. 16:16).      Joshua told the people that 
in three days they should pass over the Jordan and inherit the land (Josh. 1:11; 3:2). [7] Jehovah called to Samuel three times, and he answered the third time (1 Sam. 3:8).      When Saul wished 
to kill David, David hid himself in the field till the third evening. Jonathan said to David that he would sound his father on the third day. Jonathan shot three arrows by the side of the stone, and 
David then fell upon his face to the earth before Jonathan and bowed himself down three times (1 Sam. 20:5, 12, 19-20, 30, 36, 41).    David was to choose one of three things: seven years of famine 
in the land; or that he should flee before his enemies three months; or a pestilence in the land three days (2 Sam. 24:12-13). [8] There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year 
(2 Sam. 21:1).      Elijah stretched himself upon the dead child three times and brought him to life (1 Kings 17:21).      When Elijah had built the altar to Jehovah, he told them to pour water upon 
the burnt offering and upon the wood three times (1 Kings 18:34).      The fire twice consumed the commanders over fifty, sent to Elijah, but not him that was sent the third time (2 Kings 1:13).  
    It was a sign to king Hezekiah that they should eat that year what sprung up spontaneously, in the second year the aftergrowth, but in the third year they should sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat 
the fruit of them (2 Kings 19:29). [9] Daniel entered into his house and had the windows open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, and here three times a day he blessed upon his knees and prayed (Dan. 
6:11, 14).      Daniel mourned three weeks of days, eating no pleasant bread, nor drinking wine, nor anointing himself, until the three weeks of days were fulfilled (Dan. 10:2-3).      Isaiah went naked 
and barefoot three years, for a sign and a wonder upon Egypt and upon Cush (Isa. 20:3).      Out of the candlestick went forth three branches on each side, and three almond-shaped cups on each branch 
(Exod. 25:32-33).      In the Urim and Thummim there were three precious stones in each row (Exod. 28:17-19). [10] In the new temple there were to be three chambers of the gate on this side and 
three on that side, and they three should have one measure; at the porch of the house the breadth of the gate should be three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side (Ezek. 40:10, 21, 48).  
    In the new Jerusalem there were to be three gates to the north, three to the east, three to the south, and three to the west (Ezek. 48:31-34; Rev. 21:13). So in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Peter 
denied Jesus thrice (Matt. 26:34, 69 and following verses).      The Lord said to Peter three times, "Lovest thou Me?" (John 21:17).      Also in the parable, the man who planted the vineyard sent 
servants three times, and at length his son (Luke 20:12; Mark 12:2, 4-6).      They who labored in the vineyard were hired at the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour, and the eleventh hour 
(Matt. 20:1-17).      Because the fig tree did not bear fruit for three years, it was to be cut down (Luke 13:6, 7). [11] As a trine and a third were representative, so also was a third part; as that 
in the meat offering of fine flour two tenths were mixed with a third part of a hin of oil and the wine for a libation was a third part of a hin (Num. 15:6, 7; Ezek. 46:14).      The prophet Ezekiel 
was to pass a razor upon his head, and upon his beard, and then divide the hair and burn a third part in the fire, and smite a third with the sword, about it [the city], and scatter a third to the 
wind (Ezek. 5:1-2, 11).      In the whole land, two parts were to be cut off and the third was to be left; but the third was to be brought through the fire and proved (Zech. 13:8-9). [12] When the first 
angel sounded there came hail and fire mingled with blood, and it fell upon the earth so that a third part of the trees were burnt up. The second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning 
with fire was cast into the sea, and a third part of the sea became blood; because of which a third part of the creatures in the sea having souls, died, and a third part of the ships were destroyed. 
The third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven burning like a lamp, and it fell upon a third part of the rivers; the name of the star was Wormwood. The fourth angel sounded, and 
a third part of the sun was smitten, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night 
in like manner (Rev. 8:7-12).      [13] The four angels were loosed to kill a third part of men (Rev. 9:15).      By these three were the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and 
the brimstone, which proceeded out of the mouth of the horses (Rev. 9:18).      The dragon drew with his tail a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth (Rev. 12:4). A "third part," 
however, signifies some, and what is not yet complete; but the "third," and a "trine," what is complete; and this, of evil to the evil, and of good to the good. </p>

That 'on the third day' means that which has been completed, and the beginning of sanctification, is clear from the meaning of 'the third day'. 'Day' in the Word means state, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, 
as also does 'year', and as in general do all periods of time - an hour, day, week, month, year, or age; also morning, midday, evening, and night; and spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And when 'the 
third' is added to any of these the end of that state, and at the same time the beginning of the next, are meant. Here, the subject being the sanctification of the Lord which was effected by means of 
temptations, 'the third day' means that which has been completed and at the same time the beginning of sanctification, as also follows from what has been said previously to this. The reason for this 
meaning is that when He had fulfilled everything the Lord was to rise again on the third day, for the things that were done by the Lord while He lived in the world, that is, the things that were yet to 
be done by Him, were embodied within the representatives of the Church as though they had already been done. This was as it is with the internal sense of the Word, for with God that which is yet to 
come to pass and that which already is are one and the same; indeed to Him the whole of eternity is here and now. </p>

 This is why the number three was representative not only in the Ancient Church 
and in the Jewish but also among various gentile nations; see what has been stated about this number in <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>, <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>. That such was the origin of the meaning of 'three' is clear in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
We will 
return to Jehovah, for He has wounded and will heal us; He has stricken and will bind us up; He will revive us after two days, on the third day He will raise us up that we may live before Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%206:-1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 6:-1, 2</a>.

<p>Here 'the third day' stands for the coming of the Lord and His resurrection. The same is clear from Jonah, in that he was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jonah%201:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jonah 1:17</a>, 
to which the Lord refers in Matthew as follows, </p>
<p>As Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

 It should be realized that in the internal sense of the Word 'three days' and 'the third day' have the same meaning, as also do 'three' and 'third' in the following places: In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said to the Jews, Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up. He was speaking of the temple of His body. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%202:%2019-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 2: 19-21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:%2061&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26: 61</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2014:-58;%2015:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 14:-58; 15: 29</a>.

<p>It is a well known

<p><b>[4]</b>
 For the same reason the Lord also distinguished three periods in His life: in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform 
cures today and tomorrow, but on the third day I reach completion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:-32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:-32</a>.

<p>Also, the Lord underwent the final temptation, which was that of the Cross, at the third hour of the day, Mark 
15: <a href="25.htm">25</a>. Three hours later, that is, at the sixth hour, darkness fell over the whole land,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2023:-44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 23:-44</a>.

From all this, and especially from the 
Lord's resurrection on the third day, the number three was representative and possessed a spiritual meaning. This fact becomes clear from the following places in the Word: </p>
<p> When Jehovah came down 
upon Mount Sinai He told Moses that he was to sanctify the people today and tomorrow and they were to wash their garments and be ready on the third day, for on the third day Jehovah would come down. Exod.

 The flesh

non modo in Antiqua Ecclesia et in Judaica, sed etiam apud varias gentes, videantur quae de hoc numero dicta sunt, n. 720, 901, 1825; quod ex illa origine, constat apud Hosheam,      Revertemur {2} 
ad Jehovam, quia ille sauciavit, et sanabit       nos, percussit, et obligabit nos, vivificabit nos a duobus      diebus in die tertio suscitabit nos, ut vivamus coram Ipso, vi      1, 2; </p>
<p>ubi `dies 
tertius' pro Adventu Domini et resurrectione: et a Jona, quod      In visceribus piscis fuerit tres dies, et tres noctes, Jon. ii      1 [A.V. i 17]; </p>
<p>de quibus ita Dominus apud Matthaeum,    
  Quemadmodum fuit Jonas in ventre ceti tribus diebus et tribus      noctibus, sic erit Filius hominis in corde terrae tribus      diebus et tribus noctibus, xii 40. Sciendum est quod in sensu interno 
Verbi `tres dies' [3] idem significent, ut quoque in locis quae sequuntur, tria et tertium: </p>
<p>apud Johannem,      Dixit Jesus Judaeis, Solvite templum hoc, in tribus tamen      diebus exsuscitabo 
illud;... Ipse loquebatur de templo      corporis Sui, ii 19-21; Matth. xxvi 61; Marc. xiv 58; xv 29: </p>
<p>quod Dominus tertio die resurrexerit, notum est: [4] ideo etiam Dominus distinxit tempora vitae 
Suae in Tria, apud Lucam,           Euntes dicite vulpi isti, Ecce ejicio daemonia, et      sanationes perficio hodie et cras, sed tertio die consummor,      xiii 32: </p>
<p>          Etiam ultimam tentationem, 
quae erat crucis, sustinuit       Dominus hora tertia diei, Marc. xv 25; et post tres horas      tenebrae factae sunt super universam terram, seu hora sexta,      Luc. xxiii 44; et post tres 
horas, seu hora nona, finis, Marc.      xv 33, 34, 37; Mane autem tertio die resurrexit, Marc. xvi 1- </p>
<p>     4; Luc. xxiv 7; videatur Matth. xvi 21; xvii 22, 23; xx 18,      19; Marc. ix 31; viii 
31; x 33, 34; Luc. xviii 33; xxiv 46; </p>
<p>inde {3}, et imprimis ex resurrectione Domini die tertio, numerus ternarius repraesentativus et significativus fuit; quod fuerit, constare potest ab his in Verbo 
locis,      Cum Jehovah descenderet super monte Sinai, dixit ad Mosen, ut      sanctificaret populum hodie et cras, et ut lavarent vestes      suas, et essent parati in diem tertium, quia in die 
tertio  descendet Jehovah, Exod. xix 10, 11, 15, 16: </p>
<p>     Cum profecti a monte Jehovae itinere trium dierum, arca      Jehovae proficiscebatur coram iis itinere trium dierum ad      investigandum 
iis requiem, Num. x 33: </p>
<p>praeterea quod           Fuerit caligo in omni terra Aegypti tres dies, et non      viderit vir fratrem suum tres dies, at filiis Israelis fuerit      lux, Exod. x 22, 23; </p>
<p> 
         [5] Quod caro sacrificii votivi et spontanei comederetur      primo et secundo die, nihil relinqueretur ad diem tertium,      sed combureretur,... quia abominatio; </p>
<p>pariter           Caro 
sacrificii Eucharistici, et si comederetur die      tertio, non placaretur, sed anima iniquitatem suam portaret,      Lev. vii 16-18; xix 6, 7: </p>
<p>          Quod tangens mortuum se expiaret die tertio, 
et die      septimo mundus esset; si non, exscinderetur anima illa ex      Israele:... et quod spargeret aquam mundus super immundum die      tertio et die septimo, Num. xix 12, 13, 19: </p>
<p>      
    Qui in proelio occiderunt animam, et tetigerunt      confossum, quod purificarent se die tertio, et die septimo,      Num. xxxi 19: </p>
<p>[6]       Quod fructus, cum venirent in terram Canaanem, tribus  
    annis esset praeputiatus, et non comederetur, Lev. xix 23: </p>
<p>          Quod a fine trium annorum educerent omnes decimas      proventus sui in anno isto, et reponerent in portis, ut      Levita, 
peregrinus, pupillus, et vidua, comederent, Deut. xiv      28, 29; xxvi 12: </p>
<p>          Quod tribus vicibus in anno, feriarentur Jehovae:... et      tribus vicibus in anno compareret omnis masculus 
ante faciem      Domini Jehovae, Exod. xxiii 14, 17: Deut. xvi 16: </p>
<p>          Quod Joshua diceret ad populum, quod in tres dies      transirent Jordanem, et hereditarent terram, Jos. i II; iii 2: </p>
<p> 
         Quod Jehovah clamaverit ad Samuelem tribus vicibus, ille      tertia vice responderet, I Sam. iii 8: </p>
<p>[7]       Cum Saul occidere vellet Davidem, quod David se      occultaret in agro ad 
vesperam tertiam:... Jonathan diceret ad      Davidem, Explorabo patrem meum tempore crastino tertio: </p>
<p>     ...quod Jonathan tres sagittas ad latus lapidis jacularetur: </p>
<p>     ...quodque David coram 
Jonathane tunc ceciderit super faciem      suam ad terram, et incurvaverit se tribus vicibus, I Sam. xx      5, 12, 19, 20, 35, 36, 41: </p>
<p>          Quod David eligeret ex tribus unum; vel septem annos  
    famis in terra; vel tribus mensibus fugeret coram hostibus: </p>
<p>     vel tribus diebus pestem in terra, 2 Sam. xxiv 12, 13: </p>
<p>[8]       Quod fames, diebus Davidis, tribus annis fuerit, anno     
 post annum, 2 Sam. xxi 1: </p>
<p>          Quod Elias se mensus super puero mortuo tribus vicibus et      vivificaverit illum, 11 Reg. xvii 21: </p>
<p>          Elias, cum aedificaverat altare Jehovae, quod diceret,  
    effunderent aquas super holocaustum, et super ligna tribus      vicibus, 1 Reg. xviii 34: </p>
<p>          Quod ignis consumpserit praefectos super quinquaginta      missos ad Eliam binis vicibus, 
non autem missum tertia vice 2      Reg. i 13 [14]: </p>
<p>          Quod esset signum Hizkiae regi, quod comederent eo an      sponte natum, in anno secundo ultro crescens, anno autem      tertio sererent, 
meterent, plantarent vineas, et comederent      fructum eorum, 2 Reg. xix [29]: </p>
<p>[9]       Quod Daniel ingressus domum suam, et fenestrae apertae      illi in cenaculo versus Hierosolymam, 
ubi tribus vicibus in        benediceret super genubus, et oraret, Dan. vi 11, 14 [A.V. 10,      13]: </p>
<p>          Quod  Daniel  lugeret  tribus  septimanis  dierum, panem      desideriorum non comedens, 
nec vinum bibens, nec se ungens,      usque dum implerentur tres septimanae dierum,Dan.2,3: </p>

tres lapides pretiosi in      quovis ordine, Exod. xxviii [17, 18], 19 [20]: </p>
<p>[10]      Quod in Novo Templo erunt thalami portae tres hinc et in      tres illinc, mensura una ternis illis;... ad 
porticum domus      latitudo portae tres ulnae hinc et tres ulnae illinc, Ezech.      xl 10, 21, 48: </p>
<p>          Quod in Nova Hierosolyma erunt tres portae ad      septentrionem, tres ad orientem,

<p>          Quod Dominus 
dixerit Petro {4} tribus vicibus, Amasne      Me?  Joh. xxi 17: </p>

<p>          Et de ficu, quia non ferret fructum per tres 
annos, quod      exscinderetur, Luc. xiii 6, 7. [11] Sicut trinum et tertium erat repraesentativum, etiam erat tertia pars; ut quod {6}      Minhae de similagine duae decimae mixtae essent oleo tertia  
    hinis parte, et vinum in libamen esset tertia hinis, Num. xv      6, 7; Ezech. xlvi 14: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem,      Quod traduceret novaculam super caput suum, et super barbam      suam,... 
et dein divideret crines, et tertiam partem igne      combureret,...tertiam percuteret gladio circum eam, et tertiam      dispergeret in ventum, v 1, 2, 11: </p>

<p>apud Johannem,                                                  [12] 
     Cum clanxit angelus primus, facta est grando, et ignis      mixtus sanguine, et cecidit super tertam, ita {7} ut tertia      pars arborum combusta sit.... Secundus angelus clanxit, et      quasi 
mons magnus igne ardens projectus est in mare; et facta      est tertia pars maris, sanguis, unde mortua tertia pars      creaturarum in mari habentium animas; et tertia pars navium      corrupta 
est. Tertius angelus clanxit, et cecidit e caelo      stella magna ardens sicut lampas, et cecidit super tertiam      partem fluviorum,...nomen stellae absinthium.... Quartus      angelus clanxit, 
ita ut percussa sit tertia pars solis, et      tertia pars lunae, et tertia pars stellarum, ut obtenebraretur      tertia pars earum, et dies non luceret tertia sui parte,      noxque similiter, 
Apoc. viii 7-12: </p>
<p>[13]      Soluti sunt quatuor angeli, ut occiderent tertiam partem      hominum, Apoc. ix 15: </p>

<p>          Draco cauda traxit tertiam partem stellarum caeli, et      projecit in tertam, Apoc. xii 4. Sed `tertia pars' significat aliquid, et nondum 
plenum; at `tertium et {8} trinum' completum, et hoc pro malis malum, et pro bonis bonum.      @1 in caelo ut praesentia fuerunt$      @2 A and I have revertentur but cf. 720$      @3 Inde est, quod
