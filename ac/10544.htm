<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10544节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10544</strong>.出埃及记33:7-11.摩西拿一个帐棚为自己支搭在营外，离营却远，他称这帐棚为会幕，于是，凡求问耶和华的，就到营外的会幕那里去。于是，当摩西出去到会幕那里的时候，众百姓就都起来，各人站在自己帐棚门前，望着摩西，直等到他进了会幕。于是，摩西进会幕的时候，云柱降下来，立在会幕的门口，与摩西交谈。众百姓看见云柱立在会幕门口；众百姓就都起来，各人在自己帐棚的门口下拜。耶和华与摩西面对面说话，好像人与邻舍说话一般。摩西回到营里，惟有他的助手，一个少年人嫩的儿子约书亚，不离开会幕中间。<br />“摩西拿一个帐棚”表敬拜、教会和圣言的神圣之物。“为自己支搭在营外，离营却远”表远离这个民族本身感兴趣的外在事物。“他称这帐棚为会幕”表敬拜、教会和圣言的外在，它含有内在事物在里面。“于是，凡求问耶和华的，就到营外的会幕那里去”表关于教会和敬拜的真理和良善的一切指示都通过圣言的外在意义被赋予每个人，远离这个民族本身唯独感兴趣的外在事物。“于是，当摩西出去到会幕那里的时候，众百姓就都起来，各人站在自己帐棚门前”表这个民族不住在圣言、教会和敬拜的外在中，而是住在这外在之外。“望着摩西，直等到他进了会幕”表他们看见圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，但它超出了他们所能理解的范畴。“于是，摩西进会幕的时候，云柱降下来，立在会幕的门口，与摩西交谈”表当圣言超出了他们所能理解的范畴之后，一种极度的模糊从外面占据了他们，然而却有来自里面的一种清晰觉察。“众百姓看见云柱立在会幕门口”表一种极度的模糊从外面占据他们。“众百姓就都起来，各人在自己帐棚的门口下拜”表这个民族以一种神圣的方式崇拜他们的外在之物。“耶和华与摩西面对面说话”表被结合在一起的圣言中的神性事物。“好像人与邻舍说话一般”表真理和良善的结合。“摩西回到营里”表回到这个民族的兴趣所在的外在之物。“惟有他的助手，一个少年人嫩的儿子约书亚，不离开会幕中间”表在此期间，神性真理在教会和敬拜的圣事上代替摩西服事。</p>

Verses 7-11. And Moses took a tent, and stretched it for himself without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And it was that everyone inquiring of Jehovah went out 
unto the tent of meeting that was outside the camp. And it was that when Moses went out unto the tent, all the people rose up, and stood, every man at the door of his tent, and looked after Moses, until 
he had entered into the tent. And it was that when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and spoke with Moses. And all the people saw the pillar 
of cloud standing at the door of the tent; and all the people rose up and bowed themselves, every man at the door of his tent. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses faces to faces, as a man speaketh unto 
his neighbor. And he returned unto the camp; and his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a boy, moved not out of the midst of the tent. "And Moses took a tent," signifies what is holy of worship, of the 
church, and of the Word; "and stretched it for himself without the camp, afar off from the camp," signifies remote from the external things in which the nation itself was; "and he called it the tent 
of meeting," signifies the external of worship, of the church, and of the Word, in which are internal things; "and it was that everyone inquiring of Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting that was 
outside the camp," signifies that all instructions concerning the truths and goods of the church and of worship would be given to everyone by means of the external of the Word remotely from the external 
things in which that nation was; "and it was that when Moses went out unto the tent, all the people rose up, and stood, every man at the door of his tent," signifies that that nation was not in the 
external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, but was outside of it; "and looked after Moses, until he had entered into the tent," signifies that they see the external of the Word, of the church, 
and of worship, but that it vanishes from their apprehension; "and it was that when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and spoke with Moses," 
signifies that after the Word had vanished from their apprehension a dense obscurity took possession of them from without, and yet there was a clear perception from within; "and all the people saw 
the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent," signifies a dense obscurity taking possession of them from without; "and all the people rose up and bowed themselves, every man at the door of 
his tent," signifies that that nation adored their external in a holy manner; "and Jehovah spoke unto Moses faces to faces," signifies the Divine things in the Word conjoined together; "as a man speaketh 
unto his neighbor," signifies the conjunction of truth and good; "and he returned unto the camp," signifies unto the external in which that nation was; "and his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a 
boy, moved not out of the midst of the tent," signifies Divine truth meanwhile ministering in the holy things of the church and of worship in the place of Moses. </p>

Verses 7-11  And Moses took a tent and pitched it for himself outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tent of meeting. And so it was, that everyone asking Jehovah a question went out to 
the tent of meeting which was outside the camp. And so it was, when Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose and stood, each at the door of his tent, and looked after Moses<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> until he had 
entered the tent. And so it was, when Moses entered the tent, that the pillar of cloud came down, and stood at the door of the tent, and talked to Moses. And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing 
at the door of the tent; and all the people rose, and they bowed down, each at the door of his tent. And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man (vir) speaks to his neighbour. And he returned 
to the camp, and his minister Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not move away from the midst of the tent. </p>
<p>'And Moses took a tent' means the holiness of worship, the Church, and the Word. 
'And pitched it for himself outside the camp, far from the camp' means remote from the external things in which the interest of that actual nation lay. 'And called it the tent of meeting' means the external 
aspect of worship, the Church, and the Word, [which holds internal things within it.] 'And so it was, that everyone asking Jehovah a question went out to the tent of meeting which was outside 
the camp' means that all instruction regarding the truths and forms of good belonging to the Church and to worship was imparted to everyone through the outward sense of the Word, far removed from the 
external things in which alone the nation itself was interested. 'And so it was, when Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose and stood, [each] at the door of [his] tent' means that that 
nation did not abide in the external aspect of the Word, the Church, and worship, but outside it. 'And looked after Moses until he had entered the tent' means that they see the external aspect of the 
Word, the Church, and worship, but that it goes beyond what they are capable of understanding. 'And so it was, when Moses entered the tent, that the pillar of cloud came down, and stood at the door of 
the tent, and talked to Moses' means that when the Word had gone beyond what they were capable of understanding, extremely poor visibility descended on them away to the outside, and yet there was clear 
perception from within. 'And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent' means the extremely poor visibility descending on those to the outside. 'And all the people rose, 
and they bowed down, each at the door of [his] tent' means that nation's holy regard for and adoration of what was external with them. 'And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face' means Divine things 
in the Word that are joined together. 'As a man (vir) speaks to his neighbour' means the joining together of truth and good. 'And he returned to the camp' means going back to the external in which the 
interest of that nation lay. 'And his minister Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not move away from the midst of the tent' means Divine Truth ministering meantime in the holy things of the Church 
and worship in place of Moses.

Vers. 7-11.  Et Moscheh accepit tentorium, et tetendit sibi extra castra, elongando a castris, et vocavit illud tentorium conventus; et fuit, omnis interrogans Jehovam exivit ad tentorium conventus 
quod extra castra.  Et fuit, cum exivit Moscheh ad tentorium, surrexerunt omnis populus, et steterunt quisque ad ostium tentorii ejus, et spectarunt post Moschen usque ad intrare illum in tentorium.  
Et fuit, cum intravit Moscheh tentorium, descendit columna nubis, et stetit ad ostium tentorii, et loquebatur cum Moscheh.  Et vidit omnis populus columnam nubis stantem ad ostium tentorii, et surrexit 
omnis populus, et incurvaverunt se quisque ad ostium tentorii ejus.  Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen facies ad facies, quemadmodum loquitur vir ad proximum suum; et reversus est ad castra, et minister 
ejus Jehoschua filius Nunis puer non emovit se e medio tentorii.  `Et Moscheh accepit tentorium' significat sanctum cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi:  `et tetendit sibi extra castra, elongando a castris' 
significat remotum ab externis in quibus ipsa gens:  `et vocavit illud tentorium conventus' significat externum cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi [, in quo interna]:  et fuit omnis interrogans Jehovam exivit 
ad tentorium conventus quod extra castra' significat quod omnes instructiones de veris et boni Ecclesiae et cultus darentur cuique per (x)externum Verbi, remote ab externis in quibus erat gens illa: 
 `et fuit, cum exivit Moscheh ad tentorium, surrexerunt omnis populus, et steterunt ad ostium tentorii' significat quod gens illa non in externo Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus esset, sed extra illud: 
 `et spectarunt post Moschen usque dum intraret in tentorium' significat quod externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus videant sed quod evanescat ex captu eorum:  `et fuit, cum intravit Moscheh in tentorium, 
descendit columna nubis, et stetit ad ostium tentorii, et loquebatur cum Moscheh' significat postquam Verbum evanuit ex captu eorum, densum obscurum occuparet illos ad extra, et tamen clare perciperetur 
ab intra:  `et vidit omnis populus columnam nubis stantem ad ostium tentorii' significat densum obscurum occupans illos ad extra:  `et surrexit omnis populus, et incurvaverunt se quisque ad ostium 
tentorii' significat quod gens illa sancte adoraverit externum suum:  `et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen facies ad facies' significat Divina in Verbo conjuncta:  `quemadmodum loquitur vir ad proximum 
suum' significat conjunctionem veri et boni:  `et reversus est ad castra' significat ad externum in quo gens illa:  `et minister ejus Joschua filius Nunis puer non emovit se e medio tentorii' significat 
Divinum Verum ministrans in sanctis Ecclesiae et cultus loco Moschis interea. </p>
