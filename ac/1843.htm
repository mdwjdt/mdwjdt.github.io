<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1843节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1843.</strong>“你的种必寄居”表仁与信必极其稀少。这从“寄居”和“种”的含义清楚可知。“寄居”表示不是生在这地的人，因而他没有被视为本地人，而是被视为外来人。但“种”表示仁及其信（如前所示，<w1>255<w2>255<w3>，<w1>1025<w2>1025<w3>节，以及<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.3.htm">15:3</a>）。既被称为“寄居”，也就是被视为外来人，而外来人不在这地，或不属这地，那么可知，所表示的是极其稀少之物。因此，这里的意思是，仁与仁之信，也就是“种”必极其稀少。此处论述的是即将终结之前的时期，这时必有“大黑暗”，即虚假；此时，“种必寄居”，也就是说，仁与信必极其稀少。<br />主在论及世代的末了时，预言了信在末期将极其稀少（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.4.htm">24:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.51.htm">51</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.3.htm">13:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.37.htm">37</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.7.htm">21:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.38.htm">38</a>），这些地方所说的一切事都暗示，那时，仁与信必极其稀少，最终荡然无存。约翰在启示录，以及先知书中的许多经文也预言了同样的事，此外还有圣言历史部分所说的事。<br />但在末期即将消失的信无非是指仁，因为除了仁之信外，不可能存在其它信。人若没有仁，根本不会有任何信可言。因为仁是植入信的土壤，是信的心脏，信通过仁存在和存活。因此，古人将爱与仁比作心，将信比作肺，这二者都在胸腔里面。这种类比是十分恰当的比喻，因为幻想没有仁的信之生命，就象幻想没有心，只有肺的生命，这明显是不可能的。所以，古人将属于仁爱的一切称为心脏的事，将属于没有仁之信的一切称为唯独口唇上的事，或通过呼吸流入言语的肺的事。古时有关善与真的说法由此而来，因为善与真必从心发出。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1843.</strong> Your seed will be immigrants means that charity and faith would be rare, as can be seen from the symbolism of immigrants and of seed. Immigrants mean what is not native and so what is not acknowledged as belonging to the local area and therefore what is regarded as foreign. Seed, though, symbolizes charity and the faith that goes with it, as shown before, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025" target=_top>1025</a>, and above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_3" target=_top>3</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798" target=_top>1798:1</a>]. The seed is described as immigrants, which are viewed as foreign, and what is foreign is what does not belong to the area, or come from it, so it follows that it is something rare. It also follows, then, that charity and the faith that comes of charity would be rare, since that is what the seed is. When it says that Abram's seed would be immigrants — that is, that charity and faith would be rare — it is speaking about a time before the end, when the shadows (falsity) would be immense.<br />[2] In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/bible_king-james-version_matthew_24_4" target=_top>Matthew 24:4</a>-end, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/bible_king-james-version_mark_13_3" target=_top>Mark 13:3</a>-end, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/bible_king-james-version_luke_21_7" target=_top>Luke 21:7</a>-end, which describe the close of the age, the Lord predicts that faith will be rare in the last days. Everything said there carries the idea that charity and faith will be scant in those days, until finally they disappear. John predicts the same thing in the Book of Revelation, as the prophets also do many times, not to mention the narrative parts of the Word.{*1} [3] But by the faith that will perish in the final days nothing is meant but neighborly love. No other faith can possibly exist than the faith that grows out of love for others. People who do not love their neighbor cannot have the least faith. Love for others, or charity, is the actual base on which faith is planted. Charity is its heart, the source of its existence and life. As a result, the ancients compared love and charity to a heart, and faith to lungs, both of which reside in the chest. Charity and faith actually resemble the heart and lungs, too, because to imagine a life of faith without charity is like imagining we can live by our lungs alone, without our hearts. Anyone can see it is impossible. So the ancients called every impulse of charity a gesture of the heart, and every word of faith lacking in charity they called lip service, or a product of the lungs (by way of the breath that flows into speech). That is how they developed the habit of talking about goodness and truth as something that ought to "come from the heart."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a sampling of Scripture passages addressing the loss of charity and faith in the "last days," see Swedenborg's <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_179" target=_top>True Christianity 179</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_635" target=_top>635</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_755" target=_top>755</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_761" target=_top>761</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1843/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_764" target=_top>764</a>.

Thy seed shall be a stranger. That this signifies that charity and faith shall be rare, is evident from the signification of "a stranger," and of "seed." A "stranger" or "sojourner" signifies one that 
is not born in the land, so that he is not acknowledged as a native, and thus is looked upon as an alien. But "seed" signifies charity and its faith (as before shown, n. 255, 1025; and just above at 
verse 3). Because that is called "strange" which is looked upon as alien, and alien is that which is not in the land or of the land, it follows that it is that which is rare; and consequently it here 
means that charity and the faith of charity, which are the "seed," will be rare. It is the time before the consummation that is here treated of, when there shall be "great darkness," that is, falsities; 
the seed shall then be a stranger, that is, charity and faith will then be rare.  [2] That faith would be rare in the last times was foretold by the Lord when He spoke of the consummation of the 
age (Matt. 24:4-51; Mark 13:3-37; Luke 21:7-38), where everything that is said implies that charity and faith will be rare at those times, and that at last there will be none. The like is said by John 
in Revelation, and also in many passages of the Prophets, besides what is said in the historical parts of the Word.  [3] But by the faith that will perish in the last times there is meant nothing but 
charity, for there cannot possibly be any faith but the faith of charity. He who has not charity cannot have any faith at all, for charity is the very soil in which faith is implanted; it is its heart, 
from which it exists and lives. The ancients therefore compared love and charity to the heart, and faith to the lungs, both of which are in the breast. This comparison involves a real likeness, seeing 
that if a man should pretend to a life of faith without charity, it would be like having life from the lungs alone without the heart, which is manifestly impossible; and therefore the ancients called 
all things that pertain to charity things of the heart, and all things that pertain to faith without charity they said were of the mouth only, or of the lungs by the influx of the breathing into 
the speech. Thence came the ancient forms of speech concerning good and truth; that they must go forth from the heart. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1843</b></p><p><b>1843.</b>
That 'your seed will be strangers' means that charity and faith will be scarce is clear from the meaning of 'strange' and from the meaning of 'seed'. 'Strange' means not born in the land, thus not recognized 
as a native of it, and therefore looked upon as foreign. But 'seed' means charity and its attendant faith, as shown already in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, and above at verse 3. Since that which is looked upon 
as foreign is called 'strange' and foreign describes what is not within the land or of the land, that which is scarce is consequently meant. The meaning here therefore is that charity and its attendant 
faith, meant by 'seed', will be scarce. It is the time just before the close - when there is 'great darkness', or falsities - that is the subject; at this time the seed will be 'strangers', that is, 
charity and faith, will be scarce. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that faith would be scarce in the last times was foretold by the Lord when He described the close of the age, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:4-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:4-end</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:3-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:3-end</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2021:7-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 21:7-end</a>. Everything that is stated in these places implies that in those times charity and faith will be scarce, and that at length there will not be any at all. Something similar was foretold through 
John in the Book of Revelation, and also occurs many times in the Prophets, besides what appears in the historical sections of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But by the faith that is going to perish in the last 
times nothing other than charity is meant. No other faith can possibly exist, except faith that is grounded in charity. The person who has no charity is incapable of possessing any faith at all, charity 
being the soil in which faith is implanted, its heart from which it derives its being and life. The ancients for this reason compared love and charity to the heart, and faith to the lungs, both of 
which lie inside the breast. That comparison is also a perfect simile; for to imagine a life of faith without charity is like imagining life from the lungs alone without the heart, which is an impossibility, 
as may become clear to anyone. The ancients therefore used to call all things that belonged to charity those of the heart, and all that belonged to faith devoid of charity those of the lips alone, 
that is, of the lungs passing by means of breath into speech. From this came the sayings of old about the need for goods and truths to go forth from the heart. </p>

</p><b>1843.</b>
Quod 'peregrinum erit semen tuum' significet quod rara charitas et fides, constat a significatione 'peregrini' et a significatione 'seminis'; 'peregrinum' significat quod non natum in terra ita quod 
non agnoscitur pro indigena, proinde quod spectatur sic alienum; 'semen' autem significat charitatem et ejus fidem, ut ostensum prius n. 255, 1025, et supra ad vers. 3.  Quia 'peregrinum' dicitur quod 
spectatur ut alienum, et alienum est quod non in terra seu ex terra, sequitur quod sit id quod rarum, proinde quod charitas et fides charitatis erit rara, quae est 'semen'; agitur de tempore ante consummationem 
quando 'tenebrae magnae,' hoc est, falsitates, quod tunc 'semen peregrinum,' seu charitas et fides rara: [2] quod fides rara ultimis temporibus a Domino praedictum, ubi de consummatione saeculi, 
apud Matth. xxiv 4 ad fin.; Marc. xiii 3 ad fin.; Luc. xxi ad fin.; ubi quicquid dicitur, involvit quod illis temporibus rara charitas et fides, et quod tandem nulla; per Johannem in Apocalypsi 
similiter; tum quoque apud Prophetas multoties; praeter illa quae in historicis Verbi; [3] sed per fidem quae ultimis temporibus peritura, nihil aliud intelligitur quam charitas; nusquam alia fides 
datur quam fides charitatis; qui non charitatem habet, ne hilum fidei habere potest est charitas ipse fundus cui implantatur; est cor ejus ex quo est et vivit; ideo antiqui amorem et charitatem compararunt 
'cordi,' et fidem 'pulmoni,' quorum utramque in pectore; simile etiam est, nam vitam fidei absque charitate sibi fingere, est sicut vitam ex solo pulmone absque corde, quae quod non dabilis sit, 
unicuivis constare potest; ideo cordis vocabant omnia quae charitatis; et solius oris seu pulmonis per respirationis influxum in loquelam, omnia quae fidei absque charitate; formulae inde antiquae de 
bonis et veris quod ex corde exire debeant. </p>
