<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5505节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5505.</strong>“他们来到”表随后的改造状态。这从“来到他们的父亲雅各那里”含义清楚可知，“来到他们的父亲雅各那里”在此是指随后的改造状态。“他们的父亲雅各”代表属世层中的真理之良善，“来到”这良善表示被改造到如此程度。因为就内义而言，所论述的主题是由雅各的儿子们所代表的教会真理，即它们如何被植入属世层，此后与属灵层的属天层联结；或也可说，外在人中的真理如何与内在人中源于神性的真理联结。由此明显可知，“他们来到”在此表示随后的改造状态。</p>

And they came. That this signifies what is successive of reformation, is evident from the signification of "coming to Jacob their father," as here being what is successive of reformation; for by Jacob 
their father is represented the good of truth in the natural, and to "come" to this is to be so far reformed. For in the internal sense the subject treated of is the truths of the church, which are 
represented by the sons of Jacob, how they were implanted in the natural, and afterward conjoined with the celestial of the spiritual; or what is the same, how truths in the external man were conjoined 
with truths from the Divine in the internal. From all this it is evident that by their "coming" is here signified what is successive of reformation. </p>

'And they came' means a subsequent state of reformation. This is clear from the meaning here of 'coming', coming to Jacob their father, as a subsequent state of reformation. 'Jacob their father' represents 
the good of truth in the natural, and 'coming' to this good means being reformed thus far. For the subject in the internal sense is how the truths known to the Church, which are represented by 
'the sons of Jacob', were implanted in the natural and after that became joined to the celestial of the spiritual, or what amounts to the same, how truths in the external man became joined to truths from 
the Divine in the internal man. From all this it is evident that here 'they came' means a subsequent state of reformation.  </p>

</p><b>5505.</b>
`Et venerunt': quod significet successivum reformationis, constat ex significatione `venire' nempe ad Jacobum patrem suum, quod hic {1} sit successivum reformationis, per `Jacobum' enim `patrem illorum' 
repraesentatur bonum veri in naturali, ad hoc venire est eo usque reformari; nam in sensu interno agitur de veris Ecclesiae quae per `filios Jacobi' repraesentantur, quomodo illa implantata sunt 
naturali et dein conjuncta caelesti spiritualis, seu quod idem, quomodo vera in externo homine conjuncta sunt veris a Divino in interno; ex his patet quod per `venerunt' hic significetur successivum reformationis. @1
