<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1895.</strong>“她有一个埃及婢女”表知识的情感。这从“婢女”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知。作为主母或夫人的撒莱代表和表示与良善联结的真理，如前所述。与良善联结的真理才是真正意义上的智性真理，而理性真理在此之下，因而相对低级。理性真理是由知识和认知生出的，而这知识和认知已通过与其相应的情感被复活。这种情感因属于外在人，故理应服侍属于至内在之人的智性真理，如同婢女服侍她的主母，或家佣服侍她的夫人。因此，这种情感就是“婢女夏甲”所代表和表示的。<br />没人能清楚理解所说的这些事，除非他知道何为真正意义上的智性真理，以及理性人如何生出，也就是说，理性人通过如同父亲的内在人和如同母亲的外在人或属世人生出。因为没有这二者的融合，理性之物不可能生成。理性人并不象人们所以为的那样由知识和认知生出，而是由对它们的情感生出。这一点仅从以下事实就能看出来，即没人能变得理性，除非这些知识和认知的某种快乐或情感在他里面燃烧。这种情感构成母亲般的生命本身，而这情感里面的属天和属灵之物则构成父亲般的生命。所以，人情感的程度和品质决定了在他里面所发展的理性的程度和品质。知识和认知本身无非是死物，是工具因，它们通过情感的生命被复活。这就是每个人的理性人被孕育的方式。婢女是埃及人，并且经上也提及这一事实，是因为“埃及”表知识，如前所示（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。</p>

And she had a handmaid, an Egyptian. That this signifies the affection of memory-knowledges [scientiae], is evident from the signification of a "handmaid," and from the signification of "Egypt." Sarai, 
who was the mistress or lady, represents and signifies truth adjoined to good, as already said. Truth adjoined to good is intellectual truth in the genuine sense, but rational truth is beneath this 
and therefore is lower; and this rational truth is born from knowledges [scientiae et cognitiones] vivified by the affection that corresponds to them, and this affection, being of the exterior man, ought 
to serve the intellectual truth that appertains to the inmost man, as a handmaid serves her lady, or a household servant her mistress; and therefore this affection is what is represented and signified 
by the "handmaid Hagar."  [2] How these things stand cannot well be stated to the apprehension, for it must first be known what intellectual truth in the genuine sense is, and also how the rational 
is born, namely, from the internal man as a father, and from the exterior or natural man as a mother, for without the conjunction of these two nothing rational can possibly come forth. The rational 
is not born (as is supposed) of knowledges [scientiae et cognitiones], but of the affection of these knowledges, as may be seen from the mere fact that no one can ever become rational unless some delight 
or affection of these knowledges aspires thereto. The affection is the maternal life itself; and the celestial and spiritual itself, in the affection, is the paternal life; therefore in proportion 
to the affection, and in accordance with the quality of the affection, in the same proportion, and in the same quality, does the man become rational. In themselves these knowledges are nothing but 
dead things, or instrumental causes, which are vivified by the life of affection; and such is the conception of the rational man in everyone. The reason why the handmaid was an Egyptian, and the reason 
why this fact is stated, is that "Egypt" signifies memory-knowledges [scientiae], as before shown (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462). </p>

'She had an Egyptian servant-girl' means the affection for knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'a servant-girl' and from the meaning of 'Egypt'. Sarai, who is the mistress or lady, represents 
and means truth allied to good, as stated already. Truth allied to good is in the genuine sense intellectual truth, but rational truth comes below this and so is inferior. The latter is born from knowledge 
and cognitions that have been made living by means of an affection corresponding to them. Because this affection is part of the exterior man, it ought to be subservient to intellectual truth, 
which resides inmostly, in the way that a servant-girl is subservient to her mistress or a maid to the lady of - the house. That affection therefore is what is represented and meant by 'the servant-girl 
Hagar'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 No one can have much understanding of anything said about these matters until he knows what intellectual truth is in the genuine sense and also in what way the rational is born, namely 
from the internal man as the father, and from the exterior or natural man as the mother. Unless the two are joined together nothing rational ever comes into being. The rational is not born from knowledge 
and cognitions, as people suppose, but from the affection for them, as becomes clear merely from the fact that nobody can possibly become rational unless some delight in or affection for such knowledge 
and cognitions burns within him. The affection constitutes the maternal life itself, while the celestial and spiritual within that affection constitute the paternal life. Consequently it is the 
degree and the quality of a person's affection that determine the degree and the quality of the rationality that is developed in him. In themselves facts and cognitions are nothing other than things 
that are dead, or instrumental causes, which are made alive by the life that belongs to affection. This is how everyone's rational man is conceived. The reason why the servant-girl was Egyptian and 
why that fact is mentioned is that 'Egypt' means knowledge, as has been shown already in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, </p>

`Et ei ancilla Aegyptia': quod significet affectionem scientiarum, constat ex significatione `ancillae,' et ex significatione `Aegypti.' `Sarai,' quae hera seu domina, repraesentat et significat verum 
adjunctum bono, ut prius dictum; verum adjunctum bono est verum intellectuale in genuino sensu; verum autem rationale est intra illud, ita inferius; hoc nascitur a scientiis et cognitionibus vivificatis 
per affectionem eis correspondentem, quae affectio, quia est exterioris hominis, servire debet vero intellectuali quod est apud intimum, sicut ancilla herae aut famula dominae; quare illa affectio 
est quae repraesentatur et significatur per `ancillam Hagarem.' [2] Haec quomodo se habent, non ita ad captum dici potest {1}, prius enim sciendum est quid verum intellectuale in genuino sensu, tum 
quomodo nascitur rationale, quod nempe ab interno homine ut patre, et (o)ab exteriore seu naturali ut matre; absque conjunctione utriusque {2} nusquam aliquid rationale existit: rationale non nascitur 
a scientiis et cognitionibus, ut putatur, sed ab affectione scientiarum et cognitionum, ut constare solum potest ex eo quod nusquam aliquis rationalis possit fieri, nisi aliquod {3} jucundum seu affectio 
scientiarum et cognitionum aspiret; affectio est ipsa vita materna, et {4} ipsum caeleste et spirituale in affectione est vita paterna; inde quantum affectionis, et qualis affectio, tantum rationalis, 
et taliter rationalis, fit homo; scientifica et cognitiones in se non sunt nisi res mortuae seu causae instrumentales, quae per vitam affectionis vivificantur; haec est conceptio rationalis hominis 
apud unumquemvis.  Quod fuerit ancilla Aegyptia, et hoc dicatur, causa est quia `Aegyptus' significat scientias, ut ostensum prius n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462. 	@1 A d potest, i possunt.$ 	@2 i quasi
