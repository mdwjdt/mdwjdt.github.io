<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4868节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4868.</strong>“说，来吧！让我与你同寝”表结合的欲望。这从“与人同寝”的含义清楚可知，“与人同寝”是指结合（<a href="4820.htm">4820</a>节）。显然，此处所指的欲望是与一个妓女结合的欲望，在内义上则是与虚假结合的欲望。“犹大”在此所表示的犹太民族（<a href="4815.htm">4815</a>，<a href="4842.htm">4842</a>，<a href="4864.htm">4864</a>节）只是将代表性教会的内在真理视为虚假，如今也是如此看待，这从前面（<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>节）可以看出来。此处论述的是，尽管这个民族与该真理结合，但不是像与一个妻子那样结合，而是像与一个妓女那样结合，也就是说，不是像与真理那样结合，而是像与虚假那样结合。欲望用来描述与虚假的结合，就像与一个妓女结合一样。<br />凡唯独相信圣言的外在意义，也就是只相信它的字义，完全弃绝它的一切内在，也就是其灵义的人都如同一个妓女那样与内在真理结合。那些利用圣言的外在意义或字义来支持属于其自我之爱和尘世之爱的欲望，也就是统治和谋利的欲望之人尤其如此。那些如此行的人只会以这种方式看待内在真理；他们若与它结合，也是出于欲望结合，如同与一个妓女结合。犹太民族的成员就是这样做的，圣言中巴比伦所指的那些人也是这样做的。但那些虽简单地相信圣言的字义，然而却照着包含在内义中的事物生活，也就是处于爱与仁，以及处于源自这些的信（因为这三者就是圣言内义的主题）之人，以及那些出于字义教导这些事的人则不然。事实上，内在意义和外在意义都归结于这两条诫命：爱主高于一切，爱邻如己。<br />让我们举例说明：犹太民族视内在真理为妓女，即便与之结合，也是出于欲望这样做，如同与妓女结合。例如，若被告知，圣言是神圣的，甚至最神圣的，而且其中的一点一划也都是神圣的，他们虽然承认，并将自己与这些话联系在一起；然而，他们却是出于一种欲望而如此行。因为他们以为，这种神圣性在圣言的实际文字中，并不相信当人们怀着对良善与真理的情感阅读圣言时，这种神圣性便通过圣言流入进来。<br />若被告知，圣言中提到的许多人物要被尊为圣，如亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、摩西、亚伦、大卫等，他们虽然承认，并将自己与之联系在一起，但却是出于一种欲望而如此行，因为他们以为这些历史人物优先于其他人被选中，并因此而神圣，也因此而应被拜为神明。然而，这些人拥有神圣性唯独由于这一事实：他们代表主。没有人因作了一个神圣的代表就会经历人格上的变化。此外，每个人死后的生活无一例外地与死前一模一样。<br />若被告知，他们当中的约柜、圣殿、燔祭坛、香坛、陈设饼、灯台和灯台上的灯、常常烧着的火、祭物、香、油，以及亚伦的圣衣，尤其上面有乌陵和土明的胸牌，都是神圣的，他们虽然承认这一点，并将自己与它联系在一起，但却出于相同的欲望。因为他们以为这些事物本身是神圣的，因而木、石、金、银、饼、火是神圣的；他们之所以认为这些东西有神圣在里面，是因为耶和华在它们里面。也就是说，他们认为依附于这些物体的耶和华的神圣实实在在地住在他们里面。这就是他们的内在真理，然而，与纯正的真理相比，这是虚假。因为神圣唯独存在于良善与真理里面，而良善与真理因来自主，故居于对主之爱和对邻之爱里面，并由此居于信里面。因此，它只存在于活物里面，也就是那些从主接受这些恩赐的人里面。<br />若被告知，基督教会与建在他们中间的教会为一，只是基督教会是内在的，而他们的教会是外在的，以致当建在他们中间的教会被剥去其外在，并赤露敞开时，基督教会就会显露出来，他们并不承认这一真理，只是视之为妓女，也就是视之为虚假。然而，他们当中许多从犹太教改信基督教的人会将自己与该真理联系在一起，却也是出于相同的欲望。在圣言中，这种事常被称为“淫乱”。然而，至于圣言中“巴比伦”所表示的那些人，他们以同样的方式看待教会的内在真理；但他们因了解内在事物，而且童年时就承认它们，但到了成年却拒绝承认，故在圣言中被描述为污秽的淫行和可憎的淫合；因为它们就是亵渎。</p>

And said, Grant I pray that I may come to thee. That this signifies lust for conjunction, is evident from the signification of "coming or entering to anyone" as being to be conjoined (n. 4820). That 
lust is meant such as is that for conjunction with a harlot, is plain; in the internal sense, with falsity. That the Jewish nation, which is here signified by "Judah" (n. 4815, 4842, 4864), regarded the 
internal truth of the representative church no otherwise than as falsity, and also at this day so regards it, can be seen above (n. 4865). What is now here treated of is that nevertheless this nation 
conjoined itself with this truth, yet not as with a wife, but as with a harlot, that is, not as with truth, but as with falsity. Lust is predicated of conjunction with falsity, just as of conjunction 
with a harlot. [2] All those conjoin themselves with internal truth as with a harlot who believe only the external sense of the Word, that is, only its literal sense, and entirely reject all its internal, 
that is, its spiritual sense; but especially those who apply the external or literal sense of the Word to favor the cupidities of the love of self and of the world, or of rule and gain. They 
who do this cannot but regard internal truth in this way; and if they conjoin themselves with it, they do so from lust as for conjunction with a harlot. This is done especially by those who are of the 
Jewish nation, and also by those who in the Word are meant by Babylon; but not by those who indeed believe in simplicity the literal sense of the Word, and yet live according to those things which are 
of the internal sense, that is in love and charity, and thence in faith-for these are of the internal sense of the Word-and who also from the literal sense teach these things; for the internal and the 
external sense come together in the two precepts-to love the Lord above all things, and the neighbor as one's self.  [3] That the Jewish nation regard internal truth as a harlot, and that, if they 
conjoin themselves with it, they do so from lust as for conjunction with a harlot, may be illustrated by the following examples. If they are told that the Word is holy, even most holy, also that every 
tittle therein is holy, they acknowledge it and conjoin themselves, but this from such lust; for they believe that it is holy in the letter, and not that by this means the holy flows in with those who 
when they read it are in the affection of good and truth. [4] If they are told that many who are mentioned in the Word are to be venerated as holy-as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David-they 
acknowledge it and conjoin themselves, but from such a lust; for they believe that these persons were chosen in preference to others, that they are therefore holy, and that they should for this reason 
be worshiped as deities; when yet these men have holiness from no other source than this, that they represented the Lord; and a holy representative does not at all affect the person. Moreover, the 
life of everyone without distinction remains with him after death. [5] If they are told that the ark that was with them, the temple, the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, the bread upon 
the table, the lampstand with its lamps, the perpetual fire, the sacrifices, the incenses, the oil, also the garments of Aaron, especially the breastplate on which were the Urim and Thummim, were holy, 
they acknowledge it and conjoin themselves, but from the same lust; for they believe that these things were holy in themselves, thus that the wood, the stone, the gold, silver, bread, and fire were 
holy, and this interiorly because Jehovah was in them, or that the holiness of Jehovah applied to them was actually in them. This is their internal truth, which yet is relative falsity; for the holy is 
solely in good and truth, which is from the Lord in love to Him and in love toward the neighbor, and thence in faith; thus only in living subjects, that is, in men who receive these things from the 
Lord. [6] Again, if they are told that the Christian Church is one with the church that was instituted with them, but that it is internal, whereas theirs was external, so that when the church instituted 
with them is stripped of its externals and laid bare, the Christian Church comes to view, they do not acknowledge this truth otherwise than as a harlot, that is, as falsity. Nevertheless some of them, 
who are converted from Judaism to Christianity, conjoin themselves with this truth, but also from the same lust. Such things in the Word are often called "whoredoms." In regard to those, however, 
who are signified in the Word by "Babylon," these regard in a similar way the internal truths of the church; but because they are acquainted with internal things, and also acknowledge them in childhood, 
but deny them in adult age, they are described in the Word by foul adulteries and abominable copulations; for they are profanations. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4868</b></p><p><b>4868.</b>
'And said, Allow me now to come [in] to you' means a lustful desire to be connected with it. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming (or going in) to someone' as being joined to, dealt with in <a href="4820.htm">4820</a>. 
The meaning here - a lustful desire like that involved in connection with a prostitute, by whom falsity is meant in the internal sense - is self-evident. For the Jewish nation, meant here by 'Judah', <a href="4815.htm">4815</a>, <a href="4842.htm">4842</a>, <a href="4864.htm">4864</a>, looked on the internal truth of the representative Church, and still looks on it at the present day, as nothing else than falsity, see above in <a href="4865.htm">4865</a>. Dealt with here is the fact that 
it nevertheless linked itself to that truth, not however as a wife but as a prostitute; that is, it did not link itself to it as truth but as falsity. The expression 'a lustful desire' is used to describe 
a link with falsity that is like a connection with a prostitute. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All who believe solely the external sense of the Word, that is, its literal sense, and completely cast aside the whole internal 
- that is, spiritual - sense link themselves to internal truth as to a prostitute. This is above all the case among those who employ the external or literal sense of the Word to lend support to 
the desires that belong to their self-love and love of the world, that is, the desires for rule and gain. Those who behave like this cannot do other than look on internal truth in that kind of way; 
and if they attach themselves to it they do so with a lustful desire, like that for connection with a prostitute. Members of the Jewish nation in particular do this, and so also do those meant in the 
Word by Babel. But those people are different who do, it is true, have a simple belief in the literal sense of the Word, yet lead lives in keeping with what is contained in the internal sense. That is 
to say, they are people with whom love and charity exist, and also faith derived from these (for these three are the subject in the internal sense of the Word); also they are people who base their teachings 
on these. For the internal sense and the external sense come together in the two commandments, to love the Lord above all things and one's neighbour as oneself </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Let some examples show that 
the Jewish nation regards internal truth as a prostitute, and that if it associates itself with that truth it does so from a lustful desire akin to that for a connection with that kind of woman. If, 
for example, they are told that the Word is holy, indeed most holy, and also that every part of a letter there is holy, they acknowledge and associate themselves with what is said; yet they do so from 
that kind of lustful desire. For they believe that holiness lies within the actual letter of the Word and not that holiness is something which enters by means of the Word when people with an affection 
for what is good and true read it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 If they are told that many of those mentioned in the Word are to be revered as holy ones - such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, or David - they acknowledge 
and associate themselves with this. But they do so from a like lustful desire, for they believe that these historical figures were chosen in preference to others and are on that account holy 
ones, who ought therefore to be worshipped as gods. Any holiness attached to these figures however is due solely to the fact that they represented the Lord. No one by being a holy representative undergoes 
a change of personality; indeed one can go further and say that without exception everyone's life after death is the same as before it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 If they are told that the ark among them, the temple, 
the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, the bread on the table, the lampstand with its lamps, the continual fire, the sacrifices, the incense, the oil, and also Aaron's vestments, especially 
the breastplate with the urim and thummim on it, were holy, they acknowledge this and associate themselves with it, but from the same kind of lustful desire. For they believe that all these objects 
were inherently holy, thus that wood, stone, gold, silver, bread, and fire were so; they believe that they had holiness in them because Jehovah was within them. That is to say, they believe that the 
holiness of Jehovah which was attached to these objects resided in actual fact within them. This is their internal truth, which however is falsity when compared with genuine truth; for holiness exists 
solely within good and truth which, being from the Lord, reside within love to Him and love towards the neighbour, and from these within faith. It accordingly exists only within the living, that is, 
within those who accept these gifts from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 If they are told that the Christian Church is one with the Church that was established among them but that the Christian was internal whereas 
theirs was external, so that when the external features of the Church established among them are peeled away and it is laid bare, the Christian Church is seen, they do not acknowledge this truth as 
anything else than a harlot, that is, as something false. Nevertheless many of them who are converted from Judaism to Christianity associate themselves with this truth; but they do so from a lustful desire. 
Many times in the Word these kinds of things are called acts of whoredom. As regards those however who are meant in the Word by 'Babylon', they likewise look in a similar way on the internal truths 
of the Church; yet because they have a knowledge of internal things, and in addition acknowledge these during childhood but in adult life refuse to do so, they are described in the Word by means 
of foul acts of adultery and unmentionable sexual unions; for they are forms of profanation. </p>

`Et dixit, Da quaeso veniam ad te': quod significet libidinem conjunctionis, constat ex significatione `venire seu intrare ad aliquam' quod sit conjungi, de qua n. 4820; quod sit libido qualis est 
conjunctionis cum {1}meretrice, patet, in sensu interno cum falso; {2}quod gens Judaica, quae hic per Jehudam significatur n. 4815, 4842, 4864, verum internum Ecclesiae repraesentativae non aliter 
consideraverit ac falsum, et quod hodie nec aliter (c)id consideret, videatur supra n. 4865; hic nunc agitur de eo quod usque {3} conjunxerit cum illo, at non ut cum uxore sed {4}ut cum meretrice, 
hoc est, non ut cum vero sed ut cum falso; de conjunctione cum falso, sicut de conjunctione cum meretrice, praedicatur libido. Omnes illi se conjungunt 2 cum vero interno ut cum {1}meretrice qui 
sensum externum Verbi, hoc est, sensum ejus litteralem unice credunt, et prorsus rejiciunt omnem {5}ejus sensum internum, hoc est, spiritualem; sed principaliter illi qui sensum externum seu litteralem 
Verbi applicant ad favorem cupiditatum amoris sui et mundi, seu dominationis et lucri; qua hoc faciunt, nequaquam aliter possunt quam spectare verum internum sicut tale, et si (t)se cum illo conjungunt, 
faciunt id ex libidine sicut conjunctionis cum {6}meretrice; hoc faciunt imprimis illi qui ex gente {7}Judaica sunt; et quoque illi qui per Babelem in Verbo intelliguntur non autem illi 
qui quidem sensum litteralem Verbi simpliciter credunt et usque secundum illa quae sunt sensus interni vivunt, nempe in amore et charitate et inde fide, nam haec sunt sensus interni Verbi, etiam qui 
illa inde docent; sensus enim {8}internus et sensus {8}externus in duobus illis praeceptis, nempe amare Dominum supra omnia et 3 proximum sicut seipsum, conveniunt. Quod gens Judaica spectet verum 
internum sicut {9}meretricem, et si cum illo se conjungit, quod ex libidine sicut conjunctionis cum tali faciat, sint illustrationi exempla: ut si illis dicitur quod Verbum sanctum sit, immo quod 
sanctissimum etiam quod unusquisque apex ibi sanctus sit, agnoscunt et se conjungunt, sed hoc ex tali libidine, nam sanctum in littera credunt et non quod (t)per (c)illud influat sanctum apud (c)eos 
qui in affectione 4 boni et veri sunt cum (c)id legunt. Si illis dicitur quod plures qui in Verbo nominantur, venerandi sint ut sancti, sicut Abraham, Jishak, Jacob, Moses, Aharon, David, id agnoscunt 
et se conjungunt, sed ex simili libidine, credunt enim quod illi electi prae aliis fuerint et inde sancti, et quod ideo sicut numina colendi; cum tamen non aliunde sanctum sit illis quam quod 
repraesentaverint Dominum, et sanctum repraesentativum nihil afficit personam; et praeterea {10}vita sua 5 unumquemvis absque discrimine {11}manet post mortem. Si illis dicitur quod arca apud illos, 
templum, altare holocausti, altare suffitus, panis super mensa, candelabrum cum lucernis, ignis perpetuus, sacrificia, suffimenta, olea, tum vestes Aharonis, imprimis pectorale super quo urim et 
thummim, sancta fuerint, agnoscunt et se conjungunt, sed ex tali libidine, nam credunt illa in se sancta fuisse, ita lignum, lapidem aurum, argentum, panem, ignem, et hoc interius quia Jehovah in 
illis, seu quod sanctitas Jehovae illis applicata actualiter in illis fuerit; hoc verum eorum internum est quod tamen respective falsum: sanctum enim solum inest bono et vero, quod a Domino est in 
amore in Ipsum et in amore erga proximum, atque inde in fide, ita non nisi quam in vivis, hoc est, in hominibus qui recipiunt illa a Domino.  Si illis dicitur quod Ecclesia Christiana sit una cum 
Ecclesia quae 6 apud illos instituta {12}fuit, sed quod illa sit interna, haec autem fuerat externa, sic ut cum Ecclesia apud illos instituta exuitur externis et nudatur, appareat Christiana, hoc non 
agnoscunt aliter ac scortum, hoc est, falsum; sed usque plures eorum qui a Judaismo ad Christianismum convertuntur, cum illo vero se conjungunt, sed quoque ex tali libidine. Talia in Verbo pluries 
vocantur scortationes {13}. Quod autem illos attinet qui in Verbo significantur per `Babelem', ii similiter considerant vera interna Ecclesiae, sed quia ii norunt interna, et quoque in pueritia agnoscunt 
illa, {14}ast in adulta aetate negant, describuntur in Verbo per foeda adulteria et nefandos concubitus, nam sunt profanationes. @1 scorto$ @2 respective ad religiosum in quo gens Judaica,
