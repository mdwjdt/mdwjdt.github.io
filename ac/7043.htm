<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7043节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7043.</strong>“想要杀他”表无法在这些后代中间建立一个代表性教会。这从“想要杀”的含义清楚可知，“想要杀”是指不接受（参看<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>节）；故在此是指不接受或不选择这个民族，以便一个代表性教会能在他们中间建立。在这三节经文中，“摩西”一直表示这个民族，“摩西”即将成为这个民族的领袖和头领（参看<a href="7041.htm">7041</a>节）；这个民族没有被选中，然而它固执地坚持它要成为一个教会（<a href="4290.htm">4290</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>节）；在这个民族中间建立的，只是一个教会的代表，而不是教会（<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>节）；教会的神圣事物甚至也能由恶人来代表，因为代表不关注代表的这个人，只关注他所代表的事物（<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>节）。经上说，耶和华想要彻底毁灭这个民族，从摩西兴起另一个民族（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.12.htm">14:12</a>），还有耶和华后悔引领这个民族，或把那百姓带到迦南地，在内义上表示类似的事。</p>

And sought to kill him. That this signifies that a representative church could not be instituted with that posterity, is evident from the signification of "seeking to kill," as being not to receive (see 
n. 3387, 3395); here therefore not to receive or choose that nation, in order that a representative church might be instituted with it. That in these three verses that nation is constantly meant by 
"Moses," who was about to be its leader and head, may be seen above (n. 7041); and that that nation was not chosen, but that it obstinately insisted upon being a church (n. 4290, 4293); and also that 
no church, but only the representative of a church, was instituted with it (n. 4281, 4288, 6304); and that those things which are of the church, and are holy, can be represented even by the evil, because 
representation does not regard the person but the thing (n. 3670, 4208, 4281). The same is meant in the internal sense by its being said that Jehovah willed wholly to destroy that nation, and in 
its stead to raise up another nation from Moses (Num. 14:12); and also that Jehovah repented of bringing in that nation, and of having brought them into the land of Canaan. </p>

'And sought to kill him' means that a representative Church could not be established among those descendants. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeking to kill' as not receiving, dealt with in <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>, here therefore as not receiving or choosing that nation in order that a representative Church might be established among them. That nation is what Moses their future leader and head is consistently 
used to mean in these three verses, see above in <a href="7041.htm">7041</a>. </p>
<p>That nation was not chosen, yet it stubbornly insisted that it should be the Church, see <a href="4290.htm">4290</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>. </p>
<p>No Church, only a representative 
of the Church was established among that nation, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>. </p>
<p>Holy things of the Church can be represented even by wicked people, for in a representation no attention is paid to the person who 
represents, only to the thing represented by him, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>. </p>
<p>Something similar to what is meant here in the internal sense is contained in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2014:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 14:12</a>, where it says that Jehovah wished to destroy 
that nation completely and in their place raise up from Moses another nation, and also where it says that Jehovah regretted that He was going to lead, or that He had led that people into the land 
of Canaan. </p>

`Et quaesivit occidere illum': quod significet quod apud illam Ecclesia repraesentativa non institui posset, constat ex significatione `quaerere occidere' quod sit non recipere, de qua n. 3387, 3395, 
hic itaque non recipere seu eligere gentem illam, ut apud (c)eam Ecclesia repraesentativa institueretur; gens illa per Moschen futurum illius ducem et caput jugiter in (t)tribus his versibus intelligitur, 
videatur supra n. 7041; quod gens illa non electa sit, sed quod contumaciter institerit ut esset Ecclesia, videatur n. 4290, 4293; et quod non aliqua Ecclesia sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae 
apud illam {1}institutum fuerit, n. 4281, 4288, 6304; quodque illa quae Ecclesiae et sancta sunt repraesentari possint etiam a malis, quia repraesentativum non spectat personam sed rem, n. 3670, 4208, 
4281.  Simile quod hic in sensu interno intelligitur per id quod Jehovah gentem illam prorsus delere vellet, et loco ejus aliam gentem ex Mosche exsuscitare, (d)Num. xiv 12; et quoque quod dicatur 
quod `(x)Jehovam' paenituerit' quod gentem illam introduceret, et quod introduxerit in terram Canaanem. 	@1 instituta$ </p>
