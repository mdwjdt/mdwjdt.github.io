<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1661节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1661.</strong>“当暗拉非作示拿王、亚略作以拉撒王、基大老玛作以拦王、提达作戈印王的日子”表如此多种表面的良善与真理，它们存在于主的外在人中，本身并非良善与真理。这从所有这些细节的内义和下文清楚可知。因为所论述的主题是主与恶与假的争战，这里论述的是发生在祂童年和青少年早期期间的第一次争战。在祂具有知识和认知之后，祂首先卷入并忍受这种冲突，故此处经上说“在这些王的日子”。<br />若不知道何为恶与假，因此若不接受教导，没人能对抗恶与假。人在能充分运用理解力和判断之前，并不知道何为罪恶，更不知道何为虚假。这就是为何人直到成年才会进入试探的原因。因此，每个人成年后都会被试探，但主早在童年时就被试探<br />每个人首先通过他经由认知所接受的良善与真理争战；他出于并凭借它们判断恶与假。刚开始争战时，每个人也以为他争战所凭借的良善与真理是他自己的，也就是说，他将它们归给自己，同时将他借以抵抗的力量也归给自己。这是可以的，因为那时此人不知道别的。人在重生前决不会知道，甚至能说他知道、承认并相信：良善与真理丝毫不是来自他自己，一切良善与真理皆来自主；他也不可能知道他并不能凭自己的力量抵抗任何恶与假。事实上，他不知道恶灵激活并注入恶与假；更不知道他通过恶灵与地狱相联；那地狱对他施加压力，如同海水给堤坝的每个部分施加压力，他凭自己的力量决不能抵抗地狱的这种压力。然而，由于他在重生前只会以为他凭自己的力量抵抗，故这也是可以的，在此情况下，他被引入争战或试探中。然而，随后他会越来越摆脱偏见。<br />当人处于这样的状态，即他以为良善与真理源于他自己，抵抗的力量也是他自己的时，他对抗恶与假所凭借的良善与真理并非真的良善与真理，无论它们看上去有多相似；因为它们里面有他自己的东西，他将自我功德置于胜利中，并进行夸耀，仿佛是他战胜了恶与假，而事实上，唯独主争战并得胜。只有那些通过试探经历重生之人才知道，这是千真万确的事实。<br />由于主在童年早期就被引入与恶和假的最严厉的争战中，所以那时祂也不可避免地有这种想法；之所以出现这种情况，原因有两个：一是根据神序，祂的人性本质理应通过不断的争战和得胜而被引入神性本质，并与之结合；二是祂对抗恶与假所凭借的良善与真理属于外在人。由于这些良善与真理并不完全是神性，故它们被称为表面的良善与真理。祂的神性本质以这种方式引入祂的人性本质，是为了它可以凭自己的力量战胜。不过，此处的奥秘比所描述的还要多。总之，在最初的争战中，主借以争战并居于祂里面的良善与真理渗透着来自母亲的遗传之物，它们只要渗透着来自母亲的遗传之物，就不是神性。然而，随着祂逐渐战胜恶与假，它们会得以净化，并变成神性。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1661.</strong> And it happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch, king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim, symbolizes just so many different categories of apparent goodness and truth (which are not good or true in and of themselves) in the Lord's outer self. This can be seen from the inner-level symbolism of all these kings, as well as from what follows. The subject is the Lord's combat with evil and falsity, and here it is about his first struggle, which took place in his adolescence and at the dawn of his adulthood. It was a struggle that he first faced and underwent after he had been trained in both secular and religious knowledge. That is why the verse says that it happened in the days of these kings.<br />[2] None of us can possibly fight evil and falsity until we know how to recognize them and consequently until we have been educated. We do not know what evil is, still less what falsity is, until we come into the capacities of intellect and judgment. That is the reason we do not undergo spiritual trials until we reach adult age 钬?the age of majority in our case, of adolescence in the Lord's.<br />The very first weapons that any of us wield are the good impulses and true concepts we have acquired by learning about them. These we use as the basis and means for evaluating evil impulses and false concepts.<br />[3] When we first start to fight, we universally believe that the goodness and truth we wield are our own; we take credit for them and also for the power to resist. Such an attitude is acceptable, because at that point we are incapable of knowing any better. Until we have been reborn there is much that we cannot possibly see clearly enough to say that we know, acknowledge, and believe it. We do not see that nothing good or true comes from us, that everything good and true comes from the Lord, and that we have no power of our own to resist anything evil or false. We do not realize that evil spirits stir up the evil and falsity they flood us with. Still less do we realize that evil spirits put us in touch with hell, or that hell exerts as much pressure on us as the ocean does on each stone in a jetty 钬?far too much pressure for us ever to resist by our own strength. Still, since until we regenerate we cannot help supposing the power is ours, we are allowed to think this way and so to be introduced into the battles of spiritual crisis. Later on, though, we start to see the light.<br />[4] While we are at the stage of imagining that goodness and truth come from ourselves and that the strength to resist is ours, the goodness and truth with which we fight evil and falsity are neither good nor true, even though they seem to be so. An inflated sense of self lurks inside them, and we take credit for the victory. We pride ourselves on having conquered evil and falsity, when it is the Lord alone who fights and wins. No one can see the truth of this but those reborn through times of tribulation.<br />[5] The Lord was introduced into fearsome struggles against evil and falsity in his early adolescence, and at that time he too could not imagine any differently. This was partly due to the divine plan 钬?that his human side be introduced to and united with his divine side through constant battles and victories. It was also due to the fact that the goodness and truth he used in the combat with evil and falsity belonged to his outer self. So the goodness and truth were not entirely divine, which is why they are called apparent goodness and truth. For all these reasons, his divine side kept introducing his human side into the struggle in such a way that it would win by means of its own power.<br />The secrets hidden in all this, however, are too manifold ever to describe. To put it briefly, the goodness and truth the Lord had that he used for weapons in his early battles were saturated with his mother's heredity. To the extent that his mother's heredity saturated them, they were not divine, but as he overcame evil and falsity they were gradually purified and became divine. </p>

And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim. That these signify so many kinds of apparent goods and truths, 
which in themselves are not goods and truths, that were in the Lord's external man, may be seen from the signification of all these in the internal sense, and also from what follows. For the Lord's combat 
against evils and falsities is treated of; here, His first combat, which took place in his childhood and earliest youth; which He then first engaged in and sustained when He had been imbued with 
knowledges [scientiae et cognitiones], on which account it is here said, "in the days of these."  [2] No one can ever fight against evils and falsities until he has learned to know what evil and falsity 
are, and therefore not until he has been instructed. A man does not know what evil is, still less what falsity is, until he has the full use of his understanding and judgment, which is the reason 
why a man does not come into temptations until he has arrived at adult age; thus every man in his age of manhood, but the Lord in His childhood.  [3] Every man combats first of all from the goods and 
truths he has received through knowledges; and from them and by them he judges about evils and falsities. Every man also, when he first begins to combat, supposes that the goods and truths from which 
he combats are his own; that is, he attributes them to himself, and at the same time attributes to himself the power by which he resists. This also is permitted; for the man cannot then know otherwise. 
Until a man has been regenerated, he cannot possibly know, so as to be able to say that he knows, acknowledges, and believes, that nothing of good and truth is from himself, but that all good and truth 
are from the Lord; or that he cannot resist any evil and falsity from his own power; for he does not know that evil spirits excite and infuse the evils and falsities; still less that by means of 
evil spirits he is in communication with hell; and that hell presses upon him as the sea does upon every part of a dike, which pressure of hell no man can possibly resist by his own powers. But as until 
he has been regenerated a man cannot but suppose that he resists by his own powers, this also is permitted; and thus he is introduced into combats or temptations; but afterwards he is more and more 
enlightened.  [4] When a man is in such a state that he supposes good and truth to be from himself, and that the power of resisting is his own, then the goods and truths from which he combats against 
evils and falsities are not goods and truths, although they appear so; for there is what is his own in them, and he places self-merit in victory, and glories as if it were he who had overcome the evil 
and falsity, when yet it is the Lord alone who combats and overcomes. That this is really the case, none can know but they who are being regenerated by means of temptations.  [5] And as in his earliest 
childhood the Lord was introduced into most grievous combats against evils and falsities, neither could He at that time suppose otherwise; and this not only because it was according to Divine order 
that His Human Essence should be introduced to the Divine Essence and be united to it by means of continual combats and victories, but also because the goods and truths from which He combated against 
evils and falsities were of the external man; and as these goods and truths were therefore not altogether Divine, they are therefore called appearances of good and truth. His Divine Essence introduced 
His Human in this manner, in order that it might overcome from its own power. But there are more arcana here than can possibly be described. In a word, in the first combats, the goods and truths 
in the Lord, from which he combated, were imbued with things inherited from the mother, and so far as they were imbued with things inherited from the mother, they were not Divine; but by degrees, as He 
overcame the evil and falsity, they were purified and made Divine. </p>

'And so it was in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim' means just so many kinds of apparent goods and truths which are not 
in themselves goods and truths, and which were present with the Lord's external Man. This becomes clear from the meaning of all these in the internal sense, and also from what follows. Far the subject 
is the Lord's conflict against evils and falsities, here His first conflict which came during His childhood and earliest adolescence. That conflict He first entered into and endured after He had been 
endowed with knowledge and cognitions, hence the expression 'in the days of' these kings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nobody can possibly fight against evils and falsities until he knows what evil and falsity are, not therefore 
until he has received instruction. A person does not know what evil is, still less what falsity is, before he is capable of understanding and of forming judgements for himself, which is the reason 
why a person does not enter into temptations until he has reached the age of maturity. Thus everyone is tempted in adult life, but the Lord was tempted even in childhood. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Everyone fights first 
of all from the goods and truths he has received by means of cognitions, and it is from them and by means of them that he forms judgements concerning evils and falsities Everyone furthermore when 
he first starts to fight imagines that these goods and truths from which he fights are his own, that is, he ascribes them to himself, and at the same time ascribes to himself the power by which he resists. 
This is allowed because a person cannot at the time know anything different. Before anyone has been regenerated he cannot possibly know, so as to be able to say that he knows, acknowledges, and 
believes, that no good or truth at all comes from self, but that everything good and true comes from the Lord; nor can he possibly know that he is unable by his own power to resist any evil or falsity. 
Indeed he does not know that evil spirits are activating and implanting the evils and falsities, still less that he is in communication with hell by means of evil spirits, and that hell presses on 
him like the sea against every part of a dike, which he can by no means resist by his own strength. Yet because he cannot do otherwise, until he has been regenerated, than imagine that he resists by his 
own strength, this too is permitted; and in this condition he is admitted into conflicts, or temptations. Subsequently however he becomes more and more enlightened. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 When a person's state is 
such that he imagines that good and truth originate in himself and that the power to resist is his own, the goods and truths from which he fights against evils and falsities are not really goods and truths, 
however much they appear to be so, for they have that which is his own within them, and he places self-merit in victory, boasting as though it were he that had overcome evil and falsity, when in 
fact it is the Lord alone who fights and overcomes. That this is indeed so none can know except those who are being regenerated by means of temptations. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Because the Lord in earliest childhood 
was led into very serious conflicts against evils and falsities it was inevitable that at that time even He should think that way. This happened both because it was according to Divine order that His 
Human Essence should through continuous conflicts and victories be brought to the Divine Essence and united to it, and because the goods and truths from which He fought against evils and falsities belonged 
to the External Man. And because those goods and truths were not completely Divine they are for that reason called appearances of good and truth. His Divine Essence brought the Human Essence to 
itself in this way in order that it might overcome by its own power. The arcana here however are more than can possibly be described. In short, in those first conflicts the goods and truths residing 
with the Lord from which He fought were permeated by things inherited from the mother, and insofar as they were permeated by things inherited from the mother they were not Divine. Gradually however, as 
He overcame evil and falsity they were purified and made Divine. </p>

'Et fuit in diebus Amraphelis regis Shinar, Ariochi regis Ellasar, Kedorlaomeri regis Elami, et Tidalis regis Goiim': quod significent totidem genera bonorum et verorum apparentium, quae in se non bona 
et vera sunt, apud Domini Externum Hominem, constare potest ab omnium horum significatione in sensu interno; tum a sequentibus; agitur enim de pugna Domini contra mala et falsa, hic de prima Ipsius 
pugna quae fuit in Ipsius pueritia et prima adolescentia; quam tunc primum iniit et sustinuit cum scientiis et cognitionibus imbutus fuit, quare hic dicitur in diebus horum.  [2] Nusquam aliquis pugnare 
potest contra mala et falsa priusquam novit quid malum et falsum, quare non priusquam instructus est; quid malum, non scit homo, minus quid falsum, antequam intellectu et judicio pollet, quae causa 
est quod homo in tentationes non veniat priusquam ad aetatem adultam venerit; sic omnis homo in aetate sua virili, Dominus autem in puerili: [3] omnis homo omnium primo pugnat ex bonis et veris quae 
per cognitiones accepit, et ex illis et per illa judicat de malis et falsis; omnis etiam homo cum primum incipit pugnare, putat bona illa et vera ex quibus pugnat, esse sua, hoc est, sibi tribuit illa, 
et simul sibi tribuit potentiam qua resistit; hoc quoque permittitur, nam homo tunc nihil aliud scire potest; antequam aliquis regeneratus est, nusquam scire potest, usque ut dicere possit quod norit, 
agnoscat et credat, quod nihil boni et veri a semet, sed omne bonum et verum a Domino; tum quod non ex propria potentia resistere alicui malo et falso possit; non enim novit quod spiritus mali excitent 
et infundant mala et falsa, minus quod per spiritus malos communicet cum inferno, et quod infernum ita incumbat, sicut mare solet singulis partibus aggeris, cui nequaquam homo potest suis viribus 
resistere; sed quia usque, antequam regeneratus est, non aliter putare potest quam quod suis viribus, etiam permittitur, et sic introducitur in pugnas seu in tentationes; postea autem magis et magis 
illustratur: [4] cum homo in tali statu est quod putet bonum et verum esse a semet et potentiam resistendi esse suam, tunc bona et vera ex quibus contra mala et falsa pugnat, non sunt bona et vera, 
tametsi ita apparent, nam proprium inest, et meritum sui ponit in victoria, et gloriatur sicut is vicerit malum et falsum, cum tamen Dominus solus est Qui pugnat et vincit; quod ita se res habeat, non 
scire possunt nisi illi qui per tentationes regenerantur. Dominus quia in prima pueritia in gravissimas [5] pugnas contra mala et falsa introductus est, nec aliter tunc potuit autumare, et hoc tam quia 
secundum ordinem Divinum fuit ut Essentia Ipsius Humana per continuas pugnas et victorias introduceretur ad Essentiam Divinam et Ipsi uniretur, quam quod bona et vera ex quibus pugnavit contra mala 
et falsa, Externi Hominis essent; et quia bona et vera illa non sic fuerunt prorsus Divina, quare vocantur apparentia boni et veri: Divina Ipsius Essentia ita introducebat Humanam ut ex propria potentia 
vinceret: sed arcana hic plura sunt quam ut usquam describi queant; verbo, in primis pugnis fuerunt bona et vera apud Dominum ex quibus pugnavit, imbuta hereditariis ex matre, et quantum imbuta hereditariis 
ex matre, tantum non Divina fuerunt, sed per gradus, ut evicit malum et falsum, purificata sunt et facta Divina. </p>
