Verses 27-31. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had a possession therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen 
years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years, and a hundred and forty years. And the days of Israel drew near to die; and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I 
pray I have found grace in thine eyes, put I pray thy hand under my thigh, and do mercy and truth with me; bury me not I pray in Egypt; and I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of 
Egypt, and bury me in their sepulcher. And he said, I will do according to thy word. And he said, Swear to me; and he sware to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. "And Israel dwelt in the 
land of Egypt," signifies that spiritual good lived among the memory-knowledges which are of the church; "in the land of Goshen," signifies in the midst of them; "and they had a possession therein," 
signifies given and set in order in this way by the internal; "and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly," signifies the derivative goods of charity and truths of faith; "and Jacob lived in the land 
of Egypt," signifies that the truth of the natural was in memory-knowledges; "seventeen years," signifies the state therein; "and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years, and a 
hundred and forty years," signifies the general state and its quality; "and the days of Israel drew near to die," signifies the state immediately before regeneration; "and he called his son Joseph," signifies 
the presence of the internal; "and said to him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes," signifies longing; "put I pray thy hand under my thigh," signifies a sacred binding; "and do mercy 
and truth with me," signifies humiliation; "bury me not I pray in Egypt," signifies regeneration not in memory-knowledges; "and I will lie with my fathers," signifies life such as the ancients had; "and 
thou shalt carry me out of Egypt," signifies that there may be elevation out of memory-knowledges; "and bury me in their sepulcher," signifies such regeneration; "and he said, I will do according 
to thy word," signifies that so it shall be done of providence by the Divine; "and he said, Swear to me," signifies that it may be irrevocable; "and he sware to him," signifies that it was irrevocable; 
"and Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head," signifies that he turned to those things which are of the interior natural. </p>

Verses 27-31 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had a possession in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen 
years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years. And Israel's days drew near when he must die; and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have 
found favour in your eyes, put now your hand under my thigh, and show me mercy and truth;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> do not beg you, bury me in Egypt. And let me lie with my fathers, and you are to carry me out of Egypt, and 
to bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to your word. And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself over the head of the bed. </p>
<p>'And Israel dwelt in 
the land of Egypt' means that spiritual good lived among the facts known to the Church. 'In the land of Goshen' means in the middle of them. 'And they had a possession in it' means given and set in order 
thus by the internal. 'And were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly' means resulting forms of the good of charity and resulting truths of faith. 'And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt' means the truth 
of the natural existing among known facts. 'Seventeen years means the state there. 'And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years means the state in general and 
its essential nature. 'And Israel's days drew near when he must die' means the state immediately before regeneration. 'And he called his son Joseph' means the presence of the internal. 'And said to 
him, If now I have found favour in your eyes' means a desire. 'Put now your hand under my thigh' means a sacred bond. 'And show me mercy and truth' means humility. 'Do not, I beg you, bury me in Egypt' 
means regeneration not among known facts. 'And let me lie with my fathers' means life such as the ancients possessed. 'And you are to carry me out of Egypt' means so that there may be a raising up 
from factual knowledge. 'And to bury me in their sepulchre' means that kind of regeneration. 'And he said, I will do according to your word' means that it will indeed be done, for which the Divine has 
provided. 'And he said, Swear to me' means so that no change can be made. 'And he swore to him' means that no change can be made. 'And Israel bowed himself over the head of the bed' means that it turned 
towards things of the interior natural.

Vers. 27-31.  Et habitavit Israel in terra Aegypti, in terra Goshen, et possessionem habuerunt in illa; et fructificarunt se, et multiplicati valde.  Et vixit Jacob in terra Aegypti septendecim annis; 
et fuit dies Jacobi anni vitae {1}ejus septem anni et quadraginta et centum anni.  Et appropinquarunt dies Israelis ad moriendum, et vocavit filium suum Josephum, et dixit ei, Si quaeso inveni gratiam 
in oculis tuis, pone quaeso manum tuam sub femore meo, et facias mecum misericordiam et veritatem, ne quaeso sepelias me in Aegypto.  Et cubem cum patribus meis, et feras me ex Aegypto, et sepelias 
me in sepulcro illorum; et dixit, Ego faciam secundum verbum tuum.  Et dixit, Jura mihi; et juravit ei; et incurvavit se Israel super caput lecti. `Et habitavit Israel in terra Aegypti' significat quod 
bonum spirituale viveret inter scientifica  quae Ecclesiae: `in terra Goshen' significat in medio eorum:  `et  possessionem habuerunt in illa' significat datum et ordinatum ita  ab interno: `et fructificarunt 
se, et multiplicati valde' significat inde bona charitatis et vera fidei:  `et vixit Jacob in terra Aegypti' significat  verum naturalis quod in scientificis: `septendecim annis' significat 
statum ibi: `et fuit dies Jacobi anni vitae illius, septem anni et quadraginta et centum anni' significat statum communem et quale ejus: et appropinquarunt dies Israelis ad moriendum' significat statum 
mox ante regenerationem: `et vocavit filium suum Josephum' significat praesentiam interni: `et dixit ei, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis' significat desiderium: `pone quaeso manum tuam sub 
femore meo' significat obstrictionem sanctam: `et facias mecum misericordiam et veritatem' significat humiliationem: `ne quaeso sepelias me in Aegypto' significat regenerationem non in scientificis: 
`et cubem cum patribus meis' significat vitam qualis antiquis: `et feras me ex Aegypto' significat ut sit elevatio ex scientificis: `et sepelias me in sepulcro illorum' significat talem regenerationem: 
 `et dixit, Ego faciam secundum verbum tuum' significat quod ita fiet ex providentia a Divino: `et dixit, Jura mihi' significat ut irrevocabile sit: `et juravit ei'  significat quod irrevocabile; `et 
incurvavit se Israel super caput lecti'   significat quod se verteret ad illa quae sunt interioris naturalis.  @1 thus I here, but illius below and 6175$ </p>
