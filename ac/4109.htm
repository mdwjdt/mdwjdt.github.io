Verses 19-21. And Laban was gone to shear his flock; and Rachel stole the teraphim which were her father's. And Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Aramean, in that he told him not that he was fleeing. 
And he fled, he and all that he had; and he arose and passed over the river, and set his faces toward the mountain of Gilead. "And Laban was gone to shear his flock," signifies a state of use and of 
an end of good, which is the "flock of Laban;" "and Rachel stole the teraphim which were her father's," signifies a change of the state signified by Laban in respect to truth; "and Jacob stole the heart 
of Laban the Aramean," signifies a change of the state signified by Laban in respect to good ("Laban the Aramean" here denotes as before such good as does not contain Divine truth and good); "in that 
he told him not that he was fleeing," signifies by the separation; "and he fled, he and all that he had," signifies separation; "and he arose," signifies elevation; "and passed over the river," signifies 
a state wherein is conjunction; "and set his faces toward the mountain of Gilead," signifies good therein. </p>

Verses 19-21 And Laban had gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stole the teraphim which belonged to her father. And Jacob stole the heart<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Laban the Aramean by not giving him any indication that he 
was fleeing. And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and crossed the river; and he set his face towards mount Gilead. </p>
<p>'Laban had gone to shear his flock' means a state of use and of an end 
in view involving the good meant by 'Laban's flock'. 'And Rachel stole the teraphim which belonged to her father' means a change, as regards truth, of the state meant by 'Laban'. 'And Jacob stole the 
heart of Laban the Aramean' means a change, as regards good, of the state meant by 'Laban' - 'Laban the Aramean' meaning, as previously, a type of good which does not include Divine Truth and Good. 
'By not giving him any indication that he was fleeing' means through the separation. 'And he fled with all that he had' means separation. 'And he rose up' means a raising up. 'And crossed the river' 
means a state in which a joining together takes place. 'And he set his face towards mount Gilead' means good within it.

Vers. 19-21.  Et Laban iverat ad tondendum gregem suum, et furata Rachel teraphim qui patri suo.  Et furatus Jacob cor.  Labanis Aramaei, per quod non indicavit ei, quod fugiens is.  Et fugit is, 
et omne quod ei, et surrexit, et transivit fluvium, et posuit facies suas montem Gilead.  `Laban iverat ad tondendum gregem suum' significat statum usus et finis boni quod `grex Labanis': `et furata 
Rachel teraphim qui patri suo' significat mutationem status per `Labanem {1}' significati, quoad verum: `et furatus Jacob cor Labanis Aramaei' significat mutationem status per `Labanem {1}' significati, 
quoad bonum; `Laban Aramaeus' est bonum tale in quo non Divinum Verum et Bonum, ut prius: `per quod non indicavit ei, quod fugiens is' significat per separationem: [`et fugit is, et omne quod 
ei' significat separationem]: `et surrexit' significat elevationem: `et transivit fluvium' significat statum ubi conjunctio: `et posuit facies suas montem Gilead' significat bonum ibi.      @1 Laban$ </p>
