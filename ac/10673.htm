<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10673节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10673</strong>.出埃及记34:24-27.我要从你面前赶出列族，扩张你的疆界；你一年三次上去朝见耶和华你神的面时，必没有人贪慕你的地。你不可将我祭牲的血和有酵之物一同献上；逾越节的祭物也不可过夜留到早晨。土地里首先初熟之物，要送到耶和华你神的家。不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔。耶和华对摩西说，你要将这些话写上；因为我是按这话与你和以色列立约的。<br />“我要从你面前赶出列族”表将邪恶和邪恶的虚假移开。“扩张你的疆界”表源于良善的真理的增多和延伸。“必没有人贪慕你的地”表那些沉浸于邪恶和邪恶的虚假之人对诸如属于教会的那类事物的厌恶。“你一年三次上去朝见耶和华你神的面时”表当主也同在于信之真理时。“你不可将我祭牲的血和有酵之物一同献上”表由教会的真理所产生的对主的敬拜必不与由邪恶所产生的虚假混在一起。“逾越节的祭物也不可过夜留到早晨”表并非来源于自我，而是来自主并且总是新的敬拜的良善。“土地里首先初熟之物，要送到耶和华你神的家”表一切良善之真理和一切真理之良善都是神圣的，因为它们唯独来自主。“不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔”表属于后一种状态的纯真之良善决不可与属于前一种状态的纯真之真理相混和。“耶和华对摩西说，你要将这些话写上”表关于必须要记住并行出来的首要真理的指示。“因为我是按这话与你和以色列立约的”表通过这些真理而与那些处于外在和内在敬拜的人结合。</p>

Verses 24-27. Because I drive out nations from thy faces, and I will enlarge thy border; and no one shall covet thy land, when thou goest up to see the faces of Jehovah thy God three times in the year. 
Thou shalt not slay the blood of My sacrifice upon what is leavened; and the sacrifice of the feast of the passover shall not stay all night unto the morning. The firstfruits of the first things of 
thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write for thee these words; because upon the mouth of these 
words I make a covenant with thee and with Israel. "Because I drive out nations from before thy faces," signifies the removal of evil and of the falsities of evil; "and I will enlarge thy border," 
signifies the multiplication and extension of truth from good; "and no one shall covet thy land," signifies aversion for such things as are of the church on the part of those who are in evils and the 
falsities of evil; "when thou goest up to see the faces of Jehovah thy God three times in the year," signifies when the presence of the Lord is in the truths of faith also; "thou shalt not slay the blood 
of My sacrifice upon what is leavened," signifies that the worship of the Lord from the truths of the church must not be commingled with falsities from evil; "and the sacrifice of the feast of the 
passover shall not stay all night unto the morning," signifies the good of worship not from man's own, but from the Lord always new; "the firstfruits of the first things of thy ground thou shalt bring 
into the house of Jehovah thy God," signifies that all the truths of good and goods of truth are holy, because they are from the Lord alone; "thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk," signifies 
that the good of innocence of an after state must not be commingled with the truth of innocence of a former state; "and Jehovah said unto Moses, Write for thee these words," signifies information 
about the primary truths that must be remembered and done; "because upon the mouth of these words I make a covenant with thee and with Israel," signifies that by means of them there is conjunction with 
those who are in external and internal worship. </p>

Verses 24-27  For I will drive out the nations from [before] your face and cause your borders to be enlarged; and no one will covet your land when you go up to see the face of<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Jehovah your God three 
times in the year. You shall not offer<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> the blood of My sacrifice with anything made from yeast; and the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not remain through the night until morning. The 
firstfruits of the first things of your ground you are to bring to the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk. And Jehovah said to Moses, Write these words; for in accordance 
with<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> these words I make a covenant with you and with Israel. </p>
<p>'For I will drive out the nations from [before] your face' means shifting evil and the falsities of evil away. 'And cause your 
borders to be enlarged' means the multiplication and increase in the range of truth that springs from good. 'And no one will covet your land' means a loathing of such things as belong to the Church 
on the part of those steeped in evils and the falsities of evil. 'When you go up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times in the year' means when the Lord is present in the truths of faith as 
well. 'You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything made from yeast' means that worship of the Lord arising from the Church's truths must not be mingled together with falsities arising 
from evil. 'And the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not remain through the night until morning' means the good of worship, which does not originate in the self but comes from the Lord and 
is always new. 'The firstfruits of the first things of your ground you are to bring to the house of Jehovah your God' means that every truth of good and every good of truth is holy because it comes from 
the Lord alone. 'You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk' means that the good of innocence belonging to a later state must not be mingled with the truth of innocence belonging to an earlier 
state. 'And Jehovah said to Moses, Write these words' means instructions regarding the leading truths that are to be remembered and done. 'For in accordance with these words I make a covenant with you 
and with Israel' means being joined through these truths to those whose worship is outward and inward.

Vers. 24-27.  Quia expello gentes  a faciebus tuis, et dilatari faciam terminum tuum, et non concupiscet quisquam terram tuam in ascendendo te ad videndum facies Jehovae Dei tui tribus vicibus in anno. 
 Non mactabis super fermentato sanguinem sacrificii Mei, et non pernoctabit ad mane sacrificium festi Paesach.  Primitias primitivorum humi tuae inducas domum Jehovae Dei tui.  Non elixabis haedum 
in lacte matris suae.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Scribe tibi verba illa, quia super ore verborum illorum pango cum te foedus, et cum Israele.  `Quia expello gentes a faciebus tuis' significat remotionem 
mali et falsorum mali:  `et dilatari faciam terminum tuum' significat multiplicationem et extensionem veri ex bono:  `et non concupiscet quisquam terram tuam' significat aversationem talium quae 
Ecclesiae apud illos qui in malis et falsis mali sunt: `in ascendendo te ad videndum facies Jehovae Dei tui tribus vicibus in anno' significat quando praesentia Domini etiam in veris fidei: `non mactabis 
super fermentato sanguinem sacrificii Mei' significat quod cultus Domini ex veris Ecclesiae non commiscendus sit cum falsis ex malo:  `et non pernoctabit ad mane sacrificium festi Paesach' significat 
bonum cultus non ex proprio, sed ex Domino semper novum:  `primitias primitivorum humi tuae inducas domum Jehovae Dei tui' significat quod omnia vera boni et bona veri sancta sint quia a solo Domino: 
 `non elixabis haedum in lacte matris suae' significat quod bonum innocentiae posterioris status non commiscendum sit cum vero innocentiae prioris status:  `et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Scribe tibi 
verba illa' significat informationem de primariis veris quae reminiscenda et facienda:  `quia super ore verborum illorum pango cum te foedus, et cum Israel' significat quod per illa conjunctio cum 
illis qui in cultu externo et interno. </p>
