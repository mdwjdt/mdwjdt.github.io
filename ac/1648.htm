<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1648.</strong>在善灵和天使灵中还有一种很多人同时说话的言语形式，尤其在圈子里或唱诗班中。对此，蒙主怜悯，以后再予以描述。我经常听到唱诗班所用的这种言语；它具有一种仿佛有节奏的韵律。他们根本不思想话语或观念，因为他们的感情自发流入其中。没有任何话语或观念会流入使感觉增多，或将其引到其它方向的事物，或人造之物所粘附的事物，或具有一种在他们看来源于自我或我欲的优雅之物中。所有这类事物都会立刻造成干扰，破坏这种自发性。他们的心思并不拘泥于任何话语，他们只思想感觉；这些话会从感觉本身自发而来。他们以一种和谐，并且通常很简单的处置方式结束一段经文；但当以一种复杂的处置方式结束时，他们会通过改变音高而转入下一段。这些模式是他们在社团中思维和言谈的产物，因此，这种言语所采取的形式具有一种韵律，这种韵律取决于该社团的联合方式和团结一致。歌曲的形式曾经是这样；大卫诗篇也是如此。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1648.</strong> Good spirits and angelic spirits have a way of speaking all together in large numbers, particularly in circle choirs or choruses. (I will have more to say on these later [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2294" target=_top>2294</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2595" target=_top>2595-2596</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3350" target=_top>3350-3351</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3893" target=_top>3893</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5173" target=_top>5173:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5181" target=_top>5181-5183</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1648/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8115" target=_top>8115</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.) Their choral speech I have heard quite often. It has a rhythmic flow to it. They do not think at all about the words or concepts, which their meaning pours into without effort. No words or concepts that complicate the sense or distract the listener ever inject themselves. Neither do any that have an artificial feel, or that seem to them to display a vain, self-flattering elegance. Such faults would immediately disturb them. They never fixate on a word but consider only the meaning. Words are the natural consequences of the meaning itself. The spirits end in unison, and usually a single unison. When the ending is more elaborate, intonation carries them from one unison to the next.<br />These traits arise from the fact that the spirits think and talk in concert. So they have a smooth-flowing style of speech that results from the interconnections in their community and the unanimity of it. This was the style of ancient songs, and it is the style of the Psalms of David. </p>

There is a speech of good spirits, and also of angelic spirits, which is a simultaneous speech of many, especially in circles or choirs, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. The speech 
in choirs has often been heard by me; it has a cadence [labens], as if in rhythm. They have no thought about the words or ideas, for into these their sentiments flow spontaneously. No words or ideas 
flow in which multiply the sense, or draw it away to something else, or to which anything artificial adheres, or that seems to them elegant from self, or from self-love, for such things would at once 
cause disturbance. They do not inhere in any word; they think of the sense; the words follow spontaneously from the sense itself. They come to a close in unities, for the most part simple; but when 
in those which are compound, they turn by an accent to the next. These things are the result of their thinking and speaking in society; hence the form of the speech has a cadence in accordance with the 
connection and unanimity of the society. Such was once the form of songs; and such is that of the Psalms of David. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1648</b></p><p><b>1648.</b>
There is also a form of speech among good spirits and among angelic spirits in which many speak simultaneously, especially in gyres or choirs, which will be described in the Lord's Divine mercy later 
on I have often heard this speech expressed by those choirs; it has a cadence that sounds rhythmic. They give no thought at all to words or ideas; their feelings flow spontaneously into these. No word 
or idea enters in which multiplies the meaning, or takes it in another direction, or to which anything artificial is attached, or which has an elegance that is seen by them to originate in self or self-love 
- all of which things would instantly destroy the spontaneity. These choirs do not fix their minds on any word; their thoughts are on the sense, and their words follow spontaneously from this. 
They end a passage together in a harmonious and usually simple resolution; and when they end in a complex resolution they move on to the next passage by a change of pitch. These patterns are the product 
of their thinking and speaking in association, as a consequence of which the form that this speech takes has a cadence that is determined by the manner of association and the unity of the group Songs 
took this form in the past, and so do the Psalms of David. </p>

</p><b>1648.</b>
Est loquela spirituum bonorum et spirituum angelicorum, simultanea plurium, cumprimis in gyris seu choris, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; quae in choris, saepius mihi audita; 
est labens sicut rhythmica; nihil cogitant de vocibus aut ideis; sensa sponte fluunt in illas; nullae voces aut ideae influunt quae sensum multiplicant aut aliunde abstrahunt, et quibus adhaeret aliquid 
artificiale, aut quod elegans sibi videtur ex se aut ex sui amore quae ilico disturbarent; nulli voci inhaerent, cogitant sensum, voces sunt spontaneae ipsius sensus sequelae; desinunt in unitates, 
utplurimum simplices; dum in compositas, per accentum volvunt ac in sequentem: haec inde veniunt quia in societate cogitant et loquuntur, inde forma loquelae secundum societatis connexionem et unanimitatem 
labens: talis forma canticorum olim fuit, et talis est Psalmorum Davidis. </p>
