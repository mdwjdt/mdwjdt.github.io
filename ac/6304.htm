<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6304节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6304.</strong>“领你们回到你们列祖之地”表回到这两个古教会的状态。这从“地”和“列祖”的含义清楚可知：“地”是指教会（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>节）；“列祖”是指那些属于古教会和上古教会的人（<a href="6075.htm">6075</a>节）。之所以说“回到这两个古教会的状态”，是因为以色列的儿子们及其后代，就像两个古教会的成员一样，要在每一个细节上代表主的属天和属灵国度。代表本身也得以建立；在犹太民族当中，建立了属天国度的代表；在以色列人当中，建立了属灵国度的代表。但在这一代当中，教会或主国度的东西无法得以建立，只能建立一种纯粹的代表；因为他们只想在代表中看见并承认外在之物，根本不想看见并承认任何内在之物。<br />然而，为叫一种大体的代表能得以存在，通过它与天堂，并通过天堂与主的某种交流也得以存在，他们被保持在外在；那时，主规定：交流要通过一种缺乏任何内在的纯粹的外在代表进行。这就是雅各的后代们能被带回的状态；然而，在这些后代当中的外在代表内在却隐藏着神性事物，在至高意义上隐藏着与主的神性人身有关的事物，在相对意义上隐藏着与主的天国并教会有关的事物。两个古教会的这种状态由这句话来表示：“神必领你们回到你们列祖之地”。</p>

And shall bring you back unto the land of your fathers. That this signifies to the state of both Ancient Churches, is evident from the signification of "land," as being the church (see n. 566, 662, 1066, 
1067, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535, 4447, 5577); and from the signification of "fathers," as being the men of the Ancient and Most Ancient Churches (n. 6075). It is said "to the state of both 
Ancient Churches," because the sons of Israel and their descendants, like those who belonged to the Ancient Churches, in every particular represented the Lord's kingdom, celestial and spiritual. The 
representative itself was also instituted; with the Jewish nation that of the celestial kingdom, and with the Israelitish that of the spiritual kingdom; but with that generation nothing but a mere representative 
could be instituted, and not anything of the church or kingdom of the Lord; for they desired to see and acknowledge in the representatives absolutely nothing but what was external, and not 
anything internal. Nevertheless in order that there might exist a representative, and thereby some communication with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, they were kept in externals; and it was 
then provided by the Lord that communication should exist by means of a mere external representative without an internal. This was the state to which the descendants of Jacob could be brought back; 
nevertheless in their external representatives there lay inwardly hidden Divine things; in the highest sense such as regarded the Lord's Divine Human; and in the relative sense such as regarded the Lord's 
kingdom in the heavens, and the church. This state of both Ancient Churches is signified by the words, "God shall bring you back unto the land of your fathers." </p>

'And will bring you back to the land of your fathers' means to the state of both Ancient Churches. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>; and from the meaning of 'fathers' as those who belonged to the Ancient Church and the Most Ancient Church, dealt with in <a href="6075.htm">6075</a>. To the state of both Ancient 
Churches is said to be meant because the sons of Israel and their descendants, like members of the Ancient Churches, were to represent in specific detail the Lord's celestial and spiritual kingdom. That 
representation was actually established - among the Jewish nation a representation of the celestial kingdom, and among the Israelite people a representation of the spiritual kingdom. But with that 
generation nothing of the Church or of the Lord's kingdom could be established, only what was a mere representation, for they wished to see and acknowledge in representatives only what was external, and 
nothing at all internal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 However, so that the overall representation might be effected, and through it some communication with heaven might exist, and through heaven with the Lord, they were 
restricted to externals; and at that time the Lord saw to it that communication might take place through external representation alone devoid of any internal. This was the state to which Jacob's descendants 
could be 'brought back'. Yet inwardly, external representatives among those descendants concealed Divine matters, in the highest sense those which had regard to the Lord's Divine Human, and in 
the relative sense those which had regard to the Lord's kingdom in heaven and to the Church. This state of both Ancient Churches is what is meant by the promise that God will bring them back to the land 
of their fathers. </p>

(x)  `Et reducet vos ad terram patrum vestrorum':  quod significet ad statum Ecclesiae utriusque Antiquae, constat a significatione `terrae' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1733, 1850, 
2117, 2118, 3355, 4535, 4447, 5577; et ex significatione `patrum' quod sint illi qui ab Ecclesia Antiqua et ab Ecclesia Antiquissima, de qua n. 6075.  Ad statum Ecclesiae utriusque Antiquae dicitur 
quia filii Israelis et horum posteri, sicut illi qui ab Antiquis Ecclesiis, in singulis repraesentarent regnum Domini caeleste et spirituale; ipsum repraesentativum etiam institutum fuit apud gentem 
Judaicam repraesentativum regni caelestis et apud {1}populum Israeliticum repraesentativum regni spiritualis; sed apud generationem illam non potuit aliud quam merum repraesentativum institui, non autem 
aliquid Ecclesiae aut regni Domini, nam prorsus nihil in repraesentativis videre et agnoscere voluerunt quam externum, non autem aliquod internum; [2] ut tamen repraesentativum existeret, et per 
id aliqua communicatio daretur cum caelo et per caelum cum Domino, tenebantur in externis; et provisum tunc erat a Domino ut communicatio daretur per {2}solum repraesentativum externum absque interno; 
his status erat ad quem reduci potuerunt posteri Jacobi; at usque in repraesentativis externis apud illos intus latuerunt Divina, in supremo sensu quae spectabant Divinum Humanum Domini, et in sensu 
respectivo, quae spectabant regnum {3}Domini in caelis et Ecclesiam; hic status utriusque Ecclesiae Antiquae significatur per quod `Deus reducet eos ad terram patrum eorum'. @1 gentem Israeliticam$ @2
