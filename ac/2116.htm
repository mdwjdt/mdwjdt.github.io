<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2116.</strong>“也都同他一起受了割礼”表他们因主称义。这从“割礼”的含义清楚可知，“割礼”代表并因此表示被洁净（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）。他们“同他（即亚伯拉罕）一起受了割礼”也是一种代表行为，也就是说，被洁净并由此称义的行为。但公义的情形并不象人们通常所想的那样。他们以为，只要人成为信徒，即便在生命的最后一刻，不管他们一生中是否犯罪，是否有过可耻行为，一切罪恶都会被擦去，并完全被抹除。然而，我已得到充分指教，人在肉身生活时所思想并做出的一切罪恶，哪怕最小的，都不会被擦去，并完全被抹除，反而全都保留下来，直至最小细节。<br />真相是：对那些曾思想并实施过仇恨、报复、残忍、奸淫行为，并由此过着不仁爱的生活之人而言，死后，他们在如此行的过程中所获取的生命会降临到他们身上，并逐渐重现。对他们来说，这就是地狱折磨的源头。但对那些生活在对主之爱和对邻之仁中的人而言，其生命的罪恶也全都保留下来；不过，这些罪恶会被他们在世时凭仁爱的生活从主那里所接受的良善调和，他们由此被举升天堂。事实上，他们从与他们同在的恶中退离，以致这些恶不再显现。在来世，人若对自己身上的罪恶持怀疑态度（因为它们没有显现出来），就会被带回这些罪恶，直到他们认识到这是千真万确的事实为止。然后，他们被再次举升天堂。<br />这就是称义所表示的，因为人们以这种方式逐渐承认主的公义，而非自己的公义。人们说，凡有信的人就会得救，他们说的是实话。但是，在圣言中，“信”是指对主之爱和对邻之仁，因而是指源于这些爱的生活，并非指别的东西。教义和信条属于信，但并非信。因为这些东西的每一个及全部，都是为了人能变成诸如它们所教导的样子而存在。这从主的话清楚看出来，即爱神并爱邻如己构成一切律法和一切先知，即构成信的整个教义（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.34.htm">22:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.39.htm">39</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.28.htm">12:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.35.htm">35</a>）。其它信并非正信，也不可能存在，这在第一卷已经说明（<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="379.htm">379</a>，<a href="389.htm">389</a>，<a href="724.htm">724</a>，<a href="809.htm">809</a>，<a href="896.htm">896</a>，<a href="904.htm">904</a>，<a href="916.htm">916</a>，<a href="989.htm">989</a>，<a href="1017.htm">1017</a>，<a href="1076.htm">1076</a>，<a href="1077.htm">1077</a>，<a href="1121.htm">1121</a>，<a href="1158.htm">1158</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>，<a href="1176.htm">1176</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>，<a href="1285.htm">1285</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1608.htm">1608</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="1799.htm">1799</a>，<a href="1834.htm">1834</a>，<a href="1843.htm">1843</a>，<a href="1844.htm">1844</a>节）；天堂本身就在于爱主和相爱（<a href="537.htm">537</a>，<a href="547.htm">547</a>，<a href="553.htm">553</a>，<a href="1112.htm">1112</a>，<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>节）。</p>

That they "were circumcised by [ab] him" signifies that they are justified by the Lord, may be seen from the representation and thence the signification of "being circumcised," as being to be purified 
(explained above, n. 2039). Their "being circumcised by him," that is, by Abraham, was also representative, namely, that they are purified and thereby justified by the Lord. But in regard to justification, 
the case is not as is commonly supposed, namely, that all evils and sins are wiped away and utterly blotted out when men, as they imagine, believe-even if it were their last and dying hour-however 
they may have lived in evils and in misdeeds during the entire course of their lives; for I have been fully instructed that not the smallest evil which a man during his bodily life has thought and 
has carried out into act is wiped away and utterly blotted out; but that it all remains, even to the very least of it.  [2] The truth is that with those who have meditated and practiced acts of hatred, 
of revenge, of cruelty, and of adultery, and who thereby have lived in no charity, the life thence contracted awaits them after death, nay, so do all things of that life both in general and in particular, 
which return in succession; and from this comes their torment in hell. But with those who have lived in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, their evils of life also all remain, 
but they are tempered by the goods which during their life in the world they have received from the Lord by means of a life of charity; and thereby they are uplifted into heaven, nay, are withheld 
from the evils which they have appertaining to them, so that these do not appear. They who in the other life doubt their having evils with them, because the evils do not appear, are let into them until 
they know that the case is really so, and then are again uplifted into heaven.  [3] This then is what is meant by being justified; for in this way men come to acknowledge not their own righteousness, 
but that of the Lord. As to its being said that those are saved who have faith-this is true; but in the Word by "faith" nothing else is meant than love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, 
and thus a life from these loves. The doctrinal things and dogmas of faith are not faith, but belong to faith; for they are one and all for the sake of the end that a man may become such as they teach 
him to be, as may be clearly seen from the Lord's words that in love to God and love toward the neighbor consist all the law and the prophets, that is, the universal doctrine of faith (Matt. 22:34-39; 
Mark 12:28-35). (That there cannot possibly be any other faith that is faith, was shown in Part First, n. 30-38, 379, 389, 724, 809, 896, 904, 916, 989, 1017, 1076, 1077, 1121, 1158, 1162, 1176, 1258, 
1285, 1316, 1608, 1798, 1799, 1834, 1843, 1844; and also that heaven itself consists in love to the Lord and in mutual love, n. 537, 547, 553, 1112, 2057.) </p>

That 'were circumcised by him' means that they were made righteous by the Lord becomes clear from the representation and consequently from the meaning of 'being circumcised' as being purified, dealt 
with above in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>. 'Being circumcised by him' - that is, by Abraham - was also a representative act, that is to say, an act of being purified and so of being made righteous by the Lord. As regards righteousness 
however, the position is not as people commonly suppose. They imagine that all evils and sins are washed away and completely abolished when people become believers, even if they become such 
only in their last hour before they die, no matter whether they have committed evil and disgraceful actions throughout the whole course of their lives. I have been fully informed however that not even 
the smallest evil a person has thought and carried out during his lifetime is washed away and completely abolished, but that everything remains right down to the smallest detail. </p>

 The truth of 
the matter is that in the case of people who have thought and practiced acts of hatred, revenge, cruelty, and adultery, and so have not led charitable lives, the life they have acquired in so doing 
awaits them after death. Indeed every single facet of that life awaits them and gradually reappears. This for them is the source of torment in hell. But in the case of people who have led lives of love 
to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbour all their evils of life await them also; but these are moderated by the goods which they have received from the Lord through the life of charity during 
their lifetime, and in this condition they are raised up into heaven. Indeed they are withheld from the evils which they have with them so that these do not show themselves. People in the next life 
who doubt that they have evils with them because they do not show themselves are brought back into those evils until they know that it really is so. After that they are raised once more into heaven. </p>

This then is what being made righteous entails, for in this way people come to acknowledge not their own righteousness but the Lord's. When people say that those are saved who have faith, they 
are saying something that is true; but in the Word nothing else is meant by faith than love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and so a life that is derived from those loves. Matters of doctrine 
and established beliefs do not constitute faith yet are part of faith, for these, each and every one, exist to the end that a person may become such as they teach. This becomes quite clear from 
the Lord's words about all the Law and all the Prophets, that is, the doctrine of faith in its entirety., consisting in love to God and love towards the neighbour, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:35-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:35-40</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:28-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:28-35</a>. The 
fact that no other kind of faith which is truly faith can possibly, exist has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="379.htm">379</a>, <a href="389.htm">389</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a>, <a href="809.htm">809</a>, <a href="896.htm">896</a>, <a href="904.htm">904</a>, <a href="916.htm">916</a>, <a href="989.htm">989</a>, <a href="1017.htm">1017</a>, <a href="1076.htm">1076</a>, <a href="1077.htm">1077</a>, <a href="1121.htm">1121</a>, <a href="1158.htm">1158</a>, <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, <a href="1176.htm">1176</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>, <a href="1285.htm">1285</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="1608.htm">1608</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="1799.htm">1799</a>, <a href="1834.htm">1834</a>, <a href="1843.htm">1843</a>, <a href="1844.htm">1844</a>, and that heaven itself consists in love to the Lord and in mutual love, in <a href="537.htm">537</a>, <a href="547.htm">547</a>, <a href="553.htm">553</a>, <a href="1112.htm">1112</a>, <a href="2057.htm">2057</a>. </p>

Quod `circumcisi sunt ab illo' significet quod justificati sint a Domino, constare potest a repraesentatione et inde significatione `circumcidi' quod sit purificari, de qua supra n. 2039 quod `circumcisi 
ab illo,' hoc est, ab Abrahamo, etiam repraesentativum fuit, nempe quod purificati et sic justificati a Domino.  Quod autem justificationem attinet, illa (t)se non habet secundum vulgarem opinionem, 
nempe quod omnia mala et peccata sint abstersa et prorsus deleta, quando, sicut  {1} opinantur, credunt, etiamsi hoc foret in ultima mortis hora, utcumque per integrum vitae suae cursum in malis 
et flagitiis vixerunt; plene enim instructus sum quod ne quidem minimum malum quod homo cogitavit et actualiter fecit in vita corporis, abstergatur et prorsus deleatur, sed quod omne remaneat usque ad 
minimum ejus; [2] verum ita se habet: qui odia, vindictas, crudelitates et adulteria cogitarunt et exercuerunt, ac ita in nulla charitate vixerunt, vita inde tracta manet eos post mortem, immo omnia 
et singula vitae istius, quae {2} successive redeunt; inde cruciatus eorum in inferno: at qui in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum vixerunt, illorum mala vitae etiam omnia manent, (m)sed 
temperantur bonis quae per vitam charitatis dum vixerunt in mundo, acceperunt a Domino, et sic elevantur in caelum, immo detinentur a malis quae secum habent sic ut non appareant; qui de eo dubitant in 
altera vita quod mala secum habeant, quia non apparent, remittuntur in illa, usque dum sciant quod ita se res habeat, et dein rursus in caelum elevantur;(n) [3] hoc nunc est justificari; sic enim (t)non 
justitiam sui sed justitiam Domini agnoscunt: quod dicant salvari eos qui fidem habent, hoc verum est, sed per fidem in Verbo nihil aliud intelligitur quam amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum, 
ita vita inde; doctrinalia et dogmata fidei non sunt fides sed fidei {3}, nam omnia et singula sunt propter finem ut talis fiat homo sicut docent, quod manifeste {4} constare potest (c)a Domini verbis, 
quod in amore in Deum, et in amore erga proximum, [omnis] Lex et omnes Prophetae, hoc est, universa doctrina fidei, consistat, Matth. xxii 34-39; Marc. xii 28-35: quod nusquam alia fides quae fides,
