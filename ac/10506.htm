<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10506节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10506</strong>.“耶和华对摩西说，谁得罪我，我就从我的册上涂抹谁”表答复，即那些背离神性的人不会被毁灭。这从“耶和华对摩西说”、“得罪耶和华”和“从耶和华的册上涂抹”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华对摩西说”是指答复；“得罪耶和华”是指背离神性（参看<a href="10498.htm">10498</a>节）；“从耶和华的册上涂抹”是指不出现在天堂，因而属灵生命的毁灭。“从耶和华的册上涂抹”之所以具有这种含义，是因为那些兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物之人不能接受来自天堂的任何事物；事实上，从天堂接受东西的是内在，没有内在的外在只从地狱，而不会从其它任何源头接受东西。与人同在的天堂居于他的内在；内在就是生命册，在他的内在里面的事物由主那里从天堂而出（参看<a href="10505.htm">10505</a>节）。</p>

And Jehovah said unto Moses, He that hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book. That this signifies the reply, that those will perish who turn themselves away from the Divine, is evident 
from the signification of "Jehovah said unto Moses," as being the reply; from the signification of "sinning against Jehovah," as being to turn one's self away from the Divine (see above, n. 10498); and 
from the signification of "being blotted out of the book of Jehovah," as being not to appear in heaven, thus to perish in respect to the spiritual life. That this is signified by "being blotted out 
of the book of Jehovah," is because those who are in things external separate from what is internal cannot receive anything from heaven; for it is the internal which receives from heaven, and the external 
without the internal does not receive from any other source than hell. (That heaven with man is in his internal, and that the internal is the book of life, and that what is in the internal is out 
of heaven from the Lord, may be seen just above, n. 10505.) </p>

'And Jehovah said, The one who has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book' means the reply, that they will be destroyed who turn themselves away from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'Jehovah said to Moses' as the reply; from the meaning of 'sinning against Jehovah' as turning themselves away from the Divine, dealt with above in <a href="10498.htm">10498</a>; and from the meaning of 'being blotted 
out of Jehovah's book' as not appearing in heaven, thus the destruction of spiritual life. The reason why 'being blotted out of Jehovah's book' has this meaning is that those whose interest lies in 
external things separated from what is internal cannot receive anything from heaven, since the internal is what receives anything from there, and the only source from which the external without the internal 
receives something is hell.  </p>
<p>Heaven resides with a person in his internal; the internal is his 'book of life'; and the things within his internal are derived from heaven and exist from the Lord, 
see immediately above in <a href="10505.htm">10505</a>.

`Et dixit Jehovah, Illum qui peccavit Mihi, delebo eum e libro Meo': quod significet responsum quod illi perituri qui avertunt se a Divino, constat ex significatione `dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' quod 
sit responsum, ex significatione `peccare Jehovae' quod sit avertere se a Divino, de qua supra n. 10498, et ex significatione `deleri e libro Jehovae' quod sit non apparere in caelo, ita quoad vitam spiritualem 
perire; quod hoc per `deleri e libro Jehovae' significetur, est quia illi qui in externis separatis ab interno sunt non recipere aliquid e caelo possunt, internum enim est quod inde recipit, 
et externum absque illo non recipit aliunde aliquod quam ex inferno; quod caelum apud hominem sit in interno ejus, et quod internum sit `liber vitae,' et quae in interno sunt, e caelo a Domino sint, 
videatur mox supra n. 10,505. </p>
