<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4724节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4724.</strong>“趁他还没有走近他们，就同谋要害死他”表他们想要毁灭从主的神性人身发出的神性属灵层。这从“同谋”和“害死”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“同谋”是指由恶意所产生的欲望，因为凡人出于恶意所欲望的，都是他们密谋实现的目标；“害死”是指毁灭；“约瑟”是指神性属灵层或神性真理，如前面反复说明的。由于神性真理从主的神性人身发出，故我们说从主的神性人身发出的神性属灵层。<br />此处的情形是这样：在整个天堂，一切神性真理唯独从主的神性人身发出，并无其它源头。凡从神性本身发出来的，都无法直接流入任何天使，因为它是无限的；只能间接经由主的神性人身流入。这也是主说下面这些话的意思：<br />从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />这也解释了为何就其神性人身而言，主被称为中保。<br />这人身甚至自永恒就存在，因为神性存在若非经由天堂流入，并在如此行时变成神性显现，就无法传给任何天使，更无法传给任何灵人，最无法传给任何世人。就神性本身而言，主是神性存在；就神性人身而言，主是神性显现（参看<a href="4687.htm">4687</a>节）。然而，主的人身本身也无法从神性存在接受任何流注，除非这人身在祂里面变成神性；因为凡接受神性存在的，必也是神性。<br />由此可见，神性真理并非直接从神性本身发出，而是从主的神性人身发出。而且，那些鼓吹唯信，不过信仰生活的人在自己里面毁灭了这神性人身；因为他们以为，主的人身是纯人身，和其他任何人的人身没什么两样。因此，他们当中许多人否认主的神性，无论他们口头上如何信奉祂。但那些过着信仰生活的人则以谦卑的心屈膝跪拜主，将祂奉为他们的神和救主。当他们如此行时，祂的神性与人性不同且分离的教义就不会进入他们的脑海，如他们在领受圣餐时的情形。由此明显可知，对他们来说，主的神性人身就在他们内心，在他们心中占有一席之地。</p>

And before he came near into them, they conspired against him to cause him to die. That this signifies that they wished to extinguish the Divine spiritual which is from the Lord's Divine Human, is evident 
from the signification of "conspiring," as being to will from a depraved mind, since whatever men will from a depraved mind, they conspire to accomplish; and from the signification of "slaying," 
as being to extinguish; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the Divine spiritual or Divine truth, as repeatedly shown above. Because Divine truth proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human, it 
is therefore said,. the Divine spiritual which is from the Lord's Divine Human.  [2] The case herein is this: All the Divine truth in the whole heaven proceeds from no other source than the Lord's Divine 
Human. That which is from the Divine Itself cannot flow in immediately with any angel, because it is infinite; but only mediately through the Lord's Divine Human, as is also meant by these words 
of the Lord, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth" (John 1:18). For this reason also the Lord as to the Divine Human is called 
Mediator.  [3] This also was from eternity, for the Divine being, without flowing through heaven and becoming thence the Divine coming-forth, could not be communicated to any angel, still less 
to any spirit, and less still to any man. That the Lord as to the Divine Itself is the Divine being, and as to the Divine Human is the Divine coming-forth, may be seen above (n. 4687). Neither could the 
Lord's Human itself have received any influx from the Divine being, unless in Him the Human had been made Divine; for that which receives the Divine being must also be Divine. From these few things 
it may be seen that Divine truth does not proceed immediately from the Divine Itself, but from the Lord's Divine Human.  [4] This also do they extinguish in themselves who battle for faith alone and 
do not live a life of faith; for they believe that the Lord's Human is purely human, not unlike the human of another man; and hence many of them deny the Divine of the Lord, however they may profess 
Him with the lips. But those who live a life of faith, on bended knees and with humble hearts adore the Lord as God the Savior, and do not then at all think from doctrine of the distinction between the 
Divine and the human nature; and they do the same in the Holy Supper. Hence it is plain that with them the Lord's Divine Human is in their hearts. </p>

'And before he drew near to them they plotted against him, to put him to death' means that they desired to annihilate the Divine Spiritual which proceeded from the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'plotting' as desires resulting from ill-intent, for that which they desire because of ill-intent is the object of their plotting; from the meaning of 'putting to death' as annihilating; 
and from the representation of 'Joseph' as the Divine Spiritual or Divine Truth, dealt with above several times. Because Divine Truth proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human it is therefore referred 
to as the Divine Spiritual that proceeds from His Divine Human. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of this are as follows: All Divine Truth in the whole of heaven proceeds from no other source than the Lord's 
Divine Human. That which proceeds from the Divine itself, since this is Infinite, cannot possibly flow directly to any angel, only indirectly through the Lord's Divine Human. This is also what the following 
words spoken by the Lord mean, </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also explains why as to His Divine 
Human the Lord is called the Mediator. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This Human has existed even from eternity, for unless the Divine Being flowed through heaven, and in so doing became the Divine Manifestation, that Being 
could not have been communicated to any angel, still less to any spirit, and least of all to any man. For as regards the Divine itself the Lord is the Divine Being, and as regards the Divine Human 
He is the Divine Manifestation, see <a href="4687.htm">4687</a>. Yet the Lord's Human could not have received any influx from the Divine Being if the Human within Him had not been made Divine, for that which is to receive the 
Divine Being must itself be Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From these few observations it may be seen that Divine Truth does not proceed directly from the Divine itself but from the Lord's Divine Human. What is more, 
those who champion faith alone within themselves and do not lead the life of faith annihilate that Divine Human, for they believe that the Lord's Human is purely human, not unlike the human of any 
other person. Many of these people as a consequence also deny the Lord's Divinity, even though they confess Him with their lips. But those who lead the life of faith worship the Lord, on bended knees 
and with humble hearts, as their God and Saviour. As they do so the teaching that His Divine Nature is distinct and separate from His Human Nature does not enter their heads, as is likewise the case 
with them during the Holy Supper. From this it is evident that in their case the Lord's Divine Human has a place in their hearts. </p>

`Et antequam appropinquavit ad illos, et machinati sunt ei ad mori faciendum eum': quod significet quod exstinguere vellent Divinum Spirituale quod ex Divino Humano Domini, constat ex significatione 
`machinari' quod sit ex pravo animo velle, nam quot ex pravo animo {1} volunt, hoc machinantur; ex significatione `mori facere' quod sit exstinguere; et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quo sit Divinum 
Spirituale seu Divinum Verum, de qua supra aliquoties (t)quia Divinum Verum procedit ex Divino Humano Domini, ideo dicitur Divinum Spirituale quod ex Divino Humano Ipsius.  [2] Cum hoc ita se 
habet: omne Divinum Verum quod in universo caelo, non aliunde procedit quam a Divino Humano Domini; quod ab Ipso Divino, hoc nusquam apud aliquem angelum immediate influere potest, est enim Infinitum, 
sed mediate per Divinum Humanum Domini, quod etiam intelligitur per haec (t)verba Domini,           Deum nemo vidit unquam, Unigenitus Filius Qui in sinu      Patris [est], Ille exposuit, Joh. 
i 18; </p>
<p>inde etiam Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum vocatur Mediator.  [3] Hoc etiam ab aeterno fuit, Divinum enim Esse, absque influxu per caelum, et inde factum Divinum Existens, non potuit communicari 
cum aliquo angelo, minus cum aliquo spiritu, et adhuc minus cur aliquo homine; quod Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum sit Divinum Esse et quoad Divinum Humanum sit Divinum Existens, videatur n. 4687; 
Ipsum Humanum Domini nec potuisset recipere aliquem influxum a Divino Esse nisi in Ipso Humanum Divinum factum constare potest quod Divinum Verum non procedat immediate ab Ipso Divino, sed a Divino Humano 
Domini {2}.  Illud etiam exstinguunt ii apud se qui pro sola fide militant et non vivunt vitam fidei, ii enim credunt Humanum Domini esse pure humanum, non absimile {3} humano alius hominis, inde 
etiam plures ex illis Divinum Domini negant, utcumque Ipsum ore profitentur; at qui vivunt vitam fidei, Dominum genibus flexis et humili corde ut Deum Salvatorem adorant, nihil tunc cogitando 
ex doctrina de distinctione inter Naturam Divinam et Naturam Humanam; </p>
<p>similiter faciunt in Sancta Cena; inde patet quod apud eos Divinum Humanum Domini sit in cordibus {4}.      @1 eo$      @2 
i inde nunc dicitur quod vellent exstinguere Divinum Verum quod ex Divino Humano Domini$      @3 Humanum Domini credunt pure humanum, nec dissimile$      @4 i tametsi non in ore, quando ex doctrina 
loquuntur$ </p>
