<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5084节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5084.</strong>“护卫长府内的”表解释中的首要事物。这从“护卫长”的含义清楚可知，“护卫长”表示解释中的首要事物（<a href="4790.htm">4790</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。故此处的意思是，这两种感官印象被解释中的首要事物，也就是说，被在内义上属于圣言的事物抛弃。当解释中的首要事物不再依赖感官印象时，就说感官印象被抛弃了；因为感官印象，以及直接通过感官所获得的印象都是错觉。感官是在人里面起主导作用的一切错觉的源头，它们就是很少有人相信信之真理，并且属世人反对属灵人，也就是外在人反对内在人的原因。因此，如果属世人或外在人开始统治属灵人或内在人，信的事物就不再被相信；因为错觉会给它们蒙上阴影，恶欲则会窒息它们。<br />很少有人知道何为感官错觉，也很少有人相信它们给理性事物，尤其信的属灵事物蒙上如此大的阴影，以致这阴影会抹除它们。当此人同时以自我之爱和尘世之爱所产生的欲望为乐时，这种情况尤其会出现。这个主题可举例来说明，首先说明何为纯属世的感官错觉，也就是自然界的事物；然后说明何为在属灵事物上的感觉错觉。<br />⑴这是一个纯属世的感官错觉，或自然界的事物：相信太阳每天绕地球一圈，天空和所有星星也是。人们可能会被告知，如太阳这样的浩瀚火海，而且不仅太阳，还有不计其数的星星每天绕地球一圈，却不经历彼此间的任何位置变化，是不可能的，因而是无法想象的。另外，他们可能还被告知，从行星系统可以看出，地球通过绕轴自转和公转而日复一日、年复一年的旋转。这一点从以下事实得到确认：行星也是地球，其中有些带有围绕它们旋转的卫星；如观察所表明的，它们也像我们的地球那样日复一日、年复一年的旋转。然而，很多人仍有一种感官错觉，即：事情真如眼睛所看到的那样。<br />⑵这是一个纯属世感官错觉，或纯自然界的事物：大气是一个实体，只是逐渐变得越来越稀薄，直到大气不再有，真空出现。当唯独请教人的外在感官时，这外在感官不会告诉他别的。<br />⑶这是一个纯属世感官错觉：种子所拥有的长成花、木并自我繁殖的能力自创世之初就被赋予它们，这种最初赋予使得一切事物开始存在并持续存在。人们可能会被告知，没有什么东西能持续存在，除非它不断照以下法则不断存在，即：持续存在就是不断存在；以及凡与先于自身的某种事物没有联系的事物都会化为乌有，不复存在。尽管他们被告知这一切，但他们的身体感官和依赖于这些感官的思维却不理解。他们也不明白，每一个事物正如它通过来自灵界的流注，也就是说，经由灵界从神性而来的流注而存在那样持续存在。<br />⑷这产生了另一个纯属世的感官错觉，即：被称为单子或原子的单一实体是存在的。因为属世人以为凡被他的外在感官所理解的，都是一个单一实体，根本不是别的什么。<br />⑸这是一个纯属世错觉：一切事物皆属于并来自自然界，并且自然界的确有超出人类理解范畴的更纯粹、更内在的方面。但若有人说，属灵和属天之物存在于自然界之中或之上，这种观念就会被弃绝；因为人们信的是：一个事物若非是自然的，就不存在。<br />⑹这是一个感官错觉，唯有身体拥有生命，当身体死亡时，生命也就灭亡了。感官根本就不明白，内在人存在于外在人的一切细节中，内在人在自然界里面，就在灵界。结果，它们因对此没有概念，故不相信死后内在人仍活着，除非它再度披上肉体（<a href="5078.htm">5078</a>，<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>节）。<br />⑺这又产生了一个感官错觉：人和动物一样，死后不可能再活着，因为动物的生命和人的生命没什么两样，唯一区别在于：人是更完美的生物。感官，也就是依赖感官思考并由此得出结论的人不明白，人在动物之上，比动物优越，拥有更高层的生命，因为他不仅能思想事物的原因，还能思想神性，也能通过信和爱而与神性联结，以及接受由此而来的流注，并将所流入之物变成他自己的。因此，由于人对来自神性的这种流注的回应，人是有可能接受它的，而动物根本不能。<br />⑻这产生另一个错觉：实际活在人里面的，即所谓的灵魂，只是某种像空气或火焰样的东西；当人死去时，这种东西就会消散。此外还有一种错觉：灵魂要么在心脏，要么在脑部，要么在其它部位，它从那里掌控身体，好像这身体是一台机器。感官人不明白，内在人存在于外在人的每一部分中，眼睛不是凭自己看见，耳朵不是凭自己听见，而是凭内在人。<br />⑼这是一感官错觉：光和热没有其它源头，只可能源于太阳或物质的火。感官不明白，含有聪明在里面的光和含有天堂之爱在里面的热是存在的，所有天使都沐浴在这光和热中。<br />⑽这是一个感官错觉：人以为他凭自己活着，或生命被赋予他；在感官看来的确如此。感官根本就不明白，唯独神性凭自己拥有生命，因而唯有一个独一无二的生命，世上的生命只是接受它的形式（参看<a href="1954.htm">1954</a>，<a href="2706.htm">2706</a>，<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>，<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>，<a href="3001.htm">3001</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>，<a href="3337.htm">3337</a>，<a href="3338.htm">3338</a>，<a href="3484.htm">3484</a>，<a href="3742.htm">3742</a>，<a href="3743.htm">3743</a>，<a href="4151.htm">4151</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4320.htm">4320</a>，<a href="4417.htm">4417</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>，<a href="4524.htm">4524</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>节）。<br />⑾感官人误以为奸淫是可允许的，因为其感官使他认为婚姻的存在只是为了养育子女所需的秩序，只要不破坏这秩序，谁是孩子的父亲无关紧要。他还误以为婚姻状态与同某人发生性关系或淫乱没什么区别，只不过婚姻是被允许的。正因如此，他也相信，若非基督教界依据圣经来禁止，他娶数个妻子并不违反秩序。若被告知，天上的婚姻和地上的婚姻之间存在一种对应关系，没有人能拥有任何婚姻之物在里面，除非他处于属灵的真理与良善，并且真正的婚姻绝无可能存在于一个丈夫和数个妻子之间，因而婚姻本身是神圣的，感官人就会弃绝这一切，视为毫无价值。<br />⑿这是一个感官错觉：主的国或天堂类似地上的国，那里的喜乐和幸福在于比别人更伟大，因而比别人更有荣耀。因为感官人根本就不明白最小的就是最大的，为末的就是为首的是什么意思。这种人若被告知，在天堂或天使当中，喜乐在于为他人的福祉而服务，毫无功德或回报的想法，就会感到被迎头一击，仿佛这是悲哀的事。<br />⒀这是一个感官错觉：善行值得赏赐，甚至为了自我而向人行善也是一种善行。<br />⒁这也是一种感官错觉，人唯信得救，信能存在于没有仁的人里面，死后保留下来的是信仰，而非生活。其它很多例子也一样。因此，当感官在人里面主导从神性获得启示的理性时，他就什么也看不见了，并陷入黑暗。在这种情况下，建立在感官证据基础上的每一个结论都被视为理性。</p>

Of the house of the prince of the guards. That this signifies by those things which are primary for interpretation, is evident from the signification of the "prince of the guards," as being what is primary 
for interpretation (n. 4790, 4966). Here therefore the signification is that the sensuous things of both kinds were rejected by the things primary for interpretation, namely those which are of 
the Word as to the internal sense; and these sensuous things are said to be rejected when they have no faith in such things; for sensuous things and those which by their means enter immediately into the 
thought, are fallacious, and all the fallacies which prevail in man are from this source. It is from these that few believe the truths of faith, and that the natural man is opposed to the spiritual, 
that is, the external man to the internal; and therefore if the natural or external man begins to rule over the spiritual or internal man, the things of faith are no longer believed; for fallacies overshadow 
and cupidities suffocate them.  [2] As few know what the fallacies of the senses are, and few believe that they induce so great a shade on rational things, and most of all on the spiritual 
things of faith, even so as to extinguish them, especially when the man is at the same time in the delight of the cupidities from the love of self and the love of the world, the subject may be illustrated 
by examples, showing first what are the fallacies of the senses which are merely natural, or in those things which are in nature, and then what are the fallacies of the senses in spiritual things. 
(1) It is a fallacy of merely natural sense, or that which is in nature, to believe that the sun revolves once each day around this earth, and also the sky with all the stars; and although it is said 
that it is incredible-because impossible-that so great an ocean of fire as is the sun, and not only the sun but also innumerable stars, should revolve around the earth once every day without any change 
of place relatively to one another, and although it is added that it may be seen from the planets that the earth performs a daily and annual motion by rotation and revolution, the planets also being 
earths, some of them with moons revolving around them, and making - as is known by observation - daily and annual motions like our earth; nevertheless with very many persons the fallacy of sense prevails, 
that it is as it appears to the eye. [3] (2) It is a fallacy of merely natural sense, or that which is in nature, that there is only a single atmosphere, and that this is merely successively 
purer from one portion to another, and that where it ceases there is a vacuum. When only the external sensuous of man is consulted, it apprehends no otherwise. (3) It is a fallacy of merely natural sense, 
that from the first creation there has been impressed on seeds a property of growing up into trees and flowers, and of reproducing themselves, and that from this is the coming into existence and 
subsistence of all things. And if it is urged that it is not possible for anything to subsist unless it perpetually comes into existence, according to the law that subsistence is a perpetual coming into 
existence, and also that everything not connected with something prior to itself falls into nothing, still the sensuous of the body and the thought from this sensuous does not apprehend it, nor that 
each and all things subsist in the same way that they came into existence, by influx from the spiritual world, that is to say through the spiritual world from the Divine. [4] (4) Hence it is a fallacy 
of merely natural sense that there are simple substances, which are monads and atoms; for whatever is within the range of the external sensuous, the natural man believes to be a simple substance, 
or else nothing. (5) It is a fallacy of merely natural sense that all things are of nature and from nature, and that there indeed is something in purer or interior nature which is not apprehended; but 
if it is said that within or above nature there is what is spiritual and celestial, this is rejected; and it is believed that if it is not natural, it is nothing. (6) It is a fallacy of sense that only 
the body lives, and that its life perishes when it dies. The sensuous does not at all apprehend that the internal man is in every particular of the external man, and that the internal man is within 
nature, and in the spiritual world; hence it does not believe, because it does not apprehend, that the internal man will live after death unless it is again clothed with the body (n. 5078, 5079). [5] 
(7) Hence it is a fallacy of sense that man cannot live after death any more than the beasts, because these also have a life similar in many respects to that of man, man being only a more perfect animal. 
The sensuous, that is, the man who thinks and draws conclusions therefrom, does not apprehend that man is above the beasts and has a higher life, because he can think not only about the causes of 
things, but also about the Divine, and can by faith and love be conjoined with the Divine, and also receive influx therefrom and make it his own, thus that as there is reciprocity in man there is also 
reception, as is by no means the case with beasts. [6] (8) It is a fallacy thence derived that the very living part of man, which is called the soul, is merely something ethereal, or flamy, which 
is dissipated when the man dies; and that it resides in the heart, or in the brain, or in some part of this, and from thence rules the body as if this were a machine. That the internal man is in every 
part of the external man, and that the eye does not see from itself, nor the ear hear from itself, but from the internal man, the sensuous man does not apprehend. (9) It is a fallacy of sense that light, 
and also heat, can come from no other source than the sun or elementary fire. That there is light in which is intelligence, and heat in which is heavenly love, and that all the angels are in this 
light and heat, the sensuous does not apprehend. (10) It is a fallacy of sense that man believes that he lives of himself, or that life has been imparted to him; for so it appears to the sensuous mind. 
That it is the Divine alone which has life of itself, and thus that there is only one life, and that the lives in the world are only recipient forms, the sensuous mind does not at all apprehend (see 
n. 1954, 2706, 2886-2889, 2893, 3001, 3318, 3337, 3338, 3484, 3742, 3743, 4151, 4249, 4318-4320, 4417, 4523, 4524, 4882). [7] (11) The sensuous man believes from fallacy that adulteries are allowable; 
for from the sensuous he concludes that marriages are instituted merely in behalf of order for the sake of the education of the offspring; and that so long as this order is not destroyed, it is immaterial 
from whom the offspring comes; and also that what is of marriage differs from lasciviousness merely in its being allowed; thus also that it would not be contrary to order to marry more than one 
wife, if it were not forbidden by the Christian world from Holy Scripture. If they are told that there is a correspondence between the heavenly marriage and marriages on earth, and that no one can 
have in himself anything of marriage unless he is in spiritual truth and good, also that genuine marriage cannot possibly exist between a husband and several wives, and hence that marriages are in themselves 
holy, these things are rejected by the sensuous man as of no account. (12) It is a fallacy of sense that the Lord's kingdom, or heaven, resembles an earthly kingdom in respect that the joy and 
happiness there consist in one being greater than another, and hence having more glory than another; for the sensuous does not at all comprehend what is meant by the least being greatest, or the last 
first. If they are told that joy in heaven or to the angels consists in serving others by benefiting them, without any thought of merit or recompense, this strikes them as something sad. (13) It is a 
fallacy of sense that good works merit reward, and that to benefit anyone for the sake of self is a good work. (14) It is also a fallacy of sense that man is saved by faith alone, and that faith can 
exist in one who has no charity, and also that it is the faith, and not the life, that remains after death. In like manner in very many other instances. When therefore what is sensuous rules in man, the 
rational enlightened from the Divine sees nothing and is in thick darkness, and it is then believed that everything is rational which is concluded from what is sensuous. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5084</b></p><p><b>5084.</b>
'Of the house of the chief of the attendants' means the things that are first and foremost in explanations. This is clear from the meaning of 'the chief of the attendants' as the things which are first 
and foremost in explanations, dealt with in <a href="4790.htm">4790</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. The meaning here therefore is that both kinds of sensory impressions were cast aside by the things which are first and foremost in explanations, 
that is to say, by those which belong to the Word in the internal sense. Sensory impressions are said to be cast aside when the things that are first and foremost in explanations place no reliance 
on them; for they are indeed sensory impressions, and impressions received by the mind directly through the senses are illusions. The senses are the source of all the illusions that reign in a person, 
and they are the reason why few have any belief in the truths of faith and why the natural man is opposed to the spiritual man, that is, the external man to the internal. Consequently if the natural 
or external man starts to have dominion over the spiritual or internal man, no belief at all in matters of faith exists any longer, for illusions cast a shadow over them and evil desires smother them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Few know what the illusions of the senses are and few believe that these cast a shadow over rational insights and most of all over spiritual matters of faith - a shadow so dark that it blots 
them out. This happens especially when at the same time what a person delights in is the result of desires bred by a selfish and worldly love. But let examples be used to shed some light on this matter, 
first some examples of illusions of the senses which are purely natural ones, that is, illusions about things within the natural creation, then some examples of such illusions in spiritual things. </p>
<p>i 
It is an illusion of the senses - a purely natural one, or an illusion about the natural creation - to believe that the sun is borne round this globe once a day, and that the sky too and all the 
stars are borne round at the same time. People may be told that it is impossible and therefore inconceivable that so vast an ocean of fire as the sun, and not only the sun but also the countless stars, 
should revolve once a day without undergoing any changes of position in relation to one another. They may be told in addition that one can see from the planetary system that our own globe performs a 
daily movement and an annual one, by rotations on its axis and by revolutions. This can be recognized from the fact that the planets are globes like ours, some of which have moons around them and all 
of which, as observation shows, perform daily and annual movements like ours. But for all that they are told, the illusion the senses prevails with very many people - that things really are as the eye 
sees them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 ii It is an illusion of the senses - a purely natural one, or an illusion about the natural creation - that the atmosphere is a single entity, except that it becomes gradually and 
increasingly rarified until a vacuum exists where the atmosphere comes to an end. A person's external senses tell him nothing else than this when their evidence alone is relied on. </p>
<p>iii It is an illusion 
of the senses, a purely natural one, that the power which seeds have to grow into trees and flowers and to reproduce themselves was conferred on them when creation first began, and that that initial 
conferment is what causes everything to come into being and remain in being. People may be told that nothing can remain in being unless it is constantly being brought into being, in keeping with 
the law that continuance in being involves a constant coming into being, and with another law that anything that has no connection with something prior to itself ceases to have any existence. But though 
they are told all this, their bodily senses and their thought that is reliant on their senses, cannot take it in. Nor can they see that every single thing is kept in being, even as it was brought into 
being, through an influx from the spiritual world, that is, from the Divine coming through the spiritual world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 iv This gives rise to another illusion of the senses, a purely natural one, that 
single entities exist called monads and atoms. For the natural man believes that anything comprehended by his external senses is a single entity or else nothing at all. </p>
<p>v It is an illusion of the 
senses, a purely natural one, that everything is part of and begins in the natural creation, though there are indeed purer and more inward aspects of the natural creation that are beyond the range 
of human understanding. But if anyone says that a spiritual or celestial dimension exists within or above the natural creation, this idea is rejected; for the belief is that unless a thing is natural 
it has no existence. </p>
<p>vi It is an illusion of the senses that only the body possesses life and that when it dies that life perishes. The senses have no conception at all of an internal man present within 
each part of the external man, nor any conception that this internal man resides in the inward dimension of the natural creation, in the spiritual world. Nor consequently, since they have no conception 
of it, do the senses believe that a person will live after death, apart from being clothed with the body once again, <a href="5078.htm">5078</a>, <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 vii This gives rise to the further illusion of the senses 
that no human being can have a life after death any more than animals do, for the reason that the life of an animal is much the same as that of a human being, the only difference being that man is a 
more perfect kind of living creature. The senses - that is, the person who relies on his senses to think with and form conclusions - have no conception of the human being as one who is superior to animals 
or who possesses a life superior to theirs because of his ability to think not only about the causes of things but also about what is Divine. The human being also has the ability to be joined through 
faith and love to the Divine, as well as to receive an influx from Him and to make what flows in his own. Thus because of his response to such influx from the Divine it is possible for the human 
being to receive it, which is not at all the case with animals.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 viii This gives rise to yet another illusion, which is that what is actually living in the human being - what is called the soul 
- is merely something air-like or flame-like which is dispersed when the person dies. Added to this is the illusion that the soul is situated either in the heart, or in the brain, or in some other part 
of him, from where it controls the body as if this were a machine. One who relies on his senses has no conception of an internal man present in every part of his external man, no conception that the 
eye sees not of its own accord, and that the ear hears not of its own accord, but under the direction of the internal man. </p>
<p>ix It is an illusion of the senses that no other source of light is possible 
than the sun or else material fire, and that no other source of heat than these is possible. The senses have no conception of the existence of a light that holds intelligence within it, or of a 
heat that holds heavenly love within it, or that all angels are bathed in that light and heat. </p>
<p>x It is an illusion of the senses when a person believes that he lives independently, that is, that an 
underived life is present within him; for this is what the situation seems to be to the senses. The senses have no conception at all that the Divine alone is one whose life is underived, thus that there 
is but one actual life, and that anything in the world that has life is merely a form receiving it, see <a href="1954.htm">1954</a>, <a href="2706.htm">2706</a>, <a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>, <a href="2893.htm">2893</a>, <a href="3001.htm">3001</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>, <a href="3337.htm">3337</a>, <a href="3338.htm">3338</a>, <a href="3484.htm">3484</a>, <a href="3742.htm">3742</a>, <a href="3743.htm">3743</a>, <a href="4151.htm">4151</a>, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>, <a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4310.htm">4310</a>, <a href="4417.htm">4417</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>, <a href="4524.htm">4524</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 xi The person who relies on his senses can be misled into a belief that adulterous relationships are allowable; for his senses lead him to think that marriages exist merely 
for the sake of order which the upbringing of children necessitates, and that provided this order is not destroyed it makes no difference who fathers the children. He can also be misled into thinking 
that the married state is no different from having sex with someone, except that it is allowable. That being so, he also believes that it would not be contrary to order for him to many several wives 
if the Christian world, basing its ideas on the Sacred Scriptures, did not forbid it. If told that a correspondence exists between the heavenly marriage and marriages on earth, and that no one can 
have anything of marriage within him unless spiritual good and truth are present there, also that a genuinely conjugial relationship cannot possibly exist between one man and several wives, and consequently 
that marriages are intrinsically holy, the person who relies on his senses rejects all this as worthless.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 xii It is an illusion of the senses that the Lord's kingdom, or heaven, is like 
an earthly kingdom, that joy and happiness there consist in one person holding a higher position than another and as a consequence possessing more glory than another. For the senses have no conception 
at all of what is implied by the idea that the least is the greatest and the last is the first. If such people are told that joy in heaven or among angels consists in serving the welfare of others 
without any thought of merit or reward, it strikes them as a sorrowful existence. </p>
<p>xiii It is an illusion of the senses that good works earn merit and that to do good to someone even for a selfish 
reason is a good work.  </p>
<p>xiv It is also an illusion of the senses that a person is saved by faith alone, and that faith may exist with someone who has no charity, as well as that faith, not life, is 
what remains after death. One could go on with very many other illusions of the senses; for when a person is governed by his senses the rational degree within him, which is enlightened by the Divine, 
does not see anything. It dwells in thickest darkness, in which case every conclusion based on sensory evidence is thought to be a rational one. </p>

annuos faciant;(n) {4} usque tamen apud perplures fallacia sensus obtinet quod ita sit prout oculus videt. lI. Fallacia sensus mere naturalis seu in natura 3 est quod solum unica atmosphaera sit et 
modo ea purior in partibus successive, et quod ubi illa desinit, sit vacuum; sensuale externum hominis {5}non aliter capit cum solum hoc consulitur.  III. Fallacia sensus mere naturalis est quod 
a prima creatione impressa sit seminibus qualitas excrescendi in arbores et flores, et se prolificandi, et quod inde omnium existentia et {6} subsistentia; </p>
<p>et si illis dicitur quod subsistere aliquid 
nequeat nisi perpetuo existat, secundum canonem quod subsistentia sit perpetua existentia, {7}tum quod omne inconnexum a priore se cadat in nihilum, usque tamen sensuale corporis et cogitatio ex 
illo sensuali, non capit illud, {8}nec quod omnia et singula subsistant, sicut exstiterant, per influxum a mundo spirituali, hoc est, per mundum spiritualem a Divino.  IV. Fallacia sensus mere naturalis (t)est 
inde 4 quod sint substantiae simplices quae monades {9}et atomi; quicquid enim intra sensuale externum est, hoc credit naturalis homo, quod {10} tale sit, vel nihil. {11} V. Fallacia sensus 
mere naturalis est quod omnia naturae sint et ex natura, et quod quidem in puriore seu interiore natura aliquid sit quod non capitur, sed {12}si dicitur quod intra {13}seu supra naturam sit spirituale 
{14}ac caeleste, hoc rejicitur, et creditur nisi id naturale sit, quod nihil sit. VI. Fallacia sensus est quod solum corpus vivat, et quod vita ejus pereat cum moritur; sensuale prorsus 
non capit quod internus homo sit in singulis externi, et quod is sit intra naturam in mundo spirituali; inde nec credit, quia non capit, quod post mortem victurus, nisi corpore rursus circuminduatur, 
5 n. 5078, 5079. VII. Fallacia sensus (t)est inde quod homo non magis vivere possit post mortem quam bestiae, ex causa quia hae quoque vitam habent in multis similem vitae hominis, modo quod homo 
animal perfectius sit; sensuale non capit, hoc est, homo qui ex sensuali cogitat et concludit, quod homo {15}in eo supra bestias sit, et ei vita superior, quia cogitare potest, non modo de causis 
rerum sed etiam de Divino, ac Divino per fidem et amorem conjungi, ut et recipere influxum inde et sibi appropriare, ita quod in homine quia datur 6 reciprocum, detur receptio, quod nequaquam apud 
bestias.  VIII. Fallacia (t)est inde quod ipsum vivum apud hominem quod anima vocatur, sit modo aliquod aethereum vel flammeum, quod dissipatur cum homo moritur; et quod id resideat vel in corde, 
vel in cerebro, vel in aliqua parte ejus, et quod inde regat corpus sicut machinam; quod internus homo sit in singulis externi, quod oculus non videat ex se sed ex illo, nec auris audiat ex se sed 
ex illo, homo sensualis non capit.  IX. Fallacia sensus est quod non aliunde lux dari queat quam ex sole aut igne elementari, nec aliunde calor quam inde; quod sit lux in qua intelligentia, et calor 
in quo amor caelestis, et quod in illa luce et in illo calore sint omnes angeli, sensuale non capit. X. Fallacia sensus est quod homo credat se vivere ex se, seu quod ei indita sit vita, non enim 
aliter apparet coram sensuali; quod solum Divinum sit Cui vita {16} ex se, et sic quod unica vita sit, et quod vitae in mundo sint modo formae recipientes, sensuale prorsus non capit, videatur n. 
1954, 2706, 2886-2889, 2893, 3001, 3318, 3337, 3338, 3484, 3742, 3743, 4151, 4249, 4318-4320, 4417, 4523, 4524, 4882. 7  {17}XI. Homo sensualis ex fallacia credit quod adulteria sint licita, ex sensuali 
enim concludit quod conjugia sint modo ordinis causa propter educationem subolis, et si non ordo ille destruitur quod perinde sit a quonam suboles; tum quod conjugiale sit sicut aliud lascivum 
sed concessum; ita quoque quod contra ordinem non foret plures uxores ducere, si non Christianus orbis ex Scriptura Sacra id prohiberet; si illis dicitur quod correspondentia sit inter conjugium 
caeleste et conjugia in terris, et quod conjugiale nemo in se habere possit nisi sit in vero et bono spirituali, tum quod genuinum conjugiale nequaquam dari queat inter {18}maritum et plures uxores, 
et inde quod conjugia in se sancta sint, haec sensualis homo rejicit sicut nihil. XII. Fallacia sensus est quod regnum Domini seu caelum sit quale 8 regnum terrestre, in eo quod ibi gaudium et felicitas 
sit ut unus major sit altero et inde in gloria prae altero; sensuale enim prorsus non capit quid sit quod minimus sit maximus, seu ultimus primus; si eis dicatur quod gaudium in caelo seu 
angelis sit aliis servire benefaciendo, absque ulla reflexione meriti et retributionis, hoc sicut triste obvenit. XIII. Fallacia sensus est quod bona opera mereantur: et quod facere alicui bene sui 
causa, sit bonum opus. XIV. Etiam fallacia sensus est quod salvetur homo per solam fidem; </p>
<p>et quod fides dari queat apud quem non est charitas; tum quod fides maneat non vita post mortem. Similiter 
in perpluribus aliis; </p>
<p>quapropter cum sensuale apud hominem dominatur, tunc rationale illustratum a Divino nihil videt, est in densa caligine, et tunc creditur quod omne id rationale sit quod ex sensuali 
concluditur. @1 i sicut quae interpretationis Verbi quoad sensum internum$ @2 quod$ @3 quidem etiam I$ @4 i haec tametsi dicuntur$ @5 After consulitur$ @6 i quoque$ @7 et$ @8 i ita$ @9
