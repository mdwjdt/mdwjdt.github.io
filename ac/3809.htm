<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3809节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3809.</strong>“领他到自己的家”表结合。这从“领到家”的含义清楚可知，“领到家”是指带给他自己，因为就内义而言，一个人自己就被称为一个“家”（<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>，<a href="3142.htm">3142</a>，<a href="3538.htm">3538</a>节）。他凭良善被称为家，严格来说，良善才是“家”（<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2331.htm">2331</a>，<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。故在这种情况下，意思就是带给拉班所代表的良善。正因如此，“领到自己的家”在此表示结合。就内义而言，本节充分描述了“雅各”所表示的属世良善与“拉班”所表示的旁系良善联结的整个过程。下面五个阶段则构成这个过程，即：相互承认，同意，情感，联结的初始阶段，实际的结合。相互承认由“拉结就跑去告诉她父亲”和“拉班听见外甥雅各的消息”来表示（<a href="3804.htm">3804</a>，<a href="3805.htm">3805</a>节）；同意由“拉班跑去迎接”来表示（<a href="3806.htm">3806</a>节）；情感由“拉班拥抱他”来表示（<a href="3807.htm">3807</a>节）；初始阶段由“亲吻他”来表示（<a href="3808.htm">3808</a>节）；结合由“领他到自己的家”来表示，如此处所述。</p>

And brought him to his house. That this signifies to conjunction, is evident from the signification of "bringing to a house," as being to himself; for in the internal sense man himself is called a "house" 
(n. 3128, 3142, 3538); and this from good, which properly is a "house" (n. 2233, 2234, 3652, 3720). In the present case therefore the signification is to the good which is represented by Laban; 
so that by "bringing to his house" is here signified conjunction. There is here fully described in the internal sense the process of the conjunction of natural good which is "Jacob," with collateral good 
which is "Laban." The following five things constitute this process; namely, mutual acknowledgment, agreement, affection, initiation, and conjunction. Mutual acknowledgment was signified by Rachel 
running and telling her father, and by Laban hearing the report of Jacob his sister's son (n. 3804, 3805); agreement was signified by Laban running to meet him (n. 3806); affection by Laban embracing 
him (n. 3807); initiation by his kissing him (n. 3808); and conjunction by his bringing him to his house, as here stated. </p>

'And brought him to his house' means to their being joined together. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing to the house' as taking to oneself, for in the internal sense a person himself is called 
'a house', see <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, <a href="3242.htm">3242</a>, <a href="3538.htm">3538</a>. He is so called by virtue of good, which strictly speaking is 'the house', <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2331.htm">2331</a>, <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>. In this case therefore a bringing to the good represented by 'Laban' 
is meant. That being so, 'bringing to his house' here means a joining together. This verse in the internal sense describes the whole process by which natural good meant by 'Jacob' is joined to a parallel 
good meant by 'Laban'. The following five phases constitute that process: Mutual acknowledgement, agreement, affection, an initial stage to a joining together, and actual joining together. Mutual 
acknowledgement was meant by 'Rachel ran and told her father' and by 'Laban heard the news about Jacob his sister's son', dealt with in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=3804%203805:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">3804 3805:</a> agreement by 'Laban ran to meet him', dealt with 
in 3806: affection by 'Laban embraced him', dealt with in 3807: the initial stage to a joining together by 'he kissed him', dealt with in 3808: and the joining together by 'he brought him to his house', 
dealt with in this paragraph. </p>

`Et adduxit eum ad domum suam': quod significet ad conjunctionem, constat a significatione `adducere ad domum' quod sit ad se, ipse enim homo in sensu interno vocatur `domus,' videatur n. 3128, 3142, 
3538, et hoc ex bono, quod proprie est `domus,' n. 2233, 2331, 3652, 3720, hic itaque ad bonum quod per Labanem repraesentatur; quapropter per adducere ad domum suam hic significatur conjunctio. 
 Hic in sensu interno plene describitur processus conjunctionis boni naturalis quod `Jacob,' cum bono collaterali quod `Laban'; sunt haec quinque quae processum illum constituunt, nempe mutus agnitio, 
convenientia, affectio, initiatio et conjunctio; mutua agnitio significata est per quod `Rachel cucurrit et indicavit patri suo,' et per quod `Laban audivit famam Jacobi filii sororis suae,' 
de qua n. 3804, 3805; convenientia per quod `Laban cucurrit obviam ei,' de qua n. 3806; affectio per quod `Laban amplexus eum,' de qua n. 3807; initiatio per quod `osculatus eum,' de qua n. 3808; 
et conjunctio, per quod `adduxerit eum ad domum suam,' de qua hic. </p>
