<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2383节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2383.</strong>“他们又击打，使他们都瞎了眼”表他们充满虚假。这从“瞎了眼”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“瞎眼”论及那些沉浸于虚假之人，以及那些对真理一无所知之人。这二者都被称为“瞎眼”；不过，从整个思路，尤其从内义就能看出具体表示哪一种。凡沉浸于虚假的人都被称为“瞎眼”，这从以下经文明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />他看守的人是瞎眼的，都没有知识，都是哑巴狗，不能叫唤。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.10.htm">56:10</a>）<br />“瞎眼的看守人”表那些由于推理而沉浸于虚假的人。同一先知书：<br />我们指望光亮，看哪，却只有黑暗，指望光明，却行在幽暗中。我们摸索墙壁，好像瞎子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.9.htm">59:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.10.htm">10</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />他们在街上如瞎子乱走，又被血玷污，以致他们用衣服触摸了他们不能玷污的。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.14.htm">4:14</a>）<br />这表示一切真理都被玷污，“街上”表他们在其中误入歧途的真理（<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />到那日，我必使一切马匹惊惶，使骑马的颠狂。使列民的一切马匹瞎眼。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.4.htm">12:4</a>）<br />在圣言中，此处及别处的“马匹”皆表理解力。因此，经上说“使一切马匹惊惶，使列民的一切马匹瞎眼”，也就是充满虚假。<br />约翰福音：<br />我为审判到这世上来，叫不能看见的，可以看见；能看见的，反瞎了眼。一些法利赛人听见这话，就说，难道我们也瞎了眼吗？耶稣对他们说，你们若瞎了眼，就没有罪了；但如今你们说，我们能看见，所以你们的罪还在。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.39.htm">9:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.41.htm">41</a>）<br />此处所说的“瞎眼”具有双重含义，也就是说，既指那些沉浸于虚假的人，也指那些对真理一无所知的人。对那些知道何为真理的教会中人来说，“瞎眼”是指虚假；但对那些不知道何为真理的人来说，如教会之外的人，“瞎眼”是指对真理的无知。后者是无可指责的。<br />同一福音书：<br />主叫他们瞎了眼、硬了心，免得他们眼睛看见，心里明白，我就医治他们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">12:40</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处的意思是，对他们来说，处于虚假比处于真理更好，因为他们过着邪恶的生活。他们若在真理方面得到指教，不仅会歪曲它们，还会以邪恶玷污它们。出于同样的原因，所多玛人受到击打，瞎了眼，也就是说，教义充满虚假。至为何这样做，前面已经说明（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>节）。<br />由于“瞎眼”表虚假之物，故在犹太人的代表性教会中，人们不可将瞎眼的献上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.22.htm">22:22</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.21.htm">15:21</a>；玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛1.8.htm">1:8</a>）。凡瞎眼的祭司也不可近前来在坛上献祭（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.18.htm">21:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.21.htm">21</a>）。<br />“瞎眼”用来论及那些对真理一无所知的人，如外邦人，这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />到那日，聋子必听见这书卷上的话；瞎子的眼，必在漆黑幽暗中也能看见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.18.htm">29:18</a>）<br />此处“瞎眼”表那些对真理一无知的人，主要是那些教会之外的人。同一先知书：<br />你要将有眼而瞎、有耳而聋的民都带出来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.8.htm">43:8</a>）<br />这论及外邦人的教会。<br />我要引瞎子行不认识的道，在他们面前使黑暗变为光明。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.16.htm">42:16</a>）<br /><br />我必使你作人民的光，开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出地牢，领坐黑暗的出监牢。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论及主的到来，因为到那时，对真理无知的人会得到指教。那些沉浸于虚假的人不让自己接受指教，因为他们知道真理，却确认反对它，将真理之光转化为无法被驱散的黑暗。路加福音：<br />家主就对仆人说，快出去，到城里大街小巷，领那贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的来。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.21.htm">14:21</a>）<br />这论及主的国度，不是指字义上那些贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的，而是指灵义上这样的人。<br /><br />耶稣说，他们把瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻疯的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们的事告诉约翰。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.22.htm">7:22</a>）<br />根据字义，这些人只是指身体上瞎眼的、瘸腿的、长大麻疯的、聋子、死人和穷人。因为这些事的确发生了，也就是说，瞎眼的看到光，聋子听见，长大麻疯的痊愈，死人复活。<br />然而，就内义而言，这些人在以赛亚书中也有所提及：<br />那时，瞎子的眼必睁开，聋子的耳必开通；瘸子必跳跃像鹿，哑巴的舌头必能歌唱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.5.htm">35:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这论及主的到来和那时的新教会，该新教会被称为外邦人的教会。外邦人被描述为“瞎子”、“聋子”、“瘸子”和“哑巴”，他们由于其教义和生活而被如此称呼。因为要知道，主所施行的一切神迹总是涉及这类事，并因此表示诸如瞎子、瘸子、麻疯病人、死人和穷人在内义上所表示的那类事。所以，主的这些神迹，和在埃及、旷野所施行的神迹，以及圣言中所描述的其它神迹一样，都是神性。这是一个奥秘。</p>

They smote with blindness. That this signifies that they were filled with falsities, is evident from the signification of "blindness." In the Word "blindness" is predicated of those who are in falsity, 
and also of those who are in ignorance of truth. Both are called the "blind;" but which are meant in any special instance can be seen from the series or connection, especially in the internal sense. 
That they who are in falsity are called the "blind," is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark 
(Isa. 56:10). "Blind watchmen," denotes those who from reasoning are in falsity. Again: </p>
<p>     We look for light, and behold darkness; for brightness, but we walk in thick darkness; we grope for the wall 
like the blind (Isa. 59:9-10). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They have wandered as the blind in the streets; they have polluted themselves with blood; what they cannot pollute, they touch with their garments 
(Lam. 4:14); </p>
<p>meaning that all truths have been polluted; the "streets" denoting the truths wherein they have gone astray (n. 2336). [2] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     In that day I will smite every horse with 
astonishment, and his rider with madness; every horse of the peoples will I smite with blindness (Zech. 12:4). Here and elsewhere in the Word a "horse" denotes the understanding; hence it is said that 
the "horse should be smitten with astonishment," and that the "horse of the peoples should be smitten with blindness," that is, should be filled with falsities. [3] In John: </p>
<p>     For judgment am 
I come into the world, that they that see not may see, and that they that see may become blind. They of the Pharisees heard these things, and said, Are we also blind? Jesus said unto them, If ye were 
blind, ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, therefore your sin remaineth (John 9:39-41). Here the "blind" in both senses are spoken of, namely, those who are in falsity, and those who are 
in ignorance of truth. With those who are within the church and know what the truth is, "blindness" is falsity; but with those who do not know what the truth is (as is the case with those who are outside 
the church), "blindness" is ignorance of the truth, and these are blameless. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand 
with their heart, and I should heal them (John 12:40; Isa. 6:9-11); </p>
<p>meaning that it would be better for them to be in falsities than to be in truths, because they are in a life of evil, and if 
they were instructed in truths, they would not only still falsify them, but would also defile them with evils; for the like reason that the men of Sodom were smitten with blindness, that is, the doctrinal 
things were filled with falsities. (Why this was done was shown above, n. 301-303, 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2426.)  [5] As what is blind signified what is false, therefore in the representative 
Jewish Church it was forbidden to sacrifice anything that was blind (Lev. 22:22; Deut. 15:21; Mal. 1:8). It was also forbidden that any one of the priests who was blind should draw near to 
offer upon the altar (Lev. 21:18, 21). [6] That "blindness" is predicated of ignorance of truth, such as prevails with the Gentiles, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day shall the deaf hear the words 
of the Book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick darkness and out of darkness (Isa. 29:18). Here the "blind" denotes those who are in ignorance of truth, being chiefly those outside 
the church. Again: </p>
<p>     Bring forth the blind people and they shall have eyes;* and the deaf and they shall have ears (Isa. 43:8); </p>
<p>where the church of the Gentiles is spoken of. Again: </p>
<p>     I will 
lead the blind in a way that they have not known; I will make darkness light before them (Isa. 42:16). [7] And again: </p>
<p>     I will give Thee for a light of the people, to open the blind eyes, to bring 
out the bound from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house (Isa. 42:6-7); </p>
<p>where the Lord's advent is treated of, in that they who are in ignorance of truth should then be 
instructed; for those who are in falsity do not suffer themselves to be so instructed, because they are acquainted with the truth and have confirmed themselves against it, and have turned the light into 
darkness, which cannot be dispelled. In Luke: </p>
<p>     The master of the house said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, 
and the lame, and the blind (Luke 14:21); </p>
<p>where the Lord's kingdom is treated of, and it is evident that the poor, maimed, lame, and blind are not meant, but those who are such in the spiritual sense. [8] 
Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said that they should tell John that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and to the poor the gospel is preached (Luke 
7:22). According to the sense of the letter, by the "blind," the "lame," the  "lepers," the "deaf," the "dead," the "poor," only these are meant; because it was actually the case that the blind received 
sight, the deaf hearing, the lepers health, the dead life. [9] But yet in the internal sense the same are meant as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the 
deaf shall be unstopped, and the lame shall leap as the hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing (Isa. 35:5-6); </p>
<p>where the Lord's advent is treated of, and the new church at that time, which is called 
that of the Gentiles; of whom it is declared that they were "blind," "deaf," "lame," and "dumb;" being so called in respect to doctrine and to life. For be it known that all the miracles performed 
by the Lord always involved, and thence signified, such things as are meant in the internal sense by the healing of the blind, of the lame, of the lepers, the deaf, the dead, and the poor. For this 
reason the Lord's miracles were Divine, as also were those performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, as well as all the other miracles that are treated of in the Word. This is an arcanum. * Et oculi 
erunt; but cui oculi sunt in n. 6989. [Rotch ed.] </p>

That 'they struck with blindness' means that they were filled with falsities is clear from the meaning of 'blindness'. In the Word blindness is used in reference to people who are immersed in falsity, 
and also to people who have no knowledge of the truth. Both kinds of people are called blind, though who are meant in any one place becomes clear from the train of thought, especially that in the internal 
sense. That those immersed in falsity are called 'blind' is clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot 
bark. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2056:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 56: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Blind watchmen' stands for those who, because of reasoning, are immersed in falsity. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
We look for light, and, behold, darkness; for brightness, but 
we walk in thick darkness. We grope for the wall like the blind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59: 9, 10</a>, </p>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>They went astray blind in the streets; they defiled themselves with blood. Things which have no power 
they touch with their garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for the fact that all truths have been defiled, 'streets' standing for truths in which they have gone astray, <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
On 
that day I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. Every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12: 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here and elsewhere in the Word 'a horse' stands 
for what has to do with the understanding. This is why it is said that the horse would be struck with panic, and [every] horse of the peoples with blindness, that is, it would be filled with falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In John, </p>
<p>For judgement I came into the world, that those who do not see may see, but that those who see may become blind. Some of the Pharisees heard these words and said, Are we also blind? 
Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see', therefore your sin remains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:-39-41&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:-39-41</a>. </p>
<p>Here the blind in both senses are referred to, that is to say, 
those who are immersed in falsity and those who have no knowledge of truth. With those inside the Church who know what the truth is, 'blindness' is falsity; but with those who do not know what the truth 
is, as with those outside the Church, 'blindness' is having no knowledge of the truth. The latter are blameless. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest 
they see with their eyes and understand with their heart and I heal them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12: 40</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:%209-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6: 9-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning here is that it would be better for falsities to exist with them than truths, for 
they lead a life of evil and if they received instruction in truths they would not only continue to falsify them but would also pollute them with evils. They would do so for the same reason that the 
men of Sodom were struck with blindness, that is, matters of doctrine were filled with falsities. Why this is done has been shown in <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Because 'blind' 
meant that which was false, therefore people were not allowed in the Jewish representative Church to sacrifice anything blind, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2022:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 22: 22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2015:%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 15: 21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%201:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 1: 8</a>. Also any priest who was blind 
was forbidden to approach and offer on the altar, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2021:%2018,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 21: 18, 21</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'blindness' is used in reference to those, like gentiles, who have no knowledge of the truth, is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On 
that day the deaf will hear the words of the Book, and out of thick darkness and out of darkness the eyes of the blind will see. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2029:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 29: 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The blind' stands for people who have no knowledge of 
the truth, chiefly those who are outside the Church. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Bring forth the blind people and they will have eyes; and the deaf, and they will have ears. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 
the Church of the gentiles. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lead the blind in a way they do not know; I will turn the darkness before them into light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42: 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will 
give You to be a light of the people, to open the blind eyes, to bring the bound out of the dungeon, from the prison-house those who sit in darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42: 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming 
and the fact that at that time people who had no knowledge of truth were to receive instruction. For those immersed in falsity do not allow themselves to receive such instruction, for they know the 
truth but have set themselves against it and have turned the light of truth into darkness which is not dispelled. In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
The householder said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and 
lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2014:-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 14:-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom. Not those who are literally poor, maimed, lame, and blind 
are meant but those who are so in the spiritual sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said that they were to report to John: The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the 
dead are raised up, the poor have the gospel preached to them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%207:-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 7:-22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>According to the sense of the letter nobody else is meant by the blind, the lame, lepers, the deaf, the dead, and the poor 
than those who were so physically, for such cures did take place, that is to say, the blind received sight, the deaf hearing, lepers were restored to health, and the dead to life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 But in the 
internal sense the same people are meant as are referred to in </p>
<p>Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Then will be opened the eyes of the blind, and the ears of the deaf will be opened; then will the lame man leap like a hart, 
and the dumb man sing with his tongue. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2035:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 35: 5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming and a new Church at that time called the Church of the gentiles who are described as being blind, deaf, lame, 
and dumb; they were so called as regards their doctrine and life. For it should be recognized that all the miracles which the Lord performed always embodied such matters and therefore meant the things 
which the blind, the lame, lepers, the deaf, the dead, and the poor are used to mean in the internal sense. Consequently the Lord's miracles were Divine, as also those performed in Egypt, in the wilderness, 
and all the rest described in the Word, had been. This is an arcanum. </p>

ecce tenebrae; splendores, in caliginibus ambulamus; palpamus sicut caeci parietem, lix 9, 10: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Errarunt caeci in plateis, polluerunt se sanguine, ea quae non possunt, tangunt vestimentis 
[suis], Thren. iv 14; </p>
<p>pro quod omnia vera polluta sint, `platea' pro veris in quibus errarunt, n. 2336: [2] apud Zachariam, 	In die illo percutiam omnem equum stupore, et equitem ejus furore,... 
omnem equum populorum percutiam caecitate xii 4; </p>
<p>`equus' hic et alibi in Verbo pro intellectuali, inde dicitur quod `equus percuteretur stupore,' et quod `equus populorum percuteretur caecitate,' 
hoc est, oppleretur falsitatibus: [3] apud Johannem, 	In judicium Ego in mundum veri, ut non videntes videant, videntes vero caeci fiant: audiverunt ex Pharisaeis haec, dixerunt, Num etiam nos caeci 
sumus? Dixit illis Jesus, Si caeci essetis, non haberetis peccatum; jam autem dicitis, quod videamus {2} ideo peccatum vestrum manet, ix 39-41; </p>
<p>hic caeci in utroque sensu, qui nempe in falso et qui 
in ignorant veri; qui intra Ecclesiam et sciunt quid verum, `caecitas' apud eos e falsitas; at qui non sciunt quid verum, ut qui extra Ecclesiam, `caecitas' apud eos est ignorantia veri, qui inculpati: 
[4] apud eundem, 	Occaecavit (c)eorum oculos, et obturavit eorum cor, ut non videant oculis tuis, et intelligant corde, et sanem eos, xii 40; Esai. vi 9-11; </p>
<p>pro quod satius foret ut in falsitatibus 
essent quam in veris, quia in vita mali qui si instruerentur in veris, ea non solum adhuc falsificarent, sed etiam malis conspurcarent; ex simili causa qua viri Sodomae percussi sunt caecitatibus, hoc 
est, doctrinalia opplerentur falsitatibus; cur hoc fiat, ostensum est, n. 301-303, 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2426; [5] (m)quia `caecum' significabat falsum, ideo Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica 
prohibitum fuit sacrificare aliquod caecum, Lev. xxii 22; Deut. xv 21; Mal. i 8; tam vetitum quod caecus ex sacerdotibus accederet ad offerendum super altari, Lev. xxi 18, 21.(n) [6] Quod `caecitas' 
praedicetur de ignorantia veri, in quali sunt gentes, constat apud Esaiam, 	Audient in die illa surdi verba Libri, et ex caligine, eque tenebris oculi caecorum videbunt, xxix 18; </p>
<p>`caeci' pro illis 
qui in ignorantia veri, praecipue qui extra Ecclesiam apud eundem, 	Educ populum caelum, et oculi erunt; et surdos, et aures eis, xliii 8; </p>
<p>ubi de Ecclesia gentium: apud eundem, 	Ducam caecos in 
via non noverunt,... ponam tenebras 	coram iis in lucem, xlii 16: </p>
<p>[7] et apud eundem, 	Dabo Te in lucem populi, ad aperiendum oculos caecos, ad educendum e claustro vinctum, e domo carceris sedentes 
tenebris, xiii 6, 7; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini, quod tunc instruerentur illi qui in ignorantia veri; qui enim in falsitate sunt, ii se non ita patiuntur instrui, quia norunt verum, et confirmarunt se 
contra illud, et verterunt lucem in {3} tenebras, quae non discutiuntur: (m)apud Lucam, 	Dixit paterfamilias servo suo, Abi ocius in plateas {4} et vicos urbis, ac pauperes et mancos, et claudos, et 
caecos, introduc huc, xiv 21; </p>
<p>ubi de regno Domini; quod pauperes, manci, claudi, caeci non significentur, patet, sed qui in sensu spirituali tales sunt(n): [8] apud eundem, 	Dixit Jesus, ut renuntiarent 
Johanni: quod caeci videant, claudi ambulent, leprosi mundentur, surdi audiant, mortui resurgant, pauperibus evangelium praedicetur, vii 22; </p>
<p>secundum sensum litterae, per `caecos, claudos, leprosos, 
surdos, mortuos, pauperes' non alii intelliguntur quam tales, quia ita etiam factam, nempe quod caeci receperint visum, surdi auditum, leprosi sanitatem, mortui vitam, [9] sed usque in sensu interno 
intelliguntur iidem qui apud Esaiam, 	Tunc aperientur oculi caecorum, et aures surdorum aperientur, et saliet sicut cervus claudus, et cantabit lingua mutus, xxxv 5, 6; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini et 
de nova tunc Ecclesia quae vocatur gentium, de quibus praedicatur quod essent `caeci, surdi, claudi, muti,' ita dicti quoad doctrinam et vitam; nam sciendum, quod omnia miracula quae a Domino facta sunt, 
semper involverint talia, et inde significaverint quae per `caecos, claudos, leprosos, surdos, mortuos, pauperes' in sensu interno intelliguntur; inde miracula Domini fuerunt Divina, sicut etiam illa 
quae facta sunt in Aegypto, in deserto, et reliqua de quibus in Verbo; quod est arcanum. 	@1 dicantur.$ 	@2 quia videmus.$ 	@3 i veri.$ 	@4 ocyus in plateis I.$ </p>
