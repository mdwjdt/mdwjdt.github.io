<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第394节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>394.</strong>由于预见并规定了这一切，免得人类在永死中灭亡，所以此处声明不得向该隐施暴（该隐代表从仁分离之信），而且还在他身上立了记号，这意味着主为了保存信，便以特别的方式将它区分开。这些是迄今为止尚未揭开的奥秘，它们就是主在马太福音中论到婚姻和阉人时所说的意思：“因为有生来是阉人，也有被人阉的，并有为天堂的缘故自阉的。这话谁能领受，就可以领受。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.12.htm">19:12</a>）<br />处于天堂婚姻中的人被称为“阉人”；那些“生来是阉人”之人就是诸如类似属天天使的人；那些“被人阉的”之人是诸如类似属灵天使的人；而那些“自阉的”之人则诸如类似天使灵的人，他们出于仁行事的程度还未达到完全顺从的地步。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]394.</strong> Now, as these things were foreseen and provided in order to prevent the human race from dying an eternal death, the present verse says that no one was to do violence to Cain, who symbolizes a detached faith. It also says that a mark was placed on him, that is, that the Lord singled faith out in a special way in order to preserve it.<br />This is hidden knowledge that has never before come to light. The Lord had the same thing in mind when he spoke of marriage and of eunuchs in Matthew:<br />There are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb. And there are eunuchs who were made so by others. And there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of God's kingdom. Those who can understand, let them understand. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/bible_king-james-version_matthew_19_12" target=_top>Matthew 19:12</a>)<br />"Eunuch" applies to those who enter into the heavenly marriage.{*1} The ones who are like heavenly angels are called "those born so from their mother's womb." The ones who are like spiritual angels are called "those made so by others." The ones who are like angelic spirits, who participate in that marriage not so much from charity as from obedience, are called "those who made themselves so."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For Swedenborg, the ideal condition of man and woman is that they should be united as one, a spiritual marriage that occurs in heaven. On this same passage from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/bible_king-james-version_matthew_19_12" target=_top>Matthew 19:12</a>, compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_156#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Marriage Love 156:2</a>: "‘Eunuchs who make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God' means individuals who refrain from the evils of promiscuity in marriage. Clearly, it does not mean Italian eunuchs [that is, castrated men]." For more on the heavenly marriage, see notes 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54" target=_top>54</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a> in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155" target=_top>155</a>; for more on this sense of "eunuch," see Revelation Explained (Swedenborg 1994-1997) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_710#subsection-2-28" target=_top>710:28-30</a>.

Now as this was foreseen, and was provided, lest the human race should perish in eternal death, it is here declared that none should do violence to Cain, by whom is signified faith separated from charity; 
and further that a mark was set upon him, which means that the Lord distinguished faith in a particular manner, in order to secure its preservation. These are arcana hitherto undiscovered, and are 
referred to by the Lord in what He said respecting marriage, and eunuchs, in Matthew: </p>
<p>     There are eunuchs who were so born from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs 
of men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of God's sake; he that is able to receive it let him receive it (Matt. 19:12). Those in the heavenly marriage are called 
"eunuchs;" those so "born from the womb" are such as resemble the celestial angels; those "made of men" are such as are like the spiritual angels; and those "made so by themselves" are like angelic spirits, 
who act not so much from charity as from obedience. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 394</b></p><p><b>394.</b>
Now because this was foreseen and provision was made that the human race should not perish in eternal death, it is here said that 'nobody should do violence to Cain', who means separated faith. It is 
also said that a sign was put on him', that is, the Lord distinguished faith in a special way to ensure its preservation. These points are arcana which have not yet been disclosed. They are what the 
Lord meant in Matthew when He spoke about marriage and about eunuchs,  </p>
<blockquote>
There are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there 
are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God. He who is able to receive this let him receive it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>People with whom the heavenly marriage exists are 
called 'eunuchs'. 'Eunuchs born from the womb' are like celestial angels, 'those made so by men' are like spiritual angels, 'those who have made themselves eunuchs' are like angelic spirits, who are 
moved not so much by charity as by obedience.  </p>

</p><b>394.</b>
Nunc quia hoc praevisum et provisum est ne humanum genus aeterna morte periret, dicitur hic quod 'nemo violaret Cainum,' per quem significatur fides separata; et quod 'signum ei impositum,' hoc est, 
quod Dominus distinxerit illam singulari modo ut conservaretur: haec sunt arcana nusquam adhuc detecta; et sunt quae intellecta sunt a Domino, per illa quae locutus est de conjugio et de eunuchis apud 
Matthaeum, 	Sunt eunuchi, qui ex utero matris nati sunt sic: et sunt eunuchi, qui eunuchi facti sunt ab hominibus; et sunt eunuchi qui eunuchos fecerunt seipsos, propter regnum Dei; qui potest capere, 
ille capiat, xix 12; </p>
<p>'eunuchi' dicuntur qui in conjugio caelesti; 'ab utero nati' qui sicut angeli caelestes; 'facti ab hominibus' qui sicut angeli spirituales; 'qui seipsos fecerunt' sicut angelici 
spiritus, qui non ita ex charitate sed ex oboedientia. </p>
