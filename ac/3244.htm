<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3244节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3244.</strong>创世记25:5，6.亚伯拉罕将一切所有的都给了以撒。亚伯拉罕把礼物给了他所有的众妾的儿子们，趁着自己还在世的时候，打发他们离开他的儿子以撒、向东到东方之地去。<br />“亚伯拉罕将一切所有的都给了以撒”在至高意义上表神圣理性中的一切神性事物；在相对意义上则表被赋予主的属天国度的爱的属天事物。“亚伯拉罕把礼物给了他所有的众妾的儿子们”表那些被主的神性人所接纳的属灵之人，他们在主的属灵国度都有指定的地方。“打发他们离开他的儿子以撒”表那些属灵之人和那些属天之人的区分和分离。“趁着自己还在世的时候”表他能将生命赋予他们。“向东到东方之地去”表向着信之良善。</p>

Verses 5, 6. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was yet living, eastward 
to the land of the east. "And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac," signifies in the supreme sense all Divine things in the Divine rational; in the relative sense the celestial things of love 
in the Lord's celestial kingdom; "and to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts," signifies those who are spiritual adopted by the Lord's Divine Human, that they have allotted 
places in His spiritual kingdom; "and he sent them away from Isaac his son," signifies the distinction and separation of those who are spiritual from those who are celestial; "while he was yet living," 
signifies to whom he could give life; "eastward to the land of the east," signifies to the good of faith. </p>

Verses 5, 6 And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. And to the concubines' sons, whom Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from being with Isaac his son - while he was still living 
- eastwards to the land of the east. </p>
<p>'Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac' in the highest sense means all the Divine things within the Divine Rational, and in the relative sense the celestial 
things of love imparted to the Lord's celestial kingdom. 'And to the concubines' sons, whom Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts' means that places in the Lord's spiritual kingdom were allotted to those adopted 
by the Lord's Divine Human, namely those who were spiritual. 'And he sent them away from being with Isaac his son' means the distinguishing and separation of those who were spiritual from those 
who were celestial. 'While he was still riving' means to whom he was able to impart life. 'Eastwards to the land of the east' means towards the good of faith. </p>

Vers. 5, 6.  Et dedit Abraham omnia quae ei, Jishako. Et filiis concubinarum, qui Abrahamo, dedit Abraham dona; et misit illos ab apud Jishako filio suo, adhuc illo vivente, orientem versus ad terram 
orientis. `Dedit Abraham omnia quae ei, Jishako' significat in supremo sensu omnia Divina in Divino Rationali; in sensu respectivo, caelestia amoris regno caelesti Domini: `et filiis concubinarum, qui 
Abrahamo, dedit Abraham dona' significat spirituales adoptatos a Divino Humano Domini, quod illis sortes in regno spirituali Domina: `et misit illos ab apud Jishako filio suo' significat distinctionem 
et separationem spiritualium a caelestibus: `adhuc illo vivente' significat quibus vitam dare potuit: `orientem versus ad terram orientis' significat ad bonum fidei. </p>
