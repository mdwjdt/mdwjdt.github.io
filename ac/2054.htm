<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2054节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2054.</strong>“作永远的约”表结合。这从“约”的含义清楚可知，“约”是指结合，如前面所解释的。此处因论述的是那些教会中人，故再次提及“约”，只是这次它被称为“永约”。它在此被称为永约，既因对要受割礼的教会中人而言，从我欲和物欲当中洁净至关重要，如前所示（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>节），还因主及其天堂与他们有最紧密的结合，该结合通过信之良善与真理产生。诚然，那些教会外的人也有一个结合，但该结合相对遥远，因为他们并不在信之良善与真理当中，如前所述（<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>节）。在主的国度，教会就像人的心与肺。人的内层事物凭借心肺与那些外在事物联结，所有周边器官都以这种方式获得自己的生命。人类也一样：主及其天堂与教会结合得最紧密，而与那些教会外之人的结合相对遥远，他们就像凭借心肺存活的器官。属天之人类似心，而属灵之人类似肺。鉴于这两种人有洁净的必要性，故此处专门论述那些教会中人，并两次提及“约”。</p>

For an eternal covenant. That this signifies conjunction, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction, explained before. As those are here treated of who are within the church, 
the "covenant" is again spoken of; and it is here called an eternal covenant, both because it is most especially necessary for those within the church to be "circumcised," that is, purified from 
the loves of self and of the world (as shown above, n. 2051); and also because with them there is the nearest conjunction of the Lord and His heaven, since this is effected by means of the goods and 
truths of faith. There is indeed a conjunction with those also who are outside of the church, but a more remote one, because they are not in the goods and truths of faith (as before said, n. 2049). The 
church, in the Lord's kingdom, is circumstanced as are the heart and lungs in man. Man's interior things are conjoined with his external things by means of the heart and lungs, and from these live all 
the surrounding viscera. Such also is the case with the human race: the conjunction of the Lord and His heaven is nearest with the church, but more remote with those who are outside of the church, 
who are circumstanced as are the organs that live by means of the heart and lungs. The celestial are like the heart, and the spiritual are like the lungs. Because of the necessity for the purification 
of both of these, they who are within the church are here treated of specifically, and the "covenant" is stated twice. </p>

'As an eternal covenant' means conjunction. This is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as conjunction, dealt with already. The subject here being those inside the Church, the word 'covenant' is repeated, 
though this time it is called 'an eternal covenant'. It is repeated not only because it is absolutely vital for people inside the Church to be circumcised, that is, to be purified from self-love 
and love of the world, as shown above in <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, but also because the conjunction of the Lord and of His heaven with those inside the Church is the closest of all since it is effected through the goods 
and truths of faith. There is, it is true, a conjunction as well with those outside the Church, but that is more remote because the goods and truths of faith do not exist with them, as stated above 
in <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>. In the Lord's kingdom the Church is like the heart and lungs in man. Man's interior things are joined to those that are external by means of the heart and lungs, and in this way all the surrounding 
organs get their life. So it is with the human race as well. The conjunction of the Lord and of His heaven is closest with the Church, but more remote with those outside the Church who are like 
the organs which live by means of the heart and lungs. Celestial people resemble the heart, but spiritual people the lungs. The necessity for both of these to be purified is the reason why those inside 
the Church are dealt with specifically here and why the covenant is referred to twice. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2054</b>
</p><b>2054.</b>
`In foedus aeternum': quod significet conjunctionem, constat ex significatione `foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua prius.  Hic quia agitur de illis qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, iterum dicitur `foedus,' 
et hic `foedus aeternum,' ex causa, tam quia illis maxime necessarium circumcidi seu purificari ab amoribus sui et mundi, ut ostensum supra n. 2051, quam quia cum illis qui intra Ecclesiam, proxima 
(t)est conjunctio Domini (c)et Ipsius caeli, quoniam per bona et vera fidei: est quidem conjunctio etiam cum illis qui extra Ecclesiam, sed remotior quia non in bonis et veris fidei sunt, ut dictum 
supra n. (x)2049.  Ecclesia in regno Domini se habet sicut cor et pulmones in homine; interiora hominis cum externis ejus per cor et pulmones conjunguntur, inde omnia viscera quae circumcirca sunt, vivunt; 
ita quoque se habet cum genere humano; conjunctio Domini et Ipsius caeli est proxima cum Ecclesia, remotior autem cum illis qui extra Ecclesiam, qui sunt sicut viscera quae medio corde et pulmone 
vivunt: caelestes sunt instar cordis, spirituales autem instar pulmonum: illius et hujus necessitatis causa hic agitur in specie de illis qui intra Ecclesiam, et his repetitur foedus. </p>
