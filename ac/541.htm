<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第541节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>541.</strong>某些不识天堂之乐性质的灵被意外带进天堂。为了做到这一点，他们先被带到一种状态，即其身体的冲动和虚假的观念归于沉寂的状态。从那里我听到其中一个人对我说，现在他第一次感受到天堂的喜乐何等巨大，而他过去对它的误解何等深。但如今他于至内在感受到的快乐，远远胜过他曾体验到的诸如在肉身生活期间以之为乐的任何肉体快感，现在他认为那些快感是肮脏的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]541.</strong> Some who had no idea what heavenly joy was were abruptly carried up into heaven. They had been reduced to a condition in which they could be lifted up, their bodily desires and their delusions having been put to sleep. I heard one of them saying to me from there that now for the first time he could feel how much joy there was in heaven. He admitted that he had been grossly deceived, that he had held a very different view, and that he could now perceive the deepest degree of his own joy, which was immeasurably more than he had ever felt at the peak of any sensual experience during his physical existence. He called the pleasures that [he and his companions] usually enjoy foul. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 541</b></p><p><b>541.</b>
Certain spirits who were ignorant of the nature of heavenly joy were unexpectedly taken up into heaven after they had been brought into such a state as to render this possible, that is to say a state 
in which their bodily things and fanciful notions were lulled into quiescence. From there I heard one saying to me that now for the first time he felt how great is the joy in heaven, and that he had 
been very greatly deceived in having a different idea of it, but that now he perceived in his inmost being a joy immeasurably greater than he had ever felt in any bodily pleasure such as men are delighted 
with in the life of the body, and which he called foul. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 541</b></p><p><b>541.</b>
There were some who, not knowing what heavenly joy was, were carried away unexpectedly into heaven. To enable them to be taken up they had been brought into that state where the physical impulses and 
false notions have been lulled to sleep. I heard from there one of them telling me that he now felt for the first time how much joy there was in heaven, and that in holding to a different idea of it 
he had been grossly misled. In his inmost being he now felt this as something immeasurably superior to any pleasure men delight in during the life of the body, and which he called something base.  </p>

</p><b>541.</b>
Quidam qui nesciebant quid gaudium caeleste, inopinato sublati sunt in caelum; in statum illum redacti, ut attolli tunc possent, sopiti nempe quoad corporea et phantasias: inde audivi quendam ad me 
dicentem quod nunc primum sentiret quantum gaudii in caelo; et quod maximopere deceptus quod aliam ideam habuerit, et quod nunc intimum sui perciperet, indefinite majus quam usquam in summo alicujus voluptatis 
in vita corporis, quod vocabat spurcum, quo delectantur. </p>
