<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3396节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3396.</strong>创世记26:10，11.亚比米勒说，你这向我们作的是什么事呢？民中险些有人和你的妻子同寝，那你就给我们带来罪过了。于是亚比米勒吩咐众民说，凡沾着这男人和他妻子的，定要把他治死。<br />“亚比米勒说，你这向我们作的是什么事呢”表愤慨。“民中险些有人和你的妻子同寝，那你就给我们带来罪过了”表神圣真理有可能已经被玷污，从而被亵渎。“于是亚比米勒吩咐众民说”表法令。“凡沾着这男人和他妻子的，定要把他治死”表不可透露神圣真理和神圣良善，甚至不可通过信靠近它们，因为如果它们遭到亵渎，就有永恒诅咒的危险。</p>

Verses 10, 11. And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us, in that one of the people might lightly have lain with thy woman, and thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us? And Abimelech commanded 
all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man and his woman, dying he shall die. "And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us?" signifies indignation; "that one of the people might 
lightly have lain with thy woman, and thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us," signifies that Divine truth might have been adulterated and thus profaned; "and Abimelech commanded all the people, 
saying," signifies a decree; "he that toucheth this man and his woman, dying he shall die," signifies that Divine truth and Divine good are not to be opened; and are not even to be approached in faith, 
on account of the danger of eternal damnation if they should be profaned. </p>

Verses 10, 11 And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us. And Abimelech commanded all the people, 
saying, Anyone touching this man and his wife will surely die. 'Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us?' means anger. 'One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you 
would have brought guilt on us' means that it could have been adulterated and so profaned. 'And Abimelech commanded all the people, saying' means a decree. 'Anyone touching this man and his wife will 
surely die' means that Divine Truth and Divine Good were not to be disclosed, insomuch that not even any approach was to be made towards them by faith because of the danger of eternal condemnation if 
they were profaned. </p>

Vers. 10, 11.  Et dixit Abimelech, Quid hoc fecisti nobis? ut parum cubaret unus populi cum muliere tua, et adduxisses super nos reatum. Et praecepit Abimelech omni populo, dicendo, Tangens virum illum 
et mulierem ejus, moriendo morietur. `Dixit Abimelech, Quid hoc fecisti nobis?' significat indignationem: `ut parum cubaret unus populi cum muliere tua, et adduxisses super nos reatum' significat 
quod adulterari potuisset et sic profanari: `et praecepit Abimelech omni populo, dicendo' significat decretum: `Tangens virum illum et mulierem ejus, moriendo morietur' significat quod Divinam Verum et 
Divinum Bonum non aperiendum, et usque ad illud non accedendum fide, ex periculo damnationis aeternae si profanaretur. </p>
