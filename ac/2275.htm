<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2275.</strong>“亚伯拉罕说，求我主不要动怒，我要说”表对人类状态的深切忧虑。这一点从这些话不如从这些话所包含的情感看得那样清楚。圣言的内义包含两种不同的元素，即属灵元素和属天元素。属灵元素在于一种洞察力，从文字当中抽象出来，是字义作为一种物体所服务的真实事物。字义和眼睛所看到的事物一样，眼见之物就是服务于思想更高尚事务的物体。而属天元素则在于对属内义的真实事物里面所存在情感的纯粹直觉。属灵天使具有对真实事物的洞察力，而属天天使则具有对这情感的纯粹直觉。后者，也就是情感的觉知者，在世人阅读文字时，唯独通过情感立刻发觉文字所包含的东西，并由此为自己形成属天观念。他们以无穷的多样性和无法形容的方式，照着构成那情感的爱之属天事物的次序与和谐而这样做。由此可见，主的圣言就包含在它的深层隐蔽处。因此，当读到这些话，即“求我主不要动怒，我要说”时，属天天使立刻发觉一种深切的忧虑，事实上是对人类之爱的深切忧虑。同时，与主在思想人类状态时所感受到的深切忧虑有关的无数难以描述的事物也被注入到他们里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2275</b></p><p><b>2275.</b>
And he said, Oh let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak. That this signifies anxiety concerning the state of the human race, may be seen, not so much from the words, as from the affection that belongs 
to them. The internal sense of the Word contains within it two things, to wit, what is spiritual, and what is celestial. That which is spiritual consists in there being comprehended, abstractedly 
from the letter, actual things to which the literal sense serves as an object, just as do those things which the eye sees, when they serve as objects for suggesting thought about matters of a more exalted 
nature. That which is celestial consists in there being solely perceived the affection that belongs to the actual things that are in the internal sense. In the former are the spiritual angels, in 
the latter are the celestial angels. They who are in the latter, that is, in the affection, perceive at once from the affection alone what the letter involves when it is being read by man, and from 
it they form for themselves celestial ideas, and this with endless variety, and in an ineffable manner, in accordance with the onflowing harmony of the celestial things of love that are in the affection. 
From this we may see what the Word of the Lord contains within its remote recesses. When therefore these words are read: "Oh let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak," the celestial angels at once 
perceive a certain anxiety, and indeed the anxiety of love toward the human race; and at the same time there are insinuated into them innumerable and ineffable things in regard to the anxiety of love 
which the Lord felt when He thought about the state of the human race. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2275</b></p><p><b>2275.</b>
That 'he said, Let not now my Lord be incensed, and I will speak' means deep concern over the state of the human race becomes clear not so much from the actual words as from the affection which these 
words have within them. The internal sense of the Word consists of two distinct elements - the spiritual and the celestial. The spiritual involves a discernment - abstractedly, apart from the letter 
of subject matter or real things, the literal sense serving these as an object, in the same way as things seen with the eye may serve as objects of thought regarding more exalted matters. The celestial 
involves pure perception of the affection present within the real things which belong to the internal sense. That discernment of real things exists with spiritual angels, whereas this pure perception 
of that affection exists with celestial angels. The latter, that is, those who are percipients of the affection, perceive immediately, purely from the affection there, what the letter embodies within 
itself when this is being read by man. And from this they form celestial ideas for themselves, doing so with unending variety and in an indescribable fashion in accordance with the sequence and harmony 
of the celestial things of love comprising the affection. This shows what the Word of the Lord contains in its inner recesses. When these words are being read therefore, 'Let not now my Lord be incensed, 
and I will speak', celestial angels perceive immediately a certain deep concern, and indeed that deep concern that is a manifestation of love towards the human race. At the same time countless 
and indescribable aspects regarding the deep concern which the Lord felt when He thought about the state of the human race are instilled into them. </p>

</p><b>2275.</b>
`Et dixit, Ne quaeso succenseatur Domino meo, et loquar': quod significet anxietatem de statu generis humani, non ita ex verbi' sed ex affectione eorundem constare potest: sunt bina in sensu interno 
Verbi, nempe spirituale et caeleste; spirituale est quod comprehendantur res abstracte a littera, quibus litteralis sensus inservit pro objecto, sicut sunt illa quae videt oculus cum inserviunt pro objectis 
cogitandi de sublimioribus; caeleste est quod solum percipiatur affectio rerum quae in sensu interno; in illo sunt angeli spirituales, in hoc autem angeli caelestes; qui in hoc sunt seu in affectione, 
percipiunt ilico quid littera involvit cum legitur ab homine, ex sola affectione, et ex ea formant sibi ideas caelestes, et hoc cum innumerabili varietate, (m)et ineffabili modo secundum consensum 
succedentem caelestium amoris qui in affectione {1} (n); inde constare potest quid Verbum Domini in recessu habet: cum itaque haec leguntur, `ne quaeso succenseatur Domini meo, et loquar,' angeli 
caelestes ilico percipiunt anxietatem quandam et quidem anxietatem amoris erga genus humanum, et simul tunc innumerabilia et {2} ineffabilia de anxietate amoris quae Domino, cum cogitavit de statu generis 
humani, illis insinuantur. 	@1 quae.$ 	@2 imo.$ </p>
