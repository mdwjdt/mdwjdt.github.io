<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1769节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1769.</strong>有一个灵人来找我，我从以下事实判断他刚离世不久：即他尚不知道自己已进入来世，还以为自己仍在世上。我发觉他一直致力于学术研究，我便与他谈论这事。但就在这时，他突然被举到高处，这令我愕然。我猜测他是那种崇尚高级事物的人，因为这种人通常被举到高处。或者，他以为天堂在极高之处，因为这种人同样常被举到高处，以便他们通过亲身体验知道，天堂不在高处，而在于内在之物。<br />但我很快发现，他被提到了位于正前方稍向右一点的天使灵那里，就在天堂的入口处。然后，他从那里与我对话，声称他看到的事物如此高尚，根本不是人类头脑所能领悟的。这事发生的时候，我正在读申命记第一章，是关于犹太人的，即他们如何打发人窥探迦南地，看看那里有什么。当我读这一章时，他说，他对字义上的事物毫无觉察，只感知到灵义上的事物，这些都是奇迹，远非他所能描述的。这还只是天使灵天堂的门槛，那么在那天堂自身里面必有何等奇迹！而在天使天堂又必有何等奇迹！<br />当时，与我同在的一些灵人因原来不相信主的圣言具有这样的性质，故开始忏悔他们的不信。他们说，在当前的状态下，他们已相信，因为他们听见那个灵人声称他已经听到看到，并发觉这是事实。<br />但有些灵人仍坚持不信，声称那不是真的，全都是幻觉。所以，他们也被突然举到高处，从那里与我说话。他们现在坦承确有其事，不是幻觉。因为他们现在真实地感觉到事情的确如此，事实上，他们的感知远比活在肉身时所能被赋予的任何感觉还要敏锐。<br />不久之后，也有些灵人被提到那个天堂。其中一个人活在肉身时我就认识他，他也作了类似见证。他还说了其中一件事：他因圣言的内义而神魂颠倒，以至于难以描述它。此时此刻，他怀着某种怜悯之情说，奇怪的是，世人对这类事物一无所知。另外，他说，他从那里能深入洞察我的思维和情感，在它们里面觉察到他难以尽述的更多事物，如原因、流注，它们出自何处，从谁那里来，又如我的观念，它们如何与世俗事物混合，并且这些是完全分离的等等。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1769.</strong> A spirit came to me not long after he had left his body. (This I could tell from the fact that he did not yet realize he was in the other life but believed he was still living in the world.) I sensed that he had devoted his time to intellectual pursuits, which I discussed with him, but then to my amazement he suddenly soared into the air. I decided he was the type of person whose ambitions had been lofty (since people like this usually rise into the air) or that he thought heaven was at the top of the sky. (This kind of person too is usually raised aloft, in order to learn that heaven is not up high but deep within.)<br />[2] I soon perceived, though, that he had been lifted up to a group of angelic spirits positioned a little out in front and to the right, on the first threshold of heaven. He then spoke to me from there, saying that he was seeing sights grander than the human mind could ever conceive. While this was happening, I was reading in the first chapter of Deuteronomy about the Jewish people, specifically the ones sent to scout out the land of Canaan and all that it held. As I was reading it, he said that he caught none of the contents of the literal meaning but only those of the spiritual meaning, which were too astounding to describe.<br />This occurred on the very threshold of the angelic spirits' heaven. What would it be like in their heaven proper, or in the heaven of true angels?<br />[3] Then certain spirits present with me, who had previously doubted that the Lord's Word was like this, began to regret their disbelief. In their present state, they said they believed, because they had heard from the spirit that he heard, saw, and perceived it to be so.<br />[4] Other spirits, however, stood by their disbelief and kept saying it was not true, it was all imagination. So they too were suddenly swept up high. They talked to me from there and confessed that it was anything but imagination, because they really perceived that it was true. In fact they perceived it more keenly than would ever be possible with any of the senses available during physical life.<br />[5] Soon others too were raised into the same heaven, including someone known to me in bodily life. He gave the same testimony, saying among other things that he was too dumbfounded to describe the glory of the Word in its inner sense. Speaking with a kind of pity, he expressed astonishment that humans were completely unaware of such things.<br />What is more, he said that from there he could peer deeply into my thoughts and feelings. In them he saw more than he could tell — what caused them, how they interacted, where they came from, who inspired them, how the mental images mingled with earthly sediment, the need to separate the two completely, and so on. </p>

A certain spirit came to me not long after his departure from the body, as I was able to infer from the fact that he did not yet know that he was in the other life, but supposed that he was living in 
the world. It was perceived that he had been devoted to studies, concerning which I spoke with him. But he was suddenly taken up on high; and, surprised at this, I imagined that he was one of those who 
aspire to high things, for such are wont to be taken up on high; or else that he placed heaven at a great height, for such likewise are often carried up on high, that they may know from experience 
that heaven is not in what is high, but in what is internal.  [2] But I soon perceived that he was taken up to the angelic spirits, who were in front, a little to the right, at the entrance to heaven. 
He then spoke with me from thence, saying that he saw things more sublime than human minds could at all comprehend. While this was taking place, I was reading the first chapter of Deuteronomy, about 
the Jewish people, in that men were sent to explore the land of Canaan and what was in it. While I was reading this, he said that he perceived nothing of the sense of the letter, but the things in the 
spiritual sense, and that these were wonders which he could not describe. This was in the first entrance to the heaven of angelic spirits; what wonders then would be perceived in that heaven itself! 
and what in the angelic heaven!  [3] Certain spirits who were with me, and who before had not believed that the Word of the Lord is of such a nature, then began to repent of their unbelief; they said, 
in that state, that they believed because they heard the spirit say that he heard, saw, and perceived that it was so.  [4] But other spirits still persisted in their unbelief, and said that it was 
not so, but that these things were fancies; and therefore they too were suddenly taken up, and spoke with me from thence; and they confessed that it was anything but fancy, because they really perceived 
that it was so; and by a more exquisite perception indeed than can ever be given to any sense during the life of the body.  [5] Soon others also were taken up into the same heaven, and among them 
one whom I had known in the life of the body, who testified to the same effect, saying also, among other things, that he was too much amazed to be able to describe the glory of the Word in its internal 
sense. Then, speaking from a kind of pity, he said that it was strange that men knew nothing at all of such things. He said further that from where he then was he could look most deeply into my thoughts 
and my affections, and perceived in them more things than he could tell; such as causes, influxes, whence they came, and from whom; the ideas, and how they were mixed with earthly things, and that 
these were to be wholly separated; besides other things. </p>

A certain spirit came to me not long after he had departed this life. This I was able to deduce from the fact that he still did not know that he had entered the next life but supposed that he was living 
in the world. I perceived that he had been a person dedicated to scholarly pursuits, about which I spoke to him. But at that moment he was suddenly carried up on high, which amazed me. I presumed 
that he was one of those people who had aspired to high things, since such people are usually taken up on high; or else that he was one of those who imagined heaven to be far away up on high and who likewise 
are usually taken away up on high, so that from up there they may know that heaven does not exist up on high but in what is internal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But shortly after that I noticed that he was carried 
up to the angelic spirits who were in a forward position and slightly to the right, on the very threshold of heaven. From there he then spoke to me, saying that he saw things more exalted than human 
minds could ever take in. While all this was happening I was reading Deuteronomy <a href="1.htm">1</a>, about the Jewish people - how the men were sent to explore the land of Canaan and what was in it. As I read it he said 
that he discerned nothing of that which occurs in the sense of the letter, only the things in the spiritual sense, and that these were marvels beyond his powers of description. This was merely at 
the threshold of the heaven of angelic spirits, so what must the marvels be within that heaven itself, and what must they be within the angelic heaven! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Certain spirits who were with me at the time, 
and who had not previously believed that the Word of the Lord was of such a nature, began to repent of their unbelief. They said that in their present state they now believed because they had heard 
that spirit say he had heard, seen, and perceived that it was so. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But other spirits continued in their unbelief, saying that it was not so but all a delusion. They also were therefore suddenly 
carried up, and spoke to me from where they were. They now confessed that it was anything but a delusion, for now they perceived from amid spiritual realities that it was so, their perception indeed 
being far keener than can possibly be imparted to any of the senses during the life of the body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Shortly afterwards others also were carried up into the same heaven. I had known one of them during 
his lifetime, and he bore similar witness. Among other things he also said that he was so dazed by the glory of the Word in its internal sense that he was unable to describe it. Speaking at this 
time with some kind of compassion he said it was remarkable that people on earth know nothing at all of such matters. He said in addition that from where he was he was able to see deeply into my thoughts 
and my affections, perceiving in them more things than he could mention, such as causes; such as influxes - where these come from, and from whom; such as my ideas, how they were mingled with earthly 
things, and that these were to be completely separated; besides many other things. </p>

</p><b>1769.</b>
Quidam spiritus ad me venit non diu post excessum ejus e corpore, quod concludere potui ex eo quod adhuc nesciret se in altera vita esse, putans se vivere in mundo; perceptum quod is deditus fuerit 
studiis, de quibus locutus cum eo; sed tunc subito sublatus est in altum, quod miratus; autumabam quod esset ab illis qui alta spirarunt, nam tales solent in altum ferri; aut quod posuerit caelum in altissimo, 
qui similiter solent in altum auferri, ut inde sciant quod caelum non sit in alto sed in interno; [2] sed mox appercepi quod sublatus sit ad spiritus angelicos qui antrorsum paulo ad dextrum 
in primo caeli limine; inde dein mecum locutus est, dicens quod sublimiora videat quam usquam mentes humanae capere possent; cum hoc fiebat, legebam caput I Deut., de populo Judaico, quod missi sint 
qui explorarent terram Canaanem et quae ibi; quod cum legerem, dixit quod nihil apperciperet quae in sensu litterae sed quae in sensu spirituali, et quod haec mirabilia, quae describere non posset: hoc 
erat in primo limine caeli spirituum angelicorum; quid non in ipso illo caelo, et quid non in caelo angelico.  [3] Spiritus quidam tunc qui apud me erant, prius increduli quod tale sit Verbum Domini, 
coeperunt paenitere quod non crediderint; dicebant in illo statu quod credant, quia audiverunt illum dixisse quod audiverit, viderit et perceperit ita esse.  [4] Sed alii spiritus adhuc in sua incredulitate 
perstabant, et dicebant non ita esse, sed esse phantasias; quare etiam hi subito sublati sunt inde mecum locuti, et fassi, quod nihil minus sit quam phantasia, quia realiter percipiunt quod ita 
sit, e quidem perceptione exquisitiore quam usquam dari possit alicui sensui in vita corporis.  [5] Mox etiam alii in idem caelum sublati, et inter eos unus in vita corporis mihi notus, qui idem testatus, 
inter alia etiam dicens quod prae stupore gloriam Verbi in sensu illius interno describere non posset; ex miseratione quadam tunc loquens, inquiit, mirum esse quod homines ne hilum ex talibus 
sciant: praeterea dixit quod inde cogitationes meas et affectiones meas intueri penitus posset, in quibus perciperet plura quam potuisset edicere, sicut causas, influxus unde et a quibus, ideas quomodo 
mixtae essent terrenis, et quod separandae omnino, praeter alia. </p>
