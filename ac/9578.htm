<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9578节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9578.</strong>主通过天使把我带到某个宇宙星球，在那里，我被允许观看这个星球本身，但不允许与住在上面的人交谈，只允许与来自该星球的灵人交谈。每个星球的所有居民或人们结束在世上的生命后，都会变成灵人，留在他们自己的星球周围。然而，这些灵人给予了有关他们星球及其居民状态的信息；因为当人们离开肉体时，他们会带走自己以前的一切生命和一切记忆。</p>

ON THE EARTHS IN THE STARRY HEAVEN; HERE, ON THE FIRST EARTH SEEN THERE. By means of angels from the Lord I was conducted to a certain earth in the universe, where it was granted me to look at the earth 
itself; but not to speak with the inhabitants of it, but with the spirits who came from it. For after their life in the world is completed, all the inhabitants, or men, of every earth, become spirits, 
and remain about their earth. Nevertheless these give information about their earth, and the state of its inhabitants; for men who depart out of the body carry with them all their former life, and 
all their memory. </p>

PLANETS OUT IN SPACE - THE FIRST PLANET THERE WHICH I HAVE SEEN  </p>
<p>I was conveyed by the Lord by means of angels to some planet in the universe, where I was allowed to see into the actual planet but 
not to talk to those inhabiting it, only to spirits who had originated from there; for all the inhabitants or people of any planet whatever become spirits after the life they have led in the world, and 
they remain around their own planet. From them however knowledge is obtained regarding their planet and the state of those inhabiting it; for when people depart from the body they take all their previous 
life and all their memory with them.  </p>

De Telluribus in Caelo Astrifero, hic de Prima Tellure ibi visa </p>
<p>Ducebar per angelos a Domino ad tellurem quandam in universo, ubi datum est inspicere in ipsam tellurem, sed non loqui cum incolis 
ibi, verum cum spiritibus qui inde; omnes enim incolae, seu homines cujuscumque telluris, post transactam vitam in mundo fiunt spiritus, et manent circa suam tellurem; ex illis tamen informatio datur 
de tellure, et de statu incolarum ibi; nam homines qui decedunt e corpore, secum ferunt omnem vitam priorem et omnem memoriam. </p>
