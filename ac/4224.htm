<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4224.</strong>器官形式不仅包括那些肉眼可见或通过显微镜所观察到的形式，还包括无法以肉眼看到或用任何人工设备所观察到的更精纯的形式。这些更精纯的形式更为内在，就是诸如属于内在视觉，在目的上属于理解或认知的那类形式。这些是无法测寻的，但仍是形式，也就是实质；因为视觉，甚至理性视觉离了某种事物是不可能的。这一点在学术界也是众所周知的，也就是说，没有实质，也就是主体，就没有任何模式，没有任何限定，也就没有以活跃的方式显现它自己的任何品质。这些无法测寻的更精纯或更内在的形式，就是那些形成并发出人的内在感官，以及产生其内层情感的形式。天上的内层事物就对应于这些形式，因为内层天堂对应于它们所发出的内在感官及其内层情感。不过，关于这些天堂及其对应关系，有很多事已向我透露，只是它们无法阐述清楚，除非各自予以单独阐述。因此，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将继续阐述这个从前一卷就开始的主题，即人与大人的对应关系，以便让人最终不再凭任何推理，更不再凭任何纯粹的猜测，而是凭实际经验去了解他自己的存在状态，及其被称为灵魂的内在人，最终了解他如何与天堂并通过天堂与主联结。到那时，他将知道是什么使得人成为一个人，是什么将他与动物区别开来。另外，他将知道人如何使自己脱离与天堂并主的这种联结，并将自己与地狱联结起来。</p>

Organic forms are not only those apparent to the eye, and that can be detected by microscopes; for there are also organic forms still more pure, which can never be discovered by any eye, whether naked 
or assisted. The latter forms are interior forms such as are those of the internal sight, and which in the last analysis are of the understanding. These are inscrutable, but still they are forms, that 
is, substances; for no sight, not even intellectual sight, is possible except from something. This is also known in the learned world; that is to say, that without a substance, which is the subject, 
there is not any mode, nor any modification, nor any quality which manifests itself in an active manner. These purer or interior forms which are inscrutable, are those which form and set forth the internal 
senses, and also produce the interior affections. It is to these forms that the interior things of heaven correspond, because they correspond to the senses which they set forth, and to the affections 
of these senses. But as very many things have been disclosed to me respecting these matters and their correspondence, they cannot be clearly presented unless each one is treated of specifically; 
and therefore of the Lord's Divine mercy I may continue below the consideration of the subject of the correspondence of man with the Grand Man that was commenced in a preceding volume, to the intent 
that man may at last know, not from any ratiocination, and still less from any hypothesis, but from experience itself, how the case is with him, and with his internal man which is called his soul, and 
in consequence with his conjunction with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord; and consequently whence man is man, and by what he is distinguished from beasts; and furthermore, how man himself 
separates himself from this conjunction, and conjoins himself with hell. </p>

Organic forms consist not merely in those which are visible to the eye or which can be discovered by means of microscopes. Still purer organic forms exist which cannot possibly be discovered by any naked 
eye or any artificial device. These purer forms are more internal, such as the forms which belong to internal sight, and which in the end belong to the understanding. These are unsearchable, but 
are nevertheless forms, that is, substances, since no sight, not even intellectual sight, is possible except that which exists from something beyond itself. This is also well known in the learned world, 
that is to say, the point that without substance which is the subject, no mode, nor any modification, nor any quality which manifests itself in an active manner is possible. Those purer or more internal 
forms which are unsearchable are those which give rise to man's internal senses, as well as producing his interior affections. And these are the forms to which the interior heavens correspond since 
the interior heavens correspond to those internal senses and interior affections. But as there are very many things which have been disclosed to me concerning those heavens and their correspondence, 
they cannot be presented clearly unless each one is dealt with separately. For that reason, in the Lord's Divine mercy let the subject of the correspondence of man with the Grand Man begun in the previous 
volume be continued below. This will enable anyone to know, not on the basis of any reasoning, still less of any mere speculation, but from actual experience, about his own state of being, about 
his internal man which is called his soul, and lastly about how he is joined to heaven and through heaven to the Lord. He will then know about what it is that makes anyone a human being and what it 
is that marks him off from animals. In addition he will know about how a person separates himself from that conjunction with heaven and the Lord and joins himself to hell. </p>

Formae organicae non solum sunt illae quae apparent coram oculo et quae detegi possunt per microscopia, sed etiam sunt formae organicae adhuc puriores quae nusquam aliquo oculo nudo nec artificiali 
detegi possunt, `hae formae sunt interiores; sicut formae quae sunt visus interni et quae denique sunt intellectus; </p>
<p>hae sunt imperscrutabiles, sed usque sunt formae, (o)hoc est, substantiae; non 
enim potest aliquis visus, ne quidem intellectualis, existere quam ab aliquo; hoc {1} etiam notum est in orbe erudito, quod nempe absque substantia quae subjectum, non sit aliquis modus seu aliqua 
modificatio seu (x)aliquod quale quod se active manifestat; formae illae puriores seu interiores quae imperscrutabiles, sunt quae sensus internos sistunt, et quoque affectiones interiores producunt: 
cum illis formis quia cum illarum sensibus et horum affectionibus, correspondent caeli interiores: </p>
<p>sed quia de illis et de correspondentia illorum, plura sunt quae mihi detecta [sunt], illa non 
possunt clare exponi, nisi de singulis in specie agatur, quapropter etiam in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, licet continuare illa quae de correspondentia hominis cum Maximo Homine in priore 
Parte incohata sunt; ut tandem sciat homo, non ex aliqua ratiocinatione, minus ex aliqua hypothesi, sed ab ipsa experientia, quomodo se cum illo habet, et cum interno ejus homine qui anima ejus 
vocatur, et denique cum conjunctione ejus cum caelo et per caelum cum Domino, consequenter unde homo est homo, et per quae distinguitur a bestiis; et porro quomodo homo semet ipsum a conjunctione 
illa separat, et se cum inferno conjungit.      @1 quod$ </p>
