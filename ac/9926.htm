<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9926节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9926.</strong>“他的响声必被听见”表在那些在天上和地上之人当中的真理的流注。这从“被听见”和“响声”的含义清楚可知：“被听见”是指接受和感知（参看<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>，<a href="5471.htm">5471</a>，<a href="5475.htm">5475</a>，<a href="7216.htm">7216</a>，<a href="8361.htm">8361</a>，<a href="9311.htm">9311</a>节），因而也指流注，因为被接受和感知的事物必流入；“响声”当论及代表主的亚伦时，是指神性真理（参看<a href="8813.htm">8813</a>节）。因为“响声”表示对这真理的宣告，由于所表示的是宣告，故所表示的是在那些在天上和地上之人当中的真理。神性真理充满天堂的一切，并构成教会的一切。当亚伦进圣所到耶和华面前的时候，以及当他出来的时候，如本节经文接下来所说的那样，金铃铛发出的“响声”或声音就代表这种宣告， <br />在圣言中，“响声”表示在天上和地上被听见和感知到的神性真理，这一点从下列经文明显看出来，诗篇：<br />耶和华的响声发在水上；耶和华的响声大有能力；耶和华的呼声满有威严；耶和华的响声音震破香柏树；耶和华的响声使火焰分岔；耶和华的响声使旷野震动；耶和华的响声使母鹿落胎。凡在祂殿中的，都说，荣耀啊！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.3.htm">29:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这段诗篇所论述的主题是摧毁虚假和邪恶的神性真理；这神性真理就是“耶和华的响声”；而所说的“荣耀”表示存在于天堂和教会中的神性真理。“荣耀”是指神性真理（参看<a href="9429.htm">9429</a>节）；“殿”是指天堂和教会（<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。<br />约翰福音：<br />祂是羊的牧人，看门的就给他开门，羊也听他的响声。羊也跟着祂，因为认得祂的响声。羊不跟着生人，因为不认得生人的响声。我另外有羊，不是这圈里的；我必须领他们来，他们也要听我的响声。你们不是我的羊，因为我的羊听我的响声，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.2.htm">10:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.27.htm">27</a>）<br />此处显而易见，“响声”表示从主发出的神性真理，就是圣言；“生人的响声”是指虚假。<br />以赛亚书：<br />有人的响声在旷野喊着，预备耶和华的路。耶和华的荣耀必然显现。那响声说，锡安哪，要登上高山，报好信息。耶路撒冷啊，要极力扬起响声；说，看哪，主耶和华必以大能临到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">40:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">10</a>；以及约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.23.htm">1:23</a>）<br />“响声”在此表示从圣言宣告关于主降临的事，因此也表示圣言所宣告的神性真理；“旷野”是指那时教会的状态，可以说是在旷野中，因为圣言不再被人理解；“必然显现的荣耀”是指就其内层而言的圣言（关于“荣耀”的这层含义，可参看<a href="9429.htm">9429</a>节）。预备路所为的“耶和华”和必以大能临到的“主耶和华”明显是指主，因为这是经上明确说的。<br />以赛亚书：<br />你守望之人的响声，他们扬起响声来，他们必眼对眼地看见，耶和华归回锡安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.8.htm">52:8</a>）<br />“守望之人”表示那些查究关于主降临的经文之人，他们“声音”是指圣言，也就是作为源头的神性真理。耶利米书：<br />祂造了大地，用祂的聪明展开诸天；祂一发声，天上便有多水。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.12.htm">5:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.6.htm">51:6</a>）<br />“响声”在此表示神性真理；“多水”表示在众天堂中并来自众天堂的真理。在圣言中，“水”表示真理（参看<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>节）。在下列经文中也是如此：<br />人子的响声如同众水的声音。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.15.htm">1:15</a>）<br />启示录：<br />我听见从天上有响声，像众水的响声。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.2.htm">14:2</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华的响声发在众水上，耶和华在大水之上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.3.htm">29:3</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />耶和华在祂的军队前头发出响声；因为遵行祂话语的，不可数算。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.11.htm">2:11</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“响声”也表示神性真理，同样表示他们所遵行的圣言。同一先知书：<br />耶和华必从耶路撒冷发出响声，天地就震动。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.16.htm">3:16</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />地上的列国啊，你们要歌颂那自古乘驾在太古天之天以上的主。看哪，祂要发出响声，是威严的响声。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.32.htm">68:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.33.htm">33</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />我对你们说，时候将到，死人要听见神儿子的响声，听见的人就要活了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.25.htm">5:25</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“响声”表示神性真理，因而表示主的圣言，这是显而易见的。<br />以西结书：<br />灵将我举起，我就听见在我身后有大地震的响声，说，耶和华的荣耀是该称颂的！我又听见那活物翅膀的响声，轮子的响声，大地震的响声。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.12.htm">3:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.13.htm">13</a>）<br />之后：<br />基路伯翅膀的响声听到外院，好像沙代神说话的响声。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.5.htm">10:5</a>）<br />此处“响声”也指神性真理；因为“基路伯”表示主的天命和守卫，防止没有通过爱之良善就靠近祂自己和天堂（<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>e，<a href="9509.htm">9509</a>节）；“翅膀的响声”和“轮子的响声”是指属灵真理。<br />在论述亚伦的本节经文中，“响声”所指的，正是铃铛发出的响声或铃声。在圣言的其它经文中，号声或号的轰鸣，以及雷声和雷轰也被称为“响声”；这些同样表示神性真理（参看<a href="7573.htm">7573</a>节）。此外，各种乐器的声音也有类似含义；但发出刺耳、离散声音的乐器表示神性属灵真理；而发出连续声音的乐器表示神性属天真理（<a href="418.htm">418</a>-<a href="420.htm">420</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="8337.htm">8337</a>节）。由此明显可知，铃铛的声音或“响声”表示神性属灵真理；因为亚伦的衣服，尤其周围底边上有铃铛的外袍代表主的属灵国度或天堂（<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>，<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节）。</p>

And the voice thereof shall be heard. That this signifies the influx of truth with those who are in the heavens and who are on earth, is evident from the signification of "being heard," as being reception 
and perception (see n. 5017, 5471, 5475, 7216, 8361, 9311), consequently also influx, because the things which are received and perceived must flow in; and from the signification of "the voice," 
when said of Aaron, by whom is represented the Lord, as being Divine truth (see n. 8813); for "the voice" denotes the annunciation of this truth, and because it denotes its annunciation, it exists with 
those who are in the heavens and on earth. For Divine truth fills all things of heaven, and makes all things of the church. Such an annunciation was represented by the voice from the bells of gold, 
when Aaron went in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when he came out, as is said in what now follows in this verse. [2] That in the Word a "voice" signifies the Divine truth which is heard and 
perceived in the heavens and on earth, is evident from the following passages. In David: </p>
<p>     The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters; the voice of Jehovah is in power; the voice of Jehovah is with honor; 
the voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; the voice of Jehovah cleaveth as a flame of fire; the voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness to tremble; the voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve; 
but in His temple everyone saith, Glory (Ps. 29:3-9). In this psalm Divine truth is treated of, in that it destroys falsities and evils; this Divine truth is "the voice of Jehovah;" but the "glory" 
which is spoken of denotes the Divine truth in heaven and in the church. (That "glory" denotes the Divine truth, see n. 9429; and that the "temple" denotes heaven and the church, n. 3720.) [3] In John: </p>
<p> 
    To Him who is the Shepherd of the sheep the doorkeeper openeth; and the sheep hear His voice. The sheep follow Him, because they know His voice. A stranger they follow not, because they know 
not the voice of strangers. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also   I must bring, and they shall hear My voice. But ye are not of My sheep, for My sheep hear My voice, and I know 
them, and they follow Me (John 10:2-5, 16, 26, 27). That the "voice" here denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Word, is very evident; "the voice of strangers" denotes falsity. [4] 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, for the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed. The voice saith, Cry. O Zion, that tellest good tidings, 
get thee up upon the high mountain! O Jerusalem, that tellest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength! lift it up. Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength (Isa. 40:3, 5, 6, 9, 10; also John 1:23). "The 
voice" here denotes annunciation from the Word about the coming of the Lord, thus it also denotes the Divine truth which the Word announces; "the wilderness" denotes the state of the church 
at that time, which was as it were in the wilderness because the Word was no longer understood; "the glory which shall be revealed" denotes the Word as to its interiors. (That this is meant by "glory," 
may be seen above, n. 9429.) That "Jehovah, for whom a way was to be prepared," and "the Lord Jehovih, who should come in strength," denote the Lord, is plain, for this is clearly stated. [5] In 
Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The voice of thy watchmen; they shall lift up the voice when they shall see eye to eye that Jehovah will return to Zion (Isa. 52:8); </p>
<p>"the watchmen" denote those who search the Scriptures 
concerning the coming of the Lord, their "voice" denotes the Word, which is the Divine truth that is the source. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The Maker of the earth by His understanding hath stretched out the 
heavens. At the voice which He uttereth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens (Jer. 5:12, 13; 51:6). "The voice" here denotes Divine truth; "waters" denote truths which are in the heavens and 
from the heavens. (That "waters" in the Word denote truths, see n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 9323.) [6] So also in the following passages: </p>
<p>     The voice of the Son of man was like the sound of 
many waters (Rev.1:15).      I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters (Rev. 14:2).      The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, Jehovah is upon great waters (Ps. 29:3). Jehovah hath 
uttered His voice before His army, for without number is he that doeth His word (Joel 2:11). In this passage also "voice" denotes Divine truth, and likewise the Word which they do. Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
shall utter His voice from Jerusalem, so that the heavens and the earth shall shake (Joel 3:16).      Sing psalms unto the Lord, ye kingdoms of the earth, to Him that rideth upon the heaven of 
heaven of old; lo, He shall utter in a voice a voice of strength (Ps. 68:32, 33).      I say unto you, The hour cometh when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall 
live (John 5:25). That "the voice" in this passage denotes Divine truth, consequently the Word of the Lord, is manifest. [7] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice 
of a great earthquake, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah. And I heard the voice of the wings of the living creatures, and the voice of the wheels, even the voice of a great earthquake (Ezek. 3:12-13).  
    The voice of the wings of the cherubs was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Shaddai when He speaketh (Ezek. 10:5). Here also "the voice" denotes Divine truth; for "the 
cherubs" signify the providence and guard of the Lord that there be no approach to Himself and to heaven except through the good of love (n. 9277, 9509); "the voice of the wings," and "the voice of the 
wheels," denote spiritual truths.  [8] In the present verse, in which Aaron is treated of, it is the sound or ringing from the bells which is called a "voice." In other passages of the Word also sounds 
and blarings from trumpets, and sounds and peals from thunders, are called "voices;" and thereby in like manner are signified Divine truths (see n. 7573). Moreover, the sounds of musical instruments 
of various kinds have also a like signification; but those which give out a stridulous and a discrete sound signify Divine spiritual truths; while those which give out a continuous sound signify 
Divine celestial truths (n. 418-420, 4138, 8337). From this it is evident that by the sounds or "voices" of the bells are signified Divine spiritual truths; for the garments of Aaron, and specifically 
the robe, in the skirts of which were the bells, round about, represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom or heaven (n. 9814, 9825). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9926</b></p><p><b>9926.</b>
'And his voice will be heard' means the inflow of truth among those in heaven and those on earth. This is clear from the meaning of 'being heard' as reception and perception, dealt with in <a href="5017.htm">5017</a>, <a href="5471.htm">5471</a>, <a href="5475.htm">5475</a>, <a href="7216.htm">7216</a>, <a href="8361.htm">8361</a>, <a href="9311.htm">9311</a>, and therefore also an inflowing, since things that are received and perceived must flow in; and from the meaning of 'voice' - when Aaron, who represents the Lord, is the subject 
- as Divine Truth, dealt with in <a href="8813.htm">8813</a>. For 'voice' means the declaration of that truth; and because the declaration is meant, truth among those in heaven and those on earth is meant. Divine Truth 
fills all things of heaven, and composes all things of the Church. Such declaration was represented by the 'voice' or sound made by the bells of gold when Aaron 'went into the holy place before Jehovah, 
and when he came out', as stated by the words that immediately follow in the present verse.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'voice' in the Word means Divine Truth that is heard and perceived in heaven and on 
earth is clear from the following places: In David,  </p>
<p>The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters; the voice of Jehovah is powerful; the voice of Jehovah is majestic; the voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars; 
the voice of Jehovah strikes as a flame of fire; the voice of Jehovah causes the wilderness to shake; the voice of Jehovah causes the hinds to calve. But in His temple everyone says, Glory! Ps. 
29:3-9.  </p>
<p>The subject in this Psalm is the Divine Truth which destroys falsities and evils. This Divine Truth is meant by 'the voice of Jehovah', but by 'Glory' that is uttered is meant Divine Truth 
present in heaven and in the Church. For the meaning of 'glory' as Divine Truth, see <a href="9429.htm">9429</a>; and for that of 'temple' as heaven and the Church, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In John,  </p>
<p>He who is the Shepherd of the 
sheep, to him the gate-keeper opens, and the sheep hear His voice. The sheep follow Him, because they know His voice. A stranger they do not follow, because they do not know the voice of strangers. And 
other sheep I have which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice. But you are not of My sheep, for My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. John 
10:2-5, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>, <a href="27.htm">27</a>.  </p>
<p>Here it is plainly evident that 'voice' means Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, which is the Word, 'the voice of strangers' being falsity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The voice 
of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of Jehovah. For the glory of Jehovah will be revealed. The voice says, Cry! Get up on to the high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings; lift up your 
voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings. Lift it up; [say,] Behold, the Lord Jehovih comes with might. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:3,%205,%206,%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:3, 5, 6, 9, 10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The voice' here means the declaration 
from the Word, telling about the Lord's Coming, and therefore also means Divine Truth, which the Word tells. 'The wilderness' is the state of the Church then, which is so to speak in the wilderness because 
the Word is no longer understood. 'The glory' which will be revealed is the Word on its more internal levels, for which meaning of 'glory' see <a href="9429.htm">9429</a>. 'Jehovah' for whom the way should be prepared, 
and 'the Lord Jehovih' who is to come in might, is plainly the Lord, for this is what it clearly says.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of your watchmen, they will lift up [their] voice, when they 
see eye to eye that Jehovah returns to Zion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Watchmen' stands for those who search the Scriptures regarding the Lord's Coming. Their 'voice' is the Word, which is Divine Truth, their source. 
In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who makes the earth, by His intelligence He spreads out the heavens; when He utters His voice,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> there is a multitude of waters in the heavens. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:12,%2013;%2051:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:12, 13; 51:15, 16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Voice' 
stands for Divine Truth, 'waters' for truths which are in the heavens and come from the heavens (for the meaning of 'waters' in the Word as truths, see <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="8568.htm">8568</a>, <a href="9323.htm">9323</a>), 
as also in the Book of Revelation,  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 ... the voice of the Son of Man as the sound of many waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:15</a>. I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:2</a>.  </p>
<p>And in 
David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, Jehovah is upon great waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2029:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 29:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Joel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah uttered His voice before His army; for those who execute His Word are uncountable. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'voice' stands for Divine Truth, as does 'the Word' which they execute. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah from Jerusalem will give forth His voice, that the heavens and the earth 
may be shaken. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<p>O kingdoms of the earth, make melody to the Lord who rides above the heaven of the heaven of old. Behold, He will utter His voice, a mighty voice.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Ps. 
68:32, <a href="33.htm">33</a>.  </p>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I say to you, that the hour will come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:25</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here, it is evident, 'the voice' means 
Divine Truth and therefore the Word of the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of a great earthquake, Blessed is the glory of Jehovah. And [I 
heard] the voice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of the wings of the living creatures, and the voice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of the wheels, and the voice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of the great earthquake. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%203:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 3:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The voice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of the wings of

<p>Here also 'the voice' is Divine Truth, for by 'the cherubs' is meant the Lord's providence 
and watchfulness, guarding against access to Himself, or into heaven, except through the good of love, <a href="9277.htm">9277</a> (end), <a href="9509.htm">9509</a>. 'The voice of the wings' and 'the voice of the wheels' are spiritual truths.

 In the present verse, in which Aaron is the subject, the sound or ring from the bells is what 'the voice' refers to. There are also places in the Word in which the sounds or blasts from trumpets, 
or else the sounds or peals of thunder, are called 'voices', and by these in like manner Divine Truths are meant, see <a href="7573.htm">7573</a>. Furthermore the sounds made by different types of musical instruments have 
a similar meaning, though those producing separate vibrating notes mean Divine Truths that are spiritual, whereas those producing notes continuing one into the next mean Divine Truths that are celestial,

had the bells on its hem round about, represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom or heaven, <a href="9814.htm">9814</a>, <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>.

`Et audietur vox ejus': quod significet influxum veri apud illos qui in caelis et qui in terris, constat ex significatione `audiri' quod sit receptio et perceptio, de qua n. 5017, 5471, 5475, 7216, 
8361, 9311, inde quoque influxus, nam quae recipiuntur et percipiuntur influent; et ex significatione `vocis' cum de Aharone, per quem repraesentatur Dominus, quod sit Divinum Verum, de qua n. 8813; vox 
enim est annuntiatum ejus, et quia est annuntiatum, est apud illos qui in caelis et in terris; nam Divinum Verum implet omnia caeli, et facit omnia Ecclesiae; tale annuntiatum repraesentabatur per 
vocem ex tintinnabulis auri cum Aharon intrabat ad sanctum coram Jehovah, et cum exibat, ut dicitur in {1}nunc sequentibus in hoc versu. 	Quod `vox' in Verbo significet Divinum Verum, quod auditur et 
2 percipitur in caelis et in terris, constat a sequentibus his locis: apud Davidem, 	Vox Jehovae super aquis; vox Jehovae in virtute; vox Jehovae cum honore; vox Jehovae frangit cedros; vox Jehovae 
incidens ut flamma ignis; vox Jehovae trepidare facit desertum; vox Jehovae parturire facit cervas; sed in templo Ipsius quivis dicit gloriam, Ps. xxix 3-9; </p>
<p>agitur in illo Psalmo de Divino Vero, quod 
destruit falsa et mala; Divinum illud Verum est `vox Jehovae'; gloria autem quae dicitur, est Divinum Verum in caelo et in Ecclesia; quod `gloria' sit Divinum Verum, videatur n. 9429, et quod `templum' 
sit caelum et Ecclesia, 3 n. 3720: apud Johannem, 	Qui Pastor ovium est, huic ostiarius aperit, et oves vocem illius audiunt: oves Ipsum sequuntur, quia sciunt vocem Ipsius: alienum non sequuntur, 
quia non sciunt alienorum vocem. Et alias oves habeo quae non sunt ex ovili hoc, etiam illas oportet Me adducere, et vocem Meam audient: sed vos non estis ex ovibus Meis, nam oves Meae vocem Meam audiunt, 
et Ego cognosco (x)illas, et sequuntur Me, x 2-5, 16, 26, 27; </p>
<p>quod hic `vox' sit Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, ita Verbum, 4 manifeste patet; `alienorum vox' est falsum: apud Esaiam, 	Vox 
clamantis in deserto, Parate viam Jehovae, revelabitur enim gloria Jehovae: vox dicit, Clama; super montem altum ascende, evangelizatrix Zion, extolle cum virtute vocem tuam, evangelizatrix Hierosolyma; 
extolle, Ecce Dominus Jehovih in forti venit, xl 3, 5, 6, 9, 10; Joh. i 23; </p>
<p>`vox' ibi est annuntiatum ex Verbo de Adventu Domini, ita quoque est Divinum Verum, quod Verbum annuntiat; `desertum' est 
status Ecclesiae tunc, quae sicut in deserto, (m)quia Verbum non amplius intellectum; `gloria quae revelabitur' est {2} Verbum quoad interiora ejus; quod id sit `gloria,' videatur n. 9429; quod Jehovah, 
Cui via {3}pararetur, et {4} Dominus Jehovih, Qui in forti venturus, sit Dominus, patet, {5}nam 5 clare dicitur:(n) {6} apud Esaiam, 	Vox speculatorum tuorum, tollent vocem, cum oculo ad oculum 
viderint, quod {7}revertatur Jehovah Zionem, lii 8; </p>
<p>`speculatores' pro illis qui scrutantur scripturas de Adventu Domini; `vox' illorum est Verbum, quod est Divinum Verum ex quo: apud Jeremiam, 	Factor 
terrae, per intelligentiam Suam extendit caelos, ad vocem quam dat Ille, multitudo aquarum in caelis, x 12, 13, li [15,] 16; </p>
<p>`vox' pro Divino Vero, {8}'aquae' pro veris quae in caelis et ex caelis; 
quod `aquae' in Verbo sint vera, videatur n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 8568, 9323, ut quoque in Apocalypsi, 	6 Vox Filii hominis sicut sonitus aquarum multarum, i 15: </p>
<p>Audivi vocem e caelo tanquam 
vocem aquarum multarum, xiv 2: et apud Davidem, 	Vox Jehovae super aquis, Jehovah super aquis magnis, P. xxix 3: </p>
<p>apud Joelem, 	Jehovah edidit vocem Suam coram exercitu Suo, quia innumerus qui 
facit Verbum Ipsius, ii 11; </p>
<p>`vox' etiam ibi pro Divino Vero, etiam Verbum quod faciunt: apud eundem, 	Jehovah ex Hierosolyma dabit vocem Suam, ut contremiscant caeli et terra, iv (x)16 [A.V. iii 16]: </p>
<p>apud 
Davidem, 	Regna terrae, psallite Domino, equitanti super caelo caeli antiquitatis, ecce dabit in voce vocem roboris, Ps. lxviii 33, 34 [A.V. 32, 33]: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Dico vobis quod veniet 
hora quando mortui audient vocem Filii {9}Dei, et qui audient vivent, v 25; </p>
<p>quod `vox' ibi sit Divinum Verum, proinde Verbum Domini, patet: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	7 Sustulit me Spiritus, et audivi post 
me vocem terrae motus magni, Benedicta gloria Jehovae, et vocem alarum animalium, et vocem rotarum, et vocem terrae motus magni, iii 12, 13: </p>
<p>et dein, 	Vox alarum cheruborum audita est usque ad atrium 
exterius, sicut vox Dei Schaddai cum loquitur, x 5; </p>
<p>`vox' etiam ibi est Divinum Verum, `cherubi' enim significant providentiam et custodiam Domini ne accessus sit ad Ipsum, et in caelum, nisi per bonum 
quod amoris, n. 9277 fin., 9509; `vox alarum et vox rotarum' sunt vera spiritualia. 	8 In hoc versu, {10}in quo de Aharone agitur, est sonus seu clangor (x)ex tintinnabulis, qui dicitur vox; etiam 
alibi in Verbo sunt soni et clangores ex {11} buccinis, ut et sonitus et clangores ex tonitribus, qui dicuntur voces, et per (x)illos pariter significantur Divina Vera, videatur n. 7573; praeterea 
etiam soni instrumentorum musicorum varii generis (t)significant similia, sed quae {12}sonum edunt stridulum et discretum, {13}significant Divina Vera spiritualia, quae autem sonum edunt continuum, Divina 
Vera caelestia, n. 418-420, 4138, 8337; inde patet quod per `sonos' seu `voces tintinnabulorum' significentur Divina Vera spiritualia; nam vestes Aharonis, et in specie pallium, in cujus fimbriis 
circumcirca erant, repraesentabant regnum seu caelum spirituale Domini, n. 9814, 9825. @1 d nunc i mox$ @2 i Divinum Verum seu$ @3 parabitur$ @4 i quoque$ @5 quia$ @6 i similiter alibi$ @7 revertetur
