<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>459.</strong>存在三层天堂，第一层天堂是善灵所在之地，第二层是天使灵所在之地，第三层是天使所在之地。善灵、天使灵、天使皆被分为属天和属灵两类。属天者是那些通过爱从主接受信的人，如前面所说的上古教会成员。属灵者是那些通过信的认知从主接受仁，并出于所接受的仁而行的人。本章末尾将继续阐述该主题。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]459.</strong> There are three heavens. The first is where good spirits are, the second where angelic spirits are, and the third where actual angels are.<br />Spirits, angelic spirits, and angels are each as a group divided up into heavenly and spiritual types. The heavenly ones are those whom love has led to receive faith from the Lord, as those who were part of the earliest church did; they have already been described [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32#subsection-2-2" target=_top>32:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34" target=_top>34</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202" target=_top>202</a>]. The spiritual ones are those whom religious knowledge has led to receive a feeling of charity from the Lord and then to act on it.<br />More on this subject follows at the end of the chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_537" target=_top>537-546</a>]. </p>

There are three heavens: the first is the abode of good spirits; the second, of angelic spirits and the third, of angels. Spirits, angelic spirits, and angels are all distinguished into the celestial 
and the spiritual. The celestial are those who through love have received faith from the Lord, like the men of the Most Ancient Church treated of above. The spiritual are those who through knowledges 
of faith have received charity from the Lord, and who act from what they have received.      A continuation of this subject will follow at the end of this chapter. </p>

the book of the births of Man. In the day that God created Man, in the likeness of God made He him.       2. Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Man, in the day 
when they were created.       3. And Man lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat into his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.       4. And the days of Man after he begat Seth were

all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.      28. And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son; </p>
<p>     29. And he called his name Noah, saying, 
He shall comfort us from our work, and the toil of our hands, out of the ground which JEHOVAH hath cursed.      30. And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat

There are three heavens. The first is where good spirits are, the second where angelic spirits are, and the third where angels are. All three groups - spirits, angelic spirits, and angels - divide into 
celestial and spiritual. The celestial are those who have by means of love received faith from the Lord, as did members of the Most Ancient Church, dealt with already. The spiritual are those who have 
by means of cognitions of faith received charity from the Lord, and who act from the charity they have received. This subject is continued at the end of the chapter.    <h3>GENESIS 5</h3>
