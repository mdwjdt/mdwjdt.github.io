<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6559节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6559.</strong>“照着我们从前待他一切的恶，足足地报复我们”表应受的惩罚因此即将来临。这从“照着我们从前待他一切的恶，足足地报复”的含义清楚可知，“照着我们从前待他一切的恶，足足地报复”是指应受的惩罚；因为向某人所行之恶的返回就是那应受的惩罚。有必要阐述一下何为恶的返回，或在灵界，惩罚是何性质，因为这会表明此处这些话的内义。在灵人界，如果恶灵所行之恶超出了他们通过在世的生活所吸收的邪恶，实施惩罚者立刻到来，并完全照着他们越界的程度严惩他们。因为来世的法则是，人不可变得比在世时更坏。那些受到惩罚的恶灵根本不知道实施这些惩罚的人是如何知道他们所行之恶超出了他们在世所吸收的。但他们被告知，在来世，秩序具有这样的性质：邪恶自带惩罚，以至于所犯的邪恶与作为惩罚所受的邪恶完全绑在一起，也就是说，对邪恶的惩罚就在邪恶本身里面。因此，回以惩罚的人立刻到来是符合秩序的。<br />在灵人界，这就是当恶灵行恶时所发生的情形。但在他们自己的地狱，他们会照着他们通过自己在世的行为所吸收的邪恶而彼此惩罚；因为这邪恶是他们自己带入来世的。由此可见当如何理解“照着我们从前待他一切的恶，足足地报复我们”所表示的这句话，即：应受的惩罚因此即将来临。至于善灵，他们若偶然说了坏话，或行了恶，不会受到惩罚，却得赦免，也不受责备；因为他们不是有意说坏话，或行恶。他们知道这类坏话、恶行是由地狱在他们里面所激起的，因此不是他们自己的过错。这一事实也能从他们抵制邪恶的行为和随后的悲伤看出来。</p>

And returning will return unto us all the evil that we requited to him. That this signifies the penalty therefore impending according to the desert, is evident from the signification of "returning the 
evil that we requited to him," as being the penalty according to the desert; for returning the evil which is done anyone, is penalty from having deserved it. How the case is with returning evil, or 
with penalties, in the spiritual world, must be told, because from this the internal sense of these words is plain. If evil spirits do any evil in the world of spirits beyond what they have imbued themselves 
with by their life in the world, punishers are instantly at hand and chastise them in exact accordance with the degree in which they pass these limits; for it is a law in the other life that no 
one must become worse than he had been in this world. They who are being punished cannot tell how these chastisers know that the evil is beyond what they had imbued themselves with; but they are informed 
that there is such an order in the other life that the very evil is attended with its penalty, so that the evil of the deed is wholly conjoined with the evil of the penalty, that is to say, its 
penalty is in the evil itself; and therefore that it is according to order for the requiters to be instantly at hand. [2] This is what happens when evil spirits do evil in the world of spirits; but in 
their own hell they chastise one another according to the evil which they had by act imbued themselves with in this world; for this evil they bring with them into the other life. From all this it is 
evident how it is to be understood that the penalty impends according to the desert, which is signified by the words, "returning he will return unto us all the evil that we requited to him." But as regards 
good spirits, if perchance they speak or do evil, they are not punished, but pardoned, and also excused; for their end is not to speak or do evil, and they know that such things are excited in 
them by hell, so that they have not come to pass by their fault; and the same is also observed from their resistance, and afterward from their grief. </p>

'And will fully return to us all the evil with which we repaid him' means that a punishment as merited is therefore impending. This is clear from the meaning of 'returning the evil with which they repaid 
him' as a punishment as merited; for the return of evil that is done to someone is the punishment that is duly merited. What the returning of evil is, or what the nature of punishments in the spiritual 
world is, must be stated because it will show what the internal sense is of the words under consideration here. If in the world of spirits evil spirits do anything evil that exceeds the evil they 
assimilated by the life they led in the world, those who administer punishment become present in an instant and chastise those spirits in exact accord with the degree of their transgression. For the 
rule in the next life is that no one should become more evil than he had been in the world. Those who suffer punishment have no knowledge at all of how the ones who administer such punishment know that 
the evil they do exceeds what they assimilated in the world. But they are told that the nature of order in the next life is such that evil itself carries its own punishment, so that the evil that 
is committed is completely bound up with the evil inflicted as punishment, that is, within the evil itself lies its own punishment. It is therefore in keeping with order that those who repay with punishment 
should be instantly present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is what happens when evil spirits in the world of spirits perform evil. But in their own hell one spirit chastises another in accord with the evil they 
assimilated by their actions in the world; for they take that evil with them into the next life. From all this it may now be seen how one is to understand the statement that a punishment as merited is 
therefore impending, meant by 'will fully return to us all the evil with which we repaid him'. </p>
<p>But as for good spirits, if by chance they utter what is evil or do what is evil, they are not punished 
but are pardoned and also freed from blame; for it is not their intention to utter what is evil or to do what is evil. And they know that such evil words and deeds were aroused in them by hell and 
for that reason were not their own fault. This fact can also be recognized from their action against that evil and subsequent grief. </p>

`Et reducendo reducet nobis omne malum quod retribuimus illi': quod significet quod poena ideo immineat secundum meritum, constat ex significatione `reducere malum quod retribuimus illi' quod sit poena 
secundum meritum, nam reductio mali quod fit alicui, est poena ex merito.  Quomodo se habet cum reductione mali, seu {1}poenis ii, mundo spirituali, dicendum quia inde patet quis sensus internus horum 
verborum {2}est: si mali spiritus aliquod malum faciunt in mundo spirituum supra quod imbuerunt ex vita in mundo, adsunt ilico punitores et illos castigant prorsus secundum gradum quem transcendunt; 
nam lex in altera vita est quod nullus pejor fieri debeat quam in mundo fuerat; qui puniuntur, prorsus nesciunt unde castigatores illi sciunt quod malum sit supra quod imbuerunt, sed informantur quod 
talis ordo in altera vita sit quod ipsum malum secum poenam habeat, sic ut malum facti prorsus conjunctum sit cum malo poenae, hoc est, ut in ipso malo sit poena ejus; ac ideo quod secundum ordinem 
sit quod retributores ilico adsint; [2] ita fit cum spiritus mali in mundo spirituum malum faciunt, at in inferno suo castigat unus alterum secundum malum {3}quod actualiter imbuerant in mundo, nam 
id malum secum ferunt in alteram vitam; ex his constare potest quomodo intelligendum quod poena ideo immineat secundum meritum, quod significatur per quod `reducendo reducet nobis omne malum quod retribuimus 
illi'.  Quod autem attinet bonos spiritus, illi si forte male loquuntur aut {4}malum faciunt, non puniuntur, sed condonantur et quoque excusantur, nam finis eorum non est male loqui aut malum 
facere, (c)ac sciunt quod talia sint excitata apud illos ab inferno, {5}sic quod non prodierint ex sua culpa; hoc etiam appercipitur a renisu illorum, et postea a dolore. @1 poena$ @2 sit$ @3 vitae
