<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2252节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2252.</strong>“假若那城当中有五十个义人”表真理有可能充满良善。这从“五十”、“义人”、“当中”和“城”的含义清楚可知，“五十”是指充满，“义人”是指良善（参看<a href="612.htm">612</a>，<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节），“当中”是指内在之物（<a href="1074.htm">1074</a>节），“城”是指真理（<a href="402.htm">402</a>节）。因此，“那城当中有五十个义人”就内义而言，表示真理内在有可能充满良善。从字面上无法看出这些话具有这样的含义，因为字义上的历史会将心智引向完全不同的方向，或使心智以不同的方式思考。然而，我十分肯定，通晓内义的人就是照着这种含义来理解这些话的。而且，他们绝不会将数字本身，如此处的“五十”和下面的“四十五”、“四十”、“三十”、“二十”、“十”等，理解为数字，而是理解为真实事物或状态，如前所述（<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>-<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="1963.htm">1963</a>，<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>节）。<br />古人用数字来估算其教会的各个状态，他们估算数字的性质可从刚才这些地方所提到的数字的含义明显看出来。他们通过存在于灵人界的代表而掌握数字的含义，在灵人界，凡表现为数字的事物都不是指以数字来确定的某种事物，而是指这个事物或状态本身，这从前面相关内容，以及“十二”表示信的一切事物的引证（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>节）明显看出来。现在接下来的数字也一样。这表明就内义而言，圣言具有何种性质。<br />“五十”表完满，原因在于，这个数字是七乘以七，或四十九之后的数字，因此它是四十九这个数字的完满。这解释了为何代表性教会在第五十日举办七个安息日节，在第五十年庆祝禧年。关于七个安息日节，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />你们要从安息日的次日，献禾捆为摇祭的那日算起，要满了七个安息日。到第七个安息日的次日，共计五十天，又要将新素祭献给耶和华。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.15.htm">23:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.16.htm">16</a>）<br />关于禧年：<br />你要计算七个安息年，就是七七年。它们便为你成了七个安息年，共是四十九年。你们要以第五十年为圣年，在全地向所有的居民宣告自由。这是你们的禧年。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.8.htm">25:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这表明第五十是与安息日相关的完满。<br />而且，凡圣言中提及“五十”的地方，它都表示完满，如利未人从三十岁直到五十岁全都被数点（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.23.htm">4:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.43.htm">43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.47.htm">47</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.25.htm">8:25</a>）。此处“五十”表任职办事时期的完满或最后状态。<br />和她同寝的那人就要拿五十舍客勒银子给女子的父亲，因他玷污了这女子，那少女便要归那人为妻，他也不可休她。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.29.htm">22:29</a>）<br />此处“五十舍客勒银子”表全额罚款和全额赔偿。<br />大卫给了亚劳拿五十舍客勒银子买了那禾场，用来给耶和华建坛。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.24.htm">24:24</a>）<br />这表示全价和全额付款。同样还有：<br />押沙龙为自己预备车马，又派五十人在他前头奔走。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下15.1.htm">15:1</a>）<br /><br />亚多尼雅预备车辆、马兵，又派五十人在他前头奔走。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上1.5.htm">1:5</a>）<br />这表示全部的尊贵和威严。因为这些人从古人那里接受某些具有代表性和属灵含义的数字，这些数字是他们所遵守的，并且也是他们的仪式所规定的。不过，他们绝大多数并不知道这些数字表示什么。<br />同样，由于“五十”表完满，这个数字也是代表，如前所述，故在主所说管家的寓言中，“五十”表同样的事物，管家对那欠油的说：<br />你欠我主人多少？他说，一百篓（每篓约五十斤）油。管家对他说，拿你的账，快坐下，写五十。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.6.htm">16:6</a>）<br />“五十”表债务的全部清偿。由于五十是一个数字，故表面上看，它似乎只暗示数字。然而，就内义而言，它处处表示完满。如哈该书：<br />有人来到酒池，想从中得五十桶，只得了二十桶。（哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.16.htm">2:16</a>）<br />这表示想要完满，却不那么完满。“五十”若非具有这种含义，就不会在先知书中被提及。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2252</b></p><p><b>2252.</b>
Peradventure there be fifty righteous in the midst of the city. That this signifies that the truths may possibly be full of goods, is evident from the signification of "fifty," as being what is full; 
from the signification of "righteous" as being good (see n. 612, 2235); from that of the "midst," as being what is within (n. 1074); and from that of "city," as being truth (n. 402). Thus "fifty righteous 
in the midst of the city," means in the internal sense that truths may possibly be full of goods within. That there is this meaning in these words cannot be seen from the letter, for the historicals 
of the literal sense lead the mind in quite a different direction, that is, to different thoughts; and yet that these words are so perceived by those who are in the internal sense, I know of a certainty. 
The numbers themselves also, as here "fifty," and in what follows "forty-five," "forty," "thirty," "twenty," and "ten," are by no means perceived as numbers by those who are in the internal sense, 
but as real things or states (as is shown, n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 2075). [2] For the ancients marked the states of their church-in one way-by numbers; and the nature of their 
computation in so doing is evident from the signification of the numbers in the places just referred to. They had the signification of numbers from the representatives which exist in the world of spirits, 
where, when anything appears as numbered, it does not signify anything that is determined by the numbers, but the thing or state itself; as is evident from the things that have been adduced (n. 
2129, 2130, also n. 2089) concerning "twelve," as meaning all the things of faith. It is similar with the numbers which now follow. This shows what is the nature of the Word in the internal sense. [3] 
That "fifty" signifies what is full, comes from its following next after the product of seven into seven, or forty-nine, so that it is the impletion of this number, on which account there was in the 
Representative Church the festival of the Seven Sabbaths on the fiftieth day, and the Jubilee in the fiftieth year. As regards the festival of the seven sabbaths we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye shall count 
unto you from the morrow of the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering, seven entire sabbaths shall there be, even unto the morrow of the seventh sabbath shall ye count 
fifty days, and ye shall offer a new offering unto Jehovah (Lev. 23:15). And concerning the Jubilee: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt count for thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times, and they shall 
be to thee seven sabbaths of years, nine and forty years, and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty in the land to all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you (Lev. 
25:8, 10), which shows that the fiftieth is what is full in relation to sabbaths. [4] Moreover, wherever "fifty" is mentioned in the Word, it signifies what is full; as when it is said that: </p>
<p>     
The Levites were numbered from a son of thirty years and upward, even unto a son of fifty years (Num. 4:23, 35, 39, 43, 47; 8:25); </p>
<p>meaning the full or final state of discharging the ministry.      That 
a man lying with a damsel, a virgin, shall give unto the damsel's father fifty pieces of silver, and she should be to him for a wife, nor could he put her away (Deut. 22:29), which denotes a full 
fine and full restitution.      David's giving to Araunah for the threshing-floor where he built the altar to Jehovah, fifty shekels of silver (2 Sam. 24:24) denotes a full price and a full purchase.  
    Absalom's preparing for himself a chariot and horses, and having fifty men running before him (2 Sam. 15:1), and in like manner: </p>
<p>     Adonijah's having chariots and horsemen, and fifty men 
running before him (1 Kings 1:5), denotes full excellence and greatness. For they had from the ancients certain representative and significative numbers, which they observed, and which were also commanded 
in their rites; but most of them did not know what they signified. [5] And in the same way, as "fifty" signifies what is full, and as this number was also representative-already said-the same thing 
is signified by it in the Lord's parable of the steward, who said to him that owed the oil: </p>
<p>     How much owest thou unto my lord? And he said, a hundred baths of oil. And he said unto him, take 
thy bond, and sit down quickly, and write fifty (Luke 16:6); </p>
<p>"fifty" denoting full payment. As fifty is a number, it indeed appears to involve nothing beyond the number; whereas in the internal sense 
what is full is everywhere meant by it, as in Haggai: </p>
<p>     One came to the wine-press to draw out fifty out of the wine-press; there were twenty (Hag. 2:16), that is, instead of fullness there was 
not much. "Fifty" could not have been mentioned here in the Prophet unless it had been significative. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2252</b></p><p><b>2252.</b>
That 'perhaps there may be fifty righteous persons in the midst of the city' means that the truths may be full of goods is clear from the meaning of 'fifty' as full, from the meaning of 'righteous' as 
good, dealt with in <a href="612.htm">612</a>, <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>, from [the meaning] of 'midst' as that which is within, <a href="1074.htm">1074</a>, and from [the meaning] of 'the city' as truth, <a href="402.htm">402</a>. Thus 'fifty righteous persons in the midst of the city' 
in the internal sense means that the truths may be full of goods. That this meaning exists within these words cannot be seen by anyone from the letter, for the historical details of the literal sense 
lead the mind in an altogether different direction or to think in a different way; but that these words are nevertheless perceived according to that meaning by those who possess the internal sense, 
I know for certain. Moreover the actual numbers mentioned, such as fifty here, and forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, and ten in what follows, are never perceived as numbers by those who possess the internal 
sense but as real things or as states, as shown in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1963.htm">1963</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Indeed the ancients also used numbers to mark off one from another the states of 
their Church; and the nature of such numbers worked out by them becomes clear from the meaning of the numbers in the paragraphs that have just been mentioned. The meaning possessed by numbers was received 
by those people from the representatives which manifest themselves in the world of spirits. There when anything appears as that which is numbered, it does not mean something defined by means of numbers 
but means some real thing or else a state, as becomes clear from what has been presented in <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> and <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>, and also in <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, regarding 'twelve' meaning all things of faith. It is similar with the 
numbers that now follow. This shows what the nature of the Word is in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason 'fifty' means that which is full is that it is the number which comes after seven times seven, 
or forty-nine, and so marks the completion of the latter number. This explains why in the representative Church the feast of the seven sabbaths<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> was held on the fiftieth day, and why a jubilee was 
held in the fiftieth year. Regarding the feast of the seven sabbaths the following is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath; from the day you bring the sheaf 
of the wave-offering, seven sabbaths shall there be complete. Until the day after the seventh sabbath you shall count fifty days, and offer a new gift to Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:%2015,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23: 15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the 
jubilee in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall count for yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, and you shall have a time of seven sabbaths of years, forty-nine years. And you shall sanctify 
the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a jubilee for you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2025:%208,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 25: 8, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is evident that 'the fiftieth' means that which marks the full 
completion of the sabbaths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 What is more, whenever 'fifty' is mentioned in the Word it means that which is full, as in the case of the numbering of the Levites aged thirty years and over up 
to fifty years of age, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%204:%2023,%2035,%2039,%2043,%2047;%208:%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 4: 23, 35, 39, 43, 47; 8: 25</a>. Here 'fifty' stands for the full or final state of that period of ministerial service. A man found lying with a young woman who was a virgin 
had to give to the young woman's father fifty pieces of silver, and she had to be his wife; nor could he divorce her, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2022:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 22: 29</a>. Here 'fifty pieces of silver' stands for a full fine and a full recompense. 
David's giving to Araunah fifty pieces of silver for the threshing-floor, where he built an altar to Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2024:%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 24: 24</a>, stands for a full price and a full payment. Absalom's making ready 
for himself a chariot and horses, and his having fifty men running before him, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2015:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 15: 1</a>, and Adonijah's likewise having chariots and horsemen, and fifty men running before him, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 1: <a href="5.htm">5</a>, stand 
for their full dignity and majesty. For these people received from the ancients certain numbers which were representative and carried spiritual meanings and which were observed by them. Those numbers 
were also commanded in their religious observances, though the majority of the people did not know what was meant by them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same way, because 'fifty' means that which is full and this number 
was also representative, as has been stated, the same thing is meant in the Lord's parable concerning the steward, who said to the man owing oil, </p>
<p>How much do you owe my master? He said, A hundred 
baths of oil. Then he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty. Luke 16: <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="6.htm">6</a>. </p>
<p>'Fifty' stands for the full discharge of the debt. Being a number it does indeed seem to 
imply nothing more than a number, when in fact in the internal sense this number is used in every case to mean that which is full, as also in Haggai, </p>
<p>One came to the winevat to draw fifty measures 
from the winevat, and there were only twenty. Hagg. 2: <a href="16.htm">16</a>. </p>
<p>This means that instead of a full amount there was not much. 'Fifty' would not have been mentioned in the prophet if it had not carried this 
meaning.

Quod `forte sint quinquaginta justi in medio urbis significet quod vera possint esse plena bonis, constat ex signification' `quinquaginta' quod sit plenum, ex significatione `justi' quod si bonum, de

ab illis qui in sensu interno sunt, pro certo scio; ipsi etiam numeri, ut hic quinquaginta, et in sequentibus, quadraginta quinque, quadraginta, triginta viginti, et decem, ab illis qui in sensu interno 
sunt, nusquam percipiuntur ut numeri, sed ut res aut status, ut n. 482, (x)487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075 ostensum est.  [2] Antiqui enim Ecclesiae suae status etiam per numeros designabant, 
qui eorum computus qualis fuit, constare potest a significatione numerosum in locis citatis numerorum significationem habuerunt ex repraesentativis quae existunt in mundo spirituum, ubi cum 
aliquid apparet sicut numeratum non significat aliquod determinatum per numeros, sed rem, aut statum ut constare potest ex illis quae allata sunt n. 2129 et 2130, tum n. 2089: de duodecim {2}, quod 
sint omnia fidei; similiter se habet cum numeri: qui nunc sequuntur; inde patet quale est Verbum in sensu interno.  [3] Quod `quinquaginta' significent plenum, est inde quod sit numerus qui sequitur post 
septem in septem, seu quadraginta novem, sic ut is sit impletio eorum; quare in Ecclesia repraesentativa septem sabbatorum festum erat die quinquagesimo, et jubilaeum anno quinquagesimo; de septem 
sabbatorum festo ita apud Mosen, 	Numerabitis vobis a crastino sabbati, a die afferre vos manipulum motitationis, septem sabbata integra erunt, usque `ad a crastino' sabbati septimi numerabitis quinquaginta 
dies, et offeretis munus novam Jehovae, Lev. xxiii 15, 16. De jubilaeo apud eundem, 	Numerabis tibi septem sabbata annorum, septem annos septem vicibus, et erunt tibi dies septem sabbatorum 
annorum, novem et quadraginta anni,... et sanctificabitis annum quinquagesimum, et proclamabitis libertatem in terra omnibus habitatoribus ejus, jubilaeus ille erit vobis, Lev. xxv 8, 10; </p>
<p>[4] inde {4} 
patet quod `quinquagesimum' sit plenum sabbatorum: praeterea, ubicumque nominantur (t)quinquaginta in Verbo, significant plenum; ut quod 	Recensiti Levitae a filio triginta annorum et supra usque 
ad filium quinquaginta annorum, Num. iv 23, (x)35, 39, 43, 47; viii 25; </p>
<p>pro pleno seu ultimo statu obeundi tunc ministerii: quod 	Vir concumbens cum puella virgine, daret patri puellae quinquaginta

<p>pro plena mulcta, et plena restitutione: </p>
<p>	Quod David Arafnae pro area, ubi altare Jehovae exstruxit, dederit quinquaginta siclos 
argenti, 2 Sam. xxiv 	24; </p>
<p>pro pleno pretio, et pleno empto: </p>
<p>	Quod Absalom fecerit sibi currum et equos, et habuerit quinquaginta viros currentes ante illum, 2 Sam. xv 1; </p>
<p>similiter Adonijah currus 
et equites, et quinquaginta viros currentes ante illum, 1 Reg. i 5, pro plena excellentia et magnitudine.  Ab antiquis enim habuerunt certos numeros repraesentativos et significativos quos observabant, 
qui etiam in ritibus eorum mandati sunt, sed plerique nesciebant quid significarent; [5] et sic quia `quinquaginta' significant plenum, et is numerus etiam repraesentativus fuit, ut dictum, significatur 
per illum idem in parabola Domini de oeconomo qui dixit ad debitorem olei, 	Quantum debes domino meo? hic dixit, Centum batos olei; tum dixit ei, Sume syngrapham tuam, et sedens ocius scribe

<p>`quinquaginta' pro plena solutione; quia est numerus, quidem apparet quod nihil praeter numerum involvat, cum tamen in sensu interno ubivis per illum numerum, plenum sit
