<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3803节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3803.</strong>“雅各告诉拉结，自己是她父亲的兄弟”表“雅各”所代表的良善与“拉班”所代表的良善的亲属关系。这从“告诉”、“兄弟”和“父亲”的含义，以及“雅各”和“拉结”的代表清楚可知：“告诉”是指让人知道；“雅各”是指良善，如前所述；让人知道它的“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感（<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>节）；“兄弟”，就是此处的雅各，是指良善（<a href="367.htm">367</a>，<a href="2360.htm">2360</a>，<a href="3303.htm">3303</a>，<a href="3459.htm">3459</a>节）；“父亲”，就是此处的拉班，也是指良善（<a href="3703.htm">3703</a>节）。从所有这些含义，以及整个思路明显可知，“雅各告诉拉结，自己是她父亲的兄弟”表示“雅各”所表的良善与“拉班”所表的良善的亲属关系。不过，解释这种亲属关系本身，以及随之这二者通过拉结所表示的内层真理情感的结合，会使这个问题变得更模糊，因为很少有人知道何为属世层的良善，该良善与理性层的良善截然不同，相互分离。他们不知道何为源自一个共同家族的旁系良善，也不知道何为对内层真理的情感。人若没有通过自己的调查为自己获得对这些事的某种概念，那么即便有，也只能通过对它们的描述获得一种肤浅的观念；因为对于别人所给予的描述，人只接受与他自己的观念，或他通过在自己里面所看到的事物而为自己所获得的观念相一致的，其余的则被他忽略过去了。人知道良善与真理的无数亲属关系是存在的，并且天上的社群是照着这些亲属关系而存在（参看<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>，<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>，<a href="3612.htm">3612</a>节）就足够了。<br />雅各明明是拉班的外甥，却自称为拉班的“兄弟”，这是因为所有人凭良善而成为兄弟。由于同样的原因，拉班反过来也称“雅各”为弟兄 （29:15）。构成血亲关系和实现结合的，正是良善，因为良善是爱的一种属性，爱是属灵的结合。这也是为何在古教会，所有那些处于良善的人都互称兄弟的原因。甚至犹太教会也是这样，不过，由于该教会鄙视其他所有人，以为唯独他们自己蒙拣选，所以他们只称呼身为犹太人的人为兄弟，将其他人称为同伴或外人。初代基督教会也视所有处于良善的人为兄弟，但后来这个称谓只局限于那些在他们自己会众当中的人。于是，“兄弟”这个名，连同良善就从基督徒当中消失了。当真理取代良善，或信取代仁时，他们就无法再凭良善称呼彼此为兄弟，只称为邻舍。这也是缺乏仁爱生活的信之教义的结果，因为与地位低于自己的人结为兄弟关系似乎在他们之下。对这种人来说，兄弟关系并非来源于主，因而来源于良善，而是来源于他们自己，因而来源于地位和利益。<br />3803a.“是利百加的儿子”表良善的这些具有亲属关系的种类之间的联结。这是显而易见的，无需解释，因为利百加，即雅各的母亲，拉班的妹子，就是这种结合存在于其中的那一位。</p>

And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother. That this signifies the affinity of the good which is "Jacob" and of the good which is "Laban," is evident from the signification of "telling," 
as being to make known; and from the representation of Jacob, as being good (concerning which see above); and from the representation of Rachel to whom this was made known, as being the affection of 
interior truth (n. 3793); and from the signification of "brother," who here is Jacob, as being good (n. 367, 2360, 3303, 3459); and from the signification of "father," who here is Laban, as also being 
good (n. 3703). From all this and also from the series it is evident that by "Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother," is signified the affinity of the good which is "Jacob" and of the good 
which is "Laban." But to set forth this affinity itself, and the consequent conjunction of the two through the affection of interior truth (which is "Rachel") would be to make the subject more obscure, 
because few know what the good of the natural is, and that this is distinct from the, good of the rational; or what is the collateral good of a common stock; or again what is the affection of interior 
truth. He who by his own investigation has not acquired for himself some idea concerning these things, receives but a faint idea, if any, from description; for a man receives only so much from others 
as he either has of his own, or acquires for himself by looking into the matter in himself; all the rest passes away. Suffice it to know that there are innumerable affinities of good and truth, 
and that the heavenly societies are in accordance therewith (see n. 685, 917, 2739, 3612).  [2] The reason why Jacob calls himself the "brother" of Laban, when yet he was his sister's son, is that all 
are brethren from good; and for the same reason Laban in his turn calls Jacob "brother" (verse 15). It is good which makes blood relationship, and which conjoins; for good is of love, and love is spiritual 
conjunction. This is the reason why in the ancient churches all those who were in good were called brethren, and even in the Jewish Church but inasmuch as this church esteemed all others vile, 
and supposed themselves alone to be the chosen, they called only those brethren who were born Jews, and all others they called either companions or strangers. The primitive Christian Church also called 
all brethren who were in good, but afterwards only those who were within their own congregation. But the name "brother" vanished away from among Christians, together with good, and when truth succeeded 
in the place of good, or faith in the place of charity, then they could no longer from good call one another brethren, but neighbors. This also is the effect of the doctrine of faith without the 
life of charity, in that brotherhood with one of lower station than themselves seems to be beneath them; for with such persons brotherhood does not derive its origin from the Lord, and consequently from 
good; but from self, and consequently from honor and gain. </p>
<p>3803a. And that he was Rebekah's son. That this signifies the conjunction of these affinities, is evident without explication; for Rebekah, 
who was the mother of Jacob and the sister of Laban, was she from whom was the conjunction. </p>

'Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother' means the kinship of the good represented by 'Jacob' and of the good represented by 'Laban'. This is clear from the meaning of 'telling' as making 
known; from the representation of 'Jacob' as good, dealt with already; from the representation of 'Rachel', to whom it was made known, as the affection for interior truth, dealt with in <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>; from the 
meaning of 'brother', who in this place is Jacob, as good, dealt with in <a href="367.htm">367</a>, <a href="2360.htm">2360</a>, <a href="3303.htm">3303</a>, <a href="3459.htm">3459</a>; and from the meaning of 'father', who in this place is Laban, as good also, dealt with in <a href="3703.htm">3703</a>. From these 
meanings and from the train of thought it is evident that 'Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother' means the kinship of the good meant by 'Jacob' and of the good meant by 'Laban'. To 
explain the actual kinship however and so the joining together of the two through the affection for interior truth meant by 'Rachel' would only throw the matter into obscurity, for few know what the good 
of the natural is and that this is distinct and separate from the good of the rational. Neither do they know what a parallel good springing from a common stock is, nor also what the affection for 
interior truth is. Anyone who has not by finding out for himself gathered some idea of these matters gains merely a superficial idea, if any at all, from a description of them; for a person takes in only 
as much of a description given by others as fits in with ideas of his own or else which he acquires by coming to see the thing in himself. All else passes him by. It is enough if one knows that countless 
kinships of good and truth exist, and that heavenly communities exist in accordance with those kinships, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="2739.htm">2739</a>, <a href="3612.htm">3612</a>. </p>

 The reason why Jacob calls himself Laban's brother when he 
was in fact his sister's son is that by virtue of good all are brothers. This also is why Laban in turn calls Jacob 'brother' in verse 15. For it is good that constitutes blood-relationship and which 
effects any joining together, since good is an attribute of love, and love is a spiritual joining together. This also was the reason why in the ancient Churches all who were governed by good were called 
brothers. The same happened in the Jewish Church, but because that Church despised everybody else and imagined that they alone were the elect it spoke only of those who had been born Jews as brothers. 
The rest it called companions or foreigners. The primitive Christian Church also referred to as brothers all who were governed by good, but later on it confined the term to those inside its own group. 
But the name brother disappeared from among Christians when good did so. And when truth took the place of good, or faith the place of charity, none was able any longer to call another brother by 
virtue of good, only neighbour. This is also a feature of the doctrine of faith when devoid of the life of charity, in that it seems to be beneath them to exist as a brotherhood when this includes any 
of lower rank than themselves. For being brothers in their case does not have its origin in the Lord, and therefore in good, but in themselves, and therefore in position and gain. </p>
<p>[<a href="3803.htm">3803</a>a] 'And that 
he was Rebekah's son' means the link between these kindred varieties of good. This becomes clear without explanation, for Rebekah, who was Jacob's mother and Laban's sister, was the one in whom the 
link existed. </p>

`Et indicabat Jacob Racheli, quod frater patris ejus ille': </p>
<p>quod significet affinitatem boni quod Jacob, et boni quod Laban, constat ex significatione `indicare' quod sit notum facere; a repraesentatione 
`Jacobi' quod sit bonum, de qua prius; ex repraesentatione `Rachelis' cui notum factum, quod sit affectio veri interioris, de qua n. 3793; ex significatione `fratris' qui hic Jacob, quod sit 
bonum, de qua n. 367, 2360, 3303, 3459; et ex significatione `patris,' qui hic Laban, quod quoque' sit bonum, de qua n. 3703; inde et ex serie patet quod per `indicabat Jacob Racheli, quod frater 
patris ejus ille' significetur affinitas boni quod `Jacob,' et boni quod `Laban'; sed ipsam affinitatem exponere, et inde utriusque conjunctionem {1} per affectionem veri interioris quae `Rachel,' 
foret rem in obscurum mittere, quia pauci sciunt quid bonum naturalis, et quod hoc distinctum sit a bono rationalis, et quid bonum communis stirpis collaterale, et quoque quid affectio veri interioris; 
qui non aliquam ideam de his sibi comparavit ex propria indagatione, levem si aliquam accipit ex descriptione, tantum enim homo ex aliis recipit, quantum vel ex proprio habet, vel per intuitionem 
rei apud se sibi acquirit, reliqua praeterlabuntur; satis est scire quod innumerabiles affinitates boni et veri sint, et quod secundum illas sint societates caelestes, videatur n. 685, 917, 2739, 
3612.  [2] Quod Jacob se dicat fratrem Labanis cum tamen erat filius sororis ejus, est quia ex bono omnes fratres sunt, inde quoque est quod Laban Jacobum vicissim fratrem appellet, vers. 15; 
bonum enim est quod facit consanguineum, et quod conjungit, nam bonum est amoris, et amor est conjunctio spiritualis; inde erat quod in antiquis Ecclesiis omnes illi qui in bono fuerunt dicti sint 
fratres, etiam in Ecclesia Judaica, sed quia haec omnes alios vilipendit, et se solos electos putavit, modo illos appellabat fratres qui nati Judaei fuerunt, et reliquos socios, aut {2} alienos; primitiva 
Ecclesia Christiana etiam omnes vocabat fratres qui in bono, at postea solum illos qui intra suum coetum fuerunt; sed fratris nomen cum bono apud Christianos evanuit, et quando verum loco boni, 
seu fides loco charitatis successit, tunc non ex bono se amplius dicere potuerunt fratres, sed proximum; hoc quoque secum habet doctrina fidei absque vita charitatis, quod infra se videatur esse 
fraternitas cum viliore se; fraternitas enim apud eos non originem ducit a Domino ac inde a bono, sed a se, et inde honore et lucro.      {3} `Et quod filius Rebeccae ille': quod significet affinitatum 
conjunctionem, constare potest absque explicatione; </p>
