<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4911节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4911.</strong>“犹大承认”表因为这些是他们的，所以他们作出肯定。这从“承认”的含义清楚可知，“承认”是指肯定，这是因为他凭信物承认她所怀的孩子是他的。这段经文描述了这个民族的秉性，其秉性是这样：尽管这个民族将教会的内在弃如虚假，然而在接受这内在属于它的暗示时，他们仍接受并肯定它。那些如这个民族那样陷入爱的污秽，也就是陷入贪婪，同时陷入自我之爱的人不能提升自己的心智，从其它角度而非自我看待真理。因此，当一个真理被归给他们自己时，他们肯定它。例如，他们若被告知，圣言本身是神性，包含天堂的奥秘，以及诸如只能被天使理解的那种奥秘，就肯定这个真理，因为他们把圣言看成是他们自己的，圣言是为了他们，在他们中间，在字面上与他们有关。但是，若奥秘或属灵真理本身被透露给他们，他们就会拒绝它们。<br />他们若被告知，其教会的仪式本身都是神圣的，就肯定这个真理，因为他们将这些仪式看成是他们自己的。但他们若被告知，那些神圣事物居于内，然而却脱离这些仪式，就会否认。再如，若他们被告知，犹太教会是属天的，以色列教会是属灵的，并且若有人真的向他们解释何为属天的和属灵的，他们也会肯定这一点。但他们若被告知，这些教会之所以被称为属天和属灵的，是因为它们里面的一切细节都代表属灵和属灵之物，这种代表关注实际事物，而非这个人，他们就会否认它。又如，他们若被告知，摩西的杖拥有来自耶和华的权能，因而拥有神性大能，就会肯定这一点，称其为真理。但他们若被告知，这种权能不在这杖上，只在神性诫命中，就会否认这一点，并称其为虚假。<br />他们若被告知，摩西所举的铜蛇医治了那些被蛇所咬的人，因而这个东西是奇迹，就会肯定它。但他们若被告知，它里面并没有医治或异能，这些都出于它所代表的主，则会否认它，称其为虚假（对比各处经文关于蛇的记载和阐述，民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.7.htm">21:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">9</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下18.4.htm">18:4</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.15.htm">15</a>）。他们在被告知的其它一切事上的反应也是如此。这些就是“犹大承认”所表示的事，并且就这个民族而言，犹大所表之物与“他玛”所代表的教会内在相结合。由于这就是这些事物的性质，所以犹大亲近他，不是像一个近亲属亲近已故丈夫的妻子，而是像一个嫖客亲近一个妓女。</p>

And Judah acknowledged them. That this signifies that being theirs they made affirmation, is evident from the signification of "acknowledging," as being to affirm, and this because he acknowledged from 
the pledges that it was his. In this passage the genius of that nation is described, which is such that though they reject the internal of the church as false, yet when it is insinuated into them that 
it is theirs, they accept and affirm it. They who are in the filth of loves, that is, in avarice, and at the same time in the love of self, as that nation is, cannot elevate the mind's view and see 
truth from any other source than self; and therefore when it is attributed to themselves, they affirm it. For example, if they are told that the Word in itself is Divine, and contains arcana of heaven, 
and also such arcana as can be comprehended only by angels, they affirm this to be true, for they regard the Word as their own, because it was for them, among them, and treats of them in the letter; 
but if the arcana or spiritual truths themselves are disclosed to them, they reject them. [2] If they are told that the rituals of their church were all holy in themselves, they affirm this to be 
true, because they regard these rituals as their own; but if it is said that those holy things were in the rituals apart from them, this they deny. Again, if they should be told that the Jewish Church 
was celestial and the Israelitish Church spiritual, and if it were explained to them what the celestial and spiritual are, they would affirm this also; but if it were said that these churches are called 
celestial and spiritual for the reason that every particular in them represented celestial and spiritual things, and that representatives have regard to the thing and not to the person, they would 
deny it. Again, if they are told that in the staff of Moses there was power from Jehovah, and thus Divine power, they affirm it and call it true; but if they are told that this power was not in the staff, 
but only in the Divine command, this they deny and call it false. [3] If they are told that the brazen serpent set up by Moses healed those who were bitten by serpents, and thus that it was miraculous, 
they affirm it; but if it is said that it was not healing and miraculous in itself, but from the Lord who was represented, they deny it and call it false. (Compare what is related and said of 
the serpent in several passages, Num. 21:7-9; 2 Kings 18:4; John 3:14, 15.) So also in all other instances. Such are the things which are signified by Judah's acknowledging, and which on the part of 
the nation signified by him were conjoined with the internal of the church which is represented by Tamar; and because they were such, Judah did not come to her as a husband's brother to a wife, but as 
a whoremonger to a harlot. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4911</b></p><p><b>4911.</b>
'And Judah acknowledged them' means that because these were theirs they affirmed that they were. This is clear from the meaning of 'acknowledging' as affirming, in this case because he acknowledged from 
the pledges that the child she was carrying was his own. Described here is that nation's predisposition, which is such that although it rejects any internal truth of the Church as a falsity, that 
nation nevertheless accepts and affirms such truth on receiving an intimation that this does belong to it. People who are governed, as this nation is, by loves that are filthy- that is, by avarice and 
by self-love accompanying this - are unable to raise their minds to a level where truth is seen from a viewpoint other than themselves. Therefore when a truth is attributed to them they affirm it. For 
example, if they are told that the Word is inwardly Divine and contains the arcana of heaven and also the kind of arcana that only angels comprehend, they affirm this truth because they regard the Word 
to be their own since it came to them, exists with them, and in the letter has to do with them. But if the actual arcana - spiritual truths - are disclosed to them they reject them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 If they 
are told that every one of the ritual observances of their Church are inwardly holy, they affirm this truth because they regard those observances to be their own. But if they are told that such holiness 
dwells within, yet is separate from those observances, they refuse to accept this. If they are told that the Jewish Church was celestial and the Israelitish Church spiritual, and if they are given 
an explanation of what the celestial is, and what the spiritual is, they affirm that also. But if they were told that these two Churches are called celestial and spiritual from the fact that all the 
particular aspects of them were representative of celestial and spiritual things, and that representatives have regard to the reality represented, not to the one who represents it, they refuse to accept 
it. If they are told that Moses' rod had power from Jehovah, and so had Divine power within it, they affirm this and call it the truth. But if they are told that this power did not lie in the rod, 
only in the Divine command, they refuse to accept it and call it a falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 If they are told that the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses healed those who were bitten by the serpents and that this 
object was for that reason miraculous, they affirm it. But if they are told that no healing or miraculous power lay within it but these came from the Lord whom that object represented, they refuse to 
accept this and call it a falsity. (Compare what has been narrated and stated about that serpent in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:7-9;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:7-9; 2</a> Kings 18:4; John 3:14, <a href="15.htm">15</a>.) They react in the same way to everything else they are 
told. These are the kinds of things that are meant by 'Judah acknowledged them' and which on the part of the nation meant by him were joined to that internal aspect of the Church represented by 'Tamar'. 
Also, such being the nature of those things, Judah did not go in to her as a near kinsman going in to a dead husband's wife but as a fornicator going in to a prostitute. </p>

</p><b>4911.</b>
`Et agnovit Jehudah': quod significet quia suum quod affirmaret, constat a significatione `agnoscere' quod sit affirmare, et hoc quia ex pignoribus agnovit quod suum esset. Describitur hic genius 
illius gentis, qui talis est quod tametsi internum Ecclesiae sicut falsum rejicit, usque tamen cum insinuatur ei quod illius sit, acceptet et affirmet; qui in sorde amorum sunt, hoc est, in avaritia 
et simul in amore sui, ut haec gens est, non possunt elevare mentis intuitionem et videre verum aliunde quam ex se, quapropter cum illis tribuitur, tunc affirmant; sicut pro exemplo: si illis dicitur 
quod Verbum in se Divinum sit et contineat arcana caeli, et quoque talia arcana quae solum ab angelis comprehendi possunt, hoc verum affirmant quoniam Verbum faciunt suum quia fuit ad illos, 
apud illos, et in littera de illis, sed ipsa arcana seu vera spiritualia si illis 2 detegantur, rejiciunt. Si illis dicitur quod ritualia Ecclesiae eorum omnia sancta fuerint in se, hoc verum affirmant 
quia ritualia illa sua faciunt; sed si dicitur quod sancta illa fuerint in ritualibus separata ab illis, hoc negant. Si illis dicitur quod Ecclesia Judaica fuerit caelestis et Ecclesia Israelitica 
spiritualis et si illis explicatur quid caeleste et quid spirituale, id quoque affirmarent; sed si diceretur quod Ecclesiae illae dicantur caelestes et spirituales ex eo quod singula ibi repraesentaverint caelestia 
et spiritualia, et quod repraesentativa spectent rem non personam, id negant. Si illis dicitur quod in baculo Mosis fuerit potentia a Jehovah, ita potentia Divina, id affirmant 
et vocant verum; at si illis dicitur quod potentia illa non fuerit in baculo, 3 sed solum in mandato Divino, hoc negant et vocant falsum. Si illis dicitur quod serpens aeneus a Mose erectus sanaverit 
illos qui mordebantur a serpentibus et sic quod miraculosus fuisset, id affirmant; sed si dicitur quod non fuerit sanans et miraculosus in se, sed ex Domino {1}Qui repraesentabatur, id negant 
et vocant falsum; conferantur quae de serpente {2}relata et dicta sunt, Num. xxi 7-9; 2 Reg. xviii 4;Joh. iii 14, 15; similiter in reliquis. Talia sunt quae significantur per quod `agnovit Jehudah', 
et quae a parte gentis per illum significatae conjungebantur cum interno Ecclesiae quod per `Tamarem' repraesentatur; et quia talia fuerunt, non intravit Jehudah ad illam ut levir ad uxorem, sed 
ut scortator ad meretricem.{3} @1 quem repraesentavit but quem is altered to qui$ @2 illo$ @3 A has many alterations in this last sentence, including a deletion of nequidem. Possibly non should 
have taken its place, but in A's final version, the former part gives Tamar's idea, the latter Judah's.$ </p>
