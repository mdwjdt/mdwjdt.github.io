<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4947节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4947.</strong>那些活在肉身时过着世俗、自我放纵生活的人也住在脚底之下。他们以世俗事物为乐，喜欢过奢华的生活；但他们的动机完全是外在或肉体的欲望，而不是任何内在或心灵的渴望。因为他们在灵里并不傲慢，即便身居要职，也不将自己置于他人之上。他们在如此生活中出于肉体行事，因而并未拒绝教会的教导，更没有确认反对它们，而是发自内心宣称这些教导是真理，因为那些学习圣言的人知道它们是真理。这类人中有些人的内层向天堂敞开，天堂的美德，即公义、正直、虔诚、仁爱和怜悯逐渐被植入他们；后来，他们就被提入天堂。</p>

Under the soles of the feet are they also who in the life of the body have lived for the world and their own pleasure, being delighted with such things as are of the world, and have loved to live in 
splendor, but only from external cupidity or that of the body, not from internal desire or that of the mind; for they have not been proud in spirit - setting themselves before others - though in stations 
of honor; thus in so living they have acted from the body, and therefore have not rejected the teachings of the church, still less confirmed themselves against them, but at heart have said of them 
that it is so, because those who study the Word know it. In some who are of this character, the interiors are open toward heaven, and into them are successively inseminated heavenly things, such as justice, 
uprightness, piety, charity, and mercy; and they are afterward taken up into heaven. </p>

Also beneath the soles of the feet there are those who during their lifetime led a worldly, self-indulgent life. They took delight in things of a worldly nature and liked to live in splendour; but they 
were motivated by a wholly external or bodily desire to do so, not by any internal or mental desire. For they were not haughty, setting themselves up above others even when appointed to eminent positions. 
This being the kind of life they led, they were motivated by the body. Consequently people such as these have not rejected the teachings of the Church, still less hardened themselves against them. 
In their hearts they have declared these teachings to be the truth, because those who study the Word know that they are. With some of this kind of people their interiors have been opened towards 
heaven, and within these, heavenly virtues are implanted - righteousness, uprightness, devotion, charity, and mercy. After that they are raised up to heaven </p>

Sub plantis pedum etiam sunt qui in vita corporis vixerunt mundo et genio, delectati talibus quae sunt mundi, et amaverunt vivere splendide, sed modo ex cupiditate externa seu corporis, non autem 
{1} ab interna seu mentis: non enim superbiverunt animo, se aliis praeferendo, tametsi in dignitate constituti; {2} quod ita vixerint, ex corpore egerunt; quare tales nec rejecerunt doctrinalia Ecclesiae, 
minus confirmarunt se contra illa; corde suo dixerunt de illis quod ita sit, quia illi qui student Verbo, id sciunt; apud quosdam qui tales, interiora aperta sunt versus caelum, quibus successive 
inseminantur caelestia, nempe justitia, probitas, pietas, charitas, misericordia, et dein elevantur in caelum. @1 ita$ @2 i nam$ </p>
