<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5563节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5563.</strong>有时在颅骨会感到疼痛，有时在这个部位，有时在那个部位；这时，在那里会感觉看似结节的东西和其它骨头分开，因而是疼痛的源头。<br />我通过经历得以知道，这种疼痛是由源于恶欲的虚假造成的。令人惊奇的是，虚假的属和种在头骨中有自己的固定位置，我通过大量经历也已经知道这一点。对经历改造的人来说，这些结节，即硬块，被分解并变软；这一切是通过各种方法实现的，一般来说，通过在良善与真理上的教导、造成内在疼痛的真理的强势涌入和造成外在疼痛的实际撕裂实现。源于恶欲的虚假具有这样的性质：它们会造成坚硬；因为它们是真理的对立面。真理因照着天堂的形式成形，故可以说自发、自由、柔和、轻轻地流动。但虚假因倾向于与天堂相反的方向，故所取的形式是相反的。结果，属于天堂形式的流动被阻断，由此产生硬化。因此，那些陷入致命仇恨和这种仇恨的报复，并由此陷入虚假的人就有完全硬化的头骨。有些人的头骨就像象牙；光线，也就是真理无法穿透进来，而是被完全反射回去。</p>

Pains are sometimes felt in the skull, now in one part, now in another; and nuclei seem to be perceived there which are separate from the other bones, and which thus are in pain. It has been given me 
to know by experience that such pains come from falsities originating in cupidities; and wonderful to say the genera and species of falsities have fixed places in the skull, as has also been made known 
to me by much experience. Such nuclei, which are indurations, are broken up and made soft in those who are being reformed; and this is done in various ways, in general by instructions in good and truth, 
by harsh influxes of truths which cause inward pain, and by actual rendings which cause outward pain. Falsities from cupidities are of such a nature that they produce hardness; for they are contrary 
to truths, which because they are determined according to the form of heaven, flow as it were spontaneously, freely, gently, and softly, while falsities, being of a contrary tendency, have opposite 
determinations, so that the flow which is of the form of heaven is stopped; hence the indurations. From this cause they who have been in deadly hatred and in the revengefulness of such hatred, and 
from these in falsities, have skulls completely indurated, and some have skulls like ebony, through which no rays of light, which are truths, penetrate, but are wholly reflected. </p>

Occasionally pains are felt in the skull, sometimes in one part, at other times in another, when what seem like nodules which are separate from all other bones and so are the source of the pains are 
detected there. Experience has taught me that things of this nature are caused by falsities originating in evil desires. And what is a marvel, the genera and species of falsities have their own particular 
locations in the skull, as considerable experience has also enabled me to know. In the case of people undergoing reformation such nodules, which are pieces of hardness, are broken down and made soft; 
and this is done in a variety of ways. In general it is done by means of instruction in what is good and true, by means of incisive inroads made by truths, an activity accompanied by pain inwardly, 
and also by means of actual tearings apart, an activity accompanied by pain outwardly. For falsities originating in evil desires are of such a nature as to cause hardness; they are the opposite of 
truths. In the case of truths, because they take shape in accord with the shape heaven takes, they flow so to speak spontaneously, freely, gently, and softly. But the shape taken by falsities is the opposite 
because they incline in the opposite direction from heaven. As a consequence that flow associated with the form taken by heaven is blocked and hardnesses develop. For this reason those in whom 
deadly hatred and desires for revenge accompanying such hatred have existed, and in whom falsities originating in such desires have been present, possess skulls that are completely hardened. Some have 
skulls like ivory, which no rays of light, which are truths, can penetrate but are altogether turned back. </p>

In cranio sentiuntur aliquoties dolores, nunc in una parte nunc in altera, et appercipiuntur quasi nuclei ibi qui separati a reliquis ossibus, qui ita dolent; per experientiam scire datum est quod (t)talia 
existant (c)a falsis quae ex cupiditatibus; et quod mirabile, falsorum genera et species certa in cranio loca habent, quod etiam per plurem experientiam mihi notum factum est.  Tales nuclei qui 
sunt indurationes, apud illos qui reformantur, franguntur et ad mollitiem rediguntur, et {1} hoc variis modis; in genere per informationes in bono et vero, per influxus veritatum acerbos, quod fit cum 
dolore interiore, tum per discerptiones actuales, quod fit {2} cum dolore exteriore.  Falsa enim ex cupiditatibus talis naturae sunt ut indurent; sunt enim contraria veris, et vera quia determinantur 
secundum formam caeli, fluunt sicut sponte, libere, leniter, molliter; at falsa quia in contrarium tendunt, habent determinationes oppositas, unde fluidum, quod est formae caeli, sistitur, inde indurationes 
(m)Inde est quod qui in odio internecino fuerunt, ac in vindictis talis odii et ex his in falsis, crania {3}habeant prorsus indurata, et {4}quidam sicut ebena per quae nulli radii lucis, quae 
sunt vera, penetrant, sed prorsus reflectuntur(n). @1 sed$ @2 quae fiunt$ @3 eorum sint$ @4 quorundam$ </p>
