<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1016节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1016.</strong>“在地上滋生、增多”表外在人，就是“地”中良善与真理的增加，“滋生”涉及良善，“增多”涉及真理。这从刚才所述，以及“地”的含义清楚可知，“地”表外在人。关于这些含义，可参看对本章第一节的论述（<a href="983.htm">983</a>节）。<br />经上说“在地上滋生、增多”是基于以下原因：对重生之人而言，没有任何事物会在外在人中增多，即没有任何良善或真理会增多，除非它是仁爱的产物。仁爱就象春天或夏天的热，使草木生长。没有仁爱或属灵之热则寸草不生，故此处经上先说“在地上滋生”，这句话涉及从仁爱流出的良善，良善与真理藉着“滋生”而增多。谁都能明白这是怎么回事；若非有某种情感，没有什么东西会在人里面生长增多。情感的快乐不仅会使某种事物扎根，还会促使它生长。一切皆取决于情感的影响。<br />凡人所爱之物，他都会自由接受、保留和珍视之，并因此接受、保留和珍视支持某种情感的一切事物。而对于那些不支持的事物，他则漠不关心，视而不见，甚至拒绝之。不过，情感的性质决定了增多的性质。对重生之人而言，这情感就是对源于主所赋予的仁之良善和真理的情感。因此，凡支持源于仁爱的情感之物，他都会接受、保留和珍视之，并因此在良善和真理方面更加坚定。这就是“在地上滋生、增多”所表之义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1016.</strong> The fact that pour out into the earth and multiply on it symbolizes increasing goodness and truth in our outer self, which is the earth, and that pouring out has to do with goodness, and multiplying with truth, can be seen from the remarks just above. It can also be seen from the symbolism of the earth as the outer self. For these meanings, see the statements and illustrations at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_1" target=_top>1</a> of the present chapter, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983" target=_top>983</a>.{*1} [2] The reason the text speaks of pouring out into the earth and consequently multiplying on it is this: In the outer self of a regenerate person, nothing multiplies — nothing good or true increases — if charity does not have an effect on it. Charity is like springtime or summertime warmth, which makes grain, grasses, and trees grow. Without charity, or spiritual warmth, nothing grows. That is why the current verse says "pour out into the earth" first. This clause has to do with goodness, which is a matter of charity and which causes goodness and truth to multiply.<br />Anyone can grasp what the situation is here: nothing inside us grows or multiplies without some kind of affection [or desire]. The pleasure afforded by affection makes things not only put down root but also grow. Everything proceeds in accord with affection's influence.<br />[3] What we love we willingly seize, hold on to, and keep. Anything that supports our desires we likewise seize, hold on to, and keep. If something fails to support our desires, we have no interest in it; we discount and in fact reject it.<br />The kind of affection we have, however, determines how things multiply in us. When we have been reborn, our affection for goodness and truth develops out of an impulse for charity granted by the Lord. So any argument supporting a charitable affection is something we seize, hold on to, and protect, and we use it to strengthen the goodness and truth inside us. This is what "pour out into the earth and multiply" means.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the earth as symbol of the outer self, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_27" target=_top>27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_909" target=_top>909</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913" target=_top>913</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1016/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_984" target=_top>984</a> (which last may be the intended reference here).

Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and be ye multiplied therein. That this signifies increase of good and truth in the external man, which is the earth; and that "to bring forth abundantly" is predicated 
of goods, and "to be multiplied" of truths, is evident from what has now been said, and also from the signification of "earth" as being the external man, concerning which significations see what 
was said and shown at the first verse of this chapter (n. 983). As to its being said, "Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and be ye multiplied therein" the case is this: nothing is multiplied with 
the regenerate man in his external man, that is, nothing of good and truth receives increase, except as the effect of charity. Charity is like heat in the time of spring or summer, which causes grass 
and plants and trees to grow. Without charity, or spiritual heat, nothing grows, and for this reason it is here said in the first place, "Bring forth abundantly in the earth" which is predicated of the 
goods that are of charity, by means of which there is multiplication of good and truth. Anyone may understand how this is; for nothing is increased and multiplied in man unless there be some affection, 
for it is the delight of the affection that causes it not only to take root, but also to increase, and everything depends upon the influence of the affection. What a man loves he freely learns, retains, 
and cherishes-thus all things that favor any affection. Those which do not favor, the man cares nothing for, regards as nothing, and even rejects. But such as the affection is, such is the multiplication. 
With the regenerate man the affection is that of good and truth from the charity that is given by the Lord. Whatever therefore favors that affection of charity he learns, retains, and cherishes, 
and thus confirms himself in goods and truths. This is signified by, "Bring forth abundantly in the earth and be ye multiplied therein." </p>

'Swarm over the earth and multiply in it' means increases in good and truth in the external man, which man is 'the earth' - 'swarming' having reference to goods, and 'multiplying' to truths. This is 
clear from what has just been stated, and also from the meaning of 'the earth' as the external man. For these matters, see what has been stated and shown at verse 1 of this chapter, in <a href="983.htm">983</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The 
expressions 'swarm over the earth' and so 'multiply in it' are used for the following reason: With a regenerate person nothing multiplies in his external man, that is, no good or truth at all is ever 
increased, unless it is the product of charity. Charity is like the warmth in springtime or summer that causes grass, plants, and trees to grow. Without charity, or spiritual warmth, nothing grows, and 
this is why the first expression used here is 'swarm over the earth' which has reference to goods that flow from charity, by means of which good and truth are multiplied. Anyone may grasp how this 
is so; nothing with a person grows and multiplies unless some affection is there. The delight that is part of the affection not only causes something to take root, but also causes it to grow. Everything 
depends on the influence of the affection. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That which a person loves he freely takes in, retains, and treasures - and so everything that supports some affection. Those which do not support it 
he has no interest in, regards as worthless, in fact rejects. But the character of the affection determines that of the multiplication. With somebody who is regenerate it is an affection for good and 
truth deriving from charity given by the Lord. Consequently whatever supports an affection deriving from charity he takes in, retains, and treasures, and so strengthens himself in goods and truths. 
This is what is meant by 'swarm over the earth and multiply'. </p>

'Effundimini in terram et multiplicamini in ea': quod significent incrementa boni et veri in externo homine, qui est terra, et quod 'effundi' praedicetur de bonis, et 'multiplicari' de veris, ex illis 
quae mox dicta sunt, constat; tum ex significatione 'terrae' quod sit externus homo, de quibus videantur quae dicta et ostensa sunt ad vers. 1 hujus capitis n. 983.  [2] Quod effundi in terram, et 
sic multiplicari in ea dicatur, ita se res habet: apud regeneratum hominem nihil multiplicatur in externo ejus homine, hoc est, nihil boni et veri incrementa capit nisi per charitatis effectum; charitas 
est quasi calor tempore veris seu aestatis, qui facit ut gramina, herbae et arbores crescant; absque charitate seu calore spirituali nihil crescit, quare hic primum dicitur 'effundimini in terram,' 
quod praedicatur de bonis quae sunt charitatis, per quae multiplicatio boni et veri; quisque capere potest quomodo hoc se habet; nihil apud hominem crescit et multiplicatur nisi sit aliqua affectio; 
affectionis jucundum facit ut non solum radicem agat sed etiam crescat; secundum affectionis aspirationem omnia fiunt; [3] quod amat homo, hoc libenter arripit, retinet et custodit; ita omnia quae favent 
alicui affectioni; quae non favent, ea homo nihil curat, respicit sicut nihil, immo rejicit; sed qualis affectio, talis multiplicatio; apud regeneratum est affectio boni et veri ex charitate a Domino 
donata, quare quicquid favet affectioni charitatis, hoc arripit, retinet et custodit, et ita confirmat se in bonis et veris; quae significantur per 'effundimini in terram, et multiplicamini.' </p>
