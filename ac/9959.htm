<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9959.</strong>“要给他们作亚麻布裤子”表婚姻之爱的一个外层或外在之物。这“裤子”和“亚麻布”的含义清楚可知：“裤子”是指婚姻之爱的一个外层或外在之物，如下文所述；“亚麻布”是指外在真理或属世真理，也如下文所述。“裤子”之所以表示婚姻之爱的一个外层或外在之物，是因为衣服或遮盖物从它们所遮盖的身体部位获得自己的含义（参看<a href="9827.htm">9827</a>节），裤子所披或所盖的腰部和生殖器官表示婚姻之爱。“腰”就具有这种含义（参看<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>节）；“生殖器官”也具有这种含义（<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>，<a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>节）。下文（<a href="9960.htm">9960</a>节）将阐述何为真正的婚姻之爱。<br />裤子之所以用亚麻布或亚麻来作，是因为“亚麻布”或“亚麻”表示外在真理或属世真理（<a href="7601.htm">7601</a>节），构成外在本身的，是真理。真理构成外在的原因是，内在事物终止于外在事物，并立在其上如同立在它们的底层支撑上；良善的底层支撑就是真理。它们就像一座房子建于或立于其上的地基或根基；因此，“房子的地基或根基”表示源于良善的信之真理（参看<a href="9643.htm">9643</a>节）。此外，真理也是那保护良善免受邪恶和虚假伤害，并抵挡它们的；良善所拥有的一切能力都是通过真理来行使的（<a href="9643.htm">9643</a>节）。正因如此，那些处于源于良善的信之真理的人住在天堂的最后和最低部分；也正因如此，人身上最后或最外在的东西，即他外面的皮肤对应于天堂中那些处于信之真理的人（<a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5559.htm">5559</a>，<a href="8980.htm">8980</a>节）；但不对应于那些持守与良善分离之信的人，因为这些人并不在天堂。由此可见为何裤子要用亚麻布或亚麻来作。但当亚伦穿上为荣耀为华美的衣服（它们是本章论述的主题）时，他的裤子是用捻的细麻制成的亚麻布来作的，这从后面的章节明显看出来，在那里，经上说：<br />他们用细麻布、用编织的工作内袍，并用细麻作冠冕和用细麻作华美的裹头巾，用捻的细麻做亚麻布裤子。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.27.htm">39:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.28.htm">28</a>）<br />当亚伦穿圣衣时，他的裤子只用亚麻布来作，这一点从摩西五经中的这些话清楚看出来：<br />亚伦进圣所的幔子内的时候，要穿上亚麻布圣内袍，把亚麻布裤子穿在身上，腰束亚麻布带子，将亚麻布冠冕戴在自己身上。这些都是圣衣。他要用水洗身，然后穿上它们。要先献上燔祭和祭物，通过它们为圣所赎罪，免除污秽。（利未记16章）<br />那时亚伦之所以要穿上也被称为“圣衣”的亚麻衣服，是因为那时，他正在履行为会幕，以及百姓和他自己赎罪，免除污秽的职责。通过洗濯、燔祭和祭物而实现的一切赎罪，都代表心洁除邪恶和虚假，因而代表重生；洁除邪恶和虚假，或重生通过信之真理实现。这就是为何那时亚伦穿亚麻衣服，因为“亚麻衣服”表示信之真理，如前所述。洁除邪恶和虚假都是通过信之真理实现的（参看<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>e，<a href="7044.htm">7044</a>，<a href="7918.htm">7918</a>，<a href="9089.htm">9089</a>节）；因此，重生也通过信之真理实现（<a href="1555.htm">1555</a>，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2979.htm">2979</a>，<a href="3332.htm">3332</a>，<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>，<a href="3690.htm">3690</a>，<a href="3786.htm">3786</a>，<a href="3876.htm">3876</a>，<a href="3877.htm">3877</a>，<a href="4096.htm">4096</a>，<a href="4097.htm">4097</a>，<a href="5893.htm">5893</a>，<a href="6247.htm">6247</a>，<a href="8635.htm">8635</a>，<a href="8638.htm">8638</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>，<a href="8772.htm">8772</a>，<a href="9088.htm">9088</a>，<a href="9089.htm">9089</a>，<a href="9103.htm">9103</a>节）。<br />由于同样的原因，当祭司从祭坛上收灰时，他就穿上亚麻衣服，亚麻裤子（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.10.htm">6:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.11.htm">11</a>）；祭司利未人撒督的子孙进圣所的时候，也要这样做；对此，我们在以西结书读到：<br />祭司利未人撒督的子孙，必进入我的圣所，就近我的桌前事奉我。他们进内院门必穿亚麻衣服；在内院门和殿内供职的时候，身上不可穿羊毛衣服。他们头上要戴亚麻布裹头巾，腰穿亚麻布裤子。不可穿使身体出汗的衣服。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.15.htm">44:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是新殿，新殿表示新教会；“利未人撒督”表示那些处于源于良善的真理之人；“亚麻衣服”表示用来实现洁净和重生的信之真理；“不可穿使身体出汗的衣服”表示敬拜的神圣事物不可与人的自我，或人自己的东西混杂；因为“汗”表示人的自我，或人自己的东西；而人的自我，或人自己的东西无非是邪恶和虚假（<a href="210.htm">210</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>，<a href="987.htm">987</a>，<a href="1047.htm">1047</a>，<a href="3812.htm">3812</a>e，<a href="8480.htm">8480</a>，<a href="8941.htm">8941</a>节）。<br />当亚伦穿上为荣耀为华美的衣服时，他所穿的裤子之所以是用捻的细麻制成的亚麻布作的（这从前面引用的经文，即出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.27.htm">39:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.28.htm">28</a>明显看出来），是因为亚伦穿上这些衣服就代表天堂里的神性良善方面的主；亚伦本人则代表那里神性属天层方面的主；他的衣服代表那里从神性属天层发出的神性属灵层方面的主（<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>节）；“细麻”表示从神性属天层发出的神性属灵层（<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>，<a href="9469.htm">9469</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt make for them breeches of linen. That this signifies what is external of conjugial love, is evident from the signification of "breeches," as being what is external of love (of which below); 
and from the signification of "linen," as being external truth, or natural truth (of which also below). The reason why "breeches" signify what is external of conjugial love, is that garments or 
coverings derive their signification from that part of the body which they cover (see n. 9827), and the loins together with the genitals, which are clothed or covered by the breeches, signify conjugial 
love. (That "the loins" have this signification, see n. 3021, 4280, 4575; and also "the genitals," n. 4462, 5050-5062.) What love truly conjugial is, shall be told in the following article. [2] The 
reason why the breeches were made of linen, was that "linen" signifies external truth, that is, natural truth (n. 7601), and the external itself is truth. The reason why the external is truth, is that 
internal things cease in external ones, and rest upon these as their supports; and supports are truths. They are like the foundations on which a house is built; and therefore "the foundations of a house" 
signify truths of faith from good (see n. 9643). Moreover, truths are what protect goods from evils and falsities, and resist them; and all the power which good has is by means of truths (n. 9643). 
From this also it is that in the ultimate of heaven are those who are in truths of faith from good; and therefore also the ultimate, or outermost, with man, which is his outer skin, corresponds to 
those in the heavens who are in truths of faith (n. 5552-5559, 8980); but not to those who are in faith separate from good, for these are not in heaven. From all this it can now be seen why the breeches 
were of linen. But when Aaron was clothed in garments which were for glory and comeliness (which have been treated of in this chapter), his breeches were of linen with fine linen interwoven, as is 
evident from what follows, where it is said: </p>
<p>     They made the tunics of fine linen, the work of the weaver, and the miter of fine linen, and the adornments of the tiaras of fine linen, and the breeches 
of linen with fine linen interwoven (Exod. 39:27, 28). But when he was clothed in the garments of holiness, Aaron's breeches were of linen, as is evident from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     When Aaron 
shall enter into the holiness within the veil, he shall put on the linen tunic of holiness, and the linen breeches shall be put upon his flesh, and he shall gird himself with the linen belt, and 
he shall put on himself the linen miter; these are the garments of holiness; he shall also wash his flesh with water when he puts them on; and he shall then first offer burnt-offerings and sacrifices, 
by which he shall expiate the holiness from uncleanesses (Lev. 16). [3] The reason why Aaron then went clothed with linen garments, which were also called "garments of holiness," was that he then administered 
the office of expiating the Tent, as also the people and himself, from uncleannesses; and all expiation, which was effected by means of washings, burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, represented 
the purification of the heart from evils and falsities, thus regeneration; and purification from evils and falsities, or regeneration, is effected by means of the truths of faith. Therefore there were 
then linen garments upon Aaron, for as before said, by "the linen garments" were signified the truths of faith. (That all purification from evils and falsities is effected by means of the truths of 
faith, see n. 2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 9089; thus that regeneration is so effected, n. 1555, 2046, 2063, 2979, 3332, 3665, 3690, 3786, 3876, 3877, 4096, 4097, 5893, 6247, 8635, 8638-8640, 8772, 9088, 
9089, 9103.) [4] It was for the same reason that the priest put on linen clothing, and linen breeches, when he took the ashes away from the altar (Lev. 6:10, 11); and that the priests the Levites, of 
the sons of Zadok, were also to do the same when they should enter into the sanctuary, of which we read in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, shall enter into My sanctuary, and 
shall come near to My table, to minister to Me. When they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall put on linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, when they shall enter in 
at the gates of the inner court inward. There shall be linen tiaras upon their heads, and linen breeches shall be upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with sweat (Ezek. 44:15-18). The new 
temple is here treated of, by which is signified the New Church; by "the priests the Levites" are signified those who are in truths from good; by "the linen garments" are signified the truths of faith 
by means of which purification and regeneration are effected; "not to be girded with sweat" signifies that the holy things of worship were not to be commingled with what is man's own; for "sweat" denotes 
what is man's own; and what is man's own is nothing but evil and falsity (n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876, 987, 1047, 3812, 8480, 8941). [5] That the breeches worn by Aaron when he was clothed in garments 
for glory and comeliness were of linen with fine linen interwoven (as is evident from the passage cited above, Exod. 39:27, 28), was because in them Aaron represented the Lord as to Divine good 
in the heavens; Aaron himself the Lord as to the Divine celestial there; and his garments the Lord as to the Divine spiritual there proceeding from the Divine celestial (n. 9814); and "fine linen" denotes 
the Divine spiritual that proceeds from the Divine celestial (n. 5319, 9469). </p>

'And make for them linen undergarments' means an external level of conjugial love. This is clear from the meaning of 'undergarments' as an external level of conjugial love, dealt with below; and from 
the meaning of 'linen' as external truth or natural truth, also dealt with below. The reason why an external level of conjugial love is meant by 'undergarments' is that garments or coverings derive their 
meaning from the part of the body they cover, <a href="9827.htm">9827</a>, and the loins and genital organs, which the undergarments clothe or cover, mean conjugial love. For 'the loins' and their meaning this love, see <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>; and for 'the genital organs' and their meaning it, <a href="4462.htm">4462</a>, <a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>. What truly conjugial love is will be stated below in <a href="9960.htm">9960</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The undergarments were made from linen because 
'linen' or 'flax' means external truth or natural truth, <a href="7601.htm">7601</a>, and what constitutes the actual external is truth. The reason why truth constitutes the external is that internal things terminate in external 
ones and rest on them as their underlying supports, and the underlying supports of good are truths. These are like the foundations on which a house is built or on which a house rests, which is 
why the truths of faith springing from good are meant by the foundations of a house, <a href="9643.htm">9643</a>. Truths furthermore are what protect forms of good from and withstand evils and falsities, all the power that 
good possesses being exerted by means of truths, <a href="9643.htm">9643</a>. So it is also that the last and lowest part of heaven is inhabited by those who are guided by truths of faith springing from good. So it is also 
therefore that what is last or most external with a person, namely his external skin, corresponds to those in heaven who are guided by the truths of faith, <a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5559.htm">5559</a>, <a href="8980.htm">8980</a>, yet not to those who uphold 
faith separated from good, since they are not in heaven. From all this it may now be recognized why the undergarments were made from linen or flax. Aaron's undergarment however, when he was clothed 
with the garments which were 'for glorious adornment', and which have been the subject in the present chapter, was made of fine linen together with interwoven fine linen, as is evident from a later chapter 
where it says,  </p>
<blockquote>
They made tunics of fine linen, the work of a weaver, and a turban of fine linen, and attractive headdresses<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from fine linen, and linen undergarments with fine twined linen.

</blockquote>
<p>But when he was clothed with the 'holy garments' Aaron's undergarment was made of linen alone, as is clear from the following in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
When Aaron comes into the sanctuary within 
the veil he shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarment shall be over his flesh, and he shall gird himself with the linen belt, and place the linen turban on himself. These are holy 
garments. He shall also wash his flesh with water when he puts them on. He shall then first offer burnt offerings and sacrifices, by means of which he will expiate the holy place from uncleannesses.

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why Aaron was to go at that time clothed in the linen garments, which were also called 'the holy garments', was that at that time he was performing the duty of expiating 
the tent, and also the people and himself from uncleannesses. And every expiation, which was accomplished by means of washings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices, represented purification of the 
heart from evils and falsities, and so represented regeneration; and purification from evils and falsities, or regeneration, is accomplished by means of the truths of faith. This was why Aaron wore the 
linen garments then, for the truths of faith are meant by 'linen garments', as stated above.  </p>
<p>All purification from evils and falsities is accomplished by means of the truths of faith, see <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>,

 It was 
for the same reason also that the priest was to put on the linen robe and the linen undergarment when he carried the ash away from the altar, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:9-11</a>, and also that 'the priests, the Levites, from 
the sons of Zadok' were to put it on, when they entered the sanctuary, regarding whom the following is stated in Ezekiel,  </p>
<p>The priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, shall enter My sanctuary, and 
they shall draw near My table to minister to Me. When they enter the gates of the inner court they shall put on the linen garments, and no wool shall come upon them. When they minister in the gates 
of the inner court, and within, the linen turbans shall be on their heads, and the linen undergarments shall be over their loins. They shall not gird themselves with sweat.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2044:15-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 44:15-18</a>.  </p>
<p>The subject 
in this passage is the new temple, by which a new Church is meant. By 'the priests, the Levites' those guided by truths springing from good are meant, and by 'the linen garments' the truths of 
faith by means of which purification and regeneration are accomplished. 'Not girding themselves with sweat' means that the holy things of worship should not be mingled with the human self; for 'sweat' 
means the human self or proprium, and the human proprium is nothing but evil and falsity, <a href="210.htm">210</a>, <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>, <a href="987.htm">987</a>, <a href="1047.htm">1047</a>, <a href="3812.htm">3812</a> (end), <a href="8480.htm">8480</a>, <a href="8941.htm">8941</a>.  </p>

cum indutus fuit vestibus sanctitatis, erant ex lino, ut constat (c)ex his apud Moschen, 	Cum intrabit Aharon in sanctum intra velum, tunicam lini sanctitatis induet, et femoralia lini erunt super 
carne ejus, et balteo lini cinget se, et cidarim lini imponet sibi, vestes sanctitatis hae: etiam lavabit aquis carnem suam cum induet eas: et primo tunc offeret holocausta et sacrificia, per quae 
expiabit sanctum ab immunditiis, Lev. xvi 1-fin.; </p>
<p>3 quod Aharon tunc indutus iret vestibus lini, quae etiam vocabantur 'vestes sanctitatis,' erat causa quia tunc fungebatur munere expiandi tentorium, 
ut et populum ac semet ab immunditiis; et omnis expiatio, {7} quae fiebat per {8}lavationes, {9}holocausta, et sacrificia, repraesentabat purificationem cordis a malis et falsis, ita regenerationem; 
et purificatio a malis et falsis seu regeneratio fit per vera fidei; {10}ideo erant super Aharone tunc vestes lini, {11}nam per vestes lini significabantur vera fidei, ut supra dictum est; quod omnis 
purificatio a malis et falsis {12} (m)fiat per vera fidei,(n) videatur n. (x)2799, 5954 fin., 7044, 7918, (m)9089,(n) ita quod regeneratio, n. 1555, 2046, 2063, 2979, 3332, 3665, 3690, 3786, 3876, 3877, 
4096, 4097, 5893, 6247, 8635, 8638-8640, 8772, 9088, 9089, 9103. 	4 Ex eadem causa etiam erat quod sacerdos indueret amictum lini, et femoralia lini, cum tolleret cinerem ex altari, Lev. vi 2-4 [A. 
V. 9-11], et quoque quod sacerdotes Levitae ex filiis Zadochi, cum intrabunt in sanctuarium, de quibus ita apud Ezechielem, 	Sacerdotes Levitae, filii Zadochi, intrabunt in sanctuarium Meum, et accedent 
ad mensam Meam ad ministrandum Mihi; quando intrabunt ad portas atrii interioris, vestes lini induent, nec ascendet super eos lana; quando {13}ministrabunt in portis atrii interioris et introrsum, 
cidares lini erunt super capite eorum, et femoralia lini erunt super lumbis eorum; non accingent se cum sudore, xliv (x)15-18; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de novo templo, per quod significatur nova Ecclesia; per `sacerdotes 
Levitas' significantur qui in veris {14} ex bono, per `vestes lini' significantur vera fidei per quae purificatio et regeneratio; quod non accingerentur cum sudore, significat quod sancta cultus 
non commiscerentur cum proprio hominis, nam sudore est proprium hominis, ac proprium hominis non est nisi quam malum et falsum, n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876, 987, 1047, 3812 fin., 8480, 8941. 	Quod 
femoralia quae erant (m)Aharoni cum indutus erat vestibus 5 ad gloriam et decus, essent ex lino cum byssino intertexto, ut patet ex loco supra citato, Exod. xxxix 27, 28, erat causa quia Aharon in illis 
repraesentabat Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum in caelis, ipse Aharon {15}Dominum quoad Divinum Caeleste ibi, et per vestes quoad Divinum Spirituale ibi procedens ex Divino Caelesti, n.9814, ac byssinum 
est Divinum Spirituale procedens ex Divino Caelesti, n. 5319, 9469.(n) @1 amorem conjugialem$ @2 i causa$ @3 quod omnis potentia quae bono sit$ @4 i videatur$ @5 i supra$ @6 in$ @7 i ab immunditiis$ @8
