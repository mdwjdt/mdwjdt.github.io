<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5879节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5879.</strong>“我的父亲还活着吗”表来自属世层的属灵良善的存在。这从以色列的代表和“他还活着吗”的含义清楚可知：以色列，即此处的“父亲”，是指来自属世层的属灵良善（参看<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5807.htm">5807</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节），这良善来自属世层（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）；“他还活着吗”是指该良善的存在。因为当约瑟揭示自己谁时，他首先想到的是他的父亲，他要知道父亲还活着吗。所以，以色列首先出现在他的思维中，后来当约瑟与他的弟兄们交谈时，他也不断出现在约瑟的思维中。原因在于，内在属天层，即“约瑟”，若不通过来自属世层的属灵良善，即“以色列”，就无法与属世层中的真理，即“雅各的十个儿子”联结。并且一旦联结产生，他们就不再是雅各的儿子，而是以色列的儿子，因为“以色列的儿子”是属世层中的属灵真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5879</b></p><p><b>5879.</b>
Doth my father yet live? That this signifies the presence of spiritual good from the natural, is evident from the representation of Israel, who here is the "father," as being spiritual good from the 
natural (see n. 5801, 5803, 5807, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); that it is from the natural see n. 4286; and from the signification of "doth he yet live," as being the presence thereof. For Joseph's 
first thought when he manifested himself was about his father, whom he knew to be living. Wherefore Israel was first present in thought, and also continuously afterward while Joseph spoke to his brethren. 
The reason is that the conjunction of the internal celestial, which is "Joseph," cannot be effected with the truths in the natural, which are the "sons of Jacob," except through spiritual good from 
the natural, which is "Israel." And when conjunction is effected, then they are no longer the sons of Jacob, but the sons of Israel, for the "sons of Israel" are spiritual truths in the natural. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5879</b></p><p><b>5879.</b>
'Is my father still alive?' means the presence of spiritual good from the natural. This is clear from the representation of Israel, to whom 'father' refers here, as spiritual good from the natural, dealt 
with in <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a> (its derivation from the natural being dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>); and from the meaning of 'is he still alive?' as the presence of that good. For when 
he revealed who he was Joseph thought first about his father, whom he knew to be alive. His father was therefore present in his thought at the beginning, and also constantly after that when he talks 
to his brothers. The reason for this is that the internal celestial, which is 'Joseph', cannot become joined to the truths in the natural, which are 'the sons of Jacob', except through spiritual good 
from the natural, which is 'Israel'. And once that joining together has taken place they are no longer the sons of Jacob but the sons of Israel; for 'the sons of Israel' are spiritual truths within 
the natural.  </p>

</p><b>5879.</b>
`An adhuc pater meus vivit?': quod significet boni spiritualis e naturali praesentiam, constat ex repraesentatione `Israelis' qui hic `pater', quod sit bonum spirituale e naturali, de qua {1}n. 5801, 
5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, quod e naturali, n. 4286; et ex significatione `an adhuc vivit' quod sit praesentia ejus; cogitatio enim prima Josephi cum se manifestavit, erat de patre suo, 
quem scivit quod viveret, quapropter ille erat primum in cogitatione praesens, et quoque (t)postea continue cum ad fratres suos loquitur; causa est quia conjunctio caelestis interni quod `Joseph', 
non fieri potest cum veris in naturali quae `filii Jacobi, nisi per bonum spirituale e naturali quod `Israel'; et cum conjunctio facta, tunc non amplius sunt filii Jacobi, sed filii Israelis, nam `filii 
Israelis' sunt vera spiritualia in naturali. @1 A d these and i mox supra, n. 5877; I has all, but 5816 for 5819$ </p>
