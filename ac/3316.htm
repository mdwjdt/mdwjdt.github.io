<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3316节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3316.</strong>“雅各熬汤”表积聚在一起的教义。这从“雅各”的代表和“汤”的含义清楚可知：“雅各”是指属世真理的教义（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节），因而是指属世人里面的教义；“汤”是指这类教义事物的积聚。“熬汤”是指积聚在一起，因为在原文，这个动词严格来说，是用于“汤”（pottage）的名词，就好像你要说，他“汤汤”（pottaged pottage），也就是说，他将其积聚起来。良善与真理联结的第一个状态就是本节和下面几节，直到这一章末尾所描述的。<br />正在重生，或真理与良善正在他里面联结之人的第一个状态是：首先，真理的教义事物毫无秩序地积聚在他的属世人，或那里被称为记忆的仓库里面。那时，其中的教义事物好比某种原料的未消化粒子，没有与别的东西混合，只是积聚起来，并且好比一种混沌。但这种混沌的存在是为了它们能被整理成序，因为凡被整理成序的东西首先处于混沌状态。这就是雅各熬制，就是积聚的汤所表示的。这些教义事物不是凭自己，而凭流入它们里面的良善而被整理成序的；进入它们里面的良善的量和这良善作用于它们的本质就决定了它们的有序程度和其有序状态的性质。当良善首先渴望和想要这些教义事物，以便能与它们联结时，它以真理情感的形式显现。这就是以扫对雅各说“求你把这红的给我抿点”所表示的。<br />表面上看，这些事的确与字义相去甚远；然而当世人阅读这些话，并照字义来理解时，那时与他同在的天使根本没有汤、雅各、以扫、这红的、喝这红（汤）的观念。相反，他们具有属灵的观念，而属灵观念与属世观念完全不同，相去甚远。这些人和物的观念瞬间就转化为属灵观念。圣言中的其它事物也一样，例如：当有人读到饼时，天使意识不到饼，取而代之的是，他们立刻意识到属天之爱及其所属一切，也就是对主之爱；当有人在圣言中读到酒时，他们意识不到酒，取而代之的是属灵之爱及其所属一切，也就是对邻之爱。因此，当有人读到汤或羹时，他们意识不到汤或羹，而意识到尚未与良善联结的教义事物，因而意识到它们的无序积聚。这表明天使的思想观念的本质和特征，并且表明他们的思想观念距离世人的何等遥远。如果人在神圣状态下以同样的方式进行思考，如领圣餐的时候，看到饼想到的是对主之爱，看到酒想到的是对邻之爱，那么他的思想观念就与那时更接近他的天使相似，直到最后他们就有可能共享思想，不过，前提是，当时此人处在良善的状态。<br />“汤”或“羹”表示一团混沌，这一点也可从列王纪中关于先知门徒和以利沙的论述明显看出来：<br />以利沙又来到吉甲。那地正有饥荒，先知门徒坐在他面前，他对仆人说，你将大锅放在火上，给先知门徒熬汤。有一个人去到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜回来，切了搁在熬汤的锅中。因为他们不知道是什么东西，倒出来给众人吃。吃汤的时候，都喊叫说，神人啊，锅中有致死的毒物！他们就不能吃了。以利沙说，拿点面来。就把面撒在锅中说，给众人倒出来，他们就吃了，锅中就没有毒了。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下4.38.htm">4:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下4.41.htm">41</a>）<br />就内义而言，这些话所表示的事完全不同于它们在字义上所表示的。“那地的饥荒”表对良善与真理的认知的匮乏（<a href="1460.htm">1460</a>节）；“先知门徒”表那些教导的人（<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>节）；“汤”表记忆知识混成一团；“面”表来自良善的真理，或来自属天之物的属灵之物（<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节）。因此，“以利沙把面撒在锅中，锅中就没有毒了”表这一团混沌通过出于主圣言的属灵真理而得以纠正和改善；因为以利沙代表主的圣言（<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。若没有这种属灵之义，关于汤和它因面而发生变化的故事在最神圣的圣言中根本不值一提。这也是圣言中其它奇迹的情形，所有奇迹都隐藏着神性事物在里面，这种奇迹的发生是为了代表这些事物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3316</b></p><p><b>3316.</b>
And Jacob boiled pottage. That this signifies a chaotic mass of doctrinal things, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the doctrine of natural truth (n. 3305), thus the doctrinal things 
which are in the natural man; and from the signification of "pottage," as being a chaotic mass of such things. "Boiling it," signifies amassing, for in the original tongue the expression is proper 
to pottage, as if it had been said that he "pottaged pottage," that is, he amassed it. The first state of the conjunction of good and truth is that which is described in this and the following verses, 
down to the end of the chapter. [2] The first state of the man who is being regenerated, or in whom truth is being conjoined with good, is that first of all in his natural man, or in its storehouse 
called the memory, there are amassed the doctrinal things of truth without any certain order. The doctrinal things at that time therein may be compared to some undigested and uncompounded mass, and to 
a kind of chaos. But this is to the end that they may be reduced to order, for whatever is to be reduced to order is at first in this state of confusion; and this is what is signified by the pottage 
which Jacob boiled, that is, amassed. These doctrinal things are not reduced to order by themselves, but by the good which flows into them, and the good reduces them into order in exact proportion to 
the amount and the quality of its action upon them. When good first longs for and desires these doctrinal things, to the end that it may conjoin them with itself, it manifests itself under the appearance 
of the affection of truth. This is what is signified by Esau's saying to Jacob, "Cause me to sup I pray of the red, this red."  [3] These things do indeed appear remote from the sense of the letter; 
nevertheless, when these words are read by man, and are apprehended by him according to the sense of the letter, the angels who are then with him have no idea at all of pottage, or of Jacob, or of 
Esau, or of what is red, or of supping of what is red, but instead thereof they have a spiritual idea which is altogether different and remote from such natural ideas, and into this spiritual idea these 
natural things are instantly turned. It is the same with other things in the Word; as for example when man reads of bread, the angels have no perception of bread, but instantly instead of bread they 
perceive celestial love and all that belongs thereto, that is, to love to the Lord; and when wine is read of in the Word, they do not perceive wine, but instead of wine spiritual love and all that 
belongs thereto, that is, to love toward the neighbor. So when pottage or pulse is read of, they do not perceive pottage or pulse, but doctrinal things not yet conjoined with good, thus an inordinated 
mass of them. This shows the nature and quality of the angelic thought and perception, and how remote it is from the thought and perception of man. If man thought in like manner when he is in a holy 
state, as when he attends the Holy Supper, and instead of bread perceived love to the Lord, and instead of wine love toward the neighbor, he would be in thought and perception like that of the angels, 
who would then approach nearer to him, till at last they could consociate their thoughts, but only so far as the man was at the same time in good. [4] That "pottage" or "pulse" signifies a chaotic 
mass, is evident also from what is said in the book of Kings concerning the sons of the prophets and Elisha: </p>
<p>     Elisha came back to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets 
were sitting before him; and he said to his lad, Set on the great pot and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets; and one went out into the field to gather herbs, and he found a vine of the 
field and gathered from it gourds of the field his garment full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage, because they knew not; and they poured out to the men to eat; and it came to pass, in 
their eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, O man of God there is death in the pot! And they could not eat; and he said, Take ye meal; and he put it into the pot, and said, Pour out for 
the people; and they did eat, and there was no evil word in the pot (2 Kings 4:38-41). In the internal sense these words signify things altogether different from that which they signify in the sense 
of the letter. A "famine in the land" signifies a scarcity of the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1460); the "sons of the prophets" signify those who teach (n. 2534); "pottage" signifies an ill-assorted 
mass of memory-knowledges; and "meal," the truth which is from good, or the spiritual which is from the celestial (n. 2177); thus that Elisha put meal in the pot, and there was then no evil in it, 
signifies that that chaotic mass was amended by means of spiritual truth from the Lord's Word; for Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word (n. 2762). Apart from this spiritual sense, this story 
concerning the pottage and the change in it by the meal, would not have been worthy of relation in the most holy Word. It was for the sake of the representation of such things that this miracle was wrought, 
as also is the case with the rest of the miracles in the Word, all of which have Divine things concealed within them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3316</b></p><p><b>3316.</b>
'Jacob boiled pottage' means matters of doctrine when massed together. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the doctrine of natural truth, dealt with in <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, and so as matters of doctrine 
within the natural man, and from the meaning of 'pottage' as a massing together of such matters of doctrine. Indeed 'boiling pottage' is massing together; for the verb in the original language is 
strictly speaking the noun for 'pottage' - as if you were to say 'he pottaged pottage', that is, he massed it together. It is the first state in the joining together of good and truth that is described 
in this verse and in those that follow to the end of the chapter. The first state of one who is being regenerated - that is, with whom truth is being joined to good - is a state in which first of all 
matters of doctrine regarding what is true are massed together, without any definite order, in his natural man, that is, in the storehouse there called the memory. The matters of doctrine present there 
at that time may be compared to the undigested particles of some ingredient, not compounded with anything else but massed together, and may be compared to a kind of chaos. But the chaos exists to 
the end that they may be brought into an ordered condition; for with anything that is brought into an ordered condition chaos exists at first. This is what is meant by the pottage that Jacob boiled, 
that is, massed together. Those matters of doctrine are not brought into an ordered condition by anything within themselves but by the good that must enter into them; and the amount of good entering into 
them, also the essential nature of that good, determine how far they become ordered and the nature of their then ordered condition. When good first craves and desires matters of doctrine, to the end 
that they may be joined to itself, it is seen in the form of an affection for truth. These are the considerations meant by 'Esau said to Jacob, Let me sip now from the red [pottage], this red [pottage]'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Such considerations do indeed appear to be quite remote from the sense of the letter, but nevertheless when man reads these words and understands them according to the sense of the letter, 
the angels who reside with him at the time do not have any [natural] idea at all of pottage, or of Jacob, or of Esau, or of red, or of sipping from red [pottage]. Instead they have a spiritual idea 
of them, which is altogether different and remote from that natural idea. The idea of those persons and objects is instantly converted into a spiritual idea. And so it is with everything else in the 
Word, such as, for example, when one reads of bread there the angels do not perceive bread but instead of bread instantly perceive celestial love and things that belong to celestial love, which is love 
to the Lord. And when one reads in the Word of wine they do not perceive wine but instead of wine spiritual love and the things that belong to that love, which is love towards the neighbour. Accordingly 
when one reads of pottage or soup they do not perceive pottage or soup but matters of doctrine that are not as yet joined to good, and thus a disordered massing together of them. This shows the essence 
and character of angels' thought and perception, and how remote these are from man's thought and perception. If a person when in a holy frame of mind were to think as they do - such as during the 
Holy Supper - and instead of bread were to perceive love to the Lord, and instead of wine love towards the neighbour, his thought and perception would then be similar to the angels' who in that case 
would draw nearer to him till at length it would be possible for them to share their thoughts with him, though only insofar as good was at the same time present in that person. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'pottage' 
or soup means a massing together may be seen also from what is said about the sons of the prophets and Elisha in the Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Elisha came again to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. 
And the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. And one of them went out into the field to gather 
herbs and found a wild vine, and gathered from it wild gourds his lap full, and came and cut them up into the pot of pottage, for they did not know [what they were]. And they poured out for the men 
to eat. And it happened, while they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, There is death in the pot, O man of God! And they could not eat it. And he said, Then bring flour. And he 
threw it into the pot, and said, Pour out for the people. And they ate, and there was no harm in the pot. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 4:38-41. </p>
<p>In the internal sense these words have an altogether different meaning from 
what they do in the sense of the letter, that is to say, 'a famine in the land' means a dearth of cognitions of good and truth, <a href="1460.htm">1460</a>; 'the sons of the prophets' means those who teach, <a href="2543.htm">2543</a>; 'pottage' 
facts badly massed together; 'flour' truth which is obtained from good, or that which is spiritual obtained from that which is celestial, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>. Thus the description of Elisha throwing the flour into 
the pot, at which point it ceased to contain anything harmful, means that those facts, massed together so, were put right by means of spiritual truth from the Lord's Word - for 'Elisha' represented the 
Lord as to the Word, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. Devoid of this spiritual sense the story about the pottage and the change effected by the flour would not have been worthy of mention in the most holy Word. As with the rest 
of the miracles in the Word, all of which conceal what is Divine within them, this miracle was performed for the sake of representing those things. </p>

`Coxit Jacob pultem':  quod significet doctrinalium congeriem, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit doctrina veri naturalis, de qua n. 3305, ita doctrinalia quae in naturali homine; et ex significatione 
`pultis' quod sit congeries talium; et `coquere illam' est congerere, in lingua enim originali est vox propria pultis, quasi diceres `pultavit pultem,' hoc est, congessit. Est primus status 
conjunctionis boni et veri qui in hoc versu et in sequentibus hujus capitis ad finem describitur. Primus status hominis qui regeneratur, {1}seu apud quem bono conjungitur verum, est quod omnium primo 
in (t)ejus naturali homine, seu in hujus reconditorio quod memoria vocatur, congerantur doctrinalia veri, absque certo ordine; doctrinalia quae ibi tunc sunt, comparari possunt alicui congeriei indigestae 
et incompositae, et quasi cuidam chao; at hoc ob finem ut in ordinem redigantur, nam quicquid redigetur in ordinem, principio tale est; hoc est quod significatur per `pultem, quam Jacobus coxit,' 
hoc est, congessit: illa in ordinem a se non rediguntur, sed a bono quod in illa influet, et quantum et qualiter bonum agit in illa, tantum et taliter in ordinem illa redigit; bonum cum primum appetit 
illa et desiderat, ob finem conjungendi sibi illa, apparet sub specie affectionis veri; haec sunt quae significantur per quod `Esau dixit ad Jacobum, Fac mihi sorbere quaeso e rubro, rubrum hoc.' 
[2] Remotiora quidem haec apparent a sensu litterae, sed usque cum haec leguntur ab homine et secundum sensum litterae ab illo capiuntur, angeli qui tunc apud eum, prorsus nullam ideam pultis, nec Jacobi, 
nec Esavi, nec rubri, nec sorbere e rubro, habent, sed loco illorum habent ideam spiritualem, quae prorsus alia est, et remota a naturali illa; in eam ideam, nempe in spiritualem, momento vertuntur 
illa; ita quoque se habet cum reliquis in Verbo; ut pro exemplo, cum ibi legitur `panis,' angeli non percipiunt panem, sed momento pro pane percipiunt amorem caelestem et quae amoris caelestis sunt, 
hoc est, amoris in Dominum; cumque in Verbo legitur `vinum,' non percipiunt vinum, sed pro vino amorem spiritualem et quae amoris illius sunt, hoc est, amoris erga proximum; ita cum legitur `puls 
seu pulmentum,' non percipiunt pultem seu pulmentum, sed doctrinalia nondum conjuncta bono, ita inordinatum eorum congeriem: inde constare potest quae et qualis cogitatio et perceptio angelorum est, et 
quam remota illa est a cogitatione et perceptione hominis; si homo similiter cogitaret dum in sancto est, {2}ut dum in Sancta Cena, et pro pane perciperet amorem in Dominum, et pro vino amorem erga 
proximum, tunc in simili cogitatione et perceptione foret cum angelis, qui tunc propius ad {3}illum accederent, usque tandem ut {4}consociare possent cogitationes, sed quantum homo simul in bono foret. 
[3] Quod `puls seu pulmentum' significet congeriem, etiam constare potest ex illis quae de filiis prophetarum et Elisaeo dicuntur, in Libro Regum,           Elisaeus rediit Gilgalem, et fames in terra, 
et filii      prophetarum sedentes coram illo; et dixit puero suo, Appone      ollam magnam, et coque pultem filiis prophetarum: et exivit      unus in agrum ad colligendum olera, et invenit vitem 
agri, et      collegit ex illa {5}colocynthidas agri plenitudinem vestis      suae, et venit et concidit in ollam pultis, quia non noverunt,      et effuderunt viris ad comedendum, et factum, 
in comedendo eos      de pulte, et illi clamabant, et dicebant, Mors in olla, vir      Dei; et non potuerunt edere; et dixit, Et accipite farinam; et      misit in ollam, et dixit, Effunde populo; 
et comederunt, et      non fuit verbum malum in olla, 2 Reg. iv 38-41; </p>
<p>haec in sensu interno prorsus alia significavit quam in sensu litterae, nempe `fames in terra' penuriam cognitionum boni et veri, 
n. 1460, `filii prophetarum' docentes, n. 2534, `puls' congeriem ex scientificis male confarctam, `farina' verum quod ex bono, seu spirituale quod ex caelesti, n. 2177, ita quod `Elisaeus miserit farinam 
in ollam, et tunc non fuerit malum in illa' significat quod congeries illa emendata sit per verum spirituale ex Verbo Domini; `Elisaeus' enim repraesentabat Dominum quoad Verbum, n. 2762; absque 
spirituali hoc sensu narratio de pulte, et mutatio per farinam, non fuisset digna memoratu in Verbo sanctissimo; repraesentationis {6}illorum causa factum est hoc miraculum, sicut etiam reliqua miracula 
in Verbo, quae omnia in se recondunt Divina.{7} @1 est talis$  @2 ut in sacra coena$  @3 ipsum$  @4 consociari$  @5 so Sch; AI have colycinthidas$  @6 horum$  @7 i quae repraesentant$  </p>
