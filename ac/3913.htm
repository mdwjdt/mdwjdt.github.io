<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3913节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3913.</strong>“拉结说，看哪，我的使女辟拉”表属世真理与内在真理之间的肯定方法。这从“使女”（maidservant）和“婢女”（handmaid）的含义，以及“辟拉”的代表清楚可知，“使女”（maidservant）和“婢女”（handmaid）是指对属于外层人（exterior man）的认知的情感（<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>，<a href="3835.htm">3835</a>，<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>节），由于这种情感是用来联结内在真理与属世或外在真理的方法，故“使女”在此表示它们之间的肯定方法；“辟拉”是指该方法的性质。就内义而言，拉结和利亚为生育后代而送给雅各作妾的这两个使女无非代表并表示某种服务的事物，在此代表并表示充当联结内在真理与外在真理手段的某种事物，“拉结”代表内在真理，“利亚”代表外在真理（<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。事实上，此处雅各的十二个儿子描述了十二种总体或基本事物，人在重生或变成教会期间，便通过这些事物被引入属灵和属天之物。<br />实际上，当人正在重生，或变成教会，即从死人变成活人，或从属肉体的变成属天堂的时，他会在主的引领下经历许多种状态。这些总体状态由“十二个儿子”，后来由“十二个支派”来指定。因此，“十二个支派”表示信与爱的全部事物，如前文所见（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>节）。因为总体包含一切具体和个体细节，而细节都与总体有关。当人正在重生时，内在人要与外在人联结，故内在的良善与真理要与外在人的良善与真理联结，因为人凭真理与良善而为人。若没有方法，这些不可能联结在一起。这些方法就是诸如从这一方获得某种事物，又从那一方获得某种事物的那类事物，并且具有这样的效果：人越靠近这一方，那一方就越处于从属地位。这些方法就是“使女”所表示的，拉结的使女是指内在人那一方的方法，而利亚的使女是指外在人那一方的方法。<br />结合须有方法，这一点可从以下事实看出来：属世人凭自己压根就不赞成属灵人，而是与属灵人如此不合，以至于完全反对它。因为属世人关注并热爱自我和尘世，而属灵人则不关注自我和尘世，除非有助于在灵界发挥功用，因而他关注它的服务并出于功用和目的而热爱它。当地位高升，从而高人一等时，属世人便觉得自己有了生命；而属灵人在谦卑，因而在成为最小的时才觉得自己有了生命。只要高位作为方法能使他服务邻舍、整个社会和教会，他也不会鄙视高位。然而，属灵人思想他所晋升的重要地位，不是为了他自己，而是为了他作为目的所关注的功用。属世人的幸福在于比别人更富有，拥有世俗的财富；而属灵人的幸福在于拥有真理与良善的认知，这些真理与良善便是他所拥有的财富，尤其在于照着真理实践良善。然而，他并不鄙视财富，因为财富能使他在世上提供服务。<br />从这几点考虑明显可知，属世人的状态和属灵人的状态因其目的不同而彼此对立，但这二者仍能彼此结合。当外在人的事物处于从属地位，并服从内在人所关注的目的时，这种结合就会产生。因此，为了人能变得属灵，外在人的事物有必要变得顺服，从而脱去支持自我和尘世的目的，披上支持邻舍和主国度的目的。若不通过方法，绝无可能脱去前者，披上后者，这二者也无法联结。这些方法就是“使女”，特别是使女所生的四个儿子所表示的。<br />第一个方法就是肯定内在真理，或对内在真理的肯定的方法；也就是说，肯定这的确是内在真理。这种肯定态度一旦到来，人便处于重生的开始阶段；良善从内在起作用，并通向肯定的灵。这良善无法流入否定态度，甚至无法充满怀疑的态度，直到这态度变得肯定。在此之后，这良善便显现在情感中；也就是说，它使此人感受到对真理的一种情感，并开始以之为乐，先是以认识这真理为乐，然后以照之行动为乐。以这一真理为例，即：主是人类的救赎。如果此人不针对该真理发展肯定的态度，那么他从圣言或教会所学习，并储存在其属世记忆的记忆知识当中有关主的一切事物就无法与他的内在人，也就是那里能成为信之真理的真理结合。因此，情感也无法流入，甚至无法流入这有助于此人救赎的真理总体上的方方面面。但是，一旦他发展一种肯定的态度，那么无数事物就会加添，并充满所流入的良善。因为良善不断从主流入，但那里若没有肯定态度，它就不被接受。故肯定态度是第一个方法，可以说是从主所流入良善的第一个居所。所有其它被称为信之真理的真理也是如此。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3913</b></p><p><b>3913.</b>
And she said, Behold my maidservant Bilhah. That this signifies the affirming means which there is between natural truth and interior truth, is evident from the signification of a "maidservant" and also 
of a "handmaid" as being the affection of the knowledges that belong to the exterior man (n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849); and because this affection is the means for conjoining interior truths with natural 
or external truths, by "handmaid" is here signified the affirming means between them: and from the representation of Bilhah, as being the quality of this means. By the handmaids given to Jacob by 
Rachel and Leah for women to the intent that they might bring forth offspring, nothing else was represented and signified in the internal sense, than such a thing as is of service; here, for a means 
of the conjunction of interior truth with external truth; for by Rachel is represented interior truth, and by Leah external truth (n. 3793, 3819). For by the twelve sons of Jacob are here described the 
twelve general or cardinal things by means of which while being regenerated or made a church, man is initiated into what is spiritual and celestial. For when a man is being regenerated, or made a church 
(that is, when from a dead man he is becoming alive, or from corporeal heavenly), he is led by the Lord through many states. These general states are what are designated by the "twelve sons," and 
afterwards by the "twelve tribes;" for which reason the "twelve tribes" signify all things of faith and love, as may be seen above (n. 3858); for generals involve all the particulars and singulars, 
and these latter bear relation to the former. [2] When a man is being regenerated, the internal man is to be conjoined with the external, consequently the goods and truths of the internal man with the 
goods and truths of the external; for from truths and goods man is man. These cannot be conjoined without means. Means are such things as derive something from the one side, and something from the other, 
and which are attended with the effect that insofar as the man accedes to the one, the other becomes subordinate. These means are what are signified by the "handmaids," the means on the part of 
the internal man by the handmaids of Rachel; and the means on the part of the external man by the handmaids of Leah. [3] That there must be means of conjunction may be seen from the fact that of itself 
the natural man does not in the least agree with the spiritual man, but disagrees so far as to be altogether opposite. For the natural man regards and loves himself and the world; but the spiritual 
man does not regard himself and the world, except insofar as is conducive to the promotion of uses in the spiritual world; and thus regards its service and loves it from the use and end. The natural 
man seems to himself to have life when he is elevated to dignities, and thus to supereminence over others; but the spiritual man seems to himself to have life in humility, and in being the least.  Nor 
does he disregard dignities, provided that by them as means he can be of service to his neighbor, to the community, and to the church. Yet he does not reflect for the sake of himself upon the dignities 
to which he is elevated, but for the sake of the uses which he regards as the ends. The natural man is in his bliss when he is richer than others, and possesses the world's wealth; but the spiritual 
man is in his bliss when he is in the knowledges of truth and good, which are his riches; and still more when he is in the practice of good according to truths; and yet he does not despise riches, 
because by means of them he can be in that practice, and in the world. [4] From these few considerations it is evident that the state of the natural man and that of the spiritual man are opposed to each 
other by their ends; but that nevertheless they can be conjoined, which takes place when the things of the external man are made subordinate and subservient to the ends of the internal man. In order 
therefore that a man may become spiritual, it is necessary for the things of the external man to be reduced to compliance; thus that the ends in favor of self and the world be put off; and ends in 
favor of the neighbor and the Lord's kingdom be put on. The former can by no means be put off and the latter put on, and thus the two be conjoined, except through means. These means are what are signified 
by the "handmaids," and in particular by the "four sons" born of the handmaids. [5] The first means is one that affirms or is affirmative of internal truth-that it is so. When this affirmative comes, 
the man is in the beginning of regeneration; good is being worked by the internal, and causes the affirmation. This good cannot inflow into what is negative, nor even into what is full of doubt, 
until this becomes affirmative. But afterwards it manifests itself by affection, that is, by the man's being affected with truth, or beginning to be delighted with it; first in knowing it, and then in 
acting according to it. Take, for example, the truth that the Lord is the salvation for the human race. Unless this is made affirmative by the man, all the things he has learned from the Word or in 
the church concerning the Lord, and that are in his natural memory among the memory- knowledges, cannot be conjoined with his internal man, that is, with what can be there of faith. Thus neither can affection 
flow in, not even into the generals of that truth which are conducive to man's salvation. But when it becomes affirmative, innumerable things are added, and are filled with the good that flows 
in; for good continually flows in from the Lord, but where there is no affirmative, it is not received. An affirmative is therefore the first means, and is as it were the first abode of the good that 
flows in from the Lord. The same is the case with all the other truths that are called truths of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3913</b></p><p><b>3913.</b>
'She said, Behold, my maidservant Bilhah' means the affirming means, which has its place between natural truth and interior truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a maidservant', and also of 'a servant-girl' 
as the affection for the cognitions which belong to the exterior man, dealt with in <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>, <a href="3835.htm">3835</a>, <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>, and in this particular case since that affection is the means by which interior 
truths become joined to natural or external truths, 'a maidservant' therefore describes the affirming means that has its place between these; and from the representation of 'Bilhah' as the nature of that 
means. The two servant-girls which Rachel and Leah gave to Jacob as wives for producing offspring represented and meant in the internal sense nothing else than something which is of service, in this 
case something serving as the means by which those two things are joined together, namely interior truth with external truth, for 'Rachel' represents interior truth, 'Leah' external, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. Indeed 
by means of the twelve sons of Jacob twelve general or principal requisites are described here by which a person is introduced into spiritual and celestial things while he is being regenerated or 
becoming the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Actually when a person is being regenerated or becoming the Church, that is, when from being a dead man he is becoming a living one, or from being a bodily- minded man is 
becoming a heavenly-minded one, he is led by the Lord through many states. These general states are specified by those twelve sons, and later by the twelve tribes, so that the twelve tribes mean all aspects 
of faith and love - see what has been shown in <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>. For any general whole includes every particular and individual detail, and each detail exists in relation to the general whole. When a person 
is being regenerated the internal man is to be joined to the external man, and therefore the goods and truths which belong to the internal man are to be joined to those which belong to the external 
man, for it is truths and goods that make a person a human being. These cannot be joined together without means. These means consist in such things as take something from one side and something from the 
other, and act in such a way that insofar as a person moves closer to one the other plays a subordinate role. These means are meant by the servant-girls - Rachel's servant-girls being the means available 
from the internal man, Leah's the means available from the external man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The necessity for means by which the joining together is effected may be recognized from the consideration that of 
himself the natural man does not agree at all with the spiritual but disagrees so much as to be utterly opposed to the spiritual. For the natural man regards and loves self and the world, whereas the 
spiritual man does not, except insofar as to do so leads to the rendering of services in the spiritual world, and so he regards service to it and loves this service because of the use that is served 
and the end in view. The natural man seems to himself to have life when he is promoted to high positions and so to pre-eminence over others, but the spiritual man seems to himself to have life in self-abasement 
and in being the least. Not that he despises high positions, provided they are means by which he is enabled to serve the neighbour, society as a whole, and the Church. Neither does the spiritual 
man view the important positions to which he is promoted in any selfish way but on account of the services rendered which are his ends in view. Bliss for the natural man consists in his being wealthier 
than others and in his possessing worldly riches, whereas bliss for the spiritual man consists in his having cognitions of truth and good which are the riches he possesses, and even more so in 
the practice of good in accordance with truths. Not however that he despises riches, because these enable him to render a service in the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These few considerations show that on account of 
their different ends in view the state of the natural man and the state of the spiritual are the reverse of each other, but that the two can be joined one to the other. That conjunction is effected 
when things which belong to the external man become subordinate and are subservient to the ends which the internal man has in view. In order that a person may become spiritual therefore it is necessary 
for the things belonging to the external man to be brought into a position of subservience, and so for ends that have self and the world in view to be cast aside and those that have the neighbour and 
the Lord's kingdom to be adopted. The former cannot possibly be cast aside or the latter adopted, and so the two cannot be joined, except through means. It is these means that are meant by the servant-girls, 
and specifically by the four sons born to the servant-girls. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The first means is one that affirms, or is affirmative towards, internal truth; that is to say, it affirms that it really 
is internal truth. Once this affirmative attitude is present, a person is in the first stage of regeneration, good from within being at work and leading to that spirit of affirmation. That good cannot 
pass into a negative attitude, nor even into one of doubt, until this becomes affirmative. After this, that good manifests itself in affection; that is to say, it causes the person to feel an affection 
for, and delight in, truth - first through his coming to know this truth, then through his acting in accordance with it. Take for example the truth that the Lord is the human race's salvation. If the 
person does not develop an affirmative attitude towards this truth, none of the things which he has learned about the Lord from the Word or in the Church and which are included among the facts in his 
natural memory can be joined to his internal man, that is, to the truths that are able to be truths of faith there. Nor can affection accordingly enter in, not even into the general aspects of this 
truth which contribute to the person's salvation. But once he develops an affirmative attitude countless things are added and are filled with the good that is flowing in. For good is flowing in constantly 
from the Lord, but where no affirmative attitude exists it is not accepted. An affirmative attitude is therefore the first means and so to speak first dwelling-place of the good flowing in from 
the Lord. And the same is so with all other truths called the truths of faith. </p>

Dixit, Ecce famula mea Bilhah': quod significet medium affirmans quod inter naturale verum (c)et interius verum, constat (c)ex significatione `famulae' tum ancillae, quod sit affectio cognitionum 
quae sunt exterioris hominis, de qua n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849, et quia affectio illa est medium conjungendi vera interiora eum veris naturalibus seu externis, ideo hic per `famulam' significatur 
medium affirmans inter illa; et ex repraesentatione `Bilhae' quod sit quale illius medii.  Per ancillas datas Jacobo a Rachele et Leah in mulieres ut procrearent sobolem, nihil aliud in sensu interno 
repraesentatum et significatum est quam tale quod inservit, hic pro medio conjunctionis, nempe interioris veri verum externo; per `Rachelem' enim repraesentatur interius verum, per `Leam' externum, 
n. 3793, 3819: agitur enim hic per duodecim filios Jacobi de duodecim communibus seu cardinalibus rebus per quas initiatur homo in spiritualia et caelestia dum regeneratur seu dum fit Ecclesia; 
[2] homo enim cum regeneratur seu fit Ecclesia, hoc est, cum fit a mortuo {1}homine vivus seu {2}a corporeo caelestis, per plures status a Domino ducitur; communes {3}status sunt qui designantur per 
duodecim illos filios, et dein per duodecim tribus, quapropter `duodecim tribus' significant omnia fidei et amoris, ut n. 3858 ostensum videatur; communia enim involvunt omnia particularia et singularia, 
et haec se referunt ad illa.  Cum homo regeneratur, tunc internus homo conjungendus est cum externo, proinde (t)bona et vera quae sunt interni hominis cum (t)bonis et veris quae sunt externi, 
ex veris et bonis enim homo est homo; illa non conjungi possunt absque mediis; media sunt talia quae aliquid trahunt ab una parte et aliquid ab altera, et quae faciunt ut quantum homo accedit ad 
unam, tantum subordinetur altera; haec media sunt quae significantur per `ancillas,' media a parte interni hominis per `ancillas Rachelis,' {4}et media a parte externi hominis per `ancillas Leae.' 
 [3] Quod media conjunctionis erunt, constare potest ex eo quod naturalis homo ex se prorsus non concordet cum spirituali, sed quod in tantum discordet, ut prorsus ei oppositus sit; naturalis enim 
homo spectat et amat se et mundum, spiritualis autem non spectat {5}se et mundum nisi quantum conducit ad promovendos usus in spirituali mundo, ita servitium ejus spectat et id amat ex usu et fine; 
naturalis homo tunc vitam habere sibi videtur, cum ad dignitates evehitur, ita ad supereminentiam super alios, at spiritualis homo vitam habere sibi videtur in humiliatione et quod minimus sit; 
nec dignitates spernit, modo per illas ut per media inservire possit proximo, societati communi, et Ecclesiae, et non reflectit super dignitates ad quas evehitur, propter se, sed propter illos usus 
qui ei fines sunt; naturalis homo in sua beatitudine est cum prae aliis opulentus {6}est ac mundi opes possidet, at spiritualis homo in sua beatitudine est cum in cognitionibus veri et boni, quae 
sunt ei opulentia, et magis cum in exercitio boni secundum vera est; nec tamen spernit opulentiam, quia per illam in exercitio potest esse et in mundo; [4] ex his paucis constare potest quod status 
naturalis hominis et spiritualis sint sibi oppositi per fines, (m)sed quod usque conjungi possint; </p>
<p>quod fit cum illa quae sunt externi hominis subordinata sunt et inserviunt finibus interni(n); 
ideo ut homo fiat spiritualis, necessum est ut {7}illa quae sunt externi hominis ad obsequium redigantur, ita exuendi sunt fines pro se et mundo ac induendi fines pro proximo et pro regno Domini; illa 
exui et haec indui nequaquam possunt, ita non conjungi, nisi per media; haec media sunt quae significantur per `ancillas,' et {8}in specie per quatuor filios ab ancillis natos: [5] primum medium 
est affirmans seu affirmativum veri interni, nempe quod ita sit; cum affirmativum fit, tunc homo est in principio regenerationis, bonum {9}ab interno operatur, et facit affirmationem; bonum illud 
non potest influere in negativum, ne quidem in dubitativum, antequam hoc affirmativum fit; id bonum dein se manifestat per affectionem, nempe per id quod homo afficiatur vero, seu incipiat delectari 
illo, primum quod sciat id, dein quod secundum id agat; ut pro exemplo, quod Dominus sit salus generi humano; nisi hoc fiat affirmativum ab homine, non possunt omnia illa quae de Domino ex Verbo 
aut in Ecclesia didicit, et in naturalis {10}ejus memoria inter scientifica sunt, conjungi cum interno ejus homine, {11}hoc est, cum illis quae ibi, possunt esse fidei, ita nec potest affectio influere, 
ne quidem in communia illius rei quae ad salutem hominis conducunt; at cum affirmativum fit, tunc innumerabilia accedunt, et implentur bono quod influit; </p>
<p>nam bonum continue (t)influit a Domino, 
sed ubi non est affirmativum, non recipitur: est itaque affirmativum primum medium, et quasi primum habitaculum boni influentis a Domino: similiter se habet cum omnibus reliquis quae fidei vocantur. @1
