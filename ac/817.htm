<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第817节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>817.</strong>有人从左边地狱的一个房间过来跟我说话。我得以发觉他属于恶棍之流。他在世时的所作所为以下述方式被揭露出来：他被发送到稍微深的低地，在前面靠左一点，在那里开始挖墓穴，如同为埋葬死人所行的那样。这不禁使我怀疑他在肉身生活期间曾犯有谋杀行为。就在这时，一具披盖黑布的棺材出现了。随后不久，一个人从棺材里起身向我走来。他诚恳地告诉我说，他已经死了，他认为是那个人毒死了他，他临死的时候就是这么想的，但他不知道这样怀疑有没有道理。闻听此言，这个可恶的精灵（灵）承认他做过这种事。忏悔过后随之而来的是惩罚。他在自己所挖的黑暗墓穴中滚了两次，变得黑如埃及木乃伊。在这种状态下，他被抬到高处，并被带到精灵（灵）和天使眼前，只听见有喊声说：“真是个魔鬼！”他还渐渐变冷，就象那些冰冷的地狱灵一样，然后被送入地狱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]817.</strong> A certain spirit from a room in hell that was off to the left side came to me and talked with me. I was allowed to perceive that he was a criminal type.<br />This is how his misdeeds in the world were exposed: he was sent fairly far down into the underground realm that was in front and a little to the left, and there he began to dig a hole, as people do for burying the dead. This made me suspect that he had committed some fatal deed during bodily life. Next there appeared a bier swathed in black, and soon a man rose off it and approached me. He told me with saintly restraint that he was dead, probably as a result of poisoning by that man. This had been his dying thought, although he did not know whether it was an unfounded suspicion.{*1} When the wicked spirit heard this, he confessed that he had done the deed. Punishment followed his confession. Twice he was rolled into the black grave he had dug and became as black himself in face and body as Egyptian mummies. In this condition, he was lifted up high and carried around in front of spirits and angels, while people shouted, "What a devil!" He also turned cold, so that he belongs among the cold in hell; and he was sent to hell.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a more detailed version of this same story, see Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_817/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1260" target=_top>1260</a>.

There came one to me out of an infernal apartment at the left side and spoke with me. It was given me to perceive that he was of a villainous crew. What he had done in the world was disclosed in the 
following manner. He was sent down somewhat deep into the lower earth, in front, a little to the left, and there he began to dig a grave, as is done for the dead who are to be buried. From this arose 
a suspicion that in the life of the body he had perpetrated some deadly deed. Then there appeared a funeral bier covered with a black cloth. Presently one rising from the bier came to me, and in a devout 
manner related that he had died, and that he believed he had been killed by that man with poison, and that he had thought so at the hour of his death, but did not know whether it was more than a suspicion. 
When the infamous spirit heard this, he confessed that he had committed such a deed. After the confession, punishment followed. He was twice rolled about in the dark hole he had dug, and became 
as black as an Egyptian mummy, both face and body, and in that state was taken up on high and carried about before spirits and angels, and the cry was heard: What a devil! He also became cold, thus 
one of the cold infernals, and was sent down into hell. </p>

Somebody from one of the vaults of hell over on the left hand side came and spoke to me. I was given to perceive that he belonged among villains. What he had perpetrated in the world was brought to light 
as follows: He was sent down quite some way into the lower earth, to a forward position a little to the left, and there he began to dig a grave as people do for the dead who are to be buried. This 
gave rise to a suspicion that during his lifetime he had been responsible for some act of murder. A bier draped with a black cloth appeared at that point. Soon afterwards someone rose out of the bier 
and came to me. He duly told me that he had died, and he assumed that that man had murdered him by poisoning, and that he had thought so around the time of his death though he did not know whether there 
were grounds for that suspicion. On hearing this that detestable spirit confessed that he had committed such a deed. Confession was followed by punishment. He was rolled around twice in the dark 
grave he had dug, and emerged looking black as an Egyptian mummy, in face and body. In that condition he was raised aloft and carried around before the eyes of spirits and angels, with the shout, 'What 
a devil!' He also turned cold, like those spirits in hell who are cold, and was sent to hell. </p>

</p><b>817.</b>
Quidam e camera infernali, quae ad latus sinistrum, ad me venit, et mecum locutus; percipere dabatur quod inter facinorosos: quod patravit in mundo, ita detegebatur; in inferiorem terram, anterius paulo 
ad sinistrum, satis profunde demissus est, et ibi scrobem coepit ejicere, tanquam ii qui pro mortuis qui sepeliendi; inde suborta suspicio, quod aliquid lethale in vita corporis patraverit; tunc 
apparuit feralis lectica, nigris pannis circumtecta; mox unus ex lectica surgens ad me venit, narravit pie quod mortuus sit, arbitratus quod veneno ab eo necatus, et quod id circa mortis horam cogitaverit, 
nesciens tamen an suspicio esset: cum nefandus spiritus id audivit, confessus est quod tale commisit; post confessionem punitio sequebatur; bis involvebatur atrae scrobi quam effodit, et factus 
niger sicut Aegyptiorum mumia, tam facie quam corpore, et sic evectus in altum circumlatus coram spiritibus et angelis, et clamatum, 'Qualis diabolus'; frigidus quoque factus, sic inter infernales frigidos, 
et missus in infernum. </p>
