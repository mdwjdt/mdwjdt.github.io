<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8941节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8941.</strong>“不可用凿过的石头建它”表它绝不是自我聪明的产物。这从“凿过的石头”的含义清楚可知，“凿过的石头”是指诸如出于自我聪明的那类事物，因为“石头”是指真理（参看<a href="8940.htm">8940</a>节）；凿刻或塑造它们表示产生或孵化真理，或更确切地说，看似真理、出于自我，也就是出于自我聪明的那类观念。因为凡由自我或自我聪明所产生或孵化的东西都从人那里获得自己的生命，这种生命根本不是生命，因为人的自我无非是邪恶（<a href="210.htm">210</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>，<a href="987.htm">987</a>，<a href="1047.htm">1047</a>，<a href="5660.htm">5660</a>，<a href="5786.htm">5786</a>，<a href="8480.htm">8480</a>节）；而不是从自我，而是从神那里所获得的东西则拥有生命在自己里面，因为一切生命皆来自神，或说神是一切生命的源头。此处论述的主题是源于真理的对主的敬拜，因为“石坛”表示这种敬拜（<a href="8940.htm">8940</a>节）。<br />激发对主的敬拜的真理唯独取自圣言，因为圣言的一切细节都有来自神的生命在里面。当真理取自人的自我时，它们以凌驾于世界上所有人之上的等级和显赫，以及超越所有人的世俗财物和财富为关注的目的。因此，它们含有对自我和世界的爱在里面，因而含有整体上的一切邪恶（<a href="7488.htm">7488</a>，<a href="8318.htm">8318</a>节）。但源于圣言的真理以永生为关注的目的，含有对主之爱和对邻之爱在里面，因而含有整体上的一切良善。当真理从自我或自我聪明产生或孵化出来时，它们就是管辖来自神的真理的主人，因为它们利用后者确认或强化自己。但情况应该反过来，也就是说，来自神的真理当掌权成为主人，而来自自我聪明的真理当成为仆人。自我或自我聪明的产物虽名为真理，其实并不是真理；它们只是外表看似真理，因为它们通过利用圣言的字义和推理而被造得看似真理；内在其实是虚假。至于这些事物是什么，是何性质，可参看前文（<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>节）。<br />世上有两种出于自我聪明的宗教表象。一种是对自我和世界的爱在其中是一切的宗教表象；在圣言中，这种宗教表象被称为“巴别塔”（Babel）。它内在由于对自我和世界的爱而是亵渎的，而外在则由于圣言而是神圣的，人们利用圣言来强化或确认自己的观念。另一种是自然之光在其中是一切的宗教表象；具有这种宗教的人不承认他们所不理解的任何东西为真理。一些属于这种表面宗教的人承认圣言，然而却利用它来强化或确认自己的观念，因而对待圣言如自己的奴仆。然而，有些人则不承认圣言；相反，他们认为神性在于自然界；事实上，他们在其中观看的光，是自然界的光，只在自然界里面闪光，无法被天堂之光光照，变得更加明亮，因为他们抛弃圣言，而圣言是一切光照的源头。那些属于这两种宗教表象的人则在地狱，因为他们缺乏天上的生命；他们之所以不能接受天上的生命，是因为他们已经将圣言抛在一边。他们当中那些已经利用圣言来强化或确认自己观念的人，从心里认为圣言一文不值；但鉴于它在普遍民众当中具有大权威、大权柄，所以他们以这种方式利用它来为自己服务，好叫他们自己的聪明所孵化的虚假观念能由此得以验证、强化。由此可见“不可用凿过的石头建坛”在灵义上表示什么。<br />在以下经文中，“凿过的石头”也表示出于自我聪明的东西：<br />这众百姓，就是以法莲和撒马利亚的居民，都要知道，他们凭骄傲自大的心说：砖墙塌了，我们却要用凿过的石头建筑。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.9.htm">9:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.10.htm">10</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />我哀哭呼求；祂使我的祷告不得上达，祂用凿过的石头挡住我的道；祂翻转我的路。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀3.8.htm">3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀3.9.htm">9</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />你们践踏被压碎的，向他勒索麦子；你们用凿过的石头建造房屋，却不得住在其内。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.11.htm">5:11</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“凿过的石头”表示诸如自我的聪明在信仰问题上所产生的那种事物。<br />由于“凿过的石头”表示这些事物，故以色列人过了约旦河之后在迦南地首先建造的祭坛，是由未凿过的石头建的；因为越过约旦河代表引入主的国度，这种引入是通过信之真理实现的。论到这个祭坛，经上在约书亚记中如此记着说：<br />约书亚在以巴路山上为耶和华以色列的神筑一座坛，照耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐以色列人的话，是用人没有动过铁器的整石头筑的坛。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.30.htm">8:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.31.htm">31</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.1.htm">27:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.8.htm">8</a>）<br />耶路撒冷的殿同样是用未凿过的整石头建的。论到这个殿，经上在列王纪上中如此记着说：<br />论到这殿本身，建殿的时候，是从那里所来的整块石头建的；当建的时候，在殿里没有听见锤子、斧子和别样铁器的响声。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.7.htm">6:7</a>）<br />因为主的殿代表神性真理方面的主。殿代表主，主自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.22.htm">22</a>）教导了这一点；之所以代表神性真理方面的主，是因为那里教导的是神性真理；这也是为何它是用石头建的；因为“石头”表示神性真理（<a href="8940.htm">8940</a>节）；这还解释了为何主被称为“以色列的石头”（<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）。<br />由此可见石坛表示什么，殿的石头表示什么，以及未凿过的整块石头表示什么，即：宗教要由源于主，因而源于圣言的真理形成，不可由自我聪明形成。出于自我聪明的真理在以赛亚书中是如此被描述的：<br />匠人铸造雕像，金匠用金包裹，为它铸造银链。他寻找熟练的匠人，预备雕像。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.19.htm">40:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“雕像”表示出于自我或人自己的某种宗教虚构物，它被立起来当作神性之物被敬拜（参看<a href="8869.htm">8869</a>节）；“匠人”表示那些出于自我孵化并产生的事物；他“用金包裹”、“铸造银链”、“寻找熟练的匠人”描述了他们试图使这些事物看似真理。<br /><br />制造雕像的尽都虚空他的同伴都必羞愧！匠人们不过是人。他用火钳塑造铁器，用锤打出形状，用他有力的膀臂锤成；他制作木块，拉出线绳，用直尺做记号。他把它作成角，用圆规画出模样，仿照男人的体态，照着人的美丽，作成它，好住在房屋中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.9.htm">44:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.11.htm">11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这段经文也描述了出于自我聪明的宗教虚构物。类似的话出现在耶利米书：<br />列族的风俗是虚空的。他从森林中砍伐木头，匠人的手用斧子制成的作品。他们用银用金妆饰它，用钉子和锤子钉稳它。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.3.htm">10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />以及何西阿书：<br />现今他们犯罪越来越多，用银子为自己做铸像，就是照自己的聪明做偶像，都是匠人的工作。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.2.htm">13:2</a>）<br />“偶像”、“外邦的神”、“铸像”和“雕像”表示由自我聪明所孵化，而非源于圣言的宗教虚构物，自我的产物不是别的；因为它们本身是死的，尽管被当作活的来崇拜。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8941</b></p><p><b>8941.</b>
Thou shalt not build it of hewn stones. That this signifies that it must not be from self-intelligence, is evident from the signification of "hewn stones," as being such things as are from self-intelligence; 
for "stones" denote truths (see n. 8940); and to "hew," or fit, them denotes to hatch or devise truths, or such things as resemble truths, from one's own, or from self-intelligence. For things 
which are hatched or devised from one's own, or from self-intelligence, have their life from man, which life is no life, because man's own is nothing but evil (n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876,874-876, 987, 
1047, 5660, 5786, 8480); whereas that which is not from man's own, but from the Divine, has life in itself, because all life is from the Divine. The worship of the Lord from truth is here treated of, 
for this worship is signified by "an altar of stones" (n. 8940). [2] The truths from which the Lord is to be worshiped are to be taken solely from the Word, for in every detail of the Word there is 
life from the Divine. When truths are taken from one's own, they regard and have as their end dignity and eminence over all in the world, and likewise earthly possessions and wealth above all men, and 
therefore they have in them the love of self and of the world, thus all evils in the complex (n. 7488, 8318). But truths which are from the Word regard and have as their end eternal life, and have in 
them love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor, thus all goods in the complex. When truths are hatched from one's own, or from self-intelligence, they rule over the truths which are from the Divine, 
because these are applied to confirm them; when yet the contrary should be the case, namely, that truths from the Divine should rule, and those which are from self-intelligence should serve. Those 
which are from one's own, or from self-intelligence, are called truths, but they are not truths; they only appear as truths in the external form, for they are rendered like truths by means of applications 
from the literal sense of the Word, and by reasonings, while in the internal form they are falsities (what and of what quality they are, see above, n. 8932). [3] There are in the world two religiosities 
which are from self-intelligence-one in which the love of self and of the world is everything, which religion is that which is called in the Word "Babel;" it is inwardly profane from the love 
of self and of the world, and outwardly holy from the Word which has been applied to confirm. The other religiosity is that in which the light of nature is everything; they who are in this acknowledge 
nothing as truth which they do not apprehend. Some from this religiosity acknowledge the Word, but they apply it for confirmation, thus to serve. Some however do not acknowledge the Word; but these 
make the Divine to consist in nature, for their light, being of nature, falls into nature, and cannot be enlightened by the light of heaven, because they reject the Word from which is all enlightenment. 
Those who are from these two religiosities are in hell, because they are void of heavenly life, which they cannot receive because they have rejected the Word. And those of them who have applied the 
Word for confirmation, have made the Word of none effect in their hearts; but because of its great authority with the common people, they have used it for this service, in order to give weight to the 
devices of their own intelligence. From all this it can be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by the altar not being to be built of hewn stones. [4] By "hewn stone" is signified that which 
is from self-intelligence in the following passages also: </p>
<p>That the people may know, Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in haughtiness and pride of heart, The bricks are fallen, and we 
will build with hewn stone (Isa. 9:9, 10).      Although I cry and shout, He hath shut out my prayers, He hath fenced about my ways with hewn stone, He hath overturned my paths (Lam. 3:8, 9).     
 Forasmuch as ye trample upon the worn one, and seize from him the burden of wheat; ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them (Amos 5:11). In these passages "hewn stone" denotes 
such things in matters of faith as are from self-intelligence. [5] Such being the signification of "hewn stone," therefore the altar first built in the land of Canaan by the sons of Israel after 
they had passed over the Jordan, was built of unhewn stones; for by the passage over the Jordan was represented introduction into the kingdom of the Lord, which is effected by means of the truths of faith. 
Of this altar it is thus written in Joshua: </p>
<p>     Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah the God of Israel in Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the sons of Israel, an altar of whole 
stones, upon which no man had moved iron (Josh. 8:30, 31; also Deut. 27:1-8). [6] In like manner the temple of Jerusalem was built of whole stones unhewn, of which it is thus written in the first 
book of the Kings: </p>
<p>     As to the house itself, when it was in building, it was built of whole stone, as it was brought; for there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tools of iron heard in the house, 
while it was in building (1 Kings 6:7). For by the temple of the Lord was represented the Lord as to Divine truth. That the Lord was represented by the temple, He Himself teaches in John 2:19, 21, 
22; and that He was represented as to the Divine truth, was because this truth was there taught; for which reason also it was built of stones, because by "stones" was signified Divine truth (n. 8940); 
and hence also the Lord Himself was called the "Stone of Israel" (n. 6426). [7] From all this it is now evident what was signified by the stone of the altar, and what also by the stone of the temple, 
likewise what by the stones being whole and unhewn, namely, that religion was to be formed by truths from the Lord, thus from the Word, and not from self-intelligence. Truths which are from self-intelligence 
are thus described also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The workman casteth a graven image, and the founder overlayeth it with gold, and casteth silver chains. He seeketh an intelligent workman to prepare 
a graven image (Isa. 40:19, 20). "A graven image" denotes a religiosity that is from one's own, which is set up to be worshiped as Divine (see n. 8869); "the workman" denotes those who hatch and devise 
from one's own; that they may appear like truths is described by his "overlaying it with gold," "casting silver chains," and "seeking an intelligent workman." [8] Again: </p>
<p>     They that form a graven 
image are all of them vanity. All his fellows shall be ashamed, and the workmen themselves. He fashioneth the iron with the tongs, and worketh with coal, and formeth it with sharp hammers; thus he 
worketh it with the arm of his strength; he fashioneth pieces of wood, he stretcheth out a thread, and marketh it off with a rule; he maketh it into its angles, and defineth it with a compass, that he 
may make it in the form of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house (Isa. 44:9, 11-13). in this passage also is described a religiosity which is from self-intelligence. In like 
manner in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The statutes of the nations are vanity; surely he cutteth out wood from the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with an axe. He decketh it with silver and with gold; 
he fasteneth it with nails and with hammers (Jer. 10:3, 4). And also in Hosea: </p>
<p>     Nevertheless now they sin more and more, and make them a molten image of silver, idols in their intelligence, all 
the work of the craftsmen (Hos. 13:2). A religiosity that is hatched from self-intelligence, and not derived from the Word, is meant in the internal sense by "idols" and "strange gods," by "molten 
images" and "graven images," for the things which are from one's own are nothing else, because in themselves they are dead, and yet are adored as living. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8941</b></p><p><b>8941.</b>
'You shall not build it with hewn ones' means that it must not be a product of self-intelligence. This is clear from the meaning of 'hewn stones' as the kinds of things which are products of self-intelligence, 
for 'stones' are truths, <a href="8940.htm">8940</a>, and chiselling or shaping them means producing or fashioning truths, or rather notions made to look like truths, out of the self, that is, out of self-intelligence. 
For the life in anything produced or fashioned by the self or self-intelligence is derived from the person; and such life is not life at all since the human self or proprium is nothing but evil, <a href="210.htm">210</a>, <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>, <a href="987.htm">987</a>, <a href="1047.htm">1047</a>, <a href="5660.htm">5660</a>, <a href="5786.htm">5786</a>, <a href="8480.htm">8480</a>, whereas what is not derived from the self but from God does have life within it, since God is the source of all life. The subject here is worship 
of the Lord that springs from truth, for that kind of worship is meant by 'an altar of stones', <a href="8940.htm">8940</a>.	. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Truths that inspire worship of the Lord should be derived from nowhere  other than the 
Word; for in every single part the Word has life from God. When truths are derived from the self they have as their end in view rank and prominence over everyone in the world, and also earthly possessions 
and wealth above everyone. Consequently they hold within them self-love and love of the world, thus all evils in their entirety, <a href="7488.htm">7488</a>, <a href="8318.htm">8318</a>. But truths derived from the Word have eternal life as 
their end in view; they hold within them love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, thus all forms of good in their entirety. When truths are produced out of the self or self-intelligence they are 
the masters over the truths which come from God; for they employ the latter to add strength to themselves. But it ought to be the other way round, that is to say, the truths from God ought to be the 
masters, and those that are products of self-intelligence to be the servants. Products of the self or self-intelligence are called truths, but they are not really truths; they look like truths solely 
to outward appearances. For the literal sense of the Word is employed, and reasonings are brought in, to make them look like truths; but inwardly they are falsities. What these things are exactly, and 
what they are like, see above in <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the world there are two semblances of religion that exist as a result of self-intelligence. One is that in which self-love and love of the world is 
everything; in the Word this semblance of religion is called Babel. Inwardly it is profane on account of self-love and love of the world, while outwardly it is holy on account of the Word, which people 
have employed to add strength to their own ideas. The other semblance of religion is that in which the inferior light of the natural order is everything. Those with this kind of religion acknowledge 
nothing to be true which they do not apprehend. Some belonging to this seeming religion acknowledge the Word, yet they employ it to add strength to their own ideas; thus they treat it as their servant. 
Others however do not acknowledge the Word; instead they identify the Divine with the natural order. For the light in which they see, being the inferior light of the natural order, shines only within 
the natural order and cannot be made brighter by the superior light of heaven, because they cast aside the Word, the source of all enlightenment. Those belonging to both the latter and the former semblances 
of religion are in hell, because they are devoid of heavenly life, which they cannot receive because they have cast the Word aside. And those of them who have employed the Word to add strength 
to their own ideas have set no value at all on it in their hearts; yet because it has had power and authority among the common people they have used it to serve them in this way, in order that false 
notions fashioned by their own intelligence might thereby be validated. From all this one may see what is meant in the spiritual sense by the command that no altar of hewn stones was to be built. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
'Hewn stone' means that which is a product of self-intelligence in the following places as well: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
In order that [all] the people may know, Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, on account 
of pride and arrogance of heart, saying, The bucks have fallen and we will build from hewn stone <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Even if I cry and shout, He has shut out my prayers. He has fenced 
round my ways with hewn stone, He has overturned my paths. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%203:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 3:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Because you tread down the crushed, and seize from him the burden of grain, you will build houses of hewn stone, 
yet you will not dwell in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Hewn stone' here stands for the kinds of things that self-intelligence produces in matters of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Since those things were meant by 'hewn stone', 
the altar first built in the land of Canaan by the children of Israel after they crossed the Jordan was built of unhewn stones; for crossing over Jordan represented introduction into the Lord's 
kingdom, which is accomplished by means of the truths of faith. That altar is spoken of as follows in Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
Joshua built an altar to Jehovah God of Israel on Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah 
had commanded the children of Israel, An altar of whole stones over which no one has wielded any iron tool.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%208:30,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 8:30, 31</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2027:1-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 27:1-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The temple in Jerusalem likewise was built of whole, 
not hewn, stones. This is referred to in the first Book of Kings as follows, </p>
<p>As regards the house itself, when it was being built it was built of whole stone, as it had been brought [there]; 
for not a hammer or axe, [nor] any tool of iron, was heard in the house while it was being built. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 6:7. </p>
<p>For by 'the temple of the Lord' was represented the Lord in respect of Divine Truth. The 
Lord Himself teaches that He was represented by the temple, in John 2:19, <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="22.htm">22</a>; and the reason why He was represented in respect of Divine Truth was that Divine Truth was taught there. This also 
was why it was built of stones; for 'stones' meant Divine Truth, <a href="8940.htm">8940</a>. And it also explains why the Lord was called 'the Stone of Israel', <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From all this one may now see what was meant by 
the stone of the altar, and also what was meant by the stone of the temple, as well as what was meant by the requirement that they were to be whole stones, and not hewn, namely this: Religion should be 
composed of truths derived from the Lord, thus from the Word, and not from self-intelligence. Products of self-intelligence are also described in the following way in Isaiah, </p>
<p>The craftsman casts 
a graven image, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it. He seeks a skilled<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> craftsman to make ready a graven image. Isa. 40:19, <a href="20.htm">20</a>. </p>
<p>'A graven image' stands for some religious 
fabrication that is a product of the proprium or self, put forward to be venerated as what is Divine, <a href="8869.htm">8869</a>. 'The craftsman' stands for those who from self produce and fashion things. Their attempt 
to make these things look like truths is described by 'a goldsmith! overlays it with gold, and casts chains made of silver' and 'he seeks a skilled craftsman'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>Makers 
of the graven image, all are vanity. All his companions will be ashamed; and the workmen themselves ... He fashions the iron with tongs, and works it with the coals, and forms it with sharp hammers; 
so he makes it with his strong arm.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> He fashions pieces of wood, stretches out a cord, and marks it off with a ruler. He makes it into its angles, and marks it out with a ring, so that he may make 
it in the form of a man (vir), according to the beauty of a human being, to dwell in the house. Isa. 44:9, <a href="11.htm">11</a>-<a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>This too describes a religious fabrication that is a product of self-intelligence. 
Something similar occurs in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>The customs<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> of the nations are vanity. Since indeed one cuts out wood from the forest, the work of the hands of the workman using an axe, he decorates it 
with silver and gold; and they make it firm<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> with pegs and hammers. Jer. 10:3, <a href="4.htm">4</a>. </p>
<p>And also in Hosea, </p>
<p>Nonetheless they now sin more and more, and make for themselves a molten image from silver, 
idols by their own intelligence, completely the work of craftsmen. Hosea 13:2 </p>
<p>A religious fabrication, produced out of self-intelligence and not derived from the Word, is meant in the internal 
sense by 'idols' and 'strange gods', by 'molten images' and 'graven images'. Products of the self are nothing else; for in themselves they are dead, even though venerated as living.

</p><b>8941.</b>
`Non aedificabis illos caesos': quod significet quod non ex propria intelligentia, constat ex significatione `lapidum caesorum' quod sint talia quae ex propria intelligentia, `lapides' enim sunt vera, 
n. 8940, et illos secare seu aptare, est vera seu talia quae veris similia sunt excludere aut fingere ex proprio, seu ex propria intelligentia; quae enim ex proprio seu ex propria intelligentia excluduntur 
aut finguntur vitam habent ex homine, quae vita est nulla vita, nam proprium hominis non est nisi quam malum, n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876, 987, 1047, 5660, 5786, 8480; at (x)quod non ex proprio 
sed ex Divino, id vitam in se habet, nam a Divino est omnis vita; agitur hic de cultu Domini ex vero, nam is cultus per `altare lapidum' significatur, n. 8940. 	[2] Vera ex quibus colendus est Dominus 
non nisi quam ex Verbo sumenda sunt, nam in singulis ibi {1} est vita a Divino; quando vera ex proprio sumuntur, spectant illa et pro fine habent dignitatem et eminentiam super omnes in mundo, et quoque 
possessiones terrae ac opulentiam super omnes, quare in se habent amorem sui et mundi ita omnia mala in complexu, n. 7488, 8318; at vera quae ex Verbo spectant et pro fine {2} habent vitam aeternam, 
et in se habent amorem in Dominum et amorem erga proximum, ita omnia bona in complexu; quando vera ex proprio seu (o)ex propria intelligentia excluduntur, dominantur illa super vera quae a Divino, 
nam applicantur haec ad confirmanda illa {3}; cum tamen contrarium erit, quod nempe vera a Divino dominatura sint, et quae ex propria intelligentia servitura. Quae ex proprio seu ex propria intelligentia, 
dicuntur vera, sed non sunt vera, modo apparent ut vera in externa forma, nam per applicationes ex sensu litterali Verbi et per ratiocinia reddantur veris similia; in interna autem forma sunt falsa; 
quaenam et qualia sunt illa, videatur supra n. 8932. {4} 	[3] Sunt in mundo bina religiosa quae sunt ex propria intelligentia {5}; unum in quo amor sui et mundi omne est; hoc religiosum in Verbo 
vocatur Babel; est intus profanum ex amore sui et mundi, et extus est sanctum ex Verbo, quod applicuerunt ad confirmandum; alterum (o)religiosum est in quo lumen naturae omne est; qui in illo sunt nihil 
agnoscunt pro vero quod non capiunt; quidam ex hoc religioso agnoscunt Verbum, sed applicant ad confirmandum, ita ad serviendum; quidam (o)autem non agnoscunt Verbum, sed hi Divinum ponunt in natura 
{6}, nam lumen eorum quia est naturae, in naturam cadit, nec illustrari potest a luce caeli, quia Verbum, unde omnis illustratio, rejiciunt; qui ex hoc aut illo religioso sunt in inferno sunt, quia 
{7} expertes vitae (m)caelestis sunt quam nec recipere possunt quia rejecerunt Verbum {8}; et qui eorum applicuerunt Verbum ad confirmandum, Verbum nihili fecerunt in corde, sed quia valuit auctoritate 
in vulgo, usi sunt eo pro illo servitio ut figmenta ex propria intelligentia per id valerent {9}.(n)  Ex his constare potest quid in sensu spirituali significat quod altare non ex lapidibus caesis 
aedificandum esset. 	[4] Per `lapidem caesum' etiam significatur id quod ex propria intelligentia in sequentibus locis': apud Esaiam, 	Ut cognoscant populus Ephraim, et habitator Samariae, propter 
elationem et superbiam cordis, dicendo, Lateres ceciderunt, et lapide caeso aedificabimus, ix 8, 9 [A.V. 9, 10]: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Etiamsi clamo et vociferor, obstruit preces meas; circumsepsit vias meas 
lapide caeso, semitas meas evertit, Threni iii 8, 9: </p>
<p>apud Amos, 	Quoniam conculcatis attritum, et onus frumenti rapitis ab eo, domos lapidis caesi aedificabitis, sed non habitabitis in iis, v 11; </p>
<p>ibi 
`lapis caesus' pro talibus in rebus fidei quae ex propria intelligentia. 	[5] Quia illa {10} per `lapidem caesum' significabantur, idcirco altare primo exstructum in terra Canaane (m)a filiis 
Israelis postquam {11} transiverunt Jordanem, (c)a lapidibus non caesis exstructum est, nam per `transitum super Jordanem' repraesentabatur introductio in regnum Domini, quae fit per vera fidei {12}; 
de (c)illo altari ita apud Joschuam, 	Aedificavit Jehoschua altare [Jehovae] Deo Israelis in monte Ebal, quemadmodum praecepit Moscheh servus Jehovae filiis Israelis, Altare lapidum integrorum super 
quos non moverat ferrum viii 30, 31;(n) (o)Deut. xxvii 1-8. [6] Templum Hierosolymae pariter {13} ex lapidibus integris non caesis aedificatum est, de quo ita in Libro Primo Regum, 	Quoad ipsam domum, 
cum aedificaretur, lapide integro, prout allatus, aedificata est; nam malleus aut (x)securis, ulla instrumenta ferri, non audita sunt in domo cum aedificaretur, vi 7; </p>
<p>per `templum' enim Domini {14} 
repraesentatus est Dominus quoad Divinum Verum; quod {15} Dominus per templum repraesentatus sit, docet Ipse, Joh. ii 19, 21, 22, et quod quoad Divinum Verum, erat quia id ibi docebatur; quare etiam 
aedificatum est ex lapidibus, nam per `lapides' significabatur Divinum Verum {16}, n. 8940; inde etiam Ipse Dominus vocatus est `Lapis Israelis,' n. 6426. 	[7] Ex his {17} nunc patet quid lapis altaris, 
ut et {18} quid lapis templi significabat, tum quid quod lapides integri essent, et non caesi, quod nempe religio formanda sit a veris ex Domino, ita ex Verbo {19}, et non ex propria intelligentia. 
 Quae ex propria intelligentia (o)sunt, ita quoque describuntur apud Esaiam, 	Sculptile fundit artifex, et conflator auro obducit illud: et catenas argenti conflat; artificem intelligentem quaerit 
ad praeparandum sculptile, xl 19, 20; </p>
<p>`sculptile' pro religioso quod ex proprio, quod datur adorandum sicut Divinum, n. 8869, `artifex' pro illis qui ex proprio excludunt et fingunt; ut appareant veris 
{20} similia, describitur per quod `auro obducat illud, [et] catenas ex argento conflet, {21} artificem intelligentem quaerat': [8] apud eundem, 	Formatores sculptilis omnes vanitas; omnes socii 
ejus pudefient, et fabri ipsi: fabricat ferrum forcipe, et operatur carbone, et malleis acutis format illud; sic operatur illud per brachium roboris sui: (m)(x)fabricat ligna, extendit filum, et describit 
illud amussi; facit illud in angulos suos, et circulo definit illud, ut faciat in forma viri, juxta pulchritudinem hominis, ad habitandum in domo,(n) xliv (x)9, 11-13; </p>
<p>etiam hic describitur religiosum 
quod ex propria intelligentia: similiter apud Jeremiam, 	Statuta gentium vanitas illa; siquidem lignum de silva excidit, opus {22} manuum fabri per securim; argento et auro exornat illud; clavis 
et malleis firmat, x 3, 4: </p>
<p>et quoque apud Hoscheam, 	Nihilominus nunc addunt peccare, et faciunt sibi fusile ex argento; in intelligentia sua idola, opus artificum totum, xiii 2. Religiosum quod 
ex propria intelligentia excluditur et non ex Verbo, intelligitur in sensu interno per `idola, deos alienos,' per `fusilia,' et per `sculptilia,' nam quae ex proprio non aliud sunt; sunt enim in se mortua, 
et quoque adorantur sicut viva. @1 Verbi$ @2 After habent$ @3 i, ita serviunt Divina$ @4 In A this sentence was written on a separate sheet which has not been preserved.$ @5 proprio$ @6 naturam
