CONTINUATION CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND OR WITH HEAVEN, HERE CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HEARING AND OF THE EARS WITH THAT MAN. What is the nature of the correspondence between 
the soul and the body, or between the things of the spirit which is within man and those of his body which are without him, may be plainly seen from the correspondence, influx, and communication of 
the thought and perception, which are of the spirit, with the speech and hearing, which are of the body. The thought of a man who is speaking is nothing but the speech of his spirit, and the perception 
of the speech is nothing but the hearing of his spirit. When man is speaking, his thought does not indeed appear to him as speech, because it conjoins itself with the speech of his body, and is in it; 
and when man hears, his perception appears merely like hearing in the ear. This is the reason why most persons who have not reflected know no otherwise than that all sense is in the organs of the body, 
and consequently that when these organs fall to decay by death, nothing of sense survives, whereas the man (that is, his spirit) then comes into his veriest life of sensation. [2] That it is the 
spirit which speaks and hears has been made very manifest to me from conversations with spirits. Their speech communicated to my spirit fell into my interior speech, and thence into the corresponding 
organs, and there terminated in an endeavor which I have sometimes plainly perceived. Hence their speech was heard by me as sonorously as the speech of a man. Sometimes when spirits spoke with me in 
the midst of a company of men, some of the spirits supposed that as their speech was heard so sonorously, they would be heard by the other people who were there present; but they were informed that such 
was not the case, because their speech flowed into my ear by an internal way, and human speech flows in by an external way. This shows how the spirit spoke with the prophets-not as a man with a man, 
but as a spirit with a man, that is, in him (see Zech. 1:9, 13; 2:2, 7; 4:1, 4, 5; 5:10; 6:4; and in other places). But I know that these things cannot be comprehended by those who do not believe that 
man is a spirit, and that the body merely serves this spirit for uses in this world. Those who have confirmed themselves in this unbelief are unwilling even to hear about any correspondence, and being 
in denial, if they do hear of it they reject it, and are rather made sad that anything should be taken away from the body. </p>

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN, WHICH IS HEAVEN - continued IN THIS SECTION THE CORRESPONDENCE OF HEARING AND OF THE EARS WITH HEAVEN </p>
<p>The nature of the correspondence that exists between the soul 
and the body - that is, between the things constituting a person's inward spirit and those constituting his outward body - may be clearly recognized from the correspondence, influx, and communication 
of thought and discernment, which are functions of the spirit, with speech and hearing, which are functions of the body. When a person is speaking, his thought is nothing else than the power of speech 
which his spirit possesses, while his discernment of speech is nothing else than the power of hearing which his spirit possesses. When a person speaks, his thought does not, it is true, present itself 
to him as speech because it links itself to and is present within the power of speech that his body possesses. And when he hears something his discernment of it seems to him to be simply a hearing 
within his ear. For this reason the majority of people who have not stopped to reflect on the matter do not know that all five senses are located somewhere else than within organs belonging to the body; 
so they think that when these organs cease to function through death no sensory perception remains, when in actual fact a person, that is, his spirit, then passes into a life of perfect sensory perception. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The fact that it is the spirit which has the powers of speech and hearing has become quite clear to me from my conversations with spirits. Their speech was communicated to my spirit; 
it entered my own interior power of speech, and from there into the organs corresponding to it. What they communicated ended as an endeavour in me, which I have perceived clearly on several occasions. 
Consequently I have heard what they said in tones as clear as anything spoken by someone on earth. Sometimes spirits have spoken to me while I was among a group of people, and some of those spirits 
have imagined that, because I could hear so clearly what they - the spirits - said, those people present with me could hear them too. But I have told them that their speech was flowing into my ear by 
the internal route, whereas human speech comes in by the external route. From this one may see how a spirit spoke to one of the prophets - not as a man speaks to another man but as a spirit speaks to 
a man, that is to say, within him - as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%201:9,%2013,%2019;%202:3;%204:1,%204,%205;%205:5,%2010;%206:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 1:9, 13, 19; 2:3; 4:1, 4, 5; 5:5, 10; 6:4</a>; and elsewhere. But I realize that these matters are unintelligible to people who do not believe that man is a 
spirit, the body serving him solely for functions to be performed in the world. Those who have become quite convinced that man is not a spirit refuse even to listen to talk about any kind of correspondence; 
and if they do listen they reject what they hear because they have a negative attitude Indeed they are unhappy if anything is said not to belong to the body. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia cum Maximo Homine seu cum Caelo; hic de Correspondentia Auditus et Aurium cum illo </p>
<p>Qualis correspondentia est inter animam et corpus, seu inter illa quae sunt spiritus 
qui intra hominem, et illa quae sunt corporis quae extra illum, constare manifeste potest ex correspondentia, influxu et communicatione cogitationis et apperceptionis quae sunt spiritus, cum 
loquela et auditu quae sunt corporis; cogitatio loquentis hominis non est nisi loquela ejus spiritus, et apperceptio loquelae non est nisi auditus ejus spiritus; cogitatio quando homo loquitur, non 
quidem apparet ei sicut loquela quia conjungit se cum loquela corporis et inest illi; </p>
<p>et apperceptio quando homo audit, non apparet aliter quam sicut auditus in aure; inde est quod plerique qui non 
reflexerunt, non aliter sciant quam quod omnis sensus sit in organis quae sunt corporis, et inde {1} cum organa illa per mortem collabuntur, nihil sensus supersit; cum tamen tunc homo, hoc est, spiritus 
ejus in ipsissimam suam vitam sensitivam {2}venit.  Quod spiritus sit qui loquitur et qui audit, manifeste mihi constare 2 potuit ex colloquiis cum spiritibus; illorum loquela communicata spiritui 
meo incidebat in interiorem meam loquelam, (c)ac inde in organa correspondentia, ac ibi desinebat in conatum, quem aliquoties manifeste percepi; inde loquela eorum tam sonore mihi audita fuit sicut 
loquela hominis; quandoque cum mecum locuti sunt spiritus in medio consortio hominum, quia loquela eorum tam sonore audita est, putarunt aliqui eorum quod etiam a praesentibus ibi audirentur; 
sed responsum quod non ita sit quia loquela illorum per viam internam influit in aurem meam, {3}et loquela humana per viam externam.  Inde patet quomodo spiritus cum prophetis locutus {4}est, non 
sicut homo cum homine, sed sicut spiritus cum homine, nempe in illo, {5} Zach. i 9, 13; ii 2, 7 [A.V. i 19; ii 3]; iv 1, 4, 5; v 5, 10; vi 4, et alibi.  Sed scio quod haec non comprehendere possint 
illi qui non credunt hominem esse spiritum, et corpus inservire ei pro usibus in mundo; illi {6}qui se confirmarunt in eo, ne quidem audire volunt de aliqua correspondentia, et si audiunt, quia 
in negativo sunt, rejiciunt; immo etiam contristantur quod aliquid corpori auferatur.      @1 i quod$      @2 veniat$      @3 sed$      @4 sit$      @5 i ut$      @6 si$ </p>
