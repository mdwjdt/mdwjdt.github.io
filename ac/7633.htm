<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7633节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7633.</strong>“为要把我的神迹放在他中间”表好叫恶人知道他们陷入邪恶，叫善人对教会里那些过着邪恶生活之人的状态能有所启示。这从“神迹”的含义清楚可知，“神迹”是指对真理的确证，因而是指对真理的认识（参看<a href="6870.htm">6870</a>节），以及在真理上的启示（<a href="7012.htm">7012</a>节）；因此，“把神迹放在他中间”表示好叫恶人知道他们陷入邪恶。它还表示叫善人对教会里那些过着邪恶生活之人的状态能有所启示，这一点从接下来的经文明显看出来；在那里，经上说：“并要叫你在你儿子和你孙子的耳中讲述我在埃及所作的事，和我放在他们中间的神迹”，以此表示叫那些处于真理和良善的人能知道那些属于教会并侵扰正直人的人所遭遇的事。在来世侵扰正直人的，是那些曾属于教会，并知道信的诫命，然而却过着违背它们的生活之人（参看<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>，<a href="7545.htm">7545</a>，<a href="7554.htm">7554</a>节）。</p>

That I may set these My signs in the midst of them. That this signifies that the evil may know that they are in evil, and that the good may be enlightened as to the state of those within the church who 
live evilly, is evident from the signification of "signs," as being confirmations of truths, and thus knowledges (see n. 6870), and also enlightenments (n. 7012); hence "to set signs in the midst of 
them" denotes that the evil may know that they are in evil. That it also denotes that the good may be enlightened as to the state of those within the church who live evilly, is plain from what presently 
follows, where it is said, "and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and My signs which I have set in them," whereby is signified 
that they who are in truth and good may know what befalls those of the church who infest the upright. (That they who in the other life infest the upright are those who have been of the church and have 
known the precepts of faith, and yet have lived contrary to them, see n. 7317, 7502, 7545, 7554.) </p>

'And I will set these My signs in the midst of him' means in order that the evil may recognize that they are ruled by evil, and the good may be enlightened regarding the state of those within the Church 
who lead an evil life. This is clear from the meaning of 'signs' as corroborations of truths, and so recognition of them, dealt with in <a href="6870.htm">6870</a>, and also enlightenment in them, <a href="7012.htm">7012</a>; therefore 'setting 
signs in the midst of him' means in order that the evil may recognize they are ruled by evil. As regards the further meaning, in order that the good may be enlightened regarding the state of those 
within the Church who lead an evil life, this is evident from what immediately follows. There it says, 'And in order that you may tell in the ears of your son and your son's son the deeds which I have 
performed in Egypt, and My signs which I have set among them', meaning in order that those guided by truth and governed by good may know what happens to the ones belonging to the Church who molest the 
upright. The fact that those in the next life who molest the upright are people who have belonged to the Church and been acquainted with, yet led a life contrary to the commands that faith prescribes,

`{1}Et ponam signa Mea haec in medio illius': quod significet {2}ut cognoscant mali quod in malo sint, et boni illustrentur de statu illorum qui intra Ecclesiam male vivunt, constat ex significatione 
`signorum' quod sint confirmationes veritatum, ac ita cognitiones, de qua n. 6870, et quoque illustrationes, n. 7012; inde `ponere signa in medio illius' est ut cognoscant mali quod in malo sint; quod 
etiam sit ut boni illustrentur de statu illorum qui intra Ecclesiam male vivunt, patet a mox sequentibus, ubi dicitur `Et propterea ut narres in auribus filii tui, et filii filii tui, quae operatus 
sum in Aegypto, et signa Mea quae posui in illis,' per quae significatur ut sciant qui in vero et bono quid evenit illis ab Ecclesia qui infestant probos.  Quod illi qui in altera vita probos infestant 
sint qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt et noverunt praecepta fidei, et tamen contra illa vixerunt, videatur n. 7317, 7502, 7545, 7554. 	@1 cp n. 7629$ 	@2 quod$ </p>
