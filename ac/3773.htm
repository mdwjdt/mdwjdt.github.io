<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3773节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3773.</strong>“随后又把石头放在井口的原处”表它暂时被封住了。这从前面关于井口上的石头的阐述（<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>，<a href="3771.htm">3771</a>节）清楚可知。关于圣言向教会敞开，后来又被封住，情况是这样：任何教会在建立之初，圣言一开始向教会中人封闭，但后来按照主的规定被打开。人们从圣言得知，一切教义都培养在这两条诫命的基础上，即：爱主高于一切，爱邻如己。当这两条诫命被视为目的时，圣言就被打开了；因为一切律法和先知，也就是整部圣言，端赖于这两条诫命，以至于一切事物皆来源于它们，因此一切事物皆指向它们。在这种情况下，受真理与良善的首要原则主导的教会中人就会在他们从圣言中所看到的每一个具体事物上接受光明。因为那时，主通过天使与他们同在，并教导他们（尽管他们没有意识到这一点），还把他们引入真理与良善的生活中。<br />这一点也可从以下情形看出来：所有教会在幼年期都是这样，出于爱敬拜主，发自内心爱邻舍。但随着时间推移，教会逐渐背离这两条诫命，从爱与仁之善转向所谓的信之事物，因而从生活转向教义。他们越这样行，圣言就越被封住。这一切就是这些话在内义上所表示的：“看哪，田间有一口井，看哪，有三群羊卧在井旁；因为他们饮羊群，都是用那井里的水；井口上有一块大石头。所有的羊群都在那里聚集；他们就滚开井口的石头饮羊群，随后又把石头放在井口的原处。”</p>

And they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth. That this signifies that meanwhile it was closed, is evident from what has been said (n. 3769, 3771) concerning the stone upon the well's 
mouth. As regards the Word being opened to the churches, and being afterwards closed, the case is this: in the beginning of the setting up of any church, the Word is at first closed to the men of 
it, and is afterwards opened, the Lord so providing; and thus they learn that all doctrine is founded on the two commandments-that the Lord is to be loved above all things, and the neighbor as themselves. 
When these two commandments are regarded as the end, the Word is opened; for all the Law and the Prophets, that is, the whole Word, so depend on these commandments that all things are derived from 
them and therefore all have reference to them. And whereas the men of the church are then in the principles of truth and good, they are enlightened in everything they see in the Word; for the Lord is 
then present with them by means of angels, and teaches them (although they are unaware of this), and also leads them into the life of truth and good.  [2] This may be seen also from the case of all 
churches, in that they were such in their infancy, and worshiped the Lord from love, and loved the neighbor from the heart. But in process of time churches withdraw from these two commandments, and turn 
aside from the good of love and charity to the so-called things of faith, thus from life to doctrine; and insofar as they do this, so far the Word is closed. This is what is signified in the internal 
sense by the words: "Behold a well in the field, and behold there three-droves of the flock lying by it; for out of that well they watered the droves; and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 
And all the droves were gathered together thither; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock, and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3773</b></p><p><b>3773.</b>
'And they would put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well' means that it was closed up for the time being. This is clear from what has been stated about the stone over the mouth of the 
well, in <a href="3769.htm">3769</a>, <a href="3771.htm">3771</a>. With regard to these considerations, namely that the Word was uncovered for the Churches and after that closed up, the position is that in the beginning, when any Church is established, 
the Word is in that initial period closed up to them but later on, through the Lord's provision, is opened up. And from there people learn that all doctrine is based on these two commandments, 
that the Lord is to be loved above everything else, and the neighbour as themselves. When these two commandments are the end in view the Word is in that case opened up, for all the Law and all the 
Prophets, that is, the whole of the Word, hangs on them, as does everything from them, and so everything has reference to them. And being in that case governed by the primary teachings concerning truth 
and good people receive light in each particular thing they see in the Word. For the Lord is present with them at that time by means of angels and is teaching them even though they are not directly 
aware of it, and is also guiding them into the life of truth and good. </p>
<p></p>

 This may also be seen from the consideration that in their infancy all Churches have been such, and have from love worshipped 
the Lord, and have from the heart loved the neighbour. But in course of time Churches have moved away from these two commandments, and have turned away from good flowing from love and charity towards 
those things called matters of faith, and so have turned away from life towards doctrine. And to the extent this happens the Word is closed up. These are the factors meant in the internal sense by 
the words, 'Behold, a well in the field, and behold, three droves of a flock there, lying nearby it; for out of that well they watered the droves; and there was a large stone over the mouth of the well. 
And all the droves would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from over the mouth of the well and water the flock; and they would put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well'. </p>

`Et reducebant lapidem super os putei ad locum suum': quod significet quod interea esset occlusum, constat ex illis quae de lapide super ore putei n. 3769, 3771 dicta sunt.  Cum his quod nempe Verbum 
reclusum sit Ecclesiis, et dein quod occlusum, ita se habet: in principio cum aliqua Ecclesia instauratur, tunc primum est illis Verbum occlusum, sed dein recluditur, providente ita Domino, et 
inde {1} discunt quod {2} omnis doctrina fundetur super his duobus praeceptis quod amandus (o)sit Dominus supra omnia, et proximus sicut ipse; quando haec duo praecepta pro fine sunt, tunc reclusum 
est Verbum, omnis enim Lex, et omnes Prophetae, hoc est, totum Verbum, (o)sic ab illis dependent, adeo {3} ut omnia inde sint, et sic ut omnia ad illa se referant; et quia {4} tunc in principiis 
veri et boni {5} sunt, illustrantur in singulis quae in Verbo vident; Dominus enim per angelos tunc est apud illos, et illos tametsi nesciunt, docet, et quoque in vitam veri et boni ducit; [2] hoc 
quoque constare potest ab omnibus Ecclesiis quod tales fuerint in infantia sua, et quod coluerint Dominum ex amore et amaverint proximum ex corde; at temporis successu Ecclesiae ab his binis praeceptis 
se removent, et a bono amoris et charitatis deflectunt ad illa quae fidei vocantur, ita a vita ad doctrinam, et quantum hoc fit, tantum occluditur Verbum; haec sunt quae significantur per illa 
verba in sensu interno `Ecce puteus in agro, et ecce ibi tres catervae gregis cubantes juxta illum, quia e puteo illo potarunt catervas, et lapis magnus super ore putei: et colligebantur illuc omnes 
catervae, et devolvebant lapidem a super ore putei, et potabant gregem, et reducebant lapidem super os putei ad locum suum.' @1 discit$ @2 i omnis cultus Divinus et$ @3 ac ita dependent$ @4 sic$ @5 si tunc$ </p>
