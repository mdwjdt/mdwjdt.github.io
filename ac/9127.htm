<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9127节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9127.</strong>“就为他没有流血的罪”表那么他不会犯有所施暴行的罪。这从“血”的含义清楚可知，“血”在至高意义上是指从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，在源于至高意义的内义上是指良善之真理（参看<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6378.htm">6378</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>，<a href="7846.htm">7846</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="7877.htm">7877</a>节）。因此，“流血”表示向神之真理或良善之真理，以及良善本身施暴。事实上，凡向真理施暴的，同样向良善施暴，因为真理与良善结合得如此紧密，以致这一个属于那一个，或说这一个永远不会离开那一个。因此，向这一个施暴，就是向那一个施暴。由此明显可知，“为他没有流血的罪”表示他不会犯有向真理或良善所施暴行的罪。<br />人若对圣言的内义一无所知，只能认为圣言中的“血”表示血液；“流血”仅仅表示杀人。但内义并不论述人的肉体生命，只论述其灵魂的生命，也就是他的属灵生命，这生命会永远活着。在圣言的字义上，这生命通过诸如构成肉体生命的那类事物来描述，即肉和血。由于人的属灵生命源于属于仁爱的良善和属于信仰的真理，并靠它们来维持，所以在圣言的内义上，“肉”表示属于仁爱的良善，“血”表示属于信仰的真理。在更内在的意义上，“肉”表示属于对主之爱的良善，“血”表示属于对邻之爱的良善。但在唯独论述主的至高意义上，“肉”是指主的神性良善，因而是指神性良善方面的主自己；而“血”是指从主发出的神性真理，因而是指神性真理方面的主。当一个人阅读圣言时，“肉和血”在天上就被理解为这些事物。当这个人参加圣餐礼时，同样理解为这些事物，只是在圣餐中，饼是肉，酒是血，因为“饼”与“肉”所表相同，“酒”与“血”所表相同。<br />但那些像当今大多数世人那样在感官层进行思考的人，根本不理解这一切。所以只要他们相信圣餐和圣言因来自神而含有某种神圣之物在里面，就让他们持守自己的信仰吧。就算他们不知道这种神圣在哪里；还是让那些被赋予某种内在觉知，也就是能在高于感官的层面上进行思考的人考虑一下，在以下经文中，“血”是用来表示血，“肉”是用来表示肉吗？<br />人子啊，主耶和华如此说：你要对天上的各种鸟和田野的各种走兽说：你们聚集来吧！要从四方聚集来吃我为你们所献的祭物，就是在以色列山上所献的大祭物，好叫你们吃肉喝血。你们要吃勇士的肉，喝地上首领的血。你们要从我为你们所献的祭物中喝血喝到醉。你们要在我席上因马匹和战车，并勇士和一切的战士而饱足。我要这样将我的荣耀立在列族中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.17.htm">39:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>）<br />启示录：<br />我又看见一位天使站在日头中，向飞在空中的一切鸟大声呼喊说，你们聚集来赴大神的筵席！可以吃君王的肉，千夫长的肉，壮士的肉，马和骑马者的肉，并自主的，为奴的，小的大的，众人的肉。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.17.htm">19:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">18</a>）<br />很明显，在这些经文中，“肉”并非表示肉，“血”并非表示血。这同样适用于约翰福音中主的“肉”和“血”：<br />我所要赐的粮，就是我的肉。我实实在在地告诉你们：你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。吃我肉喝我血的人就有永生，在末日我要叫他复活。我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。吃我肉、喝我血的人住在我里面，我也住在他里面。这就是从天上降下来的粮。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.51.htm">6:51</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.58.htm">58</a>）<br />主的“肉”是指祂的神性之爱的神性良善，祂的“血”是指从祂的神性良善发出的神性真理；这一点从以下事实可以看出来：它们都是滋养一个人的属灵生命的食物。这解释了为何祂接着说“我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的”，又说“这就是从天上降下来的粮”。由于人通过爱和信与主结合，故祂还说：“吃我肉、喝我血的人住在我里面，我也住在他里面”。不过，如前所述，只有那些能在高于身体感官的层面上进行思考的人，尤其那些信主爱主的人才能明白这个问题，因为主把他们从其肉体感官的生命提升到其灵的生命，因而从世界之光提升到天堂之光；在天堂之光中，对物质事物的概念，也就是在心智中通过肉体所获得的印象会逐渐消失。<br />因此，凡知道“血”表示来自主的神之真理的人也能看出在圣言中，“流血”并非表示杀人，或剥夺一个人的肉体生命；而是表示杀害或剥夺他灵魂的生命，也就是摧毁他的属灵生命，这生命就是对主的信和爱。“血”用来论及非法所流的血时，表示因邪恶所生的虚假而被毁的神之真理，这一点从以下经文清楚看出来，以赛亚书：<br />那时，主以审判的灵和洁净的灵，将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷的血从它中间冲走。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.3.htm">4:3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你们的手被血沾染，你们的指头被罪孽沾污。他们的脚奔向邪恶，他们急速流无辜人的血；他们的思想全是恶念。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.3.htm">59:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.7.htm">7</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />并且你的衣襟上有贫穷无辜灵魂的血。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.34.htm">2:34</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />这都因先知的罪恶和祭司的罪孽，他们在耶路撒冷中间流了义人的血。他们在街上瞎逛，又被血玷污；他们不能玷污的东西，竟用衣服触摸了。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.13.htm">4:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />我从你旁边经过，见你滚在血中，就说：你虽在血中，仍可存活；我实在对你说，你虽在血中，仍可存活。我用水洗你，冲去你身上的血，又用油抹你。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.6.htm">16:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.9.htm">9</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />人子啊，你要与这流血的城争辩吗？向她宣布她一切可憎的事。你要说，因你所流人的血，就为有罪；又因你所造的偶像，就被玷污了。看哪！以色列的首领各逞其能，在你中间流人之血。在你中间有好谗谤的人，预备流人的血；在你中间有在山上吃过的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.2.htm">22:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.9.htm">9</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />我要在天上地下显出奇事，有血、有火、有烟柱。日头要变为幽暗，月亮要变为血，都在耶和华大而可畏的日子未到以前。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.30.htm">2:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.31.htm">31</a>）<br />启示录：<br />日头变黑像毛布，满月变得像血。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.12.htm">6:12</a>）<br /><br />第二位天使吹号，就有仿佛火烧着的大山扔在海中，海的三分之一变成血。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.8.htm">8:8</a>）<br /><br />第二位天使把他的香瓶倒在海里，海就变成好像死人的血，海中一切活着的灵魂都死了。第三位天使把他的香瓶倒在江河与众水的泉源里，它们就变成了血。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.3.htm">16:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.4.htm">4</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“血”并非表示所流的人的肉体生命的血，而是表示他的属灵生命的血，也就是神之真理，邪恶所生的虚假就是向它施暴的。马太福音中的“血”所表相同：<br />叫世上所流义人的血，都归到你们身上。从义人亚伯的血起，直到你们在殿和坛中间所杀的撒迦利亚的血为止。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.35.htm">23:35</a>）<br />这些话表示从古时直到现在，犹太人一直对圣言的真理施暴，以致他们根本不愿接受任何内在和天上的真理。所以他们也不接受主。他们流祂的血表示他们对神之真理的完全弃绝，因为主就是神性真理本身，也就是“成了肉身的圣言”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）。在马太福音中，这些话就表示他们对来自主的神之真理的完全弃绝：<br />彼拉多在众人面前洗手，说，流这义人的血，罪不在我，你们承当吧。众人都回答说，祂的血归到我们和我们的子孙身上。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.24.htm">27:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.25.htm">25</a>）<br />这就解释了约翰福音中所描述的以下事件：<br />惟有一个兵拿枪扎祂的肋旁，随即有血和水流出来。那看见的人就作见证，他的见证也是真的；并且他知道自己所说的是真的，叫你们也可以信。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.34.htm">19:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.35.htm">35</a>）<br />水也流出来的原因是，“水”表示外在形式的神之真理，就是构成字义的那种真理。“水”表示真理（参看<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>节）。<br />由此也明显可知被主的宝血洗净是什么意思，即从主领受信之真理（<a href="7918.htm">7918</a>，<a href="9088.htm">9088</a>节）。由此也明显可知启示录中的这些话是什么意思：<br />他们胜过那龙，是因羔羊的血，和他们所见证的圣言。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.11.htm">12:11</a>）<br />“因羔羊的血”是指通过来自主的神性真理，神性真理也是“他们所见证的圣言”。“羔羊的血”是指纯真之血，因为“羔羊”表示纯真（<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="7840.htm">7840</a>节）。在天上，从主发出的神之真理含有纯真在它的核心处；因为它只感染那些拥有纯真的人，或说，除了那些拥有纯真的人外，没有人对它拥有任何感觉（<a href="2526.htm">2526</a>，<a href="2780.htm">2780</a>，<a href="3111.htm">3111</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>，<a href="6013.htm">6013</a>，<a

Bloods shall not be shed for him. That this signifies that he is not guilty of the violence that is done, is evident from the signification of "blood," as being in the supreme sense the Divine truth 
proceeding from the Lord's Divine good, and in the internal sense thence derived, the truth of good (see n. 4735, 6378, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7846, 7850, 7877). Wherefore by "shedding blood" is signified 
doing violence to truth Divine, or to the truth of good, and also to good itself. For he who does violence to truth does violence likewise to good, because truth has been so conjoined with good that the 
one belongs to the other; and therefore if violence is done to the one, it is done to the other also. From this it is plain that by "bloods not being shed for him" is signified that he is not guilty 
of violence done to truth and good. [2] He who knows nothing of the internal sense of the Word, knows no otherwise than that by "bloods" in the Word are signified bloods; and that by "shedding blood" 
is merely signified killing a man. But the internal sense does not treat of the life of man's body, but of the life of his soul, that is, of his spiritual life, which he is to live forever. This life 
is described in the Word in the sense of the letter by such things as belong to the life of the body; namely, by the flesh and blood. And because the spiritual life of man exists and subsists through 
the good which is of charity and the truth which is of faith, therefore in the internal sense of the Word the good which is of charity is meant by "flesh," and the truth which is of faith is meant 
by "blood." And in a still more interior sense, the good which is of love to the Lord is meant by "flesh," and the good of love toward the neighbor is meant by "blood." But in the supreme sense, which 
treats of the Lord alone, "flesh" denotes the Divine good of the Lord, thus the Lord Himself as to Divine good; and "blood" denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Lord as to Divine 
truth. These things are understood in heaven by "flesh and blood" when a man is reading the Word; in like manner when he attends the Holy Supper; but in this the bread is the flesh, and the wine is 
the blood, because by "bread" the same is signified as by "flesh," and by "wine" the same as by "blood."  [3] But this is not apprehended by those who are sensuous, as is the case with most men in the 
world at this day; and therefore let them remain in their own faith, provided they believe that in the Holy Supper, and in the Word, there is something holy, because from the Divine. Granting that 
they do not know wherein this holiness consists, nevertheless let those who are endowed with any interior perception (that is, who are able to think above the things of sense), consider whether blood 
is meant by "blood," and flesh by "flesh," in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovih; Say to every bird of the heaven, to every wild animal of the field, Assemble yourselves, 
and come; gather yourselves from every side upon My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the 
flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; and ye shall drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice which I will sacrifice for you. Ye shall be sated at My table with the 
horse and the chariot, and with the strong one, and with every man of war. Thus will I set My glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17-21).      I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a 
loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God, that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the 
flesh of the strong ones, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all; free and bond, small and great (Rev. 19:17-18). It is very clear that in these passages by "flesh" 
is not meant flesh, and by "blood" is not meant blood. [4] In like manner then with the "flesh and blood" of the Lord, in the following passage in John: </p>
<p>     The bread that I will give is My flesh. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye shall not have life in you. He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and 
I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him. This is the bread that came 
down from heaven (John 6:51-58). That the Lord's "flesh" denotes the Divine good of His Divine love; and that His "blood" denotes the Divine truth proceeding from His Divine good; can be seen from 
the fact that these are what nourish the spiritual life of a man. From this also it is said, "My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed;" and also, "this is the bread that came down from 
heaven." And as man is conjoined with the Lord through love and faith, it is also said, "he that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him." But as before said those alone apprehend 
this saying who can think above the sensuous things of the body; especially those who are in faith and in love to the Lord, for these are raised by the Lord from the life of the sensuous things 
of the body toward the life of their spirit; thus from the light of the world into the light of heaven, in which light those material things which are in the thought from the body disappear.  [5] He 
therefore who knows that "blood" denotes truth Divine from the Lord, is also able to know that by "shedding blood" in the Word is not signified killing, or depriving a man of the life of the body; but 
killing or depriving him of the life of the soul, that is, destroying his spiritual life, which is from faith in and love to the Lord. That "blood," when understood as being shed unlawfully, denotes 
truth Divine destroyed by means of falsities from evil, is clear from the following passages: </p>
<p>     When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have washed away 
the bloods of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of cleansing (Isa. 4:4).      Your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Their feet 
run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity (Isa. 59:3, 7).      Also in thy skirts is found the blood of poor innocent souls (Jer. 2:34).   
   Because of the sins of the prophets, the iniquities of the priests, that shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of Jerusalem, they have wandered blind in the streets, they are defiled with blood; 
the things which they cannot [defile], they touch with their garments (Lam. 4:13-14).      I passed by thee, and saw thee trodden down in thy bloods, and I said, In thy bloods live; I washed thee 
with waters, and I washed away thy bloods from upon thee, and I anointed thee with oil (Ezek. 16:6, 9).      Thou, son of man, wilt thou plead with the city of bloods? Make known to her all her abominations. 
And thou shalt say, Thou art become guilty through thy blood which thou hast shed, and art defiled through thine idols which thou hast made. Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according 
to His arm, have been in thee, and have shed blood. Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains (Ezek. 22:2, 4, 6, 9).      I will set wonders in 
the heaven and in the earth, blood, and fire, and a pillar of smoke. The sun shall be turned into thick darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day come (Joel 2:30-31).      
The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood (Rev. 6:12).      The second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and 
the third part of the sea became blood (Rev. 8:8).      The second angel poured out his vial into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man, whence every living soul died in the sea. The third angel 
poured out his vial into the rivers, and into the fountains of waters, and they became blood (Rev. 16:3-4). [6] In these passages by "blood" is not meant the blood of man's bodily life that is shed, 
but the blood of his spiritual life, which is truth Divine, to which violence has been done through falsity from evil. The like is meant by "blood" in Matthew: </p>
<p>Upon you shall come the righteous blood 
shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zachariah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar (Matt. 23:35); </p>
<p>by which is signified that the truths of the Word 
have had violence done to them by the Jews, from the earliest time even to the present, insomuch that they would not acknowledge anything of internal and heavenly truth. Therefore neither did they acknowledge 
the Lord. Their "shedding His blood" signified the complete rejection of truth Divine, for the Lord was Divine truth itself, which is "the Word made flesh" (John 1:1, 14). The complete rejection 
of truth Divine which was from the Lord, and which was the Lord, is meant by these Words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Pilate washed his hands before the people, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just 
man; see ye to it. And all the people answered, His, blood be on us, and on our children (Matt. 27:24-25). Therefore this subject is thus described in John: </p>
<p>     One of the soldiers with a spear 
pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water. He that saw bare witness, and his witness is true; and he knoweth that he saith true things, that ye may believe (John 19:34-35); </p>
<p>that 
water also came out was because by "water" is signified external truth Divine, such as is the Word in the letter (that "water" denotes truth, see n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 8568). [7] From all 
this also it is evident what is signified by being purified "by the blood of the Lord," namely, that it is through the reception of the truth of faith from Him (n. 7918, 9088). So also it is plain what 
is signified by these words in John: </p>
<p>     They overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of His testimony (Rev. 12:11); </p>
<p>"by the blood of the Lamb" denotes through the Divine 
truth which is from the Lord, which is also "the Word of His testimony." "The blood of the Lamb" denotes innocent blood, for "a lamb" denotes innocence (n. 3519, 3994, 7840). The truth Divine that proceeds 
from the Lord in heaven has innocence inmostly within it, for it affects no others than those who are in innocence (n. 2526, 2780, 3111, 3183, 3494, 3994, 4797, 6013, 6107, 6765, 7836, 7840, 7877, 7902). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9127</b></p><p><b>9127.</b>
'There shall be no bloodguilt for him' means that he is not guilty of the violence done. This is clear from the meaning of 'blood' in the highest sense as Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine 
Good, and in the internal sense springing from this as the truth of good, dealt with in <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6378.htm">6378</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7846.htm">7846</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="7877.htm">7877</a>. Consequently 'shedding blood' means doing violence to God's truth 
or the truth of good, and also to good itself. For anyone who does violence to truth does it also to good, since truth is wedded so closely to good that one is never without the other. Therefore if 
violence is done to one it is also done to the other. From all this it is evident that 'there shall be no bloodguilt for him' means not being guilty of the violence done to truth or to good.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
A person who has no knowledge of the internal sense of the Word can only think that 'blood' in the Word means blood, and that 'shedding blood' simply means killing someone. But the internal sense does 
not deal with the life of a person's body, only with that of his soul, that is, with his spiritual life, which will go on living forever. This life is described in the Word, in the sense of the letter, 
by means of such things as constitute the life of the body, namely flesh and blood. And since a person's spiritual life springs from and is maintained by the good that belongs to charity and the truth 
that belongs to faith, the good belonging to charity is meant in the internal sense of the Word by 'flesh' and the truth belonging to faith by 'blood'. In an even more internal sense the good belonging 
to love to the Lord is meant by 'flesh' and the good belonging to love towards the neighbour by 'blood'. In the highest sense however, in which solely the Lord is the subject, 'flesh' is the Lord's 
Divine Good, thus the Lord Himself in respect of Divine Good, while 'blood' is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, thus the Lord in respect of Divine Truth. These things are understood in heaven 
by flesh and blood when a person reads the Word. And the same things are understood when the person attends the Holy Supper, though in this the bread is the flesh and the wine is the blood; for 'the 
bread' has exactly the same meaning as flesh and 'the wine' exactly the same meaning as blood.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those who think only on the level of the senses, as most people in the world do at the present 
day, do not understand any of this. Therefore let them keep to the faith they have, so long as they believe that the Holy Supper and the Word have a holiness within them because they come from God. 
Maybe they do not know where that holiness lies; even so, let those who are endowed with some inner degree of perception, that is, who can think on a level above the senses, consider whether 'blood' 
is used to mean blood and 'flesh' to mean flesh in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovih, Say to every bird of the air, to every wild animal of the field, Assemble and come, gather yourselves 
from all around to My sacrifice which I am sacrificing for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood. You will eat the flesh of the mighty, and 
[drink] the blood of the princes of the earth. And you will drink blood till you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I will sacrifice for you. You will be glutted at My table with horse and chariot, 
and with the mighty, and with every man of war. Thus will I set My glory among the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2039:17-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 39:17-21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Also in John, in Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw an angel standing in the sun, who called out with 
a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying in the middle of heaven, Gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God, so that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and 
the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and those seated on them, and the flesh of all, free men and slaves, small and great. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:17, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that in these places 'flesh' 
is not used to mean flesh or 'blood' to mean blood.  The same applies then to the Lord's 'flesh' and 'blood' in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The bread which I shall give is My flesh. Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless 
you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood you will have no life in you. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is 
truly food, and My blood is truly drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. This is the bread which came down from heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:50-58&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:50-58</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord's flesh is the 
Divine Good of His Divine Love, and His blood is Divine Truth emanating from His Divine Good. This may be recognized from the consideration that they are the food which nourishes a person's spiritual 
life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This explains why He goes on to say, 'My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink', and also, 'This is the bread which came down from heaven'. And since a person is joined to the 
Lord through love and faith, He also says, 'He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him'. But as stated above, this matter can be understood only by those who are able to think 
on a level above the bodily senses, in particular by those who believe in and love the Lord, because the Lord raises them from the life of their bodily senses up to the life of their spirit. That is, 
He raises them from the light of the world into the light of heaven, the light in which conceptions of things that are material, that is, impressions in the mind that are acquired by the body fade 
from view.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Anyone therefore who knows that 'blood' means God's truth coming from the Lord can also see that 'shedding blood' in the Word does not mean killing or taking a person's physical life 
but killing or taking the life of his soul, that is, destroying his spiritual life, which consists of faith in and love to the Lord. When 'blood' is used to refer to blood shed unlawfully it means God's 
truth destroyed by falsities arising from evil, as is evident in the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
When the Lord will have washed the excrement of the daughters of Zion and washed away the blood<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgement and by a spirit of purging ... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%204:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 4:4</a>.

<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In these places 'blood' is not used to mean the life-blood of the human body when it has been shed, but the blood of spiritual life, which is God's 
truth, when violence has been done to it by falsity arising from evil. 'Blood' has a similar meaning in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
On you will come the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous 
Abel even to the blood of Zechariah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2023:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 23:35</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These words mean that from earliest times down to the present the Jews had been doing violence 
to the truths of the Word, to such an extent that they were unwilling to accept any inner, heavenly truth at all. Therefore they did not accept the Lord either. The shedding of His blood by them was 
a sign of their total rejection of God's truth; for the Lord was Divine Truth itself, which is the Word made flesh, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
Their total rejection of God's truth that came from the Lord and was 
the Lord is meant by the following in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Pilate washed his hands before the people, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person; you yourselves see [to it]. And answering, 
all the people said, His blood be on us and on our children. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2027:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 27:24, 25</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This accounts for the following incident described in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and 
immediately blood and water came out. He who has seen has testified, and the testimony is true; and he knows that he is saying things that are true, so that you may believe. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2019:34,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 19:34, 35</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The reason 
why water also came out is that 'water' means God's truth in its outward form, the kind of truth that the letter consists of. For the meaning of 'water' as truth, see <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, 
<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 All this also shows what is meant by being made pure by the Lord's blood, namely accepting the truth of faith from Him, <a href="7918.htm">7918</a>, <a href="9088.htm">9088</a>. Thus it also shows what is meant by the following in 
John, in Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
They conquered the dragon by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> testimony. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The blood of the Lamb' is Divine Truth that comes from the Lord, as 
also is 'the word of their testimony'. 'The blood of the lamb' is innocent blood, for 'a lamb' means innocence, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>, <a href="7840.htm">7840</a>. God's truth emanating from the Lord in heaven has innocence at the centre

`Non illi sanguines': quod significet non reum violentiae illatae, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' quod in supremo sensu sit Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini, ac in sensu interno inde, 
verum boni, de qua n. 4735, (x)6378, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7846, 7850, 7877; quare per `effundere sanguinem' significatur violentiam inferre vero Divino, seu vero boni {5}, et quoque ipsi bono; nam qui 
violentiam infert vero, is quoque violentiam infert bono, quoniam verum ita conjunctum est cum bono ut unum sit alterius, quapropter si violentia infertur uni {6} etiam infertur alteri; ex his patet 
quod per `non illi sanguines' significetur non reum esse violentiae illatae vero ac bono. 	[2] Qui de sensu interno Verbi nihil novit, non aliter scit quam quod per `sanguines' in Verbo significentur 
sanguines, et quod per `effundere sanguinem' modo significetur occidere hominem; sed in sensu interno non agitur de vita corporis sed de vita animae hominis, hoc est, de vita (x)spirituali ejus, quam 
victurus est in aeternum; haec vita describitur in Verbo in sensu litterae per talia quae sunt vitae corporis, nempe per `carnem et sanguinem'; et quia vita spiritualis hominis existit et subsistit 
per bonum quod charitatis et per verum quod fidei, idcirco bonum quod charitatis intelligitur per `carnem,' et verum quod fidei per `sanguinem,' in sensu interno Verbi; et in adhuc interiore sensu, bonum 
quod amoris in Dominum per `carnem,' et bonum amoris erga proximum per `sanguinem'; in supremo autem sensu, in quo (o)solum agitur de Domino, `caro' est Divinum Bonum Domini, ita Ipse Dominus quoad 
Divinum Bonum, et `sanguis' est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, ita Dominus quoad Divinum Verum; haec per carnem et sanguinem intelliguntur in caelo cum homo legit Verbum; similiter cum homo obit 
Sanctam Cenam, sed in hac panis est caro, et sanguis est vinum, quoniam per `panem' prorsus simile significatur quod per carnem, et per `vinum' prorsus simile quod per sanguinem. 	[3] Sed qui sensuales 
sunt, ut plerique homines in orbe {7} hodie, hoc non capiunt; maneant itaque in sua fide, modo credant quod in Sacra Cena ac in Verbo sanctum sit {8}, quia {9} a Divino; sit quod non sciant ubi id, 
usque qui aliqua perceptione interiore pollent, hoc est, qui supra sensualia cogitare possunt, expendant (x)num sanguis per `sanguinem,' et caro per `carnem,' intelligatur apud Ezechielem, 	Fili hominis 
sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Dic omni avi caeli, omni ferae agri, Congregamini et venite, congregate vos a circuitu super sacrificium Meum quod Ego sacrifico vobis, sacrificium magnum super montibus 
Israelis, ut comedetis carnem et bibatis sanguinem, carnem fortium comedetis et sanguinem principum terrae, et bibetis sanguinem usque ad ebrietatem, de sacrificio Meo quod sacrificabo vobis; satiabimini 
super mensa Mea, equo et curru, et forti, et omni viro belli; sic dabo gloriam Meam inter gentes, xxxix 17-21: </p>
<p>tum apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, 	Vidi angelum stantem in sole, qui clamavit voce 
magna, dicens omnibus avibus volantibus in medio caeli, Congregamini ad cenam magni Dei, ut comedetis carnes (x)regum, et carnes chiliarchorum, et carnes fortium, et carnes equorum, et sedentium super 
illis, et carnes omnium liberorum et servorum, parvorum et magnorum, xix 17, 18; </p>
<p>quod in his locis `caro' non sit caro quae intelligitur, et `sanguis' non sit sanguis, manifeste patet: [4] similiter 
nunc `caro' et `sanguis' Domini apud Johannem, 	Panis quem Ego dabo, caro Mea est; amen, amen, dico vobis, Nisi comederitis carnem Filii hominis, et biberitis Ipsius sanguinem, non habebitis vitam 
in vobis; qui comedit Meam carnem, et bibit Meum sanguinem, habet vitam aeternam, et Ego resuscitabo illum extremo die, nam caro Mea est vere cibus, et sanguis Meus est vere potus; qui comedit Meam carnem, 
et bibit Meum sanguinem, in Me manet et Ego in illo: hic (t)panis est qui e caelo descendit, vi 50-58; </p>
<p>quod caro Domini sit Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Ipsius, et sanguis Divinum Verum procedens 
a Divino Bono Ipsius, constare potest ex eo quod illa sint quae nutriunt vitam spiritualem hominis; inde etiam dicitur, `Caro Mea est vere cibus, et sanguis Meus est vere potus,' et quoque `hic est 
panis qui e caelo descendit'; et quia homo per amorem et fidem conjungitur Domino, ideo etiam dicitur, `Qui comedit Meam carnem, et bibit Meum sanguinem, in Me manet et Ego in illo.'  Sed, ut supra dictum 
est, illi soli hoc verbum capiunt qui supra sensualia corporis possunt cogitare, imprimis qui in fide et in amore in Dominum sunt, nam hi a Domino elevantur a vita sensualium corporis versus vitam 
spiritus sui {10}, ita a luce mundi in lucem caeli, in (m)qua luce materialia quae sunt in cogitatione a corpore, disparantur.(n) 	[5] Qui itaque novit quod sanguis sit verum Divinum a Domino, is 
quoque scire potest quod per `effundere sanguinem' in Verbo non significetur occidere aut {11} privare hominem vita corporis, sed occidere aut {12} privare illum vita animae, hoc est, destruere ejus {13} 
vitam spiritualem, quae est ex fide et amore in Dominum; quod `sanguis' cum intelligitur illegitime effusus, sit verum Divinum destructum per falsa ex malo {14}, patet ex sequentibus his locis: apud 
Esaiam, 	Cum Dominus laverit excrementum filiarum Zionis, et sanguines Hierosolymae abluerit e medio ejus, per spiritum judicii, et per spiritum expurgationis, iv 4: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Manus vestrae 
pollutae sunt sanguine, et digiti vestri iniquitate; pedes eorum ad malum currunt, et festinant ad effundendum sanguinem innocentem, cogitationes eorum cogitationes iniquitatis, lix [3,] 7: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Etiam 
in alis tuis inventi sunt (x)sanguis {15} animarum pauperum innocentium, ii 34: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ob peccata prophetarum, iniquitates sacerdotum, effundentium in medio Hierosolymae sanguinem 
justorum, errarunt caeci in plateis, polluti sunt sanguine, ea quae non possunt, tangunt vestimentis, Threni iv 13, 14: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Praeterivi praeter te, et vidi te conculcatam in sanguinibus 
tuis; et dixi, In sanguinibus tuis vive; etiam dixi tibi, In sanguinibus tuis vive; lavi te aquis, et ablui sanguines tuos a super te, et unxi te oleo, xvi 6, 9: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Tu, fili hominis, 
num disceptabis cum urbe sanguinum? notifica illi omnes abominationes ejus; per sanguinem tuum quem effudisti, rea facta es, et per idola quae fecisti, polluta es; ecce principes Israelis, quisque juxta 
brachium suum, fuerunt in te, et effuderunt sanguinem; viri calumniae fuerunt in te, ad (x)effundendum sanguinem, et ad montes comederunt in te, xxii 2-4, 6, 9: </p>
<p>apud Joelem, 	Dabo prodigia in caelo 
et in terra, sanguinem et ignem et columnam fumi; sol vertetur in caliginem et luna in sanguinem antequam venit dies magnus et terribilis, (o)iii 3, 4 [A. V. ii 30, 31]: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem, 	Sol factus 
est niger sicut saccus pilosus, et luna tota facta est sicut sanguis, Apoc. (x)vi 12: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Secundus angelus clanxit, et quasi mons magnus igne ardens projectus est in mare, factaque est 
tertia pars maris sanguis, Apoc. viii 8: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Secundus angelus effudit phialam suam in mare, et factum est sanguis sicut mortui, unde omnis anima vivens mortua est in mari. Tertius angelus 
effudit phialam suam in fluvios et in fontes aquarum, et factus est sanguis, Apoc. xvi 3, 4; </p>
<p>[6] in illis locis per `sanguinem' non intelligitur sanguis vitae corporeae hominis qui effusus, sed sanguis 
vitae spiritualis, qui est verum Divinum {16}, cui violentia illata est per falsum ex malo {17}; simile per `sanguinem' (o)intelligitur apud Matthaeum, 	Veniet super vos sanguis justus effusus super 
terram, a sanguine Abelis justi usque ad sanguinem Sachariae, quem occidistis inter templum et altare, xxiii 35; </p>
<p>per quae significatur quod vera Verbi a Judaeis violata fuerint a primo tempore usque 
ad praesens, in tantum ut nihil veri interni ac caelestis agnoscere vellent; ideo nec agnoverunt Dominum; quod effuderint Ipsius sanguinem, significabat plenariam rejectionem {18} veri Divini, Dominus 
enim erat ipsum Divinum Verum, quod est Verbum (m) {19} caro factum, Joh. i 1, 14; (o)rejectio plenaria veri Divini quod a Domino, et quod erat Dominus, {20} intelligitur per haec apud (x)Matthaeum, 	Pilatus 
abluit manus coram populo, dicens, Innocens sum in sanguine justi hujus, vos videritis; et respondens totus populus dixit, Sanguis ejus super nobis et super liberis nostris, (x)xxvii 24, 
25; </p>
<p>propterea hoc describitur ita apud (x)Johannem,(n) 	Unus militum lancea Ipsius latus fodit, et statim exivit sanguis et aqua; qui vidit testatus est, et verum est testimonium, et ille novit quod 
vera dicat, ut vos credatis, xix 34, 35; </p>
<p>quod etiam aqua (o)exivit, est quia per `aquam' significatur verum Divinum externum, quale est Verbum in littera; quod `aqua' sit verum, videatur n. 2702, 
3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 8568. 	[7] Ex his etiam patet quid significatur per purificari per sanguinem Domini, quod sit per receptionem veri fidei ab Ipso {21}, (o)n. 791, (x)9088; ita quoque patet quid 
significatur per haec apud Johannem (o)in Apocalypsi, 	Vicerunt draconem per sanguinem Agni, et per verbum testimonii Ipsius, {22} xii 11; </p>
<p>per `sanguinem Agni' est per Divinum Verum quod a Domino, 
quod etiam est `verbum testimonii'; `sanguis Agni' est sanguis innocens, nam `agnus' est innocentia, n. 3519, (a)3994, 7840; verum Divinum procedens a Domino in caelo {23} intime in se habet innocentiam, 
nam non alios quam qui in innocentia sunt afficit, n. 2526, 2780, 3111, 3183, 3495, 3994, 4797, 6013, 6107, 6765, 7836 fin., 7840, 7902, 7877. @1 ac$ @2 Before Si inveniendo$ @3 vel pecus, ibi
