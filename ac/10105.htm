<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10105节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10105</strong>.“在圣处煮它的肉”表运用在从主获得的光中所看见的教义真理去为生活的功用而预备良善。这从“煮”、“肉”和“圣处”的含义清楚可知：“煮”是指运用教义的真理去为生活的功用进行预备；“肉”是指良善（参看<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>节）；“圣处”是指出于神性启示或光照（译注：另一版本，感谢神性启示或光照）。因为“圣处（或圣地）”是指主的神性存在之地，因而当应用于教义的真理时，是指神性启示或光照存在之地；因为哪里有主的神性存在，哪里就有启示或光照。“煮祭牲的肉”之所以表示运用教义的真理去为生活的功用而预备良善，是因为表示良善的肉通过这种方式为身体的功用而得以预备；因此，在灵义上表示为了生活的功用而得以预备。预备良善是通过教义的真理实现的，这是显而易见的；因为这些真理所教导的，正是功用。此外，煮肉的“水”表示真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>，<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>节）。<br />之所以说运用在从主获得的光中所看见的教义真理，是因为取自圣言的真理要汇集成教义，以便它们投入使用。这种汇集必须由那些处于来自主的光照之人完成；阅读圣言时被如此光照的，是那些为了真理本身和生活良善的缘故而渴慕真理的人，而不是那些为了自我荣耀、名利的缘故而渴慕真理的人。教义必须完全取自圣言，好叫圣言可以被人理解（参看<a href="9025.htm">9025</a>，<a href="9409.htm">9409</a>，<a href="9410.htm">9410</a>，<a href="9424.htm">9424</a>，<a href="9430.htm">9430</a>节）；那些从圣言搜集教义的人必须处于来自主的光照（<a href="9382.htm">9382</a>，<a href="9424.htm">9424</a>节）。<br />“用水煮”表示将真理转化为教义，由此为了生活的功用而预备它们，这一点乍一看，似乎不合情理，很是牵强。然而，这的确是它的意思，这从圣言中论及“用水煮”，以及煮所用的“锅”的经文明显看出来；如列王纪下：<br />以利沙又来到吉甲，那地正有饥荒。先知门徒坐在他面前，他对仆人说，支起大锅，给先知门徒煮汤。有一个人出去到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就从上头去摘野瓜，切了搁在煮汤的锅中。他们在吃汤的时候，都喊叫说，神人啊，锅中有致死之物！他说，拿点面来。就把面撒在锅中说，给众人倒出来，叫他们吃吧！锅中就没有毒物了。（列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下4.38.htm">4:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下4.42.htm">42</a>）<br />这个奇迹和圣言中的其它一切奇迹一样，含有教会的神圣事物在里面，这些神圣事物通过内义变得显而易见。内义表明以利沙代表圣言方面的主，和以利亚一样；“先知门徒”是指那些教导取自圣言的真理之人；按以利沙的吩咐支起的“锅”是指由它们所形成的教义；“野瓜藤”和它上面的“野瓜”是指虚假；由此明显可知，“锅中致死之物”表示什么。他撒在锅中的“面”是指源于良善的真理，由于教义被这种真理修正、治愈，所以“锅中就没有毒物了”。内义还表明，“在锅里煮”表示整理成教义，由此为了功用而预备。圣言中的一切奇迹都含有教会的神圣事物在里面（参看<a href="7337.htm">7337</a>，<a href="8364.htm">8364</a>，<a href="9086.htm">9086</a>节）；以利沙代表圣言方面的主（<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；“先知”是指真理的教导者，因而在从人抽象出来的意义上是指教义的真理（<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>，<a href="7269.htm">7269</a>节）；“葡萄藤”是指教会的真理，“葡萄”是指它的良善（<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>，<a href="5117.htm">5117</a>，<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节）；因此，“野瓜藤”和“野瓜”是指虚假和邪恶；“面”是指源于良善的信之纯真真理（参看<a href="9995.htm">9995</a>节）；他们所煮的“汤”是指一大堆教义事物，就是诸如犹太人的那种（<a href="3316.htm">3316</a>节）。由此可以推断出“煮”和“锅”分别表示什么。<br />以西结书：<br />要向这悖逆之家设比喻说：支起锅来，放好了，就倒水在其中，将肉块，就是一切肥美的肉块，腿和肩都聚在其中。拿美好的骨头把锅装满，好把骨头煮在其中。主耶和华如此说，祸哉！这流人血的城，就是有锈在里面的锅，其锈未曾除掉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结24.3.htm">24:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结24.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这几节经文描述了就教义而言，圣言是什么样，也就是说，它包含从神性良善发出的神性真理。然后，它们又描述了取自圣言的教义，就是诸如存在于犹太民族当中的那种，充满不洁之物和虚假观念。“锅”是指教义；“腿”、“肩”和“美好的骨头”是指按照先后次序从神性良善发出的神性真理；“流人血的城”是指在犹太民族当中的教义之真理方面的该民族，因而在从民族或人抽象出来的意义上是指毁灭良善的教义；它“里面的锈”是指支持污秽之爱的外在之物，这些事物若不除去，就会玷污真理。由此也明显可知，“锅”是指教义，“煮”是指为功用而预备。<br />同一先知书：<br />圣灵对我说，人子啊，这些就是图谋罪孽、在这城中设恶谋的人，说，盖房屋的时候尚未临近，这城是锅，我们是肉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.2.htm">11:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处“锅”也表示由邪恶所产生的虚假构成的教义；因为“锅”用来描述图谋罪孽、高恶谋所在的城。“城”也表示教义（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节），在此表示这类教义。<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，你看见什么？我说，我看见一个烧开的锅，它面朝北。耶和华说，必有灾祸从北方向这地的一切居民打开。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.13.htm">1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“一个烧开的锅”也表示由邪恶所产生的虚假构成的教义；“北”表示就信之真理而言，一种模糊的状态，以及由虚假所造成的幽暗（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。由此明显可知，先知的这个异象包含什么在里面。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />当那日，凡耶路撒冷和犹大的锅，都必归万军之耶和华为圣，凡献祭的都必来取这锅，用它煮。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.21.htm">14:21</a>）<br />此处“锅”表示仁与信的教义，因而表示源于良善的真理的教义；“耶路撒冷”是指主的教会；“凡献祭的”是指那些进行神性敬拜的人。由此明显可知“用锅煮”表示为了属灵生活的而预备。<br />利未记：<br />凡煮罪愆祭和赎罪祭之肉的陶器都要打碎；若是煮在铜器里，这铜器要擦亮，在水中涮净。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.28.htm">6:28</a>）<br />用来煮的“陶器”是指与良善不一致的虚假；“铜器”是指拥有良善在里面的教义事物；在它们里面“煮”罪愆祭和赎罪祭的肉表示为从邪恶和由此而来的虚假中洁净而预备某种东西。由此明显可知这一命令代表什么，即：凡陶器都要打碎；铜器要擦亮，在水中涮净。</p>

And boil the flesh in a holy place. That this signifies the preparation of good for the uses of life through the truths of doctrine in enlightenment from the Lord, is evident from the signification of 
"boiling," as being to prepare for the use of life by means of the truths of doctrine; from the signification of "flesh," as being good (see n. 7850, 9127); and from the signification of "in a holy 
place," as being from Divine enlightenment; for "a holy place" denotes where the Divine of the Lord is present, thus as applied to the truths of doctrine, where there is Divine enlightenment; because 
where the Divine of the Lord is present, there is enlightenment. That to "boil the flesh of the sacrifice" denotes to prepare good for the use of life by means of the truth of doctrine, is because flesh, 
by which is signified good, is thus prepared for the use of the body, consequently in the spiritual sense for the use of life. That the preparation is effected by means of the truths of doctrine, 
is plain, because these teach the use; and moreover by the "waters" in which the boiling is done, are signified truths (n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 5668, 8568, 9323).  [2] It is said by means of truths of doctrine 
in enlightenment from the Lord, because truths from the Word are to be fitted together into doctrine so as to serve for use, which is done by those who are in enlightenment from the Lord; and 
those are in enlightenment when they read the Word, who are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, and for the sake of the good of life, and not those who seek it for the sake of self-glory, 
reputation, or profit, as ends. (That doctrine must be wholly from the Word, so that the Word may be understood, see n. 9025, 9409, 9410, 9424, 9430; and that those who collect doctrine from the Word 
must be in enlightenment from the Word, n. 9382, 9424.) [3] That "to boil in water" denotes to reduce truths into doctrine, and thus prepare them for the use of life, appears at first sight strange 
and farfetched; but that such is nevertheless the signification can be seen from the passages in the Word where "boiling in water" is spoken of, and also where the "pot" is mentioned in which the boiling 
is done; as in the second book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Elisha returned unto Gilgal, when there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his boy, Set on 
the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds, and shred them into the pot of 
pottage. As they were eating of the pottage, they cried out, O man of God there is death in the pot! Wherefore he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people, 
that they may eat. And then there was no evil thing in the pot (2 Kings 4:38-42). This miracle, like all others in the Word, involves holy things of the church, which are opened by means of the 
internal sense. From this it is known that Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word, in like manner as did Elijah; that the "sons of the prophets" denote those who teach truth from the Word; that the 
"pot" which was set on by order of Elisha, denotes the doctrine from it; and that a "wild vine" and the "gourds" from it denote falsities. From this it is plain what is meant by "death in the pot." 
The "meal" which he cast into the pot denotes truth from good, and as the doctrine is amended by this truth, it came to pass that there was no evil thing in the pot. From this also it is plain that "to 
boil in a pot" denotes to collate into doctrine, and thus prepare for use. (That all the miracles in the Word involve holy things of the church, see n. 7337, 8364, 9086; that Elisha represented the 
Lord as to the Word, n. 2762; that the "prophets" denote those who teach truths, thus abstractedly from persons the truth of doctrine, n. 2534, 7269; that a "vine" denotes the truth of the church, and 
"grapes" its good, n. 5113, 5117, 9277; consequently a "wild vine" and "wild gourds" denote falsities and evils; that "meal" denotes the genuine truth of faith from good, see n. 9995; that the "pottage," 
which they were boiling, denotes a heap of doctrinal things, such as was that of the Jews, n. 3316.) From this it can be inferred what is meant by "boiling" and by a "pot." [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>    
 Utter a parable against the rebellious house. Set on the pot, set it on, and also pour water into it; gather the pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill with the choice of 
the bones, and let the bones be boiled in the midst of it. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Woe to the city of bloods, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it (Ezek. 24:3-7); </p>
<p>there 
is here described the Word such as it is as to doctrine, namely, that Divine truths from Divine good are therein; and then is described doctrine from the Word such as it was with the Jewish nation, 
full of unclean things and falsities.  The "pot" denotes doctrine; the "thigh," the "shoulder," and the "choice of the bones," denote Divine truths from Divine good in successive order; the "city 
of bloods" denotes the Jewish nation relatively to the truth of doctrine with them, thus abstractedly from nation or person it denotes the doctrine which destroys good; the "scum" in it denotes what 
is external which favors filthy loves, and which, not being removed, the truth is defiled. From this also it is plain that a "pot" denotes doctrine, and that "to boil" denotes to prepare for use. [5] 
In the same: </p>
<p>     The spirit said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in the city, saying, It is not near to build houses; it is the pot, and 
we are the flesh (Ezek. 11:2, 3); </p>
<p>here also "the pot" denotes the doctrine of falsity from evil, for so the city is called where iniquity is devised, and wicked counsel is given. (That "city" also denotes 
doctrine, see n. 402, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493, here such doctrine.) [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said, What seest thou? I said, I see a pot that is bubbling over, whose face is toward the 
north. Jehovah said, Out of the north shall evil be opened forth upon all the inhabitants of the land (Jer. 1:13, 14); </p>
<p>here also "a pot bubbling over" denotes the doctrine of falsity from evil; the 
"north" denotes an obscure state in respect to the truth of faith, and also thick darkness from falsities (n. 3708); from this it is plain what this prophetic vision involves. [7] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>   
  In that day every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to Jehovah Zebaoth, and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and shall boil in them (Zech. 14:21); </p>
<p>here "pot" signifies 
the doctrine of charity and of faith, thus the doctrine of truth from good; "Jerusalem" denotes the church of the Lord; "they who sacrifice" denote those who are in Divine worship. From this it is 
evident that "to boil in pots" denotes to prepare for the use of spiritual life. [8] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Every vessel of pottery in which is boiled the flesh of a sacrifice of guilt and of sin shall be 
broken; but if it hath been boiled in a vessel of brass, this shall be scoured and rinsed in water (Lev. 6:28).      The earthen vessel in which the boiling was done denotes falsity which does not cohere 
with good; "a vessel of brass" denotes a doctrinal matter in which is good; the "boiling" of the flesh of the sacrifice of guilt and sin in them, denotes preparation for purification from evils 
and the falsities thence derived. From this it is evident what was represented by the injunction that every earthen vessel should be broken, and that a vessel of brass should be scoured and rinsed in waters. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10105</b></p><p><b>10105.</b>
'And boil its flesh in a holy place' means employing the truths of doctrine seen in light received from the Lord to make good ready for use in life. This is clear from the meaning of 'boiling' as employing 
the truths of doctrine to make ready for use in life; from the meaning of 'flesh' as good, dealt with in <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>; and from the meaning of 'in a holy place' as thanks to Divine enlightenment. 
For a holy place is one where what is Divine and the Lord's is present, and so, when the expression has specific reference to the truths of doctrine, is one where Divine enlightenment exists; for where 
what is Divine and the Lord's is present, so is enlightenment. The reason why 'boiling the flesh of the sacrifice' means employing the truths of doctrine to make good ready for use in life is that 
flesh, by which good is meant, is by that means made ready for the use of the body; consequently being made ready for use in life is meant in the spiritual sense. The fact that the truths of doctrine 
are what are employed to make good ready is self-evident, for use is what those truths teach. Also 'the water' in which the flesh is boiled means truths, see <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="8568.htm">8568</a>, <a href="9323.htm">9323</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The words 'employing the truths of doctrine seen in light received from the Lord' are used because truths drawn from the Word have to be marshalled into doctrine in order that they may be put to use. 
The marshalling must be done by those who see things in light received from the Lord; and those so enlightened when they read the Word are people who desire truth for its own sake and for the sake of 
goodness of life, not those who desire it for the sake of self-glorification, reputation, or gain. Doctrine drawn from the Word is wholly essential for understanding the Word, see <a href="9025.htm">9025</a>, <a href="9409.htm">9409</a>, <a href="9410.htm">9410</a>, <a href="9424.htm">9424</a>, <a href="9430.htm">9430</a>; and those who gather doctrine from the Word must see things in light received from the Lord, <a href="9382.htm">9382</a>, <a href="9424.htm">9424</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The meaning of 'boiling in water' as turning truths into doctrine and thereby 
making them ready for use in life seems at first sight to be implausible and far-fetched. Nevertheless that is indeed the meaning, as becomes clear from places in the Word where the words 'boiling 
in water' occur, and also where 'a pot' in which the boiling is done is mentioned, as in the second Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>Elisha came again to Gilgal, when there was a famine in the land. When the sons of 
the prophets were sitting before him he said to his servant, Put on a great pot, and boil a soup for the sons of the prophets. One of them went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine, 
and gathered from it wild gourds, and cut them up into the pot of soup. While they were eating of the soup they cried out, There is death in the pot, O man of God! Therefore he said that they should 
bring flour, which he threw into the pot, and said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. Then there was not anything bad in the pot. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 4:38-41.  </p>
<p>This miracle, like all others in the 
Word, holds holy things of the Church within it, which are made evident by the internal sense. This sense shows that Elisha represented the Lord in respect of the Word, as Elijah had done; that 'the 
sons of the prophets' are those who teach truths drawn from the Word; that 'the pot' which was put on at Elisha's command is doctrine formed from them; that 'a wild vine' and 'gourds' from it are falsities; 
and from all this it is evident what 'death in the pot' is. 'The flour which he threw into the pot' is truth springing from good, as a result of which action - because doctrine had been cured - 
'there was not anything bad in the pot'. The internal sense also shows that 'boiling in the pot' means combining into doctrine and thereby making ready for use.  </p>
<p>All miracles in the Word hold holy 
things of the Church within them, see <a href="7337.htm">7337</a>, <a href="8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="9086.htm">9086</a>.  Elisha represented the Lord in respect of the Word, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>.  'Prophets' are teachers of truths, thus in the abstract sense, without reference 
to persons, the truths of doctrine, <a href="2534.htm">2534</a>, <a href="7269.htm">7269</a>.  'Vine' is the Church's truth, and 'grapes' its good, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>, <a href="5117.htm">5117</a>, <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>, so that 'a wild vine' and 'gourds' are falsities and evils.  'Flour' is the authentic 
truth of faith derived from good, <a href="9995.htm">9995</a>.  'The soup' which they were to boil means matters of doctrine massed together, as those of the Jews were, <a href="3316.htm">3316</a>.  </p>
<p>From all this people may deduce what 
'boiling' means, and what 'a pot' means.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel,  </p>
<p>Tell a parable against the house of rebellion: Put on the pot, put it on, and also pour water into it; gather the pieces into it - every 
good piece, the thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with the choice of the bones, and let the bones be boiled in the midst of it. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Woe to the city of blood<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, to the pot whose 
scum is in it, and whose scum does not come out of it! Ezek. 24:3-6.  </p>
<p>These verses describe what the Word is like so far as doctrine is concerned, that is to say, it contains Divine Truths emanating 
from Divine Good. Then they describe doctrine from the Word as it existed among the Jewish nation - full of unclean and false notions. 'The pot' is doctrine; 'the thigh, the shoulder, and the choice 
of the bones' are Divine Truths emanating from Divine Good in successive order; 'the city of blood' is the Jewish nation in respect of the truth of doctrine among them, and in the abstract sense, without 
reference to nation or person, doctrine destructive of good; 'the scum in it' is that which is external and favours foul kinds of love, which if not removed defile truth. From this also it is evident 
that 'the pot' is doctrine, and 'boiling' making ready for use.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<p>The Spirit said to me, Son of man, these men think iniquity and give wicked counsel in the city, 
saying, [The time] is not near to build houses; [the city] itself is the pot and we are the flesh. Ezek. 11:2,<a href="3.htm">3</a>,<a href="7.htm">7</a>.  </p>
<p>Here also 'the pot' stands for doctrine consisting of falsity arising from evil; 
for 'the pot' is used to describe the city in which iniquity is thought and wicked counsel is given. 'The city' too means doctrine, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4492.htm">4492</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, in this instance doctrine of 
the same type.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Jeremiah,  </p>
<p>Jehovah said, What do you see? I said, A puffed-out pot do I see, its face towards the north. Jehovah said, From the north evil will be opened over all the inhabitants 
of the land. Jer. 1:13,<a href="14.htm">14</a>.  </p>
<p>'A puffed-out pot' likewise means doctrine consisting of falsity arising from evil. 'The north' means an obscure state so far as the truth of faith is concerned, 
also thick darkness caused by falsities, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>. From this it is evident what this prophetic vision holds within it.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Zechariah,  </p>
<p>On that day every pot in Jerusalem [and] in Judah will be 
holiness to Jehovah Zebaoth, and all offering sacrifice will come, and take from them, and boil in them. Zech. 14:21.  </p>
<p>Here 'pot' means doctrine teaching about charity and faith, thus doctrine consisting 
of truth springing from good; 'Jerusalem' is the Lord's Church; and '[all] offering sacrifice' are those engaging in Divine worship. From this it is evident that 'boiling in the pots' means making 
ready for use in spiritual life. </p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Moses,  </p>
<p>Every earthen vessel in which the flesh of the sacrifice of a guilt or a sin offering is boiled shall be broken. But if it has been boiled in a

<p>'An earthen vessel' in which the boiling was done is falsity that does not go together with good; 'a bronze vessel' is doctrinal 
teaching that has good in it; 'boiling the flesh of the sacrifice of a guilt or sin offering' in them means making something ready for purification from evils and consequent falsities. From this it 
is evident what was represented by the decree that an earthen vessel should be broken and that a bronze vessel should be scoured and rinsed in water.

`Et coques carnem in loco sancto': quod significet praeparationem boni ad {1} usus vitae per vera doctrinae in illustratione ex Domino, constat ex significatione `coquere' quod sit praeparare ad usum 
vitae per vera doctrinae, ex significatione `carnis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 7850, 9127, et ex significatione `in loco sancto' quod sit ex illustratione Divina, nam locus sanctus est ubi Divinum Domini 
praesens {2} est, ita applicate ad vera doctrinae, ubi illustratio Divina, nam ubi Divinum Domini (t)praesens est, ibi illustratio. quod `coquere carnem sacrificii' sit praeparare bonum ad usum 
vitae per vera doctrinae, est quia caro, per quam significatur bonum, sic praeparatur ad usum (x)corporis, inde in sensu spirituali, ad usum vitae; quod praeparatio fiat per vera doctrinae, patet, quoniam 
illa docent usum; per `aquas' etiam, in quibus fit coctio, significantur vera, videatur n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 5668, 8568, 9323. 	[2] Dicitur per vera doctrinae {3} in illustratione a Domino, quoniam 
vera ex Verbo in doctrinam concinnanda sunt, ut inserviant usui, quod fiet ab illis qui in illustratione sunt a Domino; ac illi in illustratione sunt cum legunt Verbum, qui in affectione veri sunt 
propter verum et propter bonum vitae, et non illi qui propter gloriam sui, famam, {4} aut lucrum, ut {5} finem. Quod doctrina ex Verbo omnino erit ut Verbum intelligatur, videatur n. 9025, 9409, 9410, 
9424, 9430, et {6} qui doctrinam ex Verbo colligent erunt in illustratione a Domino, n. 9382, 9424. 	[3] Quod `coquere in aquis' sit redigere vera in doctrinam et sic praeparare ad usum vitae, apparet 
ad primum aspectum sicut non conforme et sicut distans, sed usque quod ita sit, constare potest ex locis in Verbo ubi `coquere aquis' dicitur, et quoque ubi `olla' in qua coctio, nominatur, ut in 
2 Libro Regum, 	Elisaeus rediit ad Gilgalem cum fames in terra; cum filii prophetarum sederent coram illo, dixit puero suo, Appone ollam magnam, et coque pulmentum filiis prophetarum; exivit unus in 
agrum ad colligendum olera, et invenit vitem agrestem, et collegit de illa (x)colocynthidas agri; et concidit in ollam pulmenti: cum comederent de pulmento, clamabant, Mors in olla, vir Dei; quare dixit 
ut acciperent farinam, quam jecit in ollam, et dixit, Effunde populo ut comedant; tunc non fuit res mala in olla, iv (x)38-42; </p>
<p>hoc miraculum, sicut reliqua in Verbo, involvit sancta Ecclesiae, quae 
patefiunt per sensum internum; ex hoc scitur quod `Elisaeus' repraesentaverit Dominum quoad Verbum, pariter ac Elias, quod `filii prophetarum' sint qui docent vera ex Verbo, quod' `olla,' quae jussu 
Elisaei apponebatur, {7} sit doctrina inde, quod `vitis agrestis' et inde (x) colocynthides" {8} sint falsa; inde patet quid `mors in olla'; `farina quam jecit in ollam' est verum {9} ex bono, ex quo 
quia doctrina emendatur, factum est, quod non esset res mala in olla; inde quoque patet quod `coquere in olla' sit conferre in doctrinam, et sic praeparare ad usum; quod omnia miracula in Verbo involvant 
sancta Ecclesiae, videatur n. 7337, 8364, 9086, quod `Elisaeus' repraesentaverit Dominum quoad Verbum, n. 2762, quod `prophetae' sint docentes vera, ita abstracte a personis vera doctrinae, n. 2534, 
7269, quod `vitis' sit verum Ecclesiae, (c)et `uvae' ejus bonum, n. 5113, 5117, 9277, inde `vitis agrestis' et "colocynthides" sunt falsa et mala; quod `farina' sit verum fidei genuinum ex bono, n. 
9995, quod `pulmentum' quod coquerent, sit congeries doctrinalium, qualis erat Judaeorum, n. 3316; inde concludi potest quid sit `coquere' et quid sit `olla': apud Ezechielem, [4] 	Paraboliza contra 
domum rebellionis parabolam; Apponeollam, appone, etiamque infunde in eam aquas; colligendo frusta in eam, omne frustum bonum, femur et umerum, electione ossium imple, et coquantur ossa in medio ejus: 
sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Vae urbi sanguinum, ollae cujus spuma in ea, et cujus spuma non exit ex ea! xxiv 3-6; </p>
<p>describitur hic Verbum quale est quoad doctrinam {10}, quod nempe ibi sint Divina Vera 
ex Divino Bono; et dein describitur doctrina ex Verbo, qualis erat apud gentem Judaicam quod plena immunditiis et falsis; `olla' est doctrina, `femur, umerus, et electio ossium' sunt Divina Vera ex 
Divino Bono in ordine successivo, urbs sanguinum est gens Judaica respective ad verum doctrinae apud se, ita abstracte a gente seu persona est {11} doctrina quae destruit bonum, spuma in ea' est externum 
favens spurcis amoribus, {12} quo non remoto conspurcatur verum; inde quoque patet quod `olla' sit doctrina, et `coquere' sit praeparare ad usum: apud eundem, [5] 	Spiritus dixit ad me, Fili hominis, 
hi viri cogitant iniquitatem, et consulunt consilium malitiae in urbe, dicentes, Non prope aedificare domos, ipsa olla et nos caro, xi 2, 3, 7; </p>
<p>hic quoque `olla' pro doctrina falsi ex malo, ita 
enim dicitur urbs ubi cogitatur iniquitas et consulitur consilium malitiae; quod etiam `urbs' sit doctrina, videatur' n. 402, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493, hic doctrina talis: apud Jeremiam, [6] 	Jehovah 
dixit, quid tu vides? dixi, Ollam exsufflatam ego video, cujus facies versus septentrionem; dixit Jehovah, A septentrione aperietur malum super omnes habitatores terrae, i 13, 14;  `olla exsufflata' 
etiam hic pro doctrina falsi ex malo; `septentrio' est status obscurus quoad verum fidei, et quoque caligo ex falsis, n. 3708; inde patet quid haec visio prophetica {13} involvit: apud Sachariam, 
[7] 	In die illo erit omnis olla in Hierosolyma [et] in Jehudah sanctitas Jehovae Zebaoth, et venient omnes sacrificantes, et sument de illis, et coquent in illis, xiv 21 ; </p>
<p>hic `olla' significat 
doctrinam charitatis et fidei, ita doctrinam veri ex bono; `Hierosolyma' est Ecclesia Domini, `sacrificantes' sunt qui in cultu Divino {14}; inde patet quod `coquere in ollis' sit praeparare ad usum vitae 
spiritualis: apud Moschen, 	Omne vas testae in quo coquitur caro sacrificii reatus et peccati, frangetur; sed si in vase aeris coctum fuerit, abradetur, et immergetur in aquis, Lev. vi 21 [A.V. 
28]; </p>
<p>`vas testae in quo coctio' est falsum quod non cohaeret cum bono, `vas aeris' est doctrinale in quo bonum, `coctio carnis sacrificii reatus et peccati in illis' est praeparatio ad purificationem 
a malis et inde falsis; inde patet quid repraesentatum est per quod vas testae frangeretur, et quod vas aeris abraderetur et immergeretur aquis. @1 usum altered to usus$ @2 After doctrinae$ @3 ex$ @4
