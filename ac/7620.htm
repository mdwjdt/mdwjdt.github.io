<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7620节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于火星的灵人和居民（续）</h4><br />7620.我看见一道最美丽的火焰，具有各种颜色；它是深红色，从亮白红变成加深的红。这火焰还使它的颜色发光变得漂亮。我还看见一只手，这手不是拿着这火焰；相反，是这火焰贴在手上，先是贴在手背上，之后贴在手掌或掌心上，从那里绕手玩耍。这一切持续了一段时间。然后，这手与火焰一起被移到远处，它们停歇的地方有一片光；这手便消失在这光中。此时，这道火焰变成了一只鸟。一开始，这鸟有着和火焰一样的颜色，同样闪闪发光。但这些颜色逐渐发生改变，随着它们改变，这鸟的生命活力也发生改变。它飞来飞去，先是在我头上盘旋，然后从我面前飞入一个狭窄的房间。它越朝那个方向飞，其生命就越衰退，直到最后它变成石头。起初，它的颜色如珍珠一般，但后来变成黑色；尽管缺乏生气，它仍继续飞行。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH MARS.  I saw a certain most beautiful flame; it was of various colors, crimson, and also from white reddening, and the colors likewise sparkled 
beautifully from the flame. I saw also a certain hand, which did not hold this flame, but to which it adhered, at first on the back part, afterward on the palm or hollow of the hand, and thence 
it played around the hand. This continued for some time. Then the hand together with the flame were removed to a distance, and where they rested, there was light; in this light the hand withdrew, and 
then the flame was changed into a bird, which at first had like colors with the flame, the colors in like manner sparkling. But the colors gradually changed, and with the colors the vigor of life in the 
bird. It flew around, and at first about my head, then forward into a kind of narrow chamber; and as it flew forward, its life in proportion departed, until at last it became stone, at first of the 
color of a pearl, afterward dark; but although devoid of life, it continued flying. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET MARS - continued </p>
<p>I saw a most beautiful flaming object, varying in colour; it was crimson, turning from brilliant white to a deepening red. The flame also made 
its colours glow beautifully. I also saw a hand, which was not holding the flame; rather, the flame clung to the hand. At first it caressed the back of the hand, after that the palm or hollow, and from 
there all around. This went on for some time. The hand together with the flaming object then moved further away, and where it stopped there was a patch of light, into which the hand disappeared. At 
this point the flaming object changed into a bird, which at first possessed colours like those of the flaming object, colours which were likewise sparkling. But those colours gradually changed, and 
as they did so, the vigorous life in the bird changed too. It flew round about, first around my head, and then frontwards from me into something narrow like a cubicle. And the further it flew in that 
direction, the more the life went out of it, till at length it became like a piece of stone. At first its colour was pearly, after that it was dull; but even though devoid of life it continued its flight. </p>

<p>Videbam flammeum quoddam pulcherrimum; erat varii coloris, purpureum, tum ex candido rubescens, colores illi etiam ex flamma pulchre rutilabant 
{1}; quandam etiam manum videbam, quae hoc flammeum non tenuit, sed cui adhaesit; primum inversae ejus parti, postea palmae seu volae, et inde lambebat manum circumcirca; hoc aliquanto tempore perstitit; 
dein manus haec cum flammeo removebatur ad distantiam, et ubi substitit erat lucidum; in lucido illo recessit manus; et tunc flammeum mutabatur in avem, quae principio erat similibus coloribus cum 
flammeo, et colores similiter coruscabant; sed colores illi successive mutati sunt, et cum coloribus {2} vitae vigor in ave; volabat circumcirca, et primum circum caput meum, dein antrorsum in angustum 
quoddam quasi cubiculum; et sicut volabat antrorsum magis, ita vita recessit, et facta est demum {3} lapidea; primum tunc colore margaritico, postea obscuro, sed tametsi absque vita, usque volabat. 	@1
