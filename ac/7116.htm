<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7116.</strong>“他们昨天和前天作砖的数目，你们仍旧加在他们身上”表捏造物和虚假将如同在以前状态下那样大量被引入。这从“数目”、“砖”、“昨天和前天”、“加在他们身上”的含义清楚可知：“数目”是指大量，在此是同样大量；“砖”是指捏造物和虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="7113.htm">7113</a>节）；“昨天和前天”是指以前的状态，如刚才所述（<a href="7114.htm">7114</a>节）；“加在他们身上”是指引入，因为它论及捏造物和虚假。由此明显可知，“他们昨天和前天作砖的数目，你们仍旧加在他们身上”表示捏造物和虚假将如同在以前状态下那样大量被引入。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7116</b></p><p><b>7116.</b>
And the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon them. That this signifies that things fictitious and false must be injected in abundance as in the 
former state, is clear from the signification of "the tale," as being abundance, here the same abundance; from the signification of "bricks," as being things fictitious and false (of which just above, 
n. 7113); from the signification of "yesterday and the day before yesterday," as being the former state (of which also just above, n. 7114); and from the signification of "laying upon them," as being 
to inject, because it is said of things fictitious and false. From all this it is evident that by "laying upon them the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday" is 
signified that things fictitious and false were to be injected in the same abundance as in the former state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7116</b></p><p><b>7116.</b>
'And the tally of bricks which they were making yesterday and the day before shall you impose on them' means that fabrications and falsities are to be introduced in the same abundance as in the previous 
state. This is clear from the meaning of 'the tally' as an abundance, here the same abundance; from the meaning of 'bricks' as fabrications and falsities, dealt with just above in <a href="7113.htm">7113</a>; from the meaning 
of 'yesterday and the day before' as a previous state, also dealt with just above, in <a href="7114.htm">7114</a>; and from the meaning of 'imposing on them' as introducing, since it has reference to fabrications and 
falsities. From all these meanings it is evident that 'the tally of bricks which they were making yesterday and the day before shall you impose on them' means that fabrications and falsities are to be 
introduced in the same abundance as in the previous state. </p>

</p><b>7116.</b>
`Et demensum laterum quod illi facientes heri nudius tertius, ponetis super illos': quod significet quod ficticia et falsa copia qua {1}in statu priore, injicienda, constat ex significatione `demensi' 
quod sit copia, hic copia eadem; ex significatione `laterum' quod sint ficticia et falsa, de qua mox supra n. 7113; ex significatione `heri nudius tertius' quod sit status prior, de qua etiam mox supra 
n. 7114; et ex significatione `ponere super illos' quod sit injicere, quia praedicatur de ficticiis et falsis; ex his patet quod per `demensum laterum quod illi facientes heri nudius tertius, ponetis 
super illos' significetur quod ficticia et falsa copia qua in statu priore, injicienda {2}. 	@1 A first had prius (as n. 7106), then altered to in statu priore$ 	@2 i; sed absque illis scientificis 
de quibus, n. 7112$ </p>
