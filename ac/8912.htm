<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8912节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8912.</strong>还必须简要解释一下此处所提及的不可贪恋的东西在内义上表示什么，即：“房屋”、“妻子”、“仆婢”、“牛”、“驴”。它们都是一个整体中的一切信之良善和真理，都不可从任何人那里夺走，也不可对它们造成伤害。它们也是“守安息日为圣”、“尊敬父母”、“不可杀人”、“不可奸淫”、“不可偷盗”、“不可作假见证”在内义上所表示的事物。如前所示，所有这些事物在内义上都是诸如属于爱和信的那类事物。“房屋（或家）”表示总体上的一切良善；“妻子”表示总体上的一切真理；“仆”表示对属灵真理的情感，“婢”表示对属灵良善的情感；“牛”表示对属世良善的情感，“驴”表示对属世真理的情感。这些就是不可“贪恋”，也就是不可从任何人那里夺走，或不可造成伤害的东西。在内义上之所以表示这些事物，是因为圣言的内义是为了天上的人，因为那里的人不是以属世的方式，而是以属灵的方式来理解圣言。也就是说，他们不将其理解为房屋，妻子，仆婢，牛驴，而是理解为它们所对应的属灵事物，也就是爱之良善和信之真理。简言之，外在意义或字义是为了世人，但内义是为了天上的人，也为了世人，只要他们同时在天堂，也就是只要他们处于仁和信。</p>

It must also be explained briefly what is meant in the internal sense by the things here mentioned, namely, "house," "wife," "manservant," "maidservant," "ox," and "ass," which are not to be coveted. 
They are all the goods and truths of faith in one complex, which are not to be taken away from anyone, and to which no injury is to be done; and they are the same things which in the internal sense are 
signified by "keeping the Sabbath day holy," "honoring father and mother," "not killing," "not committing adultery," "not stealing," "not bearing false witness," all which things have been shown above 
to be in the internal sense such as are of love and faith. By "house" is meant all good in general; by "wife," all truth in general; by "manservant," the affection of spiritual truth; by "maidservant," 
the affection of spiritual good; by "ox," the affection of natural good; and by "ass," the affection of natural truth. These are the things which are "not to be coveted," that is, which are not 
to be taken away from anyone, or to which harm must not be done. That these things are meant in the internal sense, is because the Word in this sense is for those who are in heaven, for those who are 
there do not perceive the Word naturally, but spiritually, thus not house, nor wife, nor manservant, nor maidservant, nor ox, nor ass, but the spiritual things that correspond to them, which are the goods 
of love and the truths of faith. In a word, the external sense or the sense of the letter is for those who are in the world, but the internal sense is for those who are in heaven, and also for those 
who are in the world, yet insofar as they are at the same time in heaven, that is, so far as they are in charity and faith. </p>

A brief explanation must also be given as to what those things mentioned here which must not be coveted are used to mean in the internal sense - 'house', 'wife', 'male slave', 'female slave', 'ox', and 
'ass'. They are all the forms of the good of faith and all the truths of faith in their entirety which must not be taken away from anyone and must not be made to suffer harm. They are the same things 
as are meant in the internal sense by keeping the sabbath day holy, honouring father and mother, not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, and not bearing false witness. All these, as has 
been shown in previous paragraphs, are in the internal sense such things as belong to love and faith. 'House' is used to mean all good in general, 'wife' all truth in general, 'male slave' the affection 
for spiritual truth, 'female slave' the affection for spiritual good, 'ox' the affection for natural good, and 'ass' the affection for natural truth. These are the things that must not be coveted, 
that is, must not be taken away from anyone or made to suffer harm. The reason why these things are meant in the internal sense is that this sense of the Word is for those in heaven; for those there 
do not understand the Word in a natural but in a spiritual way. That is, they do not understand it to mean a house, wife, male slave, female slave, ox, or ass, but the spiritual entities to which they 
correspond, which are forms of the good of love and truths of faith. In short the external or literal sense is for those who are in the world; but the internal sense is for those who are in heaven, and 
also for those who are in the world, yet only so far as they are at the same time in heaven, that is, so far as charity and faith reside with them.

Explicandum etiam est paucis quid per illa quae hic memorantur, nempe per `domum, uxorem, servum, ancillam, bovem, et asinum,' quae non concupiscenda {1}, in sensu interno intelligitur; sunt omnia bona 
et vera fidei in uno complexu, quae non (x)auferenda alicui, ac quibus non damnum inferendum {2}; suntque eadem illa quae in sensu interno significantur per sanctificare diem sabbati, honorare patrem 
et matrem, per non occidere, non adulterari, non furari, non testari false, quae omnia quod sint talia quae sunt amoris et fidei in sensu interno, in praecedentibus ostensum est; per `domum' intelligitur 
omne bonum in genere, per `uxorem' omne verum in genere, per `servum' affectio veri spiritualis, per `ancillam' affectio boni spiritualis, per `bovem' affectio boni naturalis, et per asinum' affectio 
veri naturalis; haec sunt quae non concupiscenda, hoc est, quae non (d)alicui auferenda, aut quibus damnum non inferendum.  Quod haec in sensu interno intelligantur, est quia Verbum in eo sensu 
est pro illis qui in caelo, nam illi qui ibi {3}, Verbum non naturaliter sed spiritualiter percipiunt {4}, ita non domum, non {5} uxorem, nec servum, ancillam, bovem, et asinum, sed spiritualia quae 
illis correspondent quae sunt bona amoris et vera fidei; verbo, {6} sensus externus seu litterae est pro illis qui {3} in mundo, at {7} sensus internus {8} pro illis qui in caelo, etiam pro illis qui 
in mundo, sed quantum simul in caelo sunt, hoc est, quantum in charitate et fide sunt. @1 i sunt$ @2 i apud aliquem$ @3 i sunt$ @4 Verbum non naturaliter seu secundum literam sed spiritualiter percipiunt
