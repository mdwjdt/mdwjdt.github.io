<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9035节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9035.</strong>“以致死在他的手下”表以致它在他的深思之下被消灭。这从“死”和“他的手下”的含义清楚可知：“死”是指被消灭（参看<a href="9026.htm">9026</a>节）；“他的手下”是指在他的深思之下，因为“手”表示属灵真理所拥有的能力 （<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>节），因而表示深思的能力，因为这种能力来自真理，是一种洞察力。事实上，已经存在属世人记忆中的圣言字义真理，在那里可以说形成一块田地，供来自天堂的光所流入的内在人沉思。如前所述，内在人从这块田地拣选诸如与他里面的良善一致的那类事物，就像人的肉眼从一块耕种的田地拣选诸如在那里生长、将来有助于他履行生活上的职责的那类事物一样。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9035</b></p><p><b>9035.</b>
And he die under his hand. That this signifies so that it be extinguished under his view, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being to be extinguished (see above, n. 9026); and from the 
signification of "under his hand," as being under his view, for by "hand" is signified the power which belongs to spiritual truth (n. 5327, 5328, 7011), thus which is of the view, for this is effected 
by virtue of this truth, and is a noticing. For the truths of the literal sense of the Word, stored up in the natural memory of man, form there as it were a field for the view of the internal man, into 
which light from heaven flows. From this field, as before said, the internal man selects such things as agree with the good in him, comparatively as the eye selects from the field of a garden such 
things as conduce to the uses of its life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9035</b></p><p><b>9035.</b>
'And [the slave] dies under his hand' means so that it is wiped out under his contemplation. This is clear from the meaning of 'dying' as being wiped out, as above in <a href="9026.htm">9026</a>; and from the meaning of 'under 
his hand' as under his contemplation, for 'the hand' means the power which spiritual truth possesses, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, thus the power of contemplation, for such power comes from truth and is discernment. 
Truths as stated in the literal sense of the Word which have been stored away in the natural man's memory form so to speak a field there for the contemplation of the internal man into whom light 
from heaven flows. From this field the internal man chooses such things as are in agreement with the good in him, as stated above, just as a person's eye selects from a cultivated field such things 
growing there as will help him to perform his duties in life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9035</b>
</p><b>9035.</b>
`Et moritur sub manu ejus': quod significet ut exstinguatur sub intuitione ejus, constat ex significatione `mori' quod sit exstingui, ut supra n. 9026, et ex significatione `sub manu ejus' quod sit 
sub intuitione, nam per `manum' significatur potentia quae est veri spiritualis, n. (x)5327, 5328, 7011, ita quae est intuitionis, nam intuitio fit ex illo vero et est apperceptio; vera enim sensus litteralis 
Verbi in memoria naturali hominis reposita formant ibi quasi campum pro intuitione interni hominis in quem influit lux e caelo; ex hoc campo eligit internus homo talia quae concordant cum bono 
apud se, ut supra dictum est, comparative sicut oculus ex campo hortensi talia quae conducunt usibus vitae suae. </p>
