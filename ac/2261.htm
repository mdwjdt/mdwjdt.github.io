<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2261节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2261.</strong>“我若在那城当中发现所多玛还有五十个义人”表若真理充满良善。这从“五十”和“那城当中”的含义清楚可知：“五十”是指完满；“那城当中”是指在真理内部或在真理里面，如前面所解释的（<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>节，那里出现了同样的话）。可想而知，若真理充满良善，人必得救。不过，要知道，人所具有的真理极其稀少，即便有，它们也没有任何生命，除非它们里面有良善。若它们里面有良善，他就会得救。不过，他得救是由于怜悯。因为如前所述，人所具有的真理极其稀少，而它们里面的良善则通过真理和此人的生命而得其品质。<br />就本身而言，真理并不赋予生命，赋予生命的是良善。真理只是生命，即良善的接受者。因此，没有人能说他凭真理得救，或如常说的那样，唯信得救，除非良善存在于这真理，也就是信的部分中。这必存在于它们里面的良善必是从仁爱所流出的良善，因此，信本身在内义上无非是仁，如前所示（<a href="2231.htm">2231</a>节）。至于人们说，对真理的承认就是施行拯救的信，要知道，过着违背仁爱生活的人绝不可能有任何承认，只有某种粘附着自我之爱或尘世之爱生命的某种说服与这承认联结，以致他们所谈论的承认并没有信的生命，也就是仁的生命。最坏的人出于自我之爱或尘世之爱，也就是说，为了在所谓的聪明智慧，因而赚取荣耀、名利方面胜过别人，也能学习信之真理，并以很多方式确认它们；但他们所具有的那些真理仍是死的。<br />真理的生命，因而信的生命唯独来自主，主是生命本身。主的生命是怜悯，怜悯是对全人类的爱之生命。那些信奉信之真理，但与自己相比看不起别人的人，绝不可能吸收主的生命。当其自我之爱和尘世之爱的生命被触动时，他们就会对邻人心怀仇恨，并以邻人丧失财富、荣耀、名声和生命为乐。但信之真理的情况是：人凭它们重生，因为它们才是真正接受良善的容器。因此，真理如何，真理中的良善就如何，这些真理与良善的结合，以及它们由此结合而在来世被完善的能力就如何。这就是死后幸福快乐的状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2261</b></p><p><b>2261.</b>
If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the midst of the city. That this signifies if truths are full of goods, is evident from the signification of "fifty," as being what is full, and from the signification 
of "the midst of the city," as being within truth, or in truth (as explained above, n. 2252, where the same words occur). It may be supposed that a man cannot but be saved if truths are full of 
goods. But be it known that there are very few truths with man, and that if there are any, they have no life unless there are goods in them; and that if there are goods in them, he is saved, but from 
Mercy. For, as before said, the truths with man are very few; and the goods which are in them have their quality in accordance with the truths, and the man's life. [2] Regarded in themselves, truths 
do not give life. It is goods that give life. Truths are only recipients of life, that is, of good. And therefore no one can ever say that he can be saved by truths (or as the common expression is, by 
faith alone), unless there is good in the truths which are of faith, and this good that must be in the truths must be the good of charity; hence faith itself, in the internal sense, is nothing else 
than charity (as shown above, n. 2231). As regards people's saying that the acknowledgment of truth is the faith that saves, be it known that with those who live in things contrary to charity, there cannot 
possibly be any acknowledgment but only persuasion, to which there has been adjoined the life of the love of self or of the world; thus in the acknowledgment they refer to there is not the life 
of faith, which is that of charity. The worst men of all-from the love of self or the world, that is, for the sake of being eminent above others in what is called intelligence and wisdom, and thus of 
winning honors, reputation, and gains-can learn the truths of faith, and confirm them by many things; but still with them these truths are dead. [3] The life of truth, and thus of faith, is solely from 
the Lord, who is life itself. The Lord's life is mercy, which is that of love toward the universal human race. In the Lord's life those can in no wise have part who although they profess the truths 
of faith despise others in comparison with themselves, and who, when their life of the love of self and of the world is touched, hold the neighbor in hatred, and take delight in his loss of wealth, of 
honor, of reputation, and of life. But the case with the truths of faith is that by means of them man is regenerated, for they are the veriest vessels recipient of good. Such therefore as are the truths, 
and such as are the goods in the truths, and such as is their conjunction and the consequent capability of being perfected in the other life, such is the state of blessedness and happiness after death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2261</b></p><p><b>2261.</b>
'If I find in Sodom fifty righteous persons in the midst of the city' means if truths are full of goods. This is clear from the meaning of 'fifty' as that which is full, and from the meaning of 'the 
midst of the city' as that which is present inwardly, or within truth, dealt with above in <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>, which see since the same words occur there. It may be assumed that a person is certain to be saved if truths 
are full of goods. But it should be recognized that very few truths exist with man; and if they do, that they have no life unless there are goods within them; and if they have goods within them, 
that he is saved, but on account of mercy. For as has been stated, very few truths reside with a person, and the goods contained within them receive their character from the truths and from that person's 
life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Regarded in themselves truths do not confer life; but goods do so. Truths are simply the recipients of life, that is, of good. Nobody is ever able to say therefore that he can be saved 
by means of truths or as is commonly asserted, by faith alone- not, that is, unless within the truths, which are part of the faith, good is present. And this good which must exist within them must 
be the good that flows from charity. This explains why in the internal sense faith itself is nothing else than charity, as shown above in <a href="2231.htm">2231</a>. When people say that the acknowledgement of truth is the 
faith that saves, it should be recognized that no acknowledgement can possibly exist with people who lead lives immersed in things contrary to charity, only some kind of persuasion which has the life 
of self-love or of the love of the world allied to it, so that the acknowledgement which they speak of does not have within it the life of the faith which is that of charity. The worst people of all, 
acting from self-love or from love of the world, that is, acting for the sake of excelling others in what are called intelligence and wisdom, and so acting for the sake of earning exalted positions, 
reputation, and gain, have the ability to grasp the truths of faith and to confirm them in many ways; but with them those truths are nevertheless dead. The life of truth and so of faith comes solely from 
the Lord, who is Life itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Lord's life is mercy, which is that of love towards the whole human race. Those people cannot possibly be drawing on the life that is the Lord's who, although 
they profess the truths of faith, despise others in comparison with themselves, and who, where their self-love and love of the world are affected, harbour hatred towards the neighbour and are delighted 
when he experiences loss of wealth, position, reputation, and life. But the position with the truths of faith is that it is by means of them that one is regenerated, for they are the actual vessels 
for receiving good. As are the truths therefore, also the goods within those truths, and the combination of those truths and goods and from this their capacity to be perfected in the next life, so 
is the state of blessedness and happiness of that person after death. </p>

`Si invenero in Sodoma quinquaginta justos in medio urbis': quod significet si vera sint plena bonis, constat a significatione `quinquaginta' quod sit plenum, et a significatione `medii urbis' quod 
sit intus in vero, seu in vero, de qua supra n. 2252, quae videantur nam sunt eadem verba. Autumari potest quod homo non possit non salvari, si vera sint plena bonis; sed sciendum quod apud hominem paucissima 
vera sint, et si quae sunt, quod nullam vitam habeant nisi in illis sint bona, et si in illis bona, quod salvetur, sed ex misericordia; nam ut dictum, paucissima vera sunt apud hominem, et tam 
quae in illis, secundum vera et vitam hominis suam qualitatem habent, Vera in se spectata non dant vitam, sed bona; [2] sunt vera modo recipientia vitae, hoc est, boni; quare nusquam aliquis dicere 
potest quod per vera, seu ut communis sermo est, per fidem solam salvari possit, nisi in veris quae sunt fidei, sit bonum; bonum quod inerit, erit bonum charitatis {1}, inde ipsa fides in sensu interno 
non aliud est quam charitas, ut supra n. 2231 ostensum; quod dicant quod agnitio veri sit fides quae salvat, sciendum quod apud eos qui in contrariis charitati vivunt, nusquam dari queat {2} agnitio, 
sed aliqua persuasio cui adjuncta est vita amoris sui aut mundi, ita in agnitione illa non est vita fidei quae est charitatis; omnium pessimi ex amore sui aut mundi, seu ex causa prae aliis eminendi 
intelligentia et sapientia, ut vocatur, et sic aucupandi honores, famam, lucra, possunt arripere vera fidei et illa multis confirmare, sed usque apud eos vera illa sunt mortua: vita veri, ita fidei, 
unice est a Domino, Qui `est' Ipsa Vita; [3] Vita Domini est misericordia, quae est amoris erga universum genus humanum; ex Vita Domini nusquam (t)possunt habere illi qui tametsi vera fidei profitentur 
{3} alios contemnunt prae se, et cum vita amoris sui et mundi eorum tangitur, odio habent proximum, et jucundum percipiunt in ejus opum, honoris, famae, et vitae, jactura: sed ita se habet cum veris 
fidei quod per illa regeneretur homo, nam sunt ipsissima vasa recipientia boni; qualia itaque sunt vera, et qualia sunt bona in {4} veris, et qualis conjunctio et inde facultas, ut illa perficiantur 
in altera vita, talis (o)est status beatitudinis et felicitatis post {5} mortem. 	@1 i inde vita fidei.$ 	@2 possit.$ 	@3 i usque.$ 	@4 i quae.$ 	@5 i hominis est.$ </p>
