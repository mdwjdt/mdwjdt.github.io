<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2439节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2439.</strong>“因此，他称那城名为琐珥”表对真理的情感。这从“琐珥”和“称名”的含义清楚可知：“琐珥”是指对良善的情感，也就是说，对知识之善的情感，知识之善就是对真理的情感（参看<a href="1589.htm">1589</a>节）；“称名”是指了解某人或某物的本质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>节）。这里的意思是有少许真理，因为“琐珥”这个名字原义表“少许”或“小”。与那些拥有对良善的情感之人相比，那些拥有对真理的情感之人有少许真理，因为他们拥有少许良善（参看<a href="2429.htm">2429</a>节）。<br />此外，本身为真理的真理对于这个人更真实，对于另一个人则不那么真实，对于有些人则根本不是真理，甚至是虚假。这从本身为真理的几乎一切清楚看出来，因为在具有真理的个体里面，真理根据该个体的情感而有所不同。例如，做善行或行仁之善本身是一个要付诸实践的真理。对这个人来说，这就是仁之善，因为它是从仁爱发出的；对另一个人来说，这是顺服的行为，因为它是从顺服发出的；而对有些人来说，这是寻求功德的行为，因为他们渴望凭着它赚取功劳，获得救恩；对另一些人来说，这是虚伪的行为，因为他们做这种事是为了能让外人看到他们似乎很仁慈，诸如此类。所有被称为信之真理的其它事也一样。这表明，那些拥有对良善的情感之人具有大量真理，而那些拥有对真理的情感之人则具有少量真理；因为后者认为良善距离自己更为遥远，而前者则认为良善就在自己里面。</p>

Therefore he called the name of the city Zoar. That this signifies the affection of truth, is evident from the signification of Zoar," as being the affection of good, namely, of the good of knowledge, 
that is, the affection of truth (see n. 1589); and from the signification of "calling a name," as being to know the quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 2009); here that there was a little truth, for in 
the original language "Zoar" means "little," or "small." In comparison with those who are in the affection of good, they who are in the affection of truth have little truth because they have little good 
(see above, n. 2429). [2] Moreover that truths which are in themselves truths are with one person more true, with another less true, and with some not true at all, and even false, is evident from 
almost all things which in themselves are true; for they are varied in the man with whom they are, in accordance with his affections. For example, the doing of a good work or a good of charity: in itself 
it is a truth that this is to be done; and with one person it is a good of charity, because it proceeds from charity; with another it is a work of obedience, because it proceeds from obedience; with 
some it is work of self-merit, because by it they desire to merit and to obtain salvation; but with others it is hypocritical, being done in order that they may seem charitable; and so on. It is the 
same with all other things that are called truths of faith. And this shows that there is much truth with those who are in the affection of good, and less truth with those who are in the affection of 
truth; for the latter regard good as being more remote from themselves, whereas the former regard good as being present in themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2439</b></p><p><b>2439.</b>
'Therefore he called the name of the city Zoar' means the affection for truth. This is clear from the meaning of that city as the affection for good, that is to say, the affection for good that is the 
fruit of knowledge, which is the affection for truth, dealt with in <a href="1589.htm">1589</a>, and from the meaning of 'calling the name' as knowing the essential nature of some person or thing, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>. Here the meaning is that little truth was present, for the name 'Zoar' in the original language means little or small. People with the affection for truth possess little truth because they 
possess little good in comparison with those with the affection for good; see above <a href="2429.htm">2429</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is more, truths which are in themselves truths are more true with one person, less so with another; 
and with some they are not truths at all but indeed falsities. This becomes clear from almost all things which in themselves are truths. For truths as they reside-with the individual vary according 
to his affections. For example, the doing of a good work or the good of charity is in itself a truth to be put into practice. With one person it is the good of charity because it flows from charity, with 
another a work of obedience because it flows from obedience, with others it is a merit-seeking because they wish by means of it to earn merit and salvation, but with certain people it is a hypocritical 
action which they do to be seen by others; and so on. So it is with all other truths which are called truths of faith. From this it also becomes clear that much truth resides with people with the 
affection for good, but less truth with those with the affection for truth; for the latter look on good as something rather remote from themselves while the former look on it as something present within 
themselves. </p>

</p><b>2439.</b>
`Propterea vocavit nomen urbis Zoar': quod significet affectionem veri, constat a significatione ejus quod sit affectio boni nempe scientiae, hoc est, affectio veri, de qua n. 1589; et a significatione 
`vocare nomen' quod sit nosse qualis est, de qua n. 144, 145, 1754, 2009, hic nempe quod sit parum veri, nam per `Zoar' in lingua originali significatur parum, seu parvum; qui enim in affectione veri 
sunt, parum veri quia parum boni habent respective ad illos qui in affectione boni sunt, videatur supra n. 2429.  [2] Quod et vera quae in se vera sunt, apud unum magis vera sint, apud alium minus 
vera, apud quosdam prorsus non vera, immo falsa, constare potest paene ab omnibus quae in se vera sunt, nam illa apud hominem, apud quem sunt, variantur secundum ejus affectiones; ut pro exemplo, facere 
bonum opus seu bonum charitatis, hoc in se verum est quod faciendum; id apud unum est bonum {1} charitatis quia procedit a charitate, apud alium est opus oboedientiae quia procedit ab oboedientia, 
apud aliquos est meritorium quia per illud mereri volunt et salvari, apud quosdam autem est hypocriticum ut sic videantur, et sic porro; ita in omnibus reliquis quae vera fidei vocantur; inde quoque 
constare potest quod multum veri sit apud eos qui in affectione boni sunt, et minus veri apud eos qui in affectione veri, nam hi spectant bonum ut remotius a se, illi autem bonum ut praesens in se. 	@1 opus.$ </p>
