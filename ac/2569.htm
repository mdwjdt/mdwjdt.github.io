<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2569节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2569.</strong>“给亚伯拉罕”表将这些给予主。这从亚伯拉罕代表主清楚可知，对此，前面已多次说明。“又把他妻子撒拉归还他”表当神性属灵之物与神性属天之物联结时。这从“妻子撒拉”的含义清楚可知，“妻子撒拉”是指与属天良善联结的属灵真理（参看<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）。本节这些话的内义从前面所述明显可知，即当主里面的人性与神性，并神性与人性融合后，祂不仅拥有对神性属天和属灵之物的全知，还拥有对属天之下和属灵之下的事物（infra-celestial and infra-spiritual things）的全知，也就是对理性和属世之物的全知。因为从神性，如同从一切光的源头那样能看到当下所存在的万事万物。</p>

And gave unto Abraham; and restored to him Sarah his wife. That he "gave unto Abraham" signifies to the Lord, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord (concerning which frequently 
before). That he "restored unto him Sarah his wife" signifies when the Divine spiritual had been adjoined to the Divine celestial, is evident from the signification of "Sarah a wife," as being spiritual 
truth adjoined to celestial good (see n. 2507). The internal sense of the words in this verse is manifest from what has been said, namely, that when the Human in the Lord had been united to the 
Divine, and the Divine to the Human, He then possessed omniscience not only of Divine celestial and spiritual things, but also of infra-celestial and infra-spiritual things, that is, of rational and 
natural things; for from the Divine, as from the Sun of all light, everything is seen as present. </p>

'And gave to Abraham' means, imparted these to the Lord...... This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord, dealt with many times already, while '....and he restored to him Sarah his 
wife' means.... when the Divine spiritual had been joined to the Divine celestial is clear from the meaning of 'Sarah his wife' as spiritual truth joined to celestial good, dealt with in <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>. The internal 
sense of the words in this verse is evident from what has been stated, namely that when the Human within Him had been united to the Divine, and the Divine to the Human, the Lord had complete knowledge 
not only of Divine celestial and spiritual things, but also of infra-celestial and infra-spiritual, that is, of rational and natural things. For from the Divine, as from the Source of all light, 
all things are seen as existing in the present moment. </p>

Quod `dedit Abrahamo' significet quod Domino, constat a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, de qua multoties prius: `et restituit illi Sarah uxorem ejus' quod significet quando Divinum spirituale 
adjunctum esset Divino caelesti, constat a significatione `Sarae uxoris' quod sit verum spirituale adjunctum bono caelesti, de qua n. 2507; quis sensus internus verborum in hoc versu sit, ex dictis 
patet, nempe quod Domino, cum unitum in Ipso Humanum Divino (c)et Divinum Humano, fuerit omniscientia non modo Divinorum caelestium et spiritualium, sed etiam infracaelestium et infraspiritualium, 
hoc est, rationalium et naturalium; nam ex Divino, ut ex sole omnis lucis, singula ut praesentia videntur. </p>
