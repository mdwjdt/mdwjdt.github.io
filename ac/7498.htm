<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7498节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7498.</strong>“你要到法老那里去，对他说”表从神来的真理在那些进行侵扰之人中间的显现。这从“到某人那里去”和“说”的含义，以及“法老”和摩西的代表清楚可知：“到某人那里去”是指出现或显现，如下文所述；“说”是指交流；“法老”是指那些在来世侵扰属灵教会成员的人（参看<a href="7107.htm">7107</a>，<a href="7110.htm">7110</a>，<a href="7126.htm">7126</a>，<a href="7142.htm">7142</a>，<a href="7220.htm">7220</a>，<a href="7228.htm">7228</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>节）；要到法老那里去并对他说的摩西是指从神来的真理（参看<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>，<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>，<a href="7382.htm">7382</a>节）。“到”或“进到”之所以表示出现或显现，是因为就灵义而言，这些词语就表示属于心智，因而属于思维的事物，当“到或进到某人那里去”论及思维时，它表示使这人出现在人的思维中，因为思想别人的人就使得这人出现在他的思维中。说来奇妙，在来世，当一个人因想与别人交谈而思想他时，这个人就会与他同在，出现在眼前。由此明显可知，在来世，当灵人像世人那样进行思考时，他们所思考的东西就会活生生地呈现出来，变得可见。由此可见，“到或进到某人那里去”表示出现或显现。</p>

Come unto Pharaoh, and speak unto him. That this signifies the appearance of truth from the Divine with those who infest, is evident from the signification of "coming" or "entering in" unto anyone as 
being presence or appearance (of which below); and from the signification of "speaking," as being communication; from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who infest in the other life those 
who are of the spiritual church (see n. 7107, 7110, 7126, 7142, 7220, 7228, 7317); and from the representation of Moses, who was to enter in unto Pharaoh and speak unto him, as being truth from the Divine 
(see n. 6771, 6827, 7014, 7382). That "to come" or "enter in" denotes presence or appearance, is because in the spiritual sense these phrases signify things that belong to the mind, consequently 
to the thought; and when "coming" or "entering in" unto anyone is said of the thought, it denotes to present him to one's view, for he who thinks about anyone makes him present to himself; and wonderful 
to say, in the other life he of whom anyone thinks with longing to speak with him, is also presented to view. From this it is evident that in the other life when spirits think as a man thinks in the 
world, that which they think of is presented to the life. From this then it can be known that by "coming" or "entering in" unto anyone is signified presence or appearance. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7498</b></p><p><b>7498.</b>
'Go to Pharaoh, and you are to tell him' means the appearance of the truth from God among those engaged in molestation. This is clear from the meaning of 'going (in) to someone' as becoming present or 
appearing, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'telling' as communication; from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those who in the next life molest members of the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="7107.htm">7107</a>, <a href="7110.htm">7110</a>, <a href="7126.htm">7126</a>, <a href="7142.htm">7142</a>, <a href="7220.htm">7220</a>, <a href="7228.htm">7228</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>; and from the representation of Moses, who was to go in to Pharaoh and speak to him, as the truth from God, dealt with in <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>, <a href="7014.htm">7014</a>, <a href="7382.htm">7382</a>. The reason why 
'going (in) to' means the presence or appearance is that in the spiritual sense things connected with the mind and therefore with thought are meant, and when 'going (in) to someone is used in reference 
to thought, it means making that person present in one's thought; for one who thinks about another causes that other to be present in his thought. And what is astonishing, in the next life when one 
person is thinking about another because he wishes to talk to him, that other becomes present with him. From this it is evident that in these matters there is a similarity between what goes on in the 
thinking of a person in the world and what takes place visibly in the next life. From all this one may now see that 'going (in) to someone' means the presence or appearance. </p>

`Veni ad Pharaonem, et loquaris ad illum': quod significet apparentiam veri a Divino apud illos qui infestant, constat a significatione `venire' seu `intrare ad aliquem' quod sit praesentia {1}seu apparentia, 
de qua sequitur; ex significatione `loqui' quod sit communicatio; ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint qui infestant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, in altera vita, de qua n. 7107, 7110, 
7126, 7142, 7220, 7228, 7317; et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' qui intraret ad Pharaonem, et loqueretur ad illum', quod sit verum a Divino, de qua n. 6771, 6827, 7014, 7382.  Quod `venire' {2}et 
`intrare' sit praesentia {3}seu apparentia, est quia {4} in spirituali sensu {5}significant illa quae mentis sunt, proinde quae cogitationis, et cum de cogitatione {6}praedicatur `venire' seu `intrare 
ad aliquem,' est illum praesentem sibi sistere, nam qui de aliquo cogitat, is illum sibi ponit praesentem; et, quod mirum, {7} in altera vita ille de quo aliquis ex desiderio loquendi cum illo cogitat, 
etiam sistitur praesens; inde patet quod in his similiter {8}sicut homo in mundo cogitat, in altera vita sistatur ad vivum; inde nunc {9}sciri potest quod per `venire' seu `intrare ad aliquem' significetur 
praesentia seu apparentia. 	@1 et hic$ 	@2 seu$ 	@3 et$ 	@4 i venire et intrare$ 	@5 significat$ 	@6 dicitur quod veniat seu intret ad alium, est quod praesens sit, nam qui de aliquo cogitat,
