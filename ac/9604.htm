<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9604节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9604.</strong>“这五幅幔子要彼此相连，那五幅幔子也要彼此相连”表真理与良善并良善与真理的不断交流。这从“五”和“幔子”的含义清楚可知：“五”是指这一边的一切，因为“十”表示整体的一切（参看<a href="9595.htm">9595</a>节）；“幔子”是指信之内层真理，这些真理属于新的理解力，也如前所述（<a href="9595.htm">9595</a>节）。因此，由于十幅幔子中的五幅连在一起，那五幅也是连在一起，所以它们表示真理与良善并良善与真理的一种相互交流；因为它们之间的交流必定是相互的，以便真理与良善能结合在一起并结婚。这些幔子与属于人里面左右两边的事物表示相同的事物：属于右边的事物与真理所源于的良善有关，而属于左边的事物则与源于良善的真理有关。良善与真理并真理与良善的交流则在它们中间，以便它们永远不断地结合在一起。这些就是“这五幅幔子要彼此相连，那五幅幔子也要彼此相连”这句话所表示的事物。</p>

Five curtains shall be joined together one to the other; and five curtains shall be joined together one to the other. That this signifies the constant communication of truth with good, and of good with 
truth, is evident from the signification of "five," as being all things of one side, for by "ten" are signified all things of the whole (see n. 9595); and from the signification of the "curtains," 
as being the interior truths of faith, which are of the new understanding (see also n. 9595). Hence, as five of the ten curtains were joined together, and also the other five, they therefore signified 
the reciprocal communication of truth and good, and of good and truth; for the communications must be reciprocal in order that there may be a conjugial conjunction of truth and good. The like things 
are signified by these curtains as by the things that belong to the left side and the right side in man. Those which belong to his right side relate to the good from which is truth, but those of the left 
side relate to the truth which is from good; and in the middle of these there is the communication of good with truth, and of truth with good, from which there results a perpetual and constant conjunction. 
Such are the things signified by the words, "five curtains shall be joined together one to the other, and five curtains shall be joined together one to the other." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9604</b></p><p><b>9604.</b>
'Five curtains shall be joined together, each one to the next, and five curtains joined together, each one to the next' means unceasing communication of truth with good and of good with truth. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'five' as all on one side, for 'ten' means all of the whole, <a href="9595.htm">9595</a>; and from the meaning of 'curtains' as interior truths of faith which belong to the new understanding, also 
dealt with above in <a href="9595.htm">9595</a>. Hence because the ten curtains were joined together five and five, a reciprocal communication of truth and good and of good and truth is meant by them, for the communication 
between them must be reciprocal, in order that the truth and good may be joined together and be married. They are similar in meaning to things on the left side and those on the right in a human being 
- to those on the right side in that they have connection with the good from which truth springs, but to those on the left side in that they have connection with the truth that springs from the good. 
And in the middle between them the communication of good with truth and of truth with good takes place, so that they are perpetually and unceasingly joined together. Such are the realities meant by 
the words, Five curtains joined together, each one to the next, and five curtains joined together, each one to the next.  </p>

`Quinque aulaea erunt conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum, et quinque aulaea conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum': quod significet communicationem veri cum bono et boni cum vero constantem, constat ex significatione 
`quinque' quod sint omnia unius partis, nam pes decem significantur omnia {1}totius, n. 9595, et ex significatione `aulaeorum' quod sint vera interiora fidei quae intellectualis novi, de qua etiam 
supra n. 9595; hinc quia ex decem aulaeis quinque et quinque erant conjuncta, ideo significatur per illa communicatio veri et boni, ac boni et veri, reciproca, nam communicationes erunt reciprocae, 
ut conjunctio conjugialis {2}veri et boni sit. Similia {3}per haec significantur quae per (c)ea quae sunt partis sinistrae et quae sunt partis dextrae in homine; illa quae sunt partis dextrae in eo, 
se referunt ad bonum ex quo verum, {4}illa autem quae sunt partis sinistrae, se referunt ad verum quod ex bono; et in medio eorum est communicatio boni cum vero et veri cum bono, unde conjunctio {5}perpetua 
et constans; talia sunt quae significantur per ea verba, `quinque aulaea conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum, et quinque aulaea conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum.' @1 quoad totum$ @2 boni et veri$ @3 
After significantur$ @4 et illa$ @5 ita se habet cum omnibus apud hominem, et ita cum repraesentativis, quae quod se referant ad formam humanam, et secundum relationem ad illam significent, videatur 
n. 9496, ita quoque Habitaculum quoad aulaea, quinque conjuncta quodvis ad alterum.$ </p>
