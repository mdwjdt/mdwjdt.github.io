<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2037节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2037.</strong>“这就是你们当守的，在我与你之间所立的约”表所有人与主结合的标志。这从“约”的含义清楚可知，“约”是指结合，如前面所解释的。此处所表示的是结合的标志，这从下一节明显可知，那里提到“立约的记号”：“你们都要受割礼，这是我与你们之间立约的记号”。教会的一切外在仪式都是立约的记号，并要被尊为圣，因为它们表示内在事物。此处所提及的割礼无非是具有代表性和属灵之义的宗教仪式，如下文所解释的。尽管如此，在圣言中，这类宗教仪式经常被称为“立约”，因为外在事物代表并由此表示内在事物。使得“约”成为“约”的，是内在事物。因为它们具有结合的果效，外在事物则没有这种果效，除非通过内在事物。外在事物只是立约的记号或结合的标志。他们凭这记号或标志忆起内在事物，并由此被结合（关于立约的记号，参看<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>节）。属于约或具有结合果效的所有内在事物都关系到爱与仁，并源于爱与仁。一切律法与先知，也就是信的整个教义就取决于这两样事物，即爱神胜过爱己，且爱邻如己（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.34.htm">22:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.39.htm">39</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.28.htm">12:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.35.htm">35</a>）。</p>

This is My covenant, which ye shall keep between Me and you. That this signifies a token of the conjunction of all with the Lord, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction, 
as explained before. That it is here the token of conjunction, is evident from the next verse, where it is called "a sign of a covenant:" "Ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall 
be for a sign of a covenant between Me and you." All the external rites of the church were signs of the covenant, and were to be sacredly observed, because internal things were signified by them. 
Circumcision-which is treated of here-was nothing but a representative and significative rite, and as such is explained in what follows; nevertheless in various passages of the Word such rites are called 
the "covenant," for the reason that external things represented and thereby signified internal things. The internal things are what belong to the covenant, because they are effective of conjunction, 
and the external things are not so except by means of the internal ones. The external things were merely signs of the covenant, or tokens of the conjunction, by means of which they might call to mind 
the internal things and thereby be conjoined by means of these. (Respecting the signs of the covenant, see above, n. 1308.) All the internal things that belong to the covenant, or that are effective 
of conjunction, relate to love and charity, and proceed from love and charity; for on these two things, namely, loving God more than one's self, and loving the neighbor as one's self, "hang all the 
law and the prophets," that is, the universal doctrine of faith (Matt. 22:34-39; Mark 12:28-35). </p>

That 'this is My covenant which you shall keep between Me and you' means a token of the conjunction of all with the Lord is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as conjunction, dealt with already. 
That a token of conjunction is meant here is clear from the next verse where it is called 'a sign of the covenant' in the statement, 'You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it will be a 
sign of the covenant between Me and you'. All the external religious ceremonies of the Church were signs of the covenant, ceremonies which were to be held sacred since they were signs meaning things of 
an internal nature. The circumcision referred to here was nothing else than a religious ceremony that was representative and carried a spiritual meaning, as will be explained in the paragraphs following 
this. All the same, such religious ceremonies in the Word are frequently called a covenant for the reason that external things represented and thereby meant internal things. The internal things are 
what make it a covenant because it is these that are conjunctive, not external things except through internal. External things were simply the signs of the covenant, or tokens of conjunction, by which 
the internal things might be called to mind and so by which conjunction might take place. Concerning signs of the covenant, see <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>. All the internal aspects of the covenant, that is, those which 
bring about conjunction, have reference to love and charity and stem from love and charity, for on these two, that is to say, on loving the Lord more than oneself and the neighbour as oneself, depend 
all the Law and all the Prophets, that is, the doctrine of faith in its entirety, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:35-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:35-40</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:28-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:28-35</a>. </p>

</p><b>2037.</b>
`Hoc foedus Meum quod custodietis inter Me et inter vos': quod significet indicium conjunctionis omnium cum Domino, constat ex significatione `foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua prius; hic quod sit 
indicium conjunctionis, constat a versu sequente ubi appellatur `signum foederis' ubi haec, `circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri, et erit in signum foederis, inter Me et inter vos.' `Signa foederis' 
erant omnes ritus externi Ecclesiae, qui sancte habendi, quia per illos significabantur interna; circumcisio de qua hic agitur, nec fuit nisi ritus repraesentativus et significativus, de quo in sequentibus; 
sed usque tales ritus in Verbo passim vocantur `foedus,' ex causa quia externa repraesentabant et sic significabant interna; interna sunt foederis quia conjungunt, non autem externa nisi per 
interna; externa erant solum signa foederis seu indicia conjunctionis, ex quibus recordarentur internorum et sic per haec conjungerentur; de signis foederis videatur n. (x)1038; omnia interna quae foederis 
sunt seu quae conjungunt, se referant ad amorem et charitatem, et ex amore et charitate procedunt, nam ex his binis, nempe amare Dominum {1} supra se et proximum ut se, omnis Lex et omnes Prophetae, 
hoc est, universa doctrina fidei pendet, Matth. xxii 34-39; Marc. xii 28-35. 	@1 Deum.$ </p>
