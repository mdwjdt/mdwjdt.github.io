Verses 5-8. And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the crimson, and the scarlet double-dyed, and the fine linen. And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue and crimson, of scarlet double-dyed 
and fine twined linen, with the work of a thinker.* It shall have two shoulders joined at the two extremities thereof; and it shall be joined together. And the girdle of his ephod, which is upon 
it, according to the work thereof shall be from it; of gold, of blue and crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed and fine twined linen. "And they shall take the gold," signifies good reigning universally; 
"and the blue, and the crimson, and the scarlet double-dyed, and the fine linen," signifies the good of charity and of faith; "and they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue and crimson, of scarlet 
double-dyed and fine twined linen," signifies the external of the spiritual kingdom from this good; "with the work of a thinker,"* signifies from the understanding; "it shall have two shoulders joined 
at the two extremities thereof, and it shall be joined together," signifies the preservation by a complete unition of good and truth on all sides and forever, with all exertion and power; "and the girdle 
of his ephod, which is upon it," signifies an external binding-together; "according to the work thereof, shall be from it," signifies what is like and continuous from the external of the spiritual 
kingdom; "of gold, of blue and crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed and fine twined linen," signifies thus from the good of faith and of charity, in external things. * skilled craftsman </p>

Verses 5-8 And they shall take the gold, and the violet, and the purple, and the twice-dyed scarlet, and the fine linen, and they shall make the ephod from gold, violet, and purple, twice-dyed scarlet, 
and fine twined linen, with the work of a designer. Two shoulders<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> joined together shall it have at its two ends, and it shall be joined together. And the girdle of his ephod, which is on it, shall

'And the violet, and the purple, and the twice-dyed scarlet, and the fine linen' means the good of charity and faith. 'And they shall make the ephod from gold, violet, and purple, twice-dyed 
scarlet, and fine twined linen' means the outermost part of the spiritual kingdom springing from that good. 'With the work of a designer' means a product of the understanding. 'Two shoulders joined together 
shall it have at its two ends, and it shall be joined together' means an everlasting preservation of good and truth on every side by all exertion and power through a total uniting together. 'And 
the girdle of his ephod, which is on it' means the outward bond that gathers things together. 'Shall be of the same workmanship, of [one piece with] it' means that which is like the outermost part 
of the spiritual kingdom and is a continuation from it. 'From gold, violet, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twined linen' means thus from the good that belongs to faith and to charity on 
outermost levels.
