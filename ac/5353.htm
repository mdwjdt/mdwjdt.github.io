<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5353.</strong>“和我父的全家”表遗传之恶的移除。这从“父的家”的含义清楚可知，“父的家”在此是指遗传之恶。“家”在内义上表示一个人，事实上表示他的心智，要么是他的理性心智，要么是他的属世心智，尤表那里的意愿，因而表示良善或邪恶，因为这些作为意愿的属性而存在（参看<a href="710.htm">710</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>，<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>，<a href="5023.htm">5023</a>节）；故“父的爱”在此表示遗传之恶。“玛拿西”所表示的性质就包含在这些和此前的话里。在原文，“玛拿西”表示“遗忘”，因而在内义上表示邪恶的移除，无论人实际所行的邪恶还是遗传的邪恶；因为一旦这些邪恶被移除，一个新意愿就会产生。这个新意愿通过来自主的良善的流注产生。来自主的这种良善的流注在人身上是持续不断的；但却有邪恶存在于那里，无论他自己所行的邪恶，还是遗传的邪恶，阻碍并挡住了对它的接受。不过，一旦这些邪恶被移除，一个新意愿就会产生。这时，它的产生在那些遭受不幸、磨难或疾病的人当中是显而易见的。在这些经历期间，为一切邪恶源头的自我之爱和尘世之爱被除去；于是人便好好思想神和邻舍，还渴望他的邻舍好。试探也一样，试探是属灵的痛苦，因而是内在的悲伤和绝望。这些经历主要是为了除去邪恶，待它们被除去后，天上的良善就会从主流入，一个新意愿从这良善而在属世层里面得以形成；这个新意愿就是代表意义上的“玛拿西”。</p>

And all my father's house. That this signifies the removal of hereditary evils, is evident from the signification of "father's house," as here being hereditary evils; for by a "house" in the internal 
sense is signified a man, and indeed his mind either rational or natural, but specifically the will therein, consequently good or evil, because these are predicated of the will (see n. 710, 2233, 2234, 
3128, 4973, 4982, 5023); and therefore by "father's house" here are signified hereditary evils. The quality signified by "Manasseh" is contained in these and the immediately preceding words. In the 
original language "Manasseh" means "forgetfulness," thus in the internal sense the removal of evils, both actual and hereditary; for when these are removed, a new will arises, for the new will comes 
into existence through the influx of good from the Lord. The influx of good from the Lord with man is continuous; but there are evils both actual and hereditary that hinder and obstruct the reception 
of it; and therefore when these are removed, a new will comes into existence. This is very evident in the case of those who are in misfortune, misery, and illness; for as in these the loves of self and 
of the world, from which come all evils, are removed, the man thinks well about God and the neighbor, and also wishes his neighbor well. It is similar in temptations, which are spiritual pains, and 
hence inward miseries and despairings: by these chiefly are evils removed, and after they have been removed, heavenly good flows in from the Lord, whereby a new will is formed in the natural, and this 
new will is "Manasseh" in the representative sense. </p>

'And all my father's house' means the removal of hereditary evils. This is clear from the meaning of 'father's house' here as hereditary evils. In the internal sense 'house' means a person, more particularly 
his mind, either his rational mind or his natural mind. But specifically the will part there is meant, consequently good or evil since either of these can exist as an attribute of the will, see <a href="710.htm">710</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, <a href="5023.htm">5023</a>. This being so, 'father's house' here means hereditary evils. The essential nature meant by 'Manasseh' is contained in these words and in those immediately before 
them. In the original language Manasseh means forgetfulness, and so in the internal sense a removal is meant. That is to say, a removal of evils, both those of one's own doing and those which are 
hereditary; for once those evils have been removed a new area of will arises. This new will comes into being through an inflow of good from the Lord. Such an inflow of good from the Lord takes place 
constantly with a person, but evils exist there - both those of his own doing and those which he has inherited - which hinder and stand in the way of the reception of it. But once these have been removed 
a new area of will comes into being. Its coming into being at this time is clearly evident with those who suffer misfortunes, tribulations, or illnesses. During these experiences self-love and love 
of the world from which all evils spring are removed, and then a person entertains thoughts about God and about the neighbour that are good, and also desires his neighbour's welfare. It is similar 
with temptations, which are spiritual forms of distress and therefore inward experiences of tribulation and of despair. These experiences serve primarily to remove evils, and after these have been removed 
heavenly good from the Lord enters in, from which a new area of will is formed in the natural, which in the representative sense is 'Manasseh'. </p>

`Et omnis domus patris mei': quod significet remotionem malorum hereditariorum, constat ex significatione `domus patris' quod hic sint mala hereditaria; per `domum' enim in sensu interno significatur 
homo, et quidem ejus mens aut rationalis aut naturalis, in specie autem voluntarium ibi, consequenter bonum aut malum quia haec praedicantur de voluntate, videatur n. 710, 2233, 2234, 3128, 4973, 4982, 
5023, et quia ita, per `domum patris' hic significantur mala hereditaria. Quale quod per Menashen significatur, in his et mox praecedentibus verbis continetur; Menasheh {1} in lingua originali significat 
oblivionem, ita in sensu interno remotionem, nempe malorum tam actualium quam hereditariorum, his enim remotis novum voluntarium assurgit; novum enim voluntarium existit per influxum boni a Domino; 
influxus boni a Domino est continuus apud hominem, sed sunt mala tam actualia quam hereditaria quae inhibent et obstant ne recipiatur, quapropter illis remotis voluntarium novum existit; quod tunc 
existat, manifeste patet apud illos qui in infortuniis, miseriis ac in morbis sunt; in his, quia removentur amores sui et mundi a quibus sunt omnia mala, homo cogitat bene de Deo et de proximo, et 
quoque huic bene vult; similiter in tentationibus, quae sunt dolores spirituales, ac inde miseriae interiores, (c)ac desperationes; per has praecipue removentur mala, quae postquam remota sunt, influit 
bonum caeleste a Domino, inde novum voluntarium in naturali, quod est Menasheh in sensu repraesentativo. @1 i enim$ </p>
