The Internal Sense.      Verses 1-5. And these are the names of the sons of Israel that came into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his house they came. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun, 
and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. And all the souls that came out of the thigh of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt. "And these are the names of the sons of Israel," signifies 
the quality of the church; "that came into Egypt with Jacob," signifies after truths had been initiated into memory-knowledges; "a man and his house they came," signifies as to truth and as to good; 
"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher," signify this process from beginning to end; "and all the souls that came out of the thigh of Jacob," 
signifies all things that were from general truth; "were seventy souls," signifies what is full; "and Joseph was in Egypt," signifies that the internal celestial was in the natural. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-5 And these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob - a man and his household they came: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun, 
and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. And every soul, those who came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt. </p>
<p>'These are the names of the sons of Israel' means the 
essential nature of the Church. 'Who came to Egypt with Jacob' means after truths have been introduced into factual knowledge.' A man and his household they came' means in regard to truth and in regard 
to good. 'Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher' means the whole process from start to finish. 'And every soul, those who came out of Jacob's 
thigh' means everything that springs from general truth. 'Were seventy souls' means that which was complete. 'And Joseph was in Egypt' means that the internal celestial was within the natural. </p>
