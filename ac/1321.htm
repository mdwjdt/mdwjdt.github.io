<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1321.</strong>“在那里变乱他们的口音”表没人拥有教义的真理。这从“口音”的含义清楚可知，在第1节已说明，“口音（即嘴唇）”表教义。所以，“变乱口音”就是变乱构成教义的事物，也就是教义的真理。在内义上，“变乱”不仅表变暗，还表抹杀和驱散，以致真理荡然无存。当自我崇拜取代对主的敬拜时，一切真理不仅被滥用，甚至被废除，直到最后取代真理的虚假和取代良善的邪恶得到承认。因为真理的一切光明来自主，一切黑暗来自人；当人取代主成为敬拜的对象时，真理的光明就变成黑暗；然后人视光为暗，视暗为光。<br />这种人死后的生命也是如此。在他们眼里，虚假的生命看似光明，而真理的生命则看似黑暗。但当他们接近天堂时，这种生命之光就转变成彻底的黑暗。诚然，他们在世时能谈论真理，甚至口若悬河，并且因总是考虑自己，故觉得真理仿佛也在他们头脑里。但由于他们的根本目的是自我崇拜，故这目的制约了他们的思维，致使他们不承认真理，除非自我在这真理中。将真理挂在嘴皮子上的人就具有这样的特征，显然，他没有拥有真理。在来世，这是显而易见的，因为在那里，像这样的人不仅不承认他们在世时所公开宣称的真理，还仇恨并迫害它，激烈程度取决于他们的傲慢或自我崇拜未被踢除的程度。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1321.</strong> The meaning of let us muddle their language as the fact that no one knows any doctrinal truth can be seen from the symbolism of a language, [a lip, or speech] as doctrine (discussed above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1321/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1" target=_top>1</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1321/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286" target=_top>1286</a>]). This leads to the conclusion that muddling the language is bringing confusion to the things doctrine teaches — that is, to doctrinal truth.<br />At an inner level, muddling something symbolizes not only darkening it but also obliterating it and scattering it to the winds, so that there is no longer anything true about it.<br />When self-worship replaces worship of the Lord, all truth is perverted. Not only is it perverted, it is also abolished, and in the end falsity is acknowledged as truth, and evil as goodness. All the light of truth comes from the Lord, and every bit of darkness from humankind. When human beings take over the Lord's role in worship, the light of truth becomes darkness. Then people see light as darkness and darkness as light.<br />[2] The same holds true for their existence after death: a life of falsity is like light to them, but a life of truth is like darkness. The light in this false way of life turns into pure darkness, though, when they go near heaven.<br />During the time they live in the world, admittedly, they can speak the truth. In fact they can do so with eloquence and seeming zeal. And since they never stop mirroring everything back onto themselves, they also see themselves as believing what they say. But their real aim is worship of themselves, and the effect this aim has on their thinking is to keep them from acknowledging the truth, except so far as they can find a self-serving angle to it. When people who carry truth on their tongue are like this, the truth clearly is not true for them. This fact is obvious in the other world, where such people not only fail to acknowledge the truth they proclaimed during bodily life but even hate and attack it. The less they lose of their arrogance and self-adulation, the more they lash out at truth. </p>

And there confound their lip. That this signifies that not anyone has the truth of doctrine, may be seen from the signification of "lip," as being doctrine, concerning which see above (at verse 1). Hence 
it follows that to "confound the lips" is to confound the things that are of doctrine, that is, the truths of doctrine. In the internal sense, "to confound" signifies not only to darken, but also 
to blot out and dissipate, so that there is not any truth. When the worship of self succeeds in the place of the worship of the Lord, then all truth is not only perverted, but is even abolished, and 
at last falsity is acknowledged in the place of truth, and evil in the place of good. For all the light of truth is from the Lord, and all darkness is from man; and when man takes the place of the Lord 
in worship, the light of truth becomes thick darkness; and then the light is seen by men as thick darkness, and thick darkness is seen as the light.  [2] Such moreover is precisely the life of such 
persons after death; the life of falsity is to them as if it were light, but the life of truth is to them as thick darkness. But when they approach toward heaven, the light of such a life is changed 
into total darkness. So long as they are in the world, they can indeed speak truth, even with eloquence and apparent zeal; and as there is with all such persons a constant reflection upon self, they seem 
to themselves to think as they speak; but as their very end is the worship of self, their thoughts derive from the end that they do not acknowledge truth except insofar as self is in the truth. When 
a man in whose mouth is the truth is of such a character, it is evident that he does not possess the truth; and in the other life this is plainly evident, for there such men not only do not acknowledge 
the truth which they had professed in the life of the body, but hold it in hatred, and persecute it; and this just in proportion as their arrogance or their worship of self is not taken away. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1321</b></p><p><b>1321.</b>
That 'let us confound their lip' means that nobody has the truth of doctrine becomes clear from the meaning of 'lip' as doctrine, dealt with above at verse 1. Consequently 'confounding lips' is confounding 
the things that comprise doctrine, that is, the truths of doctrine. In the internal sense 'confounding' means not only darkening but also erasing and scattering so that no truth is left. When worship 
of self supplants worship of the Lord all truth is not only perverted but also done away with, till at length falsity is acknowledged in place of truth and evil in place of good. In fact all the 
light of truth comes from the Lord, and all thick darkness from man. When man takes the Lord's place in worship the light of truth turns to thick darkness, and in this case people see the light as thick 
darkness, and thick darkness as the light. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such also is the life of those people after death. To them the life of falsity looks like light, while the life of truth looks to them like thick 
darkness. But when they go near heaven the light of such life turns to total darkness. While they are in the world they are indeed able to utter the truth, and to do so eloquently and with seeming zeal. 
And because they are all the time thinking of themselves it seems to them as though truth is also in their minds. But because their end in view is worship of themselves, this end conditions their 
thoughts so that they do not acknowledge truth except insofar as self is present in that truth Anyone like this, though truth is on his lips, clearly has no truth within him. This is quite evident in 
the next life, for there such people not only fail to acknowledge the truth which they have professed during their lifetime, but also hate it and persecute it. This they do to the extent that pride or 
worship of self is not taken away from them. </p>

</p><b>1321.</b>
Quod 'confundamus labium eorum' significet quod nulli verum doctrinae sit, constare potest a significatione 'labii' quod sit doctrina, de qua supra ad vers. 1; inde sequitur quod 'confundere labia' 
sit confundere illa quae sunt doctrinae, hoc est, vera doctrinae:  'confundere' significat in sensu interno non solum obtenebrare sed etiam obliterare et dissipare, sic ut non aliquid verum. Cum cultus 
sui succedit loco cultus Domini, tunc non solum pervertitur omne verum sed etiam aboletur, et tandem agnoscitur falsum pro vero et malum pro bono; omnis enim lux veritatis est a Domino, et omnis caligo 
est ab homine; cum homo succedit in cultu loco Domini, fit lux veri caligo; et tunc spectatur ab iis lux ut caligo, et caligo ut lux; [2] talis quoque est vita eorum post mortem; vita falsi iis est 
quasi lux, sed vita veri est iis quasi caligo; sed mutatur talis vitae lux in meram caliginem cum approximant versus caelum:  dum in mundo sunt, quidem verum possunt loqui, immo cum eloquio et apparente 
zelo, et quia adest continua reflexio super se, etiam videntur sibi idem cogitare; sed quia ipse finis est cultus sui, cogitationes a fine trahunt quod non agnoscant verum nisi quantum sui in vero 
sit; cum homo talis est, in cujus ore verum, constat quod ei non verum sit; quod manifeste patet in altera vita, ibi tales non solum non agnoscunt verum quod professi in vita corporis, sed etiam odio 
habent et persequuntur, et in tantum, in quantum iis fastus aut sui cultus non adimitur. </p>
