<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9042节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9042.</strong>“击伤有孕的妇人”表伤害由真理所形成的良善。这从“击伤”和“有孕的妇人”的含义清楚可知：“击伤”是指伤害；“有孕的妇人”是指良善正从真理形成。“有孕的妇人”之所以表示这一点，是因为一个人从父母所接受的属世生命的出生在内义上就表示他的重生，也就是他里面属灵生命的出生。当一个人重新出生时，他首先成孕，然后可以说被带入子宫，最后出生。由于重生，或属灵生命的出生就是真理与良善，也就是信与仁的结合，所以“带入子宫”表示将真理发展为良善。由此可见“有孕的妇人”表示什么，即良善正从真理形成的状态。“子宫”（经上或译为母腹、母胎等）表示真理和良善得以孕育的地方（参看<a href="4918.htm">4918</a>，<a href="6433.htm">6433</a>节）；“在子宫（或母腹，母胎）里”、“出子宫（或出母腹、母胎）”表示重生（<a href="4904.htm">4904</a>，<a href="8043.htm">8043</a>节）；“产生”和“出生”是指信和仁的产生和出生（<a href="613.htm">613</a>，<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="2020.htm">2020</a>，<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>，<a href="6239.htm">6239</a>节）。<br />耶利米书中的“孕妇”也表示良善正从真理形成的状态：<br />看哪，我必将他们从北方之地领来，从地极招聚他们，他们当中有瞎子、瘸子、孕妇、产妇，都在一起。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.8.htm">31:8</a>）<br />这在内义上论及主所建立的一个新教会。就内义而言，“将他们从北方之地领来”是指把他们从信的模糊中带出来（参看<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）；“将要招聚他们所来的地极”是指教会的真理和良善开始的地方，“地”是指教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>，<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>，<a href="8732.htm">8732</a>节），地“极”是指它的初和末所在的地方；“瞎子”是指那些对真理一无所知，但当被教导时就接受真理的人（<a href="2383.htm">2383</a>，<a href="6990.htm">6990</a>节）；“瘸子”是指那些处于良善，但因对真理的无知而未处于纯正良善的人（<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>节）；“孕妇”是指那些良善在其中正通过真理得以形成的人；“产妇”是指那些在行动上过着一种信仰生活的人（<a href="3905.htm">3905</a>，<a href="3915.htm">3915</a>，<a href="3919.htm">3919</a>节）。此处所表示的是这类事物，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：若非如此，经上提及“瞎子、瘸子、孕妇、产妇，都在一起”将是多余的，并且毫无意义。</p>

And shall strike a pregnant woman. That this signifies the injuring of the good which is from truth, is evident from the signification of "to strike," as being to injure; and from the signification of 
"a pregnant woman," as being the formation of good from truth. That this is signified by "a pregnant woman," is because the regeneration of man, which is the generation of the spiritual life in him, 
is meant in the internal sense of the Word by the generation of his natural life which is from his parents. For when a man is born anew, he is then first conceived, afterward carried as in the womb, 
and finally is born. And because regeneration, or the generation of spiritual life, is the conjunction of truth and of good, that is, of faith and of charity, therefore by "carrying in the womb" is signified 
the initiation of truth into good. From this it is plain what is signified by "a pregnant woman," namely, the state of the formation of good from truths. (That "the womb" denotes where truth and 
good lie conceived, see n. 4918, 6433; and that "to be in the womb," and "to come forth from the womb" denote to be regenerated, n. 4904, 8043; also that "generations" and "births" denote those of 
faith and charity, n. 613, 1145, 1255, 2020, 2584, 6239.) [2] The state of the formation of good from truths is also signified by "a pregnant woman" in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold I bring them from the land 
of the north, and I will gather them from the sides of the earth; among them the blind and the lame, she that is pregnant, and she that bringeth forth together (Jer. 31:8). In the internal sense this 
treats of a new church from the Lord, in which sense by "bringing them from the land of the north" is signified from an obscure state of faith (see n. 3708); by "the sides of the earth from which 
they shall be gathered" is signified where the truth and good of the church begin, for "the earth" denotes the church (n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447, 
4535, 5577, 8011, 8732), and its "sides" denote where its first and its last are; by "the blind" are signified those who are in ignorance of truth, and yet receive truth when instructed (n. 2383, 
6990); by "the lame," those who are in good, but not genuine good because of their ignorance of truth (n. 4302); by "she that is pregnant," those in whom good is being formed by means of truths; and by 
"she that bringeth forth," those who are in the life of faith in act (n. 3905, 3915, 3919). That such things are here signified can be seen from the fact that otherwise it would have been superfluous 
and worthless to make mention of "the blind and lame," or of "she that is pregnant, and she that bringeth forth together." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9042</b></p><p><b>9042.</b>
'And inflict a blow on a pregnant woman' means injuring the good that is being formed out of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'inflicting a blow' as injuring; and from the meaning of 'a pregnant 
woman' as forming good out of truth. The reason why this is meant by 'a pregnant woman' is that a person's regeneration, which is the generation of spiritual life with him, is meant in the internal 
sense by the generation of his natural life received from his parents. When a person is born anew he is first conceived, then carried in the womb so to speak, and finally born. And since regeneration 
or the generation of spiritual life consists in the joining together of truth and good, that is, of faith and charity, 'carrying in the womb' means developing truth into good. From this one may see 
what 'a pregnant woman' means, namely a state in which good is being formed out of truths. </p>
<p>The womb means the place in which truth and good have been conceived and are lying, see <a href="4918.htm">4918</a>, <a href="6433.htm">6433</a>. </p>
<p>'Being 
in the womb, and 'going out of the womb' mean being regenerated, <a href="4904.htm">4904</a>, <a href="8043.htm">8043</a>. </p>
<p>'Generations and 'births' are those of faith and charity, <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="2020.htm">2020</a>, <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>, <a href="6239.htm">6239</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A state in which 
good is being formed out of truths is again meant by 'a pregnant woman', in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Behold, I am bringing them from the north land, and I will gather them from the furthest parts of the earth, among 
them the blind one and the lame, the pregnant one and her who is giving birth, together. Jer. <a href="31.htm">31</a> :8. </p>
<p>This refers in the internal sense to a new Church established by the Lord. In that sense 'bringing 
them from the north land' means bringing them away from obscurity of faith, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>; 'the furthest parts of the earth' from which they will be gathered are the places where the Church's truth and 
good begin, 'the earth' being the Church, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>, <a href="8011.htm">8011</a>, <a href="8732.htm">8732</a>, and 'the furthest parts of it' being the places 
where its first and outermost boundaries are 'The blind one' means those who have no knowledge of truth but accept the truth when taught it, <a href="2383.htm">2383</a>, <a href="6990.htm">6990</a>; 'the lame' means those who are governed by good, 
but not by genuine good because they have no knowledge of truth, <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>; 'the pregnant one' means those with whom good is being given form by means of truths; and 'her who is giving birth' means those 
leading a life of faith realized in action, <a href="3905.htm">3905</a>, <a href="3915.htm">3915</a>, <a href="3919.htm">3919</a>. It may be recognized that things of this nature are meant there from the further consideration that otherwise it would have been superfluous 
and pointless to mention 'the blind one and the lame, the pregnant one and her who is giving birth, together'. </p>

`Et plaga affecerint mulierem gravidam': quod significet laesionem boni quod ex vero, constat ex significatione `plaga afficere' quod sit laesio, et ex significatione `mulieris gravidae' quod sit formatio 
boni ex vero; quod id per `mulierem gravidam' significetur, est quia regeneratio hominis, quae est generatio vitae spiritualis apud illum, in sensu interno Verbi intelligitur per generationem vitae 
ejus naturalis quae a parentibus; nam cum homo e novo nascitur, tunc primum concipitur, dein gestatur quasi in utero, et demum nascitur; et quia regeneratio seu generatio vitae spiritualis est conjunctio 
veri et boni, hoc est, fidei et charitatis, idcirco per `gestare utero significatur initiatio veri in bonum; inde patet (x)quid significatur per `mulierem gravidam,' quod nempe status formationis 
boni ex veris; quod uterus sit ubi verum et bonum jacet conceptum, videatur n. 4918, 6433, quod esse in utero et exire ex utero sit regenerari, n. 4904, 8043, et quod generationes ac nativitates 
sint fidei et charitatis, n. 613, 1145, 1255, 2020, 2584, 6239. Status formationis boni ex veris per `gravidam' etiam significatur 2 apud Jeremiam, Ecce Ego adducens eos e terra septentrionis, et congregabo
