Verse 13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold a ram behind, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead 
of his son. "Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw," signifies the Lord's thought and mental view from the Divine; "and behold a ram," signifies the spiritual from the human race; "behind, caught in a thicket," 
signifies entangled in natural knowledge; "by his horns," signifies with all power as to the truths of faith. "And Abraham went, and took the ram," signifies their liberation by the Lord's Divine 
Human; "and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son," signifies their sanctification and adoption. </p>

Verse 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, a ram behind [him] caught in a thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his 
son. </p>
<p>'Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw' means the Lord's thought and insight received from the Divine. 'And behold, a ram' means spiritual members of the human race. 'Behind [him] caught in a thicket' 
means entangled in natural knowledge. 'By its horns' means with all its power as regards truths of faith. 'And Abraham went and took the ram' means their release effected by the Lord's Divine Human. 
'And offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son' means their sanctification and adoption. </p>

Vers. 13.  Et sustulit Abraham oculos suos, et vidit, et ecce aries post detentus in perplexo cornibus suis; et ivit Abraham, et accepit arietem, et obtulit illum in holocaustum loco filii sui. `Sustulit 
Abraham oculos suos, et vidit' significat Domini cogitationem et intuitionem ex Divino: `et ecce aries' significat spirituales ex humano genere: `post detentus in perplexo' significat {1}implicatos 
scientifico naturali: `cornibus suis' significat omni potentia quoad vera fidei: `et ivit Abraham et accepit arietem' significat liberationem eorum ex Divino Humano Domini: `et obtulit illum in holocaustum 
loco filii sui' significat sanctificationem eorum et adoptationem. @1 implicatus I, but see n. 2831$ </p>
