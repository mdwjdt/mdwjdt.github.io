<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2871节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2871.</strong>地狱灵不知道除了满足对自我和这个世界的爱，也就是满足控制、迫害和仇恨凡不服侍他们的所有人，折磨每个人，若能够，为达到自己的目的不惜摧毁整个宇宙，夺走他人的东西并据为己有的欲望之外，还有其它自由的存在。当满足这些及类似欲望时，他们就是在享受自由，因为他们正在获取自己的快乐。其生命就在于这样的自由，甚至到了若拿走它，除了留有新生婴儿的生命外，他们不再有丝毫生命的地步。这一事实还通过活生生的经历向我显明。有一个恶灵确信这类事物能从他身上被除掉，然后他便能以这种方式进入天堂；因此，他的生命能奇迹般地变成天堂的生命；鉴于此，他的爱及其欲望便从他身上被拿走了（这种事在来世通过分裂做到），然后，他看似用几乎不能动的双手划水的婴儿；同时，他还处于这样的状态：其思维能力甚至还不如婴儿，他完全不会说话，什么也不知道。不过，很快他就恢复自己的快乐，从而恢复自己的自由。由此明显可知，凡通过对自我和这个世界的爱为自己获得生命，因而处于这些爱欲的自由之人不可能进入天堂。若将那生命从这种人身上拿走，他就不会有丝毫思维和意愿存留。</p>

Infernal spirits do not know that there is any other freedom than that which is of the love of self and the love of the world; that is, of the cupidities of commanding, of persecuting and hating all 
who do not serve them, of tormenting everyone, of destroying the universe if they could for the sake of self; of taking away and claiming to themselves whatever is another's. When they are in these and 
similar things, they are in their freedom, because they are in their delight. Their life consists in this freedom to such a degree that if it were taken away from them, nothing more of life would remain 
to them than that of a newborn infant. This was also shown by living experience. A certain evil spirit was in the persuasion that such things could be taken away from him, and that in this way he 
could come into heaven; consequently that his life could be miraculously changed into heavenly life; on which account those loves together with their cupidities were taken away from him (which is done 
in the other life by dissociation), and he then appeared like an infant paddling with his hands, which he could scarcely move; and he was at the same time in such a state as to be less able to think 
than any infant, and unable to speak anything at all, or to know anything. But he was soon restored to his delight, and thus to his freedom. From this it is manifest that it is impossible for anyone 
to come into heaven who has procured a life for himself from the love of self and the world, and consequently who is in the freedom of these loves; for if that life were taken away from such a person, 
he would not have anything of thought and will remaining. </p>

Spirits in hell do not know of the existence of any other freedom than that which goes with self-love and love of the world, that is, with the desires to exercise control over others, to persecute, and 
to hate all who do not serve them, to torment everyone, to destroy for their own ends if they could the whole world, and to carry away and claim for themselves whatever belongs to another. While gratifying 
these and similar desires they are enjoying what to them is freedom, for they are attaining what is their delight. Their life consists in that freedom to such an extent that if it is taken away 
from them no more life is left to them than that of a new-born child. This has also been shown to me through an actual experience. A certain evil spirit was convinced that such things could be taken 
away from him, and that if they were he could enter heaven, and that consequently his life could be miraculously transformed into heavenly life. His loves and the desires belonging to these were therefore 
taken away from him - which is done in the next life by dissociation.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> He now looked like a small child floating around, scarcely able to move its hands. He was at the same time in such a state 
that he was able to think even less than any infant, being totally unable to speak anything at all or to know anything. But shortly he was restored to his own delight and thus freedom. From this it was 
evident that it is impossible for anyone to enter heaven who has acquired life for himself from self-love and love of the world, and whose freedom consequently rests in these. For if that life were 
taken away from such a person he would not have any thought or will at all remaining in him.

</p><b>2871.</b>
Infernales spiritus non sciunt quod aliud liberum sit quam quo est amoris sui et amoris mundi, hoc est, cupiditatum imperandi, persequendi et odio habendi omnes qui non serviunt, cruciandi quoscumque, 
destruendi sui causa, si possent, universum, auferendi et sibi vindicandi quicquid est alterius; cum in his et similibus sunt, in suo libero, quia in suo jucundo, sunt; in illo libero consistit vita 
eorum usque adeo ut si illud iis auferatur, non plus vitae iis supersit quam quantum infanti recens nato:  ostensum quoque hoc per vivam experientiam; spiritus quidam malus in persuasione erat quod 
tali potuissent ei auferri, et sic venire in caelum, proinde quod potuisset vita ejus miraculose transcribi in vitam caelestem, quare ei amores illi cum eorum cupiditatibus auferebantur, quod fit in altera 
vita per dissociationem, et visi tunc manifeste sicut infans natans manibus quas vix posset movere, et erat simul in statu ut minus quam aliquis infans posset cogitare, nihil prorsus loqui, nec 
quicquam scire; sed mox restitutus est suo jucundo et sic libero:  inde patuit quod impossibile sit, qui ex amore sui et mundi, et consequenter in illorum libero, vitam sibi comparavit, possit in caelum 
venire; si enim tali auferretur illa vita, non aliquid cogitationis et voluntatis residuum haberet. </p>
