<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3700节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3700.</strong>“梯子的头顶着天”表与神性，也就是说，与祂的联系。这从“头”或梯顶和“天”的含义清楚可知：“头”或梯顶是指最高点；“天”是指神性。因为就论述主的至高意义而言，“天”表示神性本身；而就论述正经历重生之人的代表意义而言，“天”表来自主的至内在的良善及其衍生真理，就是诸如存在于天堂并由此形成天堂本身的那一类。天堂还被称为“神性”，因为它源于主。事实上，主，或也可说，唯独来自主的神性，是天堂全部中的全部。任何事物若不是源于那里的神性，就不是天堂的一部分。这就为何前面经常说，主是天堂本身，凡在天堂的，都居于主里面。</p>

And its head reaching to heaven. That this signifies with the Divine, namely, that there was communication therewith, is evident from the signification of the "head," or summit of the ladder, as being 
that which is highest; and from the signification of "heaven," as being that which is Divine; for in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of, "heaven" signifies the Divine Itself; but in 
the representative sense, which treats of the man who is being regenerated, it signifies the inmost good and its derivative truth that is from the Lord, such as there is in heaven, and from which is heaven 
itself. This is also called "Divine," because from the Lord; for the Lord, or what is the same, the Divine, which is from the Lord alone, is the all in all of heaven; and whatever is not from the 
Divine there, is not of heaven. For this reason it has been occasionally said above that the Lord is heaven itself, and that all who are in heaven are in the Lord. </p>

'And its top reaching to heaven' means with the Divine, that is to say, communication with Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'the top of the stairway', or the uppermost part of it, as the highest 
point, and from the meaning of 'heaven' as the Divine. For in the highest sense, where the Lord is the subject, heaven is the Divine Himself; but in the representative sense, where the person who is 
being regenerated is the subject, it is inmost good and attendant truth from the Lord such as exist in heaven and from which heaven itself is formed. Heaven too is called Divine because it has its origin 
in the Lord. For heaven is the Lord, or what amounts to the same, the Divine coming from the Lord alone, who is the All in all of heaven. Anything which does not derive from the Divine there is not 
part of heaven. This is why it has been frequently stated already that the Lord is heaven itself, and that those who are in heaven abide in the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3700</b>
</p><b>3700.</b>
`Et caput ejus pertingens caelum': quod significet cum Divino, nempe quod communicatio, constat a significatione `capitis scalae' seu summitatis ejus quod sit supremum; et a significatione `caeli' quod 
sit Divinum; caelum enim in supremo sensu in quo agitur de Domino, est ipsum Divinum, at in sensu repraesentativo in quo agitur de homine qui regeneratur, est intimum bonum et inde verum quod a Domino, 
quale est in caelo, et ex quali est ipsum caelum; hoc quoque Divinum dicitur quia a Domino; est enim Dominus, seu quod idem, Divinum quod a Solo Domino, Omne in omnibus caeli; quod non a Divino 
ibi, hoc non est caeli; inde est quod aliquoties prius dictum quod Dominus sit ipsum caelum, et quod in Domino sint qui in caelo. </p>
