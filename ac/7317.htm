<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7317节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7317.</strong>“水就变作血”表它们会歪曲真理。这从“血”的含义清楚可知。“血”是指被歪曲的真理（参看<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>节）；因为“血”在正面意义上表示从主发出的真理，因而表示信的神圣；这就是圣餐中的“血”所表示的；但在反面意义上表示向神性真理所施的暴行，由于这种暴行是通过歪曲得逞的，所以“血”是指对真理的歪曲。从此处和接下来所说的可以看出“法老”具体代表谁，也就是说，那些进行侵扰的人具体是指谁，即是指教会中那些宣称自己站在信仰这一边，相信信仰拯救人，然而却过着违背信仰诫命的生活之人；简言之，他们是那些持守虚假信仰，过着邪恶生活的人。<br />当这些人进入来世时，他们便带来这样的假设：他们要被引入天堂，因为他们在教会出生并受洗，拥有圣言，以及他们所宣称相信的取自圣言的教义，尤其因为他们宣称信主，祂为他们的罪而受难，由此拯救教会中那些出于教义宣称信祂的人。当这些人刚从世界来到来世时，他们不想知道有关信与仁之生活的任何事，反认为它无足轻重，声称因他们有信，所以损毁其生命的一切罪恶都被羔羊的血洗净、冲走了。但这时，他们被告知，这些观念违背主在马太福音的话，在那里，主说：<br />当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名说预言，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我必向他们声明，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！所以，凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人。凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个愚拙的人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />在路加福音：<br />那时，他们开始站在外面叩门，说，主啊，主啊，给我们开门！祂要回答你们说，我不认识你们，不知道你们是哪里来的。那时，你们要开始说，我们在你面前吃过、喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。可祂要说，我告诉你们，我不知道你们是哪里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.25.htm">13:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.27.htm">27</a>）<br />但当他们被告知这一切时，却回答说，这些人不是指其他人，仅仅是那些拥有神迹所引发的信仰之人，而不是指那些拥有教会信仰的人。<br />然而，过了一段时间后，这些人开始认识到，除了那些活了信仰的生活，因而拥有对邻之仁的人外，没有人被允许进入天堂。当开始认识到这一点时，他们开始鄙视其信仰的教义，也鄙视其信仰本身；因为他们的信并不是信，只是诸如构成信的那类事物的知识；它的存在不是为了生活，仅仅是为了获得利益和重要地位。因此，他们开始鄙视构成其信之知识的事物，从而抛弃它们；不久之后，他们沉浸在违背信之真理的虚假之中。这就是那些宣称站在信仰这一边，却过着违背信仰的生活之人所生活于其中的状态。他们就是在来世通过虚假侵扰正直人的人，因而是“法老”具体所指的人。</p>

And they shall be turned into blood. That this signifies that they shall falsify truths, is evident from the signification of "blood," as being truth falsified (see n. 4735, 6978); for "blood" in the 
genuine sense denotes the truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the holy of faith; this is signified by "blood" in the Holy Supper; but in the opposite sense "blood" denotes violence done to Divine truth, 
and as this violence is done by means of falsifications, "blood" denotes the falsification of truth. From what is here said, and from what follows, it can be seen who are specifically represented 
by Pharaoh, that is, who are specifically meant by those who infest, namely, those within the church who have made a profession of faith, and have also persuaded themselves that faith saves, and yet 
have lived contrary to the precepts of faith; in a word, those who have been in persuasive faith and in a life of evil.  [2] When these come into the other life they bring with them the principles that 
they are to be introduced into heaven because they have been born within the church, have been baptized, have had the Word and doctrine therefrom which they have professed, and especially because they 
have professed the Lord, and because He suffered for their sins, and thus saved those within the church who have from doctrine professed Him. When these persons come fresh from the world into the 
other life they do not desire to know anything about the life of faith and of charity, but make it of no account, saying that because they have had faith, all evils of life have been wiped off and washed 
away by the blood of the Lamb. When they are told that these things are contrary to the Lord's words in Matthew, where He says, "Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
through Thy name, and through Thy name have cast out devils, and in Thy name have done many mighty deeds? But then will I confess, I know you not; depart from Me ye workers of iniquity; everyone that 
heareth My words and doeth them, I will liken to a prudent man, and everyone that heareth My words, and doeth them not, I will liken unto a foolish man" (Matt. 7:22-26); and in Luke, "Then shall ye begin 
to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He answering shall say to them, I know you not whence ye are; then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in 
Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets; but He shall say, I say unto you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me all ye workers of iniquity" (Luke 13:25-27), they reply that by these 
are meant no others than such as have been in miraculous faith, but not in the faith of the church. [3] Yet the same after some time begin to know that no others are let into heaven than they who have 
lived the life of faith, thus who have had charity toward the neighbor; and when they begin to know this, then they begin to despise the teachings of their faith, and also their faith itself; for 
their faith was not faith, but only the knowledge of such things as are of faith; and was not for the sake of life, but for the sake of gain and honors. Consequently what they have had of the knowledge 
of faith they then despise, and also reject; and presently they cast themselves into falsities that are contrary to the truths of faith. Into this state the life of those is turned who have confessed 
faith, and have lived a life contrary to faith. These are they who in the other life infest the upright by means of falsities, thus who are specifically meant by "Pharaoh." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7317</b></p><p><b>7317.</b>
'And they will be turned into blood' means that they will falsify truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'blood' as falsified truth, dealt with in <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, 'blood' in the genuine sense is truth 
emanating from the Lord, thus the holiness of faith, this being what is meant by blood in the Holy Supper. But in the contrary sense 'blood' is violence done to Divine Truth, and since it is done by 
means of falsifications, 'blood' is the falsification of truth. From this and from what follows it may be seen who specifically are represented by 'Pharaoh', or who specifically are meant by those who 
molest - those within the Church who have declared themselves on the side of faith and have also convinced themselves that faith saves, yet have led a life contrary to the commandments intrinsic to faith. 
In short they are those whose faith has been false and whose life has been evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When these people enter the next life they bring with them the assumption that they are to be introduced into 
heaven because they were born and baptized within the Church, possessed the Word, and also the teachings drawn from the Word which they had claimed to believe in, and especially because they claimed 
to believe in the Lord, who suffered for their sins and thereby saved those within the Church who from a knowledge of its teachings claimed to believe in Him. When these people first arrive in the 
next life from the world they do not wish to know anything about a life of faith and charity. They regard it as of no account, saying that because they have possessed faith all the evils marring their 
life have been purged and washed away by the blood of the Lamb. But then they are told that these ideas are contrary to the Lord's words in Matthew, where He says this,  </p>
<blockquote>
Many will say to Me on that 
day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy through Your name, and through Your name cast out demons, and do many mighty works in Your name? But then I will confess to them, I do not know you; depart from 
Me, you workers of iniquity. Everyone who hears My words and does them I liken to a wise man; but everyone hearing My words and not doing them I liken to a foolish man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:11-24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:11-24, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Then 
you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He replying will say to you,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I do not know where you come from. Then you will begin to say, We 
ate in Your presence and we drank; and You taught in our streets. But He will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from; depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:25-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:25-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But when 
they are told this they reply that only those who possessed faith induced by miracles are meant, not those who possessed the faith of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But after some time these same people start 
to learn that none are admitted into heaven apart from those who have led the life of faith, that is, have had charity towards the neighbour. And when they start to learn this they begin to feel contempt 
for the teachings making up their faith, and their faith itself also. For their faith had not been faith but merely a knowledge of such things as constitute faith; and it had not existed for life's 
sake, only for the sake of making gain and having important positions. So it is that they begin to feel contempt for the things which had composed their knowledge of faith, and so cast them aside, 
soon after which they immerse themselves in falsities opposed to the truths of faith. This is the state in which those who have declared themselves on the side of faith, yet have led a life contrary to 
faith, come to live. These are the ones who in the next life molest the upright by means of falsities, thus who are meant specifically by 'Pharaoh'.

`Et vertentur in sanguinem': quod significet quod falsificabunt vera, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' quod sit verum falsificatum, de qua n. 4735, (x)6978; `sanguis' enim in genuino sensu est {1} 
verum procedens a Domino, ita sanctum fidei; hoc significatur per sanguinem in Sacra Cena; at in opposito sensu est `sanguis' violentia illata Divino Vero, quae quia fit per falsificationes, est `sanguis' 
falsificatio veri.  Ex his et ex sequentibus constare potest quinam in specie repraesentantur per `Pharaonem,' (x) seu {2}quinam in specie intelliguntur per illos qui infestant {3}, quod nempe 
sint illi intra Ecclesiam' qui professi sunt fidem, et quoque sibi persuaserunt quod fides {4}salvet, et tamen vixerunt contra praecepta fidei; verbo, qui in fide persuasiva 2 fuerunt, ac in vita mali; 
illi cum in alteram vitam veniunt, secum ferunt principia, quod in caelum introducendi, quia nati intra Ecclesiam, baptizati, Verbum {5}habuerunt, et doctrinam inde, quam professi {6}, imprimis quia 
Dominum, {2}et quod Is pro peccatis illorum passus sit, ac ita illos qui intra Ecclesiam Ipsum ex doctrina professi sint salvaverit; hi cum in alteram vitam e mundo recens veniunt, non scire aliquid 
volunt de fidei et charitatis vita; hanc nihili faciunt; dicunt, quia fidem habuerunt, omnia vitae mala abstersa et abluta esse per sanguinem Agni; cum illis dicitur quod haec contra Domini verba sint 
apud Matthaeum, ubi haec, Multi dicent Mihi in die illa, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen Tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen Tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in nomine Tuo virtutes multas fecimus? sed tunc 
confitebor {7}, Non novi vos, discedite a Me operarii iniquitatis; omnis qui audit Mea verba et facit illa, comparo viro prudenti; at omnis audiens verba Mea, sed non faciens illa, comparo viro stulto, 
vii 21-23, 24, 26: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam, Tunc incipietis foris stare, et pulsare januam, dicendo, Domine, Domine, aperi nobis; sed respondens dicet illis, Non novi vos unde sitis; tunc incipietis dicere, 
Edimus coram Te, et bibimus, et in plateis nostris docuisti; sed dicet, Dico vobis, non novi vos unde sitis; discedite a Me, omnes operarii iniquitatis xiii 25-27; </p>
<p>sed ad haec respondent quod per illos 
non intelligantur alii quam qui in fide miraculosa fuerunt, non autem in fide Ecclesiae. 	3 Ast iidem post aliquod tempus scire incipiunt quod non alii in caelum intromittantur quam qui vitam fidei 
vixerunt, ita qui charitatem erga proximum habuerunt; et cum hoc incipiunt scire, tunc doctrinalia fidei suae incipiunt vilipendere, et quoque ipsam fidem; nam fides illorum non fuit fides sed modo 
scientia talium quae fidei, et non fuit propter vitam sed propter lucrum et honores; inde est quod illa quae scientiae fidei illis fuerant tunc vilipendant et quoque rejiciant; et mox se injiciunt in 
falsa contra vera fidei; in hunc statum vertitur vita illorum qui confessi fidem, et vixerunt vitam fidei contrariam.  Hi sunt qui in altera vita per falsa infestant probos, {8}ita qui per `Pharaonem'
