<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3048节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3048.</strong>“那仆人从他主人的骆驼里取了十匹骆驼就离开了”表属世人里面一般的神圣记忆知识。这从此处“仆人”，以及“十”和“骆驼”的含义清楚可知。“仆人”是指属世人（参看<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>，<a href="3020.htm">3020</a>节）。“十”是指余留，这些余留就是主储存在人里面的良善与真理（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节）；当论及主时，“十”或余留是指主为自己所获得的神圣之物（<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>节）。“骆驼”是指一般的记忆知识，由于这些知识是神性，或主所获得的事物，故经上说它们有“十匹”，然后说它们是“从他主人的骆驼里所取的骆驼”。“离开了”表示藉着这些知识所实现的引入，这也是本章所论述的。<br />此处论述的主题是真理与良善在主的神圣理性里面结合的过程。首先是引入的过程（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>-<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>节），其性质也有一系列的描述。本节则描述了主如何在属世人里面将来自祂自己的事物，也就是神圣之物，与来自母亲的事物分开。来自祂自己的事物，或神圣之物就是藉以实现引入的事物，它们在此由“从他主人的骆驼里所取的十匹骆驼”来表示。这解释了为何接下来的经文反复提及“骆驼”，如他便叫骆驼跪在城外 （24:11）；利百加也给骆驼喝（24:14，19-20）；它们被牵进家，喂了粮草和饲料（24:31-32）；还有，利百加和她的少女们骑上骆驼（24:61）；以撒看见骆驼来了，利百加看见以撒就下了骆驼（24:63-64）。骆驼由于内义而多次被提及，就内义而言，它们表示属世人里面的一般记忆知识，那要被引入理性里面的良善情感的真理情感便由此而来。这种引入是以正常方式实现的，如前所示，因为若没有记忆知识和认知，真理方面的理性绝无可能生出并得以完善。<br />“骆驼”表一般记忆知识，这从圣言中提及它们的其它经文明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />论南方牲畜的默示：在艰难困苦之地；少壮狮子、老狮子、蝮蛇、火焰的飞龙就从那里来；它们把财物驮在驴驹的脊背上，将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上，往那不利于它们的民那里去；因为埃及的帮助是徒然无益的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.6.htm">30:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“南方牲畜”表那些拥有认知，或认知之光，却过着邪恶生活的人。“把财物驮在驴驹的脊背上”表属于其理性人的认知，“驴驹”是指理性真理（参看<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。“将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上”表属于其属世人的认知，“骆驼的肉鞍”是指属世之物。“骆驼”本身表那里的一般记忆知识，“宝物”是指他们视为宝贵的认知。“埃及的帮助是徒然无益的”表那记忆知识对他们来说是没有用的，“埃及”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>-<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>末尾等节）。很明显，“骆驼”在此不是指骆驼，因为经上说“少壮狮子和老狮子将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上”。谁都能看出，这段描述意味着教会的某种奥秘。<br /><br />论海之旷野的默示：主如此说，你去设立守望者，让他报告他所看见的。他看见一辆战车，一对一对的骑兵，一辆驴车、一辆骆驼车，就仔细听。他就回答说，巴比伦倾倒了，倾倒了！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.1.htm">21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“海之旷野”在此表没有用的记忆知识的空洞。“一辆驴车”表大量具体的记忆知识。“一辆骆驼车”表存在于属世人里面的大量一般记忆知识。那些“巴比伦”所指之人具有的空洞推理以这种方式来描述。<br /><br />你心就宽畅，因为大海丰盛的货物必转来归你，列族的财宝也必来归你。成群的骆驼并米甸和以法的独峰驼必遮满你。来自示巴的众人都必来到，要奉上黄金乳香，又要传说耶和华的赞美。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.5.htm">60:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这论及主和其属世人里面的神圣属天、属灵之物。“大海丰盛的货物”表属世真理的大量供应。“成群的骆驼”表一般记忆知识的大量供应。“黄金乳香”表良善与真理，也就是“耶和华的赞美”。“来自示巴”就是来自爱与信的属天之物（参看<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="117.htm">117</a>，<a href="1171.htm">1171</a>节）。示巴女王到耶路撒冷的所罗门这里来，带着大量财富，又有骆驼驮着香料和极多的金子、宝石（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.2.htm">2</a>），就代表来到主那里的智慧和聪明，就内义而言，主在此由所罗门来表示。“驮着香料、金子、宝石的骆驼”表示属世人里面的智慧和聪明之物。<br />耶利米书：<br />论巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒所攻打的基达和夏琐的诸国：你起来上基达去，毁灭东方人。他们的帐棚必拿去，幕帘，一切幔子，并骆驼为自己掠去。他们的骆驼必成为掠物，我必将它们分散四风。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.28.htm">49:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.32.htm">32</a>）<br />此处“基达和夏琐的诸国”在反面意义上表示那些拥有属天和属灵之物的认知，却只是利用它们使自己在自己和这个世界的眼里被视为智慧聪明的人。“那从他们那里被掠去成为掠物，并被分散四风的骆驼” 一般表那些人的记忆知识和他们对善与真的认知，这些东西在今生因他们相信相反的事而开始从他们那里被拿走，在来世则完全被夺去。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华用灾殃攻击那与耶路撒冷争战的列民；那临到马匹、骡子、骆驼、驴和一切牲畜的灾殃亦必如此。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.12.htm">14:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处“马匹、骡子、骆驼、驴的灾殃”表除去从理性概念到属世形像依次到来的理解力能力（关于“马”的意思，参看<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节；关于“骡子”的意思，参看<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节；关于“驴”的意思，参看<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。“骆驼”表属世人里面一般的记忆知识。埃及境内临到田间的牲畜、马、驴、骆驼、牛群、羊群上的瘟疫（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.2.htm">9:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.3.htm">3</a>）也有类似含义。<br />从这些经文明显可知，就圣言的内义而言，“骆驼”表属世人的一般记忆知识。一般记忆知识是指那些包含许多具体知识，这些具体知识又包含特定知识的知识。所有这些总体上构成属世人的理解力部分。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3048</b></p><p><b>3048.</b>
The servant took ten camels, of the camels of his lord, and departed. That this signifies general memory-knowledges in the natural man, is evident from the signification here of "servant," as being the 
natural man (see above, n. 3019, 3020) and from the signification of "ten," as being remains (that these are goods and truths with man stored up by the Lord, may be seen above, n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 
660, 661, 1050, 1906, 2284; and that "ten," or remains, when predicated of the Lord, are the Divine things which the Lord acquired for Himself, n. 1738, 1906); and also from the signification of "camels," 
as being general memory-knowledges; and because these were Divine, or acquired by the Lord, it is said that they were "ten," and then it is said that they were "camels, of the camels of his lord." 
That he "departed," signifies the initiation thereby which is treated of in this chapter. [2] The subject here is the process of the conjunction of truth with good in the Lord's Divine rational; 
first, the process of initiation (n. 3012-3013), the nature of which is described in a series; here, that the Lord separated in the natural man the things which were from Himself, that is, which were 
Divine, from those which were of the maternal. The things which were from Himself, or which were Divine, are the things by which the initiation was effected; and they are here the "ten camels, of the 
camels of his lord." And hence it is that in the following verses much mention is made of "camels" as that he made the camels fall on their knees without the city (verse 11); that Rebekah also gave drink 
to the camels (verses 14, 19-20); that they were brought into the house, and that straw and provender were given them (verses 31-32); and further, that Rebekah and her girls rode upon the camels 
(verse 61); and that Isaac saw the camels coming; and when Rebekah saw Isaac, that she alighted off her camel (verses 63-64). Camels are mentioned so often because of the internal sense, in which they 
signify the general memory-knowledges in the natural man, from which comes the affection of truth which is to be initiated into the affection of good in the rational, and this in the usual way, as shown 
above; for the rational as to truth cannot possibly be born and perfected without memory-knowledges and knowledges. [3] That "camels" signify general memory-knowledges is evident from other passages 
in the Word where they are mentioned, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The prophecy of the beasts of the south: In the land of straitness and distress; from whence come the young lion and the old lion, the viper 
and the flying fire serpent; they carry their riches upon the shoulder of young asses, and their treasures upon the hump of camels, to a people that shall not profit; for Egypt shall help in vain and 
to no purpose (Isa. 30:6-7). The "beasts of the south" denote those who are in the light of knowledges, or in knowledges, but in a life of evil; "carrying their riches upon the shoulder of young asses" 
denotes the knowledges pertaining to their rational (that a "young ass" is rational truth may be seen above, n. 2781); "their treasures upon the hump of camels," denotes the knowledges pertaining 
to their natural; the camels' "hump" is what is natural; the "camels" themselves signify the general memory-knowledges which are there; the "treasures" are the knowledges which they hold as precious; 
that "Egypt shall help in vain and to no purpose" denotes that memory-knowledges are of no use to them; that "Egypt" is memory-knowledge may be seen above (n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462, 2588 at the end). 
That "camels" here are not camels is plain; for it is said "the young lion and the old lion carry their treasures upon the hump of camels"; and anyone can see that some arcanum of the church is hereby 
signified. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     The prophecy of the wilderness of the sea: Thus hath the Lord said, Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth: and he saw a chariot, a pair of horsemen, a chariot 
of an ass, a chariot of a camel, and he hearkened diligently. And he answered and said, Babel is fallen, is fallen (Isa. 21:1, 6-7, 9). The "wilderness of the sea" here denotes the emptiness of memory-knowledges 
that are not for use; a "chariot of an ass," a collection of particular memory-knowledges; a "chariot of a camel," a collection of general memory-knowledges in the natural man. It is the 
empty reasonings with those signified by "Babel" which are thus described. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     Thy heart shall be enlarged because the multitude of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the wealth of 
the nations shall come unto thee. The abundance of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense, and they shall proclaim 
the praises of Jehovah (Isa. 60:5-6). This is concerning the Lord, and concerning the Divine celestial and spiritual things in His natural: the "multitude of the sea" denotes the immense supply 
of natural truth; the "wealth of the nations," the immense supply of natural good; the "abundance of camels," the abundant supply of general memory-knowledges; "gold and frankincense," goods and truths, 
which are the "praises of Jehovah;" "from Sheba" is from the celestial things of love and faith (see n. 113, 117, 1171). That: </p>
<p>The queen of Sheba came to Solomon to Jerusalem with exceeding great 
riches, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones (1 Kings 10:1-2) represented the wisdom and intelligence which came to the Lord, who in the internal sense here is "Solomon." 
The "camels bearing spices, gold, and precious stones" are the things of wisdom and intelligence in the natural man. [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     To Arabia, and to the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar 
king of Babel smote: Arise ye, go up to Arabia, and lay waste the sons of the East. Their tents shall they take, and they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, 
and their camels. And their camels shall be a booty, and I will scatter them to every wind (Jer. 49:28-29, 32). Here "Arabia and the kingdoms of Hazor," in the opposite sense, denote those who are in 
knowledges of celestial and spiritual things, but for the end of no other use than that they may be esteemed wise and intelligent by themselves and the world; the "camels which should be taken away 
from them, and should be for a booty, and should be scattered to every wind," are in general the memory-knowledges and the knowledges of good and truth which are also taken away from them in the life 
of the body by their believing contrary things, and in the other life wholly. [7] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that shall fight against 
Jerusalem; thus shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of every beast (Zech. 14:12, 15). Here the "plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the 
ass," denotes the privation of intellectual things, which thus succeed in order from rational things to natural things (what is meant by the "horse," may be seen above, n. 2761, 2762; what by the "mule" 
n. 2781; and what by the "ass," n. 2781); "camels" denote the general memory-knowledges in the natural man. The like was signified by the murrain in Egypt, which was "Upon the cattle in the field, 
upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon herd and upon flock" (Exod. 9:2-3). [8] From these passages it is evident that by "camels" in the internal sense of the Word are signified the 
general memory-knowledges of the natural man. General memory-knowledges are those which include in themselves many particulars, and these singulars; and they form in general the natural man as to the 
intellectual part of it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3048</b></p><p><b>3048.</b>
'The servant took ten camels from his master's camels, and went' means [Divine] general facts in the natural man. This is clear from the meaning of 'the servant' here as the natural man, dealt with above 
in <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, <a href="3020.htm">3020</a>; from the meaning of 'ten' as remnants, which are the goods and truths stored away in a person by the Lord, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a> (though when 'ten' or 
remnants is used in reference to the Lord, the Divine things that the Lord acquired to Himself are meant, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>); and from the meaning of 'camels' as general facts which, being Divine or things acquired 
by the Lord, are said to be 'ten' in number, and also to be 'camels from his master's camels'. The words 'he went' mean the introduction which was effected by means of those facts, which is dealt 
with in this chapter. The whole subject is the process by which truth was joined to good in the Lord's Divine Rational, the first thing to be described in this line of thought being the nature of 
the process of introduction, referred to in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>. The present verse describes how the Lord separated those things in the natural man that came from Himself, that is, that were Divine, from those 
that came from the mother. Those that came from Himself, or were Divine, are the things through which the introduction was effected, and they are meant here by 'the ten camels from his master's camels'. 
This explains why much reference is made in subsequent verses to camels, such as that he made the camels kneel down outside the city, verse 11; that Rebekah also gave the camels a drink, verses 14, 19, 20; that they were led into the house, and given straw and fodder, verses 31, 32; and further on, that Rebekah and her maids rode on the camels, verse 61; and that Isaac saw the camels coming, and 
that when Rebekah saw Isaac she dropped down from the camel, verses 63, 64. The reason they are mentioned so many times lies in the internal sense in which they mean the general facts that are present 
in the natural man and from which comes the affection for truth that had to be introduced to the affection for good within the rational, this being effected in the ordinary way, as shown above. For 
the rational as regards truth cannot possibly be born and perfected without facts and cognitions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'camels' means general facts is clear from other places in the Word where they are mentioned, 
as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A prophecy of the beasts of the south. In the land of distress and anguish are the young lion and the old lion from them, the viper and the flying fiery-serpent. They carry their 
wealth on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the backs of camels, to a people that do not profit them. And Egypt's help will be in vain and to no advantage. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The beasts 
of the south' stands for those who possess cognitions or the light of cognitions but lead evil lives. 'Carrying their wealth on the shoulders of young asses' stands for the cognitions which belong 
to their rational, 'a young ass' being rational truth, see <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. 'Their treasures on the backs of camels' stands for the cognitions which belong to their natural, 'the backs of camels' being the natural, 
'camels' themselves the general facts there, 'treasures' the cognitions which they consider to be precious. The words 'Egypt's help will be in vain and to no advantage' mean that to them knowledge 
is of no use, 'Egypt' being knowledge, see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a> (end). It is evident that camels are not meant by 'camels' here because it is said that the young lion and the old lion carry 
their treasures on the backs of camels. Anyone may see that some arcanum of the Church is meant by this description. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The prophecy of the wilderness of the sea. Thus said 
the Lord, Go, set a watchman to point out what he sees. And he saw a chariot, a pair of horsemen, a chariot of asses, a chariot of camels, and he listened diligently. He answered and said, Fallen, 
fallen has Babel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:1,%206,%207,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:1, 6, 7, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The wilderness of the sea' stands for the hollowness of knowledge that serves no use. 'A chariot of asses' stands for a mass of specific facts, 'a chariot of 
camels' for a mass of general facts which are present in the natural man. It is the hollow reasonings found with people meant by Babel which are described in this fashion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Your 
heart will enlarge itself because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you. A multitude of camels will cover you, dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, 
all those from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and will spread abroad the praises of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, and to the Divine celestial and spiritual 
things within His natural. 'The abundance of the sea' stands for a vast quantity of natural truth, 'the wealth of the nations' for a vast quantity of natural good. 'A multitude of camels' stands 
for general facts in abundance, 'gold and frankincense' for goods and truths which are 'the praises of Jehovah'. 'From Sheba' is from the celestial things of love and faith, see <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a>, <a href="1171.htm">1171</a>. The 
queen of Sheba's coming to Solomon in Jerusalem with vast amounts of wealth, with camels carrying spices, and very much gold, and precious stones, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 10:1, <a href="2.htm">2</a>, represented the wisdom and intelligence 
which came to the Lord, who in the internal sense of these verses is meant by Solomon. 'Camels carrying spices, gold, and precious stores' means matters of wisdom and intelligence in the natural man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>To Arabia and to the kingdoms of Hazor which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel smote: Arise and go up to Arabia, and lay waste the sons of the east. They will take their tents, their 
curtains, and all their vessels, and they will bear their camels away from them. Their camels will become booty, and the multitude of their flocks booty, and I will scatter them to every wind. Jer. 
49:28, <a href="29.htm">29</a>, <a href="32.htm">32</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'Arabia' and 'the kingdoms of Hazor', used in the contrary sense, stand for people who possess cognitions of celestial and spiritual things but whose only use for them is to 
be considered wise and intelligent in their own eyes and in those of the world. 'The camels that will be borne away from them to become booty and that will be scattered to every wind' means in general 
the factual knowledge of those people and their cognitions of good and truth, which will begin to be removed from these people in this life through their belief in things of a contrary nature, and in 
the next life removed altogether. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<p>The plague with which Jehovah will smite all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: It will be a plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, 
and the ass, and every beast. Zech. 14:12, <a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>
<p>'A plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, the ass' stands for the removal of the powers of the understanding which follow one another in the same 
consecutive order, from rational concepts to natural images. What a horse is, see <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>; a mule, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>; an ass, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. 'Camels' stands for general facts in the natural man. The pestilence in Egypt 
'on the cattle in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the herd, and on the flock', Exod. 9:2, <a href="3.htm">3</a>, had a similar meaning. </p>
<p>From all these places it becomes clear that 'camels' 
in the internal sense of the Word means general facts which belong to the natural man. General facts are those which include within themselves many particular ones, while these include within themselves 
those that are specific. All these constitute in general the understanding part of the natural man. </p>

`Sumpsit servus decem camelos {1}e camelis domini sui, et ivit': quod significet scientifica communia {2}in naturali homine constat a significatione `servi' hic quod sit naturalis homo, de qua supra 
n. 3019, 3020; a significatione `decem' quod sint reliquiae, quae quod sint bona et vera apud hominem recondita a Domino, videatur n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 1050, 1906, 2284; et cum decem seu 
reliquiae praedicantur de Domino, quod sint Divina, quae Dominus Sibi Ipsi acquisivit, n. 1738, 1906; et ex significatione `camelorum' quod sint scientifica communia, quae quia fuerunt Divina seu a Domino 
acquisita, dicitur quod fuerint `decem'; tum quod fuerint `cameli e camelis domini sui'; quod `iverit' significat initiationem per illa, de qua in hoc capite.  Agitur de processu conjunctionis veri 
cum bono in Divino Rationali Domini, primum de processu initiationis, n. 3012, 3013, qui qualis fuerit, in serie describitur; hic quod Dominus in naturali homine separaverit illa quae ab Ipso, hoc 
est, quae Divina fuerunt, ab illis quae ex materno; illa quae ab Ipso {3}seu quae Divina fuerunt, sunt per quae initiatio facta, et sunt hic `decem cameli e camelis domini sui'; inde est quod in sequentibus 
de camelis multum agatur, ut quod `in genua procumbere fecerit camelos extra urbem,' vers. 11: quod Rebecca etiam potaverit camelos, vers. 14, 19, 20: quod ducti in domum, et illis datam stramen 
et pabulum, vers. 31, 32 et porro, quod Rebecca et puellae ejus equitaverint super camelis, vers. 61: quodque Jishak viderit camelos venientes: et cum Rebecca vidit Jishakum, quod ceciderit de camelo, 
vers. 63, 64; quod toties memorantur, est causa sensus internus, in quo significant `scientifica communia' quae in naturali homine, ex quibus affectio veri quae initianda affectioni boni in rationali, 
et hoc secundum viam communem, ut supra ostensum; rationale enim quoad verum absque scientificis et cognitionibus nusquam potest nasci et perfici.  [2] Quod `cameli' significent scientifica communia, 
constat ex aliis  locis in Verbo, ubi nominantur, ut apud Esaiam,           Propheticum bestiarum meridiei: in terra angustiae et       angoris, leo juvenis et leo vetus ab illis, vipera et prester  
    volans, portant super humero asellorum opes suas, et super      dorso camelorum thesauros suos, ad populum non prosunt; et      Aegyptus vane et inaniter {4}auxiliabuntur, xxx 6, 7; </p>
<p>`bestiae 
meridiei' pro illis qui in luce cognitionum seu in cognitionibus, sed in vita mali sunt; `portare super humero asellorum opes suas' pro cognitiones quae illorum rationali; quod `asellus' sit verum 
rationale, videatur n. 2781; `super dorso camelorum thesauros suos' pro cognitiones quae illorum naturali; `dorsum camelorum' est naturale, ipsi `cameli' scientifica communia quae ibi, `thesauri' sunt 
cognitiones quas pro pretiosis habent; quod `Aegyptus vane et inaniter auxiliabuntur' est quod scientiae nullius usus illis; quod `Aegyptus' sit scientia, videatur n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 2588 f.; 
(m)quod `cameli' hic non sint cameli, patet, dicitur enim quod `leo juvenis et leo vetus {5}portant super dorso camelorum thesauros suos'; quisque videre potest quod aliquid arcanum Ecclesiae per id 
significetur {6}: [3] apud eundem,           Propheticum deserti maris:...sic dixit Dominus, Vade,       constitue speculatorem, quod {7}visurus indicabit; et vidit      {8}currum, par equitum, {8}currum 
asini, currum cameli, et      auscultavit auscultationem;...respondit et dixit, Cecidit,      cecidit Babel, xxi [1], 6, 7, 9; </p>
<p>`desertum maris' pro vanitate scientiarum quae non ob usum; `currus 
asini' pro congerie scientificorum particularium, `currus cameli' pro congerie scientificorum communium, quae in naturali homine; sunt ratiocinia vana {9} quae apud illos qui significantur per `Babel,' 
quae ita describuntur: [4] apud eandem,           Dilatabit se cor tuum, quia convertetur ad te multitudo      maris, {10}opes gentium venient tibi; copia camelorum obteget      te, dromades 
Midianis et Ephae, omnes illi e Sheba venient,      aurum et tus portabunt, et laudes Jehovae evangelizabunt, lx      5, 6; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino, ac de Divinis caelestibus et spiritualibus in Ipsius naturali; 
`multitudo maris' pro immensa copia veri naturalis, `opes gentium' pro immensa copia boni naturalis; `copia camelorum' pro abundantia communium scientificorum; `aurum et tus' pro bonis et veris 
quae sunt `laudes Jehovae'; `e Sheba' {11}est ex caelestibus amoris et fidei, videatur n. 113, 117, 1171: quod           Regina Shebae venerit ad Salomonem Hierosolymam opibus      magnis valde, camelis 
portantibus aromata et aurum multum      valde, et lapidem pretiosum, I Reg. x 1, 2, repraesentabat sapientiam et intelligentiam quae Domino accessit, Qui in sensu interno ibi est `Salomo'; `cameli 
portantes aromata, aurum et lapidem pretiosum' sunt illa quae sunt sapientiae et intelligentiae in naturali homine: [5] apud Jeremiam,           Ad Arabiam et ad regna Hazoris, quae percussit  
    Nebuchadnezzar rex Babelis; surgite et ascendite Arabiam, et      vastate filios orientis; tentoria eorum...sument, cortinas      eorum, et omnia vasa eorum, et camelos eorum auferent      illis;...et 
erunt cameli eorum in praedam, et multitudo      pecorum eorum in praedam, et dispergam eos in omnem ventum,      xlix 28, 29, 32; </p>
<p>`Arabia' hic et `regna Hazoris' in opposito sensu pro illis 
qui in cognitionibus caelestium et spiritualium, ob finem non alius usus quam ut sapientes et intelligentes audiant sibi et mundo; `cameli qui iis auferentur, {12}erunt in praedam, et dispergentur 
in omnem ventum' sunt in communi scientifica et cognitiones boni et veri, quae etiam illis auferuntur, in vita corporis per quod contraria credant, in altera vita prorsus: [6] apud Zachariam,        
   Plaga, qua percutiet Jehovah omnes populos, qui      pugnabunt contra Hierosolymam;...ita erit plaga equi, muli,      cameli, et asini, et omnis bestiae, xiv [12], 15; </p>
<p>`plaga equi, mali, cameli, 
asini' pro privatione intellectualium, quae ita ordine succedunt a rationalibus ad naturalia; quid equus, videatur n. 2761, 2762; quid mulus, n. 2781; quid asinus, n. 2781; `cameli' pro scientificis 
communibus in naturali homine.  `Pestis in Aegypto quae erat in pecus quod in agro, in equos, in asinos, in camelos, in armentum et in gregem,' Exod. ix 2, 3, similia significabat.  Ex his constare potest 
quod per `camelos' in Verbi sensu interno significentur scientifica communia quae sunt naturalis hominis.  Scientifica communia sunt quae in se comprehendunt plura particularia, et haec singularia, 
et formant in communi naturalem hominem quoad ejus intellectualem partem. @1 de A$  @2 i Divina$  @3 et for seu quae$  @4 Heb. for `Egypt' is Mizraim, a dual form (=upper and lower Egypt), hence 
the plural verb.$  @5 portabunt$  @6 i similiter ac per `humeris asellorum.'$  @7 videat$  @8 Heb.     (recheb)=chariot, but also riders, or a troop.$  @9 i de Divinis$  @10 n. 1259 has exercitus$
