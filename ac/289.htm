<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>289.</strong>对于“妻子”表教会，在宇宙义上，表主在天上和地上的国，这在前面也作了说明。基于此，“母”也是表教会。在圣经中，教会常被称为“母”，例如：“你们的母亲被休，休书在那里呢？”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.1.htm">50:1</a>）<br />又如：“你们的母极其抱愧，生你们的必然蒙羞。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.12.htm">50:12</a>）<br />再如：“你正是你母亲的女儿，厌弃丈夫和众子。你母亲是赫人，你父亲是亚摩利人。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.45.htm">16:45</a>）在此，“丈夫”表主并一切属天之性，“众子”表信之真理，“赫人”表虚假，“亚摩利人”表罪恶。<br />再如：“你的母亲先前如葡萄树，和你一样，栽于水旁。因为水多，就多结果子，满生枝子。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结19.10.htm">19:10</a>）在此，“母”表古教会。上古教会尤被称为“母”，因为它是首个教会，也是 唯一属天的教会，最得主的喜爱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]289.</strong> The meaning of a wife as the church and in a comprehensive sense as the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth has also been demonstrated before.{*1} It follows, then, that a mother has the same meaning.<br />The Word frequently uses mother for the church. Take Isaiah:<br />Where is your mother's document of divorce? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_50_1" target=_top>Isaiah 50:1</a>)<br />In Jeremiah:<br />Your mother has been acutely shamed; she who gave birth to you has blushed with embarrassment. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_50_12" target=_top>Jeremiah 50:12</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br /> [You are] your mother's daughter, showing disgust for her husband and her children. Your mother is a Hittite and your father an Amorite. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_45" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:45</a>)<br />The husband stands for the Lord and every heavenly quality, the children for religious truth. A Hittite stands for falsity and an Amorite for evil. In the same author:<br />Your mother was like a grapevine that resembled you, planted next to the water; fruitful, leafy was she, because of the many waters. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_19_10" target=_top>Ezekiel 19:10</a>)<br />The mother stands for the ancient church.<br />The earliest church is the main one to be called a mother, because it was the first and was also the only heavenly one, so that the Lord loved it above all others.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the meaning of a wife (or woman) as the church, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54" target=_top>54</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250" target=_top>250</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_252" target=_top>252-253</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_262" target=_top>262</a>. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29#subsection-2-2" target=_top>29:2</a> Swedenborg defines God's kingdom in the broadest sense as heaven and in a narrower sense as the church. [SS] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 289</b></p><p><b>289.</b>
It has also been shown above that by "wife" is meant the church, and in the universal sense the kingdom of the Lord in the heavens and on earth; and from this it follows that the same is meant by "mother." 
In the Word the church is very frequently called "mother" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement ? (Isa. 50:1). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Your mother is greatly ashamed: she 
that bare you was suffused with shame (Jer. 50: 12). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou art thy mother's daughter that loathed her man and her sons; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite (Ezek. 
16:45),  where "man [vir]" denotes the Lord and all that is celestial; "sons" the truths of faith; a "Hittite" what is false: and an "Amorite" what is evil. In the same: </p>
<p>     Thy mother is like a 
vine in thy likeness, planted near the waters; she was fruitful and full of leaves because of many waters (Ezek. 19:10). Here "mother" denotes the Ancient Church. The term "mother" is more especially 
applicable to the Most Ancient Church, because it was the first church, and the only one that was celestial, and therefore beloved by the Lord more than any other. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 289</b></p><p><b>289.</b>
'Wife' is used to mean the Church, in the universal sense the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth. This too has been shown already, while the fact that 'mother' as well has the same meaning follows 
from this. In the Word the Church is commonly called 'mother', as in Isaiah,   Where is your mother's bill of divorce? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2050:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 50:1</a>.   In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your, mother has been utterly shamed, she who 
bore you is covered with shame. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50:12</a>.   
</blockquote>
In Ezekiel,    [You are] your mother's daughter who loathes her husband and her sons. Your mother is a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:45</a>.  
 Here 'husband' (vir) stands for the Lord and everything celestial, 'sons for truths of faith, 'Hittite' for falsity, and 'Amorite' for evil. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your mother was like a vine 
in your likeness, planted beside the waters, fruitful, full of branches by reason of many waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2019:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 19:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'mother' stands for the Ancient Church. The Most Ancient Church is pre-eminently 
called a 'mother' because it was the first Church, and the only one to be celestial. For that reason it was the Lord's beloved more than any other.  </p>

</p><b>289.</b>
Quod per 'uxorem' intelligatur Ecclesia, in sensu universali regnum Domini in caelis et in terris, prius quoque ostensum est; quod etiam per 'matrem,' inde sequitur. Quod Ecclesia 'mater' dicatur, commune 
est in Verbo; ut apud Esaiam, 	Ubi est libellus repudii matris vestrae? l I: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Pudefacta est mater vestra valde, pudore suffusa est genitrix vestra, l 12: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, Filia 
matris tuae {1} fastidientis virum suum, et filios suos; mater vestra Hittaea, et pater vester Emoraeus, xvi 45; </p>
<p>ubi 'vir' pro Domino et pro omni caelesti, 'filii' pro veris fidei, 'Hittaea' pro falso, 
'Emoraeus' pro malo: apud eundem, Mater tua sicut vitis {2} in similitudine tui, juxta aquas plantata, frugifera, frondescens fuit ab aquis multis, xix 10; </p>
<p>hic 'mater' pro Antiqua Ecclesia. Antiquissima 
Ecclesia principaliter 'mater' dicitur, quia prima, ut et unica quae caelestis, et ideo prae omnibus amata a Domino. @  1 I has fastidiens as Hebrew, but in De Amore Conjugiali n.119 S. fastidietis 
showing that it refers to matris not filiae.$ @  2 S. has this in every other place he quotes it; A.V. and R.V. have 'in thy blood,' but R.V. in margin has 'or, in thy likeness.'$ </p>
