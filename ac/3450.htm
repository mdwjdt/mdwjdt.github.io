Verses 28, 29. And they said, Seeing we have seen that Jehovah was with thee; and we said, Now let there be an oath between us, between us and thee, and let us cut out a covenant with thee. If thou shalt 
do evil to us, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of Jehovah. "And they said, Seeing we have seen 
that Jehovah was with thee," signifies that they knew the Divine was therein; "and we said, Now let there be an oath between us, between us and thee, and let us cut out a covenant with thee," signifies 
that regarded in themselves the doctrinal things of their faith should not be denied; "if thou shalt do evil to us, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and 
have sent thee away in peace," signifies that they have not done violence to the internal sense of the Word, and that they would not do violence to it; "thou art now the blessed of Jehovah," signifies 
that it was from the Divine. </p>

Verses 28, 29 And they said, We saw clearly that Jehovah was with you, and we said, Let there be now a solemn agreement between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you. If you do 
us no harm as we have not touched you and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace; you are now the blessed of Jehovah. </p>
<p>'They said, We saw clearly that Jehovah was with 
you' means that they knew the Divine to be present within it. 'And we said, Let there be now a solemn agreement between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you' means that their 
matters of doctrine concerning faith, regarded in themselves, should not be refused recognition. 'That you do us no harm as we have not touched you and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have 
sent you away in peace' means that they had not done and would not do violence to the internal sense of the Word. 'You are now the blessed of Jehovah' means that it came from the Divine. </p>

Vers. 28, 29.  Et dixerunt, Videndo vidimus quod fuit Jehovah cum te, et diximus, Sit quaeso sacramentum inter nos, inter nos et inter te, et excidamus foedus cum te. Si facias cum nobis malum, quemadmodum 
non tetigimus te, et quemadmodum fecimus cum te tantummodo bonum, et misimus te in pace; tu nunc benedictus Jehovae. `Dixerunt, Videndo vidimus quod fuit Jehovah cum te' significat quod scirent 
Divinum inesse: `et diximus, Sit quaeso sacramentum inter nos, inter nos et inter te, et excidamus foedus cum te' significat quod doctrinalia fidei eorum in se spectata non negarentur: `si facias eum 
nobis malum, quemadmodum non tetigimus te, et quemadmodum fecimus cum te tantummodo bonum, et misimus te in pace' significat quod non violaverint internum sensum Verbi et quod non violarent: `tu nunc 
benedictus Jehovae' significat quod a Divino. </p>
