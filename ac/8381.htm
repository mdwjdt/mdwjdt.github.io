<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8381.</strong>当木星灵观看我们地球上的马时，我觉得这些马似乎比平常的时候小，尽管事实上，它们相当健壮、高大。这是由于木星灵对他们自己的马所持的观念。他们说，他们也有类似的马，但体格大多了；这些马是野生的，或生活在森林里；一看见它们，人们就被它们惊吓，尽管它们完全无害。他们补充说，他们对马恐惧是与生俱来的，或先天的。这给予他们机会去思想这种恐惧的原因。因为在灵界，一匹马在灵义上代表由记忆知识所形成的理解力（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="6534.htm">6534</a>节）；他们因害怕通过知识培养这种能力，所以就害怕进入它们。下文我们会看到，他们对属于人类学问的记忆知识不感兴趣。</p>

When the spirits of Jupiter saw the horses of this earth, these horses appeared to me smaller than usual, although they were quite stout and high. This was from the idea of the spirits of that earth 
about their own horses. They said that they also have similar horses, but much larger, and that they are wild, or in the forests; and that when they are seen, they terrify them, although they are harmless. 
They added that a fear of horses is innate, or natural to them. This led to reflection on the cause of this fear. For in the spiritual world a horse represents the understanding formed from memory-knowledges 
(n. 2760-2762, 6534); and as they fear to cultivate the understanding by means of the sciences, it causes an influx of fear. That they do not care for the memory-knowledges that pertain 
to human erudition, will be seen in what follows. </p>

When the spirits from Jupiter saw horses belonging to our planet those horses seemed to me to be smaller than usual, though in fact they were quite powerful and tall ones. This was due to the idea that 
spirits from that planet had about the horses there. They said that their horses were similar yet much larger, but that they are wild or live in forests and that when caught sight of they terrify people, 
although they are completely harmless. They added that their fear of them is innate or natural. This gave them an opportunity to think about the cause of that fear. In the spiritual world a horse 
represents an understanding formed from factual knowledge, <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>-<a href="2763.htm">2763</a>, <a href="6534.htm">6534</a>; and since they fear to cultivate their understanding by means of knowledge, fear therefore enters them. The fact that they 
have no interest in the factual knowledge belonging to human learning will be seen further on. </p>

Spiritus Joviales cum viderent equos hujus telluris, apparebant {1}equi mihi solito minores, tametsi erant satis robusti et alti; hoc fuit ex idea spirituum illius telluris de equis ibi; dicebant quod 
etiam apud illos essent similes, at multo majores, sed quod sint feri seu in silvis, et quod cum visuntur, terrificent illos, tametsi nihil nocent; addebant quod pro illis sit timor insitus seu naturalis; 
inde dabatur ansa cogitandi de causa illius timoris; equus enim repraesentat in spirituali mundo intellectuale formatum ex scientificis, n. 2761-2763, 6534, et quia timent excolere intellectuale 
per scientias, inde influxus timoris; quod scientifica quae eruditionis humanae sunt non curent, videbitur in sequentibus. 	@1 illi$ </p>
