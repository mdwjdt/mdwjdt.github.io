<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4446节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4446.</strong>创世记34:8-12.哈抹和他们谈话，说，我的儿子示剑，他的灵魂恋慕你们的女儿，求你们将她给示剑为妻。你们与我们结亲，你们可以把女儿给我们，也可以娶我们的女儿。你们与我们同住吧！这地都在你们面前，只管在此居住，做买卖，置产业。示剑对她父亲和弟兄们说，但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩，你们向我要什么，我都会给。任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物，我必照你们向我所说的给你们，只要把这少女给我为妻。<br />“哈抹和他们谈话，说”表古人当中的教会之良善。“我的儿子示剑”表源于这良善的真理。“他的灵魂恋慕你们的女儿，求你们将她给示剑为妻”表与这个外表类似古教会的新教会结合的渴望。“你们与我们结亲，你们可以把女儿给我们，也可以娶我们的女儿”表良善与真理的联姻。“你们与我们同住吧”表生活。“这地都在你们面前，只管在此居住”表将要合一的教会。“做买卖，置产业”表因他们交流而将彼此一致的教义。“示剑对她父亲和弟兄们说”表源于古代神性支系的真理和该宗教表象的良善与真理所进行的商议。“但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩，你们向我要什么，我都会给”表若他们这一方和他想得一样。“任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物，我必照你们向我所说的给你们”表他将接受存在于他们当中的事物，并把它们变成他自己的。“只要把这少女给我为妻”表只要产生结合。</p>

Verses 8-12. And Hamor spoke with them, saying, Shechem my son, his soul longs for your daughter; give her I pray to him for a woman. And share kinships with us; give your daughters to us, and take our 
daughters to you. And ye shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you, dwell ye, and range through it trading, and get you possession therein. And Shechem said unto her father and unto her 
brothers, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye say unto me I will give. Multiply upon me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I will give as ye say unto me; and give me the damsel for a woman. "And 
Hamor spoke with them, saying," signifies the good of the Church among the Ancients; "Shechem my son," signifies the truth thence derived; "his soul longs for your daughter, give her I pray to him for 
a woman," signifies a desire for conjunction with this new church which appears in outward form like the Ancient Church; "and share kinships with us, give your daughters to us, and take our daughters 
to you," signifies a union of goods and truths; "and ye shall dwell with us," signifies life; "and the land shall be before you, dwell ye," signifies the church which would be one; "and range through 
it trading, and get you possession therein," signifies doctrinal tenets from what is general that would agree together; "and Shechem said unto her father and unto her brothers," signifies a consultation 
of the truth from the ancient Divine stock with the good and truth of this religiosity; "let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye say unto me I will give," signifies if they had a like mind on 
their side to what he had on his; "multiply upon me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I will give as ye say unto me," signifies that he will accept the things that are with them, and will make them his 
own; "and give me the damsel for a woman," signifies provided there is conjunction. </p>

Verses 8-12 And Hamor spoke to them, saying, Shechem my son, his soul longs for your daughter; give her, I beg you, to him for a wife. And intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our 
daughters to yourselves. And you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you; dwell, and carry on trade throughout it, and have possessions in it. And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, 
Let me find grace in your eyes, and I will give that which you tell me. Increase the dowry and gift to any size,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and I will give whatever you tell me, and give me the young woman for a wife. </p>
<p>'Hamor 
spoke to them, saying' means the good of the Church among the Ancients. 'Shechem my son' means the truth derived from that good. 'His soul longs for your daughter; give her, I beg you, to him 
for a wife' means a longing to be joined to this new Church which in outward appearance was similar to the Ancient Church. 'And intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters 
to yourselves' means the union of goods and truths. 'And you shall dwell with us' means life. 'And the land shall be before you; dwell' means the Church which would be one. 'Carry on trade throughout 
it, and have possessions in it' means matters of doctrine which, because they are communicated, would accord with one another. 'And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers' means counsel taken 
by the truth from the ancient Divine stock with the good and truth of this semblance of religion. 'Let me find grace in your eyes, and I will give that which you tell me' means that if they on their 
part were similar in mind to him on his part. 'Increase the dowry and gift to any size, and I will give whatever you tell me' means that he will accept the things which exist with them and will make those 
things his own. 'And give me the young woman for a wife' means provided the joining together takes place.

Vers. 8-12.  Et locutus Hamor cum illis dicendo, Shechem filius meus desiderat anima illius in filiam vestram, detis quaeso eam illi ad mulierem.  Et affinitates societis cum nobis, filias vestras 
detis nobis, et filias nostras accipiatis vobis. Et cum nobis habitetis, et terra erit coram vobis, habitate, negotiando pervagamini eam, et possidete in ea.  Et dixit Shechem ad patrem ejus, et 
ad fratres ejus, inveniam gratiam in oculis vestris, et quod dicitis ad me, dabo.  Multiplicate super me valde dotem et donum, et dabo quemadmodum dicitis ad me, et detis mihi puellam ad mulierem. 
`Locutus Hamor cum illis dicendo' significat bonum Ecclesiae apud antiquos: `Shechem filius meus' significat verum inde: `desiderat anima illius in filiam vestram, detis quaeso eam illi ad mulierem' 
significat desiderium conjunctionis cum nova hac quae apparet externa facie antiquae similis: `et affinitates societis cum nobis, filias vestras detis nobis, et filias nostras accipiatis vobis' significat 
unionem bonorum et verorum: `et cum nobis habitetis' significat vitam: `et terra erit coram vobis, habitate' significat Ecclesiam quae una: `negotiando pervagamini eam, et possidete in ea' 
significat dogmata ex communi quae consensura: `et dixit Shechem ad patrem ejus et ad fratres ejus' significat consultationem veri ex antiqua Divina stirpe cum bono et vero hujus religiosi: `Inveniam 
gratiam in oculis vestris, et quod dicitis ad me, dabo' significat si illis mens similis a sua parte, quod esset a sua: `multiplicate super me valde dotem et donum, et dabo quemadmodum dicitis 
ad me' significat quod acceptabit illa quae apud illos, et faciet sua {1}: `et detis mihi puellam ad mulierem' significat modo conjunctio.      @1 suae I$ </p>
