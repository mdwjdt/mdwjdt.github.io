Verses 3-5. And Moses came and reported to the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words that Jehovah hath spoken we 
will do. And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent youths of the 
sons of Israel, and they offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace sacrifices of bullocks to Jehovah. "And Moses came and reported to the people," signifies the enlightenment and instruction of 
the Lord through the Divine truth which is from Him; "all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments," signifies the things in the Word that belong to life in the spiritual and in the natural state; 
"and all the people answered with one voice," signifies reception with the understanding by those who are truly of the church; "and they said, All the words that Jehovah hath spoken we will do," signifies 
reception then in the heart; "and Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah," signifies thereafter an impressing on the life; "and rose up early in the morning," signifies joy from the Lord; "and built 
an altar under the mountain," signifies a representative of the Divine Human of the Lord in respect to the Divine good from Him; "and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel," signifies a representative 
of the Divine Human of the Lord in respect to the truth Divine which is from Him, in its whole complex; "and he sent youths of the sons of Israel," signifies the things of innocence and charity; 
"and they offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace sacrifices of bullocks to Jehovah," signifies a representative of the worship of the Lord from good and from the truth which is from good. </p>
