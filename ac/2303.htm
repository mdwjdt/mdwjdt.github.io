<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2303节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2303.</strong>在前上方的天使灵以未分成词语的天使般的语言和我说话，声称其状态是平安宁静的状态，她们当中也有小孩子，并且她们通过与这些小孩子同在而得到幸福感。这些灵人也是女性成员。关于世上的婴儿，她们进一步说，他们一出生，来自纯真天堂的天使就与他们在一起。然后，随着年龄增长，与之同在的是来自平安宁静天堂的天使，之后是来自仁爱社群的天使，再后来，随着小孩子所具有的纯真和仁爱逐渐褪却，其他天使会与他们同在。最后，他们年龄越来越大，并融入与仁爱格格不入的生活中。此时，天使固然在场，但距离十分遥远。这一过程与生命的目的一致，天使尤其通过不断注入良善的目的，摒弃邪恶的目的而调整这生命的目的。随着他们能或不能这样做，天使更近或更远地流入进来。</p>

Angelic spirits who were above in front spoke with me in angelic speech not distinguished into words, saying that their state was a state of the tranquillity of peace, and that there were also little 
children among them, and that they were conscious of blessedness from being in association with them; these spirits also were of the female sex. They said further concerning infants on earth, that directly 
after birth angels from the heaven of innocence are with them; in the succeeding age angels from the heaven of the tranquillity of peace; and afterwards those who are from the societies of charity; 
and then, as the innocence and charity with the young children decrease, other angels are with them; and at length, when they become older and enter into a life foreign to charity, angels are indeed 
present, but more remotely, and this in accordance with the ends of life, which the angels especially regulate by continually insinuating good ones, and turning aside evil ones; and they flow in more 
nearly or more remotely, in proportion as they can or cannot do this. </p>

Angelic spirits who were above and in front spoke to me in angelic language that was not divided into separate expressions. They said that their state was the state of a serenity of peace, and that they 
also had young children among them, from whose presence with them they received a feeling of bliss. Those spirits too were members of the female sex. They went on to speak about young children on 
earth. They said that immediately after these are born, angels from the heaven of innocence are present with them; then in the next phase of their life angels from the heaven of the serenity of peace; 
after that angels from the communities of charity; and then, as innocence and charity diminish when they are older children, different angels again are present with them. And when at length they become 
more grown up and enter upon a life alien to charity, angels are indeed present though more remotely, but in accordance with the ends of life which are especially regulated by the angels by a continual 
instillation by them of ends that are good and a turning aside of ends that are bad. But to the extent they are able or are not able to do this, so they flow in more nearly or more remotely. </p>

Spiritus angelici qui (t)superne antrorsum, mecum locuti loquela angelica, non distincta in voces, dicentes quod status eorum esset status tranquillitatis pacis, et quod apud eos essent quoque infantes, 
et quod ab eorum consortio perciperent beatitudinem; erant quoque illi spiritus ex sexu feminino.  Locuti porro de infantibus in tellure, quod apud eos statim post nativitate' sint angeli e caelo 
innocentiae; succedente aetate angeli e caelo tranquillitatis pacis; postea qui e societatibus charitatis; et dein, sicut innocentia et charitas apud infantes liberos decrescit, alii angeli; et tandem 
cum adultiores fiunt et intrant in vitam a charitate alienam, quod (t)quidem angeli adsint sed remotius, et hoc secundum fines vitae quos angeli imprimis regunt, bonos jugiter insinuando et malos avertendo; 
at {1} quantum hoc possunt aut non possunt, [tantum] propius aut remotius influunt. 	@1 et.$ </p>
