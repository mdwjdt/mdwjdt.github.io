<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1639节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1639.</strong>如前所述，话语构成的言语适合世人，事实上适合他的肉体记忆；而思想观念构成的言语适合灵人，事实上适合内在记忆，也就是灵人的记忆。世人并不知道他们拥有内在记忆。因为属肉体的具体事物或物质事物的记忆是一切，并模糊了内在记忆。然而，若没有适合其灵的内在记忆，人根本无法思考。我经常通过内在记忆，因而以灵人自己的语言，也就是思想观念与他们交谈。至于这种语言何等普遍和丰富，这可从以下事实看出来：每句话都包含非常广泛的观念，因为众所周知，一句话所具有的一个观念可用很多话来阐述。属于一个具体主题的一个观念更是如此，属于众多主题的一个观念尤其如此，这些主题可以汇集成一个看似一个简单整体的复合观念。由此可见，灵人们在一起自然使用的言语是何性质，世人通过这种言语与灵人结合。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1639.</strong> Verbal speech, as I said, is characteristic of people on earth and, to be specific, of their physical memory.{*1} Speech composed of thoughts, however, is the speech of spirits and, to be specific, of inner memory, which is the memory of the spirit. We are not aware that we have the latter kind of memory, because the memory of trivia belonging to the material world 钬?physical memory 钬?seems all-important and overshadows the inner memory. The reality, though, is that without the inner memory characteristic of our spirit, we are completely incapable of thought.<br />I have often used my inner memory in talking with spirits, which is to say that I have used their own language; that is, I have spoken by means of thought. The universality of the language and its richness can be seen from the fact that each word contains a whole concept of tremendous reach. As we know, it can take some time to lay out the thought behind a single word, still more the thought behind a single topic, and more yet the thought behind a constellation of topics, even if these can be brought together into a single, simple-looking composite. These considerations give some clue to the kind of speech that spirits naturally use with each other and what type of speech it is that links us to spirits.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg defines physical memory in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1639/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4901#subsection-2-3" target=_top>4901:3</a> as the faculty of memory we possess during physical life. He discusses this outer memory and inner, spiritual memory at length in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1639/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2469" target=_top>2469-2494</a>.

The speech of words, as has been said, is the speech proper to man, and in fact to his corporeal memory; but the speech of ideas of thought is the speech of spirits, and in fact of the interior memory, 
which is the memory of the spirit. Men are not aware that they have this memory, because the memory of particulars, or of material things, which is corporeal, is everything, and obscures the interior 
memory; when yet without the interior memory, which is proper to his spirit, man cannot think at all. From this memory I have often spoken with spirits, thus in their own language, that is, by ideas 
of thought. How universal and copious this language is, may be seen from the fact that every word contains an idea of great extension; for it is well known that the single idea of a word may be set 
forth by many words; and this is still more true of the idea of one whole subject, and still more so of the idea of a number of such subjects, which can be brought together into one compound idea that 
still appears as simple; from which may be seen what is the quality of the natural speech of spirits among themselves, and by means of which speech man is conjoined with spirits. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1639</b></p><p><b>1639.</b>
Speech composed of words, as has been stated, is the speech that belongs properly to man, and indeed to his bodily memory, whereas speech composed of ideas comprising thought is the speech that belongs 
to spirits, and indeed to the interior memory, which is the memory possessed by the spirit. Men are not aware of having this interior memory because the memory of particulars, that is, of material 
things, which is of a bodily nature, is everything and obscures the interior memory. Yet without the interior memory, which belongs properly to his spirit, man is unable to think at all. I have spoken 
to spirits quite often by means of that memory, and so in their own language, that is, through the ideas that are part of thought. How universal and abundant that language is becomes clear from the fact 
that every word holds within itself an idea that is wide-ranging; for it is well known that a single idea which a word possesses may be set forth by the use of many words. This is even more true of 
an idea belonging to one particular subject, and truer still of an idea belonging to many such subjects, which may be drawn together into one composite idea which nevertheless seems to be a simple whole. 
These considerations show what the speech is like which comes naturally to spirits when with one another and by means of which man is joined to spirits. </p>

</p><b>1639.</b>
Loquela vocum, ut dictum, est loquela propria hominum, et quidem memoriae ejus corporeae, at loquela idearum cogitationis est loquela spirituum, et quidem memoriae interioris quae est memoria spiritus; 
hanc homines non sciunt se habere, quia memoria particularium seu materialium quae corporea est, omne facit et obfuscat interiorem, cum tamen homo absque memoria interiore, ejus spiritus propria, 
nihil potest cogitare; ex hac memoria saepius locutus sum cum spiritibus, ita lingua eorum propria, hoc est, per ideas cogitationis; quae lingua quam universalis et copiosa sit, constare potest ex eo 
quod unaquaevis vox habeat ideam multae extensionis, nam notam est quod una vocis idea multis exponi possit, magis idea unius rei, et magis adhuc plurium, quae conferri possunt in unam compositam, apparentem 
usque ut simplicem; ex quibus constare potest qualis est loquela naturalis spirituum inter se, et per quam loquelam homo conjungitur spiritibus. </p>
