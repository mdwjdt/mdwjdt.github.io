Wide experience has shown me that when people come into the next life they do not realize they are there. They think they are still in the world and in fact in their bodies. They are so convinced of this that if you tell them they are spirits, they are amazed and dumbfounded, for two reasons. One is that they seem completely human in respect to their senses, desires, and thoughts. The other is their previous disbelief, when they lived in the world, that they were spirits or (in some cases) that spirits could even be like this. </p>

CHAPTER 4 ON THE NATURE OF THE LIFE OF THE SOUL OR SPIRIT. With regard to the general subject of the life of souls, that is, of novitiate spirits, after death, I may state that much experience has 
shown that when a man comes into the other life he is not aware that he is in that life, but supposes that he is still in this world, and even that he is still in the body. So much is this the case that 
when told he is a spirit, wonder and amazement possess him, both because he finds himself exactly like a man, in his senses, desires, and thoughts, and because during his life in this world he had 
not believed in the existence of the spirit, or, as is the case with some, that the spirit could be what he now finds it to be. </p>

that when a person enters the next life he is not aware of being in that life. He imagines that he is still in the world, indeed that he is still within his physical body, insomuch that when he is told 
he is a spirit he is absolutely dumbfounded. He is dumbfounded because, for one thing, he is still in every way a man as regards sensations, desires, and thoughts, and for another, he did not during 
his lifetime believe in the existence of the spirit, or as is the case with some, that the spirit could possibly be such as his experience now proves.  </p>

GENESEOS CAPUT QUARTUM Qualis vita Animae seu Spiritus </p>
<p>QUOD in genere spectat vitam animarum seu recentium spirituum post mortem, multis experientiis constiterat quod homo dum in alteram vitam 
venit, non sciat quod in altera vita sit, putans quod adhuc in mundo, immo in suo corpore; usque adeo ut cum ei dicitur quod sit spiritus, quod miretur et obstupescat; tam ex causa quod prorsus sit sicut 
homo quoad sensus, cupiditates et cogitationes, quam ex eo quod non crediderit cum vixit in mundo, quod spiritus sit, et quidam, quod spiritus non possit esse talis. </p>
