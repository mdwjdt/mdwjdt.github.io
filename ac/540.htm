<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第540节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>540.</strong>进入灵界的人，几乎都对天堂之福与乐的性质一无所知。因为他们不知何为内在的快乐，不了解其性，唯有以属肉体、属世界的快乐来衡量。既然不知，也就以为它不存在。然事实上，属肉体属世界的快乐相对而言根本微不足道，并且肮脏污秽。为了让不了解天堂之乐的诚实人有所了解，他们先被带到超乎其想象的花园之中（对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述）。这些人以为进入了天堂乐园，却被告知，那还不是真正的天堂之乐。所以他们被允许进入更内在的快乐状态，直到他们有最深的感受。之后又被带到抵达其至内在的平安状态，他们承认，这一切根本无法想象，难以形容。最后，他们被带到纯真的状态，直到他们有最深的感受。以此方式他们得以认识何为真正的属灵、属天之善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]540.</strong> Almost no one coming into the other life understands what the blessings and happiness of heaven are, since they do not know what deep-seated joy is or what it feels like. They can grasp it only in relation to bodily and worldly kinds of happiness and joy, and whatever they do not know about they consider worthless. Nevertheless, bodily and worldly thrills are relatively worthless and filthy.<br />In order for those who are honest but ignorant to learn what heavenly joy is and to come to recognize it, they are introduced first into scenes of paradise that surpass anything they could ever have imagined. (With the Lord's divine mercy, these scenes will be described further on [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_540/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1622" target=_top>1622</a>]). They suppose they have now entered the heavenly paradise, but they are taught that this is not the true happiness of heaven. Next they experience profound states of joy in their deepest core. Afterward they are carried into a state of peace reaching to the same deep level. They confess that nothing about that peace could ever be captured in word or thought. Finally they are brought into a state of innocence that again reaches right to their deepest level of sensation. This allows them to recognize what true good is like on the spiritual and heavenly planes. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 540</b></p><p><b>540.</b>
Almost all who come into the other life are ignorant of the nature of heavenly happiness and bliss, because they know not the nature and quality of inward joy. They form a conception of it merely from 
the delights and joys of the body and the world. What they are ignorant of they suppose to be nothing, the truth being that bodily and worldly joys are relatively non-existent and foul. In order therefore 
that those who are well disposed may learn and may know what heavenly joy is, they are taken in the first place to paradises that surpass every conception of the imagination (concerning which, 
of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter), and they suppose that they have arrived in the paradise of heaven; but they are taught that this is not true heavenly happiness, and are therefore permitted to experience 
interior states of joy which are perceptible to their inmost being. They are then transported into a state of peace, even to their inmost being, and they confess that nothing of it is at all 
expressible or conceivable. And finally they are introduced into a state of innocence, also to their inmost feeling. In this way are they permitted to learn the nature of true spiritual and celestial good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 540</b></p><p><b>540.</b>
Almost everybody entering the next life is ignorant of what heavenly blessedness and happiness are, for people do not know what internal joy is, or the nature of it. They gain a conception of it solely 
through bodily and worldly delights and joys. Consequently that of which they are ignorant they imagine to be nothing. But in fact bodily and worldly joys are by contrast worthless and foul. Therefore 
so that upright persons who do not know what heavenly joy is may come to know and recognize it they are taken first of all to the gardens there, which surpass anyone's entire imagination. These will 
in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. These persons now suppose that they have entered the heavenly paradise, but they are taught that even this is not true heavenly happiness, and so they 
are then given to know about the inward states of joy that enter their inmost being. After this they are brought into a state of peace that reaches to their inmost being, at which point they declare 
that no part of such experience could possibly be expressed in words or even conceived of. Finally they are brought into a state of innocence, and this too reaches their inmost feelings. In this way 
they are given to know what true spiritual and celestial goodness is.  </p>

</p><b>540.</b>
Fere omnes qui in alteram vitam veniunt, ignorant quid beatitudo et felicitas caelestis, quia quid et quale gaudium internum nesciunt; solum ex laetitiis et gaudiis corporeis et mundanis perceptionem 
capiunt; quare quod ignorant, nihil esse putant; eum tamen gaudia corporea et mundana sunt nihili et spurci respective; ideo probi qui non sciunt quid gaudium caeleste, ut sciant et cognoscant, feruntur 
primum ad paradisiaca, quae omnem imaginationis ideam excedunt, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; tunc arbitrati venisse in paradisum caelestem; sed docentur quod id non sit 
felicitas vere caelestis, quare datur iis cognoscere status interiores gaudii ad intimum eorum perceptibiles; dein auferantur in statum pacis, usque ad intimum eorum, fatentes tunc quod nihil ejus 
usquam expressibile sit nec cogitabile: denique in statum innocentiae, etiam usque ad sensum eorum intimum: inde nosse iis datur quid vere bonum spirituale et caeleste. </p>
