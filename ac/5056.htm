<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5056节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5056.</strong>一个来自另一个星球的灵人与我同在（关于这些灵人，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在别说论及），他恳求我为他代祷，好叫他能进入天堂。他说，他没有意识到自己做了坏事；他只是责备了那个星球的居民（他的星球上有些灵人会责备并惩戒那些不过正确生活的人，我在谈及其它星球的居民时也会描述这些人）。他补充说，责备后他又教导了他们；他说这话时似乎声音哽咽，所以也有激起同情心的能力。但我只能回答说，我无法给予他任何帮助，进入天堂唯独靠主；但他若配得，就有希望。然而这时，他被送回属于他自己星球的正直灵人当中；可这些灵人说，他不能与他们在一起，因为他和他们不一样。然而，因出于强烈的渴望，他再三要求被允许进入天堂，于是被送到这个星球的正直灵人的社群那里；但这些灵人也说，他不能与他们在一起。他在天堂之光中显得发黑，尽管他自称他不是黑色，而是棕色。<br />我被告知，像这类人在被接入那些构成精囊区域的人当中之前，一开始都是这样；因为精子（精液）连同与其融合的液体都积聚在这些囊泡中。这种融合使得精子处在适当条件下，以便它一旦被排出，就从子宫颈的液体中被释放出来，从而有助于实现怀孕。这种物质也含有一种努力在里面，可以说渴望实现这个目的，进而抛掉包裹它的液体。只见与之类似的事发生在这个灵人身上。他回到我这里，但现在却衣衫褴褛，又说他有上天堂的强烈渴望，并且觉得自己现在处于适合留在那里的状态。我蒙引导对他说，这或许表明他将很快被接纳。然后，天使叫他脱下衣服；他在渴望中如此迅速脱下来，以至于再没有比这更迅速的了。这表现了那些在与精囊相对应的区域中之人的强烈渴望是何性质。</p>

A certain spirit from another earth was with me (of which spirits from other earths of the Lord's Divine mercy I shall speak elsewhere), and he anxiously begged me to intercede for him, that he might 
come into heaven. He said that he was not aware of having done what is evil, except that he had rebuked the inhabitants of that earth (for there are spirits who chide and chastise those who do not live 
rightly, who also will be described when I speak of the inhabitants of other earths). He added that after chiding he instructed them. He then talked with as it were a broken voice, and he could move 
one to pity. But I could only reply that I could give him no help, and that admission into heaven is of the Lord alone, but that if worthy he might hope. He was then sent back among upright spirits 
from his own earth; but these said that he could not be in their company, because he was not such as they were. Yet because with intense longing he importuned to be let into heaven, he was sent into a 
society of upright spirits of this earth; but these also said that he could not remain with them. In the light of heaven he was of a black color; but he himself said that he was not of a black, but of 
a murrhine color.  [2] I was told that they are such in the beginning who are afterward received among those who constitute the province of the seminal vesicles; for in these vesicles is collected 
the semen with its proper serum with which it is combined and thereby rendered fit, after it has been emitted, to be resolved in the neck of the womb, and thus to be serviceable for conception; and there 
is in such a substance an endeavor and as it were a longing to perform a use, thus to put off the serum with which it is clothed. Something similar showed itself in this spirit. He came again to me, 
but in vile clothing, and said that he was burning to come into heaven, and that he now perceived that he was fit for it. I was given to tell him that perhaps this was an indication that he would soon 
be received. He was then told by angels to cast off his garment; and in his longing he cast it off so quickly that scarcely anything could be quicker. By this was represented the nature of the ardent 
desires of those who are in the province to which the seminal vesicles correspond. </p>

A certain spirit from another planet was once present with me. (Spirits from other planets will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken about elsewhere.) He asked me earnestly to intercede on his behalf 
to enable him to enter heaven. He said he was not aware of having done what was evil, only of having reprimanded inhabitants of that planet; for on his planet there are people who reprimand and chastise 
others when they do not lead correct lives. (Reference will be made to these people too when the inhabitants of other planets are dealt with.) That spirit added that after he reprimanded people he 
instructed them; and as he said this his voice seemed to crack. He also had the ability to arouse feelings of pity. The only answer I could give him however was that I was unable to help him in any way. 
Entrance into heaven, I told him, rested with the Lord alone; but if he was worthy he could entertain the hope of gaining it. At that point however he was sent back to be among upright spirits who 
belonged to his own planet; but those spirits said that he could not remain in their company because he was not like them. Nevertheless because his intense desire made him demand that he should be let 
into heaven, he was sent to a community of upright spirits belonging to our own planet. But these too told him that he could not remain with them. In addition to this his colour seen in the light of 
heaven was black, though he himself said it was not black but a ruddy brown. </p>

 I was told that this is what people of this sort are like initially, before they are received among those who constitute 
the province of the seminal vesicles, for in these vesicles sperm (semen)<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is gathered together along with the suitable fluid with which the sperm is combined. That combination places the sperm 
in the right condition, so that once it has been sent forth it is released from the fluid at the cervix and thus serves to bring about conception. This kind of substance also holds within it the endeavour 
and so to speak desire to fulfill the same purpose and so to cast aside the fluid that clothes it. Something similar to this was seen to happen to that spirit. He returned to me, but now he was dressed 
in humble clothing. He said he had a burning desire to enter heaven and recognized that now he was in a fit state to remain there. I was led to say to him that this was perhaps a sign that he would 
be received there shortly. At this point angels told him to cast aside his clothing, which in his desire to do so he cast aside so quickly that hardly anything could have been done more quickly. 
This represented the nature of the desires of those in the province to which the seminal vesicles correspond.

</p><b>5056.</b>
Quidam spiritus ex alia tellure apud me fuit; de spiritibus ex aliis telluribus, alibi {1}, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur; is sollicite petiit ut intercederem pro eo ut venire posset in 
caelum; dicebat quod non sciat quod malum egerit, solum quod increpaverit incolas illius telluris, sunt enim {2} increpatores et castigatores eorum qui non rite vivunt, de quibus etiam quando de incolis 
aliarum tellurum, memorabitur; adjecit quod postquam increpavit, illos instruxerit; loquebatur tunc quasi bifide; is etiam potuit miserationem movere; sed non aliud (t)potui ei respondere quam 
quod nihil opis ferre possim, et quod id unice Domini sit, et si dignus quod posset sperare; sed tunc remissus est inter spiritus probos qui ex sua {3} tellure; at hi dicebant quod non posset    
 esse in eorum consortio, quia non talis; at quia usque ex intenso desiderio flagitabat ut intromitteretur in caelum, missus est in societatem proborum spirituum hujus telluris; verum etiam hi dicebant 
quod cum illis non esse posset; erat etiam nigri coloris in luce caeli, sed dixit ipse quod non esset {4} nigri sed murrhini coloris.  [2] Mihi dictum quod (t)tales sint principio qui dein recipiuntur 
inter illos qui constituunt provinciam `vesicularum seminalium'; in vesiculis enim illis colliguntur semen cum sero conveniente, cum quo combinatur, et per combinationem aptum redditur ut 
postquam emissum est, in cervice uteri resolvatur, et sic conceptioni inserviat, estque in tali substantia conatus et quasi desiderium praestandi usum, ita exuendi serum quo investitur; simile quid 
etiam apparuit apud illum spiritum; venit adhuc ad me, sed in vestitu vili, et dicebat quod arderet venire in caelum, et quod nunc apperciperet se talem esse; dicere ei dabatur quod forte id indicium 
sit quod brevi recipiatur; dicebatur tunc ei {5} ab angelis ut rejiciat vestem; is ex desiderio tam cito illam rejecit ut vix aliquid citius; per quod repraesentabatur qualia illorum desideria 
sunt qui in provincia cui vesiculae seminales correspondent. </p>
