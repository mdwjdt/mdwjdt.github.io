<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8810.</strong>出埃及记19:16-19.到了第三天早晨，有响声、闪电，在山上有浓云，并且号角的响声甚强大，营中的百姓尽都发颤。摩西率领百姓出营迎接神，他们都站在山脚下。西乃山全山冒烟，因为耶和华在火中降临山上，山的烟气上腾，如烧窑的烟一般，整座山大大地震动。号角的响声越来越大，摩西就说话，神以响声回答他。<br />“到了第三天”表洁净结束的时候。“早晨”表他们处于良善之时的一种状态。“有响声、闪电”表启示发生所在的一种神性状态。“在山上有浓云”表与那些即将接受的人有关的神性状态。“并且号角的响声甚强大”表周围的一种属天状态。“营中的百姓尽都发颤”表就那些即将接受之人而言的一种神圣震颤。“摩西率领百姓出营迎接神”表从神来的真理预备他们接受在他们所拥有的良善里面的神性的能力。“他们都站在山脚下”表远离属天之爱的良善。“西乃山全山冒烟”表属天良善处于最大模糊之中的表象。“因为耶和华在火中降临山上”表因为神性在那里处于属天之爱。“山的烟气上腾，如烧窑的烟一般”表像恶欲所产生的模糊那样的模糊。“整座山大大地震动”表天堂剧烈晃动。“号角的响声越来越大”表经由天使天堂而来的启示的总体方面。“摩西就说话，神以响声回答他”表通过拥有神性本身在它里面的从神来的真理之流注。</p>

Verses 16-19. And it was on the third day, when it was morning, that there were voices and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding strong, and all the people 
that were in the camp trembled. And Moses made the people go forth out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand in the lower parts of the mountain. And Mount Sinai smoked, the whole of 
it, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled mightily. And when the voice of the trumpet was going, and waxing 
strong mightily, Moses spake, and God answered him in a voice. "And it was on the third day," signifies at the end of the purification; "when it was morning," signifies a state when they were in good; 
"that there were voices and lightnings," signifies a Divine state in which was revelation; "and a heavy cloud upon the mountain," signifies a Divine state in respect to those who were about to receive; 
"and the voice of a trumpet exceeding strong," signifies a celestial state which was round about; "and all the people that were in the camp trembled," signifies a holy tremor on the part of those 
who were about to receive; "and Moses made the people go forth out of the camp to meet God," signifies the power of truth from the Divine to prepare them to receive the Divine in the good with them; 
"and they took their stand in the lower parts of the mountain," signifies far from the good of celestial love; "and Mount Sinai smoked, the whole of it," signifies the appearing of celestial good in 
the greatest obscurity; "because Jehovah descended upon it in fire," signifies because the Divine was there in celestial love; "and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace," signifies obscurity 
like the obscurity from cupidities; "and the whole mountain trembled mightily," signifies the commotion of heaven; "and when the voice of the trumpet was going, and waxing strong mightily," signifies 
what is general of revelation through the angelic heaven; "Moses spake, and God answered him in a voice," signifies by means of an influx of truth from the Divine wherein was the Divine Itself. </p>

Verses 16-19 And so it was on the third day, when it came to be morning, that there were voices<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and lightnings, and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the voice of a trumpet extremely loud; and all 
the people who were in the camp trembled. And Moses caused the people to go out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the foot<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the mountain. And Mount Sinai was smoking, the whole of it, because 
Jehovah came down onto it in fire; and its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain began to tremble greatly. And the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> Moses 
spoke and God answered him by a voice. </p>
<p>'And so it was on the third day' means at the end of purification. 'When it came to be morning' means a state when they were governed by good. 'That there were 
voices and lightnings' means a Divine state in which revelation took place. 'And a heavy cloud on the mountain' means the Divine state in relation to those about to receive. 'And the voice of a trumpet 
extremely loud' means a celestial state which was round about. 'And all the people who were in the camp trembled' means a holy quivering by those about to receive. 'And Moses caused the people to 
go out of the camp to meet God' means the power of the truth from God to make them ready to receive the Divine in the good they had. 'And they stood at the foot of the mountain' means a long way off 
from the good of celestial love. 'And Mount Sinai was smoking, the whole of it' means the appearance of celestial good in the greatest obscurity. 'Because Jehovah came down onto it in fire' means since 
the Divine was there in celestial love. 'And its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace' means obscurity like the obscurity resulting from evil desires. 'And the whole mountain began to tremble 
greatly' means heaven, shaking violently. 'And the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder' means revelation in its general aspects, which comes through the angelic heaven. 'Moses spoke, and God answered 
him by a voice' means through the influx of the truth from God, having the Divine Himself within it.

Vers. 16-19.  Et fuit in die tertio in fieri mane, et fuit voces et fulgura, et nubes gravis super monte, et vox buccinae vehemens valde, et trepidabat omnis populus qui in castris.  Et exire fecit 
Moscheh populum obviam Deo (x)e castris, et constiterunt in inferioribus montis.  Et mons Sinai fumabat totus ille, propter quod descendit super illum Jehovah in igne, et ascendit fumus ejus sicut fumus 
fornacis, et tremiscebat totus mons valde.  Et fuit vox buccinae vadens et fortificans se valde; Moscheh loquebatur et Deus respondebat illi in voce.  `Et fuit in die tertio' significat in fine purificationis: 
`in fieri mane' significat statum cum in bono: `et fuit voces et fulgura significat statum Divinum in quo revelatio: `et nubes gravis super monte significat statum Divinum respective ad illos 
qui recepturi: `et vox buccinae {1}vehemens valde' significat statum caelestem qui circum: `et trepidabat omnis populus qui in castris' significat sanctum tremorem illis qui recepturi: `et exire 
fecit Moscheh populum obviam Deo e castris' significat potentiam veri a Divino ad parandum illos ut recipiant Divinum in bono quod illis: `et constiterunt in inferioribus montis' significat longe a bono 
amoris caelestis: `et mons Sinai fumabat totus ille' significat apparitionem boni caelestis in maximo obscuro: `propter quod descendit super illum Jehovah in igne' significat quia Divinum ibi in amore 
caelesti: `et ascendit fumus ejus sicut fumus fornacis' significat obscurum sicut obscurum ex cupiditatibus: `et tremiscebat totus mons valde' significat caeli commotionem: `et fuit vox buccinae vadens 
et fortificans se valde' significat commune revelationis per caelum angelicum: `Moscheh loquebatur et Deus respondebat illi in voce' significat per influxum veri a Divino, in quo ipsum Divinum. @1
