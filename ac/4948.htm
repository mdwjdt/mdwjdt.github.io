<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4948节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4948.</strong>然而，那些活在肉身时只在自己里面思想和渴望涉及自我和世界的事物之人则向自己关闭了来自天堂的一切道路或一切流注；因为对自我和世界的爱与天堂之爱对立。他们当中那些同时沉溺于享乐或其它奢侈生活，并伴有内在诡诈的人，在右脚底之下，但在那里的深渊之处，因而在低级事物之地下面，这类灵人的地狱便在那里。他们的住所里只有污秽，他们还觉得自己似乎就带有污秽，因为污秽对应于他们所过的那种生活。那里的各种污秽照其生活的属和种而闻上去恶臭。许多曾举世闻名的人就住在那个地方。</p>

Those, however, who in the life of the body have from within thought and taken interest in nothing else than what relates to self and the world, have closed to themselves every way or every influx from 
heaven; because the love of self and the world is opposite to heavenly love. Those of them who have lived at the same time in pleasures, or in a luxurious life conjoined with interior cunning, are 
under the sole of the right foot, but at a great depth there, thus beneath the earth of lower things, where is the hell of such spirits. In their dwellings is nothing but filth; they also seem to themselves 
to carry filth, for it corresponds to such a life. The stench of different kinds of filth is smelled there according to the genera and species of their life. Many have their abode there who have 
been among the more celebrated in the world. </p>

Those however who during their lifetime thought about and desired within themselves nothing but that which was selfish and worldly shut off from themselves every path or influx from heaven; for self-love 
and love of the world are the opposite of heavenly love. Those of them who at the same time immersed themselves in pleasures or else luxurious living coupled with inner deceitfulness are beneath 
the sole of the right foot, but deep down and so below the land of lower things, where the hell, of such people is situated. Within their dwellings there is nothing but filth. They also seem to themselves 
to be carrying such, for filth corresponds to the kind of life they lead. One smells there the stench of different kinds of filth matching the genera and species of that kind of life. In that place 
live many who in the world were quite famous people. </p>

</p><b>4948.</b>
Qui aurem nihil aliud cogitarunt et studuerunt in vita corporis ex interiore suo, quam quae sunt sui et mundi, illi sibi praecluserunt omnem viam seu omnem influxum e caelo, nam amor sui et mundi 
est oppositus amori caelesti.  Illi eorum qui simul in voluptatibus aut in vita delicata conjuncta cum astu interiore vixerunt, sub planta pedis dextri {1} sunt, sed ibi profunde, ita sub terra inferiorum 
ubi talium infernum est, in domiciliis eorum nihil nisi quam sordes sunt; videntur etiam sibi portare talia, correspondent enim vitae tali; sentitur ibi fetor sordium diversarum secundum vitae 
genera et species: ibi degunt plures qui in mundo inter celebratiores fuerunt. @1 dextra$ </p>
