Verses 12-15. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to Me into the mountain, and be thou there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment, which I will write to teach 
them. And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister; and Moses went up unto the mountain of God. And he said unto the elders, Sit ye here for us, until we return unto you; and behold Aaron and Hur are with 
you; whosoever hath words, let him come near unto them. And Moses went up unto the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction from the Lord for 
those who are in the external sense; "Come up to Me into the mountain, and be thou there," signifies the presence of the Lord with them through an intermediate; "and I will give thee the tables of 
stone," signifies the book of the law, that is, the Word in the whole complex; "and the law and the commandment," signifies truth in general and in particular; "which I will write to teach them," signifies 
for remembrance and for instruction; "and Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister," signifies the Word and the representative; "and Moses went up unto the mountain of God," signifies toward heaven; 
"and he said unto the elders," signifies those who are in the external sense alone; "Sit ye here for us," signifies that they should remain in it; "until we return unto you," signifies until there 
is an answer; "and behold Aaron and Hur are with you," signifies the doctrine of truth from such a Word; "whosoever hath words, let him come near unto them," signifies that falsities are thereby to be 
removed; "and Moses went up unto the mountain," signifies to heaven; "and the cloud covered the mountain," signifies the external things of the Word. </p>

Verses 12-15 And Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to Me into the mountain, and be there; and I will give you tablets of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I shall write, to teach them. And Moses 
rose up, and Joshua his minister, and Moses went up into<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the mountain of God. And he said to the elders, Sit for us in this [place],<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with 
you; whoever has words,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> let him go to them. And Moses went up into<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instructions from the Lord for those restricted 
to the outward sense. 'Come up to Me into the mountain, and be there' means the Lord's presence with them through an intermediary. 'And I will give you tablets of stone' means the book of the law, 
or the Word in its entirety. 'And the law and the commandment' means truth in general and in particular. 'Which I shall write, to teach them' means for remembrance and for instruction. 'And Moses rose 
up, and Joshua his minister' means the Word and its representative. 'And Moses went up into the mountain of God' means in the direction of heaven. 'And he said to the elders' means those restricted 
to the outward sense alone. 'Sit for us in this [place]' means that they are to remain with this sense. 'Until we return to you' means till there is a reply. 'And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you' 
means teachings of truth that are derived from that outward sense of the Word. 'He who has words, let him go to them' means that by means of those teachings falsities are to be removed. 'And Moses went 
up into the mountain' means towards heaven. 'And a cloud covered the mountain' means the outward aspects of the Word.
