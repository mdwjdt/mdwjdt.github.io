<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8383节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8383.</strong>有一次，属于我们地球的一些恶灵被允许搞恶作剧，骚扰与我同在的木星灵。后者忍了他们很长时间，最后承认实在忍不下去了；他们觉得再没有比这些恶灵更坏的了。因为他们将木星灵的想象力，以及思维能力败坏到这种程度，以致木星灵觉得自己似乎他们似乎被囚，若没有神的帮助，就无法从中挣脱出来。<br />当我从圣言读到关于我们救主十字架受难的一些经文时，一些欧洲灵人就注入可怕的绊脚石，企图迷惑木星灵。于是便调查这些灵人是谁，在世时是干什么的；结果发现，其中一些灵人曾是传教士，和那些自称主的会士或耶稣会士的人没什么两样；他们在世时能通过传讲主的十字架受难而将普通百姓感动到流泪。木星被告知原因，即：他们在世上想一套，说一套；因此心里是一套，嘴上是另一套。不过，现在他们不被允许以这种虚假的方式说话；因为当他们成为灵人时，就被迫完全按照他们所想的说话。木星灵对一个人的内在与外在之间竟存在天壤之别，也就是说，一个人所想的竟然完全不同于他所想的而感到目瞪口呆，这对他们来说是不可能的。</p>

Once also it was permitted evil spirits of our earth to act by their evil arts, and to infest the spirits of Jupiter who were with me. The latter endured them for a considerable time, but finally confessed 
that they could do so no longer; and that they believed that there could not possibly be worse spirits, for they perverted their imagination and also their thought in such a manner that they seemed 
to themselves to be as it were bound, and not to be extricated from this except by Divine aid. While I was reading in the Word something concerning our Savior's Passion, certain European spirits 
injected direful objections, with intent to mislead the spirits of Jupiter. Inquiry was made who these spirits were, and what they had been in the world, and it was found that some of them had been preachers, 
not unlike those who call themselves of the Society of the Lord, or Jesuits, and that then by preaching about the Lord's Passion they could move the common people to tears. The cause was told 
them, namely, that in the world they thought in one way and spoke in another; thus that they entertained one opinion in their hearts, and expressed another with their mouth; but that now they are not 
allowed to speak in this fraudulent manner, for when they become spirits they are compelled to speak exactly as they think. The spirits of Jupiter were utterly astounded that there could be with man 
such variance of the interiors and exteriors, namely that he can speak in one way, and think in a wholly different way, which to them is impossible. </p>

On one occasion also evil spirits belonging to our planet were allowed to play their evil tricks and molest the spirits belonging to Jupiter who were present with me. The latter tolerated them for a 
very great length of time, but eventually they had to admit that they could do so no longer and that they thought there were none worse than those evil spirits. For they perverted the power of imagination 
of the spirits from Jupiter, and also their power of thought to such an extent that it seemed to them as though they were in bondage and could not be released from it without God's help. While I 
was reading something in the Word about our Saviour's passion certain spirits from Europe introduced dreadful stumbling blocks, with the intention of misleading the spirits from Jupiter. When questions 
were asked about who they were exactly and what they had been in the world it was learned that some of them had been preachers, not unlike those who call themselves members of the Society of Jesus<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
or Jesuits, and that when in the world they could move the common people to tears by their preaching about the Lord's passion. The spirits from Jupiter were told the reason for this, which was that in 
the world those preachers thought one way and spoke in another, and so held one thing in their heart and bore another on their lips. But now they are not allowed to speak in that false way; for when 
they become spirits they are compelled to speak altogether as they think. The spirits belonging to Jupiter were completely dumbfounded by the existence of such a dichotomy between a person's interiors 
and his exteriors, that is to say, by a person's saying things entirely different from his thinking, which for them was an impossibility.

Quondam etiam permittebatur spiritibus malis nostrae telluris agere per artes suas malas, et infestare spiritus Joviales qui apud me; hi illos admodum diu sustinebant, sed tandem fassi sunt quod non 
possent amplius, et quod crederent pejores non dari, nam pervertebant (c)illorum imaginationem, et quoque cogitationem ita ut sibi viderentur quasi ligati, et non nisi quam ope Divina inde extricandi. 
 Cum legerem in Verbo aliquid de passione Salvatoris nostri, tunc spiritus quidam Europaei inferebant dira scandala, animo seducendi spiritus Joviales; inquirebatur quinam essent et quid in mundo fuerant, 
et compertum quod quidam illorum fuerint (x)praedicatores, non dissimiles illis qui se ex societate Domini seu Jesuitas vocant, et quod tunc per praedicationes de passione Domini commovere potuerunt 
vulgus ad lacrimas; dicebatur illis causa quod in mundo {1}aliter cogitarent et aliter loquerentur, ita alia corde gererent et aliud ore ferrent, et quod nunc non ita fraudulenter illis liceat loqui, 
nam cum (t)fiunt spiritus, {2}adiguntur ad loquendum prorsus sicut cogitant.  Obstupuerunt spiritus Jovis maxime quod tale discidium interiorum et exteriorum apud hominem dari {3}posset, nempe prorsus 
aliter loqui et aliter cogitare, quod sibi impossibile esset. 	@1 tam mali fuerint corde, sed aliter loquuti ore, lucri et honoris aucupandi causa$ 	@2 adigantur$ 	@3 potuisset$ </p>
