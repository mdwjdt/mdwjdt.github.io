<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3404节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3404.</strong>“以撒在那地耕种”表从主而来、显现给理性的内层真理。这从“耕种”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“耕种”在至高意义上是指来自主的神圣真理，主就是那耕种者或播种者（<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>节），在内义上则表示人所具有的真理与良善，它们源于那神圣真理（<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；“地”是指被神性启示后成为真理表象的理性事物（<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节），或也可说，从主而来、显现给理性的内层真理。这些表象，或这些真理是属较高层级的，因为直到14节，在内义上所论述的主题就是它们。这些真理的表象就是天使所具有的那种，并且只要人活在世上，它们就无可限量地超出他的理解力。<br />为了更清楚地说明何为真理的表象，下面再举一例。众所周知，神性就存在而言是无限的，就显化而言是永恒的，有限不能理解无限，甚至也不能理解永恒，因为永恒是无限的显化。由于神性本身是无限和永恒的，故神性所发出的一切事物也是无限和永恒的。这些事物因是无限的，故绝不可能为天使所理解，因为他们也是有限的。正因如此，无限和永恒的事物在有限的表象内呈现给天使。不过。这类表象仍然远远超出人类的理解范畴。例如，若不通过时间或短暂之物，人绝不可能对永恒有任何概念。既然如此，他就绝不可能什么是来自永恒的，因而理解在时间存在或创世之前，神性是什么。只要他的思维含有一丝时间或短暂之物的概念，那么他在思想永恒之物时，就不可避免地陷入无法摆脱的错误中。但没有时间概念、只有状态概念的天使能充分理解它，因为对他们来说，永恒不是时间的永恒，而是状态的永恒，没有时间或短暂之物的概念。<br />由此可见，与世人相比，天使所具有的表象具有何种性质，并且他们的表象何等优于世人的。因为若脱离时空，世人就无法拥有一丁点思维；而天使的思维则根本没有这类源头。相反，他们的思维源于没有时间的状态，在状态中，事物的存在和显化是唯一考虑的事项。这些解释表明此处论述的真理表象是何性质，这些表象是属于较高层级的。按顺序，接下来的几节论述属于较低层级的真理表象，这些表象甚至适合人类。</p>

And Isaac sowed in that land. That this signifies interior truths which are from the Lord appearing to the rational, is evident from the signification of "sowing," as being in the supreme sense Divine 
truth which is from the Lord who is the sower (n. 3038); and in the internal sense the truth and good with man thence derived (n. 3373); and from the signification of "land," as being the rational things 
which when enlightened by the Divine are appearances of truth (n. 3368); or what is the same, interior truths which are from the Lord appearing to the rational; which appearances, or which truths, 
are of a higher degree, being treated of in the internal sense as far as verse 14. The angels are in these appearances of truth, which are such that they immeasurably transcend the understanding of 
man during his life in the world.  [2] In order that it may be still more evident what these appearances of truth are, take also the following example. It is known that the Divine is infinite as to 
being, and eternal as to manifestation, and that the finite is not capable of comprehending the infinite, nor indeed the eternal, for the eternal is the infinite as to manifestation; and as the Divine 
Itself is infinite and eternal, all things which are from the Divine are also infinite and eternal, and being infinite cannot possibly be comprehended by angels, because these are finite. For this reason 
the things which are infinite and eternal are presented before the angels in appearances which are finite; but still in such appearances as are very far above the sphere of man's comprehension. For 
example, man cannot possibly have any idea of the eternal except from time; and this being the case, he cannot possibly comprehend what is from eternity, thus what the Divine was before time, or before 
the world was created. And so long as there is in his thought anything of an idea from time, if he thinks on the subject he must necessarily fall into errors from which he cannot be extricated. But 
to the angels, who are not in the idea of time, but in the idea of state, it is given to perceive this most clearly, for the eternal with them is not the eternal of time, but the eternal of state, 
without the idea of time. [3] Hence it is manifest in what appearances the angels are in comparison with man, and how much their appearances are above those with man; for man cannot have the smallest 
thought apart from time and space; whereas the angels derive nothing from these; but in their stead from state as to being and as to manifestation. From all this we can see what is the nature of the 
appearances of truth here treated of, and which are of a higher degree. In what follows, the appearances of truth of a lower degree are treated of in their order, even as they are adapted to mankind. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3404</b></p><p><b>3404.</b>
'Isaac sowed in that land' means interior truths from the Lord as they appear to the rational. This is clear from the meaning of 'sowing' in the highest sense as Divine Truth from the Lord who is the 
Sower, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, and in the internal sense as the truth and good residing with a person, which stem from that Divine Truth, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>; and from the meaning of 'land' as rational concepts which, when enlightened 
from the Divine, are appearances of truth, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, or what amounts to the same, are interior truths from the Lord as they appear to the rational. These appearances or truths belong on a higher degree, 
for as far as verse 14 it is these that are the subject in the internal sense. These appearances of truth are the kind that exist with angels, and are such as go immeasurably above anyone's understanding 
as long as he lives in the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To make it clearer still what appearances of truth are, let the following example be added: It is well known that the Divine is infinite as regards Being 
(Esse) and eternal as regards Manifestation (Existere), and that what is finite is incapable of comprehending what is infinite, or indeed of comprehending what is eternal, since what is eternal is the 
Manifestation (Existere) of what is infinite. And because the Divine itself is infinite and eternal, so are all things which proceed from the Divine infinite and also eternal. And as those things are 
infinite angels are quite incapable of grasping them, for they too are finite beings. That being so, things that are infinite and eternal present themselves to angels within appearances that are finite, 
though within appearances such as are very far above the range of what man can comprehend. For example, man is quite incapable of possessing any idea of what is eternal except from what is temporal. 
And being incapable of having any idea other than this he is incapable of comprehending what 'from eternity' is and so what the Divine prior to the existence of time or creation of the world is. And 
as long as his thinking contains any idea at all that is formed from what is temporal, he slips inevitably, if he thinks about what is eternal, into errors from which he cannot be rescued. But the 
angels, whose ideas are not formed from anything temporal but from timeless state, are enabled to perceive it supremely well, for to them eternity is not eternity of time but eternity of state devoid 
of any idea of that which is temporal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this one may see what the appearances existing with angels are like compared with man's, and how superior their appearances are to man's. For man cannot 
have one shred of thought, not even the least shred, that is not in some way temporal and spatial in origin, whereas angels' thought has no such origin at all. Instead their thought has its origin 
in timeless state, in which the being (esse) and the manifestation (existere) of things is the only consideration. These few comments show the nature of the appearances of truth which are the subject 
in these verses, and that these appearances belong to a higher degree. The verses that follow deal in order with the appearances of truth that belong to a lower degree which are also suitable to the 
human race. </p>

`Seminavit Jishak in terra illa': quod significet vera interiora apparentia ad rationale quae a Domino, constat a significatione `seminare' quod sit in supremo sensu Divinum Verum quod a Domino Qui 
est seminans, n. 3038, in sensu interno est verum et bonum apud hominem, quod inde, n. 3373; et a significatione `terrae' quod sint rationalia quae, a Divino illustrata, sunt apparentiae veri, n. 3368, 
seu quod idem, vera interiora apparentia ad rationale quae a Domino; quae apparentiae seu quae vera sunt superioris gradus, nam usque ad vers. 14 de illis in sensu interno agitur; in illis veri  apparentiis 
sunt angeli, et sunt tales ut intellectum hominis quamdiu is vivit in mundo, immensum transcendant. [2] Ut adhuc constare possit quid apparentiae veri, sit quoque hoc exemplum: notum est quod 
Divinum sit infinitum quoad Esse, (c)ac aeternum quoad Existere, et quod finitum non capax sit comprehendere infinitum, immo nec aeternum, nam aeternum est infinitum quoad Existere, et quia Ipsum Divinum 
est infinitum et aeternum, etiam sunt omnia quae a Divino, infinita et quoque aeterna, et quia infinita, nequaquam possunt ab angelis capi quoniam ii finiti sunt; quapropter sistuntur illa quae infinita 
(c)et aeterna sunt coram illis in apparentiis quae sunt finitae, sed usque in talibus quae longissime supra sphaeram comprehensionis hominis sunt; ut pro exemplo, homo nusquam potest aliquam ideam 
aeterni habere nisi ex tempore, et quia id non potest, non comprehendere potest quid ab aeterno, ita quid Divinum ante tempus seu antequam mundus creatus est; et quamdiu cogitationi ejus inest aliquid 
ideae ex tempore, nusquam aliter potest quam, si cogitat de illo, {1}labi in errores, ex quibus extricari nequit; sed angelis, qui non in idea temporis sunt sed in idea status, quamoptime id datur 
percipere; nam aeternum non est illis aeternum temporis sed aeternum status, absque idea temporis; [3] inde patet in quibus apparentiis sunt angeli prae homine, {2}et quantum illorum apparentiae sunt 
supra apparentias quae homini; homo enim ne quidem unum cogitationis etiam minimum habere potest absque aliquo momento ex tempore et spatio, cum tamen angeli nihil inde, sed {3}pro illis ex statu quoad 
esse et quoad existere. Ex his paucis constare potest quales apparentiae veri {4}sunt, de quibus hic agitur, et quae sunt superioris gradus: in sequentibus agitur ordine de veri apparentiis inferioris 
gradus generi humano etiam adaequatis. @1 after nequit$  @2 seu $  @3 loco illorum$  @4 sint$  </p>
