<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4657节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4657.</strong>有些灵人有几次向我说话，但低声唧哝，与我的左耳贴得很近，仿佛他们想在我耳朵里说话，这样就没人听见了。但我蒙允许告诉他们说，这在来世是不可接受的，因为这表明他们在世时是窃窃私语的人，因而现在形成了这种窃窃私语的习惯；并且他们当中有许多人是那种注意别人的缺点和过错的人；要是没有其他人在听，他们就私下把这些缺点和过错告诉他们的同伴；要是有其他人在场，他们就附耳向同伴窃窃私语。他们看见并恶意解释一切错事，将自己置于其他人之上。因此，他们绝无可能被准许进入善灵的群体；因为善灵的性质是，他们不隐藏自己的想法。我听说，在来世，这样说话反而听上去比公开说话的声音还大。</p>

There are spirits who have sometimes spoken with me, but by muttering, and this quite near the left ear, as if they wished to speak in the ear so that no one would hear. But it was given me to tell them 
that this is not proper in the other life, because it shows them to be whisperers, and to have become imbued with the habit of whispering; and very many of them are of such a character as to observe 
the vices and faults of others, and tell them privately to their associates, or whisper them in the ear when others are present; and they see and interpret everything wrongly, and set themselves before 
others; and for this reason they can by no means be admitted into the company of good spirits, who are not such as to hide their thoughts. It was said that in the other life such speaking is heard 
louder than open speech. </p>

There are certain spirits who have spoken to me several times, but in undertones, doing so very close to my left ear, as though they wished to speak in my ear so that no one could hear. But I have been 
allowed to tell them that this is unacceptable in the next life, because it shows that they were whisperers during their lifetime and so have now acquired a disposition to engage in such whispering. 
It shows that many of them are the sort who note the vices and failings of others, and when no one else is listening tell their companions about those vices and failings, or if other people are within 
earshot whisper them in the ear. They see and put a sinister interpretation on everything, and set themselves above others. They cannot therefore by any means be allowed into the company of good spirits, 
whose nature is such that they do not conceal their thoughts. I have been told that in the next life this kind of speaking sounds louder than the open kind. </p>

Sunt spiritus qui aliquoties mecum locuti sunt, sed mussitando, et hoc propius ad aurem sinistram sic ut vellent loqui in aure ut nemo audiret; sed illis dicere datum quod hoc non conveniat in altera 
vita, quia manifestat quod {1} susurrones fuerint, {2}et inde natura etiam nunc susurrandi imbuti sint, et quod plures ex illis tales sint ut vitia et naevos aliorum observent, illa sociis nemine 
audiente dicant, vel iis praesentibus in aurem; quodque sinistre omnia videant et interpretentur, seque aliis praeferant; et quod ideo nullatenus admitti possint in consortium bonorum spirituum 
qui, tales sunt ut cogitata sua non abscondant.  Dictum quod usque talis loquela in altera ita sonantius audiatur quam loquela aperta.      @1 i in vita corporis$      @2 et natura ita susurrandi 
imbuti fuerint, et quod multi illorum tales sint,$ </p>
