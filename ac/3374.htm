<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3374节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3374.</strong>“我要将这些地都赐给”表属灵事物。这从“地”的含义清楚可知，“地”在此是指被神性启示后而成为真理表象的理性事物（参看<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节）。如前所述（<a href="3364.htm">3364</a>，<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>节），这些表象就是真理，因而是属灵的。事实上，它们无非是来自神性的真理，这从前面有关何谓属灵事物的多次说明可以看出来。从真正意义上说，“属灵”这个术语用来表示出自主的真理之光本身，就像“属天”这个术语用来表示出自主的良善的全部火焰一样。由此可见，由于这光从主流入人心智的理性部分和属世部分，故“属灵”这个术语适用于这二者，它就是所流入的真理方面的神性。由此可知何谓真正意义上的属灵，并且既存在一个属灵-理性，也存在一个属灵-属世。</p>

I will give all these lands. That this signifies spiritual things, is evident from the signification of "lands," as here being rational things, which when enlightened by the Divine are appearances of 
truth (see above, n. 3368). That these appearances are truths has already been shown (n. 3364, 3365); consequently by "lands" are here meant spiritual things, for these are nothing else than truths from 
the Divine, as may be seen from what has been frequently said above as to what is meant by spiritual things. By the spiritual in a genuine sense is meant the very light of truth which is from the 
Lord, just as by the celestial is meant all the flame of good from the Lord. From this we may see that as this light inflows from the Lord into both man's rational and his natural, the spiritual is predicated 
of both, and that it is the Divine as to the truth that flows in. This shows what in the genuine sense the spiritual is; and that there is a spiritual rational and a spiritual natural. </p>

'I will give all these lands' means spiritual things. This is clear from the meaning of 'lands' here as rational concepts which, when enlightened from the Divine, are appearances of truth, dealt with 
above in <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>. These appearances are truths, as has also been shown above in <a href="3364.htm">3364</a>, <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>, and are therefore spiritual. In fact they are nothing else than truths from the Divine, as becomes clear from 
what has been stated many times about the meaning of spiritual things In the genuine sense the term 'spiritual' is used to mean the light itself of truth which comes from the Lord, just as the term 'celestial' 
is used to mean the whole flame of good which comes from the Lord. From this it becomes clear that because that light flows in from the Lord both into the rational part and into the natural 
part of a person's mind, the term 'spiritual' is applicable to both, and that it is the Divine in respect to truth that flows in. From these considerations one may know what is meant in the genuine sense 
by spiritual, and that there is a spiritual-rational and there is a spiritual-natural. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3374</b>
</p><b>3374.</b>
`Dabo omnes terras has':  quod significet spiritualia, constat ex significatione `terrarum' quod hic sint rationalia quae a Divino illustrata sunt apparentiae veri, de qua supra n. 3368; quae apparentiae 
quod sint vera etiam supra n. 3364, 3365 ostensum est, proinde spiritualia, haec enim non aliud sunt quam vera a Divino, ut constare potest ex illis quae multoties de significatione spiritualium 
dicta sunt: per spirituale in genuino sensu intelligitur ipsa lux veri quae a Domino, sicut per caeleste omnis flamma boni a Domino; inde constare potest quod quia lux illa influit a Domino tam in rationale 
quam in naturale hominis, spirituale praedicetur de utroque, et quod sit Divinum quoad verum quod influit. Ex 
his sciri potest quid per spirituale in genuino sensu significatur, et quod sit spirituale 
rationale et spirituale naturale. </p>
