Verses 17-21. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying, And thou shalt make a laver of brass, and its base of brass, for washing; and thou shalt put it between the Tent of meeting and the altar, and thou 
shalt put waters therein. And Aaron and his sons shall wash from it their hands and their feet. When they enter into the Tent of meeting they shall wash with waters, that they die not; or when they come 
near unto the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering to Jehovah. And they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not; and it shall be to them a statute of an age, to him and to his 
seed, to their generations. "And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying," signifies perceptivity from enlightenment through the Word by the Lord; "and thou shalt make a laver of brass," signifies the good 
of the natural man, in which is purification; "and its base of brass," signifies the good of the ultimate of the natural, which is of the sensuous; "for washing" signifies purification from evils and 
falsities; "and thou shalt put it between the Tent of meeting and the altar," signifies that there may be the conjunction of truth and good; "and thou shalt put waters therein," signifies the truths 
of faith, through which there is purification in the natural; "and Aaron and his sons shall wash from it," signifies a representative of the purification and regeneration of man by the Lord; "their hands 
and their feet," signifies the interiors and exteriors of man; "when they enter into the Tent of meeting," signifies worship from the good of faith; "they shall wash with waters," signifies purification 
by means of the truths of faith; "that they die not," signifies lest the representative perish; "or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering to Jehovah," signifies 
worship from the good of love; "and they shall wash their hands and their feet," signifies the purification of the interiors and the exteriors of man; "that they die not," signifies lest the representative 
perish; "and it shall be to them a statute of an age," signifies an eternal law of order; "to him and to his seed, to their generations," signifies all who receive the things that proceed from 
the Lord, thus who are being regenerated by Him. </p>

Verses 17-21  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, And you shall make a laver of bronze, and its pedestal from bronze, for washing; and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and 
put water in it. And Aaron and his sons shall wash in it<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> their hands and their feet. When they go into the tent of meeting they shall wash with water, that they may not die, or when they approach the

<p>'And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying' means perception as a result of enlightenment from the Lord through the Word. 'And you shall make a laver of bronze' means the good 
within the natural degree in a person, in which purification takes place. 'And its pedestal from bronze' means good on the last level of the natural, which is that of the senses. 'For washing' means 
purification from evils and falsities. 'And you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar' means in order that truth and good may be joined together. 'And put water in it' means the truths 
of faith by means of which purification in the natural is accomplished. 'And Aaron and his sons shall wash in it' means a representative sign of the purification and regeneration of a person by the 
Lord. 'Their hands and their feet' means the person's interiors and exteriors. 'When they go into the tent of meeting' means worship springing from the good of faith. 'They shall wash with water' means 
purification effected by means of the truths of faith. 'That they may not die' means so that what is representative may not be lost. 'Or when they approach the altar to minister, to burn a fire offering 
to Jehovah' means worship springing from the good of love. 'And they shall wash their hands and their feet' means purification of the person's interiors and exteriors. 'That they may not die' means 
so that what is representative may not be lost. 'And it shall be the statute of an age to them' means an eternal law of order. 'For him and his seed [throughout] their generations' means all who receive 
the things which emanate from the Lord, thus who are being regenerated by Him.
