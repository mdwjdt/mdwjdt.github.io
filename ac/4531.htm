<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4531节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4531.</strong>由于正是源于主的聪明和智慧在天上显为光，天使由此被称为光明天使，所以正是源于自我的愚昧和疯狂在地狱掌权，使那里的居民因黑暗而得其名。事实上，地狱并没有黑暗，而是有一种如同煤火所发出的幽暗之光，他们便在这光中看到彼此。若没有这光，他们就无法存活。他们的光源于天上的光，当这光进入他们的狂躁，也就是进入他们的虚假和恶欲时，就被转化为那种幽暗之光。主处处都与光同在，甚至在地狱里也是；否则，地狱居民将没有任何思考并由此说话的能力；但光取决于对它的接受。地狱的幽暗之光在圣言中被称为“死荫”，并被比作“幽暗”。对那里的居民来说，当他们接近天上的光时，这幽暗之光也会变为黑暗；当他们陷入黑暗时，愚昧和蠢笨就掌权作王。由此可见，光对应于真理，暗对应于虚假；那些陷入虚假的人可以说就处于“瞎眼”的状态。</p>

As it is intelligence and wisdom from the Lord which appear in heaven as light, the angels being therefore called angels of light, so it is the folly and insanity which are from self that reign in hell, 
causing those who are there to have their name from darkness. It is true that in hell there is not darkness, but a dusky luminosity like that from a coal fire, in which they see one another, and without 
which they would not be able to live. This luminosity comes to them from the light of heaven, which is turned into such a luminosity when it falls into their insanities, that is, into their falsities 
and cupidities. The Lord is everywhere present with light, even in the hells, otherwise the infernals would have no capacity to think and thereby to speak, but the light is according to the reception. 
This luminosity is what is called in the Word the "shadow of death," and is compared to "darkness," and is also turned into darkness with them when they approach the light of heaven; and when 
they are in darkness, they are in folly and stupidity. Hence it is evident that as light corresponds to truth, so darkness corresponds to falsity, and that they who are in falsities are said to be in 
"blindness." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4531</b></p><p><b>4531.</b>
As it is intelligence and wisdom from the Lord which appear in heaven as light, and the angels are consequently called angels of light, so it is the folly and insanity deriving from the proprium which 
reign in hell, and those who are there are consequently referred to as those belonging to the darkness. Actually there is no darkness in hell but a dim light like that emitted from a coal fire, in which 
light they see one another. Without this they would not be able to live. This light of theirs originates in the light of heaven which is converted into that dull light when it enters into their manias, 
that is, into their falsities and evil desires. The Lord is present with light everywhere, even in the hells, otherwise they would not have any ability to think and consequently to speak; but the 
light is conditioned by the reception of it. The dim light of hell is that which in the Word is called the shadow of death and is compared to the darkness. With those there it is also converted into 
darkness when they go near the light of heaven; and when they are in darkness foolishness and stupidity reign. From this one may see that as light corresponds to truth, so darkness corresponds to falsity; 
and that those governed by falsities are said to be in a state of blindness. </p>

</p><b>4531.</b>
Quia intelligentia et sapientia a Domino est quae sicut lux apparet in caelo, (o)inde angeli vocantur angeli lucis, ita insipientia et insania quae a proprio, est quae regnat [in] inferno, inde {1} 
qui ibi, dicuntur a tenebris; in inferno {2} (t)quidem non sunt tenebrae sed est ibi lumen obscurum, sicut id quod (o)est ex igne carbonario, in quo se mutuo vident; alioquin non vivere potuissent: 
oritur illis hoc lumen ex luce caeli, quae cum incidit in vesanias eorum, hoc est, in falsitates et cupiditates, vertitur in tale: Dominus cum luce ubivis praesens est, etiam in infernis, alioquin 
non illis foret aliqua facultas cogitandi et inde loquendi; sed fit lux secundum receptionem.  Hoc lumen est quod in Verbo vocatur umbra mortis, et comparatur tenebris; vertitur etiam illis in 
tenebras cum approximant ad lucem caeli, et cum in tenebris sunt, in fatuitate et stupiditate sunt.  Inde constare potest quod sicut lux correspondet vero, ita tenebrae correspondeant falso; et quod 
qui in falsis sunt, dicantur in caecitate esse.      @1 i et$      @2 infernis$ </p>
