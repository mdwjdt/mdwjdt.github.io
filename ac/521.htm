<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>521.</strong>“神将他取去，他就不在世了”表教义被保存，以备后世所用。关于以诺，如前所述，上古教会所直觉到的东西，被他转变成教义，那时的教会是不允许这种事的。因为通过直觉知道的东西完全不同于通过教义学到的东西。拥有直觉的人没必要通过制定教义的途径学习他们早已知道的东西。举例说明，某人已经知道怎样清晰地思维了，就没必要学习如何思考的规则。倘若他这么做，其清晰思维的能力就会丧失，正如发生在那些被掩埋于纯粹的唯理智论灰尘中的人那样。对于通过直觉获取知识者，主许他们通过内在渠道认识何为善与真，而对于通过教义学习者，则许他们通过外在渠道，也就是身体感官认识善与真。二者之别犹如光暗之别。而且，属天之人的直觉决非笔墨所能形容，因为他们能进入至微细节处，并根据状态和伴随的环境随机应变。由于已经预见上古教会的直觉会丧失，随后人们将通过教义学习何为真与善，也就是说，他们将藉着暗来就光，所以这里说“神将他取去”，也就是说，神保存这教义，以备后世所用。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]521.</strong> He was no more, because God took him, means that this doctrine was preserved for use by future generations. The case with Enoch was that, as stated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_521/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519" target=_top>519:1</a>], he took what the earliest church perceived and reduced it to a doctrinal system — a forbidden thing at that time.{*1} Recognizing from perception, after all, is completely different than learning from doctrine.<br />People who have the gift of perception have no need to learn by way of doctrinal formulas what they already know. To illustrate: when we already know how to think effectively, we do not need an artificial system to teach us how. Using such a system would destroy our ability to think effectively, as it does for those who wallow in scholarly dust.{*2} People who recognize what is good and true on the basis of perception receive that intuition from the Lord by an internal route. Those who recognize it on the basis of doctrine receive their knowledge by an external route — the physical senses. The difference is like that between light and darkness.<br />Furthermore, the perceptions of a heavenly type of person can never be described, because they involve the tiniest, most specific details and take into account all the variety of different conditions and circumstances.<br />It was foreseen, however, that the perceptiveness of the earliest church would come to an end, and that people thereafter would learn from doctrine how to identify truth and goodness; in other words, they would travel through the dark to arrive at light. In consequence, it says here that "God took him," which is to say that God preserved perception for the use of future generations.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg here differs from much of Jewish and Christian tradition, which portrays Enoch as a figure of extraordinary sanctity who attained the heights of mystical experience. The pseudoepigraphical Book of Enoch, for example, which dates to the first and second centuries b.c.e., describes him as "a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, [and who] saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens" (Enoch 1.2, in Charles 1913, 188). [RS]<br />{*2} The Latin phrase here translated "scholarly dust" is pulvis scholasticus. This was a common phrase; among other things, it was the title of at least two books published in Germany as early as the 1590s (Götting 1592 and Waldung 1595), and had a long life in its German form, Schulstaub. It referred literally to the acrid dust that collects on the upper edges of books, but functioned as a derogatory reference to the petty subjects of study pursued by fanatical scholars. Swedenborg uses similar phrases in Dynamics of the Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955), part 2, 207; and The Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1744-1745] 1960) 9 (though the latter instance is obscured in translation).

As to the words "he was no more, for God took him" signifying the preservation of that doctrine for the use of posterity, the case with Enoch, as already said, is that he reduced to doctrine what in 
the Most Ancient Church had been a matter of perception, and which in the time of that church was not allowable; for to know by perception is a very different thing from learning by doctrine. They who 
are in perception have no need to learn by formulated doctrine that which they know already. For example: he who knows how to think well, has no occasion to be taught to think by any rules of art, for 
in this way his faculty of thinking well would be impaired, as is the case with those who stick fast in scholastic dust. To those who learn by perception, the Lord grants to know what is good and true 
by an inward way; but to those who learn from doctrine, knowledge is given by an external way, or that of the bodily senses; and the difference is like that between light and darkness. Consider also 
that the perceptions of the celestial man are such as to admit of no description, for they enter into the most minute and particular things, with all variety according to states and circumstances. But 
as it was foreseen that the perceptive faculty of the most Ancient Church would perish, and that afterwards mankind would learn by doctrines what is true and good, or by darkness would come to light, 
it is here said that "God took him" that is, preserved the doctrine for the use of posterity. </p>

'He was no more for God took him' means that that doctrine reserved for use by descendants. He was no more. As regards Enoch, that which the Most Ancient Church had perceived, as has been stated, was 
converted by him into doctrine, something that had not been allowed to people of that period. For knowing something from perception is altogether different from learning it from doctrine. People who 
have perception have no need to learn through the channel of formulated doctrine what they know already. Take, for the sake of illustration, someone who knows already how to think clearly. He has no need 
to learn rules on how to think. If he did so his ability to think clearly would perish, as happens to people buried in the dust of sheer intellectualism. In the case of people whose knowledge comes 
from perception, the Lord grants them to know what good and truth are through an internal channel, while those who learn from doctrine are granted it by an external channel, that is, by way of the physical 
senses. The difference between the two is like that between light and darkness. Furthermore the perceptions of the celestial man lie beyond all description, for they enter into the smallest details 
and are for ever varied according to states and attendant circumstances. Now as it was foreseen that the perceptivity of the Most Ancient Church would perish, and that subsequently people would 
learn what truth and good were by means of doctrines, that is, they would come to the light by way of darkness, it is therefore said here that 'God took him', which is to say, He preserved such doctrine 
for the use of descendants.  </p>

</p><b>521.</b>
Quod 'non amplius, quia sumpsit illum Deus' significet quod doctrina ista conservata sit in usum posteritatis; ita se res habet cum Hanocho, quod perceptivum Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, ut dictum, redegerit 
in doctrinam; quod illo tempore non luit permissum; nam prorsus aliud est ex perceptione nosse quam ex doctrina discere; qui in perceptione sunt, non opus habent per viam doctrinae formatae nosse 
quod norunt; sicut illustrationis causa, qui novit bene cogitare, non opus habet discere cogitare ab artificiali; inde periret ejus facultas bene cogitandi, sicut apud eos qui in pulvere scholastico 
haerent. Qui ex perceptione, illis per viam internam datur a Domino nosse quid bonam et verum; at qui ex doctrina, iis per viam externam seu sensuum corporis; quae differentia est sicut inter lucem et 
tenebras; accedit, quod perceptiones hominis caelestis nusquam possint describi, nam in minutissimis et singularissimis sunt cum omni varietate secundum status et circumstantias. Sed quia praevisum 
est quod perceptivum Antiquissimae Ecclesiae periret, et quod postea per doctrinas discerent quid verum et bonum, seu per tenebras venirent ad lucem, ideo dicitur hic quod 'sumpserit eum Deus' hoc est, 
quod conservaverit in usum posteritatis. </p>
