<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第654节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>654.</strong>这与当今基督教会中人所共知的事是一致的：信通过聆听而来。但信绝不是对构成信的事物，即当相信之事的认知，这等同于知识。信是承认，然而承认绝不可能存在于任何人身上，除非信的原则，也就是仁爱，即对邻人的爱和怜悯在他里面。当仁爱存在时，承认和信才会存在。人若不这样去理解，那他距离对信的认知，遥远得如同地与天的距离。当仁爱，即构成信的良善存在时，承认，即构成信的真理也会存在。因此，当一个人照着知识、理性和觉性重生时，最终目的就是为了使土地，即他的心智能预备好接受仁爱。此后他能通过仁爱，确切地说通过仁爱的生活而思考和行动。就在这时，而不是之前，他被改造或重生了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]654.</strong> The above process, then, as churches today know, is to gain faith through hearing.{*1} But faith is decidedly not a knowledge of faith's tenets, a knowledge of what should be believed; such knowledge is mere book learning. Faith is acknowledgment. What is more, acknowledgment is impossible to anyone who lacks the most important element of faith, which is charity — that is, love for others and mercy. Where charity exists, acknowledgment exists, which is to say, faith exists. Anyone who imagines otherwise is as far from understanding what faith is as the earth is from heaven. When charity (the goodness belonging to faith) is present, acknowledgment (the truth belonging to faith) is present.<br />Consequently, the purpose of our rebirth through matters of fact, reason, and understanding is to prepare the soil of our minds to receive charity. Charity — or rather the living out of charity — then forms the basis of thought and action. At that point we are reformed or reborn, and not before.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is probably alluding here to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/bible_king-james-version_romans_10_17" target=_top>Romans 10:17</a>. In Swedenborg's works, this type of locution ("as churches today know") often, though not invariably, seems to be an indirect reference to the Epistles of Paul. See, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 1563:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4286" target=_top>4286:1</a> (references to such passages as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_4_16" target=_top>2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/bible_king-james-version_romans_2_28-29" target=_top>Romans 2:28-29</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 1659:2</a> (a reference to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/bible_king-james-version_hebrews_5_9-10" target=_top>Hebrews 5:9-10</a>, among others); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_426" target=_top>Marriage Love 426</a> (a reference to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/bible_king-james-version_romans_7_22-23" target=_top>Romans 7:22-23</a>). Contrast, however, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_104" target=_top>True Christianity 104</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654/swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_150" target=_top>Divine Providence 150:1</a>, which use a similar locution but quote books other than the Epistles in support of their points.

This agrees with what is at this day known in the churches: that faith comes by hearing. But faith is by no means the knowledge [cognitio] of the things that are of faith, or that are to be believed. 
This is only memory-knowledge [scientia]; whereas faith is acknowledgment. There can however be no acknowledgment with anyone unless the principal of faith is in him, which is charity, that is, love 
toward the neighbor and mercy. When there is charity, then there is acknowledgment, or faith. He who apprehends otherwise is as far away from a knowledge of faith as earth is from heaven. When charity 
is present, which is the goodness of faith, then acknowledgment is present, which is the truth of faith. When therefore a man is being regenerated according to the things of knowledge, of reason, and 
of understanding, it is to the end that the ground may be prepared-that is, his mind-for receiving charity; from which, or from the life of which, he thereafter thinks and acts. Then he is reformed or 
regenerated, and not before. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 654</b></p><p><b>654.</b>
This is in keeping with what is well known in the Churches today about faith coming through hearing. But faith is in no sense mere intellectual awareness of the things that constitute faith, that is, 
of things that demand belief. That amounts to no more than knowledge. Faith is acknowledgement, yet acknowledgement cannot possibly exist with anyone unless the chief thing of faith resides with him, 
namely charity, or love towards the neighbour, and mercy. When charity is present so is acknowledgement, and so is faith. Anyone who thinks otherwise is as far from being aware of what faith is as land 
is distant from sky When charity, which is the goodness constituting faith, is present, then acknowledgement, which is the truth of faith, is present too. When therefore a person is being regenerated 
in accordance with factual knowledge, rational concepts, and intellectual concepts, the end in view is that the around, which is his mind, shall be made ready for receiving charity, from which, or 
rather from the life of which, he afterwards thinks and acts. At that point he has been reformed or regenerated, not before. </p>

</p><b>654.</b>
Hoc nunc est quod notum est in Ecclesiis hodie, quod fides per auditionem; sed fides nusquam est cognitio illorum quae sunt fidei, seu cognitio credendorum; hoc solum est scientia; sed est agnitio; 
sed agnitio nusquam apud aliquem dari potest nisi principale fidei apud illum sit, quod est charitas, hoc est, amor erga proximum, et misericordia; quando charitas est, tunc est agnitio, aut tunc est 
fides; qui aliter capit, tam longe abest a cognitione fidei, quantum abest vel distat terra a caelo: cum charitas adest quae est bonitas fidei, tunc adest agnitio quae est veritas fidei: quare homo dum 
secundum scientifica, rationalia et intellectualia regeneratur, est ob finem ut praeparetur humus, seu mens ejus, ad recipiendum charitatem, ex qua seu ex cujus vita dein cogitet et agat; tunc reformatus 
seu regeneratus est, non prius. </p>
