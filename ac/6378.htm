<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6378节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6378.</strong>“在血红葡萄汁中洗了袍褂”表祂的领悟力在于来自其神性之爱的神性良善。这从“血红葡萄汁”和“袍褂”的含义清楚可知：“血红葡萄汁”是指爱之良善，在至高意义上是指从主的神性之爱所流出的神性良善，如下文所述；“袍褂”（covering或garment）是指领悟力，因为领悟力是接受者，接受者是一个容器，故像袍褂。之所以“袍褂”表示领悟力，“衣服”表示属世层（如刚才所述<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>节），是因为那里论述的主题是外在之物，而此处论述的主题是内在之物。在圣言中，由于天上的婚姻，当经上论述外在之物时，也会论述内在之物；论述真理的地方，也论述良善（参看<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>节）。有时，这看似同一件事的一种重复，如此处经上说：“他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在血红葡萄汁中洗了袍褂”。“酒”和“血红葡萄汁”似乎描述了同一件事，“衣服”和“袍褂”也是；但它们并不一样，因为以这种方式所表达的是外在之物和内在之物。<br />“血红葡萄汁”表示来自主的神性之爱的神性良善，这从“血”的含义明显可知，“血”是指来自主的神性良善的神性真理（<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>节）；“葡萄”在至高意义上表示存在于那些在主的属灵国度之人当中的神性良善，因而在相对意义上表示仁之良善（<a href="5117.htm">5117</a>节）。在摩西之歌中，“血红葡萄汁”具有同样的含义：<br />牛群的奶油、羊群的奶、羊羔的脂油、巴珊所出的公绵羊、山羊，与肥美上好的麦子，也喝未掺杂的血红葡萄汁。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.14.htm">32:14</a>）</p>

And his covering in the blood of grapes. That this signifies that His intellectual is Divine good from His Divine love, is evident from the signification of the "blood of grapes," as being the good of 
love, and in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine good from His Divine love (of which in what follows); and from the signification of a "covering," as being the intellectual, for the intellectual is 
a recipient, and that which receives, being a vessel, is like a covering. That by a "covering" is signified the intellectual, and by "clothing" the natural (of which just above, n. 6377), is because there 
the subject treated of is what is external, but here what is internal; for in the Word, on account of the heavenly marriage, where it treats of what is external it treats also of what is internal; 
and where it treats of truth it treats also of good (see n. 6343). This sometimes appears like a repetition of the same thing, as here: "He washes his clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood 
of grapes," where "wine" and the "blood of grapes" appear to be the same, and also "clothing" and "covering;" but they are not the same, because what is external and what is internal are thus expressed. [2] 
That the "blood of grapes" denotes the Divine good from the Divine love of the Lord, is plain from the signification of "blood," as being the Divine truth from the Divine good of the Lord (n. 
4735); and by "grapes" in the supreme sense is signified the Lord's Divine good which those have who are in His spiritual kingdom; and hence by "grapes" in the relative sense is signified the good of 
charity (n. 5117). By the "blood of the grape" the like is also signified in the song of Moses: </p>
<p>     Butter of the herd and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs and of rams the sons of Bashan, and of 
he-goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou shalt drink the blood of the grape unmixed (Deut. 32:14). </p>

'And his garment in the blood of grapes' means that His Intellect consists in Divine Good from His Divine Love. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blood of grapes' as the good of love, and in the 
highest sense the Lord's Divine Good flowing from His Divine Love, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'garment' as the intellect, for the intellect is a receiver, and what is a receiver, being 
a container, is like a garment. The reason why 'garment' means the intellect and why 'clothing', dealt with immediately above in <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>, means the natural is that the external was the subject there, whereas 
the internal is the subject here. For owing to the heavenly marriage in the Word, when the external is referred to, so also is the internal; and when truth is referred to, so also is good, see <a href="6343.htm">6343</a>. 
This sometimes seems to outward appearance to amount to a repetition of the same thing, as for example here where it says 'He washes his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes .'Wine' 
and 'the blood of grapes' seem to describe the same thing, and so do 'clothing' and 'garment'; but they do not because what is external and what is internal are expressed in that way. </p>

 The 
fact that 'the blood of grapes' is Divine Good from the Lord's Divine Love is evident from the meaning of 'blood' as Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Good, referred to in <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>; and by 
'grapes' in the highest sense is meant the Lord's Divine Good present with those in His spiritual kingdom, and consequently in the relative sense the good of charity, <a href="5117.htm">5117</a>. 'The blood of the grape' also 
has a similar meaning in the Song of Moses, </p>

`Et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum':  quod significet quod Intellectuale Ipsius sit Divinum Bonum ex Divino Amore Ipsius, constat ex significatione `sanguinis uvarum' quod sit bonum amoris, et in supremo 
sensu Divinum Bonum Domini ex Divino Amore Ipsius, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `velaminis' quod sit intellectuale; est enim intellectuale recipiens, et quod recipit, quia est vas, est 
instar velaminis; quod per `velamen' significetur intellectuale, et per `vestimentum' {1}naturale, de quo mox supra n. 6377, est quia agitur ibi de externo, hic autem de interno; nam in Verbo propter 
conjugium (x)caeleste ubi agitur de externo, etiam agitur de interno, et ubi de vero, ibi etiam de bono, videatur n. 6343; hoc apparet quandoque sicut repetitio ejusdem rei, sicut hic `Lavat in vino 
vestimentum suum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum' ubi `vinum' et `sanguis uvarum' apparent {2} similia esse, tum `vestimentum' et `velamen'; sed non sunt similia, quia externum et internum ita exprimuntur. 
 [2]Quod `sanguis uvarum' sit Divinum Bonum ex Divino Amore Domini, patet a significatione `sanguinis' quod sit Divinum Verum a Divino Bono Domini, de quo n. 4735, et per `uvas' in supremo sensu 
significatur Divinum Bonum Domini quod illis qui in regno spirituali Ipsius, et inde per `uvas' in sensu respectivo significatur bonum charitatis, n. 5117:  {3}per `sanguinem {4}uvae' simile etiam 
significatur in Cantico apud Mosen, 	Butyrum armenti, et lac gregis, cum adipe agnorum, et  arietum filiorum Bashanis, et hircorum cum adipe renum tritici, et sanguinem uvae bibis, merum, Deut. (x)xxxii
