<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第954节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>954.</strong>在世时所沉迷的幻想在来生会转化为其它相对应的幻觉。例如，对那些在世时就残暴无情的人而言，其残暴和无情会转化为难以置信的残忍。他们觉得自己似乎能杀死所遇到的任何伙伴，以各种方式折磨之，并乐在其中，以致这类剥削构成他们最大的快乐。那些嗜血成性的人则以折磨其他精灵，甚至让他们流血为乐，因为他们以为精灵是人，不知道别的。一看到血（其幻觉使他们仿佛看见真的血），他们就欣喜若狂。贪婪会照其种类产生似乎被老鼠等骚扰的幻象。那些在纯世俗的乐趣中寻求满足，并视之为终极目的、最大良善、仿佛天堂之人，以在公共厕所闲逛为最大乐趣，他们觉得这里才是最令人愉快的地方；有的以恶臭的尿池为乐；有的则以淤泥地为乐，诸如此类。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]954.</strong> In the next life, the fantasies that people have had during physical life alter, although the new fantasies still correspond to the old ones. Some people, for instance, were ruthless and violent on earth. Their violence and lack of mercy turns into unbelievable cruelty, and whenever they happen upon an acquaintance, they seem to themselves to kill the person. They also torture the person in various ways that bring them great satisfaction — so great that these are their supreme pleasures.<br />People who had been bloodthirsty take delight in abusing spirits to the point of drawing blood; they suppose that the spirits are mortal, not knowing any better. When they see blood (such is their fantasy that they seem to see blood), they are in ecstasy.<br />Greed spurs a proliferation of fantasies in which spirits seem to be overrun by rats and other vermin, depending on the variety of greed.<br />Those who enjoyed pleasures that were purely sensual and who regarded these as the ultimate goal, the highest good, and their "heaven," linger with utmost delight in latrines, sensing intense pleasure there. Some spend their time in puddles of foul-smelling urine, some in muck, and so on. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 954</b></p><p><b>954.</b>
The phantasies which have been indulged in the life of the body are turned in the next life into others, which, however, correspond to the first. For example, with those who have been violent and merciless 
on earth, their violence and unmercifulness are turned into incredible cruelty; and they seem to themselves to kill whatever companions they meet, and to torture them in various ways, wherein they 
take what is to them the greatest possible delight. Those who have been bloodthirsty take delight in torturing other spirits, even to bloodshed, for they suppose spirits to be men, not knowing otherwise. 
At the sight of blood-for such is their phantasy that they as it were see blood-they are greatly delighted. From avarice there break forth phantasies as if they were infested with mice, and the 
like, according to the species of avarice. Those who have been delighted with mere pleasures, having these as their ultimate end, as their highest good, and as it were their heaven, find their highest 
delight in staying in privies, perceiving there what is most enjoyable. Some take delight in urinous and noisome pools, some in miry places, and so on. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 954</b></p><p><b>954.</b>
The delusions that have been present during a person's lifetime are converted in the next life into different though corresponding delusions. For example, people who on earth have been violent and pitiless 
have their violence and lack of pity converted into unbelievable cruelty; and to themselves they seem to strike down any fellow spirits they meet and to torment them in various ways, in which they 
take so much pleasure that such exploits constitute their greatest delights. Those who have been bloodthirsty take delight in tormenting other spirits even to the point of spilling their blood; for 
not knowing otherwise, they imagine that spirits are men. At the sight of blood - such being their delusion that they actually see what looks like blood - they are extremely delighted. Avarice gives 
rise to delusions of seeming to be infested by mice and the like, depending on the form which avarice takes. Those who have found satisfaction in mere earthly pleasures, regarding these as their final 
aim, highest good, and so to speak their heaven, find it their highest delight to loiter in public latrines, where they find it most enjoyable. Some delight in urinous and stinking pools, others in 
mucky places, and so on. </p>

</p><b>954.</b>
Phantasiae quae fuerunt in vita corporis, in altera vita vertantur in alias, quae tamen illis correspondent; sicut qui in terra violenti fuerant et immisericordes, eorum violentia et immisericordia 
vertitur in crudelitatem incredibilem, et videntur sibi socios quoscumque offendunt, occidere et diversis modis cruciare, quibus tantopere delectantur ut sint talia eorum summae jucunditates.  Qui sanguinolenti 
fuerunt, ii delectantur cruciare spiritus, nam putant spiritus esse homines, non aliter sciunt, usque ad sanguinem, quo viso, nam talis est phantasia eorum ut quasi sanguinem videant, maximopere 
delectantur.  Ex avaritia erumpunt phantasiae, quod videantur infestari a muribus et similibus secundum speciem avaritiae.  Qui delectati sunt meris voluptatibus quas pro ultimo fine, summo bono 
et quasi suo caelo habuerunt, delectantur maxime morari in latrinis, ibi jucundissimum percipientes; quidam in urinosis et graveolentibus stagnis, quidam in luteis, et sic porro. </p>
