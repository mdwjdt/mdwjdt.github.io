<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第382节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>382.</strong>“你必游离漂荡在地上”表不知何为善与真，这一点从“游离”和“漂荡”的含义明显可知。如：“先知与祭司在街上如瞎子乱走，又被血玷污，以致人不能摸他们的衣服。”（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.13.htm">4:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.14.htm">14</a>）“先知”指那些教导者，“祭司”指那些照此生活者；“在街上乱走”表不知何为真与善。<br />“我在一块田地降雨，另一块田地没有雨水就枯干了。这样，两三城的人游走到一个城去找水喝，却没有足够的水喝。”（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.7.htm">4:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.8.htm">8</a>）“一块田地降雨”表出于仁的信之教义；而没有雨水的另一“块”田地则表缺乏仁的信之教义；“游走去喝水”同样表寻求真理。<br />“以法莲被击打，他们的根枯干了，必不能再结果子；我的神必弃绝他们，因为他们不听从祂；他们必在列国中漂流。”（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.16.htm">9:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.17.htm">17</a>）“以法莲”表对真理的领悟，或表信，因为他是约瑟的长子；“根枯干了”表不结果子的仁；“在列国中漂流”指的是那些不知何为真与善者。<br />“你们起来攻打阿拉伯，毁灭东方之子。逃跑，尽量四处漂流；夏琐的居民任自己下到深处找居所。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.28.htm">49:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.30.htm">30</a>）“阿拉伯”或“东方之子”表拥有属天财富、或爱的事物；当这些东西荒废后，就说它们“逃跑”和“漂流”，当他们毫无良善时，就成了“流离”者和四处“飘荡”者。“夏琐的居民”表那些拥有属灵财富者，也就是信的事物，说他们“任自己下到深处找居所”，意思是正在毁灭。<br />“你们所有的官长一同乱走，他们被缚在弓前，他们已逃远。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.3.htm">22:3</a>）这句经文说是的“异象谷”，或妄想，以为信离开仁也能存在。这也解释了接下来第14节所说的“逃亡者和流浪者”，即认同脱离仁之信者对真与善一无所知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]382.</strong> The symbolism of being a wanderer and fugitive on the earth as not knowing what is true or good can be seen from the symbolism of wandering and fleeing in the Word, as in Jeremiah:<br />The prophets and priests wander blind in the streets; they are defiled with blood. Things that they themselves cannot touch, they touch with their clothes. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_4_13-14" target=_top>Lamentations 4:13-14</a>)<br />The prophets stand for those who teach, the priests for those who live according to what is taught. Wandering blind in the streets is not knowing what is good or true.<br />[2] In Amos:<br />One plot has received rain and a plot on which it has not rained is drying up. As a result, two or three cities will wander to one city to drink water and will not get enough. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_amos_4_7-8" target=_top>Amos 4:7-8</a>)<br />The plot that was rained on is teachings about faith that come from charity. The plot or piece of turf on which it did not rain is teachings about faith that are devoid of charity. Likewise, wandering somewhere to drink water is trying to find out what is true.<br />[3] In Hosea:<br />Ephraim has been struck; their root has dried up; they will not produce fruit. My God will reject them because they did not heed him, and they will be wanderers among the nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_hosea_9_16-17" target=_top>Hosea 9:16-17</a>)<br />Ephraim stands for an intelligent understanding of truth, or faith, because he was Joseph's firstborn.{*1} The root that dried up stands for a charity that cannot produce fruit. Wanderers among the nations means that they do not know what is true or good.<br />[4] In Jeremiah:<br />Go up against Arabia and lay waste to the children of the east. Flee, wander far and wide. Hazor's inhabitants have gone down below to live. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_28" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_30" target=_top>30</a>)<br />Arabia and the children of the east stand for the possession of heavenly riches, or of anything touched by love. When these things have been laid waste and can produce nothing good, they too are said to flee and wander, or to be fugitives and wanderers. Hazor's inhabitants — those who possess the spiritual riches that come with faith — are said to go down below, that is, to perish.<br />[5] In Isaiah:<br />All your leaders wander about together; on account of the bow they were put in chains. From far away they fled. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_22_3" target=_top>Isaiah 22:3</a>)<br />This is about the Valley of Vision,{*2} or the delusion that faith is possible without charity. So verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_14" target=_top>14</a> below says that anyone who professes a faith that does not rise out of charity is a wanderer and fugitive, that is, knows nothing about truth or goodness.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Ephraim was actually born after his brother Manasseh (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_genesis_41_51" target=_top>Genesis 41:51</a>), but their grandfather Jacob in blessing them "set Ephraim before Manasseh" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_genesis_48_20" target=_top>Genesis 48:20</a>), giving Ephraim the rights of the firstborn. A note in the third Latin edition refers the reader to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3325" target=_top>3325</a> (see subsection 10), which mentions the displacement of Reuben by Ephraim as Jacob's own firstborn as reported in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_5_1" target=_top>1 Chronicles 5:1</a>.

That to be a "fugitive and a wanderer in the earth" signifies not to know what is good and true, is evident from the signification of "wandering" and "fleeing away" in the Word. As in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>    
 The prophets and priests wander blind in the streets, they have been polluted in blood; the things they cannot do they touch with garments (Lam. 4:13, 14),  where "prophets" are those who teach, and 
"priests" those who live accordingly; to "wander blind in the streets" is not to know what is true and good. [2] In Amos: </p>
<p>     A part of the field was rained upon, and the part of the field whereupon 
it rained not withered; so two or three cities shall wander unto one city to drink waters, and shall not be satisfied (Amos 4:7, 8), where by the "part of the field on which it rained" is signified 
the doctrine of faith from charity; and by the "part" or "piece" "of the field on which it did not rain" the doctrine of faith without charity. To "wander to drink the waters" likewise denotes to seek 
after truth. [3] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; my God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto Him; and they shall be wanderers among 
the nations (Hos. 9:16, 17).      "Ephraim" here denotes the understanding of truth, or faith, because he was the firstborn of Joseph; the "root which was dried up" denotes charity that cannot bear 
fruit; "wanderers among the nations" are those who do not know what is true and good. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Go ye up against Arabia, and devastate the sons of the east. Flee, wander ye exceedingly; 
the inhabitants of Hazor have let themselves down into the deep for a habitation (Jer. 49:28, 30). "Arabia" and the "sons of the east" signify the possession of celestial riches, or of the things that 
are of love, which, when vastated, are said to "flee" and "wander" that is, to be "fugitives and wanderers" when they do nought of what is good. Of the "inhabitants of Hazor" or those who possess 
spiritual riches, which are those of faith, it is said that they "let themselves down into the deep" that is, they perish. [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     All thy foremost ones wander together, they are bound before 
the bow, they have fled from far (Isa. 22:3), speaking of the "valley of vision" or the phantasy that faith is possible without charity. Hence appears the reason why it is said, in a subsequent 
verse (Isa. 22:14), that he who professes faith that is apart from charity is a "fugitive and a wanderer" that is, knows nothing of good and truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 382</b></p><p><b>382.</b>
'Being a wanderer and a fugitive in the land' means not knowing what truth and good are. This is clear from the meaning in the Word of 'wandering' and of 'fleeing', as in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Prophets and priests 
wander blind in the streets; they are defiled with blood. Things which have no power they touch with their garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'prophets' stands for those who teach, 'priests' for 
those who live according to what is taught. 'Wandering blind in the streets' means not knowing what good and truth are.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
Part of one field had rain, and part of the field on which 
it did not rain dried up. So two or three cities will wander to one city to drink water, and they will not be satisfied. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%204:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 4:7, 8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the part of the field on which rain fell' is the doctrine 
of faith that derives from charity, while 'the part or section of the field on which it did not rain' is the doctrine of faith devoid of charity. 'Wandering to drink water' similarly means searching 
for truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
Ephraim has been stricken, their root has dried up, they will bear no fruit. My God will cast them away because they have not hearkened to Him, and they will be wanderers 
among the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:16, 17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Ephraim' stands for an understanding of truth, that is, for faith, since he was Joseph' s firstborn. 'A root which had dried up' stands for charity that is 
incapable of bearing fruit. 'Wanderers among the nations' means that they have no knowledge of truth and good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Go up against Arabia and lay waste the sons of the east. Flee, 
wander far away; the inhabitants of Hazer have plunged into the depths to dwell there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:28,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:28, 30</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Arabia' and 'the sons of the east' stand for the possession of celestial riches, or things of 
love, which when laid waste are also spoken of as 'fleeing and wandering', or fugitives and wanderers, when they achieve nothing good at all. And 'the inhabitants of Hazer', or those who possess spiritual 
riches, which are things of faith, are spoken of as 'plunging into the depths', which means perishing.   In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
All your chief men are wandering about together, on account of the bow 
they have been put in chains. They have fled from far away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2012:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 12:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 'the valley of vision', which is the delusion that faith can exist without charity. This explains why verse 14 
below speaks of 'a wanderer and a fugitive', that is, a person who, confessing faith in isolation from charity, has no knowledge at all of truth and good.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 382</b>
</p><b>382.</b>
Quod 'vagus et profugus esse in terra' significet non scire quid verum et bonam, constat a significatione vagari et fugere in Verbo; ut apud Jeremiam, 	Prophetae et sacerdotes vagantur caeci in plateis, 
polluti sunt in sanguine; ea quae non possunt, tangunt vestimentis, Thren. iv 13, 14; </p>
<p>ubi 'prophetae' pro iis qui docent; 'sacerdotes' pro iis qui secundum ea vivunt; 'vagari caeci in plateis' 
est non scire quid bonum et verum: </p>
<p>[2] apud Amosum, 	Pars agri unius pluviam accepit, et pars agri, super quem non pluit, exarescit; unde vagabuntur duae tresve urbes ad urbem unam ad bibendum aquas, 
et non satiabuntur, iv 7, 8; </p>
<p>ubi 'pars agri super quam pluvia' est doctrina fidei ex charitate; 'pars seu gleba agri, super quem non pluit' est doctrina fidei absque charitate; 'vagari ad bibendum 
aquas' est similiter quaerere quid verum: apud Hosheam, 	[3] Percussus est Ephraim, radix eorum exaruit, fructum non facient,... rejiciet eos Deus meus, quia non auscultarunt Ipsi, et erunt vagi inter 
gentes, ix 16, 17: </p>
<p>'Ephraim' pro intelligentia veri seu fide, quia primogenitus {1} Josephi; 'radix quae exaruit' pro charitate quae fructum non facere potest; 'vagi inter gentes' quod non sciant verum 
et bonum: apud Jeremiam, 	[4] Ascendite contra Arabiam, et devastate filios orientis; fugite, vagamini valde, in profundum demiserunt se ad habitandum habitatores Hazoris, xlix 28, 30; </p>
<p>'Arabia 
et filii orientis' pro possessione divitiarum caelestium, seu' illorum quae sunt amoris, de quibus vastatis etiam praedicatur 'fugere et vagari,' seu profugi et vagi esse, cum nihil boni faciunt; et de 
'habitatoribus Hazoris,' seu qui possident divitias spirituales, quae sunt fidei, praedicatur 'demittere se in profundum,' seu perire: apud Esaiam, 	Cuncti primores tui vagantur una, prae arcu vincti 
sunt, e longinquo fugerunt, xxii 3; </p>
<p>ubi agitur de valle visionis, seu phantasia de fide, quod detur absque charitate: unde quod 'vagus et profugus,' seu quod nihil veri et boni sciat qui confitetur 
fidem praeter a charitate, in versu 14 sequente dicitur. @	1 In 3325 we read successit enim Ephraim loco Reubenis, et primogenitus factus. It is evidently in this sense that Ephraim is here called 
primogenitus.$ </p>
