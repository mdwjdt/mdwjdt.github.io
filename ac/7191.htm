<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7191节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7191.</strong>“神告诉摩西”表某种新的，然而仍延续以前所发生一切的事。这从以下事实清楚可知，我们经常在连续叙述中读到“耶和华说”和“耶和华告诉”，如本章。第1节就出现了“耶和华对摩西说”，然后本节，以及10，13，28，29节，以及其它地方也出现了“神告诉摩西”。这种重复无非表示那时开始的某种新事，然而这新事要与此前所发生的事联系在一起。因为“耶和华说”表示觉知的一个新阶段或新样（参看<a href="2061.htm">2061</a>，<a href="2238.htm">2238</a>，<a href="2260.htm">2260</a>节）。要知道，圣言的原文没有表示停顿的标点符号，于是就是用这种短语来代替标点符号；“and”（译为和、与、同、又、并、以及等）则用来代替表示小的停顿或分隔的标点符号，这就是为何这个连词出现得如此频繁。天使的言语同样是连续的，当然也有停顿；但先前发生的每一个件事都以神奇的方式与接下来发生的事联系在一起。因为天使的观念充满实物，这些实物难以言表，不计其数，并且超出世人的理解能力。因此，前面句子的末尾完全可以与随后句子的开头连接起来，一个系列以这种方式能由多个句子形成。说来令人震惊并且难以置信，天堂的形式就在天使的言语中呈现出来。因此，天使的一切言语都有一种像歌一样的和谐，其中每个词语都以一个音节结束，并如此地一致。我被告知，这是因为天上的每一个事物都视一位神为它的目的。我由此也清楚认识到，思维、因而言语的一切元素都从主经由天堂流入，由此而有言谈一致结束时那种像歌一样的和谐。</p>

And God spoke unto Moses. That this signifies what is new but continuous with what was before, is evident from the fact that we often read in continuation of the text, "Jehovah said," and "Jehovah spoke," 
as also in this chapter, verse 1, "Jehovah said unto Moses," in this verse, "God spoke unto Moses," and similarly in verses 10, 13, 28, 29, and also in other places, which repetition signifies nothing 
else than something new that begins there, which, however, is to be connected with what goes before. (That "Jehovah said" denotes newness of perception, see n. 2061, 2238, 2260.) Be it known that 
the Word in its original tongue is devoid of stops, and therefore instead of them there were such phrases; and instead of the lesser stops or distinctions there was "and," which is the reason why this 
occurs so frequently. Angelic speech also is continuous, with stops indeed, but such that what precedes is wonderfully connected with what follows; for angelic ideas are very full of realities, and 
of countless things that are unutterable, and to man, while in the world, incomprehensible; and therefore the endings of the preceding periods can be fully connected with the beginnings of the following 
ones; and in this way one series can be formed out of many. Astonishing and incredible to say, the form of heaven is represented in the angelic discourse, and therefore in all angelic discourse there 
is a harmony like that of songs, which at every stop closes in a word of one syllable, thus in a unity; and I have been told that the reason of this is that each and all things in heaven have relation 
to the one God as to their end. From all this also it was evident that everything of thought and of the consequent discourse flows in through heaven from the Lord, and that from this there is such 
a harmony in discourse closing in a unity. </p>

'And God spoke to Moses' means something that is new yet continues what has gone before. This is clear from the fact that one often reads in the continuous thread of the narrative 'Jehovah said' and 
'Jehovah spoke', as in the present chapter also. The expression 'Jehovah said to Moses' occurs in verse 1, then 'God spoke to Moses' in the present verse, and in like manner in verses 10, 13, 28, 29. 
And the same use of these expressions may be seen elsewhere. Nothing else is meant by the repetition than something new beginning at that point, which however is to be taken in conjunction with what goes 
before it. (For the meaning of 'Jehovah said' as a new phase of perception, see <a href="2061.htm">2061</a>, <a href="2238.htm">2238</a>, <a href="2260.htm">2260</a>.) It should be realized that in its original language the Word lacks punctuation marks to indicate 
pauses, and therefore such expressions as those in this chapter have been used instead. And instead of marks to indicate minor pauses or divisions 'And' has been used, which is why that conjunction occurs 
so frequently. Angelic speech is likewise continuous, with pauses, to be sure, but every prior matter presented there links up in a remarkable manner with the one that follows it. For angels' ideas 
are extremely full of things, countless and indescribable, that go beyond a person's understanding while he is in the world. Consequently the ends of foregoing sentences can be fully linked up to the 
beginnings of ensuing sentences, and in this way a single series can be formed out of many. What is astounding and unbelievable, angelic speech exhibits within itself the form which heaven takes. For 
this reason all angelic speech possesses a song-like harmony in which each phrase ends with a monosyllable, and so in unison. And I have been told that this happens because every single thing in heaven 
looks to the one God as its end. From all this it has also become clear to me that every element of thought and therefore of speech flows in from the Lord by way of heaven, and that this accounts 
for the song-like harmony in speech ending in unison. </p>

`Et locutus est Deus ad Moschen': quod significet novum sed priori continuum, constat ex eo quod saepius legatur in textu continuo, `dixit Jehovah,' et `locutus est Jehovah,' ut quoque in hoc capite, 
vers. 1, `dixit Jehovah ad Moschen'; hoc versu `locutus est Deus ad Moschen'; pariter vers. 10, 13, 28, 29; similiter alibi; quae repetitio non aliud significat quam aliquod novum ibi incohans, quod 
tamen annectendum est praecedenti; quod `dixit Jehovah' sit novum perceptionis, videatur n. 2061, 2238, 2260.  Sciendum quod Verbum (c)in lingua sua originali careat terminationum signis, {1} quare loco 
illorum fuerunt talia, et loco terminationum seu distinctionum minorum fuit `Et,' quapropter hoc tam frequenter occurrit; {2} est quoque sermo angelicus continuus, cum terminationibus quidem, sed 
{3}mirabiliter ibi antecedentia connectuntur sequentibus; sunt enim ideae angelicae plenissimae rebus, et innumerabilibus quae ineffabiles, et homini, {4}cum in mundo est, incomprehensibiles {5}; inde 
fines periodorum praecedentium cum principiis periodorum sequentium {6}plene connecti possunt, et sic ex pluribus seriebus formari una; {7} quod stupendum et incredibile, in sermone {8}angelico repraesentatur 
forma caeli, inde in omni sermone angelico est concentus qualis est canticorum qui in quavis terminatione desinit in monosyllabicum, ita in unum; et mihi dictum est quod id fiat {9}ex causa 
quia omnia et singula in caelo se {10}referunt ad unum Deum, ut ad finem suum.  Ex his etiam constare potuit quod omne cogitationis et inde {11} sermonis per caelum influat a Domino, et quod inde concentus 
talis in sermone cadens in unum. 	@1 i aliter ac scripta hodierna,$ 	@2 i quod terminationum signa non fuerint, est quia ideae spirituales continuantur una in alteram ne in praecedente interstitio 
moretur cogitatio, et sic sequens non aeque in perceptionem veniat,$ 	@3 quae$ 	@4 dum$ 	@5 i sunt et ineffabiles$ 	@6 mirabiliter$ 	@7 i et$ 	@8 ita repraesentare coeli formam, quapropter$ 	@9
