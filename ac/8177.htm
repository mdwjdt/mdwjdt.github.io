<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8177.</strong>出埃及记14:15-18.耶和华对摩西说，你为什么向我哀求呢？你吩咐以色列人往前行。你举起你的杖，向海伸手，把它劈开，以色列人要进到海中间的干地上。看哪，我要使埃及人的心刚硬，他们就必跟在以色列人后头，我要在法老和他的全军、战车、马兵上得荣耀。我在法老和他的战车、马兵上得荣耀的时候，埃及人就知道我是耶和华了。<br />“耶和华对摩西说”表告诫。“你为什么向我哀求呢”表不需要代祷。“你吩咐以色列人”表流注和觉知。“往前行”表进一步的阶段，一直延续到他们做好准备为止。“你举起你的杖”表神性真理的能力。“向海伸手”表在邪恶所生虚假的地狱所在的地方行使能力。“把它劈开”表从那里驱散虚假。“以色列人要进到海中间的干地上”表为叫那些属于属灵教会的人能安全地通过，没有虚假流入。“看哪，我要使埃及人的心刚硬”表邪恶所生虚假的顽固抵抗。“他们就必跟在以色列人后头”表通过邪恶所生虚假的流注施暴的企图。“我要在法老和他的全军、战车、马兵上得荣耀”表他们即将看见凭主的神性人身的神性良善驱散虚假和推理的成就。“埃及人就知道我是耶和华了”表为叫人知道主是独一神，除祂之外再无别神。“我在法老和他的战车、马兵上得荣耀的时候”和前面一样，表由此知道他们即将看见唯独靠主驱散虚假，以及支持它的教义和推理的成就。</p>

Verses 15-18. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Why criest thou unto Me? speak unto the sons of Israel, that they set forward. And thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and cleave 
it asunder; and the sons of Israel shall come into the midst of the sea on the dry. And I, behold I harden the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall come after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, 
and in all his army, in his chariots, and in his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I am glorified in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen. "And Jehovah said unto 
Moses," signifies exhortation; "Why criest thou unto Me?" signifies that there is no need of intercession; "speak unto the sons of Israel," signifies influx and perception; "that they set forward," 
signifies what follows on continuously until they are prepared; "And thou, lift up thy rod," signifies the power of Divine truth; "and stretch out thy hand over the sea," signifies the rule of power 
where the hell of falsity from evil is; "and cleave it asunder," signifies the consequent dissipation of falsity; "and the sons of Israel shall come into the midst of the sea on the dry," signifies that 
they who are of the spiritual church may pass safely and without the influx of falsity; "and I, behold I harden the heart of the Egyptians," signifies the obstinacy of falsity from evil; "and they 
shall come after them," signifies an endeavor to offer violence by means of the influx of falsity from evil; "and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army, in his chariots, and in his horsemen," 
signifies that they will see the effect of the dissipation of falsity and of reasonings by virtue of the Divine good of the Lord's Divine Human; "and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah," 
signifies that it may be known that the Lord is the only God, and besides Him there is none else; "when I am glorified in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen," signifies, as above, from their 
seeing the effect of the dissipation of falsity and of its teachings and reasonings, by the Lord alone. </p>

Verses 15-18 And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do you cry to Me? Speak to the children of Israel, and let them travel on. And you, lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it; 
and let the children of Israel come into the middle of the sea on dry ground. And I, behold, I am hardening the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will come after them, and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, 
and in all his army, in his chariots, and in his horsemen. And the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah, when I am glorified in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said 
to Moses' means an admonition. 'Why do you cry to Me?' means that there is no need of intercession. 'Speak to the children of Israel' means influx and perception. 'And let them travel on' means a further 
stage, continuing until their preparation has been accomplished. 'And you, lift up your rod' means the power of Divine Truth. 'Stretch out your hand over the sea' means the exercising of power 
where the hell of falsity arising from evil is situated. 'Divide it' means dispersing falsity from there. 'And let the children of Israel come into the middle of the sea on dry ground' means in order 
that those belonging to the spiritual Church may pass through in safety and without falsity flowing in. 'And I, behold, I am hardening the hearts of the Egyptians' means obstinate resistance by falsity 
arising from evil. 'And they will come after them' means the attempt to do violence by flowing in with falsity arising from evil. 'And I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army, and in his 
chariots, and in his horsemen' means that they are about to see the accomplishment of the dispersing of falsity and reasonings by the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Human. 'And the Egyptians will know 
that I am Jehovah' means in order that it may be known that the Lord alone is God, and apart from Him there is no other. 'When I am glorified in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen' means, 
as above, [known] from this, that they are about to see the accomplishment of the dispersing of falsity, of teachings upholding it, and of reasonings, by the Lord alone. </p>

Vers. 15-18.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Quid clamas ad Me? loquere ad filios Israelis, et proficiscantur.  Et tu tolle baculum tuum, et extende manum tuam super mare, et diffinde illud, et veniant 
filii Israelis in medium maris in arido.  Et Ego, ecce Ego indurans cor Aegyptiorum, et venient post illos, et glorificabor in Pharaone, et in omni exercitu illius, in curribus illius, et in equitibus 
illius.  Et scient Aegyptii quod Ego Jehovah, in glorificari Me in Pharaone, in curribus illius, et in equitibus illius.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat exhortationem: `Quid clamas ad Me?' 
significat quod intercessione non opus: `loquere ad filios Israelis' significat influxum et perceptionem: `et proficiscantur' significat successivum continue usque dum praeparati: `et tu tolle baculum 
tuum' significat potentiam Divini Veri: `extende manum tuam super mare' significat dominium potentiae ubi infernum falsi ex malo: `diffinde illud' significat dissipationem falsi inde: `et (x)veniant 
filii Israelis in medium maris in arido' significat ut transeant illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali tuto et absque influxu falsi: `et Ego, ecce Ego indurans cor Aegyptiorum' significat obstinationem falsi 
ex malo: `et venient post illos' significat conatum violentiam inferendi per influxum falsi a malo: `et glorificabor in Pharaone, et in omni exercitu illius, et in curribus illius, et in equitibus 
illius' significat quod visuri effectum dissipationis falsi ac ratiociniorum ex Divino Bono Divini Humani Domini: `et scient Aegyptii quod Ego Jehovah' significat ut notum sit quod Dominus solus Deus, 
et praeter Ipsum non alius: `in glorificari Me in Pharaone, in curribus illius, et in equitibus illius' significat, ut supra, ex eo quod visuri effectum dissipationis falsi, et doctrinalium ejus, et 
ratiociniorum, ex solo Domino. </p>
