<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1163节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1163.</strong>“古实、麦西、弗、迦南”是指众多民族，他们在内义上表属于脱离仁之信的认知，知识和敬拜形式。这从圣言中提及这些民族的各个地方清楚可知，因为这些民族在那些地方就表示这类事物。也就是说，“古实”或埃塞俄比亚表人们借以确认谬念的对圣言的内在认知。“麦西”或埃及表人们想借以探究信之奥秘，并通过它们确认谬念的知识，或各种记忆。“弗”或利比亚表出于圣言字义的知识，他们同样借以确认谬念。“迦南”或迦南人表仪式或脱离内在的外在敬拜之物。所有这些由于脱离仁爱，故都被称作“含的儿子”。这些民族还表简单的认知和知识；“古实”表对圣言的内在认知；“埃及”表知识；“弗”表出于圣言字义的认知。这就是为何它们具有双重意义的原因，既有反面意义，也有正面意义，这可从下面所引用的经文清楚看出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1163.</strong> Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan were individual nations, and on an inner level they symbolize the concepts, facts, and varieties of ritual connected with a faith detached from charity. This can be seen in the Word, where these nations are mentioned frequently, since such is their symbolism there. To be specific: Cush (that is, Ethiopia) symbolizes the deeper knowledge in the Word that we use to confirm false premises. Mizraim (that is, Egypt) symbolizes the various kinds of secular knowledge or facts we attempt to use in examining the secrets of faith and justifying the false principles that result. Put (that is, Libya) symbolizes knowledge gleaned from the Word's literal meaning that — yet again — we use for confirming false premises. Canaan (or Canaanites) symbolizes ritual, or outward forms of worship separated from inward. All these practices, when they are detached from charity, are called the children of Ham.<br />The same nations also stand simply for religious and secular knowledge. Cush symbolizes the deeper knowledge in the Word, Egypt symbolizes secular knowledge, and Put symbolizes knowledge gleaned from the Word's literal meaning. That is why they are taken in both senses, bad and good, as the passages below demonstrate. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1163</b></p><p><b>1163.</b>
That "Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan," were so many nations, by which in the internal sense are signified knowledges, memory-knowledges, and rituals that are of faith separated from charity, may be seen 
from the Word, where these nations are frequently mentioned; for such things are there signified by them; that is to say, by "Cush," or "Ethiopia," are signified the interior knowledges of the Word, 
whereby such men confirm false principles; by "Mizraim," or "Egypt," memory-knowledges or various matters of memory, whereby men desire to explore the mysteries of faith, and from them confirm principles 
of falsity; by "Put," or "Lybia," knowledges from the literal sense of the Word, by which in like manner they confirm false principles; and by "Canaan," or "the Canaanites," rituals, or the things 
of external worship separated from internal. All these, when separated from charity, are called "sons of Ham." By the same nations are also signified simply knowledges and memory-knowledges; by "Cush," 
the interior knowledges of the Word; by "Egypt," memory-knowledges; by "Put," knowledges from the literal sense of the Word. This is the reason why they are taken-as may be seen from the following 
passages-in both a bad and a good sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1163</b></p><p><b>1163.</b>
'Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan' were just so many nations who in the internal sense mean cognitions, knowledge, and the forms of ritual which belong to faith separated from charity. This becomes clear 
from the Word where these nations are mentioned in various places, for these nations mean such things in those places. That is to say, 'Cush' or Ethiopia means interior cognitions of the Word by which 
people confirm false assumptions. 'Mizraim' or Egypt means knowledge, or the various facts by which they wish to probe into the arcana of faith and in so doing confirm assumptions that are false. 
'Put' or Libya means cognitions drawn from the literal sense of the Word by means of which in a similar way they confirm false assumptions. 'Canaan' or the Canaanites means forms of ritual or external 
worship that are separated from internal. Since all of these have been separated from charity they are called 'the sons of Ham'. The same nations also mean simply cognitions and knowledge, 'Cush' meaning 
interior cognitions of the Word, 'Egypt' knowledge, 'Put' cognitions obtained from the literal sense of the Word. This is the reason they are used in both senses, bad as well as good, as becomes 
clear from the places quoted below. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1163</b>
</p><b>1163.</b>
Quod 'Cush, Mizraim, Put, et Canaan' fuerint totidem gentes per quas in sensu interno significantur cognitiones, scientiae, et ritualia quae sunt fidei separatae a charitate, constare potest ex Verbo 
ubi gentes hae passim nominantur, ibi enim per eas significantur talia; nempe per 'Cush seu Aethiopiam' cognitiones interiores Verbi per quas confirmant principia falsa; per 'Mizraim seu Aegyptum' scientiae 
seu varia scientifica, per quae explorare volunt arcana fidei et principia falsi inde confirmant; per 'Put seu Lybiam' cognitiones ex sensu litterali Verbi, per quas similiter principia falsa 
confirmant; per 'Canaan seu Canaanitas' significantur ritualia seu externi cultus separati ab interno; omnia haec cum separata sunt a charitate, vocantur 'filii Hami.'  Per easdem gentes significantur 
etiam simpliciter cognitiones et scientiae, per 'Cush' cognitiones interiores Verbi, per 'Aegyptum' scientiae, per 'Put' cognitiones ex sensu litterali Verbi; quae causa est quod in utroque sensu accipiantur, 
tam in malo quam in bono, ut constare potest a sequentibus locis. </p>
