<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9020节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9020.</strong>“他必死”表诅咒，如前所述（<a href="9008.htm">9008</a>节）。那些将信之真理用于邪恶，从而使它们与自己疏远的人之所以受到诅咒，是因为他们以前一直承认它们。如果信之真理已经被承认，后来却被用于邪恶，那么它就与邪恶所生的虚假混杂在一起，其后果就是亵渎。因为这种混杂就是亵渎，这一点从前面引用的章节（<a href="9021.htm">9021</a>节）可以看出来。为更好地理解这个问题，我们举例说明。当那些为了统治所有人、赚得全世界而想要按自己的意思和喜好分发、指挥属于主的东西，尤其属于与一个人同在的天上生命的东西之人，拿主的一些话来支持他们的欲望时，他们就是灵义上的“窃贼”；因为他们从圣言窃取真理，并把它们用于邪恶。这些人之所以是邪恶的，是因为他们以统治权和利益，而不是以灵魂的拯救为目的。如果到现在为止，他们开始用于邪恶的这些真理已经得到承认，不带有统治权和利益的目的，那么这些人就亵渎了它们，因为他们通过将这些真理用于邪恶而将邪恶所生的虚假与真理混杂在一起。这类人绝无可能逃脱诅咒，因为他们通过自己所行的而剥夺了自己的一切属灵生命。他们剥夺了自己的属灵生命，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：当他们独自一人，独自思考或私下交谈时，这些人没有对真理的信仰，不信主、天堂或地狱。然而，他们比其他人更能口头上宣扬这些事，因为对统治权和利益的强烈渴望驱使他们朝这些事物迈进，作为达到他们目的的手段。这一点在基督教异教派（Christian paganism，暂译）尤其盛行；在那里，被封为圣徒之人的形像被展示出来供人崇拜；这些人也在它们面前俯伏跪拜。但他们这样做是出于诡计，好迷惑并说服别人。</p>

Dying he shall die. That this signifies damnation, see above (n. 9008). That they are damned who apply the truths of faith to evils, and thus alienate them from themselves, is because they had before 
acknowledged them. For when the truth of faith which has once been acknowledged is afterward applied to evil, it is commingled with falsity from evil, consequently there is profanation (that this is 
profanation may be seen from the passages cited below, n. 9021). In order that this may be better understood, let it be illustrated by an example. When those who, in order to rule over all and to gain 
the world, wish to dispense at their own good will and pleasure the things that belong to the Lord, especially those which belong to the heavenly life with a man, draw confirmations from the Lord's words, 
they are "thieves" in the spiritual sense, for they steal truths from the Word and apply them to evils. That they are evils is because they have as their end dominion and gain, and not the salvation 
of souls. If without any regard to dominion and gain these same persons have previously acknowledged the truths from the Word which they now apply to evils, they profane them, for by so doing they 
commingle falsities from evils with the truths. Such persons cannot possibly escape damnation, for by so doing they deprive themselves of all spiritual life. That they deprive themselves of spiritual 
life is plain from the fact that when they are by themselves, and think from themselves, and talk among themselves, they have no faith in truths, and do not believe in the Lord, in heaven, or in hell. 
Nevertheless above all others they have these things in their mouths, because the ardor for rule and gain incites them thereto, as means to their ends. This reigns especially in Christian paganism, 
where the images of sanctified men are exhibited for adoration, before which they bend their knees and fall prostrate. Even they themselves do this, from deceit, in order to mislead and persuade. </p>

'Shall surely die' means damnation, as above in <a href="9008.htm">9008</a>. The reason why they are damned who apply the truths of faith to evils and in so doing alienate them from themselves is that they have hitherto acknowledged 
them. If the truth of faith has been acknowledged, and then after that it is applied to evil, it is mixed together with falsity arising from evil, the result of which is profanation. For such 
mixing together is profanation, see the places referred to below in <a href="9021.htm">9021</a>. To make this matter more understandable, let an example serve to shed light on it. Take people who wish to direct according 
to their own will things that are the Lord's, especially those things that belong to heavenly life with a person, to the end that they may have dominion over everyone and may gain the [whole] world. 
When they take some of the Lord's words to support their desire they are thieves in a spiritual sense; for they are stealing truths from the Word and applying them to evils. They are evils because those 
people's end in view is dominion and gain, not the salvation of souls. If up to now those truths which they begin to apply to evils have been acknowledged without a view to dominion and gain, such 
people profane them; for by applying them to evils they mix falsities arising from evils together with the truths. Such people cannot possibly escape damnation, since they deprive themselves of all spiritual 
life by what they do. That they deprive themselves of spiritual life is evident from the consideration that when they are left on their own, and they then think alone or talk among themselves, 
these people possess no belief in truths. They do not believe in the Lord, in heaven, or in hell Even so they proclaim them with their lips more than others do, because an intense desire for dominion 
and gain drives them towards these things, as means to their ends. This is especially prevalent in Christian Gentilism where images of persons canonized as saints are on display for veneration, before 
which those people too genuflect and prostrate themselves but do so because of their guile, in order that they may deceive and convince others. </p>

`Moriendo morietur': quod significet damnationem, {1}ut supra n. (x)9008.  Quod sint (m)damnati qui applicant vera fidei ad mala et sic abalienant a se, est quia prius agnoverunt illa, nam verum fidei 
quod semel agnitum est, cum postea applicatur ad malum, commiscetur {2} cum falso ex malo, inde profanatio; quod {3}hoc sit profanatio, {4}videatur ex locis infra n. 9021 citatis;(n) ut hoc melius 
intelligatur, (s)sit exemplum illustrationi: qui ex arbitrio dispensare volunt illa quae Domini sunt, imprimis quae caelestis vitae apud {5}hominem, ob finem ut dominentur super omnes et ut lucrentur 
mundum; illi cum ex {6}verbis Domini confirmantia sumunt, sunt `fures' in spirituali sensu, nam furantur vera ex Verbo et applicant ad mala; quod mala sint, est quia pro fine habent dominatum et lucrum, 
et non salutem animarum; iidem si vera ex Verbo quae ad {7}mala applicant, prius absque fine dominatus ac lucri agnoverunt, tunc illa profanant, nam sic falsa ex {8}malis commiscent veris; tales nequaquam 
possunt effugere damnationem, nam per id deprivant se omni vita spirituali; {9}quod deprivant se illa vita, patet ex eo quod cum sibi relicti ex se cogitant ac inter se loquuntur, nullam fidem 
veris {10}habeant; non credunt Dominum, nec caelum, nec infernum; sed usque haec ore ferunt prae aliis, quoniam ardor dominandi et lucrandi ad haec ut ad media ad fines suos excitat; regnat hoc imprimis 
in gentilismo Christiano, ubi idola sanctificatorum hominum (t)exponuntur adorationi, {11}coram quibus flectunt genua et se substernunt, etiam ipsi ex dolo ut fallant et persuadeant. (s) @1 videatur
