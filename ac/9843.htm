<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9843节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9843.</strong>“六个名字在这块石头上”表源于良善的真理的全部性质。这从“六”、“名字”和“在这块石头上”的含义清楚可知：“六”是指全部（参看<a href="3960.htm">3960</a>e，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节），在此是指源于良善的一切真理，如下文所述；“名字”是指性质或品质，如前所述（<a href="9842.htm">9842</a>节）；“在这块石头上”是指铭刻在记忆中，也如前所述（<a href="9841.htm">9841</a>节）。之所以表示源于良善的一切真理，是因为以色列人的名字被刻在两块石头上，一块石头在右肩，一块石头在左肩；人右半边的事物对应于真理所源于的良善，就是源于良善的真理，人左半边的事物对应于良善到来所经由的真理（<a href="9604.htm">9604</a>e，<a href="9736.htm">9736</a>节）。因此，刻在右肩石头上的以色列人的名字表示源于良善的真理，左肩石头上的名字表示良善到来所经由的真理。</p>

Six of their names on the one stone. That this signifies all the quality of truths from good, is evident from the signification of the number "six," as being all (see n. 3960, 7973, 8148), here all truths 
from good (of which in what follows); from the signification of "names," as being quality (as above, n. 9842); and from the signification of "on a stone," as being an impressing on the memory (of 
which also above, n. 9841). That all truths from good are meant, is because there were two stones on which were engraved the names of the sons of Israel, and the one stone was on the right shoulder, 
and the other on the left shoulder; and those things with man which are on his right, correspond to the good from which are truths, that is, to truths from good; while those things which are on his left, 
correspond to the truths through which is good (n. 9604, 9736). Thus the names of the sons of Israel engraved on the stone which was on the right shoulder, signified truths from good; and those on 
the left shoulder, signified truths through which is good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9843</b></p><p><b>9843.</b>
'Six of their names on one stone' means the entire essential nature of truths springing from good. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'six' as all, dealt with in <a href="3960.htm">3960</a>(end), <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, at this 
point all the truths that spring from good, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'the names' as the essential nature, as immediately above in <a href="9842.htm">9842</a>; and from the meaning of 'on the stone' as being 
imprinted on the memory, also dealt with above, in <a href="9841.htm">9841</a>. The reason why all the truths springing from good are meant is that there were two stones on which the names of the sons of Israel were engraved. 
One stone went on the right shoulder and the other on the left shoulder, and things that exist on a person's right side correspond to the good from which truths spring, or to truths that spring from 
good, and those on a person's left side to truths through which good comes, see <a href="9604.htm">9604</a> (end), <a href="9736.htm">9736</a>. Thus the names of the sons of Israel engraved on the stone that went on the right shoulder meant truths 
springing from good, and those on the one that went on the left meant truths through which good comes.  </p>

</p><b>9843.</b>
`Sex de nominibus illorum super lapide uno': quod significet omne quale verorum ex bono, constat ex significatione numeri `sex' quod sint omnia, de qua n. 3960 fin., 7973, 8148, hic omnia vera ex bono, 
de qua sequitur; ex significatione `nominum' quod sint quale, ut nunc supra n. (x)9842; et ex significatione `super lapide' quod sit impressio memoriae, de qua etiam supra n. (x)9841. Quod sint omnia 
vera ex bono, est quia duo lapides erant, quibus insculpta nomina filiorum Israelis, et unus lapis super umero dextro, (c)et alter super umero sinistro; et {1}apud hominem quae {2}ad dextrum ejus 
sunt, correspondent bono ex quo vera, seu veris ex bono, et quae a sinistro, veris per quae bonum, videatur n. 9604 fin., 9736; ita `nomina filiorum Israelis insculpta lapidi qui super dextro umero' significabant 
vera ex bono, et qui super sinistro {3}, {4}vera per quae bonum. @1 in homine$ @2 a dextro$ @3 i humero$ @4 veris AIT$ </p>
