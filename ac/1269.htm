<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1269.</strong> 为让我进一步了解他们的性质，主允许其中一些灵人上到灵人界。在此之前，只见一个身穿闪亮白衣的漂亮小孩出现了；此后，在一个敞开的门口处，一个身穿绿衣的小孩又出现了；再后来出现的是两个戴着白头巾的女仆。不过，这些景象的含义没有透露给我。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1269.</strong> To teach me still more about their character, the Lord allowed some of them to come up into the world of spirits. But before this happened, a handsome young man dressed in white appeared, and then in an open door appeared another young man wearing green. Soon two female servants in white headgear also appeared. What these things symbolized was not revealed to me.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This section parallels <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1269/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3378" target=_top>3378</a> of Swedenborg's Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002), dated September 26-27, 1748 (prior to the 1749 publication of the first volume of Secrets of Heaven). There Swedenborg says that the symbolism of the first young man (as the earliest church) was instilled into him as he was writing. He also speculates on the meaning of the young man in green, saying that he may symbolize the people of the period of the ancient church. After thus speculating, he goes on to say that the two female servants in white symbolize the feelings of the people of that time and (more definitively) that the young man in green symbolizes their knowledge and understanding.

That I might know still better what kind of men they were, it was permitted by the Lord that some of them should come up into the world of spirits. Before this took place a beautiful child appeared, 
clothed in shining white raiment; afterwards, in an open doorway, there appeared another child in a green garment; and then two maidservants with white headdresses. But what these things signified was 
not disclosed to me. </p>

To enable me to know better still what they were like, the Lord allowed some of them to come up into the world of spirits. Before this happened a beautiful boy clothed in a brilliant white garment appeared, 
and after that in an open doorway, another one in a green garment. Then two maid-servants appeared as well, wearing white head-dresses. What these things meant however was not disclosed to me. </p>

</p><b>1269.</b>
Ut adhuc melius scirem quales essent, permissum fuit a Domino ut quidam eorum ascenderent in mundum spirituum; quod antequam factum, visus est puer pulcher vestitus veste candida, dein in quadam janua 
aperta alius puer veste viridi, mox quoque binae ancillae in albo quoad caput; sed quid illa significarent, non mihi detectum. </p>
