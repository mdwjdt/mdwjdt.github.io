<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6595节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6595.</strong>“他们对他进行了防腐处理”表仍旧保存。这从“进行防腐处理”的含义清楚可知，“进行防腐处理”是指防止邪恶败坏的一种保护手段（<a href="6503.htm">6503</a>，<a href="6504.htm">6504</a>节）。由于此处所论述的主题是教会的结束，故有必要阐明“仍旧保存”是什么意思。当教会走到尽头时，就是当教会的内在在人身上不复存在（<a href="6587.htm">6587</a>，<a href="6592.htm">6592</a>节）时所发生的情形；外在仍旧保留下来。但这外在是这样：它仍有一个内在在它里面。然而，此时该内在并不在这个人身上，因为他不思想它；即便思想它，他对它也没有任何情感。不过，它存在于与此人同在的天使身上。由于已荒废的教会成员根本不思想内在，对它也没有任何情感，并且很大程度上不知道它的存在，所以这个人不会对内在造成任何伤害。因为人能伤害他所知道的，尤其他曾一度相信的，却不能伤害他所不知道的，或不相信存在的东西。教会的内在以这种方式得以保存，免得它被某种邪恶玷污。教会的内在事物也以同样的方式被保存在雅各的后代中间。因为他们处于没有一个内在的外在，以致他们甚至不想知道任何内在。因此，教会的内在事物没有被揭示给他们。内在事物没有透露给雅各的后代，免得他们通过亵渎对它们造成伤害（参看<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3480.htm">3480</a>节）；那些不相信教会内在事物的人，尤其那些不知道的人无法亵渎它们（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>节）；在教会荒废之前，教会更内在的事物不会被揭示，因为一旦教会荒废，这些事物就不再被人相信，因此它们无法遭到亵渎（参看<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）。这些就是“保存”所表示的事。</p>

And they embalmed him. That this signifies preservation still, is evident from the signification of "embalming," as being preservation from the contagion of evil (n. 6503, 6504). As the end of the church 
is here treated of, it must be told what is meant by "preservation still when the church ceases to be," which takes place when its internal ceases with man (n. 6587, 6592). The external then still 
remains, but is such as to have within it an internal; and yet this internal is not then with the man, because he does not think about it, or if he thinks about it he is not affected with it; but it 
is with the angels who are with the man. And as the man of the vastated church thinks nothing about the internal, neither is affected with it, and for the most part does not know that it exists, therefore 
the internal cannot be injured by him; for what a man knows, and especially what he has once believed, he can injure, but not what he either does not know, or does not believe to exist. In this 
manner the internal of the church is preserved, lest it should be affected by any evil. So were the internal things of the church preserved among the descendants of Jacob; for they were in externals without 
an internal, insomuch that they were not even willing to know about any internal; and therefore the internal things of the church were not revealed to them. (That internal things were not made 
known to the descendants of Jacob lest they should injure them by profaning, see n. 3398, 3480; and that those cannot profane the internal things of the church who do not believe them, and still less 
those who are ignorant of them, n. 593, 1008, 1059, 2051, 3398, 3402, 3898, 4289, 4601; also that the interior things of the church are not revealed until the church has been vastated, because then they 
are no longer believed, thus neither can they be profaned, see n. 3398, 3399.) These are the things that are meant by "preservation." </p>

'And they embalmed him' means preservation still. This is clear from the meaning of 'embalming' as preservation from the corruption of evil, dealt with in <a href="6503.htm">6503</a>, <a href="6504.htm">6504</a>. Since the subject here is the end 
of the Church, let what is meant by preservation still be stated. When the Church comes to an end, which happens when its internal ceases to exist with a person, <a href="6587.htm">6587</a>, <a href="6592.htm">6592</a>, the external still remains. 
Yet that external is such that it still has an internal within it. This internal however does not exist at this time with that person because he does not have it in mind; and if he did think about 
it, he would not feel any affection for it. But it exists with the angels who are present with the person. And because the member of the Church which has undergone vastation has nothing of the internal 
in mind and feels no affection for it, and for the most part is unaware of its existence, the person cannot do the internal any harm. For a person can do harm to something when he has come to know, 
and especially once he has come to believe it, but not to what he either has no knowledge of or does not believe to exist. In this way the internal of the Church is preserved from contamination by any 
evil, and in the same way the inner realities of the Church were preserved among the descendants of Jacob. For they were so concerned with outer forms without their inner meaning that they did not even 
want to know about anything internal. Therefore the inner realities of the Church were not revealed to them. Inner realities were not disclosed to the descendants of Jacob, lest they should do harm 
to them by profaning them, see <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3480.htm">3480</a>. </p>
<p>People who have no belief in the inner realities of the Church, and especially those who do not know about them, are unable to profane them, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3401.htm">3401</a>, <a href="3898.htm">3898</a>, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>, <a href="4601.htm">4601</a>.  </p>
<p>The more internal things of the Church are not revealed until the Church has undergone vastation, because once it has undergone it there is no longer any 
belief in them, and so they cannot be profaned, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>. </p>
<p>These are the things that are meant by preservation. </p>

`Et condierunt eum':  quod significet praeservationem usque, constat ex significatione `condire' quod sit praeservatio a contagio mali, de qua n. 6503, 6504.  Quia hic agitur de fine Ecclesiae, dicendum 
quid per praeservationem usque intelligitur:  cum Ecclesia desinit esse, quod fit cum internum ejus apud hominem cessat, n. 6587, 6592, tunc manet usque externum; {1}at externum est tale ut in se 
habeat internum; sed internum hoc non est apud hominem tunc quia non de eo cogitat, et si cogitaret, non illo afficitur, sed est apud angelos qui apud hominem; et quia homo vastatae Ecclesiae de interno 
nihil cogitat, nec illo afficitur, et plurima pars {2}nescit quod sit, idcirco internum ab homine laedi non potest; nam quod homo novit et magis quod semel {3}credidit, hoc potest ille laedere, {4}non 
autem quod vel {5}nescit, vel non credit esse; {6}sic praeservatur internum Ecclesiae ne afficiatur aliquo malo; ita apud posteros Jacobi praeservata fuerunt interna Ecclesiae {7}; erant enim in 
externis absque interno adeo ut ne quidem scire vellent de aliquo interno; quapropter interna Ecclesiae nec illis (x)revelata fuerunt:  quod posteris Jacobi non detecta fuerint interna, ne laederent illa 
profanando, videatur n. 3398, (x)3480; et quod illi non profanare queant interna Ecclesiae, qui non credunt illa, et minus illi qui ignorant, n. 593, 1008, {8} 1059, 2051, 3398, 3402, 3898, 4289, 
4601; {9}tum quod interiora Ecclesiae non prius revelentur quam cum Ecclesia vastata est, quia tunc non amplius creduntur, ita nec profanari possunt, n. 3398, 3399.  Haec sunt quae intelliguntur per praeservationem. @1
