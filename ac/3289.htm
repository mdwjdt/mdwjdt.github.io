<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3289节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3289.</strong>“儿子们在她腹中彼此相争”表争斗，也就是此处的主题。这从“相争”和“儿子们”的含义清楚可知：“相争”是指争战；“儿子们”在此是指属世人的良善与真理。因为以扫和雅各，也就是此处的“儿子们”，代表主的神圣属世人：以扫代表神圣属世人的良善，雅各则代表其真理，这从下文明显可知。本章所论述的这种相争或争斗涉及优先权，即是良善优先还是真理优先，或也可说，是类似于良善的仁爱优先，还是类似于真理的信仰优先。属灵教会自最早的时候就有关于这个问题的大量争论。由于这种优先权是下文所论述的主题，故此处经上说“儿子们在她腹中彼此相争”，这表示争斗，也就是此处的主题。</p>

And the sons struggled together within her. That this signifies combat as to which, is evident from the signification of "struggling," as being combat; and from the signification here of "sons," as being 
the natural as to good and as to truth; for that Esau and Jacob, who were the sons, represent the Lord's Divine natural, Esau the Divine natural as to good, and Jacob as to truth, will become evident 
from what follows. This struggling or combat is treated of in this chapter, being concerning the priority, as to whether good or truth is prior, or what is the same, whether charity which is of good, 
or truth which is of faith, is prior. From the earliest times there has been much contention in the spiritual church concerning this question; and because this priority is treated of in what follows, 
it is said that the "sons struggled within her," and by this is signified combat as to which. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3289</b></p><p><b>3289.</b>
'And the sons struggled together within her' means conflict, which is the subject here. This is clear from the meaning of 'struggling' as conflicting, and from the meaning of 'sons' here as the Natural 
both as regards good and as regards truth. For Esau and Jacob, who are 'the sons' here, represent the Lord's Divine Natural - 'Esau' the good of the Divine Natural, 'Jacob' the truth - as will be clear 
from what is stated further on. This struggle or conflict is also the subject in the present chapter, being a struggle or conflict over priority - whether good is prior or whether truth is. Or what 
amounts to the same, whether charity which is akin to good is prior or faith which is akin to truth. In the spiritual Church this was from earliest times a point over which many were in conflict with 
one another. And since that question of priority is the subject in what follows, it is here said that 'the sons struggled together within her' meaning conflict, which is the subject here. </p>

</p><b>3289.</b>
`Et collidebant se filii in medio illius': quod significet pugnam de qua, constat a significatione `collidere' quod sit pugnare; quoad verum; nam quod Esau et Jacob qui filii, repraesentent Divinum 
Naturale Domini, `Esau' illud quoad bonum, `Jacob' quoad verum, ex sequentibus constabit. De collisione hac seu pugna agitur etiam in hoc capite, et {1}est illa de prioritate, num bonum sit prius vel 
num verum, seu quod idem, num charitas quae boni sit prior vel num fides quae veri. In Ecclesia spirituali a primis temporibus de eo inter plures pugnatum est; et quia de prioritate illa in sequentibus 
agitur, ideo dicitur quod `collidebant se filii in medio ejus,' {2}et per illa significatur pugna de qua. @1 fuit$  @2 significet pugnam$  </p>
