<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2490</b></p><p><b>2490.</b>
As regards the interior memory the case is this: There are retained in it not only all and each of the things the man from his infancy has ever seen and heard, and those he has thought, spoken, and done; 
but also those which he sees and hears, and which he thinks, speaks, and does, in the other life. But this takes place with a difference. They who are in the persuasion of falsity and the cupidity 
of evil imbibe and retain all things that are in agreement therewith, for they enter in as water does into a sponge. All other things do indeed also flow thereto, but are retained so slightly that they 
scarcely know that they are anything. But they who are in the faith of truth and the affection of good retain all things which are true and good, and are thereby being continually perfected. Hence 
it is that they can be instructed, and that they are instructed in the other life. </p>

With regard to the interior memory, it not only retains every single thing that a person has ever seen and heard since early childhood, and what he has thought, said, and done, but also the things he 
sees and hears in the next life, and those he thinks, says, and does. But this phenomenon varies. People who are governed by false persuasion and evil desire imbibe and retain all things that suit them, 
for these things enter into them like water into a sponge. All else flows in as well but is retained so superficially that they hardly know it as anything at all. But those who believe in truth and 
have an affection for good retain all things that are true and good and are consequently being perfected all the time. In this way people can and do receive instruction in the next life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2490</b>
</p><b>2490.</b>
Cum memoria interiore (t)ita se habet, quod non solum in illa retineantur omnia et singula quae usquam homo ab infantia vidit et audivi ac quae cogitavit, locutus est, et egit, sed etiam illa quae in 
altera vita videt audit, ac quae cogitat, loquitur, et agit; sed fit cum differentia; qui in persuasione falsi et cupiditate mali sunt, hauriant et retinent omnia quae illis conveniunt, intrant enim 
sicut aquae in spongias; cetera quidem etiam alluunt, se retinentur tam leviter ut vix sciant quod aliquid; at qui in fide veri et affectione boni sunt, retinent omnia quae vera et bona sunt, et inde 
continue perficiuntur; inde est quod instrui possint et instruantur in altera vita. </p>
