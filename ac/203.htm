<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第203节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>203.</strong>属灵的天使会谈论信，甚至以觉性、理性、知识来证实信，但是，他们从不以此为基础来下结论。否则，就是落入恶中。他们同样被主赋予对信之真理的觉知，但与属天天使的觉知不同。属灵天使的觉知是主所激活的良知，与属天的觉知看似相同，实际并不相同。它只是属灵的觉知而已。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]203.</strong> Spiritual angels, on the other hand, do talk about faith, and they use intellectual, rational, and scientific concepts to confirm their religious beliefs; but they never rely on those concepts for their conclusions about faith. Anyone who does so is in the grip of evil. Spiritual angels too receive from the Lord a perception of everything having to do with faith, but theirs is not the same kind of perception that heavenly angels have. The perception experienced by spiritual angels is an ability supplied by conscience and brought to life by the Lord. It looks like heavenly perception, but it is only spiritual, not heavenly. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 203</b></p><p><b>203.</b>
The spiritual angels, however, converse about faith, and even confirm the things of faith by those of the intellect, of the reason, and of the memory [per intellectualia, rationalia, et scientifica], 
but they never form their conclusions concerning matters of faith on such grounds: those who do this are in evil. They are also endowed by the Lord with a perception of all the truths of faith, although 
not with such a perception as is that of the celestial angels. The perception of the spiritual angels is a kind of conscience which is vivified by the Lord and which indeed appears like celestial 
perception, yet is not so, but is only spiritual perception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 203</b></p><p><b>203.</b>
Spiritual angels however do discuss faith; they even confirm matters of faith by means of intellectual concepts, rational concepts, and factual knowledge. But they never use these as a means to arrive 
at a conclusion concerning faith. Those who do that are under the influence of evil. For spiritual angels also have from the Lord a perception of everything that is a matter of faith, but the nature 
of their perception is not the same as that of celestial angels. The perception that spiritual angels have is a measure of conscience vitalized by the Lord. It seems like celestial perception, but it 
is merely spiritual perception and not celestial.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 203</b>
</p><b>203.</b>
Angeli spirituales autem loquuntur de fide, etiam confirmant illa quae sunt fidei, per intellectualia, rationalia, et scientifica; sed nusquam ex his de fide concludunt; qui concludunt, sunt in malo; 
nam etiam illi perceptionem habent omnium quae sunt fidei, a Domino, sed non talem perceptionem qualem angeli caelestes. Perceptio angelorum spiritualium est quoddam conscientiae quae a Domino vivificata, 
et apparet sicut perceptio caelestis sed non est caelestis, modo perceptio spiritualis. </p>
