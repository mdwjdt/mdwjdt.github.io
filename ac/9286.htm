<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9286节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9286.</strong> “一年三次，你要向我守节”表由于从诅咒中释放而持续敬拜主并感恩。这从“守节”和“一年三次”的含义清楚可知：“守节”是指由于从诅咒中释放而出于快乐的心情敬拜主（参看<a href="7093.htm">7093</a>节）；“一年三次”是指直到结束的一个完整或完全的状态，因为“三”表示从开始到结束的完整或完全之物（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="7715.htm">7715</a>，<a href="9198.htm">9198</a>节），“一年”表示一个完整或完全的时期（<a href="2906.htm">2906</a>，<a href="7839.htm">7839</a>，<a href="8070.htm">8070</a>节），在此是指一个完全和完整的释放。因为“无酵节”表示从虚假中洁净；“收割节”表示真理在良善中的植入；“收集节”表示来自那里的良善的植入。因此，这些节期表示从诅咒中所得的完全释放；因为当一个人从虚假中洁净，之后通过真理被带入良善，最后处于良善时，他就在与主同在天堂，并因此经历完全的释放。<br />从诅咒中释放的连续阶段就像重生的连续阶段；因为重生就是被主从地狱解救出来并被祂引入天堂。事实上，正在重生的人首先从虚假中得以洁净，然后他所知道的信之真理被植入仁之良善，最后这良善本身被植入他。这一切都完成后，此人就重生了，这时便与主同在天堂。所以，“一年三个节”也表示由于重生而敬拜主并感恩。设立这些节期是为了永远纪念这些事，故敬拜和感恩被称为持续；因为敬拜中最重要的事要永远持续下去。要永远持续下去的事是那些不仅铭刻在记忆中，还铭刻在实际生活中的事。当情况是这样时，就可以说它们在一个人那里普遍掌权了（<a href="5949.htm">5949</a>，<a href="6159.htm">6159</a>，<a href="6571.htm">6571</a>，<a href="8853.htm">8853</a>-<a href="8858.htm">8858</a>，<a href="8865.htm">8865</a>节）。</p>

Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year. That this signifies the persistent worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of liberation from damnation is evident from the signification 
of "keeping a feast" as being the worship of the Lord from a glad mind on account of liberation from damnation (see n. 7093); and from the signification of "three times in the year" as being a full 
state even to the end; for "three" signifies what is full from beginning to end (n. 2788, 4495, 7715, 9198), and a "year" signifies an entire period (n. 2906, 7839, 8070), here therefore a full and 
complete liberation. For by "the feast of unleavened things" is signified purification from falsities; by "the feast of harvest" the implanting of truth in good; and by "the feast of ingathering" the 
implanting of good thence derived, thus full liberation from damnation; for when a man has been purified from falsities, and afterward brought into good by means of truths, and finally when he is in good, 
he is then in heaven with the Lord, and consequently is then fully liberated.  [2] The successive steps of liberation from damnation are circumstanced like the successive steps of regeneration, 
because regeneration is liberation from hell and introduction into heaven by the Lord; for the man who is being regenerated is first purified from falsities, then the truths of faith are implanted with 
him in the good of charity, and lastly this good itself is implanted, and when this is done the man has been regenerated, and is then in heaven with the Lord. Wherefore by "the three feasts in the year" 
was also signified the worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of regeneration. As these feasts were instituted for the perpetual remembrance of these things, therefore it is said the "persistent" 
worship and thanksgiving, for the chief things of worship are to continually endure. The things which continually endure are those which are not only inscribed on the memory, but also on the 
life itself, and they are then said to reign universally with the man (n. 5949, 6159, 6571, 8853-8858, 8865). </p>

'Three times you shall keep a feast to Me in the year' means enduring worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of deliverance from damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'keeping a feast' 
or 'holding a feast' as worshipping the Lord with gladness of mind on account of deliverance from damnation, dealt with in <a href="7093.htm">7093</a>; and from the meaning of 'three times in the year' as a state complete 
right to its end, for 'three' means complete from the beginning to the end, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="7715.htm">7715</a>, <a href="9198.htm">9198</a>, and 'year' a whole period, <a href="2906.htm">2906</a>, <a href="7839.htm">7839</a>, <a href="8070.htm">8070</a>. At this point therefore complete and whole deliverance 
is meant; for 'the feast of unleavened bread' means purification from falsities, 'the feast of harvest' means the planting of truth in good, and 'the feast of ingathering' means the implanting of good 
from there. Thus complete deliverance from damnation is meant by these feasts; for when a person has been purified from falsities, and after this has been brought by means of truths into good, and is 
at length governed by good, he is in heaven with the Lord and has accordingly undergone complete deliverance.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The consecutive stages of deliverance from damnation are like the consecutive stages 
of regeneration; for regeneration is deliverance by the Lord from hell and being led by Him into heaven. For a person who is being regenerated is first purified from falsities, after that the truths 
of faith he knows are planted in the good of charity, and finally that good itself is implanted in him. When all this has been done the person has been regenerated and he is then in heaven with the 
Lord. Therefore the three feasts in the year also meant worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of regeneration. Because these feasts were established on account of the everlasting remembrance 
of those things, the worship and thanksgiving are called enduring; for the most important things in worship should endure forever. The things which should endure forever are those which have been inscribed 
not only on the memory but also on the actual life that is led. When this is so they are said to reign universally with a person, see <a href="5949.htm">5949</a>, <a href="6159.htm">6159</a>, <a href="6571.htm">6571</a>, <a href="8853.htm">8853</a>-<a href="8858.htm">8858</a>, <a href="8865.htm">8865</a>.  </p>

`Tribus vicibus feriaberis Mihi in anno': quod significet cultum Domini et gratiarum actionem permanentem ob liberationem a damnatione, constat ex significatione `feriari' seu festum agere, quod sit 
cultus Domini ex laeto animo {1} ob liberationem a damnatione, de qua n. 7093, et ex significatione `tribus vicibus in anno' quod sit status plenus usque ad finem, `tria' enim significant plenum a principio 
ad finem, n. 788, 4495, 7715, 9198, et `annus' integram periodum, n. 2906, 7839, 8070, hic itaque plenariam et integram liberationem; nam per `festum azymorum significatur purificatio a falsis, 
per `festum messis' implantatio veri in bono, et per `festum collectionis' implantatio boni inde, ita plenaria liberatio a damnatione; nam cum homo (o)purificatio est a falsis, et dein introductus per 
vera in bonum, et tandem cum in bono est, tunc est in caelo apud Dominum, proinde tunc (o)est plene liberatus. 	[2] Gradus successivi liberationis a damnatione se habent sicut gradus successivi regenerationis, 
nam regeneratio est liberatio ab inferno ac introductio in caelum a Domino; homo enim qui regeneratur, primum purificatur a falsis, dein apud illum vera fidei implantantur in bono charitatis, 
et demum implantatur ipsum hoc bonum, quo facto {2} homo regeneratus est, et tunc in {3} caelo apud Dominum; quapropter per `tria festa in anno' (t)etiam significabatur cultus Domini et gratiarum 
actio ob regenerationem.  Quia ob recordationem illorum {4} perennem illa festa instituta sunt, ideo dicitur cultus et gratiarum actio permanens, nam quae praecipua cultus {5} sunt continuo permansura 
sunt; quae continuo permanent sunt quae non solum memoriae sed etiam ipsi vitae inscripta sunt; et tunc dicuntur universaliter apud hominem regnare, videatur {6} n. 5949, 6159, 6571, 8853-8858, 8865. @1
