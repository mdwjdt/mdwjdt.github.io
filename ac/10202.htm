<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10202节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10202</strong>.“亚伦在傍晚之间使灯燃起的时候，要烧这香”表当真理也存在于其阴影中时，也处于一种爱的模糊状态下的提升。这从“使灯燃起”、“傍晚之间”和“烧香”的含义，以及“亚伦”的代表清楚可知：“使灯燃起”，也就是点亮它们，是指用神性真理光照，由此充满聪明和智慧，如刚才所述（<a href="10201.htm">10201</a>节）；“亚伦”是指神性良善和拯救工作方面的主（<a href="9806.htm">9806</a>，<a href="9965.htm">9965</a>，<a href="10068.htm">10068</a>节）；“傍晚之间”是指爱的一种模糊状态，和随之而来的一种处于阴影中的真理的状态（<a href="10134.htm">10134</a>，<a href="10135.htm">10135</a>节）；“烧香”是指敬拜的提升（参看<a href="10198.htm">10198</a>节）。由此明显可知，“亚伦在傍晚之间使灯燃起的时候，要烧这香”表示当真理也存在于其阴影中时，主对处于一种爱的模糊状态下的敬拜的一切的一种提升。此处的情形从刚才的阐述可以看出来（<a href="10200.htm">10200</a>，<a href="10201.htm">10201</a>节），大意是：天上爱的状态像世上一天的四个时间段和一年四季那样各不相同；良善存在于自己的热，也就是它的爱中到何种程度，真理就在何种程度上存在于自己的光中；因此，当爱不那么在自己的热中时，真理也不在自己的光中。正因如此，经上提到“每早晨收拾灯，在傍晚使灯燃起”，因为“使灯燃起”意味着在那种状态下尽可能多地提升并增加真理之光。</p>

And when Aaron maketh the lamps to go up between the evenings, he shall burn it. That this signifies an uplifting also in an obscure state of love when truth also is in its shade, is evident from the 
signification of "making the lamps go up," that is, to kindle them, as being to enlighten with Divine truth, and the consequent intelligence and wisdom (see just above, n. 10201); from the representation 
of Aaron, as being the Lord as to Divine good, and as to the work of salvation (n. 9806, 9965, 10068); from the signification of "between the evenings," as being an obscure state of love, and consequently 
a state of truth in shade (n. 10134, 10135); and from the signification of "burning," as being the uplifting of worship (see n. 10198). From this it is evident that by "Aaron's making the lamps 
to go up between the evenings," is signified the uplifting of all things of worship by the Lord in an obscure state of love, when truth also is in its shade. How the case herein is can be seen from 
what was said just above (n. 10200, 10201), namely, that states of love in the heavens are varied as are the times of the day and of the year in the world; and that truth is in its light as good is 
in its heat, that is, in its love; and therefore when the love is not so much in its heat, neither is the truth in its light. This being so, mention is made of "dressing the lamps in the morning, and 
making the lamps to go up in the evening," for "to make to go up" denotes to uplift and increase the light of truth then as much as it can be done. </p>

'And when Aaron causes the lamps to go up between the evenings he shall burn it' means the raising up also in an obscure state of love, when also truth exists in its shade. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'causing the lamps to go up', or to burn brightly, as enlightening with Divine Truth, and consequently endowing with intelligence and wisdom, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10201.htm">10201</a>; from the representation 
of 'Aaron' as the Lord in respect of Divine Good, and in respect of the work of salvation, dealt with in <a href="9806.htm">9806</a>, <a href="9965.htm">9965</a>, <a href="10068.htm">10068</a>; from the meaning of 'between the evenings' as an obscure state 
of love, and consequently a state of truth in shade, dealt with in <a href="10134.htm">10134</a>, <a href="10135.htm">10135</a>; and from the meaning of 'burning incense' as the raising up of worship, dealt with above in <a href="10198.htm">10198</a>. From all this it is 
evident that 'when Aaron causes the lamps to go up between the evenings he shall burn incense' means a raising up by the Lord of everything of worship in an obscure state of love, when also truth exists 
in its shade. The nature of all this becomes clear from what has been stated immediately above in <a href="10200.htm">10200</a>, <a href="10201.htm">10201</a>, to the effect that states of love are varied in heaven, just as times of day and seasons 
of the year are in the world, and that truth exists in its own light to the extent that good exists in its own heat, that is, in its love. Consequently when love is not so much in its heat, neither 
is truth in its light. This being so, reference is made to 'adorning the lamps in the morning' but 'causing them to go up in the evening'; for causing them to go up implies raising and increasing the 
light of truth, as much as is possible in that state.  </p>

`Et in ascendere faciendo Aharon lucernas inter vesperas suffiet illud': quod significet elevationem etiam in statu amoris obscuro cum etiam verum est in sua umbra, constat ex significatione `ascendere 
facere seu accendere lucernas' quod sit illustrare Divino Vero, et inde intelligentia et sapientia, de qua nunc supra n. (x)10,201, ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, 
et quoad opus salvationis, de qua n. 9806, (x)9965, 10,068, ex significatione `inter vesperas' quod sit status {1} amoris obscurus, et inde status veri {2} in umbra, de qua n. 10,134, 10,135, et 
ex significatione `suffire' quod sit elevatio cultus, de qua supra n. 10,198; inde patet quod per `in ascendere faciendo lucernas inter vesperas Aharon suffiret' significetur elevatio omnium cultus a 
Domino in statu amoris obscuro, cum etiam verum est in sua umbra. Quomodo cum his se habet, constare potest ex illis quae mox supra n. 10,200, 10,201, dicta sunt, quod nempe status amoris in caelis varientur 
sicut tempora diei et anne in mundo, et quod verum in sua luce sit sicut bonum in suo calore, hoc est, {3} in suo amore; quapropter cum amor non ita in suo calore est, etiam nec verum in sua luce 
est. Quia ita est, dicitur adornare lucernas mane, {4}at ascendere facere lucernas vesperi, nam ascendere facere est elevare et augere lucem veri tunc quantum fieri potest. @1 i boni$ @2 i fidei$ @3
