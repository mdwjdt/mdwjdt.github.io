<p><strong>[NCE]1465.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1465/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_11" target=_top>Genesis 12:11</a>. And it happened when he came near entering Egypt that he said to Sarai his wife, "Consider, please; I know that you are a woman beautiful to see."<br />And it happened when he came near entering Egypt means when he started to learn; Egypt, as noted, means the knowledge of religious concepts. That he said to Sarai his wife means that these were his thoughts about the truth to which heavenly qualities are attached; Sarai his wife is truth connected to the heavenly capacities the Lord had inside him. Consider, please; I know that you are a woman beautiful to see, means that truth from a heavenly source is appealing. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1465</b></p><p><b>1465.</b>
Verse 11. And it came to pass, when he drew nigh to come into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold I pray, I know that thou art a woman beautiful to look upon. "And it came to pass, when he 
drew nigh to come into Egypt," signifies when He began to learn; "Egypt," as before said, means the memory-knowledge of knowledges [scientia cognitionum]; "he said unto Sarai his wife," signifies that 
He so thought concerning the truths to which celestial things were adjoined; "Sarai" as a wife is the truth adjoined to the celestial things that were in the Lord; "Behold I pray, I know that thou 
art a woman beautiful to look upon," signifies that truth from a celestial origin is delightful. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1465</b></p><p><b>1465.</b>
Verse 11 And it happened, when he drew near to come into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look upon. </p>
<p>'And it happened, when he drew near 
to come into Egypt' means when He started to learn, 'Egypt', as has been stated, meaning knowledge comprised of cognitions. 'That he said to Sarai his wife' means that He thought in the following way 
about truths to which celestial things were allied, 'Sarai his wife' meaning truth allied to the celestial things that resided with the Lord 'Behold now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look 
upon' means that truth from a celestial origin is delightful. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1465</b>
</p><b>1465.</b>
Vers. 11.  Et factum, ut cum appropinquavit ad veniendum in Aegyptum, et dixit ad Sarai uxorem suam, Ecce quaeso, novi quod femina pulchra aspectu tu. 'Et factum, ut cum appropinquavit ad veniendum 
in Aegyptum' significat cum inciperet discere; 'Aegyptus' est, ut dictum, scientia cognitionum: 'et dixit ad Sarai uxorem suam' significat quod ita cogitavit de veris quibus caelestia adjuncta: 'Sarai 
uxor' est verum adjunctam caelestibus quae fuerunt apud Dominum: 'Ecce quaeso novi quod femina pulchra aspecta tu' significat quod verum a caelesti origine jucundum sit. </p>
