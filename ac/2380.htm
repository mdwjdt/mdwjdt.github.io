<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2380节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2380.</strong>“关上门”表祂还拒绝所有人接触到他们。这从“门”的含义清楚可知，“门”表让人进入的东西（<a href="2356.htm">2356</a>，<a href="2357.htm">2357</a>，<a href="2376.htm">2376</a>节），因而表进入。正因如此，“关门”表阻止进入。在来世，阻止进入是通过将善人与恶人分开实现的，好叫善人不受谬念或恶欲气场的侵扰，因为地狱的发散物无法渗透到天堂。在今世，阻止进入则通过那些拥有良善之人强有力地反对虚假的原则和说服实现的。每当有邪恶的虚假或虚假的邪恶被灌输给他们时，无论通过恶人的言谈，还是通过恶灵或魔鬼的思维，与他们同在的天使会立刻把它搁到一边，并将其折向这些人已经确认的某种真理与良善。无论他们的肉体遭受多么大的苦楚，天使都会这样做。因为与灵魂相比，天使视肉体如无物。<br />只要人还留在肉体之物中，他的观念和觉察就是一般和模糊的（参看<a href="2367.htm">2367</a>节），以至于他几乎不知道自己有没有仁之善；这种一般和模糊的另外一原因是，他不知道何为仁爱，或何为邻舍。不过，要让人们知道谁是这样的人。凡拥有良知的人，即一点也不愿背离正义与公平、良善与真理（他们不愿意仅仅是为了正义与公平、良善与真理本身，因为这是良知的产物）之人都具有仁之善。有良知的人都对邻舍思想和希求善事，哪怕对他们不友好，并且不求任何回报。他们就是具有仁之善的人，无论他们在教会外还是教会内。那些教会中人都敬畏主，乐意听从并遵行祂的教导。<br />另一方面，凡沉浸于邪恶之人都没有良知。他们不关心正义公平，除非他们能由此赚得似乎看重的名声。至于影响属灵生命的善与真是什么，他们一无所知，甚至将其视为毫无生命之物而加以弃绝。更有甚者，他们对邻舍思想和希求恶事，并且若不支持他们，会对他施加伤害，哪怕是朋友，还以此为乐。他们即便行善事，也是为了某种回报。教会中的这类人背地里都否认主，并且为了确保荣誉、名利或生命不受威胁，他们会公然这样做。<br />然而，要知道，有些人以为自己没有良善，事实上却有；而有些人以为自己拥有良善，事实上却没有。有些人以为自己没有良善，事实上却有，这是因为当他们反思自己所拥有的良善时，他们所在社群的天使会立刻将这善不存在的想法注入进来，唯恐他们将这善归给自己，也唯恐他们的思维转向自己的功德，从而将自己置于其他人之上。若没有这种守护，他们必陷入试探。<br />至于有些人以为自己拥有良善，事实上却没有，这是因为当他们反思这善时，伴随他们的恶魔和恶灵立刻会将他们拥有良善的想法注入进来，因为恶人会将良善与快乐相混淆，事实上还会暗示凡他们为了我欲和物欲所行的善事都是良善，甚至在来世会得到回报，因此，他们比别人更有功劳。与自己相比，他们看不起其他人，甚至认为他们都一文不值，说来奇怪，他们若真有与此不同的想法，就会落入试探，在这试探中也必会屈服。</p>

And shut the door. That this signifies that He also closes all access to them, is evident from the signification of a "door," as being that which introduces (n. 2356, 2357, 2376), thus access. Hence 
it is that to "shut the door" denotes to preclude access. In the other life access is precluded by the good being separated from the evil, so that they cannot be infested by the spheres of the persuasions 
of falsity and of the cupidities of evil; for the exhalation from hell cannot penetrate to heaven. In the life of the body access is precluded by the principles and persuasions of falsity being rendered 
powerless against those who are in good; for whenever any falsity of evil or evil of falsity is infused into them, whether in speech by an evil man, or in thought by an evil spirit or devil, the 
angels who are with them at once turn it aside, and bend it to something true and good in which the persons in question have been confirmed; and this however severely they may be suffering bodily trouble, 
for the angels esteem the body as nothing in comparison with the soul. [2] While a man remains in corporeal things, he is in such a general and obscure idea and perception (see n. 2367) that 
he scarcely knows whether he is in the good of charity or not; and this for the additional reason that he does not know what charity is, and what the neighbor is. But be it known who the persons in question 
are. All those are in the good of charity who have conscience (that is, who are unwilling to depart in any degree from what is just and fair, and good and true, and this for the very sake of what 
is just and fair, and good and true, for this principle is from conscience), and who from having conscience think well of the neighbor and desire his welfare, even should he be an enemy; and this without 
any recompense. These are they who are in the good of charity, whether they be without the church or within the church. If within the church, they adore the Lord, and willingly hear and do the 
things that He has taught.  [3] On the other hand, they who are in evil have no conscience; for that which is just and fair they care not, except insofar as thereby they can gain the reputation of seeming 
to care for it. What the good and truth are that affect the spiritual life they know not, and even reject this as being no life at all. Further than this: they think evilly about the neighbor and 
desire his injury, and also inflict injury upon him if he does not favor them, even if a friend; and in doing this they feel delight. Should they do anything good, it is with a view to recompense. Such 
within the church deny the Lord in secret; and insofar as honor, gain, reputation, or life are not endangered they do so openly. [4] Be it known however that some persons think they are not in good 
when they are, and some that they are in good when they are not. The reason why some think they are not in good when they are, is that when they reflect upon the good in themselves, it is at once insinuated 
by the angels in whose society they are, that they are not in good, lest they should attribute the good to themselves, and lest their thought should be turned to their own merit, and thereby 
to the setting up of themselves above others. Without this guardianship they would fall into temptations. [5] As regards some supposing themselves to be in good when they are not, the cause of this 
is that when they reflect upon it, it is immediately insinuated by the evil genii and spirits in whose companionship they are, that they are in good (for the evil believe delight to be good), and it is 
suggested that whatever good they have done to others for the sake of the love of self and of the world is good that is to be recompensed even in the other life; thus that they have merit above others, 
whom they despise in comparison with themselves, and indeed esteem them as of no account. And, wonderful to say, if they were to think differently they would fall into temptations, in which they would yield. </p>

'They shut the door' means that He also denies all access to them. This is clear from the meaning of 'a door' as that which lets a person in, <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>, <a href="2357.htm">2357</a>, <a href="2376.htm">2376</a>, and so means access; and therefore 'strutting 
the door' means denying access. In the next life such access is denied by separating those who are good from those who are evil, so that the good may not be invaded by spheres of false persuasions 
or by evil desires, for that which emanates from hell cannot penetrate to heaven. But in this life access is denied by false assumptions and persuasions being rendered powerless among those governed 
by good. The angels present with them immediately turn aside any falsity that is a product of evil or any evil that is a product of falsity the moment it is imparted to them whether in the words coming 
from an evil man or in the thought coming from an evil spirit or genius. They bend it towards some truth and good in which such persons have been confirmed. This they do however much bodily affliction 
people may suffer, for angels consider the body to be nothing in comparison with the soul. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As long as a person remains engrossed in bodily things his ideas and perception are general and 
obscure, <a href="2367.htm">2367</a>, so much so that he hardly knows whether the good that flows in from charity is present with him or not. And an added reason why they are general and obscure is that he does not know what 
charity is or what the neighbour is. But let it be made known who such people are. All those have the good of charity present with them who possess conscience, that is, who are unwilling to depart at 
all from what is just and fair, good and true - the grounds for their unwillingness being that itself which is just and fair, good and true, for this is a product of conscience. Also, because of this, 
these people think and desire for the neighbour that which is good without any repayment to themselves, even if he is unfriendly towards them. These are the people with whom good flowing from charity 
is present, whether they are outside the Church or inside. Those inside the Church revere the Lord and gladly listen to and carry out the things He has taught. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 On the other hand people who are 
immersed in evil have no conscience. They have no concern for what is just and fair except insofar as they are thereby able to earn a reputation of seeming to have such a concern. As for what the good 
and truth that affect spiritual life may be, they have no knowledge; indeed they reject it as no life at all. What is more, they think and desire for the neighbour that which is evil, and they also 
actually do it even to a friend, if he does not show them favour, and they take delight in doing so. If they do anything good it is for the sake of some repayment. Such people inside the Church deny 
the Lord secretly; and they do so openly to the extent that their position, gain, reputation, or life are not jeopardized. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But it should be recognized that there are some people who imagine that 
good does not exist with them when in fact it does, and some who imagine that good does exist with them when in fact it does not. The reason some imagine that good does not exist with them when in 
fact it does is that when they reflect on the good present with themselves the angels in whose community they are at that time immediately instill the thought that good is not present. They do this to 
prevent such persons claiming good as their own and to divert any thought of self-merit and so of superiority to others. Otherwise they would sink into temptations.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But the reason why some imagine 
that good does exist with them when in fact it does not is that when they reflect on it the evil genii and spirits whose company they are in immediately instill the thought that good does exist 
with them; for the evil confuse good with delight. Indeed it is suggested that whatever good they have done to others for reasons of self-love and love of the world is good that ought to be rewarded, 
even in the next life; and that being so, they have earned more merit than all others, whom they despise in comparison with themselves; indeed they consider everyone else to be worthless. And what is 
remarkable, if they thought any differently from this they would sink into temptations in which they would go under. </p>

Quod `ostium clauserunt' significet quod etiam omnem aditum ad eos praecludat, constat a significatione `ostii' quod sit id quod introducit, n. 2356, 2357, 2376, ita aditus; inde est quod `claudere 
ostium' sit praecludere aditum: in altera vita praecluditur aditus per quod separentur boni a malis, ut a sphaeris persuasionum falsi et cupiditatum mali non infestari queant, nam penetrare exhalatio 
interni ad caelum nequit; in vita corporis praecluditur aditus, [per] quod principia et persuasiones falsi nihil efficere possint apud eos qui in bono; angeli qui apud eos, ilico dum infunditur aliquod 
falsum mali aut malum falsi, sive in sermone ab homine malo sive in cogitatione a spiritu seu {1} genio malo, avertunt, et ad aliquod verum et bonum in quo confirmati sunt, flectunt; et hoc utcumque 
infestarentur quoad corpus, quia hoc nihili aestimant respective ad animam. [2] Homo dum in corporeis adhuc est, in tam communi obscura idea et perceptione est, n. 2367, ut vix sciat num in bono charitatis 
sit vel non, etiam ex causa quia non scit {2} quid charitas et quid proximus; sed sciendum quinam sunt; omnes illi in bono charitatis sunt qui conscientiam habent, hoc est, qui a justo et aequo, 
bono et vero nihil discedere volunt, propter ipsum justum et aequum, bonum et verum; hoc enim est ex conscientia; ac qui inde bene cogitant de proximo et ei bene volunt etiamsi foret inimico, et hoc 
absque omni retributione; hi sunt qui in bono charitatis sunt, sive extra Ecclesiam sive intra Ecclesiam, sint; qui intra Ecclesiam, iidem adorant Dominum, (c)et libenter audiunt et faciunt illa quae 
docuit.  [3] Vicissim, qui in malo, nullam conscientiam habent; justum et aequum non curant nisi quantum inde lucra possint famam quod tales videantur; quid bonum et verum, quod vitam spiritualem afficiat, 
non sciunt, etiam rejiciunt sicut nullam {3} praeterea male cogitant de proximo, et ei male volunt, etiam male faciunt etiamsi foret amico si eis {4} non faveat, et jucundum in percipiunt; si quid 
boni, est ex fine retributionis; tales intra Ecclesia Dominum negant in occulto, et quantum honor, lucrum, fama aut vita non periclitantur, aperte.  [4] Sed usque sciendum quod quidam putent se non 
esse in bono cum sunt, et quidam se esse in bono, cum non sunt; quod quidam putent se non esse in bono cum sunt, est causa quia dum reflectunt super id apud se, ilico ab angelis tunc in quorum societate 
sunt, insinuatur quod non in bono, ne sibi bonum tribuant et flectatur cogitatio in sui meritum et sic in praeferentiam sui prae aliis, si {5} aliter caderent in tentationes: [5] quod autem quidam 
putent esse in bono cum non sunt, est causa quia dum reflectunt super ilico a malis geniis et spiritibus in quorum consortio sunt, infundi quod sint in bono, jucundum enim mali credunt bonum, immo suggeritur 
quicquid boni aliis fecerint ex causis amoris sui et mundi bonum esse quod retribuendum, etiam in altera vita, ita quod mereantur prae aliis, quos contemnunt prae se, immo nihili aestimant;
