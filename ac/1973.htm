<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1973节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1973.</strong>要描述各种异象太过冗长乏味，因为异象有很多。为了说明，我讲述两个异象，它们的性质由此会变得清晰明了。同时，这些异象将表明，灵人如何被他们所看到的事物感染，以及当看到他人所见所闻的能力被夺走后，恶灵如何遭受折磨，因为他们无法忍受被夺走任何这类事物。灵人没有味觉，相反他们拥有对知道和学习的一种渴望或欲望，这可以说就是滋养他们的食物（<a href="1480.htm">1480</a>节）。因此，从下面的例子可以看出，当这种食物被夺走后，他们会何等悲伤。</p>

To describe all the kinds of visions would be too tedious, for there are many. For the sake of illustration, I may describe two visions, from which their character may be seen; and also at the same time 
how spirits are affected by the things which they see, and how evil spirits are tormented when the ability to see the things that others are seeing and hearing is stolen away from them, for they cannot 
bear to have any such thing taken away from them; for spirits have not the sense of taste, but in place of it they have a desire, or a kind of appetite, for knowing and learning. This is as it were 
their food by which they are nourished (see n. 1480). The nature of their distress, therefore, when this food is taken away may be seen from the example that follows. </p>

To give an account of all types of visions would take far too long, for there are many. Purely by way of illustration, let two visions be recounted, from which the nature of such may become clear. At 
the same time these visions will show how spirits are affected by the things which they see, and how evil spirits are tormented when the ability to see what others see and hear is withdrawn from them; 
for they cannot bear to have any such thing as that taken away from them. Spirits do not possess the sense of taste, but instead they have a desire or kind of appetite for knowing and learning. And 
this is so to speak their food by which they are nourished, <a href="1480.htm">1480</a>. How distressed they are therefore when this food is taken away from them may become clear from the example that follows. </p>

Omnia genera visionum referre prolixum nimis foret, sunt enim plura; licet solum ad illustrationem referre binas visiones ex quibus constare potest quales etiam sunt; tum simul quomodo spiritus afficiuntur 
illis quae vident, et quomodo mali spiritus cruciantur cum surripitur illis videre illa quae alii vident et audiunt; non enim sufferre possunt quod illis tale quippiam auferatur; nam spiritibus 
non est sensus gustus, sed cupido quasi appetitus sciendi et discendi loco ejus; hic est quasi cibus illorum quo nutriuntur, n. 1480; quomodo itaque anguntur cum hic cibus iis aufertur, constare potest 
ab exemplo quod sequitur. </p>
