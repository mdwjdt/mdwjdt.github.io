<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5179节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5179.</strong>有一次，我觉得胃低部有一种焦虑感，这告诉我有这类灵人在场。我与他们交谈，要求他们离开，因为他们的气场引起焦虑，与同我在一起的灵人的气场不相容。那时，我与他们谈论了气场，大意是说，人周转有许多属灵的气场，但世人不知道，也不想知道它们的存在，因为他们否认凡被称为属灵之物的存在，有些人则否认看不见、摸不着的任何东西。因此，我继续说，灵界的一些气场包围着人，这些气场与他所过的生活保持一致，他通过它们与具有相似情感的灵人在一起。我补充说，这些气场也是那产生许多事物的，但它们的存在被将一切归于自然力量的人否认，要么就被他归因于某种隐藏更深的自然因素，比如偶然性。因为有些人凭自己的经验坚信有某种他们称之为机遇的隐藏力量在起作用，尽管他们并不知道这种力量的来源。它的来源其实就存在于属灵气场，它就是神旨意的最后和最低层级；蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在别处描述这一事实，届时我会引用经历来证明它。</p>

I once observed an anxious feeling in the lower part of the stomach, from which it was evident to me that such spirits were present. I spoke with them, and said that they should go away, because their 
sphere induced anxiety and did not agree with the spheres of the spirits who were with me. I then discoursed with them about spheres, saying that there are very many spiritual spheres about man, and 
that men do not know nor desire to know that such is the case, because they deny all that which is called spiritual, and some whatever is not seen and touched; thus that certain spheres from the spiritual 
world encompass man, agreeing with his life, and that by means of them man is in company with spirits of similar affection, and that many things take place thereby which the man who attributes all 
things to nature either denies or ascribes to a more occult nature-as for example that which is ascribed to fortune; for by their experience some persons are fully persuaded that something called fortune 
is secretly at work, but they know not what is the source of it. That this hidden something is from a spiritual sphere, and is the ultimate of Providence, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown 
elsewhere, from what has been attested by experience. </p>

On one occasion I experienced an anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach, which told me that spirits of that kind were present. I spoke to them, telling them that it would be better if they went away, 
because their sphere which created the feeling of anxiety was not compatible with the spheres of the spirits who were residing with me. At that time I talked to them about spheres, to the effect that 
many spiritual spheres surround a person but that people neither know nor wish to know about the existence of them, for the reason that they deny the existence of everything that is called spiritual, 
some denying the existence of everything that cannot be actually seen or touched. So I went on to say that certain spheres from the spiritual world surround a person, spheres that are in keeping with 
the life he leads, and that by means of these he exists in the company of spirits whose affection is similar to his own. Those spheres, I added, were also what gave rise to very many things, the existence 
of which is denied by the person who attributes everything to natural forces or else is ascribed by him to some rather more hidden natural cause such as chance. For experience leads some people 
to feel quite convinced that some hidden force is at work which they call chance, though they do not know the origin of that force. The fact that its origin exists in a spiritual sphere and that it 
is the last and lowest degree of Providence will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described elsewhere, when I shall draw on experience to bear witness to it. </p>

Quondam anxium appercepi in inferiore parte ventriculi, ex quo mihi constabat quod adessent tales spiritus; locutus cum illis, {1}dicendo quod praestet ut recedant, quia sphaera illorum quae inducit 
anxietatem, non convenit sphaeris illorum spirituum qui apud me sunt; tunc sermo fuit cum illis de sphaeris, quod nempe sphaerae spirituales quamplurimae circum hominem sint, et quod homines non 
sciant nec scire velint quod sint, ex causa quia negant omne id quod vocatur spirituale, et quidam quicquid non videtur et tangitur; ita {2} quod sphaerae aliquae e spirituali mundo sint circum hominem 
ejus vitae convenientes, et quod homo per sphaeras illas in societate sit cum spiritibus similis affectionis, et quod inde plurima existant, quae homo qui naturae omnia tribuit, vel negat, vel 
occultiori naturae adscribit; sicut pro exemplo, id quod fortunae adscribitur, quidam enim per experientiam prorsus persuasi sunt quod aliquid occulte operans sit, quod vocatur fortuna, sed non sciunt 
unde; quod tale sit ex sphaera spirituali, et quod sit ultimum Providentiae, alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ex testato per experientiam {3}dicetur. @1 dicens$ @2 i quoque$ @3 A d ostendetur,
