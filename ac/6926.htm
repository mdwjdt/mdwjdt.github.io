<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6926节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6926.</strong>这个星球的灵人成群结队地走动，当聚在一起时，他们可以说形成一种球体。他们被主以这种方式联结起来，好叫他们行如一体，使每个人的知识都与所有人共享，所有人的知识与每个人共享。这些灵人周游宇宙以获取事物的知识，这一点通过以下经历向我显明：有一次，当他们看似离我非常遥远时，他们从那里与我说话，声称现在他们聚在了一起，正要去往我们太阳系范围之外的星空；他们知道那里有那种毫不关心世俗和肉体事物，只关心从这些事物抽象出来的事物之人，他们想和这些人在一起。我被告知，他们自己也不知道要去往哪里，而是在神性指引下被领到这样的地方：他们能在那里获知诸如他们尚不知道，与他们早就拥有的知识相一致的那类事物。我还被告知，他们不知道如何遇见他们能与之联结的同伴，这也要靠神性指引实现。</p>

The spirits of that earth go in companies and bands, and when assembled together, form as it were a globe; they are joined together by the Lord in this way in order that they may act as a one, and that 
the knowledges of each may be communicated to all, and the knowledges of all to each. That these spirits wander through the universe to acquire knowledges of things was made evident to me also from 
the fact that once, when they appeared very remote from me, they spoke with me from thence, and said that now they were gathered together, and that now they were going outside the sphere of this solar 
world into the starry heaven, where they know that there are such as do not care for earthly and bodily things; but for things abstracted therefrom, with whom they desire to be. It was said that they 
themselves do not know whither they are going; but that they are carried by the Divine guidance where they can be instructed about such things as they do not yet know, and which agree with the knowledges 
they already have. It was said further that they do not know how they meet the companions with whom they are conjoined, and that this also is done under the Divine guidance. </p>

Spirits belonging to that planet move in companies and brigades, and when gathered all together they form a kind of ball. They are linked to one another in this way by the Lord in order that they may 
act as a unit, and in order that the knowledge which each one possesses may be shared with them all, and that all may share theirs with each. The fact that those spirits wander throughout the universe 
in search of knowledge about real things has also been proved to me by the following experience I once had when they appeared extremely far away from me. They talked to me from there, saying that they 
had now been gathered all together and were moving outside the sphere of our solar system into the star-laden sky where they knew there existed the kind of people who have no interest in earthly and 
bodily matters, only in things that do not have any connection with these, with whom they wished to be. I was told that they themselves do not know where they may be going but that under Divine guidance 
they are taken to those places where they can be informed about things such as they do not yet know and which fit in with the knowledge they already possess. I was also told that they do not know 
how they come to meet up with the companions to whom they are linked and that this too happens under Divine guidance. </p>

</p><b>6926.</b>
Spiritus telluris illius vadunt per cohortes {1}et phalanges, et cum congregati sunt, formant quasi globum, ita a Domino {2}conjunguntur ut unum agant, {3}utque cognitiones cujuslibet communicentur 
cum omnibus, et cognitiones omnium cum quolibet.  Quod spiritus illi vagentur per universum ut conquirant rerum cognitiones, constabat mihi etiam ex eo quod semel cum a me admodum remoti apparebant, loquerentur 
inde mecum, et dicerent quod nunc congregati sint, et quod nunc vadant extra sphaeram hujus mundi in caelum stelliferum ubi sciunt dari tales qui non curant terrestria et corporea, sed res 
ab illis abstractas, cum quibus esse volunt.  Dicebatur quod non sciant ipsi quo vadant, sed quod ex auspicio Divino ferantur illuc ubi possunt instrui de talibus quae nondum sciunt, et quae cum {4}cognitionibus 
quas habent conveniunt; dicebatur etiam quod non sciant quomodo conveniunt {5}socios cum quibus conjunguntur, et quod hoc etiam fiat ex auspicio Divino. 	@1 seu$ 	@2 uniuntur$ 	@3 et communicatio 
cognitionum cujuslibet fiat cum omnibus, et$ 	@4 rebus quae sciunt$ 	@5 socios altered to cum sociis$ </p>
