<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2425.</strong>“我不能逃到山上去”表怀疑他是否能拥有仁之善，即通过那善思考和行事。这从“山”的含义清楚可知，“山”是指爱与仁（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。<br />至于这种怀疑，情况是这样：那些处于对真理的情感之人拥有在其对真理的情感里面的对良善的情感。但这种对良善的情感如此模糊，以致他们觉察不到，因而不知道何为对良善的情感，或何为真正的仁爱。诚然，他们以为自己知道，但他们是出于真理，因而出于记忆知识，而非出于良善本身而这样认为的。尽管如此，他们仍行仁之善，倒不是为了由此获得什么功劳，而是出于顺服。只要认为这就是真理，他们就会以这种方式行事。因为他们允许主藉着他们视之为真理的真理把他们从良善的模糊中领出来。例如，他们因不知何为邻舍，便对他们以之为邻舍的所有人行善，尤其向穷人行善，因为这些人由于缺乏世俗的财富而自称穷人；向孤儿寡妇行善，因为他们就是被如此称呼的；向寄居的行善，因为他们的确在寄居；对所有其他人也是如此。他们若不知道穷人、孤儿寡妇、寄居的，以及其他人分别表示什么，就会这样做。尽管如此，鉴于在他们对表面真理的情感里面有处在模糊中的对良善的情感，如前所述，而主就是藉着这种对良善的情感而引导他们做这些事的，故他们的内层同时处于良善。在这善里面的天使与他们同在，并在那里以感染这些人的表面真理为乐。<br />但那些处于仁之善，并由此处于对真理的情感之人在做所有这些事时会加以辨别。他们居于光中，而真理之光只来自良善，并没有其它来源，因为主藉着良善流入。这些人不会仅仅因为他们被称为穷人、孤儿寡妇和寄居的就向他们行善，因为他们知道，比起所有其他人，那些善人，无论穷富，更是邻舍。由于善人会向其他人行善，故这些人向善人行善就是通过他们向其他人行善。他们还知道如何区别对待良善，因而区别对待善人。他们将公众利益本身视为较高等的邻舍，因为更多人的利益会在这邻舍里面得到关注。他们承认主在地上的国度，也就是教会，是其要示以仁爱的更高等的邻舍，而主在天上的国度则还要高等。然而，人若将主置于所有那些唯独崇拜主、爱祂高于一切的人之上，就会从主得到各等邻舍。因为就至高义而言，唯独主是邻舍，因而是一切良善，只要这善源于祂。<br />然而，那些秉性完全相反的人则从自己得到各等邻舍，并且只承认那些支持、服侍他们的人为邻舍；他们因称这些人，而非其他人为他们的兄弟和朋友，故会视这些人与他们自己成为一体的程度而区别对待他们。所有这一切表明何为邻舍，也就是说，每个人都照着他所在的爱而成为邻舍；凡具有对主之爱和对邻之仁的人，就是真正的邻舍，但这因人而异。因此，每个人所具有的良善本身才是决定性因素。</p>

And I cannot escape to the mountain. That this signifies doubt as to his being able to have the good of charity, that is, to think and act from that good, is evident from the signification of a "mountain," 
as being love and charity (see n. 795, 1430). [2] As regards this doubt, the case is this. Within the affection of truth of those who are in this affection there is the affection of good, but 
so obscurely that they do not perceive, thus do not know, what the affection of good is, and what genuine charity is. They do suppose that they know, but it is from truth, thus from memory-knowledge, 
and not from good itself. Nevertheless they do the goods of charity, not in order to merit anything thereby, but from obedience; and this insofar as they apprehend that it is the truth. For they suffer 
themselves to be led by the Lord out of their obscurity of good by means of the truth which appears to them to be truth. For example: being ignorant what the neighbor is, they do good to everyone whom 
they suppose to be the neighbor; especially to the poor, because these call themselves poor on account of being destitute of worldly wealth; to orphans and widows, because they are so termed; to strangers, 
because they are such; and so on with all the rest and this they do so long as they are ignorant what is signified by the poor, by orphans, widows, strangers, and others. Nevertheless seeing 
that in their affection of apparent truth there lies in obscurity the affection of good, by which the Lord leads them to such action, they are at the same time in good as to their interiors, and in this 
good the angels are present with them, and are delighted there with their appearances of truth by which such persons are affected. [3] But they who are in the good of charity, and from this in the 
affection of truth, do all things with discrimination, for they are in light; since the light of truth is from no other source than good, because the Lord flows in by means of good. These persons do 
not do good to the poor, to orphans, to widows, and to strangers, for the mere reason that they are so termed; for they know that those who are good, whether poor or rich, are neighbors more than all 
others; since by the good, good is done to others; and therefore insofar as these persons do good to the good, they do it to others through them. They also know how to make distinctions among goods, and 
so among good men. They call the general good itself their neighbor in a greater degree, for in this there is regarded the good of still greater numbers. As still more their neighbor to whom charity 
is to be done they acknowledge the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the church; and the Lord's kingdom itself in the heavens even still more. But they who set the Lord before all these-who adore Him 
alone and love Him above all things-derive the neighbor in all these degrees from Him; for the Lord alone is the neighbor in the highest sense, thus all good is the neighbor insofar as it is from Him. 
[4] But they who are in the opposite derive the degrees of the neighbor from themselves, and acknowledge only those as neighbor who favor and serve them-calling no others brethren and friends-and this 
with a distinction, accordingly as they make one with them. All this shows what the neighbor is, namely, that a man is our neighbor according to the love in which he is; and that he is truly the neighbor 
who is in love to the Lord and in charity toward his neighbor, and this with every possible difference; thus it is the good itself with everyone that determines the point in question. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2425</b></p><p><b>2425.</b>
'But I shall not be able to escape into the mountain' means doubt as to whether he would be able to possess good that flows from charity, that is, to think and act from that good. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'a mountain' as love and charity, dealt with in <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to that doubt, people governed by the affection for truth possess the affection for good within their affection 
for truth. But that affection for good is in so much obscurity that they do not perceive and so do not know what the affection for good is, or what genuine charity is. They do indeed think that they 
know, but they do so from truth, and so from acquired knowledge, but not from good itself. Nevertheless they perform the good works of charity, not to merit anything by doing so, but from a sense 
of obedience. They act in this way insofar as they understand it to be the truth. For they allow the Lord to lead them away from the obscurity surrounding good by means of truth which to them looks like 
the truth. For example, because they do not know what the neighbour is they do good to everyone they imagine to be their neighbour, especially the poor, who call themselves the poor because they lack 
worldly riches; they do good to orphans and widows because they are termed such; to strangers because they are such; and so on with the rest. They behave in this way without knowing what is really 
meant by the poor, orphans, widows, strangers, and many more. Nevertheless because within their affection there is, lying in obscurity, as stated, the affection for good by means of which the Lord leads 
them to do those things, good is at the same time present with them interiorly. Within that good the angels are present with them, and there take pleasure in the appearances of truth for which those 
people have an affection. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those who are governed by good that flows from charity, and from this by an affection for truth, exercise discrimination when performing all those deeds, for they 
dwell in light, and the light of truth has no other source than good, because the Lord flows in by way of good. They do not do good to the poor, orphans, widows, and strangers just because these are 
so termed, for they know that the good, whether poor or rich, are pre-eminently the neighbour; for by the good, good is done to others, and therefore insofar as they do good to the good they are doing 
it through them to others. They know also how to discriminate between one good and another, and so between one good person and another. They call the common good itself their neighbour to a higher degree, 
for within this neighbour the good of a greater number of persons is seen. The Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the Church, they acknowledge as being their neighbour to an even higher degree, 
towards whom charity should be shown; and the Lord's kingdom in heaven to an even higher degree than that. People however who set the Lord above all of these, who adore Him alone and love Him above all 
things, derive all degrees of the neighbour from Him, for in the highest sense the Lord alone is the Neighbour and so is all good insofar as this is derived from Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those however whose disposition 
is quite the reverse derive degrees of the neighbour from themselves and acknowledge as neighbour only those who show them favour and are subservient to them. Calling these and no others their 
brothers and friends, they discriminate between them only to the degree that they make one with themselves. All this shows what the neighbour is, namely that everyone is the neighbour according to the 
love which governs him; and he is truly the neighbour who is governed by love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, but in a different way for everyone. Thus it is the good itself with each 
one that is the determining factor. </p>

`Et ego non potero eripere me in montem': quod significet dubitationem quod posset habere bonum charitatis, hoc est, cogitare et agere ex illo bono, constat a significatione `montis' quod sit amor et 
charitas, de qua n. 795, 1430.  [2] Quod dubitationem attinet, ita se habet: qui in affectione veri sunt, apud eos in affectione eorum veri inest affectio boni, sed tam obscure ut non percipiant, ita 
nec sciunt quid affectio boni, et quid genuina charitas; putant quidem se scire, sed ex vero, ita ex scientia, non autem ex ipso bono; sed usque faciunt bona charitatis, non ut inde aliquid mereantur, 
sed ex oboedientia, et hoc quantum capiunt quod verum sit; se enim duci patiuntur a Domino ex obscuro boni per verum quod iis apparet ut verum: ut pro exemplo, quia ignorant quid proximus, unicuique 
faciunt bonum quem putant proximum esse, imprimis pauperibus, quia hi quod destituti opibus mundanis se pauperes vocant; pupillis et viduis quia ita nominantur; peregrinis quia tales sunt; ita in ceteris; 
et hoc quamdiu ignorant qui significatur per pauperes, pupillos, viduas, peregrinos, et plure verumtamen, quia in affectione eorum veri apparentis latet obscure, ut dictum, affectio boni, per quod 
Dominus eos ducit ad ita faciendum, simul quoad interiora in bono sunt, in quo apud eos sunt angeli, et ibi delectantur eorum veri apparentiis quibus sciuntur; [3] at qui in boni {1} charitatis sunt 
et male in affectione veri, ii faciunt omnia cum distinctione, sunt enim in luce, nam aliunde non lux veri quam e bono quia per bonum influit Dominus; ii pauperibus, pupillis, viduis, peregrinis non 
benefaciunt ex causa solum quia ita nominantur, sciunt enim quod qui boni sunt, sive pauperes sint sive divites, proximi sint prae aliis, nam a bonis bonum fit aliis, et ideo quantum iis benefaciunt, 
tantum per illos aliis; sciunt etiam distinguere inter bona, ita inter bonos: ipsum commune bonum adhuc magis proximum suum dicunt, nam in eo (t)adhuc plurium bonum spectatur.  Regnum Domini terris, 
quod est Ecclesia, adhuc magis pro proximo suo agnoscunt, erga quem charitas; ipsum regnum Domini in caelis, adhuc magi qui autem Dominum praeferunt omnibus illis, Ipsum Solum adorant et super omnia 
amant; ii ab Ipso derivationes proximi deducunt; nam in supremo sensu Solus Dominus est Proximus, ita omne bonum quantum ab Ipso est.  [4] Qui autem in contrariis sunt, ii proximi derivationes deducunt 
a seipsis, et pro proximo agnoscunt solum illos qui sibi favent et serviunt, nec alios fratres et amicos appellant, et hoc cum differentia, quantum cum illis unum {2} faciunt. Inde constare potest quid 
proximus, nempe cuique secundum amorem in quo est; et quod vere proximus, qui in amore in Dominum et (o)in charitate erga proximum, et hoc cum omni differentia; ita ipsum bonum est apud unumquemvis 
quod determinat. 	@1 i ipso.$ 	@2 Before cum.$ </p>
