Verses 15-19. And Pharaoh heard this word, and he sought to kill Moses. And Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he dwelt by a well. And the priest of Midian had seven 
daughters, and they came, and drew, and filled the troughs, to give drink to their father's flock. And the shepherds came, and drove them away; and Moses arose, and helped them; and he gave drink to 
their flock. And they came unto Reuel their father, and he said, Wherefore hasted ye to come today? And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds; and also drawing he drew 
for us, and gave drink to the flock. "And Pharaoh heard this word, and he sought to kill Moses," signifies that false memory-knowledge, noticing this, willed to destroy the truth which is of the law 
from the Divine; "and Moses fled from before Pharaoh," signifies that it was being separated from falsities; "and dwelt in the land of Midian," signifies life in the church with those who are in simple 
good; "and he dwelt by a well," signifies study there in the Word; "and the priest of Midian had seven daughters," signifies the holy things of that church; "and they came, and drew," signifies that 
they were instructed in truths from the Word; "and filled the troughs," signifies that from this they enriched the doctrine of charity; "to give drink to their father's flock," signifies that thereby 
they who were in good were instructed; "and the shepherds came, and drove them away," signifies that the teachers who were in evils set themselves in opposition; "and Moses arose and helped them," 
signifies aid from the truths which are of the law from the Divine; "and he gave drink to their flock," signifies that from this they who are in good were instructed; "and they came unto Reuel their father," 
signifies conjunction with the good itself of that church; "and he said, Wherefore hasted ye to come today?" signifies perception that now conjunction was sure; "and they said, An Egyptian man 
delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds," signifies because true memory-knowledge, which is of the church, prevailed over the power of the doctrine of falsity from evil; "and also drawing he drew 
for us," signifies that he instructed from the Word; "and gave drink to the flock," signifies those who were of the church there. </p>

Verses 15-19 And Pharaoh heard of this matter and sought to kill Moses. And Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he dwelt next to a well. And the priest of Midian had 
seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. And the shepherds came and drove them away; and Moses rose up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
And they came to Reuel their father, and he said, Why have you hastened to come today? And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds; and he even drew water for us, 
and watered the flock. </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh heard of this matter and sought to kill Moses' means that having discerned this matter false factual knowledge wished to destroy the truth which the law from God 
possessed. 'And Moses fled from before Pharaoh' means that it was separated from falsities. 'And dwelt in the land of Midian' means a life led in the Church among those in whom simple good was present. 
'And he dwelt next to a well' means an eagerness there for the Word. 'And the priest of Midian had seven daughters' means holy things belonging to that Church. 'And they came and drew water' means 
that they received instruction in truths from the Word. 'And filled the troughs' means that from there they enriched teachings about charity. 'To water their flock' means to the end that those governed 
by good might receive instruction from there. 'And the shepherds came and drove them away' means that teachers steeped in evils set themselves against them. 'And Moses rose up and helped them' means 
aid brought by truths which the law from God possesses. 'And watered their flock' means that those governed by good received instruction from it. 'And they came to Reuel their father' means a joining 
to the actual good of that Church. 'And he said, Why have you hastened to come today?' means a perception that now it was a certain joining together. 'And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out 
of the hand of the shepherds' means because true factual knowledge that was [attached] to the Church prevailed over the power of the teachings that presented falsity arising from evil. 'And he even drew 
water for us' means that the instruction it gave came from the Word. 'And watered the flock' means those who belonged to the Church there. </p>

Vers. 15-19.  Et audivit Pharao verbum hoc, et quaesivit occidere Moschen; et figit Moscheh a coram Pharaone, et habitavit in terra Midian, et habitavit juxta puteum.  Et sacerdoti Midianis septem filiae, 
et venerunt et hauserunt, et impleverunt canaliculos, ad potandum gregem patris sui.  Et venerunt pastores, et depulerunt (x)illas; et surrexit Moscheh, et adjuvi tillas, et potavit gregem earum. 
 Et venerunt ad (x)Reuelem patrem suum; et dixit, Quapropter festinastis venire hodie?  Et dicebant, Vir Aegyptius liberavit nos e manu pastorum, et etiam hauriendo hausit nobis, et potavit gregem. 
 `Et audivit Pharao verbum hoc, et quaesivit occidere Moschen' significat quod scientificum falsum eo appercepto destruere vellet verum quod legis a Divino: `et fugit Moscheh a coram Pharaone' significat 
quod separaretur a falsis: `et habitavit in terra Midian' significat vitam in Ecclesia apud illos qui in simplici bono: `et habitavit juxta puteum' significat studium ibi in Verbo: `et sacerdoti 
Midianis septem filiae' significat sancta Ecclesiae illius: `et venerunt et hauserunt' significat quod instruerentur in veris ex Verbo: `et impleverunt canaliculos' significat quod inde ditarent doctrinam 
charitatis: `ad potandum gregem suum' significat ut inde instruerentur illi qui in bono: `et venerunt pastores, et depulerunt (x)illas' significat {1}quod docentes qui in malis, se opponerent: `et 
surrexit Moscheh, et adjuvit (x)illas' significat opem a veris quae legis a Divino: `et potavit gregem earum' significat quod instruerentur inde qui in bono: `et venerunt ad (x)Reuelem patrem suum' 
significat conjunctionem cum ipso Ecclesiae illius bono: `et dixit, Quapropter festinastis venire hodie?' significat perceptionem quod nunc certa conjunctio:  `et dicebant, Vir Aegyptius liberavit nos 
e manu pastorum' (x) significat quia verum scientificum quod Ecclesiae [adjunctum], valuit supra potentiam doctrinae falsi ex malo: `et etiam hauriendo hausit nobis' significat quod ex Verbo instrueret: 
`et potavit gregem' significat illos qui ab Ecclesia ibi{2}. 	@1 After malis, but cp n. 6779.$ 	@2 I adds the signification of v 20, which does not belong here.  It is repeated in n. 6787.$ </p>
