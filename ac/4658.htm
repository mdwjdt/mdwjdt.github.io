<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4658.</strong>那些拥有内在听觉的“视觉”之人就属于耳朵的内在部分，他们顺从凡它的灵所指示他们的任何事，并对它的指示作出正确的声明。我以下经历还被指示他们是何秉性。我感觉有一种从我下面穿透上来，靠近我的左侧进入我的左耳。我发现他们是试图挣脱出来的灵人，只是我不知道他们是何秉性。然而，他们一挣扎出来，就与我交谈，说他们是逻辑学和形而上学的学生，曾将自己的思维深深沉浸于这些知识领域，没有其它目的，只是为了被视为有学问，并由此获得地位和财富。他们为自己现在所过的悲惨生活而痛惜，因为他们沉浸于这些知识领域不是为其它目的，因而没有利用这些知识完善自己的理性能力。他们说话缓慢，声音低沉。<br />与此同时，两个灵人在我头顶上彼此交谈；我问他们是谁，被告知，其中一个在学术界是非常有名的人物，我被引导认为他是亚里士多德。我没有被告知另一个是谁。那时，前者被带入在世时所处的状态；事实上，谁都能很容易地被带回他在世时所处的生命状态，因为他的一切生命状态都在他里面。但令我惊讶的是，他把自己安置在我的右耳，在那里说话，声音虽然嘶哑却很理智。我从他的讲话主旨发觉，他的秉性和先上来的经院学者们的迥然不同；因为他写的东西都是他自己思维的产物，这是他的哲学概念的起源。因此，他所发明并赋予他思想不同方面的术语，都是他用来描述内在事物的表达形式。我还意识到以下事实：他是在一种极大的快乐和知道属于思维的观念的渴望促使下而具有这种追求；他顺从凡他的灵所指示他的。这就是为何他把自己安置在我的右耳。而他的追随者，就是所谓的经院学者们则不然。他们不是从思维到术语，而是从术语到思维观念，因而走上了一条反路。他们当中有许多人甚至都没有发展到思维，只停留在纯粹的术语当中。他们若运用这些术语，就能随心所欲地证明一切，并照着他们说服人的欲望赋予虚假以真理的表象。因此，对他们来说，哲学成了变得疯狂，而非智慧的手段，以致他们当中所盛行的，不是光明，而是黑暗。<br />后来，我和他讨论分析学。我被引导说，一个小孩能在半小时内讲得比他在一本书里所能描述的更具哲理性、分析性和逻辑性，因为人类思维，因而人类言语的一切细节都涉及分析，其法则来源于灵界。我继续说，想人为地出于术语思考的人，颇像一个跳舞者，想凭运动纤维和肌肉的知识来学习跳舞；他若跳舞时专注于这种知识，几乎一只脚都抬不起来。然而，即便没有这类知识，他也能活动全身的所有运动纤维，利用它们操纵他的肺、膈肌、两肋、手臂、颈部，以及身体的其它器官；许多卷书都不足以描述这一切。那些想出于术语思考的人差不多也是这样。他赞成这些话，说，若以这种方式学东西，正好走反了。他补充说，若有人想变成傻瓜，就让他这样行吧；不过，还是让他不断思想功用和内在之物吧。<br />之后，他向我展示了他原来对至高无上的神持有哪种观念。他把这位神描绘为有一张人脸，头上有光环围绕。现在他知道了，这个人就是主，光环是从祂发出的神性；主不仅流入天堂，还流入宇宙，掌管并统治其中的一切事物。他补充说，凡掌管并统治天堂的，也掌管并统治宇宙，因为这一个与另一个不可分离。他还声称，他信一位独一神，但祂的属性和品质被指定的名称和其他人所拜的神明一样多。<br />我看见一个女人伸出手来，想抚摸他的脸颊。当我对此感到惊讶时，他说，他在世时经常看见这样一个女人，她似乎要抚摸他的脸颊，她的手很美。天使灵说，古人有时会看到这样的女人，并给她起名叫帕拉斯；凡看见她的，都那些古代在世为人时以观念为快乐，并沉浸于思维领域，而非哲学的灵人当中的一个。这类灵人与亚里士多德住在一起，以他为快乐，因为他出于内在思考；于是，他们便呈现出这样的女人以代表这一点。<br />最后，他透露了他对人的灵魂或灵曾持有哪种概念；他把灵魂或灵称为气（pneuma，希腊语为呼吸），即某种不可见的活物，就像某种以太事物。他还说，他早就知道他的灵死后会活着，它既然是他的内在本质，就不可能死亡，因为它能思考。他接着说，他一直无法清晰地思考灵魂或灵，只有一种模糊的概念，因为他除从他自己那里外，没有从其它任何源头获得有关它的知识，从古人那里知道的也很少。此外，在来世，亚里士多德在明智的灵人当中，而他的许多追随者则在愚蠢的灵人当中。</p>

To the interiors of the ear belong those who have the sight of the interior hearing, and who obey the things which its spirit there dictates, and give fit utterance to its dictates. What their character 
is has also been shown. A kind of penetrating sound was observed from below, near the left side even to the left ear. I noticed that it was spirits who were thus striving to come forth, but of what 
character they were I could not know. But when they had struggled forth they spoke with me, saying that they had been logicians and metaphysicians, and that they had immersed their thoughts in such 
things with no other end but that of hearing themselves called learned, and of thus coming to honors and wealth, and they lamented that they were now leading a miserable life because they had imbibed 
such things without any other use, and thus had not perfected their rational by their means. Their speech was slow, and had a muffled sound.  [2] Meanwhile two were speaking with each other above my 
head; and when it was asked who they were, it was said that one of them was a man most renowned in the learned world, and it was given me to believe that it was Aristotle. Who the other was, was not told. 
The former was then let into the state in which he was when he lived in the world; for everyone can be easily let into the state of his life which he had in the world, because he takes all the state 
of his life with him. But to my surprise he applied himself to my right ear, and there spoke hoarsely, but still sanely. From the meaning of what he said I observed that he was of a genius quite different 
from those schoolmen who first rose up, in that the things which he wrote he had hatched out from his own thought, and thereby had brought forth his philosophy; so that the terms which he invented, 
and which he gave to the subjects of his thought, were forms of expression by which he described interior things; and also that he had been stirred to such things by the delight of affection, and 
the desire of knowing the things which are of thought, and that he followed obediently what his spirit dictated. For this reason he came to my right ear. It is different with his followers, who are 
called schoolmen, and who do not advance from thought to terms, but from terms to thoughts, thus in a contrary way. And many of them do not advance to thoughts, but stay in the mere terms, and if they 
apply these, it is to prove whatever they wish, and to impose on falsities an appearance of truth, in accordance with their desire of persuading. Hence to them philosophy is the means of becoming insane 
rather than of becoming wise, and hence they have darkness instead of light. [3] I afterwards spoke with him about analytic science, and it was given me to say that a child speaks more things philosophically, 
analytically, and logically in half an hour than he would be able to describe in volumes (because all the things of human thought and thence of human speech are analytical, the laws of 
which are from the spiritual world), and that he who wishes to think artificially from terms is not unlike a dancer who wants to learn to dance from a knowledge of the motor fibers and muscles; but if 
while he dances his attention were fixed on this knowledge he could scarcely move a foot; and yet without this knowledge he moves all the motor fibers scattered throughout his entire body, and in adaptation 
to them the lungs, the diaphragm, the sides, the arms, the neck, and all the rest, for describing all of which volumes would not suffice; and the case is similar with those who desire to think 
from terms. These things he approved, saying that if things are learned in this manner, they proceed in inverted order, and he added, If anyone desires to be a fool let him proceed so; but rather let 
him continually think of use, and from within.  [4] He then showed me what idea he had of the Supreme Deity, namely, that he represented Him to himself with a human face and encompassed about the head 
with a radiant circle; and that he now knows that the Lord is that very Man, and that the radiant circle is the Divine going forth from Him, which flows not only into heaven, but also into the universe, 
and disposes and rules these; adding that He who disposes and rules heaven, also disposes and rules the universe, because the one cannot be separated from the other. He also said that he had believed 
in one only God, whose attributes and qualities had been distinguished by as many names as were worshiped as gods by others. [5] A woman was seen by me who stretched out her hand, wishing to stroke 
his cheek. When I wondered at this, he said that when he was in the world such a woman was often seen by him, who as it were stroked his cheek, and that her hand was beautiful. The angelic spirits 
said that such women were sometimes seen by the ancients, and were called by them Pallases; and that she appeared to him from the spirits who, when they lived as men in ancient times, were delighted 
with ideas and indulged in thoughts, but without philosophy. And because such spirits were with him, and were delighted with him because he thought interiorly, they therefore presented to view such a 
woman representatively. [6] Lastly he told what kind of idea he had entertained respecting man's soul or spirit, which he called pneuma - namely, that it was an unseen vital something, as of ether. 
And he said that he had known that his spirit would live after death, because it was his interior essence, which cannot die, because it can think; and further that he could not think distinctly concerning 
it, but only obscurely,. because he had no knowledge respecting it from any other source than from himself, and a very little also from the ancients. Moreover, Aristotle is among sane spirits in 
the other life, and many of his followers are among the foolish. </p>

To the inner parts of the ear belong those who have 'the sight' of the inner hearing, who obey whatever its spirit there tells them and make exactly right declarations of what it tells them. I have also 
been shown what these are like from the following experience. I became aware of a kind of noise coming through from below me, coming up on the left side of me into my left ear. I realized that they 
were spirits who were trying to work their way out, but I could not make out what kind of spirits they were. Having worked their way out, however, they then spoke to me. They said that they were students 
of logic and metaphysics and that they had confined their thoughts to these areas of knowledge with no other end in view than that they would be considered learned and so would acquire positions 
and wealth. They moaned about the wretched life they now led, for they had become steeped in those areas of knowledge for no other purpose, and so had not used this to bring perfection to their power 
of reason. Their speech was slow and muted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Meanwhile two were talking to each other overhead, and I asked who they were. I was told that one of them was a very renowned figure in the learned 
world, and I was led to believe that he was Aristotle. Who the second one was, I was not told. The first of them was at that point taken back to a state he had passed through when he lived in the world; 
for anyone can easily be taken back to a state of his life when in the world because every state of his life is present within him. But to my surprise he positioned himself at my right ear and there 
spoke in a hoarse yet intelligible voice. From the meaning conveyed in his utterances I became aware that he was of an entirely different disposition from those schoolmen who had emerged first, in that 
the things he had written were the product of his own thought and that this was the origin of his philosophical ideas. Consequently the terms which he invented and gave to different facets of his 
thoughts were verbal expressions by which he described the things of an interior kind. I also became aware of the fact that he had been prompted to engage in such pursuits by a great delight and a desire 
to know the ideas that are part of thought, and that he followed obediently whatever his spirit had told him. This was why he had positioned himself at my right ear. His followers, called the Schoolmen,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
are different. They do not proceed from thought to terms but from terms to ideas comprising thought, and so go down the road from the opposite end. Indeed, many do not even set off down it to 
these ideas but stay with terms; and if they use these it is to prove whatever they like, and to give falsities an appearance of truth, in keeping with their desire to convince people of these. Consequently 
their pursuit of philosophy serves to make them stupid rather than wise persons, so that darkness prevails among them instead of light. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 I talked to them after that about the science of analysis, 
and I was led to say that a small child speaking for merely half an hour presents more philosophy, analysis, and logic than he could have done in volumes describing them, for the reason that 
every detail of human thought and consequently of human speech involves analysis, the laws of which originate in the spiritual world. I went on to say that anyone who wishes in his thinking to begin in 
an artificial way with terms is not unlike a dancer who wishes to start to learn how to dance from what he knows about motor fibres and muscles. If in trying to dance he fixed his mind simply on his 
knowledge of these he could scarcely lift a foot. Yet even without that knowledge he moves all his motor fibres spread throughout the whole body, using them to operate his lungs, diaphragm, sides, arms, 
neck, and every other part of the body, to describe all of which many volumes would not be sufficient. Similar to such a dancer were those who wish in their thinking to begin with terms. He agreed 
with what I said and declared that if that is the way people learn they are proceeding in the wrong direction. If anyone wished to be so stupid, he added, then let him go that way; even so, let him always 
keep in mind what is useful and what is interior. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 After this he showed me what kind of idea he had had about the Supreme Deity. He had represented Him to himself as one with a human face 
and a halo around his head. He now knew that the Lord was that Person, that the halo was the Divine as this proceeded from Him, and that He flowed not only into heaven but also into the whole world, disposing 
and ruling over these. He added that the one who disposes and rules heaven also disposes and rules the whole world because the one is inseparable from the other. He also declared that he had 
believed in one God alone whose attributes and qualities had been designated by the same number of names as there were gods whom others worshipped. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 I saw a woman who was reaching out her hand, 
desiring to stroke his cheek. When I wondered at this he said that while in the world he had often seen a woman like this one who seemed to be stroking his cheek, and that her hand had been beautiful. 
Angelic spirits said that women like her had been seen on occasions by people in early times who gave the name Pallas to them, and that whoever had appeared to him had been one of those spirits who, 
when they had lived as people in ancient times, had taken delight in ideas and so had gone into the field of thought, though not into philosophy. And since such spirits had resided with him and had taken 
delight in him because he had begun in his thinking with that which was interior they had put forward such a woman to represent this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Finally he intimated what kind of idea he had had about 
the human soul or spirit, which he called pneuma, namely something living but invisible, like something ethereal. He also said that he had known his spirit would live on after death because it was his 
inward essential self which, having the ability to think, could not die. He then went on to say that he had not been able to have any clear thought about the soul, only an obscure one, because his only 
source of knowledge about it was himself and, to a small extent, what he had received from the ancients. Aristotle himself lives among intelligent spirits in the next life, but many of his followers 
dwell among people who are stupid.

Ad interiora auris pertinent illi qui interioris auditus visum habent, et {1}oboediunt quae spiritus ejus ibi dictat, et dictamina ejus congruenter proferunt; quales illi sunt, etiam ostensum est. 
 Appercipiebatur sonorum quoddam penetrans ab infra juxta sinistrum latus usque ad aurem sinistram; animadverti quod essent spiritus qui ita eniti conabantur, sed quales essent, non potui scire; 
quando autem enisi sunt, loquebantur mecum, dicentes quod fuerint logici et metaphysici, et quod talibus immerserint cogitationes suas, absque alio fine quam ut eruditi audirent, et sic ad honores 
et {2} opes venirent, lamentantes quod nunc miseram vitam agant, ex causa quia absque alio usu imbuerunt illa et sic non rationale suum per illa perfecerunt; erat loquela illorum tarda et mute sonans. 
 Interea locuti sunt inter se bini supra caput, et cum quaesitum 2 quinam essent, dictum quod unus illorum esset famigeratissimus quidam in orbe litterato, et dabatur mihi credere quod esset Aristoteles; 
alter quinam esset, non dicebatur; ille tunc mittebatur in statum in quo fuit cum vixit in mundo; quilibet enim in statum suae vitae quem habuit in mundo, facile mitti potest quia omnem 
vitae suae statum secum habet: {3}at quod miratus, {4}applicabat se ad dextram aurem et ibi {5}loquebatur rauce sed usque sine; ex loquelae ejus sensu appercepi quod is prorsus alio genio esset quam 
scholastici illi qui primum {6}emerserunt, quod nempe is ex cogitatione sua excluserit illa quae scripserat et inde philosophica sua produxerit, sic ut termini quos invenit et quos imposuit rebus 
cogitationis, essent formulae {7}quibus descripsit interiora, tum quod ex jucundo affectionis et {8}desiderio sciendi illa quae essent cogitationis, ad talia excitatus fuerit, et quod secutus oboedienter 
{9} quae dictaverat ejus spiritus; quapropter is ad dextram aurem {10}se applicuit; aliter quam (t)asseclae ejus qui scholastici vocantur, qui non ex cogitatione ad terminos sed a terminis 
ad cogitationes eunt, ita via contraria; et plures illorum ne quidem ad cogitationes, sed solum haerent in terminis, quos si applicant, est ad confirmandum quicquid volunt, et ad imponendum in falsis 
speciem veri secundum cupidinem persuadendi; inde illis philosophica sunt media insaniendi potius quam sapiendi, 3 et inde illis tenebrae loco lucis.  Locutus cum illo dein de Scientia Analytica, 
et dabatur dicere quod puerulus per dimidium horae plus philosophice, analytice, et logice loquatur, quam ille potuisset per volumina describere, ex causa quia omnia cogitationis et inde loquelae 
humanae sunt analytica quorum leges sunt ex mundo spirituali; et qui artificialiter ex terminis cogitare vult, quod is non absimilis sit saltatori qui vult discere saltare ex scientia motricium fibrarum 
et musculorum, in qua si haereret animus ejus cum saltat, tunc vix movere posset pedem; et tamen is absque scientia illa movet omnes fibras motrices sparsas circum universum corpus, et applicate 
pulmones, diaphragma, latera, brachia, collum, et reliqua {11}, quibus omnibus describendis non sufficerent volumina; et quod similiter se habeat cum illis cui ex terminis volunt cogitare; haec 
ille approbavit, dicens si illa via addiscantur, quod inverso ordine procedant; addens, si quis fatuus esse velit, {12} ita procedat, sed cogitet 4 jugiter de usu et ex interiore.  Dein mihi ostendit 
qualem ideam habuerat de Summo Numine, quod nempe repraesentaverit sibi Illum facie humana circum caput cinctum circulo radioso; et quod nunc sciat quod Dominus sit Ipse Ille Homo et quod circulus 
radiosus sit Divinum ab Ipso, quod non modo influit in caelum sed etiam in universum, {13}ac disponit et regit illa; addens, qui caelum disponit et regit, etiam disponit et regit universum quia 
unum ab altero separari nequit; et quoque dixit quod crediderit solum unum Deum, cujus attributa et qualitates insigniverant tot nominibus quot alii deos coluerunt.  5 Visa mihi mulier quae exporrigebat 
manum suam volens genam mulcere, quod cum miratus sum, dixit quod cum (t)in mundo fuit, talis mulier ei {14}saepe visa sit quae quasi mulceret ejus genam, et quod ejus manus pulchra fuisset; 
spiritus angelici dicebant quod tales priscis quandoque visae fuerint et ab illis vocatae `Pallades', et quod apparuerit ei ex spiritibus qui {15}cum homines antiquis temporibus vixerunt, delectati 
fuerunt ideis et indulserunt cogitationibus, sed absque philosophia, et quia tales apud illum fuerunt et delectati illo quia cogitavit ab interiore, repraesentative talem mulierem stiterunt.  6 
Ultimo indicavit qualem ideam habuerat de anima seu spiritu hominis, quem vocabat `pneuma', quod nempe esset inconspicuum vitale sicut aliquid aetheris; et dixit quod noverit spiritum suum victurum 
post mortem quia esset essentia ejus interior quae non potest mori quia potest cogitare; et quod praeterea de eo non distincte cogitare potuerit, sed modo obscure, quia aliunde {16}de illo aliquam 
cognitionem non habuerat quam ex se, et parumper etiam ex antiquis.  Praeterea Aristoteles est inter sanos spiritus in altera vita, et plures ejus asseclae inter fatuos.      @1 obediant$      @2
