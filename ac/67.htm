<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">二、创世记第二章</h4><br /><strong>67.</strong>因主的慈悲，我懂得了圣经的内义，其中隐藏着前所未知的奥秘。人不得而知，除非他了解灵界的性质，因为圣经的内义多有关于灵界。我既了解了，就可以揭示这多年来与精灵并天使交往的所见所闻。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]67.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_67/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_1-25" target=_top>Genesis 2</a><br />THE Lord in his divine mercy has given me the opportunity to learn the inner meaning of the Word, which contains deeply hidden secrets that no one has ever been aware of before. No one can become aware of them without learning how things stand in the other life, since almost all of the Word's inner meaning looks, speaks, and points to that life. For these reasons, I have been granted the privilege of disclosing what I have heard and seen over the past several years of interaction with spirits and angels. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 67</b></p><p><b>67.</b>
CHAPTER 2 As of the Lord's Divine mercy it has been given me to know the internal meaning of the Word, in which are contained deepest arcana that have not before come to anyone's knowledge, nor can 
come unless the nature of the other life is known (for very many things of the Word's internal sense have regard to, describe, and involve those of that life), I am permitted to disclose what I have heard 
and seen during some years in which it has been granted me to be in the company of spirits and angels. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 67</b></p><p><b>67.</b>
Since the Lord's Divine mercy has allowed me to know the internal sense of the Word, and since that sense contains very deep arcana which have never entered the knowledge of anyone before now, and never 
can unless people know the way things exist in the next life - for most of what is in the internal sense of the Word focuses on, tells about, and embodies those things - I have been given leave to 
disclose what I have heard and seen during the several years now in which I have been allowed to associate with spirits and angels.

</p><b>67.</b>
QUIA, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, datum est scire sensum internum Verbi, et in illo continentur arcanissima quae nusquam prius in alicujus cognitionem venerunt, nec venire possunt nisi sciant quomodo 
se habent res in altera vita, nam perplurima quae in interno sensu Verbi sunt, illa spectant, memorant et involvunt, concessum est aperire illa quae nunc per aliquot annos, quibus interesse datum 
consortio {x}spirituum et angelorum audivi et vidi. </p>
