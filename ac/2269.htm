<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2269节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2269.</strong>“祂说，我在那里若找到四十五个，就不毁灭这城”表若良善能与真理结合，人类就不会灭亡。这从数字“四十五”的含义清楚可知，“四十五”是指结合。前面早已说明，简单数字即便相乘后也会保留它们的含义。所以，较大数字的含义和较小数字的一样。四十五也是如此，这个数字是五乘以九的结果，由于它是五乘以九的结果，故它具有如“五”和“九”那样的含义。“五”表一些或少许，如前所示（<a href="649.htm">649</a>节），“九”表结合，或结合之物 （<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>节）；故此处的含义是：若良善已在某种程度上与真理结合。在圣言中，数字表示真实事物或状态，这从前面有关“五十”的论述（<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>节）和有关数字的说明（<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="1963.htm">1963</a>，<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>节）明显看出来。<br />正是由于“五”表一些或少许，“四十五”表结合 ，所以本节对这些数字的运用具有这样的性质。也就是说，经上先是说“假若这五十个义人少了五个”，以此表示若少了些许；然后说“你就因为少了五个而毁灭全城吗”，以此表示他们会因为缺了这少许而灭亡吗？但此后，由于五表少许，故经上没有再次使用数字五，而是说“我在那里若找到四十五个，就不毁灭这城”，以此表示若良善能与真理结合，他们就不会灭亡。经上之所以在此说“四十五”，而不说“五十少了五个”，还因为“五”不仅表少许（如前所示，<a href="649.htm">649</a>节），还表分离，这在第一卷（<a href="1686.htm">1686</a>节）已说明。为了所表示的是结合，而非分离，故经上用了四十五这个数字。因为“四十五”表某种结合，如前所述。因此，就内义而言，一切细节都以其各自的优美次序而相继发生。<br />至于良善与真理的结合，这是一个无法以普通头脑所能理解的方式来描述的奥秘，我在此只给予简要解释。真理越纯正和纯粹，来自主的良善就越能更好地适应这作为其接受器皿的真理；而真理越不纯正和纯粹，来自主的良善就越不能适应这真理。因为它们必须彼此对应，这二者的结合就是照着对应程度而实现的。良善绝不可能被注入到虚假中，邪恶也绝不可能被注入到作为接受良善器皿的真理中。因为它们具有相反的性质和特征，这一个必像逐出仇敌那样逐出另一个。事实上，若它们试图结合起来，这一个会吐出另一个。也就是说，良善会吐出邪恶，仿佛它是毒药，而邪恶也会吐出良善，仿佛它是催吐剂。良善与真理之间的这种敌对性是主已规定的，以防止它们有混和的可能性。若它们混合，这人必要灭亡。在骗子和伪善者里面，它们接近结合，但主仍小心翼翼，以防止它们结合起来。这就是为何在来世，骗子和伪善者的遭遇比其他人更可怕的原因。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2269</b></p><p><b>2269.</b>
And He said, I will not destroy it if I find there forty and five. That this signifies that man should not perish if good and truth could be conjoined together, is evident from the signification of the 
number forty-five, as being conjunction. It has been already shown that the simple numbers retain their signification even when they are multiplied; and that consequently the greater numbers have a 
signification similar to that of the less; and such is the case with forty-five, which number is compounded by the multiplication of five into nine; and as it has been compounded by the multiplication 
of five into nine, it has the same signification as have "five" and "nine." That "five" signifies a little, was shown above (n. 649), and that "nine" signifies conjunction, or what is conjoined (n. 
2075); and thus the signification here is: If goods have in some measure been conjoined with truths. That in the Word numbers signify actual things, or states, is evident from what was said about fifty 
(n. 2252); also from what has been shown before concerning numbers (n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988). [2] It is because "five" signifies a little, and "forty-five" conjunction, that 
the very setting forth of these numbers in this verse is of such a nature, for it is said, "Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous;" and by this is signified, If there should be somewhat 
less; and then it is said, "Wilt Thou destroy all the city for five?" by which is signified, Shall they perish for the little which is wanting? For as "five" signifies a little, this number is 
not employed again, but it is said, "I will not destroy it if I find there forty and five;" by which is signified that they would not perish if good and truth could be conjoined together. The reason 
also of its being said here "forty and five," and not "if there lack five of fifty," is because "five" not only signifies a little (as was shown, n. 649), but also signifies disjunction (as was likewise 
shown in volume 1, n. 1686); and therefore in order that not disjunction, but conjunction, might be signified, this number forty-five is named; for "forty-five" denotes some conjunction, as stated 
above; and thus in the internal sense all things follow on in a beautiful sequence Of their own. [3] As regards the conjunction of good with truth, it is an arcanum which cannot be described so that 
it can be grasped by the ordinary comprehension. It must be told in a few words. The more genuine and pure the truth, the better can the good which is from the Lord be adapted into it as its recipient 
vessel; but the less genuine and pure the truth, the less can the good which is from the Lord be adapted into it; for they must correspond to each other, and the conjunction of the two is effected according 
to the correspondence. Goods cannot possibly be insinuated into falsities, nor evils into truths, as their recipient vessels; for they are of a contrary character and nature, the one casting out 
the other as its enemy; nay, should they attempt to conjoin themselves together, the one would spew out the other, that is to say, good would spew out evil as if it were poison, and evil would spew 
out good as if it were an emetic. Such enmity between good and evil has been provided by the Lord in order to prevent the possibility of their being commingled, for if they were commingled, the man would 
perish. In the deceitful and in hypocrites they are not far from being conjoined together, but still precautions are taken by the Lord in order to prevent their being so conjoined. This is the reason 
why in the other life those who are deceitful and those who are hypocrites suffer things more direful than those which are suffered by any others. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2269</b></p><p><b>2269.</b>
'And He said, I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there' means that mankind would not perish if [goods and truths] could be joined together. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'forty-five' 
as a joining together. It has been shown already that simple numbers retain their own meaning even when they are multiplied; and so larger numbers have a similar meaning to smaller. So it is with 
'forty- five', a number which is the product of five times nine; and because it is the product of five times nine it has the same meaning as five and nine. 'Five' means that which is small, as has 
been shown already in <a href="649.htm">649</a>, and 'nine' means conjunction or that which is joined together, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>; so that the meaning here is, If goods have in some measure been joined to truths. That numbers in the Word 
mean real things or else states is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="2252.htm">2252</a> about 'fifty', and also from what has been shown already concerning numbers, in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1963.htm">1963</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is because 'five' means that which is small, and 'forty-five' a joining together, that those numbers are used in the way they are in this verse. That is to say, first it is said, 
'Perhaps the fifty righteous persons will lack five', which means, If it were something less. Then it is said, 'Will You for five destroy the whole city?' which means, Will they perish for the small amount 
that is lacking? But after that, because five means a small amount, the number five is not used again but it is said, 'I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there', which means that they would 
not perish if [goods and truths] could be joined together. And a further reason why the expression 'forty-five' is used, and not 'if the fifty are lacking five', is that 'five' not only means that 
which is small, as shown in <a href="649.htm">649</a>, but also severance, as has also been shown in Volume One, in <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>. Consequently so that a joining together might be meant and not a severance, this number, that is to 
say, forty-five is used, for forty-five means some joining together, as stated above. Thus in a very beautiful way every detail follows in its particular sequence in the internal sense.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 
good and truth when joined together, this is an arcanum that cannot be described in such a way that the ordinary mind is able to grasp it. Let merely a brief explanation be given here. The more 
genuine and pure truth is, the better is good from the Lord able to be accommodated to it as the recipient vessel; but the less genuine and pure truth is, the less is good from the Lord able to be accommodated. 
For they must each answer to the other; and to the extent that they do, they are joined together. Goods cannot possibly be received into falsities, nor evils into truths as their recipient 
vessels, for they are by nature and disposition contrary. The one rejects the other as its very enemy; indeed if they tried to join together, each of them would throw up - good would throw up evil as 
though it were poison, and evil would throw up good as though it were something that induces vomiting. Such enmity between evil and good has been provided by the Lord to prevent the possibility of their 
being mixed together, for if they were so mixed a person would perish. Those who are deceivers and hypocrites come near to having the two joined together in them; yet even in their case the Lord takes 
care to prevent them becoming joined together. This is the reason why in the next life deceivers and hypocrites suffer more dreadfully than all others. </p>

`Et dixit, Non perdam, si invenero ibi quadraginta quinque': quod significet quod non periret si `conjungi possint, constat ex significatione numeri `quadraginta quinque' quod sit conjunctio; ostensum 
prius est quod numeri simplices significationem [suam] retineant etiam cum multiplicantur, et sic majores numeri similem ac minores; ita quoque `quadraginta quinque,' qui numerus per multiplicationem 
compositus est ex quinque in novem, et quia compositus est ex quinque in novem, significat idem ac quinque et novem {1}; quod `quinque' significent parum, n. 649 ostensum est, et quod `novem' conjunctionem 
seu conjunctum, n. 2075; ita hic si aliquantum bona sint conjuncta veris.  Quod numeri in Verbo significent res aut {2} status, constat ex illis quae supra n. 2252, de quinquaginta dicta sunt, 
(x)tum ex illis quae de numeris prius n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988 ostensa: [2] quia `quinque' significant parum, et `quadraginta quinque' conjunctionem, ipsa expositio numerorum 
istorum in hoc versu talis est; dicitur enim `forte defuerint quinquaginta justis quinque,' quo significatur si aliquid minus esset, et dein `num disperdes in quinque totam urbem?' quo significatur num 
pro parvo quod deest, peribunt? quia enim `quinque' significant parum, non assumuntur dein quinque, sed dicitur, `non perdam si invenero ibi quadraginta quinque,' quo significatur quod non perirent 
si conjungi possent; quod hic dicantur quadraginta quinque, et non `si desint quinque in quinquaginta' etiam causa est quia `quinque' non solum significant parum, ut ostensum n. 649, sed etiam disjunctionem, 
ut quoque ostensum in Parte Prima n. 1686, quare ne significaretur disjunctio sed conjunctio, hic numerus, nempe quadraginta quinque nominatur, nam `quadraginta quinque' est aliqua conjunctio, 
ut supra dictum; ita pulchre sequuntur singula in sua serie in sensu interno.  [3] Quod conjunctionem boni cum vero attinet, est arcanum quod non ita describi potest ut captu vulgari comprehendi queat; 
paucis modo dicendum; quo verum magis genuinum est et purum, eo bonum quod a Domino ei ut vasi recipienti melius inaptari potest, at quo verum minus genuinum et purum est, eo bonum a Domino minus 
(t)inaptari potest'; correspondebunt enim sibi mutuo; secundum correspondentiam fit conjunctio: bona nusquam possunt insinuari falsis, nec mala possunt veris ut vasis recipientibus, nam sunt contrariae 
indolis et naturae rejicit unum alterum, ut suum inimicum, immo si conarentur se conjungere, exspueret unum alterum, bonum nempe malum sicut venenum, et malum bonum sicut quoddam vomitale; talis inimicitia 
inter malum et bonum a Domino provisa est ne unquam commiscerentur, nam si commiscerentur, periret homo: in dolosis e hypocritis non procul ab est quin conjuncta sint, sed usque a Domino praecavetur 
ne conjungantur; quae causa est quod {3} dolosi et hypocritae {4} in altera vita prae omnibus aliis dira patiantur. 	@1 A has ac quinque et (deleted) ac novem.$ 	@2 et.$ 	@3 i qui.$ 	@4 i sunt.$ </p>
