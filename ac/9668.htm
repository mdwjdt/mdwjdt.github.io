<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9668节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9668.</strong>“要照着你在山上所看到的样式立起居所”表照所代表的天堂里的良善和源于它的真理之状态而朝向四个方位。这从“居所”和“照着你在山上所看到的样式”的含义清楚可知：“居所”是指天堂的一个代表（参看<a href="9594.htm">9594</a>节）；“照着你在山上所看到的样式”是指照天堂里的良善和源于它的真理之状态而朝向四个方位。这就是“立起居所所依照的样式”所表示的。“西乃山”，就是它出现的地方，是指天堂（参看<a href="9420.htm">9420</a>节）。从这段描述明显可知，纵向来看，居所从东到西，入口在东边，柜子在西边。因此，两面朝南、朝北。居所的东区代表良善上升的状态，西区代表良善下降的状态，南区代表真理住在光中的状态，北区代表真理住在阴暗中的状态。<br />入口朝向东区，是因为主通过爱之良善进入天堂，这也可见于以西结书中论述“新殿”的地方，那里有这些话：<br />他带我到一座朝东的门，看哪，以色列神的荣光从东路而来。耶和华的荣光从面朝东的门照入殿中。耶和华的荣光充满了殿。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.1.htm">43:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.6.htm">6</a>）<br />之后：<br />耶和华对我说，这朝东的门必须关闭，不可敞开，任何人都不可由其中进入，因为耶和华以色列的神已经由其中进入。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.1.htm">44:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.2.htm">2</a>）<br />从这些话很明显地看出，唯独主通过爱之良善进入天堂，来自主的爱之良善充满并构成天堂。“东”表示爱之良善方面的主，因为主是天堂的太阳（<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="7078.htm">7078</a>，<a href="7083.htm">7083</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>节）。但在天堂，情况是这样：东方是主显为太阳的地方，这太阳正对着右眼（<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>e，<a href="7078.htm">7078</a>，<a href="7171.htm">7171</a>节）。从那里向西，因而在东西一线上的，是那些处于爱之良善的人；不过，那些住在真理之光中的人朝南，而那些住在真理之阴中的人朝北。天堂里的所有人都仰望主，因为在那里向前看就是仰望主。在天堂，没有人能背对祂向后看，无论他怎样转动（参看<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>e节）。但这是一个属世人无法理解的奥秘。这些就是在山上指给摩西看、要照之立起居所的样式所代表的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9668</b></p><p><b>9668.</b>
And thou shalt set up the Habitation according to the method which thou wast made to see in the mountain. That this signifies toward the quarters, according to the states of good and of the derivative 
truth in the heaven which is represented, is evident from the signification of "the Habitation," as being a representative of heaven (see n. 9594); from the signification of "according to the method 
which thou wast made to see in the mountain," as being toward the quarters, according to the states of good and of the derivative truth in heaven; for this is meant by "the method according to which 
the Habitation was to be set up." (That "Mount Sinai," where it was seen, denotes heaven, see n. 9420.) From the description it is evident that as regards its length the Habitation was placed from east 
to west, and that the entrance was toward the east, and the ark toward the west; consequently the sides were toward the south and the north. The eastern quarter of the Habitation represented the state 
of good in its rising; the western quarter the state of good in its going down; the southern quarter the state of truth in its light; and the northern quarter the state of truth in its shade. [2] 
The entrance was toward the eastern quarter for the reason that the Lord enters into heaven through the good of love, as can also be seen in Ezekiel, where the "new temple" is treated of, and where are 
these words: </p>
<p>     He led me to the gate that looketh toward the east, when behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. And the glory of Jehovah entered into the house by the 
way of the gate whose face is toward the east, and the glory of Jehovah filled the house (Ezek. 43:1-6).      Jehovah said unto me, This gate that looketh toward the east shall be shut, it shall not 
be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; but Jehovah the God of Israel shall enter in by it (Ezek. 44:1, 2); </p>
<p>from which it is very evident that the Lord alone enters into heaven through the good 
of love, and that the good of love from the Lord fills heaven and makes it. "The east" signifies the Lord as to the good of love, for the reason that the Lord is the Sun of heaven (n. 3636, 3643, 7078, 
7083, 7270). But in heaven the case is this. The east is where the Lord appears as the Sun, which is in front over against the right eye (n. 4321, 7078, 7171); toward the west from it, and thus in 
a straight line from the east to the west, are those who are in the good of love; but toward the south are those who are in the light of truth, and toward the north are those who are in the shade of truth. 
All who are in heaven look toward the Lord, for looking forward there is looking to Him. No one in heaven can look backward from Him, however he may turn himself (see n. 4321). But this is a secret 
which the natural man cannot comprehend. Such are the things represented by the method shown to Moses in the mountain, in accordance with which the Habitation was to be set up. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9668</b></p><p><b>9668.</b>
'And you shall set up the dwelling-place according to the plan which you saw on the mountain' means in the four quarters, according to the states of good and of the truth springing from it in the heaven 
that is represented. This is clear from the meaning of 'the dwelling-place' as a representative of heaven, dealt with in <a href="9594.htm">9594</a>; and from the meaning of 'according to the plan which you saw on the mountain' 
as to the four quarters according to the states of good and of the truth springing from it in heaven. This is what 'the plan according to which the dwelling-place was to be set up' serves to 
mean, Mount Sinai where it was seen being heaven, see <a href="9420.htm">9420</a>. From the description that is given it is evident that the dwelling-place was positioned lengthways from east to west, and that the entrance 
was at the east end and the ark at the west. The sides therefore were to the south and to the north. The eastern quarter of the dwelling-place represented the state of good on the rise, the western quarter 
the state of good on the decline, the southern quarter the state of truth dwelling in light, and the northern quarter the state of truth dwelling in shade.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The entrance was towards the eastern 
quarter because the Lord enters heaven by way of the good of love, as also becomes clear in Ezekiel, where the new temple is the subject and the following words occur,  </p>
<blockquote>
He brought me to the 
gate which was facing towards the east, and behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. And the glory of Jehovah entered the house by the way of the gate, the face of which is 
towards the east; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2043:1-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 43:1-6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And after this,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to me, The gate facing east shall be shut and not opened, and no man (vir) shall enter 
by it; but Jehovah, the God of Israel, will enter by it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2044:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 44:1, 2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is plainly evident that the Lord alone enters heaven by way of the good of love, and that the good of love 
from the Lord fills heaven and composes it. 'The east' means the Lord in respect of the good of love because the Lord is the Sun of heaven, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="7078.htm">7078</a>, <a href="7083.htm">7083</a>, <a href="7171.htm">7171</a>, <a href="8644.htm">8644</a>, <a href="8812.htm">8812</a>. But in heaven 
things are positioned in such a way that the east is where the Lord appears as the Sun, straight before the right eye, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a> (end), <a href="7078.htm">7078</a>, <a href="7171.htm">7171</a>. From there towards the west, thus in a direct line from the 
east and towards the west, are those with whom the good of love is present; but to the south are those dwelling in the light of truth, and to the north those in the shade of truth. All who are in heaven 
look towards the Lord, for to look frontwards there is to look towards Him. No one there can look backwards away from Him, no matter how far they turn themselves about, see <a href="4321.htm">4321</a> (end). But this 
is an arcanum which the natural man cannot take in. These are the kinds of things that were represented by the plan seen by Moses on the mountain, according to which the dwelling-place was to be set up.  </p>

`Et statues habitaculum secundum modum quem videre factus es in monte': quod significet ad plagas secundum status boni et inde veri in caelo quod repraesentatur, constat ex significatione `habitaculi' 
quod sit repraesentativum caeli, de qua n. 9594; ex significatione `secundum modum quem videre factus es in monte' quod sit ad plagas secundum status boni et inde veri in caelo, nam illud per modum, 
secundum quem statueretur habitaculum, intelligitur; quod mons Sinai, ubi visum (o)est, sit caelum, videatur n. 9420. (m)Ex descriptione {1} patet quod habitaculum positum fuerit quoad longitudinem 
ab oriente (o)ad occidentem, et quod ad orientem esset introitus, ad {2} occidentem arca; inde latera erant {3} ad meridiem et (o)ad septentrionem {4}; plaga orientalis habitaculi repraesentabat statum 
boni in suo ortu, {5} plaga occidentalis statum boni in suo occasu, plaga meridionalis {6} statum veri in sua luce, et plaga septentrionalis statum veri in sua umbra. 	[2] Introitus erat ad plagam 
orientalem, ex causa quia Dominus intrat {7} per bonum amoris in caelum; quod etiam constare potest apud Ezechielem, ubi agitur de novo templo, ubi haec,      	Duxit me ad portam quae spectans versus 
orientem, cum ecce gloria Dei Israel {8} venit a via orientis; et gloria Jehovae intravit in domum via portae, cujus facies versus orientem, et implevit gloria Jehovae domum, xliii 1-6: </p>
<p>et dein,   
   	Dixit ad me Jehovah, (x)Porta spectans orientem clausa erit, non aperietur, et vir non intrabit per eam, sed Jehovah Deus Israel intrabit per eam, xliv 1, 2; </p>
<p>ex quibus manifeste patet quod Dominus 
solus intret in caelum per bonum amoris, et quod bonum amoris a Domino impleat caelum et faciat illud; `oriens' significat Dominum {9} quoad bonum amoris, ex causa quia Dominus est Sol caeli, n. 3636, 
3643, 7078, 7083, (x)7171, 8644, 8812.  In caelo autem ita se habet: oriens est ubi Dominus apparet ut Sol, quod est antrorsum e regione oculi dextri, n. 4321 fin., 7078, 7171, versus occidentem inde, 
ita in linea recta ab oriente et ad occidentem {10} sunt qui in bono amoris; ad austrum (o)autem sunt qui in luce veri, et ad septentrionem qui in umbra veri.  Omnes qui in caelo spectant ad Dominum, 
nam ibi antrorsum spectare est ad Ipsum; nemo ibi potest retro ab Ipso spectare (m)utcumque se vertit, videatur n. 4321 fin., sed hoc arcanum est quod naturalis homo non potest comprehendere {11}.(n)
