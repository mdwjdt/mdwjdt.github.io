<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4987.</strong>“且这些事发生以后”表第三个状态。这从“发生”或“因此”（so it was）和“这些事”的含义清楚可知：“发生以后”或“因此”暗示某种新事物（参看<a href="4979.htm">4979</a>节），因而在此是指第三个状态；“这些事以后”是指这些事完成后。在原语言和在其它语言一样，一个思路并未通过标点符号与另一个思路分开；但这段经文可以说从头贯穿到尾，当中没有任何间断。内义中的观念同样以没有间断的方式连续出现，从事物的一个状态流入它的另一个状态。但当一个状态终结，另一个主要状态取而代之时，经上就用“于是”或“这事以后”暗示这一点，而次要的状态变化则用“且或和”（and）这个词来暗示。这就是为何这些词经常出现的原因。现在所论述的这第三个状态比之前的状态更内在。</p>

And it came to pass after these words. That this signifies a third state, is evident from the signification of "it came to pass," or "it was," as involving something new (see n. 4979), here consequently 
a third state; and from the signification of "after these words," as being after these things were transacted. In the original language one series is not distinguished from another by intervening 
marks, as in other languages; but the text appears to be as it were continuous from beginning to end. The things in the internal sense are also in like manner continuous and flowing from one state of 
a thing into another; but when one state terminates, and another of importance succeeds, this is indicated by "it was" or "it came to pass;" and a change of state less important by "and." This is the 
reason why these expressions so frequently occur. This state, which is the third, and which is now treated of, is more interior than the former. </p>

'And it happened after these events' means a third state. This is clear from the meaning of 'it happened' or 'so it was' as that which implies something new, as above in <a href="4979.htm">4979</a>, and therefore at this point 
a third state; and from the meaning of 'after these events' as after those things were completed. In the original language one line of thought is not separated from another by punctuation marks,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
as in other languages, but the text seems to run so to speak from start to finish without any breaks in it. Ideas in the internal sense follow one another in a similar way without breaks, moving on from 
one state of a thing into another state of it. But when one state comes to an end and another major one takes its place, this is indicated by the expression 'so it was' or 'it happened', while a minor 
change of state is indicated by the word 'and'. This is the reason why these expressions occur so frequently. This third state described now is more internal than the previous one.

`Et factum post verba haec':  quod significet tertium, statum constat ex significatione `factum' {1}vel fuit quod involvat novum quid, {2}ut supra n. 4979, proinde hic statum tertium; et ex significatione 
`post verba haec' quod sit post illas res transactas.  In lingua originali non distinguitur una series ab altera per signo interstitialia ut in aliis linguis, sed apparet sicut continuum 
a principio ad finem: illa quae in sensu interno quidem similiter continua sunt, et fluentia ab uno statu rei in alterum, at cum unus status terminatur et alter succedit qui insignis est, indicatur 
per `fuit' vel `factum'; et mutatio status minus insignis per `et', quapropter illa tam frequenter occurrunt. Hic status qui tertius est, de quo nunc agitur, est priori interior. @1 seu$  @2 de qua$  </p>
