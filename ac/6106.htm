<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6106节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6106.</strong>“约瑟用食物供养他父亲和他弟兄，并他父亲全家”表有一个进入属灵良善和属世层中教会真理的良善的持续流注从内在属天层而来，该流注赋予它们生命。这从“用食物供养”和“他父亲全家”的含义，以及“约瑟”、以色列和他儿子们的代表清楚可知：“用食物供养”是指良善的流注，因为“供养”在此表示一种持续的流注，该流注赋予人属灵生命，而“食物”是指爱之良善（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节）；“约瑟”是指内在属天层（<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）；以色列，即此处的“父亲”，是指来自属世层的属灵良善；他的儿子们，即此处的“弟兄”是指属世层中的教会真理，如前所述（<a href="6102.htm">6102</a>节）；“他父亲全家”是指整体上属于属灵良善并源自该良善的一切。由此明显可知，“约瑟用食物供养他父亲和他弟兄，并他父亲全家”表示来自内在属天层的爱之良善的持续流注进入属灵良善和属世层中教会的真理，还进入属于属灵良善并源自该良善的一切事物。</p>

And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread. That this signifies that from the internal celestial there was a continuous influx of good into spiritual good 
and the truths of the church in the natural, whence was their life, is evident from the signification of "sustaining with bread," as being the influx of good; for "to sustain" here denotes to continually 
flow in, whence man has spiritual life, and "bread" is the good of love (see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915); from the representation of Joseph, as 
being the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877); from the representation of Israel, who is here the "father," as being spiritual good from the natural; from the representation of his sons, who are here 
the "brethren," as being the truths of the church in the natural (of which above, n. 6102); and from the signification of "all his father's house," as being all in one complex that is of spiritual good 
and from this good. Hence it is plain that by "Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread," is signified the continuous influx of the good of love from the 
internal celestial into spiritual good and the truths of the church in the natural, and into all things that are of spiritual good and from it. </p>

'And Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household with bread' means that from the internal celestial there was a constant influx of good into spiritual good and the Church's 
truths in the natural, which gave them their life. This is clear from the meaning of 'sustaining with bread' as an influx of good, for 'sustaining' here is a constant inflowing, which gives a 
person spiritual life, while 'bread' is the good of love, <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>; from the representation of 'Joseph' as the internal celestial, dealt 
with in <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>; from the representation of Israel, to whom 'father' refers here, as spiritual good from the natural, and from the representation of his sons, to whom 'brothers' refers here, as 
the Church's truths in the natural, both dealt with in <a href="6101.htm">6101</a>; and from the meaning of 'all his father's household' as everything in its entirety which belongs to spiritual good and is derived from that 
good. From all this it is evident that 'Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household with bread' means that there was a constant influx of the good of love from the internal 
celestial into spiritual good and the Church's truths in the natural, and into everything belonging to spiritual good and derived from it. </p>

`Et sustentavit Joseph patrem suum, et fratres suos, et totam domum patris sui, pane': quod significet quod a caelesti interno continuus influxus boni in bonum spirituale et vera Ecclesiae in naturali, 
unde vita illorum, constat a significatione `sustentare pane quod sit influxus boni; `sustentare' enim hic est continue influere, unde vita spiritualis homini; et `panis' est bonum amoris, n. 276, 
680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915; ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste internum, de qua n. 5869, 5877; ex repraesentatione `Israelis' qui hic est `pater', 
quod sit bonum spirituale ex naturali; ex repraesentatione `filiorum ejus' qui hic sunt `fratres', quod sint vera Ecclesiae in naturali, de quibus supra n. 6102; et ex significatione `totius domus 
patris sui' quod sit in uno complexu omne quod est boni spiritualis et ex bono illo; inde  patet quod per `sustentavit Joseph patrem suum, et fratres suos, et totam domum patris sui, pane' significetur 
continuus influxus boni amoris a caelesti interno in bonum spirituale et vera Ecclesiae in naturali, et in omnia quae sunt boni spiritualis et ex illo. </p>
