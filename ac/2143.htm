<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2143节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2143.</strong>“耶和华向亚伯拉罕显现”表主的直觉。这从以下事实清楚可知，即圣言中的历史事件是代表，并非别的东西，其中的话语用来表示出现在内义中的事物。就此处经文的内义而言，所论述的主题是主及其直觉，这种直觉由耶和华向亚伯拉罕显现来代表。圣言历史部分所记载的每次显现、每句话和每个行为都具有这样的代表性质。但是，只有将这些历史仅仅当作载体来关注，如那些可见物体那样，通过它们有机会和能力去思想更高尚的事物，它们所代表的东西才会显现出来。以花园为例，当看到它们时，我们会思想果实和它们的用处，以及这些东西所赋予的生命快乐，更高尚一点，则会想到乐园或天堂的幸福。当思想这类事物时，诚然，我们会看到花园中的具体事物，但对它们兴致缺缺，以至于不关注它们。这和圣言中历史的情形非常相似，因为当思想处于这些历史内义中的属天和属灵之物时，这些历史，连同这些话本身几乎不为人所关注。</p>

Jehovah appeared unto him. That this signifies the Lord's perception, may be seen from the fact that the historicals of the Word are merely representative, and the words therein significative, of those 
things which are in the internal sense. In the internal sense of the passage before us the subject treated of is the Lord and His perception, which perception was represented by the appearing to Abraham 
of Jehovah; for such is the representative nature in the historicals of the Word of every appearing, of every discourse, and of every deed. But what they represent does not appear unless the historicals 
are attended to simply as objects, like those of sight, from which there is given the occasion and the opportunity for thinking about things more lofty; for instance, from gardens, as we behold 
them, for thinking about fruits, their uses, and also the derivative delight of life, and, still more loftily, about paradisal or heavenly happiness. When such things are thought of, the several objects 
of the garden are indeed seen, but so slightly that they are not attended to. The case is the very same with the historicals of the Word, for when the celestial and spiritual things that are in 
the internal sense of these historicals are thought of, these, together with the words themselves, are attended to just as little. </p>

'Jehovah appeared to him' means the Lord's perception. This becomes clear from the fact that historical events as described in the Word are representative, and nothing else, and the actual words used 
there serve to mean the things that occur in the internal sense. Featured at this point in the internal sense are the Lord and His perception; and that perception was represented by the event of Jehovah's 
appearing to Abraham. Every appearance, every utterance, and every deed recorded in the historical sections of the Word is in this manner representative. But what each represents becomes apparent 
only if attention is paid to historical descriptions solely as objects - as when objects of sight serve solely to give one an opportunity and the ability to think about more sublime things, as for example 
when people look at gardens and yet think solely of fruits and their uses, and also of the delight of life given by these, and think still more sublimely of the happiness of paradise, or heaven. 
When their thoughts are on those things they do, it is true, behold the particular objects in the gardens, yet with so little interest in them as mere objects that they pay no attention to them. It 
is similar with the historical descriptions in the Word. When people's thoughts are on the celestial and spiritual things contained in the internal sense, just as little attention is paid to the historical 
events described or to the words themselves used to describe them. </p>

`Apparuit illi Jehovah': quod significet perceptionem Domini, constare potest ex eo quod historica Verbi non sint nisi repraesentativa et verba ibi significativa illarum rerum quae in sensu interno; 
hic agitur in sensu interno de Domino ac de Ipsius perceptione, quae repraesentata fuit per quod `apparuerit Jehovah Abrahamo'; omnis apparitio, omnis sermo et omne factum in historicis Verbi, talia 
sunt; quid (o)vero repraesentant, non patet nisi historica non attendantur aliter ac objecta, sicut quae visus, ex quibus datur ansa aut {1} copia cogitandi de rebus sublimioribus, pro exemplo ex hortis 
dum videntur, de fructibus, horum usibus, tum de jucunditate vitae ex illis, et adhuc sublimius, de felicitate paradisiaca, seu caelesti; quae cum cogitantur, objecta singula hortulana quidem videntur, 
sed ita leviter ut non attendantur: ita quoque se habet cum historicis Verbi, in quibus cum caelestia et spiritualia quae in interno sensu sunt, cogitantur, tunc historica et ipsa verba non aliter 
attenduntur. 	@1 et.$ </p>
