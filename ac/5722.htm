<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5722节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5722.</strong>还有些灵人活在肉身时是最为污秽的，他们的污秽简直难以启齿。他们通过自己的在场并流入身体的实体部位而引入一种生活的疲倦感，并使得身体部位和四肢如此懒散，以致此人无法下床。他们极其顽固，最难管教，不像其他魔鬼那样能通过惩罚被吓阻。他们出现在人的头部旁边，好像躺在那里。当驱赶他们时，不是突然，而是慢慢地驱赶；那时，他们逐渐向更低的地方滚下去；当抵达深渊时，他们在那里所受的折磨如此严厉，以致他们不得不停止缠磨别人。他们作恶的快乐甚大，再没有比这更令他们快乐的了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5722</b></p><p><b>5722.</b>
There are others who in the life of the body have been most filthy, their filthiness being such as to be unmentionable. By their presence and influx into the solid parts of the body they induce a weariness 
of life, and such torpor in the members and limbs that the man cannot rise from his bed. They are very stubborn, and do not desist through penalties, as do other devils. They appear beside the 
head, and as if lying there. When they are driven away, it is not done suddenly, but gently, and they are then by degrees rolled down toward lower places; and when they come into the deep, they are tormented 
there so severely that they cannot but desist from infesting others. Such is their delight in doing evil that nothing is more delightful to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5722</b></p><p><b>5722.</b>
There are others who during their lifetime were utterly foul; that foulness was such that it must be passed over in silence here. By their presence and influx into the solid parts of the body they introduce 
a fatigued feeling of weariness with life and such sluggishness in one's members and limbs that one cannot get out of bed. They are most ungovernable; they are not deterred by punishments the 
way other devils are. They appear next to one's head, where they seem to be lying down. When they are driven away this is not achieved all of a sudden but slowly; they are rolled away gradually into the 
nether regions. When they reach a position deep down they suffer such great torment there that they are compelled to desist from plaguing others. So great is their delight in doing evil that nothing 
gives them greater delight. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5722</b>
</p><b>5722.</b>
Sunt alii qui in vita corporis spurcissimi fuerunt; spurcities eorum talis est ut reticenda; illi per praesentiam suam et influxum in partes solidas corporis, inducunt taedium vitae, {1}et talem torporem 
membris et artubus ut se levare `homo' e lecto non possit.  Contumacissimi sunt, {2]non {3}desistunt per poenas ut alii diaboli; apparent juxta caput et ibi sicut jacentes; cum abiguntur, non fit 
subito sed lente, et tunc per gradus versus inferiora devolvuntur; et cum in profundum {4}veniunt, ibi in tantum cruciantur ut non possint non desistere ab infestandis aliis.  Tale est eorum jucundum 
malum faciendi ut nihil jucundius. @1 ut I $ @2 nec$ @3 after diaboli$ @4 venerunt$ </p>
