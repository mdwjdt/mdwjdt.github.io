<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>431.</strong>“伤”与“损”表不健全的状态；“伤”表信被荒凉，“损”表仁被荒废，这一点从以下事实明显可知，即“伤”的是“男人”，“损”的是小孩子。以赛亚书用了同样的术语，即信的荒凉与仁的荒废：<br />从脚掌到头顶，没有一处完全的，尽是创伤、癒损，与新打的伤痕，都没有收口，没有缠裹，也没有用膏滋润。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.6.htm">1:6</a>）<br />这里的“创伤”涉及被荒凉的信，“癒损”涉及被荒废的仁，“伤痕”涉及这二者。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]431.</strong> The wound and the bruise mean the fact that nothing was sound any longer, the wound specifically meaning that faith had been abandoned and the bruise meaning that charity had been wiped out. This can be seen from the fact that the man is associated with the wound and the child with the bruise. Isaiah uses the same words to depict the abandonment of faith and destruction of charity:<br />From the sole of the foot right to the head, there is no soundness in it; wound, bruise, and fresh blow, not pressed out and not bandaged and not softened with oil. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_431/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_1_6" target=_top>Isaiah 1:6</a>)<br />The wound is used for faith abandoned, the bruise for charity wiped out, and the blow for both. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 431</b></p><p><b>431.</b>
That by a "wound" and a "bruise" is signified that there was soundness no longer, by a "wound" that faith was desolated, and by a "bruise" that charity was devastated, is evident from the fact that "wound" 
is predicated of a "man" and "bruise" of a "little one." The desolation of faith and the vastation of charity are described in the same terms in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     From the sole of the foot even unto 
the head there is no soundness in it; but wound and bruise and a fresh sore they have not been pressed out, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil (Isa. 1:6). In this passage "wound" is predicated 
of faith desolated, "bruise" of charity devastated, and "sore" of both. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 431</b></p><p><b>431.</b>
'Wound' and 'bruise' mean a condition that was no longer sound, 'wound' in particular meaning 'bruise' charity that had been laid waste. This is clear from the fact that wound has reference to 'a man' 
and bruise to 'a little one'. The same words are used in Isaiah to describe the desolation of faith and the laying waste of charity,  </p>
<blockquote>
From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness 
in it, but a wound, bruising, and running sores. They are not pressed out, nor bound up, nor softened with oil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%201:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 1:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'wound' has reference to faith which had been desolated, 'bruise' 
to charity that had been laid waste, and 'sores' to both.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 431</b>
</p><b>431.</b>
Quod per 'vulnus et livorem' significetur quod non integrum magis, per 'vulnus' in specie quod desolata fides, per 'livorem' quod devastata charitas, constat ex eo quod vulnus praedicetur de viro et 
livor de parvulo; per easdem voces describitur desolatio fidei et vastatio charitatis, per Esaiam, 	A planta pedis usque ad caput non in eo integritas, vulnus: livor, et plaga recens, non expressa, 
et non obligata, et non mollita oleo, i 6; </p>
<p>ubi 'vulnus' praedicatur de desolata fide, 'livor' de vastata charitate 'plaga' de utraque. </p>
