On that very day Noah entered the ark, as did Shem and Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, and Noah's wife and his sons' three wives with them.<br />They entered the ark here as before means that they were saved. Noah symbolizes qualities of the church. Shem, Ham, and Japheth symbolize qualities of the churches that developed out of that church. Noah's sons symbolize doctrinal teachings. Noah's wife symbolizes the actual church. His sons' three wives symbolize the actual churches that developed out of that church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 764</b></p><p><b>764.</b>
Verse 13. In the self-same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark. That they "entered into the ark" 
signifies here as before that they were saved; "Noah" signifies what was of the church; "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" what was of the churches that were thence derived; "the sons of Noah" signify doctrinal 
things; "the three wives of his sons with them" signify the churches themselves that were thence derived. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 764</b></p><p><b>764.</b>
Verse 13 On that very day Noah went in, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, [and Noah's wife,] and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark. </p>
<p>'They went into the ark' means here, 
as previously, that they were saved. 'Noah' means what belonged to that Church. 'Shem, Ham, and Japheth' means what belonged to the Churches that derived from it. 'The sons of Noah' means matters of doctrine. 
['Noah's wife means the Church itself.] 'The three wives of his sons with them' means the derivative Churches themselves. </p>

Vers. 13.  In ipso die hoc intravit Noah, et Shem, et Ham, et Japheth, filii Noahi, [et uxor Noahi,] {1} et tres uxores filiorum ejus cum illis, in arcam. Per 'quod intrarint {2} in arcam' significatur 
hic ut prius, quod servati: per 'Noahum' quod fuit Ecclesiae: per 'Shem, Ham et Japheth' quod fuit Ecclesiarum inde: per 'filios Noahi,' doctrinalia: [per 'uxorem Noahi' ipsa Ecclesia:] per 'tres uxores 
filiorum ejus cum illis' ipsae Ecclesiae inde. 	@1 Though missing here and later in this [ ] these words are included in n. 765, 770.$ 	@2 intrarent I.$ </p>
