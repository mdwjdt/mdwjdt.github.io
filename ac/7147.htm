<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7147节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7147.</strong>“其实是你的百姓犯了罪”表因此，他们作了恶，是有罪的。这从“犯了罪”的含义清楚可知，“犯了罪”是指因邪恶而有罪，若有罪，他们就要接受应有的惩罚。必须阐述一下包含在本节和此前几节中的事大体是什么情况。那些在低地的人从周围地狱所引入的虚假和邪恶侵扰，以便除去邪恶和虚假，灌输真理和良善，他们以这种方式被带入他们能被提入天堂的状态（参看<a href="7090.htm">7090</a>，<a href="7122.htm">7122</a>节）。但接近尾生的时候，他们所受的侵扰比以往任何时候都要严厉；因为那时，真理从他们那里被夺走，只有虚假被允许侵扰他们，直到他们陷入绝望。事实上，按照神序，侵扰和试探的最后阶段是绝望（参看<a href="1787.htm">1787</a>，<a href="2694.htm">2694</a>，<a href="5279.htm">5279</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>节）。法老这样做，是为了以色列人能代表那些属于属灵教会的人所经历的这种状态。当侵扰接近尾生时，也就是说，当以色列人即将被释放，并被领进迦南地时，法老就如此行。<br />要知道，侵扰以这种方式实现：来自地狱的虚假和邪恶被引入人的思维，来自天堂，也就是经由天堂来自主的真理和良善也被引入人的思维；这种引入之所以发生在他里面，是因为世人或灵人没有源于自己的任何思维；相反，一切都是从外面流入的。这一点虽与我们的感觉完全相反，因此似乎让人难以置信，却绝对是真的。关于这个问题，可参看前面通过经历所作的阐述和说明（<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>，<a href="4151.htm">4151</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="5846.htm">5846</a>，<a href="5854.htm">5854</a>，<a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>，<a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6327.htm">6327</a>，<a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>节）。由此可知要如何理解这一观念，即：侵扰通过引入虚假实现，并且会增加，直到人陷入绝望。</p>

And thy people have sinned. That this signifies that thus they are guilty in that they have done evil, is evident from the signification of "sinning," as being to become guilty of evil, and in this case 
that they would deserve to be punished. How the case is in general with what is contained in this and the preceding verse must be told. They who are in the lower earth are infested by falsities and 
evils injected from the hells round about, in order that evils and falsities may be removed, and truths and goods be instilled, and that in this way they may be brought into a state in which they can 
be raised up into heaven (see n. 7090, 7122). But near the end they are more severely infested than before; for then truths are taken from them, and mere falsities are permitted to infest them, and 
this even to despair; for it is of Divine order that the last of infestation and of temptation should be despair (see n. 1787, 2694, 5279, 5280). This was done by Pharaoh in order that this state of those 
who are of the spiritual church might be represented by the sons of Israel, and this when the infestations were near to the end, that is, when the people were to be liberated and conducted into the 
land of Canaan. Be it known that infestations are effected in this manner, namely, that falsities and evils from the hells are injected into the thoughts, and also truths and goods from heaven, that 
is, through heaven from the Lord; this is done because a man and a spirit do not think from themselves, but all things flow in, which although it is quite foreign to our feeling, and therefore seems 
to be incredible, is nevertheless most true (on this matter see what has already been adduced and shown from experience, n. 2886, 4151, 4249, 5846, 5854, 6189-6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6598-6626). 
From all this it can be known how it is to be understood that infestations are effected by means of the injection of falsities, and that this is increased even to despair. </p>

'And your people have sinned' means that for this reason they are guilty of having done what is evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'sinning' as becoming guilty of evil; and, if guilty, as receiving 
deserved punishment. What the situation is in general regarding the matters contained in this verse and in those that come before it must be stated. Those who are on the lower earth are molested by 
the falsities and evils introduced by the surrounding hells. Such molestation takes place in order that evils and falsities may be removed and truths and forms of good may be instilled, as a result 
of which they are brought into a state in which they can be raised to heaven, see <a href="7090.htm">7090</a>, <a href="7122.htm">7122</a>. But near the end they are molested more harshly than ever before, for at that stage truths are taken away 
from them and utter falsities are allowed to molest them, even until they are made to despair. For it is in accordance with Divine order that despair should be the final stage of molestation and temptation, 
see <a href="1787.htm">1787</a>, <a href="2694.htm">2694</a>, <a href="5279.htm">5279</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>. In order that this state experienced by those belonging to the spiritual Church might be represented by the children of Israel, Pharaoh acted as the narrative describes 
here. He did what he did when the molestations were near the end, that is to say, when the children of Israel were about to be set free and led to the land of Canaan. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized 
that molestations take place in the following way: Falsities and evils are introduced into a person's thoughts by the hells, and truths and forms of good by heaven, that is, by the Lord through heaven; 
and that introduction takes place in him because no man or spirit has any thought that originates in himself. Rather, everything flows in from without. Although this is entirely contrary to anyone's 
perception of what is going on inside him and for that reason seems impossible to believe, it is nevertheless absolutely true. See what has already been brought forward and shown from experience on 
the matter in <a href="2886.htm">2886</a>, <a href="4151.htm">4151</a>, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>, <a href="5846.htm">5846</a>, <a href="5854.htm">5854</a>, <a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>, <a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6327.htm">6327</a>, <a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>, <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>. From these places one may know how to understand the idea that molestations are effected by the introduction of 
falsities, and are increased until a person is made to despair.  </p>

`Et peccavit populus tuus':  quod significet quod sic illis reatus quod malum fecerint, constat ex significatione `peccare' quod sit reus mali fieri, et si hoc, quod ex merito lucrent poenam. Quomodo 
haec quae in hoc versu et in praecedentibus in genere se habent, dicendum: qui in inferiore terra sunt a falsis et malis injectis ab infernis quae circumcirca infestantur, ob causam ut mala et falsa 
removeantur et vera ac bona insinuentur, et sic in statum perducantur ut elevari in caelum possint, videatur n. 7090, 7122; sed prope ad finem durius infestantur quam prius, nam tunc vera illis subtrahuntur, 
et permittitur ut mera falsa infestent, et hoc usque ad desperationem; ex ordine enim Divino est ut ultimum infestationis et tentationis sit desperatio, videatur n. 1787, 2694, 5279, 5280; ut 
hic status illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali per filios Israelis repraesentaretur, factum hoc est a Pharaone, et hoc cum infestationes prope ad finem essent, cum nempe liberarentur, et ducerentur {1}in 
terram Canaanem. 	2 Sciendum est quod infestationes fiant eo modo, quod in cogitationes (t)injiciantur falsa et mala ab infernis, et quod vera et bona a caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino; {2} quod 
fit quia homo et spiritus non {3}cogitant a se, sed influunt omnia; hoc tametsi prorsus alienum a sensu, et sic incredibile apparet, usque tamen est verissimum; de hac re videantur quae prius ab experientia, 
n. 2886, 4151, 4249, 5846, 5854, 6189-6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6598-6626, allata et ostensa sunt.  Ex his potest sciri quomodo {4}intelligendum quod infestationes fiant per injectiones 
falsorum et quod augeantur {5} usque ad desperationem. 	@1 d ad terram i versus$ 	@2 i et sic$ 	@3 cogitat ex se, nec aliquid velit ex se, sed quod influant omnia quae cogitat et quae vult$ 	@4 se
