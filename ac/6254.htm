<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6254节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6254.</strong>“我要给他们祝福”表关于良善与真理的预言。这从“祝福”的含义清楚可知，“祝福”是指预言（参看<a href="6230.htm">6230</a>节），在此是指关于“玛拿西和以法莲”所代表的良善与真理的预言。“祝福”是一个很常见的词语，故具有各种含义；它也表示预言，既表示关于即将发生的好事的预言，也表示关于祸事的预言；这一点明显可见于下一章，在该章，以色列向他的儿子们预言了将要临到他们身上的事，有些儿子会面临祸事，如流便、西缅和利未；有些儿子则面临好事，如犹大和约瑟。这种预言在这一章的28节经文中被称为一种“福分”：这也是他们的父亲对他们所说的话，为他们所祝的福，都是按着各人的福分，为他们祝福。“祝福”表示预言，这一点从该章第一节经文明显看出来：雅各叫了他的儿子们来说，你们要聚在一起，我好把你们末后之日必遇的事告诉你们。</p>

And I will bless them. That this signifies a prediction about good and truth, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being prediction (see above, n. 6230), here about good and truth, which 
are represented by Manasseh and Ephraim. As "to bless" is a very general expression, it signifies various things; that it signifies also a prediction, both about the good things that will happen, and 
about the evil, is plain in the following chapter, where Israel foretold to his sons what should befall them; to some, evil things, as to Reuben, Simeon, and Levi; and to some, good things, as to Judah 
and Joseph. This prediction is called a "blessing" in verse 28 of this chapter: "This is what their father spake of them, and blessed them, everyone according to his blessing he blessed them." That 
"blessing" denotes prediction, is evident from the words in the first verse of the chapter: "Jacob called his sons, and said, Be ye gathered together, and I will tell you what shall happen to you in 
the extremity of the days." </p>

'And I will bless them' means a foretelling regarding goodness and truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'blessing' as foretelling, as above in <a href="6230.htm">6230</a>, here a foretelling regarding goodness and truth, 
which are represented by 'Manasseh and Ephraim'. Being a very common word 'blessing' has various meanings. Included among them is the foretelling both of good things that are going to happen and also 
of bad ones, as is evident in the next chapter in which Israel foretold to his sons what was going to happen to them - bad things to some, such as Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, good ones to others, such 
as Judah and Joseph. That foretelling is called a blessing in verse 28 of that chapter,  </p>
<p>This is what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them, each according to his blessing he blessed them. </p>
<p>It 
is also clear from the words contained in the first verse of the chapter that 'blessing' means a foretelling, </p>
<p>Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather together, and I will tell you what will 
happen to you at the end of days. </p>

`Et benedicam illis': quod significet praedictionem de bono et vero, constat ex significatione `benedicere' quod sit praedictio, ut supra n. 6230, hic de bono et vero quae per `Menashen et {1}Ephraimum' 
repraesentantur.  Benedicere quia est vox communissima {2}, ita significat {3} varia; quod etiam praedictionem tam de bonis quae contingent quam de malis, patet in sequente capite ubi Israel praedixit 
filiis suis quid illis eveniret, quibusdam mala, ut Reubeni, Shimeoni et Levi, et quibusdam bona, ut Jehudae et Josepho; praedictio illa dicitur `benedictio' in versu 28 ibi, Hoc quod locutus illis 
pater illorum, et benedixit illis, cuique, quod secundum benedictionem ejus benedixit illis; quod `benedictio' sit praedictio {4}, constat a verbis in versu primo illius capitis, Vocavit Jacob filios 
suos, et dixit, Collegimini, et indicabo vobis quid continget vobis in extremitate dierum. @1 Benjaminem$ @2 i includens omne bonum et verum$ @3 significans$ @4 i ibi$ </p>
