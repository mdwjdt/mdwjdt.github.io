<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7270节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7270.</strong>“凡我所吩咐你的，你都要说”，“你的哥哥亚伦要对法老说”表对神性流注的接受，以及传达。这从“摩西”和“亚伦”的代表，以及“说”和“吩咐”的含义清楚可知：要说的“摩西”是指神性真理；“亚伦”是指源于它的教义（参看<a href="7089.htm">7089</a>节）；“说”是指流注和对它的接受（参看<a href="5797.htm">5797</a>节）；“吩咐”也是指流注（<a href="5486.htm">5486</a>，<a href="5732.htm">5732</a>节），在此是指对流注的接受。由此明显可知，“说”表示神性真理进入教义，也就是进入进行教导的人那里的间接流注，因为意思是说，代表神性真理的摩西要对代表教义，或进行教导之人的亚伦说耶和华所吩咐的话，因而要对那要传达它的人说；“吩咐”表示进入“摩西”所代表的神性律法的一种直接的神性流注。<br />当如何理解这些事，这从前面（<a href="7009.htm">7009</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>节）所述可以看出来，即：“摩西”代表直接从神性发出的真理，“亚伦”代表间接发出的真理。人若不知道由连续层级构成的秩序的性质，就不可能知道流注的性质，所以必须简要说一说这个主题。直接从主发出的真理因来自无限的神性本身，故绝无可能被任何有限的活物，因而被任何天使接受。正因如此，主创造了连续下降的层级作为媒介，以便直接从祂发出的神性真理能通过这些媒介传下去。不过，远离祂的第一层级仍旧充满神性，以至于无法使这真理被任何有限的活物，因而被任何天使接受。鉴于此，主向下创造了另一个层级，以便直接从祂发出的神性真理通过该层级能在某种程度上被接受。这个层级就是存在于天堂的神之真理。这头两个层级在众天堂之上，就像围绕太阳，也就是主的火源辐射带。这就是直到离主最近的天堂，也就是第三层天堂的连续层级的性质，第三层天堂是那些纯真和智慧的人所在的地方。连续层级从那里继续下降到最低层的天堂，从最低层的天堂下降到人的感官和肉体层级，也就是这个系列中接受流注的末后层。<br />由此明显可知，层级从首先的，也就是主那里一个接一个地延续到人里面的末后和最低层级；事实上，延续到自然界中的末后和最低层级。人里面的末后和最低层级，和自然界中的层级一样，相对来说反应迟钝，因而是寒冷的；它们也相对笼统，因而是模糊的。由此明显可知，一切事物皆通过这些连续层级存在于与最初存在相联结的一个连续链条中。流注照着这些层级发生；因为直接从神性发出的神性真理流入一个接一个的层级。在下降的过程中，或在与每个新层级的联系中，它变得越发笼统，因而越发粗糙和模糊；还变得越发迟钝，因而越发惰性和寒冷。由此清楚可知由连续层级构成的神性秩序是何性质，进而可知流注的性质。<br />不过，众所周知，流入第三层天堂的神之真理离主最近；同时也一直流入秩序的末后和最低层级，无需经历形成物的连续层级。在该层的每一个事物也直接由那为首先的掌管和提供。连续层级以这种方式被一起保持在它们的适当秩序和联系中。这一真理也可从世上的学者所皆知的定律看出来，即：只有一种物质是真实的物质；其它一切事物都是来自它的形成物；在形成物里面，独一物质不仅作为形式，还作为非形式的东西，如作为产生它的东西掌权。若非如此，所形成的事物不可能持续存在并进行运作。不过，这些话是对能明白它们的人说的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7270</b></p><p><b>7270.</b>
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh. That this signifies the reception of the influx of the Divine and its communication, is evident from the representation 
of Moses, who was to speak, as being Divine truth; and from the representation of Aaron, as being the doctrine thence derived (see n. 7089); from the signification of "speaking," as being influx 
and its reception (see n. 5797); and from the signification of "commanding" as also being influx (n. 5486, 5732), here the reception of influx. From all this it is evident that by "speaking" is 
signified the mediate influx of Divine truth into doctrine, that is, with one who teaches (for the meaning is that Moses - who denotes Divine truth - should speak to Aaron who denotes doctrine or one 
who teaches - that which Jehovah commanded, thus should speak to him who was to communicate it); and that by "commanding" is signified the immediate Divine influx into the Divine law which is represented 
by Moses. 
 </p>
<p>[2] How these things are to be understood can be seen from what was said above (n. 7009, 7010), namely, that Moses represents the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine, and Aaron 
the truth which proceeds mediately. He who does not know how the case is with order in successive things, cannot know how it is with influx; wherefore it must be briefly told. The truth which proceeds 
immediately from the Lord, being from the infinite Divine Itself, cannot possibly be received by any living substance which is finite, thus not by any angel; and therefore the Lord created successive 
things by which as media the Divine truth that proceeds immediately can be communicated. But the first in succession from this is more full of the Divine than can as yet be received by any living 
substance which is finite, thus by any angel, and therefore the Lord created another successive through which the Divine truth that proceeds immediately might be in part received; this successive is 
the truth Divine which is in heaven. The first two are above the heavens, and are as it were radiant belts of flame which encompass the sun, which is the Lord. Such is the successive order down to the 
heaven nearest the Lord, which is the third heaven, where are those who are innocent and wise. From this the successives are continued down to the ultimate heaven, and from the ultimate heaven down 
to the sensuous and bodily of man, which receives the influx last.  
 </p>
<p>[3] From all this it is evident that there are continued successions from the First, that is, from the Lord, down to the ultimate things 
that are in man, nay, to the ultimate things that are in nature. The ultimate things in man, as also those in nature, are relatively inert, and thence cold, and are relatively general, and thence 
obscure. From this it is also evident that by means of these successions there is a continuous connection of all things with the First being. Influx is according to these successions, for the Divine 
truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine good, flows in successively; and in the way, or in connection with each new successive, it becomes more general, thus grosser and more obscure; and it 
becomes more slow, thus more inert and cold. From this it is clear what is the Divine order of successives, and thence of influxes. 
 </p>
<p>[4] But be it well known that the truth Divine which flows into the 
third heaven nearest the Lord, also at the same time and without successive formation flows in down to the ultimates of order, and there from the First immediately also rules and provides each and all 
things; whereby the successives are held together in their order and connection. That this is so can also in some measure be seen from a maxim not unknown to the learned in the world, that there is 
only one substance which is substance, and that all other things are formations thence; and that in the formations that one only substance reigns, not only as form, but also as non-form, as in its origin. 
Unless this were so, a thing formed could not possibly subsist and act. But these things are said for the intelligent. </p>

'You Shall speak all that I command you, [and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh,] means the reception of Divine influx, and communication. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses', who 
is to speak, as Divine Truth, and from the representation of 'Aaron as teachings derived from it, both dealt with in <a href="7089.htm">7089</a>; from the meaning of 'speaking' as influx and the reception of it, dealt with 
in <a href="5797.htm">5797</a>; and from the meaning of 'commanding' too as influx, dealt with in <a href="5486.htm">5486</a>, <a href="5732.htm">5732</a>, here the reception of influx. From all this it is evident that 'speaking' means the influx of Divine Truth in an 
indirect way into doctrinal teachings, that is, with the teacher, (for it is implied that Moses, representing Divine Truth, was to speak what Jehovah commanded to Aaron, who represents doctrinal teachings 
or the teacher, thus to him who was to communicate it) and that 'commanding' means a direct Divine influx into the Divine Law, which 'Moses' represents.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 How these matters are to be understood 
may be seen from what has been stated already in <a href="7009.htm">7009</a>, <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, Where it is shown that 'Moses' represents truth that comes forth directly from the Divine, and that 'Aaron' represents the truth that 
comes forth in an indirect way. Anyone unacquainted with the nature of order consisting in consecutive degrees cannot be acquainted with the nature of influx either. Therefore let a brief statement 
be made on this subject. Since truth which comes forth directly from the Lord is from the Infinite and Divine Being Himself, it cannot be received at all by any living, finite substance, thus not by any 
angel. This being so, the Lord created degrees consecutively descending to serve as the means by which Divine Truth coming forth directly from Him could be communicated. But the first degree away from 
Him is still too full of the Divine to enable that Truth to be received by any living, finite substance, and so by any angel. On account of this the Lord created a further degree down, by which Divine 
Truth coming forth directly from Him was to some extent able to be received. This degree is God's truth which exists in heaven. These first two degrees are above the heavens; they are like belts, 
made radiant by a fiery source, which surround the Sun, which is the Lord. This is the nature of the consecutive degrees of order down to the heaven nearest to the Lord, which is the third heaven where 
the innocent and wise live. From there consecutive degrees continue down to the lowest heaven, and from the lowest heaven down to the degree of the senses and the body in man, the last in the series 
to receive influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it is clear that degrees one after another continue from Him who is the First, that is, the Lord, right down to the last and lowest present with man, indeed right 
down to the last and lowest present in the natural order. The last and lowest degrees present with man, like those in the natural order, are relatively unresponsive and consequently frigid; they 
are also relatively general and consequently obscure. From this it is also evident that through those consecutive degrees all things exist in a continuous chain linked to the First Being (Esse). And it 
is in accordance with those degrees that influx takes place; for Divine Truth coming forth directly from Divine Good flows into one degree after another. On the down or with each new degree it becomes 
more general, and so grosser and more obscure, and becomes more sluggish, and so more 
unresponsive and frigid. All this clarifies the nature of Divine Order consisting of consecutive degrees and consequently 
of the nature of influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But it should be fully recognized that God's truth, which flows into the third heaven nearest to the Lord, at the same time flows right down into the last and 
lowest degrees of order as well, without undergoing consecutive degrees of formation. Every single thing at that level is also directly governed and provided by Him who is the First. In this way the consecutive 
degrees are held together in their proper order and connection. The truth of this may also be recognized to some extent from the law not unknown to the learned in the world that there is only 
one substance which really is substance. Everything else is a formation from it, and that one and only substance reigns not solely as the form but as that too which is not the form, for instance, as 
that which gave rise to them. If this were not so, what has been formed could not remain in being and operate. But these matters are stated for him who may be able to understand them. </p>

`Tu loqueris omne quod praecepero tibi, [et Aharon frater tuus loquetur ad Pharaonem]': quod significet receptionem influxus Divini et communicationem {1}, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' qui 
loquetur, quod sit Divinum Verum, et (c)ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' {2} quod sit doctrina inde, de quibus n. 7089; ex significatione `loqui' quod sit influxus et ejus receptio, de qua n. 5797; et ex 
significatione `praecipere' quod etiam sit influxus, de qua n. 5486, 5732, hic receptio influxus; ex his patet quod per `loqui' significetur influxus mediatus Divini Veri in doctrinam, hoc est, {3}apud 
docentem, nam intelligitur quod Moscheh, qui est Divinum Verum, loqueretur quod praeciperet Jehovah, ad Aharonem, qui est doctrina seu docens, ita ad illum qui communicaret; et quod per praecipere 
significetur influxus immediatus Divinus in (t)Divinam Legem, quae repraesentatur per `Moschen.' 	2 Quomodo haec intelligenda sunt, constare potest ex illis quae prius n. 7009, 7010, dicta sunt, quod 
nempe Moscheh repraesentet verum quod immediate a Divino procedit, et quod Aharon repraesentet verum quod mediate; qui non scit quomodo cum ordine in successivis se habet, nec scire potest quomodo cum 
influxu; paucis ideo dicendum: verum quod immediate a Domino procedit, hoc quia ex Ipso Infinito Divino est, nullatenus potest recipi ab aliqua substantia viva quae finita, ita non ab aliquo angelo; 
quapropter {4}creaverat Dominus successiva per quae ut media communicari posset {5} Divinum Verum immediate procedens; {6}sed primum ex hoc successivum Divino plenius est quam ut adhuc recipi possit 
ab aliqua substantia viva quae finita, ita ab aliquo angelo {7}; idcirco Dominus adhuc creavit successivum, per quod Divinum Verum immediate procedens quoad aliquam partem {8}receptibile esset; hoc successivum 
est verum Divinum quod in caelo est; prima bina sunt supra caelos et sunt quasi cingula radiosa ex flammeo {9}quae circumdant Solem, Qui est Dominus; talis est ordo successivus usque ad caelum 
Domino proximum, quod est caelum tertium ubi {10}illi qui innocentes et sapientes; inde continuantur {11}successive usque ad caelum ultimum, et a caelo ultimo usque ad sensuale et corporeum hominis, 
quod postremo recipit 3 influxum; ex his constat quod continuae successiones sint a Primo, hoc est, a Domino, usque ad ultima quae sunt apud {12}hominem, immo ad ultima quae sunt in natura; ultima 
quae apud hominem, sicut et in natura, sunt pigra respective et inde frigida, et sunt communia respective ac inde obscura; inde etiam patet {13} quod per successiones illas sit nexus continuus omnium 
cum Primo Esse; secundum successiones illas {14}se habet influxus; nam Divinum Verum quod immediate procedit a Divino Bono, influit successive; et in via seu circa quodlibet novum successivum fit (x)communius, 
ita crassius et obscurius, et fit lentius, ita pigrius et frigidius; ex his {15}liquet qualis est Divinus Ordo successivorum, (c)ac inde influxuum. 	4 Sed probe sciendum quod verum {16}Divinum 
quod influit in tertium caelum Domino proximum etiam simul absque {17}successiva formatione influat usque in ultima ordinis, et ibi {18}a Primo immediate quoque regat et provideat omnia et singula; 
inde successiva in suo ordine et nexu continentur.  Quod ita sit, etiam aliquatenus constare potest a regula eruditis in mundo nec ignota, quod substantia, quae substantia, sit modo unica, et quod reliqua 
sint formationes inde, et quod in formationibus unica illa substantia regnet, {19}non modo ut forma sed etiam ut non forma, prout in sua origine; nisi ita esset, formatum nequaquam posset subsistere 
et agere; sed haec intelligenti sint dicta. 	@1 i above line cum illis qui in falsis  cp n. 7266$ 	@2 i ad quem loquetur,$ 	@3 in$ 	@4 creaverat altered to creavit$ 	@5 i hoc$ 	@6 primum inde
