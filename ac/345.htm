<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第345节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>345.</strong>“种地的”表缺乏仁，出于从爱分离之信行事者，这信根本就不是信，这一点从后文明显可知：即“耶和华看不中他的供物”，并且“他杀了他的兄弟”，也就是摧毁了亚伯所象征的仁。人若注目于肉体和尘世的事物，就说他们是“种地的”，这一点从创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.19.htm">3:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.23.htm">23</a>）明显可知，其中我们读到，人被“打发出伊甸园，耕种他所自出之土”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]345.</strong> One who cultivated the ground is people who lack charity, however attached they may be to a faith separated from love, which is no kind of faith. This can be seen from what follows — that Jehovah ignored Cain's offering and that Cain killed his brother or, in other words, destroyed the charity that Abel symbolized.<br />People whose sights were set on bodily and earthly interests were said to cultivate the ground. This can be seen from remarks made at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_345/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_19" target=_top>Genesis 3:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_345/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_23" target=_top>23</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_345/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_276" target=_top>276</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_345/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_305" target=_top>305</a>], where it says that the humans were sent away from the Garden of Eden to cultivate the ground. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 345</b></p><p><b>345.</b>
That a "tiller of the ground" is one who is devoid of charity, however much he may be in faith separated from love, which is no faith, is evident from what follows: that Jehovah had no respect to his 
offering, and that he slew his brother, that is, destroyed charity, signified by "Abel." Those were said to "till the ground" who look to bodily and earthly things, as is evident from what is said in 
Gen. 3:19, 23, where we read that the man was "cast out of the garden of Eden to till the ground." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 345</b></p><p><b>345.</b>
'A tiller of the ground' means someone who, devoid of charity, acts from faith separated from love, which is not faith at all. This becomes clear from the statements made further on, 'Jehovah had no 
respect for his gift', and 'he killed his brother', that is, he destroyed charity meant by Abel. People who look to bodily and earthly interests are said to be 'tilling the ground', as is clear from what 
has been stated at Chapter 3:19, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, where it is said that 'the man was sent out of the garden of Eden to till the ground'.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 345</b>
</p><b>345.</b>
Quod 'colens humum' sit qui absque charitate, utcumque ex fide separata ab amore, quae nulla fides, constare potest ab iis quae sequuntur, quod 'Jehovah non aspexit ad munus ejus,' et quod 'fratrem 
suum occidit,' hoc est, quod charitatem per 'Habelem' significatam destruxit. 'Colere humum' dicebantur qui corporea et terrestria spectant, sicut constat ab iis quae dicta sunt ad cap. {x}iii vers. 19, 
23; ubi dicitur quod 'homo emissus ex horto Eden ad colendum humum.' </p>
