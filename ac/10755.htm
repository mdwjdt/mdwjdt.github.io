<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10755节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10755</strong>.后来，传教士被带到一个更远的地方，尽管他不情愿，因为他还在想着他非常喜欢的那个女人，这从以下事实明显看出来：他在前一个地方留下的一种影子还出现在那里。然后，他来到赤身的人那里。这些人看上去成双成对结伴而行。每一对都是丈夫和妻子，腰间裹着一层布，头上围着某种遮盖物。当传教士与他们在一起时，他被带入在世上想要传道时所处的那种状态。于是，他告诉他们，他想给他们传道，主题是“被钉十字架的主”。但他们说，他们不愿听这种话，因为他们不知道这是什么意思，但他们知道主活着。然后他又声称，他想传讲“活着的主”。但他们还是不肯听，说，他们在他的话里没有察觉到任何天上的事物，只察觉到地上的事物，因为他的话大多是为了他自己，为了自己的名声和地位。他们解释说，他们能从他说话的语气听出他的话是发自内心还是出自口唇；他因是这种人，所以什么也教不了他们。他闻言沉默了。他活在世时，曾充满激情，以至于能深深打动他的听众，使他们崇敬。但他所展现的这种激情是他人为获得的，因而来自自我和世界，而不是来自天堂。</p>

Afterward the preacher was conducted further, but reluctantly, because he was still thinking of the woman with whom he was charmed, as was evident from there still appearing a kind of shadow of him in 
the former place. He then came to those who were naked, who were seen walking together two and two. They were husband and wife, and were girded with a covering about the loins, and with a sort of covering 
about the head. When the preacher was with these, he was brought into the state in which he had been in the world when he wished to preach; and he then said that he wished to preach to them the 
crucified Lord. But they said they did not wish to hear such a thing, because they know not what it is, and that they know that the Lord lives. He then said that he wished to preach the living Lord; 
but this also they refused, saying that they did not observe in his speech what is heavenly, but what is earthly, because it was much for the sake of himself, and his own reputation and honor; and that 
they could hear from the very tone of his speech whether it came from his heart, or only from his mouth; and that because he was of this kind he could not teach them; wherefore he was silent. When he 
lived in the world he had been very impassioned, so that he could deeply move his hearers to what is holy; but this impassioned style had been acquired by art, and therefore was from self and the world, 
and not from heaven. </p>

Afterwards the preacher was conducted to a place further on, though against his will since he was still thinking of the woman in whom he had taken very great delight, as was evident from the fact some 
of the shadow he had cast in the former place was still apparent there. He came then to those who were naked. These were seen walking together two and two. Each pair consisted of husband and wife, wearing 
a garment around their hips and some kind of covering around the head. While the preacher was with them he was brought into that state which had been his in the world when he wished to preach. 
He told them then that he wished to preach before them on the theme 'the Lord crucified'. But they said that they had no wish to listen to anything like that because they did not know what was meant by 
it, but that they did know that the Lord lives. Then he declared that he wished to preach on the theme 'the Lord who lives'. But they declined to listen to this too, saying that they detected nothing 
heavenly in his speech, only that which was earthly, because he was governed largely by self-interest and by concern for his own reputation and position. They explained that they could hear from the 
very sound of his voice whether his words came from the heart or only from the lips; and that being such as he was he could teach them nothing. At this he became silent. In the world he had been, when 
he lived there, most passionate, so much so that he had had the power to move his audience to reverence. But the passion which he exhibited had been acquired artificially by him and so had a selfish 
and worldly origin, not a heavenly one.  </p>

Postea praedicator perducebatur ulterius, sed {1}invite quia adhuc in cogitatione illius {2}feminae qua delectabatur erat, quod {3}patebat ex eo quod usque aliquid umbrae ex (c)illo appareret in {4}priore 
loco; veniebat tunc ad illos qui nudi erant; hi visi sunt bini et bini ambulantes una, erant maritus et uxor, cincti velamine circum lumbos, {5}ac quodam tegmine circum caput.  Praedicator cum 
apud hos erat, perducebatur in statum in quo fuit in mundo cum vellet praedicare, et tunc dixit quod coram illis vellet praedicare Dominum crucifixum sed dicebant quod non vellent audire tale, quia nesciunt 
quid hoc, et quod sciant quod Dominus vivat; aiebat tunc quod praedicare vellet Dominum vivum, sed (t)hoc quoque recusabant, dicentes quod apperciperent in loquela ejus non caeleste sed terrestre, 
quia multum propter se, sui famam et honorem; et quod audiant ex ipso sono loquelae num ex corde sit vel num solum ex ore; et quia talis quod non docere (c)eos posset; quapropter tacebat; fuerat in 
mundo cum vixit, maxime patheticus, sic ut perquam movere potuerit auditores ad sanctum, sed patheticum illud fuerat arte acquisitum, ita a se et mundo, et non e caelo. @1 invito AI, invitus T$ @2
