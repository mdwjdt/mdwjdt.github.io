<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5640节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5640.</strong>“就对管家的说”表属于外在教会的东西。这从“管家的”的代表清楚可知，当在家里的是内在教会（参看<a href="1795.htm">1795</a>节）时，“管家的”就是外在教会。由于内义不关注人，只关注属灵实际物（参看<a href="5225.htm">5225</a>，<a href="5287.htm">5287</a>，<a href="5434.htm">5434</a>节），所以“管家的”表示属于外在教会的东西。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5640</b></p><p><b>5640.</b>
And he said to him that was over his house. That this signifies to that which is of the external church, is evident from the representation of him that was over the house, as being the external church, 
when he who is in the house is the internal church (see n. 1795). And as in the internal sense the thing, and not the person, is regarded (see n. 5225, 5287, 5434), therefore by "him that was over 
the house" is signified that which is of the external church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5640</b></p><p><b>5640.</b>
'And he said to the one who was over his house' means that which belongs to the external Church. This is clear from the representation of 'the one who was over the house' as the external Church, when 
'the one who is in the house' is the internal Church, dealt with in <a href="1795.htm">1795</a>. And since no attention is paid in the internal sense to the person, only to the spiritual reality, <a href="5225.htm">5225</a>, <a href="5287.htm">5287</a>, <a href="5434.htm">5434</a>, 'the one 
who was over the house' means that which belongs to the external Church.  </p>

{1} `Et dixit ei qui super domo sua': quod significet ad id quod est Ecclesiae externae, constat ex repraesentatione `illius qui super domo' quod sit Ecclesia externa, cum `is qui in domo' sit Ecclesia 
interna, de qua n. 1795; et quia in sensu interno non spectatur persona sed res, n. 5225, 5287, 5434, ideo per `illum qui super domo' significatur id quod est Ecclesiae externae. @1 5640 was at 
first omitted in A but subsequently written on separate sheet with directions for insertion here.$ </p>
