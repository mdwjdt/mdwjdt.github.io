<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1306．“一座塔”表自我崇拜。这从“塔”的含义清楚可知。当人将自己置于他人之上，甚至到了被崇拜的地步时，自我崇拜就产生了。所以，我欲，也就是骄傲自大，就称作“高大”、“高耸”、“抬高”，凡在高处的事物都用来描述它，如以赛亚书：<br />到那日，眼目高傲的必降为卑，性情狂傲的都必屈膝，惟独耶和华被尊崇。必有万军耶和华降罚的一个日子，要临到骄傲狂妄的，一切自高的都必降为卑；又临到黎巴嫩高大的香柏树和巴珊的橡树；又临到一切高山和耸峙的山岭；又临到高塔和坚固城墙。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.11.htm">2:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这论及我欲，以在高处和被拔高的“香柏树”、“橡树”、“高山”、“山岭”、“高塔”来描述。<br />同一先知书：<br />在大行杀戮的日子，高塔倒塌的时候，各高山冈陵必有溪水涌流。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.25.htm">30:25</a>）<br />此处“塔”同样表我欲和敬拜中的高傲。<br />看哪，迦勒底人之地向来没有这民；亚述已将她委弃予野兽；他们要设立了望塔，拔高宫殿，他必将她毁灭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.13.htm">23:13</a>）<br />这论及推罗及其荒废。“了望塔”是“塔”的另一种表述，表由此而来的幻想。以西结书：<br />推罗啊，我必使许多国民上来攻击你，他们必破坏推罗的墙垣，拆毁她的高塔；我也要刮净她的尘土，使她成为净光的磐石。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.3.htm">26:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“塔”有同样的含义。<br />敬拜中的我欲，或自我崇拜，被称作“塔”，这是因为“城”表教义，如前所述（<a href="402.htm">402</a>节），以前，塔用于城市的防御工事，里面有守望的人。城市边境也有塔，因此，它们被称作“了望楼” （列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下9.17.htm">9:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.9.htm">17:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下18.8.htm">18:8</a>）和“了望塔” （以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.13.htm">23:13</a>）。此外，当主的教会被比作“葡萄园”时，敬拜的事物，以及对敬拜的维护就被比作“压酒池”和“葡萄园中的了望塔”，这明显可见于以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.1.htm">5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.2.htm">2</a>）、马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.33.htm">21:33</a>）和马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.1.htm">12:1</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1306.</strong> The fact that a tower is self-worship can be seen from the symbolism of a tower. Self-worship exists when we set ourselves up above others, so much so that we seek to be worshiped. As a result, self-love — which is conceit and pride — is called height, loftiness, and elevation, and it is depicted by anything that is high up, as in Isaiah:<br />The eyes of human pride will lower, and the loftiness of men will sink, and Jehovah alone will be exalted on that day. For the day of Jehovah Sabaoth will come over all the proud and lofty and over all the haughty (and they will be brought down) and over all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lifted up, and over all the oaks of Bashan, and over all the lofty mountains, and over all the tall hills, and over every high tower, and over every fortified wall. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_2_11-18" target=_top>Isaiah 2:11-18</a>)<br />The theme here is self-love, which is portrayed by cedars, oaks, mountains, hills, and a tower, which are tall and lofty.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />There will be brooks, channels of water, on the day of great slaughter, when towers fall. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_25" target=_top>Isaiah 30:25</a>)<br />Again it stands for self-love and for mixing conceit with worship. In the same author:<br />Look: the land of the Chaldeans! This people was not.{*1} Assyria founded [the land] among tsiyim.{*2} They will erect their spy towers; [the Chaldeans] will raise up their palaces; [Assyria] will make it a ruin. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_13" target=_top>Isaiah 23:13</a>)<br />This is about Tyre and its destruction. The spy towers — for which a different [Hebrew] word is being used{*3} — stand for the illusions that come from there. In Ezekiel:<br />I will bring many nations up against Tyre, and they will destroy Tyre's walls and demolish its towers, and I will remove its dirt from it and make it as dry as a rock. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_26_3-4" target=_top>Ezekiel 26:3-4</a>)<br />The meaning is similar.<br />[3] The reason self-love within worship (that is, self-worship) is called a tower is that a city symbolizes doctrine, as shown earlier (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_402" target=_top>402</a>), and towers patrolled by guards once formed the defenses of a city. Towers also dotted the borders and were accordingly called watchtowers (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_9_17" target=_top>2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_17_9" target=_top>17:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_18_8" target=_top>18:8</a>) and spy towers (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_13" target=_top>Isaiah 23:13</a>). In addition, when the Lord's church is compared to a vineyard, different facets of worship and of its preservation are compared to a winepress and to a tower in the vineyard, as can be seen in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_1-2" target=_top>Isaiah 5:1-2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_matthew_21_33" target=_top>Matthew 21:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/bible_king-james-version_mark_12_1" target=_top>Mark 12:1</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "Was not" is a Hebraism (לֹא‭ ‬הָיָה [lō hāyā]) suggesting that the people disappeared. At <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1368" target=_top>1368:1</a>, Swedenborg interprets the phrase as meaning that the people were not a people. [LHC]<br />{*2} Tsiyim is a transliteration of a plural Hebrew word (צִיִּים [ṣîyyîm]) whose meaning is uncertain. Although scholars today take them to be some kind of animal, Swedenborg took them to be some kind of bird (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1306/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_430" target=_top>Marriage Love 430</a>). Here as often elsewhere Swedenborg transliterates the word rather than translating it. [LHC]<br />{*3} Swedenborg is making a distinction between two terms for tower because they are different in Hebrew. To preserve this distinction, one (מִגְדָּל [miḡdāl]) is here translated "tower" (turris in Latin) and the other (בַּחוּנֵי [baḥûnê]) is translated "spy tower" (turris speculatoria in Latin).

That "a tower" is the worship of self, is evident from the signification of "a tower." The worship of self exists when a man exalts himself above others even to the point of being worshiped. And therefore 
the love of self, which is arrogance and pride, is called "height," "loftiness," and "being lifted up;" and is described by all things that are high. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The eyes of man's pride 
shall be humbled, and the loftiness of men shall be brought low, and Jehovah Himself alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of Jehovah of Armies is upon everyone proud and high and upon everyone 
that is lifted up, and he shall be humbled; and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan; and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills 
that are lifted up, and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fenced wall (Isa. 2:11-18); </p>
<p>concerning the love of self, which is described by the "cedars," "oaks," "mountains," "hills," and "tower" 
that are "high" and "lifted up."  [2] Again: </p>
<p>     There shall be rivers, streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers shall fall (Isa. 30:25); </p>
<p>in like manner denoting the love 
of self, and the exalting of self in worship. And again: </p>
<p>     Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not; Asshur hath founded it in tziim; they will set up their watchtowers, they will 
raise up their palaces, he will make it a ruin (Isa. 23:13); </p>
<p>said of Tyre and its vastation; "watchtowers," expressed by another word, denote the phantasies therefrom. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will cause 
many nations to come up against thee, O Tyre, and they shall ruin the walls of Tyre, and destroy her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and will make her the dryness of a rock (Ezek. 26:3-4); </p>
<p>the 
signification being similar.  [3] The love of self in worship, or the worship of self, is called a "tower," for the reason that a "city" signifies a doctrine (as before shown, n. 402) and cities 
were formerly fortified with towers, in which there were watchmen; and there were also towers on the borders, which for this reason were called "towers of watchmen" (2 Kings 9:17; 17:9; 18:8), and 
"watchtowers" (Isa. 23:13). And besides, when the church of the Lord is compared to a "vineyard," those things which belong to worship and to its conservation are compared to a "winepress" and to "a 
tower in the vineyard," as is evident in Isaiah 5:1, 2; Matt. 21:33; Mark 12:1. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1306</b></p><p><b>1306.</b>
That 'a tower' means worship of self is clear from the meaning of 'a tower'. It is worship of self when a person sets himself up above everybody else even to the point of his being worshipped. Consequently 
self-love, which is pride and arrogance, is called height, loftiness, and exaltedness, and everything high is used to describe it, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The eyes of man's (homo) loftiness will be humbled, 
and the height of men (vir) brought low, and Jehovah alone will be exalted on that day, for the day of Jehovah Zebaoth will be against everyone that is lofty and high, and against everyone that 
is lifted up. and he will be humbled, and against all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up and against all the oaks of Bashan, and against all high mountains, and against all hills that 
are lifted up, and against every lofty tower and against every fortified wall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%202:11-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 2:11-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to self-love, described by the cedars, oaks, mountains, hills, and tower that are high and exalted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
There will be brooks, streams of water, on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here likewise 'tower' stands for self-love and for 
exaltedness in worship. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the land of the Chaldeans! This people was not. Asshur founded her in tziim.

<p>This refers to Tyre and laying it waste. 'Watch-towers', a different expression from 'towers', stands for resulting delusions. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause 
many nations to come up against Tyre, and they will break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy her towers, and I will scrape her dust from her and make her a bare rock. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2026:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 26:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here likewise 
'towers' has the same meaning. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why self-love in worship, or worship of self, is called 'a tower' is that 'a city' means doctrine, as shown already in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, and cities in former times 
were fortified by towers with watchmen in them. Towers were also placed on their borders, and they were therefore called towers for watchmen, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 9:17; 17:9; 18:8, and watchtowers, Isa. 23:13. 
In addition, when the Lord's Church is compared to a vineyard, things of worship and also the preservation of it are compared to a winepress and to 'a tower in the vineyard', as is clear in Isa. 5:1, <a href="2.htm">2</a>; Matt. 21:33; Mark 12:1. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1306</b>
</p><b>1306.</b>
Quod 'turris' sit cultus sui, constat ex significatione 'turris'; cultus sui est cum ipse homo se altum facit prae alio, usque ut colatur; quare amor sui, qui est fastus et superbia, vocatur altitudo, 
celsitudo, elatio, et describitur per omnia quae alta sunt, ut apud Esaiam, 	Oculi superbiae hominis humiliabitur, et deprimetur altitudo virorum, et exaltabitur Jehovah solus Ipse in die illo, nam 
dies Jehovae Zebaoth, super omnem superbum et altum, et super omnem elatum, et humiliabitur; et super omnes cedros Libani altas et elatas, et super omnes quercus Bashanis, et super omnes montes altos, 
et super omnes colles elatos; et super omnem turrim excelsam, et super omnem murum munitum, ii 11-18;       ubi de amore sui, qui per 'cedros, quercus, montes, colles, turrim, quae alta et elata 
sunt,' describitur: apud eundem,                    	[2] Erunt... rivi, ductus aquarum, in die caelis magnae, cum cadent turres, xxx 25;                                           similiter pro amore 
sui, et elatione in cultu: apud eundem,            	En terra Chaldaeorum, hic populus non fuit, Asshur fundavit eam in tziim, erigent speculatorias turres suas, excitabunt palatia sua, ponet eam in 
ruinam, xxiii (x)13;                            de Tyro et ejus vastatione; 'speculatoriae turres,' alia voce, pro phantasiis inde: apud Ezechielem,                                    	Ascendere faciam 
contra Tyrum gentes multas,... et perdent muros Tyri, et destruent turres ejus, et detraham pulverem ejus ab ea, et dabo eam ariditatem petrae, xxvi 3, 	4;              [3]	similiter.  Quod amor 
sui in cultu seu cultus sui vocetur 'turris,' est causa quia 'urbs' significat doctrinam, ut ostensum est prius n. 402, et olim urbes muniebantur turribus, in quibus custodes; etiam turres erant in terminis, 
quare appellatae sunt turres custodum, 2 Reg. ix 17; xvii 19; xviii 8; et turres speculatoriae, Esai. xxiii 13; praeter etiam cum Ecclesia Domini comparatur vineae, illa quae sunt cultus, tum 
conservationis ejus, comparantur torculari et 'turri in vineae, ut constat apud Esai. v 1, 2; Matth. xxi 33; Marc. xii 1. </p>
