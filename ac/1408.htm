<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1408节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1408.</strong>此处和下文所发生的历史事件如所记载的那样；然而，所描述的历史事件具有代表性，每一个词都具有属灵之义。圣言的所有历史都是这样，不仅包括摩西书的历史，还包括约书亚记、士师记、撒母耳记、列王记的历史，所有这些表面上看仅仅是历史。不过，尽管它们在字义上是历史，但在内义上却储存和隐藏着天堂的奥秘。只要心智让眼睛专注于历史细节，就永远不可能发现这些奥秘。它们也不会被揭示出来，除非心智剔除字义。主的圣言就象一具肉体，里面有活生生的灵魂。只要心智专注于肉体之物，以致几乎不相信灵魂的存在，更不相信它死后还会活着，属灵魂的事物就不会显现出来。不过，一旦心智退离肉体之物，那些属灵魂和生命之物就会变得明显。这不仅是为何人在新生或重生之前，肉体之物必须死去的原因，也是为何在他能进入天堂、看到天堂之物之前，肉体之物必须死去的原因。<br />这也是主圣言的情形：它的肉体部分就是构成字义的事物；心智若专注于这些事物，就根本看不到内在事物；不过，一旦肉体部分仿佛死去，内在事物就会呈现出来。尽管如此，字义上的事物仍如同那些与处于肉身之人同在的事物，即记忆的知识，这些知识出自感性事物，里面包含内部或内在事物。由此可知，容器是一回事，包含在容器中的本质要素又是另一回事。容器是属世的，包含在容器中的本质要素是属灵、属天的。圣言的历史同样如此，在圣言中，所有的表述都是一般的、属世的，事实上是物质容器，容器里面包含属灵、属天之物，这些事物若不通过内义，永远不会呈现出来。<br />仅凭以下事实，谁都能清楚看出这一点：在圣言中，很多事物都是照着表象说的，事实上，是照着感官幻觉说的，如主发怒、降罚、诅咒、杀戮，以及很多其它类似陈述。然而，事实上，它们在内义上完全相反，也就是说，主决不发怒和降罚，更不会诅咒和杀戮。不过，对那些以简单的心思照字面的理解相信圣言的人而言，他们只要活在仁爱中，就根本不会受到任何伤害。原因在于，圣言的教导只在于此：即每个人都要活在对邻舍的仁爱中，并且爱主高于一切。凡这样做的人都拥有内在事物；因此，对他们来说，从字义得来的幻觉很容易被驱散。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1408.</strong> The events of this verse and later ones happened as written, but the historical facts are representative and the words are each symbolic.<br />This is true of all the narrative parts of the Word 钬?not only the books of Moses but Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings as well. Nothing but history appears in any of them. Yet although the literal meaning is a history, the inner meaning holds the mysteries of heaven, which lie hidden there. These mysteries can never be seen, as long as we train our mind's eye on the historical details; they are not unveiled until we withdraw our minds from the literal meaning.<br />The Lord's Word is like a body with a living soul. Anything having to do with the soul remains invisible 钬?to the point that we scarcely believe we even have a soul, let alone that it lives on after death 钬?as long as the body monopolizes our thinking. As soon as concern for our person ebbs from our minds, though, qualities of the soul and of life reveal themselves. That is why everything connected with our body has to die before we can be born anew or regenerate. Not only that, the body itself also has to die, so that we can enter heaven and behold heavenly sights.<br />[2] The case with the Lord's Word is the same. Its "body" is the contents of the literal meaning, and as long as we fix our minds on those, we see nothing deeper. When they "die," though, [the deeper content] first stands out in plain sight.<br />Still, the features of the literal sense are like those things in us that belong to the body. Specifically, they are like facts that we glean from our sense impressions and retain in our memory. These are general containers that hold deeper levels inside.{*1} You can see from this that containers are one thing, the vital concepts contained within them are another. The containers are earthly; their vital contents are spiritual and heavenly. So also with the historical passages of the Word, and with the individual words there as well. They are general containers that are earthly and even physical, and they hold spiritual and heavenly features. The latter never enter our field of vision except through the inner meaning.<br />[3] Anyone can see this merely from the consideration that the Word often speaks in accord with appearances and even in accord with illusions of the senses. It says, for instance, that the Lord feels anger, punishes people, curses them, kills them, and so on, when in fact the inner meaning says the opposite 钬?that the Lord never feels anger or punishes people, let alone cursing or killing them. Yet it does not hurt people to believe in simplicity of heart that the Word is just what they take it to be in the letter, as long as they live lives of neighborly love. The reason it does no harm is that the Word teaches nothing but the need for each of us to live in charity with our neighbor and to love the Lord above all. People who do this have deeper dimensions inside, so any illusions they acquire from the literal meaning are easily dispelled.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This explanation of the literal meaning by invocation of analogies to the body and to mental processes has parallels elsewhere in Swedenborg's works. In essence, he is describing the literal meaning as an external, earthly-level entity, which in his theology would typically be more generalized than an inner, spiritual entity. The implication is that each sense-based fact, or each literal expression of Scripture, contains myriads of spiritual ideas, and each of these spiritual ideas contains myriads of heavenly ideas. See 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1408/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_190" target=_top>190</a> of his 1763 work Divine Love and Wisdom, where he compares this phenomenon of levels to the bundling of fine muscle fibers into larger fibers and of these into the muscles themselves.

These and the things which follow occurred historically as they are written; but the historicals are representatives and all the words are significative. The case is the same with all the historicals 
of the Word, not only with those in the books of Moses, but also with those in the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. In all these, nothing is apparent but mere history; but although it is history 
in the sense of the letter, still in the internal sense there are arcana of heaven, which lie stored up and hidden there, and which can never be seen so long as the mind, together with the eye, 
is kept in the historicals; nor are they revealed until the mind is removed from the sense of the letter. The Word of the Lord is like a body that contains within it a living soul; the things belonging 
to the soul do not appear while the mind is so fixed in corporeal things that it scarcely believes that there is a soul, still less that it will live after death; but as soon as the mind withdraws 
from corporeal things, those which are of the soul and life become manifest. And this also is the reason, not only why corporeal things must die before man can be born anew, or be regenerated, but also 
why the body itself must die so that he may come into heaven and see heavenly things.  [2] Such also is the case with the Word of the Lord: its corporeal things are those which are of the sense of 
the letter; and when the mind is kept in these, the internal things are not seen at all; but when the former are as it were dead, then for the first time are the latter presented to view. But still the 
things of the sense of the letter are similar to those which are with man while in the body, to wit, to the knowledges of the memory that come from the things of sense, and which are general vessels 
that contain interior or internal things within them. It may be known from this that the vessels are one thing, and the essentials contained in the vessels another. The vessels are natural; the essentials 
contained in the vessels are spiritual and celestial. So likewise the historicals of the Word, and all the expressions in the Word, are general, natural, and indeed material vessels, in which are 
things spiritual and celestial; and these in no wise come into view except by the internal sense. [3] This will be evident to everyone from the mere fact that many things in the Word are said according 
to appearances, and indeed according to the fallacies of the senses, as that the Lord is angry, that He punishes, curses, kills, and many other such things; when yet in the internal sense they mean 
quite the contrary, namely, that the Lord is in no wise angry and punishes, still less does He curse and kill. And yet to those who from simplicity of heart believe the Word as they apprehend it in 
the letter, no harm is done while they live in charity. The reason is that the Word teaches nothing else than that everyone should live in charity with his neighbor, and love the Lord above all things. 
They who do this have in themselves the internal things; and therefore with them the fallacies taken from the sense of the letter are easily dispelled. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1408</b></p><p><b>1408.</b>
The events described here and in what follows took place in history as they are recorded, yet the historical events as described are representative, and every word carries a spiritual meaning. This is 
so in all of the historical parts of the Word, not only in the Books of Moses but also in those of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, all of which books contain nothing else than historical narratives. 
But although they are historical narratives in the sense of the letter, in the internal sense there are arcana of heaven lying hidden there. These arcana cannot possibly be seen as long as the mind 
keeps its eye fixed on the historical details, nor are they disclosed until the mind removes itself from the sense of the letter. The Word of the Lord is like a body that has a living soul within it. 
The things that belong to the soul are not apparent as long as the mind is fixed on those of the body, so much so that it scarcely believes it possesses a soul, even less that it will be alive after 
death. But as soon as the mind departs from bodily things, those belonging to the soul and to life show themselves; and in this lies the reason not only why bodily things must die before a person can 
be born anew or be regenerated, but also why the body must die so that he can enter heaven and behold heavenly things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The same applies to the Word of the Lord Its bodily parts are the things 
that constitute the sense of the letter, and when the mind is fixed on these the internal things are not seen at all. But once the bodily parts so to speak have died, the internal for the first time are 
brought to view. All the same, the things constituting the sense of the letter are like the things present with man in his body, namely the facts belonging to the memory which come in through the senses 
and which are general vessels containing interior or internal things. From this one may recognize that the vessels are one thing and the essential elements within the vessels another. The vessels 
are natural, and the essential elements within the vessels are spiritual and celestial. In the same way the historical narratives of the Word, as with each individual expression in the Word, are general, 
natural, indeed material vessels that have spiritual and celestial things within them. These things never come into sight except through the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This may become clear to anyone 
simply from the fact that many matters in the Word have been stated according to appearances, indeed according to the illusions of the senses, such as that the Lord is angry, punishes, curses, slays, 
and many other such statements, when in fact the internal sense contains the reverse, namely that the Lord is never angry or punishes, still less curses or slays. All the same, no harm at all is done 
to people who in simplicity of heart believe the Word as they find it in the letter so long as they are leading charitable lives, the reason being that the Word teaches nothing other than this - that 
everyone ought to live in charity with his neighbour and to love the Lord above all things. People doing this are in possession of the internal things, and thus with them the illusions acquired from 
the sense of the letter are easily dispersed. </p>

Haec et sequentia se ita habent historice, sicut scripta sunt, sed historica sunt repraesentativa, omnia verba sunt significativa: se ita res habet in omnibus historicis Verbi, non solum in libris Mosis 
sed etiam in Josuae, Judicum, Samuelis et Regum, in quibus omnibus nihil aliud apparet quam historicum; sed tametsi historicum est in sensu litterae, usque in sensu interno sunt arcana caeli quae 
recondita ibi latent; quae arcana nusquam videri possunt quamdiu mens cum oculo tenetur in historicis, nec prius revelantur quam cum mens a sensu litterae removetur: se habet Verbum Domini sicut corpus 
in quo anima viva; quae animae sunt, non apparent dum inhaeret mens corporeis, adeo ut vix credat se animam habere, minus quod victura post mortem; ut primum vero a corporeis recedit, patent illa quae 
animae et vitae sunt; quae etiam causa est, non solum quod moritura corporea antequam homo potest e novo nasci aut regenerari, sed etiam quod corpus moriturum ut venire possit in caelum ac videre caelestia: 
ita se habet cum Verbo Domini; illius corporea sunt illa quae sunt sensus litterae, in quibus cum mens tenetur, interna nusquam videntur, sed quando quasi mortua sunt, tunc primum sistuntur 
videnda: sed usque sunt illa quae sunt sensus litterae similia illis qua apud hominem in ejus corpore, nempe scientificis memoriae quae ex sensualibus sunt, quae sunt vasa communia in quibus interiora 
seu interna; inde sciri potest quod aliud sint vasa et aliud essentialia quae in vasis; vasa sunt naturalia, essentialia quae in vasis, sunt spiritualia et caelestia; ita quoque historica Verbi, ut et 
singulae voces in Verbo, sunt vasa communia, naturalia, immo materialia, in quibus spiritualia et caelestia; haec nusquam in conspectum veniunt nisi per sensum internum: unicuivis hoc constare potest 
solum ex eo quod multa in Verbo secundum apparentias, immo secundum fallacias sensuum, dicta sint; ut quod Dominus irascatur, puniat, maledicat, occidat, et talia plura, cum tamen in sensu interno contraria 
sunt; nempe quod Dominus nusquam irascatur et puniat, minus maledicat et occidat; usque tamen iis qui ex simplicitate cordis credunt Verbum sicut illud capiunt in littera, nihil nocet dum in 
charitate vivunt; causa est quia Verbum nihil aliud docet quam ut quisque cum proximo vivat in charitate, utque ament Dominum supra omnia; qui hoc faciunt, illi habent interna apud se, et sic apud eos 
fallaciae ex sensu litterae captae facile discutiuntur. </p>
