<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3308节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3308.</strong>“两个孩子渐渐长大”表初始状态，也就是良善与真理联结的状态。这从“渐渐长大”和“两个孩子”的含义清楚可知：当论及良善与真理的起源和发展时，“渐渐长大”是指后者，也就是这种发展的初始状态，如下文所述；“两个孩子”是指良善与真理，因为以扫这个孩子代表良善，雅各这个孩子代表真理，如前所示。良善与真理的情况和后代一样，因为它们成孕，在子宫里，出生，长大，并且也随着年龄增长，直至最后的岁月。它们成孕、在子宫里、出生，属于起源的状态；但它们长大、随着年龄增长，直至最后的岁月，则属于发展的状态。发展的状态随着出生而来，是良善与真理联结的状态。该状态的初始阶段就是此处“渐渐长大”所表示的。这个状态出生之后随即开始，并继续下去，直到生命结束；对那些处于良善的人来说，在肉身生命之后则延续到永恒。天使就是以这种方式不断得以完善的。</p>

The boys grew up. That this signifies the first state, namely, of the conjunction of good and truth, is evident from the signification of "growing up," when predicated of good and truth in respect to 
origin and progress, as being the first state of the latter, namely, of progress, concerning which hereafter; and from the signification of the "boys," as being good and truth; for good is represented 
by the "boy Esau," and truth by the "boy Jacob," as before shown. The case with good and truth is the same as with offspring, in that they are conceived, are in the womb, are born, grow up, and also 
advance in age even to the last. That they are conceived, are in the womb, and are born, pertains to the state of origin; but that they grow up, and advance in age even to the last, pertains to the state 
of progress. The state of progress advances in succession from the birth, and is a state of the conjunction of good and truth. The first of this state is that which is here signified by "growing 
up." This state commences immediately after birth, and is continued even to the last of life; and with those who are in good, after the life of the body to eternity. The angels are thus being continually 
perfected. </p>

'The boys grew up' means the initial state, that is to say, of the joining together of good and truth. This is clear from the meaning of growing up' when it has reference to the birth and development 
of good and truth, as the initial state of such development, dealt with in what follows; and from the meaning of 'the boys' as good and truth, for good is represented by the boy Esau, and truth by the 
boy Jacob, as shown above. Good and truth are like offspring, in that they are conceived, lie in the womb, are born, grow up, and also advance in years until they reach their final years. Their conception, 
lying in the womb, and being born belong to the state of birth, whereas their growing up and advancing in years until they reach their final years belong to the state of development. The state 
of development follows actual birth and is a state when good and truth are joined together. The initial phase of this state is what is meant here by 'growing up'. This state begins immediately after 
actual birth and continues through to the end of life; and with those in whom good is present it continues for ever following the life of the body. Angels go on being perfected constantly in this manner. </p>

</p><b>3308.</b>
`Adoleverunt pueri:' quod significet statum primum, nempe conjunctionis boni et veri, constat ex significatione `adolescere,' cum praedicatur de bono et vero quoad ortum et {1}progressum, quod sit hujus, 
nempe progressus, status primus, de quo sequitur; et (c)a significatione `puerorum' quod sit bonum et verum, bonum enim repraesentatur per puerum Esavum, et verum per puerum Jacobum, ut supra ostensum: 
cum bono et vero se habet sicut cum prole, quod concipiantur, quod sint in utero, quod nascantur, quod adolescant, tum quod crescant aetate usque ad ultimam {2}; quod concipiantur, sint in utero 
et nascantur, pertinet ad statum ortus; quod autem adolescant, crescant aetate usque ad ultimam, pertinet ad statum {3}progressus; {4}status progressus succedit a nativitate, et est status conjunctionis 
boni et veri; primum hujus status est, quod significatur hic per `adolescere'; hic status incipit ilico post nativitatem, et continuatur usque ad ultimum vitae, et apud illos qui in bono sunt, post 
vitam corporis in aeternum; angeli ita continue perficiuntur. @1 progressionem$  @2 ip 3298$  @3 progressionis$  @4 status progressionis succedunt ordine a nativitate et sunt status conjunctionis 
boni et veri, quorum status primus est qui$  </p>
