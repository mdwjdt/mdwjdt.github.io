<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1721节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1721.</strong>“所多玛王出来迎接他”表邪恶与虚假向祂屈服。这从“所多玛王”和“出来迎接”的含义清楚可知：“所多玛王”是指邪恶与虚假，就是争战的对象；“出来迎接”表屈服。此处之所以提及所多玛王，是因为这一事实，即屈服的邪恶与虚假在此是一系列出现的；不过，下面21节会专门论述他。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1721.</strong> The king of Sodom went out to meet him means that evil and falsity surrendered, as can be seen from this: The king of Sodom symbolizes the evil and falsity that had been fought, and going out to meet means surrendering.<br />It was part of the series of events that evil and falsity surrendered, and that is why the king of Sodom is mentioned here; but he is discussed below at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1721/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_21" target=_top>21</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1721/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1740" target=_top>1740</a>]. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1721</b></p><p><b>1721.</b>
The king of Sodom went out to meet him. That this signifies that the evil and falsity submitted themselves, is evident from the signification of "the king of Sodom," as being the evil and falsity against 
which was the combat; and from the signification of "going out to meet," as being to submit one's self. The king of Sodom is here spoken of, because the fact that evil and falsity submitted themselves 
occurs here in the series; but he is [specially] treated of in verse 21, which follows.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1721</b></p><p><b>1721.</b>
That 'the king of Sodom went out to meet him' means that the evil and falsity submitted to Him is clear from the meaning of 'the king of Sodom' as the evil and falsity against which the conflict took 
place, and from the meaning of 'going out to meet' as submitting. Mention is made here of the king of Sodom because of this point occurring in the sequence of thought, that the evil and falsity submitted 
themselves to Him; but that king is not specifically the subject until verse 21 below. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1721</b>
</p><b>1721.</b>
'Exivit rex Sodomae obviam illi': quod significet malum et falsum quod se submiserit, constat a significatione 'regis Sodomae' quod sit malum et falsum contra quod pugnatum; et ex significatione 'exire 
obviam' quod sit se submittere: quia in serie est quod malum et falsum se submiserit, hic de rege Sodomae dicitur, sed in vers. 21 seq. de {1}illo agitur. @1 illo here = Rex Sodomae.$  </p>
