<p><strong>[NCE]72.</strong> Allow me, then, to offer at the end of this chapter an account of our revival from the dead and entry into eternal life [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_72/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_168" target=_top>168-181</a>]. </p>

At the end of this chapter, accordingly, I am allowed to tell how man is raised from the dead and enters into the life of eternity. </p>
<p>     CHAPTER 2 </p>
<p>     1. And the heavens and the earth were finished, 
and all the army of them.      2. And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.      3. And God blessed 
the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that in it He rested from all His work which God in making created.      4. These are the nativities of the heavens and of the earth when He created them, in 
the day in which Jehovah God made the earth and the heavens.     5. And there was no shrub of the field as yet in the earth, and there was no herb of the field as yet growing, because Jehovah God had 
not caused it to rain upon the earth. And there was no man to till the ground.      6. And He made a mist to ascend from the earth, and watered all the faces of the ground.      7. And Jehovah God 
formed man, dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man became a living soul.      8. And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man 
whom He had formed.      9. And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree desirable to behold, and good for food; the tree of lives also, in the midst of the garden; and the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil.      10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted, and was into four heads.      11. The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which 
compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.      12. And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.      13. And the name of the second river is Gihon; 
the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.      14. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is it which goeth eastward toward Assyria; and the fourth river is Euphrates.      15. 
And Jehovah God took the man, and put him in the garden of Eden, to till it and take care of it.      16. And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden eating thou mayest 
eat.      17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die. </p>

At the end of this chapter let it be told how man is awakened from the dead and enters the life of eternity.    <h3>GENESIS 2:1-17</h3>

<p><LI value='1'> And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of 
them.  <LI value='2'> And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made, and rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.  <LI value='3'> And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, for 
on that day He rested from all His work which God had created when making it.  <LI value='4'> These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when He created them, on the day in which Jehovah God made the 
earth and the heavens.  <LI value='5'> And no shrub of the field was yet on the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth; and there was no man to 
till the ground.  <LI value='6'> And He caused a mist to go up from the earth, and it watered all the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground.  <LI value='7'> And Jehovah God formed the man, dust from the ground; and He breathed into his nostrils 
the breath of life;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and man became a living soul.  <LI value='8'> And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, from the east, and there He put the man whom He had formed.  <LI value='9'> And Jehovah God caused to spring 
up out of the ground every tree desirable to the sight and good for food; and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  <LI value='10'> And a river was going out 
of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.  <LI value='11'> The of the first is the Pishon; this encompasses the whole land of Havillah, where there is gold. <LI value='12'> And the gold 
of that land is good; bdellium is there and the shoham stone.  <LI value='13'> And the name of the second river is the Gihon, that which encompasses the whole land of Cush.  <LI value='14'> And the name of the third river is 
the Hiddekel. This goes eastwards towards Asshur. And the fourth river is the Phrath.  <LI value='15'> And Jehovah God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden, to till it and to care for it.  <LI value='16'> And 
Jehovah God commanded the man and said, From every tree in the garden you may indeed eat.  <LI value='17'> But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat 
of it you will surely die.
