<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6813节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6813.</strong>当水星灵来到其它社群时，会从他们那里搜索他们所知道的，一经完成就离开。灵人当中就有这种交流，以便当他们在一个社群中时，若被接纳和喜爱，他们可以共享他们所知道的一切；但不是通过任何言语，而是通过流注共享。水星灵因他们所获得的知识而无比自豪。因此，我告诉他们说，尽管他们知道无数事物，但还有无数事物是他们所不知道的；即使他们的知识永远在增长，他们依旧无法获得事物最宽泛的轮廓。至于他们的骄傲自负和自视甚高，我接着告诉他们说，这是不得体的。但他们回答说，这不是骄傲，仅仅因他们的记忆力而欢欣。他们以这种方式就能原谅自己的过错。</p>

When the spirits of Mercury come to other societies, they search out from them what they know, and as soon as they have done this they depart. There is such a communication among spirits that when they 
are in a society, if they are accepted and loved, all things which they know are communicated, and this not by any speech, but by influx. By reason of their knowledges the spirits of Mercury are more 
conceited than others, and they were therefore told that although they know innumerable things, still there are infinite things which they do not know; and that if their knowledges should increase 
to eternity, they would not attain even to a knowledge of generals. They were told also of their conceit and elation of mind, and how unbecoming this is; but they answered that it is not conceit, but 
only a glorying in their faculty of memory. In this way they can excuse their faults. </p>

When spirits belonging to Mercury go to other communities they seek to discover the things they know, and having discovered them they depart. Besides there exists among spirits a spirit of sharing which 
is such that if they are in a community in which they feel accepted and loved they share everything they know. And they do it not by the use of any kind of speaking but by influx. Because of all the 
knowledge they have acquired the spirits belonging to Mercury are extraordinarily proud of themselves, on account of which I have told them that although they know countless numbers of things there 
is nevertheless an infinite number they do not know, and that even if the number of things they know were to go on increasing for evermore they still could not attain an acquaintance with even the broadest 
outlines of things. I have gone on to tell them that they have pride and a high opinion of themselves, and that these are unbecoming. But they have replied that it is not pride but merely exultation 
because of the power of memory they possess; and in this way they are able to excuse their faults. </p>

Cum spiritus Mercurii ad alias societates veniunt, ab illis explorant quae sciunt, quibus exploratis discedunt; datur etiam talis communicatio inter spiritus ut cum in societate sunt, si accepti sunt 
et amati, {1}communicentur omnia quae norunt, et hoc non per aliquam loquelam, sed per influxum.  Ex cognitionibus {2}suis sunt spiritus Mercurii prae aliis fastosi, quare illis dictum quod licet innumera 
(x)sciant usque tamen {3}infinita sint quae non sciunt; et si cognitiones apud illos in aeternum augerentur, quod {4} ne quidem ad notitiam {5} communium pervenire queant; quod illis fastus et 
elatio animi, (m)dictum est et quod hoc non deceat {6}, sed responderunt quod non fastus {7} sit, sed modo gloriatio ex memoriae {8}suae facultate; ita {9} possunt naevos suos exculpare.(n) 	@1 tunc
