<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8985节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8985.</strong>“倘或奴仆明说”表那时源于所植入真理的思维。这从“说”和“奴仆”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指思维（参看<a href="7094.htm">7094</a>，<a href="7107.htm">7107</a>，<a href="7244.htm">7244</a>节）；“奴仆”是指没有相应良善的真理（<a href="8974.htm">8974</a>节），在此是指被确认或强化并植入时的这真理，因为这话是指着那即将出去时的奴仆说的（<a href="8984.htm">8984</a>节）。我们虽说“奴仆”表示真理，但所表示的是一个充满缺乏相应良善的真理之人。之所以说“奴仆”表示真理，而不说“奴仆”表示一个充满这种真理的人，是因为天使的语言就是这种抽象的语言，也就是从人抽离出来的语言。事实上，在天上，他们会思想某个事物而不去设想人，因为当他们的思维涉及人时，它会让他们想起与他们正在思想的那个事物有关的社群；当这种情况发生时，他们的思维就被缩窄到那个社群，并固定在它上面。<br />在天上，思想一个地方会导致出现在那个地方；他们在那个社群的出现会将社群里的那些人的思维吸引到自己这里，从而干扰那里来自神性的流注。当他们抽象地思想或谈论某个事物时，情况就截然不同了；在这种情况下，思维会照着从神性发出的流注所产生的天堂形式而朝各个方向发散，并且不会干扰任何社群。因为它触及社群的总体气场，不会影响或扰乱社群里的任何人，因而不会损害任何人照着来自神性的流注进行思考的自由。简言之，抽象思维能遍及整个天堂，处处畅通无阻；而缩窄到人或地方的思维则变得固定和停滞。</p>

And if saying the servant shall say. That this signifies thought then from the implanted truth, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being thought (see n. 7094, 7107, 7244); and from the 
signification of "manservant," as being truth without the corresponding good (n. 8974); here, this truth confirmed and implanted, because it is said of that servant when he was about to go forth (n. 
8984). It is said that "manservant" denotes truth, but there is meant the man who is in truth without the corresponding good. The reason why truth is called a "manservant," and not the man who is in such 
truth, is that abstract speech, that is, speech separate from man, is angelic speech. For in heaven they think about a thing apart from the person, because when the person also is there thought of, 
the society which is in the thing in question is excited, and thus the thought is determined thither, and is fixed. For in heaven where the thought is, there the presence is; and presence would bend 
to itself the thoughts of those who are in the society, and would thus disturb the influx from the Divine there. It is otherwise when they think abstractedly about a thing; in this case the thought diffuses 
itself in every direction according to the heavenly form which the influx proceeding from the Divine produces, and this without the disturbance of any society. For it insinuates itself into the 
general spheres of the societies, and in this case does not touch or move anyone in the society; thus does not divert anyone from the freedom of thinking according to the influx from the Divine. In 
a word, abstracted thought can pervade the whole heaven without stopping anywhere; but thought determined to person, or to place, is fixed and stays. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8985</b></p><p><b>8985.</b>
'And if the slave says plainly' means thought then springing from the implanted truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as thought, dealt with in <a href="7094.htm">7094</a>, <a href="7107.htm">7107</a>, <a href="7244.htm">7244</a>; and from the meaning of 'the 
slave' as truth without complementary good, dealt with in <a href="8974.htm">8974</a>, at this point this truth when it has been strengthened and implanted, since it is speaking of that slave when about to go out, <a href="8984.htm">8984</a>. 
'The slave' is said to mean truth, though a person imbued with truth devoid of complementary good is meant. The reason for saying that 'the slave' means truth and not a person imbued with such truth 
is that when angels speak they do so in the abstract, that is, without envisaging actual persons. For in heaven they think about matters without envisaging persons, because when their thought involves 
persons it brings to mind a community associated with the matter they are thinking about; and when this happens their thought is narrowed down to and becomes fixed on that community. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In heaven 
thinking about a place leads to being present in that place, and their presence in that community would attract towards itself the thoughts of those within the community, and so would disrupt the inflow 
from the Divine there. It is quite different when they speak in the abstract about some matter; their thought then spreads out in every direction in accord with the heavenly form which the influx 
emanating from the Divine produces, without causing disruption in any community. For it reaches into communities' general spheres, yet without having an effect on or unsettling anyone within the community, 
and so without impairing anyone's freedom to think in accord with the inflow from the Divine. In short, abstract thought can pass through the whole of heaven without hindrance anywhere; but thought 
narrowed down to persons or places becomes fixed and static. </p>

`Et si dicendo dixerit servus': quod significet cogitationem tunc ex vero implantato, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit cogitatio, de qua n.  7094, 7107, 7244, et ex significatione `servi' 
quod sit verum absque bono correspondente, de qua n.  8974, hic verum illud confirmatum et implantatum, quia dicitur de illo servo cum exiturus, n.  8984.  Dicitur quod `servus' sit verum, sed intelligitur 
homo qui in vero est absque bono correspondente; causa quod `servus' dicatur verum et non homo qui in tali vero, est quia loquela abstracta, hoc est, separata ab homine, est loquela angelica, nam 
in caelo cogitatur de re absque persona; cum enim ibi etiam persona cogitatur, tunc excitatur societas quae in tali re, et sic determinatur cogitatio illuc, 2 et figitur; nam in caelo, ubi cogitatio 
ibi praesentia, et praesentia flecteret ad se cogitationes illorum qui in societate, et sic turbaret influxum a Divino ibi; aliter cum abstracte cogitant de re, tunc cogitatio se diffundit undequaque 
secundum formam caelestem quam influxus procedens a Divino producit, et hoc absque ullius societatis turbatione; insinuat (t)se enim in societatum sphaeras communes, et tunc non tangit aut movet aliquem 
in societate, ita non deflectit aliquem a libero cogitandi secundum influxum a Divino; (x)verbo, cogitatio abstracta pervadere potest universum caelum absque remoratione ullibi, at cogitatio determinata 
ad personam vel ad locum figitur et sistitur. </p>
