<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第880节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>880.</strong>“他又等了七天”表重生的第二状态的开始。这一点可从以下事实清楚看出来，即正在描述的是第一状态（8:8-9）和第二状态（8:10-11）之间的间隔。为了保持历史的连贯性，间隔的时间用“等（或停）”这个字来表述。通过前面有关第一状态，也就是由于造成阻碍的虚假，信之真理尚不能扎根的状态的阐述和说明，重生的第二状态的性质在某种程度上会变得清晰起来。当一个人开始承认并相信的时候，信之真理才首次生根，而在此之前，它们没有生根。人从圣言听来并保留在记忆中的东西只不过是一粒播种的种子；在人接受和悦纳源于仁爱的良善之前，它绝不会开始生根。一切信之真理都扎根在信之良善中，即扎根在源于仁爱的良善中。这和撒在陆地上的种子极为相似。尚在冬天期间，即陆地冻硬的时候，种子其实只是撒在那里，但没有生根。不过，一旦早春太阳的热温暖这陆地，种子才第一次开始长出根来，然后向下扎入土壤中。这同样适用于被播种的属灵种子。在源于仁爱的良善使这种子温暖之前，它永远不会生根。只有这时，它才在自己里面生根，然后发出根来。<br />人里面有三样事物是一致和结合的，即属世之物，属灵之物和属天之物。属世之物只能通过属灵之物获得生命；属灵之物只能通过属天之物获得生命；而属天之物则唯独通过主，就是生命本身获得生命。为了获得更清晰的概念，让我说一下：属世之物是接受属灵之物的容器，或属灵之物被浇灌于其中的器皿；属灵之物是接受属天之物的容器，或属天之物被浇灌于其中的器皿。因此，来自主的生命正是经由属天之物流入。这就是流注的运作方式。属天之物本质上是一切信之良善；在属灵之人里面的，正是这信之良善。属灵之物是真理，并且决不会变成信之真理，除非它里面有信之良善，即源于仁爱的良善，来自主的生命本身就在这良善中。为了易于理解这个问题：正是人的属世之物将仁爱的行为付诸实践，无论通过手，还是口，因而通过身体器官。然而，这行为本身是死的，若非通过属灵之物，毫无生命可言。属灵之物若非通过属天之物，同样毫无生命可言，而属天之物则通过主拥有生命。行为由此被说成是善的，因为若非源于主，再没有良善的。<br />既如此，人人都必须明白，在一切仁爱的行为中，行为本身纯粹是身体行动，然而会通过它里面的信之真理而成为活的。而且更重要的是，信之真理是无生命之物，然而会通过信之良善成为活的。信之良善则唯独通过主，就是良善本身和生命本身而拥有生命。这就解释了为何属天的天使不愿听闻信，更不愿听闻行为的原因（参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>节），因为他们将信和行为这二者追溯到爱。他们将信归因于爱，将信所产生的行为也归因于爱。所以，对他们而言，行为和信这二者都不在他们的视线内，只保留爱及其衍生的良善，主在他们的爱中。由于这些天使拥有如此属天的观念，以致他们明显有别于被称为属灵的天使。相比属灵天使，其思维和由此而来的言谈更加妙不可言。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]880.</strong> The symbolism of he waited another seven days as the start of the second stage of regeneration can be seen from this: the clause describes the interval between the first stage (discussed just above in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_880/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_8-9" target=_top>8-9</a>) and the second (discussed here in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_880/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_10-11" target=_top>10-11</a>). To weave its story, the text uses the words he waited to stand for the interval.<br />The facts with respect to the second stage of rebirth can be seen to some extent from what was stated and shown concerning the first stage, in which religious truth could not yet put down roots because falsity was getting in the way. Religious truth first takes root when we begin to acknowledge and believe it. Until then, it has no roots. The things that we hear from the Word and hold in our memory are no more than seeds sown there.<br />Roots, however, do not develop until we receive and welcome charitable goodness. The goodness embraced by faith, that is, the good urged by charity, is what gives root to the truth taught by faith. The situation is like that of seed cast on the earth while winter still holds sway and the earth remains frozen. The seed lies there, but it does not grow roots. As soon as the warming sun of early spring thaws the ground, though, the seed begins to develop roots, at first growing them inside and then extending them into the earth. So it is with the planting of spiritual seed; no roots grow until the goodness of charity warms it. Then it first develops roots internally and afterward sends them out.<br />[2] We have three parallel, unified layers within us: earthly, spiritual, and heavenly. Our earthly level receives no life at all except from the spiritual; our spiritual level receives no life at all except from the heavenly; and our heavenly level receives life from the Lord alone, who is life itself.<br />To offer a somewhat fuller picture, our earthly level is a reservoir that holds spiritual qualities, or a container into which they are poured; and our spiritual level is a reservoir that holds heavenly qualities, or a container into which they are poured. Through our heavenly level, we receive life from the Lord. This is what influx is.{*1} The heavenly aspect is everything good connected with faith or (in a spiritual person) the goodness connected with charity. The spiritual aspect is truth, which definitely does not become a part of our faith unless it has inside it the goodness that belongs to faith, or the goodness of charity, which in turn has within it life itself from the Lord.<br />To present a still clearer view of what is entailed, our earthly dimension involves carrying out a work of charity{*2} by means of our physical body, whether in deed or word. But this dimension in itself is dead. It has no life except from the spiritual dimension lying behind the work; and the spiritual dimension has no life except from the heavenly dimension, which comes from the Lord. Because of him a deed is called good; nothing is good unless it comes from the Lord.<br />[3] This being the case, everyone can see that in any charitable deed, the act itself is just a function of the material body; whatever vitality it possesses comes from the religious truth that underlies it. Furthermore, religious truth is itself just a lifeless entity; anything alive in it comes from religious goodness. Religious goodness, again, has no life except from the Lord alone, who is goodness itself and life itself.<br />This demonstrates why heavenly angels are unwilling to hear about faith, still less about good deeds (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_880/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202" target=_top>202</a>), because they trace the origin of each to love. They act on their faith out of love, and even the good works of faith are something they do out of love, so that for them, both the works and the faith vanish and only love and the good that comes of it remain. Within their love the Lord is present.<br />Because these angels have such heavenly ideas, they are kept separate from the angels described as spiritual. Their way of thinking and consequent manner of speech is much harder to grasp than the spiritual angels' thought and speech.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the meaning of "influx" here, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_880/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657" target=_top>657</a>.

And he stayed yet other seven days. That this signifies the beginning of a second state of regeneration, may be evident from the fact that the time is thus described which intervenes between the first 
state (described in the eighth and ninth verses) and this second state (described here in the tenth and eleventh verses). In order to maintain the historic connection, this intervening time is expressed 
by his "staying." How the case is with the second state of regeneration may be seen in some degree from what has been said and shown about the first state, which was that the truths of faith could 
not yet take root, because falsities hindered. The truths of faith are first rooted when man begins to acknowledge and believe, and they are not rooted before. What man hears from the Word and holds 
in memory, is only the sowing; the rooting does by no means begin until the man accepts and receives the good of charity. All the truth of faith is rooted by the good of faith, that is, by the good of 
charity. This is as with seed that is cast into the ground while it is still winter and the ground is cold; there indeed it lies, but does not take root. But as soon as the heat of the sun warms the 
earth in the time of early spring, the seed begins first to push its root within itself, and afterwards to send it forth into the ground. The case is the same with spiritual seed that is being implanted: 
this is never rooted until the good of charity as it were warms it; then for the first time it pushes its root within itself, and afterwards sends it forth. [2] There are three things in man which 
concur and unite together, namely, the Natural, the Spiritual, and the Celestial. His natural never receives any life except from the spiritual, and the spiritual never except from the celestial, and 
the celestial from the Lord alone, who is life itself. But in order that a still fuller idea may be gained: the natural is the receptacle that receives the spiritual, or is the vessel into which the 
spiritual is poured; and the spiritual is the receptacle which receives, or is the vessel into which is poured, the celestial. Thus, through things celestial, life comes from the Lord. Such is the influx. 
The celestial is all the good of faith; in the spiritual man it is the good of charity. The spiritual is truth, which never becomes the truth of faith unless there is in it the good of faith, that 
is, the good of charity, in which there is life itself from the Lord. That a yet clearer idea may be gained: man's natural is what does the Work of Charity, by hand or by mouth, and thus by the organs 
of the body; but this work in itself is dead, and does not live except from the spiritual that is in it; and the spiritual does not live except from the celestial, which lives from the Lord. From 
this the work is said to be good, since there is nothing good except from the Lord.  [3] This being the case, it must be evident to everyone that in every work of charity the work itself is nothing 
but a material affair, and that the work is living is attributable to the truth of faith that is in it; and further that neither is the truth of faith anything but an inanimate affair, and that the truth 
of faith is living is attributable to the good of faith; moreover that the good of faith is not living except from the Lord only, who is Good itself and Life itself. This shows why the celestial angels 
are unwilling to hear about faith, and are still more unwilling to hear about work (see n. 202). For the celestial angels ascribe to love both the faith and the work, making faith to be from love, 
and making even the work of faith to be from love, so that with them both the work and the faith vanish, and there remains nothing but love and its derivative good, and within their love is the Lord. 
In consequence of having ideas so heavenly these angels are distinct from those angels who are called spiritual, their very thought (together with the speech that is derived from this thought) being 
much more incomprehensible than are the thought and the speech of the spiritual angels. </p>

That 'he waited yet another seven days' means the beginning of the second state of regeneration becomes clear from the fact that the interval between the first state, dealt with in verses 8, 9, just 
above, and this second state, dealt with here in verses 10, 11, is being described. So that things may be linked together as though they were historical events, that interval is expressed by the phrase 
'he waited'. The nature of the second state of regeneration becomes clear to some extent from what has been stated and shown concerning the first, which was a state in which truths of faith had not 
as yet been able to take root on account of the falsities that obstructed. Truths of faith first strike root when a person starts to acknowledge and believe. Till then they have not struck root. What 
a person hears from the Word and retains in the memory is no more than a sowing of the seed; in no way does rooting start until that person receives and welcomes good that stems from charity. Every truth 
of faith has its roots in the good of faith, that is, in good that stems from charity. It is just like seed that is cast on the land. While it is still winter-time, that is, when the land is frozen 
hard, there it indeed lies but does not take root. But as soon as the warmth of the sun which arrives in early spring warms up the land, the seed starts to grow roots for the first time and then to 
strike down into the soil. The same applies to spiritual seed that is sown. This never strikes root until good that stems from charity warms it up so to speak. Only then does it grow a root on itself 
which it then pushes forth. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 With man there are three things which go together and combine - the natural, the spiritual, and the celestial. His natural never acquires any life except from the spiritual; 
the spiritual never acquires any except from the celestial; and the celestial does so from the Lord alone, who is Life itself. To obtain a clearer picture of this idea, let it be said that the 
natural is the receptacle that receives, or the vessel into which the spiritual is poured; and the spiritual is the receptacle that receives, or the vessel into which the celestial is poured. Thus it 
is through celestial things that life from the Lord flows. That is how influx works. The celestial is essentially all the good of faith; with a spiritual man it exists as the good of charity. The spiritual 
is truth, which in no way becomes the truth of faith unless it has within it the good of faith, that is, good that stems from charity, in which good there is life itself from the Lord. To make 
the matter more intelligible still: it is man's natural that puts a work of charity into effect, whether by hand or by mouth, and so through the organs of the body. Yet in itself the work is dead and 
has no life except from what is spiritual within it. Nor does what is spiritual have life except from what is celestial, which has it from the Lord. This is what enables it to be called a good work, 
for nothing is good if it does not derive from the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This being so it may become clear to anyone that with every work of charity, the work regarded in itself is a purely physical action, which 
is made living however by the truth of faith lying within the work. And what is more, the truth of faith is something lifeless, which is however made alive from the good of faith. And the good of 
faith has no life except from the Lord alone, who is Good itself and Life itself. This explains why celestial angels will not hear of faith, even less of works, see <a href="202.htm">202</a>, for they trace both faith and 
works back to love. They attribute faith to love, and they attribute the works produced by faith to love. For them therefore both the works and faith leave their sight, and only love and good deriving 
from it remain. And within their love is the Lord. Because those angels have ideas so celestial they are differentiated from the angels who are called spiritual. Their very thinking and consequent speaking 
are more inconceivable by far than the thought and speech of spiritual angels . </p>

Quod 'exspectavit adhuc septem dies' significet principium secundi status regenerationis, constare exinde potest quod per hoc, tempus quod intercedit inter primum statum (de quo in vers. mox praec. 
8 et 9) {1}, et hunc secundum (de quo hic in vers. 10 et 11), describatur; tempus illud quod intercedit, ut historice connexa sint, exprimitur per quod 'exspectaverit.' Quomodo secundus status regenerationis 
se habet, constare aliquantum potest ab illis quae dicta et ostensa sunt de primo statu, qui fuit quod nondum potuerint vera fidei radicem figere, ex eo quod falsitates impedirent; tunc primum 
vera fidei radicantur quando homo incipit agnoscere et credere; prius nondum radicata sunt; quae homo audit ex Verbo et memoria tenet, non est nisi inseminatio: sed radicatio nusquam incipit nisi cum 
homo bonum charitatis accipit et recipit; omne verum fidei radicatur a bono fidei, hoc est, a bono charitatis; se habet hoc sicut semen quod injicitur terrae; tempore quando adhuc hiems est, seu quando 
terra friget, tunc ibi quidem jacet, sed non radicem agit; ut primum vero calor solis, quod fit tempore primi veris, terram calefacit, tunc incipit semen radicem in se primum agere, et dein emittere 
in terram: similiter se habet cum semine spirituali quod implantatur; hoc nusquam radicatur antequam bonum charitatis quasi calefacit illud, tunc primum in se radicem agit quam dein producit.  [2] Sunt 
tria apud hominem quae concurrunt et se uniunt, nempe naturale, spirituale, et caeleste; naturale ejus nusquam aliquam vitam accipit, nisi a spirituali, et spirituale nusquam nisi a caelesti, et caeleste 
a solo Domino, qui est ipsa Vita: sed ut adhuc plenior ejus idea capiatur, est naturale, receptaculum quod recipit, seu vas cui infunditur spirituale; et spirituale est receptaculum quod recipit, 
seu vas cui infunditur caeleste; ita per caelestia vita a Domino; talis est influxus. Caeleste est omne bonum fidei, apud hominem spiritualem est bonum charitatis; spirituale est verum, quod nusquam 
fit verum fidei nisi in illo sit bonum fidei, seu bonum charitatis, in quo est ipsa vita ex Domino: ut adhuc manifestius sciatur quomodo se habet, naturale hominis est quod faciat opus charitatis, 
hoc vel manu vel ore, sic per organa corporis; sed hoc in se est mortuum, non vivit nisi a spirituali quod in opere, et non vivit spirituale nisi a caelesti quod a Domino; inde dicitur opus bonum, nam 
nihil bonum nisi a Domino; [3] quia ita se res habet, unicuique constare potest quod in omni opere charitatis ipsum opus sit nihil nisi materiale quoddam, sed quod sit animatum, hoc habeat a vero fidei 
quod in opere; et porro quod verum fidei nec sit aliquid nisi inanimatum quoddam, sed quod sit vivum, hoc habeat a bono fidei; et quod bonum fidei non sit vivum nisi a solo Domino, Qui est ipsum Bonum 
et ipsa Vita: inde patet cur caelestes angeli non audire velint de fide, minus de opere, videatur n. 202, quia tam fidem quam opus derivant ex amore, et faciunt fidem ex amore, ipsumque opus fidei 
ex amore, sic ut iis evanescat tam opus quam fides, et remaneat solum amor et bonum inde, quorum in amore est Dominus: angeli illi quia tam caelestes ideas habent, distincti sunt ab angelis qui spirituales 
vocantur; ipsaque eorum cogitatio et loquela inde est multo incomprehensibilior cogitatione et loquela angelorum spiritualium. 	@1 Parentheses inserted.$ </p>
