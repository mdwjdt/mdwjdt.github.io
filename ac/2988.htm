<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2988节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2988.</strong>要获得对代表和对应的某种概念，只要想想属于心智，也就是属于思维和意愿的事物就可以了。这些事物通常从脸上闪耀出来，因为它们就显现在表情中；尤其是情感，内在情感从眼睛并在眼睛里面就能看出来。当脸上的部位和心智的部位行如一体时，就说它们相对应，并且就是对应；脸上的表情行代表，并且就是代表。肢体语言所表达的一切，以及肌肉所产生的一切动作也是这种情形。因为众所周知，所有这些都是人的思维和意愿的表达。身体的举止动作本身就代表了心智的事物，并且就是代表。它们相一致时，就是对应。</p>

That some idea may be formed of representations and correspondences, it is only necessary to reflect on the things of the mind, that is, of the thought and will. These things so beam forth from the face 
that they are manifest in its expression; especially is this the case with the affections, the more interior of which are seen from and in the eyes. When the things of the face act as a one with those 
of the mind, they are said to correspond, and are correspondences; and the very expressions of the face represent, and are representations. The case is similar with all that is expressed by the gestures 
of the body, and with all the acts produced by the muscles; for it is well known that all these take place according to what the man is thinking and willing. The gestures and actions themselves, 
which are of the body, represent the things of the mind, and are representations; and in that they are in agreement, they are correspondences. </p>

To gain some idea of representations and correspondences, it will do if one considers simply the things that belong to the mind, namely, thought and will. These usually shine from the face in such a 
way that they are plainly visible in its expressions. Above all else interior affections shine out of the eyes and in the eyes. When the parts of the face act as one with those of the mind they are said 
to correspond and exist as correspondences, while the actual looks on the face represent, and exist as representations. It is similar with the things that are expressed by gestures in the body, and 
also with all the movements which are effected by means of the muscles. The fact that these are expressions of what a person thinks and wills is well known. The actual gestures and movements, which belong 
to the body, represent the things which belong to the mind, and exist as representations; and when things of the body accord with things of the mind they are correspondences. </p>

Ut aliqua idea repraesentationum et correspondentiarum habeatur reflectatur modo super illa quae sunt mentis, nempe cogitationis et voluntatis haec solent e facie ita elucere ut pateant in ejus vultu, 
affectiones prae ceteris interiores ex oculis et in illis; cum illa quae sunt faciei, unum agunt cum illi quae sunt mentis, {1}dicuntur correspondere, et sunt {2}correspondentiae; et ipsi vultus faciei 
repraesentant, et sunt repraesentationes.  Similiter se habet cum illis quae fiunt per gestus in corpore, ut et cum omnibus actionibus quae per musculos producuntur; quod haec fiant secundum illa 
quae cogitat et vult homo, notum est; ipsi gestus et actiones quae sunt corporis, repraesentant illa quae sunt mentis, et sunt repraesentationes; et quod concordent, sunt {3}correspondentiae. @1 i tunc$
