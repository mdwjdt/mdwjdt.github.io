<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1624节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1624.</strong>一道巨大的彩虹被展示给我，以便我能了解其最小形式的性质。这是一道有边缘的纯白色光芒，光中心似乎是一个土质的黑暗物体。这个物体周围笼罩着极其明亮的光晕，这光晕本身斑驳陆离，并被另一个带有似小星星的金点的发光体所分割。另外的杂色则是由进入发光区域的不同颜色的鲜花产生的。这些花的颜色不是从白光发出的，而是从火焰般的光芒发出的。所有这些表象都代表了属天和属灵之物。来世所看到的一切色彩都代表属天或属灵之物。火焰似的光所发出的色彩代表那些属于爱的事物和对良善的情感，而白光所发出的色彩则代表那些属于信的事物和对真理的情感。这些就是来世一切色彩的源头，故它们如此辉煌，以致这个世界的色彩根本无法与之相比。那里还有世上从未见过的色彩。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1624.</strong> Once a large-scale rainbow appeared before me so that I could learn from it what rainbows are like at the smallest scale.{*1} There was a brilliant white light with a kind of belt about it. At the core of the belt was something dim and earthlike surrounded by a bright radiance. The radiance was dappled and broken up by another kind of light containing golden starlike sparkles. Other changes occurred when flowers of different colors entered into the bright radiance 钬?colors produced not by white light but by a fiery kind of light. All of it represented heavenly and spiritual qualities.<br />In the other world, all visible colors represent something heavenly or spiritual. Colors that partake of fire represent aspects of love and of a desire for what is good. Colors that partake of white light represent aspects of faith and of a desire for truth. All colors in the next life come from these sources and therefore gleam so brilliantly that colors in this world cannot be compared to them. There are also colors that have never been seen in the world.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The method that Swedenborg describes here 钬?of using macroscopic phenomena to determine the workings of microscopic phenomena 钬?is reminiscent of the method earlier used by Descartes and others in developing their theories of the rainbow. Descartes takes as his premise that the rainbow is formed "merely from the way the rays of light act against [raindrops]" (Descartes [1637] 2001, 332). He goes on to describe his mode of investigation in this way: "Seeing that [the raindrops'] being larger or smaller does not change the appearance of the arc, I then took it into my head to make a very large [raindrop], the better to examine it" (Descartes [1637] 2001, 332). Descartes's "very large raindrop" was a large glass globe filled with water. There is no question that Swedenborg was aware of such experiments; he probably read them in Descartes's work itself, but in any case he copied a mention of them into his commonplace book, Quotations on Various Philosophical and Theological Topics (Swedenborg 1976c), 249. This entire passage is of a piece with the Enlightenment fascination with macrocosm and microcosm and the utility of enlargement, visual and otherwise, in solving age-old riddles of the natural world. Compare the passage in Worship and Love of God 95:2-3 in which a "zoomed in" image of the inside of the body is shown by a teacher to a pupil. [SS] </p>

I saw the form of a certain large rainbow, in order that from it I might know what they are in their smallest forms. The light was the brightest white, encompassed with a sort of border or circumference, 
in the center of which there was a dimness as it were terrene, and around this it was intensely lucid, which intense lucidity was varied and intersected by another lucidity with golden points, like 
little stars; besides variegations induced by means of flowers of variegated hue, that entered into the intense lucidity. The colors of the flowers did not flow forth from a white, but from a flaming 
light. All these things were representative of things celestial and spiritual. All the colors seen in the other life represent what is celestial and spiritual; colors from flaming light, the things 
that are of love and of the affection of good; and colors from shining white light, those which are of faith and of the affection of truth. From these origins come all the colors in the other life; and 
for this reason they are so refulgent that the colors in this world cannot be compared to them. There are also colors that have never been seen in this world. </p>

The form of one of the large rainbows was shown to me, so that from it I could get to know what their smallest forms were like. It was a pure white light with a kind of border, in the middle of which 
was a dark object as if made of earth. This was surrounded by an extremely luminous halo, itself variegated and divided up by another luminescence that had yellow dots like tiny stars. Additional variegations 
were produced by flowers of different colours entering the luminous area. The colours of these flowers emanated not from a white light but from a flame-like one. All of these appearances were 
representative of celestial and spiritual things. All the colours that are seen in the next life represent that which is celestial or spiritual. The colours emanating from the flame-like light represent 
things that belong to love and the affection for good, whereas colours emanating from the white light represent those that belong to faith and the affection for truth. These are the sources of all 
colours in the next life, and they are therefore so resplendent that the colours of this world cannot compare with them. Colours also exist there which are never seen in this world. </p>

</p><b>1624.</b>
Visa mihi est forma cujusdam iridis major, ut inde scire possem quales sunt in formis suis minimis: erat lux candidissima cincta quadam circumferentia, in cujus centro obscurum quasi terrenum, circumfusum 
lucidissimo, quod lucidissimum variabatur et discriminabatur alio lucido cum punctulis flavescentibus sicut stellulis; praeter variegationes inductas per flores diversicolores intrantes in lucidissimum, 
quorum colores effluebant non a lucido candido sed a flammeo, quae omnia erant repraesentativa caelestium et spiritualium.  Omnes colores visibiles in altera vita repraesentant caeleste et spirituale; 
colores ex flammeo illa quae sunt amoris et affectionis boni; colores ex lucido candido illa quae sunt fidei et affectionis veri; ex illis originibus omnes colores in altera vita; qui ideo 
ita fulgent ut colores mundi illis aequiparari nequeant: dantur colores quoque nusquam visi in mundo. </p>
