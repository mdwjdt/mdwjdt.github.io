<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9281.</strong>“并使你婢女的儿子和寄居的都可以获得喘息”表教会之外那些处于真理和良善之人的生命状态。这从“婢女的儿子”、“寄居的”和“喘息”的含义清楚可知。“婢女的儿子”是指那些处于对外在真理的情感之人，因为“儿子”表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>节）；“婢女”表示外在情感（<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>，<a href="3835.htm">3835</a>，<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>，<a href="7780.htm">7780</a>，<a href="8993.htm">8993</a>节）。“寄居的”是指那些想要在教会的真理和良善上接受教导的人（<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="8007.htm">8007</a>，<a href="8013.htm">8013</a>，<a href="9196.htm">9196</a>节）。“婢女的儿子”和“寄居的”在此之所以表示那些在教会之外的人，是因为本节前面的话论述的是那些出生在教会的人；因此，“婢女的儿子”表示那些在教会之外的人，“寄居的”表示那些并非出生在教会的人；因为前者是劣质婚姻的后代，而后者则出身于不同的血统。“喘息”是指在信之真理和良善上的生命状态。“喘息”之所以表示这种生命状态，是因为肺的功能是呼吸，它对应于源自仁的信之生命，也就是属灵的生命（<a href="97.htm">97</a>，<a href="1119.htm">1119</a>，<a href="3351.htm">3351</a>，<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>，<a href="9229.htm">9229</a>节）。<br />人有一个外呼吸和一个内呼吸；外呼吸来自世界，内呼吸来自天堂。当一个人死亡时，外呼吸就停止了，但内呼吸仍在继续；他活在世上时，这内呼吸是无声的，没有被他察觉。这种呼吸完全靠他对真理的情感，因而靠他的信之生命来调节。那些根本没有任何信仰的人，如地狱里的人，不是从一个内在源头，而是从一个外在源头获得呼吸，因而以一个相反的方式呼吸。因此，当他们靠近一个从内在源头获得呼吸的天使社群呼吸时，他们开始窒息，变得像死亡的形像（<a href="3894.htm">3894</a>节）。结果，他们一头栽回地狱，在那里恢复以前的呼吸，这呼吸与天堂的呼吸正好相反。<br />由于呼吸对应于信之生命，所以“灵气”（anima，即灵魂或呼吸）也由于呼吸中的活力或赋予生命的能力而表示信之生命（<a href="9050.htm">9050</a>节）。因此，呼吸又被称为“灵”，如在“吸气”和“呼气”这样的词语中。因此在原文，“灵”这个词来源于“风”这个词；在圣言中，它们被比作风，如在约翰福音：<br />风随着意思吹，你听见风的响声，却不晓得从哪里来，往哪里去；凡从圣灵生的，也是如此。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.8.htm">3:8</a>）<br />由此也明显可知，经上说主复活之后，在与门徒说话时，“向他们吹一口气，对他们说，你们受圣灵”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.22.htm">20:22</a>）表示什么。</p>

And the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may take breath. That this signifies the state of life of those outside the church who are in truths and goods, is evident from the signification of "the 
son of a handmaid," as being those who are in the affection of external truth; for by "a son" is signified truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257), and by "a handmaid" is signified 
external affection (n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849, 7780, 8993); and from the signification of "a sojourner," as being those who wish to be instructed in the truths and goods of the church (n. 1463, 
8007, 8013, 9196). That by "the son of a handmaid," and "a sojourner," are here signified those who are outside the church, is because in the preceding portion of this verse those who are within the 
church were treated of; and for this reason those who are without the church are meant by the "sons of a handmaid," and those who have not been born within the church by "sojourners;" because the former 
are of a lower descent, and the latter are of a different lineage. And from the signification of "breathing," as being the state of life in respect to the truths and goods of faith. The reason why 
"breathing" signifies this state of life, is that the lungs, whose office it is to breathe, correspond to the life of faith from charity, which is spiritual life (n. 97, 1119, 3351, 3635, 3883-3896, 
9229). [2] Man has an outward and an inward breathing; the outward breathing is from the world, but the inward is from heaven. When a man dies, the outward breathing ceases; but the inward breathing, 
which during his life in the world is tacit and imperceptible to him, continues. This breathing is altogether according to the affection of truth, thus according to the life of his faith. But those 
who are in no faith, as is the case with those who are in hell, do not draw their breathing from within, but from without, thus in a contrary manner; and therefore when they approach an angelic society, 
where there is breathing from within, they begin to be suffocated, and become like images of death (n. 3894). Therefore they cast themselves down headlong into their hell, where they resume their former 
breathing, which is contrary to that of heaven. [3] As the breathing corresponds to the life of faith, therefore the life of faith is also signified by the "soul" [anima] (n. 9050), from "animation," 
which denotes the breathing; and therefore also the breath is called the "spirit," as in the expressions "drawing the breath" [spiritus], and "letting out the breath" [spiritus]. From this also 
in the original tongue, "spirits" are so called from the wind, and in the Word are compared to "the wind;" as in John: </p>
<p>     The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but 
knowest not whence it cometh, or whither it goeth: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit (John 3:8). From this also it is evident what is signified by its being said that after His resurrection 
the Lord, when speaking with His disciples, "breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). </p>

'And your female slave's son and the sojourner may draw breath' means the state of life of those governed by truths and forms of good outside the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'female slave's 
son' as those with an affection for external truth, for 'son' means truth, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="4257.htm">4257</a>, and 'a female slave' means an external affection, <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>, <a href="3835.htm">3835</a>, <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>, <a href="7780.htm">7780</a>, <a href="8993.htm">8993</a>; from the meaning of 'the sojourner' as those who wish to receive instruction in the Church's truths and forms of good, dealt with in <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="8007.htm">8007</a>, <a href="8013.htm">8013</a>, <a href="9196.htm">9196</a>, the reason why 'female 
slave's son and the sojourner' here means those outside the Church being that the preceding words in the present verse have referred to those within the Church, and therefore those outside the Church 
are meant by 'a female slave's sons' and those not born within the Church by 'sojourners' (the former are such because they are the offspring of an inferior marriage, the latter because they descend 
from an alien stock); and from the meaning of 'drawing breath' as the state of life in respect of the truths and forms of the good of faith. 'Drawing breath' means that state of life because the lungs, 
whose function is breathing, correspond to the life of faith springing from charity, which is spiritual life, <a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="1119.htm">1119</a>, <a href="3351.htm">3351</a>, <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>, <a href="9229.htm">9229</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The human being breathes outwardly and 
he breathes inwardly; outwardly he draws breath from the world, but inwardly from heaven. When a person dies he ceases to breathe outwardly, but his inward breathing, which is soundless and is undetectable 
by him while he lives in the world, continues. This breathing is regulated altogether by his affection for truth, thus by the life of his faith. Those without any faith at all, as those in hell 
are, do not draw breath from an inner source but from an outward one, thus from an opposite direction. Therefore also when they come near an angelic community, which draws breath from an inner source, 
they start to be suffocated and to become like deathmasks, <a href="3894.htm">3894</a>. As a result of this they hurl themselves headlong back into their hell, where they regain their former manner of breathing that is the 
opposite of the heavenly manner.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since breathing corresponds to the life of faith, this life is also meant by anima - a word for soul or breath, <a href="9050.htm">9050</a> - because of the animation or life-giving 
power that lies in breathing. Breathing is referred to additionally as spiritus - which also means 'spirit' - in such phrases as 'taking a breath' and 'letting out breath', and therefore also the word 
for spirits in the original language comes from a word for 'wind', and in the Word they are compared to wind, as in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its voice; but you do not know 
where it comes from, or where it goes away to. So is everyone who is born from the spirit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
From this also it is evident what the meaning is when it says that after the Resurrection, 
when the Lord spoke to the disciples, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:22</a>.

`Et respiret filius ancillae tuae, et peregrinus': quod significet statum vitae illorum qui in veris et bonis extra Ecclesiam, constat ex significatione `filii ancillae' quod sint qui in affectione veri 
externi, per `filium' enim significatur verum, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257, et per `ancillam' affectio externa, n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849, 7780, 8993, et ex significatione 
`peregrini' quod sint qui instrui volunt in veris et bonis Ecclesiae, de qua n. 1463, 8007, 8013, 9196; quod per `filium ancillae et peregrinum' hic significentur illi qui extra Ecclesiam, est 
quia in illis quae in hoc versu praecedunt, de iis qui intra Ecclesiam actum est; ideo illi qui extra Ecclesiam sunt intelliguntur per `filios ancillae,' et qui non nati intra Ecclesiam per `peregrinos,' 
quoniam illi ex inferiore toro sunt, et hi ex alia prosapia {1}; et ex significatione `respirare' illum vitae status significet, est quia pulmones, quorum est respirare, correspondent vitae fidei 
(o)ex charitate, quae est vita spiritualis, n. 97, 1119, 3351, 3635, 3883-3896, 9229. 	[2] Est homini respiratio externa et respiratio interna; externa est e mundo at interna est e caelo; cum moritur 
homo tunc respiratio externa cessat, at respiratio interna, quae est {2} tacita et imperceptibilis (o)ei cum vivit in mundo, perstat; haec respiratio est prorsus secundum affectionem veri, ita secundum 
vitam fidei ejus; qui autem in nulla fide sunt, ut sunt qui in inferno, trahunt respirationem non ab interiore sed ab exteriore, ita vice contraria, quapropter etiam illi cum appropinquant ad societatem 
{3} angelicam, (o)ubi est respiratio ab interiore, incipiunt suffocari et fieri sicut mortis simulacra, n. 3893; idcirco se dejiciunt praecipites in infernum suum, ubi iterum recipiunt respirationem 
suam priorem caeli respirationi contrariam. 	[3] Quia respiratio correspondet vitae fidei, ideo quoque vita fidei significatur per `animam,' n. 9050, ex animatione, quae est respiratio, et ideo 
quoque vocatur spiritus, prout trahere spiritum et emittere spiritum, et inde quoque spiritus in lingua originali dicti sunt a vento, et {4} in Verbo comparantur vento, ut apud Johannem, 	Ventus ubi 
vult spirat, et vocem ejus audis, atqui non scis unde venit aut quo abit; sic est omnis qui generatus est (c)ex spiritu, iii 8; </p>
