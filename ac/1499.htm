<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1499节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1499.</strong>“于是法老为了亚伯兰的事就吩咐人（他们把他送走了）”表记忆的知识离开了主。这从“法老”和“人”的含义清楚可知，“法老”表知识，“人”表属于理解力之物，如前所述（<a href="158.htm">158</a>节）。由于此处所提及的人属于“法老”或知识，所以他们表支持这种知识的理解力之物。至于记忆的知识离开主，情况是这样：当属天之物正在与智性真理结合，然后这些真理变得属天时，所有空虚的事物会自行消散。这是属天之物所具有的性质。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1499.</strong> Pharaoh gave orders concerning Abram to his men, [and they sent him away,] means that the facts the Lord knew deserted him. This can be seen from the symbolism of Pharaoh as scholarly learning and from the symbolism of men as properties of the intellect (a symbolism demonstrated earlier, at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1499/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_158" target=_top>158</a>). Here, because the men are mentioned in connection with Pharaoh, or learning, they symbolize intellectual things that are relevant to education.<br />To say more about the way the facts the Lord knew deserted him: When heavenly attributes form a bond with truth known through intuition, and that truth becomes heavenly, anything that is superfluous automatically disappears. This is an intrinsic feature of heavenly things. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1499</b></p><p><b>1499.</b>
And Pharaoh commanded the men concerning Him, [and they sent him away]. That this signifies that memory-knowledges left the Lord, is evident from the signification of "Pharaoh," as being memory-knowledge; 
and also from the signification of "men," as being intellectual things (as before shown, n. 158). "The men" here, because attributed to Pharaoh, or to memory-knowledge, signify intellectual things 
adapted thereto. As regards memory-knowledges leaving the Lord, the case is this. When celestial things are being conjoined with intellectual truths, and these are becoming celestial, then all things 
that are empty are dissipated of themselves; this is in the nature of the celestial. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1499</b></p><p><b>1499.</b>
That 'Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him, tend they sent him away]' means that facts went away from the Lord is clear from the meaning of 'Pharaoh' as knowledge, and also from the meaning of 
'men' as things belonging to the understanding, as shown already in <a href="158.htm">158</a>. Because the men referred to here are said to belong to 'Pharaoh', or knowledge, they mean such things of the understanding supporting 
such knowledge. The implication of facts going away from the Lord is as follows: When celestial things are being joined to intellectual truths and these truths are becoming celestial, all things 
that are empty disperse by themselves. This is how it is with that which is celestial. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1499</b>
</p><b>1499.</b>
Quod 'praecepit super illo Pharaoh viris, [et dimiserunt illum]' significet quod scientifica reliquerint Dominum, constat ex significatione 'Pharaonis' quod sit scientia; tum ex significatione 'virorum' 
quod sint intellectualia, ut ostensum prius n. 158; hic quia praedicantur de 'Pharaone' seu scientia, 'viri' significant adaequata.  Quod scientifica reliquerint Dominum, ita se habet: cum caelestia 
conjunguntur veris intellectualibus et haec fiunt caelestia, tunc omnia quae inania sunt, ex se dissipantur; caeleste hoc secum habet. </p>
