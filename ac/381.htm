<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>381.</strong>“种地”表培养这样的分裂或异端，这一点从前文所解释“地”的含义清楚可知。“地不再给你效力”表地的贫瘠，这一点从三个方面明显可知：首先，通过前文关于地的说明；其次，通过这些话本身的意义；最后，通过这一考虑，即坚称有信、却无仁者，根本没有信，如前所述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]381.</strong> The meaning of cultivating the ground as developing this schism or heresy is established by the symbolism of the ground, dealt with just above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_381/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_377" target=_top>377</a>]. It is evident from this, and from the words themselves, that no longer yielding its strength means being sterile. The same thing is also evident from the fact that those who profess faith without charity are professing no faith, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_381/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_379" target=_top>379</a>]. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 381</b></p><p><b>381.</b>
That to "till the ground" means to cultivate this schism or heresy, appears from the signification of "ground" of which we have just now spoken; and that its "not yielding its strength" denotes its barrenness, 
is evident both from what was said concerning ground, and from the words themselves, as well as from this consideration, that those who profess faith without charity, profess no faith, as was 
said above. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 381</b></p><p><b>381.</b>
That 'tilling the ground' means cultivating this schism or heresy is clear from the meaning of 'the ground', dealt with already just above. That 'not yielding its strength' means its being sterile is 
evident from what has just been said about 'tilling the ground' and from the very words themselves, as well as from the consideration that people who profess faith devoid of charity profess no faith 
at all, as has been stated.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 381</b>
</p><b>381.</b>
Quod 'colere humum' sit excolere hoc schisma seu hanc haeresin, constat ex significatione 'humi,' de qua mox prius; quod 'non addet dare vim suam' sit quod sterilis sit, patet inde et ex ipsis verbis; 
tum exinde quod qui profitentur fidem absque charitate, profiteantur nullam fidem, ut dictum est. </p>
