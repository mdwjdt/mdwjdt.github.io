<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3298节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3298.</strong> “她的日子满了，要生产”表效果的第一个状态。这从“日子”的含义清楚可知，“日子”是指状态（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）。效果的第一个状态由这些日子“满了，要生产”来表示，是因为就属灵之义而言，“生产”与良善并真理有关，在属灵之义上表示显化（<a href="2621.htm">2621</a>，<a href="2629.htm">2629</a>节）。良善与真理的情形与后代很相似，因为后代也是成孕，被带到子宫，出生，然后成长成熟。怀孕之后，有效的精子（即受孕的精子）开始在子宫里产生效果。一旦这些状态满了，分娩的时间就近了，这时效果开始产生，被称为效果的第一个状态。因为那时，后代开始貌似独立行动，并努力达到那被称为效果的第一个状态的状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3298</b></p><p><b>3298.</b>
And her days were fulfilled to bring forth. That this signifies the first state of the effect, is evident from the signification of "days," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788); that these 
were "fulfilled to bring forth" signifies the first state of the effect; for in the spiritual sense to "bring forth" has respect to good and truth, and in this sense means to come into existence (n. 
2621, 2629). With good and truth the case is the same as with offspring, in that they are conceived, are in the womb, are born, and afterwards grow to maturity. After conception the efficient (that 
is, the conceived seed) begins to produce the effect, which takes place in the womb; when these states have been fulfilled, and the time for bringing forth is near, then the effect commences, and is called 
the first of the effect, for then the offspring begins to act as of itself, and to exert itself to attain that very state which is called the state of the effect. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3298</b></p><p><b>3298.</b>
'Her days for bringing forth were completed' means the first state of the effect. This is clear from the meaning of 'days' as states, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>. The first state of the 
effect is meant by 'the days for bringing forth were completed' because 'bringing forth' in the spiritual sense has to do with good and truth, and means in that sense the manifestation of these, <a href="2621.htm">2621</a>, <a href="2629.htm">2629</a>. Good and truth are similar to offspring, in that they are conceived, carried in the womb, born, and after that grow to maturity. After conception the efficient, or conceived, seed starts to produce 
the effect. This takes place in the womb. Once these states have been completed and the time to give birth is at hand, the effect at that point begins to exist, which is called the first state 
of the effect. For at that point the offspring begins to act independently so to speak and to strive to reach that state which is called the state of the effect. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3298</b>
</p><b>3298.</b>
`Impleti sunt dies ejus ad pariendum': quod significet statum primum effectus, constat a significatione `dierum' quod sint status, de qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788; quod illi `impleti sint ad 
pariendum' significat statum primum effectus: `parere' enim in sensu spirituali spectat bonum et verum, et in illo sensu est existere, n. 2621, 2629: se habet cum bono et vero, sicut se habet cum prole, 
quod concipiantur, quod sint in utero, quod nascantur, dein quod adolescant; post conceptionem incohat efficiens seu conceptum semen producere effectum, hoc fit in utero; hi status cum impleti sunt 
et prope est ad pariendum, tunc incohat effectus, et vocatur primum effectus, nam tunc agere incipit proles sicut a se, et eniti ad ipsum statum qui status effectus vocatur. </p>
