<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9199.</strong>“或孤儿”表那些拥有真理，但还没有良善，却渴望良善的人。这从“孤儿”的含义清楚可知，“孤儿”是指那些拥有真理并渴望良善的人。这些人之所以由“孤儿”来表示，是因为失去父母的儿子，因而那些被剥夺内层良善和真理的人就是“孤儿”。在圣言中，“父”表示内层良善，“母”表示与该良善结合的内层真理（参看<a href="5581.htm">5581</a>节）；但“儿子”表示源自它们的真理。“儿子”表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="553.htm">553</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="6583.htm">6583</a>节）。“孤儿”在此是指儿子，不是指女儿，这一点从下面的经文（22:23）明显看出来，在那里，经上说“你们的儿子要成为孤儿”。系孤儿的儿子之所以是指那些渴望良善的人，是因为那时主取代了他们的父亲，如大卫诗篇所说的：<br />神在祂的圣所作孤儿的父，作寡妇的伸冤者。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.5.htm">68:5</a>）<br />“孤儿”是指那些在来自圣言的教会信之真理上接受教导，然后通过这些真理被引向良善的人。这一点也可从主在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：<br />我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫祂永远与你们同在，就是真理的圣灵，乃世人不能接受的，因为不见他，也不认识他；你们却认识祂，因祂与你们同在，也要在你们当中。我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。我还与你们同住的时候，已将这些话对你们说了。但保惠师，就是圣灵，祂要将一切的事指教你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.16.htm">14:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.25.htm">25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这些经文的每一个细节都清楚表明，那些拥有真理并渴望良善的人就是孤儿。“保惠师”表示神性真理，主在世时就是神性真理，并且祂荣耀了祂的人身，离开这个世界之后，这神性真理便从祂发出。所以祂才说祂要差保惠师来，并且祂自己要来。“差保惠师”表示在信之真理上光照并教导他们；“到他们这里来”表示把他们引向良善。这就是为何祂说：“我不撇下你们为孤儿”。如前所述，“保惠师”表示主在世时所是，并且祂荣耀了祂的人身并离开这个世界之后从祂发出的神性真理。主数次明确教导了这一事实；然而，那些将神性分为数个位格，而不是分成合而为一的数个本质的人并不明白这一点。因为人对圣言的解释和理解取决于他以前所接受的观念。这在主说“祂在父里面，父在祂里面；父与祂为一；凡祂所有的，都是父的，凡父所有的，都是祂的”地方（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.1.htm">14:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">16:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">17:10</a>）同样适用。<br />不过，要进一步解释一下上述这些真理。“保惠师”表示神性真理，这一点从主的这些话本身明显看出来，因为保惠师被祂称为“真理的圣灵”，祂还说“保惠师，就是圣灵，要将一切的事指教你们”。主就是祂在世时的神性真理，这一点也可从主在上述经文中的话明显看出来，因为祂说，祂要另差一位保惠师（也就是取代祂自己的另一位），就是真理的圣灵；论到祂自己，祂说，他们认识祂，因为祂与他们同住，在他们当中。祂还说：<br />我将真情告诉你们，我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差祂到你们这里来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.7.htm">16:7</a>）<br />另外一处：<br />耶稣这话是指着信祂之人要受圣灵说的。那时还没有赐下圣灵来，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.39.htm">7:39</a>）<br />祂又说“祂就是道路，真理”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）；以及“祂就是圣言，神是圣言，圣言成了肉身”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）；“圣言”是指神性真理。主在世时是神性真理（参看<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="4687.htm">4687</a>，<a href="4727.htm">4727</a>，<a href="6716.htm">6716</a>，<a href="6864.htm">6864</a>，<a href="7499.htm">7499</a>，<a href="8127.htm">8127</a>，<a href="8724.htm">8724</a>节）。<br />自主荣耀祂的人身，并离开这个世界后，神性真理就从祂发出。这一点也可从主的话明显看出来，即“我若去，就差真理的圣灵到你们这里来”，“差”表示出来并发出（<a href="2397.htm">2397</a>，<a href="4710.htm">4710</a>节）；以及祂来了，必指教你们一切真理；因为“祂不是凭自己说的，乃是把祂所听见的都说出来。祂要荣耀我，因为祂要将受于我的传达给你们” （约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.14.htm">14</a>）。当主离开这个世界时，祂的人身就变成了神性良善和神性真理（参看<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="3712.htm">3712</a>，<a href="3737.htm">3737</a>，<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>，<a href="4577.htm">4577</a>，<a href="5704.htm">5704</a>，<a href="6864.htm">6864</a>，<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>，<a href="7499.htm">7499</a>，<a href="8241.htm">8241</a>，<a href="8724.htm">8724</a>，<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>，<a href="9167.htm">9167</a>节）。自那时起，神性真理就从祂自己所是的神性良善发出，如同宇宙之光从太阳发出（<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>，<a href="5704.htm">5704</a>，<a href="7083.htm">7083</a>，<a href="8127.htm">8127</a>节）。前面所引用的章节（<a href="9194.htm">9194</a>节）可补充到这些参考资料中。</p>

And an orphan. That this signifies those who are in truth and not yet in good, and nevertheless long for good, is evident from the signification of "an orphan," as being those who are in truth and long 
for good. The reason why these are signified by "orphans," is that sons bereaved of father and mother, thus they who are deprived of interior good and truth, are "orphans;" for by "father" in the Word 
is signified interior good, and by "mother" truth conjoined with this good (see n. 5581); and by "sons" are signified the truths thence derived. (That "sons" denote truths may be seen above, n. 489, 
491, 553, 1147, 2813, 3373, 6583.) That sons are here meant by "orphans," and not daughters, is plain from the following verse, where it is said, "and your sons shall be orphans." That "orphan sons" 
denote those who long for good, is "because the Lord is then in the place of a father to them; as in David: </p>
<p>     A father of the orphans, and a judge of the widows, is God in the habitation of His 
holiness (Ps. 68:5). [2] That "orphans" denote those who have been instructed in the truths of faith of the church from the Word, and thereby are afterward led to good, is plain also from the Lord's 
words in John: </p>
<p>     I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Paraclete,* that he may abide with you to eternity, the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, for it seeth him not, neither 
knoweth him; but ye know him, for he abideth with you, and is among you. I will not leave you orphans; I will come unto you. These things have I spoken unto you while abiding with you. But the 
Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, he shall teach you all things (John 14:16-18, 25-26). [3] That those are "orphans" who are in truths and long for good can be seen here from every detail; for by "the Paraclete" 
is meant the Divine truth, which the Lord was while in the world, and which proceeded from the Lord after He had glorified His Human and had gone out of the world. Therefore He says that "He will 
send the Paraclete," and that "He Himself will come." "Sending the Paraclete" denotes enlightening and instructing in the truths of faith; and "coming to them" denotes leading into good. Therefore 
He says, "I will not leave you orphans." It has been stated that by "the Paraclete" is meant the Divine truth which the Lord was while in the world, and which proceeded from Him after He had glorified 
His Human and had gone out of the world. That this is so, the Lord several times plainly taught. But those who distinguish the Divine into Persons, and not into Essences united in one, do not apprehend 
this; for the Word is explained and apprehended by a man according to the ideas previously received by him. So also where the Lord says that "He is in the Father and the Father in Him; that the Father 
and He are one; and that all things that are His are the Father's and all things of the Father are His" (John 10:30; 14:1-11, 20; 16:15; 17:10). [4] But to proceed with the further explanation of 
the things stated above. That by "the Paraclete" is meant the Divine truth, is plain from the very words of the Lord, for he is called "the Spirit of truth," and it is also said, "the Paraclete, the 
Holy Spirit, shall teach you all things." That the Lord was the Divine truth while in the world, is plain also from the words of the Lord in the above passage, for He says that He will send another Paraclete 
(that is, in His place), even the Spirit of truth;" and of Himself He says that they know Him, because He abideth with them, and is among them. And also: </p>
<p>     I tell you the truth, if I go not 
away, the Paraclete will not come unto you; but if I go away, I will send him unto you (John 16:7). And in another passage: </p>
<p>     This spoke He of the Spirit, which they that believed in Him should 
receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39). And again He says that "He is the way, and the truth" (John 14:6); and also that "He is the Word, and that 
God is the Word, and that the Word became flesh" (John 1:1-3, 14); where "the Word" denotes the Divine truth. (That the Lord while in the world was the Divine truth, see n. 3195, 4687, 4727, 6716, 6864, 
7499, 8127, 8724.)  [5] And that the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord since He glorified His Human, and went away out of the world, is plain also from the Lord's words, "When I go away, I will 
send the Spirit of truth unto you" ("to send" denotes to go forth and to proceed, n. 2397, 4710); and also, "When he is come, he shall teach you all the truth; for he shall not speak from himself; but 
what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak. He shall glorify Me; for he shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you" (John 16:13-14). That when the Lord went away out of the world He became 
the Divine good even as to the Human, may be seen above (n. 3704, 3712, 3737, 3969, 4577, 5704, 6864, 7014, 7499, 8241, 8724, 8760, 9167); and that then, from the Divine good, which He Himself is, 
proceeds the Divine truth, even as from the sun proceeds the light of the universe (n. 3636, 3643, 3969, 5704, 7083, 8127). To these references may be added those cited above (n. 9194). * The Greek word 
Paracletos, is here and elsewhere left untranslated by Swedenborg, doubtless because there is no precise equivalent for it in Latin, as neither is there in English. Advocatus, like advocate, has too 
restricted a meaning, and so has "Comforter." "Paraclete," used as a noun, means "one who is called to us," or "summoned;" in the present passage in connection with instruction--"He shall teach you 
all things." [Reviser.] </p>

'Or orphan' means those who possess truth but not as yet good, and still have a desire for good. This is clear from the meaning of 'orphan' as those who possess truth and have a desire for good. Such 
people are meant by 'orphans' because sons bereft of father and mother, that is, those deprived of interior goodness and truth, are orphans. For 'father' in the Word means interior good, and 'mother' 
truth joined to that good, <a href="5581.htm">5581</a>; but 'sons' means truths derived from them. For the meaning of 'sons' as truths, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="6583.htm">6583</a>. The fact that sons and not daughters are meant 
here by 'orphans' is evident from verse 24 below, where it says, And your sons will be orphans. The reason why sons who are orphans are those who desire good is that the Lord then stands in place 
of their father, according to the following words in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
A father of the orphans, and a judge of the widows, is God in the habitation of His holiness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Orphans' are those who 
have received instruction in the Church's truths of faith which come from the Word, and who are then led by means of those truths to good. This is also evident from the Lord's words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will 
ask the Father to give you another Paraclete, to remain with you forever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you know Him, because He 
remains with you and is among you. I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you. These things I have spoken to you, while I remain with you; but the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, He will teach you all 
things. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:16-18,%2024-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:16-18, 24-26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Every detail of these verses makes it clear that those are 'orphans' who possess truths and have a desire for good. 'The Paraclete' is used to mean Divine Truth, 
which the Lord was when He was in the world and which has emanated from Him ever since He glorified His Human and went away from the world. Therefore He says that He will send the Paraclete and that 
He Himself will come. 'Sending the Paraclete' means enlightening and instructing them in the truths of faith, and 'coming to them' means leading them on to good. This is why He says, I will not leave 
you orphans. As has been stated, 'the Paraclete' is used to mean Divine Truth, which the Lord was when He was in the world and which has emanated from Him ever since He glorified His Human and went 
away from the world. This was something the Lord taught plainly several times; yet those who identify persons in the Godhead and not essences united into one do not grasp it. For the explanation of the 
Word and the understanding of it by a person depend on the ideas he already has. The same applies to places where the Lord says that He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him; that the Father and 
He are One; also that all that is His is the Father's, and all that is the Father's is His, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:30;%2014:1-11,%2020;%2016:15;%2017:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:30; 14:1-11, 20; 16:15; 17:11</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But let these truths stated above receive further explanation. 
 </p>
<p>The Paraclete is used to mean Divine Truth  </p>
<p>This is evident from the Lord's actual words; for the Paraclete is called 'the Spirit of truth' by Him, and also He says, 'the Paraclete, the Holy 
Spirit, will teach you all things'.  </p>
<p>The Lord was Divine Truth when He was in the world  </p>
<p>This too is evident from the Lord's words there; for He says that He will send 'another Paraclete' (that 
is, another in place of Himself), who will be the Spirit of truth, and - referring to Himself - that they know Him 'because He remains with you and is among you'. He also says, I tell you the truth. 
If I do not go away the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go away I will send Him to you, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:7</a>.

in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified'. And other places again state that He is the way and the truth, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6</a>; also that He is the Word, that God 
is the Word, and that the Word became flesh, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3, 14</a>, 'the Word' being Divine Truth.

 Divine Truth has emanated from the Lord ever since He glorified His Human and went away from the world This too is evident from the Lord's words, 'When I go away I will send 
the Spirit of truth to you' ('sending' means going out and emanating from, <a href="2397.htm">2397</a>, <a href="4710.htm">4710</a>), and also 'When He comes He will guide you into all truth;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears

`Et orphanum': quod significet qui in vero sunt et nondum in bono, et usque desiderant bonum, constat ex significatione `orphani' quod sint qui in vero et desiderant bonum; quod illi per `orphanos' significentur 
{1}, est quia filii orbati patre et matre, ita qui privati bono et vero interiore, orphani sunt, nam per `patrem' in Verbo significatur bonum interius, et per `matrem' verum conjunctum illi

non filiae, patet a vers. 23 sequente, ubi dicitur, `et filii vestri erunt orphani.'  Quod `filii orphani' sint qui desiderant bonum, est quia loco patris eorum tunc Dominus est, secundum haec apud 
Davidem, 	Pater orphanorum et judex viduarum Deus in habitaculo sanctitatis Suae, Ps lxviii 6 [A.V. 5]. 	[2] Quod `orphani' sint qui instructi sunt in veris fidei Ecclesiae {3} ex Verbo, et per illa 
dein ducuntur ad bonum, patet etiam a Domini verbis apud Johannem, 	Ego rogabo Patrem, ut alium paracletum det vobis, ut maneat vobiscum in aeternum, spiritum veritatis, quem mundus non potest accipere, 
quoniam non videt illum, neque cognoscit illum; vos autem cognoscitis illum, quia apud vos manet et inter vos est; non relinquam vos orphanos, veniam ad vos; haec locutus sum vobis, apud vos manens, 
paracletus autem spiritus sanctus, ille vos docebit omnia, xiv 16-18, 24, 25 [, 26]. 	[3] Quod illi `orphani' sint qui in veris sunt et desiderant bonum, constare potest a singulis ibi; per `paracletum' 
enim intelligitur Divinum Verum, quod fuit Dominus cum in mundo, et quod procedit a Domino postquam glorificavit Humanum Suum et abivit e mundo; ideo dicit quod missurus sit paracletum et quod 
venturus Ipse; `mittere paracletum' est illustrare et instruere in veris fidei, (c)ac `venire ad illos' est ducere in {4} bonum, ideo dicit, Non relinquam vos orphanos {5}.  Dictum est quod per `paracletum' 
intelligatur Divinum Verum, quod fuit Dominus cum in mundo, et quod procedit a Domino postquam glorificavit Humanum Suum et abivit e mundo; quod ita sit, Dominus aliquoties manifeste docuit, sed 
qui Divinum distinguunt in personas, et non in essentias unitas in uno, illi non capiunt hoc, nam Verbum secundum captas ideas ab homine explicatur et {6} comprehenditur; ita quoque ubi Dominus dicit 
quod Ipse in Patre sit et Pater in Ipso, quod Pater et Ipse Unum sint, tum quod omnia Sua Patris sint, et omnia Patris Sua, Joh. x 30, xiv 1-11 {7}, 20, xvi 15, xvii 11; sed explicentur illa (o)quae 
supra dicta sunt, ulterius. 	[4] Quod per paracletum intelligatur Divinum Verum, patet (c)ab ipsis verbis Domini, vocatur enim `spiritus veritatis,' et quoque dicitur, `Paracletus, spiritus sanctus, 
vos docebit omnia.'  Quod Dominus fuerit Divinum Verum cum in mundo, patet quoque a Domini verbis ibi, nam dicit quod paracletum alium (hoc est, loco Sui) {8} seu spiritum veritatis missurus sit; et 
de Se, quod cognoscant illum, quia apud vos {9} manet et inter vos {9} est; et quoque, `Ego veritatem vobis dico; si non abivero {10}, paracletus non veniet {11} ad vos, si vero abivero, mittam illum 
ad vos,' Joh. xvi 7; et alibi, `Hoc dixit {12} de spiritu, quem accepturi erant credentes in Ipsum; nondum enim erat spiritus sanctus, quia Jesus nondum glorificatus erat,' Joh. vii 39; et adhuc alibi, 
quod Ipse sit via et veritas, Joh. xiv 6, tum quod sit Verbum, et quod Deus sit Verbum, et quod Verbum caro factum sit, Joh. i 1-3, 14; `Verbum' est Divinum Verum; quod Dominus fuerit Divinum Verum 
cum in mundo, videatur {13} n. 3195, 4687, 4727, 6716, 6864, {14} 7499, 8127, 8724. 	[5] Et quod Divinum Verum procedat a Domino postquam glorificavit Humanum Suum et abivit e mundo, patet etiam a Domini 
verbis, `Cum abivero, mittam spiritum veritatis ad vos'; `mittere' est exire et procedere, n. 2397, 4710; et (o)quoque, `Cum venerit, docebit vos in omni veritate; non enim loquetur a seipso, (o)sed 
quaecumque audiverit, loquetur; ille Me glorificabit, quia ex Meo accipiet, et annuntiabit vobis,' Joh. xvi 7, 13-15.  (m)Quod Dominus cum e mundo abivit, factus sit Divinum Bonum etiam quoad Humanum, 
(d)videatur n. 3704, 3712, 3737, 3969, 4577, 5704, 6864, 7014, 7499, 8241, 8724, 8760, 9167, et quod tunc a Divino Bono quod Ipse {15}, procedat Divinum Verum, sicut a sole lux universi, n. 3636, 
3643, 3969, 5704, 7083, 8127; addantur his {16} quae supra n. 9194 citata sunt. @1 id per orphanos significetur$ @2 i nata seu$ @3 i , quae$ @4 ad$ @5 seu indere bonum veris, inde patet, quid orphanus$ @6
