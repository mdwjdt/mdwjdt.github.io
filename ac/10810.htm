<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10810节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10810</strong>.这时，我看见一片乌云从高处朝东方降落。在降落的过程中，它逐渐充满光，并取了一个人的形式；该形式最终被一道火光围绕，这道火光被同样颜色的小星星所环绕。主便以这种方式呈现在正与我交谈的灵人面前。祂一出现，那里的所有灵人都从四面八方聚集在一起；当他们到来时，善人与恶人就分开了，善人往右边去，恶者往左边去。他们仿佛自动立刻这么做。往右边去的灵人照其良善的品质被依次排列，往左边去的灵人照其邪恶的品质被有序排列。然后，善人被留下来在他们当中形成天堂社群，而恶人则被扔进地狱。后来，我看见这道火光降至这个星球的下部，一个相当深的深处，当时，它一度显为接近纯光亮的一道火焰，一度显为接近微暗的一道光亮，又一度显为一种微暗。我被天使告知，这种表象是因为住在该星球下部的居民当中对源于良善的真理和来自邪恶的虚假的接受，根本不是因为这道火光经历这种变化。他们还说，这个星球的下部既住有善人，也住有恶人；但他们都被分开了，好叫主通过善人统治恶人。天使补充说，善人定期被主提入天堂，那时其他人占据了他们的地方，并且这一过程不断进行。随着这道火光下降，善人以同样的方式与恶人分离，一切事物都恢复秩序。因为恶人通过各种阴谋诡计进入善人的家，并骚扰他们；这就是那次访问发生的原因。</p>

There was then seen a dim cloud toward the east descending from some height, and which as it came down gradually appeared bright, and in the human form; and finally this form was in a flaming radiance, 
around which were little stars of the same color. In this way did the Lord present Himself before the spirits with whom I was conversing. To this presence then were gathered from every side all the 
spirits who were there; and as they came the good were separated from the evil, the good to the right, and the evil to the left, and this at once as of their own accord. And those who were to the right 
were arranged in order according to the quality of their good, and those who were to the left according to the quality of their evil. Those who were good were left to form a heavenly society among 
themselves; but the evil were cast into the hells. I afterward saw that the flaming radiance descended into the lower parts of the earth there to a considerable depth, and as it did so appeared at one 
time as a flaming that verged to brightness, at another as a brightness that verged to dimness, and at another as a dimness. And I was told by the angels that this appearance is according to the reception 
of truth from good, and of falsity from evil, with those who inhabit the lower parts of that earth; and that it was not at all because that flaming radiance underwent such variations. They also 
said that the lower parts of that earth are inhabited by both the good and the evil; but that they are well separated, to the intent that the evil may be directed by the Lord by means of the good. They 
added that the good are by turns raised up by the Lord from thence, into heaven, and that others succeed in their place; and so continually. As the flaming radiance descended, the good were in the same 
way separated from the evil, and all things were reduced into order. For by various arts and cunning tricks the evil had introduced themselves there into the abodes of the good, and had infested them; 
and this was the cause of that visitation. </p>

I saw then a dark cloud over to the east coming down from a certain height. As it came down it appeared gradually to fill with light and take a human form, which at length was surrounded by a radiance, 
and this by tiny stars of the same colour. This was how the Lord made Himself present among the spirits I was talking to. At His presence there gathered together from every side all the spirits who 
were there; and as they came the good were parted from the evil, the good going to the right and the evil to the left. They did so instantly, as if of their own accord. Those to the right were arranged 
into order in accord with the character of the good present in them, and those to the left in accord with the character of the evil present in them. Those who were good were left to form a heavenly 
community among them, but the evil ones were thrown into hell. Afterwards I saw that fiery radiance descending to lower parts of the earth there, a considerable way down, when at one time it had a flaming 
appearance turning to mere brightness, then a bright appearance turning to dullness, and then a dull appearance. I was told by angels that this appearance was attributable to the reception of truth 
from good and of falsity from evil among those who inhabit the lower parts of the earth there, and not in any way at all to such changes in the actual radiance. They also said that the lower parts 
of the earth there were inhabited by both good people and evil ones, but that these were kept well apart in order that the Lord might rule the evil by means of the good. The angels added that periodically 
the good are raised to heaven by the Lord, and others then take their place, and so on unceasingly. As that radiance descended the good were set apart from the evil in a similar way, and all things 
were restored to order. For by various wiles and tricks the evil ones had got themselves into the homes of the good and molested the good; and this was why that visitation had taken place.  </p>

Visa tunc est nubes obscura versus ortum (c)ex altitudine quadam descendens, quae in descendendo apparebat {1} per gradus lucida et in humana forma, {2}tandem haec in jubare flammeo, {3}circum quod 
stellulae ejusdem coloris; sic {4}Dominus praesentem Se stitit apud spiritus cum quibus loquebar; ad praesentiam tunc congregabantur ab undique omnes spiritus qui ibi, et cum veniebant, separabantur boni 
a malis, boni ad dextrum et mali ad sinistrum, {5}et hoc ilico sicut sua sponte, et qui ad dextrum, ordinabantur secundum quale boni, et qui ad sinistrum secundum quale mali, apud illos; qui boni 
erant relicti sunt, ut societatem caelestem inter se formarent, mali autem conjecti sunt in inferna.  Postea videbam quod flammeum illud jubar descenderet in inferiora terrae ibi satis profunde, et tunc 
apparebat nunc in flammeo vergente ad lucidum, nunc in lucido vergente ad obscuram, et nunc in obscuro; et dicebatur mihi ab angelis quod apparentia illa sit secundum receptionem veri {6}a bono ac 
falsi a malo, apud illos qui inferiora terrae illius incolunt, et prorsus non quod flammeum illud jubar {7} tales varietates subiret; {8} dicebant etiam quod inferiora terrae illius incolerentur tam a 
bonis quam a malis, sed probe separati, ob causam ut mali regerentur per bonos a Domino; {9}addebant quod boni {10}per vices inde eleventur in caelum a Domino, (c)et loco illorum alii succedant, et sic 
jugiter.  {11}In descensu illo separabantur similiter boni a malis, et {12}redigebantur omnia in ordinem, mali enim per varias artes et astutias se {13}intulerunt ibi in domicilia bonorum, ac {14}infestaverunt 
illos, ob quam {15}causam illa visitatio. @1 i magis et magis$ @2 et tandem ut$ @3 circa$ @4 venit intra spiritus illos$ @5 et hoc illico absque$ @6 in bono a Domino$ @7 i, in quo
