<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6681节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6681.</strong>“埃及王召了收生婆来”表那些陷入虚假的人谋划行动对付那些拥有属世层中真正记忆知识的人。这从“召”、“埃及王”和“收生婆”的含义清楚可知：“召”在此是指谋划行动，因为召来的目的是要毁灭真理，但所谋划的行动失败，因为真理被神性保守，这一点由“收生婆敬畏神”来表示（<a href="6678.htm">6678</a>节）（此外，在来世，侵扰善人的恶人的确串通一气，我从经历得以知道这一点）；“埃及王”是指那些陷入虚假的人，如刚才所述（<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>节）；“收生婆”是指真正的记忆知识所在的属世层（<a href="4588.htm">4588</a>，<a href="6673.htm">6673</a>，<a href="6675.htm">6675</a>，<a href="6678.htm">6678</a>节）。由此明显可知，“埃及王召了收生婆来”表示那些陷入虚假的人谋划行动对付那些拥有属世层中真正记忆知识的人。</p>

And the king of Egypt called the midwives. That this signifies that they who were in falsities conspired against those who were in true memory-knowledges in the natural, is evident from the signification 
of "calling," as here being to conspire, for the reason of the call was to destroy truths, but the plot was made futile because the truths were guarded by the Divine, which is signified by the "midwives 
fearing God" (n. 6678), (moreover, the evil in the other life, who infest the good, really conspire together, as I have been given to know from experience); from the signification of "the king 
of Egypt," as being those who are in falsities (of which just above, n. 6679); and from the signification of "midwives," as being the natural wherein are true memory-knowledges (n. 4588, 6673, 6675, 
6678). Hence it is evident that by "the king of Egypt called the midwives" is signified that they who were in falsities conspired against those who were in true memory-knowledges in the natural. </p>

'And the king of Egypt called the midwives' means that those under the influence of falsities planned a course of action against those who had true factual knowledge in the natural. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'calling' here as planning a course of action, for the purpose of the calling was the destruction of truths, but the planned course of action was made to fail because the truths were 
kept safe by the Divine, meant by 'the midwives feared God', <a href="6678.htm">6678</a> (the evil in the next life who molest the good likewise plot with one another, as I have been allowed to know from experience); from the 
meaning of 'the king of Egypt' as those under the influence of falsities, dealt with just above in <a href="6679.htm">6679</a>; and from the meaning of 'the midwives as the natural where true factual knowledge resides, dealt 
with in <a href="4588.htm">4588</a>, <a href="6673.htm">6673</a>, <a href="6675.htm">6675</a>, <a href="6678.htm">6678</a>. From all this it is evident that 'the king of Egypt called the midwives' means that those under the influence of falsities planned a course of action against those 
who had true factual knowledge in the natural. </p>

`Et vocavit rex Aegypti obstetrices':  quod significet quod consilium inirent illi qui in falsis contra illos qui in veris scientificis in naturali, constat ex significatione `vocare' quod hic sit consilium 
inire, nam causa vocationis erat destruere vera, sed consilium irritum factum est quia vera a Divino custodiebantur, quod significatur per quod obstetrices timerent Deum, n. 6678; {1}re ipsa etiam 
mali in altera vita qui infestant bonos, consilium inter se ineunt, quod etiam ab experientia scire datum est; ex significatione `regis Aegypti' quod sint qui in falsis, de qua mox supra n. 6679; 
et ex significatione `obstetricum' quod sint naturale ubi vera scientifica, de qua n. (x)4588, 6673, 6675, 6678; inde patet quod per `vocavit rex Aegypti obstetrices' significetur quod consilium inirent 
illi qui in falsis contra illos qui in veris scientificis in naturali. 	@1 seipsa I$ </p>
