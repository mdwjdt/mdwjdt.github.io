And there was controversy between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock. (And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then living in the land.)<br />There was controversy between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock means that his inner self and his outer did not agree; the herders of Abram's livestock are heavenly values, while the herders of Lot's livestock are the values of the senses. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then living in the land symbolizes evil and falsity in his outer self. </p>

Verse 7. And there was strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then dwelling in the land. "There was strife between the 
herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle," signifies that the internal man and the external man did not agree; "the herdmen of Abram's cattle," are the celestial things; "the herdmen 
of Lot's cattle," are the sensuous things; "and the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then dwelling in the land," signifies evils and falsities in the external man. </p>

Verse 7 And there was strife between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then dwelling in the land. </p>
<p>'There was strife between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen' 
means that the internal man and the external did not agree, 'Abram's herdsmen' being used to mean celestial things, 'Lot's herdsmen' things of the senses. 'And the Canaanite and the Perizzite 
were then dwelling in the land' means evils and falsities in the external man. </p>

</p><b>1570.</b>
Vers. 7.  Et fuit lis inter pastores pecoris Abrami, et inter pastores pecoris Loti: et Canaanita et Perizzita tunc habitans in terra. 'Fuit lis inter pastores pecoris Abrami, et inter pastores pecoris 
Loti' significat quod internus homo et externus non concordarent; 'pastores pecoris Abrami' sunt caelestia; 'pastores pecoris Loti' sunt sensualia: 'et Canaanita et Perizzita tunc habitans in terra' 
significant mala et falsa in externo homine. </p>
