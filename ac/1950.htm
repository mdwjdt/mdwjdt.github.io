<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1950节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1950.</strong>“他的手要攻打所有人”表它要与那些不真实的事物作斗争，“所有人的手也要攻打他”表虚假会反击。这从以下事实清楚可知：如前所述，“以实玛利”表示脱离良善的理性真理。当论及该真理时，经上说“他的手要攻打所有人，所有人的手也要攻打他”，显然，这就是这些话的含义。前面说明，“亚伯兰”代表主的内在人，或也可说，代表其神性的属天和属灵之物；“以撒”代表主的内层人，或其神性的理性；而“雅各”则代表主的外层人，或其神性的属世之物。此处描述的是未与内在人或神性的属天和属灵之物融合的理性的性质。由于该理性的性质源于知识情感的生命，即源于夏甲，撒莱的埃及婢女，还由于这生命属于外在人，而外在人具有来自主母亲的遗传性，这遗传性要被争战并逐出，故此处描述的是缺乏理性良善的理性的性质。不过，主通过试探的争战和胜利谦卑下来，也就是说，苦待并征服那遗传性，并以神性良善复活祂的理性本身后，这时，其理性本身就变成“以撒”，也就是说，它由以撒来代表。以实玛利同他母亲夏甲则被逐出家门。<br />真正的理性全都由善与真构成，也就是说，由属天之物和属灵之物构成。良善，或属天之物才是它的真灵魂或真生命；真理，或属灵之物则是从这良善汲取其生命之物。理性若缺乏来自属天之善的生命，就和此处所描述的一样，也就是说，它攻打所有人，所有人也攻打它。理性良善从不攻打，无论它怎样被袭击。因为它是柔和、坚忍和顺从的，它的性质是爱与怜悯的性质。然而，尽管它不攻打，但却征服所有人。它也从不思想争斗，或胜利的荣耀。它具有这种性质是因为，它是神性，本身不会受到伤害。因为恶无法攻击善，它甚至无法留在良善所在的气场中。这气场一靠近，恶就会自行离开，向后退却。因为恶是属地狱的，而善是属天堂的。属天-属灵之物，也就是来自属天源头的真理，或源于良善的真理，其情形也差不多是这样。因为这真理是由良善所形成的真理，因此可称其为良善的形式。<br />但此处由以实玛利代表、本节所描述的脱离良善的真理则全然不同。因为它就象野驴，攻打所有人，所有人也攻打它。事实上，它几乎没别的事干，整日思想并渴望争斗。它的总体快乐或主导情感就是去征服，并且一旦征服，它就以胜利为荣耀。这就是为何它被描述为“野驴”，或生活在荒野的骡子，或不能与他人生活在一起的野生驴子。这样的生命是无善之真的生命，甚至是没有仁的信之生命。因此，当人经历重生时，诚然，这重生是通过信之真理实现的，但它同时也是通过仁之生命实现的，主会随着信之真理的增长注入仁之生命。</p>

His hand against all. That this signifies that it will wage war upon whatever is not true, and that "the hand of all against him" signifies that falsities will fight back, is evident from the fact that 
by "Ishmael," as before said, is signified rational truth separated from good; and when it is said of this truth that "its hand is against all, and the hand of all against it," it is evident that such 
is the signification of these words. It was stated above that by Abram is represented the Lord's internal man, or what is the same, His Divine celestial and spiritual; by Isaac the Lord's interior 
man, or His Divine rational; and by Jacob the Lord's exterior man, or His Divine natural. The words before us treat of the rational as it would be if not united to the internal, that is, to the Divine 
celestial and spiritual. Because this rational had its nature from the life of affection of memory-knowledges, that is, from Hagar the Egyptian, Sarai's handmaid, and because this life pertained to 
the external man, which had an hereditary nature from the Lord's mother that was to be fought against and expelled, therefore the rational is here described such as it would be if devoid of rational good. 
But after the Lord had humbled, that is, had afflicted and subjugated that hereditary nature by means of the combats of temptations and by victories, and had vivified His rational itself with Divine 
good, it then became "Isaac," that is, it is represented by Isaac; Ishmael, together with Hagar his mother, being cast out of the house.  [2] All the genuine rational consists of good and truth, 
that is, of the celestial and the spiritual. Good, or the celestial, is its very soul or life; truth, or the spiritual, is what receives its life from this. Without life from celestial good, the rational 
is such as is here described, that is, it fights against all, and all fight against it. Rational good never fights, however it is assailed; because it is mild and gentle, patient and yielding; for 
its character is that of love and mercy. Yet although it does not fight, it conquers all, nor does it ever think about combat, or glory on account of victory; and this because it is Divine, and is safe 
of itself. For no evil can attack good; it cannot even continue to exist in the sphere where good is, for when this merely approaches, evil withdraws and falls back of itself; for evil is infernal, 
and good is heavenly. Very similar is the case with the celestial spiritual, that is, with truth from a celestial origin, or with truth which is from good, for this truth is truth that is formed by good, 
so that it may be called the form of good.  [3] But truth separated from good, which is here represented by Ishmael and is described in this verse, is altogether different, being like a wild-ass, 
and fighting against all, and all against it; in fact it thinks of and breathes scarcely anything but combats; its general delectation, or reigning affection, is to conquer, and when it conquers it 
glories in the victory; on which account it is described as an "onager," or mule of the wilderness, that is, the wild-ass, which cannot be with others. Such a life is a life of truth without good, yea, 
a life of faith without charity, and therefore when a man is being regenerated, this is indeed effected by means of the truth of faith, but still at the same time by means of a life of charity, which 
the Lord insinuates in accordance with the increments of the truth of faith. </p>

'His hand will be against all' means that it will fight against those things that are not true, and 'the hand of all against him' means that falsities will fight back. This is clear from the fact that 
'Ishmael', as has been stated, means rational truth separated from good; and when it is said, referring to this truth, that 'his hand will be against all and the hand of all against him', it is clear 
that such is the meaning of these words. It has been shown above that 'Abram' represents the Lord's Internal Man, or what amounts to the same, His Divine Celestial and Spiritual; 'Isaac' the Lord's 
Interior Man, or His Divine Rational; and 'Jacob' the Lord's Exterior Man, or His Divine Natural. Described here is the nature of the rational if it were not united to the Internal Man, or Divine Celestial 
and Spiritual. Because the rational derived its nature from the life belonging to the affection for knowledge, that is, from Hagar, Sarai's Egyptian servant-girl, and because that life belonged 
to the external man and possessed a heredity from the Lord's mother which had to be fought against and cast out, the nature of the rational if devoid of rational good is therefore described. But after 
the Lord had humbled, or afflicted and subdued, that heredity by means of conflicts brought about by temptations, and by victories, and He had with Divine good brought life to the Rational itself, the 
latter at that point became Isaac, that is, it is represented by Isaac, after Ishmael has been cast out of the house together with Hagar his mother. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The whole of the genuine rational consists 
of good and truth, that is, of what is celestial and what is spiritual. Good or what is celestial is its actual soul or life, truth or what is spiritual is that which draws its life from that good. A 
rational devoid of life received from celestial good is as is described here, that is to say, it fights with all, and all fight with it. Rational good never fights, no matter how much it is assailed, 
because it is gentle and mild, long-suffering and yielding, for its nature is that of love and mercy. But although it does not fight, it nevertheless conquers all. It does not ever think of combat, nor 
does it glory in victory. It is of this nature because it is Divine and is of itself immune from harm; for no evil can assail good, indeed it cannot even remain in the sphere where good is. Just as 
soon as it approaches, evil retreats of itself and falls back; for evil is of hell, while good is of heaven. Much the same is the case with that which is celestial-spiritual, that is, with truth from 
a celestial origin, or truth that derives from good, for such truth is truth formed from good- insomuch that one may call it the form of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But truth separated from good, which is represented 
here by Ishmael and is described in this verse, is altogether different, for it is like a wild ass, fighting with all and all with it. Indeed it hardly does anything else than think about and long 
for conflict. Its general delight or ruling affection is conquest, and when it conquers, it glories in victory. This is why it is described as a wild ass, that is, as a mule living in the wilderness or 
an ass in the wild, that is unable to live with others. A life such as this is what the life of truth devoid of good is like, and indeed what the life of faith devoid of charity is like. When therefore 
a person is being regenerated the regeneration is achieved, it is true, by means of the truth of faith, yet it is being achieved at the same time by means of the life of charity which the Lord instills 
in proportion to the increases in the truths of faith. </p>

Quod `manus ejus in omnes' significet quod pugnaturum contra illa quae non vera, et `manus omnium in eum' significet quod falsa repugnatura, constat ex eo quod per `Ismaelem' significetur verum rationale 
separatum a bono, ut dictum, de quo vero cum praedicatur quod manus ejus in omnes et omnium in eum, constat quod illa significentur.  Supra indicatum [est] quod per `Abramum' repraesentetur Domini 
Internus Homo, seu quod idem, Ipsius Divinum Caeleste et Spirituale; per `Isacum' Domini Interior Homo seu Ipsius Divinum Rationale; per `Jacobum' Domini Exterior Homo seu Ipsius Divinum Naturale; 
hic agitur de rationali quale foret nisi uniretur Interno seu Divino Caelesti et Spirituali; quod rationale quia naturam traxit a vita affectionis scientiarum, hoc est, ab `Hagare Aegyptia ancilla Sarai,' 
et haec vita erat externi hominis, quae a (t)Domini matre hereditarium habuit, contra quod pugnandum et quod expellendum, ideo rationale describitur quale foret, si absque bono rationali; sed postquam 
Dominus hereditarium illud per pugnas tentationum et victorias humiliavit, seu afflixit et subjugavit, et {1} vivificavit ipsum Suum Rationale Bono Divino, tunc fit illud `Isacus,' seu repraesentatur 
per Isacum, Ismaele e domo, una cum Hagare matre ejus, ejecto.  [2] Omne rationale genuinum constat ex bono et vero, hoc est, ex caelesti spirituali; bonum seu caeleste est ipsa anima seu vita illius, 
verum seu spirituale est quod inde vitam suam accipit; rationale absque vita bono caelesti est sicut hic describitur, quod nempe pugnet contra omnes, et contra illud pugnent omnes: bonum rationale 
nusquam pugnat utcumque impugnatur, quia mite est et clemens, patiens cedens, nam est amoris et misericordiae; et tametsi non pugnat, usquam omnes vincit, nec usquam de pugna cogitat, nec de victoria 
gloriatur et hoc quia Divinum est, et tutum a se ipso, nam nullum malum potest aggredi bonum, ne quidem potest subsistere in sphaera ubi bonum cum modo approximat, malum ex se recedit et relabitur; 
nam malum est infernale, bonum est caeleste: similiter fere se habet cum caelesti spirituali, hoc est, cum vero ex caelesti origine, seu cum vero quod est ex bono, nam hoc verum est verum formatum a 
bono, sic ut dici queat forma boni; [3] sed verum separatum a bono, quod hic repraesentatur per `Ismaelem' et describitur in hoc versu, prorsus aliud est, nempe instar onagri, et pugnat contra omnes, 
et omnes contra illud, immo vix aliud cogitat et spirat quam pugnas; delectatio ejus communis, seu affectio regnans est ut vincat, et cum vincit, gloriatur de victoria, quare describitur per onagrum, 
seu mulum deserti, aut asinum silvestrem, qui non cum aliis esse potest; talis vita est vita veri absque bono, immo vita fidei absque charitate; quare cum regeneratur homo, quidem per verum fidei, sed 
usque simul per vitam charitatis, quam Dominus insinuat secundum incrementa veri fidei. @1 tum.$ </p>
