<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3091节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3091.</strong>“就急忙放低水瓶，托在手上”表接受者凭能力所实现的顺服。这从“放低”、“水瓶”和“手”的含义清楚可知：“放低”是顺服的行为；“水瓶”是指接受者（参看<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节）；“手”是指能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节）。“接受者凭能力所实现的顺服”意思是，教义、认知和记忆知识（它们就是接受者，<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节）使自己预备接受。因为一系列从属关系，从而预备接受的状态，以及因此的顺服都通过生命的最初源头，也就是主而存在。低级事物理应服侍高级事物，故必须顺服。没有它们的顺服，就没有联结。此处提到的“能力”来自真理；真理就是那使在下的事物顺服的。在圣言中，能力尤其被归于真理。因此，在内义上表示能力的“手”、“臂”和“肩”论及真理（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="1085.htm">1085</a>节）。这能力看似来自真理，而事实上，能力本身通过真理来自良善。</p>

And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand. That this signifies submission of the recipients from power,* is evident from the signification of "letting down," as being submission; from the 
signification of a "pitcher" as being a recipient (see n. 3068, 3079); and from the signification of the "hand," as being power (see n. 878). The submission of the recipients, from power, consists in 
the doctrinal things, the knowledges, and the memory-knowledges (which are the recipients, n. 3068, 3079), applying themselves.  There is a chain of subordination, thus of application, and consequently 
of submission, from the First of life, or the Lord. As the things which are in a lower place ought to serve the higher, they must be in submission; for without their submission there is no conjunction. 
The "power" here spoken of is from truth; this causes the things which are below to submit. In the Word power is especially attributed to truth; and therefore the "hands," "arms," and "shoulders" 
(by which in the internal sense powers are signified) are predicated of truth (see n. 878, 1085); and the power which appears to be from truth is itself from good, through truth. * That is, with all 
their might. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3091</b></p><p><b>3091.</b>
'And she hastened and lowered her pitcher on to her hand' means the submission of the recipients which was accomplished by power. This is clear from the meaning of 'lowering' as an act of submission, 
from the meaning of 'a pitcher' as a recipient, dealt with in <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>, and from the meaning of 'the hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>. By the description 'the submission of the recipients which was 
accomplished by power' one means that matters of doctrine, cognitions, and facts, which are recipients, <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>, place themselves ready to receive, for a chain of subordination exists and so a readiness 
to receive, and consequently a submission, from the Prime Source of life, which is the Lord. Things in a lower position in it must be submissive because they ought to be of service to what is 
higher. Without their submission no joining together takes place. The power referred to here is received from truth. Truth is what submits those things that are beneath. It is to truth especially that 
power is attributed in the Word, and so it is truth to which the hands, the arms, and also the shoulders have reference - by which in the internal sense powers are meant, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="1085.htm">1085</a>. Though it seems to 
be received from truth, power itself is in fact received from good by way of truth. </p>

</p><b>3091.</b>
`Et festinavit et demisit cadum suum super manum suam': quod significet submissionem recipientium ex potentia, constat ex significatione `demittere' quod sit submissionis; a significatione `cadi' quod 
sit recipiens, de qua n. 3068, 3079; et ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878. Submissio recipientium ex potentia est quod doctrinalia, cognitiones et scientifica, quae sunt recipientia, 
n. 3068, 3079, se applicent; est catena subordinationis, ita applicationis, proinde submissionis, a Primo Vitae, seu {1}Domino; quae in loco inferiore sunt, quia inservire debent superiori, 
in submissione erunt, absque submissione eorum non datur conjunctio: potentia, de qua hic, est a vero; hoc submittit illa quae infra sunt; vero imprimis tribuitur potentia in Verbo, ideo de vero praedicantur 
manus, {2}brachia, ut et humeri, per quae potentiae in sensu interno significantur, n. 878, 1085: et ipsa potentia est a bono, {3}per verum, quae apparet a vero. @1 Divino$ @2 i etiam$ @3
