<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第162节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>162.</strong>一切真实、公义的法则都出于属天的源头，或说出于属天之人的生命次序。整个天堂就是一属天之人，因为只有主是属天之人。主贯乎整个天堂，贯乎该属天之人，天使也因此被称为“属天的”。一切真实、公义的法则都降自属天的源头，或说属天之人的生命次序，故婚姻的法则也是以特别的方式降自属天的源头。<br />尘世的婚姻，必须源自并遵照属天的婚姻。在该婚姻中，有同一位主，同一个天堂，同一个教会，它的头是主。由此产生的法则是，婚姻必须是一夫一妻。如此，它就能象征属天的婚姻，是属天之人的一个模型。该法则不仅启示给了上古教会，也写在了他们心里。那时，一个男人只有一个妻子，组成一个家庭。但是，当他们的后代不再是内在人，却成了外在人，就开始娶多个妻子。在上古教会，他们的婚姻是属天婚姻的象征。对他们来说，夫妻之爱折射出天堂和天堂之乐。<br />后来，当教会堕落了，他们不再觉知婚姻之乐，却以娶多个妻子为乐，这是外在之乐。主将其称为“心硬”，在此背景下，摩西允许他们娶多个妻子，如主教导说：“摩西因为你们的心硬，所以写这条例给你们。但从起初创造的时候，神造人是造男造女。因此人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一个肉体。既然如此，夫妻不再是两个人，乃是一个肉体了。所以神配合的，人不可分开。”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.5.htm">10:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.9.htm">9</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]162.</strong> All laws ordaining what is true and right flow from heavenly origins, or from the structure of the inner life in a person who belongs to heaven. Heaven, taken as a whole, is a heavenly person because the Lord alone is a heavenly person. He is the totality of each and every thing in heaven and in the heavenly individual. This is how the inhabitants there come to be called heavenly.<br />Since heavenly origins or the structure of a heavenly person's life is the source from which arises every law ordaining what is true and right — most of all the law for marriage — the heavenly marriage is the source and pattern for all marriages on earth. The heavenly marriage allows for one Lord and one heaven, or one church with the Lord as head. The resulting law for marriage is that there must be one man and one wife. When there are, they represent the heavenly marriage and provide a model of the heavenly person.<br />Not only was this law revealed to the men of the earliest church, it was also written on their inner being. Consequently a man in those times had just one wife and set up one household. But when the descendants of those earliest people stopped being deep people and became shallow instead, they began to marry many wives.<br />[2] For the men of the earliest church, the love that belongs to marriage was like heaven itself and its happiness, because their marriages represented the heavenly marriage. When that church started to go downhill, they no longer found happiness in marriage love but in the enjoyment of many partners instead — a pleasure that resides in the outer self. The Lord calls this phenomenon hard-heartedness, the grounds on which Moses allowed them to marry multiple wives. As the Lord himself teaches:<br />Because of your hardness of heart Moses wrote you this commandment. From the beginning of creation, though, God made them male and female. Therefore a person shall leave his father and mother and cling to his wife, and the two will become one flesh; so they are no longer two but one flesh. What God has joined together, then, no human shall separate.

All the laws of truth and right flow from celestial beginnings, or from the order of life of the celestial man. For the whole heaven is a celestial man because the Lord alone is a celestial man, and 
as He is the all in all of heaven and the celestial man, they are thence called celestial. As every law of truth and right descends from celestial beginnings, or from the order of life of the celestial 
man, so in an especial manner does the law of marriages. It is the celestial (or heavenly) marriage from and according to which all marriages on earth must be derived; and this marriage is such that 
there is one Lord and one heaven, or one church whose head is the Lord. The law of marriages thence derived is that there shall be one husband and one wife, and when this is the case they represent the 
celestial marriage, and are an exemplar of the celestial man. This law was not only revealed to the men of the Most Ancient Church, but was also inscribed on their internal man, wherefore at that time 
a man had but one wife, and they constituted one house. But when their posterity ceased to be internal men, and became external, they married a plurality of wives. Because the men of the Most Ancient 
Church in their marriages represented the celestial marriage, conjugial love was to them a kind of heaven and heavenly happiness, but when the Church declined they had no longer any perception of 
happiness in conjugial love, but in pleasure from a number, which is a delight of the external man. This is called by the Lord "hardness of heart" on account of which they were permitted by Moses to marry 
a plurality of wives, as the Lord Himself teaches: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>For the hardness of your heart Moses wrote you this precept, but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this 
cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh; wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together 
let not man put asunder (Mark 10:5-9). </p>

All the laws of truth and right stem from celestial sources, that is, from the order of life as it exists with the celestial man; for the whole of heaven is the celestial man, because the Lord alone 
is the Celestial Man and the All of every single thing in heaven and in the celestial man. This is why they are called celestial. Since every law of truth and right comes down from heavenly sources, that 
is, from the order of life as it exists with the celestial man - above all the law that concerns marriages - the heavenly marriage ought to be the source of and pattern for all marriages on earth. 
This marriage consists of one Lord and one heaven, or one Church whose head is the Lord. The consequent law for marriages is that there must be one man (vir) and one wife. When this is the case they 
represent the heavenly marriage, and are a model of the celestial man. This law was not merely revealed to men (vir) of the Most Ancient Church, but was also inscribed on their internal man. Consequently 
a man (vir) in those times had but one wife, and they formed one house. But when their descendants fell away from being internal men and became external they began to marry several wives.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because 
the men (vir) of the Most Ancient Church by their marriages represented the heavenly marriage, conjugial love was to them like heaven and heavenly happiness. But when that Church went into decline 
they no longer perceived any happiness in conjugial love, but only in the pleasure obtained from having several wives, which is characteristic of the external man. This the Lord calls 'hardness of 
heart', on account of which Moses allowed them to marry several wives, as the Lord Himself teaches,   </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>On account of your hardness of heart Moses wrote you this commandment, but from the beginning of 
creation God made them male and female. For this reason man (homo) will leave his father and mother and cling to his wife, and the two will be as one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 
What therefore God has joined together man (homo) must not put asunder.

</p><b>162.</b>
Omnes leges veri et recti fluunt a principiis caelestibus seu ab ordine vitae caelestis hominis, nam totum caelum est caelestis homo ex eo quod Dominus Solus est Homo caelestis, estque Omne in omnibus 
et singulis caeli et caelestis hominis; inde vocantur caelestes: quia a principiis caelestibus, seu ab ordine vitae caelestis hominis, omnis lex veri et recti, principaliter lex conjugiorum, descendit; 
conjugium caeleste est ex quo et secundum quod erunt omnia conjugia in terris; quod tale est quod Unus Dominus et unum caelum, seu una Ecclesia cujus caput Dominus; conjugiorum lex inde, quod unus 
erit vir et una uxor; et cum ita est, repraesentant conjugium caeleste, et exemplar sunt caelestis hominis. Haec lex non solum revelata est viris Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, sed etiam interno eorum homini 
inscripta; quare vir tunc non nisi quam unam uxorem habuit et unam domum constituit; at cum posteri eorum interni homines desierunt esse et externi facti, tunc plures uxores ducebant. Quia Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae viri conjugiis Suis repraesentabant conjugium caeleste, amor conjugialis erat illis quasi caelum et caelestis felicitas; sed cum declinavit Ecclesia, felicitatem non amplius percipiebant 
in amore conjugiali sed in delectatione ex pluribus, quod est externi hominis; hoc a Domino vocatur durities cordis, propter quam iis a Mose permissum ut plures uxores ducerent, sicut Ipse Dominus 
docet, Propter duritiem cordis vestram scripsit Moses vobis praeceptum hoc; ab initio autem creationis masculum et feminam fecit eos Deus; propter hoc derelinquet homo patrem suum et matrem, et adhaerebit 
uxori suae, eruntque duo in carnem unam; quare non amplius sunt duo, sed una caro; quod ergo Deus conjunxit, homo non separabit, Marc. x 5-9.   </p>
