<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8426节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8426.</strong>“到了晚上，你们就知道是耶和华将你们从埃及地领出来的”表前一个状态结束时会有一个启示，即他们已经被释放。这从“晚上”、“知道”和“领出来”的含义清楚可知：“晚上”是指前一个状态的结束，如下文所述；“知道”是指被启示，因为耶和华叫人知道的，称为启示；“领出来”是指释放，如前面频繁所述，在此是指从“埃及地”所表示的侵扰中释放（<a href="7278.htm">7278</a>节）。<br />“晚上”之所以表示前一个状态的结束，是因为在来世，状态的变化就像世上一天四个时辰，即早晨、中午、晚上、黑夜或黎明，然后又是早晨。要知道，在灵界，状态永远在发生变化，凡在那里的人都经历这些变化。这是为了让他们可以不变得以完善，因为没有状态的变化，也就是没有一个接一下接踵而来的连续变化，在灵界的人不可能就变得更完美。按顺序接踵而来的状态变化就像一日四时，一年四季；它们返回时，永远不会完全一样，而是发生改变。每个状态的开始都对应于地上的早晨，在圣言中有时也由“早晨”来表示。然而，每个状态的结束都对应于晚上，同样在圣言中有时称作“晚上”。到了早晨，他们处于爱的状态；到了中午，他们处于光或真理的状态；但到了晚上，他们则在真理方面处于模糊或暗淡的状态，在良善方面则相当冷淡，因为这是一种属世之爱的快乐占主导的状态。这种快乐就是他们在晚上所获得的“鹌鹑”所表示的，而良善则是他们每天早晨所获得的“吗哪”所表示的。<br />由此明显可知，“晚上”表示什么，即所论述事物的状态的结束，因而也表示教会的一个状态的结束。关于“晚上”的含义，可参看前面的说明，即：来世有状态的变化，就像世上有时间和季节的变化（<a href="5672.htm">5672</a>，<a href="5962.htm">5962</a>，<a href="6110.htm">6110</a>节）；“晚上”表示前一个教会的结束，“早晨”表示一个新教会的开始（<a href="2323.htm">2323</a>，<a href="7844.htm">7844</a>节）；因此，“晚上和早晨”表示主的降临或到来（<a href="7844.htm">7844</a>节）；在天堂，早晨之前有晚上和黎明，但没有黑夜；黑夜出现在地狱（<a href="6110.htm">6110</a>节）。</p>

In the evening, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt. That this signifies that in the end of the former state there shall be a revelation that they are liberated, 
is evident from the signification of "evening," as being the end of the former state (of which below); from the signification of "knowing," as being to be revealed, for that which Jehovah gives to 
know is called "revelation;" and from the signification of "bringing out," as being to liberate (as frequently above), here from the infestations which are signified by "the land of Egypt" (n. 7278). 
 [2] That "in the evening" denotes the end of a former state, is because the changes of state in the other life are circumstanced as are the times of day in the world, namely, morning, noon, evening, 
and night, or twilight, and again morning. Be it known that in the spiritual world there are perpetual changes of states, and that all who are there pass through them. The reason is that they may be 
continually perfected, for without changes of states or without variations continually succeeding one another in order, they who are in the spiritual world are not perfected. The changes of states which 
succeed each other in order like the times of the day and the times of the year, never return quite the same, but are varied. The beginning of every state corresponds to morning on the earth, and also 
in the Word is sometimes meant by "morning;" but the end of every state corresponds to evening, and is likewise sometimes called "evening" in the Word. When it is morning they are in love; when it 
is noon, they are in light or in truth; but when it is evening they are in obscurity as to truths, and are in the delight of natural love. This delight is what is signified by the quail which they received 
in the evening, and the good is what is signified by the manna which they received every morning.  [3] From all this it is evident what "the evening" signifies, namely, the end of the state of 
the thing treated of, consequently also the end of the state of the church. But see what has previously been shown about the signification of "evening:" That in the other life there are alternations 
of states, as in the world there are alternations of times (n. 5672, 5962, 6110); that "evening" denotes the end of a former church, and "morning" the beginning of a new church (n. 2323, 7844); consequently 
that "the evening and the morning" denote the advent of the Lord (n. 7844); that in heaven there are evening and twilight before morning; but not night, which is in hell (n. 6110). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8426</b></p><p><b>8426.</b>
'At evening you will know that Jehovah has brought you out of the land of Egypt' means that at the end of a former state comes the revelation that they have been delivered. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'at evening' as the end of a former state, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'knowing' as being revealed, for what Jehovah causes a person to know is called revelation; and from the meaning 
of 'bringing out' as delivering, as often before, at this point from the molestations that are meant by 'the land of Egypt', <a href="7278.htm">7278</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'at evening' means the end of a former state 
is that changes of state in the next life resemble the times of day in the world, that is to say, morning, midday, evening, and night or twilight, then morning again. It should be recognized that in the 
spiritual world changes of state are forever taking place, which all who are there pass through, the purpose of it all being that they may continue unceasingly to be made more perfect. For without 
changes of states, that is, without variations constantly following one another in sequence, those who are there cannot be made more perfect. The changes of states which follow one another in sequence, 
resembling the times of day and seasons of the year, are never exactly the same when they come round again, but are varied. The beginning of each state corresponds to morning on earth, and also in the 
Word is meant several times by 'morning'. The end of each state however corresponds to evening, and is also called 'evening' several times in the Word. When it is morning they are in a state of love; 
when it is midday they are in a state of light or truth; but when it is evening they are in a state that is dim so far as truths are concerned and rather cool so far as good is concerned, since it 
is a state in which the delight belonging to natural love rules them. This delight is what is meant by 'the selav' which the people received in the evening, and good is what is meant by 'the manna' which 
they received every morning. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 All this goes to show what 'the evening' means - the end of the state of whatever the subject may be; consequently it may mean the end of a state of the Church. 
But see what has been shown already about the meaning of 'the evening': </p>
<p> In the next life there are changes of state, just as in the world there are changes of times and seasons, <a href="5672.htm">5672</a>, <a href="5962.htm">5962</a>, <a href="6110.htm">6110</a>. </p>
<p>'Evening' 
is the end of a former Church, and 'morning' the beginning of a new one, <a href="2323.htm">2323</a>, <a href="7844.htm">7844</a>; therefore 'evening, and 'morning' mean the Coming or arrival of the Lord, <a href="7844.htm">7844</a>. </p>
<p>In heaven there is 
evening and twilight before morning, but no night; night occurs in hell, <a href="6110.htm">6110</a>. </p>

`Vesperi et cognoscetis quod Jehovah eduxerit vos e terra Aegypti': quod significet quod in fine prioris status revelatio quod liberati, constat a significatione `vesperi' quod sit finis status prioris, 
de qua sequitur; (x)ex significatione `cognoscere' quod sit revelari, nam quod Jehovah dat cognoscere, hoc dicitur revelatio; et ex significatione `educere' quod sit liberare, ut prius saepe, hic 
ex {1}infestationibus quae per `terram Aegypti' significantur, n. 7278. 	2 Quod `vesperi' sit finis status prioris, est quia status mutationes in altera vita se habent sicut tempora diei in mundo, nempe 
sicut mane, meridies, vespera, et nox, seu diluculum, ac iterum mane; sciendum quod in mundo spirituali perpetuae mutationes status sint, et quod omnes qui ibi illos percurrant; causa est ut {2}jugiter 
perficiantur, nam absque statuum mutationibus seu absque variis ordine sibi {3}continue succedentibus non {4}perficiuntur qui ibi; statuum mutationes quae ordine sibi succedunt, sicut tempora diei 
et tempora anni, nusquam prorsus eadem redeunt, sed variatae; principium cujusvis status correspondet mane in terra, et quoque in Verbo aliquoties intelligitur per mane; finis autem cujusvis status 
correspondet vesperae, et dicitur quoque aliquoties in Verbo vespera; cum mane est, tunc in amore sunt, cum meridies tunc in luce seu in vero sunt, cum autem vespera est, tunc in obscuro {5} quoad vera, 
et in quodam frigore quoad bona, nam tunc in jucundo amoris naturalis sunt; hoc jucundum est quod significatur per `selav' quod acceperunt in vespera, et bonum est quod significatur per `mannam' 
quam acceperunt quovis mane. 	3 Ex his {6} constare potest quid `vespera' {7}significat, quod nempe finem status {8}rei de qua agitur; {9}inde quoque finem status Ecclesiae; sed videantur quae prius 
de significatione vesperae ostensa sunt; quod in altera vita sint vices statuum sicut in mundo vices temporum, n. 5672, 5962, 6110.  Quod `vespera' sit finis Ecclesiae prioris, et `mane' principium novae, 
n. 2323, 7844; inde quod `vespera' et `mane' sit Adventus Domini, n. 7844.  Quod in caelo sit vespera et diluculum ante mane, non autem nox, quae in inferno, n. 6110. 	@1 infestationum statu qui
