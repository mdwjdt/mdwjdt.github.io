<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4053节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4053.</strong>迄今为止，没有人知道对应关系的存在，我意识到人们一听到它们，必感到惊奇。这是因为他们不知道何为内在人，何为外在人；并且不知道内在人在灵界，外在人在尘世；也不知道正是内在人活在外在人里面，流入并主宰它。从这一事实，以及前面（<a href="4044.htm">4044</a>节）所引用的内容可知流注，以及对应的存在。在来世，它们的存在是众所周知的，以下事实也是：属世之物无非是属灵之物的代表，属世之物通过属灵之物产生并维持存在；并且属世之物对属灵之物的代表取决于它与属灵之物的对应关系。</p>

Hitherto no one has known that there are such correspondences, and I am well aware that men will marvel when they hear of them; and this because they do not know what the internal man is, and what the 
external, and that the internal man is in the spiritual world, and the external in the natural; and that it is the internal man that lives within the external, and that flows into it and directs it. 
And yet from this fact, as well as from what has been adduced above in n. 4044, it is possible to know that there is an influx, and that there is a correspondence. That such is the case is most fully 
known in the other life, and also that what is natural is nothing else than a representation of the spiritual things from which it comes forth and subsists; and that the representation by the natural 
is precisely in accordance with its correspondence. </p>

Nobody up to now has known of the existence of such correspondences, and I realize that people will marvel when they hear of them. They will do so because they do not know what the internal man is and 
what the external man is, or that the internal man exists in the spiritual world and the external in the natural, or that it is the internal man which lives within the external, flowing into it and 
governing it. From these considerations, as well as from those introduced above in <a href="4044.htm">4044</a>, it is nevertheless possible to know of the existence of influx, and also of correspondence. Their existence is 
very well known in the next life, as is the fact that the natural is nothing else than the representation of spiritual things from which it comes into being and is kept in being, and that as is the correspondence 
of natural with spiritual so is its representation of it. </p>

</p><b>4053.</b>
Quod tales correspondentiae sint, nemo hactenus novit, et scio quod miraturi cum audiunt, et hoc ex causa quia non sciunt quia internus homo et quid externus, et quod internus homo sit in spirituali 
mundo et externus in naturali, et quod internus homo sit qui vivit in externo et qui influit in hunc et regit hunc; inde, tum ex illis quae supra n. 4044 allata sunt, usque {1}sciri potest quod influxus 
sit, et quod correspondentia; quod ita sit, notissimum est in altera vita; tum quod naturale non aliud sit quam repraesentatio spiritualium, a quibus existit et subsistit; et quod naturale taliter 
repraesentet, qualiter correspondet. </p>
