And [the four] took all the resources of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went away.<br />They took all the resources of Sodom and Gomorrah means that [the hells] were stripped of the power to do evil. And all their food means that they were stripped of the power to think falsely. And went away means that this is how they were left. </p>

Verse 11. And they took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and departed. "They took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah," signifies that these were deprived of the power of doing 
evil; "and all their food," signifies that they were deprived of the power of thinking falsity; "and departed," signifies that so they were left. </p>

Verse 11 And they took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food and went their way. </p>
<p>'They took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah' means that they were stripped of the power to do 
evil. 'And all their food' means that [they were stripped of] the power to think what was false. 'And went their way' means that in this condition they were left. </p>

</p><b>1693.</b>
Vers. 11.  Et sumpserunt omnes opes Sodomae et Amora et omnem cibum eorum, et abiverunt. 'Sumpserunt omnes opes Sodomae et Amorae' significat quod deprivati potentia malum agendi: 'et omnem cibum eorum' 
significat quod potentia falsum cogitandi: 'et abiverunt' significat quod ita relicti. </p>
