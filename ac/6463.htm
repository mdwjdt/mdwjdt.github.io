<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6463节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6463.</strong>“就把脚收在床上”表（属灵良善）将自己（即将其有内层事物在其中的低层事物）转向较低属世层的良善与真理。这从“收脚”和“床”的含义清楚可知：“收脚”是指将自己转向低层事物，当“脚”表示低层事物时，“收”明显表示将自己转向，因为“脚”是指构成属世层的事物（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节），因而是指低层事物（<a href="6436.htm">6436</a>节），所表示的是有内层事物在其中的低层事物，这从前面所述（<a href="6451.htm">6451</a>节）明显看出来；“床”是指属世层（<a href="6188.htm">6188</a>，<a href="6226.htm">6226</a>节），因而是指属世层的良善与真理，因为这些构成人的属世层。所表示的，之所以是较低属世层的良善与真理，是因为根据前面所给出的解释（<a href="6451.htm">6451</a>，<a href="6452.htm">6452</a>节），内层事物将自己所转向的，就是属世层的这个部分。事实上，属世层有一个低层部分和一个高层部分，或一个内层部分和一个外层部分（参看<a href="3293.htm">3293</a>，<a href="3294.htm">3294</a>，<a href="5118.htm">5118</a>，<a href="5126.htm">5126</a>，<a href="5497.htm">5497</a>，<a href="5649.htm">5649</a>节）。<br />由于“以色列”代表来自属世层的属灵良善，“雅各”代表属世层中的属灵真理，“他的儿子们”代表分门别类的属世层中的良善与真理，故经上提及“床”，因为“床”表示属世层（<a href="6188.htm">6188</a>，<a href="6226.htm">6226</a>节）；如此处，当经上说，他与儿子们说完话时，他“就把脚收在床上”；还有，当约瑟来到他这里时，经上说“以色列就勉强在床上坐起来”（参看<a href="6226.htm">6226</a>节）；同样，他与约瑟说把葬在他列祖的坟墓之后，经上说“以色列在床头上下拜”（<a href="6188.htm">6188</a>节）。这也解释了一个值得注意的事实：当人思想雅各时，有一个人躺在上面的一张床就会出现在灵人界。这张床出现在头上的一段距离处，朝向右前方。这种表象源于以下事实：在天上，关于雅各的思维观念会转化为关于属世层的思维观念；因为在天上，他们不明白雅各是什么，只明白他所代表的东西，即属世层；而属世层也由“床”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6463</b></p><p><b>6463.</b>
And he gathered up his feet unto the bed. That this signifies as to his lower things in which were things interior, unto the good and truth of the lower natural, is evident from the signification of 
"gathering up the feet," as being to betake themselves to lower things (that "to gather" is to betake themselves, when the "feet" denote lower things, is plain; and that the "feet" denote the things of 
the natural may be seen above, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, thus things that are lower, n. 6436), that lower things in which are interior ones are meant, is evident from what was said 
above (n. 6451); and from the signification of a "bed," as being the natural (n. 6188, 6226), thus the good and truth of the natural, for these make the natural with man. That it is the good and truth 
of the lower natural, is because this natural is that to which interior things betake themselves (according to the things unfolded above, n. 6451, 6452); that the natural is lower and higher, or interior 
and exterior, see n. 3293, 3294, 5118, 5126, 5497, 5649. As by Israel is represented spiritual good from the natural, and by Jacob spiritual truth in the natural, and by his sons goods and truths 
in the natural distinguished into genera, therefore mention is made of a "bed," because by it is signified the natural (n. 6188, 6226), as here, when he had finished speaking to his sons, that "he gathered 
up his feet unto the bed;" and also when Joseph came to him, it is said that "Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed" (see n. 6226); and likewise after he had spoken with Joseph about 
burying him in the sepulcher of his fathers, it is said that "Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head" (n. 6188). And in this connection it is a remarkable fact that when Jacob is thought of, there 
appears in the world of spirits a bed with a man lying in it; this appears at a distance above the head, toward the front to the right. This appearance originates in the fact that in heaven the idea 
of thought about Jacob is turned into the idea of thought about the natural; for in heaven there is not perceived what Jacob is, but what is represented by him, namely, the natural, which also is signified 
by a bed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6463</b></p><p><b>6463.</b>
'And he gathered up his feet towards the bed' means that [spiritual good] turned itself - its lower things in which interior ones are present - towards the good and truth of the lower natural. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'gathering up the feet' as turning oneself towards lower things (when 'the feet' means lower things, 'gathering up' clearly means turning oneself towards; for 'the feet' are 
the things which compose the natural, see <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, thus which are lower ones, <a href="6436.htm">6436</a>. The fact that lower things in which interior ones are present are meant is evident 
from what was stated above in <a href="6451.htm">6451</a>); and from the meaning of 'the bed' as the natural, dealt with in <a href="6188.htm">6188</a>, <a href="6226.htm">6226</a>, thus the good and truth of the natural since these make up a person's natural. The reason 
why the good and truth of the lower natural are meant is that this part of the natural, in accordance with the explanations given in <a href="6451.htm">6451</a>, <a href="6452.htm">6452</a>, is what interior things turn themselves towards. For 
the natural has a lower part and a higher one, or an interior part and an exterior one, see <a href="3293.htm">3293</a>, <a href="3294.htm">3294</a>, <a href="5118.htm">5118</a>, <a href="5126.htm">5126</a>, <a href="5497.htm">5497</a>, <a href="5649.htm">5649</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since 'Israel' represents spiritual good from the natural, and 
'Jacob' spiritual truth in the natural, while 'his sons' represent forms of good and truths in the natural, divided into separate groups, the word bed is therefore used; for the natural is meant by it, <a href="6188.htm">6188</a>, <a href="6226.htm">6226</a>, as for example when it says here that, after he had finished speaking to his sons, he gathered up his feet towards the bed. Other examples of the usage occur where it says that, when Joseph 
came to him, Israel strengthened himself and sat on the bed, <a href="6226.htm">6226</a>, and also where it says that, after he had spoken to Joseph about burying him in the grave of his fathers, Israel bowed himself over 
the head of the bed, <a href="6188.htm">6188</a>. This also accounts for the following remarkable occurrence: When one thinks of Jacob a bed with a man lying on it is seen in the world of spirits. It is seen some distance 
away overhead, in front over on the right. The reason for its appearance is that an idea of Jacob in the mind is converted in heaven into an idea of the natural; for in heaven they do not perceive anything 
of Jacob but perceive that which is represented by him, namely the natural, which is also meant by 'the bed'. </p>

`Et collegit pedes suos ad lectum':  quod significet quoad inferiora sua in quibus interiora, ad bonum et verum naturalis inferioris, constat (c)ex significatione `colligere pedes {1}' quod sit se recipere 
ad inferiora; quod colligere sit se recipere, cum pedes sunt inferiora, patet; {2} quod `pedes' sint illa quae sunt naturalis, videatur n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, ita quae sunt 
inferiora, n. 6436; quod sint inferiora in quibus interiora, patet ab illis quae supra n. 6451 dicta sunt; et a significatione `lecti' quod sit naturale, de qua n. 6188, 6226, ita bonum et verum naturalis, 
nam illa faciunt naturale apud hominem; quod sint bonum et verum naturalis inferioris, est ex eo quod hoc {3}naturale sit ad quod interiora se recipiunt, secundum illa quae 11. 6451, 6452 explicata 
sunt; (m)quod naturale sit inferius et superius, seu interius et exterius, videatur n. 3293, 3294, 5118, 5126, 5497, 5649. [2] (n) Quia per `Israelem' repraesentatur bonum spirituale e naturali, 
et per `Jacobum' verum spirituale in naturali, et per `filios illius' (t)bona et vera in naturali distincta in genera, idcirco memoratur lectus, quia per {4}illum naturale significatur, (o)n. 6188, 6226, 
prout hic `cum absolvit loqui ad filios suos, quod collegerit pedes suos ad lectum'; tum quoque cum Joseph venit ad illum, dicitur quod `confirmaverit se Israel, et sederit super lecto' n. (x)6226; 
ut et postquam locutus est cum Josepho de sepeliendo se in sepulcro patrum suorum, dicitur quod incurvaverit se Israel super caput lecti, n. (x)6188; inde etiam quod memorabile {5}, cum cogitatur de 
Jacobo, {6}apparet in mundo spirituum lectus in quo vir cubat; hoc apparet ad distantiam supra caput versus anteriora dextrorsum; apparentia illa est inde quia idea cogitationis de Jacobo vertitur in 
caelo in ideam cogitationis de naturali, nam in caelo non percipitur quid Jacob sed id quod per illum repraesentatur, nempe naturale, quod etiam per `lectum' significatur. @1 i suos$ @2 i et$ @3
