Verses 22-26. Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one over a fountain, of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall. And embitter him, and shoot at him, and hate him, the archers. 
And he shall sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands are made strong by the hands of the mighty Jacob; from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel. By the God of thy father, and 
He shall help thee, and with Shaddai, and He shall bless thee, with blessings of heaven above, with blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings 
of thy father shall prevail above the blessings of my progenitors, even to the desire of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of the Nazirite of 
his brethren. "Joseph is the son of a fruitful one," signifies the spiritual church, in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; "the son of a fruitful one over a fountain," signifies 
fruitfulness from truth from the Word; "of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall," signifies for fighting against falsities; "and embitter him" signifies resistance by falsities; "and shoot at him," 
signifies that they fight from these falsities; "and hate him, the archers," signifies with all hostility; "and he shall sit in the strength of his bow," signifies that he is safe by means of the fighting 
truth of doctrine; "and the arms of his hands are made strong," signifies the power of the forces for fighting; "by the hands of the mighty Jacob," signifies by the omnipotence of the Lord's Divine 
Human; "from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel," signifies that from this is all the good and truth in the spiritual kingdom; "by the God of thy father, and He shall help thee," signifies 
the God of the Ancient Church; "and with Shaddai," signifies the Lord the benefactor after temptations; "and He shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above," signifies with good and truth from 
within; "with blessings of the deep that lieth beneath," signifies with the memory-knowledges that are in the natural; "with blessings of the breasts," signifies with the affections of good and truth; 
"and of the womb," signifies their conjunction; "the blessings of thy father shall prevail above the blessings of my progenitors," signifies that this church has spiritual good from the natural, not 
from the rational; "even to the desire of the everlasting hills," signifies to celestial mutual love; "they shall be on the head of Joseph," signifies these things as to the interiors; "and on the crown 
of the head of the Nazirite of his brethren," signifies as to the exteriors. </p>

Verses 22-26 The son of a fertile one is Joseph, the son of a fertile one beside a spring; daughters, [each one] marches onto the wall. And they exasperate him and shoot at him and hate him, do the archers. 
And he will sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands are made strong by the hands of the powerful Jacob - from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel - by the God of your 
father, who will help you, and together with Shaddai, who will bless you with the blessings of heaven from above, the blessings of the deep lying beneath, the blessings of the breasts and of the womb. 
The blessings of your father will prevail over the blessings of my ancestors, even as far as the desire of the everlasting hills. They will be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of the 
Nazirite among his brothers. </p>
<p>'The son of a fertile one is Joseph' means the spiritual Church, in the highest sense the Lord's Divine spiritual. 'The son of a fertile one beside a spring' means the 
fruitfulness of truth from the Word. 'Daughters, [each one] marches onto the wall' means going out to fight against falsities. 'And they exasperate him' means resistance offered by falsities. 'And shoot 
at him' means that they use those falsities to fight with. 'And hate him, do the archers' means with utter hostility. 'And he will sit in the strength of his bow' means that he is protected by the 
militancy of the truth of doctrine. 'And the arms of his hands are made strong' means the power that the forces involved in fighting possess. 'By the hands of the powerful Jacob' means received from 
the almighty power of the Lord's Divine Human. 'From there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel' means that from this springs all the goodness and truth which the spiritual kingdom possesses. 'By the 
God of your father, who will help you' means that He was the God of the Ancient Church. 'And together with Shaddai' means the Lord, bringer of benefits after temptations. 'Who will bless you with the 
blessings of heaven from above' means blessing with goodness and truth from a source within. 'The blessings of the deep lying beneath' means with factual knowledge which belongs in the natural. 'The 
blessings of the breasts' means with affections for goodness and truth. 'And of the womb' means these two joined together. 'The blessings of your father will prevail over the blessings of my ancestors' 
means that this Church will have spiritual good from the natural, but not from the rational. 'Even as far as the desire of the everlasting hills' means as far as celestial mutual love. 'They will be 
on the head of Joseph' means those things with respect to the interiors. 'And on the crown of the head of the Nazirite among his brothers' means with respect to the exteriors. </p>
