<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8418节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8418.</strong>“当天收集一天的话”表根据需要不断地。这从“收集”、“话”和“当天一天”的含义清楚可知：“收集”是指领受，当“如雨般降给”表示流入，也就是说，“如雨般降给”表示良善从神性流入时，“收集”表示领受，因为它们彼此对应；“话”是指它所论及的事物，在此是指天上的食物或吗哪；“当天一天”是指根据需要不断地。它之所以表示不断地，是因为他们天天领受吗哪，“天天”表示不断地（参看<a href="2838.htm">2838</a>节）。它之所以表示根据需要，是因为他们要根据自己每天的需要收集，不可多拿，即每人一俄梅珥。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8418</b></p><p><b>8418.</b>
And they shall gather the word of a day in its day. That this signifies continually according to need, is evident from the signification of "gathering," as being to receive, for when "raining" signifies 
the influx of good from the Divine, "gathering" signifies reception, because they correspond to each other; from the signification of "the word," as being the thing spoken of, here the bread or manna 
from heaven; and from the signification of "a day in its day," as being continually according to need. That it denotes continually is because they received it daily (that "daily" denotes continually, 
see n. 2838). And that it denotes according to need, is because they were to gather as much as they needed daily, and no more, namely, for everyone an omer. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8418</b></p><p><b>8418.</b>
'And gather the thing of a day in its day' means continually, in proportion to need. This is clear from the meaning of 'gathering' as receiving, for when 'raining' means flowing in - that is to say, 
good from the Divine flowing in - 'gathering' means receiving, because the one activity goes with the other; from the meaning of 'the thing' as the object to which it refers, in this instance the bread 
or manna from heaven; and from the meaning of 'a day in its day' as continually, in proportion to need. Continually is meant because they received the manna daily (for the meaning of 'daily' is continually, 
see <a href="2838.htm">2838</a>); and in proportion to need is meant because they were to gather as much each day as they were going to need and no more, which for each person was an omen </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8418</b>
</p><b>8418.</b>
`Et colligent verbum diei in die suo': quod significet jugiter ad necessitatem, constat ex significatione `colligere' quod sit recipere, nam cum `pluere' significat influxum, nempe boni a Divino, tunc 
`colligere' significat receptionem, quoniam sibi correspondent; ex significatione `verbi' quod (x)sit res de qua dicitur, hic panis seu manna e caelo; et ex significatione `diei in die suo' quod sit 
jugiter ad necessitatem; quod sit jugiter, est quia quotidie accipiebant; quod quotidie sit jugiter, videatur n. 2838; et quod sit ad necessitatem, est quia colligerent quantum quotidie indigerent et 
non plus, pro quolibet nempe omerem. </p>
