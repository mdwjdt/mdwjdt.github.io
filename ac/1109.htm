<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1109.</strong>彻底确信虚假信念的人会沦为完全无知，这时，他们处于朦胧和混乱的状态之中，仅仅思考自己所确认的事，内心很痛苦。不过，一段时间过后，他们仿佛重新被造，且具有信之真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1109.</strong> People who had fully confirmed themselves in misguided principles are reduced to total ignorance, and then they feel so dark and confused that when they merely think about the ideas they had confirmed themselves in, they suffer deep-seated pain.<br />When their time has finished, though, they are created anew, in a manner of speaking, and they absorb the truth that faith embraces. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1109</b></p><p><b>1109.</b>
Those who have fully confirmed themselves in false principles are reduced to complete ignorance, and then they are in obscurity and confusion, so that when they merely think of the things in which they 
have confirmed themselves, they have inward pain. But after some time has passed, they are as it were created anew, and are imbued with the truths of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1109</b></p><p><b>1109.</b>
People who have confirmed themselves completely in false assumptions are reduced to a state of total ignorance. With them things at that time are so dim and confused that when they merely think about 
the matters in which they have confirmed themselves, they experience inward pain. But after a specific time they are as it were created anew and endowed with truths of faith.  </p>

</p><b>1109.</b>
Qui se prorsus confirmarunt in principiis falsis, rediguntur in ignorantiam plenariam, et tunc iis est obscurum et confusum, adeo ut cum modo cogitant de iis in quibus se confirmarunt, intus iis dolor 
sit: at post exactum tempus, e novo quasi creantur, et imbuuntur veris fidei. </p>
