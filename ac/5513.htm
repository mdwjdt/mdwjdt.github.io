<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5513节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5513.</strong>“我们对他说，我们是诚实人，并不是奸细”表否认他们是为了利益而对教会的真理感兴趣。这从“对他说”、“诚实人”和“奸细”的含义清楚可知：“对他说”是指回答，在此是指否认；“诚实人”是指那些对本为真理的真理感兴趣的人（参看<a href="5434.htm">5434</a>，<a href="5437.htm">5437</a>，<a href="5460.htm">5460</a>节）；“奸细”是指那些为了利益而对真理感兴趣的人，在此表示他们否认是为了利益而对它们感兴趣。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5513</b></p><p><b>5513.</b>
And we said unto him, We are upright; we are no spies. That this signifies denial that they were in truths for the sake of gain, is evident from the signification of "saying unto him," as being a reply, 
here denial; and from the signification of "we are upright," as being that they were in truths which in themselves are truths (see n. 5434, 5437, 5460); and from the signification of "spies," as being 
those who are in the truths of the church for the sake of their own advantage, here meaning that it was not for this. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5513</b></p><p><b>5513.</b>
'And we said to him, We are upright men; we are not spies' means a denial that they were interested in truths for the sake of gain. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying to him' as a reply, in this 
case a denial; from the meaning of 'we are upright men' as having an interest in truths which are indeed truths, dealt with in <a href="5434.htm">5434</a>, <a href="5437.htm">5437</a>, <a href="5460.htm">5460</a>; and from the meaning of 'spies' as those interested 
in the truths known to the Church for the sake of gain. Here it is denied that gain was the reason for their interest in them. </p>

</p><b>5513.</b>
`Et diximus ad eum, Recti nos, non sumus exploratores': quod significet negativum quod in veris lucri {1} causa, constat ex significatione `dicere ad eum' quod sit responsum, hic negativum; ex significatione 
`recti nos' quod sit quod in veris quae in se vera sunt, de qua n. 5434, 5437, 5460; et ex significatione `exploratorum quod sint qui in veris Ecclesiae lucri causa; hic quod non lucri causa. @1
