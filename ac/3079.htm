<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3079节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3079.</strong>“肩头上扛着水瓶”表接受真理的器皿和维护那真理的全部努力。这从“水瓶”和“肩头”的含义清楚可知：“水瓶”是指记忆知识，因而是指真理的容器（参看<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>节）；“肩头”是指全部能力，因而是指全力以赴（参看<a href="1085.htm">1085</a>节）。就内义而言，“水瓶”或“水罐”，以及一般的器皿，均表示充当容器的事物（如与真理相关的记忆知识和认知，与良善相关的真理本身），这从圣言中的很多经文可以看出来。圣殿和祭坛的器皿没有别的含义，它们因表这类事物而被尊为圣，它们的神圣并非来自其它源头。当伯沙撒与他的一干大臣和后妃用他的父亲尼布甲尼撒从耶路撒冷殿中掠来的金银器皿饮酒，并赞美金银铜铁木石之神时，正是由于这些器皿具有这种含义，故伯沙撒的宫墙上才会显出字迹来（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.2.htm">5:2</a>等）。“金银器皿”表遭到亵渎的良善与真理的认知。因为“迦勒底人”表那些虽拥有认知，但却使这些认知被它们里面的虚假亵渎（<a href="1368.htm">1368</a>节），以致这些认知用来服务他们敬拜“金银之神”的人。因为泊沙沙撒在这一章（5:30）被称为“迦勒底人的王”。<br />“器皿”表属灵事物的外在容器，这也可从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来，如以赛亚书。<br />好像以色列人用洁净的器皿盛供物奉到耶和华的殿中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.20.htm">66:20</a>）<br />这论及主的国。“用洁净的器皿盛供物”是指相对内在人而言的外在人的代表。带来礼物者是内在人，“洁净的器皿”是指和谐一致的外在人，因此它表示存在于外在人中的事物，也就是记忆知识、认知和教义。耶利米书：<br />耶路撒冷的哀声上达，他们的贵胄打发家僮打水，他们来到池边，见没有水，就拿着空器皿蒙羞惭愧地回来了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.2.htm">14:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“空器皿”表没有真理在里面的认知，以及没有良善在里面的真理。<br />巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒吞灭我，压碎我，使我成为空虚的器皿。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.34.htm">51:34</a>）<br />“空虚的器皿”同样表空虚的认知。“巴比伦”就是那行毁灭者（参看<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>节）。摩西五经：<br />如他们安放的山谷，如河旁的园子；水要从他的桶里流出，他的种要撒在多水之处。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.6.htm">24:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这几节是巴兰关于雅各和以色列的神谕。“水要从他的桶里流出”表真理从认知中流出。<br />在十个童女的比喻中，其中有五个童女拿着灯，又预备油在器皿里，而愚拙的童女则没有（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.4.htm">25:4</a>）。“童女”表情感；“预备油在器皿里”聪明童女表真理里面有良善，因而信仰里面有仁爱。“油”表良善（参看<a href="886.htm">886</a>节）；“灯”表爱。</p>

With her pitcher upon her shoulder. That this signifies receptions of truth, and endeavor, is evident from the signification of a "pitcher," as being memory-knowledge, and thus a receptacle of truth 
(see n. 3068); and from the signification of the "shoulder," as being all power, and thus endeavor (see n. 1085). That "pitchers" or "water-jars," also vessels in general, signify in the internal sense 
things which are in the position of being a receptacle (as are memory-knowledges and knowledges in relation to truths, and as are truths themselves in relation to good), may be seen from many passages 
in the Word. The "vessels" of the temple and of the altar have no other signification, and because they signified such things they were also holy, their holiness being from no other source. [2] And 
when Belshazzar, with his great men and his wives, was drinking wine out of the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from the temple of Jerusalem, and they were praising 
the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone, it was because of such signification of the vessels that the writing then appeared on the wall of his palace (Dan. 5:2, etc.). The "vessels 
of gold and of silver" denote the knowledges of good and truth, which were profaned; for the Chaldeans denote those who are in knowledges, but such as have been profaned by the falsities that are 
in them (n. 1368); so that the knowledges serve them to worship gods of gold and silver; for Belshazzar is called king of the Chaldeans in this same chapter (verse 30). [3] That "vessels" signify the 
externals of spiritual things, is also plain from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     As the sons of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah (Isa. 66:20); </p>
<p>where 
the Lord's kingdom is treated of. The "offering in a clean vessel" is representative of the external man relatively to the internal; that which brings the gift is the internal man; the "clean vessel" 
is the external man that is in agreement, thus it denotes the things in the external man, which are memory-knowledges, knowledges, and doctrinal things. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The cry of Jerusalem 
is gone up, and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters; they came to the pits, they found no waters, they returned with their vessels empty, they are ashamed (Jer. 14:2-3); </p>
<p>"empty 
vessels" denote knowledges wherein there is no truth, and also truths wherein there is no good. Again: </p>
<p>     Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, hath devoured me, he hath troubled me, he hath made me an 
empty vessel (Jer. 51:34); </p>
<p>where an "empty vessel" has a similar meaning. That it is Babel that lays waste, may be seen above (n. 1327, at the end). In Moses: </p>
<p>     As the valleys are they planted, as 
gardens by the river's side; waters shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be at many waters (Num. 24:6-7). This is Balaam's parable concerning Jacob and Israel; "waters flowing from his buckets," 
signify that truths flow from knowledges. [5] In the parable of the ten virgins, five of whom took oil in their vessels with their lamps, while the foolish did not (Matt. 25:4), by the "virgins" 
are signified affections. That the wise "took oil in their vessels," denotes that there was good in truths, and thus charity in faith. That "oil" denotes good, may be seen above (n. 886); "lamps" 
denote love. </p>

'And her pitcher was on her shoulder' means vessels that receive truth, and a total effort to uphold that truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a pitcher' as factual knowledge, and so a receptacle 
of truth, dealt with in <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, and from the meaning of 'shoulder' as all power, and so total effort, dealt with in <a href="1085.htm">1085</a>. 'Pitchers' or water-pots, and also vessels generally, mean in the internal sense 
things that serve in the place of a receptacle, as facts and cognitions do in relation to truths, and as truths themselves do in relation to good. This becomes clear from many places in the Word. The 
temple and the altar vessels had no other meaning, and having that meaning they were also sacred. For no other reason were they sacred. That was why - when Belshazzar, along with his nobles and his 
wives, drank wine out of the vessels of gold and silver which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from the Temple in Jerusalem, and they praised the gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone 
- writing appeared on the wall of his palace, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%205:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 5:2</a> and following verses. 'The vessels of gold and silver' stands for cognitions of good and truth which were rendered profane; for 'the Chaldeans' 
means those who possess cognitions but have rendered them profane through the falsities within those cognitions, <a href="1368.htm">1368</a>, so that cognitions serve them for worshipping 'the gods of gold and silver' (Belshazzar 
being called 'king of the Chaldeans' in verse 30 of that same chapter). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'vessels' means the external containers of spiritual things is also evident from other places in the Word, 
as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Even as the children of Israel bring their gift in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom. 'A gift in a clean vessel' is a representative 
of the external man in relation to the internal. The one who brings the gift is the internal man, 'the clean vessel' a compatible external man, and so the things present in the external man, which 
are facts, cognitions, and matters of doctrine. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The cry of Jerusalem went up, and the nobles sent their inferiors to the waters; they came to the pits, they found no water, they returned 
with their vessels empty, they were ashamed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Empty vessels' stands for cognitions with no truth in them, and also truths with no good in them. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Nebuchadnezzar 
king of Babel has devoured me, he has troubled me, he has made me an empty vessel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'An empty vessel' stands in like manner for empty cognitions - 'Babel' being one who lays waste, 
see <a href="1327.htm">1327</a> (end). In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Like valleys that are planted, like gardens beside a river. Waters will flow from buckets, and his seed will be towards many waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These verses belong 
to Balaam's oracle concerning Jacob and Israel. 'Waters will flow from buckets' stands for truths flowing from cognitions. In the parable about the ten virgins it is said that five of them took oil in 
their vessels together with their lamps, but that the foolish did not, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:4</a>. 'Virgins' means affections; 'the wise took oil in their vessels' means that they took good within truths, and so charity 
within faith. 'Oil' is good, see <a href="886.htm">886</a>; 'lamps' stands for love. </p>

`Et cadus ejus super humero ejus': quod significet receptiones veri, et connisum, constat a significatione `cadi' quod sit scientificum, ita receptaculum veri, de qua n. 3068; et a significatione `humeri' 
quod sit omnis potentia, ita connisus, de qua n. 1085: quod `cadi' seu hydriae, tum vasa in communi in sensu interno significent illa quae receptaculi loco sunt, ut sunt scientifica (c)et cognitiones 
respective ad vera, ac ipsa vera respective ad bonum, constare potest a pluribus locis in Verbo; vasa templi et altaris nec aliud significarunt, et quia illa significabant, etiam sancta fuerunt; 
non aliunde fuit illis sanctum; inde erat,           Cum Belshazzar cum magnatibus et uxoribus biberet vinum ex vasis auri et argenti, quae Nebuchadnezzar pater ejus e Templo Hierosolymae eduxerat, 
et laudarent deos auri, argenti, aeris, ferri, ligni, lapidis, quod tunc scriptura in pariete palatii ejus apparuerit, Dan. v 2 seq.; </p>
<p>`vasa auri et argenti' pro cognitionibus boni et veri, quae 
profanatae, sunt enim `Chaldaei' qui in cognitionibus, sed quae profanatae sunt per falsa quae inibi, n. 1368, sic ut cognitiones illis inserviant pro colendis diis auri et argenti, Belshazzar enim vocatur 
rex Chaldaeus, ibid. vers. 30.  [2] Quod `vasa' significent spiritualium externa, etiam patet ab aliis locis in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam,           Quemadmodum adducunt filii Israelis munus in vase 
mundo      domum Jehovae, (x)lxvi 20; </p>
<p>ubi de regno Domini; `munus in vase mundo' est repraesentativum externi hominis respective ad internum; `qui munus adducit' est internus, `vas mundum' est externus 
concordans, ita quae in externo, quae sunt scientifica, cognitiones, doctrinalia: apud Jeremiam,           Clamor Hierosolymae ascendit, et magnates miserunt       minorennes ad aquas, venerunt 
{1}ad foveas, non invenerunt      aquas, reversi sunt vasis eorum vacuis, pudefacti sunt, xiv 2,      3; </p>
<p>`vasa vacua' pro cognitionibus in quibus non verum, et quoque vera in quibus non bonum: apud 
eundem,           Comedit me, perturbavit me Nebuchadnezzar rex Babelis,      constituat me vas vacuum, li 34; </p>
<p>`vas vacuum' pro similibus; quod `Babel' sit quae vastat, videatur n. 1327 f.: apud 
Mosen,           Sicut valles plantantur, sicut horti juxta      fluvium,...defluent aquae e situlis, et semen ejus ad aquas      multas, Num. xxiv 6, 7; </p>
<p>Bileami enuntiatum de Jacobo et Israele; 
`defluent aquae e situlis' pro quod vera ex cognitionibus: in parabola de decem virginibus,           Quarum quinque oleum in vasis suis cum lampadibus       acceperunt; stultae vero non, Matth. xxv 
4; </p>
<p>per `virgines' significantur affectiones; quod `prudentes acceperint oleum in vasis suis' est quod bonum in veris, ita quod charitatem in fide; quod `oleum' sit bonum, videatur n. 886, `lampades' 
pro amore. @1 super$ </p>
