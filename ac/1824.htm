<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1824节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1824.</strong>“母牛犊”表外在属天事物的代表物，“母山羊”表内在属天事物的代表物，“公绵羊”表属灵-属天事物的代表物。这从这些祭物清楚可知。属天之物，以及属灵-属天之物有外在和内在之分。外在属天之物是指属于外在人的那类事物，内在属天之物是指属于内在人的那类事物，而属灵-属天之物则是指源于外在和内在属天之物的那类事物。属天之物本身是对主之爱和对邻之爱，是从主流入的，事实上，它经由内在人流入外在人。在内在人中，该属天之物被称为内在属天之物；而在外在人中，则被称为外在属天之物。外在属天之物是指对良善的一切情感，甚至也是源于该情感的一切乐趣。只要这二者，就是对良善的情感及源于它的乐趣有爱与仁之善在其中，它们就有属天之物，以及幸福在其中。但属灵-属天之物则是含有对良善的情感的对真理的一切情感，或由对良善的情感所产生的对真理的情感。因此，它是含有仁的信，或由仁所生的信。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1824.</strong> A heifer means items that serve to represent the more superficial heavenly aspects; a she-goat, those that represent the deeper ones; and a ram, those that represent the heavenly-spiritual aspects. This can be seen from the sacrifices, which will be discussed later where they are the focus, the Lord in his divine mercy willing [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2180#subsection-2-2" target=_top>2180:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2830" target=_top>2830</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3519" target=_top>3519</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9391" target=_top>9391</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10042" target=_top>10042</a>].<br />There are heavenly qualities that are relatively superficial and ones that are relatively deep; there are also heavenly qualities that are spiritual. The more superficial heavenly qualities are those that belong to the outer self; the deeper ones are those that belong to the inner self; and the spiritual ones are offshoots.{*1} Heavenliness itself is love for the Lord and for our neighbor. This heavenly influence flows from the Lord through the inner self into the outer. In the inner self, it is called the heavenly core; in the outer self, it is called the heavenly surface. The heavenly surface is formed of every desire for what is good; in fact it includes every form of sensual pleasure produced by that desire. So far as both of these — desire for what is good, and the resulting pleasures — contain a loving, charitable goodness, they contain what is heavenly and happy.<br />The spiritual side of heavenliness, however, is every desire for truth that contains within it the desire for what is good. In other words, it is a desire for truth generated by a desire for what is good. So it is faith that contains charity, or faith generated by charity.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The expected conclusion of the sequence "The more superficial heavenly qualities are those that belong to the outer self; the deeper ones are those that belong to the inner self" would be "heavenly qualities that are spiritual are between the outer and inner self." This order is in fact implied in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1824/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1827" target=_top>1827</a>. [LHC] </p>

That "a heifer" signifies the representatives of exterior celestial things, "a she-goat" the representatives of interior celestial things, and "a ram" those of spiritual celestial things, may be seen 
from the sacrifices, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter, where the sacrifices are treated of. There are exterior celestial things, and interior celestial things, as well as spiritual 
celestial things. Exterior celestial things are those which are of the external man, interior celestial things are those which are of the internal man, and spiritual celestial things are those which 
are derived from these. The celestial itself is love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor. This celestial flows in from the Lord, and in fact through the internal man into the external. In the 
interior man this is called the interior celestial; in the external man the exterior celestial. The exterior celestial is all affection of good; nay, it is also all the pleasure which comes from the affection 
of good. So far as the good of love and of charity is in these, that is, in the affection of good and in the pleasure derived from it, so far the celestial is in them, and also happiness. But 
the spiritual celestial is all the affection of truth in which there is the affection of good, or the affection of truth which is begotten by the affection of good; thus it is faith in which is charity, 
or faith which is begotten by charity. </p>

That 'a heifer' means those things that are the representatives of exterior celestial things, 'a she-goat' those that are the representatives of interior celestial, and 'a ram' those that are the representatives 
of spiritual-celestial, becomes clear from the sacrifices, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on when sacrifices are the subject. There are exterior celestial things 
and interior celestial things, as well as spiritual-celestial. Exterior celestial things are such as belong to the external man, interior celestial such as belong to the internal man, while spiritual-celestial 
are such as derive from both exterior and interior celestial things. The celestial itself consists in love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. That celestial flows in from the Lord, 
and indeed by way of the internal man into the external. In the interior man it is called the interior celestial, in the exterior the exterior celestial. The exterior celestial consists of every affection 
for good, and also indeed every pleasure which springs from the affection for good. Insofar as these two, that is, the affection for good and the pleasure springing from it, have the good of love 
and charity within them, they have what is celestial within them, and happiness too: The spiritual-celestial however consists of every affection for truth which has within it the affection for good, 
that is, the affection for truth which is begotten by the affection for good; thus it is faith that has charity within it, or faith which is begotten by charity. </p>

Quod 'vitula' significet illa quae sunt repraesentativa caelestium exteriorum, 'capra' illa quae sunt caelestium interiorum, et 'aries' illa quae sunt caelestium spiritualium, constare potest a sacrificiis, 
de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus ubi de sacrificiis.  Sunt caelestia exteriora et caelestia interiora, tum caelestia spiritualia; caelestia exteriora sunt quae sunt externi 
hominis, caelestia interiora sunt quae interni, caelestia spiritualia sunt quae inde; ipsum caeleste est amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum; caeleste hoc influit a Domino, et quidem per internum 
hominem in externum; in interiore homine dicitur hoc caeleste interius, in exteriore caeleste exterius; caeleste exterius est omnis affectio boni, immo etiam est omnis voluptas quae ab affectione boni; 
quantam in illa et in hac, hoc est, in affectione boni et voluptate inde, est bonum amoris et charitatis, tantum est caeleste et tantum est felix: caeleste autem spirituale est omnis affectio veri 
in qua affectio boni, seu affectio veri quae generatur ex affectione boni; ita est fides in qua charitas, seu fides quae generatur a charitate. </p>
