<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7381节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7381.</strong>“你对亚伦说”表内在律法进入外在律法的流注。这从“摩西”和“亚伦”的代表，以及“说”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指神之律法；“亚伦”是指良善与真理的教义（<a href="6998.htm">6998</a>，<a href="7089.htm">7089</a>节），“亚伦”所代表的良善与真理的教义无非是从内在律法发出，也就是说，经由内在律法从神性发出的外在律法；“说”是指流注（<a href="6152.htm">6152</a>，<a href="6291.htm">6291</a>，<a href="7291.htm">7291</a>节）。“说”在此之所以表示流注，是因为摩西要“对亚伦说”，而“摩西”是指内在律法，“亚伦”是指外在律法，来自神性的流注通过内在进入外在。内在律法是诸如存在于天上的那种神之真理本身，而外在律法是诸如存在于地上的那种神之真理。因此，内在律法是适合天使的真理，外在律法是适合世人的真理。<br />由于摩西所代表的内在律法是适合天使的真理，亚伦所代表的外在律法是适合世人的真理，所以我在此说一说它们。适合天使的真理绝大部分是世人所理解不了的，这从以下事实明显看出来：天上所看见、谈论的事物是眼睛未曾看见、耳朵未曾听见的那种。原因在于，天使中间所谈论的事物都是从属世事物中抽象出来，从而远离属于人类言语的观念和话语的属灵事物。因为世人的观念是从自然界，尤其较为粗糙的自然界中的事物形成的，也就是从他在世界和地上所看见，并通过感官所接触的事物形成的，而这些事物都是物质的。世人的内层观念虽在物质事物之上，然而却仍建立在物质事物之上；观念建于其上的那个层面是它们看似存在所在的那个层面。这就是人感知他所思想的事物所在的那个层面。由此可见信之真理是何情形，以及进入世人的思维范畴，被称为外在律法并由“亚伦”来代表的事物是何性质。<br />举例说明这一点，人离开时空的观念根本不能思考；这类观念几乎粘附于他思考的每一个细节。如果时空所形成的观念从人那里被夺走，他就不知道自己在思考什么，几乎不知道他是不是在思考。然而，天使的观念没有丝毫时空之物在里面，取而代之的是状态；这是因为，自然界因时间和空间而不同于灵界。时间和空间之所以存在于自然界，而取代它们的状态存在于灵界，是因为在自然界，太阳看似通过表面的旋转产生日子和年份，并将一日分为四时，即夜、晨、午、晚；还将一年分为四季，即冬、春、夏、秋；它通过光影，以及冷热的变化而做到这一点。这些划分就是对时间及其各个不同时期的观念之源头。空间的观念是由时间的度量产生的；因此，这一个在哪里，那一个也在哪里。<br />但在灵界，作为属灵之光和属灵之热源头的天堂太阳并不进行表面的循环和旋转，由此产生时间和空间的观念。从这个太阳流出的光是神的真理；从这个太阳流出的热是神的良善。这些在天使中间产生状态的观念；即由神之真理所产生的聪明和信的状态，以及由神之良善所产生的智慧和爱的状态。天使中间的这些状态变化就对应于世上光影的状态和热冷的状态；这些状态可归因于太阳，因为这太阳产生了时间，计量了空间。这个例子在某种程度上证明了内在真理，或适合天使，被称作“内在律法”的真理是何品质；以及外在真理，或适合世人，被称作“外在律法”的真理是何品质。它也解释了为何天使彼此讨论的东西赶出世人的理解，而且无法描述。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7381</b></p><p><b>7381.</b>
Say unto Aaron. That this signifies the influx of the internal law into the external law, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the law Divine (see n. 6723, 6752); and from the representation 
of Aaron, as being the doctrine of good and truth (n. 6998, 7089); the doctrine of good and truth which Aaron represents is nothing else than the external law coming forth from the internal law, 
that is, through the internal law from the Divine; and from the signification of "saying," as being influx (n. 6152, 6291, 7291). That "to say" here denotes influx is because Moses was to say to Aaron, 
and Moses is the internal law, and Aaron the external, and influx from the Divine takes place through the internal into the external. The internal law is the truth Divine itself such as it is in 
heaven, and the external law is the truth Divine such as it is on earth; thus the internal law is truth accommodated to angels, and the external law is truth accommodated to men. [2] As the internal 
law which Moses represents is truth accommodated to angels, and the external law which Aaron represents is truth accommodated to men, I may here say something about them. Truth accommodated to angels 
is for the most part incomprehensible to men, as is evident from the fact that things are seen and said in heaven such as eye has never seen, nor ear has ever heard. The reason is that the things said 
among the angels are spiritual things which have been abstracted from natural things, and consequently are remote from the ideas and expressions of human speech; for man has formed his ideas from the 
things in nature, and indeed in grosser nature, that is, from those which he has seen in the world and upon the earth, and has touched by sense, which things are material. The ideas of interior thought 
with man, although they are above material things, nevertheless terminate in material things, and where they terminate, there they appear to be, and from this he perceives that which he is thinking. 
Hence it is evident how the case is with that truth of faith, and what is its quality, which falls into the thought of man, and is called the external law, and is represented by Aaron.  [3] To illustrate 
this by an example: man cannot possibly think without the idea of time and space, which idea adheres to almost everything which he thinks; if idea from time and space were taken away from man, 
he would not know what he is thinking; and scarcely whether he is thinking. But in the ideas of the angels there is nothing from time and space, but instead of these there are states, and this because 
the natural world is distinguished from the spiritual world by time and space. The reason why there are time and space in the natural world, and instead of these there are states in the spiritual world, 
is that in the natural world the sun seems by apparent revolutions to make days and years, and to divide the days into four times, night, morning, noon, and evening; and the years also into four 
times, winter, spring, summer, and autumn; and also to do this by means of variations of light and shade, and of heat and cold. From this come the ideas of time and of its variations. The ideas of space 
arise from measuring by times, and therefore where the one is, there is the other. [4] But in the spiritual world, the sun of heaven, whence come spiritual light and spiritual heat, does not make 
apparent rotations and revolutions, and thus induce ideas of time and space. The light which is from that sun is truth Divine; and the heat which is from that sun is good Divine. From these arise with 
the angels ideas of states; states of intelligence and faith from truth Divine; and states of wisdom and love from good Divine. To the variations of these states with the angels correspond the states 
of light and shade in the world, and also states of heat and cold, which are from the sun when it makes times and measures spaces. From this example it may to a certain extent appear what is the quality 
of that internal truth, or truth accommodated to angels, which is called the "internal law;" and also what is the quality of that external truth, or truth accommodated to men, which is called the 
"external law;" also whence it is that the things which the angels speak among themselves are to man incomprehensible, and also unutterable. </p>

'Say to Aaron' means an influx of inward law into outward law. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the law of God, dealt with in <a href="6713.htm">6713</a>, <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>; from the representation of 'Aaron' as teachings 
presenting what is good and true, dealt with in <a href="6998.htm">6998</a>, <a href="7089.htm">7089</a>, these teachings represented by 'Aaron' being nothing other than outward law emanating from inward law, that is, from the Divine through 
inward law; and from the meaning of 'saying' as influx, as in <a href="6152.htm">6152</a>, <a href="6291.htm">6291</a>, <a href="7291.htm">7291</a>. The reason why at this point 'saying' means influx is that Moses is commanded to 'Say to Aaron'; 'Moses' is inward law, 
and 'Aaron' outward law, and influx from the Divine takes place through what is inward into what is outward. Inward law is God's truth itself as it exists in heaven, while outward law is God's truth 
as it exists on earth. Thus inward law is truth suited to angels, while outward law is truth suited to men. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since inward law, represented by 'Moses', is truth suited to angels, while outward law, 
represented by 'Aaron', is truth suited to men, let something be said about them here. Truth suited to angels is for the most part beyond the comprehension of men. This is clear from the consideration 
that in heaven things are seen and spoken such as eye has never seen, nor ear ever heard. The reason for this is that the things spoken of among angels are spiritual, which are withdrawn from natural 
things and consequently are far removed from the ideas and words belonging to man's speech. For man has formed his ideas from things in the natural order, especially its grosser aspects, that is, 
from things which he has seen in the world and on earth, and has had physical contact with, that is, material things. Even though the ideas belonging to a person's inward thought exist on a level above 
material things they are nevertheless founded on material things; and the level that ideas are founded on is the level on which they seem to exist. That is the level on which a person perceives the 
things he thinks about. From this one may see what the situation is with the truth of faith, and also the nature of that which comes within man's range of thought, namely that which is called outward 
law and is represented by 'Aaron'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Let the following example serve to shed light on this. Man can have no thought at all without ideas involving time and space; such ideas cling to practically 
every detail of what man thinks. If ideas formed from time and space were taken away from man he would not know what he thinks, and scarcely whether he thinks. Yet angels' ideas have nothing of time 
or space within them, but states instead. The reason is that the natural world marks itself off from the spiritual world by the existence of time and space within it. The reason why time and space exist 
in the natural world, but states instead in the spiritual world, is this: In the natural world the sun appears to give rise to days and years by its apparent revolutions. It divides the days up into 
the four periods of night, morning, midday, and evening, and the years too into the four seasons of winter, spring, summer, and autumn, which it effects by means of variations of light and shade, as 
well as of warmth and coldness. And these divisions are the source of ideas of time and varying periods of it. Ideas of space arise from the use of periods as measurements; therefore where one exists, 
so does the other.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But in the spiritual world the Sun of heaven, which is the source of spiritual light and spiritual heat, does not make circuits and revolutions which give rise to ideas of 
time and space. The light which flows from that Sun is God's truth, and the heat which flows from that Sun is God's goodness. These give rise to ideas of states among the angels, states of intelligence 
and faith being the product of God's truth, and states of wisdom and love the product of God's goodness. Variations in these states among the angels are what states of light and shade in the world, 
and also of warmth and coldness, correspond to, which are attributable to the sun since it is responsible for the existence of times and seasons and of spatial measurements. This example demonstrates 
to some extent what inward truth or truth suited to angels, called inward law, is like, and what outward truth or truth suited to men, referred to as outward law, is like. It also goes to explain why 
the things that angels discuss with one another are beyond man's comprehension and also indescribable. </p>

`Dic ad Aharonem': quod significet influxum legis internae in legem externam, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit lex Divina, de qua n. (x)6723, 6752; et ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' quod 
sit doctrina boni et veri, de qua n. 6998, 7089; doctrina boni et veri, quam Aharon repraesentat, non aliud est quam lex externa existens a lege interna, hoc est, per legem internam a Divino; et ex 
significatione `dicere' quod sit influxus, ut n. 6152, 6291, 7291; quod `dicere' hic sit influxus, est quia Moscheh diceret ad Aharonem, et Moscheh est lex interna, et Aharon {1} externa, {2}et influxus 
a Divino fit per internum in externum; lex interna est ipsum verum Divinum quale est in caelo, {3}et lex externa est verum Divinum quale est in terra; ita lex interna est verum accommodatum angelis, 
et lex externa est verum accommodatum hominibus. 	2 {4}Quia lex interna, quam Moscheh repraesentat, est verum accommodatum angelis, et lex externa, quam Aharon repraesentat, est verum accommodatum 
hominibus, de illis licet hic aliquid dicere: verum accommodatum angelis est quoad maximam partem hominibus incomprehensibile; hoc constat ex eo quod talia in caelo videantur et dicantur quae oculus 
nusquam viderat, nec auris usquam audiverat; causa est quia illa quae apud angelos dicuntur sunt spiritualia, quae abstracta sunt a naturalibus, {5} consequenter remota ab ideis et vocibus loquelae humanae; 
homo enim ideas suas formaverat ex illis quae in natura sunt, et quidem in natura crassiore, hoc est, ab illis quae in mundo et super terra viderat, (c)et sensu tetigerat, quae materialia sunt; 
{6}ideae cogitationis interioris apud hominem tametsi supra materialia {7}sunt, usque in materialibus terminantur, et ubi {8}terminantur, ibi {9}apparent esse, {10}inde percipit quid cogitat; inde patet 
quomodo se habet cum vero fidei et quale est, quod cadit in cogitationem {11} hominis, {12}et quod vocatur lex externa, et repraesentatur per Aharonem; illustretur hoc exemplo: homo nequaquam (t)cogitare 
3 potest absque idea temporis et spatii haec idea adhaeret paene singulis quae homo cogitat; si idea ex tempore et spatio auferretur homini, non sciret quid cogitat, {13}vix num cogitet; ast ideis 
angelorum nihil ex tempore et spatio inest sed loco illorum sunt status; causa est quia mundus naturalis se distinguit a mundo spirituali per tempus et spatium; quod tempus et spatium sit in mundo 
naturali, et pro illis status in mundo spirituali, est quia in mundo naturali apparet sol per apparentes circumvolutiones {14} facere dies et annos, ac distinguere dies in quattuor tempora, in noctem, 
mane, meridiem, et vesperam, (c)et {15}annos quoque in quattuor tempora, in hiemem, ver, aestatem, et autumnum, et hoc quoque per variationes lucis (c)et umbrae, tum caloris et frigoris; inde ideae 
temporis et ejus variationum; ideae spatii existunt ex mensuratione per tempora, quare ubi unum est, ibi est alterum; at in mundo spirituali, Sol caeli {16}, unde lux spiritualis 4 et calor spiritualis, 
non circumgyrationes et circumvolutiones facit, ac inde ideas temporis et spatii inducit;{17} lux quae ex Sole illo est verum Divinum, et calor qui ex Sole illo est bonum Divinum; ex his existunt 
{18}ideae statuum apud angelos, status intelligentiae et fidei a vero Divino, (c)ac status sapientiae et amoris a bono Divino; variationes horum statuum apud angelos sunt quibus correspondent in mundo 
status lucis et umbrae, tum caloris et frigoris, (m)quae sunt solis cum tempora facit, et spatia mensurat.(n)  Ex hoc exemplo (t)constare aliquatenus potest quale est verum internum seu verum accommodatum 
angelis, quod lex interna vocatur, et quale est verum externum seu verum accommodatum hominibus, quod lex externa dicitur; tum unde est quod quae angeli apud se loquuntur homini sint incomprehensibilia
