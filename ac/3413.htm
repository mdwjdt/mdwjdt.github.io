<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3413节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3413.</strong>“用土把它们填满了”表用世俗事物，用自我之爱和对物质利益的爱。这从“土”的含义清楚可知，“土”是指具有这种性质的事物（<a href="249.htm">249</a>节）。意思是这样：那些所谓的“非利士人”，就是不关注生活，而关注教义的人用世俗之爱，也就是自我之爱和利益之爱抹掉内层真理。他们由于这些爱而被称为“未受割礼的”（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2056.htm">2056</a>，<a href="2632.htm">2632</a>节） 。事实上，他们在这些爱的影响下，不能不“用土填满亚伯拉罕的井”，也就是用世俗事物抹掉圣言的内层真理，因为他们绝不可能通过这些爱看到属灵事物，也就是属于来自主的真理之光的事物。实际上，这些爱带来黑暗，而这黑暗熄灭这光。因为如刚才所述（<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>节），来自主的真理之光一靠近，只关心教义、不关心生活的人就会陷入一片漆黑和愚蠢，甚至会变得愤怒，竭尽所能、千方百计地摧毁真理。因为自我之爱和利益之爱具有这样的性质：它们根本不能容忍来自神性的任何真理靠近它们。然而，这种人却能自夸自耀，因为他们知道真理；甚至以表面的热情宣扬它们。但是，这其实是点燃并激发他们的自我之爱和利益之爱的火，并且他们的激情纯粹是这些爱所激发的热情。这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来，即：即便真理与这种人的实际生活发生冲突，他们也能以同样的激情或热情来宣扬它们。这些就是堵塞圣言本身，也就是一切真理的源泉的世俗事物。</p>

And filled them with dust. That this signifies by means of earthly things, that is, by the loves of self and of gain, is evident from the signification of "dust," as being that which is of this nature 
(n. 249). The meaning is that those called "Philistines" (that is, those who are not in life but in doctrine) obliterate interior truths by earthly loves, which are the love of self and of gain; from 
these loves they were called the "uncircumcised" (n. 2039, 2044, 2056, 2632). For they who are in these loves cannot but fill the wells of Abraham with dust (that is, obliterate the interior truths 
of the Word by earthly things), because from these loves they cannot possibly see spiritual things (that is, the things which are of the light of truth from the Lord); for these loves induce darkness, 
and darkness extinguishes this light. For as before said (n. 3412), on the approach of the light of truth from the Lord, they who are in doctrine only, and not in life, are in total darkness and stupor, 
and even become angry, and in every way busy themselves to dissipate truths; for the love of self and of gain is of such a nature that it cannot endure the near approach of anything of truth from 
the Divine. Nevertheless such persons can glory and take pride in the fact that they know truths, nay, they preach them from a kind of zeal; but it is the fires of those loves that kindle and arouse them, 
and their zeal is merely a fervor thence derived, as is sufficiently evident from the fact that they can preach against their own veriest life with a like zeal or fervor. These are the earthly things 
by which the Word itself, which is the fountain of all truth, is blocked up. </p>

'And filled them up with dust' means by means of earthly things, that is, by means of self-love and love of material gain. This is clear from the meaning of 'duet' as such, dealt with in <a href="249.htm">249</a>. The meaning 
is that those who are called 'the Philistines', that is, who are not concerned with life but with doctrine, efface interior truths by means of earthly loves, which are self-love and love of gain. 
Because of those loves they are called 'the uncircumcised', <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2056.htm">2056</a>, <a href="2632.htm">2632</a>. Indeed people who are under the influence of those loves cannot avoid 'filling up the wells of Abraham with dust', 
that is, effacing the interior truths of the Word by means of earthly things, for there is no way in which they are able from these loves to see spiritual things, that is, things which belong to the light 
of truth from the Lord. In fact those loves introduce darkness, and this banishes that light, for as stated just above in <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>, as the light of truth from the Lord draws nearer, people who are concerned 
with doctrine alone and not with life are plunged into complete darkness and stupidity. Indeed they become like those in a rage, doing all they can to destroy truths in every way. For self- love 
and the love of gain are such that they do not allow any truth at all from the Divine to come anywhere near them. Nevertheless those people are able to boast of and pride themselves in the fact that 
they know truths; indeed they proclaim them with seeming zeal. It is however the fires of self-love and love of gain which inflame them and spur them on, and their zeal is merely the enthusiasm fired 
by those loves. This becomes quite clear from the fact that even though truths run counter to such persons' actual lives they are able to proclaim them with the selfsame zeal or enthusiasm. These are 
the earthly things which block the Word itself, the fountain of all truth. </p>

`Et impleverunt illos pulvere':  quod significet per terrestria, hoc est, per amores sui et lucri, constat a significatione `pulveris' quod sit tale, de qua n. 249; sensus est quod illi qui `Philistaei' 
vocantur, hoc est, qui non in vita sed in doctrina sunt, vera interiora obliterent per amores terrestres, qui sunt amor sui et amor lucri; ex illis amoribus dicti sunt incircumcisi, n. 2039, (x)2049, 
2056, 2632; qui enim in illis sunt, non aliter possunt quam puteos Abrahami implere pulvere, hoc est, vera interiora Verbi obliterare per terrestria; nam {1}ex amoribus illis nequaquam possunt videre 
spiritualia, hoc est, illa quae lucis veri sunt a Domino; amores enim illi inducunt tenebras, et hae lucem illam exstinguunt, nam ut {2}dictum mox supra n. 3412, approximante luce veri a Domino, 
illi qui in sola doctrina sunt, non in vita, caligantur prorsus et obstupescunt, immo fiunt tales ut irascantur, (c)et omni modo vera dissipare satagant; amor enim sui et lucri talis est ut non patiatur 
aliquid veri a Divino prope ad se accedere: sed usque gloriari et superbire possunt ex eo quod vera sciant, immo eadem ex quasi zelo praedicant, sed sunt ignes amorum illorum qui accendunt et excitant, 
et zelus est modo fervor inde; quod satis constare potest ex eo quod contra ipsissimam suam vitam cum simili zelo seu fervore praedicare queant. Haec {3}sunt terrestria, quibus ipsum Verbum, {4}quod 
est fons omnis veri, obstruitur. @1 qui in terrestribus amoribus sunt$  @2 after 3412$  @3 i omnis$  @4 qui AI$  </p>
