<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1556节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1556．“就是起先支搭帐棚的地方”表朝向祂具有认知之前就在那里的神圣事物。这从“帐棚”的含义和刚才所述清楚可知，前面说过（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1452.htm">1452</a>节），“帐棚”是指信的神圣事物。因此，它表示朝主被赋予知识和认知之前就已具有的属天之物发展，这从前一章8节所述明显可知，即“从那里亚伯兰又迁到伯特利东边的山，支搭帐棚”。这发生在他旅居埃及之前，即主被赋予知识和认知之前。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1556.</strong> All the way to the place where his tent had been before means to the holy traits that existed before he became steeped in knowledge. This can be seen from the symbolism of a tent as holy attributes of faith (dealt with previously at 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1556/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414" target=_top>414</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1556/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1452" target=_top>1452</a>) and from the remarks just above.<br />Consequently, it means that the Lord returned to the heavenly qualities he possessed before he had absorbed factual and religious knowledge, as can be seen from the words of the last chapter: "And Abram moved from there onto a mountain to the east of Bethel and spread his tent" (verse 8 [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1556/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450" target=_top>1450-1455</a>]). This was before he set out for Egypt, that is, before the Lord became steeped in factual and religious knowledge. </p>

Unto the place where his tent was before. That this signifies to the holy things which there were before He was imbued with knowledges, is evident from the signification of a "tent," which is the holy 
things of faith (concerning which, n. 414, 1452, and from what has just been said); it thus signifies to the celestial things which the Lord had before He was imbued with knowledges, as is evident from 
what was said in the preceding chapter: "and Abram removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent" (verse 8); which was before he departed into Egypt, that is, before 
the Lord was imbued with knowledges. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1556</b></p><p><b>1556.</b>
'Even to the place where his tent had been before' means towards the holy things which were there before He had been endowed with cognitions. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tent' as the holy things 
of faith, dealt with already in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1452.htm">1452</a>, and from what has just been stated. Thus it was an advance towards the celestial things which the Lord already possessed before He was endowed with knowledge 
and cognitions, as is clear from what is said in verse 8 of the previous chapter, 'And Abram removed from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent'. This happened before 
he travelled to Egypt, that is, before the Lord was endowed with knowledge and cognitions. </p>

'Usque ad locum, uni fuit tentorium illius prius': quod significet sancta quae fuerunt antequam cognitionibus imbutus, constat a significatione 'tentorii' quod sint sancta fidei, de qua prius n. 414, 
1452, et ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt: ita ad caelestia, quae habuit Dominus antequam scientiis et cognitionibus imbutus, ut constat ab illis quae in cap. praec. 'et transtulit Abram inde in montem 
ab oriente Betheli, et tetendit tentorium,' vers. 8, quod fuit antequam profectus in Aegyptum, hoc est, antequam Dominus scientiis et cognitionibus imbutus fuit. </p>
