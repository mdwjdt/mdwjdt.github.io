<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6359节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6359.</strong>“他们的烈怒坚硬可诅”表对源于良善的真理的憎恶或背离，一种坚定且决绝的憎恶或背离。这从“烈怒”和“坚硬”的含义清楚可知：“烈怒”是指对真理的憎恶或背离，“烈怒”（wrath）论及真理，“怒气”（anger）论及良善（<a href="3614.htm">3614</a>节）；“坚硬”是指坚定和决绝，因为当虚假被坚定接受，以致一个人确信它是正确的时，这虚假就是坚硬和牢固的。我被允许通过经历得以知道这种坚硬，因为在灵人和天使当中，来自良善的真理看似且呈现为某种柔软的东西；而来自邪恶的虚假看似并呈现为某种坚硬的东西，并且来自邪恶的虚假越被坚定地接受，就变得越坚硬。一旦基于大量经验的坚定证据导致完全确信它是正确的，他们当中的这种坚硬就看似骨头那样坚硬。这种坚硬还像世上物体的坚硬，它会反射光线。同样，当从主流出的天堂之光照到由来自邪恶的虚假所产生的坚硬上时，它就会进行反射；而另一方面，当从主流出的天堂之光照到来自良善的真理所产生的柔软上时，它就会被接受或吸收。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6359</b></p><p><b>6359.</b>
And their wrath for it was hard. That this signifies a turning away from the derivative truth, that it was confirmed, is evident from the signification of "wrath," as being a turning away from truth 
(that "wrath" is predicated of truth, and "anger" of good, may be seen above, n. 3614); and from the signification of "hard," as being what is confirmed, for the falsity which has been confirmed even 
to persuasion, is hard. That it is hard has been given to know from experience, for among spirits and among the angels truth from good appears and is presented to view as soft, but falsity from evil as 
hard, and this in proportion as the falsity from evil is more confirmed. When persuasion has been brought about by means of confirmation from many things, this hardness appears there like the hardness 
of bone. Such hardness is also like the hardness in this world, in that it reflects the rays of light. Thus when the light of heaven from the Lord falls upon the hardness produced by falsity from evil, 
it is reflected; but on the other hand, when the light of heaven from the Lord falls upon the softness produced by truth from good, it is received. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6359</b></p><p><b>6359.</b>
'And their wrath, for it is hard' means an aversion to the truth that is derived from good - a firm and determined aversion. This is clear from the meaning of 'wrath' as an aversion to truth - 'wrath' 
is used in reference to truth and 'anger' to good, see <a href="3614.htm">3614</a>; and from the meaning of 'hard' as firm and determined. For when a false idea has been accepted so firmly that a person is convinced it is 
right it is then hard and fast. I have been allowed from experience to know of such hardness, for among spirits and angels truth from good looks like and presents itself as something soft, whereas falsity 
from evil does so as something hard, becoming ever harder as such falsity from evil becomes more firmly accepted. Once firm proof based on much evidence has led to utter conviction that it is right, 
that hardness among them seems to be like the hardness of a bone. Such hardness is also like the hardness of an object in the world, in that rays of light rebound from it. In the same way when the 
light of heaven flowing from the Lord falls on the hardness that falsity from evil produces, it rebounds; but when on the other hand the light of heaven flowing from the Lord falls on the softness that 
truth from good produces, it is taken in. </p>

`Et excandescentia eorum quia dura':  quod significet aversionem a vero inde quod confirmata, constat a significatione `excandescentiae' quod sit aversio a vero; quod `excandescentia' praedicetur de 
vero et `ira' de bono, videatur n.  3614; et ex significatione `durae' quod sit confirmata; nam falsum quod confirmatum est usque ad persuasionem, hoc `durum' est; quod durum sit, scire datum est ab 
experientia, verum enim ex bono apud spiritus et apud angelos {1}apparet et sistitur ut molle, at falsum ex malo {2}ut durum, et eo durius quo magis falsum ex malo est confirmatum; cum per confirmationem 
a multis persuasum est, tunc durum illud apparet ibi ut durum ossis:  tale durum est quoque simile duro in mundo, in eo quod reflectat radios lucis; {3}ita cum lux caeli a Domino incidit in durum 
ex falso a malo, reflectitur, vicissim autem cum lux caeli a Domino incidit in molle ex vero a bono, tunc recipitur.  @1 est molle et lene$ @2 est$ @3 nam$ </p>
