<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1626节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1626.</strong>除了这些花园外，还能看到各个城市，城市中有宏伟的宫殿彼此毗连，并且五光十色，远远超越建筑师们的一切艺术。因此，毫不奇怪，当先知的内视被打开后，他们也能看到类似城市，并且看得如此清晰，以致世上找不到比这更清晰的事物。如约翰所看到的新耶路撒冷是用下面这些话来描述的：<br />在灵里，天使就带我到一座高大的山，将那由神那里从天而降的大城圣耶路撒冷指示我。有高大的墙，有十二个门。墙是碧玉造的，城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃。城墙的根基是用各样宝石修饰的：第一根基是碧玉，第二是蓝宝石，第三是绿玛瑙，第四是绿宝石，第五是红玛瑙，第六是红宝石，第七是黄璧玺，第八是水苍玉，第九是红璧玺，第十是翡翠，第十一是紫玛瑙，第十二是紫晶。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">21:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.18.htm">18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.20.htm">20</a>）<br />先知们也目睹过此类景象。天使和天使灵会在晴天白日下看到无数诸如此类的事物。令人惊讶的是，每种感官都能感知到它们。若人以人类哲学和推理所用的术语和定义扑灭了属灵的观念，那么这些事物对他来说是难以置信的。然而，它们又是千真万确的，对此，从圣徒们经常看到它们的事实也能理解。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1626.</strong> In addition to these wonders of paradise, one also sees cities full of splendid mansions, one after another, gleaming with color, beyond the skill of any architect to create. Not surprisingly, cities like them appeared to the prophets as well, when their inner eyes were open; and these cities were as plain to see as any that could exist in the world. The New Jerusalem appeared to John, for instance, and he described it in these words:<br />He took me away in spirit onto a mountain big and high and showed me the great city, Jerusalem the Holy, having a wall big and high, having twelve gates. The structure of the wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold, like golden glass.{*1} The foundations of the wall were adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sard, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth,{*2} the twelfth amethyst.

Besides these paradisal scenes, cities are also presented to view, with magnificent palaces, contiguous to one another, resplendent in their coloring, beyond all the art of the architect. Nor is this 
to be wondered at; cities of similar appearance were seen also by the prophets, when their interior sight was opened, and this so clearly that nothing in the world could be more distinct. Thus was the 
New Jerusalem seen by John, which is also described by him in these words: </p>
<p>     And he carried me away in the spirit upon a mountain great and high, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem; 
having a wall great and high, having twelve gates; and the building of the wall thereof was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto golden glass. The foundations of the wall there adorned with 
all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth 
beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprasus, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst (Rev. 21:10, 12, 18-20). Such things were seen also by the prophets. Similar things, beyond number, are seen 
by angels and angelic spirits in clear day; and wonderful to say, they are perceived with all fullness of sense. These things cannot be credited by one who has extinguished spiritual ideas by the terms 
and definitions of human philosophy, and by reasonings; and yet they are most true. That they are true might have been apprehended from the fact that they have been seen so frequently by the saints. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1626</b></p><p><b>1626.</b>
In addition to the gardens, cities too are to be seen with magnificent palaces, built in terraces, resplendent in colours, and far superior to anything architects can design. It is not surprising therefore 
that the like were also seen by the prophets when their interior sight had been opened, seen indeed so plainly that nothing in the world is ever plainer, such as the New Jerusalem seen by John, 
which he also describes in the following words, </p>
<blockquote>
He carried me away in the spins on to a great and high mountain and showed me the great city, the Holy Jerusalem, having a wall great and high, having 
twelve gates. The structure of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> glass. The foundations of the wall were furnished with every precious stone, the first foundation was jasper, 
the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh 
jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:10,%2012,%2018-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:10, 12, 18-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Similar scenes were witnessed by the prophets as well. Countless things such as these are seen in broad daylight by angels and angelic spirits, 
and what is astonishing, they are perceived by each of the senses. This no one is ever able to believe who has done away with spiritual ideas by means of the terms and definitions employed in human 
philosophy and by means of reasonings; yet they are utterly true. That they are true could have been grasped from the fact that they have been seen so often by saints.

Praeter paradisiaca haec, sistuntur etiam videndae urbes cum palatiis magnificis, contiguis, splendidis ex coloribus, supra omnem artem architectonicam: quod nec mirum, similes quoque visae sunt prophetis 
quando visus interior illis apertus, et quidem tam manifeste ut non manifestius in mundo; ut Johanni Nova Hierosolyma, quae quoque ab illo describitur his verbis, 	Abstulit me in spiritu super 
montem magnum et altum, et ostendi mihi civitatem magnam, Sanctam Hierosolymam,... habentem murum magnum et altum, habentem portas duodecim;... 	erat structura muri jaspis, et civitas aurum purum similis

<p>praeter a prophetis: innumerabilia talia ab angelis et spiritibus 
angelicis videntur in clara die, et quod mirum, percipiuntur omni sensu; quod nusquam aliqui qui exstinxit ideas spirituales per philosophiae humanae terminos et definitiones perque ratiocinationes, 
credere potest, cum tamen verissima sunt; quod vera inde capere potuissent quod sanctis toties visa sint. </p>
