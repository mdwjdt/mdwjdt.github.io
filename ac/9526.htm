Verses 23-30. And thou shalt make a table of shittim wood; two cubits the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. And thou shalt overlay it with pure 
gold, and make thereto a border of gold round about. And thou shalt make unto it a closure of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a border of gold for the closure thereof round about. And 
thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and shalt put the rings upon the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. Over against the closure shall the rings be, for houses for the staves to 
carry the table. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them. And thou shalt make the little dishes thereof and the cups thereof, 
and the salvers thereof, and the little brooms thereof, with which it shall be covered; of pure gold shalt thou make them. And thou shalt set upon the table the bread of faces, unto My faces continually. 
"And thou shalt make a table," signifies a receptacle of the celestial things that belong to the good of love; "of shittim wood," signifies from mercy; "two cubits the length thereof," signifies 
all in respect to conjunction with good; "and a cubit the breadth thereof," signifies somewhat in respect to conjunction with truth; "and a cubit and a half the height thereof," signifies full in respect 
to degrees; "and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold," signifies what is representative of this good from mercy; "and make thereto a border of gold round about," signifies a fixing of the bounds 
of the sphere of good by the Divine good of the Lord; "and thou shalt make unto it a closure of a handbreadth round about," signifies conjunction there with truth from the Divine; "and thou shalt make 
a border of gold for the closure thereof round about," signifies a fixing of the bounds of the sphere of Divine good; "and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold," signifies the ultimate receptacle 
of the heavenly marriage, which is of Divine good with Divine truth; "and shalt put the rings upon the four corners," signifies the consequent stability; "that are on the four feet thereof," signifies 
in the natural sphere; "over against the closure shall the rings be, for houses for the staves," signifies the consequent power; "to carry the table," signifies for coming-forth and subsistence; 
"and thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood," signifies the power of truth from good; "and overlay them with gold," signifies what is representative of good; "and the table shall be carried with them" 
signifies the consequent endurance; "and thou shalt make the little dishes thereof, and the cups thereof, and the salvers thereof, and the little brooms thereof, with which it shall be covered," 
signifies the knowledges of celestial good and truth; "of pure gold shalt thou make them," signifies that which is from good; "and thou shalt set upon the table the bread of faces," signifies the Lord 
there as to celestial good; "unto My faces continually," signifies thus the presence of the Lord with peace and with heavenly joy from mercy. </p>

Verses 23-30 And you shall make a table of shittim wood; two cubits shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height. And you shall overlay it with pure gold; and you shall 
make for it a rim of gold round about. And you shall make for it a rail of a hand's breadth round about; and you shall make a rim of gold for its rail round about. And you shall make for it four 
rings of gold, and you shall put the rings on the four corners which are on its four feet. The rings shall be close to the rail, as houses for the poles to carry the table. And you shall make the poles 
from shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them. And you shall make its dishes, and its cups, and its small dishes, and its small brushes, with which it shall 
be covered; from pure gold you shall make them. And you shall put on the table the bread of faces, towards My faces unceasingly.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>  </p>
<p>'And you shall make a table' means a receptacle of heavenly blessings 
that belong to the good of love. 'Of shittim wood' means out of mercy. 'Two cubits shall be its length' means all so far as the joining to good is concerned. 'And a cubit its breadth' means somewhat 
so far as the joining to truth is concerned. 'And a cubit and a half its height' means what is complete so far as degrees are concerned. 'And you shall overlay it with pure gold' means a representative

breadth round about' means the joining there to truth from the Divine. 'And you shall make a rim of gold for its rail round about' means the border of the sphere of Divine Good. 'And you shall make 
for it four rings of gold' means the outermost receptacle of the heavenly marriage, which is that of Divine Good to Divine Truth. 'And you shall put the rings on its four corners' means the resulting 
firmness. 'Which are on its four feet' means in the natural sphere. 'The rings shall be close to the rail, as houses for the poles' means the power from this. 'To carry the table' means in order to bring 
into being and keep in being. 'And you shall make the poles from shittim wood' means the power that truth derived from good possesses. 'And overlay them with gold' means a representative sign of good. 
'And the table shall be carried with them' means being thereby held firmly in being. 'And you shall make its dishes, its cups, and its small dishes, and its small brushes, with which it shall be 
covered' means cognitions of celestial good and truth. 'From pure gold you shall make them' means that they are derived from good. 'And you shall put on the table the bread of faces' means the Lord there 
in respect of celestial good. 'Towards My faces unceasingly' means the Lord's presence thereby with peace and heavenly joy flowing from His mercy.
