<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7802节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7802.</strong>灵人与居民交谈，并教导他们，如果他们做了坏事，还会惩罚他们，这在木星是很平常的事。关于这个主题，他们的天使告诉我许多事，我想依次讲述它们。木星灵之所以能与世人交谈，是因为这些人大量思想天堂和死后的生活，相对来说，很少关心世上的生活。他们知道，他们死后还会活着，并在幸福的状态下生活，这种状态取决于他们的内在人在世上所被带入的状态。古时，与灵人并天使交谈在我们地球也是平常事，原因是一样的，即：这些人大量思想天堂，很少思想世界。但随着时间推移，与天堂的这种活生生的交流中断了，因为人从内在变得外在，也就是说，他开始大量思想世界，很少思想天堂，尤其当他不再相信天堂或地狱的存在，也不相信自己里面有一个死后活着的灵人时，更是如此。因为如今人们都以为身体凭自己活着，而不是靠它的灵活着。因此，现在的人若不信他带着身体复活，就根本不信复活。</p>

It is a common thing on that earth for spirits to speak with the inhabitants and instruct them, and also chastise them if they have done evil; on which subject, as many things have been related to me 
by their angels, I would speak in order. The reason why the spirits of that planet speak with the men, is that these think much about heaven, and about the life after death; and are comparatively but 
little solicitous about life in the world; for they know that they will live after their decease, and in a state of happiness according to the state of their internal man as formed in the world. It was 
also a common thing on our earth in ancient times to speak with spirits and angels, from a like cause, namely, that those men thought about heaven, and little about the world. But this living communication 
with heaven was in time closed, as man from internal became external, that is, as he began to think about the world and little about heaven, and especially when he no longer believed that there 
is a heaven or a hell, nor that there is in himself a spirit man who lives after death. For at this day it is believed that the body lives from itself, and not from its spirit; and therefore unless 
man could now have faith that he is to rise again with the body, he would have no belief in a resurrection. </p>

It is common on that planet for spirits to talk to inhabitants and instruct them, and also to chastise them if they have been behaving badly. Since this is a subject about which their angels have told 
me many things I would like to mention them in order. The reason why spirits there talk to people is that they concentrate much of their thought on heaven and life after death, and in comparison with 
this give little thought to life in the world. They know that they will be alive after death, living in a state of happiness that depends on the condition into which their internal man was brought in 
the world. Talking to spirits and angels was also common on our planet in ancient times, and for the same reason, that their thought was concentrated on heaven and little on the world. But in course 
of time that live contact with heaven was cut off, as people ceased to be internal and became external, that is, as man began to concentrate his thought on the world and little on heaven, and especially 
when he ceased to believe any longer in the existence of heaven or hell, or in the presence within himself of a person and spirit that lives after death. For the belief at the present day is that 
the body lives independently, not that it receives life from its spirit. Therefore unless people today were allowed to believe that they will rise again in their bodies they would have no belief at all 
in resurrection. </p>

Commune est in illa tellure quod spiritus loquantur cum incolis et instruant eos, et quoque castigent si male egerant; de qua re quia plura mihi ab angelis eorum relata sunt, velim ordine illa memorare. 
 Quod spiritus {1}ibi cum hominibus loquantur, est causa quia multum cogitant de caelo et de vita post mortem, et quod de vita in mundo respective parum solliciti sint; sciunt enim quod victuri cum 
obeunt, et in statu felici secundum statum interni sui hominis formatum in mundo.  Loqui cum spiritibus et angelis etiam commune fuit in hac tellure antiquis temporibus, ex simili causa, quod nempe 
cogitaverint de caelo et parum de mundo; sed communicatio illa viva cum caelo tempore clausa est, sicut homo ab interno factus est externus, hoc est, sicut cogitare coepit de mundo et parum de caelo; 
et {2}magis cum non amplius crederet dari caelum nec infernum, nec in se esse hominem spiritum qui vivat post mortem; hodie enim creditur quod corpus vivat ex se, non ex suo spiritu; quare nisi homo 
nunc fidem (t)habere posset, quod cum corpore resurrecturus, nullam {3} de resurrectione fidem haberet. 	@1 After hominibus$ 	@2 tandem$ 	@3 i prorsus$ </p>
