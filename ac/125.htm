<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第125节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>125.</strong>创世记2:16 耶和华神吩咐他说，园中各样的树，你可以随意吃。<br />“随意吃园中各样的树”表觉知良善与真理，因为如前面所说，“树”象征觉。上古教会的人凭启示拥有真知，因为他们能与主并天使交流，也通过异象和异梦受教。对他们来说，这些是极喜乐之事。他们从主获得持续的觉知，对于记忆中的知识，他们能立时洞察它是否合乎真理与良善，若有错误浮现，他们不仅躲避，且视之为可怖之物。<br />天使的状态也是如此。后来，对真理与良善的认知取代了上古教会的觉知，这些认知来源于先前的启示和后来圣经给出的启示。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]125.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_125/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_16" target=_top>Genesis 2:16</a>. And Jehovah God commanded the human concerning it, saying, "From every tree of the garden you are definitely to eat."<br />To eat from every tree is to depend on perception in order to know and recognize what is good and true; a tree is perception, as stated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_125/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_102" target=_top>102</a>].<br />The people of the earliest church knew about true faith through revelations, since they spoke with the Lord and angels. They were also taught through visions and dreams, which filled them with the exquisite pleasures of paradise.<br />They received from the Lord an uninterrupted state of perception, which enabled them to tell immediately whether or not a thought based on memorized information was true and good. This ability was so unerring that if something false surfaced, it inspired not merely distaste but even horror in them. It is the same with angels.<br />Later on, the earliest church's perceptive abilities were replaced by a knowledge of truth and goodness based [at first] on the prior revelations and afterward on revelations recorded in the Word. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 125</b></p><p><b>125.</b>
Verse 16. And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden, eating thou mayest eat. To "eat of every tree" is to know from perception what is good and true; for, as before observed, 
a "tree" signifies perception. The men of the Most Ancient Church had the knowledges of true faith by means of revelations, for they conversed with the Lord and with angels, and were also instructed 
by visions and dreams, which were most delightful and paradisal to them. They had from the Lord continual perception, so that when they reflected on what was treasured up in the memory they instantly 
perceived whether it was true and good, insomuch that when anything false presented itself, they not only avoided it but even regarded it with horror: such also is the state of the angels. In place 
of this perception of the Most Ancient Church, however, there afterwards succeeded the knowledge [cognitio] of what is true and good from what had been previously revealed, and afterwards from what 
was revealed in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 125</b></p><p><b>125.</b>
Verse 16 And Jehovah God commanded the man and said, From every tree in the garden you may indeed eat.  </p>
<p>'Eating of every tree' is recognizing and knowing, from perception, what good and truth are; 
for, as stated already, 'a tree' means perception. Members of the Most Ancient Church possessed the cognitions of true faith by means of revelations, for they talked to the Lord and to angels. They were 
also taught through visions and dreams, which to them were supremely delightful and blissful. They received perception from the Lord continually; and as a result of that perception, when they thought 
from things in their memory they instantly perceived whether these were true and good, insomuch that when anything false came up they not only had nothing to do with it but were also horrified. This 
is also the state of angels. Later on however knowledge of what is true and good took the place of the perception which the Most Ancient Church enjoyed, a knowledge based on what had been previously 
revealed, and later, on things revealed in the Word.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 125</b>
</p><b>125.</b>
Vers. 16.  Et praecepit Jehovah Deus super illum homini, dicendo, Ab omni arbore horti edendo edas.  'Edere ex omni arbore' est ex perceptione nosse et scire quid bonum et verum; nam, ut dictum, perceptio 
est 'arbor.' Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines cognitiones verae fidei habebant per revelationes, nam locuti sunt cum Domino et cum angelis; ut et instructi per visiones et somnia, quae illis erant 
deliciosissima et paradisiaca; a Domino habebant continue perceptionem, quae talis est ut cum cogitaverint ex illis quae erant memoriae, ilico perceperint num verum et bonum, usque adeo ut dum falsum 
objiceretur, non modo aversati sint sed etiam horruerint; talis quoque est status angelorum. Sed loco perceptionis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae successit dein cognitio veri et boni, ex revelatis prius, 
dein ex revelatis in Verbo.
