<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2504节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2504.</strong>“寄居在基拉耳”表随之在信的属灵事物上接受教导。这从“寄居”和“基拉耳”的含义清楚可知：“寄居”是指接受教导（参看<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>节）；“基拉耳”是指信的属灵实体。在创世记，经上数次提及基拉耳（如<a href="http://39-27.cn/创10.19.htm">10:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.1.htm">26:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.26.htm">26</a>），它在这些地方表示信。原因在于，基拉耳就在非利士境内，而“非利士”表示信之认知的记忆知识（参看<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>节）。基拉耳也是非利士王所住的地方。正因如此，“基拉耳”表信本身（<a href="1209.htm">1209</a>节）；而“基拉耳王”则表信的真理本身，因为“王”的内义是指真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。因此，“亚比米勒”，也就是下文的主题，表示信的教义。<br />总的来说，信的事物有觉性之物（intellectual thing），理性事物和记忆知识。它们依次从内在进入外在。信的至内在之物被称为觉性（intellectual）；从它们降下来或由此而来的事物是信的理性事物；从理性事物降下来的事物则是信的记忆知识。用学者的话说，它们犹如在先者之于在后者，或也可说，优质者之于低劣者，即内在之于外在。诚然，在人看来，似乎信的记忆知识是首先的，然后是由它所产生的理性，最后是觉性，因为人自童年时就是这么发展的。但事实上，觉性不断流入理性，理性不断流入认知能力，尽管这个人并未意识到这一点。在童年时期，这种流注是模糊的；在成年时期，它较为明显；最后，当这个人重生后，它变得非常明显。一旦他重生，这种秩序就变得非常明显，在来世尤为明显（参看<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>节）。所有这些都被称为“属灵事物”，它们以这种方式被分成各个等级，并以上述秩序彼此相随。信的属灵事物就是源良善，即来自属天源头的一切真理。凡源于属天者之物，都是信的属灵事物。</p>

And he sojourned in Gerar. That this signifies instruction thence in the spiritual things of faith, is evident from the signification of "sojourning," as being to be instructed (see n. 1463, 2025); and 
from the signification of "Gerar," as being what is spiritual of faith. Gerar is named in several places in Genesis (as chapter 10:19, 26:1, 6, 17, 20, 26); and in these it signifies faith, and this 
for the reason that Gerar was in Philistia; and by "Philistia" is signified the mere memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith (see n. 1197, 1198); and it was Gerar where the king of the Philistines 
dwelt. Hence it is that faith itself is signified by "Gerar" (n. 1209); and by the "king of Gerar," the truth itself of faith; for "king" in the internal sense is truth (n. 1672, 2015, 2069). Thus 
by "Abimelech" is signified the doctrine of faith, concerning which in what follows. [2] In general there are intellectual things of faith, rational things of faith, and memory-knowledges of faith. They 
thus proceed in their order from interiors to exteriors. The things of faith which are inmost are called intellectual; those which proceed from them or thence are the rational things of faith; and 
those which proceed again from these are the memory-knowledges of faith. They are-to use the language of the learned-as prior to posterior, or what is the same, as higher to lower, that is, as interior 
to exterior. It indeed appears to man as if the memory-knowledge of faith were first, and that the rational then came forth from it, and at length the intellectual; and this for the reason that man 
advances in this way from his childhood. Nevertheless, although man is not aware of it, the intellectual flows in continually into the rational, and this into the faculty of knowing;* but in childhood 
obscurely, in adult age more evidently, and at last in full light when the man has been regenerated. Then it is apparent that this is the order, and still more fully in the other life (see n. 1495). 
All these are called "spiritual things;" which are distinguished in this way into degrees, and succeed one another in such an order. The spiritual things of faith are all the truths which are from good, 
that is, from a celestial origin. Whatever is derived from the celestial is a spiritual thing of faith. * See n. 1901 at the end as compared with n. 1902. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2504</b></p><p><b>2504.</b>
'And he sojourned in Gerar' means consequent instruction in the spiritual things of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'sojourning' as receiving instruction, dealt with in <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, and from 
the meaning of 'Gerar' as the spiritual entity of faith. Gerar is mentioned in several places in Genesis, as in Chapter 10: <a href="19.htm">19</a>; 26: <a href="1.htm">1</a>, <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>, and in those places it means faith, the reason being 
that Gerar was in Philistia, and 'Philistia' means knowledge of the cognitions of faith, see <a href="1197.htm">1197</a>, <a href="1198.htm">1198</a>. Gerar was also the place where the king of the Philistines used to live. Consequently 'Gerar' 
means faith itself, <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>, and 'the king of Gerar' the truth itself of faith, for 'a king' in the internal sense is truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>. Thus 'Abimelech' who is the subject in what follows means 
the doctrine of faith. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 In general there are intellectual things of faith, rational things of faith, and factual things of faith. In relation to one another they accordingly pass from more interior 
to more exterior. The inmost things of faith are called intellectual; those which pass down from them or from there are the rational things of faith; and those in turn which pass down from these are 
the factual things of faith. They are interrelated, to use the language of the learned, as prior to posterior, or what amounts to the same, as superior to inferior, that is, as more interior to more 
exterior. It does indeed seem to man as though the factual degree of faith is first and that the rational then arises from that, and after this the intellectual from that, for the reason that this is 
the way a human being develops from childhood onwards. But in fact the intellectual is constantly flowing; into the rational, and the rational into the factual, though man is not directly conscious 
of it. In childhood the influx is obscure; in adult years it is more noticeable; and when at length the individual has been regenerated it is quite manifest. Once he is regenerate this order is quite 
apparent, and still more fully so in the next life, see <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>. All of these things, distinguished as described into separate degrees and existing in relation to one another in the order shown, are called 
spiritual. The spiritual things of faith constitute all truths that stem from good, that is, from a celestial origin. Whatever derives from the celestial is one of the spiritual things of faith. </p>

`Et peregrinatus est in Gerar': quod significet instructione inde in spiritualibus fidei, constat a significatione `peregrinari' quod sit instrui, de qua n. 1463, 2025; et a significatione `Geraris' 
quod spirituale fidei: Gerar nominatur aliquibus in locis in Generi, ut x 19; xxvi 1, 6, 17, 20, 26, ac in illis significat fidem, et hoc ex causa quia Gerar erat in Philistaea, et per `Philistaeam' 
significatur scientia cognitionum fidei, videatur n. 1197, 1198; et Gerar erat ubi ipse rex Philistaeorum habitabat, inde est quod per `Gerarem' significetur ipsa fides, n. 1209; perque `regem Geraris' 
ipsum verum fidei, nam `rex' in sensu interno est verum, n. 1672, 2015, 2069; ita per `Abimelechum' doctrina fidei, de quo in sequentibus.  Sunt in genere intellectualia fidei, sunt rationalia fidei, 
et sunt scientifica fidei; ordine sibi ita ab interioribus ad exteriora procedunt; quae fidei intima sunt vocantur intellectualia; quae ex illis aut inde procedunt, sunt fidei rationalia; quae ex his 
iterum sunt fidei scientifica; se habent illa ut cum eruditis loquendum, sicut prius ad posterius, aut quod idem, sicut superius ad inferius, hoc est, sicut interius ad exterius: apparet quidem homini, 
sicut scientificum fidei sit primum, et ex illo dein existat rationale, et demum intellectuale, et hoc ex causa quia homo ita a pueritia procedit, sed usque intellectuale continue influit rationale, 
et hoc in scientificum, quod homo nescit; sed in pueritia obscure, in adultiore aetate evidentius, et tandem cum regeneratus est homo luculenter; apud hunc apparet quod talis ordo sit, et adhuc plenius 
in altera vita, videatur n. 1495; haec omnia vocantur spiritualis, quae distinguuntur ita in gradus, et ordine tali succedunt; spiritualia fidei sunt omnia vera quae ex bono, hoc est, ex origine 
caelesti; quicquid est ex caelesti derivatum, est spirituale fidei. </p>
