<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2966节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2966.</strong>“四百舍客勒银子”表救赎的代价。这在前面有所说明（<a href="2959.htm">2959</a>节），现阐明何为救赎的代价。救赎唯独属于主，救赎的代价也是。不过，救赎的代价也可论及人的接受度，对人来说，救赎的代价取决于他的接受程度。救赎的代价是主通过最严厉的试探所获得的功与义（merit and righteousness），主藉这些试探将人性本质与神性本质、神性本质与人性本质融合起来，并且做这一切全凭自己的力量。祂凭这融合拯救了人类，尤其拯救了那些属于属灵教会的人。主通过最严厉的试探变成公义（参看<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>-<a href="2027.htm">2027</a>节）；主将人性本质与神性本质，并神性本质与人性本质融合起来（参看<a href="1725.htm">1725</a>，<a href="1729.htm">1729</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>节）；祂做这一切全凭自己的力量（参看<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2026.htm">2026</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2500.htm">2500</a>，<a href="2523.htm">2523</a>，<a href="2632.htm">2632</a>节）；祂凭这融合拯救了人类，尤其拯救了那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>节）。这些就是救赎的代价所表示的事。<br />这种代价也可论及人的接受度，对人来说，这种代价取决于他的接受程度。这从以下事实明显看出来：正是主的神性构成人所具有的教会。因为凡不是主自己的东西都不被视为教会。正是爱与仁之善和信之真构成那被称为教会的。众所周知，一切良善皆来自主，一切真理也皆来自祂。从人而来的善与真并非善与真。由此明显可知，对于人来说，救赎的代价取决于他的接受程度。<br />主的救赎在犹太人当中被如此低估，以至于什么也不是，故在撒迦利亚书，经上说：<br />我对他们说：在你们眼里若为美，就给我工价。不然，就罢了！于是他们秤了三十块银钱作为我的工价。耶和华对我说，把它丢给窑户。那是他们估定我的好价钱！（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.12.htm">11:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.13.htm">13</a>）.<br />马太福音：<br />他们取了那三十锭银子，就是被估定、从以色列人那里所买之人的价钱，用它们买了窑户的一块田，这是照着主所吩咐我的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.9.htm">27:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.10.htm">10</a>）.<br />“三十”表如此之少，以至于几乎什么也不是（参看<a href="2276.htm">2276</a>节）。因此，这段经文的意思是，犹太人视主的功德与救赎为无物，而对那些相信一切良善与一切真理皆来自主的人来说，“四十”表救赎的代价，“四百”则表更高程度的救赎代价。</p>

Four hundred shekels of silver. That this signifies the price of redemption, was shown above (n. 2959); but what the price of redemption is shall now be told. Redemption is of the Lord alone, and so 
too is the price of redemption; and this price is also predicated of the reception by man, with whom the price is great according to the reception. The price of redemption is the Lord's merit and righteousness 
through the most grievous temptations, whereby He united the Human Essence to the Divine, and the Divine Essence to the Human, and this by His own power; and by this unition saved the human 
race, and especially those who are of the spiritual church. (That the Lord was made righteousness through the most grievous temptations, may be seen above, n. 1813, 2025-2027; also that He united the 
Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and the Divine to the Human, n. 1725, 1729, 1733, 1737, 1813, 2083; and that He did this from His own power, n. 1616, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2500, 2523, 2632; and 
by this unition saved the human race, and especially those who are of the spiritual church, n. 2661, 2716.) These are the things which are signified by the "price of redemption." [2] That this price 
is also predicated of the reception with man, with whom it is great in proportion to his reception, is evident from the fact that it is the Lord's Divine which makes the church with man; for nothing 
is called the church that is not the Lord's own; for it is the good which is of love and charity, and it is the truth which is of faith, which make that which is called the church. That all good is from 
the Lord, and that all truth is from Him, is well known; good and truth that are from man are not good and truth; and from this it is plain that the price of redemption with a man is great in proportion 
to his reception. [3] As with the Jews the Lord's redemption was so little esteemed as to be scarcely anything, it is said in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I said unto them, If it be good in your eyes, give 
me my hire, and if not, forbear. And they weighed my hire, thirty pieces of silver. And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was priced at of them (Zech. 11:12-13). And 
in Matthew: </p>
<p>     They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was priced, whom they had bought from the sons of Israel, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed 
me (Matt. 27:9-10). That "thirty" denotes what is so little as to be scarcely anything, may be seen above (n. 2276); thus this passage denotes that the Jews placed no value on the merit and redemption 
of the Lord. But with those who believe all good and all truth to be from the Lord, the price of redemption is signified by "forty," and in a higher degree by "four hundred." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2966</b></p><p><b>2966.</b>
'Four hundred shekels of silver' means the price of redemption, as has been shown above in <a href="2959.htm">2959</a>. But what the price of redemption is will now be stated. Redemption is attributable to the Lord alone, 
and so also is the price of redemption. Yet the latter may also be spoken of in reference to man's receptivity, though with him the price of redemption is determined by the measure of his receptivity. 
The price of redemption is the Lord's merit and righteousness acquired through the severest temptations by which He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and the Divine Essence to the Human 
Essence, doing so by His own power. And through that uniting of them He has saved the human race, especially those who belong to the spiritual Church. </p>
<p>For the Lord's becoming righteousness through 
the severest temptations, see <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>-<a href="2027.htm">2027</a>. </p>
<p>For the Lord's uniting of the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and the Divine Essence to the Human Essence, <a href="1725.htm">1725</a>, <a href="1729.htm">1729</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>. </p>
<p>For 
His doing this by His own power, <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2500.htm">2500</a>, <a href="2523.htm">2523</a>, <a href="2632.htm">2632</a>. </p>
<p>And for His salvation of the human race, especially those who belong to the spiritual Church, through that uniting 
of both, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>. </p>
<p>These are the factors meant by the price of redemption. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the consideration that this price may also be spoken of in reference to man's receptivity, though 
with him that price is determined by the measure of his receptivity, this may be seen from the truth that it is the Lord's Divine which constitutes the Church with man. For the Church does not hearken 
to anything except that which is the Lord's own. It is the good of love and charity, and the truth of faith, that constitute that which is called the Church. For it is well known that all good comes 
from the Lord and that all truth comes from the Lord. Good and truth that come from man are not good and truth. From this it is evident that the price of redemption is with man determined by the measure 
of his receptivity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because among the Jews the Lord's redemption was rated so low as to be scarcely anything at all, it is therefore said in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I said to them, If it is good in your 
eyes, give me my wages; and if not, withhold them. And they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver. And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price I was valued at among 
them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2011:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 11:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him whom they had bought from the children of Israel, and gave them for the potter's field, as the 
Lord commanded me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2027:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 27:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Thirty' is that which is so little as to be scarcely anything, see <a href="2276.htm">2276</a>. Thus the meaning is that the Jews rated the Lord's merit and redemption as nothing, but 
among those who believed that all good and all truth came from the Lord, the price of redemption is meant by 'forty' and to a higher degree by 'four hundred'. </p>

`Quadringentos siclos argenti': quod significet redemptionis pretium, supra n. 2959 ostensum est, sed quid redemptionis pretium, {1}dicetur; redemptio est solius Domini, ita quoque redemptionis pretium; 
et hoc praedicatur etiam de receptione apud hominem, apud quem redemptionis pretium tantum est quantum recipit: redemptionis pretium est Domini meritum et justitia per gravissimas tentationes, per 
quas univit Essentiam Humanam Divinae et Divinam Humanae, et hoc ex propria potentia, et per unitionem illam salvavit genus humanum, ac imprimis illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt; quod Dominus justitia 
factus per gravissimas tentationes, videatur n. 1813, 2025, 2026, 2027; quod univerit Essentiam Humanam Divinae et Divinam Humanae, n. 1725, 1729, 1733, 1737, 1813, 2083; quod ex propria potentia, 
n. 1616, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2500, 2523, 2632; et quod per unitionem illam salvaverit genus humanum, ac imprimis illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, n. 2661, 2716; haec sunt quae significantur 
per redemptionis pretium: [2] quod etiam id praedicetur de receptione apud hominem, apud quem tantum est quantum is recipit, constare potest ex eo quod Divinum Domini sit quod apud hominem facit Ecclesiam, 
nihil enim audit Ecclesia quam quod est proprium Domini; est bonum quod amoris et charitatis, et est verum quod fidei, quae faciunt id quod Ecclesia dicitur; quod omne bonum a Domino et quod omne 
verum a Domino, notum est; bonum et verum quod ab homine, non est bonum et verum; inde patet quod redemptionis pretium tantum sit apud hominem quantum is recipit: [3] apud Judaeos, quoniam redemptio 
Domini tam parum aestimata fuit, ut vix esset aliquid, ideo dicitur apud Zachariam,           Dixi ad illos, Si bonum in oculis vestris, date      mercedem meam, et si non, omittite; et appenderunt 
mercedem      meam, triginta argenteos, et dixit Jehovah ad me, Projice      illud ad figulum, magnificentiam pretii, quo aestimatus sum      apud illos, xi 12, 13: </p>
<p>et apud Matthaeum,           
Sumpserunt triginta argenteos, pretium aestimati, quem      emerant a filiis Israelis, et dederunt pro agro figuli, sicut      praecepit mihi Dominus, xxvii 10 [A.V. 9, 10]; </p>
<p>`triginta' quod sit parum 
ut vix aliquid, videatur n. 2276; ita quod judaei non aestimaverint quicquam meritum et redemptionem Domini; at qui credunt omne bonum et omne verum a Domino, apud illos redemptionis pretium significatur 
per `quadraginta,' et in superiore gradu per `quadringenta.' @1 nondum dictum est$  </p>
