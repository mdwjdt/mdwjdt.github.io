<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1468节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1468.</strong>“就对他妻子撒莱说”表祂如此思想与属天事物联结的真理。这从称作妻子的“撒莱”的含义清楚可知，从圣言的内义上说，“妻子”无非表示与良善结合的真理，因为真理与良善的结合恰如婚姻。在圣言中，当提及“丈夫”时，丈夫就表良善，妻子表真理；但若他没有被称为“丈夫”，而是被称为男人，他就表真理，而妻子表良善：这是圣言一贯的用法，如前所述（<a href="915.htm">915</a>节）。由于本节经文提到“亚伯兰”，故“他妻子撒莱”表真理。“就对他妻子撒莱说”的内义是指祂如此思想与属天事物联结的真理。亚伯兰旅居到埃及时，就是如此对他的妻子说的，这在历史上也是真实的；不过，如前所述，圣言中所记载的所有历史事件都具有代表性，每句话都具有属灵之义。若非在内义上可以表达这些奥秘，圣言不会记载任何历史，也不会以这样的顺序、这样的话来表述它们。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1468.</strong> That he said to Sarai his wife means that these were his thoughts about the truth to which heavenly qualities are attached, as can be seen from the symbolism of Sarai when she is called a wife. What a wife actually means in the Word's inner sense is truth united with goodness, because the bond between truth and goodness is no different than a marriage. When the Word speaks of a husband by name, he symbolizes what is good and his wife symbolizes truth. When it does not name the husband but calls him a man, however, he symbolizes truth and his wife symbolizes what is good.{*1} The Word is consistent in this respect, as was noted earlier, at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a>. Because Abram is mentioned by name in this chapter, Sarai his wife symbolizes truth. So saying something to Sarai his wife, in an inner sense, is thinking such-and-such about the truth to which heavenly qualities are united.<br />It is historically true that Abram spoke this way to his wife when he set out for Egypt, but as mentioned already, all the historical events of the Word are representative, while all the words are symbolic [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1401" target=_top>1401-1409</a>]. What was recorded was confined to the events, sequence, and wording that would express those secrets in an inner sense.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} A simplified version of the symbolic system pertaining to married couples in Swedenborg's exegesis is as follows: 1. Where the husband is referred to either by personal name or by the term "husband," he symbolizes good and his wife symbolizes truth (besides this section, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2517" target=_top>2517</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2581" target=_top>2581</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3236" target=_top>3236</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4510" target=_top>4510</a>). 2. Where the husband is referred to by the term "man," he symbolizes truth and she symbolizes good (besides this section, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2517" target=_top>2517</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2581" target=_top>2581</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4510" target=_top>4510</a>). 3. Where the husband is referred to as "human," he symbolizes love and she symbolizes faith (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a>).

He said to Sarai his wife. That this signifies that He so thought concerning the truths to which celestial things were adjoined, is evident from the signification of Sarai when she is called a wife. 
A "wife," in the internal sense of the Word, signifies nothing else than truth conjoined with good; for the conjunction of truth with good is circumstanced precisely as is a marriage. In the Word, when 
a "husband" is mentioned, the husband signifies good, and the wife signifies truth; but when he is not called the husband, but the "man," then he signifies truth, and the wife signifies good: this is 
the constant usage in the Word, as before said (n. 915). In the passage before us, as Abram is named, Sarai his wife signifies truth. To say thus to Sarai his wife is, in the internal sense, to think 
so concerning the truths with which celestial things were conjoined. It is historically true that Abram so said to his wife, when journeying into Egypt; but as before said, all the historicals of the 
Word are representative, and all the words are significative. No other historicals are recorded in the Word, and in no other order, and no other words are used to express them, than such as in the internal 
sense may express these arcana. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1468</b></p><p><b>1468.</b>
'That he said to Sarai his wife' means that He thought in the following way about truths to which celestial things were allied. This is clear from the meaning of 'Sarai' when she is called 'a wife'. 
In the internal sense of the Word 'a wife' means nothing other than truth joined to good, for truth joined to good is altogether like a marriage. When the noun 'husband' (maritus) is used in the Word 
it means good and 'wife' means truth. But when instead of this another noun for 'husband' (vir) is used, it in that case means truth, and 'wife' means good; and this is a consistent usage in the Word, 
as also stated already in <a href="915.htm">915</a> Since 'Abram' has been mentioned by name in this passage, 'Sarai his wife' means truth. Thus the meaning of 'he said to Sarai his wife' is in the internal sense that He 
thought in the following way about truths to which celestial things were allied. It is true historically that when he travelled into Egypt Abram spoke to his wife in this way; but, as has been stated, 
all the historical events recorded in the Word are representative and every word carries a spiritual meaning. No other historical details have been brought in, and those that have are not presented in 
any other sequence, nor expressed in any other words than such as in the internal sense may express these arcana. </p>

'Et dixit ad Sarai uxorem suam': quod significet quod ita cogitavit de veris quibus caelestia adjuncta, constat ex significatione 'Sarai' cum nominatur 'uxor'; uxor in sensu interno Verbi non aliud 
significat quam verum conjunctum bono, nam conjunctio veri cum bono non aliter se habet ac conjugium; cum nominatur maritas in Verbo, tunc 'maritus' significat bonum et 'uxor' verum, sed cum non nominatur 
maritus sed dicitur 'vir,' tunc ille significat verum et 'uxor' bonum, et hoc constanter in Verbo, ut quoque dictum prius n. 915; hic quia Abram nominatus, 'Sarai uxor' significat verum: ita 'dicere 
ad Sarai uxorem' in sensu interno est ita cogitare de veris quibus caelestia conjuncta.  Historica vera sunt quod Abram sic dixit uxori suae cum profectus in Aegyptum, sed ut dictum, omnia historica 
Verbi sunt repraesentativa et omnia verba sunt significativa; historica non alia allata sunt, nec alio ordine, nec verba exprimentia alia, quam quae in sensu interno arcana illa exprimerent. </p>
