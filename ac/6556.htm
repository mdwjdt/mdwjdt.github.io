Verses 15-21. And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, and they said, Peradventure Joseph will hate us, and returning will return unto us all the evil that we requited to him. And they commanded 
Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, Thus shall ye say unto Joseph, I pray forgive I pray the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, because they requited evil 
to thee; and now forgive I pray the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. And his brethren also went and fell down before him; and they said, 
Behold we are thy servants. And Joseph said unto them, Fear ye not; for am I in God's stead? And you thought evil upon me, but God thought it for good, in order to do as it is this day, to make alive 
a great people. And now fear ye not; I will sustain you, and your babes; and he comforted them, and spake upon their heart.  "And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead," signifies the 
things alienated from truth and good, and a perception that the church was resuscitated; "and they said, Peradventure Joseph will hate us," signifies that they had rejected the internal; "and returning 
will return unto us all the evil that we requited to him," signifies the penalty therefore impending according to the desert; "and they commanded Joseph, saying," signifies influx from the internal 
and the consequent perception; "Thy father did command before he died, saying," signifies that it is by command of the church; "Thus shall ye say unto Joseph," signifies perception from the internal what 
ought to be done; "I pray forgive I pray the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin," signifies supplication and repentance; "because they requited evil to thee," signifies that they had turned 
away from the good and truth which flow in; "and now forgive I pray the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father," signifies repentance and acknowledgment of the Divine things of the 
church; "and Joseph wept when they spake unto him," signifies reception from love; "and his brethren also went and fell down before him," signifies the submission of the things that are in the natural 
under the internal; "and they said, Behold, we are thy servants," signifies that they shall not be at their own disposal; "and Joseph said unto them, Fear ye not," signifies re-creation by the internal; 
"for am I in God's stead?" signifies that God will provide; "and you thought evil upon me," signifies that the things alienated intend nothing but evil; "God thought it for good," signifies that 
the Divine turns it into good; "in order to do as it is this day," signifies that this is according to order from eternity; "to make alive a great people," signifies that from this is life to those who 
are in the truths of good; "and now fear ye not," signifies that they should not be anxious; "I will sustain you, and your babes," signifies that they will live through the internal from the Divine 
by means of the truth that is of the understanding and the good that is of the will; "and he comforted them," signifies hope; "and spake upon their heart," signifies trust. </p>

Verses 15-21 And Joseph's brothers saw that their father had died, and they said, Perhaps Joseph will hate us and will fully return to us all the evil with which we repaid him. And they gave a command 
to Joseph, saying, Your father commanded before he died, saying, Thus you are to say to Joseph, I beg you, forgive - I beg you - the transgression of your brothers, and their sin, for the evil with 
which they repaid you; and now forgive, I beg you, the transgression of the servants of your father's God. And Joseph wept as they spoke to him. And his brothers also went and fell down before him, and 
said, Behold, we are your slaves. And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? And you thought evil against me; God thought [to turn] it into good, in order to do what is 
in accord with this day, to bestow life on a great people. And now, do not be afraid; I will sustain you and your young children. And he consoled them and spoke to their heart. </p>
<p>'And Joseph's brothers 
saw that their father had died' means the things which had become alienated from truth and good, and a discernment that the Church had been restored to life. 'And they said, Perhaps Joseph will hate 
us' means that they rejected the internal. 'And will fully return to us all the evil with which we repaid him' means that a punishment as merited is therefore impending. 'And they gave a command to 
Joseph, saying' means influx from the internal and the consequent perception. 'Your father commanded before he died, saying' means that it is by the command of the Church. 'Thus you are to say to Joseph' 
means perception from the internal about what was to be done. 'I beg you, forgive - I beg you - the transgression of your brothers, and their sin' means supplication and repentance. 'For the evil 
with which they repaid you means that they had become turned away from inflowing goodness and truth. 'And now forgive, I beg you, the transgression of the servants of your father's God' means repentance, 
and an acknowledgement of the Divine things of the Church. 'And Joseph wept as they spoke to him' means reception brought about by love. 'And his brothers also went and fell down before him' means 
the submission of the things in the natural to the internal. 'And said, Behold, we are your slaves' means that they will not be their own master. 'And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid' means renewal 
by the internal. 'For am I in the place of God?' means that God will provide. 'And you thought evil against me' means that the things which have become alienated intend nothing but evil. 'God thought 
[to turn] it into good' means that the Divine turns it into good. 'In order to do what is in accord with this day' means that this is in accord with order from eternity. 'To bestow life on a great 
people' means that life is thereby imparted to those governed by the truths of good 'And now, do not be afraid' means that they should not be anxious. 'I will sustain you and your young children' means 
that they will have life from the Divine by way of the internal, through truth which is of the understanding and good which is of the will. 'And he consoled them' means hope. 'And spoke to their 
heart' means trust. </p>

Vers. 15-21.  Et viderunt fratres Josephi quod mortuus pater illorum, et dixerunt, Fortassis odio habebit nos Joseph, et reducendo reducet nobis omne malum quod retribuimus illi.  Et praeceperunt ad 
Josephum, dicendo, Pater tuis praecepit ante mori eum, dicendo.  Ita dicatis ad Josephum, Quaeso remitte quaeso praevaricationem fratrum tuorum, et peccatum illorum, quia malum retribuerunt tibi; et 
nunc remitte quaeso praevaricationem servorum Dei patris tui; et flevit Joseph in loqui illos ad eum.  Et iverunt etiam fratres ejus, et ceciderunt coram eo, et dixerunt, Ecce nos tibi ad servos.  Et 
dixit ad illos Joseph, Ne timeatis, quia num pro Deo ego?  Et vos cogitastis super me malum, Deus cogitavit id ad bonum propter facere secundum diem hunc, ad vivificandum populum magnum.  Et nunc ne timeatis, 
ego sustentabo vos, et infantes vestros; et consolatus illos, et locutus super cor illorum. `Et viderunt fratres Josephi quod mortuus pater illorum' significat abalienata a vero et bono, et apperceptionem 
quod exsuscitata Ecclesia: `et dixerunt, Fortassis odio habebit nos Joseph' significat quod internum rejecerint: `et reducendo reducet nobis omne malum quod retribuimus illi' significat

ab Ecclesiae praecepto: `Ita dicatis ad Josephum' significat perceptionem ab interno quid faciendum: `Quaeso remitte quaeso praevaricationem fratrum tuorum, et peccatum illorum' significat supplicationem 
et paenitentiam:  `quia malum retribuerunt tibi' significat quod aversi fuerint a bono et vero quae influunt: `et nunc {2} remitte quaeso praevaricationem servorum Dei patris tui' significat paenitentiam 
et agnitionem Divinorum Ecclesiae: `et flevit Joseph in loqui illos ad eum' significat receptionem ex amore: `et iverunt etiam fratres (x)ejus, et ceciderunt coram eo' significat submissionem 
illorum quae in naturali sub interno: `et dixerunt, Ecce nos tibi ad servos' significat quod sui juris non erunt: `et dixit ad illos Joseph, Ne timeatis' significat recreationem ab interno: `quia num 
pro Deo ego' significat quod Deus providebit: `et vos cogitastis super me malum' significat quod quae abalienata nihil nisi malum intendant: `Deus cogitavit id in bonum' significat quod Divinum vertat 
id in bonum: `propter facere secundum diem hunc' significat quod id secundum ordinem ab aeterno: `ad vivificandum populum magnum' significat quod inde vita illis qui in veris boni: `et nunc ne timeatis' 
significat ne solliciti sint: `ego sustentabo vos, et infantes vestros' significat quod victuri per internum a Divino per verum quod intellectus et bonum quod voluntatis: `et consolatus illos' (x)significat
