And the land could not sustain them, to [allow them to] live together, because their gain was large and they could not live together.<br />The land could not sustain them, to [allow them to] live together, means that different aspects of his deeper, heavenly dimension could not coexist with those things. Because their gain was large and they could not live together means that the gains of his inner self were incompatible with gains of his outer self. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1567</b></p><p><b>1567.</b>
Verse 6. And the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together, because their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. "The land was not able to bear them that they 
might dwell together," signifies that the things belonging to the internal celestial things could not be together with the others; "because their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together," 
signifies that the things that had been acquired by the internal man could not agree with those acquired in the external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1567</b></p><p><b>1567.</b>
Verse 6 And the land was unable to bear them, that they might dwell together, for their acquisitions were great, and they could not dwell together. </p>
<p>'The land was unable to bear them, that they might 
dwell together' means that the things which belonged to the celestial internals could not remain together with the former ones. 'For their acquisitions were great, and they could not dwell together' 
means the things that were acquired by the internal man could not agree with those acquired in the external. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1567</b>
</p><b>1567.</b>
Vers. 6.  Et non ferebat illos terra ad habitandum simul, quia fuit acquisitio illorum magna, et non potuerunt habitare simul. 'Non ferebat illos terra ad habitandum simul' significat quod illa quae 
sunt caelestium internorum non possent simul esse cum illis: 'quia fuit acquisitio illorum magna et non potuerunt habitare simul' significat quae acquisita sunt ab interno homine, cum illis quae acquisita 
in externo, non possent concordare. </p>
