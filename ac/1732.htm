<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1732节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1732.</strong>“说，愿至高的神赐福与亚伯兰”表主的内层人进入来自其内在人的良善享受中。这同样从“赐福”、“亚伯兰”和“至高神”的含义清楚可知：“赐福”是指享受一切良善，如前所述；“亚伯兰”在此是指内层人，或理性人，如13节所述；前面还说过，“至高神”是指主的内在人。如前所述，“亚伯兰”表要与内在人，或耶和华结合的内层人或理性人，这结合通过试探的争战和胜利实现。事实上，内层人的情况是这样：就象前面说的，内层人介于内在人和外在人之间，能使内在人流入外在人。没有内层人，就没有交流，因而属天和属灵之物的交流就不会产生。当这交流是属天之物的交流时，内层人就被称为“麦基洗德”；但当是属灵之物的交流时，内层人就被称为“希伯来人亚伯兰”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1732.</strong> A blessing on Abram from God the Highest means that the Lord's intermediate self enjoyed benefits from his inner self. This too can be seen from the symbolism of a blessing as, again, the enjoyment of benefits. It can also be seen from the symbolism here of Abram as the intermediate or rational self, discussed above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>13</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1702" target=_top>1702</a>], and can also be seen from the symbolism of God the Highest as the Lord's inner dimension, also discussed earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1311#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1311:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729" target=_top>1729</a>].<br />Abram, as noted, symbolizes the Lord's intermediate or rational self, which was to become one with his inner self (Jehovah), by means of spiritual battles and victories.<br />The case with the intermediate self is this: The intermediate self, as noted, is midway between the inner and outer selves and makes it possible for the inner self to exert an influence on the outer self [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1702" target=_top>1702</a>]. Without it there is no communication. Heavenly and spiritual properties are what are communicated. When something heavenly comes through, the intermediate self is called Melchizedek, but when something spiritual does, it is called Abram the Hebrew. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1732</b></p><p><b>1732.</b>
Blessed be Abram to God Most High. That this signifies the Lord's interior man, that it came into the enjoyment of goods from His internal man, is in like manner evident from the signification of "blessing" 
as being the enjoyment of goods, as before said; also from the signification of "Abram" here, as being the interior or rational man, treated of above (at verse 13); and also from the signification 
of "God Most High," as being the Lord's internal, which subject also has been treated of before. By "Abram," as before said, is signified the interior or rational man which is to be united to the 
internal man or Jehovah, and this by the combats of temptations and victories. For with the interior man the case is as follows. The interior man, as before said, is intermediate between the internal 
and the external man, and enables the internal man to flow into the external; for without the interior man there is no communication. There is thus effected a communication of celestial things, and of 
spiritual. When the communication was of celestial things, the interior man was called "Melchizedek;" but when there is a communication of spiritual things, it is called "Abram the Hebrew." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1732</b></p><p><b>1732.</b>
'Blessed be Abram by God Most High' means that the Lord's Interior Man had the enjoyment of goods coming from His Internal Man. Similarly, this is clear from the meaning of 'blessing' as having the enjoyment 
of goods, as has been stated; also from the meaning of 'Abram' here as the Interior or Rational Man, dealt with above at verse 13; and then from the meaning of 'God Most High' as the Lord's Internal 
Man, also dealt with already. 'Abram', as has been stated, means the Interior or Rational Man, which was to be united to the Internal Man, or Jehovah, which union was accomplished through the 
conflicts that constituted temptations, and through victories. Indeed the situation with the Interior Man is that the Interior Man, as has been stated, is situated between the Internal Man and External 
Man, and enables the Internal Man to flow into the External. Without that Interior Man no communication takes place, and when it does take place it is a communication of celestial and spiritual things. 
When the communication was one of celestial things, the Interior Man was called 'Melchizedek', but when the communication was one of spiritual things it is called 'Abram the Hebrew'. </p>

</p><b>1732.</b>
'Benedictus Abram Deo Altissimo':  quod significet Interiorem Hominem Domini quod fruitio bonorum ab Ipsius Interno, constat similiter a significatione 'benedictionis' quod sit fruitio bonorum, ut dictum; 
tum a significatione 'Abrami' hic quod sit Interior seu Rationalis Homo, de qua supra ad vers. 13; tum a significatione 'Dei Altissimi' quod sit Internum Domini, de qua re etiam prius: per 'Abramum' 
significatur, ut dictum, Interior seu Rationalis Homo, qui Interno seu Jehovae uniendus, et hoc per pugnas tentationum et victorias: ita enim se habet cum Interiore Homine; Interior Homo, ut dictum, 
est medius inter Internum et Externum, et facit ut Internus influere possit in Externum, absque illo nulla communicatio; communicatio fit caelestium et spiritualium; cum communicatio caelestium, 
Interior Homo appellatus est 'Malkizedech,' cum autem communicatio spiritualium appellatur 'Abram Hebraeus.' </p>
