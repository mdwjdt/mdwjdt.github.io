<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9094节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9094.</strong>“也要平分死牛”表伤害性的情感也将被驱散。这从“死物”和“分”的含义清楚可知：“死物”是指邪恶和虚假，如前所述（<a href="9008.htm">9008</a>节），因此，“死牛”表示属世人中对邪恶和虚假的情感，因而表示一种伤害性的情感，因为邪恶通过虚假造成伤害；“分”是指驱散（<a href="9093.htm">9093</a>节）。包含在本节内义中的事物不容易解释明白。它们都是诸如能被天使理解，但只能在某种程度上被世人理解的那类事物。因为天使在从主流出的光中看见圣言的奥秘；在这光中，无数事物变得可见，这些事物都是无法用语言来表达的，甚至在人活在肉身时无法进入人所能领受的思维观念。原因是，对世人来说，天堂之光流入世界之光，从而流入那里诸如要么消灭、要么弃绝天堂之光、要么使这光变暗，由此削弱它的那类事物，这些事物就是世俗和肉体的挂怀，尤其是从对自我和世界的爱所流出的挂怀。正因如此，属于天使智慧的觉知在很大程度上无法描述，也无法理解。<br />然而，人在抛弃肉体，也就是死后就会进入这种智慧；不过，只有在世时从主接受信与仁的生命之人才能进入。因为接受天使智慧的能力就在信与仁之良善里面。大量经历使我得知，天使在天堂之光中所看见并思想的事物是无法描述的。当我被提升到这光中时，觉得自己似乎明白了天使在那里所说的一切。但当我从那里被降到外在人或属世人的光中，并在这光中想要回想起我在那里所听到的事物时，却无法用语言来表达，甚至无法通过思维观念来理解它们，除了少数事物之外，连这些少数事物也只能以一种模糊的方式来理解。由此明显可知，在天堂所看见并听见的事物都是诸如眼睛未曾看见、耳朵未曾听见的。<br />从至内在隐藏于圣言内义中的事物就是这个样子。本节和下一节中的内义内容也是这种情况。那里的事物能被解释明白的是这些：与人同在的一切真理都从属于某种爱的情感那里拥有生命。真理若没有来自爱的生命，就像从没有一个观念的嘴里发出的声音，或像机械人发出的声音。由此明显可知，人的理解力的生命来自他的意愿的生命；因此，真理的生命来自良善的生命；因为真理占据理解力，良善占据意愿。因此，如果有两种不从同一种总体情感，而是从不同的情感接受自己生命的真理存在，那么它们必被驱散，因为它们彼此冲突。当真理被驱散时，它们所属的情感也被驱散。因为有一种总体情感将与人同在的一切真理都聚拢它在下面；这种总体情感就是良善。这些就是关于两个人的牛，其中一只牛击伤另一只牛，以致它死，现在活牛被卖掉，价银被平分，死牛也被平分在内义上所表示的能被阐明的一切。<br />凡属教会的，谁不知道圣言的每一个细节都是神性？但如果只是按照字义来考虑并解释关于牛和驴掉在坑里，以及牛用角抵触的律法，谁又能在这些律法中看见任何神性事物？然而，这些律法都是神性，甚至在字义上也是，只要同时在内义上来考虑并解释它们，因为就内义而言，圣言的每一个细节都在论述主，祂的国度和教会，因而论述神性事物。事实上，任何事物若要是神性和神圣的，就必须论述神性和神圣的主题；所论述的主题使它这样。世俗和民间的规定，如主从西乃山上所宣布并包含在出埃及记的这一章和随后几章中的典章、律例和律法，都是经由灵感而来的神性，是神圣的。然而，灵感（inspiration）不是口述，而是来自神性的流注。从神性流入之物都经过天堂，在那里它是属天和属灵的。但当它进入世界时，就变成世俗的，然而含有属天和属灵之物在里面。由此明显可知圣言的神性源自哪里，在圣言中居于何处，以及何为灵感（inspiration）。</p>

And the dead one also they shall divide. That this signifies that the injuring affection also shall be dissipated, is evident from the signification of what is "dead," as being evil and falsity (of which 
above, n. 9008); consequently by "a dead ox" is signified the affection of evil and falsity in the natural man, thus an injuring affection, for evil injures by means of falsity; and from the signification 
of "to divide," as being to dissipate (n. 9093). How the case is with the things contained in this verse in the internal sense can with difficulty be unfolded to the apprehension. They are such 
as can be comprehended by the angels, and only in some measure by men. For the angels see the arcana of the Word in the light which is from the Lord, in which light innumerable things are presented 
to view that do not fall into the words of speech, and not even into the ideas of thought, with men so long as they live in the body. The reason is that with men the light of heaven flows into the light 
of the world, and thus into such things there as either extinguish, or reject, or darken, and thus deaden it. The cares of the world and of the body are such things, especially those which flow from 
the loves of self and of the world. From this it is that the things which are of angelic wisdom are for the most part unutterable, and also incomprehensible. [2] Nevertheless man comes into such 
wisdom after the laying aside of the body, that is, after death; but only the man who has received in the world the life of faith and charity from the Lord; for the capacity of receiving angelic wisdom 
is in the good of faith and of charity. That the things which the angels see and think in the light of heaven are unutterable, has been given me to know by much experience; for when I have been raised 
into that light, I have seemed to myself to understand all those things which the angels there spoke; but when I have been let down from thence into the light of the external or natural man, and in 
this light have desired to recollect the things which I had there heard, I could not express them by words, and not even comprehend them by ideas of thought, except a few, and these few obscurely; from 
which it is manifest that the things which are seen and heard in heaven are such as the eye hath not seen nor the ear heard. [3] Such are the things which lie inmostly hidden in the internal sense 
of the Word; and it is the same with the things contained in the internal sense in this and the following verses. The things therein contained which can be explained to the apprehension are these. All 
truths in man have life from the affections which are of some love. Truth without life from love is like sound flowing forth from the mouth without an idea, or like the sound of an automaton. Hence 
it is plain that the life of man's understanding is from the life of his will, consequently that the life of truth is from the life of good; for truth bears relation to the understanding, and good to 
the will. If therefore there are two truths which do not live from the same general affection, but from diverse affections, they must needs be dissipated, for they are in collision with each other. And 
when truths are dissipated, their affections also are dissipated; for there is a general affection under which all the truths with a man are associated together. This general affection is good. This 
is all that can be told about what is signified in the internal sense by the oxen of two men, one of which strikes the other so that he dies, the living ox then being sold, and the silver divided, and 
also the dead ox. [4] Who that is of the church does not know that there are Divine things in each and all things of the Word? But who can see Divine things in these laws about oxen and asses falling 
into a pit, and about oxen striking with the horn, if they are regarded and explained merely according to the sense of the letter? Nevertheless they are Divine even in the sense of the letter, provided 
they are regarded and unfolded at the same time in respect to the internal sense; for in this sense each and all things of the Word treat of the Lord, of His Kingdom, and His church, thus of Divine 
things. For in order that anything may be Divine and holy, it must treat of Divine and holy things. The subject that is treated of effects this. The worldly and public affairs, such as are the judgments, 
statutes, and laws promulgated by the Lord from Mount Sinai, which are contained in this and in the following chapters of Exodus, are Divine and holy by inspiration; yet inspiration is not dictation, 
but is influx from the Divine. That which inflows from the Divine passes through heaven, and there is celestial and spiritual; but when it comes into the world it becomes worldly, within which 
is what is celestial and spiritual. From this it is plain whence and where is the Divine that is in the Word; and what is inspiration. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9094</b></p><p><b>9094.</b>
'And they shall also divide the dead one' means that the injuring affection as well will be dispersed. This is clear from the meaning of 'that which is dead' as evil and falsity, dealt with above in <a href="9008.htm">9008</a>, so that 'a dead ox' means an affection for evil and falsity in the natural, thus an injuring affection since evil causes injury by means of falsity; and from the meaning of 'dividing' as dispersing, 
as above in <a href="9093.htm">9093</a>. It is not easy to explain in a way that can be understood the nature of the matters contained in the internal sense of this verse. They are such as can be comprehended by angels, 
but only to some extent by men. For angels see the arcana of the Word in light that flows from the Lord; and in that light countless things are made visible which cannot be put into words, or even into 
mental pictures that a person could assimilate while living in the body. The reason for this is that with people in the world the light of heaven flows into the light of the world and so into such 
things there as either eliminate, reject, or darken and thereby weaken the light of heaven, such things being worldly and bodily cares, especially those that flow from self-love and love of the world. 
This is the reason why the perceptions belonging to angelic wisdom are for the most part beyond description and also beyond comprehension. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 However, a person enters into such wisdom after the body 
has been cast aside, that is, after death, but only the person who, when in the world, received the life of faith and charity from the Lord. The ability to receive that wisdom is held within the good 
of faith and charity. Much experience too has allowed me to know that the things which angels see and think about in the light of heaven are beyond description. When I have been raised into that light 
I have seemed to myself to understand everything the angels spoke there. But when I was brought down from there to the light of the external or natural man and in that light wished to recall the things 
I had heard there, I could not put them into words or even find ideas in my mind to embrace them, except for a few, and even these few in a dim manner. From all this it is evident that the things 
seen and heard in heaven are such as eye has never seen or ear heard. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is what the things that lie concealed inmostly in the internal sense of the Word are like. The situation is similar with 
the contents of the internal sense in this verse and the next. The things there which are capable of being explained and understood are these: All the truths present with a person possess life from 
affections belonging to some love or other. Truth without life from that source is like a sound emitted by the mouth without an idea behind it, or like a sound made by a mechanical man. From this it 
is evident that the life of a person's understanding comes from the life of his will, consequently the life of truth from the life of good, since truth occupies the understanding and good the will. If 
therefore two truths exist which do not receive their life from the same general affection but from dissimilar affections, they are inevitably dispersed since they clash with each other. And when truths 
are dispersed, the affections they belong to are dispersed as well. For there is a general affection, which brings all the truths present with a person together under it; and that general affection 
is good. These are the things that are capable of being stated regarding what is meant in the internal sense by two men's oxen, one of which inflicts a blow on the other ox, which as a result dies, 
and now by the stipulation that the living ox shall be sold, the silver shall be divided, and the dead ox too. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Is there anyone belonging to the Church who does not know that every detail of the 
Word is Divine? But can anyone see anything Divine in these laws regarding oxen and asses falling into a pit, and regarding oxen striking with their horn, if they are considered and explained only on 
the level of the sense of the letter? Yet those laws are Divine, even on this level, if at the same time they are considered and explained on the level of the internal sense, because on this level every 
detail of the Word refers to the Lord, His kingdom and Church, thus to things that are Divine. For if anything is to be Divine and holy it must refer to Divine and holy subjects; the subject to which 
it refers makes it such. The worldly and civil regulations, such as the judgements, statutes, and laws declared by the Lord from Mount Sinai and contained in this chapter of Exodus and those that 
follow, are Divine and holy through inspiration. But inspiration is not dictation; rather it is influx from the Divine. What flows in from the Divine passes through heaven, where it is celestial and 
spiritual. But when it enters the world it becomes worldly, yet holds within itself what is celestial and spiritual. From this it is evident where the Divinity of the Word springs from and where it resides 
in the Word, and what inspiration is. </p>

`Et etiam mortuum divident': quod significet quod etiam affectio laedens, constat ex significatione `mortui' quod sit malum ac falsum, de qua supra n. (x)9008, inde per `bovem mortuum' significatur 
affectio mali ac falsi {1} in naturali, ita affectio laedens, nam (o)malum per falsum laedit; et ex significatione `dividere' quod sit dissipare, ut {2} supra n. 9093.  Quomodo cum [his] quae in hoc versu 
in sensu interno (o)continentur se habet, aegre ad captum potest explicari; sunt talia quae ab angelis comprehendi possunt, et modo aliquo ab hominibus, nam angeli vident arcana Verbi in luce quae 
a Domino, in qua innumerabilia sistuntur videnda quae non cadunt in voces loquelae, et ne quidem in ideas cogitationis apud homines quamdiu in corpore vivunt; causa est quia apud homines lux caeli influit 
in lucem mundi et sic in talia ibi quae lucem caeli vel exstinguunt, vel rejiciunt, vel obtenebrant et sic hebetant; curae mundi ac corporis sunt talia, imprimis quae ex amoribus sui et mundi fluunt; 
inde est quod quae sapientiae angelicae sunt quoad plurimam partem sint inenuntiabilia et quoque incomprehensibilia; [2] sed usque in talem sapientiam venit homo post corporis rejectionem, hoc 
est, post mortem, (o)sed modo is homo qui vitam fidei et charitatis {3} a Domino in mundo receperat, nam facultas recipiendi illam sapientiam inest bono fidei et charitatis {3}; quod ineffabilia sint 
quae angeli in luce caeli vident et cogitant, a multa experientia etiam scire datum est, (o)nam cum elevatus sum in lucem illam, visus sum mihi intelligere omnia illa quae ibi angeli locuti sunt, at cum 
abinde in lucem externi seu naturalis hominis demissus sum, et in hac luce vellem recolligere illa quae ibi audivi, non potui illa per voces exprimere, et ne quidem per ideas cogitationis comprehendere, 
nisi pauca, et haec (t)pauca quoque in obscuro; ex quibus patet quod quae in caelo videntur et audiuntur sint talia quae nusquam {4} oculus vidit, nec {4} auris audivit. 	[3] Talia sunt quae in 
sensu interno Verbi intime latent.  Similiter se habet cum (c)iis quae in sensu interno in hoc versu et {5} sequente continentur; quae ibi sunt, et ad captum explicari possunt, sunt haec: omnia vera 
apud hominem vitam {6} habent (c)ex affectionibus quae amoris alicujus; verum absque vita inde, est sicut sonus ex ore effluens absque idea, aut sicut sonus automati; inde patet quod vita intellectus 
hominis sit a vita voluntatis ejus, proinde vita veri ex vita boni, nam verum se refert ad intellectum et bonum ad voluntatem; si ergo duo vera sunt quae non vivunt ab eadem affectione communi sed a diversis, 
illa non possunt aliter quam dissipari, nam collidunt inter se; et cum vera dissipantur, etiam affectiones illorum dissipantur; est enim communis affectio sub qua omnia vera apud hominem consociantur; 
communis illa affectio est bonum; haec sunt quae dici possunt de illis quae in (t)interno sensu significantur per `boves duorum virorum, quorum unus plaga afficit alterum, ut moriatur,' et quod 
tunc `bos vivus vendetur, et dividetur argentum, et quoque bos mortuus.' 	[4] Quis non scit qui ab Ecclesia, quod in omnibus et singulis Verbi sint Divina? sed quis Divina potest videre in his legibus 
de bobus et asinis cadentibus in foveam, et de bobus cornu ferientibus, si solum quoad sensum litterae inspiciuntur et explicantur? sed tunc Divina sunt, etiam in sensu litterae, si simul quoad 
sensum internum inspiciuntur et explicantur, nam in eo sensu agunt omnia et singula Verbi de Domino, de Ipsius regno et Ecclesia, ita de Divinis; ut enim aliquid Divinum et sanctum sit, de Divinis et 
sanctis aget; res de qua agitur, id facit; mundana et forensia, qualia sunt judicia, statuta, et leges a Domino e monte Sinai promulgata, quae in hoc capite [et in] sequentibus Exodi continentur, Divina 
et sancta sunt per inspirationem, sed inspiratio non est dictatio, sed est influxus ex Divino; quod influit ex Divino, hoc transit per caelum, et ibi est caeleste (c)ac spirituale; at cum venit in 
mundum, fit {7} mundanum in quo (o)intus illa sunt; inde patet unde Divinum et ubi Divinum (o)est in Verbo, et quid inspiratio. @1 d mali i falsi$ @2 i nunc$ @3 amoris$ @4  alicujus$ @5 i in$ @6
