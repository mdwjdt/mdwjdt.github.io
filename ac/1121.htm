<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1121节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1121.</strong>我从上古教会成员的儿子们那里得知他们这种直觉的状态，他们对属于信的一切事物有一种直觉，几乎与同他们交流的天使无异。因为他们的内在人，或灵也凭内呼吸与天堂联结，而对主之爱和对邻之爱里面带有天堂，天使就这样通过由这爱构成的真生命与人结合。他们说，律法写在他们里面，因为他们处于对主之爱和对邻之爱。正因如此，凡律法所规定的，皆与其直觉一致，凡律法所禁止的，皆与其直觉相背。他们也不怀疑，人的一切律法和神性律法一样，都基于对主之爱和对邻之仁，并视其为它们的基础。因此，由于他们通过主拥有这种基础，所以他们必然知道由它所产生的一切。他们还相信，现在的人若爱主爱邻，也会有写在他们里面的律法，并且如同在来世那样在世界各地成为值得接受的公民。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1121.</strong> The progeny of the earliest church have taught me about the level of perception they had enjoyed. They had possessed the ability to perceive any proposition of faith, almost to the same degree as angels, with whom they communicated. One reason was that their inner self — their spirit — was united to heaven by means of internal breathing. Another was that love for the Lord and love for one's neighbor carry this communication with them, because these two kinds of love unite people on earth with angels through the essential core of their life, which consists in such love. They said they had the law written in them{*1} because they loved the Lord and their neighbor, since everything the laws require consequently agreed with their perception and everything the laws prohibit conflicted with their perception.<br />They had no doubt that all human laws resembled divine laws in being founded on love for the Lord and charity for one's neighbor and in looking to love and charity as their basis.<br />Of course since they had a foundation from the Lord inside themselves, they knew everything that was built on it.<br />They believe too that all those alive in the world today who love the Lord and their neighbor also have the law written in them and are welcomed as citizens anywhere on earth, just as any such people are welcomed in the other life.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The notion of God's law being written on the heart or mind can be found in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1121/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_51_7" target=_top>Isaiah 51:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1121/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_33" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1121/bible_king-james-version_romans_2_15" target=_top>Romans 2:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1121/bible_king-james-version_hebrews_8_10" target=_top>Hebrews 8:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1121/bible_king-james-version_hebrews_10_16" target=_top>10:16</a>.

I have been informed by sons of the Most Ancient Church concerning the state of their perception, that they had perception of all things that belong to faith, almost as have the angels with whom they 
had communication; for the reason that their interior man, or spirit, by means also of the internal respiration, was joined to heaven; and that love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor are attended 
with this; for man is thus conjoined with angels through their veriest life, which consists in such love. They said that they had the law written upon them, because they were in love to the Lord and 
love toward the neighbor; and such being the case, whatever the laws prescribe was in agreement with their perception, and whatever the laws forbid was contrary to it. Nor did they doubt that all laws, 
human as well as Divine, are founded in love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, and regard these as their fundamental. Wherefore, as they had this fundamental in them, from the Lord, they 
could not but know all things that were from it. They believe too that those who live in the world at this day, who love the Lord and the neighbor, have also the law written upon them, and are acceptable 
citizens everywhere on earth, as the same are in the other life. </p>

I have learned from members' of the Most Ancient Church about their state of perception - that they had a perception of everything that was a matter of faith, almost as the angels did with whom they 
were in communication. The reason they had it was that their interior man, which is the spirit, was joined - also by means of internal breathing - to heaven, and that love to the Lord and love towards 
the neighbour have heaven within them. Thus man is joined to the angels through their very life itself which consists in such love. They said that because they abided in love to the Lord and in love 
towards the neighbour they had the law inscribed within them. That being so whatever the laws dictated was in keeping with their perception and whatever the laws forbade was contrary to that perception. 
Nor did they doubt that all human laws, like Divine laws, are based on love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and regard these as their foundation. Since they had this foundation in them 
from the Lord they could not help knowing all that arises from it. They also believe that all people living in the world today who love the Lord and the neighbour have this law inscribed within them 
as well, and are acceptable citizens everywhere on earth just as they are in the next life.

Instructus sum ab Antiquissimae Ecclesiae filiis de statu perceptionis illorum, quod nempe perceptionem habuerint omnium quae sunt fidei, paene sicut angeli cum quibus communicationem habuerunt, ex 
causa quod interior eorum homo, seu spiritus, etiam media respiratione interna junctus fuerit caelo, quodque amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum id secum habeat; sic enim conjungitur homo angelis per 
ipsissimam eorum vitam, quae consistit in amore tali; dicebant quod inscriptam sibi habuerint legem quia in amore in Dominum et amore erga proximum fuerunt; tunc enim cum perceptione illorum fuit quicquid 
leges dictant, et contra perceptionem quicquid leges vetant:  nec dubitabant quin omnes leges humanae, sicut Divinae, fundentur in amore in Dominum et charitate erga proximum, et spectent illud 
ut fundamentale suum:  quare quia fundamentale in se a Domino habuerunt, non potuerunt aliter ac nosse omnia quae inde:  credentes etiam quod omnes qui in mundo hodie vivunt qui Dominum amant et proximum, 
etiam habeant legem sibi inscriptam, et accepti cives sint ubivis in terra, sicut sunt iidem in altera vita. </p>
