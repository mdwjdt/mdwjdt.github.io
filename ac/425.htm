<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>425.</strong>迄今为止，世人尚不知道“铜”表属世良善，也不知道圣言中提到的每种金属都有特定的内在含义：如“金”表属天良善，“银”表属灵真理，“铜”表属世良善，“铁”表属世真理；其它金属，以及“木”、“石”等等也是如此。约柜、会幕和圣殿所用的“金”、“银”、“铜”、“木”等材料就表示这类事物，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。从先知书明显可知，这就是它们的含义，如以赛亚书：<br />你也必吃万国的奶，又吮列王的乳。我要拿金代替铜，拿银代替铁，拿铜代替木，拿铁代替石；并要以和平为你的官长，以公义为你的监督。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.16.htm">60:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.17.htm">17</a>）<br />这是指主的降世，祂的国度，属天教会。“金代替铜”表属天之善代替属世之善；“银代替铁”表示属灵真理代替属世真理；“铜代替木”表属世之善代替肉体之善；“铁代替石”表属世真理代替感官真理。以西结书：<br />雅完人、土巴人、米设人都与你交易；他们用人口和铜器兑换你的货物。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.13.htm">27:13</a>）<br />这指的是推罗，推罗表拥有属灵和属天财富者。“铜器”表属世良善。在摩西五经：<br />“那地的石头是铁，山内可以挖铜。”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.9.htm">8:9</a>）<br />同样，这里的“石头”表感官真理；“铁”表属世或理性真理；“铜”表属世良善。再如以西结所见四活物或基路伯的例子，它们的腿都是灿烂如光明的铜（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.7.htm">1:7</a>）此处，“铜”仍表属世良善，因为人的“脚”表属世之物。但以理也看见类似事物：<br />有一人身穿细麻衣，腰束乌法精金带。身体如水苍玉，手和脚如光明的铜。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.5.htm">10:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.6.htm">6</a>）<br />事实上，民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">21:9</a>）中提到的“铜蛇”表主的感官和属世的良善，对此，可查看197节。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]425.</strong> The world is still unaware that bronze symbolizes earthly good, and that every metal named in the Word is a symbol for something in the inner meaning. Gold, for instance, symbolizes heavenly good, silver symbolizes spiritual truth, bronze earthly good, iron earthly truth, and so on with all the rest. The same is true for stone and wood. The gold, silver, bronze, and wood used in the ark and in the tabernacle symbolize these things, as do those used in the Temple, all of which will be taken up later, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} These symbolic meanings shine out in the prophets. In Isaiah, for example:<br />You will suck the milk of the nations, and you will suck the nipple of monarchs. For bronze I will bring in gold; and for iron I will bring in silver; and for wood, bronze; and for stones, iron; and I will make peace your property, and justice your taskmaster. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_16-17" target=_top>Isaiah 60:16-17</a>)<br />This is about the Lord's Coming, his kingdom, and the church whose character is heavenly. "For bronze, gold" means heavenly goodness in place of earthly goodness. "For iron, silver" means spiritual truth in place of earthly truth. "For wood, bronze" means goodness on the earthly level in place of goodness on the bodily level. "For stones, iron" means truth on the earthly level in place of truth gained through the senses.{*2} In Ezekiel:<br />Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your dealers in human souls; and vessels of bronze they sold as your trade goods. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_13" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:13</a>)<br />The subject here is Tyre, which symbolizes those who have spiritual and heavenly riches; the vessels of bronze stand for earthly goodness. In Moses:<br />... a land whose stones are iron, and from its mountains you will mine bronze. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_8_9" target=_top>Deuteronomy 8:9</a>)<br />Here too the stones stand for truth gained through the senses, iron stands for truth on the earthly plane, or truth in the rational mind, and bronze stands for good on the earthly plane. Ezekiel saw four living creatures (guardian beings) with feet gleaming "like the appearance of burnished bronze" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_7" target=_top>Ezekiel 1:7</a>), where again bronze symbolizes good on the earthly level, because a person's foot represents the earthly level. Daniel likewise saw:<br />A man clothed in linen, and his hips were circled with the gold of Uphaz, and his body was like tarshish,{*3} his arms and his feet were like the appearance of burnished bronze. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/bible_king-james-version_daniel_10_5-6" target=_top>Daniel 10:5-6</a>)<br />The bronze snake mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_9" target=_top>Numbers 21:9</a> represented goodness present in the Lord on the level of the senses and on the earthly plane. See the earlier discussion [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_197" target=_top>197</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the sacred and symbolic use of these materials, see the explanations of Exodus 25-30 in volumes 14, 15. [LHC]<br />{*2} In Swedenborg's theology, the earthly level is the mind's lowest level and is closely connected with the physical world but remains a step above the body and its senses. See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259" target=_top>259</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4038" target=_top>4038</a>; see also note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_425/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8" target=_top>8</a>.

It is unknown to the world at the present day that "brass" signifies natural good, and also that every metal mentioned in the Word has a specific signification in the internal sense-as "gold" celestial 
good; "silver" spiritual truth; "brass" natural good; "iron" natural truth; and so on with the other metals, and in like manner "wood" and "stone." Such things were signified by the "gold" "silver" 
"brass" and "wood" used in the ark and in the tabernacle and in the temple, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. That such is their signification is manifest from the Prophets, as 
from Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings. For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones 
iron; I will also make thy tribute peace, and thine exactors righteousness (Isa. 60:16-17), treating of the Lord's advent, of His kingdom, and of the celestial church. "For brass gold" signifies for 
natural good celestial good; "for iron silver" signifies for natural truth spiritual truth; "for wood brass" signifies for corporeal good natural good; "for stones iron" signifies for sensuous truth natural 
truth. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, these were thy merchants, in the soul of man, and vessels of brass they gave thy trading (Ezek. 27:13), speaking of Tyre, by which are signified 
those who possess spiritual and celestial riches; "vessels of brass" are natural goods. In Moses: </p>
<p>     A land whose stones are iron, and out of whose mountains thou mayest hew brass (Deut. 8:9), where 
also "stones" denote sensuous truth; "iron" natural, that is, rational truth; and "brass" natural good. Ezekiel saw: </p>
<p>     Four living creatures, or cherubs, whose feet sparkled like the appearance 
of burnished brass (Ezek. 1:7), where again "brass" signifies natural good, for the "foot" of man represents what is natural. In like manner there appeared to Daniel,     A man clothed in linen, 
whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz, his body also was like the beryl, and his arms and his feet like the appearance of burnished brass (Dan. 10:5-6). That the "brazen serpent" (Num. 21:9) represented 
the sensuous and natural good of the Lord, may be seen above. </p>

Up to now the world has not known that 'bronze' means natural good, nor indeed that every metal mentioned in the Word has some definite meaning in the internal sense. For example 'gold' means celestial 
good, 'silver' spiritual truth, 'bronze' natural good, 'iron' natural truth, and so on with all the rest. The same applies to stone and wood. These were the meanings of the gold, silver, bronze, and 
wood in the Ark and the Tabernacle, and of similar objects in the Temple, which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt with later on. In the Prophets it is plain that such things are meant, as in 
Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will suck the milk of nations, and the breast of kings will you suck. Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron, I will bring silver, and instead of wood, bronze, and instead 
or stones, iron. And I will make peace your assessment and righteousness your tax-collectors. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord and to His kingdom, and to the celestial Church. 
'Gold instead of bronze' means celestial good instead of natural good. 'Silver instead of iron' means spiritual truth instead of natural truth. 'Bronze instead of wood' means natural good instead 
of bodily good. 'Iron instead of stones' means natural truth instead of sensory truth. In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants in the souls of men, and they gave vessels 
of bronze for your merchandise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:13%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:13 </a> 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means people who are in possession of spiritual and celestial riches. 'Vessels of bronze' stands for natural goods. In Moses, 
   A land whose stones are Iron, and from whose mountains you will dig out bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%208:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 8:9</a>.  </p>
<p>Here similarly 'stones' stands for sensory truth, 'iron' for natural or rational truth, and 'bronze' 
for natural good. In the cases of the four living creatures or the cherubim seen by Ezekiel, whose feet sparkled like burnished bronze, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:7</a>, 'bronze' in a similar way means natural good, for the 
human foot represents that which is natural. Something similar was seen by Daniel,  </p>
<p>A man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz and whose body was like tarshish.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> His arms 
and feet were like the appearance of burnished bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2010:5,%206%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 10:5, 6 </a> </p>
<blockquote>
And for the fact that the bronze serpent mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:9</a>

Quod 'aes' significet bonum naturale, adhuc orbi ignotum est; tum quod unumquodvis metallum quod nominatur in Verbo, significet quoddam in sensu interno; ut 'aurum' bonum caeleste; 'argentum' verum 
spirituale; 'aes' bonum naturale; 'ferrum' verum naturale, et sic porro reliqua; similiter lapis et lignum; talia significata sunt per aurum, argentum, aes, lignum, in arca et tabernaculo; similia in 
templo, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: apud Prophetas elucet quod talia significentur; ut apud Esaiam, 	Suges lac gentium, et uber regum suges,... pro aere adducam aurum; 
et pro ferro adducam argentum; et pro lignis aes, et pro lapidibus ferrum; ponamque censum tuum pacem, et exactores tuos justitiam, lx 16, 17; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini et Ipsius regno, et Ecclesia caelesti 
agitur; pro aere aurum; significat pro bono naturali bonum caeleste; 'pro ferro argentum' pro vero naturali verum spirituale; 'pro lignis aes' significat pro corporeo bono naturale bonum; 'pro lapidibus

agitur de Tyro, per quem significantur qui possident divitias spirituales et caelestes, ubi 'vasa aeris' pro bonis naturalibus: apud Mosen, 	Terra, ejus lapides ferrum, et ex montibus ejus excides
