<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3197.</strong>“傍晚时分”表相对于在它之下的那些事物。这从“傍晚”的含义清楚可知，“傍晚”是指模糊（参看<a href="3056.htm">3056</a>节）。在人里面，那些在下的事物，也就是属于其属世心智的事物，相对于那些在上，也就是在理性心智中的事物而言，是模糊的，故“傍晚”表示相对模糊的事物。这从内义上的整个思路明显看出来，因为此处所论述的主题是来自属世人的真理，这真理要与理性中的良善联结。而此处所论述的就是这种联结，以及由理性而来的属世人的启示，故“在田间默想”表示相对于那些在下的事物而言，沉浸于良善的理性的状态。沉浸于良善的状态被描述为“住在南地”，即在神性之光中。与此相比，以前，也就是真理与良善联结，以及属世层也变成神性之前，理性之下的事物处于傍晚的阴影。</p>

Toward evening. That this signifies in respect to those things which are beneath, is evident from the signification of "evening," as being what is obscure (see n. 3056); and whereas those things with 
man which are beneath, namely, those which are of the natural mind, relatively to those which are above, that is, in the rational mind, are obscure, therefore by "evening" is signified what is relatively 
in obscurity, as is evident from the series of things in the internal sense; for the subject here treated of is truth from the natural, which was to be conjoined with good in the rational; and whereas 
this conjunction is here treated of, and the enlightenment of the natural man thereby, therefore by "meditating in the field toward evening," is signified the state of the rational in good relatively 
to those things which are beneath; the state in good being described by "dwelling in the land of the south," that is, in Divine light, relatively to which the things beneath were in the "evening," 
that is, before the conjunction of truth and good was effected, and before the natural also was made Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3197</b></p><p><b>3197.</b>
'Towards evening' means as compared with the things below it. This is clear from the meaning of 'evening' as obscurity, dealt with in <a href="3056.htm">3056</a>. And since the things of a lower nature in a person, namely 
those belonging to his natural mind, are in obscurity as compared with the things of a higher nature, namely those belonging to his rational mind, 'evening' therefore means those things which, compared 
with them in other states, are in obscurity, as may be seen from the train of thought in the internal sense. For the subject in the internal sense is truth from the natural that was to be joined to 
good in the rational. And since the subject at this point is the joining together of these two, and the enlightenment of the natural man through the rational, 'meditating in the field towards evening' 
therefore means a state of the rational that is immersed in good as compared with the things below it. The state of immersion in good is described by Isaac's dwelling 'in the land of the south', that 
is, dwelling in Divine light. Compared with this the things below the Rational dwelt in evening shade, before, that is, truth and good had been joined together and before the Natural too had been made Divine. </p>

</p><b>3197.</b>
`Versus vesperam':  quod significet respective ad illa quae infra, constat a significatione `vesperae' quod sit obscuram, de qua n. 3056, et quia illa quae infra sunt apud hominem, nempe illa quae sunt 
mentis naturalis, sunt obscura respective ad illa quae supra sunt, nempe illa quae sunt mentis rationalis, ideo per `vesperam' significantur illa quae in obscuro respective, ut constare potest a serie 
rerum in sensu interno; agitur enim de vero e naturali, quod conjungendum bono in rationali; et quia hic agitur de conjunctione, et de illustratione naturalis hominis per illud, ideo per `meditari 
in agro versus vesperam' significatur status rationalis in bono respective ad a quae infra; status in bono describitur per quod `habitaret in terra meridiei,' hoc est, in Divina luce, ad quam respective 
illa quae infra, erant in vespera, nempe antequam conjunctio facta veri et boni, et antequam Naturale quoque Divinum factum. </p>
