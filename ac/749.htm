<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>749.</strong>“有公有母”表真理与良善。这一点从前面所述（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.2.htm">7:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.3.htm">3</a>）清楚可知，那里“一公一母”与飞鸟相关，而“男人与妻子”则与牲畜相关，然后还阐明了原因，即，意愿之物会与觉知之物结婚，而觉知之物就本身而言，却未能与意愿之物结婚。前者作为“男人与妻子”存在，而后者作为“一公一母”存在。由于此处的主题首先是涉及那人觉知之物的试探，如前所述，故用了“一公一母”这个词，并且是指涉及觉知之物的争战或试探。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]749.</strong> The symbolism of a male and a female as truth and goodness can be seen from what appeared previously at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_19" target=_top>Genesis 6:19</a>, where male and female are used of birds, but man and wife are used of the animals.{*1} The reason also appeared there; the contents of the will marry the contents of the intellect but the contents of the intellect (regarded in themselves) do not really marry those of the will. The former relationship is like that of husband and wife but the latter like that of male and female. And since the present chapter takes up first the challenge to the ideas in their intellect that the people under discussion faced, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_734" target=_top>734</a>], the phrase used is a male and a female. It implies combat, or a challenge to one's intellectual concerns.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This seems to be a slight misstatement. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_19" target=_top>Genesis 6:19</a> does refer to "every living thing" as being male and female, and the meaning of "male" and "female" is given in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_672" target=_top>672</a>. But it is in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_2-3" target=_top>Genesis 7:2-3</a> that the expression "man and wife" is applied to animals and "male and female" to birds, and the explanation of this distinction appears in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_725" target=_top>725</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 749</b></p><p><b>749.</b>
That "male and female" signify truth and good, may be seen from what has been said before, at verses 2 and 3 of this chapter, where "male and female" are predicated of fowls, and "man and wife" of beasts. 
The reason was also then stated, namely, that there is a marriage of the things of the will with those of the understanding, and not so much of the things of the understanding, in themselves regarded, 
with those of the will. The former are related as man and wife, the latter as male and female. And because the subject here, as before said, is the temptation of that man as to the things of his 
understanding, it is said "male and female" and there is meant a combat or temptation as to the things of the understanding. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 749</b></p><p><b>749.</b>
'Male and female' means truth and good. This is clear from what has been stated already at Chapter 6:19 where 'male and female' have reference to birds, but 'male and mate'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to beasts. The reason is 
also stated there, namely, that things of the will are married to those of the understanding, but less so those of the understanding regarded in themselves to those of the will. The former exist as male 
and mate<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> but the latter as male and female. Now because here the subject first of all is the temptation of that man as regards things of the understanding, as has been stated, the phrase 'male and 
female' is used, and conflict, or temptation as regards things of the understanding, is meant.

</p><b>749.</b>
Quod 'masculus et femina' significent verum et bonum, constat ab illis quae prius cap. vi vers. 19; ubi 'masculus et femina' praedicatur de avibus, sed 'vir et uxor' de bestiis; causa quoque ibi dicta 
est, quod nempe voluntariorum cum intellectualibus sit conjugium, non ita intellectualium in se spectatorum cum voluntariis; illa se habent ut vir et uxor, haec vero ut masculus et femina: et quia 
hic primum agitur de tentatione istius hominis quoad intellectualia, ut dictum, dicitur masculus et femina; et intelligitur pugna, seu tentatio quoad intellectualia. </p>
