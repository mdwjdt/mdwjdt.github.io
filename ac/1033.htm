<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1033.</strong>至于照其宗教信仰被赋予外邦人的对正确与良善的良知，情况是这样：良知一般要么是真的，要么是假的。真良知是由主通过信之真理所形成的良知。一旦被赋予这良知，人就会害怕违背信之真理行事，因为这样做就是违背良知行事。若非拥有信之真理，没人能接受这良知，因此在基督教界，接受它的人并没有那么多，因为人人都将自己的教条当作信之真理。尽管如此，那些正经历重生之人会在接受仁爱期间接受良知，因为良知的基本构成是仁爱。<br />假良知则是通过外邦人在其中出生并长大的宗教敬拜而在他们身上形成的一种良知。对他们来说，违背其宗教敬拜行事就是违背良知行事。若其良知基于仁爱、怜悯和顺从，他们就处于能在来生接受真良知这样的状态，并确实会接受它。事实上，除了信之真理外，他们宁愿什么也不要。<br />假良知不是通过内在事物形成的，而是通过外在事物形成的，也就是说，不是通过仁爱形成的，而是通过我欲和物欲形成的。有些人在损害邻舍时，自己会觉得是违背良知行事，并且在这种时候，其内心还会感到痛苦。然而，这是因为他们在思想时意识到自己的生命、地位、名誉、财富或经济利益处于危机之中，因而意识到自己正在受到损害。有些人经遗传获得这种软心肠，有些人则是自己获得的。不过，这是一种假良知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1033.</strong> Non-Christians also receive the gift of a conscience for what is right and good, according to their religious tradition, as noted. This is how it stands:<br />The general kinds of conscience are true conscience, spurious conscience, and false conscience.<br />A true conscience is one that the Lord forms out of genuine religious truth. When we have been gifted with this conscience, we are afraid to go against the truth that the faith teaches, because to do so is to violate conscience. No one can receive this kind of conscience but those who are imbued with the truths of the faith. For this reason not many in Christendom do, since everyone sets up her or his own theology as religious truth. Still, those who are reborn receive a conscience, and charity along with it, since charity is the foundation of conscience.<br />[2] A spurious conscience is one formed in non-Christians out of the tradition they were born into and brought up in. For them, acting contrary to this is acting contrary to conscience. When their conscience is founded on charity and mercy, and on obedience, they are the kind of people who can and do receive true conscience in the other life, since there is nothing they love better or more fervently than the truth that the faith teaches.<br />[3] A false conscience is one formed not from internal but from external considerations, that is, not from charity but from selfishness and materialism. People with this kind of conscience see themselves as violating conscience when they offend their neighbor and also imagine that they feel an inward torment then. But the reason for their qualms is that in their mind's eye they see their offense as endangering their own life, position, reputation, wealth, or income, and as doing harm to themselves. Some acquire a certain softness of heart by heredity, some by effort; but it is false conscience. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1033</b></p><p><b>1033.</b>
With regard to a conscience of what is right and good being given to Gentiles according to their religion, the case is this, Conscience, in general, is either true, spurious, or false.  True conscience 
is that which is formed by the Lord of the truths of faith. When a man has been gifted with this, he fears to act contrary to the truths of faith, because he would thus act contrary to conscience. 
This conscience no one can receive who is not in the truths of faith, and therefore there are not very many in the Christian world who receive it, for each one sets up his own dogma as the truth of faith. 
But still those who are being regenerated receive conscience together with charity, for the very ground of conscience is charity. Spurious conscience is that which is formed with Gentiles from their 
religious worship into which they have been born and educated, to act contrary to which is to them to act contrary to conscience. When their conscience has been founded in charity and mercy, and in 
obedience, they are in such a state that they can receive true conscience in the other life, and they also do receive it; for they love nothing before and beyond the truth of faith. False conscience 
is that which is formed, not from internal but from external things, that is, not from charity but from the love of self and of the world. For there are those who seem to themselves to act contrary to 
conscience when they act against the neighbor, and also seem to themselves to be then inwardly pained; and yet it is for the reason that they perceive in their thought that their life, honor, fame, 
wealth, or gain, is thus imperiled, and therefore they themselves are injured. Some inherit such a softness of heart, some acquire it; but it is a false conscience. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1033</b></p><p><b>1033.</b>
With regard to the assertion that gentiles too have a conscience for what is right and good conferred on them according to the religion they have, the situation is this: Conscience in general is either 
true, spurious, or false. True conscience is a conscience formed by the Lord from truths of faith. Once it has been conferred a person is afraid to act contrary to the truths of faith because to do 
so is to act contrary to conscience. This conscience nobody can receive who does not possess any truths of faith, and this also is why not so many in the Christian world do so, for there everybody advances 
his own dogma as being the truth of faith. Nevertheless people who are being regenerated receive conscience while receiving charity, for the basic constituent of conscience is charity.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
Spurious conscience is a conscience formed with gentiles from the religious worship in which they have been born and brought up. For them acting contrary to that religious worship is acting contrary to 
conscience. When their conscience is grounded in charity and mercy, and in obedience, they are people such as are able to receive a true conscience in the next life, and do indeed receive it. In fact 
there is nothing they would rather have than the truth of faith.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 False conscience is a conscience formed not from internal things but from external, that is, not from charity but from self-love 
and love of the world. In fact there are people who seem to themselves to be acting contrary to conscience when they act against their neighbour, and who also at such times seem to themselves to be 
inwardly smitten. Yet the reason is that they perceive in their thought that their own life, position, reputation, wealth, or financial gain is at stake, and so perceive that they themselves are being 
hurt. Some inherit this soft-heartedness, others acquire it for themselves. It is however a false conscience. </p>

</p><b>1033.</b>
Dictum quod gentes quoque conscientia recti et boni secundum religiosum eorum donentur, quod ita se habet: conscientia in genere est vera, spuria, et falsa; conscientia vera est quae formatur a Domino 
ex veris fidei, qua cum donatus est homo, timet agere contra vera fidei quia sic contra conscientiam; hanc conscientiam nemo accipere potest qui non in veris fidei est, quare etiam non ita multi in 
orbe Christiano, quisque enim verum fidei statuit suum dogma; sed usque qui regenerantur, accipiunt conscientiam cum charitatem, nam fundamentale conscientiae est charitas.  [2] Conscientia spuria est 
quae formatur apud gentes ex cultu eorum religioso in quem nati et educati sunt, contra quem agere iis est contra conscientiam; quorum conscientia cum fundata est in charitate, et misericordia, et in 
oboedientia, tunc tales sunt, ut veram conscientiam in altera vita recipere possint, quam etiam accipiunt; nihil enim prius et potius amant quam verum fidei. [3] Conscientia falsa est quae formatur 
non ab internis sed ab externis, hoc est, non a charitate, sed ab amore sui et mundi; sunt enim qui sibi videntur contra conscientiam agere cum contra proximum, et quoque tunc videntur sibi intrinsecus 
angi; sed est ex causa quia sic cogitatione percipiunt suam vitam, suum honorem, suam famam, suas opes, aut suum lucrum, periclitari, et sic ipsum se laedi; aliqui ex hereditario trahunt quandam talem 
mollitiem cordis, quidam sibi acquirunt, sed est conscientia falsa. </p>
