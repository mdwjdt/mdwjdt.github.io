<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2722节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2722.</strong>“亚伯拉罕在别是巴种植果园”表教义及其认知和性质。这从“果园”和“别是巴”的含义清楚可知。关于果园：古教会在山上和果园里举行神圣的敬拜。之所以在山上，是因为山表敬拜的属天之物；之所以在果园里，是因为果园表敬拜的属灵之物。只要该教会，即古教会保持这份质朴，那时他们在山上和果园里的敬拜就是神圣的。原因在于，属天之物，就是爱与仁的事物，由巍峨高耸的事物来代表，如大山小山；而源于属天之物的属灵之物，则由硕果累累、枝繁叶茂的事物来代表，如花园、果园。不过，后来，这些有代表性和象征性的符号由于人们敬拜没有内在的外在事物而变成偶像崇拜，以致神圣敬拜遭到亵渎；因此他们被禁止在山上和果园里敬拜。<br />古人在山上举行敬拜的事实从创世记12章有关亚伯兰的论述清楚看出来：<br />从那里他又迁到伯特利东边的山，支搭帐棚。西边是伯特利，东边是艾。他在那里又筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.8.htm">12:8</a>，<w1>1449<w2>1449<w3>-<w1>1455<w2>1455<w3>节）<br />这从“山”的含义也清楚可知：“山”是指爱的属天实体（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。人们也在果园里敬拜的事实从本节经文，以及“果园”和“树”的含义清楚可知：本节经上说“亚伯拉罕在别是巴种植果园，又在那里求告（耶和华）永生神的名”；“果园”是指聪明（<a href="100.htm">100</a>，<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="1588.htm">1588</a>节）；“树”是指直觉（<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>节）。在山上和果园里的敬拜被禁止的事实从以下摩西书的经文明显看出来：<br />你不可在耶和华你神的坛旁栽什么树的木偶（grove），也不可为自己设立柱像，这是耶和华你神所恨恶的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.21.htm">16:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.22.htm">22</a>）<br />出埃及记：<br />你要拆毁那些民族的祭坛，打碎他们的柱像，砍下他们的木偶（grove）。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.13.htm">34:13</a>）<br />他们还被命令：<br />用火焚烧他们的木偶（grove）。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.3.htm">12:3</a>）<br />古教会的代表性仪式设立在犹太人和以色列人当中，他们唯独沉浸在外在事物中，内心无非是偶像崇拜者，是那种既不承认也不想承认任何内在事物或死后生命的人，不知道弥赛亚的国度是天国。因此，当有自由的时候，他们就在大山小山、果园森林举行亵渎的敬拜。他们还为自己制造丘坛以取代大山小山，雕刻偶像以取代果园。这从圣言中的很多经文明显看出来，如士师记：<br />以色列人去事奉诸巴力和木偶。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士3.7.htm">3:7</a>）<br />列王纪：<br />以色列人做木偶，惹耶和华发怒。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上14.15.htm">14:15</a>）<br /><br />犹大人在各高冈上，各青翠树下筑了邱坛，立了柱像和木偶。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上14.23.htm">14:23</a>）<br /><br />以色列人在他们所有的城邑建筑邱坛，在各高冈上、各青翠树下立柱像和木偶。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.9.htm">17:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />犹大王玛拿西为巴力筑坛，做木偶，效法以色列王亚哈所行的，又在神的殿内立雕刻的偶像。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下21.3.htm">21:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下21.7.htm">7</a>）<br />由此明显可知，他们也为自己雕刻偶像。约西亚王摧毁了这些偶像的事实在列王纪中也有所提及：<br />约西亚将那为巴力和亚舍拉（the grove）、日、月并天上万象所造的器皿，都从耶和华殿里搬出来，在耶路撒冷外烧了，又拆毁妇女为亚舍拉（the grove）织帐子的屋子。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.4.htm">23:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.15.htm">15</a>）<br />他还砍下所罗门制造的木偶（the grove），同样在伯特利砍下耶罗波安制造的亚舍拉（the grove）（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.4.htm">23:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.15.htm">15</a>）。<br />希西家王也拆毁这类事物，这一事实可见于列王纪：<br />犹大的希西家王废去邱坛，毁坏柱像，砍下木偶，打碎摩西所造的铜蛇。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下18.4.htm">18:4</a>）<br />显然，铜蛇在摩西那个时代是神圣的。但是，当所敬拜的是外在事物时，铜蛇就遭到亵渎，因此被打碎。由于同样的原因，在山上和果园里的敬拜被禁止。这些事在先知书中看得更清楚。以赛亚书：<br />你们在各青翠树下因神明欲火攻心；在岩石峭壁下的溪谷间献上孩子为牲祭。你也向溪谷浇了奠祭、献了供物；你在巍峨高耸的山上安设居所，也上那里去献祭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.5.htm">57:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.7.htm">7</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />当那日，人必仰望造他的主，眼目重看以色列的圣者；他必不仰望祭坛，就是自己手所筑的，也不重看自己指头所做的，无论是木偶（groves）是日像（sun images）。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />我必从你中间除灭雕刻的偶像和柱像，你就不再跪拜自己手所造的。我必从你中间拔出木偶，又毁灭你的城邑。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.13.htm">5:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.14.htm">14</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />他们被杀的人倒在他们偶像的中间，在他们祭坛的周围，就是在各高冈各山顶上，在每一棵翠绿的树下和茂盛的橡树下，就是他们献馨香的祭给一切偶像的地方。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.13.htm">6:13</a>）<br />由此明显可知偶像崇拜的来源，也就是说，它源于对具有代表性和灵义的物体本身的敬拜。生活在大洪水之前的上古之人在每一个事物，如大山小山、平原、山谷、花园、果园、森林、江河水流、田野谷物、各种树木和活物，以及发光的天体中所看到的是代表和象征主国度的事物。但他们的目光从不停留在这些物体上，更不用他们的心思了。这些事物只不过是有助于他们思想主国度中的属天和属灵之物的工具罢了；并且这种情形甚至到了这种程度，即整个自然界中根本没有一物不作为这类工具而服务于他们。真相是：自然万物都具有代表性，但如今这是一个奥秘，几乎无人相信。本为对主之爱的属天之物消失后，人类就不再处于这种状态，即能透过世俗物体看到主国度的属天和属灵之物的状态。<br />然而，洪水后的古人通过传统习俗和一些人所作的收集知道，这些物体具有这样的含义。由于它们具有这样的含义，他们也视其为圣。古教会的代表性敬拜由此产生，该教会因是属灵的，故不享有“事情就是如此”的任何直觉，只知道事实。因为与上古教会相比，古教会居于模糊中（<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。然而，他们并不敬拜外在事物，而是藉着外在事物回想内在事物。所以，当转向这些代表性和象征性的符号时，他们便处于敬拜的圣洁中。他们能转向这些符号，是因为他们具有属灵之爱，即仁爱，他们使仁爱成为敬拜的本质，主的圣洁因此能流入他们的敬拜中。但是，当人类状态发生改变并败坏，以致人们背离仁之善，从而不再相信天国或死后生命的存在，反而以为（如当今之人所以为的那样），人类的状况与动物无异，只不过他们作为人类能够说话的时候，神圣的代表性敬拜就转为偶像崇拜了，所敬拜的也只是外在事物。这就是为何在那时的外邦人，甚至犹太人和以色列人当中，敬拜不再具有代表性，而是一种代表性和象征性符号的敬拜，也就是没有内在的外在事物的敬拜。<br />关于具体的“果园”：在古人当中，它们具有各种含义，事实上，这类含义取决于果园里的树木种类。有橄榄树的果园表示敬拜的属天之物；有葡萄树的果园表示敬拜的属灵之物；而有无花果树、香柏树、杉树、杨树和橡树的果园则表示与属天和属灵之物有关的各种事物。然而，此处仅仅提到“果园”或栽植树木，这表示属于与教义联结的理性的事物及其认知，因为树一般表直觉（<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>节）。不过，它们论及属灵教会时，表示认知。原因在于，除了通过取自教义或圣言的认知所获得的直觉外，属灵教会成员没有任何其它直觉。因为这类认知成为其信仰的一部分，从而成为其良善的一部分，他通过这良知拥有直觉。</p>

He planted a grove in Beersheba. That this signifies doctrine thence with its knowledges and its quality, is evident from the signification of a "grove," and from the signification of "Beersheba." As 
regards groves: in the Ancient Church holy worship was performed on mountains and in groves; on mountains, because mountains signified the celestial things of worship; and in groves, because groves signified 
its spiritual things. So long as that church, namely, the Ancient, was in its simplicity, their worship at that time on mountains and in groves was holy, for the reason that celestial things, 
which are those of love and charity, were represented by things high and lofty, such as mountains and hills; and spiritual things, which are therefrom, by things fruitful and leafy, such as gardens and 
groves; but after representatives and significatives began to be made idolatrous, by the worship of external things without internal, that holy worship became profane; and they were therefore forbidden 
to worship on mountains and in groves. [2] That the ancients held holy worship on mountains is evident from the twelfth chapter of Genesis, where we read of Abraham: </p>
<p>     He removed thence unto 
a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the sea, and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar, and called on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 12:8, n. 1449-1455); </p>
<p>and also 
from the signification of a "mountain," as being the celestial of love (n. 795, 796, 1430). That they also held holy worship in groves is evident from what is stated in this verse: "Abraham planted 
a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the God of eternity;" and also from the signification of a "garden," as being intelligence (n. 100, 108, 1588); and of "trees," as being perceptions 
(n. 103, 2163). That this was forbidden is evident from the following passages. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any tree beside the altar of Jehovah thy God which thou shalt make 
thee, and thou shalt not set thee up a pillar; which Jehovah thy God hateth (Deut. 16:21-22). In the same: </p>
<p>     The altars of the nations shall ye break down, and dash in pieces their pillars, and 
cut down their groves (Exod. 34:13); </p>
<p>and they were commanded to burn the groves of the nations with fire (Deut. 12:3). [3] And as the Jews and Israelites, among whom the representative ritual of 
the Ancient Church was introduced, were solely in externals, and at heart were nothing but idolaters, neither knowing nor wishing to know what anything internal was, nor the life after death, nor even 
that the Messiah's kingdom was a heavenly one, therefore whenever they were in freedom they held profane worship on mountains and hills, and also in groves and forests; and likewise in place of mountains 
and hills they made for themselves high places, and in place of groves carved representations of a grove, as is evident from many passages in the Word. As in the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     The sons of 
Israel served Baalim and the groves (Judg. 3:7). In the book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Israel made groves provoking Jehovah (1 Kings 14:15). And in another place: </p>
<p>     Judah built them high places, and pillars, 
and groves, upon every high hill, and under every green tree (1 Kings 14:23). And again: </p>
<p>     Israel built them high places in all their cities, and set up pillars and groves upon every high hill, 
and under every green tree (2 Kings 17:9-10). And again: </p>
<p>     Manasseh king of Judah reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel, and set the carved image of the grove 
which he had made in the house of God (2 Kings 21:3, 7); </p>
<p>from which it is manifest that they also made for themselves carved images of a grove. That these were destroyed by king Josiah may be seen 
in the same book: </p>
<p>     Josiah caused all the vessels that were made for Baal and for the grove, and for the sun and the moon, and for all the army of the heavens, to be brought out of the temple of Jehovah, 
and he burnt them without Jerusalem, and the houses which the women had woven there for the grove (2 Kings 23:4-5, 7, 14-15). He also cut down the groves which Solomon had made, and likewise 
the grove in Bethel which Jeroboam had made (2 Kings 23:4, 6-7, 13-15). That king Hezekiah also demolished such things may be seen in the same book: </p>
<p>     Hezekiah king of Judah removed the high places, 
and brake the pillars, and cut down the grove, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent which Moses had made (2 Kings 18:4). [4] That the brazen serpent was holy in the time of Moses is evident; but 
when the external was worshiped it became profane, and was broken in pieces, for the same reason that worship on mountains and in groves was forbidden. These things are still more evident in the Prophets. 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Inflaming yourselves with gods under every green tree; sacrificing the children in the rivers under the crags of the rocks; thou hast also poured out a drink-offering to the rivers, 
thou hast offered a gift; upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy habitation, and thither wentest thou up* to offer sacrifice (Isa. 57:5-7). In the same: </p>
<p>     In that day shall a man look 
unto his Maker, and his eyes shall see the Holy One of Israel; and he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands, neither shall he see that which his fingers have made, and the groves and 
the sun images (Isa. 17:7-8). In Micah: </p>
<p>     I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more bow thyself down to the work of thy hands; and I will pluck 
up thy groves out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy cities (Micah 5:13-14). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     That their slain may be among their idols, round about their altars, upon every high hill, 
on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every tangled oak, the place where they did offer an odor of rest to all their idols (Ezek. 6:13). [5] From all this it is now 
manifest from what origin idolatrous worship came, namely, the worship of objects that were representative and significative. The most ancient people who were before the flood saw in each and everything-in 
mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, gardens, groves, and forests, rivers and waters, fields and plantations, trees and animals of every kind, and the luminaries of heaven-something representative 
and significative of the Lord's kingdom; but they never dwelt with their eyes, still less with their minds, on these objects; but these things served them as means for thinking about the celestial 
and spiritual things in the Lord's kingdom; and this to such a degree that there was nothing at all in universal nature that did not serve them as such means. The real fact is that everything in nature 
is representative, which is an arcanum at this day and scarcely believed by anyone. But after the celestial which is of love to the Lord had perished, the human race was then no longer in that state-namely, 
that from objects as means they could see the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom. [6] Yet the ancients after the flood knew, from traditions, and from collections made 
by certain persons, that these things had such a signification; and as they were significative they esteemed them holy. Hence came the representative worship of the Ancient Church; which church, being 
spiritual, was not in the perception that a thing was so, but was in the knowledge of the fact; for it was relatively in obscurity (n. 2715). Nevertheless they did not worship outward things, but by 
means of outward things they called to mind inward things; and hence when they were in those representatives and significatives, they were in holiness of worship. They were able to be so because they 
were in spiritual love, that is, in charity, which they made an essential of worship; and therefore holiness from the Lord could flow into their worship. But when the state of the human race had become 
so changed and perverted that they removed themselves from the good of charity, and thus no longer believed that there was any heavenly kingdom, or any life after death, but that men were in a similar 
condition with animals, save only that they could think (as is also believed at this day), then the holy representative worship was turned into idolatry, and the outward things were worshiped. Hence 
with many Gentiles at that time, and also with the Jews and Israelites, the worship was not representative, but was a worship of the representatives and significatives; that is, of the outward things 
without the inward. [7] As regards groves in particular, among the ancients they were of various signification, and indeed according to the kinds of trees in them. Groves of olive-trees signified the 
celestial things of worship; groves of vines signified the spiritual things of worship; but groves of fig-trees, cedars, fir-trees, poplars, and oaks, signified various things relating to what is celestial 
and spiritual. In the passage before us mention is made simply of a grove or plantation of trees; and this signifies the things of reason that were adjoined to doctrine and its knowledges; for 
trees in general signify perceptions (n. 103, 2163), but when they are predicated of the spiritual church they signify knowledges, for the reason that the man of the spiritual church has no other perceptions 
than those which come through knowledges from doctrine or the Word; for these become of his faith, and thus of conscience, from which he has perception. * Ibi obtulisti, but eo ascendisti, 
Apocalypse Explained 405. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2722</b></p><p><b>2722.</b>
That 'he planted a grove in Beersheba' means doctrine from this with the cognitions composing it and the nature of it is clear from the meaning of 'a grove' and from the meaning of 'Beersheba'. As regards 
'groves', holy worship in the Ancient Church was offered on mountains and in groves. It was offered on mountains because 'mountains meant the celestial things of worship, and in groves because 'groves' 
meant the spiritual things of it. As long as that Church - the Ancient Church - retained its simplicity their worship on mountains and in groves was holy, the reason being that celestial things, 
which are those of love and charity, were represented by places that were high and lofty, such as mountains and hills, while spiritual things, which derive from celestial, were represented by places 
with fruits and foliage such as gardens and groves. But after representatives and meaningful signs began to be made idolatrous because people worshipped external things without internal, that holy worship 
became profane; and they were therefore forbidden to hold worship on mountains and in groves. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the Ancients held holy worship on mountains becomes clear from what is said about 
Abram in Chapter <a href="12.htm">12</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
He removed from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, Bethel being towards the sea and Ai towards the east.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And there he built an altar and called 
on the name of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2012:%208%20(1449-1455)&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 12: 8 (1449-1455)</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is also clear from the meaning of 'a mountain' as the celestial entity of love, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>,<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. The fact that people also held worship in groves 
is clear from what is said in the present verse, 'Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of [Jehovah,] the God of Eternity', and also from the meaning of 'a garden' as 
intelligence, <a href="100.htm">100</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>,<a href="1588.htm">1588</a>, and of 'trees' as perceptions, <a href="103.htm">103</a>, <a href="2163.htm">2163</a>. The fact that worship on mountains and in groves was forbidden is clear from the following: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall not plant for 
yourself a grove of any kind of tree beside the altar of Jehovah your God which you shall make for yourself. And you shall not erect for yourself a pillar, which Jehovah your God hates. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:%2021,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16: 21, 22</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
The altars of the nations you shall destroy; you shall break down their pillars and cut down their groves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34: 13</a>.

<blockquote>
They were also commanded to burn the groves of

 Now because the Jews and Israelites, among whom the representative ritual observances of the Ancient Church were introduced, were steeped solely in external 
things and were at heart nothing but idolaters, and because they were people who neither had nor wished to have knowledge of anything internal or of the life after death, and who did not know that the 
Messiah's kingdom was a heavenly kingdom, therefore whenever they were in freedom they held profane worship on mountains and hills, and also in groves and forests. They also made for themselves high 
places to serve instead of mountains and hills, and carved images of a grove instead of groves, as becomes clear from many places in the Word, as in the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
The children of Israel served 
the baals and the groves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%203:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 3: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Israel made groves, provoking Jehovah to anger. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 14: <a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<p>Judah built for themselves high 
places and pillars and groves on every high hill, and under every leafy tree. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 14: <a href="23.htm">23</a>. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Books of Kings, </p>
<p>Israel built for themselves high places in every city. And they 
set up pillars and groves on every high hill and under every leafy tree. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 17: <a href="9.htm">9</a>,<a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<p>Manasseh king of Judah erected altars to Baal and made a grove, as Ahab 
king of Israel had done. And the carved image of a grove that he had made he placed in the house of God. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 21: <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, </p>
<p>From this it is evident that they also made for themselves carved images 
of a grove. The fact that king Josiah destroyed these images is mentioned in the same book, </p>
<p>Josiah made them bring out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels made for Baal and for the grove, and 
for the sun and moon, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem, and the booths which the women had woven [in the house of Jehovah] for the grove. He also cut down the groves 
which Solomon had made, as well as the grove in Bethel which Jeroboam had made. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 23: <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that King Hezekiah as well demolished such things is also stated in the same 
book, </p>
<p>Hezekiah king of Judah removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the grove, and broke to pieces the bronze serpent which Moses had made. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 18: <a href="4.htm">4</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The bronze serpent, 
it is clear, was holy in the time of Moses, but when that which was external came to be worshipped, that bronze serpent became profane and was therefore smashed to pieces, for the same reason 
that worship on mountains and in groves was forbidden. These matters are made clearer still in the Prophets: In Isaiah, </p>
<p>You who inflame yourselves among the gods under every leafy tree, who slay the 
children in the rivers, under projections of the rocks. Even in the rivers you have poured out a drink offering. you have brought a gift. On a high and lofty mountain you have set your habitation and 
presented yourself there to offer sacrifice. Isa. 57: <a href="5.htm">5</a>-<a href="7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>On that day a man will look to his Maker and his eyes will regard the Holy One of Israel. And he will not look to 
the altars, the work of his hands, and will not see what his fingers have made, both the groves and the solar pillars. Isa. 17: <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>. </p>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<p>I will cut down your carved images and your pillars 
from the midst of you, and you will bow down no more to the work of your hands. And I will root out your groves from the midst of you and destroy your cities. Micah 5: <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>That 
the slain may be in the midst of their idols, around their altars at every lofty hill, on all the mountain tops, and under every leafy tree, and under every entangled oak, the place where they offered 
an odour of rest to all their idols. Ezek. 6: <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this it is now evident where idolatrous worship originated, namely in the worship of the objects themselves that were representative 
and carried a spiritual meaning. The most ancient people, who lived before the Flood, saw in every single thing - in mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, in gardens, groves, forests, rivers, and 
waters, in fields and crops, in trees of every kind, also in living creatures of every kind, and in the heavenly bodies giving light - something that was a representative and a meaningful sign of the 
Lord's kingdom. But they never let their eyes, still less their minds, linger over such objects; for them these objects served instead as the means for thinking about the celestial and spiritual things 
that exist in the Lord's kingdom. Indeed so much was this the case with those objects that there was nothing at all in the whole natural world that failed to serve those people as means. It is indeed 
true that in itself every single thing in the natural order is representative; but at the present day this is an arcanum and scarcely believed by anyone. But after that which is celestial, which is 
essentially love to the Lord, had perished with man, the human race existed no longer in that state, that is, in the state of seeing from worldly objects the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's 
kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Nevertheless the Ancients after the Flood knew from traditions, and from collections made by certain people, that worldly objects had such meanings; and because these had such meanings 
they also regarded them as holy. From this arose the representative worship of the Ancient Church, which Church, being spiritual, did not enjoy any perception, only the knowledge, that a thing was 
so; for that Church, compared with the Most Ancient Church, dwelt in obscurity, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>. It did not however worship external things but by means of external things people called to mind those which were 
internal. Consequently when they turned to those representatives and meaningful signs they entered the holiness of worship. They were able to turn to them because they were moved by spiritual love, that 
is, by charity, which they made the essential of worship, and as a consequence holiness from the Lord was able to flow into their worship. But when the state of the human race had become so changed 
and perverted that people departed from the good of charity, and thus did not believe any longer in the existence of a heavenly kingdom or in life after death, but supposed - as is also supposed at 
the present day - that their condition was no different from that of animals (apart from the fact that they as human beings could think), holy representative worship was turned into idolatrous worship 
and external things came to be worshipped. This was why worship among many gentiles at that time, and even among Jews and Israelites, was not representative, but a worship of the representatives and 
meaningful signs, that is, of external things devoid of internal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 As regards 'groves' in particular, these had, among the ancients, varying meanings, such meanings depending in fact on the kinds 
of trees that the groves had in them. Groves where there were olives meant the celestial things of worship, groves where there were vines the spiritual things of worship, but groves where there were 
figs, cedars, firs, poplars, oaks, meant various things that were of a celestial and spiritual kind. Here however simply 'a grove' or plantation of trees is mentioned and by it was meant ideas belonging 
to the rational that were allied to doctrine and its cognitions; for trees in general mean perceptions, <a href="103.htm">103</a>, <a href="2163.htm">2163</a>, but when they have reference to the spiritual Church they mean cognitions, the reason 
being that the member of the spiritual Church has no other perceptions than those acquired through cognitions drawn from doctrine or from the Word. For such cognitions become part of his faith, and 
so of his conscience, from which he has perception.

`Plantavit lucum in Beersheba': quod significet doctrinam inde cum ejus cognitionibus et ejus quali, constat a significatione `luci,' et a significatione `Beersheba.'  Quod `lucos' attinet, in Antiqua 
Ecclesia fiebat cultus sanctus super montibus et in lucis; super montibus quia `montes' significabant caelestia cultus, et in lucis quia `luci' significabant spiritualia ejus; quamdiu Ecclesia illa, 
nempe Antiqua, in sua simplicitate fuit, tunc cultus eorum super montibus et in lucis sanctus erat, ex causa quia caelestia quae sunt amoris et charitatis, per illa quae alta et excelsa erant ut sunt 
montes et colles, repraesentabantur, et spiritualia quae inde, per fructifera et frondosa ut sunt horti et luci: sed postquam repraesentativa et significativa coeperunt fieri idololatrica, per id quod 
colerent externa absque internis, cultus ille sanctas factus est profanus; et ideo interdictum quod cultum haberent super montibus et in lucis: [2] quod Antiqui cultum sanctum habuerint super montibus, 
constare potest ex cap. xii Gen. de Abramo, 	Transtulit inde in montem ab oriente Betheli, et tetendit tentorium, Bethel a mari, et Ai ab oriente, et aedificavit ibi altare; et invocavit nomen Jehovae, 
vers. 8; n. 1449-1455; </p>
<p>et ex significatione `montis' quod sit caeleste amoris, n. 795, 796, 1430; quod etiam cultum sanctum habuerint in lucis, constat ex illis quae in hoc versu, `Plantavit 
Abraham lucum in Beersheba, et invocavit ibi nomen Dei aeternitatis,' tum a significatione `horti' quod sit intelligentia, n. 100, 108, 1588, et `arborum' quod sint perceptiones, n. 103, 2163: quod interdictum, 
constat ex his quae sequuntur; apud Mosen, 	Non plantabis tibi lucum omnis arboris juxta altare 	Jehovae Dei tui, quod facies tibi; et non eriges tibi statuam, quae odit Jehovah Deus tuus, 
Deut. xvi 21, 22: </p>
<p>apud eundum, 	Altaria gentium destruetis, statuas eorum confringetis, et lucos eorum diruetis, Exod. xxxiv 13; </p>
<p>	Et quod lucos igne comburerent, Deut. xii 3; </p>
<p>[3] et quia Judaei et 
Israelitae, apud quos ritus Antiquae Ecclesiae repraesentativus introductus est, solum in externis fuerunt, nec nisi quam idololatrae corde, quid internum, et quid vita post mortem, tum quod Messiae 
regnum esset caeleste, nescientes ac scire non volentes, quoties in libero fuerunt, cultum profanum habebant super montibus et collibus, ut et in lucis et silvis, tum quoque loco montium et collium sibi 
excelsa fecerunt, et loco lucorum sculptilia luci, ut constare potest (c)a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut in Libro Judicum, 	Filii Israelis servierunt Baalibus et lucis, iii 7: </p>
<p>in Libro Regum, 	Israel 
fecit lucos, ad irritandum Jehovam, 1 Reg.   xiv 15: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Jehudah aedificavit sibi excelsa, et statuas, et lucos, super omni colle alto, et sub omni arbore frondosa, 2 Reg. xiv 23: </p>
<p>alibi, 	Israel 
aedificavit sibi excelsa in omnibus urbibus, et statuerunt statuas et lucos super omni colle alto, et sub 	omni arbore frondosa, 2 Reg. xvii 9, 10: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Menasheh rex Jehudae erexit 
altaria Baali, et fecit lucum, sicut fecerat Ahab rex Israelis,... et posuit sculptile luci, quod fecerat, in domo Dei, 2 Reg. xxi 3, 7; </p>
<p>ex quo, quod etiam sculptilia luci sibi fecerint, patet; quae 
quod destructa sint a Joshia rege, ibidem, 	Joshiah fecit educi de templo Jehovae omnia vasa facta Baali et luco, et soli et lunae, et omni exercitui caelorum, et combussit ea extra Hierosolymam, ... 
et domos quas mulieres texuerunt ibi luco.... etiam succidit lucos, quos 	fecerat Salomo,... tum quoque lucum in Bethel, quem fecerat Jeroboam, 2 Reg. xxiii 4, 6, 7, 14, 15; </p>
<p>praeter quod a {1} Hizkia 
rege {2} talia diruta {3} sint, ibidem, 	Hizkiah rex Jehudae removit excelsa, et fregit statuas, et excidit lucum, et confregit serpentem aeris, quem fecerat Moses, 2 Reg. xviii 4; </p>
<p>[4] quod serpens 
aeris sanctus fuerit tempore Mosis, constat {4}, at cum externum coleretur, profanus factus (o)est, et {5} confractus, ex simili causa ac interdictus cultus super montibus et in lucis: haec adhuc constant 
apud Prophetas; apud Esaiam, 	Incalescentes diis sub omni arbore frondosa; mactantes natos in fluviis sub prominentiis petrarum; etiam fluviis effudisti libamen, obtulisti munus,... super monte 
alto et elato posuisti habitaculum tuum, et ibi obtulisti ad sacrificandum sacrificium, lvii 5-7: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	In die illo aspiciet homo ad Factorem suum, et oculi ejus ad Sanctum Israelis videbunt; 
et non aspiciet ad altaria opus manuum ejus, et quod fecerunt digiti ejus non videbit, et lucos et statuas solares, xvii 7, 8: </p>
<p>apud Micham, 	Exscindam sculptilia tua, et statuas tuas e medio tui, 
et non incurvabis te amplius operi manuum tuarum: et evellam lucos tuos e medio tui, et perdam urbes tuas, v 12, 13: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Ut sint confossi in medio idolorum eorum, circum altaria eorum 
ad omnem collem excelsum, in omnibus capitibus montium, et sub omni arbore frondosa, et sub omni quercu implexa, locum quo dederunt odorem quietis omnibus idolis suis, vi 13. [5] Exinde nunc patet 
e qua origine cultus idololatricus, nempe quod objecta repraesentantia et significantia colerentur; antiquissimi qui ante diluvium, in omnibus et singulis, sicut in montibus, in collibus, in campis, in 
vallibus, in hortis, lucis, silvis, in fluviis et aquis, in agris et sementibus, in arboribus omnis generis, in {6} animalibus etiam omnis generis, in luminaribus caeli, aliquid repraesentativum et 
significativum regni Domini videbant, sed nusquam haerebant oculis, minus mentibus, in objectis, sed erant illis media cogitandi de caelestibus et spiritualibus quae in regno Domini; et hoc usque adeo 
ut prorsus nihil esset in universa natura quod non illis inserviret pro mediis; in se etiam ita est quod omnia et singula in natura repraesentent, quod hodie est arcanum, et vix ab aliquo creditur: sed 
postquam caeleste, quod est amoris in Dominum, `apud hominem' periit, tunc non amplius genus humanum in illo statu fuit quod nempe ab objectis ut mediis videret caelestia et spiritualia regni Domini; 
[6] sed usque antiqui post diluvium a traditionibus et quorundam collectaneis sciebant quod illa significarentur; et quia significabant, etiam sancta habebant; inde cultus repraesentativus Ecclesiae 
Antiquae, quae Ecclesia quia spiritualis, non erat in perceptione quod ita esset, sed in cognitione, nam erat in obscuro respective, n. 2715, usque tamen non colebat externa, sed per externa recordati 
sunt internorum, et inde cum in repraesentativis et significativis illis erant, in sancto cultus erant; (m)potuerunt etiam, quia in spirituali amore erant, hoc est, in charitate, quam essentialem cultus 
fecerunt, quare sanctum a Domino in cultum eorum influere potuit:(n) at vero cum status humani generis ita mutatus est et perversus factus, ut se removerent a bono charitatis, ita nec amplius crederent 
dari regnum caeleste, aut vitam post mortem, sed quod in simili statu essent cum animalibus, praeterquam solum quod cogitarent, sicut etiam hodie, tunc cultus sanctus repraesentativus versus est 
in idololatricum, et colebantur externa; inde apud plures gentiles illo tempore, etiam apud Judaeos et Israelitas cultus erat non repraesentativus, sed repraesentativorum et significativorum, hoc est, 
externorum absque internis.  [7] Quod `lucos' in specie attinet, erant illi apud antiquos variae significationis, et quidem secundum species arborum quae ibi; `luci ubi oleae' significabant caelestia 
cultus; `luci ubi vites' significabant spiritualia (o)ejus, `luci autem ubi ficus, ubi cedri, ubi abietes, ubi populi, ubi quercus' varia quae caelestium et spiritualium erant; heic {7} lucus seu 
arboretum simpliciter nominatur, et significat illa quae sunt rationalium quae adjuncta doctrinae et ejus cognitionibus; `arbores' enim in genere significant perceptiones, n. 103, 2163, sed cum praedicantur 
de Ecclesia spirituali, significant cognitiones, ex causa quia spiritualis Ecclesiae homini non aliae perceptiones sunt quam quae per cognitiones e doctrina aut Verbo; hae enim fiunt fidei ejus, 
ita conscientiae (o)e qua perceptio. 	@1 i prius.$ 	@2 i Judae$ 	@3 destructa.$ 	@4 A has a space here, apparently for insertion of a reference, but there is no other reference in the Word to this 
worship, nor in previous nos. of AC.$ 	@5 i ideo.$ 	@6 inque.$ 	@7 heic, an old form of hic (= here), probably shows that it is adverbial, not demonstrative.$ </p>
