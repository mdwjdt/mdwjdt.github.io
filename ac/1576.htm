<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1576.</strong>“亚伯兰就对罗得说”表内在人对外在人如此说。这从此处“亚伯兰”代表内在人，“罗得”代表要分离的外在人清楚可知。亚伯兰之所以代表内在人，是因为他是相对罗得而言的，罗得是指外在人中要分离出去的元素。如前所述，外在人中既有一致的事物，也有不一致的事物。“罗得”在此表不一致的事物，故“亚伯兰”代表一致的事物，包括外在人中的事物；因为后者与内在人形成一个单一实体，并属于内在人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1576.</strong> Abram said to Lot means that this is what his inner self said to his outer self, as is established by the representation here of Abram as his inner self and from the representation of Lot as the outer self that needed to be separated. The reason Abram represents the inner self is that he is being seen in relation to Lot, who is the part of the outer self that needed to be separated.<br />The outer self, as noted, contains attributes that harmonize and attributes that clash [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547" target=_top>1547</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563" target=_top>1563-1564</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1568" target=_top>1568</a>]. Those that clash are Lot, here, so those that harmonize are Abram 钬?even the ones in the outer self, since they form a unit with the inner self and belong to the inner self. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1576</b></p><p><b>1576.</b>
Abram said unto Lot. That this signifies that the internal man said thus to the external, is evident from the representation of Abram, as being here the internal man; and from the representation of Lot, 
as being the external man that was to be separated. That Abram represents the internal man, is because he is spoken of relatively to Lot, who is that in the external man which was to be separated. 
There are in the external man, as before said, things that agree, and things that disagree. By "Lot" are here meant the things that disagree; by "Abram," therefore, are meant those which agree, including 
those which are in the external man; for these together with the internal man constitute one thing, and they belong to the internal man.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1576</b></p><p><b>1576.</b>
That 'Abram said to Lot' means that the internal man so addressed the external is clear from the representation of 'Abram' here as the internal man and from the representation of 'Lot' as the external 
man that was to be separated. The reason 'Abram' represents the internal man is that he is so relative to Lot, who is that element in the external man that was to be separated. In the external man, 
as has been stated, there are things that agree and those that do not. Here 'Lot' is those that do not agree, and therefore those that do are 'Abram', including those in the external man, for the latter 
form a single entity with the internal man and belong to the internal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1576</b>
</p><b>1576.</b>
Quod 'dixit Abram ad Lotum' significet quod ita internus homo dixerit ad externum, constat a repraesentatione 'Abrami' hic quod sit internus homo et a repraesentatione Loti quod externus qui separandus; 
quod 'Abram' repraesentet internum hominem, causa est quia est respective ad Lotum, qui est illud in externo homine quod separandum: in externo homine sunt, ut dictum, quae concordant et sunt quae 
discordant; quae discordant, hic est 'Lotus,' quare quae concordant sunt 'Abramus,' etiam quae in externo homine, nam illa unam rem constituunt cum interno, et sunt interni. </p>
