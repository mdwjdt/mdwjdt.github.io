Verses 18-20. And Moses went, and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray, and return into my brethren who are in Egypt, and I shall see whether they yet live. And Jethro 
said to Moses, Go in peace. And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; because all the men seeking thy soul are dead. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and made them ride upon 
the ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. "And Moses went, and returned," signifies continuation of the former life; "to Jethro his father-in-law," 
signifies in simple good; "and said to him, Let me go I pray, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt," signifies elevation to more interior and more spiritual life in the natural; "and I shall see 
whether they yet live," signifies the perception of that life; "and Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace," signifies assent and a devout wish; "and Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian," signifies enlightenment 
and confirmation from the Divine in this state; "Go, return into Egypt," signifies spiritual life in the natural; "because all the men seeking thy soul are dead," signifies the removal of the 
falsities that are endeavoring to destroy the life of truth and good; "and Moses took his wife," signifies good adjoined; "and his sons," signifies truths thence derived; "and made them ride upon the 
ass," signifies which would be of service to new intelligence; "and he returned into the land of Egypt," signifies in the natural mind; "and Moses took the rod of God in his hand," signifies that these 
things were from Divine power. </p>

in pace.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen in Midian, Vade, revertere Aegyptum, quia mortui sunt omnes viri quaerentes animam tuam.  Et accepit Moscheh uxorem suam, et filios suos, et equitare fecit illos
