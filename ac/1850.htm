<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1850.</strong>“我要惩罚”表惩罚和审判。这是显而易见的，无需解释。“判决”或“审判”并非指任何最后的审判，如绝大多数人所以为的那样，也就是说，天地都要逝去，新天新地要被造，如先知书和约翰在启示录中所言；因此，一切事都要过去。这种观点传播得如此广泛，甚至充斥了那些最有教养之人的头脑，以致他们也以为死人在最后审判之前不会复活。结果，由于这个时间已经预言，然而过了那么多世纪，他们仍没有看到它发生或即将发生的迹象，所以他们觉得还是确信没有这种事，因而他们不会复活靠谱些。但要知道，最后的审判，或天地毁灭的预言并非指这种事。从字义上看的确是这个意思，但在内义上根本不是这么回事。根据内义，最后的审判是指教会的末期，天地已经过去是指教会的内在和外在敬拜，当仁爱不复存在时，教会就不再是一个教会。<br />当一切仁与信终结，直觉不再存在时，对上古教会的最后审判就发生了，这是洪水前的情形。前面所论述的洪水本身就是对上古教会的最后审判。那时，天与地，也就是教会逝去了，一个新天与新地，即一个新教会被造，它就是前面所论述的古教会。古教会也有自己的末期，就在一切仁逐渐变得冷淡，一切信变得黑暗之时，大约在希伯时代。这段时期就是对古教会的最后审判，古教会就是那逝去的天与地。<br />而希伯来教会就是新天新地。该教会同样有自己的末期，或最后的审判。那时，它已变成偶像崇拜。然后，一个新教会在雅各的后代中兴起，它就是所谓的犹太教会，并且纯粹是仁与信的代表。在该教会，即雅各的后代中，既没有仁，也没有信，因此没有教会，只有教会的代表物。因为主在天上的国与地上的真教会之间的直接交流已变得不可能，故一种间接交流通过代表物实现。这个所谓教会的末期或它的最后审判就在主降世之时，因为那时代表性终止了，也就是说献祭及类似宗教活动终止了。为了使这些事终止，犹太人被逐出迦南地。<br />此后，一个新天新地，即一个新教会被造。这个新教会要被称作初期教会，它由主开始，后来逐渐发展壮大，并且一开始拥有仁与信。主在福音书和约翰的启示录中预言了该教会的毁灭，这种毁灭就是所谓的最后审判。如今不仅天地要逝去，而且一个新教会要在全球某个地区兴起。而现存教会仍停留在它的外在敬拜中，如犹太人那样。众所周知，犹太人的敬拜根本没有任何仁与信可言，即没有任何教会之物。总体上的最后审判到此为止。<br />具体来说，每个人死后立即面临最后的审判，因为那时他会进入来世。在来世，他一旦进入肉身时所具有的生命中，就会被判决，要么死，要么生。这最后的判决涉及这个人的一切细节。若被判为死，那么每一个细节都会定他的罪。因为其思维和意愿中的一切事，哪怕最小的事，无不类似于他的最后判决，也无不将他拖向死亡。同样，若被判为生，那么其思维和意愿的每一个细节都具有其最后判决的形像，并将其载向生命。因为人总体上如何，其思维和情感的每一个细节就如何。这些就是最后审判所表示的事。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1850.</strong> The symbolism of I will judge as visitation and judgment is self-evident.<br />Judging, or a judgment, does not mean any Last Judgment, as common thought holds. People picture the destruction of earth and sky, the creation of a new sky and a new earth (as the prophets and the Book of Revelation predict [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_17" target=_top>Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_22" target=_top>66:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_1" target=_top>Revelation 21:1</a>]), and therefore the passing away of everything that exists. This view has become so widespread that it has laid hold of the imagination in even the best informed, and laid hold so strongly that people do not believe the dead will rise again until that time. Such a time was indeed predicted, yet people see that although many centuries have passed since the prediction it has not happened and does not seem imminent. These circumstances combine to strengthen the confident in their confidence that nothing of the kind can happen and therefore that they will not rise again.<br />It is important to know, however, that the Last Judgment and the obliteration of earth and sky does not mean anything of the kind. Such a picture does agree with the literal meaning but not with the inner meaning at all. According to the inner meaning, the Last Judgment means the church's final days. The sky and earth that will be destroyed mean the church, so far as its inward and outward worship goes, which becomes no church at all when charity fails.<br />[2] The last judgment of the very earliest church took place when all charity and faith died out and when perception ended. This happened just before the Flood. The same flood described earlier was the last judgment of that church [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_1-22" target=_top>Genesis 6</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_1-22" target=_top>8</a>]. In it the sky and the earth — the church — were destroyed and a new sky and earth were created. In other words, a new church, called the ancient church, was created, and this church has also been discussed.{*1} It too had a final period, specifically when all charity froze and all faith went dark, around the time of Eber. This period was the last judgment of that church, which was the sky and earth that were destroyed.<br />[3] The new sky and earth were the Hebrew church, which again had its final period, or last judgment, when it became idolatrous. So a new church was raised up, this time among Jacob's descendants. It was called the Jewish religion and was nothing more than a church that represented charity and faith. In that religion, among Jacob's descendants, there was no charity or faith, so there was also no church, but only a representation of a church. The reason was that direct communication of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens with any true church on earth was impossible, so indirect communication was set up through representations. The final period or last judgment of this "church" occurred when the Lord came into the world, because representative acts — specifically sacrifices and other rituals like them — came to an end at that point. The disappearance of these rituals was brought about by the expulsion of Jacob's descendants from the land of Canaan.{*2} [4] Afterward, a new sky and earth were created. That is, a new church was created, which has to be called the nascent [Christian] church. It was started by the Lord and afterward grew gradually stronger, and in its early days it possessed charity and faith. The Lord predicts the death of this church in the Gospels, as does John in the Book of Revelation, and its death is what people call the Last Judgment. Not that heaven and earth will now be obliterated, but that a new church will be raised up in some region of the globe, leaving the current church to remain in its superficial worship, as Jews remain in theirs. The worship of these people is devoid of charity and faith, or in other words, of religion, as is fairly well known. Such is the Last Judgment in general.<br />[5] In particular, we each have an individual last judgment right after we die. We pass into the other world, where we come into the way of life we adopted in the body and receive a verdict of either death or life.<br />We have an even more particular last judgment if we receive a verdict of death. Absolutely everything in us then condemns us, since there is no detail of our thought or intent so small that it does not reflect our final judgment and drag us to our death. If we receive a verdict of life, it is the same: absolutely every detail of our thought and intent contains an image of our final judgment and carries us toward life. Our overall character is the same character we display in each of our thoughts and feelings.<br />This is what is meant by the Last Judgment.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg describes the ancient church throughout his treatment of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_1-22" target=_top>Genesis 6</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>11</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1850/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_547" target=_top>547-1382</a>). [LHC]<br />{*2} Apparently this refers to the ending of the priestly rituals of animal sacrifice with the destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 c.e., though strictly speaking the Jewish people were not entirely displaced.

Will I judge. That this signifies visitation and judgment, may be seen without explication. By "judging," or "judgment," there is not signified any last judgment, as people in general suppose, that is, 
that the heaven and the earth are to perish, and that so a new heaven and a new earth will be created, as spoken of in the Prophets and in Revelation; and thus that all things are to perish, which 
opinion has spread itself so widely that it has even taken possession of the minds of those who are best instructed; and this to such a degree that they do not believe that the dead are to rise except 
at that time. And therefore because this time was foretold, and still, after so many centuries have since passed by, they see that it has not come and is not at hand, feeling safe they confirm themselves 
in their assurance that there is no such thing, and therefore that they will not rise again. But it is to be known that by the last judgment, or by the destruction of heaven and earth, no such thing 
is meant. According to the sense of the letter it is so; but not at all according to the internal sense: in this sense the last judgment means the last time of the church; the heaven and earth that 
will perish, mean the church as to internal and external worship, which becomes no church when there is no charity.  [2] There was a last judgment of the Most Ancient Church when all charity and faith 
had failed, and when there was no perception, as was the case just before the flood. The flood itself, treated of above, was the last judgment of that church; heaven and earth, that is, the church, 
then perished; and a new heaven and a new earth, that is, a new church, were created, which was called the Ancient Church, and which also has been treated of. This church likewise had its last time, 
namely, when all charity grew cold and all faith was darkened, which was about the time of Eber. This time was the last judgment of that church; which was the heaven and earth that had perished.  [3] 
The Hebrew Church was a new heaven and a new earth, and this too had its last time, or last judgment, when it became idolatrous; and then a new church was raised up among the descendants of Jacob, which 
was called the Jewish Church, and which was a church that was merely representative of charity and faith. In this church, that is, among the descendants of Jacob, there was neither charity nor faith, 
and therefore no church, but only the representative of a church, for the reason that it had become impossible for there to be immediate communication of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens with any 
true church on earth, and therefore a mediate communication was effected by means of representatives. The last time of this so-called church, or its last judgment, was when the Lord came into the world; 
for the representatives then ceased, that is, the sacrifices and similar rites; and in order that these might cease, the Jews were cast out of the land of Canaan.  [4] After this a new heaven and 
a new earth were created, that is, a new church, which is to be called the Primitive Church, which was commenced by the Lord, and afterwards gradually became stronger, and which at first was in charity 
and faith. The destruction of this church is foretold by the Lord in the Gospels, and by John in Revelation; and this destruction is what is called the Last Judgment. Not that heaven and earth are 
now to perish, but that in some quarter of the globe a new church will be raised up, the present one remaining in its external worship, as the Jews do in theirs, in whose worship it is well known that 
there is nothing of charity and faith, that is, nothing of the church. So far as regards the last judgment in general.  [5] In particular, there is a last judgment for everyone immediately after he 
dies; for he then passes into the other life, in which, when he comes into the life that he had had in the body, he is adjudged either to death or to life. There is also a last judgment in the singular, 
for with a man who is adjudged to death, every single thing condemns him, for there is nothing in his thought and will, not even the least thing, that does not resemble his last judgment, and that 
does not drag him to death. In like manner with the man who is adjudged to life: in him every single thing of his thought and of his will presents an image of his last judgment, and all carry him on 
to life. For such as is man in general, such is he in the singulars of his thought and of his affection. These are the things that are signified by the last judgment. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1850</b></p><p><b>1850.</b>
That 'will I judge' means visitation and judgement becomes clear without explanation. Judging or judgement does not mean some last judgement, as most people suppose, that is to say, a time when heaven 
and earth are to pass away and then a new heaven and a new earth are to be created, as described in the Prophets and in the Book of Revelation, and thus a time when all things are to be destroyed. This 
conception has become so widespread that it has taken possession of even the best-informed minds, so much so that they do not believe the dead are to rise again until that time. As a consequence because 
that time has been foretold and yet after the passing of so many centuries since the prediction was made they do not see it happening or about to do so, they feel safe in confirming themselves 
in their assurance that there is no truth in the idea, thus that they are not going to rise again. But it should be recognized that no such thing is meant by the Last Judgement, that is, by the prediction 
that heaven and earth are to be destroyed. According to the sense of the letter that is indeed the meaning, but not according to the internal sense. By the Last Judgement, according to the internal 
sense, is meant the final period of the Church, and by heaven and earth's passing away is meant the Church as regards internal and external worship - a Church that ceases to be a Church when no charity 
exists. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A Last Judgement of the Most Ancient Church took place when all charity and faith were at an end and when no perception existed, as was the situation just before the Flood. The Flood 
itself, which has been dealt with above, was the Last Judgement of that Church. At that point heaven and earth, that is, the Church, passed away, and a new heaven and a new earth, that is, a new Church 
called the Ancient Church, was created, which too has been dealt with. This Church as well had its final period, namely when all charity was growing cold and all faith was being blacked out. This 
was about the time of Eber. This period was the Last Judgement of that Church, which was the heaven and earth that passed away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The new heaven and the new earth was the Hebrew Church. This too 
had its final period or Last Judgement when it had become idolatrous. A new Church was as a consequence established, and this was accomplished among the descendants of Jacob. That which was called the 
Jewish Church was nothing other than a Church representative of charity and faith. In that Church, that is, among the descendants of Jacob, no charity or faith existed, and therefore no Church existed 
but merely the representative of a Church. This was so because direct communication of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens with any true Church on earth was not possible, and therefore an indirect communication 
by means of representatives was effected. The last period or Last Judgement of this so- called Church was when the Lord came into the world, for at that time representatives came to an end, 
that is to say, the sacrifices and similar practices did so; and to bring these to an end the Jews were expelled from the land of Canaan. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 After this a new heaven and a new earth were created, 
namely a new Church which must be called the Primitive Church, which was begun by the Lord and after that gradually grew stronger, and which at first possessed charity and faith. The destruction of this 
Church is foretold by the Lord in the Gospels and by John in the Book of Revelation, and it is this destruction which is called the Last Judgement. Not that heaven and earth are now going to pass 
away but that a new Church will be raised up in some part of the world, while the present one continues in existence with its external worship just as the Jews do with theirs. As is quite well known, 
their worship includes no charity or faith at all, that is, nothing of the Church. So much for the Last Judgement in general.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In particular there is a last judgement for everyone immediately after 
he has died, for at this point he passes over into the next life, in which, once he has entered into the life that was his in the body, he undergoes a judgement that points either to death or to 
life. This last judgement involves every detail of the person. With him whose judgement is to death every single detail condemns him, for there is nothing in his thought and will, not the smallest thing, 
that does not show the same as his individual last judgement or draw him towards death. But with him whose judgement is to life, every single detail of his thought or will in a similar way possesses 
the image of his individual last judgement and bears him towards life. For as is the person in general, so is he in every detail of his thought and affection. These are the things meant by the Last 
Judgement. </p>

'Judicabo Ego': quod significet visitationem et judicium, constare potest absque explicatione.  Per 'judicare seu judicium' non significatur aliquod ultimum judicium, sicut vulgus opinatur, nempe quod 
caelum et terra peritura, et sic quod novum caelum et nova terra creanda, de quibus apud Prophetas et in Apocalypsi, ac ita quod omnia interitura; quae opinio tam late se diffudit ut etiam instructissimorum 
animos occupaverit, immo usque adeo ut non credant mortuos resurrecturos quam eo tempore; quare quia praedictum hoc tempus, et usque post tot inde saecula praeterlapsa vident non evenire nec 
instare, securi se confirmant in sua securitate quod tale nihil sit, ita quod non resurrecturi: sed sciendum quod nusquam per Ultimum Judicium, seu per quod caelum et terra interitura, tale intellectum 
sit; secundum sensum litterae ita est, nusquam autem secundum sensum internum; secundum sensum internum per Ultimum Judicium intelligitur ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, per caelum et terram quae peritura, 
intelligitur Ecclesia quoad cultum internum et externum, quae Ecclesia nulla fit quando nulla charitas.  [2] Ultimum Judicium fuit Antiquissimae Ecclesiae cum desiit omnis charitas et fides, et cum 
nulla perceptio, quod factum proxime ante diluvium; ipsum diluvium de quo supra, fuit Ultimum Judicium istius Ecclesiae; tunc periit caelum et terra, hoc est, Ecclesia, [3] et novum caelum et nova ter 
creata sunt, hoc est, nova Ecclesia quae Ecclesia Antiqua appellat de qua etiam actum est; haec quoque Ecclesia suum ultimum tempus habuit, tunc nempe cum omnis charitas frigescebat et omnis fides obtenebrabatur, 
quod fuit circa tempus Eberi; hoc tempus fuit Ultimum Judicium istius Ecclesiae, quae fuit caelum et terra quae perierunt; caelum novum et terra nova fuit Ecclesia Hebraea; haec quoque 
suum ultimum tempus seu Ultimum Judicium habuit cum idololatrica facta; quare nova Ecclesia exsuscitata, et hoc apud Jacobi postero quae Ecclesia Judaica appellata quae non alia Ecclesia erat quam Ecclesia 
repraesentativa charitatis et fidei; in illa Ecclesia, seu apud posteros Jacobi, nulla fuit charitas et fides, quare nec ulla Ecclesia, sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, ob causam quia immediata 
non dari potuit communicatio regni Domini in caelis cum aliqua Ecclesia vera in terris, quare facta est communicatio mediata per repraesentativa; hujus sit dictae Ecclesiae ultimum tempus seu Ultimum 
Judicium fuit cum Dominus in mundum venit, nam tunc cessarunt repraesentativa, nempe sacrificia et similes ritus, qui ut cessarent, ex terra Canaane ejecti sunt: [4] post hoc, novum caelum et nova 
terra creata sunt, nempe nova Ecclesia quae dicenda est Ecclesia Primitiva, incepta a Domino et dein successive corroborata, quae primitus in charitate et fide fuit; de hujus Ecclesiae interitu praedicitur 
a Domino apud Evangelistas, et per Johannem in Apocalypsi, qui interitus est qui vocatur Ultimum Judicium; non quod nunc caelum et terra peritura, sed quod nova Ecclesia in quodam terrarum orbe 
excitabitur manente hac in suo cultu externo sicut Judaei in suo; in quorum cultu quod nihil charitatis et fidei sit, hoc est, nihil Ecclesiae, satis	notum est; haec in communi de Ultimo Judicio.  [5] 
In particulari, est ultimum judicium cuivis statim cum moritur, nam tunc transit in alteram vitam, in qua cum venit in vitam quam habuit in corpore judicatur vel ad mortem vel ad vitam.  Ultimum judicium 
quoque est in singulari; apud hominem qua judicatur ad mortem, sunt omnia et singula quae condemnant, nam nihil tam minimum datur in ejus cogitatione et voluntate quod non simile est ultimo ejus 
judicio, et eum ad mortem trahit; apud hominem qui judicatur ad vitam, similiter omnia et singula ejus cogitationis et voluntatis apud eum habent ultimi ejus judicii imaginem, et illum ferunt ad vitam; 
nam qualis homo est in communi, talis est in singularibus cogitationis et affectionis.  Haec sunt quae per Ultimum Judicium significantur. </p>
