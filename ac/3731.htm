Verses 20-22. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way wherein I walk, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, and I return in peace to my father's 
house, Jehovah shall be to me for God. And this stone which I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house; and all that Thou shalt give me, tithing I will tithe it to Thee. "And Jacob vowed a 
vow, saying," signifies a state of Providence; "if God will be with me and will keep me in this way wherein I walk," signifies continuously Divine; "and will give me bread to eat," signifies even to conjunction 
with Divine good; "and raiment to put on," signifies conjunction with Divine truth; "and I return in peace to my father's house," signifies even to perfect union; "and Jehovah shall be to me 
for God," signifies that the Divine natural should also be Jehovah; "and this stone which I have set up for a pillar," signifies truth which is the ultimate; "shall be God's house" signifies here as 
before the Lord's kingdom in the ultimate of order, in which are higher things as in their house; "and all that Thou shalt give me, tithing I will tithe it to Thee," signifies that He would make all 
things Divine in general and in particular by His own power. </p>

Verses 20-22 And Jacob mate a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and guard me on this road on which I am walking, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, and I come back in peace to my 
father's house, then Jehovah will be my God. And this stone which I have placed as a pillar will be God's house; and of all that You give me I will surely give You a tenth. </p>
<p>'Jacob made a vow, saying' 
means a state of Providence. 'If God will be with me, and guard me on this road on which I am walking' means the ever-present Divine. 'And will give me bread to eat' means even to the point of being 
joined to Divine Good. 'And clothing to wear' means being joined to Divine Truth. 'And I come back in peace to my father's house' means even to the point of perfect union. 'Then Jehovah will be my God' 
means that the Divine Natural also is Jehovah. 'And this stone which I have placed as a pillar' means truth as it exists in the ultimate degree. 'Will be God's house' means here, as previously, the 
Lord's kingdom as it exists in the ultimate degree of order where higher things are accommodated as in their own house. 'And of all that You give me I will surely give You a tenth' means that by His 
own Divine power He made every single thing Divine. </p>

Vers. 20-22.  Et vovit Jacob votum, dicendo, Si fuerit Deus cum me, et custodiverit me in via hac, quam ego ambulans, et dederit mihi panem ad edendum, et vestem ad induendum; Et rediero in pace 
ad domum patris mei, et erit Jehovah mihi in Deum. Et lapis hic, quem posui statuam, erit Domus Dei; et omne quod dederis mihi decimando decimabo illud tibi. `Vovit Jacob votum, dicendo' significat 
Providentiae statum: `si fuerit Deus cum me, et custodiverit me in via hac, quam ego ambulans' significat continuum Divinum: `et dederit mihi panem ad edendum' significat usque ad conjunctionem cum 
Divino Bono: `et vestem ad induendum' significat conjunctionem cum Divino Vero: `et rediero in pace ad domum patris mei' significat usque ad perfectam unionem: `et erit Jehovah mihi in Deum' significat 
quod Divinum Naturale etiam Jehovah: `et lapis hic quem posui statuam' significat verum quod ultimum: `erit domus Dei' significat, hic ut prius, regnum Domini in ultimo ordinis, in quo superiora 
ut in sua domo: `et omne quod dederis mihi, decimando decimabo illud tibi' significat quod omnia et singula ex propria potentia Divina fecerit. </p>
