<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1879节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1879．有一次，我在床上被告知，恶灵正密谋对付我，企图窒息我。但由于主的庇护，我感觉十分安全，于是无视这些威胁，继续睡觉。但半夜醒来，我感觉呼吸不是来自我自己，而是来自天堂。因为我清楚发觉没有一丝呼吸是我的。这时，我听说有一场阴谋正在进行，参与者是那些仇视圣言内在事物（也就是信之真理本身，因为这些构成圣言的内在事物）之人。他们仇视这些事物，是因为它们违背其谬论、信念和贪欲，而字义则给予支持。<br />他们的企图失败后，为首的试图进入我身体的内在部位，甚至想刺穿我的心脏，而且他们也被允许进入其中。我一直以准确清晰的感觉察知所发生的这一切，因为凡属于灵的内层被打开的人都能同时用肉体感官觉察这种事。但那时，我被带入一种天堂状态，这使得我毫不费力地逐出了这些来访者，更不用说向所造成的伤害报仇了。他们现在声称那里有平安，但很快就仿佛丧失理智，开始呼出报复，并奋力实现他们的意图，不过，这一切都徒劳无功。后来，他们自己就四散了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1879.</strong> Once when I was lying in bed I was told that evil spirits were plotting against me, intending to suffocate me. The Lord was keeping me safe and sound, though, so I scoffed at the threat and went to sleep. Waking up in the middle of the night, however, I sensed that I was breathing not under my own power but heaven's. I had no respiration of my own, as I could plainly tell. Then I was told that the conspirators were nearby, and that they were the type that hate the deeper content of the Word, or in other words, genuine religious truth (since this is the deeper content of the Word). The reason they hate it is that it attacks their illusions, delusions, and desires, which the literal sense could be made to defend.<br />[2] Later, when their efforts had failed, the ringleaders tried to invade the inner organs of my body and penetrate right to my heart, where they were even let in. I sensed quite plainly what was happening the whole time, since anyone whose inner levels (those of the spirit) are opened receives also the ability to sense these kinds of things. I was then brought into a certain heavenly frame of mind, in which I did not attempt to rid myself of these guests, let alone avenge the wrong they had done. This calmed them down, they said at the time, but directly afterward they seemed to go berserk. Seeking revenge, they tried to finish off their efforts, but in vain. Eventually they scattered on their own. </p>

On one occasion while in bed I was told that evil spirits were conspiring against me with the intention of suffocating me, but as I was safe and felt secure under the Lord's keeping, I disregarded the 
threats and went to sleep. But awaking in the middle of the night, I felt that I was not breathing of myself, but from heaven, for there was nothing of my own respiration, as I plainly perceived. It 
was then said that the band of conspirators was present, and that it was composed of those who hold in hatred the interior things of the Word (that is, the very truths of faith, for these are the interiors 
of the Word), and who thus hate them because they are contrary to their fallacies, persuasions, and cupidities, which the sense of the letter might be brought to support.  [2] After their attempt 
had failed, their leaders tried to enter into the viscera of my body, and to penetrate even to the heart, and to this also they were admitted. This was all the time perceived by manifest sensation, 
for one to whom the interiors of the spirit are opened, gets at the same time a sensible perception of such things. But I was then introduced into a kind of celestial state, which was that I made no 
effort to repel these visitors, still less to avenge the injury. They then said that there was peace; but soon they were as if deprived of rationality, breathing out vengeance, and striving to carry 
out their purpose, but in vain. They afterwards dispersed of themselves. </p>

Once when in bed I was told that evil spirits were plotting against me, intending to suffocate me, but because I was in the safe care and keeping of the Lord I ignored those threats, and went to sleep. 
But in the middle of the night, having woken up I had the sensation of breathing not from myself but from heaven, for as I clearly perceived there was nothing of my own breathing present. At that point 
it was declared that a conspiracy was afoot and I was told that it involved spirits who hate the interior things of the Word, that is, the truths of faith themselves, for these constitute the interior 
things of the Word. They hated these things because they were contrary to their own illusions, persuasions, and desires, to which the sense of the letter might lend support. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 After their attempt 
had failed, the leaders then tried to enter the inner parts of my body and to penetrate through to my heart, into which they were also allowed to enter. All along I perceived what was happening 
from an unmistakable sensation of it, for everyone whose interiors which belong to the spirit have been opened is enabled at the same time to perceive such things within his physical senses. But I was 
brought at that point into some kind of heavenly state, one in which I made no attempt to drive away those [unwelcome] visitors, still less to avenge the wrong that had been done. They now said that 
there was peace but shortly after this they were seemingly deprived of rationality, and began to breathe revenge and to complete what they were intent on doing. But it was all in vain. At length they 
dispersed of themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1879</b>
</p><b>1879.</b>
Cum in lecto essem, dictum mihi quod conspirarent contra me spiritus mali, animo me suffocandi, sed quia tutus et securus a Domino, minas illas vilipendi, et indormivi; at media nocte expergefactus, 
sensi quod non respirarem a me sed e caelo, nam nihil meae respirationis erat quod manifeste percepi; dicebatur tunc quod conspiratio adesset, et dictum quod essent illi qui odio habent interiora Verbi, 
hoc est, ipsas veritates fidei, nam hae sunt interiora Verbi, et hoc quia contra illorum fallacias, persuasiones et cupiditates, quibus sensus litterae ratiocinari posset: [2] postea antesignani, 
cum irritus factus eorum conatus, tentabant intrare in corporis mei viscera, et penetrare usque ad cor, quo etiam admissi; quod semper manifesto sensu perceptum, nam cui aperta sunt interiora quae spiritus, 
simul etiam sensitivam perceptionem talium accipit; at tunc in statum quendam caelestem immissus sum, qui erat quod nihil conarer repellere hospites illos, minus injuriam vindicare; dicebant tunc 
quod pacificum sit; sed mox velut rationalitate orbati sunt, vindictam spirantes, et conatus suos perficere conantes, sed incassum; dissipati sunt dein a semet. </p>
