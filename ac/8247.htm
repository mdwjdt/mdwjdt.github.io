<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8247节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8247.</strong>他们之所以喜欢愉快、微笑的脸，是因为在他们的星球，几乎每个人的脸都是这样。这是因为他们根本不担忧未来，不为俗事操心。这些东西会给人的心灵，因而给他们的脸带来悲伤和焦虑；对那些并不良善的人来说，即便愉快和微笑在他们脸上，也只是在外皮，而不是从内存在于纤维里面。木星居民不是这样。他们之所以喜欢嘴唇周围撅起的脸，是因为他们说话时，大部分是通过脸来说的，尤其通过嘴唇周围的区域；还因为他们从不伪装，也就是说，从来不说与他们的所想不同的话。因此，他们不控制自己的脸，而是任它自由表达。而那些从小就学习伪装的人则不然。由于这个原因，他们的脸从内在被控制，以防止他们所想的任何东西从中闪耀出来。表面上看，它不允许自由表达，而是预备被赋予表达的自由，或照狡猾的命令收回。这一事实通过检查嘴唇的纤维可以看出来；因为那里有多种折叠和缠结在一起的系列纤维。这些纤维被造不只是为了咀嚼和说话，还为了表达低层心智中的观念。</p>

The reason why they were pleased with the cheerful and smiling faces, was that in their earth the faces of almost all are such, and this for the reason that they have no solicitude about future things, 
nor have they worldly cares, for these are things which bring sadness and anxiety into the lower mind, and from this into the face; and if with those who are not good there is cheerfulness and a smile 
in the face, it is in the outer skin, and not in the fibers from within. It is otherwise with the inhabitants of Jupiter. The reason why they were pleased with the faces that were prominent about 
the lips, was that most of their speech is effected by means of the face, and especially by means of the region of it that is around the lips; and also because they never dissemble, that is, speak otherwise 
than they think. For this reason they do not control their faces, but let them have free play. It is otherwise with those who from childhood have learned to dissemble. Their face is consequently 
contracted from within, lest anything of the thought should shine out therefrom. Neither has it free play outwardly, but is kept ready for letting out, or for drawing in, just as cunning dictates. The 
truth of this can be seen from an examination of the fibers round about the lips; for there are manifold series of fibers there, folded together and united together, that were not created for chewing 
and verbal speech only, but also for expressing the ideas of the lower mind. </p>

The reason why they liked the cheerful and smiling faces was that almost everyone's face on their planet looks like that. This is so because they do not worry at all about anything in the future, and 
they are not bothered about worldly things. For these are what bring sorrow and worry to people's minds and therefore to their faces; and in the case of those who are not good, even if cheerfulness and 
smiles are on their faces these are only skin-deep, and are not present inwardly, within their fibres. The inhabitants of Jupiter are different from this. One reason why they liked the faces which 
jutted out around the lips is that when they speak they do so for the most part by means of the face, in particular by means of the area around the lips, and another reason is that they never dissemble, 
that is, speak differently from what they think. They do not therefore coerce their face but allow it freedom of expression. But people who since childhood have learned to dissemble are different. 
Their face is for that reason controlled from within to prevent anything of what they think from shining out from it. Outwardly it is not allowed freedom of expression, but is held ready to be given freedom 
of expression or to be controlled as craftiness dictates. An examination of the fibres round about the lips will establish the truth of the matter, for in that area there is a multiplicity of interwoven 
and interlocking groups of fibres. These have not been created merely for eating and uttering spoken words, but also for expressing ideas in the mind. </p>

</p><b>8247.</b>
Quod facies ridentes et hilares arriderent, erat quia in illorum tellure facies paene omnium tales {1}sint, et hoc ex causa quia nulla illis sollicitudo est de futuris, nec mundana illis curae sunt; 
nam haec sunt quae inducunt triste et anxium animis et inde faciebus; sique apud {2}non bonos est hilaritas et risus in faciebus, est in cute externa, non autem in fibris ab interno; aliter apud incolas 
jovis.  Quod facies {3}arriderent quae circum labra prominebant, erat causa quia plurimum loquelae illorum fit per faciem, et imprimis per regionem ejus circum labra; et quoque quia nusquam simulant, 
hoc est, aliter loquuntur quam cogitant; idcirco faciem suam non cogunt sed libere emittunt aliter apud illos qui a pueritia didicerunt simulare; eorum facies inde contrahitur ab interiore, ne inde 
aliquid cogitationis eluceat; ab exteriore autem nec (x)emittitur, sed tenetur parata ad emittendum et ad contrahendum prout calliditas suadet.  Ex inspectis fibris circumcirca labra veritas potest 
constare, sunt enim fibrarum series ibi multiplices, complicatae, et consertae, quae non ad manducationem et ad loquelam per voces solum creatae sunt, sed etiam ad exprimendas animi ideas. 	@1 sunt$ 	@2
