Verses 5-7. And he slept and dreamed a second time, and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, fat and good. And behold seven ears thin and parched with the east wind sprung up after them. 
And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold it was a dream. "And he slept," signifies an obscure state; "and dreamed a second time," signifies what was provided; 
"and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk," signifies the memory-knowledges of the natural joined together; "fat and good," signifies into which the things of faith and charity could 
be applied; "and behold seven ears, thin," signifies memory-knowledges of no use; "and parched with the east wind," signifies full of cupidities; "sprung up after them," signifies appeared near; "and 
the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears," signifies that the memory-knowledges of no use banished the good memory- knowledges; "and Pharaoh awoke," signifies a general state of enlightenment; 
"and behold it was a dream," signifies in that obscurity. </p>

Verses 5-7 And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven heads of grain were coming up on one stalk, fat and good. And behold, seven heads, thin and scorched by an east wind, were sprouting 
after them. And the thin heads swallowed up the seven fat and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.  </p>
<p>'And he fell asleep' means a state of obscurity. 'And dreamed a second 
time' means the provision that had been made. 'And behold, seven heads of grain were coming up on one stalk' means facts known to the natural, which facts existed linked together. 'Fat and good' 
means into which facts matters of faith and charity could be instilled. 'And behold, seven heads, thin' means facts that are useless. 'And scorched by an east wind' means full of evil desires. 'Were sprouting 
after them' means appearing next to them. 'And the thin heads swallowed up the seven fat and full heads' means that the facts which were useless banished the facts that were good. 'And Pharaoh 
awoke' means a general state of enlightenment. 'And behold, it was a dream' means in that obscurity. </p>

Vers. 5-7.  Et obdormivit et somniavit secundo, et ecce septem aristae ascendentes in calamo uno, pingues et bonae. Et ecce septem aristae graciles et exustae euro, germinantes post illas. Et absorbebant 
aristae graciles septem aristas pingues et plenas; et expergefactus Pharaoh, et ecce somnium. `Et obdormivit' significat statum obscurum: `et somniavit secundo' significat provisum: `et ecce septem 
aristae ascendentes in calamo uno' significat scientifica quae naturalis, conjuncta; `pingues et bonae' significat quibus illa quae fidei et charitatis inapplicari possent: `et ecce septem aristae 
graciles' significat scientifica nullius usus: `et exustae euro' significat plena cupiditatum: `germinantes post illas' significat apparentes juxta: `et absorbebant aristae graciles septem aristas pingues 
et plenas' significat quod scientifica nullius usus exterminarent scientifica bona: `et expergefactus Pharaoh' significat communem illustrationis statum: `et ecce somnium' significat in obscuro illo. </p>
