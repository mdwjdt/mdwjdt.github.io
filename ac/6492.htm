<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6492.</strong>有一次，我父亲出现在我的梦中；我与他交谈，说，儿子自主之后，就不应该像以前那样认他的父亲为父亲；在抚养儿子期间之所以要承认父亲，是因为那时父亲代替了主；在此期间，若没有父亲的引导，儿子不知道该怎样行。但是，当儿子变得自主，能独立思考，并且他觉得自己似乎能独立掌控自己时，主必是他的父，之前他的属世父亲一直担当摄政王的角色。这些话是我在梦里说的。当我醒来时，一个长长的卷轴似乎从天而降，卷轴上拴着极其漂亮的天蓝色织物。这个物件漂亮得无法形容。我被告知，天使经常互送这样的礼物。</p>

In a dream my father appeared to me, and I spoke with him, saying that after a son becomes his own master he ought not to acknowledge his father as father, as before; for the reason why the father is 
to be acknowledged during the bringing up of the son, is that the father is then in the Lord's stead, nor does a son know at that time what he ought to do except by the direction of his father. But when 
a son becomes his own master, and competent to think for himself, and seems to himself to be able to direct himself from himself, then the Lord must be his Father, whose vice-regent his natural father 
had been. These things I spoke in my dream. When I awoke, there seemed to descend from heaven a long roll fastened to rods, and tied by most beautiful woven knots of an azure color; the beauty of 
this object was indescribable. It was said that the angels make such presents to one another. </p>

My father once appeared to me in a dream, and I spoke to him, saying that after he has become responsible for himself a son ought not to acknowledge his father as his father, as he did previously. For 
the reason why he should acknowledge him when he is being brought up is that at that time his father stands in place of the Lord; and during that time he does not know, except as his father leads him, 
how he should act. But when he becomes responsible for himself and can think for himself, and it seems to him that he can control his life for himself, the Lord must be his Father, in whose place his 
natural father had previously functioned. I spoke these things in my dream, and when I woke up there seemed to come down from heaven a long scroll attached to rods and tied round by means of very beautiful 
pieces of fabric of a bright blue colour. Their beauty was beyond description. I was told that angels often make such gifts to one another. </p>

</p><b>6492.</b>
In somnio apparebat mihi pater meus, et loquebar cum illo, dicens quod filius non agnoscere debeat patrem suum pro patre, {1}sicut prius, postquam sui juris factus est; nam quod agnoscendus cum educatur, 
est quia tunc loco Domini est, nec nisi quam ex manuductione patris novit tunc quid aget; at cum sui juris et suae cogitationis fit, et se ex semet manuducere posse sibi videtur, quod tunc Dominus 
pater ejus erit, cujus vicem naturalis ejus pater prius obiverat.  Haec locutus sum in somnio; {2}cum evigilatus, videbatur  descendere e caelo {3}volumen longum applicatum baculis, et colligatum per 
pulcherrimas contexturas coloratas candido caeruleo; pulchritudo non describi potest; dictum est quod talia dona angelis sint inter se. @1 ut$ @2 i et$ @3 i versus me$ </p>
