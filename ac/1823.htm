<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1823节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1823.</strong>“取一头三岁的母牛犊，一只三岁的母山羊，一只三岁的公绵羊”表教会的属天事物的代表物。这从用来献祭的这些动物的含义清楚可知。凡心智健全的人不会以为用来献祭的各种动物仅仅指祭物；或者，公牛、小公牛或牛犊的含义与绵羊、小山羊、母山羊的一样，这些和羔羊的含义一样；也不会以为“斑鸠和雏鸽”是一个意思。事实上，每种生物都自己特定的含义。这从以下事实很清楚地看出来：所献的动物无论如何不能用另一种动物来代替，经上明确说明了分别用于日常燔祭、献祭，以及安息日、节日、甘心祭、还愿祭、平安祭、赎罪祭、赎愆祭、洁净的是哪种生物。若非每种动物代表和表示某种具体事物，情况决不会是这样。<br />但至于每一种的具体含义是什么，这在此解释起来过于冗长。只要知道动物表示属天之物，鸟类表示属灵之物，并且每种动物或鸟类都表示某种具体的属天或属灵之物就足够了。犹太教会本身，以及与其相关的一切事物都是诸如构成主国度的那类事物的代表。主的国度只有属天、属灵之物，即只有属于爱和信之物。这也可从前面有关洁净、有益动物含义的解读清楚看出来（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>节）。由于在上古教会，这些动物表属天的良善，所以在后来的教会中，当纯粹的外在敬拜，尽管也具有代表性，却被过分推崇并肯定时，这些动物就沦为代表物。<br />由于此处论述的主题是教会的状态，并预言了其未来的状态，故这一切藉着与此处记载得一模一样的代表物向亚伯兰说明了。然而，就内义而言，所表示的那类事物与此截然不同，这是谁都能知道并想到的。因为若非每一个事物都具有灵义，那么“取一头三岁的母牛犊，一只三岁的母山羊，一只三岁的公绵羊，一只斑鸠和一只雏鸽”，还将每样从中间劈成两半，并且一半对着另一半摆列，又有什么必要呢？不过，从下文清楚可知这些细节的含义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1823.</strong> Take a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old she-goat, and a three-year-old ram, means items that serve to represent the heavenly aspects of religion. This can be seen from the animals' symbolism in sacrifices.<br />No sound-thinking person can believe that the different species of animals sacrificed had significance only as sacrifices — that an adult ox and young ox (or calf) symbolized the same thing as a sheep, kid, or she-goat; that these had the same meaning as a lamb; or that a turtledove and pigeon chicks meant the same. The truth is that each animal had its own particular symbolism. As evidence, consider the fact that one kind was never offered in place of another. It was specified which were to be used in burnt offerings, daily sacrifices, and Sabbath and festival sacrifices; in freewill offerings, vows, and thanksgiving; in atonement for guilt and sin; and in purification.{*1} This would never have been done if something particular had not been represented and symbolized by each animal.<br />[2] It would take too long, though, to detail here what each kind symbolizes. It is enough to know here that heavenly traits are what animals symbolize, spiritual traits are what birds symbolize, and each species symbolizes some specific heavenly or spiritual trait. Religion itself, and everything involved in the Jewish religion, served to represent the kinds of things that exist in the Lord's kingdom, which contains only what is heavenly and spiritual. In other words, it contains only what relates to love and faith. This is also fairly clear from the symbolism of clean, useful animals, which are discussed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_714" target=_top>714</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_715" target=_top>715</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776" target=_top>776</a>.{*2} In the earliest churches they symbolized heavenly goodness, so later, when the church came to view and acknowledge worship as nothing more than a superficial act (and a representative one at that), they were turned into representations.{*3} [3] Because the subject of the current verse is the state of religion, including a prediction of its future character, this was presented to Abram's view by use of the same kinds of representations. It took place exactly as described here, and yet it symbolizes these things on an inner level. Anyone can see and consider the truth of this. What use would there be in taking a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a chick, dividing them into two pieces, and positioning them just so, if each and every aspect of it were not significant? What that significance is can be seen in the following sections.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The sacrificial laws to which Swedenborg here refers appear throughout Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The animals to be sacrificed are precisely detailed in each case, as he observes, and substitutions are apparently made only within the specified groups. [LHC, RS]<br />{*2} "Clean" here means ritually clean. Clean animals are discussed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719" target=_top>719</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_922" target=_top>922:1</a> in addition to the passages cited here. [LHC]<br />{*3} For more on this subject, see Swedenborg's discussion in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361" target=_top>1361</a> concerning the shift from symbolism to representation.

Take a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years. That this signifies the representatives of the celestial things of the church, is evident from the signification 
of the same animals in the sacrifices. No one who thinks sanely can believe that the various animals which were sacrificed signified nothing but sacrifices; or that an ox and a bullock or a calf signified 
the same as a sheep, a kid, and a she-goat, and these the same as a lamb; and that a turtledove signified the same as young pigeons; the fact being that every animal had its own special signification. 
This may be sufficiently evident from the fact that in no case was one offered instead of another; and that those are expressly named which were to be used in the daily burnt-offerings and sacrifices, 
those on the Sabbaths and festivals, those used in free-will offerings, vows, and peace-offerings, those in expiation of guilt and sin, and those in purifications; which would never have been 
so unless something special had been represented and signified by each animal.  [2] But what was signified by each particular kind would be too tedious to explain here; it is sufficient to know now that 
celestial things were signified by the animals, and spiritual things by the birds; and by each kind, some special celestial or spiritual thing. The Jewish Church itself, and all things relating to 
it, were representative of such things as are of the Lord's kingdom, where there is nothing but what is celestial and spiritual, that is, nothing but what is of love and of faith; as may also be sufficiently 
evident from the signification of the clean and useful beasts, explained above (n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 776). As in the Most Ancient Churches these were significative of heavenly 
goods, they afterwards became representative in the church, when worship merely external, which was also representative, was valued and acknowledged.  [3] As the state of the church is here treated of, 
and it is foretold what that state is to be, this was shown to Abram by similar representatives, exactly as is here related; but still such things are signified in the internal sense, as indeed everyone 
may know and think; for what would be the need of taking a heifer three years old, a she-goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon, of dividing them into two 
parts, and placing them so, unless everything had been significative? But what these things signified may be seen from what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1823</b></p><p><b>1823.</b>
'Take a three year old heifer, and a three year old she-goat, and a three year old ram' means things that are the representatives of the celestial things of the Church. This is clear from the meaning 
of these same animals in sacrifices. Nobody in his right mind can believe that the various animals that used to be sacrificed meant nothing but sacrifices, or that an ox and a young bull or a calf had 
the same meaning as a sheep, kid, and she-goat, and these the same as a lamb, and that a turtle dove and fledgling pigeons had similar meanings; for in fact each creature had its own specific meaning. 
This becomes quite clear from the fact that under no circumstances was one kind of animal offered instead of another, and from the fact that it was explicitly stated which creatures were to be used 
in the daily burnt- offerings and sacrifices, and which on the sabbath and at festivals; which creatures were to be used in free-will, votive, and communion offerings; which ones were to be used in expiations 
of guilt and sin; and which in purifications. This would never have been the case if some specific thing had not been represented and meant by each animal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But as to the specific meaning 
of each kind, this would take too long to explain here. Here it is enough if one knows that celestial things are meant by the animals and spiritual things by the birds, and that some specific celestial 
or spiritual thing is meant by each kind of animal or bird. The Church itself, and everything to do with the Jewish Church, was representative of such things as constitute the Lord's kingdom, where 
nothing but that which is celestial or spiritual exists, that is, nothing but that which belongs to love and faith, as also becomes quite clear from the meaning of clean and useful beasts, dealt with 
in <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>. And because in the Most Ancient Churches beasts meant celestial goods, in the Church existing at a later time when purely external, though representative, 
worship was highly esteemed and approved of, those beasts became representatives. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because the state of the Church is the subject here and because the nature of its state in the future is foretold, 
Abram was shown the same visually by means of similar representatives, exactly as recorded here. Yet quite apart from this, such things are nevertheless meant in the internal sense, as anyone may 
know and contemplate. For what would have been the need to take a three year old heifer, a three year old she-goat, a three year old ram, a turtle dove and a fledgling, and to divide them in two parts 
and to lay them out so, unless each single thing had carried a spiritual meaning? But what these details mean becomes clear from what follows below. </p>

'Accipe vitulam triennem, et capram triennem, et arietem triennem': quod significet illa quae repraesentativa sunt caelestium Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione eorundem in sacrificiis: nemo qui sane 
cogitat, potest credere quod diversa animalia quae sacrificabantur, nihil aliud significarent quam sacrificia, aut quod bos et juvencus aut vitulus, simile ac ovis, haedus, capra, et haec idem ac 
agnus, et quod simile turtur et pulli columbarum, cum tamen unumquodvis animal suam specialem significationem habuit; quod constare satis potest ex eo quod nusquam unum oblatum sit pro altero, et quod 
expresse nominata sint quae in holocaustis et sacrificiis quotidianis, sabbatorum et festorum, quae in voluntariis, votivis e eucharisticis, quae in expiatoriis reatus et peccati, quae in purificatoriis, 
essent; quod nusquam fuisset nisi speciale quid per unumquodvis animal repraesentatum et significatum fuisset; [2] quid autem significet unumquodvis in specie, nimis prolixum foret hic exponere; 
satis est scire hic quod caelestia sint quae per 'animalia' significantur, et quod spiritualia per 'aves,' et quod per unumquodvis aliquid speciale caeleste et spirituale; ipsa Ecclesia et omnia Ecclesiae 
Judaicae fuerunt repraesentativa talium quae sunt regni Domini, ubi nihil nisi caeleste et spirituale est, hoc est, nihil nisi quam quod amoris et fidei, ut satis quoque constare potest a significatione 
bestiarum mundarum et utilium, de quibus n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 776, quae quia in Antiquissimis Ecclesiis caelestia bona significabant, postea in Ecclesia cum cultus modo externus 
et is repraesentativus aestimabatur et agnoscebatur, repraesentativa facta sunt.  [3] Quia hic de statu Ecclesiae agitur, et praedicitur qualis futurus, ostensum est per similia repraesentativa coram 
Abramo, prorsus ut hic memoratur, sed usque in sensu interno significantur talia; quod quisque potest scire et cogitare; quid enim opus foret vitulam triennem, capram triennem, arietem triennem, turturem 
et pullum sumere, in binas partes illa dividere, et ita ponere, nisi omnia et singula significativa fuissent? quid autem significant, constare potest a sequentibus. </p>
