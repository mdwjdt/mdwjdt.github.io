<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8672节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8672.</strong>“叶忒罗因耶和华向以色列所行的一切美事，便甚喜乐”表当一切顺利时，神性良善的状态。这从“叶忒罗”的代表和“因一切美事甚欢喜”的含义清楚可知：“叶忒罗”是指神性良善（参看<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>节）；“因一切美事甚喜乐”当论及“叶忒罗”所代表的神性良善时，是指该良善的状态。当向天堂和那里的天使，以及教会和那里的世人行良善时，在圣言中，神性的状态就用“喜乐”来表达。然而，这种喜乐的性质超出一切理解，因为它属于无限者。当良善被那些在天堂和教会里的人接受时，无限喜乐也是存在的，这一点从神性之爱可以看出来，神性之爱对于人类是无限的（<a href="8644.htm">8644</a>节），因为一切喜乐皆是爱的一个特征。由此明显可知，“叶忒罗因耶和华向以色列所行的一切美事，便甚喜乐”表示当一切顺利时，神性良善的状态；因为“以色列”表示那些属于主的属灵国度和属灵教会的人（<a href="8669.htm">8669</a>节）；他们一切顺利，因为他们已从侵扰当中得以释放，后来在试探中获胜，如前所述。</p>

And Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done to Israel. That this signifies the state of Divine good when all things succeed, is evident from the representation of Jethro, as being Divine 
good (see above n. 8643); from the signification of "rejoicing over all the good," when predicated of the Divine good which is represented by Jethro, as being the state of this good; for the state 
of the Divine when good is done to heaven and the angels there, and also to the church and the man there, is expressed in the Word by "joy," but the quality of this joy is beyond comprehension, because 
it belongs to the Infinite. That there is also infinite joy on account of the reception of good by those who are in heaven and the church, can be seen from the Divine love, which is infinite toward 
the human race (n. 8644), for all joy is of love. From all this it is evident that by "Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done to Israel," is signified the state of the Divine good when 
all things succeed; for by "Israel" are meant those who were of the Lord's spiritual kingdom and spiritual church (n. 8669), with whom all things had succeeded, because they had been liberated from 
infestations, and afterward had conquered in temptations, as has been above described. </p>

'And Jethro rejoiced over all the good which Jehovah had done for Israel' means the state of Divine Good when all things go well. This is clear from the representation of 'Jethro' as Divine Good, dealt 
with above in <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>; and from the meaning of 'rejoiced over all the good' - when used in reference to Divine Good, represented by 'Jethro' - as the state of that Good. The state of Divine Good when 
good is done to heaven and the angels there, also to the Church and the people there, is expressed in the Word as 'joy'. The nature of the joy however surpasses all understanding, because it is that of 
the Infinite. Infinite joy also exists when good is received by those in heaven and in the Church, as may be recognized from Divine Love, which is infinite towards the human race, <a href="8644.htm">8644</a>; for all joy 
is a characteristic of love. From all this it is evident that 'Jethro rejoiced over all the good which Jehovah had done for Israel' means the state of Divine Good when all things go well. 'Israel' is 
used to mean those belonging to the Lord's spiritual kingdom and spiritual Church, <a href="8669.htm">8669</a>, with whom all things went well; for they were delivered from molestations, and were after that victorious in temptations, 
as has been described above. </p>

</p><b>8672.</b>
`Et gavisus est Jethro super omni bono quod fecit Jehovah Israeli': quod significet statum Divini Boni cum succedunt omnia, constat ex repraesentatione `Jethronis' quod sit Divinum Bonum, de qua supra 
n. 8643; ex significatione `gavisus super omni bono' cum praedicatur de Divino Bono, quod per `Jethronem' repraesentatur, quod sit status illius Boni; nam status Divini Boni, cum bonum fit caelo ac 
angelis ibi, tum Ecclesiae (c)ac homini ibi, in Verbo exprimitur per `gaudium,' sed quale istius gaudii est incomprehensibile, quia est Infiniti; quod etiam gaudium infinitum sit propter receptionem 
boni ab illis qui in caelo et in Ecclesia, constare potest ex Divino Amore, qui erga genus humanum est infinitus, n. 8644, nam omne gaudium est amoris; ex his patet quod per `gavisus est Jethro super 
omni bono quod fecit Jehovah Israeli' significetur status Divini Boni cum succedunt omnia; per `Israelem' enim intelliguntur illi qui e regno spirituali et Ecclesia spirituali Domini {1}, n. 8669, cum 
quibus (t)omnia successerunt, nam liberati sunt ab infestationibus, ac postea vicerunt in tentationibus, ut supra descriptum est. 	@1 i sunt$ </p>
