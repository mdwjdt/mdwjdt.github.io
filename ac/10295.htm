<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10295节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10295</strong>.“这馨香的香料”表源于属灵良善的情感。这从“馨香的香料”的含义清楚可知，“馨香的香料”是指对源于良善的真理的情感，如前所示（<a href="10291.htm">10291</a>节），它们源于属灵的良善（参看<a href="10254.htm">10254</a>，<a href="10290.htm">10290</a>，<a href="10293.htm">10293</a>e节）。香之所以用表示源于属灵良善的真理的香料来制备，或也可说，用这些香料所表示的、属于属灵类别的真理来制备，是因为“香”表示通过源于“香”所表示的良善的真理而实现的对神的敬拜。事实上，“香”尤表感恩、崇拜、祷告等行为（<a href="9475.htm">9475</a>节）。这类敬拜行为发自内心，通过思维和言语来表达。这种敬拜通过属灵真理来实现，这一点从一个人在进行这种敬拜时出现在脑海里的观念可以看出来。因为这时，此人的观念从他的记忆进入他的理解力，并从理解力中出来；凡从那里发出的东西都被称为属灵的。至于源于属天良善的对神的敬拜，就是诸如发生在那些在主的属天国度之人当中的那种，这种敬拜不是通过感恩、崇拜和祷告实现的，不像在那些在属灵国度之人当中的敬拜，因而不是通过来自记忆的真理，而是通过来自内心的真理实现的，来自内心的真理与支配这些人的爱本身行如一体。因为与他们同在的真理已经铭刻在他们的爱上，故当被爱感动去做所吩咐的事时，他们同时被真理感动去如此行，不会出于教义思想这些真理，因而不用把它们从记忆中召唤出来。那些在主的属天国度之人的状态就是这样，这一点从前面关于属天国度和属灵国度的说明可以看出来（<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节提到的地方）。“香”表示通过口而从内心的思维发出的感恩、崇拜和祷告（参看<a href="9475.htm">9475</a>，<a href="10177.htm">10177</a>，<a href="10198.htm">10198</a>节）。</p>

Things fragrant. That this signifies affections from spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "fragrant spices," as being the affections of truth from good (shown above, n. 10291); (that 
they are from spiritual good, see n. 10254, 10290, 10293). The reason why the incense was prepared from spices, which signify truths from spiritual good; or what is the same, why the truths which are 
signified by these spices belong to the spiritual class, is that by "incense" is signified Divine worship which is performed by means of truths from this good, for it is confessions, adorations, prayers, 
and other similar things, which are specifically signified by "incense" (n. 9475); and such things come forth from the heart by means of the thoughts and the speech. That this worship is performed 
by means of spiritual truths, can be seen from the ideas in which a man is when in this worship, for the ideas in which a man then is are from his memory, and consequently from the understanding; and 
the things which proceed from this source are called spiritual. But as regards Divine worship from celestial good, such as is with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, this is not performed 
by means of confessions, adorations, and prayers of the same quality as exist with those who are in the spiritual kingdom; thus not by means of truths from the memory, but by means of truths from the 
heart, which make one with the love itself in which they are; for the truths with these are inscribed on their love. When therefore they do from love what is commanded, they do it at the same time from 
truths, without any thought about these from doctrine, thus without calling them forth from the memory. (That such is the state of those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom can be seen from what 
was shown concerning this kingdom and the spiritual kingdom in the passages cited in n. 9277.) (That "incense" signifies confessions, adorations, and prayers which proceed through the mouth from the 
thought, see n. 9475, 10177, 10198.) </p>

'[These] sweet ones' means affections springing from spiritual good. This is clear from the meaning of 'sweet-smelling spices' as affections for truth springing from good, dealt with above in <a href="10291.htm">10291</a>. 
As regards their springing from spiritual good, see <a href="10254.htm">10254</a>, <a href="10290.htm">10290</a>, <a href="10293.htm">10293</a>(end). The reason why the incense was made from the spices that mean kinds of truth springing from spiritual good, or what amounts 
to the same thing, why the kinds of truth that are meant by those spices belong to the spiritual group, is that the worship of God accomplished by means of truths springing from that good is meant by 
'incense'. For acts of thanksgiving, adoration, prayer, and the like are what are meant specifically by 'incense', see <a href="9475.htm">9475</a>. Such acts of worship are emanations from the heart expressed through thoughts 
and speech. The fact that spiritual truths are the means by which such worship is accomplished may be recognized from the ideas a person has in mind while engaged in that worship. For the person's 
ideas then pass from his memory into his understanding and come forth from there; and anything emanating from there is called spiritual. As regards the worship of God springing from celestial good, 
such as takes place among those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, this is not accomplished by means of acts of thanksgiving, adoration, and prayer, as is the worship among those who are in the 
spiritual kingdom, thus not by truths coming from the memory but by truths coming from the heart, which act as one with the actual love that governs those people. For the truths that exist with them have 
been inscribed on their love, and therefore when moved by love to do what is commanded they are at the same time moved to do so by truths, without any thought about them based on what they have been 
taught, thus without any recollection of them from their memory. The fact that the state of those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom is such as this may be recognized from what has been shown 
regarding that kingdom and the spiritual kingdom in the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>. As regards 'incense', that it means acts of thanksgiving, adoration, and prayer, which emanate from the thoughts of 
the heart through the mouth, see <a href="9475.htm">9475</a>, <a href="10177.htm">10177</a>, <a href="10198.htm">10198</a>.  </p>

`Fragrantia': quod significet affectiones ex bono spirituali, constat ex significatione `aromatum fragrantium' quod sint affectiones veri ex bono, de qua supra n. 10,291, quod ex bono spirituali, videatur 
n. 10,254, 10,290, 10,293 fin. Quod suffimentum confectum fuerit ex aromatibus, quae significant vera ex bono spirituali, seu quod idem, quod vera quae per aromata illa significantur pertineant 
ad classem spiritualem, est causa quia per `suffimentum' significatur cultus Divinus qui fit per vera ex illo bono, {1}sunt enim confessiones, adorationes, preces, et similia, {2}quae in specie per `suffimentum' 
significantur, videatur n. 9475; talia exeunt ex corde per cogitationes et per loquelam; quod hic cultus fiat per vera spiritualia, constare potest ex ideis in quibus homo est cum in illo 
cultu, ideae enim in quibus homo tunc, {3}sunt ex memoria ejus, et inde ex intellectuali, et quae inde procedunt, spirituali vocantur. Quod autem cultum Divinum ex bono caelesti, qualis est apud illos 
qui in regno caelesti Domini sunt, attinet, ille non fit per confessiones, adorationes, et preces, {4}qualiter apud illos qui in regno spirituali sunt, ita non per vera ex memoria sed per vera ex corde, 
quae unum agunt cum ipso amore in quo sunt; sunt enim vera apud illos inscripta amori illorum, quapropter cum ex amore faciunt praecepta, simul ex veris faciunt, absque cogitatione de illis ex doctrinali, 
ita absque evocatione illorum ex memoria. Quod talis status illorum sit qui in (t)regno caelesti Domini sunt, constare potest ex illis quae de illo regno et de regno spirituali in locis citatis 
n. 9277 ostensa sunt. Quod `suffimentum' significet confessiones, adorationes, et preces, quae per os procedunt ex cogitatione cordis, videatur n. 9475, 10,177, 10,198. @1 per cultum Divinum hic
