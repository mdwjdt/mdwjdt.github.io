The Word teaches that man lives after death, as where it is said that "God is not the God of the dead but of the living" (Matt 22:32); that after death Lazarus was taken up into heaven, but the rich 
man was cast into hell (Luke 16:22, 23); that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are there (Matt. 8:11; 22:32; Luke 16:23-25, 29); that Jesus said to the thief, "This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise" (Luke 
23:43); and in other places.            EXODUS 34 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stones like the former ones, and I will write upon the tables the words that were 
upon the former tables, which thou brakest.      2. And be thou ready against the morning, and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai, and stand for Me there on the head of the mountain.      3. And 
no man shall come up with thee, and moreover no man shall be seen in all the mountain; and no flock or herd shall feed over against this mountain.      4. And he hewed two tables of stones like the 
former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto Mount Sinai, as Jehovah commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stones.      5. And Jehovah descended in the cloud, 
and stood with him there, and called on the name of Jehovah.      6. And Jehovah passed by over his faces, and called, Jehovah, Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering with angers, and 
great in goodness and in truth.      7. Keeping goodness unto thousands, bearing iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and in absolving will not absolve; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
sons, and upon the sons' sons, upon the thirds and upon the fourths.      8. And Moses made haste, and bowed himself to the earth, and adored.      9. And he said, If, I pray, I have found grace in 
Thine eyes O Lord, let the Lord, I pray, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and be propitious unto our iniquity and unto our sin, and make us Thine inheritance.      10. And he said, 
Behold I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do wonderful things, such as have not been created in all the earth, and in all nations; and all the people in the midst of whom thou art shall 
see the work of Jehovah, because this is a wonderful thing that I do with thee.      11. Keep thou that which I command thee this day; behold, I drive out from thy faces the Amorite, and the Canaanite, 
and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.      12. Take heed to thyself, lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou comest, 
lest perchance it become a snare in the midst of thee.      13. Wherefore ye shall overturn their altars, and shall break their pillars, and shall cut down their groves.      14. Wherefore thou shalt 
not bow thyself to another god; for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, a jealous God is He.      15. Lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land, and they commit whoredom after 
their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice.      16. And thou take of his daughters for thy sons, and his daughters commit whoredom after their gods, 
and make thy sons commit whoredom after their gods.      17. Thou shalt not make for thee molten gods.      18. The feast of unleavened things shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things, 
as I commanded thee, at the time appointed of the month Abib; because in the month Abib thou wentest forth from Egypt.      19. Everything that openeth the womb is Mine; and of all thy cattle 
thou shalt give the male, that openeth of ox and of small cattle.      20. And that which openeth of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, thou shalt break its neck. Every 
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And My faces shall not be seen empty.      21. Six days thou shalt work, and on the seventh day thou shall rest; in plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest.  
    22. And the feast of weeks thou shalt make to thee of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the revolving of the year.      23. Three times in the year shall every 
male of thine be seen before the faces of the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.      24. Because I drive out nations from thy faces, and I will enlarge thy border; and no one shall covet thy land, when 
thou goest up to see the faces of Jehovah thy God three times in the year.      25. Thou shalt not slay the blood of My sacrifice upon what is leavened; and the sacrifice of the feast of the passover 
shall not stay all night unto the morning.      26. The firstfruits of the first things of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's 
milk.      27. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write for thee these words; because upon the mouth of these words I make a covenant with thee and with Israel.      28. And he was there with Jehovah 
forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.      29. And it was, as Moses went down from Mount 
Sinai, and the two tables of the Testimony in Moses' hand, as he went down from the mountain, that Moses knew not that the skin of his faces shone when he spoke with Him.      30. And Aaron and all 
the sons of Israel saw Moses, and behold the skin of his faces shone; and they feared to come near unto him.      31. And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the princes in the assemblage returned 
unto him; and Moses spoke unto them.      32. And afterward all the sons of Israel came near; and he commanded them all things that Jehovah bad spoken with him in Mount Sinai.      33. And Moses 
left off from speaking with them, and he put a veil upon his faces.      34. And when Moses entered in before Jehovah to speak with Him, he removed the veil until he went out; and he went out, and 
spoke unto the sons of Israel that which was commanded.      35. And the sons of Israel saw the faces of Moses, that the skin of Moses' faces shone; and Moses drew back the veil upon his faces until 
he entered in to speak with Him. </p>

sons, on the third and on the fourth [generations].  <LI value='8'> And Moses made haste and bowed to the earth, and adored.  <LI value='9'> And he said, If now I have found grace in Your eyes, O Lord, let [my] Lord, I beg You, 
go in our midst, for they are a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, and make us Your inheritance.  <LI value='10'> And He said, Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people

 <LI value='12'> Take care, lest by chance you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land onto which you come, lest by chance it become a snare in your midst.  <LI value='13'> Therefore you shall overthrow their

he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face gleamed while he talked to Him.  <LI value='30'> And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his 
face gleamed; and they were afraid to approach him.  <LI value='31'> And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the princes in the assembly turned back to him, and Moses talked to them.  <LI value='32'> And afterwards all the 
children of Israel approached, and he commanded them all the things that Jehovah had told him on Mount Sinai.  <LI value='33'> And Moses finished talking to them, and he put a veil over his face.  <LI value='34'> And whenever 
Moses went in before Jehovah to talk to Him he took the veil off until he was going to come out; and he came out and told the children of Israel what had been commanded.  <LI value='35'> And the children of 
Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face was gleaming, and Moses drew the veil back over his face, until he went in to talk to Him.

<p>1.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Dola tibi duas tabulas lapidum secundum priores, et scribam super {1}tabulis verba quae fuerunt super tabulis 
prioribus quas fregisti. @1 Tabulas IT$ 2.  Et esto paratus ad mane, et ascendes in matutino ad montem Sinai, et consistes Mihi ibi super capite montis. 3.  Et quisquam non ascendet tecum, et etiam 
quisquam nec videbitur in toto monte; etiam grex et armentum nec pascent e regione montis hujus. 4.  Et dolavit duas tabulas lapidum secundum priores, et surrexit mane Moscheh in matutino, et ascendit 
ad montem Sinai, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH illi, et accepit in manu sua duas tabulas lapidum. 5.  Et descendit JEHOVAH in nube, et constitit cum eo ibi, et invocavit nomen JEHOVAE. 6.  Et 
transivit JEHOVAH super facies ejus, et invocavit, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH, DEUS misericors et gratiosus, longanimis iras, et magnus bonitate et veritate. 7.  Servans bonitatem ad milia, ferens iniquitatem 
et praevaricationem et peccatum, et absolvendo non absolvit; visitans iniquitatem patrum super filios et super filios filiorum, super tertios et super quartos. 8.  Et festinavit Moscheh, et inflexit 
se ad terram, et adoravit. 9.  Et dixit, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis Tuis, DOMINE, eat quaeso DOMINUS in medio nostri, quia populus durus cervice ille, et propitius sis ad iniquitatem nostram 
et ad peccatum nostrum, et hereditatem Tuam facias nos. 10.  Et dixit, Ecce Ego pangens foedus, coram omni populo tuo faciam mirabilia, quae non creata sunt in omni terra, et in omnibus gentibus, et 
videbit omnis populus, cujus tu in medio ejus, opus JEHOVAE, quod mirabile hoc quod Ego faciens cum te. 11.  Custodi tibi id quod Ego praecipio tibi hodie; ecce Ego expellens a faciebus tuis Emorritam, 
et Canaanitam, et Chittitam, et Perisitam, et Chivitam, et Jebusitam. 12.  Cave tibi ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae super quam tu venis, ne forte fiat in laqueum in medio tui. 13.  Quare 
altaria eorum evertetis, et statuas eorum frangetis, et lucos ejus exscindetis. 14.  Quare non incurvabis te deo alteri, nam JEHOVAH Zelotes nomen Ipsius, DEUS Zelotes Ille. 15.  Ne forte pangas foedus 
habitatori terrae, et scortentur post deos eorum, et sacrificent diis eorum, et vocet te, et comedas de sacrificio ejus. 16.  Et accipias de filiabus ejus filiis tuis, et scortentur filiae ejus 
post deos earum, et scortari faciant filios tuos post deos earum. 17.  Deos fusilis non facies tibi. 18.  Festum azymorum custodies; septem diebus comedes azyma quae praecepi tibi, ad statum tempus 
mensis Abib, quia in mense Abib exivisti ex Aegypto. 19.  Omnis apertura uteri Mihi, [et] ex omni pecore tuo des masculum, aperturam bovis et pecudis. 20.  Et aperturam asini redimes in pecude, et 
si non redemeris decollabis illam; omnem primogenitum filiorum tuorum redimes; et non videbuntur facies Meae {1}vacue. @1 vacuae IT$ 21.  Sex diebus operaberis, et in die septimo quiesces, in aratione 
et in messatione quiesces. 22.  Et festum septimanarum facies tibi primitiarum messis tritici, et festum collectionis revolutionis anni. 23.  Tribus vicibus in anno videbitur omnis masculus tuus 
ad facies DOMINI JEHOVAE DEI Israelis. 24.  Quia expello gentes a faciebus tuis, et dilatari faciam terminum tuum, et non concupiscet quisquam terram tuam in ascendendo te ad videndum facies JEHOVAE 
DEI tui tribus vicibus in anno. 25.  Non mactabis super fermentato sanguinem sacrificii Mei, et non pernoctabit ad mane sacrificium festi Paesach. 26.  Primitias primitivorum humi tuae inducas domum 
JEHOVAE DEI tui.  Non elixabis haedum in lacte matris suae. 27.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Scribe tibi verba illa, quia super ore verborum illorum pango cum te foedus, et cum Israele. 28.  Et fuit 
ibi cum JEHOVAH quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes; panem non edit et aquam non bibit; et scripsit super tabulis verba foederis, decem verba. 29.  Et fuit in descendendo (x) Moscheh de monte Sinai, 
et duae tabulae testimonii in manu Moschis in descendendo illo de monte, et Moscheh non novit quod (x)coruscaret cutis facierum ejus in loquendo illo cum Ipso. 30. {1}  Et vidit Aharon et omnes 
filii Israelis Moschen, et ecce coruscavit cutis facierum ejus, et timebant ab accedere ad illum. @1 See p. ix preliminary note 1. A begins here.$ 31.  Et vocavit ad illos Moscheh, et reversi sunt 
ad illum Aharon, et omnes principes in (x)coetu, et locutus Moscheh ad illos. 32.  Et postea accesserunt omnes filii Israelis, et praecepit illis omnia quae locutus JEHOVAH cum illo in monte Sinai. 33. 
{1}  Et absolvit Moscheh a loquendo cum illis, et dedit super facies suas velamen. @1 Es. xxv 7 written in m$ 34.  Et in intrando Mosche coram JEHOVAH ad loquendum cum Ipso, removit velamen usque 
ad exire illum; et exivit et locutus ad filios Israelis id quod praeceptum est. 35.  Et viderunt filii Israelis facies Moschis, quod (x)coruscaret cutis facierum Moschis, et reduxit Moscheh velamen 
super facies suas usque ad intrare illum ad loquendum cum Ipso. </p>
