<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第109节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>109.</strong>如前面所说，智慧和聪明虽看似属于人，实际却属于主，这在以西结书中以类似的象征作了明确的宣告：“他带我回到殿门，见殿的门槛下有水往东流出（原来殿面朝东）……他对我说，这水往东方流去，必下到亚拉巴，直到海。所发出来的水必流入盐海，使水得医治。这河水所到之处，凡滋生的动物都必生活……在河这边与那边的岸上必生长各类的树木，其果可作食物，叶子不枯干，果子不断绝，每月必结新果子，因为这水是从圣所流出来的。树上的果子必作食物，叶子乃为治病。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.1.htm">47:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.12.htm">12</a>）在此，“东方”象征主，水与河的源头“圣所”也象征主。<br />又如：“天使又指示我在城内街道当中一道生命水的河，明亮如水晶，从神和羔羊的宝座流出来。在河这边与那边有生命树，结十二样果子，每月都结果子。树上的叶子乃为医治万民。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.1.htm">22:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.2.htm">2</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]109.</strong> Although wisdom and understanding seem to reside in us, they belong to the Lord alone, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_109/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_99" target=_top>99</a>], and this is clearly expressed in Ezekiel under representative images of the same kind:<br />There! Water going out under the doorsill of the House toward the east, because the House faces east. And he said, "That water is going out to the boundary toward the east, and it runs down onto the plain and goes to the sea, having been channeled out into the sea, and the water [of the sea] will be cured. And it will come about that every living soul that creeps in any place where the water of the rivers goes will survive. And beside the river, on its bank, on this side and that, will grow every food tree. Its branch will not wither, and its fruit will not be used up. Month by month it is reborn, because its water comes out from the sanctuary. And its fruit therefore will serve as food, and its leaf as medicine." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_109/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_1" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_109/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_8-9" target=_top>8-9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_109/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_12" target=_top>12</a>)<br />In this instance the east symbolizes the Lord, as does the sanctuary from which spring the water and rivers. Likewise in John:<br />He showed me a pure river of the water of life, brilliant as crystal, going out from the throne of God and the Lamb. In the middle of its street and of the river, on this side and that, was the tree of life, making twelve fruits, offering up its fruit each month; and the leaf of the tree served as medicine for the nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_109/bible_king-james-version_revelation_22_1-2" target=_top>Revelation 22:1-2</a>) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 109</b></p><p><b>109.</b>
That although wisdom and intelligence appear in man, they are, as has been said, of the Lord alone, is plainly declared in Ezekiel by means of similar representatives: </p>
<p>     Behold, waters issued out 
from under the threshold of the house eastward; for the face of the house is the east; and he said, These waters issue out to the border toward the east, and go down into the plain, and come to the sea, 
which being led into the sea, the waters shall be healed; and it shall come to pass that every living soul which creepeth, whithersoever the water of the rivers shall come, shall live. And by the 
river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, there come up all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed; it is born again in its months, because 
these its waters issue out of the sanctuary, and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine (Ezek. 47:1, 8-9, 12). Here the Lord is signified by the "east" and by the 
"sanctuary" whence the waters and rivers issued. In like manner in John: </p>
<p>     He showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In 
the midst of the street thereof, and of the river on this side and that, was the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner of] fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; and the leaf of the tree was for 
the healing of the nations (Rev. 22:1-2). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 109</b></p><p><b>109.</b>
That for all their appearance in man wisdom and intelligence belong, as has been said, to the Lord alone is plainly stated by means of similar representatives in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, waters were issuing 
from below the threshold of the House towards the east, for the House faced eastwards. And He said, These waters are issuing out to the boundary towards the east; and they go down over the plain and 
come to the sea. Having been brought into the sea, the waters will be healed. And it will happen that every living creature<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that creeps, even to everything to which the water of the rivers comes, 
will live. And beside the river there will rise up upon its bank, on this side and on that, every tree for food. Its leaf<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will not wither, and its fruit will not fail; it is reborn monthly, for these 
its waters flow out from the Sanctuary, and its fruits will be for food and its leaf for medicine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:1,%208,%209,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:1, 8, 9, 12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Lord is meant by 'the east' and also by 'the Sanctuary from which 
waters and rivers flowed forth'. Similarly in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He showed me a pure river of the water of life, bright as crystal,flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the middle of its street, 
and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaf of the tree was for the healing of the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2022:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 22:1, 2</a>.

Quod sapientia et intelligentia tametsi apparent in homine, sint {1} solius Domini, sicut dictum, dicitur clare per similia repraesentativa apud Ezechielem, 	Ecce aquae exeuntes sub limine domus versus 
orientem, quia facies domus, oriens;...et dixit, Aquae illae exeuntes ad terminum versus orientem, et descendunt super planitiem, et veniunt ad mare, in mare eductae, et sanabuntur aquae; et fiet, 
omnis anima vivens, quae reptat, ad omne, quo venit aqua fluviorum, vivet....Et juxta fluvium ascendet super ripa ejus hinc et illinc omnis arbor cibi; non marcescet ramus ejus, et 	non consumetur fructus 
ejus, in menses suos renascitur; quia 	aquae ejus e sanctuario illae exeunt, et erunt inde fructus ejus in cibum, et folium ejus in medicinam, xlvii 1, 8, 9, 12; </p>
<p>hic Dominus significatur per 'oriens,' 
et per 'sanctuarium, e quo aquae et fluvii.' Similiter apud Johannem, 	Ostendit mihi purum fluvium aquae vitae, splendidum sicut crystallum, exeuntem e throno Dei et Agni: in medio plateae ejus, 
et fluvii, hinc et illinc arbor vitae, faciens fructus duodecim, juxta mensem quemvis reddens fructum suum, et folium arboris in medicinam gentium, Apoc. xxii 1, 2. @     1 sit 1.$ </p>
