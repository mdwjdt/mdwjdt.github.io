<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5851节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5851.</strong>与人同在的灵人并非始终是一样的，而是照此人的状态，也就是其情感的状态，或其爱和目的的状态而更换。之前的灵人被移除后，其他灵人便取而代之。一般来说，与人同在的是哪类灵人是由此人自己的品质决定的。若他贪婪，他们就是贪婪的灵人；若他傲慢，他们就是傲慢的灵人；若他渴望报复，他们就是具有这种性质的灵人；或若他具有欺骗性，他们就是具有欺骗性的灵人。人从地狱给自己召来与他的生活相匹配的灵人。地狱之间的区别是最为显着的，取决于他们所贪恋的邪恶，以及邪恶的一切差别。因此，类似他自己的灵人不可避免地被召唤出来，依附在一个陷入邪恶的人身上。</p>

The same spirits do not remain constantly with a man, but are changed according to the man's states, that is, the states of his affection, or of his loves and ends, the former being removed and others 
succeeding. In general there are with man spirits of such a quality as is the man himself. If he is avaricious, there are spirits who are avaricious; if he is haughty, there are haughty spirits; if 
he is desirous of revenge, there are spirits of this character; if he is deceitful, there are the like spirits. Man summons to himself spirits from hell in accordance with his life. The hells are most 
exactly distinguished according to evils of cupidities, and according to all the differences of evil. Thus there is never any lack of spirits like himself to be called out and adjoined to a man who is in evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5851</b></p><p><b>5851.</b>
The same spirits do not remain with a person permanently but are changed according to how the person's states undergo change - the states of his affection, that is, of his love and the ends he has in 
view. The spirits present at one time are removed and others take their place. In general what kinds of spirits are present with a person is determined by the character of the person himself. If he is 
avaricious, they are avaricious spirits; if he is haughty, they are haughty spirits; if he is vengeful, they are spirits with that kind of nature; or if he is given to deceit, they are spirits given 
to the same thing. A person attracts to himself spirits from hell who match his way of life. The hells are marked off from one another by the most precise distinctions, determined by the different evils 
that are the objects of their desires and by all the variations each evil can take. As a consequence spirits of a nature similar to his own are inevitably called forth and become attached to a person 
subject to evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5851</b>
</p><b>5851.</b>
Spiritus iidem non manent perpetuo apud hominem, sed secundum status hominis, nempe ejus affectionis seu amoris et finium, mutantur; priores removentur et alii succedunt; in genere tales spiritus apud 
hominem sunt qualis ipse homo est; si avarus est, sunt spiritus qui avari, si fastuosus, sunt spiritus qui fastuosi, si vindictae cupidus, sunt spiritus qui tales, si dolosus, sunt spiritus similes; 
homo sibi arcessit spiritus ex inferno secundum vitam.  Sunt inferna exactissime distincta secundum mala cupiditatum, et secundum omnes differentias mali; inde nusquam deest quin similes evocentur et 
adjungantur homini qui in malo. </p>
