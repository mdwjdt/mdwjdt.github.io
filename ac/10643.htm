<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10643节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10643</strong>.“打碎他们的柱子”表必须驱散邪恶的虚假。这从“柱子”的含义清楚可知，“柱子”是源于真理的对主的敬拜的代表（参看<a href="4580.htm">4580</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>，<a href="9388.htm">9388</a>-<a href="9389.htm">9389</a>节），在反面意义上是来自虚假的偶像崇拜的代表（<a href="3727.htm">3727</a>节）。“柱子”之所以是敬拜的代表，是因为古人习惯立起柱子，用油膏抹它们，由此使它们成为圣物。古人主要在大山、小山上和小树林里举行敬拜，他们在那里立柱。他们之所以在大山上举行敬拜、竖立柱子，是因为大山表示属天之爱，就是对主之爱掌权的天堂；。他们之所以在小山上举行敬拜、竖立柱子，是因为小山表示属灵之爱，就是对邻之爱掌权的天堂；他们之所以在小树林里举行敬拜、竖立柱子，是因为树林表示天上的智慧和聪明。所有这些事物都来源于对应关系。竖立在那些地方的柱子表示神性真理；因为柱子是石头，而“石头”表示真理。因此，就神性真理而言，主在圣言中被称为“以色列的石头”。正因如此，“柱子”表示源于真理的对主的敬拜。<br />但当存在于古人当中的教会的代表开始部分地沦为偶像崇拜，部分地沦为邪术时，这些东西就废除了，尤其在以色列民族当中废除了，这个民族心里是偶像崇拜者。这就是为何“柱子”也表示来自虚假的偶像崇拜。当人们只对外在事物感兴趣时，如当他们视自我和世界为目的，视教会的神性事物为手段时的情形，一切敬拜都是如此。这时，对那些仍进行敬拜的人来说，属于敬拜的一切事物都沦为偶像，因为受到敬拜的是没有内在事物的外在事物。因此，包含在敬拜和教义中的真理变成虚假，因为它们被进入它们的自我和世界的观念歪曲了，其它许多将属神之物从这些真理中夺走，把它们转到自我和世界那里的观念依附于这些观念。这一切也可从外邦民族的祭坛看出来；尽管他们在祭坛上献祭的方式与以色列民族一样，但这些祭物是可憎的。<br />古人习惯竖立柱子以表示敬拜的神圣，这一点从雅各所立的柱子清楚看出来；对此，我们在创世记中读到：<br />雅各拿当枕头所放的石头，立作柱子。他说，我若平平安安地回到我父亲的家，我所立为柱子的这石头必作神的家。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.18.htm">28:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.22.htm">22</a>）<br />这一点也可从摩西在西乃山上所立的十二根柱子看出来，对此，我们在出埃及记读到：<br />摩西将耶和华的一切话都写下来。清晨早早起来，在山下筑一座坛，按以色列十二支派，立十二根柱子。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.4.htm">24:4</a>；也可参看<a href="9389.htm">9389</a>节）<br />还有这些经文，以赛亚书：<br />当那日，在埃及地中间必有为耶和华筑的一座坛；在埃及的边界上必有为耶和华立的一根柱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.19.htm">19:19</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />以色列人也必坐多日，无君王、无首领、无祭祀、无柱子。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.4.htm">3:4</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“柱子”表示源于真理的敬拜，因为如前所述，“石头”表示神性真理，“用油膏抹的柱子”表示从神性良善发出的神性真理。<br />但当这些代表物开始以一种偶像崇拜的方式受到敬拜时，经上就吩咐要把它们推倒、打碎，如本节，以及出埃及记23:24和申命记7:5; 12:3。由于以色列民族心里是崇拜偶像的，所以为防止他们在大山和小山上，或小树林里立柱子，以一种偶像崇拜的方式敬拜它们，他们就被禁止立柱和种植小树林，尽管对古人来说，这些事物都是属于敬拜的圣物。这个民族被禁止这样做，这一点清楚可见于摩西五经，申命记：<br />你不可在你为自己所筑的耶和华你神的祭坛旁种植什么小树林。也不可为自己竖立柱子，这是耶和华你神所恨恶的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.21.htm">16:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.22.htm">22</a>）<br />他们被禁止如此行，因为他们以一种偶像崇拜的方式敬拜这些事物，这一点清楚可见于下列经文，列王纪上：<br />犹大人行耶和华眼中为恶的事；他们在各高冈上，各青翠树下为自己筑高地和祭坛。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上14.22.htm">14:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上14.23.htm">23</a>）<br />列王纪下17:10中有同样的话论到以色列人。弥迦书：<br />我必从你中间砍掉你的雕像和柱子，你就不再崇拜自己手所造的。我必从你中间把小树林连根拔除。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.13.htm">5:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.14.htm">14</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们在各青翠树下的诸神当中欲火攻心。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.5.htm">57:5</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />尼布甲尼撒必用他的马蹄践踏你一切的街道，用剑杀戮你的人民，使你坚固的柱子倒在地上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.11.htm">26:11</a>）<br />此外还有其它地方。从这些经文也明显可知“柱子”在内义上表示什么。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10643</b></p><p><b>10643.</b>
And ye shall break their pillars. That this signifies that the falsities of evil must be dispersed, is evident from the signification of "pillars," as being representatives of the worship of the Lord 
from truths (see n. 4580, 4582, 9388-9389), and in the opposite sense representatives of idolatrous worship from falsities. The reason why "pillars" were representative of worship, was that it was in 
use among the ancients to set up pillars and anoint them with oil and thus sanctify them. The ancients held their worship chiefly upon mountains, upon hills, and in groves, and there they set up pillars. 
That they held worship upon mountains was because mountains signified the heaven where celestial love reigns, which is love to the Lord; that they held it upon hills was because hills signified the 
heaven where spiritual love reigns, which is love toward the neighbor; and that they held it in groves was because groves signified heavenly wisdom and intelligence. All these things are from correspondences. 
The pillars that were set up there signified Divine truth; for the pillars were stones, and a stone signifies truth. Therefore in respect to Divine truth the Lord is called in the Word "the 
Stone of Israel." From this then it is that "pillars" signified the worship of the Lord from truths. [2] But when the representatives of the church which existed among the ancients began to be turned 
partly into idolatry and partly into magic, then such things were abrogated, especially among the Israelitish nation, which at heart was idolatrous. Hence it is that by "pillars" is signified idolatrous 
worship from falsities. This is the case with all worship when man becomes external, as when he regards himself and the world as the end, and the Divine things of the church as the means; for then 
all the things of worship, with those who remain in worship, become idols, because external things are worshiped apart from internal things. Consequently the truths of worship and of doctrine become 
falsities, for they are falsified by the ideas of self and of the world in them, to which are adjoined many other ideas which withdraw the Divine from these truths, and transfer them to self and to 
the world. This can also be seen from the altars of the nations, upon which their sacrifices were abominations, although they sacrificed in the same way as the Israelitish nation. [3] That pillars were 
in use among the ancients, and signified what is holy of worship, is evident from the pillar set up by Jacob, of which we read in Genesis: </p>
<p>     And Jacob took the stone that he had placed for his 
pillows, and set it up for a pillar. And he said, If I return in peace to my father's house, this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house (Gen. 28:18, 21, 22). And from the twelve 
pillars set up by Moses under Mount Sinai, of which we read in Exodus: </p>
<p>     Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve 
pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel (Exod. 24:4; see also n. 9389). And from these passages: </p>
<p>     In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar 
at the border thereof to Jehovah (Isa. 19:19).      The sons of Israel shall sit many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar (Hos. 3:4). In these passages 
by "pillars" is signified worship from truths, for the reason, as before said, that a "stone" signified Divine truth, and a "pillar anointed with oil," Divine truth from Divine good. [4] But when these 
representatives began to be idolatrously worshiped, it was then commanded that such things should be overturned and broken, as in this verse, and also in Exodus 23:24; Deuteronomy 7:5; 12:3. And as 
the Israelitish nation was at heart idolatrous, therefore lest they should set up pillars upon mountains and hills, and in groves, and should worship them idolatrously, they were forbidden to set up 
pillars and to plant groves, although among the ancients such things were holy things of worship. That this was forbidden to that nation is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of 
any tree near the altar of Jehovah thy God, which thou shalt make for thee. And thou shalt not set thee up a pillar, which Jehovah thy God hateth (Deut. 16:21, 22). And that it was forbidden because 
they worshiped these things idolatrously, is evident from these passages: </p>
<p>     Judah did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; they built them high places, and pillars, on every high hill, and under every green 
tree (1 Kings 14:22, 23).      The like is said of the sons of Israel in 2 Kings 17:10.      I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no longer adore 
the work of thine hands. And I will root out thy groves from the midst of thee (Micah 5:13, 14).      Ye have inflamed yourselves with gods under every green tree (Isa. 57:5).      With the hoofs 
of his horses shall Nebuchadrezzar tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall he make to go down to the earth (Ezek. 26:11); </p>
<p>besides 
other places. From these passages also it is evident what is signified by "pillars" in the internal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10643</b></p><p><b>10643.</b>
'And break their pillars' means that falsities of evil are to be done away with. This is clear from the meaning of 'pillars' as representative signs of worship of the Lord which springs from truths, 
dealt with in <a href="4580.htm">4580</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>, <a href="9388.htm">9388</a>, <a href="9389.htm">9389</a>, and in the contrary sense as representative signs of idolatrous worship arising from falsities, <a href="3727.htm">3727</a>. The reason why pillars were signs representative of worship 
was that among the ancients it was customary to set up pillars, anoint them with oil, and in so doing make them holy objects. The ancients performed their worship chiefly on mountains, on hills, and in 
groves, where they set the pillars up. The reason why they set them up on mountains was that mountains served to mean the heaven where celestial love, which is love to the Lord, reigns; the reason why 
they set them up on hills was that hills served to mean the heaven where spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbour, reigns; and the reason why they set them up in groves was that groves served 
to mean heavenly wisdom and intelligence. All these had their origin in correspondences. The pillars which were set up in those places served as signs of Divine Truth; for the pillars were pieces 
of stone, and 'stone' means truth. And therefore in the Word the Lord in respect of Divine Truth is called the Stone of Israel. These then are the reasons why pillars were signs of worship of the Lord 
springing from truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But when the representative signs of the Church which existed among the ancients began to be converted partly into what was idolatrous and partly into that which was 
magical, those signs were brought to an end, especially among the Israelite nation, which was idolatrous at heart. This is why idolatrous worship arising from falsities is also meant by 'pillars'. So 
it is with all worship when people become interested only in what is external, as happens when they regard self and the world as the end, and Divine things of the Church as the means. For then in the 
case of those who still engage in acts of worship, everything belonging to worship is turned into an idol, because outward forms without their inner realities are being worshipped. Consequently the truths 
contained in worship and religious teachings are turned into falsities; for they are falsified by the selfish and worldly thoughts entering into them, to which very many other notions become attached 
that take what is God's from those truths and assign them to self and the world. All this may also be recognized in the altars of the gentile nations; although they offered sacrifices on them in 
a similar way to the Israelite nation, those sacrifices were nevertheless abominations.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The customary existence of pillars among the ancients, serving to mean the holiness of worship, is clear 
from the pillar erected by Jacob, described in Genesis as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
And Jacob took the stone which he had placed as his headrest, and placed it as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. And he 
said, If I come back in peace to my father's house, this stone which I have placed as a pillar will be God's house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:18,21,22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:18,21,22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The same thing is clear from the twelve pillars set up by Moses 
at the foot of Mount Sinai, spoken of as follows in Exodus and dealt with in <a href="9389.htm">9389</a>,  </p>
<blockquote>
Moses wrote all Jehovah's words. And he rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the mountain, 
and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that day there will be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at 
its border. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
The children of Israel will sit many days with no king, and no prince, and no sacrifice, and no pillar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%203:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 3:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In these places worship springing 
from truths is meant by 'pillars', because stone was a sign of Divine Truth, as stated above; and a pillar anointed with oil was a sign of Divine Truth emanating from Divine Good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But when those 
representative objects began to be worshipped in an idolatrous manner, the command came for them to be overthrown and broken, as in the present verse and also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:24</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:5;%2012:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:5; 12:3</a>. And since 
the Israelite nation was idolatrous at heart, to prevent them from setting up pillars on mountains and hills, or in groves, and worshipping them in an idolatrous manner, they were forbidden to set 
up pillars or to plant groves, even though for the ancients such things had been holy objects belonging to worship. The fact that this nation was forbidden to do so is clear in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
You shall 
not plant for yourself a grove of any kind of tree beside the altar of your God which you shall make for yourself. And you shall not erect for yourself a pillar, which Jehovah your God indeed hates. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:21,22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16:21,22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And the fact that they were forbidden to do so because they worshipped those objects in an idolatrous manner is clear in the first Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>Judah<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> did what was evil in the 
eyes of Jehovah; they built for themselves high places and pillars on every high hill, and under every green tree. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 14:22,<a href="23.htm">23</a>.  </p>
<p>The like is said about the children of Israel<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, in <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 
17:10. In Micah,  </p>
<p>I will cut down your carved images and your pillars from the midst of you, and you will adore no more the work of your hands. And I will uproot your groves from the midst of you. 
Micah 5:13,<a href="14.htm">14</a>.  </p>
<p>In Isaiah,  </p>
<p>You inflamed yourselves among the gods under every green tree. Isa. 57:5.  </p>
<p>And in Ezekiel,  </p>
<p>By means of the hoofs of his horses Nebuchadnezzar will trample all 
your streets, slay the people with the sword, and cause your mighty pillars<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> to come down to the ground. Ezek. 26:11.  </p>
<p>The same thing may in addition be seen in other places, which likewise show 
what is meant in the internal sense by 'pillars'.

`Et statuas eorum frangetis':  quod significet quod falsa mali dissipanda, constat ex significatione `statuarum' quod sint repraesentativa cultus Domini ex veris, de qua n. 4580, 4582, 9388, 9389, et 
in opposito sensu repraesentativa cultus (x)idololatrici, ex falsis, n.3727.  Quod statuae essent {1}repraesentativae cultus, erat quia apud antiquos in usu fuit statuas ponere, et illas oleo ungere, 
et sic sanctificare{2}; antiqui praecipue cultum suum {3}habuerunt super montibus, super collibus, ac in lucis, {4}ibi statuas ponebant; quod super montibus, erat causa quia montes {5}significabant 
caelum ubi amor caelestis regnat, qui est amor in Dominum; quod super collibus, erat causa quia colles significabant caelum ubi amor spiritualis regnat, qui est amor erga proximum; et quod in lucis, erat 
causa quia luci significabant caelestem sapientiam et intelligentiam'; omnia haec ex correspondentiis; statuae (x)quae ibi ponebantur {6}significabant Divinum Verum, nam statuae erant {7}lapides, 
et lapis significat verum; ideo Dominus quoad Divinum Verum in Verbo vocatur lapis Israelis; [2] inde nunc est quod statuae {8}significaverint cultum Domini ex veris; sed cum repraesentativa Ecclesiae 
quae apud antiquos fuerunt, verti partim in idololatrica et partim in magica coeperunt, tunc talia abrogata sunt, imprimis apud gentem Israeliticam, quae corde idololatra fuit; inde est quod per `statuas' 
significetur cultus idololatricus ex falsis; ita se habet cum omni cultu quando homo fit externus, quod fit cum spectat se et mundum ut finem, ac {9}Divina Ecclesiae ut media, nam tunc omnia illa 
quae cultus sunt, apud illos qui in cultu manent, fiunt idola, quoniam coluntur externa absque internis; inde vera cultus et {10} doctrinae fiunt falsa, falsificantur enim per ideas sui et mundi in 
illis quibus adjunguntur plures aliae ideae, quae Divinum a veris illis abducunt et ad se et ad mundum transferunt.  Hoc quoque constare potest ex altaribus gentium, {11}super quibus tametsi similiter 
sacrificabant, usque (x)sacrificia illarum abominationes erant. 	[3] Quod statuae apud antiquos in usu (x)fuerint, ac {12}significaverint sanctum cultus, constat ex statua a Jacobo erecta, de qua ita 
in Genesi, 	Et Jacob sumpsit lapidem quem posuerat subcapitalia sua, et posuit illum statuam, et fudit oleum super caput ejus, et dixit, Si rediero in pace ad domum patris mei, lapis hic quem posui 
statuam, erit domus Dei, xxviii 18, (x)21, 22: </p>
<p>et a duodecim statuis a Mosche positis sub monte Sinai, de quibus ita in Exodo, 	Scripsit Moscheh omnia verba Jehovae, et surrexit mane in matutino et 
aedificavit altare sub monte, et duodecim statuas pro duodecim tribubus Israelis, xxiv 4, et n. 9389: </p>

terminum ejus Jehovae, xix 19: </p>
<p>et apud Hoscheam, 	Dies multos sedebunt filii Israelis, non rex, et non princeps, et non sacrificium, et non statua, {13}iii 4; </p>
<p>in illis locis per `statuas' significatur 
cultus ex veris, ex causa, ut supra dictum, quia lapis significabat Divinum Verum; ac statua uncta oleo Divinum Verum a Divino Bono. 	[4] Ast cum repraesentativa illa coeperunt idololatrice coli, 
tunc mandatum est ut talia everterentur et frangerentur, (x)ut in hoc versu, (x)et quoque Exod. xxiii 24; Deut. vii 5, {14} xii 3; et quia gens Israelitica corde idololatra fuit, ne super montibus et 
collibus ac in lucis ponerent statuas, (c)et illas idololatrice colerent, vetitum fuit statuas ponere et lucos plantare, tametsi {15}talia antiquis fuerunt sancta cultus; quod vetitum fuerit illi genti, 
constat apud Moschen, 	Non plantabis tibi lucum cujuscumque arboris apud altare Dei tui quod facies tibi; neque eriges tibi statuam, quippe quam odit Jehovah Deus tuus, Deut. (x)xvi 21, 22: </p>
<p>et quod
