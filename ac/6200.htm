<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6200.</strong>我因一直（九年来没有间断）在灵人与天使的陪伴下生活，所以能仔细观察流注的性质。当我一直在思考时，我思想中的物质观念可以说就呈现在一个波浪状运动的中间。我注意到，这种波浪无非是由诸如已经与我正在思想的记忆中的那个主题粘附在一起的那类观念构成，灵人便以这种方式看见一个人的全部思维。不过，除了在中间呈现为一个物质观念的东西外，没有什么东西进入人的意识。我把周围的这种波浪比作属灵的翅膀，这翅膀有助于将此人正在思想的事从他的记忆中提升出来。这人由此就会意识到那事。波浪状运动在其中发生的周围材料包含无数与我正在思想的主题一致的事物。这一点通过以下事实向我清楚显明：住在更完美气场中的灵人从这些事就能知道我对于该主题所获知的一切。由此向我表明，灵人充分接受并吸收一个人所知道的一切，而只对他的欲望和情感感兴趣的魔鬼则接受并吸收属于其诸爱的方方面面。<br />举例说明这一点：当我想到我所认识的一个人时，此人的形像，就是诸如一提到一个人名字就会想到的那种形像，便出现在中间。我从小对于此人所曾知道和思想的一切则在他的形像周围，看上去就像上下翻动的鸟的翅膀。因此，诸如存在于我思维和情感中的此人的整个性质一瞬间就呈现在灵人面前。当我思想某个城市时，类似情形也会发生。灵人从周围这种波浪状的气场能瞬间知道我对于这座城市所曾看见并知道的一切。我的科学知识也是这种情形。</p>

As I have been now continuously for nine years in company with spirits and angels, I have carefully observed how the case is with regard to influx. While I have been thinking, the material ideas of my 
thought appeared as it were In the middle of a kind of undulation,* and I noticed that this undulation was nothing else than such things as had been adjoined to that subject in the memory, and that 
the full thought appears in this way to the spirits; but that nothing else then comes to the man's apprehension than that which is In the middle and which had appeared as material. I have likened that 
surrounding undulation to spiritual wings, by which the thing thought of is elevated out of the memory. From this the man has perception of a subject. That in that surrounding undulation there were innumerable 
things which agreed with the subject thought of, was made evident to me from the fact that the spirits who were in a more subtle sphere thereby knew all those things which I had ever known 
on that subject; and thus that they fully imbibe and put on all things which belong to the man; and genii, who attend solely to the cupidities and affections, imbibe and put on those things which are 
of the loves. To illustrate this by an example: When I thought of a man whom I know, then the idea of him, such as it appears when his name is mentioned before a man, was presented in the midst; but round 
about, like an undulating volatile something (undans volatile), was everything that I had known and thought about him from childhood; whereby the whole of him, such as he was in my thought and affection, 
appeared among the spirits In an instant. Moreover when I have been thinking about any city, then from that undulating sphere that was round about, the spirits instantly knew all that I had seen 
and known about it. The case was the same with matters of science. * Thought represented by an undulating sphere with a solid in the middle. When a stone is thrown into clam water it produces a concentric 
undulation. This however is only in a plane. But imagine a sphere or globe of some fluid medium with such an exciting object in the middle, and undulations going away from it in all directions. 
This may give some idea of the "material ideas in the middle" and the "volatile undulating sphere" all around it. </p>

Because I have been living - constantly, for nine years now<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - in company with spirits and angels, I have been able to take careful note of the nature of influx. When I have been thinking, the material 
ideas in my thought have presented themselves so to speak in the middle of a wave-like motion. I have noticed that the wave was made up of nothing other than such ideas as had become attached to the 
particular matter in my memory that I was thinking about, and that a person's entire thought is seen by spirits in this way. But nothing else enters that person's awareness then apart from what is in 
the middle which has presented itself as a material idea. I have likened that wave round about to spiritual wings which serve to raise the particular matter the person is thinking about up out of his 
memory. And in this way the person becomes aware of that matter. The surrounding material in which the wave-like motion takes place contained countless things that harmonized with the matter I was thinking 
about. This was made clear to me by the fact that from those things spirits living in a more perfect sphere knew everything I had ever learned on that particular subject. It accordingly showed 
me that spirits take in and absorb everything a Person knows, while genii, who are interested solely in his desires and affections, do the same to all aspects of his loves. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let the following example 
illustrate the point. Whenever I have thought about a person I knew, an image of that person, like that which comes to anyone s mind when his name is mentioned, presented itself in the middle. 
But round about the image of him - looking like the wings of a bird that are moving up and down - there was everything I had known and thought since childhood regarding that person. Consequently the entire 
character of that person as it existed in my thought and affection presented itself to spirits in an instant. The like has also happened whenever I have thought about any city. From the sphere round 
about moving like a wave spirits knew in an instant everything I had ever seen in it or known about it. The same thing has applied to my scientific knowledge.

Quia continue nunc per novem annos in consortio cum spiritibus et angelis fui, sedulo observavi quomodo cum influxu se habet.  Cum cogitavi, apparuerunt ideae materiales cogitationis, quasi in medio 
cujusdam undae, et observatum quod unda illa non aliud esset quam talia quae adjuncta sunt rei illi in memoria, et quod sic cogitatio plena spiritibus appareat, sed quod ad sensum hominis tunc non aliud 
veniat quam quod in medio est et sicut materiale apparuit; assimilavi undam illam circumcirca alis spiritualibus per quas, res quae cogitatur, elevatur e memoria; inde est homini apperceptio rei. 
 Quod in undante illa materia circumcirca fuerint innumera rei convenientia, constare mihi potuit ex eo quod spiritus qui in subtiliore sphaera, inde sciverint omnia illa quae ego de illa re usquam noveram, 
et sic quod plene hauriant et induant omnia quae hominis sunt; ac genii qui solum ad cupiditates et affectiones attendunt, illa quae amorum sunt.  [2]Sit exemplum illustrationi:  cum de homine 
mihi noto cogitavi, tunc illius idea qualis apparet cum coram homine ille nominatur, sistebatur in medio, sed circumcirca, sicut undans volatile, omnia quae de illo sciveram et cogitaveram a pueritia; 
inde ille totus qualis in mea cogitatione et affectione fuit, apud spiritus momento apparuit; etiam cum de aliqua urbe cogitavi, tunc ex undante illa sphaera circumcirca spiritus sciebant momento omnia 
quae vidi et de ea novi; ita quoque se habuit cum rebus scientiae. </p>
