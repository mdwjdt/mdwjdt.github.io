<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5938节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5938.</strong>“你要对你弟兄们说”表关于属世层中的教会真理，也就是说对它们的觉知或觉察。这从“约瑟的弟兄们”的代表清楚可知，“约瑟的弟兄们”是指属世层中的教会真理（参看<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）。此处法老邀请雅各的儿子们连同他们的小孩子和妻子到埃及来，把他们连他们的父亲都接来，因为法老说：“你要对你弟兄们说，你们要这样行：从埃及地带着车辆去，把你们的小孩子和妻子，并你们的父亲都接来。”然而，前面约瑟请的是他的父亲，并没有请他的弟兄们，除非是他父亲的儿子，因为他说：“你们要上到我父亲那里，对他说，请你下到我这里来，不要耽延。你和你的儿子、儿子的儿子，并一切所有的，你们都可以住在歌珊地，与我相近，你们又要赶紧请我父亲下到这里来。”法老请雅各的儿子们，而约瑟请他父亲的原因若不通过内义，并不明显，内义是这样：法老所代表的总的属世层与雅各的儿子们所代表的属世层中的教会真理有直接的交流。正因如此，法老会提到他们。但约瑟所代表的内在属天层与属世层中的教会真理，就是雅各的儿子们，并没有直接交流。但它通过属灵良善，就是他们的父亲以色列而拥有交流。因此，约瑟提到他的父亲。</p>

Say unto thy brethren. That this signifies about the truths of the church in the natural (namely, that there is perception about them), is evident from the representation of Joseph's brethren, as being 
the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5458, 5512). Pharaoh here invites the sons of Jacob to come into Egypt with their babes and women, and to bring their father with them; for 
Pharaoh says: "Say unto thy brethren, This do ye, and take your father, and take you out of the land of Egypt carts for your babes and for your women, and bring your father, and come." Joseph, however, 
just above invites his father, and his brethren no otherwise than as his father's sons, for he says: "Go up to my father, and say unto him, Come down unto me, tarry not; and thou shalt dwell in the 
land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and all that thou hast; haste ye and bring down my father hither." The reason why Pharaoh invited the sons of 
Jacob, and Joseph his father, is not plain except from the internal sense, which is, that the natural in general, which is represented by Pharaoh, has immediate communication with the truths of the church 
in the natural, which are represented by the sons of Jacob; and hence it is that Pharaoh speaks of them. But the internal celestial, which is represented by Joseph, has no immediate communication 
with the truths of the church in the natural, which are the sons of Jacob; but it has communication through spiritual good, which is Israel their father. This is the reason why Joseph speaks of his father. </p>

'Say to your brothers' means regarding the truths of the Church within the natural, that is to say, a perception regarding them. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph's brothers' as the truths 
of the Church within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>. Here Pharaoh invites the sons of Jacob to come to Egypt together with their young children and wives, and to bring their father 
with them, for Pharaoh says, </p>
<p>Say to your brothers, Do this, and take your father, and take for yourselves from the land of Egypt carts for your young children and your wives, and bring your father, 
and come. But just above Joseph invites his father, not his brothers except as his father's sons, for he says,  </p>
<p>Go up to my father, and say to him, Come down to me, do not delay. And you shall 
dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your sons, and the sons of your sons, and everything that belongs to you. Make haste, and cause my father to come down here. </p>
<p>The reason 
Pharaoh invited the sons of Jacob while Joseph invited his father is not evident except from the internal sense, which is this: The natural in general, which is represented by 'Pharaoh', has a direct 
communication with the truths of the Church within the natural, which are represented by 'the sons of Jacob'. Hence Pharaoh speaks about them. But the internal celestial, which is represented by 'Joseph', 
does not have a direct communication with the truths of the Church within the natural, which are 'the sons of Jacob'. The communication in this case is through spiritual good, which is 'Israel' 
their father. Hence Joseph speaks about their father. </p>

`Dic ad fratres tuos': quod significet de veris Ecclesiae in naturali, nempe quod sit perceptio, constat ex repraesentatione `fratrum Josephi' quod sint vera Ecclesiae in naturali, de qua n. 5403, 5419, 
5458, 5512. Hic Pharaoh invitat filios Jacobi ut veniant in Aegyptum cum infantibus et mulieribus, utque ferant patrem suum secum, nam dicit Pharaoh, `Dic ad fratres tuos, Hoc facite, et accipite 
patrem vestrum; et accipite vobis e terra Aegypti vehicula pro infantibus vestris et mulieribus vestris; et feratis patrem vestrum, et veniatis'; Joseph autem mox supra invitat patrem {1}suum, et non 
aliter fratres suos quam sicut illius; dicit enim, `Ascendite ad patrem meum, et dicatis ad illum, Descende ad me, ne subsistas, et habitabis in terra Goshen, et eris propinquus ad me, tu et filii tui, 
et filii filiorum tuorum, et omne quod tibi; {2}festinate, et descendere faciatis patrem meum huc'. Causa quod Pharaoh invitaverit filios Jacobi, et Josephus patrem, non patet nisi ex sensu interno; 
qui est quod {3} naturale in communi quod repraesentatur per `Pharaonem', immediatam communicationem habeat cum veris Ecclesiae in naturali quae repraesentantur per `filios Jacobi'; inde est quod Pharaoh 
de illis loquatur; at caeleste internum quod repraesentatur per `Josephum', non immediatam communicationem habet cum veris Ecclesiae in naturali quae {4}'filii Jacobi', sed per bonum spirituale 
quod est `Israel' pater illorum; inde est quod Joseph de patre loquatur. @1 et fratres suos per illum$ @2 sustentabo te ibi, festinetis$ @3 i nempe$ @4 i sunt$ </p>
