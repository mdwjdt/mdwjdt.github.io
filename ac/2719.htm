<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2719节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2719.</strong>本章首先论述了主的理性，它变成神性，由以撒来代表；然后论述了纯人类理性，它从主那里被分离出去，由埃及人夏甲的儿子来代表；紧接着论述了属灵教会，该教会凭借主的神圣人性而得救，由夏甲和她的孩子来代表；现在论述的是信之教义，它要服务于该教会，也就是说，基于记忆知识的纯人类理性概念要与它联结起来，这些概念由“亚比米勒和非各”来代表，而这种联结则由亚伯拉罕与他们所立的“约”来表示。这些理性概念只是一些表象，这些表象并非出于一个神性来源，而是出于一个人性来源。它们与信之教义联结，是因为若没有它们，属灵教会不会理解教义，因而不会接受它。因为如前所示（<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节），与属天教会成员相比，属灵教会成员居于模糊中，教义因此被笼罩在诸如构成人的思想情感的那类表象中。不过，这些表象不会差别到神性良善在它们里面找不到接纳它的某种容器的程度。由于26章会再次论述亚比米勒和约（不过，这约是他与以撒立的），并且就内义而言，那里所论述的主题是第二次与信之教义联结的理性概念和记忆知识，故只给出有关此处包含在内义中的事物的概述。通过对26章的解读，这些问题会变得更清楚。</p>

In this chapter the Lord's rational has first been treated of, as being made Divine, which rational is "Isaac;" then the merely human rational, as being separated, which is the "son of Hagar the Egyptian;" 
and afterwards the spiritual church, which was saved by the Lord's Divine Human, which church is "Hagar" and her "child." Now the doctrine of faith is treated of, which is to be serviceable to 
that church; namely, that human reasonings from memory-knowledges are adjoined to it, which are "Abimelech" and "Phicol." This conjunction is signified by the "covenant" which Abraham made with them. These 
reasonings are appearances, not from a Divine but from a human origin, which are adjoined for the reason that without them the spiritual church would not comprehend doctrine, and thus would not 
receive it. For, as was shown above (n. 2715), the man of the spiritual church is relatively in obscurity; and doctrine is therefore to be clothed with such appearances as are of human thought and affection, 
and is not to be in discrepancy to such a degree that the Divine good cannot have in them some kind of receptacle. As Abimelech is again treated of in the following twenty-sixth chapter, and 
also a covenant (but with Isaac); and in the internal sense, the reasonings and memory-knowledges added to the doctrine of faith a second time, only a summary may here be given of the things contained 
in the internal sense, which will become clearer by the explication of that chapter. </p>

The subject dealt with first in this chapter is the Lord's Rational, which was made Divine and is represented by Isaac, also the merely human rational that was separated from Him and is represented by 
the son of Hagar the Egyptian. Immediately after that the subject is the spiritual Church which was saved by means of the Lord's Divine Human, and is represented by Hagar and her boy. Now the subject 
is the doctrine of faith that was to be of service to that Church, that is to say, the merely human rational ideas based on facts were allied to it, which ideas are represented by 'Abimelech and Phicol'. 
This alliance is meant by 'the covenant' that Abraham made with them. Those rational ideas are appearances that come not from a Divine but from a human origin. They were allied to it for the reason 
that without them the spiritual Church would not be able to have any grasp of doctrine and so would not receive it. For, as shown in <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, the member of the spiritual Church, compared with the member 
of the celestial Church, dwells in obscurity, and doctrine has therefore to be shrouded in appearances such as make up human thought and affection, though these appearances must not be so at variance 
that Divine Good cannot find in them some receptacle for itself. Since a description occurs again, in Chapter <a href="26.htm">26</a>, of Abimelech, and of a covenant, though in that place he makes it with Isaac, and 
since the subject in the internal sense is the rational ideas and the factual knowledge linked a second time to the doctrine of faith, let merely a summary explanation be given of what is contained at 
this point in the internal sense. A clearer understanding of these matters will emerge from the explanation of Chapter <a href="26.htm">26</a>. </p>

Actum est in hoc capite primum de Rationali Domini quod Divinum factum, quod Rationale est `Jishakus'; et de rationali mere humano quod separatum, quod est `filius Hagaris Aegyptiae': mox de Ecclesia 
spirituali quae per Divinum Humanum Domini salvata est, quae Ecclesia est `Hagar et ejus puer': nunc agitur de doctrina fidei inservitura isti Ecclesiae, quod nempe adjuncta ei sint rationalia `ex scientificis' 
humana, quae sunt `Abimelechus et Phicol'; conjunctio significatur per `foedus' quod Abrahamus cum illis percussit; rationalia illa sunt apparentiae, non ex origine Divina sed ex humana, 
quae adjunctae sunt ob causam quia Ecclesia spiritualis absque illis doctrinam non comprehenderet, ita nec reciperet; est enim, ut n. 2715 ostensum, spiritualis Ecclesiae homo in obscuro respective, quare 
doctrina investienda apparentiis talibus quae sunt cogitationis et affectionis humanae, et non in tantum discrepant quin Divinum bonum receptaculi instar ibi habere possit. Quia agitur in seq. cap. 
xxvi iterum de Abimelecho, et de foedere, sed cum Isaco, et in sensu interno de rationalibus et scientificis secundo adjectis doctrinae fidei, licet solum summaria, quae in sensu interno de hac re 
hic continentur, exponere, quae clariora ab explicatione capitis xxvi evadent. 	@1 A had et scientifica but alters as here.$ </p>
