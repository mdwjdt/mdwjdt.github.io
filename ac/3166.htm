<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3166节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3166.</strong>“又将宝物送给她哥哥”表属灵事物从那里进入属世良善。这从“宝物”和“她哥哥”的含义清楚可知：“宝物”是指属灵事物，如下文所述；“她哥哥”是指属世良善（参看<a href="3160.htm">3160</a>节）；拉班，就是此处哥哥，是指属世人中的良善情感（参看<a href="3129.htm">3129</a>，<a href="3130.htm">3130</a>节）。“宝物”表属灵事物，这从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来，如摩西五经论约瑟说：<br />愿他的地蒙耶和华赐福，得天上的宝物、甘露，以及伏于地底下的渊泉；得太阳所出产的宝物，月亮所养成的宝物，得永世之岭的宝物，得地和其中所充满的宝物。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.13.htm">33:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“天上的宝物”、“太阳所出产的宝物”、“月亮所养成的宝物”、“永世之岭的宝物”和“地的宝物”表各种属灵事物。而且，所谓的宝物是指宝石、珍珠、香膏、香料及类似事物，它们全都表示属灵事物。<br />前面多次阐述了何为属灵事物，也就是说，主的国度有属天事物和属灵事物。属天事物是良善的形式，属灵事物是源于那良善的真理的形式。宇宙万物无不关乎良善与真理，凡与功用并生活有关的，皆关乎良善；凡与教义并记忆知识有关的，尤其涉及功用和生活的，皆关乎真理。或也可说，凡属于意愿的，都被称为良善或邪恶；凡属于理解力的，都被称为真理或虚假。因此，唯独属于爱和仁、从主所流入的良善是属天的；源于那良善的真理是属灵的。当“银器、金器和衣服”被送给成为新娘的妹子时，“宝物”被送给了哥哥，这是因为“哥哥”表示属世人中的良善，并且当真理被引入理性中的良善时，这良善就得到启示。事实上，属世人中良善与真理的一切启示皆由此而来。</p>

He gave also precious things to her brother. That this signifies spiritual things thence for natural good, is evident from the signification of "precious things," as being spiritual things, whereof we 
shall speak presently; and from the signification of her "brother," as being natural good (see n. 3160); Laban also, who is here the brother, is the affection of good in the natural man (see n. 3129, 
3130). That "precious things" signify spiritual things, is evident from other passages in the Word, as where Joseph is treated of, in Moses: </p>
<p>     Blessed of Jehovah be his land, for the precious things 
of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep lying beneath; and for the precious things of the produce of the sun, and for the precious things of the growth of the months, and for the precious things 
of the hills of eternity, and for the precious things of the earth, and of the fullness thereof (Deut. 33:13-16); </p>
<p>     where by the "precious things of heaven, the precious things of the produce of 
the sun, the precious things of the growth of the months, the precious things of the hills of eternity, and the precious things of the earth," are signified various kinds of spiritual things. Moreover 
the things called precious were precious stones, pearls, balsams, spices, and the like, all which signify spiritual things. [2] What spiritual things are, has been frequently stated above, namely, that 
in the Lord's kingdom there are celestial things and spiritual things, and that celestial things are of good, and spiritual things are of the derivative truth. There is nothing in the universe that 
does not refer to good and truth; whatever is of use, and of life, refers to good; but whatever is of doctrine and memory-knowledge, especially concerning use and life, refers to truth; or what is the 
same, whatever is of the will, is called good or evil; but whatever is of the understanding is called truth or falsity; and therefore good, which is solely of love and charity, and which flows in from 
the Lord, is celestial; whereas truth, which is therefrom, is spiritual. The reason why precious things were given to the brother, when vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and garments were given 
to the sister, on her becoming a bride, is that the "brother" signified good in the natural man, and this good is enlightened when truth is being initiated into good in the rational; for all the enlightenment 
of good and of truth in the natural man is thence. </p>

'And he gave precious things to her brother' means spiritual things passing from there to natural good. This is clear from the meaning of 'precious things' as spiritual things, dealt with in what follows, 
and from the meaning of 'a brother' as natural good, dealt with in <a href="3160.htm">3160</a>, and also of 'Laban', to whom 'her brother' refers here, as the affection for good in the natural man, dealt with in <a href="3129.htm">3129</a>, <a href="3130.htm">3130</a>. It is also clear from other parts of the Word that 'precious things' means spiritual things, for example, from the reference to Joseph in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed by Jehovah is his land, in regard to 
the precious things of heaven, to the dew, and to the deep lying beneath, and to the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and to the precious things of the produce of the months, and to the precious 
things of the eternal hills, and to the precious things of the earth and of its fulness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:13-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:13-16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the precious things of heaven', 'the precious things of the fruits of the sun', 'the 
precious things of the produce of the months', 'the precious things of the eternal hills', and 'the precious things of the earth' mean various kinds of spiritual things. The word 'precious' was also 
applied to precious stones, pearls, balms, spices, and similar commodities, which all mean spiritual things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What spiritual things are has been stated many times already, namely that in the Lord's 
kingdom there are celestial things and there are spiritual things. Celestial things are forms of good, spiritual things forms of truth from that good. Nothing exists in the universe that is unrelated 
to good or to truth. Everything to do with use and life is related to good, whereas everything to do with doctrine and knowledge, in particular concerning use and life, is related to truth. Or what 
amounts to the same, that which belongs to the will is called good or evil, whereas that which belongs to the understanding is referred to as truth or falsity. Good therefore, being that alone which 
is the expression of love and charity and which flows in from the Lord, is celestial, whereas truth, being that which springs from good, is spiritual. The reason 'precious things' were given to the 
brother when 'vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and garments' were given to the sister when she became a bride was that the brother meant good in the natural man, and this good is enlightened when 
truth is introduced into good in the rational. Indeed this is the origin of all enlightenment of good and truth in the natural man. </p>

</p><b>3166.</b>
`Et pretiosa dedit fratri ejus': quod significet spiritualia bono naturali inde, constat ex significatione `pretiosorum' quod sint spiritualia, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `fratris' quod sit 
bonum naturale, de qua n. 3160; ut et {1}`Labani' qui hic est `frater' quod sit affectio {2}boni in naturali homine, de qua n. 3129, 3130; quod `pretiosa' significent spiritualia, constat ex verbo 
etiam alibi, ut ubi agitur de Josepho, {3}apud Mosen,           Benedicta a Jehovah terra ejus, de pretioso caeli, de      rore, et de abysso jacente subter: et de pretioso proventuum      solis; et 
de pretioso producti mensium;...et de pretioso      collium aeternitatis, et de pretioso terrae et plenitudinis      ejus, Deut. xxxiii 13-16; </p>
<p>ibi per `pretiosum caeli, pretiosum proventuum solis, 
pretiosum producti mensium, pretiosum collium aeternitatis, et pretiosum terrae' significantur varia genera spiritualium: praeterea pretiosa dicebantur lapides pretiosi, margaritae, balsama, aromata, 
ac similia, quae omnia significant spiritualia. [2] Quid spiritualia, prius multoties dictum est, nempe quod in regno Domini sint caelestia et sint spiritualia, et quod caelestia sint boni, ac spiritualia 
veri inde; nihil `in universo est', quod non ad bonum et ad verum se refert; omne quod est usus et vitae, se refert ad bonum, quod autem est doctrinae et scientiae cumprimis de usu et vita, ad 
verum, seu quod idem, quod est voluntatis, vocatur bonum vel malum, quod autem est intellectus, dicitur verum vel falsum; {4}bonum itaque, quod solum est amoris et charitatis, et a Domino influit, est 
caeleste, verum autem quod inde, est spirituale. Cur fratri data sunt `pretiosa,' quando sorori cum facta sponsa, `vasa argenti, vasa auri, et vestes,' causa erat quia frater significabat bonum in naturali 
homine, et quia bonum hoc illustratur cum verum initiatur bono in rationali; omnis enim illustratio boni et veri in naturali homine est inde. @1 Labanus I$  @2 veri AI but see n. 3139$  @3 before 
agitur$  @4 verum ex bono, quia a Domino influit, est spirituale$  </p>
