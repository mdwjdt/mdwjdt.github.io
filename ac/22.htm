<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第22节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>22.</strong>创世记1:5 有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日。<br />从这句经文，可知“晚上”、“早晨”各为何义。“晚上”，指每个先前的阶段，因为相对而言，先前的阶段表现为黑暗、愚痴、无信。“早晨”，指每个后续的阶段，因为相对而言，后续的阶段表现为光明、真知、有信。<br />笼统而言，“晚上”，表一切属于人的，“早晨”，表一切属于主的。正如经上说：“耶和华的灵藉着我说，他的话在我口中。以色列的神，以色列的磐石晓谕我说……他必像日出的晨光，如无云的清晨，雨后的晴光，使地生出嫩草。”（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.4.htm">4</a>）<br />正因“晚上”表无信，“早晨”表有信，主的降临故被称为“早晨”，他来的时候，正是世上缺乏信的时候，故被称为“晚上”。正如经上说：“圣者对我说，要延到二千三百个暮暮朝朝，圣所才能洁净。”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.14.htm">8:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.26.htm">26</a>）在圣经中，“早晨”也被用来指主的每一次降临，故意味着重新创造。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]22.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_5" target=_top>Genesis 1:5</a>. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.<br />From this we now see what evening and morning mean. Evening is every preliminary stage, because such stages are marked by shadow, or by falsity and an absence of faith. Morning is all later stages, because these are marked by light, or by truth and religious knowledge.<br />Evening stands in general for everything that is our own, while morning stands for everything of the Lord's. As David says, for example:<br />The Spirit of Jehovah has spoken in me and his words are on my tongue. The God of Israel has said, the rock of Israel has spoken to me. He is like the morning light when the sun rises, like a morning when there are no clouds, when because of the brightness, because of the rain, the tender grass springs from the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_23_2-3" target=_top>2 Samuel 23:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_23_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />Since evening is when there is no faith and morning is when there is faith, the Lord's coming into the world is called morning. The period in which he came, being a time of no faith, is called evening. In Daniel:<br />The Holy One said to me, "Up till [the day's second] evening, when it becomes morning,{*1} two thousand and three hundred times." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22/bible_king-james-version_daniel_8_14" target=_top>Daniel 8:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22/bible_king-james-version_daniel_8_26" target=_top>26</a>)<br />Morning in the Word is similarly taken to mean every coming of the Lord, so that it is a word for being created anew.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "Up till [the day's second] evening" means "when the night becomes morning." In addition to the usual meaning as the time when day turns into night, Swedenborg considered the word "evening" in Old Testament idiom to apply as well to the twilight before dawn.

Verse 5. And the evening and the morning were the first day. What is meant by "evening" and what by "morning" can now be discerned. "Evening" means every preceding state, because it is a state of shade, 
or of falsity and of no faith; "morning" is every subsequent state, being one of light, or of truth and of the knowledges of faith, "Evening" in a general sense, signifies all things that are of man's 
own; but "morning" whatever is of the Lord, as is said through David: </p>
<p>     The spirit of Jehovah spake in me, and His word was on my tongue; the God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me. 
He is as the light of the morning, when the sun ariseth, even a morning without clouds, when from brightness, from rain, the tender herb springeth out of the earth (2 Sam. 23:2-4). As it is "evening" 
when there is no faith, and "morning" when there is faith, therefore the coming of the Lord into the world is called "morning;" and the time when He comes, because then there is no faith, is called 
"evening" as in Daniel: </p>
<p>     The Holy One said unto me, Even unto evening when it becomes morning, two thousand and three hundred (Dan. 8:14, 26). In like manner "morning" is used in the Word to denote 
every coming of the Lord, consequently it is an expression of new creation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 22</b></p><p><b>22.</b>
Verse 5 And there was evening, and there was morning, the first day.  What 'evening' means, and what 'morning', is recognized from what is said above. 'Evening' means every prior state, because it is 
a state of shade, that is, of falsity and of absence of faith, while 'morning' is every subsequent state, because it is one of light, that is, of truth and of cognitions of faith. 'Evening' in general 
means all the things that are man's own, whereas 'morning' means all those that are the Lord's, as is said through David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Spirit of Jehovah has spoken within me, and His word is upon my tongue. 
The God of Israel has said, the Rock of Israel has spoken to me. He is like the morning light, when the sun is rising on a cloudless morning, shining bright, as when after rain tender grass [springs 
up] from the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2023:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 23:4</a>.   
</blockquote>
Because 'evening' is a time when there is no faith, and 'morning' when there is, the Lord's Coming into the world is called 'the morning', and the time at which 
He comes, since faith does not exist at that point, is called 'the evening', as in Daniel,   The Holy One said to me, Up to the evening when it is becoming morning, two thousand three hundred times. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:13, 14</a>.   In the Word, 'morning' stands in a similar way for every coming of the Lord, and so is a term describing the new creation.  </p>

Vers. 5.  Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies primus.  Quid vespera et quid mane, inde jam noscitur.  'Vespera' est omnis status praecedens, quia umbrae, seu falsitatis et nullius fidei; 'mane' est 
omnis status sequens, quia lucis, seu veritatis et cognitionum fidei 'Vespera' in genere significat omnia quae propria sunt hominis; 'mane' autem quae sunt Domini; ut per Davidem, </p>
<p>	Spiritus Jehovae 
locutus est in me, et sermo ipsius 	super lingua mea; dixit Deus Israelis, mihi locutus est Petra Israelis,...Ille sicut lux mane, dum oritur sol, mane non nubes, dum a splendore, a pluvia, herba tenera 
e terra, 	2 Sam. xxiii 2-4. </p>
<p>Quia 'vespera' est quando nulla fides, et 'mane' quando fides, Adventus Domini in mundum appellatur 'mane,' et tempus quando venit, quia tunc nulla fides, appellatur 
'vespera'; apud Danielem, 	Sanctus dixit ad me, Usque ad vesperam, cum fit mane, bis mille et trecenta, {x}viii 14, 26. Similiter accipitur 'mane' pro omni adventu Domini, in Verbo, ita est vox novae 
creationis.
