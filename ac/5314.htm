<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5314.</strong>创世记41:41-44.法老又对约瑟说，看，我派你治理埃及全地。法老就摘下手上的戒指，戴在约瑟的手上，给他穿上细麻衣，把金项链戴在他的颈项上。又叫约瑟坐他所拥有的副车，有人在他前面喊着：跪下！于是，法老派他治理埃及全地。法老对约瑟说，我是法老，在埃及全地，若没有你，没有人可举手或抬脚。<br />“法老又对约瑟说”表出现在属世层但却是从属灵层的属天层所得来的进一步的觉知。“看，我派你治理埃及全地”表掌管属世层的这两个部分的权柄。“法老就摘下手上的戒指”表对属世层先前所拥有权柄的一种确认。“戴在约瑟的手上”表属世层将一切能力都交给属灵层的属天层。“给他穿上细麻衣”表一个外在标志，表示属灵层的属天层，“细麻衣”是指从神性发出的真理。“把金项链戴在他的颈项上”表一个外在标志，表示内层事物与外层事物的联结；实现这种联结的，是良善。“又叫约瑟坐副车”表一个外在标志，即属灵层的属天层是良善与真理的一切教义的源头。“他所拥有的”表通过属世层而来的东西。“有人在他前面喊着：跪下”表经由信而来的承认，以及崇拜。“于是，法老派他治理埃及全地”表它的权柄如所描述的那样。“法老对约瑟说”表还要进一步的觉知。“我是法老”表属世层即源于此，或这使得属世层成为原本的样子。“若没有你，没有人可举手”表属灵层中的一切能力都是从属灵层的属天层那里得来的。“或抬脚”表属世层中的一切能力。“在埃及全地”表在属世层的这两个部分中。</p>

Verses 41-44. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments 
of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold upon his neck; and he made him ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried before him, Abrech; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh 
said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph," signifies the further perception of the natural 
from the celestial of the spiritual; "See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt," signifies dominion over both naturals. "And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand," signifies a confirming 
of the power the natural previously had; "and put it upon Joseph's hand," signifies that the natural yielded all the power to the celestial of the spiritual; "and clothed him in garments of fine 
linen," signifies an external significative of the celestial of the spiritual; ("garments of fine linen" are truths from the Divine); "and put a necklace of gold upon his neck," signifies a significative 
of the conjunction of interior things with exterior, effected by good; "and he made him ride in the second chariot," signifies a significative that from this comes all the doctrine of good and truth; 
"that he had," signifies that comes by means of the natural; "and they cried before him, Abrech," signifies acknowledgment through faith, and adoration; "and he set him over all the land of Egypt," 
signifies that such was its authority; "and Pharaoh said unto Joseph," signifies still further perception; "I am Pharaoh," signifies that the natural is thence derived; "and without thee shall no man 
lift up his hand," signifies that from the celestial of the spiritual is everything of power in the spiritual; "or his foot," signifies and everything of power in the natural; "in all the land of Egypt," 
signifies in both naturals. </p>

Verses 41-44 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand and put it onto Joseph's hand, and clothed him in robes of fine 
linen, and placed a chain of gold onto his neck. And he made him ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried out before him, Abrek! and he set him over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh 
said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh said to Joseph' means a further perception present in the natural but 
received from the celestial of the spiritual. 'See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt' means dominion over both parts of the natural. 'And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand' means 
a confirmation regarding the power which belonged at first to the natural. 'And put it onto Joseph's hand' means that it yielded all that power to the celestial of the spiritual. 'And clothed him in robes 
of fine linen' means an outward sign denoting the celestial of the spiritual, 'robes of fine linen' being truths going forth from the Divine. 'And placed a chain of gold onto his neck' means an outward 
sign denoting the joining of interior things to exterior ones, good being that which effects that joining together. 'And he made him ride in the second chariot' means an outward sign that the celestial 
of the spiritual was the source of all the teaching about goodness and truth. 'That he had' means which is imparted through the natural. 'And they cried out before him, Abrek!' means acknowledgement 
coming through faith, and homage. 'And he set him over all the land of Egypt' means that its authority was as described. 'And Pharaoh said to Joseph' means further perception still. 'I am Pharaoh' 
means that this made the natural what it was. 'And without you shall no man lift up his hand' means that all power in the spiritual was received from the celestial of the spiritual. 'Or his foot' 
means all power in the natural. 'In all the land of Egypt' means in both parts of the natural. </p>

Vers. 41-44.  Et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum, Vide, dedi te super omnem terram Aegypti. Et removit Pharaoh annulum suum a super manu sua, et dedit illum super manum Josephi, et vestivit eum vestibus byssi, 
et posuit torquem auri super collum ejus. Et vehi fecit eum in curru secundario qui sibi, et clamaverunt ante eum, Abrech, et dando eum super omnem terram Aegypti. Et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum, 
Ego Pharaoh, et praeter te non extollet vir manum suam et pedem suum, in omni terra Aegypti. `Et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum' significat ulteriorem perceptionem naturalis e caelesti spiritualis: `Vide, 
dedi te super omnem terram Aegypti' significat dominium super utrumque naturale: `et removit Pharaoh annulum suum a super manu sua' significat confirmativum de potentia quae prius ei: `et dedit illum 
super manum Josephi' significat quod illam cesserit omnem caelesti spiritualis: `et vestivit eum vestibus byssi' significat significativum externum caelestis spiritualis; `vestes byssi' sunt vera ex Divino: 
'et posuit torquem auri super collum ejus' significat significativum conjunctionis interiorum cum exterioribus, efficiente bono: `et vehi fecit eum in curru secundario' significat significativum 
quod ab illo omnis doctrina boni et veri: `qui sibi' significat quae per naturale: `et clamaverunt ante eum, Abrech' significat agnitionem per fidem et adorationem: `et dando eum super omnem terram 
Aegypti' significat potestatem illius quod talis: `et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum' significat perceptionem adhuc ulteriorem: `Ego Pharaoh' significat quod inde naturale: `et praeter te non extollet vir 
manum suam' significat quod a caelesti spiritualis omne potentiae in spirituali: `et pedem suum' significat quod omne potentiae in naturali: `in omni terra Aegypti' significat in utroque naturali.   </p>
