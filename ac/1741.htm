<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1741节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1741.</strong>“对亚伯兰”表主的理性。这从“亚伯兰”的代表意义清楚可知。在前面两章，亚伯兰代表主，或祂童年时的状态；而在本章，他代表主的理性，这时被称作希伯来人亚伯兰，这从13节的论述和说明清楚可知。此处的代表意义也一样，因为除了希伯来人亚伯兰外，本章再没有提及其他亚伯兰。要与其内在人结合的主的属灵物是希伯来人亚伯兰；而要与其内在人结合的属天物则由麦基洗德来代表和表示，如前所述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1741.</strong> The symbolism of to Abram as the Lord's rational mind is established by the representation of Abram. In the last two chapters, Abram represented the Lord's state during youth. Here in the present chapter, Abram represents the Lord's rational mind, and in those circumstances he is called Abram the Hebrew, as the remarks and proofs above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1741/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>13</a> show [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1741/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1702" target=_top>1702-1703</a>]. He represents the same thing here because no other Abram is meant in this chapter than Abram the Hebrew.<br />The Lord's spiritual dimension (when connected to his inner self) is Abram the Hebrew, but his heavenly dimension (when connected to his inner self) is represented and symbolized by Melchizedek, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1741/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1725" target=_top>1725</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1741/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732" target=_top>1732</a>]. </p>

To Abram. That this signifies the Lord's rational, is evident from the representation of Abram. In the two chapters which precede, Abram represented the Lord or His state in childhood; here in this chapter, 
he represents the Lord's rational, and is then called "Abram the Hebrew;" as is evident from what has been said and shown above at verse 13; and here the representation is the same; for in this 
chapter no other Abram is meant than Abram the Hebrew. The Lord's spiritual which is adjoined to His internal man is Abram the Hebrew but the celestial which is adjoined to His internal man is represented 
and signified by Melchizedek, as before said. </p>

'To Abram' means the Lord's Rational. This is clear from the representation of 'Abram'. In the two previous chapters Abram represented the Lord, or His state in childhood, but in the present chapter 
he represents the Lord's Rational, and in this case he is called 'Abram the Hebrew', as is clear from what has been stated and shown above at verse 13. His representation here is the same, for no other 
Abram is meant in this chapter than 'Abram the Hebrew'. The Lord's Spiritual that was joined to the Internal Man is 'Abram the Hebrew', whereas His Celestial that was joined to the Internal Man was 
represented and meant by 'Melchizedek', as has been stated. </p>

</p><b>1741.</b>
'Ad Abramum':quod significet Rationale Domini, constat a repraesentatione 'Abrami'; in binis capitibus quae praecedunt, repraesentavit Abram Dominum seu statum Ipsius in pueritia, hic seu in hoc capite 
repraesentat Rationale Domini, et tunc appellatur 'Abram Hebraeus,' ut constat ab illis quae supra ad vers. 13 dicta et ostensa sunt; hic similiter, nam non alius Abram in hoc capite quam Abram Hebraeus 
intelligitur. Spirituale Domini quod adjunctum Interno Homini, est 'Abram Hebraeus,' at caeleste quod adjunctum Interno, hoc repraesentatum et significatum est per 'Malkizedech,' ut dictum. </p>
