<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4500节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4500.</strong>“不动声色地来到城中，把一切男丁都杀了”表他们灭绝了古人当中教会的教义真理。这从“城”、“不动声色”和“男丁”的含义清楚可知：“城”是指教会的教义（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4478.htm">4478</a>节）。在此是指古人当中的教会的教义，因为该教会由哈抹和示剑来代表，它就是他们的城；“不动声色”是指出于信靠，在此是指出于对虚假与邪恶的信靠；“男丁”（即男性）是指真理（<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，他们“不动声色地来到城中，把一切男丁都杀了”表示他们出于对虚假和邪恶的信靠而灭绝了古人当中教会的教义真理。<br />正是古人当中出身于上古教会的这个教会要建在雅各的后代的中间，因为古教会开始灭亡。但就内义而言，此处描述了以下事实：他们灭绝了自己里面的一切信之真理和一切仁之良善，因而灭绝了敬拜的一切内在，故教会不可能建在雅各的后代当中。这解释了纯粹的教会代表如何因他们的顽固坚持而建在他们中间（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>-<a href="4290.htm">4290</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4314.htm">4314</a>，<a href="4316.htm">4316</a>-<a href="4317.htm">4317</a>，<a href="4429.htm">4429</a>，<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>节）。</p>

And came upon the city boldly, and slew every male. That this signifies that they extirpated the truths of doctrine of the Church among the Ancients, is evident from the signification of a "city," as 
being the doctrine of the church (n. 402, 2449, 2943, 3216, 4478), here of the Church among the Ancients, because this church is represented by Hamor and Shechem, whose city it was; from the signification 
of "boldly," as being with assurance, here the assurance of what is false and evil; and from the signification of a "male," as being truth (n. 749, 2046, 4005). Hence it is evident that by "they 
came upon the city boldly and slew every male" is signified that from the assurance of falsity and evil they extirpated the truths of doctrine of the Church among the Ancients. It was the Church among 
the Ancients (that came from the Most Ancient Church) which would have been set up with the posterity of Jacob, because the Ancient Church had begun to perish; but it is here described in the internal 
sense that they extinguished in themselves all the truth of faith and good of charity, thus all the internal of worship, and that therefore no church could be instituted with that posterity; from which 
it came to pass that because they stubbornly insisted, the mere representative of a church was instituted with them (see n. 4281, 4288-4290, 4293, 4307, 4314, 4316-4317, 4429, 4433, 4444). </p>

'And came with confidence upon the city, and killed every male' means that they utterly destroyed the truths of doctrine of the Church among the Ancients. This is clear from the meaning of 'the city' 
as the doctrine of the Church, dealt with in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4478.htm">4478</a>, in this case of the Church among the Ancients, for that Church is represented by Hamor and Shechem whose city it was; from the 
meaning of 'with confidence' as with trust, in this case with trust in falsity and evil; and from the meaning of 'a male' as truth, dealt with in <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>, <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 
'they came with confidence upon the city, and killed every male' means that with a trust in falsity and evil they utterly destroyed the truths of doctrine of the Church among the Ancients. </p>

It was the Church among the Ancients, a descendant of the Most Ancient Church, that was going to be established among the descendants from Jacob, because the Ancient Church had begun to perish. But the 
fact that they utterly destroyed every truth of faith and good of charity, and thus every internal aspect of worship among them, and so the fact that no Church could be established among Jacob's descendants, 
is described at this point in the internal sense. This explains how it came about that, because of their stubborn insistence, that which was merely a representative of the Church was established 
among them <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>-<a href="4290.htm">4290</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>, <a href="4316.htm">4316</a>, <a href="4317.htm">4317</a>, <a href="4429.htm">4429</a>, <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>, <a href="4444.htm">4444</a>. </p>

`Et venerunt super urbem confidenter, et occiderunt omnem masculum': quod significet quod exstirparent vera doctrinae Ecclesiae apud antiquos, constat ex significatione `urbis' quod sit doctrina

quod sit ex fiducia, hic ex fiducia falsi et mali; et ex significatione `masculi' quod sit verum, de qua n. 749, 2046, 4005; inde patet quod per `venerunt super urbem confidenter et occiderunt omnem
