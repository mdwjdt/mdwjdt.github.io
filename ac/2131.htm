<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2131节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2131.</strong>被准许进入的人会被具有至内在的仁爱及其喜乐的天使社群接纳，一切爱和友谊也会向他们显明。但是，他们若不愿留在初次所到的社群，就会被其它社群所接纳，这一过程会反复进行，直到他们来到照着他们所拥有相爱的生命而与他们和谐一致的社群。他们会留在那里，直到他们因变得更加完善而离开，并从那里被提升和高举到更大的幸福中。这事出于主的怜悯，照着他们在世时所接受的爱与仁的生命而成就。不过，从一个社群转移到另一个社群从来不是因为他们被所在的社群拒绝，而是因为他们自己情愿离开，这种情愿取决于主注入到他们里面一种迫切的渴望。由于这种转移符合他们的愿望，故没有一事不是出于自由而成就的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2131</b></p><p><b>2131.</b>
Individuals who are being intromitted are received by the angelic societies with inmost charity and its joy, and all love and friendship are shown them. But when they do not willingly desire to be in 
the societies to which they first come, they are received by other societies, and this successively until they come to that society with which they are in agreement, in accordance with the life of mutual 
love which they have; and they remain there until the time when they go forth still more perfect, and are then elevated and exalted thereby into greater happiness-and this from the Lord's mercy, 
in accordance with the life of love and charity which they had received in the world. But the transference from one society into another never takes place by their being rejected by the society where 
they are, but by a certain willingness in themselves, in accordance with a longing that is insinuated into them by the Lord; and because it takes place in accordance with their longings, there is nothing 
that is not done from freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2131</b></p><p><b>2131.</b>
People who are admitted are received by angelic communities with inmost charity and its joy, and they are shown all love and friendship. But when they are no longer content to remain in the communities 
they have come to first, they are received by other communities, and this process is repeated again and again until they reach that community with which they accord so far as the life of mutual love 
with them is concerned, There they remain until, having become more perfect, they leave, and from there are raised and lifted up into greater happiness, which in the Lord's mercy happens to them to 
the extent that the life of love and charity which they have received in the world exists with them. But their transference from one community to another is never a matter of their being rejected by the 
community where they are. It takes place because they themselves wish to go, a wish that is in accordance with an urgent desire instilled in them by the Lord. And because that transference is in keeping 
with their desires there is nothing which is not done in freedom. </p>

</p><b>2131.</b>
Qui intromittuntur, a societatibus angelicis recipiuntur cum intima charitate et ejus gaudio, ac illis omnis amor et amicitia exhibetur; at dum in societatibus illis ad quas primum veniunt, non libenter 
esse volunt, tunc ab diis societatibus recipiuntur, et hoc successive usque dum ad (t)illam societatem veniunt cum qua concordant secundum vitam amoris mutui {1} quae illis, ac ibi manent tamdiu 
dum adhuc perfectiores evadunt, et inde tunc in majorem felicitatem elevantur et exaltantur, et hoc ex misericordia Domini secundum vitam amoris et charitatis quam in mundo receperunt: sed translatio 
ab una societate in alteram nusquam fit per rejectionem a societate ubi sunt, sed per voluntarium quoddam apud eos, secundum desiderium, quod illis insinuantur a Domino, et quia secundum desideria, nihil 
non fit ex libero. 	@1 sui.$ </p>
