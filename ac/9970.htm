<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9970节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9970.</strong>由于他们在大人，也就是天堂里面具有这种关系，还由于他们清清楚楚地看到下面的事物，所以在我们交谈的过程中，我还把他们比作在高空飞翔的老鹰，能环顾四周，对事物有一个清晰而广阔的视野。但这话令他们愤慨，他们以为我认为他们就像贪婪猎食的老鹰，因而认为他们是坏人。但我回答说，我不是把他们比作贪婪猎食的老鹰，而是比作具有敏锐视觉的老鹰；我补充说，像贪婪猎食的老鹰之人是坏人，但是，只像具有敏锐视觉的老鹰之人是好人。</p>

Because they bear this relation in the Grand Man, which is heaven, and as they clearly see the things which are below, in conversing with them I compared them to eagles, which fly to a great height, 
and look around with a sharp and far-reaching vision. But at this they were indignant, supposing that I believed them to be like eagles in respect to rapacity, and thus that they were evil. But I replied 
that I did not liken them to eagles in respect to rapacity, but in respect to their keenness of sight; adding that they who are like eagles in respect to rapacity are evil, but that they who are like 
them only in keenness of sight are good. </p>

Since that was what they correlated with in the Grand Man, which is heaven, and since they saw so clearly the things below, I also likened them during the course of our conversation to eagles flying 
high up, which look all around and have a clear and wide view of things. But they were distressed by this, supposing that I therefore thought them to be like eagles as birds of prey, thus that I thought 
them to be bad. But I replied that I was not likening them to eagles as birds of prey but as creatures with keen eyesight, adding that people who are like eagles as birds of prey are bad, but those 
who are like them only as creatures with keen eyesight are good.  </p>

Quia illi in Maximo Homine, quod est caelum, id referebant, et quia perspicaciter videbant quae infra erant, inter loquendum etiam comparabam illos cum aquilis quae alte volant, et perspicaciter et 
late circumspiciunt; sed ad haec indignati sunt, putantes quod ideo crederem illos aquilis similes quoad rapinam, et sic quod mali essent; sed respondebam quod non assimilarem illos aquilis quoad rapinam 
sed quoad aciem visus, addendo quod qui similes aquilis quoad rapinam sunt mali sint, at qui solum quoad aciem visus boni sint. </p>
