<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9826节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9826.</strong>“杂色的内袍”表直接从神性属天层发出、从至内在存在于那里的神性真理。这从“内袍”的含义清楚可知，“内袍”是指属世真理。但当论述的主题是亚伦，而亚伦的衣服代表主的属灵国度的真理（参看<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>，<a href="9822.htm">9822</a>节）时，“内袍”表示从至内在存在于这国度中的神性真理，因而表示从神性属天层，就是主在至内层天堂的神性良善最近发出之物（“内袍”表示这类事物，可参看<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>节）。因为天堂有三层，即：被称为属天层的至内层，被称为属灵层的中间层和接近属世之物的最低层。在至内层天堂掌权的，是对主之爱的良善，在中间天堂掌权的，是对邻之仁的良善，在最低天堂掌权的，是信之良善。这些天堂彼此完全不同，相互分离，以致在这一层天堂的，不可能过到另一层天堂去。然而，为使它们构成一个天堂，它们通过居间的天使社群联结起来；以这种方式一个天堂从另一个天堂发出。因此，由于亚伦的衣服代表属灵天堂，因而代表在其适当次序中的该天堂的真理，故显而易见，被称为“杂色内袍”的最里面的衣服代表那里直接从神性属天层发出的至内在真理。经上之所以说“杂色”，是因为它是一件织成的衣服，这从出埃及记后面的经文明显看出来：<br />他们用织工为亚伦和他的儿子作细麻布的内袍。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.27.htm">39:27</a>）<br />内袍由细麻布来做，是为了可以代表来自一个属天源头的真理；“细麻布”表示这种真理（参看<a href="9469.htm">9469</a>节）。</p>

And a tunic of checker work. That this signifies Divine truth there inmostly proceeding immediately from the Divine celestial, is evident from the signification of "a tunic," as being natural truth; 
but when said concerning Aaron, whose garments represented the truths of the Lord's spiritual kingdom (see n. 9814, 9822), "the tunic" denotes the inmost Divine truth in this kingdom, thus that which 
proceeds most nearly from the Divine celestial, which is the Lord's Divine good in the inmost heaven (that such things are signified by "tunics," see n. 4677). For there are three heavens-the inmost which 
is called celestial, the middle which is called spiritual, and the ultimate which approaches what is natural. In the inmost heaven reigns the good of love to the Lord, in the middle heaven the good 
of charity toward the neighbor, and in the ultimate heaven the good of faith. These heavens are most distinct one from another, insomuch that he who is in one heaven cannot possibly pass into another; 
and yet they are one heaven, being joined together by means of intermediate angelic societies; and in this way one heaven proceeds from another. As therefore the garments of Aaron represent the spiritual 
heaven, and thus the truths of this heaven in their order, it is evident that by the inmost garment, which is called "a tunic of checker work," is represented the inmost truth there which proceeds 
immediately from the Divine celestial. It is said to be "of checker work," because it was woven, as is evident from what follows in the book of Exodus: </p>
<p>     They made tunics of fine linen, the work 
of the weaver, for Aaron, and for his sons (Exod. 39:27); </p>
<p>that the tunics were of fine linen was in order that truth from a celestial origin might be represented. (That such truth is signified by 
"fine linen," see n. 9469.) </p>

'And a checkered tunic' means Divine Truth inmostly present there, emanating directly from the Divine Celestial. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tunic' as natural truth. But when the subject is 
Aaron, whose garments represented the forms of truth belonging to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, <a href="9814.htm">9814</a>, <a href="9822.htm">9822</a>, 'a tunic' means Divine Truth inmostly present in that kingdom, thus that which emanates from 
what is right next to it, namely the Divine Celestial, which is the Lord's Divine Good in the inmost heaven. The fact that such things are meant by 'tunics', see <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>. For the heavens are three - the 
inmost, which is called celestial; the middle, which is called spiritual; and the lowest, which approaches what is natural. In the inmost heaven the good of love to the Lord is predominant, in the middle 
one the good of charity towards the neighbour, and in the lowest the good of faith. Those heavens are completely distinct and separate from one another, so much so that nobody in one can possibly 
pass over into the next. Yet in order that they may still make one heaven they are joined together by means of intermediate angelic communities; in this way one heaven leads on from another. Since therefore 
Aaron's garments represent the spiritual heaven, and so the forms of truth there in their proper order, it is evident that the inmost garment, called 'a checkered tunic', represents the truth 
inmostly present there, emanating directly from the Divine Celestial. The word 'checkered' is used because it was a woven garment, as is clear from what follows later on in the Book of Exodus,  </p>

`Et tunicam tesselatam': quod (x)significet Divinum Verum ibi intime procedens immediate a Divino Caelesti, constat ex significatione `tunicae' quod sit verum naturale, at cum de Aharone, cujus vestes 
repraesentabant vera regni spiritualis Domini, n. 9814, (x)9822, est tunica Divinum Verum intimum in illo regno, ita quod proxime procedit ex Divino Caelesti, quod est Divinum Bonum Domini in caelo 
intimo; quod talia per `tunicas' significentur, videatur n. 4677; caeli enim sunt tres, intimum quod vocatur caeleste, medium quod spirituale, et ultimum quod accedit ad naturale; in intimo caelo regnat 
bonum amoris in Dominum, in medio bonum charitatis erga proximum, et in (x)ultimo bonum fidei; illi caeli inter se distinctissimi sunt, usque adeo ut qui in uno nequaquam transire possit in alterum; 
{1}ut tunc unum caelum sint, conjunguntur per angelicas societates intermedias; ita procedit unum caelum ab altero; cum itaque vestes Aharonis repraesentant caelum spirituale, ac ita vera ibi in suo 
ordine, patet quod per intimam vestem, quae vocatur tunica tesselata, repraesentetur verum ibi intimum procedens immediate a Divino Caelesti; `tesselata' dicitur quia erat texta, ut constat (c)a sequentibus 
in Libro Exodi, 	Fecerunt tunicas {2}byssi, opus textoris, pro Aharone et pro filiis ejus, xxxix 27; </p>
<p>quod ex {3}bysso, erat causa ut repraesentaretur verum ex origine caelesti; quod id verum 
per {4}'byssum' significetur, videatur n. 9469. @1 qui at unum coelum sunt: IT$ @2 byssini$ @3 byssino$ @4 byssinum$ </p>
