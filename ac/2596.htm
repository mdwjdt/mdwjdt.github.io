<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2596节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2596.</strong>一日清晨，我听到从远处传来和声。从这和声所表现的代表物，我判断他们是中国人，因为它们显现为一种毛山羊、小米糕、象牙勺和一座浮城的形像。他们渴望走近我，并来到我身边，声称想和我单独谈谈，以透露他们的想法。但是他们被告知，我们无以独处，这对别人是一种冒犯，因为他们只是客人。当发觉这是对别人的冒犯时，他们开始反思自己是不是得罪了邻人，是不是将他人之物据为己有（在来世，一切想法都是共通的）。我得以觉察到他们心中的不安，这种不安包含他们对自己或许对他人造成伤害的承认，也包含由此而来的羞愧，连同其它诚实的情感。其仁爱的心肠，由此可见一斑。此后不久，我与他们交谈，最后提到了主。当我称主为“基督”时，我感觉到一种抵触情绪。原来，他们在世时，发现基督徒过着败坏的生活，缺乏仁爱的心肠，还不如他们。后来，当我简单地称主为“主”时，他们却深受感动。之后，天使告诉他们，其实基督教比世上的任何宗教更要求仁爱，只可惜照此而行的人少之又少。</p>

One morning there was a choir at a distance from me, and it was given me to know from the representations of the choir that they were Chinese; for they presented a kind of woolly goat, a cake of millet, 
and an ivory spoon, as also the idea of a floating city. They desired to come nearer to me; and when they had applied themselves they said that they desired to be alone with me, that they might open 
their thoughts. But they were told that they were not alone, and that there were others who were indignant at their desiring to be alone, when yet they were guests. When they perceived the indignation 
of the others, they began to think whether they had trespassed against the neighbor, and whether they had claimed anything for themselves that belonged to others. (In the other life all thoughts are 
communicated.) I was permitted to perceive their trouble: it was that of an acknowledgment that perhaps they had wronged the others, and of shame on that account, and of other good affections at the 
same time, from which it was known that they were endued with charity. Presently I spoke with them, and at length about the Lord. When I called Him Christ, a kind of repugnance was perceived in them; 
but the cause was discovered to be that they brought this repugnance from the world, from their having known Christians to live worse than they did themselves, and in no charity. But when I simply called 
Him the Lord, they were inwardly moved. They were afterwards instructed by the angels that beyond every other doctrine in the whole world the Christian doctrine prescribes love and charity, but 
that there are but few persons who live in accordance with it. </p>

One morning there was a choir at a distance from me. From the representational objects presented by this choir I was given to know that they were Chinese, for those objects were - a variety of woolly 
goat, also a cake made of millet, and an ivory spoon, and the idea as well of a floating city. They desired to come nearer to me, and when they had joined me said that they would like to be alone with 
me so that they might reveal their thoughts. They were told however that they were not alone, and that others were present who were annoyed with them for so wishing to be alone when they were but guests. 
On perceiving this annoyance in the others they began to wonder whether they had sinned against the neighbour and whether they had laid claim to something which belonged to others. (In the next 
life all thoughts are communicated.) I was given to perceive their disturbance of mind. It consisted of a recognition that they had perhaps done harm to those others and also of shame on that account, 
together with other right affections, from all of which one was made aware that they were endowed with charity. Soon after this I spoke to them, and at length about the Lord. When I called Him Christ 
I perceived a certain revulsion on their part; but the reason for that revulsion was found to lie in the fact that they had brought it from the world, where they had acquired it from their having known 
Christians who led worse lives than themselves and had no charity. But when I simply called Him Lord they were inwardly moved. They were then informed by angels that Christian teaching more than any 
other in all the world enjoins love and charity, but that there are few who live according to that teaching. </p>

Unus chorus ad distantiam a me fuit quodam mane; ex chori repraesentationibus cognoscere datum quod essent Chinenses, sistebant enim speciem hirci lanati, tum placentam ex miliis, et cochleare ebenum, 
ut et ideam urbis natatilis; desiderabant proprius ad me venire, et cum se applicarent, dicebant quod soli apud me esse vellent, ut sua cogitata aperirent; sed dicebatur eis quod soli non essent, et 
quod alii, qui indignantur quod soli esse vellent, cum tamen hospites; indignatione eorum percepta, in cogitationem lapsi sunt num praevaricati sint contra proximum et num quicquam sibi vindicaverint 
quod aliorum esset: (cogitationes in altera vita omnes communicantur:) commotionem eorum percipere datum; erat agnitionis quod forte eos laeserint, tum pudoris inde, et una aliarum affectionum probarum, 
inde quod charitate essent praediti, cognoscebatur: mox locutus cum illis, tandem etiam de Domino, eum Ipsum nominarem Christum, repugnantia quaedam apud eos percepta est, sed causa detegebatur quod 
traxerint id e mundo, ex eo quod noverint Christianos pejus vivere quam illi, et in nulla charitate; at cum Dominum simpliciter nominarem, tunc interius commoti sunt: instruebantur dein ab angelis 
quod Christiana doctrina prae omni alia in universo orbe amorem et charitatem praescribat, sed quod pauci sint qui secundum illam vivunt. </p>
