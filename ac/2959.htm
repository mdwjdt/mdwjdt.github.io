<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2959节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2959.</strong>“值四百舍客勒银子的一块地”表藉着真理的救赎的代价。这从“四百舍客勒”和“银子”的含义清楚可知：“四百舍客勒”的含义在下文有所论述；“银子”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>节）。“四百舍客勒”表救赎的代价，这是因为“四百”表荒凉或消磨，“舍客勒” 表价钱。至于何为荒凉（vastation），可参看前文（<a href="2455.htm">2455</a>，<a href="2682.htm">2682</a>，<a href="2694.htm">2694</a>，<a href="2699.htm">2699</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="2704.htm">2704</a>节），那里说明，荒凉分为两种。当一个教会完全灭亡，也就是说，仁或信不复存在时，第一种荒凉就会发生；这时，就说这个教会荒凉了或荒废了。当那些属于该教会的人陷入无知和试探的状态时，第二种就会发生，好使他们所具有的邪恶与虚假能被分离出去，仿佛消散。那些从这种荒凉当中出来的人被特称为赎民，因为那时，他们被教导信之良善与真理，并被主改造和重生，如所引用的章节所说明的。四百这个数字若用来标明具体时间，如四百年，就表示荒凉的持续时间和状态。所以，这个数字若用来标明舍客勒的数目，就表示救赎的代价。当“银子”这个词和这个数字一起被提及时，就表示藉着真理的救赎的代价。 <br />“四百年”表荒凉的持续时间和状态，这也可从论述亚伯拉罕的话看出来：<br />耶和华对亚伯兰说，你要确实知道，你的种必寄居在别人的地，服事他们；这些人要苦待他们四百年。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.13.htm">15:13</a>）<br />此处“四百年”看似表示以色列人待在埃及的时间，其实并不是，而是表示只能通过内义才能显明给人的某种事物。这从以下事实明显可知：以色列人待在埃及的时间其实只有上述时间的一半，从雅各直到摩西这几代人就能清楚看出来这一点。因为事实是，利未是雅各的后代，哥辖是利未的后代，暗兰是哥辖的后代，亚伦和摩西是暗兰的后代（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.16.htm">6:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.20.htm">20</a>）。利未和他的儿子哥辖随雅各下到埃及（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.11.htm">46:11</a>）；摩西是此后的第二代，他与法老对话时年八十岁（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.7.htm">7:7</a>）。这些事实表明，从雅各进入埃及直到他的子孙离开那地这段时间大约是215年。<br />在圣言中，“四百”表示某种其它事物，而非历史意义上的数值。这从以下经文看得更清楚： <br />以色列人住在埃及共有四百三十年。正当四百三十年终了的这一天，耶和华的军队都从埃及地出来了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.40.htm">12:40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.41.htm">41</a>）<br />以色列人待在那地的时间其实只有这个年数的一半，四百三十年是从亚伯拉罕进入埃及时算起的。所以，在这一点上，经上在出埃及记中是为了隐藏在这些话里面的内义才这么说的。就内义而言，雅各的子孙寄居埃及代表并表示教会的荒凉，而“四百三十年”这个数字则描述了这种荒凉的状态和持续时间。“三十”描述了雅各子孙的荒凉状态，它根本算不上荒凉，因为他们是无法通过任何荒凉或消磨的状态接受改造的那种人（关于数字三十的含义，可参看<a href="2276.htm">2276</a>节）。“四百年”则代表那些属于这个教会的人总体上荒凉的状态。<br />因此，凡从这种荒凉当中出来的人都被称为“赎民”，这也可从对摩西所说的这些话明显看出来：<br />所以你要对以色列人说：我是耶和华，我要把你们从埃及人的重担底下领出来，我要拯救你们脱离他们的奴役，我要用伸出来的膀臂，并藉着严厉的刑罚来救赎你们。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.6.htm">6:6</a>）<br /><br />耶和华用大能的手领你们出来，从为奴之家救赎你们脱离埃及王法老的手。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.8.htm">7:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申13.5.htm">13:5</a>）<br />还有：<br />要记念你在埃及地作过奴仆，耶和华你的神将你救赎。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.15.htm">15:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申24.18.htm">24:18</a>）<br />撒母耳记：<br />你从埃及救赎他们作你的子民。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下7.23.htm">7:23</a>）<br />由于那些从荒凉的状态当中出来的人被称为“赎民”，故“四百舍客勒”表示救赎的代价。<br />“舍客勒”表代价或估价，这从以下圣言经文明显看出来。摩西书：<br />你的一切估价，都要按着圣所的舍客勒。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利27.25.htm">27:25</a>）<br /><br />若有灵魂在耶和华的圣物上误犯了罪，有了过犯，他就要照你所估的价，按圣所的舍客勒拿几舍客勒银子，将羊群中一只没有残疾的公绵羊，牵到耶和华面前为赎愆祭。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.15.htm">5:15</a>）<br />从这些经文明显可知，“舍客勒”表代价或估价。经上之所以说“圣所的舍客勒”，是因为代价或估价和来自主的真理与良善有关；在教会中，来自主的真理与良善是神圣本身。因此，它在其它地方也被称为“圣所的舍客勒”（如出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.24.htm">30:24</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利27.3.htm">27:3</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.47.htm">3:47</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.50.htm">50</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.13.htm">7:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.43.htm">43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.49.htm">49</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.55.htm">55</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.61.htm">61</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.67.htm">67</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.73.htm">73</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.16.htm">18:16</a>）。<br />“舍客勒”表圣物的价值，这明显可见于以西结书，那里论述了圣地和圣城。论及舍客勒，那里说：<br />舍客勒是二十季拉。二十舍客勒，二十五舍客勒，十五舍客勒，为你们的弥那。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.12.htm">45:12</a>）<br />谁都能看出，此处“舍客勒”、“弥那”，以及所提到的数字均表示圣物，也就是良善与真理。因为圣地和圣城，那里所论述的新耶路撒冷只表示主的国度，主的国度既不会有舍客勒、季拉，也不会有弥那，以及它们的计量。数字本身因其在内义上的含义而决定了良善与真理的估价或价值。<br />摩西书：<br />他们各人要为自己的性命交赎价，免得有疫病。他要按圣所的舍客勒，付半舍客勒，一舍客勒是二十季拉，这半舍客勒是献给耶和华的礼物。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.12.htm">30:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处十季拉，也就是半舍客勒，表示来自主的余留。余留就是储存在人身上的良善与真理，这类余留由“十”来表示（参看<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节）。余留就是储存在人身上的来自主的良善与真理（参看<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节）。因此，它们还被称为“献给耶和华的礼物”，经上说要以它们为性命的赎价。经上之所以数次提及一舍客勒是二十季拉（如上述经文，以及利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利27.25.htm">27:25</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.47.htm">3:47</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.16.htm">18:16</a>等），是因为二十季拉的一舍客勒表示保存在余留中的良善的价值，二十表保存在余留中的良善（参看<a href="2280.htm">2280</a>节）。鉴于这个原因，一舍客勒也是一个确定金银价值的重量（参看创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.22.htm">24:22</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.24.htm">38:24</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.10.htm">4:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出45.12.htm">45:12</a>）。金子有价值，是因为“金”表良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）；银子有价值，是因为“银”表真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节）。由此明显可知，“值四百舍客勒银子的一块地”表藉着真理的救赎的代价。它之所以被称为“地”，是因为所论述的主题是属灵教会，该教会藉着从主所接受的真理而被改造和重生（<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）。“地”表教会（参看<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a

Land of four hundred shekels of silver. That this signifies the price of redemption by means of truth, is evident from the signification of "four hundred shekels" (concerning which presently); and from 
the signification of "silver" as being truth (see n. 1551, 2048, 2937). That "four hundred shekels" signifies the price of redemption, is because "four hundred" signifies vastation; and "shekel" signifies 
the price. What vastation is may be seen above (n. 2455, 2682, 2694, 2699, 2701, 2704), namely, that it is twofold; of one kind when a church altogether perishes, that is, when there is no longer 
any charity or faith, and when it is said to be "devastated" or laid waste;" and of the other kind when they who are of the church are reduced to a state of ignorance, and also of temptation, in order 
that the evils and falsities with them may be separated and as it were dispersed. They who emerge from this kind of vastation are they who are specifically called the redeemed, for they are then 
instructed in the goods and truths of faith, and are reformed and regenerated by the Lord (concerning whom see the passages cited). Now whereas "four hundred" when predicated of time, as "four hundred 
years," signifies the duration and state of vastation, so when predicated of shekels it signifies the price of redemption; and when mention is made of silver at the same time, there is signified the 
price of redemption by means of truth. [2] That "four hundred years" signifies the duration and state of vastation, may also be seen from what was said to Abram: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Abram, Knowing 
thou shalt know that thy seed shall be a sojourner in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years (Gen. 15:13); </p>
<p>where it seems that by "four hundred 
years" is meant the stay of the sons of Israel in Egypt. But that their stay in Egypt is not what is signified, but something else which is not manifest to anyone except from the internal sense, is 
evident from the fact that the stay of the sons of Israel in Egypt was but half of that time; as is clearly evident from the generations from Jacob to Moses; for from Jacob came Levi; from Levi, Kohath; 
from Kohath, Amram; and from Amram, Aaron and Moses (Exod. 6:16-20). Levi and his son Kohath came with Jacob into Egypt (Gen. 46:11); Moses was of the second generation after this, and he was eighty 
years old when he spoke to Pharaoh (Exod. 7:7); from all which it is evident that from the coming of Jacob into Egypt to the going forth of his sons                                    was about two 
hundred and fifteen years. [3] It is still further evident that by "four hundred" in the Word something else is signified than what is meant by the number itself in the historic sense, from its being 
said: </p>
<p>The dwelling of the sons of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years; and it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, in the selfsame day it came to 
pass that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt (Exod. 12:40-41); </p>
<p>when nevertheless the stay of the sons of Israel there was but half that number of years; but it was four hundred 
and thirty years counting from Abraham's entrance into Egypt; and therefore it was so said for the sake of the internal sense that lies concealed in the words. In the internal sense, by the sojourning 
of the sons of Jacob in Egypt is represented and signified the vastation of the church; the state and duration of which is described by the number "four hundred and thirty years"; by "thirty" the 
state of vastation of Jacob's sons, that it was none at all, because they were such that they could not be reformed by any state of vastation (concerning the signification of the number thirty, see n. 
2276); and by "four hundred years," the general state of vastation of those who were of the church. [4] Therefore they who go forth from this vastation are they who are called the "redeemed" as is also 
plain from the words spoken to Moses: </p>
<p>     Wherefore say unto the sons of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt, and I will deliver you from their bondage, 
and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments (Exod. 6:6).      Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of servants, from the hand of 
Pharaoh king of Egypt (Deut. 7:8; 13:5).      Thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, but Jehovah thy God redeemed thee (Deut. 15:15; 24:18). In Samuel: </p>
<p>     Thy people 
whom thou hast redeemed to thee out of Egypt (2 Sam. 7:23). Because those who emerge from the state of vastation are called the "redeemed," therefore by "four hundred shekels" is signified the price 
of redemption. [5] That a "shekel" signifies the price or estimation is evident from the following passages in the Word; in Moses: </p>
<p>     And all thy estimation shall be in the shekel of the holiness 
(Lev. 27:25). And in another place: </p>
<p>     When a soul hath committed a trespass, and sinned in error from the holy things of Jehovah, he shall bring his guilt offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish 
out of the flock, according to thy estimation, in silver of shekels, after the shekel of holiness (Lev. 5:15). From these passages it is plain that by a "shekel" is signified the price or estimation. 
It is said the "shekel of holiness," because the price or estimation has regard to truth and good from the Lord; and truth and good from the Lord are the holy itself in the church. For this reason 
it is called the "shekel of holiness" in other places also (as in Exod. 30:24; Lev. 27:3; Num. 3:47, 50; 7:13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73; 18:16). [6] That the "shekel" denotes the price 
of what is holy, is clearly evident in Ezekiel, where the Holy Land and the Holy City are treated of. It is there said of the shekel: </p>
<p>     The shekel shall there be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five 
and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh [pound] (Ezek. 45:12); </p>
<p>that here by "shekel," and by "pound," and by the numbers, are signified holy things, that is, good and truth, anyone 
can see; for the Holy Land, and the Holy City in it (or the New Jerusalem there treated of) is no other than the kingdom of the Lord, where neither shekel nor gerah nor pound, nor the counting by them, 
but the number itself, from its signification in the internal sense, determines the estimation or the price of what is good and what is true. [7] In Moses: </p>
<p>     They shall give every man an expiation 
for his soul lest there should be a plague, half a shekel, after the shekel of holiness: the shekel is twenty gerahs and the half shekel for a therumah [an oblation] to Jehovah (Exod. 30:12-13); </p>
<p>where 
ten gerahs, which are the "half shekel," denote the remains which are from the Lord. (Remains are goods and truths stored up with man, and these are signified by "ten," as may be seen above, 
n. 576, 1738, 1906, 2284; and also that remains are goods and truths from the Lord stored up with man, n. 1906, 2284). These therefore are called an "oblation to Jehovah," and it is said that by them 
there shall be an expiation for the soul. The reason why it is so often said that the shekel was twenty gerahs (as in the passages quoted, and also in Lev. 27:25; Num. 3:47; 18:16, and elsewhere) is that 
the "shekel which is twenty gerahs" signifies the estimation of the good of remains (that "twenty" signifies the good of remains may be seen above, n. 2280). On this account the shekel was likewise 
a weight, according to which the value both of gold and of silver was estimated (see Gen. 24:22; Exod. 38:24; Ezek. 4:10; 45:12); the value of gold, because "gold" signifies good (n. 113, 1551, 1552); 
and of silver, because "silver" signifies truth (n. 1551, 2048). From all this it is now plain that by "land of four hundred shekels of silver" is signified the price of redemption by means of truth. 
It is called "land" because the subject is the spiritual church, which is reformed and regenerated by means of truth from the Lord (n. 2954). (That by "land" is signified the church, may be seen above, 
n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 at the end.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2959</b></p><p><b>2959.</b>
'The land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver' means the price of redemption by means of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'four hundred shekels', dealt with below, and from the meaning 
of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>. The reason 'four hundred shekels' means the price of redemption is that 'four hundred' means vastation and 'a shekel' price. What vastation is, see <a href="2455.htm">2455</a> (end), <a href="2682.htm">2682</a>, <a href="2694.htm">2694</a>, <a href="2699.htm">2699</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="2704.htm">2704</a>, where it is shown that there are two types of vastation. The first takes place when the Church altogether ceases to exist, that is, when there is no longer 
any charity or faith. At that point the Church is said to be vastated or laid waste. The second takes place when those who belong to the Church are reduced to a state of ignorance and also of temptation, 
for the reason that the evils and falsities residing with them are to be set apart and so to speak dissipated. Those who emerge from this vastation are those who are specifically called the redeemed, 
for at that point they are taught the goods and truths of faith, and are reformed and regenerated by the Lord, as shown in the paragraphs quoted. Now since the number four hundred, when used to specify 
a period of time - such as four hundred years - means the duration and also the state of vastation, so that same number, when used to specify the number of shekels, means the price of redemption; 
and when the word 'silver' is mentioned together with this number, the price of redemption by means of truth is meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'four hundred years' means the duration and the state of vastation 
becomes clear also from what Abraham was told, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Abraham,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Know for sure that your seed will be strangers in a land not theirs. And they will serve them, and these will afflict them for 
four hundred years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>There it may be seen that 'four hundred years' is used to mean the duration of the stay of the children of Israel in Egypt. Yet it is not the duration of their stay 
in Egypt that is meant but something that is not evident to anyone except from the internal sense. This becomes clear from the fact that the duration of the stay of the children of Israel in Egypt 
was no more than half the stated period, as becomes quite clear from the descendants of Jacob down to Moses. For the facts are that Levi was descended from Jacob, Kohath from Levi, Amram from Kohath, 
and Aaron and Moses from Amram, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:16-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:16-20</a>; Levi and his son Kohath went down to Egypt together with Jacob, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2046:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 46:11</a>; and Moses came two generations later, and was eighty years old when he spoke 
to Pharaoh, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%207:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 7:7</a>. These facts show that the period of time from Jacob's entry into Egypt until his sons' departure from that land was approximately two hundred and fifteen years. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'four 
hundred' is used in the Word to mean something other than its numerical value in the historical sense is clearer still from its being said that </p>
<blockquote>
The length of time that the children of Israel dwelt 
in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years, and at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, it happened on that same day, that all the armies of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:40</a>, 
<a href="41.htm">41</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The duration of the stay of the children of Israel in that land was in fact only half that number of years; but it was from Abraham's entry into Egypt that the four hundred and thirty years 
were measured. Consequently what is said at this point in Exodus is for the sake of the internal sense Lying within those words. In the internal sense the sojourn of the sons of Jacob in Egypt represents 
and means the vastation of the Church, the state and duration of which are described by the number four hundred and thirty years. Thirty describes the state of vastation of the sons of Jacob as being 
no vastation at all, for they were such as could not be reformed through any state of vastation (for the meaning of the number thirty, see <a href="2276.htm">2276</a>); and 'four hundred years' represents the general state 
of vastation of those who belonged to the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those therefore who come out of that vastation are referred to as the redeemed, as is also evident from the words addressed to Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore 
say to the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from beneath the burdens of Egypt, and I will rescue you from their slavery, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, 
and with great judgements. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has brought you out by means of a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of slaves, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:8;%2013:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:8; 13:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, but Jehovah your God redeemed you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2015:15;%2024:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 15:15; 24:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
Your people whom You redeemed 
for Yourself from Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%207:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 7:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Since those who emerge from the state of vastation are referred to as the redeemed, 'four hundred shekels' therefore means the price of redemption.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
As regards 'a shekel' meaning the price or valuation, this is clear from the following places in the Word: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of holiness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2027:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 27:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
If a soul commits a trespass and has sinned inadvertently in the holy things of Jehovah, he shall bring his guilt offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according 
to your valuation in silver shekels, according to the shekel of holiness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%205:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 5:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is evident that 'a shekel' means the price or valuation. It is called 'the shekel of holiness' 
because the price or valuation has regard to truth and good from the Lord - truth and good from the Lord being, within the Church, holiness itself. Consequently it is called 'the shekel of holiness' 
many times elsewhere, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2030:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 30:24</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2027:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 27:3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%203:47,%2050;%207:13,%2019,%2025,%2031,%2037,%2043,%2049,%2055,%2061,%2067,%2073;%2018:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 3:47, 50; 7:13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73; 18:16</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'a shekel' is the price of what is holy is quite evident in Ezekiel 
when the holy land and the holy city are the subject. There the shekel is referred to as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
The shekel there shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, fifteen shekels, shall 
be your maneh (pound). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that here 'shekel', 'pound', and the numbers mentioned mean holy things, that is, good and truth, for the holy land and the holy city or new Jerusalem, 
which are the subject there, mean nothing else than the Lord's kingdom where neither shekel, nor gerahs, nor pound, nor the numbering of them occurs. But the number itself, from the meaning it 
has in the internal sense, determines the valuation or price of good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Moses it is said that every man (vir) should give a ransom for his soul, so that there would be no plague. He 
had to give half a shekel, according to the shekel of holiness, a shekel being twenty gerahs. Half a shekel was to be the thruma (offering) to Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2030:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 30:12, 13</a>. Here ten gerahs, which make half 
a shekel, are remnants which are received from the Lord. Remnants are goods and truths stored away with a person - such remnants, being meant by 'ten', see <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>. That remnants are 
goods and truths from the Lord that are stored away with a person, see <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>. Consequently they are also called 'the thruma (or offering) to Jehovah', and it is said that by means of this a soul 
will be redeemed. The reason it is stated several times that a shekel was twenty gerahs, as in these verses from Exodus, and also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2027:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 27:25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%203:47;%2018:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 3:47; 18:16</a>; and elsewhere, is that the shekel of 
twenty gerahs means the valuation of the good preserved in remnants - twenty meaning the good preserved in remnants, see <a href="2280.htm">2280</a>. Also therefore a shekel was a weight according to which the price of both 
gold and silver was determined, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24:22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2038:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 38:24</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%204:10;%2045:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 4:10; 45:12</a> the price of gold because 'gold' means good, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, and the price of silver because 'silver' means truth, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>. 
From this it is now evident that 'the land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver' means the price of redemption by means of truth. The reason it is called 'the land' is that the spiritual Church 
is the subject, which is reformed and regenerated by means of truth received from the Lord, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>. That 'the land' means the Church, see <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end).

`Terra quadringentorum siclorum argenti':  quod significet pretium redemptionis per verum, constat a significatione `quadringentorum siclorum' de qua sequitur, et a significatione `argenti' quod sit 
verum, de qua n. 1551, 2048, 2937.  Quod `quadringenti sicli' significent redemptionis pretium, inde est quia `quadringenta' significant vastationem, et `siclus' pretium; quid vastatio, videatur n. 2455 
f., 2682, 2694, 2699, 2702, 2704, quod nempe sit duplex, una, cum Ecclesia prorsus perit, hoc est, cum amplius nulla charitas aut fides, tunc dicitur vastata seu vasta; altera, cum illi qui ab Ecclesia, 
in statum ignorantiae et quoque tentationis rediguntur, ob causam ut mala et falsa apud illos separentur et quasi discutiantur; {1}qui e vastatione hac emergunt, ii sunt qui in specie vocantur 
redempti, nam tunc instruuntur in bonis et veris fidei ac reformantur et regenerantur a Domino, de quibus in locis citatis: quia nunc `quadringenta' cum praedicantur de tempore, ut quadringenti anni, 
significant vastationis durationem et statum, ita cum quadringenta praedicantur de siclis, significant redemptionis pretium, et cum nominatur simul argentum, significant redemptionis pretium per verum. 
 [2] Quod `quadringenti anni' significent vastationis durationem et statum, etiam constare potest ab illis quae dicta sunt ad Abrahamum,           Jehovah dixit Abrahamo, Cognoscendo cognosces, quod 
      peregrinum erit semen tuum in terra, non illis, et servient      illis, et affligent illos quadringentis annis, Gen. xv 13; </p>
<p>ubi {2}videatur quod per `quadringentos annos' intelligatur duratio 
filiorum Israelis in Aegypto; sed quod non duratio illorum in Aegypto sit quae significatur, sed quod aliquid quod non patet alicui nisi ex sensu interno, constare potest inde quod duratio filiorum 
Israelis in Aegypto non fuerit nisi {3}dimidium illius temporis, ut manifeste constare potest ex nativitatibus {4}Jacobi ad Mosen; ex Jacobo enim erat Levi, ex Levi Kehath, ex Kehath Amram, et ex Amram 
Aaron et Moses, Exod. vi 16-20; Levi et ejus filius Kehath venerunt cum Jacobo in Aegyptum, Gen. xlvi 11, ex altera inde generatione erat Moses, et Moses octoginta annis cum locutus ad Pharaonem, Exod. 
vii 7; inde constare potest quod ab ingressu Jacobi ad exitum filiorum ejus{5}, fuerint circiter ducenti quindecim anni:  [3] adhuc magis constare potest quod per `quadringenta' in Verbo aliud intelligatur 
quam quod per ipsum numerum in sensu historico, ex eo quod dicatur,           Quod habitatio filiorum Israelis, qua habitarunt in       Aegypto, fuerint triginta anni et quadringenti anni; 
et factum      a fine triginta annorum et quadringentorum annorum, et factum      in eodem die hoc exiverunt omnes exercitus Jehovae e terra      Aegypti, Exod. xii 40, 41: </p>
<p>cum tamen duratio filiorum 
Israelis ibi modo fuerit dimidium illorum annorum, sed quod ab Abrahami ingressu in Aegyptum fuerint triginta et quadringenti anni, quare ita dictum propter sensum internum qui latet in illis verbis; 
in sensu interno per peregrinationem filiorum Jacobi in Aegypto repraesentatur et significatur Ecclesiae vastatio, cujus status et duratio describitur per numerum triginta et quadringentorum annorum, 
per `triginta' status vastationis filiorum Jacobi, quod nulla fuerit, quia tales ut non per aliquem statum vastationis reformari potuerint; de significatione numeri triginta {6}videatur n. 2276; 
et per `quadringentos annos' status vastationis communis illorum qui ab Ecclesia:  [4] qui itaque a vastatione illa exeunt, illi sunt qui dicuntur redempti, quod etiam patet a verbis ad Mosen, 		Propterea 
dic filiis Israelis, Ego 	Jehovah, et educam vos a sub oneribus Aegypti, et liberabo vos a 	servitute illorum, et redimam vos brachio extenso et judiciis magnis, Exod. vi 6: </p>
<p>et alibi,      
     Eduxit Jehovah vos per manum fortem, et redemit te e       domo servorum, e manu Pharaonis regis Aegypti, Deut. vii 8; </p>
<p>     xiii 6 [A.V. 5]: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Memineris quod servus fueris in 
terra Aegypti, sed       redemit te Jehovah Deus tuus, Deut. xv 15; xxiv 18: </p>
<p>apud Samuelem,           Populus tuus quem redemisti Tibi ex Aegypto, 2 Sam. vii      23:   quia illi qui emergunt a 
statu vastationis dicuntur redempti, ideo per `quadringentos siclos' significatur redemptionis pretium. [5] Quod `siclus' significat pretium seu aestimationem, constat ex his locis in Verbo; apud Mosen,  
         Omnis aestimatio tua erit in siclo sanctitatis, Lev. xxvii 25:  et alibi,           Anima cum praevaricata praevaricationem, et peccavit       errore de sanctis Jehovae, et adducet reatum 
suum Jehovae,      arietem integrum e grege, in aestimatione tua, argento      siclorum, in siclo sanctitatis, Lev. v 15; </p>
<p>inde patet quod per `siclum' significetur pretium seu aestimatio; siclus 
sanctitatis dicitur, quia pretium seu aestimatio spectat verum et bonum a Domino, verum et bonum a Domino est ipsum sanctum in Ecclesia; inde dicitur `siclus sanctitatis,' etiam pluries alibi, ut 
Exod. xxx 24; Lev. xxvii 3; Num. iii 47, 50; vii 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73; xviii 16. [6] Quod `siclus' sit pretium sancti, manifeste patet apud Ezechielem, ubi agitur de terra sancta 
et de civitate sancta; ibi ita de siclo dicitur,           Siclus ibi viginti gerae, viginti sicli, quinque et       viginti sicli, quindecim sicli, maneh (libra:) erit vobis, xlv      12; </p>
<p>quod ibi 
per `siclum,' et per `libram,' et per `numeros' significentur sancta, hoc est, bonum et verum, quisque videre potest, `terra enim sancta,' et `civitas sancta' ibi, seu nova Hierosolyma, de qua ibi 
agitur, non aliud est quam regnum Domini, ubi nec siclus, nec gerae, nec libra, nec numeratio per illa, sed ipse numerus ex significatione in sensu interno determinat aestimationem seu pretium boni et 
veri:  [7] apud Mosen,           Quod vir daret expiationem animae suae,...ne esset       plaga,...dimidium sicli in siclo sanctitatis, viginti gerae      siclus, et quod dimidium sicli esset {7}terumah 
(sublatio)      Jehovae, Exod. xxx 12, 13:   ibi `decem gerae' quae dimidium sicli, sunt reliquiae quae a Domino; reliquiae sunt bona et vera apud hominem recondita, quae quod significentur per 
`decem,' videatur n. 576, 1738, 1906, 2284; quod reliquiae sint bona et vera a Domino apud hominem recondita, n. 1906, 2284, quare etiam vocantur `terumah' seu sublatio Jehovae, et dicitur quod `per 
illa erit expiatio animae'; causa quod aliquoties dicatur quod `siclus esset viginti gerae,' ut in loco citato, tum Lev. xxvii 25; Num. iii 47; xviii 16, et alibi, est quia siclus viginti gerae significat 
aestimationem boni reliquiarum, quod `viginti' sint bonum reliquiarum, videatur n. 2280; ideo quoque siclus erat pondus, secundum quod pretium tam auri quam argenti, Gen. xxiv 22; Exod. xxxviii 
24; Ezech. iv 10; xlv 12, pretium auri, quia `aurum' significat bonum, n. 113, 1551, 1552, et argenti, quia `argentum' significat verum, n. 1551, 2048.  Inde nunc patet quod per `terram quadringentorum 
siclorum argenti' significetur pretium redemptionis per verum; inde est quia agitur de Ecclesia spirituali, quae per verum a Domino reformatur et regeneratur, n. 2954, quod dicatur `terra'; quod per 
terram significetur Ecclesia, videatur n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f. @1 qui tunc ex vastatione illa emergunt, illi$  @2 videtur$  @3 i quam$  @4 a Jacobo$  @5 i inde$  @6
