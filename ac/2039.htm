<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2039节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2039.</strong>“你们所有的男子都要受割礼”表洁净。这从“割礼”的代表性和衍生的含义清楚可知。割礼或受割礼表示除去并抛弃那些阻碍、玷污属天之爱的元素，也就是恶欲，尤其是自我之爱的恶欲，以及由这些欲望所产生的虚假。之所以具有这种含义，是因为两性生殖器官代表属天之爱。有三种爱构成主国度的属天之物，即婚姻之爱，对婴儿的爱和对社群的爱或相爱。婚姻之爱是所有爱中最主要的爱，因为它含有服务于最大功用的目的，就是人类的繁衍、因而主国度的繁衍，它是主国度的神学院。接着是对婴儿的爱，它源于婚姻之爱，然后是对社群的爱或相爱。凡掩盖、阻碍并玷污这些爱的，都由“包皮”来表示；受割礼或割礼因此变得具有代表性。事实上，恶欲和源于它们的虚假被除去的程度，就是这个人被洁净的程度，也是属天之爱能显化的程度。自我之爱或我欲如何违背属天之爱，并且何等污秽，这在前面已予以阐述并说明（<a href="760.htm">760</a>，<a href="1307.htm">1307</a>，<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>，<a href="1321.htm">1321</a>，<a href="1594.htm">1594</a>，<a href="2045.htm">2045</a>，<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>节）。由此清楚可知，割礼的内义表示洁净。<br />割礼无非是立约或结合的记号，这一点从以下事实清楚可知：受割礼若不伴随着心的割礼，则毫无意义；从那些污秽的爱中洁净就是心之割礼所表示的。这一点从以下圣言经文明显可知。摩西五经：<br />耶和华你神必给你的心和你种的心行割礼，好叫你尽心尽性爱耶和华你的神，使你可以存活。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申30.6.htm">30:6</a>）<br />从这些话清楚可知，“给心行割礼”表从污秽的爱中洁净，以便尽心尽性爱耶和华神或主。<br />耶利米书：<br />要开垦你们的荒地，不要撒种在荆棘中！犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民哪，你们当自行割礼归耶和华，将你们心的包皮除掉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.3.htm">4:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“你们当自行割礼归耶和华，将你们心的包皮除掉”无非是指除去这类阻碍天堂之爱的事物。由此也清楚可知，对心行割礼是受割礼所表示的某种更为内在之物。摩西五经：<br />所以你们的心要受割礼，不可再硬着颈项。耶和华为孤儿寡妇伸冤，又怜爱寄居的，赐给他衣食。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.16.htm">10:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处也很明显，“你们的心要受割礼”表从伴随污秽之爱的邪恶和源于它们的虚假中洁净。爱的属天事物被描述为仁爱的行为，即“为孤儿寡妇伸冤”、“又怜爱寄居的，赐给他衣食”。<br />耶利米书：<br />看哪！日子将到，我要刑罚一切在肉身受过割礼的，就是埃及、犹大、以东、亚扪人、摩押人和一切住在旷野剃周围头发的。因为列族都没有受割礼，以色列全家心中也没有受割礼。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.25.htm">9:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这也表明割礼表示洁净的记号。尽管他们被称为“在肉身受过割礼的”，但仍被算在受割礼的民族之列，甚至包括犹太人；以色列被说成是“心中没有受割礼”。摩西五经：<br />那时，他们未受割礼的心若谦卑了。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.41.htm">26:41</a>）<br />这里的意思也一样。<br />“包皮”（foreskin）和未受割礼的表示不洁之物。这清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />锡安啊，兴起！兴起！披上你的能力。圣城耶路撒冷啊，穿上你华美的衣服！因为未受割礼的和不洁净的，必不再进入你中间。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.1.htm">52:1</a>）<br />“锡安”表属天教会；“耶路撒冷”表属灵教会，未受割礼的，就是不洁净的不再进入其中。<br />割礼是立约的记号，或结合的标志。这从以下事实明显看出来：类似事物就由果树来代表，它们也要受割礼。对此，摩西五经上说：<br />你们到了迦南地，栽种各样可作食物的树木，要给它的包皮割礼。三年之内，你们要以它的果子如未受割礼的，是不可吃的。但第四年所结的果子全要成为圣，用以赞美耶和华。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.23.htm">19:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.24.htm">24</a>）<br />“果子”和“心”一样，代表和表示仁爱，这从圣言中的很多地方可以看出来。它们的“包皮”相应地表示阻碍并玷污仁爱的不洁。<br />说来奇妙，当天上的天使通过污秽的属世之物酝酿洁净的观念时，类似割礼的某种事物在灵人界表现为极速。因为在灵人界，天使观念逐渐变成灵人界的代表物。在犹太教会，有些代表性仪式即源于这一源头，有些则不是。在灵人界，那些具有极速割礼表现的灵人是渴望被准许进入天堂的人。在他们被准许进入前，这种代表物就会出现。这解释了为何约书亚在百姓过了约旦河，即将进入迦南地时，受命给他们行割礼。百姓进入迦南地无非代表那些有信之人被准许进入天堂。<br />这就是为何约书亚受命行第二次割礼，如约书亚记所描述的：<br />耶和华对约书亚说，你制造小火石剑，第二次给以色列人行割礼。约书亚就制造了小火石剑，在除皮山那里给以色列人行割礼。耶和华对约书亚说，我今日将埃及的羞辱从你们身上滚去了。因此，他称那地方名叫吉甲（就是“滚”的意思）。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.2.htm">5:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“小火石剑”表他们要具备的真理，以使他们能矫正并驱散污秽的爱。因为没有对真理的认知，洁净是不可能的。“石头”或“磐石”表真理，这在前面已说明（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>节）。从圣言明显可知，“剑”论及真理，邪恶可被真理矫正。</p>

That every male be circumcised. That this signifies purity, is evident from the representation and derivative signification in the internal sense of "circumcising." Circumcision, or the cutting off of 
the foreskin, signified the removal and wiping away of those things that were impeding and defiling celestial love, and which are the evils of cupidities (especially the evils of the cupidities of the 
love of self) and the derivative falsities. The reason of this signification is that the organs of generation, in both sexes, represent celestial love. There are loves of three kinds that constitute 
the celestial things of the Lord's kingdom, namely, conjugial love, love for infants, and the love for society, or mutual love. Conjugial love is the principal love of all, because it has within it 
the end of greatest use, namely, the propagation of the human race, and thereby of the Lord's kingdom, of which it is the seminary. Love toward infants follows next, being derived from conjugial love; 
and then comes the love for society, or mutual love. Whatever covers up, obstructs, and defiles these loves, is signified by the foreskin; and the cutting off of this, or circumcision, was therefore 
made representative; for insofar as the evils of cupidities, and the falsities derived from them are removed, insofar the man is purified; and insofar celestial love can appear. How contrary to celestial 
love, and how filthy, is the love of self, has been stated and shown above (n. 760, 1307, 1308, 1321, 1594, 2045, 2057). From what has now been said, it is clear that in the internal sense "circumcision" 
signifies purity.  [2] That circumcision is only a sign of covenant, or of conjunction, may be plainly seen from considering that the circumcision of the foreskin amounts to nothing at all without 
the circumcision of the heart; and that it is the circumcision of the heart, or purification from the filthy loves above referred to that is signified by it, as is plainly evident from the following 
passages in the Word. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God in thy whole heart, and in thy whole soul, that thou mayest live 
(Deut. 30:6); </p>
<p>from which it is evident that to "circumcise the heart" is to be purified from filthy loves, in order that Jehovah God, or the Lord, may be loved with all the heart and with all the soul. 
 [3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns; circumcise yourselves unto Jehovah, and take away the foreskin of your heart, O man of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem 
(Jer. 4:3-4); </p>
<p>to "circumcise one's self to Jehovah, and remove the foreskin of the heart," is to remove such things as obstruct heavenly love; all which shows that the circumcision of the heart 
is an interior thing that is signified by the circumcision of the foreskin. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and shall no longer harden your neck, doing the judgment of 
the orphan and the widow, and loving the stranger to give him bread and raiment (Deut. 10:16, 18); </p>
<p>where also it is clear that to "circumcise the foreskin of the heart" is to be purified from the evils 
of filthy loves and from the falsities derived from them. The celestial things of love are described by these works of charity, namely, "doing the judgment of the orphan and the widow," and "loving 
the stranger to give him bread and raiment."  [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold, the days come in which I will visit upon everyone that is circumcised in the foreskin, upon Egypt, and upon Judah, and 
upon Edom, and upon the sons of Ammon, and upon Moab, and upon all that are cut off at the corner, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are 
uncircumcised in heart (Jer. 9:25-26); </p>
<p>where it is evident that circumcision is significative of purification, for they are called the "circumcised in the foreskin," but still are reckoned among the 
uncircumcised nations, as are even the Jews; and Israel is said to be "uncircumcised in heart." And it is the same in Moses: </p>
<p>     If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled (Lev. 26:41). [5] That 
by the "foreskin" and by "one that is uncircumcised" is signified uncleanness, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy beauty, O Jerusalem, the 
city of holiness; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean (Isa. 52:1). By "Zion" is meant the celestial church, and by "Jerusalem" the spiritual church, 
into which what is "uncircumcised," that is, the "unclean," shall not enter.  [6] That circumcision is a sign of a covenant, or a token of conjunction, is clearly evident from the fact that the like 
was represented by means of the fruits of trees, which also were to be circumcised, concerning which in Moses: </p>
<p>     When ye shall have come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees of 
food, ye shall circumcise the foreskin thereof, its fruit; three years shall they be unto you as uncircumcised, it shall not be eaten; and in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holiness 
for praises unto Jehovah (Lev. 19:23-24); </p>
<p>"fruits," like the "heart," represent and signify charity, as may be seen from many passages in the Word; and thus their "foreskin" signifies the uncleanness 
which obstructs and contaminates charity.  [7] Wonderful to say, when the angels who are in heaven have the idea of purification from natural defilements, with the utmost rapidity there is represented 
in the world of spirits something like circumcision; for the angelic ideas pass over into representatives in the world of spirits. In the Jewish Church some of the representative rites originated in 
this source, and some did not. Those with whom that quick circumcision was represented in the world of spirits, were in the desire to be admitted into heaven; and before they were admitted, there was 
this representation. This shows why Joshua was commanded to circumcise the people, when, having passed over Jordan, they were entering the land of Canaan; for the entrance of the people into the land 
of Canaan represented this very admission of the faithful into heaven.  [8] For this reason circumcision was commanded a second time, concerning which in Joshua: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make 
thee swords of rocks, and circumcise the sons of Israel the second time; and Joshua made him swords of rocks, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins; and Jehovah said unto Joshua, 
This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you; and he called the name of that place Gilgal [Rolling off] (Joshua 5:2-3, 9); </p>
<p>the "swords of rocks" signify the truths with which 
they were to be imbued, in order that thereby they might castigate and disperse filthy loves; for without the knowledges of truth no purification is possible. (That a "stone" or "rock" signifies truths, 
has been shown before, n. 643, 1298; and that a "sword" is predicated of the truths by which evils may be castigated, is evident from the Word.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2039</b></p><p><b>2039.</b>
'Every male [among you] is to be circumcised' means purity. This is clear from the representation and consequently the meaning of 'circumcising' in the internal sense. Circumcision or cutting off the 
foreskin meant nothing else than the removal and rejection of those elements which stand in the way of and defile heavenly love, namely evil desires, especially those of self-love, and falsities resulting 
from those desires. The reason why this is the meaning is that the genital organs of both sexes represent heavenly love. There are three kinds of love which constitute the heavenly things of the 
Lord's kingdom - conjugial love, the love of infants, and social or mutual love. Conjugial love is the chief love of all because it has within it the end of serving the greatest use, namely the propagating 
of the human race, and therefore of the Lord's kingdom for which it is the seminary. Next to conjugial love, and deriving from it, comes the love of infants, and after that social or mutual love. 
Whatever covers over, obstructs, and defiles those loves is meant by the foreskin, the cutting away of which, or circumcision, therefore became representative. Indeed to the extent evil desires and 
resulting falsities are removed, a person is purified and heavenly love can show itself. How contrary self-love is to heavenly love, and how filthy, has been stated and shown in <a href="760.htm">760</a>, <a href="1307.htm">1307</a>,<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>, <a href="1321.htm">1321</a>, <a href="1594.htm">1594</a>, <a href="2045.htm">2045</a>, <a href="2057.htm">2057</a>. From these considerations it is plain that circumcision in the internal sense means purity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That circumcision is no more than the sign of a covenant or of conjunction becomes 
quite clear from the fact that circumcising the foreskin counts for absolutely nothing if unaccompanied by circumcision of the heart; and that purification from those filthy loves is what circumcision 
of the heart means is quite evident from the following places in the Word: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, so that you will love Jehovah your God with 
all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2030:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 30:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is clear that 'circumcising the heart' means being purified from filthy loves in order that Jehovah God or 
the Lord may be loved with all the heart and all the soul. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and remove the foreskin 
of your heart, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Circumcising oneself to Jehovah and removing the foreskin of the heart' is nothing other than removing such things as stand 
in the way of heavenly love. From this it is also clear that circumcision of the heart is something more interior that is meant by circumcision of the foreskin. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall circumcise the 
foreskin of your heart, and you shall be stiff-necked no longer. [Jehovah] executes judgement for the orphan and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him bread and clothing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:16,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:16, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
also it is plain that 'circumcising the foreskin of the heart' means being purified from the evils that accompany filthy loves and from resulting falsities. The heavenly things of love are described 
as charitable works, namely 'executing judgement for the orphan and widow', and 'loving the sojourner to give him bread and clothing'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are coming in which I 
will visit every one circumcised in the foreskin - Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut and who dwell in the wilderness, 
for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%209:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 9:25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too shows that circumcision was a sign meaning purification. Although they are called 
'circumcised in the foreskin', these nations - the Jews included along with the rest - are considered to be 'uncircumcised nations', and Israel to be 'uncircumcised in heart'. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If at 
that time their uncircumcised heart is humbled. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:41&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:41</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 That the foreskin and being uncircumcised means that which is unclean is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Awake, awake, 
put on your strength, O Zion, put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for there will no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Zion' is used to 
mean the celestial Church and 'Jerusalem' the spiritual Church into which the uncircumcised, which means the unclean, will not enter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That circumcision is 'a sign of the covenant' or token of conjunction 
is quite clear from the fact that the same was represented by the requirement to circumcise the fruits of trees also, spoken of in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
When you come into the land and plant 
any kind of tree for food you shall circumcise its foreskin, its fruit For three years it shall be to you uncircumcised; it shall not be eaten. And in the fourth all its fruit shall be holy. to the praises 
of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2019:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 19:23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fruit' similarly represents and means charity, as becomes clear from many places in the Word. Their 'foreskin' accordingly means the uncleanness that obstructs and 
pollutes charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Here is a marvel: When angels in heaven conceive the idea of purification from natural things that are filthy, something akin to circumcision is represented very speedily in 
the world of spirits, for in the world of spirits angelic ideas come over as representatives. In the Jewish Church there were some representative religious ceremonies which had those same origins and 
there were others which did not. The spirits with whom that swift circumcision was represented in the world of spirits were people who wished to be allowed into heaven, but before they were allowed 
in this representation took place. This explains why Joshua was commanded to circumcise the people after they had crossed the Jordan and were about to enter the land of Canaan. The people's entry into 
the land of Canaan represented nothing else than the admission into heaven of those who have had faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 This is why circumcision was commanded a second time, described in Joshua as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
said to Joshua, Make swords of flint for yourself; circumcise the children of Israel a second time. And Joshua made swords of flint for himself, and circumcised the children of Israel on the 
hill of foreskins. And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. And he called the name of that place Gilgal (rolling away). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%205:2,%203,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 5:2, 3, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Swords of flint' 
means the truths which they were to be provided with to enable them to correct and cut back filthy loves, for without cognitions of truth no purification is possible. That 'stone' or 'flirt' means 
truths has been shown already, in <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, and that 'a sword' has reference to truths by which evils may be corrected is clear from the Word. </p>

`Circumcidi omnem masculum': quod significet puritatem, constat a repraesentatione et inde significatione `circumcidere' in sensu interno; circumcisio seu excisio praeputii non aliud significabat quam 
remotionem et abstersionem eorum quae impediebant et inquinabant amorem caelestem, quae sunt mala cupiditatum, imprimis cupiditatum amoris sui, et falsa inde; causa hujus significationis est quia genitalia 
utriusque sexus amorem caelestem repraesentant; sunt tria genera amorum {1} quae constituunt caelestia regni Domini, nempe amor conjugialis, amor erga infantes, et amor societatis seu mutuus; 
amor conjugialis est principalis omnium, nam in eo finis maximi usus, nempe propagatio generis humani, et inde regni Domini cujus est seminarium; amor erga infantes proxime succedit qui inde; et dein 
amor societatis seu mutuus; quicquid obtegit, impedit, et conspurcat hos amores, significatur per `praeputium,' cujus excisio seu circumcisio ideo repraesentativa facta (o)est; quantum enim mala cupiditatum 
et falsa inde removentur, tantum purificatur homo, et tantum apparere potest amor caelestis: amor sui quam contrarius sit amori caelesti et quam spurcus, dictum et ostensum est n. 760, 1307, 1308, 
1321, 1594, (o)2045, 2057; ex his liquet quod circumcisio in sensu interno significet puritatem.  [2] Quod circumcisio sit modo signum foederis seu conjunctionis, constare potest manifeste ex eo 
quod circumcisio praeputii nihil prorsus sit absque circumcisione cordis; et quod circumcisio cordis quae est purificatio a spurcis illis amoribus, sit quae significatur; ut manifeste ab his in Verbo 
locis patet; apud Mosen, 	Circumcidet Jehovah Deus cor tuum, et cor seminis tui, ad amandum Jehovam Deum tuum in toto corde tuo, et in tota anima tua, propterea ut vivas, Deut. xxx 6; </p>
<p>ex quibus constat 
quod `circumcidere cor' sit purificari a spurcis amoribus, ut amari possit {2} Jehovah Deus seu Dominus, ex toto corde et ex tota anima: [3] apud Jeremiam, 	Novate vobis novale, et ne seratis inter 
spinas, circumcidite vos Jehovae, et removete praeputia cordis vestri, vir Jehudae et habitatores Hierosolymae, iv 3, 4; </p>
<p>`circumcidere se Jehovae, et removere praeputia cordis' nec aliud est quam 
removere talia quae impediunt amorem caelestem; inde etiam constat quod circumcisio cordis sit interius quod significatur per circumcisionem praeputii: apud Mosen, 	Circumcidetis praeputium cordis vestri, 
et cervicem vestram ne induretis amplius,... faciens judicium orphani et viduae, et amans peregrinum ad dandum (c)illi panem et vestem, Deut. x 16, 18; </p>
<p>ubi etiam quod `circumcidere praeputium cordis' 
sit purificari a malis amorum spurcorum et a falsis inde, liquet; caelestia amoris describuntur per opera charitatis, nempe per `facere judicium orphani et viduae' et per `amare peregrinum ad dandum 
(c)illi panem et vestem': [4] apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce dies venientes, quibus visitabo super omnem circumcisum in praeputio, super Aegyptum, et super Jehudam, et super Edomum, et super filios Ammonis, 
et super Moabum, et super omnes abscissos anguli, habitantes in deserto, quia omnes gentes praeputiatae, et omnis domus Israelis praeputiati corde, ix 24, 25; </p>
<p>quod circumcisio significativum purificationis 
sit, inde quoque patet; vocantur `circumcisi praeputio,' sed usque `gentes praeputiatae,' inter ceteras etiam Jehudas; et Israel praeputiati corde: apud Mosen, 	Vel tunc humiliabitur cor eorum 
praeputiatum, Lev. xxvi 41; </p>
<p>similiter.  [5] Quod per praeputium et praeputiatum significetur immundum, constat apud Esaiam, 	Excitare, excitare, indue robur tuum Zion, indue vestes decoris tui 
Hierosolyma, civitas sanctitas, quia non addet, veniet in te amplius praeputiatus et immundus, (x)lii 1; </p>
<p>per `Zionem' intelligitur Ecclesia caelestis, per `Hierosolymam' Ecclesia spiritualis, in quam 
praeputiatum quod est immundum, non intrabit.  [6] Quod circumcisio sit `signum foederis' seu indicium conjunctionis, manifeste constat ex eo quod simile repraesentatum per arborum fructus qui etiam 
circumciderentur, de quibus ita apud Mosen, 	Quando veneritis in terram, et plantaveritis quamcumque arborem cibi, praeputiabitis praeputium ejus, fructum ejus; tribus annis erit vobis praeputiati, non 
comedetur, et in anno quarto erit omnis fructus ejus sanctitas laudum Jehovae, Lev. xix 23, 24; </p>
<p>`fructus' similiter repraesentant et significant charitatem, ut a multis locis in Verbo constare potest, 
ita `praeputium' eorum significat {3} immundum quod charitatem impedit et contaminat.  [7] Quod mirabile, cum angeli qui in caelo, ideam purificationis a spurcis naturalibus habent {4}, tunc in mundo 
spirituum repraesentatur velocissime quoddam simile circumcisionis, nam ideae angelicae in repraesentativa in mundo spirituum evadunt.  Fuerunt ritus repraesentativi in Ecclesia Judaica qui inde 
originem duxerunt, et fuerunt quoque qui non inde: illi apud quos in mundo spirituum repraesentabatur velox illa circumcisio, volebant admitti in caelum, et antequam admissi, hoc {5} repraesentatum erat; 
ex quo constare potest cur mandatum Joshuae quod circumcideret populum cum Jordanem transgressi intrarent in terram Canaanem; introitus populi in {6} terram Canaanem non aliud repraesentabat quam 
intromissionem fidelium in caelum, [8] ideo circumcisio secundo mandata erat, de qua ita apud Joshuam, 	Jehovah dixit ad Joshuam, Fac tibi gladios petrarum, circumcide filios Israelis secundo; et fecit 
sibi Joshua gladios petrarum, et circumcidit filios Israelis ad collem praeputiorum:... et dixit Jehovah ad Joshuam, Hodie devolvi opprobrium Aegypti desuper vobis, et vocavit nomen loci illius Gilgal 
(devolutio), v 2, 3, 9; </p>
<p>`gladii petrarum' significant vera quibus imbuerentur, ut sic spurcos amores castigare et discutere possent, nam absque cognitionibus veri nusquam aliqua purificatio; quod 
`lapis seu petra' significet vera, prius n. 643, 1298, ostensum est, et quod `gladius' praedicetur de veris quibus castigentur mala, ex Verbo constat. 	@1 amoris.$ 	@2 queat.$ 	@3 denotat.$ 	@4 habent
