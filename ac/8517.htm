<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8517节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8517.</strong>“各人要在自己的地方休息”表一种平安的状态。这从“休息”的含义清楚可知，“休息”是指一种平安的状态（参看<a href="8494.htm">8494</a>节）。他们要在安息日休息，这时不做任何工，甚至不为自己预备所要吃的，这种要求是一种平安状态的代表，良善与真理的结合在平安的状态下由主实现；因为良善与真理的一切结合都是在这种状态下实现的。当一个人处于一种平安的状态时，他也被主通过良善引导；那时此人若要引导自己，即便是通过真理引导自己，就会驱散平安的状态，结果就不会有结合</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8517</b></p><p><b>8517.</b>
Rest ye everyone in his place. That this signifies a state of peace, is evident from the signification of "resting," as being a state of peace (see n. 8494). That they were to rest on the Sabbath day 
and do no work then, not even kindle a fire, nor prepare for themselves what they were to eat, was representative of a state of peace, in which the conjunction of good and truth is effected by the Lord; 
for all the conjunction of good and truth is effected in this state. When a man is in a state of peace, he is then also led of the Lord by means of good; if a man were then to lead himself, even by 
means of truth, he would dissipate the state of peace, and so there would be no conjunction (see just above, n. 8516). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8517</b></p><p><b>8517.</b>
'Rest, each of you in his place' means a state of peace. This is clear from the meaning of 'resting' as a state of peace, dealt with above in <a href="8494.htm">8494</a>. The requirement for them to rest on the sabbath day, 
when they were not to do any work, not even kindle a fire or prepare for themselves what they were going to eat, was representative of the state of peace in which the joining together of goodness and 
truth is accomplished by the Lord; for all joining together of goodness and truth is accomplished in that state. When a person is in a state of peace he is also led by the Lord through good. If at that 
time the person were to be his own guide, even though he were guided by truth, he would dispel the state of peace, and as a consequence there would be no joining together, see immediately above in <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>. </p>

</p><b>8517.</b>
`Quiescite quisque sub se': quod significet statum pacis, constat ex significatione `quiescere' quod sit status pacis, de qua supra n. 8494; quod quiescerent die sabbati, et tunc nullum opus facerent, 
{1} ne quidem ignem accenderent, et praepararent sibi quod ederent, erat repraesentativum status pacis in quo conjunctio boni et veri fit a Domino, nam omnis conjunctio boni et veri fit in illo statu; 
{1} cum homo in statu pacis est, tunc etiam ducitur a Domino per bonum; si tunc homo {2}se duceret, etiamsi per verum, dissiparet statum pacis, inde nulla conjunctio; videatur mox supra n. 8516. 	@1
