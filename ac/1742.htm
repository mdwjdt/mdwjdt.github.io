<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1742节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1742.</strong>“你把灵魂给我，财物你自己拿去吧”表祂要赋予他们生命，他们不再关心别的事。这从“灵魂”和“财物”的含义清楚可知：前面（<a href="1000.htm">1000</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>，<a href="1040.htm">1040</a>节）说明，“灵魂”是指生命；稍后将说明，“财物”是指所有不那么适合生命的其它事物。<br />恶灵所拥有并拼命热爱的生命是属于源自对自我和尘世之爱的欲望的生命，因而是伴随仇恨、报复、残忍的生命；他们以为其它生命中不可能有快乐可言。恶灵就象这样的人（因为他们曾经是人，并且在身为人时就通过其生活持守这种信念），他们的一切生命都专注于伴有这类欲望的快乐中；事实上，他们只知道这种生命是唯一的生命，不知道别的，一旦丧失它，他们必要彻底死亡。他们所热爱的这种生命的性质从来世他们的同类清楚看出来。在来世，它会转化为最令人作呕的生命。然而，说来奇怪，他们觉得这种恶臭是最令人快乐的，这从记事（<a href="820.htm">820</a>，<a href="954.htm">954</a>节）明显可知。<br />魔鬼也一样，当主将他们从那个疯子身上逐出来时，他们因害怕丧命而乞求附到猪身上去（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可5.7.htm">5:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可5.13.htm">13</a>）。这些魔鬼就是那些在肉身生活时屈服于污秽的贪婪之人。这一点从以下事实可以看出来：在来世，这种人觉得自己在猪群当中消磨时光，因为猪的生活就对应于贪婪，因此令他们感到快乐，这从前面的记事（<a href="939.htm">939</a>节）明显可知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1742.</strong> Give me the souls, and the property take for yourself, means to give [evil spirits] their lives and they would ignore the rest. This can be seen from the symbolism of a soul as life, as discussed earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1000" target=_top>1000</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005" target=_top>1005</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1040" target=_top>1040</a>; and from the symbolism of property as the rest, which is not strictly speaking alive (or not as much so), discussed just below.<br />[2] The life that evil spirits have and desperately love is a life consisting in the urges of self-love and materialism. So it is a life of hatred, revenge, and cruelty. No other kind of life offers any joy, they believe. They resemble humans, since they once were human; and from their former life as humans they retain this belief that all life consists in the joy of such wicked urges. They remain wholly convinced that such a life is the only life, and that if they lose it they will be obliterated. The nature of the life these people love can be seen from their existence in the other world, where it turns into something that resembles reeking excrement. Amazingly, they perceive the stench to be an extremely pleasant fragrance, as shown by the personal experiences related in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_820" target=_top>820</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_954" target=_top>954</a>.<br />[3] They act like the demons that the Lord was casting out of a madman, who in terror for their lives begged him to send them into some pigs (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/bible_king-james-version_mark_5_7-13" target=_top>Mark 5:7-13</a>). These demons had been sordid misers during bodily life, as can be seen from the fact that in the other life they seem to themselves to spend their lives among pigs. The life of a pig corresponds to greed, which makes such a life pleasing to them, as indicated by the experience related in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1742/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_939" target=_top>939</a>. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1742</b></p><p><b>1742.</b>
Give me the soul, and take the substance to thyself. That this signifies that He should give them life, and they would not care for other things, is evident from the signification of "soul," as being 
life (treated of before, n. 1000, 1005, 1040); and from the signification of the "substance," as being the other things that are not so properly of life, of which more will be said presently.  [2] The 
life which evil spirits have, and which they love extremely, is the life of the cupidities of the love of self and of the world, hence a life of hatreds, revenge, and cruelties; and they suppose that 
there can be no delight in any other life. They are like men-for they have been men, and they retain this belief from their life when they were men-who place all life in the delights of such cupidities, 
not knowing but that such life is the only life, and that when they lose it they will utterly die. But of what nature is that life which they love, is plain from those of this character in the other 
life, where it is turned into a fetid and excrementitious life, and wonderful to say, they perceive the stench as most enjoyable; as may be seen from what is related from experience in n. 820, 954. 
 [3] It was the same with the demons, who, when the Lord cast them out of the maniac, fearing for their life, asked that they might be sent into the swine (Mark 5:7-13). That these demons were those 
who in the life of the body had been given up to filthy avarice, may be seen from the fact that such seem to themselves in the other life to pass their time among swine, for the reason that the life 
of swine corresponds to avarice, and is therefore delightful to them; as is evident from what is related from experience in n. 939. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1742</b></p><p><b>1742.</b>
'Give me the people and take the acquisitions for yourself'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means that He was to give them life and they would not care about anything else. This is clear from the meaning of 'soul' as life, dealt with 
already in <a href="1000.htm">1000</a>,<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>,<a href="1040.htm">1040</a>, and from the meaning of 'acquisitions' as all the other things that do not belong properly to life, dealt with immediately below. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The life that evil spirits have 
and love desperately is the life belonging to the desires that derive from self-love and love of the world - consequently the life that goes with hatred, revenge, and cruelty; and they imagine that no 
delight can exist in any other kind of life. They are like men, for they have been men and retain this conviction from their life when they were men. They centre all life in the delight that accompanies 
such desires; indeed they know no other than that this life is the only life, and that when they lose it they will die completely. The nature of the life they love is clear from those like them in 
the next life. There it is converted into a life that stinks most disgustingly, yet what is remarkable, they perceive that stench as something most delightful, as becomes clear from what has been told 
from experience in <a href="820.htm">820</a>, <a href="954.htm">954</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same applies to the devils who, having been cast out of the demoniac by the Lord, begged for fear of their lives to be sent into the pigs, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%205:7-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 5:7-13</a>. That these 
were people who during their lifetime had surrendered themselves to foul avarice becomes clear from the fact that such people seem to themselves in the next life to spend their time among pigs. They 
do so because the life of pigs corresponds to avarice, and therefore they find it delightful, as is clear in what has been told from experience in <a href="939.htm">939</a>.

'Da mihi animam, et acquisitionem accipe tibi': quod significet ut daret illis vitam, et cetera non curarent, constat ex significatione 'animae' quod sit vita, de qua prius n. 1000, 1005, 1040, et ex 
significatione 'acquisitionis' quod sint cetera, quae non ita proprie sunt vitae, de quibus in mox sequentibus.  [2] Vita quam spiritus mali habent et perdite amant, est vita cupiditatum amoris sui 
et mundi; inde vita odiorum, vindictarum et crudelitatum; in nulla alia vita jucundum dari putant; sunt sicut homines, nam homines fuerunt et a vita cum fuerunt homines, hoc retinent; qui in jucundo talium 
cupiditatum omnem vitam ponunt, non scientes aliter quam quod a vita sit unica, et cum illam amittunt, quod prorsus morituri; sed qualis vita sit quam amant, constat a talibus in altera vita; vertitur 
a in fetidam et excrementitiam, et mirum, fetorem istum ut jucundissimum percipiunt, ut constare potest ab illis quae ab experientia n. 820, 954; similiter ac [3] Daemones, qui cum a Domino ejicerentur 
ex maniaco, ex timore vitae rogabant ut mitterentur in porcos, Marc. v 7-13; </p>
<p>quod fuerint in qui in vita corporis foedae avaritiae dediti fuerunt, constare potest exinde quod tales videantur 
sibi in altera vita inter porcos degere, ex eo quod porcorum vita avaritiae correspondeat, et ideo illis jucunda, ut constat ex illis quae ab experientia n. 939. </p>
