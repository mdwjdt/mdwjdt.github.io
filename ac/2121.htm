<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2121节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2121．最后的审判即将发生，这在地上和教会中不像所有灵魂都到达并聚集的来世那样明显。如今，灵人界充满恶魔和恶灵，绝大部分来自基督教界。他们当中盛行的，无非是仇恨、报复、残忍、淫秽和阴谋诡计。这不仅是新来的灵魂首先到达的灵人界的情形，也是那些就其动机和意图而言具有内在邪恶之人所在世界的内在气场的情形。时至今日，这个内在气场已超负荷，以致我纳闷怎会如此之多。所有人并非瞬间被投入地狱，因为按照秩序法则，所有这样的人都要回到他在肉身时所拥有的生活中，并以这种方式被逐步带入地狱。主从不将任何人投入地狱，而是每个人将自己投入地狱。结果。这些灵人的世界挤满了众多这类灵人，他们会在那里聚集并停留一段时间。由于他们，从尘世来的灵魂受到可怕的压制。而且，与人同在的灵人（因为主经由灵人和天使管理每个人）比之前更易被挑动起来，以恶毒的暗示苦待人，并且到了与他同在的天使几乎无法驱散他们，而被迫从很远的地方流入那人的地步。在来世，由此明显看出末世即将来临。</p>

That a Last Judgment is at hand,* cannot be so evident on the earth and within the church as in the other life, whither all souls arrive, and flock together. At this day the world of spirits is full 
of evil genii and evil spirits, mostly from the Christian world, among whom there reign nothing but hatreds, revenges, cruelties, obscenities, and deceitful machinations. Nor is this the case only with 
the world of spirits, where souls fresh from the world first arrive, but also with the interior sphere of that world, where those are who have been interiorly evil in respect to their intentions and 
ends. This likewise is at the present day so crowded that I have wondered there ever could be so great an abundance. For all are not instantly cast down into the hells, because it is according to the 
laws of order that every such person should return into his life which he had had in the body, and should in this way be brought down by degrees into hell. The Lord casts no one into hell, but everyone 
casts himself there. The result is that these Worlds of spirits are thronged with a crowd of such spirits, who gather and stay there for a time. By their means the souls who come from the world are 
frightfully infested. Moreover the spirits who are with man (for every man is governed by the Lord through spirits and angels) are more stirred up than heretofore to bring malign influences to bear upon 
man, and this to such a degree that the angels who are with him can scarcely avert them, but are compelled to inflow into man from a greater distance. In the other life it is from all this very evident 
that the last time is at hand. * This was first published in 1750. </p>

The Last Judgement is now imminent, but this is not so clear on earth and within the Church as it is in the next life, to which place all souls go and flock together. At the present time the world of 
spirits is full of evil genii and evil spirits drawn for the most part from the Christian world. Among them nothing but forms of hatred, revenge, cruelty, disgusting behaviour, and also scheming devices 
prevail. This is the situation not only in the world of spirits where souls recently arrived from the world first gather, but also in the interior sphere of that world where those people are who, 
as regards their intentions and ends in view, have been interiorly evil. This interior sphere is at the present time so full to capacity that I have wondered that so vast a number could ever exist. For 
all are not cast down into the hells instantly, since the laws of order ensure that every such person shall return to the life that was his during his lifetime, and from that point be taken down step 
by step into hell. The Lord casts no one down into hell, but everyone does so to himself. Consequently those worlds of spirits are completely full to overflowing- with the vast number of such souls 
gathering and remaining there for a time. Because of them souls coming from the world are horribly oppressed. And in addition the spirits who are present with a person - for everyone is governed by the 
Lord by means of spirits and angels - are stirred more than ever before to afflict him with wicked suggestions, doing so to such an extent that the angels present with him can scarcely ward them off, 
but are compelled to flow into that person from further away. From this situation as it exists in the next life it is quite clear that the final period is imminent. </p>

Quod ultimum judicium instet, non ita constare potest in terris et intra Ecclesiam ac in altera vita, quo omnes animae veniunt et confluunt; mundus spirituum hodie plenus est malis geniis et malis spiritibus, 
maxime ex orbe Christiano; et inter eos non regnant nisi odia, vindictae, crudelitates, obscenitates, tum machinationes dolosae: nec solum mundus spirituum quo animae recentes e mundo primum 
alluunt, sed etiam sphaera istius mundi interior, ubi sunt qui quoad intentiones et fines interius mali fuerant; haec similiter hodie adeo oppleta est ut miratus quod tanta copia usquam dari potuisset; 
omnes enim in inferna non momento dejiciuntur, quia secundum leges ordinis est ut quisque talis redeat in vitam suam quam habuit in corpore, et inde per gradus deferatur in infernum; Dominus nullum 
dejicit in infernum, sed quisque semet; inde mundi illi spirituum oppletissimi sunt copia alluentium talium et morantium ibi ad tempus; ex illis animae quae e mundo veniunt, atrociter infestantur; et 
praeterea, spiritus qui apud hominem, (nam quisque homo per spiritus et angelos regitur a Domino:) {1} plus quam prius excitantur ad inferenda homini maligna, et quidem in tantum ut angeli qui apud 
{2} hominem, vix possint avertere, sed cogantur remotius in hominem influere.  Exinde in altera vita manifeste constare potest quod ultimum tempus instet. 	@1 No parentheses in A.$ 	@2 i etiam.$ </p>
