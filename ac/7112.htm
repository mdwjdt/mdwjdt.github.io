<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7112节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7112.</strong>“你们不可把稻草给百姓”表最低级或最基本的记忆知识，就是最笼统的。这从“稻草”的含义清楚可知，“稻草”（即粮草，straw或chaff）是指记忆知识的真理（参看<a href="3114.htm">3114</a>节），事实上是指最低级或最基本和最笼统的那种记忆知识；“稻草”因是牲畜的食物，故在灵义上表示最低级或最基本的那类事物。这些记忆知识当充满感官幻觉时，就被称为最低级或最基本的；恶人正是滥用最低级或最基本的记忆知识来败坏良善和真理，从而支持邪恶和虚假；因为这些知识由于所包含的幻觉能被扭曲，以支持虚假的原则和邪恶的欲望。此外，这类记忆知识也是最笼统的；除非充满不怎么笼统和更具体的真理，否则它们就会为虚假和邪恶所用。不过，它们越充满真理，就越不为它们所用。这类知识是那些在世时宣称唯信，然而过着邪恶生活的人在来世侵扰正直人所用的手段。但由于天使驱散了这些知识，故经上在此说他们不再给百姓作砖的草，也就是不再提供用来生产要被引入的捏造物和虚假的那类知识。这就是这些话的内义，内义的确看似与字义相去甚远；但要知道，自然界的事物无不对应于灵界的某种事物。与人同在的天使以属灵的方式来理解此人以属世的方式所理解的一切事。他们不知道草是什么，也不知道砖是什么。这些天使在世时知道这类东西，但当进入天堂时就忘了，因为他们在那里转向了属灵事物。这解释了为何当天使感知到人对自然界的这类事物的观念时，他们就将其转化为相对应的属灵事物。“稻草”或“青草”表示最低级或最基本的记忆知识，“砖”表示捏造物和虚假，这一点从许多考虑可以看出来；因为一切草本植物和稻草无非是指这类知识，没有其它含义。不过，种子，大麦、小麦等等是指内层真理和良善；非人凿的石头是指真理。</p>

Ye shall no more give the people straw. That this signifies the lowest memory-knowledges and the most general of all, is evident from the signification of "chaff" or "straw," as being truths of memory-knowledge 
(see n. 3114), and indeed memory-knowledges the lowest and most general of all, for the lowest food in a spiritual sense is straw or chaff, because it is the food of beasts. Those knowledges 
are called lowest which are full of fallacies of the senses, which the evil abuse to pervert goods and truths, and thus to defend evils and falsities; for on account of fallacies these knowledges can 
be turned in favor of principles of falsity and of cupidities of evil. Moreover such knowledges are the most general of all, and unless they are filled with truths less general and more particular, 
they may be of service to falsities and evils, but in proportion as they are filled with truths, they are of less service to them. Such are the knowledges whereby they who in the world have professed 
faith alone, and yet have lived a life of evil, infest the upright in the other life; but as these knowledges are dispelled by the angels, it is now said that they should not give straw to make brick, 
that is, that they did not add these to the fictitious and false things that would be injected. Such is the internal sense of these words, which indeed appears remote from the sense of the letter; but 
be it known that there is nothing in the natural world which does not correspond to something in the spiritual world; and the angels with a man understand all things spiritually which the man understands 
naturally; they do not know what straw is, nor bricks; such things were known to them when they were in the world, but were forgotten when they came into heaven, because there they put on spiritual 
things. Hence it is that when the angels perceive the ideas of such things with a man, they turn them into corresponding spiritual things. That "straw" or "grass" denotes the lowest memory-knowledge, 
and that "bricks" denote things fictitious and false, can be seen from many considerations; for all herbage and straw have no other signification; but seeds, barley, wheat, and the like denote interior 
truths and goods; and stones not artificial denote truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7112</b></p><p><b>7112.</b>
'You Shall longer give the people straw' means factual knowledge, the basest and most general kind of all. This is clear from the meaning of 'straw' as factual truths, dealt with in <a href="3114.htm">3114</a>, in particular 
the basest and most general kind of factual knowledge, for since 'straw' is the food of beasts 'straw' means the basest kind of food in the spiritual sense. Factual knowledge is said to be the basest 
when it is full of the illusions of the senses. It is what the evil misuse to pervert forms of good and truth and so lend support to evils and falsities; for on account of the illusions it contains 
that knowledge can be twisted round in favour of false suppositions and evil desires. That kind of factual knowledge is also the most general of all, and unless it is filled out with less general and 
more specific truths it can be of use to evils and falsities. But the more it is filled out with truths, the less it can have that kind of use. Such knowledge is the means by which the upright in the 
next life are molested by those who, when they were in the world, proclaimed belief in faith alone and yet led a life of evil. But because it is banished by the angels the narrative says at this point 
that they should no longer give the people straw to make bricks, that is, no longer provide such knowledge for producing fabrications and falsities which are to be introduced. This is the internal sense 
of these words, which does indeed seem remote from the sense of the letter; but it should be recognized that there is nothing in the natural world that does not correspond to some reality in the 
spiritual world. The angels present with a person understand in a spiritual way everything understood by the person in a natural way. They do not know what straw is, or what bricks are either. Such things 
were well known to those angels when they were in the world, but they forgot about them when they entered heaven, because there they moved on to spiritual things. This explains why when a person's 
ideas of such things in the natural world are perceived by angels they convert them into the corresponding spiritual realities. The fact that 'straw' or 'grass' means the basest kind of factual knowledge, 
and 'bricks' fabrications and falsities, may be seen from a number of considerations; for herbaceous plants, and also those that produce straw, are nothing else than such knowledge. But seeds, 
barley-grains, wheat-grains, and the like are interior truths and forms of good; and stones that are not man-made are truths. </p>

`Non addetis dare paleam populo':  quod significet scientifica infima et omnium communissima, constat ex significatione `paleae' seu `straminis' quod sint vera scientifica, de qua n. 3114, et (d)quidem 
scientifica infima {1}et omnium communissima, nam cibus in spirituali sensu infimus est stramen seu palea, quia est bestiarum.  Scientifica infima dicuntur quae fallaciis sensuum plena sunt, quibus 
mali {2}abutuntur ad pervertendum bona {3}et vera, ac ita ad patrocinandum {4}malis et falsis, nam illa scientifica propter fallacias verti possunt in favorem (d)principiorum falsi et cupiditatum mali; 
talia etiam sunt omnium communissima, quae nisi veris minus communibus et particularibus implentur, {5} inservire falsis et malis possunt, sed sicut implentur veris, ita minus inserviunt.  Talia sunt 
per quae illi qui solam fidem in mundo confessi sunt, et tamen vitam mali vixerunt, in altera vita probos infestant; at quia illa ab angelis {6} discutiuntur, dicitur nunc quod non adderent dare paleam 
ad laterificandum lateres, hoc est, quod non adderent illa ad ficticia et {7} falsa quae injicientur.  Hic sensus internus horum verborum est, qui quidem remotus apparet a sensu litterae; sed sciendum 
quod nihil sit in mundo naturali quod non correspondet rei alicui in mundo spirituali; et angeli apud hominem omnia spiritualiter intelligunt quae homo naturaliter; illi non sciunt quid palea nec 
quid lateres; talia illis nota fuerunt cum erant in mundo, sed oblivioni data cum venerunt in caelum quia induerunt ibi spiritualia; inde est cum angeli appercipiunt ideas talium apud hominem, vertant 
illa in correspondentia spiritualia.  Quod `palea' seu `gramen' sit scientificum infimum, et `lateres' sint ficticia et {7} falsa, ex pluribus constare potest; herbacea enim non aliud sunt, ut et 
straminea; semina autem, hordea, {8} tritica, et similia, sunt vera et bona interiora; et lapides non facti sunt vera. 	@1 seu$ 	@2 utuntur$ 	@3 in mala et vera in falsa$ 	@4 suis amoribus malis,
