<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8480节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8480.</strong>“有人把它留到早晨”表对神之良善的滥用，因为他们想要从自己那里获得它。这从“把它留到早晨”的含义清楚可知，“把它留到早晨”是指对获得他们自己的良善的忧虑，如前所述（<a href="8478.htm">8478</a>节），因而是指对神之良善的滥用。当表面相似的事物出现，然而却从相反的来源产生时，就被称为“滥用”。当良善源于人，而非源于主时，它就是从一个相反的来源产生的。因为主是良善本身，因而是一切良善的源头。来源于祂的良善拥有神性在里面；因此，它是来自其至内或最初存在的良善。而来源于人的良善不是良善，因为人本身无非是邪恶。因此，源于人的良善在其最初本质上就是邪恶，尽管它表面上看似良善。此中情形就像拿画板上所画的花与长在花园里的花相比较。后一种花从其至内层就是美丽的，因为它们越往内层打开，就越美丽；而画板上所画的花仅表面上是美丽的，内在无非是泥浆和杂乱无章地混在一起的尘土颗粒。这也是主说下面这些话时所教导的：<br />就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的还不如这花一朵呢！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.29.htm">6:29</a>）<br />这就是来源于人的良善和来源于主的良善的情况。人无法知道这些良善彼此如此不同，因为他通过外在表象进行判断。而天使清楚知道人的良善源于何处，因而是何性质。与人同在的天使处于源于主的良善，可以说就住在其中。他们不可能处于源于人的良善；而是尽可能地远离它，因为它从至内在就是邪恶。源于主的良善有天堂在里面，因为这良善在形像上就是天堂的形式，并将主自己隐藏在它的至内层。因为从主发出的一切良善里面都有祂自己的一个样式，因而有天堂的一个样式。而来自人的一切良善里面都此人的一个样式；由于人本身无非是邪恶，所以它是一个地狱的样式。源于主的良善和源于人的良善之间就存在如此大的不同。<br />源于主的良善就存在于那些爱主高于一切，爱邻如己的人中间；但源于人的良善则存在于那些爱自己高于一切，与自己相比鄙视邻舍的人中间。后者也是那些为明天忧虑的人，因为他们信靠自己；而前者是那些不为明天忧虑的人，因为他们信靠主（参看<a href="8478.htm">8478</a>节）。那些信靠主的人不断从主领受良善；事实上，凡发生在他们身上的事，无论表面看上去是否有利，都是良善，因为它作为一个手段而有助于他们永恒的幸福。但那些信靠自己的人则不断给自己招来邪恶，因为凡发生在他们身上的事，即便表面看上去似乎是有利和幸运的，却都是邪恶，因而成了导致他们永恒不幸的手段。这些就是这一命令所表示的事：他们不可将吗哪留到早晨，留下的都生虫变臭了。</p>

And men made a residue of it until the morning. That this signifies the abuse of good Divine, in that they desired to acquire it from themselves, is evident from the signification of "making a residue 
of it until the morning," as being to be solicitous about the acquisition of good of themselves (of which above, n. 8478), and consequently the abuse of good Divine. It is termed "abuse," when there 
arises what is alike in ultimates, but from a contrary origin. Good arises from a contrary origin, when it does so from man, and not from the Lord; for the Lord is good itself, consequently He is the 
source of all good. The good which is from Him has in it what is Divine; thus it is good from its inmost and first being; whereas the good which is from man is not good, because from himself man is nothing 
but evil; consequently the good which is from him is in its first essence evil, although in the outward form it may appear like good. The case herein is like that of flowers painted upon a tablet, 
as compared with the flowers that grow in a garden. These flowers are beautiful from their inmosts; for the more interiorly they are opened, the more beautiful they are; whereas the flowers painted 
on a tablet are beautiful only in the outward form, and as to the inward one are nothing but mud and a mixture of earthy particles lying in confusion, as the Lord also teaches when He says of the lilies 
of the field that "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these" (Matt. 6:29). [2] Such is the case with the good that is from man in comparison with the good that is from the Lord. 
A man cannot know that these goods are so different from each other, because he judges from outward things; but the angels well perceive whence comes the good with a man, and consequently what is the 
nature of it. The angels who are with a man are in good from the Lord, and as it were dwell therein; but they cannot be in the good that is from a man; they remove themselves from it as far as they 
can, because inmostly it is evil. Good from the Lord has heaven in it, for this good is the form of heaven in an image, and in its inmost it stores up the Lord Himself, because in all the good that proceeds 
from the Lord there is a semblance of Himself, and consequently a semblance of heaven; whereas in the good that is from a man there is a semblance of the man, and as from himself a man is nothing 
but evil, there is a semblance of hell in it. So great is the difference between good from the Lord, and good from man.  [3] Good from the Lord is with those who love the Lord above all things and 
the neighbor as themselves; but good from man is with those who love themselves above all things and despise the neighbor in comparison with themselves. These are they who have care for the morrow, because 
they trust in themselves; but the former are they who have no care for the morrow, because they trust in the Lord (see above, n. 8478). They who trust in the Lord continually receive good from 
Him; for whatsoever happens to them, whether it appears to be prosperous or not prosperous, is still good, because it conduces as a means to their eternal happiness. But they who trust in themselves are 
continually drawing evil upon themselves; for whatever happens to them, even if it appears to be prosperous and happy, is nevertheless evil, and consequently conduces as a means to their eternal unhappiness. 
These are the things which are signified by the command that they should make no residue of the manna till the morning, and that what was left bred worms and stank. </p>

'And some did leave part of it until the morning' means the abuse of God's goodness, in that they wished to obtain it of themselves. This is clear from the meaning of 'leaving it until the morning' as 
being anxious to acquire good of themselves, dealt with above in <a href="8478.htm">8478</a>, which is therefore the abuse of God's goodness. It is called an abuse when something of a like nature to outward appearances arises, 
yet springs from a contrary origin. Good arises from a contrary origin when it springs from man, not from the Lord. For the Lord is absolute Good and therefore the source of all good. Good that 
originates in Him has the Divine within it, and so is good right through to its inmost or prime being. But good that originates in man is not good, because in himself man is nothing but evil. Consequently 
good originating in him is primarily and in essence evil, though to outward appearance it may look like good These things are like flowers portrayed in a picture compared to flowers that grow in 
the garden. The latter flowers are beautiful through to their inmost parts, for the more they open out the more beautiful they become. But flowers portrayed in a picture are beautiful merely in outward 
appearance; for inwardly they are nothing other than clay and a mass of particles of earth lying in disorder within it. This is also what the Lord teaches when He says, </p>
<blockquote>
Solomon in all his glory was 
not clothed like one of the lilies of the field. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:29</a>. 
</blockquote>

 So it is with good that originates in man and good that originates in the Lord. Man cannot know that those kinds of good are so greatly 
different from each other because he judges by external appearances. But angels have a clear perception of where man's good originates and what it is therefore like. The angels with a person are 
present and so to speak dwelling in good originating in the Lord. They are unable to be present in good originating in man; they get as far away from it as they can, since inmostly it is evil. For good 
originating in the Lord has heaven within it; that good images the form of heaven, concealing in itself inmostly the Lord Himself. For in all good that comes from the Lord there is a likeness of Him 
and therefore a likeness of heaven. But in all good that comes from man there is a likeness of man; and since man in himself is nothing but evil it is a likeness of hell. This is how greatly different 
good originating in the Lord is from good originating in man. </p>
<p>Good originating in the Lord exists with those who love the Lord above all things and their neighbour as themselves; but good originating 
in man exists with those who love themselves above all things and despise their neighbour in comparison with themselves. The latter are also those who are concerned for the morrow because they 
trust in themselves, whereas the former are those who are unconcerned for the morrow because they trust in the Lord, a matter dealt with above in <a href="8478.htm">8478</a>. Those who trust in the Lord are constantly receiving 
good from Him; for whatever happens to them, whether it seems to be advantageous or not advantageous, is nevertheless good, for it serves as a means contributing to their eternal happiness. But those 
who trust in themselves are constantly bringing evil on themselves, for whatever happens to them, even if it seems to be advantageous and fortunate, is nevertheless bad, and consequently acts as 
a means contributing to their eternal unhappiness. These are the things that are meant when it says that they were to leave none of the manna till the morning, and that any they did leave bred worms and 
putrified. </p>

`Et residuum fecerunt viri ex illo usque ad mane': quod significet abusum boni Divini, quod ex se sibi id comparare vellent, constat ex significatione `residuum facere usque ad mane' quod sit sollicitum 
esse de boni acquisitione ex se, de qua supra n. 8478, consequenter est abusus boni Divini; abusus dicitur cum simile in ultimis existit, sed ex contraria origine; {1} ex contraria origine existit 
bonum, cum ab homine, non a Domino; Dominus enim est ipsum Bonum, proinde est a quo omne bonum; bonum quod ab Ipso {2} in se habet Divinum, {3}ita ab intimo ac a primo esse est bonum, at bonum quod 
ab homine {2} non est bonum, quia homo ex se non est nisi quam malum; inde bonum quod ab illo est in prima sua essentia malum, tametsi in externa forma apparere potest ut bonum; se habent illa sicut flores 
qui sunt picti super tabella {4}comparate ad flores qui nascuntur in horto; hi flores ab intimis pulchri sunt, nam quo {5}interius aperiuntur, eo pulchriores sunt, at flores in tabella picti sunt 
modo in externa forma pulchri, {6}et quoad internam non sunt nisi quam lutum et congeries partium terrestrium incondite jacentium; quod etiam Dominus docet cum dicit, Non Salomo in omni gloria sua 
indutus fuit sicut unum ex liliis agri, Matth. vi 29; </p>
<p>2 ita se habet cum bono quod ab homine, et cum bono quod a Domino {7}; quod illa bona tantum inter se differant, homo non scire potest, {8}quia ab 
externis judicat; angeli autem probe percipiunt unde bonum apud (d)hominem, et inde quale est; angeli apud hominem in bono a Domino sunt et quasi habitant, {10}et in bono ab homine non {11}possunt esse, 
removent se ab illo quantum possunt, nam ab intimo est malum; bonum enim {12} a Domino in se habet caelum, est enim bonum illud in imagine forma caeli, ac recondit in {13}intimo suo Ipsum Dominum, 
nam in omni bono quod procedit a Domino est instar Ipsius, {14}ac inde instar caeli, at in bono quod ab homine est instar hominis, et quia homo ex se nihil nisi quam malum est, est instar inferni; tanta 
differentia est boni a Domino, et boni {15}ab homine. 	3 Bonum a Domino est apud illos qui amant Dominum supra omnia, et proximum sicut se, at bonum ab homine est apud illos qui semet supra omnia 
amant, et proximum prae se contemnunt; hi sunt qui etiam curam pro crastino habent, quia fidunt sibi, illi autem sunt qui curam pro crastino non habent, quia fidunt Domino, de qua re supra n. 8478; 
qui fidunt Domino, (x)illi continue {16}accipiunt ab Ipso bonum, nam quicquid illis contingit, sive ut prosperum sive ut non prosperum appareat, usque est bonum, nam ut medium conducit ad felicitatem 
eorum aeternam; at qui fidunt sibi, illi continue sibi inducunt malum, nam quicquid illis contingit, etiamsi ut prosperum et felix appareat, usque tamen est malum, et inde ut medium conducit ad infelicitatem 
eorum aeternam; haec sunt quae significantur per quod ex manna nihil residuum facerent ad mane, et quod residuum vermicularet vermes et putresceret. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 i venit$ 	@3 et$ 	@4 comparative$ 	@5
