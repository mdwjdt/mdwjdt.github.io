<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8129节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8129.</strong>“转回”表他们还没有做好准备。这从“转回”的含义清楚可知，“转回”，即从非利士人之地的路转到旷野之路，再转到红海，是指他们还没有做好准备，即没有为他们进入迦南地所表示的引入天堂做好准备。至于此中情形，以及“转回”表示他们没有做好准备，这从对前一章18节的解释和说明（<a href="8098.htm">8098</a>，<a href="8099.htm">8099</a>节）可以看出来，即：在他们经历试探，主通过这些试探坚立真理和良善，并将它们联结起来之前，他们无法被引入天堂。这就是此处“做好准备”的意思。</p>

That they turn back. That this signifies that they were not yet prepared, is evident from the signification of "turning back," namely, from the way of the land of the Philistines to the way of the wilderness 
at the sea Suph, as being that they were not yet prepared, namely for introduction into heaven, which is signified by their entrance into the land of Canaan. How the case herein is, and that 
"turning back" denotes that they were not prepared, can be seen from what was unfolded and shown at verse 18 of the preceding chapter (n. 8098, 8099); namely, that they could not be introduced into heaven 
until they had undergone temptations, and the Lord had thereby confirmed truths and goods and had conjoined them. This is here meant by "being prepared." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8129</b></p><p><b>8129.</b>
'And let them turn back' means that they have not yet been prepared. This is clear from the meaning of 'turning back' - that is to say, from the way of the land of the Philistines to the way of the wilderness, 
to the Sea Suph - as their not yet having been prepared, prepared for introduction into heaven, meant by their entrance into the land of Canaan. The implications of this, and the meaning of 
'turning back' as their being unprepared, become clear from what has been explained and demonstrated at verse 18 of the previous chapter, in <a href="8098.htm">8098</a>, <a href="8099.htm">8099</a> - that they could not be led into heaven until 
they had undergone temptations, and through these the Lord had firmly established truths and forms of good and had bonded them together. This is what being prepared means here. </p>

`Et revertantur': quod significet quod nondum praeparati, constat ex significatione `reverti,' nempe a via terrae Philistaeorum ad viam deserti ad mare Suph, quod sit quod nondum praeparati, nempe ad 
{1}introductionem in caelum, {2}quae significatur per ingressum illorum in terram Canaanem.  Quomodo haec se habent, et quod `reverti' sit quod non praeparati, constare potest ab illis quae ad vers. 
18 capitis praecedentis n. 8098, 8099, explicata et ostensa sunt, quod nempe non in caelum possent introduci priusquam subiverant tentationes, et Dominus per illas confirmaverat vera et bona, et conjunxerat 
illa; hoc per praeparari hic {3}intelligitur. 	@1 intrandum$ 	@2 quod significabatur$ 	@3 significatur$ </p>
