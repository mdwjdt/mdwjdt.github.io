<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5406节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5406.</strong>“你们可以下到那里，从那里给我们买”表通过那记忆知识将它们变成它自己的。这从“下到”和“买”的含义清楚可知：“下到”是指着去往更外在的事物说的，如下文所述；“买”是指变成人自己的，如前所述（<a href="4397.htm">4397</a>，<a href="5374.htm">5374</a>节）。“从那里”，即从埃及表示这一切通过记忆知识实现，“埃及”表示记忆知识，如前所示。在圣言中，当经上说从一个地方到另一个地方时，我们经常读到“上到”和“下到”；不是因为一个地方比另一个地方更高，而是因为“上到”论及去往更内在或更高级的事物，而“下到”论及去往更外在或更低级的事物。也就是说，“上到”论及去往属灵和属天的事物，因为这些更内在，也被视为更高级；而“下到”论及去往属世和世俗的事物，因为这些更外在，表面上也更低级。这解释了为何在圣言中，我们不仅在此处，还在其它各处都读到从迦南地“下到”埃及，从埃及“上到”迦南地。因为“迦南地”表示属天之物，而“埃及”表示属世之物。事实上，迦南地在代表意义上是指天国，因而是指属天和属灵的良善和真理；这些良善与真理更内在地居于为主国度的人里面；而“埃及”在代表意义上是指属世国度，因而是指属于外在教会，并且大部分作为记忆知识存在的良善与真理。“上到”论及去往更内在的事物（参看<a href="4539.htm">4539</a>节）。</p>

Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence. That this signifies appropriation by means of them, is evident from the signification of "going down," as being said of going toward exterior things 
(of which in what follows); and from the signification of "buying," as being appropriation (n. 4397, 5374); that this is effected by means of memory-knowledges is signified by "from thence," that is, 
from Egypt (that "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges has been shown above). In the Word we often read of "going up" and "going down," when going from one place to another is spoken of-not because one place 
was more elevated than the other, but because "going up" is predicated of going toward what is interior or higher, and "going down" of going toward what is exterior or lower; that is to say "going 
up" is predicated of going toward spiritual and celestial things, for these are interior, and are also believed to be higher, and "going down" is predicated of going toward natural and earthly things, 
for these are exterior and are also in appearance lower. For this reason it is that not only here but also everywhere else in the Word, we read of "going down" from the land of Canaan to Egypt, and 
of "going up" from Egypt to the land of Canaan; for by the "land of Canaan" is signified what is heavenly, and by "Egypt" what is natural. For the land of Canaan in the representative sense is the heavenly 
kingdom, and consequently celestial and spiritual goods and truths, which also are interiorly in the man who is a kingdom of the Lord; while Egypt in the representative sense is the natural kingdom, 
and consequently the goods and truths which are of the external church, and are for the most part memory-knowledges. (That "going up" is predicated of going toward interior things may be seen above, 
n. 4539.) </p>

'Go down there, and buy for us from there' means making them its own through that knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'going down' as an expression used to describe movement towards things that 
are more external, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'buying' as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="4397.htm">4397</a>, <a href="5374.htm">5374</a>. The accomplishment of this through that knowledge, factual knowledge, is meant 
by 'from there', that is to say, from Egypt; for 'Egypt' means factual knowledge, as shown above. Various places in the Word contain the expression to go up or to go down when a movement from one place 
to another is described. The reason for this usage is not that one place was higher than another but that going up describes a movement towards things that are more internal or superior, while going 
down describes a movement towards things that are more external or inferior. That is, 'going up' refers to movement towards things that are spiritual and heavenly since these are more internal and are 
believed to be superior, whereas 'going down' refers to a movement towards natural and earthly things as these are more external and also to outward appearance inferior. This explains why not only here 
but also everywhere else in the Word one is said to go down from the land of Canaan to Egypt and to come up from Egypt to the land of Canaan. 'The land of Canaan' means that which is heavenly, and 
'Egypt' that which is natural; for in the representative sense the land of Canaan is the heavenly kingdom, and consequently celestial and spiritual forms of good and truth, which also reside more internally 
in a person who is the Lord's kingdom, whereas 'Egypt' in the representative sense is the natural kingdom, and consequently the forms of good and truth which belong to the external Church and 
exist for the most part as factual knowledge. For the use of 'going up' to describe a movement towards things that are more internal, see <a href="4539.htm">4539</a>. </p>

`Descendite illuc, et emite nobis inde': quod significet appropriationem per illa, constat ex significatione `descendere' quod praedicetur versus exteriora, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `emere' 
quod sit appropriatio, de qua n. 4397, 5374; quod sit per illa, nempe per scientifica, significatur per `inde', nempe ex Aegypto; quod `Aegyptus' sint scientifica, supra ostensum est. In Verbo passim 
dicitur ascendere et descendere, cum ab uno loco in alterum, non ex causa quod unus locus editior fuerit altero, sed quia `ascendere' praedicatur versus interiora seu superiora, et `descendere' versus 
exteriora seu inferiora, hoc est, quod `ascendere' praedicetur versus spiritualia et caelestia, haec enim interiora sunt, et quoque creduntur superiora, et `descendere' versus naturalia et terrestria, 
haec enim exteriora sunt, et quoque ad apparentiam inferiora; inde est quod non {1}solum hic sed etiam ubivis alibi in Verbo, dicatur a terra Canaan ad Aegyptum descendere, et ab Aegypto ad terram 
Canaan ascendere; per `terram Canaan' enim significatur caeleste, et per `Aegyptum' naturale, nam terra Canaan in sensu repraesentativo est regnum caeleste, consequenter bona et vera caelestia et 
spiritualia, quae quoque sunt interius apud hominem qui est regnum Domini, at `Aegyptus' in sensu repraesentativo est regnum naturale, consequenter bona et vera {2}quae sunt Ecclesiae externae, et quoad 
plurem partem sunt scientifica; quod ascendere praedicetur versus interiora, videatur n. 4539. @1 modo$  @2 naturalia quae una voce dicuntur$ </p>
