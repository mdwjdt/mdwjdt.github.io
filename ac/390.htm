<p><strong>[NCE]390.</strong> Moses shows how those who succumb to falsity and evil fall prey to an unremitting fear of murder:<br />And your land will be a ruin and your cities a wasteland. Those of you who are left — I will make their heart soft in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will pursue them, and they will flee as if fleeing a sword, and fall when no one pursues them. And they will each collide with their brother as if before a sword, though no one pursues them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_390/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_33" target=_top>Leviticus 26:33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_390/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_36-37" target=_top>36-37</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />Traitors betray and traitorously commit the treachery of traitors.{*1} And it will happen that one fleeing from a terrifying sound will fall into the pit, and one climbing out of the middle of the pit will be caught in the snare. Their transgression will weigh on them; therefore they will fall and not rise again. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_390/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_16-20" target=_top>Isaiah 24:16-20</a>)<br />In Jeremiah:<br />Here, I am bringing a horror on you; from all your surroundings you will each be driven out before it, and there will be no one to gather the wanderers. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_390/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:5</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />"On a horse we will flee," and so you will flee. "And on a swift mount we will ride," so your pursuers will grow swift. One thousand will flee at the reproach of one, and at the reproach of five you will flee. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_390/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_16-17" target=_top>Isaiah 30:16-17</a>)<br />This place and others in the Word depict those who are subject to falsity and evil — how they flee, and how they fear they will be killed. Everything causes them fear because no one is protecting them.<br />All who have evil and falsity inside hate their neighbor; therefore each of them is eager to kill the others.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The phrase "traitors betray and traitorously commit the treachery of traitors" here echoes the repetition in the Latin, perfidi perfide agunt, et perfidia perfidorum perfide faciunt, which in turn reflects the repetition in the original Hebrew: בֹּגְדִים‭ ‬בָּגָדוּ‭ ‬וּבֶגֶד‭ ‬בּוֹגְדִים‭ ‬בָּגָדוּ (bōḡǝḏîm bāḡāḏû ûḇeḡeḏ bôḡǝḏîm bāḡāḏû).

Those who are in evil and falsity are in continual dread of being slain, as is thus described in Moses: </p>
<p>     Your land shall be a desolation, and your cities a waste, and upon them that are left of 
you I will bring softness into their heart in the land of their enemies, and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall when none pursueth, 
and shall stumble everyone upon his brother, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth (Lev. 26:33, 36-37). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The treacherous deal treacherously, yea, in the treachery of the 
treacherous they deal treacherously. And it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit, and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken 
in the snare; the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again (Isa. 24:16-20). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold, I bring a dread upon thee, from all thy circuits shall 
ye be driven out every man toward his faces, and none shall gather up him that wandereth (Jer. 49:5). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     We will flee upon the horse, therefore shall ye flee; and, we will ride upon 
the swift, therefore shall they that pursue you be rendered swift; one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one, at the rebuke of five shall ye flee (Isa. 30:16-17). In these and other passages of the 
Word, those who are in falsity and evil are described as "fleeing" and as in "fear of being slain." They are afraid of everybody, because they have no one to protect them. All who are in evil and falsity 
hate their neighbor, so that they all desire to kill one another. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 390</b></p><p><b>390.</b>
People under the influence of falsity and evil live in constant fear of being killed, as is described in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
And your land will be a desolation and your cities a waste. Among you who are left, 
I will introduce a softness into their heart, in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a driven leaf will pursue them, and they will flee, like flight from the sword, and they will fall though 
no one is pursuing, and they will stumble each man over his brother, as though before the sword, though no one is pursuing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:33,%2036,%2037&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:33, 36, 37</a>.   
</blockquote>
In Isaiah,    The treacherous act treacherously, 
and deal treacherously in the treachery of the treacherous. And he who is fleeing from the sound of the terror will fall into the pit. And he who is climbing out of the middle of the pit will be caught 
in the snare. His transgression will lie heavily upon him, and therefore he will fall and not rise again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:16-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:16-20</a>.  </p>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am bringing a terror upon you. From all who are 
round about you you will be driven out, everyone straight before him,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and no one gathering the wanderer. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:5</a>.   
</blockquote>
In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
We will flee upon a horse; and so will you flee. We will ride 
away on one that is swift; therefore those who pursue you will be made swift. One thousand at the rebuke of one, and at the rebuke of five will you flee. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:16, 17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These and other places in 
the Word describe how people who are under the influence of falsity and evil flee and are afraid of being killed. Fear above all else takes hold of them because no one is protecting them. Everyone who 
is under the influence of evil and falsity hates the neighbour. Consequently they all desire to kill one another.

Quod ii qui in falso et malo, in continuo terrore sint, ut occidantur, describitur apud Mosen, 	Et erit terra vestra desolatio, et urbes vestrae vastitas,... residuos inter vos, inducam mollitiem in 
cor eorum, in terris hostium eorum, et persequetur eos vox folii impulsi, et fugient fugam gladii, cadentque nullo persequente, et impingent quisque in fratrem suam, quasi coram gladio, et persequens 
nullus, Lev. xxvi 33, 36, 37: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Perfidi perfide agunt, et perfidia perfidorum perfide faciunt, et erit fugiens a voce pavoris cadet in foveam; et ascendens e medio foveae, capietur laqueo; 
... gravis erit super eo praevaricatio ejus, ideo cadet, et non addet surgere, xxiv 16-20: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce adducens super te pavorem;... ab omnibus circuitibus tuis expulsi eritis, quisque 
ad facies ejus, nec congregans 	vagantem, xlix 5: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Super equo fugiemus, ideoque fugietis; et super veloce equitabimus, ideo veloces reddentur persequentes vos; mille unam a coram increpatione 
unius, et a coram increpatione quinque fugietis, XXX 16, 17. Hic et alibi in Verbo descripti sunt qui in falso et malo, quod fugiant, et timeant ne occidantur; timor iis inest prae omni quia 
nemo tutatur: quisque qui in malo et falso est, odio habet proximam, inde eorum unusquisque alterum occidere cupit.
