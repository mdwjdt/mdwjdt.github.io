<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5377节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于与大人的对应关系（续）</h4><br />此处关于内脏与大人的对应关系<br />【节】5377.前一章末尾论述的主题是人体的一些内脏与大人的对应关系，也就是说，肝、胰、胃等内脏与大人的对应关系。现在继续论述腹膜、肾脏、输尿管、膀胱，以及肠与大人的对应关系。凡在人里面的东西，无论是在外在人里面的，还是在内在人里面的，都与大人拥有一种对应关系。没有与大人，即天堂，或也可说灵界的这种对应关系，就没有任何东西能够存在并持续存在，因为它与先于它自己之物没有联系，因而与那首先的，即主没有联系。凡缺乏这种联系，因而独立之物片刻不能存在。因为凡持续存在的，完全凭它与使它存在之物的联系，以及对使它存在之物的依赖而持续存在，因为持续存在就是不断存在。<br />由此可知，不仅人里面的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，对应于大人，而且宇宙中的每一个事物也对应于大人。太阳本身有一种对应关系，月亮也是；因为在天堂，主既是太阳，也是月亮。太阳的火与热，以及光，都有一种对应关系，因为它的热与火就对应于主对全人类的爱，它的光则对应于祂的神性真理。星星也有一种对应关系，它们对应于天堂的社群及其居民。倒不是说天上的社群住在星星里，而是说它们按照星星排列的次序而被排列。凡在太阳底下的，都有一种对应关系，如太阳底下动物界中的每一个事物，以及太阳底下植物界中的每一个事物。除非灵界流入它们全部，以及每一个，否则它们立刻分崩离析。<br />我已通过大量经历得知这一点，因为我曾被指示，动物界的许多事物，以及植物界的更多事物对应于灵界的哪种事物；还被指示这一事实：若没有灵界的流注，它们根本无法持续存在。因为一旦在先之物被拿走，在后之物必灭亡；一旦在先之物与在后之物分离，情况也一样。由于对应关系主要是人与天堂，并通过天堂与主的对应关系，所以在来世，每个人的对应关系的性质决定了他在天堂之光中所显现的模样。这解释了为何天使拥有难以形容的光明和美丽的外表，而地狱里的人则有难以言表的黢黑和丑陋的外表。</p>

Continuation concerning the correspondence with the Grand Man; here concerning the correspondence of the interior viscera therewith. The subject treated of at the close of the preceding chapter was 
the correspondence of some of the interior viscera of the body with the Grand Man, namely, of the liver, the pancreas, the stomach, and some others. The subject is now continued with the correspondence 
therewith of the peritoneum, the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and also of the intestines; for whatever is in man, both what is in the external man and what is in the internal, has a correspondence 
with the Grand Man. Without correspondence therewith (that is, with heaven, or what is the same, with the spiritual world) nothing would ever come into existence and subsist, for the reason that 
it would have no connection with what is prior to itself, nor consequently with the First, that is, with the Lord. What is unconnected, and thus independent, cannot subsist for a single moment; for its 
subsistence is from its connection with that from which is all existence, and its dependence upon it, because subsistence is a perpetual coming into existence. [2] Hence it is that not only all things 
in general and particular in man correspond, but also all and each in the universe. The sun itself corresponds, and also the moon; for in heaven the Lord is the Sun, and also the Moon. The sun's flame 
and heat, and also its light, correspond; for it is the Lord's love toward the whole human race to which the flame and heat correspond, and the Divine truth to which the light corresponds. The very 
stars correspond, the societies of heaven and their habitations being what they have correspondence with; not that they are in the stars, but that they are in a similar order. Whatever appears under 
the sun corresponds, as all and each of the subjects in the animal kingdom, and also all and each of the subjects in the vegetable kingdom; and unless there were an influx from the spiritual world into 
all and each, they would instantly sink down and shrivel away. This has been granted me to know by much experience; for I have been shown with what things in the spiritual world many things in the 
animal kingdom, and many more in the vegetable kingdom, correspond, and also that without influx they would by no means subsist; for when that which is prior is taken away, that which is posterior necessarily 
falls, and the same is the case when what is prior is separated from what is posterior. As there is an especial correspondence of man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, a man appears 
in the other life in the light of heaven according to the quality of his correspondence. Hence the angels appear in ineffable brightness and beauty, but the infernals in inexpressible blackness and 
deformity. </p>

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN - continued IN THIS SECTION TOO THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE INTERNAL ORGANS WITH IT </p>
<p>The subject at the end of the previous chapter was the correspondence of certain 
internal organs of the body with the Grand Man, that is to say, the correspondence of the liver, pancreas, stomach, and certain other organs with it. In this present section the same subject moves on 
to the correspondence of the peritoneum, kidneys, ureters, bladder, and also the intestines with it. Whatever exists in the human being, both in the external man and in the internal man, has a correspondence 
with the Grand Man. Without that correspondence with the Grand Man - that is, with heaven, or what amounts to the same, with the spiritual world - nothing can ever come into being and remain 
in being. This is because it does not have a connection with anything prior to itself or consequently with Him who is the First, that is, with the Lord. Nothing that lacks such a connection, thus that 
is independent, can remain in being for even a single instant. For everything that remains in being does so entirely by virtue of its connection with and dependence on what brings it into being; for 
remaining in being consists in a constant coming into being. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it follows that not only all the individual parts of the human being correspond to the Grand Man but also every single thing 
in the universe. The sun has a correspondence, and so does the moon; for in heaven the Lord is the Sun, and the Moon too. The fire and heat of the sun, as well as its light, have a correspondence, 
for it is the Lord's love towards the whole human race that its fire and heat correspond to, and His Divine truth that its light corresponds to. The stars too have a correspondence, the communities of 
heaven and their dwelling-places being what the stars correspond to. Not that the heavenly communities dwell in the stars, but that they have been set in order in the same kind of way as the stars. 
Everything under the sun has a correspondence - every single thing beneath it in the animal kingdom and every single thing beneath it in the vegetable kingdom. And unless the spiritual world were flowing 
into them all, every one, they would instantly break down and fall to pieces. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Considerable experience too has made me aware of all this, for I have been shown what very many things in the animal 
kingdom, and still more in the vegetable kingdom, correspond to in the spiritual world, as well as the fact that without the inflow of the spiritual world into them they cannot by any means at all 
remain in being. For once what is prior has been taken away what is posterior of necessity perishes, and likewise once what is prior has been severed from what is posterior. Since correspondence is 
primarily the correspondence of the human being with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, the specific nature of each person's correspondence therefore determines what he looks like in the next 
life in the light of heaven. This explains why angels have an indescribably bright and beautiful appearance, whereas those in hell have an unspeakably dark and ugly one. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia cum Maximo Homine, hic etiam de Correspondentia Viscerum interiorum cum illo {1} </p>
<p>@1 A d Renum, Ureterum, Vesicae et Intestinorum, i Viscerum$ </p>
<p>Actum est ad finem 
praecedentis capitis de correspondentia viscerum quorundam interiorum corporis cum Maximo Homine, nempe hepatis, pancreatis, ventriculi, et quorundam aliorum; hic autem continuabitur de correspondentia 
peritonaei, renum, ureterum, vesicae, tum intestinorum cum illo.  Quicquid enim in homine est, tam quod in externo {1} homine quam quod in interno, correspondentiam habet cum Maximo Homine; absque 
correspondentia cum illo, hoc est, cum caelo, aut quod idem, cum spirituali mundo, nihil usquam existit ac subsistit, ex causa quia non aliquem nexum habet cum priore se, consequenter nec cum Primo, hoc 
est, cum Domino; quod inconnexum est et sic independens, ne quidem uno momento subsistere potest; quod enim subsistat, est a nexu et dependentia ab illo a quo omne existentiae, nam subsistentia est 
perpetua existentia {2}.  [2] Inde est quod non solum omnia et singula apud hominem correspondeant, sed etiam omnia et singula in universo; ipse sol correspondet, et quoque luna, nam in caelo est Dominus 
Sol et quoque Luna; solis flamma et calor, ut et lux, correspondent {3}, est enim amor Domini erga universum geniis humanum cui flamma et calor, et Divinum {4} verum cui lux, correspondet; ipsa sidera 
correspondent, sunt societates caeli et habitacula eorum, cum quibus siderum est correspondentia, non quod ibi sint, sed quod in tali ordine; quicquid apparet sub sole, correspondet, sicut omnia 
et singula subjecta in regno {5} animali, et quoque omnia et singula subjecta in regno {5} vegetabili, in quae omnia et singula nisi influxus foret ex spirituali mundo, {6} momento occumberent et collaberentur; 
[3] quod etiam ab experientia multa mihi scire datum est, nam ostensum cum quibus in spirituali mundo corresponderent plura quae in regno animali, et adhuc plura quae in regno vegetabili, 
et quoque quod absque influxu nullatenus subsistant, (m)nam dempto priore necessario cadit posterius, similiter separato priore a posteriore. Quia correspondentia est cumprimis hominis cum caelo, et per 
caelum cum Domino, inde est quod qualiter correspondet homo, taliter appareat in altera vita in luce caeli, inde angeli in candore et pulchritudine ineffabili, infernales autem in nigrore et deformitate 
inexpressibili. </p>
