<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第923节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>923.</strong>“献在祭坛上为燔祭”表源于这些善与真的一切敬拜。这一点从目前所述明显可知。燔祭和后来的祭物一样，是代表性教会敬拜的主要特征。蒙主慈悲，这些事物容后再述。燔祭作为一个整体表代表性敬拜，这一点也可从先知书清楚看出来，如诗篇：<br />耶和华必从圣所对你施救助，从锡安给你支持。祂必记念你的一切祭物，悦纳你如肥脂的燔祭。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗20.2.htm">20:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗20.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />凡守安息日不亵渎它的人，我必领他们到我的圣山。他们的燔祭和祭物，在我坛上必蒙悦纳。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.6.htm">56:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“燔祭和祭物”表一切敬拜，“燔祭”表源于爱的敬拜，“祭物”表源于爱之信的敬拜。这在先知书中很常见，此处是在用外在事物描述内在事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]923.</strong> The symbolism of and he offered burnt offerings on the altar as all the worship growing out of these things is evident from what has been said so far. Burnt offerings were the main element in the worship of the representative church, as were sacrifices later on, which will be discussed below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_923/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2165#subsection-2-3" target=_top>2165:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_923/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2177" target=_top>2177:1-4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_923/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2180" target=_top>2180</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_923/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3880#subsection-2-8" target=_top>3880:8-9</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy.<br />The fact that burnt offerings symbolize all representative worship as a whole can also be seen in the prophets, as in David:<br />Jehovah will send your help from his sanctuary, and from Zion he will sustain you. He will remember all your gifts and make your burnt offering fat. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_923/bible_king-james-version_psalms_20_2-3" target=_top>Psalms 20:2-3</a>)<br />And in Isaiah:<br />All who keep the Sabbath and avoid profaning it — I will bring them to my holy mountain. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will bring great pleasure on my altar. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_923/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_56_6-7" target=_top>Isaiah 56:6-7</a>)<br />The burnt offerings and sacrifices stand for all worship. Burnt offerings stand for worship from love, sacrifices for worship from the faith that comes of love.<br />Internal attributes are described here by external actions, as they so often are in the prophets. </p>

And he offered burnt-offerings on the altar. That this signifies all worship therefrom, is evident from what has been already said. Burnt-offerings were the principal things of the worship of the representative 
church, and so thereafter were sacrifices, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. That "burnt-offerings" taken in the complex signify representative worship, is evident also 
in the Prophets, as in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; He will remember all thy offerings, and accept as fat thy burnt-offering (Ps. 20:2, 
3). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Whoso keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, them will I bring in to My holy mountain; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar (Isa. 56:6, 
7),  where "burnt-offerings and sacrifices" denote all worship; "burnt-offerings" worship from love, "sacrifices" worship from the derivative faith. As is usual in the Prophets," internal things are 
here described by external. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 923</b></p><p><b>923.</b>
'And he offered burnt offerings on the altar' means all worship stemming from those goods and truths. This is evident from what has been stated up to now. Burnt offerings were the chief features of the 
worship of the representative Church, as at a later time were sacrifices. These will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. That burnt offerings taken as a whole mean representative worship 
is also clear from the Prophets, as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will send your help from the Sanctuary, and give you support from Zion. He will remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt offering 
as fat. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2020:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 20:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever keeps the sabbath from profaning it, I will bring them to My holy mountain. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on My altar. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2056:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 56:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'burnt offerings and sacrifices' stands for all worship, 'burnt offerings' for worship stemming from love, 'sacrifices' for worship stemming from faith derived from love. As is 
common in the Prophets, internal things are here being described by those that are external. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 923</b>
</p><b>923.</b>
'Et obtulit holocausta super altari': quod significet omnem cultum inde, ex illis quae hactenus dicta sunt, patet: holocausta erant principalia cultus Ecclesiae repraesentativae, ita dein sacrificia, 
de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus.  Quod holocausta in uno complexu significent cultum repraesentativum, constat quoque apud Prophetas; ut apud Davidem, 	Jehovah mittet auxilium 
tuum e sanctuario, et ex Zione fulciet te; recordabitur omnium munerum tuorum, et holocaustum tuum pingue faciet, Ps. xx 3,4; </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, 	Quisquis custodit sabbatum a profanando illud,... introducam 
ducam eos ad montem sanctitatis Meae,... holocausta eorum et sacrificia eorum ad beneplacitum super altari Meo, lvi 6, 7; ubi 'holocausta et sacrificia' pro omni cultu; 'holocausta' pro cultu 
ex amore, 'sacrificia' pro cultu ex fide inde: interna hic describantur, ut communiter apud Prophetas, per externa. </p>
