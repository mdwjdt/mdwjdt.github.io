<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第446节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>446.</strong>我与灵谈论当今流行在世人中的普遍观点，即他们不相信灵的存在，因为未曾亲眼看到它，也无法凭借其记忆的知识（学问）理解它，所以他们不但否认灵有维度，还否认它是一个实体，甚至争论何为实体。由于他们否认灵有维度，还针对实体进行争论，所以他们也否认灵在某个地方，随之否认灵就在人体里面，然而，哪怕最简单的人或许都知道，其灵魂或灵就在他的身体内。当我谈到这些事时，那些灵——其中有的头脑更简单，都诧异于当今世人的愚蠢。当听到所争论的诸如“没有部分的部分”的话以及其它这类措辞时，他们觉得非常荒诞、可笑、滑稽，这些事根本不应该在心智当中，因为它们阻塞了通往聪明智慧的道路。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]446.</strong> I spoke with some spirits about the attitude of people alive on earth today who reject belief in the spirit because they cannot see it with their eyes or grasp it scientifically. They deny not only that a spirit has dimension but also that it has substance, because they argue about what substance even is. And since they deny its dimensionality and argue about its substantiality, they also deny that it exists in a place or, consequently, in a human body. The most simple-thinking people, however, can understand that their soul or spirit has its own body.<br />When I said these things to the spirits, who happened to be among the more simple-thinking, they expressed their amazement that people today could be so stupid. When they heard the terminology that was being argued over (parts outside of parts,{*1} and so on), they called it jarring, absurd, and pretentious. They said that such things should never take up mental space because they block the path to true understanding.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "parts outside of parts" is partes extra partes, loosely translatable as "parts external to other parts" or "parts distinct from other parts." The French philosopher Descartes (see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_446/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196" target=_top>196</a>) believed that the necessary properties of corporeal as opposed to spiritual objects were 1. being extended in space, 2. having parts that were distinct from other parts (partes extra partes), 3. being divisible, and 4. existing in a particular place. Cartesians (as the disputants in question seem to be; see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_446/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_444" target=_top>444</a>) would claim that the soul does not adhere to the principle of partes extra partes, and thus it cannot have dimension or exist in a place. The failure to conform to this principle would also mean that the soul could not have such parts as the human head, torso, limbs, etc. In other words, by this thinking the soul must lack all the components of the human form. By contrast, the more naive spirits mentioned at the end of the section, who are not blinded by philosophical cant, can readily understand that the soul possesses a spiritual human form made out of a spiritual substance. For a discussion of the issue of extension in early Enlightenment philosophy, with a note on the history of the term partes extra partes, see Pasnau 2007. [SS] </p>

I have discoursed with spirits concerning the common opinion that prevails among men at the present day, that the existence of the spirit is not to be credited because they do not see it with their eyes, 
nor comprehend it by their memory-knowledges [scientias], and so they not only deny that the spirit has extension, but also that it is a substance, disputing as to what substance is. And as they 
deny that it has extension, and also dispute about substance, they also deny that the spirit is in any place, and consequently that it is in the human body; and yet the most simple might know that his 
soul or spirit is within his body. When I said these things, the spirits, who were some of the more simple ones, marveled that the men of the present day are so foolish. And when they heard the words 
that are disputed about, such as "parts without parts" and other such terms, they called them absurd, ridiculous, and farcical, which should not occupy the mind at all, because they close the way to 
intelligence. </p>

I have spoken to spirits about the opinion held by people living at the present time, namely that they do not believe in the existence of the spirit because they neither see it with their eyes nor comprehend 
it through natural science. Consequently they not only deny that the spirit is dimensional, but also that it is a substance, for they disagree over what substance is. And because they deny that 
the spirit is dimensional and disagree about what substance is, they also deny that the spirit exists within anything spatial, and so deny its existence within the human body. Yet even a very simple 
person is able to know that his soul or spirit resides within his body. When I commented on this, spirits of a more simple type were amazed that men nowadays could be so stupid; and when they heard 
about the technical terms which men argue about such as parts outside parts, and the like, they called such things absurd, ludicrous, and farcical, which ought never to be in people's minds at all since 
they block the road to real understanding.

</p><b>446.</b>
Locutus cum spiritibus de opinione hominum qui hodie vivunt, quod non credant spiritum quia oculis non vident nec per scientias capiunt, et sic quod non solum negent spiritum esse extensum sed etiam 
esse substantiam quia litigant quid substantia; et quia negant esse extensum, et litigant substantia, etiam negant spiritum esse in loco, ita consequenter in corpore humano; cum tamen simplicissimus 
scire possit quod ejus anima seu spiritus sit in suo corpore; quae cum dicerem, mirati sunt spiritus qui inter simpliciores erant, quod homines hodie tam stulti sunt; et cum audiebant voces, de quibus 
lis, ut partes extra partes, et similia, vocabant talia absona, ludicra et theatralia quae nusquam mentes occuparent quia praecludunt viam ad intelligendum. </p>
