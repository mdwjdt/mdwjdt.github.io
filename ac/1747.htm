<p><strong>[NCE]1747.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1747/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_23" target=_top>Genesis 14:23</a>. From the string of a shoe even to its strap, if I should take anything that is yours, ... ! To prevent you from saying, "I have made Abram rich."<br />From the string of a shoe even to its strap symbolizes everything that was unclean on the earthly and bodily levels. If I should take anything that is yours means that there was nothing of the kind in his heavenly love. To prevent you from saying, "I have made Abram rich," means that the Lord never received strength from anything unclean. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1747</b></p><p><b>1747.</b>
Verse 23. That from a thread even to the thong of a shoe, I will not take aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have enriched Abram. "That from a thread even to the thong of a shoe," signifies 
all natural and corporeal things that were unclean; "I will not take aught that is thine," signifies that in celestial love here was nothing of the kind; "lest thou shouldest say, I have enriched 
Abram," signifies that the Lord derived no strength whatever from such things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1747</b></p><p><b>1747.</b>
Verse 23 That not a thread, nor even the latchet of a shoe, nor anything that is yours will I take, lest you say, I have made Abram rich. 'That not a thread, nor even the latchet of a shoe' means all 
things, natural and bodily, that were unclean. 'Nor anything that is yours will I take' means that nothing of that nature exists with celestial love. 'Lest you say, I have made Abram rich' means that 
the Lord acquired no strength whatever from such a source. </p>

</p><b>1747.</b>
Vers. 23.  Si a filo et usque ad corrigiam calcei, et si accepero ab ullo quod tibi, ne dicas, Ego ditavi Abramum. 'Si a filo et usque ad corrigiam calcei' significat omnia quae immunda naturalia et 
corporea essent: 'si accepero ab ullo quod tibi' significat quod nihil tale apud amorem caelestem: 'ne dicas, Ego ditavi Abramum' significat quod inde nihil usquam roboris Domino. </p>
