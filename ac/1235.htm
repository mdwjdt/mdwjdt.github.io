<p><strong>[NCE]1235.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1235/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_24" target=_top>Genesis 10:24</a>. And Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber.<br />Arpachshad was a nation by that name, and it symbolizes secular learning. Shelah was likewise a nation by that name, and it symbolizes the effect that results from that learning. Eber too means a nation, one whose ancestor was Eber, an individual called by that name. He symbolizes the second ancient church, which separated from the first. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1235</b></p><p><b>1235.</b>
Verse 24. And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber. "Arpachshad" was a nation so called, by which is signified memory-knowledge; "Shelah" likewise was a nation so called, by which is signified 
that which is derived from this memory-knowledge; by "Eber" also a nation is signified, the father of which was Eber, one who was called by this name, by whom there is signified a second Ancient Church, 
which was separate from the former one. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1235</b></p><p><b>1235.</b>
Verse 24 And Arpachshad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber. </p>
<p>'Arpachshad' was a nation so named which means knowledge. 'Shelah' likewise was a nation so named which means that which is the product 
of such knowledge. 'Eber' means a nation as well, whose father was thus named Eber, and by whom was meant the second Ancient Church which was separate from the previous Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1235</b>
</p><b>1235.</b>
Vers. 24.  Et Arpachshad genuit Shelahum, et Shelah genuit Eberum.  'Arpachshad' fuit gens ita appellata per quam significatur scientia:  'Shelah' similiter fuit gens ita appellata per quam significatur 
id quod est scientiae inde:  per 'Eberum' significatur quoque gens, cujus pater fuit Eberus, ita nomine vocatus; per quem significatur Antiqua Ecclesia altera quae separata a priore. </p>
