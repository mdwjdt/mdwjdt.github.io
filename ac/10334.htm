<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10334节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10334</strong>.“能雕刻木头，能作各样的工作”表为了代表各种良善。这从“雕刻木头”和“各样的工作”的含义清楚可知：“雕像木头”是良善的一个代表，“木”表示良善（参看<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="8354.htm">8354</a>，<a href="9472.htm">9472</a>节）；“各样的工作”是指各种良善。之所以说“各种良善”，是因为良善有许多属和种。既有属天良善，也有属灵良善；既有内层良善，也有外层良善，外层良善存在于属世层和感官层；还有纯真的良善，爱之良善和信之良善。良善必须存在于一切真理里面，好叫它能成为真理。此外，存在于人里面的良善通过真理形成，或说被真理赋予形式；因此，良善变得多样化，并取了多种不同形式，甚至到了没有哪个天使、灵人或世人处于和别人一样的良善。天堂作为一个整体，就在于各种各样的良善。这种多样性使得这一位天使不同于那一位天使；因为如果数位天使拥有同一种良善，那么他们之间就没有区别。这些不同种类的良善被主以这种方式排列成序：它们一起构成一个总体的良善。要知道，神性良善因是无限的，故是一个整体（<a href="10261.htm">10261</a>节）；不过，它与天使、灵人和世人同在的质和量因着它在真理里面的接受而变得各不相同；因为真理限定良善，也就是说，它们赋予良善以具体品质；真理是许许多多，数不清的。</p>

And in carving of wood, to do in all work. That this signifies to represent all manner of good, is evident from the signification of the "carving of wood," as being a representative of good (that "wood" 
denotes good, see n. 643, 2784, 2812, 3720, 8354, 9472); and from the signification of "all work," as being all manner of good. It is said "all manner of good" because there are many genera and species 
of goods. There is celestial good and there is spiritual good; there is good interior and exterior, exterior good being natural and sensuous; there is the good of innocence, the good of love, the 
good of faith. Good must be in all truth in order that it may be truth. Moreover, the good with man is formed by means of truths, consequently good is varied and becomes manifold, so manifold indeed 
that no angel, no spirit, and no man, is in like good with another. The universal heaven consists in variety as to good, and by this variety one is distinguished from another. For if a number had the 
same good, there would be no distinction; but these various goods are so ordered by the Lord that together they constitute one general good. Be it known that the Divine good is one, because infinite 
(n. 10261); but that with angels, spirits, and men, it is varied in quality and quantity by its reception in truths; for truths qualify good, that is, give to good its quality; and truths are manifold. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10334</b></p><p><b>10334.</b>
'And in the carving of wood to work in all [manner of] work' means in order to represent every type of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the carving of wood' as that which is representative of 
good, for good is meant by 'wood', see <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="8354.htm">8354</a>, <a href="9472.htm">9472</a>; and from the meaning of 'all [manner of] work' as every type. The expression 'every type of good' is used because there are very 
many genera and species of good. There is celestial good and there is spiritual good. There is interior good and exterior; exterior good exists on the natural level and the level of the senses. There 
is the good of innocence, the good of love, and the good of faith. Good must be present within all truth, if it is to be truth. But also the good present in a person is given form by truths, which 
causes good to be various and take a multitude of different forms, to such an extent that no angel, spirit, or man is governed by the same good as that governing another. Heaven as a whole consists in 
various types of good. This variation makes one angel different from another; for if the same good existed with more there would be no difference between them. But those various types of good are arranged 
into order by the Lord, in such a way that all together form one overall body of good. It should be remembered that Divine Good, being infinite, is a single whole, <a href="10261.htm">10261</a>; but the character and 
amount of it as it exists with angels, spirits, and men is made various by its reception within truths. For the truths qualify the good, that is, they give it its specific quality; and truths are many 
and numerous.  </p>

`Et in sculptura ligni ad faciendum in omni opere': quod significet ad repraesentandum bonum quodcumque, constat ex significatione `sculpturae ligni' quod sit repraesentativum boni; quod `lignum' sit 
bonum, videatur n. 643, 2784, 2812, 3720, 8354, (x)9472; et ex significatione `omnis operis' quod sit quodcumque. Bonum quodcumque dicitur, quia bonorum sunt plura genera et (x)species; est bonum caeleste 
et bonum spirituale; est bonum interius et exterius, exterius est naturale et sensuale; est bonum innocentiae, bonum amoris, bonum fidei; {1}bonum erit in omni vero ut sit verum; et quoque bonum 
apud hominem formatur per vera, inde bonum variatur, et fit multiplex, ac {2}ita multiplex ut nullus angelus, nullus spiritus, (c)et nullus homo, sit in simili bono in quo alter; universum caelum in 
varietate quoad bonum consistit, per varietatem illam distinguitur unus ab altero, nam si idem bonum esset pluribus, nulla distinctio foret; sed varia illa bona ordinantur ita a Domino, ut simul unum 
bonum commune constituant; sciendum est quod Divinum Bonum sit unum, quia infinitum, n. 10,261, sed variatur apud angelos, spiritus, et homines, quoad quale et quantum ex receptione in veris, nam vera 
qualificant bonum, hoc est, dant bono suum quale, ac vera sunt multiplicia. @1 et in omni vero erit bonum$ @2 d ita i tum$ </p>
