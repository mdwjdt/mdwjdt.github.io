<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4513.</strong>创世记34:30，31.雅各对西缅和利未说，你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中，就是在迦南人和比利洗人中，有了臭名。我的人丁既然稀少，他们必聚集来击杀我，我和全家的人都必灭绝。他们说，他岂可待我们的妹子如同妓女吗？<br />“雅各说”表外在的古教会。“对西缅和利未”表属灵和属天事物的代表。“你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中有了臭名”表那些属古教会的人憎恶他们。“就是在迦南人和比利洗人中”表那些处于良善与真理的人。“我的人丁既然稀少”表这会很容易。“他们必聚集来击杀我，我必灭绝”表古教会就要如此灭亡。“我和全家”表示真理与良善方面。“他们说”表回答。“他岂可待我们的妹子如同妓女吗”表他们没有（对真理的）情感。</p>

Verses 30, 31. And Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink to the inhabitant of the land, to the Canaanite and the Perizzite; and I am mortals [few] of number, and 
they will be gathered together upon me, and will smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. And they said, Shall he make our sister as a harlot? "And Jacob said," signifies the external Ancient 
Church; "to Simeon and to Levi," signifies the representative of spiritual and celestial things; "Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink to the inhabitant of the land," signifies that those who were 
of the Ancient Church would abhor them; "to the Canaanite and the Perizzite," signifies who were in good and truth; "and I am mortals [few] of number," signifies that it would be easy; "and they will 
be gathered together upon me, and will smite me, and I shall be destroyed," signifies that thus the Ancient Church would perish; "I and my house," signifies as to truth and good; "and they said," 
signifies reply; "Shall he make our sister as a harlot?" signifies that they had no affection. </p>

Verses 30, 31 And Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, You have brought trouble on me, by making me stink to the inhabitant of the land, to the Canaanite and the Perizzite; and I am [a few] mortals in number, 
and they will be gathered together against me and will smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. And they said, Is he going to treat our sister like a prostitute? </p>
<p>'Jacob said' means 
the external Ancient Church. 'To Simeon and Levi' means that which was the representative of spiritual and celestial things. 'You have brought trouble on me, by making me stink to the inhabitant of 
the land' means that those who belonged to the Ancient Church abominated them. 'To the Canaanite and the Perizzite' means those who are governed by good and truth. 'And I am [a few] mortals in number' 
means that it would be easy.... 'And they will be gathered together against me and will smite me, and I shall be destroyed' means, for the Ancient Church so to perish. 'I and my house' means as regards 
truth and good. 'And they said' means the reply. 'Is he going to treat our sister like a prostitute?' means on account of the fact that they had no affection [for truth]. </p>

Vers. 30, 31.  Et dixit Jacob ad Shimeon et ad Levi, Perturbastis me, ad fetere faciendum me habitatori terrae, Cananaeo et Perizzaeo, et ego mortales numeri; et congregabuntur super me, et percutient 
me, et perdar ego et domus mea.  Et dixerunt, An sicut meretricem faciet sororem nostram? `Dixit Jacob' significat Antiquam Ecclesiam externam: ad Shimeon et Levi' significat repraesentativum 
spiritualium et caelestium: `Perturbastis me, ad fetere faciendum me habitatori terrae' significat quod abominarentur illi qui ab Ecclesia Antiqua: `Cananaeo et Perizzaeo' significat qui in bono et 
vero: `e ego mortales numeri' significat quod facile: `et congregabuntur super me, et percutient me, et perdar' significat quod sic pereat Ecclesia Antiqua: `ego et domus mea' significat quoad verum 
et bonum: e dixerunt' significat responsum: `An sicut meretricem faciet sororem nostram?' significat propter quod nulla illis affectio. </p>
