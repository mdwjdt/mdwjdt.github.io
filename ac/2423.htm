<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2423节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2423.</strong>“看哪，你仆人既然在你眼前蒙恩”表由对真理的情感所产生的谦卑；“你又向我大施怜悯”表由对良善的情感所产生的谦卑的表象。这从前面有关恩典和怜悯的论述清楚可知（<a href="598.htm">598</a>，<a href="981.htm">981</a>节）。因为人若处于对真理的情感，是不可能足以谦卑到发自内心承认万事万物皆出于怜悯的。正因如此，他们说“蒙恩”，而非“怜悯”。事实上，他们里面对真理的情感越少，在他们提及恩典的里面所包含的谦卑就越少。而另一方面，人所拥有的对良善的情感越多，在他提及怜悯的里面所包含的谦卑就越多。这表明，那些处于对真理的情感之人所具有的崇拜，因而敬拜，与那些处于对良善的情感之人的有何等大的差别。为使敬拜可以存在，崇拜必须存在；为使崇拜可以存在，谦卑也必须存在。这适用于敬拜的方方面面。由此明显可知为何此处既提及恩典，也提及怜悯。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2423</b></p><p><b>2423.</b>
That Behold I pray thy servant hath found grace in thine eyes, signifies humiliation from the affection of truth; and that "thou hast made thy mercy great" signifies a semblance of humiliation from the 
affection of good, is evident from what has been said before concerning "grace" and "mercy" (n. 598, 981). For they who are in the affection of truth cannot humble themselves so far as to acknowledge 
from the heart that all things are of mercy; and therefore, instead of "mercy" they say "grace;" nay, the less of the affection of truth there is in them, the less of humiliation there is in their 
mention of grace; whereas on the other hand, the more of the affection of good there is in anyone, the more of humiliation there is in his mention of mercy. This shows how much the adoration, and consequently 
the worship, that exists with those who are in the affection of truth differs from that which exists with those who are in the affection of good. For in order that there may be worship, there 
must be adoration; and in order that there may be adoration, there must be humiliation; and this in all things of the worship both in general and particular. What has been said will serve to show why 
both "grace" and "mercy" are here mentioned. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2423</b></p><p><b>2423.</b>
'Behold now, your servant has found grace in your eyes' means a state of humility resulting from the affection for truth, and 'you have magnified your mercy' means a likeness of a state of humility resulting 
from the affection for good. This becomes clear from what has been stated already about grace and mercy in <a href="598.htm">598</a>, <a href="981.htm">981</a>. For people governed by an affection for truth are not able to humble themselves 
sufficiently so as to acknowledge from the heart that all things are attributable to mercy; and this being so, instead of mercy they speak of grace. Indeed the less the affection for truth is in 
them, the less humility there is within their mention of grace. On the other hand the more affection for good exists with someone the more humility there is within his mention of mercy. This shows how 
broad the difference is in the adoration and consequently the worship between those governed by the affection for truth and those governed by the affection for good. For in order that worship may exist, 
adoration must exist, and in order that adoration may exist humility must do so too. This applies to every single aspect of worship. From this it is evident why both grace and mercy are mentioned here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2423</b>
</p><b>2423.</b>
`Ecce quaeso invenit servus tuus gratiam in oculis tuis': quod significet humiliationem ex affectione veri, `et magnam fecisti misericordiam tuam', quod significet humiliationis instar ex affectione 
boni, constare potest ex illis quae de gratia et misericordia prius n. 598, 985 dicta sunt: qui enim in affectione veri sunt, non possunt eo usque se humiliare ut ex corde agnoscant omnia esse misericordiae, 
quare loco ejus gratiam dicunt; immo quo minus affectionis veri apud eos est, eo minus humiliationis in nominatione gratiae inest; vicissim autem, quo plus affectionis boni apud aliquem est, 
eo plus humiliationis est ei in nominatione misericordiae: ex eo patet quantum differt adoratio, proinde cultus, apud eos qui in affectione veri sunt, ab eorum qui in affectione boni; nam ut cultus sit, 
erit adoratio, et ut adoratio, erit humiliatio, et hoc in omnibus et singulis cultus; inde patet cur hic dicatur et gratia et misericordia. </p>
