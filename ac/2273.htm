<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2273.</strong> “祂说，为这四十个的缘故，我也不毁灭这城”表他们会得救。这是显而易见的，无需解释。关于前一节“四十五”所表示的那些人，经上说“我若找到四十五个，就不毁灭这城”，这句话表示若良善能与真理结合，他们就不会灭亡。而接下来的这一节与“四十”相关，经上说“为这四十个的缘故，我也不毁灭这城”，这句话并不是说人们仅仅由于试探就会得救，因为有些人在试探中屈服了，所以对他们而言，良善并未与真理结合。事实上，若将功德置于试探中，谁都不会因试探而得救。他若这样做，就是出于自我之爱而行。因为他夸耀他的试探，相信自己比其他人更配上天堂，同时认为自己优于其他人，与自己相比看不起别人。所有这些都违背相爱，因而违背天堂的幸福。<br />人所战胜的试探伴随这样的信念，即其他所有人都比他更有价值，相比天堂里的人，他更像地狱里的人。因为在试探期间，这类观念会呈现给他。因此，试探过后，他会进入与这些相反的思维中，这表明他还没有得胜。因为此人在试探期间所曾有过的思维就是他在试探之后所拥有的思维能转向的思维。但是，若他在试探后所拥有的思维没能转向他在试探期间曾有过的思维，那么他要么在试探中屈服了，要么又再次进入类似试探，有时会进入更严重的试探，直到他变得神志正常，以至于相信他什么也不配。由此清楚可知，“四十”表那些良善已通过试探与真理结合之人。</p>

And He said, I will not do it for forty's sake. That this signifies that they will be saved, is evident without any unfolding of the meaning. As regards those who in the preceding verse are signified 
by "forty-five," it was said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty and five," and the signification was that they should not perish if goods were able to be conjoined with truths, and there here follows 
a statement concerning the forty: "I will not do it for forty's sake;" by which is not signified that they should be saved on account of temptations, for there are some who even undergo temptations 
and who yield in them; and therefore with these goods are not conjoined. I would even say that a man is not saved on account of temptations if he places anything of merit in them; for if he does this, 
it is from the love of self, in that he congratulates himself on their account, and believes that he has merited heaven more than others, and at the same time he is thinking of his own preeminence 
over others by despising others in comparison with himself; all of which things are contrary to mutual love, and therefore to heavenly blessedness. [2] The temptations in which a man overcomes are 
attended with a belief that all others are more worthy than himself, and that he is infernal rather than heavenly; for while in temptations such ideas are presented to him; and therefore when after temptations 
he comes into thoughts contrary to these, it is an indication that he has not overcome; for the thoughts which the man has had in temptations are those to which can be bent the thoughts which 
he has after the temptations; and if the latter cannot be bent to the former, the man has either yielded in the temptation, or he again comes into similar ones, and sometimes into more grievous ones, 
until he has been reduced to such sanity that he believes he has merited nothing. Hence it is evident that by "forty" are here signified those with whom by means of temptations goods have been conjoined 
with truths. </p>

That 'He said, I will not do it for the sake of the forty' means that they will be saved is clear without explanation. Regarding those who are meant by 'the forty-five' in the previous verse, it was 
said, 'I will not destroy it if I find forty-five', which meant that they would not perish if goods could be joined to truths. In the verse that follows here which has regard to 'the forty' it is said, 
'I will not do it for the sake of the forty', which does not mean that people would be saved merely because of temptations, for there are some undergoing temptations who give way, so that in their case 
goods are not joined to truths. Nor indeed is anyone saved because of temptations if he places any merit in them, for if he places any merit in temptations he does so from self-love, in that he boasts 
about his temptations and believes that he has merited heaven more than others, and at the same time he is thinking about his own pre-eminence over others, despising others in comparison with himself, 
all of which is contrary to mutual love and consequently to heavenly blessedness. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The temptations in which a person is victorious entail the belief that all others are more worthy than he, 
and that he is more like those in hell than those in heaven, for ideas such as these present themselves to him in temptations. When therefore after temptations a person enters into ways of thinking 
that are contrary to this outlook it is a sign that he has not been victorious, for the thoughts he had in temptations are those towards which the thoughts that he has following temptations can be turned. 
But if the thoughts he has after temptations cannot be turned in the direction of those he had during them, he has either given way in temptation, or he has departed into similar, and sometimes graver 
ones, till he has been brought to that healthier outlook in which he believes he has merited nothing. From this it is clear that 'forty' means people with whom by means of temptations goods have 
been joined to truths. </p>

</p><b>2273.</b>
Quod `dixit, Non faciam propter quadraginta' significet quod salvabuntur, constat absque explicatione: de illis qui significantur per `quadraginta quinque' in versu praecedente, dictum est quod `non 
perdam si invenero quadraginta quinque,' et significatum quod non perirent, si bona veris conjungi possent; hic nunc sequitur de `quadraginta,' et dicitur `non faciam propter quadraginta,' quo non significatur 
quod salvarentur propter tentationes, nam quidam etiam tentationes subeunt qui in iis succumbunt, ita non conjunguntur apud eos bona [veris]; immo nec propter tentationes salvatur homo si aliquid 
meriti in iis ponit, nam si aliquid meriti in tentationibus ponit, est ex amore sui, quod se inde jactet et credat se prae aliis meruisse caelum, et simul de praeeminentia sui prae aliis cogitat, 
contemnendo alios prae se, quae omnia amori mutuo et inde beatitudini caelesti contraria sunt; [2] tentationes in quibus homo vincit, secum habent quod omnes alios se digniores credat, et quod potius 
infernalis sit quam caelestis, talia enim ei obveniunt in tentationibus; cum itaque post tentationes in contrarias illis cogitationes venit, indicium est quod non vicerit, nam cogitationes quas habuit 
in tentationibus, sunt ad quas flecti possint cogitationes quas habet post tentationes, et si hae ad illas non flecti possint, vel succubuit in tentatione, vel recurrit in similes, et quandoque in 
graviores, usque dum redactus sit ad illam sanitatem quod credat se nihil meruisse: inde constat quod per `quadraginta' hic significentur illi apud quos per tentationes bona conjuncta sint veris. </p>
