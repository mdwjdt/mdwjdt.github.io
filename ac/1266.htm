<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1266节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1266.</strong>洪水前灭亡的人在左脚跟下面的某个地狱。关闭他们的，是笼罩在雾霭中的一块岩石，那是他们的可怕幻觉和信念投射出来的，他们以此与其它地狱隔离，并与灵人界保持隔绝。他们一直迫切地从那里出来，但均未奏效。因为他们具有这样的性质，倘若真的进入灵人界，除了善灵外，他们会用其可怕幻觉及其信念的窒息和毒液夺走凡所遇见的所有灵人的思维能力。若非主以肉身降临，将灵人界从这伙穷凶极恶的人中释放出来，人类必要灭亡。因为没有灵人能与人同在。然而，若灵人和天使不与人同在，人片刻不能存活。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1266.</strong> The pre-Flood people who were annihilated are in a certain hell under the heel of the left foot. A kind of foggy crag that materializes out of their monstrous hallucinations and delusions covers them, separating them from the other hells and putting distance between them and the world of spirits.<br />They are constantly trying to rise up out of there, but they can accomplish nothing more than the attempt. Their nature is such that if they reached the world of spirits, their dreadful hallucinations and the toxic fumes and poisons of their delusions would deprive all the spirits they came across (except the good ones) of the ability to think. Had the Lord not freed the world of spirits from that unspeakable mob by coming in the flesh, the human race would have been destroyed. This is because no spirit could have been present with people on earth, and we cannot survive for even a moment if there are no spirits and angels with us. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1266</b></p><p><b>1266.</b>
The antediluvians who perished are in a certain hell beneath the heel of the left foot.* There is a kind of misty rock with which they are covered, that is projected from their direful phantasies and 
persuasions, and by which they are separated from the other hells, and are kept away from the world of spirits. They are in the continual effort to rise out of it, but cannot get beyond the effort; for 
they are of such a nature that if they should come into the world of spirits, they, by their direful phantasies and the exhalations and venom of their persuasions, would take away the faculty of thinking 
from all the spirits they met, except the good. And unless the Lord, by His coming into the flesh, had liberated the world of spirits from this nefarious crew, the human race would have perished; 
for no spirit could have been with man, and yet if spirits and angels are not with man, he cannot live a moment. * The author speaks of places in the spiritual world as being situated in accordance 
with their correspondence to the human body. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1266</b></p><p><b>1266.</b>
Those before the Flood who perished are in a certain hell beneath the heel of the left foot. Shutting them in is a rock enveloped in mist which is a projection of their dreadful delusions and persuasions, 
and by which they are segregated from all other hells and kept apart from the world of spirits They are continually pressing to come up out of there but can never get beyond the attempt to do so. 
For they are such that if they were to enter the world of spirits with their dreadful delusions and with the choking and toxic effects of their persuasions, they would deprive every spirit they met, 
apart from good ones, of his ability to think. And if the Lord by His Coming in the flesh had not freed the world of spirits of that abominable crew the human race would have perished Indeed no spirit 
could have stayed with man, and yet man cannot live a single moment unless spirits and angels are with him. </p>

</p><b>1266.</b>
Antediluviani qui perierunt, sunt in inferno quodam sub calcaneo pedis sinistri; est quaedam petra nimbosa qua operti, quae ex diris eorum phantasiis et persuasionibus erumpit, qua separantur a reliquis 
infernis, et distinentur a mundo spirituum:  est iis continuus nisus exsurgendi, sed ultra conatum non procedere possunt; sunt enim tales ut si venirent in mundum spirituum diris suis phantasiis 
et persuasionum halitibus et venenis, omnibus spiritibus quos offenderent, praeter bonos, adimerent facultatem cogitandi; et nisi Dominus per Adventum Ipsius in carnem, liberavisset mundum spirituum a 
nefanda illa turba, periisset genus humanum; nullus enim spiritus apud hominem potuisset esse, et usque homo ne momentum temporis vivere potest nisi spiritus et angeli apud eum sint. </p>
