<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第671节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>671.</strong>“每样一对，你要带进方舟”表这些事物的重生。这一点从有关前一节的解读明显可知，大意是，真理只能通过良善和快乐得以重生。因此，信之物只能通过仁爱之物得以重生。为此，经上说所有的“每样一对”进入方舟，即属觉知的真理和属意愿的良善。 未重生者没有对真理的觉知，或对良善的意愿，只是看似有，在日常说话时被如此称谓。然而，他能接受理性真理和知识真理，但它们不是活的。他还有可能拥有一种诸如存在于外邦人，甚至动物中的良善意愿。但这些也不是活的，它们只是类似。人里面的这类良善决不是活的，除非他得以重生，它们由此被主复活。在来生（即灵界），有生命之物和无生命之物会清楚地被感知到。不是活的真理立时被感知为物质化、纤维状和被封闭之物；不是活的良善则被感知为木制、骨状和石头似的东西。而被主复活的真理和良善则是开放、有活力的，充满属灵属天之物，它们甚至通过主自己开放。这适用于每一个观念和每一个行为，甚至它们任意一个最小细节。这就是为何此处经文说“每样一对进入方舟，好保全生命”的原因。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]671.</strong> The symbolism of you must bring pairs of each into the ark to keep them alive as the regeneration of these entities can be seen from remarks on the previous verse. There it was said that truth can be regenerated only by what is good and pleasurable, and the attributes of faith, therefore, only by the qualities of charity. In consequence the present verse says "pairs of each must go in," or to be specific, both something of the truth that inhabits the intellect and something of the goodness that inhabits the will.<br />People who have not been reborn have neither an understanding of truth nor a will to do good. (They only appear to have them, although they do have faculties that everyone calls by those names.) They are indeed capable of grasping truth on the rational and factual levels, but such truth is not alive. They are also seemingly able to will what is good, but the goodness is not living. It is like the good deeds that non-Christians do, or even like the good actions of unreasoning animals, and these are merely analogous to good. Truth and goodness can never come to life in us before we regenerate and so before the Lord gives them life.<br />In the other world people can easily tell what is not alive and what is alive. When they come across truth that is not living, they immediately sense it as something material, fibrous, and shut off. When they come across goodness that is not living, they perceive it as something wooden, bonelike, or stony. The truth and goodness that the Lord has brought to life, though, is open, vibrant, and full of spiritual and heavenly essence, offering unhindered access all the way to the Lord. It displays this nature in every idea and action, down to the tiniest aspects. This, then, is the reason the verse says that pairs were to enter the ark to be kept alive. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 671</b></p><p><b>671.</b>
Pairs of all shalt thou make to enter into the ark, to keep them alive. That this signifies their regeneration, is evident from what has been said in connection with the preceding verse: that truths 
cannot be regenerated except through goods and delights; nor therefore the things of faith, except through those which are of charity. And for this reason it is said here that "pairs" of all should enter 
in, that is, both of truths which are of the understanding, and of goods which are of the will. A man who is not regenerated has no understanding of truth or will of good, but only what appear to 
be such, and in common speech are so called. He can however receive truths of reason and of knowledge [vera rationalia et scientifica], but they are not living. He may also have a kind of goods of the 
will, such as exist in the Gentiles, and even in brutes, but neither are these living; they are merely analogous. Such goods in man are not living until he is regenerated and they are thus made alive 
by the Lord. In the other life it is very manifestly perceived what is not alive and what is alive. Truth that is not alive is instantly perceived as something material, fibrous, closed up; and good 
not alive, as something woody, bony, stony. But truth and good made living by the Lord are open, vital, full of the spiritual and celestial, open and manifest even from the Lord; and this in every idea 
and in every act, yea, in the least of either of them. This then is why it is said that pairs should enter into the ark, to keep them alive. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 671</b></p><p><b>671.</b>
'Pairs of all you shall cause to enter the ark to keep them alive means the regeneration of these. This becomes clear from what has been stated in the previous verse, to the effect that truths cannot 
be regenerated except by means of goods and delights. Nor therefore can things of faith be regenerated except through those of charity. Hence the statement here about pairs of all having to enter, clearly 
meaning that both truths, which belong to the understanding, and goods, which belong to the will, were to do so. With someone who has not yet been regenerated an understanding of truth and a will 
for good do not exist but merely appear to do so, and are referred to as such in everyday speech. It is possible for rational truths and for facts to exist with that person, but these have no life. 
It is also possible for goods which merely look like those of the will, such as those present with gentiles or even with animals, to exist there. But these have no life either; they are merely semblances. 
With man such things are in no sense alive until he has been regenerated and they have in this way been made alive by the Lord. In the next life what has life and what does not is perceived very 
distinctly. Truth that has no life is perceived instantly as something material, all tangled and closed up, while good that has no life is perceived as something wooden, bony, and stone-like. But truth 
or good made alive by the Lord is open, living, and full of what is spiritual and celestial - open even from the Lord Himself. This applies to every idea and action, even to the smallest of either of 
them. This is why the statement is here made about pairs having to enter the ark to keep them alive. </p>

</p><b>671.</b>
Quod 'paria ex omni intrare facies in arcam ad vivificandum' significent regenerationem eorum, constare potest ab illis quae in versu praecedente dicta, quod vera non regenerari queant nisi per bona 
et jucunda, ita quae sunt fidei non nisi quam per illa quae sunt charitatis; quare hic dicitur quod 'paria ex omni intrarent,' tam scilicet ex veris quae sunt intellectus, quam ex bonis quae sunt voluntatis. 
 Apud hominem non regeneratum non datur intellectus veri aut voluntas boni, sed modo apparent sicut forent; etiam ita in communi sermone vocantur; sed apud illum dari possunt vera rationalia 
et scientifica, sed non sunt viva; dari quoque possunt quasi voluntaria bona, sed non sunt viva, similia sicut apud gentes; immo apud bruta; sed sunt modo analoga: apud hominem talia nusquam sunt viva 
priusquam regeneratus est et sic vivificata a Domino: in altera vita manifestissime percipitur quid non vivum, et quid vivum; verum quod non vivum, percipitur ilico sicut materiale quoddam filamentosum, 
clausum: bonum non vivum, sicut quoddam ligneum, osseum, lapideum; at verum et bonum a Domino vivificatum, est apertum, vitale, plenum spirituali et caelesti, patens usque a Domino, et hoc in unaquavis 
idea et actione, etiam in minimo utriusque; ideo nunc dicitur quod 'paria intrarent in arcam ad vivificandum.' </p>
