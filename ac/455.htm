<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第455节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>455.</strong>有一个人在世时精通圣言，他所持的观点是，天堂之乐在于荣光，就象金色阳光发出的光芒。因此，对他来说，天堂之乐也在于生活的安逸。所以为了让他认清自己的错误，他被赐予这样的光芒，并发觉自己就在其中。如他自己所言，开始时他感觉非常快乐，仿佛身在天堂。但他无法长时间呆在那里，因为他最后厌倦了它，它也不再给予他任何快乐。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]455.</strong> One of the people reputed most knowledgeable about the Word when he lived in the world had developed an idea of heavenly joy as consisting in a glorious ring of light like the circle of golden rays beaming from the sun. As in the previous example, this dream life of his involved inactivity. To awaken him to his misconception, he was granted this kind of light, and as he stood at its center he felt so much pleasure that, as he himself declared, it was like being in heaven. He could not linger there long, however, because little by little it grew tiresome for him and turned into no joy at all. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 455</b></p><p><b>455.</b>
One who in this world had been most learned in regard to the Word, had the idea that heavenly joy consists in being in a glorious light, like that which exists when the solar rays appear of a golden 
hue, so that he too supposed it to consist in a life of ease. In order that he might know himself to be in error, such a light was granted him, and he, being in the midst of the light, was as delighted 
as if he were in heaven, as indeed he said. But he could not remain long in it, for it gradually wearied him and became no joy at all. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 455</b></p><p><b>455.</b>
A certain person who during his lifetime had been one of those very well-versed in the Word had adopted the idea that heavenly joy consisted in glorious light, like the light produced when rays of sunshine 
look golden. Thus for him also heavenly joy consisted in a life of idleness. So that he might recognize that he was mistaken he was granted such light and found himself in the midst of it. So delighted 
was he then that, as he himself said, it was as though he was in heaven. But he was unable to stay there for very long, since he eventually grew tired of it, and it ceased to give him any joy.  </p>

</p><b>455.</b>
Quidam inter instructissimos in Verbo cum vixit in mundo, talem ideam de gaudio caelesti habuit quod consisteret in lumine gloriae, sicut lumen cum radii solares aurei apparent; ita quoque in vita otiosa: 
ut nosset quod in falso, datum ei erat tale lumen, et is in medio lumine; tunc ita delectatus, sicut, ut quoque dixit, in caelo esset; sed ibi non diu subsistere potuit, nam paulatim taeduit eum, 
et factum nullum gaudium. </p>
