<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4952节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4952.</strong>那些属世的人当中，有的说，他们不知道该信什么，因为命运照各人的生活，也照由他所坚信的基本观念所产生的思维而等待着各人。但我告诉他们说，他们只要相信神主宰万物，死后还有生命，尤其是没有像野兽而是像人那样生活，也就是说，处于对神之爱和对邻之仁，因而处于真理与良善，而非反对它们，就足够了。但这些人说，他们一直过着这样的生活；于是我再次回答说，他们只是在外在行为上这样做。如果没有法律的阻拦，他们会侵犯每个人的生命和财产，比野兽还要凶猛。对此，他们回答说，他们不知道何为对邻之仁，也不知道何为内在；但我回答说，他们不可能知道这些事，因为自我之爱和尘世之爱，以及外在事物已经占据了他们全部的思维和意愿。</p>

Some of those who are natural have said that they know not what to believe, because a lot awaits everyone according to his life, and also according to his thoughts from confirmed principles; but it was 
answered them that it would  have sufficed if they had believed that it is God who governs all things, and that there is a life after death; and especially if they had lived not as a wild beast, but 
as a man, that is, in love to God and in charity toward the neighbor; and thus in truth and in good, but not contrary to them. But they said that they had so lived; but again it was answered that in 
externals they had appeared to do so, when nevertheless had not the laws opposed, they would have invaded everyone's life and property with more fury than wild beasts. They again said that they did not 
know what charity toward the neighbor is, nor what the internal is; but it was answered them that they could not know these things because the love of self and of the world, and external things, had 
engrossed the whole of their thought and will. </p>

Some of those who are natural, have said that they do not know what to believe, for a destiny awaits everyone in keeping with the life he has led and also in keeping with his thoughts that result from 
the basic ideas of which he is firmly convinced. But I have told them in reply that it would have been sufficient if they had believed that God is the one who governs all things and that there is a 
life after death. In particular it would have been sufficient if they had not lived like a wild animal but as a human being should; that is to say, if they had loved God and exercised charity towards 
their neighbour, and had accordingly welcomed what was good and true and not been opposed to it, These people have then said that they had led that kind of life, but I have again replied that they had 
done so only in external actions. If laws had not stood in their way they would have made an attack on everyone's life and wealth in a fiercer way than any animal. To this they have responded that they 
had not known what charity towards the neighbour was nor known about anything internal, but I answered that they could not know these things because self-love and love of the world, also external interests, 
had occupied their entire thought and will. </p>

Quidam ex illis qui naturales sunt, dixerunt quod nesciant quid credituri, quia sors manet unumquemvis secundum vitam, et quoque secundum cogitationes ex confirmatis principiis {1}; sed illis responsum 
quod satis fuerit illis si crediderint quod Deus sit Qui gubernat omnia, et quod vita post mortem sit; et imprimis quod vixerint non sicut fera sed sicut homo, nempe in amore in Deum et in charitate 
erga proximum, ita in vero et bono, non autem contra illa {2}. At dixerunt quod ita vixerint, sed iterum responsum quod in externis apparuerint tales, sed nisi obstiterint leges, in cujusvis 
vitam et opes ruissent saevius quam ferae. {2} Rursus dixerunt quod non sciverint quid charitas erga proximum et quid internum {3}, sed illis responsum quod illa non scire potuerint quia amor sui 
et mundi et externa occupaverant omnia cogitationis et voluntatis eorum. @1 principia$ @2 n. 4053 was written here but deleted, and the paragraph continued.$ @3 i sit$ </p>
