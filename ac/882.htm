<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第882节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>882.</strong>“再继续把鸽子从方舟放出去”表接受信之良善与真理的状态。这一点从前面有关第8节的论述清楚可知，其中也有类似的话，区别在于，第8节说的是“他又从他自己那里放出一只鸽子”。至于原因，那里解释说，那时他凭自己行真与善，也就是说，他以为是凭自己的力量，这就是“从他自己那里”所表之义。 </p>

<p><strong>[NCE]882.</strong> The symbolism of and he proceeded to send the dove out from the ark as the right conditions for taking in the goodness and truth of faith can be deduced from statements made at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_882/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_8" target=_top>8</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_882/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_871" target=_top>871</a>], where the words are almost the same. A difference is that verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_882/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_8" target=_top>8</a> says he sent the dove out from himself. The reason for the difference is also given there:{*1} The people under discussion were at that time putting truth and goodness into action under their own direction — they believed they were exercising their own, independent powers — which is doing so from oneself.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The explanation that follows actually comes in the discussion of verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_882/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_9" target=_top>9</a>; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_882/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_878" target=_top>878</a>.

And again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. That this signifies a state of receiving the goods and truths of faith, is evident from what was said at the eighth verse, where similar words occur, 
but with the difference that it is there said, he sent forth the dove "from him;" for the reason there explained, that at that time he did what was true and good from himself, that is, he believed it 
to be from his own power, which is meant by the words "from him." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 882</b></p><p><b>882.</b>
'And he proceeded to send out the dove from the ark' means a state of receiving the goods and truths of faith. This is clear from what has been stated at verse 8 where nearly identical words appear, 
with the difference that there it is said 'he sent out the dove from himself', for the reason also given there, that at that time he himself was the source of every work of truth or good which he performed. 
That is to say, he believed that he performed it by his own power, meant by 'from himself'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 882</b>
</p><b>882.</b>
'Et perrexit emittere columbam de arca': quod significet statum recipiendi bona et vera fidei, constat ab illis quae dicta sunt ad vers. 8, ubi similia fere verba sunt, sed cum differentia quod ibi 
dicatur quod 'emiserit columbam a secum,' ex causa de qua etiam ibi quod tunc operatus sit verum et bonum a semet, seu quod crediderit ex propria potentia, quod est 'a secum.' </p>
