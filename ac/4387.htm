<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4387节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4387.</strong>“于是以扫在那一天返回原路，回往西珥去了”表神性属世良善已经与真理之良善联结时的状态；“路”表与那良善相比之时的真理之良善。这从“天”、“路”和“西珥”的含义，以及“以扫”的代表清楚可知：“天”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>节），因此，他“在那一天返回”表示那时它所具有的状态；“以扫”是指神性属世良善，如前所述（<a href="4340.htm">4340</a>节）；“路”是指真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节），在此是指真理之良善，也就是意愿和行为中的真理（<a href="4337.htm">4337</a>，<a href="4353.htm">4353</a>节）；“西珥”是指真理与良善的结合（参看<a href="4384.htm">4384</a>节）。这些不同含义合成一个意思时就表明这些话表示神性属世良善已经与真理之良善联结时的状态。<br />从这些话的历史意义很难看出它们表示这类概念。然而，就灵义或内义而言，它们的确具有这类概念在里面。因为人里面的天堂，也就是与他同在的天使对涉及这个世界历史的细节一点也不感兴趣；他们也不知道以扫是谁，西珥是什么东西；不会思想以扫返回的日子，或往西珥去的路；相反，他们会从与这些历史事实相对应的属灵事物中获得概念，并立刻从中提取这种灵义。因为对应以下列方式作工：它们很像一个人用外语说话，其倾听者马上就明白是什么意思，仿佛用的是他自己的母语，而这些话的声音和发音对他来说没有任何障碍。圣言的内义也是如此，内义与天使所用的普遍语言，也就是表达他们思想的属灵言语完全一致。他们的言语是属灵的，因为他们的思想来自从主放射的天堂之光。</p>

And Esau returned in that day unto his way, unto Seir. That this signifies the state then of the Divine good natural to which the goods of truth were adjoined, is evident from the signification of "day," 
as being state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462), whence his returning in that day denotes the state which it then put on; from the representation of Esau, as being Divine good natural 
(see n. 4340); from the signification of "way," as being truth in the will and act (n. 4337, 4353); and from the signification of " Seir," as being the conjunction of truth with good (see above, n. 4384); 
from all which, brought together into one sense, it is evident that by these words is signified the state then of Divine good natural to which the goods of truth were adjoined.  [2] That these things 
are signified by these words is by no means apparent from their historical sense, but nevertheless these are the things involved in the spiritual or internal sense. For heaven, which is in man, 
that is, the angels who are with him, care nothing whatever for worldly historicals, neither do they know what Esau was, nor Seir, and neither do they think of the day which Esau returned, nor of the 
way to Seir; but from the spiritual things which correspond to them they receive ideas, and instantly draw from them such a sense; for this is effected by the correspondences, which are circumstanced 
almost as when anyone is speaking in a foreign tongue, and his hearer instantly understands the meaning as if from his own; nor is he hindered by the words having a foreign sound and articulation. So 
is it with the internal sense of the Word, which coincides altogether with the universal language in which the angels are, or with the spiritual speech of their thought. Their speech is spiritual, because 
their thought is from the light of heaven, which is from the Lord. </p>

'And Esau returned on that day on his own way, to Seir' means the state at that time of Divine Natural Good to which the goods of truth had been linked. This is clear from the meaning of 'day' as state, 
dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a> - hence 'he returned on that day' means the state which it assumed at that point; from the representation of 'Esau' as Divine Natural Good, dealt with 
above in <a href="4340.htm">4340</a>; from the meaning of 'way' as truth, dealt with in <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>, in this case the good of truth, which is truth in will and action, <a href="4337.htm">4337</a>, <a href="4353.htm">4353</a>; and from the meaning of 'Seir' as the joining 
of truth to good, dealt with above in <a href="4384.htm">4384</a>. These different meanings when drawn together to give one overall sense show that the words used here mean the state at that time of Divine Natural Good 
to which the goods of truth had been linked. </p>

 It is not at all apparent from the historical sense of these words that such ideas are meant by them. All the same, it is just these ideas that those 
words hold within them in the spiritual or internal sense. For heaven, which is within man - that is, the angels who reside with him - do not have the slightest interest in details to do with the history 
of the world. Neither do they know who or what Esau was, who or what Seir was. Nor do they have any thought of the day when Esau returned or of the way to Seir; instead they gather ideas of the 
spiritual things which correspond to those historical facts, instantly deriving such a spiritual meaning from them For correspondences work in the following way: They are very much like a person talking 
in a foreign language to someone else who instantly understands what is meant as if in his own language, the sounds and pronunciation of the words actually used being no hindrance to him. So it is 
with the internal sense of the Word, which sense is in perfect agreement with the universal language which angels use, that is, with the spiritual speech which is expressive of their thought. Their speech 
is spiritual because their thought is a product of the light of heaven which shines from the Lord </p>

`Et reversus in die illo Esau ad viam suam, ad Seir': quod significet statum Divini Boni Naturalis tunc cui adjuncta veri bona, constat ex significatione `diei {1}' quod sit status, de qua {2} n. 
23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, inde `reversus in die illo' est status quem tunc induerat; ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit Divinum Bonum Naturale, de qua supra n. 4340; ex significatione 
`viae' quod sit verum [de qua n. 627, 2333; hic veri bonum, quod est verum] voluntate et actu, n. 4337, 4353; et ex significatione `Seir' quod sit conjunctio veri cum bono, de qua supra n. 4384; ex 
quibus, in unum sensum collatis, patet quod per illa verba significetur status Divini Boni Naturalis tunc cui adjuncta veri bona: [2] quod haec significentur per illa verba, haudquaquam apparet ex 
sensu illorum historico, sed usque illa sunt quae in sensu spirituali seu interno involvunt; caelum enim quod in homine est, hoc est, angeli qui apud illum, nihil prorsus curant historica mundana, 
nec sciunt quid Esau, nec quid Seir, etiam nec cogitant de die quo reversus Esau, nec de via ad Seir, sed ex spiritualibus quae illis correspondent, ideas capiunt, ac inde in eodem instanti talem 
sensum hauriunt; correspondentiae enim hoc faciunt, quae paene se habent sicut cum quis loquitur lingua aliena, et alter in instanti sensum sicut ex sua intelligit, nec morantur illum voces aliter 
sonantes et articulatae; ita sensus internus Verbi, qui coincidit prorsus cum lingua universali in qua sunt angeli, seu cum loquela cogitationis illorum spirituali; </p>
<p>loquela illorum est spiritualis, 
quia cogitatio illorum est ex luce `caeli quae a Domino.      @1 viae I$      @2 quo$      @3 caelesti$ </p>
