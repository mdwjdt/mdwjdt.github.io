<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5850节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5850.</strong>事情的真相是这样：有一个普遍流注和一个特定流注从主经由灵界进入自然界的物体。普遍流注进入那些处于秩序的事物，特定流注进入那些未处于秩序的事物。各种动物便活在自己本性的秩序中，所以接受普遍流注。它们活在自己本性的秩序中，这一点从以下事实清楚可知：它们一出生就知道自己需要知道的一切，以致它们不用接受任何训练来获得它们。但人类并未活在秩序中，或活在秩序的任何法则中，所以接受特定流注；也就是说，他们有天使和灵人与其同在，流注便通过这些天使和灵人而来。人类若没有天使和灵人与其同在，就会冲进各种邪恶，立刻投入最深的地狱。人通过这些灵人和天使被保持在主的眷顾和指引之下。人被造所进入的秩序是这样，他当爱邻如己，甚至爱邻胜己。天使就是如此行的。但人类只爱自己和世界，仇恨邻舍，除非他，即他的邻舍纵容他，让他控制世界，给他这个世界。因此，由于人的生活与天堂的秩序完全相反，所以主通过给各人单独的灵人和天使而掌管他。</p>

The truth of the matter is this. From the Lord through the spiritual world into the subjects of the natural world there is a general influx and also a particular influx-a general influx into those things 
which are in order, a particular influx into those things which are not in order. Animals of every kind are in the order of their nature, and therefore into them there is general influx. That they 
are in the order of their nature is evident from the fact that they are born into all their faculties, and have no need to be introduced into them by any information. But men are not in their order, 
nor in any law of order, and therefore they receive particular influx; that is, there are with them angels and spirits through whom the influx comes. And unless these were with men, they would rush into 
every wickedness and would plunge in a moment into the deepest hell. Through these spirits and angels man is kept under the auspices and guidance of the Lord. The order into which man was created 
would be that he should love the neighbor as himself, and even more than himself. Thus do the angels. But man loves only himself and the world, and hates the neighbor, except insofar as he favors his 
commanding and possessing the world. Therefore as the life of man is altogether contrary to heavenly order, he is ruled by the Lord through separate spirits and angels. </p>

The truth of the matter is this: Beginning in the Lord and coming by way of the spiritual world into persons and things in the natural world there is both general influx and particular influx. General 
influx passes into whatever exists in a state of order, particular influx into whatever does not exist in a state of order. Animals of every kind live in the order of their own nature and therefore 
receive general influx. The fact that they live in the order of their own nature is clear from their knowing at birth all they need to know, so that they do not have to receive any training to acquire 
it. But human beings do not live in a state of order or in accordance with any laws of order. Therefore they have the particular influx into them; that is, they have with them angels and spirits through 
whom that influx comes. If human beings did not have the angels and spirits with them they would plunge into every kind of wickedness and hurl themselves instantly into the deepest hell. By means 
of those spirits and angels a person is kept under the Lord's guidance and control. If human beings lived in the state of order in which they were created they would love their neighbour as themselves; 
indeed they would love him more than themselves, as the angels do. But the human being loves only himself and the world, and hates his neighbour, except so far as he - his neighbour - indulges him, 
letting him take control and giving him the world. Since therefore the way people live is totally contrary to heavenly order the Lord rules them by means of separate spirits and angels for each one.  </p>

Res ita se habet: a Domino per mundum spiritualem in subjecta mundi naturalis est influxus communis et est influxus particularis, influxus communis in illa quae in ordine sunt, influxus particularis 
in illa quae non in ordine sunt; animalia cujuscumque generis in ordine suae naturae sunt, idcirco in illa est influxus communis; quod in ordine suae naturae sint, constat ex eo quod in omnia sua nascantur, 
nec opus habeant ut in illa per aliquam informationem introducantur; at homines non in ordine sunt nec in ulla lege ordinis, idcirco in illos est influxus particularis, hoc est, apud illos sunt 
angeli et spiritus per quos influxus; et nisi illi apud {1}homines forent, ruerent in omne nefas et se praecipitarent momento in profundissimum infernum; homo per spiritus illos et per angelos sub auspicio 
et ductu Domini est. Ordo hominis foret in quem creatus, quod proximum amaret sicut semet, immo plus quam semet, ita faciunt angeli; sed homo se solum amat et mundum, et proximum odit nisi quantum 
ei favet ut imperet et {2} det mundum; ideo quia vita hominis est prorsus contra ordinem caelestem, regitur ille per separatos spiritus et angelos a Domino. @1 hominem$ @2 i ei$ </p>
