<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7879节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7879.</strong>“灾殃必不临到你们身上作灭命的”表来自地狱的诅咒不会进入。这从“灾殃”和“灭命的”的含义清楚可知：“灾殃”在此是指诅咒，因为这个灾殃是埃及一切头生者的死亡，这就是诅咒（参看<a href="7778.htm">7778</a>节）；“灭命的”是指施加诅咒的地狱。对此，即地狱施加诅咒，情况是这样：在来世，恶人的荒凉，以及他们所受的诅咒并被投入地狱并非直接来自陷入邪恶的个体灵人，而是来自地狱。因为来世的邪恶都是通过来自地狱的流注产生的；没有来自那里的流注，没有一个邪恶产生。它们的产生取决于正经历荒凉和诅咒的灵人所处的邪恶状态；而邪恶状态的产生反过来取决于良善和真理的贫乏，或说取决于良善和真理被移除的程度。这种状态决定了他们与地狱的接触量；地狱最乐意或最准备作恶，因为作恶是他们生命最大的快乐。地狱因具有这种性质，故被主关闭。事实上，如果它们被打开，整个人类必灭亡，因为地狱一直渴望摧毁所有人。七万人因大卫数点百姓而被瘟疫灭亡（撒母耳记下24），亚述营中有十八万五千人一夜被杀（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下19.35.htm">19:35</a>）；这一切都是地狱所为，因为那时它们被打开了。如果今日它们被打开，类似的毁灭就会发生；因此，它们被主严严地关着。来自地狱的诅咒无法流入那些被主保守在良善和真理的人中间，这一点由“灾殃必不临到你们身上作灭命的”来表示（参看<a href="7878.htm">7878</a>节）。</p>

And there shall not be in you a plague for a destroyer. That this signifies that damnation from hell shall not flow in, is evident from the signification of "plague," as here being damnation, for this 
plague was the death of all the firstborn in Egypt, and that this denotes damnation, see n. 7778; and from the signification of "a destroyer," as being hell, which inflicts damnation. In regard to this, 
that hell inflicts damnation, the case is this. The devastation of the evil in the other life, and also their damnation, and likewise their being cast down into hell, does not come immediately from 
the spirit who is in evil, but from the hells. For the evils which are there all arise through an influx from the hells, and none without influx thence, and they arise according to the state of evil 
in which the spirits are who are being vastated and damned; and the state of evil arises in accordance with the privation of good and truth. In accordance with this state is effected communication with 
the hells; and the hells are most ready to inflict evil, for to inflict evil is the very delight of their life. Being of this character, the hells are kept shut by the Lord; for if they were opened, 
the whole human race would perish, because the hells continually breathe the destruction of all. That seventy thousand men perished by the pestilence on account of the numbering of the people by David 
(2 Sam. 24) and that a hundred and eighty and five thousand were slain in one night in the camp of the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:35) was wrought by the hells, because they were then opened. Similar effects 
would be produced at this day if they were to be opened; and therefore they are kept closely shut by the Lord. (That damnation from the hells cannot flow in with those who are kept by the Lord in 
good and truth, and that this is signified by "there shall not be in you a plague for a destroyer," see just above, n. 7878.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7879</b></p><p><b>7879.</b>
'And the plague will not be on you for the destroyer' means that damnation from hell will not enter in. This is clear from the meaning here of 'the plague' as damnation, for this plague is the death 
of all the firstborn in Egypt, which is damnation, see <a href="7778.htm">7778</a>; and from the meaning of 'the destroyer' as hell which inflicts damnation. The implications of this, that hell inflicts damnation, are as follows: 
The vastation that the evil undergo in the next life, also their damnation, and their being cast into hell too, is not brought about directly by the individual spirit immersed in evil but by the 
hells. For the evils that arise there all come about as a result of influx from the hells; none does so without that influx from there. Their rise also depends on the state of evil in which the spirits 
undergoing vastation and damnation are caught up; and that state of evil depends in turn on the degree to which goodness and truth have been removed. This state determines the amount of contact they 
have with the hells; and the hells are very ready to inflict ill, for inflicting ill is the greatest delight of their life. Since the hells are like this the Lord keeps them shut. Indeed if they were 
to be opened the whole human race would be destroyed; for the hells constantly long for the destruction of all. The destruction by pestilence of seventy thousand men, because of David's numbering of 
the people, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Samuel <a href="24.htm">24</a>, and the killing in the camp of the Assyrians of a hundred and eighty-five thousand in one night, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 19:35, were done by the hells at times when they had been opened. Similar 
destruction would take place at the present day if they were opened; they are therefore kept strictly closed by the Lord. With regard to damnation from the hells being unable to enter in among those 
maintained by the Lord in goodness and truth, meant by 'the plague will not be on you for the destroyer', see immediately above in <a href="7878.htm">7878</a>. </p>

</p><b>7879.</b>
`Et non erit in vobis plaga perditori': quod significet quod damnatio ab inferno non influet, constat ex significatione `plagae' quod hic sit damnatio, nam haec plaga erat {1} mors omnium primogenitorum 
in Aegypto, quae quod sit damnatio, videatur n. 7778; et ex significatione `perditoris' quod sit infernum quod damnationem infert. Cum hoc, quod infernum damnationem inferat, ita se habet: devastatio 
malorum in altera vita, tum quoque damnatio, {2}ut et dejectio in infernum, non venit immediate a spiritu qui in malo est, sed venit {3} ab infernis; mala enim quae ibi {4} omnia existunt per influxum 
ab infernis, et nullum absque influxu inde, et existunt secundum statum mali in quo {5}sunt spiritus qui vastantur (c)et damnantur; et status mali existit secundum privationem {6}boni et veri; secundum 
(c)eum statum fit communicatio cum infernis; et inferna paratissima sunt {7}ad inferendum malum, nam {8}inferre malum est ipsum jucundum vitae illorum {9}.  Quia inferna talia sunt, idcirco a 
Domino clausa tenentur; {10}quippe si aperirentur, periret universum genus humanum, nam inferna perniciem omnium continue spirant; quod peste perierint septuaginta milia virorum, propter numerationem 
populi a Davide, 2 Sam. xxiv; quodque in castris Assyriorum occisa sint centum octoginta et quinque milia in una nocte, 2 Reg. xix 35, facta sunt (c)ab infernis, quod tunc aperta {11}fuerint; similiter 
foret hodie si aperirentur; idcirco a Domino stricte occlusa tenentur.  Quod damnatio ab infernis non influere possit apud illos qui a Domino in bono et vero tenentur, quod significatur per quod `non 
erit in vobis plaga perditori,' videatur mox supra n. 7878. 	@1 i etiam$ 	@2 ut ut praecipitatio (ut et praecipitatio probably intended)$ 	@3 i mediate$ 	@4 i contingunt$ 	@5 After damnantur$ 	@6
