<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10431</strong>.“让我的怒气向他们发热，将他们灭绝”表他们如此远离内在事物，因而远离神性事物，以致他们必然灭亡。这从“怒气发热”和“灭绝”的含义清楚可知：“怒气发热”当论及耶和华时，是指人这一方的远离，如下文所述；“灭绝”当论及耶和华时，是指由于他们自己的邪恶而灭亡。圣言的许多经文论到耶和华说，祂怒火中烧、发热，以及祂灭绝、毁灭。但经上如此之说是因为，当一个人背离主时，如他作恶时的情形，在那人看来似乎是主如此行。那时他因不蒙垂听，甚至还受到惩罚，故以为主向他充满怒气；而事实上，主从不发怒，从不灭绝，因为祂是怜悯本身和良善本身。这表明字面上的圣言是何性质，即：它是照着人所看到的表象来说的。下文也有这样一个表象，那里说耶和华后悔；而事实上，耶和华从不后悔，因为祂自永恒就预见一切。由此可见那些阅读圣言时只思想字义，因而不借助取自圣言、向他们指明真相的教义而阅读圣言的人会犯多少错误。因为那些借助这类教义阅读圣言的人都知道耶和华是怜悯本身和良善本身，因怒气发热并灭绝这样的话绝无可能论及无限怜悯和无限良善。所以他们从这些教义知道并明白，当这种话出现时，它是照着人所看到的表象来说的。怒气和邪恶来源于人，而非来源于主，但它们仍被归于主（参看<a href="9306.htm">9306</a>节提到的地方）；怒气当论及主时，表示人背离主（<a href="5034.htm">5034</a>，<a href="5798.htm">5798</a>，<a href="8483.htm">8483</a>，<a href="8875.htm">8875</a>节）。</p>

That Mine anger may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them. That this signifies that in so doing they turn themselves away from internal things, thus from things Divine, so that they must 
needs perish, is evident from the signification of "anger waxing hot," when said of Jehovah, as being a turning away on the part of man (of which below), and from the signification of "consuming," when 
also said of Jehovah, as being to perish in consequence of their own evil. In many passages of the Word it is said of Jehovah that He burns with anger and is wroth, and also that He consumes and destroys. 
But it is so said because it so appears to the man who turns himself away from the Lord, as is the case when he does evil; and as then he is not heard, and is even punished, he believes that the 
Lord is in anger against him; although the Lord is never angry, and never consumes, for He is mercy itself and good itself. From this it is evident what is the nature of the Word as to the letter, namely, 
that it is according to the appearance with man. In like manner it is said that "Jehovah repents," as in what follows, when yet Jehovah never repents, for He foresees all things from eternity; 
from which it can be seen into how many errors those fall who when reading the Word do not think beyond the sense of the letter, thus who read it without doctrine from the Word to teach them how the case 
really is. For they who read the Word in accordance with doctrine know that Jehovah is mercy itself and good itself, and that it cannot possibly be said of infinite mercy and infinite good that it 
burns with anger and consumes. Wherefore from this doctrine they know and see that it is so said according to the appearance presented to man. (That anger and evil are from man, and not from the Lord, 
and that nevertheless they are attributed to the Lord, see at the places cited in n. 9306; and that "anger," when said of the Lord, denotes man's turning away from the Lord, n. 5034, 5798, 8483, 8875.) </p>

'And let My anger grow hot against them, and let Me consume them' means that they turn themselves so far away from inward and thus Divine things that they are inevitably destroyed. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'growing hot with anger', when it has reference to Jehovah, as a turning away on man's part, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'consuming', when this too has reference to Jehovah, 
as being destroyed by their own evil. Many places in the Word speak of Jehovah's becoming inflamed with anger and growing hot, and also of His consuming and destroying. But the reason why they do 
so is that when a person turns himself away from the Lord, as happens when he does what is evil, it appears to that person as though He acts in those ways. And since he is not heard then and is also punished 
the person supposes that the Lord is full of anger towards him, when in fact the Lord is never angry and never consumes; for He is Mercy itself and Goodness itself. This shows the true nature 
of literal statements in the Word, namely that they are made in accord with the appearance as seen by man. One such appearance occurs in what follows, where Jehovah is said to repent; but in reality He 
never repents, for everything is foreseen from eternity by Him. From this also it may be recognized how many errors those people fall into who think of nothing beyond the literal sense when they read 
the Word, thus who read it without the aid of teachings drawn from the Word which show them what the real truth is. For those who read the Word with the aid of such teachings know that Jehovah is Mercy 
itself and Goodness itself, and that it cannot by any means at all be said of infinite Mercy nor of infinite Goodness that it grows hot with anger and consumes. From those teachings therefore they 
know and see that when such a statement occurs it is made in accord with the appearance as seen by man.  </p>
<p>Anger and evil have their origin in man and not in the Lord, but they are nevertheless attributed 
to the Lord, see in the places referred to in <a href="9306.htm">9306</a>.  Anger when spoken of in regard to the Lord means a person's turning away from the Lord, <a href="5034.htm">5034</a>, <a href="5798.htm">5798</a>, <a href="8483.htm">8483</a>, <a href="8875.htm">8875</a>.  </p>

`Et exardescat ira Mea in illos, et consumam illos': quod significet quod sic se avertant ab internis, ita a Divinis, ut non possint non perire, constat (c)ex significatione `exardescere ira' cum de 
Jehovah, quod sit aversio apud hominem, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `consumere' cum etiam de Jehovah, quod sit perire ex suo malo. In Verbo multis in locis dicitur {1}de Jehovah quod ardescat 
Ira, et excandescat, et quoque quod consumat et destruat; sed ita dicitur {2} quoniam ita apparet homini qui avertit se a Domino, quod fit cum malum facit; et quia tunc non auditur et quoque punitur, 
credit quod Dominus in ira sit contra illum, cum tamen Dominus nusquam irascitur, {3}et nusquam consumit, est enim ipsa Misericordia, {4}ac ipsum Bonum; inde patet quale est Verbum quoad litteram, 
quod nempe sit secundum apparentiam apud hominem; similiter quod dicatur quod Jehovam paeniteat, ut in sequentibus, cum tamen Jehovam nusquam paenitet, praevidet enim omnia ab aeterno; inde quoque constare 
potest in quot errores labuntur illi qui non ultra sensum litterae {5}cogitant cum legunt Verbum, {6}ita' qui id legunt absque doctrina e Verbo quae doceat quomodo se res habet; qui enim ex doctrina 
legunt Verbum sciunt quod Jehovah sit ipsa Misericordia, (c)ac ipsum Bonum, et quod nequaquam dici possit de infinita Misericordia (c)et de influito Bono, quod exardescat ira et consumat; quapropter 
ex doctrina illa sciunt et vident quod secundum apparentiam {7}coram homine ita dicatur. Quod ira et malum sint ab homine et non a Domino, et quod usque (x)tribuantur Domino, videatur in locis citatis
