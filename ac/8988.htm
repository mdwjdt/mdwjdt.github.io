<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8988节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8988.</strong>“那么他的主人就要带他到神那里”表那时他照神性秩序所进入的一种状态。这从“带到神那里”的含义清楚可知。当论述的主题是那些充满真理，不能充满良善的人时，“带到神那里”是指使他们进入一种符合神性秩序的状态；因为“带到”表示进入，“神”表示神性秩序，如下文所述。所表示的是这些事，这一点从包含在本节其余经文中的细节明显看出来。这些细节描述了那些充满真理，却未充满相应的良善之人的状态，也就是说，这是一种永远服从的状态。相对于那些充满与真理相对应的良善之人，处于这种状态的人就是处于奴役的状态。因为前者出于良善行事，故出于情感行事；出于情感行事的人就是出于意愿，因而出于自己行事，因为凡属于人之意愿的，都是他自己的，或说凡形成人之意愿的一部分的，都是其真正自我的一部分；事实上，人之生命的本质或存在就是他的意愿。但那些只出于服从行事的人并非出于他们的意愿行事，而是出于他们主人的意愿行事，因而不是出于他们自己，而是出于别人行事；因此，相对来说，他们处于奴役的状态。出于真理，而不出于良善行事，就是唯独出于理解力行事；因为真理与理解力有关，良善与意愿有关；出于理解力，而不出于意愿行事就是出于站在外面服事的东西行事，因为理解力已经被赋予人，好叫他能接受真理，并把真理引入意愿，以便它们能变成良善；事实上，当真理变成意愿的一部分时，它们就被称为良善。<br />然而，通过遵行主的诫命，因而通过服从主而事奉主不是成为奴仆，而是成为一个自由的人，因为人的完美或绝对自由在于被主引领（<a href="892.htm">892</a>，<a href="905.htm">905</a>，<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>，<a href="2872.htm">2872</a>节）。主将他的行为所源于良善注入这个人的意愿；尽管这良善来自主，但此人仍有这种感觉：他的行为来自他自己，也就是说，他在自由中行出它们。所有住在主里面的人都拥有这种自由，并且这自由还伴随着无法形容的幸福。<br />“神”在此之所以表示神性秩序，是因为在圣言中，在论述真理的地方，经上都会用“神”这个名，在论述良善的地方，经上则用“耶和华”这个名（<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>e，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7268.htm">7268</a>，<a href="8867.htm">8867</a>节）。因此，就至高意义而言，从主的神性良善发出的神性真理就是“神”（God），发出神性真理的的神性良善则是“耶和华”。原因在于，神性良善是存在本身或本质的存在，神性真理是来自它的显现；事实上，从某种事物发出的东西也从这个事物显现。天上或天使中间，以及教会里世人中间的良善与真理情形也一样。那里的良善是存在本身或本质的存在，真理则是来自它的显现。或也可说，对主之爱和对邻之爱是天堂和教会的本质存在，而信则是来自它的显现。这一切清楚表明为何“神”也能表示神性秩序，因为正是从主发出的神性真理构成了天上的秩序，并且如此完全地构成，以致神性真理就是秩序本身。神性真理就是秩序（参看<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="7995.htm">7995</a>，<a href="8700.htm">8700</a>节）。所以当一个人或一位天使接受良善里面来自主的神性真理时，就有天上的秩序与他同在。因此，他就是主的一个具体的天堂或国度；他照着充满来自真理的良善的程度，之后照着被赋予来自良善的真理程度而成为这样的天堂或国度。并且（何等的一个奥秘）天使本身以人的形式出现在天堂，这种形式与在良善里面同他们在一起的真理，以及与符合来自真理的良善品质的美丽和光辉完全一致。教会成员的灵魂在天上就呈现出类似的形像。从主发出的神性真理本身带来了这一切，这从前面许多章节末尾关于如同大人的天堂，以及它与人里面一切事物的对应关系的说明可以看出来。<br />这个奥秘就是约翰在启示录中的这些话所表示的：<br />他量了圣耶路撒冷的城墙，按着人，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>）<br />若不知道“圣耶路撒冷”、它的“城墙”、尺寸、144这个数字、因而“人”，也就是“天使”表示什么，谁能明白这些话？“新的圣耶路撒冷”表示主的新教会，这个新教会即将取代如今存在的基督教会（<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>节）；“城墙”表示将要保护该教会的信之真理（<a href="6419.htm">6419</a>节）；“量”和“尺寸”表示它在真理方面的状态（<a href="3104.htm">3104</a>节）；144这个数字与12所表相同，因为144是12与12的乘积，这些数字表示整体上的一切真理（参看<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）。这些含义清楚表明“按着人，就是天使的尺寸”表示什么，即：以自己的形式从主发出的真理本身，这真理是天上的天使人（man-angel或angel man）的形式，如前所述。这一切揭示了包含在上面那些话中的奥秘，即：它们描述了将要取代如今存在的基督教会的新教会之真理<br />下一节则以这些话描述了它们是来自良善的真理：<br />墙的构造是碧玉的，城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.18.htm">21:18</a>）<br />“碧玉”表示诸如将成为新教会真理的那种真理，因为“石头”一般表示真理（<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节），“宝石”则表示来自主的真理（<a href="643.htm">643</a>节）；“金”表示爱与智慧的良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）。谁能预知这些话竟包含这样的含义？谁不能由此看出有无数奥秘藏在圣言中？这些奥秘若不凭借内义，绝不会显明给任何人；内义如同一把钥匙，是打开诸如存在于天上的那种神之真理，因而打开天堂和主自己的手段，而主自己在至内在意义上则是圣言全部中的全部。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8988</b></p><p><b>8988.</b>
Then his master shall bring him unto God. That this signifies a state into which he then enters according to Divine order, is evident from the signification of "bringing unto God," when those are treated 
of who are in truths and cannot be in good, as being to cause them to enter into a state according to Divine order; for by "bringing unto" is signified to enter; and by "God" is signified Divine 
order (of which in what follows). That these things are signified is plain from what follows in this verse, in which is described the state of those who are in truths and not in the corresponding good, 
namely, that it is a state of perpetual obedience. For they who are in this state are in servitude relatively to those who are in good that corresponds with truths; because as these latter act from 
good, they act from affection; and they who act from affection, act from the will, thus of themselves; for whatsoever is of the will with man is his own, seeing that the being of man's life is his will. 
But they who act merely from obedience do not act from their will, but from the will of their master; thus not from themselves, but from another; and therefore they are relatively in servitude. To 
act from truths, and not from good, is to act solely from the intellectual part; for truths bear relation to the intellectual part, and goods to the will part; and to act from the intellectual part, and 
not from the will part, is to act from that which stands without and serves, because the understanding has been given to man to receive truths, and to introduce them into the will, that they may become 
goods; for truths are called goods when they become of the will. [2] But to serve the Lord, by doing according to His commandments, and thus by obeying Him, is not to be a servant, but is to be 
free, for the veriest freedom of man consists in being led of the Lord (n. 892, 905, 2870, 2872), because the Lord inspires into the very will of man the good from which he is to act, and though it is 
from the Lord, still it is perceived as if it were from self, thus from freedom. This freedom is possessed by all who are in the Lord, and it is conjoined with inexpressible happiness. [3] The term 
"God" here denotes Divine order, because in the Word "God" is named where truth is treated of, and "Jehovah" where good is treated of (n. 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4402, 7010, 7268, 8867); and therefore 
in the supreme sense the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of the Lord is "God," and His Divine good from which the Divine truth proceeds is "Jehovah." The reason is that the Divine good is 
Being itself, and the Divine truth is the derivative Coming-forth; for that which proceeds comes forth by so doing. The case is similar with good and truth in heaven, or with the angels, and also in 
the church with men. The good there is being itself, and the truth is the derivative coming-forth; or what is the same, love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor are the very being of heaven and 
of the church, but faith is the derivative coming-forth. From this it is clear whence it is that "God" denotes also Divine order, for it is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord which makes order 
in heaven, insomuch that Divine truth is order itself. (That Divine truth is order, see n. 1728, 1919, 7995, 8700.) And therefore when a man or an angel receives Divine truth from the Lord in good, there 
is with him the order which is in the heavens, consequently he is a heaven or kingdom of the Lord in particular; and this in the degree in which he is in good from truths, and afterward in the degree 
in which he is in truths from good; and-what is a secret-the angels themselves appear in a human form in the heavens absolutely according to the truths which pertain to them in good, with a beauty 
and brightness according to the quality of the good from truths. As to their souls so also do the men of the church appear in heaven. It is the Divine truth itself proceeding from the Lord that leads 
to this, as can be seen from what has been shown about heaven as the Grand Man, and about its correspondence with everything in man, at the end of many chapters. [4] This secret is what is meant by 
these words of John in Revelation: </p>
<p>     He measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem, a hundred and forty and four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:17). Who can possibly 
understand these words that does not know what is signified by "the holy Jerusalem;" what by "the wall" thereof; what by a "measure;" what by "the number one hundred and forty and four;" and thus 
what by "a man, that is, an angel?" By "the new and holy Jerusalem" is signified the New Church of the Lord which is at this day about to succeed the Christian Church (n. 2117); by "the wall" are signified 
the truths of faith which will defend that church (n. 6419); by "measuring" and "the measure" is signified its state as to truth (n. 3104); by the number "one hundred and forty and four" is signified 
the like as by "twelve," for one hundred and forty-four is a number compounded of twelve multiplied into twelve. (That by these numbers are signified all truths in the complex, see n. 7973). From 
this it is clear what is signified by "the measure of a man, that is, of an angel," namely, truth itself proceeding from the Lord in its own form, which as before said is the form of an angel man 
in heaven. All this makes clear the secret involved in the above words, namely, that by them are described the truths of that Church which is to succeed the Christian Church existing at this day. [5] 
That these are truths from good is described in the next following verse in these words: </p>
<p>     The building of the wall thereof was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like to pure glass (Rev. 21:18). By 
"jasper" is signified truth such as will be the truth of that church, for by stones in general are signified truths (n. 1298, 3720, 6426), and by "precious stones," truths which are from the Lord 
(n. 643); by "gold" is signified the good of love and of wisdom (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658). Who could ever foresee that such things are involved in the above words? and who cannot see from this that 
innumerable arcana lie hidden in the Word, which in no wise appear to anyone except through the internal sense? and that by this sense, as by a key, are opened truths Divine such as are in heaven, consequently 
heaven and the Lord Himself, who, in the inmost sense, is the all in all of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8988</b></p><p><b>8988.</b>
'[His] master shall bring him to God' means the state he then enters in keeping with Divine order. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing to God', when the subject is those who are imbued with truths 
and cannot be imbued with good, as causing them to enter a state in keeping with Divine order; for 'bringing to' means entering, and 'God' means Divine order, which is dealt with below. The fact 
that these things are meant is evident from the details contained in the rest of this verse. These describe the state of those imbued with truths and not with complementary good, that is to say, a state 
of everlasting obedience. For those living in this condition are in servitude compared with those imbued with good complementing truths. For being governed by good the latter's actions spring from 
affection; and those who act from affection do so from the will, thus from themselves since whatever forms part of a person's will is part of his true self; for indeed the essence (esse) of a person's 
life is his will. But those whose actions spring from obedience act not from their own will, but from their master's, thus not from themselves, but from another; therefore in comparison they are in 
servitude. Actions that spring from truths and not from good spring solely from the understanding, for truths have connection with the understanding and forms of good with the will; and actions that spring 
from the understanding and not from the will spring from that which stands outside and serves. The understanding has been given to a person in order that he may receive truths and introduce them 
into his will to become forms of good; for when truths become part of the will they are called forms of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The condition however of one who serves the Lord by doing according to His commandments, 
and by being obedient in that kind of way, is not that of a slave; rather, it is that of one who is free. For perfect freedom consists for a person in being led by the Lord, <a href="892.htm">892</a>, <a href="905.htm">905</a>, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>, <a href="2872.htm">2872</a>. 
The Lord breathes the good into the person's will from which his actions spring; and although that good comes from the Lord, the person nevertheless has the feeling that his actions are from himself, 
that is, he does them in freedom. This freedom exists with all who abide in the Lord; and coupled with it there is indescribable happiness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why 'God' here means Divine order is that 
in the Word the name 'God' is used where truth is referred to, and 'Jehovah' where good is referred to, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2822.htm">2822</a>, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a> (end), <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7268.htm">7268</a>, <a href="8867.htm">8867</a>. Therefore Divine Truth emanating from the 
Lord's Divine Good is meant in the highest sense by 'God', and His Divine Good from which Divine Truth emanates is meant by 'Jehovah'. The reason for this is that Divine Good is Essential Being (Esse), 
and Divine Truth is the Coming-into- Being (Existere) from it, since what emanates from something comes into being from it. The situation with good and truth in heaven or among angels is similar, 
and that in the Church among men is similar. Good there is the essential being, and truth is the coming-into-being from it. Or what amounts to the same thing love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour 
is the essential being of heaven and the Church, while faith is the coming-into-being from it. All this makes plain why it is that 'God' can also mean Divine order; for Divine Truth emanating from 
the Lord is what constitutes order in heaven, so completely that it is order itself. For more about Divine Truth's being order, see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="7995.htm">7995</a>, <a href="8700.htm">8700</a>. </p>
<p>Therefore when man or angel receives 
Divine Truth from the Lord within good, there resides with him that order which exists in the heavens. As a consequence he is a heaven or kingdom of the Lord in particular; he is such in the measure that 
he is imbued with good from truths, and after this in the measure that he is endowed with truths from good. And - what is an arcanum - angels themselves appear in heaven in a human form that accords 
exactly with the truths present with them within good, together with beauty and brilliance which accord with the character of the good from truths. The souls of members of the Church present a similar 
appearance in heaven. The Divine Truth itself emanating from the Lord brings this about, as may be recognized from what has been shown at the ends of a number of chapters regarding heaven as the Grand 
Man, and its correspondence with individual aspects of a human being. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This arcanum is what the following words are used to mean in John, in the Book of Revelation, </p>
<blockquote>
He measured the wall 
of the holy Jerusalem, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man (homo), that is, of an angel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Will anyone ever understand these words if he does not know what the 
holy Jerusalem, its wall, measure, the number <a href="144.htm">144</a>, and so 'a man, that is, an angel' all mean? By the new or holy Jerusalem is meant the Lord's New Church, which is going to take the place of the Christian 
Church existing at the present time, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>; by 'the wall' is meant the truths of faith which will defend that Church, <a href="6419.htm">6419</a>; by 'measuring' and 'the measure' is meant its state in respect of truth, <a href="3104.htm">3104</a>; by the number <a href="144.htm">144</a> is meant much the same as by <a href="12.htm">12</a>, since <a href="144.htm">144</a> is the number that is the product of <a href="12.htm">12</a> multiplied by itself, and by these numbers all truths in their entirety are meant, see <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>. 
These meanings make plain what is meant by 'the measure of a man, that is, of an angel', namely actual truth emanating from the Lord in the form it assumes, which is that of a man-angel in heaven, as 
stated above. All this reveals the arcanum which the words quoted above embody; it reveals that they describe the truths of that Church which is going to take the place of the Christian Church existing 
at the present time. </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The fact that they are truths from good is described in the very next verse, in these words, </p>
<blockquote>
The construction of its wall was jasper, but the city was pure gold, like pure 
glass. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Jasper' means truth such as that Church's will be, for truths are meant by 'stones' generally, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, and truths that come from the Lord by 'precious stones', <a href="643.htm">643</a>; 
and 'gold' means the good of love and wisdom, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>. Would anyone ever discern that such meanings are embodied in those words? Yet who can fail to see from them that countless arcana 
lie concealed in the Word, which are not at all made apparent to anyone except by means of the internal sense, and that this sense, like a key, is the means of opening up God's truths as they exist in 
heaven, and therefore heaven and the Lord Himself, who is the All in all of the Word in its inmost sense? </p>
