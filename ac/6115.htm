<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6115节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6115.</strong>“约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里”表记忆知识都被带入与属世层里面的总体之物的联系之中。这从“带到”的含义、“银子”和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“带到”是指带入联系之中并引入；“银子”是指含有真理在里面并适合的记忆知识（参看<a href="6112.htm">6112</a>节）；“法老”是指总体的属世层（参看<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>，<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>，<a href="6015.htm">6015</a>节），故“法老的宫”是指属世层里面的总体之物，因为它包括那里整体上的一切事物。<br />至于含有真理在里面并适合的记忆知识被带入与总体之物的联系之中，要知道，一切记忆知识，以及一切真理若要成为某种事物，都必须无一例外地被带入一个总整体的联系之中，必须被置于并包含在这个总的整体中，并服从于它，否则，它们立刻消散，随风而逝。事实上，记忆知识和真理若要成为某种事物，就必须被带入它们在其中彼此互相关联的一个形式中；这一切无法成就，除非它们在一个总的整体之下彼此关联。因此，这就是那将它们保持在形式中并使得其中的每个记忆知识或真理拥有自己品质的东西。这总的整体本身，连同其它类似总的整体，也必须被带入更为总体之物之下的彼此关联中；而这些更为总体之物则必须反过来在最为总体之物之下；否则，总体之物，甚至更为总体之物都必消散，随风而逝。<br />万物保持联结所凭借的最为总体且包罗万象的整体就是主自己，那将万物联结在一起的是从主发出的神性真理。更为总体之物是灵界的总体社群，神性真理在一个总体层面上流入这些社群，并将它们彼此区分开来。总体之物是在每一个更为总体之物之下的不怎么总体的社群。更为总体的社群是对应于人的肢体、器官和内脏的社群；它们以一种神奇的方式被联结在一起，并存在于这样一个形式中：它们互相关注彼此，从而互相将彼此联结在一起，以及将它们自己呈现为一个单一整体。在人里面，将每一个事物联结起来的这最为总体且包罗万象的整体就是灵魂；它也是从主发出的神性真理，因为神性真理不断流入灵魂，并使它成为它所是的样子。<br />从主发出的神性真理就是那被称为道或圣言的，“万物都是藉着道或圣言造的”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>），或说万物都是通过道或圣言存在，因而也通过道或圣言持续存在。凡愿意注意自然界的事物之人都会清楚发现这一真理：整个自然界的一切事物都在一个总的整体之下，每一个具体事物则在它自己的总的整体之下，否则，它们无法持续存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6115</b></p><p><b>6115.</b>
And Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house. That this signifies that it was all brought into relation to what is general in the natural, is evident from the signification of "bringing into," 
as being to bring into relation and to introduce; from the signification of "silver," as being true and adaptable memory-knowledge (see n. 6112); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural 
in general (see n. 5160, 5799, 6015); thus the "house of Pharaoh" is what is general in the natural, because it is everything therein in the complex. [2] In regard to true and adaptable memory-knowledges 
being brought into relation to what is general, be it known that in order to be anything, all memory-knowledges and also all truths whatsoever, must be brought into relation to their generals, 
and must be placed and contained in and under a general, as otherwise they are at once dissipated. For in order that memory-knowledges and truths may be anything, they must be brought into a form 
in which they shall mutually regard each other, which cannot be effected unless they are consociated under a general; and therefore it is this general which holds them together in form, and causes that 
each constituent therein may have its own quality. The general itself, together with other generals, must also be brought into relation under things more general; and the more general things again, 
under the most general; for otherwise the general things, and likewise the more general things, would be dissipated. [3] The most general universal, by virtue of which all things are held together, 
is the Lord Himself, and that which holds together is the Divine truth proceeding from Him. The more general things are the general societies in the spiritual world, into which the Divine truth flows 
and distinguishes them in kind from one another. The general things are the societies less general under each more general society. The more general societies are those to which the members, organs, and 
viscera in man correspond, which by a wonderful connection are in such a form that they mutually regard each other, and thus mutually hold each other together, and also present themselves as a one. 
In man, the most general universal, which holds the single things together, is the soul; thus also it is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, for this is continually flowing in and causing the 
soul to be such as it is. [4] The Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is what is called the "Word through which all things were created" (John 1:1-3), or through which all things have come into existence, 
consequently through which all things subsist. That all things in the universal natural world are under a general, and each thing under its own general; and that otherwise they cannot subsist, 
will be plainly discerned by him who is willing to pay attention to the things in nature. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6115</b></p><p><b>6115.</b>
'And Joseph caused the silver to come to Pharaoh's house' means that all that factual knowledge was brought into association with the general whole within the natural. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'causing to come' as bringing into association with and introducing into; from the meaning of 'silver' as factual knowledge that holds truth in it and is appropriate, dealt with in <a href="6112.htm">6112</a>; and from the 
representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural in general, dealt with in <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>, <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>, <a href="6015.htm">6015</a>, and therefore 'Pharaoh's house' is the general whole within the natural since this includes everything there in 
its entirety. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Regarding this matter of bringing known facts that hold truths in them and that are appropriate into association with a general whole, it should be recognized that all known facts, 
and truths as well, if they are to be anything, must without exception be brought into association with a general whole. They must be placed with and contained within the general whole and be made 
subject to it; otherwise they are instantly scattered to the winds. Indeed, if known facts and truths are to be anything, they must be brought into a form in which they have a mutual relationship with 
one another, and this cannot be done if they do not exist in association with one another subject to a general whole. This therefore is what preserves them in the form they receive and gives each fact 
or truth there its specific character. That general whole too, together with others like it, must be brought into association with one another subject to a more general whole, and these in turn must 
be subject to the most general of all. If they are not, even the general wholes, and the more general ones too, are scattered to the winds. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The most general and all-embracing whole, the source 
from which everything is held in place, is the Lord Himself; and what holds everything in place is Divine Truth going forth from Him. The more general wholes are general communities in the spiritual 
world into which Divine Truth flows, which makes them distinct and separate from one another on a general level; and the general wholes are less general communities subject to a more general one. The 
more general communities are those to which the members, organs, and viscera in a person correspond; through the amazing way that they are linked together they exist in a kind of form in which they have 
regard to one another and thus hold one another in place, and also present themselves as a single whole. In the human being the most general and all-embracing whole, holding every single thing in 
place, is the soul. It is also Divine Truth going forth from the Lord, for Divine Truth flows constantly into the soul and makes it what it is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Divine Truth going forth from the Lord is what is 
called the Word, through which all things were created, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3</a>, that is, through which all things came into being, and therefore through which all things are kept in being. The truth that all things 
in the entire natural world exist subject to a general whole, each specific thing to its own general whole, and that otherwise they cannot remain in being, anyone will plainly discover who is willing 
to turn his attention to those things in the natural creation. </p>

`Et venire fecit Joseph argentum domum Pharaonis':quod significet quod illud omne referretur ad commune in naturali, constat a significatione `venire facere' quod sit referre ad ac introducere; a significatione 
`argenti' quod sit scientificum verum et aptabile, de qua n. 6112, et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale in communi, de qua n. (x)5160, 5799, 6015, inde `domus Pharaonis' est 
commune in naturali, quia est omne ibi in complexu.  [2] De his quod scientifica vera et aptabilia referantur ad commune, sciendum quod omnia scientifica ut et vera, quaecumque sunt, ut sint aliquid, 
referenda sint ad commune ac ponenda et continenda in communi et sub communi; nisi ita, dissipantur ilico; quippe, ut scientifica et vera sint aliquid, inducenda est illis forma in qua se mutuo spectabunt, 
quod non fieri potest nisi consocientur sub communi; quare commune est quod continet illa in forma, et facit ut unumquodlibet inibi habeat suum quale; ipsum commune etiam referendum est una cum 
communibus aliis sub {1}communioribus, et communiora iterum sub {2}communissimo, alioquin etiam communia, ut et communiora, dissiparentur.  [3] Communissimum universale ex quo omnia continentur, est 
Ipse Dominus, et quod continet est Divinum Verum procedens ab Ipso; communiora sunt societates communes in mundo spirituali in quas influit Divinum Verum, et illas in genere inter se distinguit; communia 
sunt societates minus communes sub unoquovis communiore; societates communiores sunt quibus correspondent membra, organa et viscera in homine, quae per mirabilem connexum in tali forma sunt ut se 
mutuo spectent, ac ita se mutuo contineant, et quoque se sistant ut unum.  In homine communissimum universale quod continet singula, est anima, ita quoque est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, nam hoc 
continue influit et facit ut anima talis sit.  [4] Divinum Verum procedens a Domino est quod vocatur Verbum, per quod omnia creata sunt, Joh. i 1-3, seu per quod omnia exstiterant, proinde per quod 
omnia subsistunt.  Quod omnia in universo mundo naturali sub communi sint, et singula sub suo, et quod aliter subsistere nequeant, reperiet manifeste is qui velit ad illa in natura attendere. </p>
