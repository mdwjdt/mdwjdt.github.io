<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7828节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7828.</strong>“这是你们一年的第一个月”表随后直到永远的所有状态的起点。这从“第一个”、“月”和“年”的含义清楚可知：“第一个”当论及一年中的月份，在内义上论及生命的状态时，是指开始；“月”是指状态，如刚才所述（<a href="7827.htm">7827</a>节）；“年”是指从开始到结束的一段生命时期（<a href="2906.htm">2906</a>节）。此处因谈论的是那些在来世属于属灵教会的人，所以他们的生命时期有一个开始，但没有一个结束，“年”表示从开始持续到永恒的生命时期（“年”所具有这种含义，参看<a href="2906.htm">2906</a>节）。这个月之所以成为“月首”，是第一个，是因为它表示那些属于属灵教会，在此之前因被关在低地而一直处于被囚的状态，在那里遭受法老和埃及人所代表的恶人侵扰之人被释放的开始。当他们得以释放时，其第一个状态之所以是所有状态中的首要状态，也是随后直到永远的所有状态的开始，是因为在那里的人通过主降世而得到释放，因为主若不降世，他们绝无可能得救，还因为他们在主复活之时被释放。由此明显可知，他们被释放之时的状态对他们来说，是所有状态中的首要状态。在此之后，对凡属于属灵教会的人来说，情况都是这样。他们也不可能得救，除非主降世，并荣耀祂的人身，也就是将它变成神性。那些在主降临之前属于属灵教会的人被关在低地，被主释放和拯救（参看<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>节）；总体上那些属于属灵教会的人通过主的降临得救（<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="6372.htm">6372</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>e节）。正因如此，就至高意义而言，这些话表示就主的人身而言，祂的荣耀和复活是一切救恩的源头。</p>

This is the first to you in the months of the year. That this signifies the beginning from which will be all the following states to eternity, is evident from the signification of "to be the first," 
when it is said of the months of the year, and in the internal sense of the states of life, as being the beginning; from the signification of "months," as being states (of which just above, n. 7827); 
and from the signification of "year," as being a period of life from beginning to end (n. 2906). In the present case, because it is said of those who are of the spiritual church in the other life, the 
period of whose life has a beginning but not an end, by "year" is signified a period of life from the beginning to eternity (that "year" has also this signification see n. 2906). This month was made 
the head of months and the first of all, because by it is signified the beginning of the liberation of those who are of the spiritual church, and who up to this time had been in a state of captivity, 
because detained in the lower earth, and there infested by the evil, who are represented by Pharaoh and the Egyptians. That their first state, when they were liberated, was the principal of all and the 
beginning from which would be all the following states to eternity, is because they who were there were liberated by the coming of the Lord into the world, and because without the coming of the Lord 
into the world they could not possibly have been saved, and because they were liberated at the time when the Lord rose again. From this it is evident that the state when they were liberated was to them 
the principal of all states. The case is the same also afterward with all those who are of the spiritual church, who could not possibly have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world, and 
glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine. That they who were of the spiritual church before the coming of the Lord were detained in the lower earth and were liberated and saved by the Lord, see n. 
6854, 6914; and in general, that they who were of the spiritual church have been saved by the Lord's coming, n. 2661, 2716, 6372, 7035, 7091; and therefore in the supreme sense by these words is signified 
that the glorification and resurrection of the Lord as to His Human is the source of all salvation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7828</b></p><p><b>7828.</b>
'The first shall it be for you in the months of the year' means the starting point of all states following for evermore. This is clear from the meaning of 'being the first', when used in reference to 
months of the year and in the internal sense to states of life, as the starting point; from the meaning of 'the months' as states, dealt with immediately above in <a href="7827.htm">7827</a>; and from the meaning of 'the year' 
as the period of life from start to finish, dealt with in <a href="2906.htm">2906</a>. Here, since it is speaking about members of the spiritual Church in the next life, whose period of life has a starting point but no 
finish, 'the year' means the period of life from the start and continuing for evermore (as 'year' can also mean, see end of <a href="2906.htm">2906</a>). The reason why this month became 'the head of months' and the first 
of all is that it means the starting point in the deliverance of those belonging to the spiritual Church who till then were in a state of captivity, since they were held back on the lower earth, where 
they were molested by the evil ones represented by Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The reason why their first state when they were delivered is the chief one of all and why it is the starting point of all 
following for evermore is that those who were there were delivered by the Lord's Coming into the world. They could not possibly have been saved without the Lord's Coming into the world; and their deliverance 
took place when the Lord rose again. From this it is evident that that state - when they were delivered - was for them the chief of all states. It was to be the same after that for all who belonged 
to the spiritual Church. They too could not have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world and glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine. With regard to those who belonged to the spiritual 
Church before the Lord's Coming, that they were held back on the lower earth, and that the Lord delivered and saved them, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>; and in general, that members of the spiritual Church were 
saved by the Lord's Coming, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="1716.htm">1716</a>, <a href="6372.htm">6372</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a> (end). So it is that the words under consideration here mean in the highest sense that the glorification and resurrection of the Lord, of His 
Human, are the source of all salvation. </p>

`Primus hic vobis mensibus anni': quod significet principium a quo status omnes sequentes in aeternum, constat ex significatione `primus esse,' cum de mensibus anni ac in sensu interno de statibus vitae 
dicitur, quod sit principium; ex significatione `mensium' quod sint status, (x)de qua mox supra n. 7827; et (c)ex significatione `anni' quod sit periodus vitae a principio ad finem, de qua n. 2906; 
hic quia de illis dicitur qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in altera vita, quorum periodus vitae principium habet sed non finem, per `annum' significatur periodus vitae a principio in aeternum, quod {1}annus 
etiam id sit, videatur n. 2906 fin.  Quod hic mensis factus sit caput mensium et primus omnium, est quia per illum significatur principium liberationis illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, et qui 
eo usque in statu captivitatis fuerunt, quia detenti in terra inferiore, et ibi infestati a malis qui per `Pharaonem et Aegyptios' repraesentantur; quod status illorum primus cum liberati principalis 
omnium esset, et quod principium a quo omnes {2}sequentes in aeternum, est quia illi qui ibi fuerunt liberati sunt per Adventum Domini in mundum, et quod absque Domini Adventu in mundum nullatenus potuerint 
salvari; et quod tunc liberati sint cum Dominus resurrexit; inde patet quod ille status, nempe cum liberati, fuerit illis principalis omnium statuum; similiter etiam {3}postea omnibus illi qui 
ab Ecclesia spirituali, qui nequaquam salvari {4}potuissent nisi Dominus in mundum venerit ac Humanum Suum glorificaverit, hoc est, Divinum fecerit; quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali ante Adventum 
Domini in terra inferiore fuerint detenti, et quod a Domino liberati et salvati, videatur n. 6854, 6914; et in genere quod qui ab Ecclesia spirituali salvati sint per Adventum Domini, n. 2661, 2716, 6372, 
7035, 7091 fin.; quare in sensu supremo per illa verba significatur quod glorificatio {5}et resurrectio Domini quoad Humanum Suum sit unde omnis salvatio. 	@1 etiam annus sit aeternum$ 	@2 status
