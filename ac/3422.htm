<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3422.</strong>“仍照他父亲给它们起的名字”表真理的有意义的符号。这从以下事实清楚可知：古时，给人、地方和事物所取的名字都具有属灵含义（参看<a href="340.htm">340</a>，<a href="1946.htm">1946</a>，<a href="2643.htm">2643</a>节）；因此，给泉和井所取的名字都是这些泉和井以前所表示之物的有意义的符号；这些事物都与真理有关，如前所示（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3096.htm">3096</a>节）；由于名字具有属灵含义，所以“名字”和“叫名字或称名”一般也表示要么真实事物，要么状态的本质，如刚才所述（<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）；正因如此，在圣言中，就其内义而言，名字都不是指某个人，或某个民族、某个国家、某座城，而总是指某个真实事物。谁都能由此推断出，此处“井”表示属天堂的某种事物，否则，有关井的众多细节就不值得在神性圣言中提及了，因为知道它们根本没用处。如非利士人把亚伯拉罕仆人所挖的井都塞住了；以撒又把它们挖出来，并且照它们以前的名字叫它们的名字；后来，以撒的仆人在山谷中挖了一口井，牧人为这井争竞；后来又挖了一口井，他们还是为这井争竞；于是后来又挖了一口井，他们不再为这井争竞了；再后来又挖了一口井；最后他们告诉以撒挖井的事（26:15，18-22，25，32，33）。不过，现在从内义明显可知，这些井所表示的事物属于天堂。</p>

After the names which his father called them. That this signifies significatives of truth, is evident from the fact that the names which in ancient times were given to persons, places, and things, were 
all significative (n. 340, 1946, 2643); thus the names given to fountains and wells were significative of the things that were formerly understood by fountains and wells, and which had relation to 
truth (as was shown above, n. 2702, 3096); and because names were significative, by "name" also, and by "calling by name" is signified in general the quality of either a thing or a state (as just stated, 
n. 3421); and this being so, by the names in the Word, in its internal sense, is not signified any person, or any nation, or any kingdom, or any city, but always some actual thing. That by "wells" 
in this passage there is signified something heavenly must be obvious to everyone; for unless this were so, to mention so many particulars concerning wells would not be worthy of the Divine Word, because 
it would be of no use to know them; as for instance that the Philistines stopped up the wells which the servants of Abraham digged; that Isaac digged them again, and that he called their names after 
their former names; and afterwards that the servants of Isaac digged a well in the valley about which the shepherds strove; and that they digged again another well about which they also strove; and 
afterwards another about which they did not strive; and again another; and lastly that they told Isaac about a new well (verses 15, 18-22, 25, 32, 33); but the heavenly signification of these wells 
is now manifest from the internal sense. </p>

'Like the names which his father had called them' means meaningful signs of truth. This is clear from the fact that the names which were given in ancient times to persons, places, and things all carried 
spiritual meanings, see <a href="340.htm">340</a>, <a href="1946.htm">1946</a>, <a href="2643.htm">2643</a>. Thus the names given to springs and wells were meaningful signs of the things which springs and wells had been used to mean in former times; and those things 
were matters of truth, as shown in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3096.htm">3096</a>. And because names carried a spiritual meaning, the expressions 'name' and 'calling by name' also mean in general the essential nature either of a real 
thing or of a state, as said immediately above in <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>. That being so, any name used in the Word does not in its internal sense mean some person, or some nation, or some kingdom, or some city, but in 
every case some real thing. Anyone may deduce from this that 'wells' here means something belonging to heaven, for if this were not the case, so many details concerning wells would not have been worth 
mentioning in the Divine Word - since knowledge of them would be no use at all, such as that the Philistines stopped up the wells which Abraham's servants had dug; that Isaac dug them again and called 
them by names like those they had had previously; and that after that Isaac's servants dug a well in the valley, a well over which the herdsmen disputed; and that he dug yet another, which they also 
disputed over; and following that another which they did not dispute over; and yet another; and at length that they gave him an account of the new well, verses 15, 18-22, 25, 32, 33. But the thing belonging 
to heaven that is meant by these is now evident from the internal sense. </p>

`Sicut nomina quae vocavit illis pater ejus': quod significet veri significativa, constat ex eo quod nomina quae antiquis temporibus indebantur personis, locis, rebus, omnia significativa essent, videatur 
n. 340, 1946, 2643, ita quae fontibus et puteis, significativa erant illarum rerum quae per `fontes et puteos' olim intellectae fuerunt, quae quod fuerint veri, n. 2702, 3096 ostensum est; et quia 
nomina fuerunt significativa, etiam per `nomen et vocare nomine' in genere significatur quale vel rei vel status, ut mox supra n. 3421 dictum; et quia ita, per nomina in Verbo, in sensu ejus interno, 
non significatur aliqua persona, aut aliqua gens, aut aliquod regnum, aut aliqua urbs, sed ubique res {1}. Quisque concludere potest quod hic per `puteos' aliquid caeleste significetur, nam nisi hoc, 
tot specifica de puteis memorare non foret dignum Verbo Divino, quia nullius usus scire, ut quod Philistaei obturaverint puteos quos foderunt servi Abrahami; quod Jishak refoderit illos, et quod vocaverit 
illis nomina {2}sicut nomina priora; et dein quod servi Jishaki foderint puteum in valle, de quo rixati pastores; (c)et quod rursus foderint alium, de quo etiam rixati; et postea alium, de quo 
non rixati; ac rursus alium; et tandem quod de novo puteo ei indicaverint, vers. 15, 18-22, 25, 32, 33; at caeleste quod per illos significatur, patet nunc a sensu interno. @1 i ac in supremo sensu,
