<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6720节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6720.</strong>“见他俊美”表对它经由天堂而来的洞察。这从“见”和“俊美”的含义清楚可知：“见”是指一种洞察（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节）；“俊美”在此因论及主里面的神之律法，故是指经由天堂而来。但“俊美”在此表示经由天堂而来，是一个无人能知道的秘密，除非它被揭示出来。当主将祂的人身变成神性时，祂是通过从神性经由天堂的流过而如此行的。天堂凭自己丝毫无助于所流过的东西；但为了神性本身能流入这人身，它经由天堂流入。这种流过就是主降临之前的神性人身，是在众天堂里的耶和华自己，或主。经由天堂已经流入的神性是摩西所代表的神性真理，或神性律法；经由天堂流入的神性是良善。由此可见为何经上她“见他”，即见儿子“俊美”表示对它经由天堂而来的洞察。</p>

And she saw him, that he was good. That this signifies a noticing that it was through heaven, is evident from the signification of "to see," as being a noticing (see n. 2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400); 
and from the signification of "good," here denoting through heaven, because it is said of the law Divine in the Lord. But that "good" here signifies through heaven, is a secret that cannot be known unless 
it is disclosed. When the Lord made His Human Divine, He did this from the Divine, by means of a transflux through heaven-not that heaven contributed anything from itself, but that in order that 
the Divine Itself might flow into the human, it flowed in through heaven. This transflux was the Divine Human before the advent of the Lord, and was Jehovah Himself in the heavens or the Lord. The Divine 
which flowed through heaven was the Divine truth, or the Divine law, which Moses represented; and the Divine which flows through heaven, is good. Hence it is evident whence it is, that by "she saw 
him," namely the son, "that he was good," is signified a noticing that it was through heaven. </p>

'She saw that he was good' means the discernment that it came by way of heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as a discernment, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'good' here, since it is used in reference to the law of God in the Lord, as coming by way of heaven. But as for the meaning here of 'good' as coming by way of heaven, this is an arcanum which 
none can know unless it is brought to light. When the Lord made His Human Divine, He did so by means of a transmission from the Divine through heaven. Heaven contributed nothing of itself to what was 
transmitted; but in order that the Divine itself might flow into the Human it passed through heaven. This transmission was the Divine Human before the Lord's Coming; it was Jehovah Himself in the heavens, 
who was the Lord. The Divine which passed through heaven was Divine Truth or Divine Law, which Moses represented; and the Divine which passes through heaven is good. From this one may see why 
it is that 'she saw that he (her son) was good' means the discernment that it came by way of heaven. </p>

`Vidit illum quod bonus ille': quod significet apperceptionem quod per caelum, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit apperceptio, de qua n. 2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400; et ex significatione `boni' 
quod hic, quia praedicatur de lege Divina in Domino, {1} sit per caelum; sed quod {2}`bonus' hic significet per caelum, est arcanum quod nisi detegatur, (t)non sciri potest; Dominus cum Humanum 
Suum Divinum fecit, ex Divino per transfluxum per caelum hoc fecit; non quod caelum aliquid ex se contribuerit, sed ut Ipsum Divinum influere posset in Humanum, trans caelum influxit; hic transfluxus 
fuit Divinum Humanum ante Domini Adventum, et fuit Ipse Jehovah in caelis seu Dominus; Divinum quod per caelum transfluxit fuit Divinum Verum seu Divina Lex, quam Moses repraesentavit; {3}et Divinum quod 
per caelum transfluit est bonum; inde patet unde est quod per `vidit illum,' nempe filium, `quod bonus ille' significetur apperceptio quod per caelum. 	@1 i quod$ 	@2 bonum$ 	@3 A has nam for et
