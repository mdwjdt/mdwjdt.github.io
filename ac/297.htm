<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第297节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>297.</strong>属天之善是裸露的，因为它是至内之善，天真无邪。属天属灵之善开始需要遮盖，然后是属世之善，因为这些更外在。也因如此，它们被比作衣服，甚至被称作“衣服”。例如：“我使你身穿绣花衣服，脚穿海狗皮鞋，并用细麻布给你束腰，用丝绸为衣披在你身上。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.10.htm">16:10</a>）这是说古教会。<br />又如：“圣城耶路撒冷啊，穿上你华美的衣服。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.1.htm">52:1</a>）<br />再如：“在撒狄你还有几名是未曾污秽自己衣服的，他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">3:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">5</a>）<br />类似地，二十四位长老也说是“身穿白衣”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.4.htm">4:4</a>）。<br />因此，更外在的属天属灵之善和属世之善即是用来遮盖的“衣服”，也因如此，具有仁爱之善的天使显现时，都是身穿光明的衣裳，此处由于尚在肉体中，故被描述为身穿“皮衣”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]297.</strong> Heavenly goodness is unclothed goodness, because it is the deepest good and is innocent. Heavenly good that is spiritual is the first level of good to be clothed, and earthly good is the next, because these two kinds are more external. They are also compared to clothes and are even called clothes. An example occurs in Ezekiel, where the subject is the ancient church:<br />I clothed you with embroidery, gave you shoes of badger, swathed you in fine linen, and covered you in silk. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_297/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_10" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:10</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />Put on your finest clothes, Jerusalem, you holy city. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_297/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_52_1" target=_top>Isaiah 52:1</a>)<br />In the Book of Revelation:<br />... who have not defiled their clothing and will walk with me in white because they are worthy. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_297/bible_king-james-version_revelation_3_4-5" target=_top>Revelation 3:4-5</a>)<br />The same book also mentions the twenty-four elders wearing white garments (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_297/bible_king-james-version_revelation_4_4" target=_top>Revelation 4:4</a>).<br />So the more external kinds of goodness, which are heavenly-spiritual and earthly good, are clothing, and this is why people endowed with the goodness that accompanies charity appear wearing dazzling clothes in heaven. In the current verse, however, because they are still in the body, they wear a leather tunic. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 297</b></p><p><b>297.</b>
Celestial good is not clothed, because it is inmost, and is innocent; but celestial spiritual good is that which is first clothed, and then natural good, for these are more external, and on that account 
are compared to and are called "garments;" as in Ezekiel, speaking of the Ancient Church: </p>
<p>     I clothed thee with broidered work, and shod thee with badger, I girded thee about with fine linen, 
and I covered thee with silk (Ezek. 16:10). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the city of holiness (Isa. 52:1). In Revelation: </p>
<p>     Who have not defiled their garments, and 
they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy (Rev. 3:4-5), where it is likewise said of the four and twenty elders that they were "clothed in white raiment" (4:4). Thus the more external 
goods, which are celestial spiritual, and natural, are "garments;" wherefore also those who are endowed with the goods of charity appear in heaven clothed in shining garments; but here, because still 
in the body, with a "coat of skin." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 297</b></p><p><b>297.</b>
Celestial good is unclothed because it is inmost and is innocent. Good that is celestial-spiritual however is the first to be clothed, and then natural good, for they are more exterior. They are also 
compared to, and actually called, clothing, as in Ezekiel where the Ancient Church is the subject,   I clothed you with embroidered cloth, shed you with badger, swathed you in fine linen, and covered 
you with silk. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:10</a>.   In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
Those who have not soiled their garments will walk with 
Me in white, for they are worthy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:45</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same book the twenty-four elders were 'clad in white garments', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:4</a>. These references show that goods which are more exterior, as are celestial-spiritual 
and natural, are clothing. And this also is why people who are endowed with the goods springing from charity are seen in heaven dressed in magnificent robes. In the present context however, 
because they were still in the body, they had 'coats of skin'.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 297</b>
</p><b>297.</b>
Bonum caeleste est quod non vestitur, quia intimum, et est innocens: at bonum caeleste spirituale est quod primum vestitur, tum bonum naturale; nam exteriora sunt, et vestibus comparantur, ut et vestes 
vocantur; sicut ubi de Antiqua Ecclesia agitur apud Ezechielem, Vestivi te acupicto, calceavi te meli, accinxi te bysso, et obtexi te serico, xvi 10: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Indue vestes ornatus tui, Hierosolyma, 
urbs sanctitatis, lii 1: </p>
<p>in Apocalypsi, Qui non polluerunt vestimenta sua, et ambulabunt mecum in albis, quia digni sunt, iii 4, 5; </p>
<p>et ibi de viginti quatuor senioribus, quod 'induti vestimentis 
albis,' iv 4. Ita bona exteriora, quae sunt caelestia spiritualia et naturalia, sunt 'vestes'; quare etiam qui donati bonis charitatis, apparent in caelo vestibus splendentibus amicti; hic autem, 
quia in corpore adhuc, 'tunica pellis.' </p>
