<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2011节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2011.</strong>“因为我已立你为多族之父”在此和前面一样，表一切真理和由此衍生的良善皆出自祂。这从“父”、“多”和“族”的含义清楚可知：“父”表示他们都来自祂；“多”是指真理；“民族”是指由此衍生的良善（对此，参看<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>-<a href="2007.htm">2007</a>节）。就更普遍、更遥远的意义而言，这些话还表主的人性本质与祂的神性本质的融合（参看<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>节）。因为主的人性本质与神性本质的融合如同真理与良善的融合，其神性本质与人性本质的融合则如同良善与真理的融合，这也是相互的。事实上，在主里面的，正是将自己联结于良善的真理本身，和将自己联结于真理的良善。因为无限的神性只能被称为良善本身和真理本身。所以，人的心智若视主为良善本身和真理本身，就全然无错了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2011</b></p><p><b>2011.</b>
For a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee. That this signifies, here as before, that all truth and the good thence derived come from Him, is evident from the signification of his being 
"a father," as denoting that they are from Him; from the signification of "a multitude," as being truth; and also from that of "nations," as being the good thence derived (concerning which see above, 
n. 2005-2007). That in a more universal or more remote sense these same words signify the union of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence, may be seen above (n. 2004); for the union of the Lord's 
Human Essence with His Divine Essence is circumstanced as is that of truth with good; and the union of His Divine Essence with His Human Essence as is that of good with truth, which is reciprocal. 
Nay, in the Lord it was Truth itself that united itself to Good, and Good that united itself to Truth; for the Infinite Divine can be spoken of in no other way than as being Good itself and Truth itself, 
and therefore the human mind is in no fallacy when it thinks that the Lord is Good itself and Truth itself.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2011</b></p><p><b>2011.</b>
'For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations' means here, as previously, that from Him comes all truth and resulting good. This is clear from the meaning of 'father' as that which comes 
from Him, from the meaning of 'multitude' as truth, and also from the meaning of 'nations' as resulting good, all dealt with above in <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>-<a href="2007.htm">2007</a>. The fact that these same words mean in the more universal 
or more remote sense the union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, see above, in <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>. For the union of the Lord's Human Essence with the Divine Essence is as the union of truth with good, 
and the union of His Divine Essence with the Human Essence that of good with truth - which is reciprocal union. Indeed within the-Lord it was truth itself that united itself to good, and good that united 
itself to truth, for the Infinite Divine cannot be called anything else than Good and Truth themselves. Consequently the human mind is not at all mistaken when it thinks of the Lord as Good itself 
and Truth itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2011</b>
</p><b>2011.</b>
Quod `quia patrem multitudinis gentium dedi te' significet, hic ut prius, quod ab Ipso omne verum et inde bonum, constat a significatione `patris' quod sit ab Ipso; a significatione `multitudinis' quod 
sit verum; tum a `gentium' quod sit inde bonum, de quibus supra n. 2005, 2006, 2007: quod {1} eadem haec verba in sensu universaliore seu remotiore significent Humanae Essentiae unionem cum Divina, 
(o)videatur supra n. 2004; quale habet enim unio Humanae Essentiae Domini cum Divina, sicut veri cum bono, ac unio Divinae Ipsius Essentiae cum Humana, ut boni cum vero, quae reciproca est; immo in 
Domino fuit ipsum verum quod se univit bono, et bonum quod se univit vero, nam Infinitum Divinum non aliter dici potest quam ipsum Bonum et Verum; quare mens humana in nulla fallacia est cum cogitat quod 
Dominus sit ipsum Bonum et ipsum Verum(n). 	@1 i et.$ </p>
