<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5624节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5624.</strong>“并将归还在你们袋口内的银子仍在手里带回去”表他们要通过白白赐予并存在于外层属世层里的真理而使自己尽可能顺服。这从“归还的银子”、“在袋口”和“在手里”的含义清楚可知：“归还的银子”是指白赐予的真理（参看<a href="5530.htm">5530</a>节）；“在袋口”是指在外层属世层的门槛处（参看<a href="5497.htm">5497</a>节）；“在手里”是指在人的能力范围内，如刚才所述（<a href="5623.htm">5623</a>节），因而是指尽可能。他们将银子“带回去”表示他们通过这真理使自己顺服；因为在灵界，将真理带回到主（他们从主白白得到这真理）那里，就是通过它使人的自我顺服。至于他们以哪种方式通过这样的真理使自己顺服，这从与管理约瑟家的那个人的交谈明显看出来（43:18-24）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5624</b></p><p><b>5624.</b>
And the silver that was returned in the mouth of your bags carry back in your hand. That this signifies that by means of the truth given gratuitously in the exterior natural they were to submit themselves 
as far as possible, is evident from the signification of the "silver returned," as being truth given gratuitously (see n. 5530); from the signification of "in the mouth of their bags," as being 
in the threshold of the exterior natural (see n. 5497); and from the signification of "in the hand," as being in the ability (of which just above, see n. 5623), thus as far as possible. Their submitting 
themselves by means of this truth is signified by their "carrying it back;" for in the spiritual world to carry back truth to the Lord, from whom it has been received gratuitously, is to submit one's 
self by means of it. But the manner in which they submitted themselves by its means is plain from the conversation with the man who was over Joseph's house (verses 18-24). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5624</b></p><p><b>5624.</b>
'And the silver that was put back in the mouth of your pouches you are to take back in your hand' means that through the truth freely given and present in the exterior natural they were to make themselves 
submissive as far as was possible. This is clear from the meaning of 'the silver that was put back' as truth freely given, dealt with in <a href="5530.htm">5530</a>; from the meaning of 'in the mouth of a sack' as in 
the opening of the exterior natural, dealt with in <a href="5497.htm">5497</a>; and from the meaning of 'in the hand' as within one's power, dealt with immediately above in <a href="5623.htm">5623</a>, thus as far as possible. Making themselves submissive 
through that truth is meant by the instruction that 'they were to put back' the silver; for when people in the spiritual world 'take back' truth to the Lord from whom they have received it freely 
they are making themselves submissive through it. But in what way they made themselves submissive through such truth is evident from the conversation, included in verses 18-24, which they had with 
the man who was over Joseph's house. </p>

</p><b>5624.</b>
`Et argentum reductum in ore manticarum vestrarum reducatis in manu vestra':  quod significet quod per verum gratis datum in exteriore naturali submitterent se quantum possibile, constat ex significatione 
`argenti reducti' quod sit verum gratis datum, de qua n. 5530; ex significatione `in ore manticae' quod sit in limine naturalis exterioris, de qua n. 5497; et ex significatione `in manu' quod 
sit in potentia, de qua mox supra n. 5623, ita quantum possibile; quod se submitterent per id verum, significatur per quod `reducerent'; in spirituali enim mundo reducere verum ad Dominum a quo gratis 
id acceperunt, est se per illud submittere; {1}quomodo autem se per id submiserunt, patet ex loquela cum viro qui super domum Josephi {2}, vers. 18-24. @1 quod etiam se per id submiserint, patet a timore 
in quo fuerunt propter id, et $ @2 i ante ostium$ </p>
