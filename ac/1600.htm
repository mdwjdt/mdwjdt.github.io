<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1600节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1600.</strong>“所多玛人在耶和华面前罪大恶极”表记忆知识所伸向的恶欲。这从“所多玛”和“人”的含义清楚可知：前面说过，“所多玛”表恶欲，“人”表觉性和理性之物，在此表记忆知识，因为它们论及脱离内在人的外在人。“人”表觉性和理性之物，如前所述（<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节）。当学习知识的目的只是为了使人变得伟大，而不是为了让它们为了用而服务于他，从而使他变得良善时，就说记忆知识伸向恶欲。一切记忆知识的存在都是为了使人变得理性，由此变得智慧，从而使他能服务于内在人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1600.</strong> The symbolism of the men of Sodom were very evil and sinful against Jehovah as the point of corrupt desire to which facts extended can be seen from the following: Sodom symbolizes corrupt desire, or cravings, as mentioned previously [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1600/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1587" target=_top>1587</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1600/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1598" target=_top>1598</a>]. And men symbolize intellectual and rational matters; here they symbolize facts, because they are attributed to the outer self separated from the inner. The symbolism of men as intellectual or rational matters has also been demonstrated before, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1600/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265" target=_top>265</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1600/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_749" target=_top>749</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1600/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007" target=_top>1007</a>.<br />Facts are said to extend to the point of corrupt desire when our only goal in learning them is to gain prestige, rather than to use them to help us become good. All facts exist for this purpose: to enable us to become rational and therefore wise, and in this way serve the inner self. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1600</b></p><p><b>1600.</b>
The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly. That this signifies the cupidities to which the memory-knowledges extended themselves, is evident from the signification of "Sodom," 
explained before, as being cupidities; and from the signification of "the men [viri]," as being intellectual and rational things, here, memory-knowledges, because they are predicated of the external 
man when separated from the internal. That "men" signify intellectual and rational things, was also shown above (n. 265, 749, 1007). Memory-knowledges are said to extend themselves to cupidities, when 
they are learned with no other end than that the man may become great; not that they may serve him for use, that he may thereby become good. All memory-knowledges are for the end that a man may become 
rational, and thus wise; and that thereby he may serve the internal man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1600</b></p><p><b>1600.</b>
That 'the men of Sodom were evil and great sinners before Jehovah' means the evil desires towards which facts were reaching out becomes clear from the meaning of 'Sodom' as evil desires, dealt with already, 
and from the meaning of 'men' (vir) as intellectual concepts and rational concepts, here factual knowledge since they are spoken of in reference to the external man when separated from the internal. 
That 'men' means intellectual concepts or rational concepts has been shown already in <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>. Facts are said to reach out towards evil desires when they are learned for no other purpose 
than that one may become great, and not so that they may serve the use of making one good. All facts exist to enable a person to become rational and thereby wise, and so to enable him to serve the internal man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1600</b>
</p><b>1600.</b>
'Viri Sodomae mali et peccatores Jehovae valde': quod significet cupiditates ad quas scientifica se extendebant, constare potest ex significatione 'Sodomae,' de qua prius, quod sint cupiditates; et 
ex significatione 'virorum' quod sint intellectualia et rationalia, hic scientifica quia praedicantur de externo homine cum separatus ab interno; quod 'viri' significent intellectualia seu rationalia, 
ostensum quoque est prius n. 265, 749, 1007.  Scientifica dicuntur tunc extendere se ad cupiditates, cum discantur non alio fine quam ut magnus fiat, non ut inserviant illi usui ut inde fiat bonus; omnia 
scientifica sunt ob finem ut homo possit fieri rationalis et sic sapiens, utque sic inservire possit interno homini. </p>
