<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第570节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>570.</strong>“神的众子”表信的教义事项，这一点从“众子”的含义明显可知（上述以及5章4节处，“众子”皆表教会的真理）。教会的真理是指教义事项，就其本身而言，它们就是真理，因为这里所论及的那些人依传统从上古之人那里拥有它们，所以它们被称为“神的众子”；相对而言它们也如此被称谓，因为恶欲被称为“人的众女”。此处描述的是该教会成员的秉性，他们将神圣的教会真理浸没于自己的恶欲中，从而玷污了它们；并以此确证自己强烈信服的设想。这一切如何发生的，对此，通过观察自己和他人的情形，谁都能很容易地设想出来：那些信服某个观点的人会通过视之为真理的一切，甚至包括主圣言里的东西来确认这种观点；当人们坚持自己所接受的设想时，就会信服它们，使一切赞同和支持它们。人受我欲的影响越深，就越执着于它们。该种族的秉性就是这样，关于他们，蒙主慈悲，容后再述，届时我们会探讨他们可怕的信念，说来奇怪的是，他们从不被允许通过推理流入，只能通过恶欲，否则，他们会杀死在场其他精灵的全部理性。由此清楚可知“神的众子看见人的众女美丽，就随意挑选，娶作妻子”这句经文的含义，也就是说，他们将信的教义事项与恶欲联结起来，事实上，与所有恶欲联结起来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]570.</strong> The symbolism of the sons of God as the teachings of faith is established by the symbolism of sons, dealt with just above and in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_570/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_4" target=_top>4</a> of the last chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_570/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489" target=_top>489</a>], where sons symbolized the church's truth.<br />The church has truth in the form of doctrinal teachings. Because the people described in the present chapter received them by word of mouth from the earliest people, these teachings were true in the abstract. It is for this reason that they are called the sons of God, and also because of their relation to the desires called the daughters of humankind.<br />This verse is describing those people's character, showing that they immersed the church's truth — which is holy — in their cravings and in this way defiled it. In doing so they reinforced their own firmly held assumptions.<br />The way these matters stand is something we can all evaluate by looking at ourselves and the people around us. When we convince ourselves of some idea, we prove its truth to ourselves by the use of every seemingly valid argument — even by arguments that come from the Lord's Word. As long as we cling to our adopted principles and persuasions, we force everything into agreement and harmony with them. The more we dote on ourselves, the more rigidly we stick by those ideas.<br />Such a description fits the race of people under discussion here. More will be said about them below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_570/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_573" target=_top>573</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_570/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_580" target=_top>580-586</a>a, 607:3, 619-637, 659-662, 792-813], by the Lord's divine mercy, in a further description of their hideous delusions. Surprising to say, these delusions are such that those people are never allowed to influence others with their rationalizations; if they did, they would kill all rational power in the spirits around them. They are allowed to influence others only with their desires.<br />Now it is clear what is meant by the sons of God saw the daughters of humankind, that they were good, and they took wives for themselves from among all whom they chose. The meaning is that they forged ties between the teachings of faith and their cravings — cravings of any kind whatever. </p>

That by the "sons of God" are signified doctrinal things of faith, is evident from the signification of "sons" (concerning which just above, and also in the preceding chapter, verse 4, where "sons" signify 
the truths of the church). The truths of the church are doctrinal things, which regarded in themselves were truths because those here treated of had them by tradition from the most ancient people, 
and therefore they are called the "sons of God;" they are so called also relatively, because cupidities are called the "daughters of man." The quality of the members of this church is here described, 
namely, that they immersed the truths of the church, which were holy, in their cupidities, and thereby defiled them; and in this way they confirmed the principles of which they were so strongly persuaded. 
How this occurred may be easily conceived by anyone, from observing what passes in himself and others: those who persuade themselves in regard to any subject, confirm themselves in such persuasion 
by everything which they imagine to be true, even by what they find contained in the Word of the Lord; for while they cling to principles which they have received, and have become persuaded of, 
they make everything favor and assent to them. And the more anyone is under the influence of self-love, the more firmly he holds them. Such was this race, concerning whom of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter, 
when we come to treat of their direful persuasions, which strange to say are such that they are never allowed to flow in by reasonings, but only from cupidities, for otherwise they would kill 
everything rational in the spirits present. Hence it appears what is signified by the "sons of God seeing the daughters of man, that they were good, and taking to themselves wives of all that they chose" 
namely, that they conjoined the doctrinal things of faith with their cupidities, in fact with any cupidities. </p>

The sons of God' means doctrinal matters concerning faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'sons', dealt with just above, and also from verse 4 of the previous chapter, where 'sons' meant the truths 
of the Church. Truths of the Church are matters of doctrine. These regarded in themselves were truths because those who are the subject here possessed them through what had been handed down to them 
from the most ancient people. It is for this reason that they are called 'the sons of God', and also because in relation to them evil desires are called 'the daughters of man'. Here it is describing the 
character of those people, that is to say, they were people who immersed the truths of the Church, which are holy, in their own desires, and in so doing polluted them, while at the same time confirming 
assumptions of which they were thoroughly persuaded. Anyone can judge what the situation must have been from what he finds in himself and in others. People who persuade themselves of any idea also 
confirm themselves in that idea by everything which they imagine to be the truth, including things in the Word of the Lord. For when people cling to the assumptions they have adopted and of which they 
are persuaded, they make everything favour and support them. And the more anyone loves himself, the more immovable he becomes. The character of those people will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described 
later on along with their dreadful persuasions, which are such that, miraculously, they are never allowed to flow in by their reasonings - for if they do they slay the entire rationality of other 
spirits present - but only from their evil desires. From this it is clear what the statement means about the sons of God seeing the daughters of man that they were fair, and their taking wives for themselves 
from all whom they chose, namely that they joined doctrinal matters concerning faith to evil desires, indeed to every such desire.  </p>

Quod per 'filios Dei' significentur doctrinalia fidei, constat a significatione 'filiorum,' de qua mox prius, et cap. praec. ad vers. 4, ubi 'filii' significarunt vera Ecclesiae; vera Ecclesiae sunt 
doctrinalia; quae, quia illi de quibus, per traditiones habuerunt ab antiquissimis, in se spectata vera fuerunt; quare vocantur 'filii Dei,' et quoque respective quia cupiditates vocantur 'filiae hominis.' 
Quales fuerunt, hic describitur, nempe quod vera Ecclesiae quae sancta, immerserint suis cupiditatibus, et sic conspurcaverint; inde quoque persuasissima sua principia confirmarunt: hoc quomodo 
se habet quisque potest judicare a se et aliis; qui de aliqua re sibi persuadent, ii se confirmant ab omni quod verum esse putant, etiam ab illis quae in Verbo Domini; nam cum in principiis captis et 
persuasis haerent, tunc faciunt ut omnia faveant et assentiantur, et quo magis quis se amat, eo magis obfirmat se; haec gens talis fuit, de qua ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; ubi etiam 
de diris eorum persuasionibus quae, mirum, tales sunt ut nusquam liceat eis a ratiociniis influere, tunc necant omne rationale spirituum praesentium, sed solum ex cupiditatibus. Inde constat quid significat 
'quod filii Dei viderint filias hominis, quod horae, et acceperint sibi uxores ab omnibus quas eligebant,' quod nempe doctrinalia fidei conjunxerint cum cupiditatibus, et quidem cum quibuscumque. </p>
