<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第407节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>407.</strong>教会的状态总体上就是这种情况，随着时间流逝，它背离了真正的信，直到最后根本没有信，此时就说它“荒废”了。这就是上古教会中被称为“该隐”者的情形，也是洪水后的古教会，以及犹太教会的情形。主降世时，犹太教会竟荒废到不知道主，也不知祂降世拯救他们的地步，更别说信祂了。这也是早期基督教会，也就是主降世后所建教会的情形，如今，它也彻底荒废了，以致于其中不再有信存留。尽管如此，教会的核心一直保留着，尽管那些信已荒废者不承认它；如上古教会，其“余留”一直保存到大洪水时期，并在大洪水过后仍继续存留。教会的这种“余留”被称为“挪亚”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]407.</strong> The state of a church in general is such that over time it tends to ebb away from true faith and finally terminate without any faith. When faith is gone, the church is described as devastated or ruined. That is what happened in the earliest church among those called followers of Cain. It occurred also in the ancient church, which followed the Flood. It occurred also in the Jewish church, which was so utterly devastated at the time of the Lord's Coming that they did not know anything about him or the fact that he was coming to save them; still less did they know anything about faith in him. It occurred also in the early [Christian] church — the first church following the Lord's Coming — which today is in such complete ruins that no faith remains.<br />Even so, a nucleus of the church always remains in existence, unrecognized by those whose faith has been destroyed. A remnant of the earliest church, for example, survived until the Flood and continued on after it. That church remnant is called Noah. </p>

The state of a church in general is thus circumstanced. In process of time it departs from the true faith until at last it comes to be entirely destitute of faith, when it is said to be "vastated." This 
was the case with the Most Ancient Church among those who were called Cainites, and also with the Ancient Church after the flood, as well as with the Jewish Church. At the time of the Lord's advent 
this last was in such a state of vastation that they knew nothing about the Lord, that He was to come into the world for their salvation, and they knew still less about faith in Him. Such was also the 
case with the primitive Christian Church, or that which existed after the Lord's advent, and which at this day is so completely vastated that there is no faith remaining in it. Yet there always remains 
some nucleus of a church, which those who are vastated as to faith do not acknowledge; and thus it was with the Most Ancient Church, of which a remnant remained until the time of the flood, and continued 
after that event. This remnant of the Church is called "Noah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 407</b></p><p><b>407.</b>
It generally happens with the passage of time that the Church reaches a state when it retreats from true faith and at length ends up with no faith at all. And when faith is no more the Church is said 
to be vastated. This was what happened to the Most Ancient Church among those called Cainites. It was also what happened to the Ancient Church which came after the Flood, and to the Jewish Church too, 
which had been so vastated by the time of the Lord's Coming that they did not even know anything about the Lord's coming to save them, still less anything about faith in Him. It was what happened yet 
again to the Primitive Church - the Church established after the Lord's Coming - which at the present time has been so vastated that there is not any faith there. Nevertheless some nucleus of the Church 
always remains, although those who have been vastated as to faith do not acknowledge that nucleus, as with the Most Ancient Church, a remnant of which remained up to and survived beyond the Flood. 
That remnant of the Church is called Noah.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 407</b>
</p><b>407.</b>
Ecclesiae status in genere se ita habet quod temporis tractu recedat a vera fide et tandem in nullam desinat; cum nulla, dicitur quod vastata; ita se habuit cum Ecclesia Antiquissima apud eos qua 'Cainitae' 
dicti; ita quoque cum Ecclesia Antiqua quae post diluvium; ita quoque cum Ecclesia Judaica, quae ita vastata fuit tempore Adventus Domini ut non scirent aliquid de Domino, quod venturus ad salvandum 
eos, minus aliquid de fide in Ipsum: ita quoque cum primitiva Ecclesia seu quae post Adventum Domini, quae hodie ita vastata est ut non aliqua fides: tametsi semper aliquis nucleus Ecclesiae manet, 
quem ii qui quoad fidem vastati sunt, non agnoscunt; sicut etiam ab Antiquissima Ecclesia mansit residuum usque ad diluvium et continuabatur post diluvium, quod residuum Ecclesiae vocatur 'Noah.' </p>
