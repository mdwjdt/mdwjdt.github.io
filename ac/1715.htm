<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1715节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1715.</strong>“又追到大马士革左边的何把”表到了那种程度。这从“大马士革左边的何把”的含义清楚可知。没人知道“何把”在哪里，因为圣言中再没提及它。然而，大马士革是叙利亚的首都，这清楚可见于撒母耳记下（<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下8.5.htm">8:5</a>）和以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.8.htm">7:8</a>）；大马士革和叙利亚的含义差不多（前面论及叙利亚，即创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创10.22.htm">10:22</a>，<w1>1232<w2>1232<w3>节）。迦南地的最远边界在但之外，被描述为大马士革。如阿摩司书：<br />你们抬着为你们的王索古特，你们的偶像克完，你们的神星，就是你们为自己所造的。所以我要把你们掳到大马士革以外。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.26.htm">5:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.27.htm">27</a>）<br />圣地或主国度的北界也被称为大马士革的地界（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.16.htm">47:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.1.htm">48:1</a>）。本节经文说“杀败他们，又追到大马士革左边的何把”，意思是表面的良善与真理被净化到这种程度。若不知道那些表面良善与真理的性质，它们以何种方式被净化，以至于变得纯正，就无法准确解释此处“大马士革左边的何把”的含义，只能笼统地知道它们被净化。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1715.</strong> And pursued them all the way to Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus, symbolizes the extent, as can be seen from the symbolism of Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus. Where Hobah was no one knows, because it is not mentioned again in the Word. Damascus, however, was Syria's principal city, as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_8_5-6" target=_top>2 Samuel 8:5-6</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_8" target=_top>Isaiah 7:8</a> show.{*1} The symbolism of Damascus is almost the same as that of Syria, which was discussed earlier at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_22" target=_top>Genesis 10:22</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232" target=_top>1232</a>]. Damascus is portrayed as the farthest border of the land of Canaan (although it lay beyond Dan), as in Amos:<br />You took up Sikkuth, your king; and Kaiwan, your images, the star of your gods, whom you made for yourselves; and I will deport you beyond Damascus. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_26-27" target=_top>Amos 5:26-27</a>)<br />The border of the holy land (that is, the Lord's kingdom) toward the north is identified with the border of Damascus in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_16" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_18" target=_top>18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_48_1" target=_top>48:1</a>. In the present verse, when it says that they were struck and pursued all the way to Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus,{*2} it symbolizes the extent to which apparent goodness and truth were purified. However, unless the reader knows what that apparent goodness and truth were like, and what they needed to be purified of in order to become genuine, the proper meaning of Hobah on the left of Damascus here cannot be explained. It can only be said generally that they were purified.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Unlike <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_8" target=_top>Isaiah 7:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_8_5-6" target=_top>2 Samuel 8:5-6</a> does not explicitly identify Damascus as the capital of Syria, but it does speak of Syria (and Syrians) as being "of Damascus," a designation that implies Damascus's centrality. [Editors]<br />{*2} "To the left of Damascus" means to the north; compare note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1715/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651" target=_top>1651</a>.

And pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus. That this signifies as far as this extended, is evident from the signification of "Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus." It is not known 
where Hobah was situated, as there is no further mention of it in the Word. But Damascus was the principal city of Syria (as is evident from 2 Sam. 8:5, 6; Isa. 7:8); and by it is signified almost 
the same as by Syria (spoken of before, Gen. 10:22). The farthest boundary of the land of Canaan, beyond Dan, is described as being Damascus, as in Amos: </p>
<p>     Ye have taken up Siccuth your king, and 
Chiun your images; the star of your gods which ye made to yourselves, and I will cause you to go away beyond Damascus (Amos 5:26-27). The boundary of the holy land, or of the Lord's kingdom, toward 
the north, is also called the "boundary of Damascus" (Ezek. 47:16-18, 48:1). Here, where it is said that they were smitten and driven as far as Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus, there is signified 
the extent to which the apparent goods and truths were purified. But unless it is known what was the character of the apparent goods and truths, and by what means they were purified so as to be made 
genuine, it cannot be explained what is properly meant here by Hobah, on the left of Damascus; except in a general way, that they were purified. </p>

'And he pursued them as far as Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus' means to that particular extent. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus'. Where Hobah 
was nobody knows, for it is not mentioned again in the Word. Damascus however was the capital city of Syria, as is clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%208:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 8:5, 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7:8</a>, which has almost the same meaning as Syria, dealt with 
already at Chapter 10:22. The furthest boundary of the land of Canaan, but beyond Dan, is described as being Damascus, as in Amos, </p>
<p>You have taken up Sikkuth your king, and Kiyun your images, the 
star of your gods which you made for yourselves And I will cause you to go away beyond Damascus. Amos 5:26, <a href="27.htm">27</a>. </p>
<p>The northern boundary of the holy land or the Lord's kingdom is also called the boundary 
of Damascus in Ezek. 47:16 <a href="18.htm">18</a>; 48:1. When it is said in the present verse that 'they were smitten and driven away as far as Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus', the extent to which apparent 
goods and truths were purified is meant. But unless the nature of those apparent goods and truths is known and by what means they were purified to make them genuine, no proper explanation of the meaning 
here of 'Hobah on the left of Damascus' is possible, apart from the general observation that they were purified. </p>

'Et persecutus est eos usque ad Hobam, quae a sinistra Damasco': quod significet extensionem quousque, constare potest a significatione 'Hobae quae a sinistra Damasco'; ubi Hobah, non scitur, quia amplius 
non memoratur in Verbo, sed Damascus erat urbs principalis Syriae, ut constat 2 Sam. viii 5, 6; Esai. vii 8; per quam paene idem significatur ac per Syriam, de qua prius cap. x ad vers. 22. Terminus 
ultimus terrae Canaanis, sed ultra Danem, describitur per Damascum, ut apud Amos, Suscepistis Siccuth regem vestrum, et Kiiun imagines vestras, stellam deorum vestrorum, quos fecistis vobis, et 
migrare faciam vos ultra Damascum, v 26, 27; </p>
<p>terminus terrae sanctae seu regni Domini versus septentrionem dicitur quoque terminus Damasci, Ezech. xlvii 16-18; xlviii 1. Hic cum dicitur quod 'percussi 
et profugati usque ad Hobam quae a sinistra Damasco,' significatur extensio quousque bona et vera apparentia purificata sunt; at nisi sciatur qualia illa bona et vera apparentia fuerunt, et a quibus 
purificata ut facta genuina, non explicari potest quid proprie hic intelligitur per 'Hobam a sinistra Damasco,' solum in genere quod purificata sint. </p>
