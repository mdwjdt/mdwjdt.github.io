<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2145.</strong>“亚伯拉罕坐在帐棚门口”表那时祂所具有的神圣，也就是爱的神圣，这爱用“那天正热”来表示，如下文所解释的。这从“帐棚”的含义清楚可知，“帐棚”是指神圣之物，如前所述（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="1566.htm">1566</a>节，那里也解释了“帐棚”具有这种含义的原因）。由于那时主拥有“幔利橡树”所表示的直觉，这是一种较为低级的理性真理，但却比“摩利橡树”所表示的直觉更为内在，故它在此用祂坐在帐棚门口，即坐在神圣事物的入口处来代表和表示。至于直觉是更内在还是不那么内在，这可通过上古之人所拥有的直觉来说明。我从他们那里听说，他们越沉浸于从视听之物所获得的记忆知识，其直觉就越低级；而他们越从中被提升向仁与爱的属天之物，其直觉就越内在，因为那时他们更接近主。</p>

He was sitting at the door of the tent. That this signifies the holy which at that time appertained to Him, namely, the holy of love-which is signified by the day growing hot, as explained in what follows-is 
evident from the signification of a "tent," as being what is holy (see n. 414, 1102, 1566, where also the reason of this signification of "tents" is explained). As the Lord was then in the perception 
which is signified by the oak-groves of Mamre, which is a lower rational perception, but yet is a perception more internal than that which is signified by the oak-grove of Moreh (concerning which 
see n. 1442, 1443), it is here represented and therefore signified by His sitting at the door of the tent, that is, at the entrance to what is holy. How the case is with perceptions, as being less 
or more interior, may be illustrated by the perceptions of the most ancient people, from whom I have heard that the more they were in memory-knowledges from the things which are objects of hearing and 
sight, the lower were their perceptions; but that the more they were uplifted above them to the celestial things of charity and love, the more interior their perceptions were, because they were then 
nearer to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2145</b></p><p><b>2145.</b>
'He was sitting at the tent door' means the holiness which existed with Him at that time, namely the holiness of love, which is meant by 'as the day was getting warmer', dealt with in what follows next. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'a tent' as holiness, dealt with in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="1566.htm">1566</a>. And for the reason why 'tents' meant forms of holiness, see the same paragraphs. Since the Lord at this time 
had the perception meant by the oak-groves of Mamre, which is a lower rational perception, yet more interior than that meant by the oak-grove of Moreh, dealt with in <a href="1442.htm">1442</a>, <a href="1443.htm">1443</a>, it is here represented 
and so is meant by his sitting at the tent door, that is, at the entrance to holiness. As regards perceptions being more interior or less interior, this may be illustrated from the perceptions which 
the most ancient people had. From these people I have heard that the more they were immersed in mere facts acquired from the objects of hearing and sight the lower their perceptions became; but the more 
they were raised up from them towards the celestial things of charity and love the more interior these perceptions became, as they were then closer to the Lord. </p>

`Sedens ad januam tentorii': quod significet sanctum quod tunc Ipsi, nempe sanctum amoris, qui significatur per `incalescentem diem,' de quo sequitur, constat ex significatione `tentorii' quod sit sanctum, 
de qua n. 414, 1102, 1566; et causa cur per `tentoria' significata sint sancta, ibi videatur: quia tunc Dominus fuit in perceptione quae significatur per `querceta Mamre,' quae est inferior rationalis 
sed usque interior quam quae significatur per `quercetum Moreh,' de qua n. 1442, 1443, hic repraesentatur et sic significatur per id quod `sederit ad januam tentorii,' hoc est, ad introitum ad 
sanctum: quomodo se habet cum perceptionibus quod minus et magis interiores sint, illustrari potest ab Antiquissimorum perceptionibus, ex quibus audivi quod quo plus essent in scientificis ex illis 
quae erant objecta auditus et visus, eo perceptiones eorum fuissent inferiores; at quo plus ab illis elevabantur ad caelestia charitatis et amoris, eo fuerint interiores, quia tunc propius erant Domino. </p>
