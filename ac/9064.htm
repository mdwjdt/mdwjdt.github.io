Verses 28-36. And when an ox shall strike with the horn a man or a woman, and he die, with stoning the ox shall be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; and the master of the ox shall be guiltless. 
But if the ox were wont to strike with his horn from yesterday the day before yesterday, and it hath been attested to his master, and he hath not watched him, and he hath killed a man or a woman; the 
ox shall be stoned, and his master also shall die. If expiation be laid on him, then he shall give the redemption of his soul according to all that is laid upon him. Whether he have struck with the 
horn a son, or struck with the horn a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him. If the ox shall strike with the horn a manservant, or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master 
thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. And when a man shall open a pit, or when a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall in there, the master of the pit 
shall repay; he shall pay silver to its master, and the dead one shall be his. And when a man's ox shall strike the ox of his companion, and he die, then they shall sell the living ox, and they shall 
divide the silver of it; and the dead one also they shall divide. Or if it be known that the ox was wont to strike with the horn from yesterday the day before yesterday, and his master hath not watched 
him; repaying he shall repay ox for ox, and the dead one shall be his. "And when an ox shall strike with the horn a man or a woman," signifies if the affection of evil in the natural shall injure the 
truth or the good of faith; "and he die," signifies even so as to destroy them; "with stoning the ox shall be stoned," signifies the penalty of the destroyed truth and good of faith; "and his flesh 
shall not be eaten," signifies that this evil must by no means be appropriated, but be cast out; "and the master of the ox shall be guiltless," signifies that the evil is not from the internal man, because 
it is from the will, and not from the intellectual; "but if the ox were wont to strike with his horn from yesterday the day before yesterday," signifies if the affection of evil has existed for 
a long time; "and it hath been attested to his master," signifies and this has passed into the intellectual; "and he hath not watched him," signifies no repression; "and he hath killed a man or a woman," 
signifies if it has then destroyed the good and the truth of faith; "the ox shall be stoned," signifies the penalty of destroyed truth; "and his master also shall die," signifies the damnation of 
the internal man; "if expiation be laid on him," signifies that he may be free from damnation; "then he shall give the redemption of his soul," signifies the grievous things of repentance; "according 
to all that is laid upon him," signifies according to the quality of the affection of evil from the intellectual; "whether he have struck with the horn a son, or struck with the horn a daughter," signifies 
an onset by the affection of evil against the truths and goods of faith derived from things interior; "according to this judgment shall it be done to him," signifies that the penalty shall be similar; 
"if the ox shall strike with the horn a manservant, or a maidservant," signifies if the affection of evil shall destroy truth or good in the natural, "he shall give unto their master thirty shekels 
of silver," signifies that the internal man shall make restoration in full; "and the ox shall be stoned," signifies the penalty of destroyed truth and good in the natural; "and when a man shall open 
a pit," signifies if anyone shall receive falsity from another; "or when a man shall dig a pit," signifies or if he himself have devised falsity; "and an ox or an ass shall fall in there," signifies 
which perverts good or truth in the natural; "the master of the pit shall repay," signifies that he to whom the falsity appertains shall make amends; "he shall pay silver to its master," signifies 
by truth appertaining to him whose good or truth in the natural has been perverted; "and the dead one shall be his," signifies that the evil or the falsity shall remain with him; "and when a man's ox 
shall strike the ox of his companion," signifies two truths, the affections of which are diverse, and the affection of one shall injure the affection of the other; "and he die," signifies so that the 
good affection perishes; "then they shall sell the living ox," signifies that the affection of the one which has injured the affection of the other shall be alienated; "and they shall divide the silver 
of it," signifies that the truth thereof shall be dissipated; "and the dead one also they shall divide," signifies that the injuring affection also shall be dissipated; "or if it be known that the ox 
was wont to strike with the horn from yesterday the day before yesterday," signifies if it had previously been known that such was its affection; "and his master hath not watched him," signifies and 
if he have not kept it in bonds; "repaying he shall repay ox for ox," signifies restoration in entirety; "and the dead one shall be his," signifies for the injuring affection. </p>

And if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and this has been testified to its owner' and he does not keep it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and also its owner' 
shall die. If expiation has been imposed on him<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, he shall pay for the redemption of his soul according to all that has been imposed on him. Whether it strikes a son with its horn or strikes a daughter 
with its horn, according to this judgement it shall be done to him. If the ox strikes a male slave with its horn, or a female slave, [the owner] shall give their master thirty shekels of silver; 
and the ox shall be stoned. And when a man opens a pit, or when a man digs a pit, and does not cover it, and an ox or an ass falls into it, [the owner] of the pit shall make repayment; he shall give 
silver to its owner,<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> and the dead [animal] shall be his. And when a man's ox inflicts a blow on his companion's ox, and it dies, they shall sell the living ox, and divide the silver from it; and 
they shall also divide the dead one. Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past,<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> and its owner<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> does not keep it in, he shall surely repay ox for ox; and the dead one 
shall be his. </p>
<p>'And when an ox strikes a man or a woman with its horn' means if an affection for evil in the natural injures the truth or the good of faith. 'And [the person] dies' means to the extent 
that it destroys it. 'It shall surely be stoned' means the punishment for destroying the truth or good of faith. 'And its flesh shall not be eaten' means that this evil must not by any means be 
made one's own but must be cast away. 'And the owner of the ox shall be guiltless' means that the evil is not attributable to the internal man, because it has come from the will but not from the understanding. 
'And if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past' means if the affection for evil has existed for a long time. 'And this has been testified to its owner' means, and this evil has passed 
into the understanding. 'And he does not keep it in' means failure to restrain it. 'And it kills a man or a woman' means if it then destroys the truth or the good of faith. 'The ox shall be stoned' 
means the punishment for destroying truth. 'And also its owner shall die' means damnation of the internal man. 'If expiation has been imposed on him' means in order that he may be made free from damnation. 
'He shall pay for the redemption of his soul' means painful experiences of repentance. 'According to all that has been imposed on him' means according to the nature of the affection for evil springing 
from the understanding. 'Whether it strikes a son with its horn or strikes a daughter with its hoary' means an assault made by an affection for evil on truths and forms of the good of faith that 
are derived from interior things. 'According to this judgement it shall be done to him' means that the punishment will be similar. 'If the ox strikes a male slave with its horn, or a female slave' means 
if the affection for evil destroys truth or good in the natural. '[The owner] shall give their master thirty shekels of silver' means that the internal man shall restore it completely. 'And the ox 
shall be stoned' means the punishment for destroying truth and good in the natural. 'And when a man opens a pit' means if anyone receives falsity from another. 'Or when a man digs a pit, land does not 
cover it]' means, or if the person himself fabricates it. 'And an ox or an ass falls into it' means, which perverts good or truth in the natural. 'The owner of the pit shall make repayment' means that 
the one with whom the falsity resides shall make amends. 'He shall give silver to its owner' means by means of truth with him whose good or truth in the natural has been perverted. 'And the dead [animal] 
shall be his' means that the evil or falsity will remain with him. 'And when a man's ox inflicts a blow on his companion's ox' means two truths with dissimilar affections, and the affection with 
one injures that with the other. 'And it dies' means so severely that the good affection perishes. 'They shall sell the living ox' means that the affection with the one which has injured the affection 
with the other shall be alienated. 'And divide the silver from it' means that its truth will be dispersed. 'And they shall also divide the dead one' means that the injuring affection as well will 
be dispersed. 'Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past' means if it has been known previously that its affection is such. 'And its owner does not keep it in' means, and if 
it is not held in bonds. 'He shall surely repay ox for ox' means restoration to the full. 'And the dead one shall be his' means for the injuring affection.

et testatum domino ejus, et non custodiverit eum, et occiderit virum aut mulierem, bos lapidabitur, et etiam dominus ejus morietur.  Si expiatio posita sit super illum, et dabit redemptionem animae

cornupeta ille ab heri nudius tertius, et non custodiverit eum dominus ejus, rependendo rependet bovem pro bove, et mortuus erit sibi.  `Et cum cornu ferierit bos virum (x)aut mulierem' significat si 
affectio mali in naturali laeserit verum aut bonum fidei: `et moriatur' significat usque ut destruxerit: `lapidando lapidabitur' significat poenam destructi veri et boni fidei: et non comedetur caro 
ejus' significat quod nullatenus appropriandum id malum sed ejiciendum: `et dominus bovis insons' significat quod non malum ab interno homine, quia ex voluntario et non {2} ex intellectuali: `et si bos 
cornupeta ille ab heri nudius tertius' significat si affectio mali diu fuerit: `et testatum domino ejus' significat et hoc transiverit in intellectuale: `et non custodiverit eum' significat non repressionem: 
`et occiderit virum aut mulierem' significat si destruxerit tunc verum et bonum fidei: `bos (x)lapidabitur' significat poenam destructi veri: `et etiam dominus ejus morietur' significat (x)damnationem

super illo' significat secundum quale affectionis mali ex intellectuali: `aut filium cornu ferierit, aut filiam cornu ferierit' significat insultum ab affectione mali in vera et bona fidei derivata 
ab interioribus: `secundum judicium hoc fiet ei' significat quod similis poena: `si servum cornu ferierit bos vel ancillam' significat si affectio mali destruxerit verum aut bonum in naturali: `argentum 
triginta siclorum dabit {3}domino ejus' significat quod internus homo id ad plenum restituet: `et bos lapidabitur' significat poenam destructi veri et boni in naturali: `et cum aperuerit vir foveam' 
significat si quis falsum ab altero acceperit: `vel cum foderit vir foveam' significat si vel ipse finxerit: {4} `et ceciderit illuc bos vel asinus' significat quod pervertit bonum aut verum in naturali: 
`dominus foveae rependet' significat quod is apud quem falsum emendabit: `argentum reddet domino ejus' (x)significat quod per verum apud illum cujus bonum aut verum in naturali perversum est:
