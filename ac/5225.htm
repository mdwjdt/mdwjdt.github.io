<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5225节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5225.</strong>“却没有人能给法老解释这些事”表不知道将要发生什么事。这从“解释”的含义清楚可知，“解释”是指知道将要发生什么事（参看<a href="5141.htm">5141</a>节）。因此，“没有人能解释”表示不知道；因为“没有人”在内义上表示某个事物的缺乏和不存在。事实上，对一个人的观念在内义上会转变为对某个事物的观念。例如，对男人、丈夫、女人、妻子、儿子、女儿、少年人或少女的观念会转变为对真理或良善的观念；如前面（<a href="5223.htm">5223</a>节）对术士和智慧人的观念会转变为对内层记忆知识和外层记忆知识的观念。原因是，在灵界或天堂，天使的注意力不是集中在人物身上，而是集中在属灵事物上。因为人物会限制一个观念，并将它集中在某个有限事物上；而属灵事物没有这种限制和集中，而是将它延伸到无限事物，进而延伸到主那里。这也解释了为何在天堂，没有人留意圣言中所提到的人物；而是留意这个人物所代表的事物。由于同样的原因，在天堂，也没有人留意人民或民族，只留意人民或民族的本质。事实上，在天堂，他们对圣言中关于任何人物、民族，或人民的任何历史细节都一无所知；所以他们不知道亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各或以色列民、犹太民族是谁。相反，他们明白亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、以色列民、犹太民族等分别代表什么。这解释了为何天使的语言没有任何限制，而且与其它语言相比，是一种普世语言。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5225</b></p><p><b>5225.</b>
And no one interpreted these things to Pharaoh. That this signifies that it was not known what would happen, is evident from the signification of "interpreting," as being to know what would happen (see 
n. 5141). Hence "no one interpreted" denotes not to know; for in the internal sense "no one" is the negative of a thing, and thus what is not; for the idea of a person is turned in the internal sense 
into the idea of a thing-as for instance the idea of a man, a husband, a woman, a wife, a son or daughter, a boy or maiden, is turned into the idea of truth or of good; and as above (n. 5223) the idea 
of a magician and wise man is turned into that of interior and exterior memory-knowledges. The reason of this is that in the spiritual world, or in heaven, not persons but things come into view, for 
persons limit the idea, and concentrate it upon something finite; whereas things do not limit and concentrate it, but extend it to the infinite, thus to the Lord. For this reason also, no person named 
in the Word is perceived in heaven, but in his stead the thing that is represented by that person; so also no people or nation is perceived, but only its quality. Nay, not even is any historic statement 
of the Word about a person, nation, or people, known in heaven; and consequently it is not known who Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the Israelitish people, and the Jewish nation were, but it is there perceived 
what Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the Israelitish people, and the Jewish nation denote; and the same in all other cases. Thus the angelic speech is without limitation, and is also relatively universal. </p>

'And there was no one to interpret them for Pharaoh' means that no knowledge existed of what was going to happen. This is clear from the meaning of 'interpreting' as knowing what was going to happen, 
dealt with in <a href="5141.htm">5141</a>, and therefore 'no one to interpret' means no knowledge of it since 'no one' in the internal sense means the absence and so non-existence of some reality. For the idea of a person 
is converted in the internal sense into that of some reality. For example, the idea of a man, husband, woman, wife, son, daughter, boy, or virgin is converted into the idea of some truth or form of good. 
Or, as above in <a href="5223.htm">5223</a>, the idea of a magus and a wise man is converted into that of factual knowledge, interior and exterior. The reason for this is that in the spiritual world, that is, in heaven, 
angels' attention is fixed not on persons but on spiritual realities. For persons narrow an idea down and focus it on some finite thing, whereas spiritual realities do not involve any such narrowing 
down or focusing but spread to what is Infinite, and so to the Lord. This explains too why in heaven no one ever perceives a person mentioned in the Word; instead they perceive the reality represented 
by that person. Nor for the same reason does anyone in heaven perceive a people or nation, only its essential nature. Indeed in heaven they have no knowledge at all of any historical detail in the Word 
about any person, nation, or people; consequently they have no knowledge of who Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, or the people of Israel are, nor of who the Jewish people are. Instead they perceive what is represented 
by Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the people of Israel, the Jewish people, and so on with everything else. This explains why angelic language has no limitations and is also a universal one compared 
with other languages. </p>

`Et nemo interpretans illa Pharaoni':  quod significet    quod nesciretur quid contingeret, constat ex significatione `interpretari' quod sit scire quid contingeret, de qua n. 5141, inde `nemo interpretans' 
est nescire {1}, `nemo' enim in sensu interno est negativum rei, ita `non', nam idea personae vertitur in ideam rei in sensu interno, sicut idea viri, mariti, feminae, uxoris, filii, filiae, 
pueri, virginis, in ideam veri aut boni, et sicut supra n. 5223, idea magi et sapientis in ideam scientificorum interiorum et exteriorum; causa est quia in mundo spirituali, seu in caelo, non personae 
sed res sub intuitionem veniunt, personae enim limitant ideam et concentrant ad finitum quoddam, at res non limitant et concentrant sed extendunt ad Infinitum, ita ad Dominum; inde quoque est quod nusquam 
aliqua persona quae in Verbo nominatur, in caelo percipiatur, sed loco ejus res quae per illam personam repraesentatur, ita quoque nec aliquis populus aut gens, sed quale ejus; immo etiam prorsus 
nescitur aliquod historicum Verbi de persona, gente ac populo, in caelo, consequenter {2}nec scitur quis Abraham, quis Jishak, quis Jacob, quis populus Israeliticus, et quae gens Judaica, sed percipitur 
ibi quid Abraham, quid Jishak, quid Jacob, quid populus Israeliticus, {3}quid gens Judaica{4}, ita in omnibus reliquis; inde est loquela angelica illimitata et quoque universalis respective. @1 
i id$ @2 A is much altered but appears to have been nescitur quis Abraham etc., then changed the several quis to de with ablative, later restored to quis.$ @3 i et$ @4 A i but d hoc est, quid per illos 
repraesentatur$ </p>
