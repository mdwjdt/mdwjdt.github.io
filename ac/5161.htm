<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5161节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5161.</strong>“他为众臣仆设摆筵席”表引入并联结于外层属世层。这从“筵席”和“臣仆”的含义清楚可知：“筵席”是指引入联结（参看<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>节），以及经由爱的联结并变成自己的（<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>节）；“臣仆”，即仆人是指属于外层属世层的事物。因为当人正在重生时，低级事物就被置于次要地位，并服从高级事物，或外层事物服从内层事物。当这种情况发生时，外层事物就变成仆人，内层事物则成了主人。这就是圣言中“仆人”的含义（参看<a href="2541.htm">2541</a>，<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>，<a href="3020.htm">3020</a>节）。成为“仆人”的那种人就是主所爱的人，因为正是相爱将他们联结起来，使他们看到他们对主的服侍不是束缚，而是全心全意的忠诚，因为良善从内在流入，并在那里产生这种快乐。古时，人们因种种原因设摆筵席；它们表示引入相爱，因而表示一种联结。他们也举办生日筵席；这些筵席代表新生或重生，就是通过爱，内层与外层在人里面的联结，因而天堂与世界在他里面的联结。因为这时，人里面的世俗或属世之物与属灵和属天之物联结起来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5161</b></p><p><b>5161.</b>
And he made a feast to all his servants. That this signifies initiation and conjunction with the exterior natural, is evident from the signification of a "feast," as being initiation to conjunction (see 
n. 3832), and also conjunction through love, and appropriation (n. 3596); and from the signification of "servants," as being the things of the exterior natural. For when man is being regenerated lower 
things are subordinated and subjected to higher, or exterior things to interior, the exterior things then becoming servants, and the interior, masters. Such is the signification of "servants" in 
the Word (as may be seen above, n. 2541, 3019, 3020); but they become such servants as are loved by the Lord; for it is mutual love that conjoins them, and causes their service not to be perceived as 
such, but as compliance from the heart; for good flows in from within, and produces in it this delight. In old time feasts were held for various reasons, and by them was signified initiation into mutual 
love, and thus conjunction. They were also held on birthdays; and then represented the new birth, or regeneration, which is the conjunction of the interiors with the exteriors in man through love, 
consequently is the conjunction of heaven with the world in him; for what is worldly or natural in man is then conjoined with what is spiritual and celestial. </p>

'That he made a feast for all his servants' means the introduction and joining to the exterior natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'a feast' as the introduction to a joining together, dealt with 
in <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>, and also as a joining together through love and a making one's own, <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>; and from the meaning of 'servants' as the things which belong to the exterior natural. For when a person is being 
regenerated lower things are made subordinate and subject to higher ones, that is, exterior things are made so to interior ones. When this happens the exterior things become servants, and the interior 
become masters. This is the meaning 'servants' has in the Word, see <a href="2541.htm">2541</a>, <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, <a href="3020.htm">3020</a>. But the kinds of people who become 'servants' are those who are loved by the Lord, for it is mutual love which joins 
them together and leads them to see their service to Him not as bondage but as whole-hearted allegiance, since good enters from within to produce that kind of delight there. In former times feasts 
were held for various reasons; and they meant an introduction into mutual love and so meant a joining together. Feasts were also held on birthdays; these represented the new birth or regeneration, which 
is a joining, through love, of a person's interiors to his exteriors, consequently a joining together in him of heaven and the world. For what is worldly or natural in a person is joined to what is 
spiritual and celestial. </p>

`Et fecit convivium omnibus servis suis': quod significet initiationem et conjunctionem cum exteriore naturali, constat ex significatione `convivii' quod sit initiatio ad conjunctionem, de qua n. 
3832, et quod quoque {1} conjunctio per amorem et appropriatio, n. 3596; et ex significatione `servorum' quod sint illa quae exterioris naturalis sunt; nam cum regeneratur homo, tunc inferiora subordinantur 
et subjiciuntur superioribus, seu exteriora interioribus; {2} exteriora tunc fiunt servi, et interiora domini; </p>
<p>talia per `servos' in Verbo significantur, videatur n. 2541, 3019, 3020; sed 
tales `servi' fiunt quales amantur a Domino, est enim mutuus amor qui conjungit, qui facit ut non appercipiatur ut servitus sed sicut obsequium ex corde, influit enim bonum ab interiore, quod facit 
ibi tale jucundum. Convivia olim fiebant ob varias causas: significabatur{3} per illa initiatio in amorem mutuum, et sic conjunctio; etiam fiebant diebus nativitatis et per illa tunc repraesentabatur 
nascentia e novo seu regeneratio, quae est conjunctio interiorum cum exterioribus apud hominem per amorem, consequenter conjunctio caeli cum mundo apud illum, nam mundanum seu naturale apud hominem 
conjungitur tunc cum spirituali et caelesti. @1 i sit $ @2 i et$ @3 i enim$ </p>
