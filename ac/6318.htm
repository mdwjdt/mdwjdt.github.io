<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6318节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6318.</strong>还有些人比感官化更甚，就是肉体化了；他们是那些反对神性最为坚决，将一切都归于自然，从而过着除非在表面上，否则就毫不关心公义与公平的生活之人。这些人内心像野兽，尽管表面上看似人，比感官化更甚；到了来世，在他们自己和其他人看来，他们就像肉体化的人。我看见他们在前面，靠近我的右脚，从一个深渊上来；他们看上去毛烘烘的，可以说又坚硬又粗野。他们一升上来，那里就出现了看似悬在他们头上的一把剑一样的东西。我与他们交谈，他们说，在他们看来，他们就像在肉体中。</p>

There are also men who are more than sensuous, namely, corporeal, and are those who have wholly confirmed themselves against the Divine, and have ascribed all things to nature, and thus have lived without 
any regard for what is just and fair, except only in the outward form. These being inwardly like brute animals (although outwardly they appear like men) are more than sensuous, and in the other 
life appear to themselves and others as if they were corporeal. They have been seen by me in front near the right foot, rising up out of the deep, very hairy, and as it were rough and gross; and when 
they had risen up there appeared the semblance of a sword hanging over their heads. I spoke with them, and they said it appeared to them exactly as if they were in the body. </p>

There are also people who think on a level lower than that of the senses, namely the level of the body; they are those who have set themselves most firmly against belief in the Divine and have ascribed 
everything to natural forces, and so have led lives that took no account, except to outward appearances, of what was right and fair. Since they are inwardly like animals, though outwardly they look 
like human beings, they think on a level lower than that of the senses, and look to themselves and to others in the next life like people with physical bodies. I have seen them in a frontal position, 
close to my right foot, rising up from a deep place; they looked extremely hairy, and tough and coarse so to speak. Once they had risen up there appeared what looked like a sword hanging over their head. 
I spoke to them and they said it appeared to them exactly as if they were in the body. </p>

Sunt {1}etiam homines qui plus quam sensuales sunt, qui nempe corporei, et sunt illi qui se prorsus confirmaverunt contra Divinum et adscripserunt omnia naturae, et {2}sic absque ulla ratione justi 
et aequi, nisi solum in externa forma, vixerunt; illi quia sicut bruta animalia intus sunt, tametsi ut homines appareant extus, sunt plus sensuales, et apparent {3} sibi et aliis in altera vita sicut 
corporei.  Illi mihi (x)visi sunt antrorsum prope ad pedem dextrum, assurgentes ex profundo, criniti valde, et quasi duri et crassi; cum assurrexerunt, apparuit instar ensis imminentis capiti eorum:  
locutus sum cum illis, et dicebant quod {4}appareat sibi prorsus sicut forent in corpore. @1 enim$ @2 ideo$ @3 i quoque$ @4 omnia et singula appareant illis$  </p>
