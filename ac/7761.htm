<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7761节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7761.</strong>属灵良善和属世良善之间有清晰的区分。如前所述，属灵良善从信之真理、它们的数量和联系获得其具体品质。但属世良善是人与生俱来的，也由偶然事件产生，如由不幸、疾病等等产生。属世良善拯救不了任何人，但属灵良善则能拯救所有人。原因在于，通过信之真理形成的良善是天堂能流入的一个层面，也就是主经由天堂流入的一个层面，以便引导人，阻止他作恶，后来则把他提入天堂；但属世良善不是这样。因此，那些处于属世良善的人能被虚假带走，容易得像被真理带走一样，只要虚假外表上看似真理。他们也能被邪恶引导，容易得像被良善引导一样，只要邪恶表现为良善。他们就像风中的羽毛。</p>

A clear distinction must be made between spiritual good and natural good. As before said, spiritual good has its quality from the truths of faith, their abundance, and their connection; but natural good 
is born with the man, and also arises by accident, as by misfortunes, diseases, and the like. Natural good saves no one, but spiritual good saves all. The reason is that the good which is formed through 
the truths of faith is a plane into which heaven can flow, that is, the Lord through heaven, and lead man, and withhold him from evil, and afterward uplift him into heaven; but not so natural good; 
and therefore they who are in natural good can be as easily carried away by falsity as by truth, provided the falsity appears in the form of truth; and they can be as easily led by evil as by good, 
provided the evil is presented as good. They are like feathers in the wind. </p>

A clear distinction should be drawn between spiritual good and natural good. Spiritual good, as has been stated, derives its particular quality from the truths of faith, the quantity of them, and their 
connection with one another. But natural good is inborn, and also is engendered by things that happen by chance, such as misfortunes, illnesses, and the like. Natural good saves no one, whereas spiritual 
good saves all. The reason for this is that the good which is given form by the truths of faith provides heaven - that is, the Lord through heaven - with a level to flow into, in order to lead 
the person, withhold him from evil, and subsequently raise him to heaven. But natural good is not like that. People therefore whose good is merely natural can be carried away by falsity as easily as by 
truth, provided that in outward appearance the falsity looks like truth. They can also be led as easily by evil as by good, provided that the evil is presented as good. They are like feathers in the wind. </p>

Probe distinguendum est inter {1}bonum spirituale et {1}bonum naturale; {1}bonum spirituale suum quale habet a veris fidei, eorum copia, et nexu, ut dictum est; {1}bonum autem naturale connascitur, 
et quoque existit per accidentia, ut per infortunia, morbos, et similia; bonum naturale nullum salvat, bonum autem spirituale omnes salvat; causa est quia bonum quod formatur per vera fidei est planum 
in quod influere potest caelum, hoc est, Dominus per caelum, ac ducere hominem, et detinere illum a malo, ac postea elevare caelum; bonum autem naturale non ita; quare illi qui in bono naturali sunt 
tam facile auferri possunt a falso quam a vero, modo falsum appareat {2}in forma veri; et tam facile duci possunt a malo quam a bono, modo malum sistatur ut bonum; sunt sicut plumae an vento. 	@1 d bonum
