<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6786.</strong>“给羊群喝”表那些属那里的教会之人。这从“羊群”的含义清楚可知，“羊群”是指那些处于良善，并允许自己被教导的人（参看<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="3772.htm">3772</a>，<a href="5913.htm">5913</a>，<a href="6048.htm">6048</a>节），在此是指那些属那里的教会之人，如前所示，即那些处于简单良善的真理，由“米甸”来表示的人。“羊群”既表示良善，也表示教会，也就是那些处于良善并属于教会的人，因为这二者如此结合在一起，以致这一个不可能离开那一个。事实上，凡处于信之真理的人都是一个教会，凡拥有教会在里面的人都处于信之良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6786</b></p><p><b>6786.</b>
And gave drink to the flock. That this signifies those who are of the church there, is evident from the signification of "flock," as being those who are in good, and who suffer themselves to be instructed 
(see n. 343, 3772, 5913, 6048); here those who are of the church there, who, as was shown above, are they who are in the truth of simple good, and are signified by "Midian." "Flock" signifies both 
good, and the church, that is, those who are in good and are of the church, because the two are so conjoined that one cannot be separated from the other; for he who is in the good of faith is a church, 
and he who is a church is in the good of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6786</b></p><p><b>6786.</b>
'And watered the flock' means those who belonged to the Church there. This is clear from the meaning of 'the flock' as those who are governed by good and who allow themselves to be instructed, dealt 
with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="3772.htm">3772</a>, <a href="5913.htm">5913</a>, <a href="6048.htm">6048</a>, here those who belonged to the Church there, namely those who are guided by the truth that goes with simple good and are meant by 'Midian', as shown above. 'The flock' means 
both good and the Church, that is, those who are governed by good and belong to the Church, for the two things are so bound up together that one is inseparable from the other. One who is governed 
by the good of faith has the Church in him; and one who has the Church in him is governed by the good of faith. </p>

</p><b>6786.</b>
`Et potavit gregem': quod significet illos qui ab Ecclesia ibi, constat ex significatione `gregis' quod sint qui in bono, quique se instrui patiuntur, de qua n. 343, 3772, 5913, 6048, hic illi qui ab 
Ecclesia ibi, qui quod sint qui in vero simplicis boni et significantur per `Midianem,' supra ostensum est.  `Grex' significat et bonum et Ecclesiam, hoc est, illos qui in bono sunt et ab Ecclesia, 
nam ea ita conjuncta sunt ut unum ab altero separari nequeat; qui enim in bono fidei est, is est Ecclesia, et qui Ecclesia est, is in bono fidei est. </p>
