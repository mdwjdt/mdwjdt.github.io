<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6206.</strong>要进一步知道，一切邪恶皆来自地狱，一切良善皆经由天堂来自主。然而，邪恶之所以被归给一个人，是因为他相信并说服自己：他凭自己思想并行出邪恶，以这种方式将它变成他自己的。如果他相信事情的真相，那么邪恶就不会被归给他，相反来自主的良善则会被归给他；因为邪恶一流入，他就会反思，这邪恶来自与他同在的恶灵；他一这样思想，天使就会抵挡并击退这邪恶。因为天使的流注进入一个人所知、所信的东西，而不进入他所不知、不信的东西；因为他们的流注不会固定在任何地方，除非那里有属于此人的某种东西。当一个人以这种方式将某种邪恶变成他自己的时，他便获得了这邪恶所产生的一个气场；那些处于类似邪恶气场的地狱灵人便与该气场联系在一起；因为同类与同类结合。与一个人或一个灵人同在的属灵气场就是一种从他的爱之生命所流出的散发物，从中远远地就能得知他的品质。在来世，所有人都照着各个气场联结在一起，社群也是照着各个气场彼此联结。他们还照着他们的气场分离，因为对立的气场会相互冲突和排斥。因此，对邪恶的爱之气场全都在地狱；对良善的爱之气场则全都在天堂；也就是说，住在这些气场中的人都在那里。</p>

Be it further known that all evil flows in from hell, and all good through heaven from the Lord. But the reason why evil is appropriated to a man is that he believes and persuades himself that he thinks 
and does it from himself, and in this way makes it his own. If he believed as is really the case, then evil would not be appropriated to him, but good from the Lord would be appropriated to him; for 
the moment that evil flowed in, he would reflect that it was from the evil spirits with him, and as soon as he thought this, the angels would avert and reject it. For the influx of the angels is into 
what a man knows and believes, but not into what a man does not know and does not believe; for their influx is not fixed anywhere except where there is something appertaining to the man. [2] When 
a man appropriates evil to himself in this way, he gets for himself a sphere of that evil, which sphere is that to which those spirits from hell adjoin themselves who are in the sphere of a like evil; 
for like is conjoined with like. The spiritual sphere with a man or a spirit is an exhalation flowing forth from the life of his loves, from which his quality is known at a distance. All in the other 
life are conjoined together in accordance with the spheres, and so also are the societies one with another; and according to their spheres they are also dissociated, for opposite spheres come into collision, 
and mutually repel each other. Therefore the spheres of the loves of evil are all in hell, and the spheres of the loves of good are all in heaven; that is, they who are in these spheres. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6206</b></p><p><b>6206.</b>
To take the subject further, it should be recognized that all evil flows in from hell and all good from the Lord by way of heaven. The reason however why evil becomes a person's own is that he believes 
and convinces himself that he thinks and practises it all by himself. In this way he makes it his own. But if he believed what is really so, it would not be evil but good from the Lord that became 
his own. For if he believed what is really so he would think, the instant evil flowed in, that it came from the evil spirits present with him; and since that was what he thought the angels could ward 
that evil off and repel it. For influx from angels takes place into what a person knows and believes, not what he does not know or believe; there is nowhere else for it to become firmly established than 
in something the person knows or believes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When a person in that way makes some evil his own he acquires the sphere that is a product of that evil. This sphere is what the spirits from hell 
who have a sphere of like evil around them associate themselves with, for like is linked to like. The spiritual sphere existing with man or spirit is an emanation from the life which belongs to his loves, 
from which his character is recognized from afar. Their spheres are what determine the ways in which all are joined to one another in the next life, and the ways in which communities are joined too. 
They also determine the separations that take place, for contrary spheres conflict with and repel one another. Consequently the spheres produced by the loves of what is evil are all in hell, while 
the spheres produced by the loves of what is good are all in heaven, that is, those dwelling in such spheres are there. </p>

</p><b>6206.</b>
Porro sciendum quod omne malum influat ab inferno et omne bonum per caelum a Domino; quod autem malum approprietur homini, est causa quia homo credit et persuadet sibi quod id cogitet et faciat a se, 
ita id suum facit; si crederet sicut res se habet, tunc non appropriaretur ei malum sed appropriaretur ei bonum a Domino; nam tunc ilico cum influeret malum, cogitaret quod esset a malis spiritibus 
apud illum, et cum hoc cogitaret, angeli averterent et rejicerent illud; nam angelorum influxus est in id quod homo scit et credit, non autem in id quod homo non scit et non credit; non senim alibi figitur 
quam ubi estaliquid apud hominem.  [2]Cum homo sic appropriat ibi malum, comparat sibi sphaerum istius mali, quae sphaera est cui adjungunt se spiritus ab inferno qui in similis mali sphaera sunt, 
nam simile simili conjungitur. Sphaera spiritualis apud hominem aut spiritum est exhalatio effluens a vita amorum ejus ex qua cognoscitur ad distantiam qualis est; secundum sphaeras conjunguntur omnes 
in altera vita, etiam societates inter se; et quoque dissociantur, nam sphaerae oppositae collidunt et se mutuo repellunt; inde sphaerae amorum mali omnes in inferno sunt, et sphaerae amorum boni 
omnes in caelo sunt, hoc est, ii qui in illis sunt. </p>
