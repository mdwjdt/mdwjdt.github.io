<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>594.</strong>“连人和走兽，并爬行物”指凡属意愿之物都会毁灭他。这一点从“人”、“走兽”和“爬行物”的含义清楚可知。人之所以为人唯独凭借意愿与觉知，正是它们使人区别于动物。人在其它方面与动物极其相似。对于那些年代的人来说，所有向善的意愿和所有对真理的觉知都消亡了。疯狂的欲望取代了向善的意愿，疯狂的幻想取代了对真理的觉知，这些幻想和欲望混在一起。可以说，他们就这样摧毁了自己的余留，所以等待他们的只有灭亡。从前面有关走兽和爬行物的阐述清楚可知，凡属意愿之物皆被称为“走兽和爬行物”。然而，鉴于此处所探讨之人的秉性，“走兽”并非表善情，而是表恶情，即恶欲，“爬行物”表肉体和感官的快乐。走兽与爬行物所具有的这种含义无需从圣言进一步证实，因为前文已予以阐释（参阅<a href="45.htm">45</a>-<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>-<a href="143.htm">143</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]594.</strong> The meaning of from human to beast to creeping animal as the fact that whatever was in their will would annihilate them can be seen from the symbolism of human, beast, and creeping animal.<br />A human is human only by virtue of will and intellect. These faculties distinguish humans from animals. All other characteristics are shared between them. Among the people being described here, every impulse for good and every inkling of truth had died out. Insane longings arose to replace the will for good and absurd delusions to replace the comprehension of truth, and these delusions joined forces with those longings. So after these people had essentially blotted out all remaining traces of will and intellect in this way, they themselves necessarily became extinct.<br />Prior discussions of beasts and creeping animals have established the fact that all aspects of the will are referred to as these creatures [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_44" target=_top>44-46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a>]. Here, though, because of the nature of the people described, beasts do not symbolize positive emotions but negative ones, and consequently corrupt desires. And creeping animals symbolize the lower pleasures — bodily and sensual pleasures.<br />There is no further need for proof from the Word that animals and reptiles have this symbolism, since examples appear above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143" target=_top>143</a>; please see there. </p>

Both man and beast, and creeping thing. That this signifies that whatsoever is of the will would extinguish him, is evident from the signification of "man" of "beast" and of "creeping thing." Man is 
man solely from the will and understanding, by which he is distinguished from brutes; in all other respects he is very similar to them. In the case of these men all will of good and understanding of truth 
had perished. In place of a will of good there followed insane cupidities, in place of an understanding of truth insane phantasies; and these were commingled with their cupidities, so that after 
they had thus as it were destroyed remains, they could not but be extinguished. That all things of the will are called "beasts" and "creeping things" is evident from what has been said before concerning 
beasts and creeping things. But here, because of the character of the man treated of, good affections are not signified by "beasts" but evil, consequently cupidities; and by "creeping things" pleasures, 
both bodily and sensuous. That such things are signified by "beasts" and "creeping things" needs no further confirmation from the Word, because they have been treated of before (see n. 45, 46, 142, 143). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 594</b></p><p><b>594.</b>
'From man [even] to beast and even to creeping thing' means that everything belonging to his will would bring about his end. This is clear from the meaning of 'man', 'beast', and 'creeping thing'. Man 
is not human except by virtue of his will and understanding, which set him apart from animals. In all other respects man and animals are very similar. With the people of those times all will for good 
and all understanding of truth perished. Insane desires took the place of the will for good and insane delusions took the place of the understanding of truth, and these delusions and desires were mingled 
together. Consequently after they had destroyed their remnants in this way so to speak, they were inevitably destroyed. It is clear from what has been shown already about beasts and creeping things 
that whatever belongs to the will is called 'beasts and creeping things'. Here however because of the kind of man who is the subject 'beasts' does not mean good but evil affections, that is, evil 
desires, and 'creeping things' means pleasures both of the body and of the senses. That beasts and creeping things have such meanings requires no further confirmation from the Word, since they have been 
dealt with already; see <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>.

</p><b>594.</b>
Quod 'ab homine ad bestiam, et usque ad reptile' significet quod quicquid est voluntatis, exstingueret eum, constat ex significatione 'hominis, bestiae, et reptilis': homo non est homo nisi a voluntate 
et intellectu, per quae distinguitur a brutis, cetera sunt simillima iis; apud hos periit omnis voluntas boni et intellectus veri; loco voluntatis boni successerunt vesanae cupiditates, loco intellectus 
veri vesanae phantasiae, et hae commixtae illis; quare postquam sic quasi deleverunt reliquias, non potuerunt non exstingui: quod quicquid est voluntatis 'bestiae et reptilia' vocantur, constat 
ab iis quae prius de bestiis et reptilibus ostensa sunt; sed hic quia de tali homine agitur, non significantur per 'bestias' bonae affectiones, sed malae, proinde cupiditates; et per 'reptilia' voluptates 
tam corporeae quam sensuales.  Quod 'bestiae et reptilia' significent talia, non amplius eget confirmatione ex Verbo quia de iis prius, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, quae videantur. </p>
