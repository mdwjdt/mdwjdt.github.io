<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10372节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10372</strong>.“这是我和以色列人之间的一个证据，直到一个时代”表这是区分那些属教会的人和那些不属教会的人的方法。这从“一个证据”的含义和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“一个证据”是指认识他们的方法（参看<a href="10357.htm">10357</a>节），因而也是区分他们的方法；“以色列人”是指教会（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节提到的地方）。因此，“耶和华和以色列人之间的一个证据”表示这是区分那些属教会的人和那些不属教会的人的方法，也就是说，通过他们对神性在主之人身里面的合一的承认而来区分他们（参看<a href="10370.htm">10370</a>节）。不承认主的地方没有教会，这也是教会本身的教导；神性本身在祂的人身里面，这是主自己在约翰福音中的教导：<br />我与父原为一。你们要相信，父在我里面，我也在父里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">38</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，父啊，时候到了，愿你荣耀你的儿子，使你的儿子也荣耀你。我的一切都是你的，你的一切也是我的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />如今人子得了荣耀，　神在人子身上也得了荣耀。神要因自己荣耀祂。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>）<br /><br />你们若认识我，也就认识我的父。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。看见我的，就已经看见了父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>）</p>

It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel to an age. That this signifies that by this, those who are of the church are distinguished from those who are not of the church, is evident from the signification 
of "a sign," as being that by which they are known (see above, n. 10357), thus also by which they are distinguished; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the church (see 
the places cited in n. 9340). Consequently by "a sign between Jehovah and the sons of Israel" is signified that this is that by which those who are of the church are distinguished from those who are 
not of the church; namely, by the acknowledgment of the union of the Divine in the Lord's Human (see n. 10370). That there is no church where the Lord is not acknowledged, the church itself also teaches; 
and that in His Human is the Divine Itself, the Lord Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     The Father and I are one. Believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father (John 10:30, 38).      Believest 
thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? (John 14:10).      Jesus said, Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son may glorify Thee. All Mine are Thine, and all Thine 
are Mine (John 17:1, 10).      Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him; and God shall glorify Him in Himself (John 13:31-32).      If ye have known Me, ye have known My Father 
also; and from henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him. He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father (John 14:7, 9). </p>

'This is a sign between Me and the children of Israel into an age' means that this is the means by which those who belong to the Church are distinguished from those who do not belong to the Church. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'a sign' as the means by which they are recognized, dealt with above in <a href="10357.htm">10357</a>, and so also by which they are distinguished; and from the representation of 'the children 
of Israel' as the Church, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>, so that 'a sign between Jehovah and the children of Israel' means that it is the means by which those who belong to the Church 
are distinguished from those who do not, that is to say, they are distinguished by their acknowledgement of the union of the Divine within the Lord's Human, dealt with above in <a href="10370.htm">10370</a>. The truth that 
the Church does not exist where the Lord is not acknowledged is also the teaching of the Church itself; and the further truth that within His Human there is the Divine itself is the Lord's own teaching 
in John,  </p>

`Inter Me et inter filios Israelis signum hoc in saeculum': quod (x)significet quod per id distinguantur illi qui ex Ecclesia ab illis qui non ex Ecclesia sunt, constat ex significatione `signi' quod 
sit id per quod noscuntur, de qua supra n. 10,357; ita quoque per quod distinguuntur; ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint Ecclesia, de qua in locis citatis n. 9340; inde per `signum inter 
Jehovam et inter filios Israelis' significatur quod id sit per quod distinguuntur illi qui ex Ecclesia ab illis qui non ex Ecclesia {1}, nempe per agnitionem unionis Divini in Humano Domini, de qua 
supra n. 10,370. Quod non Ecclesia sit ubi Dominus non agnoscitur, docet etiam ipsa Ecclesia, {2}et quoque quod in Humano ipsius sit Ipsum Divinum, docet Ipse Dominus: apud Johannem, 	Pater et Ego 
unum sumus; credatis quod Pater in Me et Ego in Patre, x 30, 38: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Nonne credis quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me? xiv 6-11: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Jesus dixit, Venit hora; Pater, glorifica Filium 
Tuum, ut et Filius Tuus glorificet Te: omnia Mea Tua sunt, et omnia Tua Mea, xvii (x)1, 10: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Nunc glorificatus est Filius hominis, et Deus glorificatus est in Ipso, et Deus glorificabit 
Ipsum in Se Ipso, xiii 31, 32: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Si cognovistis Me, etiam Patrem Meum cognovistis, et abhinc cognovistis Illum, et vidistis Illum; qui vidit Me, vidit Patrem, xiv 6-11.{3} @1 i 
sunt$ @2 inde sequitur quod illi qui ex Ecclesia sunt, distinguuntur ab illis qui non ex Ecclesia sunt, per agnitionem illam; per agnitionem Domini intelligitur agnitio Divini in Humano Ipsius, secundum 
Ipsius Domini verba$ @3 See p. ix preliminary note 1.  A ends here.$ </p>
