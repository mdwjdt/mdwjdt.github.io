<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2685节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2685.</strong>“退后约一箭之远”表那种状态距离真理的教义何等遥远。这从“退后”和“箭”的含义清楚可知：“退后”是指远离，“箭”是指真理的教义，如下一节所述。“远”（Shot）表尽可能地远，就像离弦之箭那么远。此处之所以采用“一箭之远”（a bowshot）这个词，是因为箭论及属灵之人，属灵之人也被称为“弓箭手”，如下面20节对他的论述，即“他住在旷野，成了弓箭手”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2685</b></p><p><b>2685.</b>
Withdrawing about a bowshot. That this signifies how distant the state was from the doctrine of truth, is evident from the signification of "withdrawing," as being to be distant; and from the signification 
of a "bow," as being the doctrine of truth (concerning which presently); a "shot" signifies as far distant as possible, since it was as far as an arrow could be sent by a bow. It is here said a 
"bowshot," because a "bow" is predicated of the spiritual man, and he is a shooter of the bow-as is said of him in verse 20 below: "and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became a shooter of the bow." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2685</b></p><p><b>2685.</b>
'Withdrawing herself about a bowshot' means the extent to which the state was away from the doctrine of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'being withdrawn from' as being away from, and from the 
meaning of 'a bow' as the doctrine of truth, dealt with in the next paragraph. 'Shot' means that it was as far away as possible, as far away as an arrow could be shot from a bow. Here the expression 
'a bowshot' is used because the bow is used in reference to the spiritual man, who is also called 'an archer', as he is in verse 20 - 'and he dwelt in the wilderness, and was an archer'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2685</b>
</p><b>2685.</b>
`Elongando se circiter jactum arcus':  quod significet statum quantum abesset a doctrina veri, constat a significatione `elongari' quod sit abesse; et a significatione `arcus' quod sit doctrina veri, 
de qua mox sequitur; `jactus' significat quod tantum abesset quantum usquam posset, sicut quantam jaculum ab arcus, posset emitti hic `jactus arcus, dicitur, quia de spirituali homine praedicatur arcus 
et quod `is jaculator arcus,' ut de eo in vers. seq. 20, `et habitavit in deserto, et fuit jaculator arcus.' </p>
