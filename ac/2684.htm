<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2684节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2684.</strong>“自己走开，独自在远处坐下”表思想状态。这从“走开”、“独自坐下”，以及“在远处坐下”的含义清楚可知，这些词语适用于前后文所发生的事。“走开”，即此处从孩子那里走开表除去属灵真理；经上说她退后“约一箭之远”则进一步表达并确定这种除去。“独自坐下”表孤独的状态，诸如悲伤绝望下的思想状态。“远处”表她不忍看，又不忍不看；“看”表思考（参看<a href="2245.htm">2245</a>节）；她说“我不忍见这孩子死，就在远处坐下”也进一步表达并确定了这一点。因此，那些经历真理的荒凉，随之经历绝望之人的思想状态就是体现在这些话中。</p>

And she went and sat by herself over against him. That this signifies a state of thought, is evident from the signification of "going," and also of "sitting by herself," and this over against, as applied 
to the things that precede and that follow. To "go," here to go away from the child, signifies removal from spiritual truth; which is further expressed and determined by her withdrawing about a bowshot. 
To "sit by one's self," signifies a solitary state, such as is that of thought in grief and despair; "over against," signifies that she might not look on, and yet might look on; that to "look 
on" means to think, see above (n. 2245); this is also further expressed and determined by her saying, "Let me not see the death of the child; and she sat over against." There is thus involved in these 
words the state of thought of those who are in desolation of truth, and in the consequent despair. </p>

'She went and sat by herself some distance away' means a state of thought. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'going' and also of 'sitting by herself' and of doing so 'some distance away' as these 
phrases are used in connection with what comes before and after. 'Going' - here going away from the boy - means a removal from spiritual truth, which removal is further expressed and defined by its 
being said that she withdrew 'about a bowshot'. 'Sitting by herself' means a state of feeling alone, as the state of thought is during grief and despair. 'Some distance away' means so that she could not 
bear to look and yet could not bear not to look - for 'looking' means thinking, see <a href="2245.htm">2245</a>, which also is further expressed and defined by her saying, 'Let me not see the death of the boy; and she sat 
some distance away'. Thus embodied in these words is the state of thought of those who experience desolation of truth and consequently experience despair. </p>

`Ivit, et sedit sibi e regione': quod significet statum cogitationis, constare potest ex significatione `ire,' tum `sedere sibi, et hoc `e regione,' applicate ad illa qua' praecedunt et quae sequuntur 
`ire,' hic abire a puero, significat remotionem a vero spirituali, quae ulterius exprimitur et determinatur per quod elongaverit se circiter `ad jactum arcus'; `sedere sibi' significat statum solitarium 
qualis est cogitationis in dolore et desperatione; `e regione' significat ut non prospiceret et usque prospiceret; quod `prospicere' sit cogitare, videatur n. 2245, quod etiam ulterius exprimitur 
et determinatur per quod dixerit `ne videam mortem pueri, et sedit e regione'; ita illis verbi; involvitur status cogitationis eorum qui in desolatione veri ac desperatione inde sunt. </p>
