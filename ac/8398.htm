<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8398节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8398.</strong>“以色列人的全会众到了汛的旷野”表到达试探的另一个状态。这从“到了”、“以色列人的会众”、“旷野”和“罪”的含义清楚可知：“到了”是指“起行”所表示（参看<a href="8397.htm">8397</a>节）的下一个阶段的一个点；“以色列人的会众”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（<a href="7843.htm">7843</a>节）；“旷野”是指经历试探时的一个状态；“罪”是指这个状态的本质；因为名字包含所论述的事物的整个本质，如前面各处所示。由于对缺乏食物和肉的怨言表示试探，吗哪和鹌鹑表示之后的安慰，所以“汛”表示什么就显而易见了，即表示作为由真理所产生的良善。因此，“汛”，即埃及的一座城市（汛的旷野由这城而得名），在反面意义表示由虚假所产生的邪恶。以西结书：<br />我必将我的忿怒倒在汛，就是埃及的力量上，并要剪除挪的众人。我必在埃及中使火着起，汛必大大痛苦，挪必被攻破，挪弗终日见仇敌。亚文和比伯实的少年人必倒在剑下，这些人必被掳掠。我在答比匿折断埃及诸轭的时候，那里的日子必变为黑暗。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结30.15.htm">30:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结30.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处论述的是那些拥有记忆知识，却利用它们来孵化产生邪恶的虚假之人；“埃及”在此是指记忆知识；“汛”是指由虚假所产生的邪恶；“挪”是指产生邪恶的虚假。<br />此处隐藏着比显现在文字上的更深的一层意义，对此，单单考虑这一点，谁都能看出来，即：圣言是神性，若没有更深层次的意义在其中，那么它几乎没有任何可理解的意义，更没有包含神圣之物的意义。由此很清楚地看出，在圣言中，名字是对真实事物的描述，这些描述提供了适合来自耶和华的圣言的一个总体或笼统的意义。凡承认圣言是神性的人只要愿意理性思考，或出于一种得到些许光照的理解力下结论，都无法否认这一点。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8398</b></p><p><b>8398.</b>
And all the assemblage of the sons of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin. That this signifies unto another state of temptation, is evident from the signification of "coming," as being the abode of 
the successive that is signified by "journeying" (see n. 8397); from the signification of "the assemblage of the sons of Israel," as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 7843); from the signification 
of "the wilderness," as being a state of undergoing temptations (see n. 8098); and from the signification of "Sin," as being the quality of this state; for names include the whole quality 
of the state of the thing treated of, as has been abundantly shown above. From the temptation which is signified by the murmuring on account of the lack of bread and flesh, and from the consolation afterward 
which is signified by the manna and the quail, it is evident what "Sin" signifies, namely, the good which is from truth. Consequently "Sin," which was a city of Egypt, and from which the wilderness 
of Sin took its name, in the opposite sense signifies the evil which is from falsity, in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will pour out My wrath upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude 
of No; and I will set a fire in Egypt, grieving Sin shall grieve, and No shall be for a breaking through, and Noph for the enemies daily; the young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword, 
and these shall go into captivity; and in Tehaphnehes the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt (30:15-18); </p>
<p>[2] here are treated of those who are in memory-knowledges, 
and hatch therefrom falsities from which are evils; "Egypt" here denotes memory-knowledge; "Sin," the evil which is from falsity; and "No," the falsity from which is evil. That a deeper sense lies concealed 
here than that which stands forth in the letter, can be seen by everyone from this consideration alone-that the Word is Divine, and that, unless a deeper sense were in it, there would be scarcely 
any sense that can be apprehended, still less a sense containing what is holy. Hence it is very manifest that the names in the Word denote things, and that from them there results a general sense 
that is worthy of the Word which is from Jehovah. He who acknowledges the Word to be Divine cannot possibly deny this, provided he is willing to think from reason, or to form conclusions from an understanding 
that is for a while enlightened. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8398</b></p><p><b>8398.</b>
'And all the assembly of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin' means arriving at another state of temptation. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming' as a point in the further stage 
that is meant in <a href="8397.htm">8397</a> by 'travelling on'; from the meaning of 'the assembly of the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="7843.htm">7843</a>; from the meaning of 'the wilderness' 
as a state when temptations have to be undergone, dealt with in <a href="8098.htm">8098</a>; and from the meaning of 'Sin' as the essential nature of the state since names hold within them the entire nature of the state 
of whatever thing they refer to, as has been shown in various places above. As temptation is meant by the grumbling over the lack of bread and flesh, and as the comfort received after that is meant 
by the manna and selav, the meaning of 'Sin' is clear, namely good that is the product of truth. In the contrary sense therefore 'Sin', a city in Egypt from which the wilderness of Sin took its name, 
means evil that is a product of falsity. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will pour out My wrath onto Sin, the strength of Egypt, and I will cut off the multitude of No; and I will send fire on Egypt. Sin will suffer 
great pain, and No will be breached, and Noph by enemies daily The young men of Aven and Pi Beseth will fall by the sword, and those [cities] will go away into captivity. And in Tehaphnehes the day 
will be darkened, when I break the yokes of Egypt there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2030:15-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 30:15-18</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The subject here is those in possession of known facts, who use them to hatch falsities that give rise to evils. 'Egypt' 
here is factual knowledge, 'Sin' is evil that arises from falsity, and 'No' is falsity that gives rise to evil. Anyone may recognize, solely from the consideration that it is the Divine Word, that a 
deeper meaning lies here than that visible in the letter. Without the deeper meaning within it, it would contain scarcely any intelligible meaning, never mind a meaning with a holy content. From this 
it is plainly evident that the names appearing in it are descriptive of real things, and that these provide a general meaning that befits the Word which comes from Jehovah. Anyone who accepts that the 
Word is Divine cannot possibly deny this, so long as he is willing to think rationally or to draw conclusions with an understanding that has been somewhat enlightened. </p>

`Et venerunt omnis coetus filiorum Israelis ad desertum Sin': quod significet ad statum alium tentationis, constat ex significatione `venire' quod sit statio successivi quod per `proficisci' n. (x)8397 
significatur, ex significatione `coetus filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 7843, ex significatione `deserti' quod sit status subeundi tentationes, de qua n. 8098, et 
ex significatione `Sin' quod sit quale illius status, nomina enim includunt omne quale status rei, de qua agitur, ut supra passim ostensum.  Ex tentatione {1} quae significatur per murmurationem propter 
defectum panis et carnis, et ex consolatione dein, quae significatur per `mannam' et `selav,' constare potest quid `Sin' significat, quod nempe bonum quod ex vero; inde Sin, quae urbs Aegypti a qua 
desertum Sin nomen accepit, in opposito sensu significat malum quod ex falso: apud Ezechielem, Effundam excandescentiam Meam super Sin robur Aegypti, et exscindam multitudinem No; et dabo ignem in 
Aegypto; dolendo dolebit Sin, et No erit ad perrumpendum, et Noph hostibus quotidie; juvenes Aven et (x)Pi-Beseth gladio cadent, et illae in captivitatem abibunt; et in (x)Thechapneches obtenebratus 
dies erit, quando fregero ibi juga Aegypti, xxx 15-18; </p>
<p>agitur hic de illis qui in scientificis sunt, et inde excludunt falsa ex 2 quibus mala; `Aegyptus' ibi est scientificum, `Sin' est malum quod ex 
falso, et `No' est falsum ex quo malum; quod altior hic sensus lateat quam qui in littera exstat, cuivis constare potest solum ex eo quod Verbum Divinum sit; nisi sensus (t)inibi altior, vix aliquis 
qui capi {2}potest foret, minus sensus in quo sanctum; inde patet manifeste quod nomina ibi sint res, et quod ex illis resultet sensus communis, qui Verbo, quod ex {3}Jehovah, dignus est; qui Verbum agnoscit 
Divinum, hoc nequaquam negare potest, modo velit ex ratione cogitare, {4}aut ex intellectu (x)aliquantisper illustrato concludere. 	@1 i illorum$ 	@2 possit$ 	@3 Divino$ 	@4 et$ </p>
