<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1635节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1635.</strong>当灵人和我说话时，我能清晰地听见并察觉他们的言语，和听世人之间的谈话一样。事实上，我与灵人交谈时，与世人在一起。我发现我能象听世人说话那样听见灵人说话，而且听得如此清楚，以致有时灵人奇怪，别人竟然听不见他们与我说话；因为就听觉而言，灵人与世人的言语完全没有区别。然而，进入听觉内在器官的流注不同于世人言语的流注，故只有我自己能听到。因为蒙主怜悯，我的内在器官已被打开。人类的言语凭借空气、通过外在途径经由耳朵进入，而灵人的言语则既不经由耳朵，也不凭借空气进入，而是通过内在途径进入头部或大脑相同的听觉器官。所以，听觉是一样的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1635.</strong> When spirits talked to me, I heard them as clearly and distinctly as the people I speak with on earth. In fact when I talked with spirits while surrounded by people, I noticed that I could hear the spirits just as audibly as the people 钬?so much so that the spirits sometimes had trouble believing they could not be heard by my companions. There was no difference whatever in the sound.<br />But since spirits' speech stimulates the ear's inner organs in a different way than conversation with other people does, it was inaudible to everyone but me, in whom those organs were open, by the Lord's divine mercy. Human speech enters through the ear along an external route, by means of the air. The speech of spirits enters not by the ear or the air but by an inner way. It reaches the same organs inside the head (in the brain), which is why it sounds the same. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1635</b></p><p><b>1635.</b>
The speech of spirits with me has been heard and perceived as distinctly as the speech of man with man; indeed, when I have spoken with them while I have been in company with men, I observed that just 
in the same way as I heard the men speaking sonorously, so also did I hear the spirits; insomuch that the spirits sometimes wondered that others did not hear what they said to me; for as regards the 
hearing there was absolutely no difference. But as the influx into the internal organs of hearing is different from that of speech with men, it could be heard only by myself; to whom of the Lord's Divine 
mercy these organs have been opened. Human speech passes in through the ear, by an external way, by means of the air; but the speech of spirits does not enter through the ear, nor by means of the 
air; but by an internal way, into the same organs of the head or brain. Consequently the hearing is the same. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1635</b></p><p><b>1635.</b>
When spirits have spoken to me I have heard and perceived their speech as clearly as that used by man speaking to man. Indeed when I have talked to spirits while I have been in the company of men, I 
have observed that just as the men's speech was audible to me so also was that of the spirits, so audible that sometimes the spirits were amazed that their speaking to me was not heard by others; for 
as far as hearing was concerned no difference at all existed between the speech of the spirits and that of the men. Yet because influx into the internal organs of hearing is not of the same kind as the 
influx of spoken words among men, those spirits could not be heard by anybody other than myself whose internal organs in the Lord's Divine mercy have been opened. Human speech is brought in through 
the ear by an external route, by means of the air, whereas the speech of spirits does not come in through the ear nor by means of the air but by an internal route, into the same organs of the head or 
brain. The hearing is consequently the same. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1635</b>
</p><b>1635.</b>
Loquela spirituum mecum tam distincte audita et percepta est sicut loquela cum homine; immo quando cum illis locutus sum in medio consortio hominum, tunc observatum quod sicut audiverim homines sonore, 
ita quoque spiritus, usque adeo ut quandoque mirati sint spiritus quod loquela eorum mecum non audita aliis; nam nulla prorsus differentia intercessit quoad auditum': sed quia influxus in organa auditus 
interna est alius quam est influxus sermonis cum hominibus, non potuit aliis audiri quam mihi cui, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, illa aperta fuerunt; sermo humanus illabitur per aurem, via externa, 
medio aere; sed sermo spirituum non per aurem nec medio aere, verum via interna, in eadem capitis seu cerebri organa; inde similis auditus. </p>
