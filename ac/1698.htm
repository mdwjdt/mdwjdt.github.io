<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1698节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1698.</strong>“又掳去亚伯兰的侄儿罗得和罗得的财物，离开了”表表面的良善与真理本身并非良善与真理，它们占据了外在人和那里的一切。这从“罗得”的含义清楚可知。前面已多次阐述和说明，罗得表主的感官人或外在人；事实上在此表外在人的表面良善与真理，也就是此处“罗得的财物”。在主的童年时期，这些良善与真理看似良善与真理，但就象前面所解释的，它们本身并不是。不过，这些良善与真理会通过试探的争战渐渐被净化，这从有关试探的论述清楚可知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1698.</strong> They took Lot and his property — the son of Abram's brother — and went away means that apparent goodness and truth (not good or true in itself) seized control of the Lord's outer self and everything in it. This can be seen from the symbolism of Lot as the Lord's sensory or outward self, a symbolism already mentioned and discussed several times [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428" target=_top>1428</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547" target=_top>1547</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563" target=_top>1563</a>]. Here specifically he symbolizes apparent goodness and truth in the Lord's outer self, which are being called the property of Lot. It has already been explained that this goodness and truth appeared good and true in the Lord's early youth, although they were not intrinsically so [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661" target=_top>1661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667" target=_top>1667</a>]. They were gradually purified, and his spiritual trials were the means, as the remarks concerning such trials show [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1652" target=_top>1652-1657</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659" target=_top>1659</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663" target=_top>1663-1664</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1692" target=_top>1692</a>]. </p>

And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his substance, and departed. That this signifies that the apparent goods and truths, which in themselves are not goods and truths, took possession of the 
external man, and of all things therein, is evident from the signification of "Lot." That "Lot" signifies the sensuous or external man in the Lord, has already been frequently stated and shown; but here 
by "Lot" is signified the external man in respect to the apparent goods and truths, which are Lot's "substance." That in the Lord's earliest childhood these goods and truths appeared to be goods and 
truths, but in themselves were not so, has been already explained; but that they were by degrees purified, and this in fact by means of the combats of temptations, may be seen from what has been said 
concerning temptations. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1698</b></p><p><b>1698.</b>
That 'they took Lot and his acquisitions, Abram's brother's son, and went their way' means that apparent goods and truths, which are not in themselves goods and truths, took possession of the External 
Man and everything there is clear from the meaning of 'Lot' who, as stated and shown frequently already, means the Lord's Sensory or External Man; indeed here he means the External Man as regards apparent 
goods and truths, which here are 'Lot's acquisitions'. That those goods and truths bore the appearance in early childhood of being goods and truths but were not in fact so has been explained already. 
But that those goods and truths were gradually purified, by means indeed of the conflicts that constitute temptations, becomes clear from what has been stated about temptations. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1698</b>
</p><b>1698.</b>
Quod 'sumpserunt Lotum, et acquisitionem ejus, filium fratris Abrami, et abiverunt' significet quod bona et vera apparentia, quae in se non bona et vera sunt, occupaverint Externum Hominem, et omnia 
quae ibi essent, constat a significatione Loti, qui quod significet apud Dominum, Sensualem seu Externum Hominem, prius aliquoties dictum et ostensum est, et quidem hic Externum Hominem quoad bona et 
vera apparentia, quae hic sunt 'acquisitio Loti'; quod bona et vera illa apparuerint ut bona et vera in prima pueritia, et non in se ita fuerint, prius explicatum est; sed quod per gradus purificata 
sint, et quidem per pugnas tentationum, ex illis quae de tentationibus dicta sunt, constare potest. </p>
