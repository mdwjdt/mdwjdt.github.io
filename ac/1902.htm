<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1902节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1902.</strong>“亚伯兰听从了撒莱的话”表这事无法用其它办法做到。这从内义的连贯性，以及人类理性只能以这种方式生出的必要性清楚可知。如果人没有充满遗传的邪恶，那么理性就会通过内在人的属天事物与其属灵事物的婚姻直接流入，认知的能力也会通过理性生出。其结果是，一来到这个世界，人立刻就拥有发育成熟的理智和认知能力，因为这一切都符合流注的次序。这一点可从以下事实推断出来，所有动物，无一例外生来就具有成熟的知道自己所需以及适合之物的能力；这种认知能力在寻找食物、获得安全、生活习性、繁衍后代方面是有帮助的，因为它们天生的本性符合次序。而人为何生来不具备同样的能力？原因在于，他里面的次序被破坏了，唯独人生来没有任何知识。<br />致使人生来没有任何知识的，是遗传自父母的邪恶。由于这种邪恶，他的一切能力被转向与善和真相对立的方向上，因而无法通过主的属天和属灵之物的直接流注转变成对应的形式。这就是为何人类理性必须以完全不同的方式或途径形成的原因，也就是说，它必须通过经由感官所引入的知识和认知，因而通过外在途径，以颠倒的次序形成。主以这种奇迹般的方式使人变得理性。这就是“和婢女同房”的含义，它表示内在人与外层人联结。而“亚伯兰听从了撒莱的话” 表这事无法用其它办法做到。<br />由于主和其他人一样出生，并拥有来自母亲的遗传，所以在奇迹般地通过知识形成理性方面，祂和其他人没什么两样。目的在于祂能通过试探的争战和胜利使万物恢复秩序，因此祂的理性也和其他人一样孕育和生出。然而，不同之处在于，祂的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，从至内在就具有神性或耶和华，因而具有对整个人类之爱的生命，因为祂在其一切试探中都是为了整个人类及其救赎而争战。</p>

And Abram harkened to the voice of Sarai. That this signifies that it could not be done in any other way, may be seen from the connection in the internal sense, and from the necessity that exists for 
the rational to be born in this way. If man were imbued with no hereditary evil, the rational would then be born immediately, from the marriage of the celestial things of the internal man with its spiritual 
things, and the faculty of knowing would be born through the rational, so that on coming into the world a man would at once have in himself all the faculty of reason and of knowing, for this would 
be in accordance with the order of influx, as may be inferred from the fact that all animals whatever are born into all the faculty of knowing that is necessary and helpful in securing food, safety, 
habitation, and procreation, because their nature is in accordance with order. Why then is man not born into it, except for the reason that order has been destroyed in him, for he alone is born into 
no knowledge?  [2] The cause of his being so born is evil inherited from his father and mother. By reason of this all his faculties are turned in a contrary direction in regard to truths and goods, 
and therefore cannot be reduced into correspondent forms by the immediate influx of what is celestial and spiritual from the Lord. This is the reason why man's rational must be formed by an altogether 
different process, that is, in a different way, namely, by means of knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones] introduced through the senses, thus flowing in by an external way, and so in inverted order. 
Man is thus made rational by the Lord in a miraculous manner. This is meant by "going in unto the handmaid," by which is signified the conjunction of the internal man with the exterior man; and also 
by "Abram's hearkening to the voice of Sarai," which signifies that it could not be done in any other way.  [3] The Lord, being born as are other men, and because He had a nature inherited from the 
mother, was like other men also in respect to the miraculous formation of the rational by means of knowledges, to the end that by combats of temptations and by victories He might reduce all things into 
order. Therefore was His rational conceived and born in the same way as with other men, but with the difference that inmostly in all things that were His, in both general and particular, there was 
the Divine, or Jehovah, and thus the life of love toward the whole human race, for whom and for whose salvation He fought in all His temptations. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1902</b></p><p><b>1902.</b>
'And Abram hearkened to Sarai's voice' means it could not have been achieved in any other way. This becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal sense and from the necessity that the human 
rational can be born in this and no other way. If man were not steeped in any hereditary evil, the rational would be born straightaway from the marriage of the celestial things belonging to the internal 
man with the spiritual things belonging to the same; and through the rational the faculty of knowing would be born. This would mean that on entering the world a person would possess straightaway within 
himself fully-formed faculties of reason and of knowing, for this would all be in accordance with the order that belongs to influx. This may be deduced from the fact that all animals without exception 
are born into a fully-formed faculty of knowing what they need and what is suitable for them in the way of food, safety, habitat, and producing offspring, because their inborn nature is in accordance 
with order. For what other reason is man born without the same faculties than that in his case order has been destroyed - for he alone is born without any knowledge?  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That which causes him 
to be born without any knowledge is hereditary evil received from his father and from his mother. Because of that evil all his faculties are turned in a contrary direction insofar as goods and truths 
are concerned, so that the latter are not able through an immediate influx of celestial and spiritual things from the Lord to be translated into correspondent forms. This is the reason why man's rational 
has to be formed in an entirely different manner or way, that is to say, by means of facts and cognitions entering in through the senses, and so by the external route, thus by what is a reversal 
of order. In this way, miraculously so, a person is made rational by the Lord. This is described by 'going in to the servant-girl', which means the joining of the internal man to the exterior man, and 
by the statement that 'Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai', which means that it could not have been achieved in any other way. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because the Lord was born as any other is born and had a heredity 
from the mother, He was like any other in this respect also, the purpose being that through the conflicts brought about by temptations and through victories He might restore all things to order. 
His Rational as well therefore was conceived and born as it is with any other, yet with the difference that the Divine, or Jehovah - and so the life belonging to love towards the whole human race, on 
whose behalf and for whose salvation He fought in all His temptations - resided in every single thing that was His inmostly. </p>

`Et auscultavit Abram voci Sarai': quod significet non aliter fieri potuisse, constare potest a serie rerum in sensu interno et e necessitate quod rationale apud hominem non aliter nasci possit.  Si 
homo nullo hereditario malo imbutus esset, tunc nasceretur rationale immediate ex conjugio caelestium interni hominis cum spiritualibus ejus, et per rationale nasceretur scientificum, sic ut homo omni 
rationale et omne scientificum ilico dum venit in mundum, secum haberet; hoc enim foret secundum ordinem influxus; quod concludi potest ex eo quod omnia animalia quaecumque sunt, nascantur in omne scientificum 
quod illis ad victum eorum, tutelam, habitatione' et procreationem necessarium est et conducit, quia eorum natura e secundum ordinem.  Quod non homo, nisi apud eum ordo foret destructus, nam 
solus in nullam scientiam nascitur?  [2] Quod facit ut ita nascatur, est malum hereditarium a patre et matre, inde omnes ejus facultates sunt in contrario versu respective ad vera et bona, quae formas 
correspondentes redigi nequeunt per influxum immediatum caelestium et spiritualium a Domino; quae causa est quod alio prorsus modo seu alia via formandum sit rationale hominis, nempe per scientifica 
et cognitiones insinuata per sensus, ita influentia per via: externam, sic {1} ordine inverso; homo sic miraculose a Domino rationalis fit; hoc intelligitur per `ingredi ad ancillam,' quo significatur 
conjunctio interni hominis cum exteriore et per quod `Abram auscultavit voci Sarai,' quo significatur quod non aliter fieri potuisset.  [3] Dominus quia natus sicut alius homo et a matre hereditarium 
habuit, similis alii homini in hoc fuit, ob causam ut per pugnas tentationum et victorias redigeret omnia in ordinem; ideo etiam {2} Rationale Ipsius similiter conceptum et natum fuit ac apud alium 
hominem, cum differentia quod Divinum seu Jehovah fuit in omnibus et singulis Ipsius intime, ita vita amoris erga universum genus humanum, pro quo et cujus {3} salvatione in omnibus suis tentationibus 
pugnavit. 	@1 ita.$ 	@2 quoque.$ 	@3 ejus.$ </p>
