<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9001节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9001.</strong>“就当照女儿的规矩待她”表它将如同对真理的纯正情感一般。这从“照规矩”和“女儿”的含义清楚可知：“照规矩”是指具有同样的权利，因为“规矩（judgment，即典章）”表示诸如存在于代表性教会所在文明状态下的一种外在真理或一种权利（<a href="8972.htm">8972</a>节）；“女儿”是指对真理的情感（<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>节），在此是指对真理的纯正情感，因为“婢女”表示源于属世快乐的对真理的情感（<a href="8993.htm">8993</a>节），因而是一种不纯正的情感，直到她要么与她的主人，要么与主人的儿子订婚。但当她订婚时，也就是当这种情感与“主人”和“儿子”所表示的属灵真理结合时，它就变得像一种纯正的情感；因为这时，属世层已经服从于属灵真理，当它服从时，就不再被自己引导，而是被它所服从的属灵真理引导。正因如此，属世层变得像属灵层，因为它与属灵层行如一体；而且这时属灵真理所拥有的生命进入属世层，并赋予它生命。但与婢女的订婚或结合不同于与一个女儿的结合，因为后一种结合发生在内在人中，而前一种结合发生在外在人中。</p>

He shall do to her according to the judgment of daughters. That this signifies that it shall be as is the genuine affection of truth, is evident from the signification of "according to the judgment," 
as being with the same right; for by the "judgment" is signified external truth or right such as is in the civil state in which is the representative church (n. 8972); and from the signification of "daughter," 
as being the affection of truth (n. 2362, 3024, 3963), here the genuine affection of truth, because by "the maidservant" is signified the affection of truth from natural delight (n. 8993), 
thus not genuine until she has been betrothed either to her master, or to his son. But when she has been betrothed, that is, when this affection has been conjoined with the spiritual truth which is signified 
by "master," and by "son," then it becomes as it were genuine, for then the natural has been subordinated to spiritual truth, and when it has been subordinated it is no longer in its own right, 
but in that of the spiritual truth under which it has been subordinated; consequently the natural becomes as the spiritual, because it acts as a one with it. And then also the life of spiritual truth 
is transferred into the natural, and vivifies it. But betrothal, or conjunction, with a maidservant, differs from conjunction with a daughter in the fact that the latter conjunction is effected in the 
interior man, but the former in the external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9001</b></p><p><b>9001.</b>
'He shall deal with her according to the judgement of daughters' means that it will then be like a genuine affection for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'according to the judgement' as with 
the same rights, for 'the judgement' means an external truth or a right such as exists in a civic state where the Church is representative, dealt with in <a href="8972.htm">8972</a>; and from the meaning of 'daughter' as an 
affection for truth, dealt with in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>, at this point a genuine affection for truth, since 'a female slave' means an affection for truth springing from natural delight, <a href="8993.htm">8993</a>, and so an affection 
that is not genuine until betrothed either to master or to son. But when it has been betrothed, that is, joined to spiritual truth, meant by master and by son, it comes to be like a genuine affection; 
for then the natural is subordinated to spiritual truth, and when subordinated it is directed no longer by itself but by the spiritual truth under which it is subordinated. So it is that the 
natural comes to be like the spiritual, since it acts in unison with it; and also the life that spiritual truth possesses passes then into the natural and gives it life But being betrothed or joined 
to a female slave is different from being joined to a daughter, in that the latter joining together takes place in the internal man but the former in the external man. </p>

`Secundum judicium filiarum faciet ei': quod significet quod sicut affectio veri genuina erit, constat ex significatione `secundum judicium' quod sit simili jure, per `judicium' enim significatur verum 
externum seu jus quale in statu civili ubi Ecclesia repraesentativa, {1} n. 8972, et ex significatione `filiae' quod sit affectio veri, de qua n. 2362, 3024, 3963, hic affectio veri genuina, nam per 
`ancillam' significatur affectio veri ex jucundo naturali, n. 8993, ita non genuina antequam desponsata est vel domino vel filio; {2}sed cum desponsata est, hoc est, conjuncta vero spirituali, quod 
per `dominum' et per `filium' significatur, tunc fit sicut genuina, nam tunc subordinatum est naturale vero spirituali, et cum subordinatum est, non amplius est sui juris sed veri spiritualis sub quo 
subordinatum est; inde fit naturale sicut spirituale, quia unum cum hoc agit; etiam vita veri spiritualis transfertur tunc in naturale, et hoc vivificat; sed desponsatio seu conjunctio cum ancilla differt 
a conjunctione cum filia in eo quod haec conjunctio fiat in interiore homine, illa autem in externo. @1 i de qua$ @2 quod affectio haec fiat sicut genuina cum conjuncta est vero spirituali, quod 
per dominum et per filium significatur, est, quia tunc subordinata est vero spirituali, et cum naturale subordinatum est vero spirituali, tunc non amplius est sui juris sed veri spiritualis sub quo 
subordinatum$ </p>
