<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8700节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8700.</strong>“因为这事对你太重”表这事是不可能的，因为它不符合真正的秩序。这从“这事太重”的含义清楚可知，“这事太重”是指这事是不可能的。“这事太重”在此表示这事是不可能的，这一点从前文明显看出来，即“他和这跟他在一起的百姓，都必疲惫”，以此表示已被植入的真理就会灭亡；这一点也可从下文明显看出来，即“你独自一人做不了”，以及后来“你若行这事，你就能站得住”，以此表示若不作出改变，是不可能的。<br />这事是不可能的，因为它不符合真正的秩序；其原因在于，在来世，凡符合秩序的事都是可能的，凡不符合秩序的事都是不可能的。从主发出的神性真理才是那构成秩序，并且是秩序本身的。因此，凡符合神性真理的，都符合秩序，是可能的；凡违反神性真理的，都违反秩序，是不可能的。举几个例子有助于清楚说明这是真的。按照秩序，过着良善生活的人会得救，过着邪恶生活的人会被定罪。因此，过着良善生活的人被送入地狱，过着邪恶生活的人被提入天堂是不可能的。地狱里的人蒙主的纯粹怜悯从地狱被带到天堂并得救也是不可能的。因为拯救每个人的，是他们活在世上时对主怜悯的接受。那些在世上接受它的人在来世向主的怜悯敞开，，因为在那里他们拥有接受它的能力。把它赋予其他人，并且随意赋予所有人，只要他们有信，进而相信他们已经从罪中洁净，是不可能的，因为这违反真正的秩序，也就是违反作为秩序的神性。<br />按照秩序，信与仁在自由中，而非强迫之下被植入；在自由中被植入的信与仁能持久，但它们若在强迫之下被植入，则不持久。原因在于，当它们在自由中被植入时，或说凡在自由中所行的，都被灌输到人的情感中，从而被灌输到他的意愿中，由此变成他自己的；但它们若在强迫之下被植入，或说凡在强迫之下所行的，则不会。因此，人得救是不可能的，除非他因生在恶中，故可以自由地作恶或不作恶。当他在这种自由中自动停止邪恶时，对真理和良善的情感就被灌输进来，这赋予他接受属于信和仁的洞察力，因为自由属于情感。由此明显可知，一个人在强迫之下是不可能得救的；如果这是可能的，那么世界上所有人都会得救。<br />按照秩序，在来世，所有人都照着他们在世上为自己所获得的生活而形成不同的社群；恶人与恶人在一起生活，善人与善人在一起生活。因此，恶人与善人在一起是不可能的；陷入邪恶的人处于良善也是不可能的，因为良善与邪恶是对立面，一个毁灭另一个。由此也明显可知，地狱里的人是不可能得救的；因此，单凭怜悯得救，无论一个人过着怎样的生活，是不可能的。那些在地狱备受折磨的人将那里的折磨归因于神性，说神性若愿意，就能拿走他们所受的折磨，因为祂是全能的；但祂不愿意，所以祂是他们所受折磨的原因或说为此负责。他们说，凡有能力却不愿意的人就是原因，或说要为此负责。但拿走这些折磨是不可能的，因为这违反秩序。事实上，如果它们真的被拿走，恶人就会起来攻击善人，还会征服天使本身并摧毁天堂。但神性只意愿良善，即意愿善人的幸福，想要这些折磨，仅仅因为它们能约束，同时纠正恶人。由于这就是目的，是神性之爱和怜悯本身的目的，所以拿走地狱里的人所受的折磨是不可能的。从这些例子可以看出，违反秩序的一切事都是不可能的，无论对那些不知道天堂奥秘的人来说，它看似多么有可能。</p>

For the word is too heavy for thee. That this signifies that it is not possible because not in conformity with order, is evident from the signification of "a heavy word," as being that it is not possible. 
That "a heavy word" here denotes that it is not possible, is evident from what precedes, namely, that "wearing he would wear away, and the people that were with him," by which is signified that 
the truth which has been implanted would perish; and also from what follows, namely, "Thou art not able to do it, thou alone;" and afterward, "If thou do this word, thou shalt be able to stand;" by which 
is meant impossibility unless a change is made. [2] That it is not possible because not in conformity with order, is because in the other life everything is possible that is in conformity with order. 
The Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord is what makes order, and is order itself. Consequently as everything that is according to Divine truth is according to order, it is possible; and as 
everything that is contrary to Divine truth is contrary to order, it is impossible. That this is the case may appear more evident from examples. It is according to order that they who have lived well 
shall be saved, and that they who have lived ill shall be condemned. Hence it is impossible that they who have lived well should be sent into hell, and that they who have lived ill should be raised into 
heaven. Consequently it is impossible that they who are in hell can of the Lord's pure mercy be brought out therefrom into heaven and be saved; for it is the reception of the Lord's mercy while they 
lived in the world through which everyone is saved. They who receive it then are in the other life in the Lord's mercy, for they are then in the capacity of receiving it there. To give it to others, 
and in general to everyone at pleasure, provided they have faith, and thus believe that they are cleansed from sins, is impossible, because it is contrary to order, that is, contrary to the Divine which 
is order. [3] It is according to order that faith and charity be implanted in freedom and not under compulsion, and that the faith and charity which have been implanted in freedom, endure; but not 
if they have been implanted under compulsion. The reason is that what is done in freedom is insinuated into the affection, and thus into the will of man, and is therefore appropriated; but not what 
is done under compulsion. Consequently it is impossible for man to be saved unless, seeing that he has been born in evil, he is allowed to do evil, and to desist from evil. When in this freedom he desists 
from evil of himself, the affection of truth and good is insinuated by the Lord, whereby he has freedom to receive the things which are of faith and charity, for freedom belongs to the affection. 
From this it is plain that it is impossible to compel man to salvation. If this could be done, all men in the world would be saved. [4] It is according to order for all in the other life to be associated 
together according to the life which they have acquired to themselves in the world; the evil with the evil, and the good with the good. Consequently it is not possible for the evil and the good 
to be together; neither is it possible for those to be in good who are evil, because good and evil are opposites, and the one destroys the other. For this reason also it is plain that it is not possible 
for those to be saved who are in hell; thus that it is not possible for salvation to be from mercy alone however a man has lived. They who are in hell and are there tormented, impute the torments there 
to the Divine, saying that the Divine can take away their torment if He will, because He is omnipotent; but that He will not, and that therefore He is the cause of their torment; for he who can and 
will not, they say, is the cause. But to take away such torments is impossible, because it is contrary to order; for if they were taken away, the evil would rise up against the good, and would subjugate 
the angels themselves, and destroy heaven. But the Divine wills nothing but good, namely, the happiness of the good, and for the sake of this, the bridling, and at the same time, the amendment, 
of the wicked. This being the end-the end of the Divine love and of mercy itself-it is not possible that torments should be taken away from him who is in hell. From these examples it can be seen that 
everything is impossible which is contrary to order, howsoever it may appear as possible to those who do not know the arcana of heaven. </p>

'For the task is too heavy for you' means that it is not possible because it does not arise from true order. This is clear from the meaning of 'heavy task' as something not possible. The meaning of 'heavy 
burden' here as something not possible is clear from what comes before, where it says that he and the people with him would wither away, meaning that the truth which had been implanted was going 
to perish, and also from what comes after - 'You are not able to do it yourself alone', and later on in verse 23, 'If you do this thing, you are able to stand fast' - by which impossibility if no change 
takes place is meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why it is not possible because it does not arise from true order is that in the next life everything is possible which arises from order, and everything is 
impossible which does not arise from order. Divine Truth, which emanates from the Lord, is what makes order, indeed is order. Consequently everything that is in keeping with Divine Truth, being in keeping 
with order, is possible; and everything that is contrary to Divine Truth, being contrary to order, is impossible. Let some examples serve to show plainly that this is so. It is in keeping with order 
that people who have led good lives will be saved, and those who have led bad ones will be condemned. Therefore it is impossible to send to hell those who have led good lives, or to raise to heaven 
those who have led bad ones. Consequently it is impossible for those in hell to be brought, by the Lord's pure mercy, out of there into heaven and to be saved. For it is the acceptance of the Lord's 
mercy when they lived in the world that saves everyone. Those who accept it in the world are open to the Lord's mercy in the next life, for there they have the ability to accept it. Imparting it to others, 
and doing so at will to all and sundry provided that they possess faith and so believe they have been cleansed from sins, is impossible because it is contrary to true order, that is, contrary to 
the Divine, who is order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is in keeping with order that faith and charity should be implanted in freedom and not under compulsion, and that faith and charity that has been implanted in freedom 
should remain, but not if implanted under compulsion. The reason for this is that when they are implanted in freedom they are instilled into the person's affection and so into his will, and are accordingly 
made his own, but not so if they are implanted under compulsion. Consequently it is impossible for a person to be saved unless, having been born in evil, he is left in freedom to do evil or 
to refrain from it. When with that freedom he refrains of his own accord from evil, an affection for truth and goodness is instilled by the Lord; and this gives him freedom to receive insights belonging 
to faith and desires belonging to charity; for freedom exists as a result of affection. From this it is evident that it is impossible for a person to be saved under compulsion; were it possible all 
people in the world would be saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is in keeping with order in the next life for all to be formed into different communities according to the life they acquired in the world, the evil living 
in association with the evil, and the good with the good. It is not possible therefore for the evil and the good to be together, nor is it possible for the evil to be governed by good; for good and 
evil are opposites and one destroys the other. From this it is also evident that it is not possible for those in hell to be saved, so that salvation by mercy alone, regardless of the life a person has 
been leading, is an impossibility. Those who are in hell and suffer torment there attribute the torments there to the Divine. They say that since the Divine is all-powerful He is able, if He is willing, 
to take their torment away, but that He is not willing, and that for this reason He is responsible for it. For they say that he who is able yet unwilling to take it away is the one who is responsible 
for it. But it is impossible for such things to be taken away because that is contrary to order. If they were taken away the evil would rise up against the good; they would overpower the angels 
themselves and destroy heaven. But the Divine desires only what is good, that is to say, the happiness of those who are good, and those torments only because they restrain and at the same time correct 
the wicked. Since this is the end in view, being the end that Divine Love and Mercy itself has in view, it is not possible for the torments suffered by those in hell to be taken away. From these examples 
it becomes clear that everything is impossible which is contrary to order, however possible it may seem to be to those unacquainted with the arcana of heaven. </p>

`Quia grave prae te verbum': quod significet quod non possibile, {1}quia non ex ordine, constat ex significatione `grave verbum' quod sit non possibile; quod `grave verbum' hic sit non possibile, constat 
ex illis quae praecedunt, quod marcescendo marcesceret ille et populus qui cum illo, per quae significatur quod periturum verum quod inseminatum est, et quoque ex sequentibus, `Non potes facere 
illud solus tu' et dein `si verbum hoc facis, potes consistere' vers. 23, per quae intelligitur impossibilitas, si non fiat mutatio. 	2 Quod non possibile quia non ex ordine, est quia in altera vita 
omne id possibile est quod ex ordine, et omne id impossibile quod non ex ordine; Divinum Verum, quod procedit a Domino, est quod facit ordinem, et est ipse ordo; inde omne quod secundum {2}Divinum Verum 
est, quia est secundum {3}ordinem, est possibile, et omne quod contra {4}Divinum Verum, quia est contra {3}ordinem, est impossibile; quod ita sit, evidentius patere (x)potest ab exemplis: secundum 
ordinem est quod salventur qui bene vixerunt, et condemnentur qui male; inde impossibile est quod qui bene vixerunt mittantur in infernum, et qui male vixerunt eleventur in caelum; consequenter quod impossibile 
sit ut qui in inferno sunt, ex pura Misericordia Domini possint inde in caelum educi et salvari; est enim receptio Misericordiae Domini, cum vixerunt in mundo, per quam unusquisque salvatur; 
qui tunc recipiunt illam, in altera vita in Misericordia Domini sunt, nam ibi tunc in facultate recipiendi illam sunt; `illam dare aliis, et in genere unicuivis ex beneplacito, modo fidem habeant, et 
sic a peccatis mundatos esse credant, est impossibile, quia est contra ordinem, hoc est, contra Divinum quod est ordo. 	3 Secundum ordinem est quod fides et charitas implantentur in libero et non in 
coacto, et quod fides et charitas quae in libero implantatae sunt permaneant, non autem quae in coacto; causa est quia quae in libero, ea in affectionem ac ita in voluntatem hominis insinuantur et sic 
appropriantur, non autem quae in coacto; consequenter impossibile est ut salvetur homo nisi liceat ei, quia in malo natus est, malum facere et a malo desistere; cum a malo ex se in libero illo desistit, 
tunc insinuatur affectio veri et boni a Domino, {5}inde ei est liberum recipiendi illa quae fidei et quae charitatis sunt, nam liberum est affectionis {6}; inde patet quod impossibile sit cogere 
hominem ad salutem; quod si fieri posset, omnes qui in mundo sunt homines salvarentur. 	4 Secundum ordinem est ut in altera vita consocientur omnes secundum vitam quam in mundo sibi acquisiverunt, mali 
cum malis et boni cum bonis, inde non possibile est ut simul sint mali et boni; nec possibile est ut in bono sint qui mali, nam bonum et malum opposita sunt, et unum {7}destruit alterum; inde etiam 
patet quod non possibile sit ut salventur qui in inferno; ita non dabile quod salvatio, utcumque vixerat homo, sit ex sola misericordia.  Qui in inferno sunt, et ibi cruciantur, imputant Divino {8}cruciatus 
ibi, dicendo quod Divinum id auferre possit si velit, quia omnipotens, sed quod non velit, {9}et quod inde sit in causa, {10}nam qui potest et non vult, dicunt in causa esse; sed auferre talia 
impossibile est, quia est contra ordinem, si enim auferrentur, insurgerent mali contra bonos, (c)et subjugarent ipsos angelos, et destruerent caelum; sed Divinum non vult nisi bonum, nempe felicitatem 
bonorum, et ea propter refrenationem (c)ac simul emendationem improborum; cum hic finis est, qui est finis Divini Amoris ac ipsius Misericordiae, non possibile est ut cruciatus (x)illis qui in inferno 
auferantur.  Ex his exemplis constare potest quod omne id non possibile sit quod contra ordinem, utcumque apparet ut possibile illis qui arcana caeli non sciunt. 	@1 quod IT$ 	@2 ordinem$ 	@3 Divinum$ 	@4
