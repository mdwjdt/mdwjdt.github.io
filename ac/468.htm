<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（三）内义</h4><br /><strong>468.</strong>从前章所述明显可知，名字表异端邪说。由此可见，本章中的名字不是指人，而是指事物。在此，它们表示教义体系或教会，虽历经改变，但仍从上古教会时期被保存到“挪亚”时代。不过，随着时间流逝，每个教会都渐渐缩小，最终存留在少数人中。在大洪水时期，保留教会的这少数人被称为“挪亚”。<br />②这真教会不断缩小，最终存留在少数人中，这一点从也是这样衰退的其它教会明显可知。剩下的这些人在圣言中被称为“余留”和”余民”，被说成是“在地当中（或在当中）”的。适用于总体的也适用于个体；即适用于教会的，同样适用于个人。若非主保存每个人的“余留”，人必在永死中灭亡，因为属灵和属天的生命就在这些“余留”中。这同样适用于总体或普遍的事物，若不是总有一些人保有教会或真信，人类将会灭亡。众所周知，一座城，甚至整个王国因几个人的缘故被拯救。在这方面，教会的情形如同人体，只要心脏健康，周边脏俯就有可能继续存活，但心脏衰弱时，身体的其它部位就得不到滋养，人就会死亡。最后的“余留”就是“挪亚”所表示的那些人，因为从创世记6:12，以及其它经文可以看出，全地都败坏了。<br />③至于存在于每一个体，以及总体上教会里面的“余留”，先知书中有大量阐述，如在以赛亚书：<br />那时，剩在锡安、留在耶路撒冷的，就是一切住耶路撒冷、在生命册上记名的，必称为圣；主将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷中杀人的血除净。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.3.htm">4:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.4.htm">4</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“圣”被归于“余民”，以此表示教会的余留，也表示教会成员的余留，因为剩在锡安、留在耶路撒冷的人被称为圣，不仅仅因为他们留在那里。又如：<br />到那日，以色列所剩下的和雅各家所逃脱的，不再倚靠那击打他们的，却要诚实倚靠耶和华以色列的圣者。那些余民，就是雅各家所剩下的，必归于大能的神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.20.htm">10:20</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />到那些日子，那时候，虽寻以色列的罪孽，一无所有；虽寻犹太的罪恶，也无所见；因我所留下的人，我必赫免。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.20.htm">50:20</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />雅各余留的人必在多国的民中，如从耶和会那里降下的露水，又如甘露降在草上。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.7.htm">5:7</a>）<br />④人或教会的余留或余留也用“十分之一”这一神圣的数字来表示。因此涉及“十”的数字也是神圣的，所以“十”用来指那些余留。如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华将人迁到远方，在这地当中有许多遗弃的地方；然而将有十分之一在其中，这将归回；它将像一棵栗树或橡树虽被砍伐，树墩子却仍存留；神圣的种子就是它的树墩子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.12.htm">6:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />在此，存留被称为“神圣的种子”。阿摩司书：<br />“主耶和华如此说，这城发出一千，必有一百留下；发出一百，必有十个留给以色列家。”（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.3.htm">5:3</a>）<br />这些以及其它众多经文在内义上指的就是我们所说的“余留”。城因教会余民的缘故被保存，这一点从神对亚伯拉罕所说关于所多玛的话明显可知：<br />亚伯拉罕说：“假如在那里找到十个呢？”祂回答说:“我因这十个的缘故，也不毁灭那城”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.32.htm">18:32</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]468.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />WHAT was stated and demonstrated in the last chapter shows that names symbolize heresies and doctrines,{*1} and this in turn suggests that the names in the present chapter stand not for individuals but for some larger entity. Here they symbolize the doctrines — the churches — that were preserved (despite undergoing changes) from the time of the earliest church up to Noah.<br />A church tends to dwindle over time, however, until at last it remains with only a few. The few among whom it remained at the time of the Flood were called Noah.<br />[2] The waning of the true church until it remains with a few can be seen from other churches that likewise shrank. The remaining few are called "survivors" or "a remnant" in the Word, where they are described as being in the middle or heart of the land.{*2} The situation is the same in general as it is in particular; in other words, what holds true for the church holds true for individual people. Unless the Lord preserved a remnant in each of us, we could only succumb to eternal death, because the remnant holds spiritual and heavenly life within it.{*3} Likewise at the general or universal level, unless there were always some with whom the church or true faith survived, the human race would come to an end. For the sake of a handful, we know, the city and in fact the whole nation is preserved.{*4} This is mirrored in the human heart. As long as the heart is healthy, the surrounding organs thrive. When it ails, all the organs deteriorate and the person dies.<br />The last survivors, [or remnants,] are what Noah symbolizes, since aside from him the whole earth was corrupt, as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_12" target=_top>Genesis 6:12</a> makes clear.<br />[3] Remaining traces in each individual and in the church are discussed by the prophets in many places, as in Isaiah:<br />The one left in Zion and the one remaining in Jerusalem will be called holy to him — everyone in Jerusalem assigned to life — when the Lord has cleansed the filth of Zion's daughters and washed away the blood of Jerusalem from its midst. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_4_3-4" target=_top>Isaiah 4:3-4</a>)<br />What is left — symbolizing the survivors of the church and the remnant in the people of the church — is here described as being holy. After all, those left in Zion and Jerusalem could not have been holy just because they were left there. Likewise in the same author:<br />It will be in that day that the survivors of Israel and the refugees of Jacob's house will no longer continue to lean on the one that strikes them; and it will lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truthfulness. The survivors will return, the survivors of Jacob, to the mighty God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_20-21" target=_top>Isaiah 10:20-21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_22" target=_top>22</a>)<br />In Jeremiah:<br />In those days and at that time there will be a search for Israel's wickedness, but it will not be there, and for Judah's sins, and they will not be found, because I will pardon the one whom I make a remainder. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_50_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 50:20</a>)<br />In Micah:<br />The survivors of Jacob in the midst of many peoples will be like dew from Jehovah, like showers on the grass. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_micah_5_7" target=_top>Micah 5:7</a>)<br />[4] The remainder or remnant in a person or in the church was also represented by tithes, or portions equaling one tenth, which were holy. As a result, the number ten was also holy, and this is why ten is associated with remnants, as it is in Isaiah:<br />Jehovah will take humankind away, but a great [portion] will be left in the middle of the land. And a tenth will remain there and return but is destined for expulsion, like an oak or a holm oak when its stump is cast out. Its stump is holy seed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_12-13" target=_top>Isaiah 6:12-13</a>)<br />Here the remainder is called a holy stump. In Amos:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said: "The city going out as a thousand will leave one hundred remaining, and the one going out as a hundred will leave ten remaining to the house of Israel." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_3" target=_top>Amos 5:3</a>)<br />These places and many others in their inner meaning symbolize and describe a remnant. The fact that a city is preserved for the sake of the church's survivors can be seen from what Abraham said of Sodom:<br />Abraham said, "Perhaps ten may be found there." And [Jehovah] said, "I will not destroy it for the sake of ten." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/bible_king-james-version_genesis_18_32" target=_top>Genesis 18:32</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On names that stand for heresies and doctrines, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324" target=_top>324-325</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_331" target=_top>331-336</a>.

THE INTERNAL SENSE. From what has been said and shown in the foregoing chapter, it is evident that by names are signified heresies and doctrines. Hence it may be seen that by the names in this chapter 
are not meant persons, but things, and in the present instance doctrines, or churches, which were preserved, notwithstanding the changes they underwent, from the time of the Most Ancient Church even 
to "Noah." But the case with every church is that in course of time it decreases, and at last remains among a few; and the few with whom it remained at the time of the flood were called "Noah." [2] 
That the true church decreases and remains with but few, is evident from other churches which have thus decreased. Those who are left are in the Word called "remains" and a "remnant" and are said to 
be "in the midst" or "middle" "of the land." And as this is the case in the universal, so also it is in the particular, or as it is with the church, so it is with every individual man; for unless remains 
were preserved by the Lord in everyone, he must needs perish eternally, since spiritual and celestial life are in the remains. So also in the general or universal-if there were not always some with 
whom the church, or true faith, remained, the human race would perish; for, as is generally known, a city, nay, sometimes a whole kingdom, is saved for the sake of a few. It is in this respect with 
the church as it is with the human body; so long as the heart is sound, life is possible for the neighboring viscera, but when the heart is enfeebled, the other parts of the body cease to be nourished, 
and the man dies. The last remains are those which are signified by "Noah;" for (as appears from Gen. 6:12,  as well as from other places) the whole earth had become corrupt.  [3] Of remains as existing 
in each individual as well as in the church in general, much is said in the Prophets; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy to Him, 
even everyone that is written unto lives in Jerusalem, when the Lord shall have washed the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have washed away the bloods of Jerusalem from the midst thereof (Isa. 
4:3-4), in which passage holiness is predicated of the remains, by which are signified the remains of the church, and also of a man of the church; for "those left" in Zion and Jerusalem could not 
be holy merely because they were "left." Again: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day, that the remains of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him 
that smote them, but shall stay upon Jehovah the Holy One of Israel in truth. The remains shall return, the remains of Jacob, unto the mighty God (Isa. 10:20-21). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     In those days, and 
in that time, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will pardon him whom I shall make a remnant (Jer. 50:20). In 
Micah: </p>
<p>     The remains of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, as the dew from Jehovah, as the showers upon the grass (Micah 5:7).[4] The residue or remains of a man, or of the church, 
were also represented by the tenths, which were holy; hence also a number with ten in it was holy, and "ten" is therefore predicated of remains; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall remove man, and many 
things [shall be] left in the midst of the land; and yet in it [shall be] a tenth part, and it shall return, and shall be for exterminating; as an oak, and an ilex, when the stock is cast forth from them, 
the holy seed is the stock thereof (Isa. 6:12-13); </p>
<p>where the residue is called a "seed of holiness." And in Amos: </p>
<p>     Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, The city that goeth forth a thousand shall have 
a hundred left, and that which goeth forth a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel (Amos 5:3). In these and many other passages, in the internal sense are signified the "remains" of which 
we have been speaking. That a city is preserved for the sake of the remains of the church, is evident from what was said to Abraham concerning Sodom: </p>
<p>     Abraham said, Peradventure ten may be found 
there; and He said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake (Gen. 18:32). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 468</b></p><p><b>468.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE  It is clear from what was stated and shown in the previous chapter that names meant heresies and systems of doctrine. From that it becomes clear that the names in this chapter do 
not mean specific individuals but other things that existed. Here they mean systems of doctrine or Churches which, though they underwent certain changes, were preserved from the time of the Most Ancient 
Church down to that of Noah. Now it so happens that every Church in the course of time gets smaller until at length it remains among only a few people. The few with whom it remained at the time of 
the Flood were called Noah.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the true Church gets smaller and remains among the few becomes clear from other Churches which have in a similar manner got smaller. In the Word those 
who remain are called 'the Remnant' and 'that which is left', and indeed people 'in the midst (or the middle) of the land'. What applies in general applies in particular also; that is, what is true 
of the Church is equally true of individuals. If the Lord did not preserve remnants with each individual he would inevitably perish in eternal death, for those remnants contain spiritual and celestial 
life. The same applies to what is general or universal; were there not always some people among whom the Church, or true faith, existed, the human race would perish. For as is well known, a city, even 
a whole kingdom, is preserved for the sake of a few. These factors are akin to the heart in man: as long as the heart is sound the surrounding organs can go on living. But when it is weak, deterioration 
sets into them all and the person dies. Final remnants are meant by Noah, for with the exception of these, as is clear from verse 12 of the next chapter, 'the whole earth was corrupt'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The 
remnants residing with the individual or within the Church are frequently the subject in the Prophets, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who remains in Zion, and he who is left in Jerusalem will be called holy to 
Him, everyone who has been written for life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in Jerusalem, when the Lord will have washed the filth of the daughters of Zion and washed away the blood<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of Jerusalem from its midst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%204:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 4:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
holiness is attributed to the remnants, which mean remnants of the Church, and also of the member of the Church, for those left in Zion and in Jerusalem could not be holy people merely because they 
had been left there. Similarly in the same prophet,  </p>
<p>On that day, the remnant of Israel and those of the house of Jacob that escaped will no more lean on him that smote them; but they will lean 
upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the God of power.  </p>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
In those days and in that time the iniquity of Israel will be sought, 
but there will be none, and the sins of Judah, but they will not be found; for I will pardon him whom I shall make one that is left. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The remnant of Jacob will be in 
the midst of many peoples, like dew from Jehovah, like showers on the grass. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%205:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 5:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That which is left, or the remnant, whether of the individual or of the Church, was also represented by 
tenths, which were holy. And any number involving ten was consequently holy too. Ten therefore has reference to things that are left over, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will remove man far away, and there 
will be many forsaken places in the midst of the land; yet there will be a tenth part in it, and this will return; it will be a wiping out like an oak or a terebinth when the stump is cast away from 
them. The holy seed is its stump. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here that which is left is called 'the holy stump'. In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovah, The city that goes forth a thousand will have a hundred 
that are left, and that which goes forth a hundred will have ten that are left to the house of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:3</a>.   
</blockquote>
In these and many other places the internal sense means remnants, also the subject 
here. The fact that a city is preserved for the sake of the remnant of the Church is clear from what Abraham was told concerning Sodom, Abraham said, Perhaps ten may be found there; and He said, I will 
not destroy it for the sake of ten. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2018:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 18:32</a>.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Ex illis quae in priore capite dicta et ostensa sunt, constat quod per 'nomina' significatae sint haereses et doctrinae; inde constare potest quod per nomina 
in hoc capite nec significentur personae sed res, et hic doctrinae, seu Ecclesiae, quae conservatae sunt, utcumque etiam mutatae, ab antiquissima Ecclesia usque ad Noahum. Sed cum Ecclesia se ita res 
habet, quod temporis tractu decrescat et tandem remaneat inter paucos; pauci illi apud quos remansit tempore diluvii, vocati sunt Noah.  [2] Quod decrescat vera Ecclesia et maneat apud paucos, constare 
potest ab aliis Ecclesiis quae similiter decreverunt; qui remanent, in Verbo vocantur 'reliquiae,' ac 'residuum,' et quidem 'in medio seu meditullio terrae': in universali se res habet sicut in particulari; 
seu sicut in Ecclesia, ita in singulis hominibus: nisi apud unumquemvis a Domino conservarentur reliquiae, non potuisset non perire aeterna morte, nam in reliquiis est vita spiritualis et caelestis; 
similiter in communi seu universali, nisi forent semper aliqui apud quos Ecclesia seu vera fides, periret genus humanum; nam propter aliquot, ut notum est, conservatur civitas, immo totum quoddam 
regnum. Se habent illa sicut in homine cor; quamdiu cor integrum est, circumjacentia viscera possunt vivere; at cum illud languidum, tales occupat omnia et moritur homo. Reliquiae ultimae sunt quae 
significantur per 'Noahum,' nam ceteroquin, ut in cap. seq. vers. 12 constat, 'tota terra corrupta erat.'  [3] De reliquiis illis apud hominem quemcumque et in Ecclesia, agitur passim apud Prophetas; 
ut apud Esaiam, 	Relictus in Zione, et residuus in Hierosolyma, sanctus dicetur Ipsi, omnis scriptus ad vitas in Hierosolyma, cum laverit Dominus sordes {x}filiarum Zionis, et sanguines Hierosolymae 
abluerit e medio ejus, iv 3, 4; </p>
<p>ubi de reliquiis, per quas significantur reliquiae Ecclesiae, tum hominis Ecclesiae, praedicatur 'sanctum'; nam residui in Zione et Hierosolyma, ideo quod residui, 
non potuerunt sancti esse: similiter apud eundem, 	Erit in die illo, non addent amplius reliquiae Israelis, et evasio domus Jacobi, inniti percussori suo; et innitetur Jehovae Sancto Israelis in veritate; 
reliquiae revertentur; 	reliquiae Jacobi, ad Deum potentem, x 20-22: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	In diebus illis, et in tempore illo,... quaeretur iniquitas Israelis, sed non illa; et peccata Jehudae, et 
non invenientur; quia condonabo ei, quem residuum fecero, l 20: </p>
<p>apud Micham, 	Erunt reliquiae Jacobi in medio populorum multorum, sicut ros a cum Jehovah, sicut imbres super herba, v 6. [4] Residuum, 
seu reliquiae, hominis aut Ecclesiae, repraesentatae quoque sunt per 'decimas,' quae sanctae fuerunt; inde quoque numerus decimarius sanctus, quare de residuis praedicantur decem; ut apud Esaiam, 	Removebit 
Jehovah hominem, et multa {1} relicta in medio terrae; et adhuc in ea pars decima, et revertetur, et erit ad exterminandum, sicut quercus et ilex, quando {2} ejicitur stirps de iis, semen 
sanctitatis stirps ejus, vi 12, 13; </p>
<p>ubi residuum vocatur 'stirps sanctitatis:' apud Amosum, 	Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Urbs exiens mille, residuos faciet centum, et exiens centum, residuos faciet decem 
domui Israelis, v 3; </p>
<p>in his et pluribus locis in sensu interno significantur reliquiae de quibus: quod propter reliquias Ecclesiae conservetur civitas, constat ex illo quod dictum Abrahamo de Sodoma, 	Abrahamus 
dixit, Forte inveniantur ibi decem; et dixit, Non perdam propter decem, Gen. xviii 32. @	1 Sch. has multiplicabitur deserta; A.V. translates 'a great forsaking'; R.V. 'The forsaken 
places be many.' Note that S. has relicta not reliquiae, and thus gives the correct translation of the Heb.$ @	2 From the Heb. it seems that the clause might read quae quando ejicitur: stirps est in iis.$ </p>
