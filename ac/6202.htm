<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6202.</strong>我还注意到另外一种流注，它不是通过与一个人同在的灵人进行的，而是通过被某个地狱社群派出进入此人生命气场的其他灵人实现的。他们彼此谈论诸如不利于此人，令他不能接受的那类事物，这通常会导致忧烦、不愉快、沮丧或焦虑以许多不同方式流入他。这类灵人常与我同在，我在我的胃部区域感受到那些注入焦虑的人，并不知道这些焦虑来自何处。然而，每次我都会发现他们是谁，然后听见他们彼此谈论令我的情感无法接受的那类事。贪婪的灵人有时也出现在这个区域，不过处在高一点的位置上；他们注入因对未来的担忧而产生的那种焦虑。我还蒙允许斥责那些灵人，告诉他们说，他们与胃里未消化的食物有关，这种食物会产生口臭，因而令人作呕。我还看见他们被赶走；并且他们一被赶走，焦虑就完全消失了。我有过很多次这样的经历，因此可以非常肯定地说，这些灵人就是焦虑、忧烦的源头。<br />这就是发生在那些无缘无故焦虑和沮丧之人，以及那些经历属灵试探之人当中的那种流注。然而，在试探期间，这类灵人不仅总体上流入，而且地狱灵还特别激起此人所行的恶事，并扭曲和错解试探期间天使用来争战的良善。正在重生的人便进入这种状态，由此被下放到完全属于他自己的东西中。当他过度沉浸于世俗和肉体事物，需要被提升至属灵事物时，这种情况就会发生。</p>

Another influx has also been observed, which is not effected through the spirits who are with the man, but through others who are sent forth from some infernal society into the sphere of the man's life. 
These speak together about such things as are adverse to the man, from which there usually flows in what is troublesome, undelightful, sad, or anxious, with much variety. Such spirits have often been 
with me, and they who infused anxieties were felt in the province of the stomach, without my knowing whence these anxieties came. But they were always detected, and I then heard what they said among 
themselves, which were such things as were adverse to my affections. The avaricious have sometimes appeared in the same region, but a little higher, and infused anxiety from care for the future; and 
it was given me to chide them and tell them that they have relation to such things in the stomach as are undigested, have a bad smell, and thus are nauseous. I have also seen that they were driven away, 
and that then the anxiety entirely ceased, and this repeatedly, that I might know of a certainty that it came from them. Such is the influx with those who for no reason are oppressed with melancholy 
anxiety, and likewise with those who are in spiritual temptation. But in this latter case such spirits not only inflow in general, but also infernal spirits in particular call up the evils which the 
man has done, and pervert and put a wrong interpretation upon the goods. With these the angels then engage in combat. Into such a state comes a man who is being regenerated, whereby he is let down 
into his own; and this takes place when he immerses himself too much in worldly and bodily things, and when he is to be elevated to spiritual things. </p>

I have also noticed another kind of influx which does not take place through the spirits present with a person but through others who are sent out from some community in hell to the sphere emanating 
from that person's life. They talk among themselves about the kinds of things that are unacceptable to the person, which results generally in a flowing into him of what is in many different ways troublesome, 
unpleasant, dejecting, and worrying. Such spirits have often been present with me, when I have experienced in the province of my stomach those who poured in feelings of anxiety - not that I knew 
where the feelings came from. Yet on every occasion I found out who they were, and then I heard them talking to one another about the kinds of things that were unacceptable to my affections. Avaricious 
spirits in the same region have sometimes been visible, though in a slightly higher position; they have poured in the kind of anxiety that results from concern for the future. I have also been allowed 
to rebuke those spirits and to tell them that they correlate with undigested food in the stomach which produces bad breath and so is nauseating. I have also seen them being driven away; and once 
they were driven away, anxiety completely disappeared. I have had this experience a number of times so that I could be quite certain that those spirits were the source of the trouble. </p>

 This is 
the kind of influx that takes place among those who for no good reason are anxious and depressed, and also among those who are undergoing spiritual temptation. During temptation however there is not only 
a general influx of such spirits but also a particular stirring up by spirits from hell of the evils the person has put into practice. 'Those spirits also pervert and put a wrong interpretation on 
the forms of good that the angels use to fight with in temptation. A state such as this is what the person who is being regenerated enters by being let down into what is wholly his own. And this happens 
when he immerses himself too much in worldly and bodily interests and needs to be raised towards spiritual ones. </p>

Observatus etiam est alius influxus qui non fit per spiritus qui apud hominem, sed per alios qui e societate quadam infernali in sphaeram vitae hominis emittuntur; hi inter se de talibus quae homini 
adversa sunt, loquuntur, inde communiter influit incommodum, injucundum, triste aut anxium cum multa varietate; tales saepius fuerunt apud me, et percepti in provincia ventriculi qui infuderunt anxietates, 
praeter quod scirem unde illae essent; sed toties detecti sunt, et tunc audivi quod inter se locuti sunt, quae fuerunt talia quae affectionibus meis adversa fuerunt; avari in eadem regione quandoque 
apparuerunt sed paulo superius, et infuderunt anxium ex cura futuri; et quoque datum est increpare illos et illis dicere quod referant talia in ventriculo quae indigesta sunt, male olent, ita quae 
nauseabunda sunt; vidi etiam quod abacti, et cum abacti sunt, anxium prorsus cessavit; et hoc aliquoties, ut pro certo scirem quod inde.  [2]Talis est influxus apud illos qui ex nulla causa anxietate 
melancholica premuntur, et quoque apud illos qui in tentatione spirituali sunt; ast tunc tales non modo influunt in communi, sed etiam spiritus infernales in particulari excitant mala quae homo egerat, 
ac pervertunt et sinistre explicant bona cum quibus tunc pugnant angeli; in talem statum venit homo qui regeneratur, per quod demittatur in proprium suum; et hoc fit cum in mundana et corporea se 
nimis immergit, cumque ad spiritualia elevandus est. </p>
