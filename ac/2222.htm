<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2222.</strong>“要送他们一程”表祂想远离那种直觉。这是显而易见的，无需解释。原因也是显而易见的，即来自神性的直觉，和由此而来的关于“人类竟是这样的”想法用恐惧击打祂；因为主对全人类的爱如此巨大，以致祂想通过人性本质与神性本质，并神性本质与人性本质的融合永远拯救所有人。所以，当发觉人类竟是这样时，祂想远离那种直觉和随之而来的想法。这就是祂想送他们一程所表示的。</p>

To send them away. That this signifies that He willed to withdraw from that perception, is evident without explication. The reason is also manifest, namely, that the perception from the Divine, and the 
thought therefrom concerning the human race that such was their quality, struck Him with horror, for the Lord's love toward the human race was so great that He willed to save all to eternity by the 
unition of His Human Essence with the Divine, and of the Divine with the Human, on which account, when He perceived that they were such, He willed to withdraw from the perception and derivative thought, 
which is signified by Abraham desiring to "send the men away." </p>

That 'to send them on their way' means that He wished to depart from that perception is clear without explanation. The reason is also evident, namely that perception from the Divine, and consequent thought 
regarding the human race being such, struck Him with horror; for the Lord's love towards the whole human race was so great that He wished to save all for evermore through the Human Essence united 
to the Divine Essence, and the Divine Essence to the Human Essence. Consequently when He perceived the human race to be such He wished to depart from perception and consequent thought. This is what 
is meant by His wishing to send them on their way. </p>

</p><b>2222.</b>
Quod `ad dimittendum illos' significet quod vellet discedere ab illa, constat absque explicatione; causa quoque patet, nempe quod perceptio ex Divino, et inde cogitatio de genere humano quod tale esset, 
horrorem incuteret; amor enim Domini fuit erga universum genus humanum tantus ut omnes per unitionem Essentiae Humanae cum Divina et Divinae cum Humana, salvare in aeternum vellet; quare cum perciperet 
tale esse, a perceptione et cogitatione inde voluit discedere, quod significatur per quod `vellet dimittere illos.' </p>
