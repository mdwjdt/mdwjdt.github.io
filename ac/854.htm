<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>854.</strong>“亚拉腊山”表光明。这一点可从“山”的含义明显看出来，山就是源于爱与仁的良善（<a href="795.htm">795</a>节），也可从“亚拉腊”的含义明显看出来，它就是光明，事实上是某个重生之人中的光明。重生之人的新光，或曙光决非从对信之真理的认知流出，而是从仁爱流出。信之真理就象光芒，而爱或仁就象火焰。正在重生之人的光明并非源于信之真理，而源于仁爱。信之真理本身是从仁爱流出的光芒。故显而易见，“亚拉腊山”表这种光明。这就是试探后所感知的第一缕光明，由于是第一缕光，所以它是模糊的，被称为流明（lumen，描述光通量的物理单位），而非勒克斯（lux，照度单位，是每平方米的流明数）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]854.</strong> The symbolism of the mountains of Ararat as a bit of light is established by the symbolism of a mountain as the good that comes of love and charity (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_854/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>) and of Ararat as a bit of light — the light that a regenerate person enjoys.{*1} The new glimmer — the first glimmer — that comes to the regenerate individual never rises out of a knowledge of faith's truth but out of charity. Faith's truths are like rays of light; love, or charity, is like a flame. The enlightenment of one who is regenerating does not radiate from the truth belonging to faith but from charity. The truths themselves are the rays that beam from it. So one can see that the mountains of Ararat symbolize this kind of light.<br />Such light is the first to shine after a time of struggle, and because it is the first, it is dim and is called a bit of light, not full light.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Although there is no obvious Hebrew root suggesting that אֲרָרַט ('ărāraṭ) means "illumination" (Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, under אֲרָרַט), it is possible that Swedenborg saw a connection with the word אוֹר ('ôr), "light."

That the "mountains of Ararat" signify light [lumen] is evident from the signification of a "mountain" as being the good of love and charity (n. 795); and from the signification of "Ararat" as being 
light, and indeed the light of the regenerate. New light, or the first light of the regenerate, never derives its existence from the knowledges of the truths of faith, but from charity. The truths of 
faith are like rays of light; love or charity is like flame; and the light of him who is being regenerated is not from the truths of faith, but from charity, the truths of faith themselves being rays 
of light therefrom. Thus it is evident that the "mountains of Ararat" signify such light. This is the first light perceived after temptation, and being the first, it is obscure, and is called lumen, not lux. </p>

'The mountains of Ararat' means light.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a mountain' as the good that stems from love and charity, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, and from the meaning of 'Ararat', which is light, indeed 
the light of someone who has been regenerated. The new light, or dawn, of a regenerate person in no way flows from cognitions of the truths of faith but from charity; for the truths of faith are like 
rays of light, and love or charity like the flame. The light in someone who is being regenerated derives not from the truths of faith but from charity. The truths of faith themselves are rays of light 
flowing from charity. It is clear therefore that 'the mountains of Ararat' means that kind of light. This is the first light following temptation, and being the first it is obscure and is called lumen, 
not lux.

</p><b>854.</b>
Quod 'montes Ararat' significent lumen, constare potest a significatione 'montis' quod sit bonum amoris et charitatis, n. 795, et a significatione 'Ararat,' quod est lumen et quidem lumen regenerati. 
 Lumen novum seu primum regenerati nusquam existit a cognitionibus veritatum fidei, sed ex charitate; se enim habent veritates fidei sicut radii lucis, amor seu charitas sicut flamma; lumen in regenerando 
non est ex veritatibus fidei, sed ex charitate; ipsae veritates fidei sunt radii luminis inde; ita constat quod 'montes Ararat' significent tale lumen: hoc lumen est primum lumen post tentationem, 
quod quia primum, est obscurum, et vocatur lumen, non lux. </p>
