<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8740节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8740.</strong>为了变暖，这些人觉得自己在劈柴。在劈柴的时候，木柴下面出现了像人一样的某种东西，同时他们试图攻击这个人。这种情形的发生是因为他们将功德归给自己；他们还自以为义，故自称为圣。凡在世时这样做的人到了来世，都觉得自己在劈柴；这种事也发生在来自我们地球的一些灵人身上，之前我曾通过经历谈到过他们。为了阐明这个主题，我在此从4943节引用这个经历：<br />那些将功德置于善行和作为的人也在脚底之下的低地。其中许多人觉得自己在劈柴。他们所在的地方非常冷，他们觉得只有劳动才能获得温暖。我也与这些人交谈过，并蒙允许问他们是否愿意离开这个地方。他们回答说，他们还没有通过劳动配得它。不过，一旦这个阶段完成，他们就会从那里得以释放。这些人同样是属世的，因为想靠功德赚取救恩的愿望并不是属灵的愿望；事实上，这种愿望来自他们的自我，而非来自主。更重要的是，他们认为自己比别人优越，其中一些人甚至蔑视别人。在来世，这些人若得不到比别人更大的喜乐，就会向主发怒；这解释了为何（有时）当他们砍柴时，他们那堆柴下面看似有主的某种东西，正是他们的愤怒产生了这种表象。但由于他们过着一种虔诚的生活，以这种方式行事是出于无知，而这种无知含有某种纯真之物在里面，所以天使定期被派到他们那里安慰他们。另外，有时，某种看似绵羊的东西会出现在左上方；一看见它们，他们也会从中得到安慰（另见<a href="1110.htm">1110</a>节）。</p>

In order to make themselves warm, the same seem to themselves to cut wood, and while they are cutting, there appears underneath the wood somewhat of a man whom they at the same time attempt to strike. 
This comes to pass because of their attributing merit to themselves; and as they attribute sanctity, they also impute to themselves righteousness. They who do this in the world, in the other life seem 
to themselves to cut wood; as is the case likewise with some from our earth, concerning whom previously, from experience, which experience, for the sake of illustrating the subject, may here be quoted 
(from n. 4943): </p>
<p>     "In the lower earth, under the soles of the feet, are also those who have placed merit in good deeds and in works. Some of them appear to themselves to cut wood. The place where 
they are is rather cold, and they seem to themselves to acquire warmth by their labor. With these also I conversed; and it was given me to ask them whether they wished to come out of that place. They 
replied that they had not yet merited it by their labor. But when this state has been passed through, they are taken out thence. These spirits also are natural, because the wish to merit salvation 
is not spiritual, for it comes from their own; not from the Lord. Moreover they regard themselves as superior to others, and some of them even despise others. If these persons do not receive more joy 
than others in the other life, they are indignant against the Lord; and therefore when they cut wood, there sometimes appears as it were somewhat of the Lord under the wood, and this from their indignation. 
But as they have led a pious life, and have acted in this way from ignorance, in which there was something of innocence, therefore angels are occasionally sent to them who console them. And sometimes 
too there appears to them from above on the left as it were a sheep, at the sight of which they also receive consolation." (See also n. 1110.) </p>

To become warm the same people seem to themselves to be cutting pieces of wood. While they are cuffing there appears underneath the wood something that looks like a human being, whom they try to strike 
at the same time. This happens because they claim merit for themselves; and since they also impute righteousness to themselves they claim holiness. Those who do this in the world seem to themselves 
in the next life to be cutting pieces of wood, as also do some from our planet, whom I have spoken about from experience before. To shed light on the subject let that experience recorded in <a href="4943.htm">4943</a> be repeated 
here: </p>
<p> On the lower earth beneath the soles of the feet there are also those who have regarded good deeds and works to be meritorious. Many of these appear to themselves to be cutting pieces 
of wood. The place where they are is quite a cold one, but they seem to themselves to find warmth in the work they do. I talked to these people too and was allowed to ask them whether they wished to 
leave that place. Their replies were that they had not done enough meritorious work. But once this stage is completed they are released from there. These people likewise are natural, for the desire to 
earn salvation through merit is not a spiritual desire, since it begins in self, not in the Lord. What is more, they regard themselves to be those who are superior to others, and some of them are also 
contemptuous of others. If in the next life they do not receive greater joy than all others, they are angry with the Lord, which explains why [sometimes] when they are cutting pieces of wood, it appears 
as though something of the Lord is underneath their pile of wood - their anger being that which produces this appearance. But because they have led a devout life and have acted in the ways they did 
out of ignorance that had some degree of innocence within it, angels are therefore sent to them periodically to console them. Sometimes, in addition, something that looks like a sheep appears from 
above on the left, and from this too they receive consolation when they see it. </p>

</p><b>8740.</b>
Iidem, ut calefiant, ligna secare sibi videntur, et cum secant, sub lignis apparet quid hominis, quem (t)tunc simul conantur percutere; hoc fit inde quia sibi tribuunt meritum, et quia sanctitatem, 
etiam sibi imputant justitiam; qui hoc faciunt in mundo in altera vita videntur sibi ligna secare, ut quoque aliqui ex nostra tellure, de quibus ab experientia prius, quam experientiam, rem illustrandi 
causa, licet haec ex n. 4943 transferre:{1} In inferiore terra sub plantis, etiam sunt illi qui meritum posuerunt in {2}beneactis et operibus, plures eorum apparent sibi ligna secare; locus ubi sunt 
est frigidior, et videntur sibi calorem sibi acquirere per laborem suum; cum illis etiam locutus sum, et illis dicere datum numne vellent ex loco illo exire; dicebant quod adhuc per laborem non meruerint; 
at cum status ille peractus est, inde eximuntur.  Sunt etiam illi naturales, quia velle mereri salutem non est spirituale, venit enim a proprio non a Domino; et praeterea praeferunt se aliis, et 
quidam eorum contemnunt alios; illi si non gaudium prae reliquis in altera vita recipiunt, indignantur contra Dominum, quapropter cum secant ligna, apparet quasi quid Domini sub lignis; hoc ex indignatione. 
 Sed quia vitam piam egerunt, et ex ignorantia ita fecerunt in qua aliquid innocentiae fuit, ideo aliquoties angeli ad illos mittuntur et illos consolantur; et praeterea apparet illis desuper 
a sinistro quandoque sicut ovis, ex qua visa {3} consolationem accipiunt; </p>
