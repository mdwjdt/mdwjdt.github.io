<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第511节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>511.</strong>因为直觉减弱，从原本非常清晰或明确日益变得一般或模糊，所以爱或用的生活也减弱了。因为爱或用的生活如何，直觉就如何。由善而知真是属天的。属被称为“玛勒列”的教会之人的生命乃是这样：他们更热衷于从真理获得乐趣，而不是从用的形式中得到欢乐。我有幸通过在灵界他们同类当中的经验知道这一点。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]511.</strong> Since perception faded, and from being rather acute and distinct became more general and obscure, the vitality of love and of useful activity waned too; the strength of the living force in love and usefulness determines the strength of perception. To recognize truth on the basis of goodness is a heavenly trait.<br />In addition, the vital force in those who made up the church called Mahalalel was such that they preferred the pleasure gained from truth to the deep satisfaction gained from being useful. This I learned through experience with their kind in the next life. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 511</b></p><p><b>511.</b>
As the perceptive faculty decreased, and from being more particular or distinct, became more general or obscure, so also did the life of love or of uses; for as is the life of love or of uses, so is 
the perceptive faculty. From good to know truth is celestial; the life of those who constituted the church called "Mahalalel" was such that they preferred the delight from truths to the delight from uses, 
as has been given me to know by experience among their like in the other life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 511</b></p><p><b>511.</b>
Because perceptivity diminished, and from being quite clear or definite became increasingly general or vague, the life inherent in love or forms of use diminished too. For what applies to the life inherent 
in love or forms of use consequently applies to perceptivity too. It is celestial to know from good what truth is. The life also of the people who belonged to the Church called Mahalalel was such 
that they preferred pleasure obtained from truths to the joy derived from forms of use. This I have been given to know from experience in the next life from persons of a similar nature.  </p>

</p><b>511.</b>
Quia decrevit perceptivum, et factum est a singulariore seu distinctiore magis et magis commune seu obscurum, ita quoque vita amoris seu usuum; nam sicut se vita amoris seu usuum habet, ita perceptivum; 
ex bono nosse verum est caeleste; vita quoque eorum qui Ecclesiam 'Mahalalel' dictam constituerunt, erat talis ut praeferrent delectationem ex veris jucundo ex usibus; quod a similibus cum illis 
in altera vita datum est per experientiam scire. </p>
