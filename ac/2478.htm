<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2478.</strong>为叫我了解“如果灵人通过他们的外部记忆流入，人就不能通过自己的记忆思考”是怎么回事，这种事（即附体）被允许在我身上发生过两三次；那时，我只知道我的东西不是我的，而是一个灵人的；我还思考过我以前没有思想过的事。在他们离开之前，我无法察觉这一切。</p>

In order that I might know how the case is as to man's not being able to think from his own memory if spirits flowed in from their exterior memory, it has been permitted two or three times that this 
should be done; and I then knew no otherwise than that that was mine which was not mine, but a spirit's; and that I had thought things before which I had not thought; and this I was not able to perceive 
until they withdrew. </p>

So that I might know the implications of man's being unable to think from his own memory if spirits were to flow in from their own exterior memory, such a thing was allowed to happen to me two or three 
times. I knew no other on those occasions than that what was my own was not my own but a spirit's, and that I had thought things previously which I had not thought. All this I was unable to appreciate 
until they had departed. </p>

</p><b>2478.</b>
Ut scirem quomodo se haberet, quod homo ex sua memoria non possit cogitare si spiritus influerent ex memoria exteriore, bis et ter permissum erat ut hoc fieret; et tunc non aliter scivi, quam quod id 
meum esset quod non erat meum sed spiritus, et quod cogitavissem illa prius quae non cogitari; et hoc non potui appercipere priusquam recesserunt. </p>
