<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />5868.创世记45:1，2.约瑟在所有侍立在他旁边的人面前忍不住了，就喊叫说，叫各人都离开我出去！约瑟让弟兄们认他的时候，并没有一人站在他那里。他就放声大哭，埃及人听见了；法老一家也听见了。<br />“约瑟在所有侍立在他旁边的人面前忍不住了”表内在属天层已为联结预备好一切。“就喊叫说”表接近实现。“叫各人都离开我出去”表不一致和相矛盾的记忆知识要从中心被逐出。“约瑟让弟兄们认他的时候，并没有一人站在他那里”表当内在属天层通过居间层与属世层中的真理联结时，并没有任何记忆知识。“他就放声大哭”表怜悯和喜悦。“埃及人听见了”表甚至直到最后和最低层。“法老一家也听见了”表遍及整个属世层。</p>

The Internal Sense.      Verses 1, 2. And Joseph could not restrain himself before all that were standing by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from with me. And there stood not anyone with 
him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. And he gave forth his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. "And Joseph could not restrain himself before 
all that were standing by him," signifies that all things were now made ready by the internal celestial for conjunction; "and he cried," signifies the effect near at hand; "Cause every man to go out 
from with me," signifies that memory-knowledges not in agreement and adverse should be cast out from the midst; "and there stood not anyone with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren," 
signifies that there were not any such knowledges present when the internal celestial through the intermediate conjoined itself with truths in the natural; "and he gave forth his voice in weeping," 
signifies mercy and joy; "and the Egyptians heard," signifies even to ultimates; "and the house of Pharaoh heard," signifies through the whole natural. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1, 2 And Joseph could not contain himself before all those standing with him; and he cried out, Make every man go out from me. And no one stood with him while Joseph made 
himself known to his brothers. And he gave forth his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.  </p>
<p>'And Joseph could not contain himself before all those standing with 
him' means that now everything had been prepared by the internal celestial for the joining together. 'And he cried out' means near to effect. 'Make every man go out from me' means that incompatible 
and contradictory factual knowledge was to be cast away from the centre. 'And no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers means that no such factual knowledge was present when 
the internal celestial joined itself through the intermediary to the truths in the natural. 'And he gave forth his voice in weeping' means mercy and joy. 'And the Egyptians heard' means right through 
to last and lowest [mental images]. 'And the house of Pharaoh heard' means throughout the whole natural.  </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1, 2.  Et non potuit Joseph continere se {1} ad omnes stantes apud illum, et clamavit, Exire facite omnem virum ab apud me; et non stetit quisquam cum illo in notum faciendo 
se Joseph ad fratres suos. Et edidit vocem suam in fletu, et audiverunt Aegyptii, et audivit domus Pharaonis. `Et non potuit Joseph continere se ad omnes stantes apud illum significat quod omnia nunc 
a caelesti interno parata sint ad conjunctionem: `et clamavit' significat prope effectum: `Exire facite omnem virum ab apud me' significat{2} scientifica non congrua et adversantia e medio ejicerentur: 
`et non stetit quisquam (x)cum illo in notum faciendo se Joseph ad fratres suos' significat quod non aliqua adessent cum caeleste internum per medium conjungeret se veris in naturali: `et edidit vocem 
suam in fletu' significat misericordiam et gaudium: `et audiverunt Aegyptii' significat usque ad ultima: 'et audivit domus Pharaonis' significat per universum naturale. @1 A, here only, omnibus stantibus$ @2
