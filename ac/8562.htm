<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8562节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8562.</strong>“百姓没有水喝”表真理，以及随之活力恢复的一种缺乏。这从“水”和“喝”的含义清楚可知：“水”是指信之真理（参看<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>节）；“喝”是指在信之真理上接受教导并领受它们（<a href="3069.htm">3069</a>，<a href="3772.htm">3772</a>，<a href="4017.htm">4017</a>，<a href="4018.htm">4018</a>节），在此焕发活力，因为正如水使属世的生活焕发活力，真理和对真理的认知使属灵生命焕发活力。事实上，一个处于属灵生命的人渴望以诸如被称为天上的食物和喝的东西的那类事物来维持这生命，这些事物就是信之良善和真理；就像处于属世生命的人渴望以诸如构成属世食物和喝的东西的那类事物来维持这生命一样。<br />现在论述的主题之所以是涉及真理的试探，是因为之前论述的主题是涉及良善的试探，这次试探过后，他们获得吗哪，吗哪表示良善。当主将良善赐予某人时，这人便进入对真理的一种渴望，这种渴望照着真理的缺乏而被激起，因为良善不断渴求良善。对真理的一切情感皆源于良善。这情形就像食物，没有喝的，食物无法滋养属世生命；此外，食物会产生对喝的东西的一种渴望，与喝的东西相结合，食物才能实现它的目的或功用。这就是涉及真理的试探紧随涉及良善的试探而来的原因。试探攻击一个人所喜爱和渴望的东西（<a href="4274.htm">4274</a>，<a href="4299.htm">4299</a>节）。</p>

And there was no water for the people to drink. That this signifies a lack of truth and of the consequent refreshment, is evident from the signification of "water," as being the truth of faith (see n. 
2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668); and from the signification of "drinking," as being to be instructed in the truths of faith and to receive them (n. 3069, 3772, 4017, 4018), here, to be refreshed; for 
as water and drink refresh the natural life, so truths and the knowledges of truth refresh the spiritual life. For he who is in spiritual life longs for the sustenance thereof from such things as are 
called heavenly food and drink, which are the goods and truths of faith; in like manner as he who is in natural life longs for sustenance from such things as are natural food and drink. [2] That temptation 
as to truth is now treated of, is because temptation as to good was treated of just before, after which temptation they received the manna, by which is signified good. For when man is endowed with 
good by the Lord, he comes into a longing for truth, and this longing is kindled according to the lack of truth, because good continually strives after truth. All the genuine affection of truth is 
from good. The case herein is like food, which without drink cannot nourish the natural life; and it is also like it in that food longs for drink, with which it may be conjoined so as to serve for use. 
This then is the reason why temptation as to truth follows immediately after temptation as to good. Temptation attacks that which a man loves and longs for (n. 4274, 4299). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8562</b></p><p><b>8562.</b>
'And there was no water for the people to drink' means a lack of truth and consequently of refreshment. This is clear from the meaning of 'water' as the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>; and from the meaning of 'drinking' as receiving instruction in the truths of faith and accepting them, dealt with in <a href="3069.htm">3069</a>, <a href="3772.htm">3772</a>, <a href="4017.htm">4017</a>, <a href="4018.htm">4018</a>, at this point being refreshed, because just as 
water and drink refresh a person's natural life, so truths and cognitions of truth refresh his spiritual life. For one whose life is spiritual desires to sustain that life with such things as are called 
heavenly food and drink, which are the forms of good and the truths of faith, even as one whose life is natural desires to sustain this with such things as constitute natural food and drink. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason why the subject now is a temptation having to do with truth is that the subject immediately before was a temptation which had to do with good, after which temptation the people received 
the manna, by which good is meant. When the Lord imparts good to someone that person comes to have a desire for truth, and this desire is aroused according to the lack of it; for good craves truth continually. 
Every genuine affection for truth springs from good. The situation is as it is with food. Without drink food is unable to supply nourishment to natural life; furthermore food creates a craving 
for drink, in order that, when combined with it, it may serve its purpose. This then is the reason why a temptation having to do with truth comes immediately after a temptation having to do with good. 
Temptation attacks what a person loves and desires, <a href="4274.htm">4274</a>, <a href="4299.htm">4299</a>. </p>

`Et nulla aqua ad bibendum populo': quod significet defectum veri et inde recreationis, constat ex significatione `aquae' quod sit verum {1} fidei, de qua n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, et ex significatione 
`bibere' quod sit instrui in veris fidei, et recipere illa, de qua n. 3069, 3772, 4017, 4018, hic recreari, nam sicut aqua et potus recreant vitam naturalem, ita vera et cognitiones veri vitam 
spiritualem, {2}nam qui in vita spirituali est desiderat sustentationem ejus a talibus quae vocantur cibi et potus caelestes, quae sunt bona et vera fidei, aeque ac qui in vita naturali sustentationem 
a talibus quae sunt cibi et potus naturales. 	2 Quod nunc agatur de tentatione quoad verum, est quia mox prius actum est de tentatione quoad bonum, post quam tentationem acceperunt mannam, per quam 
significatur bonum; cum {3}enim homo donatur bono a Domino, tunc venit in desiderium veri, et hoc desiderium accenditur secundum defectum ejus, bonum enim jugiter appetit verum; omnis affectio genuina 
veri ex bono est; se habet (d)hoc sicut cibus, quod is absque potu nequeat nutricioni esse vitae naturali, et quoque quod cibus appetat potum, cum quo conjungatur, ut inserviat usui; haec nunc causa 
est cur tentatio quoad verum sequatur immediate tentationem quoad bonum; tentatio {4} aggreditur id quod amat et desiderat homo, n. 4274, 4299. 	@1 i quod$ 	@2 qui enim$ 	@3 itaque$ 	@4 i enim$ </p>
