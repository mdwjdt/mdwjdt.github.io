<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第719节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>719.</strong>“不洁净的牲畜”表恶情。这一点从关于洁净牲畜的阐述和说明清楚可知。之所以称为洁净的牲畜，是因为它们是温和、良善和有用的。不洁净的牲畜则刚好相反，它们凶狠、邪恶、无用，其中也有各个属和种（种类）。在圣言中，这些不洁净的牲畜被描述为狼、熊、狐狸、猪等等，它们表示各种恶欲和恶意。本节经文说，要把不洁净的牲畜或恶情也带进方舟，原因如下：这里描述的是该教会成员的秉性，尤其藉着方舟来描述，因而藉着方舟内的事物，确切地说藉着被带进方舟内的事物，即他重生前就在他里面的事物来描述。他里面的良善与真理在他重生前就已被主供给和赐下。因为若没有真理与良善，谁也无法重生。但此处论及的是他里面的邪恶，用不洁净的牲畜来表示。人在重生期间，他里面的邪恶必须被驱散，也就是说，必须通过良善被分解与调和。因为人里面的实际和遗传的邪恶无法被驱散到逐出去的程度，而是永远保持植入。然而，它可通过主的良善被分解与调和到无害并看不到的程度。这是至今未知的一个奥秘。实际的邪恶就是那些被分解与调和的邪恶，而不是那些遗传的邪恶，这也是未知之事。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]719.</strong> The symbolism of an animal that is not clean as negative emotions can be seen from statements made and supported above about clean animals [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45-46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_714" target=_top>714-715</a>].<br />The term clean applies to animals that are tame, well behaved, and useful. Unclean animals are the opposite: savage, evil, and useless. They come in different genera and species and in the Word are exemplified by wolves, bears, foxes, swine, and many others, symbolizing various types of craving and malice.<br />Why does this verse say that unclean animals — wicked feelings — were to be brought into the ark? The situation is this: The present passage is characterizing the people in this church in terms of the ark and its contents, that is, what was brought into it — in other words, what existed in those people before they were reborn. They did have the true ideas and good impulses that the Lord supplied and granted to them before they underwent regeneration, since without a fund of truth and goodness no one could ever regenerate. Here mention is made of the evil in them, symbolized by the unclean animals.<br />When we are being reborn, there are evils that have to be dispelled, or rather pried loose and tempered, by means of good. None of the evil that we have committed or inherited can ever be removed to the point of complete abolition. It lurks within and is merely loosened and mitigated by the good we receive from the Lord, to the point where it becomes harmless and invisible. This secret has not yet come into common knowledge.<br />It is the evil we have actually committed that relaxes its grip on us and softens, not so much the evil we have inherited. This too is a matter unknown. </p>

That evil affections are signified by the "beasts not clean" is evident from what has been said and shown before respecting the clean beasts. They are called "clean" because they are gentle, good, and 
useful. The unclean-of which there are genera and species-are the contrary, being fierce, evil, and not useful. In the Word also they are described as wolves, bears, foxes, swine, and many others; and 
various cupidities and evil dispositions are signified by them. As to its being here said that unclean beasts also (that is, evil affections) should be brought into the ark, the truth is that the man 
of that church is here described such as he was in character, and this by the ark, and therefore by the things that were in the ark, or that were brought into the ark; that is to say, the things are 
described that were in the man before he was regenerated. There were in him the truths and goods with which he had been furnished and gifted by the Lord before regeneration; for without truths and goods 
no one can ever be regenerated. But here the evils that were in him are spoken of, and are signified by the unclean beasts. There are evils in man which must be dispersed while he is being regenerated, 
that is, which must be loosened and attempered by goods; for no actual and hereditary evil in man can be so dispersed as to be abolished. It still remains implanted; and can only be so far loosened 
and attempered by goods from the Lord that it does not injure, and does not appear, which is an arcanum hitherto unknown. Actual evils are those which are loosened and attempered, and not hereditary 
evils; which also is a thing unknown. </p>

'The beast that is not clean' means evil affections. This is clear from what has been stated and shown already about clean beasts. The clean ones are so called because they are gentle, good, and useful. 
Those that are not clean are the opposite - savage, evil, and useless - of which there are genera and species. These in the Word are also portrayed as wolves, bears, foxes, pigs, and many others, 
which mean various evil desires and malicious intentions. In the present verse it is said that unclean beasts, or evil affections, were to be taken into the ark as well, for the following reason: The 
character of the member of this Church is being described here, specifically by means of the ark, and thus by the things that were in or rather had been brought into the ark, that is, the things that 
already resided with man prior to his being regenerated. Truths and goods resided with him already, which the Lord had supplied and granted prior to his regeneration, for without truths and goods no one 
can possibly be regenerated. Here the evils that resided with him are referred to and are meant by 'unclean beasts' that are mentioned. While a person is being regenerated evils are present that have 
to be dispersed, that is, broken down and modified by means of goods. For no evil with man, that of his own doing or that which is hereditary, can ever be dispersed so far as to be banished, but remains 
implanted for ever. Yet it is broken down and modified by means of goods from the Lord so as to be innocuous and not seen. This is an arcanum that is still unknown. It is the evils of man's own 
doing that are broken down and modified, rather than those which are hereditary - something else which is not known. </p>

</p><b>719.</b>
Quod per 'bestiam non mundam' significentur affectiones malae, constat ab illis quae de bestiis mundis prius dicta et ostensa sunt: 'mundae' dictae quia mites, bonae et utiles; 'non mundae' sunt quae 
contrariae, immites, malae, et inutiles, quarum genera et species sunt; in Verbo etiam exprimuntur per 'lupos, ursos, vulpes, sues,' et plures, et significantur per eas diversae cupiditates et malitiae. 
Quod hic dicatur quod in arcam quoque introducerentur 'immundae bestiae,' seu malae affectiones, ita res se habet, quod hic describatur homo hujus Ecclesiae quales erat, et quidem per 'arcam,' et 
sic per illa quae in arca, seu quae introducta sunt in arcam, hoc est, quae fuerunt apud hominem antequam regeneraretur; apud illum fuerunt vera et bona, quibus, antequam regeneratus, a Domino instructus 
et donatus est, nam absque veris et bonis nusquam aliquis regenerari potest; hic memorantur mala quae apud eum et significantur per 'bestias immundas': cum regeneratur homo, sunt mala quae discutienda, 
hoc est, quae resolvenda et temperanda per bona; nusquam enim aliquod malum actuale et hereditarium apud hominem ita discuti potest ut aboleatur, sed manet insitum, sed modo resolvitur et temperatur 
per bona a Domino ut non noceat et appareat, quod est arcanum adhuc incognitum: mala actualia sunt quae resolvuntur et temperantur, non ita mala hereditaria, quod etiam est res incognita. </p>
