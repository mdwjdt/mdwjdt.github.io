<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10307节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10307</strong>.“你们所要作的香，不可按这调和之法来为自己作”表由教会的神圣真理构成的这敬拜绝不可应用于人自己的爱。这从“香”、“按这调和之法”和“不可为自己作”的含义清楚可知：“香”是指敬拜（参看<a href="10298.htm">10298</a>节）；“按这调和之法来作”是指由教会的神圣真理构成，因为“按这调和之法”意味着用同样的香料制作，这些香料，即拿他弗、施喜列和喜利比拿，表示在其适当次序中的教会的神圣真理（<a href="10292.htm">10292</a>-<a href="10294.htm">10294</a>节）；“不可为自己作”是指不可应用于人自己的功用，因而应用于人自己的爱。因为凡一个人为自己所做的事，都为了自己的爱而做的。此处之所以表示这种应用，是因为经上说他们为自己作这香。<br />有必要说明这一切是何情形。教会所拥有的一切真理都关注两种爱，即对神之爱和对邻之爱。教会所拥有的一切真理皆源于由神性真理本身构成的圣言，而整部圣言系于这两种爱，这一点清楚可见于马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">22:37</a>）、马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.30.htm">12:30-31</a>）和路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.27.htm">10:27</a>）。这些地方说，一切律法和先知书都系于它们；“律法和先知书”表示整部圣言。但将神性真理或教会的真理应用于人自己的爱则恰恰相反。人通过如此行而从主转向自己，也就是从天堂转向地狱，成为那里的灵人当中的一员。因为地狱里的人在背后拥有主，在脸前拥有自己的爱。事实上，当被天使观之时，他们看上去是颠倒的，头朝下、脚朝上。<br />当神的真理应用于人自己的爱时，它们就不再是真理，因为把它们应用于这些爱就会允许邪恶进入它们，而邪恶会败坏它们，使它们看上去就是虚假。这种人若被告知，他们不应以这种方式，而应以另一种方式来对待并理解真理，就不愿去理解它；事实上，有些人无法理解。因为说违背人自己的爱所确认或强化的原则或假设的话，就是说违背这个人自己的话；因为这是违背由他的意愿所支配的理解力。在圣言中，经上多次论述了那些通过应用于自己的爱而歪曲真理、玷污良善的人；在那里，尤其在启示录，经上论述了巴比伦。</p>

And the incense which thou makest in its quality, ye shall not make for yourselves. That this signifies that worship from the holy truths of the church must not be applied in favor of the loves of man, 
is evident from the signification of "incense," as being worship (see above, n. 10298); from the signification of "making in its quality," as being from the holy truths of the church; for to make in 
its quality is to make from the same spices, and by the spices, which were stacte, onycha, and galbanum, are signified the holy truths of the church in their order (n. 10292-10294); and from the signification 
of "not making for yourselves," as being not to apply in favor of one's own uses, thus of one's loves, for that which a man does for the sake of himself, he does for the sake of his loves. 
Such application is here meant because it is said, "to make for yourselves."  [2] How the case herein is, shall also be told. All the truths of the church have regard to two loves, namely, to love to 
God, and to love toward the neighbor. That the whole Word, which is Divine truth itself, and from which are all the truths of the church, hangs on these two loves, is evident in Matthew 22:37; Mark 12:30, 
31; and Luke 10:27, where it is said that all the Law and the Prophets hang on these loves, and by "the Law and the Prophets" is signified the whole Word. Quite the contrary, however, is it to apply 
Divine truth, or the truths of the church, in favor of the loves of man. By so doing a man turns from the Lord to himself, which is to turn from heaven to hell, and becomes as one of the spirits 
there; for in hell they have the Lord at the back and their own loves in front; nay, when looked at by the angels they appear inverted, with the head downward and the feet upward. [3] When truths Divine 
are applied in favor of the loves of man, they are no longer truths, because by means of these applications evil enters them, and perverts them, and makes them appear false. If it is then said to 
such men that they are not so to be understood, but otherwise, they are not willing to apprehend it, and some do not apprehend it; for to say what is contrary to principles confirmed by his loves, is 
to say what is contrary to the man himself, because contrary to his understanding which is from his will. As regards those who by means of application in favor of their loves falsify truths and adulterate 
goods, much is said in the Word where Babel is treated of, especially in Revelation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10307</b></p><p><b>10307.</b>
'And the incense which you make, according to its composition, you shall not make for yourselves' means that worship consisting of the Church's holy truths must not be attached to the loves that are 
a person's own. This is clear from the meaning of 'the incense' as worship, dealt with above in <a href="10298.htm">10298</a>; from the meaning of 'making according to its composition' as consisting of the Church's holy truths 
('making according to its composition' implies making from the same spices, and those spices - stacte, onycha, and galbanum - mean the Church's holy truths in their proper order, <a href="10292.htm">10292</a>-<a href="10294.htm">10294</a>); and 
from the meaning of 'you shall not make for yourselves' as not attaching to selfish purposes, thus to the loves which are a person's own. For what a person does for the sake of himself he does for the 
sake of his own selfish loves. An attaching is meant here because it speaks of their making the incense for themselves.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation in all this must also be stated. All the truths which the 
Church possesses have two loves in view - love to God and love towards the neighbour. The whole Word, consisting of Divine Truth itself, from which all the truths that the Church possesses are derived, 
hangs on those two loves, as is clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2022:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 22:40</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:30,31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:30,31</a>; and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:27</a>. These places say that all the Law and the Prophets hang on them; and by 'the Law and the Prophets' the whole Word 
is meant. But it is quite the opposite to attach Divine Truth or the Church's truths to the loves that are a person's own. By doing this the person turns away from the Lord towards self, that is, 
away from heaven towards hell and becomes as one of those who are there. For those in hell have the Lord behind their back and their own loves before their face. Indeed when seen by angels they appear 
upside down, with head downwards and feet upwards.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When God's truths become attached to the loves that are a person's own they cease to be truths, because attaching them to those loves allows 
evil to penetrate them, which perverts them and produces an outward display of falsity from them. But if such people are told that truths should not be treated and understood in that way but in some 
other, they do not wish to grasp this, and some in fact cannot do so. For to tell anyone something that goes against the assumptions reinforced by his own loves is to go against the actual person; for 
it is to go against his understanding as governed by his will. Those who falsify truths and adulterate forms of good by attaching them to their own selfish loves are dealt with many times in the Word, 
where Babel is the subject, in particular in the Book of Revelation.  </p>

`Et suffimentum, quod facis in qualitate ejus, non facietis vobis': quod significet non applicandum esse cultum ex sanctis Ecclesiae veris ad amores hominis, constat ex significatione `suffimenti' quod 
sit cultus, de qua supra n. 10,298, ex significatione `facere in qualitate ejus' quod sit ex sanctis Ecclesiae veris, nam facere in qualitate ejus est ex iisdem aromatibus, et per `aromata,' quae 
fuerunt stacte, onyche, et galbanum, significantur sancta Ecclesiae vera in suo ordine, n. 10,292-10,294, et ex significatione `non facere vobis' quod sit applicare ad {1}usus proprios, ita ad amores 
ejus, nam quod homo facit propter se, {2} facit propter amores suos; applicatio hic intelligitur, quia dicitur facere sibi. 	[2] Quomodo cum hoc se habet, etiam dicetur: omnia vera (x)Ecclesiae spectant 
binos amores,{3} nempe amorem in Deum et amorem erga proximum; quod totum Verbum, quod est ipsum Divinum Verum, ex quo omnia vera Ecclesiae, pendeat a duobus illis amoribus, constat apud Matthaeum 
xxii (x)38 [A. V. 40]; apud Marcum xii 30, 31; et apud Lucam x 27; dicitur ibi quod omnis Lex et Propheta ab illis pendeat, et per Legem et Prophetam significatur totum Verbum; contrarium autem est applicare 
Divinum Verum, seu vera Ecclesiae, ad amores hominis; inde homo se vertit a Domino ad semet, quod est a caelo ad infernum, et fit sicut unus illorum ibi, nam in inferno Dominum a tergo habent 
et amores suos a facie; immo cum inspiciuntur ab angelis, apparent inversi, capite deorsum et pedibus sursum. 	[3] Cum vera Divina applicantur ad amores hominis, non sunt amplius vera, quoniam malum 
per applicationes intrat illa, quod pervertit illa, ac inducit faciem falsi; si tunc illis dicitur quod non ita intelligenda sint, sed aliter, non volunt capere, et quidam non capiunt; nam dicere contra 
principia per amores suos confirmata est contra ipsum hominem, quia contra intellectuale ejus a voluntario ejus. De illis qui per applicationem ad amores suos falsificant vera et (x)adulterant bona, 
multis in Verbo agitur, ubi de Babele, imprimis in Apocalypsi. @1 amores hominis$ @2 i hoc$ @3 See p. ix preliminary note 1. A ends here.$ </p>
