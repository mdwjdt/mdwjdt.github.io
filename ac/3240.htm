<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3240节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3240.</strong>“约珊生了示巴和底但”表来自第一类的衍生物。这从下文所论述的“约珊”和他儿子“示巴和底但”的代表清楚可知。由于他们在此只有名字，并且表示主的属灵教会的状态和衍生物，故必须对这类状态和衍生的一般性质有所阐述。属天教会在这一方面不同于属灵教会：那些属于属天教会、被称为属天的人处于爱，也就是说，他们处在爱的良善与真理之中；而那些属于属灵教会、被称为属灵的人则处于信，也就是说，他们处在信的良善与真理之中。属天之人所拥有的良善在于对主之爱，其真理在于对邻之爱。而属灵之人所拥有的良善在于对邻之仁，其真理在于信，只要这真理是关于仁的教义。由此可见，主的属灵国度和祂的属天国度一样，也拥有良善与真理，只是大不相同。<br />此外，要知道，这些国度的居民凭良善与真理而与众不同。因为有些人更多地处于良善，而有些人则更多地处于真理。衍生物，也就是说，良善的衍生物和真理的衍生物正是由此产生。在主的属灵国度，良善的衍生物就是本节所提到的约珊的儿子所代表的；而该国度的真理则是下一节所提到的米甸的儿子所代表的。由于属灵之人（即那些更多地处于良善的人和那些更多地处于真理的人）分为两类，故他们拥有两种教义，即仁之教义和信之教义。仁之教义为那些处于信之良善、在此由约珊的儿子来表示的人而存在；信之教义则为那些处于信之真理、由米甸的儿子来表示的人而存在。<br />示巴和底但就是那些构成第一类的人，也就是那些在主的属灵国度中处于信之良善、拥有仁之教义的人。由此可知，“示巴和底但”表示对属天事物的认知，或也可说，表示那些具有这类认知的人，即具有仁之教义的人。因为教义就是认知，并且属灵之人所具有的属天之物是仁爱。示巴和底但表示这些认知，如第一卷所示（<a href="117.htm">117</a>，<a href="1168.htm">1168</a>，<a href="1171.htm">1171</a>，<a href="1172.htm">1172</a>节）；不过，在那里，示巴和底但是含的曾孙，被视为拉玛的儿子。然而，要知道，像含、雅弗和闪这样的人物是不存在的，但那些属于大洪水后、名为“挪亚”的教会之人在良善与真理方面被分成了三类，这些就是赋予这些类别的名字（<a href="736.htm">736</a>，<a href="1062.htm">1062</a>，<a href="1065.htm">1065</a>，<a href="1140.htm">1140</a>，<a href="1141.htm">1141</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>节等等）。然而，有些民族也被如此称呼，但这些民族起源于其他人，这从此处示巴和底但出身于约珊，就是亚伯拉罕与基土拉的儿子明显看出来。<br />至于“示巴”表示那些具有对属天事物的认知之人，因而表示那些处于信之良善的人，这从前面（<a href="117.htm">117</a>，<a href="1171.htm">1171</a>节）所引用的经文明显可知。“底但”也具有同样的含义，这也可从前面（<a href="1172.htm">1172</a>节）引用的经文，以及下面的经文明显看出来。以赛亚书：<br />论阿拉伯的默示：底但结伴的客旅啊，你们必在阿拉伯的森林中过夜；提玛地的居民拿水来迎口渴的，拿饼来接待逃难的。因为他们逃避刀剑和出了鞘的刀剑。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.13.htm">21:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“在森林中过夜”表在良善方面变得荒凉。因为“阿拉伯”表那些具有属天事物，也就是信之良善的人，因此“在森林中过夜”是指不再处于良善中，荒凉由此而来，这也由“逃避刀剑和出了鞘的刀剑”来描述。属天事物，就是信之良善，或也可说它们的仁爱行为由“拿水来迎口渴的，拿饼来接待逃难的”来表示。<br />耶利米书：<br />我就从耶和华的手中接了这杯，给耶和华所差遣我去的各族的人喝。就是耶路撒冷和犹大的城邑，并耶路撒冷的君王与首领，使这城邑荒凉；又有埃及王法老和他的臣仆、首领，以及他的众民；推罗的诸王；西顿的诸王；底但、提玛、布斯和一切剃周围鬓发的；心利的诸王；以拦的诸王；玛代的诸王；北方的诸王。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.17.htm">25:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.22.htm">22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.25.htm">25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.26.htm">26</a>）<br />此处论述的也是属灵教会的荒凉，该教会不同类别被依次列举出来，由“耶路撒冷”、“犹大的城邑”、“埃及”、“推罗”、“西顿”、“底但”、“提玛”、“布斯”、“心利”、“以拦”、“玛代”来表示。<br />以西结书：<br />示巴人、底但人、他施的客商和其间的少壮狮子，都必问你说：你来要抢夺财物吗？你聚集军队要夺取猎物吗？要搬运金银，掳去牲畜财货吗？要抢夺大量财物吗？（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.13.htm">38:13</a>）<br />这论及哥革，哥革表示脱离内在的外在敬拜，也就是偶像崇拜（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节）。“示巴人、底但人”表示敬拜的内在事物，也就是信之良善；“他施”表示相应的外在敬拜。哥革（或脱离内在的外在敬拜）想要搬运的“金银、牲畜、财货和财物”是指对良善与真理的认知，那些“示巴人和底但人”所表示的人为这些认知而争战，并扞卫之，他们因此被称为“少壮狮子”。“示巴”的本来意义是指那些具有对良善的认知之人，“底但”是指那些具有对源于良善的真理的认知之人。</p>

And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan. That this signifies the derivations from the first class, is evident from the representation of Jokshan and of his sons Sheba and Dedan, concerning whom something will 
be said in what follows. As here there are mere names, and the states and derivations of the Lord's spiritual church are signified by them, the nature of such states and derivations in general must 
be declared. The celestial church differs from the spiritual church in this respect: Those who are of the celestial church, and are called celestial, are in love, that is to say they are in the good 
and truth of love; while those who are of the spiritual church, and are called spiritual, are in faith, that is, they are in the good and truth of faith. The good which the celestial have is that of 
love to the Lord, and their truth is that of love to the neighbor; whereas the good which the spiritual have is that of charity toward the neighbor, and their truth is that of faith, insofar as this truth 
is doctrine concerning charity. This shows that the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as well as His celestial kingdom, has good and truth, but with much difference. [2] Be it known moreover that they who 
are in each kingdom are distinguished among themselves by good and truth, for the reason that there are some who are more in good and others who are more in truth. From this then come the derivations, 
that is, the derivations of good and the derivations of truth. In the Lord's spiritual kingdom the derivations of good are what are represented by the sons of Jokshan who are named in this verse; 
but the derivations of truth in this kingdom are what are represented by the sons of Midian who are named in the following verse. Now as there are two classes of the spiritual (those who are more in good, 
and those who are more in truth), they have therefore two kinds of doctrinals, namely, those of charity and those of faith; doctrinals of charity for those who are in the good of faith and are here 
signified by the sons of Jokshan; but doctrinals of faith for those who are in the truth of faith and are signified by the sons of Midian. [3] Sheba and Dedan are those who constitute the first class, 
that is, those who in the Lord's spiritual kingdom are in the good of faith, and who have doctrinals of charity. From this it follows that by "Sheba and Dedan" are signified the knowledges of celestial 
things, or what is the same, those who are in these knowledges, that is, who are in the doctrinals of charity; for doctrinals are knowledges, and the celestial of the spiritual man is that of charity. 
That "Sheba" and "Dedan" have this signification was shown in volume 1 (n. 117, 1168, 1171, 1172); but there Sheba and Dedan are the great-grandsons of Ham, and are called sons of Raamah; but 
be it known that there were no such persons as Ham and Japheth and Shem, but that those who after the flood belonged to the church called "Noah" were distinguished as to goods and truths into three classes, 
and these were the names given to those classes (n. 736, 1062, 1065, 1140, 1141, 1162, and in other places). Nevertheless there were nations that were so called, but these nations were descended 
from others, as it is here plainly said that Sheba and Dedan were descended from Jokshan, the son of Abraham by Keturah.  [4] That "Sheba" signifies those who are in the knowledges of celestial things, 
thus who are in the good of faith, is evident from the passages cited above (n 117, 1171); and that "Dedan" has a similar signification is also evident from the passages cited (n. 1172), and further 
from the following. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The prophecy concerning Arabia: in the forest in Arabia shall ye spend the night, ye companies of Dedan; bring ye waters to meet him that is thirsty, ye inhabitants 
of the land of Tema, with the bread thereof meet him that wandereth, for they shall wander before swords, before an outstretched sword (Isa. 21:13-15). "Spending the night in the forest," signifies 
being desolated as to good; for by "Arabia" are meant those who are in celestial things, that is, who are in the good of faith, and "spending the night there in the forest" is being no longer in 
goods, from which comes desolation, which is also described by "wandering before swords, before an outstretched sword." Celestial things, that is, the goods of faith, or what is the same, the works of 
charity in which they are, are signified by "bringing waters to meet him that is thirsty, and meeting with bread him that wandereth." [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I took the cup from the hand of Jehovah, 
and made all the nations drink unto whom Jehovah sent me: Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings and her princes, to give them up to desolation; Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants, and 
his princes, and all his people; and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon; Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are clipped at the corner [of the beard]; all the kings of Zimri, and all 
the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media, and all the kings of the north (Jer. 25:17-19, 22-23, 25-26). Here also the desolation of the spiritual church is treated of, the different classes of 
which church are enumerated in order, and are signified by "Jerusalem," the "cities of Judah," "Egypt," "Tyre," "Zidon," "Dedan," "Tema," "Buz," "Zimri," "Elam," "Media." [6] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Sheba 
and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all the young lions thereof shall say to thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? Hast thou assembled thine assembly to take the prey? to carry away silver 
and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil? (Ezek. 38:13); </p>
<p>treating of Gog, by whom is signified external worship separate from internal, which is idolatrous (n. 1151); "Sheba and Dedan" 
denote the internal things of worship, namely, the goods of faith; "Tarshish" denotes a corresponding external worship; the "silver, gold, cattle, goods, spoil," which Gog, or the external of worship 
separate from the internal, desires to take away, are the knowledges of good and truth for which they fight, and which those defend who are signified by "Sheba and Dedan;" wherefore these are called 
"young lions." "Sheba" properly denotes those who are in the knowledges of good; "Dedan" those who are in the knowledges of truth from good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3240</b></p><p><b>3240.</b>
'And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan' means the derivatives from the first division. This is clear from the representation of 'Jokshan' and his sons 'Sheba and Dedan' dealt with below. Since they are mere 
names here and they mean states and derivatives of the Lord's spiritual Church, something about what they are in general must be stated. The celestial Church differs from the spiritual Church in that 
in those who belong to the celestial Church and who are called celestial, love - that is to say, the good and truth of love - is present; but in those who belong to the spiritual Church and who are 
called spiritual, faith - that is to say, the good and truth of faith - is present. Good as it exists with those who are celestial consists in love to the Lord, and truth as it exists with them in love 
towards the neighbour. But good as it exists with those who are spiritual consists in charity towards the neighbour, and truth as it exists with them in faith insofar as this is doctrine concerning 
charity. From this it may be seen that good and truth are present in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as they are in His celestial kingdom, yet are considerably different. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized 
in addition that the inhabitants of those kingdoms are distinguished from one another by means of good and truth for the reason that some are governed more by good, others more by truth. And it is from 
this that derivatives arise, that is to say, derivatives of good and derivatives of truth. The derivatives of good in the Lord's spiritual kingdom are those which are represented by the sons of Jokshan, 
who are referred to in this verse, but the derivatives of truth there are those which are represented by the sons of Midian, who are referred to in the next verse. Now because there are two categories 
of spiritual people - those governed more by good and those governed more by truth - two varieties of doctrine therefore exist among them, namely matters of doctrine concerning charity and matters 
of doctrine concerning faith. Matters of doctrine concerning charity exist for the sake of those governed by the good of faith, who are meant here by the sons of Jokshan. But matters of doctrine 
concerning faith exist for the sake of those governed by the truth of faith, who are meant by the sons of Midian. Sheba and Dedan are those who constitute the first category, that is, people in the Lord's 
spiritual kingdom who are governed by the good of faith and with whom matters concerning charity exist. This explains why Sheba and Dedan mean the cognitions of celestial things, or what amounts 
to the same, those with whom such cognitions exist, that is, with whom matters of doctrine concerning charity exist, for matters of doctrine are cognitions, and that which is celestial with the spiritual 
man is charity. For Sheba and Dedan mean those cognitions, as has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="117.htm">117</a>, <a href="1168.htm">1168</a>, <a href="1171.htm">1171</a>, <a href="1172.htm">1172</a>, though there they are the great-grandsons of Ham, and are called the sons of Raamah. 
It should be realized however that Ham, like Japheth and Shem also, never was an actual person, but that those who belonged to the Church after the Flood called Noah were distinguished as regards 
goods and truths into three groups, and these groups were referred to by those names, <a href="736.htm">736</a>, <a href="1062.htm">1062</a>, <a href="1065.htm">1065</a>, <a href="1140.htm">1140</a>, <a href="1141.htm">1141</a>, <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, and in various other places. Nevertheless there were nations which were so called, 
but these were descended from different individuals, as is evident here from Sheba and Dedan who were descended from Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 'Sheba' meaning those 
with whom cognitions of celestial things exist- thus those governed by the good of faith - this is clear from the places introduced in <a href="117.htm">117</a>, <a href="1171.htm">1171</a>. 'Dedan' has a similar meaning, as is clear from the texts 
quoted in <a href="1172.htm">1172</a>, as well as from the following: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The prophecy concerning Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you will spend the night, O bands of Dedanites. To the thirsty bring water; O inhabitants 
of the land of Tema, meet with his bread the fugitive, for they will flee before the swords, before the drawn sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Spending the night in the forest in Arabia' stands for 
being made desolate as regards good. For 'Arabia' means those with whom celestial things exist, that is, the goods of faith, so that 'speeding the night there in the forest' is when goods exist no longer, 
and therefore means desolation, which is also described by 'fleeing before the swords, before the drawn sword'. Celestial things, that is, the goods of faith - or what amount to the same, the works 
of charity - which are theirs, are meant by 'bringing water to the thirsty, and with bread meeting the fugitive'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I took the cup from Jehovah's hand and made all the nations 
to whom Jehovah sent me drink it - Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings and its princes, to turn them into a desolation; Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all 
his people; all the kings of Tyre and all the kings of Sidon; Dedan and Tema, and Buz, and all who have cut the corners [of their hair] all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the 
kings of Media, and all the kings of the north. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:17-19,%2022,%2023,%2025,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:17-19, 22, 23, 25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also refers to the desolation of the spiritual Church, different elements of which Church are mentioned in order 
and are meant by Jerusalem, the cities of Judah, Egypt, Tyre, Sidon, Dedan, Tema, Buz, Zimri, Elam, and Media. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Sheba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, and all its young lions 
will say to you, Have you come to seize the spoil? Have you assembled your company to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, and to take cattle and possessions, and seize great spoil? 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Gog who means external worship separated from internal, which is idolatrous, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>. 'Sheba and Dedan' stands for the internal aspects of worship, namely the goods of faith, 
'Tarshish' for corresponding external worship. The silver, gold, cattle, possessions, and spoil which Gog - or external worship separated from the internal - wishes to 'carry away' are the cognitions 
of good and truth, which those who are meant by Sheba and Dedan fight for and defend, and who are on that account called 'young lions'. In the proper sense 'Sheba' is those with whom cognitions of 
good exist, 'sedan' those with whom cognitions of truth derived from good are present. </p>
