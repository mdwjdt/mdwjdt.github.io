<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10309节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10309</strong>.“人若作与它类似的，为要制造它的气味”表源于自我的一种模仿，就是模仿通过对真理和良善的情感所表达的对神的敬拜。这从“作与它类似的”和“制造气味”的含义清楚可知：“作与它类似的”是指模仿对神的敬拜，因为“作”表示模仿，这话所论及的“香”表示对神的敬拜，如前所述；“制造气味”是指产生愉悦之物。由于这一切是通过对真理和良善的情感来实现的，故这些情感就是这种愉悦所表示的；因为“气味”表示对某种宜人之物的感知，因而表示愉悦之物（参看<a href="10292.htm">10292</a>节）。显然，对它的任何模仿都是源于自我，或人自己的东西，因为经上说：“这人要从他民中剪除”。凡来自渴望真理和良善的一种情感的努力，若不是为了真理和良善的缘故，而是为了自我，都源于自我或人自己的东西；为了自我而做事就是为了作为目的的个人利益、重要地位和名声，而不是为了邻舍的拯救或福祉和主的荣耀而做的。因此，这种努力源于邪恶，而非源于良善；或也可说，它源于地狱，而非源于主。所以，这就是“人若作与它类似的，为要制造它的气味”所表示的源于自我的一种模仿，就是模仿通过对真理和良善的情感所表达的对神的敬拜的意思。因此，如此行的，是那些爱世界胜过天堂，爱自己胜过神的人。此外，当这种人暗自在心里思想时，他们根本不信天堂和主；但当他们公开思想时，如他们在世人面前谈论时的情形，就会出于比其他人更强烈的情感和信仰来谈论天堂和主。至于有多么强烈，则取决于他们对个人利益、重要职位和名声所充满的渴望程度。此时他们的状态是这样：他们内心是黑色的，而外表是亮白的，也就是说，他们是具有光明天使形状的魔鬼。因为他们那本应向天堂敞开的内层关闭了，向世界敞开的外层则打开。即便这时他们出于一种似乎属于爱的情感将自己的眼和手举向天堂，仍然像是精心制作以描绘这种姿势的雕像，他们也向天使显为这样的雕像。事实上，你能相信吗？地狱里就有很多这样的人，他们与类似他们的世人同在，并激动这些世人，尤其与那些出于自私的原因通过表达对真理和良善的情感而模仿对神的敬拜的传教士同在。这也是主允许的，因为与此同时，他们也履行一种功用或一种有用的功能；因为善人仍能适当地从他们那里接受圣言。他们能如此行是因为，无论圣言出自谁的口，一个人对圣言的接受都取决于主导这个人的良善的品质。但这些外在的东西纯粹是装样子，所以在来世也会被剥夺；这时，他们的灵就显为黑色，就像它在身体里时那样。</p>

The man who shall make like unto it, to make an odor with it. That this signifies the imitation of Divine worship by means of the affections of truth and good from what is man's own, is evident from 
the signification of "making like it," as being the imitation of Divine worship, for by "making" is signified imitating, and by the "incense" of which this is said, is signified Divine worship, as above; 
and from the signification of "making an odor," as being to please, and as this is done by means of the affections of truth and good, these are what are signified by "pleasing," for "odor" denotes 
the perceptivity of what is grateful, thus what is pleasing (see n. 10292). That it denotes from what is man's own is evident, because it is said, "the man who shall make like unto it shall be cut off 
from his peoples." For that is from man's own which is not from the affection of truth and good for the sake of truth and good, but for the sake of self; and to do anything for the sake of self is to 
do it for the sake of profit, honors, and reputation, as ends; and not for the sake of the salvation of the neighbor and the glory of the Lord; hence it is from evil and not from good; or what is the 
same, it is from hell and not from the Lord. This therefore is what is meant by the imitation of Divine worship by means of the affections of truth and good from what is man's own, which is signified 
by "making incense like unto it, to make an odor with it." Accordingly, those who do this are those who love the world more than heaven, and themselves more than God. Moreover, when such persons think 
inwardly, or by themselves, they do not believe anything about heaven and the Lord; but when they think out of themselves, as is the case when they speak before men, they then speak of heaven and the 
Lord from greater affection and faith than others, and this in proportion as they are inflamed by self-advantage, honors, and reputation. Their state then is that they are inwardly black and outwardly 
white, that is, they are devils in the form of angels of light; for the interiors which should be open to heaven are closed, and the exteriors which are open to the world are open; and if then from 
an affection as it were of love they raise their eyes and hands to heaven, they are nevertheless like effigies made by art, and such they appear to the angels. And if you are willing to believe it, 
there are many such in hell, who are present with and inspire men of like character, especially preachers, who imitate Divine worship by means of affections of truth and good from their own; which also 
is permitted by the Lord, because in this way they too perform a use; for good men nevertheless receive the Word from them well, because from whatever mouth the Word comes, it is received by a man according 
to the quality of his good. But such external things, being pretenses, are stripped off them in the other life; and then their spirit appears black, as it had been in the body. </p>

'The man who makes any like it, to make an odour with it' means an imitation - springing from self - of the worship of God expressed through affections for truth and good. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'making any like it' as imitating the worship of God, for 'making' means imitating, and the incense to which this refers means the worship of God, as above; and from the meaning of 'making an odour' 
as producing what is pleasing. And since this is done through affections for truth and good, these affections are what is meant by such pleasure; for 'odour' means the perception of something enjoyable, 
and so means that which is pleasing, <a href="10292.htm">10292</a>. It is evident that any imitation of this springs from self, for it says that 'he who makes it will be cut off from his people'. The proprium or self 
is the source of any endeavour that springs from an affection which desires truth and good not for their own sake but for a selfish reason; and doing something for a selfish reason implies doing it 
for the sake of personal gain, important positions, and reputation as the ends in view, and not for the sake of the welfare of one's neighbour and the glory of the Lord. Consequently that endeavour springs 
from evil and not from good; or what amounts to the same thing, it springs from hell and not from the Lord. This therefore is what should be understood by an imitation - springing from self - of 
the worship of God expressed through affections for truth and good, meant by 'making an incense like it, to make an odour with it'. The people therefore who do this are those who love the world more 
than heaven, and themselves more than God. Also, when they think secretly within themselves they have no belief at all in heaven nor in the Lord; but when they think openly, as they do when talking in 
the presence of other people, they talk about heaven and the Lord with more emotion and conviction than others express. How much more depends on the degree to which they burn with the desire for personal 
gain, important positions, and reputation. Their condition at this time is such that inwardly they are black and outwardly shining white, that is, they are devils in the shape of angels of light. 
For their interiors which ought to lie exposed to heaven are closed, and their exteriors which lie exposed to the world are open. And if they are moved at this time by an affection that seemingly belongs 
to love to raise their eyes and hands towards heaven, they are nevertheless like statues skillfully made to portray that pose; and they also appear to angels as such statues. Indeed, can you believe 
it, there are in hell very many such as these who are present with and inspire people like them in the world, especially with preachers who for selfish reasons imitate the worship of God by expressing 
affections for truth and good. Furthermore the Lord allows them to act in this way, because at the same time they also perform a useful function; for good people can still receive the Word properly 
from them. They can do so because the reception of the Word by a person, no matter whose mouth it goes out of, depends on the character of the good governing that person. But such externals, being 
mere postures, are stripped away from them in the next life, and then their spirit is shown to be black, as it had been while they were in the body.  </p>

`Vir qui fecerit sicut illud ad faciendum odorem eo': quod significet imitationem cultus Divini per affectiones veri et boni ex proprio, constat ex significatione `facere sicut illud' quod sit imitatio 
cultus Divini, per `facere' enim significatur imitari, et per `suffimentum,' de quo id dicitur, significatur cultus Divinus, ut supra; et ex significatione `facere odorem' quod sit ad placendum, quod 
quia fit per affectiones veri et boni, sunt hae quae per placentiam significantur, `odor' enim est perceptivum grati, ita quod placet, n. 10,292; quod sit ex proprio, patet, nam dicitur, Qui id fecerit, 
exscindetur e populis suis; ex proprio enim est quod non est ex affectione veri et boni propter verum et bonum sed propter semet, et facere propter semet est propter lucrum, honores, et famam ut 
fines, et non propter salutem proximi et gloriam Domini; inde est ex malo et non ex bono, seu quod idem, ex inferno et non ex Domino; hoc itaque est quod intelligitur per imitationem cultus Divini per 
affectiones veri et boni ex proprio, quae significantur per `facere suffimentum sicut illud ad faciendum odorem eo'; qui itaque faciunt sunt qui amant mundum prae caelo, ac semet prae Deo; illi quoque 
cum intus seu secum cogitant, nec credunt aliquid de caelo et de Domino, sed cum cogitant extra se, quod fit cum loquuntur coram hominibus, tunc de caelo et de Domino ex affectione et fide prae aliis 
loquuntur, ac tantum prae aliis, quantum lucra, honores, et fama incendunt. Status eorum tunc est quod interius nigri sint, exterius candidi, hoc est, sunt diaboli in forma angelorum lucis, clausa 
enim sunt interiora, quae paterent ad caelum, et aperta sunt exteriora quae patent ad mundum; et si elevant tunc ex affectione quasi amoris, oculos et manus ad caelum, sunt tamen sicut simulacra ita 
ex arte facta, sicut talia quoque apparent coram angelis; et si credere velitis, sunt tales in inferno plures qui apud homines similes, imprimis apud praedicatores qui imitantur cultum Divinum per affectiones 
veri et boni ex proprio, adsunt, et inspirant; quod etiam a Domino permittitur, quoniam sic etiam usum praestant; boni enim homines usque recipiunt {1}Verbum ex illis bene; quoniam {1}Verbum, 
e cujuscumque ore exeat, recipitur ab homine secundum quale ejus boni. Sed externa talia, quia sunt figmenta, exuuntur illis in altera vita; et tunc apparet spiritus eorum niger qualis fuerat in corpore. @1
