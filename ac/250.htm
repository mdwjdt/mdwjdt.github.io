<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第250节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>250.</strong>创世记3:15 我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇，你的种和女人的种也彼此为仇。女人的种要踹你的头，你要伤他的脚跟。<br />众所周知，这是主要降世的第一个预言。这在文字上就显而易见，故连犹太人，通过该预言并先知书，也知道有一位弥赛亚要降临。只是，“蛇”、“女人”、“蛇的种”、“女人的种”、“伤蛇的头”、“伤女人的脚跟”各是何义，迄今尚无人明了，故需加以解释。<br />在此，“蛇”统表一切恶，特指我欲，“女人”表教会，“蛇的种”表一切不信，“女人的种”表对主的信，“他”表主，“蛇的头”统表恶的辖制，特指我欲的辖制，“踹”表压制，使之“用肚子行走，以尘埃为食”，“脚跟”表属世层的底端，比如肉欲，这是蛇要“伤”的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]250.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_15" target=_top>Genesis 3:15</a>. "And I will put hostility between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will trample you on the head and you will wound him on the heel."<br />It escapes no one today that this is the first prophecy of the Lord's coming into the world. The words themselves make it clear. From this prediction and from the prophets, even Jews know that a messiah will come.{*1} No one yet, however, knows the specific meaning of each part — the snake, the woman, the snake's seed, the woman's seed, the snake's head that he will trample, and the heel that the snake will wound. An explanation, then, is due.<br />The snake refers in general to all evil and particularly to self-love. The woman refers to the church. The snake's seed refers to all unbelief. The woman's seed refers to faith in the Lord. He refers to the Lord himself. The snake's head refers to the tyranny of evil in general and of self-love in particular. Trampling refers to pushing it down until it travels on its belly and eats dirt. The heel refers to what is bottommost on the earthly level, such as an orientation toward the body; this is what the snake is going to wound.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's attitude toward Jews, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259" target=_top>259</a> and the reader's guide, pages 51-55 [NCBSP: Available from Swedenborg Foundation]. Jewish Messianism is based on references in the Hebrew Scriptures to an anointed one (Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ [māšîaḥ], sometimes transliterated in English as Mashiach or Moshiach), such as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/bible_king-james-version_psalms_2_2" target=_top>Psalms 2:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/bible_king-james-version_psalms_18_50" target=_top>18:50</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_1" target=_top>Isaiah 45:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_4_20" target=_top>Lamentations 4:20</a>; and on many prophecies seen as related, such as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_250/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_11_1-16" target=_top>Isaiah 11</a>.

Verse 15. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; He shall trample upon thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel. Everyone is aware that this is the first 
prophecy of the Lord's advent into the world; it appears indeed clearly from the words themselves, and therefore from them and from the prophets even the Jews knew that a Messiah was to come. Hitherto 
however no one has understood what is specifically meant by the "serpent" the "woman" the "serpent's seed" the "woman's seed" the "head of the serpent which was to be trodden upon" and the "heel which 
the serpent should bruise." They must therefore be explained. By the "serpent" is here meant all evil in general, and specifically the love of self; by the "woman" is meant the church; by the "seed 
of the serpent" all infidelity; by the "seed of the woman" faith in the Lord; by "He" the Lord Himself; by the "head of the serpent" the dominion of evil in general, and specifically that of the love 
of self; by to "trample upon" depression, so that it should "go upon the belly and eat dust;" and by the "heel" the lowest natural (as the corporeal), which the serpent should "bruise." </p>

Verse 15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will tread down your head, and you will bruise His heel.  </p>
<p>Nobody today is unaware that this is the 
first prediction concerning the Lord's Coming into the world; indeed it is quite clear from the words themselves. From them and from the Prophets the Jews also know that a Messiah is going to come. But 
nobody as yet knows what the serpent, the woman, the seed of the serpent, the seed of the woman, the head of the serpent which He will tread down, and the heel which the serpent will bruise, are used 
to mean in particular. Therefore these must be explained. 'The serpent' is here used to mean in general all evil, and in particular self-love. 'The woman' is used to mean the Church, 'the seed of the 
serpent 'all faithlessness, 'the seed of the woman' faith in the Lord, 'He' the Lord Himself, 'the head of the serpent' the reign of evil in general, and of self-love in particular. 'Treading down' 
is used to mean forcing down so that it goes on its belly and eats dust, and 'the heel' the lowest part of the natural which is the bodily, which the serpent will bruise.  </p>

Vers. 15.  Et inimicitiam ponam inter te, et inter mulierem; et inter semen tuum, et inter semen ejus; Ille conculcabit tibi caput, et tu laedes Illi calcaneum.  Neminem hodie latet quod haec sit prima 
prophetia de Adventu Domini in mundum; ex ipsis verbis etiam clare constat; inde et ex Prophetis sciunt etiam Judaei quod venturus Messias. Sed nondum quisquam novit quid per serpentem, per mulierem, 
per semen serpentis, per semen mulieris, per caput serpentis quod Ille conculcabit, et per calcaneum quod serpens laesurus, in specie intelligatur, quare haec exponenda.  Per 'serpentem' hic intelligitur 
in genere omne malum, in specie amor sui: per 'mulierem' intelligitur Ecclesia: per 'semen serpentis' omnis infidelitas: per 'semen mulieris' fides in Dominum: per 'Ille' Ipse Dominus: per 'caput 
serpentis' dominium mali in genere, et amoris sui in specie: per 'proculcare' depressio ut ambulet super ventre et edat pulverem: per 'calcaneum' infimum naturale ut corporeum, quod laesurus serpens. </p>
