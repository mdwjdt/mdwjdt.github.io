<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5089节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5089.</strong>“他们有些日子在看守所”表它们很长时间处于被抛弃的状态。这从“日子”的含义清楚可知，“日子”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>节）；故此处“有些日子”表示它们很长时间处于“看守所”所表示的被抛弃状态（<a href="5083.htm">5083</a>节）。在此充分阐明包含在内义中的细节是不可能的，因为它们具有这样的性质：对它们的概念无法在尘世事物的帮助下得以形成，如属灵人的属天层，以及当内层属世层正被变新时，以及后来当它已被变新，并且外层属世层被抛弃时，它在属世层里面的状态。但对这些及类似事物的某种观念能从天堂里的事物获得，这种观念是诸如不会转化为从尘世事物所获得的任何概念中的那类观念，除非人们在思考时能从感官印象被引离。<br />若非人的思维能被提升超越感官印象，以便这些在他下面被看见，他就无法理解圣言中的任何内层事物，更不理解诸如完全从尘世事物抽象出来的天堂事物；因为感官事物吸收并窒息它们。这解释了为何那些依赖感官并热情投入获得知识的人罕有理解有关天堂事物的任何情况；因为他们将自己的思维沉浸于诸如属世界的那类事物，也就是沉浸于从这些所形成的术语和定义中，因而沉浸于感官事物，他们不再能从感官事物被提升，从而被保持在高于感官的观点中。他们的思维也不能自由地延伸到记忆事物的整个领域之上，以便拣选一致的，抛弃相反的，利用凡以任何方式适合之物。因为如前所述，他们的思维被锁起来，沉浸于术语，因而沉浸于感官印象，以致它不能环顾四周。这就是为何学者信得不如简单人，甚至在天堂事物上没有那么敏锐的洞察力的原因。因为简单人能超越术语和纯粹的知识，因而超越感官事物看待事物；而学者无法如此行；而是基于术语和知识来看待一切事物，因为他们的心智沉浸于这些事物，因而可以说被囚在牢里，或监狱里。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5089</b></p><p><b>5089.</b>
And they were for days in custody. That this signifies that they were long in a state of rejection, is evident from the signification of "days," as being states (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 
3462, 3785, 4850); here therefore "for days" means that they were long in the state of rejection which is signified by "custody" (n. 5083). The particulars which are contained in the internal sense cannot 
be here set forth more fully, because they are of such a nature that no idea can be formed of them from the things in this world; as for instance of the celestial of the spiritual man, and of its 
state in the natural when the interior natural is being made new, and afterward, when it has been made new and the exterior natural is rejected. But of these and similar things an idea may be formed 
from the things in heaven, which idea is such that it does not fall into any idea formed from the things in this world, except with those who while in thought can be withdrawn from sensuous things.  [2] 
Unless man's thought can be elevated above sensuous things, so that these are seen as below him, he cannot understand any interior thing in the Word, still less such things as are of heaven abstracted 
from those which are of the world; for sensuous things absorb and suffocate them. It is for this reason that those who are sensuous and have zealously devoted themselves to getting knowledges, rarely 
apprehend anything of the things of heaven; for they have immersed their thoughts in such things as are of the world, that is, in terms and distinctions drawn from these, thus in sensuous things, 
from which they can no longer be elevated and thus kept in a point of view above them; thus neither can their thought be any longer freely extended over the whole field of the things of the memory, so 
as to select what agrees and reject what is in opposition, and apply whatever is in connection; for as already said their thought is kept closed and immersed in terms, and thus in sensuous things, so 
that it cannot look around. This is the reason why the learned believe less than the simple, and are even less wise in heavenly things; for the simple can look at a thing above terms and above mere 
knowledges, thus above sensuous things; whereas the learned cannot do so, but look at everything from terms and knowledges, their mind being fixed in these things, and thus bound as in jail or in prison. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5089</b></p><p><b>5089.</b>
'And they were in custody for days' means that they lay in a state when they were cast aside for a long time. This is clear from the meaning of 'days' as states, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>; so that 'for days' here means lying in a particular state for a long time - in a state when they were cast aside, meant by 'custody', <a href="5083.htm">5083</a>. A more lengthy explanation of the details 
contained in the internal sense here is not possible because they are not the kind of matters about which any idea can be gained with the help of things in the world, such as details about the 
celestial-of-the-spiritual man, about this man's state within the natural when the interior natural is being made new, and after that when it has been made new and the exterior natural has been cast aside. 
But some idea of these matters and others like them can be gained from things in heaven, which is the kind of idea that does not pass into any notion gained from things in the world, except in the 
case of people who, in their thinking, can be led away from sensory impressions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Unless a person's thought can be raised above sensory impressions so that these are beheld as existing so to 
speak beneath him, he cannot possibly discern any interior aspect of the Word, let alone things of heaven such as are totally removed from those of the world, since the senses take hold of them and stifle 
them. This explains why people who rely on their senses and have focused their attention on known facts rarely understand anything about the things of heaven; for they have immersed their thoughts 
in the kinds of things that belong to the world, that is, in terms and in definitions formed from these, and so in what the senses perceive, from which they can no longer be raised up and so preserved 
in a way of looking at things that is higher than the senses. Nor can their thought range freely any longer over the whole field of matters recorded in the memory, selecting those which agree and casting 
aside those which are contrary, and using those which are in any way appropriate. For their thought is locked up and immersed in terms, as has been stated, and consequently in sensory impressions, 
so that it cannot look round about. This is the reason why the learned possess less belief than the simple, and also indeed why they possess less discernment in heavenly matters. For the simple can 
view something from a position that is above mere terms and above known facts, and so above sensory evidence. This the learned cannot do; their viewpoint is based on terms and known facts because their 
mind is immersed in these. Thus they are bound so to speak in a dungeon or prison. </p>

</p><b>5089.</b>
`Et fuerunt diebus in custodia': quod significet quod in statu rejectionis diu essent, constat ex significatione `dierum' quod sint status, de qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850; 
hic itaque `diebus' quod in statu diu, nempe rejectionis, quae per `custodiam' significatur, n. 5083. Singula haec quae in sensu interno continentur, fusius explicare non licet, quia talia sunt 
de quibus formari nequit idea ab illis quae in mundo sunt, sicut de caelesti spiritualis homine, de statu ejus in naturali cum naturale interius novum fit, (c)ac postea cum novum factum ac naturale 
exterius rejectum, sed de his et similibus formari potest idea ab illis quae in caelo, quae talis est ut non cadat in aliquam ideam formatam ab illis quae in mundo, nisi apud illos qui dum in cogitatione 
sunt, abduci a sensualibus 2 possunt; </p>
<p>nisi cogitatio apud hominem elevari {1}potest supra sensualia, sic ut haec spectentur sicut infra, nequaquam sapere potest aliquid interius in Verbo, minus 
talia quae sunt caeli abstracta ab illis quae sunt mundi, sensualia enim absorbent illa et suffocant; inde est quod qui sensuales sunt, et studio incubuerunt scientificis, raro aliquid capiant 
de illis quae sunt caeli; immerserunt enim cogitationes talibus quae sunt mundi, hoc est, terminis et {2}definitionibus ab illis, ita sensualibus, a quibus elevari non amplius possunt, et sic teneri 
in intuitione supra illa; ita nec amplius potest cogitatio eorum libere extendi circum omnem campum rerum memoriae, et eligere quae conveniunt ac rejicere quae repugnant, et applicare quae in aliquo 
nexu sunt; clausa enim et immersa tenetur terminis, ut dictum, et inde sensualibus, ut circumspicere non possit; haec causa est quod eruditi minus credant quam simplices, immo etiam quod in caelestibus 
minus sapiant; </p>
<p>simplices enim intueri rem possunt supra terminos et supra scientifica, ita supra sensualia; eruditi vero non ita, intuentur ex terminis et scientificis, est enim mens in illis, 
ita vincta sicut in claustro seu in carcere. @1 possit$ @2 distinctionibus I$ </p>
