<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第644节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>644.</strong>“房间”表示人的两个部分，即意愿和觉知。这一点从刚才对这两个部分的阐述清楚可知，即意愿和觉知区别显着，彼此分离；还从以下事实清楚可知，如前所述，人的大脑因此被分成两个部分，被称为脑半球。觉知的本能属于左脑，意愿的本能属于右脑。这是最一般的区别。此外，意愿和觉知这二者被划分为无数部分，因为构成人的觉知之物，以及构成人的意愿之物，其划分如此之多，以至于它们永远无法根据广泛的属被描述或列出来，更不说根据种类了。人就象最微型的天堂。他对应于精灵界和天堂，其中构成觉知和意愿之物的一切属和一切种，都被主以最完美的秩序区分和分离，以致每一个最小部分都是截然不同和分离的。对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。在天堂，这些划分的部分被称为社群，在圣言，被称为“居所”，在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.2.htm">14:2</a>）中被主称为“房间（住处）”。然而，在此它们也被称为“房间”，因为它们涉及表示教会成员的方舟。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]644.</strong> The symbolism of the compartments as a person's two sides, that of will and that of intellect, is established by previous statements: there is a clear distinction between the two sides called will and intellect, and the result, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641" target=_top>641</a>], is the division of the human brain into two parts referred to as hemispheres.{*1} Intellectual affairs belong to the left hemisphere and volitional ones to the right. This is the broadest division.<br />Both will and intellect are further divided into parts without number. The concerns of our intellect and the concerns of our will have so many categories that even the general ones could never be labeled or listed, still less the specific ones.<br />A person is like a kind of miniature heaven that corresponds to the world of spirits and heaven, where the Lord draws distinctions among all the genera and species of intellectual and volitional affairs. He divides them up and organizes them so perfectly that even the smallest has its own distinct identity. More on this below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657" target=_top>657</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_675" target=_top>675</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775" target=_top>775</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy.<br />The distinct groupings in heaven are called communities. In the Word they are called dwelling places, and in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/bible_king-james-version_john_14_2" target=_top>John 14:2</a> the Lord calls them places to live. Here they are called compartments, since they were a feature of the ark, which symbolizes a person who is part of the church.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's recognition of the division of functions between the two hemispheres of the brain, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641" target=_top>641</a>.

That by the "mansions" are signified the two parts of man, which are the will and the understanding, is evident from what has been stated before: that these two parts, the will and the understanding, 
are most distinct from each other, and that for this reason, as before said, the human brain is divided into two parts, called hemispheres. To its left hemisphere pertain the intellectual faculties, 
and to the right those of the will. This is the most general distinction. Besides this, both the will and the understanding are distinguished into innumerable parts, for so many are the divisions of the 
intellectual things of man, and so many those of the will, that they can never be described or enumerated even as to the universal genera, still less as to their species. A man is a kind of least heaven, 
corresponding to the world of spirits and to heaven, wherein all the genera and all the species of the things of the understanding and of the will are distinguished by the Lord in the most perfect 
order, so that not even the least of them is undistinguished, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. In heaven these divisions are called Societies, in the Word "habitations" and 
by the Lord "mansions" (John 14:2). Here also they are called "mansions" because they are predicated of the ark, which signifies the man of the church. </p>

'Rooms' means the two parts of man, that of the will and that of the understanding. This is clear from what has been stated about those two parts, will and understanding, being quite distinct and separate 
from each other, and from the fact, as has been stated, that the human brain therefore is divided into two parts called hemispheres. To its left hemisphere belong the powers of the understanding, 
to the right those of the will. This is the most general difference. In addition both will and understanding are divided into countless parts, for the divisions of the things constituting man's understanding, 
and also of those constituting his will, are so many that not even the broad genera, still less the species, can possibly be described or counted up. Man is like some most miniature heaven. 
He corresponds to the world of spirits and to heaven, where all the groups and all the divisions of things constituting the understanding or the will are so distinct and separate, being so perfectly 
ordered by the Lord, that every smallest part is distinct and separate. These considerations in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt with later on. In heaven these divided parts are called communities, 
in the Word 'habitations', and by the Lord in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:2</a> 'rooms'. Here however because they have reference to the ark, which means the member of the Church, they are called 'rooms'. </p>

</p><b>644.</b>
Quod per 'mansiones' significentur binae partes hominis, quae sunt voluntatis et intellectus, constat ex illis quae dicta sunt, quod binae illae partes, voluntas et intellectus, sint inter se distinctissimae, 
et quod ideo, ut dictum, cerebrum humanum in binas partes, quae vocantur hemisphaeria, divisum sit; ad sinistrum ejus hemisphaerium pertinent intellectualia, ad dextrum voluntaria; haec communissima 
est distinctio.  Praeterea tam voluntas quam intellectus in innumerabiles partes distinguuntur, nam tot divisiones intellectualium et tot voluntariorum hominis sunt ut nusquam quoad genera universalia, 
minus quoad species, exprimi aut enumerari possint: homo est sicut quoddam exiguissimum caelum, qui correspondet mundo spirituum et caelo, ubi omnia genera et omnes species intellectualium 
et voluntariorum, ex Domino, ita ordinatissime distincta sunt ut ne quidem omnium minimum sit quod non distinctum; de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. In caelo divisiones illae 
appellantur societates, in Verbo 'habitacula,' a Domino 'mansiones,' Joh. xiv 2; hic autem 'mansiones' quia praedicantur de arca, per quam significantur homo Ecclesiae. </p>
