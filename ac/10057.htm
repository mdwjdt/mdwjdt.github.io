<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10057节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10057</strong>.“你要将第二只公绵羊牵来”表后续状态，就是在天堂里从主的神性良善发出神性真理的状态。这从前后文清楚可知。前面论述的主题是小公牛的祭牲和第一只公绵羊的燔祭；接下来论述的主题是第二只公绵羊和用它充满手；最后论述的主题是小公牛的祭牲和每日所献的羔羊燔祭。人在思考时若还有一点理性，谁看不出这些细节隐藏着天堂的奥秘在里面？否则，具有如此多仪式的祭牲和燔祭还能有其它解释吗？祭坛有必要浸满血吗？血有必要抹在亚伦和他儿子的耳垂、手上的大拇指和脚的大脚趾上，以及他们的衣服上吗？就祭牲而言，肠子、肝和肾上的脂肪，连同肾本身有必要烧在坛上，剩下的则用火烧在营外，或被吃掉吗？就燔祭而言，肠子和腿有必要放在块子和头的上面烧掉吗？第二只绵羊的几个部位有必要在亚伦和他儿子的手掌上摇一摇，而其它部位则被吃掉吗？凡愿意的人，就让他扪心自问，这类要求若不包含神圣的奥秘在里面，岂不纯粹是毫不重要的世俗问题？它们若包含神圣奥秘，就必完全与天堂和教会有关，在至高意义上则与主有关；因为唯独这些是神性，故是神圣的。人们若相信圣言是神圣的，并且在每一个部分上都是受神启发的，也必相信祭牲和燔祭中的每一个惯例都涉及并包含这种奥秘在里面。然而，世人绝无可能知道这些惯例里面涉及并包含什么，除非知道这类事物在天上表示什么。然而，唯独圣言的内义教导所表示的是什么，因为内义揭示对应关系。事实上，存在于自然界中的一切事物都对应于存在于灵界中的事物，因为前者凭后者存在并持续存在。<br />但至于本章所描述的祭牲和燔祭里面包含什么，随着通过内义逐渐揭示出对应关系，这一切将会阐明。就一切神圣事物都是神性的至高意义而言，所论述的主题是主之人身的荣耀；就代表意义而言，所论述的主题则是一个人的重生。关于祭牲和燔祭所吩咐的事充分描述了主之人身得荣耀和一个人重生的实际过程。为叫人们对这一过拥有某种概念，我通过诸如他们的心智能够理解的那类事物来解释它。众所周知，对眼所看见、耳所听见的事物的洞察从内在发生在一个人里面；这些事物可以说经由眼、耳从世界进入思维，由此进入理解力，因为思维属于理解力。它们若是此人所爱的那类事物，就会从那里进入意愿，然后从意愿经由理解力进入口中言语和身体行为。这就是这一切从世界经由内在人进入属灵人，又从那里出来进入世界的循环。然而，要知道，这个循环是从意愿，也就是一个人生命的至内在核心起始的，并且它从那里开始，在它的激励下走完整个过程。一个处于良善的人，其意愿是由主通过天堂来掌管的，尽管表面上看，情况不是这样。流注从灵界进入自然界，从而经由内在人进入外在人，而不是反过来；因为内在人在天堂，而外在人则在世界。<br />这个循环是一个人生命的循环，故在人重生期间，他也照着这个循环重生，或说他的重生照着这个循环行进；当他已经重生时，他的生活和行为就照着它行进，或说他照着它生活和行事。因此，在一个人重生期间，构成其信的真理通过听觉和视觉被逐渐灌输；这些真理被植入其属世人的记忆。然后它们从这记忆转入属于理解力的思维，此人所爱的真理就变成其意愿的一部分。它们在何等程度上成为他意愿的一部分，就在何等程度上成为他生命的一部分，因为人的意愿构成他的实际生命；它们在何等程度上成为他生命的一部分，就在何等程度上成为他情感、因而他意愿里面的仁和理解力里面的信的一部分。之后，由仁和信构成的这生命就成为此人言行的源头，或说，此人从由仁和信构成的这生命说话和行事。他口中的话，以及身体行为从占据其意愿的仁而出来，并且二者都经由其理解力，因而经由其信而来。由此明显可知，一个人重生的循环类似其生命总体上的循环；它同样通过来自天堂并始于主的一种流注而在意愿中开始。<br />由此也明显可知，一个正在重生的人要经历两种状态：第一种是在信之真理正被植入并与仁之良善联结的时候，第二种是在仁之良善通过信之真理掌管他言行的时候。因此，第一种状态是从世界经由属世人进入属灵人，从而进入天堂；第二种状态是从天堂经由属灵人进入属世人，从而进入世界。如前所述，属灵人或内在人在天堂，属世人或外在人在世界。这种循环就是一个人生命的循环，因而是其属灵生命的循环。关于一个正在重生之人所经历的这两种状态，可参看9274节所提到的地方。<br />从前面的说明可以对主之人身的荣耀获得某种概念；因为主怎样荣耀祂的人身，就怎样使人重生；故如前面经常说的，一个人的重生就是主之荣耀的一个形像。由此明显可知，其荣耀的第一种状态就在于将祂的人身作成神性真理，并使它与祂里面的神性良善合一；第二种状态在于出于神性良善通过神性真理行动。因为天堂和教会皆通过从主的神性良善发出的神性真理而得以建立；教会里的所有人都通过这神性真理重生。这些就是本章论述的祭牲和燔祭，以及关于它们的仪式所描述的事。小公牛的祭牲和第一只公绵羊的燔祭用来描述第一种状态；用第二只公绵羊的几个部位“充满手”则用来描述第二种状态；而本章最后提到的小公牛的燔祭和每天所献的燔祭则用来表示这第二种状态的延续。<br />要知道，对一个正在重生的人来说，从邪恶和由此而来的虚假中洁净是不断进行的；因为一个人从邪恶和虚假中洁净到何等程度，信之真理就被植入并与仁之良善联结到何等程度；仁之良善也在何等程度上成为此人行为的源头，或说此人后来就在何等程度上出于仁之良善行动。对人来说，从邪恶和虚假中洁净不是摆脱它们，而是将它们移走或挪走（参看<a href="868.htm">868</a>，<a href="887.htm">887</a>，<a href="894.htm">894</a>，<a href="929.htm">929</a>，<a href="1581.htm">1581</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>，<a href="2406.htm">2406</a>，<a href="4564.htm">4564</a>，<a href="8206.htm">8206</a>，<a href="8393.htm">8393</a>，<a href="8988.htm">8988</a>，<a href="9014.htm">9014</a>，<a href="9333.htm">9333</a>，<a href="9446.htm">9446</a>-<a href="9451.htm">9451</a>，<a href="9938.htm">9938</a>节）。但对主来说，这不是一种移走，而是一种抛弃，就是抛弃祂从母亲那里所获得的东西，从而完全、彻底地摆脱它们，以致祂不再是马利亚的儿子（参看<a href="9315.htm">9315</a>e节所提到的地方）。预先提及这些事，是为了叫人们知道接下来所说的用第二只公绵羊的部位充满手是什么意思。</p>

And thou shalt take the second ram. That this signifies the following state, which is of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from what goes before and what 
follows; in what goes before, the subject treated of was the sacrifices from the bullock, and the burnt-offering from the first ram; in what follows, the subject treated of is the second ram, and the 
filling of the hand by it; and lastly the sacrifice from the bullock, and the daily burnt-offering from lambs. Who cannot see, if he thinks from reason in some measure enlightened, that arcana of heaven 
lie concealed in these details? For otherwise to what purpose would have been the sacrifices and burnt-offerings with so many rituals; as that the altar should be drenched with blood, and that blood 
should be put upon the lap of the ear, the thumb of the hand, and the great toe of the foot, of Aaron and of his sons, and also upon their garments; and that in the sacrifice the fat of the intestines, 
of the liver, and of the kidneys, together with the kidneys themselves, should be burned upon the altar, and the rest should be burned with fire outside the camp, or should be eaten; and in the burnt-offering, 
that the intestines and the legs placed on the pieces and the head should be burned; also that the parts of the second ram should first be waved on the palms of Aaron and his sons, and that 
some parts of it should be eaten. Let anyone who wishes, consider whether such things would not have been merely earthily and of no account if they had not involved holy arcana; and if they involve 
holy arcana, these must of necessity be such as belong to heaven and the church, and in the supreme sense to the Lord, for these alone are holy, because Divine. If there be faith that the Word is holy 
and inspired by the Divine in respect to each and all things, there must also be faith that each and all things that were instituted concerning the sacrifices and burnt-offerings comprehend and contain 
within them such arcana. But what they comprehend and contain within them cannot possibly be known on earth, unless it is known what is signified by such things in the heavens; and what is signified 
the internal sense of the Word alone teaches, because this sense unfolds the correspondences. For all things in the natural world correspond to those in the spiritual world, for the reason that the 
former world comes forth and subsists from the latter. [2] But what the sacrifices and burnt-offerings described in this chapter involve, will be told in a series by unfolding the correspondences by 
means of the internal sense. In the supreme sense, in which all holy things are Divine, the glorification of the Lord's Human is treated of, and in the representative sense the regeneration of man. 
The very process of the glorification of the Lord's Human, and of the regeneration of man, is fully described by the things commanded concerning the sacrifices and burnt-offerings; and in order that this 
process may be apprehended, I may set it forth by means of such things as can fall into the understanding. It is known that what is seen with the eyes and heard with the ears is perceived inwardly 
with man, and as it were passes out of the world through the eyes or ears into the thought, thus into the understanding, for the thought is of the understanding; and if they are such things as are loved, 
they pass from this into the will, and from the will by way of the understanding into the speech of the mouth, and also into the act of the body. Such is the circle of things out of the world through 
the natural man into his spiritual man, and from this again into the world. But be it known that this circle is instituted from the will, which is the inmost of man's life, and that it begins there, 
and is from this accomplished; and the will of a man who is in good is directed from heaven by the Lord, though it appears otherwise. For there is an influx from the spiritual world into the natural, 
thus through the internal man into his external, but not the reverse; for the internal man is in heaven, but the external in the world.  [3] As this circle is the circle of man's life, therefore 
during man's regeneration he is regenerated according to the same, and when he has been regenerated, he lives and acts in accordance with it. Therefore during man's regeneration the truths which are to 
be of faith are insinuated through the hearing and sight, and these truths are implanted in the memory of his natural man. From this memory they are withdrawn into the thought that belongs to the understanding, 
and those which are loved become of the will; and insofar as they become of the will, they become of the life, for the will of man is his very life; and insofar as they become of the life, 
they become of his affection, thus of charity in the will and of faith in the understanding. Afterward the man speaks and acts from this life, which is the life of charity and of faith; from charity 
which is of the will goes forth the speech of the mouth and also the act of the body, both by way of the understanding, thus by the way of faith. From all this it is evident that the circle of the regeneration 
of man is like the circle of his life in general; and that it is in like manner instituted in the will by means of an influx out of heaven from the Lord. [4] Hence also it is plain that there 
are two states in the man who is being regenerated, the first when the truths of faith are being implanted and conjoined with the good of charity, the second when he speaks from the good of charity 
by means of the truths of faith, and acts according to these; thus that the first state is from the world through the natural man into the spiritual, thus into heaven; and the second is from heaven 
through the spiritual man into the natural, thus into the world. As said above, the spiritual or internal man is in heaven, and the natural or external man is in the world. This circle is the circle of 
the regeneration of man, and consequently is the circle of his spiritual life (concerning this twofold state of the man who is being regenerated, see the places cited in n. 9274).  [5] From what has 
been said, some idea may be formed of the glorification of the Lord's Human; for as the Lord glorified His Human, so He regenerates man, and therefore, as already often said, the regeneration of man 
is an image of the glorification of the Lord. From this it is evident that the first state of His glorification was to make His Human Divine truth, and to unite it with the Divine good that was in Him; 
and that the second state was to act from Divine good through Divine truth. For heaven and the church are founded through the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good; and through this 
are regenerated all who are in the church. These are the things described by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and their rituals, that are treated of in this chapter. By the sacrifice from the bullock 
and by the burnt-offering from the first ram is described the first state; and by the fillings of the hand from the second ram is described the second state; and finally by the sacrifice from the 
bullock, and by the burnt-offerings, is signified the continuance of this. [6] Be it known that with a man who is being regenerated, purification from evils and their falsities goes on continually, 
for insofar as a man is purified from evils and falsities, so far are implanted the truths which are of faith, and these are conjoined with the good which is of charity, and insofar the man afterward 
acts from the good of charity. Purification from evils and falsities with man is not liberation from them, but is their removal (see n. 868, 887, 894, 929, 1581, 2269, 2406, 4564, 8206, 8393, 8988, 9014, 
9333, 9446-9451, 9938). But with the Lord there was not removal, but casting out of those things which He derived from the mother, thus full and complete liberation from them, insomuch that He was 
no longer the Son of Mary (see the places cited in n. 9315, at the end). All this has been premised in order that it may be known what is signified by the filling of the hand from the second ram, of 
which in what now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10057</b></p><p><b>10057.</b>
'And you shall take the second ram' means the following state, which is that of Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good in the heavens. This is clear from the things described in what has 
gone before and in what comes after. Those in what has gone before have to do with the sacrifice of the young bull and the burnt offering of the first ram, those in what comes after with the second ram 
and 'filling the hand with it', and finally with the sacrifice of a young bull and the daily burnt offering of lambs. Is there anyone at all rational in his thinking who does not see that these things 
in every detail have heavenly arcana lying within them? What other explanation could there be for the sacrifices and burnt offerings with so many ritual requirements? Why else was it necessary that 
the altar should be flooded with blood; that blood should be put on the tip of the ear, on the thumb, and on the big toe of Aaron and his sons, and also [sprinkled] over their garments; that in the case 
of the sacrifice the fat on the intestines, liver, and kidneys, and the kidneys themselves, should be burned on the altar (and all other parts burned with fire outside the camp, or else be eaten), 
and that in the case of the burnt offering the intestines and legs should be placed on top of the pieces and the head and burned on the altar; and also that the parts which were taken from the second 
ram should first be waved on the palms of Aaron and his sons, and that the other parts of it should be eaten? Let anyone who is willing to do so ask himself, Would not such requirements be earthly matters 
of no importance at all if they did not hold holy arcana within them? And if they are holy arcana, they must be altogether such as have to do with heaven and the Church, and in the highest sense 
such as have to do with the Lord; for these alone, being Divine, are holy. If people believe that the Word is holy and has been inspired by God in every single part, they must also believe that every 
single established practice in the sacrifices and burnt offerings embraces and contains such arcana within it. Yet what it is that those practices embrace and contain within them cannot by any means 
be known on earth unless it is known what is meant in heaven by such things. What is meant, however, the internal sense of the Word alone teaches, since this unfolds correspondences. For all things that 
exist in the natural world correspond to those which exist in the spiritual world, because the former comes into being from and is held in being by the latter.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But what the sacrifices and burnt 
offerings described in the present chapter hold within them will be stated in the course of unfolding correspondences by means of the internal sense. The subject in the highest sense, in which all 
holy things are Divine, is the glorification of the Lord's Human, and in the representative sense it is the regeneration of a person. The actual process by which the Lord's Human was glorified and a 
person is regenerated is described fully by means of the things that were commanded regarding the sacrifices and burnt offerings. So that people may have some conception of that process let other things 
which their minds are capable of understanding serve to explain it. It is well known that the discernment of things seen with the eyes and heard by the ears takes place inwardly in a person; those 
things pass so to speak from the world by way of the eyes or ears into thought, and so into the understanding since thought belongs to the understanding. And if they are the kinds of things the person 
loves they pass from there into the will, and then from the will by way of the understanding into words spoken by the mouth and also into actions performed by the body. Such is the cycle in all this, 
passing from the world by way of the natural man into the spiritual man, and going out from there into the world again. Yet it should be remembered that this cycle is started off by the will, which 
is the inmost core of a person's life, and that it begins there and is inspired by it to run its full course. The will of a person in whom good is present is governed from heaven by the Lord, though the 
situation appears to be other than this. Influx takes place from the spiritual world into the natural world, thus through the internal man into the external man, but not the other way round; for the 
internal man is in heaven, whereas the external man is in the world.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This cycle is the cycle of a person's life, and therefore when someone is being regenerated his regeneration proceeds in 
accord with that same cycle; and when he has been regenerated his life and actions proceed in accord with it. Consequently, while a person is being regenerated the truths which will compose his faith 
are instilled through hearing and sight; they are implanted in the memory belonging to his natural man. Then they are transferred from the memory into thought belonging to the understanding, and those 
which the person loves become part of his will. To the extent that they become part of his will they become part of his life, since a person's will constitutes his actual life; and to the extent that 
they become part of his life they become part of his affection, and so of charity in his will and of faith in his understanding. That life, which consists of charity and faith, then becomes the source 
of the person's words and actions. Out of the charity which occupies his will come the words he speaks with his mouth as well as the actions he performs with his body; and both come by way of his understanding, 
thus by way of his faith. From all this it is clear that the cycle of a person's regeneration is akin to the cycle of his life in general, and that it is in like manner started off in the 
will by an influx coming from heaven and beginning in the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this also it is evident that there are two states that a person undergoing regeneration experiences, the first being a time 
when the truths of faith are being implanted and joined to the good of charity, the second a time when the good of charity through the truths of faith governs what he says and how he acts. The first 
state is accordingly one that goes from the world by way of the natural man into the spiritual man, thus into heaven, and the second from heaven by way of the spiritual man into the natural man, thus 
into the world. The spiritual or internal man, as has been stated above, is in heaven, and the natural or external man is in the world. This cycle is the cycle of a person's regeneration, and therefore 
is the cycle of his spiritual life. Regarding those two states of a person who is being regenerated, see the places referred to in <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From what has been stated people may gain some idea 
of the glorification of the Lord's Human; for as the Lord glorified His Human, so He regenerates a person, and therefore, as has already been stated a number of times, the regeneration of a person is 
an image of the Lord's glorification. From this it is evident that the first state of His glorification consisted in making His Human Divine Truth and uniting it to the Divine Good that was within Him, 
and that the second state consisted in acting from Divine Good through Divine Truth. For by means of Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good heaven is built and the Church is built, and by 
means of Divine Truth all within the Church are regenerated. These matters are what the sacrifices, burnt offerings, and their ritual observances spoken of in the present chapter serve to describe. 
The sacrifice of the young bull and the burnt offering of the first ram serve to describe the first state, and 'the fillings of the hand' with parts of the second ram the second state, while the sacrifice 
of the young bull and the daily burnt offering of lambs mentioned last in the chapter serve to mean the continuation of that second state.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 It should be remembered that purification from evils 
and consequent falsities in the case of a person who is being regenerated goes on unceasingly; for to the extent that a person is purified from evils and falsities the truths of faith are implanted 
and joined to the good of charity and the good of charity becomes the source of the person's actions. Purification from evils and falsities in man's case is not a deliverance from them; rather it is 
a removal or moving away of them, see <a href="868.htm">868</a>, <a href="887.htm">887</a>, <a href="894.htm">894</a>, <a href="929.htm">929</a>, <a href="1581.htm">1581</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>, <a href="2406.htm">2406</a>, <a href="4564.htm">4564</a>, <a href="8206.htm">8206</a>, <a href="8393.htm">8393</a>, <a href="8988.htm">8988</a>, <a href="9014.htm">9014</a>, <a href="9333.htm">9333</a>, <a href="9446.htm">9446</a>-<a href="9451.htm">9451</a>, <a href="9938.htm">9938</a>. In the Lord's case however it was not a removal but a casting out of 
those which He had derived from His mother, thus a complete deliverance from them, so complete that He was no longer Mary's son, see the places referred to in <a href="9315.htm">9315</a>(end).  These matters have been mentioned 
by way of introduction in order that people may know what is meant by filling the hand with parts of the second ram, spoken of in what follows immediately below.  </p>

Humani Domini (c)ac regenerationis hominis, plene per illa quae de sacrificiis et holocaustis mandata sunt describuntur; qui processus ut capiatur, illum exponere licet {13} per talia quae cadere 
possunt in intellectum; notum est quod visa oculis et audita auribus appercipiantur intus apud hominem, et quasi transeant e mundo per oculos aut per aures in cogitationem, ita in intellectum, nam cogitatio 
est intellectus; et si talia sunt quae amantur, inde transeunt in voluntatem, ac dein e voluntate per viam intellectualem {14} in loquelam oris, et quoque {15} in actum corporis; talis circulus 
rerum est e mundo per naturalem hominem in ejus spiritualem, et ab hoc iterum in mundum; sed sciendum est quod circulus ille instituatur ex voluntate, quae est intimum (o)vitae hominis, et quod ibi incohet, 
et inde peragatur, et voluntas hominis qui in bono est regitur e caelo a Domino, tametsi aliter apparet; est enim influxus e spirituali mundo in naturalem, (o)ita per internum hominem in ejus

et cum regeneratus est, secundum eundem vivit et agit; quapropter, cum regeneratur homo, per auditum et visum insinuantur vera quae fidei erunt, ac illa implantantur memoriae (o)naturalis ejus (o)hominis, 
e memoria (o)illa subducuntur in cogitationem quae intellectus, et quae amantur fiunt voluntatis; et quantum fiunt voluntatis, tantum fiunt vitae, nam voluntas hominis est ipsa vita ejus, et 
quantum fiunt vitae, tantum fiunt affectionis ejus, ita charitatis in voluntate, et {17} fidei in intellectu; postea homo ex illa vita, quae est vita charitatis et fidei, loquitur et agit, ex charitate 
quae est voluntatis exit loquela oris, et quoque actus corporis, utrumque per viam intellectualem, ita per viam fidei; ex his {18} constat quod circulus regenerationis hominis sit similis circulo vitae 
ejus in communi, et quod ille similiter instituatur in voluntate per influxum e caelo a Domino. 	[4] Inde (o)quoque patet quod bini status sint homini qui regeneratur, primus cum implantantur vera 
fidei et conjunguntur bono charitatis, alter cum ex bono charitatis per vera fidei loquitur et secundum illa agit; sic quod primus status sit e mundo per naturalem hominem in spiritualem, ita in caelum, 
et alter e caelo per spiritualem hominem in naturalem, ita in mundum; {19} spiritualis seu internus homo est, (o)ut supra dictum est, in caelo, ac naturalis seu externus homo {20} in mundo; hic circulus 
est circulus regenerationis hominis, et inde est circulus vitae spiritualis ejus; de bino illo statu hominis qui regeneratur, videantur citata n. 9274. 	[5] Ex dictis aliqua idea (t)capi potest 
de glorificatione Humani Domini, nam sicut Dominus glorificavit Humanum Suum, ita {21} regenerat hominem, quapropter, ut prius (o)aliquoties dictum est, regeneratio hominis est imago glorificationis 
Domini; inde patet quod primus status glorificationis Ipsius fuerit Humanum Suum Divinum Verum facere, (c)et unire illud cum Divino Bono quod in Ipso, et quod alter status fuerit ex Divino Bono agere 
{22} per Divinum Verum, nam per Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino Bono Domini {23} conditur caelum et conditur Ecclesia, et per illud omnes qui in Ecclesia regenerantur.  Haec sunt quae per sacrificia 
et holocausta, et eorum ritualia, de quibus in hoc capite, describuntur; per sacrificium ex juvenco et per holocaustum ex primo ariete, primus status, et per impletiones manus ex secundo ariete secundus 
status; et tandem per sacrificium ex juvenco {24}, et per holocausta quotidiana ex agnis significatur continuum ejus. 	[6] Sciendum est quod apud hominem qui regeneratur, purificatio a malis et 
(o)inde falsis continue perstet, nam quantum homo a malis et falsis purificatur, tantum implantantur vera quae fidei, et haec conjunguntur bono (o)quod charitatis, et tantum dein (o)homo ex bono charitatis 
agit; purificatio a malis et falsis apud hominem non est liberatio ab illis, sed est remotio eorum, (o)videatur (m)n. 868, 887, 894, 929, 1581, 2269, 2406, 4564, 8206, 8393, 8988, 9014, 9333, 9446-9451, 
9938.(n)  Ast apud Dominum non fuit remotio, sed ejectio eorum quae ex matre {25} traxit, ita plenaria liberatio ab illis, (o)usque adeo ut non amplius filius Mariae esset, videantur citata 
n. 9315 fin.  Haec praemissa sunt ut sciatur quid significatur per impletionem manus ex secundo ariete, de quo nunc sequitur. @1 sacrificio$ @2 i et de holocausto,$ @3 ex illo$ @4 si$ @5 forent$ @6
