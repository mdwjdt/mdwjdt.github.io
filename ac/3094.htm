<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3094节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3094.</strong>“就说，我再为你的骆驼打水，直到它们喝足了”表属世人里面一切记忆知识的启示方面的肯定答复。这从“骆驼”和“打”，即“打水”的含义清楚可知：“骆驼”是指属世人里面的一般记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>节）；“打”，也就是说“打水”是指教导和启示（参看<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>节）。显然，这是一个肯定答复，因为她说，她会这么做，并且也这么做了，也就是说，她为骆驼打了水。此处论述的主题是启示，启示出自真理这一方；而事实上，它藉由真理出自良善。至于属世人里面记忆知识的启示，情况乃是这样：一切启示皆来自良善，因为被爱所点燃的良善好比太阳的火焰，热和光便来自这火。而真理则好比一个物体，这火通过该物体而闪耀发光，启示就出自这光。不过，由此而来的光如何，启示就如何。<br />除了真理，没有什么东西会接受良善。不过，真理如何，接受就如何，因而启示就如何。故当启示藉由真理而来时，这启示看似来自真理，仿佛是由真理带来的。而事实上，它是由良善带来的，因为如所描述的，良善藉由真理发光。藉由真理来自良善的启示还会进一步渗透，带来更深的影响，并产生一种低级的真理情感，这种情感稍后会有所论述。天堂之光藉由主的神圣真理从主的神圣良善流出；并且在主的人性中，它藉由神圣真理而来，故不仅抵达属天之人，还抵达属灵之人，以智慧和聪明启示在天堂的所有人。这就是智慧和聪明的源头，因此，圣言的内义大量论述了主人性中的神圣良善和神圣真理。目前，内义就论述了来自良善的真理和藉由真理的良善之最初启示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3094</b></p><p><b>3094.</b>
And she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. That this signifies reciprocation as to the enlightenment of all the memory-knowledges in the natural man is evident from 
the signification of "camels" as being general memory-knowledges in the natural man (see n. 3048, 3071); and from the signification of "drawing," that is, "drawing water," as being to instruct and also 
to enlighten (see n. 3058, 3071). It is evident that this is reciprocation because she said that she would do this, and also did it; that is, drew water for the camels.  The enlightenment that is 
here treated of is on the part of truth, although it is from good through truth. As regards the enlightenment of memory-knowledges in the natural man the case is this: All enlightenment is from good; 
for the good which is of love is comparatively as the sun's flame, from which are heat and light; but truth is as the object through which the flame shines, by which there is enlightenment from light; 
and such as is the light therefrom, such is the enlightenment.  [2] There is nothing else that receives good but truth, and such as is the truth, such is the reception, and such is the consequent enlightenment. 
When therefore there is enlightenment by means of truth, the enlightenment appears to be from the truth, as if it were its own; although it is of good, which thus gives light through the 
truth. Moreover the enlightenment of good by means of truth penetrates still further, and affects more deeply, and produces a lower affection of truth, which will be spoken of presently. The light of 
heaven is from the Divine good of the Lord through His Divine truth; and because it is through the Divine truth in His Human, it penetrates not only to those who are celestial, but also to the spiritual, 
and enlightens with wisdom and intelligence all who are in heaven. And because this is the source of wisdom and intelligence, therefore the Divine good and the Divine truth in the Lord's Human are 
so much treated of in the internal sense of the Word; and in the present passage, this sense treats of the first enlightenment of truth from good, and of good through truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3094</b></p><p><b>3094.</b>
'And said, I will draw for your camels also until they have finished drinking' means the affirmative response as regards the enlightenment of all facts within the natural man. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'camels' as general facts in the natural man, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, and from the meaning of 'drawing', that is to say, drawing water, as giving instruction and also enlightening, dealt 
with in <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>. It is evident that an affirmative response is meant from the consideration that she said what she intended to do and then did it, that is to say, she drew water for the camels. The 
enlightenment which is the subject here comes from the part where truth is, though in fact it comes from good by way of truth. As regards the enlightenment of facts in the natural man, the source of 
all that enlightenment is good, for good which is fired by love may be compared to the flame of the sun, from which flame warmth and light are received, while truth may be compared to an object through 
which the flame shines as light, and from that light comes enlightenment. But as is the light from that source, so is the enlightenment. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nothing else exists to receive good except truth; but 
as is the truth so is the reception, and so consequently the enlightenment. When therefore enlightenment comes by way of truth, the enlightenment from truth in that case appears to be attributable to 
truth, though in fact it is attributable to the good which is shining, as described, through the truth. Enlightenment from good by way of truth also penetrates further and affects more deeply, and it 
produces that lower affection for truth to be dealt with shortly. The light of heaven flows from the Lord's Divine Good by way of His Divine Truth. And because it comes by way of the Divine Truth in His 
Human it reaches not only celestial people but also spiritual, and enlightens all who are in heaven with wisdom and intelligence. This being the source of these, the internal sense of the Word therefore 
deals so much with Divine Good and Divine Truth within the Lord's Human. In the present context it deals with the initial enlightenment of truth from good and of good by means of truth. </p>

`Et dixit, Etiam camelis tuis hauriam usque dum absolverint bibere': quod significet reciprocum quoad illustrationem omnium scientificorum in naturali homine, constat a significatione `camelorum' quod 
sint scientifica communia in naturali homine, de qua n. 3048, 3071; et ex significatione `haurire' nempe aquam, quod sit instruere et quoque illustrare, de qua n. 3058, 3071; quod reciprocum sit, patet 
quia illa dixit quod faceret, et quoque fecit, nempe `hausit aquam camelis.' illustratio, de qua hic agitur, est a parte veri, tametsi a bono per verum: cum illustratione scientificorum in naturali 
homine ita se habet, quod omnis illustratio sit ex bono, nam bonum quod est amoris est comparative sicut solis flamma, ex qua calor et lux, verum autem est sicut objectum, {1}per quod flamma pellucet, 
inde a luce illustratio; [2] sed qualis lux inde, talis illustratio: non aliud est quod recipit bonum quam verum{2}, at quale verum {2}, talis est receptio, et talis inde illustratio: quando itaque 
per verum illustratio, tunc apparet illustratio a vero sicut ejus foret, tametsi est boni, quod ita trans verum lucet: illustratio etiam boni per verum penetrat ulterius, et afficit penitius, ac producit 
affectionem veri inferiorem, de qua mox.  Lux caeli est ex Divino Bono Domini per Divinum Verum Ipsius; et quia per Divinum Verum in Humano Ipsius, penetrat non modo ad caelestes sed etiam ad spirituales, 
ac illustrat omnes qui in caelo, sapientia et intelligentia; quae quia inde, ideo de Divino Bono et de Divino Vero in Humano Domini, tantum in sensu interno Verbi agitur; {3}hic loci de prima 
{4}veri a bono ac boni per verum illustratione. @1 pellucidum, flamma per hoc illustrat, at$ @2 i est$ @3 luci$ @4 boni per verum et veri a bono$ </p>
