<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6013节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6013.</strong>“以及他们的小孩子”表连同那些属于纯真的事物。这从“小孩子”的含义清楚可知，“小孩子”是指纯真（参看<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="5608.htm">5608</a>节）。之所以说“连同那些属于纯真的事物”，以及“那些属于仁爱的事物”，是因为没有纯真与仁爱，属灵真理就无法使属世真理前进。事实上，为变得纯正，真理必须从仁爱获得它的本质和生命，仁爱则必须从纯真获得它的本质和生命。因为赋予真理生命的内层事物按以下次序接踵而来：至内在之物是纯真；在此之下是仁爱；最低之物是出于真理或照着真理的仁爱行为。它们之所以按这种次序接踵而来，是因为它们在天上也是如此接踵而来的。至内或第三层天堂是纯真的天堂；中间或第二层天堂是拥有来自至内层天堂的纯真在里面的仁爱之天堂；最低或第一层天堂是拥有来自第二层天堂的仁爱和在这仁爱里面的来自第三层天堂的纯真在里面的真理之天堂。<br />所有这些美德必须以同样的次序存在于人里面，因为就其内层而言，人照着三层天堂的形像被造的。这也是为何一个重生之人就一个个体天堂，或天堂所取的最小形式。但就其外层，尤其肉体而言，他照着世界的形像而被造的，这就是为何古人称人为小宇宙。耳朵照着适合空气和声音的整个性质而被造；眼睛照着适合以太和光的整个性质而被造；舌头照着对液体中所溶解和悬浮的粒子的整个感觉而被造；鼻孔照着对空气中所悬浮的粒子的感觉而被造；触觉照着对冷和热，以及重量的感觉而被造，等等。正如人的外在感官照着自然界的整个形像而被造，属于其理解力和意愿的内在感官则照着天堂的整个形像而被造。它们如此被造是为了作为一个个体的人能像作为一个整体的天堂那样，成为来自主的神性良善的接受者。</p>

And their babes. That this signifies together with those things which are of innocence, is evident from the signification of "babes," as being innocence (see n. 3183, 5608). It is said "with those things 
which are of innocence," also "which are of charity," for the reason that without innocence and charity, natural truth cannot be caused to advance by spiritual truths; for in order that truth may 
be genuine, it must derive its essence and life from charity, and charity from innocence. For the interior things which vivify truth succeed one another in the following order: inmost is innocence; next 
lower is charity; and lowest is work of charity from truth or according to truth. The reason why they succeed one another in this order is that they so succeed one another in the heavens. For the 
inmost or third heaven is the heaven of innocence; the middle or second heaven is the heaven of charity, within which is innocence from the inmost heaven; and the ultimate or first heaven is the heaven 
of truth, within which is charity from the second heaven, and within this is innocence from the third. All these must be in the same order with man, for in respect to his interiors man is formed after 
the image of the three heavens; and therefore a regenerated man is a heaven in particular or in the least form. But in respect to his exteriors, especially the body, he is formed after the image of 
the world, and therefore he was called by the ancients a microcosm. For the ear is formed after the whole nature of air and sound; the eye after the whole nature of ether and light; the tongue after 
the whole sense of the solvent and fluent parts in liquids; the nostrils after the sense of things fluent in the atmosphere; the touch after the sense of cold and heat, also of things of the earth that 
have weight; and so on. As man's external senses are formed after the whole image of the natural world, so his internal senses, which belong to his understanding and will, are formed after the whole 
image of heaven, to the end that every man may be in particular a recipient of Divine good from the Lord, as heaven is in general. </p>

'And their young children' means accompanied by aspects of innocence. This is clear from the meaning of 'young children' as innocence, dealt with in <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, <a href="5608.htm">5608</a>. Natural truth is said to be accompanied 
by aspects of innocence, and also those of charity, for the reason that if it lacks innocence and charity spiritual truths cannot cause it to move ahead. For to be genuine, truth must derive its essence 
and life from charity, and charity must derive its essence and life from innocence. Indeed these inner virtues which give truth its life follow one another in this order: What is inmost is innocence; 
below this comes charity; and what is lowest is a charitable deed motivated by or done in conformity with truth. The reason why they follow one another in this way is that they follow one another 
in heaven in that order. The inmost or third heaven is the heaven of innocence; the middle or second heaven is the heaven of charity that has innocence from the inmost heaven within it; and the lowest 
or first heaven is the heaven of truth that has charity from the second heaven within it, and innocence from the third within that charity. </p>

 These virtues ought to exist in the same order in man, 
for interiorly the human being is so created that he conforms to an image of the three heavens. This also is why a person who has been regenerated is an individual heaven or the smallest form heaven 
can take. But exteriorly, especially so far as his body is concerned, he is so created that he conforms to an image of the world, which was why the ancients called him the microcosm. The ear has been 
made to conform to the whole nature of air and sound; the eye to conform to the whole nature of the ether and light; the tongue to every perception of particles dissolved and suspended in fluids; the 
nostrils to the perception of particles suspended in the atmosphere; touch to the perception of cold and heat, and also of weights; and so on. Just as a person's external senses conform to an entire 
image of the natural world, so his internal senses, which are those of his understanding and will, have been so created that they conform to an entire image of heaven. They have been created like this 
so that the human being as an individual, like heaven as a general whole, may be a recipient of Divine Good from the Lord. </p>

`Et infantes suos':  quod significet una cum illis quae innocentiae, constat ex significatione `infantum' quod sit innocentia, de qua n. 3183, 5608; cum illis quae sunt innocentiae, tum quae charitatis, 
{1}dicitur, ex causa quia absque innocentia et charitate non potest verum naturale promoveri a veris spiritualibus, verum enim ut genuinum sit, ex charitate, et haec ab innocentia, trahet suam essentiam 
et vitam; succedunt enim interiora quae vivificant verum hoc ordine, intimum est innocentia, {2}inferius est charitas, et {3}infimum est opus charitatis ex vero seu secundum verum; quod ita succedant, 
est quia in caelis ita succedunt; intimum enim seu tertium caelum est caelum innocentiae, medium seu secundum caelum est caelum charitatis in qua innocentia a caelo intimo, et ultimum seu primum 
(t)caelum est veri in quo {4}charitas ex secundo caelo, et in hoc innocentia a tertio; [2]haec in eodem ordine erunt apud hominem, nam homo quoad interiora est ad imaginem trium caelorum formatus; 
inde etiam homo regeneratus est caelum in particulari seu in minima forma; at quoad exteriora, {5} imprimis quoad corpus, est {6}formatus ad imaginem mundi, quapropter ab antiquis vocatus est microcosmus; 
auris enim formata est ad omnem naturam aeris et soni; oculos ad omnem aetheris et lucis, lingua ad omnem sensum partium solutarum et fluentium in liquidis, nares ad sensum partium fluentium in 
atmosphaera; (m)tactus ad {7}sensum frigoris et caloris, tum gravium terrae,(n) {8}et sic porro; sicut sensus externi hominis sunt ad omnem imaginem mundi naturalis, ita {9}sensus interni ejus, qui sunt 
ejus intellectus et voluntatis, formati sunt ad omnem imaginem caeli ob finem ut homo in particulari sit recipiens {10} Divini Boni a Domino, sicut caelum est in communi. @1 before tum$ @2 interius$ @3
