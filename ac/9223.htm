<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9223.</strong>“你要献上你五谷的初熟<br />之物和酒的初熟之物，不可迟延”表由于信的一切良善和真理皆来自主，所以要把它们归于主，不可归于自己。这从“初熟之物”、“五谷”、“酒”和“不可迟延”的含义清楚可知：“初熟之物”是指那些必须占据首位的事物，因而是指那些要为首的事物，如下文所述；“五谷”是指信之真理的良善（参看<a href="5295.htm">5295</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5959.htm">5959</a>节）；“酒”是指良善之真理，因而是指信的良善之真理（<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>节）；“不可迟延”当论及信之良善和真理时，是指出于情感归于，因为凡不是迟迟，而是快速所行的，都是出于爱和情感来行的（<a href="7695.htm">7695</a>，<a href="7866.htm">7866</a>节）。之所以表示归于主，是因为初熟之物，以及头生的，都被归给耶和华，并被耶和华归给亚伦和他的种；在圣言中，“耶和华”表示主（<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="6956.htm">6956</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>，<a href="8864.htm">8864</a>节）。因此，由于“五谷和酒的初熟之物”是指信之良善和真理，故意思是说，它们要归于主，因为它们来自主。构成人的思维和意愿的一切都是流入的，一切良善和真理皆来自主（参看<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2888.htm">2888</a>，<a href="3142.htm">3142</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="4151.htm">4151</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="5119.htm">5119</a>，<a href="5147.htm">5147</a>，<a href="5150.htm">5150</a>，<a href="5259.htm">5259</a>，<a href="5482.htm">5482</a>，<a href="5649.htm">5649</a>，<a href="5779.htm">5779</a>，<a href="5854.htm">5854</a>，<a href="5893.htm">5893</a>，<a href="6027.htm">6027</a>，<a href="6982.htm">6982</a>，<a href="6985.htm">6985</a>，<a href="6996.htm">6996</a>，<a href="7004.htm">7004</a>，<a href="7055.htm">7055</a>，<a href="7056.htm">7056</a>，<a href="7058.htm">7058</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>，<a href="7343.htm">7343</a>，<a href="8321.htm">8321</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>，<a href="8717.htm">8717</a>，<a href="8728.htm">8728</a>，<a href="8823.htm">8823</a>，<a href="8863.htm">8863</a>，<a href="9110.htm">9110</a>节）；这些真理来自经历（<a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>，<a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>，<a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6327.htm">6327</a>，<a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>节）。<br />要献给主的初熟之物是收割季的初熟之物和酿榨季的初熟之物，以及剪羊毛时的初熟之物，同样是水果的初熟之物。收割季的初熟之物是又干又新鲜的谷穗，以及要被摇动的禾捆，后来禾场上的产物，也就是糕饼；而酿榨季的初熟之物是酒、葡萄汁和油的初熟之物。除此之外还有剪羊毛时的初熟之物，以及装在筐子里献上的水果的初熟之物。另外，一切头生的都要献给主；只是其中，头生的人被救赎了，未献为祭的头生动物也被救赎了，如头生的驴、骡、马等等。初熟之物和头生的都献给耶和华，被耶和华交给亚伦和他的种，因为以大祭司的职分来服事的亚伦和他的儿子代表主。在本节，“五谷和酒的初熟之物”是指刚才所提到的收割季和酿榨季的一切初熟之物。因为原文所用的词语是“五谷的丰满”和“酒之泪”；“丰满”是指成熟并收割时的庄稼，“泪”是指滴落下来的液体。当以内义来观之时，从其初熟之物被献上的这几种产物可以看出初熟之物具体代表什么，因为主吩咐给以色列人的一切宗教律例和仪式皆代表教会的内在事物。“五谷”表示信之良善，“酒”表示信之真理，这一点可见于前面所提到的章节。将初熟之物交给耶和华表示，将信的一切良善和真理都归于主，而不是归于自己是教会首先要做的事。将它们归于主就是知道、承认并相信这些事物来自主，决非来自自己；因为如前所示，信完全来自主。“初熟之物”之所以具有这种含义，是因为它们是供物和礼物，是对大地出产的感谢，也是对来自耶和华，也就是主的赐福的承认，因而是对一切事物皆来自祂的承认。就内义而言，它们是对其初熟之物被给出的收成、五谷、葡萄汁、酒、羊毛和水果所表示的信的一切良善和真理皆源于主的承认（关于这些初熟之物，可参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.19.htm">23:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.26.htm">34:26</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.10.htm">23:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.20.htm">20</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.19.htm">15:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.12.htm">18:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.13.htm">13</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申18.4.htm">18:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.1.htm">26:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.11.htm">11</a>）。以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.40.htm">20:40</a>）和弥迦书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.1.htm">7:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.2.htm">2</a>）中的“初熟之物”所表相同。</p>

The firstfruits of thy grain, and the firstfruits of thy wine, thou shalt not delay. That this signifies that as all the goods and truths of faith are from the Lord, they are to be ascribed to Him and 
not to self, is evident from the signification of "the firstfruits," as being those things which must be in the first place, thus those which are to be chief of all (of which below); from the signification 
of "grain," as being the good of the truth of faith (see n. 5295, 5410, 5959); from the signification of "wine," as being the truth of good, thus, the truth of the goad of faith (n. 1798, 6377); 
and from the signification of "not delaying," when said of the good and truth of faith, as being to ascribe from affection; for that which is not done tardily, but quickly, is done from the affection 
of love (n. 7695, 7866). That ascription to the Lord is meant, is because the firstfruits, as well as the firstborn, were given to Jehovah, and by Jehovah to Aaron and his seed; and by "Jehovah" in 
the Word is meant the Lord (n. 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303, 6945, 6956, 8274, 8864). Wherefore, as "the first fruits of the grain and wine" denote the goods and truths of faith, it is meant that 
these are to be ascribed to the Lord, because they are from Him. (That everything of thought and of will with man flows in, and that all good and truth are from the Lord, see n. 2886- 2888, 3142, 3147, 
4151, 4249, 5119, 5147, 5150, 5259, 5482, 5649, 5779, 5854, 5893, 6027, 6982, 6985, 6996, 7004, 7055, 7056, 7058, 7270, 7343, 8321, 8685, 8701, 8717, 8728, 8823, 8863, 9110; and the same from experience, 
n. 6053-6058, 6189- 6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6598-6626.) [2] The firstfruits which were to be offered to the Lord, were the firstfruits of the harvest and the firstfruits of the vintage, 
also the firstfruits of shearing, and likewise the firstfruits of fruit. The firstfruits of the harvest were ears of corn, parched and green, also the sheaf which was to be waved, and afterward the firstfruits 
from the threshing floor, which were cakes; but the firstfruits of the vintage were the firstfruits of wine, of must, and of oil; and besides these there were the firstfruits of the sheep-shearing 
and also the firstfruits of fruit, which were offered in a basket. Moreover, all the firstborn also were offered to the Lord, of which were redeemed the firstborn of men, and also the firstborn 
of those animals which were not offered in the sacrifices, as the firstborn of asses, of mules, of horses, and the like. The firstfruits and the firstborn were offered to Jehovah, and by Jehovah were 
given to Aaron and his seed, for the reason that Aaron and his sons, who administered the office of the high-priesthood, represented the Lord. By "the firstfruits of grain and wine" in this verse are 
meant all the firstfruits of the harvest and the vintage, just now spoken of; for the expressions used in the original tongue are "the fullness of the grain," and "the tear of the wine;" "fullness" denoting 
a harvest ripe and gathered in, and "tears" denoting what is made to drop. [3] What the firstfruits specifically represented (for all the statutes and rituals enjoined upon the sons of Israel 
by the Lord represented internal things of the church), can be seen from the several kinds of produce the firstfruits of which were given, when viewed in the internal sense. That "grain" denotes the 
good of faith, and "wine" the truth of faith, may be seen in the passages above cited. That the firstfruits were to be given to Jehovah, signified that it is the first of the church to ascribe all the 
goods and truths of faith to the Lord, and not to self. To ascribe to the Lord is to know, to acknowledge, and to believe that these things are from the Lord, and nothing of them from self; for as above 
shown, everything of faith is from the Lord. The "firstfruits" have this signification because they were offerings and gifts, which were thanksgivings for the produce of the earth, and an acknowledgment 
of blessings from Jehovah, that is, from the Lord; and consequently were an acknowledgment that all things are from Him; and in the internal sense, an acknowledgment of the goods and truths of 
faith, which are signified by "harvest," by "grain," "oil," "must," "wine," "wool," and "fruits," of which the firstfruits were given. (Concerning these firstfruits, see Exod. 23:19; 34:26; Lev. 23:10, 
11, 20; Num. 15:19-21; 18:12, 13; Deut. 18:4; 26:1-11.) The like is signified by the "firstfruits" in Ezekiel 20:40, and in Micah 7:1, 2. </p>

'[And] you shall not be slow [to offer] the firstfruits of your grain and the firstfruits of your wine' means that since all the good and the truth of faith come from the Lord they are to be ascribed 
to Him, not to self. This is clear from the meaning of 'the firstfruits' as those things which must occupy first place, thus which are the chief of them all, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'grain' 
as the good of the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="5295.htm">5295</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="5959.htm">5959</a>, and from the meaning of 'wine' as the truth of good, thus the truth of the good of faith, dealt with in <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>; and from the 
meaning of 'not being slow', when it has reference to the good and truth of faith, as ascribing from affection, since that which is done not slowly but swiftly is done from love and affection, <a href="7695.htm">7695</a>, <a href="7866.htm">7866</a>. The reason why ascribing to the Lord is meant is that the firstfruits, like the firstborn also, were given to Jehovah, and by Jehovah to Aaron and his seed, 'Jehovah' being used in the Word to mean 
the Lord, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6945.htm">6945</a>, <a href="6956.htm">6956</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, <a href="8864.htm">8864</a>. Consequently since the firstfruits of grain and wine are forms of the good and the truths of faith, the meaning is that they are 
to be ascribed to the Lord since they come from Him. For the truth that everything composing a person's thought and will flows in, and the truth that all goodness and truth come from the Lord, see

 The firstfruits that were to be offered to the Lord were the firstfruits of the harvest and the firstfruits 
of vintage,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> also the firstfruits of shearing, and the firstfruits of fruit too. The firstfruits of the harvest were parched and fresh ears of grain, also a sheaf that was to be waved, and 
afterwards products of the threshing-floor, which were cakes, while the firstfruits of vintage were the firstfruits of wine, must, and oil. In addition to these there were the firstfruits of shearing 
the flock, and also the firstfruits of fruit, which were offered in a basket. In addition also all the firstborn were offered to the Lord, though the firstborn of human beings were redeemed, as also were 
the firstborn of animals that were not offered in sacrifices, such as those of asses, mules, horses, and the like. Firstfruits and firstborn were offered to Jehovah and were given by Jehovah to Aaron 
and his seed because Aaron and his sons, who served in the office of high priest, represented the Lord. In the present verse 'the firstfruits of grain and of wine' is used to mean all the firstfruits 
of harvest and vintage that have been referred to immediately above. For the words used in the original language are 'the fullness of grain' and 'the tear of wine', 'fullness' being the harvest when 
it has ripened and also been gathered in, and 'tears' drops of fluid that trickle down.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What was represented specifically by firstfruits - for all the religious laws and practices which the 
Lord commanded the children of Israel represented internal aspects of the Church - becomes clear when the particular products whose firstfruits were offered are considered in the internal sense. 'Grain' 
means the good of faith and 'wine' the truth of faith, as may be seen in the places referred to above. Giving firstfruits to Jehovah was a sign that the ascription of every good and truth of faith 
to the Lord and not to self was the first thing of the Church. Ascribing them to the Lord consists in knowing, acknowledging, and believing that they spring from the Lord and in no way at all from self; 
for as shown above, faith comes entirely from the Lord. The reason why 'the firstfruits' have this meaning is that firstfruits were offerings and gifts which were thanksgivings for the fruits of the 
earth. They were the acknowledgement of blessings from Jehovah, that is, from the Lord, and therefore the acknowledgement that all things came from Him. In the internal sense they are the acknowledgement 
[that He is the Source] of every good and truth of faith, which are meant by harvest, grain, oil, must, wine, wool, and fruit, whose firstfruits were given. Regarding these 'firstfruits', see Exod.

nam omnia statuta 3 et ritualia mandata filiis Israelis a Domino repraesentabant interna Ecclesiae, constare potest ex singulis ex quibus primitiae dabantur, in sensu interno spectatis; quod `frumentum' 
sit bonum fidei et `vinum' verum fidei, videatur {10}in locis supra citatis.  Quod darentur primitiae Jehovae, significabat quod primum Ecclesiae esset, omnia bona et vera fidei addicare Domino, 
et non sibi; addicare Domino, est scire, agnoscere, et credere quod illa a Domino sint, et nihil eorum a semet, nam, ut supra ostensum est, omne fidei est a Domino.  Quod `primitiae' id significent, 
est quia primitiae erant oblationes et munera quae erant gratiarum {11}actiones pro proventu, et agnitio benedictionum a Jehovah, hoc est, a Domino, proinde agnitio quod omnia ab Ipso; in sensu interno 
agnitio bonorum et verorum fidei, quae {12}significantur per messem, frumentum, oleum, mustum, vinum, lanam, et fructus, ex quibus dabantur primitiae; de `primitiis' illis videatur Exod. xxiii 19, 
xxxiv 26; Lev. xxiii 10, 11, 20; Num. xv 19-21, xviii 12, 13; Deut. xviii 4, xxvi 1-11; simile per `primitias' significatur apud Ezechielem xx 40; et apud Micham vii 1, 2. @1 seu$ @2 i quae$ @3 tum$ @4
