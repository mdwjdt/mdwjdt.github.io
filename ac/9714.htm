<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9714节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9714.</strong>“你要作祭坛”表主和对祂的敬拜的一个代表。这从“祭坛”的含义清楚可知。用于燔祭和祭物的“祭坛”是指主的一个代表；由于“燔祭和祭物”表示构成对主的敬拜的一切，所以祭坛也是对主的敬拜的一个代表。倒不是说通过燔祭和祭物来敬拜主，而是说通过它们所代表的东西，即爱的属天事物和信的属灵事物来敬拜主（参看<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2805.htm">2805</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8680.htm">8680</a>，<a href="8936.htm">8936</a>节）。<br />有两样东西用来代表主的神性人身，即圣殿和祭坛。主自己在约翰福音教导，圣殿代表这人身：<br />耶稣说，你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来。耶稣是指着他身体之殿说的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>）<br />祭坛同样代表这人身，这一点也可从主自己的话看出来，在马太福音，祂论到圣殿，同时论到祭坛说：<br />你们无知、瞎眼，因为你们说，凡指着殿起誓的，这算不得什么。只是凡指着殿中金子起誓的，他就成了欠债的。什么是大的？是金子呢？还是叫金子成圣的殿呢？凡指着坛起誓的，这算不得什么。只是凡指着坛上礼物起誓的，他就成了欠债的。你们无知、瞎眼，什么是大的？是礼物呢？还是叫礼物成圣的坛呢？所以人指着坛起誓，就是指着坛和坛上一切所有的起誓。人指着殿起誓，就是指着殿和那住在殿里的起誓。人指着天起誓，就是指着神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.16.htm">23:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.22.htm">22</a>）<br />由此明显可知，正如殿代表主的神性人身，坛也是如此；论及坛的话与论及殿的话是一样的，即：使坛上的礼物成圣的，是坛。这表明，祭坛是一个渠道，其它事物通过这个渠道而成圣；因此，它也是主的神性人身，就是一切神圣之源头的一个代表。不过，祭坛代表神性良善方面的主；而圣殿则代表神性真理，因而天堂方面的主，因为从主发出的神性真理构成天堂。这解释了为何主论到殿说：“人指着殿起誓，就是指着殿和那住在殿里的起誓”，接着又说：“人指着天起誓，就是指着神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓”。“神的宝座”是指从主发出的神性真理，因而是指天堂；而“那坐在上面的”是指主（<a href="5313.htm">5313</a>节）。圣殿所代表的，也由圣所来代表；那里神性真理方面的主就是柜子里面的“法版”（<a href="9503.htm">9503</a>节）。<br />祭坛因代表神性良善方面的主，故是真正的至圣，并使凡触着它的都成为圣；这一点从下面出埃及记的经文可以看出来，在那里，经上说：<br />要洁净坛七天，使坛成圣，坛就成为至圣。凡触着坛的都成为圣。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.37.htm">29:37</a>）<br />这就是“坛上必有常常烧着的火，不可熄灭”的原因（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.13.htm">6:13</a>）；这火是取自香炉的火，而非来自其它源头（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.6.htm">6</a>）；因为“祭坛的火”表示主的神性之爱的神性良善（<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="6834.htm">6834</a>，<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>节）。<br />祭坛是主的一个代表，这一点从以下诗篇中的经文明显看出来：<br />求你发出你的亮光和真实，好引导我，带我到你的圣山，到你的居所。<br />求你用你的亮光和真理引导我，带我到你的圣山，到你的居所。我就进到神的祭坛，到神那里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.3.htm">43:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.4.htm">4</a>）<br /><br />耶和华啊，我要洗手表明无辜，才环绕你的祭坛。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗26.6.htm">26:6</a>）<br />至于祭坛是对主的敬拜的一个代表，这从下列经文明显看出来：<br />基达的所有羊群都必聚集到你这里，尼拜约的公羊要供你使用；在我坛上必蒙悦纳。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.7.htm">60:7</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />耶和华丢弃自己的祭坛，憎恶自己的圣所。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.7.htm">2:7</a>）<br />“丢弃祭坛”表示废除来自爱之良善的敬拜主的代表；“憎恶圣所”表示废除来自信之真理的敬拜主的代表。<br />以西结书：<br />你们的祭坛必被拆毁，我也要将你们的骸骨抛散在你们祭坛的四围。你们的祭坛必然荒废，变得凄凉，你们的偶像要打碎，不复存在。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.4.htm">6:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“拆毁、荒废、凄凉的祭坛”表示属于代表性敬拜的事物将要如此毁灭。以赛亚书：<br />祂叫祭坛上所有的石头都变为散落灰石的时候，雅各的罪孽才得赦免。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.9.htm">27:9</a>）<br />“散落灰石”表示关于敬拜的一切真理。<br />同一先知书：<br />当那日，人必仰望造他的主，眼目重看以色列的圣者。他必不仰望祭坛，就是自己手所筑的，也不重看自己指头所造的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.7.htm">17:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“自己手所筑、自己指头所造的祭坛”表示出于人自己的聪明的敬拜。<br />何西阿书：<br />以法莲为犯罪增添祭坛。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.11.htm">8:11</a>）<br />“为犯罪增添祭坛”表示发明毫无价值的敬拜形式。<br />荆棘和蒺藜必长在他们的祭坛上。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.8.htm">10:8</a>）<br />这描述了邪恶和虚假将进入并构成敬拜。<br />以赛亚书：<br />当那日，在埃及中间必有为耶和华筑的一座坛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.19.htm">19:19</a>）<br />“为耶和华筑的一座坛”表示对主的敬拜。<br />由于本章所描述的祭坛是轻便可移动的，所以它是用皂荚木造的，并且还包上铜。但在原地永远保持不动的祭坛则是要么用泥土，要么用未凿过的石头筑成的。用泥土所筑的祭坛是出于爱之良善敬拜主的首要代表；而用未凿过的石头所筑的祭坛则是出于信之良善和真理而敬拜的代表（<a href="8935.htm">8935</a>，<a href="8940.htm">8940</a>节）。然而，此处所描述的这种轻便可移动的祭坛是出于爱之良善敬拜主的代表；这就是为何它用皂荚木来作，并包上铜。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9714</b></p><p><b>9714.</b>
And thou shalt make the altar. That this signifies a representative of the Lord and of the worship of Him, is evident from the signification of "the altar which was for burnt- offerings and sacrifices," 
as being a representative of the Lord; and as by "the burnt-offerings and sacrifices" were signified all things of the worship of the Lord, therefore also the altar was a representative of the worship 
of Him. The Lord, however, is not worshiped by means of burnt-offerings and sacrifices, but by means of those things which were represented thereby, which are celestial things of love and spiritual 
things of faith (see n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519, 6905, 8680, 8936). [2] There were two things by which was represented the Lord as to the Divine Human: the temple and the altar. 
That this was represented by the temple, He Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Take apart this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spoke of the temple of His body (John 2:19, 21). That 
the same was represented by the altar can also be seen from His own words when He speaks of the temple and at the same time of the altar, in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Ye fools and blind, because ye say, 
Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is guilty. Which is the greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? Likewise, 
Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. Ye fools and blind; for which is the greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth 
the gift? He that shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by everything that is upon it. And he that shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by Him that dwelleth therein. And he 
that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him that sitteth thereon (Matt. 23:16-22). From this it is evident that, as the temple, so also the altar was a representative of the 
Lord's Divine Human; for the same is said of the altar as of the temple, namely, that it is that which sanctifieth the gift that is upon it; thus that the altar was the subject from which came the sanctification; 
consequently that it also was a representative of the Lord's Divine Human, from which all that is holy proceeds. But the altar was a representative of the Lord in respect to His Divine 
good; whereas the temple was a representative of Him in respect to His Divine truth, thus in respect to heaven; for the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord makes heaven. For this reason it is said 
of the temple that "he that shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it and by Him that dwelleth therein"; and it is added that "he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him 
that sitteth thereon." "The throne of God" denotes the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, thus heaven, and "He that sitteth thereon" denotes the Lord (n. 5313). The same that was represented 
by the temple, was represented also by the Habitation; the Lord in respect to Divine truth being there denoted by "the Testimony" which was in the ark (n. 9503). [3] As the altar represented the Lord 
in respect to Divine good, it was the very holy of holies, and sanctified everything that touched it; as can be seen from what follows in this book, where it is said, "Seven days thou shalt make atonement 
for the altar, and sanctify it; that the altar may be a holy of holies, and everything that shall touch it shall be made holy" (Exod. 29:37); and therefore the fire upon the altar was perpetually 
burning, and was never put out (Lev. 6:13); and from that fire was taken the fire for the incense, and from no other source (Lev. 10:1-6); for by "the fire of the altar" was signified the Divine good 
of the Lord's Divine love (n. 5215, 6314, 6832, 6834, 6849). [4] That the altar was a representative of the Lord, is evident from the following passages in David: </p>
<p>     Let Thy light and Thy truth 
bring me unto the mountain of Thy holiness, and unto Thy habitations, that I may go in unto the altar of God, unto God (Ps. 43:3, 4).      I wash mine hands in innocency; and I compass Thine altar, O 
Jehovah (Ps. 26:6). [5] But that the altar was a representative of the worship of the Lord, is evident from these passages: </p>
<p>     All the flocks of Arabia shall be gathered together to thee; the rams 
of Nebaioth shall minister to thee; they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar (Isa. 60:7).      The Lord hath forsaken His altar, He hath abhorred His sanctuary (Lam. 2:7); </p>
<p>where "to forsake 
the altar" denotes to abolish the representative of the worship of the Lord from the good of love; "to abhor the sanctuary" denotes to abolish the representative of the worship of the Lord from the 
truths of faith. [6] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Your altars shall be destroyed; I will scatter your bones round about your altars; and your altars shall be laid waste, and made desolate; and your idols shall 
be broken, and shall cease (Ezek. 6:5, 6); </p>
<p>"to destroy, lay waste, and desolate the altars" denotes that so it shall be with representative worship. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The iniquity of Jacob shall not be 
expiated, when he shall put all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are scattered (Isa. 27:9); </p>
<p>where "the stones of the altar that are scattered" denote all the truths of worship. [7] Again: </p>
<p> 
    In that day shall a man look unto his Maker, and his eyes unto the Holy One of Israel. And he shall not look unto the altars, the work of his hands, and to that which his fingers have made (Isa. 
17:7, 8); </p>
<p>where "the altars which are the work of his hands and that which his fingers have made" denote worship from one's own intelligence. [8] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Ephraim hath multiplied altars for 
sinning (Hos. 8:11); </p>
<p>where "multiplying altars for sinning" denotes to invent worthless things of worship. In the same: </p>
<p>     The thistle and the thorn shall come up on their altars (Hos. 10:8); </p>
<p>denoting 
that evils and falsities shall enter in and make the worship. [9] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of Egypt (Isa. 19:19); </p>
<p>where "an altar to Jehovah" 
denotes the worship of the Lord. [10] As the altar described in this chapter was portable, it was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with brass; but the altar which was to remain in its place 
was made either of earth or of unhewn stones. The altar made of earth was the principal representative of the worship of the Lord from the good of love; and the altar made of unhewn stones was a representative 
of worship from the goods and truths of faith (n. 8935, 8940); while the portable altar here described was a representative of the worship of the Lord from the good of love. For this reason 
it was of shittim wood and was overlaid with brass. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9714</b></p><p><b>9714.</b>
'And you shall make the altar' means that which was representative of the Lord and of the worship of Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'the altar' - the one to be used for burnt offerings and sacrifices 
- as that which was representative of the Lord; and since the burnt offerings and sacrifices were the signs of all that constituted worship of the Lord, the altar was also representative of the 
worship of Him. Not that the Lord is worshipped with burnt offerings and sacrifices but with what they represented, namely the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith, <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2805.htm">2805</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="8680.htm">8680</a>, <a href="8936.htm">8936</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There were two objects which served to represent the Lord's Divine Human - the temple and the altar. That the temple did so He Himself teaches 
in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again. He was speaking of the temple of His body. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%202:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 2:19-21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>That the altar did so is likewise made clear 
by the Lord's own words, where He speaks in Matthew about the temple and at the same time the altar,  </p>
<blockquote>
Fools and blind! For you say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by 
the gold of the temple, he is guilty. Which of the two is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy? In the same way, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by 
the gift that is on it, he is guilty. Fools and blind! Which of the two is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy? He who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything that is on 
it. And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by Him who sits on it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2023:16-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 23:16-22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is evident 
that just as the temple was representative of the Lord's Divine Human, so too was the altar; for something similar is stated regarding the altar as is stated regarding the temple, namely that the altar 
is what makes the gift on it holy. This shows that the altar was a channel through which other things were rendered holy, and for this reason was also representative of the Lord's Divine Human, the 
Source of all holiness. But the altar was representative of the Lord in respect of His Divine Good, whereas the temple was representative of Him in respect of His Divine Truth, thus in respect of heaven 
since Divine Truth emanating from the Lord makes heaven. This explains why the Lord says in regard to the temple that he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it, and goes 
on to say that he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by Him who sits on it. 'God's throne' is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, and so is heaven, while 'He who sits on it' is the Lord, 
<a href="5313.htm">5313</a>. Much the same as was represented by the temple was represented also by the dwelling-place; the Lord in respect of Divine Truth there is the Testimony which was within the ark, <a href="9503.htm">9503</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Since the altar represented the Lord in respect of Divine Good it was the real holy of holies, making everything that touched it holy, as is made clear later on in this Book of Exodus, where it says, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Seven days you shall make expiation on the altar and sanctify it, that the altar may be most holy,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and all that touches it may be made holy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This was the reason why fire burned unceasingly 
on the altar and was never put out, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:12,13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:12,13</a>; and from this fire and no other source the incense-fire was taken, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2010:1-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 10:1-6</a>. 
</blockquote>
For the fire on the altar was a sign of the Divine Good of 
the Lord's Divine Love, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="6834.htm">6834</a>, <a href="6849.htm">6849</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards the altar and its being representative of the Lord, this is evident from the following words in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Let Your light and truth 
lead me to Your holy mountain and to Your dwellings, that I may go in to the altar of God, to God ... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2043:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 43:3, 4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
I wash my hands in innocence, and I go around Your 
altar, O Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2026:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 26:6, 7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But as regards the altar and its being representative of worship of the Lord, this may be seen in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
All the cattle of Arabia will be gathered to You, 
the rams of Nebaioth will minister to You; they will come up with acceptance on My altar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord has abandoned His altar, He has abominated His sanctuary. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Abandoning the altar' stands for doing away with what was representative of worshipping the Lord from the good of love, 'abominating the sanctuary' stands for doing away with what was representative 
of worshipping the Lord from the truths of faith.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Ezekiel,    Your altars will be destroyed, I will scatter your bones around your altars. Your altars will be laid waste and made desolate, 
and your idols will be broken and cease to be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%206:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 6:4-6</a>.  </p>
<p>'Altars being destroyed, laid waste, and made desolate' stands for the ruination of that which belongs to representative worship. 
In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The iniquity of Jacob will be expiated, when He makes all the stones of the altar like chalk-stones scattered about. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2027:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 27:9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The stones of the altar scattered about' stands for 
all the truths of worship.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that day a person will regard his Maker, and his eyes [will regard] the Holy One of Israel. But he will not regard the altars, the work 
of his hands, and what his fingers have made. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2017:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 17:7, 8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Altars, the work of hands, and what fingers have made' stands for worship that is the product of self-intelligence.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
Ephraim 
has multiplied altars for sinning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%208:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 8:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Multiplying altars for sinning' stands for devising meaningless forms of worship. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Thistle and thorn will grow up 
on their altars. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2010:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 10:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This describes how evils and falsities will come in and compose worship.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In Isaiah,  </p>
<p>On that day there will be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of Egypt. Isa. 
19:19.  </p>
<p>'An altar to Jehovah' stands for worship of the Lord. </p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Because the altar that is the subject here was portable it was made from shittim wood and overlaid with bronze. But an altar that 
was to remain permanently in the same place was built either from soil or from unhewn stones. An altar of soil was the chief representative sign of worship of the Lord that springs from the good of 
love, whereas an altar of unhewn stones was the representative sign of worship springing from forms of the good and of the truth of faith, <a href="8935.htm">8935</a>, <a href="8940.htm">8940</a>. The portable altar however that is the subject 
here was representative of worship of the Lord that springs from the good of love; and this was why it was made from shittim wood and overlaid with bronze.

`Et facies altare': quod significet repraesentativum Domini ac cultus Ipsius, constat ex significatione (x)`altaris' quod pro holocaustis et sacrificiis, quod sit repraesentativum Domini, et quia per 
holocausta et sacrificia significabantur omnia cultus Domini, ideo quoque altare erat {1} repraesentativum cultus Ipsius; sed Dominus non per holocausta et sacrificia sed per illa quae repraesentabantur, 
quae sunt caelestia amoris (c)et spiritualia fidei, colitur, n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519, 6905, 8680, 8936. 	[2] Duo erant per (x)quae Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum repraesentabatur, 
templum et altare; quod per templum, docet Ipse {2} apud Johannem,      	Jesus dixit, Solvite templum hoc, in tribus tamen diebus exsuscitabo illud; Ipse loquebatur de templo corporis Sui, 
ii 19, 20 [, 21]: </p>
<p>quod per altare, etiam ex verbis Domini, ubi de templo et simul de altari loquitur, constare potest {3} apud Matthaeum,      	Stulti et caeci, quia dicitis, Quicumque juraverit per 
templum, nihil est, quicumque vero juraverit per aurum templi, reus est; utrum majus est, aurum an {4} templum quod sanctificat aurum?  Item, quicumque juraverit per altare, nihil est, quicumque vero 
juraverit per donum quod super illo est, reus est; stulti et caeci, utrum majus est, donum an {4} altare quod sanctificat donum? qui juraverit per altare, jurat per illud et per omne {5} quod super illo 
est; et qui juraverit per templum, jurat per illud et per Ipsum Qui habitat in eo; et qui juraverit per caelum, jurat per thronum Dei et per Ipsum Qui sedet super illo, xxiii 16-22; </p>
<p>inde patet quod 
sicut templum, ita quoque altare {6} esset repraesentativum Divini Humani Domini, nam simile de altari dicitur quod de templo, nempe quod id sit quod sanctificat donum quod super eo, ita quod altare 
esset subjectum, (o)a quo sanctificatio, proinde etiam repraesentativum Divini Humani Domini, (o)a quo omne sanctum procedit; sed altare erat repraesentativum Domini {7} quoad Divinum Ipsius {8} Bonum, 
templum autem {9} quoad Divinum (o)Ipsius Verum, ita quoad caelum, nam Divinum Verum procedens a Domino facit caelum; ideo dicitur de templo quod qui juraverit per templum, juret per illud et per 
Ipsum Qui habitat in eo; et additur, qui juraverit per caelum, jurat per thronum Dei et per Ipsum Qui sedet super illo; `thronus Dei' est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, ita caelum et `sedens super 
illo' est Dominus {10}, n. 5313.  Simile quod per templum etiam repraesentabatur per habitaculum; Dominus quoad Divinum Verum ibi est testimonium quod in arca, n. 9503. 	[3] Quia per altare repraesentatus 
est Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, ideo erat illud ipsum sanctum sanctorum, et sanctificabat {11} omne quod tetigit {12} illud, ut constare potest in sequentibus hujus libri, ubi dicitur,      	Septem 
dies expiabis super altare, et sanctificabis illud, ut sit altare sanctum sanctorum, ac omne quod tetigerit illud, sanctificetur Exod. xxix 37; </p>
<p>et ideo ignis super altari perpetuo ardebat, et nusquam 
exstinguebatur, Lev. vi 5, 6 [A. V. 12, 13]; et ex illo igne accipiebatur ignis suffimenti, et non aliunde, Lev. x 1-6; per ignem enim altaris significabatur Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Domini, 
n. 5215, 6314, 6832, 6834, 6849. 	[4] Quod altare fuerit repraesentativum Domini, patet ab his apud Davidem,      	Lux et veritas Tua deducant me ad montem sanctitatis Tuae, et ad habitacula Tua, ut 
ingrediar ad altare Dei, ad Deum, Ps. xliii 3, 4: </p>
<p>(o)et apud eundem,      	Lavo in innocentia manus meas, et circumdo altare Tuum, Jehovah, Ps. xxvi 6, 7. 	[5] At {13} quod altare fuerit repraesentativum 
cultus Domini, apud Esaiam,      	Omnia pecora Arabiae congregabuntur Tibi; arietes Nebaioth ministrabunt {14} Tibi, ascendent {15} ad beneplacitum altare Meum, lx 7: </p>
<p>{16} apud Jeremiam,  
    	Deseruit Dominus altare Suum, abominatus (x)est sanctuarium Suum, Threni ii (x)7; </p>
<p>`deserere altare' pro (o)abolere (x)repraesentativum cultus Domini ex bono amoris, `abominari sanctuarium' pro (o)abolere 
repraesentativum cultus Domini ex veris fidei: [6] apud Ezechielem,      	Destruentur altaria vestra, dispergam ossa vestra circum altaria vestra; devastabuntur et desolabuntur altaria vestra, 
et frangentur, et cessabunt idola vestra, vi 4-6; </p>
<p>`destrui, devastari et desolari altaria' pro (o)quod cultus repraesentativi: apud Esaiam,      	{17} Expiabitur iniquitas Jacobi cum posuerit omnes 
lapides altaris sicut lapides calcis dispersos, xxvii 9; </p>
<p>`lapides altaris dispersi' pro omnibus veris {18} cultus: [7] apud eundem,      	In die illo spectabit homo ad Factorem suum, et oculi ejus 
ad Sanctum Israelis, non autem spectabit ad altaria, opus manuum suarum, et quod fecerunt digiti illius {19}, (x)xvii 7, 8; </p>
<p>`altaria opus manuum, et quod fecerunt digiti' pro cultu ex propria intelligentia: 
[8] apud Hoscheam,      	Multiplicavit Ephraim altaria ad peccandum, viii 11; </p>
<p>`multiplicare altaria ad peccandum' pro fingere inania cultus: apud eundem,      	Tribulus et spina ascendet 
super altaria eorum {20}, x 8; </p>
<p>pro quod mala et falsa intrabunt et facient cultum {21}: [9] apud Esaiam,      	In die illo erit altare Jehovae in medio Aegypti, xix 19; </p>
<p>`altare Jehovae' pro cultu 
Domini. 	[10] (m)Altare, de quo nunc agitur, quia erat portatile, factum {22} erat ex lignis {23} schittim, et obductum aere, ast altare quod mansurum in suo loco, erat (o)vel ex humo vel ex lapidibus 
non caesis; altare ex humo erat {24} principale repraesentativum cultus Domini ex bono amoris; ex lapidibus autem non caesis, repraesentativum cultus ex bonis et veris {25} fidei, n. 8935, 8940; altare
