<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第68节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>68.</strong>我很清楚，很多人会说，活在肉身的人不可能与精灵及天使对话，也有很多人会说，我的所见所闻纯是幻想，或说，我记述这些事是为了沽名钓誉，诸如此类的。但不管人们怎么说，我都不气馁，因为这些都是我的看到的、听到的、感受到的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]68.</strong> I realize many will claim that no one can talk to spirits and angels as long as bodily life continues, or that I am hallucinating, or that I have circulated such stories in order to play on people's credulity, and so on. But none of this worries me; I have seen, I have heard, I have felt.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg lived in an age that was increasingly enamored of empirical observation and inductive reasoning from it. Thus he often (as here) backs up his claim to have experience of the spiritual world by asserting that it rests on the evidence of the senses — in this case the internal senses, which were opened up in him as a result of divine mercy, as he says in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_68/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_67" target=_top>67</a> above. Swedenborg often emphasizes that sensory perception is a comparatively low form of cognition compared to the internal senses; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_68/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_102" target=_top>102-104</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_68/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_127" target=_top>127</a>.

I am well aware that many will say that no one can possibly speak with spirits and angels so long as he lives in the body; and many will say that it is all fancy, others that I relate such things in 
order to gain credence, and others will make other objections. But by all this I am not deterred, for I have seen, I have heard, I have felt. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 68</b></p><p><b>68.</b>
I am well aware of the fact that many people will say that nobody can possibly speak to spirits or angels as long as he is living in the body, and that many will call it delusion. Some will say that 
I have spread these ideas around so as to win people's trust, while others will say something different again. But none of this deters me; for I have seen, I have heard, I have felt.  </p>

</p><b>68.</b>
Non me latet quod plures dicturi, quod nusquam aliquis loqui possit cum spiritibus et angelis quamdiu in corpore vivit; et plures, quod phantasia sit; alii, quod talia tradidero ut fidem captem; alii 
aliter; sed haec nihil moror, nam vidi, audivi, sensi. </p>
