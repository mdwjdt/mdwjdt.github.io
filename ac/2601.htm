<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2601节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2601.</strong>一些灵人被带入心灵宁静的状态，仿佛睡着了。在这种状态下，他们觉得自己好象在建几座小城，并且将不想让任何人侵犯的某个秘密事物藏在这些城当中，然后，把这些城交给别人，恳求他们不要侵犯城中的秘密事物。纯真，以及仁爱，连同秘密事物关系到主的观念就这样被注入到这些灵人里面。他们被保持在这种状态下相当长时间。这是含有纯真在里面的一种无知状态。有一个小孩子保护他们，免得有人伤害他们。在与之交谈时，我被其纯真和仁爱的状态，以及他们隐藏秘密时的那种挂心和唯恐它遭到侵犯的那种神圣敬畏深深打动。</p>

Some are reduced into a state of tranquillity, as it were a kind of sleep; and they then seem to themselves to be building small cities, and in the midst of them to hide some secret thing which they 
wish to preserve from violence. They give these cities to others, with entreaties not to do violence to the secret thing in the midst of them. Innocence is thus insinuated into them, and also charity, 
together with the idea that the secret thing is concerning the Lord. They are kept in this state a considerable time. It is a state of ignorance in which there is innocence. They are guarded by little 
children, lest anyone should do them harm. I have spoken with them, and have been much affected by their state of innocence and charity, and also by the solicitude with which they hide the secret, and 
by the holy fear lest it should be violated. </p>

Some are brought into a tranquil state of mind, into a kind of sleep. While in this state they seem to themselves to be building small cities, in the midst of which they conceal some secret thing which 
they wish to be violated by none. They then give these cities to others, entreating them not to violate the secret thing in the midst of them In this way innocence, and also charity, is instilled into 
these spirits, along with the idea that the thing which is secret has to do with the Lord. They are kept in this state for quite a long time. It is a state of ignorance that has innocence within it. 
They are protected by small children to prevent anyone doing them harm. When I spoke to them I was deeply moved by their state of innocence and charity, and also by the care which they took in the 
way they concealed the thing which was secret, and by their holy fear lest it should be violated. </p>

Quidam ex illis rediguntur in statum tranquillitatis quasi cujusdam somni, et tunc videntur sibi civitates parvas aedificare, ac in medio earum recondere aliquod arcanum quod volunt ut a nemine violetur; 
civitates illas donant aliis cum precibus ne violent arcanum in medio earum; innocentia illis insinuatur, tum charitas, cum idea quod arcanum sit de Domino; in hoc statu tenentur satis diu; est 
status ignorantiae, in qua innocentia: tutantur infantibus ne quisquam {1} eis damnum inferat. Cum illis locutus sum, et statu eorum innocentiae et charitatis multum affectus, tum sollicitudine {2} quomodo 
recondunt arcanum, ac timore sancto ne violetur. 	@1 quicquam.$ 	@2 i quoque.$ </p>
