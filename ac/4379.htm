<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4379节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4379.</strong>“若是催赶它们一天，群羊都必死了”表时间的流逝和随后的阶段，否则它们必不得活，因而有必要为结合做好准备。这从实际思路清楚可知。因为在前文，所论述的主题一直是良善与真理总体上的结合，但此处论述的是它们具体的结合。就内义而言，此处描述了真理被注入良善的实际过程。人从大体的解释也许能瞥见该过程的性质，却丝毫看不到与它相关的无数奥秘。这些奥秘只对那些居于天堂之光的人来说是清晰可见的，而居于尘世之光的人在天堂之光被允许进入尘世之光时能看到它们的粗糙轮廓。<br />这一点从以下事实足以明显看出来：当人再次出生时，他如同出生后的世人那样经历生命的各个阶段；前一个状态相对于随后的状态，总是像蛋一样；因而他不断被孕育和生出。这一过程不仅在他活在世上时这样，而且在他进入来世后永远如此。然而，就未来无限事物而言，他永远不可能被完善到超出蛋阶段的那个点。由此可见，涉及人重生的事何等数不胜数，而人们对此几乎一无所知；由此还能看出，包含在此处内义中的事有多少，而内义上所论述的主题是良善被注入真理的状态和方式。</p>

And if they drive them on in one day, all the flocks will die. That this signifies delay and what is successive, and that otherwise they would not live, thus that they are to be prepared for conjunction, 
may be seen from the series itself. For in the things that precede, the subject treated of has been the conjunction of good with truths in general, but here it is concerning the same specifically. 
The very process of the instilling of truth into good is here described in the internal sense. What its nature is, may indeed in some measure appear from the explication in general, but not as to its 
arcana, which are innumerable. These arcana are manifest only to those who are in the light of heaven, and in some rude image to those who are in the light of the world, when into this light is admitted 
the light of heaven. This may be sufficiently evident from the fact that when a man is being born again he passes through the ages of life as does one who is born [naturally] and that the state which 
precedes is always as an egg relatively to the following one; thus that he is continually being conceived and born; and this not only when living in the world, but also to eternity when he comes 
into the other life; and yet he can never be perfected further than to be as an egg relatively to the things that still remain, which are without limit. From all this it is evident how innumerable are 
the things which take place in connection with man's regeneration, yet of which scarcely any are known to man; thus how great are the things here contained in the internal sense, in which the subject 
treated of is the state and manner of the successive instilling of good into truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4379</b></p><p><b>4379.</b>
'And if the men overdrive them for one day, all the flocks will die' means a passage of time and a subsequent stage; also that otherwise they would not live, and so needed to be prepared to be joined 
together. This becomes clear from the actual train of thought. For in what has gone before the subject has been the joining of good to truths in general, whereas now the same joining together of them 
in particular is dealt with. The actual process in which truth is instilled into good is described at this point in the internal sense. One may catch a glimpse of what that process is like from the explanation 
in general; but one can see nothing of the countless arcana to do with it. Such arcana are clearly visible only to those who dwell in the light of heaven, while a rough outline of them is seen 
by those dwelling in the light of the world when the light of heaven is allowed to brighten that light. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Clear enough evidence of this exists in the fact that when a person is being born again 
he passes through phases analogous to those passed through after birth, and from the fact that a previous state is always like the egg in relation to the state that follows it, thus that there is a 
repeated occurrence of conception and birth. This is so not only when he lives in the world, but also when he enters the next life for ever. And even then he cannot be perfected beyond the point of being 
at the egg-stage so far as the limitless things to come are concerned. From this one may see how countless the things are which are involved in a person's regeneration, but of which people know scarcely 
anything, and one may see how many are the things contained in the internal sense at this point, where a subsequent state and the manner by which good is instilled into truths is the subject. </p>

</p><b>4379.</b>
`Et impulerint ea die uno, et morientur omnes greges': quod significet moram et successivum, et quod aliter non viverent, ita quod ad conjunctionem praeparanda, constare potest ab ipsa serie; </p>
<p>in 
illis enim quae praecedunt, actum est de conjunctione boni cum veris in genere, hic autem de eadem in specie agitur; ipse processus {1} insinuationis veri in bonum hic in sensu interno describitur; 
qui qualis sit, quidem ab explicatione in communi aliquantisper elucere potest, sed non quoad sua arcana quae innumerabilia sunt; haec arcana' patent solum illis qui in luce caeli sunt, et quoad aliquam 
rudem imaginem illis qui in luce mundi quando lux caeli in hanc admittitur: [2] hoc satis constare potest ex eo quod homo cum renascitur, percurrat aetates sicut qui nascitur, et quod praecedens 
status semper sit sicut ovum respective ad sequentem, ita quod continue concipiatur et nascatur; </p>
<p>et hoc non modo cum vivit in mundo, sed etiam cum venit in alteram vitam in aeternum, et usque 
tamen non ultra perfici potest quam ut sit sicut ovum ad illa quae supersunt, quae indefinita sunt: ex his patet quam innumerabilia sunt quae existunt circa regenerationem hominis, quorum tamen vix 
aliqua novit homo, ita quanta in sensu interno hic continentur, ubi de statu et modo insinuationis boni in vera successivo agitur.      @1 i enim$ </p>
