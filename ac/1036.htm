<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1036节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1036.</strong>创世记9:12-13.神说，这是立约的记号，是我在我与你们之间所立的，并与同你们一起的一切活的灵魂直到万代之间所立的。我把我的彩虹放在云彩中，这就可作我与地立约的记号了。<br />“神说”表事情就是这样。“这是立约的记号”表主以仁爱临在的标志。“我在我与你们之间所立的”表主藉着仁爱与人的结合。“同你们一起的一切活的灵魂”和前面一样，表人里面已重生的一切事物。“万代”表所有不断重新受造的人。“我把我的彩虹放在云彩中”表重生的属灵之人的状态，它就象彩虹，“云”表属灵之人相对属天之人所在的昏暗之光。“这就可作我与地立约的记号了”和前面一样，表主以仁爱临在的标志，“地”在此指人的自我中心。所有这些细节都关乎重生的属灵之人，或属灵教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1036.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_12-13" target=_top>Genesis 9:12-13</a>. And God said, "This is the sign of the pact that I make between me and you and every living soul that is with you, to everlasting generations: My bow I have put in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the pact between me and the earth."<br />And Jehovah said means so it was.{*1} This is the sign of the pact means an indication of the presence of the Lord in neighborly love. That I make between me and you symbolizes the Lord's close connection with us through neighborly love. And every living soul that is with you symbolizes (as it did before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1026" target=_top>1026</a>]) everything in us that has been reborn. To everlasting generations means all who are created anew, without end. A bow I have put in the cloud symbolizes the circumstances of a spiritual person who has been reborn, which resemble a rainbow. A cloud symbolizes the dim light in which a spiritual person lives, as compared to a heavenly person. And it will serve as a sign of the pact between me and the earth again means an indication of the presence of the Lord in charity; the earth here is human selfhood.<br />All these details have to do with a regenerate spiritual person, or the spiritual church.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_12" target=_top>Genesis 9:12</a> actually uses the name "God" rather than "Jehovah," but in the next section, where Swedenborg discusses the meaning, he treats the two names almost as interchangeable. For passages in Secrets of Heaven that distinguish between these names, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020" target=_top>1020</a>.

Verses 12, 13. And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living soul that is with you, for the generations of an age: I have set My bow in the cloud, and 
it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. "And God said" signifies that it was so; "this is the sign of the covenant" signifies an indication of the presence of the Lord in charity; 
"which I make between Me and you" signifies the conjunction of the Lord with man by charity; "and every living soul that is with you" signifies as before all things in man that have been regenerated; 
"for the generations of an age" signifies all perpetually who are being created anew; "I have set My bow in the cloud" signifies the state of the regenerated spiritual man, which is like a rainbow; 
"the cloud" signifies the obscure light in which is the spiritual man relatively to the celestial; "and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth" signifies as before an indication 
of the presence of the Lord in charity; "the earth" is here that which is man's own. All these things regard the regenerate spiritual man, or the spiritual church. </p>

Verse 12, 13 And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I give between Me and you and every living soul that is with you, into the generations of an age. I have given My bow in the cloud, and 
it will be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. 'And God said' means that it was so. 'This is the sign of the covenant' means a token of the Lord's presence in charity. 'Which I give 
between Me and you' means conjunction of the Lord with man by means of charity. 'And every living soul that is with you' means, as previously, all things with a person that have been regenerated. 'Into 
the generations of an age' means all unceasingly who are being created anew. 'I have given [My] bow in the cloud' means the state of a regenerate spiritual person, who is like a rainbow -'the cloud' 
means the obscure light in which the spiritual man dwells in comparison with the celestial man. 'And it will be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth' means, as previously, a token of 
the Lord's presence in charity, 'the earth' here being man's proprium. All these details have regard to a regenerate spiritual person or the spiritual Church. </p>

Vers. 12, 13.  Et dixit Deus, Hoc signum foederis, quod Ego do inter Me et inter vos, et inter omnem animam vivam, quae vobiscum: in generationes saeculi.  Arcum Meum dedi in nube, et erit in signum 
foederis inter Me et inter terram. 'Et dixit Deus' {1} significat quod ita esset: 'hoc signum foederis' significat indicium praesentiae Domini in charitate: 'quod Ego do inter Me et inter vos' significat 
conjunctionem Domini cum homine per charitatem: 'et inter omnem animam vivam quae vobiscum' significat, ut prius, omnia quae apud hominem regenerata sunt: 'in generationes saeculi' significat perpetuo 
omnes qui e novo creantur: 'arcum dedi in nube' significat statum hominis regenerati spiritualis, qui instar arcus iridis est, 'nubes, significat obscuram lucem in qua est spiritualis homo respective 
ad caelestem: 'et erit in signum foederis inter Me et inter terram' significat, ut prius, indicium praesentiae Domini in charitate; 'terra' hic est proprium hominis.  Haec omnia spectant hominem 
regeneratum spiritualem seu Ecclesiam spiritualem. 	@1 Jehovah I.$ </p>
