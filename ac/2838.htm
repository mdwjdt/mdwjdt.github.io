<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2838节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2838.</strong>“直到今日人还说”表永恒之物。这从下文所解释的圣言中“今日”的含义清楚可知。我们在圣言中时常读到“直到今日（或现今、今日、今天等）”，如前面创世记的经文：<br />他就是现今摩押人的始祖，现今亚扪人的始祖。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.37.htm">19:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.38.htm">38</a>）<br />后面创世记的经文：<br />那城名叫别是巴，直到今日。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.33.htm">26:33</a>）<br />还有：<br />以色列人不吃脱臼部位，就是大腿窝的筋，直到今日。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.32.htm">32:32</a>）<br />还有：<br />这就是拉结的墓碑，到今日还在。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.20.htm">35:20</a>）<br />约瑟定下常例，直到今日。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创47.26.htm">47:26</a>）<br />就历史意义而言，“直到今日”和“今日（或现今）”是指摩西还活着的那个时间，但就内义而言，这些词表状态的长久和永恒。“日”表状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）；今日、直到今日或现今，也就是现在的时间也是。在世上属时间之物在天上是永恒的。为了表现出永恒之义，经上就加上“直到今日”或“今日（或现今）”这个词，尽管在那些只知道历史意义之人看来，这个词似乎并不涉及未来之事。对这些词的类似用法也出现在圣言的别处（如约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.9.htm">4:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.25.htm">6:25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书7.26.htm">7:26</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.21.htm">1:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.26.htm">26</a>等）。<br />“今日或直到今日”表长久和永恒，这可见于诗篇：<br />我要传圣旨：耶和华曾对我说，你是我的儿子，我今日生你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.7.htm">2:7</a>）<br />此处“今日”明显表永恒之物。诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，你的话安定在天，直到永远。你的真理存到代代；你坚定了地，地就长存。天地照你的典章存到今日。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.89.htm">119:89</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.91.htm">91</a>）<br />此处“今日”也明显表永恒之物。耶利米书：<br />我使你在母腹中成形以先，就认识你；你未出母胎，我已分别你为圣；立作列族的先知。我今日立你在列族列国之上，我今日使你成为坚城、铁柱、铜墙。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.5.htm">1:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />从字面上看，这论述的是耶利米，但就内义而言，所指的是主；“我今日立你在列族列国之上，我今日使你成为坚城、铁柱、铜墙”表来自永恒。除了永恒之物外，没有什么东西能用来论及主。<br />摩西书：<br />今日你们全都站在耶和华你们的神面前，为要顺从耶和华你神的约，祂起的誓，就是耶和华你神今日与你所立的约，向你所起的誓。祂今日要立你作祂的子民，祂作你的神。不但与你们，还与凡今日同我们在此站在耶和华我们面前的，并今日不与我们同在的人（立这约，起这誓）。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申29.10.htm">29:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申29.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申29.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处从字面上看，“今日”是指摩西向百姓说话时的这个时间；但显而易见，它暗含随后的时间和长久之物；因为与人，与那些在那里和不在那里的人立约就暗含长久之物，长久本身就是内义上所表示的。<br />“每日”和“今日”表长久之物，这也可从每天例常的祭明显看出来。这祭因“按日期”、“每天或每日”和“今日”的含义而被称为常献的祭（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.3.htm">28:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.23.htm">23</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.13.htm">8:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.31.htm">11:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.11.htm">12:11</a>）。这一点从天上所降的吗哪看得更明显，对此，摩西书上说：<br />看哪，我要将粮食从天降下；百姓可以出去，每天收每天的分；不许什么人留到早晨。他们有留到早晨的，除了留到圣安息日前那一天的，都生虫变臭了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.4.htm">16:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.19.htm">19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这是因为吗哪表主的神性人（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.31.htm">6:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.32.htm">32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.49.htm">49</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.50.htm">50</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.58.htm">58</a>）。它因表主的神性人，故表天上的食物，天上的食物无非是爱与仁，以及信的良善与真理。在天上，主时时刻刻，因而持久永恒地将这食物赐给天使（参看<a href="2493.htm">2493</a>节）。这也是主祷文中“我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们”这句话（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.11.htm">6:11</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.3.htm">11:3</a>）的含义，今日就是每时每刻，直到永远。</p>

As it is said to this day. That this signifies what is perpetual, is evident from the signification of "today" in the Word explained in what follows. We read in several places in the Word, "even to this 
day," or "to today;" as in what goes before, "He is the father of Moab even unto this day; and the father of Ammon unto this day" (Gen. 19:37, 38); and later in the same book, "The name of the city 
is Beersheba, even to this day" (Gen. 26:33). Also this, "The sons of Israel eat not the sinew of the part put out of place, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, even to this day" (Gen. 32:32). And 
also this, "This is the pillar of Rachel's grave even unto this day" (Gen. 35:20). "Joseph made it a statute even to this day" (Gen. 47:26). In the historical sense these things regard the time when 
Moses lived; but in the internal sense by "this day" and by "today" there is signified perpetuity and eternity of state. That "day" is state may be seen above (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893); and thus "today" 
also, which is time present. That which is of time in the world, is eternal in heaven. That this might be signified, "today" is added, or "to this day," although it appears to those who are in the 
historical sense as if it involved nothing further. The like is said elsewhere in the Word (as Josh. 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; Judges 1:21, 26; and in other places).  [2] That "today" signifies perpetuity 
and eternity may be seen in David: </p>
<p>     I will tell of the decree: Jehovah hath said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee (Ps. 2:7); </p>
<p>where "this day" manifestly denotes what is eternal. 
In the same: </p>
<p>     Forever O Jehovah Thy Word is settled in the heavens, Thy truth is unto generation and generation; Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth; they abide this day according 
to Thy judgments (Ps. 119:89-91); </p>
<p>where also "this day" manifestly denotes what is eternal. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Before I formed Thee in the belly, I knew Thee; and before Thou camest forth out of 
the womb, I sanctified Thee; I gave Thee for a prophet unto the nations; I have set Thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, and I have made Thee this day a defensed city, and an iron pillar, 
and walls of brass (Jer. 1:5, 10, 18); </p>
<p>here in the sense of the letter Jeremiah is treated of, but in the internal sense the Lord is meant; "I have set Thee this day, or today, over the nations 
and over the kingdoms, and I have made Thee this day a defensed city" means that it was from eternity. Of the Lord nothing else than what is eternal can be predicated.  [3] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye are standing 
this day all of you before Jehovah your God, to enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into His oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day, that He may establish thee this day 
unto Himself for a people; and He will be a God unto thee; and not with you only, but with them who stand here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and with them who are not with us this day (Deut. 
29:10, 12-14). In the sense of the letter here "this day" is the time present when Moses spoke to the people; but that it nevertheless involves the time to come and what is perpetual, is evident; 
for to make a covenant with anyone, and with those who were there, and not there, involves perpetuity, and the perpetuity itself is what is meant in the internal sense.  [4] That "daily" and "this day" 
signify what is perpetual, is also evident from the sacrifice which was made every day. This, on account of the signification of "day," "daily," and "this day," was called the continual or perpetual 
sacrifice (Num. 28:3, 23; Deut. 8:13; 11:31; 12:11). This is still more plainly evident from the manna which rained from heaven, of which it is thus said in Moses: </p>
<p>     Behold I will rain bread from 
heaven; and the people shall go out and gather a portion day by day; and let no man leave of it till the morning. What they left till the morning bred worms, and putrefied, except what was kept the 
day before the Sabbath (Exod. 16:4, 19-20, 23). This was because the manna signified the Lord's Divine Human (John 6:31, 32, 49, 50, 58). And because it signified the Lord's Divine Human, it signified 
heavenly food, which is nothing else than love and charity together with the goods and truths of faith. This food is given by the Lord in the heavens to the angels every moment, and thus perpetually 
and to eternity (see n. 2493). This also is what is meant in the Lord's Prayer by "Give us this day our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11; Luke 11:3); that is, every instant to eternity. </p>

'As it is said today' means that which is perpetual. This is clear from the meaning of 'today' in the Word, dealt with below. One frequently reads in the Word the phrase 'even to this day (or today)', 
as in what has gone before, </p>
<blockquote>
He is the father of Moab even to this day, and the father of Ammon even to this day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2019:%2037,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 19: 37, 38</a>; </p>
<p> and in what appears later on, </p>
<p>The name of the city is Beersheba 
even to this day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2026:%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 26: 33</a>; </p>
<p> also, </p>
<p>The children of Israel do not eat the sinew of that which was displaced, which is on the hollow of the thigh, even to this day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2032:%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 32: 32</a>; </p>
<p> as well 
as, </p>
<p>This is the pillar of Rachel's grave even to [this] day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35: 20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Joseph made it a statute even to this day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2047:%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 47: 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the historical sense 'to this day' and 'today' refer to the 
time when Moses was alive, but in the internal sense these expressions mean perpetuity and eternity of state. 'Day' means state, see <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, and so therefore does 'today', which is 
the present time. That which in the world is temporal is in heaven eternal. To give the meaning of that which is eternal, the expression today or else to this day has been added, though to those who are 
aware only of the historical sense it does not appear to embody anything further. Similar usages of these expressions occur elsewhere in the Word, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%204:%209;%206:%2025;%207:%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 4: 9; 6: 25; 7: 26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%201:%2021,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 1: 21, 26</a>; 
and in other places. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'today' means that which is perpetual and eternal may be seen in David, </p>
<p>I will tell of the statute: Jehovah has said to me, You are My Son; today I have begotten You. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%202:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 2: 7</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'today' plainly stands for that which is eternal. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
For ever, O Jehovah, Your Word is fixed in the heavens, Your truth to generation after generation. You have 
established the earth and it stands. As for Your judgements they stand [even] today. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:%2089-91&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119: 89-91</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'today' plainly stands for that which is eternal. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Before I formed you 
in the belly, I knew you, and before you came out of the womb I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations. I have set you this day (today) over nations and over kingdoms; and I have 
made you today into a fortified city, and into a pillar of iron, and into walls of bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%201:%205,%2010,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 1: 5, 10, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers in the sense of the letter to Jeremiah, but in the internal sense the Lord 
is meant. 'I have set you this day (or today) over nations and over kingdoms, and I have made you today into a fortified city' means from eternity. In regard to the Lord one can only speak of that which 
is eternal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You are standing today, all of you, before Jehovah your God, so that you may enter into the covenant of Jehovah your God, and into His oath, which Jehovah your God 
is making with you today, that He may establish you today as a people for Himself, and that He will be God to you. Not indeed with you alone [do I make it], but with those who stand with us here today 
before Jehovah our God, and with those who are not with us today. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2029:%2010,%2012-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 29: 10, 12-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here in the sense of the letter 'today' means that present time when </p>
<p>Moses addressed the people. Yet it is 
clear that it nevertheless implies subsequent times and what is perpetual; for making a covenant with anyone, and with those who were there and with those who were not, implies that which is perpetual. 
Perpetuity itself is what is meant in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That 'daily' and 'today' mean that which is perpetual is clear also from the sacrifice that was offered each day. This sacrifice, because 
of what is meant by day, daily, and today, was called the continual, or perpetual, sacrifice, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:%203,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28: 3, 23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:%2013;%2011:%2031;%2012:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8: 13; 11: 31; 12: 11</a>. This may be even more plainly evident from the manna which 
rained from heaven, spoken of in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am causing bread to rain from heaven, and the people shall go out and gather a portion day by day. And they shall not leave any of it 
until the morning. That which they did leave until the morning bred worms and went rotten, except that gathered on the day before the Sabbath. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2016:%204,%2019,%2020,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 16: 4, 19, 20, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This happened because 'the manna' 
meant the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:%2031,%2032,%2049,%2050,%2058&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6: 31, 32, 49, 50, 58</a>, and because the Lord's Divine Human meant heavenly food, which is nothing other than love and charity, together with the goods and truths 
of faith. In heaven the Lord imparts this food to angels moment by moment, thus perpetually and eternally, see <a href="2193.htm">2193</a>. This is also what is meant in the Lord's Prayer by the petition, Give us today our 
daily bread, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6: 11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11: 3</a>, that is, in every moment for evermore. </p>

`Quod dicitur hodie':  quod significet perpetuum, constat a significatione `hodie' in Verbo, de qua sequitur: aliquoties legitur in Verbo, usque ad hunc diem, seu ad hodie; ut {1}prius,           Hic 
pater Moabi ad hunc usque diem; et pater Ammonis ad      hunc usque diem, Gen. xix 37, 38: </p>
<p>et {2}dein            Nomen urbis Beersheba usque ad hunc diem, Gen. xxvi 33: </p>
<p>{3}tum           Non edunt 
filii Israelis nervum {4}emoti, qui super       vola femoris, usque ad diem hunc, Gen. xxxii 32: </p>
<p>{5}ut et {6}      Haec statua sepulcri Rachelis, usque ad diem, Gen. xxxv 20.      Posuit Josephus 
in statutum, usque ad diem hunc, xlvii 26; </p>
<p>haec in sensu historico spectant tempus quando Moses vixit, sed in sensu interno per `hunc diem' et per `hodie' significatur status perpetuum et aeternum; 
quod `dies' sit status, videatur n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, ita quoque `hodie' quod est tempus praesens; quod temporis est in mundo, hoc aeternum est in caelo; ut hoc significaretur, adjectum est hodie, 
vel ad hunc diem, tametsi appareat iis qui in sensu historico sunt, tanquam nihil praeterea involveret; similiter dicitur alibi in Verbo, ut Jos. iv 9; vi 25; vii 26; Jud. i 21, 26; et aliis in 
locis.  [2] Quod `hodie' significet perpetuum et aeternum, constare potest apud Davidem,           Narrabo statutum, Jehovah dixit ad me, Filius Meus Tu,      Ego hodie genui Te, Ps. ii 7; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste 
`hodie' pro {7}aeterno: apud eundem           In aeternum Jehovah Verbum Tuum consistit in {8}caelis,      In generationem et generationem veritas Tua; stabilivisti      terram, et stat, ad judicia 
Tua stant hodie, Ps. cxix 89-91; </p>
<p>ubi etiam manifeste `hodie' pro aeterno: apud Jeremiam,           Antequam formavi te in ventre, novi te, et antequam      exires ex utero, sanctificabam te, 
prophetam gentibus dedi       te, ... praefeci te die hoc (hodie) super gentes et super      regna;...et dedi te hodie in urbem munitam, et in columnam      ferri, et in muros aeris, i 5, 10, 18; </p>
<p>ibi 
in sensu litterae agitur de Jeremia, sed in sensu interno intelligitur Dominus; `praefeci te die hoc, seu hodie, super gentes et super regna, et dedi te hodie in urbem munitam' pro ab aeterno; de 
Domino non aliud quam aeternum praedicari potest: [3] apud Mosen,           Vos stantes hodie omnes vos coram Jehovah Deo vestro,       ad transeundum in foedus Jehovae Dei tui, et in adjuramentum  
    Ipsius, quod Jehovah Deus tuus excidit tecum hodie, propterea      ut constituat te hodie Sibi in populum, et Ipse erit tibi in      Deum;...et quidem non cum vobis solis,...       sed cum qui  
    hic cum nobis stant hodie coram Jehovah Deo nostro, et cum qui      non cum nobis hodie, Deut. xxix 9, 11, 12, [13], 14 [A.V. 10,      12-15]; </p>
<p>hic in sensu litterae est `hodie' tempus praesens 
cum Moses locutus ad populum, sed `usque quod' involvat tempus sequens et perpetuum, constare potest, nam pangere foedus cum aliquo, et cum illis qui ibi et non ibi, involvit perpetuum; ipsum perpetuum 
est quod intelligitur in sensu interno.  [4] Quod `quotidie et hodie' significent perpetuum, constat etiam a sacrificio quod fiebat quovis die, hoc propter significationem diei, quotidie et hodie, 
dicebatur sacrificium juge, seu perpetuum, Num. xxviii 3, 23; Dan. viii 13; xi 31; xii II.  Hoc adhuc evidentius patet a manna quae pluebat ex caelo, de qua ita apud Mosen,           Ecce Ego pluere 
faciens panem e caelo, et exibit      populus, et colligent rem die in diem,...et non relinquetur de      eo ad mane:...quod reliquerunt ad mane, produxit vermes, et      computruit;...praeter quod 
die ante sabbatum, Exod. xvi 4, 19,      20, 23; </p>
<p>hoc ideo, quia `manna' significabat Divinum Humanum Domini, Joh. vi 31, 32, 49, 50, 58; et quia Divinum Humanum Domini, significabat cibum caelestem, 
qui non alius est quam amor et charitas cum fidei bonis et veris; hic cibus in caelis quovis momento angelis a Domino datur, ita in perpetuum et in aeternum, videatur n. 2493 hoc quoque est, quod 
intelligitur in Oratione Domini per           Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie, Matth. vi     11; Luc. xi 3; </p>
<p>hoc est, omni instanti in aeternum. @1 in praecedentibus$ @2 in sequentibus$ @3 
et dein$ @4 luxati$ @5 tum$ @6 i illius$  @7 i ab $ @8 caelo$ </p>
