<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6406节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6406.</strong>“他必毁坏脚跟”表由此而来的属世层中的混乱。这从“毁坏”和“脚跟”的含义清楚可知：“毁坏”是指把他从真理的状态中逐出，如刚才所述（<a href="6405.htm">6405</a>节），由此扰乱秩序，或制造混乱；“脚跟”是指属世层的最低级部分（<a href="259.htm">259</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节）。由此明显可知，“他必毁坏脚跟”表示属世层中的混乱。那些出于真理，尚未出于良善行事的人不可避免地在他们的属世层中造成混乱，因为行为或作为影响属世层；因此，他们必将他们的属世层关闭到这种程度；因为内层终止于其中的那个层面就是属世层，或说属世层形成内层止于其上的基础。即便属世层中没有混乱，从内层所流入的事物也会变得混乱；这些混乱的事物缺乏光明，处于幽暗和模糊之中。正因如此，这些人不能明白何为真理，而是陷入这种幽暗和模糊中，他们抓住不是真理的真理，并通过这非真理行事。此外，行为或作为绝对至关重要，因为它们是结果和生活中的仁与信，谁看不出，没有它们就没有仁爱可言？行为或作为无非是以外在形式表达的良善与真理本身；因为当存在于意愿中的良善和存在于理解力中的真理被付诸实践时，它们就被称为“行为或作为”。由此明显可知，良善与真理如何，行为或作为就如何，或也可说，良善与真理的性质决定了行为或作为的性质。</p>

He shall ravage the heel. That this signifies a want of order thence in the natural, is evident from the signification of "ravaging," as being to drive away from truth (see just above, n. 6405), thus 
to disturb the order, or cause a want of order; and from the signification of "heel," as being the lowest natural (n. 259, 4938-4952). Hence it is plain that by "he shall ravage the heel" is signified 
a want of order in the natural. They who do works from truth and not yet from good, must needs cause in their natural a want of order, for works affect the natural; and consequently they must needs 
to this extent close their interiors; for the plane in which the interiors terminate is the natural, and if this is devoid of order, all that which flows in from the interiors also becomes devoid of order; 
and all that which is devoid of order is dark and opaque, so that they cannot see what is truth, but in this opacity and darkness they seize for truth what is not truth, and from this non-truth 
do their works. Moreover works are most necessary, for they are charity and faith in effect and in life, and who cannot see that without them there is no charity? Works are nothing but good and truth 
themselves in outward form; for good which is of the will, and truth which is of the understanding, when put forth into act, are called "works;" hence it is evident that such as are the good and truth, 
such are the works. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6406</b></p><p><b>6406.</b>
'And he will ravage the heel' means consequent disorder in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'ravaging' as dislodging him from a state of truth, as immediately above in <a href="6405.htm">6405</a>, thus upsetting 
order or creating disorder; and from the meaning of 'the heel' as the lowest part of the natural, dealt with in <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>. From this it is evident that 'he will ravage the heel' means disorder 
in the natural. people performing works motivated by truth but not as yet by good inevitably introduce disorder into their natural, since works have an effect on the natural; and as a consequence they 
cannot help closing their interiors to the extent that they perform such works, since the natural forms the base on which the interiors rest. But if there is disorder in the natural, the things that 
flow in from the interiors become disordered too; and these things that disordered lack light and are in gloom. This being so, those people cannot see what the truth is, but in that gloom and lack of 
light they seize on as the truth what is not in fact the truth, and this is what then motivates them in their performance of works. Furthermore works are absolutely vital, for they are charity and faith 
when put into effect and expressed in life. Who fails to see that without works charity does not exist? Works are nothing else than actual goodness and truth expressed in an outward form; for when 
good which exists in the will and truth which exists in the understanding are put into action they are called works. From this it is evident that the nature of the goodness and truth determines that 
of the works. </p>

</p><b>6406.</b>
`(x)Et is depopulabitur calcaneum': quod significet inordinationem inde in naturali, constat ex significatione `depopulari' quod sit deturbare a vero, ut mox supra n. 6405, ita perturbare ordinem, seu 
inordinationem causari; et ex significatione `calcanei' quod sit infimum naturale, de qua n. 259, 4938-4952; inde patet quod per `is depopulabitur calcaneum' significetur inordinatio in naturali.  
Qui opera faciunt ex vero et nondum ex bono, illi non possunt aliter quam inordinationem inducere {1}naturali suo, nam opera naturale afficiunt; et consequenter non possunt non in tantum claudere sibi 
interiora, nam planum in quo terminantur interiora, est naturale; quod si inordinatum est, etiam inordinata fiunt quae ab interioribus influunt; et quae inordinata sunt, {2}tenebricosa sunt et opaca, 
quapropter non videre possunt quid verum, sed in opaco illo et tenebricoso arripiunt pro vero quod non verum est, et ex hoc non vero operantur opera.  Praeterea opera maxime necessaria sunt, nam illa 
sunt charitas et fides in effectu et in vita; quod absque illis non sit charitas, {3}quis non videre potest; opera non sunt aliud quam ipsum bonum et verum in forma externa; bonum enim quod est voluntatis 
et verum quod est intellectus, cum in actum mittuntur, vocantur opera; inde patet quod quale est bonum et verum talia sint opera. </p>
