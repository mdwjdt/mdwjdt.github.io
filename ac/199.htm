<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第199节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>199.</strong>“可吃的那棵树上的果子”，表上古教会揭示给他们的属乎信的良善与真理，亦即信仰认知，因为前面在论述属天之人，亦即上古教会时（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.16.htm">2:16</a>），经上是说“园中的树”，而此处则是说“园中树上的果子”。彼处所说的“园中的树”，象征对良善与真理的觉知，该良善与真理在此被称为“果子”（在圣经中也常以“果子”为象征），因为它们是觉知的产物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]199.</strong> As stated, the fruit of the tree from which they were to eat{*1} symbolizes religious goodness and truth, as it had been revealed to this generation by the earliest church; in other words, it symbolizes religious knowledge. This can be seen in the fact that they are told to eat from the fruit of the tree of the garden, not from the tree of the garden as before, in chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_199/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_16" target=_top>2:16</a>, where the heavenly person or the earliest church is the subject. The tree of the garden, as noted there [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_199/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_125" target=_top>125</a>], symbolizes perception of what is good and true. This sort of goodness and truth, because it is a product of perception, is here called fruit. Fruit has the same symbolism in many other places in the Word.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The text here actually reads "which they were not to eat," but the sense suggests that this is an error. Both Potts 1888-1902 (6:308, under "Tree" at this section number) and Elliott in his translation (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999) apparently make this emendation. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 199</b></p><p><b>199.</b>
That the "fruit of the tree of which they might eat" signifies the good and truth of faith revealed to them from the Most Ancient Church, or the knowledges [cognitiones] of faith, is evident from the 
fact that it is said to be the "fruit of the tree of the garden of which they might eat" and not the "tree of the garden" as before when treating of the celestial man, or the Most Ancient Church (Gen. 
2:16). The "tree of the garden" as it is there called, is the perception of what is good and true; which good and truth, because they are from that source, are here called "fruit" and are also frequently 
signified by "fruit" in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 199</b></p><p><b>199.</b>
The fruit from the tree from which they were allowed to eat means the good and truth of faith, that is, the cognitions of faith, revealed to them from the Most Ancient Church. This becomes clear from 
the fact that reference is made to 'the fruit from the tree of the garden' from which they were to eat, and not merely, as previously in 2:16 where the subject was the celestial man or Most Ancient Church, 
'from the tree of the garden'. As was stated at that point, the tree of the garden means perception, that is, the perception of good and truth. And because this good and truth are the product, 
it is here called fruit, as is also the meaning of 'fruit' many times in the Word.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 199</b>
</p><b>199.</b>
Quod 'fructus arboris, ex quo non comederent' significet bonum et verum fidei iis revelatum ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, seu quod cognitiones fidei, constare potest ex eo quod 'fructus arboris horti' dicatur 
ex quo comederent, non ut prius {1} (ubi de caelesti homine seu Antiquissima Ecclesia actum, cap. ii vers. 16) 'ex arbore horti': arbor horti, ut ibi dictum, significat perceptionem quae est boni 
et veri; quod bonum et verum quia inde, hic vocatur 'fructus'; sicut etiam fructus multoties significatur in Verbo. @	1 Parentheses inserted, not in I.$ </p>
