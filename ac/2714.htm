<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2714节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2714.</strong>“巴兰”表出于主的神圣人性的启示。这从“巴兰”的含义清楚可知，“巴兰”是指主的神圣人性，这一点从圣言中提及这个名字的经文明显看出来，如先知书哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华啊，我听见你的名声就惧怕。耶和华啊，求你在这些年间复兴你的作为，在这些年间显明出来；在发怒的时候以怜悯为念。神从提幔而来，圣者从巴兰山临到。（细拉）祂的荣光遮蔽诸天，地上充满祂的颂赞。祂的辉煌如同亮光；祂有从祂手里发出的号角，在其中藏着祂的能力。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.2.htm">3:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这明显论述主的到来，由“在这些年间复兴”和“在这些年间显明出来”来表示。其神圣人性由这些话来描述：“神从提幔而来，圣者从巴兰山临到”。经上说祂“从提幔而来”是指着属天之爱说的，“从巴兰山临到”是指着属灵之爱说的；启示和能力源于这些则由“祂的辉煌如同亮光；祂有从祂手里发出的号角”这些话来表示；“辉煌”和“亮光”表启示，“号角”表能力。<br />摩西书：<br />耶和华从西奈而来，从西珥向他们显现，从巴兰山发出光辉，从万万圣者中来临；从祂右手为他们传出烈火的律法。哦，祂疼爱百姓，众圣徒都在祂手中。他们聚集在祂的脚下，领受祂的言语。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.2.htm">33:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处论述的也是主，其神圣人性被描述为“从西珥向他们显现，从巴兰山发出光辉”，“从西珥”论及属天之爱，“从巴兰山”论及属灵之爱。“祂所疼爱的百姓”和“聚集在祂脚下的人”表示那些属灵之人，“脚”表主国度中较为低级，因而更模糊之物。<br />创世记：<br />十四年，基大老玛和与他结盟的王都来了，在西珥山杀败了何利人，一直杀到靠近旷野的伊勒巴兰。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.5.htm">14:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.6.htm">6</a>）<br />主的神圣人性在此由“西珥山”和“伊勒巴兰”来表示（参看<a href="1675.htm">1675</a>，<a href="1676.htm">1676</a>节）。民数记：<br />第二年二月二十日，云彩从法柜的帐幕收上去。以色列人就按站往前行，离开西奈的旷野，云彩停住在巴兰的旷野。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.11.htm">10:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.12.htm">12</a>）<br />百姓在旷野的一切旅程都表示一个争战的教会及其试探的状态，人在其中会屈服，但主为他们征服，因此它们表示主自己的实际试探和胜利。蒙主怜悯，这一事实将在别处予以说明。由于主藉着祂的神圣人性经受试探，故主的神圣人性在此同样由“巴兰的旷野”来表示。民数记中的这些话也一样：<br />以后百姓从哈洗录起行，在巴兰的旷野安营。耶和华晓谕摩西说：你派一些人，让他们去窥探我所赐给以色列人的迦南地。摩西就照耶和华的吩咐，从巴兰的旷野打发他们去。到了巴兰旷野的加低斯，他们返回，到摩西、亚伦并以色列人的全会众那里，回报他们，又把那地的果子给他们看。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民12.16.htm">12:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.26.htm">26</a>）<br />他们从巴兰的旷野起行窥探迦南地表示凭借主的神圣人性，这些人，也就是表示那些属灵之人的以色列人，得以进入迦南地所表示的天国。但当时他们的踯躅不前也表示出他们的软弱，正因如此，主才成全律法的一切事，经受试探并得胜，好叫那些具有仁之信的人，以及那些经受主在其中得胜的试探之人通过祂的神圣人性获得救恩。这也解释了为何主在旷野受试探（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.1.htm">4:1</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.12.htm">1:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">13</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.1.htm">4:1</a>；参看<w1>2708<w2>2708<w3>节）。</p>

That "Paran" is illumination from the Lord's Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "Paran," as being the Lord's Divine Human, which is manifest from the passages in the Word where it is 
named, as in the prophet Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, I have heard Thy fame, I was afraid; O Jehovah, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known, in zeal remember mercy. 
God will come from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran; Selah: His honor covered the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise; and His brightness shall be as the light. He had horns going 
out from His hand, and there was the hiding of His strength (Hab. 3:2-4); </p>
<p>where the Lord's advent is plainly treated of, which is signified by "reviving in the midst of the years," and by "making down 
in the midst of the years." His Divine Human is described by "God coming from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran." He is said to "come from Teman" as to celestial love, and "from Mount Paran" 
as to spiritual love; and that illumination and power are from these is signified by saying that there shall be "brightness and light," and by His having "horns going out from His hand;" the "brightness 
and light" are illumination, and the "horns" are power.  [2] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them; He shone forth from Mount Paran, and He came from the ten thousands 
of holiness; from His right hand was a fire of law unto them; yea, He loveth the peoples; all His saints are in thy hand, and they were gathered together at thy foot, and he shall receive of thy 
words (Deut. 33:2, 3). Here also the Lord is treated of, whose Divine Human is described by His "rising from Seir, and shining forth from Mount Paran"-from "Seir" as to celestial love, and from "Mount 
Paran" as to spiritual love. The spiritual are signified by the "peoples whom He loves," and by their being "gathered together at His foot." The "foot" signifies what is lower, and thus more obscure, 
in the Lord's kingdom.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him smote the Horites in their Mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is in the wilderness (Gen. 14:5, 6); </p>
<p>that 
the Lord's Divine Human is here signified by "Mount Seir," and by "El-paran," may be seen above (n. 1675, 1676). In the same: </p>
<p>     It came to pass in the second year, in the second month, in the twentieth 
day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony and the sons of Israel set forward according to their journeys, out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud 
abode in the wilderness of Paran (Num. 10:11, 12). [4] That the journeys of the people in the wilderness all signify the state of a combating church and its temptations, in which man yields but the 
Lord conquers for him-consequently the very temptations and victories of the Lord-will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown elsewhere; and because the Lord from His Divine Human sustained temptations, 
the Lord's Divine Human is here signified in like manner by the "wilderness of Paran." And so again by these words in the same: </p>
<p>     The people afterwards journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched their 
camp in the wilderness of Paran. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Send thou men, and let them explore the land of Canaan, which I give unto the sons of Israel and Moses sent them from the wilderness 
of Paran, according to the command of Jehovah. And they returned, and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran to Kadesh; and 
brought back word unto them, and showed them the fruit of the land (Num. 12:16; 13:1-3, 26). [5] By their setting out from the wilderness of Paran and exploring the land of Canaan, is signified that 
through the Lord's Divine Human the sons of Israel, that is, the spiritual, have the heavenly kingdom, which is signified by the land of Canaan; but their also succumbing at that time signifies their 
weakness, and that the Lord therefore fulfilled all things in the Law, and endured temptations, and conquered; and that they who are in the faith of charity, as also they who are in temptations in which 
the Lord conquers, have salvation from His Divine Human. On which account also, when the Lord was tempted, He was in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1; Mark 1:12, 13; Luke 4:1; see above, n. 2708). </p>

That 'Paran' means enlightenment coming from the Lord's Divine Human is clear from the meaning of 'Paran' as the Lord's Divine Human, as is evident from those places in the Word where this name is used, 
as in the prophet Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, I have heard Your fame; I was afraid. O Jehovah, revive Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known. In zeal You will remember 
mercy. God will come out of Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His fame has covered the heavens, and the earth has been filled with His praise. And His brightness will be as the light; 
He has horns going out of His hand, and there the hiding-place of His strength will be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:%202-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3: 2-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This plainly refers to the Lord's Coming, which is meant by 'reviving in the midst of the years' 
and 'making known in the midst of the years'. His Divine Human is described by the words 'God will come out of Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran'. He is said to come 'out of Teman' in regard 
to celestial love, and 'from Mount Paran' in regard to spiritual love; and the springing of these from enlightenment and power is meant by the words 'His brightness will be as the light; He has horns 
going out of His hand'. 'Brightness' and 'light' mean enlightenment, 'horns' power. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah came from Sinai, and dawned from Seir upon them; He shone from Mount Paran, and came 
from myriads of holiness From His right hand came a fiery law for them. He indeed loves the peoples. All His holy ones are in your hand and have been joined together at your feet; and He will receive 
of your words. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33: 2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also refers to the Lord, whose Divine Human is described by the words 'He dawned from Seir' and 'He shone from Mount Paran' - 'from Seir' being used in regard to 
celestial love, 'from Mount Paran' to spiritual love. Those who are spiritual are meant by 'the peoples whom He loves' and by 'those joined together at your feet', 'the foot' meaning that which is lower, 
and so more obscure, in the Lord's kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Chedorlaomer and the kings with him smote the Horites in their Mount Seir as far as El-paran, which is over into the wilderness. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2014:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 14: 5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>As regards the Lord's Divine Human being meant there by 'Mount Seir' and by 'El-paran', see <a href="1675.htm">1675</a>, <a href="1676.htm">1676</a>. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
So it was, in the second year, in the second month, 
on the twentieth day in the month, that the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony. And the children of Israel travelled according to their travels from the wilderness of Sinai, 
and the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paran. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:%2011,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10: 11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The truth that all the travels of the people in the wilderness mean the state of the Church militant, and its temptations, in 
which a person goes under but the Lord conquers on his behalf, and the truth that consequently they mean the Lord's own actual temptations and victories, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown elsewhere. 
And because the Lord underwent temptations by reason of His Divine Human, the Lord's Divine Human is in a similar way meant here by 'the wilderness of Paran'. The same is also meant by the following 
in the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
After that the people travelled from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and said, Send men and let them explore the land of Canaan 
which I am giving to the children of Israel. And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran as spoken by the mouth of Jehovah. And they returned to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of 
the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran in Kadesh; and they brought back word to them, and showed them the fruit of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2012:%2016;%2013:%201-3,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 12: 16; 13: 1-3, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Their travelling from the wilderness 
of Paran to explore the land of Canaan means that by means of the Lord's Divine Human these people - the children of Israel, by whom were meant those who are spiritual - have access to the heavenly 
kingdom, meant by the land of Canaan. But their faltering also at that time means their weakness, on account of which the Lord fulfilled everything in the Law, underwent temptations and was victorious, 
so that those with whom faith grounded in charity resides, also those who undergo temptations in which the Lord is victorious, have salvation from His Divine Human. This also explains why, when the 
Lord was tempted, He was in the wilderness, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4: 1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1: 12, 13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4: 1</a>; see above in <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>.

Quod `Paran' sit illuminatio ex Divino Humano Domini, constat a significatione `Paran' quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini, ut patet ab illis locis in Verbo ubi nominatur, ut apud prophetam Habakkuk, 	 
  Jehovah, audivi famam Tuam, timui, Jehovah, opus Tuum, in medio annorum vivifica illud, in medio annorum notum fac, in zelo misericordiae recorderis.  Deus e {1} Temane veniet, et Sanctus de monte 
Paran, selah; texit caelos honor Ipsius, et laude Ipsius plena est terra: et splendor sicut lux erit {2}, cornua {3} de manu Ipsius Ipsi, et ibi occultatio roboris Ipsius, iii 2-4; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste de Adventu 
Domini, qui per `vivificare in medio annorum,' et `notum facere in medio annorum,' significatur; Divinum Humanum Ipsius describitur per quod `Deus e {1} Temane veniet, et Sanctus de monte Paran'; 
`e {4} Temane' dicitur quoad amorem caelestem, et `de monte Paran' quoad amorem spiritualem; et quod exinde illuminatio {5} et potentia, significatur per quod `splendor et lux erit {6}, cornua de manu 
Ipsius Ipsi'; `splendor et lux' sunt illuminatio, `cornua' sunt potentia: [2] apud Mosen, 	Jehovah de Sinai venit, et exortus est de Seir illis, exsplenduit de monte Paran, et venit ex myriadibus 
sanctitatis, a dextra Ipsius ignis legis illis, etiam amans populos; omnes sancti Ipsius in manu tua, et conjuncti sunt ad pedem tuum, et feret de verbis tuis, Deut. xxxiii 2, 3; </p>
<p>etiam ibi de Domino, 
Cujus Divinum Humanum describitur per quod `exortus e Seir {5}, et exsplenduerit de monte Paran'; `e Seir' dicitur quoad  amorem  caelestem, `de {7} monte  Paran' quoad  amorem spiritualem; spirituales 
significantur per `populos quos amat, et per conjunctos ad pedem'; `pes' significat inferius, ita obscurius {8}, in regno Domini: [3] apud eundem, 	Kedorlaomer et reges cum illo percusserunt... Horitas 
in monte eorum Seir, usque El-paran, quae super in desertum, Gen. xiv 5, 6; </p>
<p>quod Divinum Humanum Domini ibi significetur per `montem Seir' et per `El-paran,' videatur n. 1675, 1676: apud eundem, 	Fuit 
in anno secundo in mense secundo, in vigesimo in mense, se sustulit nubes desuper tabernaculo testimonii; e profecti sunt filii Israelis secundum profectiones suas, e deserto Sinai, et resedit 
nubes in deserto Paran, Num. x 11, 12; </p>
<p>[4] quod profectiones populi in deserto omnes significent statum Ecclesiae pugnantis, et ejus tentationes, in quibus homo succumbit sed pro illo Dominus vincit, 
consequenter quod ipsas tentationes et victoria: Domini, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi ostendetur; et quia Dominus tentationes sustinuit ex Humano Divino Suo, per `desertum Paran' hic similiter
