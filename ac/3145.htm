<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3145.</strong>“卸了骆驼”表那些要服务的事物的自由。这从“卸”和“骆驼”的含义清楚可知：“卸”是指释放；“骆驼”是指一般的记忆知识，因而是指要来用服务的事物，如刚才所述（<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>节）。其中真实的情况是这样：没有自由，真理不可能在属世人里面产生，也不可能从那里被召唤出来进入理性人，并在理性人中与良善联结。所有这些事都是在自由状态下发生的，因为正是对源于良善的真理的情感使它们自由。真理若非出于情感、因而在自由中获得，就不会被植入在心智中，更不会朝心智的内层被提升，并在那里变成信。一切改造皆在自由中实现，一切自由皆伴随情感，主将人保守在自由中，以便他能貌似凭自己和自己的东西拥有对真理和良善的情感，从而得以重生（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节）。这就是“卸了骆驼”所表示的；若它们不是这类事物的含义，那这些细节就太微不足道，不值一提了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3145</b></p><p><b>3145.</b>
And loosed the camels. That this signifies freedom for those things which were to serve, is evident from the signification of "loosing," as being to make free; and from the signification of "camels," 
as being general memory-knowledges, and thus the things which were to serve (as just above, n. 3143). The real case herein is this: Without freedom no production of truth in the natural man is possible, 
nor any calling forth therefrom into the rational, and conjunction with good there. All these things take place in a free state; for it is the affection of truth from good which produces freedom. 
Unless truth is learned from affection, thus in freedom, it is not implanted; still less is it exalted toward the interiors and there made faith. That all reformation is effected in freedom, and that 
all freedom is of affection, and that the Lord keeps man in freedom, so that he may from himself and from what is his own be affected with truth and good and thereby be regenerated, may be seen above 
(n. 2870-2893). This is what is signified by "loosing the camels;" for if they were not significative of such things, these particulars would be too trifling to be recorded. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3145</b></p><p><b>3145.</b>
'And he ungirded the camels' means freedom for the things that were to be subservient. This is clear from the meaning of 'ungirding' as freeing, and from the meaning of 'the camels' as general facts, 
and so things that were to be subservient, as dealt with just above in <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>. The situation is that without freedom no production of truth ever takes place in the natural man, nor summoning of it from 
there into the rational man, where it becomes joined to good. It is in a state of freedom that all these things come about, for it is the affection for truth springing from good that sets them free. 
Unless truth is learned with an affection for it, and so in freedom, it is not even implanted in the mind, let alone raised up towards the interior parts of the mind to become faith there. For all reformation 
is effected in freedom; all freedom goes together with affection, and the Lord keeps man in freedom so that he can - as if of himself and from what is his own - have an affection for what is 
true and good and so be regenerated, see <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>. These are the things meant by 'he ungirded the camels'; and unless those things were meant, the details recorded here would have been too trivial to mention. </p>

</p><b>3145.</b>
`Et solvit camelos': quod significet liberum illis quae inservitura, constat a significatione `solvere' quod sit liberum facere, et a significatione `camelorum' quod sint scientifica communia, ita illa 
quae inservitura, ut mox supra n. (x)3143 ipsa res se ita habet: absque libero nusquam aliqua {1}productio veri in naturali homine, nec evocatio inde in rationalem, et {2}ibi cum bono conjunctio; 
in statu libero fiunt omnia illa; est enim affectio veri ex bono quae facit liberum; nisi verum discatur ex affectione, ita in libero, non implantatur, minus versus interiora exaltatur, ac ibi fides fit: 
quod omnis reformatio fiat in libero, et quod omne liberum sit affectionis, et quod Dominus in libero teneat hominem, ut is possit sicut ex se et proprio affici vero et bono, et sic regenerari, videatur 
n. 2870-2893; haec sunt quae significantur per quod `solverit camelos,' quae nisi illa significarent, leviora forent quam ut memorarentur. @1 formatio$  @2 hic$  </p>
