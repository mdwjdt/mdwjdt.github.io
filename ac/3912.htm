<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3912节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3912.</strong>创世记30:3-5.拉结说，看哪，我的使女辟拉；你可以与她同房，使她生子在我膝下，我便因她也被建立。拉结就把她的使女辟拉给丈夫为妾，雅各便与她同房，辟拉就怀孕，给雅各生了一个儿子。<br />“拉结说，看哪，我的使女辟拉”表属世真理与内在真理之间的肯定方法。“你可以与她同房”表用这种方法就会具有结合的能力。“使她生子在我膝下”表内在真理情感的承认，结合就始于这种情感。“我便因她也被建立”表该情感由此拥有生命。“拉结就把她的使女辟拉给丈夫为妾”表与肯定方法的联结得以建立。“雅各便与她同房”表与它联结。“辟拉就怀孕，给雅各生了一个儿子”表接受并承认。</p>

Verses 3-5. And she said, Behold my maidservant Bilhah, come to her and she shall bear upon my knees, and I shall be built, even I from her. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for a woman, and Jacob 
came to her. And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. "And she said, Behold my maidservant Bilhah," signifies the affirming means there is between natural truth and interior truth; "come to her," 
signifies that with this there is the faculty of conjunction; "and she shall bear upon my knees," signifies acknowledgment in the affection of interior truth, from which there is conjunction; "and I 
shall be built, even I, from her," signifies that thereby this affection has life; "and she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for a woman" signifies that the affirmative means was adjoined; "and Jacob came 
to her," signifies that it was conjoined; "and Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son," signifies reception and acknowledgment. </p>

Verses 3-5 And she said, Behold, my maidservant Bilhah; go [in] to her, and let her bear [a child] upon my knees, and I too shall be built up from her. And she gave him Bilhah her servant-girl as his 
wife, and Jacob went [in] to her. And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. </p>
<p>'She said, Behold, my maidservant Bilhah' means the affirming means, which has its place between natural truth and interior 
truth. 'Go [in] to her' means that with this means there exists the ability to effect a joining together. 'And let her bear [a child] upon my knees' means acknowledgement by the affection for interior 
truth, in which affection the joining together begins. 'And I too shall be built up from her' means that in this way it has life. 'And she gave him Bilhah her servant-girl as his wife' means that 
a link with the affirmative means was established. 'And Jacob went [in] to her' means a joining to it. 'And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son' means reception and acknowledgement. </p>

</p><b>3912.</b>
Vers. 3-5.  Et dixit, Ecce famula mea Bilhah, veni ad illam, et pariat super genua mea, et aedificabor etiam ego ex illa. Et dedit ei Bilham ancillam suam ad mulierem, et venit ad illam Jacob; et 
concepit Bilhah, et peperit Jacobo filium. `Dixit, Ecce famula mea Bilhah' significat medium affirmans quod inter naturale verum ac interius verum: `veni ad illam' significat quod tum illo conjunctionis 
facultas: `et pariat super genua mea' significat agnitionem affectione interioris veri, ex qua conjunctio: `et aedificabor etiam ego ex illa' significat quod sic vita ei; `et dedit ei Bilham 
ancillam suam ad mulierem' significat medium affirmativum adjunctum: `et venit ad illam Jacob' significat quod conjunctum: `et concepit Bilhah, et peperit Jacobo filium' significat receptionem et 
agnitionem. </p>
