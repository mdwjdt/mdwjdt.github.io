<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7724节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7724.</strong>“你们的小孩子也可以和你们同去”表叫他们出于真理敬拜祂。这从“小孩子”和“和你们同去”的含义清楚可知：“小孩子”，在此是指真理，因为“小孩子”包含男孩、少年人和年轻人，简言之，是指他们的儿子，而儿子表示凡属聪明之物，因而表示真理（参看<a href="7668.htm">7668</a>节）；“和你们同去”是指对于离开他们，好叫他们敬拜主，他们的神的一种保证。有必要说一说何谓出于良善敬拜主，何谓出于没有良善的真理敬拜主，它们在此由“羊群、牛群要留下”和“小孩子可以去”来表示。最真实的敬拜是出于良善通过真理献上的，因为主存在于良善中。但出于没有良善的真理的敬拜并不是敬拜，只是一种外在仪式和行为，没有任何内在之物；因为没有良善的真理只不过是记忆知识。这记忆知识若要变成信之真理，就必须与良善结合，当与良善结合时，就会进入内在人，变成信。前面频繁说明，无仁之信并非信。由此可见，何谓出于良善的敬拜，何谓出于没有良善的真理的敬拜。敬拜所源于的良善是指生活的良善，这良善通过与真理结合而变得属灵；因为属灵良善从真理获得其具体性质，真理从良善获得其本质；因此，良善是真理的灵魂。由此再次可以看出，没有良善的真理是什么样，即它就像没有灵魂的身体，因而就像一具死尸。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7724</b></p><p><b>7724.</b>
Your babe also shall go with you. That this signifies that they should worship from truth, is evident from the signification of "babe" here, as being truth; for by "babe" are meant boys, youths, young 
men, in a word, sons, by whom are signified whatever is of intelligence, thus truths (see n. 7668); and from the signification of "going with you," as being that they were to be left so that they may 
worship the Lord their God. It must be told what it is to worship the Lord from good, and what to worship from truth without good, which are here signified by "the flock and the herd that should stay," 
and by "the babe that should go." The veriest worship is from good through truth, for the Lord is present in good. But worship from truth without good is not worship, but only an external rite and 
act, without any internal; for truth without good is merely memory-knowledge. To make this memory-knowledge of faith, it must be conjoined with good, and then it passes into the internal man, and becomes 
faith. That faith without charity is not faith, has been frequently shown above. From this it is evident what is meant by worship from good, and what by worship from truth without good. By the good 
from which is worship, is meant the good of life, which has been made spiritual by conjunction with truth; for spiritual good has its quality from truth, and truth has its essence from good, so that 
good is the soul of truth. From this it is again evident what truth is without good-that it is like a body without a soul, thus is like a carcass. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7724</b></p><p><b>7724.</b>
'Your little children also will go with you' means that [they may worship Him] from truth. This is clear from the meaning here of 'little children' as truth, for 'little children' implies boys, adolescents, 
and young men, In short, their sons, who mean aspects of intelligence, thus truths, see <a href="7668.htm">7668</a>; and from the meaning of 'going with you' as an assurance that they are to be left alone in order that 
they may worship the Lord their God. Let me say what worshipping the Lord from good is, and what worshipping the Lord from truth without good is, meant here when Pharaoh says that the flocks and herds 
are to stay behind and the little children to go. The truest kind of worship consists in an offering made from good through truth, for the Lord is present in good; but worship offered from truth 
without good is not worship, only outward religious ceremony and action alone with nothing real in them since without good truth is no more than the knowledge of truth. To become the truth of faith that 
knowledge must be combined with good, and when combined with good it passes into the internal man and becomes faith. (The fact that faith without charity is not faith has been shown often.) From this 
one may see what worship from good is and what worship from truth without good is. By the good from which worship springs one should understand the good of life, good that has been made spiritual through 
combination with truth, for spiritual good derives its particular nature from truth, and the essence of truth is good, so that good is the soul of truth. From this one may again see what truth 
without good is like, namely like a body without its soul, that is, like a corpse. </p>

`Etiam infans ibit cura vobis': quod significet quod ex vero, constat ex significatione `infantis' hic, quod sit verum, nam per `infantem' intelliguntur pueri, adolescentes, juvenes, verbo, filii, per 
quos quod significentur illa quae sunt intelligentiae, ita vera, videatur n. 7668; et ex significatione `ire cum vobis' quod sit quod relinquendi ut colant Dominum Deum suum.  Dicendum quid sit colere 
Dominum ex bono, {1}et quid colere ex vero absque bono, quae hic {2}significantur per `gregem et armentum quod subsistet,' et per `infantem quod ibit': ipsissimus cultus fit ex bono per verum, nam 
Dominus in bono est praesens; cultus autem ex vero absque bono non est cultus, sed {3}modo ritus et actus externus absque interno, est enim verum absque bono {4}duntaxat scientificum; id scientificum 
ut fiat fidei, conjungetur bono, et tunc transit in internum hominem {5}, et fit fides; quod fides absque charitate non sit fides, saepius {6} ostensum est; inde patet quid sit cultus ex bono et quid 
cultus ex vero absque bono.  Per bonum ex quo cultus intelligitur bonum vitae, quod spirituale factum est per conjunctionem cum vero, nam bonum spirituale quale suum habet ex vero, ac verum essentiam 
suam habet ex bono, sic ut bonum sit anima veri; inde iterum patet quale est verum absque bono, quod sit sicut corpus absque anima, ita sicut cadaver. 	@1 aut$ 	@2 significatur per quod grex et armentum
