<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4820节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4820.</strong>“就娶了她，与她同房”表犹大支派与这些事物联结，也就是与源于邪恶的虚假所生的邪恶联结。这从“娶了她，与她同房”的含义清楚可知：“娶了她”，也就是说娶她为妻，并“与她同房”是指联结起来，如前面所频繁解释的。因为就内义而言，婚姻代表良善与真理的联结，因为良善与真理是婚姻的源头（<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节），但就反面意义而言，则是邪恶与虚假的苟合，在此是指犹大支派与邪恶并虚假的苟合，因为这话是指着犹大说的，而犹大表示以他命名的支派（参看<a href="4815.htm">4815</a>节）。此处经上没有说他娶她为妻，只说他娶了她，与她同房。这是因为这种结合是非法的（<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>节），还因为经上如此暗示这不是婚姻，而是淫乱，因而她所生的儿子也是淫乱的结果。邪恶与虚假的结合并非别的。她后来被称为犹大的妻子，下文会讨论“过了许多日子，犹大的妻子书亚的女儿死了”这些话（38:12）。</p>

And he took her, and came to her. That this signifies that the tribe of Judah conjoined itself with these things, namely, with evils from the falsities of evil, is evident from the signification of "taking 
her"-that is to say, for a woman-and "coming" or "entering to her," as being to be conjoined, as explained several times above. For in the internal sense marriages represent the conjunction of 
good and truth, because this is their source (n. 2727-2759), but in the opposite sense the conjunction of evil and falsity, here the conjunction of the tribe of Judah with evil and falsity; for this is 
said of Judah, by whom is signified the tribe named after him, as may be seen above (n. 4815). It is not said here that he took her for a wife, but only that he took her and came to her, for the reason 
that the connection was unlawful (n. 4818); and also because it was thus tacitly indicated that it was not a marriage, but a whoredom, thus that the sons born of her were born of whoredom. The conjunction 
of evil with falsity is nothing else. Her being afterwards called his wife; in these words-"and the days were multiplied, and Shua's daughter died, the wife of Judah" (verse 12)-will be spoken 
of below. </p>

'And he took her and came [in] to her' means that the tribe of Judah joined itself to these, that is to say, to evils begotten by falsities springing from evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking 
her', that is to say, making her his wife, and of 'coming (or going in) to her' as being joined together, dealt with frequently already; for in the internal sense marriages represent the joining together 
of good and truth, because good and truth are the source of them, <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>. But in the contrary sense marriages represent the joining together of evil and falsity, in this case the joining of 
the tribe of Judah to these; for what is said here refers to Judah who, as seen above in <a href="4815.htm">4815</a>, means the tribe named after him. It is not said that he took her as his wife, only 'he took her and came 
[in] to her. This wording is used because the coupling was an illicit one, <a href="4818.htm">4818</a>, and also because, without actually saying so, it points out that the union was not a marriage but whoredom, and thus that 
the sons born from her were also the result of whoredom. The fact that after this she is called his wife - in the words 'And the days were multiplied, and Shua's daughter died, the wife of Judah', 
verse 12 - will be discussed below. </p>

`Et accepit illam et venit ad illam': quod significet quod tribus Jehudae conjungeret se illis, nempe malis ex falsis mali, constat ex significatione `accipere illam' nempe in mulierem et `venire 
seu intrare ad illam' quod sit conjungi, de qua aliquoties prius; conjugia enim in sensu interno repraesentant conjunctionem boni et veri quia inde sunt, n. 2727-2759, at in opposito sensu conjunctionem 
mali et falsi, hic conjunctionem tribus Jehudae cum illis, nam de Jehuda dicitur, per quem quod significetur tribus ab illo nominata, videatur supra 4815; hic non dicitur quod acceperit illam 
in uxorem sed solum `quod acceperit et venerit ad illam', ex causa quia copulatio illegitima erat, n. 4818, tum {1} quia sic tacite indicaretur quod non conjugium sed scortatio esset, ita (o)quod 
filii ex illa etiam ex scortatione nati essent; conjunctio quoque {2} mali cum falso {3} nec aliud est; quod postea dicta fuerit uxor ejus his verbis, `et multiplicati dies, et moriebatur filia Shuae 
uxor Jehudae', vers. 12, dicetur infra.      @1 et$      @2 etiam$      @3 i quae in sensu interno hic significatur$ </p>
