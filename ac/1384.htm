<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1384节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1384.</strong>关于第一种，即天使般的直觉。它就在于直觉什么是真与善，什么是出于主的，什么是出于自我的，以及源于自我的思维、话语和行为的来源和性质。我曾被恩准与上古教会的众子谈论他们的直觉。他们说，他们不凭自己思考，也思考不了什么，并且凭自己根本意愿不了什么；在其所思所愿的一切事物中，无论总体还是细节，他们直觉哪些来自主，哪些来自其它来源；他们不仅直觉有多少是来自主的，有多少看似来自他们自己的，还直觉它何时看似来自他们自己，它实际来自何处。这时，他们会直觉它来自哪些天使，这些天使的品质如何，他们的思维是什么，直至最细小的差异。因此，他们直觉这流注是什么，以及无数其它事物。这直觉多种多样。爱主的属天天使拥有对良善的直觉，并由此拥有对真理的方方面面的直觉；由于他们直觉真理与良善，故他们不肯谈论真理，更不肯推理真理；他们只会说是或不是。属灵天使同样拥有直觉，但和属天天使不一样，他们会谈论真理与良善；不过，属灵天使仍能直觉它们，尽管有所不同；因为这直觉有无数多样性，这些多样性与他们直觉事物是否出于主的意愿、旨意或应许有关，所有这些彼此截然不同。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1384.</strong> Let us turn to the first kind, the kind angels have — their ability to tell what is true and good, what comes from the Lord, what comes from themselves, and what the source and nature of their thoughts, words, and deeds is, when these come from themselves.<br />I was allowed to talk with the descendants of the earliest church about their ability to perceive. They said they did not and could not think anything on their own or will anything on their own. With each and every thought or impulse, they said, they can tell what comes from the Lord and what comes from somewhere else. They perceive not only how much is from the Lord and how much is seemingly from themselves but also (when it does seem to originate in themselves) where it comes from. That is, they perceive which angels it comes from, what those angels are like, what all their different thoughts are, and so what the various influences are, along with countless other factors.<br />Perceptions of this kind come in many varieties. Heavenly angels, who love the Lord, perceive goodness, and this enables them to perceive everything that is a matter of truth. Since they perceive truth from the standpoint of what is good, they do not allow any discussion of truth (let alone argument about it) but say yes or no.{*1} Spiritual angels, on the other hand, who also have perception (though not the kind heavenly angels have), do talk about truth and goodness. They still perceive things, but they perceive them in many different ways, because this kind of perception has countless variations. The variations have to do with perceiving whether the Lord wills a thing or accepts it or tolerates it — which are quite different from each other.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This resistance to discussion beyond a simple yes or no echoes <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1384/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_37" target=_top>Matthew 5:37</a>: "Your conversation shall be ‘Yes, yes,' ‘No, no.' Anything beyond these comes from evil." Swedenborg often associates this verse with heavenly angels; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1384/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202" target=_top>202</a> is one instance.

As regards the first kind of perception, which is angelic, and which consists in perceiving what is true and good, also what is from the Lord and what from the persons themselves; and also in perceiving 
the source and quality of their thoughts, words, and actions, when these are from themselves-it has been granted me to converse with the sons of the Most Ancient Church concerning their perception. 
They said that of themselves they neither think nor can think anything, nor of themselves will anything; but that in all things whatever which they think and will, both in general and in particular, 
they perceive what comes from the Lord, and what from other sources; and they perceive not only how much is from the Lord, and how much is as from themselves, but also, when it is as from themselves, 
they perceive whence it is, from what angels, and likewise the quality of the angels and what their thoughts are, distinguishing every difference; thus they perceive what the influx is, and numberless 
other things. Perceptions of this kind exist in much variety. With the celestial angels, who are in love to the Lord, there is a perception of good, and from this, of all things of truth; and as they 
perceive truth from good, they do not admit of any speaking, and still less of any reasoning, about truth; but they say that it is so, or that it is not so. Whereas the spiritual angels, who likewise 
have perception, although not such as the celestial have, speak concerning truth and good; but still they perceive them, although with a difference; for there are innumerable varieties of this perception, 
the varieties having reference to their perception as to whether a thing is of the Lord's will, as to whether it is of His leave, or as to whether it is of His permission, all of which are perfectly 
distinct from each other. </p>

As to the first kind - the angelic, which consists in the angels perceiving what is true and good, perceiving what is from the Lord and what from self, and perceiving the source and nature of their own 
thoughts, speech, and actions when these spring from self - I have been allowed to talk to members<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the Most Ancient Church about their perception. They said that from themselves they neither think 
nor are able to think anything at all, and that from themselves do not will anything at all, but that in every single thing which they think or will they perceive what comes from the Lord and what 
from some other source. They also perceive, they have said, not only how much comes from the Lord and how much seemingly from themselves, but also when it seemingly comes from themselves, where it in 
fact comes from. They in that case perceive which angels it comes from, what is the character of those angels, and what their thoughts are, down to the smallest difference. Thus they perceive what the 
influx is, and countless other things. Perceptions of this kind exist in great variety. With celestial angels in whom love to the Lord reigns there is a perception of good, and from this of every aspect 
of truth. And because good is the source of the truth they perceive, they do not entertain any talk about truth, still less any reasoning about it, but simply say, It is so; or, It is not so; whereas 
spiritual angels, who also have perception, though not such as celestial angels have, are disposed to talk about truth and good. All the same, spiritual angels do perceive these, although with differences, 
for there are countless varieties of this perception. Such varieties are directly related to their perceiving whether something flows from the Lord's will, or from His consent, or from His 
permission - these being quite distinct from one another.

Primum genus quod angelicum est quod percipiant quid verum et bonum, percipiant quid a Domino et quid a semet, tum quod cogitant, loquuntur et agunt, cum a semet, unde et quale: loqui datum cum Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae filiis de illorum perceptione; dixerunt quod nihil ex se cogitent aut cogitare possint, et nihil ex se velint, sed quod percipiant omnia et singula quae cogitant et volunt, quid a Domino 
et quid aliunde; percipiantque non modo quantum a Domino et quantum velut a semet, sed etiam, cum velut a semet, undenam, a quibus angelis, tum quales angeli, quae eorum cogitata, cum omni differentia, 
ita qui influxus, et innumera alia.  Perceptiones hujus generis sunt cum multa varietate; apud angelos caelestes qui in amore in Dominum sunt, est perceptio boni, et inde omnium quae sunt veri; 
et quia ex bono percipiunt veram, non admittunt loquelam minus ratiocinationem de vero, sed dicunt ita esse, vel non ita esse; angeli vero spirituales qui quoque perceptionem habent sed non talem ut 
caelestes, loquuntur de vero et bono; sed usque percipiunt at cum differentia, nam varietates innumerabiles hujus perceptionis sunt; varietates se referunt ad haec quod percipiant num a Domini voluntate, 
num ex venia, et num ex permissione, quae perquam distincta inter se sunt. </p>
