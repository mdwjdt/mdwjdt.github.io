<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3200.</strong>这两节经文描述了理性良善期待如同新娘与丈夫那样与其联结的真理时的状态。接下来的这两节经文则描述了真理在接近并察觉到要与它联结的良善时的状态。不过，要知道，这些状态不止发生一次，而是在主在世的整个一生，直到祂得了荣耀期间不断发生。那些要重生的人也一样，因为他们不是在一个时间段内重生，而是整个一生，甚至在来世都在重生。事实上，人永远不可能得以完全。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3200</b></p><p><b>3200.</b>
In these two verses is described the state of rational good when it is in expectation of the truth that is to be conjoined with it as a bride to a husband. In the two verses which immediately follow, 
is described the state of truth when it is near, and perceives the good with which it is to be conjoined. But it is to be known that these states did not come forth once only, but continually during 
the Lord's whole life in the world, until He was glorified. The case is the same with the regenerate; for they are not regenerated at once, but continually during their whole life, and even in the other 
life; for man can never be perfected. </p>

These two verses describe the state of rational good when in expectation of truth that is to be joined to it as a bride to her husband. The two verses that follow next describe the state of truth when 
it is near and perceives the good to which it is to be joined. But it should be recognized that these states did not occur merely once but repeatedly throughout the Lord's entire life in the world until 
He had been glorified. The same applies also to those who are to be regenerated, for they are not regenerated in a single space of time but are being regenerated throughout their entire life, and 
even in the next life. In fact the perfecting of man can never be complete. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3200</b>
</p><b>3200.</b>
In binis his versibus describitur status boni rationalis, cum in exspectatione (t)veri est, quod sicut sponsa sibi marito conjungendum; in mox sequentibus binis versibus describitur status veri cum 
prope est ac percipit bonum cui conjungendum: sed sciendum quod hi status non semel exstiterint, sed continue per totam Domini vitam in mundo, usque dum glorificatus; apud regenerandos ita quoque se habet, 
non enim uno tempore regenerantur, sed continue per totam vitam, etiam in altera vita; perfici enim homo nusquam potest. </p>
