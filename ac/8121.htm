<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8121.</strong>但对邻之仁延伸的范围，远比帮助穷乏人广得多。对邻之仁包括在每项工作中做正确的事，在每个职位上尽到自己的职责。一个法官若为了正义而主持正义，就是在实行对邻之仁；他若惩罚有罪的人，释放无辜的人，就是在实行对邻之仁。因为他这样做是关心他的同胞、国家，也是关心主的国。他为了正义而主持正义是在关心主的国；释放无辜的人是在关心他的同胞；惩罚有罪的人是在关心他的国家。为了真理和良善而教导真理、引向良善的牧师就在实行仁爱；但是，为了自己和世界而如此行的人不是在实行仁爱，因为他爱的是自己，而非他的邻舍。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8121</b></p><p><b>8121.</b>
But charity toward the neighbor extends much more widely than to the poor and needy. Charity toward the neighbor consists in doing right in every work, and one's duty in every office. If a judge does 
what is just for the sake of justice, he exercises charity toward the neighbor; if he punishes the guilty and acquits the guiltless, he exercises charity toward the neighbor, for he thus consults the 
welfare of his fellow-citizen, of his country, and also of the Lord's kingdom. By doing what is just for the sake of justice he consults the welfare of the Lord's kingdom; by acquitting the guiltless, 
he consults that of his fellow-citizen; and by punishing the guilty, that of his country. The priest who teaches truth, and leads to good, for the sake of truth and good, exercises charity; but he who 
does such things for the sake of himself and the world does not exercise charity, because he does not love his neighbor, but himself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8121</b></p><p><b>8121.</b>
But charity towards the neighbour is far wider in scope than helping the poor and needy. Charity towards the neighbour involves doing what is right in every task, and doing what is required in any official 
position. If a judge administers justice for the sake of justice he exercises charity towards the neighbour; and if he punishes the guilty and acquits the innocent he exercises charity towards 
the neighbour. For in so doing he shows concern for his fellow citizen; he shows concern for his country, and also for the Lord's kingdom. He shows concern for the Lord's kingdom in his administration 
of justice for the sake of justice, he shows concern for his fellow citizen in his acquittal of the innocent, and he shows concern for his country in his punishment of the guilty. The priest who teaches 
truth and leads to good for the sake of truth and good exercises charity; but the one who does so for selfish and worldly reasons does not exercise charity because he does not love his neighbour, 
only himself. </p>

</p><b>8121.</b>
Sed charitas erga proximum multo latius se extendit quam ad pauperes et indigentes; charitas erga proximum est rectum facere in omni opere, ac debitum in omni officio; si judex justum facit propter 
justum, charitatem erga proximum exercet; si punit sontem et absolvit insontem, charitatem erga proximum exercet; nam sic consulit concivi, {1} consulit patriae, et quoque regno Domini, per facere justum 
propter justum regno Domini, per absolvere insontem concivi, et per punire sontem patriae.  Sacerdos qui docet verum et ducit ad bonum propter verum et bonum, is charitatem exercet; qui autem talia 
facit propter se et mundum, is charitatem non exercet, quia non amat proximum sed semet. 	@1 i et$ </p>
