<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10355节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10355</strong>.“你要和以色列人讲话，说”表通过圣言向那些属教会的人提供的信息。这从摩西和“以色列人”的代表，以及“讲话，说”的含义清楚可知：被吩咐和以色列人讲话的摩西是指圣言（参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节提到的地方）；“讲话，说”是指教导或信息（参看<a href="10280.htm">10280</a>节提到的地方）；“以色列人”是指教会（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节提到的地方）。由此明显可知，“你要和以色列人讲话，说”表示通过圣言向那些属教会的人提供的信息。<br />在此必须说一说如何通过圣言提供信息。在上古时代，人们通过与天堂天使直接联系获得关于天堂事物或永生事物的信息；因为在那些时代，天堂与教会的人行如一体。它通过他们的内在人流入他们的外在人，他们由此不仅拥有光照和觉察，还与天使交谈。“黄金时代”一词就用来描述这段时期；“金”表示这良善。在圣言中，伊甸园也用来描述这种状态。<br />后来，关于天堂事物和永生事物的信息通过诸如被称为对应和代表的那类事物来提供，关于它们的知识就来源于与天堂天使直接联系的上古之人。对那个时代的人们来说，天堂流入这些对应和代表，带来光照。因为对应和代表是天堂事物所取的外在形式；那时，人们在爱和仁之良善存在于他们里面的程度内接受光照。因为来自天堂的一切神性流注都进入与人同在的良善，并通过这良善进入那里的真理。由于那时教会的人处于属灵良善，而这良善本质上是真理，所以“白银时代”一词用来描述这些时代；因为“银”表示这种良善。<br />然而，当对应和代表的知识沦为巫术时，这个教会就灭亡了；第三个教会取而代之。在这个教会，诚然，一切敬拜都是用几乎一样的仪式来举行的；然而，它们所表示的东西，或说它们的内在含义却不得而知。这个教会建立在以色列和犹太民族当中。但由于关于天堂事物或永生事物的信息无法通过进入他们内层的流注，因而通过光照提供给他们，所以天上的天使通过口中的话语以一种活生生的声音向他们当中的一些人讲话，教导他们外在事物，但几乎不教导内在事物，因为他们无法理解这些内在事物。那些处于属世良善的人以一种神圣的方式接受这些外在事物。因此，“青铜”一词用来描述这些时代，因为“铜”表示这种良善。<br />但是，当教会成员当中连属世良善都不剩时，主就会降世，将天堂和地狱里的一切都恢复秩序。祂这样做的目的，是为了人能接受由祂那里从天堂而降的流注，并获得光照，地狱无法拦阻它并注入幽暗。这时，被称为基督教会的第四个教会诞生了。在这个教会，关于天堂事物或永生事物的信息唯独通过圣言来提供。人通过圣言获得流注和光照；圣言纯由对应和代表写成，它们表示天堂事物；当一个教会成员阅读圣言时，天堂天使便进入这些事物。因此，天堂与教会，或天堂天使与教会成员通过圣言实现结合；不过，天堂天使只与教会中那些处于爱和仁之良善的人结合。但是，由于该教会的成员也毁灭了这良善，所以通过来自这个源头的流注和光照来提供信息是不可能了，除了关于一些真理的信息之外；然而，这些真理与良善并不一致。因此，这些时代用“黑铁”一词来描述，因为“铁”表示在秩序的末后和最低层上的真理。但当真理变成这样时，其性质就符合但以理书中的描述：<br />既见铁与泥土搀杂，他们也必通过人的种混杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.43.htm">2:43</a>）<br />由此可见，启示是以哪种方式从上古时代直到现代接踵而来的；如今，启示唯独通过圣言被赋予。但真正的启示只临到那些为了真理而热爱真理的人身上，不会临到那些为了获得重要地位和金钱利益而热爱真理的人身上。事实上，你若愿意相信，主就是圣言本身，因为圣言是神性真理，神性真理来自主，故是天堂里的主。因此，那些为了神性真理而热爱神性真理的人是爱主的；对那些爱主的人来说，天堂流入并光照他们。但那些为了获得重要地位和金钱利益而热爱神性真理的人则从主转向自我和世界。因此，对这些人来说，流注或光照是不可能的。此外，由于当他们阅读圣言字义时，心思专注于自己，专注于自己的名声和荣耀，所以他们也利用字义来支持诸如偏向他们自己的爱的那类观念。</p>

And speak thou unto the sons of Israel, saying. That this signifies the informing by means of the Word of those who are of the church, is evident from the representation of Moses, who is commanded to 
speak unto the sons of Israel, as being the Word (see the places cited in n. 9372); from the signification of "speaking" and "saying," as being instruction or information (see the places cited in n. 
10280); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the church (of which in the places cited in n. 9340). From this it is evident that by the words, "speak thou to the sons of Israel, 
saying," is signified the informing of those who are of the church by means of the Word.  [2] Concerning information by means of the Word, something shall here be said. In the most ancient times men 
were informed about heavenly things, or those things which are of eternal life, by immediate interaction with the angels of heaven; for heaven then acted as a one with the men of the church, for it flowed 
in through their internal man into their external, and from this they had not only enlightenment and perception, but also speech with angels. This time was called the Golden Age, from men being then 
in the good of love to the Lord, for "gold" signifies this good. This state is also described in the Word by "Paradise."  [3] Afterward information about heavenly things and the things of eternal 
life was accomplished by means of such things as are called correspondences and representations, the knowledge of which was derived from the most ancient men, who had immediate interaction with the angels 
of heaven. Into these correspondences and representations heaven then flowed with men, and enlightened them. For correspondences and representations are the external forms of heavenly things, and 
insofar as men were then in the good of love and of charity, so far they were enlightened. For all Divine influx from heaven is into the good with man, and through the good into the truths; and because 
the man of the church was then in spiritual good, which good in its essence is truth, therefore those times were called the Silver Age, for "silver" signifies such good.  [4] But when the science 
of correspondences and of representations was turned into magic, that church perished, and a third church succeeded in which indeed almost all the worship was performed by similar observances; but still 
it was not known what they signified. This church was instituted with the Israelitish and Jewish nation. But as information about heavenly things, or those of eternal life, was not possible with the 
men of this church by influx into their interiors, and thus by enlightenment, therefore angels from heaven spoke with some of them in a living voice, and instructed them about external things; but 
very little about internal things, because these they could not apprehend. Those who were in natural good reverently received the things taught them, and from them these times were called Brazen, for 
"brass" signifies such good. [5] But when not even natural good remained with the man of the church, the Lord came into the world and reduced into order all things in the heavens and in the hells, to 
the end that man may receive influx from Him out of heaven and be enlightened; and that the hells should not be able to hinder, and infuse thick darkness. Then a fourth church began, which is called 
the Christian Church In this church their information about heavenly things, or about those of eternal life, is effected solely by means of the Word. Thereby man has influx and enlightenment; for the 
Word has been written by means of mere correspondences, and by means of mere representatives, which signify heavenly things. Into these come the angels of heaven when the man of the church reads the Word; 
consequently there is effected through the Word the conjunction of heaven with the church, or of the angels of heaven with the men of the church; but only with those therein who are in the good of 
love and of charity. But inasmuch as the man of this church also has extinguished this good, therefore neither can he be informed by any influx, and by enlightenment therefrom, except about a few truths, 
which however do not cohere with good. Therefore these times are what are called Iron, for "iron" denotes truth in the ultimate of order. But when truth is of such a quality, it is then such as 
is described in Daniel: </p>
<p>     In that thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by means of the seed of man; but they shall not cohere the one with the other, even as iron is 
not mingled with clay (Dan. 2:43). [6] From this it can be seen in what manner revelations have succeeded one another from the most ancient ages to the present time; and that at this day revelation 
is given solely through the Word, and genuine revelation solely with those who are in the love of truth for the sake of truth, and not with those who are in the love of truth for the sake of honors and 
profit as ends. For, if you will believe it, the Lord is the Word itself, because the Word is Divine truth, and Divine truth is the Lord in heaven, because it is from the Lord. Wherefore they who love 
Divine truth for the sake of Divine truth, love the Lord; and with those who love the Lord heaven flows in and enlightens them. Whereas they who love Divine truth for the sake of honors and profit 
as ends, turn themselves away from the Lord to themselves and to the world, for which reason there can be with them no influx and enlightenment. Moreover, as these, when dwelling on the sense of the letter, 
keep the mind fixed upon themselves and their own reputation and glory, they apply this sense to such things as favor their own loves. </p>

'And you, speak to the children of Israel, saying' means information provided by means of the Word to those who belong to the Church. This is clear from the representation of Moses, the one who is being 
told to speak to the children of Israel, as the Word, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>; from the meaning of 'speaking' and 'saying' as instruction or information, dealt with in the places 
referred to in <a href="10280.htm">10280</a>; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as the Church, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>. From all this it is evident that 'you, speak to the children 
of Israel, saying' means information by means of the Word to those who belong to the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Something must be stated here about the way information is provided by means of the Word. In the 
most ancient times people received information about heavenly matters, or those which belong to eternal life, through direct contact with the angels of heaven; for in those times heaven acted as one 
with people of the Church. It flowed through their internal man into their external, as a result of which they not only possessed enlightenment and perception but also talked to angels. The term 'the 
golden age' is used to describe this period of time, because people then were governed by the good of love to the Lord; for gold is the sign of that good. Paradise in the Word also serves to describe 
these things.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Afterwards information about heavenly matters and those which belong to eternal life was provided through the kinds of things that are termed correspondences and representations, 
knowledge of which they derived from the most ancient people who had the direct contact with the angels of heaven. With the people of that time those were the things into which heaven flowed, bringing 
enlightenment. For correspondences and representations are the outward forms that heavenly realities take; and people received enlightenment then to the extent that the good of love and charity was 
present in them. For all Divine influx from heaven passes into the good that exists with a person, and through that good into the truths there. And since people of the Church then were governed by spiritual 
good, which in essence is truth, the term 'the silver age' is used to describe those times; for silver is the sign of such good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 When the knowledge of correspondences and representations 
however was turned into magic that Church passed away and a third one took its place. In this Church all the worship did, it is true, involve the practice of things that were almost the same; nevertheless 
the inner meanings of them were not known. This Church was established among the Israelite and Jewish nation. But since information about heavenly matters or those which belong to eternal life 
could not be provided to them by influx into their interiors, and so by enlightenment, angels from heaven spoke to certain of them by word of mouth, giving them instruction about outward things, and 
little about inner realities, because they were incapable of comprehending inner realities. Those of them who were governed by natural good received those outward things in a holy manner. The term 'bronze' 
is therefore used to describe those times, for bronze is the sign of such good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But when no natural good either was left among members of the Church the Lord came into the world and restored 
all things to order in the heavens and in the hells. He did so to the end that a person could receive influx from Himself out of heaven and have enlightenment, and the hells could not intercept it 
and introduce thick darkness. At this point a fourth Church, called Christian, came into being. In this Church information about heavenly things or those which belong to eternal life is provided solely 
by means of the Word. The Word is the means by which a person receives influx and enlightenment; for in the writing of the Word pure correspondences and representatives were used, which are signs 
of heavenly things, and into these the angels of heaven come when a member of the Church reads the Word. Consequently the Word is the means by which heaven is joined to the Church, or the angels of heaven 
to members of the Church, yet only to those there in whom the good of love and charity is present. But since members of this Church as well have annihilated this good no information can be provided 
by means of influx and enlightenment from that source, apart from information regarding some truths, which do not however cohere with good. These times are therefore those which the term 'iron' is 
used to describe, for 'iron' means truth on the last and lowest level of order. But when truth comes to be such as this the nature of it fits the description in Daniel,  </p>
<blockquote>
[Just as] the iron which you 
saw was mixed with the miry clay, they will mingle through the seed of man (homo)<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, but they will not cohere with one another, just as iron is not mingled with clay. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:43</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From all this 
it may be seen how forms of revelation have followed one after another from the earliest eras down to the present, and that at the present day revelation is given through the Word alone. But true revelation 
comes to those who love truth for its own sake, not to those who love truth with a view to acquiring important positions and monetary gain. For if you are willing to believe it, the Lord is the 
Word itself, because the Word is Divine Truth and Divine Truth, since it comes from the Lord, is the Lord as He exists in heaven. Consequently those who love Divine Truth for its own sake love the Lord, 
and with those who love the Lord heaven flows in and brings enlightenment. But those who love Divine Truth with a view to acquiring important positions and monetary gain turn away from the Lord towards 
self and the world. With these therefore no influx or enlightenment is possible. And because when they read the literal sense of the Word they keep their minds fixed on themselves, and on their 
own reputation and glory, they also use that sense to support ideas such as favour their own loves.

`Et tu loquere ad filios Israelis, dicendo': quod significet informationem eorum qui ab Ecclesia per Verbum, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' ad quem dicitur quod loqueretur ad filios Israelis, 
quod sit Verbum, de qua in locis citatis, n. 9372, ex significatione `loqui' et `dicere' quod sit instructio seu informatio, de qua in locis citatis n. (x)10,280, et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' 
quod sint Ecclesia, de qua in locis citatis n. 9340; inde patet quod per `tu loquere ad filios Israelis, dicendo' significetur informatio eorum qui ab Ecclesia per Verbum. 	[2] De informatione 
per Verbum hic aliquid dicetur: antiquissimis temporibus informabantur homines de rebus caelestibus seu de illis quae sunt vitae aeternae, per immediatum commercium cum angelis caeli, nam caelum tunc 
unum agebat cum homine Ecclesiae, influebat enim per internum hominem in externum eorum, inde {1}illis non solum illustratio et perceptio sed etiam loquela cum angelis; {2}hoc tempus vocabatur saeculum 
aureum, ex eo quod tunc essent in bono amoris in Dominum, aurum enim significat id bonum; describuntur etiam illa per paradisum in Verbo. Postea informatio de rebus caelestibus, {3}et de illis quae 
sunt vitae [3] aeternae, fiebat per {4} talia quae {5}vocantur correspondentiae et {6}repraesentationes, quarum scientiam traxerunt (c)ab antiquissimis, qui immediatum commercium habebant cum angelis 
caeli; in illas tunc influebat caelum apud illos, (c)ac illustrabat; correspondentiae enim et {7}repraesentationes sunt formae externae caelestium; et quantum tunc homines in bono amoris et charitatis 
erant, tantum illustrabantur; omnis enim influxus Divinus e caelo fit in bonum apud hominem, (c)et per bonum in vera; et quia homo Ecclesiae tunc in bono spirituali erat, quod bonum est in sua essentia 
verum, ideo tempora illa vocabantur {8}saeculum argenteum, nam `argentum' significat tale bonum. 	[4] Sed cum scientia correspondentiarum et repraesentationum versa est in magiam, periit illa Ecclesia, 
et successit tertia, in qua quidem omnis cultus fiebat paene per similia, sed usque ignorabatur quid significabant; haec Ecclesia instituta fuit apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam, {9}sed quia 
informatio de rebus caelestibus seu de illis quae sunt vitae {10}aeternae, apud illos non potuit fieri per influxum in interiora eorum, et sic per illustrationem, ideo angeli e caelo loquebantur {11}viva 
voce cum quibusdam eorum, (c)et instruebant {12} de externis, (c)ac parum de internis, quia interna non capere potuerunt; illi qui in bono naturali erant recipiebant illa sancte, inde tempora illa 
vocabantur aerea, `aes' enim significat tale bonum. 	[5] {13}Ast' cum nec bonum naturale apud hominem Ecclesiae residuum esset, venit Dominus in mundum ac {14}redegit omnia in caelis et in infernis 
in ordinem, ob finem ut homo {15}posset recipere influxum ab Ipso e caelo, ac illustrari, nec inferna possent inhibere, ac immittere caliginem; tunc incepit quarta Ecclesia, quae vocatur Christiana; 
in hac informatio de rebus caelestibus {16}seu de illis quae {17}sunt vita aeternae, unice fit per Verbum; per illud fit influxus et illustrati homini, nam Verbum conscriptum est (x) per meras correspondentias 
et per mera repraesentativa, quae {18}significant caelestia, in quae angeli caeli veniunt cum homo Ecclesiae legit Verbum; inde per Verbum fit conjunctio caeli cum Ecclesia, seu angelorum 
caeli cum hominibus Ecclesiae, sed cum illis solum ibi qui in bono amoris et charitatis sunt; verum quia homo hujus Ecclesiae etiam exstinxit hoc bonum, ideo nec informari potest per aliquem influxum 
et per illustrationem inde, solum de aliquibus veris, quae tamen cum bono non cohaerent; inde haec tempora sunt quae vocantur ferrea, `ferrum' enim {19}est verum in ultimo ordinis; sed cum verum tale 
est, tunc est quale describitur apud Danielem, 	Quod vidisti ferrum mixtum cum argilla luti, commiscebunt se per semen hominis, sed non cohaerebunt unum cum altero, quemadmodum ferrum non commiscetur 
cum argilla, ii 43. [6] Ex his constare potest quomodo revelationes {20} successerunt ab antiquissimis aevis ad hodiernum, et quod hodie detur revelatio solum per Verbum, sed genuina revelatio apud 
illos qui in amore veri sunt propter verum, et non apud illos qui in amore veri sunt propter honores et lucra ut fines; nam si credere velitis, est Dominus ipsum (x)Verbum, quoniam Verbum est Divinum 
Verum {21}, et Divinum Verum est Dominus in caelo, quia a Domino; quapropter qui amant Divinum Verum propter Divinum Verum, amant Dominum, et apud illos qui amant Dominum, influit caelum ac illustrat, 
at illi qui amant {22}Divinum Verum propter honores et lucra ut fines, avertunt se a Domino ad semet et ad mundum, quare apud illos non dari potest influxus et illustratio; hi quoque {23}quia in sensu
