<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8246.</strong>他们说，我们地球人的脸并不漂亮。他们惊讶地发现，其中一些人脸上长满疣和粉刺，以及其它方面的毁容；他们说，这种缺陷在他们中间是看不到的。不过，他们的确喜欢一些脸，就是愉快而微笑的脸，以及嘴唇周围微微撅起的脸。</p>

They said that the faces of the men of our earth are not beautiful; and they wondered that the faces of some of them are full of warts and pimples, and are in other respects disfigured; and they said 
that none such ever appear among them. Still, they were pleased with some of the faces, namely, those which were cheerful and smiling, and those which were a little prominent about the lips. </p>

Speaking about the faces of people belonging to our planet they said that they were not beautiful. They were astonished that the faces of some were covered with warts and pimples, as well as being disfigured 
in other ways; they said that no such defects were ever seen among themselves. They did nevertheless like some faces, namely those which were cheerful and smiling, and those which jutted out 
slightly around the lips. </p>

De faciebus hominum nostrae telluris dicebant quod non pulchrae essent; ac mirati quod {1}aliquorum facies essent verrucosae (c)et pustulatae, {2}tum aliter deformatae; dicebant quod apud illos nusquam 
tales appareant; quaedam facies usque arridebant, nempe quae hilares (c)et ridentes erant, et quae circum labra paulum prominebant. 	@1 aliquae$ 	@2 aut$ </p>
