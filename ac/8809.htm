<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8809节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8809.</strong>“不可亲近女人”表信之良善的洁净。这从以下事实清楚可知，以色列民族当中的婚姻是不洁的，因为他们的内层是污秽的。婚姻之爱是从良善与真理的婚姻那里降下来的；因此，那些内层没有良善或真理在里面的人没有纯洁的婚姻；那些内层有邪恶和虚假在里面的人，如以色列民族，则有不洁的婚姻。这就是为何“不可亲近女人”表示禁绝不洁之物。婚姻之爱是从天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻那里降下来的（参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>，<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>，<a href="4835.htm">4835</a>节）；出身于雅各的百姓当中没有任何真正的婚姻之物，所以他们可以娶多个妻子（<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>节）。不过，就那些属于属灵教会，在此由以色列人所代表的人而言，他们在拥有被植入他们良善的真理之前，也没有任何真正的婚姻之物在里面。在这种情况发生之前，婚姻的确存在；但它不是纯洁的婚姻，因为在此之前，他们的内层里面没有良善与真理的婚姻。正因如此，“不可亲近女人”在内义上表示在信之良善方面被洁净。因为本章论述的主题是还没有真理植入其中的良善，随后的章节论述的主题则是实际的植入。</p>

Come not near unto a woman. That this signifies the purification of the good of faith, is evident from the fact that the marriages with the Israelitish nation were impure, because their interiors were 
filthy; for conjugial love descends from the marriage of good and truth; and therefore those who as to the interiors are not in good and truth cannot be in pure marriage; and they who as to the interiors 
are in evil and falsity, as was that nation, are in impure marriage. Hence it is that "not to come near unto a woman" denotes to abstain from what is impure. (That conjugial love descends from the 
heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth, see n. 2727-2759, 2803, 3132, 4434, 4835; and that with the people descended from Jacob there was not anything conjugial, and therefore it was permitted 
them to have more than one wife, n. 3246.) But as regards those who are of the spiritual church and are here represented by the sons of Israel, neither are they in anything conjugial until with 
them truth has been implanted in good. Before this is the case, there is indeed marriage, but not pure marriage, for in the interiors there is not before this a marriage of good and truth. Hence it 
is that by "not to come near unto a woman" is signified in the internal sense to be purified as to the good of faith; for in this chapter the good in which truth has not yet been implanted is treated 
of, and in the following chapters the implanting. </p>

'Do not go near a woman' means purification of the good of faith. This is clear from the consideration that marriages among the Israelite nation were impure because their interiors were foul. Conjugial 
love descends from the marriage of goodness and truth; consequently pure marriage does not exist with those whose interiors have no goodness or truth in them, and impure marriage exists with those 
whose interiors have evil and falsity in them, as that nation's did. This is why 'not going near a woman' means abstaining from impurity Regarding the descent of conjugial love from the heavenly marriage, 
which is the marriage of goodness and truth, see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, <a href="4835.htm">4835</a>; and regarding the absence of anything of true marriage among the people descended from Jacob, who were therefore 
allowed to take a number of wives, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a> But so far as those who belong to the spiritual Church are concerned, and who are represented here by the children of Israel, they do not have anything of true 
marriage in them until they have had truth implanted in their good. Before this happens a marriage does, it is true, exist, but it is not pure because up to then no marriage of goodness and truth exists 
in their interiors So it is that 'not going near a woman' in the internal sense means being purified in respect of the good of faith. For the subject in the present chapter is good which has not 
as yet had truth implanted in it, and in subsequent chapters the actual implanting. </p>

`{1}Ne accedatis ad mulierem': quod significet purificationem boni fidei, constat ex eo quod conjugia apud gentem Israeliticam essent impura, quia interiora eorum erant foeda; amor enim conjugialis 
descendit (c)ex conjugio boni et veri; quare illi qui quoad interiora non in bono et vero sunt, nec in conjugio puro esse possunt, et qui quoad interiora in malo et falso sunt, ut illa gens, in conjugio 
impuro sunt; inde est quod `non accedere ad mulierem' sit abstinere ab impuro; quod amor conjugialis descendat ex conjugio caelesti, quod est boni et veri, videatur n. 2727-2759, 2803, 3132, 4434, 
(x)4835, et quod apud populum ex Jacobo non aliquod conjugiale fuerit, ac ideo illis permissum plures uxores ducere, n. 3246.  Quod autem concernit illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, {2}et per filios 
Israelis hic repraesentantur, nec illi sunt in aliquo conjugiali priusquam apud illos verum implantatum est bono; antequam hoc fit, quidem conjugium est sed non purum, nam in interioribus non prius 
est conjugium boni et veri; inde est quod per `non accedere ad mulierem' in sensu interno {3}significetur purificari quoad bonum fidei; nam agitur in hoc capite de bono cui nondum verum implantatum 
est, et in sequentibus de implantatione. @1 Et nec A, Et ne IT, but cp p 166 line 3 and n. 8804.  A deleted draft of n. 8809 also reads Ne$ @2 qui$ @3 sit$ </p>
