<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8707.</strong>“让他们知道当走的路”表聪明之光和由此所过的生活。这从“路”和“他们当走”的含义清楚可知。“路”论及对真理的理解（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节），在此是指更内在层级上的，因为它论及对属灵教会成员由于来自主的真理的直接流注而拥有的真理的理解，这种流注不会给一个人带来对真理的任何实际洞察，只带来赋予他理解力的光。这光的情况类似于肉眼和视觉所依赖的光；为叫眼睛能看见物体，必须有一种光能向周围提供光照；眼睛在这光中看见并辨别物体，被由于它们符合真正秩序的美丽和快乐打动。内眼的视觉，就是理解力，也是这种情况；为叫这视觉，就是理解力能看见，也必须有一种光向周围提供光照；在这光中，作为聪明和智慧的事物的物体能显明自身。这光的源头就是直接从主发出的神性真理（参看<a href="8644.htm">8644</a>e节）。呈现在这光中的物体照着它们符合各人良善的程度而显得美丽、快乐。“他们当走”，也就是当在光中走，是指由此所过的生活。“走”在内义上表示生活（参看<a href="3335.htm">3335</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5493.htm">5493</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>，<a href="8417.htm">8417</a>，<a href="8420.htm">8420</a>节）。</p>

And make known to them the way wherein they must walk. That this signifies the light of intelligence, and the consequent life, is evident from the signification of "the way," as being predicated of the 
understanding of truth (see n. 627, 2333), here in an interior degree, because it is predicated of the understanding which the man of the spiritual church has from the immediate influx of truth from 
the Lord, from which there is no perception of truth, but light which gives the capacity of understanding. It is with this light as with the light of the sight of the eye; in order that the eye may 
see objects, there must be a light from which there is a general illumination. In this light the eye sees and discerns objects, and is affected with beauty and delight according to their agreement with 
order. The case is similar with the sight of the internal eye, which is the understanding; in order that this may see, there must also be a light from which there is a general illumination, in which 
come into view the objects which are the things of intelligence and wisdom. This light is from the Divine truth which proceeds immediately from the Lord (see n. 8644). The objects presented in this light 
appear beautiful and delightful according to their agreement with each person's good. And from the signification of "wherein they must walk," that is, in the light, as being the consequent life. 
(That in the internal sense "to walk" denotes life, see n. 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605, 8417, 8420.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8707</b></p><p><b>8707.</b>
'And make known to them the way in which they must go' means the light of intelligence and the life led as a result of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'the way' as that which has reference to the 
understanding of truth, dealt with in <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>, in this instance on a more internal level since it has reference to the understanding of truth which a member of the spiritual Church possesses as a 
result of the direct influx of truth from the Lord, an influx which does not bring a person any actual discernment of truth, only the light that enables him to use his understanding (the situation with 
this light is as it is with the light which the sight of the eye depends on. In order that the eye may see objects light is necessary, providing illumination all around; in this light the eye sees 
and discerns objects, and is struck by their beauty and delightfulness because of their accord with true order. The situation is similar with the sight of the inner eye which is the understanding, in 
order that this may see, light is again necessary, providing illumination all around, in which objects that are matters of intelligence and wisdom may manifest themselves. The source of this light is 
Divine Truth which goes forth directly from the Lord, see <a href="8644.htm">8644</a> (end); and objects in that light appear beautiful and delightful to the extent that they accord with the good anyone possesses); and from 
the meaning of 'in which (light) they must go' as the life led as a result. For the meaning of 'going' in the internal sense as life, see <a href="3335.htm">3335</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5493.htm">5493</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, <a href="8417.htm">8417</a>, <a href="8420.htm">8420</a>. </p>

`Et notam facias illis viam ibunt in qua': quod significet intelligentiae lucem et inde vitam, constat ex significatione `viae' quod praedicetur de intellectu veri, de qua n. 627, 2333, hic in interiore 
gradu, quia praedicatur de intellectu qui est homini Ecclesiae spiritualis ex influxu immediato veri a Domino, ex quo non est apperceptio veri, sed est lux quae dat facultatem intelligendi; cum {1}hac 
luce se habet sicut cum luce visus oculi; ut (t)videat oculus res objectas, erit lux ex qua illuminatio communis; in hac luce videt oculus et discernit objecta, et afficitur pulchritudine et jucunditate 
ex convenientia illorum cum ordine; similiter se habet cum visu oculi interni, qui est intellectus; ut hic videat, etiam erit lux ex qua illuminatio communis in qua apparent objecta quae sunt 
res intelligentiae et sapientiae; haec lux est a Divino Vero quod immediate a Domino procedit, videatur n. 8644 fin.; res objectae in illa luce apparent pulchrae et jucundae secundum convenientiam cum 
bono quod cuivis; et ex significatione `ibunt in qua,' nempe in luce, quod sit inde vita; quod `ire' in sensu interno sit vita, videatur n. 3335, 4882, 5493, (x)5605, 8417, (x)8420. 	@1 luce intelligentiae$ </p>
