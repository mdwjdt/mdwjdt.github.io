<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6295节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6295.</strong>“他也必成为一个人民，而且也要为大”表源于良善的那真理，因而属天人也要增长。这从“人民”和“为大”的含义，以及玛拿西的代表清楚可知：“人民”是指真理（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>，<a href="4619.htm">4619</a>节）；“为大”是指增长；玛拿西（这话就是指着他说的）是指属于属世层中的意愿并由内在所生的良善（参看<a href="6234.htm">6234</a>，<a href="6238.htm">6238</a>，<a href="6267.htm">6267</a>节）。源于良善的真理是属天人的一个标志，这一点从前面关于属天人的频繁阐述和说明清楚可知。也就是说，属天人就是在其意愿的引导下关心良善，并由此关心真理的人；他因以下事实而不同于属灵人：后者在其理解力的引导下而关心真理，并由此关心良善。由于“玛拿西”表示意愿的良善，故他代表属天人，准确地说，代表外在属天人，或外在属天教会的成员。因为“玛拿西”是属世层、因而外在人里面的意愿之良善，而“约瑟”是内在属天教会的成员，因为他代表理性层、因而内在人里面的意愿之良善。<br />有必要用几句话来说一说作为属天人标志的良善之真理。该真理虽被称为真理，其实却是良善。属天人有对主之爱的良善和对邻之爱的良善。对主之爱的良善形成他的内在部分，对邻之爱的良善形成外在部分。因此，属天教会成员当中那些处于对主之爱的人在该教会的内在部分，而那些处于对邻之爱的人则在外在部分。与属天人同在的这爱，即对邻之爱的良善就是在此被称为“良善之真理”的，由“玛拿西”来代表。因为属天人是这样：他不基于真理推理，甚至也不推理真理，因为他通过良善，也就是从主通过良善拥有对某事是真是假的觉知（参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="4448.htm">4448</a>节）。即便如此，与他同在的仁之良善仍是那被称为真理的，不过是属天真理。</p>

He also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great. That this signifies that truth from good also shall be increased, thus the celestial man, is evident from the signification of "people," 
as being truth (see n. 1259, 1260, 3581, 4619); from the signification of "becoming great," as being to be increased; and from the representation of Manasseh, of whom this is said, as being the good 
of the will in the natural, born from the internal (see n. 6234, 6238, 6267). That truth from good is of the celestial man, is evident from what has already been frequently said and shown with respect 
to the celestial man, namely, that the celestial man is one who is in good from the will, and from this in truth; and that he is distinguished from the spiritual man by the fact that the latter is in 
truth from the intellectual, and from this in good. And because "Manasseh" is the good of the will, therefore by him is represented the celestial man, but the external celestial man, or the man of the 
external celestial church; for "Manasseh" is the good of the will in the natural, thus in the external man; whereas "Joseph" is the man of the internal celestial church, because he is the good of the 
will in the rational, thus in the internal man. [2] In a few words something must be said of the truth of good which is of the celestial man. This truth is indeed called truth, but it is good. With 
the celestial man there is the good of love to the Lord and the good of love toward the neighbor. The good of love to the Lord is his internal, and the good of love toward the neighbor is his external. 
Therefore as regards the men who are of the celestial church, those are in the internal of this church who are in love to the Lord, and those are in its external who are in love toward the neighbor. 
The good of this love, namely, of love toward the neighbor with the celestial man, is what is here called the "truth of good," and is represented by Manasseh. For the celestial man is such that he does 
not reason from truth, nor about truth, because he has perception from good (that is, through good from the Lord) that a thing is so or is not so (see n. 202, 337, 2715, 3246, 4448); and yet the good 
of charity with him is what is called truth, but celestial truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6295</b></p><p><b>6295.</b>
'He too will be a people, and he too will become great' means that truth from good also, thus the celestial man, will be increased. This is clear from the meaning of 'a people' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>, <a href="4619.htm">4619</a>; from the meaning of 'becoming great as being increased; and from the representation of Manasseh, about whom these things are said, as good that belongs to the will in the natural 
and is born from the internal, dealt with in <a href="6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="6267.htm">6267</a>. The fact that truth from good is a mark of the celestial man is clear from what has often been stated and shown already about the celestial 
man. That is to say, it has been shown that the celestial man is one who, led by his will, has a concern for good, and from this for truth, and that he is different from the spiritual man, in 
that the latter, led by his understanding, has a concern for truth and from this for good. And since 'Manasseh' means good belonging to the will he represents the celestial man - the external celestial 
man or member of the external celestial Church, to be exact. For 'Manasseh' is good belonging to the will within the natural, thus within the external man, whereas 'Joseph' is the member of the internal 
celestial Church because he represents good belonging to the will within the rational, thus within the internal man. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let something also be said briefly about the truth of good, a mark of the 
celestial man. This truth is indeed called truth, but really it is good. Residing with the celestial man is the good of love to the Lord and the good of love towards the neighbour, the good of love 
to the Lord forming the internal part of him, the good of love towards the neighbour the external part. This being so, the members of the celestial Church in the internal part of that Church are those 
who are governed by love to the Lord, and those in the external part are those governed by love towards the neighbour. The good of the latter love - love towards the neighbour residing with the celestial 
man - is what is here being called the truth of good and is represented by 'Manasseh'. For the celestial man is one who does not reason from truth, or even about truth, since he is able to perceive 
from good, that is, from the Lord through good, whether something is true or not true, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="377.htm">377</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="4448.htm">4448</a>. Even so, the good of charity residing with him is what is called truth, but celestial truth. </p>

`Etiam hic erit {1}in populum, et etiam hic magnus fiet':  quod significet quod verum ex bono etiam augebitur, ita caelestis homo, constat ex significatione `populi' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1259, 
1260, 3581, 4619; ex significatione `magnus fieri' quod sit augeri; et ex repraesentatione `Menashis' de quo illa dicuntur, quod sit bonum voluntarii in naturali natum ab interno, de qua n. 6234, 6238, 
6267; quod verum ex bono sit caelestis hominis, constat ex illis quae prius de caelesti homine saepe dicta et ostensa sunt; quod nempe caelestis homo sit qui ex voluntario in bono est et inde in vero; 
et quod distinguatur a spirituali homine in eo quod hic sit ex intellectuali in vero et inde in bono; et quia `Menasheh' est bonum voluntarii, ideo per illum repraesentatur caelestis homo, sed caelestis 
homo externus seu homo Ecclesiae caelestis externae, nam `Menasheh' est bonum voluntarii in naturali, ita in externo homine; `Josephus' autem est homo Ecclesiae caelestis internae, quia est bonum 
voluntarii in rationali, ita in interno homine.  [2] Paucis etiam dicendum est de vero boni quod est caelestis hominis:  verum illud quidem dicitur verum sed est bonum; apud caelestem hominem est bonum 
amoris in Dominum et bonum amoris erga proximum; bonum amoris in Dominum est internum ejus, at bonum amoris erga proximum est externum ejus; quapropter qui ab Ecclesia caelesti sunt, in Ecclesiae 
illius interno sunt qui in amore in Dominum, et in Ecclesiae externo qui in amore erga proximum; bonum hujus amoris, nempe amoris {2}erga proximum apud caelestem hominem, {3}est quod hic vocatur verum 
boni, et repraesentatur per `Menashen'; caelestis enim homo est talis ut non ratiocinetur ex vero, {4}nec de vero, nam perceptionem ex bono, hoc est, per bonum a Domino, habet quod ita sit vel non ita, 
n. 202, 337, 2715, 3246, 4448; attamen bonum charitatis apud illum est quod vocatur verum, sed caeleste verum. @1 see p. 546, ftnote 2$ @2 in$ @3 est before apud$ @4 et$ </p>
