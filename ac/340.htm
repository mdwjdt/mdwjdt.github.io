<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>340.</strong>“我得了一个人（男性），耶和华”，则表示对那些被称为“该隐”者而言，信单独作为某个事物被识别和承认，这一点从本章开头部分明显可知。以前，可以说他们不知道什么叫信，因为他们对信的一切有一种觉察。但当他们开始将信的教义挑明时，就拿出他们觉察到的东西，把它们降为教义，称之为“我得了一个人（男性），耶和华”，仿佛发现了新大陆。于是，之前刻在心上的东西变成了仅仅认知的问题。<br />古时，人们给每个新事物取名，以此阐明名字所包含的事物。因此，解释以实玛利之名的意义便说“耶和华听见她的苦情”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创16.11.htm">16:11</a>）；解释流便之名，便说“耶和华看见我的苦情”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.32.htm">29:32</a>）；解释西缅之名，便说“耶和华听见我失宠”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.33.htm">29:33</a>）；解释犹大之名，便说“这回我要赞美耶和华”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.35.htm">29:35</a>）；摩西筑了一座坛，取名“耶和华尼西”（就是耶和华是我旌旗的意思，出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.15.htm">17:15</a>）。同样，信的教义在此被称为“我得了一个人，耶和华”或“该隐”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]340.</strong> The opening summary of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337" target=_top>337</a>] establishes the meaning of she said, "I have acquired the man Jehovah," as the fact that faith among those called Cain was recognized and acknowledged as a thing in itself.<br />Before this it was as if people were unaware of what faith was, because they had a perception of everything involved in faith. When they started to create a distinct doctrine concerning faith, however, they drew out principles they had learned through perception, reduced them into a systematic theology, and named them "I have acquired the man Jehovah," as if they had stumbled onto some new thing. In this way they turned what had been written on their hearts into a set of facts.<br />In ancient times people gave a name to every new phenomenon and explained the significance of the names in just this way. They explained, for example, that Ishmael meant that Jehovah had heard Hagar's unhappiness (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340/bible_king-james-version_genesis_16_11" target=_top>Genesis 16:11</a>); that Reuben meant "Jehovah has seen my unhappiness" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340/bible_king-james-version_genesis_29_32" target=_top>Genesis 29:32</a>); that Simeon meant that Jehovah had heard Leah was not as well loved (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340/bible_king-james-version_genesis_29_33" target=_top>Genesis 29:33</a>); and that Judah meant "This time I will acclaim Jehovah" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340/bible_king-james-version_genesis_29_35" target=_top>Genesis 29:35</a>). The altar built by Moses was called "Jehovah my banner" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340/bible_king-james-version_exodus_17_15" target=_top>Exodus 17:15</a>). Here the actual doctrine concerning faith was called "I have acquired the man Jehovah," that is to say, Cain. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 340</b></p><p><b>340.</b>
That the words "I have gotten a man, Jehovah" signify that with such as are called "Cain" faith is recognized and acknowledged as a thing by itself, is evident from what was said at the beginning of 
this chapter. Previously, they had been as it were ignorant of what faith is, because they had a perception of all the things of faith. But when they began to make a distinct doctrine of faith, they took 
the things they had a perception of and reduced them into doctrine, calling it "I have gotten a man, Jehovah" as if they had found out something new; and thus what was before inscribed on the heart 
became a mere matter of knowing. In ancient times they gave every new thing a name, and in this way set forth the things involved in the names. Thus the signification of the name Ishmael is explained 
by the saying, "Jehovah hath heard her affliction" (Gen. 16:11); that of Reuben, by the expression, "Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction" (Gen. 29:32); the name Simeon, by the saying, "Jehovah hath 
heard that I was less dear" (Gen. 29:33); and that of Judah by, "This time will I praise Jehovah" (Gen. 29:35); and an altar built by Moses was called, "Jehovah my banner" (Exod. 17:15). In like manner 
the doctrine of faith is here denominated "I have gotten a man, Jehovah" or "Cain." </p>

That 'she said, I have gained a man, Jehovah' means that with those called Cain faith was known and acknowledged as something existing by itself is clear from what has been stated in the preliminary 
sections of this chapter.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Previously they had not so to speak known what faith was, for what they possessed was a perception of everything that constituted faith. But once they started to make distinct 
and separate doctrine out of faith they drew on things which had been with them matters of perception and reduced them to doctrine. This doctrine they called 'I have gained a man, Jehovah', as though 
they had come upon something new. So that which had previously been written on the heart was now made into factual knowledge. In early times people used to find a name for anything that was new, and 
used to attach explanations as to what such names embodied. For example, to indicate what Ishmael meant, the explanation was added, Jehovah hearkened to her affliction', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2016:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 16:11</a>; what Reuben meant, 
'Jehovah has seen my affliction', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2029:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 29:32</a>; what Simeon meant, 'Jehovah heard that she was less loved', ibid. Verse 33; and what Judah meant, 'This time I will confess Jehovah', ibid. Verse 35. The 
altar built by Moses was called 'Jehovah is my banner', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2017:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 17:15</a> And here likewise doctrine concerning faith is called 'I have gained a man, Jehovah', which is what Cain meant.

Quod 'dixit, Acquisivi virum, 'Jehovam' significet quod fides apud eos qui dicti Cain, cognita sit et agnita sicut res per se, constat ab illis quae in praemissis hujus capitis dicta sunt: prius quasi 
ignorarunt quid fides, quia perceptionem {x}omnium quae erant fidei, habebant; at cum distinctam doctrinam facere incipiebant de fide, tunc depromebant illa de quibus perceptionem habebant, et redigebant 
in doctrinam, et vocabant illam, 'Acquisivi virum, Jehovam,' sicut novum quoddam adinvenissent, ita scientificum factum, quod fuit inscriptum cordi. Unumquodvis novum antiquitus nomine vocabant, 
et quae involvebant nomina, sic explicabant; sicut quid Ismael significet, quod 'audiret Jehovah miseriam ejus,' Gen. xvi 11; quid Reuben, quod 'vidit Jehovah miseriam meam,' Gen. xxix 32; quid Simeon, 
quod 'audivit Jehovah, quod minus cara,' ibid. vers. 33; quid Jehudah, 'hac vice confitebor Jehovae,' ibid. vers. {x}35. Altare a Mose aedificatum, vocatum 'Jehovah vexillum, Exod. xvii 15; hic ipsa 
doctrina fidei vocata 'Acquisivi virum, Jehovam', seu Cain. </p>
