<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1940节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1940.</strong>“我必使你的种极其繁多”表理性人臣服于与良善联结的智性真理掌控时的繁殖。这从“种”的含义清楚可知，前面说过，“种”表爱与信（<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节）。但“种极其繁多”在此表示当理性臣服于内在或神性真理时，这理性中的爱之属天事物的繁殖。“繁多”论及真理，“繁殖”论及良善，这从前面的阐述和说明可以看出来（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>节）。不过，由于此处论述的是主，故“繁多”表示繁殖，因为祂理性中的一切真理都会变成良善，因而变成神性，这就是此处所论及的。人的情况则不然，他的理性是由主通过真理或对真理的情感形成的。这情感就是他的良善，他通过这良善行事。<br />人类理性里面的繁殖增多难以理解，除非了解流注的情况。对此，大体上可以这样说：如前所述，每个人里面都有一个内在人，一个介于中间的理性人和一个外在人。内在人就是他的核心层，他凭这核心层成为人，并有别于动物，动物没有这样的核心层。内在人可以说就是主，即主的属天和属灵事物进入人内的一道门和入口。那里所发生的一切不是这个人所能理解的，因为它完全超越人借以思考的理性。看似人自己的理性就从属于这核心层或内在人。来自主的爱与信的天堂之物就经由这内在人流入理性，然后经由这理性流入外在人中的记忆知识。不过，所流入的事物照各人的状态被接受。<br />若理性不顺从主的善与真，它要么窒息、要么排斥、要么滥用所流入的事物；当它们流入记忆的感官知识时，更是如此。这就是“种子落在路旁，或石头地上，或荆棘中”所表示的，如主所教导的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.3.htm">13:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.7.htm">7</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.3.htm">4:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.7.htm">7</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.5.htm">8:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.7.htm">7</a>）。不过，当理性顺从并信靠主，即祂的圣言时，这理性就象好土，或好地，种子落在里面就大量结实。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1940</b></p><p><b>1940.</b>
In multiplying I will multiply thy seed. That this signifies the fruitfulness of the rational man when it submits itself to the sovereign control of the interior man when this is adjoined to good, is 
evident from the signification of "seed," as being love and faith (spoken of before, n. 1025, 1447, 1610), but in the present case by "multiplying seed" is signified the fruitfulness of the celestial 
things of love in the rational, when the rational has submitted itself to interior or Divine truth. "Multiplication" is predicated of truth, and "fruitfulness" of good, as may be seen from what has already 
been said and shown (n. 43, 55, 913, 983). But as the Lord is here treated of, "multiplying" signifies becoming fruitful, because all the truth in His rational was made good, and thereby Divine, 
as is here declared concerning Him. It is otherwise in man, whose rational is formed by the Lord from truth or the affection of truth. This affection is his good, from which he acts.  [2] How the case 
is with man's rational in regard to multiplication and fruitfulness cannot be understood unless we know how the case is with influx, of which it may be said in a general way that in everyone there 
is an internal man, a rational man which is intermediate, and an external man, as before said. It is the internal man that is his inmost from which he is man, and by which he is distinguished from brute 
animals, which have not such an inmost; and it is as it were the door or entrance for the Lord, that is, for what is celestial and spiritual from the Lord, into man. What is going on there cannot 
be comprehended by the man, because it is above all his rational, from which he thinks. That rational which appears as man's own is subject to this inmost, or to this internal man, and into this rational 
through the internal man there inflow from the Lord the heavenly things of love and of faith, and through this rational they inflow into the memory-knowledges that are in the external man; but the 
things that inflow are received in accordance with the state of each person.  </p>
<p>[3] Now unless the rational submits itself to the Lord's goods and truths, it either suffocates, or rejects, or perverts 
the things that flow in; and this is still more the case when they flow into the sensuous knowledges of the memory. This is what is meant by seed falling on a highway, or upon a rocky place, or among 
thorns, as the Lord teaches (Matt. 13:3-7; Mark 4:3-7; Luke 8:5-7). But when the rational submits itself and believes the Lord, that is, His Word, the rational is then like good ground or earth, into 
which the seed falls and bears much fruit. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1940</b></p><p><b>1940.</b>
That 'I will multiply your seed greatly' means the fruitfulness of the rational man when it submits itself to the controlling power of the interior man allied to good is clear from the meaning of 'seed' 
as love and faith, dealt with already in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>. Here however 'multiplying seed' means the fruitfulness within the rational of the celestial things of love when the rational has submitted 
itself to truth that is interior or Divine. 'Being multiplied' has reference to truths but 'being fruitful' to goods, as is clear from what has been stated and shown already in <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>. But 
as the subject is the Lord, 'being multiplied' means being fruitful for the reason that all truth within His Rational became good and so Divine; and this is what is being referred to here. In man's case 
it is different - his rational is formed by the Lord from truth or the affection for truth. This affection is in him good from which he acts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards multiplication and fruitfulness within 
man's rational, this cannot be understood unless one knows about influx, regarding which the following may be said of it in general: Within everybody, as stated already, there is the internal man, 
the rational man, which is in the middle, and the external man. The internal man is the inmost part of him by virtue of which he is a human being and which makes him distinct and separate from animals, 
which do not possess that inmost part. The internal man is so to speak the door or entrance for the Lord, that is, for celestial and spiritual things that are the Lord's, to come into a person. What 
goes on there the individual cannot comprehend since it is entirely above his rational from which he thinks. To this inmost or internal man the rational which appears as the person's own is subordinate. 
Into this rational by way of that internal man flow heavenly things of love and faith from the Lord; and by way of this rational they flow on into the facts that belong to the external man. But how 
these things flowing in are received depends on the individual person's state.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Unless the rational is submissive to goods and truths that are the Lord's this rational either stifles, or rejects, 
or perverts the things that flow in, the more so when they flow into facts in the memory that are derived from sensory evidence. These things when so received are meant by the seed that falls either 
on the pathway, or over stony ground, or among thorns, as the Lord teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:3-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:3-7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:3-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:3-7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:5-7</a>. But when the rational is submissive and believes the Lord, that is, His Word, the 
rational is like the ground or good soil into which the seed falls and bears much fruit. </p>

`Multiplicando multiplicabo semen tuum': quod significet   fructificationem rationalis hominis cum se sub potestate interioris hominis adjuncti bono submittit, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod 
sit amor et fides, de qua prius n. 1025, 1447, 1610; hic autem significatur per `multiplicare semen' fructificatio caelestium amoris in rationali quando rationale se submiserit Vero Interiori seu Divino: 
`multiplicatio' praedicatur de veris, at `fructificatio' de bonis, ut constat ab illis quae dicta et ostensa sunt prius n. 43, 55, 913, 983; sed quia agitur de Domino, per `multiplicationem' significatur 
fructificatio, quia omne verum in Rationali Ipsius factum bonum, ita Divinum, quod hic praedicatur: aliter in homine cujus rationale ex vero aut affectione veri a Domino formatur, illa affectio 
est ejus bonum ex quo agit.  [2] Ut sciatur quomodo se habet multiplicatio et fructificatio apud hominem in ejus rationali, non intelligi potest nisi sciatur quomodo se habet cum influxu, de quo 
haec in genere: apud unumquemvis hominem est internus homo, est rationalis qui medius, et externus, ut prius dictum; internus homo est qui intimum ejus est ex quo est homo et per quem distinguitur a brutis 
animalibus quae tale intimum non habent, estque ille quasi porta aut introitus Domini, hoc est, caelestium et spiritualium Domini, in hominem; quid ibi peragitur, non capi potest ab homine quia 
est supra omne ejus rationale ex quo cogitat; huic intimo seu interno homini subjectum est rationale, quod apparet ut hominis proprium; in hoc influunt per internum illum hominem caelestia amoris et fidei 
a Domino; et per rationale hoc in scientifica quae sunt externi hominis; sed quae influunt, recipiuntur secundum statum cujusvis; [3] nisi rationale se submittat bonis et veris Domini, tunc quae 
influunt, rationale hoc vel suffocat, vel rejicit, vel pervertit, et adhuc magis cum influunt in scientifica sensualia memoriae; haec sunt, quod `semen vel cadat in viam, vel super petrosum, vel inter 
spinas,' sicut Dominus docet Matth. xiii 3-7; Marc. iv 3-7; Luc. viii 5-7; at cum rationale se submittit, et credit Domino, hoc est, Verbo Ipsius, tunc est rationale sicut `humus seu terra bona, in quam 
cadit semen, et multum fructum fert.' </p>
