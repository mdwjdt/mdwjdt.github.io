<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2511节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2511.</strong>“把撒拉取了去”表对请教理性的情感。这从作为“妹子”的撒拉和“取”的含义清楚可知：作为妹子的撒拉是指理性真理（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）；“取”则描述了对她的情感，因而就内义而言，描述了对请教理性的情感。本节内容体现了主对信之教义的最初思维，即请教理性是否有益。祂最初就是这么想的，这是因为主照整个神序发展；凡属祂生来所进入的人身，以及祂从母亲所得来之物都必须脱去，以便祂能披上神性。因此，人的这种思维，即对于信的教义是否应请教理性，也要脱去。</p>

And took Sarah. That this signifies the affection of consulting the rational, is evident from the signification of Sarah as a "sister," as being rational truth (see n. 2508); and also from the signification 
of "taking" her, as being from affection toward her; thus, in the internal sense, from the affection of consulting the rational. The things contained in this verse involve the Lord's first thought 
respecting the doctrine of faith, as to whether it would be well to consult the rational or not. The reason why the first thought was of such a character is that the Lord progressed according to 
all Divine order; and whatever was of the human into which He was born, and which He derived from the mother, must necessarily be put off in order that He might put on the Divine; thus also this human 
thought, namely, as to whether the rational was to be consulted in regard to the doctrinal things of faith. </p>

'And took Sarah' means the affection for consulting the rational. This is clear from the meaning of 'Sarah when a sister' as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, and also from 'taking her' as descriptive 
of affection towards her, and so in the internal sense of an affection for consulting the rational. The contents of this verse embody the Lord's initial thought regarding the doctrine of faith, whether 
it would be advantageous to consult the rational or not. The reason He initially thought this is that the Lord developed according to the whole of Divine order; and everything of the human into 
which He had been born and which He had derived from the mother had to be cast off by Him so that He might put on the Divine. Thus this human thought - whether in matters of doctrine regarding faith the 
rational should be consulted - had to be cast off as well. </p>

`Et accepit Saram': (x)quod significet affectionem consulendi rationale, constat ex significatione `Sarae ut sororis' quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 2508, tum ex `accipere illam' quod sit affectioni 
erga illam, ita in sensu interno, affectionis consulendi rationale. Quae in hoc versu continentur, involvunt primam cogitationem Domini de doctrina fidei, num conduceret consulere rationale, vel 
non; quod prima talis cogitatio esset, causa est quia Dominus secundum omnem ordinem Divinum progressus est, et quicquid {1} fuit humanum in quod natus et quod traxit a matre, hoc exuere debuit ut indueret 
Divinum; ita etiam hoc humanum, num {2} in doctrinalibus fidei consuleretur rationale. 	@1 quicquid enim.$ 	@2 A d num i quod.$ </p>
