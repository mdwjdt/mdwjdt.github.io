<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第828节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>828．有些男人最渴望奸污处女，也就是说，他们的最大乐趣是占有处女，夺走她们的贞操，而又不想娶她们，组建一个家庭；一旦夺去其贞操，他们就会抛弃、嫌恶之，使其沦为妓女。这种人在来生会遭受极其严厉的惩罚，因为他们的行为违背属世、属灵和属天的秩序，不仅违背在天堂被奉为最神圣的婚姻之爱，还违背天真无邪，他们通过将被赋予婚姻之爱的纯真少女诱入娼妓的生活而扼杀和摧毁这天真无邪。众所周知，正是这爱情的最初花朵使得处女进入贞洁的婚姻之爱，将夫妻双方的心智结合起来。由于天堂的圣洁建立在婚姻之爱和天真无邪的基础上，而这种男人内在却是杀人犯，所以在来生，他们会遭受极其严厉的惩罚。他们看似坐在一匹烈马上，这马把他们抛入空中，以致他们从马背上摔下来，其生命似乎陷入危险中，这就是击打他们的恐怖。之后，他们又看似在这匹烈马的肚子下面，旋即看似穿过马后臀进入马肚子。就在这时，他们忽然看似在肮脏的妓女肚子中。这妓女变成一条巨龙，他们在那里被包裹在痛苦折磨中。这种惩罚在几百年，甚至几千年中会重复很多次，直到他们对这类欲望充满恐惧。至于他们的后代，我被告知，他们比其他孩子更坏，因为他们从父亲那里获得某种类似的遗传。因此，这种人的交合很少生出孩子，并且生下来的孩子在这个世界也活不长。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]828.</strong> There are men who like nothing better than deflowering virgins — that is, who take the greatest pleasure in virgins and in robbing them of their virginity without any thought of marriage or children. When they have stolen the bloom of their virginity, they abandon them in disgust or prostitute them.<br />Men who have lived this kind of life have contravened the order of nature, of the spirit, and of heaven. They violate not only marriage love, a love held very sacred in heaven, but also innocence, which they wound and murder when they take innocent girls, who could have had the love of marriage instilled in them, and introduce them instead to the life of a whore. (People know that the first blossoming of love is what introduces young women to the chaste love in marriage and unites the minds of married partners.){*1} Because heaven's holiness is founded on marriage love and innocence, and these men are inward murderers (as described), in the other life they suffer punishment of the most severe kind. They seem to themselves to be riding a frenzied horse that bucks them up into the air, throwing them off, apparently in danger of their lives; such is the terror that strikes them. Later they see themselves under the belly of the maddened horse and soon seem to go up through the horse's rump into its stomach. Then suddenly it appears to them as if they are in the belly of a woman, a foul slut, who changes into a huge dragon.{*2} There they remain hidden and in pain. This punishment recurs many times over hundreds and thousands of years, until the offenders gain a horror for such desires.<br />I have heard that their children are worse than others, since they inherit this quality from their fathers. Accordingly, when people of this kind engage in sexual intercourse, it rarely produces offspring, and such babies as are born do not live long.{*3} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a discussion of how love unites the minds of marriage partners, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_179" target=_top>Marriage Love 179</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} This may be an echo of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/bible_king-james-version_revelation_17_1-5" target=_top>Revelation 17:1-5</a>, which refers to a "whore," "a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names." [RS]<br />{*3} The assertion that the children of seducers perish early is unusual to Swedenborg, and the specification that he has been told this by others is striking. He elsewhere (for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8550" target=_top>8550</a>) states that the impure habits of a parent are passed on to a child as evil, but the implication of such passages is that the evil has spiritual, not physical, consequences. In addition, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_392" target=_top>Marriage Love 392</a> he says that the Lord so orders the universe that even evil people love and care for their children. However, the actions of men such as are here described are counter to the ideal of faithful monogamy, a state that Swedenborg saw as divinely ordained for the generation of physical progeny (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_481" target=_top>Marriage Love 481</a>); so it is at least consonant with his theology that the intercourse of those who flouted married love should prove unproductive. A possible biblical parallel to this general rule can be seen in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_11_1-27" target=_top>2 Samuel 11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_12_1-31" target=_top>12</a>, where the child of David and Bathsheba that is conceived in adultery dies an infant, whereas the child they later conceive when they are married flourishes. Compare also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_828/bible_king-james-version_ecclesiasticus_24_22-25" target=_top>Ecclesiasticus 24:22-25</a>. Furthermore, the belief that the children of parents who engage in sexual irregularities are defective can be found in at least one other author of the early modern era (see the instance cited in Harvey 1994, 26). In any case, when children failed to thrive, it would have been logical to seek in the actions of the parents for an explanation. [SS] </p>

They who are possessed with the lust of defloration, and who find their greatest delight in virginities and the theft of them, without any purpose of marriage and offspring, and who when they have robbed 
virginity of its flower, afterwards forsake, loathe, and prostitute their victims, suffer the most grievous punishment in the other life, because such a life is contrary to order-natural, spiritual, 
and celestial; and because it is not only contrary to conjugial love, which is held in heaven to be most holy, but is also contrary to innocence, which they violate and kill by enticing the innocent, 
who might otherwise be imbued with conjugial love, into a meretricious life; for it is the first flower of love which introduces virgins into chaste conjugial love, and conjoins the minds of a married 
pair. And because the holiness of heaven is founded in conjugial love and in innocence, and such men are therefore interior murderers, they seem to themselves to be sitting upon a furious horse, 
which tosses them up so that they are thrown from the horse, to the peril of their life as it seems-such terror seizes them. Afterwards they appear to themselves to be under the belly of the furious horse, 
and presently seem to themselves to go through the hinder part of the horse into his belly; and then suddenly it appears to them as if they were in the belly of a filthy harlot, which harlot is 
changed into a great dragon, and there they remain wrapped in torment. This punishment returns many times during hundreds and thousands of years, until they are imbued with a horror of such desires. Respecting 
their offspring I have been told that they are worse than other children, because they derive from the father something of a like heredity; and therefore children are rarely born from such intercourse, 
and those that are born do not remain long in this life. </p>

Men who desire above all else to deflower virgins, that is, who delight most of all to take virgins and rob them of their virginity, without any intention of marrying them and having a family, and who 
once they have robbed them of the flower of their virginity afterwards abandon them, regard them as nauseating, and make prostitutes of them, [undergo very severe punishment in the next life].<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Men 
who have pursued this kind of life undergo that punishment because they have behaved in a way contrary to natural, spiritual, and celestial order - contrary not only to conjugial love, which in heaven 
is upheld as most holy, but also to the innocence they injure and destroy by leading innocent young women who could be endowed with conjugial love into a life of prostitution. It is well known that it 
is the first flower of love which leads virgins into chaste conjugial love and joins together the minds of married partners. And because the holiness of heaven is based on conjugial love and on innocence, 
and men of this kind are inwardly murderers, they undergo very severe punishment in the next life. It seems to them as though they are seated on a horse that is frenzied, which tosses them up in 
the air so that they are thrown from the horse and their life seemingly put in peril, such is the terror struck into them. After that it appears to them as though they are under the belly of the frenzied 
horse, and then it seems to them as though they pass by way of the horse's hindquarters into its belly. At this point it suddenly seems to them as if they are inside the belly of a filthy prostitute. 
The prostitute changes into a large dragon, and there they stay enveloped in torment. This punishment is repeated many times, over hundreds and thousands of years, until they are filled with horror 
for such desires. Concerning their offspring I have been told that these are worse than other people's children, for they derive something of a like heredity from their fathers. This also is why infants 
are rarely born from the sexual union of such persons, and those who are do not live very long in this world.

Qui nihil plus cupiunt quam deflorare virgines, seu quibus virginitates et virginitatum furta maximae jucunditati sunt, absque omni fine conjugii et prolis, et cum virginitatis florem furati, eas postea 
relinquunt, nauseae habent, prostituunt: {1}ii qui talem vitam egerunt, quia contra ordinem naturalem, spiritualem et caelestem, et quia non solum contra amorem conjugialem qui sanctissimus habetur 
in caelo, sed etiam contra innocentiam quam laedunt et occidunt, inducendo innocentes quae amore conjugiali imbui possent, in vitam meretriciam; notum est quod primus flos amoris est qui inducit virgines 
in amorem conjugialem castum et conjungit animos conjugum; et quia sanctitas caeli fundatur in amore conjugiali et in innocentia, et ii homicidae tales interiores sunt, poenam subeunt in altera 
vita gravissimam; videntur sibi equo furioso insidere, qui eos projicit sursum, sic ut ex equo dejiciantur cum discriminibus quasi vitae, terror talis incutitur; postea apparent sibi sub ventre equi 
furiosi, et mox subire sibi videntur per partem posteriorem equi in ventrem ejus, et tunc apparet iis subito quasi sint in feminae spurcae meretricis ventre, quae meretrix mutatur in magnum draconem, 
et ibi manent obvelati in cruciatu; haec poena multoties redit, intra centenos et millenos annos, usque dum talium cupiditatum horrore imbuuntur.  De eorum prole, mihi dictum, quod pejores sint infantibus 
aliis, quia aliquid hereditarium tale a patre trahunt; quare etiam raro infantes ex talium congressu nascuntur, et qui nascuntur, non diu remanent in vita. @1 Predicate is subeunt seven lines below.
