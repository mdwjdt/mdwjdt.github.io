<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6385节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6385.</strong>“在停船的港口”表有取自圣言的教义在其中。这从“港口”和“船”的含义清楚可知：“港口”是指停靠之地，如刚才所述（<a href="6384.htm">6384</a>节），因而是指这些教义所在之地；“船”是指取自圣言的教义。“船”之所以具有这种含义，是因为船只横渡海洋和江河，运送用于维持生活的货物。事实上，“海”与“河”表示各种不同的知识和记忆知识；船上所载的维持生活的货物或有用的东西是指教义，也是取自圣言的真正真理。“船”就表示这类教义和真理，这一点从以下经文明显看出来，在以赛亚书：<br />众海岛必信靠我，首先是他施的船只，他施的船领先，将你的众子连他们的金银从远方一同带来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.9.htm">60:9</a>）<br />“他施的船只”表示取自圣言的教义和真理，这就是为何经上说他们“将他们的众子连他们的金银一同带来”；因为“众子”表示那些拥有真理的人；“银”表示真理本身；“金”表示良善。谁都能看出，此处不是指他施的船只，也不是指众子和金银。<br />以西结书：<br />你的疆界在海心，造你的使你全然美丽。他们用示尼珥的松树做你的一切板，用黎巴嫩的香柏树给你作桅杆。用巴珊的橡树作你的桨，用象牙，就是基提海岛台阶上的女子，作你的舱板。你的帆是用埃及绣花细麻布做的，可以作你的大旗；你的篷是用以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布做的。西顿和亚发的居民作你划桨的。推罗啊，你的智慧人作掌舵的。迦巴勒的老者和智慧人，都在你中间作补缝的；一切海上的船只和水手，都在你中间经营交易的事。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.4.htm">27:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗表示良善与真理认知或知识（参看<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。这些认知或知识通过与船有关的东西来描述，如“板”、“桅杆”、“桨”、“舱板”、“帆”、“篷”、“划桨的”、“掌舵的”、“水手”。谁看不出，这一切不可照着字面来理解？但当把“船”理解为真理与良善的认知或知识，也就是“推罗”，以及取自圣言的教义时，那么所有这些事物就会优美地组合在一起。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，你所造的何其多！它们都是你用智慧造成的。那里有海，又大又广；那里有船行走，你所造的鲸鱼也嬉戏于其中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.24.htm">104:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.26.htm">26</a>）<br /><br />愿他们献感谢之祭；欢呼述说耶和华的作为。坐船下海，在多水中经理事务的，这些人看见耶和华的作为，并祂在深海中的奇事。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.22.htm">107:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.24.htm">24</a>）<br />此处“船”表示认知或知识和教义；“鲸鱼”表示记忆知识的总体源头（<a href="42.htm">42</a>节）；由于“船”是指认知或知识和教义，故经上说：他们“坐船下海，看见耶和华的作为，并祂在深海中的奇事”；因为那些知道取自圣言的这些认知或知识和教义的人看见这些作为和奇事。<br />启示录：<br />第二位天使吹号，就有仿佛火烧着的大山扔在海中，海的三分之一变成血。海中活物有灵魂的死了三分之一，船只的三分之一也坏了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.8.htm">8:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“火烧着的大山”表示自我之爱（<a href="1691.htm">1691</a>节）；“海”表示记忆知识所在的属世层（<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）；“血”表示向仁爱所施的暴行（<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>节）；“海中活物有灵魂的”表示包含记忆知识中的真理，以及良善；“三分之一”表示尚不完整的某种事物（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）；它们“死了”表示它们没有属灵生命（<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>节）；因此，“船只的三分之一也坏了”表示取自圣言的教义中的真理与良善被歪曲了。由此可知这段预言是什么意思。<br />但就反面意义而言，“船”表示虚假和邪恶的认知或知识和教义，如但以理书：<br />到了末期，南方王要与他交战；北方王必用战车、马兵和许多战船，势如旋风来攻击他，也必进入列国如洪水泛滥。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.40.htm">11:40</a>）<br />“南方王”表示源于良善的真理；“北方王”表示源于邪恶的虚假；“战车、马兵和战船”表示虚假的教义；“列国”表示诸教会，“到了末期”，源于邪恶的虚假就会“如洪水泛滥”于它所预言的这些教会。<br />启示录：<br />凡船主，和坐船的，并众水手，连所有靠海为业的，都远远地站着，.看见烧巴比伦的烟，就喊着说，有何城能比这大城呢？祸哉，祸哉，这大城阿。凡有船在海中的，都因她的奢侈成了富足。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.17.htm">18:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.19.htm">19</a>）<br />显然，“船”在此表示虚假与邪恶的认知或知识和教义，因为“巴比伦”表示表面神圣，内里亵渎的敬拜。此外，谁都能看出，“船”在此表示某种其它东西，而不是指船只。在以赛亚书也是如此：<br />耶和华你们的救赎主，以色列的圣者如此说，因你们的缘故，我已经打发人到巴比伦去，我要拆毁她一切的门闩，使迦勒底人都坐在他们欢呼的船上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.14.htm">43:14</a>）<br />除此之外，其它经文（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.11.htm">2:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.1.htm">23:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.14.htm">14</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗48.7.htm">48:7</a>）中的“船”也表示源于邪恶的虚假。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6385</b></p><p><b>6385.</b>
And he shall be at a haven of ships. That this signifies where are doctrinal things from the Word, is evident from the signification of "haven," as being a residence (see just above, n. 6384), thus where 
they are; and from the signification of "ships," as being doctrinal things from the Word. That "ships" have this signification is because they pass through seas and rivers, and carry things useful 
for life; for by "seas" and "rivers" are signified knowledges and memory-knowledges; the useful things of life which they carry, are the doctrinal things and also the very truths from the Word which 
are signified by "ships," as is plain from the following passages: </p>
<p>     The isles shall trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold 
with them (Isa. 60:9); </p>
<p>"ships of Tarshish" denote doctrinal things and truths from the Word, wherefore it is said that they should "bring their sons, their silver and gold;" for by "sons" are signified 
those who are in truths; by "silver," the truth itself; and by "gold," good. Everyone can see that ships of Tarshish are not here meant, nor sons, silver, and gold. [2] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thy borders 
are in the heart of the sea, thy architects have perfected thy beauty. They have built all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken the cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee. Of 
the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy beam of ivory; the daughter of a step from the Isles of Kittim. Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might 
be to thee for an ensign; blue and crimson from the isles of Elishah was thy covering. The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, who were in thee, were thy pilots. The 
elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy caulkers; all the ships of the sea and their sailors were in thee, to trade thy trading (Ezek. 27:4-9); </p>
<p>this is said of Tyre, by which are 
signified the knowledges of good and truth (see n. 1201), which are described by what belongs to a ship, as "planks," "mast," "oars," "beam," "sail," a "covering," "rowers," "pilots," and "sailors." That 
all these are not to be understood according to the letter must be plain to everyone; but when the knowledges of truth and good, which are "Tyre," together with doctrinal things from the Word, are 
understood by "ships," then all things fit together beautifully. [3] In David: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, how manifold are Thy works! in wisdom hast Thou made them all. This sea great and wide in spaces; there 
go the ships; the whale which Thou hast formed to play therein (Ps. 104:24-26). Again: </p>
<p>     Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of confession; and declare the works of Jehovah with rejoicing. They that 
go down to the sea in ships, that do work in many waters, these see the works of Jehovah and His wonders in the deep (Ps. 107:22-24);  here also "ships" denote knowledges and doctrinal things; the 
"whale" denotes the generals of memory-knowledges (n. 42); and as "ships" are knowledges and doctrinal things, therefore it is said, "they that go down to the sea in ships see the works of Jehovah and 
His wonders in the deep;" for those see these things who are in the knowledges and doctrinal things from the Word. [4] In Revelation: </p>
<p>     The second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain 
burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood, whence the third part of the creatures that were in the sea, and had souls, died; and the third part of the ships 
was destroyed (Rev. 8:8, 9);  the "great mountain burning with fire" denotes the love of self (n. 1691); the "sea," the natural where memory-knowledges are (n. 28); "blood," violence done to charity 
(n. 374, 1005); "creatures in the sea having souls," truths of memory-knowledge with goods; a "third part," something not yet complete (n. 2788); their "dying," that they had no spiritual life (n. 6119); 
hence "the third part of the ships being destroyed" denotes that the truths and goods of doctrinal things from the Word were falsified. From all this may be known what is signified by this prophecy. [5] 
But in the opposite sense "ships" signify the knowledges and doctrinal things of what is false and evil, as in Daniel: </p>
<p>     At the time of the end shall the king of the south strive with him; 
therefore the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariot and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall come into the lands, and shall overflow and penetrate (Dan. 11:40); </p>
<p>the 
"king of the south" denotes truth from good; the "king of the north," falsities from evil; "chariots with horsemen and with ships," doctrinal things of falsity; the "lands," churches, of which 
it is predicted that falsities from evils in the time of the end should overflow and penetrate them. [6] In Revelation: </p>
<p>     Every pilot, and everyone employed upon ships, and sailors, and all they 
who trade upon the sea, stood afar off, and cried when they saw the smoke of the burning of Babylon, saying, What city is like the great city? Woe, woe, the great city, wherein were made rich all 
that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! (Rev. 18:17-19); </p>
<p>it is evident that "ships" here denote the knowledges and doctrinal things of falsity and evil, because "Babylon" denotes worship 
which outwardly appears holy, and inwardly is profane. Moreover no one can fail to see that by "ships" something else than ships is here meant. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah your Redeemer, the 
Holy one of Israel, For your sake I have sent to Babylon, that I may throw down all her bars, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships (Isa. 43:14); </p>
<p>where the meaning is similar. Moreover falsities 
from evil are signified by "ships" in Isa. 2:11, 16; 23:1, 14; and in Ps. 48:7. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6385</b></p><p><b>6385.</b>
'And he will be at the haven of ships' means in which teachings drawn from the Word are present. This is clear from the meaning of 'the haven' as the resting-place, as immediately above in <a href="6384.htm">6384</a>, thus 
the place where those teachings are present; and from the meaning of 'ships' as teachings drawn from the Word. The reason Why they are meant by 'ships' is that ships sail across seas and along rivers, 
carrying commodities used to support life. For 'seas' and 'rivers' mean different kinds of knowledge; the commodities used to support life which the ships carry are teachings as well as actual truths 
drawn from the Word. The fact that such teachings and truths are meant by 'ships' is evident from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The islands will put their trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish 
at their head, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and their gold with them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The ships of Tarshish' stands for teachings and truths drawn from the Word. This is why it says that 
they would bring their sons, their silver and gold; for 'sons' means those in possession of truths, 'silver' truth itself, and 'gold' good. Anyone can see that the ships of Tarshish are not really meant 
here, and that sons, silver, and gold are not really meant either. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
In the heart of the sea are your borders, your architects have perfected your beauty. Of fir trees from Senir 
they built for you all the boards; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. Of oaks from Bashan they made oars; your plank they made of ivory, a daughter of steps<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from the isles of 
Kittim. Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you an ensign; violet and purple from the islands of Elishah was your covering. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad 
were your rowers; your wise men, O Tyre, who were in you were your pilots. Elders of Gebal and its wisemen were in you, remedying your cracks. All the ships of the sea and their sailors were in you, 
to conduct your trade. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2017:4-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 17:4-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means cognitions of good and truth, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. Those cognitions are described by means of the aspects of a ship - its boards, mast, oars, 
plank, sail, covering, rowers, pilots, and sailors. Who can fail to see that one must not take all these things literally? But when the cognitions of truth and good, which are 'Tyre', together with 
teachings drawn from the Word, are understood by 'ships', all things go beautifully together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
How many are your works, O Jehovah! In wisdom You have made them all. This sea, great 
and wide on both hands<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> - there the ships sail, the sea monster whom you have formed to play in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:24-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:24-26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of confession, and declare 
Jehovah's works in a triumphant shout. Those who go down to the sea with ships, doing work in many waters - these saw the works of Jehovah, and His marvels in the deep. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20107:21-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 107:21-24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 
'ships' stands for cognitions and religious teachings, 'the sea monster' for the general sources of known facts, <a href="42.htm">42</a>. And since 'ships' are cognitions and those teachings, the words 'those who go down 
to the sea with ships - these saw the works of Jehovah, and His marvels in the deep' are used; for those who know those cognitions and teachings drawn from the Word see those works and marvels. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The second angel sounded, and so to speak a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. And a third part of the sea became blood, with the result that a third part of creatures 
died who had their being<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> in the sea. And a third part of the ships was destroyed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A great mountain burning with fire' stands for self-love, <a href="1691.htm">1691</a>; 'the sea stands for the natural 
where factual knowledge resides, <a href="28.htm">28</a>; 'blood' stands for violence done to charity, <a href="374.htm">374</a>, <a href="1005.htm">1005</a>; 'the creatures who had their being in the sea' stands for truths contained in factual knowledge, together 
with forms of good; 'a third part' stands for something not yet complete, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a> (end). They 'died' stands for the fact that they had no spiritual life, <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, and therefore 'a third part of the ships was 
destroyed' stands for the fact that the truths and forms of good presented in teachings drawn from the Word were falsified. From all this one may see what is meant by this prophetic description.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
But in the contrary sense 'ships' means cognitions and teachings that present falsity and evil, as in Daniel,  </p>
<blockquote>
At the time of the end the king of the south will clash with him; therefore the 
king of the north will rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter into countries, and will overflow and penetrate. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2011:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 11:40</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The king 
of the south' stands for truths that spring from good, 'the king of the north' for falsities that spring from evil, 'chariots with horsemen and with ships' for teachings that present falsity. 'Countries' 
stands for Churches, which - it is foretold - falsities springing from evils will overflow and penetrate 'at the time of the end'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Every shipmaster, and everyone on board ships, 
and sailors, and all who trade on the sea, stood at a distance and were crying out as they saw the smoke of Babylon's burning, saying, What [city] is like the great city? Woe, woe, the great city, 
in which all who have ships on the sea have been made rich by her wealth.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it may be seen that 'ships' are cognitions and teachings that present falsity and evil because 'Babylon' 
describes worship which to outward appearance is holy but inwardly is profane. Once again no one can fail to see that 'ships' means something other than ships. The same is so in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Thus 
says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, For your sake I have sent to Babel, so that I may break down all the bars, and the Chaldeans in whose ships there is shouting <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In addition 
to these places falsities springing from evil are also meant by 'ships' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%202:16;%2023:1,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 2:16; 23:1, 14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2048:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 48:7</a>.

<p>`mons magnus igne ardens' pro amore sui, n. 1691; `mare' pro naturali ubi scientifica {5}, n. 28; `sanguis' pro violentia illata charitati, n. 374, 1005; `creaturae 
in mari habentes animas' pro veris scientificis cum bonis; `tertia pars' pro aliquid {6} nondum completum, n. 2788 fin.; quod `mortua sint' pro quod non illis vita spiritualis, n. 6119; inde `tertia 
pars navium corrupta' pro quod vera et bona doctrinalium ex Verbo {7}falsificata sint; ex his sciri potest quid significatur per hoc propheticum.  [5] Naves autem in opposito sensu significant cognitiones 
et doctrinalia falsi et mali; ut apud Danielem, In tempore finis collidetur cum eo rex meridiei, ideo quasi procella irruet in eum rex septentrionis cum curru, et cum equitibus, et cum navibus 
multis, et veniet in terras, et inundabit et penetrabit, xi 40; </p>
<p>`rex meridiei' pro veris ex bono, `rex septentrionis' pro falsis ex malo, `currus cum equitibus et cum navibus' pro doctrinalibus falsi; 
`terrae' pro Ecclesiis, quas quod `inundatura et penetratura' falsa ex malis in tempore finis, (x)praedicitur: [6] apud Johannem, Omnis gubernator, et omnis qui super navibus versatur, et  nautae, 
et omnes qui in mari negotiantur, e longinquo steterunt, et clamabant, videntes fumum combustionis Babylonis, dicentes, Quae similis urbi magnae:... vae, vae, urbs magna, in qua divites facti sunt 
omnes, qui habent naves in mari, ex pretiositate ejus, Apoc. xviii 17-19; </p>
<p>quod hic `naves' sint cognitiones et doctrinalia falsi et mali, {8} constare potest, quoniam `Babylon' est cultus qui exterius 
apparet sanctus, et interius est profanus; quod etiam per `naves' aliud quam naves {9}ibi intelligatur, nemo non videre potest: apud Esaiam, Sic dicit Jehovah Redemptor (x)vester, Sanctus Israelis; 
 Propter vos misi Babelem, ut dejiciam vectes omnes, et Chaldaeos, quorum in navibus clamor, xliii 14; </p>
<p>similiter.  Praeterea etiam falsa ex malo per `naves' significantur apud Esaiam ii (x)16; xxiii 
1, 14; Ps. xlviii 8 [A.V. 7]. @1 i sed quod alia per illas significentur$ @2 i ac eaedem$ @3 cum$ @4 est ex$ @5 i in communi$ @6 i et$ @7 falsificata before vera$ @8 i negotiator, gubernator 
et nautae, quod sint qui illa habent et ferunt$ @9 hic$ </p>
