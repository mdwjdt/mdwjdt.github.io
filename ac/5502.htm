<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5502节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5502.</strong>“彼此战战兢兢”表他们都共有的恐惧。这从“战战兢兢”和“彼此”的含义清楚可知：“战战兢兢”是指恐惧；“彼此”（a man to his brother）是指所有人共有，如刚才所述（<a href="5498.htm">5498</a>节）。害怕之所以用两种表述，即“他们心都快跳出来了”和他们“战战兢兢”来表达，是因为一种表述与意愿有关，另一种与理解力有关。事实上，这在圣言，尤其先知书部分是很常见的，因为两次描述的是同一个事物，只是换了个词而已。凡不知道此中秘密的人可能会以为这是一个毫无意义的重复；然而，事实并非如此，因为一种表述与良善有关，另一种与真理有关；由于良善属于意愿，真理属于理解力，所以一种表述与意愿有关，另一种表述与理解力有关。原因是，在圣言中，一切事物都是神圣的，这种神圣来自天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻。正因如此，天堂就存在于圣言里面，因而也是主；主是天堂全部中的全部，并且存在得如此充分、完全，以致主就是圣言。主的两个名字，即“耶稣基督”涉及同一事物，“耶稣”这个名涉及神性良善，“基督”这个名涉及神性真理（参看<a href="3004.htm">3004</a>，<a href="3005.htm">3005</a>，<a href="3008.htm">3008</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>节）。由此也明显可知，主存在于圣言的每一部分或一切事物中，并存在得如此充分、完全，以致祂就是圣言本身。良善与真理的婚姻，也就是天上的婚姻就在于圣言的每个细节中（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="5138.htm">5138</a>节）。由此可以得出进一步的结论：人若希望上天堂，就必须不仅拥有系信之真理的真理，而且还拥有系仁之良善的良善在自己里面。否则，他里面不会有天堂。</p>

And they trembled a man to his brother. That this signifies a general terror, is evident from the signification of "trembling," as being terror; and from the signification of "a man to his brother," 
as being what is general (as just above, n. 5498). The reason why fear is here expressed twice, by the "heart going forth," and by their "trembling," is that one expression has reference to the will, 
and the other to the understanding; for it is usual in the Word, especially the prophetic, to express one thing twice, merely changing the words. He who does not know the mystery herein might suppose 
that it is a meaningless repetition; yet this is not so, for one expression refers to good, and the other to truth; and because good is of the will and truth is of the understanding, one refers to the 
will and the other to the understanding. The reason is that in the Word everything is holy, and the holiness is from the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth. Hence it is that heaven is 
in the Word, and consequently the Lord, who is the all in all things of heaven, insomuch that the Lord is the Word. The double name of the Lord, "Jesus Christ," involves the same; the name "Jesus" expressing 
the Divine good, and the name "Christ" the Divine truth (see n. 3004, 3005, 3008, 3009). Hence it is plain also that the Lord is in all things of the Word, insomuch that He is the Word itself. 
(That a marriage of good and truth, or the heavenly marriage, is in every part of the Word, may be seen above, n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 5138.) From this it may also be plainly concluded that man, 
if he hopes for heaven, must be not only in the truth which is of faith but also in the good which is of charity, and that otherwise there is no heaven in him. </p>

'And they trembled [turning] a man to his brother' means the dread shared by them all. This is clear from the meaning of 'trembling' as dread, and from the meaning of 'a man to his brother' as shared 
by all, as just above in <a href="5498.htm">5498</a>. The reason why fear is expressed by these two phrases, by 'their heart went out' and 'they trembled', is that one has reference to the will and the other to the understanding. 
For it is quite usual in the Word, especially in the prophetical part, for the same matter to be described twice, though with a change of words. Anyone unacquainted with the hidden reason for 
this may imagine that it is pointless repetition; but that is not the case. One expression has reference to good, the other to truth; and because good belongs in the will and truth in the understanding, 
one has reference at the same time to the will and the other to the understanding. The reason for this is that in the Word everything is holy, and this holiness comes from the heavenly marriage, which 
is the marriage of goodness and truth. This being so, heaven is present within the Word, and so too is the Lord, the All in all of heaven - present so fully that He is the Word. The Lord's two names 
Jesus Christ entail the same, the name Jesus entailing Divine Good and the name Christ Divine Truth, see <a href="3004.htm">3004</a>, <a href="3005.htm">3005</a>, <a href="3008.htm">3008</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>. From this it is also evident that the Lord is present in every part 
of the Word, present so fully that He is the Word itself. Regarding the marriage of goodness and truth, which is the heavenly marriage, in every detail of the Word, see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="5138.htm">5138</a>. 
From this a further conclusion may be reached, that to live in expectation of heaven a person must have within him not only truth that is the truth of faith but also good that is the good of charity. 
Otherwise no heaven is present within him. </p>

`Et intremuerunt vir ad fratrem {1} suum': quod significet terrorem communem, constat ex significatione `intremiscere' quod sit terror; et ex significatione `vir ad fratrem' quod sit communis, ut mox 
supra n. 5498.  Quod timor hic his exprimatur, nempe per `exivit cor' et `intremuerunt', est quia unum se refert ad voluntatem et alterum ad intellectum; sollemne enim est in Verbo, imprimis prophetico, 
unam rem bis exprimere, solum mutatis vocibus; qui non novit mysterium quod inibi, autumare potest quod sit repetitio inanis, sed usque non ita est; una expressio se refert ad bonum, altera ad verum, 
et quia bonum est voluntatis et verum est intellectus, simul una se refert ad voluntatem, altera ad intellectum; causa est quia in Verbo omne sanctum est, et sanctum est ex conjugio caelesti quod 
est boni et veri; inde est quod caelum sit in Verbo, consequenter Dominus Qui est Omne in omnibus caeli, adeo ut Dominus sit Verbum; bina nomina Domini, nempe Jesus Christus, idem involvunt, `nomen Jesus' 
Divinum Bonum, et `nomen christus' Divinum Verum, videatur n. 3004, 3005, 3008, 3009; inde etiam patet quod Dominus sit in omnibus Verbi, adeo ut sit ipsum Verbum; quod conjugium boni et veri, seu 
conjugium caeleste, sit in singulis Verbi, videatur n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 5138.  Inde quoque evidenter concludi potest quod homo, si exspectat caelum, non solum erit in vero quod fidei sed 
etiam in bono quod charitatis, et quod alioquin nullum caelum sit in illo. @1 see p. 176, ft. 7$ </p>
