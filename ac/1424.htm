<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1424节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1424.</strong>“土地上的万宗族都要因你得福”表从主接受一切真理和良善。这从本节和前一节所论述的“赐福”的含义明显可知，也从“土地上的万宗族”表示一切良善与真理明显可知。事实上，在圣言中，“宗族”的含义与民族、人民的类似，因为它指向这二者；并且经上也说“民族的宗族”和“人民的宗族”。“民族”表良善，如前所述；“人民”表真理，这也在前面说过（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>节）；因此，“宗族”既表良善，也表真理（<a href="1261.htm">1261</a>节）。这些人之所以被称为“土地上的万宗族”，是因为一切善与真都属于爱之信，这信构成教会。“土地”表教会，因而表构成教会的信，如前所述（<a href="566.htm">566</a>节）。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1424.</strong> And in you all the clans of the ground will be blessed means that everything good and true comes from the Lord. This can be seen from the symbolism of blessing, treated of in this verse and the last [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420" target=_top>1420</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422" target=_top>1422</a>], and from the symbolism of the clans of the ground as everything good and true.<br />In the Word, the symbolism of clans is like that of nations and also of peoples, since the Word refers to both nations and peoples as clans and speaks of "clans of the nations" and "clans of the peoples" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_16_28" target=_top>1 Chronicles 16:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/bible_king-james-version_psalms_22_27" target=_top>Psalms 22:27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/bible_king-james-version_psalms_96_7" target=_top>96:7</a>]. Nations symbolize goodness, as shown, and peoples symbolize truth, as also shown (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1259" target=_top>1259</a>). So clans symbolize both goodness and truth (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1261" target=_top>1261</a>).<br />The reason they are called clans of the ground is that everything good and true is part of a loving faith, which is a feature of the church. The symbolism of the ground as the church and therefore as faith within the church has already been shown, at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1424/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1424</b></p><p><b>1424.</b>
And in thee shall all the families of the ground be blessed. That this signifies that all goods and truths are from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "to bless," which is treated of in this 
verse and the preceding; also from the signification of "the families of the ground," as being all good and truth; for in the Word "families" signify the like as do "nations" and "peoples," being 
predicated of both; and it is said, "families of the nations," and "families of the peoples." "Nations," as has been shown, signify goods; and "peoples," as has also been shown, signify truths (n. 1259); 
and therefore "families" signify goods and also truths (n. 1261). The reason why these are called "all the families of the ground," is that all goods and truths are of the faith of love, which is 
of the church. That by "the ground" is signified the church, consequently the faith of the church, was shown above (n. 566). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1424</b></p><p><b>1424.</b>
'And in you will all the families of the ground be blessed' means that all goods and truths are received from the Lord. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'blessing' dealt with in this verse and 
the previous verse, and also from the meaning of 'families of the ground' as all forms of good and truth. Indeed in the Word 'families' is similar in meaning to nations, and also to peoples, for 'families' 
is used in the Word in reference both to nations and to peoples, the expressions 'families of nations' and 'families of peoples' being used to describe them. 'Nations', as has been shown, means 
goods, while 'peoples', as has also been shown, means truths, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>; hence 'families' means both goods and truths, <a href="1261.htm">1261</a>. The reason they are called 'all the families of the ground' is that all goods and 
truths are a product of faith grounded in love, which faith constitutes the Church. That 'the ground' means the Church, and therefore the faith which constitutes the Church, has been shown already in <a href="566.htm">566</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1424</b>
</p><b>1424.</b>
'Et benedicentur in te omnes familiae humi':  quod significet quod omnia bona et vera a Domino, constare potest a significatione 'benedicere,' de qua in hoc versu et in praecedente, tum a significatione 
'familiarum humi' quod sint omnia bona et vera:  'familiae' enim in Verbo simile significant ac gentes ut et populi, praedicantur enim familiae in Verbo tam de gentibus quam de populis, et dicuntur 
familiae gentium et familiae populorum; 'gentes,' ut ostensum, significant bona, et 'populi,' ut quoque ostensum, significant vera, n. 1259, quare 'familiae' tam bona quam vera, n. 1261.  Quod dicantur 
'omnes familiae humi' est quia omnia bona et vera sunt fidei amoris quae est Ecclesiae; quod per 'humum' significetur Ecclesia, proinde fides quae Ecclesiae, ostensum est prius n. 566. </p>
