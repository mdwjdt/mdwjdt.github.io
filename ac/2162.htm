<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2162节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2162.</strong>“你们洗洗脚”表他们要披上某种属世之物，以便在那时祂所处的状态下，其直觉可以得到改善。这从“脚”的含义和一系列事物清楚可知，“脚”是指属世之物。此处所隐含的奥秘从以下事实在某种程度上变得明显，即：亚伯拉罕请求这三人容他取点水来，洗洗他们的脚，在树下歇息歇息，即便他知道那就是主或耶和华；还可从这一事实看出来，即若非如此，这类细节不会被提及。<br />“脚”表属世之物。这从来世的代表，因而从存在于上古之人当中并因此出现在圣言中的衍生代表清楚可知。属天和属灵之物由头及其所属之物来代表；理性及其所属之物由胸及其所属之物来代表；属世之物及其所属之物由脚及其所属之物来代表。正因如此，脚底和脚跟表最低级的属世之物（对此，参看<a href="259.htm">259</a>节）；而“鞋”表最最低级之物，它们是不洁净的（对此，参看<a href="1748.htm">1748</a>节）。<br />在先知书中，梦境和异象中的代表表示同样的事物。如尼布甲尼撒所看到的雕像，其头是精金的，胸和臂是银的，腹和股是铜的，腿是铁的，脚是半铁半泥的（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.32.htm">2:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.33.htm">33</a>）。这里的“头”表至内在的属天之物，是“精金的”（如前所示<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）；“胸”和“臂”表属灵之物或理性，它们是“银的”（如前所示<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）；但“脚”表较为低级的事物，它们是属世的，其真理用“铁”来表示，其良善用“泥”来表示。“铁”表真理，这可见于前文（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="426.htm">426</a>节）；“泥”表良善（<a href="1300.htm">1300</a>节），现在这种情况下，二者都是属世的。这就是主在天上的国度和地上的教会，以及成为主国度的每个人里面的相继次序。<br />但以理所看到的异象也一样，对此，经上说：<br />举目观看，见有一人身穿细麻衣，腰束乌法精金带。他身体如水苍玉，面貌如闪电，眼目如火把，手臂和脚像擦亮的铜那么闪耀。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这些话尤表关于良善与真理的圣言内在。“手臂和脚”是其构成字义的外在，因为属世之物在其中，圣言的外在事物就取自属世之物。至于每个部位，即腰、身体、面貌、眼目，以及人的许多其它部位分别表示什么，这从来世的代表明显可知。对此，蒙主怜悯，详情等到我们论述大人，就是主的天堂，以及灵人界的衍生代表时再予以说明。<br />关于摩西、亚伦、拿答、亚比户和七十位长老，我们读到：“他们看见以色列的神，他脚下仿佛有平铺的蓝宝石，如同天色明净”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.9.htm">24:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.10.htm">10</a>），这句经文表示，他们只看见以属世之物来代表的教会外在，以及圣言的字义。在字义中，外在事物同样由属世之物来代表，如前所述，这些外在事物就是下面“仿佛有平铺的蓝宝石，如同天色明净”的“脚”。显然，他们所看见的正是主，不过，仅仅看到那些较为低级或属世之物，因为祂被称为“以色列的神”，教会所代表的一切事物，以及圣言内义所表示的一切事物都代表祂。主照着那时所表示的事物而呈于眼见，如在启示录，当主代表圣言时，祂表现为骑在一匹白马上的一个人，如经上所清楚说明的（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>）。<br />以西结所看到的活物，就是基路伯，它们的脸面、翅膀和其它事物用来描述属天和属灵之物。至于属世之物，则描述如下：<br />他们的脚是直立的脚，脚掌好像牛犊之蹄，都像磨光了的铜般发亮。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.7.htm">1:7</a>）<br />脚（即属世之物）被说成“像磨光了的铜般发亮”，是因为“铜”表属世良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。主向约翰显为“人子”的形像几乎也一样：祂的眼目如同火焰，祂的脚好像锻炼光明的铜（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">1:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.18.htm">2:18</a>）。<br />“脚”表属世之物，这从以下经文进一步明显看出来：<br />我又看见另有一位大力的天使，从天降下，披着云彩，头上有虹。脸面像日头，两脚像火柱。他手里拿着小书卷，是展开的。他右脚踏海，左脚踏地。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.2.htm">2</a>）<br />这里的天使同样表圣言。圣言内在意义的性质以“头上有虹。脸面像日头”来表示，而外在意义，即字义则以“两脚”来表示。“海”表属世真理，“地”表属世良善，由此清楚可知“他右脚踏海，左脚踏地”表示什么。<br />“脚凳”在圣言各处都有所提及，但它的内义不为人知。如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华如此说，诸天是我的宝座，地是我的脚凳。你们要为我造何等的殿宇？哪里是我安息的地方呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.1.htm">66:1</a>）<br />“诸天”表属天和属灵之物，因而表主在天上的国度，以及地上的国度，即教会的至内在之物。“诸天”也表存在于成为主国度的每个人里面的至内在之物；因此，“诸天”就本身而言，也表属天和属灵之物，也就是爱与仁，及衍生之信的事物，因而表属内在敬拜的一切事物，同样表属圣言内义的一切事物；这些事物就是“诸天”，被称作主的“宝座”。而“地”则表与这些相对应的较为低级的一切事物，如相对低级的理性和属世之物，属天和属灵之物通过对应被论及。诸如存在于较低天堂、教会、外在敬拜，以及圣言字义中的事物，总之，就是诸如从内在事物发出并存在于外在事物中的所有这类事物因是属世之物，故被称作“地”和主的“脚凳”（关于“天与地”的内义，参看<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>节；关于“新天与新地”的含义，参看<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>节，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>节末尾；关于人是一个微型天堂，参看<a href="911.htm">911</a>，<a href="978.htm">978</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>节）。<br />同样，在耶利米哀歌：<br />主何竟发怒，使黑云遮蔽锡安城？祂将以色列的华美从天扔在地上；在祂发怒的日子并不记念自己的脚凳。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.1.htm">2:1</a>）<br />以及在诗篇：<br />你们当尊崇耶和华我们的神，在祂脚凳前下拜；祂本为圣！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗99.5.htm">99:5</a>）<br /><br />我们要进祂的帐棚，在祂脚凳前下拜。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.7.htm">132:7</a>）<br />在代表性教会（因而在犹太人当中），人们以为神的殿宇是指祂的脚凳，因为他们不知道神的殿宇表示外在的代表性敬拜；完全不知道“天”或“神的宝座”所表示的教会内在是什么。<br /><br />耶和华对我主说，你坐在我的右边，等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.1.htm">110:1</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.42.htm">22:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.45.htm">45</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.36.htm">12:36</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.42.htm">20:42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.43.htm">43</a>）<br />此处“脚凳”同样表属世之物，既表感官之物，也表记忆知识之物，以及由这些所形成的人的理性概念。当这些事物败坏敬拜，并且通过圣言字义来败坏，以致敬拜唯独在于外在事物，没有丝毫内在敬拜存在，确切地说，只有污秽的内在敬拜（对此，参看<a href="1094.htm">1094</a>，<a href="1175.htm">1175</a>，<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>节）时，它们就被称为“仇敌”。当这些被如此败坏和玷污时，它们就被称为“仇敌”。不过，由于就其本身而言，它们与内在敬拜有关，所以当这一切恢复时，它们，无论属外在敬拜之物，还是属圣言字义之物，就变成前面所说的“脚凳”。<br />在以赛亚书：<br />黎巴嫩的荣耀，就是松树、杉树、黄杨树，都必一同归你，使我圣所之地荣美，我也要使我脚踏之处得荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.13.htm">60:13</a>）<br />这论及主的国度和教会，其属天-属灵之物就是“黎巴嫩的荣耀”（即香柏树），其属天-属世之物就是“松树、杉树、黄杨树”（在圣言其它地方也一样）、因而是属外在敬拜之物。对此，经上说：“我也要使我脚踏之处得荣耀”；这一切得荣耀不可能是因为松树、杉树和黄杨树，而是因为它们所表示的事物。<br />“脚”表这些事物，这一点也可从犹太教会的代表明显看出来，如亚伦和他的儿子进会幕前要洗手洗脚（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.19.htm">30:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.31.htm">40:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.32.htm">32</a>）。没有人能明白这种行为所代表的奥秘，因为若内在不洁净，洗手洗脚岂不是根本不起任何作用的外在行为吗？内在也不可能因这样的洗濯得以洁净。但由于该教会的一切仪式都表示属天和属灵的内在事物，故此处的情形也是这样，也就是说，它表示外在敬拜的洁净，当有内在敬拜在其中时，它就洁净了。这解释了为何他们的洗濯盆是用铜造的，以及设在所罗门殿周围的大盆，就是所谓的铜海，连同那十个小一点的盆也是用铜造的（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.23.htm">7:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.38.htm">38</a>）。它们用铜来造，是因为“铜”代表存在于外在敬拜中的良善，这良善与属世良善一样（关于铜的这种含义，参看<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。<br />亚伦的后裔中凡折脚折手的都不可近前来向耶和华献火祭（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.19.htm">21:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.21.htm">21</a>），这同样是一种代表。“折脚折手”代表那些败坏外在敬拜的人。<br />“脚”表属世之物，这也可从先知书的各处明显看出来，如摩西五经中的这些预言：<br />愿亚设蒙祝福、胜过众子，愿他为兄弟所悦纳，可以把脚蘸在油中。你的鞋是铁的是铜的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.24.htm">33:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.25.htm">25</a>）<br />没有人理解这些话，除非他知道油、脚、铁、铜和鞋的内义是什么。“脚”是指属世之物，“鞋”是指诸如与肉体感官相关的更为低级的属世之物（对此，参看<a href="1748.htm">1748</a>节）；“油”是指属天之物（<a href="886.htm">886</a>节），“铁”是指属世真理（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="426.htm">426</a>节），“铜”是指属世良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。由此明显可知这些话象征什么。<br />在那鸿书：<br />耶和华的道路在狂风暴雨中，云彩为祂脚下的尘土。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿1.3.htm">1:3</a>）<br />此处“脚下的尘土”表人所具有的属世和肉体之物，它们产生云彩。诗篇中的这些话也有相同的含义：<br />耶和华使天下垂，亲自降临，有黑云在祂脚下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.9.htm">18:9</a>）<br />当信的良善与真理被属世之光败坏后，如人们所称谓的那样，它在圣言中被描述为搅浑诸水、践踏食物的“人脚兽蹄”。如以西结书：<br />你冲出江河，用爪搅动诸水，踹浑了江河。我必从埃及多水旁除灭所有的走兽，人脚兽蹄必不再搅浑它们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.2.htm">32:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处论述的是埃及，它表示记忆知识，如前所示（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；因此，搅浑诸水的“人脚兽蹄”表示源于感官和属世之物的记忆知识，人们由此推理信之奥秘；他们若非通过这类知识理解这些奥秘，便不相信；这等于根本不信，因为这种人越是推理，就越不信（参看<a href="128.htm">128</a>-<a href="130.htm">130</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="232.htm">232</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>，<a href="1072.htm">1072</a>，<a href="1385.htm">1385</a>节）。从所引用的上述经文明显可知，在圣言中，“脚”表属世之物；但从一系列事物明显可知“脚”进一步的含义。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2162</b></p><p><b>2162.</b>
Wash ye your feet. That this signifies that [the Divine] should put on something natural, in order that, in the state in which the Lord then was, He might the better perceive, may be seen from the signification 
of "feet," as being natural things, and also likewise from the series of things. That arcana here lie hidden may to some extent be seen from the fact that Abraham prayed the three men to take 
a little water and wash their feet, and to recline under a tree; when yet he knew that it was the Lord or Jehovah; and also from the fact that otherwise such things would not have been mentioned. [2] 
That "feet" signify natural things, is evident from the representatives in the other life, and from the derivative representatives among the most ancient people, and thus in the Word. Celestial and 
spiritual things are represented by the head and its belongings; rational things and their belongings, by the breast and its belongings; natural things and their belongings, by the feet and their belongings. 
Hence it is that the "sole" and the "heel" of the foot signify the lowest natural things (concerning which see n. 259); and a "shoe" the lowest things of all, which are unclean (concerning 
which see n. 1748). [3] Similar things are signified by the representations in the dreams and visions in the Prophets-as by the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar,      The head of which was good gold, the 
breast and arms of silver, the belly and thighs of brass, the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay (Dan. 2:32-33), where the "head" signifies celestial things, which are inmost, and 
are "gold" (as shown, n. 113, 1551, 1552); the "breast and arms" spiritual or rational things, which are "silver" (as shown, n. 1551); but the "feet" are the lower things, which are natural, the truths 
of which are signified by "iron," and the goods by "clay" [argillum seu lutum]. That "iron" denotes truth, may be seen above (n. 425, 426); also that "clay" denotes good (n. 1300); in the present 
case both being natural. Such is the order of succession in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and in the church which is the Lord's kingdom on earth, and also in everyone who is a kingdom of the Lord. [4] 
The case is similar with the vision that Daniel saw, of which it is said: </p>
<p>     I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; 
his body also was like the beryl [tarshish], and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like the brightness of burnished brass (Dan. 10:5-6). Specifically, 
by these words are signified the interiors of the Word as to goods and truths; the "arms" and "feet" are its exteriors, which are the sense of the letter, because natural things are therein, 
for the exterior things of the Word are taken from natural things. What each part signifies besides, namely, the loins, body, face, eyes, and the many other things of man, is evident from the representatives 
in the other life, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said when we come to treat of the Grand Man, which is the Lord's heaven, and of the derivative representatives 
in the world of spirits. [5] That which we read concerning Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders-that "they saw the God of Israel, under whose feet there was as it were a work of sapphire 
stone, and as it were the substance of heaven as to purity" (Exod. 24:9, 10)-signifies that they saw only the externals of the church represented in natural things; and also the literal sense of 
the Word, in which likewise external things are represented by natural things-as before said-which are the "feet under which was as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as it were the substance of heaven." 
That it was the Lord who was seen by them, but only in those lower or natural things, is evident, for He is called "the God of Israel," whom all things of the church represented, and all things 
of the Word in the internal sense signified. For the Lord is presented to view in accordance with the things which are at the time signified-in John, as a Man upon a white horse, when He signified the 
Word, as is plainly said (Rev. 19:11, 13). [6] The animals seen by Ezekiel, which were cherubs, are described as to celestial and spiritual things-among other representatives-by their faces and wings, 
but as to natural things, as follows: </p>
<p>     Their feet, a straight foot; and the sole of their feet as the sole of a calf's foot; and they glittered like the brightness of burnished brass (Ezek. 1:7). The 
feet (that is, the natural things) are said to have "glittered like burnished brass," for the reason that "brass" signifies natural good (n. 425, 1551). It was much the same with the Lord's 
appearance to John as the "Son of man:"      Whose eyes were as a flame of fire, and His feet like unto burnished brass (Rev. 1:14-15; 2:18). [7] That the "feet" signify natural things, may be further 
evident from the passages that now follow. In John: </p>
<p>     I saw a strong angel coming down out of heaven, encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow about his head, and his face as the sun, and his feet 
as pillars of fire; and he had in his hand a little book open; and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth (Rev. 10:1-2). By this angel there is in like manner signified the 
Word; the quality of which in the internal sense is signified by the "rainbow about his head," and by "his face being as the sun;" but the external sense, or that of the letter, by the "feet." The "sea" 
denotes natural truths, the "earth" natural goods, which shows what is signified by his putting "his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth." [8] A "footstool" is mentioned in various 
passages of the Word; but it is not known what it signifies in the internal sense. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said, The heavens are My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Where is that house which 
ye will build unto Me? and where is that place of My rest? (Isa. 66:1). The "heavens" are the celestial and spiritual things (thus the inmost things) of both the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and 
of the Lord's kingdom on the earth, that is, in the church, and also in every man who is a kingdom of the Lord or a church; thus they also denote celestial and spiritual things as regarded in themselves, 
which are those of love and charity and of the derivative faith; and thus are all things which are of internal worship, and in like manner all things which are of the internal sense of the Word: 
these are the "heavens," and are called the Lord's "throne." But the "earth" is all lower things that correspond to these-as the lower rational and natural things, whereof also things celestial and 
spiritual are predicated from correspondence; such as are the things which are in the lower heavens, also those in the church and in external worship, and in the literal sense of the Word; in short, all 
such things as proceed from things internal and are presented in things external-these, being natural things, are called the "earth" and the Lord's "footstool." (What "heaven and earth" denote in the 
internal sense, may be seen above, n. 82, 1733; also what the "new heaven and the new earth" denote, n. 2117, 2118 end; and that man is a little heaven, n. 911, 978, 1900.) [9] In like manner in Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    The Lord covereth the daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger; He hath cast down from the heavens unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and hath not remembered His footstool in the day 
of His anger (Lam. 2:1). Also in David: </p>
<p>     Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and bow yourselves down at His footstool, Holy is He (Ps. 99:5). And again: </p>
<p>     We will enter into His tabernacles, we will 
bow down at His footstool (Ps. 132:7). In the Representative Church-thus among the Jews-it was supposed that the house of God and the temple were His footstool, for they knew not that external representative 
worship was signified by the house of God and the temple; and what the internals of the church were (which were signified by "heaven," or God's "throne"), they were utterly ignorant of. [10] 
Again: </p>
<p>The saying of Jehovah unto my Lord: Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool (Ps. 110:1; Matt. 22:42-45; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42, 43). Here in like manner a "footstool" 
signifies natural things, both those which are sensuous, and those of memory-knowledge, and the derivative rational things of man, which are called "enemies" when they pervert worship, and do this 
from the literal sense of the Word, so that there is worship solely in externals, and either no internal worship, or else that which is filthy (see n. 1094, 1175, 1182). When things natural and rational 
are thus perverted and defiled, they are called "enemies;" but because, regarded in themselves, they have reference to internal worship-when this is restored, they become as before said a "footstool," 
whether they are things of external worship, or of the literal sense of the Word. [11] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir-tree, the pine, and the box together, to beautify 
the place of My sanctuary, and I will make the place of My feet honorable (Isa. 60:13), where the subject is the Lord's kingdom and church, the celestial-spiritual things of which are the "glory 
of Lebanon" (that is, the cedars), and its celestial natural things are the "fir-tree, the pine, and the box" (as also in the Word elsewhere), and thus the things which are of external worship; of 
which it is said, "I will make the place of My feet honorable;" and this cannot be made honorable by the fir, the pine, and the box, but by the things which they signify. [12] That the "feet" signify 
these things, is evident also from the representatives in the Jewish Church-as from Aaron and his sons washing their hands and their feet before entering into the tabernacle (Exod. 30:19-20; 40:31, 
32). No one can fail to see that arcana were thus represented, for what is the washing of the hands and feet but an external affair which is of no avail unless the internal is clean and pure? Nor can 
the internal be cleaned and purified by such a washing. But as all the rites of that church were significative of internal things, which are celestial and spiritual, such is the case here also: it is 
cleanness of external worship that is here signified, and external worship is clean when there is internal worship within it. Hence their lavers were of brass, and also that great laver that was called 
the brazen sea, and the ten smaller lavers of brass around the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 7:23, 38); because "brass" represented the good of external worship, which is the same as natural good (concerning 
which signification of "brass," see n. 425, 1551). [13] In like manner it was a representative that,      A man of the seed of Aaron in whom there was a fracture of the foot or a fracture of 
the hand, should not approach to offer the offering made by fire to Jehovah (Lev. 21:19, 21). By those who had a "fracture" in the feet or hands were represented such as are in perverted external worship. [14] 
That "feet" signify natural things, is further evident in other passages that occur in the Prophets, as in these propheticals in Moses: </p>
<p>     Blessed be Asher above sons; let him be accepted 
of his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil; the iron and brass of thy shoe (Deut. 33:24, 25). No one can understand these words unless it is known what "oil," the "foot," "iron," "brass," and 
a "shoe" signify in the internal sense. That "foot" is the natural, and "shoe" the still lower natural, such as is the corporeal sensual, may be seen above (n. 1748); also that "oil" is the celestial 
(n. 886), "iron" natural truth (n. 425, 426), and "brass" natural good (n. 425, 1551), which shows what these words involve. [15] In Nahum: </p>
<p>     The way of Jehovah is in the storm and tempest, and 
the clouds are the dust of His feet (Nahum 1:3), where the "dust of the feet" signifies the natural and corporeal things with man, whence come the "clouds." The same also is signified by these words 
in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah bowed the heavens, and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet (Ps. 18:9). [16] When the goods and truths of faith are perverted by means of natural light, as it is 
called, this is described in the Word by the "feet" and "hoofs" of a beast, whereby waters are disturbed, and food is trampled upon. As in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou hast come forth into the rivers, and hast 
troubled the waters with thy feet; and trampled the streams thereof. I will destroy every beast thereof from off many waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more, nor the hoof of beast 
(Ezek. 32:2, 13). Egypt is here treated of, by which are signified memory-knowledges [scientiae] (as has been shown, n. 1164, 1165, 1462); so that by the "feet" and "hoofs" by which the streams and 
waters are troubled are signified memory-knowledges [scientifica] derived from sensuous and natural things, from which they reason about the arcana of faith; nor do they believe until these arcana are 
comprehended by means of such knowledges; and this is not to believe at all, for the more such persons reason, the less do they believe (see n. 128-130, 215, 232, 233, 1072, 1385). From all this it 
is now evident that by "feet" in the Word are signified natural things; but what more is signified, is evident from the series of things. </p>

'Wash your feet' means that they were to take on something natural so that during the state He was then passing through His perception might be improved. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'feet' 
as natural things, and also in a like manner from the train of thought. That arcana lie concealed here becomes clear to a certain extent from the fact that Abraham besought the three men to take a little 
water and wash their feet, and to relax under a tree, even though he knew that it was the Lord or Jehovah; also from the fact that if it was not so such details would not have been mentioned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
That 'feet' means natural things becomes clear from the representatives in the next life, and consequently from representatives derived from these that existed among the most ancient people and so 
occur in the Word. Celestial and spiritual things are represented by 'the head' and the parts of the head; by 'the breast' and the parts of the breast are represented rational concepts and aspects of 
these; by 'the feet and the parts of the feet are represented natural things and the different kinds of these. Consequently 'the sole' and 'the heel' of the foot mean the lowest natural things, regarding 
which see <a href="259.htm">259</a>, while 'a shoe' means the lowest things of all, which are filthy, regarding which see <a href="1748.htm">1748</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Similar things are meant by the representations in the dreams and visions in the Prophets, 
such as the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar, the head of which was fine gold, the breast and arms were silver, the belly and thighs were bronze, the legs were iron, and the feet were partly iron 
and partly clay, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:-32,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:-32, 33</a>. In this case 'the head' means celestial things, which are inmost and are 'gold', as shown in <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>; 'the breast and arms' spiritual or rational things, which 
are 'silver', as shown in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>; but 'the feet' means lower things, which are natural, the truths of which are meant by 'iron' and the goods by 'clay' or mud. As regards 'iron' meaning truth, see <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>, and 'clay' good, <a href="1300.htm">1300</a>, both of which in the present case are natural. These things come in the same order in the Lord's kingdom in heaven, and in the Church which is the Lord's kingdom on earth, 
and also in every individual who is a kingdom of the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is similar with the vision which Daniel himself saw, of which the following is said, </p>
<blockquote>
I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, 
a man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz and whose body was like tarshish,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and whose face was like the appearance of lightning, and whose eyes were like fiery torches, and whose 
arms and feet like the shine of burnished bronze. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2010:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 10: 5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically these words mean the interiors of the Word as to goods and truths. 'The arms and feet' are its interiors, which constitute 
the sense of the letter, for natural things occur there, since natural things are the source from which the exteriors of the Word are drawn. What further is meant by each of these parts, namely 
the loins, body, face, eyes, and many others in man, becomes clear from the representatives in the next life, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of when the Grand Man - which is the Lord's 
heaven - and the representatives that originate in heaven but occur in the world of spirits are dealt with. </p>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 That which one reads about Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders seeing 
the God of Israel, under whose feet there was so to speak a paved work of sapphire stone, like the substance of the sky for pureness, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24: 9, 10</a>, means that they saw, represented in natural things, 
merely the external features of the Church, and also the literal sense of the Word, in which too, as has been stated, external things are represented by natural things. And these external things 
are 'the feet' under which there is so to speak 'a paved work of sapphire stone, like the substance of the sky itself'. It is clear that it was the Lord whom they saw, though only in those lower or 
natural things, since He is called 'the God of Israel', whom all things of the Church represented and whom all things of the Word in the internal sense meant. For the Lord is presented visually in accordance 
with the things that are meant at the time. When, for example, in John, He was seen as a Man on a white horse, the Word was in this case meant by Him, as is explicitly stated in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:%2011,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19: 11, 13</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
The living creatures seen by Ezekiel, which were cherubs, are described as regards celestial and spiritual things by their faces and wings, and also many other things. But as regards natural 
things they are described as follows, by their feet, a straight foot, and the soles of their feet being like the sole of a calf's foot, and sparkling like the shine of burnished bronze, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1: 7</a>. The 
reason their feet, that is, natural things, are said to have sparkled like burnished bronze is that 'bronze' means natural good, dealt with in <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. It was similar when the Lord appeared to John 
as the Son of Man: His eyes were like a flame of fire and His feet were like burnished bronze, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:%2014,%2015;%202:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1: 14, 15; 2: 18</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 That 'feet' means natural things is further evident from the following places: 
In John, who saw, </p>
<blockquote>
A mighty angel coming down out of heaven, wrapped in a cloud, and a rainbow around his head, his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire. In his hand he had 
a little book opened, and he set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2010:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 10: 1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This angel in a similar way means the Word. The nature of the Word in the internal sense is meant 
by 'the rainbow around his head' and by 'his face being like the sun'; but the external sense, or sense of the letter, is meant by his 'feet'. 'The sea' is natural truths, 'the land' natural goods, 
from which it is clear what is meant by his setting his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Reference is made in various places in the Word to 'a footstool', but no one knows what is 
meant by this in the internal sense; as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said, The heavens are My throne and the earth My footstool. Where is this house which you are going to build for Me and where is this place 
of My rest? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66: 1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The heavens' means the celestial and spiritual things, and so the inmost things, both of the Lord's kingdom in heaven and of the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the Church. 
Also meant by 'the heavens' are those same things as they exist with every individual who is a kingdom of the Lord or a Church. Thus 'the heavens' also means the celestial and spiritual things 
regarded in themselves which are matters of love and charity and of faith that springs from these, and so means all things that belong to internal worship and similarly all things that belong to the internal 
sense of the Word. These things are meant by 'the heavens' and are called 'the Lord's throne', but by 'the earth' are meant all lower things corresponding to those meant by 'the heavens'. By 'the 
earth' lower rational and natural things are meant, which from correspondence are likewise referred to as celestial and spiritual things, such as those that exist in the lower heavens and also in 
the Church, and those things which belong to external worship and also those present in the literal sense of the Word. In short, all things that stem from internal things and manifest themselves in external 
are, being natural things, called 'the earth' and 'the Lord's footstool'. What heaven and earth mean in the internal sense of the Word, see also <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>. What the new heaven and new earth mean, 
see <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end). And that man is a miniature heaven, see <a href="911.htm">911</a>, <a href="978.htm">978</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Similarly in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
In His anger the Lord covers the daughter of Zion with a cloud, He has cast down from 
heaven to earth the splendour of Israel, and has not remembered His footstool on the day of His anger. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2: 1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Exalt Jehovah our God, and bow down at His footstool. Holy is He! 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2099:%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 99: 5</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>People in the representative Church - and thus the Jews - imagined 
that God's house and the temple were His footstool. They did not know that by the Lord's house and the temple was meant external representative worship. What the internal features of the Church were, 
meant by 'heaven' or God's throne, they had no knowledge at all. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand till I make your enemies a stool for your feet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20110:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 110: 1</a>;

</blockquote>
<p>Here 'footstool' in a similar way means natural things - both sensory impressions and factual knowledge, and man's rational ideas formed from these - which 
are called 'enemies' when worship is perverted by them (which is done from the literal sense of the Word). As a result worship exists solely in things that are external, and no internal worship - 
or rather only internal worship that is defiled - exists, concerning which see <a href="1094.htm">1094</a>, <a href="1175.htm">1175</a>, <a href="1182.htm">1182</a>. When these have became perverted and defiled in this manner they are called 'enemies'; but because, regarded 
in themselves, they have reference to internal worship, when this is restored, they become - both the things that belong to external worship and those that belong to the sense of the letter of 
the Word - 'a footstool', as stated already. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the fir, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will 
make the place of My feet glorious. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom and Church, the celestial-spiritual things of which are meant by 'the glory of Lebanon', that is, cedar trees, but 
the celestial-natural things of it by 'the fir, the pine, and the box', as also in other places in the Word. Thus it is the external aspects of worship that are referred to when it is said that 'I 
will make the place of My feet glorious'; and this cannot he made glorious by the fir, the pine, and the box, but by the things meant by these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 That 'feet' means these things is also clear from 
the representatives in the Jewish Church, for example, by the requirement that Aaron and his sons were to wash their hands and feet before entering the tabernacle, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2030:%2019,%2020;%2040:%2031,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 30: 19, 20; 40: 31, 32</a>. No one 
is able to see that arcana were represented by this, for what is such washing of the hands and feet but some external act which does not do anything at all if the internal is not pure and clean? Nor 
can the internal be made pure and clean by such a washing. But because all the forms of ritual of that Church meant internal things that are celestial and spiritual, so it was with this form; that is 
to say, it meant the cleanliness of external worship, which is clean when internal worship is present within it. This explains why their lavers were made of bronze, and also the large laver which was 
called 'the bronze sea', together with the ten smaller ones made of bronze around Solomon's temple, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 7: <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>. They were made of bronze because 'bronze' represented good present in external 
worship, which is the same as natural good. Regarding this meaning of bronze, see <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
 Similarly representative was the prohibition that no man among Aaron's descendants who had a broken 
foot or a broken hand should draw near to offer fire-offerings to Jehovah, Lev. 21: <a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a>. 'Broken feet and hands' represented those people whose external worship was perverted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 That 'feet' 
means natural things is also evident from various other places in the Prophets, as in these prophetical utterances in Moses, </p>
<p>Blessed above sons be Asher; let him be acceptable among his brothers, and 
dipping his foot in oil. Your shoes will be iron and bronze. Deut. 33: <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>. </p>
<p>These words will not be understood by anybody unless he knows what the meaning of oil, foot, iron, bronze, and shoe 
are in the internal sense. 'Foot' is the natural; 'shoe' the still lower natural, such as that which is connected with the senses and the body, see <a href="1748.htm">1748</a>; 'oil' is the celestial, <a href="886.htm">886</a>; 'iron' natural truth, 
<a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>; and 'bronze' natural good, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. From these places it is evident what these words embody. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[15]</b>
 In Nahum, </p>
<p>The way of Jehovah is in storm and tempest, and the clouds are the dust 
of His feet. Nahum 1: <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the dust of the feet' means the natural and bodily things with man which give rise to clouds. The same is also meant by these words in David, </p>
<p>Jehovah bowed the 
heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet. Ps. 18: <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[16]</b>
 When goods and truths of faith are perverted by natural light, as people call it, it is described in the Word as the feet 
and hoofs of a beast which trouble waters and trample on food, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>You have come forth into the rivers, and have troubled the waters with your feet and trampled their rivers. I will 
destroy all its beasts from over many waters, and the foot of man will not trouble them any longer, nor will the hoofs of beast. Ezek. 32: <a href="2.htm">2</a>, <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to Egypt, which meant forms of knowledge, 
as shown in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. Thus by 'feet and hoofs which trouble the rivers and water' are meant facts gained from sensory and from natural things, on the basis of which people reason about the 
arcana of faith and do not believe anything until they grasp it by this method. This amounts to not believing at all, for the more such people go on reasoning, the less believing they are; see what is 
said in <a href="128.htm">128</a>-<a href="130.htm">130</a>, <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="232.htm">232</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="1072.htm">1072</a>, <a href="1385.htm">1385</a>. From all these quotations it is now evident that 'feet' in the Word means natural things. But what further meaning 'feet' may have is evident from the context 
in which the expression occurs.

<p>quod pedes dicantur `micuisse instar aeris levigati,' hoc est, naturalia, est 
quia `aes' significat bonum naturale, de quo n. 425, 1551.  Similiter quod apparuit Johanni, 	Ut Filius hominis,... cujus oculi essent sicut flamma ignis, et pedes similes chalcolibano, Apoc. i 14, 
15; ii 18. Quod `pedes' significent naturalia, porro patet a sequentibus; [7] apud Johannem, 	Vidit {13} angelum fortem descendentem e caelo, circumdatum nube, et iris circum caput, et facies illius 
sicut sol, et pedes illius sicut columnae ignis; habentem in manu sua libellum apertum, et ponentem pedem suum dextrum super mare, sinistrum super terram, Apoc. x 1, 2; </p>
<p>per quem angelum similiter 
significatur Verbum: quale est in interno sensu, per `iridem circum caput, et per faciem sicut sol'; at sensus externus seu litterae, per `pedes'; `mare' sunt naturalia vera, `terra' naturalia bona; inde 
constat quid significat quod `posuerit pedem dextrum super mare, et sinistrum super terram.' [8] Memoratur passim in Verbo `scabellum pedum,' sed ignoratur quid in sensu interno significat; ut apud 
Esaiam, 	Dixit Jehovah, Caeli thronus Meus, et terra scabellum pedum Meorum; ubi illa domus, quam aedificabitis Mihi, et ubi ille locus quietis Meae? lxvi 1; </p>
<p>`caeli' sunt caelestia et spiritualia, 
ita intima, tam regni Domini in caelis, quam regni Domini in terris {14}, seu in Ecclesia, tum apud unumquemvis hominem qui est regnum Domini seu Ecclesia; ita {15} etiam caelestia et spiritualia in 
se spectata quae sunt amoris et charitatis et inde fidei, ita omnia quae sunt cultus interni, similiter omnia quae sunt sensus interni Verbi, haec sunt `caeli,' et vocantur `thronus Domini': `terra' autem 
sunt inferiora omnia illis correspondentia, ut sunt inferiora rationalia et naturalia, de quibus ex correspondentia etiam caelestia et spiritualia praedicantur, qualia sunt illa quae in caelis inferioribus, 
tum quae in Ecclesia, quaeque in cultu externo, tum quae in sensu litterali Verbi; verbo omnia quae procedunt ab internis et sistuntur in externis, haec quia naturalia, vocantur `terra', et 
`scabellum pedum Domini'; (m)quid caelum et terra in sensu interno [Verbi,] videatur etiam n. 82, 1733: {16} quid novum caelum et nova terra, n. 2117, 2118 fin.'; et quod homo sit exiguum caelum, n. 
911, 978, 1900: [9] similiter apud Jeremiam, 	Obnubilat in ira Sua Dominus filiam Zionis, projicere fecit e caelis in terram decorem Israelis, et, non recordatus scabelli pedum Suorum in die irae Suae, 
Thren. ii 1: </p>
<p>tum etiam {17} apud Davidem, 	Exaltate Jehovam Deum nostrum, et incurvate vos scabello pedum Ipsius, sanctus Ille, Ps. xcix 5: </p>
<p>alibi apud eundem, 	Intrabimus in habitacula Ipsius, 
incurvabimus nos scabello pedum Ipsius, Ps. cxxxii 7; </p>
<p>putarunt in Ecclesia repraesentativa, ita Judaei, quod domus Dei et templum esset scabellum pedum nescientes quod per `domum Dei et templum' significatus 
sit {18} cultus repraesentativus externus; quid interna Ecclesiae quae significabantur {19} per `caelum,' (o)seu thronum Dei, prorsus ignorabant: [10] apud eundem, 	Dictum Jehovae Domino meo, 
Sede ad dextram Meam, usque dum posuero inimicos tuos scabellum pedibus tuis, Ps. cx 1; Matth. xxii 42 [A.V. 44]; Marc. xii 36; Luc. xx 42, 43; </p>
<p>per `scabellum pedum' hic similiter significantur naturalia, 
tam sensualia quam scientifica, et inde rationalia hominis, quae `inimici' dicuntur quando pervertunt cultum, et hoc ex sensu litterali Verbi; sic ut sit cultus solum in externis, et nullus seu 
foedus internus, de quo n. 1094, 1175, 1182 {20}; cum ita perversa sunt et foedata, vocantur `inimici'; at quia in se spectata se referunt ad cultum internum, qui cum restituitur, fiunt, ut prius dictum, 
tam illa quae sunt cultus externi quam quae sunt sensus litterae Verbi, `scabellum pedum': [11] apud Esaiam, 	Gloria Libani ad te veniet; abies, taeda, buxus simul, ad decorandum locum sanctuarii 
Mei, et locum pedum Meorum honorabilem reddam, lx 13; </p>
<p>ibi agitur de regno Domini et Ecclesia, cujus caelestia spiritualia sunt `gloria Libani seu cedri,' caelestia autem naturalia sunt `abies, taeda, 
buxus,' sicut etiam alibi in Verbo; ita quae externa cultus sunt, de quibus dicitur quod `locum pedum Meorum honorabilem reddam,' qui non honorabilis fieri potest per abietem, taedam, buxum, sed 
per illa quae significant; [12] quod `pedes' illa significent, constat quoque ex repraesentativis in Ecclesia Judaica, ut per quod 	Lavarent Aharon et filii ejus manus et pedes, antequam intrarent in 
tabernaculum {21}, Exod. xxx 19, 20; xl 31, 32; </p>
<p>quae quod repraesentaverint arcana, nullus non videre potest, nam quid lavatio manuum et pedum nisi externum quid, quod nihil facit nisi internum sit 
mundum et purum? (m)Nec internum per lavationem illam mundari et purificari potest; sed quia omnes ritus istius Ecclesiae significabant interna quae sunt caelestia et spiritualia, ita hic quoque, nempe 
munditiem {22} externi cultus, qui tunc mundus est quando in externo internus est {23}; inde lavacra eorum fuerunt ex aere, ut quoque magnum {24} illud quod `mare aeneum' dictum, cum decem labris minoribus 
ex aere, circa templum Salomonis, 1 Reg. vii 23, 38; quia `aes" repraesentabat bonam externi cultus, quod idem est ac bonum naturale, de qua `aeris' significatione videatur n. 425, 1551.  [13] 
Similiter repraesentativam fuit quod 	Vir, in quo esset fractura pedis aut fractura manus,... e semine Aharonis, non accederet ad offerendum ignita Jehovae, Lev. xxi 19, 21; </p>
<p>per `fractos pedibus (o)et 
manibus repraesentabantur illi qui in cultu perverso externo sunt; [14] quod `pedes' significent naturalia, patet etiam alibi passim apud Prophetas, ut (o)prophetica haec apud Mosen,        Benedictus 
prae filiis Asher, sit acceptus fratrum suorum, et intingens in oleam pedem suum, ferrum et aes calcei tui, Deut. xxxiii 24, 25; </p>
<p>haec nulli intellecta erant nisi sciatur quid in sensu interno significant 
oleum, pes, ferrum, aes, calceus; quod `pes' sit naturale, `calceus' adhuc inferius naturale, quale (o)est sensuale corporeum, videatur {25} n. 1748; et quod `oleum' sit caeleste, n. 886; `ferrum' 
verum naturale, n. 425, 426; et `aes' bonum naturale, n. 425, 1551, inde patet quid involvunt: [15] apud Nahum, 	Jehovae in procella et tempestate via, et nubes pulvis pedum Ipsius, 1 3; </p>
<p>ubi 
`pulvis pedum' significat naturalia et corporea quae apud hominem, ex quibus nubes. Idem etiam apud Davidem significatur per haec, 	Jehovah inclinavit caelos, atque descendit, et caligo sub pedibus 
Ipsius, Ps. xviii 10 [A.V. 9]. [16] Quando bona et vera fidei per naturale lumen, ut vocant, pervertuntur, in Verbo describitur per pedes, et ungulas {26} bestiae, quibus turbantur aquae, et quibus cibi 
proculcantur, ut apud Ezechielem, 	Prodiisti in flumina, et turbasti quas pedibus tuis, et proculcavit flumina earum;... perdam omnem bestiam ejus desuper aquis multis, et non conturbabit eas pes 
hominis amplius, nec ungula bestiae, xxxii 2, 13; </p>
<p>agitur hic de Aegypto per quam quod significatae sint scientiae, ostensum est n. 1164, 1165, 1462; ita per `pedes et ungulas, quibus turbantur flumina 
et aquae,' scientifica ex sensualibus et ex naturalibus, ex quibus ratiocinantur de arcanis fidei, nec prius quam per illa capiuntur, credunt, quod est nusquam credere, nam quo magis ratiocinantur 
tales, eo minus credunt; videantur quae n. 128-130, 215, 232, 233, 1072, 1385.  Ex his omnibus nunc patet quod per `pedes' in Verbo significentur naturalia; sed quid significatur amplius, ex serie rerum 
patet. 	@1 i itaque.$ 	@2 quae infra illa sunt, ut sunt rationalia, et quae rationalium, per pectus, et quae pectoris sunt; quae autem adhuc inferiora sunt, ut sunt naturalia, per pedes, et quae
