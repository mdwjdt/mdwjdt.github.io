<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7153节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7153.</strong>“砖却要如数交纳”表将要大量引入的虚假。这从前面所述（<a href="7116.htm">7116</a>节），那里有相同的话。这些就是这几节在内义上所包含的事，这些事在人看来似乎无足轻重，而且也不连贯。然而，其中每一件事对所论述的主题来说，都是必不可少的，并且以最优美的方式连贯起来。天使则发觉这一切都是真的，因为他们在天堂之光中看见事件的系列和关联，连同内层真理所形成的无数秘密，这赋予这些事以最优美、最怡人的表象。人根本不可能做到这一点，因为内层真理向他隐藏。所以他也无法将它们连贯起来；在他看来，它们似乎是不连贯的，这就是为何如刚才所说的，它们对他来说似乎无足轻重。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7153</b></p><p><b>7153.</b>
And the tale of bricks ye shall give. That this signifies the falsities which were to be injected in abundance, is evident from what was said above (n. 7116), where are the like      words. These then 
are the things contained in these verses in the internal sense, and which to men may perhaps appear as of but little moment, and also disconnected; nevertheless they are each of them essential to the 
subject treated of, and cohere most beautifully. That this is so is perceived by the angels, for they see the series and connection of things in the light of heaven, together with countless secret things 
that are shaped from interior truths, giving rise to a form that is most beautiful and pleasing; which cannot possibly be done by man, because interior truths have been hidden from him, and consequently 
he cannot connect them together; but they appear to him disconnected, and therefore, as just said, of little moment. </p>

'And you shall deliver the tally of bricks' means the falsities which are to be introduced in abundance. This is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="7116.htm">7116</a>, where similar words occur. Such then are 
the [arcana] which these verses contain in the internal sense, things which perhaps seem to man to be of little importance and also unconnected with one another. Nevertheless each one is essential to 
the subject that is being dealt with; and all hang together in a very beautiful way. Angels perceive this to be true, for they see in the light of heaven the ways in which things follow one another 
and are linked together, and they see countless arcana formed out of interior truths, which gives those things a very beautiful and very lovely appearance. Man cannot do the same thing at all because 
interior truths are hidden from him. Nor therefore can he connect together the details contained in these verses; it seems to him as though they are disjointed, which is why, as has been stated, they 
seem to him to be of little importance. </p>

`Et demensum laterum dabitis': quod significet falsa quae copia injicienda, constat ex illis quae supra n. 7116 dicta sunt, ubi similia.  Haec nunc sunt quae in his versibus in sensu interno continentur, 
quae coram homine apparent forte sicut parvi momenti, {1}et quoque sicut sparsa; sed usque singula sunt essentialia rei de qua agitur, et pulcherrime cohaerentia; quod ita sit, percipiunt angeli, 
nam illi vident rerum series et nexus in luce caeli, cum innumerabilibus arcanis {2}conformatis ex interioribus veris, inde forma rerum pulcherrima et amoenissima; quod nequicquam ab homine fieri potest, 
quia interiora vera illi abscondita sunt, inde nec connectere {3}illa potest, sed ei apparet ut sparsum, et inde, ut dictum, sicut parvi momenti. 	@1 ut et$ 	@2 et implet illa$ 	@3 aliquid$ </p>
