<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1434节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1434．“他兄弟的儿子罗得”表通过感官学到的真理，因而表童年时被植入在主里面的最初之物。这从“罗得”、“儿子”、“兄弟”的含义清楚可知：前一节提到，“罗得”表感官知觉；“儿子”表真理，如前所述（<a href="264.htm">264</a>，<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>），“兄弟”表信之真理（<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。因此，此处指的是通过感官学到的真理，因为就内义而言，不能考虑这些人或这些话，而要考虑他们所具有的含义。在天堂，他们不知道罗得是谁，只知道他所代表的特质；他们也不知道儿子是什么，只知道相对来说就象儿子那样的属灵状态；他们同样不知道兄弟是什么，除非通过诸如天堂所存在的那种兄弟情谊来理解。至于通过感官学到的真理，它是将自身植入进去的最初真理；因为童年时的判断力还不能高过感官。通过感官学到的真理就在于看到神所创造的一切地上和世俗之物，在于看到每一个事物都具有一个目的，在于看到每一个事物中都有神国的某种形像。这种真理唯独被植入在属天之人里面，由于唯独主是属天之人，所以通过感官所获得的这些及类似真理在童年早期就被植入在祂里面。主以这种方式预备接受属天事物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1434.</strong> The symbolism of and Lot his brother's son as truth gained through the senses, that is, as the first kind of truth instilled in the Lord as a youth, can be seen from the following: Lot symbolizes the senses, as mentioned in the last verse. A son symbolizes truth, as described earlier, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1434/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264" target=_top>264</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1434/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489" target=_top>489</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1434/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_491" target=_top>491</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1434/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_533" target=_top>533</a>. And a brother is also religious truth, 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1434/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>.{*1} So Lot here is truth gained through the senses.<br />The inner sense implies nothing about the people or the words involved; it concerns itself only with their symbolism. In heaven, they do not know who Lot is but what quality he represents. They do not know what a son is but what a spiritual condition resembling that of a son is. And they do not know what a brother is except from the kind of brotherhood that exists in heaven.<br />[2] To turn to the subject of truth gained through the senses, it is the first kind of truth that instills itself, because our powers of judgment reach no deeper in youth. Sensory truth is the vision of all earthly and worldly things as the creation of God; of each and every object as having a purpose; and of each and every object as displaying an image of God's kingdom. This sensory truth is infused only in heavenly people, and since only the Lord was a heavenly person, these sensory truths and others like them filtered in early in his youth. This prepared him for receiving heavenly truth.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the reference here to a brother as meaning religious truth, see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1434/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007" target=_top>1007</a>.

And Lot his brother's son. That this signifies sensuous truth, and thus the first that was insinuated into the Lord when a child, is evident from the signification of "Lot," as being the sensuous-as 
stated in the explication of the preceding verse-and from the signification of "son," as being truth (see n. 264, 489, 491, 533); and also from the signification of "brother," as being the truth of faith 
(n. 367). Thus sensuous truth is what is here signified, for in the internal sense there is no reflection on the persons and words, but only upon their signification. In heaven they do not know who 
Lot is, but only the quality that is represented by him; nor do they know what a son is, but the spiritual state by which one is relatively as a son; nor do they know what a brother is, except from 
brotherhood such as there is in heaven. As regards sensuous truth, it is the first truth that insinuates itself; for in childhood the judgment does not go higher. Sensuous truth consists in seeing all 
earthly and worldly things as being created by God, and each and every thing for a purpose, and in all things whatsoever a certain image of God's kingdom. This sensuous truth is insinuated solely with 
the celestial man; and as the Lord alone was a celestial man, these and similar sensuous truths were insinuated into Him in earliest childhood: whereby He was prepared for the reception of celestial things. </p>

'And Lot his brother's son' means truth that has been learned through the senses, thus the first that was implanted in the Lord in childhood. This is clear from the meaning of 'Lot', dealt with in the 
previous verse, as sensory perception, and from the meaning of 'son' as truth, dealt with already in <a href="264.htm">264</a>, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>; and also from the meaning of 'brother' too as the truth of faith, <a href="367.htm">367</a>. Thus it 
is truth learned through the senses that is meant here, for in the internal sense no attention is paid to the representative persons or expressions, only to the meanings which these carry within them. 
In heaven they do not know who 'Lot' is, only the characteristic represented by him. Nor do they know what 'son' is, only the spiritual state which relatively is like a son. Nor do they know what 'brother' 
is except from the kind of brotherhood that exists in heaven. As regards truth learned through the senses, it is the first truth to implant itself, for in childhood the power of judgement does 
not go any higher than the senses. Truth learned through the senses consists in seeing all earthly and worldly things as having been created by God, in seeing every single thing as having a purpose, 
and in seeing in every single one some likeness of the kingdom of God. Such truth is implanted in none but the celestial man, and since the Lord alone was a celestial man, these and similar truths acquired 
through the senses were implanted in Him in earliest childhood. In this way He was made ready to receive celestial things. </p>

'Et {1}Lotum filium fratris sui':  quod significet verum sensuale, ita primum quod insinuatum Domino cum puer, constat ex significatione 'Loti,' de qua in vers. praec., quod sit sensuale, exque significatione 
'filii' quod sit verum, de qua prius n. 264, 489, 491, 533, tum ex significatione 'fratris' quod etiam sit verum fidei, n. 367; ita quod hic sit verum sensuale; nam in sensu interno nihil reflectitur 
super personas et voces, modo super significationem earum: in caelo non sciunt quis Lot, sed qualitatem repraesentatam per eum; nec sciunt quid filius, sed statum spiritualem, quo respective 
est sicut filius; nec sciunt quid frater, nisi ex fraternitate qualis est in caelo. Quod verum sensuale attinet, est primum verum quod se insinuat, nam altius non vadit judicium in pueritia; verum sensuale 
est, quod videat omnia terrestria et mundana ut creata a Deo, et omnia et singula ad finem, et in omnibus et singulis aliquod instar regni Dei; hoc verum sensuale non insinuatur nisi apud hominem 
caelestem; et quia Dominus solus fuit caelestis homo, haec et similia vera sensualia Ipsi insinuata sunt in prima pueritia, ita praeparatus ad recipienda caelestia. @1 I i per.$ </p>
