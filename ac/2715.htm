<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2715节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2715.</strong>此处有两个奥秘：第一，与属天之人的良善相比，属灵之人的良善相对模糊；第二，属灵之人所具有的模糊性被主的神圣人性照亮。关于第一个奥秘，即与属天之人的良善相比，属灵之人的良善相对模糊。这一点从前面有关属灵之人状态（与属天之人的状态相比）的论述（<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>节）明显看出来。通过这两种状态的对照，这种模糊的事实是显而易见的。对属天之人来说，良善本身被植入在其心智的意愿部分，并通过那里的光进入理解力部分。而对属灵之人来说，意愿部分整个被毁灭了，以致他们丝毫没有来自意愿的良善；因此主才将良善植入在其心智的理解力部分（参看<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="928.htm">928</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2124.htm">2124</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>节）。拥有生命的，主要是人心智的意愿部分，而理解力部分从意愿那里接受生命。由于对属灵之人而言，意愿部分被毁灭，以至于无非是恶，然而，邪恶却通过它持续不断地流入其理解力部分，即其思维中，故很明显，与属天之人的良善相比，那里的良善是模糊的。<br />正因如此，属灵之人不象属天之人那样拥有对主之爱，也没有存在于一切敬拜中的那种本质上的谦卑，而良善是通过谦卑从主流入的。因为傲慢的心根本不乐于接受，而谦卑的心会接受。属灵之人也不象属天之人那样拥有对邻之爱，因为我欲和物欲不断从其意愿部分流进来，并模糊了那爱之良善。人若深入思考，必能清楚看出这一点。如他可以反思一下，他向别人行善时，其动机是世俗的；因此，尽管不是有意识的，但他仍想着回报，要么从他所帮助的人那里得到回报，要么在来世从主那里得到回报；他的良善就这样被寻求功德的想法所玷污。他也可以反思一下，当他行善时，他若说与别人听，从而将自己置于其他人之上，就处于其生命的快乐了。但属天之人爱邻胜己，从不思想回报，也不以任何方式将自己置于其他人之上。<br />此外，属灵之人所具有的良善因出于各种假设的说服性信仰而变得模糊，而这些假设同样是由我欲和物欲产生的。至于他们在信的问题上的说服性信仰的性质，可参看前文（<a href="2682.htm">2682</a>，<a href="2689.htm">2689</a>节末尾）。这也是出于其心智意愿部分的邪恶流入的结果。<br />再者，与属天之人的良善相比，属灵之人的良善相对模糊。这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：即他不象属天之人那样通过直觉认识真理，而是通过父母、老师的教导，以及他生来所进入的教义认识真理。若他添加来自他自己及其想法的东西，那么，绝大部分感觉及其错谬、理性及其表象就会占主导地位，使得他几乎不能象属天之人那样承认纯粹的真理。尽管如此，主仍在这些看似纯正的真理中植入良善，哪怕这些真理是错谬，或是真理的表象。不过，这良善却因这类真理而变得模糊，因为它带有源于与之相联结的真理的某种特性。这种情形就像阳光落到物体上，接受这光的物体的性质使得在这些物体中所看到的光具有各种色彩。若接受形式的性质和它接受的方式是适合和相对应的，色彩就很美丽；但若接受形式的性质和它接受的方式是不适合，因而是不相对应的，色彩就很丑陋。同样，良善本身照着这真理而从它获得一种特性。<br />这个奥秘也可从以下事实明显看出来：即属灵之人不知道何为邪恶；他几乎不相信除了违反十诫的行为外，还有其它邪恶存在，也没有意识到存在于情感与思维中的无数邪恶。他没有反思它们，也不视其为恶。一切诸如伴随恶欲和快感之乐，他都视之为善；他既追求、赞同我欲的现实快乐，也为之辩解。殊不知，这类事物会影响他的灵，在来世，他会完全变成这个样子。<br />由此同样清楚可知，尽管整部圣言都在论述对主之爱和对邻之爱的良善，几乎没有论及其它事，但属灵之人仍不知道良善是信仰的本质，甚至不知道何为本质上的爱与仁。由此还清楚可知，尽管他知道某事，就是信（这信被他视为本身是本质的）的事务，但他仍讨论这事是否如此，除非他已通过大量生活经验得以确认。属天之人从不讨论这种事，因为他们知道并发觉事情的确如此。因此，主在马太福音中说：<br />你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是出于邪恶。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br />因为属天之人就处于属灵之人所争论的真理本身当中。属天之人因处于真理本身，故能通过它看见属于那真理的无数事物，从而通过光仿佛看到整个天堂。但属灵之人因争论事情是否如此，所以只要他们这样做，就无法抵达属天之人所具有的光之最远边界，更不用说通过他们的光看见任何事物了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2715</b></p><p><b>2715.</b>
There are two arcana here, one, that the good of the spiritual man is comparatively obscure; and the other, that this obscurity is illuminated by the Lord's Divine Human. As regards the first, that good 
with the spiritual man is comparatively obscure, this is evident from what was said above concerning the state of the spiritual man in comparison with the state of the celestial man (n. 2708); for 
by comparing these states the fact becomes manifest. With the celestial, good itself is implanted in their will part, and light comes therefrom into their intellectual part; but with the spiritual all 
the will part has been destroyed, so that they have nothing of good from it; and therefore good is implanted by the Lord in their intellectual part (see n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 
2124, 2256). The will part is what chiefly lives in man, while the intellectual lives from it. As therefore the will part has been so destroyed with the spiritual man as to be nothing but evil, and yet 
evil flows in from it perpetually and continually into his intellectual part, that is, into his thought, it is evident that the good there is comparatively obscured. [2] Hence it is that the spiritual 
have not love to the Lord, as have the celestial, and consequently they have not the humiliation which is essential in all worship, and by means of which good can flow in from the Lord; for an elated 
heart does not receive at all, but a humble heart. Neither have the spiritual love toward the neighbor, as the celestial have for the love of self and the world continually flows in from their will 
part, and obscures the good of that love; as must also be evident to everyone if he reflects, by considering that when he does good to anyone it is for the sake of an end in the world; and that therefore, 
although he is not doing so consciously, still he is thinking of a recompense, either from those to whom he does good, or from the Lord in the other life; thus that his good is defiled by the 
idea of merit, as also by considering that when he has done any good, if he can make it known and thus set himself above others, he is in the delight of his life. But the celestial love the neighbor more 
than themselves; nor do they think at all of recompense, nor in any manner set themselves up above others. [3] Moreover, the good that is with the spiritual has been obscured by persuasions from 
various principles arising also from the love of self and of the world. The quality of their persuasion even of faith may be seen above (n. 2682, 2689 at the end); this likewise is from the influx of 
evil from their will part. [4] Moreover that the good with the spiritual man is obscure in comparison, is evident from the fact that he does not know what is true from any perception, as the celestial 
do, but from instruction from parents and masters, and also from the doctrine into which he was born; and when he superadds anything from himself and from his thought, then for the most part the sensuous 
and its fallacies, and the rational and its appearances, prevail, and cause him to be scarcely able to acknowledge any pure truth, such as the celestial acknowledge. Nevertheless in those seeming 
truths the Lord implants good, even if the truths are fallacious, or appearances of truth; but the good becomes obscure from them, being qualified by the truths with which it is conjoined. The case 
with this is as with the light of the sun flowing into objects. The quality of the objects which receive it causes the light to appear there under the aspect of color, beautiful if the quality of the 
form and of the reception is becoming and correspondent, but unbeautiful if the quality of the form and of the reception is not becoming, and thus not correspondent. In this manner the good itself is 
qualified according to the truth. [5] The same is also manifest from the fact that the spiritual man does not know what evil is. He scarcely believes any other things to be evil than those which are 
contrary to the precepts of the Decalogue, and is not aware of the evils of affection and thought, which are innumerable; nor does he reflect upon them, nor call them evils. All delights whatever of cupidities 
and pleasures he regards no otherwise than as good; and the very delights of the love of self he both seeks after, and approves, and excuses, being ignorant that such things affect his spirit, 
and that he becomes altogether such in the other life. [6] From this it is in like manner evident that though scarcely anything else is treated of in the whole Word than the good of love to the Lord 
and of love toward the neighbor, still the spiritual man does not know that good is the essential of faith, nor even what love and charity are in their essence; and that as to what he has learned of 
faith, which he makes essential, he nevertheless discusses whether it be so, unless he has been confirmed by much experience of life. This the celestial never do, for they know and perceive that it 
is so. Hence it is said by the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; what is more than these is of evil (Matt. 5:37). For the celestial are in the truth itself respecting which 
the spiritual dispute whether it be so; hence, as the celestial are in the truth itself, they can see from it endless things which belong to that truth, and thus from light see as it were the whole 
heaven. But as the spiritual dispute whether it be so, they cannot, so long as they do this, come to the first boundary of the light of the celestial, still less look at anything from their light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2715</b></p><p><b>2715.</b>
Two arcana exist here, the first being that, compared with the good of the celestial man, that of the spiritual man is obscure, the second that this obscurity is brightened by light from the Lord's Divine 
Human. As regards the first of these - that the good residing with the spiritual man is obscure compared with the celestial man's - this may be seen from what has been stated above in <a href="2708.htm">2708</a> about 
the state of the spiritual man in comparison with that of the celestial man. From a comparison of the two states the fact of that obscurity is quite evident. With those who are celestial good itself 
exists implanted in the will part of their mind, and from there light enters the understanding part. But with those who are spiritual the whole of the will part is corrupted, so that they have no good 
at all from there, and therefore the Lord implants good in the understanding part of their mind, see <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="928.htm">928</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="2124.htm">2124</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a>. The will part is, in the main, the part of 
man's mind that possesses life, whereas the understanding part receives life from the will. Since therefore the will part in the case of the spiritual man is so corrupted as to be nothing but evil, and 
yet evil is flowing in from there unceasingly and constantly into the understanding part, that is, into his thought, it is clear that the good there is obscure compared with the celestial man's good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
As a consequence those who are spiritual do not have love to the Lord, as those who are celestial do; nor therefore does that humility exist with them which is essential in all worship and by 
means of which good can flow in from the Lord; for a heart that is haughty is not at all receptive, only one that is humble. Nor do those who are spiritual have love towards the neighbour, as those who 
are celestial do, because self-love and love of the world are constantly flowing in from the will part of their mind, bringing obscurity into the good that goes with that love towards the neighbour. 
This may also become clear to one who reflects from the fact that when he helps another he does so for worldly reasons; thus though he may not consciously have it in mind he is nevertheless thinking 
about what he will get in return either from those he helps or in the next life from the Lord, which being so his good is still defiled with merit-seeking. It may also become clear to him from the fact 
that when he has done anything good and is able to speak about it to others and so set himself up above others, he is in his element. But those who are celestial love the neighbour more than they love 
themselves, and do not ever think about repayment or in any way set themselves up above others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The good residing with those who are spiritual is in addition made obscure by persuasive beliefs 
that are the product of various assumptions, which likewise have their origin in self-love and love of the world. For the nature of their persuasive beliefs even in matters of faith, see <a href="2682.htm">2682</a>, <a href="2689.htm">2689</a> 
(end). This too is a product of the influx of evil from the will part of their mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It may in addition become clear that the good residing with the spiritual man is obscure compared with the 
celestial man's, from the fact that he does not know what truth is, as those who are celestial do, from any perception. Instead he knows what truth is from what he has learned from parents and teachers, 
and also from the doctrine into which he was born. And when he adds to this anything from himself and from his own thinking, it is for the most part the senses and the illusions of the senses, also 
the rational and the appearances present within the rational, that predominate, and these make it barely possible for him to acknowledge any pure truth like that acknowledged by those who are celestial. 
But in spite of this, within things that are seemingly true the Lord implants good, even though these truths are mere illusions or else appearances of truth. But this good is made obscure by such 
truths, for it derives its specific nature from the truths to which it is joined. It is like the light of the sun falling upon objects. The nature of the objects receiving the light causes the light 
to be seen within those objects in the form of colours, which are beautiful if the nature of the recipient form and the manner of its receiving are fitting and correspondent, hideous if the nature of 
the recipient form and the manner of its receiving are not fitting and so not correspondent. In the same way good itself acquires a specific nature from the truth [to which it is joined]. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The same 
arcanum is also evident from the fact that the spiritual man does not know what evil is. He scarcely believes that any other evils exist than actions contrary to the Ten Commandments. Of evils present 
in affection and thought, which are countless, he has no knowledge nor does he reflect on them or call them evils. All delights whatever that go with evil desires and pleasures he does not regard 
as other than good; and the actual delights that are part of self-love he both pursues, approves of, and excuses, without knowing that such things have an effect on his spirit and that he becomes altogether 
such in the next life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From this it is in a similar way clear that although the whole of the Word deals with scarcely any other matter than the good which goes with love to the Lord and 
love towards the neighbour, the spiritual man does not know that that good is the sum and substance of faith, nor even what the essential nature of love and charity is. It is also clear that though something 
which is a matter of faith may be known to him - faith being considered by him to be essential in itself - he nevertheless discusses whether it is true, unless he has been confirmed by much experience 
of life. Those who are celestial do not discuss the same because they know and have a perception that it is true hence the Lord's statement in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Let your words be, Yes, yes; No, no; 
anything beyond this is from evil.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:%2037&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5: 37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For those who are celestial are immersed in the truth itself about which those who are spiritual dispute. Consequently because those who are celestial 
are immersed in the truth itself, they are able to see from it numberless facets of that truth, and so from light to see so to speak heaven in its entirety. But those who are spiritual, because they 
dispute whether it is true, cannot - so long as they do so - arrive at the remotest boundary of the light existing with those who are celestial, let alone behold anything from their light.

Duo hic sunt arcana, unum, quod bonum spirituali hominis (t)sit obscurum respective: alterum, quod obscurum illud illuminetur a Divino Humano Domini.  Quod primum attinet, [nempe] quod bonum apud spiritualem 
hominem sit obscurum respective, constare potest ex illis quae de statu spiritualis hominis respective a statum caelestis hominis supra n. 2708 dicta sunt; a comparatione status utriusque id 
manifeste patet; apud caelestes est {1} ipsum bonum implantatum in parte eorum voluntaria, et inde lux venit in partem intellectualem eis; sed apud spirituales deperditum est omne voluntarium, sic ut 
illis nihil boni sit inde, et ideo a Domino bonum implantatur in parte eorum intellectuali, videatur n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2124, 2256; pars voluntaria est quae principaliter vivit 
apud hominem, intellectualis vero vivit inde; cum itaque voluntarium {1} apud spiritualem ita deperditum est {2} ut non sit nisi malum, et tamen jugiter et continue inde influit malum in partem intellectualem 
seu cogitationem ejus, constat quod bonum ibi sit obscuratum respective: [2] inde est quod spiritualibus non sit amor in Dominum, sicut est caelestibus {3}, proinde nec humiliatio quae essentialis 
{4} est in omni cultu, et per quam {5} influere potest bonum a Domino; cor enim elatum nusquam {6} recipit, sed cor humile.  Spiritualibus nec est amor erga proximum, sicut est caelestibus 
{3}, continue enim a parte eorum voluntaria influit amor sui et mundi, et obscurat bonam istius amoris; quod constare unicuique potest, si reflectit, etiam ex eo quod cum alicui benefacit, sit propter 
finem in mundo, ita tametsi non manifeste {7}, usque cogitat de remuneratione {8}, sive ab illis quibus benefacit, sive a Domino in altera vita; sic ut bonum ejus usque (t)sit conspurcatum meritorio; 
tum quoque ex eo quod cum aliquod bonum fecerit, si illud memorare possit, et sic se praeferre aliis, in suae vitae jucundo sit; caelestes vero amant proximum plus quam semet; nec usquam cogitant de 
retributione, neque se aliis praeferunt ullo modo. [3] Praeterea bonum apud spirituales obscuratum est persuasivis ex principiis variis, oriundis etiam ex amore sua et mundi; quale sit persuasivum etiam 
fidei, videatur n. 2682, 2689 ad fin.; hoc quoque ex influxu mali a parte eorum voluntaria. [4] Praeterea ex eo constare potest quod bonum apud spiritualem hominem sit obscurum respective, quia non 
ex aliqua perceptione, ut caelestes, novit quid verum, sed ex instructione a parentibus et magistris, tum ex doctrina in quam natus, et cum aliquid superaddit ex se et ex cogitatione, tunc ut plurimum 
sensuale et ejus fallaciae, ac rationale et ejus apparentiae, praevalent, et faciunt ut vix agnoscere possit aliquod verum purum, quale agnoscunt caelestes, usque tamen istis quasi veris implantat Dominus 
bonum, etiamsi fallacia vera sunt, aut apparentia veri, sed bonum fit inde obscurum, qualificatum a veris quibus conjungitur; se habet hoc sicut lux solis influens in objecta; qualitas objectorum 
quae recipiunt, facit ut appareat lux ibi sub specie coloris, pulchri si qualitas formae et receptionis sit decens et correspondens, impulchri si qualitas formae et receptionis sit non decens, nec 
ita correspondens; ita ipsum bonum qualificatur secundum verum.  [5] Etiam ex eo patet (m)quod spiritualis homo non sciat quid malum, vix alia credit mala quam quae contra praecepta decalogi sunt, mala 
autem affectionis et cogitationis quae innumerabilia, nescit, nec reflectit super ea, nec vocat mala; jucunda cupiditatum et voluptatum quaecumque non aliter spectat ac bona, ipsaque jucunda amoris 
sui et affectat, et approbat, et excusat, ignorans quod talia sint quae afficiunt spiritum ejus, et quod prorsus talis fiat in altera vita.  [6] Ex eo similiter constat, quod spiritualis homo tametsi 
in toto Verbo vix agatur nisi de bono amoris in Dominum et amoris erga Proximum, usque non sciat quod bonum sit essentiale fidei, ne quidem quid amor et charitas in sua essentia sit; et quod novit de 
fide quam essentialem facit, usque disserit num ita sit, nisi confirmatus per multum vitae, quod caelestes nusquam faciunt, norunt enim et percipiunt quod ita sit, inde a Domino dictum apud Matthaeum, 	Esto 
sermo vester ita ita, non, non, quod ultra haec est, ex malo est, v 37; </p>
<p>(o)sunt enim caelestes in ipso vero, de quo disputant spirituales num ita sit, inde caelestes quia in ipso vero, possunt 
inde videre indefinita quae istius veri sunt, ita ex luce quasi totum caelum; sed spirituales quia disputant num ita sit, non possunt tamdiu venire ad primum terminum lucis caelestium, minus ex eorum 
luce spectare aliquid.' 	@1 est after implantatum.$ 	@2 cumque voluntaria.$ 	@3 deperdita.$ 	@4 caelestium.$ 	@5 essentiale.$ 	@6 in qua.$ 	@7 i et superbum.$ 	@8 i ita.$ 	@9 i aliqua.$ </p>
