<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第736节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>736.</strong>至于挪亚，或这个新教会的成员，他的特点是，他简单地相信他从上古教会所得来的一切，也就是教义的条文。这些条文被那些叫做以诺的人汇集起来，并变成了一种教义形式。然而，名为挪亚之人的性情，完全不同于那些名为拿非利人（Nephilim）并灭亡的大洪水前之人的性情。因为后者将信之教义浸没于自己污秽的欲望中，以此孕育可怖的信念。他们不愿从这些可怖信念中退离，无论别人怎样教导他们，也无论如何向他们展示这些信念是虚假。这两种天赋或性情还存在于现代人当中，前者很容易重生，而后者却很难。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]736.</strong> To describe Noah, or in other words, the people of this new church, they were the kind who had an uncomplicated belief in the things they had received from the earliest church. These were the doctrinal tenets that the people called Enoch had collected and organized into a kind of systematic theology [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519" target=_top>519-521</a>].<br />Their character was entirely different from that of the pre-Flood people who died in the Flood and who were called Nephilim.{*1} These were the people who had merged the teachings of faith with their foul desires and so had seized on horrendous delusions that they would not back away from, no matter how hard others tried to teach them and to show them the falsity of their notions.<br />People with the same two types of mentality or personality exist today too. The former can regenerate easily, the latter only with difficulty.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the "Nephilim," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581" target=_top>581-583</a> and note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_554" target=_top>554</a>.

As regards "Noah" or the man of this new church, he was of such character that he believed in simplicity what he had from the Most Ancient Church, which were matters of doctrine, collected and reduced 
to some doctrinal form by those who were called "Enoch." And he was of an entirely different genius from the antediluvians who perished, called "Nephilim" who immersed the doctrinal things of faith 
in their foul cupidities, and thereby conceived direful persuasions, from which they would not recede, however much instructed by others and shown the falsity of those persuasions. There are at this day 
also men of the one genius, or nature, and men of the other. Those of the one may easily be regenerated, but those of the other with difficulty. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 736</b></p><p><b>736.</b>
As for Noah, or the member of this new Church, he was such that he believed with simplicity those things which he had come to possess from the Most Ancient Church. These were items of doctrine that had 
been gathered together and converted into a kind of doctrinal form by those called Enoch. The disposition of the people meant by Noah however was entirely different from those before the Flood who 
perished, called the Nephilim. For they immersed doctrinal matters concerning faith in their own filthy desires and in this way strove after dreadful persuasions from which they were unwilling to draw 
back even though they were taught by others and were shown that these were falsities. This dual genius or disposition also exists among people today. The former can be regenerated easily, but the latter 
with difficulty. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 736</b>
</p><b>736.</b>
Quod Noahum, seu hominem novae hujus Ecclesiae, concernit, is fuit talis quod simpliciter crediderit illis quae habuit ex Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae fuerunt doctrinalia collecta et redacta in quandam 
doctrinae formam ab illis (x)qui Hanochus dicti sunt: et prorsus diversae indolis fuit ab antediluvianis qui perierunt, et Nephilim dicti, qui doctrinalia fidei immerserunt foedis suis cupiditatibus, 
et sic captarunt diras persuasiones, a quibus recedere non vellent, utcumque ab aliis instruerentur et iis demonstraretur quod falsa: homines duplicis hujus genii seu indolis hodie quoque dantur; sed 
illi facile possunt regenerari, hi autem difficile. </p>
