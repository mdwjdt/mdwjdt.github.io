<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6068节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6068.</strong>“看哪，他们正在歌珊地”表它们在记忆知识所在的属世层的中间。这从“歌珊”的含义清楚可知，“歌珊”是指属世层的中间或至内在部分（参看<a href="5910.htm">5910</a>，<a href="6028.htm">6028</a>，<a href="6031.htm">6031</a>节）。至于它们在属世层的中间，情况是这样：一旦教会的良善与真理，也就是教会从主的圣言所接受的东西在属世层中得到承认，并以信仰被接受，它们就会占据那里的中间位置。因为那些直接被关注的事物在中间，而那些没有直接被关注的事物则在边缘。因此，那些在中间的事物看得很清楚，而那些在边缘的事物则看得很模糊。<br />其中的情形与眼睛的看见是一样的。眼睛直接看到的物体在中间，也就是在中心，看得很清楚；而眼睛没有直接看到的物体在边缘，远离中间，看得很模糊。因为内眼，也就是理性心智，从天堂之光获得自己的视觉；它观看在它自己之外的属世层中的那些事物，也就是记忆知识，犹如肉眼观看在它自己之外的物体或物体的整个领域。内在视觉指向给予最大快乐并接近内心的事物，它将自己的注意力直接集中在它们上面，就像外在视觉专注于它的物体领域中同样令人快乐的事物。因此，内在视觉专注于最与此人所在的真理并良善一致的记忆知识。那时，对此人来说，这些记忆知识就在中间。内在视觉观看记忆知识的原因是，它是属灵的，因而将其注意力指向属灵事物，从而指向记忆知识，因为这些是属灵视域的对象。</p>

And behold they are in the land of Goshen. That this signifies that they are in the midst of the natural where memory-knowledges are, is evident from the signification of "Goshen," as being the midst 
or inmost in the natural (see n. 5910, 6028, 6031). As regards being in the midst of the natural, the case is this. When the goods and truths which are of the church, that is, which are from the Word 
of the Lord, have been acknowledged, and are received in the natural with faith, they then occupy the middle place there. For those things which are directly under the view are in the midst, but those 
things which are not directly under the view are at the sides. Hence those things which are in the midst appear clearly, but those which are at the sides appear obscurely. The case herein is the same 
as it is with the sight of the eye. Those things which are directly under the sight are in the midst, that is, in the center, and appear clearly; but those which are not directly under the sight are 
remote from the midst, that is, are at the sides, and appear obscurely. For the internal eye, which is the intellectual mind, and which has its sight from the light of heaven, views those things which 
are in the natural outside of itself, which are memory-knowledges, just as the external eye views objects or a field of objects outside of itself. The internal sight is determined to those things which 
afford the greatest delight and which are dear to the heart, and upon them it fixes a direct view, as also does the external sight to like things in its fields of objects. Thus the internal sight 
is determined to the memory-knowledges which are most in accord with the truth and good in which the man is; and then, with him, these memory-knowledges are in the midst. The reason why the internal sight 
looks at memory-knowledges, is that it is spiritual, and therefore is determined to spiritual things, thus to memory-knowledges, for these fall under the spiritual view. </p>

'And behold, they are in the land of Goshen' means that they are in the middle of the natural where factual knowledge resides. This is clear from the meaning of 'Goshen' as the middle or inmost part 
of the natural, dealt with in <a href="5910.htm">5910</a>, <a href="6028.htm">6028</a>, <a href="6031.htm">6031</a>. What is meant by their being in the middle of the natural is this: Once the Church's forms of good and its truths - that is, those which it has received 
from the Lord's Word - have been acknowledged and with faith accepted in the natural, they occupy the middle there. For things that are immediate objects of attention are in the middle, and those that 
are not immediate objects of attention are to the sides; consequently the ones in the middle are seen clearly, those to the sides vaguely. </p>

 It is the same as it is with the sight of the eye. The 
objects on which the eye is directly focused are in the middle, that is, in the centre and are seen clearly; but those on which it is not directly focused are to the sides, away from the middle, and 
are seen vaguely. For the inner eye, which is the intellectual power of the mind and which depends for its vision on the light of heaven, sees things outside itself in the natural, which are known facts, 
just as the physical eye sees objects or a whole range of objects outside itself. Inward sight is directed towards the things that give the greatest delight and are close to the heart, and it fixes 
its attention directly on them, in the same way as outward sight focuses on things similarly delightful in whole ranges of objects. Inward sight accordingly focuses on those known facts that are in 
close agreement with the truth and good that govern a person. These facts are then, for that person, in the middle. The reason why inward sight sees factual knowledge is that such sight is spiritual 
and therefore directs its attention towards spiritual matters, thus towards known facts, for these are the appropriate objects of spiritual attention. </p>

`Et ecce illi in terra Goshen': quod significet quod in medio naturali ubi scientifica, constat ex significatione `Goshen' quod sit medium seu intimum in naturali, de qua n. 5910, 6028, 6031.  Cum hoc 
quod sit in medio naturali, ita se habet:  cum bona et vera quae Ecclesiae, hoc est, quae ex Verbo Domini, agnita sunt et fide recepta in naturali, tunc ea tenent medium ibi; nam quae directe sub intuitione 
sunt, in medio sunt, quae autem non directe sub intuitione sunt, ad latera sunt; [2]inde illa quae in medio, clare apparent, at illa quae ad latera, obscure; se habet hoc sicut se habet cum 
visu oculi; quae directe sub illo sunt, sunt in medio, hoc est, in centro, et apparent clare; at quae non directe sub illo sunt, sunt dissita a medio, hoc est, ad latera, et apparent obscure; oculus enim 
internus, qui est mens intellectualis et suum visum habet a luce caeli, spectat illa quae in naturali sunt, extra se, quae sunt scientifica, sicut oculus externus spectat objecta seu objectorum campum 
extra se; visus internus determinatur ad illa quae maxime delectant et quae cordi sunt, et in illis intuitionem directam figit, sicut etiam visus externus id similia in objectorum campis; ita visus 
internus ad scientifica quae cum vero et bono in quibus homo est, maxime concordant; haec scientifica illi tunc in medio sunt.  Quod visus internus spectet scientifica, est ex eo quia est spiritualis, 
et determinatur inde ad spiritualia, ita ad scientifica, nam haec cadunt sub intuitionem spiritualem. </p>
