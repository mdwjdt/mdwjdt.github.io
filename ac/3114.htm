<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3114节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3114.</strong>“我们家里既有粮草，也有很多饲料”。“粮草”表事实真理（或记忆知识形式的真理）；“很多饲料”表这些真理所具有的良善。这从“粮草”和“饲料”的含义清楚可知。“粮草”之所以表示事实真理（或记忆知识形式的真理），是因为它论及骆驼，骆驼的食物就是粮草。当“骆驼”表示属世人里面的一般记忆知识时，属世人的食物，也就是“粮草”不可能有其它含义，因为属世人没有其它维持其生命的食物。属世人的滋养来自这类真理，因为若缺乏这类食物，也就是说，缺乏知识，属世人将不复存在。这一事实从死后的生命明显看出来，因为到那时，灵人以这类事物替代食物（参看<a href="56.htm">56</a>-<a href="58.htm">58</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="681.htm">681</a>，<a href="1480.htm">1480</a>，<a href="1695.htm">1695</a>，<a href="1973.htm">1973</a>，<a href="1974.htm">1974</a>节）。和理性人一样，属世人里面一般有两类事物构成它的本质，即构成理解力的事物和构成意愿的事物。真理属于构成理解力的事物，良善属于构成意愿的事物。存在于属世人中的真理是事实真理（或记忆知识形式的真理），即存放在其外部记忆中的一切事物。当论述的主题是骆驼、马、骡子和驴时，这些就是“粮草”所表示的。而存在于属世人中的良善主要是对这些真理的情感所具有的快乐，这些良善由“饲料”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3114</b></p><p><b>3114.</b>
We have both straw and much provender. That "straw" signifies truths in the form of memory-knowledge, and that "much provender" signifies their goods, is evident from the signification of "straw" and 
of "provender." That "straw" signifies these truths, is because it is spoken of as being the food of camels; for when by "camels" is signified the natural man as to the general memory-knowledges therein, 
then by their food, namely, by straw, nothing else than these can be signified; for the natural man has no other food which is the food of its life, seeing that its nourishment is from such truths; 
for if such food should fail it, that is, knowing, it would not continue to exist. That this is the case, is evident from the life after death; for then such things are to spirits in place of food 
(see n. 56-58, 680, 681, 1480, 1695, 1973, 1974). In the natural man, as in the rational, there are two classes of things in general which constitute its essence, namely, those of the understanding and 
those of the will. To the things of the understanding pertain truths; to those of the will pertain goods. The truths of the natural man are truths in the form of memory-knowledge, that is, whatever 
things are in his external memory; these are what are signified by "straw," when camels, and also when horses, mules, and asses are treated of. But the goods of the natural man are delights, chiefly those 
of the affection of such truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3114</b></p><p><b>3114.</b>
'There is both straw' means factual truths, 'and also much fodder with us' means the goods that go with these. This is clear from the meaning of 'straw' and 'fodder'. The reason 'straw' means factual 
truths is that it has reference to camels, whose food is such; for when 'camels' means the natural man as regards the general facts there, the food of the natural man - 'straw' - cannot have any other 
meaning, since no other food exists to sustain his life. The nourishment of the natural man is received from this, for if deprived of that food, that is to say, of knowledge, the natural man would cease 
to exist. The truth of this is evident from the life after death, for in that life spirits receive such things in place of food, see <a href="56.htm">56</a>-<a href="58.htm">58</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="681.htm">681</a>, <a href="1480.htm">1480</a>, <a href="1695.htm">1695</a>, <a href="1973.htm">1973</a>, <a href="1974.htm">1974</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Within the natural 
man, as within the rational man, there exist in general two kinds of things which constitute its essence - those that make up the understanding and those that make up the will. Truths belong to 
the things constituting the understanding, goods belong to those constituting the will. The truths present in the natural man are factual truths- that is to say, all the things housed in his external 
memory - and it is these that are meant by 'straw' when camels, and also horses, mules and asses are the subject. But the goods present in the natural man are chiefly the delights that go with an affection 
for those truths, and it is these goods that are meant by 'fodder'. </p>

</p><b>3114.</b>
`Etiam stramen': quod significet vera scientifica; `etiam pabulum multum': quod significet bona eorum, constat a significatione `straminis et pabuli': quod `stramen' significet vera scientifica, inde 
est quia praedicatur de camelis, quibus tale est cibus; cum enim per `camelos' significatur naturalis homo quoad communia scientifica ibi, tunc per cibum ejus, nempe per `stramen,' non aliud significari 
potest, non enim ei alius cibus est qui vitae ejus; nutritio ejus est inde; si enim ei deficeret talis cibus, nempe scire, non subsisteret; quod ita sit, patet a vita post mortem, tunc enim talia 
spiritibus loco cibi sunt, videatur n. 56-58, 680, 681, 1480, 1695, 1973, 1974. [2] In naturali homine, sicut in rationali, sunt duo in communi, quae constituunt essentiam ejus, nempe intellectualia 
et voluntaria; ad intellectualia pertinent vera, ad voluntaria pertinent bona; vera naturalis hominis sunt vera scientifica, quaecumque nempe in memoria ejus externa sunt, haec sunt quae significantur 
per `stramen' cum agitur de camelis, etiam de equis, mulis et asinis; bona autem naturalis hominis, sunt jucunda imprimis quae sunt affectionis illorum verorum, [haec sunt quae significantur per `pabulum.'] </p>
