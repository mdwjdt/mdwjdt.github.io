<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6693节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6693.</strong>“说，所生的一切儿子，你们都要丢在河里”表所出现的一切真理都要被淹死在虚假之中。这从“儿子”和“河”的含义清楚可知：“儿子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；“河”是指构成聪明的事物（<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="109.htm">109</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3051.htm">3051</a>节），此处在反面意义上是指那些为对立面的事物，因而是指虚假。“丢”表示淹死，这是很明显的。<br />“埃及的河”表示聪明的对立面，也就是虚假，这也清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />江河必退去；河旁、河口边的纸莎草，河的一切种都必枯干，被吹散，归于无有；打鱼的必哀哭，垂钓于河中的必都悲伤，在水面上撒网的必都衰弱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.6.htm">19:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处埃及的“河”不是指河，“打鱼的”也不指渔夫，而是指其它事物；这些事物并未显明，除非人知道“埃及”、那里的“河”和“打鱼的”是什么意思。若知道这些事，这几节经文的含义就显而易见了。“埃及的河”表示虚假，这一点此处所提到的每个细节明显看出来。<br />耶利米书：<br />这像河涨发，其水翻腾像江河的，是谁呢？埃及像河涨发，其水翻腾像江河；因为他说，我要涨发遮盖遍地，我要毁灭城邑和其中的居民。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.7.htm">46:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处“埃及的河”也表示虚假；“涨发遮盖遍地”表示压垮教会；“毁灭城邑”表示毁灭教会的教义；“和其中的居民”表示来自这些教义的良善。“地”是指教会（参看<a href="6649.htm">6649</a>节）；“城”是指教会的教义（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）；“其中的居民”是指其中的良善（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）。<br />以西结书：<br />看哪，埃及王法老，我反对你这卧在自己河中的大鲸鱼；你曾说，这河是我的，是我为自己造的。我必将钩子放在你的腮颊，又使你江河中的鱼贴住你的鳞甲；我必将你和你河中所有贴住你鳞甲的鱼，从江河中拉上来。把你并你河中所有的鱼都丢在旷野。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.3.htm">29:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.10.htm">10</a>）<br />若没有内义，没有人能知道这段经文是什么意思。显然，这不是埃及这个国家；除非知道“法老”、“河”、“鲸鱼”、“鱼”和“鳞甲”分别表示什么，否则这段经文的意思不为人知。“法老”是指记忆知识所在的属世层（参看<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>，<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>，<a href="6015.htm">6015</a>节）；“鲸鱼”是指属世层中记忆知识的总体（<a href="42.htm">42</a>节）；“鱼”是指总体之下的记忆知识（<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="991.htm">991</a>节）；“鳞甲”是指那些显现于外在的事物，或说完全外在性质的观念，因而是指感官印象，虚假的记忆知识就粘附在这些感官印象上。当知道这些事物时，就能明白上述经文中埃及的“河”表示什么，即表示虚假。<br /><br />法老下阴间的那日，我便使人悲哀。我为他遮盖深渊，使他的江河凝结，大水停流。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.15.htm">31:15</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />地岂不因这事震动？其上的居民不也悲哀吗？地必全然像江河涨起，如同埃及河涌出退落。到那日，我必使日头在午间落下，使地在光明之日黑暗。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.8.htm">8:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.5.htm">9:5</a>）<br />要“震动”的“地”表示教会（<a href="6649.htm">6649</a>节）；“如同埃及河退落”表示被虚假毁灭；由于所表示的是虚假，故经上说“日头在午间落下”、“地在光明之日黑暗”。“日头在午间落下”表示天堂之爱的良善将退离，“地在光明之日黑暗”表示虚假将占据教会。“日头”是指天堂之爱的良善（参看<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>节）；“黑暗”是指虚假（<a href="1839.htm">1839</a>，<a href="1860.htm">1860</a>，<a href="4418.htm">4418</a>，<a href="4531.htm">4531</a>节）；“地”是指教会（<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1411.htm">1411</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="2355.htm">2355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>节）。谁都能看出，此处所表示的是其它事物，而非显现在文字上的事物，如：“地要震动”、“其上的居民要悲哀”、“日头在午间落下”、“地在光明之日黑暗”。除非把“地”理解为教会，“河”理解为虚假，“日头”理解为天堂之爱，否则，在那里找不到任何可解释的意义。<br />由于“埃及的河”表示虚假，故摩西被吩咐用杖击打那河的水，水就变作血，所有的鱼都死在河里，河也腥臭（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.17.htm">7:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.21.htm">21</a>）。由于同样的原因，亚伦也被吩咐用杖伸手在江、河、池以上，使青蛙上埃及地来（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.5.htm">8:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.6.htm">6</a>）。“水”在反面意义上表示虚假（参看<a href="790.htm">790</a>节）；由于水构成河，故相对于水来说，“河”表示总体上的虚假。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6693</b></p><p><b>6693.</b>
Saying, Every son that is born, ye shall cast him forth into the river. That this signifies that they should immerse in falsities all truths which appear, is evident from the signification of "son," 
as being truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and from the signification of "river," as being things that belong to intelligence (n. 108, 109, 2702, 3051), here in the opposite sense, things 
contrary, thus falsities. That "to cast forth" denotes to immerse is manifest. [2] That the "river of Egypt" denotes what is contrary to intelligence, thus falsity, is evident also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>    
 The rivers shall recede; the rivers of Egypt shall diminish and be dried up; the papyri beside the river, beside the mouth of the river, and all the seed of the river, shall become dry, shall be driven 
forward; and therefore the fishers shall mourn, and all they that cast a hook into the river shall be sad, and they that spread a net upon the faces of the waters shall languish (Isa. 19:6-8); </p>
<p>that 
here by the "river of Egypt" no river is meant, nor by "fishers" fishers, but that other things are meant, which do not appear unless it is known what is meant by "Egypt," by the "river" there, and 
by "fishers," is also evident; if these things are known, the sense is manifest. That by the "river of Egypt" is signified falsity, is plain from the particulars here. [3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Who is this 
that riseth up like the river, whose waters are tossed like the rivers? Egypt riseth up like the river, and his waters are tossed as the rivers; for he hath said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, 
I will destroy the city, and them that dwell therein (Jer. 46:7-8); </p>
<p>here also the "river of Egypt" denotes falsities; to "go up and cover the earth" denotes to do so to the church; to "destroy the 
city," denotes to destroy the doctrine of the church; "and them that dwell therein," denotes the goods thence derived. (That the "earth" is the church may be seen above, n. 6649; and the "city," the 
doctrine of the church, n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492, 4493; and "inhabitants," the goods therein, n. 2268, 2451, 2712.) [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great 
whale that liest in the midst of his rivers; who hath said, The river is mine, and I have made myself. Therefore I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will make the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy 
scales, and I will make thee go up out of the midst of thy rivers, and every fish of thy rivers shall stick in thy scales. I will leave thee in the wilderness, and every fish of thy rivers (Ezek. 29:3-5, 
9-10); </p>
<p>what these things signify no one can know without the internal sense (that Egypt is not meant, is evident), thus unless it is known what is meant by "Pharaoh," and what by a "river," a "whale," 
a "fish," and "scales." (That "Pharaoh" is the natural where memory-knowledge is, may be seen above, n. 5160, 5799, 6015; and that "whales" are the generals of memory-knowledges in the natural, 
n. 42; and "fishes" memory-knowledges under the general, n. 40, 991.) "Scales" denote those things which are manifestly external, thus sensuous, to which memory-knowledges which are falsities adhere. 
When these things are known, it is evident what is meant in the above passage by the "river of Egypt" namely, falsity. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     In that day when Pharaoh shall go down into hell I will make a 
mourning; I will cover the abyss over him, and I will curb his rivers, and the great waters shall be dammed up (Ezek. 31:15).      Shall not the earth be shaken for this, and everyone mourn that dwelleth 
therein, so that it shall go up all of it like a brook, and be driven out, and overwhelmed as by the river of Egypt? In that day I will make the sun to set at noon, and I will darken the earth in 
the day of light (Amos 8:8-9; 9:5); </p>
<p>the "earth" which shall be "shaken" denotes the church (n. 6649); "to be overwhelmed as by the river of Egypt" denotes to perish by falsities; and because falsities 
are signified, it is said that "the sun shall set at noon," and that "the earth shall be darkened in the day of light." By "the sun setting at noon" is signified that the good of celestial love would 
recede, and by "the earth being darkened in the day of light," that falsities would take possession of the church. (That the "sun" is the good of celestial love, may be seen above, n. 1529, 1530, 2441, 
2495, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4696; also that "darkness" is falsity, n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531; and that the "earth" is the church, n. 82, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1411, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 
2928, 2355, 4447, 4535, 5577.) Everyone can see that other things are signified here than what appear in the letter, as that "the earth shall be shaken," and that "everyone that dwelleth therein shall 
mourn," that "the sun shall set at noon," and "the earth be darkened in the day of light." Unless the church is understood by the "earth," falsity by the "river," and celestial love by the "sun," 
no sense which can be unfolded is found there. [6] As the "river of Egypt" signifies falsity, therefore Moses was commanded to smite with his staff upon the waters of that river, and they were consequently 
turned into blood, and every fish died in the river, and the river stank (Exod. 7:17-21); and Aaron also was commanded to stretch out his hand with the rod over the rivers, over the streams, and 
over the pools, whereupon frogs came up over the land of Egypt (Exod. 8:1, 2). That "waters" in the opposite sense signify falsities (see n. 790); and as the waters are those of the river, the "river" 
relatively denotes falsity in general. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6693</b></p><p><b>6693.</b>
'Saying, Every son who is born you are to throw into the river' means that all truths that appeared should be drowned in falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'son' as truth, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>; from the meaning of 'being born' as appearing; and from the meaning of 'the river' as those things that constitute intelligence, dealt with in <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="109.htm">109</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3051.htm">3051</a>, here 
in the contrary sense as those things which are the opposite, namely falsities. The fact that 'throwing into' means drowning in is self-evident. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The meaning of 'the river of Egypt' as the opposite 
of intelligence, which is falsity, is also clear in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The rivers will recede, the streams of Egypt will diminish and dry up. The papyrus plants next to the river, next to the mouth of the 
river, and everything sown in the river will wither, be driven away, and be no more. Therefore the fishermen will mourn, and all who cast a hook into the river will be sad, and those who spread nets 
over the face of the waters will anguish. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:6-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here one should not understand a river by 'the river of Egypt' or fishermen by 'the fishermen' but other things which are not apparent unless 
one knows how 'Egypt', 'the river' there, and 'the fishermen' are to be understood. If one does know, then the meaning of these verses is apparent. The fact that 'the river of Egypt' means falsity is 
evident from every detail mentioned in them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this coming up like a river, whose waters are tossed about like the rivers? Egypt comes up like the river, and like the rivers 
his waters are tossed about. For he said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those who dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'the river of Egypt' stands for falsities. 
'Going up and covering the earth' stands for overwhelming the Church, 'destroying the city' stands for destroying the teachings of the Church, 'and those who dwell in it' for doing so to forms of 
good that come from those teachings. For the meaning of 'the earth' as the Church, see <a href="6649.htm">6649</a>; 'the city' as the teachings of the Church, <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4492.htm">4492</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>; and 'those who dwell in it' as forms 
of good there, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in the midst of his rivers, who has said, The river is mine and I 
have made myself. Therefore I will put hooks in your jaws, and cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will cause you to come up out of the midst of your rivers, in order that<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 
all the fish of your rivers may stick in your scales. I will leave in the wilderness you and all the fish of your rivers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2029:3-5,%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 29:3-5, 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Without the internal sense no one can know what this passage 
means either. Thus, though it is evident that it is not the country Egypt which is meant, the meaning of the passage remains unknown unless one knows what 'Pharaoh', 'river', 'monster', 'fish', 
and 'scales', all mean. 'Pharaoh' is the natural where factual knowledge resides, see <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>, <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>, <a href="6015.htm">6015</a>; 'monsters' are general bodies of facts that reside in the natural, <a href="42.htm">42</a>; 'fish' are the facts subordinate 
to a general body of them, <a href="40.htm">40</a>, <a href="991.htm">991</a>; 'scales' are ideas of a thoroughly external nature, thus sensory impressions, to which factual knowledge that is false clings. When one knows all these meanings 
one can see what 'the river of Egypt' is used to mean in this passage, namely, falsity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
On the day on which Pharaoh goes down into hell I will make him mourn, I will 
cover the deep over him, and I will restrain its streams, and the great waters will be stayed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Is not the land to be shaken on account of this, and everyone to mourn that 
inhabits it? Yes, the whole of it comes up like a river, and is cast out, and is drowned as if in the river of Egypt. On that day I will make the sun go down at noon, and I will darken the land in 
broad daylight. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:8,%209;%209:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:8, 9; 9:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The land which will be shaken' stands for the Church, <a href="6649.htm">6649</a>, while 'being drowned as if in the river of Egypt' stands for being destroyed by falsities. And since falsities 
are meant it says that the sun will go down at noon, and the earth will be darkened in broad daylight. 'The going down of the sun at noon' means that the good of heavenly love will depart, and 
'the darkening of the land in broad daylight' that falsities will take possession of the Church. For the meaning of 'the sun' as the good of heavenly love, see <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, 
<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>; for 'darkness' as falsities, <a href="1839.htm">1839</a>, <a href="1860.htm">1860</a>, <a href="4418.htm">4418</a>, <a href="4531.htm">4531</a>; and for 'the earth' as the Church, <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1411.htm">1411</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>. 
Anyone can see that things other than those which appear in the literal sense here - such as that the land will be shaken and every inhabitant will mourn, or that the sun will go down at noon and the 
land will be darkened in broad daylight - are really meant. Unless one takes 'the land' to mean the Church, 'the river' to mean falsity, and 'the sun' to mean heavenly love, one does not find any other 
explicable meaning there.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 It is because 'the river of Egypt' means falsity that Moses was commanded to strike the waters of that river with his rod, after which they were turned into blood, 
all fish in the river died, and the river stank, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%207:17,%2018,%2020,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 7:17, 18, 20, 21</a>. For the same reason Aaron had to stretch out his hand and rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools, from which 
frogs rose up over the land of Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%208:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 8:5, 6</a>.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> For the meaning of 'the waters' in the contrary sense as falsities, see <a href="790.htm">790</a>; and since the waters make up the river, 'the river' in relation 
to them means falsity in general.

</p><b>6693.</b>
`Dicendo, Omnem filium qui nascitur in flumen projiciatis [illum]': quod significet quod omnia vera quae apparent immergerent falsis, constat ex significatione `filii' quod sit verum, de qua n. 489, 
491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373; ex significatione `nasci' quod sit apparere, et ex significatione `fluminis' quod sint illa quae sunt intelligentiae, de qua n. 108, 109, 2702, 3051, hic in opposito sensu 
quae contraria (d)sunt, ita falsa; quod `projicere' sit immergere patet. 	2 Quod `flumen Aegypti' sit contrarium intelligentiae, ita falsum constat quoque apud Esaiam, Recedent flumina, comminuentur 
et exsiccabuntur fluvii Aegypti, papyri juxta flumen, juxta os fluminis, et omne semen fluminis exarescet, impelletur, et non ideo lugebunt piscatores, et tristes erunt omnes projicientes in flumen 
hamum, et expandentes rete super facies aquarum languescent, xix (x)5-8'; </p>
<p>quod hic per `flumen Aegypti' non flumen intelligatur, {1} nec piscatores per `piscatores,' sed quod alia quae non patent nisi 
sciatur quid per `Aegyptum,' per `flumen' ibi, et per `piscatores' intelligitur; si (c)illa sciuntur, patet sensus; quod per `flumen Aegypti' significetur falsum, 3 ex singulis ibi {2}patet: apud Jeremiam, Quis 
hic sicut flumen ascendit, cujus aquae sicut flumina commoventur?  Aegyptus sicut flumen ascendit, et sicut flumina commoventur aquae ejus, nam dixit, Ascendam, obtegam terram, perdam urbem, 
et habitantes in ea, xlvi 7, 8; </p>
<p>hic quoque `flumen Aegypti' pro falsis; `ascendere et obtegere terram' pro Ecclesiam; `perdere urbem' pro doctrinam Ecclesiae, et `habitantes in ea' pro bona quae 
inde; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 6649; quod `urbs' sit doctrina {3}Ecclesiae, n. 402, (x)2449, 3216, 4492, 4493; et quod `habitatores' sint bona {4}ibi, n. 2268, 2451, 2712 apud Ezechielem, 
4 Ecce Ego contra te Pharao rex Aegypti, balaena magna, quae cubas in medio fluviorum suorum; qui dixit, Meus est fluvius, et ego feci me; propterea dabo hamos in maxillas tuas, et adhaerere faciam 
pisces fluviorum tuorum squamis tuis, et faciam ascendere te e medio fluviorum tuorum, et omnis piscis fluviorum tuorum in squamis tuis haereat; relinquam in deserto te, et omnem piscem fluviorum tuorum, 
xxix 3-5, 9, 10; </p>
<p>quid haec significant, nec quisquam scire potest absque sensu interno; quod non Aegyptus intelligatur, patet; ita nisi sciatur quid `Pharao,' quid `flumen,' quid `balaena,' quid 
{5}`piscis,' quid `squamae'; quod `Pharao' sit naturale ubi scientificum, videatur n. (x)5160, 5799, 6015; quod `balaenae' sint communia scientificorum quae in naturali, n. 42; quod `pisces' sint scientifica 
sub communi, n. 40, 991; `squamae' sunt illa quae plane externa sunt, ita sensualia, quibus scientifica quae falsa adhaerent; ex his {6}cognitis (x)patet quid ibi per `flumen Aegypti' intelligitur, 
quod nempe falsum: apud eundem, 5 In die illo, quo descensurus est Pharao in infernum, lugere faciam, obtegam super eum abyssum, et inhibebo flumina ejus, et occludentur aquae magnae, xxxi 15: </p>
<p>apud 
Amos, Num propter hoc non commoveatur terra, et lugeat omnis habitans in ea ita ut ascendat sicut rivus tota, et expellatur, et submergatur sicut flumine Aegypti; in die illo occidere faciam 
solem in meridie, et obtenebrabo terram in die lucis, viii 8, 9, ix 5; </p>
<p>`terra quae commovebitur' pro Ecclesia, n. 6649, `submergi sicut flumine Aegypti' pro a falsis perire; et quia falsa significantur, 
dicitur quod `occidet sol in meridie, et obtenebrabitur terra in die lucis'; per `occidere sol in meridie' significatur quod bonum amoris caelestis {7}recedet, et per `{8}obtenebrari terra in die 
lucis' quod falsa Ecclesiam occupabunt; quod `sol' sit bonum amoris caelestis, videatur n. 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4696; quod `tenebrae' sint falsa, n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531; et quod 
`terra' sit Ecclesia, n. 82, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1411, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577; quisque videre potest quod {9} alia (x)significentur quam quae {10}apparent 
ibi in littera, ut quod commovebitur terra, et lugebit omnis habitans in (c)ea, quod occidet sol in meridie, et obtenebrabitur terra in die lucis; nisi Ecclesia intelligatur per `terram,' falsum 
per `flumen,' amor caelestis per `solem,' non aliquis sensus qui explicari potest ibi invenitur. 	6 Quia `flumen Aegypti' significat falsum, idcirco mandatum fuit Mosi, {11}quod Percuteret baculo 
super aquas fluminis illius, et quod illae inde versae sint in sanguinem, et in flumine {12}mortuus omnis piscis, et {13}fetuit flumen, Exod. vii 17, 18, 20, 21: </p>
<p>et quoque quod Aharon extenderet manum 
cum baculo super fluvios, super flumina, et super stagna, {14}ex quo ascendebant ranae super terram Aegypti, Exod. viii 1, 2 [A.V. 5, 6]; </p>
<p>quod `aquae' in opposito sensu significent falsa, videatur 
n. 790; et quia aquae sunt fluminis, est `flumen' falsum in communi respective. 	@1 i quis non videre potest, ita$ 	@2 constare potest$ 	@3 ibi$ 	@4 inde$ 	@5 pisces,$ 	@6 notis$ 	@7 prorsus obscurabitur$ 	@8 
obtenebrare terram$ 	@9 i prorsus$ 	@10 sunt$ 	@11 ut$ 	@12 moreretur$ 	@13 foeteret$ 	@14 quod ascenderent$ </p>
