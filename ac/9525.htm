<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9525节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9525.</strong>“我所要吩咐你传给以色列人的一切事”表代表性教会的敬拜。这从“吩咐”的含义和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：当耶和华“吩咐”摩西时，“吩咐”是指那些属于敬拜的事物，因为耶和华吩咐摩西传给以色列人的一切都涉及敬拜；“以色列人”是指属灵教会（<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节），在此仅指属灵教会的一个代表，因为建立在以色列人当中的一切事物都是代表教会内在事物的外在事物；不过，它们本质上并不是内在事物本身。关于这个主题，可参看9320节末尾所提到的地方。</p>

All that I shall command thee for the sons of Israel. That this signifies the worship of the representative church, is evident from the signification of "commanding," when by Jehovah unto Moses, as being 
the things that belong to worship, for all the things Jehovah commanded Moses for the sons of Israel were such as concerned worship; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the 
spiritual church (n. 9340), here the spiritual church represented; for all things instituted among the sons of Israel were external things that represented the internal things of the church; but they 
were not the internal things themselves in their essence (on which subject see the citations in n. 9320). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9525</b></p><p><b>9525.</b>
'Everything that I shall command you for the children of Israel' means the worship of the representative Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'commanding', when done by Jehovah addressing Moses, 
as those things that belong to worship, for everything that Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel was such as had to do with worship; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' 
as the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>, at this point simply a representation of the spiritual Church, for all the things that had been established among the children of Israel were outward ceremonies 
that did no more than represent the inner realities of the Church and had nothing of those realities themselves within them. Regarding this see the places referred to at the end of <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>.  </p>

</p><b>9525.</b>
`Omne quod praecipiam tibi ad filios Israelis': quod significet cultum Ecclesiae repraesentativae, constat ex significatione `praecipere' cum a Jehovah Moschi, quod sint illa quae cultus, nam omnia 
quae Jehovah praecepit Moschi ad filios Israelis, erant talia quae concernebant cultum, et a repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint Ecclesia spiritualis, de qua n. 9340, hic Ecclesia spiritualis 
repraesentata, nam omnia quae apud filios Israelis instituta fuerunt erant externa quae repraesentabant interna Ecclesiae, non autem ipsa interna in sua essentia, de qua re videantur citata n. 9320 fin. </p>
