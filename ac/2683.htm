<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2683节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2683.</strong>创世记21:16.自己走开，退后约一箭之远，独自在远处坐下；因为她说，我不忍见这孩子死！就在远处坐下，放声大哭。<br />“自己走开，独自在远处坐下”表思想状态。“退后约一箭之远”表那种状态距离真理的教义何等遥远，“箭”表真理的教义。“因为她说，我不忍见这孩子死”表对属灵真理就要这样灭亡而悲伤。“就在远处坐下”表思想状态。“放声大哭”表愈加悲伤。</p>

Verse 16. And she went and sat by herself over against him, withdrawing about a bowshot; for she said, Let me not see the death of the child; and she sat over against him; and she lifted up her voice 
and wept. "She went and sat by herself over against him," signifies a state of thought; "withdrawing about a bowshot," signifies how far that state was from the doctrine of truth (a "bow" is the doctrine 
of truth); "for she said, Let me not see the death of the child," signifies grief that it should thus perish; "and she sat over against him," signifies a state of thought; "and she lifted up her 
voice and wept," signifies a further degree of grief. </p>

Verse 16 And she went and sat by herself some distance away, withdrawing herself about a bowshot, for she said, Let me not see the death of the boy. And she sat some distance away and lifted up her voice 
and wept. </p>
<p>'She went and sat by herself some distance away' means a state of thought. 'Withdrawing herself about a bowshot' means the extent to which the state was away from the doctrine of truth, 
'a bow' meaning the doctrine of truth. 'For she said, Let me not see the death of the boy' means grief that [spiritual truth] would thus perish. 'And she sat some distance away' means a state of thought. 
'And lifted up her voice and wept' means a further degree of grief. </p>

Vers. 16.  Et ivit, et sedit sibi e regione, elongando se circiter jactum arcus, quia dixit, Ne videam mortem pueri, et sedit regione, et sustulit vocem suam, et flevit. `Ivit, et sedit sibi e regione 
significat statum cogitationis: `elongando se circiter jactum arcus' significat statum quantum abesset a doctrina veri; `arcus' est doctrina veri: `quia dixit, Ne videam mortem pueri' significat dolorem 
quod sic periret: `et sedit e regione' significat cogitationis statum: `et sustuli vocem et flevit' significat doloris ulteriorem gradum. </p>
