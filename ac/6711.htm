<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6711节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6711.</strong>但那些没有爱自己胜过他人的人（凡属主国度的人都是如此）却将从他们当爱之高于一切的那一们，也就是从主那里获得邻舍的起源；他们会照各人对主之爱的品质而视其为邻舍。因此，爱人如己的人，尤其那些像天使一样爱他人胜过自己的人都从主那里获得邻舍的起源；事实上，主自己就在良善中，因为良善从祂发出。由此也可以看出来，爱的品质决定了谁是邻舍。主存在于良善里面，主自己在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">40</a>）中教导了这一点；因为祂对那些处于良善的人说，他们“给祂吃”、“给祂喝，留祂住，给祂穿，看顾祂，在监里来看祂”；然后又说“这些事他们既作在祂这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在祂身上了”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">40</a>）。</p>

But they who do not love themselves more than others, as is the case with all who are of the Lord's kingdom, will derive the origin of the neighbor from Him whom they ought to love above all things, 
that is, from the Lord; and will regard everyone as the neighbor according to the quality of his love to Him. They therefore who love others as themselves, and especially those who-like the angels-love 
others more than themselves, all derive the origin of the neighbor from the Lord; for the Lord Himself is in good, because it proceeds from Him. Hence also it can be seen that the quality of the love 
determines who is the neighbor. That the Lord is in good, He Himself teaches in Matthew; for He says to those who had been in good, that they "had given Him to eat," that they "had given Him to drink, 
had gathered Him, clothed Him, visited Him, and had come to Him in prison;" and afterward, that "insofar as they had done it to one of the least of His brethren, they had done it to Him" (Matt. 25:34-40). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6711</b></p><p><b>6711.</b>
But those who do not love themselves more than others - which is true of everyone belonging to the Lord's kingdom - will make the origin of the neighbour reside in Him whom they ought to love above all 
else, that is, in the Lord. And they will see the neighbour in all others according to the nature of their love for Him. People therefore who love others as themselves, and especially those who, like 
the angels, love others more than themselves, all make the origin of the neighbour reside in the Lord; for good has the Lord Himself within it since it emanates from Him. From this too it may be seen 
that what the love is like determines who the neighbour is. The truth that the Lord is present within good is what the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2025:34-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 25:34-40</a>, for He says to those who were governed 
by good that they had given Him food, given Him drink, taken Him in, clothed Him, visited Him, and come to Him in prison, and then that insofar as they had done so to one of the least of His brothers 
they had done so to Him. </p>

</p><b>6711.</b>
Qui autem se non amant prae aliis, prout omnes qui ea regno Domini sunt, originem proximi ducent ab Ipso Quem supra omnia amare debent, ita a Domino; et pro proximo habebunt unumquemvis secundum quale 
amoris in Ipsum.  Qui itaque alios amant sicut se, et magis qui, {1}ut angeli alios plus quam se, ii omnes originem proximi ducunt a Domino, nam in bono est Ipse Dominus, procedit enim ab Ipso; inde 
quoque constare potest quod quale amoris determinet quis proximus.  Quod Dominus sit in bono, Ipse Dominus docet apud Matthaeum, Dicit enim illis qui in bono fuerunt, quod illi dederint Ipsi quod ederet, 
quod illi potaverint Ipsum, collegerint Ipsum, induerint Ipsum, visitaverint Ipsum, et in (x)custodia venerint ad Ipsum; et dein quod quantum fecerint uni ex fratribus Suis minimis, Ipsi fecerint,
