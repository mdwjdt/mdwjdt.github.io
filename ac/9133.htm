<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9133.</strong>“他所偷来的，若确实发现在他手中”表如果还有什么真理或良善留下，能用来作出恢复。这从“确实发现”、“在他手中”和“所偷来的”的含义清楚可知：“确实发现”当论及“所偷来的”所表示的被夺走良善或真理时，是指留下；“在他手中”是指在他的能力中，“手”表示能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="5544.htm">5544</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>，<a href="8050.htm">8050</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>，<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>节），“在他手中”也表示与他同在之物，这一点可见于下文；“所偷来的”是指被夺走的良善或真理（<a href="9125.htm">9125</a>节）。由此明显可知，“所偷来的若确实发现在他手中”表示如果还有什么真理或良善留下。它之所以也表示能以此作出恢复，是因为本节论述的主题是对被夺走的良善或真理的恢复。此处的情形是这样：只要对良善的一种总体情感仍然存在，就总有某种东西留下来，使得被夺走的某种具体良善能通过它得以恢复，或说能通过用这种东西来代替被夺走的某种具体良善而作出恢复；因为具体的良善和真理取决于总体的良善（参看<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="1040.htm">1040</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="4269.htm">4269</a>，<a href="4325.htm">4325</a>e，<a href="4329.htm">4329</a>，<a href="4345.htm">4345</a>，<a href="4383.htm">4383</a>，<a href="5208.htm">5208</a>，<a href="6115.htm">6115</a>，<a href="7131.htm">7131</a>节）。“在他手中”之所以表示凡与他同在之物，是因为“手”表示能力，凡在一个人的能力范围之内的，都与他同在，凡不在他能力范围之内的，都不与他同在。这一点也是“手”，尤其“右手”表示此人自己的原因。由此可见当论及主时，“坐在父的右手边”是什么意思，即：祂是与父同在的一切，因而是父自己。主在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.8.htm">14:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">17:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.11.htm">11</a>）中的这一教导也表示这一点，即：祂在父里面，父在祂里面，以及凡是祂的，都是父的，凡是父的，都是祂的这一教导。</p>

If finding the theft be found in his hand. That this signifies if there be anything remaining of truth and good by which restoration can be made, is evident from the signification of "finding there be 
found," when said of the good or truth that has been taken away, which is signified by the "theft," as being to remain; from the signification of "in his hand," as being in his power (that "the hand" 
denotes power, see n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 7011, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8153, 8281; that "in his hand" also denotes that which appertains to him, will be seen below); 
and from the signification of "theft," as being the good or the truth that has been taken away (n. 9125). From this it is plain that by "if finding the theft be found in his hand" is signified if there 
be anything remaining of good and truth. That it also means whereby restoration can be made, is because this verse treats of the restoration of the good and truth that have been taken away. The case 
herein is this. So long as a general affection of good remains, there always remains something by means of which any particular good that has been taken away may be restored, for particular goods and 
truths depend upon a general good (n. 920, 1040, 1316, 4269, 4325, 4329, 4345,  4383, 5208, 6115, 7131). That "in his hand" denotes whatever appertains to him, is because by "the hand" is signified 
power, and whatever is in anyone's power appertains to him. Consequently by "the hand," especially by "the right hand," is signified the man himself. From all this it can be seen what is signified by 
"sitting at the right hand of the Father," when this is said of the Lord, as being to be everything with the Father, thus to be the Father Himself; which is the same as to be in the Father and the Father 
in Him; and as all things that are His being the Father's, and all that are the Father's being His; as the Lord teaches in John 14:8-11; 17:10-11. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9133</b></p><p><b>9133.</b>
'If the theft is certainly found in his hand' means if any truth or good is left by means of which restoration can be made. This is clear from the meaning of 'certainly being found' - when it refers 
to good or truth that has been taken away, meant by 'the theft' - as being left; from the meaning of 'in his hand' as in his power ('hand' means power, see <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="5544.htm">5544</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>, <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>, <a href="8050.htm">8050</a>, <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>, <a href="8281.htm">8281</a>; and the fact that 'in his hand' also means what resides with him will be seen below); and from the meaning of 'the theft' as the good or truth that has 
been taken away, dealt with in <a href="9125.htm">9125</a>. From all this it is evident that 'if the theft is certainly found in his hand' means if any good or truth is left. The reason why by means of which restoration can 
be made is also meant is that restoration for the good or truth that has been taken away is the subject in the present verse. The situation is that when a general affection for good remains there is 
always something left by means of which restoration can be made to replace some particular form of good that has been taken away; for it is on the general form of good that particular forms of it and 
particular truths depend, see  <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="1040.htm">1040</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="4269.htm">4269</a>, <a href="4325.htm">4325</a> (end), <a href="4329.htm">4329</a>, <a href="4345.htm">4345</a>, <a href="4383.htm">4383</a>, <a href="5208.htm">5208</a>, <a href="6115.htm">6115</a>, <a href="7131.htm">7131</a>. The reason why 'in his hand' is whatever resides with him is that 'the hand' means power, and whatever 
is within a person's power resides with him, and what is not in his power does not reside with him. This also is the reason why 'hand', especially 'right hand', is used to mean the person himself. 
From all this one may see what is meant by 'sitting on the right hand of the Father' when said of the Lord, that He is everything residing with the Father, and so is the Father Himself. The same 
thing is meant in the Lord's teaching in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:8-11;%2017:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:8-11; 17:10, 11</a>, about His being in the Father, and the Father in Him, and about all things that are His being the Father's, and all that are the Father's 
being His.  </p>

`Si inveniendo inventum fuerit in manu illius furtum': quod significet si ex vero et bono supersit per quod restitui possit, constat ex significatione `inveniendo inveniri' cum de bono aut {1} vero 
ablato, quod significatur per `furtum,' quod sit superesse; ex significatione `in manu ejus' quod sit in potentia ejus; quod `manus' sit potentia, videatur n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 
7011, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8153, 8281; quod in manu ejus quoque sit quod {2} apud illum, (o)videbitur infra; et ex significatione `furti' quod sit bonum aut verum ablatum, de qua {3} n. 
9125; inde patet quod `si inveniendo inventum fuerit in manu illius furtum' significet si ex bono et vero supersit; quod etiam sit per quod restitui possit, est quia de restitutione boni et veri ablati 
in hoc versu agitur; (o)sed cum hoc ita se habet: quando communis affectio boni manet {4}, tunc semper superest per quod bonum aliquod particulare ablatum restitui potest, a communi enim bono pendent 
bona et vera particularia, videatur n. 920, 1040, 1316, 4269, 4325 fin., 4329, 4345, 4383, 5208, 6115, 7131.  Quod `in manu (c)illius' sit quicquid apud illum, est quia per `manum' significatur potentia, 
et quicquid {5} est potentiae alicujus est apud illum, et quod non est potentiae, hoc non est apud illum; inde etiam per `manum,' {6} imprimis per `dextram,' significatur ipse; ex quibus constare 
potest quid significatur per `sedere ad dextram Patris' ubi de Domino, quod sit esse omne apud Patrem, ita (o)esse Ipse; quod idem est cum esse in Patre et Pater in Ipso, (o)et esse omnia Sua Patris, 
et omnia Patris Sua, quod Dominus docet apud Johannem xiv 8-11, {7} xvii 10, 11. @1 et$ @2 inde quoque in manu ejus est$ @3 i supra$ @4 affectio boni communis remanet$ @5 nam etiam omne id quod$ @6
