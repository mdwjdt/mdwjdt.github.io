<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4038节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4038.</strong>“骆驼和驴”表良善之真理，无论是颇为外在的还是完全外在的。这从“骆驼”和“驴”的含义清楚可知：“骆驼”是指属世人的一般记忆知识（<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节），一般记忆知识是指较为低级或更为外在的良善之真理；“驴”是指还要低级的，也就是完全外在的属世良善之真理（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。至于何为内层良善与真理，何为居间的良善与真理，以及何为颇为外在和完全外在的良善与真理，可参看前面所述（<a href="4009.htm">4009</a>节）。<br />一般来说，人里面有三层区域，即肉体层，属世层和理性层。肉体层是最外层，属世层是居间层，理性层是内层。在人里面，只要其中一层掌管另一层，他要么被称为肉体的，要么被称为属世的，要么被称为理性的。人心智的这三个部分以奇妙的方式互通：肉体部分与属世部分相通，属世部分与理性部分相通。人刚出生时纯粹是肉体的，但里面拥有能得到完善的能力。后为，他变得属世，最后变得理性。由此可见，这一方与另一方之间是互通的。肉体部分藉着感官与属世部分相通，并且是以一种截然不同而又互相分离的方式通过属于理解或认知的事物和属于意愿的事物而相通；如果人要变成并成为完全的人，理解或认知和意愿这两种官能必须在人里面充分发展。视觉和听觉尤其服务于充分发展他的理解力，而其它三种感觉则尤其关注他的意愿。人心智的肉体部分藉着这些感觉与他的属世部分，就是前面所说的居间部分相通。因为通过感官进入的事物将自己置于属世层，如同置于一种容器。这种容器就是记忆。快乐和愉悦及其中的渴望属于意愿，被称为属世良善；记忆知识属于理解力，被称为属世真理。<br />人心智的属世部分通过刚才所提到的这些事物与其理性部分相通，这理性部分就是内层部分，如前所述。从属世层上升到理性层的事物也将自己置于理性层，如同置于一种容器。这种容器就是内部记忆，关于内部记忆，可参看前文（<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2480.htm">2480</a>节）。那里的祝福和幸福属于意愿，是理性良善的形式；而对事物的内在洞察，以及对它们的感知则属于理解或认知，这些洞察和感知的对象就被称作理性真理。这三者（即肉体层，属世层和理性性）构成人，并且这三者之间是互通的。外部感官是人心智的肉体部用来与其理性部分相通的工具；内部感官则是其心智的属世部分用来与其理性部分相通的工具。因此，那些存在于人心智的属世部分、源于适合身体的外部感官的事物就是那被称作颇为外在和完全外在的良善之真理的。而那些源于适合其灵并与理性层相通的内部感官的事物则是那被称作内层良善与真理的。介于这二者之间并参与这二者的事物就是那被称作居间良善与真理的。这三组依次始于内层，就是“羊群、仆婢、骆驼和驴”所表示的。</p>

And camels, and asses. That this signifies the truths of good, exterior and external, is evident from the signification of "camels," as being general memory-knowledges of the natural man (see n. 3048, 
3071, 3143, 3145-general memory-knowledges are the lower or more exterior truths of good), and from the signification of "asses," as being still lower, that is, the external, truths of natural good 
(see n. 2781). What the interior goods and truths are; also the mediate ones; and likewise the exterior and external ones, may be seen from what was said above (n. 4009).  [2] Speaking generally, there 
are in man three things, namely, the corporeal, the natural, and the rational. The corporeal is the outermost, the natural is the intermediate, and the rational is the interior. So far as one of these 
reigns in man above another, he is said to be either corporeal, or natural, or rational. These three parts of man communicate in a wonderful manner; the corporeal with the natural, and the natural 
with the rational. When first born, man is merely corporeal, but within has the capacity of being perfected. Afterwards he becomes natural, and at last rational; from which it may be seen that there 
is communication of one part with another. The corporeal communicates with the natural by means of the senses, and does so in a distinct and separate manner by those which belong to the understanding, 
and by those which belong to the will, for both of these faculties must be perfected in man in order that he may become and may be a man. The senses of sight and hearing are especially those which perfect 
his intellectual faculty; and the other three senses have especial regard to the will. By means of these senses man's corporeal communicates with his natural, which as before said is the middle 
part. For the things that enter by the senses, place themselves in the natural as in a kind of receptacle, which is the memory. The delight, the pleasure, and the desire therein, belong to the will, and 
are called natural goods; and the memory-knowledges belong to the understanding, and are called natural truths.  [3] By means of the things just spoken of, man's natural communicates with his rational, 
which as before said, is the interior part. Such things as elevate themselves from the natural toward the rational, also place themselves in the rational, as in a kind of receptacle, which is the 
interior memory (concerning which see above, n. 2469-2480). What is blessed and happy therein belongs to the will, and is of rational good; and the interior mental views of things and perceptions belong 
to the understanding, and the things that belong to these are called rational truths. These three are what constitute man, and there are communications among the three. The external senses are the 
means by which man's corporeal communicates with his natural; and the interior senses are those by which man's natural communicates with his rational. And therefore those things in the natural that 
partake of the external senses, which are proper to the body, are those which are called the exterior and external truths of good; but those which partake of the internal senses which are proper to his 
spirit, and which communicate with the rational, are what are called interior goods and truths. Those which are between the two, and partake of both, are what are called mediate goods and truths. These 
three are in order from the interiors, and are what are signified in the internal sense by "flocks, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4038</b></p><p><b>4038.</b>
'And camels and asses' means the rather external and the fully external truths of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'camels' as general facts belonging to the natural man, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a> - general facts being lower or rather external truths of good; and from the meaning of 'asses' as still lower or fully external truths of natural good, dealt with in <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. What interior 
goods and truths are, also what intermediate ones are, as well as what the rather external and the fully external are, may be seen from what has been stated in <a href="4009.htm">4009</a>. With man three general areas exist 
- the bodily, the natural, and the rational. The bodily is outermost, the natural is intermediate, and the rational is interior. Insofar as one of these reigns over another in someone he is called 
either bodily-minded, or natural, or rational. These three parts of man's mind intercommunicate in a wonderful way - the bodily part with the natural, and the natural with the rational. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When a 
person is first born only the immature bodily part exists; but this has within it the capacity to become fully developed. Subsequently he becomes natural, and at length rational. From this one may see 
that communication takes place between one part and another. The bodily part communicates with the natural by means of the senses, doing so through the senses belonging to the understanding in a distinct 
and separate way from its communication through those belonging to the will; for both understanding and will have to become fully developed in a person if he is to become and is to be fully human. 
The perceptions of the senses of sight and hearing serve in particular to develop fully his understanding, while the other three senses have regard in particular to his will. The bodily part of man's 
mind communicates with his natural - which, as has been stated, is the intermediate part - by means of the senses. For the things that enter through sensory experience accommodate themselves within 
the natural as a kind of receptacle for them. This receptacle is the memory. The delight, pleasure, and desire there belong to the will and are called natural goods, but the facts there belong to the 
understanding and are called natural truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 By means of these things just mentioned the natural part of man's mind communicates with his rational which, as has been stated, is the interior part. 
The things which rise up from the natural to the rational accommodate themselves in the rational likewise as in a kind of receptacle. This receptacle is the interior memory, dealt with in <a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2480.htm">2480</a>. 
The blessing and happiness there belong to the will and are forms of rational good, while the interior insights into things, and the perceptions of these, belong to the understanding, the objects of 
those insights and perceptions being called rational truths. These three - the bodily, the natural, and the rational - are what constitute a human being. Means of communication exist between these three, 
the external senses being the means by which the bodily part of a person's mind communicates with his natural, and the interior senses those by which the natural part of his mind communicates with 
his rational. Therefore it is those things which are present in the natural part of a person's mind, and which have been derived from the external senses that belong properly to the body, that are called 
the rather external and the fully external truths of good. But those which have been derived from the interior senses, which belong properly to his spirit and communicate with the rational, are 
the ones which are called interior goods and truths. And those which come in between and partake of both are the ones which are called intermediate goods and truths. These three groups of truths, starting 
in order with interior, are what are meant in the internal sense by 'flocks', by 'servant-girls and slaves', and by 'camels and asses'. </p>

`Et cameli et asini': quod significet vera boni exteriora et externa, constat ex significatione `camelorum' quod sint scientifica communia naturalis hominis, de qua n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145; scientifica 
communia sunt vera boni inferiora seu exteriora; </p>
<p>et ex significatione `asinorum' quod sint vera boni naturalis adhuc inferiora seu externa, de qua n. 2781.  Quid bona et vera interiora, tum 
media, ut et exteriora et externa, constare potest ab illis quae n. 4009 dicta sunt.  Apud hominem sunt tria in communi, nempe corporeum, naturale, et rationale; corporeum est extimum, naturale est 
medium, rationale est interius; quantum apud hominem regnat unum prae altero, tantum dicitur vel corporeus, vel naturalis, vel rationalis; hae tres partes hominis mirabiliter communicant, nempe 
corporeum cum naturali, et naturale cum rationali; [2] homo cum primum nascitur, est mere corporeus, sed facultas inest ut perfici possit, postea fit naturalis, tandem rationalis; inde quod communicatio 
unius cum altero sit, constare potest; corporeum cum naturali communicat per sensualia, et hoc distincte per illa quae pertinent ad intellectum et quae pertinent ad voluntatem; nam utrumque perficiendum 
est apud hominem ut fiat et sit homo; sensualia visus et auditus imprimis sunt quae perficiunt facultatem ejus intellectualem, tria reliqua sensualia spectant imprimis voluntatem; corporeum 
hominis per sensualia illa communicat cum naturali ejus, quod est pars media, ut dictum; quae enim intrant per sensualia, se reponunt in naturali sicut in quodam receptaculo; hoc receptaculum 
est memoria; jucundum ibi, volupe, et cupidum pertinent ad voluntatem, et vocantur bona naturalia, at scientifica ibi ad intellectum et vocantur vera naturalia; [3] naturale hominis per haec quae nunc 
dicta sunt, communicat cum rationali ejus, quod est pars interior, ut dictum; quae se elevant inde versus rationale, ea se reponunt in rationali etiam sicut in quodam receptaculo; hoc receptaculum 
est memoria interior, de qua n. 2469-2480; beatum ibi et felix pertinent ad voluntatem, et sunt boni rationalis, ac intuitiones interiores rerum et perceptiones pertinent ad intellectum, et quae 
{1}harum sunt, vocantur vera rationalia; haec tria sunt quae constituunt hominem; inter illa tria dantur communicationes, sensualia externa sunt per quae corporeum hominis communicat cum naturali 
ejus, et sensualia interiora sunt per quae naturale hominis communicat cum rationali ejus; quae itaque in naturali hominis trahunt ex sensualibus externis, quae sunt propria corporis, sunt quae vocantur 
vera boni exteriora et externa; quae autem ex sensualibus internis, quae sunt propria ejus spiritus et communicant cum rationali, sunt quae vocantur bona et vera interiora; quae inter illa sunt, 
et participant de utroque sunt quae vocantur bona et vera media; haec tria sunt in ordine ab interioribus, quae significantur in sensu interno per `greges,' per `ancillas et servos,' et per `camelos 
et asinos.' </p>
