<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>868.</strong>“直到水在地上都干了”表虚假明显消散。这一点从正在重生之人的状态清楚可知。如今，人皆以为人在重生时，他里面的邪恶与虚假会彻底被驱离和消灭，以致他重生之后，不再有任何邪恶或虚假，因此他是洁净和公义的，就象人被水洗干净了一样。但这种想法完全是错误的。因为没有一个邪恶，也没有一个虚假能被驱散到被消灭的程度。相反，自婴儿时通过遗传固定在他里面的一切，以及他通过自己的行为所获取的一切，都会保留下来。因此，即便已经重生，一个人仍无非是邪恶与虚假，如死后所充分证明给灵魂的。由此充分表明，除了来自主的事物外，人里面根本没有任何良善与真理可言，人的一切邪恶与虚假皆源于自我中心，并且世人，精灵，甚至天使，即便在最小程度上交由他自己，也会自己冲向地狱。故经上说“天也不洁净”（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯15.15.htm">15:15</a>）。天使承认这一点，凡不承认的，无法在天使之列。唯独主的仁慈给予他们自由，甚至将其带出地狱，使他们从中退离，以免他们任由自己冲向那里。他们被主保守，以免冲向地狱，对此，天使有明显的感知，甚至善灵也有某种程度的感知。然而，恶灵和世人一样，并不相信这一点，哪怕多次向他们显明。蒙主慈悲，这一事实会在后面通过经历予以描述。<br />因此，人的状态乃是这样：没有任何邪恶或虚假能被驱散到被消灭的程度。因为适合他的生命就在于恶和假，主在重生人期间，会以其神圣的慈悲通过试探制服人的恶与假，以致它们看似死去。然而它们并没有死，只是被制服了，以使它们无法和源于主的善与真对抗。同时，主还通过试探赋予他接受良善与真理的新能力。祂做到这一点，是通过赐予他对恶与假所折向的善与真的观念和情感，还通过将细节注入到他的笼统概念（如前所述）中，将细微之处注入到这类细节中，它们被储存在人内，他对其毫不知情，因为相对于他的领悟和感知范围来说，它们更为内在。这些事物的性质是这样：它们能充当容器或器皿，以便主能将仁爱注入到它们里面，将纯真注入到仁爱里面。通过这些事物在世人、精灵或天使身上的奇妙组合，一种彩虹就会呈现出来，彩虹由此成为“立约的记号”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.12.htm">9:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.16.htm">16</a>），对此，蒙主慈悲，我们将在那一章予以解释。当人被如此形成时，就说他重生了。他的一切恶与假仍旧保留，然而同时他的一切真与善也会被保存。对恶人而言，他的所有恶与假，和他在肉身生活时所拥有的一模一样，它们会在来生重现，并转化为地狱的幻觉和惩罚。而对善人而言，他所有善与真的状态，诸如友谊、仁爱、纯真，连同其喜悦和快乐的状态，会在来生被唤起，并无限地繁殖增多。这些事物就是“水都干了”，即虚假明显消散所表示的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]868.</strong> The symbolism of till the water dried up on the earth as apparently getting rid of falsity can be seen from the circumstances a person faces when being reborn.<br />Everyone today believes that the evil and falsity we have in us is wholly dispelled and abolished when we regenerate, so that when our rebirth is complete, nothing evil or false remains. People suppose we are then pure and righteous, as if we had been washed and rinsed with water. But this belief is absolutely false. Not a single evil or falsity is so thoroughly dispelled as to be abolished. Everything we inherited at infancy and everything we acquired through our actions remains, so that even when we have become regenerate we consist of unrelieved evil and falsity. Souls after death go through experiences that demonstrate this fact to them.<br />The same thing is also clear enough from the consideration that we have no goodness or truth whatever except from the Lord and that all our vices and distortions come from our selfhood. If people — or spirits, or even angels — were left on their own for even the smallest moment, they would make a spontaneous rush for hell. For this reason the Word says that heaven is not pure [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/bible_king-james-version_job_15_15" target=_top>Job 15:15</a>]. The angels acknowledge this, and no one who fails to acknowledge it can be among them. The Lord's mercy alone frees them from hell, indeed removes them from hell and keeps them from voluntarily plunging right back in.<br />Angels perceive plainly that the Lord keeps them from running headlong into hell. Good spirits do too, up to a point. But evil spirits, like people on earth, do not believe it, although they have been shown many times. A description of my experiences on this subject will appear below, by the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} [2] The human condition, then, is such that we can never banish anything evil or false so completely as to eliminate it, since evil and falsity make up those aspects of life that are all our own. Because of this, when the Lord uses times of trouble to regenerate us, in his divine mercy he subdues our evil and falsity to the point where they look dead, although they are not; they are merely so well conquered that they cannot stand up to the goodness and truth the Lord gives us.<br />Through our times of trouble the Lord also gives us a new capacity for receiving goodness and truth. He endows us with conceptions of what is good and true, and feelings of affection for it, and whatever is evil and false can then be bent in that direction. He also introduces into our general ideas (as described above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_848#subsection-2-3" target=_top>848:3</a>]) more specific ones, and into these the most specific, which are hidden to us and of which we are totally unaware, since they lie beyond the reach of our comprehension and perception. This subconscious knowledge serves as a reservoir or container into which the Lord can pour neighborly love, which itself holds the innocence he can instill.<br />These things, when mixed together in marvelous balance in a person, spirit, or angel, can present an image of a rainbow, which is why a rainbow was used as the sign of the pact mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_12-13" target=_top>Genesis 9:12-13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_16" target=_top>16</a>. For more on this, with the Lord's divine mercy, see there [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036" target=_top>1036-1056</a>].<br />When we have come into this form, we are called regenerate. Everything evil and false in us remains, but then everything good and true is also preserved. Bad people find that all the forms of evil and falsity they had indulged in during bodily life return in exactly the same form in the next life, where they turn into the hallucinations and punishments of hell. Good people in the next life, though, recall all the states marked by goodness and truth that they had experienced — states of friendship, love for others, and innocence — along with the attendant joys and pleasures, now increased and multiplied beyond measure.<br />This, then, is the apparent eradication of falsity symbolized by the drying up of the water.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Although Swedenborg touches on the topic of the Lord as the sole restraint that keeps us from plunging ourselves into the hells in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5854#subsection-2-2" target=_top>5854:2</a>, the experiential material that he is referring to here is probably to be seen in the extended discussion of human freedom in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2870" target=_top>2870-2893</a>.

Until the waters were dried up from off the earth. That this signifies the apparent dissipation of falsities, is evident from the state of man when he is being regenerated. Everyone believes at the present 
day that the evils and falsities in man are entirely separated and abolished during regeneration, so that when he becomes regenerate, nothing of evil or falsity remains, but he is clean and righteous, 
like one washed and purified with water. This notion is, however, utterly false; for not a single evil or falsity can be so shaken off as to be abolished; but whatever has been hereditarily derived 
from infancy, and acquired by act and deed, remains; so that man, notwithstanding his being regenerate, is nothing but evil and falsity, as is shown to the life to souls after death. The truth of 
this may be sufficiently manifest from the consideration, that there is nothing of good and nothing of truth in man except from the Lord, and that all evil and falsity are man's from his Own; and that 
man, and spirit, and even angel, if left in the least to himself, would rush of himself into hell; wherefore also it is said in the Word that heaven is not pure. This is acknowledged by angels, and 
he who does not acknowledge it cannot be among angels. It is the Lord's mercy alone that liberates them, and even draws them out of hell and keeps them from rushing thither of themselves. That they are 
kept by the Lord from rushing into hell, is manifestly perceived by the angels, and even in a measure by good spirits. Evil spirits, however, like men, do not believe this; but it has often been shown 
them, as of the Lord's Divine mercy will be told from experience hereafter.  [2] Since therefore the state of man is such that no evil and falsity can ever be so shaken off as to be abolished, because 
the life that is proper to him consists in evil and falsity, the Lord, from Divine mercy, while He regenerates man, through temptations so subdues his evils and falsities that they appear as if 
dead, though they are not dead, but are only subdued so that they cannot fight against the goods and truths which are from the Lord. At the same time also the Lord through temptations gives man a new 
faculty of receiving goods and truths, by gifting him with ideas and affections of good and of truth, to which evils and falsities can be bent, and by inserting in his generals (of which above) particulars, 
and in these singulars, which are stored up in man and which he knows nothing about, for they are interior to the sphere of his apprehension and perception. These are of a nature to serve for receptacles 
or vessels, so that charity can be insinuated into them by the Lord, and into charity innocence. By their wonderful tempering with man, spirit, and angel, a kind of rainbow may be represented, 
and for this reason the rainbow was made the sign of the covenant (Gen. 9:12-17), concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall speak under that chapter. When man has been thus formed, he 
is said to be regenerate, all his evils and falsities still remaining, yet at the same time all his goods and truths being preserved. With an evil man all his evils and falsities, just as he had them 
in the life of the body, return in the other life and are turned into infernal phantasies and punishments. But with a good man, all his states of good and truth, such as those of friendship, of charity, 
and of innocence, are recalled in the other life, and together with their delights and happinesses, are there immensely augmented and multiplied. These things then are what is signified by the drying 
of the waters, which is the apparent dissipation of falsities. </p>

'Until the waters dried up from over the earth' means the apparent dispersal of falsities. This is clear from a person's state when he is being regenerated. Nowadays everyone imagines that evils and 
falsities with a person are totally dispersed and done away with when he is being regenerated, so that when he has been regenerated no evil or falsity is left, and he is therefore clean and righteous, 
like someone washed and made clean with water. But this is completely false. Not a single evil nor a single falsity is ever dispersed so as to be done away with. Instead everything fixed in him by heredity 
since infancy and everything he has acquired through his own actions remains. As a consequence, even though he has been regenerated a person is still nothing but evil and falsity, as is forcibly 
demonstrated to souls after death. From this it also becomes quite clear that no one has any good or any truth at all unless it derives from the Lord, and that all a person's evil and falsity derive 
from the proprium, and that man, a spirit too, and even an angel, if left in the smallest degree to himself, of himself rushes headlong towards hell. This also is why in the Word it is said that heaven 
is not pure.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> This the angels acknowledge, and anyone who does not do so cannot be among them. It is the Lord's mercy alone which gives them freedom, indeed it raises them up from hell, and withholds 
them from it and from rushing back there if left to themselves. The fact that they are withheld by the Lord to prevent them rushing into hell, angels perceive clearly, as also do good spirits to a 
limited extent. Evil spirits however, like men, do not believe this, even though they have been shown it many times, as in the Lord's Divine mercy will be described from experience further on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Man's state therefore being such that no evil or falsity can possibly be so dispersed as to be done away with, because the life which is his own consists in evil and falsity, the Lord in His Divine mercy 
so subdues a person's evils and falsities by means of temptations while He is regenerating him that they do seem to be dead. They are not dead however, only subdued so that they are unable to fight 
against the goods and truths that have been derived from the Lord. At that time by means of temptations the Lord also gives him a new ability to receive goods and truths. He does so by granting him 
ideas of and affections for good and truth towards which evils and falsities can be turned, and by instilling into his general concepts of things - dealt with already - the details and the finer points 
to such details, which have been stored away in the individual and of which he knows nothing at all, since they are interior to the sphere of his comprehension and perception. The nature of these things 
is such that they are able to serve as receptacles or vessels, so that charity can be instilled in them by the Lord, and innocence in charity. Through the remarkable combination of these things with 
a man, spirit, or angel, a kind of rainbow can be represented, and this is why the rainbow became a sign of the covenant, see Chapter 9:12-16, to be dealt with, in the Lord's Divine mercy, when those 
verses are explained. When a person has been so formed he is said to be regenerated. All his evils and falsities still remain, as also do all his truths and goods that have been preserved. In the 
case of an evil person, all his evils and falsities, exactly as these existed with him during his lifetime, reappear in the next life and are converted into delusions and hellish punishments. But in the 
case of a good person, all his states of good and truth, such as those of friendship, charity, and innocence, together with their joys and delights - now increased and multiplied immensely - are recalled 
in the next life. These are the things meant by 'the waters drying up', namely the apparent dispersal of falsities.

'Usque ad exsiccationem aquarum [de] super terra': quod significent dissipationem apparentem falsitatum, constat ex statu hominis cum regeneratur: 'hodie nullus non credit quod mala et falsa apud hominem 
prorsus discutiantur et aboleantur cum regeneratur, sic ut cum regeneratus est nihil mali et falsi remaneat, ita ut mundus sit et justus, sicut abstersus et ablutus aquis; sed hoc est falsissimum; 
nusquam unicum malum aut unicum falsum discutitur ita ut aboleatur, sed omne quodcumque ab infantia hereditario imbuit et actualitate acquisivit, remanet, sic ut homo, tametsi regeneratus est, non 
sit nisi malum et falsum, quod animabus post mortem ad vivum ostenditur; quod etiam inde satis manifeste constare potest quod nihil boni et nihil veri sit homini nisi a Domino, et quod omne malum et falsum 
homini a proprio, et quod homo, ut et spiritus, immo angelus, si vel minime relinquitur sibi, ruat ex se ad infernum; quare etiam in Verbo dicitur quod caelum {1} non sit purum; hoc angeli agnoscunt, 
et qui non agnoscit, is inter angelos non esse potest; est sola Domini Misericordia quae liberat eos, immo quae extrahit eos et detinet ab inferno ne illuc ex semet ruant; quod detineantur a Domino 
ne ruant in infernum, manifeste percipiunt angeli, quodammodo etiam spiritus boni; spiritus autem mali, sicut homines, hoc non credunt, sed iis multoties ostensum est; de quibus ab experientia, ex 
Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur in sequentibus. [2] Cum itaque status hominis talis est quod nusquam aliquod malum et falsum ita discuti possit ut aboleatur, quia in malo et falso consistit ejus 
vita propria, Dominus, ex Divina Misericordia, dum regenerat hominem, per tentationes mala ejus et falsa ita domat ut quasi mortua appareant; tametsi non mortua sunt, solum domata ne repugnare possint 
ita bonis et veris quae a Domino; tum quoque Dominus per tentationes novam facultatem dat recipiendi bona et vera, donando hominem ideis et affectionibus boni et veri ad quae mala et falsa possint flecti; 
et insinuando communibus ejus, de quibus prius, particularia, et his singularia, quae apud hominem recondita sunt et quae homo prorsus nescit, nam intra ejus captus et perceptionis sphaeram sunt; 
quae talia sunt ut pro receptaculis seu vasis inservire possint, ut iis a Domino insinuari queat charitas, et huic innocentia; per quorum mirabilem temperaturam apud hominem, spiritum et angelum, iridis 
species repraesentari potest, quare iris signum foederis facta est, cap. ix 12-16; de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ibi. Cum ita formatus est homo, tunc dicitur regeneratus, remanentibus usque 
omnibus ejus malis et falsis, tum etiam conservatis omnibus ejus bonis et veris; qui malus est, ejus omnia mala et falsa, prorsus sicut fuit in illis in vita corporis, in altera vita redeunt et vertuntur 
in phantasias et poenas infernales; qui autem bonus, omnes ejus status boni et veri, ut amicitiae, charitatis, et innocentiae, cum illorum jucundis et felicibus, immensum auctis et multiplicatis, 
in altera vita revocantur. Haec nunc sunt quae significantur per 'exsiccationem aquarum,' quae est dissipatio apparens falsitatum. 	@1 This seems to be from Job. xv 15; which S. learnt was not a
