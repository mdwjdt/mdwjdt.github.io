<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4786.</strong>“约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭”表内在的哀恸。这从“哀哭”的含义清楚可知，“哀哭”是指极度悲伤和痛苦，因而是指内在的哀恸。在古代教会，藉以表现内在事物的外在行为包括为死者哀号和哭泣，以此表示内在的哀恸，尽管哀恸本身不是内在的。例如，我们所读有关与约瑟一同去埋葬雅各的埃及人的经文：<br />他们到了约旦河外、亚达的禾场，就在那里大大地号啕痛哭。约瑟为他父亲哀哭了七天。那地的居民迦南人见亚达禾场上的哀哭，就说，这是埃及人一场极大的哀哭。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.10.htm">50:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.11.htm">11</a>）<br />还有关于大卫为押尼珥哭泣：<br />他们将押尼珥葬在希伯仑。王在押尼珥的墓旁放声而哭，众民也都哭了。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.32.htm">3:32</a>）</p>

And his father wept for him. That this signifies interior mourning, is evident from the signification of "weeping," as being grief and sadness to the last degree, thus interior mourning. Among the externals 
by which internals were represented in the ancient churches was wailing and weeping over the dead, by which was signified interior mourning (although the mourning itself was not interior), as 
we read concerning the Egyptians who went with Joseph to bury Jacob: </p>
<p>     When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is in the passage of Jordan, they wailed there with a very great and sore 
wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. And the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians 
(Gen. 1:10-11); </p>
<p>and concerning David's weeping over Abner: </p>
<p>     They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept (2 Sam. 3:32). </p>

'And his father wept for him' means interior mourning. This is clear from the meaning of 'weeping' as the extremity of grief and sadness, and so as interior mourning. In the ancient Churches the external 
practices by which, internal things were represented included those of wailing and weeping over the dead. Their wailing and weeping meant interior mourning, although their actual mourning was not 
interior. One reads the following, for example, about the Egyptians who had set out with Joseph to bury Jacob, </p>
<blockquote>
When they came to the threshing-floor of Atad which is at the crossing of the Jordan 
they wailed there with an exceedingly great and grievous wailing, and he mourned for his father seven days. And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of 
Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2050:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 50:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And one reads about David weeping over Abner, </p>
<blockquote>
They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king lifted up his voice and 
wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%203:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 3:32</a>.

`Et flevit eum pater ejus': quod significet luctum interiorem, constat ex significatione `flere' quod sit ultimum doloris et tristitiae, ita luctus interior; inter externa per quae repraesentabantur 
interna, in Ecclesiis antiquis etiam fuit planctus et fletus super mortuos, quibus significabatur luctus interior tametsi non interior fuit; sicut legitur de Aegyptiis qui cum Josepho profecti 
sunt ad sepeliendum Jacobum (o)de quo ita,           Cum venerunt ad aream Atad {2}, quae in transitu      Jordanis, planxerunt ibi planctum magnum et gravem valde, et      fecit {1} patri suo luctum 
septem dies: et vidit habitator      terrae Cananaeus luctum in area Atad {2}, et dixerunt, Luctus      hic est gravis Aegyptiis, Gen. l 10, 11 et de Davide super Abnerum,           Sepeliverunt 
Abnerum in Hebrone, et sustulit rex vocem      suam ac flevit apud sepulcrum Abneri, et fleverunt omnis      populus 2 Sam. iii 32.      @1 fecitque$      @2 Arad AI$ </p>
