<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3312节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3312.</strong>“住在帐棚里”表由此产生的敬拜。这从“帐棚”的含义清楚可知，“帐棚”是指爱的神圣，以及由此产生的敬拜的神圣（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>节）。“帐棚”表敬拜的神圣，这是因为在上古时代，具有对主之爱，因而具有神圣敬拜的教会中人住在帐棚中，并在里面举行神圣敬拜。由于那时爱的神圣，以及由此产生的敬拜的神圣开始由帐棚来代表，故他们被吩咐照着在西乃山上指示给摩西的样式支搭帐棚，并在里面设立其神性敬拜。这也是住棚节的起源，那时他们住在帐棚中是为了代表属天教会成员所具有的神圣敬拜。由此明显可知“住在帐棚里”表示敬拜。</p>

Dwelling in tents. That this signifies the derivative worship, is evident from the signification of "tents," as being the holy of love, and thence of worship (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152). That "tents" 
signify the holy of worship, is because in the most ancient time the man of the church who was in love to the Lord and thence in holy worship, dwelt in tents, and there performed his holy worship; and 
because at that time the holy of love and thence the holy of worship began to be represented by tents, it was commanded that they should make a Tent according to the pattern shown to Moses upon Mount 
Sinai, and should therein institute their Divine worship. Hence also the feast of tabernacles, and their then dwelling in tents, was for the sake of the representation of the holy worship which belonged 
to the man of the celestial church; and this shows that by "dwelling in tents" is signified worship. </p>

'Dwelling in tents' means worship arising out of this. This is clear from the meaning of 'tents' as the holiness of love and of the worship arising out of this, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>. The reason 'tents' 
means the holiness of the worship arising is that in most ancient times the member of the Church with whom love to the Lord and consequently holy worship existed dwelt in tents and held his holy worship 
there. And because the holiness of love and the resulting holiness of worship started to be represented at that period by means of tents, they were commanded to make a Tent according to the pattern 
shown to Moses on Mount Sinai and to establish their Divine worship there. This was also the origin of the Feast of Tabernacles when they had to dwell in tents, which they were required to do so 
as to represent the holy worship which existed with the member of the celestial Church. From this it is evident that 'dwelling in tents' means worship. </p>

`Habitans tentoria': quod significet cultum inde, constat ex significatione `tentoriorum' quod sint sanctum amoris et inde cultus, n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152; quod tentoria significent sanctum cultus 
inde est {1}quia antiquissimo tempore homo Ecclesiae qui in amore in Dominum fuit et inde in sancto cultu, in tentoriis {2}habitavit, et ibi suum cultum sanctum {3}habuit: et quia tunc repraesentari {4}coeptum 
sanctum amoris et inde sanctum cultus per tentoria, mandatum fuit ut Tentorium, secundum typum {5}ostensum Mosi in monte Sinai, facerent, et ibi cultum suum Divinum instituerent; exinde etiam 
festum tabernaculorum et quod tunc habitarent tentoria, erat ex causa repraesentationis sancti cultus qui fuit Ecclesiae caelestis homini; exinde patet quod per `habitare tentoria' significetur cultus. @1
