<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5030.</strong>创世记39:19，20.于是，约瑟的主听见他妻子向他讲述的话说，你的仆人照这些话待我；他的怒气就发作了。约瑟的主拿住他，把他下在监牢里，就是王的囚犯被囚的地方。于是约瑟在那里坐牢。<br />“于是”表一个新状态。“约瑟的主听见他妻子向他讲述的话”表看似真理的虚假的交流。“说，你的仆人照这些话待我”表确认。“他的怒气就发作了”表对属灵真理的憎恶。“约瑟的主拿住他”表来自属世层的试探。“把他下在监牢里”表涉及反对良善的谎言。“就是王的囚犯被囚的地方”表那些陷入虚假的人所处的状态。“于是约瑟在那里坐牢”表试探持续的时间。</p>

Verses 19, 20. And it came to pass when his lord heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, According to these words did thy servant to me; that his anger was kindled. And Joseph's 
lord took him, and put him into the prison house, the place where the king's bound ones were bound; and he was there in the prison house. "And it came to pass," signifies a new state; "when his lord 
heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him," signifies communication of falsity which appeared as truth; "saying, According to these words did thy servant to me," signifies confirmation; "that 
his anger was kindled," signifies aversion to spiritual truth. "And Joseph's lord took him," signifies temptation from the natural; "and put him into the prison house," signifies as to false-speaking 
against good; "the place where the king's bound ones were bound," signifies the state in which those are who are in falsities; "and he was there in the prison house," signifies the duration of the 
temptation. </p>

him to the prison-house, a place where the king's bound ones were bound; and he was there in the prison-house. </p>
<p>'And it happened' means a new state. 'As his lord heard his wife's words which she 
spoke to him' means the communication of falsity which looked like the truth. 'Saying, This is what your slave did to me means corroboration. 'That his anger flared up' means an aversion to spiritual 
truth. 'And Joseph's lord took him' means temptation coming from the natural. 'And committed him to the prison-house' means involving false-speaking against good. 'A place where the king's bound ones 
were bound' means the state of those governed by falsities. 'And he was there in the prison-house' means the duration of that temptation.
