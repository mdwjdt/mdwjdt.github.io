<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5363节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5363.</strong>“惟独埃及全地有粮食”表增多的源于良善的真理之余剩。这从以下事实清楚可知：“埃及全地的粮食”是指七个丰年内聚敛起来并存放在各城的五谷。如前面频繁所阐述和说明的，这些粮食表示储存在属世心智内层中的余剩。因此，“埃及全地的粮食”表示增多的源于良善的真理之余剩。“埃及地的粮食”在此表示余剩，这一点从以下事实也明显可知：荒年已经开始了，在这荒年里，埃及地和其它地一样遭受饥荒，只是它储存了五谷，而其它地则没有储存；因此，接下来是这句话“埃及全地有了饥荒”。</p>

But in all the land of Egypt there was bread. That this signifies remains in consequence of truths from good having been multiplied, is evident from the fact that by the "bread in all the land of Egypt" 
is meant the corn gathered in the seven years of abundance of produce, and laid up in the cities, by which are signified the remains stored up in the interiors of the natural mind, as has frequently 
been stated and shown above. Hence by the "bread in all the land of Egypt" are signified the remains in consequence of truths from good having been multiplied. That remains are here meant by the "bread 
in the land of Egypt," is evident also from the fact that the years of famine had already begun, in which the land of Egypt suffered famine equally with the other lands, except that it had stores 
laid up which the other lands had not, and therefore these words now follow, "and all the land of Egypt was famished." </p>

'And in all the land of Egypt there was bread' means the remnants of the truths from good that have been multiplied. This is clear from the fact that 'bread in all the land of Egypt' is used to mean 
the grain which was gathered together in the seven years of abundance of corn and stored in the cities. This grain, as stated and shown in various places above, means the remnants stored away in the interior 
parts of the natural mind, and therefore 'bread in all the land of Egypt' means the remnants of the truths from good that have been multiplied. That remnants are meant here by 'bread in the land 
of Egypt' is in addition evident from the fact that the years of famine had already begun, years in which the land of Egypt suffered just as much as the rest of the earth did (except that it had grain 
laid aside, whereas the rest of the world did not), on account of which the statement 'And all the land of Egypt suffered famine' immediately follows. </p>

`Et in omni terra Aegypti fuit panis': quod significet reliquias ex multiplicatis veris ex bono, constat ex eo quod per `panem in omni terra Aegypti' intelligatur frumentum in septem annis abundantiae 
annonae collectum et in urbibus repositum, per quod quod significatae sint reliquiae in interioribus mentis {1}naturalis reconditae, supra passim dictum et ostensum est, inde per `panem in omni terra 
Aegypti' significantur reliquiae ex multiplicatis veris ex bono; quod reliquiae hic sint `panis in terra Aegypti', patet quoque ex eo quod {2}jamdum inceperint anni famis, {3}in quibus terra Aegypti 
aeque passa famem ac reliquae terrae, praeter quod haberet deposita {4}quae reliquae terrae non haberent, quare etiam nunc sequitur `Et famem passa omnis terra Aegypti'.  @1 naturalibus$ @2 nunc$ @3 
et quam passa terra Aegypti aeque$ @4 prae reliquis$ </p>
