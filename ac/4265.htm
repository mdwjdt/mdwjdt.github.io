Verses 16-23. And he gave into the hand of his servants each drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove. And he commanded the first, saying, 
When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? Then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's; this is a present sent 
unto my lord Esau; and behold he is behind us. And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that went after the droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find 
him. And ye shall also say, Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us; for he said, I will expiate his faces in a present that goeth before me, and afterwards I will see his faces; peradventure he will 
lift up my faces. And the present passed over before him, and he passed the night in that night in the camp. And he rose up in that night, and he took his two women, and his two handmaids, and his eleven 
sons, and passed over the passage of Jabbok. And he took them, and caused them to pass the river, and caused to pass what he had. "And he gave into the hand of his servants each drove by itself; 
and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove," signifies an orderly arrangement in regard to the way in which they were to be initiated; "and he commanded 
the first, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? Then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's; this is 
a present sent unto my lord Esau; and behold he also is behind us," signifies submission; "and he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that went after the droves, saying, According to this 
word shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him," signifies a continuation; "and ye shall also say, Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us; for he said, I will expiate his faces in a present that goeth 
before me, and afterward I will see his faces; peradventure he will lift up my faces," signifies preparation for what follows; "and the present passed over before him," signifies the effect; "and 
he passed the night in that night in the camp," signifies the things which follow; "and he rose up in that night, and took his two women, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the 
passage of Jabbok," signifies the first instilling of the affections of truth together with the truths acquired; "the passage of Jabbok" is the first instilling; "and he took them, and caused them 
to pass the river, and caused to pass what he had," signifies further instilling. </p>

Verses 16-23 And he gave them into the hand of his servants, drove by drove separately; and he said to his servants, Pass over in front of me and put a space between drove and drove. And he commanded 
the first, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong, and where are you going; and whose are these in front of you? then you shall say, They belong to your servant 
Jacob; it is a gift sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us. And he commanded the second also, the third also, and all also following the droves, saying, In this manner<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> shall you 
speak to Esau when you find him. And you shall also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the gift that is going in front of me, and after that I will see 
his face; perhaps he will accept me. And the gift passed over in front of him, and he spent that night in the camp. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives (femina), and his two servant-girls, 
and his eleven sons, and passed over at the passage of Jabbok. And he took them and made them pass over the river, and made all that he had pass over. </p>
<p>'He gave them into the hand of his servants, 
drove by drove separately, and he said to his servants, Pass over in front of me and put a space between drove and drove' means an arrangement of them into the order in which they were to be introduced. 
'And he commanded the first, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong; and where are you going; and whose are these in front of you? then you shall say, 
They belong to your servant Jacob; it is a gift sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us' means submission. 'And he commanded the second also, the third also, and all also following the 
droves, saying, In this manner shall you speak to Esau when you find him' means a continuation. 'And you shall also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with 
the gift that is going in front of me, and after that I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me' means preparation for what follows. 'And the gift passed over in front of him' means being carried 
into effect. 'And he spent that night in the camp' means the things which follow. 'And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servant-girls, and his eleven sons, and passed over at 
the passage of Jabbok' means the first instillation of the affections for truth, together with truths that had been acquired, 'the passage of Jabbok' meaning the first instillation. 'And he took them 
and made them pass over the river, and made all that he had pass over' means a further instillation.

Vers. 16-23. Et dedit in manum servorum suorum catervam catervam seorsim; et dixit ad servos suos, Transite ante me et spatium ponatis inter catervam et inter catervam.  Et praecepit primo dicendo, 
Quod occurrerit tibi Esau frater meus, et interrogaverit dicendo, Cui tu, et quo vadis, et cui illa ante te?  Et dices, Servo te Jacobo, munus hoc missum domino meo Esavo; et ecce etiam is post nos. 
 Et praecepit etiam secundo, etiam tertio, etiam omnibus euntibus post catervas, dicendo, Secundum verbum hoc loquemini ad Esavum, inveniendo vos eum.  Et dicetis etiam, Ecce servus tuus Jacob 
post nos; quia dixit, Expiabo facies ejus in munere eunte ante me, et postea vide facies ejus, forte suscipiet facies meas.  Et transivit munus ante eum, et is pernoctavit in nocte illa in castris. 
 Et surrexit in nocte illa, et accepit binas feminas suas, et binas ancillas suas, et undecim natos suos, transivit transitum Jabbok. Et accepit illos, et transire fecit illos fluvium, et transire 
fecit quae sibi {1}. `Dedit in manum servorum suorum catervam catervam seorsim, et dixit ad servos suos, Transite ante me, et spatium ponatis inter catervam' significat ordinationem quomodo initiarentur: 
`et praecepit primo, dicendo, Quod occurrerit tibi Esau frater meus, et interrogaverit te, dicendo, Cui tu, et quo vadis, et cui illa ante te? et dices, Servo tuo Jacobo, munus hoc missum domino 
meo Esavo, et ecce etiam is post nos' significat submissionem: et praecepit etiam secundo, etiam tertio, etiam omnibus euntibus post catervas, dicendo, Secundum verbum hoc loquemini ad Esavum 
in inveniendo vos eum' significat continuum: `et dicetis etiam, Ecce servus tuus Jacob post nos; quia dixit, Expiabo facies ejus, [in munere eunte ante me, et postea videbo facies ejus,] forte suscipiet 
facies meas' significat praeparationem ad sequentia: `et transivit munus ante eum' significat effectum: `et is pernoctavit in nocte illa in castris' significat quae sequuntur: `et surrexit in 
nocte illa, et accepit binas feminas suas, et binas ancillas suas, et undecim natos suos, et transivit transitum Jabbok' significat insinuationem primam affectionum veri cum veris acquisitis; `transitus 
Jabbok' est insinuatio prima: `et accepit illos, et transire fecit illos fluvium, et transire fecit quae sibi' significat ulteriorem insinuationem.      @1 A has in margin (Specialia non explicari
