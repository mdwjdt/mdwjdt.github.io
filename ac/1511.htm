<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1511节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1511.</strong>我通过大量经历得知，并且清楚到再没有比这更清楚的是：沉浸在虚假中的灵人会流入别人的思维，引发一种强烈的说服，使得虚假完全就象真理，以致无论怎么看，这种虚假只可能是真理；他们通过自己的气场做到这一点。沉浸在邪恶中的恶魔也一样，他们以类似方式流入意愿，使邪恶完全就象良善，以致无论怎样感知，这种邪恶只可能是良善；他们也是通过自己的气场做到的。我得以清楚察觉灵人或恶魔上千次的流注、它来自谁，以及天使如何通过主除去这些影响，除此以外还有很多无法轻易详细描述的其它事。我由此清楚知道，而且无比确定人所具有的虚假和邪恶源自哪里；还有，诸如肉体死后保留下来，并清晰显明自身的那类气场就来自谬念和恶欲。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1511.</strong> Much experience has taught me to recognize 钬?and to recognize as clearly as I recognize anything 钬?that spirits who are caught up in falsity influence our thinking and thoroughly convince us that falsity is true. We cannot see it any other way, and this results from their aura.<br />Demons too, who are immersed in evil, influence our will in this way and cause evil to seem utterly good. We cannot feel it any other way, and this again results from their aura.<br />I have had a thousand opportunities to perceive clearly the influence of each group, to tell who it came from, how angels working for the Lord removed the effects, and many other details besides, which cannot well be listed individually.<br />From this I could see two things with such certainty that nothing has ever seemed more certain to me. One is where the falsity and evil in us come from. The other is the fact that false assumptions and the desire for evil give rise to these auras that stay with us after physical life has ended and that display themselves so openly. </p>

It has been made known to me by much experience, so well known that nothing can be more so, that spirits who are in falsities flow into the thought, and induce a persuasion exactly as if what is false 
is true, so that it cannot possibly appear otherwise, and this they do from their sphere. In like manner genii, who are in evils, inflow in the same way into the will, and produce an effect exactly 
as if what is evil is good, so that it cannot possibly be felt otherwise; and this also from their sphere. This influx of spirits of both kinds it has been given me to plainly perceive a thousand times; 
also from whom it came, and how angels from the Lord removed such things; besides many other things that cannot so well be specifically narrated; so that I have become assured, with all possible certainty, 
whence come the falsities and evils with man; and also that such spheres as remain after the death of the body and manifest themselves so evidently, are from principles of falsity and cupidities of evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1511</b></p><p><b>1511.</b>
From much experience I have been led to know, and in such a way that nothing can be known more fully, that spirits who are immersed in falsities flow into the thought present in others and are so utterly 
persuasive in making falsity look like truth that such falsity cannot possibly be seen as anything other than truth; and this they accomplish by their sphere. It is similar with genii who are immersed 
in evils. These in a similar way flow into the will, making evil seem so utterly like good that such evil cannot possibly be perceived as anything other than good; and they too accomplish it by 
their sphere. I have been allowed to perceive clearly that influx of spirits or of genii a thousand times, and also to perceive from whom it came, as well as how angels from the Lord removed those influences, 
besides many other things which cannot easily be described in detail. From this it has become clear to me, surer than anything else can be, where the falsities and evils residing with man originate, 
and that the sources of such spheres as remain after the life of the body and manifest themselves so plainly are false assumptions and evil desires. </p>

</p><b>1511.</b>
A multa experientia mihi notum factum est, ac ita notum ut nihil notius, quod spiritus qui in falsis sunt, influant in cogitationem et persuadeant prorsus sicut falsum esset verum, sic ut nullatenus 
aliter apparere possit, et hoc ex sphaera eorum. Similiter genii qui in malis sunt, ita influunt in voluntatem et efficiunt prorsus sicut malum esset bonum, sic ut nullatenus aliter sentiri possit, et 
hoc quoque ex sphaera eorum; influxus illorum et horum millies datum percipere manifeste, tum a quibus, ut et quomodo angeli a Domino illa removerint, praeter plura quae speciatim non ita dici possunt. 
 Inde, ita pro certo ut nihil certius, mihi constare potuit unde falsa et mala apud hominem; et quod ex principiis falsi, et ex cupiditatibus mali, tales sphaerae, quae post vitam corporis manent 
et se tam evidenter manifestant. </p>
