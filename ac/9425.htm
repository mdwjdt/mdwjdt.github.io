<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9425节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9425.</strong>“凡有话的，都可以就近他们去”表通过这些教义，虚假将被除去。这从“有话”和“就近他们”的含义清楚可知：“有话”是指关于真理的争论，因为“话”是指真理（参看<a href="1288.htm">1288</a>，<a href="4692.htm">4692</a>，<a href="5272.htm">5272</a>节）；“就近他们”是指如此行是为了叫他们能通过这些教义来判定（因为他们所就近的“亚伦”和“户珥”表示源于圣言外在意义的教义），因而也是为了虚假能被除去。因为人若在关于真理的争论上通过教义来判定，就会除去虚假。然而，亚伦没有除去虚假，反而除去真理，这一点从下文所描述的敬拜牛犊而不是耶和华明显看出来。因为如刚才所述，那些教导没有任何内在事物，因而没有良善和真理的纯正教义的圣言外在事物的人看不出真理与虚假之间的不同，也看不出良善与邪恶之间的不同。相反，凡与感官幻觉相一致的，他们都称之为真理；凡与私欲相一致的，他们都称之为良善。因此，他们称虚假为真理，称邪恶为良善。</p>

Whosoever hath words, let him come near unto them. That this signifies that falsities are thereby to be removed, is evident from the signification of "having words," as being to dispute about truths; 
for "words" denote truths (see n. 1288, 4692, 5272); and from the signification of "coming near unto them," as being that they may be judged from that doctrine; for by "Aaron and Hur," to whom they were 
to "come near," is signified doctrine from the external sense of the Word; and also that falsities are to be removed, for he removes falsities who in a dispute about truths judges from doctrine. That 
Aaron, however, did not remove falsities, but removed truths, is evident from the worship of the calf instead of Jehovah; of which in what follows. For, as just said, those who teach the external 
things of the Word apart from anything internal, thus without the genuine doctrine of good and truth, do not discriminate between truth and falsity, nor between good and evil; but call that truth which 
favors the fallacies of the senses, and that good which favors concupiscences. Thus they call falsity truth, and evil they call good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9425</b></p><p><b>9425.</b>
'He who has words, let him go to them' means that by means of those teachings falsities are to be removed. This is clear from the meaning of 'having words' as disputing in regard to truths, for 'words' 
are truths, <a href="1288.htm">1288</a>, <a href="4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="5272.htm">5272</a>; and from the meaning of 'going to them' as doing so in order that they may be judged by means of those teachings (for teachings derived from the outward sense of the Word 
are meant by 'Aaron and Hur', to whom they were to go) thus also in order that falsities may be removed. For one who judges by means of doctrinal teachings in a dispute about truths removes falsities. 
Aaron however did not remove falsities; instead he removed truths, as is clear from the worship of the golden calf in place of Jehovah, described further on. For as stated just above, those who teach 
the outward things of the Word without the aid of what lies within, thus without the aid of authentic teachings about what is good and true, do not see the difference between truth and falsity, nor 
between good and evil. Rather, whatever coincides with the illusions of the senses they call truth, and whatever coincides with selfish cravings they call good. So they call falsity truth, and evil 
they call good.  </p>

`Qui habens verba, accedat ad illos': quod significet quod inde removenda falsa, constat ex significatione `habere verba quod sit litigare de veris, `verba' enim sunt vera, n. 1288, 4692, 5272: et ex 
significatione `accedere ad illos' quod sit ut judicentur ex doctrina illa, nam per `Aharonem et Churem,' ad quos accederent, significatur doctrina ex sensu externo Verbi; ita quoque ut removeantur 
falsa, nam qui judicat ex doctrina in lite de veris, is removet falsa; ast quod non {1}}removerit falsa sed quod {1}removerit vera, constat ex cultu vituli pro Jehovah, de quo in sequentibus; nam, ut 
mox supra dictum est, qui absque interno docent externa Verbi, ita absque genuina doctrina boni et veri, {2}illi non discernunt inter verum et falsum nec inter bonum et malum, sed verum dicunt quod favet 
fallaciis sensuum et bonum quod favet concupiscentiis, ita falsum dicunt verum et malum dicunt bonum. @1 removerint$ @2 illi non sciunt quid verum et bonum, et quid falsum et malum$ </p>
