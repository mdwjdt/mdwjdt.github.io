<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9827节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9827.</strong>“冠冕”表聪明和智慧。这从“冠冕”的含义清楚可知，“冠冕”是指聪明和智慧。“冠冕”之所以具有这种含义，是因为它是头上的遮盖物，而“头”表示属于聪明和智慧的人的内层事物或能力（参看<a href="9656.htm">9656</a>节）。所有类型的衣服都从它们所遮盖的身体部位获得自己的含义，如：遮盖胸部的，像胸甲；遮盖两腰的，像裤子；遮盖双脚的，像袜子；遮盖脚底的，像鞋子；还有一种遮盖头部的，像冠冕、头巾或帽子。<br />事实就是如此，这一点从来世的代表明显看出来。在来世，当智慧和聪明从灵人那里被夺走时，如天使社群从他们那里被移走时的情形，他们头上的遮盖物看上去就从他们身上被拿走了。一旦发生这种事，一个灵人就会变得愚蠢，丧失对真理和良善的任何觉知。后来由于聪明和智慧又回来了，他的头得以遮盖。不过，在来世，头上的遮盖物与其说表示属于良善的智慧，不如说表示属于真理的聪明。然而，属于亚伦的冠冕也表示智慧，因为它是由细麻布做的，上面还有圣冠；这圣冠是一块纯金制成的牌子，上面刻着：“归耶和华为圣”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.36.htm">28:36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.38.htm">38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.6.htm">29:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.28.htm">39:28</a>）。但普通的细麻布冠冕和属于亚伦的其它衣服表示属于真理的聪明，但不表示属于良善的智慧。关于这些衣服和这个冠冕，可参看利未记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.4.htm">16:4</a>）和以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.18.htm">44:18</a>）。因为“细麻布”或“亚麻布”表示从人心智的属世层里面的真理（<a href="7601.htm">7601</a>节）；因此，普通的亚麻布冠冕表示属世层中的聪明。<br />人若不知道代表和对应是怎么回事，就很难被引导相信所表示的是这类事物。不过，让他们认真考虑一下，在天堂所感知的是属灵事物，而不是属世事物；因而所感知的不是冠冕，也不是一般的衣服，而是诸如属于聪明和智慧，也属于信和爱的那类事物，一般是诸如属于真理和良善的那类事物。这一切都是属灵事物，因为天堂是一个属灵的世界。再让他们认真考虑一下，正是耶和华在西乃山上描述并规定了亚伦的衣服应是什么样；既然如此，那么这段描述的每个细节都含有神性属天层在里面，这神性属天层唯独通过关于对应和代表的知识被揭示出来。</p>

And a miter. That this signifies intelligence and wisdom, is evident from the signification of "a miter," as being intelligence and wisdom. A "miter" has this signification because it is a covering for 
the head, and by "the head" are signified the interior things of man that belong to intelligence and wisdom (see n. 9656). All articles of clothing derive their signification from the part of the body 
which they cover; as for instance that which covers the breast, like the breastplate; that which covers the loins, like the breeches; that which covers the feet, like the stockings; that which covers 
the soles of the feet, like the shoes; and so likewise that which covers the head, like the miter, the tiara, the cap.  [2] That such is the case is evident from the representatives in the other 
life. When wisdom and intelligence are taken away from spirits, as is the case when angelic societies are removed from them, the covering of the head appears to be taken away from them; and as soon as 
this is done they become stupid, and have no perception of truth and good; but afterward, as intelligence and wisdom return, the head is again covered. But in that life the coverings of the head do not 
so much signify the wisdom which is of good, as the intelligence which is of truth. The miter which belonged to Aaron, however, signifies wisdom also, because it was of fine linen, and the crown of 
holiness was placed upon it, which was a plate of pure gold, on which was engraven "Holiness to Jehovah" (of which below in this chapter, verses 36-38; and also in Exod. 29:6; 39:28). But "the miter 
of linen," and the other garments of linen, which also were for Aaron, signified the intelligence that is of truth; but not the wisdom that is of good (concerning these garments and this miter, see Lev. 
16:4; Ezek. 44:18). For "linen" signifies truth in man's natural (n. 7601); thus a "miter of linen" denotes natural intelligence.  [3] They who do not know how the case is with representatives and 
correspondences, can with difficulty be led to believe that such things are signified. But let them consider that in heaven spiritual things are perceived in the place of natural things; thus that in 
place of the miter, and in general in place of garments, such things are perceived as belong to intelligence and wisdom, and also to faith and love; in general such things as belong to truth and good; 
for all these are spiritual things, because heaven is a spiritual world. Let them consider also that the garments of Aaron were described and commanded by Jehovah on Mount Sinai, and that therefore 
within every detail there is the Divine celestial, and this is unfolded solely by means of knowledges about correspondences and representatives. </p>

'And a turban' means intelligence and wisdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'a turban' as intelligence and wisdom. 'A turban' has this meaning because it is a covering for the head, and 'the head' 
means a person's inward powers, which are those of intelligence and wisdom, <a href="9656.htm">9656</a>. All items of clothing derive their meaning from that part of the body which they cover, as for example with an item 
of clothing that covers the breast, such as a breastplate; those that cover the loins, such as trousers; those that cover the feet, such as stockings; those that cover the soles of the feet, such as sandals; 
and so also one that covers the head, such as a turban, headdress, or cap.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth of all this is clear from representatives in the next life. There, when wisdom and intelligence are 
taken away from spirits, which happens when angelic communities are removed from them, the covering on their head is seen to be taken away from them. Once this has been done a spirit becomes stupid, 
devoid of any perception of what is true and good. But afterwards, as intelligence and wisdom return, his head is covered again. But items of clothing on the head there mean not so much wisdom belonging 
to good as intelligence belonging to truth. The turban that belonged to Aaron however means wisdom as well, since it was made from fine linen, and a holy crown was placed on it, which was a plate made 
from pure gold, on which Holiness to Jehovah was engraved, described further on in verses 37, 39, of the present chapter, and also <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:6;%2039:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:6; 39:28</a>. But the turban of [ordinary] linen, and the rest 
of the garments of [such] linen which were also Aaron's, meant intelligence belonging to truth, but not wisdom belonging to good. Regarding those garments and that turban, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16:4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2044:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 44:18</a>. 
For 'linen' or 'flax' means truth in the natural level of a person's mind, <a href="7601.htm">7601</a>, so that 'a turban of [ordinary] linen' means intelligence there.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 People who have no knowledge of the nature 
of representatives and correspondences can scarcely be brought to believe that such things are meant. But let them weigh up this, that in heaven spiritual realities are envisaged instead of natural things, 
so that instead of a turban, and in general instead of garments, such things are envisaged as belong to intelligence and wisdom, also to faith and love, in general such as belong to truth and goodness. 
For all these are spiritual, since heaven is a spiritual world. Let them also weigh up this, that it was Jehovah on Mount Sinai who described and decreed what Aaron's garments should be, which 
being so, every detail of the description holds within itself the Divine Celestial, which is disclosed solely by means of knowledge about correspondences and representatives.  </p>

`Et cidarim': quod significet intelligentiam et sapientiam, constat ex significatione `cidaris' quod sit intelligentia et sapientia; quod `cidaris' id sit, est quia est tegumentum capitis, et per `caput' 
significantur interiora hominis, quae sunt intelligentiae et sapientiae, n. 9656; omnia indumenta trahunt significationem ab illa parte corporis quam tegunt; quemadmodum indumentum quod tegit pectus, 
sicut pectorale, quod tegit lumbos sicut femoralia, quod pedes sicut tibialia, {1} quod plantas pedum sicut calcei, ita quoque quod tegit caput {2}sicut cidaris, tiara, pileus. 	2 Quod ita sit, 
constat ex repraesentativis in altera vita; ibi spiritus, cum eis sapientia et intelligentia aufertur, quod fit cum societates angelicae ab (c)illis removentur, tunc tegumentum capitis apparet eis auferri, 
{3}quo facto fit stupidus, et nullius perceptionis veri et boni, et {4}postea ut redit intelligentia et sapientia, caput {5} rursus tegitur; {6}at indumenta capitis ibi non ita significant sapientiam 
quae boni, sed intelligentiam quae veri; {7}cidaris autem quae Aharoni, etiam significat sapientiam, quoniam ex bysso erat, et appositum coronamentum sanctitatis, quod erat bractea ex auro puro, 
cui insculptum Sanctitas Jehovae, de qua in sequentibus hujus capitis vers. 37, 39, tum Exod. xxix 6, xxxix 28; at cidaris lini, {8}et reliquae vestes lini quae etiam erant {9}Aharoni, significabant 
intelligentiam quae veri, non autem sapientiam quae boni; de illis vestibus, et de illa cidari, videatur Lev. xvi 4; Ezech. xliv 18; `linum' enim {10}significat verum in naturali {11}hominis, n. 7601, 
ita `cidaris lini' est intelligentia naturalis. 	3 Qui non sciunt quomodo cum repraesentativis et correspondentiis se habet, aegre adduci possunt ad credendum quod talia significentur; sed expendant 
quod spiritualia loco naturalium in caelo percipiantur, {1} ita loco cidaris, et in genere loco vestium, talia quae sunt intelligentiae et sapientiae, {12}tum fidei et amoris, in genere quae sunt veri 
et boni, nam illa et haec sunt spiritualia; est enim caelum mundus spiritualis; ut stupidi nullius perceptionis veri et boni sunt expendant etiam quod vestes Aharonis in monte Sinai a Jehovah descriptae 
et mandatae sint, et quod sic in singulis sit Divinum Caeleste quod inest, et evolvitur solum per cognitiones de correspondentiis et {13}repraesentativis. @1 i et$ @2 d sicut i nempe$ @3 et tunc
