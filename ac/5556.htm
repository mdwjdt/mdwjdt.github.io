<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5556.</strong>我还被允许知道那些构成皮肤鳞片区域的灵人都是谁。皮肤的这片区域所拥有的感觉，比身体的其它任何覆盖物所拥有的都要少，因为它被厚厚的、就像柔软的软骨一样的鳞片覆盖着。构成鳞片状皮肤的社群是那些推理这样那样的事是不是真的，却仅止于推理，不再往前推进的人。与他们交谈时，我被允许发觉他们根本就不明白什么是真，什么是假；并且他们越推理，越不明白。然而，他们却觉得自己比谁都有智慧，因为他们将智慧等同于推理能力。他们完全不知道智慧的主要特征是不用推理就能发觉事情是真是假。这些灵人当中有许多在世时就是这样，他们通过哲学论证将良善与真理置于混乱之中而变得如此，并由此比任何人都缺乏常识。</p>

It has also been given me to know who constitute the scarf skin. This skin is less sensitive than any other of the coverings, for it is covered over with scales that are nearly like a thin cartilage. 
The societies which constitute it are they who reason about all things as to whether it be so or not so, and go no further. When I spoke with them, it was given to perceive that they do not at all apprehend 
what is true or not true; and the more they reason, the less they apprehend. Yet they seem to themselves wiser than others, for they vest wisdom in the faculty of reasoning. They are altogether 
ignorant that the chief thing in wisdom is to perceive without reasoning, that a thing is so or not so. Many such are from those who in the world became so from a confusion of good and truth through 
philosophical subtleties, and who thereby have the less common sense. </p>

I have also been allowed to know who those spirits are that constitute the scaly area of the skin. This area of the skin, more than any other casings of the body, possesses the least amount of feeling, 
since it is thickly covered with scales which are rather like soft gristle. The communities constituting that scale-like skin are ones who engage in reasoning about everything, about whether such-and-such 
a thing is true or not, yet go no further than just reasoning. When I spoke to them I was allowed to perceive that they had no understanding at all of what was true or untrue; and the more they 
go on reasoning the less they understand. Even so, they seem to themselves to be wiser than others, for they identify wisdom with an ability to reason. They are totally unaware of the fact that the 
chief characteristic of wisdom is perceiving, without the use of reasoning, that a thing is true or untrue. Many of these spirits belong to those who in the world became like this because of the confusion 
into which goodness and truth had been thrown by philosophical arguments, as a result of which they possess less common sense than anybody else. </p>

Quinam cutem squamosam constituunt, etiam scire datum est; illa cutis prae involucris reliquis est minime sensibilis, obsita enim est squamis quae ad subtile cartilagineum accedunt; societates quae 
illam constituunt {1}, sunt qui ratiocinantur de omnibus rebus num ita sit, vel non ita sit, nec vadunt ulterius; quando locutus cum illis, percipere dabatur quod prorsus nihil caperent quid verum vel 
non verum; et illi quo magis ratiocinantur eo minus capiunt; videntur usque sibi sapientes prae aliis, nam in facultate ratiocinandi ponunt sapientiam; prorsus non sciunt quod praecipuum {2} sapientiae 
sit percipere absque ratiocinatione quod ita sit, vel non ita.  Sunt eorum plures ex illis qui in mundo tales facti sunt ex confusione boni et veri per philosophica, quibus inde minus sensus communis. @1
