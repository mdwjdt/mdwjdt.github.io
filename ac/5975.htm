<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5975节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5975.</strong>“趁我未死以先，我要去见他”表渴望在新事物到来之前结合。这从“去见”和“趁我未死以先”的含义清楚可知。“去见”是指联结；“见”之所以表示联结，是因为在灵界，内视将人们联结起来。事实上，内视是思维，当一个社群或有组织的团体中有许多人行如一体时，一个人所想的，就是另一个人所想的，也是另一个人所想的；因此，是思维将他们联结在一起。另外，当一个人想到另一个人时，那个人就会出现，与他同在；思维也以这种方式将两个人联结在一起。正因如此，“去见”表示联结。对这种联结的渴望是从刚才（<a href="5974.htm">5974</a>节）所提到的喜悦流出的。“趁我未死以先”是指在新事物，也就是代表的新阶段到来之前。因为在圣言中，代表以下列方式彼此接续：当一个人死去时，要么这个代表通过另一个人继续，要么另一个代表随后出现；因而新的事物到来（参看<a href="3253.htm">3253</a>，<a href="3259.htm">3259</a>，<a href="3276.htm">3276</a>节）。如亚伯拉罕死了，以撒所作的代表接续；以撒死了，雅各所作的代表接续；雅各死了，他的后代所作的代表接续。这就是此处所表示的新情况。</p>

I will go and see him before I die. That this signifies a longing for conjunction previous to what is new, is evident from the signification of "going and seeing," as being to be conjoined. The reason 
why "to see" denotes to be conjoined is that in the spiritual world interior sight conjoins. For interior sight is thought, and in a society there when many act as a one (and also in choirs), what the 
one thinks the other also thinks; thus thought conjoins. And likewise when anyone thinks of another, he is presented to view; in this way also thought conjoins. Hence it is that by "going and seeing" 
is signified conjunction. That a longing for conjunction is signified, follows from the joy spoken of just above (n. 5974). And from the signification of "before I die," as being previous to what is 
new, namely, to what is new of representation. For in the Word representatives succeed each other in such a manner that when one person dies, there follows either a like representative by another person, 
or another representative; thus what is new (see n. 3253, 3259, 3276); as when Abraham died, a representative by Isaac succeeded; and when he died, a representative by Jacob succeeded; and when 
he died, a representative by his posterity succeeded. This is the new thing here meant. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5975</b></p><p><b>5975.</b>
'I will go and see him before I die' means the desire to be joined before what is new comes in. This is clear from the meaning of 'going and seeing' as being joined together (the reason 'seeing' is being 
joined together is that in the spiritual world inward seeing joins people together. Inward seeing is thought, and when in a community there many act as one, and also in organized groups, what one 
person thinks is also what another thinks, so that thought links them together. In addition, when someone thinks about another person, that person becomes present with him, so that again thought joins 
them together. Here is the reason why 'going and seeing' means a joining together; and the desire for such a joining together flows from the joy referred to immediately above in <a href="5974.htm">5974</a>); and from the 
meaning of 'before I die' as before what is new, that is to say, a new phase in representation comes in. For in the Word representatives succeed one another in the following way: When one person dies, 
then either the same representation is continued through another person or else a different representation, thus what is new comes in, a subject dealt with in <a href="3253.htm">3253</a>, <a href="3259.htm">3259</a>, <a href="3276.htm">3276</a>. When for example Abraham 
died, there followed a representative through Isaac; when he died, a representative through Jacob; and when he too died, a representative through his descendants. This new situation is what is meant here. </p>

`Ibo et videbo illum antequam morior': quod significet   desiderium conjunctionis, antequam novum, constat ex significatione `ire et videre' quod sit conjungi; {1}quod `videre' sit conjungi, est quia 
interior visus in mundo spirituali conjungit; interior visus est cogitatio, et ibi in societate, quando plures ut unum agunt, {2}et quoque in choris, quod cogitat unus, etiam cogitat alter, ita cogitatio 
conjungit; et quoque cum (x)quidam cogitat de aliquo, sistitur is praesens, ita quoque conjungit; inde est quod per `ire et videre' significetur conjunctio; quod desiderium conjunctionis sit, fluit 
ex gaudio, de quo mox supra n. (x)5974; et ex significatione `antequam morior' quod sit antequam novum, nempe novum repraesentationis; in Verbo enim repraesentativa ita succedunt ut cum unus moritur, 
sequatur repraesentativum vel simile per alium, vel aliud, ita novum, de qua re n. 3253, 3259, 3276; sicuti cum Abraham mortuus est, successit repraesentativum per Jishakum; et cum hic mortuus, successit 
repraesentativum per Jacobum;  et cum hic mortuus, {3}successit repraesentativum per posteros ejus; hoc novum est quod {4} intelligitur. @1 interior enim visus in altera vita conjungit$ @2 I
