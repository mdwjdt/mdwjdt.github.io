<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5060.</strong>至于对应于睾丸的是谁，这以同样的方式从那些陷入婚姻之爱的对立面，并在睾丸施加疼痛的人向我清楚显明。因为当社群进行运作时，他们便作用于他们所对应的这些部位和身体的这些肢体。天堂社群以一种温柔、甜蜜和快乐的流注作用于它们，而在反面的地狱社群则以一种恶毒并造成疼痛的流注作用于它们。然而，只有那些内层已被打开，并由此能感知其与灵界的交流之人才能察觉到他们的流注。那些陷入婚姻之爱的对立面，在睾丸施加疼痛的人是利用爱、友情、善举将人诱入网罗的灵人。当这类灵人靠近我时，他们想和我私下交谈，极其害怕有人在场，因为活在肉身时，他们的本性一直是这样；由于那时是这样，所以他们在来世还是这样，因为每个人的生活都会跟随着他，与他同在。<br />有某种可以说像空气一样几乎看不见的东西从欣嫩子谷或火坑周围地区升腾上来。这是一帮如刚才所描述的那类灵人。但此后，他们尽管为数众多，在我看来却像一个缠着绷带的灵人；然而，他似乎自己除去了这绷带。这是一个迹象，表示他们想除去障碍；因为在灵人界，像这样的代表形像有助于揭示人们的思维和意图；一看到这些形像，它们的含义就立刻被识别出来。在此之后，从这帮灵人当中出来一个灵人，他看似一个雪白的小灵人，并向我走来。这是他们思维和意图的一个代表，即他们想表现出纯真的状态，好叫人不怀疑他们的真实秉性。他来到我这里后，便朝我两腰弯下腰来，似乎要把自己缠在我的两腰上，这代表他们想将自己表现为充满贞洁的婚姻之爱的灵人。之后，他似乎像线圈一样缠绕在我脚上，这代表他们想通过诸如自然界中令人快乐的那类事物慢慢渗透进来。最后，这小灵人几乎看不见了，这代表他们想完全隐藏起来。<br />天使告诉我，这种渗透就是那些在婚姻之爱方面以诡诈待人之人的特征；也就是说，他们在世时怀着与其他男人的妻子通奸的意图，通过贞洁、理智地谈论婚姻之爱，爱抚孩子，极尽所能地赞美丈夫而渗透进来。他们做这一切是为了被视为友好、贞洁和无辜；而事实上，他们是骗人的奸夫。他们的品质也向我显明，因为上述这些事完成后，那个雪白的小灵人又出现了，不过现在却显得暗淡、黢黑，而且还非常畸形。于是，他被投入自己的地狱，这地狱深深向下，就在两腰中间部分的下面。他们在那里住在最污秽的粪便中，而且也在前面（<a href="4327.htm">4327</a>节）所描述的与总体和非自主的感官活动有关的强盗当中。后来，我又与这类灵人交谈，令他们感到惊讶的是，任何人都当有反对通奸的良心，也就是说，即便允许，他的良心也会禁止他与另一个男人的妻子同寝。事实上，当我与他们谈论良心时，他们拒绝相信任何人都有良心。我被告知，这类灵人大部分来自基督教界，很少来自世界其它地方。</p>

Who they are that correspond to the testicles, was in like manner evident to me from those who are in what is contrary to conjugial love, and who inflict pain on the testicles; for when societies operate 
they act upon those parts and those members of the body to which they correspond-heavenly societies by a gentle, sweet, delightful influx; and infernal ones, who are in what is contrary, by a severe 
and painful influx. But their influx is perceived by those only whose interiors have been opened, and who thereby have received perceptible communication with the spiritual world. They who are in 
what is contrary to conjugial love and who inflict pain on the testicles, are those who ensnare by love, friendship, and kind offices. When such spirits approached me they desired to speak with me in 
private, being exceedingly fearful lest anyone should be present, for this had been their character in the life of the body; and being such then, they are such in the other life also, because everyone's 
life remains with him.  [2] There arose from the region about Gehenna somewhat aerial and inconspicuous. It was a company of such spirits, but though there were many in it, it afterward appeared to 
me as only one spirit hampered with bandages, which however he seemed to himself to remove, whereby was signified that they desired to remove obstacles; for in such a manner do the thoughts and efforts 
of the mind appear representatively in the world of spirits, and when they appear, it is instantly perceived what they signify. Afterward it seemed as if there came forth from his body a little snow-white 
spirit, who drew near to me, by which was represented their thought and intention-that they desired to assume a state of innocence, so that no one might suspect their real character. When he 
came to me, he let himself down toward the loins, and seemed to wind himself as it were about both of them, whereby was represented that they desired to exhibit themselves in chaste conjugial love; afterward 
he seemed to wind himself about the feet in spiral coils, whereby was represented that they desired to insinuate themselves by such things as are delightful in nature. At last that little spirit 
became almost invisible, by which was represented that they desire to lie wholly concealed. [3] I was told by angels that such instilling belongs to those who seek to ensnare in conjugial love, that 
is to say, those who in the world have instilled themselves with the end to commit adultery with wives, by speaking chastely and sanely about conjugial love, by caressing the children, by praising 
the husband in every possible way, so as to be believed to be friendly, chaste, and innocent, when yet they are deceitful adulterers. Their quality was also shown me, for after these things had been done, 
that little snow-white spirit became visible, and appeared dusky and very black, and also very deformed; and he was cast out into his hell, which was deep under the middle part of the loins. There 
they dwell in the foulest excrements; and they are also among the robbers there who bear relation to the general involuntary sense (n. 4327). I afterward conversed with such spirits, and they were surprised 
that anyone should make adultery a matter of conscience, that is, that from conscience he would not lie with another's wife when allowed; and when I talked with them about conscience, they denied 
that anyone has conscience. I was told that such spirits are for the most part from Christendom, and seldom from other parts of the world. </p>

Who exactly correspond to the testicles has in a similar way been made clear to me from those whose love is the opposite of conjugial love and who strike pain into the testicles. For when communities 
are at work they act into those parts and members of the body to which they correspond - heavenly communities acting into them by an influx that is gentle, sweet, and delightful, hellish communities 
who love the opposite of what is heavenly by an influx that is vicious and causes pain. Yet their influx is not perceptible to any except those whose interiors have been opened and who as a consequence 
are able to perceive their communication with the spiritual world. Those whose love is the opposite of conjugial love and who strike pain into the testicles are spirits who use love, friendship, and 
kind deeds to behave treacherously. When such spirits came near me they wished to talk to me in secret, being very much afraid that someone else might be present with us. For this is what those spirits 
were like during their lifetime, and being such then, they are no different in the next life. For everyone's life follows on with him. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 From the region round Gehenna there once rose up something 
so to speak air-like and barely visible. It was a band of spirits who were like those just described. But after that, although there were quite a number of them, they looked to me like a single spirit, 
who was impeded by bandages which however he seemed to himself to remove. This was a sign meaning their desire to remove obstructions, for in the world of spirits representative images like this 
one serve to reveal people's thoughts and intentions, and as soon as those images are seen their meaning is recognized instantly. After this, one who looked like a small snowy-white spirit seemed to 
come out of that band of spirits and to make his way towards me. This was a representation of their thought and intention, which was a wish to assume a state of innocence so that no one could suspect 
them of being what they were in fact like. When he reached me he stooped down towards my loins, where he seemed to wind himself all round them. This represented their wish to present themselves as spirits 
filled with chaste conjugial love. After this he seemed to twist like a coil around my feet, which represented their wish to worm their way in by means of such things as are naturally delightful. 
At length the small spirit became practically invisible, which represented their wish to lie completely out of sight. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Angels told me that worming their way in like this is characteristic of those 
who deal treacherously in respect of conjugial love. That is to say, being intent on committing adultery with other men's wives they would worm their way in, when they were in the world, by talking 
about conjugial love in a chaste and wholesome manner, by fondling the children and praising the husband in every possible way. They did all this so as to be considered friendly, chaste, and above suspicion, 
when in fact they were deceitful adulterers. Such being their true nature therefore, this was revealed, for once the incidents described above had taken place, the small snowy-white spirit became 
visible again. But now he had a dusky and very black appearance, and also a misshapen one. He was cast out into his own hell, which too was deep down below the middle of the loins, where the inhabitants 
live among utterly disgusting excrement, and also among the robbers, described in <a href="4327.htm">4327</a>, who correlate with general and involuntary sensory activity. I have spoken subsequently to spirits of this 
kind, who have been amazed that anyone should have any conscientious objection to committing adultery, that is to say, that his conscience should forbid him to lie with another man's wife even if 
allowed to do so. Indeed when I have talked to them about conscience they have refused to believe that anyone possesses a conscience. I have been told that spirits like these come mainly from the Christian 
world, and only rarely do any come from other parts. </p>

Quinam sunt qui testibus {1} correspondent, constare mihi potuit similiter ab illis qui in contrariis amori conjugiali sunt, et testibus {1} dolorem incutiunt; societates enim cum operantur, agunt 
in illas partes et in illa membra corporis, quibus correspondent, caelestes `societates' in illa per influxum lenem, dulcem, jucundum, infernales qui in contrariis sunt, per influxum immitem et dolorificum; 
sed influxus illorum non percipitur quam ab illis quibus interiora aperta sunt, et inde communicatio perceptibilis data est cum mundo spirituali. Qui in contrariis amori conjugiali sunt, 
et testibus {1} dolorem incutiunt, sunt qui insidiantur per amorem, amicitiam, et officia; tales cum ad me venerunt, volebant in occulto mecum loqui, timentes valde ne quis {2} adesset; tales enim 
in vita corporis eorum fuerunt, et quia tales tunc, etiam tales in altera vita sunt; unumquemvis enim sua vita sequitur.  [2] Assurgebat e regione circa Gehennam sicut quoddam aereum inconspicuum, 
fuit cohors talium spirituum; sed apparuit dein mihi solum {3} sicut unus tametsi plures essent, cui objiciebantur {4} fasciae quas tamen removere sibi videbatur, quo significabatur quod removere 
vellent obstacula, taliter enim cogitationes et molimina mentis apparent repraesentative in mundo spirituum, et cum apparent, appercipitur ilico quid significant; </p>
<p>postea videbatur sicut exiret e corpore 
ejus quidam parvus niveus, qui accessit ad me, per quod repraesentabatur cogitatio et intentio eorum, quod induere vellent innocentiae statum ut nemo quid tale de illis suspicari posset; is cum 
venit ad me, demisit se versus lumbos, et circum utrosque (t)quasi se flectere videbatur, quo repraesentabatur quod in casto amore conjugiali se sistere vellent {5}; dein circum pedes per flexus 
spirales, quo repraesentabatur quod se insinuare vellent per talia quae in natura sunt jucunda; </p>
<p>tandem ille unus (o)parvus paene inconspicuus factus est, quo repraesentabatur quod prorsus latere vellent. 
 [3] Dictum mihi ab angelis quod talis insinuatio illis sit qui insidiantur in amore conjugiali nempe qui in mundo insinuaverunt {6} se fine adulterandi cum uxoribus, loquendo caste et sane 
de amore conjugiali, infantibus adblandiendo, laudando maritum quocumque modo, usque ut credatur amicus, castus, et insons, cum tamen est dolosus adulter.  Quales itaque sunt, ostensum quoque est; 
illis enim peractis, niveus ille parvus conspicuus factus est, et apparuit furvus et nigerrimus, et praeterea deformissimus; ejectusque est in infernum suum, quod etiam erat profunde sub media parte 
lumborum; ibi degunt in excrementitiis foedissimis; suntque etiam ibi inter latrones qui referunt sensum communem involuntarium, de quibus n. 4327.  Locutus sum cum talibus etiam dein, et mirati 
sunt quod aliquis conscientiam pro adulteriis habeat, nempe ut ex conscientia non concumbat cum alterius uxore cum licet; et cum locutus sum cum illis conscientia, negarunt quod alicui sit conscientia; 
dictum mihi quod tales utplurimum sint ex orbe Christiano, ac raro aliqui ex aliis partibus. </p>
