Verses 14-18. And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, saying, Wherefore do ye not complete your task in making brick, as yesterday and the day 
before yesterday, also yesterday, also today? And the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore doest thou so to thy servants? There is no straw given to thy servants, 
and they say to us, Make ye bricks; and behold thy servants are beaten; and thy people have sinned. And he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah. 
And now go, serve ye, and straw shall not be given you, and the tale of bricks shall ye give. "And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten," signifies that they who most closely received and 
communicated the infestations were injured by the injected falsities; "whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them," signifies those who were injected by the infesters; "saying, Wherefore do ye not 
complete your task in making bricks?" signifies that they do not receive and communicate the injections of falsities as had been enjoined; "as yesterday and the day before yesterday," signifies as in 
the former state; "also yesterday also today," signifies the state that will be therefrom; "and the officers of the sons of Israel came," signifies those who most closely received and communicated; "and 
cried unto Pharaoh," signifies indignation testified before those who were infesting; "saying, wherefore doest thou thus to thy servants?" signifies that thus they could not perform the duty enjoined; 
"there is no straw given to thy servants," signifies that memory-knowledges containing truth are no longer furnished; "and they say to us, Make ye bricks," signifies that they must nevertheless endure 
the injected falsities; "and behold thy servants are beaten," signifies that in this way the falsities inflict injury; "and thy people have sinned," signifies that thus they are guilty in having 
done evil; "and he said," signifies the answer; "Ye are idle, ye are idle," signifies that they have not been sufficiently assaulted; "therefore ye say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah," signifies 
that from this comes the thought about such worship; "and now go, serve ye," signifies continuation of the infestation; "and straw shall not be given you," signifies without such memory-knowledges; 
"and the tale of bricks ye shall give," signifies the falsities which were to be injected in abundance. </p>

Verses 14-18 And the officers of the children of Israel were beaten, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, saying, Why do you not finish your appointed task to make bricks, as you did yesterday 
and the day before<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - as yesterday, so today? And the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal thus with your servants? No straw is given to your servants, 
and they say to us, Make bricks. And behold, your servants are beaten, and your people have sinned. And he said, You are slack, you are slack! Therefore you say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to 
Jehovah. And now go, serve;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and no straw will be given you, and you shall deliver the tally of bricks. </p>
<p>'And the officers of the children of Israel were beaten' means that those in the nearest position 
to receive molestations and pass them on suffered harm from the falsities that had been introduced. 'Whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them' means those who were introduced by the ones who 
were the molesters. 'Saying, Why do you not finish your appointed task to make bricks' means that they fail to do as they have been commanded, to receive and then pass on the falsities that have been 
introduced. 'As you did yesterday and the day before' means as they did in the previous state. 'As yesterday, so today' means the state to come, from then on. 'And the officers of the children of Israel 
came' means those in the nearest position to receive things and pass them on. 'And cried out to Pharaoh' means resentment expressed to those who were molesting. 'Saying, Why do you deal thus with 
your servants?' means that under the present circumstances they could not perform their prescribed function. 'No straw is given to your servants' means that they were no longer being supplied with factual 
knowledge that is a container for truth. 'And they say to us, Make bricks' means that still they had to put up with the falsities that had been introduced. 'And behold, your servants are beaten' 
means that for that reason the falsities cause harm. 'And your people have sinned' means that for this reason they are guilty of having done what is evil. 'And he said' means the reply. 'You are slack, 
you are slack!' means that they have not been sufficiently maltreated. 'Therefore you say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah' means that for that reason they give thought to such worship. 'And 
now go, serve' means a continuation of the molestation. 'And no straw will be given you' means without that kind of factual knowledge. 'And you shall deliver the tally of bricks' means the falsities 
which are to be introduced in abundance.

Vers. 14-18.  Et percussi sunt moderatores filiorum Israelis, quos posuerunt super illos exactores Pharaonis, dicendo, Quare non absolvitis statutum vestrum ad laterificandum sicut heri nudius tertius, 
etiam heri, etiam hodie?  Et venerunt moderatores filiorum Israelis, et clamaverunt ad Pharaonem, dicendo, Quare facis sic servis tuis?  Palea nulla datur servis tuis, et lateres, dicunt nobis, Facite, 
et ecce servi tui percutiuntur; et peccavit populus tuus.  Et dixit, Remissi vos, remissi, propterea vos dicitis, Eamus, sacrificemus Jehovae.  Et nunc ite, servite, et palea non dabitur vobis, 
et demensum laterum dabitis.  `Et percussi sunt moderatores filiorum Israelis' significat quod illi qui proxime infestationes receperunt et communicarunt ex injectis falsis laesi sint: `quos posuerunt 
super illos exactores Pharaonis' significat illos qui ab infestatoribus injecti sunt: `dicendo, Quare non absolvitis statutum vestrum ad laterificandum' significat quod non, sicut injunctum est, recipiant 
et communicent injectiones falsorum: `sicut heri nudius tertius' significat ut in statu priore: `etiam heri, etiam hodie' significat statum inde futurum:  `et venerunt moderatores filiorum Israelis' 
significat illos qui proxime receperunt et communicarunt: `et clamaverunt ad Pharaonem' significat indignationem contestatam coram illis qui infestabant: `dicendo, Quare {1}facis sic servis tuis?' 
significat quod sic officio injuncto non possent fungi: `palea nulla datur servis tuis' significat quod scientifica continentia veri non amplius subministrentur: `et lateres, dicunt nobis, Facite' significat 
quod injecta falsa usque sustinebunt: `et ecce servi tui percutiuntur' significat quod sic falsa laedant: `et peccavit populus tuus' significat quod sic illis reatus quod malum fecerint: `et 
dixit' significat responsum:  `Remissi vos, remissi' significat quod non satis impugnati fuerint: `propterea vos dicitis, Eamus, sacrificemus Jehovae' significat quod inde cogitatio de tali cultu: `et 
nunc ite, servite' significat infestationis continuum: `et palea non dabitur vobis' significat absque scientificis talibus: `et demensum laterum dabitis' significat falsa quae copia injicienda. 	@1
