<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5459.</strong>“我是敬畏神的，你们这么做就可以存活”表若它们要拥有来自神性的生命，事情就得这样。这从“这么做”、“存活”和“我敬畏神”的含义清楚可知：“这么做”是指事情就得这样；“存活”是指它们，即在此由“雅各的儿子们”所表示的真理要拥有生命；“我敬畏神”是指来自神性。因为“约瑟”代表来自神性的真理方面的主，来自神性的真理和属灵层的属天层是一样的，因此就至高意义而言，此处的“我”表示来自神性的真理，而“神”是指存在于属灵层的属天层里面，或存在于真理里面的神性本身。就至高意义而言，当论及主时，“敬畏”并非表示害怕，而是表示爱；此外，在圣言各处所提到的“敬畏神”表示对神的爱。因为对神之爱的性质取决于它的对象；在那些处于没有内在的外在敬拜之人当中，这爱成了害怕；在那些处于属灵敬拜的人当中，它变成神圣的敬畏；在那些处于属天敬拜的人当中，它则变成含有神圣敬畏感的爱；但主里面并没有敬畏，只有纯粹的爱。由此可见“我敬畏神”在论及主时，表示神性之爱，因而表示神性。</p>

This do, and live; I fear God. That this signifies that so it shall be if they have life from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "this do," as being that so it shall be; and from the signification 
of "and live," as being that they, namely the truths here signified by the "sons of Jacob," shall have life; and from the signification of "I fear God," as being from the Divine. For by Joseph 
is represented the Lord as to truth from the Divine, which is the same as the celestial of the spiritual; wherefore by "I" is here signified in the supreme sense truth from the Divine Itself which 
is in the celestial of the spiritual, or the Divine which is in truth. By "fearing," in the supreme sense, when predicated of the Lord, is not signified fear, but love; and moreover the "fear of God" 
occasionally in the Word signifies love to God. For love to God is according to the subjects of it; it becomes fear with those who are in external worship without internal, it becomes holy fear with 
those who are in spiritual worship, and it becomes love in which is holy reverence with those who are in celestial worship; but in the Lord there was not fear, but pure love. From this it may be seen 
that by "I fear God," when predicated of the Lord, is signified Divine love, thus the Divine. </p>

'Do this and you will live, [for] I fear God' means that so it will be if they have life from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'do this' as so it will be; from the meaning of 'you will live' 
as that they - the truths meant here by 'the sons of Jacob - will have life; and from the meaning of 'I fear God' as from the Divine. For 'Joseph' represents the Lord as regards truth from the Divine, 
which is the same as the celestial of the spiritual, and therefore 'I' here, in the highest sense, means truth from the Divine, while 'God' is the Divine itself that is present within the celestial 
of the spiritual or that is present within truth. In the highest sense, when it is used in reference to the Lord, 'fearing' does not mean fear but love. Also. 'the fear of God' mentioned in various 
places in the Word means a love that is felt for God, the exact nature of that love being determined by wherever it exists. Among those whose worship is external, devoid of anything internal, that love 
becomes fear; and among those whose worship is spiritual it becomes holy fear. But among those whose worship is celestial it becomes love that holds the feeling of sacred awe. Within the Lord however 
it was not fear at all but pure love. From this it may be seen that 'I fear God', when this has reference to the Lord, means Divine Love, and so the Divine. </p>

`Hoc facite, et vivetis, Deum ego timeo': quod significet quod ita erit si vita illis a Divino, constat ex significatione `hoc facite' quod sit quod ita erit; ex significatione `vivetis' quod sit quod 
vita illis, nempe veris, quae per `Jacobi filios' hic significantur; et ex significatione `Deum ego timeo' quod sit a Divino; per `Josephum' enim repraesentatur Dominus quoad verum a Divino, quod idem 
est cum caelesti spiritualis, quare per `ego' hic in sensu supremo significatur verum a Divino, et per `Deum' Ipsum Divinum quod in caelesti spiritualis, seu Divinum quod in vero; per `timere' in 
sensu supremo, cum praedicatur de Domino, non significatur timor sed amor; etiam`timor Dei' passim in Verbo significat amorem in Deum; se habet enim amor in Deum secundum subjecta, amor ille fit timor 
apud illos qui in {1} cultu externo sunt absque interno; et amor ille fit timor sanctus apud illos qui in cultu spirituali sunt; {2}at fit amor in quo {3} reverentia sancta, apud illos qui in cultu caelesti 
sunt; {4}sed in Domino non {5}erat timor sed purus amor; inde constare potest quod per `Deum ego timeo', cum praedicatur de Domino, significetur Divinus Amor, ita Divinum. @1 i naturali cultu
