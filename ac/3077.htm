<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3077节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3077.</strong>“不料，利百加出来了”表出自教义的真理情感。这从“利百加”的代表清楚可知。“利百加”是指要与神圣理性良善联结的神圣真理，但此处在订婚之前，她取的是出自教义的真理情感的代表，因为真理由此而来。然而，真理若没有生命在里面，就不是真理。真理的生命是情感，而情感是爱的属性。至于“利百加”代表要与神圣理性良善联结的神圣真理，这从出现在本章内义中的细节明显看出来，也可从以下事实看出来：即“以撒”代表主的神圣理性（<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="2066.htm">2066</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节）。因此，成为以撒妻子的“利百加”代表在理性里面像妻子联结于丈夫那样被联结的某种事物。这某种事物显然就是神圣真理，因为“亚伯拉罕”以同样的方式代表神圣良善本身，而“他妻子撒拉”则代表与神圣良善联结的神圣真理本身（<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="1901.htm">1901</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2065.htm">2065</a>，<a href="2904.htm">2904</a>节）。以撒和利百加代表类似的事，不过是在主的神性人里面，也就是在祂的理性中。<br />一般来说，在圣言中，“丈夫”表良善，“妻子”表真理（<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="2517.htm">2517</a>节）。此外，一切婚姻（也就是婚姻之爱）的本质也源于主里面良善与真理，并真理与良善的神圣婚姻（<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2728.htm">2728</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>节）。对真理的情感出自教义，这是因为经上说“她出来了”，也就是说，从城里出来了，而“城”表教义（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>节）。真理也出自教义。</p>

And behold Rebekah came out. That this signifies the affection of truth from doctrinal things, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being the truth Divine that was to be conjoined with the 
Divine good of the rational; but here, before she was betrothed, she puts on the representation of the affection of truth from doctrinal things; for from this comes truth, truth not being truth unless 
it has life, and its life is affection which is of love. That Rebekah represents the truth Divine that was to be conjoined with the Divine good of the rational, is evident from the several things 
contained in this chapter in the internal sense, and also from the fact that Isaac represents the Lord's Divine rational (n. 1893, 2066, 2083, 2630); thus Rebekah, who became wife to Isaac, represents 
that in the rational which was conjoined as a wife to a husband; and it may be seen that this is Divine truth. For in the same way Abraham represented the Divine good itself, and Sarah his wife the Divine 
truth itself conjoined with the Divine good (n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2904); and it is the same with Isaac and Rebekah, but in the Lord's Divine Human, namely, in His rational. In general, by 
a husband in the Word is signified good, and by a wife its truth (n. 1468, 2517). Moreover the essence of all marriage also (that is, conjugial love) is from the Divine marriage of good and truth, and 
of truth and good, in the Lord (n. 2508, 2618, 2728, 2729, 2803). That the affection of truth is from doctrinal things, is because it is said that she "came out," that is, from the city; and that by 
a "city" are signified doctrinal things, may be seen above (n. 402, 2451). Moreover truths are from doctrinal things. </p>

'That behold, Rebekah came out' means the affection for truth coming from matters of doctrine. This is clear from the representation of 'Rebekah' as Divine truth that was to be joined to the Divine Good 
of the Rational, though here, before she has been betrothed, she takes on the representation of the affection for truth coming from matters of doctrine; for from these comes forth truth. Truth however 
is not truth unless it has life within it, and that life is affection, which is an attribute of love. As regards 'Rebekah' representing Divine truth that was to be joined to the Divine good of the 
Rational, this is clear from the details that occur in this chapter in the internal sense, and also from the fact that 'Isaac' represents the Lord's Divine Rational, <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="2066.htm">2066</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>. Thus 'Rebekah', 
who became Isaac's wife, represents something within the Rational that was to be joined like a wife to a husband, and this something was clearly Divine Truth, for 'Abraham' in a similar way represented 
Divine Good itself, and 'Sarah his wife' Divine Truth itself joined to Divine Good, <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="1901.htm">1901</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2065.htm">2065</a>, <a href="2904.htm">2904</a>. Isaac and Rebekah represent something similar, but within the Lord's Divine 
Human, that is to say, within His Rational. </p>

 In general 'a husband' in the Word means good and 'his wife' truth, <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="2517.htm">2517</a>; for the essence of every marriage is derived, that is, conjugial love 
is derived, from the marriage of Divine Good to Truth, and of Truth to Good in the Lord, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2728.htm">2728</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>. The reason the affection for truth comes from matters of doctrine is that Rebekah 
is said 'to have come out', that is to say, out of the city, and 'a city' means matters of doctrine, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>. Truths too come from matters of doctrine. </p>

`Et ecce Rebecca exit': quod significet affectionem veri ex doctrinalibus, constat ex repraesentatione `Rebeccae' quod sit verum Divinum conjungendum Divino Bono Rationalis, hic vero antequam desponsata, 
induit repraesentationem affectionis veri e doctrinalibus, nam inde verum; verum enim non est verum nisi vita ei; vita ei est affectio quae est amoris.  Quod `Rebecca' repraesentet verum Divinum 
conjungendum bono Divino Rationalis, constat ex singulis quae in hoc capite in sensu interno, tum ex eo quod `Jishak' repraesentet Divinum Rationale Domini, n. 1893, 2066, 2083, 2630; ita `Rebecca' quae 
Jishako facta uxor, repraesentat illud in Rationali quod conjunctum est sicut uxor marito, quod hoc sit Divinum Verum, constare potest; similiter enim Abraham {1}repraesentavit Ipsum Divinum Bonum, 
et `Sarah uxor ejus' Ipsum Divinum Verum conjunctum Divino Bono, n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2904; `Jishak et Rebecca' similiter, sed in Divino Humano Domini, Ipsius nempe Rationali: [2] in genere per 
`maritum' in Verbo significatur bonum, et per `uxorem ejus' verum, n. 1468, 2517: est etiam essentia omnis conjugii, hoc est, amor conjugialis, ex conjugio Divino Boni et Veri ac Veri et Boni in Domino, 
n. 2508, 2618, 2728, 2729, 2803.  Quod affectio veri sit ex doctrinalibus, est quia dicitur quod exiverit, nempe ex urbe, quod per `urbem' significentur doctrinalia, videatur n. 402, (x)2449; vera 
etiam sunt ex doctrinalibus. @1 repraesentat$  </p>
