<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6851节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6851.</strong>“耶和华说，我已经看见我的百姓的困苦”表对被虚假侵扰后的那些属于属灵教会之人的怜悯。这从“说”、“我已经看见”、“困苦”和“百姓”的含义清楚可知：在圣言的历史中，“说”是指觉知，如前面频繁所述，但当论及耶和华或主时，它并非表示觉知，而表示全知，因为主自永恒就觉知并了解每一个事物；“我已经看见”，当论及耶和华或主时，是指怜悯，因为当主看见陷入悲惨或困苦的人时，祂就怜悯他（诚然，主看见所有人，因而怜悯所有人；然而并不是说祂谁都同情，祂怜悯那些接受祂的怜悯，也就是处于良善的人）；“困苦”是指侵扰（参看<a href="6663.htm">6663</a>节），在此是指虚假的侵扰，因为困苦来自埃及人，埃及人表示虚假的记忆知识（<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>节）；“百姓”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>节）。在圣言中，那些属于属天教会的人被称为“一个民族”。</p>

And Jehovah said, Seeing I have seen the affliction of My people. That this signifies mercy toward those who are of the spiritual church after infestations by falsities is evident from the signification 
of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being perception (of which frequently above); but when it is said of Jehovah, or the Lord, it does not denote perception, but omniscience, because the 
Lord perceives and knows each and all things from eternity; and from the signification of "Seeing I have seen" when said of Jehovah or the Lord, as being mercy, for when the Lord sees anyone in misery, 
or in affliction, He is merciful to him (the Lord indeed sees all, and thus is merciful to all, but it is not said that He is merciful with respect to any but those who receive His mercy, that is, 
who are in good); and from the signification of "affliction" as being infestation (see n. 6663), here by falsities, because by the Egyptians, by whom are signified false memory-knowledges (n. 6651, 6679, 
6683); and from the signification of "a people," as being those who are of the spiritual church n. 2928). They who are of the celestial church are in the Word called "a nation." </p>

'And Jehovah said, I have indeed seen the affliction of My people means the mercy shown towards those who belonged to the spiritual Church after molestations by falsities. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'saying' in the historical narratives of the Word as perception, dealt with often, though when used in reference to Jehovah or the Lord 'saying' does not mean perception but omniscience, since 
the Lord has from eternity a perception and knowledge of every single thing; from the meaning of 'indeed seeing', when used in reference to Jehovah or the Lord, as mercy, for when the Lord sees someone 
in distress or suffering affliction He has compassion on him (the Lord, it is true, sees everyone and so has compassion on everyone; yet it cannot really be said of any apart from those who accept His 
mercy, namely those governed by good, that He has compassion on them); from the meaning of 'affliction' as molestation, <a href="6663.htm">6663</a>, here by falsities since the affliction came from the Egyptians, by whom 
false factual knowledge is meant, <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, <a href="6679.htm">6679</a>, <a href="6683.htm">6683</a>; and from the meaning of 'people' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="2928.htm">2928</a> (those who belong to the celestial Church are referred 
to in the Word as 'a nation'). </p>

`Et dixit Jehovah, Videndo vidi afflictionem populi Mei': quod significet misericordiam erga illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali post infestationes a falsis, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis 
Verbi, quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius; at cum praedicatur de Jehovah seu Domino, non est perceptio sed omniscientia quia Dominus percipit et novit omnia et singula ab aeterno; a significatione 
`videndo videre' cum dicitur de Jehovah seu Domino, quod sit misericordia, nam cum Dominus videt aliquem in miseria seu in afflictione, ejus miseretur; Dominus quidem omnes videt, et ita omnium miseretur, 
sed (t)non de aliis dicitur quod illorum misereatur quam qui misericordiam Ipsius recipiunt, qui sunt illi qui in bono; ex significatione `afflictionis' quod sit infestatio, {1} n. 6663, hic a 
falsis, quia ab `Aegyptiis,' per quos significantur (d)scientifica falsa, n. 6651, 6679, 6683; et a significatione `populi' quod sint illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 2928; qui ab Ecclesia 
caelesti sunt, in Verbo vocantur `gens.' 	@1 i ut$ </p>
