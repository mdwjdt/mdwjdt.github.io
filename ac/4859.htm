<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4859节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4859.</strong>“蒙上帕子”表真理变得模糊。这从“蒙上”的含义清楚可知，“蒙上”，也就是用“帕子”蒙脸，是指隐藏，因而是指使被假冒为源于良善的真理变得模糊，如刚才所述（<a href="4858.htm">4858</a>节）。他玛这样做的目的是与犹大结合。因为当新娘第一次靠近新郎时，她会蒙上帕子或面纱，如我们读到利百加接近以撒时的情形（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.65.htm">24:65</a>）；以此表示真理的表象（<a href="3207.htm">3207</a>节）。因为“妻子”表示真理，“丈夫”表示良善；但由于真理在与其良善结合之前，并未实际显明它自己，所以为了代表这种实际情况，新娘在第一次见她的丈夫时，要蒙上帕子或面纱。此处他玛的情形与之类似，因为她视犹大的儿子示拉为她的丈夫。但由于示拉一直没有娶她，于是她便认为示拉的父亲应代替示拉尽丈夫弟兄的本分。因此，她像新娘，而非妓女那样蒙上帕子，尽管犹大以为是后者，因为那个时代，妓女也习惯蒙脸，这从15节经文明显看出来。犹大之所以把她看成是那种女人，是因为在那里由“犹大”所表示的犹太民族视代表性教会的内在真理如同低贱的妓女；因此，犹大与她结合，如同与一位妓女结合；但他玛结合与他结合却不是这样。由于这个民族无法以除此之外的任何其它方式看见内在真理，所以他玛“蒙上帕子”在此表示真理变得模糊。教会的真理向这个民族的成员变得模糊，这一事实也由如今他们在会堂用披肩或面纱遮盖自己来代表。<br />当摩西下西乃山时，他的面皮发光，以致他每当与百姓说话时都用帕子蒙上脸，这也代表类似的事（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28.htm">34:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.35.htm">35</a>）。摩西代表被称为律法的圣言（参看18章序言）；这就是为何经上有时说“律法和先知”（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.17.htm">5:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.13.htm">11:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.36.htm">22:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">40</a>）；有时说“摩西和众先知”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.29.htm">16:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.27.htm">24:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.44.htm">44</a>）。他的面皮发光代表圣言的内在，因为“面（或脸）”表示内在（<a href="358.htm">358</a>，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2434.htm">2434</a>，<a href="3527.htm">3527</a>，<a href="4066.htm">4066</a>，<a href="4796.htm">4796</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>节）；内在因是属灵的，故居于天堂之光。每当他与百姓说话时，便用帕子蒙上脸，这代表以下事实：内在真理向这个民族的成员遮盖，因而变得模糊，以致他们根本无法承认来自它的任何光芒。</p>

And covered herself in a veil. That this signifies truth obscured, is evident from the signification of "covering herself" or her face "with her veil," as being to conceal, and thus to obscure the truth 
which pretended to be from good, as just above (n. 4858); and this for the purpose of conjunction with Judah. For when a bride first approached the bridegroom she covered herself with a veil-as we 
read of Rebekah when she came to Isaac (Gen. 24:65); and by this were signified appearances of truth (n. 3207). For a wife signifies truth, and a husband good; and as truth does not appear in its quality 
until it is being conjoined with its good, therefore for the sake of representing this the bride covered herself with a veil on first seeing her husband. The case is similar here with Tamar, for 
she regarded Shelah Judah's son as her husband, but because she was not given to him, she regarded his father in his stead as one to perform the duty of a husband's brother. Therefore she covered herself 
with a veil as a bride, and not as a harlot, though Judah believed the latter because harlots also were wont at that time to cover their faces, as is evident from verse 15. The reason why Judah so 
regarded her was that the Jewish nation, which is there signified by "Judah," regarded the internal truths of the representative church no otherwise than as a harlot; and therefore Judah was conjoined 
with her as with a harlot, but not so Tamar with him. Because internal truths could not appear otherwise to that nation, therefore truth obscured is here signified by Tamar's covering herself in a veil. 
That the truth of the church is obscured to them, is represented also at this day by their covering themselves with veils in their synagogues. [2] There was a similar representation with Moses when 
the skin of his face shone as he came down from Mount Sinai, so that he covered himself with a veil whenever he spoke to the people (Exod. 34:28 to the end). Moses represented the Word which is called 
the Law (see the preface to Gen. 18); for which reason it is sometimes said the "Law and the Prophets" (as in Matt. 5:17; 11:13; 22:36, 40); and sometimes "Moses and the Prophets" (as in Luke 16:29, 
31; 24:27, 44). By the shining of the skin of his face was represented the internal of the Word, for the "face" is the internal (n. 358, 1999, 2434, 3527, 4066, 4796, 4797), which being spiritual 
is in the light of heaven. His veiling his face whenever he spoke to the people represented that internal truth was covered to them, and thus obscured so that they should not have to endure any light from it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4859</b></p><p><b>4859.</b>
'And covered herself with a veil' means the truth was rendered obscure. This is clear from the meaning of 'covering oneself (that is, covering one's face) with a veil' as concealing and so rendering 
obscure truth which pretended to spring from good, as immediately above in <a href="4858.htm">4858</a>. Tamar did this so that she might become joined to Judah. For when brides first approached their bridegrooms they used to 
cover themselves with a veil, as one reads of Rebekah doing when she came to Isaac, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:65&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24:65</a>, by which appearances of truth were meant, see <a href="3207.htm">3207</a>. 'A wife' means truth and 'a husband' good; but because 
truth as it really is does not show itself before it is joined to its good, therefore - to represent this reality - brides used to cover themselves with a veil when seen for the first time by their 
husbands. Here Tamar acted in a similar way, for she supposed that Shelah, Judah's son, should be her husband. But because she had not been given to him she then supposed that his father should perform 
the duty of a husband's brother instead. Therefore she covered herself with a veil as a bride would do. She did not cover herself as a whore would have done, though Judah supposed that this was what 
she was because in those times whores were likewise accustomed to cover their faces, as is evident from verse 15. The reason Judah supposed she was that kind of woman was that the Jewish nation, which 
is there meant by 'Judah', rated the internal truths of the representative Church as low as a whore. Therefore Judah was joined to her as though she were a whore; but Tamar's joining to him was not 
like that. Because internal truths could not be seen by that nation in any other way than this, the words used here 'she covered herself with a veil' therefore mean that truth was rendered obscure. 
The fact that the truth of the Church has been rendered obscure to members of that nation is also represented at the present day in their synagogues when they cover themselves with shawls or veils. </p>

Something similar was also represented by the skin on Moses' face shining when he came down from Mount Sinai, so that he covered himself with a veil every time he spoke to the people, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:28-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:28-end</a>. 
Moses represented the Word that is called the Law, see Preface to Chapter <a href="18.htm">18</a>; and that is why sometimes the expression 'the Law and the Prophets' is used, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:17;%2011:13;%2022:36,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:17; 11:13; 22:36, 40</a>, and 
sometimes 'Moses and the Prophets', as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:29,%2031;%2024:27,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:29, 31; 24:27, 44</a>. The skin shining on his face represented the inner reality of the Word, for 'the face' means that which is internal, <a href="358.htm">358</a>, <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2434.htm">2434</a>, <a href="3527.htm">3527</a>, <a href="4066.htm">4066</a>, <a href="4796.htm">4796</a>, <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>; for being spiritual, that inner reality dwells in the light of heaven. The veiling of his face every time he spoke to the people represented the fact that for members of that 
nation internal truth was covered and thus was rendered obscure so that they would not be exposed to any light at all from it. </p>

`Et obtexit in peplo': quod significet verum obscuratum, constat ex significatione `obtegere se seu facies peplo' quod sit abscondere et sic obscurare verum quod simulabat ex bono, ut mox supra n. 
4658; et hoc conjunctionis causa cum Jehudah; cum enim sponsae accedebant primum ad sponsum, obtegebant se peplo, ut legitur de Rebecca cum venit ad Jishakum, Gen. xxiv 65, per quod significata sunt 
apparentiae veri, videatur n. 3207; `uxor' enim significat verum et `maritus' bonum; et quia `cum non apparet quale est, priusquam conjungitur suo bono, ideo illius rei repraesentandae causa sponsae 
viso primum marito obtegebant se peplo; similiter hic Tamar, illa enim reputabat Shelam filium Jehudae ut suum maritum, sed quia non data fuit ei, loco ejus reputabat patrem ejus, qui leviratum 
praestaret; idcirco illa sicut sponsa obtexit se peplo, non autem sicut scortum, tametsi id Jehudah credidit, quia scorta pariter tunc temporis obtegere facies suas solebant, ut patet a vers. 15; 
quod Jehudah pro tali illam reputaret, erat quia gens Judaica quae per `Jehudam' ibi significatur, non aliter Ecclesiae repraesentativae vera interna reputabat quam sicut scortum, quapropter etiam 
Jehudah cum illa sicut cum scorto conjungebatur, non autem ita Tamar cum illo; </p>
<p>{1}quia vera interna genti illi nusquam aliter apparere potuerant, idcirco hic per quod `obtexit se peplo' significatur 
verum obscuratum, et quod verum Ecclesiae illis obscuratum sit, repraesentatur etiam hodie per quod velis seu peplis se obtegant {2}in suis.  Simile etiam repraesentatum est per Mosen, {3}Cum

<p>per
