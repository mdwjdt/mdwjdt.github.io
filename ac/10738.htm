<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10738节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10738</strong>.在说这些事之前，他们以为我们的团队也是由那些想以关于神的三位观念来混淆他们的人组成的。因此，听完这些话，他们说，神（他们现在称神为主）所差来的使者也来教导他们关于祂的事；但他们不愿让干扰他们的访客进来，尤其那些在神性上持三位格观念的人。因为他们知道，神是一，因此神性是一体，不是三者的一致，除非那些如此坚持的访客准备像思想一位天使那样思想神。也就是说，在这一位天使里面有一个不可见的生命至内在的层面，他在这个至内在层面上思考并变得智慧；他里面还有一个在一个人形式里面的生命外在层面，他在这个外在层面上观看和行动；他里面又有一个来自他自己的生命发出，也就是一个围绕他的爱和信的气场。因为凭从每个灵人或天使那里发出的生命气场，其爱和信的品质从远处就能被察觉出来。就主而言，他们说，来自祂的生命发出就是充满并构成天堂的神性本身，因为在爱和信的生命里面的本质存在来自祂。<br />听完这些话，我被引导说，关于三位同时又一位的这样一种观念与天使对主的观念是一致的，它来自主对于祂自己的亲自教导。因为祂教导说，父与祂为一；父在祂里面，祂在父里面；凡看见祂的，就看见了父；凡信祂的，也信父，并认识祂；还教导说，保惠师（祂称之为真理的灵，以及圣灵）从祂发出，并且不是出于祂自己，而是出于主说话，因此，祂表示神性发出。<br />我继续说，对三位同时又一位的这种观念与主在世时的生命存在和显现是一致的。祂生命的存在是神性本身，因为祂从耶和华成孕；每个人生命的存在都是他从中成孕的那一位。源于这存在的生命的显现是身体形式上的人身。每个人从他的父亲那里所获得的生命的存在被称为灵魂；源于这存在的生命的显现被称为身体；灵魂和身体构成一个完整的人。<br />这二者之间的关系类似于一项努力和由此产生的行为之间的关系。因为行为是付诸实施的努力，因此这二者为一。存在于一个人里面的努力被称为意愿，付诸实施的努力被称为行为。身体是使用它的意愿行动所用的工具；工具和它的使用者在行动中合二为一。灵魂和身体也是如此。<br />天上的天使对灵魂和身体就持有这样一种观念；他们从这种观念知道，主凭在祂里面的神性，也就是祂源于父的灵魂的能力将祂的人身变成神性。此外，在基督教界处处被接受的信仰与此无异，因为这信仰教导说：“正如身体与灵魂为一人，神与人在主里面也为一基督。”由于这就是主里面的合一或一体，所以祂不仅灵魂复活，而且与任何人不同的是，就祂在世时所荣耀的身体而言，祂也复活了。祂也教导了门徒这一点，当时祂说：<br />摸我看看！灵无肉无骨，你们看，我是有的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.39.htm">24:39</a>）<br />这解释了为何教会承认祂的人性全在于圣餐的圣礼中，这种承认是不可能的，除非祂的人身也是神性。这些灵人对这些事理解得很好，因为这些事在天使灵的理解范畴之内。他们还说，唯独主拥有天堂里的权柄，因为天堂是祂的。对此，我被引导回答说，教会也从主自己的口中知道这一点，祂在升天前说：<br />天上地上一切的权柄都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）</p>

Before these things were said, they had believed that our company also was one of those which desired to confuse them about God by the idea of three; and therefore after hearing these words, they said 
that some have been sent by God (whom they then called the Lord) to teach them about Him; and that they are not willing to admit visitors who disturb them, especially by means of three Persons in the 
Godhead, because they know that God is one, consequently that the Divine is one, and not a unanimity of three-unless their visitors are willing to think of God as of an angel, in whom there is an inmost 
of life that is invisible, and from which he thinks and is wise; and an external of life that is visible under the human form, and from which he sees and acts; and also a proceeding of life which 
is a sphere of love and faith around him. For from the sphere of life proceeding from him, the quality of every spirit and angel in respect to his love and faith is perceived at a distance. And in regard 
to the Lord they said that the proceeding sphere of life from Him is the Divine Itself that fills the heavens and makes them, because it is from the very Being of the life of love and of faith.  [2] 
After hearing these words it was given to say that such an idea about what is trine and at the same time one, is in agreement with the angelic idea about the Lord, and that it is from the very doctrine 
of the Lord about Himself, for He teaches that the Father and He are one, that the Father is in Him and He in the Father, that whoso seeth Him seeth the Father, and whoso believeth in Him believeth 
in the Father and knoweth Him, and also that the Paraclete, whom He calls the Spirit of truth and also the Holy Spirit, proceeds from Him and does not speak from Himself, but from Him, whereby is 
meant the Divine proceeding.  [3] And it was given to say, further, that an idea of what is trine and at the same time one is in agreement with the Being and Manifestation [Esse et Existere] of the 
life of the Lord when He was in the world. The Being of His life was the Divine Itself, for He was conceived of Jehovah; and the being of the life of everyone is that from whom he is conceived. The Manifestation 
of life from this Being is the Human in form. The being of the life of every man, which he has from his father, is called the soul; and the manifestation of life thence derived is called the 
body. The soul and the body constitute one man.  [4] The likeness between the two is like that between that which is in an endeavor and that which is in the consequent act; for an act is an endeavor 
acting, and thus these two are one. In man, endeavor is called "will;" and endeavor acting is called "action." The body is the instrumental by which the will, which is the principal, acts; and in acting 
the instrumental and the principal are together a one. And so it is with the soul and the body. The angels in heaven have such an idea about the soul and the body; and from this they know that the 
Lord made His Human Divine from the Divine in Himself, which was His soul from the Father. Moreover, the faith everywhere received in the Christian world does not dissent from this, for it teaches, 
"As the body and soul are one man, so also in the Lord, God and Man are one Christ."  [5] As such was the union, or such the one, in the Lord, He therefore rose again not only as to the soul; but, differently 
from any man, as to the body which He glorified in the world. He also instructed the disciples about this, saying, "Feel Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me have." 
 [6] From this it is that the church acknowledges the omnipresence of His Human in the Sacrament of the Supper, which could not be acknowledged unless His Human also was Divine. These things were well 
understood by these spirits; for such things fall into the understanding of angelic spirits; and they said that the Lord alone has power in the heavens, and that the heavens are His. To this it was 
given to reply that the church also knows this from the mouth of the Lord Himself before He ascended into heaven, for He then said, "All power has been given to Me in heaven and on earth." </p>

Before these things had been said they had supposed that our group as well had consisted of those who wished to confuse them with the idea of three regarding God. Consequently, having heard these things, 
they said that emissaries from God - whom they would now call the Lord - had also come and taught them about Him, but that they refused entrance to the visitors who disturb them, especially those 
with ideas of three persons in the Godhead. For they know that God is one and therefore that the Godhead is a oneness, not the unanimity of three, unless those who so insist are prepared to think of 
God as an angel may be thought of. That is, within an angel there is an inmost, invisible level of life, on which he thinks and is wise; an outward level of life visible in a human form, on which he sees 
and acts; and an emanation of life from himself, which is a sphere of love and faith surrounding him. For what the love and faith of each spirit or angel are like is recognized at a distance from 
the sphere of life emanating from him. In the Lord's case, they said, the emanation of life from Him consists in the Divine itself which fills and constitutes the heavens, because the Essential Being 
(Esse) within the life of love and faith is from Him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Having heard all this I was led to say that such an idea of three and at the same time of one is in keeping with the angelic idea of the Lord, 
and that it arises out of the Lord's very own teachings about Himself. For He teaches that the Father and He are one; that the Father is in Him and He is in the Father; that whoever sees Him sees 
the Father, and whoever believes in Him believes in the Father and knows Him; also that the Paraclete, whom He calls the Spirit of truth as well as the Holy Spirit, goes forth from Him and speaks not 
of His own accord but of the Lord's, so that by Him is meant the Divine going forth. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And I went on to say that an idea of three and at the same time of one was in keeping with the Essential Being 
and the Coming-into-being (Esse et Existere) of the Lord's life when He was in the world. The Essential Being of His life was the Divine itself, since He was conceived from Jehovah and the essential 
being of anyone's life is what he is conceived from; the Coming-into-being of life, springing from that Essential Being, is the Human in [bodily] form. The essential being of anyone's life which the person 
has from his father is called the soul, and the coming-into-being of life from that essential being is called the body, the soul and the body constituting one complete human being. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The relationship 
between them both is similar to the relationship between what lies in an endeavour and what lies in an action resulting from it. For the action is the endeavour put into effect, so that the two 
are one. The endeavour as it exists in a person is called the will, and the endeavour put into effect is called the action. The body is the instrument by which the will that employs it performs an action, 
and in the performance of it the instrument and the employer of it come together as one. So it is with soul and body. </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 An idea of soul and body such as this is what angels in heaven have, and 
from that idea they know that the Lord made His Human Divine by the power of the Divine within Him, which was His soul derived from the Father. The faith accepted everywhere in the Christian world is 
no different from this, for that faith teaches,  </p>
<p>As the body and soul are one man (homo), so also God and man (homo) in the Lord is one Christ.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>  </p>
<p>Since the unity or oneness in the Lord was such, 
He rose again not just as to His soul but also, unlike anyone else, as to His body which He had glorified in the world. This too He taught the disciples, when He said,  </p>
<p>Handle Me and see; for a 
spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have. [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:39</a>.]  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 This explains why the Church acknowledges the whole presence of His Humanity within the sacrament of the Holy Supper, which 
acknowledgement would not be possible unless His Human also were Divine. </p>
<p>These matters were well understood by those spirits, for such matters fall within angelic spirits' range of understanding. 
They also said that to the Lord alone belongs power in the heavens and that the heavens are His. In response to this I was led to say that the Church knows that too from the mouth of the Lord Himself, 
who said before He went up to heaven,  </p>
<p>All power in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18</a>.]

Antequam haec dicta sunt, crediderunt quod etiam noster comitatus esset inter illos qui vellent confundere eos per ideam trium de Deo; quapropter his auditis dicebant quod a Deo, Quem tunc vocabant 
Dominum, etiam missi sint qui docent eos de Ipso, et quod non velint admittere advenas qui perturbant eos, imprimis per tres personas in Divinitate; quoniam sciunt quod Deus anus sit, proinde quod Divinum 
unum et non ex tribus unanimum, nisi velint cogitare de Deo sicut de angelo, in quo intimum vitae est quod invisibile ex quo cogitat et sapit, et externum vitae quod visibile sub humana forma, ex 
quo videt et agit; et procedens vitae, quod est sphaera amoris et fidei circum illum, nam unusquisque spiritus et angelus ex sphaera vitae procedentis ex illo percipitur ad distantiam qualis est quoad 
amorem et fidem; et quoad Dominum, quod ab Ipso procedens vitae sit ipsum Divinum quod implet caelos et facit illos, quia est ex Ipso Esse vitae {1}amoris et fidei. 	[2] His auditis dicere dabatur 
quod talis idea {2}de trino et simul uno concordet cum idea angelica de Domino, et quod {3}sit ex ipsa doctrina Domini de Se Ipso, nam docet quod Pater et Ipse unum sint, quod Pater in Ipso et Ipse in 
Patre, quod qui videt Ipsum videat Patrem, ac qui credit in Ipsum credat in Patrem et cognoscat Illum, tum quod Paracletus, quem vocat Spiritum veritatis, ut et Spiritum Sanctum, procedat ab Ipso, et 
non loquatur a Se sed ab Ipso, per quem intelligitur Divinum procedens; [3] et porro, quod idea {2}de trino et simul uno concordet cum Esse et Existere vitae Domini cum fuit in mundo; Esse vitae Ipsius 
fuit ipsum Divinum, nam conceptus est a Jehovah, et esse vitae cujusvis est a quo concipitur; Existere vitae ex illo Esse est Humanum in forma; esse vitae cujusvis hominis, quod ei a patre, vocatur 
anima, et existere vitae inde vocatur corpus; anima et corpus unum hominem {4}constituunt; [4] similitudo inter utrumque est sicut inter id quod est in conatu et quod est in actu inde, est enim actus 
conatus agens, et sic duo unum; conatus in homine vocatur voluntas, et conatus agens vocatur actio; corpus est instrumentale per quod voluntas quae est principale agit, ac instrumentale et principale 
in agendo simul anum sunt; ita anima et corpus; talem ideam de anima et corpore habent angeli in caelo; inde sciunt quod Dominus Humanum Suum fecerit Divinum ex Divino in Se, quod fuit Ipsi anima ex 
Patre.  Fides etiam recepta ubivis in Christiano orbe nec dissentit, nam illa docet, 	{5}Sicut corpus et anima sunt unus homo, ita etiam Deus et homo {6}in Domino est unus Christus. (Symbolum Athanasii.) 	[5] 
Quia talis unio fuit, seu tale unum in Domino, ideo {7} non modo quoad animam sed etiam quoad corpus, quod in mundo glorificavit, resurrexit, secus ac ullus homo; de quo etiam instruit {8} 
discipulos, {9}dicens, 	Palpate Me et videte, nam spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut Me videtis habere, (Luc. xxiv 39.) 	[6] Inde est quod Ecclesia {10} agnoscat omnipraesentiam Humani Ipsius in 
Sacramento Cenae, quod non potest agnosci nisi Humanum Ipsius etiam esset Divinum.  Haec bene intellexerunt spiritus illi, nam talia cadunt in {11}intellectum spirituum angelicorum, et dixerunt {12} 
quod soli Domino sit potestas in caelis,et quod caeli sint Ipsius; ad quae {13}respondere datum est quod etiam id sciat Ecclesia {13} ex Ipsius Domini ore antequam ascendit in caelum, dixit enim tunc, 	Data
