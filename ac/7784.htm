<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7784节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7784.</strong>“至于所有以色列人，连狗也不摇舌”表在那些属于属灵教会的人当中不会有一丝诅咒或悲痛的痕迹。这从“以色列人”的代表和“狗也不摇舌”的含义清楚可知：“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>，<a href="6862.htm">6862</a>，<a href="6868.htm">6868</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7062.htm">7062</a>，<a href="7198.htm">7198</a>，<a href="7201.htm">7201</a>，<a href="7215.htm">7215</a>，<a href="7223.htm">7223</a>节）；“狗也不摇舌”是指不会有一丝诅咒或悲痛的痕迹。因为这句话表达的是表示深深悲痛的“埃及地的大哀号”（<a href="7782.htm">7782</a>节）的反面，这种深深的悲痛是由于长子死亡所表示的诅咒。<br />那些属于属灵教会的人，也就是那些处于该教会的良善之人没有一丝诅咒，意思是说他们没有任何邪恶；相反，主使他们远离邪恶，将他们保守在良善中。属于他们自己的东西完全是邪恶，并受到诅咒；而属于主自己并为他们所接受的东西是良善，因而摆脱了一切诅咒。这就是我们说那些住在主里面的人根本没有任何诅咒的意思。<br />经上说“狗不摇舌”是由于“狗”的含义。“狗”表示教会中最低级的人，也就是价值低的卑微之人，以及教会之外的人，还表示那些对教会事物夸夸其谈，却不怎么理解的人；在反面意义上则表示那些完全在教会的信之外，傲慢无礼地对待信之事物的人。“狗”表示那些在教会之外的人，这一点明显可见于马太福音：<br />耶稣对希腊妇人，一个西罗腓尼基人说，不好拿儿女的饼，丢给狗吃。妇人说，主啊，是的。但是小狗也吃它们主人桌子上掉下来的碎渣儿。耶稣回答她说，妇人，你的信心是大的。照你所要的，给你成全了吧。她女儿就痊愈了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.26.htm">15:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.28.htm">28</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.27.htm">7:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.28.htm">28</a>）<br />此处“儿女”表示那些在教会之内的人，“狗”表示那些在教会之外的人。舔拉撒路疮的狗（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.21.htm">16:21</a>）所表相同；因为在那里，“财主”在内义上表示那些在教会里面，因而富有属灵财富的人，这些财富就是关于真理和良善的知识。<br />在以下经文中，“狗”表示那些在教会里地位最低，对教会事物夸夸其谈，却不怎么理解的人，在反面意义上表示那些傲慢无礼地对待信之事物的人：<br />祂的守望人都是瞎眼的，他们都没有知识，都是哑巴狗，不能叫唤；只会观望、躺卧、贪睡。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.10.htm">56:10</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他们叫号如狗，围城绕行。他们口中喷吐恶言，嘴里有剑。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.6.htm">59:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.14.htm">14</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />你的脚踹在血中，使你狗的舌头……（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.23.htm">68:23</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />不要把圣物给狗，也不要把你们的珍珠丢在猪前，恐怕它们把它们践踏在脚下，转过来咬你们。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.6.htm">7:6</a>）<br />这就是为何“死狗”（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上24.14.htm">24:14</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下9.8.htm">9:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下16.9.htm">16:9</a>）表示要被丢弃的所有最劣质的事物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7784</b></p><p><b>7784.</b>
And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue. That this signifies that among those who are of the spiritual church there shall not be the least of damnation and lamentation, is evident 
from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223); and from the signification of "a dog not 
moving his tongue," as being that there shall not be the least of damnation and lamentation; for this statement is opposed to the "great cry which shall be in the land of Egypt," which denotes interior 
lamentation (n. 7782), and this on account of the damnation signified by the death of the firstborn. [2] By those who are of the spiritual church (that is, who are in the good of this church) not 
having the least of damnation, is not to be understood that they are devoid of all evil; but that they are withheld from evil in good by the Lord. That which is their own is nothing but what is evil 
and damned; but that which is the Lord's own and which they receive is good, consequently is devoid of all damnation. Thus it is meant that there is nothing of damnation with those who are in the Lord. [3] 
Its being said that "a dog shall not move his tongue" is on account of the signification of a "dog." A "dog" signifies the lowest of all, or those who are of small value in the church, likewise 
those who are outside of the church, also those who prate much about the things of the church and understand little; and in the opposite sense, those who are altogether outside of the faith of the church 
and treat with contumely the things of faith. That "dogs" signify those who are outside of the church, is evident in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said unto the Greek woman, a Syrophoenician, It is not good 
to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. But she said, Surely Lord; but even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. Then Jesus answering said unto her, 
O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee as thou wilt; and her daughter* was healed (Matt. 15:26-28; Mark 7:27-28); </p>
<p>where by "children" are meant those who are within the church, and by "dogs" 
those who are outside of it. In like manner by the "dogs which licked the sores of Lazarus" (Luke 16:21); for by the "rich man" there, in the internal sense, is meant one who is within the church and 
consequently abounds spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good. "Dogs" denote those who are in the lowest place within the church, who prate much about the things of the church and 
understand little, and in the opposite sense, those who treat with contumely the things of faith, in these passages: </p>
<p>     His watchmen are all blind, they do not know; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot 
bark; looking on, lying down, loving to sleep (Isa. 56:10).      They are noisy like a dog, they go round about in the city; for they belch with their mouth; swords are in their lips (Ps. 59:6-7, 
14).      That thy foot may stamp in blood, the tongue of thy dogs . . . (Ps. 68:23).      Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample 
them with their feet, and turn and rend you (Matt. 7:6). For this reason the vilest of all things, which was to be cast away, is signified by a "dead dog" (1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 9:8; 16:9). * The 
Latin has "the woman." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7784</b></p><p><b>7784.</b>
'And against all the children of Israel not a dog will move its tongue' means that with those belonging to the spiritual Church there would not be the smallest trace of damnation or grief. This is clear 
from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>, <a href="6862.htm">6862</a>, <a href="6868.htm">6868</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7062.htm">7062</a>, <a href="7198.htm">7198</a>, <a href="7201.htm">7201</a>, <a href="7215.htm">7215</a>, <a href="7227.htm">7227</a>; and from the meaning of 'not 
a dog moving its tongue' as there being not the smallest trace of damnation or grief. For these words express the opposite of 'a great cry which there will be in the land of Egypt', that is, deep 
grief, <a href="7782.htm">7782</a> - deep grief on account of damnation, meant by the death of the firstborn. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When it is said that there will not be the smallest trace of damnation with those who belong to the spiritual 
Church, that is, with those governed by the good of that Church, this should not be taken to mean that they are without any evil, but that they are withheld from evil and maintained in good by the 
Lord. What is properly their own is altogether evil and damned, but what is properly the Lord's which they receive is good and so is free from all damnation. This is the meaning when it is said that 
there is no damnation at all with those who abide in the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The expression 'not a dog will move its tongue' is used on account of the meaning that 'a dog' has. 'A dog' means the lowest of all 
within the Church, that is, the mean and lowly, as well as those outside the Church, and also those who blather a lot about things that have to do with the Church and have little understanding of 
them. And in the contrary sense it means those who are altogether outside the faith of the Church and who subject matters of faith to abuse. The fact that 'dogs' means those outside the Church is clear 
in Matthew, </p>
<p>Jesus said to the woman who was Greek, a Syro-Phoenician, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs. But she said, To be sure, Lord, but even the little dogs 
eat from the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2015:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 15:26-28</a>; 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%207:27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 7:27, 28</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'children' is used to mean those within the Church, and 'dogs' those outside it. Much the same is meant by the dogs that licked Lazarus sores, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:21</a>; for 'the rich man' there 
is used to mean in the internal sense those who are within the Church and who consequently have an abundance of spiritual riches, which consist in knowledge of what is true and good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'Dogs' 
stands for those occupying the lowest position within the Church who blather a lot about such things as have to do with the Church but have little understanding of them, and in the contrary sense those 
who hurl insults at the things which are matters of faith, in Isaiah, </p>
<p>His watchmen are all blind, they are without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark - watching, lying down, loving 
to sleep. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2056:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 56:10</a>. </p>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
They make a noise like a dog, they go around in the city; for they belch with their mouth, swords are in their lips. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2059:6,%207,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 59:6, 7, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
That 
your foot may press into blood the tongue of your dogs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do not cast your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample on them 
with their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is why the most inferior of all things, which was to be cast away, is meant by 'a dead dog' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2024:14;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 24:14; 2</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%209:8;%2016:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 9:8; 16:9</a>. </p>
