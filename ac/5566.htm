<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5566节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5566.</strong>有一个灵人向我走来，他看上去就像一团乌云，周围有流星。在来世，当流星出现时，它们表示虚假；但牢固的星星表示真理。我注意到这就是那个想接近我的灵人；他靠近时，使我感到恐惧；这种灵人，尤其强盗就有这种能力。正是这种恐惧使我断定他曾是个强盗。当他靠近我时，利用巫术千方百计侵扰我，但没有得逞。他伸出手来行使他自以为所拥有的能力，但毫无效果。此后，他脸的样子被指给我看。他并没有脸，取而代之的是某种非常黑的东西；上面露出一张嘴，以一种可怕而凶猛的方式大大张开，以致它就是一个无底洞，里面有一排排的牙齿。简言之，它就像一只张大嘴巴的疯狗，并且嘴巴张得如此之大，以致它只有一张敞开的大嘴巴，没有脸。</p>

There came toward me one who appeared like a black cloud about which were shooting stars. When shooting stars appear in the other life they signify falsities; but fixed stars signify truths. I perceived 
that it was a spirit who wished to approach. When he came near he struck me with fear; this certain spirits can do, especially robbers, and therefore I was able to conclude that he had been a robber. 
When he was near me, he made every effort to infest me by magic arts, but in vain. He stretched out his hand that he might exert his imaginary power, but with no effect whatever. The kind of face 
he had was afterward shown. It was no face, but something very black in place of one; and in it appeared a mouth gaping so dreadfully and ferociously that it was a very maw in which teeth were set in 
rows. In a word, it was like a mad dog with distended jaws, so that it was a wide open mouth, not a face. </p>

As a certain spirit came towards me I saw what looked like a black cloud that had stars around it which were wavering. Falsities are meant when stars that are wavering appear in the next life, but truths 
when those that are firmly fixed appear there. I noticed that this was a spirit who wanted to get near me; and when he did so he struck fear into me, an ability that certain spirits, especially robbers, 
possess. It was that fear which led me to deduce that he was a robber. While he was near me he sought to do all he could with the aid of magical devices to disturb me, but without success. He 
stretched out his hand to exercise the power he imagined himself to possess, but that action achieved absolutely nothing. After that I was shown what his face was like. He had no face but instead something 
very black, where a mouth appeared, opened wide in a dreadful and fierce manner to produce gaping jaws in which a row of teeth stood out. In short it was like a mad dog with its jaws opened wide, 
so wide that it had jaws but no face. </p>

Quidam ad me venit, apparuit sicut nubes nigra circa quam stellae vacillantes; stellae vacillantes in altera vita cum apparent, significant falsa, sed stellae fixae vera; appercepi quod spiritus esset 
qui accedere voluit; cum accessit, timorem incussit; hoc possunt quidam spiritus, imprimis latrones; ex eo {1} concludere potui quod latro fuerit; {2}is cum prope me erat, {3}volebat me omni conatu 
infestare per artificia magica sed incassum; extendebat manum ut exerceret potentiam imaginariam sed id prorsus nihil effecit.  Ostensum dein quali facie esset; facies nulla erat sed nigerrimum quid 
loco ejus, et ibi apparuit os dire et ferociter diductum sic ut esset ingluvies, in qua exstabant dentes in serie; verbo erat sicut canis rabidus diducto rictu, {4}adeo ut rictus esset non facies. @1
