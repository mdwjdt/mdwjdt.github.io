<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8020节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8020.</strong>从本章所论述的关于吃逾越节的羔羊的条例和律法可以清楚地看出，每个细节都包含并隐藏着天上的奥秘，若没有从内义所获得的知识，人只能看见纯外在形式上的仪式，丝毫看不见天堂之物，更看不见神性。例如：为何逾越节的动物须是一只羔羊或小山羊；为何这个动物须是一只公的，是“一岁的儿子”；为何它要在正月十四日被宰杀；为何要把它的血洒在门框和门楣上；为何要用火烤了了，就着苦菜与无酵饼一同吃，还不可吃生的，或用水煮的；为何要烤它的腿和中部上的头；为何他们不可剩下一点留到早晨，又为何若留到早晨，要用火烧了；为何他们要吃无酵饼七日，又为何凡吃有酵之物的必剪除；为何外邦人、外人和雇工都不可吃，但各人用银子买的奴仆，以及寄居的，若受了割礼就可以吃；为何要在一个房子里吃，不可把一点肉带到门外去；为何羔羊的骨头一根也不可折断。人们完全不知道这些和其它许多要求包含什么，经上又为何吩咐它们，除非人们知道它们所对应的灵界中的秩序律法，并从内义知道每个细节在灵界，也就是在天堂表示什么；尤其相信它们全都包含某种属灵事物。若非每一个细节都包含某种属灵事物，那么当人阅读圣言时，与人同在的天使只理解一点点圣言，事实上几乎一点也不理解；因为天使以属灵的方式来理解圣言中以属世方式所描述的一切事物。</p>

From the statutes and laws concerning the eating of the paschal lamb, which are treated of in this chapter, it is clearly evident that there are heavenly secrets contained and hidden in every detail, 
and that without knowledge from the internal sense nothing is known but a mere ritual in an external form, and nothing heavenly, still less Divine. As for instance, why the paschal animal was to be a 
lamb or a kid; why the animal was to be a male, and a son of a year; why it was to be killed on the fourteenth day of the month; why its blood was to be sprinkled upon the posts and the lintel; why it 
was to be eaten roasted with fire, with unleavened bread upon bitter herbs, and not raw or boiled in water; why it was to be roasted with its head upon its legs and upon its midst; why they were not 
to leave anything of it until the morning, and why that which was left was to be burned with fire; why they were to eat unleavened bread seven days, and why whosoever ate leavened bread was to be cut 
off; why an alien, a lodger, and a hireling were not to eat of it, but a man's servant that is bought with silver, and a sojourner, if they were circumcised; why it was to be eaten in one house, and 
none of the flesh taken out of doors; why a bone was not to be broken in it. What these and very many other particulars involve, and why they were commanded, would be utterly unknown, unless the laws 
of order in the spiritual world to which they correspond, were known, and unless it were known from the internal sense what each detail signifies in that world, that is, in heaven; and especially unless 
it were believed that in all things there is something spiritual. If there were not something spiritual in the whole and in each detail, the angels who are with man when he reads the Word would comprehend 
but little, indeed scarcely anything, from the Word; for the angels comprehend spiritually all things that have been described in the Word in a natural manner. </p>

It is plainly evident from the statutes and laws regarding the eating of the Passover lamb which appear in this chapter that in every detail they contain and conceal heavenly arcana, and that without 
knowledge gained from the internal sense one can see no more in them than the outward form of a religious custom, and nothing heavenly, let alone Divine. Without that knowledge one does not know the 
reason for any of the following: Why the Passover animal was to be a lamb or a kid; why the animal was to be a male, and 'the son of a year'; why it was to be slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the 
month; why the blood from it was to be sprinkled on the doorposts and lintel; why it was to be eaten roasted with fire, together with unleavened bread on bitter herbs, and not any of it raw or boiled 
in water; why its head was to be roasted over its legs and over its middle; why none of it was to be left till morning, and why what remained was to be burned with fire; why they were to eat unleavened 
bread for seven days, and why anyone eating anything made with yeast was to be cut off; why the foreigner, the stranger, and the hired servant could not eat it, but a man's slave, a purchase paid for 
with silver, and a sojourner, could eat it if they were circumcised; why it was to be eaten in one house and none of the flesh was to be brought outside; and why no bone of it was to be broken. What 
these and very many other regulations hold within them, and why they were commanded, would remain completely unknown unless the laws of order in the spiritual world to which they correspond were known, 
unless knowledge were acquired from the internal sense of what each regulation means in that world, that is, in heaven, and in particular unless the belief existed that all of them contain a spiritual 
level of meaning. Unless every single one contained this spiritual level of meaning the angels present with a person would understand little or scarcely anything of the Word when read by the person; 
for all the things which have been described in the Word in a natural way are understood by the angels on a spiritual level of meaning.  </p>

x). Ex statutis et legibus de esu agni paschalis, de quibus in hoc capite, {1}manifeste patet quod arcana (x)caelestia sint quae continentur (c)et reconduntur in singulis, et quod absque cognitione ex 
sensu interno nihil sciatur quam mere rituale in forma externa, ac nihil caeleste, {2}minus Divinum; sicut, cur pecus paschalis (t)esset agnus vel haedus: cur pecus mascula esset et filius anni: cur 
mactaretur quartodecimo die mensis: cur sanguis inde spargeretur super postes et superliminare {3}: cur comederetur assa igne cum azymis super amaroribus, et non de illa crudum aut coctum in aquis: cur 
assaretur caput super cruribus et super medio ejus: cur nihil de illa relinqueretur ad mane, et cur relictum combureretur igne: cur azyma comederent septem diebus, et cur exscinderetur comedens fermentatum: 
cur alienigena, inquilinus, et mercenarius non comederent illud, sed servus viri emptio argenti, ac peregrinus, si circumciderentur: cur in una domo comederetur nec educeretur de carne foras: 
cur os non frangeretur in illa; quid haec et perplura {4}alia involvunt, et cur mandata sunt, prorsus ignoraretur nisi sciantur leges ordinis in spirituali mundo quibus correspondent, et nisi ex sensu 
interno sciatur quid singula in illo mundo, hoc est, in caelo, significant, et imprimis nisi credatur quod in omnibus insit spirituale; {5} nisi inesset omnibus et singulis spirituale, {6}angeli qui 
apud hominem, cum ab homine legitur, parum et vix aliquid ex Verbo, comprehenderent, nam angeli omnia quae in Verbo (x)naturali modo descripta sunt comprehendunt spiritualiter. 	@1 constare potest$ 	@2
