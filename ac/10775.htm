<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10775节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10775</strong>.那些出于世俗事物思想神圣天意的人基于这些事物得出这样的结论：它只以一种总体的方式进行运作，而细节则留给个人。但这些人并不知道天堂的奥秘，因为他们仅仅根据对自己和世界的爱及其快乐而得出自己的结论。因此，当他们看到被提升到重要地位、获得财富的，不是好人，而是坏人，又看到坏人的图谋得逞时，心里就会说，如果神圣的天意真的存在于每一件事中，这种情况就不会发生。但这些人没有想到，神圣的天意并不关注转瞬即逝、随着人在世上的生命结束而结束之物，而是关注存到永远，因而不会结束之物。凡不会结束之物都有真实的存在；而相比之下，凡会结束之物则缺乏真实的存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10775</b></p><p><b>10775.</b>
Those who think about the Divine Providence from worldly things, conclude from these that it is only universal, and that the singulars appertain to man. But these persons are not acquainted with the 
arcana of heaven, for they form their conclusions solely from the loves of self and of the world and their pleasures; and therefore when they see the evil exalted to honors, and gaining wealth rather 
than the good; and also that the evil succeed in accordance with their skill, they say in their hearts that it would not be so if the Divine Providence were in each and all things. But these persons do 
not consider that the Divine Providence does not look to that which is fleeting and transitory, and which comes to an end together with the life of man in the world; but that it looks to that which 
remains to eternity, thus which has no end. That which has no end is; but that which has an end, relatively is not. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10775</b></p><p><b>10775.</b>
Those whose thought about Divine Providence stems from worldly considerations conclude on the basis of these that it operates in merely a general way and that details are left to the individual. But 
they do not know the arcana of heaven; for nothing other than self-love and love of the world, and the pleasures associated with these, govern them in the conclusions they draw. Consequently when they 
see bad people rather than good being raised to important positions and acquiring wealth, and also see that the designs of bad people meet with success, they say in their heart that none of this would 
happen if Divine Providence were in fact present within every single thing. But they do not take into consideration the truth that Divine Providence does not regard that which is brief and transient 
and comes to an end with a person's life in the world; rather it regards that which remains forever and so does not come to an end. That which does not come to an end has real existence, whereas that 
which does come to an end, in comparison, lacks it.  </p>

</p><b>10775.</b>
Qui ex mundanis cogitant de Providentia Divina, concludunt ex illis quod illa sit modo universalis, et quod singularia sint apud hominem; sed illi non sciunt arcana caeli, concludunt enim solum ex amoribus 
sui et mundi et eorum voluptatibus; quare cum vident malos efferri ad honores et lucrari opes prae bonis, et quoque malis succedere secundum artes, corde suo dicunt quod non ita fieret si Divina 
Providentia esset in omnibus et singulis; sed illi non considerant quod Providentia Divina non spectet id quod brevi transit, et finem cum vita hominis in mundo habet, sed quod spectet id quod in aeternum 
manet, ita quod non finem habet; quod non finem habet, id Est, quod autem finem habet, id respective non Est. </p>
