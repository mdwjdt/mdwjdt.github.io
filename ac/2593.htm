<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2593.</strong>我还被允许与古代那些比其他人更有智慧的人交谈。一开始，他们显现在我前方，有一定距离。在那里，他们能洞察我思想的内层。这意味着他们能将我完全看透，从我一个小小的念头，他们能看出一连串的思想活动，并赋之以智慧和令人愉悦的表现形式的快乐。由此可见，他们乃是智者中的智者。我被告知，他们来自上古时代。此时，他们走近我。我给他们读圣言，他们感到至为快乐。我被允许察觉他们的喜乐，这喜乐尤其源于以下事实：他们从圣言听到的每一个细节都是属天和属灵之物的代表和象征。他们说，在其生活于世的那个年代，人们思想、言说乃至写作的模式都具有这种性质，这是其智慧的追求。</p>

I have also been permitted to speak with others who lived in ancient times and who were then among the more wise. They were at first seen in front at a distance, and were there able to perceive the interiors 
of my thoughts, thus many things in a thorough manner. From one idea of the thought they could know the entire series, and fill it with delightful things of wisdom together with pleasing representations, 
which showed me that they were among the more wise, and I was told that they were from the Ancients. So they drew nearer, and when I read to them something from the Word they were most highly 
delighted. It was granted me to perceive their very delight and enjoyment, which arose chiefly from the fact that all the things they heard from the Word were both in general and in particular representative 
and significative of heavenly and spiritual things. They said that in their time when they lived in the world their mode of thinking and speaking, and also of writing, was of this nature, 
and that this was their wisdom's study. </p>

I have also been allowed to talk to others who lived in ancient times and who in those times belonged among those with more wisdom than others. First I saw them at a distance in a forward position, and 
while there they were able to discern the more interior aspects of my thoughts, thus many things completely. From a single idea present in my thought they were able to know a whole sequence and to 
fill it with the delights of wisdom together with lovely representations. From this I perceived that they belonged among those with more wisdom, and I was told that they were some of the Ancients. So 
they then drew nearer, and when I read to them something from the Word they were supremely delighted. I was given to perceive their delight and joy itself, which stemmed mainly from the fact that every 
single detail which they heard from the Word was a representative of and a meaningful sign of celestial and spiritual things. They said that during the time they lived in the world their manner of thought 
and speech and also of writing was of this nature, and that in such had lain their pursuit of wisdom. </p>

</p><b>2593.</b>
Loqui etiam datum est cum aliis, qui antiquis temporibus vixerunt et qui tunc inter sapientiores fuerunt; visi primum antrorsum ad distantiam ac ibi potuerant appercipere interiora cogitationum mearum, 
ita plura pleni ex una idea cogitationis potuerunt scire integram seriem, et illam delectabilibus sapientiae cum repraesentationibus amoenis implere; inde perceptum quo inter sapientiores essent, 
et dictum quod ab antiquis; ac ita propius accesserunt, cumque tunc praelegerem illis aliquid ex Verbo, summopere delectati sunt; ipsam delectationem et jucunditatem eorum percipere dabatur, quae maxime 
inde erat quod omnia et singula quae audiebant ex Verbo, caelestium et spiritualium repraesentativa et significativa essent; dicebant quod suo tempore cum in mundo vixerunt, modus eorum cogitandi et 
loquendi, tum quoque scribendi, talis fuerit, et quod hoc sapientiae eorum studium. </p>
