<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2025节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2025.</strong>“我要将你现在寄居的地赐给你和随从你的你的种”表主凭能力为自己获得的“你寄居的地”所表示的一切事物。这从“寄居”的含义清楚可知，“寄居”是指接受教导（参看<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>节）。人主要通过记忆知识、教义和信的认知方面的教导为自己获得生命，所以寄居是指如此获得的生命。当用于主时，“寄居”是指主通过认知、试探的争战和试探中的胜利为自己获得的生命。因祂凭自己的能力获得它，故这就是此处“你寄居的地”所表示的。<br />主凭自己的能力为自己获得一切事物，并凭自己的能力将人性本质联结于神性本质、将神性本质联结于人性本质。唯独祂以这种方式成为公义，这一点明显可见于先知书。如以赛亚书：<br />这从以东来，装扮华美、能力广大、大步行走的是谁呢？我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在。我四周张望，见无人帮助；我诧异，没有人扶持。所以我自己的膀臂为我施行拯救。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“以东”表主的人性本质，“能力”和“膀臂”表能力。经上清楚说明祂凭自己的权力行事，因为“无人帮助”、“没有人扶持”、“祂自己的膀臂为祂施行拯救”。<br />同一先知书：<br />祂见无人，无人代求，甚为诧异；祂自己的膀臂就给祂施拯救，祂自己的公义就扶持祂。祂以公义为护胸甲，以拯救为头盔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">59:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.17.htm">17</a>）<br />这同样表祂凭自己的能力行事，并由此成为公义。主就是公义，这在但以理书中有所阐述：<br />已经定了七十个七，要赎尽罪孽，引进永义，封住异象和预言，并膏至圣所。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.24.htm">9:24</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；祂必掌王权，行事有智慧，在地上施行公平和公义。在祂的日子，犹大必得救，以色列也安然居住。这就是他们要称呼祂的名，耶和华我们的义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />为此，祂还被称为“公义的居所”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.23.htm">31:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.7.htm">50:7</a>）、“奇妙”和“勇士”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）。<br />主经常将祂自己的东西归于父，其原因前面已解释过（<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>节）；因为耶和华在祂里面，并因此在祂的一切事物里面。人里面的类似事物尽管没有可比性，但也有助于说明这一点。人的灵魂在他里面，并且灵魂因在他里面，故也在他的各个部分里面，也就是说，在其思维的各个部分和其行为的各个部分里面。凡其中没有他的灵魂之物都不是他的。主的灵魂就是生命本身，或存在本身，也就是耶和华，因为祂从耶和华成孕。因此，耶和华或生命本身就在祂的各个部分中。生命本身或存在本身，也就是耶和华属于祂的方式，和灵魂属于人的方式是一样的。故耶和华的就是祂的，也就是主在其声明中所说的这些话：祂在“父怀里”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>），“凡父所有的，都是祂的”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">16:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">17:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.11.htm">11</a>）。<br />祂通过耶和华的良善将神性本质联结于人性本质，通过真理将人性本质联结于神性本质，因而凭自己成就一切事，无论总体还是细节。事实上，祂的人性交由它自己，是为了祂能凭自己与所有地狱争战并战胜它们。<br />祂在自己有生命，这生命是祂自己的（如前所述），故祂凭自己的能力和力量战胜它们，这也清楚可见于从先知书中所引用的经文。结果，祂因凭自己的能力为自己获得一切事物，故成为公义，将地狱魔鬼和恶灵清除出灵人界，从而将人类从毁灭中解救出来（因为人类藉着灵人被统治），因而救赎人类。为此，祂在旧约经常被称作拯救者、救世主和救主，救主也是祂的耶稣之名的含义。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2025</b></p><p><b>2025.</b>
I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings. That this signifies that the Lord acquired to Himself all things by His own forces or powers, which are "the land of the 
sojournings," is evident from the signification of "sojourning," as being to be instructed (see n. 1463). And as a man acquires life to himself especially by means of instruction in memory-knowledges, 
doctrinal matters, and the knowledges of faith, therefore "sojourning," signifies the life so acquired. As applied to the Lord, "sojourning" signifies the life which He procured to Himself by means 
of knowledges, combats of temptations, and victories therein; and as He procured for Himself that life by His own forces, this is here signified by "the land of the sojournings."  [2] That the Lord 
procured all things to Himself by His own forces, and by His own forces united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and the Divine Essence to the Human Essence; and that He alone thus became righteousness, 
is clearly evident in the Prophets. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Who is this that cometh from Edom, marching in the multitude of his strength? I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there 
was none with Me; I looked around, and there was no one helping; and I was amazed, and there was no one upholding; therefore Mine arm brought salvation unto Me (Isa. 63:1, 3, 5) "Edom" denotes the 
Lord's Human Essence; "strength," and "arm," power that this was from what was His own is clearly said, in that "there was no one helping," "no one upholding," and that "His own arm brought salvation 
unto Him."  [3] In the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     He saw that there was not anyone, and He was amazed that there was none to intercede; and His arm achieved salvation unto Him, and His righteousness supported 
Him; and He put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon His head (Isa. 59:16, 17) meaning in like manner by His own power, and that thereby He became righteousness. That 
the Lord is righteousness is stated in Daniel: </p>
<p>     Seventy weeks are decreed to expiate iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint 
the holy of holies (Dan 9:24). And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will raise unto David a righteous offshoot, and He shall reign as King, and shall act intelligently, and shall do judgment and righteousness in 
the land. In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in confidence; and this is His name whereby they shall call Him, Jehovah our righteousness (Jer. 23:5, 6; 33:15, 16). For this reason 
He is also called "the Habitation of righteousness," in Jeremiah (31:23; 50:7); and in Isaiah (9:6), "Wonderful," and "Hero."  [4] The reason why the Lord so often attributes to the Father that which 
is His own, has been explained above (n. 1999, 2004); for Jehovah was in Him, and consequently in everything that was His. This can be illustrated by what is similar, though not equal, in man. A man's 
soul is in him; and as it is in him, it is in the veriest singulars of him, that is in the veriest singulars of his thought, and of his action. Whatever has not his soul in it, is not his. The Lord's 
soul was Life itself, or Being [Esse] itself, which is Jehovah, for He was conceived from Jehovah; and consequently Jehovah or Life itself was in His veriest singulars; and as Life itself, or Being 
itself, which is Jehovah, was His, as the soul is man's, so that which was Jehovah's was His, which is what the Lord says: that He "is in the bosom of the Father" (John 1:18), and that "all things whatsoever 
that the Father hath are His" (John 16:15, 17:10, 11).  [5] From good, which is Jehovah's, He united the Divine Essence to the Human Essence; and from truth He united the Human Essence to the 
Divine Essence; thus He did all things both in general and in particular from Himself; in fact His Human was left to itself, in order that He might fight of Himself against all the hells, and overcome 
them; and as He had life in Himself that was His own-as already said-He overcame them by His own power and by His own forces, as is also clearly stated in the Prophets, in the passages that have been 
cited. Consequently, as He acquired all things for Himself by His own forces, He became righteousness, emancipated the world of spirits from infernal genii and spirits, and thereby delivered the human 
race from destruction-for the human race is ruled by means of spirits-and so redeemed it. For this reason He is so often called in the Word of the Old Testament the Deliverer and the Redeemer, and 
the Saviour, which is the meaning of His name Jesus. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2025</b></p><p><b>2025.</b>
That 'I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings' means that the Lord acquired to Himself by His own powers all things meant by 'the land of sojournings' is clear from 
the meaning of 'sojourning' as receiving instruction, dealt with in <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>. And because man acquires life to himself chiefly through instruction in facts, matters of doctrine, and cognitions of faith, 
sojourning is consequently the life so acquired. When applied to the Lord it is the life which He obtained for Himself through cognitions, through the conflicts that constituted temptations, and through 
victories in temptations; and because He obtained it by His own powers, this is what 'the land of your sojournings' means here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That the Lord obtained all things for Himself by His own powers, 
and by His own powers united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence and Divine Essence to Human Essence, and that He alone in this way became righteousness, is quite clear in the Prophets, as in 
Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this coming from Edom, marching in the vast numbers of His strength? I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with Me. I looked around and there was no one 
helping; and I was astonished that there was no one upholding; therefore My own arm brought Me salvation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:1,%203,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:1, 3, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Edom' stands for the Lord's Human Essence, 'strength' and 'arm' for power. 
Plain statements to the effect that He acted from His own power are contained in the phrases 'no one helping' and 'no one upholding', and in that about His own arm bringing Him salvation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He saw that there was no one, and wondered that there was nobody to intercede; and His own arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness upheld Him. And He put on righteousness 
as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This similarly means that He acted by His own power, and in so doing became righteousness. That the Lord is righteousness 
is stated in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Seventy weeks have been decreed to atone for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy Place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will raise up for David a righteous branch, and He will reign as king and act with understanding, and He will execute judgement and righteousness in the land. In His days 
Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell in confidence. And this is His name which they will call Him, Jehovah our Righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:5,%206;%2033:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:5, 6; 33:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For this reason He is also called 'the 
Habitation of Righteousness' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:23;%2050:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:23; 50:7</a>, and 'wonderful' and 'Hero' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%209:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 9:6</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason why the Lord so many times attributes to the Father that which is His own has been explained 
above in <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>; for Jehovah was within Him, and so within every single part of Him. Something similar in man may be used for illustration, although there can be no comparison. Within man is 
his soul, and because it is within him, the soul is within every individual part of him, that is to say, within every individual part of his thinking and every individual part of his activity. Anything 
that does not have his soul within it is not part of him. The Lord's soul was Life itself or Being (Esse) itself, which is Jehovah, for He was conceived from Jehovah; thus Life itself was present within 
every individual part of Him. And because Life itself, or Being (Esse) itself, which is Jehovah, belonged to Him in the way that the soul does to man, so that which was Jehovah's was His, which is 
what the Lord says in His statements about His being in the bosom of the Father, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>, and about all things that the Father has being His, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:15;%2017:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:15; 17:10, 11</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From good which is Jehovah's 
He united the Divine Essence to the Human Essence, and from truth united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and so achieved every single thing all from Himself. Indeed His Human was left to 
Itself in order that of Himself He might fight against all the hells and overcome them; and because He had life within Himself, as stated, which was His own, He overcame them by His own power and strength, 
as is also clearly stated in the places quoted from the Prophets. So then, because He acquired all things to Himself by His own powers, He became Righteousness, cleared the world of spirits of 
hellish genii and spirits, and in so doing rescued the human race from destruction - for the human race is governed by means of spirits- and thus redeemed it. This is why the Old Testament Word speaks 
so often of Him as Rescuer and Redeemer, and also Saviour, as His name Jesus describes. </p>

</p><b>2025.</b>
Quod `dabo tibi, et semini tuo post te, terram peregrinationum tuarum' significet quod Dominus omnia Sibi propriis viribus acquisiverit quae sunt `terra peregrinationum,' constat a significatione `peregrinari' 
quod sit instrui, de qua n. 1463; et quia homo (t)vitam sibi acquirit imprimis per instructionem in scientificis, doctrinalibus, et cognitionibus fidei, peregrinatio inde est vita sic acquisita; 
applicate ad Dominum, est vita quam Ipse Sibi comparavit per cognitiones, pugnas tentationum, et in illis victorias, et quia illam Sibi propriis viribus {1}, hic per `terram peregrinationum' illud 
significatur.  [2] Quod Dominus omnia Sibi propriis viribus comparaverit, et propriis viribus univerit Essentiam Humanam Divinae et Divinam Humanae, et quod sic justitia solus factus, constat manifeste 
apud Prophetas, ut apud Esaiam, 	Quis hic veniens ex Edom,... incedens in multitudine 	roboris Sui?... Torcular calcavi solus Ego, et de populis non 	quisquam Mecum:... Circumspexi, et nemo auxilians, 
et 	obstupui, et nemo suffulciens; ideo salutem praestitit Mihi 	brachium Meum, lxiii {2} 1, 3, 5; </p>
<p>`Edom' pro Humana Domini Essentia, `robur et brachium' pro potentia; quod ex propria, clare 
dicitur quod `nemo auxilians, nemo suffulciens' quod `salutem Ipsi praestiterit brachium Ipsius': [3] apud eundem, 	Vidit quod non quisquam, et obstupuit quod nemo intercedens; et salutem praestitit 
Ipsi brachium Ipsius, et justitia Ipsius fulcivit Ipsum: et induit justitiam sicut loricam, et galeam salutis in capite Suo, lix 16, 17; </p>
<p>similiter quod propria potentia, et quod sic justitia factus. 
Quod Dominus justitia, apud Danielem, 	Septimanae septuaginta decisae sunt... ad expiandum iniquitatem, et ad adducendum justitiam saeculorum, et ad obsignandum visionem et prophetam, et ad ungendum 
Sanctum 	Sanctorum, ix 24: </p>
<p>et apud Jeremiam, 	Suscitabo Davidi germen justum, et regnabit rex, et intelligenter aget, et faciet judicium et justitiam in terra; in diebus Ipsius {3} salvabitur Jehudah, 
et Israel habitabit in fiducia; et hoc nomen Ipsius, quod vocabunt Ipsum, Jehovah Justitia nostra, xxiii 5, 6; xxxiii 15, 16; </p>
<p>ideo quoque appellatur `Habitaculum Justitiae,' Jer. xxxi 23; l 7; [4] 
et apud Esaiam, `Mirabilis et Heros,' ix 6.  Quod Dominus toties tribuat Patri quod Ipsius est, explicatum est supra, n. 1999, 2004; Jehovah enim in Ipso fuit, proinde in singulis Ipsius; hoc ex simili 
tametsi non compari, potest illustrari apud hominem; anima hominis est in eo, et quia in eo, est in singularissimis ejus, nempe in singularissimis ejus cogitationis et in singularissimis ejus actionis; 
quicquid non habet animam ejus in se, non est ejus; Anima Domini fuit ipsa Vita seu ipsum Esse quod est Jehovah, nam conceptus a Jehovah, ita fuit in singularissimis Ipsius; et quia ipsa Vita seu 
ipsum Esse quod est Jehovah, fuit Ipsius, sicut anima est hominis, ita Ipsius fuit quod Jehovae, (m)quod est quod Dominus dicit, quod `sit in sinu Patris,' Joh. i 18, et quod `omnia quae Pater habet, 
Sua essent,' Joh. xvi 15; xvii 10, 11 (n).  [5] Ex bono quod est Jehovae, univit Divinam Essentiam Humanae, (o)et ex vero univit Humanam Essentiam Divinae, ita omnia et singula ex Se Ipso; immo Humanum 
Ipsius fuit relictum Sibi ut pugnaret a Se contra omnia inferna et vinceret illa, et quia vitam habuit in Se, ut dictum, quae Ipsius fuit, Sua potentia et Suis viribus illa evicit; sicut etiam clare 
apud Prophetas in locis citatis {4} dicitur.  Inde nunc quia propriis viribus omnia Sibi acquisivit, justitia factus, mundum spirituum vindicavit ab infernalibus geniis et spiritibus, et sic liberavit 
genus humanum ab interitu, nam genus humanum per spiritus regitur, et sic redemit illud; ideo toties in Verbo Veteris Testamenti Liberator et Redemptor dicitur, et Salvator, quod est nomen Ipsius Jesus. 	@1
