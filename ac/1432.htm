<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1432.</strong>“亚伯兰带上他妻子撒莱”表与真理结合的良善。这从圣言中男人和他妻子的含义（参看<a href="915.htm">915</a>节）清楚可知。因此，“撒莱”的内义在此无非是指真理。对男人而言，每一个事物中都有一个婚姻的形像；无论外在人及其一切事物里面，还是内在人及其一切事物里面，都不存在小到里面不包含该形像的任何事物。原因在于，每一个事物的产生和持续存在，都是通过主，通过如祂的人性本质和神性本质结合那样的婚姻，以及祂在天上和地上的国所具有的这两种本质的结合或天堂的婚姻。此处，所代表的是与主的良善结合的真理，由于这里的历史细节都涉及亚伯兰，所以真理只能由“妻子”来代表。一切事物中都有一个婚姻的形像，无论总体还是细节，对此，可参看前文（<a href="54.htm">54</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="718.htm">718</a>，<a href="747.htm">747</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>节）。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1432.</strong> The symbolism of and Abram took Sarai his wife as goodness with truth connected to it can be seen from the symbolic meaning in the Word of a human and his wife, given in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a>.{*1} So in an inner sense here the one thing Sarai means is truth.<br />Absolutely everything in us features something equivalent to a marriage. Never could there be an element so tiny as to lack that image of a marriage, whether in our outer self or our inner self, with all that either encompasses. Every single thing comes into existence and remains in existence because of the Lord and because of the union (the marriage, essentially) between his human quality and his divine quality; and also because of the bond 钬?the heavenly marriage, in other words 钬?between both of those qualities and his kingdom in the heavens and on earth. Here, where truth attached to goodness in the Lord needed to be represented, it could only be represented by Abram's wife, since it could only be represented by historical details involving Abram.<br />Concerning the fact that absolutely everything contains the equivalent of a marriage, see above in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54" target=_top>54</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55" target=_top>55</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718" target=_top>718</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_747" target=_top>747</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_917" target=_top>917</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a> Swedenborg says that when the Bible uses the phrase "a human and his wife," the human symbolizes the good that love embraces, while the wife symbolizes the truth that faith teaches. On this symbolism, see 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468" target=_top>1468</a> and note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1432/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468" target=_top>1468</a>.

And Abram took Sarai his wife. That this signifies good to which truth has been adjoined, is evident from that which is signified in the Word by a man and his wife (see n. 915); thus here, in the internal 
sense, by "Sarai" is signified nothing else than truth. In all things of man both in general and in particular there is an image of a marriage; nor can there possibly be anything so small as not to contain this image 
within it, whether it be in the external man and each and everything belonging to it, or in the internal man and each and everything belonging to it. The reason is that all things both in general 
and in particular come forth and subsist from the Lord, and from the unition of His Human Essence, as in a marriage, with His Divine Essence; and from the conjunction or heavenly marriage of both with 
His kingdom in the heavens and on earth. In the present case therefore, where there was to be represented the truth that is joined to the Lord's good, and this by historic facts concerning Abram, it 
could be represented in no other way than by a "wife." That there is an image of a marriage in all things both in general and in particular, may be seen above (n. 54, 55, 718, 747, 917). </p>

That 'Abram took Sarai his wife' means good to which truth has been joined becomes clear from what is meant in the Word by 'a man (homo) and his wife', dealt with in <a href="915.htm">915</a>. Thus by 'Sarai' here is meant 
nothing else in the internal sense than truth. With man there exists in every single part the likeness of a marriage; nor can anything possibly exist which is too small to have that likeness within 
it - both in the external man in every part, and in the internal man in every part. The reason for this is that every single thing comes into being and is kept in being from the Lord, and from the marriage- 
like union of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence, and from the conjunction or heavenly marriage of both Essences with His kingdom in heaven and on earth. Here, when truth that had been joined 
to the Lord's good was to be represented, that truth could not be represented - since the historical details here have regard to Abram - in any other way than by 'a wife' For the truth that a likeness 
of a marriage resides in every single thing, see what has appeared already in <a href="54.htm">54</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>, <a href="747.htm">747</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>. </p>

'Et accepit Abram Sarai uxorem suam':  quod significet bonum cui adjunctum verum, constare potest ex illo quod significatur in Verbo per 'hominem et ejus uxorem,' de quo n. 915; ita hic per 'Sarai' 
nihil aliud significatur in sensu interno quam verum.  Est in omnibus et singulis apud hominem instar conjugii, nec usquam tam minimum dari potest in quo non instar illud sit, tam in externo homine et 
ejus singulis quam in interno et ejus singulis; causa est quia omnia et singula existunt et subsistunt a Domino, et Ipsius Humanae Essentiae unitione quasi conjugio cum Divina, et ab Utriusque conjunctione, 
seu conjugio caelesti, cum Ipsius regno in caelis et in terris; hic cum repraesentandum verum adjunctum bono Domini, non aliter repraesentari potuit, quia per historica hic de Abramo, quam per 
'uxorem':  quod instar conjugii sit in omnibus et singulis, videantur quae prius n. 54, 55, 718, 747, 917. </p>
