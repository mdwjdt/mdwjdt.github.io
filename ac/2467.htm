<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2467.</strong>创世记19:37，38. 大女儿生了儿子，给他起名叫摩押，就是现今摩押人的始祖；小女儿也生了儿子，给他起名叫便亚米，就是现今亚扪人的始祖。<br />“大女儿生了儿子”表该教会在良善方面的宗教信仰。“给他起名叫摩押”表它的性质。“就是现今摩押人的始祖”表这就是这类人的出身。“小女儿也生了儿子”表该教会被歪曲的真理。“给他起名叫便亚米”表它的性质。“就是现今亚扪人的始祖”表这就是这类人的出身。</p>

Verses 37, 38. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of Moab even unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father 
of the sons of Ammon even unto this day. "The firstborn bare a son," signifies the religion of that church in respect to good; "and called his name Moab," signifies its quality; "he is the father of 
Moab even unto this day," signifies that this is the source of such persons. "And the younger she also bare a son," signifies the falsified truth of that church; "and called his name Benammi," signifies 
its quality; "he is the father of the sons of Ammon even unto this day," signifies that this is the source of such persons. </p>

Verses 37, 38 And the firstborn gave birth to a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of Moab even to this day. And the younger also gave birth to a son and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the 
father of the children of Ammon even to this day. </p>
<p>'The firstborn gave birth to a son' means the religion of that Church as regards good. 'And called his name Moab' means the nature of it. 'He is 
the father of Moab even to this day' means that these are the origins of such people. 'And the younger also gave birth to a son' means the falsified truth of that Church. 'And called his name Ben-ammi' 
means the nature of it. 'He is the father of the children of Ammon even to this day' means that these are the origins of such people. </p>

Vers. 37, 38. Et peperit primogenita filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Moab; is pater Moabi usque ad diem hunc. Et minor etiam illa peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Benammi; is pater filiorum Ammonis 
usque ad diem hunc. `Peperit primogenita filium' significat religiosum Ecclesiae istius quoad bonum: `et vocavit nomen ejus Moab' significat quale ejus: `is pater Moabi usque ad diem hunc' significat 
quod inde tales: `et minor etiam illa peperit filium' significat Ecclesiae istius falsificatum verum: `et vocavit nomen ejus Benammi' significat quale ejus: `is pater filiorum Ammonis usque ad diem
