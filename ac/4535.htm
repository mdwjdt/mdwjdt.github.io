<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4535节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第35章</h4><br />最后的审判（续）<br />4535.自26章以后的各章开头几节解释了主关于祂的降临或世代末了的预言；并反复说明祂的降临或世代末了表示教会的末期，这在圣言中被称为最后的审判。那些目光无法超越字义的人必以为最后的审判就是这个世界的毁灭，这种想法尤其出自启示录，在那里，经上说：<br />我看见一个新天新地。因为先前的天和先前的地已经过去了，海也不再有了。我又看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">21:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">2</a>）<br />还出自以赛亚书中的预言，那里有类似的话：<br />看哪，我造新天新地；从前的事不再被记念，也不再涌上心头了。你们当因我所造的永远欢喜快乐！因为看哪，我造耶路撒冷为人所喜，造其中的居民为人所乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.17.htm">65:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.22.htm">66:22</a>）<br />那些目光无法超越字义的人必断定，整个天堂连同这个大地要毁灭；到那时，死人（第一次）要复活，住在新天新地上。但圣言不是这么理解的，这一点从提到天与地的许多其它经文可以看出来。对内义但凡有点相信的人能清楚看出，“一个新天新地”是指一个新教会；当前教会过去时，这个新教会就会取而代之（参看<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>节）；“天”是该教会的内在，“地”是该教会的外在。<br />前教会的末期和新教会的初期就称作“世代的末了”（consummation of the age），主在马太福音（24章）中曾论及这“世代的末了”。它们还称作“主的降临”，因为那时，主会离开前教会，进入新教会。这就是“世代的末了”（consummation，经上或译为灭绝的事，毁灭之事，毁灭，灭绝等），这一点也可从圣言中的其它经文看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />到那日，所剩下的，就是雅各所剩下的，必归回全能的神。以色列啊，你的百姓虽多如海沙，惟有剩下的归回。原来灭绝的事已定，必有公义涨溢。因为主万军之耶和华在全地之中，必行毁灭之事，铁定之事。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.21.htm">10:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.23.htm">23</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />现在你们不可亵慢，恐怕你们的刑罚加剧。因为我从主万军之耶和华那里听见，要施行毁灭之事，铁定之事。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.22.htm">28:22</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，全地必然荒凉，我却不毁灭净尽。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.27.htm">4:27</a>）<br />西番雅书：<br />我要使人受困苦，以致他们像瞎子行走，因为他们得罪耶和华。他们的血必倒出如灰尘；他们的肉必抛弃如粪土。因为耶和华要彻底毁灭这地的一切居民，必猝然灭绝。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.17.htm">1:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />从此处提到的每个细节明显可知，“毁灭”（或灭绝）是指教会的末期。<br />“地（或陆地）”（earth or land）表示教会，原因是：迦南陆地是自上古时代起教会一直所在的陆地，后来则是建在雅各后代当中的教会代表所在的陆地。当说这陆地或地“毁灭或灭绝”时，意思不是说住在那里的民族，而是说存在于教会所在的那个民族当中敬拜的神圣。因为圣言是属灵的，这陆地或地本身并不是属灵的，住在那里的民族也不是属灵的，唯有构成那里教会的东西才是属灵的。迦南陆地是自上古时代起教会一直所在的陆地（<a href="567.htm">567</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>节）；因此，在圣言中，“陆地”表示教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）。由此明显可知以赛亚书中“在全地之中，必行毁灭之事”，以及西番雅书中“猝然灭绝这地的一切居民”是什么意思。众所周知，住在那地的犹太民族并未被“灭绝”，被“灭绝”的是他们当中敬拜的神圣。<br />“末了”（consummation，经上或译为终止，结局）的这种含义在但以理书看得更清楚：<br />为你百姓和你圣城，已经定了七十个七，要终止罪过，封住罪恶，赎尽罪孽，引进永义，封住异象和预言，并膏至圣所。一七中间，他必使祭祀与供献止息。最终荒凉临到那毁坏可憎的鸟身上，并且有忿怒倾在那行毁坏的身上，直到所定的结局。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.24.htm">9:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">27</a>）<br />由此可见，门徒对主说“你降临和世代的末了，有什么预兆呢”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>）这句话时所问的“世代的末了”无非表示教会的末期。主的这些话，就是该福音书最后一节所表相同：<br />耶稣对门徒说，凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就天天与你们同在，直到世代的末了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.20.htm">28:20</a>）<br />主之所以说，祂与门徒同在，直到世代的末了，是因为主的十二门徒与以色列十二支派所表相同，也就是说表示爱与信的一切事物，因而表示教会的一切事物（参看<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>节）；十二支派所表相同（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。前面已反复说明，当仁，因而信不复存在时，教会的终结或末了就到来了。蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在下文说明，当今教会，就是所谓的基督教会几乎毫无仁和由此而来的信幸存下来；因此，其世代的末了就在眼前。</p>

Genesis 35 </p>
<p>     THE LAST JUDGMENT </p>
<p>Preliminary to the foregoing chapters, from chapter 26, an explication has been given of what the Lord foretold about His advent, or the CONSUMMATION OF THE AGE; 
and it has been repeatedly shown that by His advent or the consummation of the age is signified the last time of the church, which is called in the Word the Last Judgment. They who do not see beyond 
the literal sense must suppose that the Last Judgment is the destruction of the world, and this especially from the Revelation, where it is said: </p>
<p>     I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former 
heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (Rev. 21:1-2). And also from the prophecies of Isaiah, 
where are similar words: </p>
<p>     Behold I create new heavens and a new earth; therefore the former things shall not be remembered, nor come up upon the heart; but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that 
which I create, for behold I create Jerusalem an exultation, and her people a gladness (Isa. 65:17, 18; 66:22). [2] They who do not see beyond the literal sense must infer that the universal heaven 
together with this earth will be annihilated, and that the dead will then for the first time rise again, and dwell in a new heaven and upon a new earth. But that the Word is not to be so understood 
may be seen from many other passages where the heavens and the earth are mentioned. They who have any faith in an internal sense can plainly see that by "a new heaven and a new earth" is meant a new 
church, which shall succeed when the former church passes away (see n. 1733, 1850, 3355); and that the "heaven" is its internal and the "earth" its external. [3] This last time of a former church and 
first time of a new church are what is called the "consummation of the age" of which the Lord spoke in Matthew 24, and also are His advent, for the Lord then leaves the former church and comes to the 
new church. That this is the "consummation of the age" may be seen also from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day the remains shall return, the remains of Jacob, unto the mighty 
God; for although Thy people Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, remains of it shall return; a consummation is determined, inundated is righteousness; for a consummation and a determination doth 
the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth make in the whole earth (Isa. 10:21-23). In the same: </p>
<p>     Now be ye not scorners, lest your punishments be strengthened; for a consummation and a decision have I heard from-with 
the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth upon the whole earth (Isa. 28:22). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah, The whole earth shall be a waste, yet will I not make a consummation (Jer. 4:27). In Zephaniah: </p>
<p> 
    I will bring men into distresses, and they shall go like the blind, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung, for Jehovah 
shall make a consummation, yea, a speedy one, with all them that dwell in the land (Zeph. 1:17-18). That the "consummation" here mentioned is the last time of the church, and that the "earth" is 
the church, is manifest from the particulars.  [4] That "earth" or "land" denotes the church, comes from the fact that the land of Canaan was the land where the church had been from the most ancient 
times, and where afterwards there was the representative of a church among the descendants of Jacob. When this land is said to be "consummated," it is not the nation in it that is meant, but it is the 
holy of worship that exists with the nation where the church is. For the Word is spiritual, and the land itself is not spiritual, nor the nation therein, but that which is of the church. (That the land 
of Canaan was the land where the church had been from the most ancient times, may be seen above, n. 567, 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517; and that for this reason by "land" in the Word is signified the 
church, n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 3355, 4447.) From this it is manifest what is meant in Isaiah by "making a consummation in the whole land," or "earth," and in Zephaniah by the "speedy consummation 
of all that dwell in the land." That the Jewish nation which dwelt in that land was not consummated, but the holy of worship with them, is well known. [5] That this is the "consummation" appears 
still more plainly in Daniel: </p>
<p>     Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy city of holiness, to consummate the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to 
bring in the righteousness of an age, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies; in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; at last upon 
the bird of abominations shall be desolation; and even to the consummation and the determination shall it drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:24, 27). [6] From all this it may now be seen that by the 
"consummation of the age," respecting which the disciples said to the Lord, "What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age?" (Matt. 24:3) nothing else is signified than the 
last time of the church; and also by these words of the Lord, which are the last in the same evangelist: "Jesus said to the disciples, Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded 
you; and lo, I am with you all the days even unto the consummation of the age" (Matt. 28:20). It was said by the Lord that He would be with the disciples even to the consummation of the age, because by 
the Lord's twelve disciples the like is signified as by the twelve tribes of Israel, namely, all things of love and faith, consequently all things of the church (see n. 3354, 3488, 3858); which is the 
same as is meant by the twelve tribes (n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060). That it is the consummation of the church when there is no longer any charity and therefore no faith, has been repeatedly shown above. 
That in this church which is called Christian scarcely anything of charity and its derivative faith survives, thus that the consummation of its age is now at hand, will of the Lord's Divine mercy 
be shown in the following pages.            GENESIS 35 </p>
<p>     1. And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and abide there; and make there an altar unto God who appeared unto thee when thou 
fleddest from before Esau thy brother.      2. And Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the gods of the stranger which are in the midst of you, and purify yourselves, 
and change your garments: </p>
<p>     3. And let us arise, and go up to Bethel, and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I walked.  
    4. And they gave unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger which were in their hand, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.      5. And 
they journeyed; and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.      6. And Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, 
this is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.      7. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-Bethel; because there the gods were revealed unto him when he fled from before his 
brother.      8. And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried from under Bethel under the oak; and he called the name of it Allon-bacuth.      9. And God was seen by Jacob again when he 
came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.      10. And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and He called his name Israel.      11. 
And God said to him, I am God Shaddai; be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall go forth from thy loins.      12. And the land which I gave to 
Abraham and to Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.      13. And God went up from upon him in the place in which He spoke with him.      14. And Jacob set 
up a pillar in the place in which He spoke with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.      15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God 
spoke with him, Bethel.      16. And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was still a tract of land to come to Ephrath; and Rachel brought forth, and suffered hard things in her bringing forth.    
  17. And it came to pass in her suffering hard things in her bringing forth that the midwife said unto her, Fear not, for this also is to thee a son.      18. And it came to pass as her soul was going 
forth that she was about to die; and she called his name Benoni; and his father called him Benjamin.      19. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, this is Bethlehem.      20. And 
Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; this is the pillar of Rachel's grave even to this day.      21. And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.      22. And it came to pass, 
while Israel abode in this land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine, and Israel heard. And the sons of Jacob were twelve.      23. The sons of Leah, Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, 
and Simeon and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.      24. The sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin.      25. And the sons of Bilhah Rachel's handmaid, Dan and Naphtali.      26. And 
the sons of Zilpah Leah's handmaid, Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.      27. And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre Kiriath-arba, this is Hebron, 
where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.      28. And the days of Isaac were a hundred years and eighty years.      29. And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and sated of days; 
and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. </p>

The preliminary sections of previous chapters - Chapter <a href="26.htm">26</a> onwards - explained what the Lord foretold about His Coming or THE CLOSE OF THE AGE. Frequently in those sections it has been shown that His 
Coming or the Close of the Age means the last period of the Church, which in the Word is called the Last Judgement. Those who do not look beyond the literal sense cannot know of the Last Judgement as 
anything else than the destruction of the world, the particular source for such an idea being the Book of Revelation. There it is said that [John] saw 'a new heaven and a new earth, for the former heaven 
and the former earth had passed away; and there was no more sea', and in addition that he saw 'the Holy City, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:1, 2</a>. Prophetical utterances 
in Isaiah, where similar predictions occur, are also a source of the same idea, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am creating new heavens and a new earth; therefore the former things will not be remembered or come to 
mind.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Be glad and rejoice for ever in the things I am creating; behold, I will create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:17,%2018;%2066:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:17, 18; 66:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who do not look beyond the literal 
sense cannot conceive of anything else than this- that the whole sky together with this planet will be annihilated, and then the dead - for the first time - will rise again and dwell in the new heaven 
and on the new earth. But these places in the Word should not be understood in that way, as may be recognized from other places in the Word where the heavens and the earth are referred to. Those who 
have any belief in an internal sense can see plainly that 'a new heaven' and 'a new earth' are used to mean a new Church which takes over when the previous one passes away, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a> (end), 
and that 'heaven' is the internal aspect of that new Church and 'earth' the external aspect of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This last period of the previous Church and the first of the new one are also called the Close 
of the Age, about which the Lord has spoken in Matthew <a href="24.htm">24</a>. They are called also His Coming, for at that time the Lord departs from the previous Church and comes to the new. The description of that period 
as the Close of the Age may also be seen from other places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day a remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the God of power. For though your people Israel 
will be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of it will return. The close has been determined, overflowing with righteousness, for the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth is bringing the whole earth to its close and 
to its determined end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:20-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10:20-23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Now do not be derisive, lest your punishments increase, for a close and a cutting off I have heard from the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth over the 
whole earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2028:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 28:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, The whole earth will be a waste, yet I will not bring it to a close. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will bring men into distress, and 
they will go as the blind, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung. For Jehovah will bring to a close, indeed to a hasty one, 
all the inhabitants of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%201:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 1:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From each detail stated here it is evident that 'a close' means the last period of the Church and 'the earth' the Church itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason 
why 'the earth (or land)' means the Church is that the land of Canaan was the land where the Church had existed since most ancient times, and later on where among the descendants of Jacob a representative 
of the Church existed. When this land is said to have been 'brought to a close' it is not the nation dwelling there that is meant but the holiness of worship which existed with the nation where 
the Church was. For the Word is spiritual; but the actual land is not spiritual, nor is the nation dwelling in it, only that which constitutes the Church there. For evidence that the land of Canaan was 
the land where the Church had existed from most ancient times, see <a href="567.htm">567</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>; and this explains why 'the land' or 'the earth' in the Word means the Church, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. From all this one may see what is meant in Isaiah by 'bringing the whole earth to a close', and in Zephaniah by 'bringing all the inhabitants of the earth to a hasty one'. It is 
well known that the Jewish nation which inhabited that land was not 'brought to a close' but that the holiness of worship among them was. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This meaning of 'the close' is even clearer in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Seventy 
weeks have been decreed concerning your people and your holy city to bring transgression to a close and to seal up sins and to atone for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, 
and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy Place. In the middle of the week he will cause sacrifice and offering to cease. At length upon the bird of desolations will come desolation; 
until a close and a cutting off will it drop upon the devastation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:24,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:24, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From this one may now see that the close of the age - about which the disciples were asking when they said 
to the Lord 'What will be the sign of Your coming and of the close of the age?' <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:3%20-%20d&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:3 - d</a>oes not mean anything else than the final period of the Church. The same is also meant by the Lord's words, 
which are the very last in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the disciples, Teaching them to observe<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> all things whatever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you at all times<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> even to the 
close of the age. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:20</a>.

<p>The reason why the Lord said that He would be with the disciples even to the close of the age is that the Lord's twelve disciples are similar in meaning to the twelve 
tribes of Israel. That is to say, they mean all things of love and faith, and therefore all things of the Church, see <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, as do the twelve tribes, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>. The fact that 
the Church reaches its close when no charity exists there any longer, nor consequently any faith, has been shown several times already; and that within the Church at the present day, called the Christian 
Church, scarcely any trace of charity or consequently of faith survives there; and that the close of the age is accordingly now at hand, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown further on. <A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

GENESEOS                  CAPUT TRIGESIMUM QUINTUM </p>
<p>Ante capita quae praecedunt a cap. xxvi huc usque, explicata sunt quae Dominus praedixerat de Adventu Ipsius seu de CONSUMMATIONE 
SAECULI, et aliquoties ibi ostensum quod per Adventum Ipsius seu Consummationem saeculi, significetur Ultimum Tempus Ecclesiae, quod in Verbo etiam ultimum Judicium vocatur: qui non ultra sensum 
litteralem vident, non aliter scire possent quam quod Ultimum Judicium sit Interitus Mundi, hoc {1} imprimis ex Apocalypsi ubi dicitur,           Quod viderit caelum novum et terram novam; prius enim  
    caelum et prior terra transiit; et mare non erat amplius: </p>
<p>insuper quod           Viderit civitatem Sanctam Hierosolymam novam      descendentem a Deo e caelo, xxi 1, 2; </p>
<p>et quoque ex propheticis 
Esaiae, ubi similia {2},           Ecce Ego creans caelos novos et terram novam; ideo non      commemorabuntur priora nec ascendent super cor: laetamini et      exsultate in aeternum, quae 
Ego creans: ecce Ego creaturus      Hierosolymam, exsultationem, et populum ejus laetitiam, lxv      17, 18; lxvi 22. [2] Qui non ultra sensum litteralem vident, non aliter capiunt quam quod universum 
caelum cum tellure hac in nihilum casurum, et quod tunc primum resurrecturi mortui et {3} in novo caelo ac super nova terra habitaturi; sed quod Verbum hic non ita intelligendum sit constare potest 
a pluribus aliis locis in Verbo, ubi caeli et terra nominantur: qui de sensu interno aliquam fidem habent, ii manifeste videre possunt quod per novum caelum et novam terram intelligatur nova 
Ecclesia quae succedet cum prior transit, videatur n. 1733, 1850, 3355 f, et quod `caelum' sit internum ejus, et `terra' externum.  Ultimum hoc tempus Ecclesiae prioris et primum Ecclesiae novae est 
quod etiam vocatur consummatio saeculi, de qua Dominus apud Matthaeum xxiv locutus est, et Adventus Ipsius, nam tunc recedit Dominus a priore Ecclesia et venit ad novam: quod consummatio saeculi 
illud sit, etiam ab aliis locis in Verbo constare potest; ut apud Esaiam,           In die illo... reliquiae revertentur, reliquiae Jacobi      ad Deum potentem; nam etsi fuerit populus tuus Israel 
sicut      arena maris, reliquiae revertentur ex eo; consummatio      definita, inundata justitia; nam consummationem et      definitionem Dominus Jehovih Zebaoth faciens in tota terra,      x 20-23: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem,           Nunc ne irrideatis, ne forte invalescant punitiones      vestrae, quia consummationem et decisionem audivi a cum      Domino Jehovih Zebaoth super universam terram, xxviii 
22: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,           Sic dixit Jehovah, Vastitas erit tota terra,      consummationem tamen non faciam, iv 27: </p>
<p>apud Zephaniam,           In angustias redigam homines, et ibunt sicut caeci  
    ejus, quia Jehovae peccarunt, et effundetur sanguis eorum      sicut pulvis, et caro eorum sicut stercus,... quia Jehovah      consummationem et quidem festinatam faciet cum omnibus     
 habitatoribus terrae, i 17, 18; </p>
<p>quod `consummatio' ibi sit ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, et quod `terra sit Ecclesia, a singulis patet: quod terra sit Ecclesia, est inde quia terra Canaan fuit terra ubi 
ab antiquissimis temporibus Ecclesia, ac dein apud posteros Jacobi repraesentativum Ecclesiae; </p>
<p>haec terra cum dicitur consummata, non est gens ibi quae intelligitur, sed est sanctum cultus {4} quod 
apud gentem ubi Ecclesia; Verbum enim (t)est spirituale, et ipsa terra non est spirituale, nec gens quae ibi, sed id quod est Ecclesiae: quod terra Canaan fuerit terra ubi ab antiquissimis temporibus 
Ecclesia, videatur n. 567, 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517; et quia ita, quod per `terram' in Verbo significetur Ecclesia, n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 3355, 4447; inde patet quid apud Esaiam 
intelligitur per `consummationem facere in tota terra'; et apud Zephaniam per `consummationem festinatam cum omnibus habitatoribus terrae'; quod gens Judaica, quae fuit habitator terrae illius, non 
consummata sit, sed quod sanctum cultus apud illos, notum est.  [5] Quod consummatio id sit, manifestius adhuc constat apud Danielem,           Septimanae septuaginta decisae sunt super populum tuum,  
    et super urbem sanctitatis tuam, ad consummandum      praevaricationem, et ad obsignandum peccata, et ad expiandum      iniquitatem, et ad adducendum justitiam saeculi, et ad      obsignandum 
visionem et prophetam, et ad ungendum sanctum      sanctorum:... in medio septimanae cessare faciet sacrificium      et oblationem: tandem super avem desolationum desolatio, et      usque ad 
consummationem et decisionem, stillabit super      devastationem, ix 24, 27. [6]  Inde nunc (x)videri potest quod per consummationem saeculi, de qua discipuli ad Dominum,           Quodnam signum 
Tui Adventus et Consummationis saeculi?      [Matth.] xxiv 3, non aliud significetur quam ultimum tempus Ecclesiae; et quoque per haec verba Domini, quae ultima sunt apud eundem Evangelistam,     
      Jesus ad discipulos; Docentes servate omnia quaecumque      mandavi vobis; et ecce Ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque      ad consummationem saeculi, xxviii 20; </p>
<p>quod dIctum a Domino quod cum 
discipulis esset usque ad consummationem saeculi, est quia per duodecim discipulos Domini significantur similia quae per duodecim tribus Israelis, nempe omnia amoris et fidei, proinde omnia Ecclesiae, 
videatur n. 3354, 3488, 3858; quod per duodecim tribus, n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060: </p>
<p>quod consummatio Ecclesiae sit quando ibi nulla amplius charitas et inde nulla fides, prius aliquoties ostensum 
est': quod in hac Ecclesia quae Christiana vocatur, vix aliquid {5} charitatis et inde fidei supersit, ita quod consummatio ejus saeculi nunc adsit, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
ostendetur.      @1 i et$      @2 i plura$      @3 at I$      @4 Ecclesiae$      @5 i amplius$ </p>
<p>                         CAPUT XXXV </p>
<p>     1.  Et dixit DEUS ad Jacobum, Surge, ascende Bethelem, 
et commorare {1} ibi, et fac ibi {2} altare DEO viso ad te in fugiendo te a coram Esau fratre tuo.      @1 mane$      @2 tibi I$      2.  Et dixit Jacob ad domum suam, et ad omnes qui cum illo, Removete 
deos alienigenae, qui in medio vestri, et purificemini, et mutate vestes vestras.      3.  Et surgamus, et ascendamus Bethelem, et faciam ibi altare DEO respondenti mihi in die angustiae 
meae, et fuit mecum in via quam ambulavi.      4.  Et dederunt ad Jacobum omnes deos alienigenae, qui in manu illorum, et inaures quae in auribus illorum, et abscondidit illa Jacob sub quercu 
quae juxta Shechem.      5.  Et profecti sunt; et fuit terror DEI super urbes quae circumcirca illos, et non persecuti post filios Jacobi.      6.  Et venit Jacob ad Luz, quae in terra Canaan, haec 
Bethel, ille et omnis populus qui cum illo.      7.  Et aedificavit ibi altare, et vocavit locum El-Bethel, quia ibi revelati ad illum dii, in fugiendo illo a coram fratre suo.      8.  Et moriebatur 
Deborah nutrix Rebeccae, et sepeliebatur desubter Bethel sub quercu, et vocavit nomen ejus Allon Bacuth.      9.  Et visus DEUS ad Jacobum adhuc, in veniendo illo e Paddan Aram, et benedixit 
illi.      10.  Et dixit illi DEUS, Nomen tuum Jacob, non vocabitur nomen tuum amplius Jacob, quin immo Israel erit nomen tuum; et vocavit nomen illius Israel.      11.  Et dixit illi DEUS, Ego DEUS 
Shaddai, fructificare et multiplicare, gens et coetus gentium erit e te, et reges e lumbis tuis exibunt.      12.  Et terram quam dedi Abrahamo et Jishako, tibi dabo eam, et semini tuo post te 
dabo terram.      13.  Et ascendit desuper illo DEUS in loco quo locutus cum illo.      14.  Et statuit Jacobus statuam in loco quo locutus cum illo, statuam lapidis, et libavit super illam libamen, 
et fudit super illam oleum.      15.  Et vocavit Jacob nomen loci ubi locutus cum illo DEUS, Bethel.      16.  Et profecti a Bethel, et fuit adhuc tractus terrae ad veniendum (x)Ephratam, et 
peperit Rachel, et dura passa in pariendo illam.      17.  Et factum in dura patiendo illam, in pariendo illam, et dixit illi obstetrix, Ne timeas, quia etiam hic tibi filius.      18.  Et factum 
in exire animam illius quod moritura, et vocavit nomen illius Benoni; et pater illius vocavit illum Benjamin.      19. Et moriebatur Rachel, et sepeliebatur in via Ephrath, haec Bethlehem.      20. 
 Et statuit Jacob statuam super sepulcrum illius, haec statua sepulcri Rachelis, usque ad hodie.      21.  Et profectus Israel, et tetendit tentorium suum ab ultra turrim Eder.      22.  Et factum 
in residendo Israel in terra hac, et ivit Reuben, et cubuit cum Bilhah concubina patris sui, et audivit Israel. Et fuerunt filii Jacobi duodecim.      23.  Filii Leae; primogenitus Jacobi Reuben, 
et Shimeon, et Levi, et Jehudah, et Jisaschar, et Zebulun.      24.  Filii Rachelis, Joseph et Benjamin.      25.  Et filii Bilhae ancillae Rachelis, Dan et Naphthali.      26.  Et filii Zilpae 
ancillae Leae, Gad et Asher: hi filii Jacobi, qui nati illi in Paddan Aram.      27. Et venit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum, Mamre Kiriath Arba, haec Hebron, ubi peregrinatus Abraham et Jishak.  
    28.  Et fuerunt dies Jishaki centum anni et octoginta anni.      29.  Et exspiravit Jishak, et mortuus est, et collectus ad populos suos, senex et satur dierum; et sepeliverunt illum Esau et Jacob 
filii illius. </p>
