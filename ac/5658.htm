<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5658节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5658.</strong>“我们分量足数的银子”表与各人的状态相称的真理。这从“银子”和“分量”的含义清楚可知：“银子”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）；“分量”是指事物在良善方面的状态（<a href="3104.htm">3104</a>节）；因此，“与各人的状态相称的真理”就是与他们所能接受的良善相称。圣言的许多地方都提到分量和尺寸；然而，就内义而言，它们不是指分量和尺寸。相反，分量表示事物在良善方面的状态，尺寸表示事物在真理方面的状态。这同样适用于重量和空间；自然界的重量对应于灵界的良善，空间对应于真理。原因在于，天堂，即对应关系的源头既没有重量，也没有空间，因为空间在那里并不存在。诚然，拥有这些属性的事物似乎存在于灵人中间；但这些事物是由这些灵人之上的天堂中的良善与真理的状态所产生的表象。<br />“银子”表示真理，这在古时是众所周知的。因此，古人将这个世界的几个时代从初至末划分为黄金时代、白银时代、青铜时代和黑铁时代；在此之上，他们又加了一个泥土时代。当纯真和完美存在时，并且当人人都出于良善行良善，出于公义行公义时，他们就称这些时代为“黄金时代”。当纯真不复存在，但仍有某种完美，这种完美不在于出于良善行良善，而在于出于真理行真理时，他们就称这些时代为“白银时代”。他们给比白银时代更为低劣的时代起名为“青铜时代”和“黑铁时代”。<br />他们如此命名这些时代不是出于比较，而是出于对应。因为古人知道“银子”对应于真理，“黄金”对应于良善；他们通过与灵人并天使交流而得知这一点。因为当高层天堂讨论良善时，该讨论在他们之下那些处于第一层或最低层天堂的天使当中就显为黄金；当讨论真理时，该讨论在那里就显为白银。有时，不仅他们所住房间的墙壁，就连里面的空气都因金银而闪闪发光。在出于良善而处于良善的第一层或最低层天堂天使的家中，可以看见金桌子，金灯台和许多其它物件；而在出于真理而处于真理的天使家中，则可以看见银制的类似物件。然而，如今，有谁知道古人正是出于它们的对应关系而称这些时代为黄金和白银时代？事实上，如今有谁知道关于对应的任何事？不知道这一切的人，尤其认为快乐和智慧在于争论这种观念是真是假的人，无法开始知道属于对应关系的无数方面。</p>

Our silver in its weight. That this signifies truths according to each one's state, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954); and from the signification of "weight," 
as being the state of a thing as to good (n. 3104); thus "truths according to each one's state" is according to the good they are capable of receiving. Weights and measures are mentioned in many 
passages of the Word; yet in the internal sense they do not signify weights and measures; but weights signify the states of a thing as to good, and measures the states of a thing as to truth. So also 
do heaviness and extension; heaviness in the natural world corresponds to good in the spiritual world, and extension to truth. The reason is that in heaven, which is the source of correspondences, 
there is no heaviness and no extension, because there is no space. Things indeed appear heavy and extended among spirits; but these are appearances arising from states of good and truth in a higher heaven. [2] 
That "silver" signifies truth was very well known in ancient times. Hence the ancients distinguished the several ages of the world from the first to the last into the golden, the silver, the 
copper, and the iron ages, to which they added an age of clay. They called those times the golden ages when there was innocence and wholeness, and when everyone did what was good from good, and what 
was just from justice. They called those times the silver ages when there was no longer innocence, but still a kind of wholeness that consisted not in doing good from good, but in doing truth from truth; 
and they gave the name of copper and iron to the ages which are yet lower.  [3] That they so designated these periods was not from comparison, but from correspondence; for the ancients knew that 
silver corresponds to truth, and gold to good, and this by communication with spirits and angels. For when good is spoken about in a higher heaven, there is an appearance of gold below among those who 
are beneath them in the first or lowest heaven; and when truth is spoken of, there is an appearance of silver; sometimes so that not only the walls of the rooms where they dwell sparkle with gold and 
silver, but also the very atmosphere. Tables of gold also, golden lampstands, and many other things, appear with the angels of the first or ultimate heaven who are in good from good; while to those 
who are in truth from truth, such objects appear of silver. Yet who at the present day knows that it was from their correspondence that the ancients called these the gold and silver ages? Indeed who at 
this day knows anything about correspondence? And he who does not know this, and still more he who makes pleasure and wisdom consist in disputing whether it is or is not so, cannot know the least of 
the countless things that belong to correspondence. </p>

'Our silver in its full weight' means truths commensurate with each one's state. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>; and from the meaning of 'weight' as the 
state of  something as regards good, dealt with in <a href="3104.htm">3104</a>, so that truths commensurate with each one's state means commensurate with the good they are able to receive. Many places in the Word make reference 
to weights or to measures, but no weight nor any measure is meant in the internal sense. Rather states so far as the good involved in some reality is concerned are meant by 'weights', while states 
so far as the truth involved in it is concerned are meant by 'measures'. The same applies to the properties of gravity and spatial magnitude; gravity in the natural world corresponds to good in the 
spiritual world, and spatial magnitude to truth. The reason for this is that in heaven, where correspondences originate, neither the property of gravity nor that of spatial magnitude exists because space 
has no existence there. Objects possessing these properties do, it is true, seem to exist among spirits, but those objects are appearances that have their origins in the states of goodness and truth 
in the heaven above those spirits. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It was very well known in ancient times that 'silver' meant truth; therefore the ancients divided up periods of time ranging from the earliest to the latest 
world epochs into the golden ages, the silver ones, the copper ones, and the iron ones, to which they also added the clay ones. They applied the expression 'golden ages' to those periods when innocence 
and perfection existed, when everyone was moved by good to do what was good and by righteousness to do what was right. They used 'silver ages' however to describe those times when innocence did not 
exist any longer, though there was still some sort of perfection, which did not consist in being moved by good to do what was good but in being moved by truth to do what was true. 'Copper ages' and 
'iron ages' were the names they gave to the times that were even more inferior than the silver ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What led those people to give periods of time these names was not comparison but correspondence. 
For the ancients knew that 'silver' corresponded to truth and 'gold' to good; they knew this from being in communication with spirits and angels. For when a discussion takes place in a higher heaven 
about what is good, this reveals itself among those underneath them in the first or lowest heaven as what is golden; and when a discussion takes place about what is true this reveals itself there 
as what is silvery. Sometimes not only the walls of the rooms where they live are gleaming with gold and silver but also the very air within them. Also, in the homes of those angels belonging to the 
first or lowest heaven who are moved by good to live among what is good, tables made of gold, lampstands made of gold, and many other objects are seen; but in the homes of those who are moved by truth 
to live among what is true, similar objects made of silver are seen. But who at the present day knows that correspondence was what led the ancients to call ages golden ones and silver ones? Indeed who 
at the present day knows anything at all about correspondence? Anyone who does not know this about the ancients, and more so anyone who thinks pleasure and wisdom lie in contesting whether such an idea 
is true or untrue, cannot begin to know the countless facets there are to correspondence. </p>

`Argentum {1}nostrum in pondere suo': quod significet vera secundum statum cujusvis, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954; et a significatione `ponderis' quod sit 
status rei quoad bonum, de qua n. 3104; (m)ita vera secundum statum cujusvis est secundum bonum quod recipere possunt. (n) Pondera et mensurae multis in locis in Verbo nominantur, at in sensu interno 
non significant pondera et mensuras sed `pondera' significant status rei quoad bonum, et `mensurae' status rei quoad verum; sicut etiam gravitas et extensio, `gravitas' quae in mundo naturali, correspondet 
bono in mundo spirituali, et `extensio' vero; causa est quia in caelo, unde correspondentiae, non datur gravitas, nec extensio, quia non spatium; apparent quidem gravia et extensa {2}apud spiritus, 
sed sunt apparentiae {3}oriundae ex statibus boni et veri in caelo superiore. [2]Quod `argentum' significet verum,  notissimum fuerat antiquis temporibus, inde antiqui tempora a prima aetate ad {4}ultimam 
mundi distinxerunt in saecula aurea, argentea, cuprea, et ferrea, quibus etiam adjecerunt argillacea; saecula aurea vocaverunt illa tempora cum innocentia et integritas fuit, et cum quisque 
bonum faciebat ex bono, et justum ex justo; {5} argentea autem dixerunt illa tempora cum non amplius innocentia erat, sed usque species integritatis, quae non constabat in eo quod bonum facerent ex bono, 
sed in eo quod verum facerent ex vero; saecula autem cuprea et ferrea appellabant illa quae adhuc inferiora sunt; [3]quod ita appellaverint tempora, non erat ex comparatione, sed ex correspondentia; 
sciverunt enim antiqui quod `argentum' corresponderet vero et quod `aurum' bono, et hoc ex communicatione cum spiritibus et angelis; cum enim in caelo {6}superiore loquela est de bono, apparet infra 
apud illos qui in primo seu ultimo caelo sub illis sunt, aureum; et cum loquela est de vero, apparet ibi argenteum; quandoque ita ut non modo  parietes conclavium ubi habitant, coruscent auro et argento, 
sed etiam ipsa atmosphaera ibi; et quoque apud angelos primi seu ultimi caeli, qui in bono sunt ex bono, apparent mensae ex auro, candelabra ex auro, et plura alia; apud illos autem qui in vero 
sunt ex vero, apparent talia ex argento; sed quis hodie novit quod saecula ab antiquis {7}vocata fuerint aurea et argentea ex correspondentia? immo quis hodie aliquid de correspondentia novit? et qui 
hoc non novit, et magis qui volupe et sapiens in eo ponit ut disputet num sit vel non sit, {8}is ne quidem potest minimum scire de innumerabilibus quae correspondentiae `{9}sint'. @1 suum A I, but see
