<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1965节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1965.</strong>这就是本章有关亚伯兰、夏甲和以实玛利的细节的内义。然而，至于这内义何等丰富，也就是说，它所包含的细节何等无穷无尽，这单单从以下考虑可以看出来：就内义而言，圣言中的每一个事物都关注主，以主为它的主题，故圣言的生命，就是圣言本身，由此产生。另外，就内义而言，每一个事物同时以主在天上的国度，以及主在地上的国度，也就是教会为它的主题。它同样以心中拥有主国度的每个人为其主题，除此之外，还以总体上一切属天或属灵之物为其主题。因为主是所有这些事物的源头，正因如此，亚伯兰也代表属天教会，属天之人，属天之物本身等等。不过，要进一步展开解读会显得冗长乏味。</p>

This then is the internal sense of the things contained in this chapter concerning Abram, Hagar, and Ishmael. But how copious this sense is, that is, what illimitable things it contains, may be seen 
from the mere consideration that as in the internal sense all things in the Word both in general and in particular regard the Lord, and treat of the Lord-for the life of the Word, because the Word itself, 
is from this-they also, in the internal sense, treat at the same time of His kingdom in the heavens, and of His kingdom on earth, which is the church; and in the same way they treat of everyone in 
whom is the Lord's kingdom; and besides this they treat in general of all that is celestial and spiritual, for all these are from the Lord. Hence it is that by Abram is also represented the celestial 
church, the celestial man, and the celestial itself, and so on. But to extend the explication to all these would make it too tedious. </p>

This then is the internal sense of the details in this chapter concerning Abram, Hagar, and Ishmael. Yet how inexhaustible that sense is, that is, how limitless the details it contains, may be seen from 
the single consideration that, as every single thing in the Word looks in the internal sense to the Lord and has the Lord as its subject, the life of the Word, being the Word itself, arises out of 
this. In addition every single thing has at the same time in the internal sense the Lord's kingdom in heaven as its subject, and also His kingdom on earth, which is the Church. And in a similar way it 
has as its subject each individual who has the Lord's kingdom within him, besides having in general everything celestial or spiritual as its subject. For the Lord is the source of all these things, 
and this accounts for Abram's also representing the celestial Church, the celestial man, as well as the celestial itself, and so on. To extend the explanation any further however would take much too long. </p>

</p><b>1965.</b>
Hic nunc est sensus internus rerum in hoc capite de Abramo, Hagare et Ismaele; sed quam copiosus ille sensus sit, seu [quam] indefinita contineat, constare solum exinde potest quod sicut omnia et singula 
quae in Verbo, in sensu interno spectent Dominum et agant de Domino, vita Verbi, quia ipsum Verbum, inde est; etiam in sensu interno simul agant de regno Domini in caelis, tum de regna Ipsius in 
terris, hoc est, de Ecclesia; similiter de unoquovis in quo est regnum Domini; et praeterea in genere de omni caelesti et spirituali; nam ex Domino omnia haec: inde est quod per `Abramum' etiam repraesentetur 
caelestis Ecclesia, caelestis homo, tum ipsum caeleste: et sic porro; (o)sed eo usque explicationem extendere, prolixissimum foret.' </p>
