<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5268节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5268.</strong>“那在它们之后上来的七只又干瘦又丑陋的母牛是七年”表攻击内层属世层的虚假增多时的状态。这从“母牛”、“上来”和“年”的含义清楚可知：“母牛”在正面意义上是指内层属世层里面的真理（参看<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>节），但在反面意义上指那里的虚假（<a href="5202.htm">5202</a>节），故前者被称为“好”母牛，而后者被称为“又干瘦又丑陋”的母牛；“上来”是指朝向内层事物的发展（<a href="5202.htm">5202</a>节）；“年”是指状态，如刚才所述（<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>节）。“七”表神圣之物，故在反面意义还表示亵渎之物。因为在圣言中，绝大多数事物都有一个反面意义，这是因为在天堂产生的事物在流向地狱的过程中，就被转变为相反的事物，实际上变成它们的对立面。所以“七”所表示的神圣之物在那里也就变成了亵渎之物<br />“七”既表示神圣之物，也表示亵渎之物，这一点从仅从启示录中提及七的经文就能得以证实。以下就是表示神圣之物的地方：<br />约翰写信给七个教会：但愿恩惠、平安归与你们，就是来自那昔在、今在、以后永在的和祂宝座前的七灵。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.4.htm">1:4</a>）<br />这些事是那有七灵和七星的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.1.htm">3:1</a>）<br />从宝座中发出的七盏火灯在宝座前点着，这七灯就是神的七灵。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.5.htm">4:5</a>）<br />我看见坐宝座的右手中有书卷，里外都写着字，用七印封严了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.1.htm">5:1</a>）<br />我又观看，看哪，在宝座中间有羔羊站立，像是被杀过的，有七角七眼，就是神的七灵，奉差遣往全地去的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.6.htm">5:6</a>）<br />有七枝号赐给七位天使。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.2.htm">8:2</a>）<br />在第七位天使发声的日子，神的奥秘就成全了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.7.htm">10:7</a>）<br />那掌管七灾的七位天使，从殿中出来，穿着洁白光明的细麻衣，胸间束着金带。四活物中有一个把七个金香瓶给了那七位天使。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.6.htm">15:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“七”在反面意义上表示亵渎之物，这从启示录中的这些经文明显看出来：<br />看哪，有一条大红龙，七头十角，七头上戴着七个冠冕。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.3.htm">12:3</a>）<br />我又看见一个兽从海中上来，有十角七头，角上有十个冠冕，头上有亵渎的名号。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.1.htm">13:1</a>）<br />我就看见一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上。那兽有七头十角，满了亵渎的名号。这就是有智慧的心思。那七头就是七座山，就是女人所坐的地方。又是七位王。那先前有，如今没有的兽，自己是第八位。他也和那七位同列，并且归于沉沦。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.3.htm">17:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.11.htm">11</a>）</p>

And the seven thin and evil kine that came up after them are seven years. That this signifies states of the multiplication of falsity that infests the interior natural, is evident from the signification 
of "kine," as being in the genuine sense truths in the interior natural (see n. 5198, 5265), but in the opposite sense falsity therein (n. 5202), and therefore the former are called "good" kine, but 
the latter "thin and evil;" from the signification of "coming up," as being progression toward interior things (n. 5202); and from the signification of "years," as being states (of which just above, 
n. 5265). As "seven" signifies what is holy, so too in the opposite sense it signifies what is profane; for most of the expressions in the Word have also an opposite sense, and this for the reason that 
the same things that take place in heaven, on flowing down toward hell, are turned into the opposite things, and actually become opposite. Hence the holy things signified by "seven" there become profane. [2] 
That by "seven" both holy and profane things are signified, may be confirmed from the passages in Revelation alone where seven is mentioned. First, that holy things are signified: </p>
<p>	John 
to the seven churches, Grace and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits that are before His throne (Rev. 1:4). 	These things saith He that hath the seven spirits, 
and the seven stars (Rev. 3:1). 	Out of the throne went forth seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God (Rev. 4:5). I saw upon the right hand of Him that 
sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals (Rev. 5:1). I saw and behold in the midst of the throne stood a Lamb, as though it had been slain, having seven horns 
and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6). 	To the seven angels were given seven trumpets (Rev. 8:2). In the days of the voice of the seventh angel 
the mystery of God should be consummated (Rev. 10:7). 	The seven angels that had the seven plagues went forth from the temple, clothed in linen white and shining, and girt about their breasts with 
golden girdles. Then one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials (Rev. 15:6-7). [3] That in the opposite sense "seven" signifies profane things is plain from these passages 
also in Revelation: </p>
<p>	Behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems (Rev. 12:3). 	I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten 
horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads a name of blasphemy (Rev. 13:1). 	I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. Here 
is intelligence, if anyone hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sitteth upon them; and they are seven kings. The beast that was, and is not, is himself the eighth king, 
and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition (Rev. 17:3, 7, 9-11). </p>

'And the seven thin and bad cows coming up after them are seven years' means a state when falsity attacking the interior natural is multiplied. This is clear from the meaning of 'cows' in the genuine 
sense as truths within the interior natural, dealt with in <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>, but in the contrary sense as falsities there, dealt with in <a href="5202.htm">5202</a>, so that the former are called 'good cows', but the latter 'thin 
and bad'; from the meaning of 'coming up' as an advance made towards things that are interior, dealt with in <a href="5202.htm">5202</a>; and from the meaning of 'years' as states, dealt with just above in <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>. Even as 'seven' 
means that which is holy, so in the contrary sense it means that which is unholy. For most things in the Word have a contrary meaning as well, the reason for this being that when the selfsame things 
as come into being in heaven pass downwards in the direction of hell, they are converted into things of an opposite nature and become in actual fact their opposites. Consequently things that are 
holy, meant by 'seven', are made in that place into those that are unholy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let references to the number seven found solely in the Book of Revelation serve to prove that 'seven' is used to mean 
both holy things and unholy ones. The following are places where holy things are meant, </p>
<blockquote>
John to the seven Churches: Grace and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven 
spirits who are before His throne. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These things says He who has the seven spirits and the seven stars. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
From the throne there were coming seven lamps of fire burning before 
the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:5</a>.

<blockquote>
I saw on the right hand of Him sitting on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I looked, 
and behold, in the midst of the throne, a Lamb standing as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
To 
the seven angels were given seven trumpets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God was to be fulfilled. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2010:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 10:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Out of the temple came the seven angels having 
the seven plagues, clothed in linen, white and splendid, and girded around their breasts with golden girdles. Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2015:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 15:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'seven' in the contrary sense means things that are unholy is evident from the following places, also in the Book of Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, a great fiery-red dragon 
having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven jewels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, which had seven heads and ten horns, and on its horns ten jewels, but on its heads 
a blasphemous name. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names; and it had seven heads and ten hems. Here is the understanding of this - if anyone has the wisdom: 
The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; and they are seven kings. The beast which was, and is not, he is the eighth king, and is of the seven, and is going away into perdition.

`Et septem vaccae graciles et malae ascendentes post eas, septem anni eae': quod significet status multiplicationis falsi infestantis interius naturale, constat ex significatione `vaccarum' quod in 
genuino sensu sint vera in interiore naturali, de qua n. 5198, 5265, in opposito autem falsa ibi, de qua n. 5202, quapropter illae vocantur `vaccae bonae', hae autem `graciles et malae'; ex significatione 
`ascendere' quod sit progressivum versus interiora, de qua n. 5202; et ex significatione `annorum' quod sint status, de qua mox supra n. 5265.  Sicut `septem' significant sanctum, ita quoque in opposito 
sensu significant profanum; pleraque enim in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum habent, et hoc ex causa quia eadem quae in caelo fiunt, cum defluunt versus infernum, vertuntur in opposita et fiunt actualiter 
opposita; inde sancta quae per `septem' significantur, fiunt ibi profana; [2] quod per `septem' significentur et sancta et profana, licet ex septem (t)solum nominatis in Apocalypsi confirmare; 
quod sancta ibi,  Johannes septem Ecclesiis; Gratia et pax ab Illo, Qui est, et Qui erat, et Qui venturus est, et a septem spiritibus qui sunt coram throno Ipsius, i 4:   Haec dicit, Qui habet septem 
spiritus, . . . et septem stellas, iii I   E throno exibant . . . septem lampades ignis ardentes coram throno, quae sunt septem spiritus Dei, iv 5:   Vidi super dextra sedentis super throno librum 
scriptum intus et a tergo, obsignatum septem sigillis, v 1:   Vidi cum ecce in medio throni . . . Agnus stans tanquam mactatus, habens cornua septem, et oculos septem, qui sunt septem Dei spiritus 
emissi in omnem terram, v 6:   Septem angelis datae sunt septem tubae, viii 2:   In diebus vocis septimi angeli . . . consummandum erat mysterium Dei, x 7:   Exiverunt septem angeli habentes septem 
plagas e templo, induti linteo albo et splendido, et circumcincti circa pectora cingulis aureis; tunc unum ex quatuor animalibus dedit septem angelis septem phialas aureas, xv 6,7. [3] Quod `septem' 
in opposito sensu significent profana, patet ab his etiam in Apocalypsi,   Ecce draco magnus rufus habens capita septem, et cornua decem, et super capitibus ejus diademata septem, xii 3:   Vidi e 
mari bestiam ascendentem, quae habebat capita septem, et cornua decem, et super cornibus suis decem diademata, super capitibus autem suis nomen blasphemiae, xiii 1:   Vidi mulierem sedentem super bestia 
coccinea, plenam nominibus blasphemiae, et habebat capita septem, et cornua decem. . . . Hic intelligentia, si quis habet sapientiam, septem capita sunt montes septem, ubi mulier sedet super illis, 
et reges septem sunt. . . . Bestia quae erat, et non est, ille rex octavus est, et ex septem, et in perditionem abit, xvii 3, 7, 9, 11.   </p>
