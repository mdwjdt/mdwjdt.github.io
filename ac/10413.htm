<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10413节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10413</strong>.“次日清早，他们起来”表被他们自己的爱激起。这从“清早起来”的含义清楚可知，“清早起来”是指被他们自己的爱激起，因为“清早”表示一种爱的状态，“起来”表示被提升到这种状态。“早晨或清早”表示一种爱的状态（参看<a href="5962.htm">5962</a>，<a href="8426.htm">8426</a>，<a href="8812.htm">8812</a>，<a href="10114.htm">10114</a>，<a href="10134.htm">10134</a>节）；“起来”表示被提升（<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2785.htm">2785</a>，<a href="2912.htm">2912</a>，<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>，<a href="3171.htm">3171</a>，<a href="4103.htm">4103</a>节）。但当“清早起来”论到那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物之人，因而论到恶人时，“起来”就不是指一种提升，而是指一种激起，“清早或早晨”就不是指一种天堂之爱的状态，而是指一种地狱之爱的状态。当恶人进入这种状态时，这就是他们的早晨，事实上这时他们进入自己的生命快乐，因为现在他们自己的爱掌控了他们。就被提升到他们自己的爱所掌控的状态而言，善人与恶人的区别在于：这时善人上升，而恶人却下降。因为支配善人的爱是提升他们的天堂之爱，并随着他们升到天堂而增加；而主宰恶人的爱是把他们拉下来的地狱之爱，并随着他们下入地狱而增加。由此明显可知，“清早起来”论及恶人时的含义，与论及善人时的正好相反。此外，在来世，灵人和天使的爱和信的状态接连发生变化，就像一日四时和一年四季的热和光一样。当早晨降临到天堂里的人时，一种唤起天堂之爱，从而给他们带来喜乐的状态就存在；但当早晨降临到地狱里的人时，一种唤起地狱之爱，从而给他们带来痛苦的状态就存在。因为这时，后者当中的每一个都想成为最大的，并占有属于他人的一切；这就造成地狱之火所表示的根深蒂固的仇恨、报复和残忍。</p>

And they rose up in the morning on the morrow. That this signifies incitement by their loves, is evident from the signification of "rising up in the morning," as being incitement by their loves; for 
by "the morning" is signified a state of love, and by "rising up" is signified elevation thereto. (That "morning" denotes a state of love, see n. 5962, 8426, 8812, 10114, 10134; and that "to rise up" 
denotes elevation, n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103.) But when "rising up in the morning" is said of those who are in external things without what is internal, thus of the evil, then by "rising up" 
is not signified elevation, but incitement; and by "morning" is not signified a state of heavenly love, but a state of infernal love. For when the evil are in this state they are then in their morning, 
because they are then in the delight of their life, because in their loves. The difference between elevation to a state of the loves in the case of the good, and the same in the case of the evil, 
is this: that the good then ascend, and that the evil descend. For the loves of the good are heavenly loves which elevate them, and increase according to the ascent to heaven; but the loves of the evil 
are infernal loves, which weigh them down, and increase according to the descent to hell. From this it is evident that "rising up in the morning" has a contrary signification when it is said of the 
evil, from what it has when it is said of the good. Moreover, in the other life the states of spirits and of angels vary in respect to love and faith, as the times of the day and of the year vary in 
respect to heat and light. When it is morning with those who are in the heavens, they are then in a state of heavenly loves, and consequently are in their joy; but in the morning of the hells they are 
in a state of infernal loves, and consequently are in their torment; for everyone then wishes to be greatest and to possess all that belongs to others, from which come intestine hatreds, ferocities, 
and cruelties, which are the things signified by the fires of hell. </p>

'And they rose up in the morning of the next day' means arousal by the loves that are their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'rising up in the morning' as arousal by the loves that are their own; 
for 'the morning' means a state of love, and 'rising up' being raised to that state.  </p>
<p>'The morning' means a state of love, see <a href="5962.htm">5962</a>, <a href="8426.htm">8426</a>, <a href="8812.htm">8812</a>, <a href="10114.htm">10114</a>, <a href="10134.htm">10134</a>.  'Rising up' means being raised, <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2785.htm">2785</a>, <a href="2912.htm">2912</a>, <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, <a href="3171.htm">3171</a>, <a href="4103.htm">4103</a>.  </p>
<p>But when the words 'rising up in the morning' apply to those whose interest lies in external things devoid of what is internal, and so when they apply to the evil, 
'rising up' does not mean being raised but an arousal, and 'the morning' does not mean a state of heavenly love but a state of hellish love. When the evil enter that state it is morning for them, for 
then they enter into the delight of their life because now the loves that are truly theirs take charge of them. The difference between the good and the evil being raised to the state in which their 
own loves take charge is that the good do then go up whereas the evil go down. For the loves that govern the good are heavenly ones which raise those people and increase as they ascend to heaven, whereas 
the loves ruling the evil are hellish ones which pull these people down and increase as they descend into hell. From this it is evident that the words 'rising up in the morning' have a contrary meaning 
when they apply to the evil from what they do when they apply to the good. Also in the next life spirits and angels' states of love and faith change from one to another, just as the heat and light 
of times of day and seasons of the year do. When morning dawns on those in heaven a state exists which arouses heavenly loves and consequently brings them joy; but when it dawns on those in hell a 
state exists which arouses hellish loves and consequently brings them torment. For each of the latter then wishes to be the greatest and to possess all that belongs to another; and this gives rise to 
deep-seated hatred, savagery, and cruelty, which are meant by the fires of hell.  </p>

`Et surgebant mane postridie': quod (x)significet excitationem ab amoribus suis, constat ex significatione `surgere mane' quod sit excitatio ab amoribus suis, per `mane' enim significatur status amoris, 
et per `surgere' elevatio ad illum; quod `mane' sit status amoris, videatur n. 5962, 8426, 8812, 10,114, 10,134, et quod `surgere' sit elevatio, n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103; at cum `surgere 
mane' dicitur de illis qui in externis absque interno sunt, ita de malis, tunc per `surgere' non significatur elevatio sed excitatio, et per `mane' non status amoris caelestis sed status amoris infernalis, 
cum enim mali in illo statu sunt, in suo mane sunt, nam tunc in suae vitae jucundo quia {1}in suis amoribus; discrimen inter elevationem ad statum amorum apud bonos et apud malos est quod boni 
ascendant tunc et quod mali descendant, amores enim apud bonos sunt amores caelestes qui elevant illos et crescunt secundum ascensum ad caelum, amores autem apud malos sunt amores infernales qui deprimunt 
illos (c)et crescunt secundum descensum {2}ad infernum; inde patet quod `surgere mane' contrarium significet cum id dicitur de malis quam cum dicitur de bonis. Etiam in altera vita variantur 
status spirituum et angelorum quoad amorem et fidem, {3}quemadmodum variantur {4}tempora dierum et annorum quoad calorem et lucem; quando illis qui in caelis sunt, mane est, tunc in statu amorum caelestium 
sunt, et inde in suo gaudio, at in infernis tunc in statu amorum infernalium sunt, et inde in suo cruciatu; nam quisque tunc vult maximus esse et possidere omnia alterius, inde odia intestina, saevitiae, 
et crudelitates, quae sunt quae significantur per ignes infernales. @1 i tunc$  @2 eorum$  @3 sicut$  @4 dies et anni in terris$  </p>
