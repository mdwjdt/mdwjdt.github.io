<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3893节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3893.</strong>天使唱诗班曾出于内心的喜乐而一起赞美主，他们的赞美有时听上去就像甜美的歌声。因为灵人和天使彼此都有宏亮的声音，并且像世人那样听见彼此。而人类的声音，无论多么甜美、和谐，根本无法与这些天使唱诗班的相提并论。我从声音的多样性发觉有许多唱诗班。与我同在的天使指教我说，这些唱诗班属于肺部区域及其功能，唱歌是他们的职业，因为这就是肺的活动。我还通过经历得知这一点。他们被允许控制我的呼吸，如此温和、轻柔而又内在，以致我几乎没有意识到自己的呼吸。我进一步被告知，被指派无意识呼吸者和被指派有意识呼吸者截然不同。他们说，当人入睡时，被指派无意识呼吸者便与此人同在。因为一旦人睡着了，他的有意识呼吸就会停下来，而无意识呼吸会接管。</p>

Angelic choirs were once celebrating the Lord together, and this from gladness of heart. Their celebration was sometimes heard as sweet singing; for among themselves spirits and angels are possessed 
of a sonorous voice, and are heard by each other as well as a man is heard by a man; but human singing is not to be compared with that for a sweetness and harmony which are celestial. From the variety 
of the sound I perceived that there were many choirs. I was instructed by the angels with me that they belonged to the province of the lungs and to their functions; for it is theirs to sing because this 
is the office of the lungs. This also was given me to know by experience. They were permitted to direct my respiration, which they did so gently and sweetly, and also so interiorly, that I was scarcely 
sensible of any respiration of my own. I was further instructed that they who are appointed to the involuntary respiration are distinct from those who are appointed to the voluntary respiration; 
and I was told that they who are appointed to the involuntary respiration are present with man during sleep; for as soon as he sleeps, the voluntariness of his respiration ceases, and he receives involuntary 
respiration. </p>

Angelic choirs were once praising the Lord and doing so with heartfelt joy. Their praises were heard sometimes as sweet singing, for to one another spirits and angels have resounding voices and they 
hear one another as well as men hear one another. But no human singing, however heavenly its sweetness and harmony, can compare with that of those angelic choirs. From the variety of sound I perceived 
that there were many choirs. I was told by the angels present with me that those choirs belonged to the province of the lungs and the functions of these, singing being their role because that is an activity 
of the lungs, as I was also given to know from experience. They were allowed to control my breathing, which was done so gently and softly and also interiorly that I was scarcely aware of myself 
breathing at all. I was also told that those assigned to involuntary breathing are distinct and separate from those assigned to voluntary. They said that those assigned to involuntary breathing were 
present when a person is asleep, for as soon as he is asleep his voluntary breathing stops and the involuntary takes over. </p>

Erant chori angelici qui simul celebrabant Dominum, et hoc ex cordis laetitia; audita erat celebratio quandoque ut ex dulci cantu, vox enim sonora est spiritibus et angelis inter se, et audiuntur 
sibi tam bene a homo homini {1}, sed cantus humanus quoad suavitatem et harmoniam, qua caelestis, non illi comparabilis est; </p>
<p>ex soni varietate percepi quod plures chori essent; instruebar ab angelis 
qui apud me, quod illi ad provinciam pulmonum et eorum functiones pertinerent, illis enim est cantus quia hoc officium est pulmonum, hoc {2} etiam per experientiam scire dabatur; licebat illis regere 
respirationem meam, quod fiebat tam leniter et dulce et quoque interius ut vix ullam (t)meam respirationem sentirem: </p>
<p>instruebar etiam quod distincti essent illi qui respirationi involuntariae 
et respirationi voluntariae dicati sunt; dicebatur quod qui involuntariae respirationi dicati sunt, adsint cum homo dormit, nam ut primum homo dormit, cessat ejus voluntarium respirationis, et excipit 
respirationis involuntarium. @1 i inde illis quoque est cantus$ @2 quod$ </p>
