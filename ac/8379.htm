<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8379.</strong>他们的住所也被指示给我。它们低矮，由木头建成，内部覆盖一层白蓝色的树皮，周围和上面点缀着小星星，类似天空。因为他们想让他们的房屋内部看上去像可见的天空及其星辰。这是因为他们认为天使所住的地方就在天空。另外，他们也有圆顶、拉长的帐篷；这些帐篷里面同样点缀蓝色背景上的小星星。白天他们就进去，防止他们的脸被太阳的热灼伤；他们精心呵护自己的脸，因为他们并不将脸视为身体的一部分。他们格外用心地修整他们这些帐篷，并保持清洁，也在里面吃饭。</p>

Their dwellings were also shown me. They are low, and of wood; but within they are lined with bark or rind of a pale azure, and around and above dotted as with little stars, in the image of the sky; 
for they desire to give to the interior of their houses the likeness of the visible sky with its stars. The reason is that they believe the abodes of the angels to be there. Besides this, they have tents, 
which are rounded at the top, and stretched out long, also dotted within with little stars on an azure ground. Into these they betake themselves in the daytime, to prevent their faces from being 
injured by the heat of the sun, for they take very great care of the face, because they do not consider it to be the body. They bestow great care in forming and cleaning these tents; and they also have 
their meals in them. </p>

I have also been shown their dwelling-places. They are low, made from wood; but on the inside they have a covering of whitish blue bark, and round about and above they are dotted as if with stars, resembling 
the sky. For they wish to make the inside of their houses look like the visible sky with the heavenly bodies in it. They do this because they believe that the places where angels live are in 
the sky. In addition they have tents, rounded at the top and elongated. These too on the inside are dotted with stars on a blue background. They enter them during the daytime so that the heat of the sun 
may not harm their faces; they take the greatest care of their face, for they do not think of it as part of the body. They take much care over shaping these tents of theirs and keeping them clean; 
they also eat in them. </p>

Habitacula illorum etiam mihi ostensa sunt: sunt humilia, ex ligno, sed intus circuminducta libro seu cortice albe caeruleo, et circumcirca (c)ac supra punctata sicut stellulis ad imaginem caeli, {1}nam 
volunt intus inducere domibus suis instar caeli aspectabilis cum suis sideribus; causa est quia ibi credunt domicilia angelorum esse.  Praeterea etiam tentoria habent, {2}superne rotundata, ac protensa 
in longum, etiam intus (x)punctata stellulis in plano caeruleo; in illa se conferunt interdiu ne ab aestu solis laedantur facies illorum, nam faciem maxime conservant, quoniam illam non considerant 
ut corpus; {3}illorum multa cura est tentoria haec sua formare et mundare; in illis etiam comedunt. 	@1 quam maxime$ 	@2 supra$ 	@3 eorum maxima$ </p>
