<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4321.</strong>尽管这些事看似矛盾，令人难以置信，但它们却不可否认，因为经验本身指示它们是千真万确的。如果原因不得而知的一切事物都被否认，那么出现在自然界的无数事物都会遭到否认，因为能知道的原因几乎不到万分之一。事实上，自然界的奥秘如此之多、如此之大，以致人所知的，与人所不知的相比，几乎如同无有。那么，出现在超自然领域，也就是灵界的奥秘又会是什么情形呢？如以下奥秘：只有一个独一的生命，所有人都从该生命接受自己的生命，没有哪两个人的接受方式是一样的。甚至恶人也从这独一生命接受自己的生命，地狱也是。所流入的生命照它被接受的方式而起作用；天堂被主照着人的样式而有序排列，它也由此被称为大人。因此，人里面的一切事物皆与其对应；没有从天堂进入人里面一切事物的流注，人类无法存活片刻；大人里面所有人的位置照着他们所在真理与良善的性质和状态而保持不变；那里的位置并不是位置，而是状态；因此左边的人看上去一直在左边，右边的人一直在右边，前面的人一直在前面，后面的人一直在后面；他们看上去在头部、胸部、背部、脚部、头顶上和脚底下的水平面上，或径直或倾斜，或近或远。他们就占据这些位置，无论灵人如何并转向哪个方向；显为太阳的主看上去一直在右边，就在右边的半空中，在右眼这个水平面稍向上一点；那里的一切事物都与显为太阳的主和那里的中心有关，因而与它们独一的源头有关，它们都从该源头产生并持续存在。由于出现在主面前的所有人照其良善与真理的状态而保持位置不变，故他们以同样的方式出现在每个人面前，因为主的生命，因而主自己就在天堂中的所有人里面。更不用提其它无数奥秘了。</p>

Although these things appear paradoxical and incredible to man, they nevertheless are not to be denied, because experience itself dictates them. If all things were denied the causes of which are not 
known, innumerable things that come forth in nature would be denied, the causes of which are known scarcely as to a ten-thousandth part; for the secret things therein are so many and so great that those 
which man knows are scarcely anything in comparison with those which he does not know. What then must be the secret things that come forth in the sphere which is above nature, that is, in the spiritual 
world! As for example these: That there is one only life, and all live from it, and everyone differently from another: that the evil also live from the same life, and likewise the hells, and that 
the inflowing life acts according to its reception: that heaven has been so ordered by the Lord as to bear relation to a man, whence it is called the Grand Man; and that in consequence all the things 
in man correspond thereto: that man without influx therefrom into everything in him, cannot subsist even for a moment: that all in the Grand Man keep in a constant situation according to the quality 
and the state of the truth and good in which they are; that situation there is not situation, but state, and therefore those appear constantly at the left who are at the left, those at the right who are 
at the right, in front those who are in front, behind those who are behind, in the plane of the head, the breast, the back, the loins, and the feet, above the head and below the soles of the feet, 
directly and obliquely, and at a less or greater distance, those who are there, however and to whatever quarter the spirit may turn himself: that the Lord as a Sun appears constantly to the right, and 
there at a middle height, a little above the plane of the right eye; and that all things there have relation to the Lord as the Sun and center, and thus to their only One from which they come forth and 
subsist, and as all appear before the Lord constantly in their own situation, according to their states of good and truth, they therefore appear in the same way to everyone, for the reason that the 
Lord's life, and consequently the Lord, is in all who are in heaven. Not to mention innumerable other things. </p>

Though these are apparent contradictions and unbelievable to man, they must not for all that be rejected as untrue, because experience itself declares that they are true. If everything for which the 
cause is not known were so rejected, countless things that reveal themselves in the natural order, for which scarcely one ten-thousandth of their causes is known, would be rejected. For the arcana belonging 
to the natural order are so many and so great that those which man knows are scarcely any in comparison with those he does not know. What must the situation be with the arcana that reveal themselves 
in the sphere above the natural order, that is, in the spiritual world, such as the following? </p>
<p>There is one life alone, and from this all receive their life, each individual in a different way 
from another. Even the evil receive their life from that one life alone, and so too do the hells. Inflowing life acts according to the way it is received. </p>
<p>Heaven is ordered by the Lord in such a 
way that it is like a Human Being, on account of which it is called the Grand Man. Consequently everything in the human being corresponds to it. </p>
<p>Without influx from heaven into everything with him 
the human being cannot remain in being even for an instant. All in the Grand Man occupy an unchanging position determined by the nature and the state of the truth and good which governs them. Position 
there is not position but state, and therefore those on the left are seen constantly on the left, those on the right constantly on the right, those in front constantly in front, and those behind constantly 
behind. They are seen to be on a level horizontal with the head, chest, back, loins, or feet, overhead or underfoot, straight ahead or obliquely, closer in or further away. They occupy these positions, 
no matter how or in which direction a spirit turns. </p>
<p>The Lord as the Sun is seen constantly on the right, in the middle of the sky there, a little above a line horizontal with the right eye; 
and everything exists in relation to the Lord as the Sun and to the Centre there, and so in relation to its one and only source from which it is brought into being and kept in being. And since all appear 
before the Lord occupying their own unchanging positions, which are determined by states of good and truth, they are therefore seen in the same way by everyone, for the reason that the Lord's life, 
and therefore the Lord Himself, is present in everyone in heaven. </p>
<p>And there are countless other arcana besides these. </p>

Haec tametsi apparent paradoxa et incredibilia homini, usque tamen non neganda quia ipsa experientia dictat; si negarentur omnia quorum causae non sciuntur, negarentur innumerabilia quae existunt 
in natura, quorum vix quoad unam myriadis partem noscuntur causae; tot enim et tanta arcana ibi sunt ut quae novit homo, vix aliquid sint respective ad illa quae non novit; quid non arcana quae existunt 
in sphaera quae supra naturam est, hoc est, in mundo spirituali? sicut haec: quod unica vita sit et ex illa vivant omnes, et unusquisque aliter ac {1} alter; quod etiam mali ex eadem vita vivant 
et quoque inferna; et quod vita influens agat secundum receptionem: quod caelum a Domino (o)ita ordinatum sit ut {2} referat Hominem {3}, (o)unde vocatur illud Maximus Homo, et quod inde correspondeant 
ei singula {4} quae apud hominem: quod homo absque influxu inde in singula apud illum, ne quidem momento subsistere possit: quod omnes in Maximo Homine teneant situm constantem secundum quale 
et statum veri et boni in quo sunt: quod situs ibi non sit situs sed status, et inde quod constanter appareant ad sinistrum qui ad sinistrum, ad {5} dextrum qui ad dextrum, antrorsum qui antrorsum, 
a tergo qui ad tergum, ad planum capitis, pectoris, tergi, lumborum, pedum, supra caput et infra plantas, directe et oblique, ad minorem aut majorem distantiam, qui ibi sunt, utcumque et ad quamcumque 
plagam se spiritus circumvertit {6}: quod Dominus ut Sol constanter appareat ad dextrum, ad mediam ibi altitudinem, paulo supra planum oculi dextri, et quod ad Dominum ut Solem (o)et ad Centrum 
ibi se referant omnia, ita {7} ad suum unicum, a quo existunt et subsistunt {8}; et quia apparent omnes coram Domino constanter in suo situ secundum status boni et veri, ideo {9} apparent singulis 
similiter, ex causa quia vita Domini, proinde Dominus, inest omnibus qui in caelo: praeter innumerabilia alia.      @1 quam$      @2 i sic$      @3 i Maximum$      @4 correspondeat singulis$
