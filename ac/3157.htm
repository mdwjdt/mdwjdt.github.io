<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3157节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3157.</strong>“现在你们若愿以怜悯诚实待我主人”表通过他们的两种官能，即意愿和理解力探究这同意。这从“怜悯”和“诚实”的含义清楚可知：“怜悯”是属于善或爱之物（参看<a href="3063.htm">3063</a>，<a href="3073.htm">3073</a>，<a href="3120.htm">3120</a>节）；“诚实”是属于真理或信之物（<a href="3121.htm">3121</a>，<a href="3122.htm">3122</a>节）。因属于爱的良善属于意愿，属于信的真理属于理解力，并且此处这些话（它们论到施怜悯诚实）是对拉班和彼土利、因而是对普通人说的，故这些话表示从他们的两种官能，即意愿和理解力所发出的东西。这是对同意的探究，这从经上的话明显看出来，即此处“你们若愿”和下文“就告诉我；若不然，也告诉我；使我可以或向左看，或向右看”。<br />人的重生是主荣耀的一个形像（参看<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>节），其情况是这样：信之真理的确被获知，但不被良善承认，更不被它接受，除非同意从这两种官能，即意愿和理解力流入。同意是承认本身。接受通过承认发生，尤其通过意愿，因为良善就在那里。当信之真理被意愿，或也可说，被良善接受时，人就重生了。因为这时，真理属于良善，或信属于仁；即就生活而言，真理就是仁爱本身（<a href="3121.htm">3121</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3157</b></p><p><b>3157.</b>
Now if ye will do mercy and truth with my lord. That this signifies exploration of the consent from each of their faculties, that of the will, and that of the understanding, is evident from the signification 
of "mercy," as being what is of good or of love (see n. 3063, 3073, 3120); and from the signification of "truth," as being what is of truth, or of faith (n. 3121, 3122) and because the good which 
is of love is of the will, and the truth which is of faith is of the understanding, and these things are said to Laban and Bethuel, thus to men, that they should do mercy and truth, they signify 
what is from each of their faculties, namely, the will and the understanding. That it is exploration of consent, is evident both from its being said, "if ye will do," and from the words that follow, "tell 
me; and if not, tell me; and I will look to the right hand or to the left." In the regeneration of man, which is an image of the Lord's glorification (see n. 3138), the case is that the truth of 
faith is indeed learned, but is not acknowledged, still less received by good, unless there is consent from each faculty, namely, the will and the understanding. Consent is acknowledgment itself; by this 
is effected reception, and indeed from the will, for good is there; and when the truth of faith has been received by the will, or what is the same, by good, then the man is regenerate; for then truth 
is of good, or faith is of charity, or as to life is charity itself (n. 3121). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3157</b></p><p><b>3157.</b>
'Now if you are going to show mercy and truth to my master' means investigation of their consent by both mental powers - will and understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'mercy' as that which 
is the essence of good or love, dealt with in <a href="3063.htm">3063</a>, <a href="3073.htm">3073</a>, <a href="3120.htm">3120</a>, and from the meaning of 'truth' as that which is the essence of truth or faith, dealt with in <a href="3121.htm">3121</a>, <a href="3122.htm">3122</a>. Now since the good of love belongs 
properly to the will, and the truth of faith properly to the understanding, and since the words here - which speak of showing mercy and truth - are addressed to Laban and Bethuel, and so to ordinary 
human beings, those words mean the things which proceed from both mental powers, from both the will and the understanding. The fact that it is investigation of the consent is evident both from the 
words used here ('if you are going to show') and the words that follow ('tell me; and if not, tell me, and I will look to the right or to the left'). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In human regeneration, which is an image 
of the Lord's glorification, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, the truth of faith may indeed be learned, but it is not acknowledged, still less accepted by good, until consent flows from both mental powers - from the will and from 
the understanding. Consent is acknowledgement itself. Through that acknowledgement acceptance takes place, especially by the will, for there good resides. And when the truth of faith has been accepted 
by the will, or what amounts to the same, by good, a person is regenerate, for in his case truth is grounded in good, and faith is grounded in charity; that is, as regards life, truth is charity 
itself, <a href="3121.htm">3121</a>. </p>

</p><b>3157.</b>
`Nunc si sitis vos facientes misericordiam et veritatem cum domino meo': quod significet explorationem consensus eorum ex utraque facultate, voluntatis et intellectus, constat ex significatione `misericordiae' 
quod sit boni seu amoris, de qua n. 3063, 3073, 3120; et ex significatione `veritatis quod sit veri seu fidei, de qua n. 3121, 3122; et quia bonum quod amoris est voluntatis, et verum quod 
fidei est intellectus, et haec dicuntur ad Labanem et Bethuelem, ita ad homines, quod illi facerent misericordiam et veritatem, significant quae ex utraque eorum facultate, nempe voluntatis et intellectus; 
quod sit exploratio consensus, {1}patet, tam ex his quod dicatur `si sitis vos facientes,' quam ab illis quae sequuntur `indicate mihi, et si non, indicate mihi, et spectabo ad dextram vel ad sinistram.' 
[2] In regeneratione hominis, quae est imago glorificationis Domini, n. 3138, ita se habet: quod verum fidei quidem discatur sed non agnoscatur, minus recipiatur a bono, nisi consensus sit 
ab utraque facultate, nempe voluntate et intellectu; consensus est ipsa agnitio; {2}per hanc fit receptio, et quidem a voluntate, nam ibi est bonum: et quando verum fidei receptum est a voluntate, seu 
quod idem, a bono, tunc est homo regeneratus, nam tunc verum est boni, seu fides est charitatis, `seu quoad vitam ipsa charitas', n. 3121. @1 i ab illis$  @2 i et$  </p>
