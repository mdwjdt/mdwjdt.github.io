<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10536节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10536</strong>.“也没有人佩戴妆饰”表他们的外在的性质，即它缺乏神性之物。这从“妆饰”的含义清楚可知，“妆饰”是指神性之物在外在事物中的存在。因此，“没有佩戴妆饰”表示神性之物在外在事物中的不存在。“妆饰”之所以具有这种含义，是因为“妆饰”与衣服有关，而衣服一般表示神性真理。衣服一般表示神性真理，这一点来源于来世的代表。在来世，所有人，无论天使还是灵人，看上去都穿着衣服，各人穿着与自己的真理相一致的衣服。那些拥有来自神的纯正真理之人穿着明亮的白衣；其他人则穿着不同于这些人的衣服。灵人的确不知道他们衣服是从哪来的；他们不知不觉就穿上衣服。此外，他们的衣服照着他们在真理方面的状态变化而变化。简言之，他们的衣服所揭示并代表的，正是他们的理解力；因为每个人的理解力都是通过真理形成的，并具有和构成它的真理一样的性质。天上的天使所拥有的理解力住在他们自己的内在层面，因此他们的衣服明亮而洁白。明亮是由于神性良善，洁白是由于天堂的光，也就是神性真理。但那些兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物之人的衣服是暗淡而破旧的，就像街上乞丐或林中强盗的衣服一样。由此可见“妆饰”表示什么，即表示教会的神圣真理，所以“不佩戴妆饰”表示教会神圣真理的不存在，论及兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物的以色列民族时，表示他们的外在的性质，其性质是这样，它缺乏来自神的真理。“衣服”表示真理（参看<a href="2132.htm">2132</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>，<a href="4763.htm">4763</a>，<a href="5248.htm">5248</a>，<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>，<a href="6378.htm">6378</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="6918.htm">6918</a>，<a href="9093.htm">9093</a>，<a href="9158.htm">9158</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>，<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>，<a href="9827.htm">9827</a>，<a href="9952.htm">9952</a>节）；至于亚伦和他儿子的衣服表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>，<a href="10068.htm">10068</a>节）。在圣言中，“妆饰”表示教会的神圣真理（参看下面<a href="10540.htm">10540</a>节）。</p>

And they put not any man his ornament upon him. That this signifies the quality of their external, that it was devoid of what is Divine, is evident from the signification of "ornament," as being what 
is Divine in external things. Thus, "not to put his ornament upon him" denotes to be devoid of what is Divine in external things. The reason why this is signified by "ornament" is that ornament bears 
relation to garments, and by "garments" in general are signified Divine truths. That this is the signification of "garments" in general, originates in the representatives in the other life, where all, 
both angels and spirits, appear clothed in garments, and each one according to his truths. They who are in genuine Divine truths appear clothed in white shining garments, and others in other garments. 
Spirits do not know whence their garments come, but are clothed with them without knowing this. Moreover, their garments vary according to the changes of their state in respect to truths. In a word, 
it is their understanding which is presented to view and represented by their garments, for each person's understanding is formed by means of truths, and becomes such as are the truths from which it 
is formed. With the angels of heaven their understanding is in their internal, and consequently they have white shining garments. The shining is from Divine good, and the whiteness is from the light 
of heaven, which is Divine truth. But the garments of those who are in external things without what is internal are dusky and tattered, like those of beggars in the streets and of robbers in the woods. 
From this it can be seen what is signified by "ornaments," namely, the holy truths of the church, and consequently "not putting on their ornament" denotes to be devoid of the holy truths of the church; 
and in application to the Israelitish nation, which was in external things without what is internal, it denotes the quality of the external without truths from the Divine. (That "garments" denote 
truths, see n. 2132, 2576, 4545, 4763, 5248, 5319, 5954, 6378, 6914, 6917, 6918, 9093, 9158, 9212, 9216, 9814, 9827, 9952; as also what is signified by the "garments of Aaron and of his sons," n. 9814, 
10068.) That in the Word, "ornament" signifies the holy truths of the church, will be seen in the following article (n. 10540). </p>

'And no one put on his finery' means the nature of their external which is such that it lacks what is Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'finery' as the presence of what is Divine in external 
things, so that 'not putting on his finery' means the absence of what is Divine in those things. The reason why 'finery' has this meaning is that 'finery' relates to clothing, and Divine Truths are meant 
by clothing generally. The reason why Divine Truths are meant by clothing generally lies in things in the next life that are representative. All there, both angels and spirits, appear clothed in garments, 
each one in garments that accord with his truths. Those in possession of truths that are authentic and come from God appear clothed in brilliantly white garments; others appear in others different 
from these. Spirits indeed do not know where their garments come from; they are clothed without their knowing how. And also the garments they wear are varied, as determined by the changes of state 
they undergo in respect of truths. In short, the character of their understanding is what is revealed and represented by their garments; for everyone's understanding is shaped by truths and comes to 
have the same nature as the truths which compose it. The understanding which angels in heaven possess resides on an inner level with them, as a consequence of which their garments are brilliant and 
white. The brilliance is due to Divine Good, and the whiteness to the light of heaven, which is Divine Truth. But the garments of those whose interest lies in external things and not in what is internal 
are drab and torn, like those of beggars in the streets or robbers in the forests. From all this what is meant by 'finery' may be seen, namely the Church's holy truths, and therefore 'not putting on 
finery' means the absence of the Church's holy truths, and in reference to the Israelite nation, whose interest lay in external things and not in what was internal, means the nature of their external 
which was such that it lacked truths from God.  </p>

`Et non posuerunt aliquis ornatum suum super se':  quod significet quale externi eorum quod absque Divino, constat ex significatione `ornatus' quod sit Divinum in externis, ita `non ponere ornatum super 
se' est absque Divino in externis; quod hoc per `ornatum' significetur, {1}est quia ornatus ad vestes refertur, et per `vestes' in genere significantur Divina Vera; quod per `vestes' in genere significentur 
Divina Vera, ducit causam ex repraesentativis in altera vita; ibi omne tam angeli quam spiritus apparent induti vestibus, et quisque secundum vera {2}sua; qui in genuinis veris Divinis sunt, 
illi apparent induti vestibus albis {3}splendescentibus, ac alii aliis; spiritus (x)quidem non sciunt unde illis vestes veniunt, sed induuntur (t)nescientibus illis; et quoque vestes eorum variantur 
secundum mutationes status eorum quoad vera; verbo intellectuale eorum est quod sistitur et repraesentatur per vestes, nam intellectuale cujusvis formatum est per vera, et fit tale, qualia sunt vera 
ex quibus; intellectuale apud angelos caeli est in interno eorum, inde illis vestes albae splendentes; {4}splendor est ex Divino Bono et albedo est ex luce caeli, quae est Divinum Verum; at vestes illorum 
qui in externis sunt absque interno, sunt furvae ac lacerae, quales mendicorum in plateis et {5} latronum in silvis; inde constare potest quid per `ornatum' significatur, quod nempe sancta vera 
Ecclesiae, et inde per `non ponere ornatum' esse absque sanctis veris Ecclesiae, et applicate ad gentem Israeliticam, quae in externis absque interno erat, quale externi {6} absque veris (c)a Divino. 
 Quod `vestes' sint vera, videatur n. 2132, 2576, 4545, 4763, 5248, 5319, 5954, 6378, 6914, 6917, 6918, 9093, 9158, 9212, 9216, 9814, 9827, 9952.  Quid vestes Aharonis et filiorum ejus, n. 9814, 10068; 
quod `ornatus' in Verbo significet sancta vera Ecclesiae, videbitur in sequenti articulo n. 10540. @1 est quia vestes in genere significant Divina Vera, ita quoque ornatus qui etiam ad vestes referunt,
