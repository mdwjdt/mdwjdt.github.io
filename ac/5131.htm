<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5131.</strong>“你得好处的时候”表当对应关系存在时。这从“你得好处”的含义清楚可知：当论述外层属世层或感官能力的重生或再生时，“你得好处”是指对应关系；因为感官能力在对应事物之前不会得好处。从各章末尾可以看出何为对应关系。感官印象与属世观念存在一种对应关系，属世观念与属灵事物存在一种对应关系，属灵事物与属天事物存在一种对应关系，最后属天事物与主的神性存在一种对应关系。因此，一系列的对应关系从神性一直延伸到属世层的最末和最低层级。<br />人以前若从未思想过这些对应关系的性质，就很难对它形成任何概念，故有必要对这个主题作以简要说明。从哲学清楚可知，目的先于原因，原因先于结果。为使得目的、原因和结果依次出现并行如一体，结果必须与原因相对应，原因必须与目的相对应。然而，目的并不表现为原因，原因也不表现为结果。相反，为使得原因能够存在，目的必须在原因所属的那个层面上行动，呼召辅助手段来帮助它，以便它能通过这些手段产生原因；为使得结果存在，原因同样必须在结果所属的层面上行动，呼召辅助手段来帮助它，以便它能通过这些手段产生结果。这些辅助手段就是那相对应的；由于它们相对应，所以目的能存在于原因中，并能驱动原因；原因能存在于结果中，并驱动结果。因此，目的通过原因能驱动结果。但是，当对应关系不存在时，情况则不然。在这种情况下，目的没有它能存在于其中的一个原因，更没有它能存在于其中的任何结果。相反，目的会照着辅助手段所制造的形式而在原因里面，最终在结果里面经历变化和变异。<br />人里面的一切事物，甚至自然界中的一切事物，都无一例外地作为目的、原因和结果相继出现。当它们以这种方式彼此对应时，就会行如一体；因为在这种情况下，目的是原因全部中的全部，并通过原因是结果全部中的全部。例如，当天堂之爱是目的，意愿是原因，行为是结果时，如果那时这三者存在于彼此的对应关系中，那么天堂之爱就会流入意愿，意愿则流入行为，于是它们行如一体，以至于通过它们彼此的对应关系，行为可以说就是爱。再例如，当仁之信是目的，思维是原因，言语是结果时，如果那时这三者存在于彼此的对应关系中，那么基于仁之信便流入思维，思维流入言语，于是它们行如一体，以至于通过它们彼此的对应关系，言语可以说就是目的。然而，为叫目的，即爱与信，能产生原因，即意愿与思维，目的必须在理性心智里面呼召必相对应的辅助手段。因为没有相对应的辅助手段，目的，即爱与信，就无法被接受，无论它如何从主经由天堂流入。由此明显可知，人的内层与外层，也就是他的理性概念、属世观念和感官印象必须被带入对应的状态，好叫神性能流入并被人接受，因而好叫他能重生；在此之前，他一切都不好。由此可见，“你得好处的时候”在此表示当对应关系存在时</p>

When it is well with thee. That this signifies when there is correspondence, is evident from the signification of its "being well with thee," when the rebirth or regeneration of the exterior natural 
or sensuous is treated of, as being correspondence; for it is not well with it until it corresponds. At the end of the different chapters it may be seen what correspondence is. There is a correspondence 
of sensuous with natural things, a correspondence of natural with spiritual things, a correspondence of spiritual with celestial things, and finally a correspondence of celestial things with the Divine 
of the Lord; thus there is a succession of correspondences from the Divine down to the ultimate natural.  
 </p>
<p>[2] But as an idea of the nature of correspondences can with difficulty be formed by those 
who have never thought about them before, it may be well to say a few words on the subject. It is known from philosophy that the end is the first of the cause, and that the cause is the first of the 
effect. That the end, the cause, and the effect may follow in order, and act as a one, it is needful that the effect should correspond to the cause, and the cause to the end. But still the end does 
not appear as the cause, nor the cause as the effect; for in order that the end may produce the cause, it must take to itself administrant means from the region where the cause is, by which means the 
end may produce the cause; and in order that the cause may produce the effect, it also must take to itself administrant means from the region where the effect is, by which means the cause may produce 
the effect. These administrant means are what correspond; and because they correspond, the end can be in the cause and can actuate the cause, and the cause can be in the effect and can actuate the effect; 
consequently the end through the cause can actuate the effect. It is otherwise when there is no correspondence; for then the end has no cause in which it may be, still less an effect in which it 
may be, but is changed and varied in the cause, and finally in the effect, according to the form made by the administrant means.  
 </p>
<p>[3] All things in general and in particular in man, nay, all things in 
general and in particular in nature, succeed one another as end, cause, and effect; and when they thus correspond to one another, they act as a one; for then the end is the all in all things of the 
cause, and through the cause is the all in all things of the effect. As for example, when heavenly love is the end, the will the cause, and action the effect, if there is correspondence, then heavenly 
love flows into the will, and the will into the action, and they so act as a one that by means of the correspondence the action is as it were the love; or as when the faith of charity is the end, thought 
the cause, and speech the effect, then if there is correspondence, faith from charity flows into the thought, and this into the speech, and they so act as a one, that by means of the correspondence 
the speech is as it were the end. In order however that the end, which is love and faith, may produce the cause, which is will and thought, it must take to itself administrant means in the rational 
mind that will correspond; for without administrant means that correspond, the end, which is love or faith, cannot be received, however much it may flow in from the Lord through heaven. From this it 
is plain that the interiors and the exteriors of man, that is, what is rational, natural, and sensuous in him must be brought into correspondence, in order that he may receive the Divine influx, and consequently 
that he may be born again; and that it is not well with him till then. This is the reason why here by "when it is well with thee" is signified correspondence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5131</b></p><p><b>5131.</b>
'When it is well with you' means when a correspondence exists. This is clear from the meaning - when the subject is the rebirth or regeneration of the exterior natural or sensory power - of 'being well 
with you' as a correspondence that exists, for until that power corresponds things are not well with it. What correspondence is may be seen at the ends of chapters. There is a correspondence of sensory 
impressions with natural ideas, a correspondence of natural ideas with spiritual realities, a correspondence of spiritual realities with celestial entities, and finally a correspondence of celestial 
entities with the Lord's Divine. Thus a sequence of correspondences exists extending from the Divine down to the last and lowest degree of the natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since it is difficult for anyone to have 
any conception of the nature of correspondences if he has not previously given any thought to them, a brief statement must therefore be made about them. It is well known from philosophy that the end 
is prior to the cause, and the cause prior to the effect. To enable end, cause, and effect to follow one another and act as one, the effect must correspond to the cause, and the cause must correspond 
to the end. Nevertheless the end does not manifest itself as the cause, nor does the cause manifest itself as the effect. Rather, to enable the cause to exist the end must act on the level where the 
cause belongs, calling on assistant means to help it - the end - to bring the cause into existence; and to enable the effect to exist the cause likewise must act on the level where the effect belongs, 
by calling on assistant means to help it - the cause - to bring the effect into existence. These assistant means are ones that correspond; and because they correspond, the end can exist within the 
cause and bring the cause into operation, and the cause can exist within the effect and bring the effect into operation. Consequently the end uses the cause to bring the effect into operation. But it 
is different when no correspondence exists. In this case the end does not have a cause in which it may exist, let alone any effect in which it may do so. Instead the end undergoes change and variation 
within the cause, and finally within the effect, according to the form which the assistant means create. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 All things without exception within the human being, indeed all things without exception 
in the natural creation, follow one another as end, cause, and effect. When these correspond to one another in this way they act as one, for in this case the end is the all in all of the cause, and 
through the cause is the all in all of the effect. Take for example heavenly love, when this is the end, the will is the cause, and action is the effect. If the three exist in correspondence with one 
another - that love flowing into the will, and the will into action - they then act as one, so much so through their correspondence with one another that the action is seen as the love. Or take for another 
example faith grounded in charity. When this is the end, thought is the cause, and conversation is the effect. If the three exist in correspondence with one another - if faith grounded in charity 
is flowing into a person's thought, and this into his conversation - they then act as one, so much so that through their correspondence with one another his conversation is seen as if it were the end. 
But to enable the cause to exist, which is will or thought, the end, which is love or faith, must call on assistant means within the rational mind which must correspond. For without the corresponding 
assistant means the end, which is love and faith, has nothing to receive it, even though it flows in from the Lord through heaven. From this it is evident that both the interior and the exterior aspects 
of the human being, that is, his rational concepts, natural ideas, and sensory impressions, must be brought into a state of correspondence so that the Divine can flow in and be received by a person, 
consequently so that he may be born again, prior to which all is not well with him. From all this one may see that 'when it is well with you' here means [when] a correspondence exists. </p>

</p><b>5131.</b>
`Quando bene est tibi':  quod significet cum correspondentia, constat ex significatione `bene esse tibi', cum agitur de renascentia seu regeneratione exterioris naturalis seu sensualis, quod sit 
correspondentia, prius enim non ei bene est quam cum correspondet; quid correspondentia, ad finem capitum videatur; est {1} correspondentia sensualium cum naturalibus, et est correspondentia naturalium 
cum spiritualibus, et est correspondentia spiritualium cum caelestibus, et denique est correspondentia caelestium cum Divino Domino ita est successivum correspondentiarum a Divino usque ad ultimum 
naturale.  [2] Quia aegre potest formari idea de correspondentiis quales sunt, ab illis qui prius de correspondentiis nihil cogitaverunt, ideo paucis dicendum: notum est ex {2}philosophia quod 
finis sit primum causae et quod causa sit primum effectus; ut finis, causa et effectus consequantur et unum agant, oportet ut effectus correspondeat causae, et causa correspondeat fini; sed usque 
finis non apparet sicut causa, nec causa sicut effectus; ut enim finis producat causam, adsciscet ex regione ubi causa, media administra per quae finis faciet causam; et ut causa producat effectum, 
adsciscet quoque ex regione ubi effectus, media administra per quae causa faciat effectum; haec media administra sunt quae correspondent; et quia correspondent, potest finis esse in causa et agere 
causam, et causa esse in effectu et agere effectum, consequenter finis per causam agere effectum; aliter vero cum non correspondentia est, tunc finis non habet causam in qua sit, minus effectum in 
quo sit, sed mutatur et variatur finis in causa, et denique in effectu, secundum formam quam faciunt media administra.  [3] Omnia et singula in homine, immo omnia et singula in natura, succedunt sibi sicut 
finis, causa et effectus, et cum sibi ita correspondent, tunc unum agunt, nam finis tunc est omne in omnibus causae, et per causam omne in omnibus effectus: sicut pro exemplo, cum amor caelestis 
est finis, voluntas causa, et actio effectus, si correspondentia sit, tunc amor ille influit in voluntatem, et voluntas in actionem, et ita unum agunt, ut actio per correspondentiam sit quasi 
amor; vel sicut cum fides charitatis est finis, cogitatio causa, et sermo effectus; si correspondentia sit, tunc fides ex charitate influit in cogitationem, et haec in sermonem, ac ita unum agunt, 
ut sermo per correspondentiam sit quasi finis; ut aurem finis qui est amor aut fides, producat causam quae est voluntas et cogitatio, adsciscet media administra in mente rationali quae correspondebunt, 
nam absque mediis administris quae correspondeant, non potest finis, {3}qui est amor aut fides, utcumque a Domino per caelum influit recipi. Inde patet quod interiora et exteriora hominis, 
hoc est, rationalia, naturalia et sensualia ejus, in correspondentiam redigenda sint ut recipere possit influxum Divinum, consequenter ut homo possit renasci, et quod prius ei non bene sit. Inde nunc 
est quod hic per `quando bene est tibi' significatur correspondentia. @1 i enim$ @2 philosophicis$ @3 hoc est, amor et fides$ </p>
