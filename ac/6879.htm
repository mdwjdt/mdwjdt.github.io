<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6879节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6879.</strong>“神对摩西说”表第一次教导。这从“神说”的含义清楚可知，“神说”，在此是对摩西说（摩西代表神性真理方面的主），并且祂通过摩西向百姓说（也就是，通过从主的神性人身发出的神性真理向那些属于属灵教会的人说），是指教导，在此是指第一次教导，因为所论述的主题是要受到敬拜的真神。事实上，教会的第一个特征是承认一位神的存在，并且祂要受到敬拜。关于祂当知道的第一件事是，祂创造了宇宙，并且一切受造物或整个受造宇宙都凭祂而保持存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6879</b></p><p><b>6879.</b>
And God said unto Moses. That this signifies the first instruction, is evident from the signification of "God said" (here to Moses, by whom is represented the Lord as to the Divine truth, and from Moses 
to the people, thus from the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human, to those of the spiritual church), as being instruction, here the first instruction, because it is in regard to God 
Himself who is to be worshiped. For the first of the church is the knowledge that there is a God, and that He is to be worshiped. His first quality to be known is that He created the universe, and 
that the created universe subsists from Him. </p>

'And God said to Moses' means the instruction that is provided first. This is clear from the meaning of 'God's saying', at this point His saying to Moses (who represents the Lord in respect of Divine 
Truth) and His saying through Moses to the people (that is, speaking through the Divine Truth going forth from the Lord's Divine Human to those who belong to the spiritual Church) as instruction, in 
this case the instruction that is provided first since the true God who is to be worshipped is the subject. For the first feature of the Church is that God exists and that He is to be worshipped. The 
first thing about Him that one should know is that He has created all things and that every created thing is kept in being by Him. </p>

</p><b>6879.</b>
`Et dixit Deus ad Moschen {1}': quod significet instructionem primam, constat ex significatione `dicere Deus,' hic ad Moschen, per quem repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, et a Mosche ad populum, 
ita a Divino Vero procedente a Divino Humano Domini ad illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quod sit instructio, hic prima quia agitur de Ipso Deo Qui colendus; primum enim Ecclesiae est cognitio quod 
Deus sit, et quod Ille colendus; quale Ipsius primum quod sciendum, est quod creaverit universum, et quod universum creatum ab Ipso subsistat. 	@1 i but not d ita dicas ad filios Israelis cp n. 6873.$ </p>
