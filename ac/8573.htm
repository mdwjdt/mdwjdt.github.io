<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8573节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8573.</strong>“摩西就呼求耶和华说”表深切的悲伤和代求。这从“呼求”的含义清楚可知，当论及人们在痛苦和悲伤中所要求的神性帮助时，“呼求”是指深切的悲伤（参看<a href="7782.htm">7782</a>节），以及代求（<a href="8179.htm">8179</a>节）。由于“摩西呼求耶和华”表示“摩西”所代表的神性真理的代求，故必须简要阐述一下何为代求及其性质。不知道何为代求的人不可能对它形成任何概念，只是认为主不断向父祷告，为虔诚祈求并承诺悔改的罪人代求。事实上，简单人会以为主与父坐在一起，为罪人向父求情，恳求祂将这个罪人赐给自己，好叫此人能在祂的国度里享有永恒的幸福。对于圣言中所提到的代求，许多人都持有这种观念；在圣言中，经上说主会为他们祈求祂的父。但谁看不出这些话是照着人类的思维观念来说的？事实上，那个时候，和今天的许多人一样，每个人都只能像思想地上的国度那样思想天国，因为他们通过后者获得对前者的概念。这一点从主的门徒自己很明显地看出来，即雅各和约翰要求在祂的国里，一个坐在祂右边，一个坐在祂左边（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.35.htm">10:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.37.htm">37</a>）；这一点也可从其余的门徒明显看出来，他们起了争论，即在祂的国中，他们当中哪一个算为最大，于是主对他们说，他们要在祂的国里，坐在祂的席上吃喝，并且坐在宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.24.htm">22:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">30</a>），因此他们要与祂同作王。很明显，祂所说的这些话适合他们的思维方式，因而适合他们的理解力；但就内层意义而言，这些话却有不同的含义，这在当时是无法让人们知道的。至于门徒所要坐的“十二个宝座”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）。<br />至于代求的性质，情况是这样：一切爱都含有代求在里面，一切怜悯也是如此，因为怜悯是爱的特征。凡有爱或有怜悯之心的人都在不断代求，这一点从下面的例子可以看出来：一个爱妻子的丈夫希望妻子能受到别人的友好接待，并得到很好的对待；他没有用实际的话语来表达自己的愿望，但却不断思想它，因此在默默地祈求它，为妻子代求。父母对待他们所爱的孩子也是这样。那些处于仁爱的人对自己的邻舍，以及那些处于友情的人对待自己的朋友同样如此。这些例子表明，代求不断存在于一切爱中。主为人类，尤其为那些处于信之良善和真理的人代求也是如此；因为神性，也就是无限的爱向他们显示；神性，也就是无限的怜悯也向他们显示。倒不是说主为他们向父祷告，以这种方式代求，因为这样祂就会以一种完全人性化的方式行事。相反，祂不断原谅，不断宽恕，因为祂不断怜恤人；这一切是主自己做的，因为主与父为一（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.8.htm">14:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.12.htm">12</a>）。<br />“代求”这个词里面还隐藏着一个更深的奥秘，也必须提一下这个奥秘。从主发出的神性真理不断以上述方式代求，因为它从神性之爱发出。<br />当主在世时，祂是神性真理；但由于祂得了荣耀，这荣耀是在祂复活时实现的，所以祂是神性良善（<a href="7499.htm">7499</a>节）。在圣言中，“父”在内义上所表示的，就是神性良善；“子”所表示的，则是神性真理（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="7499.htm">7499</a>节）。由于从神性良善发出的神性真理含有不断的代求在里面，所以经上说子祈求父，并为人代求。这后一种观念能被人理解，但前一种观念很难被人理解。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8573</b></p><p><b>8573.</b>
And Moses cried unto Jehovah. That this signifies interior lamentation and intercession, is evident from the signification of "crying," when for Divine aid, which the people demanded by reason of their 
grievous suffering, as being interior lamentation (see n. 7782), and also intercession (n. 8179). As by "Moses crying unto Jehovah" is signified intercession by the Divine truth which is represented 
by Moses, it shall be briefly told what intercession is, and how the case is in respect to it. They who do not know what intercession is, cannot form any other idea about it than that the Lord continually 
prays to the Father, and intercedes for the sinner who devoutly supplicates and promises repentance. Nay, the simple think that the Lord sits with the Father, and pleads with Him for the sinner, 
and entreats Him to give him to Himself, that he may be in His kingdom, and may enjoy eternal happiness. Such an idea have very many about the intercession spoken of in the Word, where it is said that 
the Lord will entreat His Father for them. But who cannot see that these things were said according to the ideas of human thought? For everyone at that time, as also very many at this day, could not 
think otherwise of the heavenly kingdom, than as they think of an earthly kingdom, because they get the idea about the former from the latter. This is plainly evident from those very apostles of the 
Lord, James and John, who asked to sit the one on His right hand, and the other on His left, in His kingdom (Mark 10:35-37); and also from the rest of the apostles, among whom there was a contention 
as to which of them should be the greatest in the Lord's kingdom, and who were therefore told by the Lord that they should eat and drink at His table in His kingdom, and should sit on thrones judging 
the twelve tribes of Israel (Luke 22:24, 30), thus that they should reign with Him. It is evident that these things were said in accordance with their ideas, and thus in accordance with their apprehension, 
and that in the interior sense they have a different signification, which at that time could not so well be made known. (What "the twelve thrones" signify on which the apostles were to sit, see 
n. 2129, 6397.) [2] As regards intercession, the case is this. There is intercession in all love, consequently in all mercy; for mercy is of love. That he who loves, or who feels compassion, continually 
intercedes, can be seen from examples. A husband who loves his wife, wishes her to be kindly received by others, and to be well treated; he does not say this in express terms, but continually thinks 
it, consequently is in silence continually entreating it, and interceding for her. Parents act in like manner in favor of their children whom they love. In like manner do those also who are in charity 
for their neighbor; and they who are in friendship for their friends. From all this it can be seen that there is constant intercession in all love. It is the same in respect to the Lord's intercession 
for the human race, and in especial for those who are in the good and truth of faith; for toward them there is Divine, that is, infinite love; and there is Divine, that is, infinite mercy. He does 
not pray the Father for them, and in this way intercede, for this would be to act altogether after a human manner; but He continually excuses, and continually forgives, for He continually feels compassion; 
and this is done on the part of the Lord Himself, for the Lord and the Father are one (John 14:8-12). [3] A secret that lies still more interiorly hidden in the word "intercession," shall also 
be told. The Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord continually intercedes in the manner described, because it proceeds from the Divine love. When the Lord was in the world He was the Divine truth; 
but since He was glorified, which was effected when He rose again, He is the Divine good (n. 7499). It is the Divine good which is meant in the Word in the internal sense by "the Father," and the Divine 
truth which is meant by "the Son" (n. 2803, 3704, 7499). And as in the Divine truth, which proceeds from the Divine good, there is continual intercession, therefore it is said that the Son entreats 
the Father, and intercedes for man. This latter idea could be apprehended by man, but the former with difficulty. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8573</b></p><p><b>8573.</b>
'And Moses cried out to Jehovah, [saying]' means deep grief, and intercession. This is clear from the meaning of 'crying out' - when it refers to the Divine aid which the people demanded in their misery 
and grief - as deep grief, as also previously in <a href="7782.htm">7782</a>, and intercession, as in <a href="8179.htm">8179</a>. Since 'Moses cried out to Jehovah' means intercession by Divine Truth, which 'Moses' represents, what intercession 
is and the nature of it must be stated briefly. People who do not know what intercession is can have no other conception of it than this, that the Lord constantly prays to the Father and intercedes 
for the sinner who pleads in a devout manner and promises to repent. Indeed the simple think that the Lord sits with the Father and speaks to Him about a sinner, asking the Father to give Him that sinner 
to be in His kingdom and possess eternal happiness. An idea such as this is what very many have about intercession referred to in the Word, where it says that the Lord will entreat the Father on 
their behalf. But who can fail to see that human ways of thinking were being used in what was said? For everyone at that time, like very many also at the present day, could think of a heavenly kingdom 
only as they think of an earthly kingdom. The latter serves them to gain an idea of the former. This is plainly evident from the Lord's apostles themselves - from James and John, who asked to sit one 
on His right, the other on His left in His kingdom, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:35-37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:35-37</a>; and also from the rest of the apostles, among whom a quarrel arose over which of them was to be greatest in His kingdom, and to whom 
the Lord said that they would eat and drink at His table in His kingdom, and that they would sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:24,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:24, 30</a>, and therefore that they would reign with 
Him. The things He said, it is evident, were adapted to their way of thinking and so to their ability to grasp them; but in the interior sense those things had a different meaning, which could not 
be made known at that time What twelve thrones with the apostles seated on them mean, see <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the nature of intercession, all love holds intercession within it, and so does 
all mercy since mercy is the characteristic of love. Anyone who has love or who has mercy is interceding constantly, as the following examples demonstrate: The husband who loves his wife wishes her to 
be well-received and well-treated by others. He does not express his wish in actual words, but it is constantly in his thinking, so that he is silently requesting it and interceding for her. Parents 
do the same thing for their children whom they love. It is likewise what a person governed by charity does for his neighbour, and what one moved by friendship does for a friend. These examples show that 
intercession is present unceasingly in all love. The same is true of the Lord's intercession for the human race, especially for those with whom the goodness and truth of faith are present; for towards 
them Divine - that is, infinite - love is shown, and Divine - that is, infinite - mercy. Not that the Lord prays to the Father for them and intercedes in that way; for then He would be acting in an 
entirely human manner. Rather He is constantly excusing and constantly forgiving, because He is constantly showing mercy; this the Lord Himself is doing since the Lord and the Father are one, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:8-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:8-12</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
An arcanum that lies even more deeply concealed within the word 'intercession' must also be mentioned. Divine Truth which emanates from the Lord intercedes constantly in such a way because 
it emanates from Divine Love. While the Lord was in the world He was Divine Truth; but now that He has been glorified, which was accomplished when He rose again, He is Divine Good, <a href="7499.htm">7499</a>. Divine Good 
is what is meant in the Word in the internal sense by 'the Father', and Divine Truth by 'the Son', <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="7499.htm">7499</a>. And since Divine Truth, which emanates from Divine Good, holds constant intercession 
within it, the Son is said to entreat the Father and to intercede for a person. People were able to grasp the latter notion of the Son, but the former idea of Divine Truth only with difficulty. </p>

`Et clamavit Moscheh ad Jehovam [, dicendo]': quod significet lamentationem interiorem et intercessionem, constat ex significatione `clamare' cum de ope Divina, quam populus ex gravi indolentia {1}flagitabat, 
quod sit lamentatio interior, ut quoque prius n. 7782, atque intercessio, ut n. 8179.  Quia per `clamavit Moscheh ad Jehovam' significatur intercessio a Divino Vero, quod per `Moschen' repraesentatur, 
paucis dicendum quid sit intercessio {2}, et quomodo cum illa se habet: qui {3} non sciunt quid intercessio, non aliam sibi ideam de {4}illa sistere possunt quam quod Dominus continue oret 
Patrem et intercedat pro peccatore qui devote supplicat et paenitentiam pollicetur; immo simplices cogitant quod Dominus sedeat apud Patrem, et loquatur cum Ipso de peccatore, et quod roget Ipsum ut 
{5}det illum Sibi, ut sit in regno Suo, et {6}potiatur felicitate aeterna; talem ideam habent perplures de intercessione, de qua in Verbo, ubi dicitur quod Dominus rogabit Patrem Suum pro illis; sed quis 
non videre potest quod haec dicta sint secundum ideas cogitationis humanae? nam unusquisque illo tempore, sicut et perplures hodie, non aliter potuerunt cogitare de regno caelesti quam sicut cogitant 
de regno terrestri, ab hoc enim capitur idea de illo, ut manifeste patet ab ipsis apostolis Domini, Jacobo et Johanne, qui petierunt ut unus sederet a dextris, alter a sinistris in regno Ipsius, Marc. 
x 35-37; {7}et quoque a reliquis apostolis, inter quos quia contentio facta est quis illorum major futurus est in regno Domini, quibus Dominus ideo dixit quod (x)comederent et biberent super mensa 
Sua in regno Suo, et quod sederent super thronis judicantes duodecim tribus Israelis, Luc. xxii 24, 30, proinde quod regnarent cum Ipso; {8} haec quod secundum ideam ac ita secundum captum {9}illorum 
dicta sint, et quod significent in interiore sensu aliud, quod non ita tunc potuit propalari, patet; quid duodecim throni, super quibus apostoli, significant, videatur n. 2129, 6397. 	2 Cum intercessione 
ita se habet: in omni amore est intercessio, proinde in omni misericordia, nam misericordia est amoris; quod qui amat aut qui miseretur continue intercedat, constare potest ab exemplis: maritus 
qui amat uxorem vult ut ab aliis benigne recipiatur utque ei benefiat; hoc non apertis verbis dicit sed continue id cogitat, proinde id continue tacite rogat et pro illa intercedit; similiter faciunt 
parentes pro liberis suis quos amant; pariter qui in charitate sunt ita faciunt pro proximo, et qui in amicitia pro {10}amico; ex his constare potest quod intercessio insit omni amori jugiter; similiter 
se habet cum intercessione Domini pro humano genere, et in specie pro illis qui in bono et vero fidei sunt, nam erga illos est Divinus, hoc est, infinitus amor, et est Divina, hoc est, infinita misericordia; 
nec orat Patrem pro illis et sic intercedit, nam hoc foret prorsus humano more agere, sed continue excusat et continue remittit, nam continue miseretur, et hoc fit apud Ipsum Dominum, nam 
Dominus et Pater unum sunt, Joh. xiv 8-12. 	3 Arcanum quod adhuc interius latet in Verbo intercessionis, etiam dicetur: Divinum Verum, quod procedit a Domino, intercedit tali modo continue, quia procedit 
a Divino Amore; Dominus cum in mundo fuit, Divinum Verum fuit, (x)at cum glorificatus est, quod factum cum resurrexit, Divinum Bonum est, n. 7499; Divinum Bonum est quod in Verbo in sensu interno 
intelligitur per `Patrem,' et Divinum Verum per `Filium,' n. 2803, 3704, 7499; et quia inest Divino Vero, quod procedit a Divino Bono, intercessio continua, {11}ideo dicitur quod Filius roget Patrem, 
et intercedat pro homine; hoc capi potuit ab homine, {12}ast illud aegre. 	@1 flagitat$ 	@2 i in sensu interno$ 	@3 i hoc$ 	@4 intercessione$ 	@5 After Sibi$ 	@6 ibi in$ 	@7 et a reliquis apostolis,
