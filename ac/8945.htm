<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8945节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8945.</strong>“你上我的坛，不可用台阶”表不可把自己提升至更内在的层级，也就是属天层级。这从“用台阶上”和“坛”的含义清楚可知：“用台阶上”是指把自己提升至更高或更内在的层级，无论你说“更内在”还是“更高”，意思都一样，因为更内在的事物看上去就像更高的事物（参看<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>，<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>，<a href="4599.htm">4599</a>节）；“坛”是指主的主要代表（<a href="921.htm">921</a>，<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>节）。因此，“用台阶上我的坛”表示将自己提升到主那里，因而提升至更内在的层级，也就是属天层级；因为在更内在的层级，主的同在更大。那些在至内层天堂的事物被称为“属天的”，那些在中间天堂的事物则被称为“属灵的”。因为天堂分为两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度。在属天国度的天使在至内层或第三层天堂，因而离主最近；因为那里的天使处于对主之爱，拥有纯真，因而在智慧上胜过其他所有天使。但在属灵国度的天使在中间或第二层天堂，因而离主较远；那里的天使处于对邻之仁，并通过仁而与主同住。关于这两个国度，以及它们之间的区别，可参看前文（<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2227.htm">2227</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="3235.htm">3235</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3374.htm">3374</a>，<a href="3887.htm">3887</a>，<a href="4448.htm">4448</a>，<a href="4585.htm">4585</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>，<a href="4939.htm">4939</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6367.htm">6367</a>，<a href="6435.htm">6435</a>，<a href="7877.htm">7877</a>节）。<br />有必要用几句话解释一下“用台阶上坛”所表示的把自己提升至更内在的层级，也就是属天层级是怎么回事。在来世，谁也不允许被提升到比他所在的良善层级还要高的那个层级而进入天堂。如果他被提升到某个更高层级，他的污秽，也就是他所爱的邪恶和由此而来的虚假就会显露出来；因为越是内在的事物，它在天上就越纯洁和神圣。那些状态不怎么纯洁的人就被保持在一个较低的气场中；在那里，他们的不洁不被注意或不明显，因为这些人处在更粗劣的良善和更模糊的真理之中。<br />有时那些进入天堂的人强烈渴望上到更内在的天堂，以为如此他们就会享受更大的喜乐。为消除粘附于他们的这种强烈渴望，他们真的被提升到一个更内在的天堂；但当他们到了那里时，开始因他们所爱的邪恶而感到痛苦；那时，这些邪恶被他们发觉；他们也因着源于与他们同在的邪恶的虚假而明显变丑。意识到这些事后，他们从更内在的天堂跌落，直到回到原先的位置才恢复宁静和平安的状态。这些就是“你上我的坛，不可用台阶，免得你的裸体在上头露出来”所表示的事。<br />这同样适用于天堂之下的人。如果这些人尚未做好准备就强烈渴望升入天堂，那么当被提升到那里时，他们就会感到几乎地狱般的折磨，觉得自己就像死尸。他们的生命变得吃力，就像垂死挣扎者的生命。因此，他们从那里一头栽下去，之后再也不渴望上升超越他们所在的生命状态了。<br />要知道，在来世，主不拒绝任何人进入天堂；只要愿意，人们随时可以进入。天堂是由处于爱主爱邻之良善的天使社群组成的；当被引入天堂时，人们就被允许进入这类天使的社群。但当他们的生命气场，也就是他们的爱之生命不一致时，冲突就会产生，他们由此感到痛苦，并从那里跌落。他们通过这种经历了解天堂的生命，以及对比之下他们自己的生命状态，还了解到这一事实：没有人如世人所普遍认为的那样，仅凭被接受或获准进入而拥有天堂；而且一个人必须通过他在世上的生活具备这样的品性：他变得适合与天上的天使在一起。关于通过经历对这些问题的阐述和说明，可参看前文（<a href="3938.htm">3938</a>，<a href="4225.htm">4225</a>，<a href="4226.htm">4226</a>，<a href="4299.htm">4299</a>，<a href="4674.htm">4674</a>，<a href="5057.htm">5057</a>，<a href="5058.htm">5058</a>，<a href="7186.htm">7186</a>，<a href="7519.htm">7519</a>，<a href="8794.htm">8794</a>，<a href="8797.htm">8797</a>节）。这些就是“你上我的坛，不可用台阶，免得你的裸体在上头露出来”这条律例，以及另一条类似律例（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.42.htm">28:42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.43.htm">43</a>）所表示的事<br />经上之所以说“用台阶上”，是因为提升至内层在灵人界可以看到；在那里，属天和属灵事物以类似于世上的形式呈现，如通过台阶上升。我常蒙允许看见这种代表性的景象。也正因如此，雅各梦见天使通过梯子的阶梯上到主那里（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.12.htm">28:12</a>）。故在圣言中，“台阶”也表示上到高层或内层（如以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.6.htm">40:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.34.htm">34</a>）；阿摩司书：<br />主万军之耶和华在天上建造祂的台阶。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.6.htm">9:6</a>）</p>

And thou shalt not go up on steps unto the altar. That this signifies no elevation to interior things which are celestial, is evident from the signification of "going up by steps," as being to raise 
oneself to higher or interior things (whether we say "interior things," or "higher things," it is the same, for interior things appear as higher, see n. 2148, 3084, 4210, 4599); and from the signification 
of "an altar," as being the chief representative of the Lord (n. 921, 2777, 2811); thus by "going up on steps unto Mine altar" is signified to raise oneself to the Lord, consequently to interior 
things which are celestial; for the Lord is more present in interior things. Those things are called celestial which are in the inmost heaven, and those spiritual which are in the middle heaven. For heaven 
is distinguished into two kingdoms, namely, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. They who are in the celestial kingdom are in the inmost or third heaven, thus nearest to the Lord; for 
they who are there are in love to the Lord and in innocence, consequently in wisdom above all the other angels. But they who are in the spiritual kingdom are in the middle or second heaven, thus more 
remote from the Lord; they who are there are in charity toward the neighbor, and through charity are with the Lord. (Concerning these two kingdoms and the difference between them, see n. 2048, 2088, 
2227, 2507, 2669, 2708, 2715, 2718, 3235, 3246, 3374, 3887, 4448, 4585, 4938, 4939, 5113, 5922, 6367, 6435, 7877.) [2] It is to be explained in a few words how the case is with respect to the elevation 
toward interior things, thus toward celestial things, which is signified by "going up on steps unto the altar." It is not granted anyone in the other life to be raised higher into heaven than to the 
degree of good in which he is; for if he is raised higher, his defilements, that is, the evils of his loves and the falsities therefrom, are made manifest. For the more interior, the more pure and 
holy, it is in heaven. They who are in a more impure state are kept in a lower sphere, where their impurities are not perceived and do not appear, because they are in a grosser good, and a more obscure 
truth. [3] It sometimes happens that they who come into heaven desire to come into a more interior heaven, believing that so they will enjoy greater joy. In order that this desire which clings to them 
may be removed, they are indeed raised into a more interior heaven; but when they come thither, they begin to be distressed by reason of the evils of their loves, which evils then come to their perception, 
and they also become ugly by reason of the falsities from the evils with them. On perceiving these things, they cast themselves down from the more interior heaven, and do not return into a tranquil 
and peaceful state until they come into their former station. These are the things which are signified by the statute, "Thou shalt not go up on steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not 
uncovered upon it." [4] The case is similar with those who are beneath heaven. If these desire to ascend into heaven before they have been prepared, when they are raised there they feel torment almost 
infernal, and appear to themselves like carcasses. Even the very life with them labors, like the life of those who are in the death agony; and therefore they cast themselves down headlong, and afterward 
no more desire to ascend above the state of life in which they are. [5] Be it known that in the other life heaven is denied by the Lord to no one, and that as many as desire can be admitted. (Heaven 
consists of societies of angels who are in the good of love toward the neighbor and of love to the Lord; and when any are admitted into heaven, they are let into such societies.) But when the sphere 
of their life, that is, when the life of their love, is not in agreement, then conflict arises, from which they have anguish and downcasting. In this way they are instructed about the life of heaven, 
and the state of their own life in comparison, also about the fact that no one has heaven merely by being received or admitted (as is the common opinion in the world), and that by his life in the 
world a man may become of such a character that he can be with those who are in heaven (see what has been already said and shown on this subject from experience, n. 3938, 4225, 4226, 4299, 4674, 5057, 
5058, 7186, 7519, 8794, 8797). These are the things which are signified by the statute, "Thou shalt not go up on steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered upon it;" and also by a similar 
statute in Exod. 28:42, 43. [6] It is said "go up on steps," for the reason that elevation to interior things appears in the world of spirits, where celestial and spiritual things are presented 
in forms like those of the world, as an ascent by steps. This representative it has often been given me to see. For this reason also it was that the angels were seen by Jacob in his dream going up to 
the Lord by the steps of a ladder (Gen. 28:12). Therefore also by "steps" in the Word is signified ascent to higher things, that is, to interior things, as in Ezekiel 40:6, 22, 26, 31, 34; and in Amos: </p>
<p> 
    The Lord Jehovih Zebaoth buildeth His steps in the heavens (Amos 9:6). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8945</b></p><p><b>8945.</b>
'And you shall not go up to My altar by steps' means not raising themselves to more internal levels, that is, celestial ones. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up by means of steps' as raising 
oneself to higher or more internal levels (whether you say more internal or higher it amounts to the same thing, since more internal things are seen as higher ones, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>, <a href="3084.htm">3084</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>, <a href="4599.htm">4599</a>); and from 
the meaning of 'altar' as the chief representative of the Lord, dealt with in <a href="921.htm">921</a>, <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="2811.htm">2811</a>. Thus 'going up by steps to My altar' means raising oneself to the Lord, consequently to more internal levels, 
which are celestial ones; for the Lord's presence is greater on mom internal levels. The term 'celestial' is used for things in the inmost heaven, but 'spiritual' for those in the middle heaven. 
For heaven is divided into two kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. Those in the celestial kingdom are in the inmost or third heaven, and so are nearest the Lord; for they are governed 
by love to the Lord, possessing innocence and consequently wisdom in greater measure than all the rest. But those who are in the spiritual kingdom are in the middle or second heaven, and so are 
more remote from the Lord; and those there am governed by charity towards the neighbour, and through charity dwell with the Lord. Regarding those two kingdoms and the difference between them, see <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2227.htm">2227</a>, <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>, <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="3235.htm">3235</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3374.htm">3374</a>, <a href="3887.htm">3887</a>, <a href="4448.htm">4448</a>, <a href="4585.htm">4585</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>, <a href="4939.htm">4939</a>, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6367.htm">6367</a>, <a href="6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="7877.htm">7877</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let a brief explanation be given of what is implied by raising oneself 
towards more internal levels, that is, celestial ones, which is meant by 'going up by steps to the altar'. No one in the next life is allowed to be raised into heaven to a level higher than that of 
the good which governs him. If he is raised to some higher level the foul things about him are revealed, that is, the evils he loves, and the resulting falsities; for the more internal something is, the 
purer and holier it is in heaven. Those whose state is not so pure are kept in a lower sphere in which impurities go unnoticed or are not apparent; for such people are governed by grosser good and 
guided by duller truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Sometimes it happens that those coming into heaven have a strong desire to go to a more internal heaven, believing that by doing this they will experience greater joy. To 
the end that this strong desire which clings to them may be removed, they are indeed raised to a more internal heaven. But when they get there they start to feel anguished, on account of those evils 
they love which are then perceptible to them; they also become visibly disfigured on account of the falsities that spring from the evils residing with them. Having perceived these things they cast themselves 
down from the more internal heaven, and do not attain a calm and peaceful state until they return to the position they occupied previously. These are the things that are meant by 'you shall not 
go up to My altar by steps, in order that your nakedness may not be revealed on it'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The same applies to those below heaven, if they have a strong desire to rise to heaven before they have been 
prepared for it. When they are raised there they feel torment almost hellish and seem to themselves to be like dead bodies. Their life becomes laboured, like that of those in the throes of death. 
Therefore they cast themselves down headlong from there, and after that no longer have any desire to rise above the state of life in which they live. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It should be recognized that the Lord refuses 
heaven to no one in the next life, and that people can be allowed in as often as they wish. Heaven consists of communities of angels, who are governed by the good of love towards the neighbour and 
of love to the Lord. When introduced into heaven people are let into communities of such angels. But when the sphere of their life, that is, the life of their love, is out of agreement, conflict arises, 
as a result of which they feel anguished and cast themselves down from there. From this experience they learn about the life of heaven, and about the condition of their own life in comparison. They 
also learn from it that heaven does not become anyone's simply by his being received or let in, as the common idea is in the world, and also that a person must live in such a way in the world that he 
becomes fit to be with those in heaven. But see what has already been stated and shown from experience previously regarding these matters, in <a href="3938.htm">3938</a>, <a href="4225.htm">4225</a>, <a href="4226.htm">4226</a>, <a href="4299.htm">4299</a>, <a href="4674.htm">4674</a>, <a href="5057.htm">5057</a>, <a href="5058.htm">5058</a>, <a href="7186.htm">7186</a>, <a href="7519.htm">7519</a>, <a href="8794.htm">8794</a>, 
<a href="8797.htm">8797</a>. These are the considerations which are meant by the regulation that they must not go up by steps to the altar, in order that their nakedness may not be revealed on it, and also by a similar regulation 
at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:42,%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:42, 43</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The words 'going up by steps' are used because a raising to more internal levels is seen in the world of spirits - where celestial and spiritual realities are presented 
within forms similar to those in the world - as raising oneself by means of steps. I have often been allowed to see this representative sight. So it was too that in a dream Jacob saw angels going 
up to the Lord by the steps of a stairway, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:12</a>. Therefore also by 'steps' in the Word is meant going up to higher, that is, more internal levels, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezekiel%2040:6,%2022,%2026,%2031,%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezekiel 40:6, 22, 26, 31, 34</a>; and in Amos, </p>
<blockquote>

Lord Jehovih Zebaoth builds His steps in the heavens. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:6</a>.

`Et non ascendes in gradibus super ad altare Meum': quod significet non elevationem ad interiora quae caelestia, constat ex significatione `ascendere per gradus' quod sit elevare se ad superiora seu 
ad interiora; sive dicas interiora sive superiora, idem est, nam interiora apparent sicut superiora, n. 2148, 3084, 4210, 4599; et ex significatione `altaris' quod sit principale repraesentativum Domini, 
de qua n. 921, 2777, 2811; ita {1} `ascendere in gradibus super ad altare Meum' est se elevare ad Dominum, proinde ad interiora quae caelestia, nam Dominus praesentior est in interioribus; caelestia 
dicuntur quae in intimo caelo, spiritualia autem quae in medio; caelum enim distinctum est in bina regna, nempe in regnum caeleste et in regnum spirituale; qui in regno caelesti sunt in intimo seu 
tertio caelo sunt, ita proximi Domino; qui enim ibi sunt in amore in Dominum sunt, et in innocentia, proinde in sapientia prae omnibus reliquis; at qui in regno spirituali sunt in medio seu secundo caelo 
sunt, ita remotiores a Domino; qui ibi sunt in charitate erga proximum sunt, et per charitatem apud Dominum; de binis illis regnis et de illorum differentia, videatur n. 2048, 2088, 2227, 2507, 2669, 
2708, 2715, 2718, 3235, 3246, 3374, 3887, 4448, 4585, 4938, 4939, 5113, 5922, 6367, 6435, 7877. 2	 Paucis explicandum est quomodo se habet cum elevatione versus interiora, ita ad caelestia, quae 
significantur per `ascendere in gradibus super ad altare': non conceditur alicui in altera vita altius in caelum elevari quam ad gradum boni in quo est, nam si altius, tunc manifestantur spurca ejus, 
hoc est, mala amorum ejus et falsa inde; quo enim interius est, eo purius et sanctius est in caelo; qui in impuriore statu  sunt,  illi  tenentur  in  sphaera  inferiore  ubi  impura  non percipiuntur 
nec apparent, sunt enim in bono crassiore et in vera obscuriore. 3	    Quandoque evenit quod qui in caelum veniunt cupiant venire in caelum interius; credunt quod sic fruituri majore gaudio; ut cupido 
illa quae inhaeret auferatur, elevantur etiam in caelum interius; sed cum eo veniunt, tunc incipiunt angi ex malis amorum suorum, quae tunc ad perceptionem veniunt, et quoque fiunt deformes ex falsis 
quae ex malis apud illos; his perceptis ex interiore caelo se dejiciunt; et non prius ad statum tranquillum et pacificum quam cum in stationem suam priorem, redeunt; haec sunt quae significantur per 
quod `non (x)ascendes in gradibus super ad altare Meum, ut non reveletur nuditas tua super illo.' 4	    Similiter se habet cum illis qui infra caelum sunt; illi si antequam praeparati cupiunt ascendere 
in caelum, cum illuc elevantur, sentiunt cruciatum paene infernalem et apparent sibi sicut cadavera; laborat etiam ipsa vita apud illos, sicut vita apud illos qui in agone mortis sunt; quare se 
praecipites inde dejiciunt, et postea non amplius cupiunt ascendere supra statum vitae in qua sunt. 5	     Sciendum est quod in altera vita nemini caelum a Domino negetur: et quod admitti queant quotcumque 
volunt; (caelum consistit ex societatibus angelorum, qui in bono amoris erga proximum et amoris in Dominum) in talium societates intromittuntur cum in caelum; sed cum sphaera vitae eorum, hoc est, 
cum vita amoris illorum, non concordat, tunc fit conflictus, inde angor illis et dejectio; ita instruuntur de vita caeli et de suaemet vitae statu respective, tum de eo quod caelum non sit alicui 
per quod recipiatur aut intromittatur prout communis opinio est in mundo, ut et quod homo per vitam in mundo talis fiet ut possit cum illis esse qui in caelo sunt; {2}sed videantur quae de his ab experientia 
prius dicta et ostensa sunt, n. 3938, 4225, 4226, 4299, 4674, 5057, 5058, 7186, 7519, 8794, 8797. Haec sunt quae significantur per hoc statutum quod `non in gradibus ascendent super ad altare, 
ne reveletur nuditas {3}sua super eo'; tum per simile Exod. xxviii 42, 43. 		`Ascendere in gradibus' dicitur ex causa quia elevatio ad interiora 6 apparet in mundo spirituum, ubi caelestia et spiritualia 
sistuntur in formis mundanarum similibus, sicut ascensus per gradus; hoc repraesentativum datum est saepius videre; inde quoque erat quod Jacobo in somno visi sint angeli ascendere ad Dominum per 
gradus scalae, Gen. xxviii 12; ideo quoque per `gradus' in Verbo significatur ascensus ad superiora, hoc est, interiora, ut apud Ezechielem xl 6, 22, 26, 31, 34; et apud Amos, Dominus Jehovih Zebaoth
