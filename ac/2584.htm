<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2584节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2584.</strong>“她们便能生育”表繁殖。这从“生产”和“生育”的含义清楚可知。就圣言的内义而言，所表示的无不是属灵和属天之物。因此，在提到“怀孕”或“成孕”，“生育”或“产出”，“分娩”或“出生”，“代”或“产生”，以及那些作为“父母”生出者，以及那些作为“儿女”出生者，所有这些无不是以灵义来表示的。因为圣言本身是属灵和属天的，这同样适用于此处的“生育”，它表示教义的繁殖。<br />在圣言中，“生育”只表示这类生育，而非别的生育。这一事实从以下经文明显看出来，撒母耳记：<br />饱足的，反作佣人求食；饥饿的，再不饥饿，不生育的，生了七个；多有儿女的，反倒衰微。耶和华拿走生命，也赐予生命；使人下阴间，也使人往上升。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.5.htm">2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.6.htm">6</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />生产七次的妇人力衰气绝；尚在白昼，其日就落。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.9.htm">15:9</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />不生育、不生养的啊，要歌唱，未经过产痛的要发声歌唱，扬声欢呼！因为凄凉独居者的儿女比有丈夫者的儿女还多，这是耶和华说的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.1.htm">54:1</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华的声音惊动母鹿落胎，森林也脱落净光。凡在他殿中的，都述说荣耀。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.9.htm">29:9</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />西顿哪，惭愧哦！因为大海说，就是海中的保障说，我没有受过产痛，也没有生产，没有养大过男孩，也没有使童女长大。这风声传到埃及，埃及人为推罗的风声极其疼痛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.4.htm">23:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.5.htm">5</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />她未曾阵痛就生产，未觉疼痛就生出男孩。这样的事谁曾听见？这样的事谁曾看见呢？地岂能一日而生，我岂不使她生产呢？这是耶和华说的；我既使她生产，岂能又使她闭胎呢？这是你的神说的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.7.htm">66:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.9.htm">9</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />你们去问问，去看看，男人能生产吗？我怎么看见人人用手掐腰，像正在生产的妇人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.6.htm">30:6</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />我必使火在埃及境内着起；训必翻腾绞痛；挪必定被攻破。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结30.16.htm">30:16</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />至于以法莲人，他们的荣耀必如鸟飞去，必不生产，不怀胎，不成孕。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.11.htm">9:11</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />分娩的疼痛必临到以法莲身上；他是无智慧之子，到了产期他还是迟延于子宫口。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />启示录：<br />有一个妇人，身披日头，脚踏月亮，头戴十二星的冠冕。她怀了孕，在苦劳和产痛中疼痛呼叫。龙就站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生出儿子之后，要吞吃她的孩子。妇人生了一个男孩子，是将来要用铁杖牧养列族的；但那孩子被提到神和祂的宝座那里去了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.5.htm">5</a>）<br />从上述经文谁都能看出，所表示的是教会的怀孕和生产，而非别的怀孕和生产？此处关于亚比米勒的论述，即“神就医好亚比米勒和他的妻子，以及他的女仆们，她们便能生育”和“因耶和华为亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉的缘故，关闭了亚比米勒家的一切子宫”，也是这种情况。通过对这些话的解读，就能清楚知道它们的内义表示什么，即通过神性真理看待信之教义时它是何性质，以及通过理性看待信之教义时它又是何性质：当通过神性真理，即圣言看待信之教义时，每一个事物，无论理性的还是记忆的，都会确认它；但当通过人的事物看待它时，情况就不是这样了，这时，没有任何良善与真理成孕；因为通过圣言看待事物就是通过主来看待，而通过理性和记忆知识看待事物就是通过人来看待。前者生出一切聪明智慧，后者生出一切疯狂愚蠢。</p>

And they brought forth. That this signifies fruitfulness, is evident from the signification of "bringing forth" and of "birth." In the internal sense of the Word none but spiritual and celestial things 
are signified; on which account where mention is made of "conception" or of "conceiving;" of "bearing" or of "bringing forth;" of "birth" or of "being born;" of "generation" or of "generating," as 
well as of those who beget, as "father and mother;" and of those who are begotten, as "sons and daughters," all these are meant in none but a spiritual sense, for in itself the Word is spiritual and celestial; 
and such is the case here in regard to "bringing forth," by which is signified fruitfulness in respect to the things of doctrine. [2] That in the Word "birth" means no other kind of birth than 
this, is evident from the passages that follow. In Samuel: </p>
<p>     The full have hired out themselves for bread, and the hungry have ceased, until the barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many 
children hath languished; Jehovah killeth and maketh alive. He causeth to go down into hell, and bringeth up (1 Sam. 2:5-6). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     She that hath borne seven languisheth, she breatheth out 
her soul; her sun is gone down while it is yet day (Jer. 15:9). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Sing, O barren, that did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, that did not travail with child; for more 
are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married wife, saith Jehovah (Isa. 54:1). In David: </p>
<p>     The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests; and in His temple 
everyone speaketh glory (Ps. 29:9). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Blush, O Zidon, for the sea hath spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I brought up 
young men, nor caused maids to grow up; as with the report of Egypt, they shall travail according to the report of Tyre (Isa. 23:4-5).      Before she travailed she brought forth, and before her pain 
came she was delivered of a man child. Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? Does the earth travail in one day, and shall I not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah; shall I cause to 
bring forth, and close up? said thy God (Isa. 66:7-9). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Ask I pray and see whether a man bringeth forth; wherefore have I seen every man with his hands on his loins, as one that bringeth 
forth (Jer. 30:6). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will set a fire in Egypt, and Sin travailing shall travail, and No may be...(Ezek. 30:16). In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, 
from the birth, and from the womb, and from conception (Hos. 9:11). In the same: </p>
<p>     The pains of one that travaileth came upon Ephraim; he is an unwise son, for at the time he will not stand in 
the place of the breaking forth of sons (Hos. 13:13). In John: </p>
<p>     A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; and she being with child cried, 
travailing, and pained to bring forth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she brought forth her son, he might devour him. And she brought forth a man child, 
who was to pasture all nations with a rod of iron; but the child was caught up unto God and to His throne (Rev. 12:1-5). [3] Who cannot see from all these passages that no other conceptions and births 
are signified than those which are of the church? And the same is the case with what is here said concerning Abimelech, that "God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants, and they brought 
forth;" and that "Jehovah closing had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of the word of Sarah, Abraham's wife." What is signified by these things in the internal sense is evident 
from the explication of the same, namely, the quality of the doctrine of faith when regarded from Divine truths, and when regarded from the rational: when it is regarded from Divine truths, that 
is, from the Word, then each and all things, of both reason and memory, confirm it; but this is not the case when it is regarded from human things, that is, from reason and memory-knowledges; for then 
nothing of good and nothing of truth is conceived; for to regard it from the Word is to regard it from the Lord, whereas to regard it from reason and memory-knowledge is to regard it from man. From the 
former comes all intelligence and wisdom; from the latter all insanity and folly. </p>

'And they gave birth' means fertileness This is clear from the meaning of 'bearing' and 'childbirth'. In the internal sense of the Word none but spiritual and celestial things are meant, and therefore 
where the expressions conception or conceiving, childbirth or giving birth, birth or being born, generation or generating, are used, and when those who beget as father and mother, and those who are 
begotten as sons and daughters, are spoken of, such are not meant in any but a spiritual sense, for in itself the Word is spiritual and celestial. The same applies here also to 'giving birth', which means 
fertileness as regards matters of doctrine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that no other kinds of childbirths are meant in the Word by childbirths may become clear from the following places: In Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
Those 
who were full have hired themselves out for bread, and those who were hungry have ceased to be so, until the barren has borne seven, and she who has many has left off. Jehovah takes life and He gives 
life; He causes [some] to go down into hell and [others] to come up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%202:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 2: 5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The bearer of seven languishes, she breathes her last. Her sun is going down while it is still 
day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2015:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 15: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Sing, O barren one, who did not bear, break forth into singing and shout, who has not gone into labour; for the sons of her that is desolate are more than the sons of 
her that is married, said Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of Jehovah causes the hinds to calve, and He strips the forests bare; and in His temple everyone says, Glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2029:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 29: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Blush, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not gone into labour, I have not given birth, nor have I reared young men or brought up young women. As when 
the report comes to Egypt, they go into labour over the report of Tyre. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23: 4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Before she went into labour she gave birth, and before pain came to her she brought 
forth a male child. Who has heard of such a thing as this? Who has seen such? Does a land give birth in one day? And shall I [bring to the point of birth and not] cause to give birth? said Jehovah. Shall 
I who cause to give birth shut up [the womb]? said your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:%207-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66: 7-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Ask, now, and see whether a male can bear. Why then have I seen every man, hands on loins, like one giving 
birth? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2030:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 30: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will send fire on Egypt, and Sin will certainly go into labour, and No will be [breached]. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2030:%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 30: 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
As for Ephraim, their glory will fly 
away like a bird, away from birth, and from the womb, and from conception. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The pains of childbirth have come upon Ephraim, he is an unwise son, for now he will 
not present himself at the mouth of the womb of sons. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Carrying in the 
womb she cried out in labour, and was in anguish to give birth. A dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she had given birth to her child he might devour it. She gave 
birth therefore to a male child, who was to rule<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> all nations with an iron rod. But the boy was caught up to God and His throne. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:%201,%202,%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12: 1, 2, 4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all these places anyone may see that 
no other conceptions and births are meant than those which are conceptions and births of the Church. The same may also be seen from the things said about Abimelech, that 'God healed Abimelech, his wife, 
and his women servants, and they gave birth'; and that 'Jehovah had completely closed every womb in Abimelech's house on account of the matter of Sarah, Abraham's wife'. What is meant in the internal 
sense by these words may become clear from the explanation of them, namely the character of the doctrine of faith when regarded from Divine truths, and the character of it when regarded from the rational. 
That is to say, when regarded from Divine truths, that is, from the Word, every single thing, both rational and factual, is confirmatory. But it is different when it is regarded from human things, 
that is from reason and knowledge. When regarded from the latter no good or truth at all is conceived; for to regard things from the Word is to do so from the Lord, but to regard them from reason 
and knowledge is to do so from man. The former gives rise to all intelligence and wisdom, the latter to all insanity and stupidity.

`Et pepererunt': quod significet fertilitatem, constat a significatione `parere et partus'; in sensu interno Verbi non sunt nisi quam spiritualia et caelestia quae significantur, quare ubi nominatur 
conceptio seu concipere, partus seu parere, nativitas seu nasci, generatio seu generare, (m)tum qui gignunt ut pater et mater, et qui gignuntur ut filii et filiae,(n) non nisi quam in spirituali sensu 
intelliguntur, nam Verbum in se est spirituale et caeleste; ita hic quoque `parere,' quo significatur fertilitas quoad illa quae sunt doctrinae.  [2] Quod per `partus' in Verbo non alii partus intelligantur, 
constare potest ab his locis: apud Samuelem, 	Saturi pane conducti sunt, et famelici cessarunt, usque dum sterilis peperit septem, multiprolis defecit; Jehovah occidit et vivificat, descendere 
facit in infernum, et ascendere facit, 1 Sam. 11 5, 6: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Languet pariens septem, exspirat animam suam; occidit sol ejus, dum adhuc dies, xv 9: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Canta sterilis, non peperit, 
persona cantu et jubila, non parturivit, quia multi filii desolatae, prae filiis maritatae, dixit Jehovah, liv 1: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Vox Jehovae parturire facit cervas, et denudat silvas; et in 
templo Ipsius omnis Ipsius dicit gloriam, Ps. xxix 9: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Erubesce Zidon, quia dixit mare, munimentum maris dicendo, Non parturivi, non peperi, nec educavi juvenes, et adolescere feci puellas, 
sicut cum fama Aegypto, parturient, secundum famam Tyri, xxiii 4, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Antequam parturit, parit; et antequam venit dolor ei, enixa est masculum.  Quis audivit sicut hoc? quis vidit 
sicut illa? num parturit terra die uno,... et num [Ego frangam et non] parere faciam? dixit Jehovah.  An Ego parere faciens, et occludam? dixit Deus tuus, lxvi 7-9: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Interrogate quaeso, 
et videte, si pariens mas; quare vidi omnem virum manus ejus super lumbis suis, sicut parientis? xxx 6: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Dabo ignem in Aegypto, et parturiendo parturiet Sin, et No erit {1} [ad perrumpendum] 
xxx 16: </p>
<p>apud Hosheam, 	Ephraim, sicut avis avolabit gloria eorum, a partu, et ab utero et a conceptione, ix 11: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Dolores parturientis venerunt Ephraimo, is filius non sapiens, 
quia tempore non stabit in fractura matricis filiorum, xiii 13: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Mulier circumdata sole, et luna sub pedibus ejus, et super capite ejus corona stellarum duodecim; in utero gerens, 
clamavit parturiens, et cruciata ad pariendum:... Draco stetit coram muliere, quae paritura erat, ut quando peperisset filium suum devoraret; peperit itaque filium masculum, qui pasturus erat omnes 
gentes virga ferrea; sed raptus est puer quoad Deum, et thronum Ipsius, Apoc. xii 1, 	2, 4, 5. [3] Ex his omnibus locis quisque videre potest quod non alii conceptus et partus significentur quam qui 
sunt Ecclesiae; similiter ex his quae de Abimelecho dicuntur quod `sanaret Deus Abimelechum, uxorem ejus, et ancillas ejus, et pepererunt'; et quod `claudendo clauserit Jehovah omnem uterum domus Abimelechi, 
propter verbum Sarae, uxoris Abrahami.'  Quid in sensu interno per haec significatur, constare potest ab explicatione eorum, nempe quod status doctrinae fidei, qualis est dum spectatur a veris 
Divinis, et qualis est dum spectatur a rationali; quod nempe, cum a veris Divinis, hoc est, a Verbo, tunc omnia et singula tam rationalia quam scientifica confirment; aliter cum ab humanis, hoc est, 
a ratione et scientia, quod tunc nihil boni et nihil veri concipiatur; nam spectare a Verbo est a Domino, at spectare a ratione et scientia est ab homine, ex illo est omnis intelligentia et sapientia, 
ex his est omnis insania et stultitia. 	@1 sit AI.$ 	@2 Gk. i [ ] AR 545 has fetus ejus.$ </p>
