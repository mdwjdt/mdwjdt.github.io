Verses 8, 9. And it came to pass, because the days were there prolonged to him, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold Isaac was laughing with Rebekah 
his woman. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Surely behold she is thy woman, and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. "And it came to pass, 
because the days were there prolonged to him," signifies a state of reception; "that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw," signifies the doctrine of faith looking 
to rational things in knowledges; "and behold Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his woman," signifies that Divine good was present in Divine truth; "and Abimelech called Isaac, and said," signifies the 
Lord's perception from doctrine; "Surely behold she is thy woman, and how saidst thou, She is my sister?" signifies if Divine truth, it was not also rational; "and Isaac said unto him, Because I said, 
Lest I die for her," signifies that it would not be received. </p>

Verses 8, 9 And it happened, because his days were prolonged for him there, that Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through a window and saw, and behold, Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his 
wife. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, But behold, she is your wife! So how did you come to say, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Perhaps I may die because of her. </p>
<p>'It 
happened, because his days were prolonged for him there' means a state of reception. 'That Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through a window and saw' means the doctrine of faith which has 
regard to rational concepts held within cognitions. 'And behold, Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his wife' means that Divine Good was present within Divine Truth. 'And Abimelech called Isaac, and said' 
means the Lord's perception from doctrine. 'But behold, she is your wife! So how did you come to say, She is my sister?' means, if it was Divine Truth, then it was not also rational truth. 'And Isaac 
said to him, Because I said, Perhaps I may die because of her' means that it would not be received. </p>

</p><b>3389.</b>
Vers. 8, 9.  Et factum, quia prolongabantur ei ibi dies, et prospexit Abimelech rex Philistaeorum trans fenestram, et vidit, et ecce Jishak ridens cum Rebecca muliere sua. Et vocabat Abimelech Jishakum, 
et dixit, Atqui ecce mulier tua illa, et quomodo dixisti, Soror mea illa? et dixit ad illum Jishak, Quia dixi, Forte moriar propter illam. `Factum quia prolongabantur ei ibi dies' significat statum 
receptionis: `et prospexit Abimelech rex Philistaeorum trans fenestram, et vidit' significat doctrinam fidei spectantem rationalia in cognitionibus: `et ecce Jishak ridens cum Rebecca muliere sua' 
significat quod Divinum Bonum adesset in Divino Vero: `et vocabat Abimelech Jishakum et dixit' significat Domini perceptionem ex doctrina: `Atqui ecce mulier tua illa, et quomodo dixisti, Soror mea illa?' 
significat si Divinum Verum, non quoque rationale esset: `et dixit ad illum Jishak, Quia dixi, Forte moriar propter illam' significat quod non reciperetur. </p>
