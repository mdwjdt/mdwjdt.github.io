<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5067节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5067.</strong>由于主并不在乎外在事物，只在乎内在事物，还由于人不单单通过敬拜，还通过仁爱及其行为来见证他的内在事物，所以主回答说：我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。那些处于仁爱与生活的良善之人就被称为“弟兄”；事实上，主与他们同在，因为他们处于良善本身；严格来说，他们才是邻舍所指的人。然而，主甚至在这些人里面也不显明自己，因为与祂相比，他们是毫无价值的。但人通过从内在敬拜祂而在主面前显明自己。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5067</b></p><p><b>5067.</b>
As therefore the Lord cares not for external but for internal things, and as man testifies to his internal things, not by worship only, but by charity and its acts, the Lord answered: </p>
<p>	Verily I say 
to you, Insofar as ye did it to one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it to Me;  those are called "brethren" who are in the good of charity and of life; for the Lord is with them, because they 
are in good itself; and it is they who are properly meant by the neighbor. In these also the Lord does not manifest Himself, for in respect to Him they are vile; but the man manifests himself before 
the Lord, in that he worships Him from within. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5067</b></p><p><b>5067.</b>
Since therefore the Lord is not concerned about external things, only about those that are internal, and a person bears witness to internal ones not through worship alone but through charity and acts 
that express it, the Lord replied, </p>
<p>Truly I say to you, Insofar as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers you did it to Me. </p>
<p>The word 'brothers' is used to describe those in whom the 
good of charity and life is present; for since good itself is present in them, the Lord resides with them. These are the ones who are meant, strictly speaking, by the neighbour. Yet the Lord does not 
present Himself even within these, for compared with Him they are worthless. But a person presents himself before the Lord by worshipping Him with his inner being. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5067</b>
</p><b>5067.</b>
Quia itaque Dominus externa non curat sed interna, et interna testificatur homo non per solum cultum, sed per charitatem et ejus exercitia, idcirco Dominus respondit, `Amen dico vobis, quantum fecistis 
uni horum fratrum Meorum minimorum, Mihi fecistis'. Qui fratres nominantur, sunt illi qui in bono charitatis et vitae sunt, nam Dominus apud illos est quia in ipso bono; et sunt qui proprie 
intelliguntur per proximum; in his quoque Dominus se non manifestat, nam viles sunt respective, sed homo se manifestat coram Domino quod ex interiore Ipsum colat. </p>
