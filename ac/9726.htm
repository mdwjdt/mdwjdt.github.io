<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9726节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9726.</strong>“要为坛作一个格栅，一个网”表感官层，也就是最末和最低层。这从“一个格栅，一个网”的含义清楚可知。“一个格栅，一个网”是指外在感官层，因而是指为一个人形成生命的最末和最低层之物；由于这最低层由格栅来表示，所以格栅被置于祭坛周围。这感官层之所以由“格栅”来代表，是因为可以说，它首先筛选并整理进入人的心智并呈现给理解力和意愿的事物，即真理和良善。如果这感官层由良善构成，那么除了良善和源于良善的真理之外，它不会允许任何东西通过，并弃绝邪恶和由邪恶所产生的虚假。因为感官层是对最外层中属理解力和意愿的事物的觉知和感受本身，这种觉知和感受的实际能力照着对这些事物的情感而被完美塑成。这一切的性质可通过身体中的许多事物来说明。身体的最外层处处都有网状形式，可以说有筛子或格栅；它们筛选从世界流向它们的事物，凡适合的，就允许通过，因为它们是可喜悦的；凡不适合的，就弃绝，因为它们是可厌恶的。胃里就有这类极其敏感的系统；这些系统会让乳糜中适合的汁液进入血液，因为这些汁液是有用的，因而是可喜悦的；并弃绝不适合的，因为它们是有害的，因而是可厌恶的。感官层，就是人生命的最末和最低层也是这种情况。但对人来说，这个层面已经完全被破坏掉了，因为它离世界最近，并暴露给世界，因此是最后重生的层面；事实上，如今几<br />乎没有人能被重生至这一层面。至于对这些人来说，感官层是什么性质，可参看前面关于它的说明（参看<a href="4009.htm">4009</a>，<a href="5077.htm">5077</a>，<a href="5081.htm">5081</a>，<a href="5084.htm">5084</a>，<a href="5094.htm">5094</a>，<a href="5125.htm">5125</a>，<a href="5128.htm">5128</a>，<a href="5580.htm">5580</a>，<a href="5767.htm">5767</a>，<a href="5774.htm">5774</a>，<a href="6183.htm">6183</a>，<a href="6201.htm">6201</a>，<a href="6310.htm">6310</a>-<a href="6318.htm">6318</a>，<a href="6564.htm">6564</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>，<a href="6612.htm">6612</a>，<a href="6614.htm">6614</a>，<a href="6622.htm">6622</a>，<a href="6624.htm">6624</a>，<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>，<a href="6845.htm">6845</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="6949.htm">6949</a>，<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>，<a href="7645.htm">7645</a>，<a href="7693.htm">7693</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>节）。因此，人若要看见并理解信之真理和爱之良善，就必须被主从感官层提升至更内在的层面。不过，坛周围的“一个格栅，一个网”所表示的感官层是主的神性人身的感官层，因为祭坛是主和源于爱之良善的对主之敬拜的代表（<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt make for it a grating, a network. That this signifies the sensuous, which is the ultimate, is evident from the signification of "a grating, a network," as being the external sensuous, 
thus that which is the ultimate of life with man; and because it signifies the ultimate, it was put round about the altar. This sensuous was represented by "the grating" because in the first place it 
as it were sifts and separates the things which enter to man and are presented to the understanding and the will, thus truths and goods. If the sensuous is from good, it admits nothing but goods and truths 
which are from good, and rejects evils and the falsities which are from evil; for the sensuous is the perceptive and sensitive itself of the things of the understanding and of the will in the extremes, 
being formed precisely according to their affections. The nature of it may be illustrated by very many things in the body; for everywhere in the extremes of the body there are net-like forms, 
and as it were sieves or gratings, which sift the things that flow in from the world, admitting, from desire, those which are suitable, and rejecting, from aversion, those which are not suitable. There 
are such most exquisite forms in the stomach, which in accordance with the desires, and for the sake of use, admit into the blood what is suitable of the chyle, and reject what is unsuitable, in accordance 
with the aversion that is felt for things injurious. The case is similar with the sensuous, which is the ultimate of man's life. But with man this has been completely destroyed, for the reason 
that it stands out nearest to the world, and therefore is the last to be regenerated, and at this day scarcely anyone can be regenerated as far as this; and what in consequence is the nature of this 
sensuous with such persons can be seen from what has been already shown about it (see n. 4009, 5077, 5081, 5084, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 5774, 6183, 6201, 6310-6318, 6564, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 
6624, 6844, 6845, 6948, 6949, 7442, 7645, 7693, 9212, 9216). Therefore man is raised by the Lord from this sensuous toward more inward things, in order that he may see and take hold of the truths which 
are of faith, and the goods which are of love. But the sensuous which is signified by "the grating, a network round about the altar," is the sensuous of the Lord's Divine Human; for the altar is the 
representative of the Lord, and of the worship of Him from the good of love (n. 9714). </p>

'And you shall make for it a grating, a network' means the level of sensory perception, which is the last and lowest. This is clear from the meaning of 'a grating, a network' as external sensory perception, 
thus that which forms for a person the last and lowest level of life; and since this lowest level is meant by the grating it was placed all the way round the altar. Such sensory perception was 
represented by the grating because it first sifts so to speak and sorts out those things which enter the human mind and present themselves to the understanding and will, namely truths and forms of good. 
If the sensory perception is composed of good it does not let anything through other than forms of good, and truths derived from good, and rejects evils and the falsities arising from evil. For sensory 
perception is the actual ability to perceive things which belong to the understanding and to sense those which belong to the will as they exist on outermost levels, an ability that is perfectly 
fashioned for the affections for those things. The nature of all this may be illustrated by very many things in the body. Everywhere in the outermost parts within the body there are forms that resemble 
nets and there are so to speak gratings which sort out the things that flow towards them from the world. Those that are suitable are let through because they are desirable, and those that are unsuitable 
are rejected because they are loathsome. Extremely sensitive systems such as these exist in the stomach. These let through into the blood the suitable juices of the chyle, because these juices are 
useful and therefore desirable, and reject the unsuitable because they are harmful and therefore loathsome. The situation is similar with sensory perception, which is the last and lowest level of a 
person's life. But this level with a person has become totally wrecked, the reason why being that it stands right next to and is exposed to the world and is therefore the last to be regenerated, indeed 
scarcely anyone at the present day is able to be regenerated down to that level. As regards what the level of sensory perception is like with these people, see what has been shown already concerning 
it in <a href="4009.htm">4009</a>, <a href="5077.htm">5077</a>, <a href="5081.htm">5081</a>, <a href="5084.htm">5084</a>, <a href="5094.htm">5094</a>, <a href="5125.htm">5125</a>, <a href="5128.htm">5128</a>, <a href="5580.htm">5580</a>, <a href="5767.htm">5767</a>, <a href="5774.htm">5774</a>, <a href="6183.htm">6183</a>, <a href="6201.htm">6201</a>, <a href="6310.htm">6310</a>-<a href="6318.htm">6318</a>, <a href="6564.htm">6564</a>, <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>, <a href="6612.htm">6612</a>, <a href="6614.htm">6614</a>, <a href="6622.htm">6622</a>, <a href="6624.htm">6624</a>, <a href="6844.htm">6844</a>, <a href="6845.htm">6845</a>, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="6949.htm">6949</a>, <a href="7442.htm">7442</a>, <a href="7645.htm">7645</a>, <a href="7693.htm">7693</a>, <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="9216.htm">9216</a>.  Therefore if a person 
is to see and have an understanding of the truths of faith and the forms of the good of love he must be raised by the Lord above that level to more internal levels. But the sensory perception meant 
by 'the grating, the network' around the altar is the sensory perception belonging to the Lord's Divine Human, since the altar is representative of the Lord and of the worship of Him that springs from 
the good of love, <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>.  </p>

`Et facies ei cribrum, opus retis': quod significet sensuale, quod ultimum, constat ex significatione `cribri operis retis' quod sit sensuale externum, ita quod ultimum vitae est apud hominem; et quia 
ultimum {1} ideo etiam circumcirca {2} altare positum erat {3}; sensuale illud repraesentatum est per `cribrum,' quoniam id quasi cribrat et cernit primum illa quae intrant apud hominem, et sistuntur 
intellectui et voluntati, ita vera et bona; si sensuale ex bono est,tunc non admittit nisi bona, et vera quae ex bono, et tunc rejicit mala et falsa quae ex malo; sensuale enim {4} est ipsum perceptivum 
et sensitivum intellectualium {5} et (x)voluntariorum in extremis, prorsus ad illorum affectiones formatum.  Quale id est, illustrari potest a permultis in corpore; ubivis in extremis corporis sunt 
reticulares formae et quasi cribra, quae alluentia e mundo cernunt convenientia admittendo {6} ex desiderio, et {7} disconvenientia rejiciendo {8} ex aversatione; tales formae exquisitissimae in ventriculo 
sunt, quae secundum desideria propter utilitates convenientia chyli in sanguinem admittunt, et secundum aversationem {9} propter damna, disconvenientia rejiciunt; cum sensuali, quod ultimum 
vitae hominis est, similiter se habet, sed hoc apud hominem {10} prorsus (t)deperditum est, ex causa quia id (o)proxime mundo exstat, et ideo ultimum est quod regeneratur, et usque ad illud vix aliquis 
hodie regenerari potest; quale itaque apud hos sensuale illud est, videantur quae de illo prius n. 4009, 5077, 5081, 5084, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 5774, 6183, 6201, 6310-6318, 6564, 6598, 6612,
