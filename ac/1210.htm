<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1210.</strong>“迦萨”表已揭示的有关仁的事物。这首先从以下事实清楚可知，即在圣言中，当论述属灵事物时，也会论述与其同在的属天事物，也就是说，论述信的事物时，也会论述仁的事物；其次，从圣言中提及“迦萨”的地方清楚可知；再次，从以下事实清楚可知，即认知能延伸到信，甚至延伸到仁，也就是它们的极限。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1210.</strong> The symbolism of Gaza as information revealed about charity is established by two things. One is that where the Word speaks of spiritual traits it also speaks of heavenly traits in connection with them. In other words, when it talks about matters of faith it also talks about matters of charity. The other is from the Word as well, in places that mention Gaza.{*1} What is more, knowledge extends to include faith, reaching as far as charity, which is its most distant boundary.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg does not expand on this statement about the biblical symbolism of Gaza anywhere else in his works. Some of the Bible verses that mention Gaza are <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1210/bible_king-james-version_judges_16_1" target=_top>Judges 16:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1210/bible_king-james-version_judges_16_21" target=_top>21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1210/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_6" target=_top>Amos 1:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1210/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_7" target=_top>7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1210/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_9_5" target=_top>Zechariah 9:5</a>.

That by "Gaza" are signified the things that have been revealed concerning charity, is evident from the fact that where spiritual things are treated of in the Word, celestial things also are treated 
of, conjointly (that is to say, when things of faith are treated of, so also are those of charity); and the same is also evident from the Word where "Gaza" is mentioned; and still further from the consideration 
that knowledges extend to faith, and even to charity, which is their furthest limit. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1210</b></p><p><b>1210.</b>
That 'Gaza' means things that have been revealed concerning charity becomes clear first of all from the fact that in the Word when spiritual things are dealt with, so also are celestial along with them, 
that is, when matters of faith are dealt with, so also are those of charity; and secondly from the Word where Gaza is mentioned. It becomes clear in addition from the fact that cognitions extend to 
faith and right on to charity, which is their furthest limit. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1210</b>
</p><b>1210.</b>
Quod per 'Azzam' significentur illa quae revelata sunt de charitate, constare potest tam ex eo quod in Verbo ubi de spiritualibus, etiam de caelestibus conjunctum agatur, hoc est, quando de illis quae 
sunt fidei, etiam de illis quae sunt charitatis; quam quoque ex Verbo ubi Azza nominatur:  praeterea quod cognitiones se extendant ad fidem usque ad charitatem, quae est ultimus earum terminus. </p>
