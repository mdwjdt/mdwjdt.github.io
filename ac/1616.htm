<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1616节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1616.</strong>“亚伯兰就挪移帐棚，来到希伯仑幔利的橡树那里居住”表主抵达一种更为内在的直觉。这从“挪移帐棚”，即挪动并再次搭建帐棚和“橡树”的含义清楚可知：“挪移帐棚”是指联结的过程；因为“帐棚”是指敬拜的圣洁，如前所述（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1452.htm">1452</a>节），外在人藉此与内在人结合；“橡树”是指直觉，如前所述（<a href="1442.htm">1442</a>，<a href="1443.htm">1443</a>节），那里以单数形式提到的“摩利橡树”表最初的直觉，而此处以复数形式提到的“希伯仑幔利的橡树”表更充分，即更内在的直觉。这种直觉被称为“希伯仑幔利的橡树”。幔利在别处有所提及（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.13.htm">14:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.1.htm">18:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.17.htm">23:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.27.htm">35:27</a>等）；希伯仑在别处也有所提及（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.27.htm">35:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.14.htm">37:14</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.36.htm">10:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.39.htm">39</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书14.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.13.htm">15:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.54.htm">54</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书20.7.htm">20:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.11.htm">21:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.13.htm">13</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.10.htm">1:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.20.htm">20</a>等）。至于幔利和希伯仑的含义，蒙主怜悯，等到解读提及它们的圣言经文时就会看到。<br />关于“希伯仑幔利的橡树”表更内在的直觉，情况如下：属外在人的事物越是与属内在人的属天之物结合，直觉就越增长，并变得更内在。与属天之物的结合会赋予理解力，因为内在人的生命本身就居于属对耶和华之爱的属天之物里面；或也可说，耶和华就存在于属爱的属天之物里面，即存在于属天之爱中。在外在人里面，这种存在觉察不到，除非产生结合，一切直觉都来自结合。<br />由此处的内义清楚可知主的情形如何：即随着认知的增多，并结出硕果，主的外在人或人性本质逐步被联结于神性本质。若不凭借认知，人决无法作为一个人被联结于耶和华或主。因为人正是凭借认知而成为人。这也适用于主，因为主象其他人那样出生，也和其他人一样接受教导。然而，属天之物不断被融入其作为容器的认知中，结果，祂的认知不断变成接受属天之物的容器，这些容器本身也变得属天。<br />主以这种方式不断朝婴儿的属天之物发展，因为如前所述，属爱的属天之物自婴儿早期至童年，再到青春期就被注入在人里面。由于是一个人，故那时及以后，他被赋予知识和认知。若人能这样重生，那些知识和认知就会充满属爱与仁的属天之物，并相应地被植入在他自婴儿直到童年和青春期时被赋予的属天之物中，他的外在人就这样与他的内在人结合。它们首先被植入在青春期时被赋予的属天之物中，然后被植入在童年时被赋予的属天之物中，最后被植入在婴孩时被赋予的属天之物中。这时，他便成了一个“小孩子”，主说“在神国的，正是这样的人”。唯独主成就这种植入，因此，属天之物若非出自并属于主，就不会，也不可能存在于人身上。<br />然而，主凭自己的力量将祂的外在人与内在人融合起来，并用属天之物充满祂的认知，祂按照神序将它们植入在属天之物中。首先，主将它们植入在祂童年的属天之物中，然后植入在祂童年到婴儿时的属天之物中，最后植入在祂婴儿时的属天之物中。与此同时，祂的人性本质变成纯真本身和爱本身，天上和地上的一切纯真和一切爱均源于此。这种纯真是真正的婴儿，因为它同时也是智慧。但婴儿的纯真若不凭认知变成智慧的纯真，则一点用处也没有；所以，在来世，婴儿都被赋予认知。由于主将认知植入在属天之物中，故祂拥有直觉，因为如前所述，一切直觉都来自结合。当植入到童年所获得的记忆知识中时，主便拥有了其最初的直觉，这种直觉就是“摩利橡树”所表示的；当植入认知时，祂便拥有其第二直觉，也就是此处所论述的主题，它更为内在，这种直觉是“希伯仑幔利的橡树”所表示的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1616.</strong> Abram pitched his tent, and he came and lived in the oak groves of Mamre, which is in Hebron, means that the Lord achieved a still deeper perceptive ability, as can be seen from the symbolism of pitching a tent (in the sense of setting a tent up in a series of locations) as uniting. A tent means the holiness of worship, as shown before in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414" target=_top>414</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1452" target=_top>1452</a>, and this is what unites the outer self to the inner. The meaning can also be seen from the symbolism of an oak grove as perception, as discussed above in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1442" target=_top>1442</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443" target=_top>1443</a>. Those sections dealt with the oak grove of Moreh, which is the dawn of perception. The present verse, though, speaks of the oak groves of Mamre, in the plural, and they symbolize increasing perception 钬?that is, deeper perception. This perception is referred to as the "oak groves of Mamre, which is in Hebron." Mamre is mentioned elsewhere too, as for example in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>Genesis 14:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_genesis_18_1" target=_top>18:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_genesis_23_17-18" target=_top>23:17-18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_genesis_23_19" target=_top>19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_genesis_35_27" target=_top>35:27</a>.

What they symbolize there will be seen in the relevant places, by the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} [2] To expand on the symbolism of the "oak groves of Mamre, which is in Hebron" as a still deeper ability to perceive: The more the attributes of the outer self unite with the heavenly qualities of the inner self, the more perception grows and deepens. Union with heavenly qualities yields perception. This is because the heavenly attributes of love for Jehovah contain the actual living energy of the inner self. To put the same thing another way, the heavenly attributes of love 钬?or in other words, heavenly love itself 钬?contain Jehovah's presence. His presence is not perceived in the outer self until union is achieved. All perception comes from union.<br />[3] The inner meaning here reveals how matters stood with the Lord: His outer self (his human nature) united with his divine nature more and more as the religious knowledge he possessed multiplied and reproduced itself. No individual, so far as he or she is human, can be united to Jehovah (that is, the Lord) except through religious knowledge, because it is this knowledge that makes a person human. This was true for the Lord too, because he was born like any other person and was taught the same way as any other person. Heavenly values, however, were constantly being infused into the religious concepts he had learned, which acted as receiving vessels. These concepts, then, were constantly being made into vessels for receiving heavenly qualities and were themselves made heavenly as well.<br />So the Lord made continuous progress toward the heavenly condition of early childhood.<br />[4] As I have said before, the heavenly aspects of love are instilled in us from infancy up until adolescence [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_430" target=_top>430</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_561" target=_top>561</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1438" target=_top>1438</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450" target=_top>1450-1451</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453" target=_top>1453:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1472" target=_top>1472</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1495" target=_top>1495-1496</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548" target=_top>1548</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1555#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1555:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1557" target=_top>1557</a>] 钬?even into early adulthood, depending on the kind of person we are. During that time and later, we are trained in knowledge both secular and religious. If we are the kind of people who can be reborn, heavenly dimensions 钬?aspects of love and charity 钬?fill out both kinds of knowledge. In this way the knowledge is grafted onto the heavenly gifts that we have received from infancy up till adolescence and early adulthood. In the process, our outward self unites with our inward self. First the knowledge is grafted onto the heavenly gifts we received as young adults, next onto those we received throughout adolescence, and finally onto those we received in early childhood. Then we become little children, of whom the Lord said, "To such belongs the kingdom of God" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_mark_10_14" target=_top>Mark 10:14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/bible_king-james-version_luke_18_16" target=_top>Luke 18:16</a>]. The Lord alone does the grafting, so nothing heavenly exists or can exist in us that does not come from the Lord and belong to the Lord.<br />[5] The Lord, however, did all this by his own power 钬?united his outer self to his inner, filled his knowledge with heavenly dimensions, and grafted this knowledge onto his heavenly gifts. Moreover, he did so according to the divine plan; first he grafted the knowledge onto the heavenly gifts received in adolescence, then onto those received at the age between childhood and adolescence, and finally onto those he received in his childhood. By these means he caused his human nature as well to become innocence itself and love itself, the source of all innocence and all love in the heavens and on earth.<br />This kind of innocence is true childhood, because it is also wisdom. A child's innocence is useless, though, unless religious knowledge turns it into the innocence of wisdom, so children in the other life are trained in such knowledge.<br />Because the Lord grafted this knowledge onto his heavenly gifts, he had perception, since all perception comes from union, as noted. Perception dawned in him when he grafted on the facts he had learned in youth, and this dawn of perception is symbolized by the oak grove of Moreh. It evolved (as described in the current verse) into a deeper kind when he grafted religious knowledge on, and this kind of perception is symbolized by the oak groves of Mamre, which is in Hebron.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the meaning of Mamre, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1704" target=_top>1704-1705</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2144" target=_top>2144-2145</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2970" target=_top>2970</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1616/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6551" target=_top>6551[1]</a>.

And Abram pitched his tent, and came and dwelt in the oak-groves of Mamre that are in Hebron. That this signifies that the Lord attained to a perception still more internal, is evident from the signification 
of "pitching a tent," that is, of moving and fixing a tent, as being to be conjoined,-for a "tent" is the holy of worship (as shown before, n. 414, 1452), by which the external man is conjoined 
with the internal-and from the signification of an "oak-grove," as being perception, as explained above (n. 1442, 1443), where it was "the oak-grove of Moreh," which is the first perception; but here, 
"the oak-groves of Mamre," in the plural, which signify more perception, that is, perception more internal. This perception is called "the oak-groves of Mamre that are in Hebron." "Mamre" is also 
mentioned elsewhere (as in Gen. 14:13; 18:1; 23:17-19; 35:27), and Hebron likewise (as in Gen. 35:27; 37:14; Josh. 10:36, 39; 14:13-15; 15:13, 54; 20:7; 21:11, 13; Judges 1:10, 20; and in other places); 
but with what signification, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be seen where these passages are explained.  [2] As to "the oak-groves of Mamre that are in Hebron" signifying a still more internal perception, 
the case is as follows. As the things that are of the external man are conjoined with the celestial things of the internal man, so perception increases and becomes more internal. Conjunction 
with celestial things gives perception; for in the celestial things that are of love to Jehovah is the very life of the internal man; or what is the same, in the celestial things that are of love, that 
is, in celestial love, Jehovah is present, which presence is not perceived in the external man until conjunction has been effected, all perception being from conjunction.  [3] From the internal sense 
it is here evident how the case was with the Lord, namely, that His external man, or the Human Essence, was conjoined with the Divine Essence by degrees, according to the multiplication and fructification 
of knowledges. In no way can anyone, as a man, be conjoined with Jehovah or the Lord, except by means of knowledges, for by means of knowledges a man becomes a man; and so the Lord, because born 
as are other men, was also instructed as they are, but into His knowledges as receptacles celestial things were constantly being insinuated, so that the knowledges continually became the recipient 
vessels of celestial things, and themselves also became celestial.  [4] He continually advanced in this way to the celestial things of infancy for, as before said, the celestial things that are of love 
are insinuated from the earliest infancy up to childhood, and also to youth, when being a man he is then and afterwards imbued with knowledges [scientiae et cognitiones]. If the man is such that he 
can be regenerated, these knowledges are then filled with the celestial things that are of love and charity, and are thus implanted in the celestial things with which he has been gifted from infancy 
up to childhood and youth; and thus his external man is conjoined with his internal man.  They are first implanted in the celestial things with which he was gifted in youth, next in those with which 
he was gifted in childhood, and finally in those with which he was gifted in infancy; and then he is a "little child," of whom the Lord said that "of such is the kingdom of God." This implantation is 
effected by the Lord alone; and for this reason nothing celestial is possible with man, nor can be, that is not from the Lord, and that is not the Lord's.  [5] But the Lord from His own power conjoined 
His external man with His internal man, and filled His knowledges with celestial things, and implanted them in the celestial things, and this in fact according to Divine order; first in the celestial 
things of His childhood, next in the celestial things of the age between childhood and infancy; and finally in the celestial things of His infancy; and thus at the same time became, as to the Human 
Essence,, innocence itself and love itself, from which are all innocence and all love in the heavens and on earth. Such innocence is true infancy, because it is at the same time wisdom. But the innocence 
of infancy, unless by means of knowledges it becomes the innocence of wisdom, is of no use; and therefore in the other life infants are imbued with knowledges. As the Lord implanted knowledges in 
celestial things, so had He perception, for, as before said, all perception is from conjunction. He had His first perception when He implanted the memory-knowledges of childhood, which perception is 
signified by "the oak-grove of Moreh;" and His second, treated of here, which is more internal, when He implanted knowledges, which perception is signified by "the oak-groves of Mamre that are in Hebron." </p>

That 'Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt in the oak groves of Mamre which are in Hebron' means that the Lord arrived at a perception more interior still is clear from the meaning of 'moving one's 
tent', that is, moving it and pitching it once again, as the process of being joined together; for 'a tent' is the holiness of worship, as shown already in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1452.htm">1452</a>, by which the external man is joined 
to the internal. It is also clear from the meaning of 'an oak-grove' as perception, dealt with already in <a href="1442.htm">1442</a>, <a href="1443.htm">1443</a>, where the phrase that occurred was 'the oak-grove of Moreh', meaning a first 
perception, whereas here the plural 'the oak-groves of Mamre' is used, which means a fuller, that is, more interior perception. This perception is called 'the oak-groves of Mamre which are in Hebron'. 
Mamre is also mentioned elsewhere in the Word, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2014:13;%2018:1;%2023:17-19;%2035:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 14:13; 18:1; 23:17-19; 35:27</a>; and Hebron too, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:27;%2037:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:27; 37:14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2010:36,%2039;%2014:13-15;%2015:13,%2054;%2020:7;%2021:11,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 10:36, 39; 14:13-15; 15:13, 54; 20:7; 21:11, 13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%201:10,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 1:10, 20</a>; and 
elsewhere. But what Mamre and Hebron mean where they are so mentioned will in the Lord's Divine mercy be seen when these other parts of the Word are explained. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of 'the oak-groves 
of Mamre which are in Hebron' meaning perception more interior still are as follows: To the extent that those things belonging to the external man are joined to celestial things belonging to the 
internal man perception grows and becomes more interior. Conjunction with celestial things confers perception, for within the celestial things that belong to love to Jehovah dwells the life itself of 
the internal man' or what amounts to the same, within celestial things which belong to love, that is, within celestial love, )Jehovah is present. This presence is not perceived in the external man however 
until the conjunction has taken place. All perception is the result of conjunction. </p>

 From the internal sense here it is clear what the situation was in the Lord's case: His External Man, 
or Human Essence, was joined step by step to the Divine Essence as cognitions multiplied and became fruitful. No one can ever, insofar as he is human, be joined to Jehovah, or the Lord, except by means 
of cognitions, for it is by means of cognitions that a person is made human. This applied to the Lord too since He was born as any other is born, and received instruction as any other does. Yet in the 
cognitions He had as receptacles celestial things were being instilled continually, with the result that His cognitions were constantly being made into the recipient vessels of celestial things; and 
these vessels also were themselves made celestial. </p>

<p><b>[4]</b>
 Constantly the Lord advanced in this manner towards the celestial things of infancy, for, as stated already, the celestial things which belong 
to love are being instilled in a person from earliest infancy to childhood and on into adolescence as well. Since he is a human being, at that time and later on he is endowed with knowledge and cognitions. 
If a person is such that he can be regenerated, that knowledge and those cognitions are filled with celestial things that belong to love and charity, and are accordingly implanted within the 
celestial things he was endowed with from infancy through to childhood and adolescence, and in this way his external man is joined to his internal. First of all they are implanted in the celestial things 
he was endowed with in adolescence, then in those he was endowed with in childhood, and finally in those he was endowed with in infancy. At that point he is 'the little child' regarding whom the Lord 
said 'of such is the kingdom of God'. This implanting is done by the Lord alone, and therefore nothing celestial with man either does or can exist with man that does not come from, and belong to, 
the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The Lord however from His own power joined His External Man to His Internal Man and filled His cognitions with celestial things, and He implanted them in celestial things, doing so according 
to Divine Order. First of all He implanted them in the celestial things of childhood, then in the celestial things of the age of childhood and back to infancy, and finally in the celestial things 
of His infancy. In this way He at the same time became as regards the Human Essence Innocence itself and Love itself, from which derive all innocence and all love in heaven and on earth. Such Innocence 
is true Infancy because it is simultaneously Wisdom. But the innocence of infancy is of no use at all unless by means of cognitions it becomes the innocence of wisdom, and this is why little children 
in the next life are endowed with cognitions. As the Lord implanted cognitions in celestial things, so He had perception, for, as stated, all perception is the result of conjunction. He had His 
first perception when He implanted the facts acquired in childhood, a perception meant by 'the oak-grove of Moreh'; and He had His second, which is the subject here, and which is more interior, when He 
implanted cognitions, a perception meant by 'the oak-groves of Mamre which are in Hebron'. </p>

Quod 'tentoriavit Abram, et venit et habitavit in quercetis Mamre, quae in Hebron' significet quod Dominus pervenit ad perceptionem adhuc interiorem, constat a significatione 'tentoriare,' seu tentorium 
movere et figere, quod sit conjungi: 'tentorium' enim es sanctum cultus, quod ostensum prius n. 414, 1452, quo conjungitur externus homo interno; exque significatione 'querceti' quod sit perceptio, 
de qua prius n. 1442, 1443, ubi 'quercetum Moreh,' quod est prima perceptio, hic autem 'querceta Mamre' in plurali, quae significant perceptionem plurem, hoc est, interiorem; haec perceptio appellatur 
'querceta Mamre quae in Hebron'; Mamre memoratur etiam alibi, ut Gen. xiv 13; xviii 1; xxiii 17-19; (x)xxxv 27.  Tum quoque Hebron, Gen. xxxv 27; xxxvii 14; Jos. x 36, 39; xiv 13-15; xv 13, 54: xx 
7; xxi 11, 13; Jud. i 10, 20, et alibi; sed qua significatione, ibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, videbitur.  [2] Quod 'querceta Mamre quae in Hebron' significent perceptionem adhuc interiorem, ita 
se habet: quemadmodum illa quae sunt externi hominis conjunguntur caelestibus interni hominis, ita perceptio crescit et fit interior; conjunctio cum caelestibus dat perceptionem; nam in caelestibus quae 
sunt amoris in Jehovam, est ipsa vita interni hominis, seu quod idem, in caelestibus quae sunt amoris, hoc est, in amore caelesti est Jehovah praesens, quae praesentia non percipitur in externo homine 
priusquam conjunctio facta; ex conjunctione est omnis perceptio.  [3] Ex sensu interno hic constat quomodo cum Domino se habuit, quod nempe Externus Ipsius Homo seu Essentia Humana per gradus secundum 
multiplicationem et fructificationem cognitionum conjuncta fuerit Essentiae Divinae; nusquam aliquis quatenus homo, conjungi potest Jehovae seu Domino nisi per cognitiones, nam per cognitiones homo 
fit homo; ita Dominus quia natus sicut alius homo, et instructus sicut alius homo, sed cognitionibus Ipsius ut receptaculis jugiter insinuabantur caelestia sic ut cognitiones factae continue vasa 
recipientia caelestium, ac haec ipsa quoque caelestia; [4] continue sic ad caelestia infantiae perrexit; nam, ut prius dictum, caelestia quae sunt amoris, insinuantur a prima infantia usque ad pueritiam, 
etiam ad adolescentiam; sicut homo est, tunc et postea imbuitur scientiis et cognitionibus; si homo talis est ut regenerari possit, scientiae illae et cognitiones implentur caelestibus quae sunt amoris 
et charitatis, et sic implantantur caelestibus quibus ab infantia ad pueritiam et adolescentiam donatus est, ac ita conjungitur externus ejus homo interno:  primum implantantur caelestibus quibus 
donatus in adolescentia, dein quibus in pueritia, demum quibus in infantia, tunc est 'infans,' de quo Dominus, quod 'talium sit regnum Dei.'  Haec implantatio fit a solo Domino, quare nihil caeleste 
apud hominem datur nec dari potest quod non sit a Domino et quod non sit Domini.  [5] Dominus autem ex propria potentia conjunxit Externum Suum Hominem Interno, et cognitiones implevit caelestibus, et 
implantavit caelestibus et quidem secundum ordinem Divinum, primum caelestibus pueritiae, dein caelestibus aetatis inter pueritiam et infantiam, demum caelestibus Ipsius suae infantiae, ita factus simul 
quoad Humanam Essentiam Ipsa Innocentia et Ipse Amor, a Quo omnis innocentia et omnis amor in caelis et in terris: talis Innocentia est vera Infantia quia est simul Sapientia; innocentia vero infantiae 
nisi per cognitiones fiat innocentia sapientiae, nulli usui est, quare infantes in altera vita imbuuntur cognitionibus. Sicut Dominus implantavit cognitiones caelestibus, ita perceptionem habuit, 
nam, ut dictum, ex conjunctione omnis perceptio: primam perceptionem cum scientifica pueritiae implantavit, quae perceptio significatur per 'quercetum Moreh': alteram, de qua hic, quae est interior 
cum cognitiones implantavit, quae perceptio significatur per 'querceta Mamre quae in Hebron.' </p>
