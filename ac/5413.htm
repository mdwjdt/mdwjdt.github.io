<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5413节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5413.</strong>“因为雅各说，恐怕他遭害”表没有属灵层的属天层，也就是“约瑟”，这居间层就会灭亡。这从“遭害”的含义清楚可知，“遭害”在此是指灭亡。这些话是便雅悯的父亲说的，因为他父亲爱他，唯恐他像约瑟那样在他的哥哥们中间灭亡。不过，这些话被引用并纳入圣言是由于内义，即：只有外在事物，没有内在事物，这居间物就会灭亡；居间物是“便雅悯”，外在事物是“雅各的儿子们”，内在事物是“约瑟”。事实上，一切居间物当只有外在事物，没有内在事物时，都会灭亡，因为它靠内在之物存在，因而也靠它持续存在；事实上，它存在是因着内在出于将外在与它自己联结的情感和目的而关注外在。因此，居间物与内在事物联结，并从内在事物延伸而与外在事物联结；不过，没有内在事物就不会与外在事物联结。由此明显可知，居间物若只与外在事物，不与内在事物同在，就会灭亡。更重要的是，按照普遍法则，无论灵界事物的法则，还是自然界的事物的法则，事物能与在它之先的事物一起持续存在，但若没有这在它之先的事物，只与在它之后的事物却无法一起持续存在。它若只与在它之后的事物一同存在，就会灭亡。原因在于，一切事物若与在它之先的事物没有联系，就没有与首先的那一位的联系，而首先者是存在并持续存在的一切的源头。</p>

For he said, Peradventure mischief may befall him. That this signifies that without the celestial of the spiritual which is "Joseph," it would perish, is evident from the signification of "mischief befalling," 
as here being to perish. This was said by the father because he loved him, and feared lest he should perish among his brethren, like Joseph; but these same words were adduced and received in 
the Word on account of the internal sense, which is, that with its externals only, without the internal, the intermediate would perish; for the intermediate is "Benjamin," the externals are the "sons 
of Jacob," and the internal is "Joseph." Every intermediate perishes when it has only the external things without the internal, because it comes into existence from the internal, and hence also subsists 
from it; for it comes into existence by the internal's looking into the external from the affection and end of associating the external with itself. Thus the intermediate is conjoined with the internal, 
and from the internal with the external, but not with the external without the internal. From this it is plain that the intermediate would perish if it were with the external alone without the 
internal. Moreover, it is a general law, as well of the things of the spiritual world as of those of the natural world, that a thing can subsist with its prior, but not without this with its posterior, 
and that it would perish if it were with this alone. The reason is that everything without connection with what is prior to itself is without connection with the First, from whom is all coming into 
existence, and subsistence. </p>

'For he said, Perhaps harm may come to him' means that without the celestial of the spiritual, which is 'Joseph', that intermediary will perish. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming to harm' here 
as perishing. These words were spoken by Benjamin's father because he loved him and was afraid that he would perish among his brothers, as Joseph had done. But they have been quoted and incorporated 
into the Word because of the internal sense, which is that if the intermediary is present with external things alone without the internal it will perish, the intermediary being 'Benjamin', the external 
things 'the sons of Jacob', and the internal 'Joseph'. Indeed the intermediary perishes whenever it exists with external things alone without the internal, for the situation with the intermediary is 
this: It derives its being from what is internal and is therefore also kept in being from there; for it is brought into being when the internal beholds the external, when the affection and intention 
exists there to link that external to itself. Accordingly what is intermediate exists joined to the internal; and extending from the internal it is joined to the external, but not to the external without 
the internal. From this it is evident that if the intermediary is present with the external alone it will perish. What is more, it is a law common both to things in the spiritual world and to those 
in the natural world that anything prior can remain in being with what is prior to that, but not with what is posterior without what is prior to it. If it exists solely with what is posterior it will 
perish. The reason for this is that everything unconnected to something prior to itself is unconnected to Him who is the First, the Source of all that comes into being and is kept in being. </p>

`Quia dixit, Forte obveniat illi damnum': quod significet quod id absque caelesti spiritualis quod `Josephus', periturum, constat ex significatione `obvenire damnum' quod hic sit perire; haec dicta 
sunt a patre, quia amavit illum et timuit ne periret inter fratres sicut Josephus; at eadem haec allata sunt et recepta {1} in Verbo ob sensum internum, qui est quod medium cum solis externis absque interno, 
periturum, medium enim est Benjamin, externa sunt filii Jacobi, et internum est Josephus; quod medium est, {2}hoc quoque cum solis externis absque interno, perit, nam ita se habet cum medio: hoc 
existit ab interno, inde etiam subsistit ab illo, existit enim per intuitionem interni in externum, ex affectione et fine sibi externum associandi; ita quod medium est, id conjunctum est interno, et 
(c)ab interno cum externo, non autem absque interno cum externo; inde patet quod id quod medium est, cum solo externo absque interno periturum. {3} Praeterea lex communis est, tam in illis quae mundi 
spiritualis sunt quam in illis quae mundi naturalis, quod prius subsistere possit cum suo priore, non autem absque illo cum posteriore, et si cum hoc solo, quod periturum; causa est quia omne absque 
connexione cum priore se est absque connexione cum Primo, a Quo omne existentiae et subsistentiae. @1 i sunt$  @2 etiam$  @3 i ita spirituale caelestis quod Benjamin, cum veris externis, quae filii
