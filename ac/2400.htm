<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2400节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2400.</strong>“告诉将要娶他女儿的女婿们”表连同那些被能与对良善的情感相联结的真理所主导的人。这从“女婿”和“女儿”的含义清楚可知：“女婿”是指对真理的认知，因而是指真理（参看<a href="2389.htm">2389</a>节）；“女儿”是指对良善的情感（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。由于经上说他“告诉将要娶他女儿的女婿们”，故它表示连同那些被能与对良善的情感相联结的真理所主导的人。因为这些情感能被如此联结起来，所以它们被称为他的“女婿”；但因为它们还未被联结，所以经上说“将要娶他女儿的”。<br />此处论述的主题是教会中的第三种人，也就是那些知道真理，然而却过着邪恶生活的人。事实上，教会里面有三种人：第一种是那些活在仁之善中的人；这些人由“罗得”来代表；第二种是那些完全沉浸于虚假与邪恶，弃绝真理与良善的人；这些人由“所多玛人”来代表；第三种是那些确实知道真理，但仍过着邪恶生活的人，这些人在此由“女婿”来代表。最后一种人主要是施行教导的人，但他们所教导的真理没有更深地扎下根来，仅习惯于做唯独存在于记忆中的知识，而知识的学习和展示只是为了名利的缘故。对这种人来说，真理被播种于其中的土地是我欲和物欲，所以他们对真理的信仰不过是由这些欲望所产生的一种说服。蒙主怜悯，这种说服的性质将在别处予以论述。他们在此被描述为不相信所多玛会倾覆、反而对此加以嘲笑的女婿。他们内心的信仰也具有这种性质。</p>

And spoke to his sons-in-law, that were to marry his daughters. That this signifies with those who were in truths, with which the affections of good could be conjoined, is evident from the signification 
of "sons-in-law," as being the knowledges of truth, and consequently truths (concerning which see above, n. 2389); and from the signification of "daughters," as being the affections of good (see also 
above, n. 2362); and because it is said that he "spoke to his sons-in-law, that were to marry his daughters," it is signified with those who were in truths with which the affections of good could 
be conjoined. As they could be conjoined, they are called his "sons-in-law;" but as they were not conjoined, it is said "that were to marry his daughters." [2] The subject here treated of is the third 
kind of men who are within the church, namely, those who know truths, yet live in evil. For there are three kinds of men within the church: first, those who live in the good of charity; these are represented 
by "Lot;" second, those who are altogether in falsity and evil, and reject both truth and good; these are they who are represented by the "men of Sodom;" third, those who indeed know truths, 
but nevertheless are in evil; these are here signified by the "sons-in-law," and are especially those who teach, but the truth which they teach has not sent down its root deeper than is wont to do the 
knowledge that is solely of the memory, for it is learned and vaunted merely for the sake of honor and gain. And because with such persons the ground in which the truth is sown is the love of self and 
the love of the world, they have no belief in the truth, except a kind of persuasive one derived from these loves, the quality of which shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. Such are 
here described by the sons-in-law, in that they believed nothing concerning the overthrow of Sodom, but laughed at it; and such is the faith of their heart. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2400</b></p><p><b>2400.</b>
'He spoke to his sons-in-law who were marrying his daughters' means together with those governed by truths to which affections for good could be allied. This is clear from the meaning of 'sons-in-law' 
as cognitions of truth, and consequently truths, dealt with above, in <a href="2389.htm">2389</a>, and from the meaning of 'daughters' as affections for good, also dealt with above, in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. And because it is said that he 
spoke to his sons-in-law who were marrying his daughters, the meaning is, together with those governed by truths to which affections for good were able to be joined. Because those affections could be 
so joined the expression 'his sons-in-law' is used, but because they had not actually been joined the expression 'who were marrying his daughters' is added. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Here the subject is a third group of 
persons inside the Church, that is to say, those who have knowledge of truths but nevertheless lead evil lives. There are in fact three groups of people inside the Church: </p>
<p><a href="1.htm">1</a> Those in whose lives the 
good of charity is present; these are represented by 'Lot'. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Those who are immersed completely in falsity and evil, and who repudiate both truth and good; these are represented by 'the men of Sodom'. <a href="3.htm">3</a> 
Those who do indeed have knowledge of truths but nevertheless lead evil lives; these are meant here by 'sons-in-law'. The last of these are chiefly people who teach, but the truth which they teach 
sends its roots down no more deeply than knowledge solely in the memory is accustomed to do; for it is learned and displayed by them solely for the sake of position and gain. And because with such 
people the ground in which the truth is sown is accordingly self-love and love of the world their belief in truth is no more than a certain persuasion, resulting from those loves. The nature of that 
persuasion will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of elsewhere. Here they are described as the sons-in-law who did not believe a thing about the overthrow of Sodom but laughed at the idea. And the 
faith within their heart is also of that nature. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2400</b>
</p><b>2400.</b>
Quod `locutus ad generos suos accipientes filias suas' significet quod cum illis qui in veris quibus conjungi potuissent affectiones boni, constat ex significatione `generorum' quod sint cognitiones 
veri, proinde vera, de qua supra n. 2389, et a significatione `filiarum' quod sint affectiones boni, de qua etiam supra n. 2362; et quia dicitur quod locutus ad generos (o)suos accipientes filias (o)suas, 
significatur quod cum illis qui in veris quibus conjungi potuissent affectiones boni; quia conjungi potuissent, dicitur `generi sui,' at quia non conjunctae essent, dicitur `accipientes filias.' 
 [2] Hic agitur de tertio genere hominum qui intra Ecclesiam, nempe de illis qui vera sciunt, sed usque in malo vivunt; sunt enim triplicis generis homines intra Ecclesiam: primum, qui in bono charitatis 
vivunt, hi repraesentantur per `Lotum'; alterum, qui prorsus in falso et malo, ac respuunt verum et bonum, hi sunt qui repraesentantur per `viros Sodomae tertium, qui quidem vera sciunt, sed usque 
in malo sunt, hi significantur hic per `generos'; sunt ii imprimis qui docent, sed verum quod docent, non altius radicem egit quam solet scientia solius memoriae, nam addiscitur et venditatur solum 
honoris et lucris causa: et quia humus apud tales in qua verum, sic est sui amor et mundi amor, iis nulla fides veri est nisi quaedam persuasiva inde, quae qualis sit, alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
dicetur; describuntur hic per `genera quod nihil crediderint de eversione Sodomae, sed quod irriserint'; fides eorum cordis etiam talis est. </p>
