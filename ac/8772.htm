<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8772节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8772.</strong>“这些就是你要对以色列人所说的话”表为叫真理能在良善里面被接受的流注。这从“说”的含义清楚可知，当由神性来说时，“说”是指流注（参看<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>，<a href="5481.htm">5481</a>，<a href="5743.htm">5743</a>，<a href="5797.htm">5797</a>，<a href="6152.htm">6152</a>，<a href="6291.htm">6291</a>，<a href="8128.htm">8128</a>，<a href="8660.htm">8660</a>节）。它之所以表示为叫真理能在良善里面被接受，是因为这句话论及以色列人，而以色列人表示属灵教会，属灵教会存在于那些处于含有真理在里面的良善之人当中。必须简要说明含有真理在里面的良善是什么意思。凡知道良善如何从真理形成的人都知道天上的最大奥秘；因为他知道人如何重新形成，也就是天堂或主的国在他那里如何形成的奥秘。一切基督良善或属灵良善都含有信之真理在自己里面，因为该良善的具体品质来自信之真理。良善若不从信之真理获得自己的具体品质，就不是基督良善，而是属世良善，属世良善并不能赋予永生。原因在于，属世良善只有属世生命在里面，而属世生命与动物的生命没什么两样，因为动物在温顺的时候，也处于良善；但动物不能接受属灵的生命。<br />由此明显可知，属灵的生命唯有通过信之真理才能获得。这生命，即属灵生命首先通过认识信之真理，此后通过承认这些真理，最终通过相信它们而获得。当这些真理只是为人所知时，它们可以说在前门；当被承认时，则在门厅；但被相信时，则在内室。它们就这样分阶段从心智的外层到心智的内层。不断从主流入的良善存在于内层人中，在那里与真理结合，把真理变成信仰，然后变成仁爱。这良善将真理吸引到自己这里，因为它渴慕真理，是为了它能通过真理为自己获得一个具体品质，并在这种情况下显现。<br />因此，当这些真理与良善结合时，此人便重生了；因为这时，他不再从真理，而是从良善来看待他当信的和当行的。这是因为他已经吸收真理，使它们住在自己里面；他也不再关心来自任何源头的真理，只对他自己能从自己的良善所看见的真理感兴趣。他不断看到更多真理，因为它们从这良善产生，如同后代从父母出生。这些后代由良善与真理的这种婚姻产生，该婚姻被称为天上的婚姻。该婚姻所生的真理含有良善在里面，因为它们从良善生出。这些真理以一个连续的系列进入良善，扩充并完善它，直到永远。由此也明显可知正在重生之人的两种状态是怎么回事。关于这两种状态，可参看前文（<a href="7992.htm">7992</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>；以及<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8539.htm">8539</a>，<a href="8722.htm">8722</a>节）。</p>

These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel. That this signifies influx for the receiving of truths in good, is evident from the signification of "speaking," when by the Divine, 
as being influx (see n. 2951, 5481, 5743, 5797, 6152, 6291, 8128, 8660). That it denotes for the receiving of truths in good, is because it is said of the sons of Israel, by whom is signified the spiritual 
church, and the spiritual church is with those who are in good wherein are truths. How the case is with good wherein are truths shall be briefly told. He who knows the formation of good from truths, 
knows the veriest secrets of heaven, for he knows the secrets of the formation of man anew, that is, of the formation of heaven or of the Lord's kingdom with him. All Christian good, or spiritual 
good, has in itself the truths of faith, for the quality of this good is from the truths which are of faith. Good which has not its quality from the truths of faith is not Christian good, but natural 
good, which does not give eternal life. The reason is that natural good has in it only natural life, which life is not unlike the life of beasts, for they also are in good when they are gentle; but 
beasts cannot receive spiritual life. From this it is plain that spiritual life is acquired solely by means of the truths of faith. [2] This life, namely, spiritual life, is first acquired by knowing 
the truths which are of faith, afterward by acknowledging them, and finally by believing them. When they are only known, they are as it were at the gate; when they are acknowledged, they are in the 
entrance hall; but when they are believed, they are in the inner chamber. Thus they advance from exteriors toward interiors successively. In the interior man is good, which is continually flowing in from 
the Lord, and there conjoining itself with truths, and making them to be faith and afterward to be charity. This good attracts truths to itself, for it has a longing for them, in order that through 
them it may procure for itself a quality and thus emerge. [3] When therefore these truths have been conjoined with good, then the man has been regenerated: for then he no longer looks from truths at 
what is to be believed and what is to be done, but from good, because he has been imbued with truths, and has them in himself; nor does he care for truths from any source than those which he himself 
can see from his own good; and he continually sees more, because they are produced therefrom like offspring from their parents. These offspring are from such a marriage of good and truth as is called 
"the heavenly marriage." The truths which are thence produced have in them good, because they have been born from this. These enter good successively, and enlarge it, and perfect it, and this to eternity. 
From all this also it is evident how the case is with the two states of the man who is being regenerated (concerning which above, n. 7992, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701; also n. 8516, 8539, 8722). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8772</b></p><p><b>8772.</b>
'These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel' means influx in order that truths may be received within good. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking', when done by the Divine, 
as influx, as in <a href="2951.htm">2951</a>, <a href="5481.htm">5481</a>, <a href="5743.htm">5743</a>, <a href="5797.htm">5797</a>, <a href="6152.htm">6152</a>, <a href="6291.htm">6291</a>, <a href="8128.htm">8128</a>, <a href="8660.htm">8660</a>. The reason why in order that truths may be received within good is meant is that what is said has regard to the children of Israel, 
by whom the spiritual Church is meant, and the spiritual Church exists among those governed by good that has truths within it. What is implied by good that has truths within it must be stated briefly 
Anyone who knows the way in which good is formed from truths is acquainted with the greatest arcana of heaven; for he knows the arcana concerning the way in which a person is formed anew, that is, the 
way in which heaven or the Lord's kingdom is formed with him All Christian good or spiritual good holds the truths of faith within it; for that good is given specific quality by the truths of faith 
Good that does not receive its specific quality from the truths of faith is not Christian good; instead it is natural good which does not impart eternal life The reason for this is that in itself natural 
good holds merely natural life, life that is not unlike that of animals, who are also governed by good when they are harmless ones. But animals cannot receive spiritual life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it 
is evident that spiritual life is acquired only through the truths of faith. This life - spiritual life - is acquired first by knowing the truths of faith, after that by acknowledging them, and at length 
by believing them When they are merely known they are so to speak at the front door; when they are acknowledged they are in the hall; but when they are believed they are in the room. Thus they pass 
in stages from the outer to the inner parts of the mind. In a person interiorly there exists good which flows in constantly from the Lord; and there it joins itself to truths, turning them into faith, 
and then into charity. That good draws truths to itself; for it desires them so that through them it may obtain for itself a specific quality, and in this condition manifest itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When therefore 
those truths have been joined to the good, the person has been regenerated; for the standpoint from which he sees what he ought to believe and what he ought to do is no longer truths but good. 
This is because he has absorbed truths, and these now reside within him; and he has no interest in truths from any source except those which he can see from his good. He is all the time seeing more truths, 
which are produced from that good like offspring from their parents. These offspring arise from such a marriage of goodness and truth, which is called the heavenly marriage. Truths which are products 
of the marriage hold good within themselves, because good gives birth to them. They enter into good in a continuous series, enlarging it and perfecting it; and they go on doing so for evermore. 
All this too goes to show the nature of the two states that a person who is being regenerated passes through, the states spoken of previously in <a href="7992.htm">7992</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>, and also in <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8539.htm">8539</a>, <a href="8722.htm">8722</a>. </p>

`Haec verba quae loqueris ad filios Israelis': quod significet influxum ad recipiendum vera in bono, constat ex significatione `loqui' cum a Divino, quod sit influxus, ut n. 2951, 5481, 5743, 5797, 
6152, 6291, 8128, (x)8660; quod sit ad recipiendum vera in bono, est quia dicitur de `filiis Israelis' per quos significatur Ecclesia spiritualis, et Ecclesia spiritualis est apud illos qui in bono sunt 
in quo vera.  Quomodo se habet cum bono in quo vera, paucis dicetur: {1}qui scit formationem boni ex veris, is {2}scit ipsissima arcana caeli, scit enim arcana formationis hominis e novo, hoc est, 
formationis caeli seu regni Domini apud illum; omne bonum Christianum seu bonum spirituale in se habet vera fidei, nam quale illius boni est a veris quae fidei; bonum quod non a veris fidei suum quale 
habet non est bonum Christianum sed est bonum naturale quod non dat vitam aeternam; (s)causa est quia bonum naturale in se modo habet vitam naturalem, {3}quae vita non absimilis est vitae bestiarum, 
quae quoque in bono {4} sunt cum mites; sed bestiae non possunt recipere vitam spiritualem; 2 inde patet quod {5}vita spiritualis solum acquiratur per vera (x)fidei; vita haec, nempe vita spiritualis, 
acquiritur primum per scire vera quae fidei, postea per agnoscere illa, et tandem per credere illa; cum modo sciuntur, tunc sunt quasi in ostio, cum agnoscuntur tunc sunt in atrio, cum autem creduntur 
tunc sunt in cubiculo; ita vadunt ab exterioribus versus interiora successive; in interiore homine est bonum quod continue a Domino influit, et ibi se conjungit cum veris, et facit ut sint fides, et 
dein ut sint charitas; bonum illud ad se attrahit vera {6}, nam est desiderium ad {7}illa, ut per illa sibi quale comparet, et sic 7 existat; cum itaque vera illa bono conjuncta sunt, tunc homo regeneratus 
est, nam tunc non amplius ex veris spectat quid credendum et quid agendum, sed ex bono, quia {8} imbutus est veris, et habet illa in se, nec curat {9} vera aliunde quam quae ipse ex bono suo videre 
potest, et videt continue plura, nam producuntur inde sicut fetus a suis parentibus; {10}fetus hi sunt ex conjugio boni et veri tali, {11}quod conjugium caeleste vocatur; {12} vera quae inde producuntur 
in se habent bonum, quia nata sunt (c)ex eo; haec intrant bonum successive, et ampliant illud, et perficiunt illud, et hoc in aeternum.  {13} Ex his quoque constat quomodo se habet cum binis statibus 
apud hominem qui regeneratur, de quibus prius n. 7992, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701; tum n. 8516, 8539, 8722.(s) 	@1 In A this sentence stands at the end of  .$ 	@2 After caeli$ 	@3 estque
