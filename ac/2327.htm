<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2327节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2327.</strong>“脸伏于地下拜”表谦卑。这是显而易见的，无需解释。在过去，尤其在代表性教会中，他们俯伏以致脸伏于地，是因为脸表人的内在（<a href="358.htm">358</a>，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>节）。他们脸伏于地的原因在于，地上的尘土表亵渎的和被谴责的（<a href="278.htm">278</a>节）。所以，他们由此表明这一事实，凭自己，他们是亵渎的和被谴责的。出于同样的原因，他们脸伏于地，甚至在尘土和灰中打滚，扬起尘土和灰落在头上，这从相关经文可以看出来（如耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.10.htm">2:10</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.30.htm">27:30</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥1.10.htm">1:10</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书7.6.htm">7:6</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.19.htm">18:19</a>等等）。<br />他们通过这些行为表现真谦卑的状态，人们若不承认凭自己他们是亵渎的和被谴责的，因而凭自己无法仰望主，主那里的一切事物都是神性和神圣的，就绝不会有这样的表现。因此，人越承认自己的状态，就越具有真谦卑，在进行敬拜时就越具有真正的虔诚。一切敬拜中必包含谦卑，没有谦卑就没有崇拜，因而没有敬拜可言。<br />谦卑的状态是敬拜本身必不可少的状态，原因在于，内心越谦卑，我欲及由此而来的一切罪恶越止息，这一切越止息，从主而来的良善与真理，即仁与信就越流入进来。因为阻碍接受这些事物的，主要是我欲。我欲里面含有与自我相比对别人的蔑视，并且若自我得不到尊敬，就会报复。我欲里面还含有无情和残忍，因而含有最坏的邪恶。良善与真理绝不会被引入到这些东西中，因为它们是完全对立的。</p>

He bowed himself with his face to the earth. That this signifies humiliation, may be seen without unfolding the meaning. The reason that in former times, especially in the representative churches, they 
bowed themselves so low that they let down the face to the earth, was because the face signified man's interiors (n. 358, 1999); and the reason they let it down to the earth was that the dust of the 
earth signified what is profane and condemned (n. 278); consequently they thus represented that of themselves they were profane and condemned. For the same reason they prostrated themselves, pressing 
the face to the earth, and even rolling themselves in dust and ashes, and also sprinkling dust and ashes upon their heads (as may be seen from Lam. 2:10; Ezek. 27:30; Micah 1:10; Josh. 7:6; Rev. 18:19; 
and elsewhere). [2] By all this they represented the state of true humiliation, which is possible to none unless they acknowledge that of themselves they are profane and condemned, and thus that 
they cannot of themselves look to the Lord, where there is nothing but what is Divine and Holy; on which account, so far as a man is in self-acknowledgment, so far he can be in true humiliation, and in 
adoration when in worship. For in all worship there must be humiliation; and if this is separated therefrom, there is nothing of adoration, thus nothing of worship. [3] That the state of humiliation 
is the essential state of worship itself, comes from the fact that so far as the heart is humbled, so far the love of self and all the evil therefrom ceases; and so far as this ceases, so far good and 
truth, that is, charity and faith, flow in from the Lord; for that which stands in the way of the reception of these is principally the love of self, in which there is contempt for others in comparison 
with one's self; hatred and revenge if self is not treated with honor; and also unmercifulness and cruelty; thus the worst evils of all; and into these good and truth can in no wise be introduced, 
for they are opposites. </p>

'And bowed down with his face towards the ground' means humiliation. This becomes clear without explanation. The reason why in the past, especially in the representative Churches, people would bow so 
far down that their faces touched the ground, was that 'the face' meant man's interiors, <a href="358.htm">358</a>,<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>. And they did so clown 'to the ground' because 'the dust of the ground' meant that which is profane and 
condemned, <a href="278.htm">278</a>. In doing this they represented the fact that of themselves they were profane and condemned. They therefore prostrated themselves face downwards on the ground, indeed they wallowed in 
dust and ashes, and also cast dust or ashes over their heads, as becomes clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2: 10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27: 30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%201:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 1: 10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%207:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 7: 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18: 19</a>; and elsewhere. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 By these actions they represented 
a state of true humility, which can in no way exist unless people acknowledge that of themselves they are profane and condemned, and so of themselves are incapable of looking towards the Lord where 
everything is Divine and Holy. To the extent therefore that a person acknowledges his own condition he can possess true humility, and when engaged in worship can have real devotion. For all worship 
must contain humility, and if separated from it no adoration and so no worship at all is present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason a state of humility is vital to worship itself is that insofar as the heart is humbled 
self-love and all resulting evil come to an end; and insofar as these come to an end good and truth, that is, charity and faith, flow in from the Lord. For what above all else stands in the way of 
their being received is self-love. Indeed within self-love there lies contempt for all others in comparison with oneself; there lies hatred and revenge if one is not venerated most highly; and there 
lies mercilessness and cruelty within it, and thus the worst evils of all into which good and truth cannot possibly be introduced, since they are completely opposite. </p>

`Incurvavit se facies in terram':  quod significet humiliationem, constare potest absque explicatione.  Quod olim imprimis in Ecclesiis repraesentativus, incurvaverint se usque adeo ut demiserint faciem 
in terram, causa fuit quia `facies' significabat interiora hominis, n. 358, 1999; et quod `in terram,' quia `terrae pulvis' significabat profanum et damnatum, n. 278; proinde sic repraesentabant, 
quod ex se profani et damnati essent, ideo prosternebant se faciem premendo in terram, immo se in pulvere et {1} cinere volutando, tum quoque pulverem aut cinerem super caput spargendo, ut constare potest 
ex Thren. ii 10; Ezech. xxvii 30; Mich. i 10; Jos. vii 6; Apoc. xviii 19, et alibi.  [2] Per haec repraesentabant statum verae humiliationis, qui nusquam dari potest nisi agnoscant quod ex se profani 
et damnati sint, et sic quod non spectare possint ex se ad Dominum, ubi nihil nisi Divinum et Sanctum; quare quantum homo in agnitione sui est, tantum potest in vera humiliatione esse, et tantum 
in adoratione cum est in cultu; nam in omni cultu erit humiliatio, quae si inde separatur, nihil adorationis est, ita nihil cultus.  Quod status humiliationis sit essentialis ipsius cultus, inde est 
quia quantum cor humiliatur, tantum amor sui et omne malum inde cessat, et quantum hoc cessat, tantum influit bonum et verum, hoc est, charitas et fides, a Domino; nam quod obstat quin recipiantur, est 
principaliter amor sui, in hoc enim est contemptus aliorum prae se, est odium et vindicta si non colatur, estque immisericordia et crudelitas, ita omnium pessima mala in quae nusquam inferri potest 
bonum et verum, sunt enim opposita. 	@1 aut.$ </p>
