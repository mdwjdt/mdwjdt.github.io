<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5986节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5986.</strong>值得一提的是，这种事发生过许多次，由此向我证明：无论在天堂还是在地狱，没有哪个人的思维、言语、意愿和行为源于这个人自己，而是来自其他人，因此最终每个人都依赖于来自主的无所不包的生命流注。当我听灵人们说，一个使臣所思所言的一切，无一源于他自己，然而这个使臣却以为这一切唯独来自他自己时，我常蒙允许与那些正流入这个使臣的灵人交谈。每当他们争辩说，和使臣不同，他们自己的思维和言语就来源于他们自己时，由于他们是真的这么认为的，所以我也蒙允许告诉他们说，他们的观念是错的。我进一步告诉他们说，他们和那个使臣一样，也是从其他人那里获得自己的思维和言语。为证明这一点，我被允许与正流入他们的灵人交谈；当这些灵人说得差不多一样时，我被允许反过来与正流入他们的灵人交谈，以此类推，接连不断。这证明，每个人的思维和言语都来自其他人。这次经历在灵人们中间激起极大的愤慨，因为他们每个人都渴望其思维和言语来源于他自己。但他们由此也被指教事情是怎么回事，故被告知，他们的整个思维，以及整个意愿，都是流入的，因为生命唯有一个，它是这些官能所拥有的生命之源头。这生命通过一种奇妙的形式，即天堂的形式，从主流入；它不仅普遍流入所有人，还具体流入每个人。它照着每个接受主体的形式，根据该形式与天堂形式一致或不一致的程度而处处不同。由此也明显可知人是什么情况，对此，等到下文论述流注时，我们再予以详述。</p>

It is worthy of mention (for it has often happened and thus been shown) that no one either in heaven or in hell thinks, speaks, wills, and acts from himself, but from others, and thus at last all and 
each do so from the general influx of life, which is from the Lord. When I have heard the spirits saying that a spirit does not think and speak anything from himself, and yet the subject supposed he 
did so solely from himself, it has then been frequently given to speak with those who were flowing into the subject; and when they persisted in the assertion that they thought and spoke from themselves, 
but not so the subject from himself, and because they supposed that they so thought and spoke, it was further given to tell them that this is a fallacy, and that they as well as the subject were thinking 
and speaking from others. In order to confirm this point, it was also given to speak with those who were flowing into these latter, and when they also made a like confession, it was further given 
to speak with those who were flowing into these, and so on in a continued series. Thus it became plain that everyone was thinking and speaking from others. This experience excited in the spirits the 
utmost indignation, for every one of them desires to think and speak from himself. But because they were thereby instructed how the case is, they were told that everything of thought and also of will 
flows in, because there is but one only life, from which are these faculties of life; and that this life flows in from the Lord through a wonderful form, which is the heavenly form, not only in a general 
way into all, but also particularly into each; and that it is varied everywhere according to the form of each subject, as this agrees or disagrees with the heavenly form. From all this it is also 
evident how the case is with man, of which more will be said in what follows, when treating of influx. </p>

It is worth my mentioning that it has happened many times and thereby been proved to me that no one person's thought, speech, will, or action - either in heaven or in hell - originates in the person 
himself but comes from others, so that ultimately every individual is dependent on the all-embracing inflow of life from the Lord. When I have heard others saying that nothing of a subordinate's thought 
or speech originated in himself, yet the subordinate imagined that it did come solely from himself, I have been allowed on many occasions to talk to those entering the subordinate. Whenever they would 
argue that their own thought and speech originated in themselves unlike a subordinate's - and because they really thought this was so - I have also been allowed to tell them that their idea is false. 
I have told them that they, exactly like a subordinate, derived their thought and speech from others. To prove the point I was allowed to talk to the spirits entering them; and when these spirits 
professed much the same, I was allowed to talk in turn to the ones entering them, and so on in unbroken sequence. This proved that each  individual's thought and speech came from others. The experience 
made the spirits highly indignant, for each of them wants his thought and speech to originate in himself. But because the experience served to teach them the truth of the matter, they were told that 
the whole of their thought, and of their will too, is something that comes into them, for the reason that there is but one life alone, which is the source of the life those mental powers possess. That 
life flows in from the Lord, employing an amazing form, the heavenly form; it flows not only into all people universally but also into each individual specifically. Variation occurs in every case, 
determined by the form each subordinate recipient possesses, in the measure that the form agrees or does not agree with the heavenly one. From all this one may also see what the situation is with man, 
who will be dealt with in what follows where influx is the subject.  </p>

Dignum memoratu est quod pluries factum, et inde ostensum, quod nullus neque in caelo neque in inferno, cogitet, loquatur, velit et agat ex se sed ex aliis, et sic tandem omnes et singuli ex communi 
influxu vitae quae a Domino:  quando audivi dicentes quod subjectum nihil cogitaret et loqueretur ex se, et quod usque subjectum putaret quod solummodo ex se, pluries tunc datum est loqui cum illis qui 
in subjectum influebant; qui cum confirmarent, quod illi ex se cogitarent et loquerentur, non autem subjectum {1}, (x)et quia putabant quod illi ex se cogitarent et loquerentur, datum etiam (x)est 
illis dicere quod hoc fallacia sit, et quod illi aeque ac subjectum cogitarent et loquerentur ex aliis; ad rem hanc confirmandam loqui etiam datum est cum illis qui in {2}hoc influebant; et cum {3}illi 
quoque simile {x}fassi sunt, etiam {4} cum illis iterum qui in hos, et sic porro in serie per continuum; inde patuit quod unusquisque cogitaret et loqueretur ex aliis; ex {5}hac experientia maxime indignati 
sunt spiritus, nam quisque (c)eorum vult ut cogitet et loquatur ex se; sed quia inde instructi sunt quomodo se res habet, {6}dicebatur ad illos quod omne cogitationis ut et voluntatis influat, 
quia vita est unica, ex qua (x)illae vitae facultates, et quod {7}influat illa a Domino per mirabilem formam, quae forma caelestis est, non solum communiter in omnes sed etiam particulariter in singulos; 
et quod varietur ubivis secundum formam cujusvis subjecti, qualiter haec cum forma caelesti concordat, vel {8} discordat{9}.  Ex his quoque constare potest quomodo se habet cum homine, de quo in
