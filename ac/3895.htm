<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3895节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3895.</strong>过着邪恶生活的人所用的邪恶与虚假的说服，以及真理的说服在来世具有这样的性质：可以说它会窒息其他人，甚至窒息被引入天使呼吸前的善良的灵人。因此，凡具有这种说服力者，都被主移走，留在地狱中。他们在那里无法互相伤害，因为他们彼此的说服都差不多，因此他们的呼吸是一致的。一些具有这种说服力的灵人来到我这里，想要窒息我，并且的确有所得逞，但主救了我。当时，主差来一个小孩子，他的在场使他们备受折磨，以致他们几乎无法呼吸。他们被保持在这种状态，直到大喊叫，然后被投入地狱。<br />过着邪恶生活的人所具有的真理的说服则具有这样的性质：他说服自己相信，真理之所以为真理不是因为他以良善为目的，乃因以邪恶为目的。也就是说，他确信他可以利用真理获得地位和名利。最坏的人就能具有这种说服力，他们似乎对真理很是热心，以致他们诅咒所有虽具有良善，却没有真理的人下地狱。关于这种说服，可参看前文（<a href="2689.htm">2689</a>，<a href="3865.htm">3865</a>节）。当这种人首先进入来世时，他们以为自己是天使，却无法靠近任何天使社群；一旦靠近，可以说他们就被自己的那种说服窒息了。他们就是主在马太福音中所说的那些人：<br />当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名说预言，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我就明明地告诉他们说，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）</p>

The persuasion of what is evil and false, and also the persuasion of truth when man is in the life of evil, is of such a nature in the other life that it as it were suffocates others, even well-disposed 
spirits before they have been inaugurated into angelic respiration. They therefore who are in such a persuasion are removed by the Lord and are detained in hell, where one cannot hurt another; for 
there the persuasion of one is nearly like that of another, and hence their respirations accord. Some spirits who were in such a persuasion came to me with the intent to suffocate me, and even caused 
somewhat of suffocation, but I was delivered by the Lord. A little  child was then sent by the Lord, at whose presence they were so tortured that they could scarcely breathe, in which state they were 
kept even until driven to supplications, and thus were thrust down into hell. [2] The persuasion of truth when man is in the life of evil is of such a nature that he persuades himself that truth is 
truth, not for the sake of good as the end, but for the sake of evil as the end, namely, that he may thereby gain honors, reputation, and wealth. The very worst of all are able to be in such a persuasion, 
and also in apparent zeal, to such a degree as to condemn to hell all who are not in truth, however much these may be in good. (Concerning this persuasion see n. 2689, 3865.) When such persons first 
come into the other life they believe themselves to be angels; but they cannot approach any angelic society; being as it were suffocated by their own persuasion as soon as they come near it. These 
are they of whom the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out demons? and in Thy name done many wonderful 
works? But then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:22-23). </p>

When persuasive argument supporting what is evil and false, or even what is true, is employed by one who is leading a life of evil, that argument is such in the next life that so to speak it suffocates 
others, even upright spirits before they have been introduced into angelic breathing. Therefore those with that power of persuasive argument are removed by the Lord and detained in a hell where they 
cannot do one another any harm, for one spirit's power of persuasive argument is almost the same as that of another, and so their breathing is accordant. Some who had that power of persuasive argument 
came to me with the intention of suffocating me, and also did suffocate me partially. But the Lord rescued me. At that point the Lord sent a young child, whose presence tormented them so much that 
they could scarcely breathe. They were kept in this condition until they cried out and so were thrust down into hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Persuasive argument supporting what is true with a person leading a life of 
evil is such that he convinces himself that the truth is the truth not because he has good as his end in view but evil. That is to say, he convinces himself of it so that by means of the truth he may 
gain in position, reputation, and wealth. Such power of persuasion can exist with the most evil people of all. They can be so zealous seemingly for the truth that they condemn to hell all who, though 
good exists with them, do not possess the truth. Regarding this persuasion, see <a href="2689.htm">2689</a>, <a href="3865.htm">3865</a>. When such people first enter the next life they believe that they are angels, but they are unable to come near 
any angelic community, being suffocated so to speak by their own power of persuasive argument. They are those of whom the Lord spoke in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did 
we not prophesy through Your name and cast out demons through Your name, and do many mighty works in Your name? But then I will confess to them, I do not know you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity.

Persuasivum mali et falsi, etiam persuasivum veri cum homo in vita mali est, tale in altera vita est ut quasi suffocet alios, et quoque probos spiritus antequam inaugurati sunt in respirationem angelicam, 
quapropter illi qui in persuasivo sunt, removentur a Domino et detinentur in inferno, ubi onus alteri non (x)nocere potest, ibi enim unius persuasivum paene simile est alterius, ac inde respirationes 
concordant: quidam {1} qui in tali persuasivo erant, ad me venerunt animo me suffocandi, et quoque aliquid suffocationis intulerunt, sed a Domino liberatus sum; infans tunc a Domino missus 
{2} est, a cujus praesentia ita angebantur ut illi vix respirare possent, in quo statu tenebantur usque ad supplicationes, et sic detrusi sunt in infernum.  [2] Persuasivum veri cum homo in vita 
mali est, tale est quod persuadeat sibi verum esse quod verum, non propter finem boni, sed propter finem mali, ut nempe lucretur persuasivo possunt opes, (m)omnium pessimi in tali persuasivo possunt 
esse, etiam in apparente zelo, usque adeo ut damnent ad infernum omnes qui non in vero sunt, utcumque in bono, de quo persuasivo videatur n. 2689, 3865(n); tales in principio cum veniunt in alteram 
vitam, credunt se angelo sed ad angelicam aliquam societatem non approximare possunt, ex suomet persuasivo ibi quasi suffocantur; illi sunt de quibus Dominus locutus est apud Matthaeum,     
 Multi dicent Mihi in (t)die illo, Domine, Domine, nonne per      nomen Tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen Tuum daemonia ejecimus,      et nomine Tuo multas virtutes fecimus? sed tunc confitebor     
 illis, Non novi vos, discedite a Me operatores iniquitatis,      [vii 22, 23]. @1 i quondam etiam$ @2 i ad illos$ </p>
