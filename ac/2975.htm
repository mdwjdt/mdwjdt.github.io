<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2975节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2975.</strong>“在赫人眼前”表照他们的理解，也就是说，照那些属于这个新的属灵教会之人的理解。这从“眼”和“赫人”的含义清楚可知：“眼”是指理解（参看<a href="212.htm">212</a>，<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>）节；“赫人”是指那些属于这新的属灵教会之人（参看<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>节）。前面经上说“亚伯拉罕在赫人耳边所说的话”（23:16），这表示照他们的能力（<a href="2965.htm">2965</a>，<a href="2967.htm">2967</a>节）。而此处经上说“在赫人眼前”，这表示照他们的理解。第一句暗示适合他们的意愿，第二句暗示适合他们的理解力，因为人在这两个部分上被改造。事实上，除非意愿和理解力达成一致，以至于合而为一，也就是说，除非善与真，或也可说，仁与信合而为一，否则，此人仍未重生。因为仁属于意愿，而信则属于理解力。正因如此，前面经上说“在赫人耳边”，而此处经上则说“在赫人眼前”。</p>

To the eyes of the sons of Heth. That this signifies to their understanding, that is to say, to the understanding of those who are of the new spiritual church, is evident from the signification of the 
"eyes," as being the understanding (see n. 212, 2701); and from the signification of the "sons of Heth," as being those who are of the new spiritual church (see n. 2913, 2928). It was said above (verse 
16), that Abraham spoke "in the ears" of the sons of Heth, by which was signified that it was according to their capacity (n. 2965, 2967); here however it is said "to the eyes" of the sons of Heth, 
by which is signified to their understanding. What was said before involves application to their will; but what is said here, to their understanding, for man is reformed as to both parts for if the 
will and understanding do not agree, even so as to make a one, the man has not been regenerated; that is, if good and truth, or what is the same, charity and faith, are not a one; for charity is of the 
will, and faith is of the understanding. It is because of this that it was before said "in the ears of the sons of Heth;" but here, "before the eyes of the sons of Heth." </p>

'Before the eyes of the sons of Heth' means according to their understanding, that is to say, the understanding of those who belong to the new spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the 
eyes' as the understanding, dealt with in <a href="212.htm">212</a>, <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, and from the meaning of 'the sons of Heth' as those who belonged to the new spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>. In verse 16 above it was said 
that 'Abraham spoke in the ears of the sons of Heth', which meant according to their ability, <a href="2965.htm">2965</a>, <a href="2967.htm">2967</a> Here however the words 'before the eyes of the sons of Heth' are used, which mean according 
to their understanding. The first statement implies that which conformed to their will, the second that which conformed to their understanding, for a person is reformed as to both these parts. Indeed 
unless will and understanding are in agreement so as to make one a person remains unregenerate, that is, unless good and truth, or what amounts to the same, charity and faith, make one; for charity belongs 
to the will but faith to the understanding. This explains why earlier on the words 'in the ears of the sons of Heth' are used, but here 'before the eyes of the sons of Heth'. </p>
