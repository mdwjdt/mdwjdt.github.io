<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1625节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1625.</strong>我还见过一种彩虹形像，它中间有一片如牧草那样的绿地；我发现太阳在一侧，故看不见。它照亮这地，所倾泻的光芒如此白亮，以至于无法形容。它的边缘则有闪光珍珠表面所发出的最迷人的色彩变化。这些及其它事物表明这些彩虹的细微部分是何形像，并有着无穷变化，这种变化取决于显现这种代表物之人的仁爱及衍生之信。在那些能看到他的美丽和荣耀之人眼里，他也类似一道彩虹。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1625.</strong> A rainbow shape with something grasslike and green at its center also appeared, and I sensed a kind of sun off to the side, out of sight, gleaming, and giving off a light so bright that it cannot be described. At the edges were the most beautiful variations of color possible, in a luminescent, pearly field.<br />These and other experiences showed me what a rainbow is like in its smallest components. They also showed me that there is no end to the number of variations, which depend on neighborly love and the resulting faith in an individual who sees them represented. That individual in turn looks like a rainbow to others when presented to their view in all her or his beauty and glory. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1625</b></p><p><b>1625.</b>
A rainbow form was also seen in the midst of which there was a green space, as of herbage; and there was perceived the semblance of a sun which was itself unseen, at one side, illuminating it, and pouring 
in a light of such shining whiteness as cannot be described. At the outer border or circumference, there were the most charming variations of color, on a plane of pearly light. From these and other 
things it has been shown what are the forms of the rainbows in their minutest parts, and that there are indefinite variations, and this in accordance with the charity, and the derivative faith, of 
him to whom the representations are made, and who is as a rainbow to those to whom he is presented in his comeliness and in his glory. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1625</b></p><p><b>1625.</b>
I also saw a rainbow shape which had a green area, the colour of grass, in its centre; and I was aware of a kind of sun to one side, and so out of sight, which illuminated it with a flood of light so 
white as to defy description. It was edged with most attractive variations of colour on a surface of shining pearl. These and other things demonstrated the forms that rainbows take in their tiniest parts, 
and that countless variations exist, which are determined by the charity, and faith deriving from this, of the person to whom the representation appears. He also resembles a rainbow to those who 
can see him in all his beauty and glory. </p>

</p><b>1625.</b>
Visa etiam forma iridis, in cujus medio viride quoddam herbaceum, et perceptum instar solis qui inconspicuus, a latere, illuminans et infundens lucem ita candidam ut describi nequeat: ad circumferentiam 
erant variationes colorificae venustissimae in plano lucido margaritico.  Ex his et aliis constare potuit quales formae iridum in suis minimis sunt, et quod variationes dentur indefinitae, et hoc 
secundum charitatem et inde fidem ejus cui repraesentantur et qui sicut iris est illis quibus in decore et gloria sua sistitur videndus. </p>
