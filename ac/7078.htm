<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7078节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7078.</strong>要知道，其它星球的灵人不会出现在我们地球灵所在的范围之内，而是在这个范围之外；有的距离很远，有的距离不怎么远，而且在不同的方向。其中一个原因是，没有哪两个星球的灵人具有一样的性情和生命；另一个原因是，他们在大人里面构成不同的领域。生命状态的不同造成了这种表象。但在至内层天堂，他们看似彼此分离。然而，水星灵不会出现在一个固定方向，或一个固定距离处，而是有时出现在前面，有时出现在左边，有时稍向后一点。原因在于，他们被允许周游宇宙，以获取知识，由此丰富他们的记忆。在灵人看来，他们的星球出现在背后，正如当他们思想尘世太阳时，尘世太阳的情形；因为尘世太阳的任何事物都是看不见的。它之所以出现在背后，是因为对那些在来世的人来说，尘世太阳处于完全的模糊之中，本身是黑暗；而天堂太阳，也就是主，出现在前面，即右眼前面，因为他们通过这个太阳拥有其一切光明。事实上，右眼不仅在理解力被真理光照的程度上，还在它被良善光照（<a href="4410.htm">4410</a>节）的程度上对应于理解力。主以这种方式出于良善关注一个人，并通过良善光照他。</p>

Be it known that the spirits of other earths do not appear within the sphere where the spirits of our earth are, but outside of it, some at greater, some at less distance, and also in different quarters. 
The reason is that the spirits of one earth are not of the same genius and life as those of another; also that they constitute different provinces in the Grand Man. The unlikeness of the state of 
life causes this appearance. But in the inmost heaven they do not appear separated from one another. The spirits of Mercury, however, do not appear in a fixed quarter, nor at a fixed distance, but appear 
now in front, now to the left, and now a little to the back. The reason is that they are allowed to wander through the universe to acquire knowledges, and thereby to enrich the memory. Their planet 
is presented to spirits at the back, as is also the sun of the world, when they are thinking about it, for nothing whatever of it appears. The reason why it is presented at the back is that to those 
who are in the other life the sun of the world is in complete obscurity, and is thick darkness; but the sun of heaven, or the Lord, appears in front before the right eye, because from this sun they 
have all their light; for the right eye not only corresponds to the intellectual sight insofar as it is illumined by truth, but also insofar as it is illumined by good (n. 4410). In this way does the 
Lord look at man from good, and illumine him through good. </p>

It should be recognized that spirits belonging to other planets do not appear within the sphere where spirits belonging to our planet are but outside, some quite a distance away, others less far, and 
also in different directions. One reason for this is that the spirits belonging to one planet do not have the same disposition and life as spirits belonging to another; and another reason is that they 
constitute different provinces in the Grand Man. Unlikeness in their states of life is responsible for this appearance of separateness; but in the inmost heaven they do not appear separated from one 
another. The spirits belonging to Mercury however do not appear in any particular direction or at any particular distance but are seen at one time in a forward position, at another over on the left, 
or at another slightly behind the back. The reason for this is that they are allowed to wander everywhere to acquire items of knowledge and thereby enrich their memory. Their planet is presented to spirits 
as being behind the back, in the same way as the sun of the world is when they think about it; for nothing at all of it is visible. The reason why it is presented behind the back is that to those 
who are in the next life the sun of the world is in complete obscurity and is itself thick darkness, whereas the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, appears in front, before the right eye, because it 
is the source of all the light they have. For the right eye corresponds to the ability to see with the understanding not only in the measure that the understanding is enlightened by truth but also in 
the measure that it is [affected] by good, <a href="4410.htm">4410</a>, so that the Lord views a person [with the eye of] good, and enlightens him by means of good. </p>

</p><b>7078.</b>
Sciendum quod spiritus aliarum tellurum non appareant intra sphaeram ubi spiritus nostrae telluris, sed extra illam, quidam ad majorem quidam ad minorem distantiam, et quoque ad diversas plagas; causa 
est quia spiritus unius telluris non similis genii (c)ac vitae sunt cum spiritibus alius telluris; tum quia alias provincias in Maximo Homine constituunt; status vitae dissimilitudo facit apparentiam 
illam; sed in caelo intimo non apparent a [se] mutuo separati.  Spiritus autem Mercurii non apparent ad certam plagam nec ad certam distantiam, {1} sed apparent nunc antrorsum, nunc sinistrorsum, nunc 
paulo ad tergum; causa est quia licet illis pervagari universum ad comparandum sibi cognitiones, et sic ad locupletandum memoriam; {2}planeta illorum sistitur spiritibus a tergo, similiter etiam sol 
mundi cum de illo cogitant, nam de illo ne hilum apparet; quod a tergo sistatur, (m)causa {3} est quia sol mundi {4} illis qui in altera vita prorsus in obscuro est et caligo; sol caeli autem seu Dominus 
apparet antrorsum {5} ante dextrum oculum quia inde illis omnis lux;(n) oculus enim dexter non modo correspondet visui intellectuali quatenus illuminatur a vero sed etiam quatenus a bono, n. 4410; 
ita Dominus aspicit hominem ex bono et illuminat illum per bonum. 	@1 i sicut spiritus aliarum tellurum,$ 	@2 ipsa planeta$ 	@3 i dicta$ 	@4 i et lux ejus$ 	@5 i est$ </p>
