<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1799节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1799.</strong>“看哪，那生在我家中的人就是我的后嗣”表主的国度将只有外在之物。这从“后嗣”和“继承”的含义清楚可知。成为后嗣或继承表示主国度中的永生。主国度中的所有人都是后嗣，因为其生命的源头就是主的生命，而主的生命是相爱的生命，他们由此被称为“儿子”。主的儿子或继承人皆由拥有主之生命的人组成，因为他们的生命来自主，他们由祂所生，即重生。由别人而生的人是别人的后嗣；所有正被主重生之人都是如此，因为这种情况下，他们正接受主的生命。<br />主的国度既有外在人，也有相对内在之人，还有内在人。居于第一层天的善灵是外在的，居于第二层天的天使灵相对内在，而居于第三层天的天使则是内在的。外在人与主的关系不象相对内在之人那样亲近，而相对内在之人与主的关系则不象内在人那样亲近。主出于神性之爱或怜悯，愿意所有人都靠近祂自己，以致祂不愿他们站在外面，即处于第一层天，而是愿意他们都在第三层天，若有可能，不仅同祂自己在一起，而且还在祂自己里面。这就是神性之爱或主的爱。但由于那时教会仅在于外在，故祂说了这些抱怨的话：“看哪，那生在我家中的人就是我的后嗣”，以此表示祂的国度将只有外在之物。但有关内在之物的安慰和应许随之而来，如接下来的几节所描述的。<br />前面已阐明何为教会的外在（参看<a href="1083.htm">1083</a>，<a href="1098.htm">1098</a>，<a href="1100.htm">1100</a>，<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>，<a href="1153.htm">1153</a>节）。教义凭自身并不构成教会的外在，更不构成教会的内在，如前所述。对主而言，使得教会彼此有别的也不是它的教义，而是照着教义的生活。所有教义只要是纯正的，就都视仁爱为它们的根本。教义除了教导人当如何生活外，还能教导什么？<br />在基督教界，使得众教会彼此分立的，正是它们的教义。他们由于这些教义而自称天主教徒、路德教徒、加尔文教徒，或改革宗教徒（新教教徒）和福音派教徒等等。他们被如此称呼仅仅因为教义。若他们使得对主之爱和对邻之仁成为信的首要事物，这种状态永远不可能存在。这时，其教义的不同仅仅是对于信之秘密的各种不同观点。而真正的基督徒会让每个人持守自己的良知，并发自内心说，人只有作为一个基督徒，即照着主的教导去生活，才是一个真正的基督徒。果如此，所有不同的教会将成为一个教会，而唯独源自教义的一切纷争都将止息。甚至这个人对那个人的一切仇恨会在顷刻间烟消云散，而主的国度也会降临到地上。<br />洪水后即存在的古教会尽管分散在很多国家，却具有这样的性质。也就是说，人们在教义上差别很大，但都使得仁爱成为首要事物。而且，他们是从属于生活的仁爱，而非属于信的教义的角度来看待敬拜。这就是经上说他们全都有“一样的口音、一样的话语”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创11.1.htm">11:1</a>）所表示的意思（参看<a href="1285.htm">1285</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1799.</strong> Indeed the "child" of my household is my heir means that only the outer dimension would exist in the Lord's kingdom, as can be seen from the inner-level symbolism of an heir and of inheriting. Becoming an heir, or inheriting, symbolizes eternal life in the Lord's kingdom. All people in the Lord's kingdom are his heirs, because their life comes from the Lord's life, which is a life of mutual love. That is why they are called his children. The Lord's children, or heirs, are all those who share in his life (because their life is from him) and have been born from him (that is, regenerated). Those who are born to a person are that person's heirs, so all who are reborn from the Lord are his heirs, since they then receive the Lord's life.<br />[2] The Lord's kingdom has people of little depth, moderate depth, and great depth in it. Good spirits, who inhabit the first heaven, have little depth. Angelic spirits, who inhabit the second heaven, have moderate depth. Angels, who inhabit the third heaven, have great depth. Those with little depth are not as close to the Lord as those with moderate depth, who in their turn are not as close as those with great depth. In his divine love and mercy, the Lord wants to have everyone near him. He does not want us to stay outside in the first heaven but to enter the third. If it were possible, he would like to have us not just beside him but in him. That is the nature of divine love — the Lord's love.<br />Because religion at that time was purely superficial, he complained here, saying, "Indeed the ‘child' of my household is my heir," meaning that as a result, only the outer dimension would exist in his kingdom. But a message of comfort follows in the next verses, as does the promise of deeper dimensions [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1800" target=_top>1800-1810</a>].<br />[3] The outer dimension of religion has already been defined (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1098" target=_top>1098</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1100" target=_top>1100</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1151" target=_top>1151</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1153" target=_top>1153</a>). Doctrine in itself does not make the outer shell; still less does it make the inner core, as noted above. The Lord does not differentiate religious movements by their doctrine, either, but by the way their members live what is taught. All doctrine — if it is true doctrine — looks to a life of love as its fundamental principle. What is the point of doctrine but to teach us how to be human?<br />[4] In the Christian world, it is doctrine that differentiates churches. Doctrine is the basis on which people call themselves Roman Catholic, Lutheran (or Evangelical), Calvinist (or Reformed), and other names as well.{*1} These names grow out of doctrine alone, which would never happen if we considered love for the Lord and charity for our neighbor the chief concern of faith. If we did, those distinctions would simply be differences of opinion on the mysteries of faith. True Christians would leave such issues up to the individual and the individual's conscience. In their hearts they would say, "A person who lives as a Christian — who lives as the Lord teaches — is a real Christian." One church would come out of all the different churches, and all disagreement due to doctrine alone would vanish. Even the hatred of one denomination for another would melt away in a moment, and the Lord's kingdom would come on earth.<br />[5] Right after the Flood the ancient church was like this, even though it was scattered through many countries. These countries differed greatly when it came to doctrine, but they still made neighborly love the main focus, and they regarded worship not from the viewpoint of doctrine (a matter of belief) but of charity (a matter of life). That is what is meant by the statement in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1" target=_top>Genesis 11:1</a> that they all had one language and the same words (concerning which, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285" target=_top>1285</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Calvinist or Reformed churches were founded on the teachings of the French Protestant reformer John Calvin (1509-1564). "Evangelical" is a somewhat broader designation, often encompassing both Lutherans and Reformed, although in Germany and much of continental Europe the term Evangelical (German evangelisch) has generally been used to mean "Lutheran." Swedenborg is probably using it in its broader sense here. [RS] </p>

Behold a son of my house is mine heir. That this signifies that there would be only what is external in the Lord's kingdom, is evident from the signification in the internal sense of an "heir" and of 
"inheriting." To become an heir, or to inherit, signifies eternal life in the Lord's kingdom. All who are in the Lord's kingdom are heirs; for they live from the Lord's life, which is the life of mutual 
love; and from this they are called sons. The Lord's sons or heirs are all who are in His life, because their life is from Him, and they are born of Him, that is, are regenerate. They who are born 
of anyone are heirs; and so are all who are being regenerated by the Lord, for in this case they receive His life.  [2] In the Lord's kingdom there are those who are external, those who are interior, 
and those who are internal. Good spirits, who are in the first heaven, are external; angelic spirits, who are in the second heaven, are interior; and angels, who are in the third, are internal. They 
who are external are not so closely related or so near to the Lord, as they who are interior; nor are these so closely related or so near to the Lord, as they who are internal. The Lord, from the Divine 
love or mercy, wills to have all near to Himself; so that they do not stand at the doors, that is, in the first heaven; but He wills that they should be in the third; and, if it were possible, not 
only with Himself, but in Himself. Such is the Divine love, or the Lord's love; and as the church was then only in externals, He in these words complained, saying, "Behold, a son of my house is mine 
heir," by which is signified that there would thus be only what is external in His kingdom. But consolation follows, and a promise concerning what is internal, in the verses that follow.  [3] What the 
external of the church is, has been stated before (see n. 1083, 1098, 1100, 1151, 1153). What pertains to doctrine does not itself make the external, still less the internal, as before said; nor with 
the Lord does it distinguish churches from each other, but that which does this is a life according to doctrinals, all of which, provided they are true, look to charity as their fundamental. What is 
doctrine but that which teaches how a man must live?  [4] In the Christian world it is doctrinal matters that distinguish churches; and from them men call themselves Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and 
Calvinists, or the Reformed and the Evangelical, and by other names. It is from what is doctrinal alone that they are so called; which would never be if they would make love to the Lord and charity toward 
the neighbor the principal of faith. Doctrinal matters would then be only varieties of opinion concerning the mysteries of faith, which truly Christian men would leave to everyone to hold in accordance 
with his conscience, and would say in their hearts that a man is truly a Christian when he lives as a Christian, that is, as the Lord teaches. Thus from all the differing churches there would be 
made one church; and all the dissensions that come forth from doctrine alone would vanish; yea, all hatreds of one against another would be dissipated in a moment, and the Lord's kingdom would come 
upon the earth.  [5] The Ancient Church just after the flood, although spread through many kingdoms, was yet of this character, that is, men differed much among themselves as to doctrinal matters, but 
still made charity the principal; and they looked upon worship, not from doctrinal matters which pertain to faith, but from charity which pertains to life. This is meant where it is said (Gen. 11:1), 
that they all had one lip, and their words were one; concerning whom see above (n. 1285). </p>

'Behold, a son of my house is my heir' means that in the Lord's kingdom there would be only that which is external. This is clear from the meaning in the internal sense of 'an heir' and of 'inheriting'. 
'Becoming an heir' or inheriting means eternal life in the Lord's kingdom. All who are in the Lord's kingdom are heirs, for the source of the life in them is the Lord's life, which is the life of 
mutual love, and for that reason they are called 'sons'. The Lord's sons or heirs consist of all who have His life in them, for it is from Him that their life comes, and it is from Him that they have 
been born, that is, regenerated. Those born of another are that other's heirs; and so it is with all who are being regenerated by the Lord, for in that case they are receiving the life that is the Lord's. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In the Lord's kingdom there are those who are external, those who are more interior, and those who are internal. Good spirits who dwell in the first heaven are external, angelic spirits who 
dwell in the second heaven are more interior, and angels who dwell in the third heaven are internal. Those who are external are not as close to or near the Lord as those who are more interior, and these 
in turn are not so close or near as those who are internal. Out of Divine love, or mercy, the Lord wills to have everyone near to Himself, so that they do not stand outside, that is, in the first 
heaven. His will is that they should dwell in the third heaven. and if possible not merely with Him but abiding in Him. Such is the nature of Divine or the Lord's love But since at that time none but 
external things existed with the Church, He complained of this in the words that occur here - 'Behold, a son of my house is my heir' - by which is meant that in His kingdom there would thus be only that 
which is external. But comfort followed, and a promise of internal things, as described in the verses that follow next. What the external aspect of the Church is has been stated already in <a href="1083.htm">1083</a>, <a href="1098.htm">1098</a>, <a href="1100.htm">1100</a>, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>, <a href="1153.htm">1153</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 By itself doctrine does not constitute the external aspect of the Church, still less the internal, as stated above. Nor on the Lord's part is it its teachings that make one 
Church distinct and separate from another, but its life in accordance with those teachings, all of which, as long as they present what is true, regard charity as their basic principle. What else does 
doctrine do but teach men the kind of people they ought to be? </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the Christian world it is their doctrines that cause Churches to be distinct and separate, and because of these they call themselves 
Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists or the Reformed, and Evangelicals, among other names. It is solely by reason of their doctrines that they are called by these names. This situation would 
never exist if they were to make love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour the chief thing of faith. In this case their doctrinal differences would be no more than shades of opinion concerning 
the mysteries of faith which truly Christian people would leave to individual conscience, and in their hearts would say that a person is truly a Christian when he lives as a Christian, that is, as 
the Lord teaches. If this were so all the different Churches would become one, and all the disagreements which stem from doctrine alone would disappear. Indeed the hatred one man holds against another 
would be dispelled in an instant, and the Lord's kingdom on earth would come. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The Ancient Church which existed immediately after the Flood, though scattered among many kingdoms, was of this nature. 
That is to say, people differed much from one another in matters of doctrine, but for all that, they made charity the chief thing. Also they regarded worship, not from the standpoint of doctrinal 
teachings which are matters of faith, but from that of charity which is a matter of life. This is what is meant by 'they all had one lip and their words were one', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2011:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 11:1</a>, regarding which see <a href="1285.htm">1285</a>. </p>

Quod 'ecce filius domus meae hereditans me' significet quod externum modo foret in regno Domini, constat ex significatione 'heredis et hereditare' in sensu interno; 'heres fieri seu hereditare' significat 
vitam aeternam in regno Domini; omnes qui in regno Domini, sunt 'heredes,' nam vivunt ex vita Domini quae est vita amoris mutui, et inde appellantur 'filii'; Domini filii seu heredes sunt omnes 
qui in Ipsius vita sunt, quia ex Ipso illorum vita, et ab Ipso nati, hoc est, regenerati; qui ab aliquo nascuntur, sunt heredes, ita omnes qui a Domino regenerantur, nam tunc vitam accipiunt Domini. 
 [2] Sunt in regno Domini, externi, interiores, et interni; spiritus boni qui in primo caelo, sunt externi; spiritus angelici qui in altero caelo, sunt interiores; angeli qui in tertio, sunt interni; 
qui externi sunt, non ita propinqui aut prope sunt Domino ac qui interiores, nec hi ita propinqui seu prope ac qui interni; Dominus ex amore Divino, seu misericordia, omnes vult habere prope Se, utque 
non foris stent, hoc est, in primo caelo, sed vult ut in tertio, et si posset, non modo apud Se sed in Se; talis est amor Divinus seu Domini: et quia Ecclesia tunc solum erat in externis, conquestus 
hic est, dicens 'ecce filius domus meae hereditans me,' quo significatur quod sic externum modo esset in regno Ipsius; sed consolatio sequitur, et promissio de internis, in versibus mox sequentibus; quid 
externum Ecclesiae, dictum est prius n. 1083, 1098, 1100, 1151, 1153.  [3] Ipsum doctrinale non facit externum, minus internum, ut supra dictum, nec distinguit apud Dominum Ecclesias, sed est vita 
secundum doctrinalia, quae omnia dum vera sunt, spectant charitatem ut suum fundamentale; quid doctrinale, nisi ut doceat quomodo homo erit? [4] in orbe Christiano sunt doctrinalia quae distinguunt Ecclesias, 
et vocant se inde Romano-Catholicos, Lutheranos, Calvinistas seu Reformatos, et Evangelicos, praeter alia nomina; quod ita dicantur, est ex solo doctrinali, quod nusquam ita foret si amorem 
in Dominum et charitatem erga proximum facerent principale fidei; tunc forent illa solum varietates opinionum de mysteriis fidei, quas vere Christiani unicuique relinquerent secundum suam conscientiam, 
et corde suo dicerent quod vere Christianus sit, quando vivit sicut Christianus seu sicut Dominus docet; ita ex omnibus diversis Ecclesiis fieret una, ac omnia dissidia quae ex solo doctrinali existunt, 
evanescerent; immo odia unius contra alium momento dissiparentur, et fieret regnum Domini in terris. [5] Ecclesia Antiqua proxime post diluvium tametsi per plura regna sparsa, usque talis fuit, nempe 
quod quoad doctrinalia inter se multum differrent, sed usque principale fecerunt charitatem, et cultum spectarunt non a doctrinalibus quae fidei, sed a charitate quae vitae, quod intelligitur per 
id quod 'omnibus fuit unum labium, et una verba,' Gen. xi 1, de quibus videatur n. 1285. </p>
