<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1640节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1640.</strong>我不仅能清楚察觉灵人对我说的话，还能知道他们说话时在哪个地方；是在头顶上还是头下面；是在右还是在左；是在耳朵上，还是靠近身体或在身体内部的某个地方；以及距离的远近。因为他们照其在大人中的位置，也就是他们的状态从各个地方或位置和我说话。<br />我还能发觉他们什么时候来，什么时候走，朝哪个方向去，有多远；他们有很多人，还是少数人等等。同时，我还能通过他们的言语察觉他们是哪类灵人，因为从他们的言语，如从他们所放射的气场那样明显可知他们具有何种天赋和秉性，及其纯正的信仰和情感是什么。例如，若他们是骗子，即便那时他们没有表现出欺骗，其欺骗的总体和具体性质仍能通过他们的每句话、每个观念被觉察出来。恶毒和恶欲的其它一切形式也一样。因此，无需仔细检查它们，因为每句话、每个观念里面都有这个灵人的一个形像。<br />人们也能察觉其言语的观念是封闭的还是开放的；以及哪些东西源于他们自己，哪些东西出自其他人，哪些东西源于主。这很像人脸上的表情，因为无需人说什么，仅仅看他的脸色，人们常常就能知道是否存在伪装、欺骗、喜悦，是自然的快乐还是强颜欢笑，是否发自内心友善，是否谦虚，以及是否疯狂。有时，这些东西也能从这个人说话的语气听出来。那么，同样的情形为何不该出现在来世呢？更何况，那里的直觉远远胜过此类觉察。事实上，在灵人开口说话之前，仅仅通过他的想法就能知道他想说什么，因为思维比言语流入得更快。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1640.</strong> Not only was I able to hear clearly what the spirits were saying to me, I could also tell just where they were at the time 钬?above my head or below, on my right side or my left, at my ear, somewhere else near my body or perhaps inside it, at such-and-such a distance far or near. I could tell where they were because they spoke to me from the various places or locations they were in, which were determined by their position in the universal human, or in other words, by their state of mind.<br />[2] I was also allowed to perceive when they came and went, where they were going and for how long, whether they were many or few, and so on.<br />From their speech I could tell what they were like, too, since their speech (like their aura) reveals clearly what their turn of mind and their character is, and what opinions and attitudes they hold as well. If they are deceitful, for instance, then when they talk, the general and specific type of their deceit can be detected in every word and thought, even if they are not lying at the moment. The same is true of all other vices and obsessions. These are so obvious that there is no need for lengthy investigation; an image of each is present in every word and thought.<br />[3] It is also possible to sense whether the thinking behind their words is closed- or open-minded, and what part comes from that individual, from other individuals, or from the Lord. It works almost the same as with the faces of people on earth, in which we can usually recognize pretense, fraud, gladness, cheer (real or fake), true friendship, shyness, or insanity, even if the person does not talk. Sometimes the same thing shows up in the tone of voice. Why not in the other life, then, where perception is far more sensitive?<br />In fact before spirits speak, their thought alone reveals what they are about to say, since thought is communicated more quickly and readily than speech. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1640</b></p><p><b>1640.</b>
I have been enabled to perceive distinctly not only what was said to me by spirits, but also where they were when speaking; whether above the head, or below; whether at the right hand, or at the left; 
at the ear, or at some other point near or within the body; at what distance, whether greater or less. For they spoke with me from the various places or positions in which they were, according to their 
position in the Grand Man,, that is, according to their state.  [2] I have also been enabled to perceive when they were coming, and when they were going away, and whither, and how far; also whether 
they were many or few; besides other things; and also from their speech to perceive their quality, for from their speech, in like manner as from their sphere, it is plainly manifest of what genius 
and of what natural disposition they are; also of what persuasion and what affection; so that if they are deceitful, even if there is no deceit while they are speaking, still the generic and specific 
character of their deceitfulness is perceived from every word and idea; and so with all other malignities and cupidities; so that there is no need of much exploration, for there is an image of the spirit 
in every word and idea.  [3] It is also perceived whether the idea of their speech is closed, or is open; also what is from themselves, what from others, and what from the Lord. This is much the 
same as it is with a man's countenance, from which, without a word, it is often known whether there is present dissembling, or deceit, or gladness, or cheerfulness natural or affected, whether there is 
friendliness from the heart, whether modesty, and also whether there is insanity; sometimes also the same is apparent from the tone of the man's speech. Why then should not this be the case in the other 
life, where the perception greatly exceeds such apperception? Indeed, before a spirit speaks, it is known from the thought alone what he intends to say; for thought flows in with greater rapidity 
than speech. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1640</b></p><p><b>1640.</b>
I have been allowed not only to perceive clearly the things which spirits have said to me but also to perceive where these were at the time of speaking- whether they were overhead, or down below, to 
the right or to the left, near to the ear or somewhere else, close to or inside the body, and how near or far away they were. For they have spoken to me from the various places or positions in which they 
were, according to their position in the Grand Man, that is, according to their state. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I have also been allowed to perceive when they were coming and when they were going away; in which direction 
they were going and how far; whether they were many or few; and other things besides these. I have at the same time perceived from their speech what kind of spirits they were, for from their speech, 
as likewise from the sphere emanating from them, it is quite evident what their character and disposition is, and what their real beliefs and affections are. For example, if they are deceivers, 
even though at the time they are expressing no deceit, the general and specific nature of their deceitfulness is nevertheless perceptible from their every word and idea. It is the same with all other 
forms of wickedness and evil desires, so much so that there is no need to scrutinize them closely, for the image of every spirit exists in his every word and idea. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 One is also able to perceive 
whether an idea belonging to their speech is closed or open, and to perceive as well what derives from themselves, what comes from others, and what springs from the Lord It is very much like the expressions 
on the human face, for from a person's face, without his saying anything, one usually tells whether there is presence, or deceitfulness, or gladness, or natural or else forced cheerfulness, or 
real friendliness, or bashfulness, or even insanity. Sometimes these things are also apparent from the person's tone of voice. Why then should the same not be so in the next life where perception is far 
superior to any discernment such as this? Indeed even before a spirit speaks one knows from his thought alone what he intends to say, since thought flows in more swiftly and sooner than speech does. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1640</b>
</p><b>1640.</b>
Datum est percipere, non solum distincte illa quae spiritus mecum locuti sunt, sed etiam ubinam tunc essent, sive supra caput, sive infra, sive ad latus dextrum, sive ad sinistrum, ad aurem vel alibi, 
juxta aut intra corpus, ad quam distantiam, remotius aut propinquius; nam ex vario loco aut situ in quo fuerunt secundum situm in Maximo Homine, hoc est, secundum statum suum, mecum locuti sunt.  [2] 
Percipere etiam datum quando venirent et quando abirent, quo et quousque, sique plures aut pauciores essent, praeter alia: tum quoque ex loquela eorum quales essent, nam ex loquela, similiter ac ex 
sphaera eorum, patet manifeste quo genio et qua indole sunt, tum quoque persuasione et qua affectione; ut si dolosi, tametsi cum loquuntur nullus dolus tunc, usque genus et species doli ex singulis vocibus 
et ideis percipitur; ita omnes reliquae malignitates et cupiditates, adeo ut non opus sit ut multis	explorentur, est in quavis voce et idea imago ejus.  [3] Percipitur etiam, num idea loquelae 
eorum sit clausa vel num aperta; tum quoque quid a semet, quid ab aliis, quid a Domino; se habet hoc fere sicut vultus apud hominem, ex quo absque loquela, cognosci solet num simulatum sit, num dolosum, 
num laetum, num hilare a natura vel arte, num amicum ex corde, num verecundum, etiam num insanum; quandoque tale apparet ex sono loquelae ejus. Quid non in altera vita, ubi perceptio multis excedit 
apperceptionem talem? immo antequam loquitur spiritus, noscitur ex sola cogitatione quid loqui intendit, influit enim cogitatio citius et prius quam loquela. </p>
