<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1507节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1507.</strong>有一个灵人在世时觉得自己比别人更伟大、更睿智。他在其它方面还算正直，与自己相比不怎么看不起别人。但由于出身高贵，他获得了一种优越性和权威性的气场。这个灵人来到我面前，很长时间没说话。但我发觉从他身上散发的一团雾将他包围，并开始笼罩其它灵人；结果，这些灵人开始感到苦恼。于是，他们向我开口说，他们无法呆在这里，因为他们丧失了一切自由，以至于什么也不敢说。他也开始与他们说话，称他们为他的儿子，有时还指教他们，不过却带着已习得的权威。这个经历清楚表明来世权威气场的性质。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1507.</strong> There was one person{*1} who in bodily life had viewed himself as greater and wiser than others, although in other respects he had been honorable enough, not holding other people in contempt on that account. Because he had been born to high position, however, he had developed an air of prestige and power.<br />As such he came to me and for a long time said nothing. I noticed, though, that he was surrounded by a kind of fog, which drifted out from him and started to envelop other spirits and then to distress them. Speaking to me from inside it, they said that they could not possibly stay there, that they were being robbed of all freedom, so that they did not dare to say anything. He too began to talk and addressed them, calling them his children and at various times instructing them, but always with the authority that he had acquired.<br />This experience showed me what an aura of personal power is like in the other world.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This spirit is identified as the biblical king Solomon in Swedenborg's unpublished work Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1507/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2681" target=_top>2681</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1507/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2700" target=_top>2700</a>.

A certain person during his bodily life had seemed to himself to be greater and wiser than others; in other respects he was well disposed, and not much given to despising others in comparison with himself; 
but as he had been born of high rank, he had contracted a sphere of supereminence and authority. In this character he came to me, and for a long time spoke not, but I noticed that he was encompassed 
as with a mist, which going forth from him began to cover the other spirits; at which they began to be distressed. Thereupon, addressing me, they said that they could not possibly stay there, for 
they were deprived of all their freedom, so that they did not dare to say anything. He also began to speak to them, calling them his sons, and at times instructing them, but with the authority that 
he had contracted. This showed the nature in the other life of a sphere of authority. </p>

There was a certain spirit who during his lifetime had seemed to himself to be greater and wiser than others. He was otherwise upright, and not so inclined to despise others in comparison with himself. 
But since he had been born among those of high rank he had acquired a sphere of supereminence and authority. This spirit came to me and for a long time said nothing, but I noticed that he was encompassed 
as by a mist which spread from him and began to envelop other spirits; as a result these spirits began to feel distressed. As a consequence of this they spoke to me, saying that they could not 
possibly remain as they were deprived of all freedom, so that they did not dare to say a word. Then that spirit began to speak; he addressed himself to them, calling them his sons, and at times instructing 
them, but with that authority which he had acquired to himself. This experience made clear what the sphere of authority is like in the next life. </p>

</p><b>1507.</b>
Quidam in vita corporis magnus et sapiens sibi visus prae aliis, alioquin probus, non ita alios contemnens prae se; sed quia in dignitate natus, sphaeram supereminentiae et auctoritatis contraxit: talis 
ad me venit et diu nihil locutus, sed animadverti quod sicut nimbo circumfusus esset, qui progrediens ab illo obvelare incepit spiritus; ex quo spiritus coeperunt angi; inde locuti mecum, dicebant 
quod nequaquam adesse possent, se privari omni libertate, sicut quod non ausint quicquam dicere; coepit is quoque loqui et cum illis, vocans eos suos filios, quandoque instruens, sed cum auctoritate 
quam sibi attraxerat: inde constare potuit qualis sphaera auctoritatis est in altera vita. </p>
