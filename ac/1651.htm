And it happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch, king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim,<br />2. that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom; and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah; and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela (which is Zoar).<br />3. All the latter gathered together to the valley of Siddim (that is, the salt sea).<br />4. For twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.<br />5. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, and they struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,<br />6. and the Horites on their mountain (Seir), all the way to El-paran, which is up in the wilderness.<br />7. And they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and struck every field of the Amalekites, and also the Amorite living in Hazazon-tamar.<br />8. And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar) went out and marshaled the battle with them in the valley of Siddim 钬?br />9. with Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim; and Amraphel, king of Shinar; and Arioch, king of Ellasar; four kings against five.<br />10. And the valley of Siddim was pit after pit of tar, and the king of Sodom and [the king] of Gomorrah fled and fell there, and the rest fled into the mountain.<br />11. And [the four] took all the resources of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went away.<br />12. And they took Lot and his property 钬?the son of Abram's brother 钬?and went away; and he had been living in Sodom.<br />13. And an escapee came and told Abram the Hebrew, and he was living in the oak groves of Mamre the Amorite,{*1} brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these were men bound by a pact with Abram.<br />14. And Abram heard that his brother{*2} had been captured, and he mustered his trainees, offspring of his household, three hundred eighteen of them, and pursued all the way to Dan.<br />15. And he divided [his forces] against [the enemy] by night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them all the way to Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus.{*3} 16. And he brought back all the property; and Lot his brother and his property he also brought back, and also the women and the people.<br />17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he returned (from striking Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him) to the valley of Shaveh, that is, the king's valley.<br />18. And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; and he was a priest to God the Highest.<br />19. And he blessed him and said, "A blessing on Abram from God the Highest, possessor of the heavens and the earth.<br />20. And a blessing on God the Highest, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." And [Abram] gave him a tenth of everything.<br />21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the souls, and the property take for yourself."<br />22. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted my hand{*4} to Jehovah, God the Highest, possessor of the heavens and the earth:<br />23. 钬楩rom the string of a shoe even to its strap, if I should take anything that is yours, ...!'{*5} To prevent you from saying, 钬业 have made Abram rich.'<br />24. Excepting only what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me 钬?Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; these shall take their share."{*6} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>Genesis 14:13</a>).

It is only here that the name is associated with an eponymous figure, otherwise unknown.

Lot is referred to here in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_14" target=_top>14</a> as Abram's brother, although he is in fact his nephew, as verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_12" target=_top>12</a> indicates just above and as Swedenborg himself notes below in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1707:2</a>. The Latin word here translated "brother" is frater, which Swedenborg uses to render the Hebrew (讗指谳 ['腻岣). This Hebrew word does indeed literally mean "brother," but it can be used more broadly to refer to any male relative (see Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, page 26 left column, under 讗指谳 ['腻岣, Strong's 251, definition 2).

"To the left" is a Hebraism meaning to the north 钬?that is, on the left as one faces east. Compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_joshua_19_27" target=_top>Joshua 19:27</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_46" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:46</a>.

"Lifting one's hand" is taking an oath; the oath follows in the next verse. [LHC]<br />{*5} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_23" target=_top>Genesis 14:23</a>).

The implied completion here would be something like, "may Jehovah punish me." [LHC]<br />{*6} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_24" target=_top>Genesis 14:24</a>). <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1651/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_1-24" target=_top>Genesis 14</a>, as the biblical scholar Gerhard von Rad observes, "contains some of the most difficult and most debated material in the patriarchal history, indeed in the entire historical part of the Old Testament." In essence it portrays the rulers of Canaan pitted against three major powers 钬?Elam (north of the Persian Gulf), Shinar (Babylonia), and the goiim (goyim), or "nations" (Hebrew 讙旨谠止讬执诐 [g么yim]). The last are probably to be equated with the Hittites, who had an extensive empire in Anatolia and the northern Fertile Crescent in the second millennium b.c.e. (generally thought to be the time of Abraham). Tidal is perhaps the Hittite king Tudhalia I, who ruled around 1730 b.c.e. Ellasar is usually equated with the southern Babylonian city of Larsa. While the general historical situation is plausible 钬?extrabiblical sources are full of accounts of coalitions of small states in Syria and Palestine against the empires to their northeast 钬?many of the details are not; for example, Elam was not in fact a great power at that time, and it is hard to imagine that it would be operating in Canaan. As a historical account, this is perhaps best seen as a kind of antiquarian compendium of chronicles that far antedate the biblical history. See von Rad 1972, 175-179. [RS]<br />1651.
