of Egypt in the seven years of abundance of produce. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them guard 
it. And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine that shall be in the land of Egypt, and the land shall not be cut off in the famine. "And now let Pharaoh see," signifies 
the looking forward of the natural; "a man intelligent and wise," signifies about the inflowing truth and good; "and set him over the land of Egypt," signifies that will bring into order all 
things in the natural mind; "let Pharaoh do this," signifies further looking forward; "and let him appoint governors over the land," signifies the orderly arrangement of generals in the natural; "and 
take up the fifth of the land of Egypt," signifies that were to be preserved and afterward stored up; "in the seven years of abundance of produce," signifies that had been instilled at the times when

the interiors of the natural mind; "and let them guard it," signifies there to be laid up in store; "and the food shall be for a store to the land," signifies that it shall be there for every use of 
the natural; "against the seven years of famine," signifies according to the need in cases of deficiency; "that shall be in the land of Egypt," signifies that shall be in the natural; "and the land shall 
not be cut off in the famine," signifies lest the man should perish. </p>
