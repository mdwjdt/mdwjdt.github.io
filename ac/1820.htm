<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1820.</strong>“我怎能知道必得这地为业呢”表针对主之爱的试探，主的爱渴望肯定这个结果。这从这些话本身所表达的怀疑清楚可知。凡经历试探之人都对所怀有的目的存有怀疑。这目的就是恶灵与恶魔所打击的爱，他们由此将目的置于怀疑中。爱越大，他们越将其置于怀疑中。若所爱的目的未被置于怀疑，甚至绝望中，就不会有任何试探。对结果的肯定出现在胜利之前，是胜利的一部分。<br />由于很少有人知道何为真正的试探，故在此作以简要解释。除了人所爱之物外，恶灵从不打击其它事物，并且这人对它们的爱越强烈，他们发起的攻击就越猛烈。打击那些属于对良善的情感之物的，是恶魔；而打击那些属于对真理的情感之物的，是恶灵。甚至一经发现人所爱之物的蛛丝马迹，或仿佛通过气味觉察到令他快乐和感觉珍贵的东西，他们就立刻攻击，并努力摧毁它，从而摧毁整个人。若非主驱赶他们，他们不会罢休，反而会永远持续下去。那些恶毒狡诈的恶魔通过刻意讨好人的爱而渗透到这些爱中，从而将这人带到他们中间。一旦把他带进来，他们很快就试图摧毁他的爱，由此以上千种难以想象的方式残杀这个人。<br />他们所发起的攻击不仅仅在于反对善与真的推理，这类攻击对他们来说不算什么，即便被打败上千次，他们也会持续下去，因为他们从不缺乏反对善与真的推理。但他们败坏善与真，并点燃某种恶欲和说服之火，以致这人只知道同样的恶欲和说服就居于他里面。同时，他们还从这人在其它事上所感受到的快乐那里抓取快乐，将其注入到这些善与真中。他们以这些方式对他进行最诡诈的传染和骚扰，并且他们通过把他从一件事引到另一件事上而做得如此娴熟巧妙，以致若主不帮助这个人，他永远不知道事情的真相。<br />他们以同样的方式攻击构成良知的对真理的情感。一旦发觉良知之物，无论其性质如何，他们就会通过人里面的虚假和软弱塑造一种情感，并通过这种情感使真理之光变得暗淡，从而败坏它；要不就引发焦虑，并折磨他。他们还使他的思维牢牢固定在一件事上，并使它充满幻觉，同时暗中将恶欲包裹在这些幻觉中。除此之外，他们还会运用不计其数、难以描述以至于无法理解的其它诡计。这些只是其中的一些手段，仅仅是最一般的那一类。他们以此能触及人的良知，因为他们最大的快乐就是首先摧毁人的良知。<br />这些话尽管非常少，但却表明试探的性质：一般来说，人的试探的性质如同其爱的性质。它们还表明主的试探的性质，主的这些试探最为恐怖。因为爱有多强烈，试探就有多恐怖。主的爱是整个人类的救赎，是最炽热的。因此，它是最高程度的对良善的全部情感和对真理的全部情感。一切地狱用最恶毒的诡计和毒液向这些情感发起攻击，然而，主全靠自己的力量征服他们。胜利具有这样的效果：恶毒的魔鬼和恶灵被打败后，就不敢再做任何事。因为他们的生命就在于能够摧毁。但当他们发现人能抵御他们时，他们在第一次攻击时就会逃之夭夭，就象他们仅仅接近天堂的门槛时所惯常做的那样，因为他们会立刻惊恐万分，猛然向后退却。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1820.</strong> The symbolism of "How will I know that I will inherit it?" as a test of the love felt by the Lord, who wanted reassurance, can be seen from the doubt that the words themselves express. Anyone who is being tested is unsure of the end.{*1} The end is love, and love is what evil spirits and evil demons attack, throwing the end into doubt. The more love the victim has, the more doubt they cast. If the cherished end did not become doubtful, even to the point of despair, there would be no struggle. Certainty about the outcome comes just before victory and is a part of victory.<br />[2] Few people know much about these challenges, so let me explain briefly here. Evil spirits never fight against anything but what we love. The more passionately we love something, the more bitterly they fight it. Evil demons combat anything good that touches our hearts; evil spirits combat anything true that touches our hearts. As soon as they become aware of something we love, no matter how small, or smell out anything dear and pleasing to us, they immediately attack and try to destroy it. In the process, they are trying to destroy the whole person, because our life consists in what we love. Nothing could possibly give them more pleasure than to destroy us. Nor do they ever stop trying (even if it takes forever) unless the Lord drives them away.<br />The malicious, deceitful ones worm their way into our central loves, stroking them and so awaking us to them. Once they have done so, they immediately set out to destroy what we love and consequently to kill us, by a thousand bewildering means.<br />[3] They do not fight by arguing against what is good and true. (That kind of fight is useless, because if they were beaten a thousand times they would continue to stand firm, since there is no end to the supply of arguments undercutting goodness and truth.) Instead, they pervert what is good and true, setting it aflame with the fire of appetite and delusion, so that for all we know we share their appetites and delusions. They also seize on some unrelated pleasure in us and feed the flames with it. In this way they very deviously infect and molest us. So skillfully do they work, as they spread their contagion, that if the Lord did not help us we would inevitably believe them.<br />[4] They level the same attack on the devotion to truth that forms our conscience. As soon as they detect a trace of conscience, no matter how imperfect, they take our misconceptions and weaknesses and shape them into a fog of emotion, which they use to block and distort the light of truth; or else they torture us with anxiety. Another device they use is to train our thoughts on a single issue, with no letup. They fill it up with crazy notions and at the same time secretly tie our cravings into the insanity. They have countless other underhanded methods as well, which could never be described intelligibly. Little of this reaches our conscious awareness, and only in its most general outlines; and it is our conscious awareness of right and wrong (our conscience) more than anything else that these evil spirits take the greatest delight in destroying.<br />[5] These few details — very few — give some idea of what it is like to be tested; in general, the nature of our trials matches the nature of our love.<br />This in turn indicates what the Lord's trials were like: the very fiercest of all. A trial is as fierce as the love is large. The Lord's love was to save the whole human race — a love that burned intensely. So his love comprised every desire for everything good and every desire for everything true, in the highest degree. This is what the hells all fought against, employing the most malevolent tricks and the most poisonous venom; but the Lord still conquered them all decisively, by his own power. Victory carries with it the consequence that malicious demons and spirits no longer dare to do anything. Their whole life depends on being able to destroy things, but when they sense that their victim has what it takes to stand up to them, they retreat as soon as they attack. The same thing happens when they near the first threshold of heaven; fear and horror immediately seize them and they rush away as fast as they can go.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In this paragraph, Swedenborg seems to be using "end" (finis in Latin) to mean both goal and outcome. Compare note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1820/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_978" target=_top>978</a>. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1820</b></p><p><b>1820.</b>
Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? That this signifies a temptation against the Lord's love, which desired to be fully assured, may be seen from the doubt that is implied in the words themselves. 
He who is in temptation is in doubt concerning the end in view. The end in view is the love, against which the evil spirits and evil genii fight, and thereby put the end in doubt; and the greater 
the love is, the more do they put it in doubt. If the end which is loved were not put in doubt, and indeed in despair, there would be no temptation. Assurance respecting the result precedes the victory, 
and belongs to the victory.  [2] As few know how the case is with temptations, it may here be briefly explained. Evil spirits never fight against other things than those which the man loves; the 
more ardently he loves them, the more fiercely do they wage the combat. It is evil genii who fight against the things that pertain to the affection of good, and evil spirits that fight against those 
which pertain to the affection of truth. As soon as they notice even the smallest thing which a man loves, or perceive as it were by scent what is delightful and dear to him, they forthwith assault 
it and endeavor to destroy it, and thereby the whole man, for man's life consists in his loves. Nothing is more delightful to them than to destroy a man in this way, nor would they desist, even to eternity, 
unless they were driven away by the Lord. They who are malignant and crafty insinuate themselves into man's very loves by flattering them, and thus bring the man among themselves; and presently, 
when they have brought him in, they attempt to destroy his loves, and thereby murder the man, and this in a thousand ways that cannot be comprehended.  [3] Nor do they wage the combat simply by reasoning 
against things good and true, because such combats are of no account, for if they were vanquished a thousand times they would still persist, since reasonings against goods and truths can never 
be wanting. But they pervert the goods and truths, and inflame with a certain fire of cupidity and of persuasion, so that the man does not know otherwise than that he is in the like cupidity and persuasion; 
and at the same time they enkindle these with delight that they snatch from the man's delight in something else, and in this way they most deceitfully infect and infest him; and this they do with 
so much skill, by leading him on from one thing to another, that if the Lord did not aid him, the man would never know but that the case was really so.  [4] They act in a similar way against the affections 
of truth that make the conscience: as soon as they perceive anything of conscience, of whatever kind, then from the falsities and failings in the man they form to themselves an affection; and 
by means of this they cast a shade over the light of truth, and so pervert it; or they induce anxiety and torture him. They also hold the thought persistently in one thing, and thus fill it with phantasies; 
and at the same time they clandestinely clothe the cupidities with the phantasies; besides innumerable other arts, which cannot possibly be described to the apprehension. These are a few of the 
means, and only the most general, by which they can make their way to man's conscience, for this above all else they take the greatest delight in destroying.  [5] From these few statements, and they 
are very few, it may be seen what temptations are, and that they are, in general, such as the loves are, and from this we may see what was the nature of the Lord's temptations, that they were the most 
terrible of all, for such as is the greatness of the love, such is the fearful character of the temptation. The Lord's love was the salvation of the whole human race, and was most ardent; consequently 
it was the whole sum of the affection of good and affection of truth in the highest degree. Against these, with the most malignant wiles and venom, all the hells waged the combat; but still the Lord 
conquered them all by His own power. Victories are attended with the result that the malignant genii and spirits afterwards dare not do anything; for their life consists in their being able to destroy, 
and when they perceive that a man is of such a character that he can resist, then at the first onset they flee away, as they are wont to do when they draw near to the first entrance to heaven, for 
they are at once seized with horror and terror, and hurl themselves backward. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1820</b></p><p><b>1820.</b>
'By what shall I know that I shall inherit it?' means temptation directed against the Lord's love which wished to be made quite certain of the outcome. This becomes clear from the feeling of doubt which 
the words express. Anyone who is undergoing temptation experiences doubt as regards the end in view. That end is the love against which evil spirits and evil genii fight and in so doing place the 
end in doubt. And the greater his love is, the more they place it in doubt. Unless the end in view which a person loves is placed in doubt, and even in despair, there would be no temptation. A feeling 
of certainty about the outcome precedes, and is part of, victory. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since few people know what temptations really are, let a brief explanation of them be given here. Evil spirits never contend against 
any other things than those which a person loves, and the more intensely he loves them the more fiercely do those spirits contend. Evil genii are the ones that contend against the things of affection 
for what is good, and evil spirits are the ones that do so against the affection for what is true. As soon as they detect even the smallest thing that a person loves or get a scent, so to speak, 
of what is delightful and precious to him, they attack it instantly and try to destroy it, and so the whole person, since his life consists in his loves. Nothing ever gives them greater delight than 
to destroy a person; nor would they leave off but would continue even for ever, if the Lord did not drive them away. Those who are ill-disposed and deceitful worm their way into those very loves by flattering 
them, and in this way they bring a person in among themselves. And once they have so brought him in, they very soon try to destroy his loves and so to slay that person, which they do in a thousand 
unimaginable ways. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Nor are the attacks which they make solely those in which they reason against goods and truths - the making of such attacks being nothing to them, for if they were defeated 
a thousand times over they would carry on with them because their supply of reasonings against goods and truths can never be exhausted. Rather, in their attacks, they pervert goods and truths, setting 
these ablaze with a certain kind of evil desire and of persuasion, so that the person himself does not know any other than that similar desire and persuasion reign within him. At the same time 
they infuse those goods and truths with delight which they seize from the delight which that person has in some other thing. In these ways they infect and infest him most deceitfully, doing it all so 
skillfully by leading him from the one thing to another that if the Lord did not come to his aid, that person would never know other than that it was indeed so. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 They act in similar ways against 
the affections for truth that constitute conscience. As soon as they become aware of anything, whatever the nature of it, that is a constituent part of that conscience, they mould an affection out of 
the falsities and weaknesses that exist with that person, and by means of that affection they dim the light of truth and so pervert it, or else they cause him anxiety and torment. In addition to this 
they keep his thought firmly fixed on one single thing; and they fill that thought with delusions, at the same time secretly incorporating evil desires within those delusions. Besides this they use countless 
other devices which cannot possibly be described so as to be understood. These are a few of the ways - and only very general ones- by which they are able to get at a person's conscience, which 
above all else they take the greatest delight in destroying. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These few, indeed very few, observations show the nature of temptations- in general that the nature of a person's temptations is as 
the nature of his loves. They also show the nature of the Lord's temptations, that these were the most dreadful of all, for as is the intensity of the love so is the dreadfulness of the temptations. 
The Lord's love- a most ardent love - was the salvation of the whole human race; it was therefore a total affection for good and affection for truth in the highest degree. Against these all the hells 
contended, employing the most malicious forms of guile and venom, but the Lord nevertheless conquered them all by His own power. Victories have this effect, that after they have been won, wicked genii 
and spirits do not dare to attempt anything; for their life consists in their being able to destroy, but when they perceive that a person is able to withstand them, they flee even when they are making 
their first assault, as they usually do when they draw near to merely the threshold of heaven. They are straightaway gripped with horror and dread and hurl themselves back in retreat. </p>

</p><b>1820.</b>
'Ex quo cognoscam quod hereditabo illam': quod significet tentationem contra amorem Domini, qui voluit certus fieri, constare potest ex dubitatione quae in ipsis verbis est; qui in tentatione est, is 
in dubio est de fine; finis est amor, contra quem pugnant mali spiritus et mali genii, et ponunt sic finem in dubio, et eo magis in dubio, quo magis amat; nisi finis qui amatur, poneretur in dubio, 
immo in desperatione, nulla foret tentatio; certitudo de eventu praecedit victoriam, et est victoriae.  [2] Quia pauci sciunt quomodo se tentationes habent, licet breviter hic exponere; mali spiritus 
nusquam pugnant contra alia quam quae homo amat, et eo acrius pugnant, quo ardentius amat; mali genii sunt qui pugnant contra illa quae sunt affectionis boni, et mali spiritus contra illa quae sunt affectionis 
veri; ut primum animadvertunt vel minimum quod homo amat, aut appercipiunt quasi olfactu quod ei jucundum et carum est, ilico hoc aggrediuntur et conantur destruere, ita totum hominem, quia 
vita ejus consistit in amoribus ejus; sic destruere hominem nihil usquam iis jucundius est; nec desistunt si vel foret in aeternum, nisi a Domino rejiciantur: qui maligni sunt et dolosi, insinuant se 
in ipsos amores, illis adblandiendo, et sic introducunt hominem, et mox cum sic introduxerint, destruere amores, et sic necare hominem tentant, et hoc mille modis qui incomprehensibiles sunt: [3] nec 
pugnant eo modo quod ratiocinentur contra bona et vera; tales pugnae sunt nihili, nam si millies vincerentur, usque insistunt, quippe ratiocinia contra bona et vera nusquam deesse possunt; sed pervertunt 
bona et vera, et inflammant quodam igne cupiditatis et persuasionis ut non sciat homo aliter quam quod in simili cupiditate et persuasione sit, et accendunt illa simul jucundo, quod arripiunt ex hominis 
jucundo aliunde, et sic dolosissime inficiunt et infestant, et hoc tam solerter ferendo ab uno in alterum ut nisi Dominus opem ferret, nusquam sciret homo aliter ac quod ita sit: [4] similiter 
contra affectiones veri quae faciunt conscientiam; ut primum appercipiunt aliquid conscientiae qualecumque sit, ex falsis et infirmis apud hominem formant sibi affectionem, et per hanc veri lucem inumbrant 
et sic pervertunt, vel anxietatem inducunt et cruciant; praeter quod cogitationem pertinaciter teneant in una re, et sic phantasiis illam implent, et simul tunc clandestine cupiditates phantasiis 
involvunt; praeter innumerabiles alias artes quae nusquam describi possunt ad captum; pauca sunt, et communissima modo, quae ad conscientiam hominis pervenire possunt, quam prae aliis destruere maxime 
delectantur.  [5] Ex his paucis, immo paucissimis, constare potest quales sunt tentationes, in genere quod tales sint tentationes quales amores: inde quoque constare potest quales tentationes Domini 
quod omnium atrocissimae; quantus enim est amor, tanta atrocitas est; Domini amor fuit salus universi generis humani ardentissimus, proinde omnis affectio boni et affectio veri, in supremo gradu; contra 
haec pugnarunt malignissimis dolis et venenis omnia inferna, sed usque omnia evicit Dominus propria potentia; victoriae hoc secum habent, quod maligni genii et spiritus dein nihil ausint; vita enim 
eorum consistit in eo ut possint destruere, sed cum percipiunt hominem talem esse ut resistere possit, in primo aggressu tunc aufugiunt, sicut solent dum ad primum limen caeli accedunt; horrore et 
terrore ilico corripiuntur et se praecipitant retro. </p>
