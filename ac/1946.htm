<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1946.</strong>“可以给他起名叫以实玛利”表它的生命状态。古时候，给儿女所取的名字表示其父母所处的状态，尤其母亲在怀孕，或与孩子同在，或生出他们之时所经历的状态，以使名字具有相应的含义。此处解释了以实玛利之名的来源，即“因为耶和华听见了你的苦楚”，这是指他母亲的状态。下一节将描述以实玛利代表什么。</p>

And thou shalt call his name Ishmael. This signifies the state of the life. In ancient times names were bestowed on sons and daughters that were significant of the state in which the parents were, especially 
the mothers when they conceived, or while they were with child, or when they brought forth; or the state in which the infants were when born, so that the names were significative. From what Ishmael 
had his name is here explained, namely, "because Jehovah hearkened to the affliction," referring to his mother's state. But what Ishmael represents is described in the verse following. </p>

'And you will call his name Ishmael' means its state of life. In ancient times sons and daughters used to be given names which meant the state that their parents were passing through, especially that 
of their mothers at the time of conception, or while they were with child, or when they gave birth, or after their infants had been born. Names accordingly carried a meaning. The origin of Ishmael's 
name is explained here, namely 'because Jehovah has hearkened to your affliction', which was his mother's state. What Ishmael represents however is described in the next verse. </p>

`Et appellabis nomen ejus Jishmael': quod significet statum vitae: antiquitus nomina indebantur filiis et filiabus quae significabant statum in quo fuerunt parentes, imprimis matres cum conceperunt, 
vel cum gravidae fuerunt, vel cum pepererunt, vel in quo fuerunt infantes cum nati: ita nomina fuerunt significativa: unde Ismael suum nomen habuit, explicatur hic, nempe `quia audivit Jehovah ad afflictionem' 
quod fuit status matris; quid autem Ismael repraesentat, describitur in versu sequente. </p>
