<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6443节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6443.</strong>“晚上瓜分猎物”表在他们仍处于模糊的时候，他们在主国度的产业。这从“晚上”和“瓜分猎物”的含义清楚可知：“晚上”是指模糊之物或模糊（参看<a href="3056.htm">3056</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>节）；“瓜分猎物”是指赐予天国的产业。因为“猎物”表示那些被主搭救和救拔的人，因此“瓜分猎物”表示分配，即把他们分配在天上的人当中，这就等于他们在主的国度拥有一份产业，或说在主的国度赐予他们一份产业。之所以说这事发生在“晚上”，是因为被提升到天堂的人一开始处于模糊之中；事实上，他们不可能进入清晰的光中，直到他们来到天堂，从主通过被其社群差遣给他们的天使被教导真理。因为驱散由虚假所造成的这种模糊需要一段时间。</p>

And at even he shall divide the prey. That this signifies their possession in the Lord's kingdom when as yet they are in obscurity, is evident from the signification of "evening," as being what is obscure 
(see n. 3056, 3833); and from the signification of "dividing the prey," as being to give a possession in the heavenly kingdom; for by "prey" are signified those who have been rescued and delivered 
by the Lord; hence by "dividing the prey" is signified distribution, namely, among those who are in heaven, which is the same as their having a possession in the Lord's kingdom. This is said to be 
done "in the evening," because they who are being elevated into heaven are at first in obscurity; for they cannot come to clearness until they have been in heaven, and have been instructed with respect 
to truths by the Lord through the angels, into whose society they are sent; for there is need of time in order that the obscurity induced by falsities may be dissipated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6443</b></p><p><b>6443.</b>
'And at evening he will divide the plunder' means their possession in the Lord's kingdom, while they are still in obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'evening' as obscurity, dealt with in <a href="3056.htm">3056</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, and from the meaning of 'dividing the plunder' as granting a possession in the heavenly kingdom. For 'the plunder' means those who have been rescued and delivered by the Lord, and therefore 
'dividing the plunder means a distribution, a distribution made to them among those who are in heaven, which is the same as a possession granted them in the Lord's kingdom. The reason why this is said 
to happen 'in the evening' is that people raised into heaven are at first in obscurity, for they cannot enter clear light until they have come to be in heaven and have learned from the Lord about truths 
through the angels into whose community they are sent. For a period of time is needed for the purpose of dispelling the obscurity brought on by falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6443</b>
</p><b>6443.</b>
`Et  ad  vesperam  dividet  praedam':  quod  significet  possessionem eorum in regno Domini dum adhuc sunt in obscuro, constat a significatione `vesperae' quod sit obscurum, de qua n. (x)3056, 3833; 
et ex significatione `dividere praedam' quod sit possessionem dare in regno caelesti; per `praedam' enim significantur illi qui erepti et liberati sunt a Domino, inde per `dividere praedam' significatur 
 distributio {1}, nempe inter illos qui in caelo sunt, quod idem est cum possessione eorum in regno Domini.  Quod dicatur hoc fieri `in vespera', est quia illi qui elevantur in caelum, primum in obscuro 
sunt, nam ad clarum non venire possunt priusquam in caelo fuerunt, et a Domino per angelos in quorum societatem mittuntur, instructi sunt de veris; spatio temporis enim opus est, ut obscurum a 
falsis inductum dissipetur. @1 i illorum$ </p>
