<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8200.</strong>“摩西向海伸手”表神之真理向地狱行使能力。这从“伸手”和“海”的含义，以及“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“伸手”是指行使能力（参看<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>，<a href="8183.htm">8183</a>节）；“摩西”是指神之真理，如前面频繁所述；“海”，此处即红海，是指地狱（<a href="8099.htm">8099</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>节）。之所以“神之真理行使能力”，是因为神的全部能力通过从主发出的真理来行使。这真理创造万物，正如约翰福音中所说的：<br />万物是藉着圣言造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">1:3</a>）<br />“圣言”是指神性真理方面的主；天堂和地狱里的万物都是通过这真理被排列成序；这真理也是地上万物的源头，并且一切神迹都是通过它实现的。简言之，神性真理含有一切能力在自己里面，如此彻底以致它就是能力本身。<br />在来世，有些人拥有真理的丰富程度超过其他人。这赋予他们如此大的能力，以致他们能毫无危险地通过地狱。在这些人面前，地狱里的人四处逃窜。还有些人通过从神来的真理奇迹般地行使能力。蒙主的神性怜悯，等到论述地狱时，我们将在各章节末尾详述这些人和前者。从外在和世俗事物的角度来考虑事物原因的人不可避免地将从神来的真理视为只存在于思维层面，除此之外没有真实存在的某种事物。然而，这真理却是至高的本质实体，两个世界，即灵界和自然界的一切事物都从这本质实质获得自己的存在。</p>

And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. That this signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine over hell, is evident from the signification of "stretching out the hand," as being the rule of 
power (see n. 7673, 8183); from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine (of which frequently); and from the signification of "the sea," here the sea Suph, as being hell (n. 8099, 8137, 8138). 
It is said "the rule of the power of truth Divine," because all Divine power is through the truth which proceeds from the Lord. This created all things, according to this in John: </p>
<p>     All things 
were made by means of the Word, and without Him was not anything made that was made (John 1:3); </p>
<p>"the Word" denotes the Lord as to Divine truth; by means of this truth all things in heaven and in hell 
are set in order; from this also is all order on the earth; all the miracles were brought by means of it; in short, Divine truth has in it all power, insomuch that it is power itself. There are some 
in the other life who are in truth in advance of others, and they are in such power therefrom that they can pass through the hells without any danger. They who are in the hells flee in every direction 
at their presence. There are some also who by means of truth from the Divine exercise power magically. Of the Lord's Divine mercy more shall be said of both of these at the end of the chapters, when 
the hells will be spoken of. They who pay attention to the causes of things from things external and earthly, cannot perceive otherwise than that truth from the Divine is a mere affair of thought, of 
no real essence; but on the contrary it is the veriest essentiality from which are all the essences of things in both worlds, the spiritual and the natural. </p>

'And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea' means the exercising of power by God's truth over hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'stretching out the hand' as an exercising of power, dealt with 
in <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>, <a href="8183.htm">8183</a>; from the representation of 'Moses' as God's truth, dealt with often; and from the meaning of 'the sea', in this case the Sea Suph, as hell, dealt with in <a href="8099.htm">8099</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> The expression 
'the exercising of power by God's truth' is used because God's total power is exercised through the truth that emanates from the Lord. This truth created all things, according to the following in 
John, </p>
<blockquote>
All things were made through the Word, and without Him nothing was made that was made. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Word' is the Lord in respect of Divine Truth. Through this Truth all things in heaven 
and in hell are arranged into order. It is the source of all order on earth too; and all miracles were accomplished through it.  </p>
<p></p>

 In short, Divine Truth holds all power within itself, so completely 
that it is power itself. There are some in the next life who possess truth in fuller measure than others. This gives them power which is so great that they can pass through hell without any risk 
to themselves. At the presence of these people those in hell flee this way and that. There are also some who use the truth from God to exercise power magically. These and the former will be spoken of 
at the ends of chapters, in which in the Lord's Divine mercy the hells will be the subject.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> People who contemplate the causes of things from the standpoint of external and worldly matters inevitably 
see the truth from God as something that exists merely on a thought-level and has no real existence beyond that. That truth however is the supreme essential entity from which all things in both worlds 
- the spiritual world and the natural world - derive their existence.

`Et extendit Moscheh manum suam super mare': quod significet dominium potentiae veri Divini super infernum, constat ex significatione `extendere manum' quod sit dominium potentiae, de qua n. 7673, 8183; 
ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum Divinum, de qua saepius; et ex significatione `maris,' hic `maris Suph,' quod sit infernum, de qua n. 8099, {1}8137, 8138.  Dominium potentiae veri Divini 
dicitur quia omnis potentia Divina est per verum quod a Domino procedit; hoc creavit omnia, secundum hoc apud Johannem, Omnia per Verbum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est,

in se omnem potentiam habet adeo ut sit ipsa potentia; sunt quidam in altera vita qui in vero sunt prae aliis; illi in tali potentia inde sunt ut (x)inferna absque ullo discrimine pervadere possint;

ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur {6}.  Qui ab externis et a terrestribus intuentur rerum causas non aliter possunt percipere quam quod verum a Divino sit modo cogitativum quid, nullius essentiae 
realis, sed est ipsissimum essentiale, ex quo sunt omnes essentiae rerum in utroque mundo, nempe spirituali et naturali. 	@1 8137, 8148 but possibly 8131, 9184 were intended.$ 	@2 verbo$ 	@3 ibi$ 	@4
