<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2580节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2580.</strong>“亚伯拉罕向神祷告”表启示。这从“祷告”的含义和“亚伯拉罕”的代表性清楚可知：“祷告”是指受到启示（参看<a href="2535.htm">2535</a>节）；“亚伯拉罕”代表主，这在前面已频繁说明。从字义上看，此处似乎有两个人，即祷告者和被祷告者，因为经上说“亚伯拉罕向神祷告”。但就内义而言，此处只有一个人，而非两个，因为作出启示的是主里面的神或耶和华，主从耶和华成孕。然而，主越具有构成来自母亲的人身之物，就越是另外一个人。内中情形对人来说很难落入观念以至于能理解。事实上，这些事能落入呈现在天堂之光里的天使观念中，却不怎么落入人的观念中，因为人的观念若不通过属于尘世之光的事物来说明，就理解不了。它们更不会落入那些在他们看来，属天堂之光的一切事物都是黑暗，以至于什么都不是之人的观念中。</p>

Abraham prayed unto God. That this signifies revelation, is evident from the signification of "praying" when predicated of the Lord, as being to be revealed (see n. 2535); and from the representation 
of Abraham, as being the Lord-often shown above. Here in the sense of the letter there are two, namely, one who prayed, and another to whom he prayed; for it is said, "Abraham prayed unto God." But in 
the internal sense there are not two, but one; for it was God or Jehovah in the Lord who made the revelation, because He was conceived of Jehovah; yet insofar as He had that which belonged to the maternal 
human, so far He was another. How the case is herein can with difficulty fall into the ideas so as to be understood. These things can indeed fall into angelic ideas, which are presented in the 
light of heaven; but not so well into human ideas, which do not perceive unless illuminated by things that are of the light of the world; still less can they fall into the ideas of those to whom everything 
that is of the light of heaven is thick darkness, so as to be nothing at all. </p>

'Abraham prayed to God' means a revelation. This is clear from the meaning of 'preying' when it has reference to the Lord, as a revelation being given, dealt with in <a href="2535.htm">2535</a>, and from the representation 
of 'Abraham' as the Lord, dealt with many times. In the sense of the letter two are portrayed - one who prayed, and another to whom he prayed, for it is said that 'Abraham prayed to God'. But in the 
internal sense there are not two but one, since it was God or Jehovah within Him - for He was conceived from Jehovah - who made the revelation. Yet insofar as that which constituted the maternal human 
existed with Him, He was someone other. It is scarcely possible however for an explanation of this to fall into ideas intelligible to man. It can indeed fall into angelic ideas, which are presented in 
the light of heaven, but it cannot fall so easily into human ideas, which do not perceive anything unless they are illuminated by the things which belong to the light of the world. Still less can such 
an explanation fall into the ideas of people for whom everything belonging to the light of heaven is thick darkness, so as to be nothing at all. </p>

`Oravit Abraham ad Deum': quod significet revelationem, constat a significatione `orare' cum praedicatur de Domino, quod sit revelari, de qua n. 2535; et a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, 
de qua pluries.  In sensu litterae sunt duo, nempe alius qui oravit et alius ad quem oravit, nam dicitur `oravit Abraham ad Deum at in sensu interno, non sunt duo sed unus, erat enim in Ipso Deus 
se Jehovah Qui revelavit, nam a Jehovah conceptus: sed quantum humani materni, tantum fuit alius: haec quomodo se habent, usque ad intellectum aegre cadere possunt in ideas, in angelicas quidem, quae 
sistuntur in luce caeli, non ita in humanas, quae nisi illuminatae a illis quae sunt lucis mundi, non percipiunt; minus adhuc in illorum quibus omne quod est lucis caeli, caligo est, ut sit nihil. </p>
