<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1729节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1729.</strong>“至高神”表内在人，也就是耶和华。这从有关主的内在人的数次论述清楚可知，主的内在人就是耶和华自己，因而主和耶和华父一样，如祂自己在约翰福音所说的：<br />我就是道路、真理、生命。腓力说，将父显给我们看。耶稣对他说，腓力，我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父，你怎么说将父显给我们看呢？我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />被称为“人子”的，正是主的人性本质，它经历试探的争战后也会与神性本质融合，以致人性本质也变成耶和华。因此，在天堂，他们只知道耶和华父是主（参看<a href="15.htm">15</a>节）。对主而言，一切都是耶和华，不仅祂的内在人和内层人，还有祂的外在人，包括肉体本身。所以，唯独祂带着肉身升入天堂，这一点清楚可见于福音书（那里描述了祂的复活），以及主自己的话：<br />你们为什么心里起疑念呢？你们看我的手，我的脚，就知道实在是我了。摸我看看！灵无骨无肉，你们看，我是有的。说了这话，就把手和脚给他们看。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.38.htm">24:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.40.htm">40</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1729.</strong> To God the Highest symbolizes his inner self, which was Jehovah. This can be seen from the statement made several times above that the Lord's inner self is Jehovah himself [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1475" target=_top>1475</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1573#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1573:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1602" target=_top>1602</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1707:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1725#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1725:2</a>] and accordingly that the Lord is identical with Jehovah the Father, as he himself says in John:<br />"I am the way and the truth and life." Philip says, "Show us the Father." Jesus says to him, "After all the time I've spent with you, don't you know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How then can you say, ‘Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me."

At the end of his struggles and trials it united with his divine nature, so that it too became Jehovah. In heaven, then, people recognize no other Jehovah the Father than the Lord (see above, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_15" target=_top>15</a>). Everything about the Lord is Jehovah — not only his inner self and intermediate but also his outer self and his actual body. As a result, he is the only one who has ever risen into heaven with a body as well. The Gospel writers make this abundantly clear when they talk about his resurrection.{*1} The words of the Lord himself do too:<br />"Why are thoughts rising in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet, because I am he. Feel me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have." And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.

To God Most High. That this signifies the internal man, which is Jehovah, is evident from what has been said already several times concerning the Lord's internal man, that it is Jehovah Himself, and 
thus that the Lord is the same as Jehovah the Father; as He Himself says in John: </p>
<p>     I am the way, and the truth, and the life. Philip saith, Show us the Father. Jesus saith unto him, Am I so long 
time with you, and dost thou not know Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? 
Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:6, 8-11). [2] It is the Lord's Human Essence which is called the "Son of man;" which also, after the combats of the temptations, was 
united to His Divine Essence, so that it was itself also made Jehovah; wherefore in heaven they know no other Jehovah the Father than the Lord (see above, n. 15). With the Lord all is Jehovah; not only 
His internal and His interior man, but also the external man, and the very body; and therefore He alone rose into heaven with the body also; as is sufficiently evident in the Gospels, where His resurrection 
is treated of; as also from the words of the Lord Himself: </p>
<p>     Wherefore do thoughts arise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see, for a spirit hath 
not flesh and bones as ye see Me have. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet (Luke 24:38-40). </p>

'To God Most High' means the Internal Man, which is Jehovah. This is clear from what has been stated several times above about the Lord's Internal Man being Jehovah Himself, so that the Lord is identical 
with Jehovah the Father, as He Himself says in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the way, and the truth, and the life. Philip said, Show us the Father. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you for so long, and yet you 
do not know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. So why do you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me that I am in the Father 
and the Father in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6,%208-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6, 8-11</a>.

 It is the Lord's Human Essence that is called the Son of Man. This too, after the conflicts brought about by temptations, was united to the Divine Essence, 
so that the Human Essence as well became Jehovah. In heaven therefore they know no other Father Jehovah but the Lord - see what has appeared already in <a href="15.htm">15</a>. With the Lord everything is Jehovah, 
not only His Internal Man and Interior Man, but also His External Man, including the body itself. He alone therefore has risen into heaven with the body as well, as is quite clear in the Gospels where 
His resurrection is described, and also from the Lord's own words, </p>
<blockquote>
Why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See My hands and My feet, for it is I Myself. Handle Me, and see, for a spirit does not have 
flesh and bones as you see Me have. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:38-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:38-40</a>.

'Deo Altissimo': quod significet Internum Hominem Qui Jehovah, constat ab illis quae supra aliquoties de Interno Homine Domini dicta sunt quod sit Ipse Jehovah; ita quod Dominus sit idem cum Jehovah 
Patre, sicut Ipse dicit apud Johannem, Ego sum via, et veritas, et vita;...dicit Philippus, Monstra nobis Patrem;...dicit ei Jesus, Tantum temporis vobiscum sum, non nosti Me, Philippe? qui vidit Me, 
vidit Patrem, quomodo ergo tu dicis, monstra nobis Patrem? nonne credis quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me? credite Mihi, quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me, xiv 6, 8-11. [2] Humana Domini Essentia est 
quae appellatur Filius Hominis, quae quoque post pugnas tentationum unita fuit Essentiae Divinae, ita ut Ipsa quoque facta sit Jehovah; quare in caelo non alium Jehovam Patrem norunt quam Dominum, 
vide prius n. 15. Apud Dominum est omne Jehovah, non solum Internus Ipsius Homo et Interior, se etiam Externus, ipsumque corpus, quare solus est Qui resurrexit in caelum etiam corpore, ut satis constat 
apud Evangelistas ubi de resurrectione Ipsius agitur; tum ab Ipsius Domini verbis, Quare cogitationes ascendunt in cordibus vestris? videte manus Meas et pedes Meos, quia Ipse Ego sum; palpate Me, 
et videte, nam spiritus carnem et ossa non habet, sicut Me videtis habere; hocque cum dixisset, ostendit illis manus et pedes, Luc. xxiv 38-40. </p>
