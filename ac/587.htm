<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第587节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>587.</strong>“耶和华就后悔造人在地上”表示怜悯，“心中忧伤”意思一样，只要想想耶和华自永恒预见一切，因此从不后悔，就能清楚知道这一点。当祂作成人，即再造他、完善他直到他成为属天时，祂也预见，随着时间推移他会变成此处所描述的这类人。正因为祂预见他会变成这类人，所以祂不可能后悔。这在撒母耳记中十分清楚：<br />撒母耳说，以色列的大能者必不至说谎，也不至后悔。因为他迥非世人，决不后悔。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下15.29.htm">15:29</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />神非人，必不致说谎；也非人子，必不致后悔。他说话岂不照着行呢？他发言岂不要成就呢？（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.19.htm">23:19</a>）<br />“后悔”表发怜悯。耶和华，即主的怜悯包括主对人类所做的一切事，人类处在主照各自状态怜悯他们的境地。因此，祂同情经祂允许受罚之人的状态，也同情被祂赋予良善享受的人。惩罚是怜悯的体现，因为怜悯将所罚的一切恶转向良善。赋予良善的享受也是怜悯的体现，因为人根本不配得任何善。事实上，整个人类都是邪恶的，若由着他们，人人都会奔向地狱。正是因着怜悯，人才从地狱获救，只是怜悯，没有别的，因为主无需人的帮助。之所以用怜悯一词，是因为怜悯将人从悲惨和地狱中解救出来；因此就人类而言，这就是所谓的怜悯，因为他们正处于悲惨的状态，这是爱所有人的果效，因为所有人都是如此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]587.</strong> The symbolism of Jehovah was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth and of he grieved at heart as mercy can be concluded from the fact that Jehovah never has regrets. After all, he foresees absolutely everything from eternity. When he made humankind — that is, when he created people anew and perfected them into heavenly people — he also foresaw that the race would gradually become what it did. Since he saw this ahead, he could not have changed his mind, as is plain in Samuel, who said:<br />The Undefeated One of Israel does not lie and will not be sorry, since he is not a human, that he should be sorry. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_587/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_15_29" target=_top>1 Samuel 15:29</a>)<br />And in Moses:<br />God is not a man and tells lies, or the offspring of humankind and has regrets. Has he said a thing and will not do it, or spoken and will not secure it? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_587/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_19" target=_top>Numbers 23:19</a>)<br />But regretting or feeling sorry symbolizes having mercy.<br />[2] Jehovah's mercy — the Lord's mercy — involves each and every thing the Lord does for the human race. Humankind's nature is such that the Lord has mercy on us, and on each of us according to our circumstances. So he has mercy on the state of one whom he permits to be punished and on the state of one to whom he grants good fortune. Punishment is an act of mercy because mercy bends all the evil involved in punishment to good ends. To grant good fortune is also an act of mercy because we never earn any kind of good. The whole human race is evil, and left to ourselves we all plunge into hell. To pull us back out of hell, then, is mercy, and pure mercy at that, since the Lord does not need anyone.<br />Mercy is called misericordia [in Latin] because it removes us from the miseries of hell.{*1} It is therefore named in relation to the human race, which is miserable, and is the effect of love for all people because they are miserable.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is drawing a connection between the root miser- in the Latin word for "mercy," misericordia, and the appearance of the same root in the Latin word for "miseries." The root relates to pity and wretchedness. (The second root in the word misericordia is cor, cord-, referring to "the heart.") [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 587</b></p><p><b>587.</b>
That it repented Jehovah that He made man on the earth signifies mercy, and that "He grieved at the heart" has a like signification, is evident from this, that Jehovah never repents, because He foresees 
all things from eternity both in general and in particular; and when He made man, that is, created him anew, and perfected him till he became celestial, He also foresaw that in process of time he 
would become such as is here described, and because He foresaw this He could not repent. This appears plainly from what Samuel said: </p>
<p>     The invincible one of Israel doth not lie, nor repent, for He 
is not a man that He should repent (1 Sam. 15:29). And in Moses: </p>
<p>     God is not a man that He should lie, or the son of man that He should repent; hath He said, and shall He not do? or hath He spoken, 
and shall He not make it good? (Num. 23:19). But to "repent" signifies to be merciful. The mercy of Jehovah, or of the Lord, includes everything that is done by the Lord toward mankind, who are 
in such a state that the Lord pities them, each one according to his state; thus He pities the state of him whom He permits to be punished, and pities him also to whom He grants the enjoyment of good; 
it is of mercy to be punished, because mercy turns all the evil of punishment into good; and it is of mercy to grant the enjoyment of good, because no one merits anything that is good; for all mankind 
are evil, and of himself everyone would rush into hell, wherefore it is of mercy that he is delivered thence; nor is it anything but mercy, inasmuch as He has need of no man. Mercy has its name from 
the fact that it delivers man from miseries* and from hell; thus it is called mercy in respect to mankind, because they are in such a state of misery, and it is the effect of love toward them all, because 
all are so. * The Latin word for mercy-misericordia-by its very construction expresses the idea of a heart that feels for the wretched. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 587</b></p><p><b>587.</b>
That 'Jehovah repented that He had made man on the earth' means mercy, and that 'He was grieved in heart' has a similar meaning, is clear from the consideration that Jehovah foresees from eternity every 
single thing and therefore never repents. When He made man, that is, created him anew and perfected him to the point of his becoming celestial, He also foresaw that in the process of time he would 
become the kind of person described here. And because He foresaw the kind of person he would become, He could not repent. This is quite clear in Samuel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Samuel said, The Invincible One of Israel 
does not lie, and He will not repent, for He is not a man (homo) that He should repent. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2015:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 15:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
God is not a man (vir), that He should lie, or a son of man, that He should repent. 
Has He said, and will He not act? Or has He spoken, and will He not carry it out? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Repenting' however means having mercy.  </p>

 Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's mercy includes every 
single thing which the Lord does towards the human race, whose condition is such that He has mercy on it, on each according to his state. He has mercy therefore on the state of the person He allows 
to be punished, as He does on that of the person on whom He confers the enjoyment of good. Being punished is a manifestation of mercy because it turns all evil that is being punished towards good. 
And conferring the enjoyment of good is a manifestation of mercy too, because nobody merits anything good at all. In fact the whole human race is evil, with everyone, if left to himself, rushing into 
hell. Consequently it is by mercy that anyone is rescued from that place, and by nothing other than mercy, since the Lord does not need anyone to help Him. The word mercy (misericordia) is used therefore 
because mercy rescues a person from misery (miseriae) and from hell, and so is used with respect to the human race whose condition is such, and it is the product of love towards all because all are such.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 587</b>
</p><b>587.</b>
Quod 'paenituit Jehovam, quod fecerit hominem in terra' significet misericordiam et quod 'doluerit ad cor' similiter, constat ex eo quod Jehovam nusquam paeniteat quia omnia et singula ab aeterno praevidet; 
et cum fecit hominem, hoc est, e novo creavit, et perfecit, usque ut factus caelestis, etiam praevidit quod talis successu temporis fieret; et quia praevidit quod talis fieret, non potuit Ipsum 
paenitere; quod manifeste constat apud Samuelem, 	Samuel dixit, Invictus Israelis non mentitur, et non 	Ipsum paenitebit, quia non homo Ille, ut Ipsum paeniteat, 1 Sam. xv 29: </p>
<p>et apud Mosen, 	Non 
vir Deus et mentitur; et filius hominis et paenitet ipsum; num Ille dixerit, et non faciet? aut locutus fuerit, et non stabiliet? Num. xxiii 19; </p>
<p>sed 'paenitere' significat misereri.  [2] Misericordia 
Jehovae seu Domini involvit omnia et singula quae a Domino fiunt erga genus humanum, quod tale est ut ejus misereatur, et cujusvis secundum ejus statum; ita miseretur status ejus quem puniri permittit; 
et miseretur ejus cui bono frui dat; misericordiae est puniri quia flectit omne malum poenae in bonum; et misericordiae est dare bono frui quia nullus aliquid boni meretur: omne enim genus humanum 
est malum et ex semet ad infernum unusquisque ruit; quare misericordia est ut inde eximatur; nec aliud est quam misericordia, quia nullius indiget. Misericordia inde dicitur quia a miseriis et inferno 
hominem eximit, ita respective ad genus humanum quod tale, estque effectus amoris erga omnes quia tales. </p>
