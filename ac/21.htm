<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第21节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>21.</strong>创世记1:4-5 神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了。神称光为“昼”，称暗为“夜”。<br />“光”被称为“善”（好），因为它出于主，而主是良善之本。“暗”，表人重新受生之前，一切看似光明之物。因为在此之前，恶看似为善，假看似为真，尽管它是黑暗，完全是人的我执。凡属于主的被比作“昼”，因为它属于光明；凡属于人的被比作“夜”，因为它属于黑暗。这种对比常在圣经中出现。</p>

And God saw the light, that it was good, and God made a distinction between light and darkness. And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night.<br />The light is said to be good because it is from the Lord, who is goodness itself.<br />The darkness is whatever looked like light to us before our new conception and birth, because we saw evil as good and falsity as truth; but it is actually darkness — our lingering sense of self-sufficiency.<br />Absolutely everything that is the Lord's is compared to the day, because it belongs to the light, and everything that is our own is compared to the night, because it belongs to the darkness.

Verses 4, 5. And God saw the light, that it was good, and God distinguished between the light and the darkness. And God called the light day, and the dark He called night. Light is called "good" because 
it is from the Lord, who is good itself, The "darkness" means all those things which, before man is conceived and born anew, have appeared like light, because evil has appeared like good, and the 
false like the true; yet they are darkness, consisting merely of the things proper to man himself, which still remain. Whatsoever is of the Lord is compared to "day" because it is of the light; and whatsoever 
is man's own is compared to "night" because it is of darkness. These comparisons frequently occur in the Word. </p>

Verses 4, 5 And God saw that the light was good; and God made a distinction between the light and the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.  </p>
<p>The light is called 
good, because it comes from the Lord, who is good itself. 'The darkness' is those things which were there prior to the person's new conception and birth. They were seen as light, because evil was seen 
as good, and falsity as truth. But in reality they are darkness and things proper to that person which are lingering on. All things that are the Lord's, being things of light, are compared to the day, 
and all that are man's own, being those of thick darkness, are compared to the night, as is done many times in the Word.  </p>

</p><b>21.</b>
Vers. 4, 5.  Et vidit Deus lucem, quod bona; et distinxit Deus inter lucem et inter tenebras. Et vocavit Deus lucem, diem; et tenebras vocavit noctem.  'Lux' dicitur bona, quia ex Domino, Qui est ipsum 
bonum: 'tenebrae' sunt quae antequam e novo concipitur et nascitur homo; apparuerunt sicut lux, quia malum sicut bonum, et falsum sicut verum, sed sunt tenebrae, suntque propria hominis quae manent. 
Omnia quaecumque Domini sunt, comparantur 'diei,' quia lucis sunt; et omnia quaecumque propria hominis, comparantur 'nocti,' quia caliginis: ita pluries in Verbo.
