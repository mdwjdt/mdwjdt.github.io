<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3742节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3742.</strong>只有一个独一无二的生命，它唯独来自主，并且天使、灵人和世人仅仅是生命的接受者。我通过大量经历得知这一真理，以至于丝毫没有怀疑的余地。天堂本身以直觉明白这些事是千真万确的，以致天使明显感知到这种流注，以及它如何流入的；同样感知到他们接受流注的程度和性质。其接受状态越完全，他们就越享有自己的平安和幸福；否则，就越处于不安、甚至某种焦虑的状态。然而，主的生命被如此归给他们，以至于使他们感觉他们凭自己活着，哪怕他们知道他们不是凭自己活着。主的生命归他们所有是出于主对全人类的爱和仁慈；因为主愿意将祂自己和祂所有的赐给每个人，并且在他们接受祂，也就是他们成为含有良善生命和真理生命在里面的主的样式和形像的限度内实实在在地赐给他们。由于这种神性努力不断从主发出，故如前所述，主的生命就变成他们自己的。</p>

That there is one only life, which is from the Lord alone, and that angels, spirits, and men are only recipients of life, has been made known to me by experience so manifold as to leave not even the 
slightest doubt. Heaven itself is in the perception that this is the case, insomuch that the angels manifestly perceive the influx, and also how it flows in; and likewise the fullness and quality of their 
reception of it. When they are in a fuller state of reception they are then in their peace and happiness; otherwise they are in a state of unrest and of a certain anxiety. Nevertheless the life of 
the Lord is so appropriated to them as to cause them to feel that they live from themselves, but yet they know that it is not from themselves. The appropriation of the Lord's life comes from His love 
and mercy toward the universal human race, in that He wills to give Himself to everyone, and all that is His, and in that He actually does give them insofar as they receive, that is to say, insofar 
as they are in the life of good and in the life of truth, as being likenesses and images of Him. And as such a Divine endeavor is continually proceeding from the Lord, as before said His life is appropriated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3742</b></p><p><b>3742.</b>
The truth that there is but one life alone and that this flows from the only Lord, and the truth that angels, spirits, and men are merely recipients of that life, I have been made to know from so much 
experience that not even the smallest shadow of doubt has remained. Heaven itself sees with perception that these things are so, insomuch that the angels have a clear perception of that life flowing 
in and also of the way in which it flows in, as well as a perception of the extent and the nature of their reception of it. When their state of reception is more complete they enjoy the peace and happiness 
that is theirs - otherwise their state is one of unrest and of some anxiety. But to so great an extent do they make the Lord's life their own that they perceive themselves to be living seemingly 
of themselves, even though they know that they do not live of themselves. They make the Lord's life their own because His love and mercy towards the entire human race desire it; that is to say, He wishes 
to impart Himself and what is His own to everyone, and in actual fact does so insofar as they are receptive of Him, that is, insofar as they are His likenesses and images in whom the life of good 
and the life of truth are present. And because such Divine endeavour proceeds from the Lord unceasingly, His life, as has been stated, is made their own. </p>

</p><b>3742.</b>
Quod vita unica sit, et illa a solo Domino, et quod angeli, spiritus et homines sint modo recipientes vitae, a tam multiplici experientia mihi notum factum est, ut ne quidem minimum dubium sit relictum; 
ipsum caelum in perceptione est quod ita sit, usque adeo ut angeli percipiant manifeste influxum, tum quoque quomodo influit, ut et quantum et qualiter recipiunt; cum in statu pleniore receptionis 
sunt, tunc in sua pace et felicitate sunt, alioquin in statu irrequiei et alicujus anxietatis; at usque appropriatur illis vita Domini, ita ut percipiant sicut vivant ex se, sed {1}tamen sciunt 
quod non ex se; appropriatio vitae Domini venit ex amore et misericordia Ipsius erga universum genus humanum, quod nempe unicuique dare velit Se et quod Suum est, et quod actualiter det quantum 
recipiunt, hoc est, quantum sicut Ipsius similitudines et imagines in vita boni et in vita veri sunt; et quia talis Divinus conatus {2}continue ex Domino est, vita Ipsius, {3}ut dictum, appropriatur. @1
