<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7969.</strong>出埃及记12:35，36.以色列人照着摩西的话行，向埃及人要银器金器和衣裳。耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼中蒙恩，以致埃及人借给他们。他们就掠夺了埃及人。<br />“以色列人照着摩西的话行”表他们顺从神的真理。“向埃及人要银器金器和衣裳”表包含真理和良善的记忆知识从属于教会的恶人那里被除去，要赐给属于教会的善人。“耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼中蒙恩”表那些受到诅咒的人对那些属于属灵教会之人的惧怕。“以致埃及人借给他们”表这些记忆知识被转移。“他们就掠夺了埃及人”表那些迷失在诅咒中的人完全失去这类事物。</p>

Verses 35, 36. And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the 
eyes of the Egyptians, and they lent to them; and they spoiled the Egyptians. "And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses," signifies that they obeyed truth Divine; "and they asked of 
the Egyptians vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments," signifies that the memory-knowledges of truth and good taken from the evil who had been of the church were to be bestowed upon the 
good who were from thence; "and Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians," signifies the fear of those who are damned on account of those who are of the spiritual church; "and they 
lent to them," signifies that they were transferred; "and they spoiled the Egyptians," signifies that they who were in damnation were altogether devastated of such things. </p>

<p>'And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses' means that they obeyed God's truth. 
'And they asked from the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and clothes' means that known facts containing truth and goodness were removed from the evil belonging to the Church, to 
be assigned to the good belonging to it. 'And Jehovah gave the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians' means fear which those who were damned had of those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'And 
they lent [these things] to them' means that those facts were transferred. 'And they despoiled the Egyptians' means that those lost in damnation were made completely devoid of such things.

Vers. 35, 36.  Et filii Israelis fecerunt secundum verbum Moschis, et petierunt ab Aegyptiis vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes.  Et Jehovah dedit gratiam populi in oculis Aegyptiorum, et commodaverunt 
illis, et eripuerunt Aegyptiis.  `Et filii Israelis fecerunt secundum verbum Moschis' significat quod oboedirent vero Divino: `et petierunt ab Aegyptiis vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes' significat 
scientifica veri et boni adempta malis qui ab Ecclesia, addicanda bonis qui inde: `et Jehovah dedit gratiam populi in oculis Aegyptiorum' significat timorem illorum qui damnati pro illis qui ab 
Ecclesia spirituali: `et commodaverunt illis' significat quod transferrentur: `et eripuerunt Aegyptiis' significat quod qui in damnatione a talibus prorsus devastati essent. </p>
