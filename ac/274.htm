<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第274节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>274.</strong>对于“吃田间的草本”表示像走兽一样生活，这从但以理书论尼布甲尼撒的话可知：“你必被赶出离开世人，与野地的兽同居，吃草如牛，且要经过七期。等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁就赐与谁。”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.25.htm">4:25</a>）<br />又如：“耶和华说，我早先所作的，古时所立的，就是现在藉你使坚固城荒废，变为乱堆，这事你岂没有听见吗？所以其中的居民力量甚小，惊惶羞愧。他们像田间的草，像青草，如房顶上的草，又如田间未长成的禾稼。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.26.htm">37:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.27.htm">27</a>）这里解释了“田间的草”、“青草”、“房顶的草”、“田间的禾稼”是何义，因为此处论述的是“早先”、“古时”所表示的洪水前的时代。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]274.</strong> The fact that eating the grass of the field, or fodder found in the wild, is living like an animal can be seen from Nebuchadnezzar's story in Daniel:<br />They will drive you away from humanity, and your dwelling place will be with the beast of the field. They will make you eat grass like cattle, and seven seasons will pass over you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_274/bible_king-james-version_daniel_4_32" target=_top>Daniel 4:32</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />Have you not heard? From far away I did this, from the days of old, and I formed it. Now I have caused it to come, and it will be for tearing down bulwarks, fortified cities, into heaps. And their residents, their hand shortened, have felt panic and shame. They have become field grass, and green grass, the grain plant on the roofs,{*1} and a plowed field burnt out in front of the standing crop. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_274/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_37_26-27" target=_top>Isaiah 37:26-27</a>)<br />This explains what field grass and what green grass, the grain plant on the roofs, and a plowed field burnt out mean. It is referring to the time before the Flood, as implied by the words far off and days of old.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "The grain plant on the roofs" is the growth that arose from seeds mixed into the mud of which roofs were commonly made in Middle Eastern countries. Though it grew rapidly with the rains, it either dried up quickly in the ensuing sun or was burned off before it could attain its usual height. See International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (Orr 1960), under "grass;" compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_274/bible_king-james-version_psalms_129_6" target=_top>Psalms 129:6</a>.

That to "eat the herb of the field" (that is, wild food) denotes to live like a wild animal, is evident from what is said of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel: </p>
<p>     They shall drive thee from man, and thy dwelling 
shall be with the beast of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee (Dan 4:25). And in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Hast thou not heard how I have done it long 
ago, and from the days of old have I formed it; now have I brought it to pass, and it shall be to lay waste bulwarks, fenced cities, in heaps; and their inhabitants, short of hand, were dismayed and 
put to shame; they were made the grass of the field, and the green [olus] of the herb, the grass of the housetops, and a field parched before [coram] the standing corn (Isa. 37:26-27). Here it is explained 
what is signified by the "grass of the field" the "green of the herb" the "grass on the housetops" and a "field parched;" for the subject here treated of is the time before the flood, which is 
meant by "long ago" and the "days of old." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 274</b></p><p><b>274.</b>
'Eating the plant of the field', or fodder that is wild, is to live like a wild animal. This is clear in Daniel in reference to Nebuchadnezzar,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will drive you away from human beings, and your 
dwelling will be with the beast of the field; you will be made to eat the plants like oxen; and seven times will pass over you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%204:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 4:32</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Have you not heard that I did it long 
ago and planned it from days of old? Now I have brought it to pass, and it will be that strongholds, fortified cities, will be devastated into heaps; and their inhabitants, shorn of power', were dismayed 
and filled with shame; they became plants of the field and edible plants, grass on rooftops, and scorched earth before standing corn. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:26, 27</a>.   
</blockquote>
This makes explicit what 'plants of the 
field' means, and what 'edible plants, grass on rooftops, and scorched earth' means, for the subject here is the time before the Flood, which is what 'long ago' and 'days of old' are used to mean.

Quod 'edere herbam agri,' seu pabulum agreste, sit vivere ut fera, constat apud Danielem ubi de Nebuchadnezzare, 	Ab homine expellent te, et cum bestia agri habitatio tua, herbam, sicut boves, te edere 
facient, et septem tempora transibunt super te, iv 29 [A.V. 32]: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, 	Annon audivisti, ad e longinquo id feci, a diebus antiquitatis, et formavi id? nunc adduxi id, et erit ad devastandum 
in acervos propugnacula, urbes munitas; et habitatores eorum, breves manu, consternati sunt, et pudore affecti, facti sunt herba agri, et olus herbae, tamen tectorum, et arvum adustum coram segete
