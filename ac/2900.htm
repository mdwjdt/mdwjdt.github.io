In regard to the Word of the New Testament which is in the Evangelists, as the Lord spoke from the Divine itself, the several things spoken by Him were representative and significative of Divine things, 
thus of the heavenly things of His kingdom and church, as has been abundantly shown above.            GENESIS 23 </p>
<p>     1. And the lives of Sarah were a hundred years and twenty years and seven 
years, the years of the lives of Sarah.      2. And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba, the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.      3. And Abraham 
rose up from upon the faces of his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,       4. I am a sojourner and a dweller with you; give me a possession of a sepulcher with you, and I will bury my 
dead from before me.      5. And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,      6. Hear us, my lord, thou art a prince of God in the midst of us; in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy 
dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, from burying thy dead.      7. And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth.      8. And he spoke with 
them, saying, If it is with your soul that I should bury my dead from before me, hear me, and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zohar.      9. That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which 
he hath, which is in the end of his field; in full silver let him give it to me, in the midst of you, for a possession of a sepulcher.      10. And Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth; 
and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,       11. Nay, my lord, hear me; the field give I thee, and the cave 
that is therein I give it thee; to the eyes of the sons of my people give I it thee; bury thy dead.      12. And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.      13. And he spoke unto Ephron 
in the ears of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me; I will give the silver of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.      14. And Ephron answered 
Abraham, saying unto him,       15. My lord, hear me; land of four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.      16. And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; 
and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver current with the merchant.      17. And the field of Ephron, which was 
in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was therein, and every tree that was in the field, that was in all the border thereof round about, were made sure,       18. Unto Abraham 
for an acquisition to the eyes of the sons of Heth, of all that went in at the gate of his city.      19. And after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife, in the cave of the field of Machpelah, upon 
the faces of Mamre, the same is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.      20. And the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a sepulcher from the sons of Heth. </p>

As regards the New Testament Word found in the Evangelists, since the Lord spoke this from the Divine itself, all the particular things that He said were representatives and meaningful signs of Divine 
things, and so of the heavenly things of His kingdom and Church, as has been shown many times in what has gone before. </p>

Quod Verbum Novi Testamenti quod apud Evangelistas, attinet, quia Dominus ex ipso Divino locutus est, ideo quoque singula quae locutus, repraesentativa et significativa Divinorum, ita caelestium regni 
et Ecclesiae Ipsius, fuerunt, ut pluries in praecedentibus ostensum. </p>
<p>                              CAPUT XXIII      1.  Et fuerunt vitae Sarae, centum anni et viginti anni et septem anni, anni 
vitarum Sarae.      2.  Et mortua est Sarah in Kiriath Arba, haec Hebron in terra Canaan; et venit Abraham ad lugendum Saram, et ad deflendum illam.      3.  Et surrexit Abraham desuper faciebus mortui 
sui, et locutus est ad filios Heth, dicendo.      4.  Peregrinus et incola ego vobiscum, date mihi possessionem sepulcri vobiscum, et sepeliam mortuum meum a coram me.      5.  Et responderunt filii 
Heth Abrahamo, dicendo ei.      6.  Audi nos, domine mi, princeps DEI tu in medio nostri, in electo sepulcrorum nostrorum sepeli mortuum tuum, quisquam e nobis sepulcrum suum non prohibebit a te, 
a sepeliendo mortuum tuum.      7.  Et surrexit Abraham et incurvavit se populo terrae, filiis Heth.      8.  Et locutus cum illis dicendo, Si est cum anima vestra ad sepeliendum mortuum meum a coram 
me, audite me, et intercedite mihi apud Ephronem filium Zohar.      9.  Et det mihi speluncam Machpelae, quae illi, quae in fine agri ejus; in argento pleno det illam mihi in medio vestri, ad possessionem 
sepulcri.      10.  Et Ephron sedens in medio filiorum Heth, et respondit Ephron Hittaeus Abrahamo, in auribus filiorum Heth, omnibus intrantibus portam urbis ejus, dicendo,       11.  Non, 
domine mi, audi me, agrum do tibi, et speluncam quae in illo tibi do illam, ad oculos filiorum populi mei do illam tibi, sepeli mortuum tuum.      12.  Et incurvavit se Abraham coram populo terrae.  
    13.  Et locutus ad Ephronem in auribus populi terrae, dicendo, Verumtamen si tu, placet, audias me, dabo argentum agri, accipe a me, et sepeliam mortuum meum ibi.      14.  Et respondit Ephron 
Abrahamo, dicendo ei,      15.  Domine mi, audi me, terra quadringentorum siclorum argenti, inter me et inter te quid hoc? et mortuum tuum sepeli.      16.  Et audivit Abraham ad Ephronem, et appendit 
Abraham Ephroni argentum, quod locutus in auribus filiorum Heth, quadringentos siclos argenti, transeuntis mercatori.      17.  Et constitit ager Ephronis, qui in Machpelah, quae coram Mamre, ager 
et spelunca quae in illo, et omnis arbor quae in agro, quae in omni termino ejus circumcirca,      18.  Abrahamo in acquisitionem, ad oculos filiorum Heth, in omnium intrantium portam urbis ejus.  
    19.  Et post ita, sepelivit Abraham Saram uxorem suam, ad speluncam agri Machpelae super faciebus Mamre, haec Hebron in terra Canaan.      20.  Et constitit ager et spelunca quae in illo, Abrahamo 
ad possessionem sepulcri, ex filiis Heth. </p>
