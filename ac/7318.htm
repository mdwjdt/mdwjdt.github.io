<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7318节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7318.</strong>“河里的鱼必死”表真理的记忆知识将被毁。这从“鱼”和“死”的含义清楚可知：“鱼”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="991.htm">991</a>节），在此是指真理的记忆知识，由于鱼所在的水变作了血，故经上说它必死，以此表示这种知识将通过虚假而被毁；“死”是指被毁。举几个例子说明何为对真理的歪曲。当人们基于错误的推理断定并宣称，由于没有人能凭自己行善，所以良善丝毫无助于救恩时，真理就被歪曲了。当他们宣称，凡人所行的良善皆关注自我，是为了回报而行的，既然如此，那么仁爱的作为无需去行时，真理也被歪曲了。当人们宣称，由于一切良善皆源于主，所以人不可行任何善事，而是要等待流注或灵感时，真理就被歪曲了。当他们宣称，没有仁之良善的真理，因而没有仁的信，也能存在于一个人里面时，真理就被歪曲了。当人们宣称，除了困苦穷乏的人外，没有人能进入天堂时，以及当人们宣称，除非将自己所有的都给穷人，让自己陷入悲惨的境地，否则，没有人能进入天堂时，真理就被歪曲了。<br />当人们宣称，人人都能凭怜悯或恩典被允许进入天堂，无论他过着怎样的生活时，真理就被歪曲了。当他们宣称，某人已被赋予权柄，可以准许凡他所选中的人进入天堂时，真理更是被歪曲了。当人们宣称，罪被完全洁净并冲走了，就像污垢被冲洗干净一样时，真理就被称歪曲了。当他们宣称，某人有赦罪的权柄，并且这些罪被赦免的时候，它们就完全洁净了，这个人就纯洁了时，真理更是被歪曲了。当人们宣称，主将一切罪都担在自己身上，从而承受了一切罪，人由此而能得救，无论他过着怎样的生活时，真理就被歪曲了。当他们宣称，除教会里的人外，没有人得救时，真理就被歪曲了。用来实现这种歪曲的推理就包含在这种观点中：那些在教会里的人已经受洗，拥有圣言，知道主、复活、永生、天堂和地狱，从而知道那使他们能称义的信是什么。像这样的推理不计其数，因为没有一个真理不能被歪曲，也没有不能通过基于幻觉的推理来确证的歪曲。</p>

And the fish that is in the river shall die. That this signifies that the memory-knowledge of truth shall be extinguished, is evident from the signification of "the fish," as being memory-knowledge (see 
n. 40, 991), here the memory-knowledge of truth, because it is said that it should die, because in waters turned into blood, by which is signified that it would be extinguished through falsification; 
and from the signification of "dying," as being to be extinguished. What the falsification of truth is shall be illustrated by some examples. Truth is falsified when from reasonings it is concluded 
and said that because no one can do what is good from himself, therefore good effects nothing toward salvation. Truth is also falsified when it is said that all the good which a man does regards himself 
and is done for the sake of recompense, and this being so, works of charity are not to be done. Truth is falsified when it is said that because all good is from the Lord, therefore man ought to do 
nothing of good, but should await influx. Truth is falsified when it said that truth can exist in a man without the good which is of charity, thus faith without charity. Truth is falsified when it is 
said that no one can enter into heaven except one who is miserable and poor; also when it is said, unless he gives all he has to the poor, and reduces himself to miseries.  [2] Truth is falsified when 
it is said that everyone can be admitted into heaven from mercy, no matter how he has lived. Truth is still more falsified when it is said that there has been given to man the power of admitting into 
heaven whomsoever he pleases. Truth is falsified when it is said that sins are wiped and washed away like filth by water; and truth is still more falsified when it is said that man has the power of 
remitting sins, and that when they have been remitted, they are altogether wiped away, and the man is pure. Truth is falsified when it is said that the Lord has taken all sins upon Himself, and so has 
taken them away, and that thus man can be saved, no matter what his life is. Truth is falsified when it is said that no one is saved except one who is within the church. The reasonings by which such 
falsification is effected, are that they who are within the church have been baptized, have the Word, know about the Lord, about the resurrection, life eternal, heaven, and hell, and thus they know 
what the faith is by which they can be justified. There are countless such things as these, for there is not a single truth which cannot be falsified, and the falsification confirmed by reasonings from 
fallacies. </p>

'And the fish that are in the river will die' means that factual knowledge of truth will be destroyed. This is clear from the meaning of 'fish' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="40.htm">40</a>, <a href="991.htm">991</a>, at this point 
factual knowledge of truth since it says that the fish are going to die because the water they are in has been turned into blood, meaning that such knowledge will be destroyed through falsification; 
and from the meaning of 'dying' as being destroyed. A number of examples will show what the falsification of truth is. Truth is falsified when on the basis of false reasonings people deduce and declare 
that because no one can do good all by himself good contributes nothing to salvation. Truth is also falsified when they declare that whatever good a person does has self in view and is done for the 
sake of reward, and this being so, that the works of charity do not need to be performed. Truth is falsified when people declare that because all good has its origin in the Lord a person should not 
perform anything good at all but should wait for inspiration. Truth is falsified when they declare that truth can exist with a person without the good of charity, thus faith without charity. Truth is 
falsified when people declare that nobody can enter heaven except him who is wretched and poor, and also when they declare that no one can enter unless he gives all his goods to the poor and reduces 
himself to a state of wretchedness. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Truth is falsified when people declare that everyone, irrespective of the kind of life he has been leading, can by mercy be admitted into heaven. Truth is falsified 
further still when they declare that someone has been given the power to admit whomever he chooses into heaven. Truth is falsified when people declare that sins are altogether purged, and washed 
away like dirt by water. And truth is falsified further still when they declare that somebody has the power to forgive sins, and that when they have been forgiven those sins are altogether purged, 
making the person pure. Truth is falsified when people declare that the Lord has taken onto Himself and so bears all sins, so that a person can be saved no matter what kind of life he leads. Truth is 
falsified when they declare that no one is saved except him who is within the Church. The reasonings by means of which falsification is effected are contained in the notion that those who are within the 
Church have been baptized, possess the Word, know about the Lord, resurrection, eternal life, heaven, and hell, and accordingly know what the faith that enables them to be justified is. Reasonings 
like these are countless, for not one single truth exists that is incapable of being falsified, and there is no falsification that cannot be substantiated by means of reasonings based on illusions. </p>

`Piscis qui in fluvio morietur': quod significet quod scientificum veri exstinguetur, constat ex significatione `piscis' quod sit scientificum, de qua n. 40, 991, hic scientificum veri, quia dicitur 
quod moriturus, quoniam in aquis versis in sanguinem, per quae significatur quod exstinguetur per falsificationem; et ex significatione `mori' quod sit exstingui.  Quid sit falsificatio veri, per aliquot 
exempla illustrabitur: (s)falsificatur verum cum ex ratiociniis concluditur, et dicitur quod, quia nemo bonum potest facere a se, ideo bonum nihil faciat ad salutem: falsificatur etiam verum cum 
dicitur quod omne bonum quod homo facit spectet ipsum et fiat remunerationis causa, et quia ita, quod opera charitatis {1}non facienda: falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod, quia omne bonum a Domino, homo 
nihil boni {2}facere debeat, sed exspectet influxum: falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod verum apud hominem absque bono quod charitatis possit dari, ita fides absque charitate: falsificatur verum 
cum dicitur quod intrare in caelum nemo possit nisi qui miser sit et pauper; etiam cum dicitur nisi quis det omnia sua pauperibus, et se in miserias redigat: falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod {3}quisque, 
qualitercumque 2 {4}vixerat, intromitti queat in caelum ex misericordia: adhuc magis falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod {5} homini data sit potestas intromittendi quoslibet in caelum: falsificatur 
verum cum dicitur quod peccata abstergantur, et abluantur sicut sordes ab aquis: et (t)adhuc magis falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod homini sit potestas (t)remittendi peccata, et {6}cum remissa 
sunt, quod prorsus abstersa sint et homo sit purus: falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod Dominus in Se derivaverit omnia peccata, et sic illa sustulerit, et sic quod homo salvari possit qualiscumque ei 
vita sit: falsificatur verum cum dicitur quod nemo salvetur nisi qui intra Ecclesiam est; ratiocinia per quae falsificatio sunt quod qui intra Ecclesiam, baptizati sint, habeant Verbum, sciant de Domino, 
de resurrectione, de vita aeterna, de caelo, et de inferno, {7}ac ita quod sciant quid fides, per quam justificari possunt.  His similia sunt innumera, nam ne quidem unicum verum datur quod non falsificari 
potest, et falsificatio per ratiocinia ex fallaciis confirmari.(s) 	@1 nihil efficiant$ 	@2 agere debeat ut a se$ 	@3 intromissio in coelum$ 	@4 vixerat homo, sit solius misericordiae$ 	@5 
i data$ 	@6 quod tunc peccata$ 	@7 et quod justificari possint per fidem, et quod nulla salvatio ubi non fides, et nulla fides ubi non cognitio de Domino, et do fide in Ipso$ </p>
