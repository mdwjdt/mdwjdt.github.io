<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1865节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1865.</strong>“说，我已将这片地赐给你的种”表这些试探及其恐怖后的安慰，大意是，凡拥有仁并信祂之人将成为祂的后嗣。这从“种”和“地”的含义清楚可知。“亚伯兰的种”表爱和源于爱的信，这在前面已说明（<a href="255.htm">255</a>，<a href="256.htm">256</a>，<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>节），因而表拥有仁并信祂的所有人。但“迦南地”表主的国度，故“将这片地赐给你的种”表天国将作为产业被赐给那些出于仁而信祂之人。<br />这些事就是主经历试探及其恐怖后带给祂的安慰，这是显而易见的，无需解释。因为祂目睹这些冷酷的事件，也就是祂击溃恶与假（也就是11节所描述的“鸷鸟下来落在这些尸体上，亚伯兰就把它们赶走了”所表示的）之后，所有浓密的虚假仍进入祂里面，祂对此不寒而栗（也就是12节所描述的落到沉睡的亚伯兰身上“可怕的大黑暗”所表示的）。这一切连同以下事实，即最终纯粹的恶与假占据人类（也就是17节所描述的从那些肉块经过的“冒烟的炉”和“烧着的火把”所表示的），不可避免地令祂悲痛。故随后就有了诸如4节和5节所给予的安慰，即祂的种必得这地为业，也就是说，那些拥有仁并信祂之人必成为主国度的后嗣。对主而言，人类的救赎是唯一的安慰，因为祂受神性和属天之爱驱动，甚至就其人性本质而言，就是那神性和属天之爱本身。这爱唯独关注并心怀对所有人的爱，神性之爱就具有这种性质，这一点从父母对子女的爱可以看出来。这爱会随着它延续的程度而增长，也就是说，这爱对更遥远的后代比对直系子女更大。任何事物若没有原因和起源，就不会存在。因此，在人类里面并代代增长的这种对后代的爱，也不可能离开它们而存在。这爱的原因和起源唯独来自主，一切婚姻之爱和舔犊之爱都从祂流入。这爱的源头就是祂的爱，而祂的爱具有这样的性质，即祂象父亲爱自己的儿子那样爱所有人，渴望让所有人成为祂的后嗣，并为那些将要出生的人提供产业，如同为那些已出生的人所做的那样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1865.</strong> Saying, "To your seed will I give this land," symbolizes the consolation, after all these trials and horrors, that the people who possessed charity and faith in him would become his heirs, as is established by the symbolism of seed and that of the land. Abram's seed symbolizes love and the faith that comes of it, as shown before, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_256" target=_top>256</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025" target=_top>1025</a>. So it symbolizes everyone who has charity and faith in the Lord. The land of Canaan symbolizes the Lord's kingdom. Giving your seed the land, then, means that the heavenly kingdom would be given as an inheritance to people who have a faith in the Lord that comes from charity.<br />[2] No explanation is needed to show that these things served to console the Lord after his trials and horrors. After all, he put evil and falsity to flight (symbolized by Abram's driving away of the winged creatures that swooped down onto the bodies, as told in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_11" target=_top>11</a>). Yet thick falsity was going to pour in, and this horrified him (symbolized by the terror of immense shadows that fell on Abram in his sleep, as told in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_12" target=_top>12</a>). Furthermore, undiluted falsity and evil would take over the human race in the end (symbolized by the smoky furnace and fiery torch that passed between the pieces, as told in the last verse, verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_17" target=_top>17</a>). After foreseeing these distressing outcomes, he could not help feeling anguish and grief. A message of comfort now follows, therefore, like the one in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1865/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_4-5" target=_top>4-5</a> above saying that his seed would inherit the land — that is, people who have charity and faith in him would become heirs of his kingdom. The salvation of the human race was his only comfort, because he possessed divine, heavenly love and became divine, heavenly love itself even in regard to his human nature. Only this love aims to love everyone and finds heartfelt satisfaction in doing so.<br />[3] The fact that divine love is like this can be illustrated by the love parents have for their children, which grows with each generation. In other words, parents have more love for their later descendants than for their own direct offspring. Nothing ever exists without a cause and source, so neither does this constantly increasing love the human race has for ensuing generations. The cause and source have to lie with the Lord, from whom flows all love between married partners and all the love parents have for their children. The reason lies in the nature of the Lord's love. He loves us all as a father loves his children, wants to make us all his heirs, and provides an inheritance for those who have yet to be born, just as he does for those already born. </p>

Saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. That this signifies the consolation after these temptations and horrors, in that they who are in charity and faith in Him should become heirs, is evident 
from the signification of "seed," and from the signification of the "land." By the "seed of Abram" are signified love and the faith derived therefrom, as has been shown before (n. 255, 256, 1025), consequently 
all those who are in charity and in faith in the Lord. But by the land of Canaan is signified the Lord's kingdom; therefore to "give the land unto thy seed" signifies that the heavenly kingdom 
should be given as an inheritance to those who from charity have faith in Him.  [2] That these things were a consolation to the Lord after His temptations and horrors, may be seen without explication. 
For after those hard and adverse eventualities which the Lord had seen, that is to say, after he had put to flight evils and falsities-which were signified by the fowls that came down upon the bodies 
and that Abram drove away (mentioned in verse 11)-and yet after all dense falsities infused themselves, at which He shuddered (which were signified by the "terror of great darkness" that fell upon 
Abram in the deep sleep, spoken of in verse 12), and yet at last mere falsities and evils took possession of the human race (which are signified by "the furnace of smoke" and "the torch of fire" which 
passed between the pieces, mentioned in verse 17, that precedes this), the Lord could not but be in distress and grief; and therefore consolation now follows, such as was given above (verses 4 and 
5); namely, that His seed should inherit the land, that is, that they who are in charity and in faith in Him should become heirs of His kingdom. To Him the salvation of the human race was the only consolation, 
for He was in Divine and celestial love, and became, even as to His Human Essence, the Divine and celestial Love itself, in which the love of all is alone regarded and is at heart. [3] That 
the Divine love is such may be seen from the love of parents toward their children, which increases according to the degree in which it descends, that is, it becomes greater toward the more remote descendants 
than it is toward the immediate children. Nothing ever exists without a cause and an origin, consequently neither does this love in the human race that is characterized by a constant increase 
toward the descendants in succession. The cause and origin of this cannot but be from the Lord, from whom inflows all conjugial love, and that of parents toward their children, and the source of which 
is that His love for all is like that of a father for his sons, who desires to make all His heirs, and provides an inheritance for those who are to be born, as He does for those already born. </p>

'Saying, To your seed I will give this land' means the comfort experienced after these temptations and their horrors, to the effect that people who have charity and faith in Him will become His heirs. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' and from the meaning of 'land'. 'The seed of Abram' means love and faith that flows from love, as shown already in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, and consequently all who have 
charity and faith in the Lord. 'The land of Canaan' however means the Lord's kingdom, and therefore 'giving the land to your seed' means that the heavenly kingdom would be given as an inheritance 
to those who from charity have faith in Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That these things brought comfort to the Lord following temptations and their horrors becomes clear without explanation. For after those grim events 
which He had witnessed - that is to say, after He had put to flight the evils and falsities meant by 'the birds of prey that came down on the carcasses and that Abram drove away', described in verse 11 - gross falsities nevertheless entered into Him, such as horrified Him, meant by 'the dread of a great darkness which came over Abram in a deep sleep', described in verse 12. This, together with the 
fact that in the end sheer falsities and evils took possession of the human race - meant by 'the smoking furnace and flaming torch which passed' between the pieces', referred to in verse 17 - inevitably 
caused Him distress and grief. Comfort therefore follows now, like that in verses 4 and <a href="5.htm">5</a> above, namely that His seed will inherit the land, that is, those who have charity and faith in Him will 
become heirs of His kingdom. The salvation of the human race was for Him the only comfort, for He was moved by Divine and celestial love and became, even as regards the Human Essence, that Divine and 
celestial love, in which solely the love for all is countenanced and entertained. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That such is the nature of Divine love becomes clear from the love of parents towards their children, in that it 
increases with every descending degree of affinity, that is, it becomes greater towards later descendants than towards immediate offspring. Nothing ever exists without a cause or origin, and therefore 
this love towards descendants, present in the human race and ever increasing with each successive generation, cannot exist without them. The cause and origin of that love are attributable solely to 
the Lord, from whom all conjugial love and love of parents towards children flow. The source of that love is His love, which is such that He loves all as a father loves his sons, and wishes to make all 
his heirs, and provides an inheritance for those yet to be born, as he does for those born already. </p>

'Dicendo, Semini tuo dabo terram hanc': quod significet consolationem post tentationes has et horrores, quod illi qui in charitate et fide in Ipsum heredes fient, constat a significatione 'seminis' 
et a significatione 'terrae'; per 'semen Abrami' significatur amor et inde fides, quod ostensum prius n. 255, 256, 1025, proinde omnes illi qui in charitate et fide in Dominum sunt; per 'terram Canaan' 
autem significatur regnum Domini, quare 'dare terram semini tuo' significat quod regnum caeleste daretur in hereditatem illis qui ex charitate fidem in Ipsum habent; [2] quod haec consolationi fuerint 
Domino post tentationes et horrores, constare potest absque explicatione; nam post eventus illos duros qui visi, nempe postquam profugavit mala et falsa quae significata sunt per 'volatile quod descendit 
super corpora, quod abegit Abram,' de quo vers. 11, et usque densae falsitates se infunderent quas horruit, quae significatae sunt per 'terrorem tenebrarum magnarum, qui cecidit in sopore super 
Abramum,' de quo vers. 12; et tamen denique mera falsa et mala occuparent genus humanum, quae significata sunt per 'furnum fumi, et facem ignis, quae transivit inter segmenta,' de quibus vers. praec. 
17, non potuit aliter quam in angustia et dolore esse; quare nunc consolatio sequitur qualis supra vers. 4 et 5, quod nempe 'semen Ipsius hereditabit terram,' hoc est, qui in charitate et fide in Ipsum 
quod heredes fient regni Ipsius; salvatio generis humani sola Ipsi consolatio fuit, nam in Amore Divino et caelesti fuit, et factus est, etiam (x)quoad Humanam Essentiam, ipse Amor Divinus et caelestis, 
in quo unice amor omnium spectatur et cordi est.  [3] Quod Amor Divinus talis sit, constare potest ex amore parentum erga liberos, quod crescat secundum gradum quo descendit, hoc est, major fiat 
in posteris quam in ipsis liberis proximis; nihil usquam datur absque causa et origine, proinde nec amor hic erga posteros successive cum continuis incrementis apud humanum genus; causa et origo non 
potest alia esse quam a Domino, a Quo omnis amor conjugialis et parentum erga liberos influit, ex eo quod Ipsius amor talis sit ut omnes sicut Pater filios amet, et omnes heredes facere velit et hereditatem 
prospiciat illis qui nascendi, sicut illis qui nati sunt. </p>
