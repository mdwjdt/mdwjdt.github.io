<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2658节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2658.</strong>“因为这使女的儿子不可与我的儿子以撒一同继承产业”表无论就真理而言，还是就良善而言，纯人类理性都不能拥有和神圣理性本身一样的生命。这从“继承产业”、“使女的儿子”和“我的儿子以撒”的含义清楚可知：“继承产业”是指拥有另一种生命（稍后会解释）；“使女的儿子”是指纯人类理性的真理与良善（参看<a href="2657.htm">2657</a>节）；“我的儿子以撒”是指神圣理性，其真理由“我的儿子”来表示，其良善由“以撒”来表示（参看<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节）。“以撒”是指神圣理性的良善，这一点从“笑”的含义明显可知，以撒因笑得名，“笑”是指对真理的情感，或从真理流出的良善，这在6，7节有所说明（参看<a href="2640.htm">2640</a>，<a href="2641.htm">2641</a>，<a href="2643.htm">2643</a>节）。由此明显可知，“这使女的儿子不可与我的儿子以撒一同继承产业” 表无论就真理而言，还是就良善而言，纯人类理性都不能拥有和神圣理性一样的生命。纯人类理性不能拥有同样的生命，这单从以下事实就能明显看出来：神性是生命本身，因而里面拥有生命；而纯人类理性只不过是生命的器官，因而里面没有生命。<br />当主的人性变成神性时，这人性就不再是生命的器官，或生命的接受者，而是生命本身，就是诸如耶和华自己的生命。它从一开始，也就是自耶和华成孕时就拥有这生命，这从主自己在约翰福音中所说的话很明显地看出来：<br />因为父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给儿子也照样在自己有生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">5:26</a>）<br />神圣人性是此处所说的“儿子”（<a href="1729.htm">1729</a>，<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>节）。同一福音书：<br />生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">1:4</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，我就是道路、真理、生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，我就是复活，就是生命，信我的人，虽然死了，也必活着。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">11:25</a>）<br /><br />神的粮，就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世界的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.33.htm">6:33</a>）<br />但人并非生命，而是生命的器官，或生命的接受者（参看<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>节等）。综上所述，明显可知，当主的人身变成耶和华时，本身非生命之物，即纯粹的人性就被逐出了。这就是经上说“这使女的儿子不可与儿子以撒一同继承产业”这句话的意思。<br />当论及主时，“继承或承受产业”的内义是指拥有父的生命，因而是指在自己有生命；当论及人时，“继承或承受产业”是指拥有主的生命，即从主接受生命。这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。在自己有生命就是生命的存在本身，即耶和华；而拥有主的生命，或从主接受生命是指接受对主的爱和信；由于这种人在主里面，是主的，故他们被称为主的“继承（或承受）者”和“儿子”。<br />在旧约圣言中，“继承或承受产业”（inheritance）既论及属天之物或良善，也论及属灵之物或真理，尽管属天之物用这个词来表述，属灵之物用那个词来表述。论及良善的这个词可表示为“通过继承或承受而拥有” （possess by inheritance）；论及真理的这个词可表示为“继承或承受”（inherit）。在原文，前一词还暗含“拥有”的意味；而后一个词则暗含从这种拥有而来的衍生物的意味；这就是属灵的相对于属天的，或真理相对于良善的情形。在本节，“以撒”代表主的神圣理性或神圣人性，故经上采用了表示“通过正当继承或承受而拥有”的一个词，因为主的神圣人性是唯一的继承（或承受）和拥有者，如祂以比喻所教导的那样（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.33.htm">21:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.38.htm">38</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.7.htm">12:7</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.14.htm">20:14</a>）；祂在数处声明，凡父所有的都是祂的。<br />在圣言中，当论及人时，“通过继承或承受而拥有”和“继承”表从主接受生命，因而表接受永生或天堂（因为唯独接受主生命的人才能接受天堂）。这一点明显可见于启示录：<br />得胜的，必承受这一切福分。我要作他的神，他要作我的儿子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.7.htm">21:7</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />凡为我的名撇下房屋或是弟兄、姐妹的，必要得着百倍，并且承受永生。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.29.htm">19:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.17.htm">10:17</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.18.htm">18:18</a>）<br />此处天堂被称为“永生”，在别处只简单地被称为“生命”（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.8.htm">18:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.17.htm">19:17</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">3:36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.24.htm">5:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.29.htm">29</a>）。因为主就是生命本身，凡接受主生命的，都在天堂。<br />诗篇：<br />神要拯救锡安，建造犹大的城邑。他们要在那里居住，得以为业。他仆人的种要承受它为业。爱祂名的人也要住在其中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.35.htm">69:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.36.htm">36</a>）<br />此处，“得以为业”（possess by inheritance）论及那些具有属天之爱的人，“承受”（inherit）论及那些具有属灵之爱的人。以赛亚书：<br />但信靠我的却必承受这地，拥有我的圣山为业。 （以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.13.htm">57:13</a>）<br />同样在摩西书：<br />我举手起誓应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地，我要把你们领进去，将那地赐给你们为产业。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.8.htm">6:8</a>）<br />从字面上看，这些话表示迦南地要赐给他们为产业，事实上也的确赐给他们了。但就内义而言，这些话表示天堂要赐给那些爱主、信主之人。因为“亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各”代表主，故表示爱本身和信本身，随之表示那些有爱和信之人，因而表示那些在主里面的人。这些人也由亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，以及与他们在天堂同坐席的许多人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.11.htm">8:11</a>）来表示；因为在天堂，人们根本不知道亚伯拉罕、以撒或雅各是谁，只知道他们所代表和表示之物；“与他们同坐席”也一样。圣言中所提及的一切名字都表示真实事物（<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节），迦南地表天上的迦南，或天堂（<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>节），它被简单地称为“地”（<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="2571.htm">2571</a>节）。在马太福音也是如此：<br />温柔的人有福了，因为他们必承受地土。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.5.htm">5:5</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2658</b></p><p><b>2658.</b>
For the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac. That this signifies that the merely human rational could not have a life in common with the Divine rational itself, either as to 
good or as to truth, is evident from the signification of "inheriting," as being to have another's life (to be explained presently); from the signification of the "son of the handmaid," as being the 
merely human rational as to truth and as to good (see n. 2657); from the signification of "my son Isaac," as being the Divine rational as to truth (which is "my son"), and as to good (which is "Isaac"), 
concerning which see n. 2623, 2630. That "Isaac" is the Divine rational as to good, is evident from the signification of "laughter," from which he was named, as being the affection of truth, or the 
good of truth, in the sixth and seventh verses (2640, 2641, 2643). Hence it is manifest that "the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac," denotes that the merely human rational 
cannot have a life in common with the Divine rational, either as to truth or as to good. That it cannot have a life in common, is evident from the mere fact that the Divine is Life itself, and thus 
has life in Itself; whereas the merely human is an organ of life, and thus has not life in itself. [2] When the Lord's Human was made Divine it was no longer an organ of life, or a recipient of life, 
but was Life itself, such as is that of Jehovah Himself. It had this at first from its very conception from Jehovah, as is clearly manifest from the Lord's own words in John: </p>
<p>     As the Father hath 
life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:26); </p>
<p>the Divine Human is what is here called the "Son" (n. 1729, 2159, 2628). In the same: </p>
<p>     In Him was life, and 
the life was the light of men (John 1:4). In the same: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). In the same: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life, he that 
believeth in Me, though he die, yet shall he live (John 11:25). In the same: </p>
<p>     The bread of God is He that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world (John 6:33). But that man is not 
life, but an organ or recipient of life, may be seen above (n. 2021, and occasionally elsewhere). From all this it is evident that when the Lord was made Jehovah even as to His Human, that which was 
not life in itself, that is, that which was merely human, was banished. This is signified by its being said that the son of the handmaid could not inherit with the son Isaac. [3] That to "inherit," 
in the internal sense, when predicated of the Lord, is to have the Father's life, thus to have life in Himself; and when predicated of men, it is to have the Lord's life, that is, to receive life from 
the Lord, is evident from many passages in the Word. To have life in Himself is the Esse itself of life, that is, Jehovah; whereas to have the Lord's life, or to receive life from the Lord, is to receive 
the Lord in love and faith; and as those who so receive Him are in the Lord, and are the Lord's, they are called His "heirs," and His "sons."  [4] In the Word of the Old Testament "inheriting" 
is predicated not only of what is celestial, or of good, but also of what is spiritual, or of truth, but still the one is expressed by a different word from the other: the word that is predicated of good 
may be rendered "to possess by inheritance;" and the word that is predicated of truth, "to inherit." The former word also in the original language involves possession, but the latter, derivation from 
something else, as is the case with the spiritual in relation to the celestial, or with truth in relation to good. In this verse, where the Lord's Divine rational, or His Divine Human, is represented 
by Isaac, the word denoting possession by hereditary right is used, because the Lord's Divine Human is the sole heir-possessor, as He also teaches in the parable (Matt. 21:33, 37, 38; Mark 12:7; Luke 
20:14); and He declares in several places that all things of the Father are His.  [5] That to "possess by inheritance" and to "inherit," in the Word, when predicated of men, signify to receive life 
from the Lord, consequently eternal life or heaven (for they alone receive heaven who receive the Lord's life), is evident in John: </p>
<p>     He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be 
his God, and he shall be My son (Rev. 21:7). In Matthew: </p>
<p>     Everyone that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life 
(Matt. 19:29; 25:34; Mark 10:17; Luke 18:18). Here heaven is called "eternal life," elsewhere simply "life" (as in Matt. 18:8-9; 19:17; John 3:36; 5:24, 29), for the reason that the Lord is Life itself, 
and he who receives His life is in heaven. [6] In David: </p>
<p>     God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah, and they shall dwell there, and possess it by inheritance, the seed also of His 
servants shall inherit it, and they that love His name shall dwell therein (Ps. 69:35-36); </p>
<p>where to "possess by inheritance" is predicated of those who are in celestial love, and to "inherit" of those 
who are in spiritual love. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He that putteth his trust in Me shall inherit the land, and shall possess by inheritance the mountain of My holiness (Isa. 57:13). [7] In like manner in 
Moses: </p>
<p>     I will bring you unto the land concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you for an hereditary possession (Exod. 6:8). In 
the sense of the letter these words signify that the land of Canaan should be given to them for an hereditary possession, which also was done; but in the internal sense they signify that heaven should 
be given to those who are in love to the Lord and faith in Him; for as the Lord is represented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so love itself and faith itself are signified, consequently those who are 
in love and faith, and thus those who are in the Lord. The same are also signified by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with whom many shall sit down in the kingdom of the heavens, as we read in Matthew 8:11; 
for in heaven Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not known at all; but it is only known what is represented and signified by them, as also what is signified by sitting down or eating with them. For that 
all names in the Word signify actual things may be seen above (n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888); also that the "land of Canaan" is the heavenly Canaan or heaven (n. 1585, 1607, 1866), which is called simply 
the "land" (n. 1413, 1607, 1733, 2571). So too in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth (Matt. 5:5). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2658</b></p><p><b>2658.</b>
'For the son of this servant-girl shall not inherit together with my son, with Isaac' means that the merely human rational could not possess the same life as the Divine Rational itself, neither as to 
truth nor as to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'inheriting' as possessing the life of another, to be dealt with immediately below; from the meaning of 'the son of a servant-girl' as the merely 
human rational as to truth and as to good, dealt with in <a href="2657.htm">2657</a>; and from the meaning of 'my son, Isaac' as the Divine Rational as to truth, meant by 'my son', and as to good, meant by 'Isaac', dealt 
with in <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>. That 'Isaac' is the Divine Rational as to good is clear from verses 6, 7 (in <a href="2640.htm">2640</a>, <a href="2641.htm">2641</a>, <a href="2643.htm">2643</a>) - from the meaning of 'laughter', from which he was named, as the affection for truth, 
or good that flows from truth. From this it is evident that 'the son of this servant-girl shall not inherit together with my son, with Isaac' means that the merely human rational cannot possess the 
same life as the Divine Rational, neither as to truth nor as to good. Its inability to possess the same life is clear from the single consideration that the Divine is life itself, and this being so possesses 
life within Itself, whereas the merely human is only an organ for life and that being so does not possess life in itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Once it had become Divine the Lord's Human was no longer an organ 
or recipient of life; it was now Life itself, the same as that of Jehovah Himself. It had this life at the start from its very conception from Jehovah, as is plainly evident from the Lord's own words 
in John, </p>
<blockquote>
As the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:-26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Divine Human is what is called 'the Son', <a href="1729.htm">1729</a>, <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>. In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>

<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, I am the 
resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, though he die, will live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2011:-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 11:-25</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>Man however is not life but an organ or recipient of it, see <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, and in various places elsewhere. From this it may be evident that when the Lord was made Jehovah even as to the Human, 
that which was not life in itself, that is, the merely human, was banished. This is the meaning of the statement that the son of a servant-girl could not inherit together with the son Isaac. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
When 'inheriting' in the internal sense has reference to the Lord it means possessing the Father's life, and so possessing life within Himself; and when it has reference to men it means possessing 
the Lord's life, that is, receiving life from the Lord. This is clear from many places in the Word. Possessing life in Himself is the very Being (Esse) of life, which is Jehovah, whereas possessing the 
Lord's life, or receiving life from the Lord, is accepting the Lord in love and faith. And because such persons abide in the Lord and are the Lord's they are called His heirs and sons. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the 
Old Testament Word 'inheritance' is used to refer both to what is celestial, or good, and to what is spiritual, or truth, though what is celestial is expressed by one word, what is spiritual by another. 
The first word may be rendered as 'possessing by inheritance', but the second as 'inheriting'. In the original language the first word also implies possession, but the second a derivation from such 
possession, in the way that celestial and spiritual are related to each other, or good and truth are related. In the present verse, where 'Isaac' represents the Lord's Divine Rational or Divine Human, 
the word describing possession by right of inheritance is used, for the Lord's Divine Human is sole heir and possessor, as He also teaches in the parable recorded in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:%2033,%2037,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21: 33, 37, 38</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12: 7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2020:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 20: 14</a>; and in various places declares that all that is the Father's is His. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 When 'possessing by inheritance' and 'inheriting' in the Word have reference to men, they mean receiving life 
from the Lord, and therefore receiving eternal life or heaven, for only those who receive the Lord's life receive heaven. This is clear in John, </p>
<p>He who overcomes will receive all things by inheritance, 
and I will be his God and he will be My Son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21: 7</a>. </p>
<p>In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters for My name's sake will receive a hundredfold and will be allotted 
the inheritance of eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:%2029;%2025:%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19: 29; 25: 43</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10: 17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here heaven is called 'eternal life', elsewhere simply 'life', as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:%208,%209;%2019:%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18: 8, 9; 19: 17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:%2036;%205:%2024,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3: 36; 5: 24, 29</a>, 
the reason being that the Lord is life itself, and anyone who receives His life is in heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>God will save Zion and will build the cities of Judah; and they will dwell there and 
possess it by inheritance; and the seed of His servants will inherit it, and those loving His name will dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:%2035,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69: 35, 36</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'possessing by inheritance' has reference to those in whom 
celestial love exists, 'inheriting' to those in whom spiritual love exists. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He who trusts in Me will inherit the land, and will possess by inheritance My holy mountain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
the meaning is similar.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Moses, </p>

<p>In the sense of the letter these words mean that the land of Canaan was to be granted to them as a hereditary possession, which did in fact happen. But in the internal sense they mean 
that heaven was to be granted to those in whom love to and faith in the Lord were present, for as the Lord is represented by 'Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob' so are love itself and faith itself meant by 
them, and consequently people in whom love and faith are present, and who accordingly abide in the Lord. These are also meant by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with whom many will recline at table in the 
kingdom of heaven, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%208:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 8: 11</a>; for those who are in heaven are completely unaware of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, and know only of what is represented and meant by them. And the same goes for 'reclining 
at table (or eating) with them'. For all names mentioned in the Word mean real things, see <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, and the land of Canaan means the heavenly Canaan or heaven, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, which

</p><b>2658.</b>
`Quia non hereditabit filius ancillae hujus cum filio me cum Jishako': quod significet quod rationale mere humanum cum Rationali ipso Divino non posset communem vitam habere, neque quo: verum neque 
quoad bonum, constat a significatione `hereditare' quod sit habere vitam alterius, de qua mox; ex significatione `filii ancilla quod sit rationale mere humanum quoad verum et quoad bonum de qua n. 2657; 
et ex significatione `filii mei, Jishaki' quod sit Rationali Divinum quoad verum, quod est `filius meus,' et quoad bonum, quod est `Jishakus,' de qua n. 2623, 2630; quod `Jishakus' sit Rationale Divinum 
quoad bonum, ex significatione `risus,' ex quo nominatus, quod sit affectio veri seu bonum veri, constat a vers. 6, 7, n. 2640, 2641, 2643; inde patet quod `non hereditabit filius ancillae hujus 
cum filio meo, cum Jishako' sit quod rationale mere humanum cum Rationali Divino non possit communem vitam habere neque quoad verum neque' quoad bonum: quod communem vitam habere nequeat, constat ex 
eo solo quod Divinum sit ipsa vita, et sic habeat vitam in Se Ipso; mere humanum autem est organum vitae, et sic non habet vitam in seipso; [2] Humanum Domini cum Divinum factum, non amplius fuit organum 
vitae seu recipiens vitae, sed fuit ipsa vita, qualis Ipsius Jehovae; e ipsa conceptione a Jehovah hoc primum habuit, quod clare ab Ipsius Domini verbis patet, apud Johannem, 	Quemadmodum Pater habet 
vitam in Se Ipso, ita dedit Filio habere vitam in Seipso, v 26; </p>
<p>Divinum Humanum est quod vocatur `Filius,' n. 1729, 2159, 2628: apud eundem, 	In Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum, I 4: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Dixit Jesus, Ego sum via, veritas, et vita, xiv 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Jesus dixit, Ego sum resurrectio et vita, qui credit in Me, etsi moriatur, vivet, xi 25: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Panis Dei est, 
qui descendit e caelo, et vitam dat mundo, vi 33; </p>
<p>quod autem homo non sit vita, sed organum seu recipiens vitae, videatur n. 2021, et alibi passim; exinde evidens esse potest quod cum Dominus etiam 
quoad Humanum Jehovah factus, illud quod non vita erat in se, hoc est, quod mere humanum, ablegaretur; hoc significatur per quod `illius ancillae non hereditare posset cum filio Jishako.'  [3] Quod `hereditare' 
in sensu interno, cum praedicatur de Domino, sit vitam habere Patris, ita in Se Ipso, et cum praedicatur de hominibus, quod sit vitam habere Domini, hoc est, vitam accipere a Domino, constat 
a pluribus locis Verbi; vitam habere in Se Ipso est ipsum Esse vitae, hoc est, Jehovah; vitam autem habere Domini, seu vitam accipere a Domino, est recipere Dominum amore et fide, et quia illi sunt 
in Domino et sunt Domini, vocantur `heredes et filii Ipsius.'  [4] In Verbo Veteris Testamenti praedicatur `hereditas' tam de caelesti seu bono, quam de spirituali seu vero, sed usque unum exprimitur 
alia voce quam alterum; illam vocem interpretari licet per `possidere hereditario,' hanc autem per `hereditare'; illa etiam vox in lingua originali involvit possessionem, haec autem derivationem inde, 
sicut se habet caeleste ad spirituale, seu bonum ad verum; in hoc versu, ubi per `Jishakum' repraesentatur Divinum Rationale seu Divinum Humanum Domini, est vox possessionis ex jure hereditario, quia 
Domini Divinum Humanum est solus possessor heres, ut quoque Ipse docet in parabola, Matth. xxi 33, 37, 38; Marc. xii 7; Luc. xx 14, et passim declarat quod `omnia Patris, Ipsius sint.'  [5] Quod `hereditario 
possidere' et `hereditare' in Verbo, cum praedicatur de hominibus, significet vitam accipere a Domino, proinde vitam aeternam seu caelum {1}, nam illi soli caelum accipiunt qui vitam Domini 
recipiunt, constat {2} apud Johannem, 	Qui vicerit, hereditario accipiet omnia, et ero illi Deus, et ille erit Mihi filius, Apoc. xxi 7: </p>
<p>apud Matthaeum, 	Omnis qui reliquerit domos, aut fratres, aut 
sorores,... propter nomen Meum, centuplum accipiet, et vitae 	aeternae sortietur hereditatem, xix 29; xxv 34; Marc. x 17; 	Luc. xviii 18; </p>
<p>hic caelum vocatur vita aeterna, alibi simpliciter vita, ut 
Matth. xviii 8, 9; xix 17; Joh. iii 36; v 24, 29, ex causa quia Dominus est ipsa vita, et qui Ipsius vitam accipit, is est in caelo: [6] apud Davidem, 	Deus salvabit Zionem, et aedificabit civitates 
Jehudae, habitabunt ibi, et possidebunt hereditario eam, et semen servorum Ipsius hereditabunt eam, et amantes nomen Ipsius habitabunt in ea, Ps. lxix 36, 37 [A.V. 35, 36]; </p>
<p>ubi `possidere hereditario' 
praedicatur de iis qui in amore caelesti sunt, `hereditare' de iis qui in amore spirituali: [7] apud Esaiam, 	Confidens in Me hereditabit terram, et possidebit hereditario montem sanctitatis Meae, 
lvii 13; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Mosen, 	Deducam vos ad terram, super qua levavi manum Meam, ad dandum eam Abrahamo, Isaco, et Jacobo, et dabo eam in {3} possessionem hereditariam, Exod. vi 8; </p>
<p>haec in sensu 
litterae significant quod terra Canaan daretur iis possessionem hereditariam, quod etiam factum; at in sensu interno significant quod daretur caelum illis qui in amore et fide in Dominum sunt; nam 
sicut Dominus per `Abrahamum, Isacum, et Jacobum' repraesentatur, ita significatur ipse amor et ipsa fides, proinde illi qui in amore et fide sunt, ita qui in Domino: ut quoque per `Abrahamum, Isacum, 
et Jacobum cum quibus multi accumbent in regno caelorum apud Matthaeum viii 11; in caelo enim prorsus ignoratur Abraham, Isac et Jacob, sed solum scitur quid per eos repraesentatur significatur, similiter 
ac quid per `accumbere seu comedere cum iis'; quod enim omnia nomina in Verbo significent res, videatur n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, et quod `terra Canaan' sit Canaan caelestis seu caelum, n. 1585, 
1607, 1866, quod etiam simpliciter vocatur `terra', n. 1413, 1607, 1733, 2571, sicut etiam apud Matthaeum, 	Beati miseri, quia ii hereditatem accipient terrae, v 5. 	@1 i accipere.$ 	@2 patet.$ 	@3 
i vobis.$ </p>
