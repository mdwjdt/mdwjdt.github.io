<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1059节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1059.</strong>“这是立约的记号，是我在我与地上一切有血肉的之间所立的”表这是主在仁爱中不仅与教会成员同在，还与教会外的人同在的标志。这一点从“一切有血肉的”的含义清楚可知，它表所有人，因而表整个人类。由于表整个人类，所以既表教会之内的人，也表教会之外的人。这一点不仅从采用“一切有血肉的”的表述清楚可知，还从没有采用之前出现的“凡有血肉的活的灵魂”这一表述清楚可知。加上“地上”使这一点变得更明显。<br />主同样在仁爱中与那些教会外、被称为外邦人的人同在，如同与教会内的人同在那样（对此，可参看<a href="932.htm">932</a>，<a href="1032.htm">1032</a>节）。事实上，祂更与他们同在，因为比起一般的所谓基督徒，其心智的觉知部分没有那么大的云。外邦人不知道圣言，也不知道何为主，因而不知道何为信之真理。所以，他们无法反对主，也无法反对信之真理。因此，他们的“云”并不站在主和信之真理的对立面；当他们受到启示时，这种云很容易被驱散。<br />但是，基督徒的云站在主和信之真理的对立面，这云如此昏暗，几近于黑。当仇恨取代仁爱时，这云就是浓厚的黑暗。那些亵渎信之真理之人的云甚至更黑，而外邦人无法亵渎，因为他们活在对信之真理的无知中。没人能亵渎他不知道其性质或存在之物。这就解释了为何得救的外邦人多于基督徒的原因，如主所说的（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.23.htm">13:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.28.htm">28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.30.htm">30</a>），此外祂还说，他们的孩子全都属于主的国（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.10.htm">18:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.14.htm">19:14</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.16.htm">18:16</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1059.</strong> This is the sign of the pact that I am setting up between me and all flesh that is on the earth means that not only would people in the church have an indication that the Lord was present in charity but people outside the church would too. This meaning is visible from the symbolism of all flesh as every individual and consequently as the whole human race. The fact that it is the whole human race, both the portion inside the church and the portion outside it, can be seen not only from the mention of all flesh but also from the fact that the earlier phrase the living soul within all flesh is not repeated. The addition of the words that is on the earth makes it even clearer.<br />[2] The Lord is just as much present in charity among those who are outside the church, called Gentiles, as among those who are inside the church. (See what was said above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_932" target=_top>932</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1032" target=_top>1032</a>.) In fact he is more closely present, because they have less cloud in their intellectual part than so-called Christians usually do. Non-Christians are ignorant of the Word and do not know who the Lord is, so they do not know the truth that the faith teaches. As a result they themselves cannot oppose the Lord or that truth, and therefore their clouds do not oppose the Lord or that truth. Clouds of this kind can be dispelled easily when such people are enlightened.<br />[3] Christians, though, are capable of having clouds that do block the Lord and the truth of the faith, and these clouds are dark enough to produce gloom. When hatred replaces neighborly love, pitch blackness results. The effect is intensified in those who profane the truth of the faith, which non-Christians cannot do, since they live in ignorance of that truth. None of us can profane a thing whose nature and existence we are unaware of.<br />This is why more non-Christians than Christians are saved, as the Lord also said in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_luke_13_23" target=_top>Luke 13:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_luke_13_28-29" target=_top>28-29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_luke_13_30" target=_top>30</a>. In addition, he said that all their little children belong to the Lord's kingdom, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_matthew_18_10" target=_top>Matthew 18:10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_matthew_18_14" target=_top>14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_matthew_19_14" target=_top>19:14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1059/bible_king-james-version_luke_18_16" target=_top>Luke 18:16</a>.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Strictly speaking, in none of the cited verses does Jesus identify the children in question as belonging to any particular religious group, but this argument from silence does support the point Swedenborg is making: that all children, even those of non-Christians, enter heaven.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1059</b></p><p><b>1059.</b>
This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth. That this signifies that the indication of the Lord's presence in charity was not only with 
the man of the church, but also with the man outside the church, is evident from the signification of "all flesh" as being every man, and consequently the whole human race. That the whole human race is 
meant, both within the church and without the church, is evident not only from its being said "all flesh" but also from its not being said as before, "every living soul of all flesh;" and this is made 
still plainer from its being added, "that is upon the earth." That with those who are outside the church, and are called Gentiles, the Lord is equally present in charity as with those who are within 
the church, you may see stated above (n. 932, 1032). He is even more present, for there is not so great a cloud in their intellectual part as there is in general with those who are called Christians. 
For the Gentiles are ignorant of the Word, nor do they know what the Lord is, consequently not what the truth of faith is; and therefore they cannot be against the Lord and against the truth of faith. 
Hence their "cloud" is not against the Lord and the truth of faith; and such a cloud may be easily dispersed when they are enlightened. But the cloud of Christians is against the Lord and against the 
truths of faith, and this cloud is so dense as to be darkness. And when there is hatred in place of charity, then it is thick darkness. Still darker is it with those who profane the truths of faith, 
which the Gentiles cannot do because they live in ignorance of the truth of faith. No one can profane that of which he does not know the nature or the existence. This is why more of the Gentiles are 
saved than of Christians, in accordance with what the Lord also said in Luke (13:23, 28-30), besides that their children all belong to the Lord's kingdom (Matt. 18:10, 14; 19:14; Luke 18:16). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1059</b></p><p><b>1059.</b>
'This is the sign of the covenant that I am establishing between Me and all flesh that is on the earth' means that it was a token of the Lord's presence in charity not only with the member of the Church 
but also with him who is outside the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'all flesh' as all people, and therefore the whole human race. That the whole human race is meant, both those inside 
the Church and those outside the Church, is clear not only from the fact that the expression 'all flesh' is used but also that the expression 'living soul in all flesh', which appeared previously, is 
not used. And the point is made plainer still by the addition of the phrase 'which is on the earth'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
That the Lord is as much present in charity with those outside the Church who are called gentiles 
as with those inside the Church may be seen above in <a href="932.htm">932</a>, <a href="1032.htm">1032</a>. Indeed He is more present with them, for the reason that there is less cloud in the understanding part of their minds than is normally 
the case with so-called Christians. Indeed gentiles have no knowledge of the Word and do not know what the Lord is, and as a consequence do not know what the truth of faith is. This being so, they 
are incapable of opposition to the Lord and to the truth of faith. Consequently their cloud does not stand in opposition to the Lord or to the truth of faith, such cloud being dispersed easily when they 
are enlightened. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But the cloud existing with Christians does stand in opposition to the Lord and to the truths of faith, and this cloud is so obscure as to be darkness. And when hatred is there 
instead of charity it is thick darkness. This applies even more to people who profane the truths of faith, something gentiles are incapable of doing because they live in ignorance of the truth of 
faith. Nobody can profane that of which he does not know the nature or the existence. This explains why more of the gentiles are saved than of Christians, as also the Lord said, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:23,%2028-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:23, 28-30</a>, 
in addition to saying that their children all belong to the Lord's kingdom, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:10,%2014;%2019:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:10, 14; 19:14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:16</a>. </p>

</p><b>1059.</b>
Quod 'hoc signum foederis quod Ego erigo inter Me, e inter omnem carnem, quae super terra' significet quod indicium praesentiae Domini in charitate non solum esset apud hominem Ecclesiae sed etiam apud 
hominem extra Ecclesiam, constat significatione 'omnis carnis,' quod sit omnis homo, proinde universum genus humanum; quod sit universum genus humanum, tam quod intra Ecclesiam quam quod extra Ecclesiam, 
constat non solum ex eo quod dicatur 'omnis caro' sed etiam quod non dicatur, ut prius, 'anima viva in omni carne'; manifestius etiam redditur per illud quod adjiciatur 'quae super terra.'  [2] 
Quod Dominus apud illos qui extra Ecclesiam, et gentes vocantur, aeque in charitate praesens sit ac apud illos qui intra Ecclesiam, supra dictum videas n. 932, 1032, immo praesentior; causa est quod 
tanta nubes in parte eorum intellectuali non sit quanta in communi apud ita vocatos Christianos; gentes enim ignorant Verbum nec sciunt quid Dominus, proinde non sciunt quid verum fidei, quare non possunt 
esse contra Dominum et contra verum fidei; inde nubes eorum non est contra Dominum et contra verum fidei; talis nubes facile potest discuti cum illustrantur: [3] at Christianorum nubes datur contra 
Dominum et contra vera fidei, quae nubes ita obscura est ut sint tenebrae; et cum odium est loco charitatis, tunc est caliginosum; adhuc magis apud eos qui profanant vera fidei, quod gentes facere 
non possunt quia in ignorantia veri fidei vivunt; nemo profanare potest quod ignorat quale est et quod sit: haec causa est quod plures ex gentibus salventur quam ex Christianis; quod etiam Dominus dixit 
apud Luc. xiii 23, 28-30, praeter quod infantes eorum omnes sint regni Domini, Matth. xviii 10, 14; xix 14; Luc. xviii 16. </p>
