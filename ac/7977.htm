<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7977节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7977.</strong>“并有羊群、牛群，就是他们所得大量财物”表通过真理所获得的极大丰富的良善，包括内层的和外层的。这从“羊群”和“牛群”的含义清楚可知：“羊群”是指内层良善；“牛群”是指外层良善（参看<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>，<a href="5913.htm">5913</a>，<a href="6048.htm">6048</a>，<a href="7960.htm">7960</a>节）。“财物”表示它们是获得的，与那些属于属灵教会的人同在的一切良善都是通过真理获得的，因为没有信之真理，他们不知道何为属灵真理，也不知道何为属灵良善。他们的确能知道世俗真理和道德真理，以及伴随这些真理的良善，因为它们与世界上的事物是一致的，这些事物也赋予他们对这些真理和良善的一种觉知。但属灵真理及其良善与世界上的那些事物并不一致，在许多情况下甚至与它们格格不入，这就是为何那些属于属灵教会的人必须接受关于它们的教导。说这些事是为了叫人们知道，与那些属于属灵教会的人同在的一切良善都必须通过真理获得。“大量”表示极大丰富。这是显而易见的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7977</b></p><p><b>7977.</b>
And flock, and herd, a very great acquisition. That this signifies the good acquired by means of truth, interior and exterior, in great abundance, is evident from the signification of "flock," as being 
interior good, and from the signification of "herd," as being exterior good (see n. 2566, 5913, 6048, 7960). That it was acquired is signified by "acquisition," for with those who are of the spiritual 
church all good is acquired by means of truth, because without the truth which is of faith they do not know what spiritual truth is, nor what spiritual good is. They are indeed capable of knowing 
civil truth, also moral truth, and their goods, because they are concordant with things which are in the world, whence also they have a perception of these truths and goods. But spiritual truth and its 
good are not concordant with those things which are in the world, and in many cases are even quite at variance with them, and therefore those of the spiritual church have to be instructed about them. 
These things have been said to show that with those who are of the spiritual church all good must be acquired by means of truth. That "very great" denotes great abundance, is evident. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7977</b></p><p><b>7977.</b>
'And flocks and herds, an extremely large acquisition of them' means good acquired through truth, interior and exterior, a great abundance of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'flock' as interior 
good, and from the meaning of 'herd' as exterior good, both of which are dealt with in <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, <a href="5913.htm">5913</a>, <a href="6048.htm">6048</a>, <a href="7960.htm">7960</a>, their having been acquired being meant by 'an acquisition'. All the good present with those 
belonging to the spiritual Church has been acquired through truth; for without the truth of faith they do not know what spiritual truth is or what spiritual good is. They may certainly be acquainted 
with civic truth, and with the good that accompanies civic truth and moral truth, since all these are compatible with worldly interests, interests that give them their perception of such truth and 
good. But spiritual truth and the good that accompanies it are not compatible with worldly interests; indeed in a large number of instances they are completely divergent from them, which is why those 
people have to receive instruction about them. These matters have been stated to make it known that all good with those belonging to the spiritual Church has to be acquired through truth. The fact that 
'extremely large' means a great abundance is self-evident. </p>

`Et grex et armentum acquisitio gravis valde': quod significet bonum acquisitum per verum, interius et exterius, copia multa, constat ex significatione `gregis' quod sit bonum interius, et ex significatione 
`armenti' quod sit bonum exterius, de quibus n. 2566, 5913, 6048, 7960; quod acquisitum sit, significatur per `acquisitionem'; omne enim bonum apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt acquisitum 
est per verum; nam absque vero quod fidei non sciunt quid verum spirituale nec quid bonum spirituale; verum quidem civile, tum verum morale, et eorum bona, scire possunt quia haec sunt congrua {1}rebus 
quae in mundo, inde quoque illorum perceptionem habent; at verum spirituale et bonum ejus non illis quae in mundo congrua sunt, immo in pluribus prorsus ab illis {2}abeunt, quare de illis instruendi 
sunt.  Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quod omne bonum apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt acquirendum sit per verum; quod `gravis valde' sit copia multa, patet. 	@1 illis$ 	@2 dissentiunt$ </p>
