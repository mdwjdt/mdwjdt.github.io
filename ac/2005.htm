<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2005节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2005.</strong>“父”表它必来自主自己。这从刚才所论述的“父”的含义清楚可知，即：凡来自父的也来自主，因为他们原为一。每个人的内在都来自他的父亲，外在则来自他的母亲；或也可说，灵魂本身来自父亲，包裹灵魂的肉体来自母亲。肉体与灵魂尽管为二，却合为一体。因为灵魂是肉体的，肉体是灵魂的，所以它们是不可分割的。主的内在来自父，故是父自己。正因如此，主说“父在祂里面”，还说“我在父里面，父在我里面”，又说“人看见了我，就看见了父”，以及“我与父原为一”，如从上述经文所看到的。在旧约，主也被称为“父”。如以赛亚书：<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上。祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）<br />谁都能清楚看出，为我们而生、赐给我们的“婴孩”就是主，祂名称为“永恒的父”。同一先知书：<br />亚伯拉罕虽然不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们，你却是我们的父。耶和华啊，你是我们的父；从万古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.16.htm">63:16</a>）<br />此处主也被称为“耶和华我们的父”，因为没有别的救赎主。玛拉基书：<br />我们岂不都是一位父吗？岂不是一位神造了我们吗？（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.10.htm">2:10</a>）<br />“造”表重生，如第一卷所示（<a href="16.htm">16</a>，<a href="88.htm">88</a>，<a href="472.htm">472</a>节）。此外，在整部旧约中，“耶和华”处处表示主，因为教会的一切宗教仪式都代表祂；就内义而言，圣言中的一切事物都论及祂。</p>

That "father" signifies that it would be from the Lord Himself, is evident from the signification of "father," as just explained, namely, that whatever was from the Father was from Him, because they 
were one. Every man's internal is from his father, and his external from his mother; or what is the same thing, the soul itself is from the father, and the body with which the soul is clothed is from 
the mother. The soul together with the body, although two, make a one; for the soul is the body's, and the body is the soul's; and therefore they are inseparable. The Lord's internal was from the Father, 
and therefore was the Father Himself, and hence it is that the Lord says that "the Father is in Him;" also, "I am in the Father and the Father in Me;" also, "He that seeth Me seeth the Father; I and 
the Father are one;" as may be seen in the passages cited above. In the Word of the Old Testament also the Lord is called "the Father," as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is 
given and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, the Father of Eternity, the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6). It is evident to everyone that 
the "Child" born to us and the "Son" given to us is the Lord, who is called the "Father of Eternity." Again in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thou art our Father, for Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge 
us. Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father, our Redeemer, from eternity is Thy name (Isa. 63:16); </p>
<p>where also it is the Lord who is called "Jehovah our Father," for there is no other "Redeemer." In 
Malachi: </p>
<p>     Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us? (Mal. 2:10). To "create" denotes to regenerate (as shown in Part First, n. 16, 88, 472). Besides that everywhere in the Word of 
the Old Testament, by "Jehovah" is meant the Lord, because all the rites of the church represented Him; and in the internal sense all things in the Word regard Him. </p>

'Father' means that which comes from Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'father', dealt with in what has just gone before, namely this: Whatever came from the Father came from the Lord as well since 
They were one. The human being in every case receives that which is internal from the father and that which is external from the mother; or what amounts to the same, the soul itself is from the father, 
the body which clothes the soul from the mother. Body and soul nevertheless make one, for the soul goes with the body, and body with soul, and are therefore inseparable. The Lord's Internal came 
from the Father and so was the Father Himself. Hence the Lord's declaration that 'the Father is within Him', that 'I am in the Father and the Father is in Me', He who sees Me sees the Father', 'I and 
the Father are one', as is clear from the places quoted above. In the Old Testament Word as well He is called Father, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
To us a Boy is born, to us a Son is given; and the government will 
be upon His shoulder, and His name will be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity Prince of Peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear to anyone that 'the Boy' born to us, and 'the Son' 
given to us, </p>
<p>is the Lord, who is named 'Father of Eternity'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You are our Father, for Abraham does not know us and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O Jehovah, are our Father, 
our Redeemer; from eternity is Your name. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also it is the Lord who is called 'Jehovah our Father', for there is no other Redeemer. In Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
Have we not all one Father? Has 
not one God created us? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 2:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Creating' stands for regenerating, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="88.htm">88</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>. Furthermore throughout the Old Testament Word Jehovah is used to mean the Lord, for 
He it was that all the Church's religious ceremonies represented; and He it is to whom everything that the Word contains in the internal sense has reference. </p>

Quod `pater' significet quod ab Ipso, constat a significatione `patris,' de quo in mox praecedentibus, nempe quod quicquid a Patre, hoc fuerit ab Ipso, quia unum: internum hominis cujuscumque est a 
patre, externum {1} a matre; seu quod idem, ipsa anima est a patre, corpus quo induitur anima, est a matre; anima cum corpore usque unum faciunt, nam anima est corporis, et corpus est animae, ideo inseparabilia: 
Internum Domini fuit a Patre, ita Ipse Pater, inde {2} est quod Dominus dicat quod `Pater in Ipso sit'; quod `Ego in Patre et Pater in Me'; `qui Me videt, Patrem videt'; quod `Ego et Pater 
unum simus,' ut a locis supra allatis constat. In Verbo Veteris Testamenti etiam Pater dicitur, ut apud Esaiam, 	Puer natus est nobis, filius datus est nobis, et erit principatus super humero illius, 
et vocabitur nomen illius, Mirabilis, Consiliarius, Deus, Heros, Pater aeternitatis, Princeps pacis, ix (x)5 [A.V.6]; </p>
<p>cuivis constat quod `Puer natus nobis, et filius datus nobis' sit Dominus: qui 
appellatur `Pater aeternitatis': apud eundem, 	Tu Pater noster, quia Abraham non cognoscit nos, et Israel non agnoscit nos, Tu Jehovah Pater noster, Redemptor noster: ab aeterno nomen Tuum, lxiii 16; </p>
<p>ubi 
quoque Dominus, Qui dicitur `Jehovah Pater noster,' non enim alius Redemptor est: apud Malachiam, 	Annon Pater unus omnibus nobis? annon Deus unus creavit nos? ii 10; </p>
<p>`creare' pro regenerare, 
ut ostensum in Parte Prima n. 16, 88, 472; praeter quod ubivis per `Jehovam' in Verbo Veteris Testamenti intelligatur Dominus, quia Ipsum repraesentarunt omnes ritus Ecclesiae; et Ipsum spectant in interno 
sensu omnia quae in Verbo. 	@1 i est.$ 	@2 i nam a Jehovah conceptus, quare non alius a Patre.$ </p>
