<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8872.</strong>“和地底下水中各物的”表存在于肉体感官层面的事物。这从“地底下水中各物的形像”的含义清楚可知，“地底下水中各物的形像”是指存在于属世之光中的事物之下的事物。这些事物存在于肉体感官层面，这一点从闪耀在一个人的理解力中的光之连续层级明显看出来。“天上各物”所表示的存在于属灵之光中的事物处于人里面的第一个层级。“下地各物”所表示的存在于属世之光中的事物处于第二层级。“地底下水中各物”所表示的存在于肉体感官层面的事物处于第三个层级。至于何为肉体感官层面及其性质，可参看前文（<a href="5084.htm">5084</a>，<a href="5089.htm">5089</a>，<a href="5094.htm">5094</a>，<a href="5125.htm">5125</a>，<a href="5128.htm">5128</a>，<a href="5580.htm">5580</a>，<a href="5767.htm">5767</a>，<a href="6183.htm">6183</a>，<a href="6201.htm">6201</a>，<a href="6310.htm">6310</a>-<a href="6316.htm">6316</a>，<a href="6318.htm">6318</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>，<a href="6612.htm">6612</a>，<a href="6614.htm">6614</a>，<a href="6622.htm">6622</a>，<a href="6624.htm">6624</a>，<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>，<a href="6845.htm">6845</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="6949.htm">6949</a>，<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>，<a href="7693.htm">7693</a>节）。那些从外在感官经验直接产生的记忆知识，以及伴随这类知识的快乐与肉体感官层面有关。对善人来说，这些知识及其快乐是良善的，因为它们被用于良善；但对恶人来说，它们是邪恶的，因为它们被用于邪恶。利用这些知识欺骗或迷惑人，如伪君子，假冒为善的人和骗子惯常所行的，就是在“作地底下水中各物的形像”</p>

Or of that which is in the waters under the earth. That this signifies such things as are in the sensuous corporeal, is evident from the signification of "a likeness of those things which are in the 
waters under the earth," as being the things below those which are in natural light; and that these things are such as are in the sensuous corporeal is manifest from the successive degrees of the light 
that belongs to the intellectual in man. In the first degree in man are those things which are in spiritual light, which are signified by "those which are in the heavens above." In the second degree 
are those which are in natural light, which are signified by "those which are in the earth beneath." And in the third degree are those which are in the sensuous corporeal, which are signified by "those 
which are in the waters under the earth." (What and of what quality is the sensuous corporeal, see n. 5084, 5089, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 6183, 6201, 6310-6316, 6318, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 
6624, 6844, 6845, 6948, 6949, 7442, 7693.) To the sensuous corporeal bear relation those memory-knowledges which arise most immediately from the experience of the external senses and also of their delights. 
With the good these knowledges and their delights are good because they are applied to goods; but with the evil they are evil because they are applied to evils. To deceive by means of these, as 
dissemblers, hypocrites, and the deceitful are wont to do, is to "make a likeness of such things as are in the waters under the earth." </p>

'And which are in the waters under the earth' means which exist on the level of the bodily senses. This is clear from the meaning of 'a likeness of the things which are in the waters under the earth', 
as those which come below the ones that exist in natural light. The fact that they exist on the level of the bodily senses is evident from the consecutive degrees of the light that shines in a person's 
understanding. In the first degree with him there are the things which exist in spiritual light; these are meant by 'the things which are in the heavens above'. In the second degree there are the 
things which exist in natural light; these are meant by 'the things which are on the earth beneath'. And in the third degree there are the things which exist on the level of the bodily senses; these are 
meant by 'the things which are in the waters under the earth'. What the level of the bodily senses is and the nature of it, see <a href="5084.htm">5084</a>, <a href="5089.htm">5089</a>, <a href="5094.htm">5094</a>, <a href="5125.htm">5125</a>, <a href="5128.htm">5128</a>, <a href="5580.htm">5580</a>, <a href="5767.htm">5767</a>, <a href="6183.htm">6183</a>, <a href="6201.htm">6201</a>, <a href="6310.htm">6310</a>-<a href="6316.htm">6316</a>, <a href="6318.htm">6318</a>, <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>, <a href="6612.htm">6612</a>, <a href="6614.htm">6614</a>, <a href="6622.htm">6622</a>, <a href="6624.htm">6624</a>, <a href="6844.htm">6844</a>, <a href="6845.htm">6845</a>, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="6949.htm">6949</a>, <a href="7442.htm">7442</a>, <a href="7693.htm">7693</a>. The things which come to be known most directly from the experience of the outward senses, and the delights accompanying such knowledge, 
are connected with the level of the bodily senses. With those who are good that knowledge and associated delights are good because they are used in good deeds; but with those who are bad they are 
bad because they are used in bad deeds. Misleading by means of such knowledge and its delights, as pretenders, hypocrites, and deceivers are accustomed to do, is 'making a likeness of such things as 
are below the waters under the earth.' </p>

`Et quae in aquis de sub terra': quod significet quae in sensuali corporeo, constat ex significatione `similitudinis illorum quae in aquis de sub terra' quod sint quae infra illa quae in luce naturali, 
quae quod sint illa quae in sensuali corporeo, patet a gradibus successivis lucis, quae (o)est intellectualis in homine; in primo gradu apud hominem {1} sunt quae in luce spirituali, quae significantur 
per illa `quae in caelis desuper sunt,' in secundo gradu sunt quae in luce naturali, quae significantur per illa `quae in terra desubter,' et in tertio gradu sunt quae in sensuali corporeo, quae 
significantur per `quae in aquis de sub terra'; quid et quale' sensuale corporeum, videatur n. 5084, 5089, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 6183, 6266, 6310-6316, 6318, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 6624, 6844, 
6845, 6948, 6949, 7442, 7693.  Ad sensuale corporeum se referunt scientifica quae ab experientia sensuum externorum proxime existunt, et quoque jucunda illorum; haec et illa apud bonos bona sunt, (o)quia 
applicantur ad bona, at apud malos mala sunt, (o)quia applicantur ad mala; fallere per illa, sicut solent simulatores, hypocritae, et dolosi, est `facere similitudinem talium quae sub aquis de 
sub (o)terra.' @1 illum$ </p>
