<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>227.</strong>觉知、内在声音、良知的来源，值得我们去了解。鉴于今日之人对此一无所知，就让我稍作说明。主藉精灵和天使引导人，这是千真万确的事实。当恶灵占据优势时，天使竭力阻止罪恶和错误，交战由此产生。因觉知、内在声音、良知的存在，人感受到的就是这种交战。在交战和试探中，人能明了精灵和天使的同在，只要他尚未完全沉溺于肉体，以致不信精灵和天使的存在。论到此等人，虽然他们时常感受到这种交战，却依然说精灵和天使只是幻想，是思维紊乱的产物。多年以来，我被允许了了分明地、成千上万次地感受这种交战，并了解导致这种交战的是谁，他们何时前来，何时离开，甚至与他们交谈。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]227.</strong> The source of perception, inner dictates, and conscience needs to be understood. Because no one these days knows anything about it, let me say a little.<br />It is entirely true that the Lord governs us through spirits and angels. When evil spirits start to take control, angels put their effort into deflecting evils and falsities, and conflict results. This conflict is what we sense by means of perception, an inner dictate, or conscience.<br />From these three sensations, and from the trials we are going through, we would see clearly that spirits and angels are present with us if our focus were not thoroughly physical. Such a focus prevents us from believing anything we hear about spirits and angels. Body-centered people could experience those conflicts a hundred times over and still claim that an overactive imagination or some kind of mental illness lay at the root of them.<br />I myself have had the opportunity to experience conflict and its vivid sensation thousands upon thousands of times — almost continually now for several years. I have been able to learn what spirits were involved, what they were like, just where they were, at what moment they approached, and what time they left, and I have been allowed to speak to them. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 227</b></p><p><b>227.</b>
As it is desirable that the origin of perception, internal dictate, and conscience, should be known, and as at the present day it is altogether unknown, I may relate something on the subject. It is a 
great truth that man is governed by the Lord by means of spirits and angels. When evil spirits begin to rule, the angels labor to avert evils and falsities, and hence arises a combat. It is this combat 
of which the man is rendered sensible by perception, dictate, and conscience. By these, and also by temptations, a man might clearly see that spirits and angels are with him, were he not so deeply 
immersed in corporeal things as to believe nothing that is said about spirits and angels. Such persons, even if they were to feel these combats hundreds of times, would still say that they are imaginary, 
and the effect of a disordered mind. I have been permitted to feel such combats, and to have a vivid sense of them, thousands and thousands of times, and this almost constantly for several years, 
as well as to know who, what, and where they were that caused them, when they came, and when they departed; and I have conversed with them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 227</b></p><p><b>227.</b>
But seeing that the origin of perception, dictate, and conscience needs to be known, it being totally unknown at the present day, let some reference be made to it here. It is a momentous truth that the 
Lord governs man by means of spirits and angels. When evil spirits start to have dominion, angels set to work to ward off evils and falsities, as a consequence of which conflict arises. And it is by 
means of perception, dictate, and conscience that a person comes to feel this conflict. These, together with temptations, make it possible for a person to become plainly aware of the fact that spirits 
and angels are residing with him, provided he is not so totally engrossed in bodily interests that he believes nothing he is told about spirits and angels. Consequently if such people were to experience 
conflict a hundred times over they would still call them delusions and the result of some mental disturbance. I have been allowed almost constantly for several years now to experience thousands 
of times these conflicts and the resultant feeling, and also to know who those spirits and angels were, what they were like, where they came from, when they arrived, and when they went away; and I have 
talked to them.  </p>

</p><b>227.</b>
Sed sciendum unde perceptio, dictamen, et conscientia; hoc quia prorsus ignotum hodie est, aliquid de eo referre licet. Verissimum est quod homo per spiritus et angelos a Domino regatur: cum spiritus 
mali incipiunt dominari, tunc angeli in labore sunt avertendi mala et falsa, quare existit pugna; haec pugna est quae per perceptionem, dictamen, et conscientiam sentitur: ex iis, tum a tentationibus, 
scire potuisset homo manifeste quod spiritus et angeli apud eum {x}sint, nisi in corporeis totus tantus esset ut nihil credat quod dicitur de spiritibus et angelis; quare tales, si centies sentirent 
pugnas, usque dicerent esse phantasias, et quoddam animi aegrotum, quod causatur: pugnas et inde sensum vivum millies millies et fere continue nunc intra aliquot annos sentiri mihi datum est, tum quinam 
essent, quales, ubinam, quando alluerunt, cum discesserunt, et cum iis locutus.
