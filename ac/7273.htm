<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7273.</strong>“也要多行神迹奇事”表各种预警，以及没有一样东西是缺乏的。这从“神迹奇事”的含义清楚可知，“神迹奇事”是指真理的确认（参看<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>，<a href="6870.htm">6870</a>，<a href="7012.htm">7012</a>节），也指神性能力所采取的手段（<a href="6910.htm">6910</a>节），在此是指预警；因为这些神迹奇事让他们看到他们沉浸于虚假之中，也让他们看到神性能力，以这种方式受到预警。之所以说给予那些沉浸于虚假之人的各种预警，以及没有一样东西是缺乏的，是因为对那些陷入邪恶之人的定罪或诅咒不是在他们进入来世时的那一瞬间进行的，而是在他们首先被查访，也就是接受检查之后进行的。检查的目的是为了让那些人自己发现，他们不可避免地受到诅咒，因为他们没有过其它生活，也为了让灵人和天使能知道这些人是什么样子。这样他们就不能再为自己开脱罪责，或其他人不能再为他们开脱罪责。<br />他们被检查所遵循的秩序是神性真理的秩序；这秩序具有这样的性质，没有一样东西是缺乏的。应用于被诅咒或被定罪的恶人的神之真理的秩序不同于应用于得救的善人的神之真理的秩序。区别在于，当这秩序应用于被诅咒或定罪的恶人时，神的真理与神性良善，因而与怜悯是分离的，因为这些人不接受神性良善，因而弃绝怜悯。但当这秩序应用于得救的善人时，神的真理与神性良善，因而与怜悯是结合的；因为他们接受神性良善，因而接受主的怜悯。恶人照秩序一步一步地接受检查，故也一步一步地受到审判，并被定罪。由此可见，给予各种预警是为了在他们被判入地狱之前，没有一样东西是缺乏的。这些就是在长子被杀，埃及人在红海中灭亡之前，在埃及所行的神迹异事所表示的事；因为红海是指地狱。</p>

And I will multiply my signs and My wonders. That this signifies warnings of every kind, nor shall anything be wanting, is evident from the signification of "signs and wonders," as being confirmations 
of the truth (see n. 3900, 6870, 7012), and also means of Divine power (n. 6910); here warnings; for thereby they both saw that they were in falsities, and saw the Divine power, and in this way were 
warned. The reason why it is said that to those who are in falsities warnings are given of every kind, nor shall anything be wanting, is that the condemnation of those who are in evils is not effected 
in a moment when they come into the other life, but after they have first been visited, that is, examined. The examinations are made in order that they themselves may take notice that they cannot but 
be condemned, because they have not lived differently, and also in order that spirits and angels may know that they have been of such a character; so that they can no longer be excused either by themselves 
or by others. The order in accordance with which they are examined is the order of truth Divine, which is such that nothing whatever is wanting. The order of truth Divine, which is for the evil 
who are being condemned, differs from that of truth Divine for the good who are being saved. The difference is, that the order for the evil who are being condemned, is of truth Divine separated from 
Divine good, thus from mercy, because they have not received the Divine good, and thus have rejected mercy. But the order which is for the good who are being saved, is of truth Divine conjoined with 
Divine good, thus with mercy; because they have received the Divine good, thus the mercy of the Lord. By degrees, as the evil are examined in accordance with order, so also are they judged and condemned. 
This shows that warnings of every kind are given, in order that nothing may be wanting before they are condemned to hell. These then are the things which are signified by the signs and wonders wrought 
in Egypt, before the firstborn were slain, and the Egyptians perished in the sea Suph; for the sea Suph denotes hell. </p>

'And multiply My signs and My wonders' means forewarnings of every kind, and that not a thing will be wanting. This is clear from the meaning of 'signs and wonders' as proofs of the truth, dealt with 
in <a href="3900.htm">3900</a>, <a href="6870.htm">6870</a>, <a href="7012.htm">7012</a>, and also as the means used by Divine power, <a href="6910.htm">6910</a>, here as forewarnings, for those signs and wonders let them see that they were immersed in falsities and also let them behold Divine 
power, as a result of which they were forewarned. The reason for saying that forewarnings of every kind are being presented to those steeped in falsities, and that not a thing will be wanting, is 
that the damnation of those governed by evils does not take place in a single moment when they enter the next life, only after they have first been visited, that is, been examined. Examinations are made 
to the end that those people may see for themselves that they are inescapably damned because they have led no other kind of life, and to the end also that spirits and angels may know what those people 
have been like. Thus they can no longer exonerate themselves or be exonerated by others. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The order that governs the manner in which they are examined is the order involving God's truth; and 
the nature of this is such that nothing whatever is wanting. When this order involving God's truth is applied to the evil who are damned it is different from what it is when applied to the good who are 
saved. The difference is that when that order is applied to the evil who are damned God's truth is separated from Divine Good, that is, from mercy because those people have not accepted Divine Good, 
and so have refused mercy. But when that order is applied to the good who are saved God's truth is coupled with Divine Good, and so with mercy because they have accepted Divine Good, and so the Lord's 
mercy. Step by step as the evil undergo orderly examination they are also judged and condemned. From this one may see that forewarnings of every kind are presented, in order that not a thing may be 
wanting before they are condemned to hell. These are what is also meant by the signs and miracles performed in Egypt, before the firstborn were annihilated and the Egyptians were destroyed in the Sea 
Suph, the Sea Suph being hell. </p>

`Et multiplicabo signa Mea et prodigia Mea': quod significet admonitiones omnis generis, nec aliquid deerit, constat ex significatione `signorum et prodigiorum' quod sint confirmationes veritatis, de 
qua n. 3900, 6870, 7012, et quoque potentiae Divinae media, n. 6910, hic admonitiones, nam {1}sic et videbant quod in falsis essent, et videbant potentiam Divinam, (c)et inde admonebantur.  Quod dicatur 
quod ad illos qui in falsis admonitiones fiant omnis generis, nec aliquid deerit, est quia damnatio illorum qui in malis non fit momento cum in alteram vitam veniunt, sed postquam primum {2}visitati 
sunt, hoc est, explorati; explorationes fiunt ob causam ut ipsi appercipiant quod non aliter possint quam damnari, quia non aliter vixerunt; tum quoque ut spiritus et angeli sciant quod tales fuerint; 
ita non amplius possunt exculpari apud semet, {3}nec apud 2 alios; ordo secundum quem explorantur est ordo veri Divini qui talis est ut prorsus nihil desit; ordo veri Divini qui est malis qui {4}damnantur 
differt ab ordine veri Divini qui est bonis qui salvantur; differentia est quod {5} ordo {6} qui est malis qui {7}damnantur sit veri Divini separati a Divino Bono, ita a misericordia, ex causa 
quia non receperunt Divinum Bonum, ac ita rejecerunt misericordiam; hic autem ordo {6} qui est bonis qui salvantur est veri Divini conjuncti Divino Bono, ita misericordiae; ex causa quia Divinum Bonum 
receperunt, ita Domini misericordiam; per gradus, sicut mali secundum ordinem explorantur, ita quoque {8} judicantur (c)et damnantur.  Inde sciri potest quod fiant admonitiones omnis generis, ut non 
aliquid desit antequam damnantur inferno; haec sunt quae quoque significantur per signa et miracula facta in Aegypto, antequam primogenita exstincta sunt, et Aegyptii in mari Suph perierunt; mare Suph 
enim est infernum. 	@1 per signa et miracula$ 	@2 explorati sunt$ 	@3 et$ 	@4 judicantur$ 	@5 i illi$ 	@6 i, nempe$ 	@7 judicantur,$ 	@8 i per gradus$ </p>
