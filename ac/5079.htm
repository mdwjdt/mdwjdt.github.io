<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5079节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5079.</strong>“他们的主埃及王”表它们，即“酒政”和“膳长”所表示的外在感官事物，或身体感官事物，与属世人的新状态相反。这从“埃及王”的含义清楚可知，“埃及王”是指总体的记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。由于“王”是民族的头，故“埃及王”和“埃及”的含义相同，在凡提及民族的王，无论哪个民族的其它地方意思也一样（<a href="4789.htm">4789</a>节）。由于“埃及王”表示总体上的记忆知识，所以他也表示属世人；事实上，一切记忆知识都是属世人的真理（<a href="4967.htm">4967</a>节）。“主”表示属世人的良善本身（<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>节）。之所以在此表示属世人的新状态，是因为前一章论述了属世层的内层，它们已变新，或就论述主的至高意义而言，它们已得荣耀；而本章论述了属世层的内层，它们要被带入与这些内层的和谐一致中。“他们的主埃及王”表示已变新的属世层的内层，或也可说，属世人的新状态；“酒政”和“膳长”表示未被带入次序，因而违背次序的外层。<br />属世层有内层和外层之分，属世层的内层是指记忆知识和对它们的情感，而属世层的外层是指这两种感官觉知，如前所述（<a href="5077.htm">5077</a>节）。当人死去时，他会将属世层的这些外层留在身后；将属世层的内层带入来世，在那里这些内层作为一个层面服务于属灵和属天之物。因为当人死去时，除了他的骨肉外，他什么也没失去，而是将他所行、所说、所思的一切都保留在记忆中，并保有一切属世情感和渴望，因而保有属世层的一切内层。他不需要属世层的外层，因为他看不见尘世中的任何事物，听不见尘世中的任何声音，也闻不见、尝不到，或摸不到尘世中的任何东西，只有诸如来世中的事物除外。诚然，来世的事物在很大程度上看似和尘世的相似，其实并不一样，因为它们含有活物在里面，诸如适合自然界的那些事物却没有活物在里面。因为来世的每一个事物，其开始和存续都仰赖灵界的太阳，也就是主；因此它含有活物在里面；而自然界的每一个事物，其开始和存续却仰赖自然界的太阳，也就是物质之火，因此它没有活物在里面。它的起源唯独在于灵界，也就是通过灵界在于主，这一事实赋予它含有生命在里面的表象。</p>

Against their lord the king of Egypt. That this signifies that they-namely, the external sensuous things, or those of the body, signified by "the butler and the baker"-were contrary to the new state 
of the natural man, is evident from the signification of the "king of Egypt" as being memory-knowledge in general (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966). For the same is signified by the "king 
of Egypt" as by "Egypt," the king being the head of the nation; and it is the same in other passages also where mention is made of the "king" of any nation (n. 4789). As memory-knowledge in general 
is signified by the "king of Egypt," the natural man is also signified thereby, because all memory-knowledge is the truth of the natural man (4967): the good itself of the natural man is signified by 
"lord" (n. 4973). That a new state of the natural man is here signified, is because in the preceding chapter there was described the making new of the interiors of the natural, and in the supreme sense, 
which relates to the Lord, that they were glorified; but the subject here treated of is the exteriors of the natural, which were to be reduced to harmony or correspondence with the interiors. Those 
interiors of the natural which were new, or what is the same thing, the new state of the natural man, is what is signified by "their lord the king of Egypt;" and the exteriors which were not reduced 
into order, and hence were contrary to order, are what are signified by "the butler and the baker." [2] There are interiors and there are exteriors of the natural, the interiors of the natural being 
memory-knowledges and the affections of them, while its exteriors are the sensuous things of both kinds, spoken of above (n. 5077). When a man dies he leaves behind him these exteriors of the natural, 
but carries with him into the other life the interiors of the natural, where they serve as a plane for things spiritual and celestial. For when a man dies he loses nothing except his bones and flesh; 
he has with him the memory of all that he had done, spoken, or thought, and he has with him all his natural affections and desires, thus all the interiors of the natural. Of its exteriors he has no 
need; for he does not see, nor hear, nor smell, nor taste, nor touch, what is in this world, but only such things as are in the other life, which indeed look for the most part like those which are in 
this world; but still are not like them, for they have in them what is living, which those things which properly belong to the natural world have not. For all and each of the things in the other life 
come forth and subsist from the sun there, which is the Lord, whence they have in them what is living; whereas all and each of the things in the natural world come forth and subsist from its sun, which 
is elementary fire, and hence have not in them what is living. What appears living in them is from no other source than the spiritual world, that is, through the spiritual world from the Lord. </p>

'Against their lord the king of Egypt' means that these - the external or bodily senses, meant by 'the cupbearer and the baker' - were contrary to the new state in the natural man. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'the king of Egypt' as factual knowledge in general, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>; for, the king being the head of the nation, 'the king of Egypt' is similar 
in meaning to 'Egypt', the same as in other places where the king of any nation is referred to or named, <a href="4789.htm">4789</a>. Since factual knowledge in general is meant by 'the king of Egypt', so also is the natural 
man meant by him; for all factual knowledge is truth as it exists in the natural man, <a href="4967.htm">4967</a>. While the actual good there is meant by 'the lord', <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>. The reason a new state in the natural man is meant 
is that the previous chapter dealt with the interior aspects of the natural, which were made new, or - in the highest sense, in which the Lord is the subject - were glorified, whereas the present chapter 
deals with the exterior aspects of the natural which are to be brought into accord or agreement with those interior ones. These interior aspects of the natural which have been made new - or, what 
amounts to the same, a new state in the natural man - are what are meant by 'the lord the king of Egypt', while the exterior aspects which have not been brought into a state of order and are consequently 
contrary to it are meant by 'the cupbearer and the baker'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are interior aspects of the natural and there are exterior ones. The interior aspects of the natural are known facts and 
the affections for them, but the exterior aspects are both kinds of sensory perception spoken of above in <a href="5077.htm">5077</a>. When a person dies he leaves behind those exterior aspects of the natural; but the interior 
aspects of the natural he takes with him into the next life where they serve as the foundation on which spiritual and celestial things can be based; for when a person dies he loses nothing apart from 
his flesh and bones. He keeps his memory in which everything he has done, spoken, or thought is recorded, and he keeps every natural affection and desire, and so every interior aspect of the natural. 
He does not need its exterior aspects, for he does not see anything that is in the world, or hear anything that is in the world, or smell, taste, or touch anything that is in the world, only what 
is in the next life. Things in the next life, it is true, seem for the most part to be like those in the world, but they are not, for they hold what is living within them, such as things proper to the 
natural world do not hold within them. For every single thing in the next life owes the beginning and the continuance of its existence to the Sun there, which is the Lord, as a consequence of which it 
has that which is living within it. But every single thing in the natural world owes the beginning and the continuance of its existence to the sun there, which is material fire, as a consequence of 
which it does not have that which is living within it. What gives it the appearance of having life within it is that its origin lies solely in the spiritual world, that is, in the Lord through the spiritual world. </p>

`Domino suo regi Aegypti': quod significet quod essent contra naturalis hominis statum novum, nempe sensualia externa seu corporis, quae per `pincernam et pistorem' significantur, constat ex significatione 
`regis Aegypti' quod sit scientificum in genere, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966; simile enim significatur per `regem Aegypti' quod per Aegyptum, est enim rex caput gentis; 
pariter alibi ubi alicujus gentis rex dicitur vel nominatur, n. 4789; quia est scientificum in genere quod significatur per `regem Aegypti', est quoque naturalis homo, nam omne scientificum est 
verum naturalis hominis, n. 4967, ipsum bonum ibi significatur per `dominum', n. 4973. Quod ejus status novus significetur est quia in capite praecedente actum est de interioribus naturalis quod 
nova facta, in supremo sensu in quo de Domino quod glorificata; nunc autem agitur de exterioribus naturalis, quae ad concordantiam seu correspondentiam cum interioribus redigenda; interiora illa naturalis 
quae nova, {1}seu quod idem, naturalis illius hominis status novus, est qui significatur per `dominum regem Aegypti', et exteriora quae non in ordinem 2 redacta, et inde contra illum, per 
`pincernam et pistorem'. Sunt interiora et sunt exteriora naturalis; interiora naturalis sunt scientifica et affectiones {2}illorum, exteriora vero sunt sensualia utriusque generis, de quibus supra 
n. 5077; </p>
<p>haec, nempe exteriora naturalis, homo relinquit cum moritur, sed illa, nempe interiora naturalis secum fert in alteram vitam, ubi {3} inserviunt pro plano spiritualibus et caelestibus; homo 
enim cum moritur, nihil amittit praeter ossa et carnem; secum habet memoriam omnium quae egerat, locutus est, et cogitaverat, et secum habet omnes affectiones et cupiditates naturales, ita omnia interiora 
naturalis; exterioribus ejus non opus habet, nam non videt {4}quae in mundo, nec audit quae in mundo, nec odorat, gustat et tangit quae in mundo, sed quae in altera vita; quae quidem quoad multam 
partem similia apparent iis quae in mundo, sed usque non sunt similia, in se enim vivum habent, quod non habent illa quae `proprie sunt' mundi naturalis; omnia enim et singula {5} ibi existunt 
et subsistunt a Sole qui est Dominus, inde vivum in se habent; at omnia et singula quae in mundo naturali, existunt et subsistunt a sole, qui est ignis elementaris, inde vivum in se non habent; 
vivum quod in his apparet, non aliunde est quam ex mundo spirituali, hoc est, per mundum spiritualem a Domino. @1 seu naturalis ille homo qui novus$ @2 naturales$ @3 i illi$ @4 quid I$ @5 After
