<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7840节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7840.</strong>“你们要从羔羊或母山羊里取”表纯真的内层和外层良善，或纯真的良善，包括外层的和内层的。这从“羔羊”和“母山羊”或“小山羊”的含义清楚可知：“羔羊”是指纯真的良善（参看<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>节）；“母山羊”或“小山羊”是指拥有纯真在里面的真理之良善（<a href="3995.htm">3995</a>，<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>，<a href="4006.htm">4006</a>，<a href="4871.htm">4871</a>节）。“羔羊”表示纯真的内层良善，“小山羊”或“母山羊”表示纯真的外层良善（参看<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节）。必须简要说一说何谓纯真的内层良善和外层良善。一切良善若要成为良善，就必须拥有纯真在里面。没有纯真，良善可以说就没有灵魂。原因在于，主通过纯真流入，并通过纯真将生命赋予存在于那些正在重生之人中间的良善。被纯真赋予生命的良善分为内在的和外在的；内在良善与那些被称为内在教会成员的人同在，而外在良善与那些被称为外在教会成员的人同在。内在教会成员是那些通过诸如属于圣言内义的内层真理给自己的良善带来具体品质的人；而外在教会成员是那些通过诸如属于圣言字义的外层真理给自己良善带来具体品质的人。内在教会成员是那些出于对仁爱的情感而被引导向邻舍行善的人；而外在教会成员是那些出于顺从而被引导向邻舍行善的人。凡正在重生的人首先成为一个外在教会的成员，然后成为一个内在教会成员。那些属于内在教会的人在聪明和智慧上胜过那些属于外在教会的人，因而在天堂占据更内在的位置。由此可见何为纯真的内层良善和外层良善。</p>

Ye shall take it from the lambs and from the she goats.* That this signifies the good of innocence exterior and interior, is evident from the signification of a "lamb," as being the good of innocence 
(see n. 3994); and from the signification of a "she-goat" or "kid," as being the good of truth in which is innocence (n. 3995, 4005, 4006, 4871). (That a "lamb" denotes the interior good of innocence, 
and a "kid," or a "she-goat," the exterior good of innocence, see n. 3519.) What is meant by the interior and the exterior good of innocence shall be briefly told. In every good there must be innocence 
that it may be good; without innocence good is as if without its soul. The reason is that the Lord flows in by means of innocence, and by means of it vivifies the good with those who are being regenerated. 
The good which innocence vivifies is internal and external; internal good is with those who are called men of the internal church; but external good is with those who are men of the external 
church. Men of the internal church are they who have qualified their good by means of interior truths, such as are those of the internal sense of the Word; but men of the external church are they who 
have qualified their good by means of exterior truths, such as are those of the literal sense of the Word. Men of the internal church are they who do what is good to the neighbor from the affection of 
charity; but men of the external church are they who do it from obedience. Every man while being regenerated first becomes a man of the external church, and afterward a man of the internal church. They 
who are of the internal church are in intelligence and wisdom in advance of those who are of the external church, and are therefore more interiorly in heaven. From all this it is now evident what 
the interior and exterior good of innocence are. * Latin capra, Hebrew ez, a "she-goat," the mother being taken for her little one. Both "kids" and "she-goats" signify "the innocence of the external 
or natural man, thus the truth and the good of innocence" (Arcana Coelestia n. 3518, subdivisions 3 and 4). [Reviser.] </p>

'From the lambs and from the she-goats you shall take it' means the good of innocence, interior and exterior. This is clear from the meaning of 'a lamb' as the good of innocence, dealt with in <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'a she-goat' or of 'a kid' as the good of truth that has innocence within it, dealt with in <a href="3995.htm">3995</a>, <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>, <a href="4006.htm">4006</a>, <a href="4871.htm">4871</a>. For the meaning of 'a lamb' as the interior good of innocence, 
and of 'a kid' or 'a she-goat' as the exterior good of innocence, see <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>. What is meant by the good of innocence, interior and exterior, must be stated briefly. To be good, all good must have innocence 
within it. Without innocence good is devoid of its soul, so to speak. The reason for this is that the Lord flows in through innocence, and by means of it gives life to the good that exists with 
those who are being regenerated. The good that innocence gives life to is internal and external. Internal good resides with those who are called members of the internal Church, while external good resides 
with those who are members of the external Church. Members of the internal Church are those who have brought a specific quality to their good by means of interior truths such as belong to the internal 
sense of the Word, whereas members of the external Church are those who have brought a specific quality to their good by means of exterior truths such as belong to the literal sense of the Word. 
Members of the internal Church are those who are led to do good to the neighbour by an affection rising out of charity, whereas members of the external Church are led to do it by a sense of obedience. 
Every person who is being regenerated first becomes a member of the external Church, then later on a member of the internal Church. Those who belong to the internal Church excel in understanding and 
wisdom over those who belong to the external Church, and therefore also occupy a more internal position in heaven. From all this one may now see what the good of innocence, interior and exterior, is. </p>

`Ex agnis et ex capris accipietis': quod significet bonum innocentiae exterius et interius, constat ex significatione `agni' quod sit bonum innocentiae, de qua n. 3994; et ex significatione `caprae' 
aut `haedi' quod sit veri bonum in quo innocentia, de qua n. 3995, 4005, 4006, 4871; quod `agnus' sit bonum innocentiae interius, et `haedus' {1}seu `capra' bonum innocentiae exterius, videatur n. 3519. 
 Quid per bonum innocentiae interius et exterius intelligitur, paucis dicetur: in omni bono erit innocentia, ut sit bonum; absque innocentia est bonum sicut absque sua anima; causa est quia Dominus 
per innocentiam influit et per illam vivificat bonum apud illos qui regenerantur; bonum {2} quod innocentia vivificat est internum et externum; bonum internum est apud illos qui vocantur homines Ecclesiae 
internae, at bonum externum est apud illos qui sunt homines Ecclesiae externae; homines Ecclesiae internae sunt qui qualificarunt bonum suum per vera interiora {3} qualia sunt sensus interni Verbi, 
at homines Ecclesiae externae sunt qui qualificarunt bonum suum per vera exteriora qualia sunt sensus litteralis Verbi; {4} homines Ecclesiae internae sunt qui ex affectione charitatis faciunt proximo 
bonum, at homines Ecclesiae externae qui ex oboedientia; omnis homo cum regeneratur, primum fit homo Ecclesiae externae, postmodum autem homo Ecclesiae internae; qui ab (t)Ecclesia interna sunt 
in intelligentia et sapientia sunt prae illis qui ab Ecclesia externa, et ideo quoque interius in caelo; ex his nunc patet quid bonum innocentiae interius et exterius. 	@1 aut$ 	@2 i autem$ 	@3 i et$ 	@4 i seu$ </p>
