<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10661节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10661</strong>.“你一切的牲畜中，公的你都要交出来”表通过真理被赐予的。这从“公的”的含义清楚可知，“公的”是指真理（参看<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>，<a href="7838.htm">7838</a>节）。此处的情形是这样：人从主所获得的一切良善都是通过真理被赐予他的。因为人生来什么都不知道；当他开始成长时，就属灵事物而言，他凭自己便完全处在黑暗之中，因为他对神、主、天堂和地狱，以及死后的生命一无所知。他凭自己所知道的一切都与世界和他自己有关。他将为他自己的利益而存在于世界上的事物称为良善，将支持它的事物称为真理。因此，为叫他可以拥有天堂的良善，他必须爱这良善胜过自己和世界，他必须从圣言，或从源于圣言的教会教义学习真理。他在学习这些真理，因而在知道它们之前，无法热爱它们；因为人对未知的事物不可能拥有任何情感。正因如此，人通过真理而拥有良善。但与一个人同住的真理只有等到这个人热爱它时才会变成良善；因为凡被爱的都是良善。爱就是意愿并实行，因为一个人会去意愿并实行他所爱的。真理以这种方式变成良善。这就是一切的牲畜中，公的他们都要交出来这个要求所表示的。</p>

And of all thy cattle thou shalt give the male. That this signifies that it is given by means of truth, is evident from the signification of "male," as being truth (see n. 2046, 4005, 7838). The case 
herein is this. All the good that man has from the Lord is given him by means of truth. For man is born into mere ignorance, and when he advances in age, he has from himself mere thick darkness in spiritual 
things, for he knows nothing about God, the Lord, heaven and hell, or the life after death. What he knows from himself is about the world and himself; and he calls that good in the world which 
is in favor of himself; and he calls that true which confirms this. In order therefore that he may have heavenly good, which he will love more than himself and the world, it is necessary for him to learn 
truths from the Word, or from the doctrine of the church which is from the Word. He cannot love these truths until he knows them, because any affection for what is unknown is impossible. From this 
it is that truth is that by means of which man has good. The truth with a man becomes good when he loves it; for all that which is loved is good. To love is to will and to do, because that which a man 
loves, he wills and does. In this way truth becomes good. This then is what is signified by their "giving the male of all the cattle." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10661</b></p><p><b>10661.</b>
'Of all your cattle you are to give the male' means which is imparted by means of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the male' as truth, dealt with in <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>, <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>, <a href="7838.htm">7838</a>. The situation is that all 
good which a person receives from the Lord is imparted to him by means of truth. For at birth the human being has no knowledge of anything at all; and when he starts to grow up, he is, if left to himself, 
completely in the dark so far as spiritual things are concerned, for he knows nothing about God, the Lord, heaven and hell, and life after death. All that he knows, if left to himself, has regard 
to the world and to himself. That which exists in the world for his own benefit he calls good, and that which lends support to it he calls true. In order therefore that he may come into possession 
of heavenly good, which he must love more than himself and the world, it is necessary for him to learn truths from the Word, or from the teachings of the Church which are derived from the Word. Until 
he has learned them, thus until he has knowledge of them, he cannot love them; for no one can have an affection for something that he has no knowledge of. So it is that truth is the means by which good 
is imparted to a person. But the truth residing with a person becomes good when he loves it; for everything that is loved is a form of good. Loving consists in intending and doing; for what a person 
loves he intends and does; in this way truth becomes good. This then is what is meant by the requirement that the male of all cattle should be given.  </p>

`Ex omni pecore tuo des masculum':  quod significet quod datur per verum, constat ex significatione `masculi' quod sit verum, de qua n. 2046, 4005, 7838.  Cum his ita se habet:  omne bonum quod homini 
a Domino, datur ei per verum, homo enim nascitur in meram ignorantiam, et cum adolescit aetate, est illi ex se mera caligo in spiritualibus, nihil enim scit de Deo, de Domino, de caelo et inferno, 
de vita post mortem {1}; {2}quod scit ex se, est de mundo et de semet, et id bonum vocat quod in mundo pro se est, et id verum vocat quod confirmat id; ut ergo ei bonum caeleste, quod amabit prae {3}se 
et mundo, sit, necessum est ut discat vera (c)a Verbo, seu ex doctrina Ecclesia quae ex Verbo; antequam illa didicit, ita antequam illa scit, non potest amare illa, nam affectio ignoti non datur, inde 
est quod verum sit per quod bonum homini; verum apud hominem tunc fit bonum quando amat id, nam omne quod amatur est bonum; amare est velle et facere, nam quod homo amat, hoc vult et {4}facit; sic 
verum fit bonum; hoc nunc est quod significatur per quod ex omni pecore darent masculum. @1 i, de fide et de charitate$ @2 quod scit, per quod ei lumen est de se et de mundo, inde$ @3 bono sui et mundi$ @4 i hoc$ </p>
