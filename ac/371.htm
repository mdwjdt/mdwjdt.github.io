<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第371节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>371.</strong>上古之人用“耶和华正说话”表示觉知，因为他们知道，主赐予他们觉知的能力。只要爱是首要之事，这种觉知就持续存在。当对主之爱、从而对邻之爱没有了，觉知也就消失了。爱有多少，觉知就有多少。这种觉知的能力是上古教会特有的，但当信从爱分离，如大洪水后的人们那样，仁就通过信被赐下，于是良心便取代觉知，它也给予指示，但方式不同，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。当良心指示时，在圣言中同样表述为“耶和华说”，因为良心通过圣言所揭示的事以及源自它的认知形成；圣言说或指示，就是主在说。因此，当涉及良心或信的问题时，最为常见的表述就是“主说”，即便现在也是这样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]371.</strong> When the earliest people described Jehovah as speaking, they meant perception, because they realized that the Lord made it possible for them to perceive. This capacity for perception lasted only as long as love had primary importance. When love for the Lord came to an end, and love for others consequently did the same, perception died out. To the extent that love remained, perception remained.<br />This perceptiveness was distinctive to the earliest church. After faith had been separated from love, as it was in those who lived after the Flood, and charity was being acquired by way of faith, conscience took over. Conscience, too, speaks from within, but not in the same way. More on this will, by the Lord's divine mercy, appear later.{*1} When conscience dictates, the Word describes it the same way — that is, as speech by Jehovah. Our conscience is formed from the revelations and knowledge of Scripture, and when the Word speaks or supplies an inner dictate, it is the Lord who is speaking. No expression is more common, even today, than "the Lord says" when we refer to a matter of conscience or of faith.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the shift from perception to conscience in people who lived after the Flood, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_371/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_371/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_573" target=_top>573</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_371/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597" target=_top>597</a>.

By the "speaking of Jehovah" the most ancient people signified perception, for they knew that the Lord gave them the faculty to perceive. This perception could continue no longer than while love was 
the principal. When love to the Lord ceased, and consequently love toward the neighbor, perception perished; but insofar as love remained, perception remained. This perceptive faculty was proper to the 
Most Ancient Church, but when faith became separated from love, as in the people after the flood, and charity was given through faith, then conscience succeeded, which also gives a dictate, but in a 
different way, of which, by the Lord's Divine mercy, hereafter. When conscience dictates, it is in like manner said in the Word that "Jehovah speaks;" because conscience is formed from things revealed, 
and from knowledges, and from the Word; and when the Word speaks, or dictates, it is the Lord who speaks; hence nothing is more common, even at the present day, when referring to a matter of conscience, 
or of faith, than to say, "the Lord says." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 371</b></p><p><b>371.</b>
When the most ancient people used the phrase 'Jehovah is saying' they meant perception, for they recognized that it was the Lord who enabled them to perceive. This perception could last only so long 
as love remained the chief thing. When love to the Lord, and so love towards the neighbour, died out, perception came to an end, the amount of love that remained determining the amount of perception they 
had. This power of perception was peculiar to the Most Ancient Church, but after faith had been separated from love, as it was among those following the Flood, and charity was conferred through faith, 
conscience took the place of perception. This conscience was a dictate as well, though in a different way; but this in the Lord's Divine mercy will be discussed later on. When conscience dictates, 
it is likewise said that 'Jehovah says' in the Word, for conscience is formed from things revealed in the Word, and from cognitions derived from it. And when the Word states or dictates, it is the Lord 
who is stating. Consequently nothing is more common, even today, than to assert that 'the Lord is saying' when referring to some matter of conscience or of faith.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 371</b>
</p><b>371.</b>
Antiquissimi per 'loquentem Jehovam' significabant perceptionem, nam noverunt quod Dominus daret illis percipere; perceptio haec non diutius manere potuit quam cum amor principale esset; cum cessavit 
amor in Dominum, et sic erga proximum, periit perceptio; et quantum amoris remansit, tantum perceptionis. Perceptivum hoc proprium erat Antiquissimae Ecclesiae; sed postquam fides separata est ab amore, 
ut in postdiluvianis, et charitas data per fidem, successit conscientia, quae quoque dictat, sed alio modo, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. Cum conscientia dictat, similiter 
dicitur, nempe quod Jehovah loquatur in Verbo; quia conscientia formatur ex revelatis et cognitionibus e Verbo; et cum Verbum dicit seu dictat, est Dominus qui dicit; quare nihil communius est dicere, 
etiam hodie, quam quod Dominus loquatur, cum agitur de re conscientiae aut fidei. </p>
