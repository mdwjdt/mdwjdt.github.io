<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3080节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3080.</strong>“那少女容貌极其俊美”表对真理的情感的美丽。这从“少女”的含义清楚可知，“少女”是指拥有纯真在里面的情感（参看<a href="3067.htm">3067</a>节）。“容貌极其俊美”表美丽，在此表对真理的情感的美丽。其原因在于，一切美丽都来自含有纯真的良善。良善本身在从内在人流入，并进入外在人时，就构成了美丽；人的一切美丽由此而来。这同样从以下事实可以看出来：在别人里面激发感觉的不是脸，而是脸上所闪耀出来的情感；对热爱良善的人而言，打动他们的，是在人的脸上所看到的对良善的情感，并且这情感是照着存在于他们所爱之善里面的纯真的量而打动他们。因此，激发他们情感的，是属世之物里面的属灵之物，而不是缺乏属灵之物的属世之物。同样，热爱良善的人会被小孩子所感染；在他们眼里，小孩子照着存在于其表情和言行举止中的仁爱纯真而显得美丽。正是良善与仁爱赋予美丽形式，并构成美丽（参看<a href="553.htm">553</a>节）。因此，“那少女容貌极其俊美”表有良善在里面的真理情感的美丽。</p>

And the damsel was exceeding good to look upon. That this signifies the beauty of the affection of truth, is evident from the signification of a "damsel," as being an affection in which is innocence 
(see n. 3067). That "exceeding good to look upon" signifies beauty (here the beauty of the affection of truth, because it is said of the damsel) comes from the fact that all beauty is from good in which 
there is innocence. Good itself when it flows in from the internal man into the external, makes beauty; and from this is all human beauty. This may likewise be seen from the fact that no one is affected 
by the face of another, but by the affection which beams forth from the face; and that they who are in good are affected by the affection of good which is there, and in the measure in which there 
is innocence in the good. Thus it is the spiritual in the natural which affects, but not the natural without the spiritual. In like manner they who are in good are affected by little children, who appear 
to them beautiful in proportion to the innocence of charity in their faces, gestures, and speech. (That goodness and charity are what form and cause beauty, may be seen above, n. 553.) Hence then 
it is that the "damsel exceeding good to look upon" signifies the beauty of the affection of truth in which there is good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3080</b></p><p><b>3080.</b>
'And the girl was very good rooking' means the beauty of the affection for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a girl' as affection that has innocence within it, dealt with in <a href="3067.htm">3067</a>. The reason 
'very good looking' means beauty, in this case the beauty of the affection for truth since it is called 'a girl', is that all beauty comes from good in which innocence is present. When flowing in from 
the internal man into the external man good itself constitutes that which is beautiful. This is the source of all human beauty. This may be recognized also from the fact that it is not a person's face 
but the affection shining out of it that stirs the feelings in another; and in the case of those who love what is good it is the affection for good seen in a person's face that stirs them, which it 
does in the measure that innocence is present in the good which they love. Thus it is the spiritual within the natural that stirs their affections, not the natural devoid of the spiritual. In a similar 
way the feelings of those who love what is good are stirred by young children whom they see as beautiful in the measure that the innocence which goes with charity is present in the children's faces, 
actions, and speech. It is goodness and charity that give form to and constitute beauty, see <a href="553.htm">553</a>; and that is why 'the girl was very good looking' means the beauty of the affection for truth that has 
good within it. </p>

`Et puella bona aspectu valde': quod significet affectionis veri pulchritudinem, constat a significatione `puellae' quod sit affectio in qua innocentia, de qua n. 3067: `bona aspectu valde' quod significet 
pulchritudinem, hic affectionis veri quia `puella' dicitur, inde est quia omnis pulchritudo est a bono in quo innocens; ipsum bonum cum ex interno homine influit in externum, facit pulchrum, omne 
humanum pulchrum est inde: hoc quoque constare potest ex eo quod non afficiatur quisquam ex facie alicujus, sed ex affectione quae elucet ex facie; et quod illi qui in bono sunt, afficiantur ex affectione 
boni quae ibi, ac in tantum, quantum innocentiae est in bono; ita est spirituale in naturali quod afficit, non autem naturale absque spirituali; similiter illi qui in bono sunt, ab infantibus, 
qui illis in tantum pulchri apparent, in quantum innocentia charitatis est in facie, gestu, loquela: quod bonitas et charitas sit quae format et (x)facit pulchrum, videatur n. 553: inde nunc est quod 
`puella bona aspectu valde' significet pulchritudinem affectionis veri in quo bonum. </p>
