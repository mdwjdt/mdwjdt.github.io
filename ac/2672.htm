Verse 14. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave to Hagar, and put them on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away, and she went and wandered in 
the wilderness of Beersheba. "Abraham rose early in the morning," signifies the Lord's clear perception from the Divine; "and took bread and a bottle of water," signifies good and truth; "and gave to 
Hagar," signifies implantation in its life; "and put them on her shoulder," signifies as much as it could receive; "and the child," signifies spiritual truth; "and sent her away," signifies that he left 
it in what is their own; "and she went and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba" signifies a state of wandering in the doctrinal things of faith. </p>

Verse 14 And in the morning Abraham rose up early, and took bread and a flask of water, and gave them to Hagar. He put them on her shoulder, and the boy, and sent her away; and she went and wandered 
in the wilderness of Beersheba. </p>
<p>'In the morning Abraham rose up early' means the Lord's clear perception from the Divine. 'And he took bread and a flask of water' means good and truth. 'And gave them 
to Hagar' means implantation within the life of the exterior man. 'And he put them on her shoulder' means as much as the exterior man was able to receive. 'And the boy' means spiritual truth. 'And 
sent her away' means that He left the exterior man immersed in the proprium. 'And she went and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba' means a state of wandering from one position to another in matters 
of doctrine regarding faith. </p>

Vers. 14.  Et mane surrexit Abraham in matutino, et accepit panem et lagenam aquae, et dedit ad Hagar, posuit super humero ejus, et puerum, et emisit illam, et ivit et erravit in deserto Beersheba. 
`Mane surrexit Abraham in matutino' significat perceptionem claram Domini a Divino: `et accepit panem et lagenam aquae' significat bonum et verum: `et dedit ad Hagar' significat implantationem in vita 
ejus: `et posuit super humero ejus' significat quantum posset recipere: `et puerum' significat verum spirituale: `et emisit illam' significat quod in proprio relinqueret: `et ivit et erravit in deserto 
Beersheba' significat statum erraticum in doctrinalibus fidei. </p>
