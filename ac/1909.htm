<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1909节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1909.</strong>“亚伯兰与夏甲同房”表内在人与记忆知识情感生命的融合。这从“夏甲”的含义清楚可知，前面说明（16:1），“夏甲”表示外层人或属世人的生命。该生命是记忆知识情感的生命，这从“埃及婢女”的含义明显看出来，如前所述。属于外层人的情感有很多，各自都致力于自己的功用。然而，当以人变得真正理性为目的时，认知和知识的情感胜过一切，因为此时它以善与真为自己的目的。内在人的生命本身流入属世人的一切情感，但在那里因目的而各异。当它流入以这个世界为目的的情感时，这目的就被那生命复活，在那里产生世俗的生命。当它流入以自我为目的的情感时，这目的就被那生命复活，在那里产生肉体的生命。流入其它所有情感的情形也一样。正因如此，恶欲和谬念也有生命，不过，这生命违背善与真的情感。<br />当生命流入时，它仅指向目的。因为对每个人来说，其目的就是他的爱，唯独爱活着。其它一切不过是衍生物，全都从这目的汲取自己的生命。只要找出自己的目的是什么，谁都能看出自己具有哪种生命。他不用寻查其一切目的的性质，因为这些目的不计其数，和他的意图一样多，也几乎和判断，以及思考的结论一样多。这些目的仅仅是源于主要目的，或倾向于主要目的的次要目的。只是让他寻查他首选，并且与之相比其它所有目的如同没有的目的。若他以自我和这个世界为目的，就叫他知道他的生命是属地狱的；但若他以其邻舍的利益、公众利益、主的国度，尤其以主自己为目的，就叫他知道他的生命是属天堂的。</p>

He went in unto Hagar. That this signifies the conjunction of the internal man with the life which is of the affection of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "Hagar," as being the 
life of the exterior or natural man (explained above at verse 1) and that this life is the life of the affection of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of the "Egyptian handmaid" (also 
explained above). There are many affections belonging to the exterior man, all dedicated to their uses; but the affection of knowledges [cognitiones et scientiae] stands preeminent above them all, 
when it has for its end that we may become truly rational, for thus it has good and truth for its end. The very life of the internal man flows into all the affections of the natural man, but is varied 
there according to the ends; when it flows into affections which have the world for their end, this end is vivified by that life, and there results worldly life; when into affections which have self 
for their end, this end is vivified by that life, and there results corporeal life; and so in all other cases. It is from this that cupidities and phantasies live, but a life contrary to the affection 
of good and truth.  [2] The inflowing life is applied to no other object than the end, because with everyone his end is his love, and it is the love alone that lives. All other objects are only derivations 
from this, and they all draw their life from the end. Everyone may see what kind of life he has, if he will only search out what his end is; not what all his ends are-for he has numberless ones, 
as many as intentions, and almost as many as judgments and conclusions of thoughts, which are only intermediate ends, variously derived from the principal one, or tending to it-but let him search out 
the end he prefers to all the rest, and in respect to which all others are as nothing. If he has for his end himself and the world, let him know that his life is infernal; but if he has for his end 
the good of his neighbor, the common good, the Lord's kingdom, and especially the Lord Himself, let him know that his life is heavenly. </p>

That 'he went in to Hagar' means the joining of the internal man to the life of the affection for knowledge is clear from the meaning of 'Hagar' as the life of the exterior or natural man, dealt with 
above at verse 1; and that this life is the life of the affection for knowledge is clear from the meaning of 'an Egyptian servant-girl', also dealt with above. There are many affections belonging to 
the exterior man, each one devoted to its own use. Superior to them all however is the affection for cognitions and knowledge when its end in view is that a person may become truly rational, for it then 
has good and truth as its end in view. The life itself of the internal man flows into all the affections of the natural man, but there it varies according to ends in view. When it flows into affections 
which have the world as the end in view, that end receives life from that life which is flowing in, and becomes worldly- minded life. When it flows into affections that have self as the end in view, 
that end receives life from that life which is flowing in, and becomes bodily-minded life. And so it is with all the other affections when life flows into them. It is from this that evil desires and 
false notions have life, but a life contrary to the affection for good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As it flows in, life is not directed towards anything except the end in view, for with everyone that end is 
his love, and it is love alone which is living. All else in him is purely derivative, getting its life from the end in view. Anyone may see what kind of life he possesses, if only he will find out what 
kind of end he has in view. He does not have to find out the nature of all his ends, for these are countless, as many as his intentions and almost as many as the judgements and conclusions arrived at 
by his thoughts. These are merely secondary ends derived from the main one or tending towards it. All he has to find out is the end which he prefers above all others, and in comparison with which all 
others are as nothing. If he has self and the world as his end, let him recognize that his life is that of hell; but if he has the good of the neighbour, the common good, the Lord's kingdom, and above 
all the Lord Himself as his end, let him recognize that his life is that of heaven. </p>

`Ingressus ad Hagarem': quod significet conjunctionem interni hominis cum vita quae est affectionis scientiarum, constat ex significatione `Hagaris' quod sit vita hominis exterioris seu naturalis, de 
qua supra ad vers. 1; quae vita quod sit vita affectionis scientiarum, constat a significatione `ancillae Aegyptiae,' de qua etiam supra.  Sunt plures affectiones exterioris {1} hominis, omnes suis 
usibus dicatae, sed prae omnibus illis praestat affectio cognitionum et scientiarum, cum pro fine habet ut vere rationalis fiat, nam sic pro fine habet bonum et verum.  Ipsa vita interni hominis influit 
in omnes affectiones hominis naturalis, sed ibi secundum fines variatur; cum in affectiones quae pro fine habent mundum, vivificatur finis hic a vita illa et fit vita mundana; cum in affectiones quae 
pro fine habent semet, finis hic vivificatur a vita illa et fit vita corporea, ita cum reliquis; inde est quod cupiditates et phantasiae vivant sed vitam contrariam affectioni boni et veri: [2] vita 
influens non applicatur alii objecto quam fini, quia finis unicuique est ejus amor, et amor unice est qui vivit; cetera objecta sunt modo derivationes inde quae vitam suam trahunt a fine: quisque videre 
potest qualem vitam habet, modo exploret qualem finem; non quales fines, nam innumerabiles sunt, nempe quot intentiones et fere quot cogitationum judicia et conclusa, sed haec sunt fines intermedii 
qui a principali varie derivantur vel ad illum tendunt, at exploret finem quem reliquis praefert, et cujus respectu reliqui sicut nihil sunt: si pro fine habet semet et mundum, sciat quod infernalis 
sit; si autem pro fine habet bonum proximi, bonum commune, regnum Domini, imprimis Ipsum Dominum, sciat quod caelestis sit. 	@1 A d externi, i exterioris.$ </p>
