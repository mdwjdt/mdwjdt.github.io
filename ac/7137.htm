<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7137节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7137.</strong>“就是法老的督工所立来管理他们的”表那些被侵扰者所引入的人。这从“所立来管理他们”和“督工”的含义清楚可知：“所立来管理他们”是指被引入，因为所发生的事是由下面所描述的引入完成的；“督工”是指那些进行侵扰的人（参看<a href="7111.htm">7111</a>节）。若不经历诸如来世所发生的那种事，就无从知道这一切是怎么回事。前面说过，“督工”表示那些最近距离地侵扰之人，而“官长”是指那些最近距离地接受并传递之人（<a href="7111.htm">7111</a>节）。那些最近距离地接受并传递之人是简单而正直的灵人，他们主要履行这种服务，或说服务于这种功用。侵扰者通过唯有来世才知道的巧妙方法，将这些灵人引入一个社群，这个社群是他们为自己所预备的交流渠道。这一切是由那些“督工”所表示的、进行侵扰的人完成的；地狱以这种方式在自己那一边建立起一个交流的渠道，而那些正在被侵扰的人也有一个自己的渠道。我即便没有上千次，也有上百次见过这种事了，而且还经历了。由此明显可知，若不经历诸如来世所发生的那种事，就无从知道这些话在内义上是什么意思。</p>

Whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them. That this signifies those who were injected by the infesters, is evident from the signification of "being set over them," as being to be injected, because 
done by injection (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "taskmasters," as being those who infest (see n. 7111). How this is cannot be known except from experience with such in the 
other life. It was said above that by "taskmasters" are signified those who most closely infest, and by "officers" those who most closely receive and communicate (n. 7111); they who thus receive and 
communicate are simple, upright spirits, who are of especial service for such a use; these spirits, by means of arts known only in the other life, are injected by the infesters toward the society with 
which they thus procure for themselves communication; and this is effected by those who infest and are signified by the "taskmasters;" thus the hells have communication on their side, and they who are 
being infested on theirs. That this is the case, I have seen a hundred times, if not a thousand, and have also experienced. From all this it is evident that what is signified by these words in the 
internal sense cannot be known except from experience concerning such things in the other life. </p>

'Whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them' means those who were introduced by the ones who were the molesters. This is clear from the meaning of 'setting over them' as being introduced, for what 
happens is accomplished by the kind of introduction described below; and from the meaning of 'the taskmasters' as those who molest, dealt with in <a href="7111.htm">7111</a>. What is implied here cannot be known without experience 
of the kinds of things that go on in the next life. It has been stated above that 'the taskmasters' means those in the nearest position to molest, and that 'the officers' means those in the nearest 
position to receive things and pass them on, see <a href="7111.htm">7111</a>. Those in the nearest position to receive things and pass them on are simple but upright spirits who perform primarily this kind of service. 
By skillful methods known only in the next life the molesters introduce them into a community with which they are preparing a channel of communication for themselves. This is done by those who molest 
and who are meant by 'the taskmasters'. In this way the hells establish a channel of communication from their side, and those who are being molested have a channel from theirs. I have seen that this 
is so a hundred if not a thousand times, and have also had experience of it. From all this it is evident that no one can know what the meaning of these words is in the internal sense without experience 
of the kinds of things that go on in the next life. </p>

</p><b>7137.</b>
`Quos posuerunt super illos exactores Pharaonis': quod significet illos qui ab infestatoribus injecti sunt, constat ex significatione ponere super illos' quod sit injici, quia fit per injectionem, de 
qua sequitur; et ex significatione `exactorum' quod sint {1}qui infestant, de qua n. 7111.  Quomodo hoc se habet, non sciri potest nisi ab experientia ex talibus in altera vita; dictum est supra quod 
per `exactores' significentur qui proxime infestant, et per `moderatores' qui proxime recipiunt et communicant, videatur n. 7111; illi qui proxime recipiunt et communicant sunt spiritus simplices probi 
qui pro tali usu imprimis inserviunt; hi ab infestatoribus, per artes in altera vita solum notas, injiciuntur ad societatem cum qua communicationem sibi parant, et hoc fit ab illis qui infestant et 
significantur per `exactores'; ita habent inferna {2}communicationem a sua parte, et illi qui infestantur {3}communicationem a sua; quod res ita se habeat, centies si non millies vidi, et quoque expertus 
sum.  Ex his patet quod non (x)sciri possit quid in sensu interno significatur per haec verba, nisi ab experientia de talibus in altera vita. 	@1 infestatores$ 	@2 quae infestant, communicationes 
(communicationem written first)$ 	@3 communicationem altered to communicationes$ </p>
