<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>223.</strong>“主的面”既表慈悲、平安、良善，那么显然，他看待任何人，都是本乎慈悲，从不转面不顾。转面的，是落入罪恶的人，正如经上说：“但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝，你们的罪恶使他向你们掩面。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.2.htm">59:2</a>）以及此处，“他们躲避耶和华的面，因为他们赤身露体”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]223.</strong> Since the Lord's face is mercy, peace, and everything good, it is clear that he never looks at anyone except with mercy and never turns his face from anyone. It is we, when we are wrapped up in evil, who turn our faces away. As the Lord said through Isaiah:<br />Your offenses are what cause a separation between you and your God; and your sins hide his face from you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_223/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_59_2" target=_top>Isaiah 59:2</a>)<br />Likewise it says here that they hid themselves from Jehovah's face because they were naked. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 223</b></p><p><b>223.</b>
As the "face of the Lord" is mercy, peace, and every good, it is evident that He regards all from mercy, and never averts His countenance from any; but that it is man, when in evil, who turns away his 
face, as is said by the Lord in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you (Isa. 59:2); and here, "they hid themselves from the face 
of Jehovah, because they were naked." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 223</b></p><p><b>223.</b>
Since the Lord's face is mercy, peace, and all good, it is clear that He always looks with mercy on anybody, and never turns His face away from anybody. Instead it is man, when governed by evil, who 
turns away his face, as the Lord has said through Isaiah,    Your iniquities are what separate you from your God, and your sins what cause His face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to hide from you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:2</a>.

</p><b>223.</b>
Cum Domini facies sit misericordia, pax et omne bonum, constat quod nusquam aliquem quam ex misericordia aspiciat; quod nusquam ab aliquo faciem avertat; sed quod homo sit cum malo, qui suam faciem 
avertit; ut a Domino per Esaiam dictum, 	Iniquitates vestrae sunt, quae separant inter vos, et inter Deum vestrum; et peccata vestra abscondere faciunt facies vobis, lix 2. Ita quoque hic, quod 'occultaverint 
se a facie Jehovae, quia nudi.'
