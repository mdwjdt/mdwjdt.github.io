<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10407节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10407</strong>.“把它铸成一只牛犊”表照着这个民族的爱之快乐。这从“一只牛犊”和“铸”的含义清楚可知：“一只牛犊”是指外在或属世良善，如下文所述；“铸”是指为支持外在的爱所执行的敬拜，如刚才所述（<a href="10406.htm">10406</a>节）。由于本章论述的主题是以色列民族，这个民族的兴趣在于外在事物，而非内在事物，因而被外在的爱主宰，所以才说“照着这个民族的爱之快乐”。“牛犊”因是一个偶像，故表示这种快乐。<br />处于代表性敬拜的古人知道各种动物或活物表示什么；因为每种动物或活物都有自己的灵义，它们照着这灵义而出现在天堂里，因而照着灵义在圣言中被提及，也照着灵义被用于燔祭和祭祀。“牛犊”表示外在人或属世人里面的纯真和仁爱的良善（<a href="9391.htm">9391</a>，<a href="9990.htm">9990</a>，<a href="10132.htm">10132</a>节）；但当纯真和仁爱的良善不存在时，如那些兴趣在于外在事物，不在内在事物之人的情形，“牛犊”就表示感官层面上的属世快乐，也就是属于人自己的愿望、欲望、自我之爱和尘世之爱的一种快乐。这种快乐就是存在于那些兴趣在于外在事物，而不在于内在事物的人身上的快乐，也是他们所敬拜的快乐；因为人会敬拜他爱之胜过一切的东西。诚然，他们说，他们拜的是创造一切的神，或宇宙之神，但他们只是在嘴上说，不是从心里说的。像这样的人就由那些敬拜铸造的牛犊之人来表示。<br />埃及人比其他所有人都更是这样。他们因比其它所有民族都更掌握对应和代表的知识，所以为自己制造了各种偶像，这从保存至今的埃及偶像明显看出来。但他们的主要偶像是牛犊，他们愿意这牛犊表示他们在敬拜中的外在良善。然而，当他们比其它民族都更精通的对应和代表的知识沦为邪术时，这牛犊就取了反面意义，也就是说，表示属于外在的爱的快乐。当一只牛犊被放在他们的圣殿，当作神明被敬拜时，它表示以敬拜来表达的这种快乐。<br />由于以色列民族将这种偶像崇拜行为从埃及带出来，所以就他们的牛犊而言，当他们拜一只牛犊为神明时，这牛犊就表示属于他们的爱并以敬拜来表达的快乐。至于他们的爱是何品质，这可从前面（<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>节）提到的地方所作的说明看出来。因为他们那时和如今一样，比其他所有人都更被自我之爱和尘世之爱主宰。众所周知，如今他们被一种最世俗的爱主宰，因为他们爱银爱金不是为了任何功用，而是为了银子、金子本身，这种爱是最世俗的，因为它是肮脏的贪婪。对他们来说，自我之爱不是显而易见的，而是藏在他们心里，如所有贪得无厌之人通常的情形。这也是众所周知的，即：他们没有对邻舍的爱；人越缺乏对邻之爱，自我之爱就存在于他里面。由此可见亚伦为这个民族所铸的牛犊表示什么。<br />下列经文中的“牛犊”所表相同，耶利米书：<br />埃及是肥美的母牛犊，但出于北方的毁灭来到了！她中间的雇佣好像圈里的肥牛犊。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.20.htm">46:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.21.htm">21</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他们在何烈山造了牛犊，叩拜铸像；他们将荣耀变成那吃草的牛像。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.19.htm">106:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.20.htm">20</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />现今他们罪越犯越多，用银子照自己的聪明为自己制造铸像，就是偶像，完全是匠人的工作。对他们说，那些献人祭的人亲吻牛犊。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.2.htm">13:2</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />野牛和它们、牛犊和公牛壮牛要一同下来；他们的地要喝醉了血；他们的尘土因脂油肥润。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.7.htm">34:7</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />坚固城变为凄凉，成了撇下离弃的居所，像旷野一样；牛犊必在那里吃草，在那里躺卧，并吃尽其树枝。它的庄稼必枯萎。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.10.htm">27:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.11.htm">11</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />求你叱喝万民牛犊当中芦苇的野兽和壮牛群，践踏银块。他们已经赶散万民。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.30.htm">68:30</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我必把那些违犯我的约的人交出去；他们没有履行在我面前和我立约的话，就是他们把牛犊劈开两半，好从两半中间经过时立下的；就是犹大的首领、耶路撒冷的首领、宫中的臣宰、祭司和从牛犊两半中间经过的这地的众民。我必将他们交在仇敌手中，他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的走兽作食物。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.18.htm">34:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.20.htm">20</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />他们立君王，却不由我；他们立首领，我却不知道。他们用金银为自己制造偶像，以致被剪除。撒马利亚啊！你的牛犊已经离弃你。这牛犊出于以色列，是工匠所造的，并不是神！撒马利亚的牛犊必被打碎。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.4.htm">8:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这些经文的解释可参看前文（<a href="9391.htm">9391</a>节）。</p>

And made it a molten calf. That this signifies according to the delight of the loves of that nation, is evident from the signification of "a calf," as being external or natural good (of which below); 
and from the signification of "molten," as being worship performed in favor of external loves (of which just above, n. 10406). And as the Israelitish nation is the subject treated of in this chapter, 
and that nation was in externals without an internal, thus in external loves, therefore it is said, "according to the delight of the loves of that nation;" for by a "calf" as an idol is signified this 
delight. [2] The ancients, who were in representative worship, knew what was signified by the various kinds of animals; for each animal has its signification, and according to this they appear in heaven, 
consequently according to this they are mentioned in the Word, and also according to this they were employed in burnt-offerings and sacrifices. By a "calf" is signified the good of innocence and 
of charity in the external or natural man (n. 9391, 9990, 10132); but when there is no good of innocence and of charity, as is the case with those who are in externals without what is internal, then 
by a "calf" is signified natural and sensuous delight, which is the delight of pleasures, of cupidities, and of the loves of self and of the world. It is this delight in which are those who are in externals 
without an internal, and which they worship, for a man worships that which he loves above all things. They do indeed say that they worship the God of the universe, but they say this with the mouth 
and not with the heart. Such persons are meant by those who worship a molten calf.  [3] The Egyptians were such above all others, and they, being in the science of correspondences and of representations 
above all other nations, consequently made for themselves various idols, as is evident from the Egyptian idols which remain to this day. But their chief idol was a calf, whereby they wished to 
signify their external good in worship. When, however, the science of correspondence and of representations, wherein they were versed above others, was turned among them into magic, then a calf put 
on the opposite signification, which is the delight of external loves; and when a calf was placed in their temples and worshiped as a god, it signified such a delight in worship. [4] As the Israelitish 
nation brought with it from Egypt this idolatrous thing, therefore as applied to that nation, when a calf was worshiped by them as a god, it signified the delight of the loves of that nation in worship. 
Of what quality their loves were can be seen from what was shown in the places cited above (n. 10396); for they were then, as they are at this day, in the love of self and in the love of the world 
above all others. It is known that at this day they are in a love most earthly, for they love silver and gold not for the sake of any use, but for the sake of the silver and gold itself, which love 
is of all loves the most earthly, for it is sordid avarice. The love of self is not conspicuous with them so as to appear; but lies hidden within their hearts, as is usual with all who are sordidly avaricious. 
It is also known that they have no love of the neighbor; and insofar as there is no love of the neighbor with anyone, so far the love of self is in him. From this it can now be seen what is 
signified by the molten calf made by Aaron for that nation. [5] The like is signified by a "calf" in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Egypt is a very fair calf; destruction cometh out of the north, and 
her hired men in the midst of her are like fatted calves of the stall (Jer. 46:20, 21).      They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed themselves unto the molten image, and they changed their glory into 
the likeness of an ox that eateth herbage (Ps. 106:19, 20).      They sin more and more, and make them a molten image from their silver, idols in their own intelligence, all of them the work of the artificers; 
speaking to them; they sacrifice a man, they kiss the calves (Hos. 13:2).      The unicorns shall come down with them, and the calves with the strong ones; and their land shall be drunken 
with blood, and their dust shall be made fat with fatness (Isa. 34:7).      The fenced city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and 
shall consume the branches thereof, and the harvest thereof shall wither (Isa. 27:10, 11).      [6] Rebuke the wild beast of the reed, the congregation of the strong ones, among the calves of the peoples, 
trampling on the pieces of silver; he hath scattered the peoples (Ps. 68:30).      I will give the men that have transgressed My covenant, who have not established the words of the covenant which 
they struck before Me, of the calf which they cut in twain that they might pass between the parts thereof; the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the royal ministers, and the priests, 
and all the people of the land, that pass between the parts of the calf; and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, that their carcass may be food to the fowl of the heavens and to the beast 
of the earth (Jer. 34:18-20).      They have made a king, but not by Me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; their silver and their gold have they made idols, that it may be cut off. Thy calf 
hath deserted, O Samaria. For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no god; for the calf of Samaria shall come to pieces (Hos. 8:4-6). All these passages may be seen unfolded above 
(n. 9391). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10407</b></p><p><b>10407.</b>
'And made out of it a calf of molded [metal]' means in keeping with the delight belonging to that nation's loves. This is clear from the meaning of 'a calf' as external or natural good, dealt with below; 
and from the meaning of 'molded [metal]' as worship fashioned in support of external kinds of love, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10406.htm">10406</a>. And since the Israelite nation is the subject in the present 
chapter and that nation's interest lay in external things and not in what was internal, and so was ruled by external kinds of love, the expression 'in keeping with the delight belonging to that nation's 
loves' is used. For 'the calf', being an idol, means that delight.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The ancients among whom representative worship existed knew what the various kinds of living creatures were the signs 
of; for the living creatures each have their own spiritual meaning, and their spiritual meanings govern the manifestations of such creatures in heaven as well, consequently the mention of them in the 
Word, and also their use in burnt offerings and sacrifices. 'A calf' means the good of innocence and charity within the external or natural man, see <a href="9391.htm">9391</a>, <a href="9990.htm">9990</a>, <a href="10132.htm">10132</a>; but when no good of innocence and 
charity is present, as is the case with those whose interest lies in external things and not in what is internal, 'a calf' means natural delight on the level of the senses, which is a delight belonging 
to a person's own wishes, desires, self-love, and love of the world. This delight is the one that exists with those whose interest lies in external things and not in what is internal, and the one 
they worship; for what a person loves above all things, that he worships. They say, it is true, that they worship the God of all creation; but they say it with their lips and not their heart. People 
such as these are meant by those who worship the calf of molded [metal].  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Egyptians were such more than all others. Because they possessed a greater knowledge of correspondences and representations 
than all other nations they made various idols for themselves, as is evident from the Egyptian idols that are still in existence. But their chief idol was the calf, by which they wished to signify 
their external good within worship. But when their knowledge of correspondences and representations, which was greater than that of other nations, was turned into magic, the calf took on a contrary 
meaning, namely that of the delight belonging to external kinds of love. And when the calf was placed in temples and worshipped as a god it meant that kind of delight expressed in worship.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
Because the Israelite nation brought that idolatrous practice with them out of Egypt, in their case the calf, when worshipped by them as a god, means the delight belonging to their particular loves expressed 
in worship. What kind of loves these were may be recognized from what has been shown in the places referred to above in <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>. For they were ruled, as they are at the present day, by self-love 
and love of the world more than all others. It is well known that at the present day they are ruled by a most earthly kind of love; for they love silver and gold not because of any use these can serve 
but for the sake of silver and gold themselves. This love is the most earthly of all, for it is foul avarice. With them self-love is not plainly visible but lies hidden in their heart, as is normally 
so with all who are foully avaricious. It is well known too that no love of the neighbour exists with them; and to the extent that love of the neighbour is absent from someone, self-love resides in 
him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this it now becomes clear what the calf of molded [metal] made by Aaron for that nation means. The like is meant by it in the following places: In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
A very beautiful 
heifer was Egypt; destruction has come from the north.

</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
They made a calf in Horeb and 
bowed down to the molded image; and they changed the glory into the effigy of the ox that eats the plant<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20106:19,20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 106:19,20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
They sin more and more, and make for themselves a molded 
image from their silver, idols by their own intelligence, completely the work of craftsmen, saying to them, Those who offer human sacrifice<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> kiss the calves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The unicorns 
will come down with them, and the calves with the powerful ones; and their land will become drunk with blood, and their dust will be made fat with fatness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2034:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 34:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The 
fortified city will be solitary, a habitation forsaken and left [like a wilderness]; there the calf will feed, and there it will lie down and consume its branches. And its harvest will wither. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2027:10,11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 27:10,11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, the congregation of the strong ones, among the calves of the peoples, trampling on the fragments of silver. They have scattered the 
peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:30</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will give the men who transgressed My covenant, who did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before Me, that of the calf which they cut in two, 
in order that they might pass between its parts - the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the royal ministers and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts 
of the calf - I will give them into the hand of their enemies, that their dead bodies may be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2034:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 34:18-20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
They have made 
a king, and not by Me; they have made princes, and I did not know. Their silver and their gold they have made into idols, that they may be cut off. Your calf has deserted [you], O Samaria. For from 
Israel is this also. A smith has made it, and it is not God; for the calf of Samaria will be broken to<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> pieces. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%208:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 8:4-6</a>.

`Et fecit illud vitulum fusilis': quod significet secundum jucundum amorum illius gentis, constat ex significatione `vituli' quod sit bonum externum seu naturale, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione 
`fusilis' quod sit cultus factus ad favorem amorum externorum, de qua mox supra n. 10,406; et quia de gente Israelitica in hoc capite agitur, et illa erat in externis absque interno, ita in amoribus 
{1}externis, ideo dicitur secundum jucundum amorum illius gentis; per `vitulum' enim, {2}ut idolum, significatur id jucundum. 	[2] Antiqui qui in cultu repraesentativo erant sciebant quid per varia 
genera animalium significabatur, nam quodlibet animal significationem suam habet, secundum quam etiam apparent in caelo, consequenter secundum quam nominantur in Verbo, et quoque secundum quam adhibita 
fuerunt in holocaustis et sacrificiis; per `vitulum' significatur bonum innocentiae et charitatis in externo seu naturali homine, videatur n. 9391, 9990, 10,132; at cum non {3} bonum innocentiae et 
charitatis est, ut apud illos qui in externis sunt absque interno, tunc per `vitulum' significatur jucundum naturale et sensuale, quod jucundum est jucundum voluptatum, cupiditatum, (c)et amorum sui 
et mundi; {4}hoc jucundum est in quo illi qui in externis absque interno sunt, et quod colunt, nam homo quod amat super omnia, hoc colit; (t)quidem dicunt quod colant Deum universi, sed hoc {5}dicunt 
ore et non corde; qui tales sunt intelliguntur per illos qui colunt vitulum fusilis. 	[3] Aegyptii prae aliis fuerunt tales qui quia in scientia correspondentiarum et repraesentationum erant prae aliis 
gentibus, ideo sibi varia idola fecerunt, ut patet ex idolis Aegyptiacis quae adhuc exstant; sed primarium illis idolum fuit vitulus, per quem significare volebant bonum externum eorum in cultu; sed 
cum scientia correspondentiarum et repraesentationum, in qua erant prae aliis, apud illos versa fuit in magiam, tunc vitulus induebat significationem contrariam, quae est jucundi amorum externorum; 
et cum vitulus in templis ponebatur, et pro deo colebatur, significabat tale jucundum in cultu; gens Israelitica [4] quia ex Aegypto secum ferebat idololatricum illud, ideo applicate ad illam gentem per 
vitulum, cum pro deo ab illis colebatur, significatur jucundum amorum illius gentis in cultu; quales ejus amores fuerunt, constare potest ex illis quae ostensa sunt in locis citatis supra n. 10,396; 
fuerunt enim tunc sicut hodie, in amore sui et in amore mundi prae omnibus aliis; quod hodie sint in amore maxime terrestri, notum est, amant enim argentum et aurum non propter aliquem usum sed propter 
ipsum argentum et aurum, qui amor est omnium maxime terrestris, nam est sordida avaritia; amor sui non exstat apud illos, ut appareat, sed latet intus in corde eorum, ut solet apud omnes sordide avaros; 
quod nullus amor proximi {6}apud illos sit, etiam notum est, et quantum nullus amor proximi est apud aliquem, tantum est ei amor sui. 	[5] Ex his nunc constare potest quid per vitulum fusilis 
ab Aharone pro gente illa factum significatur; simile per illum {7}significatur in his locis: apud Jeremiam, 	Vitula pulcherrima Aegyptus, excidium e septentrione venit, ac mercenarii ejus in medio ejus 
sicut vituli saginarii, xlvi 20, 21: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Fecerunt vitulum in Chorebo, et incurvaverunt se fusili, et permutarunt gloriam in effigiem bovis comedentis herbam, Ps. cvi 19, 20: </p>

peccare, et faciunt sibi fusile ex argento suo, in intelligentia sua idola, opus artificum totum, illis dicentes, Sacrificant hominem, vitulos osculantur, xiii 2: </p>

unicornes cum illis, et {8}vituli cum robustis, et ebria fiet terra eorum a sanguine, et pulvis eorum ab adipe pinguefiet, xxxiv 7: </p>

derelictum, ibi pascet vitulus, et ibi cubabit, et consumet ramos ejus, et exarescet messis ejus, xxvii 10 [,11]: </p>
<p>[6] apud Davidem, 	Increpa feram (x)arundinis, congregationem fortium, inter vitulos 
populorum, conculcans fragmenta argenti, dispersit populos, Ps. lxviii 31 [A.V. 30]: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Dabo viros transgressos foedus Meum, qui non stabiliverunt verba foederis, quod ferierunt coram 
Me, vituli, quem conciderunt in duas, ut transirent inter partes ejus, principes Jehudae, et principes Hierosolymae, ministros regios, et sacerdotes, et omnem populum terrae, transeuntes inter partes 
vituli; et dabo illos in manum hostium illorum, ut sit cadaver eorum in cibum avi caelorum et bestiae terrae, xxxiv 18-20: </p>
