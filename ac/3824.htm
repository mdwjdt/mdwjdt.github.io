<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3824节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3824.</strong>“就说，我愿为你小女儿拉结服事你七年”表在神圣状态下所作出的勤奋努力，以便它能与内在真理结合。这从“服事”、“七”和“年”的含义清楚可知：“服事”是指勤奋努力；“七”是指神圣之物（参看<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）；“年”是指状态（<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）。谁都能看出，这种努力旨在使这二者可以结合起来。从这些含义明显可知，“我愿为你小女儿拉结服事你七年”表示在神圣状态下所作出的勤奋努力，以便它能与内在真理结合。<br />当学习、承认并相信内在真理时，可以说内在真理便与属世层相结合。人的属世层，也就是他的属世记忆里既有外在真理，也有内在真理。它们以宗教知识的形式居于那里，但在此人因将它们运用于生活，也就是生活才是他之所以爱它们的原因而拥有对它们的情感之前，它们不会与属世人结合。因为当达到这个阶段时，良善就会与这些真理结合，它们凭借这良善与理性层结合，从而与内在人结合。生命通过这种途径从主流入它们。</p>

And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. That this signifies study, and at the same time a holy state, in order to be conjoined with internal truth, is evident from 
the signification of "serving," as being study; and from the signification of "seven," as being that which is holy (see n. 395, 433, 716, 881); and from the signification of "years," as being states 
(n. 487, 488, 493, 893); that this was in order to conjunction is evident. Hence it is manifest that by "I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter," signifies study, and at the same 
time a holy state in order to be conjoined with internal truth. Internal truths are said to be conjoined with the natural when they are learned, acknowledged, and believed. In the natural of man, that 
is, in the memory of this man, there are truths both external and internal, and they are there in the form of memorized doctrinal things; but they have not been conjoined until the man is affected 
with them for the sake of the use of life, that is, until they are loved for the sake of life; for then good is coupled with them, whereby they are conjoined with the rational, consequently with the internal 
man. In this way there is an influx of life into them from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3824</b></p><p><b>3824.</b>
'And said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter' means a diligent effort, to be made during a holy state, to the end that it might be joined to internal truth. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'serving' as a diligent effort; from the meaning of 'seven' as that which is holy, dealt with in <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>; and from the meaning of 'years' as states, dealt with in <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>. And as anyone may see, such effort was so that the two might be joined together. From these meanings it is evident that 'I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter' means 
a diligent effort, to be made during a holy state, to the end that it might be joined to internal truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Internal truths are said to be joined to the natural when they are learned, acknowledged, 
and believed. Within man's natural, that is, within his natural memory, both external and internal truths are present. These reside there as religious knowledge, but they have not been joined to 
the natural man until that person has an affection for them because they have application to his life, that is, life is the reason why he loves them. For when this stage is reached good is coupled to 
those truths, and by means of that good they are joined to the rational and so to the internal man. By this route life enters into them from the Lord. </p>

</p><b>3824.</b>
`Et dixit, Serviam tibi septem annis pro Rachele filia tua minore':  quod significet studium et tunc statum sanctum ut cum interno vero conjungeretur, constat a significatione `servire' quod sit 
studium; a significatione `septem' quod sit sanctum, de qua n. 395, 433, 716, 881; et ex significatione `annorum' quod sint status, de qua n. 487, 488, 493, 893; quod sit propter conjunctionem, constat; 
inde patet quod per `serviam tibi septem annis pro Rachele filia tua minore' significetur studium et tunc status sanctus ut cum interno vero conjungeretur.  [2]Interna vera conjungi naturali 
dicuntur cum discuntur, agnoscuntur et creduntur; </p>
<p>in naturali hominis seu in hujus memoria sunt vera tam externa quam interna, et ibi ut scientifica doctrinalia, sed non prius conjuncta sunt quam cum 
homo illis propter usum vitae afficitur, seu propter vitam amantur, nam tunc bonum illis copulatur, per quod conjunguntur cum rationali, proinde cum interno homine; per hanc viam est influxus vitae 
in illa a Domino. </p>
