<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8458节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8458.</strong>“有一样小圆物”表最初形式的真理之良善。这从“小”和“圆”的含义清楚可知：“小”论及真理；“圆”论及良善。因此，“小圆物”论及真理之良善。存在于属灵教会成员身上的良善被称为“真理之良善”；这种良善不仅始于真理，而且本质上就是真理。它被人视为真理，但被感觉为良善。因此，它作为真理形成心智的理解力部分，作为良善形成新的意愿部分。因为一个人的理解力因以下事实而有别于意愿：理解力将事物以一个形式呈现给自己，以便它能如在光中那样看见它们；而意愿则形成对它们的一种情感，以便它能同时感觉它们是一种快乐，因而是良善，并且照着这个形式的品质而如此行。“小”论及真理，“圆”论及良善，这一点可追溯到真理和良善在来世的显现。当真理和良善以一种可见的形式呈现出来时，如它们在来世以一种清晰、可感知的方式呈现在灵人和天使眼前那样，真理就以一定的数量呈现出来，因而照着真理的性质而呈现为某种或大或小的事物。此外，真理还呈现为某种棱角形的东西；也呈现为某种白色事物。但那里的良善以不确定的数量呈现出来，因而不是呈现为某种或大或小的事物。良善也呈现为某种圆形物，呈现为一种不间断的形状，在颜色上呈现为蓝、黄、红。当良善和真理显为可见时，它们就呈现出这些不同的表象，因为它们在本质上是不同的；当任何一个的本质变得可见时，它就以一种刚才所描述的属世形式来表达并表现自己。正因如此，世界上类似这些形式的事物要么表示真理，要么表示良善，因为就其本质而言，宇宙中不存在与良善或真理无关的东西。</p>

A small round thing. That this signifies the good of truth in its first formation, is evident from the signification of "small," as being predicated of truth; and from the signification of "round," as 
being predicated of good; consequently "a small round thing" is predicated of the good of truth. The good with the man of the spiritual church is called "the good of truth," and is truth not only as 
to origin, but also as to essence. It is seen as truth, but it is felt as good. Consequently as truth it forms the intellectual part of the mind, and as good it forms the new will part. For in man the 
intellectual part is distinguished from the will part by the fact that the intellectual part presents to itself things in a form, and so that it may see them as in the light, whereas the will part is 
affected by them so that it simultaneously feels them as delight, thus as good, and this according to the quality of the form. That "small" is predicated of truth, and "round" of good, has its cause 
in the manifestations of truth and of good in the other life. When truths and goods are presented in a visible form, as they are in the other life openly before the eyes of spirits and angels, then truth 
is presented in a discrete quantity, consequently as much or as little, according to the quality of the truth; truth is also presented as angular in various forms, and it is also presented as white. 
But good is there presented in a continuous quantity, thus not as much or as little; good is also presented as round, which is continuous in form; and in color as blue, yellow, and red. That when 
good and truth are presented to view they appear in this way, comes from their difference as to quality, which when it becomes visible thus expresses and represents itself in a natural form. Hence it 
is that things which in the world approach such forms signify either truths or goods, for there is nothing in the universe that in respect to its quality does not bear relation either to good or to truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8458</b></p><p><b>8458.</b>
'A tiny round thing' means the good of truth in its initial form. This is clear from the meaning of 'tiny' as a word having reference to truth; and from the meaning of 'round' as a word having reference 
to good. Consequently 'a tiny round thing' has reference to the good of truth. The expression 'good of truth' describes good as it exists with a member of the spiritual Church; such good not only 
begins in truth, but also is in essence truth. One sees it as truth, but one feels it as good; that being so, as truth it forms the understanding part of the mind, and as good it forms the new will part. 
For a person's understanding is distinguishable from the will in that the understanding presents things to itself in mental pictures, in order that it may see them as in light, whereas the will forms 
an affection for them, in order that it may simultaneously feel them as a delight, thus as good, doing so in conformity with the kind of picture that has been formed. </p>
<p>The use of 'tiny' to refer 
to truth and of 'round' to refer to good may be traced back to the visual presentations of truth and good that are made in the next life. When any truth or good is presented visually, which is done in 
the next life in a way clearly perceptible to the eyes of spirits and angels, truth is presented in a definite quantity, thus as something large or something tiny, depending on the nature of the truth. 
Truth is in addition presented as something angular-shaped; it is also presented as something white. But good there is presented in an indefinite quantity, thus not as something large or something 
tiny. Good is also presented as something rounded, as a shape that is uninterrupted, and in respect of colour as something blue, yellow, or red. Good and truth assume these different appearances when 
they are presented visually because each is different as to its essential nature; when the nature of either is made visual, they express and represent themselves in a natural form such as has just been 
described. So it is that things which in the world resemble such forms mean either truth or good; for nothing exists in creation that is unrelated, so far as its essential nature is concerned, either 
to good or to truth. </p>

`Minutum rotundum': quod significet bonum veri in prima formatione, constat ex significatione `minuti' quod (x)praedicetur de vero, et ex significatione `rotundi' quod praedicetur de bono; inde `minutum 
rotundum' {1}praedicatur de bono veri.  Bonum veri dicitur bonum apud hominem Ecclesiae spiritualis, estque non modo quoad originem sed etiam quoad essentiam verum; ut verum apparet, {2} ast ut bonum 
{3} sentitur, proinde ut verum format intellectuale mentis, ac ut bonum format novum voluntarium; distinguitur enim intellectuale a voluntario in homine per id quod intellectuale sistat sibi res 
in forma, et ut videat illas sicut in luce, voluntarium autem afficiatur illis, ut sentiat illas simul sicut jucundum, ita sicut bonum, et hoc secundum quale formae. 	2 Quod `minutum' praedicetur de 
vero, et `rotundum' de bono, causam ex {4}apparitionibus veri et boni in altera vita {5}trahit; cum vera et bona sistuntur visibilia, quod fit in altera vita manifeste ad oculos spirituum et angelorum, 
(d)tunc (t)verum sistitur in quantitate discreta, proinde sicut multum {6}aut sicut minutum, secundum veri quale; sistitur etiam verum ut angulare in varia forma, et quoque sistitur ut album; bonum 
autem (t)ibi sistitur in quantitate continua, sic non ut multum nec ut minutum; sistitur bonum etiam ut rotundum, quod est continuum in forma, et quoad colorem ut caeruleum, flavum, ac rubrum; quod ita 
appareant {7}bonum et verum, cum sistuntur visibilia {8}, est ex {9}differentia illorum quoad quale, {10}quod ita {11}in forma naturali se effert et repraesentat, cum {12}visibile fit; inde {13} est 
quod res quae in mundo accedunt ad tales forma, significent vel vera vel bona, nam nihil {14} in universo datur quod non se refert quoad quale vel ad bonum vel ad verum {15}. 	@1 significat bonum$ 	@2
