<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8047.</strong>出埃及记13:3-10.摩西对百姓说，你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日，因为耶和华用强有力的手将你们从这里领出来，有酵之物都不可吃。亚笔月的这一日你们出来了。将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地，就是祂向你的祖宗起誓应许给你那流奶与蜜之地，那时你要在这月间守这礼。你要吃无酵饼七日，在第七日要向耶和华守节。这七日要吃无酵饼，在你四境之内不可见有发酵之物在你那里，也不可见有酵在你那里。当那日，你要告诉你的儿子说，这是因耶和华在我从埃及出来的时候为我所行的事。这要在你手上给你作记号，在你两眼之间作纪念，使耶和华的律法常在你口中，因为耶和华曾用强有力的手将你从埃及领出来。所以你年年要按着所定的日期守这条例。<br />“摩西对百姓说”表通过神之真理所给予的指示。“你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日”表他们尤其要记得他们被主从属灵的囚禁中释放时所处的状态。“因为耶和华用强有力的手将你们从这里领出来”表他们被主的神性大能释放。“有酵之物都不可吃”表他们不可将被歪曲的任何事物变成他们自己的。“这一日你们出来了”表永远的释放。“亚笔月的”表一个新状态的开始。“将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地”表进入那些陷入邪恶和虚假之人所占据的天堂区域。“就是祂向你的祖宗起誓应许给你”表神性许诺给那些处于良善和真理之人的。“那流奶与蜜之地”表有欢乐喜悦之地。“那时你要在这月间守这礼”表由于主的释放而对祂的永恒敬拜。“你要吃无酵饼七日”表从虚假当中洁净。“在第七日要向耶和华守节”表对主的神圣敬拜。“这七日要吃无酵饼”表他们必须完全从虚假当中洁净。“不可见有发酵之物在你那里”表绝不可接受被歪曲的任何事物。“也不可见有酵在你那里”表也绝不可接受任何虚假。“在你四境之内”表在源于良善的真理范围之内。“当那日，你要告诉你的儿子说”表对真理的内层觉知，这种觉知属于良知。“这是因耶和华在我从埃及出来的时候为我所行的事”表他们被主从属灵的囚禁和诅咒当中释放。“这要在你手上给你作记号”表它必始终在他们的意愿里。“在你两眼之间作纪念”表它必始终在他们的理解力中。“使耶和华的律法常在你口中”表为叫神性真理能在来自那里的一切事物中。“因为耶和华曾用强有力的手将你从埃及领出来”表他们被神性大能释放。“所以你年年要按着所定的日期守这条例”表这秩序律法必须永远保持这种状态。</p>

Verses 3-10. And Moses said unto the people, Remember thou this day, in which ye went out from Egypt, out of the house of servants; because in strength of hand Jehovah led you forth from hence; and what 
is leavened shall not be eaten. This day ye go forth, in the month Abib. And it shall be when Jehovah shall have brought thee unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and 
the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He sware to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt serve this service in this month. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things, 
and in the seventh day is a feast to Jehovah. Unleavened things shall be eaten seven days; and that which is leavened shall not be seen with thee, and leaven shall not be seen with thee in all thy 
border. And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me, in my going forth out of Egypt. And it shall be unto thee for a sign upon thine hand, and for 
a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth; because with a strong hand hath Jehovah led thee forth out of Egypt. And thou shalt keep this statute at the set time from 
year to year. "And Moses said unto the people," signifies instruction by means of truth Divine; "Remember thou this day, in which ye went out from Egypt, out of the house of servants," signifies that 
especially must that state be recollected in which they were when liberated from spiritual captivity by the Lord; "because in strength of hand Jehovah led you forth from hence," signifies that they were 
liberated by the Divine power of the Lord; "and what is leavened shall not be eaten," signifies that there shall not be appropriated anything falsified; "this day ye go forth," signifies liberation 
to eternity; "in the month Abib," signifies the beginning of a new state; "and it shall be when Jehovah shall have brought thee to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the 
Hivite, and the Jebusite," signifies into the region of heaven occupied by those who are in evil and falsity; "which He sware to thy fathers to give thee," signifies which was promised from the Divine 
to those who are in good and truth; "a land flowing with milk and honey," signifies where are gladness and joy; "that thou shalt serve this service in this month," signifies unceasing worship of the 
Lord on account of liberation; "seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things," signifies purification from falsities; "and in the seventh day is a feast to Jehovah," signifies the holy worship of the 
Lord; "unleavened things shall be eaten seven days," signifies that they must be wholly purified from falsities; "and that which is leavened shall not be seen with thee," signifies that what is falsified 
must not be admitted at all; "and leaven shall not be seen with thee," signifies that neither must any falsity be admitted; "in all thy border," signifies so far as the truth which is from good extends 
itself; "and thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying," signifies interior perception of truth, which perception is of conscience; "It is because of that which Jehovah did for me, in my going 
forth out of Egypt," signifies that they were liberated by the Lord from spiritual captivity and from damnation; "and it shall be unto thee for a sign upon thine hand," signifies that it must be constantly 
in the will; "and for a memorial between thine eyes," signifies that it must be constantly in the understanding; "that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth," signifies that the Divine truth may 
be in everything which proceeds thence; "because with a strong hand hath Jehovah led thee forth out of Egypt," signifies that they were liberated by Divine power; "and thou shalt keep this statute 
at the set time from year to year," signifies that this law of order must be in this state continually. </p>

Verses 3-lo And Moses said to the people, Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slaves; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from there. And nothing made with 
yeast shall be eaten. Today you are going out, in the month of Abib. And it shall be when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the 
Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh 
day there shall be a feast to Jehovah. Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and nothing made with yeast shall be seen among you, and no yeast shall be seen among you within all your borders. 
And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, [This is done] because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt. And it shall be for you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your 
eyes, in order that the law of Jehovah may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Jehovah has brought you out of Egypt. And you shall keep this statute at the appointed time from year to year. </p>
