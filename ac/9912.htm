<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9912节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9912.</strong>“完全蓝色”表通过从属天国度的良善而来的流注。这从“蓝色”的含义清楚可知。“蓝色”是指对真理的属天之爱（参看<a href="9466.htm">9466</a>节），也就是相爱的良善；相爱的良善是属天国度的外在良善；因为存在于天堂里的良善按次序从最内层行进到最外层，它们也按行进的次序流入，因为行进就是流入；至于这些良善以哪种次序行进，可参看前文（<a href="9873.htm">9873</a>节）。正是这属天国度的外在良善流入“外袍”所表示的属灵国度的内在良善；该国度的良善，就是对邻之仁的良善来源于那里。这就是为何外袍完全是蓝色的原因。至于良善的流注，情况是这样：系真正良善的良善是不可能存在的，除非它拥有它从中发出的一种内层良善在自己里面；它从中所发出的内层良善构成它的本质。正因如此，这内层良善存在于在它之后的良善中，几乎如何灵魂存在于它的身体中。“之后的良善”是指从另一种良善，就是更内在的良善发出的良善。对邻之仁的良善从相爱的良善发出，相爱的良善是一种在先或更内在的良善，这在前面数次说明了。相爱的良善是纯真的外在良善，仁之良善若没有纯真良善在里面，就不是仁之良善（<a href="2526.htm">2526</a>，<a href="2780.htm">2780</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>，<a href="6765.htm">6765</a>，<a href="7840.htm">7840</a>，<a href="9262.htm">9262</a>节）；因此，仁之良善若没有相爱的良善在里面，就不是仁之良善。这一切解释了为何外袍要完全是蓝色的；因为“蓝色”表示相爱的良善，或也可说，纯真的外在良善；“外袍”表示属灵国度中内在形式上的神性真理，内在形式上的神性真理与仁之良善是一样的（<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节）。</p>

All of blue. That this signifies by means of influx from the good of the celestial kingdom, is evident from the signification of "blue" [hyacinthinum], as being the celestial love of truth (see n. 9466), 
which is the good of mutual love; and the good of mutual love is the external good of the celestial kingdom; for the goods in the heavens proceed in order from the inmosts to the extremes, and they 
inflow in the same order as they proceed; for to proceed is to flow in. (In what order goods proceed, see n. 9873.) It is this external good of the celestial kingdom that flows into the internal good 
of the spiritual kingdom, which is signified by "the robe." From this comes-forth the good of the spiritual kingdom, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor. This is the reason why the robe 
was all of blue. With regard to the influx of goods, the case is this. There is no good which is good unless it has within it an interior good from which it is; the interior good from which it is makes 
its essence; whence it is that this interior good exists in the good which follows, almost as the soul exists in its body. It is this following good of which it is said that it proceeds from another 
good, which is more interior. That the good of charity toward the neighbor proceeds from the good of mutual love, which is a prior or interior good, has been shown several times. The good of mutual 
love is the external good of innocence, and unless the good of charity has within it the good of innocence, it is not the good of charity (n. 2526, 2780, 3183, 4797, 6765, 7840, 9262), consequently not 
unless it has within it the good of mutual love. This is the reason why the robe was to be all of blue; for "blue" denotes the good of mutual love, or what is the same thing, the external good of innocence; 
and "the robe" denotes Divine truth in the internal form in the spiritual kingdom, which is the same thing as the good of charity (n. 9825). </p>

'The whole from violet' means through an inflow from the good of the celestial kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'violet' as the celestial love of truth, dealt with in <a href="9466.htm">9466</a>, which is the good 
of mutual love, the good of mutual love being the external good of the celestial kingdom. (The kinds of good that exist in the heavens proceed in order from inmost ones to outermost; and in the order 
in which they proceed they also flow in, for to proceed is to flow in. In what order those kinds of good proceed, see <a href="9873.htm">9873</a>.) That good is the one which flows into the internal good of the spiritual 
kingdom, which is meant by 'the robe'; from there springs the good of this kingdom, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour. This then is why the robe, the whole of it, consisted of violet. 
The nature of the inflow of the kinds of good into one another is such that none which is indeed good can exist unless it has within itself a more internal kind of good from which it proceeds; the more 
internal from which it proceeds constitutes its essence. So it is that this internal good comes to be present in that which follows it, almost as the soul is present in its body. The description 'that 
which follows' refers to that which proceeds from the other more internal good. The fact that the good of charity towards the neighbour proceeds from the good of mutual love, which is the prior or 
more internal good, has been shown several times. The good of mutual love is the external good of innocence, and unless the good of charity has within itself the good of innocence it is not the good 
of charity, <a href="2526.htm">2526</a>, <a href="2780.htm">2780</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>, <a href="6765.htm">6765</a>, <a href="7840.htm">7840</a>, <a href="9262.htm">9262</a>, consequently is not such unless it has within itself the good of mutual love. All this now explains why the robe consisted, the whole of it, of violet; 
for 'violet' means the good of mutual love, or what amounts to the same thing, the external good of innocence, and 'the robe' means Divine Truth in its inward form in the spiritual kingdom, which 
is the same thing as the good of charity, <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>.  </p>

`Totum hyacinthino' : quod significet per influxum ex bono regni caelestis, constat ex significatione `hyacinthini' quod sit caelestis amor veri, de qua n. 9466, {1}quod est bonum amoris mutui, et bonum 
amoris mutui est bonum externum regni caelestis; nam bona in caelis procedunt ordine ab intimis ad extrema, et quo ordine procedunt, etiam influunt, nam procedere est influere; quo ordine bona procedunt, 
videatur n. 9873; hoc bonum est quod influit in bonum internum regni spiritualis, quod per `pallium' significatur; inde existit ejus bonum, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum; inde nunc 
est quod pallium esset totum ex hyacinthino; cum {2}influxu bonorum ita se habet: non datur aliquod bonum quod bonum {3} nisi in se habeat bonum interius ex quo; bonum interius ex quo facit essentiam 
ejus; unde est quod id bonum existat in sequente paene sicut anima in suo corpore; id sequens est, de quo dicitur quod procedat ex altero, quod est interius; quod bonum charitatis erga proximum procedat 
ex bono amoris mutui, quod est bonum {4}prius seu interius, aliquoties (t)ostensum est; bonum amoris mutui est bonum innocentiae externum, et nisi bonum charitatis in se habeat bonum innocentiae, non 
est bonum charitatis, n. 2526, 2780, 3183, 4797, 6765, 7840, 9262, consequenter nisi in se habeat bonum amoris mutui; inde nunc est quod pallium ex hyacinthino totum fuerit, nam hyacinthinum est bonum 
amoris mutui, seu quod idem, bonum innocentiae externum, et pallium est Divinum Verum in forma interna in regno spirituali, quod idem est cum bono charitatis, n. 9825. @1 quod est bonum charitatis
