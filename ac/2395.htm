<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2395节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2395.</strong>“我们要毁灭这地方”表他们所在的邪恶状态会定他们的罪。这从论及主时“毁灭”的含义，以及“这地方”的含义清楚可知：“毁灭”的内在含义是指因邪恶而灭亡，也就是被定罪；“这地方”是指邪恶的状态（<a href="2393.htm">2393</a>节）。圣言经常提及耶和华“毁灭”；但就内义而言，它是指人自我毁灭，因为耶和华或主不毁灭任何人。不过，由于从主看见并管理万物，无论总体还是细节的事实来看，毁灭似乎出自耶和华或主，故为了使人们由此被保守在最一般的概念中，即万物都在主的眼前，万物都在祂的指导之下，这样的表述多次出现在圣言中。他们一旦被保守在这种概念中，以后就能很容易地接受教导。对圣言内义的解读无非是阐明一般概念的细节。<br />那些没有爱的人被保守在恐惧中还有另外一个原因，他们在这恐惧中会敬畏主，并逃到祂那里寻求拯救。由此明显可知，相信字义并没有什么伤害，即便内义教导的是别的事，只要这种信仰是出于简单的心思。这些要点将在下文（19:24，2447节）予以充分说明，那里说到“耶和华将硫磺与火降与所多玛和蛾摩拉”。因为通晓内义的天使根本不会思想耶和华或主会毁灭任何人，以致他们无法忍受这种观念。所以，当世人在圣言中读到这些及其它类似事时，字义可以说被抛到后面，最终变成这样的教导：毁灭人的是邪恶本身，主不毁灭任何人，这从前面提到的例子（<a href="1875.htm">1875</a>节）可以看出来。</p>

For we will destroy this place. That this signifies that the state of evil in which they were would condemn them, is evident from the meaning of "destroying," when predicated of the Lord, as being in 
the internal significance to perish by evil, that is, to be condemned; and also from the signification of "this place," as being a state of evil (n. 2393). It is frequently said in the Word that Jehovah 
"destroys;" but in the internal sense it is meant that man destroys himself; for Jehovah or the Lord destroys no one. But as from the fact of His seeing and regulating all things in both general and 
particular it appears as if the destruction came from Jehovah or the Lord, it is so expressed in many places in the Word, to the end that men may thereby be kept in a most general idea that all things 
are under the Lord's eyes, and all things under His auspices; for if at first they are kept in this idea, they can afterwards be easily instructed. For the explications of the Word as to the internal 
sense are nothing but particulars that elucidate a general idea. [2] Another reason why it is so expressed is that they who are in no love are kept in fear, and thereby stand in awe of the Lord, 
and flee to Him for the sake of deliverance. This shows that it does no harm to believe the sense of the letter, even though the internal sense teaches something else, provided that it is done from a 
simple heart. But these things will be treated of more fully in what follows, at verse 24 (n. 2447), where it is said that Jehovah caused it to rain brimstone and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah. The angels, 
being in the internal sense, are so far from thinking that Jehovah destroys anyone that they cannot endure even the idea of such a thing; and therefore when these and other such things are read in 
the Word by man, the sense of the letter is cast away as it were to the back, and at last passes into this: that evil itself is what destroys man, and that the Lord destroys no one (as may be seen from 
the example given above in n. 1875). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2395</b></p><p><b>2395.</b>
'For we are destroying this place' means that the state of evil which was theirs would condemn them. This is clear from the meaning of 'destroy', when used of the Lord, as - in the internal meaning - 
to perish from evil, that is, to be condemned; and also from the meaning of 'place' as a state of evil, <a href="2393.htm">2393</a>. The expression 'Jehovah destroys' occurs many times in the Word, but in the internal sense 
the meaning is that man destroys himself, for Jehovah or the Lord destroys no one. But because it does seem as though Jehovah or the Lord were the author of such destruction since He sees every single 
thing and governs every single thing, that expression occurs in various places in the Word, for the reason that it holds men to the very general idea that all things are before the Lord's eyes and 
all things under His guidance. Once they are held to that idea men can then be taught easily, for explanations of the Word giving its internal sense are nothing other than the details that fill out the 
general idea. There is the further reason that those who do not have love are held in fear, and in that fear revere the Lord and flee to Him for deliverance. From this it is evident that it does no 
harm to believe the sense of the letter, even though the internal sense teaches something other, provided that such belief is that of a simple heart. But these points are dealt with more fully further 
on at verse 24, in <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, where it is said that 'Jehovah rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire'. Because they have the internal sense angels are so far removed from thinking of Jehovah's or 
the Lord's destroying anybody that they do not tolerate the very idea. Consequently when man reads these and similar statements in the Word, the sense of the letter is so to speak pushed to the back and 
at length merges into the teaching that evil itself is what destroys a person and that the Lord destroys nobody, as becomes clear from the example referred to in <a href="1875.htm">1875</a>. </p>

</p><b>2395.</b>
`Quia perdentes nos locum hunc': quod significet quod status mali in quo erant, damnaret eos, constat a sensu `perdere' cum praedicatur de Domino, quod in significatu interno sit perire a malo hoc est, 
damnari; tum a significatione `loci' quod sit status mali, n. 2393.  Multoties in Verbo occurrit quod `Jehovah perdat,' sed in sensu interno intelligitur quod homo semet perdat, Jehovah enim seu Dominus 
nullum perdit, sed quia apparet sicut foret a Jehovah seu Domino, quia omnia et singula videt, et omnia et singula regit, ita passim locutum est in Verbo ob causam ut inde homines teneantur in 
communissima idea, quod omnia sub oculis Domini sint, et omnia sub Ipsius auspicio, in qua idea cum primum tenentur, dein possunt facile instrui; explicationes enim Verbi quoad sensum internum, non sunt 
nisi quam singularia quae communem ideam elucidant: causa etiam est quod qui in nullo amore sunt, teneantur in timore, et sic vereantur Dominum et ad Ipsum propter liberationem fugiant; inde patet 
quod nihil noceat quod credatur sensui litterae, tametsi internus aliud docet, modo illud fiat ex simplici corde; sed de his plenius in sequentibus ad vers. 24, n. 2447, ubi dicitur quod `Jehovah pluere 
fecit super Sodomam et Amoram sulphur et ignem'; tantum abest ut angeli quia in sensu interno sunt, cogitent quod Jehovah seu Dominus aliquem perdat, ut solam ejus rei ideam non sustineant, quare cum 
haec et similia in Verbo ab homine leguntur, rejicitur quasi ad tergum sensus litterae, et abit tandem in illum, quod ipsum malum sit quod perdit hominem, {1} et quod Dominus neminem perdat, ut constare 
potest ab exemplo, de quo n. 1875. 	@1 A i et sic damnat illum. This should probably have been deleted for it continues et quod Dominus neminem perdat, minus damnet, quia nihil nisi bonum ab Ipso. 
From minus to Ipso is then deleted.$ </p>
