<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3986节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3986.</strong>“耶和华赐福与你，是因我脚立在这里”表这是由属世层所拥有的神性恩赐带来的。这从“耶和华赐福”的含义清楚可知，“耶和华赐福”是指被赋予良善（<a href="3406.htm">3406</a>节）；这就是结合（<a href="3504.htm">3504</a>，<a href="3514.htm">3514</a>，<a href="3530.htm">3530</a>，<a href="3565.htm">3565</a>，<a href="3584.htm">3584</a>节）；因此“耶和华赐福”表示通过结合被赋予神性良善，在此表示被赋予“雅各”所代表的属世层的良善，因为“脚”就表示属世层。“脚”表示属世层（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>节），这一点从大人与人的各个部位的对应关系明显看出来，如各章末尾所说明的。由此明显可知，“耶和华赐福与你，是因我脚立在这里”表示源于属世层所拥有的神性。<br />知道隐藏在这些话和它们之前的那些话里面的奥秘之人即便有，也是极少，因此有必要揭开它。存在于人（无论教会内的人还是教会外的人）里面的良善绝对是各种各样的，并且如此不同以至于没有哪两个人的良善是一模一样的。这种多样性起因于与这些良善结合的真理；因为一切良善皆从真理得其性质，而真理则从良善得其本质。这种多样性还起因于每个人的爱之情感；这些情感就根植在人里面，并通过他所过的生活而变成他自己的。甚至存在于教会内的人里面的纯正真理很少，存在于教会外的人里面的就更少了。因此，对纯正真理的情感在世人中间是十分罕见的。<br />尽管如此，那些过着良善生活，也就是活在对主之爱和对邻之仁中的人仍能得救。他们能得救的原因在于，主的神性就存在于源自对神之爱的良善和源自对邻之仁的良善里面。当神性在里面时，一切事物就都被有序排列，以便它们能与存在于诸天堂中的纯正良善并纯正真理联结。这一事实从构成天堂的社群可以看出来，这些社群不计其数。就良善与真理而言，所有社群，无论总体还是细节，都各不相同，然而却都合在一起形成一个完整的天堂。它们就像人体的各个部位和器皿，尽管处处都不一样，却仍构成一个完整的人。因为没有一个完整的整体是由任何相同或完全相似的个别部分组成的，而是由和谐地结合在一起的不同部分组成的。不同部分和谐地结合在一起，构成一个整体。这同样适用于灵界中的良善与真理，尽管它们差别如此之大，以至于没有哪两个人所具有的良善与真理是完全一样的；然而，它们却通过神性经由爱和仁成为一体，因为爱和仁就是属灵的结合。它们的多样性就是天上的一种和谐，这种和谐产生这样的一致，以致它们在神性，也就是主里面为一。<br />此外，无论真理和对真理的情感如何各异，源自对神之爱的良善和源自对邻之仁的良善仍能接受纯正的真理和良善；因为可以说它们并不坚硬和抵抗，而是柔软和顺从。他们允许自己被主引领，并由此被转向良善，并通过良善被转向主。而那些陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱的人就截然不同了。他们不让自己被主引领，并转向主，而是强烈抵抗，因为他们渴望自我引领，尤其当他们陷入被确认的虚假原则之时。只要他们具有这种秉性，就不允许神性进入。<br />由此明显可知雅各对拉班所说的这些话在内义上表示什么；“拉班”表示并不纯正的那类良善，因为纯正的真理没有植入在它里面；不过，它具有这样的性质，这些纯正真理能与它结合，并且神性能存在于它里面。这种良善通常存在于尚未接受纯正真理的小孩子，以及教会内知道很少的信之真理，却活在仁爱中的简单人里面；这种良善还存在于正直的外邦人当中，他们会向自己的神明献上神圣的敬拜。纯正的真理与良善能通过这种良善被引入，这一点从前面有关小孩子和教会内的简单人（<a href="3690.htm">3690</a>节），以及教会外正直的外邦人（<a href="2598.htm">2598</a>-<a href="2603.htm">2603</a>节）的阐述可以看出来。</p>

And Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot. That this signifies that it was from the Divine which the natural had, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah blessing," as being to endow with good (see 
n. 3406); and that this is conjunction (n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584); thus "Jehovah blessing" signifies to be endowed with Divine good through conjunction; here, with the good of the natural, 
which is represented by Jacob. It is the natural that is signified by the "foot." That the "foot" is the natural may be seen above (n. 2162, 3147, 3761), and the same will appear from the correspondence 
of the Grand Man with everything in man, as shown at the end of the chapters. From this it is evident that by "Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot," is signified from the Divine which the natural 
had. [2] The arcanum which lies concealed within these words and in those which immediately precede, is known to few, if any, and is therefore to be revealed. The goods that are in men, as well within 
the church as without it, are absolutely various, so various that the good of one man is never precisely like that of another. The varieties come forth from the truths with which the goods are conjoined; 
for all good has its quality from truths, and truths have their essential from goods. Varieties come forth also from the affections of everyone's love; which are enrooted in and appropriated to 
a man by his life. Even in the man who is within the church there are few genuine truths, and still fewer in the man who is without the church; so that the affections of genuine truth are rare among men. 
 [3] Nevertheless they who are in the good of life, that is, who live in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, are saved. That these can be saved is because the Divine of the Lord 
is in the good of love to God and in the good of charity toward the neighbor; and where the Divine is within, there all things are disposed into order, so that they can be conjoined with the genuine goods 
and genuine truths that are in the heavens. That this is the case may be seen from the societies that constitute heaven, which are innumerable, and all of which in both general and particular are 
various in respect to good and truth, and yet all taken together form One Heaven; being circumstanced as are the members and organs of the human body, which, although everywhere various, nevertheless 
constitute one man. For a one that is formed of many is never constituted of units of exactly the same pattern; but of varying things harmoniously conjoined. Everyone is composed of various things harmoniously 
conjoined; and the case is the same with the goods and truths in the spiritual world, which, although various, so that they are never precisely the same with one as with another, nevertheless 
make a one from the Divine through love and charity. For love and charity are spiritual conjunction; and their variety is heavenly harmony, which makes such concord that they are a one in the Divine, 
that is, in the Lord. [4] Moreover the good of love to God and the good of charity toward the neighbor, however various may be the truths and the affections of truth, are nevertheless receptive of 
genuine truth and good; for they are so to speak not hard and resisting, but are as it were soft and yielding, suffering themselves to be led by the Lord, and thus to be bent to good, and through good 
to Him. Very different is the case with those who are in the love of self and of the world. These do not suffer themselves to be led and bent by the Lord and to the Lord, but resist stiffly, for they 
desire to lead themselves; and this is still more the case when they are in principles of falsity that have been confirmed. So long as they are of this character they do not admit the Divine.  [5] 
From all this it is now evident what is signified in the internal sense by the words which Jacob spoke to Laban; for by "Laban" is signified such good as is not genuine, because genuine truths have not 
been implanted in it; but yet it is of such a nature that these can be conjoined with it, and that the Divine can be in it. Such good is wont to exist in young children before they have received genuine 
truths; and also in the simple within the church, who know few truths of faith, and yet live in charity; and such good also exists among the upright Gentiles, who are in holy worship of their gods. 
By means of such good, genuine truths and goods can be introduced, as may be seen from what has been said about little children and the simple within the church (n. 3690); and about the upright Gentiles 
outside of the church (n. 2598-2603). </p>

'And Jehovah has blessed you since I set foot here' means resulting from the Divine endowment which the natural possessed. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah blessing' as being endowed with good, 
dealt with in <a href="3406.htm">3406</a>, and as a joining together, <a href="3504.htm">3504</a>, <a href="3514.htm">3514</a>, <a href="3530.htm">3530</a>, <a href="3565.htm">3565</a>, <a href="3584.htm">3584</a>. 'Jehovah blessing' accordingly means being endowed with Divine good by means of a joining together, at this point a joining 
to the good of the natural represented by 'Jacob', the natural being meant by 'the foot'. As regards 'the foot' meaning the natural, see <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>; and this will be clear in addition from 
the correspondence of the Grand Man with every part of the human being, the subject in the sections at the ends of chapters. From this it is evident that 'Jehovah has blessed you since I set foot here' 
means originating in the Divine which the natural possessed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The arcanum which lies concealed in these words and in those immediately before them is known to few, if any, and is therefore to 
be revealed. The goods present with people both inside the Church and outside it vary in every case. They vary so much that no one person's good is ever exactly like another's. These variations arise 
out of the truths to which those goods are joined, for the nature of every type of good is received from truths, and truths derive their essential nature from goods. Such variations also arise out of 
the affections that belong to each person's love, and which become rooted in a person and are made his own through the life he leads. Few genuine truths exist even with someone inside the Church, and 
fewer still with one outside. Consequently affections for genuine truth seldom exist with anyone. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 All the same, people who lead good lives, that is, who live in love to God and in charity towards 
the neighbour, are saved. The reason they are able to be saved is that the Lord's Divine is present within good that stems from love to God and within good that stems from charity towards the neighbour. 
And when the Divine is inwardly present everything is being arranged into order so that it can be joined to genuine goods and genuine truths which exist in the heavens. The truth of this may be 
proven from the communities constituting heaven, which are countless. Every single community varies as regards good and truth, and yet all of them taken together form one complete heaven. They are like 
the members and organs of the human body which, though varying in every case, still constitute one complete human being. For no complete whole is ever made up of any identical or entirely similar individual 
parts, but of varying parts harmoniously joined together. Varying parts joined together harmoniously present a single whole. The same applies to goods and truths in the spiritual world. Although 
these vary so much as never to be exactly similar with one person as with another, nevertheless from the Divine through love and charity they make one since love and charity are spiritual conjunction. 
Their variation is a heavenly harmony which produces such accord that they are one in the Divine, that is, in the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Furthermore, however much truths may vary, and however much affections 
for truth may do so, good that stems from love to God and good that stems from charity towards the neighbour are nevertheless capable of receiving genuine truth and good, as they are not so to speak 
hard and resistant but soft and yielding. They allow themselves to be led by the Lord and in so doing to be turned towards good, and through good to be turned towards Him. It is different with those 
in whom self-love and love of the world reign. They do not allow themselves to be led and turned by the Lord towards the Lord but strongly resist, since each wishes to be his own leader, even more so 
when they have become subject to false and firmly established assumptions. As long as they are such they do not allow the Divine to come in. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These considerations now make clear what is meant 
in the internal sense by these words which Jacob addressed to Laban, for 'Laban' means the kind of good which is not genuine because it does not have genuine truths planted within it but is nevertheless 
capable of having these joined to it and of having the Divine present within it. This kind of good is what normally exists with young children before they have received genuine truths. It is also the 
kind of good present with simple people within the Church who know few truths of faith but who nevertheless lead a charitable life. It is in addition the kind of good present with upright gentiles 
who offer holy worship to their gods. By means of such good, genuine truths and goods are able to be introduced, as may be seen from what has been stated about young children and simple people inside 
the Church in <a href="3690.htm">3690</a>, and about upright gentiles outside the Church in <a href="2598.htm">2598</a>-<a href="2603.htm">2603</a>. </p>

`Et benedixit {1}tibi Jehovah' ad pedem meum': quod significet a Divino quod naturali, constat a significatione `benedicere Jehovah' quod sit donari bono, de qua n. 3406, et quod sit conjunctio, 
n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584, ita `benedicere Jehovah' est donari bono Divino per conjunctionem, hic cum bono naturalis quod per `Jacobum' repraesentatur; naturale est quod per `pedem' significatur; 
quod `pes' sit naturale, videatur n. 2162, 3147, 3761, et porro constabit (c)a correspondentia Maximi Hominis cum singulis apud hominem ad finem capitum; inde patet quod per `benedixit tibi Jehovah 
ad pedem meum' significetur a Divino quod naturali.  [2] Arcanum quod in bis et in illis quae mox praecedunt, latet reconditum, paucis si ulli notum est, quapropter revelandum; </p>
<p>bona quae apud 
homines tam intra Ecclesiam quam extra Ecclesiam, sunt prorsus varia, et tam varia ut bonum unius hominis non sit prorsus simile bono alterius; varietates existunt a veris cum quibus bona conjunguntur, 
omne enim bonum habet suum quale a veris, et vera habent suum essentiale a bonis, varietates etiam existunt ab affectionibus quae sunt amoris cujusvis, quae radicantur et appropriantur homini 
per vitam ejus; sunt apud hominem, etiam intra Ecclesiam, pauca vera genuina, et adhuc pauciora apud hominem extra Ecclesiam, inde raro sunt affectiones veri genuini; [3] sed usque illi qui in bono 
vitae sunt, seu qui in amore in Deum et in charitate erga proximum vivunt, salvantur; quod salvari possint, est inde quia Divinum Domini inest bono amoris in Deum et bono charitatis erga proximum, 
et ubi Divinum inest, ibi disponuntur omnia in ordinem, ut conjungi possint cum genuinis bonis et genuinis veris quae in caelis; quod ita sit, constare potest (c)a societatibus quae {2}caelum constituunt, 
quae innumerabiles sunt, et quarum omnes et singulae quoad bonum et verum variae sunt, at usque simul sumptae unum caelum {3}conformant; se habent illae sicut membra et organa corporis humani, 
quae tametsi ubivis varia, usque tamen unum hominem {4}constituunt; unum enim nusquam constituitur cum pluribus ab unis iisdem, seu prorsus similibus, sed a variis harmonice conjunctis; varia 
harmonice conjuncta sistunt omne unum; similiter se habet cum bonis et veris in mundo spirituali, quae tametsi varia sunt adeo ut non prorsus similia {5}apud unum sicut apud alterum, usque unum faciunt 
a Divino {6}per amorem et charitatem amor enim et charitas est conjunctio spiritualis; varietas eorum es caelestis harmonia, quae facit tale concors ut unum sint in Divino, hoc est, in Domino; 
[4] praeterea bonum amoris in Deum et bonum charitatis erga proximum, utcumque {7}vera varia sunt, et veri affectiones variae, usque sunt receptibilia veri et boni genuini, sunt enim, ut ita dicatur, 
non dura et resistibilia, sed quasi mollia et cedentia, patiuntur enim se duci a Domino, et sic flecti ad bonum, et per bonum a Ipsum; </p>
<p>aliter qui in amore sui et mundi sunt, illi non patiuntur 
enim se duci et flecti a Domino, et ad Dominum, sed duriter resistunt, nam semet ducere volunt, et magis adhuc cum iidem in principiis falsi confirmatis sunt; [5] quamdiu tales sunt, non admittunt 
Divinum.  Ex hi nunc constare potest quid in sensu interno significatur per illa verba quae Jacobus ad Labanem locutus est; per `Labanem' enim significatur tale bonum quod non genuinum est, quia non 
ei genuina vera implantata sunt, sed usque tale ut ei conjungi possint et in quo Divinum possit esse; quale bonum solet esse apud infantes pueros antequam receperint genuina vera; et quale bonum 
etiam apud simplices intra Ecclesiam qui pauca vera fidei sciunt, sed usque in charitate vivunt; et quale etiam apud gentes probas quae in sancto cultu suorum deorum sunt; per tale bonum introduci 
possunt vera et bona genuina, ut constare potest ab illis quae de infantibus et simplicibus intra Ecclesiam n. 3690 dicta sunt; et quae de gentibus probis extra Ecclesiam n. 2598-2603. @1 cap. xxx
