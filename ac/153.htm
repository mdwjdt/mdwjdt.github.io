<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第153节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>153.</strong>圣经说肋骨被“建成一个女人”，而非像前面论述重生时说“创造成”、“作成”、“造成”一个女人，这是因为，“建”系指立起曾经倒下的。圣经即在此意义上用词，其中“建造”针对罪恶，“立起”针对错误，“恢复”则针对两者。例如：“他们必建造已久的荒场，重新立起先前凄凉之处，恢复历代荒凉之城。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.4.htm">61:4</a>）<br />在此处并其它各处经文中，“荒场”象征罪恶，“凄凉之地”象征错误，“建造”被用于前者，“重新立起”被用于后者。先知书其它各处也恪守这种分别，例如：“以色列的处女哪，我要再建造你，你就得建造。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.4.htm">31:4</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]153.</strong> The exact wording is that the woman was built out of a rib, not that she was made, formed, or created, as before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_153/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88" target=_top>88</a>], where regeneration was discussed. Build is used because it means reconstructing what has fallen. It is similar to places where the Word uses build of evil, raise up of falsities, and renew of both. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />They will rebuild the eternal wastelands, the ancient desolate places they will raise up, and they will renew the wasted cities, the desolate places of generation after generation. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_153/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_61_4" target=_top>Isaiah 61:4</a>)<br />Wastelands here and elsewhere stand for evil, while desolate places stand for falsities; build is applied to the former and raise up to the latter — a distinction carefully observed in other prophetic passages. In Jeremiah:<br />I will build you again so that you may be built up, virgin of Israel.{*1} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_153/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_4" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:4</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the word virgin, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_153/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54" target=_top>54</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 153</b></p><p><b>153.</b>
The rib is said to be "built into a woman" but it is not said that the woman was "created" or "formed" or "made" as before when treating of regeneration. The reason of this is that to "build" is to raise 
up that which has fallen; and in this sense it is used in the Word, where to "build" is predicated of evils; to "raise up" of falsities; and to "renew" of both; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They shall build 
the wastes of eternity, they shall set up again the ancient desolations, and they shall renew the cities of the waste, the desolations of generation and generation (Isa. 61:4). "Wastes" in this and 
other passages signify evils; "desolations" falsities; to "build" is applied to the former, to "set up again" to the latter, and this distinction is carefully observed in other places by the prophets, 
as where it is said in Jeremiah:     Yet still will I build thee, and thou shall be built, O virgin of Israel (Jer. 31:4). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 153</b></p><p><b>153.</b>
It is said that the rib was built into a woman, and not as previously, when regeneration was the subject, that the woman was created, or formed, or made. The word 'built' is used because building means 
reconstructing that which has fallen down. This is how it is used in the Word, where 'building' has reference to evils, 'raising up' to falsities, and 'renewing' to both, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will 
build up the waste places of old, they will raise up the former desolations, and they will renew the waste cities, the desolations of generation upon generation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Waste places' here and 
elsewhere stands for evils, 'desolations' for falsities. The expression 'to build' is applied to the former, 'to raise up' to the latter, and this distinction is also carefully observed in other places 
in the Prophets: in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Again I will build you, that you may be built, O virgin of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:4</a>.   
</blockquote>

</p><b>153.</b>
Aedificata dicitur costa in mulierem, non autem mulier creata, aut formata, aut facta, ut prius ubi de regeneratione agitur: quod aedificata dicatur, causa est quia aedificare significat exstruere id 
quod lapsum est; in Verbo similiter, ubi 'aedificare' praedicatur de malis, 'erigere' de falsis, 'renovare' de utrisque; ut apud Esaiam, Aedificabunt vastitates aeternitatis, desolationes priscas erigent, 
et renovabunt urbes vastitatis, desolationes generationis et generationis, lxi 4; </p>
<p>'vastitates' hic et alibi pro malis, 'desolationes' pro falsis; illis applicatur vox 'aedificare,' his 'erigere,' 
sicut alibi quoque apud Prophetas, quod accurate observatur; apud Jeremiam, Adhuc aedificabo te, ut aedificata sis, virgo Israel, xxxi 4. </p>
