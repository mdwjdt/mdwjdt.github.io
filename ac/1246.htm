<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1246节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1246.</strong>所有这些都是由希伯的宗族组成的众多民族。这从他们的那个时代背景清楚可知。如前所述，在上古时代，各民族被划分为独立的宗族，宗教又被分为家庭。一个民族认一个先祖，并以他命名。当一个先祖的子孙增多时，他们又以同样的方式组成家庭、宗族和民族，依此类推；所以，约坍的这些子孙同样如此。这一点从雅各的子孙清楚看出来，后来他们增多后，就组成了各个支派，每个支派认可雅各子孙中的一个，以他命名，作为其先祖；然而，他们全都来自雅各，并被称作雅各。同样，这些民族是希伯的后代，被称为希伯来人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1246.</strong> The fact that these were individual nations formed from the clans of Eber can be seen from conditions at that period. In earliest times, as previously noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1246/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1238#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1238:2</a>], people lived as nations divided into clans and as clans divided into households, and each nation acknowledged one father, for whom it was named. When the children of one father multiplied, they likewise formed households, clans, and nations; and so on.<br />These people, the offspring of Joktan, lived a similar way, as can be seen from the children of Jacob. When they eventually multiplied, they formed tribes, each of which claimed one of Jacob's sons as the father for whom it was named. Yet all of them taken together came from Jacob and were called Jacob. By the same token, all these nations came from Eber and were called Hebrews. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1246</b></p><p><b>1246.</b>
That these were so many nations, of the families of Eber, may be seen from the state in which they lived at that period. In the most ancient time, as has been said before, nations were distinguished 
into families, and these into households. Each nation acknowledged one father, from whom it was named. As they were multiplied, the sons of the one father in like manner constituted households, families, 
and nations; and so on. So it was with these sons of Joktan, as we may see it was with the sons of Jacob, who afterwards when multiplied constituted tribes, each one of which acknowledged one of the 
sons of Jacob, from whom it was named, as its father; and yet all taken together were from Jacob, and were called Jacob. Just so these nations were from Eber, and were called Hebrews. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1246</b></p><p><b>1246.</b>
That these were just so many nations consisting of the families of Eber becomes clear from their condition at that time. As stated already, in most ancient times nations lived distinguished into separate 
families, and families into houses. Each nation recognized one father from whom it took its name. When the sons of one father multiplied they in a similar way constituted houses, families, and nations, 
and so on; as did those who were the sons of Joktan. This becomes clear from the sons of Jacob who at a later time when they multiplied constituted tribes, each one of which recognized as its father, 
and took its name from, one of the sons of Jacob. But taken all together they were descended from Jacob, and were called Jacob. In the same way these nations were descended from Eber and were called 
the Hebrews. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1246</b>
</p><b>1246.</b>
Quod hae fuerint totidem gentes ex familiis Eberi, constare potest ex statu in quo fuerunt illo tempore; antiquissimo tempore vixerunt, ut prius dictum, gentes distinctae in familias, et hae in domos; 
unaquaevis gens agnoscebat unum patrem a quo nominabatur; filii unius patris, cum multiplicabantur, similiter constituebant domos, familias et gentes, et sic porro:  hi qui filii Joktanis fuerunt, 
similiter; sicut constare potest a filiis Jacobi qui postea, cum multiplicati, constituebant tribus, quarum unaquaevis agnoscebat pro patre, a quo nominabatur, unum ex filiis Jacobi; sed usque omnes simul 
sumpti ex Jacobo, et vocati Jacob; ita hae gentes ex Ebero, et vocati sunt Hebraei. </p>
