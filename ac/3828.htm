Verses 21-24. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my woman, for my days are fulfilled, and I will come to her. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. And it came to pass 
in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her. And Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. "And Jacob said unto Laban, 
Give me my woman," signifies that from general good there was now conjunction with the affection of interior truth; "for my days are fulfilled, and I will come to her," signifies that now was the state 
in question; "and Laban gathered together all the men of the place," signifies all the truths of that state; "and made a feast," signifies initiation; "and it came to pass in the evening," signifies 
the state as yet obscure; "that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her," signifies that as yet there was conjunction only with the affection of external truth; "and Laban 
gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid," signifies the external affections or external bonds which are subservient means. </p>

Verses 21-24 And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are completed, and I will go [in] to her. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast. And so it was in the 
evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him; and he came [in] to her. And Laban gave to her Zilpah his servant-girl - to Leah his daughter to be her servant-girl. </p>
<p>'Jacob said to 
Laban, Give me my wife' means that general good was now to be joined to the affection for interior truth. 'For my days are completed, so that I may go [in] to her' means that that state had now been 
reached. 'And Laban gathered together all the men of the place' means all the truths belonging to that state. 'And made a feast' means the introduction. 'And so it was in the evening' means when the state 
was still obscure. 'That he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him; and he came [in] to her' means that as yet it was a joining merely to the affection for external truth. 'And Laban gave 
to her Zilpah his servant-girl - to Leah his daughter to be her servant-girl' means external affections or external bonds which are subservient means. </p>

Vers. 21-24.  Et dixit Jacob ad Labanem, Da mulierem meam, quia impleti dies mei, et veniam ad illam.  Et collegit Laban omnes viros loci, et fecit convivium.  Et fuit in vespera, et accepit Leam 
filiam suam, et adduxit illam ad eum, et venit ad illam.  Et dedit Laban illi Zilpam ancillam suam Leae filiae suae ancillam. `Dixit Jacob ad Labanem, Da mulierem meam' significat quod a bono communi 
nunc conjunctio cum affectione veri interioris:  `quia impleti dies mei, ut veniam ad illam' significat quod nunc status: </p>
<p>et collegit Laban omnes viros loci' significat omnia vera illius status: 
 `et fecit convivium' significat initiationem:  `et fuit in vespera' significat statum adhuc obscurum:  `et accepit Leam filiam suam, et adduxit illam ad eum, et venit ad illam' significat quod solum 
conjunctio adhuc esset cum affectione veri externi:  `et dedit Laban illi Zilpam ancillam suam Leae filiae suae ancillam' significat externas affectiones seu externa vincula quae media inservientia. </p>
