<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8702节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8702.</strong>“现在你要听我的声音”表由于合一的一致。这从“听声音”的含义清楚可知，“听声音”是指服从，但在此是指一致，因为这话是叶忒罗说的，而叶忒罗代表与摩西所代表的神性真理合一的神性良善，至于它们的合一，可参看前文（<a href="8666.htm">8666</a>节）；因此，“听我的声音”表示由于合一的一致。要知道，当良善与真理联结起来时，每一个事物里面都有一致性，就是良善与真理并真理与良善的一致性。原因在于，良善真理相辅相成，真理与良善相辅相成，以致这二者为一。因为这真理确认良善所意愿的；这良善则意愿真理视之为真理的；这二者同时做这些事。良善与真理的情况类似于意愿与理解力的情况；意愿所意愿和热爱的，理解力就思想并确认之，反之亦然。这两种情况之所以相似，是因为良善属于意愿，真理属于理解力。那些被主通过良善引导的人就处于刚才 （<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）所说的这种状态。</p>

Now hear my voice. That this signifies agreement from the union, is evident from the signification of "hearing a voice," as being obedience, but here agreement, because it is said by Jethro, by whom 
is represented the Divine good united to the Divine truth which is represented by Moses (that they are united, see n. 8666); consequently by "hear my voice" is signified agreement from the union. Be it 
known that when good and truth have been conjoined, there is agreement in each and all things, namely, of good with truth and of truth with good. The reason is that good is of truth and truth is of 
good, and thus these two are one; for what good wills, this truth confirms; and what truth perceives as truth, this good wills, and both together do. The case is similar with good and truth as with the 
will and the understanding; what the will wills and loves, this the understanding thinks and confirms, and vice versa. That these two are alike is because good is of the will, and truth is of the understanding. 
In such a state are they who are led of the Lord by means of good (of which just above, n. 8701). </p>

'Now hear my voice' means agreement as a result of union. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing a voice' as obedience. But in this instance agreement is meant since the words are spoken by Jethro, 
who represents Divine Good united to Divine Truth, which is represented by Moses (regarding their being united, see above in <a href="8666.htm">8666</a>), and therefore 'hear my voice' means agreement as a result of union. 
It should be recognized that when good and truth have been joined together, there is agreement in every single respect, that is to say, agreement of good with truth and of truth with good. The reason 
for this is that good complements truth, and truth complements good, so that the two are one. What good desires, truth endorses, and what truth perceives as true, good desires; and both do these things 
simultaneously. The situation with them is similar to that with will and understanding, in that what the will desires and loves, the understanding thinks and endorses, and vice versa. The reason 
why the situation with them is similar is that good belongs to the will and truth to the understanding. This is the kind of state attained by those whom the Lord leads by means of good, dealt with immediately 
above in <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>. </p>

</p><b>8702.</b>
`Nunc audi vocem meam': quod significet ex unione consensum, constat ex significatione `audire vocem' quod sit oboedientia, hic autem consensus, quia dicitur a `Jethrone,' per quem repraesentatur Divinum 
Bonum unitum Divino Vero, quod repraesentatur per `Moschen'; {1}quod unita sint, videatur supra n. 8666; inde per `audi vocem meam' significatur ex unione consensus.  Sciendum, cum bonum et verum 
conjuncta sunt, quod consensus sit in omnibus et singulis, nempe boni cum vero et veri cum bono; causa est quia bonum est veri, et verum boni, ac ita duo illa sunt unum, nam quod bonum vult, hoc confirmat 
verum, et quod verum ut verum percipit, hoc bonum vult, ac utrumque simul facit; cum his se similiter habet ut cum voluntate et intellectu; quod voluntas vult et amat, hoc intellectus cogitat et 
confirmat, ac vice versa; quod haec cum illis similia sint, est quia bonum est voluntatis, et verum est intellectus; in tali statu sunt qui per bonum a Domino ducuntur, de quo mox supra n. 8701. 	@1
