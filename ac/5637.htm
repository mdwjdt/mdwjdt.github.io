<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5637.</strong>“起身下到埃及”表上升，以便从记忆知识的内层事物那里获得生命。这从“起身”“下到”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：“起身”是指上升到属灵生命的事物那里（参看<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2785.htm">2785</a>，<a href="2912.htm">2912</a>，<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>，<a href="3171.htm">3171</a>，<a href="4103.htm">4103</a>，<a href="4881.htm">4881</a>节）；“下到”是指获得生命，因为“下到”在此含有和前面这句话，即“你打发童子与我同去，我们就起身去，好叫我们都得存活，不至于死”（43:8）差不多的意思，这句话表示照着层级所进入的属灵生命（<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>节）；“埃及”是指记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>-<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节），在此是指记忆知识的内层事物，因为“约瑟”所代表的属灵层的属天层在那里；这就是为何接下来经上直接说他们“站在约瑟面前”。<br />记忆知识的内层事物就是属世心智中的属灵事物；当属世心智中的记忆知识被天堂之光光照时，属灵事物就在属世心智中；当人在基于圣言的教义事物上有了真正的信仰时，它们就被天堂之光光照；当他处于仁之良善时，便拥有真正的信仰；因为那时，仁之良善就像火焰那样光照真理，由此光照记忆知识。这就是它们如何获得自己所拥有的属灵之光。由此可见何谓记忆知识的内层事物。</p>

And rose up, and went down to Egypt. That this signifies elevation to life to be gained by them from the interior things of memory-knowledges is evident from the signification of "rising up," as being 
elevation to the things of spiritual life (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); and from the signification of "going down," as being to life to be gained by them, for "going down" here 
involves the same as was meant before by the words, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, and we will live, and not die" (verse 8), by which is signified spiritual life according to degrees 
(n. 5605); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966), here the interior things of memory-knowledges, because the celestial of the 
spiritual which is represented by Joseph was there; wherefore it is presently said that they "stood before Joseph." The interior things of memory-knowledges are spiritual things in the natural mind, and 
spiritual things are there when the memory-knowledges there are enlightened by the light of heaven, and they are so enlightened when the man has faith in the doctrinal things that are from the Word, 
and he has this faith when he is in the good of charity; for then truths and thereby memory-knowledges are enlightened by the good of charity as by a flame. From this they have their spiritual light. 
Hence it may be seen what is meant by the interior things of memory-knowledges. </p>

'And they rose up, and went down to Egypt' means a raising up so as to acquire life from the interior areas of factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'rising up' as a raising up to the 
things that belong to spiritual life, dealt with in <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2785.htm">2785</a>, <a href="2912.htm">2912</a>, <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, <a href="3171.htm">3171</a>, <a href="4103.htm">4103</a>, <a href="4881.htm">4881</a>; from the meaning of 'going down' as to acquire life, for 'going down' here implies much the same as the words 
used previously in verse 8 - 'Send the boy with me, and we will rise up and go, and we will live and not die' - which mean spiritual life entered into by degrees, dealt with in <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>; and from the 
meaning of 'Egypt' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, in this case the interior areas of such knowledge since the celestial of the spiritual represented by 'Joseph' 
is there, which is why the statement 'and stood before Joseph' follows directly after. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The interior areas of factual knowledge are facts existing in the natural which are spiritual ones; 
and they are spiritual ones there when such facts in the natural have been illuminated by the light of heaven. They have been so illuminated by the light of heaven when a person has a real belief in 
teachings that are based on the Word; and he has a real belief in these when the good of charity is present in him. For then the good of charity, like a flame, sheds light on the truths and so on the 
facts he knows. This is how they get the spiritual light they possess. From this one may see what is meant by the interior areas of factual knowledge. </p>

</p><b>5637.</b>
`Et surrexerunt et descenderunt Aegyptum':  quod significet elevationem ad vitam sibi comparandam ex interioribus scientificorum, constat a significatione `surgere' quod sit elevatio ad illa quae sunt 
vitae spiritualis, de qua n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881; a significatione `descendere' quod sit ad vitam sibi comparandam; involvit enim hic `descendere' simile quod prius, quo nempe 
per haec verba `Mitte puerum mecum, et surgemus, et ibimus, et vivemus, et non moriemur', {1}vers. 8, per quae significatur vita spiritualis secundum gradus, de quibus n. 5605; et a significatione `Aegypti' 
quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966, hic interiora scientificorum quia ibi caeleste spiritualis quod per `Josephum' repraesentatur; quapropter mox dicitur 
`et steterunt coram Josepho'. [2] Interiora scientificorum sunt quae spiritualia in naturali, et spiritualia ibi sunt quando scientifica ibi illustrata sunt a luce caeli, et tunc illustrata sunt a luce 
caeli cum homo fidem habet doctrinalibus quae e Verbo, et tunc fidem habet cum in bono charitatis est; tunc enim a bono charitatis sicut a flamma illustrantur vera, et sic scientifica, haec inde spiritualem 
suam lucem habent; inde constare potest quid per interiora scientificorum intelligitur. @1 vers. 8 after prius$ </p>
