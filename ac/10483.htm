<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10483节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10483</strong>.“摩西就站在营门口”表地狱的开口所在之处。这从“摩西”的代表，以及“门口”和“营”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指内在，如前所述（<a href="10468.htm">10468</a>节）；“门口”是指一个开口所在之处，如下文所述；“营”是指地狱（<a href="10458.htm">10458</a>节）。<br />摩西之所以站在营门口，没有进入营本身，是为了可以代表内在之物不能进入地狱；因为“摩西”代表内在之物，“营”代表地狱。事实上，所有在地狱里的人，其兴趣都在于与内在之物分离的外在事物，因为自我之爱和尘世之爱在他们里面进行统治。因此，内在之物不能进入那里，因为它不被接受。相反，那里的人有的直接弃绝它，有的窒息它、掐灭它，有的歪曲它。无论你说“内在之物”，还是说“天堂”，都是一回事；因为天堂构成内在之物，不仅构成圣言的内在，还构成教会和敬拜的内在；进而构成处于属天和属灵之爱，也就是对主之爱和对邻之仁的人的内在。<br />必须简要说明这“营门口”所表示地狱开口是什么。每个地狱周围都是封闭的，但上面会根据必要性和需求打开。这个开口通向灵人界，灵人界在天堂与地狱的中间，因为灵人界是地狱的上界，天堂的下界（<a href="5852.htm">5852</a>节）。之所以说它们根据必要性和需求打开，是因为每个世人都有来自地狱的灵人和来自天堂的天使与他同在。来自地狱的灵人存在于他的肉体和世俗之爱中，来自天堂的天使则存在于他的属天和属灵之爱中；因为没有灵人，此人根本不可能拥有生命。如果灵人从他那里被移走，他就会像一块石头那样倒地而死。所以为叫人能照着他的爱生活，地狱有必要根据需求打开，诸如被类似的爱所主宰的那类灵人就从那里出来到他这里。<br />这种开口就是“阴间的门（即地狱之门）”所表示的，我有几次被允许看见这类开口。主通过天使守护这些门，以防止超出需求的灵人从那里出来。由此明显可知，在圣言中，“阴间的门（即地狱之门）”和“仇敌的城门”表示什么，如马太福音：<br />耶稣对彼得说，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上，阴间的门不能胜过它。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">16:18</a>）<br />“阴间的门不能胜过”表示地狱将不敢出来摧毁信之真理；“教会建造所在的磐石”是指从主所获得的对主之信，这信就是仁之信，因为信植根于仁，并因此与它构成一体。“磐石”表示这信（参看创世记22章预言，以及<a href="8581.htm">8581</a>，<a href="10438.htm">10438</a>节）；真正的信在于仁（<a href="654.htm">654</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>，<a href="1176.htm">1176</a>，<a href="1608.htm">1608</a>，<a href="2228.htm">2228</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="2349.htm">2349</a>，<a href="2419.htm">2419</a>，<a href="2839.htm">2839</a>，<a href="3324.htm">3324</a>，<a href="4368.htm">4368</a>，<a href="6348.htm">6348</a>，<a href="7039.htm">7039</a>，<a href="7623.htm">7623</a>-<a href="7627.htm">7627</a>，<a href="7752.htm">7752</a>-<a href="7762.htm">7762</a>，<a href="8530.htm">8530</a>，<a href="9154.htm">9154</a>，<a href="9783.htm">9783</a>，<a href="9924.htm">9924</a>节）。<br />这句话所表相同：<br />你的种必得着仇敌的城门。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创22.17.htm">22:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.60.htm">24:60</a>）<br />“得着仇敌的城门”表示摧毁来自地狱的邪恶和虚假；这一点也由驱逐和摧毁迦南地的民族来代表；因为那里的民族代表来自地狱的邪恶和虚假（参看<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>，<a href="1868.htm">1868</a>，<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>，<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>，<a href="8054.htm">8054</a>，<a href="8317.htm">8317</a>，<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>，<a href="9327.htm">9327</a>节）。以及诗篇：<br />坐在城门口的密谋反对我；喝烈酒的唱歌、跳舞。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.12.htm">69:12</a>）<br /><br />箭袋充满的人便为有福。他们在城门口和仇敌说话的时候，必不至于羞愧。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.5.htm">127:5</a>）<br />但“城门”在正面意义上表示通向天堂的开口。如诗篇：<br />众城门哪，你们要抬起头来！永久的门户，你们要被举起！那荣耀的王将要进来。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.7.htm">24:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此外，在圣言中，“城门”表示通过真理和良善进入天堂和教会的入口，以及与人同在的真理和良善的流注。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10483</b></p><p><b>10483.</b>
And Moses stood in the gate of the camp. That this signifies where the opening to hell is, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the internal (of which above, n. 10468); from the signification 
of "in the gate," as being where there is an opening (of which below); and from the signification of "the camp," as being hell (n. 10458). The reason why Moses stood in the gate of the camp, 
and did not enter into the camp itself, was in order that it might be represented that what is internal cannot enter into hell; for by Moses was represented what is internal, and by the camp was represented 
hell. For all who are in hell are in things external separate from what is internal, because they are in the loves of self and of the world, and therefore what is internal cannot enter there, 
because it is not received, but is at once rejected by some who are there; with some it is suffocated and extinguished; and with others it is perverted. Whether you say "what is internal," or "heaven," 
it is the same, because heaven is in what is internal; it is in the internal of the Word, and in the internal of the church and of worship; consequently it is in the internal of the man who is in celestial 
and spiritual love; that is, in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor. [2] It shall be briefly told what is this opening of hell which is signified by "the gate of this camp." Every 
hell is closed round about; but is opened above according to necessity and need. This opening is into the world of spirits, which world is midway between heaven and hell, for there the hells terminate 
upward, and the heavens downward (n. 5852). It is said that they are opened according to necessity and need, because every man has with him spirits from hell and angels from heaven. The spirits 
from hell are in his bodily and worldly loves, and the angels from heaven are in his heavenly and spiritual loves, for without the presence of spirits no man can possibly live. If spirits were removed 
from him, he would fall down as dead as a stone. Consequently in order that man may have life according to his loves, the hells are of necessity opened, and according to need, and from them such spirits 
come forth to him as are in similar loves.  [3] This opening is what is meant by "the gate of hell," and such openings it has sometimes been granted me to see. The gates are guarded by the Lord by 
means of angels, to prevent more spirits coming forth than is needful. From this it is evident what is signified in the Word by "the gates of hell," and by "the gates of enemies," as in Matthew: </p>
<p>  
   Jesus said unto Peter, Upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matt. 16:18); </p>
<p>"the gates of hell not prevailing" denotes that the hells will not dare 
to go forth and destroy the truths of faith; "the rock upon which the church is built" denotes faith from the Lord in the Lord, which faith is the faith of charity, because charity is in this faith 
and thus is one with it. (That a "rock" denotes this faith may be seen in the preface to the twenty-second chapter of Genesis, and also in n. 8581, 10438; and that real faith is charity, in n. 654, 
1162, 1176, 1608, 2228, 2343, 2349, 2419, 2839, 3324, 4368, 6348, 7039, 7623-7627, 7752-7762, 8530, 9154, 9224, 9783.) [4] The like is also signified by the words: </p>
<p>     Thy seed shall inherit the gate 
of thine enemies (Gen. 22:17; 24:60); </p>
<p>"to inherit the gate of enemies" denotes to destroy the evils and falsities which are from hell; and this was also represented by the driving out and destruction 
of the nations in the land of Canaan; for the nations there represented evils and falsities which are from hell (see n. 1573, 1574, 1868, 4818, 6306, 8054, 8317, 9320, 9327). Also in David: </p>
<p>     
They that dwell in the gate plot against me; they that drink strong drink sing and dance (Ps. 69:12).      Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver; they shall not be ashamed, for they shall speak 
with the enemies in the gate (Ps. 127:5). [5] But in a good sense "gates" denote an opening into heaven, as in David: </p>
<p>     Lift up your head, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; 
and the King of glory shall come in (Ps. 24:7-10). Moreover by "gates" in the Word is signified entrance into heaven and into the church by means of truth and good; and also the influx of truth and 
good with man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10483</b></p><p><b>10483.</b>
'And Moses stood in the gate of the camp' means where the opening to hell is situated. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the internal, dealt with above in <a href="10468.htm">10468</a>; from the meaning of 
'in the gate' as where the opening is situated, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the camp' as hell, also dealt with above, in <a href="10458.htm">10458</a>. The reason why Moses stood in the gate of the camp and did 
not go inside the actual camp was in order that the impossibility for the internal to enter hell might be represented; for Moses represented the internal and the camp represented hell. The interest 
of all those in hell lies in external things separated from what is internal, because self-love and love of the world rule within them. Therefore what is internal cannot go in there since it is not received. 
Instead some who are there immediately reject it, some smother it and snuff it out, and some pervert it. Whether you say the internal or heaven, it amounts to the same thing; for heaven constitutes 
what is internal, not only the internal side of the Word but also the internal side of the Church and of worship, consequently the internal of the person who has celestial and spiritual love reigning 
within him, that is, love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What hell's opening is, meant by 'the gate' of this camp, must be stated briefly. Each hell is closed all the way 
around it, but it is opened above as necessity and need demand. It is an opening into the world of spirits, the world that lies midway between heaven and hell; for that world serves as the upper boundary 
of the hells and as the lower boundary of the heavens, <a href="5852.htm">5852</a>. The reason for saying that they are opened as necessity and need demand is that each person in the world has spirits present with him 
from hell, and angels from heaven. The spirits from hell are present in his bodily and worldly loves, and the angels from heaven in those which are celestial and spiritual; for without the spirits the 
person can have no life at all. If the spirits were taken away from him he would drop dead as a stone. Consequently to enable a person to lead a life in keeping with his loves the hells are opened of 
necessity and as need demands, and from there such spirits come out to him as are ruled by loves similar to his.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That opening is what should be understood by the gate of hell. I have been allowed 
several times to see such openings. They are gates which the Lord guards by means of angels, to stop more spirits than are needed from coming out of there. From this it is evident what 'the gates 
of hell' and 'the gates of enemies' mean in the Word, as in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to Peter, On this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The 
gates of hell will not prevail' means that the hells will not dare to come out and destroy the truths of faith, 'the rock' on which the Church stands being faith in the Lord received from the Lord. 
This faith is the faith of charity because it is rooted in charity and for that reason makes one with it.  </p>
<p>'The rock' means that faith, see Preface to Genesis <a href="22.htm">22</a>, and also <a href="8581.htm">8581</a>,  <a href="10438.htm">10438</a>.  Real 
faith consists in charity, <a href="654.htm">654</a>, <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, <a href="1176.htm">1176</a>, <a href="1608.htm">1608</a>, <a href="2228.htm">2228</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="2349.htm">2349</a>, <a href="2419.htm">2419</a>, <a href="2839.htm">2839</a>, <a href="3324.htm">3324</a>, <a href="4368.htm">4368</a>, <a href="6348.htm">6348</a>, <a href="7039.htm">7039</a>, <a href="7623.htm">7623</a>-<a href="7627.htm">7627</a>, <a href="7752.htm">7752</a>-<a href="7762.htm">7762</a>, <a href="8530.htm">8530</a>, <a href="9154.htm">9154</a>, <a href="9783.htm">9783</a>, <a href="9924.htm">9924</a>.  </p>

<p><b>[4]</b>
 The like is also meant by your seed will 
inherit the gate of their enemies, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2022:17;%2024:60&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 22:17; 24:60</a>. 'Inheriting the gate of their enemies' means destroying evils and falsities which come from hell. This was also represented by driving out and destroying 
the nations in the land of Canaan; for the nations there represented evils and falsities which come from hell, see <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>, <a href="1868.htm">1868</a>, <a href="4818.htm">4818</a>, <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>, <a href="8054.htm">8054</a>, <a href="8317.htm">8317</a>, <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>, <a href="9327.htm">9327</a>. Also in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Those 
who dwell in the gate plot against me; those who drink strong wine sing songs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver. They will not be put to shame, for 
they will speak with enemies in the gate. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20127:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 127:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Gates' in the good sense however stands for the opening into heaven. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, O eternal doors, 
and the King of glory will come in. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2024:7-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 24:7-10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In addition admission into heaven and into the Church through truth and good is meant in the Word by 'gates', and also good and truth flowing 
in and present with a person.  </p>

`Et stetit Moscheh in porta castrorum': quod significet ubi apertura ad infernum, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit internum, de qua (x)supra n. 10,468, ex significatione `in porta' quod 
sit ubi apertura, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `castrorum' quod sint infernum, de qua etiam Supra n. 10,458.  Quod Moscheh in porta castrorum steterit (c)et non intraverit ipsa castra, erat 
causa ut repraesentaretur quod internum non possit intrare in infernum, per Moschen enim repraesentabatur internum, et per castra infernum; omnes enim qui in inferno sunt in externis separatis ab interno 
sunt, quoniam in amoribus sui et mundi; quapropter internum {1} illuc non potest intrare (t), non enim recipitur, sed apud quosdam (o)qui ibi, rejicitur statim, apud quosdam suffocatur et exstinguitur, 
et apud quosdam pervertitur; sive dicas internum sive caelum, idem est, nam caelum est in interno, tam in interno Verbi quam in interno Ecclesiae, et cultus, consequenter in interno hominis qui 
in amore caelesti et spirituali, hoc est, in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga Proximum (o)est. 	[2] Quid apertura inferni, quae significatur per `portam castrorum horum,' paucis dicetur: unumquodvis 
infernum clausum est circumcirca, sed {2} (t)aperitur supra secundum necessitatem et indigentiam; apertura illa est {3} in mundum spirituum, (o)qui mundus {4} est medius inter caelum et infernum, 
ibi enim inferna a superiore terminantur, ac caeli ab inferiore, {5} n. 5852; dicitur quod aperiantur secundum necessitatem et indigentiam, quoniam unusquisque homo apud se spiritus habet ab inferno, 
(c)ac angelos e caelo; spiritus ab inferno sunt in amoribus ejus corporeis et mundanis, et angeli e caelo in amoribus {6} caelestibus et spiritualibus, (o)nam homo absque spiritibus nequaquam vivere 
potest; si (x)auferrentur ab illo spiritus, decumberet mortuus sicut lapis; inde ut vita homini sit secundum ejus amores, aperiuntur {7} ex necessitate et secundum indigentiam inferna, unde {8} tales 
spiritus ad illum exeunt qui in similibus amoribus sunt. 	[3] Apertura illa est quae intelligitur per portam inferni; tales aperturas aliquoties mihi videre datum est; custodiuntur illae portae a Domino 
per angelos, ne plures inde spiritus exeant quam secundum opus.  Inde patet quid per `portas inferni' et per `portas hostium' significatur in Verbo, ut apud Matthaeum,      	Jesus dixit ad Petrum, 
Super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam Meam, et portae inferni non praevalebunt illi, xvi 18; </p>
<p>`portae inferni non praevalebunt' est quod (t)inferna non ausura sint exire et destruere vera fidei, `petra 
super qua Ecclesia' est fides a Domino in Dominum, quae fides est fides charitatis, quia in hac et cum hac ita unum; quod `petra' sit illa fides, videatur in Praefatione ad Gen. xxii, ac n. 8581, 
10,438, et quod (o)ipsa fides sit charitas, n. 654, 1162, 1176, 1608, 2228, (x)2343, 2349, 2419, 2839, 3324, 4368, 6348, 7039, 7623-7627, 7752-7762, 8530, 9154, 9924, 9783. 	[4] Simile etiam significatur 
per quod semen tuum hereditabit portas {9} hostium suorum {10}, Gen. xxii 17, xxiv 60; `hereditare portam hostium' est destruere mala et falsa quae ab inferno; quod etiam repraesentatum est per 
(o)expulsionem et destructionem gentium in terra Canaane, gentes (o)enim ibi repraesentabant mala et falsa quae ab inferno, (o)videatur n. 1573, 1574, 1868, (o)4818, 6306, (o)8054, 8317, 9320, 9327: 
tum apud Davidem,      	Excogitant in me habitatores portae, modulantur bibentes siceram, Ps. lxix 13 [A.V. 12]: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      	Beatus vir qui implevit pharetram suam; non pudefient, quia loquentur 
cum hostibus in porta, Ps. cxxvii (x)5. 	[5] `Portae' autem in bono sensu pro apertura in caelum: {11} apud Davidem,      	Attollite, portae, capita vestra, et extollimini, ostia aeterna, et intrabit 
Rex gloriae, Ps. xxiv 7-10. Praeterea per `portas' in Verbo significatur introitus in caelum et (o)in Ecclesiam per verum et bonum, et quoque influxus veri et boni apud hominem. @1 After Potest$ @2
