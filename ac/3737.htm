<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3737节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3737.</strong>“耶和华必作我的神”表神性属世层也是耶和华。这从论述主的人身与其神性融合的至高内义上的整个思路清楚可知。但为了明白这层意义，思维必须从关于雅各的历史中抽离出来，并专注于主的神性人身，在这种情况下则专注于祂的神性属世层，这神性属世层由雅各来代表。人身本身，如前面反复阐述的，是由等同于内在人的理性层和等同于外在人的属世层，以及肉体构成的；而肉体作为工具或最外层的器官服务属世层，以便活在这个世界上，并通过属世层服务理性层，再通过这理性层服务神性。由于主来到这个世界，是为了祂可以使自己里面的整个人身变成神性，并照着神序这样做；还由于雅各代表主的属世层，他的寄居生活在至高意义上代表主如何使祂的属世层变成神性，故此处经上所说“我平平安安地回到我父亲的家，耶和华必作我的神”这句话就表示主的人身与其神性的融合，并且就神性属世层而言，祂还要通过神性本质与人身本质，并人身本质与神性本质的融合而成为耶和华。这种融合不能理解为两个作为独立个体的人仅通过爱结合时所存在的那种融合，就像父爱子，子爱父时父与子的结合；或像兄弟爱兄弟，或朋友爱朋友时两个人的结合。确切地说，它是真正地融为一体，以便祂的两种本质不再是二，而为一，如主所反复教导的。由于它们为一，故主的整个人身就是神性存在或耶和华（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>节）。</p>

And Jehovah shall be to me for God. That this signifies that the Divine natural also was Jehovah, is evident from the series of things in the supreme internal sense, which treats of the unition of the 
Lord's Human with His Divine; but in order that this sense may appear, the thought must be abstracted from the history of Jacob and be kept fixed on the Lord's Divine Human, and in this case on His 
Divine natural, which is represented by Jacob. The human itself, as before repeatedly stated, consists of the rational, which is the same as the internal man, and of the natural, which is the same as 
the external man, and also of the body, which serves the natural as a means or outermost organ for living in the world, and through the natural serves the rational, and moreover through the rational, 
serves the Divine. Inasmuch as the Lord came into the world in order that He might make the whole human in Himself Divine, and this according to Divine order; and as by Jacob is represented the Lord's 
natural, and by his life of sojourning, in the supreme sense, how the Lord made His natural Divine, therefore here, where it is said, "if I shall return in peace to the house of my father, Jehovah shall 
be to me for God," there is signified the unition of the Lord's Human with His Divine, and that as to the Divine natural also He should be Jehovah, through the unition of the Divine Essence with the 
Human, and of the Human with the Divine. This unition is not to be understood as being a unition of two who are distinct from each other, and conjoined merely by love; as a father with a son, when 
the father loves the son and the son the father; or as when a brother loves a brother, or a friend a friend; but it is a real unition into a one in order that they may be not two but one (as the Lord 
also repeatedly teaches); and because they are a one, therefore the whole Human of the Lord is the Divine being or Jehovah (see n. 1343, 1736, 2156, 2329, 2447, 2921, 3023, 3035). </p>

'Then Jehovah will be my God' means that the Divine Natural also is Jehovah. This becomes clear from the train of thought in the highest internal sense in which the subject is the Lord's Human when united 
to His Divine. But in order to see this sense thought must be detached from the historical events concerning Jacob and fixed on the Lord's Divine Human, in this case on His Divine Natural, which 
'Jacob' represents. The human itself, as stated several times already, consists of the rational, which is the same as the internal man, and of the natural, which is the same as the external man, as well 
as of the body, which serves the natural as the means or outermost organ for living in the world, and through the natural serves the rational, and so on through the rational serves the Divine. Now 
because the Lord came into the world to make the entire Human within Him Divine, doing so according to Divine order; and because 'Jacob' represents the Lord's Natural and his life as a sojourner represents 
in the highest sense how the Lord made Divine His Natural; the statement here 'If I come back in peace to my father's house, then Jehovah will be my God' means the Lord's Human when united to His 
Divine. Furthermore that statement means that even as regards the Divine Natural also He was to be Jehovah through the Divine Essence united to the Human Essence, and the Human Essence united to the 
Divine Essence. One does not mean by this a union such as exists when two people who are separate individuals are bound together solely through love, as for example in the case of a father and a son, 
when the father loves the son and the son loves the father, or as when a brother loves a brother, or a friend loves a friend. Rather it is a real uniting together into a single whole, so that His two 
Essences are not two but one, which is also the Lord's teaching in many places. And being one, the whole of the Lord's Human is the Divine Being (Esse) or Jehovah, see <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, </p>

`Et erit Jehovah mihi in Deum': quod significet quod Divinum Naturale etiam Jehovah, constare potest ex serie rerum in sensu interno supremo, in quo agitur de unitione Humani Domini cum Divino Ipsius; 
sed ut hic sensus appareat, abstrahenda est cogitatio ab historico de Jacobo, et tenenda in Divino Humano Domini, et hic in Divino Naturali Ipsius, quod per `Jacobum' repraesentatur. Ipsum humanum, 
ut aliquoties prius dictum, constat ex rationali, quod idem est cum interno homine, et ex naturali, quod idem est cum externo homine, et quoque ex corpore, quod naturali inservit pro medio seu 
extimo organo vivendi in mundo, et per naturale inservit rationali, et porro per rationale inservit Divino. Dominus quia venit in mundum ut Divinum faceret totum Humanum in Se, et hoc secundum Divinum 
ordinem, et per `Jacobum' repraesentatur Naturale Domini, et per ejus peregrinationis vitam in sensu supremo, quomodo Dominus Naturale Suum Divinum fecit, ideo hic ubi dicitur `si rediero in 
pace ad domum patris mei, erit Jehovah mihi in Deum,' significatur unitio Humani Domini cum Divino Ipsius, et quod quoad Divinum Naturale etiam erit Jehovah {1}per unitionem Divinae Essentiae cum 
Humana, et {2}Humanae cum Divina:{3} non intelligitur unitio qualis est duorum qui inter se distincti sunt, et solum per amorem conjuncti, sicut pater cum filio, cum pater amat filium et filius patrem, 
aut sicut {4}cum frater amat fratrem, aut sicut amicus amicum, sed est realis unitio in unum, ut non duo sint, sed unum, quod etiam Dominus pluribus in locis docet; et quia unum, etiam omne Humanum 
Domini est Divinum Esse seu Jehovah, videatur n. 1343, 1736, 2156, 2329, 2447, 2921, 3023, 3035. @1 A inserts ; and has Per$ @2 Humana I$ @3 A has ;$ @4 i est$ </p>
