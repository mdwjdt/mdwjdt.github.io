<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1050．“凡有血肉的一切活的灵魂”表整个人类。这一点从“凡有血肉的活的灵魂”的含义清楚可知。人皆都因着他里面的活物而被称为活的灵魂。若人里面没有某种活物，即没有某种纯真、仁爱和怜悯，或相似、同类性质，他决不能存活，更不用说作为一个人活着。人在婴儿和儿童期就从主那里接受这点纯真、仁爱和怜悯，这可从婴儿和儿童期的状态明显看出来。人那时所接受的事物会保存在他里面，所保存的事物在圣言中被称为“余留”，就是人里面唯独属于主之物。当人成年时，如此保存的这些余留就是使他有可能成为一个人的那个东西。关于这些余留，可参看前文（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>-<a href="563.htm">563</a>，<a href="576.htm">576</a>节）。<br />人在婴儿和儿童期所拥有的纯真、仁爱和怜悯的状态能使人成为一个人，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来，即人不象动物那样生来就能进行生命活动，而是一切都要学习。然后，他所学到的东西通过训练变成习惯，可以说对他而言变得很自然。若不学习，人甚至不会走路、说话，其它事也一样。对人而言，这些活动通过运用可以说变得很自然。纯真、仁爱和怜悯的状态也是如此，它们自婴儿时就被灌输到人里面。没有这些状态，他连动物都不如。然而，这些状态是人学不来的状态，而是他从主那里所接受的白白的恩赐，主将它们保存在人里面。它们连同信之真理就是所谓的余留，唯独属于主。人成年后越是摧毁这些状态，就越成为一个死人。当人正重生时，这些状态就是重生的开始，他会被带入这些状态；因为主藉着这些余留作工，如前所述。<br />在此被称为“凡有血肉的活的灵魂”的，就是存留在每个人身上的这些余留。“凡有血肉的”表每个人，因而表整个人类，这一点从圣言各处“血肉”的含义明显看出来（参看<a href="574.htm">574</a>节）。如马太福音：<br />若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.22.htm">24:22</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.20.htm">13:20</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，父啊，愿你荣耀你的儿子，正如你曾赐给他权柄，管理凡有血气的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">2</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华的荣耀必然显现，凡有血气的必一同看见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.5.htm">40:5</a>）<br /><br />凡有血气的，必都知道我耶和华是你的救主（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.26.htm">49:26</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1050.</strong> The symbolism of and every living soul within all flesh as the entire human race can be seen from the symbolism of the living soul within all flesh.<br />Each of us is called a living soul from a living quality in us. Not one of us can live — still less live as a human being — if we do not have something living inside us. In other words, we need to have a measure of innocence, charity, and mercy, or at least something that resembles or approximates it. This measure of innocence, charity, and mercy is something we receive from the Lord in childhood and adolescence, as can be seen from the state of children and the state of adolescents. What we receive at those ages is preserved in us. What is preserved in us is what the Word calls a remnant, or survivors, and it is the Lord's alone in us. These preserved traces are what makes it possible for us to be human when we arrive at adulthood. For more on the remnant, or remaining traces, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_561" target=_top>561</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_562" target=_top>562</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_563" target=_top>563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576" target=_top>576</a>.<br />[2] The fact that the states of innocence, charity, and mercy that we experienced in early childhood and in the years when we were growing up make it possible for us to be human is plainly evident from this: We are not born into any life skills, the way brute animals are, but must learn each and every one of them, and what we learn is then turned into habit and second nature by our practicing it. Unless we learn how, we cannot even walk, or talk, or do anything else. When we practice these activities, they become almost instinctive to us. The case is the same with a state of innocence, charity, and mercy — virtues that we likewise absorb from early childhood on; if those states were not present inside us, we would be much lower than animals. But they are not acquired by education. We receive them as gifts from the Lord, who preserves them in us. These states, along with religious truth, are what are called a remnant, and are the Lord's alone. To the extent that we suffocate them during adulthood, we become dead.<br />When we are being reborn, these states are the starting points of the process, and we are led into them, because the Lord works through the remnant, as noted before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_635" target=_top>635</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711" target=_top>711</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_737" target=_top>737:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_857" target=_top>857</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_977#subsection-2-2" target=_top>977:2</a>].<br />[3] This remnant in each individual is what is being called the living soul within all flesh.<br />The symbolism of all flesh as every individual and so the entire human race can be seen from the symbolism of flesh throughout the Word. (See the illustrations offered at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_574" target=_top>574</a>.) In Matthew, for example:<br />If those days were not shortened, no flesh would be rescued.

And every living soul of all flesh. That this signifies the whole human race, is evident from the signification of "living soul of all flesh." Every man is called a living soul from what is living in 
him. No man can ever live, still less as a man, if he has not something living in him, that is, if he has not something of innocence, of charity, and of mercy, or something from it like or emulating 
it. This something of innocence, charity, and mercy man receives from the Lord during infancy and childhood, as is evident from the state of infants and also from that of childhood. What the man then 
receives is preserved in him, and the things that are preserved are called in the Word "remains" and are of the Lord alone in the man. What is thus preserved is what causes the man, when he comes to adult 
age, to be capable of being a man. (Concerning remains see what is said above, n. 468, 530, 560-563, 576.)  [2] That the states of innocence, charity, and mercy which a man has had in infancy and 
during the years of childhood, cause him to be capable of being a man, is plainly evident from this, that man is not born into any exercise of life, as brute animals are, but has everything to learn, 
and what he learns becomes by exercise habitual, and thus as it were natural to him. He cannot even walk or speak until he learns, and so with everything else. By use these things become as it were 
natural to him. And such is the case also with the states of innocence, charity, and mercy with which he is in like manner imbued from infancy, and without which states he would be much viler than a brute. 
Yet these are states which man does not learn, but receives as a gift from the Lord, and which the Lord preserves in him. Together with the truths of faith, they are also what are called "remains" 
and are of the Lord alone. Insofar as a man in adult age extinguishes these states, he becomes dead. When a man is being regenerated, these states are the beginnings of regeneration, and he is led 
into them; for the Lord works through the remains, as already stated.  [3] These remains with every man are what are here called the "living soul of all flesh." That "all flesh" signifies every man, 
and thus the whole human race, is evident from the signification of "flesh" everywhere in the Word. (See what was shown in n. 574.) As in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Except those days should be shortened, no flesh 
would be saved (Matt. 24:22; Mark 13:20). In John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Father glorify Thy Son, as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh (John 17:2). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     And the glory of Jehovah shall 
be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together (Isa. 40:5). And again: </p>
<p>     And all flesh shall know that I Jehovah am thy Savior (Isa. 49:26). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1050</b></p><p><b>1050.</b>
'And with every living soul in all flesh' means the entire human race. This is clear from the meaning of 'living soul in all flesh'. Every individual is called 'a living soul' from that which is living 
within him. No one can possibly live, let alone as a human being, if he does not have something living within him, that is, if he does not have some measure of 'innocence, charity, and mercy, or from 
these something of a similar or comparable nature. This measure of innocence, charity, and mercy a person receives from the Lord when he is an infant and during childhood, as becomes clear from the 
state of infants and also from that of childhood. What a person receives at that time is preserved within him, and the things that are preserved are in the Word called 'remnants', which are the Lord's 
alone with a person. These remnants that are being preserved are what make it possible for someone when he becomes adult to be a human being. Regarding these remnants, see what appears in <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>-<a href="563.htm">563</a>, <a href="576.htm">576</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That the states of innocence, charity, and mercy that have been his in infancy and in childhood years enable a person to be human is quite clear from the fact that man is not born 
as animals are, ready to perform any of life's activities, but has to learn how to do every single one. The things he learns to do then become through the performance of them habitual and so to speak 
natural to him. Man is not even able to walk, or to talk, until he learns how to do so; and the same applies to everything else. Through usage these activities become so to speak natural to him. The 
situation is the same with regard to the states of innocence, charity, and mercy with which likewise he is endowed from infancy. But for these states man would be far inferior to any animal. These states 
however are not states that man acquires by learning but ones which he receives as a free gift from the Lord, and which the Lord preserves within him. These, together with truths of faith, are what 
are also called remnants and are the Lord's alone. To the extent that a person in adult life destroys these states, he becomes a dead man. When a person is being regenerated these states are the principal 
agents of regeneration, and he is brought into these states, for, as stated already, the Lord works by means of remnants. </p>

 These remnants present with everybody are what are here called 'the 
living soul in all flesh'. That 'all flesh' means everybody and so the entire human race becomes clear from the meaning of 'flesh' in many places in the Word - see what has been shown in <a href="574.htm">574</a> - as 
in Matthew, </p>

'Et inter omnem animam vivam in omni carne': quod significet universum genus humanum, constat a significatione 'animae vivae in omni carne': omnis homo 'anima viva' dicitur ex vivo quod apud eum; nusquam 
aliquis homo vivere potest, minus ut homo, si non vivum quid apud se habeat, hoc est, nisi habeat aliquid innocentiae, charitatis et misericordiae, aut inde aliquid simile vel aemulum; hoc innocentiae, 
charitatis et misericordiae accipit homo a Domino cum infans est et cum in aetate puerili, ut constare potest a statu infantum, tUm quoque a statu pueritiae; quod homo tunc accipit, conservatur 
apud hominem; quae conservantur, vocantur in Verbo 'reliquiae,' quae solius Domini sunt apud hominem; haec quae conservantur, sunt quae faciunt ut homo dum ad adultam aetatem venit, possit esse homo; 
de quibus reliquiis videantur quae n. 468, 530, 560-563, 576. [2] Quod status innocentiae, charitatis et misericordiae quos homo habuit in infantia et in annis pueritiae, faciant quod homo possit esse 
homo, constat manifeste ex eo quod homo in nullum exercitium vitae sicut bruta animalia nascatur, sed quod omnia et singula addiscat; et quae addiscit, quod ea ex exercitio tunc trahant habitum et 
sicut naturam; ne quidem ambulare potest homo nisi addiscat, nec loqui, ita in reliquis omnibus; haec per usum fiunt ei quasi naturalia; ita se habet cum statu innocentiae, charitatis et misericordiae 
quibus similiter imbuitur ab infantia, qui status nisi adsint apud hominem, foret multo vili bruto; sed hi status sunt quos homo non addiscit, sed dono acci: a Domino, et quos apud eum Dominus conservat; 
suntque illi, et una cum veris fidei, qui appellantur reliquiae, et sunt solius Domini quantum homo in adulta aetate hos status exstinguit, tantum mortuus fit: cum regeneratur homo, sunt hi status 
principia regenerationis et in hos inducitur, nam Dominus per reliquias, ut prius dictum operatur.  [3] Hae reliquiae apud unumquemvis hominem sunt quae vocantur hic 'anima viva in omni carne': quod 
'omnis caro' significet unumquemvis hominem ac ita universum genus humanum, consta potest a significatione carnis passim in Verbo, videantur quae ostensa n. 574; ut apud Matthaeum, 	Nisi abbreviarentur 
dies isti, non conservaretur ulla caro xxiv 22; Marc. xiii 20: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Jesus dixit, Pater... glorifica Filium Tuum,... sicut dedisti Ipsi potestatem omnis carnis, xvii [1,] 2: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Revelabitur 
gloria Jehovae, et videbunt omnis caro, xl 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Cognoscent omnis caro, quod Ego Jehovah Salvator tuus,  xlix 26. </p>
