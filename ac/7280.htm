<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7280节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7280.</strong>“埃及人就要知道我是耶和华”表他们将惧怕神性。这从“知道我是耶和华”和“埃及人”的含义清楚可知：“知道我是耶和华”是指惧怕神性，如下文所述；“埃及人”是指那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人。至于那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人将要对神性所产生的惧怕，要知道，惧怕是约束并束缚地狱里的人的唯一手段。因为惧怕是正直人和恶人所共有的一种束缚；但对正直人来说，惧怕是内在的，也就是说，为他们救赎的缘故而引起的惧怕，或对他们要在灵魂上灭亡，即丧失自己灵魂的惧怕；确切地说，是对他们做任何违背良心，也就是违背构成良心的真理和良善之事的惧怕。所以他们害怕自己做任何违背公义和公平，因而违背他们邻舍的事。不过，这种惧怕在它与仁爱的情感结合的程度内，尤其在它与对主之爱结合的程度内而变成神圣的敬畏。此时，这种惧怕变得像小孩子对他们所爱父母的那种惧怕。当这种情况发生时，只要他们处于爱之良善，这种惧怕就不明显，也不会发展为焦虑。这就是圣言中多次提到的“对神的惧怕”。<br />那些恶人没有内在的惧怕，也就是说，他们不会为了救赎，因而为了良心而惧怕；因为他们在世时就已经通过他们所过的生活和支持他们生活的虚假观念而完全弃绝了这种惧怕。不过，取代这种内在惧怕的，是他们所拥有的外在惧怕；确切地说，就是对他们丧失重要地位、金钱利益和由于这些的名声的惧怕，或对他们受到法律惩罚、丧失生命的惧怕。这些就是陷入邪恶的人在世时所惧怕的事。这种人一进入来世，因无法被内在惧怕约束和束缚，故被外在惧怕束缚；这种外在惧怕通过惩罚被灌输给他们。他们由此而惧怕作恶；最终惧怕神性；不过，如前所述，这是一种外在惧怕；这种惧怕缺乏出于对良善的情感而停止作恶的任何愿望，只有出于对惩罚的恐惧而停止作恶的愿望，他们最终对这些惩罚感到恐惧。<br />由此可见，惧怕是束缚的唯一手段；并且外在惧怕，就是对惩罚的惧怕，是约束恶人的唯一手段；这就是恶人在地狱受折磨的原因。因为当恶人进入来世，他们在世上所受的外在束缚从他们身上拿走，他们只剩下自己的欲望时，他们就像野兽，只渴望掌权，毁灭凡不支持他们的人。这就是他们生活的最大快乐；因为人越爱自己，就越仇恨不支持他的其他人；人越有仇恨在自己里面，毁灭的快乐就越存在于他里面。但在世上，这快乐是隐藏的。</p>

And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. That this signifies that they shall be in fear of the Divine, is evident from the signification of "knowing that I am Jehovah," as being to be in fear 
of the Divine (of which below); and from the signification of "the Egyptians," as being those who are in falsities and infest. As regards the fear of the Divine in which they who are in falsities and 
infest will be, be it known that fear is the only means of restraining the infernals and holding them in bonds. For fear is a common bond, both for those who are upright, and for those who are evil; but 
for those who are upright the fear is internal, which is fear for the sake of salvation, namely, lest they should perish as to their souls, and so lest they should do anything contrary to conscience, 
that is, contrary to the truth and good which are of conscience; consequently they have fear lest they should do anything contrary to what is just and fair, thus contrary to the neighbor; but this 
is holy fear insofar as it is conjoined with the affection of charity, and still more as it is conjoined with love to the Lord. Fear then becomes like that of little children toward the parents whom they 
love. Then, insofar as they are in the good of love, so far the fear does not show itself; but insofar as they are not in good, so far it shows itself, and becomes anxiety. Such is the "fear of God," 
so frequently spoken of in the Word. [2] But with those who are evil there is no internal fear, namely, for the sake of salvation, and thence for the sake of conscience; for such fear they have utterly 
rejected in the world, both by their life, and by principles of falsity favoring their life; but instead of internal fear they have external fear, namely, lest they should be deprived of honors, 
of gain, or of reputation for the sake of these, lest they should be punished according to the laws, or be deprived of life. These are what are feared by men who are in evil, while they are in the world. 
As, when such men come into the other life, they cannot be restrained and held in bonds by internal fear, they are held by external fear, which is impressed on them by punishments. From this they 
are in fear of doing evil; and at last they are in fear of the Divine, but as before said, external fear, which is devoid of any desire to desist from doing evil from the affection of good, but only 
from dread of the penalties, which they at last feel horror at. [3] From all this it can now be seen that fear is the only means of holding in bonds; and that external fear, which is fear of punishments, 
is the only means of restraining the evil; and that this is the cause of the torment of the evil in hell. For when the evil come into the other life, and when the external bonds which they had in 
the world are taken away from them, and they are left to their cupidities, they are then like wild beasts, and desire nothing more than to have dominion and to destroy everyone who does not favor them. 
This is the greatest delight of their life, for insofar as anyone loves himself, so far he hates others who do not favor him; and insofar as anyone is in hatred, so far he is in the delight of destroying; 
but in the world this is hidden. </p>

'And may the Egyptians know that I am Jehovah' means that they will have a fear of the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'knowing that I am Jehovah' as having a fear of the Divine, dealt with 
below; and from the meaning of 'the Egyptians' as those who are steeped in falsities and engage in molestation. As regards the fear which those steeped in falsities and engaging in molestation will have 
of the Divine, it should be recognized that fear is the one and only means by which those in hell can be constrained and held in bonds. For fear is a bond shared by both those who are upright and 
those who are evil. But with the upright it is an inward fear, that is, fear for their salvation, or fear lest they should lose their own souls, to be exact, and on that account lest they should do anything 
contrary to conscience, that is, contrary to the truth and goodness which compose conscience. Consequently they fear lest they should do anything contrary to what is just and fair, thus contrary 
to their neighbour. But this fear becomes holy fear to the extent that it is wedded to charitable affection in them, and especially to the extent that it is wedded to love to the Lord. Such fear then 
becomes like that which young children feel towards their parents whom they love. When this happens, then so far as they are governed by the good of love fear is not apparent; but so far as they are 
not governed by good it is apparent, and develops into anxiety. This is what the fear of God is like to which the Word refers many times. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But with those who are evil there is no inward fear - 
no fear for their salvation - and therefore no fear that belongs to conscience, for in the world they completely rejected that kind of fear both by the life they led and by basic ideas of falsity that 
were used to justify it. But in place of inward fear there is with them an outward fear, the fear, to be exact, lest they should be stripped of important positions, monetary gain, and reputation on account 
of these, be legally punished, and be deprived of life. These are the things that those governed by evil fear for when they are in the world. And on entering the next life, since they cannot be 
constrained and held in bonds by inward fear, they are held in bonds by outward fear, which is instilled into them by means of punishments. These give them a fear of doing evil, which at length becomes 
a fear of the Divine, though it is, as has been stated, an outward fear, which is devoid of any wish to refrain from doing evil that is motivated by an affection for good. Any such wish is motivated 
only by a great fear of punishments, which finally they utterly dread. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may now see that fear is the one and only means by which people are held in bonds. One may see that outward 
fear, the fear of punishments, is the one and only means by which the evil are constrained, and that this is what causes the torment suffered by the evil in hell. For the evil, on entering the next 
life, when the outward bonds which they had in the world are taken away from them and they are left to their own desires, are like wild beasts, simply longing to exercise dominion and to destroy any 
who do not support them. This is the greatest delight of their life; for to the extent that anyone loves himself he hates others who do not support him, and to the extent that each one has hatred within 
him the delight of destroying is present within him. But in the world that delight lies hidden. </p>

`Et cognoscant Aegyptii quod Ego Jehovah': quod significet quod timorem habebunt pro Divino, constat ex significatione `cognoscere quod Ego Jehovah' quod sit timorem habere pro Divino, de qua sequitur; 
et ex significatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint qui in falsis sunt et infestant.  Quod timorem attinet quem illi qui in falsis sunt et infestant habebunt pro Divino, sciendum quod timor sit unicum medium 
quod coercet infernales et tenet illos in vinculis; timor enim est commune vinculum tam illis qui probi sunt quam illis qui mali; sed illis qui probi sunt est timor internus, qui est {1}pro salute, 
ne scilicet {2}pereant quoad animas, et propterea ne contra conscientiam, hoc est, ne contra verum et bonum quae sunt conscientiae aliquid faciant, consequenter est illis timor ne aliquid contra justum 
et aequum, ita ne contra proximum; at timor hic fit timor sanctus quantum conjungitur affectioni charitatis, et magis quantum conjungitur amori in Dominum; timor tunc fit qualis {3} infantum erga 
parentes quos amant; tunc quantum in bono amoris sunt, tantum non apparet timor, at quantum non in bono sunt, tantum apparet et fit anxietas; talis est timor Dei, de quo in Verbo multoties. 	2 At timor 
illis qui mali sunt non est aliquis timor internus, nempe pro salute ac inde conscientiae, nam talem timorem in mundo prorsus rejecerunt tam per vitam quam per principia falsi faventia vitae; sed 
pro timore interno illis est timor externus, ne scilicet depriventur honoribus, ne lucro, ne fama propter illa, ne puniantur secundum leges, ne orbentur vita; pro his est timor illis qui in malo, quando 
in mundo sunt; hi cum in alteram vitam veniunt, quia non coerceri et in vinculis teneri possunt per timorem internum, tenentur per timorem externum, qui illis imprimitur per punitiones; inde timor 
illis malum faciendi {4}; et tandem illis fit timor pro Divino, sed timor externus, ut dictum, qui est absque ulla voluntate desistendi a malo faciendo ex affectione boni, {5}sed ex terrore poenarum, 
quas demum horrent. 	3 Ex his nunc constare potest quod timor sit unicum medium tenendi in vinculis; et quod timor externus, qui est timor punitionum, sit unicum medium coercendi malos; et quod illa 
causa sit cruciatus malorum in inferno; nam mali, (m){6}cum in alteram vitam veniunt, quando illis auferuntur vincula externa quae illis fuerunt in mundo, et relinquuntur suis cupiditatibus, tunc sunt 
sicut ferae, et nihil plus cupiunt quam dominari, et quoscumque qui non favent perdere, hoc jucundissimum vitae eorum (x)est; nam quantum quis semet amat, tantum alios qui non favent odio habet; et quantum 
quisque in odio est, tantum {7}est in jucundo perdendi; sed in mundo hoc occultatur.(n) 	@1 salutis$ 	@2 After animas$ 	@3 i timor$ 	@4 i, nam socii mali nihil potius cupiunt quam punire$ 	@5 
d sed i solum$ 	@6 in altera vita$ 	@7 After jucundo$ </p>
