<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10436节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10436</strong>.“用大能和大力的手”表凭神性能力。这从“大能和大力的手”的含义清楚可知，当论及耶和华时，“大能和大力的手”是指神性能力（参看<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="8050.htm">8050</a>，<a href="8069.htm">8069</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>节）。这些话和此前那些话的含义从内义上的思路清楚看出来，即：尽管以色列民族的兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在事物，以至于他们的心智根本不可能被提升到更内层，但一个教会的代表仍能建立在他们当中，圣言仍能在那里写就，这些事之所以能够实现，是因为凭神性能力通过他们所感兴趣的那些没有任何内在之物的外在事物而与天堂的联系仍是有可能的；因此，一种与他们若同时对内在之物感兴趣将会有的情形相类似的效果是能够实现的。关于这个问题，可参看前面关于该民族的说明（<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>节提到的地方）；通过他们的外在仪式，也就是内在事物的代表，凭主的神性能力而与天堂的联系是存在的（<a href="4311.htm">4311</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="8588.htm">8588</a>，<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>节）。<br />要知道，教会之所以为教会，凭的不是外在敬拜，而是内在敬拜；因为外在敬拜是身体的敬拜，而内在敬拜是灵魂的敬拜。因此，没有内在的外在敬拜不过是身体动作，因而是没有来自神性的生命的敬拜。教会成员通过敬拜的内在事物与天堂相联系，对他们来说，外在形式充当内在事物可以停靠于其上的一个基础或层面，就像一座房子立于其地基之上那样。当一切事物都像一座房子立于地基之上那样停靠时，一切都是完整而牢固的，整个人都被神性掌管。<br />古教会成员就是这个样子。一个代表性教会也是这个样子，因此被主接纳，这从圣言中的大量经文清楚看出来。例如对它的描述就包含在摩西的歌中（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.3.htm">32:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.14.htm">14</a>）。但这样一个教会不可能建在以色列和犹太民族当中，原因如前所述，即：他们的内层是污秽的，因而完全违背天堂良善和信之良善，也就是敬拜的内在事物。因此，当他们如此顽固地坚持他们要进入迦南地，而这相当于代表教会时，主规定，通过他们纯粹的外在代表与天堂的联系当变得可能。因为一切敬拜的目的是与天堂的联系，以及主通过这种联系而与世人的结合。这些就是此处在内义上所论述的事。</p>

With great power and with a strong hand. That this signifies by virtue of Divine power, is evident from the signification of "great power and a strong hand," when said of Jehovah, as being Divine power 
(see n. 7188, 7189, 8050, 8069, 8153). How the case is herein and heretofore, can be seen from the series of things in the internal sense, which is that although the Israelitish nation was in external 
things without what is internal, insomuch that they could not be raised at all toward interior things, still the representative of a church could be instituted among them, and the Word could be written 
there, for the reason that by virtue of the Divine power, there could nevertheless be communication with heaven by external things without what is internal; and thus a similar effect could be produced 
as if they were at the same time in what is internal (on which see what was shown concerning that nation in the places cited above, n. 10396; as that by the external things with them, which were 
representative of interior things, there was communication with heaven by virtue of the Divine power of the Lord, n. 4311, 4444, 6304, 8588, 8788, 8806). [2] Be it known that the church is not the 
church from external worship, but from internal worship; for external worship is of the body, but internal worship is of the soul. Consequently external worship without internal is of the outward act 
only, thus is worship without life from the Divine. Through the interior things of worship the man of the church communicates with the heavens, to which the external serves as a plane upon which the interior 
things may subsist, as a house upon its foundations; and when it so subsists it is complete and firm, and the whole man is directed by the Divine.  [3] Such was the man of the Ancient Church, 
which also was a representative church, and therefore that church was accepted by the Lord, as is evident from many passages in the Word; for example, it is described in the song of Moses (Deut. 32:3-14). 
But such a church could not be instituted among the Israelitish and Jewish nation, for the reason, as before said, that their interiors were filthy, thus were utterly contrary to the good of celestial 
love and the good of faith, which are the interior things of worship. Therefore when they so obstinately insisted that they should come into the land of Canaan, which was the same thing as representing 
the church, it was provided by the Lord that there should nevertheless be communication with heaven by means of their merely external worship; for the end of all worship is communication with 
heaven, and thereby the conjunction of the Lord with man. These are the things here treated of in the internal sense. </p>

'With great power and with a strong hand' means by Divine Power. This is clear from the meaning of 'great power and a strong hand', when it has reference to Jehovah, as Divine Power, dealt with in <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="8050.htm">8050</a>, <a href="8069.htm">8069</a>, <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>. What these words and those before them imply becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal sense, which is that although the Israelite nation's interest lay in external 
things and not in what was internal, to such an extent that their minds could not be raised at all to more internal levels, what was representative of the Church could nevertheless be established 
among them and the Word could be written there. These things could be achieved because by the Divine Power contact with heaven by means of those external things in which they were interested without 
anything internal was nevertheless possible, and so a situation could be effected similar to that which would have existed if they had been interested at the same time in what was internal. On this 
matter, see what has been shown regarding that nation in the places referred to above in <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>, such as those which show that through the external observances among them, which were representative of 
inner realities, there was by the Lord's Divine Power contact with heaven, <a href="4311.htm">4311</a>, <a href="4444.htm">4444</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>, <a href="8588.htm">8588</a>, <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>, <a href="8806.htm">8806</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be remembered that the Church is not the Church by virtue of its outward 
worship but of its inward worship; for outward worship is that of the body whereas inward is that of the soul. Consequently outward worship without the inward is no more than movements of the body, 
thus worship without life from the Divine. Through the inner components of worship a member of the Church is in contact with the heavens, for whom the outward form serves as the basis on which the inner 
components may rest like a house on its foundations. And when everything rests like a house on its foundations all is complete and firm, and the whole person is governed by the Divine.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This 
is what a member of the Ancient Church had been like. This too had been a representative Church and for this reason had been accepted by the Lord, as is clear from a large number of places in the Word. 
A description of it is contained in the Song of Moses, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:3-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:3-15</a>. But such a Church could not be established among the Israelite and Jewish nation, for the reason given above, that inwardly they 
were foul, and so were altogether contrary to the good of heavenly love and the good of faith, which are the inner components of worship. Therefore, when they insisted so stubbornly that they should 
enter the land of Canaan, which was tantamount to representing the Church, the Lord saw to it that contact with heaven through their merely outward worship should nevertheless be made possible. For the 
purpose of all worship is contact with heaven, and through this the Lord's being joined to man. These are the matters which the internal sense is dealing with at present.  </p>

`Virtute magna et manu forti': quod significet ex Divina Potentia, constat ex significatione `virtutis magnae et manus fortis' cum de Jehovah, quod sit Divina Potentia, de qua n. 7188, 7189, 8050, 8069, 
8153. Quomodo cum his et illis se habet, ex serie rerum in sensu interno constare potest, {1}quae est quod tametsi gens Israelitica in externis absque interno esset, adeo ut prorsus non elevari versus 
interiora posset, usque apud illos institui Ecclesiae repraesentativum {2}posset, et ibi conscribi Verbum; ex causa quia ex Divina Potentia usque ab externis absque interno communicatio dari posset 
cum caelo, et sic simile effici ac si simul in {3}interno essent; de qua re videantur quae de gente illa in locis citatis supra n. 10,396 ostensa sunt; ut quod per externa apud illos, quae erant repraesentativa 
interiorum, communicatio fuerit cum caelo, ex Divina Domini Potentia, n. 4311, 4444, 6304, 8588, 8788, 8806. 	[2] Sciendum est quod Ecclesia non sit Ecclesia a cultu externo: sed a cultu 
interno, cultus enim externus est corporis, at internus est animae; inde cultus externus absque interno est modo gestus {4}, ita cultus absque vita a Divino; homo Ecclesiae per interiora cultus communicat 
cum caelis, quibus {5}externum inservit pro plano super {6}quo interiora {7}subsistunt sicut domus super suo fundamento; et cum ita {8}subsistit, completum est, et firmum, ac totus homo a Divino 
regitur. 	[3] Talis fuerat homo Ecclesiae antiquae, quae etiam Ecclesia repraesentativa fuit, quapropter illa Ecclesia accepta fuit Domino, ut constat a pluribus locis in Verbo, describitur in Cantico 
Moschis, Deut. xxxii 3-15; sed talis Ecclesia apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam institui non potuit, ex causa, de qua supra, quod interiora eorum essent foeda, ita prorsus contra bonum amoris 
caelestis et bonum fidei, quae sunt interiora cultus; ideo, cum tam contumaciter institerunt, quod illi venirent in terram Canaan, quod idem erat cum repraesentare Ecclesiam, provisum est a Domino quod 
usque per cultum eorum mere externum communicatio cum caelo daretur, nam finis omnis cultus est communicatio cum caelo, ac per id conjunctio Domini cum homine. Haec sunt de quibus nunc in sensu interno
