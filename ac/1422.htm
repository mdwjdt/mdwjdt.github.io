<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1422.</strong>“祝福你的，我必赐福与他们”表那些发自内心承认主之人的一切幸福。这从“赐福”的含义清楚可知，“赐福”包含从主接受的每一个事物，既有良善之物，也有真理之物，因而包括属天、属灵、属世、世俗和肉体之物。因为就普遍意义而言，“赐福”包含所有这些，从“赐福”所在的语境可以看出它在各个地方的含义，因为它适合那时它所论及的事物。由此明显可知，“祝福你的，我必赐福与他们”表那些发自内心承认主之人的一切幸福；因为如前所述，此处在内义上论述的是主。<br />“称颂（Bless）耶和华（或主）”是古人的习惯用语，这清楚可见于圣言，如诗篇：<br />从以色列源头而来的，当在各会中称颂主神。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.26.htm">68:26</a>）<br /><br />要向耶和华歌唱，称颂祂的名，天天传扬祂的救恩。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.2.htm">96:2</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />这奥秘的事就在夜间异象中给但以理显明，但以理便称颂天上的神。但以理说，神的名是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远！因为智慧能力都属乎祂。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.19.htm">2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.20.htm">20</a>）<br />我们还读到，撒迦利亚和西面都称颂神（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.64.htm">1:64</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.28.htm">2:28</a>）。显然，“称颂主”就是向祂歌唱，传扬祂的救恩，传讲祂的智慧能力，因而发自内心承认和认识主。凡这样做的人必被主赐福，即被赐予那些属赐福的事物，即属天、属灵、属世、世俗和肉体的好处，当这些好处依次不间断地流入时，幸福就存在于它们里面。<br />由于“称颂耶和华（或主）”和“被耶和华（或主）赐福”是习惯用语，故人们也常说“耶和华是应当称颂的”。如诗篇：<br />耶和华是应当称颂的，因为祂听了我恳求的声音。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗28.6.htm">28:6</a>）<br /><br />耶和华是应当称颂的！因为祂向我施展奇妙的慈爱。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗31.21.htm">31:21</a>）<br /><br />神是应当称颂的！祂并没有推却我的祷告，也没有叫祂的慈爱离开我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗66.20.htm">66:20</a>）<br /><br />独行奇事的耶和华以色列的神，是应当称颂的。祂荣耀的名也当称颂，直到永远。愿祂的荣耀充满全地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.18.htm">72:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.19.htm">19</a>）<br /><br />耶和华啊，你是应当称颂的！求你将你的律例教训我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.12.htm">119:12</a>）<br /><br />耶和华我的磐石是应当称颂的，他教导我的手。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.1.htm">144:1</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />撒迦利亚被圣灵充满了，就预言说，以色列的神是应当称颂的。因祂眷顾祂的百姓，为他们施行救赎。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.67.htm">1:67</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.68.htm">68</a>）</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1422.</strong> I will bless those who bless you means that all happiness belongs to those who acknowledge the Lord in their hearts. This can be seen from the symbolism of a blessing as involving absolutely all gifts from the Lord, both those that are good and those that are true, and accordingly heavenly, spiritual, earthly, worldly, and personal benefits. And because a blessing in a comprehensive sense encompasses all those gifts, you can see what it symbolizes in each instance from the story line [at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_3" target=_top>Genesis 12:3</a>], since the symbolism depends on context. It stands to reason, then, that "I will bless those who bless you" means that all happiness belongs to those who acknowledge the Lord in their hearts, since in an inner sense the discussion here centers on the Lord, as noted [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1401" target=_top>1401-1402</a>].<br />[2] Among the ancients, blessing Jehovah (the Lord) was a customary way of speaking, as the Word reveals. In David, for example:<br />In your assemblies, bless God; [bless] the Lord from the fountain of Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_68_26" target=_top>Psalms 68:26</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Sing to Jehovah; bless his name! Spread the good news of his salvation from day to day! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_96_2" target=_top>Psalms 96:2</a>)<br />In Daniel:<br />In a vision at night, the secret was revealed. So Daniel blessed the God of the heavens and said, "A blessing on the name of God himself from age to age, because wisdom and might are his." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_19-20" target=_top>Daniel 2:19-20</a>)<br />We also read of Zechariah and Simeon that they blessed God (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_luke_1_64" target=_top>Luke 1:64</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_luke_2_28" target=_top>2:28</a>). In these passages it is clear what blessing the Lord is: singing to him, spreading the good news of his salvation, proclaiming his wisdom and might, and so confessing and acknowledging the Lord with all our heart. People who do this cannot help being blessed by the Lord; that is, they cannot help receiving gifts that are blessings, or in other words, heavenly, spiritual, earthly, worldly, and personal good. These things are good, and produce happiness, when they come in this order.<br />[3] As it was common for people to speak in terms of blessing Jehovah (the Lord) or being blessed by him, it was also a common turn of speech to say, "A blessing on Jehovah." In David, for instance:<br />A blessing on Jehovah, because he has heard the voice of my prayers. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_28_6" target=_top>Psalms 28:6</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />A blessing on Jehovah, because he has made his mercy to me extraordinary. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_31_21" target=_top>Psalms 31:21</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />A blessing on God, who has not cast my prayers aside or cast his mercy away from me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_66_20" target=_top>Psalms 66:20</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />A blessing on Jehovah God, the God of Israel, working miracles alone. And a blessing on his glorious name forever; and with his glory all the earth will be filled. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_18-19" target=_top>Psalms 72:18-19</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />A blessing on you, Jehovah; teach me your statutes. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_12" target=_top>Psalms 119:12</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />A blessing on Jehovah, my rock, teaching my hands. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_psalms_144_1" target=_top>Psalms 144:1</a>)<br />In Luke:<br />Zechariah, filled with the holy spirit, prophesied, saying, "A blessing on the God of Israel, because he has visited his people and secured their deliverance." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1422/bible_king-james-version_luke_1_67-68" target=_top>Luke 1:67-68</a>) </p>

I will bless them that bless thee. That this signifies all happiness to those who acknowledge the Lord from the heart, is evident from the signification of a "blessing," as involving all and each of 
the things that are from the Lord, as well those that are good as those that are true; thus celestial, spiritual, natural, worldly, and corporeal things; and because in the universal sense "blessing" 
embraces all these, it may be seen in each passage, from the connection, what is signified by "to bless;" for this adapts itself to the things of which it is predicated. From this it is evident that "I 
will bless them that bless thee," signifies all happiness to those who acknowledge the Lord from the heart; for in the internal sense, as already said, the Lord is here treated of.  [2] Among the ancients, 
"to bless Jehovah," or "the Lord," was a customary form of speech, as is evident from the Word. Thus in David: </p>
<p>     Bless ye God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountain of Israel (Ps. 
68:26). Again: </p>
<p>     Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, proclaim His salvation from day to day (Ps. 96:2). In Daniel: </p>
<p>     Then was the secret revealed in a vision of the night; therefore Daniel blessed 
the God of the heavens; he said, Blessed be the name of God Himself for ever and ever, for wisdom and power are His (Dan. 2:19-20). Of Zacharias and Simeon we also read that they "blessed God" 
(Luke 1:64, 2:28). Here it is evident that "to bless the Lord" is to sing to Him, to proclaim the good tidings of His salvation, to preach His wisdom and power, and thus to confess and acknowledge the 
Lord from the heart. They who do this cannot but be blessed by the Lord, that is, be gifted with those things which belong to blessing, namely, with celestial, spiritual, natural, worldly, and corporeal 
good; these, when they follow each other in this order, are the goods in which there is happiness.  [3] As "to bless Jehovah," or "the Lord," and "to be blessed by Jehovah," or "the Lord," was a 
common form of speech, it was therefore common also to say "Blessed be Jehovah." As in David: </p>
<p>     Blessed be Jehovah, because He hath heard the voice of my supplications (Ps. 28:6). Again: </p>
<p>     Blessed 
be Jehovah, for He hath made His mercy wonderful to me (Ps. 31:21). Again: </p>
<p>     Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayers, nor His mercy from me (Ps. 66:20). Again: </p>
<p>     Blessed be 
Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things and blessed be His glorious name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled with His glory (Ps. 72:18-19). Again: </p>
<p>     Blessed art Thou, 
O Jehovah teach me Thy statutes (Ps. 119:12). Again: </p>
<p>     Blessed be Jehovah, my Rock, that teacheth my hands (Ps. 144:1). In Luke: </p>
<p>     Zacharias, filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, saying, 
Blessed be the God of Israel, for He hath visited and wrought deliverance for His people (Luke 1:67-68). </p>

That 'I will bless those who bless you' means pure happiness to those who from their hearts acknowledge the Lord becomes clear from the meaning of 'blessing', which includes every single thing received 
from the Lord, both that which is good and that which is true, thus every celestial, spiritual, natural, worldly, or bodily form of what is good and true. And because in the universal sense 'blessing' 
embraces all of these, the meaning of 'to bless' in individual places may be seen from the context in which it occurs, for it fits in with those matters to which it then refers. From this it is clear 
that 'I will bless those who bless you' means pure happiness to those who from their hearts acknowledge the Lord, since here in the internal sense, as has been stated, the Lord is the subject. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
'Blessing Jehovah (or the Lord)' was an expression used commonly among the ancients, as is clear in the Word, for example in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Bless God in the assemblies, even the Lord from the fountain 
of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, proclaim His salvation from day to day <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2096:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 96:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
In the vision of the night the arcanum was revealed. 
Therefore Daniel blessed the God of heaven; he said, Let the name of God Himself be blessed for ever and ever, for wisdom and power are His. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And one also reads of Zechariah and Simeon 
blessing God, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:64;%202:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:64; 2:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
Here it is evident what 'blessing the Lord' implies, namely singing to Him, proclaiming His salvation, declaring His wisdom and power, and so confessing and acknowledging 
Him from the heart. People who do so are most certainly blessed by the Lord, that is, they are gifted with those things which constitute blessing, namely celestial good, spiritual good, natural good, 
worldly good, and bodily good, and when these forms of good flow consecutively in this order happiness exists within them. </p>
<p></p>

 Since 'blessing Jehovah (or the Lord)' and 'being blessed by Jehovah 
(or the Lord)' were expressions used commonly among the ancients it was therefore also common to say 'Blessed be Jehovah', as in David, </p>

'Benedicam benedicentibus tibi':  quod significet omnem felicitatem illis qui ex corde agnoscunt Dominum, constare potest a significatione 'benedictionis' quod involvat omnia et singula quae a Domino, 
tam quae bona sunt quam quae vera, ita caelestia, spiritualia, naturalia, mundana et corporea; et quia benedictio complectitur universali sensu omnia illa, constare potest in singulis locis ex serie 
quid 'benedicere' significat, nam se habet applicate ad illa de quibus praedicatur; constat inde quod 'benedicam benedicentibus tibi' significet omnem felicitatem illis qui ex corde agnoscunt Dominum; 
[2] nam hic in sensu interno, ut dictum, agitur de Domino; 'benedicere Jehovae seu Domino' fuit apud antiquos formula sollemnis, sicut constare potest in Verbo, ut apud Davidem, In congregationibus 
benedicite Deo, Domino ex fonte Israelis, Ps. 1xviii 27 [A.V. 26]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Cantate Jehovae, benedicite Nomini Ipsius, evangelizate de die in diem salutem Ipsius, Ps. xcvi 2: </p>
<p>apud Danielem, In 
visione noctis arcanum revelatum est, ideo Daniel benedixit Deo caelorum, dixit, Esto Nomen Ipsius Dei benedictum a saeculo usque in saeculum, quia sapientia et potentia Ipsi, ii 19, 20: </p>
<p>de Zacharia 
et Simeone etiam legitur quod benedixerint Deo, Luc. i 64; ii 28; patet hic quid 'benedicere Domino,' nempe cantare Ipsi, evangelizare salutem Ipsius, praedicare sapientiam et potentiam Ipsius, ita 
confiteri et agnoscere Dominum ex corde; qui hoc faciunt, non possunt non benedici a Domino, hoc est, donari illis quae sunt benedictionis, nempe bono caelesti, spirituali, naturali, mundano et corporeo, 
quae bona sunt, ubi ita sibi succedunt, in quibus felicitas.  [3] Quia formula communis fuit 'Benedicere Jehovae seu Domino,' et 'Benedici a Jehovah seu Domino,' ideo quoque formula communis fuit, 
dicere 'Benedictus Jehovah,' ut apud Davidem, Benedictus Jehovah, quia audivit vocem precum mearum, Ps. xxviii 6: </p>
