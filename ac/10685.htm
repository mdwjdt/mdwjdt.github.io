<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10685节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10685</strong>.“摩西在耶和华那里四十昼又四十夜”表在教会、敬拜和圣言在一个内在层面上存在之前的试探。这从“四十昼又四十夜”的含义清楚可知，当论及与人同在的教会时，“四十昼又四十夜”是指试探的状态（参看<a href="730.htm">730</a>，<a href="862.htm">862</a>，<a href="2272.htm">2272</a>，<a href="2273.htm">2273</a>，<a href="8098.htm">8098</a>节）。之所以表示在教会、敬拜和圣言在一个内在层面上存在之前，是因为试探是手段，被称为内在人的一个人里面的内在层面通过它们向这个人打开并被移交给他。因此，凡正在重生的人都会经历试探。内在层面之所以通过试探被打开并得以存在，是因为当一个人卷入试探，也就是与邪恶和虚假的争战时，主从里面流入并代表这个人争战。人可从以下事实认识到这一点：在卷入试探的时候，他会从内心进行抵抗；因为他若不从内心进行抵抗，就不会得胜，而是会屈服、倒下。在试探期间，他没有意识到这种内心的抵抗，因为当卷入试探时，他由于攻击他的邪恶和虚假而处在模糊、黑暗之中；但试探之后，那些具有对真理的感知之人就意识到了。事实上，当一个人活在世上时，他不知道被主引入他的内在的事物，因为那时，在进入来世之前，他在外在人或属世人里面思考，而不是在内在人里面感知。然而，当在试探中得胜时，他就应该知道并承认，在争战的不是他自己，而是代表他的主。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10685</b></p><p><b>10685.</b>
And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights. That this signifies temptations before there is any internal of the church, of worship, and of the Word, is evident from the signification of 
"forty days and forty nights," when said of the church with man, as being states of temptation (see n. 730, 862, 2272, 2273, 8098). That it signifies before there is any internal of the church, of worship, 
and of the Word, is because the internal which is called the internal man is opened and given to man by means of temptations. Hence it is that everyone who is being regenerated undergoes temptations. 
The reason why the internal is opened and given by means of temptations, is that when a man is in temptations (which are combats against evils and falsities), the Lord flows in from within, and 
fights for him; as the man may know from the fact that when he is in temptations he resists inwardly, for unless he resisted inwardly he would not conquer, but would yield. This interior resistance 
does not come to the notice of the man at the time, because when he is in temptations he is in obscurity, from the evil and from the falsities of evil which are assailing him; but after the temptations, 
it is noticed by those who are in the perception of truth. For the things which are introduced by the Lord into the internal of man are unknown to him while he lives in the world, because at that time 
he thinks in the external or natural man, and not perceptibly in the internal man until he comes into the other life. Nevertheless when he has overcome in temptations he ought to know and acknowledge 
that he himself has not fought, but the Lord for him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10685</b></p><p><b>10685.</b>
'And he was with Jehovah forty days and forty nights' means temptations before the Church, worship, and the Word exist on an internal level. This is clear from the meaning of 'forty days and nights', 
when it has reference to the Church with a person, as states involving temptation, dealt with in <a href="730.htm">730</a>, <a href="862.htm">862</a>, <a href="2272.htm">2272</a>, <a href="2273.htm">2273</a>, <a href="8098.htm">8098</a>. Before the Church, worship, and the Word exist on an internal level is meant 
because temptations are the means by which the internal level in a person, called the internal man, is opened up to that person and handed over to him. Consequently everyone who is being regenerated 
undergoes temptations. The reason why temptations are the means by which the internal level is opened up and brought into existence is that while a person is embroiled in temptations, which are conflicts 
against evils and falsities, the Lord flows in from the interior and fights on the person's behalf. This may be recognized by a person from the fact that at the times when he is embroiled in temptations 
he inwardly offers resistance; for unless he did so he would not be victorious but would go under. He is not conscious of that inward resistance during temptations, because while embroiled in 
them he is in the dark, on account of the evil and falsities of evil that assail him; but after temptations those with a perception of truth are conscious of it. For while a person is living in the world 
he has no knowledge of the things which the Lord introduces into him on an internal level, because at that time, before he enters the next life, he thinks on the level of the external or natural 
man, and not perceptibly on an internal level. Nevertheless he ought to know and acknowledge, when victorious in temptations, that all the fighting was done not by himself but by the Lord on his behalf.  </p>

`Et fuit cum Jehovah (x)quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes' quod significet tentationes antequam internum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi datur, constat ex significatione `quadraginta dierum et noctium' 
cum de Ecclesia apud hominem, quod sint status tentationis, de qua n. 730, 862, 2272, 2273, 8098; quod {1}sit antequam internum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi datur, est quia internum, quod vocatur 
internus homo, aperitur et datur homini per tentationes; inde est quod omnis qui regeneratur tentationes (x)subeat; quod internum per tentationes aperiatur et detur, est quia cum homo in tentationibus 
est, quae sunt pugnae contra mala et falsa, Dominus ab interiore influit et pugnat pro illo; quod etiam homo {2}scire potest ex eo quod cum in tentationibus est, interius resistat, nam nisi (t)interius 
resisteret, non vinceret sed succumberet; interior illa resistentia tunc non venit ad apperceptionem hominis, quia cum in tentationibus est, in obscuro est ex malo et ex falsis mali quae impugnant; 
at post tentationes, apud illos qui in perceptione {3}veri sunt, nam quae inferuntur a Domino in internum hominis, non scit homo (d)cum in mundo vivit, quoniam tunc {4}in externo seu naturali {5}homine 
cogitat, et non perceptibiliter {4}in interno, priusquam in alteram vitam venit; sed usque {6}scire et agnoscere debet cum vicit in tentationibus, quod non ipse pugnaverit, sed Dominus pro ipso. {7} @1 
sint$ @2 qui in tentationibus est, scire potest ex eo, quod$ @3 boni$ @4 ab$ @5 suo$ @6 sciet$ @7 A continues as follows, though the second half is crossed off (i.e. from et tunc omnia in 
ordinem...):  sciendum est, quod internum hominis aperiatur cum in tentationibus est, ac ei detur post tentationes, per dari internum intelligitur implantatio boni ibi; apud hominem enim in ipsis tentationibus 
excitantur ver boni, quae ei a Domino, et falsa mali, quae ei ab inferno inde, quare tunc ei confusum, inordinatum, et squallidum, at post tentationes fit ei serenum et clarum, et tunc omnia 
in ordinem rediguntur a Domino, mala et falsa mali removentur; ac bona et vera boni loco eorum implantantur; haec omnia fiunt homine nesciente; ex causa, de qua supra, quod homo id nesciat, intelligitur 
per haec Domini verba apud Johannem, Spiritus ubi vult, spirat, et vocem ejus audis, atqui non scis, unde venit, aut quo abit; sic est omnis qui generatus est a spiritu, iii 8:  et apud Marcum, Ita 
se habet Regnum Dei, quemadmodum cum homo projicit semen super terram, dormit dein, et surgit noctu et die, semen vero germinat et crescit, dum nescit ipse, iv 26, 27; regnum Dei, est Ecclesia apud 
hominem, et quia est Ecclesia, est quoque coelum.  cp with the next number.$ </p>
