<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>995.</strong>“都可以作你们的食物”表人们将要享受的附带的快乐。这从以下事实清楚可知：乐趣不仅振奋一个人的情感，还能象食物一样支撑他。没有快乐的乐趣并非乐趣，而是某种无生命之物。乐趣之所以是乐趣，并被称为乐趣，正是由于快乐。然而，快乐的性质决定了乐趣的性质。肉体和感官之物本身完全是物质的，无生命和死的。但它们从源自有序排列的内在事物的快乐那里接受生命。由此清楚可知，内在事物的生命之性质决定了乐趣中所固有的快乐之性质，因为这快乐中有生命。唯独含有主之良善的快乐具有生命，因为这种情况下，它通过良善本身的生命而具有生命。故此处经上说“一切活着的爬物，都可以作你们的食物”，即作为享受。<br />有些人认为，人若想在来生获得幸福，就绝不可沉浸在肉体和感官乐趣中，而应弃绝所有此类事物。他们声称，这类肉体和世俗的追求会妨碍人，使人远离属灵和天堂的生活。但是，凡有这种想法，并在肉身生活时自愿过悲惨生活的人，都对事情的真相一无所知。没人被禁止享受肉体和感官乐趣，即占有土地和财富的乐趣；荣誉地位和为国家服务的乐趣；婚姻之爱和舔犊之爱的乐趣；友谊和交际的乐趣；听觉或悦耳音乐和歌声的乐趣；视觉或多样化的美丽事物的乐趣，诸如好看的衣服，漂亮的居所及其家具，美丽的花园及类似事物，它们因形式和谐和色彩而令人快乐；嗅觉或芳香气味的乐趣；味觉或营养美味的食物和饮料的乐趣；触觉的乐趣。事实上，如前所述，所有这些都是由内在情感所产生的最外在或肉体情感。<br />活的内在情感全都从善与真那里获得其快乐，而善与真则从仁与信那里获得其快乐，仁与信从主，因而从生命本身那里获得其快乐，这就是为何情感及由此而来的乐趣是活的原因。由于真正的乐趣有这样的源头，所以人不可拒绝它们。事实上，当它们出于该源头时，其快乐无限超越非出于该源头的快乐，后者的快乐相对来说是污秽的。以婚姻之爱的乐趣为例，当这爱的乐趣源于婚姻真爱时，它无限超越非出于此源头的乐趣，以致处在婚姻真爱中的人就处在诸如天堂般的快乐幸福中，因为它是从天堂降下的。凡属上古教会者皆承认这一点。而奸淫者在淫行中所获得的快乐对这些人来说如此可憎，以致他们一想到它就充满恐惧。这清楚表明凡不从生命的真正源泉，即主那里降下的快乐是何性质。<br />人永远不可拒绝上述乐趣，它们非但不可被拒绝，反而在出自其真正的源头时，会第一次成为真实的乐趣。这一点从以下事实也可清楚看出来：很多在世时拥有权力、地位和财富，并享受丰富的肉体和感官乐趣的人，如今就在天堂被祝福和幸福者之列。对他们而言，如今内在快乐和幸福是活的，因为它们的源头在于仁之善和对主的信之真。由于这些幸福快乐起源于仁爱和对主的信仰，所以他们从作为其目的的用的角度来看待这些东西。用本身才是最令他们快乐的，其乐趣中所固有的快乐由此而来（参看<a href="945.htm">945</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]995.</strong> The symbolism of will serve you for food as the joy that people would have in this pleasure can be seen from the fact that each of our pleasures not only touches us but also nourishes us the way food does.<br />A pleasure that is not enjoyable is not pleasure but some lifeless thing. Joy is what makes it pleasurable in name and in fact. But the nature of the joy involved determines the quality of the pleasure. In themselves, personal and sensory rewards are only material things, lifeless and dead. From delight, however, which emerges from progressively deeper sources inside us, they receive life. Plainly, then, the quality of the life we have in our deeper dimensions determines the nature of the enjoyment in our pleasures, because enjoyment has life in it. Delight that contains something good from the Lord is the only thing that is alive, because in that case it flows from the genuine life within goodness. That is why the verse says, "Every creeping thing that is alive will serve you for food," that is, for enjoyment.<br />[2] Some believe that no one who wants to be happy in the other world should ever live among personal or sensual pleasures but should renounce them all. They assert that these are bodily and worldly distractions that hinder us from living a spiritual and heavenly life. But people who think this way and willingly subject themselves to misery while living in the world are misinformed as to the true situation.<br />No one is ever forbidden to enjoy personal and sensory pleasures, which are these: pleasure in owning property and having other wealth; the pleasure of rank and high office in government; pleasure connected with love in marriage and with love for babies and children; pleasure in friendship and social contact; auditory pleasure, or pleasure in the sweetness of song and music; visual pleasure, or pleasure in the many kinds of beauty that exist, such as elegant clothes, fine mansions with all their furnishings, beautiful gardens, and similar objects whose symmetry makes them delightful; olfactory pleasure, or pleasure in sweet scents; gustatory pleasure, or pleasure in the wonderful flavor and useful qualities of food and drink; and tactile pleasures.<br />These are, after all, our most outward emotional responses — physical responses — rising out of inward responses, as noted.<br />[3] Inward responses, which are alive, all derive their appeal from goodness and truth, and goodness and truth derive theirs from charity and faith and beyond that from the Lord, so that they derive it from life itself. As a result, emotional responses and the lower pleasures that come from them are alive. And since true pleasure springs from this source, it is never denied to anyone. In fact when it springs from there, the thrill it offers outstrips by far any thrill that does not originate there. The other kind of delight is dirty by comparison.<br />Take for example the sensual pleasures connected with love in marriage. When those pleasures rise out of true marriage love, they surpass immeasurably any pleasure that does not. So superior are they that people who have true marriage love are virtually in the blissful elation of heaven, since it comes down to them from heaven. The people who belonged to the earliest church testify to this. The delight an adulterer feels in adultery was so loathsome to them that merely thinking about it made their hair stand on end.{*1} From this we can draw conclusions about the nature of any pleasure that does not flow from the true fountain of life: the Lord.<br />[4] Again, the pleasures mentioned above are never denied to us. So far are they from being denied to us that they do not even begin to feel good until we obtain them from their true origin. Further corroboration for this fact is the consideration that many people who enjoyed power, importance, and wealth during their earthly lives and abundant gratifications of all kinds, both personal and sensory, are among the blessed and happy in heaven. Deeper joys and a deeper happiness are now alive in them, because these feelings originated in the good impulses of neighborly love and in the true ideas constituting faith in the Lord. Because the joy and happiness originated in charity and in faith in the Lord, such people viewed all their lower pleasures in terms of usefulness, since usefulness was their goal. The usefulness itself was intensely exhilarating to them and was what made their lower pleasures enjoyable. See the lesson of experience in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_995/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_945" target=_top>945</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's view that sexual pleasure as an expression of love in marriage is holy and presages the delights of heaven is laid out fully in his work Marriage Love (1768). This understanding contrasts with the view, widespread in Christianity from ancient times, that sexuality is morally questionable even in marriage. The church father Jerome (around 347-around 420) famously wrote, "‘He who too ardently loves his wife is an adulterer.' It is disgraceful to love another man's wife at all, or one's own too much" (Jerome Against Jovinianus 1:49 [Jerome 1996, 386]; the first sentence is Jerome's quotation from the Sentences of an obscure ancient writer, Xystus or Sextus, on whom see The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., under "Sextus 2. "). [RS] </p>

Shall be food for you. That this signifies its delight which they should enjoy, is evident from this, that any pleasure not only affects man, but also sustains him, like food. Pleasure without delight 
is not pleasure, but is something without life, and only from delight is and is called pleasure. Such also as is the delight, such is the pleasure. Corporeal and sensuous things are in themselves only 
material, lifeless, and dead; but from delights which come in order from the interiors, they have life. From this it is evident that such as is the life of the interiors, such is the delight in the 
pleasures, for in the delight there is life. The delight in which there is good from the Lord is alone living, for it is then from the very life of good; for which reason it is here said, "every creeping 
thing that liveth shall be food for you" that is, for enjoyment.  [2] Some think that no one ought ever to live in the pleasures of the body and its senses who wishes to be happy in the other life, 
but that all these should be renounced on the ground that they are corporeal and worldly, withdrawing man and keeping him away from spiritual and heavenly life. But those who think so and therefore 
reduce themselves to voluntary misery while they live in the world, are not well-informed as to what the real case is. No one is forbidden to enjoy the pleasures of the body and its senses, that is, 
the pleasures of possession of lands and wealth; the pleasures of honor and office in the state; the pleasures of conjugial love and of love for infants and children; the pleasures of friendship and 
of interaction with companions; the pleasures of hearing, or of the sweetness of singing and music; the pleasures of sight, or of beauties, which are manifold, as those of becoming dress, of elegant dwellings 
with their furniture, beautiful gardens, and the like, which are delightful from harmony of form and color; the pleasures of smell, or of fragrant odors; the pleasures of taste, or of the flavors 
and benefits of food and drink; the pleasures of touch. For these are most external or bodily affections arising from interior affections, as already said.  [3] Interior affections, which are living, 
all derive their delight from good and truth; and good and truth derive their delight from charity and faith, and in this case do so from the Lord, thus from life itself; wherefore the affections 
and pleasures therefrom are living. And since genuine pleasures have this origin, they are denied to no one. Indeed, when they are from this origin their delight indefinitely surpasses delight not from 
this source, which is in comparison unclean. For example, the pleasure of conjugial love, when it has its origin from true conjugial love, surpasses immeasurably pleasure that has not this origin, 
so much so that those who are in true conjugial love are in heavenly delight and happiness, since it comes down from heaven. This was acknowledged by the men of the Most Ancient Church. The delight from 
adulteries felt by adulterers was to those men so abominable that when they thought of it they shuddered. From all this it is evident what is the nature of the delight that does not flow from the 
true fountain of life, or from the Lord.  [4] That the pleasures above mentioned are never denied to man, and that so far from being denied they are then first really pleasures when they come from their 
true origin, may also be seen from the fact that very many who have lived in power, dignity, and opulence in the world, and who had all pleasures in abundance, both of the body and of the senses, 
are among the blessed and happy in heaven, and with them now the interior delights and happinesses are living, because they have had their origin in the goods of charity and the truths that are of faith 
in the Lord. And since they had regarded all their pleasures as coming from charity and faith in the Lord, they regarded them from use, which was their end. Use itself was the most delightful thing 
to them, and from this came the delight of their pleasures. (See what has been related from experience, n. 945.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 995</b></p><p><b>995.</b>
'Will be food for you' means the accompanying delight which people were to enjoy. This becomes clear from the fact that any pleasure not only stirs a person's emotion but also sustains him, like food. 
Pleasure without delight is not pleasure but something lifeless. It is from the delight that a pleasure has its being and gets its name. The nature of the delight however determines that of the pleasure. 
In themselves things of the body and of the senses are wholly material, lifeless and dead; but from the delights that spring from interior things ranged in order they receive life. From this it 
is clear that the nature of the life of interior things determines the nature of the delight inherent in pleasures, for delight has life within it. No other kind of delight has life except that which 
contains good from the Lord, for in that case it does so from the life of good itself. Hence the wording here - 'every creeping thing that is living will be food for you', that is, will be an enjoyment. 
Some people are of the opinion that anyone who wishes to be happy in the next life ought never to indulge in bodily and sensory pleasures, but ought to renounce all such things. They say that such 
bodily and worldly pursuits are what deter and withhold men from spiritual and heavenly life. But people who think in this way and who willingly reduce themselves during their lifetime to a miserable 
standard of living are ill-informed of the truth of the matter. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nobody is in any way forbidden to enjoy bodily and sensory pleasures, namely the pleasures of possessing land and wealth; the pleasures 
of positions of honour and of service to the state; the pleasures of conjugial love, and of love of infants and children; the pleasures of friendship and of social intercourse; the pleasures of 
the ear - the sweet sounds of music and song; the pleasures of seeing - things of beauty, which are manifold, such as nice clothes, attractive homes together with their furniture, beautiful gardens, 
and things of a like nature which as they blend together give delight; pleasures of smell - the pleasant odours; pleasures of taste - all the delicious and nourishing qualities of food and drink; and 
the pleasures of touch. Indeed, as stated, all of these are most external or bodily affections having their origin in interior affections.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Interior affections, which are living, all derive their 
delight from good and truth, while good and truth derive theirs from charity and faith, and these in turn do so from the Lord, and so from Life itself. This is why affections and pleasures from this 
source are living. And because that is where genuine pleasures have their origins they are in no way denied to anybody. Indeed when this is their source, the delight that accompanies them is immeasurably 
greater than delight that is not from that source. The latter delight in comparison is filthy. Take for example the pleasure that goes with conjugial love; when its origins lie in truly conjugial 
love it is immeasurably greater than the pleasure that is not from that source - indeed, so much greater that people who dwell in truly conjugial love dwell in delight and happiness such as is heavenly, 
since it comes down from heaven. People also who belonged to the Most Ancient Church declared the same. The delight which adulterers gain from acts of adultery was to those people so detestable that 
even the thought of it filled them with horror. This makes clear the nature of any delight that does not come down from the true fount of life, which is the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That the pleasures mentioned 
above are in no way denied anyone - indeed, far from being denied they are for the first time pleasures when they flow from their true origin - is also made clear by the fact that very many people 
who during their lifetime had power, position, and wealth, and enjoyed in abundance all pleasures of the body and the senses, are now in heaven among the blessed and happy. And with them now interior 
delights and happiness are living because they have had their origin in goods that stem from charity and in truths of faith in the Lord. And since these have originated in charity and faith in the Lord, 
they have looked upon all their pleasures from the point of view of use, which has been their end in view. To them the use itself has been exceedingly delightful, and from this has come the delight 
inherent in their pleasures. See what has been stated from experience in <a href="945.htm">945</a>.  </p>

'Vobis erit in cibum': quod significet jucundum ejus quo fruerentur, constare potest ex eo quod unaquaevis voluptas non solum afficiat hominem, sed etiam sustentet sicut cibus.  Voluptas absque jucundo 
non est voluptas, sed est inanimatum quoddam; ex jucundo trahit quod sit et audiat voluptas; at quale jucundum, talis voluptas; corporea et sensualia sunt in se non nisi quam materialia, inanimata
