<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7988节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7988.</strong>“耶和华的所有军队都从埃及地出来了”表那些处于真理和良善，并仍滞留在那里的人都被带出来了。这从“从埃及地出来”和“耶和华的军队”的含义清楚可知：“从埃及地出来”是指从侵扰当中被带出来并得到释放，“出来”表示被带出来，这是显而易见的，而“埃及地”表示侵扰（参看<a href="7278.htm">7278</a>节）；“耶和华的军队”是指属灵教会的真理和良善，因而是指那些处于真理和良善的人（<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>，<a href="7236.htm">7236</a>节）。真理和良善就是“耶和华的军队（或万军、诸军，万象、军旅等）”，这明显可见于但以理书：<br />有一个小角从这公山羊长出来，向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，并践踏它们。并且它自高自大，甚至高及天象之君。因罪过的缘故，有军旅被交付，它将真理抛在地上。我听见有一位圣者说话，圣所与军旅被践踏要到几时呢？祂对我说，到二千三百个晚上和早晨，圣所就才得纠正。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.9.htm">8:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处很明显，“天象”表示真理和良善；因为经上说它“将些天象和星宿抛落在地”，后来又说“它将真理抛在地上”、“军旅被践踏到二千三百个晚上和早晨”，也就是直到主降临。<br />由于真理和良善是“耶和华的军队（或万军、诸军，万象、军旅等）”，所以在这些经文中，天使被称为祂的“万军（或军队、诸军，万象、军旅等）”：<br />先知米该雅说，我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在祂左右。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上22.19.htm">22:19</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />你们做祂的天使、大有能力，都要称颂耶和华！你们作他的诸军，作祂的仆役，都要称颂耶和华！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗103.20.htm">103:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗103.21.htm">21</a>）<br />天使被称为“万军或诸军”凭的是与他们同在的真理和良善。不仅天使被称为“耶和华的军队（或万军、诸军，万象、军旅等）”，就连天上的光体，如太阳、月亮、星辰也被如此称呼。这是因为“太阳或日头”表示爱之良善，“月亮”表示信之真理，“星辰”表示关于良善与真理的知识或认知。这些光体被称为“万象（或万军、诸军，军队等）”，这一点明显可见于创世记：<br />天和地，以及万象都完成了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.1.htm">2:1</a>）<br />此处“万象”表示天上的一切光体；但就内义而言（此处在内义上描述了人的新造），“万象”表示真理和良善。<br />在诗篇也一样：<br />祂的众使者都要赞美他，祂的诸军都要赞美祂。日头、月亮，你们要赞美祂！放光的星辰，你们都要赞美祂！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.2.htm">148:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“日头”表示爱之良善；“月亮”表示信之真理（参看<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>，<a href="5377.htm">5377</a>，<a href="7083.htm">7083</a>节）；“星辰”表示关于良善和真理的知识或认知（<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节）。<br />“日头、月亮和星辰”之所以表示良善和真理，是因为在天堂，主对属天天使来说是一轮太阳，对属灵天使来说是一轮月亮（<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4300.htm">4300</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="5097.htm">5097</a>，<a href="7078.htm">7078</a>，<a href="7083.htm">7083</a>，<a href="7171.htm">7171</a>，<a href="7173.htm">7173</a>节）；另一个原因是，天使的居所就像星辰一样放光，正如但以理书中的这些话：<br />智慧人必发光，如同穹苍的光辉；那使多人归义的必如星辰，直到永永远远。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.3.htm">12:3</a>）<br />由于天使凭真理和良善被称为“耶和华的军队（或万军、诸军，万象、军旅等）”，太阳、月亮和星辰也是如此；还由于一切真理和良善皆从主发出，故在圣言中，主被称为“万军之耶和华”，也就是“万象或诸军之耶和华”（<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>节）。祂被如此称呼的另外一个原因是，祂代表人与地狱争战。由此可见“耶和华的军队（或万军、诸军，万象、军旅等）”在内义上是什么意思。从埃及出来的雅各的子孙并不是这些军队，他们只是代表他们。这一点从他们在埃及的生活明显看出来，在埃及，他们不知道耶和华，甚至不知道祂的名字，直到摩西从荆棘中间得知祂的名（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.13.htm">3:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.16.htm">16</a>）；还有，他们和埃及人一样，都是崇拜牛犊的，这从出埃及记32章可以推断出来。而且，他们在旷野的生活也表明，他们具有这种品性：他们无法被领进迦南地。因此，他们绝不是耶和华的军队。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7988</b></p><p><b>7988.</b>
That all the armies of Jehovah went forth from the land of Egypt. That this signifies that they who were in truth and good and were still detained there, were taken out, is evident from the signification 
of "going forth from the land of Egypt," as being to be taken out and liberated from infestations (that "to go forth" denotes to be taken out, is evident; and also that "the land of Egypt" denotes 
infestations, see n. 7278); and from the signification of "the armies of Jehovah," as being the truths and goods of the spiritual church, thus those who are in truth and good (n. 3448, 7236). That truths 
and goods are "the armies of Jehovah," is evident in Daniel: </p>
<p>     There went out one little horn of the he-goat, and it grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward comeliness; 
and it grew even to the army of the heavens; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the earth, and trampled upon them. Yea, it exalted itself even to the Prince of the army. And the 
army was delivered upon the continual sacrifice unto transgression, because it cast forth truth into the earth. Then I heard a holy one speaking, How long shall the holy thing and the army be given 
to be trampled on? He said unto me, Until the evening and the morning, two thousand three hundred; then shall the holy thing be justified (Dan. 8:9-14); </p>
<p>it is here clearly evident that "armies" denote 
truths and goods; for it is said that it "cast down to the earth some of the army and of the stars," and afterward that it "cast forth truth into the earth," and that "the army was to be trampled on 
until the evening and the morning," that is, until the coming of the Lord. [2] As truths and goods are the "armies of Jehovah," therefore the angels are called His "armies" in these passages: </p>
<p>    
 Micaiah the prophet said, I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and the whole army of the heavens standing by Him (1 Kings 22:19).      Bless Jehovah, ye His angels, mighty in strength. Bless Jehovah, 
all ye His armies, ye ministers of His (Ps. 103:20-21); </p>
<p>where the angels are called "armies" from the truths and goods in which they are. Nor were the angels only called "the armies of Jehovah," but 
also the luminaries of heaven, as the sun, moon, and stars, and this because by the "sun" was signified the good of love, by the "moon" the good of faith, and by the "stars" the knowledges of good and 
truth. That these luminaries are called "armies" is manifest in the book of Genesis: </p>
<p>     And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the army of them (Gen. 2:1); </p>
<p>where by "army" are meant 
all the luminaries of heaven; but in the internal sense, in which is here described the new creation of man, are meant truths and goods. [3] In like manner in David: </p>
<p>     Praise ye Jehovah, all His 
angels; praise ye Him, all His armies. Praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light (Ps. 148:2-3). That the "sun" denotes the good of love; the "moon" the good of faith, see n. 1529, 
1530, 2441, 2495, 4060, 4696, 5377, 7083; and that the "stars" denote the knowledges of good and truth, n. 1808, 2120, 2495, 2849, 4697. [4] That the "sun, moon, and stars" signify goods and truths, 
is because in heaven the Lord is a sun to the celestial angels, and a moon to the spiritual angels (n. 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643, 4300, 4321, 5097, 7078, 7083, 7171, 7173), and because the angelic 
abodes shine like the stars, according to these words in Daniel: </p>
<p>     Then shall the intelligent shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that make many righteous, as the stars forever 
and to eternity (Dan. 12:3). [5] As from truths and goods the angels are called "the armies of Jehovah," and so also the sun, moon, and stars; and as all truth and good proceed from the Lord; therefore 
in the Word the Lord is called "Jehovah Zebaoth" that is, "of armies" (n. 3448). He is so called also from the fact that He fights for man against the hells. From all this it can now be seen what is 
meant in the internal sense by "the armies of Jehovah." That the sons of Jacob, who went forth out of Egypt, were not these armies, but that they represented them, is evident from their life in Egypt, 
in that they did not know Jehovah, not even His name, until this was told to Moses out of the bramble (Exod. 3:13-16); and also that they, equally with the Egyptians, were worshipers of a calf, as 
may be concluded from the thirty-second chapter of Exodus; and also from their life in the wilderness, in that they were of such a character that they could not be introduced into the land of Canaan; 
thus were as far as possible from being the armies of Jehovah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7988</b></p><p><b>7988.</b>
'That all the hosts of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt' means that those with whom truth and good were present but who had been held back until then were released. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'going out of the land of Egypt' as being released and delivered from molestations, 'going out' self-evidently meaning being released, while 'the land of Egypt' means molestations, see <a href="7278.htm">7278</a>; and 
from the meaning of 'the hosts of Jehovah' as the truths and forms of good that the spiritual Church possesses, and so those with whom truth and good are present, dealt with in <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="7236.htm">7236</a>. The fact that 
truths and forms of good are meant by 'the hosts of Jehovah' is clear in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
There came out one small-sized horn of the he-goat, and it grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, 
and towards the glorious [land]. And it grew even towards the hosts of heaven, and cast down to the earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them. It drew itself up even towards the 
prince of the host. And the host was set over the continual [burnt offering] on account of the transgression, because it cast down truth to the earth. At that point I heard a holy one speaking, How 
long is both the sanctuary and the host being trodden down? He said to me, Up to the evening and morning, two thousand three hundred times; then the sanctuary will be made correct. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:9-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:9-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
it is plainly evident that 'the hosts' means truths and forms of good, for it says that [the hem] cast down to the earth some of the host and of the stars, and after this that it cast down truth to 
the earth, and that the host was to be trodden down up to the evening and morning, which is the Lord's Coming. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since truths and forms of good make up 'the hosts of Jehovah', angels are therefore 
called His 'hosts' in the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Micah the prophet said, I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and the entire host of heaven standing beside Him <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 22:19. </p>
<p>And in David, </p>
<p>Bless 
Jehovah, His angels, powerful with strength; bless Jehovah, all His hosts, His ministers. Ps. 103:20, <a href="21.htm">21</a>. </p>
<p>Angels are called 'hosts' by virtue of the truths and forms of good present with them. 
Not only angels used to be referred to as the hosts of Jehovah but also the lights in the sky - the sun, moon, and stars. And they were referred to as such because 'the sun' was a sign of the good of 
love, 'the moon' a sign of the good of faith, and 'the stars' a sign of cognitions of goodness and truth. Reference to those lights as 'hosts' is evident in the Book of Genesis, </p>
<p>The heavens and the 
earth were finished, and all their hosts. Gen. 1:1. </p>
<p>Here 'hosts' is used to mean all the lights in the sky; but in the internal sense, in which the subject at that point is the new creation of a 
person, 'hosts' is used to mean truths and forms of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Likewise in David, </p>
<p>Praise Jehovah, all His angels, praise Him, all His hosts; praise Him, sun and moon, praise Him, all stars of light. 
Ps.148:1, <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>'Sun' means the good of love, and 'moon' the good of faith, see <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4696.htm">4696</a>, <a href="5377.htm">5377</a>, <a href="7083.htm">7083</a>; and 'stars' means cognitions of good and truth,<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>, <a href="2120.htm">2120</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="4697.htm">4697</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 One reason why 'sun, moon, and stars' means forms of good and truths is that in heaven the Lord is a Sun to those who are celestial and a Moon to those who are spiritual, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, 
<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4300.htm">4300</a>, <a href="4721.htm">4721</a> (end), <a href="5097.htm">5097</a>, <a href="7078.htm">7078</a>, <a href="7083.htm">7083</a>, <a href="7171.htm">7171</a>, <a href="7173.htm">7173</a>; and another reason is that angelic dwelling-places shine like stars, in keeping with the following in Daniel,  </p>
<p>Then those who have intelligence 
will shine like the brightness of the expanse, and those who turn many to righteousness like the stars forever and into eternity. Dan. 12:9. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Since angels, by virtue of truths and forms 
of good, are spoken of as 'the hosts of Jehovah', and also the sun, moon, and stars are called such, and since all truth and good come from the Lord, the Word refers to the Lord as Jehovah Zebaoth, 
that is, Jehovah of Hosts, <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>. And another reason why it refers to Him in this way is that He fights on a person's behalf against the hells. </p>
<p>From all this one may now see what 'the hosts of Jehovah' 
is used to mean in the internal sense. The children of Jacob who went out of Egypt were not such, though they represented them. This is evident from their life in Egypt, where they were unacquainted 
with Jehovah, even with His name before it was made known to Moses from the bramble bush, Exod. 3:13-16; and also they were calf-worshippers no less than the Egyptians were, as may be deduced from 
Exodus <a href="32.htm">32</a>. And their life in the wilderness too shows that their character was such that they could not be led into the land of Canaan. Thus they were anything but the hosts of Jehovah. </p>

`Exiverunt omnes exercitus Jehovae e terra Aegypti': quod significet quod illi qui in vero et bono, et usque illuc detenti, exempti sint, constat ex significatione `exire e terra Aegypti' quod {1}sit 
eximi et liberari ab infestationibus; quod `exire' sit eximi, patet; et quod `terra Aegypti' sint infestationes, videatur n. 7278; et ex significatione `exercituum Jehovae' quod sint vera et bona quae 
Ecclesiae spirituali, ita illi qui in vero et bono sunt, de qua n. 3448, 7236.  Quod vera et bona sint `exercitus Jehovae,' constat apud Danielem, Exivit cornu unum de exiguo hirci, et crevit valde 
versus meridiem, et versus ortum, et versus decus, et crevit usque ad exercitus caelorum, et dejecit in terram de exercitu, et de stellis, et conculcavit {2}illa; immo usque ad, principem exercitus 
extulit se: et exercitus traditus est super jugi in praevaricationem, quia projecit veritatem in terram: tunc audivi unum sanctum loquentem, Quousque datur et sanctum et exercitus conculcationi? dixit 
ad me, Usque ad vesperam et mane, bis mille trecenta, tunc justificabitur sanctum, viii 9-14; </p>
<p>hic quod `exercitus' sint vera et bona, manifeste patet; dicitur enim quod `dejecerit in terram de exercitu 
et de stellis' ac postea quod `{3}projecit veritatem in terram' et quod `exercitus esset conculcationi usque ad vesperam et mane,' hoc est, ad Adventum Domini. 	2 Quia vera et bona sunt exercitus 
Jehovae, idcirco angeli vocantur `exercitus Ipsius' in Libro 1 Regum, Michah propheta dixit, Vidi Jehovam sedentem super throno Suo, ac universum exercitum caelorum stantem juxta Ipsum, xxii 19: </p>
<p>et 
apud Davidem, Benedicite Jehovae, angeli Ipsius, potentes robore; benedicite Jehovae, omnes exercitus Ipsius, ministri Ipsius, Ps. ciii 20, 21; </p>
<p>angeli vocantur `exercitus' a veris et bonis in quibus 
sunt; nec solum angeli dicebantur exercitus Jehovae, sed etiam luminaria caeli, ut sol, luna, ac stellae, et hoc quia per `solem' significabatur bonum amoris, per `lunam' bonum fidei, et per `stellas' 
cognitiones boni et veri: quod illa luminaria dicantur `exercitus,' patet in Libro Geneseos, Absoluti sunt caeli et terra, et omnes exercitus illorum, ii 1, ubi per `exercitus' intelliguntur omnia 
luminaria caeli, at in sensu interno, in quo ibi agitur de nova creatione hominis, intelliguntur 3 vera et bona: pariter apud Davidem, Laudate Jehovam, omnes angeli Ipsius, laudate Ipsum, omnes exercitus 
Ipsius; laudate Ipsum, sol et luna, laudate Ipsum, omnes stellae lucis, Ps. cxlviii 2, 3; </p>
<p>quod `sol' sit bonum amoris, et `luna' bonum fidei, videatur n. 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 4060, 4696, 5377, 
7083, et quod {4}`stellae' sint cognitiones boni et veri, n. 1808, 2120, 2495, 2849, 4697. 	4 Quod `sol, luna, et stellae' significent bona et vera, est quia Dominus in caelo est Sol caelestibus 
ac Luna spiritualibus, n. 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643, 4300, 4321 fin., 5097, 7078, 7083, 7171, 7173; et quia domicilia angelica lucent sicut stellae, secundum haec apud Danielem, Tunc intelligentes 
splendebunt sicut splendor expansi, et justificantes multos sicut stellae in saeculum et aeternitatem, xii 3. 	5 (m)Quia angeli ex veris et bonis vocantur `exercitus Jehovae' et quoque `sol, luna, et 
stellae,' et omne verum et bonum procedit a Domino, ideo Dominus in Verbo {5}appellatur Jehovah Zebaoth seu Exercituum, n. 3448; {5}appellatur etiam ex eo, {6}quia pugnat pro homine contra inferna.(n) 
 Ex his nunc constare potest quid in sensu interno intelligitur per `exercitus Jehovae'; quod filii Jacobi, qui exiverunt ex Aegypto, non fuerint, sed quod repraesentaverint, patet ex vita illorum in 
Aegypto, quod non cognoverint Jehovam, ne quidem nomen Ipsius, antequam hoc Moschi indicatum esset e rubo, Exod. iii 13-16; tum quod fuerint aeque ac (x)Aegyptii adoratores vituli, ut concludi potest 
ex Exod. xxxii; {7}tum ex vita illorum in deserto, quod fuerint tales ut non potuerint introduci in terram Canaanem; ita nihil minus quam exercitus Jehovae. 	@1 sint$ 	@2 illos$ 	@3 projecerit$ 	@4
