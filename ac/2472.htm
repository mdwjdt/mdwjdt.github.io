<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2472.</strong> 正因如此，人活在肉身时若不使用有声语言，即话语，就无法彼此交谈；若不熟悉这些语言，就无法理解彼此，因为他们的言语来自外部记忆。而灵人彼此交谈所使用的，则是一种普遍语言，这种语言被分为诸如构成思维本身的观念。因此，他们能与任何灵人交谈，无论他在世时用的是哪种语言，在哪个国家，因为他们的言语来自内部记忆。死后，人人都会进入这种语言，因为他已进入内部记忆，如前所述，内部记忆适合他的灵（参看<a href="1637.htm">1637</a>，<a href="1639.htm">1639</a>，<a href="1757.htm">1757</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>节）。</p>

Hence it is that men while living in the body cannot speak with each other except by means of languages distinguished into articulate sounds, that is, into words, and are unable to understand one another 
unless they are acquainted with these languages, for the reason that their speech is from the exterior memory. Whereas spirits speak with each other by means of a universal language distinguished 
into ideas such as are of thought itself, and thus they can have converse with any spirit whatever, of whatever language and nation he had been while in the world, for the reason that their speech is 
from the interior memory. Into this language comes every man immediately after death, because he comes into this memory, which, as before said, is proper to his spirit (see n. 1637, 1639, 1757, 1876). </p>

This being so, people cannot speak to one another while in the body except by means of languages consisting of articulated sounds, that is, by means of separable words, and are incapable of understanding 
one another if they do not know those languages, the reason being that their speech is formed from the exterior memory. But spirits speak to one another by means of a universal language that is distinguished 
into ideas such as comprise thought itself. They are in this manner able to mix with any other spirit, whatever his language or nationality had been in the world, the reason being that their 
speech is formed from the interior memory. Everybody enters into the use of this latter language immediately after death because he enters into use of the interior memory, which, as stated, belongs 
properly to his spirit, see <a href="1637.htm">1637</a>, <a href="1639.htm">1639</a>, <a href="1757.htm">1757</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>. </p>

</p><b>2472.</b>
Inde est quod homines dum vivunt in corpore, non inter se loqui possint quam per linguas in sonos articulatos hoc est, in voces discretas, et se mutuo intelligere nequeant nisi linguas istas calleant, 
ex causa quia hoc fit ex memoria exteriore: at quod spiritus inter se loquantur per linguam universalem, in ideas quales sunt ipsius cogitationis, distinctam, et sic quod conversari possint cum unoquovis 
spiritu, cujuscumque linguae et nationis in mundo fuerat, ex causa quia hoc fit ex memoria interiore; in hanc linguam venit unusquisque homo statim post mortem, quia in hanc memoriam, quae, ut 
dictum, est propria ejus spiritus; videantur n. 1637, 1639, 1757, 1876. </p>
