<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2128节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2128.</strong>诸如发生在恶人面前的最后审判，我曾见证过两、三次。对它的概念如下：我周围的灵人结成具有破坏性的社群，他们在其中占据优势，并且不愿照秩序服从平衡法则的管理，从而不去过分骚扰其它社群，或以其压倒性的力量苦害他们。这时，一个大型灵人中队从前面稍向右靠上的地区而来。当他们接近时，只听见一阵海浪咆哮般的喧嚣声。一听到这个声音，这些灵人都惊惶失措，以致造成混乱。就在此时，这些社群里的灵人有的以这种方式，有的以那种方式被四散开来，以致他们相互分离，并且不知道彼此的下落。在这些灵人看来，所有这一切仿佛是一场伴随毁灭所有事物的最后审判。有的发出哀号，有的因恐惧而魂飞魄散。总之，他们全都充满一种类似最后关头的危机感。<br />他们以不同的方式听到从靠前的地区逼近的那些声音，有的感觉像是骑兵的声音，有的感觉像其它声音，这取决于他们恐惧的状态和它所引发的幻觉。我本人则觉得它就像起伏不断的低语，事实上，如同很多人同时低语。我身边的人告诉我，当社群以这种方式邪恶地集结起来时，像这样的中队就从那个地区而来。我被告知，他们知道如何拆散他们，并将其彼此分开，同时知道如何以恐惧击打他们，以致他们只想逃离。我进一步得知，凭着这种分离和驱散，所有人最终被主归入秩序。我还被告知，这就是圣言中“东风”所表示的。</p>

The idea of a Last Judgment as presented to the evil, which I have seen two or three times, was as follows. When the spirits around me had combined into mischievous societies, so as to exercise predominance, 
and did not suffer themselves to be so governed by the law of equilibrium according to order as not to annoy other societies in an excessive manner, and to begin inflicting injury upon them by 
their overpowering force, there then appeared a band of spirits of considerable magnitude, coming from the quarter in front, a little to the right and above, at the approach of which there was heard 
a hubbub that as it were rose and fell with a loud roar; and as soon as the spirits heard it they were seized with consternation and terror, the result of which was a confusion; and then the spirits 
who were in those societies were dispersed, one this way and another that, so that they dissolved away from one another, and no one knew where his companion was. While this lasted, it appeared to the 
spirits just as if it were the Last Judgment with the destruction of all things. Some uttered lamentations; some from fright as it were lost all heart; in a word, a sense of danger as of a final crisis 
seized on all.  [2] The sound of those advancing from the quarter in front was heard by them variously; by some as the sound of armed horsemen, and by others otherwise, according to their state of 
fear and the phantasy it excited. It was perceived by me as a continuous murmur, with undulations rising and falling, and indeed as of many together. I was instructed by those near me that such bands 
come from that quarter when societies have been evilly combined in this way, and that they know how to dissociate and dissever the one from the other, and at the same time to strike terror, so that nothing 
is thought of but flight; and that by means of such disjunctions and dispersions all are at last reduced by the Lord into order. I was also told that this is what is signified in the Word by the 
"east wind." </p>

The idea of a Last Judgement as it took place before the eyes of the evil, such as I have witnessed two or three times, has been as follows: When the spirits around me had so amalgamated into destructive 
communities that they were in the ascendancy and did not allow themselves, by the law of equilibrium which order ensures, to be controlled in such a way that they did not vex other communities excessively 
or begin to do them harm from their superior strength, a sizable squadron of spirits then appeared on the scene from the quarter in front, slightly to the right and above. As they approached 
a tumultuous sound was heard, as if coming in waves and roaring. When they heard it the spirits were filled with dismay and terror, and confusion resulted. At that point the spirits within those communities 
were scattered, one this way and another that, so that they melted away from one another and did not know one anothers' whereabouts. While all this was taking place it seemed to those spirits 
just as if it was a Last Judgement accompanied by the destruction of all things. Some uttered lamentations, others in terror lost heart so to speak; in short, a sense of doom like that of a final reckoning 
was seizing them all. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The sound of those approaching from the quarter in front was heard by them in different ways. To some it was the sound of armed cavalry, to others something else, all 
depending on their state of fear and the delusions this aroused in them. I myself perceived it as a continuous rumbling coming in waves, and indeed of many doing so simultaneously. I was informed by 
those near me that squadrons like these arrive on the scene from that quarter when communities have, as has been stated, been harmfully grouped together in this manner. They know, I was told, how to 
break them up and part them one from another, and at the same time how to strike terror into them, so that their one thought is to take flight. I was further informed that by means of disbandments and 
dispersals all spirits are then brought back into order by the Lord, and also that such activity is meant in the Word by 'the east wind'. </p>

Idea ultimi judicii coram malis, quae his et ter mihi visa, talis fuit: cum spiritus circum me conjunxerunt se in societates perniciosas sic ut praevalerent, nec ex lege aequilibrii secundum ordinem 
se regi ita paterentur quin alias societates insolenter lacesserent et damnum illis inferre vi praevalente inciperent, tunc apparuit spirituum cohors satis magna a plaga anteriore paulum ad dextrum superne, 
ex qua adventante auditus tumultus quasi fluctuans et grandisonans; quo audito facta est inter spiritus {1} consternatio cum terrore, et inde confusio, et tunc qui in illos societatibus {2} erant, 
dissipabantur, unus huc alter illuc, sic ut diffluerent a mutuo et non sciret socius ubi socius; cum hoc perstabat, non aliter apparuit spiritibus quam sicut ultimum judicium cum interitu omnium; 
quidam lamentabantur, quidam prae terrore absque quasi corde erant, verbo, omnes occupabat discrimen quasi ultimi cujusdam; [2] sonitus adventantium a plaga anteriore illis auditus varie, quibusdam tanquam 
sonitus equitum armatorum, quibusdam aliter, secundum statum timoris et inde phantasiae [eorum]; mihi apperceptus ut susurrus continuus cum undulatione alterna, et quidem plurima simul: instruebar 
ab illis qui prope {3} me, quod tales cohortes ab illa plaga veniant quando societates ita male confarctae sunt, ut dictum, et quod illi sciant dissociare et discindere unum ab altero, et simul incutere 
terrorem ut nihil aliud cogitent quam fugam; et quod, per tales disjunctiones et dissipationes, omnes dein redigantur in ordinem a Domino; tum etiam quod tale in Verbo significetur {4} per `ventum 
orientalem.' 	@1 inter spiritus facta est.$ 	@2 i conjuncti.$ 	@3 apud.$ 	@4 i quoque.$ </p>
