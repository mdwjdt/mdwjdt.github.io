<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6426节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6426.</strong>“以色列的牧者、石头是从那里而出的”表属灵国度所拥有的一切良善与真理皆源于此。这从“牧者”和“石头”的含义，以及“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“牧者”是指通过信之真理引向仁之良善的人（参看<a href="344.htm">344</a>，<a href="3795.htm">3795</a>，<a href="6044.htm">6044</a>节），此处因论述主而在至高意义上表示良善与真理本身；“石头”是指真理（参看<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>，<a href="3771.htm">3771</a>，<a href="3773.htm">3773</a>，<a href="3789.htm">3789</a>，<a href="3798.htm">3798</a>节）；“以色列”是指属灵教会（参看<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节），因为“以色列”是指属灵良善，或真理之良善（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>，<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）。由于真理之良善是属灵教会的本质要素，故“以色列”表示属灵教会，在至高意义上表示主的属灵国度。由此明显可知，“以色列的牧者、石头是从那里而出的”表示主的属灵国度所拥有的一切良善与真理皆源于此。<br />“以色列的石头”在至高意义上之所以表示在祂的属灵国度所拥有的真理方面的主，是因为“石头”一般表示圣殿，尤表圣殿立于其上的根基。“圣殿”反过来又表示主的神性人身，这清楚可见于约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>），它的“根基”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.42.htm">21:42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.44.htm">44</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.16.htm">28:16</a>）也是如此。“石头”在至高意义上表示祂的属灵国度所拥有的神性真理方面的主，这一点明显可见于诗篇：<br />匠人所弃的石头，已成了房角的头一块。这是耶和华所做的，在我们眼中看为希奇。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗118.22.htm">118:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗118.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“石头”在此是指主，这一点清楚可见于路加福音：<br />经上记着，匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头一块，凡掉在那石头上的，必要跌碎；那石头掉在谁的身上，就要把谁砸得稀烂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.17.htm">20:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.18.htm">18</a>）<br />主的这些话是指着自己说的。以赛亚书：<br />以祂为你们所当怕的，所当畏惧的。祂必作为圣所，却向以色列两家作绊脚的石头，跌人的磐石；他们中间有许多人必绊脚跌倒，而且跌碎。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.13.htm">8:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处论述的是主。<br />主耶和华如此说，看哪，我在锡安放一块石头作为根基，是试验过的石头，是稳固根基，宝贵的房角石，信靠的人必不着急。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.16.htm">28:16</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />万军之耶和华眷顾自己的羊群，就是犹大家，必使他们如战场上的骏马。房角石从祂而出，钉子从祂而出，争战的弓从祂而出。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.3.htm">10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />你正观看，有一块石头未经人手凿出来，它打在这像半铁半泥的脚上，把脚砸碎，打碎这像的石头变成一块大磐石，充满全地。天上的神必另立一国，永不败坏，祂的国也不归别的人民，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，它自己却必存立到永远。你既看见一块石头未经人手凿出来，它打碎铁、铜、泥、银、金。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.34.htm">2:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.44.htm">44</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.45.htm">45</a>）<br />此处“石头”在至高意义上表示主，在相对意义上表示祂的属灵国度；石头“从磐石凿出来”，表示它出于信之真理，因为在圣言中，“磐石”表示信之真理。“石头”和“磐石”因表示信之真理，故也表示主的属灵国度，因为由这真理所产生的信之真理，以及良善普遍存在于该国度。<br />雅各睡觉所枕、后来立为柱子的“石头”所表相同，对此，经上描述如下：<br />雅各睡醒了，说，耶和华真在这地方，我竟不知道。就惧怕说，这地方何等可畏！这不是别的，乃是神的家，这是天的门。雅各清晨早早起来，拿当枕头所放的石头，立作柱子，在它头顶浇油。我所立为柱子的石头也必作神的殿。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.16.htm">28:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.22.htm">22</a>）<br />就至高意义而言，古人将“石头”理解为主，就相对意义而言，理解为祂的属灵国度。这一事实也清楚可见于约书亚记：<br />约书亚将一块石头立在耶和华的圣所中的橡树下。约书亚对众百姓说，看哪！这石头可以向我们作见证；因为是听见了耶和华所吩咐我们的一切话，倘或你们背弃你们的神，这石头就可以向你们作见证。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.26.htm">24:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.27.htm">27</a>）</p>

From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel. That this signifies that from this is all good and truth in the spiritual kingdom, is evident from the signification of a "shepherd," as being one who 
leads to the good of charity by means of the truth of faith (see n. 344, 3795, 6044); here in the supreme sense, because the Lord is treated of, it signifies good and truth itself; from the signification 
of "stone," as being truth (see n. 1298, 3720, 3769, 3771, 3773, 3789, 3798); and from the representation of Israel, as being the spiritual church (see n. 3305, 4286); for "Israel" is spiritual 
good, or the good of truth (n. 4286, 4598, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and as the good of truth is the very essential of the spiritual church, therefore by "Israel" the spiritual 
church is signified, and in a higher sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom. [2] From all this it is evident that by "from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel" is signified that from this is all 
the good and truth of the Lord's spiritual kingdom. That in the highest sense the "stone of Israel" denotes the Lord in respect to the truth that is in His spiritual kingdom, is because by "stone" in 
general is signified the temple, and specifically its foundation, and by the "temple" is signified the Lord's Divine Human (as is evident in John 2:19, 21), and also by its foundation (Matt. 21:42, 44; 
and Isa. 28:16). That in the highest sense a "stone" denotes the Lord as to the Divine truth that is of His spiritual kingdom, is evident in David: </p>
<p>     The stone which the architects rejected, is 
become the head of the corner. This was done from Jehovah: it is marvelous in our eyes (Ps. 118:22, 23). That the "stone" here is the Lord, is evident in Luke: </p>
<p>     It is written, The stone which the 
architects rejected, the same is become the head of the  whosoever shall fall upon this stone shall be broken; but upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder (Luke 20:17, 18); </p>
<p>these 
words the Lord speaks concerning Himself. And in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread; for He shall be for a sanctuary, although a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, 
to the two houses of Israel; many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken (Isa. 8:13-15); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is the Lord. Again: </p>
<p>     Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold I will lay 
for a foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, of a precious corner, of a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not hurry (Isa. 28:16). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah Zebaoth shall visit His flock, 
the house of Judah, and shall make them as a horse of glory in war; from Him is the corner stone, from Him the nail, from Him the war bow (Zech. 10:3, 4).  [3] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     Thou sawest even until 
a stone was cut out which was not done with hands, and it smote the image upon its feet, that were iron and clay, and brake them in pieces. The stone that smote the image became a great rock, and 
filled the whole earth. The God of the heavens shall make a kingdom rise up that shall not be destroyed forever, nor shall His kingdom be left to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all 
these kingdoms, but itself shall stand forever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the rock, which was not done with hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, 
the silver, and the gold (Dan. 2:34, 35, 44, 45); </p>
<p>here by a "stone" in the highest sense is meant the Lord, and in the relative sense His spiritual kingdom; that the stone was "cut out of a rock" 
signifies that it was from the truth of faith, for this is signified in the Word by a "rock;" and as the truth of faith is signified by "stone" and "rock," it is the Lord's spiritual kingdom that is 
also signified, for this is in the truth of faith, and from this in good. [4] By the "stone" also upon which Jacob slept, and which he afterward set for a pillar, the like is signified, of which it is 
written: </p>
<p>     Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I knew it not; and he feared, and said, How terrible is this place! this is nothing but the house of God, 
and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had set for his pillows, and set it for a pillar, and poured oil upon the head of it; and he said, 
This stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house (Gen. 28:16-18, 22). That in the highest sense the ancients understood the Lord by a "stone," and in the representative sense His spiritual 
kingdom, is also clear in Joshua: </p>
<p>     Joshua set up a stone under the oak that was in the sanctuary of Jehovah. And Joshua said unto the universal people, Behold, this stone shall be to us for a 
witness; for it hath heard all the discourses of Jehovah, which He spake to us; and it shall be for a witness against you, lest ye deny your God (Josh. 24:26, 27). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6426</b></p><p><b>6426.</b>
'From there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel' means that from this springs all the goodness and truth which the spiritual kingdom possesses. This is clear from the meaning of 'the shepherd' as one 
who leads to the good of charity by means of the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="3795.htm">3795</a>, <a href="6044.htm">6044</a> (here in the highest sense, since it has reference to the Lord, goodness and truth themselves are meant); 
from the meaning of 'the stone' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="3769.htm">3769</a>, <a href="3771.htm">3771</a>, <a href="3773.htm">3773</a>, <a href="3789.htm">3789</a>, <a href="3798.htm">3798</a>; and from the representation of 'Israel' as the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, for 'Israel'

And since the good of truth is the essential element of the spiritual Church, 'Israel' means the 
spiritual Church, and in the highest sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom. From all this it is evident that 'from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel' means that from this springs all the goodness 
and truth which the Lord's spiritual kingdom possesses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why in the highest sense 'the stone of Israel' means the Lord with respect to the truth that His spiritual kingdom possesses 
is that in general 'the stone' means the temple, and specifically the foundation on which it stands. 'The temple' in turn means the Lord's Divine Human, as is clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%202:19,21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 2:19,21</a>, and so does its 
'foundation' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2021:42,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 21:42, 44</a>, and in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2028:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 28:16</a>. This meaning of 'the stone' in the highest sense - the Lord in respect to Divine Truth which His spiritual kingdom possesses - is evident in David, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This has been done by Jehovah; it is marvellous in our eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20118:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 118:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The stone' here is the Lord, as is made 
clear in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
It is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. Whoever falls onto that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind 
him to powder. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2020:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 20:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These things are spoken by the Lord regarding Himself. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He is your fear, and He is your dread; for He will be a sanctuary, though He will be a stone 
to strike against and a rock to stumble over<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for both houses of Israel. Many among them will trip, and fall, and be broken to pieces. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%208:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 8:13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Lord is referred to. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
Lord Jehovih said, Behold I [am He who] will lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tested stone, a precious corner-stone, surely founded. He who believes will not be hasty. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2028:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 28:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah Zebaoth will visit His flock, the house of Judah, and will place them as His glorious horse<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> in battle. From Him comes the corner-stone, from Him the tent-peg, from Him the battle-bow. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2010:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 10:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
You were watching, until a stone was cut out, not by means of hands, and it struck the statue on its feet, which were iron and clay, and smashed them to 
pieces. The stone that struck the statue became a great rock and filled the whole earth. The God of heaven will cause a kingdom to arise that will never be destroyed, and His kingdom will not be left 
to other people; it will crush and consume all those kingdoms, but will itself stand for ever. Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the rock, not by means of hands, and it smashed the iron, 
the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold . . . <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:34,%2035,%2044,%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:34, 35, 44, 45</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the stone' is used in the highest sense to mean the Lord, and in the relative sense to mean His spiritual kingdom. 
When it says that 'the stone was cut out of the rock' the meaning is that it came out of the truth of faith, for the truth of faith is meant in the Word by 'rock'. And because the truth of faith is 
meant by 'the stone' and 'the rock', the Lord's spiritual kingdom is also what is meant, since the truth of faith and good ensuing from this truth prevail in that kingdom. Something similar is also meant 
by 'the stone' on which Jacob slept and which he afterwards set up as a pillar, described as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place and I did not know it. 
And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is nothing other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And in the morning Jacob rose up early, and took the stone which 
he had placed as his headrest, and placed it as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He said, This stone which I have placed as a pillar will be God's house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:16-18,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:16-18, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that by 
'the stone' the ancients understood the Lord in the highest sense and His spiritual kingdom in the relative sense is also plain to see in Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
Joshua erected the stone under the oak which was 
in Jehovah's sanctuary. And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone will be a witness to us, for it has heard all the sayings of Jehovah which He spoke to us. And it shall be a witness against 
you, lest you deny your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2024:26,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 24:26, 17</a>.

significetur quod inde omne bonum et verum spirituali regno Domini.  [2]Quod `lapis Israelis' sit in supremo sensu Dominus quoad verum quod regno Ipsius spirituali, est quia per `lapidem' (t)in genere 
significatur templum, et in specie fundamentum ejus, et per `templum' significatur Divinum Humanum Domini, ut {2}constat apud Johannem ii 19, 21; et quoque per `fundamentum' ejus, apud Matthaeum 
xxi 42,44; et apud Esaiam xxviii 16.  Quod `lapis' in supremo sensu sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum quod regno Ipsius spirituali, patet apud Davidem, Lapis quem rejecerunt architecti, factus est in caput

<p>hic per `lapidem' 
in supremo sensu {6}intelligitur Dominus, et in sensu respectivo regnum Ipsius spirituale; quod `lapis excisus sit e petra' significat quod e vero fidei, nam id per `petram' in Verbo significatur, 
et quia verum fidei per `lapidem et petram', est regnum Domini spirituale quod etiam significatur, hoc enim in vero fidei et inde in bono est.  Per `lapidem' etiam super quo dormivit Jacob, et quem 
dein posuit in statuam, simile significatur, de quo ita,  Expergefactus Jacob e somno suo, et dixit, Certe est Jehovah  in loco hoc, et ego non scivi: et timuit et dixit, Quam terribilis locus hic, 
nihil hic nisi domus Dei, et haec porta caeli:  et mane surrexit Jacob in matutino, et sumpsit lapidem quem posuerat sub capitalia sua, et posuit illum statuam, et fudit oleum super caput ejus; . . . 
dixit; Lapis hic, quem posui statuam, erit domus Dei, Gen. xxviii 16-18, (x)22. Quod per `lapidem' ab antiquis intellectus sit Dominus in supremo sensu, et regnum Ipsius spirituale in sensu repraesentativo, 
etiam liquet apud Joshuam, Erexit Joshua lapidem, sub quercu quae in sanctuario Jehovae;et dixit Joshua ad universum populum, Ecce lapis hic erit nobis in testem; audivit enim ille omnes sermones 
Jehovae, quos locutus est nobiscum; et erit in testem contra (x)vos, ne abnegetis Deum vestrum,: xxiv 26,27. @1 inde$ @2 patet$ @3 patet$ @4 ubi$ @5 de $ @6 significatur$ </p>
