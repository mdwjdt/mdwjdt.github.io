<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6652节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6652.</strong>“不认识约瑟的”表它们完全疏远内在。这从“不认识”的含义和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“不认识”是指疏远，因为凡不认识真理，不想认识真理的人都与教会的真理疏远（此处所表示的是疏远，这一事实从下文明显看出来，因为这个王既严厉又无情地苦害以色列人，而以色列人代表教会，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）；“约瑟”是指内在（<a href="6177.htm">6177</a>，<a href="6224.htm">6224</a>节）。疏远内在的记忆知识是反对教会的记忆知识，因为构成教会的良善与真理经由内在流入。不过，如果它们不被属世层接受，内在就会关闭；如此这个人就疏远了良善与真理，然后属世层中除了虚假的记忆知识外，再没有可被视为真理的其它记忆知识了。这些虚假随后也会增多，而真理本身则被逐出门外。</p>

Who knew not Joseph. That this signifies which were completely alienated from the internal, is evident from the signification of "not knowing," as being to be alienated; for he who does not know truth, 
and does not desire to know it, is alienated from the truth of the church (that alienation is here signified is plain from what follows, for he severely and cruelly afflicted the sons of Israel, by 
whom is represented the church, n. 6637); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6177, 6224). Memory-knowledges alienated from the internal are memory-knowledges opposed to 
the church; for the good and truth which make the church flow in through the internal; and if these are not received by the natural, the internal is closed, and so the man is alienated from good and truth, 
and then no other memory-knowledges which are in the natural are acknowledged as truths than those which are false. These are then multiplied, and the truths themselves are cast out of doors. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6652</b></p><p><b>6652.</b>
'Who did not know Joseph' means which is completely alienated from the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'not knowing as being alienated, for anyone who does not know the truth and does not 
wish to know it is alienated from the Church's truth (the fact that alienation is meant here is evident from what follows, for the king afflicted the sons of Israel - who represent the Church, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a> - 
harshly and rigorously); and from the representation of 'Joseph' as the internal, dealt with in <a href="6177.htm">6177</a>, <a href="6224.htm">6224</a>. Factual knowledge alienated from the internal is factual knowledge opposed to the Church, for 
the goodness and truth that constitute the Church flow in by way of the internal. But if they are not received by the natural the internal is closed, and so the person is alienated from goodness and 
truth. When this happens no other factual knowledge in the natural is recognized as true than that which is false. These falsities then multiply, while genuine truths are banished out of doors. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6652</b>
</p><b>6652.</b>
`Qui non novit Josephum': quod significet quae prorsus abalienata ab interno, constat ex significatione `non nosse' quod sit abalienatum esse, nam qui non novit verum, et non novisse vult, is a vero 
Ecclesiae abalienatus est; quod abalienatio (t)hic significetur {1}, patet a sequentibus, nam duriter et saeve affixit filios Israelis, per quos repraesentatur Ecclesia, n. 6637; et ex repraesentatione 
`Josephi' quod sit internum, de qua n. 6177, 6224; scientifica abalienata ab interno sunt scientifica opposita Ecclesiae; nam bonum et verum quae faciunt Ecclesiam influunt per internum; quae si non 
recipiuntur a naturali, {2}clauditur internum, et sic homo abalienatur a bono et vero, et tunc scientifica quae in naturali, non alia pro scientificis veris agnoscuntur quam quae falsa sunt; haec tunc 
multiplicantur, et ipsa vera foras exterminantur. 	@1 i per non nosse$ 	@2 est internum clausum$ </p>
