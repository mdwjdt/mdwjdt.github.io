<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6993节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6993.</strong>“我必与你口同在，指教你所当说的话”表从神性人身发出、在每一个事物中的神性。这从“与口同在”和“指教你所当说的话”的含义清楚可知：“与口同在”当由耶和华来说时，是指与它/他所说的话同在（“口”表示话语，参看<a href="6987.htm">6987</a>，<a href="6988.htm">6988</a>节），由于这些话是向摩西说的，而摩西代表神性人身中的神之律法方面的主，故“我必与你口同在”表示从神性人身发出的事物中的神性；“指教你所当说的话”是指发出。因为“指教”和“说话”表示流入，当论及主的神性时，则表示发出。因为从主的神性人身本身发出神性真理，也就是所谓的“圣灵”；由于当主在世时，祂本身就是神性真理，所以祂自己指教爱与信的事物，那时不是通过圣灵而如此行的，如祂自己在约翰福音所教导的：<br />圣灵还没有来，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.39.htm">7:39</a>）<br />但主复活后甚至在人身方面也变成耶和华，也就是神性良善之后，就不再是神性真理，但这神性真理从祂的神性良善发出。“圣灵”就是从主的神性人身，而非自永恒就存在的任何灵人或灵人们发出的神性真理；这一点从主在上述经文中的话，即“圣灵还没有来”，以及这一事实很明显地看出来：一个灵人本身无法从祂发出，只有与这个灵人同在的神圣之物才能从祂发出，也就是说，某种神圣事物从主发出并被一个灵人说出来（参看<a href="6788.htm">6788</a>节）。<br />由此可知，整个三位一体，即圣父、圣子、圣灵完全在主里面；因此，只有一位神，而不是有三个神，彼此有别的三位格可以说构成一神性或一个神。在圣言中，经上提及“圣父、圣子、圣灵”，是为了叫人们能承认主和祂里面的神性。因为人类以前和今天一样陷入如此的黑暗，以致他们无法以其它任何方式承认主人身里面的任何神性；它因完全不为人所理解，故完全超越一切信仰。此外，这是一个真理，即：有一个三位一体，但这三位一体在一位，也就是主里面；基督教会也承认，三位一体完整地存在于祂里面。另外，主明确教导，祂与父为一（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">14:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.12.htm">12</a>）；神圣之物，就是圣灵所说的话，不是圣灵的，乃是主的；约翰福音：<br />保惠师，就是真理的圣灵，不是凭自己说的，乃是把祂所听见的都说出来。祂要荣耀我，因为祂要将受于我的告诉你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.14.htm">14</a>）<br />经上在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">14:26</a>）说明，“保惠师”就是圣灵。</p>

And I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt speak. That this signifies the Divine in each and all things which proceed from the Divine Human is evident from the signification of 
"being with the mouth," when said by Jehovah, as being to be with what he utters (that by the "mouth" is signified utterance, see n. 6987, 6988), and as these things are said to Moses, by whom is represented 
the Lord as to the law Divine in the Divine Human, therefore by "I will be with thy mouth" is signified the Divine in the things which proceed from the Divine Human; and from the signification 
of "teaching thee what thou shalt say" as being to proceed; for by "teaching" and by "speaking" is signified to flow in, and when said of the Divine of the Lord, it signifies to proceed. For from the 
Lord's Divine Human itself proceeds Divine truth, which is called the "Holy Spirit"; and because when the Lord was in the world He was Himself the Divine truth, He Himself taught the things that were 
of love and faith, and at that time not by the Holy Spirit, as He Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39). But after the Lord even 
as to the Human was made Jehovah, that is, Divine good, which was after the resurrection, then He was no longer Divine truth, but this proceeded from His Divine good. That the "Holy Spirit" is the Divine 
truth which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human, and not any spirit or spirits from eternity, is very evident from the Lord's words in the passage above cited, namely, that "the Holy Spirit was 
not yet"; also that a spirit cannot himself proceed, but the holy of the spirit, that is, the holy which proceeds from the Lord, and which a spirit utters (see also n. 6788). [2] From all this then 
it follows that the whole trinity, namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is perfect in the Lord, and thus that there is one God, and not three, who being distinct as to persons are said to constitute 
one Divine. That in the Word mention has been made of "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" was that men might acknowledge the Lord and also the Divine in Him. For man was in such thick darkness, as he also 
is at this day, that otherwise he would not have acknowledged any Divine in the Lord's Human; for this, being wholly incomprehensible, would have been to him above all belief. And moreover it is a truth 
that there is a Trine, but in one, namely, in the Lord; and it is also acknowledged in Christian churches that the Trine dwells perfectly in Him. Moreover, the Lord openly taught that He was one with 
the Father (John 14:9-12); and that the holy, which the Holy Spirit speaks, is not of the Spirit but of the Lord; in John: </p>
<p>     The Paraclete, the Spirit of truth, will not speak from Himself, but 
whatever He hears, He will speak. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine, and announce it to you (John 16:13-14). That the "Paraclete" is the Holy Spirit is said in John 14:26. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6993</b></p><p><b>6993.</b>
'And I will be with your mouth, and teach you the things you will speak' means the Divine in every single thing that emanates from the Divine Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'being with the 
mouth', when said by Jehovah, as being with the things it utters ('mouth' meaning utterance, see above in <a href="6987.htm">6987</a>, <a href="6988.htm">6988</a>), and since these words are addressed to Moses, who represents the Lord in respect 
of the law of God in the Divine Human, 'I will be with your mouth' means the Divine in the things that emanate from the Divine Human; and from the meaning  of 'teaching you the things you will speak' 
as emanating. For 'teaching and 'speaking' mean flowing in; but when they are used in reference to the Lord's Divine, emanating is meant. For from the Lord's Divine Human emanates Divine Truth, which 
is called the Holy Spirit. And since the Lord when He was in the world was Himself Divine Truth, He taught matters of love and faith. He did not do so at that time through the Holy Spirit, as He teaches 
in John, </p>
<blockquote>
The Holy Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%207:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 7:39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But after the Lord had become Jehovah, that is, Divine Good, in respect of the Human also, which was after 
the Resurrection, He was no longer Divine Truth. This now emanated instead from His Divine Good. The fact that the Holy Spirit is Divine Truth which emanates from the Lord's Divine Human, and not any 
spirit or spirits existing from eternity, is plainly evident from the Lord's words in the text quoted above - 'the Holy Spirit was not yet' - as well as from the consideration that a spirit himself cannot 
emanate from Him, only that which is holy with a spirit, that is, something holy which emanates from the Lord and is uttered by the spirit. See also <a href="6788.htm">6788</a>. </p>

 From all this it now follows that 
within the Lord the entire Trinity is complete; that is to say, within Him are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and thus that there is one God, not three who, though persons distinct from one another, 
are said to constitute one Deity. In the Word the names Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were used in order that people might acknowledge the Lord and also the Divine within Him. For mankind was in such thick 
darkness, as it also is at the present day, that it could not in any other way have acknowledged anything Divine in the Lord's Human; being wholly incomprehensible to them it would have been entirely 
beyond belief. Furthermore the truth is that there is a Trinity, but within one, who is the Lord; and Christian Churches also acknowledge that the Trinity resides within Him in completeness. In addition 
the Lord explicitly taught that He was one with the Father, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:9-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:9-12</a>, and that what is holy, which is spoken by the Holy Spirit, is not the Spirit's but the Lord's, in John, </p>
<p>The Paraclete, 
the Spirit of Truth, will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak. He will glorify Me, because He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:13, 14</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that 
'the Paraclete' is the Holy Spirit is stated in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:26</a>. </p>

`Et [Ego] ero cum ore tuo, et docebo te quae loqueris': quod significet Divinum in omnibus et singulis quae a Divino Humano procedunt, constat ex significatione `esse cum ore' cum a Jehovah dicitur, 
quod sit esse cum illis quae enuntiat; quod per `os' significetur enuntiatio, videatur supra n. 6987, 6988; et quia ea dicuntur ad Moschen, per quem repraesentatur Dominus quoad legem Divinam in Divino 
Humano, per `ero cum ore tuo' significatur Divinum in illis quae a Divino Humano procedunt; et ex significatione `docere te quae loqueris' quod sit procedere; per `docere' enim et per `loqui' significatur 
influere, {1}et cum praedicatur de Divino Domini, est procedere; ab Ipso enim Divino Humano Domini procedit Divinum Verum, quod vocatur Spiritus Sanctus; et quia Dominus cum in mundo {2}fuit, 
fuit Ipse Divinum Verum, docuit Ipse {3} quae amoris et fidei erant, et tunc non per Spiritum Sanctum, ut Ipse {4}docet apud Johannem, Nondum erat Spiritus Sanctus, quia Jesus nondum glorificatus erat, 
vii 39; </p>
<p>at postquam Dominus etiam quoad Humanum factus est Jehovah, {5}hoc est, Divinum Bonum, quod fuit post resurrectionem, tunc non amplius fuit Divinum Verum, sed hoc a Divino Bono Ipsius processit; 
quod Spiritus Sanctus sit Divinum Verum quod a Divino Humano Domini procedit, et non aliquis spiritus aut aliqui spiritus ab aeterno, manifeste patet a Domini verbis in loco citato, quod nempe 
`nondum erat Spiritus Sanctus'; tum quod {6}ipse spiritus non possit procedere, sed sanctum spiritus, hoc est, sanctum quod procedit a Domino, et spiritus eloquitur; videatur etiam n. 6788. 	2 Ex his 
nunc sequitur quod in Domino omne Trinum sit perfectum, nempe Pater, Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus, et sic quod unus Deus sit, non autem tres, qui quoad personas distincti unum Divinum dicuntur constituere. 
 Quod in Verbo dictum sit Pater, Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus {7}, fuit ut agnoscerent Dominum et quoque Divinum in Ipso; homo enim in tanta caligine fuit, sicut etiam hodie est, ut aliter non (x)agnovisset 
aliquod Divinum in Humano Domini, nam hoc illi, quia prorsus incomprehensibile, fuisset supra omnem fidem; et praeterea veritas est quod sit Trinum, sed in uno, nempe in Domino; et quoque 
in Christianis Ecclesiis agnoscitur quod {8}Trinum in Ipso habitet perfecte; docuit etiam Dominus aperte quod Ipse `cum Patre unum esset,' Joh. xiv 9-12, {9} et quod sanctum, quod Spiritus Sanctus loquitur, 
non sit {10}illius, sed Domini, apud Johannem, Paracletus, Spiritus veritatis, non loquetur a seipso, sed quaecumque audiverit, loquetur: Ille Me glorificabit, quia ex Meo accipiet, et annuntiabit 
vobis, xvi 13, 14; </p>
