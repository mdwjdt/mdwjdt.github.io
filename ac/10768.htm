<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10768节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中的第五个星球-续<br /><strong>10768</strong>.除了前面所提到的外，在这个星球本身上面还看到了一些其它东西。这一切是通过我与那里的天使接触实现的，他们显现为这个星球上的人。因为当这些天使以前面所提到的方式显现为人时，他们就用自己的眼睛看见那里的物体，和那里的居民一样。但他们不处于这种状态时，根本看不见这类物体，只看到天堂里的事物。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE FIFTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. In addition to what has been related, some things were also seen on that earth itself, which was effected by communication with the angels who 
were there, and who appeared as men of the earth. For when these angels are presented to view as men in the manner above related, they see with their eyes the objects there exactly as do the inhabitants. 
But when they are not in this state, they see nothing of the kind, but only what is in heaven. </p>

THE FIFTH PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>In addition to what has already been mentioned some other things were also seen on the planet itself. This was brought about by my contact with the angels 
who were there and appeared as people belonging to the planet. For when they are manifested as people in the way that has been stated above they see objects there with their eyes exactly as its inhabitants 
do. But when they are not in that state they see no such objects at all, only things in heaven.  </p>

Continuatio de Quinta Tellure in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Praeter illa quae dicta sunt, etiam visa sunt aliqua in ipsa illa tellure, quod factum est per communicationem cum angelis qui ibi erant et apparebant 
{1}sicut homines telluris, nam illi, cum eo modo quo supra dictum est sistantur ut homines, oculis suis vident objecta ibi prorsus sicut incolae; at cum non in illo statu sunt, tunc nihil tale vident, 
sed modo quae in caelo. @1 ut$ </p>
