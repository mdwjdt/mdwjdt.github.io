<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1412节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1412.</strong>“本族”表更为外在的肉体和世俗之物，“父家”表更为内在的此类事物。这从“本族”和“父家”的含义可以看出来。人里面有肉体和世俗之物，其中有些更为外在，有些则更为内在。更为外在的，是那些属乎肉体之物，诸如肉体欢娱和感官知觉；而更为内在的，则是情感和记忆的知识。“本族”和“父家”所表示的，正是这些事物。圣言中有很多经文可以证实所表示的是这些事物。不过，由于这个问题可从语境和在内义上对所发生事件的洞悉明显看出来，故没有必要详加证实。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1412.</strong> And from your birth [place] symbolizes bodily and worldly concerns that were relatively superficial, while and from your father's house symbolizes ones that were deeper. This can be seen from the symbolism of birth and from that of a father's house.<br />We concern ourselves with our body and the world on shallower and deeper levels. Shallower matters really do belong to the body; they are physical pleasures and sensory experiences. The deeper ones are emotions and factual knowledge. These are the things symbolized by Abram's birth and by his father's house. Much evidence can confirm the claim that this is the symbolism, but since it can be seen from the series of ideas and from an examination of the subjects dealt with on an inner level, there is no need to spend time proving it. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1412</b></p><p><b>1412.</b>
And from thy birth. That this signifies the more exterior corporeal and worldly things, and that "from thy father's house" signifies the more interior of such things, may be seen from the signification 
of "birth," and from the signification of a "father's house." There are in man corporeal and worldly things more exterior and more interior; the more exterior are those which are proper to the body, 
such as pleasures and the things of sense; the more internal are affections and things of memory-knowledge; and these are what are signified by "birth" and a "father's house." That these are their significations 
may be confirmed by many passages of the Word, but as it is evident from the connection, and from looking at the things in the internal sense, there is no need to dwell on the confirmation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1412</b></p><p><b>1412.</b>
'From the place of your nativity' means bodily and worldly things that were more exterior, and 'from your father's house' means such as were more interior. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'nativity' 
and from the meaning of 'father's house'. There are in man bodily and worldly things, some of which are more exterior, others more interior. The more exterior are those which belong properly to 
the body, such as physical pleasures and sensory perceptions, while the interior are affections and factual knowledge. It is these that are meant by 'nativity' and by 'father's house'. That these things 
are meant may be confirmed from many places, but as the matter is clear from the context in which they belong and from an insight into what occurs in the internal sense there is no need to pause and 
confirm them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1412</b>
</p><b>1412.</b>
Quod 'e nativitate tua' significet corporea et mundana exteriora et quod 'e domo patris tui' significet talia interiora, constare potest a significatione 'nativitatis' et a significatione 'domus patris': 
sunt apud hominem corporea et mundana exteriora et interiora, exteriora sunt illa quae propria sunt corporis, ut voluptates et sensualia; interiora sunt affectiones et scientifica; haec sunt quae 
significantur per 'nativitatem' et per 'domum patris'; quod haec significentur, pluribus confirmari potest, sed quia constat ex serie et rerum intuitione in sensu interno, illis confirmandis non immorandum. </p>
