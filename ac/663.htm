<p><strong>[NCE]663.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_663/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_18" target=_top>Genesis 6:18</a>. "And I will set up my pact with you; and you will enter the ark: you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you."<br />Setting up a pact means that [the people referred to as Noah] would be reborn. That he was to enter the ark, as were his sons [and his wife] and his sons' wives means that they would be saved. The sons are truth and the wives goodness. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 663</b></p><p><b>663.</b>
Verse 18. And I will set up My covenant with thee; and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. To "set up a covenant" signifies that he would be 
regenerated; that "he, and his sons, and his sons' wives" should "come into the ark" signifies that he would be saved. "Sons" are truths; "wives" are goods. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 663</b></p><p><b>663.</b>
Verse 18 And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 'Establishing a covenant' means that he would be 
regenerated. 'He was to enter into the ark, he and his sons, [and his wife,] and his sons' wives' means that he would be saved, sons' being truths and 'wives' goods. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 663</b>
</p><b>663.</b>
Vers. 18.  Et erigam foedus Meum tecum; et intrabis in arcam tu, et filii tui, et uxor tua, et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum. 'Erigere foedus' significat quod regeneraretur: 'quod is intraret in arcam, 
et filii ejus, et uxores filiorum ejus' significat quod salvaretur; 'filii' sunt vera, 'uxores' sunt bona. </p>
