<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6419节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6419.</strong>“女儿啊，她爬到墙上”表出去与虚假争战。这从“女儿”和“爬到墙上”的含义清楚可知：“女儿”是指教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>节），在此是指属灵教会，因为该教会是此处所论述的主题；“爬到墙上”是指出去与虚假争战，这从接下来的话明显可知：“弓箭手苦害他，向他射箭，仇恨他。约瑟要坐在他弓的力量里”，以此表示虚假与真理的争战。<br />经上之所以说“爬到墙上”，是因为就内义而言，所论述的主题是虚假向真理发起的攻击，以及真理抵挡虚假的保护；事实上，“约瑟”所代表的属灵教会不断受到攻击，但主不断保护它。这解释了为何在圣言中，属该教会的一切都被比作一座城，这城有墙、外郭、城门和门闩；向该城所发起的攻击描述了虚假向真理所发起的攻击。也正因如此，“城”表示教义事物（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节），“城墙”表示用来保卫它的信之真理，在反面意义上则表示用来摧毁的虚假。“墙”表示用来保卫的信之真理，这一点可见于以赛亚书：<br />我们有坚固的城。耶和华要将救恩定为城墙、为外郭。敞开城门，使守信的义族得以进入。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.1.htm">26:1</a>）<br /><br />你必称你的墙为拯救，称你的门为赞美。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.18.htm">60:18</a>）<br /><br />看哪！我将你铭刻在我上；你的墙垣常在我面前。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.16.htm">49:16</a>）<br />“墙”表示信之真理。<br />耶路撒冷啊，我在你城墙上设立守望者，他们终日终夜必不静默，不停呼吁耶和华。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.6.htm">62:6</a>）<br />此处意思也一样。耶利米书：<br />万军之耶和华如此说，我要使你们在城墙外与围困你们的巴比伦王打仗所用的战器转回来。我要用伸出来的手亲自攻击你们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶21.4.htm">21:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶21.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />耶和华定意拆毁锡安女子的城墙；祂使外郭和城墙悲哀；一同衰败。她的门，都陷入地内；主将她的门闩毁坏折断。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.8.htm">2:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.9.htm">9</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />亚发人和你的军队都在你四围的墙上，你的塔楼也有歌玛底人。他们将盾牌悬挂在你四围的墙上，使你的美丽完全。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.11.htm">27:11</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗表示良善与真理的认知或知识。<br />“城”和“城墙”表示这类事物，这一点从对约翰所看见的从天而降的圣耶路撒冷的描述非常明显地看出来。从这段描述的每个细节明显可知，该城表示一个新教会；它的“城墙”表示从主发出的神性真理。启示录对此城的描述如下：<br />从天而降的圣耶路撒冷有高大的墙，有十二个门。城墙有十二根基，根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字。对我说话的，要量那城和城门、城墙。城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。墙的构造是碧玉的，城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃。城墙的根基是用各样宝石修饰的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">21:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“城墙”是指从主发出的神性真理，由此表示出于仁之良善的信之真理。这一事实从这段描述中所提到的关于“城墙”的每个细节明显看出来，如：“城墙有十二根基，根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字”，因为“十二”表示全部（参看<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>节）；“城墙”及其“根基”表示信之真理，“十二使徒”所表相同（<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）；以及“城墙共有一百四十四肘”，“一百四十四”这个数字与“十二”所表相同，即都表示全部，因为它是十二与十二的乘积。由于这个数字在论及城墙时表示信的全部真理与良善，故经上补充说“城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸”；还有其它细节，即“墙的构造是碧玉的，城墙的根基是用各样宝石修饰的”，因为“碧玉”和“宝石”表示信之真理（<a href="114.htm">114</a>节）。<br />“墙或城墙”在反面意义上表示用来毁灭的虚假，这层含义从以下经文明显看出来：<br />异象谷有溃乱的日子；。主万军之耶和华拆毁城墙，呼声达到山上；以拦带着箭袋，还有坐战车的人和马兵；也有马兵在城门前排列。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.5.htm">22:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.7.htm">7</a>）<br /><br />耶和华使你城墙上的避难堡垒倾倒下陷，落在地上，直到尘埃。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.12.htm">25:12</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />你们要上她的墙，加以推翻。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.10.htm">5:10</a>）<br /><br />我必在大马色城墙上使火着起，烧灭便哈达的宫殿。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.27.htm">49:27</a>）<br /><br />你们要竖立大旗，攻击巴比伦的城墙，加强守望，派立守望人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.12.htm">51:12</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />他们必破坏推罗的墙垣，拆毁她的塔楼。我也要刮净她的尘土，使她成为净光的磐石。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.4.htm">26:4</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6419</b></p><p><b>6419.</b>
Of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall. That this signifies for fighting against falsity, is evident from the signification of a "daughter," as being the church (see n. 2362, 3963); here the spiritual 
church, because this is the subject here treated of; and from the signification of "marching upon the wall," as being for fighting against falsity, as is plain from what follows: "the archers embitter 
him, and shoot at him, and hate him, and he shall sit in the strength of his bow," whereby is signified the fighting of falsity against truth. [2] "To march upon the wall" is said because in the 
internal sense the subject treated of is assault on truth by falsities, and defense of truth against falsity; for the spiritual church, which is represented by Joseph, is continually being assaulted, 
but the Lord continually defends it. Hence in the Word what belongs to this church is compared to a city, which has a wall, outworks, gates, and bars; and by the assaults on that city are described 
the assaults on truth by falsities; hence also a "city" signifies doctrinal things (n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493), and its "wall" the truths of faith which defend it, and in the opposite 
sense the falsities which are being destroyed. That a "wall" signifies the truths of faith which defend, is plain in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     We have a strong city; salvation will He appoint for walls and 
bulwark. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faithfulnesses may enter in (Isa. 26:1). Again: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise (Isa. 60:18). Again: </p>
<p> 
    Behold I have graven thee upon the hands, thy walls are continually before Me (Isa. 49:16); </p>
<p>"walls" denote the truths of faith. Again: </p>
<p>     I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; 
they shall not be silent all the day and the night, keeping Jehovah in mind (Isa. 62:6); </p>
<p>where the sense is the same. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah Zebaoth, I will turn back the weapons of war 
wherewith ye fight with the king of Babylon, besieging you without the wall. I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand (Jer. 21:4, 5). Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath purposed to destroy 
the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together. Her gates have sunk into the earth; He hath destroyed and broken her bars (Lam. 2:8, 9). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    The sons of Arvad and thine army were upon thy walls round about; and the Gammadim were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about, they have perfected thy beauty (Ezek. 
27:11); </p>
<p>speaking of Tyre, by which are signified the knowledges of good and truth. [3] That such things are signified by a "city" and "walls," is very evident from the description of the holy 
Jerusalem coming down out of heaven, which was seen by John. That a new church is signified thereby is plain from all the details; and by the "wall" thereof, the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. 
It is written of this in John: </p>
<p>     The holy Jerusalem coming down from heaven, having a wall great and high; having twelve gates. The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names 
of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. He that spake with me measured the city and its gates, and the wall thereof. The wall thereof was a hundred forty and four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that 
is, of an angel. The building of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone (Rev. 21:10-19); 
 [4] that the "wall" is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and hence the truth of faith from the good of charity, is plain from everything said about the wall, that it "had twelve foundations 
and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb," for by "twelve" are signified all (see n. 3272, 3858, 3913); by the "wall" and its "foundations," the truths of faith, in like manner as 
by the "twelve apostles" (n. 3488, 3858, 6397); also that the "wall was one hundred and forty-four cubits," for by this number the like is signified as by "twelve," namely all, for it is twelve multiplied 
into twelve, and because this number when applied to a wall signifies all the truths and goods of faith, it is added that it is the "measure of a man, that is, of an angel;" and also that the "building 
of the wall was jasper, and its foundations were adorned with every precious stone," for by "jasper" and "precious stones" are signified the truths of faith (n. 114). [5] That in the opposite 
sense a "wall" signifies falsities which are being destroyed, is plain from the following: </p>
<p>     A day of tumult in the valley of vision; the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth destroyeth the wall, and there is a shout 
toward the mountain; for Elam hath borne the quiver, with chariot of man, with horsemen, the horsemen placing have placed themselves even at the gate (Isa. 22:5-7). Again: </p>
<p>     The fortress of 
the refuge of thy walls shall He depress, cast down, throw to the earth, even to the dust (Isa. 25:12).  In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Go ye up on her walls, and cast down (Jer. 5:10). Again: </p>
<p>     I will kindle 
a fire in the wall of Damascus which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad (Jer. 49:27). Again: </p>
<p>     Lift up a standard against the walls of Babylon, keep the watch, set the watchmen (Jer. 51:12). In 
Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     They shall overthrow the walls of Tyre, and destroy her towers; and I will scrape her dust from her, and make her the dryness of a rock (Ezek. 26:4). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6419</b></p><p><b>6419.</b>
'Daughters, [each one] marches onto the wall' means going out to fight against falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'a daughter' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>, here the spiritual Church 
since that Church is the subject; and from the meaning of 'marching onto the wall' as going out to fight against falsity, as is evident from the words that immediately follow - 'they exasperate him 
and shoot at him and hate him, do the archers; and he will sit in the strength of his bow', meaning the fight put up by falsity against truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression 'marches onto the wall' is used because 
the subject in the internal sense is the attack made by falsities on truth and the protection of truth against falsity; for the spiritual Church represented by 'Joseph' is constantly under attack, 
but the Lord is constantly protecting it. This explains why in the Word all that makes up that Church is compared to a city with a wall, rampart, gates, and bars; and attacks made on the city describe 
attacks made on truth by falsities. Hence it also is that 'a city' means matters of doctrine, <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4492.htm">4492</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, and 'a wall' the truths of faith that serve to defend, 
or in the contrary sense falsities that serve to destroy. The first meaning - the truths of faith that serve to defend - may be seen in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Ours is a strong city; He will establish salvation for 
walls and rampart. Open the gates, so that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2026:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 26:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I have engraved you upon [My] hands, your walls are continually before Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:16</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'Walls' stands for the truths of faith. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Upon 
your walls, O Jerusalem, I have placed watchmen, all day and night they will not be silent, calling Jehovah to mind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2062:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 62:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, the 
God of Israel,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I will convert the weapons of war with which you are fighting with the king of Babel, besieging you outside the wall; I Myself will fight with you with an outstretched hand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2021:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 21:4</a>, 
<a href="5.htm">5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah thought to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion, He caused rampart and wall to mourn; they will languish together. Her gates have sunk into the earth, He has 
destroyed and broken in pieces her bars. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The sons of Arvad, and your army, were on your walls round about, and the Gammadim were in your towers; they hung their shields 
on your walls round about and they made perfect your beauty. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means cognitions of good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that such things are meant by a city and 
its walls becomes perfectly clear from the description of the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven, as seen by John. From every detail of the description it is evident that a new Church is meant by 
that city; and by its wall is meant Divine Truth going forth from the Lord. The city is depicted in John as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
The holy Jerusalem coming down from heaven, having a wall great and high, having 
twelve gates - the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. He who talked to me measured the city and its gates, and its wall. Its wall was 
a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. The structure of the wall was jasper, and the city pure gold, like pure glass. The foundations of the wall of the 
city were adorned with every precious stone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:10,%2012,%2014,%2015,%2017-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:10, 12, 14, 15, 17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that 'the wall' means Divine Truth going forth from the Lord, and from this means the truth of faith coming 
out of the good of charity, is evident from the details regarding the wall that are mentioned in that description, such as the detail that the wall had twelve foundations, and in them were the names 
of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; for 'twelve means all, <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, and 'the wall and its foundations' the truths of faith - much the same as is meant by 'the twelve apostles', <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a> (end), 
<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. Then there is the detail that the wall was a hundred and forty-four cubits high, much the same being meant by that number as by twelve, which is all, since it is the product of twelve multiplied 
by twelve. And since that number used in reference to the wall means all truths and goods of faith, the expression 'which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel' is added. Other details that 
are given are that the structure of the wall was jasper, and that its foundations were adorned with every precious stone; for 'jasper' and 'precious stones' mean the truths of faith, <a href="114.htm">114</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The 
meaning of 'wall' in the contrary sense - falsities that serve to destroy -is evident from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<p>A day of tumult in the valley of vision. The Lord Jehovih Zebaoth has destroyed 
the wall, so that there is a shout towards the mountain. For Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men (homo), [and] horsemen. The horsemen surely positioned themselves right at the gate. Isa. 
22:57. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The defence-work of your walls providing refuge<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> He will pull down, cast down, lay flat on the ground,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> right down into the dust. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2025:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 25:12</a>.

<p>apud eundem, Cogitavit Jehovah perdere murum filiae Zionis, . . . lugere  fecit promurale et murum, simul languent; subsiderunt in terram  portae ejus, perdidit et confregit vectes ejus, Thren. 
ii 8,9:  apud Ezechielem, Filii Arvadi et exercitus tuus super muris tuis circumcirca;  et Gammadaei in turribus tuis fuerunt, scuta sua suspenderunt  super muris tuis circumcirca, et perfecerunt 
pulchritudinem tuam,  xxvii{2}11; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro, per quam significantur cognitiones boni et veri. [3] Quod talia per `urbem et muros significentur, constare potest manifeste ex descriptione sanctae Hierosolymae 
descendentis e caelo, visae Johanni, per quam quod nova Ecclesia significetur, a singulis patet, et per `murum' ibi Divinum Verum procedens a Domino; de illa {3}ita apud Johannem, Sancta Hierosolyma 
descendens de caelo, . . . habens murum  magnum et altum, habens portas duodecim;... murus urbis habebat  fundamenta duodecim, et in illis nomina duodecim apostolorum  Agni: qui mecum loquebatur, 
. . . metiebatur urbem et portas  ejus, et murum ejus; .  . murus ejus erat centum quadraginta et  quatuor cubitorum, quae est mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli;  erat structura muri jaspis, et urbs 
aurum purum, similis vitro  puro; fundamenta muri urbis omni lapide pretioso exornata,  Apoc. xxi 10, (x)12, 14, 15, 17-19; </p>
<p>[4]quod `murus' sit Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, et inde verum fidei 
ex bono charitatis, patet a singulis quae de muro ibi dicuntur, ut quod `murus haberet fundamenta duodecim', et `in illis nomina duodecim apostolorum Agni'; per `duodecim' enim significantur omnia, 
n. 3272, 3858,3913, per `murum et ejus fundamenta' vera fidei,{4}similiter ac per duodecim apostolos, n. 3488, 3858 fin., 6397:  tum quod `murus esset centum quadraginta et quatuor cubitorum', per illum 
numerum enim simile significatur quod per `duodecim', nempe omnia; nam compositus est ex duodecim multiplicatis in duodecim, et quia numerus ille, cum dicitur de muro, significat omnia vera et bona 
fidei, {5}additur quod `ille sit mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli';et quoque quod `structura muri esset jaspis, et fundamenta ejus omni lapide pretioso exornata', per `jaspidem' enim et per `lapides 
pretiosos' significantur vera fidei, n. 114.  [5] Quod `murus' in opposito sensu significet falsa quae destruuntur, patet ab his locis: apud Esaiam, Dies tumultus .  . in valle visionis; Dominus Jehovih 
 Zebaoth destruit murum, ut vociferatio versus montem; nam Elam  sustulit pharetram cum curru hominis, equitibus, . . . equites  ponendo posuerunt usque ad portam, xxii 5-7: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Munimentum 
refugii murorum tuorum deprimet, dejiciet,  prosternet in terram, usque in pulverem, xxv 12: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,  Ascendite in muros ejus, et dejicite, v 10: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Accendam ignem in {6}murum 
Damasci, qui comedet palatia Benhadadi, x1ix 27: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Contra muros Babelis tollite signum, tenete custodiam constituite custodes, li 12: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, Evertent muros Tyri, et destruent 
turres ejus, et detraham pulverem ejus ab illa, (c)et dabo illam ariditatem petrae, xxvi 4,8,9, 12. @1 i de$ @2 I o 11$ @3 i enim$ @4 pariter$ @5 dicitur$ @6 muro$ </p>
