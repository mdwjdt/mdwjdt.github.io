<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5779节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5779.</strong>“约瑟对他们说”表他们此时的觉知。这从“说”的含义清楚可知，“说”是指觉知。它之所以表示觉知，是因为说话的是约瑟，而约瑟代表内在；而一切觉知皆来自内在，也就是从主经由内在而来。觉知，甚至感觉并非来自其它源头。表面上看，感觉，以及觉知好像通过流注从外在而来。但这是一个错误观念，因为是内在通过外在在感觉。位于身体中的感官无非是器皿或工具，用来服务于内在人，好使它能感觉到世上的东西。因此，内在流入外在，使它去感觉，好叫它能由此感知事物，变得更完美。但外在无法流入内在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5779</b></p><p><b>5779.</b>
And Joseph said unto them. That this signifies their perception then, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception. That it is their perception, is because it is said by Joseph, 
and by Joseph is represented the internal; and from the internal, that is, through the internal from the Lord, comes all perception. From no other source does perception come, nor even sensation. It 
appears as if sensation, as also perception, come by influx from the external; but this is a fallacy, for it is the internal that feels through the external. The senses placed in the body are nothing 
but organs or instruments that are of service to the internal man in order that it may be sensible of what is in the world; wherefore the internal flows into the external, causing it to feel, to the end 
that it may thereby perceive and be perfected; but not the reverse. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5779</b></p><p><b>5779.</b>
'And Joseph said to them' means their perception at this point. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perception. The reason why it means their perception is that Joseph, the one who is the speaker, 
represents the internal, and it is from the internal, that is, from the Lord by way of the internal, that all perception comes. No perception comes from anywhere else, not even sensation. The 
appearance is that sensation as well as discernment come about as a result of influx from the external; but this is a mistaken idea. For it is the internal that experiences sensation, through the external. 
The senses located in the body are no more than organs or instruments to serve the internal man, enabling it to receive sensory impressions of things in the world. The internal therefore flows into 
the external in order to receive sensory impressions, to the end that it may thereby discern things and become more perfect. But the external cannot flow into the internal.  </p>

`Et dixit ad illos Joseph': quod significet perceptionem runc illorum, constat a significatione `dicere' quod sit perceptio; quod sit perceptio illorum, est quia `Joseph' dicit, et per `Josephum' repraesentatur 
internum, et ab interno, hoc est, per internum a Domino venit omnis perceptio, aliunde nusquam venit, ne quidem sensatio; apparet quod sensatio ut et apperceptio {1}veniant (c)ex influxu 
ab externo, sed est fallacia; internum enim est quod {2}sentit per externum, sensus in corpore positi non sunt nisi quam organa seu instrumenta inservientia interno homini, ut is {3}sentiat quae in mundo, 
quapropter influit internum in externum ut sentiat, ob finem ut inde appercipiat et perficiatur; {4}non autem vice versa. @1 veniret$ @2 videt$ @3 videat$ @4 A d$ </p>
