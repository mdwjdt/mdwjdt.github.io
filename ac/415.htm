<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>415.</strong>“牲畜之父”表源于爱的神圣事物的良善，这一点从本章第2节所示明显可知，该节表明，“牧羊的”表仁之善。然而，这里的“父”用来取代“牧人”，“牲畜”用来取代“羊群”。雅八被说成是“牲畜”之“父”，“牲畜”一词紧随“帐棚”之后，由此明显可知，它表出自爱的神圣事物的良善。不管理解成住处，即圈舍，还是理解成住帐棚与圈舍者之父，这些说法都表源于爱的属天事物的良善，这一点从圣言的各个部分清楚可知。如：“我要将我羊群中所余剩的，从我赶他们到的各地，招聚出来，领他们归回本圈，他们也必繁殖增多。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.3.htm">23:3</a>） “我必在美好的草场牧养他们；他们的圈必在以色列高处的山上。他们必在佳美之圈中躺卧，也在以色列山肥美的草场吃草。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.14.htm">34:14</a>）这里的“圈”和“草场”被称为“肥美”，表爱之善。<br />“你将种子撒在地里，主必降雨在其上，并使地所出的粮肥美流油。到那时，祂要在宽阔的草场放牧你的牲畜。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.23.htm">30:23</a>）“粮”表属天之物，放牧牲畜之地的“肥美”表源于属天之物的良善。<br />“因耶和华救赎了雅各，他们要来到锡安的高处歌唱，又流归耶和华的美物，就是有小麦、新酒和油，并羊羔、牛犊之地。他们的心灵必象浇灌的园子。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.11.htm">31:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.12.htm">12</a>）耶和华的神圣在此用“小麦”和“油”来描述，源于它的良善则用“新酒”、“羊羔和牛犊”或“牲畜的幼崽”来描述。<br />“牧人必引他们的羊群来到锡安的女儿那里，在她周围支搭帐棚，各在自己的地方，使羊吃草。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.3.htm">6:3</a>）“锡安的女儿”表属天教会，“帐棚”和“羊群”与之相关。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]415.</strong> The symbolism of the father of livestock as the good actions resulting from holy love can be seen from what was shown above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_2" target=_top>2</a> of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_343" target=_top>343-344</a>]: that the shepherd of the flock symbolizes the good actions that charity inspires. The present verse, though, mentions a father rather than a shepherd, and livestock rather than a flock; and the expression of livestock (dependent on father) directly follows the word tent. This shows that the phrase means good actions coming from holy love.{*1} A home or fold for the livestock is the idea; in other words, it is referring to the father of those that lived in tents and livestock pens.<br />Their symbolism as the goodness produced by heavenly love can also be seen throughout the Word, as in Jeremiah, for instance:<br />I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands to which I dispersed them, and I will bring them back to their folds, so that they may breed and multiply. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 23:3</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br />In a good pasture I will pasture them, and on the mountains of Israel's height will be their fold. There will they lie in a good fold, and on rich pasture they will graze in Israel's mountains. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_14" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:14</a>)<br />The folds and pastures stand for the goodness that love brings about, described as "rich."<br />[2] In Isaiah:<br />He will give rain for the seed with which you will sow the ground; and the bread, the produce of the ground, will be rich with fat and oil. He will pasture your livestock on that day in a broad meadow. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_23" target=_top>Isaiah 30:23</a>)<br />The bread symbolizes what is heavenly, and the richness on which the livestock will graze symbolizes the good actions that result from it. In Jeremiah:<br />Jehovah has ransomed Jacob; and they will come and sing on Zion's height and stream together toward the goodness Jehovah has bestowed on wheat and on new wine and on oil and on the offspring of flock and herd, and their soul will be like a watered garden. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_11-12" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:11-12</a>)<br />This depicts Jehovah's holiness as wheat and oil, the good actions coming from it as new wine and as offspring of flock and herd — livestock. In the same author:<br />Shepherds and the flocks of their livestock will come to the daughter of Zion. They will fix their tents near her all around. They will each graze their space. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_6_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 6:3</a>)<br />The daughter of Zion stands for a heavenly type of church, which is associated with both tents and flocks of livestock.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} What Swedenborg seems to be saying here (with reference to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_20" target=_top>Genesis 4:20</a>, "he was the father of the tent dweller, and of livestock") is that although the words "father" and "of livestock" are understood together, in the original text the word for "of livestock" actually stands next to the word for "tent," which implies that what the livestock symbolize (goodness) grows out of that which the tent symbolizes (holy love).

That by the "father of cattle" is signified the good that is derived from the holy things of love, is evident from what was shown above, at verse 2 of this chapter, where it was shown that a "shepherd 
of the flock" signifies the good of charity. Here however the term "father" is employed instead of "shepherd" and "cattle" instead of "flock;" and the word "cattle" of which Jabal is said to be the 
"father" follows immediately after "tent" whence it is evident that it signifies the good that comes from the holy of love, and that there is meant a habitation or fold for cattle, or the father of them 
that dwell in tents and in folds for cattle. And that these expressions signify goods from the celestial things of love, is evident from various passages in the Word. As in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will gather 
the remnants of My flock out of all lands whither I have scattered them, and I will bring them again to their folds, that they may be fruitful and multiply (Jer. 23:3). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will 
feed them in a good pasture, and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be; there shall they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel 
(Ezek. 34:14), where "folds" and "pastures" denote the goods of love, of which "fatness" is predicated. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He shall give the rain of thy seed wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; 
and bread of the increase of the ground shall be fat and full of oil; in that day shall He feed thy cattle in a broad meadow (Isa. 30:23), where by "bread" is signified what is celestial, and by the 
"fat" whereon the cattle should feed, the goods thence derived. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the good 
of Jehovah, for the wheat, and for the new wine, and for the oil, and for the sons of the flock, and of the herd; and their soul shall be as a watered garden (Jer. 31:11-12), where the Holy of Jehovah 
is described by "wheat" and "oil" and the goods derived from it by "new wine" and the "sons of the flock and of the herd" or of "cattle." Again: </p>
<p>     The shepherds and the flocks of their cattle shall 
come unto the daughter of Zion; they shall pitch their tents toward her round about; they shall feed everyone his own space (Jer. 6:3). The "daughter of Zion" denotes the celestial church, of which 
"tents" and "flocks of cattle" are predicated. </p>

'Father of cattle' means good deriving from these, that is, from the holy things of love. This becomes clear from what has been shown already at verse 2 of this chapter, to the effect that 'a shepherd 
of the flock' means good that stems from charity. In the present verse, however, 'father' is used instead of shepherd, and 'cattle' instead of flock, with the words 'and of cattle', whose father he 
was, standing immediately after the word 'tent', from which it is clear that good stemming from the holiness of love is meant. And whether the dwelling-place, which was 'a cattle-fold', or 'father of 
those who dwelt in tent and cattle-folds' is understood here, goods stemming from the celestial things of love are meant, as is also clear from various parts of the Word, as in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will gather 
the remnant of My flock from all lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their folds to give birth and multiply. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2013:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 13:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will pasture them in a good 
pasture, and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel; there they will lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture they will pasture on the mountains of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'folds' and 'pastures', referred to as 'fat', stand for goods that stem from love.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
He will give rain for your seed with which you will sow the ground; and bread, the produce of 
the ground, will be fat and full of it. On that day He will pasture your cattle in a broad grassland. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'bread' means that which is celestial, and 'fat on which they will pasture 
their flocks' goods stemming from that which is celestial. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has redeemed Jacob; and they will come and sing on the height of Zion, and they will converge on the goodness of Jehovah, 
for the wheat, and the new wine, and the oil, for the young<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the flock and of the herd. And their life<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will be like a watered garden. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:11, 12</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here the Holy of Jehovah is described 
by 'the wheat and oil', and goods deriving from it by 'the new wine and by the young' of the flock and of the herd', or cattle. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Shepherds and their flocks of cattle will come 
against the daughter of Zion, they will pitch their tents against her round about; they will pasture, each in his own space. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The daughter of Zion' stands for the celestial Church, to which 
both 'tents' and 'flocks of cattle' have reference.

Quod per 'patrem pecoris' significetur bonum inde seu ex sanctis amoris, constare potest ex illis quae prius ad vers. 2 hujus capitis ostensa sunt, quod 'pastor gregis' significet bonum charitatis; 
hic autem non pastor sed 'pater,' nec grex sed 'pecus,' nominatur; 'et pecoris,' cujus pater, immediate sequitur post tentorium; inde constat quod significet bonum quod venit ex sancto amoris, et intelligitur 
habitaculum, seu caula pecoris, seu pater eorum qui habitabant tentorium et caulas pecoris, quae quod bona ex caelestibus amoris significent, constat quoque passim ex Verbo; ut apud Jeremiam, 	Ego 
congregabo reliquias gregis Mei de omnibus terris, quo dispuli illos, et reducam eos ad caulas suas, ut 	fetificent, et multiplicentur, xxiii 3: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	In pascuo bono pascam eos, et 
in montibus altitudinis Israelis erit caula eorum, ibi cubabunt in caula bona, et pascuum pingue pascent ad montes Israelis, xxxiv 14; </p>
<p>ubi 'caulae et pascua' pro bonis amoris, de quo praedicatur 'pingue': 
 [2] apud Esaiam, 	Dabit pluviam seminis tui, quo seminabis humum; et panis, proventus humi, erit pinguis et oleosus, pascet pecora tua in die illo, prato lato, xxx 23; </p>
<p>ubi per 'panem' significatur 
caeleste, per 'pingue, quo pascent pecora' bona inde: apud Jeremiam, 	Redemit Jehovah Jacobum,... et venient, et canent in 	altitudine Zionis, et confluent ad bonum Jehovae, super triticum, et 
super mustum, et super oleum, et super filios 	gregis, et armenti, et erit anima eorum sicut hortus irriguus, 	xxxi 11, 12; </p>
<p>ubi sanctum Jehovae describitur per 'triticum et oleum'; et bona inde per 
'mustum, filios gregis et armenti,' seu pecoris: apud eundem, 	Ad filiam Zionis venient pastores et greges pecorum {1} eorum; figent ad illam tentoria circum circa, pascent quisque spatium suum, vi 
3; </p>
<p>'filia Zionis' pro Ecclesia caelesti, de qua praedicantur 'et tentoria, et greges pecorum.' @	1 Elsewhere S. has greges eorum only, which is as Heb.    ('eder) = flock (of sheep), while     (baqar) 
= herd (of oxen).$ </p>
