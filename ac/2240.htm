<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2240节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2240.</strong>“嚷叫声”表虚假，“罪恶”表邪恶。这从圣言中“嚷叫”（cry）的含义清楚可知。若不了解圣言的内义，谁也不知道“嚷叫”（cry）竟然表示虚假。这个词数次出现在先知书中，当那里论述荒废和荒凉时，经上就说人们“哀号和呼喊”（howl and cry），以此表示良善与真理已荒废。在这些地方，所用的这个词就内义而言，用来描述虚假。如耶利米书：<br />有牧人呼喊，有羊群领导者哀号的声音，因为耶和华使他们的草场变为荒场。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.36.htm">25:36</a>）<br />此处“牧人呼喊”表他们处于虚假，这虚假导致荒废。<br />同一先知书：<br />看哪，有水从北方发起，成为涨溢的河流，要涨过遍地和其中所有的，并城和其中所住的。人必呼喊，境内的居民都必哀号，因为荒废的日子将到。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.2.htm">47:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这论及由虚假所造成的信的荒凉；“涨溢的河流”是指虚假，如第一卷所示（<a href="705.htm">705</a>，<a href="790.htm">790</a>节）。<br />西番雅书：<br />从鱼门必发出呼叫的声音，从二区发出哀号的声音，从山间发出大破裂的响声。他们的财宝必成为掠物，他们的房屋必变为荒场。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.10.htm">1:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“呼叫”（cry）也论及荒废的虚假。<br />以赛亚书：<br />他们上鲁希坡随走随哭，因为宁林的水成为干涸，青草枯乾，嫩草灭没，青绿之物一无所有。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.5.htm">15:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.6.htm">6</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.3.htm">48:3</a>）<br />此处以“哭”（cry）来描述信的荒凉及其顶点。<br />耶利米书：<br />犹大悲哀，城门衰败，众人披上黑衣坐在地上，耶路撒冷的哀声上达。他们的贵胄打发家僮打水，他们来到水池，见没有水，就拿着空器皿回来了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.2.htm">14:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处“耶路撒冷的哀声（cry）”表虚假，因为“他们见没有水”表示缺乏对真理的认知，“水”就表示这类认知，如第一卷所示（<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>节）。<br />以赛亚书：<br />我必因耶路撒冷欢喜，因我的百姓快乐。其中必不再听见哭泣的声音和哀呼的声音。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.19.htm">65:19</a>）<br />此处“必不再听见哭泣的声音”表必没有邪恶，“也不再听见哀呼的声音”表必没有虚假。这些细节绝大部分无法通过字义来理解，只能通过内义来理解，这就是“哀呼”（cry）的情况。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华指望公平，看哪，却有流血；指望公义，看哪，却有冤声。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.7.htm">5:7</a>）<br />这也论及良善与真理的荒废。此处和先知书的各处一样，表达了一种互易，这种互易具有这样的性质：寻找真理时见到的是邪恶，由“取代公平的流血”来表示；寻找良善时见到的是虚假，由“取代公义的冤声”来表示。因为“公平”是指真理，“公义”是指良善，如前所示（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。<br />摩西五经中也有类似的互易，那里论到所多玛和蛾摩拉说：<br />他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，他们的葡萄是蛾摩拉田园所生的，是苦毒的葡萄，整串都是苦的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.32.htm">32:32</a>）<br />此处出现了同样的说法，因为“葡萄树”用来论及真理和虚假，“田园”和“葡萄”用来论及良善和邪恶，所以“所多玛的葡萄树”是指源于邪恶的虚假，“蛾摩拉的田园和葡萄”是指源于虚假的邪恶；虚假有两种（参看第一卷<a href="1212.htm">1212</a>节），故邪恶也有两种。这两种虚假和邪恶在本节以“所多玛和蛾摩拉嚷叫声很大，他们的罪恶极重”来表示，这从以下事实明显可知，经上首先提及“嚷叫声”，其次提及“罪恶”；首先提及“所多玛”，就是源于自我之爱的邪恶，其次提及“蛾摩拉”，就是源于那邪恶的虚假。</p>

That a "cry" denotes falsity, and "sin" evil, is evident from the signification in the Word of a "cry." That a "cry" signifies falsity, can be evident to no one unless he knows the internal sense of 
the Word. The word sometimes occurs in the Prophets, and when vastation and desolation are there treated of, it is said that men "howl and cry," by which is signified that goods and truths have been vastated; 
and a term is there made use of by which in the internal sense falsity is described; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the howling of the powerful ones of the flock 
because Jehovah layeth waste their pasture (Jer. 25:36), where the "cry of the shepherds" denotes that they are in falsity, from which there comes vastation.  [2] In the same: </p>
<p>Behold, waters rise 
up from the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and the fullness thereof, the city and them that dwell therein and the men shall cry, and every inhabitant of the 
land shall howl, because of the day that cometh to lay waste (Jer. 47:2, 4), where the desolation of faith is treated of, which is brought about by falsities; the "overflowing stream" is falsity (as 
shown in Part First, n. 705, 790).  [3] In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     The voice of a cry from the fish gate, and a howling from the second, and a great shattering from the hills, and their wealth shall become 
a spoil, and their houses a desolation (Zeph. 1:10, 13), where also a "cry" is predicated of the falsities which lay waste.  [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In the way of Horonaim they shall rouse up a cry 
of shattering, for the waters of Nimrim shall be desolations, for the grass has dried up, the herb is consumed, there is no green thing (Isa. 15:5, 6; Jer. 48:3), where the desolation of faith and its 
consummation is described by a "cry."  [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Judah hath mourned, and her gates languish, they have been blackened upon the earth, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up and their illustrious 
ones have sent their younger ones to the waters they came to the pits, they found no waters, they returned with their vessels empty (Jer. 14:2, 3), where the "cry of Jerusalem" denotes falsities 
for by their "finding no waters" is signified that there were no knowledges of truth, which are " waters" (as shown in Part First, n. 28, 680, 739).  [6] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will exult in Jerusalem 
and be glad in My people, and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying (Isa. 65:19), where there "not being heard the voice of weeping" `denotes that there shall not 
be evil; "nor the voice of crying" denotes that there shall not be falsity. Very many of these things cannot be understood from the sense of the letter, but only from the internal sense, and this is 
the case with a "cry."  [7] In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah looked for judgment, but behold a scab; for righteousness, but behold a cry (Jer. 5:7), where also the vastation of good and truth is treated 
of. There is in this passage a kind of reciprocation, such as is occasionally found in the Prophets, and which is of such a nature that in the place of truth there is found evil, which is meant by there 
being "a scab instead of judgment;" and falsity in place of good, which is meant by there being "a cry instead of righteousness" (for that "judgment" is truth, and "righteousness" good, was shown 
above, n. 2235). [8] There is a like reciprocation in Moses, where Sodom and Gomorrah are treated of: </p>
<p>     Of the vine of Sodom is their vine, and of the fields of Gomorrah are their grapes; they have 
grapes of gall, clusters of bitternesses. (Deut. 32:32), where there is a similar mode of speaking; for the "vine" is predicated of truths and falsities, and the "fields" and "grapes," of goods and 
evils; so that "the vine of Sodom" is falsity from evil, and "the fields and grapes of Gomorrah" are evils from falsities; for there are two kinds of falsity (see volume 1, n. 1212); and so also there 
are two kinds of evil. Both kinds of falsity and evil are signified in this verse by the "cry of Sodom and Gomorrah having become great, and their sin having become exceeding grievous;" as is evident 
from the fact that "cry" is named in the first place, and "sin" in the second; and yet  "Sodom," which is evil from the love of self, is mentioned first; and  "Gomorrah," which is the derivative falsity, second. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2240</b></p><p><b>2240.</b>
That 'cry' is falsity, and 'sin' evil, becomes clear from the meaning of 'cry' in the Word. The meaning of 'cry' as falsity is not seen by anyone unless he knows the internal sense of the Word. The expression 
occurs several times in the Prophets, and when vastation and desolation are the subject in those places it is said that men 'wail and cry out', meaning that goods and truths have been laid waste. 
In those places a word is used by which in the internal sense falsity is described, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wail of the powerful ones of the flock, for 
Jehovah is laying waste their pasture. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25: 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the cry of the shepherds' means that they are subject to falsity, which leads to vastation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, waters rising 
out of the north, they will be a deluging stream, and they will deluge the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it, and men will cry out and every inhabitant of the land will 
wail, on the day that is coming to lay waste. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2047:%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 47: 2, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the desolation of faith which is effected by falsities. 'A deluging stream' is falsity, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="705.htm">705</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a loud crash from the hills. And their wealth will be for plunder, and their houses for 
desolation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%201:%2010,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 1: 10, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'a cry' has reference to falsities that lay waste.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On the road to Horonaim they will raise a cry of ruination, for the waters of Nimrim 
will be desolations, because the grass has withered, herbage is at an end, there are no plants. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2015:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 15: 5, 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48: 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the desolation of faith is meant, and the climax is described by 'a 
cry'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Judah mourned and her gates languished; the people were in black down to the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem went up. And their illustrious ones sent their lesser ones to 
the waters; they came to the pits, they found no water, they returned with their vessels empty. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14: 2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the cry of Jerusalem' stands for falsities, for their finding no water means lack 
of cognitions of truth - 'water' meaning such cognitions, as has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; and no more will 
there be heard in it the voice of weeping nor the voice of a cry. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65: 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'there will not be heard the voice of weeping' means that there will be no evil, 'nor the voice of a cry' that 
there will be no falsity. The majority of these details cannot be understood, nor thus what is meant by 'a cry', from the sense of the letter, but from the internal sense.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
looked for judgement, but behold, rottenness; for righteousness, but behold, a cry. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also is referring to the vastation of good and truth. Here, as also in various places 
in the Prophets, a kind of reciprocity is expressed, which is such that one finds evil in place of truth, meant by 'rottenness' instead of 'judgement', and falsity in place of good, meant by 'a cry' 
instead of 'righteousness'; for by 'judgement' is meant truth and by 'righteousness' good, as shown above in <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 A similar reciprocity is expressed in Moses when Sodom and Gomorrah are referred 
to, </p>
<blockquote>
From the vine of Sodom comes their vine, and from the fields of Gomorrah their grapes; they have grapes of poison and clusters of bitterness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32: 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here a similar manner of expression 
occurs, for 'the vine' is used in reference to truths and to falsities, 'fields and grapes' to goods and to evils, so that 'the vine of Sodom' means falsity derived from evil, and 'fields and grapes 
of Gomorrah' evils derived from falsities. For there are two kinds of falsity, dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="1212.htm">1212</a>, and so also there are two kinds of evil. Both kinds of falsity and evil are meant 
in this verse by 'the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has become great, and their sin has become extremely grave', as is clear from the fact that 'cry' is mentioned first and 'sin' second, and 'Sodom', which 
is evil springing from self-love, is referred to first, and 'Gomorrah', which is falsity derived from that evil, is referred to second. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2240</b>
</p><b>2240.</b>
Quod `clamor' sit falsum, et `peccatum' sit malum, constare potest a significatione `clamoris' in Verbo; quod `clamor' falsum significet, nemini constare potest nisi internum sensum Verbi sciat; aliquoties 
occurrit apud Prophetas, et ibi cum agitur de vastatione et desolatione, dicitur quod `ejulent et clament,' et significat quod bona et vera vastata sint, estque ibi vox per quam in sensu interno 
describitur falsum, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Vox clamoris pastorum, et ejulatus potentum gregis, quia vastans Jehovah pascuum eorum, xxv 36; </p>
<p>[2] ubi `clamor pastorum' est quod sint in falso, ex quo vastatio: 
apud eundem, 	Ecce aquae ascendentes a septentrione, et erunt in flumen inundans, et inundabunt terram et plenitudinem ejus, urbem et habitantes in ea, et clamabunt homo {1} et ejulabit omnis 
habitator terrae,... super diem venientem ad vastandum, xlvii 2, 4; </p>
<p>ubi agitur de desolatione fidei quae fit per falsa; `flumen inundans' est falsum, ut in Parte Prima (t)ostensum n. 705, 790: [3] apud 
Zephaniam, 	Vox clamoris a porta piscium, et ejulatio a secundaria, et confractio magna a collibus, et erant opes eorum in 	direptionem, et domus eorum in desolationem, i 10, 13; </p>
<p>ubi etiam `clamor' 
praedicatur de falsis quae vastant: [4] apud Esaiam, 	Via Horonaim clamorem confractionis excitabunt, quia aquae Nimrim desolationes erunt, quoniam aruit gramen, consummata est verba, olus non est, 
xv 5, 6; Jer. xlviii 3; </p>
<p>ibi desolatio fidei, et consummatio describitur per clamorem: [5] apud Jeremiam, 	Luxit Jehudah, et portae ejus languescentes factae, atrati sunt in terram, et clamor Hierosolymae 
ascendit; et illustres eorum miserunt minores suos ad aquas, venerunt ad foveas, non invenerunt aquas, reversi sunt vasis eorum vacuis, xiv 2, 3; </p>
<p>ubi `clamor Hierosolymae' pro falsis, nam quod 
`non invenerint aquas,' est quod non cognitiones veri, quae quod `aquae' sint, in Parte Prima n. 28, 680, 739 ostensum est: [6] apud Esaiam, 	Exsultabo in Hierosolymae, et laetabor in populo Meo, et 
non audietur in ea amplius vox fletus, et vox clamoris, lxv 19; </p>
<p>ubi quod `non audietur {2} vox fletus' est quod non malum, et `non vox clamoris' est quod non falsum.  Pleraque haec ex sensu litterae 
non intelligi possunt, nec quid sit `clamor,' sed ex sensu interno: [7] apud eundem, 	Exspectavit Jehovah judicium, sed ecce scabies, justitiam sed ecce clamor, v 7; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de vastatione boni et 
veri agitur; hic est reciprocationis species, ut passim quoque apud Prophetas, quae talis, quod loco veri inveniatur malum, quod est quod `pro judicio scabies,' et loco boni falsum, quod est (o)quod 
`pro justitia clamor,' nam quod `judicium' sit verum et `justitia bonum, supra n. 2235 ostensum est; [8] similis reciprocatio est ubi de Sodoma et Amora agitur apud Mosen, 	De vite Sodomae vitis eorum, 
et de agris Amorae uvae eorum; uvae fellis, botri amaritudinem illis, Deut. xxxii 32; </p>
<p>ubi {3} similis locutio, nam `vitis' praedicatur de veris et falsis, ac `agri et uvae' de bonis et malis,' ita 
quod `vitis Sodomae' sit falsum ex malo, (c)ac `agri (o)et uvae' Amorae' sint mala ex falsis, nam sunt duo genera falsi {4}, de quibus in Parte Prima n. 1212, ita etiam sunt duo genera mali; utrumque 
genus falsi et mali in hoc versu per `clamorem Sodomae et Amorae quod magnus factus, et peccatum eorum quod grave factum valde' significatur, quod inde constat quia primo loco `clamor' et secundo `peccatum' 
nominatur, et usque primo dicitur `Sodoma' quae est malum ex amore sui, et secundo `Amora' quae est falsum inde. 	@1 Heb. is [ ](Adam) = `man,' or `mankind.' In Heb. such forms may have a plural 
verb.$ 	@2 audiatur.$ 	@3 ubi similis est loquutio, nam vitis praedicatur de veris et de falsis et agri et uvae de bonis ut et de malis.$ 	@4 falsorum.$ </p>
