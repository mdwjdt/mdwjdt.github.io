<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3210节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3210.</strong>“以撒便领她进了他母亲撒拉的帐棚”表真理在神性人里面的圣所。这从“帐棚”和“母亲撒拉”的含义清楚可知：“帐棚”是指神圣之物（参看<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节），因而是指圣所；“母亲撒拉”是指神圣真理（参看<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="1901.htm">1901</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2065.htm">2065</a>，<a href="2904.htm">2904</a>节），神性人出生于神圣真理，其理性由“儿子以撒”来代表。由此明显可知，“以撒便领她进了他母亲撒拉的帐棚”表示理性良善将利百加所代表的真理引入真理的圣所。<br />至于何为真理的圣所，这从前面有关主的神性人的论述（<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>节）可以看出来。也就是说，良善与真理本质上属于神性本身，但主就神性人而言，通过神圣良善存在，从神圣真理生出（即就神性人而言）；或也可说，主的本质存在是神圣良善，而主的显化是神圣真理。神圣理性良善由此而来，祂通过人性将神圣理性良善与神圣真理联结起来。关于这极深的奥秘无法说得更详细，只能补充以下内容：真理通过人性与之联结的主神性人里面的神圣良善与真理本身，就是帐幕和圣殿中的圣所或至圣所所表示的。这良善与真理的性质由圣所里的物体来代表，如金坛，陈设饼的桌子，灯台等等，以及施恩座和约柜，还最里面的法版，就是从西乃山上所颁布的律法，也是至圣所本身，或真理的圣所。</p>

And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent. That this signifies the sanctuary of truth in the Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "tent," as being what is holy (see n. 414, 1102, 
2145, 2152, 2576), and thus a sanctuary; and from the signification of "Sarah the mother," as being Divine truth (see n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2904), of which was born the Divine Human, whose rational 
is represented by the son Isaac; whence it is evident that "Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent," signifies that rational good brought with it the truth which is represented by Rebekah, 
into the sanctuary of truth. [2] What the sanctuary of truth is may be seen from what was said above (n. 3194) concerning the Lord's Divine Human; namely, that the veriest Divine has Good and Truth; 
and that the Lord, as to the Divine Human, came forth from the Divine good, and was born (namely, as to the Divine Human* of the Divine truth; or what is the same, that the very esse of the Lord was 
Divine good, but the very existere was Divine truth: from this was the Divine good rational, with which He conjoined Divine truth from the Human. Concerning this very deep arcanum more cannot be said. 
We will only add that it is the veriest Divine good and truth in the Lord's Divine Human with which truth from the Human was conjoined, that was signified by the Sanctuary, or Holy of holies, in the 
tabernacle, and in the temple; and its quality was represented by the things therein contained, as by the golden altar, by the table on which were the showbreads [panes propositionis], by the candlestick, 
and still more internally by the propitiatory, and by the ark, and inmostly by the testimony, which was the law promulgated from Sinai, and which was the very Holy of Holies, or the Sanctuary of 
truth. * The Latin is Ipsum Divinum, but that this is a slip of the pen or misprint seems to be clearly indicated by what is said a few lines above as to the maternal parentage of the Divine Human, 
[Reviser.] </p>

'And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother' means the sanctuary of truth within the Divine Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tent' as that which is holy, dealt with in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, and so the sanctuary; and from meaning of 'Sarah his mother' as Divine truth, dealt with in <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="1901.htm">1901</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2065.htm">2065</a>, <a href="2904.htm">2904</a>, from which the Divine Human was born, the Rational of which 
is represented by 'the son Isaac'. From this it is evident that 'Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother' means that rational Good guided Truth represented by Rebekah into the sanctuary 
of truth. What the sanctuary of truth is becomes clear from what has been stated above in <a href="3194.htm">3194</a> about the Lord's Divine Human - that Good and Truth belong essentially to the Divine itself, but that the 
Lord's Divine Human came into existence from Divine Good and was born (as to the Divine itself, that is) from Divine Truth; or what amounts to the same, that the Lord's Essential Being (Esse) was Divine 
Good, but the Manifestation (Existere) of Him was Divine Truth. From this came Divine Rational Good to which He joined Divine Truth from the Human. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is impossible to say anything more about 
this very deep arcanum than this: Divine Good and Truth themselves within the Lord's Divine Human to which Truth from the Human was joined are what were meant by the Sanctuary or Holy of Holies in 
the Tabernacle and in the Temple. The nature of that Good and Truth was represented by the objects within the Sanctuary, such as the golden altar, the table with the loaves of the presence, and the 
lampstand; and further within, by the Mercy Seat and the Ark; and within it, inmostly, by the Testimony which was the Law delivered from Sinai. This was the Holy of Holies itself or Sanctuary of Truth. </p>

`Et introduxit illam Jishak in tentorium Sarae matris suae': quod significet sanctuarium veri in Divino Humano, constat a significatione `tentorii' quod sit sanctum, de qua n. 414, 1102, 2145, (x)2152, 
2576, ita sanctuarium; et a significatione `Sarae matris' quod sit verum Divinam, de qua n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2904, ex quo natum Divinum Humanum, cujus Rationale repraesentatur per `filium Jishakum'; 
inde patet quod `introduxit illam Jishak in tentorium matris suae' significet quod Bonum rationale adduxerit Verum quod per `Rebeccam' repraesentatur, apud se in sanctuarium veri. Quid sanctuarium 
veri, constare potest ab illis quae supra n. 3194 de Divino Humano Domini dicta sunt, nempe quod Ipsissimo Divino sit Bonum et Verum, et quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum exiverit ex Divino Bono 
et natus (nempe quoad Ipsum Divinum) ex Divino Vero, seu quod idem, quod ipsum Esse Domini fuerit Divinum Bonum, {1}at ipsum Existere Divinum Verum, exinde Divinum Bonum Rationale, cui Divinum Verum 
ex Humano conjunxit; [2] de arcanissimo hoc non plura dici possunt; modo quod ipsissimum Divinum Bonum et Verum in Divino Humano Domini cui conjunctum Verum ex Humano, sit quod significatum est per 
Sanctuarium, quod Sanctum sanctorum fuit in tabernaculo et in templo; et quale illius repraesentatum est per illa quae inibi, ut per altare aureum, per mensam ubi panes propositionis, per candelabrum, 
interius adhuc per propitiatorium, et per arcam, ac intime per testimonium, quod erat Lex e Sinai promulgata; haec erat ipsum Sanctum sanctorum, seu Sanctuarium Veri. @1 et$  </p>
