<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10556节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10556</strong>.“摩西回到营里”表回到这个民族的兴趣所在的外在之物。这从“营”的含义清楚可知，“营”是指圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，以色列民族的兴趣就在于这外在（参看<a href="10546.htm">10546</a>节）。现在，当摩西回到营里时，他不再代表圣言，而是代表以色列民族的首领；因为与那些兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物之人同在营里表示处于一种相似的状态。当他在营外，在那里支搭帐棚，并且离营很远时，情况就不同了。因此，摩西以哪种方式代表这个民族的首领，可从本章接下来直到末尾的经文内义清楚看出来。由于摩西现在具有这个代表，故经上说“惟有他的助手，一个少年人嫩的儿子约书亚，不离开会幕中间”，以此表示代表仍继续在营外的会幕中。</p>

And he returned unto the camp. That this signifies unto the external in which that nation was, is evident from the signification of "the camp," as being the external of the Word, of the church, and of 
worship, in which the Israelitish nation was (see n. 10546). Now when Moses has returned unto the camp, he no longer represents the Word, but the head of the Israelitish nation, for to be in the camp 
with those who were in external things separate from what is internal, denotes to be in a similar state. It was otherwise when he was without that camp and stretched the tent there, afar off from the 
camp. In what manner therefore Moses represents the head of that nation can be seen from the internal sense of what follows in this chapter down to the end. As Moses puts on this representation, it 
is therefore said that "his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a boy, moved not out of the midst of the tent," by which is signified that the representative is still continued in the tent that was outside 
the camp. </p>

'And he returned to the camp' means going back to the external in which the interest of that nation lay. This is clear from the meaning of 'the camp' as the external aspect of the Word, the Church, and 
worship, in which the interest of the Israelite nation lay, dealt with in <a href="10546.htm">10546</a>. Now, when Moses has returned to the camp, he no longer represents the Word but the head of the Israelite nation; for 
being in the camp with those whose interest lay in external things separated from what was internal means being in a similar state. It was different when he was outside that camp and pitched his tent 
there, far from the camp. How therefore Moses represents the head of that nation becomes clear from the internal sense of what follows through to the end of the chapter. Because Moses now takes on this 
representation it says that his  minister Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not move away from the midst of the tent, meaning that what is being represented nevertheless continues in the tent 
that is outside the camp.  </p>

`Et reversus est ad castra':  quod significet ad externum in quo gens illa, constat ex significatione `castrorum' quod sint externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, in quo gens Israelitica, de qua n. (x)10546. 
Nunc quando Moscheh reversus est ad castra, non amplius repraesentat Verbum, sed caput gentis Israeliticae, nam in castris esse cum illis qui in externis separatis ab interno erant, est in simili 
statu esse; aliter cum extra castra illa erat, et tentorium tetendit ibi, elongando a castris quomodo itaque Moscheh repraesentat caput illius gentis, constare potest ex sequentibus hujus capitis 
usque ad finem in sensu interno; quoniam Moscheh hanc repraesentationem {1} induit, ideo dicitur quod minister ejus Joschua filius Nunis puer non emoverit se e medio tentorii, per quod significatur quod 
repraesentativum usque {2}continuetur in tentorio quod extra castra. @1 i nunc$ @2 continuaretur$ </p>
