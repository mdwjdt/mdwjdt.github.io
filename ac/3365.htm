<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3365节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3365.</strong>“以撒就往基拉耳去，到非利士人的王亚比米勒那里”表信的教义事物。这从 “以撒”和“亚比米勒”的代表，以及“非利士人的王”和“基拉耳”的含义清楚可知：“以撒”是指主的神圣理性（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="2066.htm">2066</a>，<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节），“以撒”是指主神圣理性的神圣良善（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>节），以及由以撒与利百加的婚姻所代表的神圣真理（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节），因此“以撒”在此代表主联结于理性的神圣良善的神圣真理，因为利百加与以撒在一起，被称为“妹子”；“亚比米勒” 是指关注理性事物的信之教义（<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>，<a href="2533.htm">2533</a>节）；“非利士人的王”是指教义事物，就内义而言，“王”表属于教义的真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节），“非利士人”表认知的记忆知识，也就是教义事物（<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>节）；“基拉耳”是指信（<a href="1209.htm">1209</a>，<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>节）。从这些含义可以看出，“以撒就往基拉耳去，到非利士人的王亚比米勒那里”表示什么，即关注理性事物的教义，或也可说，信的教义事物出自主。<br />“教义事物”这个词用来描述构成教义的所有事物，并且只要教义能被天上的天使和地上的人类所接受和承认，就说它们关注理性事物。实际上，接受并承认它们的，正是理性。而理性是这样的，它绝无法理解神性事物，因为它是有限的，而有限无法理解任何无限之物。因此，来自主的神圣真理借助表象呈现在理性面前。这就是为何教义事物无非是神圣真理的表象，也就是说，无非是含有神性之物在里面的属天和属灵的容器。由于神性，就是主在它们里面，故它们激发人的情感，主由此与天使并世人联结。</p>

And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar. That this signifies the doctrinal things of faith, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord as to the Divine rational 
(see above, n. 1893, 2066, 2072, 2083, 2630; and that "Isaac" is the Lord's Divine rational as to Divine good, n. 3012, 3194, 3210; and also as to Divine truth, which is represented by the marriage 
of Isaac with Rebekah, n. 3012, 3013, 3077); thus by Isaac is here represented the Lord as to Divine truth conjoined with the Divine good of the rational; for Rebekah was with Isaac, and was called 
"sister;" from the representation of Abimelech, as being the doctrine of faith that looks to rational things (n. 2504, 2509, 2510, 2530); and from the signification of the "king of the Philistines," 
as being doctrinal things (that in the internal sense a "king" denotes the truth which is of doctrine, may be seen above, n. 1672, 2015, 2069; and that the "Philistines" signify the memory-knowledge 
of knowledges, which also is that of doctrinal things, n. 1197, 1198); and from the signification of "Gerar," as being faith (n. 1209, 2504).  This shows what is signified by Isaac's going to Abimelech 
king of the Philistines, unto Gerar, namely, that from the Lord comes the doctrine of faith that looks to rational things; or what is the same, the doctrinal things of faith. All those things are 
called doctrinal which are of doctrine, and which insofar as they can be received and acknowledged in heaven by angels, and on earth by men, are said to look to rational things, for it is the rational 
that receives and acknowledges them. But the rational is such that it cannot possibly apprehend Divine things, for it is finite, and the finite cannot apprehend what is of the infinite; and consequently 
truths Divine from the Lord are presented before the rational by means of appearances. Hence it is that doctrinal things are nothing but appearances of truth Divine, that is, nothing but celestial 
and spiritual vessels, within which is what is Divine; and because the Divine, that is, the Lord, is in them, they affect us, whence comes the conjunction of the Lord with angels and men. </p>

'And Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar' means matters of doctrine concerning faith. This is clear from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Lord as regards the Divine Rational, 
dealt with in <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="2066.htm">2066</a>, <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a> - 'Isaac' being the Lord's Divine Rational as regards Divine Good, <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>, and also as regards Divine Truth, which is represented by Isaac's 
marriage to Rebekah, <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, so that 'Isaac' here represents the Lord as regards the Divine Truth joined to the Divine Good of the Rational, since Isaac was accompanied by Rebekah, and she was 
called his sister; from the representation of 'Abimelech' as the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational concepts, <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>, <a href="2533.htm">2533</a>; from the meaning of 'the king of the Philistines' as 
matters of doctrine - 'the king' in the internal sense being truth that is the truth of doctrine, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, and 'the Philistines' the knowledge of cognitions, which are also matters of doctrine, <a href="1197.htm">1197</a>,<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>; and from the meaning of 'Gerar' as faith, <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>, <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>. From these meanings one may see what 'Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar' means, namely that the Lord 
is the source of the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational concepts, or what amounts to the same, to matters of doctrine concerning faith. </p>

 The expression 'matters of doctrine' is used 
to describe all those things that constitute doctrine, and insofar as that doctrine is able to be received and to be acknowledged in heaven by angels and on earth by men it is said to have regard to 
rational concepts. Actually it is the rational that receives and acknowledges them; but the rational is such that it cannot possibly comprehend Divine things, for it is finite, and what is finite cannot 
comprehend anything of what is Infinite. For this reason Divine truths from the Lord present themselves before the rational by means of appearances. This is why matters of doctrine are no more than 
the appearances of Divine truth, that is, no more than celestial and spiritual vessels that hold what is Divine within them. And because they hold the Divine, that is, the Lord, within them, they therefore 
stir a person's affection, and thereby the Lord is joined to angels and to men. </p>

`Et ivit Jishak ad Abimelechum regem Philistaeorum, Gerarem': quod significet doctrinalia fidei, constat a repraesentatione `Jishaki' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Rationale, de qua n. 1893, 2066, 
2072, 2083, 2630:  quod `Jishakus' sit Divinum Rationale Domini quoad Divinum Bonum, n. 3012, 3194, 3210, et quoque quoad Divinum Verum, quod repraesentatur per conjugium Jishaki cum Rebecca, n. 3012, 
3013, 3077, ita per `Jishakum' hic repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum conjunctum Divino Bono Rationalis, nam cum Jishako fuit Rebecca, {1}et dicta soror; a repraesentatione `Abimelechi' quod 
sit doctrina fidei spectans rationalia, de qua n. 2504, 2509, 2510, 2530; a significatione `regis Philistaeorum' quod sint doctrinalia; quod `rex' in sensu interno sit verum quod est doctrinalis, videatur 
n. 1672, 2015, 2069; et quod `Philistaei' sint scientia cognitionum, quae quoque est doctrinalium, n. 1197, 1198; et (c)a significatione `Geraris' quod sit fides, n. 1209, 2504; inde patet quid significatur 
per quod `iverit Jishak ad Abimelechum regem Philistaeorum, Gerarem,' nempe quod ex Domino doctrina fidei spectans rationalia, seu quod idem, doctrinalia fidei. [2] Doctrinalia dicuntur omnia 
illa quae sunt doctrinae, quae quatenus recipi possunt et agnosci in caelo ab angelis et in terra ab hominibus, dicuntur spectare rationalia; est enim rationale quod illa recipit et agnoscit; sed 
rationale est tale {2}ut nusquam capere possit Divina, est enim finitum, et hoc non capere potest illa quae sunt Infiniti, ideo Vera Divina a Domino coram rationali sistuntur per apparentias; inde est 
quod doctrinalia non sint nisi quam apparentiae Veri Divini, seu non nisi quam caelestia et spiritualia vasa in quibus Divinum; et quia Divinum in illis, hoc est, Dominus, ideo afficiunt, inde conjunctio 
Domini cum angelis et hominibus. @1 quae$  @2 quod$  </p>
