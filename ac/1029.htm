<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1029节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1029．“地上一切野兽”表其觉知的低级事物，或由此而来的意愿之物。这从前面有关“野兽”含义的说明清楚可知，因为人人都有内层事物和外层事物。内层是此处“飞鸟”所表示的理性之物，和“牲畜”所表示的情感之物。外层是“地上野兽”所表示的知识和乐趣之物。“飞鸟”、“牲畜”和“野兽”并非指真的飞鸟、牲畜和野兽，而是指活在重生之人里面的一切事物，谁都能知道并由此推论出，尽管经上说“我要与同你们一起的一切活的灵魂，就是飞鸟、牲畜、与你们在一起的地上一切野兽立约”，但神绝不可能与动物立约，而是与以它们所描述的人立约，人的内层和外层就是通过这些动物来描述的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1029.</strong> The fact that every wild animal of the earth symbolizes our lower capacities of intellect and will, coming from those higher ones, again is established by earlier demonstrations concerning the symbolism of a wild animal [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1029/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1029/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1029/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1029/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908" target=_top>908</a>].<br />Each of us has deep capacities and shallow capacities. The deeper ones are rational thoughts (symbolized by the bird) and feelings (symbolized by the beast). The shallower ones are learned facts and sensual pleasures (symbolized by the wild animals of the earth).<br />The bird, beast, and wild animal do not literally mean a bird, beast, or wild animal but a living quality in a person who has been reborn. Anyone can see this or figure it out by considering that God cannot enter into a pact with brute animals, even though it says, "I am setting up a pact with every living soul that is with you: bird, beast, and wild animal of the earth with you." He can enter into a pact only with human beings, whose deeper and shallower capacities are portrayed by those creatures. </p>

And every wild animal of the earth. That this signifies the lower things of his understanding and those of his will therefrom, is evident also from what has been said and shown before as to the signification 
of a "wild animal." For with every man there are things interior and things exterior. The interior are things of reason, here signified by "the fowl" and also affections, signified by the "beast." 
The exterior are things of knowledge [scientifica] and pleasures, which are here signified by the "wild animal of the earth." That by "fowl, beast, and wild animal" is not signified any fowl, beast, 
or wild animal, but what is living in the regenerate man, anyone may know and conclude from this, that a covenant cannot be made by God with brute animals (yet it is said, "I establish My covenant 
with every living soul that is with you, the fowl, the beast, and the wild animal of the earth with you"), but with man, who is described by them in this way as to his interiors and exteriors. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1029</b></p><p><b>1029.</b>
'With every wild animal of the earth' means lower things of the understanding or will which derive from these. This too is clear from what has been shown already about the meaning of 'a wild animal', 
for with everybody there are interior things and exterior. The interior are rational concepts which are here meant by 'birds', and affections which are meant by 'beasts'. The exterior are facts and delights 
which are meant here by 'wild animals of the earth'. That 'bird', 'beast', and 'wild animal' do not mean any bird, beast, or wild animal but that which is living with a regenerate person anyone 
may know and deduce from the fact that, in spite of the statement, 'I will establish My covenant with every living soul that is with you, with birds, with beasts, and with every wild animal with you', 
God cannot possibly enter into a covenant with animals. He can do so only with man who is being described by means of those animals as to his interior and exterior things. </p>

</p><b>1029.</b>
'Ad omnem feram terrae': quod significet ejus inferior' intellectualia et voluntaria quae inde, constat quoque ab illis qua prius de significatione ferae ostensa sunt: sunt enim apud unum quemvis hominem 
interiora et exteriora; interiora sunt rationalia qua hic significata sunt per 'avem,' et sunt affectiones quae significata per 'bestiam'; exteriora sunt scientifica et voluptates quae hic per 'feras 
terrae' significantur.  Quod per 'avem, bestiam et feram' non significetur aliqua avis, bestia aut fera, sed quod vivam est apud hominem regeneratum, unusquisque potest scire et concludere ex eo 
quod foedus iniri a Deo nequeat cum brutis animalibus, nam dicitur 'erigo foedus cum omni anima viva quae cum vobis ad avem, ad bestiam et ad feram terrae vobiscum,' sed cum homine qui quoad ejus interior' 
et exteriora ita per eas describitur. </p>
