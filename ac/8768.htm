<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8768节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8768.</strong>“就要超乎万民之上作属我的产业”表那时神性真理与他们的同在，将超过与其他人的。这从“作属耶和华或主的产业”的含义清楚可知，“作属耶和华或主的产业”是指属于主，因为“产业”是指人自己的某种东西，因而是指一种个人财产。它之所以表示那些有圣言存在于其中的人，是因为那些拥有圣言的人，也就是教会存在之地，比其他人更被称为主自己的。他们被称为“主自己的”，这一点从主在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.11.htm">1:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.2.htm">10:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.4.htm">4</a>）中的话明显看出来。那些属于教会，因而有圣言存在于其中的人被称为“祂自己的产业”，这一点清楚可见于诗篇： <br />耶拣选雅各归自己，拣选以色列特作自己的产业。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.4.htm">135:4</a>）<br />“雅各”和“以色列”在此是指那些属于教会，有圣言存在于其中的人，这是显而易见的。在摩西五经同样如此：<br />你归耶和华你神为圣民，耶和华你神从地面上的万民中为祂自己拣选你，特作自己产业的子民。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.6.htm">7:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申14.2.htm">14:2</a>）<br />那些拥有圣言的人之所以比其他人更是一种自有产业和财产，是因为他们熟悉信之真理和良善。正因如此，他们比其他人更能过天堂的生活，从而与主结合。因为构成与人同在的天堂的良善从信之真理那里接受自己的特定品质；因此，良善在那些拥有纯正真理，也就是取自圣言的真理之人当中，变得更属天堂，或更神性；但前提是这些人要遵守它们，也就是照之生活。这种情况明显可见于摩西五经：<br />你今日宣告耶和华为你的神，要行祂的道，谨守祂的律例、诫命、典章，顺从祂的声音；耶和华今日向你宣告，你要归祂作祂自己所有的子民，你谨守祂的一切诫命。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.17.htm">26:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.18.htm">18</a>）</p>

Then ye shall be Mine own possession above all peoples. That this signifies that then the Divine truth shall be with them more than with others, is evident from the signification of "being the own possession 
of Jehovah," or of the Lord, as being to be the Lord's, for "own possession" denotes property, and thus His possession. That it denotes those with whom the Word is, is because they who have the 
Word, that is, where the church is, are said to be "the Lord's own" above others. That they are called "the Lord's own," is evident from His words in John 1:11; 10:2-4. That they are called "His own 
possession" who are of the church, thus with whom the Word is, is evident in David: </p>
<p>     Jah hath chosen Jacob for Himself, and Israel for His own possession (Ps. 135:4). That "Jacob" and "Israel" 
here denote those who are of the church, with whom the Word is, is manifest. In like manner in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou art a holy people to Jehovah thy God; Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be for Himself 
a people of His own possession out of all peoples that are upon the faces of the earth (Deut. 7:6; 14:2). [2] That they who have the Word are an own possession and property above others, is because 
they know the truths and goods of faith, and because this is so they can above others live the life of heaven and thus be conjoined with the Lord. For good, which makes heaven with man, has its quality 
from the truths of faith; thus good becomes more heavenly or more Divine with those who have genuine truths, which are truths from the Word; but only if they are kept, that is, if the life is according 
to them. That this is the case is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou hast avouched Jehovah this day to be thy God, in whose ways thou wilt walk, and wilt keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His 
judgments, and wilt obey His voice; and Jehovah hath avouched to thee this day that thou be to Him for a people, of His own possession, as He hath spoken to thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His 
commandments (Deut. 26:17, 18). </p>

'You will be to Me a peculiar treasure from among all peoples' means that at that time Divine Truth will exist with them more than with others. This is clear from the meaning of 'being Jehovah's (or 
the Lord's) peculiar treasure' as being the Lord's, for 'a peculiar treasure' is something especially one's own, and so a possession. Those among whom the Word exists are meant, the reason for this being 
that those who have the Word, that is, where the Church exists, are called the Lord's own more than others; and that these are called 'His own' is clear from the Lord's words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:11;%2010:2-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:11; 10:2-4</a>. 
The fact that those who belong to the Church, thus with whom the Word exists, are called 'a peculiar treasure' is clear in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jah has chosen Jacob for Himself, and Israel to be His peculiar treasure. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20135:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 135:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Jacob' and 'Israel' are plainly those who belong to the Church, among whom the Word exists. Likewise in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You are a holy people to Jehovah your God; Jehovah your God has 
chosen you to be for Himself a people who are a peculiar treasure,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from among all peoples who are on the face of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:6;%2014:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:6; 14:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why those who have the Word are more than 
others a peculiar treasure [to the Lord] and especially His own is that they are acquainted with the truths and forms of the good of faith. This being so, they are able more than others to lead the 
life of heaven and so be joined to the Lord. For the good that constitutes heaven with a person receives its specific quality from the truths of faith. Thus good becomes more heavenly or more Divine among 
those who possess genuine truths, which are truths drawn from the Word, though only if they keep them, that is, lead a life in accordance with them. This is shown to be so in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Today you 
have declared that Jehovah is your God, and that you will go in His ways, and will keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His judgements, and will obey His voice. And Jehovah declares to you today 
that you are for Him a people who are a peculiar treasure,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> as He has told you, and that you should keep all His commandments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2026:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 26:17, 18</a>.

`Et eritis Mihi peculium ab omnibus populis': quod significet quod tunc Divinum Verum apud illos prae aliis, constat ex significatione `esse peculium Jehovae' seu `Domini' quod sit esse Domini, nam 
`peculium' est proprietas et sic possessio; quod sit apud quos Verbum, est quia proprii Domini prae aliis dicuntur qua (x)habent Verbum, hoc est, ubi est Ecclesia; quod illi proprii (x)dicantur, constat 
a Domini verbis apud Johannem i 11, x 2-4.  Quod dicantur peculium qui ab Ecclesia, ita apud quos Verbum, constat apud Davidem, Elegit Sibi Jacobum Jah, et Israelem in peculium Suum, Ps. (x)cxxxv 
4; </p>
<p>quod `Jacobus' et `Israel' sint qui ab Ecclesia, apud quos Verbum, patet: pariter apud Moschen, Populus sanctus tu Jehovae Deo tuo te elegit Jehovah Deus tuus ut sis Ipsi in populum peculii ex omnibus 
populis qui super faciebus terrae, Deut. vii 6, xiv 2. 	2 Quod illi sint peculium et proprietas prae aliis, qui habent Verbum, est quia illi sciunt vera et bona fidei; et quia ita, possunt illi 
prae aliis vivere vitam caeli et sic conjungi Domino; nam bonum, quod facit caelum apud hominem, suum quale habet a veris fidei, ita bonum fit plus caeleste seu plus Divinum apud illos qui habent genuina 
vera, quae sunt vera ex Verbo; sed si custodiuntur, hoc est, si vivitur secundum illa; {1}quod ita sit, constat apud Moschen, {2}Jehovam (x)contestatus es hodie ut sit tibi in Deum, in Cujus viis 
iturus sis, et custoditurus statuta Ipsius, et praecepta Ipsius, et judicia Ipsius, et oboediturus voci Ipsius; et Jehovah contestatur tibi hodie ut sis Ipsi in populum peculii, sicut locutus est tibi, 
et ut custodias omnia praecepta Ipsius, Deut. xxvi 17, 18. 	@1 ut quoque patet$$ 	@2 Jehovah AI$ </p>
