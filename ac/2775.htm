<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2775节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2775.</strong>“往摩利亚地去”表试探的地方和状态。这从“摩利亚地”的含义可以看出来。“摩利亚地”表试探的地方，这从亚伯拉罕受命到那里去把他儿子献为燔祭，从而经历最极端的试探明显看出来。主自己经历最极端的试探所在的耶路撒冷就在摩利亚地，这从以下事实明显可知：大卫造祭坛，以及后来所罗门建圣殿，都是摩利亚山上。这一事实从历代志清楚看出来：<br />所罗门就在耶路撒冷、耶和华向他父大卫显现的摩利亚山上，就是耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾场上、大卫预备的地方，开工建造耶和华的殿。（历代志下<a href="http://39-27.cn/代下3.1.htm">3:1</a>；对比历代志上<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上21.16.htm">21:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上21.28.htm">28</a>与撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.16.htm">24:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.25.htm">25</a>）。<br />由此足以明显可知，关于献以撒为祭所讲述的这些细节都是主的代表；否则，这一切不可能发生在亚伯拉罕当时所逗留的地方，他也不会被命令从那里起行，走了将近三天的路程。</p>

And get thee to the land of Moriah. That this signifies a place and state of temptation may be seen from the signification of the "land of Moriah." That the "land of Moriah" means a place of temptation, 
is manifest from Abraham's being commanded to go thither and offer up his son as a burnt-offering, and thus to undergo the extremity of temptation. That Jerusalem, where the Lord Himself endured the 
extremity of temptation, was in the same land, is evident from the fact that an altar was built by David on Mount Moriah, and afterwards the temple by Solomon; as is manifest from the book of Chronicles: </p>
<p> 
    Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, which was seen by David his father, in the place which David prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan [Araunah] 
the Jebusite (2 Chron. 3:1; compare 1 Chron. 21:16-28 with 2 Sam. 24:16-25). From this it is sufficiently evident that these things which are said respecting the sacrificing of Isaac are representative 
of the Lord; otherwise this might have been done where Abraham was then tarrying; and he would not have been commanded to proceed from thence a journey of nearly three days. </p>

'And get you to the land of Moriah' means a place and state of temptation. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'the land of Moriah'. It is evident that 'the land of Moriah' means a place of temptation 
from the fact that Abraham was commanded to go there and to offer his son there as a burnt offering, and in doing this to undergo the utmost degree of temptation. The fact that Jerusalem where the 
Lord Himself bore the utmost degree of temptation was situated in the land of Moriah becomes clear from the consideration that David built an altar, and subsequently Solomon the Temple, on Mount Moriah, 
as is evident from the Book of Chronicles, </p>
<blockquote>
Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, which had been shown to David his father in the place which David had prepared 
at the threshing-floor of Ornan (Araunah) the Jebusite. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Chron%203:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Chron 3: 1</a>. (Compare <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Chron%2021:%2016-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Chron 21: 16-28</a> 
</blockquote>
with <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2024:%2016-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 24: 16-25</a>.) </p>
<p>From this it may become quite clear that these details which are stated 
regarding the sacrifice of Isaac are representative of the Lord, otherwise everything could have taken place where Abraham was staying at the time and he would not have been commanded to make a journey 
from there lasting nearly three days. </p>

`Et vade tibi ad terram Moriah': quod significet locum et statum tentationis, constare potest a significatione `terrae Moriae'; quod `terra Moriae' sit locus tentationis, patet ex eo quod Abraham jussus 
sit illuc ire, et in holocaustum ibi offerre filium suum, et sic subire ultimum tentationis: quod in terra illa fuerit Hierosolyma, ubi Ipse Dominus ultimum tentationis sustinuit, constare potest 
ex eo quod in monte Moriae sit aedificatum a Davide altare, et postea a Salomone templum, ut patet ex Libro Chronicorum,      Coepit Shelomoh aedificare domum Jehovae in Hierosolyma, in      monte 
Moriae, qui visus fuit Davidi patri ejus, quem paravit      in loco David in area Arnanis ({1}Arafnae:) Jebusitae, 2      Chron. iii 1, confer 1 Chron. xxi 16-28, cum 2 Sam. xxiv      16-15: </p>
<p>inde 
satis constare potest quod haec quae de immolatione {2}Jishaki dicuntur, sint repraesentativa Domini; alioquin potuisset hoc fieri ubi Abraham morabatur, nec juberetur abinde proficisci itinere paene 
trium dierum. @1 As in 2 Sam. xxiv 16; AV Araunah$ @2 Isaci$ </p>
