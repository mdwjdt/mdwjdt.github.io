<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第493节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>493.</strong>“日子”与“年”表时间和状态，这一点无需费太多心思。只是有一点必须在此说明，在尘世，用到数字的时间与度量是必不可少的，因为它们处于自然的终端。但每当运用它们时，日子、年以及度量所用的数字均意味着完全不同于时间和度量的事物，该事物是由所用数字的意义决定的，如前文所探讨的有关六日劳作，第七日为圣的陈述；每四十九年宣布为一个禧年，庆祝第五十年的陈述；以色列支派有十二个，主的使徒也是十二个；有七十个长老，主的门徒也是七十个。还有很多其它例子，其中数字表示某种特有性质，与它们应用到的人或物完全不同。当彼此完全剥离时，剩下的就是数字所表示的状态了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]493.</strong> There is no need for me to linger any further over the symbolism of days and years as those times and states. I must only say here that in the world, the necessity for periods of time and units of measure, expressed in numbers, is unavoidable, since they are among the most concrete features of the natural world. But every time such terms are used, the number of days and years (and the numbers used in measurement) symbolize something abstracted from time (and measure). Just what is being symbolized depends on what the number is. This is true of the six days' labor and the holy seventh day, discussed above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>]. It is true of the jubilee that was proclaimed in the forty-ninth year of every cycle and celebrated in the fiftieth [Leviticus 25, 27]. It is true of the twelve tribes of Israel, matching the number of the Lord's apostles; of the seventy elders [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493/bible_king-james-version_numbers_11_16" target=_top>Numbers 11:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493/bible_king-james-version_numbers_11_24-25" target=_top>24-25</a>] and the equal number of the Lord's disciples [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493/bible_king-james-version_luke_10_1" target=_top>Luke 10:1</a>]; and of many other phenomena. The numbers in these places symbolize some special quality, as distinguished from the objects to which they apply. Once the qualities are isolated, their various states are what the numbers symbolize. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 493</b></p><p><b>493.</b>
That by "days" and "years" are signified times and states needs no further explication, except to say that in the world there must needs be times and measures, to which numbers may be applied because 
they are in the ultimates of nature; but whenever they are applied in the Word, the numbers of the days and years, and also of the measures, have a signification abstractedly from the times and measures, 
in accordance with the signification of the number; as where it is said that there are six days of labor, and that the seventh is holy, of which above; that the jubilee should be proclaimed every 
forty-ninth year, and should be celebrated in the fiftieth; that the tribes of Israel were twelve, and the apostles of the Lord the same; that there were seventy elders, and as many disciples of the 
Lord; and so in many other instances where the numbers have a special signification abstractedly from the things to which they are applied; and when thus abstracted, then it is states that are signified 
by the numbers. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 493</b></p><p><b>493.</b>
There is no need to pause too long over the consideration that 'days' and 'years mean periods of time and states. Only this need be stated here, that in the world periods of time and measurements to 
which numbers may be applied are indispensable, for they belong within the ultimate realms of nature. But whenever such application occurs, the numbers of days and years, and also the numbers applied 
to measurements, mean something which is completely different from periods of time or from measurements, and which is determined by the meaning of the number used, as in the statements about there being 
six days for work, and the seventh being holy, which are dealt with above; in the statement about a jubilee having to be announced every forty-ninth year and celebrated in the fiftieth; about the tribes 
of Israel being twelve, the same number as the Lord's Apostles; and about there being seventy elders, the same number as the Lord's disciples. And there are many other examples where the numbers 
mean some special characteristic completely different from the persons or objects to which they apply. And when completely separated one from the other the states meant by the numbers are then left. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 493</b>
</p><b>493.</b>
Quod per 'dies et annos' significentur tempora et status, non diutius immorandum est; solum hic dicendum quod in mundo non possint non esse tempora et mensurae quibus numeri applicentur quia in ultimis 
naturae; sed quoties applicantur, per numeros dierum et annorum, tum per numeros mensurarum, significatur aliqui abstracte a temporibus et mensuris secundum numeri significationem sicut quod sex dies 
laboris sint, et septimus sanctus, de quibus supra; quod jubilaeum quovis quadragesimo nono anno proclamaretur, et quinquagesimo celebraretur: quod tribus Israelis essent duodecim, quot apostoli Domini: 
quod septuaginta seniores, sicut totidem discipuli Domini: et perplura alia; ibi numeri sunt qui peculiare quoddam significant abstracte ab illis quibus applicati; cumque abstrahuntur, tunc sunt 
status qui per numeros significantur. </p>
