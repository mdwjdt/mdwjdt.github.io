<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2982节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2982.</strong>“迦南地”表该教会在主的国度是一个统一体。 这从“迦南地”的代表清楚可知，“迦南地”是指主的国度（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>节）。至于主的教会，情况是这样：古时，很多教会同时存在。在教义上，这些教会和现在的教会一样彼此有别，但它们仍成为一体，因为它们全都承认对主之爱和对邻之仁才是首要和最根本的。因此，教义的存在不是为了教导他们如何思考，而是教导他们如何生活。若对主之爱和对邻之仁，也就是生活的良善在各个方面都是最重要的，那么无论教会有多少，它们全都成为一个教会。在主的国度中，所有教会是一个统一体。天堂也一样：尽管那里有无数社群，并且每个社群都与众不同，但它们仍构成一个天堂，因为那里的所有人都被对主之爱和对邻之仁所驱动。<br />但是，对声称信是教会之根本的教会来说，情况就全然不同了。他们以为自己只要知道并思想这信便能得救，无论他们过的是哪种生活。在这种情况下，许多同时存在的教会并不构成一个教会，它们甚至算不上教会。信之良善，也就是遵守信之事物的爱与仁的生活才是那构成教会的。教义的存在是为了生活。众所周知，若非为某个目的，教义为何存在？除了生活，也就是人可以变成教义所教导的样子外，这目的还能是什么？诚然，这些教会声称得救之信就是信靠，不过，这种信靠若在于生活的良善中，是根本不可能存在的。没有生活的良善就没有任何信靠可言，除非是那种偶尔的表面信靠，如头脑或身体患病，以及属于对自我和这个世界之爱的欲望沉寂之时。但对那些生活邪恶之人而言，这种危机一过去，或情况发生变化，这种伪信靠就会完全消失。人若想知道自己拥有哪种信靠，可以检查一下自己的情感、目的，以及生活行为。</p>

In the land of Canaan. That this signifies which church is one in the Lord's kingdom, is evident from the representation of the "land of Canaan," as being the kingdom of the Lord (see n. 1413, 1437, 
1585, 1607). With the churches of the Lord, the case is this: In ancient times there were many churches at the same time; and there were as at this day distinctions among them in regard to doctrinal matters; 
but still they made a one in the fact that they acknowledged love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor as the principal and very essential thing; and therefore that the purpose of doctrinal 
things was not to teach them how to think, but how to live. And when with each and all, love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor-that is, the good of life-is the essential thing; then churches, 
however numerous they may be, make one church, all then being one in the Lord's kingdom. Such also is heaven; there are innumerable societies there, all distinct; but still they constitute one 
heaven, because in all there is love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor. [2] But the case is wholly different with churches that call faith the essential of the church; supposing that if they 
know this and think this they are saved, no matter what their life may be. In this case the several churches do not make one church, nor indeed are they churches. The good of faith, that is, the very 
life of love and of charity according to the things of faith, is that which makes the church. Doctrinal matters are for the sake of life. Everyone may know this: what are doctrinal matters except for 
the sake of all end? and what is the end but life? or that a man may become such as those doctrinal things teach?  It is indeed said that the very faith itself which saves is confidence; but this confidence 
is quite impossible except in the good of life. Without the good of life there is no reception, and where there is no reception there is no confidence, except at times a certain apparent confidence, 
in suffering conditions of mind or body, when the cupidities of the love of self and of the world are at rest. But with those who are in evil of life, when this crisis passes or the condition 
is changed, such fallacious confidence altogether vanishes; for a confidence is found even with the wicked. But whoever desires to know the quality of his confidence, let him examine in himself the affections 
and ends, as well as the practices of his life. </p>

'In the land of Canaan' means which was a united whole in the Lord's kingdom. This is clear from the representation of 'the land of Canaan' as the Lord's kingdom, dealt with in <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>. 
With the Lord's Churches the position is that in ancient times many existed simultaneously. These differed from one another, as Churches do today, on matters of doctrine, but they still made one in 
that they acknowledged love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour as the chief and most essential thing. And so to them matters of doctrine existed not so much to guide their thought as to direct 
their lives. And when in every single respect love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, that is, the good of life, is the essential thing, then no matter how many Churches there are they 
all make one, and each is a united whole in the Lord's kingdom. The same is also true of heaven. Although there are countless communities there, and each one is distinct and separate from the rest, they 
nevertheless all constitute one heaven because every one is moved by love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the situation is altogether different in the case of Churches which 
say that faith is the essential thing of the Church, for they imagine that if they know this and think it, they are saved irrespective of whatever kind of life they lead. When this is the situation 
many Churches existing simultaneously do not make one Church; they are not even Churches. The good of faith is what makes the Church, that is, the life of love and charity in accordance with matters 
of faith make it. It is for the sake of life that matters of doctrine exist. This anyone may know, for why does any doctrine exist if not for some end in view? And what else is that end but life, that 
is, that a person may become as such doctrine teaches? Those Churches do indeed speak of saving faith as being trust, but that trust cannot possibly exist except within the good of life. Without the 
latter there is no receptivity, and when there is no receptivity there is no trust, except on occasions when the mind or body is sick and the desires that belong to self-love and love of the world are 
dormant. But with those who are leading an evil life, when this crisis is over or takes a different turn, that spurious trust disappears altogether; for trust can exist even with those who are evil. 
But if a person wishes to know what kind of trust he has, let him examine his affections and ends in view, and also the kind of life his actions reveal. </p>

`In terra Canaan': quod significet quae una in regno Domini, constat a repraesentatione terrae Canaanis quod sit regnum Domini, de qua n. 1413, 1437, 1585, 1607.  Cum Ecclesiis Domini ita se habet, 
quod {1}antiquis temporibus simul plures fuerint et quod inter singulas discrimen sicut hodie quoad doctrinalia, sed quod usque unum fecerint in eo quod agnoverint amorem in Dominum et charitatem erga 
proximum pro principali et pro ipso essentiali, et sic quod doctrinalia non fuerint illis pro ita cogitare, sed pro ita vivere: et quando omnibus et singulis amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum, 
hoc est, bonum vitae, est essentiale, tunc Ecclesiae quotquot sunt, unam faciunt, {2}et quaelibet tunc est una in regno Domini: tale etiam est caelum; ibi societates {3}innumerabiles sunt, omnes distinctae 
sed usque unum caelum constituunt, quia omnibus amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum.  [2] Sed aliter prorsus se habet cum Ecclesiis quae fidem dicunt essentiale Ecclesiae, putando quod si 
{4}hoc sciant et hoc cogitent, se salvari, et hoc qualicumque vita sint; cum ita, tunc plures Ecclesiae non unam faciunt, ne quidem sunt Ecclesiae; bonum fidei est quod facit Ecclesiam, hoc est, ipsa 
vita amoris et charitatis secundum illa quae sunt fidei; propter vitam sunt doctrinalia: hoc quisque scire potest, quid enim doctrinalia nisi propter finem? et quid finis nisi vita, seu nisi talis fiat 
sicut illa docent?  Aiunt quidem quod ipsissima fides quae salvat, sit fiducia; sed fiducia illa nusquam dari potest nisi in bono vitae; absque bono vitae nulla est receptio, et ubi nulla receptio 
ibi nulla fiducia, nisi quandoque apparens quaedam in aegritudinibus anima aut corporis, cum cessant amoris sui et mundi cupiditates; at apud illos qui in malo vitae sunt, cum illa crisis abit seu vertitur, 
tunc fallax illa fiducia prorsus evanescit; datur enim fiducia etiam apud malos; sed qui scire vult qualis fiducia, exploret apud se affectiones, et fines, tum vitae exercitia. @1 ab antiquissimis$
