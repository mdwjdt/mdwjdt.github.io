<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10381节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10381</strong>.他们当中的一个灵人朝我走来。我发现他在头顶上，靠近被称为囟门的跳动凹陷处，他从那里跟我说话。他能巧妙审视我思维的一切细节，把它们始终保持在适当次序中，并将它们揭示给我。但他只能提取出诸如他能挑出错误的那类事物。他这样做，是因为来自我们地球的灵人在我周围，他根本不愿意接近他们，因为他们思想肉体事物。当他发现我的错误时，我被允许说，他挑出的错误不是我的，而是我周围的灵人的，因为我正在思想的东西不是始于我自己，而是始于这些灵人，他们正流入我的思维。他对此感到惊讶，但还是发觉事情的确如此。我被允许补充说，找出一个人的缺点不是天使所做的事，除非我们同时寻找优点。听到这话，他离开了，因为他发觉，上述的不愉快使得他这样做。</p>

A certain one of their spirits came to me, who was observed above the head, near the pulsating depression which is called the fontanel, whence he talked with me. He could skillfully explore all things 
of my thought, and keep them together in order, and show them to me. But he brought forth only such things as he could find fault with. The reason was that spirits from our earth were around me, to 
whom he was not willing to approach freely, because they think of bodily things. When he found fault with me, it was given me to say that what he blamed was not mine, but belonged to the spirits who were 
around me; because what I think, I do not think from myself, but from them by influx. He wondered at this, but yet perceived that it was so. It was given to add that it is not angelic to seek for 
the evils with a man unless we at the same time seek for the goods. On hearing this he departed, perceiving that he had acted from the indignation mentioned above. </p>

One of those spirits came towards me. I noticed him overhead, near the pulsating hollow called the fontanelle; from there he spoke to me. He was able to scrutinize skillfully all the details of my thought, 
keep them all the time in their proper order, and reveal them to me. But he drew out only such as he could find fault with. He did so because spirits from our planet were around me, whom he was 
not at all willing to go near because their thoughts were of bodily things. When he found fault with me I was allowed to say that what he found fault with did not belong to me but to the spirits around 
me, because what I was thinking did not begin in myself but in these spirits, who were influencing my thinking. He was astonished at this but nevertheless perceived that it was so. I was allowed to 
go on and say that to search out what is bad in a person is not an angelic thing to do unless at the same time one looked for what is good. Having heard this he departed, perceiving that his displeasure 
described above had caused him to do that.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10381</b>
</p><b>10381.</b>
Quidam spiritus ex illis venit ad me, qui apperceptus supra caput juxta fontem pulsatilem, qui fontanella vocatur, inde loquebatur mecum is dextre potuit explorare singula cogitationis meae, et illa 
continenter tenere in ordine, ac manifestare mihi; sed deprompsit solum talia quae posset reprehendere; causa erat quia spiritus ex nostra tellure circum me erant, ad quos, quia de corporeis cogitant, 
non libenter accedere volebat; cum me reprehenderet, dicere dabatur quod mea non sint quae reprehendit sed spirituum qui circum me, quoniam quae cogito, non ex me cogito sed ex illis per influxum; ad 
haec miratus, sed usque percipiebat quod ita esset; addere dabatur quod non angelicum sit inquirere mala apud hominem, nisi simul bona; quibus auditis discessit, percipiens quod ex indignatione, de 
qua supra, id fecerit. </p>
