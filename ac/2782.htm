<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2782节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2782.</strong>“带着两个少年人”表祂早已联结的第一理性。这从“少年人”（boy）的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，一个“少年人”（boy）和数个“少年人”（boys）具有各种含义。因为这些术语不仅适用于本家人，也适用于外来人，以及仆人；此处适用于仆人。在圣言中，人里面要服务于理性的属世之物用“仆人”来表示（参看<a href="1486.htm">1486</a>，<a href="1713.htm">1713</a>，<a href="2541.htm">2541</a>，<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>节）。然而，由于他们在此被称为“少年人”，而非“仆人”，故所表示的是要服务于神圣理性的第一理性或纯人类理性。这从一系列事件清楚看出来。</p>

And took two of his boys. That this signifies the former rational which He had adjoined, is evident from the signification of "boys." A "boy" and "boys" signify various things in the Word; because these 
terms are applied not only to the sons of the house but also to the sons of the stranger, and to servants also; here to servants. (That man's natural things which are to serve the rational are dignified 
by "servants" also in the Word, may be seen above, n. 1486, 1713, 2541, 2567.) As however they are not here called "servants," but "boys," the former or merely human rational, which was to serve 
the Divine rational, is signified; as may also be seen from the very series of the things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2782</b></p><p><b>2782.</b>
'And took two servants' means the first rational which He had allied to it. This is clear from the meaning of 'servants' or 'boys'. 'Boy' and 'boys' in the Word have various meanings because these terms 
may be used to refer not only to the sons of the house, but also to the sons of the foreigner, and to servants as well. Here servants are meant. As regards 'servants' in the Word also meaning the 
natural things in man which are to serve the rational, see <a href="1486.htm">1486</a>, <a href="1713.htm">1713</a>, <a href="2541.htm">2541</a>, <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>. Here however, since the word which otherwise means 'boys' is used and not the more usual word for servants, the first 
or merely human rational which is to be subservient to the Divine Rational is meant, as may become clear also from the actual train of thought. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2782</b>
</p><b>2782.</b>
`Et accepit duos pueros': quod significet rationale prius quod adjunxit, constat a significatione `puerorum'; puer et pueri in Verbo significant varia, quia praedicantur tam de filiis domus quam de 
filiis alienigenae, tum etiam de servis, hic de servis: quod per `servos' in Verbo significentur etiam naturalia hominis, quae inservitura rationali, videatur n. 1486, 1713, 2541, 2567; hic autem, quia 
non dicuntur servi sed pueri, significatur rationale prius seu mere humanum, quod inserviturum Rationali Divino; ut quoque constare potest ab ipsa serie rerum. </p>
