<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1770节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1770.</strong>此后有两次我看见有人被提到天使灵的第二层天，他们从那里与我对话，当时我正在阅读申命记第三章全文。他们说，他们只明白圣言的内义，同时声称，圣言的一笔一划无不具有灵义，这灵义以最优美的方式与其它一切事物联结起来。他们还说，就内义而言，圣言中提及的名字都表示真实事物。对此，这些人也照样确认了，因为他们原先不相信圣言的每一个事物都是主所启示的。他们还想在他人面前发誓肯定这一点，但未被允许。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1770.</strong> On two later occasions I saw yet others raised into the second heaven to be with angelic spirits, and they talked to me from there while I read <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1770/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_3_1-29" target=_top>Deuteronomy 3</a> from start to finish. They said they focused only on the deeper sense of the Word and stated positively that not one tip of a letter in it failed to contain a spiritual meaning that harmonized in the most beautiful way with all the other parts. They added that the names symbolize something deeper. This proved to them as well that each and every particular in the Word had been inspired by the Lord, which they had not believed earlier. They also wanted to swear to the truth of this in the presence of others but were not allowed. </p>

On two occasions afterwards I saw others taken up into the second heaven, among the angelic spirits; and they spoke with me thence while I was reading the third chapter of Deuteronomy from beginning 
to end. They said that they were solely in the interior sense of the Word; at the same time asserting that there was not a tittle in which there was not a spiritual sense that coheres most beautifully 
with all the rest, and further that the names signify real things. Thus they too were confirmed; because they had not believed before that each and all things in the Word have been inspired by the Lord; 
and this they wished to confirm before others by an oath, but it was not permitted. </p>

On two occasions after this I saw others who had been carried up to the second heaven among the angelic spirits, and from there they spoke to me, while I was reading Deuteronomy <a href="3.htm">3</a> from beginning to end. 
They said that they understood none but the interior sense of the Word, declaring at the same time that there was not even the smallest part of a letter which did not have a spiritual sense within 
it that did not link with everything else in a very beautiful way. They also said that in the interior sense the names used in the Word mean real things. Thus these people as well were confirmed in the 
same knowledge of such things, for they had not previously believed that every single thing in the Word has been inspirer) by the Lord. This they also wished to affirm before others on oath, but they 
were not allowed to do so. </p>

</p><b>1770.</b>
Binis vicibus postea vidi alios sublatos in alterum caelum inter spiritus angelicos, et inde mecum locuti, cum legerem cap. III Deut. a principio ad finem; dicebant quod solum in sensu interiore Verbi 
essent, asseverantes tunc quod ne apex quidem esset in quo non sensus spiritualis pulcherrime cum reliquis cohaerens, tum quod nomina significent res; ita confirmati quoque quia prius non crediderant, 
quod omnia et singula in Verbo a Domino inspirata fuerint; hoc voluerunt etiam coram aliis juramento confirmare, sed non permittebatur. </p>
