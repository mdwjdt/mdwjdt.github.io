<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5612节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5612.</strong>“我情愿终日是你的罪人”表教会的良善将不复存在。这从犹大的代表，以及“罪”和“终日”的含义清楚可知：指着自己说这话的犹大是指教会的良善（参看<a href="5583.htm">5583</a>，<a href="5603.htm">5603</a>节）；“罪”是指分离（参看<a href="5229.htm">5229</a>，<a href="5474.htm">5474</a>节），因而是指以下事实：它不会存在，因为与某人分离之物不再与他同在；“终日”是指永远，因而是指不再。犹大之所以说这番话，是因为教会的良善没有便雅悯所代表的内在与外在之间的居间层是不可能存在的；因为教会的良善与真理这二者从内在经由居间层流入外在；因此，居间层的存在和教会良善的存在一样重要，这就是为何犹大会为便雅悯作保。教会的良善没有居间层就不可能存在，这一点由犹大的这些话来表示；教会的真理也不可能存在，这一点由流便的话来表示（<a href="5542.htm">5542</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5612</b></p><p><b>5612.</b>
And I shall sin to thee all the days. That this signifies that the good of the church will no longer be, is evident from the representation of Judah, who says this of himself, as being the good of the 
church (see n. 5583, 5603); and from the signification of "sinning," as being disjunction (see n. 5229, 5474), thus that it will not be, for anything that is disjoined from another is not with it any 
longer; and from the signification of "all the days," as being forever, thus no longer. These things are said because the good of the church is impossible without the intermediate between the internal 
and the external which is represented by Benjamin; for both the good and the truth of the church flow from the internal through the intermediate into the external, and consequently in the degree that 
it is important to have the good of the church, in the same degree it is important to have the intermediate. It is for this reason that Judah makes himself surety for Benjamin. That the good of the 
church is not possible without the intermediate, is signified by these words of Judah, and that the truth of the church is not possible, by Reuben's words (n. 5542). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5612</b></p><p><b>5612.</b>
'Then I shall be sinning against you every day' means the good of the Church will not exist any longer. This is clear from the representation of Judah, who says this about himself, as the good of the 
Church, dealt with in <a href="5583.htm">5583</a>, <a href="5603.htm">5603</a>; from the meaning of 'sinning' as a separation, dealt with in <a href="5229.htm">5229</a>, <a href="5474.htm">5474</a>, thus the fact that it will not exist since that which is separated from someone does not exist 
with him any more; and from the meaning of 'every day' as for ever, thus not any longer. These words were spoken by Judah because the good of the Church has no existence without the intermediary, which 
is represented by 'Benjamin', between the internal and the external. For when either the good or the truth of the Church flows from the internal into the external it does so through the intermediary; 
consequently the existence of the intermediary is just as vital as the existence of the good of the Church, which is why Judah goes as surety for Benjamin. The non-existence of the good of the Church 
unless the intermediary is present is meant by these words spoken by Judah, while the non-existence of the truth of the Church is meant by those uttered by Reuben, <a href="5542.htm">5542</a>. </p>

</p><b>5612.</b>
`Et peccabo tibi omnibus diebus':  quod significet quod non bonum Ecclesiae erit amplius, constat (c)ex repraesentatione `Jehudae' qui de se haec dicit, quod sit bonum Ecclesiae, de qua n. 5583, 5603; 
a significatione `peccare' quod sit disjunctio, de qua n. 5229, 5474, ita quod non erit, nam quod disjungitur ab aliquo, hoc non est cum illo magis; et ex significatione `omnibus diebus' quod sit in 
perpetuum, ita non amplius. Haec dicta sunt quia bonum Ecclesiae dari non potest absque medio inter internum et externum, quod repraesentatur per `Benjaminem', influit enim tam bonum quam verum Ecclesiae 
ab interno per medium in externum, consequenter quantum interest ut bonum Ecclesiae sit, tantum ut sit medium; idcirco Jehudah spondet pro Benjamine; quod non bonum Ecclesiae absque medio detur, 
significatur per haec verba Jehudae; et quod nec verum Ecclesiae, per verba Reubenis n. 5542. </p>
