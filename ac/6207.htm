<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6207.</strong>天使的流注主要进入人的良知，良知里面有一个他们能进入其中进行运作的层面。该层面就存在于人的内层里面。良知是双重的，即内在和外在的。内在良知涉及属灵的良善与真理；外在良知涉及公义与公平。如今，这后一种良知存在于许多人中间；但内在良知只存在于极少数人中间。即便如此，那些具有外在良知的人在来世仍会得救；因为他们是这种人：他们若违背良善与真理，或公义与公平行事，就会感到内心的痛苦和折磨。他们有这种感受，不是因为这样做丧失了地位、利益或名声，而是因为违背了良善与真理，或公义与公平。不过，哪里没有这两种良知存在，哪里就有某种低劣的其它东西有时假装良知。也就是说，假装良知会使得人们去行真理与良善、公义与公平，但不是出于对它们的爱，而是为了自我、为了地位和个人利益。当不利的事临到这些人身上时，他们也会感到痛苦和折磨。但这种良知根本不是良知，因为它属于对自我和世界的爱，里面没有任何爱神爱邻之物。因此在来世，它便看不到了。<br />像这样的人也能履行重要职责，和那些具有真正良知的人一样；因为就外在形式而言，他们做的事都是一样的；但他们做这些事是为了自己的地位和名声。因此，他们越是害怕丧失这些东西，就越能更好地履行有利于邻舍和国家的公共职责。而那些不害怕丧失这些东西的人则是国家中完全可有可无的成员。那些具有虚假良知的人甚至不知道何为良知，当从别人那里听说何为良知时，他们还会嘲笑它，认为它是简单或精神错乱的产物。说这些话是为了叫人们知道这种流注的性质，也就是说，良知是天使能流入其中的层面，天使甚至能流入那里对良善与真理、公义与公平的情感；他们以这种方式在不拿走此人自由的情况下来约束他。</p>

The influx of the angels is especially into the conscience of man: there is the plane into which they operate. This plane is in the interiors of man. Conscience is twofold, interior and exterior. Interior 
conscience is of spiritual good and truth; exterior conscience is of justice and equity. At the present day this latter conscience exists with many; but interior conscience with few. Nevertheless 
they who enjoy exterior conscience are saved in the other life; for they are of such a character that if they act contrary to what is good and true, or contrary to what is just and equitable, they are 
inwardly distressed and tormented; not because by so doing they suffer loss of honor, of gain, or of reputation; but because they have acted contrary to good and truth, or to justice and equity. But 
where these consciences do not exist, there is something else of a very low nature which sometimes counterfeits conscience, and which leads men to do what is true and good, and what is just and equitable, 
not from the love of these, but for the sake of self and their own honor and advantage. These persons also are distressed and tormented when adverse things befall them. But this conscience is no 
conscience, because it belongs to the love of self and of the world, and there is nothing in it which regards the love of God and of the neighbor; and therefore in the other life it does not show itself. 
Men of this description can also perform duties of considerable eminence, like those who enjoy genuine conscience; for in the external form they act in a similar way; but for the sake of their own 
honor and reputation; and therefore the more they fear the loss of these, the better do they perform public duties in favor of their neighbor and of their country; whereas those who do not fear the 
loss of these things are members of the commonwealth who are worthy only of rejection. They who are in this false conscience do not even know what conscience is, and when they are told by others what 
it is, they deride it and believe it to be the result of simplicity or of mental disorder. These things have been said in order that it may be known how the case is with influx, namely, that conscience 
is the plane into which the angels flow, and indeed into the affections of good and truth, and of justice and equity therein; and that in this way they hold the man bound, yet still in freedom. </p>

The influx from angels takes place primarily into a person's conscience, in which there is a base laid down for them to operate into. This base exists within the interior parts of the person. Conscience 
is twofold - interior and exterior. Interior conscience is a conscience concerned with what is spiritually good and true, exterior conscience with what is just and fair. The latter kind of conscience 
exists with many at the present day, but interior conscience with few. Even so, those endowed with exterior conscience are saved in the next life, since they are the kind of people who, if they act 
contrary to what is good and true or contrary to what is just and fair, feel distressed and tormented within. They feel this way not because of any consequent loss of position, gain, or reputation but 
because they have acted contrary to what is good and true or just and fair. But where neither kind of conscience exists there is something very inferior to them which on occasions simulates conscience. 
That is to say, a simulation of conscience exists when people are moved to practise what is true and good, fair and just, not by a love of it but for selfish reasons, for position and personal gain. 
These people too feel distressed and tormented when things unacceptable to them occur; but this kind of conscience is no conscience at all because it goes with self-love and love of the world and 
has nothing in it of the love of God and of one's neighbour. Nor is it therefore to be seen in the next life. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 People like this are also able to serve in quite high-ranking offices, just as those 
endowed with genuine conscience do, for to outward appearance they do the same kinds of things; but they do them for the sake of their own position and reputation. Therefore the more they fear the loss 
of the latter, the better they discharge their public duties in favour of neighbour and country. But people who do not fear their loss are utterly dispensable members of the state. Those with this 
false conscience do not even know what conscience is, and when they hear from others what it is they laugh at the idea and think it is the product of simplicity or sickness of mind. These matters have 
been stated so that people may know the nature of this influx, that is to say, that conscience is the base that has been laid down for the angels to flow into - in particular into the affections there 
for what is good and true, and for what is just and fair - and thereby bind and hold the person, though without taking away his freedom. </p>

Angelorum influxus est imprimis in conscientiam hominis, ibi est planum in quod operantur; hoc planum est in interioribus hominis.  Conscientia est duplex, interior et exterior, conscientia interior 
est boni et veri spiritualis, conscientia exterior est justi et aequi; haec conscientia datur hodie apud plures sed interior apud (x)paucos; at usque qui illa conscientia gaudent, salvantur in altera 
vita; sunt enim tales ut si contra bonum et verum, aut contra justum et aequum agunt, angantur et crucientur intus; non quod inde honor aut lucrum aut fama pereat, sed quia contra bonum et verum, aut 
justum et aequum egerant.  Ast ubi hae conscientiae non sunt, est infimum quoddam quod aliquoties mentitur conscientiam, nempe ut verum et bonum, ac aequum et justum faciant non ex amore illorum sed 
propter se, suum honorem et lucrum; hi quoque anguntur et cruciantur cum adversa illis obveniunt, sed haec conscientia est nulla conscientia quia est amoris sui et mundi, et in illa nihil est de amore 
Dei et proximi, quare in altera vita nec apparet.  [2]Qui tales sunt, etiam possunt officiis eminentioribus fungi sicut illi qui genuina conscientia gaudent, nam in forma externa faciunt similia, sed 
sui honoris et famae causa; quo itaque plus horum jacturam timent, eo melius munera publica ad favorem proximi et patriae obeunt; at qui non timent jacturam illorum, sunt in republica prorsus rejectibilia 
membra.  Qui in falsa hac conscientia sunt, ne quidem sciunt quid conscientia, et cum audiunt ab aliis quid sit, irrident et credunt simplicitatis esse aut aegritudinis animi.  Haec dicta sunt ut 
sciatur quomodo cum influxu se habet, quod nempe conscientia sit planum in quod angeli influant, et quidem in affectiones boni et veri, ac justi et aequi ibi, ac sic teneant hominem vinctum, at usque 
in libero. </p>
