<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>553.</strong>天堂中彼此相爱的人不断朝着青春年华迈进，时间越长，他们就越靠近快乐幸福的青春年华，不仅持续到永远，且随着其爱、仁、信的增长而增长。那些在衰老期死去的曾信主、爱邻、与丈夫相亲相爱的老妪，随着时间推移，将越发进入花样年华，呈现世人未曾目睹也无法想象的美。善良和仁爱赋予其如此美丽的形相，使得爱的快乐和优雅从其面庞的每一个轮廓焕发出来，使其成为爱的化身。一些人看到如此美丽的形相，都惊呆了。<br />在天堂，仁爱的形相表现如此，因为正是仁爱本身成了可见的形相。事实上，它以这样的方式呈现，以致整个天使，特别是脸庞，实际就是仁爱本身的显现。该形相显现时，其美是无可言喻的，并以仁爱感染人的最深处。总之，在天堂越年长就越年轻。爱主爱邻之人，在灵界将变成如此美丽的形相。所有天使都是这种形相，呈现无数的多样性，而天堂就是由这些形式构成的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]553.</strong> Those who know how to share love are constantly advancing into the springtime of their youth in heaven, and the more millennia they live, the more joyful and happy that springtime is. Their progress continues forever, its never-ending increase determined by their development and growth in the capacity for sharing love, in charity, and in faith.<br />A woman who dies old, worn out by age, and who lived a life marked by faith in the Lord, charity toward her neighbors, and a happy, loving marriage with her husband — such a woman develops more and more of the bloom of mid- and early womanhood with the passage of years. She takes on a loveliness that eclipses any conception of beauty ever seen by the eye. Virtue and kindness are what shape her and make her a likeness of themselves. They cause the joy and beauty of neighborly love to shine out from the smallest details of her face, so that she becomes a form of charity itself. Some observers have been struck speechless on seeing these women.<br />[2] The inner workings of charity are such that charity itself is what provides the visible form and is the thing expressed in that form too. This is clear from actual experience in the other life. The whole angel, especially the face, is charity, which is both clearly presented to view and clearly perceived. To see the form is to see inexpressible beauty that touches the deepest, living reaches of the mind, filling them with charity. The beauty of the form provides an image in which religious truth is displayed — truth that is also perceived from that form.<br />Those who have lived a life marked by faith in the Lord, that is, by the faith that comes of charity, become these visible forms — these beauties — in the next life. All angels are such forms, in unlimited variety. Of them heaven is made. </p>

They who are in mutual love in heaven are continually advancing to the springtime of their youth, and to a more and more gladsome and happy spring the more thousands of years they live, and this with 
continual increase to eternity, according to the advance and degree of mutual love, charity, and faith. Those of the female sex who have died in old age and enfeebled with years, and who have lived in 
faith in the Lord, in charity toward the neighbor, and in happy conjugial love with their husbands, after a succession of years come more and more into the bloom of youth and early womanhood, and into 
a beauty that surpasses all idea of beauty such as is ever perceptible to the natural sight; for it is goodness and charity forming and presenting their own likeness, and causing the delight and beauty 
of charity to shine forth from every least feature of the countenance, so that they are the very forms of charity: some have beheld them and been amazed. The form of charity, as is seen to the life 
in the other world, is such that it is charity itself that portrays and is portrayed, and this in such a manner that the whole angel, and especially the face, is as it were charity, the charity both 
plainly appearing to the view and being perceived by the mind. When this form is beheld, it is unutterable beauty that affects with charity the very inmost life of the beholder's mind. Through the beauty 
of this form the truths of faith are presented to view in an image, and are even perceived from it. Such forms, or such beauties, do those become in the other life who have lived in faith in the 
Lord, that is, in the faith of charity. All the angels are such forms, with countless variety, and of such is heaven. </p>
<p>     CHAPTER 6.      1. And it came to pass that man began to multiply himself 
upon the faces of the ground, and daughters were born unto them.      2. And the sons of God saw the daughters of man that they were good; and they took to themselves wives of all that they chose.  
    3. And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not reprove man forever, for that he is flesh; and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.      4. There were Nephilim in the earth in those days; and 
most especially after the sons of God went in unto the daughters of man, and they bare to them; the same became mighty men, who were of old, men of renown.      5. And Jehovah saw that the evil of man 
was multiplied on the earth, and that all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil every day.      6. And it repented Jehovah that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him 
at His heart.      7. And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from upon the faces of the ground, both man and beast, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heavens; for it repenteth 
me that I have made him.      8. And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah. </p>

In heaven those who are moved by mutual love are constantly approaching the spring-time of their youth. And the more thousands of years they live the more joyful and happy the spring-time which they 
are approaching. This process continues for ever, constantly bringing increases in joy and happiness in proportion to the advance and upward progress in mutual love, charity, and faith. Those of the feminine 
sex who have died worn out with age but who had lived in faith in the Lord, in charity towards the neighbour, and in happy conjugial love with their husbands, as the years pass by come more and 
more into the first freshness of youth and early womanhood, and into a beauty that excels every idea of beauty which the eye can possibly behold. In fact it is goodness and charity forming and producing 
a likeness of itself, and causing the joy and beauty of charity to shine out of every individual feature of the face in such a way that these too are forms of charity. When some people have seen 
these they have been dumbfounded.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The form which charity takes is so plainly visible in the next life that charity itself is that which produces the form, as well as being that which is portrayed 
within it. Indeed that form is such that the whole of an angel, especially the face, is so to speak charity - charity which is visible to the eye and perceptible to the mind. When it is beheld that 
form is one of indescribable beauty which stirs with charity the inmost life itself of the beholder's mind. Through the beauty of that form truths of faith are displayed in a visual image from which 
they also are perceived. People who have lived in faith in the Lord, that is, faith that inheres in charity, in the next life become such forms, that is, forms of beauty. All angels are such forms, endlessly 
varying; and it is these forms that constitute heaven.  </p>

Qui in amore mutuo sunt, in caelo continue ad vernum adolescentiae suae pergunt; et quo plura millia annorum vivant, eo ad vernum jucundius et felicius, et hoc in aeternum cum continuis incrementis, 
secundum amoris mutui, charitatis et fidei progressus et gradus.  Ex sexu feminino quae seniles ac senio confectae mortuae sunt, et in fide in Dominum, [in] charitate erga proximum, et in amore conjugiali 
felici cum marito vixerunt, post annorum successum magis et magis in juventutis et adolescentiae florem veniunt, inque pulchritudinem quae excedit omnem pulchritudinis ideam usquam visu perceptibilem: 
bonitas enim et charitas est quae format, et sui simile sistit, et facit ut jucundum et pulchrum charitatis ex singularissimis faciei eluceat sic ut ipsae charitatis formae sint: visae sunt quibusdam 
et obstupuerunt.  [2] Charitatis forma est talis quae ad vivum conspicitur in altera vita, quod ipsa charitas sit quae effigiat et effigiatur, et quidem sic ut totus angelus, cumprimis facies, 
sit quasi charitas, quae manifeste et apparet et percipitur; quae forma cum spectatur, est pulchritudo ineffabilis afficiens charitate ipsam vitam mentis intimam; per pulchritudinem illius formae exhibentur, 
in imagine, vera fidei, quae quoque inde percipiuntur.  Qui in fide in Dominum vixerunt, hoc est, in fide charitatis, tales formae seu tales pulchritudines in altera vita fiunt; omnes angeli tales 
formae sunt cum innumerabili varietate; ex his caelum. </p>
<p>                          CAPUT VI 	1.  ET fuit, quod inciperet homo multiplicare se super faciebus humi, et filiae natae iis. 	2.  Et 
viderunt filii Dei filias hominis, quod bonae illae, et acceperunt sibi uxores ab omnibus quas eligebant. 	3.  Et dixit Jehovah, Non arguet spiritus Meus hominem in perpetuum, eo quod ille caro; et erunt 
dies ejus centum et viginti anni. 	4.  Nephilim fuerunt in terra in diebus istis, et quam maxime postquam Intrabant filii Dei ad filias hominis, et genuerunt eis; hi viri fortes, qui a saeculo viri 
nominis. 	5.  Et Vidit JEHOVAH, quod multiplicatum malum hominis in terra; et omne figmentum cogitationum cordis ejus solummodo malum omni die. 	6.  Et paenituit JEHOVAH, quod fecerit hominem in 
terra; et doluit Ipsi ad cor Ipsius. 	7.  Et dixit JEHOVAH, Delebo hominem quem creavi desuper faciebus humi, ab homine usque ad bestiam, usque ad reptile, et usque ad avem caelorum, quia paenitet Me 
quod feci ea. 8.  Et Noah invenit gratiam in oculis JEHOVAE. </p>
