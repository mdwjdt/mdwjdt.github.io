<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6618节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6618.</strong>有些灵人吹嘘说，他们知道一切；在大人里面，这些灵人与记忆有关。但他们被告知，有无穷无尽的事物是他们所不知道的；事实上，一个观念能充满无限量的细节；尽管如此，他们却还是把它看成一个简单的观念。这些灵人还被告知，即便这些观念每天以进一步的细节来填满，直到永远，他们甚至无法知道它们的所有总体方面；从这个事实他们就能推断出他们所不知道的东西有多少。这一事实也向他们充分证明了，好叫他们承认。一位天使通过状态变化与他们说话，但他们却不明白他在说什么。这时，他们被告知，每个状态变化都包含无限方面；然而，他们甚至没有意识到它们的存在；不光不明白天使所说的话，他们甚至对这些话无动于衷。</p>

Certain spirits boasted that they knew all things. In the Grand Man these spirits bear relation to the memory. But they were told that there are illimitable things which they do not know, nay, that one 
idea can be filled with illimitable ideas and still appear simple; and also that if their ideas were to be filled with many things every day to all eternity, they could not know even all the general 
things; and that from this they might conclude how much there is which they do not know. This was also shown them, so that they acknowledged it. An angel spoke with them by changes of state, but they 
could not understand what he spoke; and then they were told that every change contained illimitable things, which nevertheless were not even noticed by them, for besides not understanding, they were 
not even affected with them. </p>

Some spirits once boasted that they knew all things; in the Grand Man these spirits correlate with the memory. But they were told that there is a limitless number of things that they do not know, indeed 
that one idea can be filled out with limitless details, in spite of which it would still be seen by them as one simple idea. Those spirits were also told that even if those ideas went on being filled 
out every day forever with further details they could not know even all their general aspects, from which fact they would be able to deduce how much there was that they did not know. The truth of 
this was thoroughly demonstrated to them, so that they would acknowledge it. An angel spoke to them by means of changes of state, but they could not understand what he conveyed to them. At this point 
they were told that each change of state contained limitless aspects, the existence of which however they were not even aware of; for apart from the fact that they did not understand what the angel conveyed 
to them, they were not stirred by any affection for it. </p>

Quidam spiritus gloriati sunt quod omnia scirent; spiritus illi in Maximo Homine referunt memoriam; sed illis dictum quod indefinita sint quae non sciunt, immo quod una idea impleri possit indefinitis, 
et quod illa {1} usque {2}appareret sicut simplex; tum quod (t)si in aeternum quotidie pluribus implerentur ideae, ne quidem omnia communia scire possent, et quod inde concludere quirent quantum sit 
quod non sciunt; hoc quoque illis ostensum est usque ut agnoscerent; locutus est angelus cum illis per mutationes status, sed illa quae locutus, non potuerunt {3}intelligere; et tunc iis dictum quod 
unaquaevis mutatio indefinita {4}contineret, quae tamen apud illos ne quidem appercipiuntur, nam praeter quod non intelligerent, nec afficiebantur illis. @1 i tamen$ @2 appareat modo$ @3 percipere$ @4
