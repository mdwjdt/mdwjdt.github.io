<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4763节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4763.</strong>“就撕裂自己的衣服”表哀恸，也就是说，因真理被毁，或信不复存在而哀恸。我们在圣言，尤其历史部分经常读到人们撕裂衣服；如今这种行为的起源却不为人知。人们也不知道它代表因真理被毁而悲伤。这种行为因以下事实而成为代表：“衣服”表示真理，如前所示（<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>节）。在这一章，经上还说，当雅各认出他儿子的外衣时，他便撕裂衣服（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.34.htm">37:34</a>），以此表示因真理被毁而哀恸。圣言的其它地方也有类似例子，如亚述王西拿基立所差遣的拉伯沙基出言侮辱耶路撒冷时，王的家宰以利亚敬，书记舍伯那和史官约亚因此都撕裂衣服，把这些话告诉了希西家王；王听见也撕裂衣服，披上麻布（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛36.22.htm">36:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.1.htm">37:1</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下18.37.htm">18:37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下19.1.htm">19:1</a>）。拉伯沙基所说侮辱的话针对的是神、王和耶路撒冷，因而是神性真理，这一点从这段经文的内义看得更明显。因此，撕裂衣服是为了表达哀恸。<br />当狂底在王面前念诵耶利米所写的书卷时，经上说，王将书卷扔在火盆中，王和听见这一切话的臣仆都不惧怕，也不撕裂衣服（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶36.23.htm">36:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶36.24.htm">24</a>）；他们不撕裂衣服表示当神性真理不被接受时，他们不哀恸。当窥探地的人带来迦南地的坏消息，说不利于它们的话时，嫩的儿子约书亚和耶孚尼的儿子迦勒撕裂衣服（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.6.htm">14:6</a>）也具有同样的含义；因为“迦南地”表示主的国度，说不利于它的话就是说反对神性真理的虚假的话。当神的约柜被非利士人掳去，以利的两个儿子都被杀了时，有一个人从阵上逃跑，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，来到示罗（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.11.htm">4:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.12.htm">12</a>），表示对丧失神性真理和神性良善的哀恸。因为“约柜”代表主的国度，在至高意义上代表主自己，因而代表教会的一切神圣事物，“撕裂衣服”表示因丧失神性真理而悲伤；“头蒙灰尘”表示因丧失神性良善而悲伤。<br />论到撒母耳和扫罗，我们读到：<br />撒母耳转身要走，扫罗就扯住他外袍的衣襟，衣襟就撕断了。撒母耳对他说，如此，今日耶和华使以色列国与你断绝，将这国赐与你的同伴。我不同你回去，因为你厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作以色列的王。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.26.htm">15:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.28.htm">28</a>）<br />扫罗撕断撒母耳外袍的衣襟代表撒母耳当时所说的话，即以色列国与他断绝，他将不再是以色列的王。因为“国”在内义上表示神性真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>，<a href="4691.htm">4691</a>节），“王”和“王权”也是（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>节），以色列国和王尤其如此，因为以色列代表主的王权。关于耶罗波安和先知亚希雅的记载意思也一样：<br />当耶罗波安出了耶路撒冷，先知亚希雅在路上遇见他，亚希雅身上穿着一件新衣，唯独他们二人在田野时，亚希雅一把抓住自己身上的新衣裳，把它撕成十二片；对耶罗波安说，你可以拿十片。耶和华以色列的神如此说，看哪，我必将国从所罗门手里夺回，将十个支派赐给你。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上11.29.htm">11:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上11.31.htm">31</a>）<br />撒母耳记下同样记载，当扫罗在战争中被杀时，他们撕裂衣服：<br />扫罗在战争中被杀后，第三天，有一人从扫罗的营里出来，衣服撕裂；当大卫听到扫罗的死讯时，大卫就抓住自己的衣服，把它们撕裂了；跟随他的人也是如此。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这也代表因那些坚持与仁分离之信的人丧失并抛弃神性真理而哀恸。因为如前所述，“王权”表示神性真理，而杀扫罗的“非利士人”代表持守与仁分离之信的信徒（<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>，<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>节）。这一点同样从在这一章所作的哀歌（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.17.htm">1:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.27.htm">27</a>）明显看出来。<br />当押沙龙杀了他兄弟暗嫩，有风声传到大卫那里说，押沙龙将王的众子都杀了时，大卫就“撕裂衣服，躺在地上。王的臣仆也都撕裂衣服，站在旁边”（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.28.htm">13:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.30.htm">30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.31.htm">31</a>）。这样做也是为了代表来自神性的真理被毁，这些真理在内义上由“王的众子”来表示。当大卫从押沙龙面前逃跑时，他遇见亚基人户筛，衣服撕裂（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下15.32.htm">15:32</a>），这段经文意思也一样；因为在圣言中，王，尤其大卫，代表神性真理。当以利亚将耶和华的话告诉以色列王亚哈说，他将因自己所行的恶而被除尽时，亚哈就撕裂衣服，身披麻布，这段经文意思也差不多是这样（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上21.27.htm">21:27</a>）。<br />撕裂或撕碎衣服代表因丧失真理而哀恸，这一事实从以下经文进一步清楚看出来：<br />祭司希勒家在耶和华殿里得了律法书；沙番就在约西亚王面前读那书。王听见律法书上的话，便撕裂衣服。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下22.11.htm">22:11</a>）<br />显然，王之所以这么做，是因为圣言，即神性真理丧失太久，已从他们心里和生活中被抹除了。当主承认祂是基督，是神的儿子时，大祭司就撕开衣服，说，祂说了僭妄的话（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.63.htm">26:63</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.65.htm">65</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.63.htm">14:63</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.64.htm">64</a>），这段经文表示大祭司完全确信主说了反对圣言，因而反对神性真理的话。<br />当以利乘旋风上升，以利沙看见时，以利沙抓住自己的衣服，把它们撕成两片；他拾起以利亚身上掉下来的外衣，用它打水，水也左右分开，以利沙就过来了（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.11.htm">2:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.14.htm">14</a>）；那时以利沙把衣服撒成两片，是为了哀恸圣言，也就是神性真理丧失了；因为以利亚代表主的圣言，也就是神性真理（<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。从以利亚身上掉下来并被以利沙拾起的外衣代表以利沙延续以利亚的代表，因为“外衣”表示神性真理（参看<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>节）。这也解释了为何当进行这种哀恸时，被撕裂的衣服是外衣，这一点从上面所引用的某些经文明显看出来。“衣服”因表示教会的真理，在至高意义上表示神性真理，故若非在哀恸，穿着撕裂的衣服出行是可耻的。这一点从哈嫩向大卫臣仆所行的事明显看出来，因为他将他们的胡须剃去一半，又割断他们下半截的衣服；因此，他们不可到大卫那里（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下10.4.htm">10:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下10.5.htm">5</a>）。</p>

And he rent his garments. That this signifies mourning, is evident from the signification of "rending the garments," as being mourning, namely, on account of truth having been destroyed, or because there 
was no faith. We often read in the Word, especially the historic, of persons rending their garments; but the origin of this is not known at the present day, and it is also unknown that it was representative 
of grief on account of truth being lost. This act became representative from the fact that "garments" signified truths, as before shown (n. 4545). Further on in this chapter it is also said 
that when Jacob recognized his son's tunic he rent his garments (verse 34), and by this is signified mourning for truth destroyed. So in other places in the Word, as when Rabshakeh, who was sent by 
Sennacherib the king of Assyria, spoke insults against Jerusalem; whereupon Eliakim who was over the King's household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the recorder, rent their garments and told these 
things to King Hezekiah; and when the king heard it he also rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth (Isa. 36:22; 37:1; 2 Kings 18:37; 19:1). The insults which Rabshakeh spoke were against 
God, the King, and Jerusalem, thus against Divine truth, as is still plainer from the internal sense of the passage; hence the garments were rent because of mourning. [2] When Jehudi had read before 
the king the roll of the book which Jeremiah wrote, it is said that the king cast it into the fire, and that the king and his servants, who heard all those words, did not rend their garments (Jer. 36:23, 
24); their not rending their garments denoted that they did not mourn when Divine truth was not received. The rending of their garments by Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, 
when the spies brought an evil report of the land of Canaan, and their speaking against them (Num. 14:6), involves a similar meaning; for the land of Canaan signifies the Lord's kingdom, to speak against 
which is to speak falsity against Divine truth. When the ark of God was taken by the Philistines, and the two sons of Eli were slain, that there ran a man out of the army to Shiloh with his garments 
rent and dust upon his head (1 Sam. 4:11, 12), signified mourning over lost Divine truth and Divine good; for, as the ark represented the Lord's kingdom, and in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, 
and hence the holy of the church, the rent garments signified mourning over lost Divine truth; and dust upon the head, over lost Divine good. [3] We read of Samuel and Saul: </p>
<p>     As Samuel turned about 
to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his tunic, and it was torn off. And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from upon thee this day, and hath given it to thy companion. 
I will not return with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel (1 Sam. 15:26-28); </p>
<p>Saul's tearing off the skirt of Samuel's 
tunic represented what Samuel said - that the kingdom should be rent from him, and that he should no longer be king of Israel; for "kingdom" in the internal sense signifies Divine truth (n. 1672, 2547, 
4691), as also do a "king" and "royalty" (n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581), and specifically the Kingdom and king of Israel, because by Israel was represented the Lord's royalty. 
So what is related of Jeroboam and the prophet Ahijah: </p>
<p>     When Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah found him in the way, when he had clad himself with a new garment, and they two 
were alone in the field, Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was upon him, and rent it in twelve pieces; and he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, 
Behold I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee (1 Kings 11:29-31). [4] The same is true of their rending their garments when Saul was slain in battle, as related 
in the second book of Samuel: </p>
<p>     After Saul had been slain in battle, on the third day a man came from the camp whose garments were rent; and when David heard of the death of Saul, David took hold 
of his garments and rent them; as did all his servants that were with him (2 Sam. 1:1-2, 11); </p>
<p>by this also was represented mourning on account of Divine truth lost and thrown away by those who were 
in faith separate; for as before said Divine truth was signified by royalty, and they who were in faith separate were represented by the Philistines, by whom Saul was slain (n. 1197, 1198, 3412, 3413); 
as also is evident from David's lament over him in the same chapter (2 Sam. 1:17-27). [5] When Absalom had smitten his brother Amnon, and the tidings came to David that Absalom had smitten all the 
king's sons, David "rent his garments and lay on the earth, and all his servants stood by with their garments rent" (2 Sam. 13:28, 30-31); this also was done for the sake of representing that truths 
from the Divine were destroyed, these being signified in the internal sense by the king's sons. So when David fled before Absalom he was met by Hushai the Archite with his tunic rent (2 Sam. 15:32); 
for in the Word by a king, especially by David, is represented Divine truth. In like manner also when Elijah spoke to Ahab king of Israel the words of Jehovah, that he should be extirpated on account 
of the evil which he had done, Ahab rent his garments and put sackcloth upon his flesh (1 Kings 21:27). [6] That the rending or tearing of garments represented mourning on account of lost truth, is further 
evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah; and Shaphan read it before king Josiah. And when the king heard the words of the 
book of the law, he rent his garments (2 Kings 22:11); </p>
<p>manifestly on account of the Word (that is, Divine truth) having been so long lost, and obliterated in hearts and life. When the Lord confessed 
that He was the Christ the Son of God, that the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy (Matt. 26:63-65; Mark 14:63, 64), signified that he had no other belief than that the Lord 
spoke against the Word, and thus against Divine truth.  [7] When Elijah went up in a whirlwind, and Elisha saw it, he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces; and he took up the 
tunic of Elijah that fell from upon him, and smote the waters, and they were parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over (2 Kings 2:11-14); that Elisha then rent his garments in two pieces was on 
account of mourning that the Word (that is, Divine truth) was lost; for by Elijah is represented the Lord as to the Word, that is, Divine truth (n. 2762). The tunic falling from Elijah, and being taken 
up by Elisha, represented that Elisha continued the representation. That a tunic is Divine truth may be seen above (n. 4677), wherefore also the garment which was rent in such mourning was the tunic, 
as is evident from some of the passages above cited. As a "garment" signified the truth of the church, and in the supreme sense Divine truth, it was therefore a disgrace to go with rent garments, 
except in such mourning - as is evident from what was done to the servants of David by Hanun the king of the sons of Ammon, in that he shaved off half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the 
middle, even to their buttocks; for which reason they were not admitted to David (2 Sam. 10:4, 5). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4763</b></p><p><b>4763.</b>
'And he rent his clothes' means mourning. This is clear from the meaning of 'rending clothes' as mourning, that is to say, mourning on account of the loss of truth, or the fact that no faith exists. 
In the Word, especially the historical part, one often reads about people rending their clothes, but the origin of that practice is not known at the present day. Nor is it known that it was representative 
of grief on account of the loss of truth. This practice became representative from the fact that 'clothes' meant truths, as has been shown and may be seen in <a href="4545.htm">4545</a>. Further on in this chapter it is 
also said that when Jacob recognized his son's tunic he rent his clothes, verse 34, by which mourning for lost truth is meant. Similar instances of this practice occur elsewhere in the Word, where it 
is stated that when the Rabshakeh was sent by Sennacherib king of Asshur and uttered insults against Jerusalem, Eliakim who was over the king's house, and Shebna the secretary, and Joash the recorder<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
rent their clothes and reported these things to king Hezekiah; and when he heard them the king too rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2036:22;%2037:1;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 36:22; 37:1; 2</a> Kings 18:37; 19:1. The insults 
he uttered were directed against God, the king, and Jerusalem, and so against Divine Truth, as is even more evident from the internal sense of this narrative. It was to express mourning therefore 
that their clothes were rent. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When Jehudi had read before the king the scroll which Jeremiah wrote, it is said that he threw it into the fire, but the king and his servants who were listening 
to all those words did not tear their clothes apart, Jer. 36:23, <a href="24.htm">24</a>. 'They did not tear their clothes apart' meant that they did not mourn on account of the non-acceptance of Divine Truth. Something 
similar is implied by Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh rending their clothes, when the spies spoke in opposition to them, by speaking unfavourably about the land of Canaan, Num. 14:6; 
for 'the land of Canaan' means the Lord's kingdom, and 'to speak in opposition to this' describes falsity in opposition to Divine Truth. Mourning over the loss of Divine Truth and Divine Good is meant 
where it is said, in <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam. 4:11, <a href="12.htm">12</a>, that when the ark of God was captured by the Philistines and both of Eli's sons died, a man ran from the line of battle to Shiloh, with rent clothes and dust 
on his head. Because 'the ark' represented the Lord's kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself, and consequently represented everything holy in the Church, 'rent clothes' meant grief over the 
loss of Divine Truth, while 'dust on his head' meant grief over the loss of Divine Good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the narrative about Samuel and Saul one reads, </p>
<p>When Samuel turned to go away Saul took hold of 
the skirt of his tunic, and it was torn away. Therefore Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel from upon you this day and has given it to your companion. I will not return with you, 
for you have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from being king over Israel. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam 15:26-28. </p>
<p>The tearing away by Saul of the skirt of Samuel's tunic represented that which 
Samuel then stated - that the kingdom would be torn from him and that he would not be the king of Israel any longer. For 'the kingdom' in the internal sense means Divine Truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>, <a href="4691.htm">4691</a>, as also 
does 'king' and 'kingship', <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, especially the king and the kingdom of Israel, since 'Israel' represented the Lord's kingship. The meaning is similar in 
what is recorded concerning Jeroboam and Ahijah the prophet, </p>
<p>When Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet found him on the road, when he was covered with a new garment and both were 
alone in the field, Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him and rent it into twelve pieces; and he said to Jeroboam, Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, 
behold, I am rending [the kingdom] from the hand of Solomon and I will give you ten tubes. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 11:29-31. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The second Book of Samuel likewise records that when Saul was killed in battle they 
tore their clothes apart, </p>
<p>When Saul was killed in battle, on the third day a man came from the camp, whose clothes had been rent And when David heard about the death of Saul, David took hold of his 
garments and tore them apart; and so did all his servants who were with him.	<a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 1:2, <a href="10.htm">10</a>-<a href="12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<p>This too represented mourning because of Divine Truth, lost and cast away by those who adhered to 
faith separated from charity. For as stated above, 'kingship' meant Divine Truth, while 'the Philistines' by whom Saul was slain represented adherents to faith separated from charity, <a href="1197.htm">1197</a>, <a href="1198.htm">1198</a>, <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="3413.htm">3413</a>. The same is also evident from David's lament over him, in verses 18-27 of the same chapter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 When Absalom had slain Amnon his brother and the news reached David that Absalom had slain all 
the king's sons, David tore his clothes apart and lay on the ground; and all his servants standing by tore their clothes apart, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 13:28, <a href="30.htm">30</a>, <a href="31.htm">31</a>. This too was done for the sake of the representation 
that truths from the Divine were lost, those truths being meant in the internal sense by 'the king's sons'. A similar meaning exists in the reference to Hushai the Archite who with his tunic torn 
apart came to meet David when he fled from Absalom, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 15:32; for in the Word 'a king', and in particular David, represents Divine Truth. The meaning is also very similar in the reference to Ahab, 
who tore his clothes apart and put sackcloth over his flesh when Elijah told Ahab the king of Israel the words of Jehovah, to the effect that he would be completely wiped out for the evil he had done, 
<a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 21:27-29. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that tearing apart or rending clothes represented mourning the loss of Truth is additionally clear from the following: Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the law 
in the house of Jehovah. When Shaphan read it before king Josiah and the king heard the words of the Book of the law, he tore his clothes apart, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 22:11. Plainly the king did so because the Word, 
that is, Divine truth, had been lost for so long and in their hearts and life had been blotted out. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The tearing apart of his own clothes by the high priest, when the Lord confessed He was the 
Christ the Son of God, and his declaration that He had spoken utter blasphemy, Matt. 26:63-65; Mark 14:63, <a href="64.htm">64</a>, meant that the high priest was absolutely convinced that the Lord had spoken against the 
Word and so against Divine truth. When Elijah went up in the whirlwind, and Elisha saw it, it is said, </p>
<p>He took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. And he took up Elijah's tunic 
that had fallen from upon him, and he struck the waters and they were divided this way and that, and Elisha went over. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2:11-14. </p>
<p>Elisha tore his own clothes apart at that time to express mourning 
the loss of the Word, that is, of Divine Truth; for 'Elijah' represents the Lord as regards the Word, that is, Divine Truth, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. When the tunic fell from Elijah and was picked up by Elisha, the 
continuation of Elijah's representation by Elisha was represented, 'the tunic' meaning Divine Truth, see <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>. This also explains why the garment torn apart when such mourning took place was the tunic, 
as is evident from some of the places that have been quoted. Because 'a garment' meant the truth possessed by the Church, and in the highest sense Divine Truth, it was therefore shameful, except 
when one was mourning, to go about with clothes that were torn. This is evident from what was done to David's servants by Hanun king of the children of Ammon, when he cut off half the beard of each one, 
and their garments at the middle even to their buttocks, for which reason they were not allowed to come to David, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 10:4, <a href="5.htm">5</a>.

`Et discidit vestes suas': quod significet luctum, constat a significatione `discindere vestes quod sit luctus, nempe propter verum deperditum seu quod nulla fides; in Verbo, imprimis historico, 
saepius legitur quod vestes disciderint, sed nescitur hodie unde hoc, et quoque nescitur quod id repraesentativum esset doloris propter verum quod amissum; hoc inde repraesentativum factum est quia 
`vestes' significabant vera, ut ostensum videatur n. 4545; in sequentibus hujus capitis etiam dicitur quod `cum Jacob agnovit tunicam filii sui, disciderit vestes suas', vers. 34, per quod significatur 
luctus pro deperdito vero; similiter alibi in Verbo,           Ut cum Rabshakeh missus a Sanheribo rege Asshuris,      locutus contumelias contra Hierosolymam, tunc Eliakimus... qui      super 
domum regis, et Shibna scriba, et Joahus... commentator,      discissi vestes nuntiarunt illa regi Hizkiae; ex quo audito      etiam rex discidit vestes suas, et obtexit se sacco, Esai.      xxxvi 
22; xxxvii 1; 2 Reg. xviii 37; xix 1; </p>
<p>contumeliae quas locutus, erant contra Deum, regem et Hierosolymam, ita contra Divinum Verum ut melius a sensu interno ibi patet; inde ex luctu discindebantur 
vestes: </p>
<p>          [2] Cum Jehudius legisset volumen libri coram rege, quod      scripsit Jeremias, dicitur quod projecerit id in focum,... et      non ruperint vestes suas rex et servi illius audientes 
omnia      verba illa, Jer. xxxvi 23, 24; </p>
<p>quod `non ruperint vestes' erat quod non luxerint propter Divinum Verum non acceptum: </p>
<p>          Cum exploratores locuti male de terra Canaane, quod 
tunc      Joshua filius Nunis et Chalebus filius Jephunneh,...      disciderint vestes, et locuti sint contra illos, Num. xiv 6, simile involvit; terra enim Canaan significat regnum Domini, contra quod 
loqui, est falsum contra Divinum Verum: </p>
<p>          Cum Arca Dei capta a Philistaeis, et ambo filii Eli      mortui sunt, quod vir ex acie currens Shiloh, vestibus scissis      et pulvere {1} 
super capite, 1 Sam. iv 11, 12, significabat luctum super Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum amissum, `arca' enim quia repraesentabat {2} regnum Domini, ac in supremo sensu Ipsum Dominum, (c)ac inde Ecclesiae 
sanctum; `vestes scissae' significabant luctum super Divinum Verum amissum, et `pulvis super capite' super Divinum Bonum: [3] de Samuele et Shaule legitur           Cum convertit se Samuel 
ad abeundum, Shaul apprehendit      alam {3} tunicae ejus, quae abscissa est; quare dixit ad eum      Samuel, Abscidit Jehovah regnum Israelis a super te hodie, et      dedit illud socio tuo; Non 
{4} revertar tecum, quia repudiasti      verbum Jehovae, et repudiavit te Jehovah, ut non sis rex super      Israelem, 1 Sam. xv 26-28; </p>
<p>quod `Shaul ruperit alam tunicae Samuelis' repraesentabat id 
quod Samuel dixit, nempe quod regnum abscinderetur ab eo, et quod non esset rex Israelis amplius; `regnum' enim in sensu interno significat Divinum Verum, n. 1672, 2547, 4691, et quoque `rex est regium', 
n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, (x)3009, 3670, 4575, 4581; </p>
<p>regnum et rex Israelis in specie, quia per `Israelem' repraesentabatur {5} regium Domini: similiter quod de Jeroboamo et Ahija propheta 
memoratur,           Cum Jeroboamus exiret ex Hierosolyma, et inveniret      (c)illum Ahijah propheta in via, cum ille tectus veste nova,      et ambo soli in agro, apprehendit Ahijah vestem novam 
quae      super illo, et discidit eam in duodecim frusta, et dixit      Jeroboamo, Sume tibi decem frusta, nam sic dixit Jehovah Deus      Israelis, Ecce Ego discindens [regnum] e manu Salomonis, 
et      dabo tibi decem tribus, 1 Reg. xi 29-31:(n) [4] pariter {6} quod ruperint vestes, cum Shaul in praelio occisus est, de quo in 2 Libro Samuelis,           Cum Shaul in praelio occisus est, 
die tertio vir venit e      castris, cujus vestes discissae:... et cum audivit David de      morte Shaulis, apprehendit David vestes suas et rupit eas, et      omnes servi qui cum illo, i 2, 10-12; </p>
<p>per 
hoc etiam repraesentabatur luctus ob Divinum Verum amissum, ac projectum {7} ab illis qui in fide separata; per `regium' (o)enim significabatur Divinum Verum, ut supra dictum, et {8} per `Philistaeos' 
a quibus occisus Shaul, repraesentabantur qui in fide separata {9}, n. 1197, 1198, 3412, 3413; quod etiam patet a lamentatione Davidis super illum in eodem capite, vers. 18-27: </p>
<p>          
[5] Cum Abshalom percusserat fratrem suum Ammonem,... et      fama venit ad Davidem quod percusserit Abshalom omnes filios      regis,... rupit vestes suas, et jacuit in terra, et omnes      servi 
ejus stantes rupti vestes, 2 Sam. xiii 28, 30, 31; </p>
<p>etiam hoc factum est causa repraesentationis quod vera ex Divino deperdita; `filii regis' in sensu interno illa significant: </p>
<p>          Cum fugit David 
pro Abshalomo, obviam ei fuit Hushai      Archita, ruptus tunicam suam, 2 Sam. xv 32; </p>
<p>similiter, nam per `regem', imprimis per Davidem, in Verbo repraesentatur Divinum Verum: consimiliter,   
        Cum Elias locutus ad Ahabum regem Israelis verba Jehovae,      quod exstirparetur propter malum quod fecerat, tunc Ahabus      rupit vestes suas, posuit saccum super carnem suam, 1 Reg. xxi  
    27-29. [6] Quod `ruptio aut discissio vestium' repraesentaverit luctum de amissi Vero, porro constat (c)ab his,           Hilkiah sacerdos invenit Librum legis in domo Jehovae,      cum legit 
eum Shaphan coram rege Joshia, et cum audivit rex      verba Libri legis, rupit vestes suas, 2 Reg. xxii 11; </p>
<p>manifeste propter Verbum, hoc est, verum Divinum tamdiu amissum, (c)ac in cordibus (c)et 
vita obliteratum: </p>
<p>          [7] Cum Dominus confessus quod esset Christus filius dei,      quod sacerdos magnus disruperit vestes suas, dicens Omnino      {10} blasphemavit, Matth. xxvi 63-65; Marc. 
xiv 63, 64; </p>
<p>significabat quod summus sacerdos non aliter crediderit quam quod Dominus contra Verbum, ac sic contra verum Divinum locutus sit: </p>
<p>          Cum ascendit Elias in turbine, et Elisha 
videns,...      apprehendit vestes suas et disrupit eas in duo frusta: et      sustulit tunicam Eliae, quae deciderat desuper illo,... et      percussit aquas,... et divisae sunt huc illuc {11}, et  
    transivit Elisha, 2 Reg. ii 11-14; </p>
<p>`quod Elisha tunc disruperit vestes suas in duo frusta' erat propter luctum quod Verbum, hoc est, Divinum Verum amissum fuerit, per `Eliam' enim repraesentatur 
Dominus quoad Verbum, hoc est, Divinum Verum, n. 2762; `quod tunica ab Elia deciderit et ab Elisha suscepta' repraesentabat quod Elisha continuaret repraesentationem; </p>
<p>quod `tunica' sit Divinum 
Verum, videatur n. 4677; quare etiam vestis quae discindebatur in tali luctu, erat tunica, ut patet a locis quibusdam citatis.  Quia `vestis' significabat verum Ecclesiae, (c)et in supremo sensu 
Divinum Verum, ideo contumeliosum erat scissis vestibus ire nisi in tali luctu, ut patet ab eo quod factum servis Davidis a rege filiorum Ammonis Hanun,           Quod absciderit illis dimidium barbae, 
et vestes eorum in      medio usque ad nates;... quare nec admissi ad Davidem, 2 Sam.      x 4, 5.      @1 vestes ejus scissae et pulvis$      @2 After Dominum$      @3 talam I$      @4 v.
