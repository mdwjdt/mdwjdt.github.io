<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1953节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1953．“她就称那对她说话的耶和华名为”表主的内层人在思想这些事时的状态。这从上下文，以及“称名”的含义清楚可知，“称名”就是了解其性质，如前面所解释的（<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>节）。这里描述的是该状态，也就是主在如此思想理性时所在状态的性质。理性本身无法这样思想，但内层人或更高层的人能（如前所述，<a href="1926.htm">1926</a>节）。因为理性决没有思想自己性质的能力，因为一切事物都没有看透自己的能力。思想它的必是某种更内在或更高层的事物，因为这种事物能看清它。例如，耳朵不能知道，更不能感知它接收到自己里面的话语，但更内在的听觉却能。耳朵只是辨别清晰的音节或话语，而内在听觉才是理解这些话的，之后，感知它的是内在视觉，或内视。人就是以这种方式通过听觉感知话语的含义。视觉之物也一样：从可视物体所接受的最初观念是物质的，它们也被如此称呼；但有更内在的视觉俯视它们并由此思考。这同样适用于人类理性：理性根本没有看清自己的能力，更没有探究自己性质的能力；但必有某种更内在的事物做到这一点。所以，当人有能力这样做，也就是能觉察存在于其理性中的虚假，或那里所闪耀的真理，尤其能觉察正在斗争并战胜的事物时，他就能知道，他这样做的能力源于主经由内在人的流注。前面提及（<a href="1926.htm">1926</a>节）、此处所表示的主的内层人就是那与其内在人，也就是耶和华融合之物，故远远超出那理性。祂通过内层人，如在属天之光中那样看到并直觉：这理性若唯独居于真理而不居于良善，将是何性质。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1953</b></p><p><b>1953.</b>
And she called the name of Jehovah who was speaking unto her. That this signifies the state of the Lord's interior man when it thought about these things, is evident from what precedes and what follows, 
and also from the signification of "calling a name," which is to know what is the quality (explained before, n. 144, 145, 1754). This state is described in regard to its quality, or the state in which 
the Lord was when He thus thought about the rational. The rational could not think this, but the interior or higher man could (spoken of before, n. 1926). For the rational can by no means think about 
itself in regard to its quality, for nothing can look into itself; but it must be something more internal or higher that thinks about it, for this can look into it. For example: the ear cannot know, 
and still less perceive the speech that it receives into itself: this is done by a more interior hearing. The ear merely discerns articulate sounds or words: it is the interior hearing that apprehends 
what is said, and then it is an interior sight or mental view that perceives it, and in this way there is through the hearing a perception of the meaning of the speech. The case is similar with the 
things of sight: the first ideas received from the objects of sight are material, as they are also called; but there is a sight still more interior that views the objects mentally, and thereby thinks. 
And such is the case with man's rational. The rational can by no means look into itself, still less explore its own quality: there must be something more internal that does this; and therefore when 
a man is able to do it-that is, perceive anything false in his rational, or any truth that shines there, and especially if he is able to perceive anything that is battling and overcoming-he may know 
that his ability to do this comes from the Lord's influx through the internal man. The Lord's interior man, spoken of above (n. 1926) and meant here, was that which had been conjoined with His internal 
man, which was Jehovah, and was therefore far above that rational. From that interior man, as in celestial light, He saw and perceived of what quality the rational would become if it were in truth 
alone, and not in good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1953</b></p><p><b>1953.</b>
That 'she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her' means the state of the Lord's Interior Man when it thought about these things is clear from what comes before and after, and also from the meaning 
of '[calling] the name' as knowing the nature of, dealt with already in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>. It is the nature of this state, that is, of the Lord's state as it then was when He so thought about the rational, 
that is described. The rational itself could not engage in such thought; only the Interior or higher Man, referred to in <a href="1926.htm">1926</a>, could do so. In no way does the rational have the ability to think 
regarding its own nature, for nothing has the ability to see into itself. There has to be that which is more internal or higher that thinks regarding it, for this does have the ability to see it. Take 
for example the ear. The ear is not able to know, still less to perceive, the utterance which it receives into itself; but it is the interior hearing which is able to do so. The ear merely makes out 
the articulated sounds or expressions, the interior hearing being that which grasps the meaning, and after that the interior seeing or inner sight which perceives it. This is the manner in which through 
hearing a person perceives the meaning of the utterance. It is similar with the things of sight. The first ideas received from visual objects are material, as they are also called; but sight still 
more interior surveys them and in this way engages in thought. The same also applies to man's rational. The rational has no ability at all to see itself, still less to examine its own nature; but there 
has to be something more internal to do this. Consequently when a person has the ability to do this, that is to say, to perceive anything false present in his rational and any truth shining out of it, 
and more so if he is able to perceive anything fighting and triumphing, he may know that such an ability springs from the Lord's influx through the internal man. The Lord's Interior Man, referred to 
above in <a href="1926.htm">1926</a> and meant here, was that which had been joined to the Internal Man, which was Jehovah, and so was far above that rational. From that Interior Man, as in heavenly light, He saw and perceived 
what the nature of the rational would be if truth alone and no good dwelt in it. </p>

`Et vocavit nomen Jehovae loquentis ad se': quod significet statum Interioris Hominis Domini cum illa (x)cogitavit, constat ex illis quae antecedunt et quae sequuntur, tum a significatione `nominis' 
quod sit nosse qualis est, de qua prius n. 144, 145, 1754: describitur hic status, qualis fuit, seu in quo fuit Dominus, cum ita cogitavit de rationali; rationale non potuit hoc cogitare, sed Interior 
seu superior Homo, de quo prius n. 1926; nusquam enim potest rationale cogitare de se, quale est, nam semet nemo potest intueri, sed erit interius seu superius quod de illo cogitat, quia illud intueri 
potest; sicut pro exemplo, auris non potest scire, minus percipere loquelam quam haurit, sed est interior auditio; auris modo discernit sonos articulatos seu voces, interior auditio est quae capit, 
et dein interior visus seu intuitio quae percipit, inde per auditionem apperceptio sensus loquelae; similiter se habet in visualibus; primae ideae quae ab objectis visus excipiuntur, sunt materiales, 
sicut etiam vocantur, at interior adhuc visus est qui intuetur illa, et sic cogitat; ita se habet cum rationali hominis; rationale nusquam potest se intueri, minus explorare quale est, sed erit interius 
quoddam quod hoc facit; quare dum homo hoc potest facere, nempe percipere quod falsum in suo rationali, et aliquod verum quod elucet, et magis si aliquod pugnans et vincens, scire potest quod sit 
ex influxu Domini per internum hominem.  Interior Homo Domini, de quo (o)supra 1926, et qui hic (o)intelligitur, erat ille qui conjunctus fuit Interno qui Jehovah, ita longe supra rationale illud; ex 
illo ut in caelesti luce, videbat et percipiebat quale rationale futurum, si in solo vero esset, non bono. </p>
