<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4832节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4832.</strong>“犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶”表它沉浸在源于邪恶的虚假中。这从“珥”的代表和“长子”的含义清楚可知：“珥”和“长子”是指信之虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="4830.htm">4830</a>节）。该虚假是源于邪恶的虚假，这一点从前面所述（<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>节）明显可知。不过，对这个儿子来说，源于邪恶的虚假具有这样的性质：甚至连教会的代表也无法建在出身于他的任何后代当中；故经上说，他“在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华就叫他死了”。从一开始，尤其从犹大以后开始，源于邪恶的虚假就存在于那整个民族当中，尽管该虚假在犹大的儿子们当中各不相同。可以预见谁是那能用的，能用的，不是长子珥里面的东西，也不是次子俄南里面的东西，只能是示拉里面的东西。所以，头两个儿子都被除灭了，而第三个保存下来。源于邪恶的虚假从这个民族一开始就存在于整个民族当中，在摩西五经，经上以这些话清楚描述了这一点：<br />他们败坏自己，不是祂的儿女，这是他们的弊病；他们是乖僻弯曲的世代。耶和华因发怒便看见、斥责祂的众子和众女。祂说，我要向他们掩面，看他们的子孙如何；他们本是极乖僻的一代，没有忠信的儿女；我要将祸患堆在他们身上，把我的箭向他们射尽。他们必因饥饿消瘦，被燃烧的煤、惨烈的倾覆吞灭。他们是毫无计谋，心中没有聪明的民族。他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，蛾摩拉田园所生的。他们的葡萄是毒葡萄，全挂都是苦的。他们的酒是龙的毒气，是虺蛇残害的恶毒。这不都是积蓄在我这里，封锁在我府库中吗？他们遭灾的日子近了，那要临在他们身上的事，必速速来到。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.5.htm">32:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.19.htm">19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.32.htm">32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.35.htm">35</a>）<br />这些话在内义上描述了存在于这个民族当中并深深扎根在他们里面的源于邪恶的虚假，</p>

And Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah. That this signifies that he was in the falsity of evil, is evident from the representation of Er and the signification of the "firstborn," 
as being falsity of faith, of which just above (n. 4830). That this falsity was the falsity of evil, is evident from what was said above (n. 4818); but the falsity of evil in this son was of such a nature 
that not even a representative of a church could be instituted among any posterity from him; wherefore it is said that he was "evil in the eyes of Jehovah and Jehovah caused him to die." With that 
whole nation from its first origin, especially from Judah, there was falsity of evil, that is, false doctrine from evil of life, but different in one son of Judah from what it was in another. It was 
foreseen what might be serviceable, and that it was not that which was in Er the firstborn, nor that which was in Onan the second son, but only that which was in Shelah. Therefore the first two were 
destroyed, and the last was preserved. That falsity of evil was with that whole nation from its first origin is plainly described in Moses in these words: </p>
<p>     They have corrupted themselves, they are 
not His sons, it is their blemish; they are a perverse and crooked generation. And Jehovah saw and reprobated because of indignation His sons and His daughters. And He said, I will hide My faces from 
them, I will see what their posterity shall be; for they are a generation of perversities, sons in whom is no faithfulness; I will add evils upon them, I will spend Mine arrows upon them. They shall 
be exhausted with hunger, and consumed with burning coals, and bitter overthrow. They are a nation void of counsels, and there is no intelligence in them. Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the 
fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are of bitternesses; their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps. Is not this laid up in store with Me, sealed 
in My treasuries? The day of their destruction is at hand, and the things that are to come upon them make haste (Deut. 32:5, 19-24, 28, 32-35); </p>
<p>by these words in the internal sense is described the 
falsity of evil in which that nation was, and which was rooted in them. </p>

'And Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah' means that it was immersed in falsity springing from evil This is clear from the representation of 'Er' and from the meaning of 'firstborn' 
as falsity of faith, dealt with just above in <a href="4830.htm">4830</a>. Evidence that this falsity was falsity springing from evil is given in what has been stated above in <a href="4818.htm">4818</a>. But with this son the falsity springing 
from evil was of such a nature that not even that which was representative of the Church could be established among any who would have been descended from him, and therefore it is said that 'he was evil 
in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah caused him to die'. Among that whole nation - right from the start, and especially from Judah onwards - falsity springing from evil was present, that is, a false 
teaching that resulted from evil living, though that falsity was different with one son of Judah from what it was with another. Which of these could serve a purpose was foreseen, and this was not that 
existing with Er the firstborn; nor was it that with Onan the secondborn, but that existing with Shelah. Therefore those first two sons were destroyed, whereas this third was preserved. The existence 
among that whole nation, from when it first began, of falsity springing from evil is described plainly in Moses in the following words, </p>
<blockquote>
Self-corrupted; not his sons; the blemish is theirs; a perverse 
and crooked generation. When Jehovah saw, and rejected - with more than indignation - His sons and His daughters And He said, I will hide My face from them; I will see what their posterity will 
be, for they are a perverse generation, sons in whom there is no faithfulness. I will add evils upon them, I will expend My arrows on them; they will be exhausted with famine, and consumed with burning 
coal, and with bitter destruction They are a nation from whom counsel has perished, in whom there is no intelligence; from the vine of Sodom comes their vine, and from the ploughed fields of Gomorrah, 
their grapes are grapes of gall, their dusters are bitterness. The poison of dragons is their wine, and the cruel gall of asps. Is not this stored up with Me, sealed up in My treasures? The day of 
their destruction is near, and the things to come upon them are hastening on. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:5,%2010,%2020,%2023,%2024,%2028,%2032-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:5, 10, 20, 23, 24, 28, 32-35</a>.

<p>In the internal sense these words describe falsity springing from evil which existed 
among that nation, and the fact that this falsity was rooted deeply within them. </p>

`Et fuit Er primogenitus Jehudae malus in oculis Jehovae': </p>
<p>quod significet quod in falso mali, constat ex repraesentatione `Eri' et significatione `primogeniti' quod sit falsum fidei, de qua mox 
supra n. 4830; quod hoc falsum esset falsum mali, patet ab illis quae supra; n. 4818 dicta sunt; sed apud hunc filium {1} tale falsum mali ut ne quidem repraesentativum Ecclesiae apud aliquam posteritatem 
ex illo institui potuerit, quapropter dicitur (o)quod `malus in oculis Jehovae et mori fecit illum Jehovah'.  Apud totam illam gentem a prima origine imprimis a Jehudah, fuit falsum mali, hoc 
est, falsum doctrinale ex malo vitae, sed apud unum Jehudae filium aliter quam apud alterum, et {2} praevisum quodnam inservire posset, et quod non id quod apud Erum primogenitum, nec quod apud Onan 
secundo genitum, sed quod apud Shelah, quapropter bini illi exstincti sunt, et hic conservatus; quod apud totam illam gentem a prima origine fuerit falsum mali, describitur manifeste apud Mosen, his 
verbis,           Corrupit mihi, non filii Ipsius, macula eorum,      generatio perversa et contorta:  cum vidit Jehovah, et      reprobavit prae indignatione filios suos, et filias suas; </p>
<p> 
    et dixit, Occultabo facies Meas ab eis, videbo quid      posteritas eorum; nam generatio perversitatum illi, filii      in quibus non fidelitas:... addam super eos mala, tela      Mea consumam 
in eis, exhausti fame {3}, (o)et consumpti      anthrace {4}, et excidio amaro:... gens perdita consiliis      [ille], et nulla in illis intelligentia:... ex vite      Sodomae vitis eorum et ex arvis 
Amorae, uvae eorum uvae      fellis, botri amaritudinum illis: venenum draconum vinum      eorum, et fel aspidum crudele.  Nonne illud reconditum      {5} apud Me, obsignatum in thesauris Meis?... 
prope est      dies interitus eorum, et properant futura illis, Deut.      xxxii 5, 19, 20, 23, 24, 28, 32, 33, [34,] 35; </p>
<p>per illa verba in sensu interno describitur falsum mali in quo gens illa 
fuit, et quod illis irradicatum.      @1 i Jehudae$      @2 at$      @3 combusti$      @4 combusti pruna$      @5 absconditum$ </p>
