<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4033节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4033.</strong>“这样，后聚集起来的就归拉班”表这些事物，也就是这些强制性的事物被留下；“先聚集起来的就归雅各”表自发的事物，或那些出于自由的事物被联结起来。这从刚才所述（<a href="4029.htm">4029</a>，<a href="4031.htm">4031</a>节）清楚可知。强制性的事物在此是指那些没有被联结和无法被联结的事物；自发的事物是指那些已经被联结，以及诸如能被联结的事物。之所以也是指后者，是因为自发事物取决于情感及其性质。“拉班”及其“羊群”所表示的良善提供了上述用途后，就被分离出去。下一章就论述这种分离。</p>

And those that came together later were Laban's. That by this is signified that these compulsory things were left behind; and that by those that came together first were Jacob's is signified that things 
spontaneous, or those that are from freedom, were conjoined, is evident from what has been said just above (n. 4029, 4031). By compulsory things are here signified those that were not conjoined, and 
that could not be conjoined; and by things spontaneous are signified those that had been conjoined, and also such as could be conjoined. That the latter also are meant is because things spontaneous 
are according to the affections and their quality. After the good signified by "Laban" and his "flock" has subserved the uses spoken of above, it is then separated. This separation is treated of in the 
following chapter. </p>

<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 'Those which came together later were Laban's' means that these things were left behind, that is to say, those that were compulsory. 'And those which came together first were Jacob's' means that the 
spontaneous things - those which were from his freedom - were joined together. This is clear from what has been stated immediately above in <a href="4029.htm">4029</a>, <a href="4032.htm">4032</a>. By the things that were compulsory are meant in 
this case those that had not been joined together, and were incapable of being joined; and by the things that were spontaneous those that had been joined, and also such as were capable of being joined. 
The reason why the latter are meant as well is that affections and the essential nature of those affections make spontaneous things what they are. After the good meant by 'Laban and his flock' has 
served the uses described above it is separated. That separation is dealt with in the next chapter.

{1} `Et erat dein coeuntium Labani': quod significet quod illa relinquerentur, nempe coacta; `et primum coeuntium Jacobo' quod significet quod spontanea, seu quae ex libero suo, conjungerentur, constat 
ab illis quae mox supra n. 4029, 4032 dicta sunt: per coacta hic significantur quae non conjuncta fuerunt, nec conjungi potuerunt; et per spontanea illa quae conjuncta fuerunt, ut et talia qua conjungi 
potuerunt; quod etiam haec, est quia spontanea se habent secundum affectiones et earum quale.  Postquam bonum quod per `Labanem et ejus gregem' significatur, illis usibus, de quibus supra, {2}inserviverat, 
tunc separatur; de separatione agitur in capite sequente. @1 no n. 4032 occurs in A or I$ @2 inserviverit$ </p>
