<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5989节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5989.</strong>住在头顶上的极其诡诈的灵人曾选出一些使臣，把他们派到我这里，好叫他们以其诡诈流入我；但他们因犯了一个大错而大失所望。其中一个在变成使臣时，弯腰团拢，把自己折得如同一个卷，以拒绝他们流入他。他以这种方式摆脱了他们的控制。于是，他们选了另一个，但他们也无法迫使他说话，因为他比他们还诡诈。当他似乎把自己卷成螺旋形时，便证明了这一点。他以这种方式骗了他们。此外，恶灵并不总是从他们自己的团体中派出使臣；相反，他们会留心查看其他人当中有什么样的灵人，以及那些简单、顺从的灵人在哪里，他们会让这些灵人变成他们的使臣。他们通过把自己的思维引入他们所选中的这个使臣灵，向他灌输自己的情感和谬念而如此行；结果，他不再控制自己，或说不再是自己的主人，而是作为他们的一个使臣而服侍他们。有时，他意识不到这一点。</p>

The most deceitful, who are above the head, once took subjects and sent them forth to me, in order that they might flow in with their deceits; but they were much disappointed. One, when made a subject, 
writhed back and closed himself, and folded himself as in a roll, in order thus to reject the influx. In this way he extricated himself from them. Then they took another, but neither could they force 
him to speak, he being more deceitful than they, which he showed by rolling himself as it were into the form of a spiral. In this way they were cheated. Moreover evil spirits do not always send forth 
subjects from their own body, but observe what spirits are with others, and also where are those who are simple and obedient, and these they make their subjects. This is effected by directing their 
thoughts into the subject spirit, and infusing into him their own affections and persuasions, whereby he is no longer his own master, but serves them as a subject. Of this he is sometimes unaware. </p>

Very deceitful spirits who dwell overhead once chose for themselves certain subordinates and sent them to me so that they could enter me with their deceits; but they had made a big mistake. One, having 
been made their subordinate, bent back and pulled himself in, making himself like a roll, so as to repel their entry into him; and by doing this he extricated himself from their control. Then they 
chose another, but they could not force him to speak either. He was more deceitful than they, a fact he demonstrated when he appeared to roll himself up into a spiral shape. In this way he deceived them. 
Furthermore evil spirits do not always send out subordinates from their own number; instead they take note of exactly who the spirits are whom they see among others, and also where the simple and 
compliant ones are located, whom they then make their subordinates. They do this by channeling their own thoughts into the one they choose and by instilling their own affections and false convictions, 
as a result of which he is no longer in control of himself but serves them as their subordinate, sometimes without his being aware of it. </p>

</p><b>5989.</b>
Dolosissimi qui supra caput, sibi quondam subjecta assumebant, et ad me emittebant ut cum dolis suis influere possent, sed fallebantur valde; unus cum subjectum factus, retorsit se et {1} clausit, et 
se involvit quasi volumini, ut sic a se rejiceret influxum; ita ab illis extricavit se.  Alium dein sumebant sed nec poterant illum redigere ad loquendum, erat iis dolosior, quod manifestabat per quasi 
involutionem in formam helicis; ita delusi sunt. Praeterea mali spiritus non semper a suis emittunt subjecta, sed observant quinam spiritus sunt {2} apud alios, tum quoque ubinam loci qui sunt simplices 
et oboedientes, hos faciunt sibi subjecta, quod fit per quod cogitationes suas dirigant in illum, ac ei affectiones et persuasiones {3}suas infundant, inde sui juris non est amplius sed pro subjecto 
illis inservit; hoc quandoque (c)is nescit. @1 i quasi$ @2 i qui$ @3 infundunt$ </p>
