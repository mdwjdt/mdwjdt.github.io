<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3186节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3186.</strong>“我们的妹子啊，愿你作千万人的母”表对真理的情感无限结实。 这从“妹子”和“千万”的含义清楚可知：“妹子”，就是利百加，是指对真理的情感（参看<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>，<a href="3179.htm">3179</a>，<a href="3182.htm">3182</a>节）；“千万”是指无限结实，在此表示无限，因为所论述的主题是主，祂里面的每一个事物都是无限的。对人而言，情况是这样：良善不会在他身上结实，真理也不会增多，除非真理与良善在他的理性中联结，也就是他已经重生。因为这种时候，果实或后代才从合法或天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻而出。诚然，在此之前他所行的良善看似良善，真理也看似真理；但它们并不纯正，因为灵魂，也就是含有来自主的纯真在里面的良善，并在它们里面。因此，它们既不会在他里面激发任何情感，也不会给他带来幸福。伴随爱与仁的情感，连同幸福，就是灵魂；并且这情感被主赋予正在重生的人。<br />“千”表示大量，也表示无限（参看<a href="2575.htm">2575</a>节），“万”表示更多，而“千万”则表示还要多。这在其它经文也一样，如摩西五经：<br />约柜停住的时候，他就说，耶和华啊，求你回到以色列的千万人中。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.36.htm">10:36</a>）<br />此处“千万”也表无限，因为它论及主，主就是这里的耶和华。<br />耶和华从西乃上来，到他们那里；祂从巴兰山发出光辉，从万万圣者中来临。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.2.htm">33:2</a>）<br />此处“万万”也表无限。诗篇：<br />神的车辇累万盈千。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.17.htm">68:17</a>）<br />此处“神的车辇”表那些属于圣言和取自圣言的教义的事物；“累万盈千”表其中的无限事物。启示录：<br />我又看见，且听见宝座周围有许多天使的声音；他们的数目有千千万万。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.11.htm">5:11</a>）<br />这表示他们数不胜数。</p>

Our sister, be thou for thousands of ten thousands. That this signifies the fructification of the affection of truth to infinitude, appears from the signification of "sister," who is Rebekah, as being 
the affection of truth (see n. 3077, 3179, 3182); and from the signification of "being for thousands of ten thousands," as being fructification to infinitude; "thousands of ten thousands" here denote 
what is infinite, because the subject treated of is the Lord, in whom all things both in general and in particular are infinite. With man the case is this: Goods are not fructified and truths are not 
multiplied with him, until the conjunction of truth and of good has been effected in his rational, that is, until he is regenerate; for then the fruits or offspring come forth from legitimate or heavenly 
marriage, which is that of good and truth. It is true that previously to this time the goods which he does appear as if they were goods and the truths appear as if they were truths; but they are 
not genuine, for the very soul, which is good wherein is innocence from the Lord, is not in them; thus neither do they affect the man and make him happy. The affection of love and of charity, together 
with the happiness thereof, which affection is the soul, is given of the Lord when man is being regenerated. [2] That by "thousands" is signified much, and also what is infinite, may be seen above 
(n. 2575); and still more by "ten thousands," and still more by "thousands of ten thousands," as also in other passages. Thus in Moses: </p>
<p>     When the ark rested, he said, Return Jehovah, the ten thousands 
of the thousands of Israel (Num. 10:36); </p>
<p>where by "the ten thousands of the thousands" is also signified what is infinite, because it is predicated of the Lord, who is here "Jehovah." Again: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah rose from Seir unto them; He shone forth from Mount Paran, and came from the ten thousands of holiness (Deut. 33:2); </p>
<p>where "ten thousands" also denote what is infinite. In David: </p>
<p>     The 
chariots of God are ten thousands of thousands of peaceable ones (Ps. 68:17); </p>
<p>where the "chariots of God" denote those things which are of the Word and of the doctrine thence derived; "ten thousands 
of thousands" denote the infinite things which are therein. In John: </p>
<p>     I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne; their number was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands 
of thousands (Rev. 5:11); </p>
<p>denoting that they were innumerable. </p>

'Our sister, may you become thousands of myriads' means infinite fruitfulness of the affection for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'sister', who is Rebekah, as the affection for truth, dealt 
with in <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, <a href="3179.htm">3179</a>, <a href="3182.htm">3182</a>, and from the meaning of 'may you become thousands of myriads' as infinite fruitfulness. Here 'thousands of myriads' means that which is infinite because the subject is the Lord 
in whom every single thing is infinite. With man the situation is that goods are not fruitful with him and truths are not multiplied until truth and good have become joined together in his rational, 
that is, until he has been regenerated. For at that point fruits or offspring from the rightful or heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of good and truth, come into being. Prior to this the goods 
which he puts into practice, it is true, look like goods, and truths like truths; but these are not genuine, since the soul which is good that has innocence from the Lord within it is not present in 
them. Thus they do not stir any affection in him nor do they bring him happiness. The affection that accompanies love and charity, together with happiness, is the soul, and that affection is imparted 
by the Lord to a person when being regenerated. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 'A thousand' meaning much, also that which is infinite - see <a href="2575.htm">2575</a> - 'a myriad' means that which is even more, and 'thousands of myriads' that which 
is even more again, as also elsewhere. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
When the Ark came to rest he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10:36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'the myriads of thousands' 
means that which is infinite because it has reference to the Lord, who is Jehovah here. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah dawned from Seir upon them, He shone from Mount Paran, and came out of myriads 
of holiness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Myriads' again stands for that which is infinite. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
The chariots of God are myriads of thousands of peacemakers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The chariots of God' stands 
for things which belong to the Word and to doctrine drawn from it, 'myriads of thousands' for infinite things present there. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, 
numbering myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for the fact that they were countless. </p>

</p><b>3186.</b>
`Soror nostra tu sis in millia myriadis': quod significet affectionis veri fructificationem in infinitum, constat ex significatione `sororis' quae Rebecca, quod sit affectio veri, de qua n. 3077, 3179, 
3182, et a significatione `sis in millia myriadis' quod sit fructificatio in infinitum; `millia myriadis' hic sunt infinitum quia agitur de Domino, in Quo omnia et singula sunt infinita: apud hominem 
se habet ita: non prius fructificantur bona ac multiplicantur vera apud illum, quam cum conjunctio facta veri et boni in rationali ejus, hoc est, cum regeneratus, tunc enim fructus seu foetus ex legitimo 
seu caelesti conjugio quod est boni et veri, existunt; prius quidem apparent bona quae facit, etiam sicut bona, et vera sicut vera, sed non sunt genuina, nam ipsa anima quae est bonum in quo innocentia 
a Domino, non inest, ita nec afficiunt hominem et faciunt illum felicem; affectio amoris et charitatis cum felici quae anima, datur a Domino cum regeneratur homo. [2] Quod per `mille' significetur 
multum, tum infinitum, videatur n. 2575, magis adhuc per `myriadem,' et adhuc magis per `millia myriadis,' ut quoque alibi; apud Mosen,           Cum quiescebat arca, dixit, Redi Jehovah, myriades  
    millium Israelis, Num. x 36; </p>
<p>ubi per `myriades millium' etiam significatur infinitum, quia praedicatur de Domino, Qui ibi Jehovah: (m)apud eundem,           Jehovah exortus de Seir illis, 
exsplenduit de monte      Paran, et venit ex myriadibus sanctitatis, Deut. xxxiii 2; </p>
<p>`myriades' etiam pro infinito(n): apud Davidem,           Currus Dei myriades millium pacificorum, Ps. lxviii 18 [A.V. 
17]: </p>
<p>`currus Dei' pro illis quae sunt Verbi ac inde doctrinae, `myriades millium' pro infinitis quae ibi: apud Johannem,           Vidi et audivi vocem angelorum multorum circa thronum,   
   erat numerus illorum myriades myriadum, et chiliades      chiliadum, Apoc. v 11; </p>
<p>pro innumerabilibus. </p>
