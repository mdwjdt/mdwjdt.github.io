<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8478节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8478.</strong>“所收的，不许什么人留到早晨”表他们绝不可以忧虑从自己那里获得它。这从以下事实清楚可知：吗哪每天早晨被赐下，而虫子是在剩下的东西中生出的，以此表示主每天提供人们所需的，因此，他们不必忧虑从自己那里获得它们。这一点也由主祷文中“日用的饮食”，以及主在马太福音中的话来表示：<br />不要为你们的灵魂忧虑吃什么，喝什么；为你们的身体忧虑穿什么。何必为衣裳忧虑呢？你想，野地里的百合花怎么长起来。它也不劳苦，也不纺线。所以，不要忧虑说，吃什么？喝什么？穿什么？这都是外邦人所求的。你们需用的这一切东西，你们的天父会不知道吗？你们要先求天国和祂的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。所以，不要为明天忧虑，因为明天自有明天的忧虑。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.25.htm">6:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.31.htm">31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.34.htm">34</a>）<br />这些话同样出现在路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.11.htm">12:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.22.htm">22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.31.htm">31</a>）。<br />本节和接下来的几节在内义上论述的是对明天的忧虑，这种忧虑不仅被禁止，还受到谴责。他们不可将吗哪留到早晨表示它被禁止，虫子在他们所留下的里面生出并发臭表示它受到谴责。凡看待这个问题的深度没有超过字义的人可能以为对明天的一切忧虑都要抛弃，因而要每天等候从天上来的生活必需品。但是，人若从比字义更深的角度，也就是从内义来看待这个问题，就能知道“为明天忧虑”是什么意思。这句话不是说为自己获得衣食，以及未来的资源而忧虑；因为人为自己和家属做准备并不违反秩序。但当人们不满足于自己那一分，不信靠神而是信靠自己，只关注世俗和地上的事物，不关注天上的事物时，他们就有对明天的忧虑了。这些人完全被对未来的忧虑和对拥有一切并掌控所有人的欲望主宰。这种欲望被点燃，并烧得越来越旺，直到最后到了无法估量的地步。他们若达不到自己所渴望的目标，就会悲伤，也会为失去它们而感到极度痛苦。他们也找不到安慰，因为在失去的时候，他们向神性发怒。他们弃绝神性，连同信的一切，诅咒自己。这就是那些为明天忧虑之人的样子。<br />那些信靠神性的人则完全不同。这些人虽然也关心明天，但毫无忧虑，因为他们思想明天时并不担心，更不用说焦虑了。他们无论是否达到自己渴望的目标，都会心平气和；他们不会为失去而悲伤，而是满足于自己那一分。他们若变得富有，不会迷恋财富或心系财富；若提拔到重要位置，也不认为自己比别人更有价值；若变得贫穷，不会悲哀；若地位低下，也不垂头丧气。他们知道，对那些信靠神性的人来说，一切事都在朝一个永恒的幸福状态发展，无论什么时候，无论他们遇到什么样的事，都有助于这个状态。<br />要知道，神性治理是普世的或全面的，也就是说，它存在于最小的细节里面；处于圣治或天命溪流的人正不断朝更幸福的事迈进，无论表面上看，手段会是什么。那些信靠神性，并将一切归于祂的人处于圣治或天命的溪流；而那些只信靠自己，并将一切归于自己的人则未处于圣治或天命的溪流；他们的观点是相反的，因为他们将圣治或天命从神性那里夺走，并声称它是他们自己的。还要知道，人在何等程度上处于圣治或天命的溪流，就在何等程度上处于平安的状态；在何等程度上凭信之良善处于平安的状态，就在何等程度上处于圣治或天命之中。唯独这些人知道并相信，主的圣治或天命在每一个事物里面，事实上在最小的细节中，如前所示（<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="4329.htm">4329</a>，<a href="5122.htm">5122</a>e，<a href="5894.htm">5894</a>，<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>，<a href="6481.htm">6481</a>-<a href="6486.htm">6486</a>，<a href="6490.htm">6490</a>，<a href="7004.htm">7004</a>，<a href="7007.htm">7007</a>节），圣治或天命关注永恒之物（<a href="6491.htm">6491</a>节）。<br />但持相反观点的人几乎不愿听见有人提及圣治或天命，因为他们将一切都归因于自己的精明，不能归因于此的，就归因于运气或意外：有的把它归因于命运，他们将命运归因于自然的力量，而非归因于神性。他们把那些不将一切归因于自己或自然力量的人称为简单人。由此再次看出那些为明天忧虑的人是何性质，而那些不为明天忧虑的人又是何性质。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8478</b></p><p><b>8478.</b>
Let no one make a residue of it till the morning. That this signifies that they should not be solicitous about acquiring it from themselves, is evident from the fact that the manna was to be given every 
morning, and that worms would be bred in that which was left over, by which is signified that the Lord daily provides necessaries, and that therefore they ought not to be solicitous about acquiring 
them from themselves. This also is meant by the "daily bread" in the Lord's Prayer, and likewise by the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Be not solicitous for your soul, what ye shall eat, or what ye 
shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on; why are ye solicitous about things to put on? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: therefore 
be ye not solicitous, saying, What shall we eat? and what shall we drink? or, wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the nations seek; doth not your Heavenly Father know that ye 
have need of all these things? Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens, and His righteousness; then shall all these things be added to you; therefore be ye not solicitous for the morrow, for the morrow 
will take care of the things of itself (6:25, 28, 31-34). In like manner in Luke 12:11, 12, 22-31.  [2] As in this and the following verses in the internal sense care for the morrow is treated 
of, and as this care is not only forbidden, but is also condemned (that it is forbidden is signified by that they were not to make a residue of the manna till the morning, and that it is condemned is 
signified by that the worm was bred in the residue, and it stank), he who looks at the subject no deeper than from the sense of the letter may believe that all care for the morrow is to be cast aside, 
and thus that the necessaries of life are to be awaited daily from heaven; but he who looks at the subject deeper than from the letter, as for instance he who looks at it from the internal sense, is 
able to know what is meant by "care for the morrow." It does not mean the care of procuring for oneself food and raiment, and even resources for the time to come; for it is not contrary to order for anyone 
to be provident for himself and his own. But those have care for the morrow who are not content with their lot; who do not trust in the Divine, but in themselves; and who have regard for only worldly 
and earthly things, and not for heavenly things. With such there universally reigns solicitude about things to come, and a desire to possess all things and to dominate over all, which is kindled 
and grows according to the additions thus made, and finally does so beyond all measure. They grieve if they do not obtain the objects of their desire, and feel anguish at the loss of them; and they have 
no consolation, because of the anger they feel against the Divine, which they reject together with everything of faith, and curse themselves. Such are they who have care for the morrow.  [3] Very 
different is the case with those who trust in the Divine. These, notwithstanding they have care for the morrow, still have it not, because they do not think of the morrow with solicitude, still less 
with anxiety. Unruffled is their spirit whether they obtain the objects of their desire, or not; and they do not grieve over the loss of them, being content with their lot. If they become rich, they do 
not set their hearts on riches; if they are raised to honors, they do not regard themselves as more worthy than others; if they become poor, they are not made sad; if their circumstances are mean, they 
are not dejected. They know that for those who trust in the Divine all things advance toward a happy state to eternity, and that whatever befalls them in time is still conducive thereto.  [4] Be 
it known that the Divine Providence is universal, that is, in things the most minute; and that they who are in the stream of Providence are all the time carried along toward everything that is happy, 
whatever may be the appearance of the means; and that those are in the stream of Providence who put their trust in the Divine and attribute all things to Him; and that those are not in the stream of Providence 
who trust in themselves alone and attribute all things to themselves, because they are in the opposite, for they take away providence from the Divine, and claim it for themselves. Be it known 
also that insofar as anyone is in the stream of Providence, so far he is in a state of peace; also that insofar as anyone is in a state of peace from the good of faith, so far he is in the Divine Providence. 
These alone know and believe that the Divine Providence of the Lord is in everything both in general and in particular, nay, is in the most minute things of all (as may be seen shown above, 
n. 1919, 4329, 5122, 5894, 6058, 6481-6486, 6490, 7004, 7007), and that the Divine Providence regards what is eternal (n. 6491).  [5] But they who are in the opposite are scarcely willing to hear Providence 
mentioned, for they ascribe everything to their own sagacity; and what they do not ascribe to this they ascribe to fortune or chance; some to fate, which they do not educe from the Divine, but 
from nature. They call those simple who do not attribute all things to themselves or to nature. From all this again it can be seen what is the quality of those who have care for the morrow, and what 
the quality of those who have no care for the morrow. </p>

'Let no one leave any of it until the morning' means that they must not be anxious to acquire it of themselves. This is clear from the fact that the manna was given every morning and that worms bred 
in what was left over, meaning that the Lord provides people's requirements every day and that for this reason they ought not to be anxious to acquire them of themselves. The same thing is meant by daily 
bread in the Lord's Prayer and also by the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not be anxious for your soul, what you are going to eat or what you are going to drink, nor for your body, what you are going 
to put on. Why be anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, nor do they spin. Do not therefore be anxious, so that you say, What shall we eat? or What 
shall we drink? or What shall we wear? For all these things the gentiles seek. Does not your heavenly Father know that you have need of all these things? Seek first the kingdom of God<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and its righteousness, 
then all these things will be added to you. Do not therefore be anxious about the morrow; for the morrow will take care of the things that belong to it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:25-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:25-end</a>.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The present verse and the one that follows refer in the internal sense to concern for the morrow, a concern which was not only forbidden but also condemned. The forbiddance 
of it is meant by their being told not to leave any of the manna till the morning, and the condemnation of it is meant by worms breeding in any they did leave and its becoming putrid. Anyone 
who does not view the matter from anywhere beyond the sense of the letter may think that all concern for the morrow is to be avoided, which being so, people should then await their requirements every 
day from heaven. But a person who views it from a position deeper than the literal meaning, that is, who views it from the internal sense, may recognize what concern for the morrow is used to mean - 
not concern to obtain food and clothing for oneself, and also resources for the future; for it is not contrary to order to make provision for oneself and one's dependents. But people are concerned about 
the morrow when they are not content with their lot, do not trust in God but in themselves, and have solely worldly and earthly things in view, not heavenly ones. These people are ruled completely 
by anxiety over the future, and by the desire to possess all things and exercise control over all other people. That desire is kindled and grows greater and greater, till at length it is beyond all measure. 
They grieve if they do not realize the objects of their desires, and they are distressed at the loss of them. Nor can they find consolation, for in times of loss they are angry with the Divine. 
They reject Him together with all belief, and curse themselves. This is what those concerned for the morrow are like. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Those who trust in the Divine are altogether different. Though concerned about 
the morrow, yet are they unconcerned, in that they are not anxious, let alone worried, when they give thought to the morrow. They remain even-tempered whether or not they realize desires, and they 
do not grieve over loss; they are content with their lot. If they become wealthy they do not become infatuated with wealth; if they are promoted to important positions they do not consider themselves 
worthier than others. If they become poor they are not made miserable either; if lowly in status they do not feel downcast. They know that for those who trust in the Divine all things are moving towards 
an everlasting state of happiness, and that no matter what happens at any time to them, it contributes to that state. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It should be recognized that Divine providence is overall, that is, it 
is present within the smallest details of all, and that people in the stream of providence are being carried along constantly towards happier things, whatever appearance the means may present. Those 
in the stream of providence are people who trust in the Divine and ascribe everything to Him. But those not in the stream of providence are people who trust in themselves alone and attribute everything 
to themselves; theirs is a contrary outlook, for they take providence away from the Divine and claim it as their own. It should be recognized also that to the extent that anyone is in the stream of 
providence he is in a state of peace; and to the extent that anyone is in a state of peace by virtue of the good of faith, he is in Divine providence. These alone know and believe that the Lord's Divine 
providence resides within every single thing, indeed within the smallest details of all, as has also been shown in <a href="1919.htm">1919</a> (end), <a href="4329.htm">4329</a>, <a href="5122.htm">5122</a> (end), <a href="5894.htm">5894</a> (end), <a href="6058.htm">6058</a>, <a href="6481.htm">6481</a>-<a href="6486.htm">6486</a>, <a href="6490.htm">6490</a>, <a href="7004.htm">7004</a>, <a href="7007.htm">7007</a>, as well 
as that Divine providence has what is eternal in view, <a href="6491.htm">6491</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Those with the contrary outlook are scarcely willing to allow any mention of providence. Instead they put every single thing down 
to prudence; and what they do not put down to prudence they put down to fortune or to chance. Some put it down to fate, which they do not ascribe to the Divine but to natural forces. They call those 
people simple who do not attribute all things to themselves or to natural forces. From all this one may again see what those people are like who are concerned for the morrow, and what those are like who 
are not concerned for the morrow.

`Quisque ne residuum faciat de illo usque ad mane': quod significet quod non solliciti erunt de ejus acquisitione ex se, constat ex eo quod manna quovis mane daretur, et quod residuo {1}innascerentur 
vermes, per quae significatur quod Dominus quotidie provideat necessitates, et quod sic ex se de {2}illarum acquisitione non solliciti esse debeant; hoc quoque {3}intelligitur per panem quotidianum 
in Oratione Domini, et quoque per Domini verba apud Matthaeum, Ne solliciti sitis animae vestrae quid esuri sitis aut bibituri, neque corpori vestro quid induituri: quid de indumentis solliciti estis? 
considerate lilia agri quomodo crescunt; non laborant, neque nent: ne itaque solliciti sitis, {4} ut dicatis, Quid edemus? {5}aut, Quid bibemus? aut, Quo induemur? nam ista omnia gentes quaerunt; nonne 
Pater vester caelestis novit quod opus habeatis his omnibus? quaerite {6}primum regnum caelorum ejusque justitiam, tunc haec omnia adjicientur vobis; ne sitis igitur solliciti in crastinum, nam crastinus 
dies {7}curam habebit illorum quae illius sunt, vi 25-fin.; </p>
<p>pariter apud Lucam xii 11, 12, 22-31. 	2 Quia in hoc versu et in sequente agitur in sensu interno de cura pro crastino, et quod illa 
cura non solum prohibita sit, sed etiam damnata; quod prohibita, significatur per quod de manna non residuum facerent ad {8}mane, et quod damnata, significatur per quod residuo innatus sit vermis, 
et id computruerit; qui rem non ultra quam ex sensu litterae intuetur, credere potest quod omnis cura pro crastino abjicienda sit, et sic quod necessitates quotidie ex caelo (x)exspectandae {9}; sed qui 
rem altius quam ex littera intuetur, ut qui ex sensu interno, scire potest quid per curam (x)crastini intelligitur; non intelligitur cura comparandi sibi victum et amictum, et quoque facultates pro 
tempore venturo, nam non contra ordinem {10} est prospicere sibi et suis; sed illi curam crastini habent qui non sunt contenti sua sorte, qui non fidunt Divino sed sibi, quique spectant solum ad mundana 
et terrestria, et non ad caelestia; apud hos universaliter regnat sollicitudo de futuris, cupido possidendi omnia et dominandi super omnes, quae accenditur et crescit secundum incrementa, et tandem 
supra omnem modum; hi dolent si cupitis non potiuntur, et anguntur cum illorum jacturam faciunt; nec consolatio, nam tunc irascuntur contra Divinum; rejiciunt id una cum omni fidei, seque devovent; 
tales sunt apud quos cura crastini est. 	3 Aliter prorsus apud illos qui fidunt Divino; hi tametsi curam {11}pro crastino habent, usque tamen non habent, nam de crastino non cogitant cum sollicitudine, 
minus cum anxietate; aequo animo sunt sive potiantur cupitis sive non, ad jacturam nec dolent, sunt contenti sua sorte; si opulenti fiunt, non in opulentia ponunt cor; si ad honores evehuntur, non 
se aliis digniores spectant; si pauperes fiunt, nec contristantur; si viles conditione, non dejiciunt animum; sciunt quod illis qui fidunt Divino, omnia succedant ad {12}statum felicem in aeternum, et 
quod quae illis in tempore {13}eveniunt, usque ad illum conducant. 	4 Sciendum {14} quod providentia Divina sit universalis, hoc est, in singularissimis omnium, et quod qui in providentiae flumine {15}sunt 
{16}ferantur continue ad felicia, qualitercumque media apparent; et quod illi in providentiae flumine sint, qui fidunt Divino, Ipsique tribuunt omnia; et quod illi non in providentiae flumine 
sint, qui sibi solis fidunt, sibique tribuunt omnia, sunt enim in opposito, nam providentiam Divino derogant, et illam sibi vindicant; sciendum etiam quod quantum quis in providentiae flumine est, tantam 
sit in statu pacis, tum quantum quis in statu {17}pacis est ex bono fidei, tantum {18} in {19}pro videntia Divina sit; hi solum sciunt et credunt quod providentia Divina Domini sit in omnibus et singulis,
