<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3132节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3132.</strong>“他已经看见环子，又看见镯子在他妹子的手上”表当发现神圣良善与神圣真理就在“妹子”所表示的真理情感的能力中时。这从“看见”、“环子”、“镯子”、“手”和“妹子”的含义清楚可知：“看见”是指发现（<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>节）；“环子”是指神圣良善（参看<a href="3103.htm">3103</a>，<a href="3104.htm">3104</a>节）；“镯子”是指神圣真理（参看<a href="3103.htm">3103</a>，<a href="3105.htm">3105</a>节）；“手”是指能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>节）；“妹子”是指对真理的情感（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2524.htm">2524</a>，<a href="2556.htm">2556</a>节）。从这些章节明显可知，“看见环子，又看见镯子在他妹子的手上”意思是，发现神圣良善与神圣真理就在对真理的情感的能力中。<br />这个问题的真相是这样：主里面神圣良善与神圣真理的结合就是神性婚姻本身，天上的婚姻就源于该婚姻；神性婚姻同样是良善与真理的婚姻，婚姻之爱也源于神性婚姻（参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）。所以，在圣言中，哪里论述婚姻，就内义而言，哪里所指的就是天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻；就至高义而言，就是主里面的神性婚姻。因此，以撒和利百加之间的婚姻在此并非表示别的。良善与真理的结合就是婚姻本身，而一个被引入另一个是订婚，或婚前的状态。在这种状态下，由于它在订婚少女的能力中，并且随后妻子要与丈夫结合，故它就在要被引入神圣真理，并因此与神圣良善联结的真理情感的能力中。而且，对主来说，神圣良善本身和神圣真理本身最内在地存在于对真理的最初情感中，之后存在于对它的一切情感中。因为耶和华自己就存在于那里。这就是此处所论述的能力的源头。</p>

And it came to pass when he saw the jewel, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands. That this signifies when it was observed that Divine good and Divine truth were in the power of the affection of 
truth, which is the "sister," is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to observe (n. 2150); from the signification of the "jewel," as being Divine good (see n. 3103, 3105); from the signification 
of "bracelets," as being Divine truth (see n. 3103, 3105) from the signification of "hands," as being power (see above, n. 878, 3091); and from the signification of "sister," as being the 
affection of truth (see n. 2508, 2524, 2556); from all which it is evident that to "see the jewel and the bracelets upon his sister's hands," is to observe that Divine good and Divine truth were in the 
power of the affection of truth.  [2] The case herein is this: The conjunction of Divine good and Divine truth in the Lord is the very Divine marriage from which is the heavenly marriage, which is 
likewise a marriage of good and truth; from this also comes conjugial love (see n. 2727-2759). Hence it is that where marriage is treated of in the Word, in the internal sense there is signified the heavenly 
marriage, which is that of good and truth; and in the supreme sense the Divine marriage, which is in the Lord; wherefore nothing else is here meant by the marriage between Isaac and Rebekah. The 
conjunction of good and truth is the marriage itself, but the initiation is the betrothal, or the state preceding marriage. But the state that precedes betrothal is what is here described. As in this 
state it is within the power of the damsel to be betrothed, and afterwards as a wife to be conjoined with a husband, so it is within the power of the affection of truth to be initiated into Divine 
truth, and in this manner to be conjoined with Divine good. And further: in the first affection and afterwards in every affection of truth with the Lord, there was inmostly the Divine good itself and 
the Divine truth itself, because there was Jehovah Himself; from this came the power that is here treated of. </p>

'And so it was, when he saw the nose-jewel and the bracelets on his sister's hands' means when it recognized Divine Good and Divine Truth within the power of the affection for truth, meant by 'a sister'. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as recognizing, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, from the meaning of 'a nose-jewel' as Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="3103.htm">3103</a>, <a href="3104.htm">3104</a>, from the meaning of 'bracelets' as Divine 
Truth, also dealt with in <a href="3103.htm">3103</a>, <a href="3105.htm">3105</a>, from the meaning of 'hands' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, and from the meaning of 'a sister' as the affection for truth, dealt with in <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2524.htm">2524</a>, <a href="2556.htm">2556</a>. From 
these paragraphs it is evident that 'seeing the nose-jewel and the bracelets on his sister's hands' means recognizing Divine Good and Divine Truth within the power of the affection for truth. </p>

The truth of the matter is that Divine Good and Divine Truth joined together within the Lord constitute the Divine marriage itself, from which the heavenly marriage springs, which in a similar way 
is a marriage of good and truth. From this too conjugial love springs, see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>. Consequently when a marriage is the subject in the Word the heavenly marriage is meant in the internal sense, which 
is the marriage of good and truth, and in the highest sense the Divine marriage which exists within the Lord. For this reason nothing else is meant here by the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah. The marriage 
itself exists when good and truth have been joined together, but the betrothal of the two, or the state preceding the marriage, when one is being introduced into the other. But it is the state preceding 
the betrothal that is described here. In this state, as it is in the power of a [marriageable] girl to become betrothed, and subsequently as a wife to be joined to a husband, so it is in the 
power of the affection for truth to be introduced into Divine Truth and so to be joined to Divine Good. What is more, in the initial affection for truth and after that in every affection for it, with 
the Lord, Divine Good itself and Divine Truth itself were inmostly present because Jehovah Himself was present there. This was the source of the power which is the subject here. </p>

`Et fuit, ut videre monile et armillas super manibus sororis suae': quod significet cum apperciperet Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum in potentia affectionis veri, quae est `soror,' constat a significatione 
`videre' quod sit appercipere, de qua n. 2150; ex significatione `monilis' quod sit Divinum Bonum, de qua n. 3103, 3104; ex significatione `armillarum' quod sit Divinum Verum, de qua etiam n. 3103, 
(x)3104; ex significatione `manuum' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878, 3091; et ex significatione `sororis' quod sit affectio veri, de qua n. 2508, 2524, 2556; ex quibus patet quod `videre monile 
et armillas super manibus sororis suae' sit appercipere Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum in potentia affectionis veri. Hoc ita se habet: [2] conjunctio Divini Boni et Divini Veri in Domino est ipsum conjugium 
Divinum, ex quo conjugium caeleste, quod similiter est boni et veri, ex illo etiam est amor conjugialis, videatur n. 2727-2759; inde est, ubi in Verbo agitur de conjugio, quod in sensu interno 
significetur conjugium caeleste, quod est boni et veri, ac in supremo sensu conjugium Divinum quod in Domino; quapropter hic per conjugium inter {1}Jishakum et Rebeccam non aliud intelligitur; {2}conjunctio 
boni et veri est ipsum conjugium, initiatio autem est desponsatio, seu status praecedens conjugium; at status praecedens desponsationem, est qui hic describitur; in hoc statu, sicut in potentia 
puellae est desponsari, et dein {3}ut uxor conjungi marito, ita in potentia affectionis veri est initiari Divino Vero, et sic conjungi Divino Bono: (m)et praeterea in prima et dein in omni affectione 
veri apud Dominum, erat intime ipsum Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, quia Ipse Jehovah, inde potentia, de qua hic agitur.(n) @1 Isacum$  @2 i ipsa$  @3 sicut$  </p>
