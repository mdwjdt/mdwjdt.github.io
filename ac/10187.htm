<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10187节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10187</strong>.“又要在周围给坛镶上金边”表良善的边界，免得它们被邪恶靠近并伤害。这从“边”和“金”的含义清楚可知：“边”是指一个边界，用来防止邪恶靠近并造成伤害（参看<a href="9492.htm">9492</a>节）；“金”是指良善（<a href="9874.htm">9874</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>节）。边之所以用金子来镶，是因为它代表良善的封闭带；事实上，邪恶不能靠近良善，因为邪恶绝无可能承受得住良善的气场。当邪恶，确切地说那些沉浸于邪恶的人，也就是那些来自地狱的人进入这个气场，即天堂的气场时，他们会经历可怕的折磨和痛苦。他们越深入这个气场，就越感受到自己里面那种地狱般的折磨，结果变得像那些垂死挣扎的人。所以他们立刻坠入地狱，再也不敢抬头。这就是天堂里的人受到保护，免受来自地狱的邪恶侵扰的原因；这也是亚伯拉罕对地狱里的财主所说这些话的意思：<br />在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.26.htm">16:26</a>）<br />以及这些话的意思：<br />他们要向群山和磐石说，倒在我们身上吧！把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的脸面和羔羊的忿怒。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.16.htm">6:16</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.8.htm">10:8</a>）<br />但至于真理，恶人能靠近真理，因为恶人会通过错误的解释来歪曲真理，从而用它们来支持自己的恶欲。不过，在良善存在于真理里面的程度内，真理是无法被靠近的。由此可见在来世，那些仅处于被称为信之真理的真理，同时却未处于良善的人能得到的是哪种保护。良善是指对邻之仁和对主之爱，因为一切良善都来自这个源头。由此明显可知为何在香坛的壁周围镶上金边。</p>

And thou shalt make for it a border of gold round it. That this signifies a bounding from good lest they be approached and injured by evils, is evident from the signification of "a border," as being 
a bounding to prevent approach and injury by evils (see n. 9492); and from the signification of "gold," as being good (n. 9874, 9881). The reason why the border was made of gold was because it represented 
a closure from good; for good cannot be approached by evils, because evils cannot by any means endure the sphere of good; when evils, that is, those who are in evils, or those who are from hell, 
come unto this sphere, which is the sphere of heaven, they are direfully tortured, and insofar as they enter into this sphere, so far they feel infernal torments within them, and consequently become like 
those who are lying in the death agony; and therefore they instantly cast themselves down into hell, and no longer dare to lift up their heads. This is the reason why those who are in heaven are in 
safety from the infestation of evils from the hells; and this is meant by the words of Abraham to the rich man who was in hell: </p>
<p>     Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they who would 
pass over from hence to you cannot, neither can they who are there pass over to us (Luke 16:26); </p>
<p>and by these words: </p>
<p>     They shall say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us 
from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb (Rev. 6:6; Hosea 10:8). But as regards truth, this can be approached by the evil, because the evil pervert truths by 
wrong interpretations, and so apply them to favor their own cupidities; but in proportion as good is present in truths, truths cannot be approached. From this it can be seen what kind of protection is 
possible in the other life to those who are solely in truths, which are called the truths of faith, and not at the same time in good. By good is meant charity toward the neighbor and love to the Lord, 
for all goods are from this source. From all this it is now evident why a border was made round about the sides of the altar of incense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10187</b></p><p><b>10187.</b>
'And you shall make [for it] a rim of gold round about' means a border of good, serving to defend them from the approach of evils and the harm these can do. This is clear from the meaning of 'a rim' 
as a border serving to defend and from the approach of evils and the harm these can do, dealt with in <a href="9492.htm">9492</a>; and from the meaning of 'gold' as good, dealt with in <a href="9874.htm">9874</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>. The reason why the rim was 
made from gold was that it represented an enclosing band of good; for good cannot be approached by evils, indeed evils cannot by any means abide a sphere of good. When evils, or rather those who are 
steeped in evils, that is, those who come from hell, enter that sphere, which is a heavenly sphere, they experience dreadful pain. The further they go into that sphere, the more they inwardly undergo 
hellish torments, and as a consequence become like those lying in the throes of death. Therefore they hurl themselves straightaway into hell and do not dare any longer to raise their head. This is the 
reason why those in heaven are protected from molestation by evils that come from hell. This is how to understand Abraham's words to the rich man in hell,  </p>
<blockquote>
Between us and you there is a great gulf 
fixed, so that those who want to pass across from here to you cannot, nor can those who are there pass across to us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Also the following words,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will say to the mountains and rocks, 
Rush down on us and hide us from the face of Him who is seated on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:16</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2010:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 10:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>But as regards truth, this can be approached by those who 
are evil, because the evil pervert truths by means of wrong interpretations, and so use them to support their evil desires. But to the extent that good is present within truths, truths cannot be approached. 
This shows what [little] protection those in the next life can have with whom solely truths, called the truths of faith, are present and not good at the same time. By good, charity towards the 
neighbour and love to the Lord should be understood, since these are the source of all good.  From all this it is now evident why a rim of gold was made round about the walls of the altar of incense.  </p>

`Et facies [ei] limbum auri circumcirca': quod significet terminationem ex bono ne adeantur et laedantur a malis, constat ex significatione `limbi' quod sit terminatio ne adeantur et laedantur malis, 
de qua n. 9492, et ex significatione `auri' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 9874, (x)9881. Quod limbus ex auro factus fuerit, erat quia repraesentabat clausuram ex bono, bonum enim non potest adiri a malis, 
nam mala non sustinent ullo modo sphaeram boni; cum {1} mala, hoc est, {2} illi qui in malis sunt, seu qui ab inferno, in illam sphaeram veniunt, quae sphaera est sphaera caeli, dire anguntur, et quantum 
in illam sphaeram intrant, tantum infernales cruciatus in se sentiunt, et fiunt inde sicut illi qui in agone mortis jacent, quapropter dejiciunt se actutum in infernum, et non audent amplius elevare 
caput; haec causa est quod qui in caelo sunt, 3 in tu {3} in tuto sint ab infestatione malorum quae ab inferno; hoc intelligitur per Abrahami verba ad divitem in inferno, 	Inter nos et vos hiatus 
ingens firmatus est, ut qui volunt transcendere hinc ad vos, non possint, neque qui ibi ad nos transire, Luc. xvi 26: </p>
<p>et per haec, 	Dicent montibus et petris, Ruite super nos, et abscondite nos a 
facie sedentis super throno, et ab ira Agni, Apoc. vi 16; Hos. x 8. Quod autem {4} verum attinet, hoc adiri potest a malis, ex causa quia mali pervertunt vera per sinistras interpretationes, et sic 
applicant ad favorem suarum cupiditatum; sed quantum boni in veris adest, tantum non adiri {5}vera possunt. Inde constare potest quam tutelam possunt habere in altera vita qui solum in veris, quae vocantur 
fidei, sunt, et non simul in bono; per bonum {6}intelligitur (x)charitas erga proximum et amor in Dominum, nam omnia bona inde sunt. Ex his nunc {7}patet cur factus fuerit limbus auri circumcirca 
parietes altaris suffitus. @1 i enim$ @2 i cum$ @3 i quia in bono,$ @4 i ad$ @5 verum potest$ @6 significatur$ @7 constare potest$ </p>
