<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9503节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9503.</strong>“要将法版放在柜里”表神性真理，也就是天堂里的主。这从“柜”和“法版”的含义清楚可知：“柜”是指天堂，如前所述；“法版”是指神性真理，因而是指天堂里的主，如下文所述。神性真理之所以是天堂里的主，是因为主是良善本身和真理本身，这二者都是从主发出的，凡从主发出之物就是祂自己。正因如此，主就是天堂；因为从祂发出并被天使接受的神性真理构成天堂。因此，天使接受来自主的神性真理，并因此接受主的方式越完美，他们所拥有的人之形式就越完美。最终他们变得如此完美，以致他们的美丽超出想象；凡看见他们的人，都和我一样会目瞪口呆。因为就其外在形式而言，他们是天上爱和仁的显现，这形式才是真正的人的形式。天使之所以是人的形式，是因为天堂里的神性就是主，那些从主接受良善里面的神性真理之人就是祂的形像。<br />至于“法度”（Testimony，又译为法版、见证等）的含义，在圣言中，“律法”（laws）、“律例”（statutes）、“典章”（judgments）、“训词”（precepts）、“法度”（Testimony）、“话”（words）、“诫命”（commands）、“真理”（truths，经上或译为真实等）、“约”（covenants）是有区别的，这从大量经文可以看出来，尤其诗篇119章，那里提到了所有这些术语，不过“法度”出现在119: 2，14，31，46，59，88，95，111，119，129，138，144，168。在诗篇的别处也有类似区别：<br />耶和华的律法全备，能使灵魂苏醒；耶和华的法度确定，能使简单人有智慧；耶和华的命令正直，能使心欢喜；耶和华的诫命纯洁，能光照眼目。耶和华的典章真实，全然公义。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗19.7.htm">19:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗19.9.htm">9</a>）<br />类似区别还出现在摩西五经（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.45.htm">4:45</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.17.htm">6:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.20.htm">20</a>），耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.23.htm">44:23</a>），以及其它许多经文。由此可见“法度”表示为主作见证的神性真理，因而表示圣言。因为就至高意义而言，圣言唯独论述主，这就是为何内义为主作见证；也就是 说，内义包含关于主，以及源于祂的信之真理和爱之良善的教导。在启示录，经上就在这层意义上也用到“见证”这个词：<br />为神的圣言并为作见证被杀之人。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.9.htm">6:9</a>）<br /><br />他们胜过龙，是因羔羊的血，和他们所见证的话。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.11.htm">12:11</a>）<br />“羔羊的血”是指从主发出的神性真理（<a href="7846.htm">7846</a>，<a href="7877.htm">7877</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>，<a href="9393.htm">9393</a>节），而“所见证的话”是指被人接受的神性真理。启示录12:17；19:10中的“见证”具有同样的含义。<br />从主发出的神性真理被称为“见证”的原因是，它为主作见证，这从主自己在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：<br />从天上来的，是在万有之上。祂将所见所闻的见证出来。那领受祂见证的，就印上印，证明神是真的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.31.htm">3:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.33.htm">33</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />我是为自己作见证，还有差我来的父也是为我作见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.18.htm">8:18</a>）<br /><br />你们查考圣经，给我作见证的就是这些经。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.39.htm">5:39</a>）<br /><br />保惠师，就是真理的圣灵，祂要为我作见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">15:26</a>）<br />从这些经文清楚可知，神性真理被称为“见证”，是因为它为主作见证。这神性真理就是圣言，因为如前所述，就至高意义而言，圣言唯独论述主；因此，圣言就是神性，它的神圣也由此而来。十条诫或十句话，就是从西乃山上所颁布、被刻写在两块石版上并存放在柜子中的律法就是此处那被称为“法版”的。这律法表示整体上的圣言，也就是从主发出的神性真理（参看<a href="9416.htm">9416</a>节）。从主自己对彼拉多所说的话明显可知，神性真理所来自的那一位就是主：<br />彼拉多说，你是王吗？耶稣回答，你说我是王，我为此而生，也为此来到世间，特为给真理作见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.37.htm">18:37</a>）<br />“王”在内义上表示神性真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）；这就是为何主说“我是王，我为此而生，特为给真理作见证”，也就是说，祂自己就是神性真理。由此明显可知柜子中的“法版”表示神性真理，因而表示天堂里的主（<a href="9505.htm">9505</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9503</b></p><p><b>9503.</b>
And thou shalt put into the ark the Testimony. That this signifies the Divine truth which is the Lord in heaven, is evident from the signification of "the ark," as being heaven (of which above); and 
from the signification of "the Testimony," as being the Divine truth, and thus the Lord in heaven (of which in what follows). That Divine truth is the Lord in heaven, is because the Lord is good itself 
and truth itself, both of which proceed from Him, and that which proceeds from Him is Himself. Hence it is that the Lord is heaven; for the Divine truth which is from Him and is received by the angels, 
makes heaven; consequently the more perfectly the angels receive the Divine truth which is from the Lord, thus the more perfectly they receive the Lord, the more perfect human forms they are, and 
finally so perfect that their beauty surpasses belief. He who shall see, as I have, will be amazed; for they are heavenly loves and charities in form, which form is the truly human form. The reason why 
the angels are human forms, is that the Divine in heaven is the Lord, and they who receive from Him the Divine truth in good are images of Him.  [2] As to the signification of "the Testimony," a distinction 
is made in the Word between "laws," "statutes," "judgments," "precepts," "testimonies," "words," "commands," "truths," and "covenants," as can be seen from very many passages; especially in 
David, in Psalm 119, where these are all mentioned, but "testimonies," in verses 2, 14, 31, 46, 59, 88, 95, 111, 119, 129, 138, 144, 168; and likewise in other places in David: </p>
<p>     The law of Jehovah 
is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Jehovah is steadfast, making wise the simple. The commandments of Jehovah are right, making glad the heart; the precept of Jehovah is pure, enlightening 
the eyes. The judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether (Ps. 19:7-9); </p>
<p>and also in Moses (Deut. 4:45; 6:17, 20); and in Jeremiah 44:23; and in many other passages. From all this 
it can be seen that "the Testimony" denotes the Divine truth which testifies concerning the Lord; thus the Word, for in the supreme sense the Word treats of the Lord alone, and consequently in the internal 
sense it testifies concerning Him; that is, it teaches Him and the truths of faith and the goods of love which are from Him. In this sense "testimony" is used also in Revelation: </p>
<p>     Who were 
slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held (Rev. 6:9).      They overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony (Rev. 12:11). "The blood of 
the Lamb" denotes the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord (n. 7846, 7877, 9127, 9393), and "the word of the testimony" denotes the Divine truth received by man; in like manner in Rev. 12:17; 19:10. [3] 
That the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord is called "the testimony," is because it testifies concerning the Lord, as is evident from the words of the Lord Himself in John: </p>
<p>     He that 
cometh from heaven is above all. What He hath seen and heard, that He testifieth. He that receiveth His testimony hath set his seal to this, that God is true (John 3:31-33).      I am He that testifieth 
of Myself, and the Father that sent Me testifieth of Me (John 8:18).      Search the Scriptures, and these are they which testify of Me (John 5:39).       The Paraclete, the Spirit of truth, 
He shall testify of Me (John 15:26). From these passages it is evident that the Divine truth is called "the testimony" for the reason that it testifies concerning the Lord. This Divine truth is the Word, 
for as before said, in the supreme sense the Word treats of the Lord alone; consequently the Word is Divine, and from this comes its holiness. The Ten Words also, that is, the Law promulgated from 
Mount Sinai, and inscribed on the two tables, and stored up in the ark, is what is here called "the Testimony" (that this Law signifies the Word, that is, the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, 
in its whole complex, see n. 9416). That it is the Lord from whom comes the Divine truth, is plain from His words to Pilate: </p>
<p>     Pilate saith, Art thou a King? Jesus answered, Thou sayest I am a King. 
To this was I born, and for this am I come into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth (John 18:37); </p>
<p>by "a king" in the internal sense is signified the Divine truth (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 
3009, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148); and therefore He said "I am a king, and to this was I born, that I should give testimony to the truth," that is, that He is the Divine truth. From all this 
it is now plain that by "the Testimony" in the ark is signified the Divine truth, thus the Lord in heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9503</b></p><p><b>9503.</b>
'And you shall put into the ark the Testimony' means Divine Truth, which is the Lord in heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'the ark' as heaven, dealt with above; and from the meaning of 'the Testimony' 
as Divine Truth, thus the Lord in heaven, dealt with below. The reason why Divine Truth is the Lord in heaven is that the Lord is Goodness itself and Truth itself, for both emanate from Him 
and He Himself composes what emanates from Him. So it is that the Lord is heaven, for Divine Truth which emanates from Him and is received by the angels makes heaven. Consequently the more perfect the 
manner in which angels receive Divine Truth that comes from the Lord and accordingly receive the Lord, the more perfect the human forms they possess. Eventually they become so perfect that their beauty 
surpasses belief; anyone who sees them, as I have done, will be dumbfounded. For in their outward form angels are manifestations of heavenly love and charity, and that is the truly human form. The 
reason why angels possess human forms is that the Divine in heaven is the Lord, and those who receive Divine Truth within good from Him are images of Him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the meaning of 'the Testimony', 
a distinction is drawn in the Word between laws, statutes, judgements, commandments, testimonies, words, commands, truths, and covenants, as may be recognized from a number of places, especially 
in David's Psalm <a href="119.htm">119</a>, where all these terms occur, testimonies doing so in verses 2, 14, 31, 46, 59, 88, 99, 111, 119, 125, 138, 144, 168. A like distinction occurs elsewhere in the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
The 
law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple; the commands of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Jehovah is pure, 
enlightening the eyes; the judgements of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2019:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 19:7-9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The like occurs in Moses, at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:45;%206:17,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:45; 6:17, 20</a>; also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%2044:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 44:23</a>; and many times elsewhere. 
From all this it may be recognized that 'the Testimony' means Divine Truth, which testifies of the Lord, and so means the Word. For in the highest sense of the Word the only subject is the Lord, 
and this is why the internal sense testifies of Him, that is, contains teachings about Him and about the truths of faith and forms of the good of love which He is the source of. 'Testimony' is again 
used with this meaning in the Book of Revelation,  </p>
<p>... those who had been killed on account of the Word of God and on account of the testimony which they had. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere,  </p>
<blockquote>
They 
conquered the dragon by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The blood of the Lamb' is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, <a href="7846.htm">7846</a>, <a href="7877.htm">7877</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>, <a href="9393.htm">9393</a>, while 'the 
word of their testimony' is Divine Truth received by man. 'Testimony' is used with the same meaning at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:17;%2019:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:17; 19:10</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is called 'the Testimony' 
because it testifies of the Lord is clear from the Lord's own words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who comes from heaven is above all. What He has seen and heard, that He testifies. He who receives His testimony 
has set his seal [to this], that God is truthful. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:31-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:31-33</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I am One who testifies of Myself; and He, the Father, who sent Me testifies of Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the 
same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Search the Scriptures; and it is they that testify of Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:39</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Paraclete, the Spirit of truth, He will testify of Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:26, 27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From 
all this it is clear that Divine Truth is called the Testimony because it testifies of the Lord. This Divine Truth is the Word, for as stated above, the only subject in the highest sense of the Word 
is the Lord; this is what makes the Word Divine and therefore what makes it holy. Furthermore the Ten Words or the Law which were declared from Mount Sinai, inscribed on two tablets [of stone], and 
stored in the ark, is what is here called the Testimony. For that Law means the Word or Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, in its entirety, see <a href="9416.htm">9416</a>. It is evident from the Lord's own words to Pilate 
that He is the One from whom Divine Truth comes,  </p>
<blockquote>
Pilate said, Are you a king? Jesus answered, You say [it, because] I am a King. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, 
that I may bear testimony to the truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2018:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 18:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'A king' in the internal sense means Divine Truth, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>, <a href="5068.htm">5068</a>, <a href="6148.htm">6148</a>. This was why the Lord said, 'I 
am a King' and, 'For this I was born, that I may bear testimony to the truth', that is, that He Himself is Divine Truth. From all this it is now evident that 'the Testimony' in the ark means Divine 
Truth and so the Lord in heaven.  </p>

`Et dabis ad arcam testimonium': quod significet Divinum Verum, quod est Dominus in caelo, constat ex significatione `arcae' quod sit caelum, de qua supra, et ex significatione `testimonii' quod sit 
Divinum Verum, ita Dominus in caelo, de qua sequitur; quod Divinum Verum sit Dominus in caelo, est quia Dominus est ipsum Bonum et ipsum Verum, {1}utrumque enim procedit ab Ipso, et quod ab Ipso procedit 
est Ipse; inde est quod Dominus sit caelum; Divinum enim Verum quod ab Ipso, et recipitur ab angelis, facit caelum {2};inde {3} est quod angeli quo perfectius recipiunt Divinum Verum quod a Domino, 
ita Dominum, eo perfectiones formae humanae sint, et tandem ita perfectae ut pulchritudo excedat fidem; {4}qui visurus, sicut ego, obstupescet; sunt enim {5} amores caelestes et charitates in forma, 
quae (t)est forma vere humana; causa quod angeli formae humanae sint, est quia Divinum in caelo est Dominus, et qui recipiunt Divinum Verum in bono ab Ipso sunt ejus imagines. 	Quod significationem 
testimonii attinet, distinguitur in Verbo 2 inter leges, statuta, judicia, praecepta, testimonia, verba, mandata, veritates, {6}(x)foedera, ut constare potest ex plurimis locis {7}; imprimis apud Davidem 
in Ps. cxix, ubi omnia illa nominantur, ac testimonia vers. 2, 14, 31, 46, 59, 88, (x)99, 111, (x)119, 125, 138, 144, 168, pariter alibi apud eundem, 	Lex Jehovae perfecta recreans animam, testimonium 
Jehovae firmum, sapientem reddens simplicem; mandata Jehovae recta laetificantia cor; praeceptum Jehovae purum illuminans oculos; judicia Jehovae veritas, justa sunt simul, Ps. xix 8-10 [A.V. 7-9]; </p>
<p>et 
quoque apud Moschen, Deut. iv 45, vi 17, 20; {8}tum apud Jeremiam xliv 23; et alibi pluries; ex illis constare potest quod `testimonium' sit Divinum Verum, quod testatur de Domino, ita Verbum; 
nam id in sensu supremo agit de solo Domino, et inde in sensu interno {9} testatur de Ipso, hoc est, docet Ipsum, ac vera quae fidei (c)et bona quae amoris, quae ab Ipso; in hoc sensu dicitur etiam 
`testimonium' in Apocalypsi, 	Qui occisi propter Verbum Dei, et propter testimonium, quod habebant, vi 9: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Vicerunt draconem per sanguinem Agni, et per verbum testimonii sui, xii (x)11; </p>
<p>`sanguis 
Agni' est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, n. 7846, 7877, 9127, 9393, et `verbum testimonii' est Divinum Verum receptum ab homine; similiter ibi xii 17, xix 10. 	3 Quod {10} Divinum Verum procedens 
a Domino {11}testimonium dicatur, ex eo quod testetur de Domino, constat ab Ipsius Domini verbis apud Johannem, 	Qui e caelo venit, supra omnes est; quod vidit et audivit, hoc testatur; quisquis 
accipit Ipsius testimonium, obsignavit (x)quod Deus verax sit, iii 31-33: </p>
<p>{12}apud eundem, 	Ego sum Qui testor de Me Ipso, et testatur de Me Qui misit Me, Pater, viii 18: </p>
<p>apud eandem, 	Scrutamini 
Scripturas, atqui illae sunt quae testantur de Me, v 39: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Paracletus Spiritus veritatis, ille testabitur de Me, xv 26, 27; ex his constat quod Divinum Verum dicatur testimonium, 
ex eo quod testetur de Domino; {13}id Verum est Verbum, nam Verbum in supremo sensu, ut supra dictum est, agit de solo Domino; inde Verbum est Divinum, et inde ejus sanctum. Etiam decem Verba seu Lex 
quae promulgata e monte Sinai, et inscripta binis tabulis, et reposita in arca, est quae hic vocatur testimonium; quod illa Lex significet Verbum seu Divinum Verum procedens a Domino in omni complexu, 
videatur n. 9416. 4 Quod Dominus sit a Quo Divinum Verum, patet ab Ipsius verbis ad Pilatum, 	Dixit Pilatus, An rex tu es? respondit Jesus, Tu dicis, Rex sum Ego; Ego in hoc natus sum, et in hoc veni 
in mundum, ut testimonium dem veritati, Joh. xviii 37; </p>
<p>per `regem' in sensu interno significatur Divinum Verum, {14} videatur n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4581, (x)4966, 5044, 5068, 6148; quapropter 
{15}dixit, Rex sum Ego, et in hoc natus sum, ut testimonium dem veritati, {16}hoc est, quod Ipse sit Divinum Verum. Ex his nunc patet quod per `testimonium' in arca significetur Divinum Verum,
