<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2132节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2132.</strong>至于在圣言中，经上说，有人没穿婚宴的礼服就进来了（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.11.htm">22:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.13.htm">13</a>），然后被丢了出去，这句经文也向我显明。有些人活在肉身时获得伪装光明天使的能力；在世时，当处于这种虚伪状态时，他们也能混入附近的天堂社群。不过，他们无法长时间地待在那里，因为他们一觉察到那里相爱的气场，就会充满惊惧和恐怖，并将自己扔了下去（然而在灵人界，他们看似被丢了下去），有的朝死水塘，有的朝欣嫩子谷（Gehenna），有的朝向某个其它地狱坠去。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2132</b></p><p><b>2132.</b>
As to its being said in the Word that there entered also one who was not clothed in a wedding garment (Matt. 22:11-13), and that he was cast out, it was shown how the case is with this also. There are 
some persons who during their bodily life have been imbued with the deceit of being able to feign themselves angels of light; and in the other life, when in this hypocritical state, they are also able 
to insinuate themselves into the nearest heavenly societies. But they do not remain there long, for the moment they perceive the sphere of mutual love there, they are seized with fear and horror, and 
cast themselves down (and it then appears in the world of spirits as if they had been cast down), some toward the lake, some toward Gehenna, and some into some other hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2132</b></p><p><b>2132.</b>
The implications of the description in the Word of someone entering who was not wearing a wedding garment, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:11-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:11-13</a>, and of his being cast out, have also been shown to me. There are people who 
during their lifetime have acquired the ability to impersonate angels of light, and when they resume that hypocritical condition in the next life they are also able to worm their way into neighbouring 
heavenly communities. But they do not remain in them for long, for the instant they perceive the sphere of mutual love there they are seized with fear and terror and cast themselves out headlong - though 
in the world of spirits at the time it seems as though they have been cast down - some towards the stagnant pond, some towards Gehenna, and some into some other hell. </p>

(s)  Quod in Verbo dicatur quod `intraverit etiam unus qui non indutus veste nuptiali,' Matth. xxii 11-13, et quod is ejectus sit, quomodo hoc se habet, etiam ostensum: sunt qui {1} illo dolo in vita 
eorum corporis imbuti ut simulare possint lucis angelos, et tunc cum in illo statu hypocritico in altera vita sunt, etiam se insinuare possunt in societates proximas caelestes; at non diu ibi persistunt, 
ilico enim dum percipiunt amoris mutui sphaeram ibi, timore et horrore corripiuntur et se inde praecipitant, ac tunc in mundo spirituum apparet sicut quod dejecti sint, quidam versus stagnum, quidam 
versus gehennam, quidam in aliud quoddam infernum.(s) 	@1 quidam$ </p>
