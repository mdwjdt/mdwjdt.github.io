<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10744节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10744</strong>.他们因从天上得不到任何东西，故在心里拒绝接受神和死后的生命，也因此藐视教会的一切。即便他们善待自己的同胞、社区、国家或教会，说它们的好话，也无济于事，因为他们做这一切是为了自己和世界，目的是叫别人看见，获得名声、地位和利益。对他们来说，这些目的是外在的约束，促使他们做好事，阻止他们做坏事。至于内在的约束，即良心的约束，也就是促使他们不做任何恶事，因为它是罪，违背神之律法的那种约束，他们是没有的。</p>

As these persons receive nothing from heaven, in their hearts they deny God and the life after death, and consequently hold in contempt all things of the church. It avails not that they do good to their 
fellow-citizen, to society, to their country, and to the church; or that they speak well about these; because they do all this for the sake of themselves and the world, in order to save appearances, 
and to secure reputation, honors, and gains. These are the external bonds by which such persons are brought to do what is good, and are withheld from doing what is evil. As for internal bonds, which 
are those of conscience, and which dictate that what is evil must not be done because it is sin, and is contrary to the Divine laws, they have none. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10744</b></p><p><b>10744.</b>
Because they receive nothing from heaven, in their heart they reject God and the life after death, and as a consequence also belittle everything of the Church. It makes no difference if they do good 
to their fellow citizen, community, country, or Church, and speak well of them, for they speak and act in that way for selfish and worldly reasons, to the end that they may be seen by others and acquire 
reputation, position, and gain. For them these aims serve as outward controls by which they are led to do what is good and are held back from doing what is bad. But they lack any inner controls of 
conscience that urge them not to do anything evil because it is a sin and contrary to God's laws.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10744</b>
</p><b>10744.</b>
Illi quia nihil a caelo recipiunt, corde suo negant Deum ac vitam post mortem, et inde quoque vilipendunt omnia Ecclesiae; nihil facit si illi bonum faciant concivi, societati, patriae, et Ecclesiae, 
ac si bene de illis loquantur, haec enim faciunt propter se et propter mundum, ut appareant et aucupentur famam, honores, et lucra.  Haec illis sunt vincula externa per quae feruntur ad faciendum bonum, 
ac detinentur a faciendo malum; at illis vincula interna nulla sunt, quae sunt conscientiae, quod non faciendum sit malum quia peccatum et contra leges Divinas. </p>
