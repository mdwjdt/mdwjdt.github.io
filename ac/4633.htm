<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4633节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4633.</strong>从前面关于觉知和气味这个问题的阐述明显可知，在来世，每个人的生命，因而每个人的情感都一目了然；因此，人若以为他以前的秉性和由此而来的生活品质在那里不为人知，或以为他在那里能如在世上那样隐藏他的意图，就大错特错了。此外，在来世，不仅人在自己身上所知道的事，而且连那些他所不知道的事，就是诸如因反复实践而最终沉浸于其生命快乐中的事也一目了然；因为在这种情况下，它们会从他的视线和对他自身的反思中消失。由于同样的原因而向他隐藏起来的其思维、言语和行为的实际目的在天堂会被充分觉察出来；因为天堂处在目的的气场和觉知中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4633</b></p><p><b>4633.</b>
From what has now been said on the subject of perceptions and odors, it is manifest that in the other life everyone's life, and consequently everyone's affection, is in plain view; and  therefore anyone 
who believes that his previous character, and the consequent quality of his life, is unknown there, or that he can there hide his disposition as in this world, is much mistaken. Moreover, not only 
are those things seen there which a man has known about himself, but also those which he has not known, namely, such things as by frequent practice he has at last immersed in the delights of life, so 
as to cause them to disappear from his sight and reflection. The very ends of his thought, of his speech, and of his actions, which from a like cause have become hidden from him, are most plainly perceived 
in heaven, for heaven is in the sphere and perception of ends. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4633</b></p><p><b>4633.</b>
From all that has been stated about perceptions and also odours it is evident that in the next life everyone's life, and consequently everyone's affection, are in full view. Anyone therefore who thinks 
that his previous character and consequently his present life are not known there, or that he is able to conceal his intentions as he could in the world, is much mistaken. In that life also not only 
the things that a person recognizes in himself are in full view but also those he does not recognize, namely those which through his repeated use of them come at length to be immersed among the delights 
of his life; for in that case they fade from his view and reflection about himself. The actual ends in view contained in his thought, speech, and actions, which for a similar reason have become hidden 
from him, are fully perceived in heaven; for the sphere and perception of ends obtain in heaven. </p>

</p><b>4633.</b>
Ex his quae de perceptionibus et quoque de odoribus dicta sunt, patet quod cujusvis vita, proinde cujusvis affectio manifeste pateat in altera vita; qui itaque credit quod non sciatur ibi qualis 
fuerat et qualis inde vita ei sit, et quod ibi occultare possit suum animum sicut in mundo, multum fallitur: ibi etiam patent non modo quae homo de se novit, sed etiam quae de se non novit, nempe illa 
quae is per frequentem usum tandem immersit jucundis vitae, nam {1}tunc disparantur a visu et reflexione ejus: </p>
<p>ipsi fines cogitationis ejus, et {2}loquelae ejus et actionum ejus, qui ex simili 
causa ei occulti facti {3}sunt, in caelo manifestissime percipiuntur; caelum enim in sphaera et perceptione finium est.      @1 d tunc, i haec$      @2 loquutionis$      @3 fuerunt$ </p>
