<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>637.</strong>“我要把他们和这地一并毁灭”表示人类和教会将一同灭亡，这是鉴于以下原因：如果主的教会完全从地上灭绝，人类决不可能存在，所有人无一例外会灭亡。如前所述，教会如同心脏：只要心脏还活着，周围的器官和肢体也会存活；但心脏一死，其它一切都会死。主在地上的教会就如同心脏，人类由此而来，甚至其部位，也就是教会之外的事物也会有生命。谁也不知道这个原因，但为了让人们对此有所了解，我来说一说，地上的整个人类如同一具躯体及其各个部位，其中的教会类似心脏；若没有教会，使得主可以藉着天堂和精灵界与之结合，如同与一个心脏结合，就会有一个切断。人类若与主切断联系，必立时灭亡。这就是为何自创造人类以来一直有某个教会存在的原因，每当教会开始灭亡时，它仍存留在某些人身上。<br />②这也是主降世的原因。若非祂因着慈悲降世，这个星球上的整个人类必要灭亡，因为此时教会即将走到尽头，几乎没有任何良善或真理存活下来。若非主藉着天堂和精灵界与人类结合，人类决不能存活。原因在于，就本身而言，人甚至比动物还低级。若由着他自己，他会匆忙毁灭自己和其他人。因为他只有摧毁自己和其他人的欲望。他的秩序（order）理应是爱人如己，但现在人人都是爱自己胜过别人，进而憎恨其他所有人。然而，不会说话的动物却迥然不同，它们的秩序符合其生活的秩序。因此，它们完全照着它们所在的秩序生活，而人则完全违背其秩序。所以，若非主怜悯人，并藉着天使与其结合，他决不能存活片刻，而人并不知道这一点。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]637.</strong> To expand on the symbolism of the words I will destroy them together with the earth as the fact that the human race would meet its end along with the church: If the Lord's church were completely obliterated from the planet, the human race could never survive. Every last person would die.<br />The church resembles the heart, as noted earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_637/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468#subsection-2-2" target=_top>468:2</a>]. As long as the heart thrives, so can the surrounding organs and limbs. But as soon as the heart dies, everything else dies too. The Lord's church on earth is like the heart; from it the human race — including people outside the church — receives life. Since no one has the faintest idea why this is so, I wish to explain.<br />The situation of the earth's entire population resembles that of the human body with all its parts.{*1} In this body, the church plays the role of the heart. If there were no church supplying the heart's place — a church with which the Lord could be united by means of heaven and the world of spirits — a break would occur. And if there were a break between the human race and the Lord, we would be annihilated immediately.<br />For this reason, a church has always existed, ever since the first moment of humanity's creation. Even when the church has begun to die out, it has always remained alive in a few people.<br />[2] The Lord came into the world for the same reason. Had divine mercy not prompted him to come, the whole human race on this planet would have been destroyed, because at that time the church had reached its last stages and hardly any goodness or truth was left.<br />Because we humans, regarded in ourselves, are much lower than animals, we have no chance at survival unless we are intimately connected with the Lord through heaven and the world of spirits. Left on our own we would plunge headlong into destroying ourselves and everyone else, because the ruination of ourselves and everyone else is all we long for.<br />Our proper code of life is to love one another as we love ourselves, but what we actually do these days is to love ourselves more than others and thus hate everyone else. Now, with unreasoning animals the case is totally different. Their proper code is the one they live by, and so they live in thorough harmony with their destiny. We humans, though, live exactly opposite to the pattern ordained for us, so if the Lord did not take pity on us, if he did not bind us to him through angels, we could not possibly survive a single moment.<br />Of this fact humanity is unaware.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In Swedenborg's system, the human figure has correspondences at many levels. Here he indicates that humanity on earth resembles a single individual. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_637/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_59" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 59-77</a>, he says that all of heaven has this form (see note 5 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_637/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_0" target=_top>0</a> above), as well as each community in heaven (compare note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_637/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_318" target=_top>318</a> above). Moreover, each community in heaven has its place in this body (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_637/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_65" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 65</a>). Similarly, here on earth the church constitutes the heart of humanity, as this passage indicates. [RS] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 637</b></p><p><b>637.</b>
That "I will destroy them with the earth" signified that together with the church the human race would perish, is on this account: If the Lord's church should be entirely extinguished on the earth, the 
human race could by no means exist, but one and all would perish. The church, as before said, is as the heart: so long as the heart lives, the neighboring viscera and members can live; but as soon 
as the heart dies, they one and all die also. The Lord's church on earth is as the heart, whence the human race, even that part of it which is outside the church, has life. The reason is quite unknown 
to anyone, but in order that something of it may be known, it may be stated that the whole human race on earth is as a body with its parts, wherein the church is as the heart; and that unless there were 
a church with which as with a heart the Lord might be united through heaven and the world of spirits, there would be disjunction; and if there were disjunction of the human race from the Lord, it 
would instantly perish. This is the reason why from the first creation of man there has always been some church, and whenever the church has begun to perish it has yet remained with some. [2] This was 
also the reason of the Lord's coming into the world. If in His Divine mercy He had not come, the whole human race on this earth would have perished, for the church was then at its last extremity, and 
there was scarcely any good and truth surviving. The reason why the human race cannot live unless it is conjoined with the Lord through heaven and the world of spirits, is that in himself regarded man 
is much viler than the brutes. If left to himself he would rush into the ruin of himself and of all things; for he desires nothing else than what would be for the destruction of himself and of all. 
His order should be that one should love another as himself; but now everyone loves himself more than others, and thus hates all others. But with brute animals the case is quite different: their order 
is that according to which they live. Thus they live quite according to the order in which they are, and man entirely contrary to his order. Therefore unless the Lord should have compassion on him, and 
conjoin him with Himself through angels, he could not live a single moment; but this he does not know. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 637</b></p><p><b>637.</b>
The implications of 'I will destroy them together with the earth' meaning that the human race would perish together with the Church are as follows: If the Lord's Church had been completely wiped out 
on earth, the human race could not have remained in being at all, for all without exception would have perished. As previously stated, the Church is as the heart. As long as the heart is alive, surrounding 
organs and limbs are able to live as well. But the moment the heart dies, everything else dies as well. The Lord's Church on earth is as the heart, and from it the human race, even that part of 
it lying outside of the Church, has life. The reason why is totally unknown to anybody. But so that something of this may be known, let it be said that the whole human race on earth is like the body and 
all its parts, with the Church resembling the heart. And if there were no Church, with which as a kind of heart the Lord might unite Himself by way of heaven and the world of spirits, there would be 
a severance; and once the human race was severed from the Lord it would perish instantly. This is the reason why since man was first created there has always been some Church in existence; and as often 
as the Church has begun to perish it has nevertheless remained with certain people. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This was also the reason why the Lord came into the world. Unless, in His Divine mercy, He had come, the 
whole human race on this planet would have perished, for at that time the Church was nearing its end, and scarcely any good or truth was surviving. The reason the human race cannot possibly live unless 
it is joined to the Lord by way of heaven and the world of spirits is that regarded in himself man is even lower than animals. Left to himself he would rush to ruin himself and everybody else, for he 
has no other desire than to destroy himself and everybody else. His order ought to be as one person loving another as he does himself, but at present everyone loves himself more than others and so hates 
everybody else. Dumb animals are quite different however, for theirs is an order which they do live according to; and so they live wholly according to the order that is theirs, whereas man lives 
altogether contrary to order. Consequently unless the Lord had taken pity on man and by means of angels joined him to Himself he could not possibly live for a single moment. Of this man has no knowledge. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 637</b>
</p><b>637.</b>
Quod 'perdam eos cum terra' significet quod genus humanum periret cum Ecclesia, res se ita habet: si Ecclesia Domini prorsus exstingueretur in tellure, genus humanum nequaquam potuisset esse, sed omnes 
cum singulis perirent; se habet Ecclesia sicut cor, ut prius dictum; quamdiu cor vivit, circumjacentia viscera et membra possunt vivere; at ut primum cor moritur, omnia et singula quoque moriuntur: 
Ecclesia Domini in tellure est sicut cor, inde genus humanum, etiam illud quod extra Ecclesiam est, vitam habent; causa ignotissima unicuivis est; sed ut aliquid sciatur, se habet universum genus humanum 
in tellure, sicut corpus cum ejus partibus, in quo Ecclesia est instar cordis; et nisi Ecclesia foret, cum qua, sicut cum quodam corde, uniretur Dominus per caelum et mundum spirituum, foret disjunctio; 
et cum disjunctio humani generis a Domino, ilico periret: quae causa est quod a prima creatione hominis semper aliqua Ecclesia fuerit; et, quoties Ecclesia perire incepit, quod usque remanserit 
apud quosdam. [2] Haec quoque causa fuit Adventus Domini in mundum; nisi ex Divina Ipsius Misericordia venisset, universum genus humanum in hac tellure periisset; nam tunc Ecclesia in extremis fuit 
et vix aliquid bonum et verum superstes.  Quod genus humanum nusquam vivere possit nisi conjunctum sit cum Domino per caelum et mundum spirituum, causa est quia homo in se spectatus multo vilius est 
brutis; si relinqueretur sibi, rueret in sui et omnium perniciem, nam nihil aliud quam sui et omnium destructionem cupit, ordo ejus foret ut unus alterum amaret sicut semet, sed nunc unusquisque semet 
amat prae aliis, ita omnes alios odit; at bruta animalia prorsus aliter; eorum ordo est, secundum quem vivunt; ita vivunt prorsus secundum ordinem in quo sunt, homo autem prorsus contra ordinem; quare 
nisi Dominus ejus misereretur et conjungeret eum Sibi per angelos, nusquam potuisset unum minutum vivere: hoc homo ignorat. </p>
