THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-10. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon 
the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments, and caused 
frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah, that He remove the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, 
that they may sacrifice to Jehovah. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou honor over me, till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee, 
and from thy houses? Only in the river shall they be left. And he said, Unto the morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God. And 
the frogs shall be removed from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; only in the river shall they be left. And Moses and Aaron went out from before Pharaoh and Moses 
cried unto Jehovah upon the word of the frogs which He had laid on Pharaoh. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. 
And they gathered them together in heaps and heaps; and the land stank. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Say unto Aaron," signifies the influx of the internal law into the 
external law; "Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod," signifies the power of internal truth through external truth; "over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools," signifies against falsities; 
"and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt," signifies reasonings from mere falsities; "and Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt," signifies the effect of the power of internal 
truth through external truth against falsities; "and the frogs came up," signifies reasonings from mere falsities; "and covered the land of Egypt," signifies that the natural mind was made such; "and 
the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments," signifies the abuse of Divine order, whence there was the like in the outward form; "and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt," signifies 
in respect to reasonings from the natural mind; "and Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron," signifies the presence of the law Divine; "and said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah," signifies humiliation from 
weariness; "that He remove the frogs from me, and from my people," signifies that they should not be driven to reasoning from mere falsities; "and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice 
to Jehovah," signifies that they would then leave those who were of the spiritual church so that they may worship their God; "and Moses said unto Pharaoh," signifies the answer; "Have thou honor upon 
me," signifies that the law Divine ought to be trusted; "till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people," signifies intercession for those who are in falsities and infest; 
"to cut off the frogs from thee, and from thy houses," signifies that the reasonings may cease; "only in the river shall they be left," signifies that they should remain with falsities where these 
are; "and he said, Unto the morrow," signifies forever; "and he said, Be it according to thy word," signifies confirmation thence; "that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God," signifies 
that there is one God, and none besides Him; "and the frogs shall be removed from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people," signifies that they should not be driven 
to reason from mere falsities; "only in the river shall they be left," signifies that they should remain with falsities where these are; "and Moses and Aaron went out from before Pharaoh," signifies 
separation from those who had reasoned from mere falsities; "and Moses cried unto Jehovah upon the word of the frogs which He had laid on Pharaoh," signifies intercession; "and Jehovah did according 
to the word of Moses," signifies that it was so done according to the word of the Lord; "and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields," signifies that reasonings from 
mere falsities ceased with them everywhere in the natural; "and they gathered them together in heaps and heaps," signifies that these reasoning falsities were arranged in bundles in the natural; "and 
the land stank," signifies what was foul and loathsome therefrom. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-10 And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to rise up onto the 
land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs rose up and covered the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their enchantments, and they 
caused frogs to rise up onto the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Plead with Jehovah to remove the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will send the people away to sacrifice 
to Jehovah. And Moses said to Pharaoh, Have honour over me. Till when shall I plead for you, and for your servants, and for your people, so as the frogs will be eliminated from you, and from your 
houses, and survive only in the river? And he said, Until tomorrow. And he said, Let it be according to your word, so that you may know that there is none like Jehovah our God. And the frogs will be 
removed from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people, and survive only in the river. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried out to Jehovah about<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
the frogs which He had brought on Pharaoh. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields. And they gathered them into 
heaps [upon] heaps; and the land stank.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instruction. 'Say to Aaron' means an influx of inward law into outward law. 'Stretch out your hand with your rod' means 
the power of inward truth directed through outward truth. 'Over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools' means against falsities. 'And cause frogs to rise up onto the land of Egypt' means reasonings 
arising from utter falsities. 'And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt' means the effect of the power of inward truth directed through outward truth against falsities. 'And 
frogs rose up' means reasonings arising from utter falsities. 'And covered the land of Egypt' means that the natural mind became such. 'And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their enchantments' 
means a misuse of Divine order, whereby something that to outward appearances looks the same is produced. 'And they caused frogs to rise up onto the land of Egypt' means in the form of reasonings springing 
from the natural mind. 'And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron' means the presence of the law of God. 'And said, Plead with Jehovah' means self-abasement resulting from weariness. 'To remove the frogs 
from me, and from my people' means in order that they might not be compelled to use reasonings arising from utter falsities. 'And I will send the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah' means that they 
would then leave those who belonged to the spiritual Church, so that they could worship their God. 'And Moses said to Pharaoh' means the reply. 'Have honour over me' means that the law of God was to 
be trusted. 'Till when shall I plead for you, and for your servants, and for your people' means intercession made for those steeped in falsities who engage in molestation. 'So as the frogs will be eliminated 
from you, and from your houses' means in order that the reasonings may come to an end. 'Survive only in the river?' means that they are destined to remain with falsities, in the place where 
these reside. 'And he said, Until tomorrow' means for evermore. 'And he said, Let it be according to your word' means an ensuing endorsement. 'So that you may know that there is none like Jehovah our 
God' means that there is one God and none besides Him. 'And the frogs will be removed from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people' means that they would not be compelled 
to use reasonings arising from utter falsities. 'Survive only in the river' means that they were to remain with falsities, in the place where these reside. 'And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh' 
means a separation from those who used reasonings arising from utter falsities. 'And Moses cried out to Jehovah about the frogs which He had brought on Pharaoh' means intercession. 'And Jehovah did 
according to the word of Moses' means that it was so done according to the Lord's word. 'And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields' means that with those people 
reasonings arising from utter falsities, wherever they were present in the natural, came to an end. 'And they gathered them into heaps [upon] heaps' means that those false reasonings were arranged 
into bundles in the natural. 'And the land stank' means what was as a result foul and repulsive.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers.  1-10.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Dic ad Aharonem, Extende manum tuam baculo tuo, super flumina, super fluvios, et super stagna, et fac ascendere ranas super terram Aegypti. 
 Et extendit Aharon manum suam super aquas Aegypti, et ascendit rana, et obtexit terram Aegypti.  Et fecerunt ita magi Aegypti incantationibus suis, et ascendere fecerunt ranas super terram Aegypti. 
 Et vocavit Pharao Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit, Supplicate ad Jehovam, et removeat ranas a me, et a populo meo, et dimittam populum, et sacrificent Jehovae.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Pharaonem, Honorem 
habe super me, quousque supplicabo tibi, et servis tuis, et populo tuo, ad exscindendum ranas a te, et a domibus tuis; tantum in fluvio supererunt.  Et dixit, Ad crastinum; et dixit, Secundum verbum 
tuum, propterea ut scias quod nullus sicut Jehovah Deus noster.  Et removebuntur ranae a te, et a domibus tuis, et a servis tuis, et a populo tuo; tantum in fluvio supererunt.  Et exivit Moscheh et Aharon 
a cum Pharaone, et clamavit Moscheh ad Jehovam super verbo ranarum quas imposuit Pharaoni.  Et fecit Jehovah secundum verbum Moschis; et mortuae sunt ranae e domibus, ex atriis, et ex agris.  Et 
congregaverunt illos acervis acervis; et putuit terra.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem: `Dic ad Aharonem' significat influxum legis internae in legem externam: `Extende manum

ex meris falsis: `et obtexit terram Aegypti' significat mentem naturalem, quod talis facta: `et fecerunt ita magi Aegypti incantationibus suis' significat abusum ordinis Divini, unde simile in

dixit, Supplicate ad Jehovam' significat ex taedio humiliationem: `et removeat ranas a me, et a populo meo' significat ut non adigerentur ad ratiocinandum ex meris falsis: `et dimittam populum, et sacrificent 
Jehovae' significat quod relinquerent tunc illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali ut colant Deum suum: `et dixit Moscheh ad Pharaonem' significat responsum {1}: `Honorem habe super me' significat 
quod fidendum legi Divinae: `quousque supplicabo tibi, et servis tuis, et populo tuo' significat intercessionem pro illis qui in falsis et infestant: `ad exscindendum ranas a te, et a domibus tuis' significat 
ut cessent ratiocinationes: `tantum in fluvio supererunt significat quod remansurae cum falsis ubi illa: `et dixit, Ad crastinum' significat in perpetuum: `et dixit, Secundum verbum tuum' significat 
confirmationem inde: `ut scias quod nullus sicut Jehovah Deus noster' significat quod unus Deus et non praeter Ipsum: `et removebuntur ranae a te, et a domibus tuis, et a servis tuis, et a populo 
tuo' significat quod non adigerentur ratiocinari ex meris falsis: `tantum in fluvio supererunt' significat quod remanerent cum falsis ubi illa: `et exivit Moscheh et Aharon a cum Pharaone' significat 
separationem ab illis qui ex meris falsis ratiocinati sunt: `et clamavit Moscheh ad Jehovam super verbo ranarum quas imposuit Pharaoni' significat intercessionem: `et fecit Jehovah secundum verbum 
Moschis' significat quod ita factum secundum verbum Domini: `et mortuae sunt ranae e domibus, ex atriis, et ex agris' significat quod apud illos cessarent ratiocinationes ex meris falsis ubique in naturali: 
`et congregaverunt illos acervis acervis' significat quod falsa illa ratiocinantia fasciculatim in naturali disponerentur:  et putuit terra' significat taetrum inde et aversatile. 	@1 i cum increpatione
