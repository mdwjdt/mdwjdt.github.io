<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4912节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4912.</strong>“说，她比我更有义”表外在与内在的结合不存在，只有内在与外在的结合存在。这从前面关于犹太民族中间并在这个民族里面的教会的阐述（<a href="4899.htm">4899</a>节）清楚可知，即：教会存在于这个民族中间，也就是说，内在与外在结合；但教会并不存在于这个民族里面，也就是说，外在并未与内在结合。因为若教会存在于一个民族里面，一种相互关系必须存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4912</b></p><p><b>4912.</b>
And said, She is more just than I. That this signifies that there was no conjunction of the external with the internal, but only of the internal with the external, is evident from what was said above 
(n. 4899) about the church with the Jewish nation, and in them, namely, that there was a church with that people, that is, the internal was conjoined with the external; but that there was no church in 
them, that is, the external was not conjoined with the internal; for that the church may be in a nation there must be reciprocity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4912</b></p><p><b>4912.</b>
'And said, She is more righteous than I am' means that no joining of what was external to what was internal existed, only what was internal to what was external. This is clear from what has been stated 
above regarding the Church among the Jewish nation and within that nation, in <a href="4899.htm">4899</a>, namely that the Church existed among that nation, that is, what was internal was joined to what was external, but 
that no Church existed within that nation, that is, what was external was not joined to what was internal. For if a Church is to exist within a nation, a reciprocal relationship must exist. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4912</b>
</p><b>4912.</b>
`Et dixit, Justa prae me': quod significet quod conjunctio externi cum interno nulla, sed interni cum externo, constat ex illis quae de Ecclesia apud gentem Judaicam et in illa gente supra n. 4899 
dicta sunt, quod nempe apud illam gentem fuerit Ecclesia, hoc est, internum conjunctum cum externo, sed in illa gente Ecclesia nulla, hoc est, externum non conjunctum cum interno; ut enim Ecclesia 
sit in gente, erit reciprocum. </p>
