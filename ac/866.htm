<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第866节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>866.</strong>“乌鸦”表虚假。这一点一般从前面有关鸟的阐述就能清楚看出来。鸟表觉性、理性和知识，同样表这些的对立面，即推理和虚假。在圣言中，这两方面的事物用各种鸟类来描述，真觉知之物用无害、美丽、洁净的鸟类来表示，而假觉知之物则用有害、丑陋、不洁的鸟类来表示，各自皆取决于所描述的真理或虚假的种类。粗俗、顽固的虚假用“猫头鹰”和“乌鸦”来描述：用“猫头鹰”是因为它们生活在黑夜中，而用“乌鸦”则因为它们是黑色的。如以赛亚书：<br />猫头鹰和乌鸦必住在其中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.11.htm">34:11</a>） <br />此处论及犹太教会，它是“猫头鹰和乌鸦”所描述的纯虚假的居所。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]866.</strong> The symbolism of the raven as falsity is established in general by explanations and illustrations above regarding birds [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_745" target=_top>745</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776" target=_top>776</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803" target=_top>803</a>], showing that they symbolize matters of understanding, reason, and fact, and the opposites of these, which are rationalization and falsity. The Word depicts both the positive and negative types in the different species of bird. Birds that are gentle, pretty, and clean portray true ways of understanding, but birds that are fierce, ugly, and unclean portray false ones, depending on the specific type of truth or falsity. Thick, dense falsity is depicted by owls and ravens — by owls because they inhabit the dark of night, by ravens because they are black. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />Owl and raven will live there. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_866/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_34_11" target=_top>Isaiah 34:11</a>)<br />These words occur in a passage that speaks of the Jewish church as containing sheer falsity,{*1} which the owl and raven depict.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's attitude toward Jews, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259" target=_top>259</a> and the reader's guide, pages 51-55. [JSR] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 866</b></p><p><b>866.</b>
That a "raven" signifies falsities, is evident in a general way from what has been said and shown above concerning birds, that they signify things of understanding, of reason, and of memory-knowledge, 
and also the opposite, which are reasonings and falsities. Both of these are described in the Word by various species of birds; truths of understanding by birds which are gentle, beautiful, and clean; 
and falsities by those which are ravenous, ugly, and unclean, in each case varying according to the species of truth or falsity. Gross and dense falsities are described by owls and ravens; by owls 
because they live in the darkness of night, and by ravens, because they are of a black color. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The owl also and the raven shall dwell therein (Isa. 34:11), where the Jewish Church 
is described as being the habitation of mere falsities, represented by the owl and the raven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 866</b></p><p><b>866.</b>
'A raven' means falsities. This in a general way becomes clear from what has been stated and shown already about birds meaning intellectual concepts, rational concepts, and facts, and in like manner 
the opposite of these, which are reasonings and falsities. Both sets of things are described in the Word by various species of birds, things of a true understanding by harmless, beautiful, and clean birds, 
those of a false understanding however by harmful, ugly, and unclean ones, each depending on the species of truth or falsity under description. Gross and impenetrable falsities are described by 
'owls' and 'ravens' - by owls because they live in the darkness of the night, by ravens because they are black; as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The owl and the raven will dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2034:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 34:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here the subject 
is the Jewish Church, and the fact that nothing but falsities, described as 'the owl and the raven', resided in it. </p>

</p><b>866.</b>
Quod per 'corvum' significentur falsitates, constare potest in genere ex illis quae prius de avibus dicta et ostensa sunt, quod significent intellectualia, rationalia et scientifica; et quod similiter 
opposita, quae sunt ratiocinia et falsa; illa et haec describuntur in Verbo per varias species avium; intellectualia vera per aves mites, pulchras et mundas; falsa autem per aves immites, impulchras, 
et immundas; et quidem secundum speciem veri et falsi; falsitates crassae et densae per 'noctuas et corvos,' per 'noctuas' quia in tenebris noctis vivunt, per 'corvos' quia colore sunt nigro; ut apud 
Esaiam, 	Noctua atque corvus habitabunt in ea, xxxiv 11; </p>
<p>ubi agitur de Ecclesia Judaica, quod ibi nihil nisi falsitates, quae etiam describuntur per 'noctuam et corvum.' </p>
