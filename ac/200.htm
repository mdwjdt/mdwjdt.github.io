<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>200.</strong>前面说（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.9.htm">2:9</a>），在园子当中的是生命树，此处却说是“分别善恶树”，这是因为，在园子“当中”代表着核心处。属天之人并上古教会的核心是“生命树”，亦即爱与爱所生之信。当前一代（可称为属天属灵之人），他们的核心是信。<br />要详述上古之人的特质并不容易，因为今时之人对此一无所知。他们的性情，与今日之人的性情大不相同。简单地说，他们是本乎良善而认识真理，或说本乎爱而明了信。那一代过去以后，他们的后裔具有完全不同的特质，不再是本乎良善而认识真理，或说本乎爱而明了信，而是通过真理来了解良善，或说通过信来了解爱，很多人甚至只是获取了一些知识而已。这是洪水之后所发生的变化，以防止世界走向毁灭。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]200.</strong> The present verse says that the tree of knowledge was in the middle of the garden, but <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_200/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_9" target=_top>Genesis 2:9</a> above says that the tree of lives was in the middle, implying that the tree of knowledge was not. The reason is that the middle of the garden symbolizes the inmost core. The core of the heavenly individual, or the earliest church, was the tree of lives, which is love and the faith that develops out of love. With the people of this ensuing generation (who could be called heavenly-spiritual people), the middle of the garden, or the core, was faith.<br />Further description is impossible because no one today has any idea at all what the people who lived in that earliest era were like. Their character was completely unlike any found in our own age.<br />Their character was such (to give just a small idea) that good taught them about truth; that is to say, love taught them what belonged to faith. But when that generation passed away, another with a completely different nature took its place. The new descendants did not learn from good about truth; they did not learn from love about faith's tenets. Instead, from truth they acquired facts about goodness. To put it another way, from religious knowledge they acquired facts about love. And many of them gained little more than facts.<br />This change was made after the Flood, to prevent the world's destruction. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 200</b></p><p><b>200.</b>
The reason why the "tree of knowledge" is here spoken of as being "in the midst of the garden" although previously (Gen. 2:9), the tree of lives was said to be in the midst of the garden, and not the 
tree of knowledge, is that the "midst" of the garden signifies the inmost; and the inmost of the celestial man, or of the Most Ancient Church, was the "tree of lives" which is love and the faith thence 
derived; whereas with this man, who may be called a celestial spiritual man, or with this posterity, faith was the "midst" of the garden, or the inmost. It is impossible more fully to describe the 
quality of the men who lived in that most ancient time, because at the present day it is utterly unknown, their genius being altogether different from what is ever found with anyone now. For the purpose 
however of conveying some idea of their genius, it may be mentioned that from good they knew truth, or from love they knew what is of faith. But when that generation expired, another succeeded of a 
totally different genius, for instead of discerning the true from the good, or what is of faith from love, they acquired the knowledge of what is good by means of truth, or what is of love from the knowledges 
of faith, and with very many among them there was scarcely anything but knowledge [quod scirent]. Such was the change made after the flood to prevent the destruction of the world. </p>

The reason the tree of knowledge is now said to be in the middle of the garden, whereas previously in 2:9 the tree of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is said to be in the middle of the garden, and not the tree of knowledge, is 
that 'the middle of the garden' means that which is inmost. And the inmost of the celestial man, or Most Ancient Church, was the tree of life,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> which was love and faith deriving from it. But the middle 
of the garden, or that which was the inmost of this next generation, that is, of the man who may be called celestial-spiritual, was faith. No further description is possible, for the character of 
the people who lived in those most ancient times is totally unknown at the present day. Their disposition was entirely different from that which is at all possible with anyone today. To convey some intelligible 
idea of that disposition, let the point be considered that it was from good that they came to know truth, that is, from love they came to know anything of faith. But when that generation died 
out another took its place whose disposition was entirely different. That is to say, the new generation did not from good come to know truth, or from love come to know the things of faith, but instead 
had from truth a knowledge of good, that is, had from the things constituting the cognitions of faith a knowledge of those of love; and with the majority it was scarcely anything more than knowledge. 
Such was the change which took place after the Flood to prevent the destruction of the world.

Quod arbor scientiae hic dicatur in medio horti, prius autem cap. ii vers. 9, arbor vitarum dicitur in medio horti, non ita arbor scientiae, est causa quod 'medium horti' significet intimum et quod 
caelestis hominis seu Antiquissimae Ecclesiae intimum fuerit arbor vitarum, quae est amor et inde fides; hujus autem homini' qui vocari potest homo caelestis spiritualis, seu hujus posteritatis medium 
horti seu intimum erat fides. Amplius describi nequit, qui: ignotissimum hodie est quales fuerunt illi qui antiquissimo illo tempore vixerunt; alia prorsus indoles iis fuit quam usquam apud aliquem hodie 
datur: quae indoles, ut solum idea ejus capiatur, fuit talis ut ex bono nossent verum, seu ex amore quid fidei; at cum generatio illa exspiravit, successit alia quae prorsus diversa indole erat ab 
iis; quae nempe non ex bono verum, seu ex amore quae fidei essent, nosset sed quae ex vero sciret bonum, seu ex illis quae sunt cognitionum fidei sciret quae sunt amoris, et apud plerosque vix aliud 
quam quod scirent.  Talis mutatio facta est post diluvium, ne periret mundus.
