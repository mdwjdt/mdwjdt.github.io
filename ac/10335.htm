<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10335节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10335</strong>.“我，看哪，我委派但支派中亚希撒抹的儿子亚何利亚伯与他同工”表那些处于信之良善和真理的人，教会将在他们当中建立。这从“亚何利亚伯”的代表清楚可知，“亚何利亚伯”是指那些处于信之良善和真理的人。这些人之所以由亚何利亚伯来代表，是因为他属但支派，而该支派表示那些处于信之良善和真理的人（参看<a href="3923.htm">3923</a>，<a href="6396.htm">6396</a>节）。这两个人，即犹大支派的比撒列和但支派亚何利亚伯，之所以被选中来执行这项将要代表神性属天和属灵事物的工作，是因为比撒列表示所有处于爱之良善的人，亚何利亚伯表示所有处于信之良善和真理的人。因此，比撒列表示那些在天堂和教会的至内在部分的人，而亚何利亚伯表示那些在天堂和教会的末后和最低部分的人。当按名提到那些至内在的人和那些末后和最低的人时，要理解为在整个天堂和整个教会里面的所有人。关于这个问题，可参看前文（<a href="10329.htm">10329</a>节）；当提到“首先的和末后的”时，要理解为所有事物（<a href="10044.htm">10044</a>节）。<br />此外，犹大支派也的确是众支派中为首先的，但支派则是它们当中为末后的。犹大支派的确是众支派中为首先的，这一事实从父亲以色列对犹大子孙的祝福明显看出来，可参看创世记49章，在那里，长子流便、西缅、利未受到诅咒，犹大却受到祝福（关于流便，可参看49:3，4；关于西缅，参看49:5-7；关于犹大，参看49:8-12）。但是众支派中为末后的（参看<a href="1710.htm">1710</a>，<a href="3929.htm">3929</a>，<a href="6396.htm">6396</a>节）。此外，那些处于对主之爱的良善之人住在至内层天堂，那些处于源于良善的信之真理之人则住在最低层或最外层天堂。<br />之所以说“处于源于良善的信之真理”，是因为信之真理若非源于良善，就不是存在于一个人里面的信之真理；事实上，真理是从良善生出的。因此，除非良善住在真理里面，否则真理里面就没有灵魂，从而没有生命。住在天堂最低层的，是那些处于源于良善的信之真理之人，而不是那些处于没有良善的信之真理之人；后者不在天堂居住。由于信之真理如同仆人那样服事爱之良善，正如末后之物服事首先之物，故经上论到亚何利亚伯说，耶和华委派他与比撒列同工，也就是作他的助手；论到比撒列，经上说耶和华以神的灵充满了他，使他有智慧，有聪明，有知识，能作各样的工作（31:3）。</p>

And I, behold I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. That this signifies those who are in the good and truth of faith, with whom the church is to be established, is 
evident from the representation of Aholiab, as being those who are in the good and truth of faith. That these are represented by Aholiab is because he was of the tribe of Dan, and by this tribe are signified 
those who are in the good and truth of faith (see n. 3923, 6396). The reason why these two, Bezalel of the tribe of Judah, and Aholiab of the tribe of Dan, were chosen to do the works by which 
were to be represented Divine celestial and spiritual things, was that by "Bezalel" are meant all who are in the good of love, and by "Aholiab" all who are in the good and truth of faith; thus by "Bezalel" 
are meant those who are in the inmost things, and by "Aholiab" those who are in the outermost things, of heaven and the church; and when the inmost and the outermost are mentioned, all are understood 
who are in the universal heaven and in the universal church (as may be seen above, n. 10329; and that when "first and last" are mentioned, all things are understood, n. 10044). [2] Moreover, 
the tribe of Judah was actually the first of the tribes, and the tribe of Dan was the last of them. That the tribe of Judah was actually the first of the tribes is evident from the blessing of his sons 
by their father Israel, see Genesis 49, where Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, who were the firstborn, are cursed, and Judah is blessed. (See concerning Reuben, verses 3 and 4 of that chapter; concerning Simeon 
and Levi, verses 5-7; and concerning Judah, verses 8-12.) (That Dan is the last of the tribes, see at n. 1710, 3929, 6396.) Moreover, in the inmost heaven are those who are in the good of love to 
the Lord, and in the outermost heaven are those who are in the truth of faith from good. [3] It is said "in the truth of faith from good," because the truth of faith is not the truth of faith with 
anyone unless it is from good, for truth is born from good; and therefore unless good is in truth, there is no soul in it, thus no life. Those who are in truths of faith from good are in the ultimates 
of heaven, but not those who are in truths of faith without good: these are not in heaven. As the truth of faith ministers to the good of love as what is last to what is first, therefore it is said of 
Aholiab that "Jehovah hath given him with Bezalel," that is, to serve him; and it is said of Bezalel that "Jehovah hath filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom, and in intelligence, and in knowledge, 
and in all work" (verse 3). </p>

'And I, behold, I have appointed with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, belonging to the tribe of Dan' means those in whom the good and truth of faith are present, among whom the Church is to be established. 
This is clear from the representation of 'Aholiab' as those in whom the good and truth of faith are present. The reason why these are represented by Aholiab is that he was from the tribe of Dan, 
and that tribe means those in whom the good and truth of faith are present, see <a href="3923.htm">3923</a>, <a href="6396.htm">6396</a>. And the reason why these two - Bezalel from the tribe of Judah, and Aholiab from the tribe of Dan - were 
chosen to carry out the work, by which Divine celestial and spiritual realities would be represented, was that by Bezalel all those in whom the good of love is present should be understood, and by Aholiab 
all those in whom the good and truth of faith are present. Thus those who are in the inmost parts of heaven and the Church should be understood by Bezalel, and those who are in the last and lowest 
parts of them by Aholiab. And when they who are inmost and those who are last and lowest are referred to by name, all who are within the whole of heaven and within the whole of the Church should be 
understood. For this matter, see above in <a href="10329.htm">10329</a>; and when reference is made to what is first and what is last all things should be understood, <a href="10044.htm">10044</a>. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The tribe of Judah was also in reality the first 
of the tribes, and the tribe of Dan the last of them. The fact that the tribe of Judah was in reality the first of the tribes is clear from father Israel's blessing of his sons in Genesis <a href="49.htm">49</a>, where 
Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, who were the firstborn, are cursed, and Judah is blessed. See regarding Reuben there, verses 3,4; regarding Simeon and Levi, verses 5-7; and regarding Judah, verses 8-12. And 
the fact that Dan was the last of the tribes, see <a href="1710.htm">1710</a>, <a href="3923.htm">3923</a>, <a href="6396.htm">6396</a>. The inmost heaven furthermore is inhabited by those in whom the good of love to the Lord exists, and the lowest by those in whom 
the truth of faith springing from good is present. The expression 'in whom the truth of faith springing from good is present' is used because the truth of faith is not the truth of faith present in a 
person unless it springs from good; for truth is born from good. Therefore unless good resides within truth there is no soul and so no life within it. Those in whom the truths of faith springing from 
good are present inhabit the lowest parts of heaven, but not those in whom the truths of faith are devoid of good; the latter do not inhabit heaven. Since the truth of faith acts as a servant to the good 
of love, as what is last does to what is first, it says of Aholiab that Jehovah appointed him to be with Bezalel, that is, to be his assistant; and of Bezalel it says that Jehovah filled him with 
the spirit of God in wisdom, and in intelligence, and in knowledge, and in all [manner of] work, verse 3.  </p>

`Et Ego ecce dedi cum illo Aholiabum filium Achisamachi tribui Dan': quod significet illos qui in bono et vero fidei apud quos Ecclesia instauranda, constat ex repraesentatione `Aholiabi' quod sint 
illi qui in bono et vero fidei; quod illi per Aholiabum repraesententur, est quia e tribu Danis erat, et per illam tribum significantur illi qui in bono et vero fidei sunt, videatur n. 3923, 6396. Quod 
hi duo, nempe Bezaleel e tribu Jehudae, et Aholiabus e tribu Danis, {1}electi sint ad faciendum opera, per quae repraesentarentur Divina caelestia et spiritualia, erat quia per Bezaleelem intelliguntur 
omnes qui in bono amoris {2}sunt, et per Aholiabum omnes qui in bono et vero fidei, ita per Bezaleelem illi qui in intimis caeli et Ecclesiae, et per Aholiabum illi qui in ultimis eorum sunt; et cum 
intimi (c)et ultimi nominantur, intelliguntur omnes qui in universo caelo et in universa Ecclesia, {3}de qua re videatur supra n. 10,329, et quod cum primum et ultimum dicuntur, intelligantur {4} omnia, 
n. 10,044. {5}Tribus Jehudae etiam actualiter erat prima tribuum, et tribus Dan ultima earum; quod tribus Jehudae actualiter esset prima tribuum, constat ex benedictione filiorum ab Israele patre, 
Gen. xlix, ibi Reuben, Schimeon, et Levi, qui primogeniti {6}, maledicuntur, ac Jehudah benedicitur; videatur de Reubene ibi, vers. 3, 4, de Schimeone et Levi, vers. 5-7, et de Jehudah, vers. 8-12; 
et quod Dan {7}sit ultima tribuum, videatur n. 1710, (x)3923, 6396; in {8} intimo {9}caelo etiam sunt qui in bono amoris in Dominum, et in ultimo qui in vero fidei ex bono. In vero fidei ex bono dicitur 
quoniam verum fidei non est verum fidei apud aliquem nisi sit ex bono, nascitur enim verum ex bono; quapropter nisi bonum in vero sit, non est anima in illo, ita non vita; {10} qui in veris fidei 
{11}sunt ex bono, sunt {12} in ultimis caeli, non autem qui in veris fidei absque bono (d)sunt, hi non in caelo sunt. Quoniam verum fidei ministrat bono amoris, sicut {13}ultimum primo, ideo dicitur de 
Aholiabo quod Jehovah dederit illum cum Bezaleele, quod est ad serviendum illi; ac de Bezaleele dicitur quod Jehovah impleverit illum spiritu Dei in sapientia, et in intelligentia, et in scientia, et 
in omni opere, vers. 3. @1 designati$ @2 ita qui in intimis coeli et Ecclesiae sunt, et per Aholiabum omnes qui in bono et vero fidei, ita qui in ultimis coeli et Ecclesiae$ @3 quod per Bezaleelem 
quia ex tribu Jehudae, intelliguntur illi qui in bono amoris sunt, ita qui in intimo coeli et Ecclesiae, et per Aholiabum quia ex tribu Dani, intelliguntur illi qui in vero fidei, ita qui in ultimo 
coeli et Ecclesiae, consequenter omnes, videatur etiam supra n. 10,329$ @4 i omnes seu$ @5 et quoque tribus Jehudae$ @6 i fuerunt$ @7 fuerit$ @8 i primo seu$ @9 coeli$ @10 i tales$ @11 habent
