These are the degrees of the neighbor, and according to these degrees charity ascends; but these are degrees in successive order, in which a prior or higher degree is always preferred to a posterior 
or lower one; and as the Lord is in the highest, and He is to be regarded in every degree as the end to which each tends, therefore He is above all, and is to be loved above all things.            EXODUS 
3 </p>
<p>     1. And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock behind the wilderness, and came unto the mountain of God, to Horeb.      2. 
And the angel of Jehovah was seen by him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bramble; and he saw, and behold the bramble burned with fire, and the bramble was in no wise consumed.      3. And 
Moses said, I will therefore go aside, and see this great vision, why the bramble is not burnt.      4. And Jehovah saw that he went aside to see, and God called unto him out of the midst of the bramble, 
and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Behold me!      5. And He said, Draw not nigh hither; pull off thy shoes from upon thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest a ground of holiness is this.  
    6. And He said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses covered his faces, because he was afraid to look upon God.      7. And Jehovah 
said, Seeing I have seen the affliction of My people, which is in Egypt, and I have heard their cry from before their taskmasters; for I have known their sorrows; </p>
<p>     8. And I am come down to liberate 
them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to make them come up out of that land unto a land good and broad, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, 
and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.      9. And now behold the cry of the sons of Israel is come unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians 
oppress them.      10. And now go, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, and do thou bring forth My people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.      11. And Moses said unto God, Who am I that I should 
go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?      12. And He said, Because I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou 
hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall worship God near this mountain.      13. And Moses said unto God, Behold I come unto the sons of Israel, and say to them, The God of your fathers 
hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is His name? What shall I say unto them?      14. And God said unto Moses, I AM WHO I AM; and He said, Thus shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, 
I AM hath sent me unto you.      15. And God said further unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is My name forever, and this is My memorial unto generation and generation.      16. Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah the 
God of your fathers hath been seen of me, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, saying, Visiting I have visited you, and that which is done to you in Egypt.      17. And I say, I will make you 
come up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.  
    18. And they shall hear thy voice, and thou shalt go in, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt; and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah God of the Hebrews hath met us; and now let us 
go we pray a way of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.      19. And I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, and not by a strong hand.      20. 
And I will put forth My hand, and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof, and afterward he will send you away.      21. And I will give this people favor in the eyes of 
the Egyptians; and it shall be that when ye go, ye shall not go empty.      22. And every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of 
gold, and garments; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters, and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. </p>

Such are the degrees of the neighbour, and it is in accordance with them that charity ought to increase in scale. But these degrees are those of consecutive order, in which a prior or higher degree always 
takes precedence over a posterior or lower one; and since the Lord occupies the highest degree and one should look to him in each specific degree as the End to which they all rise, He must be loved 
above all people and all things. </p>

Hi gradus sunt proximi, et secundum hos gradus ascendet charitas; sed hi gradus sunt gradus {1}in ordine successivo, in quo praefertur semper prior seu superior gradus posteriori seu inferiori, et quia

the following note: in sequenti de amicitia, quod non debeat trahere aliquid ex amore$ CAPUT III 	1.  Et Moscheh fuit pascens gregem Jethronis soceri sui sacerdotis Midianis, et duxit gregem post desertum, 
et venit ad montem DEI Chorebum. 	2.  Et visus angelus JEHOVAE ad illum in flamma ignis e medio rubi; et vidit, et ecce rubus ardebat igne, et rubus nullatenus consumebatur. 	3.  Et dixit Moscheh, 
Secedam ergo, et videbo visionem magnam hanc, quare non comburitur rubus. 	4.  Et vidit JEHOVAH quod secederet ad videndum, et vocavit ad illum DEUS e medio rubi, et dixit, Moscheh, Moscheh, 
et dixit, Ecce me. 	5.  Et dixit, Ne appropinques huc, detrahe calceos tuos e super pedibus tuis, (x)quia locus quo tu stas super, humus sanctitatis ille. 	6.  Et dixit, Ego DEUS patris tui, DEUS Abrahami, 
DEUS Jischaki, et DEUS Jacobi; et obtexit Moscheh facies suas, quia timuit ab intuendo DEUM. 	7.  Et dixit JEHOVAH, Videndo vidi afflictionem populi Mei, qui in Aegypto, et clamorem illorum audivi 
a coram exactoribus illius, quia novi dolores illius. 	8.  Et descendi ad liberandum illum e manu Aegyptiorum, et ad ascendere faciendum illum e terra illa ad terram bonam et latam, ad terram fluentem 
lacte et melle, ad locum Cananaei et Chittaei, et Emorraei et Perisaei, et Chivaei et Jebusaei. 	9.  Et nunc ecce clamor filiorum Israelis venit ad Me, et etiam vidi oppressionem qua Aegyptii 
opprimunt illos. 	10.  Et nunc ito, et mittam te ad Pharaonem, et educ populum Meum filios Israelis ex Aegypto. 	11.  Et dixit Moscheh ad DEUM, Quis ego quod eam ad Pharaonem, et quod educam filios 
Israelis ex Aegypto? 	12.  Et dixit, Quia ero cum te; et hoc tibi signum quod Ego miserim te, in educendo te populum ex Aegypto, coletis DEUM juxta montem hunc. 	13.  Et dixit Moscheh ad DEUM, Ecce 
ego venio ad filios Israelis, et dico illis, DEUS patrum vestrorum misit me ad vos, et dicant mihi, Quodnam nomen Ejus? quid dicam ad illos? 	14.  Et dixit DEUS ad Moschen, SUM QUI SUM, et dixit, Ita 
dices filiis Israelis, SUM misit me ad vos. 	15.  Et dixit adhuc DEUS ad Moschen, Ita dicas ad filios Israelis, JEHOVAH DEUS patrum vestrorum, DEUS Abrahami, DEUS Jischaki, et DEUS Jacobi, misit me 
ad vos; hoc nomen Meum in aeternum, et hoc memoriale Meum in generationem, generationem. 	16.  Ito et congreges seniores Israelis, et dicas ad illos, JEHOVAH DEUS patrum vestrorum visus est ad me, DEUS 
Abrahami, Jischaki, et Jacobi, (x)dicendo, Visitando visitavi vos, et quod factum vobis in Aegypto. 	17.  Et dico, Ascendere faciam vos ex afflictione Aegypti ad terram Cananaei et Chittaei, et Emorraei 
et Perisaei, et Chivaei et Jebusaei, ad terram fluentem lacte et melle. 	18.  Et audiverint vocem tuam, et intres tu et seniores Israelis ad regem Aegypti, et dicatis ad illum, JEHOVAH DEUS Hebraeorum 
occurrit nobis, et nunc eamus quaeso viam trium dierum in desertum, et sacrificemus JEHOVAH DEO nostro. 	19.  Et Ego novi quod non dabit vobis rex Aegypti ad eundum, et non manu forti. 	20. 
 Et mittam manum Meam, et percutiam Aegyptum omnibus mirabilibus Meis, quae faciam in medio illius; et postea mittet vos. 	21.  Et dabo gratiam populi hujus in oculis Aegyptiorum, et erit cum itis, 
non ibitis vacui. 	22.  Et petat mulier e vicina sua, et ex hospita domus suae, vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes, et ponetis super filios vestros, et super filias vestras, et depraedabimini Aegyptios. </p>
