Everyone in whom the Church is, is saved. But everyone in whom the Church is not, is condemned.            EXODUS 37 </p>
<p>     1. And Bezalel made the ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half the length 
thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.      2. And he overlaid it with pure gold, from within and from without, and made for it a border 
of gold round about.      3. And he cast for it four rings of gold upon the four corners thereof; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.      4. And he made 
staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.      5. And he put the staves into the rings upon the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.      6. And he made a propitiatory of pure gold; two 
cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.      7. And he made two cherubs of gold, solid made he them, at the two extremities of the propitiatory.      8. One 
cherub at the extremity on this side, and one cherub at the extremity on the other side; out of the propitiatory made he the cherubs at the two extremities thereof.      9. And the cherubs were spreading 
out their wings upward, covering over with their wings upon the propitiatory, and their faces were a man toward his brother; toward the propitiatory were the faces of the cherubs.      10. And 
he made the table of shittim wood; two cubits the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.      11. And he overlaid it with pure gold, and he made for 
it a border of gold round about.      12. And he made for it a closure of a handbreadth round about; and made a border of gold for the closure thereof round about.      13. And he cast for it four 
rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that belonged to the four feet thereof.      14. Over against the closure were the rings, receptacles for the staves to carry the table.     
 15. And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.      16. And he made the vessels that were upon the table; the little dishes thereof, and the cups thereof, 
and the salvers thereof, and the little brooms thereof, with which it should be covered, of pure gold.      17. And he made the lampstand of pure gold; solid made he the lampstand; its shaft, and 
its reed, its cups, its pomegranates, and its flowers, were from it.      18. And six reeds going out of the sides thereof; three reeds of the lampstand out of the one side thereof, and three reeds of 
the lampstand out of the other side thereof.      19. Three almond-shaped cups in one reed, a pomegranate and a flower; and three almond-shaped cups going out from one reed, a pomegranate and a flower; 
so for the six reeds going out of the lampstand.      20. And in the lampstand four almond-shaped cups; its pomegranates and its flowers.      21. And a pomegranate under two reeds out of it, and 
a pomegranate under two reeds out of it, and a pomegranate under two reeds out of it, for the six reeds going out of it.      22. Their pomegranates and their reeds were out of it; the whole of it 
one solid of pure gold.      23. And he made the lamps thereof, seven; and the tongs thereof, and the basins thereof, of pure gold.      24. Of a talent of gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.  
    25. And he made the altar of incense of shittim wood; a cubit the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, foursquare; and two cubits the height thereof; out of it were its horns.  
    26. And he overlaid it with pure gold, its roof, and its walls round about, and its horns; and he made for it a border of gold round about.      27. And two rings of gold made he for it from under 
its border, upon the two ribs thereof, upon its two sides, for receptacles for the staves, to carry it in them.      28. And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.      
29. And he made the holy oil of anointing, and the incense of spices, pure, with the work of the perfumer. </p>
