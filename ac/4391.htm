<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4391节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4391.</strong>“又为牲畜搭棚”表那时在良善与真理上同样增长。这从“牲畜”和“搭棚”或帐棚的含义清楚可知：“牲畜”是指总体上的良善与真理；“搭棚”或帐棚是指与“盖造房屋”的意思类似的某种事物，也就是接受源自真理的良善的增长。“盖造房屋”和“搭棚”或帐棚的不同之处在于：“盖造房屋”是不那么总体上的，因而是更内在的；而“搭棚”或帐棚则是更为总体上的，因而是更外在的。房屋旨在为他们自己，也就是为雅各，他的女眷和孩子；而棚旨在为仆人，羊群和牛群。在圣言中，严格来说，“棚”（Booths）或“帐棚”（tents）表示真理的神圣，与帐幕（tabernacles）是有区别的，帐幕因以下事实也被称为“帐棚”，即“帐棚”表示良善的神圣（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="4128.htm">4128</a>节）。在原文，用于棚的这个词就是“疏割”，而用于帐幕或帐棚的词则是“Ohalim”。真理的神圣就是源自真理的良善。<br />这就是被称为“疏割”的“棚”或“帐棚”的含义，这一点从以下圣言经文明显看出来。诗篇：<br />耶和华神坐着基路伯飞行；祂藉着风的翅膀快飞；祂以黑暗为藏身之处，以水的黑暗、天空的厚云为祂四围的帐棚（即疏割）。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.10.htm">18:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.11.htm">11</a>）<br /><br />祂又使天下垂，亲自降临，有黑云在祂脚下；祂坐着基路伯飞行，在风的翅膀上显现；祂以黑暗和聚集的水，天空的厚云为祂四围的帐棚（即疏割）。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下22.10.htm">22:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下22.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这论及神性启示或圣言。“祂又使天下垂，亲自降临”表示将圣言的内层真理隐藏起来；“有黑云在祂脚下”表示与内层真理相比，显现给世人的事物如同黑暗，圣言的字义就具有这样的性质。“坐着基路伯”表示它以这种方式被提供；“以黑暗为祂四围的的帐棚”表示在其隐藏之处，也就是字义里面的真理的神圣；“聚集的水”和“天空的厚云”表示文字上的圣言。“天空的厚云”表示文字上的圣言（参看创世记18章序言，以及<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。<br />以赛亚书中的这些话所表相同：<br />耶和华必在锡安山的一切居所，并她的会众以上，白日创造烟云，黑夜创造火焰的光，因为在全荣耀之上必有遮蔽。必有帐棚（即疏割），白日可以得阴凉，也可以作为避难所和隐匿处，躲避洪水暴雨。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.5.htm">4:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.6.htm">6</a>）；<br />此处“云”也表示圣言的字义；“荣耀”表示内义，如在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>），马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.26.htm">13:26</a>）和路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.27.htm">21:27</a>）那样。“帐棚”在此也表示真理的神圣。之所以说内层真理在“隐匿处”，是因为它们若被揭开，就会遭到亵渎（参看<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>节），这一点在诗篇中以这些话来表达：<br />你必把他们藏在你面前的隐密处，免得遇见人的计谋；你必暗暗地保守他们在帐棚（即疏割）里，免受口舌的争闹。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗31.20.htm">31:20</a>）<br />“帐棚”表示真理的神圣，这一点也明显可见于阿摩司书：<br />到那日，我必建立大卫倒塌的帐棚（即疏割），堵住其中的破口。把那破坏的建立起来，重新修造，像永恒之日一样。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.11.htm">9:11</a>）<br />“建立大卫倒塌的帐棚”表示在真理的神圣灭亡之后，重新恢复它；“大卫”表示神性真理方面的主（<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节），因为“王”表示神性真理（<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>节）。由于“帐棚”表示真理的神圣，“住在帐棚里”表示由此衍生的敬拜，因而帐棚节，也就是所谓的“住棚节”，在犹太人和以色列人的教会中设立（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.34.htm">23:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.42.htm">42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.43.htm">43</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.13.htm">16:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.16.htm">16</a>）；在那里，该节日还被称为“疏割节”或“住棚节”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4391</b></p><p><b>4391.</b>
And made booths for his acquisition.* That this signifies likewise in general an increase in good and truth then, is evident from the signification of "acquisition," as being goods and truths in general; 
and from the signification of "making booths" or tents, as being like that of building a house, namely, to receive an increase of good from truth, with the difference that "building a house" is less 
general, thus is more interior; and "making booths" or tents is more general, thus more external. The former was for themselves (that is, for Jacob, his women and children), the latter was for the 
servants, the flocks, and the herds. "Booths" or "tents" in the Word properly signify the holy of truth, and are distinguished from tabernacles, which are also called, "tents," by the fact that the latter 
signify the holy of good (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 4128). In the original language the former are called "Succoth," but the latter "Ohalim." The holy of truth is the good which is from truth. [2] 
That this is the signification of the booths or tents which are called "Succoth," is evident also from the following passages in the Word. In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah God rode upon a cherub and did fly, 
and was carried upon the wings of the wind; He made darkness His hiding place, and His surroundings His tent [succoth], darkness of waters, clouds of the heavens (Ps. 18:11-12). And again: </p>
<p>     He 
bowed the heavens when He came down, and thick darkness was under His feet; and He rode upon a cherub and did fly, and was carried upon the wings of the wind; and He put darkness round about Him for 
tents (succoth), bindings of the waters, clouds of the heavens (2 Sam. 22:10-12); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is Divine revelation or the Word. To "bow the heavens when He came down" denotes to hide 
the interiors of the Word; "thick darkness under His feet" denotes that the things which appear to man are relatively darkness (such is the literal sense of the Word.) To "ride upon a cherub" denotes 
that it was so provided; to "put darkness round about Him for tents," or "His surroundings for His tent," denotes the holy of truth in its hiding place, namely, within the literal sense; the "bindings 
of the waters" and "clouds of the heavens," denote the Word in the letter. (That the "clouds of the heavens" denote the Word in the letter, may be seen above, preface to Gen. 18, and n. 4060.) [3] 
The like is signified by these words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will create over every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and over her convocations, a cloud by day, and a smoke and the shining of a flame of 
fire by night; for over all the glory there shall be a covering. And there shall be a tent [succah] for a shade by day, and for refuge and hiding against flood and rain (Isa. 4:5-6); </p>
<p>a "cloud" here 
also denotes the literal sense of the Word; and "glory," the internal sense; as also in Matthew 24:30; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27; a "tent" here also denotes the holy of truth. Interior truths are said to 
be in "hiding," for the reason that if they had been revealed, they would in that case have been profaned (see n. 3398, 3399, 4289); which is also set forth by these words in David: </p>
<p>     Thou hidest 
them in the hiding place of Thy faces from the ensnaring counsels of a man; Thou hidest them in a tent [succah] by reason of the strife of tongues (Ps. 31:21). [4] That a "tent" denotes the holy of 
truth is evident also in Amos: </p>
<p>     In that day will I set up the tent [succah] of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches, and I will set up the ruins, and I will build according to the days 
of eternity (Ps. 9:11); </p>
<p>to "set up the tent of David that is fallen," denotes to restore the holy of truth after it has perished; "David" denotes the Lord relatively to Divine truth (n. 1888), for a 
"king" denotes Divine truth (n. 2015, 2069, 3009). As a "tent" signified the holy of truth, and "dwelling in tents," the derivative worship, therefore the feast of tents, which is called the "feast of 
tabernacles," was instituted in the Jewish and Israelitish Church (Lev. 23:34, 42, 43; Deut. 16:13, 16); where also this feast is called the "feast of Succoth," or "of tents." * Latin, acquisitio. 
The Hebrew mikneh means what is acquired, but is always used of cattle, in which the riches of nomads consist. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4391</b></p><p><b>4391.</b>
'And made booths for his cattle' means a similar increase in good and truth at that time. This is clear from the meaning of 'cattle' as goods and truths in general, and from the meaning of 'making booths', 
which are tents, as something similar to what is meant by 'building a house', namely receiving an increase of good from truth. The two phrases differ in that 'building a house' means that which 
is less general, and so rather more internal, while 'making booths', or tents, means that which is more general, and so rather more external. The house was intended for themselves, that is to say, for 
Jacob, his womenfolk and children, the booths for the servants, flocks and herds. In the Word 'booths' or tents, strictly speaking, means the holiness of truth, and they are distinguished from tabernacles, 
which too are called tents, by the fact that the latter mean the holiness of good, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="4128.htm">4128</a>. The word in the original language for booths is 'succoth', whereas that for tabernacles 
is 'ohalim'. The holiness of truth is the good which springs from truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This meaning carried by the booths or tents called 'succoth' is further evident from the following places in the 
Word: In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah God rode on a cherub, and flew, and was borne on the wings of the wind. He made darkness His hiding-place, and His surroundings His tent - darkness of waters, clouds of the 
heavens <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
He bowed the heavens when He came down, and thick darkness was under His feet. And He rode on a cherub, and new, and was borne on the wings of the wind And 
He made tents of darkness around Him, clusters of water, clouds of the heavens. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2022:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 22:10-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Divine revelation, or the Word. 'Bowing the heavens when He came down' stands for hiding 
the interior truths of the Word. 'Thick darkness under His feet' stands for the fact that compared with interior truths, those visible to man are like darkness, the literal sense of the Word being 
of such a nature. 'Riding on a cherub' stands for the fact that it was provided in this way. 'Making tents of the darkness around Him' or 'making His surroundings His tent' stands for the holiness of 
truth concealed in its hiding-place, that is to say, inwardly - within the literal sense. 'Clusters of waters and clouds of the heavens' means the Word in the letter. Regarding 'clouds of the heavens' 
meaning the Word in the letter, see Preface to Chapter <a href="18.htm">18</a> of Genesis, and <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same is meant by the following in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will create over every habitation of mount Zion, and 
over her assemblies, a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a covering. And there will be a tent for shade by day, and for a refuge 
and hiding-place from deluge and rain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%204:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 4:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here again 'cloud' means the literal sense of the Word and 'the glory' the internal sense, as they do in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2024:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2021:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 21:27</a>. Again 
also 'a tent' stands for the holiness of truth. Interior truths are said to be in a hiding- place for the reason that if they had been revealed they would have been made profane, see <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>, a point that is also expressed in the following words in David, </p>
<blockquote>
In the hiding-place of Your face You conceal them from the treacherous plans of man; You hide them in a tent from the strife of 
tongues. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2031:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 31:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that 'a tent' means the holiness of truth is also evident in Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day I will raise up the tent of David that is fallen down, and I will close up the breaches, 
and I will raise up its destroyed places, and I will build it as in the days of old. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Raising up the tent of David that is fallen down' stands for reestablishing the holiness of 
truth after it has perished. 'David' stands for the Lord as regards Divine Truth, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, since 'a king' means Divine Truth, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>. Because 'tent' meant the holiness of truth and 'dwelling in 
tents' means worship that was the product of this, the feast of tents, called the feast of tabernacles, was established in the Jewish and Israelitish Church, Lev. <a href="23.htm">23</a>-<a href="34.htm">34</a>, <a href="42.htm">42</a>, <a href="43.htm">43</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:13,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16:13, 16</a>, where 
also that feast is called the feast of succoth, or of tents. </p>

`Et acquisitioni suae fecit tuguria': quod significet similiter in communi, bono et {1} vero tunc, constat ex significatione `acquisitionis' quod sint bona et vera in communi; </p>
<p>et ex significatione 
`facere tuguria' seu tentoria quod sit simile cum `aedificare domum,' nempe accipere incrementum boni a vero, cum differentia quod `aedificare domum sit minus commune, ita interius, et `facere tuguria' 
seu tentoria sit communius, ita exterius; illud erat pro ipsis, nempe Jacobo, ejus feminis et natis, hoc pro servitiis, gregibus et armentis; `tuguria' seu tentoria in Verbo proprie significant 
sanctum veri, et distinguuntur tabernaculis, quae etiam tentoria vocantur, per id {2} quod haec significent sanctum boni, n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 4128; illa in lingua originali appellantur `succoth,' 
haec autem `ohalim': sanctum veri est bonum quod a vero.  [2] Quod significatio tuguriorum seu tentoriorum quae vocantur succoth, illa sit, patet quoque ab his locis in Verbo: apud Davidem,  
         Jehovah Deus equitavit super cherubo, et volavit, et      vectus super alis venti, posuit tenebras absconsionem Suam,      et circuitus Suos tentorium Suum, tenebrae aquarum, nubes     
 caelorum, Ps. xvi 11, 12 [A.V. 10, 11]: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Inclinavit caelos cum descendit, et densae tenebrae si      pedibus Ipsius: et equitavit super cherubo, et volavit, et      vectus super 
alis venti, et posuit tenebras circum Se      tentoria, ligatur aquarum, nubes caelorum, 2 Sam. xxii 10- </p>
<p>     12; </p>
<p>ubi {3} de revelatione Divina seu Verbo; `inclinare caelos cum descendit' pro abscondere 
interiora Verbi; `densae tenebrae sub pedibus Ipsius' pro quod illa quae apparent homini', sint tenebrae respective; sensus litteralis Verbi est talis; `equitare super cherubo' pro quod ita 
provisum; `ponere tenebras circum Se tentoria,' seu `circuitus Suos tentorium Suum' pro sanctum veri in abscondito, nempe intus in sensu litterali; `ligaturae aquarum et nubes caelorum' sunt {4} 
Verbum in littera; quod `nubes caelorum' sit Verbum in littera, videatur Praefatio ad cap. xviii Gen. et n. 4060: [3] (m)simile significatur {5} per haec apud Esaiam,           Creabit Jehovah super 
omne habitaculum montis Zionis,  et super convocationes ejus, nubem interdiu, et fumum et  splendorem ignis flammae noctu, nam super omni gloria obtegumentum; et tentorium erit in umbram interdiu, 
et in refugium et absconsionem contra inundationem et pluviam, iv   5, 6; </p>
<p>`nubes' quoque hic est sensus `litteralis Verbi', et `gloria' sensus internus, ut quoque apud Matthaeum xxiv 30; Marcum xiii 
26; </p>
<p>Lucam xxi 27; tentorium quoque {6} hic pro sancto veri.  Quod dicatur quod interiora vera sint in abscondito, est ob causam si revelata fuissent, quod tunc illa profanavissent {7}, videatur 
n. 3308, 3399, (x)4289; quod etiam exponitur per haec verba apud Davidem,           Occultas eos in abdito facierum Tuarum prae insidiosis      consiliis viri, abscondis eos in tentorio prae lite  
    linguarum, Ps. xxxi 21 [A.V. 20]. [4] Quod `tentorium' sit sanctum veri, patet etiam apud Amos,           In die illo erigam tentorium Davidis lapsum, et      obsepiam rupturas, et destructa 
erigam, et aedificabo juxta      dies aeternitatis, ix 11; </p>
<p>`erigere tentorium Davidis lapsum' pro sanctum veri restaurare postquam periit; `David' pro Domino respective ad Divinum Verum, n. 1888, 
`rex' enim est Divinum Verum, n. 2015, 2069, 3009.  Quia `tentorium' significabat sanctum veri, et `habitare tentoria' significabat cultum inde, ideo festum tentoriorum, quod vocatur festum tabernaculorum, 
in Ecclesia Judaica et Israelitica, institutum erat, Lev. xxiii 34, 42, 43; Deut. xvi 13, 16, ubi etiam festum illud vocatur festum succoth seu tentoriorum.      @1 as AI but cf 4388, l.
