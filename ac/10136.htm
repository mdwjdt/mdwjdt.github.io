<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10136节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10136</strong>.“要用细面一伊法的十分之一，调和捣成的油一欣四分之一”表源于属天良善的属灵良善，量足够结合所需。这从“一伊法的十分之一”、“细面”、“油”和“一欣四分之一”的含义清楚可知：“一伊法的十分之一”是指足够的量，就是足够目的或功用所需的量（参看<a href="8468.htm">8468</a>，<a href="8540.htm">8540</a>，<a href="9757.htm">9757</a>节）；“细面”是指源于良善的真理（<a href="9995.htm">9995</a>节），在此是指源于属天良善的真理，这真理被称为属灵良善；“油”是指属天良善（<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="3728.htm">3728</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>，<a href="9474.htm">9474</a>，<a href="9780.htm">9780</a>节）；“一欣四分之一”是指足够结合所需的量。因为“四”表示结合（<a href="9601.htm">9601</a>，<a href="9674.htm">9674</a>节），因此“四分之一”或第四个部分表示一个足够实现结合所需的量。伊法和欣都是度量单位，量度表示正在论述的事物的量。“一伊法”，就是细面、小麦或大麦的量度，表示良善的量；“一欣”就是酒或油的量度，表示真理的量。所表示的是一伊法的十分之一，这一点从利未记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.20.htm">6:20</a>）和其它经文清楚看出来。由此明显可知，“要用细面的十分之一，调和捣成的油一欣四分之一”表示源于属天良善的属灵良善，量足够结合所需。至于何为属灵良善，何为属天良善，可参看9277节所提到的地方。</p>

And a tenth of fine flour mingled with beaten oil, a fourth of a hin. That this signifies spiritual good from celestial as much as is sufficient for conjunction, is evident from the signification of 
"a tenth of an ephah," as being as much as is sufficient, and sufficient for uses (see n. 8468, 8540, 9757); from the signification of "fine flour," as being truth from good (n. 9995), here truth from 
celestial good, which truth is called spiritual good; from the signification of "oil," as being celestial good (n. 886, 3728, 4582, 4638, 9474, 9780); and from the signification of "a fourth of a hin" 
as being sufficient for conjunction; for by "four" is signified conjunction (n. 9601, 9674), hence "a fourth," or fourth part, denotes as much as is sufficient for conjunction. The ephah and hin were 
measures, and by "measure" is signified the quantity of the thing that is being treated of; by an "ephah," which was a measure of fine flour, wheat, and barley, the quantity of good; and by a "hin," 
which was a measure of wine and oil, the quantity of truth. (That the tenth of an ephah is what is meant, is evident from Leviticus 6:20, and other passages.) From this it is evident that by "a tenth 
of fine flour mingled with beaten oil, a fourth of a hin," is signified spiritual good from celestial as much as is sufficient for conjunction. (What the spiritual and what the celestial are, see the 
places cited in n. 9277.) </p>

'And a tenth [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with beaten oil, a quarter of a hin' means spiritual good derived from celestial good, the amount needed for a joining together. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'a tenth of an ephah' as a sufficient amount, and the amount needed for the purposes which have to be served, dealt with in <a href="8468.htm">8468</a>, <a href="8540.htm">8540</a>, <a href="9757.htm">9757</a>; from the meaning of 'fine flour' as truth derived 
from good, dealt with <a href="9995.htm">9995</a>, at this point truth derived from celestial good, which truth is called spiritual good; from the meaning of 'oil' as celestial good, dealt with in <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="3728.htm">3728</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, <a href="9474.htm">9474</a>, <a href="9780.htm">9780</a>; and from the meaning of 'a quarter of a hin' as the amount needed for a joining together. For 'four' means a joining together, <a href="9601.htm">9601</a>, <a href="9674.htm">9674</a>, so that 'a quarter' or a fourth part means an amount 
sufficient to accomplish that joining together. The ephah and the hin were measures, and by measures the amount of the thing that is being referred to is meant. By 'an ephah', which was a measure 
of fine flour, wheat, or barley, the amount of good is meant, and by 'a hin', which was a measure of wine or oil, the amount of truth is meant. The fact that a tenth of an ephah is what should be understood 
by 'a tenth' is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:20</a>, and elsewhere. From all this it is evident that 'a tenth of fine flour mixed with beaten oil, a quarter of a hin' means spiritual good derived from celestial 
good, the amount needed for a joining together. What spiritual good is and what celestial good is, see the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>.

`Et decima similae mixtae oleo tuso, quadrans hinis': quod significet bonum spirituale ex caelesti quantum ad conjunctionem, constat ex significatione `decimae ephae' quod sit quantum satis et quantum 
ad usus, de qua n. 8468, 8540, 9757; ex significatione `similae' quod sit verum ex bono, de qua n. 9995, hic verum ex bono caelesti, quod verum vocatur {1} bonum spirituale; ex significatione `olei' 
quod sit bonum caeleste, de qua n. 886, 3728, 4582, 4638, 9474, 9780; ex significatione `quadrantis hinis' quod sit quantum ad conjunctionem, nam per `quattuor' significatur conjunctio, n. 9601, 9674, 
inde quadrans seu quarta pars est quantum satis ad illam; epha et in erant mensurae, et per mensuras significatur quantitas rei de qua agitur; per epham, quae erat mensura similae, tritici, et hordei, 
quantitas boni, et per hinem, quae erat mensura vini et olei, quantitas veri; quod decima ephae sit quae intelligitur, constat ex Lev. vi 13 [A.V. 20], et alibi.  Inde patet quod per `decimam similae 
mixtae oleo tuso quadrantis hinis' significetur bonum spirituale ex caelesti quantum ad conjunctionem.  Quid spirituale et quid caeleste, videantur loca citata n. 9277. @1 est$ </p>
