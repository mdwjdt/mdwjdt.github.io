<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2728节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2728.</strong>正如刚才所说的，如今很少有人知道何为真正的婚姻之爱，故现在我们通过已向我透露的事来描述这爱。婚姻之爱起源于良善与真理的神性婚姻，因而起源于主自己。婚姻之爱由此而来，这一事实人既看不到，也理解不了。不过，它仍能通过流注、对应和圣言变得清晰起来。通过流注：从主流入的善与真的结合好比婚姻，并被称作婚姻。通过对应：当与真理结合的良善向下流入较低领域时，它会形成心智的结合；再降至更低领域时，它便形成一个婚姻。因此，心智的结合源于来自主的与真理结合的良善，该结合便是婚姻之爱本身。</p>

And because, as was said, few at this day know what genuine conjugial love is, it shall be described from what has been discovered to me. Conjugial love takes its origin from the Divine marriage of good 
and truth, and thus from the Lord Himself. That conjugial love is from this, is not apparent to sense nor to apprehension; but still it may be seen from influx and from correspondence, as well as 
from the Word. From influx, inasmuch as heaven, from the union of good and truth, which inflows from the Lord is compared to a marriage, and is called a marriage: from correspondence, since, when good 
united to truth flows down into a lower sphere, it forms a union of minds; and when into one still lower, it forms a marriage: wherefore union of minds from good united to truth from the Lord, is conjugial 
love itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2728</b></p><p><b>2728.</b>
Now because few at the present day know what genuine conjugial love is, as has been stated, that love will now be described from things that have been disclosed to me. Conjugial love has its origin in 
the marriage of Divine Good and Truth, and so in the Lord Himself. But the derivation of conjugial love from that marriage cannot be seen by man, neither by sensory perception nor by mental apprehending; 
but it may nevertheless become clear to him from influx and from correspondence, as well as from the Word. It may become clear from influx, in that from the union of good and truth which flow in 
from the Lord, heaven is compared to a marriage, and is called a marriage; from correspondence, in that when good united to truth flows down into a lower sphere it presents itself as a union of minds, 
and when it flows down into a lower sphere still it presents itself as a marriage. Consequently the union of minds springing from good united to truth from the Lord is conjugial love itself. </p>

</p><b>2728.</b>
Et quia pauci hodie, ut dictum, sciunt quid genuinus amor conjugialis, ex illis quae detecta sunt, describetur. Amor conjugialis originem ducit a conjugio Divino Boni et Veri, ita ab Ipso Domino: quod 
inde amor conjugialis, non apparet ad sensum et captum, sed usque constare potest ex influxu et ex correspondentia, praeter ex Verbo: ab {1} influxu, caelum ex unione boni et veri quae influit a Domino, 
comparatur conjugio, et vocatur conjugium; ex correspondentia, cum bonum unitum vero defluit in sphaeram inferiorem, sistit illud unionem mentium, cum in adhuc inferiorem, sistit conjugium: quare 
unio mentium ex bono unito vero a Domino, est ipse amor conjugialis. 	@1 ex.$ </p>
