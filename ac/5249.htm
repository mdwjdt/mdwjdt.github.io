<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5249节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5249.</strong>“进到法老面前”表与新属世层的交流。这从“进到”的含义和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“进到”在此是指通过流注的一种交流；“法老”是指新属世层（参看<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>，<a href="5080.htm">5080</a>，<a href="5244.htm">5244</a>节）。至于本节这些话包含什么，这从对它们的解释明显看出来；因为这些话描述了约瑟如何从坑里被释放出来，进到法老面前。“约瑟”在内义上代表属灵层的属天层方面的主；而“法老”代表属世人或外在人。关约瑟的“坑”代表属灵层的属天层方面的主所承受的试探状态；而他被法老从坑里召上来表示从试探当中释放的状态，以及随后的流注并与新属世层交流的状态。由此明显可知内义在此描述了主如何将祂的属世层变新，最终变成神性。<br />这些就是当世人读到这段历史时，属天天使所想到的事。而且，思想这类事是他们最大的快乐。因为他们生活在主的神性气场中，因而仿佛在主里面。当思想主，思想主通过在祂自己里面将人身变成神性时，他们会感知到最深的喜乐。为叫天使能持续体验这最属天的喜乐，同时体验智慧，圣言的内义充分描述了这一神性过程。内义同时包括了人重生的过程，因为人的重生就是主荣耀的形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。许多人或许想知道天使们彼此谈论什么，因而死后变成天使的人谈论什么。要让那些有如此好奇心的人知道，天使们谈论的是包含在圣言内义中的那类事，也就是说，他们谈论主的荣耀，祂的国度、教会，以及人藉由爱之良善和信之真理的重生。但他们谈论这些事时所用的观念极其深邃、玄奥，绝大部分无法描述。</p>

And came unto Pharaoh. That this signifies communication with the new natural, is evident from the signification of "coming," as here being communication by influx; and from the representation of Pharaoh, 
as being the new natural (see n. 5079, 5080, 5244). What the words in this verse involve is manifest from what has been unfolded, for they treat of Joseph, how he was freed from the pit and came 
unto Pharaoh. By Joseph in the internal sense is represented the Lord as to the celestial of the spiritual, and by Pharaoh is represented the natural or external man; by the pit in which Joseph was is 
represented the state of the Lord's temptation as to the celestial of the spiritual; and by his being called from the pit by Pharaoh is signified the state of deliverance from temptations, and further, 
the subsequent state of influx and communication with the new natural. From this it is plain that in the internal sense is here described how the Lord made His natural new, and at last Divine.  [2] 
These are the things the celestial angels think when this history is being read by man; moreover, to think such things is to them most delightful, for they are in the Lord's Divine sphere, thus as 
it were in the Lord, and in a perception of inmost joy when thinking of the Lord and of the salvation of the human race by the Lord's making Divine the Human in Him; and in order that the angels might 
be kept in this most heavenly joy, and at the same time in wisdom, that Divine process is fully described in the internal sense of the Word, and at the same time therein the process of man's regeneration; 
for the regeneration of man is an image of the Lord's glorification (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402). Some may possibly wonder what the angels converse together about, and consequently what men 
who become angels converse about after death; but be it known to them that it is about such things as are contained in the internal sense of the Word, namely, about the Lord's glorification, His kingdom, 
the church, the regeneration of man through the good of love and the truth of faith; but they speak about these things by means of secret things that are for the most part inexpressible. </p>

'And came to Pharaoh' means a communication with the new natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming' in this instance as a communication through influx; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' 
as the new natural, dealt with in <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>, <a href="5080.htm">5080</a>, <a href="5244.htm">5244</a>. What the words in this verse hold within them is evident from the explanations of them that have been given; for those words describe how Joseph 
was set free from the pit and came to Pharaoh. In the internal sense 'Joseph' represents the Lord so far as the celestial of the spiritual is concerned, while 'Pharaoh' represents the natural or external 
man. 'The pit' in which Joseph was confined represents a state of temptation endured by the Lord which involved the celestial of the spiritual, while his being called from the pit by Pharaoh means 
a state of release from temptations, and also a state of influx and communication after that with the new natural. From all this it is evident that the internal sense contains a description at this point 
of how the Lord made His Natural new and at length Divine. </p>

 These are the matters that celestial angels contemplate when such historical details are read by man. To contemplate such matters 
is also their greatest delight, for they live in the Lord's Divine sphere and so they are as it were in the Lord. They know the deepest joy when they are thinking about the Lord and about the salvation 
of the human race, which took place because the Lord made the Human within Himself Divine. Also, to enable angels to go on experiencing that most heavenly joy and at the same time wisdom, a full description 
of that Divine process has therefore been given in the internal sense of the Word. This sense includes at the same time the process by which man is regenerated, for man's regeneration is an 
image of the Lord's glorification, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>. Many will perhaps be wondering what angels talk about to one another and consequently what people after death who become angels talk about. 
Let those who so wonder know that angels talk about the kinds of matters that are contained in the internal sense of the Word, that is to say, about the Lord's glorification, His kingdom, the Church, 
the regeneration of man by means of the good of love and the truth of faith. But when they do so they use profound ideas which for the most part are beyond description. </p>

`Et venit ad Pharaonem': quod significet communicationem cum novo naturali, constat a significatione `venire' {1}quod sit communicatio hic per influxum; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit novum 
naturale, de qua n. 5079, 5080, 5244. Quid {2}haec quae in hoc versu, involvunt, patet ab illis quae explicata sunt; agitur enim de Josepho quomodo is ex fovea {3}liberatus est et ad Pharaonem venit; 
per `Josephum' in sensu interno repraesentatur Dominus {4}quoad caeleste spiritualis, et per `Pharaonem' repraesentatur {5}naturalis seu externus homo; per `foveam in qua Josephus', repraesentatur 
status tentationis Domini quoad caeleste spiritualis, et per `vocationem e fovea a Pharaone' significatur status liberationis a tentationibus, et porro status influxus et communicationis dein cum novo 
naturali; ex his patet quod in sensu interno describatur hic quomodo Dominus Naturale Suum novum fecit, et tandem Divinum; [2] haec sunt quae angeli caelestes cogitant cum historica haec leguntur ab 
homine; talia cogitare etiam illis jucundissimum est, nam sunt in sphaera Divina Domini, ita quasi in Domino, et tunc in perceptione intimi gaudii sunt cum in cogitatione de Domino et de salvatione generis 
humani, per quod Dominus Humanum in Se Divinum fecerit; utque angeli in caelestissimo illo gaudio detinerentur et simul in sapientia, ideo Divinus ille processus in sensu interno Verbi plene descriptus 
est; et simul in illo processus regenerationis hominis, regeneratio enim hominis est imago glorificationis Domini, n. "x"3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402. Plures fortassis miraturi sunt quid inter 
se loquuntur angeli, consequenter quid inter se homines post mortem qui fiunt angeli; sed sciant quod talia sint quae in sensu interno Verbi continentur, nempe de glorificatione Domini, de regno Ipsius, 
de Ecclesia, de regeneratione hominis per bonum amoris et verum fidei, {6}sed de his per arcana quae quoad perplurimam partem ineffabilia sunt. @1 ad aliquem quod sit influere, et per influxum communicare$ @2
