<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6286.</strong>创世记48:17-20.约瑟看见他父亲把右手按在了以法莲的头上，这在他眼里不对，便抓住他父亲的手，要从以法莲头上挪到玛拿西的头上。约瑟对他父亲说，我父，不是这样，这本是长子，求你把右手按在他的头上。他父亲不肯，说，我知道！我儿，我知道！他也必成为一个人民，而且也要为大；只是他的弟弟将来比他还大，他的种他的种要充满列族。当日就给他们祝福说，以色列要指着你祝福说，愿神使你如以法莲、玛拿西一样。于是，他立以法莲在玛拿西之前。<br />“约瑟看见他父亲把右手按在了以法莲的头上”表一种觉知，即：他认为真理要占据第一位。“这在他眼里不对”表不悦。“便抓住他父亲的手”表一种流注进入他的模糊觉知所拥有的能力。“要从以法莲头上挪到玛拿西的头上”表将他从错误中转移开。“约瑟对他父亲说，我父，不是这样，这本是长子”表对良善的一种可察觉的流注，即：第一位属于这良善，或说这良善拥有优先权。“求你把右手按在他的头上”表那良善因此要占据第一位。“他父亲不肯”表不同意。“说，我知道！我儿，我知道”表尽管事情是这么回事，但表象却不同。“他也必成为一个人民，而且也要为大”表源于良善的那真理，因而属天人也要增长。“只是他的弟弟将来比他还大”表来自真理的那良善，因而属灵人会获得更大的增长。“他的种他的种要充满列族”表那真理，即信之真理要占主导。“当日就给他们祝福”表持续到永远的预见和天意。“说，以色列要指着你祝福说，愿神使你如以法莲、玛拿西一样”表好叫他自己的属灵层能居于理解力的真理和意愿的良善中。“于是，他立以法莲在玛拿西之前”表他认为真理占据第一位，因为他是属灵的。</p>

Verses 17-20. And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand, upon the head of Ephraim, and it was evil in his eyes; and he laid hold of the hand of his father to remove it from upon Ephraim's head 
upon Manasseh's head. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know; he also 
shall be for a people, and he also shall become great; and nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall be the fullness of the nations. And he blessed them in this 
day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh; and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.  "And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim," 
signifies a perception that he accounted truth as being in the first place; "and it was evil in his eyes," signifies displeasure; "and he laid hold of the hand of his father," signifies influx into 
the power of his obscure perception; "to remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head," signifies to turn him away from error; "and Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father, for this 
is the firstborn" signifies perceptible influx with respect to good that it has priority; "put thy right hand upon his head," signifies that thus it should be in the first place; "and his father refused," 
signifies no consent; "and said, I know, my son, I know," signifies that so it is, but that it appears otherwise; "he also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great," signifies that 
truth from good also shall be increased, thus the celestial man; "and nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he," signifies that good from truth shall receive more increase, thus the 
spiritual man; "and his seed shall be the fullness of the nations," signifies that the truth of faith shall reign; "and he blessed them in this day," signifies foresight and providence eternally; "saying, 
In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh," signifies that his own spiritual may be in the truth of the intellectual and in the good of the will; "and he set Ephraim 
before Manasseh," signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place, because he was spiritual. </p>

Verses 17-20 And Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim's head, and it was wrong in his eyes; and he grasped his father's hand to remove it from upon Ephraim's head onto Manasseh's 
head. And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn; place your right hand on his head. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know; he too will be a people, 
and he too will become great; but truly his younger brother will become greater than he, and his seed will be the fullness of nations.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And he blessed them on this day, saying, In you will Israel 
bless, saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he put Ephraim before Manasseh.  </p>
<p>'And Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim's head' means a discernment that he 
considered truth to occupy the first place. 'And it was wrong in his eyes' means displeasure. 'And he grasped his father's hand' means an influx into the power which his obscure discernment possessed. 
'To remove it from upon Ephraim's head onto Manasseh's head' means to divert him from error. 'And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn' means a perceptible influx 
regarding good, that the first place belonged to this. 'Place your right hand on his head' means that good should accordingly occupy the first place. 'And his father refused' means non-compliance. 'And 
said, I know, my son, I know' means that though that is true the appearance is different. 'He too will be a people, and he too will become great' means that truth from good also, thus the celestial 
man, will be increased. 'But truly his younger brother will become greater than he' means that good from truth, thus the spiritual man, will receive even greater increase. 'And his seed will be the fullness 
of nations' means that truth - the truth of faith - will be predominant. 'And he blessed them on this day' means Foresight and Providence continuing for ever. 'Saying, In you will Israel bless, 
saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh' means so that its own spiritual may reside in the truth of the understanding and the good of the will. 'And he put Ephraim before Manasseh' means 
that because he was spiritual he considered truth to occupy the first place.

Vers. 17-20.  Et vidit Joseph quod posuit pater ejus manum dextram suam super capite Ephraimi, et malum fuit in oculis ejus, et apprehendit manum patris sui ad removendum illam a super capite Ephraimi, 
super caput Menashis.  Et dixit Joseph ad patrem suum, Non ita pater mi, quia hic primogenitus, pone dextram tuam super capite ejus.  Et renuit pater ejus, et dixit, Scio, fili mi, scio, etiam hic 
erit ad populum, et etiam hic magnus fiet, et verumtamen frater ejus minor magnus fiet prae illo, et semen illius erit plenitudo gentium.  Et benedixit illis in die hoc, dicendo, In te benedicet Israel, 
dicendo, Ponat te Deus sicut Ephraimum et sicut Menashen:  et posuit Ephraimum ante Menashen.  `Et vidit Joseph quod posuit pater ejus (x)manum dextram suam super capite Ephraimi' significat apperceptionem 
quod primo loco reputaret verum:  `et malum fuit in oculis ejus' significat displicentiam:  `et apprehendit manum patris sui' significat influxum in potentiam apperceptionis ejus obscurae:  
`ad removendum illam a super capite Ephraimi super caput Menashis' significat ad declinandum eum ab errore:  `et dixit Joseph ad patrem suum, Non ita pater mi, quia hic primogenitus' significat influxum 
perceptibilem de bono quod ei prioritas:  `pone dextram {1} super capite ejus' significat quod sic primo loco: `et renuit pater ejus' significat non consensum:  `et dixit, Scio, fili mi, scio' significat 
quod ita sit sed quod appareat aliter:  `etiam hic erit {2}in populum, et etiam hic magnus fiet' significat quod verum ex bono etiam augebitur, ita caelestis homo:  `et verumtamen frater ejus minor 
magnus fiet prae illo' significat quod bonum ex vero plus incrementi capiet, ita spiritualis homo:  `et semen illius erit plenitudo gentium' significat verum quod fidei regnaturum:  `et benedixit 
illis in die hoc' significat praevidentiam et providentiam in aeternum: `dicendo, In te (x)benedicat Israel, dicendo, Ponat te Deus sicut Ephraimum et sicut Menashen' significat ut spirituale suum sit 
in vero intellectualis et bono voluntarii:  `et posuit Ephraimum ante Menashen' significat quod primo loco reputaret verum, quia spiritualis. @1 A I here and 6292 o tuam; see above$ @2 thus A I here
