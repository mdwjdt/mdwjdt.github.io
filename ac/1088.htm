<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1088节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1088.</strong>“他们背着脸，就看不见父亲的赤身”表这是应该做的，并且不应在意诸如由推理所产生的错误和过失之类的事。这一点从这句是一个重复的事实清楚可知，因为前面刚说了同样的事，因此，这些话同时也是一个总结。这个母教会，或该教会成员具有这样的特点，即他行事没有恶意，只出于简单的心思，这从接下来经上说“挪亚醒了酒”，即得到更好的指教明显看出来。<br />至于此处所论述的主题，我们可以说，那些没有仁爱的人只思想邻人的邪恶，并且只谈论邪恶。他们即便谈论善事，那也是为了他们自己，或为了他们戴着友谊的面具而刻意讨好的那个人。但那些拥有仁爱的人只思想邻人的良善，并且只谈论良善，这不是为了他们自己，也不是为了他们试图要讨好的那个人，而是通过主在仁爱中这样作工。前者就象与人同在的恶灵，后者就象与人同在的天使。恶灵只会激起人的恶与假，并谴责他；而天使只会激起善与真，并原谅恶与假。由此明显可知，恶灵主宰没有仁爱的人，这人通过他们与地狱相联；而天使主宰拥有仁爱的人，这人通过他们与天堂相联。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1088.</strong> Their faces were backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness, means that this is the proper thing to do, and that we should not concentrate on such wrongs, which are blunders and downfalls resulting from misguided thinking. This can be seen from the repetition involved, since these words are almost exactly the same as those directly above. Taken together, they also bring the matter to an end, because in this parental church — or in a person in this church — misdeeds sprang not from depravity but from naiveté. This is indicated in the very next verse, which says that Noah woke up from his wine, or in other words, learned better.<br />[2] To delve more deeply into the subject: People lacking in charity think nothing but evil and speak nothing but evil of their neighbor. If they have anything good to say, it is only for their own benefit, or else it is an attempt to ingratiate themselves with the person, under the guise of friendship. But people who love their neighbor think nothing but good and speak nothing but good of others. They do so not for their own sake or to curry favor with another but because it is what results when the Lord stirs their sense of charity.<br />The former are like the evil spirits and the latter like the angels we have with us. Evil spirits always arouse bad impulses and false ideas in us, and they condemn us. Angels, though, arouse only good impulses and true ideas, and whatever is evil or false they excuse. All of this shows that individuals lacking in charity are under the control of evil spirits, who keep us in touch with hell, while individuals endowed with charity are under the control of angels, who keep us in touch with heaven. </p>

And their faces were backward, and they saw not the nakedness of their father. That this signifies that so it ought to be done, and that such things as errors and mistakes from reasonings should not 
be attended to, is evident from the repetition; for nearly the same things are said here as just before, and therefore these words make at the same time a conclusion. For such was the character of this 
parent church, or of the man of this church, that he did not act in this way from malice, but from simplicity, as is evident from what presently follows, where it is said that "Noah awoke from his wine" 
that is, was better instructed. As regards the matter here treated of, we may say that those who are in no charity think nothing but evil of the neighbor, and say nothing but evil; if they say anything 
good, it is for their own sake, or for the sake of him whom they flatter under the appearance of friendship; whereas those who are in charity think nothing but good of their neighbor and speak 
only well of him, and this not for their own sake or the favor of another whom they flatter, but from the Lord thus working in charity. The former are like the evil spirits, the latter are like the angels, 
who are with a man. The evil spirits excite nothing but what is evil and false in the man, and condemn him; but the angels excite nothing but what is good and true, and excuse what is evil and false. 
From this it is evident that with those who are in no charity the evil spirits rule, through whom the man communicates with hell; and that with those who are in charity the angels rule, through 
whom he communicates with heaven. </p>

'Their faces were backwards, and they did not see their father's nakedness' means that this is what ought to be done and that no notice ought to be taken of such things as errors and faults resulting 
from reasonings. This is clear from the fact that this statement is a repetition, for this wording is almost the same as that immediately previous and the conclusion to it. For this parent Church, or 
therefore also serves as the conclusion to it. For this parent Church, or member of this Church, was such that it acted in this fashion not out of evil-mindedness but in simplicity, as becomes clear 
from what follows next where it is said that 'Noah awoke from his wine', that is, was better informed. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 In regard to the subject under discussion, people with whom no charity is present think nothing 
else than evil of the neighbour and speak nothing but evil. If they say anything good it is for the sake of themselves or of one with whom they seek to curry favour under an outward show of friendship. 
But people in whom charity is present think nothing else than good of the neighbour and speak nothing but good, and this not for their own sake or that of him with whom they seek to curry favour, 
but from the Lord thus at work within charity. The former are like evil spirits, the latter like angels, residing with someone. Evil spirits never do anything else than stir up a person's evils and 
falsities and condemn him. Angels however stir up nothing but goods and truths; and things that are evil and false they excuse. From these considerations it is clear that with those in whom no charity 
is present evil spirits have dominion, through whom man communicates with hell; and with those in whom charity is present angels have dominion, through whom man communicates with heaven. </p>

Quod 'facies eorum retrorsum, et nuditatem patris sui non viderunt' significent quod ita faciendum, et non attendendum ad talia quae errores et lapsus sunt ex ratiociniis, constat a repetitione, nam 
fere eadem dicuntur hic quae mox prius, quare haec simul faciunt quoque conclusum; nam talis erat Ecclesia haec parens seu homo hujus Ecclesiae, quod non ex malitia sed ex simplicitate hoc fecerit, ut 
constare potest ex mox sequentibus ubi dicitur quod 'expergefactus Noah e vino suo,' hoc est, quod melius instructus.  [2] Quod rem attinet, qui in nulla charitate sunt, nihil nisi quam male cogitant 
de proximo, nec nisi quam male loquuntur; si bonum, est sui gratia, vel illius cui adblandiuntur sub amicitiae specie; at qui in charitate sunt, nihil nisi quam bene cogitant de proximo, et nihil nisi 
quam bene loquuntur, et hoc non sui et alius gratia, cui adblandiantur, sed ita Domino in charitate operante: priores illi sunt similes malis spiritibus, hi angelis, qui apud hominem; mali spiritus 
nusquam nisi mala et falsa hominis excitant, et eum condemnant; angeli vero nihil nisi bona et vera, et quae mala et falsa sunt, excusant; ex quibus constat, quod apud eos qui in nulla charitate sunt, 
dominentur mali spiritus, per quos communicat homo cum inferno; et quod apud eos qui in charitate, dominentur angeli, per quos communicat cum caelo. </p>
