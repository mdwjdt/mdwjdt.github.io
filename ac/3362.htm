<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3362节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />3362.21章对亚比米勒有过一次描述，那时他与亚伯拉罕立约，亚伯拉罕因他仆人所霸占的水井而指责他。在本章，几乎同样的情形又发生在亚比米勒与以撒之间；在这方面也很相似，即如亚伯拉罕那样，以撒也称他的妻子为妹子。由此明显可知，类似事件再次发生，并又被讲述出来（两次事件都提到了水井）的原因包含一个神性奥秘在里面。若非有某种神性事物隐藏其中，知道这些事对我们来说没有任何价值。然而，内义教导隐藏在其中的事和以下事实，即：所论述的主题是主通过真理与那些在祂天上和地上国度里之人的结合；与天使的结合是通过属于更高层级的真理表象；与世人的结合是通过属于较低层级的真理表象，因而通过圣言结合，这些表象就存在于圣言的内在意义和外在意义中。<br />因为神圣真理本身具有这样的性质，它们永远不可能为任何天使所理解，更不可能为任何世人所理解，因为它们远远超出其理解力的整个范畴。然而，为了主能与天使并世人结合，神圣真理在表象中流入进来，既与天使同在，也与世人同在；当神圣真理在这类表象中与他们同在时，它们既能被接受，也能得到承认。这一切通过适合每个人理解的方式成就；因此，表象，也就是天使和人类的真理存在于三个层级中。这些就是包含在内义里面的神性奥秘，就是21章有关亚比米勒与亚伯拉罕的行为，和本章有关亚比米勒与以撒行为的那些论述的内义。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. In the twenty-first chapter Abimelech was treated of, in that he made a covenant with Abraham, and that then Abraham reproved him concerning a well of waters which his servants had 
seized. In the present chapter a nearly similar occurrence is repeated between Abimelech and Isaac, resembling it also in this respect, that just as Abraham had said that his wife was his sister, so 
also said Isaac; from which it is evident that some Divine arcanum therein is the reason why these things occurred a second time, and were again related; and also that on both occasions mention is made 
of wells, concerning which it would little concern us to know, unless something Divine were concealed therein. But the internal sense teaches what is therein, and that the subject is the conjunction 
through truths of the Lord with those who are in His kingdom in the heavens and on earth; with the angels through appearances of truth of a higher degree; and with men through appearances of truth 
of a lower degree; consequently through the Word, in the internal and external senses of which are contained these appearances. For truths Divine themselves are such that they can never be comprehended 
by any angel, still less by any man, because they surpass every faculty of their understanding. Yet in order that there may be conjunction of the Lord with them, truths Divine flow in with them in appearances; 
and when truths Divine are with them in such appearances, they can be both received and acknowledged. This is effected by adaptation to the comprehension of each person; and therefore appearances, 
that is, truths angelic and human, are of three degrees. These are the Divine arcana contained in the internal sense of that which was related in a former chapter concerning the doings of Abimelech 
and Abraham; and in this chapter concerning those of Abimelech and Isaac. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Included in Chapter <a href="21.htm">21</a> is the description of a time when Abimelech made a covenant with Abraham, and when Abraham reproached him about a well of water that his servants had seized. 
Here a very similar description occurs again, involving Abimelech and Isaac, similar also in that, as Abraham had done, so also did Isaac call his wife his sister. From these considerations it is 
evident that the reason why similar events occurred again and are told again - with the mention of wells in both incidents - involves a Divine arcanum within it. Except for that which is Divine being 
concealed within them, there would be no value in knowing anything about those events. The internal sense however teaches what is concealed there and the fact that the subject is the Lord when joined 
to those who are in His Kingdom in heaven and on earth by means of truths - to angels by means of the appearances of truth belonging to a higher degree, and to men by the appearances of truth belonging 
to a lower degree, consequently by means of the Word where, in the internal sense and in the external sense, those appearances exist. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For Divine truths are such that they cannot possibly be grasped 
by any angel, still less by any man. They go far beyond the whole range of their understanding. Yet so that the Lord may be joined to angels and men Divine truths flow in, with both angels and 
men, within appearances; and when those appearances have Divine truths within them, then these Divine truths can be received and acknowledged. And this is done in such a way as is adequate for everyone 
to grasp them. Appearances therefore, that is, angelic and human truths, exist in three degrees. These are the Divine arcana that are contained in the internal sense within the deeds done and told involving 
Abimelech and Abraham in Chapter <a href="21.htm">21</a>, and these involving Abimelech and Isaac in this. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Actum est in capite xxi de Abimelecho quod pepigerit foedus cum Abrahamo, et quod tunc Abraham redarguerit illum de puteo aquarum quem eripuerant servi illius; hic paene simile recurrit 
ter Abimelechum et Jishakum, etiam in eo quod sicut Abraham dixerat uxorem suam esse sororem, ita quoque Jishakus; ex quibus patet quod Divinum arcanum inibi sit cur iterum evenerunt, (c)et iterum 
relata sunt, et quoque quod memoretur utrobivis de puteis; de quibus aliquid scire, nisi Divinum inibi reconditum sit, non tanti foret; sensus autem internus docet quid inibi est, et quod agatur de 
conjunctione Domini cum illis qui in regno Ipsius in caelis et in terris per vera, et quidem per (t)veri apparentias superioris gradus cum angelis, et per (t)veri apparentias inferioris gradus cum hominibus, 
consequenter per Verbum in cujus sensu interno et externo sunt illae: ipsa enim Vera Divina sunt talia ut nusquam ab aliquo angelo, 2 minus ab aliquo homine, capi possint; excedunt omnem facultatem 
intellectus eorum; ut usque conjunctio sit Domini cum illis, influunt Vera Divina apud illos in apparentiis, in quibus cum illa sunt, et recipi possunt et agnosci; hoc fit adaequate ad cujusvis 
captum; quare apparentiae, hoc est, vera angelica et humana, triplicis gradus sunt: haec arcana Divina sunt quae in illis de Abimelecho et Abrahamo, et in his de Abimelecho et Jishako actis et relatis, 
in sensu interno continentur. </p>
