<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8042节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8042.</strong>“凡头生的，都要分别为圣归我”表信，它来自主。这从“分别为圣归耶和华”和“头生的”的含义清楚可知：“分别为圣归耶和华或主”是指将某种事物归于祂，也就是坦白并承认它来自祂；“头生的”是指信（参看<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="2435.htm">2435</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>节）。当说到“信”时，所指的是属灵教会所拥有的一切真理；由于所指的是属灵教会所拥有的一切真理，故也指属灵教会本身，因为真理是该教会的本质要素。诚然，良善才是一个教会的本质要素，是实际上的长子或头生的（<a href="2435.htm">2435</a>，<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>，<a href="4926.htm">4926</a>，<a href="4928.htm">4928</a>，<a href="4930.htm">4930</a>节）；但那些属于属灵教会的人所拥有的良善本身是真理。事实上，当他们照其教义所教导的真理行事时，这真理就被称为良善；因为那时它从他们的理解力进入了他们的意愿，从他们的意愿进入了行为，凡出于意愿所行的，都被称为良善。就其本身和本质而言，该良善是真理；这是因为对这些人来说，教会的教义是真理，由于教会里的教义多种多样，所以真理也是多种多样。然而，尽管它们如此千差万别，但当人们意愿并行出这些真理时，它们仍会变成良善，如刚才所述。<br />当一个人正在重生时，他通过理解力或教义中的信被引向意愿或生活中的信，也就是通过信之真理被引向仁之良善。当一个人处于仁之良善时，他就已经重生了，这时便从该良善产生被称为良善之真理的真理。这些就是系最真正的信之真理的真理；它们由“头生的”或长子来表示。因为来自良善的真理的世代或出生就像来自一对父母的儿女，以及后来孙子和孙女，再后来曾孙和曾孙女等等的世代或出生。直接来自父母的第一代，或由父母本身所生的那些人，即儿女那一代，就是“头生的”或长子所表示的，无论他们有多少人；但不是指第二和第三代，除非相对于他们自己的父母。这些头生的或长子之所以分别为圣归耶和华或主，是因为真理和良善的所有第二代或以后的世代都从最初的世代获得它们的本质。这种属灵事物或属灵实体就是圣言中所论及的长子名分或长子权利的根源。</p>

Sanctify to Me all the firstborn. That this signifies faith, that it is from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "sanctifying to Jehovah" or the Lord, as being to ascribe to Him, that is, 
to confess and acknowledge that it is from Him; and from the signification of "the firstborn," as being faith (see n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035). When it is said "faith," there is meant all the truth that 
belongs to the spiritual church; and as there is meant all the truth of the church, the spiritual church itself is also meant, for truth is the essential of this church. Good is indeed the essential 
of the church, and is actually the firstborn (n. 2435, 3325, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930); but the good which those have who belong to the spiritual church is in itself truth; for when they act according to 
the truth which is of their doctrine, then the truth is called good, having then passed from the understanding into the will and from the will into act, and that which is done from the will is called 
good. That in itself and in its essence this good is nevertheless truth, is because to them the doctrinal things of the church are truths, and the doctrinal things in churches differ, consequently so 
do the truths; and yet although they are so various, by willing them and doing them they become goods, as just now said.  [2] While a man is being regenerated, he is led by means of faith in the understanding, 
or in doctrine, to faith in the will or life, that is, by means of the truth of faith to the good of charity; and when a man is in the good of charity, he has then been regenerated, and then 
from this good he produces truths, which are called the truths of good. These are the truths which are the veriest truths of faith, and which are meant by "the firstborn;" for it is with the begettings 
or births of truths from good, as it is with the begettings or births of sons and daughters from a parent, and afterward of grandsons and granddaughters, and thereafter of great-grandsons and great-granddaughters; 
and so on. The first or immediate begetting or birth, which is that of sons and daughters, is what is signified by "the firstborn," however many these may be; but not the second and 
the third begettings or births, except relatively to their own parents. The reason why these are sanctified to Jehovah or the Lord, is that all derivative or descending truths and goods derive their 
essence from the primitive ones. In this spiritual thing is founded the right of the firstborn that is spoken of in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8042</b></p><p><b>8042.</b>
'Sanctify to Me all the firstborn' means faith - that it comes from the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'sanctifying' to Jehovah or the Lord, as ascribing something to Him, that is, confessing 
or acknowledging that it comes from Him; and from the meaning of 'the firstborn' as faith, dealt with in <a href="352.htm">352</a>, <a href="2435.htm">2435</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>. When the term faith is used all the truth that the spiritual Church possesses 
is meant; and since all the truth that the Church possesses is meant, the spiritual Church itself is also meant, for truth is the essential element of this Church. Good is, it is true, the essential 
element of a Church, and really is the firstborn, <a href="2435.htm">2435</a>, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>, <a href="4926.htm">4926</a>, <a href="4928.htm">4928</a>, <a href="4930.htm">4930</a>; but good as it exists among those belonging to the spiritual Church is in itself truth. For when these people 
act in accordance with the truth they have been taught, that truth is called good; for it has then passed from their understanding into their will, and from their will into action, and anything done 
which springs from the will is called good. In itself, in essence, this good is still truth, and this is because for those people things taught by the Church are truths; and since teachings within Churches 
are diverse, so too are truths. But in spite of that, though they vary so much, such truths become good, as has just been stated, when people will them and act them out. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 While a person is 
being regenerated he is led by means of faith in the understanding, or doctrine, to faith in the will, or life; that is, he is led through the truth of faith to the good of charity. When the good of charity 
resides with a person he has been regenerated; and from that good he now gives birth to truths which are called the truths of good. These are the truths which are the most authentic truths of faith; 
and they are meant by the firstborn. For the generations or births of truths from good are like the generations or births of sons and daughters from a parent, later on of grandsons and granddaughters, 
then of great-grandsons and great granddaughters, and so on. The first generation or those born from the actual parent, the generation of sons and daughters, is what is meant by 'the firstborn', 
however many they may be; the second and third generations are not meant, except when considered in relation to their own parents. The reason why the firstborn were consecrated to Jehovah or the Lord 
is that all secondary or descending generations of truths and forms of good derive their essential nature from the primary ones. This spiritual reality is at the root of the right of the firstborn spoken 
of in the Word. </p>

`Sanctifica Mihi omne primogenitum': quod significet fidem quod a Domino, constat ex significatione `sanctificare' Jehovae seu Domino, quod (x)sit addicare Ipsi, hoc est, confiteri et agnoscere quod 
ab Ipso; et ex significatione `primogeniti' quod sit fides, de qua n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035; cum dicitur fides, intelligitur omne verum quod Ecclesiae spirituali; et quia intelligitur omne verum Ecclesiae, 
etiam intelligitur ipsa Ecclesia spiritualis, nam hujus Ecclesiae essentiale est verum; est quidem bonum essentiale Ecclesiae, et est actualiter primogenitus, n. 2435, 3325, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930; 
sed bonum quod illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in se est verum; cum enim agunt secundum verum quod doctrinae illorum, tunc verum appellatur bonum, {1} transivit tunc ab intellectu in voluntatem 
et a voluntate in actum; quod fit ex voluntate, hoc dicitur bonum; quod hoc bonum usque in se et sua essentia sit verum, est quia illis doctrinalia Ecclesiae sunt vera, et doctrinalia in Ecclesiis discrepant, 
{2}proinde etiam vera, et usque tamen licet tam varia sunt, per velle illa et agere illa fiunt bona, ut modo dictum est. 	2 Cum regeneratur homo, ducitur ille per fidem intellectu seu doctrina 
ad fidem voluntate seu vita, hoc est, per verum fidei ad bonum charitatis; cum homo in bono charitatis est, tunc regeneratus est; et tunc ex bono illo gignit vera, quae vera boni vocantur; haec vera 
sunt quae sunt ipsissima vera fidei, quae per `primogenita' intelliguntur; se habent enim generationes seu nativitates verorum a bono sicut se habent generationes seu nativitates filiorum ac filiarum 
a parente, et postmodum nepotum (c)et neptum, dein pronepotum (c)et proneptum, et sic porro; prima seu immediata generatio {3}aut nativitas, quae est filiorum et filiarum, est quae (x)significatur per 
`primogenitum,' quotcumque sint; non autem altera et tertia, nisi respective ad suos parentes; quod illa sanctificata sint Jehovae seu Domino, est quia omnia vera et bona derivativa seu descendentia 
trahunt suam essentiam a {4} primitivis.  In hoc spirituale fundatur jus primogenitorum de quo in Verbo. 	@1 i nam$ 	@2 ita quoque$ 	@3 seu$ 	@4 i veris et bonis$ </p>
