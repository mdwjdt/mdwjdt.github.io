<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1491节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1491.</strong>“法老就召了亚伯兰来”表主的回忆。这从“法老”表知识的含义清楚可知。主在孩童时所吸收的知识本身，就是记忆知识在此被称为“法老”。因此，向主如此说话的正是知识本身，也就是说，耶和华藉着知识这样做。由此明显可知，此处这些话表主的回忆。觉悟经由知识、因而经由表知识的法老（如前所述）而来。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1491.</strong> The meaning of Pharaoh called Abram as the fact that the Lord remembered can be seen from the symbolism of Pharaoh as secular learning. Secular knowledge itself, or the facts themselves that the Lord drank in when he was young, are being called Pharaoh here. As a result, it is factual knowledge itself that addresses the Lord in this way, or rather it is Jehovah speaking through factual knowledge. The reader can see from this that the present clause means that the Lord remembered. Awareness comes through the facts we learn and so through Pharaoh, who symbolizes secular knowledge, as noted. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1491</b></p><p><b>1491.</b>
And Pharaoh called Abram. That this signifies that the Lord bethought Himself, is evident from the signification of "Pharaoh," as being memory-knowledge. The memory-knowledge itself [scientia], that 
is, the matters of memory-knowledge [scientifica], which the Lord acquired when a child, are here called "Pharaoh;" thus it is that knowledge itself which thus addresses the Lord, that is, it is Jehovah 
who does so by means of that knowledge. Hence it is evident that these things signify that the Lord bethought Himself. Mental advertence comes by means of memory-knowledge, thus by means of Pharaoh, 
by whom, as before said, this knowledge is signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1491</b></p><p><b>1491.</b>
That 'Pharaoh called Abram' means that the Lord recalled to mind becomes clear from the meaning of 'Pharaoh' as knowledge. The knowledge itself, that is, the facts which the Lord absorbed when a boy, 
are here called 'Pharaoh'. Thus it is knowledge itself which so addressed the Lord, that is, Jehovah did so by means of knowledge. From this it is evident that the words used here mean that the Lord 
recalled to mind. Awareness came through knowledge, thus through Pharaoh, who, as stated, means knowledge. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1491</b>
</p><b>1491.</b>
Quod 'vocavit Pharaoh Abramum' significet quod Dominus recordatus, constare potest a significatione 'Pharaonis' quod sit scientia; ipsa scientia seu ipsa scientifica quae Dominus hausit cum puer, hic 
appellantur 'Pharaoh,' ita est ipsa scientia quae ita alloquitur Dominum, seu Jehovah per scientiam; inde patet quod haec significent quod Dominus recordatus; animadvertentia venit per scientiam, ita 
per 'Pharaonem,' per quem significatur, ut dictum, scientia. </p>
