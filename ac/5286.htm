<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5286节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5286.</strong>“如今法老要看定”表属世层的展望。这从“看”或“观看”的含义清楚可知，“看”或“观看”是指展望；因为“看”在此含有行动的意思，即法老要采取的行动。不过，当“看”没有采取行动的意思时，它表示理解和觉知，如前所示（<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5114.htm">5114</a>节）。就属世层的展望而言，情况是这样：人的属世层，即他的属世心智，在他的理性层之下；它凭自己展望任何事，尽管它看似凭自己展望；但它的展望是从里面来的，因为内层在外层展望，就跟人在镜子里看自己，即照镜子差不多，他的形像仿佛在这镜子里。约瑟向法老这样说在内义上也体现了这一点；因为“约瑟”代表属灵层的属天层，也就是内层；而“法老”代表属世层，也就是外层；在法老看来，约瑟就是此处所说的那个有聪明有智慧的人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5286</b></p><p><b>5286.</b>
And now let Pharaoh see. That this signifies the looking forward of the natural, is evident from the signification of "seeing," or "looking," as being to look forward; for "seeing" here implies activity, 
namely, in doing; but when it does not imply that something is to be done, it signifies understanding and perceiving (as was shown above, n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5114). 
With the looking forward of the natural the case is this. Man's natural, or his natural mind, which is beneath his rational mind, does not of itself look forward to anything, although it appears 
to do this as of itself; but its looking forward is from within, for the inner looks forward in the outer very much as a man looks at himself in a mirror, in which the figure appears as if it were there. 
This is also presented in the internal sense by Joseph's speaking thus to Pharaoh; for by Joseph is represented the celestial of the spiritual, which is inner, and by Pharaoh the natural, which is 
outer; and Joseph seemed to Pharaoh to be that very man intelligent and wise who is here spoken of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5286</b></p><p><b>5286.</b>
'And now let Pharaoh see' means provision to be made by the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as making provision; for 'seeing' here implies an action, one that Pharaoh is to take. 
But when 'seeing' does not imply the taking of an action, it means understanding and discerning, as shown in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5114.htm">5114</a>. The situation so far as provision 
made by the natural is concerned is this: A person's natural - that is, his natural mind which is beneath his rational mind - cannot by itself see to any provision whatever that has to be made. It seems 
to do so by itself, but any provision it does make is seen to by what is interior. This sees within the exterior what provision needs to be made, almost as a person sees himself in a mirror in which 
his image seems to exist. This particular matter is presented in the internal sense by Joseph speaking in the way he does to Pharaoh - 'Joseph' representing the celestial of the spiritual, which is 
what is interior, and 'Pharaoh' the natural, which is what is exterior - and by its seeming to Pharaoh that Joseph was the very man with intelligence and wisdom, about whom Joseph was speaking. </p>

</p><b>5286.</b>
`Et nunc videat Pharaoh': quod significet prospectionem naturalis, constat a significatione `videre' quod sit prospicere, nam `videre' hic activum involvit, nempe ut faciat; cum autem videre non involvit 
faciendum, significat intelligere et appercipere, ut n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5114 ostensum est. Cum prospectione naturalis ita se habet: naturale hominis seu mens 
ejus naturalis quae infra mentem ejus rationalem est, non quicquam prospicit ex se, apparet tamen usque sicut a se sed prospectio ejus est ab interiore; hoc prospicit in exteriore, paene sicut homo semet 
in speculo in quo imago apparet tanquam ibi; hoc quoque sistitur {1}in sensu interno per id quod Josephus id loquatur ad Pharaonem, et per `Josephum' repraesentatur caeleste spiritualis quod est 
interius, et per `Pharaonem' naturale quod est exterius, et Josephus visus est {2}Pharaoni ille ipse vir intelligens et sapiens, {3}de quo.  @1 i hic$ @2 a Pharaone$ @3 A had de quo lo- but d; probably 
lo- would have become locutus if finished.$ </p>
