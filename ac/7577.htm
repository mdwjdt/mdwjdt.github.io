<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7577节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7577.</strong>“那时有冰雹；有火在冰雹中间窜动，甚是厉害”表坚定的虚假信仰与恶欲一起。这从“冰雹”、“火”和“在中间窜动”的含义清楚可知：“冰雹”是指由邪恶所生的虚假，如前所述（<a href="7574.htm">7574</a>节），在此是指坚定的虚假信仰，因为经上说“冰雹甚是厉害”；“火”是指恶欲，如刚才所述（<a href="7575.htm">7575</a>节）；“在中间窜动”是指一起。事实上，恶欲在核心，因为它是虚假的源头。<br />此处正在描述的，是那些属于教会，在来世侵扰正直人之人的状态，就是当他们在教会事物，也就是他们曾宣称相信的良善和真理方面经历荒凉时的状态。也就是说，那时，坚定的虚假信仰与恶欲一起在他们中间掌权；因为这就是他们的内在状态。这些虚假与恶欲是不可分割的，因为在生活上陷入邪恶的人在教义也会陷入虚假。在那些陷入生活的邪恶的人看来，情况似乎完全不是这样，因为当口头上宣称相信取自圣言或其教会教义的真理时，他们以为自己就拥有了对这些真理的信仰。甚至在他们看来，他们似乎真的有信仰；而事实上，如果他们的生活是邪恶的，他们就没有这种信仰，而是要么口头宣称相信与他们的真实想法不一致的东西，要么以为某事是真的，因为他们被先知并说明相信它是真的；他们持守这种信仰，是为了利益和重要职位。这意味着当他们不再为重要职位奋斗，或追求利益时，这信仰就会落空，那时他们就预备学习与恶欲一致的虚假。这些虚假从内在存在于那些生过着邪恶生活的人中间，无论他们多么以为它们不存在。<br />在来世，当一切外在事物被夺走，这类人只剩下自己的内层时，这一事实就会变得非常清楚了。这时，虚假就会爆发出来，无论他们在世上曾思想的虚假，还是他们未曾公开思想的虚假。事实上，这些虚假从已成为其生活一部分中的邪恶爆发出来，因为虚假无非是邪恶在进行推理，以支持自己，使自己合理化。由此可见这些人在来世是何状态，即坚定的虚假信仰和恶欲一起存在于在他们中间掌权的状态。</p>

And there was hail, and fire at the same time walking in the midst of the hail, very grievous. That this signifies the persuasions of falsity together with the cupidities of evil, is evident from the 
signification of "hail," as being falsity from evil (of which above, n. 7574), here the persuasion of falsity, because it is said "hail very grievous;" from the signification of "fire," as being the 
cupidity of evil (of which just above, n. 7575); from the signification of "walking in the midst," as being to be together, and indeed the cupidity of evil inmostly, because this was the source of the 
falsity. [2] There is here described the state of those who are of the church and infest the upright in the other life when they have been vastated as to what is of the church, that is, as to the goods 
and truths which they professed; namely, that then persuasions of falsity together with cupidities of evil reign with them; for such is their interior state. The persuasions of falsity and the cupidities 
of evil are inseparable, for he who is in evil as to life, is in falsity as to doctrine. It may indeed seem otherwise to those who are in evil of life; for when with the mouth they profess truths 
from the word, or from the doctrine of their church, they suppose that they are in the belief of these truths. It also appears to them as if they were; but still they are not if the life is evil; 
for they either profess with the mouth what disagrees with their thoughts, or they think that it is so from a persuasive faith, which is for the sake of gain or of honors; therefore when there is no further 
canvassing for honors, or chasing of gain, this faith falls to the ground, and then they readily learn falsities which agree with the evils of cupidities. These falsities exist inwardly with those 
who live evilly, no matter how much they believe that they do not exist. [3] That this is so, clearly shows itself in the other life, when the externals have there been taken away, and such persons 
have been left to their interiors. Then falsities burst forth, both those which they had thought in the world, and those which they had not openly thought; for they burst forth from the evils which 
had been of their life, because falsities are nothing else than evils reasoning and defending themselves. From all this it can be seen what is their state in the other life, namely that they have persuasions 
of falsity together with cupidities of evil. </p>

'And there was hail, and at the same time fire running down in the midst of the hail, extremely heavy' means firm beliefs in what is false together with desires for evil. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'hail' as falsity arising from evil, dealt with above in <a href="7574.htm">7574</a>, at this point firm belief in what is false since it says the hail was 'extremely heavy'; from the meaning of 'fire' as the desire for 
evil, dealt with just above in <a href="7575.htm">7575</a>; and from the meaning of 'running down in the midst' as being together. Indeed the desire for evil is at the centre, for the falsity emanates from it.  </p>

 What 
is being described here is the state of those belonging to the Church who molest the upright in the next life - their state when the things of the Church with them, that is, the forms of good and the 
truths which they have claimed to believe in, have been laid waste. That is to say, their state is now one in which firm but false beliefs together with evil desires reign; for this is what their state 
inwardly is like. Those false beliefs and evil desires are inseparable; for when evil takes hold in a person's life, falsity takes hold in his doctrine. When a person's life is taken hold of by evil, 
the situation may seem to him to be entirely different, for when people claim with their lips to believe in truths drawn from the Word or from the teachings of their Church they fancy that they have 
a belief in them. It even appears to them as though they do; but in fact they have no such belief if their life is evil. For either they claim with their lips to believe in things which are different 
from what they really think, or they think something is true because they have been told and persuaded to believe that it is, and this belief they hold on account of their desire for gain and important 
positions. This means that when they are no longer striving for important positions or seeking after gain that belief falls away, and then those people take hold of falsities that fit in with their 
evil desires. Falsities fitting in with evil desires are present inwardly with those who lead an evil life, no matter how much they may think that they are not. The truth of this is made thoroughly 
plain in the next life when everything external has been taken away and those kinds of people have been left to their inner selves. Falsities now erupt, both those which had played a part in their thinking 
in the world and those which had not evidently done so. For those falsities erupt from the evils which had been part of their life, falsities being nothing other than evils producing reasons to 
support and justify themselves. From all this one may see what the state of those people in the next life is like, namely a state in which firm beliefs in what is false together with desires for what 
is evil rule them.  </p>

`Et fuit grando, et ignis simul ambulans in medio grandinis, gravis valde': quod significet falsi persuasiones una cum mali cupiditatibus, constat ex significatione `grandinis' quod sit falsum ex {1}malo, 
de qua supra n. 7574, hic falsi persuasio, quia dicitur `grando gravis valde'; ex significatione `ignis' quod sit cupiditas mali, de qua mox supra n. 7575; et ex significatione `ambulare in medio' 
quod sit una esse, et quidem mali cupiditas {2}intime, quia ex illa falsum. 	2 (s)Describitur hic status illorum qui ab Ecclesia et infestant probos in altera vita, quando vastati sunt quoad illa 
quae Ecclesiae sunt, hoc est, quoad bona et vera quae professi, quod nempe tunc regnent apud illos persuasiones falsi una cum cupiditatibus mali; status enim interior illorum talis est; sunt persuasiones 
falsi et cupiditates mali inseparabiles, nam qui in malo est quoad vitam, is in falso est quoad doctrinam; {3}potest quidem ipsis qui in malo vitae sunt, aliter videri', nam quando ore profitentur 
vera ex Verbo, aut ex doctrinali Ecclesiae suae, putant quod in fide illorum sint; apparet etiam eis quasi essent, sed usque non sunt si vita {4} mala est, vel enim ore profitentur quae aliter cogitant, 
vel cogitant quod ita sit ex fide persuasiva, quae fides est propter lucrum, aut propter honores; quare cum non amplius est ambitus honoris, aut aucupatio lucri, fides illa cadit, et tunc falsa arripiunt 
quae cum malis cupiditatum concordant; falsa concordantia cum cupiditatibus mali sunt {5}interius apud illos qui male vivunt, utcumque credunt quod non sint; quod ita sit, se clare manifestat 
in altera vita, quando {6} ibi externa ablata sunt, et tales (m)relicti sunt interioribus suis, tunc erumpunt falsa, tam quae cogitaverant in mundo quam quae non manifeste cogitaverant; erumpunt enim 
illa ex malis, quae vitae illorum fuerant, nam falsa non aliud sunt quam mala ratiocinantia et {7}sibi patrocinantia; ex his constare potest qualis status illorum in altera vita est, {8} quod nempe sint
