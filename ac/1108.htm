<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1108.</strong>有些人被保持在半醒半睡的状态中，甚少思考，除非在他们清醒的时候（这种情形会交替发生），这时他们忆起在肉身生活时的所思所为，然后又回复到半醒半睡的状态。以此法，他们被消磨。他们在左脚下，稍微靠前一点。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1108.</strong> Some remain in a state midway between wakefulness and sleep, thinking little, except from time to time when they seem to waken and remember the things they had thought and done during bodily life. Then they fall back into a state midway between waking and sleeping. This is the way they are purged.<br />They are under the left foot, out in front a little. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1108</b></p><p><b>1108.</b>
Some are kept in a middle state between sleep and waking, and think very little, except when they as it were awake-which takes place by alternations-and then they remember what they had thought and done 
in the life of the body, and again they relapse into the middle state between being awake and being asleep. In this way these are vastated. They are under the left foot, a little in front. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1108</b></p><p><b>1108.</b>
Some are kept in a condition halfway between being awake and being asleep, and think very little. By turns so to speak they wake up and remember what they have thought and done during their lifetime, 
only to slip back again into the halfway condition between being awake and being asleep. In this way they are vastated. They are below the left foot, a little towards the front. </p>

</p><b>1108.</b>
Quidam in statu medio tenentur inter vigiliam et somnum, et perparum cogitant, modo per vices quasi expergiscuntur, et reminiscuntur eorum quae in vita corporis cogitarunt et fecerunt; et iterum in 
statum medium inter vigiliam et somnum relabuntur; et sic vastantur:  sunt sub pede sinistro paulo antrorsum. </p>
