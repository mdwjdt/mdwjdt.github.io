<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10460节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10460</strong>.“摩西便因怒气发热”表这个民族背离圣言、教会和敬拜的内在。这从“因怒气发热”的含义清楚可知，“因怒气发热”当论及主时，是指一个人背离内在事物，因而背离神性事物，如前所述（参看<a href="10431.htm">10431</a>节）。“因怒气发热”当论及摩西时所表相同，因为“摩西”代表圣言，或来自主的神性真理，或也可说神性真理方面的主（关于这种代表，可参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节提到的地方）。之所以说“背离圣言、教会和敬拜的内在”，是因为背离圣言内在的人也背离教会的内在，同样背离敬拜的内在；事实上，教会的内在和敬拜的内在都来自圣言的内在。因为圣言教导一个教会成员必须是什么样，或与人同在的教会必须是什么样，还教导与教会成员同在的敬拜必须是什么样。事实上，构成内在教会，以及内在敬拜的，正是爱与信之良善与真理；圣言教导这些良善与真理，而它们就是圣言的内在事物。</p>

And Moses waxed hot with anger. That this signifies the turning away of that nation from the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship, is evident from "to wax hot with anger," when said concerning 
the Lord, as being the turning away of man from things internal, thus from things Divine (of which above, see n. 10431). The like is signified by "waxing hot with anger" when predicated of Moses, 
because by Moses is represented the Word, or the Divine truth which is from the Lord; or what is the same, the Lord in respect to Divine truth (concerning which representation see the places cited 
in n. 9372).  It is said "from the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship," for he who turns himself away from the internal of the Word, also turns himself away from the internal of the 
church, and likewise from the internal of worship, because the internal of the church and the internal of worship are from the internal of the Word. For the Word teaches what must be the quality of 
the man of the church, or what must be the quality of the church with man, and likewise what must be the quality of worship with the man of the church; because it is the goods and truths of love and of 
faith that make the internal church, and also internal worship. The Word teaches these goods and truths, and these are the internal things of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10460</b></p><p><b>10460.</b>
'And Moses grew hot with anger' means that nation's turning away from the internal side of the Word, the Church, and worship. This is clear from the meaning of 'growing hot with anger', when it has reference 
to the Lord, as a person's turning away from internal and so Divine things, dealt with above in <a href="10431.htm">10431</a>. The like is meant by 'growing hot with anger' when this is attributed to Moses, because 
'Moses' represents the Word or Divine Truth which comes from the Lord, or what amounts to the same thing, the Lord in respect of Divine Truth, regarding which representation, see in the places referred 
to in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>. The expression 'from the internal side of the Word, the Church, and worship' is used because the person who turns away from what exists on the internal side of the Word turns away as well 
from what exists on the internal side of the Church and also on the internal side of worship, since what resides internally in the Church and internally in worship derives from that which resides internally 
within the Word. For the Word teaches what a member of the Church must be like or what the Church as it exists with a person must be like, and also what the worship with a member of the Church 
must be like. For the forms of good and the truths of love and faith are what compose the Church internally and also worship internally; they are what the Word teaches, and they are what compose the 
Word internally.  </p>

</p><b>10460.</b>
`Et exardescebat ira Moscheh': quod significet aversionem illius gentis ab interno Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, constat ex significatione `exardescere ira' cum de Domino, quod sit aversio hominis ab 
internis, ita a Divinis, de qua supra n. 10,431; simile per `exardescere ira' significatur cum praedicatur de Mosche, quia per `Moschen' repraesentatur Verbum seu Divinum Verum quod a Domino, seu quod 
idem, Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, de qua repraesentatione videatur in locis citatis n. 9372. Dicitur ab interno Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, nam qui avertit se ab interno Verbi, ille etiam se avertit 
ab interno Ecclesiae et quoque ab interno cultus, quoniam internum Ecclesiae, (c)ac internum cultus, sunt ex interno Verbi; docet enim Verbum qualis erit homo Ecclesiae, seu qualis erit Ecclesia apud 
hominem, et quoque qualis erit cultus apud hominem Ecclesiae; sunt enim bona et vera amoris et fidei, quae faciunt Ecclesiam internam, et quoque cultum internum; illa docet Verbum, ac illa sunt interna Verbi. </p>
