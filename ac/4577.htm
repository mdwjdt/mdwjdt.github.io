<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4577节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4577.</strong>“我也要把这地赐给你以后你的种”表归给（属世层）当作它自己的神性真理。这从“种”和“把这地赐给”的含义清楚可知：“种”是指信之真理（参看<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>节），在至高意义上是指神性真理（<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>节）；“把这地赐给”是指归给良善，如刚才所述（<a href="4576.htm">4576</a>节），因此“把这地赐给你的种”在至高意义上是指将神性良善归给神性真理。之所以归给神性真理，是因为主的人身在得荣耀之前，是神性真理，这就是为何主论到自己说，祂是“真理”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>），因而还自称为“女人的种”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.15.htm">3:15</a>）。但主的人身得荣耀后，就变成神性良善；这时，神性真理从作为神性良善的祂发出，并仍在发出。这神性真理就是主所要差的“真理的灵”，如约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.16.htm">14:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">15:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">15</a>；参看<w1>3704<w2>3704<w3>节）中所说。由此可见，“你以后你的种”在至高意义上表示归给祂当作祂自己的神性真理，以及神性真理从神性良善，也就是祂自己发出，并被归给那些处于良善，因而处于真理的人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4577</b></p><p><b>4577.</b>
And to thy seed after thee will I give the land. That this signifies Divine truth appropriated, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being the truth of faith (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940), 
and in the supreme sense the Divine truth (n. 3038); and from the signification of "giving the land," as being to appropriate good (of which just above, n. 4576); thus by "giving the land to thy seed," 
is signified in the supreme sense to appropriate Divine good to Divine truth. But that it is the Divine truth which is appropriated, is because before the Lord was glorified He was in respect to 
his Human the Divine truth, and hence the Lord says of Himself that He is "the Truth" (John 14:6), and hence also He is called the "seed of the woman" (Gen. 3:15). But after the Lord had been glorified 
in respect to His Human, He became the Divine good; and then from Him as the Divine good proceeded and proceeds the Divine truth, which is the "Spirit of truth" that the Lord was to send, as said in 
John 14:16, 17; 15:26, 27; 16:13-15: see n. 3704. From all this it is evident that by the words "to thy seed after thee" is signified in the supreme sense the Divine truth appropriated to Him; and also 
that the Divine truth proceeds from the Divine good which is Himself, and is appropriated to those who are in good and thence in truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4577</b></p><p><b>4577.</b>
'And to your seed after you I will give the land' means Divine Truth when made over [to the Natural] as its own. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>, but in the highest sense Divine Truth, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>; and from the meaning of 'giving the land' as making over good, dealt with immediately above in <a href="4576.htm">4576</a>; so that in the highest sense 'giving the 
land to your seed' means making Divine Good over to Divine Truth. But the reason why Divine Truth was made over is that before the Lord's Human was glorified it was Divine Truth, which is why the Lord 
speaks of Himself in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6</a> as 'the Truth', and in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3:1</a> 'He is called 'the seed of the woman'. But after the Lord's Human was glorified it was made Divine Good. At this point it was from Him 
as Divine Good that Divine Truth went forth, and goes forth still. Such Divine Truth is the Spirit of Truth whom the Lord will send, referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:16,%2017;%2015:26,%2027;%2016:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:16, 17; 15:26, 27; 16:13-15</a>; see <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. From 
this it may be seen that 'to your seed after you' in the highest sense means Divine Truth when made over to Him as His own, and also that Divine Truth goes forth from Divine Good which He is and is 
made over as their own to those in whom good and its partner truth are present. </p>

`Et semini tuo post te dabo terram': quod significet Divinum Verum appropriatum, constat a significatione `seminis' quod sit verum fidei, de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610, (x)1940 {1}; in supremo autem 
sensu Divinum Verum, n. 3038; et a significatione `dare terram' quod sit appropriare bonum, de qua mox supra n. 4576; </p>
<p>ita per `semini tuo dare terram in sensu supremo significatur Divino Vero appropriare 
Divinum Bonum: quod autem sit Divinum Verum appropriatum, est quia Dominus quoad Humanum suum antequam glorificatus, fuit Divinum Verum {2}, inde Dominus de Se dicit quod sit Veritas,' Joh. 
xiv 6, et inde quoque vocatur `semen mulieris', Gen. iii 15, sed postquam Dominus quoad Humanum Suum glorificatus est, factus {3} est Divinum Bonum, et tunc ab Ipso ut a Divino Bono processit est 
procedit Divinum Verum, quod est spiritus veritatis quem Dominus missurus, de quo apud Johannem xiv 16, 17; xv 26, 27; </p>
<p>xvi 13-15, videatur n. 3704; inde constare potest quod per `semini tuo post te
