<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第968节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>968.</strong>一些精灵从世上带来这样的观念：他们不能与魔鬼说话，而要逃避。但他们被告知，对主所保护的人来说，这根本没有任何伤害，哪怕他们被整个地狱包围，无论从内还是从外。我已通过大量奇妙的经历得知这一点，因此最终即使面对最坏的地狱团伙，我也一点不害怕，亦不妨碍我与他们对话。我被赐予这样的经历，是为了让我了解他们的秉性。我被允许对惊讶于我曾与他们说话的人说，这不仅不会对我造成任何伤害，而且来生的魔鬼也曾是人，在世时他们在仇恨、报复、奸淫中度过一生，那时，其中一些人甚至备受尊敬。事实上，他们当中有些人活在肉身时，我就认识他们。我还被允许说，魔鬼无非就是这样的地狱一员。况且，人在肉身生活期间，至少有两个来自地狱的精灵与其同在，也至少有两位来自天堂的天使与其同在。这些地狱精灵在恶人当中施行统治，但在善人当中则被征服，并被迫服侍。因此，若以为自创世之初就有魔鬼，而非他们曾经是人，这是错误的。听到这一切，他们全都目瞪口呆，并承认他们原先对魔鬼及其团伙持有完全不同的看法。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]968.</strong> Some people have taken with them from the world the idea that we must not talk to devils but avoid them.{*1} But I have taught them that talking to a devil is not the least bit dangerous for people whom the Lord protects, even if the whole of hell were to besiege them within and without. This I was able to recognize from such long and miraculous experience that in the end I had no fear. I was not even afraid of talking with the worst members of hell's crew — an experience granted to me for the sake of learning what they were like.<br />To those who have wondered at my conversations with devils I have been allowed to add this: Not only does it do me no harm, but devils in the other life were once people. They are the ones who led lives of hatred, revenge, and adultery when they lived in the world. Some of them were even more highly respected than other people at the time. In fact I counted some of them as acquaintances of mine during their physical life. All that "the Devil" means is a mob of such people in hell.{*2} While we are living in the body, we have with us at least two spirits from hell, in addition to two angels from heaven. In bad people, the spirits from hell are in charge, but in good people they are subdued and forced to be useful.<br />So it is a mistake to believe that any devil has existed from the beginning of creation other than those who once were people of this type.<br />When the people listening to me hear these things, they are dumbfounded and confess that they had held a completely different opinion of the Devil and the Devil's crew.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the dangers of interacting with devils and evil spirits, compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_968/bible_king-james-version_1-timothy_4_1" target=_top>1 Timothy 4:1</a>: "Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons" (New Revised Standard Version).

Certain spirits had brought with them from the world the idea that they must not speak with the devil, but flee from him. But they were instructed that it would do no harm at all to those whom the Lord 
protects, even if they should be encompassed by all hell, both within and without. This it has been given me to know by much and by marvelous experience, so that at length I came to have no fear of 
even the worst of the infernal crew, to hinder my speaking with them; and this was granted in order that I might become acquainted with their character. To those who have wondered that I spoke with them, 
I have been permitted to say not only that this would do me no harm, but also that the devils in the other life are such as have been men, and who when they lived in the world passed their life in 
hatred, revenge, and adultery, some of them being then preeminently esteemed; nay, that among them are some I had known in the bodily life; and that the devil means nothing else than such a crew of 
hell. And furthermore, that men, while they live in the body, have with them at least two spirits from hell, as well as two angels from heaven; and that these infernal spirits rule with the evil, but 
with the good have been subjugated and are compelled to serve. Thus it is false to suppose that there has been a devil from the beginning of creation, other than such as were once men. When they heard 
these things they were amazed, and confessed that they had held a totally different opinion in regard to the devil and the diabolical crew. </p>

Some have brought with them from the world the idea that they must not talk to the devil but flee from him. They have been informed however that nothing at all could harm people whom the Lord is protecting, 
not even if the whole of hell were surrounding them, both from without and from within. This I have been given to know from many amazing experiences. Such were those experiences that in the end 
I had no fear at all, not even of the worst of the hellish crew, to deter me from talking to them. I have also been granted such experiences so that I might get to know what the members of that crew 
are like. To people who have marvelled that I have spoken to them I have been allowed to say further that not only would this do me no harm but also that devils in the next life have previously been 
men who went through life in the world hating, getting revenge, and committing adultery. I have said that some of them at the time were highly respected people, and indeed that some of them are people 
whom I had known during their lifetime. I have also been allowed to say that 'devil' means nothing else than such a crew in hell, and in addition that people while living in the world have present with 
them at least two spirits from hell, as well as two angels from heaven, and that these hellish spirits though ruling among the wicked have among the good been overpowered and made subservient. Thus 
it is wrong to think of some devil existing since the beginning of creation other than those who have previously been men. When people have heard all this they have been dumbfounded and have confessed 
that they have held an altogether different opinion concerning the devil and his crew. </p>

</p><b>968.</b>
Quidam e mundo secum traxerunt illam ideam quod cum diabolo non loquendum, sed quod fugiendus; sed instructi sunt quod ne hilum noceat eis quos Dominus tutatur, si vel circumfunderentur toto inferno 
tam extus quam intus, quod a multa et prodigiosa experientia mihi datum nosse, sic ut demum nihil timerem ne quidem pessimos e turba infernali, quin cum illis loquerer; quod etiam concessum, ut scirem 
quales essent. Illis qui mirati sunt quod loquerer cum iis, porro dicere datum, quod non solum hoc mihi nihil noceat, sed etiam quod ii diaboli sint in altera vita qui homines fuerunt, et qui cum vixerunt 
in mundo, in odiis, vindictis et adulteriis vitam transegerunt, et quidam tunc prae aliis aestimati; immo quod quidam inter eos sint quos cognovi in vita corporis; quodque diabolus nihil aliud 
significet quam talem inferni turbam: et praeterea quod homines, dum vivunt in corpore, apud se habeant ad minimum binos spiritus ab inferno, praeter quod etiam binos angelos e caelo qui spiritus infernales 
apud malos regnant, sed apud bonos subjugati sunt et servire coguntur: ita quod falsum sit, quod putent aliquem diabolum ab initio creationis fuisse, alium quam qui homines fuerunt tales.  Cum 
haec audiverunt, stupefacti sunt, et fassi quod prorsus aliam opinionem de diabolo et turba diabolica habuerint.
