<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9139节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9139.</strong>“人若使田地或葡萄园荒凉”表通过恶欲对教会良善和真理的剥夺。这从“荒凉”、“田地”和“葡萄园”的含义清楚可知：“荒凉”是指通过恶欲剥夺（参看<a href="9141.htm">9141</a>节）；“田地”是指良善方面的教会（<a href="2791.htm">2791</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>，<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>节），因而是指教会的良善；“葡萄园”是指真理方面的教会，因而是指教会的真理。“田地”之所以指良善方面的教会，是因为田间产物，如小麦和大麦，表示教会的内在和外在良善（<a href="3941.htm">3941</a>，<a href="7602.htm">7602</a>，<a href="7605.htm">7605</a>节）；“葡萄园”之所以指真理方面的教会，是因为“葡萄酒”作为葡萄园里的产物，表示良善之真理（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>，<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>节）。<br />“田地”和“葡萄园”所具有的这些含义来源于灵界的代表。因为当高层天堂的天使谈论一群处于良善的人时，满了小麦和大麦的田地就出现在灵人面前；当天使谈论一群处于良善之真理的人时，满了葡萄的葡萄园，连同酒榨一起出现。这些代表不是由于这类田地和葡萄园在地上的存在，而是由于对应；因为小麦和大麦，或由它们制成的饼滋养肉体，就像爱和仁的良善滋养灵魂一样；而酒作为喝的东西滋养肉体，就像信之真理和良善滋养灵魂一样。正因如此，在圣言中，爱之良善和信之真理被称为“食物和喝的”，或饮食；在本节经文，它们也是天上的饮食（参看<a href="56.htm">56</a>-<a href="58.htm">58</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="681.htm">681</a>，<a href="1973.htm">1973</a>，<a href="1974.htm">1974</a>，<a href="4459.htm">4459</a>，<a href="4792.htm">4792</a>，<a href="5147.htm">5147</a>，<a href="5293.htm">5293</a>，<a href="5576.htm">5576</a>，<a href="5579.htm">5579</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>，<a href="8562.htm">8562</a>节）。<br />“葡萄园”表示信之良善和真理方面的教会，该教会被称为属灵教会，这一点从圣言中提到“葡萄园”的地方清楚看出来，如耶利米书：<br />许多牧人毁坏我的葡萄园，践踏了我的田地，使我喜爱的田地变为荒凉的旷野；他们使它（葡萄园）荒凉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.10.htm">12:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处“葡萄园”和“田地”明显表示教会；教会凭信和仁的真理和良善而为教会，故显而易见，在这几节经文中，“葡萄园”是指真理方面的教会，“田地”是指良善方面的教会。以赛亚书：<br />耶和华必审判祂民中的长老和首领；你们放火烧了葡萄园。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />此处“葡萄园”也明显表示信之良善和真理方面的教会；因为“耶和华必审判的长老”是指教会的良善（参看<a href="6524.htm">6524</a>，<a href="6525.htm">6525</a>节），“首领”是指教会的真理（<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />我要为我所亲爱的唱歌，是我朋友的歌，论祂的葡萄园：我所亲爱的有葡萄园在油之子的角中。他围上它，栽种上等的葡萄树。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.2.htm">2</a>）<br />这论及主，主就是那“所亲爱的”和“朋友”；“葡萄园”是指祂的属灵教会；“上等的葡萄树”是指该教会的信之良善；“油之子的角”（ a horn of a son of oil）是指从爱之良善中长出来的该教会的信之良善。对圣言内义一无所知的人绝无可能知道“在油之子的角中的葡萄园”表示什么。然而，这些话里面隐藏着无法用语言来表达的秘密。这些话充分描述了主的属灵国度与祂的属天国度的结合；也就是第二层天堂与第三层天堂的结合；因而充分描述了属于属灵国度的对主之信的良善和属于属天国度的对主之爱的良善的结合。“葡萄园”是指属灵国度；“在角中”是指在能力中，因而在这个国度中；“油之子”是指属天国度中爱之良善的外在层面。属天国度，也就是主的至内在天堂被称为“橄榄树”或“橄榄园”，因为“油”表示属天之爱的良善（<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）。要知道，主在地上的国是教会。有两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度，属灵国度构成第二层天堂，属天国度构成第三层天堂（参看<a href="3887.htm">3887</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="4279.htm">4279</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）；它们结合在一起（参看<a href="6435.htm">6435</a>节）。<br /><br />当那日，有纯葡萄酒的葡萄园，你们要回应它说：我耶和华是看守葡萄园的，我必时刻浇灌它。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.2.htm">27:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“纯葡萄酒的葡萄园”表示属灵教会。阿摩司书：<br />在各葡萄园，必有哀号；我要从你中间经过。渴望耶和华日子来到的，你们有祸了！耶和华的日子对你们是什么呢？那是黑暗没有光明的日子。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.17.htm">5:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这论及教会的末期，这时信之良善和真理不复存在；这段时期就是“耶和华的日子，那是黑暗没有光明的日子”。这就是为何经上说“在各葡萄园必有哀号”。启示录：<br />那天使就把镰刀扔在地上，收取了地上的葡萄树，丢在神烈怒的大酒榨中。<br />“收取了地上的葡萄树”表示吞灭教会的真理和良善；“地”在此是指教会。由此可见为何主经常将天国比作“葡萄园”（如在马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.1.htm">20:1</a>ff；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.28.htm">21:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.33.htm">33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.41.htm">41</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.12.htm">12</a>）；又为何在约翰福音中，主自称“葡萄树”：<br />枝子若不住在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子；你们若不住在我里面，也是这样。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。离了我，你们就不能做什么。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“葡萄树”是指对主的信，因此是指信方面的主；事实上，主就是信，因为信源于祂；除了源于祂的信之外，任何信都不是信。也正因如此，“葡萄树”表示对祂的信，或说系对主之信的信。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9139</b></p><p><b>9139.</b>
When a man shall desolate a field, or a vineyard. That this signifies the deprivation of the good and the truth of the church through cupidities, is evident from the signification of "to desolate," as 
being to deprive through cupidities (see n. 9141); from the signification of "a field," as being the church as to good (n. 2791, 3766, 4982, 7502), thus the good of the church; and from the signification 
of "a vineyard," as being the church as to truth, thus the truth of the church. That "a field" denotes the church as to good, is because the things of a field, such as wheat and barley, signify 
internal and external goods of the church (n. 3941, 7602, 7605); and that "a vineyard" denotes the church as to truth, is because "wine," which belongs to a vineyard, signifies the truth of good (n. 1071, 
6377). [2] That "field" and "vineyard" have this signification has its origin from the representatives in the spiritual world. For fields full of wheat and barley appear before spirits when the 
angels in a heaven above them are conversing about an assemblage of those who are in good; and there appear vineyards full of grapes, with winepresses, when the angels are conversing about an assemblage 
of those who are in the truth of good. These representatives are not from the fact that there are such things upon earth; but from the correspondences, in that wheat and barley, or the bread made therefrom, 
nourish the body, as the good of love and of charity nourishes the soul; and in that wine, as drink, acts in like manner. From this it is that in the Word the goods of love and the truths of 
faith are called "meats and drinks;" in this sense also they are heavenly meats and drinks (see n. 56-58, 680, 681, 1973, 1974, 4459, 4792, 5147, 5293, 5576, 5579, 5915, 8562). [3] That a "vineyard" 
denotes the church as to the good and the truth of faith, which church is called the spiritual church, is evident from the passages in the Word where a "vineyard" is mentioned; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     
Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trodden under foot My field, they have made My field of desire into a desert of solitude; he has made it [the vineyard] into a solitude (Jer. 12:10-11); </p>
<p>where 
"vineyard" and "field" manifestly denote the church; and as the church is the church from the truth and good of faith and of charity, it is clear that the "vineyard" here denotes the church 
as to truth, and the "field," the church as to good. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah cometh into judgment with the elders of His people, and the princes thereof; ye have set on fire the vineyard (Isa. 3:14); </p>
<p>here 
also "the vineyard" plainly denotes the church in respect to the good and truth of faith; for "the elders with whom Jehovah will come into judgment," denote the goods of the church (see n. 6524, 
6525); and "the princes," its truths (n. 5044). [4] Again: </p>
<p>     I will sing to my beloved a song of my friend touching His vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard in a horn of the son of oil; and he 
enclosed it, and planted it with a noble vine (Isa. 5:1-2); </p>
<p>this is said of the Lord, who is the "beloved" and the "friend;" the "vineyard" denotes His spiritual church; a "noble vine" denotes the 
good of faith of this church; and a "horn of the son of oil," the good of the faith of that church from the good of love. He who knows nothing of the internal sense of the Word, cannot possibly know what 
is signified by "a vineyard in a horn of the son of oil." Yet in these words there lies hidden a secret that cannot be expressed in words. By these words is fully described the conjunction of the 
Lord's spiritual kingdom with His celestial kingdom; that is, the conjunction of the second heaven with the third; consequently the conjunction of the good of faith in the Lord, which is of the spiritual 
kingdom, with the good of love to the Lord, which is of the celestial kingdom. The "vineyard" denotes the spiritual kingdom; "in a horn" denotes in power, thus in this kingdom; and "the son of oil" 
denotes the external good of love of the celestial kingdom. The celestial kingdom, which is the inmost heaven of the Lord, is called an "olive-tree" or an "olive-yard," because "oil" denotes the good 
of celestial love (n. 886, 4582, 4638). Be it known that the kingdom of the Lord on earth is the church. (That there are two kingdoms, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom, and that the spiritual 
kingdom constitutes the second heaven, and the celestial kingdom the third heaven, see n. 3887, 4138, 4279, 4286; of the conjunction of these, see n. 6435.) [5] Again: </p>
<p>     In that day a vineyard 
of pure wine, answer ye to it; I Jehovah do keep it; I will water it every moment (Isa. 27:2-3); </p>
<p>where "a vineyard of pure wine" [merum] denotes the spiritual church. In Amos: </p>
<p>     In all vineyards 
shall be wailing; I will pass through thee. Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! What to you is the day of Jehovah? It is of darkness and not of light (Amos 5:17-18); </p>
<p>this is said of the 
last time of the church, when there is no longer any good and truth of faith, which time is "the day of Jehovah, a day of darkness and not of light;" whence it is said, "in all vineyards shall be wailing." 
In John in Revelation: </p>
<p>     The angel put forth His sickle into the earth, and vintaged the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great Winepress of the wrath of God (Rev. 14:19); </p>
<p>"to vintage 
the vine of the earth" denotes to consume the truth and good of the church; "the earth" here being the church. From all this it can be seen why the Lord so often likened the kingdom of the heavens 
to a "vineyard" (as in Matt. 20:1, and the following verses; 21:28, 29, 33-41; Mark 12:1-12); and why the Lord called Himself "the vine," in John: </p>
<p>     As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except 
it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. Without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:4-6); </p>
<p>"the vine" denotes faith in the Lord, consequently 
the Lord as to faith; for the Lord is faith, because faith is from Him; for no faith is faith save that which is from Him. Hence also "the vine" denotes the faith which is directed to Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9139</b></p><p><b>9139.</b>
'When a man devastates a field or a vineyard' means a stripping away of the Church's goodness and truth by evil desires. This is clear from the meaning of 'devastating' as a stripping away by evil desires, 
dealt with below in <a href="9141.htm">9141</a>; from the meaning of 'a field' as the Church in respect of good, dealt with in <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, <a href="7502.htm">7502</a>, thus the Church's good; and from the meaning of 'a vineyard' as the 
Church in respect of truth, thus the Church's truth. The reason why 'a field' is the Church in respect of good is that the products of a field, such as wheat and barley, mean forms of good in the Church, 
internal and external ones, <a href="3941.htm">3941</a>, <a href="7602.htm">7602</a>, <a href="7605.htm">7605</a>; and the reason why 'a vineyard' is the Church in respect of truth is that 'wine', which is the product of a vineyard, means the truth of good, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>, <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The origin of these meanings of 'a field' and 'a vineyard' lies in representatives in the spiritual world. For fields full of wheat and barley appear before the eyes of spirits when angels 
in a higher heaven are talking about an assembly of people governed by good; and vineyards full of grapes appear, together with winepresses in them, when angels are talking about an assembly of people 
governed by the truth of good. Those representatives are not due to the existence of such fields and vineyards on earth; rather, they are due to correspondences, in that wheat and barley, or bread 
made from them, nourish the body just as the good of love and charity nourishes the soul, and in that wine serving as drink nourishes the body just as the truth and good of faith nourish the soul. 
This is the reason why in the Word the good of love and the truth of faith are called food and drink; indeed in this sense they are heavenly food and drink, <a href="56.htm">56</a>-<a href="58.htm">58</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="681.htm">681</a>, <a href="1973.htm">1973</a>, <a href="1974.htm">1974</a>, <a href="4459.htm">4459</a>, <a href="4792.htm">4792</a>, <a href="5147.htm">5147</a>, 
<a href="5293.htm">5293</a>, <a href="5576.htm">5576</a>, <a href="5579.htm">5579</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>, <a href="8562.htm">8562</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'a vineyard' means the Church in respect of the good and truth of faith, which is called a spiritual Church, is clear from places in the Word in 
which a vineyard is mentioned, as in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trampled down My field; they have rendered the field of [My] delight into a lonely wilderness. 
They have made it (the vineyard) into a solitary place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2012:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 12:10, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'vineyard' and 'field' plainly stand for the Church; and since the Church is the Church by virtue of the truth and good 
of faith and charity, it is evident that in these verses 'vineyard' is the Church in respect of truth and 'the field' the Church in respect of good. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah enters into judgement with 
the elders of His people and with its princes. You set alight the vineyard. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%203:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 3:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'vineyard' plainly stands for the Church in respect of the good and truth of faith; for 'the elders' 
with whom Jehovah will enter into judgement are the Church's forms of good, <a href="6524.htm">6524</a>, <a href="6525.htm">6525</a>, and 'the princes' are its truths, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will sing to my beloved a song of my 
friend regarding His vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard in a horn of a son of oil,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> which he surrounded [with an enclosure], and planted with the choicest vine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:1, 2</a>
</blockquote>
ff.  </p>
<p>This refers to the 
Lord, who is the 'beloved' and 'friend'. 'The vineyard' is His spiritual Church, 'the choicest vine' is that Church's good of faith, and 'a horn of a son of oil' is that Church's good of faith growing 
out of the good of love. The person who knows nothing whatever about the internal sense of the Word cannot possibly know what 'a vineyard in a horn of a son of oil' means. Nevertheless this expression 
has a meaning lying hidden within it such as no words can express. They contain a full description of the Lord's spiritual kingdom linked to His celestial kingdom, that is, of the second heaven to 
the third, consequently a full description of the good of faith in the Lord, which is the spiritual kingdom's, linked to the good of love to the Lord, which is the celestial kingdom's. 'The vineyard' 
is the spiritual kingdom; 'in a horn' is in power, thus in that kingdom, 'a son of oil' being the external level of the good of love in the celestial kingdom. The celestial kingdom, which is the Lord's 
inmost heaven, is called the olive or an olive-grove, for 'oil' means the good of celestial love, <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>. It should be recognized that the Lord's kingdom on earth is the Church. As regards 
the existence of two kingdoms, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom, and the fact that the spiritual kingdom constitutes the second heaven and the celestial kingdom the third, see <a href="3887.htm">3887</a>, <a href="4138.htm">4138</a>, 
<a href="4279.htm">4279</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>; and with regard to their being linked together, <a href="6435.htm">6435</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that day, a vineyard of unmixed wine;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> respond to it. I Jehovah am guarding it; every moment 
I will water it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2027:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 27:2, 3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'A vineyard of unmixed wine' stands for the spiritual Church. In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
In all vineyards there will be wailing; I will pass through you. Woe to you desiring the day 
of Jehovah! What will the day of Jehovah be for you? It will be one of darkness, and not of light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:17, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the final period of the Church, when the good and truth of faith 
do not exist any longer, that final period being meant by 'the day of Jehovah, which will be one of darkness, and not of light'. This is why it says, 'In all vineyards there will be wailing'. In John, 
in Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
The angel sent his sickle into the earth and harvested the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:18, 19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Harvesting the vine of 
the earth' means devouring the Church's truth and good, 'the earth' being the Church. From all this one may now see why it is that the Lord likened the kingdom of heaven so many times to a vineyard, 
as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2020:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 20:1</a>ff; 21:28, <a href="29.htm">29</a>, <a href="33.htm">33</a>-<a href="41.htm">41</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:1-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:1-13</a>; and why it is that the Lord called Himself 'the vine' in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither 
can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches; apart from Me you cannot do anything. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:1</a>
</blockquote>
ff.  </p>
<p>'The vine' is faith in the Lord, and for that reason is the Lord in respect 
of faith. For the Lord is faith because faith originates in Him; no faith is faith except that which originates in Him. So it is also that 'the vine' means faith that is faith in Him.

n. (x)9141, ex significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia quoad bonum, qua n. (x)2971, 3766, 4982, 7502, ita bonum Ecclesiae, et ex significatione `vineae' quod sit Ecclesia quoad verum, ita verum Ecclesiae; 
quod `ager' sit Ecclesia quoad bonum, est quia illa quae agri sunt, ut triticum et hordeum, significant bona Ecclesiae interna et externa', n. 3941, 7602, 7605, et quod `vinea' sit Ecclesia quoad 
verum, est quia `vinum,' quod vineae est, significat verum boni, n. 1071, 6377. 	[2] Quod ager et vinea id significent, ducit originem ex repraesentativis in mundo spirituali, nam coram spiritibus 
apparent agri tritico et hordeo pleni, cum angelis qui in superiore caelo sunt, sermo est de coetu qui in bono; et apparent vineae plenae uvis, cum torcularibus ibi {4}, cum angelis (t)sermo est de coetu 
qui in vero {5} boni (o)est; repraesentativa illa non sunt ex eo quod talia sint in terris sed ex correspondentiis, quod triticum et hordeum, seu inde panis, nutriant corpus sicut bonum amoris et 
charitatis nutrit animam, et quod vinum similiter ut potus, sicut verum et bonum fidei animam; inde est quod bona amoris et vera fidei in Verbo dicantur cibi ac potus, sunt etiam in eo sensu cibi et potus 
caelestes {6}, n. 56-58, 680, 681, 1973, 1974, 4459, 4792, 5147, 5293, 5576, 5579, 5915, 8562. 	[3] Quod `vinea' sit Ecclesia quoad bonum et verum fidei, quae Ecclesia spiritualis vocatur {7}, constat 
ex locis in Verbo ubi nominatur, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Pastores multi perdiderunt vineam Meam, conculcarunt agrum, Meum; redegerunt agrum desiderii [Mei] in desertum solitudinis; posuit illam (vineam) 
in solitudinem, (x)xii 10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi `vinea' et `ager' manifeste pro Ecclesia; et quia Ecclesia est Ecclesia ex vero et bono fidei et charitatis, patet quod `vinea' ibi sit Ecclesia quoad verum, 
et `ager' quoad bonum: apud Esaiam, 	Jehovah in judicium venit cum senioribus populi Sui et principibus ejus; vos succenditis vineam, iii 14; </p>
<p>hic {8} quoque `vinea' manifeste pro Ecclesia quoad bonum 
et verum {9} fidei, seniores {10} enim cum quibus Jehovah in judicium veniet sunt bona Ecclesiae, n. (x)6524, 6525, et `principes' sunt vera ejus, n. 5044: [4] apud eundem, 	Cantabo dilecto Meo canticum 
amici Mei de vinea ejus; vinea fuit dilecto Meo in cornu filii olei, quam circumdedit, et plantavit vite nobili, V 1, 2, seq.; </p>
<p>hic de Domino, Qui est `dilectus' et `amicus,' `vinea' est Ecclesia 
`spiritualis' Ipsius, `vitis nobilis' est bonum fidei illius Ecclesiae, `cornu filii olei' est bonum fidei illius Ecclesiae ex bono amoris; qui non scit aliquid de sensu interno Verbi, nequaquam scire 
potest quid significat vinea in cornu filii olei'; in illis verbis usque tale arcanum latet quod exprimi vocibus non potest; describitur per illa plene conjunctio regni spiritualis Domini cum regno 
caelesti Ipsius, hoc est, (o)conjunctio secundi caeli cum tertio, consequenter conjunctio boni fidei in Dominum, quod est regni spiritualis, cum bono amoris in Dominum, quod est regni caelestis; `vinea' 
est regnum spirituale, `in cornu' est in potentia, ita in illo, `filius olei' est bonum amoris externum regni caelestis {11}; regnum caeleste, quod est caelum intimum Domini, vocatur (x)`olea' (d)seu 
olivetum, quia {12} `oleum' est bonum amoris caelestis, n. 886, 4582, (x)4638; sciatur quod regnum Domini in terris sit Ecclesia.  Quod bina regna sint, regnum caeleste et regnum spirituale {13}, 
et quod regnum spirituale constituat secundum caelum, et regnum caeleste tertium, videatur n. 3887, 4138, 4279, 4286; de conjunctione illorum, n. 6435: [5] apud eundem, 	In die illo, vinea meri, respondete 
illi; Ego Jehovah custodiens illam, in momentis irrigabo illam, xxvii 2, 3; </p>
<p>`vinea meri' pro Ecclesia {14} spirituali: apud Amos, 	In omnibus vineis planctus, transibo per te; vae desiderantibus 
diem Jehovae! quid vobis dies Jehovae? ille tenebrarum et non lucis, v 17, 18; </p>
<p>ibi de ultimo tempore Ecclesiae, quando non amplius bonum ac verum fidei, quod (o)tempus est `dies Jehovae, (o)qui tenebrarum 
et non lucis; inde dicitur, `in omnibus vineis planctus': apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, 	Misit angelus falcem suam in terram, et vindemiavit vitem terrae, et conjecit in torcular irae Dei (x)magnum, 
xiv 18, 19; </p>
<p>`vindemiare vitem terrae' est consumere verum et bonum {15} Ecclesiae; `terra' hic est Ecclesia.  Ex his {16} constare potest unde est quod Dominus toties assimilaverit regnum caelorum 
vineae, ut apud Matthaeum xx 1 seq., xxi 28, 29, 33-41; Marc. xii 1-13, et unde (o)est quod (o)Dominus Se vocaverit vitem,' apud Johannem {17}, 	Quemadmodum palmes non potest fructum ferre a seipso 
ni manserit in vite, ita neque vos, nisi in Me manseritis; Ego sum vitis, vos palmites; sine Me non potestis facere quicquam, {18} xv 1 seq.; </p>
<p>`vitis' est fides in Dominum, proinde {19} est Dominus 
quoad fidem, nam Dominus est fides quia fides est ab Ipso, fides enim {20} non est fides nisi quae ab Ipso, inde etiam est quod `vitis' sit fides {21} quae in Ipsum. @1 Ps. ii 12; Es. ix 57, 18 written
