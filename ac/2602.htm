<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2602节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2602.</strong>有一个民族（我听说，这个民族来自印度群岛），其宗教信仰在于用以下仪式敬拜最伟大的神：他们崇拜这个神时，首先放大自己，然后匍伏在地，像蛆一样。他们还持有这样的观念：他们认为在这个旋转的宇宙之上有一个最伟大的神在俯视他们所做的事。由于他们曾有这样的宗教仪式，所以在来世，这些仪式被带回到他们那里。在他们想象这类事时，我曾与他们交谈过。他们绝大部分谦逊、温顺、心思简单。天使逐步使他们摆脱这种幻想，根据他们的宗教信仰教导他们说，这个最伟大的神就是主；诚然，他们为了崇拜祂能放大自己，其实却像小虫子，因为主从高处看待每一个事物。就这样，他们通过自己的宗教信仰被带入对良善与真理的认知中。</p>

There is one nation (I was told that it is from the Indies) which makes it their religion to worship the Greatest God with the following rite. When they are adoring Him they first magnify themselves, 
but soon prostrate themselves as worms; and at the same time they hold, that above the universe, which they believe to be whirling around, is that Greatest God, looking down on what they are doing. As 
they have had such religious observances, in the other life they are brought back into them; and I have spoken with them while they imagined such things. They are for the most part modest, obedient, 
and simple in heart. They are by successive steps freed by the angels from this phantasy; for they are instructed, in accordance with their religion, that the Greatest God is the Lord; and that they 
can indeed magnify themselves on account of their being able to adore Him; and that nevertheless they are like little worms; and that the Lord from on high sees each and all things. In this manner, by 
means of their own religion, they are brought into the knowledges of good and truth. </p>

There is one nation - which, I have been told, comes from the Indies<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - whose religion consists in their worshipping the Greatest God with the following ritual: When they adore Him they first of all 
magnify themselves, and then they prostrate themselves as maggots. It also consists in an idea that above the universe which they believe to be spinning round, there is that Greatest God looking down 
on what they are doing. Such having been their religious ideas and practices they are brought back to them in the next life. I have spoken to these people when such imaginings were in their minds. They 
are for the most part unassuming, obedient, and simple at heart. They are freed in stages by the angels from these false notions, for they are taught, in keeping with their religion, that the Greatest 
God is the Lord and that their ability to magnify themselves results from their being able to adore Him, and that indeed for all that they are as maggots, and that the Lord from on high sees every 
single thing. In this way, by means of their own form of religion, they are led as is fitting for them into cognitions of good and truth.

Una gens est, dictum quod ex Indiis, cui hoc religiosum, quod colant Maximum Deum eo ritu, ut cum adorant illum, primum se magnifaciant, sed mox sicut vermiculos substernant; tum quod super universum, 
quod credunt circumgyrari, sit Maximus ille Deus, spectans inde quid faciant: quia religiosa illis talia fuerant, in altera vita reducuntur in illa; cum quibus cum talia sibi imaginati, locutus: sunt 
quoad plurimam partem modesti, oboedientes, ac simplices corde.  Illi successive ab illa phantasia per angelos liberantur; instruuntur enim secundum religiosum suum quod Maximus Deus sit Dominus, et 
quod se magnifacere queant ex eo quod possint Ipsum adorare, et quod usque instar vermiculorum sint, et {1} quod Dominus e supremo videat omnia et singula: ita per religiosum suum convenienter in cognitiones 
boni et veri perducuntur. 	@1 i ac ita quod sint nihili respective.$ </p>
