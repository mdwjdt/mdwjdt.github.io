<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1603.</strong>“罗得离别亚伯兰以后”表外在人的欲望已被除去，以至于不再妨碍。这从“罗得”代表外在人，以及关于他的分离，即那些造成妨碍之物分离清楚可知。当这些事物被除去后，内在人，或耶和华就会与外在人，即主的人性本质行如一体。就象前面说的，不一致的是外在事物，正是它们阻碍内在人通过使外在人与其合而为一进入外在人作工。外在人无非是一种工具或器官，本身没有任何生命可言；它从内在人接受生命，然后表面上看似外在人凭自己拥有生命。<br />但对主来说，祂逐出遗传之恶，因此净化其人性本质的器官成分后，这些事物也接受生命，以致就内在人而言原本是生命的主也能在外在人方面变成生命。这就是约翰福音中“荣耀”的含义：<br />耶稣就说，如今人子得了荣耀，神在人子身上也得了荣耀。神既然在人子身上得了荣耀，也要因自己荣耀人子，并且要快快地荣耀祂。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />父啊，时候到了，愿你荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你。父啊，现在让我在你自己面前得着荣耀，就是未有世界以先，我同你所有的荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，父啊，愿你荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>）</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1603.</strong> After Lot separated from him means when the cravings of his outer self had been set aside so as not to get in the way. This is established by the representation of Lot as his outer self and by the previous statement that Lot separated himself 钬?that is, impediments separated themselves. When they had been put aside, his inner self (Jehovah) became unified with his outer self (the Lord's human quality). Outward traits are the only incompatible elements, the elements described as blocking the inner self from integrating with the outer self when acting on it [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547" target=_top>1547</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1563:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1568" target=_top>1568</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1581" target=_top>1581</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1594" target=_top>1594</a>]. The outer self is only a kind of tool or organ, in itself devoid of life, that receives life from the inner self. When it does, it appears as if it contains inherent life.<br />[2] In the Lord, however, even the organic parts of his human nature received life, after he had purified them by ridding himself of the evil he had inherited. Just as the Lord's inner being was life itself, then, his outer being too became life itself. This is what his attainment of glory{*1} means in John:<br />Jesus says, "Now the Son of Humankind has gained glory, and God has gained glory in him. If God has gained glory in him, God will also make him glorious in his own self, and will make him glorious immediately." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/bible_king-james-version_john_13_31-32" target=_top>John 13:31-32</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Father, the hour has come; give glory to your Son, so that your Son may also give glory to you. Now therefore make me glorious 钬?you, Father, in your own self 钬?with the glory that I had in you before the world existed.

This is the first usage of the term glorificatio in Swedenborg's published theological works. In addition to its more ordinary meanings of praising and ascribing glory to, Swedenborg commonly uses this term in a more theological meaning to denote a key concept in his Christology. This latter meaning is based especially on various usages of the parallel Greek term 未慰尉维味蔚喂谓 (dox谩zein; "to glorify," "to have a high opinion of") in the Gospel of John, some of which are quoted just below in the text. In this meaning, Swedenborg interprets "glorifying" and "glorification" as a lifelong process in which Jesus' human nature was rendered divine, or united with the divine, so that by the time he "ascended to the Father" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/bible_king-james-version_john_20_17" target=_top>John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/bible_king-james-version_acts-of-the-apostles_1_9-11" target=_top>Acts 1:9-11</a>) after his resurrection, his human nature was fully divine, and fully one with the divine nature represented by the Father. For more on this concept and the process it involves, see notes 6 and 7 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1401" target=_top>1401</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a> in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1603/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1446" target=_top>1446</a>.

After that Lot was separated from him. That this signifies when the cupidities of the external man had been removed so as not to impede, is evident from the representation of Lot, which is the external 
man, and from what precedes in regard to his being separated, that is, the things that would impede; and when these had been removed, the internal man, or Jehovah, acted as one with the external, or 
with the Lord's Human Essence. The external things that do not agree, spoken of above, are what impede the internal man, while acting into the external, from making it a one with itself. The external 
man is nothing else than a kind of instrument, or something organic, having in itself no life; it receives life from the internal man, and then it appears as if the external man had life from itself. [2] 
But with the Lord, after He had expelled the hereditary evil, and so had purified the organic things of His Human Essence, these too received life, so that the Lord, being already life in regard 
to His internal man, became life as to His external man also. This is what is signified by "glorification," in John: </p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. 
If God is glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him (John 13:31-32). 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>     Again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify 
Thee. Now therefore O Father glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was (John 17:1, 5). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Jesus said, Father, glorify Thy name. There 
came therefore a voice from heaven, I have both glorified, and will glorify it again (John 12:28).

'After Lot had been separated from him' means when the desires of the External Man had been removed so that they did not obstruct. This is clear from the representation of 'Lot' as the External Man, 
and from what has been said already about his being separated, that is, those things that would cause obstruction When these had been removed the Internal Man, or Jehovah, acted as one with the External 
Man, or the Lord's Human Essence. It is the external things that disagree - these alone - which have been spoken of already,. that obstruct and so prevent the internal man, when operating into the 
external, from making it one with itself. The external man is no more . than a kind of implement or organ, and does not in itself possess any life at all From the internal man however it can receive life, 
and then it seems as though the external man does possess life from itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With the Lord however after He had cast out hereditary evil and so purified the organic elements of the Human Essence, 
these too received life so that the Lord, who was already Life as regards the internal Man, became Life as regards the External Man as well. This is what 'glorification' means in John, </p>

'Postquam separatus Lot ab illo': quod significet cum cupiditates Externi Hominis remotae essent ut non impedirent, constat a repraesentatione 'Loti' quod sit Externus Homo, aque illis quare praecedunt, 
quod 'separatus,' hoc est, illa quae impedirent; quae cum remota fuerunt, Internus Homo seu Jehovah unum agebat cum Externo seu cum Humana Domini Essentia; sunt modo externa non concordantia, de 
quibus dictum, quae impediunt quin internus homo, dum agit in externum, faciat ut unum sit; externus homo nihil aliud est quam instrumentale quoddam, aut organicum, in se nullam vitam habens; ex interno 
homine accipit vitam, et tunc apparet sicut externus homo vitam haberet ex se: [2] apud Dominum autem postquam expulit malam hereditarium, et sic purificavit Humanae Essentiae organica, etiam haec 
vitam acceperunt, ita ut Dominus, sicut quoad Internum Hominem fuit Vita, etiam quoad Externum Hominem factus Vita; hoc est quod significat glorificatio, apud Johannem, 	Dicit Jesus, Nunc glorificatus 
est Filius Hominis, et Deus glorificatus in Ipso; si Deus glorificatus est in Ipso, etiam Deus glorificabit Ipsum in Se Ipso, et statim glorificabit Ipsum, xiii 31, 32: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Pater, venit 
hora; glorifica Filium Tuum, ut etiam Filius Tuus glorificet Te:... nunc ergo glorifica Me Tu Pater, apud Te Ipsum, gloria quam habui, antequam mundus 	esset, apud Te, xvii 1, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Jesus 
dixit, Pater glorifica Tuum Nomen; exiit igitur vox e caelo, Et glorificavi, et rursus glorificabo, xii 28. </p>
