<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1894节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1894.</strong>前面已阐述和说明（<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>节等），“撒莱”是指与良善联结的真理，“亚伯兰”是指主的内在人，就是耶和华。主的内在人，就是耶和华被称为人，是因为唯独耶和华是人。从真正意义上说，人（Man）表示存在，人通过这存在而得其存在。存在本身（人通过这存在而得其存在）就是神性，因而是属天之物和属灵之物。若没有神性的属天和属灵之物，人里面就没有真正的人性之物，只有一种诸如野兽所具有的动物本性。每个人都是凭耶和华或主的存在而成为人，也凭此而被称作人。构成这个人的属天之物就在于他的对主之爱和对邻之爱。否则，他不过是野兽。<br />耶和华或主是唯一的人，人类凭祂而被称作人，一个人也是凭祂而比别人更是人。这从前文（<a href="49.htm">49</a>，<a href="288.htm">288</a>，<a href="477.htm">477</a>，<a href="565.htm">565</a>节），以及以下事实可以看出来：耶和华或主在上古教会的族长、以及后来的亚伯拉罕和众先知面前显为人。也正因如此，当地上再没有人，或人类当中再没有任何属天和属灵之物时，主便通过象其他人一样出生而屈尊披上人性，并使这人性变成神性。在这方面，祂也是唯一的人。此外，整个天堂在主面前呈现为一个人的形像，因为它展现了祂自己。天堂由此，尤其通过以下事实而被称作大人，即在天堂，主是全部中的全部。</p>

That Sarai is truth adjoined to good, has been said and shown before (n. 1468 and elsewhere), as also that Abram is the Lord's internal man, which is Jehovah. The Lord's internal man, which is Jehovah, 
is called Man, because no one is man except Jehovah alone; for man, in the genuine sense, signifies that Esse from which man is. The Esse itself from which man is, is the Divine, consequently the celestial 
and the spiritual. Without the Divine celestial and spiritual, there is nothing human in man, but only a sort of animal nature, such as there is in beasts. It is from the Esse of Jehovah, or 
of the Lord, that every man is man; and from this also he is called man. The celestial which makes the man is that he loves the Lord and loves the neighbor; in this way is he man, because he is an image 
of the Lord, and because he has this from the Lord; otherwise he is a wild beast.  [2] That Jehovah or the Lord is the only Man, and that men have it from Him that they are called men, also that one 
is more man than another, may be seen above (n. 49, 288, 477, 565); and the same may also be seen from the fact that Jehovah, or the Lord, appeared as Man to the fathers of the Most Ancient Church, 
and afterwards also to Abraham and to the prophets; and on this account also the Lord, after there was no man any longer on the earth, or no longer anything celestial and spiritual among men, deigned 
to assume the human nature by being born as are other men, and to make that nature Divine; and in this way also He is the only Man. Besides, the universal heaven presents before the Lord the image of 
a man, because it presents Himself. From this, heaven is called the Grand Man, and this especially from the fact that the Lord there is all in all. </p>

That 'Sarai' is truth allied to good has been stated and shown already in <a href="1468.htm">1468</a> and elsewhere; and that 'Abram' is the Lord's Internal Man, which is Jehovah, has likewise been stated and shown. The reason 
why the Lord's Internal Man, which is Jehovah, is called Man is that nobody is Man except Jehovah alone, for in its genuine sense Man means that Being (Esse) from which man derives his being. Being 
(Esse) itself - from which man derives his being - is Divine, and is consequently celestial and spiritual. Without that Divine celestial and spiritual there is nothing truly human in man, only something 
animal-like such as exists in beasts. It is by virtue of Jehovah's or the Lord's Being (Esse) that every man is 'man', and by virtue also of His Being that he is called 'man'. The celestial which 
makes him man consists in his love of the Lord and his love of the neighbour; and so he is man because he is an image of the Lord and because he has that celestial character from the Lord. Otherwise 
he is a wild beast. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards Jehovah or the Lord being the only Man and that it is by virtue of Him that men are called 'men', also that one is more so man than another, see <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="288.htm">288</a>, <a href="477.htm">477</a>, <a href="565.htm">565</a>. 
This matter becomes additionally clear from the fact that Jehovah or the Lord manifested Himself as Man to the patriarchs of the Most Ancient Church, subsequently to Abraham as well, and also to the 
prophets. This too was why the Lord was pleased, when no man remained on earth any more, that is, when nothing celestial or spiritual was left to mankind any more, to take on human nature by being born 
as any other, and to make that human nature Divine. In this respect also He is the only Man. In addition to this the whole of heaven presents before the Lord the image of a human being, because it 
is a presentation of Himself, and as a consequence heaven is called the Grand Man, chiefly from the fact that in heaven the Lord is the All in all. </p>

Quod `Sarai' sit verum adjunctum bono, dictum et ostensum (o)est prius n. 1468 et alibi; pariter quod `Abram' sit Internus Homo Domini qui Jehovah.  Quod Internus Homo Domini qui Jehovah, dicatur Homo, 
causa est quod nemo sit Homo quam solus Jehovah, nam Homo significat in suo genuino sensu illud Esse ex quo homo; ipsum Esse ex quo homo, est Divinum, proinde caeleste et spirituale; absque Divino 
caelesti et spirituali nihil est humanum apud hominem, sed est animale quoddam quale apud bestias: ex Jehovae seu Domini Esse habet omnis homo quod sit homo, inde etiam appellatur homo; (m)caeleste quod 
hominem facit, est ut amet Dominum et amet proximum, sic est homo quia imago Domini, et quia illud habet a Domino; [2] alioquin est fera(n): quod Jehovah seu Dominus sit solus Homo et quod ab Ipso 
habeant homines quod dicantur homines, tum quod `unus sit magis homo quam alter, videatur n. 49, 288, 477, 565; et praeterea constare potest ex eo quod Jehovah seu Dominus apparuerit Antiquissimae Ecclesiae 
patribus ut Homo, postea etiam `Abrahamo Ut et prophetis; quare etiam dignatus est Dominus, postquam nullus amplius homo in terra seu nihil caeleste et spirituale amplius apud hominem, assumere 
naturam humanam per id quod natus sicut alius homo, et illam facere Divinam, sic etiam solus Homo: praeterea universum caelum refert coram Domino imaginem hominis, quia Ipsum, inde caelum `Maximus Homo' 
appellatur, (m)ex eo imprimis, quia Dominus ibi est omne in omnibus.(n) 	@1 i inde.$ 	@2 Abramo.$ </p>
