Verses 3-5. Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah is His name. Pharaoh's chariots and his army He hath cast into the sea; and the choice of the tertian captains are sunk in the sea Suph. The abysses have 
covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone. "Jehovah is a man of war," signifies that the Lord protects against all evils and falsities that are from the hells; "Jehovah is His name," signifies 
that it is He alone from whom all things are; "Pharaoh's chariots and his army He hath cast into the sea," signifies that the falsities from evil, in particular and in general, of those who were 
of the church and in a life of evil there, at His presence cast themselves into the hells; "and the choice of the tertian captains," signifies all with each; "are sunk in the sea Suph," signifies 
that they have shut themselves up in falsities from evil; "the abysses have covered them," signifies that falsities from cupidities have enveloped them; "they went down into the depths like a stone," 
signifies that they fell down toward lower things as if by reason of weight. </p>

<p>'Jehovah is a man of war' means that the Lord provides protection against all evils and falsities, which come from the hells. 'Jehovah 
is His name' means that He alone is the Source of all things. 'Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea' means the particular and the general falsities arising from evil of those 
belonging to the Church who led a life of evil in it, and the fact that at His presence those falsities have cast themselves into the hells. 'And his choice tertiary commanders' means all aspects together 
with specific details. 'Have been drowned in the Sea Suph' means that they have shut themselves up in falsities arising from evil. 'The depths have covered them' means that falsities resulting from 
evil desires have overwhelmed them. 'They went down into deep places like a stone' means that they sank down to lower levels as if on account of heaviness.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> lit. the choice of tertiary commanders. 
A tertiary commander was possibly an officer ranking third after Pharaoh, or possibly one in charge of a chariot in which there was also a driver and a warrior. </p>

Vers. 3-5.  Jehovah vir belli, Jehovah nomen Ipsius.  Currus Pharaonis et exercitum illius projecit in mare; et electio ducum tertianorum submersi in mari Suph.  Abyssi obtexerunt illos, descenderunt 
in profunditates sicut lapis.  `Jehovah vir belli' significat quod Dominus contra omnia mala et falsa, quae ab infernis, tutetur {1}: `Jehovah nomen Ipsius' significat quod solus sit a Quo omnia: `currus 
Pharaonis et exercitum illius projecit in mare' significat falsa ex malo in specie et in genere illorum qui ab Ecclesia et ibi in vita mali, quod se ad praesentiam Ipsius conjecerint in inferna: 
`et electio ducum tertianorum' significat omnia cum singulis: `submersi in mari Suph' significat quod concluserint se falsis ex malo: `abyssi obtexerunt illos' significat quod falsitates ex cupiditatibus 
operuerint illos: `descenderunt in profunditates sicut lapis' significat quod ad inferiora lapsi sint sicut ex gravi. 	@1 A has marginal note bella Jehovae, historica ***$ </p>
