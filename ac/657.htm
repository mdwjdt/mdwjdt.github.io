<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>657.</strong>“上、中、下三层”表知识、理性和觉性，这一点也可从前面所述推知。人的觉知部分有三个层级：最低层构成知识，中层构成理性意识，最高层构成觉性意识。这三者截然不同，彼此分离，以至于它们永不可混淆。然而，人未意识到这一点。原因在于，他的生活只专注于感官经验和知识。只要他坚持这种态度，他甚至不知道自己的理性意识不同于知识，更不用说他的觉性意识与知识的区别了。然而，情况如下：主通过觉性层流入理性层，通过理性层流入属记忆的知识。视听的感官生命由此而来。这是真实的流注，也是灵魂与身体的真实互动。若主的生命未流入人的觉知之物（确切地说，流入意愿之物，并由此流入觉知之物），然后经由觉知之物流入理性之物，再经由理性之物流入属记忆的知识，人不可能有生命。哪怕人处在假与恶中，主的生命仍流经意愿之物和觉知之物。但流入之物在理性部分照着觉知所取的形式被接受。正是这个流注使一个人变得理性，能反思和理解何为真理与良善。不过，关于这些问题，以及动物的生命是何情形，蒙主慈悲，以后再予以讨论。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]657.</strong> The symbolism of the lowest, second-level, and third-level [compartments] as matters of fact, reason, and understanding also follows.<br />There are three levels to the contents of the human intellect.{*1} The lowest has to do with factual knowledge, the middle with reason, and the highest with understanding. These levels are so clearly distinguished from each other that they never blur, but people are unaware of the distinction because they place life exclusively in what they can sense and learn about. Since they fixate on that level, they cannot see even that their ability to reason is different from their knowledge, still less that their ability to understand is different from it. The reality is that the Lord exerts an influence on our rational thinking through the things we truly understand, and on the data in our memory through our rational thinking, giving life to the senses of sight and hearing. This is true influx; this is the true connection between the soul and the body.{*2} Life could never exist in us if it did not flow from the Lord into the things we truly understand, and through these into the contents of our rational mind, and through these into the facts stored in our memory. Or to be more accurate, it first has to flow into the contents of our will and through these into the things we understand, and so on.<br />Even though we are enmeshed in falsity and evil, the Lord's life still enters in through the things we will and understand; but our rational mind absorbs those influences according to its form. This makes it possible for us to reason about, to reflect on, and to understand what is true and good. But more on these subjects below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6053" target=_top>6053-6058</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6189" target=_top>6189-6215</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6307" target=_top>6307-6327</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6466" target=_top>6466-6496</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6598" target=_top>6598-6626</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy; and also something on the way life operates in animals [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1902" target=_top>1902:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3646" target=_top>3646</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4776#subsection-2-4" target=_top>4776:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5850" target=_top>5850</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6323" target=_top>6323</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the intellect, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} The Latin term used here is influxus. In Swedenborg's usage, it can mean "influx," "inflow," or "spiritual influence." In the present translation the rendering "influx" is reserved for instances in which Swedenborg uses the word in the narrow, technical sense common in philosophical disputes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, disputes specifically about how the soul acts on the body (see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_657/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196" target=_top>196</a>). The point Swedenborg is making here is that the true explanation of what the philosophers call "influx" in their convoluted theorizing is simply the Lord's influence as just described.

That by the "lowest, second, and third stories" are signified things of knowledge, of reason, and of understanding [scientifica, rationalia, et intellectualia] follows also from what has been shown. 
There are three degrees of things intellectual in man; the lowest is that of knowledge [scientificum]; the middle is the rational; the highest, the intellectual. These are so distinct from each other 
that they should never be confounded. But man is not aware of this, for the reason that he makes life consist in what is of sense and knowledge only; and while he cleaves to this, he cannot even know 
that his rational part is distinct from that which is concerned with knowing [scientificum]; and still less that his intellectual part is so. And yet the truth is that the Lord flows through man's intellectual 
into his rational, and through his rational into the knowledge of the memory, whence comes the life of the senses of sight and of hearing. This is the true influx, and this is the true interaction 
of the soul with the body.  Without influx of the Lord's life into the things of the understanding in man-or rather into things of the will and through these into those of understanding-and through 
things of understanding into things rational, and through things rational into his knowledges which are of the memory, life would be impossible to man. And even though a man is in falsities and 
evils, yet there is an influx of the Lord's life through the things of the will and of the understanding; but the things that flow in are received in the rational part according to its form; and this 
influx gives man the ability to reason, to reflect, and to understand what truth and good are. But concerning these things, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter; and also how the case is with the life 
that pertains to brutes. </p>

The lowest, second, and third storeys' means factual knowledge, rational concepts, and intellectual concepts. In man there are three degrees in the understanding part; the lowest of these constitutes 
his factual knowledge, the middle his rational awareness, and the highest his intellectual awareness. These three are so distinct and separate from one another that they ought never to be confused. Man 
however is not directly conscious of this distinction, the reason being that he focuses life solely on sensory experience and factual knowledge. And as long as he clings to this attitude he is not 
even capable of recognizing that his rational awareness, still less his intellectual, is anything different from factual knowledge. Yet the situation is as follows: The Lord flows by way of man's intellectual 
degree into his rational, and by way of the rational into factual knowledge belonging to the memory. And from there comes the life of the senses - of seeing and hearing. This is the true influx 
and the true interaction of the soul and the body. Without the influx of the Lord's life into man's intellectual concepts - or rather into the desires of the will, and by way of these desires of the 
will into intellectual concepts, and by way of intellectual concepts into rational concepts, and by way of rational concepts into his factual knowledge which belongs to the memory - no life can possibly 
exist with man. And even when a person is under the influence of falsities and of evils there is still this influx of the Lord's life by the way of the desires of the will and intellectual concepts. 
But the things that flow in are received in the rational part according to the form the understanding takes. It is this influx also that enables a person to be rational, to reflect, and to understand 
what truth and good are. These matters however will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on, as also will life as it exists with animals. </p>

Quod per 'infimas, secundanas et tertianas' significentur scientifica, rationalia et intellectualia, inde quoque sequitur: sunt tres gradus intellectualium in homine; ejus infimum est scientificum, 
medium est rationale, supremum est intellectuale; haec ita distincta sunt inter se ut nusquam confundantur; sed quod homo hoc nesciat, causa est quod in sensuali et scientifico solum vitam ponat; et cum 
ei inhaeret, ne quidem scire potest quod rationale ejus sit a scientifico distinctum, minus tunc quod intellectuale; cum tamen ita se res habet quod Dominus per intellectuale apud hominem influat in 
ejus rationale, et per rationale in scientificum memoriae, inde vita sensuum, visus et auditus; hic est verus influxus, et hoc est verum commercium animae cum corpore; absque influxu vitae Domini in 
intellectualia apud hominem (seu potius in voluntaria, et per voluntaria in intellectualia, et per intellectualia in rationalia, et per rationalia in ejus scientifica quae sunt memoriae) {1} nusquam 
dari potest vita apud hominem: et tametsi homo in falsis est et malis, usque tamen est influxus vitae Domini per voluntaria et intellectualia, sed recipiuntur illa quae influunt, in parte rationali secundum 
ejus formam; et facit ut homo possit ratiocinari, possit reflectere, possit intelligere quid verum et bonum; sed de his, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; tum quomodo se habet vita 
apud bruta. 	@1 Parentheses inserted by Ed.$ </p>
