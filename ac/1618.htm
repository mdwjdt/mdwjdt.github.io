<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1618节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1618.</strong>“在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛”表出于该状态的敬拜。这从“坛”的含义清楚可知，前面（<a href="921.htm">921</a>节）解释过，“祭坛”一般指一切敬拜的代表物。敬拜的内义是指藉着爱与仁的一切结合。人若居于爱与仁，就不断居于敬拜中，外在敬拜只不过是它的外在表现。这就是天使的敬拜，因此，对他们而言，安息日永远不会结束。这反过来解释了为何“安息日”的内义是指主的国。但是，人只要尚在人世，就应参与外在敬拜；因为内在事物通过外在敬拜被激发出来，外在事物也通过外在敬拜被保持在圣洁中，以便内在事物能够流入。此外，人就是这样被赋予认知，预备接受属天之物，以及拥有被赐给他的圣洁状态，尽管他没有意识到这一点。这些圣洁的状态被主保存起来，以备他的永生之用。因为在来世，其生命的一切状态都会重现。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1618.</strong> The symbolism of and there he built an altar to Jehovah as worship in that phase is established by the symbolism of an altar as that which represents all worship in general, discussed earlier at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1618/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921" target=_top>921</a>.<br />In an inner sense, worship means all union achieved through love and charity. We worship constantly when we have love and charity; outward worship is merely an effect. Angels worship in this way, so they have a perpetual Sabbath. As a result, the Sabbath at a deeper level also symbolizes the Lord's kingdom.<br />While we are in the world, however, we really ought to worship outwardly as well. External worship stirs deeper dimensions, and it maintains the holiness of our external acts so that deeper elements can influence us. What is more, we absorb knowledge during worship and undergo preparation for accepting heavenly qualities. We also receive unconsciously the gift of holy states that the Lord preserves for our use in eternal life. Every state of our life returns in the other world. </p>

And there he built an altar to Jehovah. That this signifies worship from that state, is evident from the signification of "an altar," as being a representative of all worship in general (explained before, 
n. 921). By worship, in the internal sense, is meant all conjunction through love and charity. When a man is in love and charity he is continually in worship, external worship being merely the effect. 
The angels are in such worship; with them, therefore, there is a perpetual Sabbath; and from this the Sabbath, in the internal sense, signifies the Lord's kingdom. But man, while in the world, 
ought not to be otherwise than in external worship also; for by external worship internal things are excited, and by means of external worship external things are kept in holiness, so that internal things 
can flow in. And besides, man is thus imbued with knowledges, and is prepared for receiving celestial things, and is also gifted with states of holiness, although he is unaware of this; which states 
of holiness are preserved to him by the Lord for the use of eternal life, for in the other life all the states of his life return. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1618</b></p><p><b>1618.</b>
'And there he built an altar to Jehovah' means worship as the outcome of that state. This is clear from the meaning of 'an altar' as the representative of all worship in general, dealt with already in <a href="921.htm">921</a>. Worship in the internal sense means all conjunction by means of love and charity. A person is worshipping all the time if love and charity abide in him, external worship being only the outward 
expression of it. Such is the worship of angels, and therefore with them the sabbath never comes to an end; and this in turn explains why in the internal sense 'the sabbath' means the Lord's kingdom. 
While a person is in the world however he ought certainly to participate in external worship as well; for it is by external worship that internal things are aroused, and by means of external worship external 
things are kept holy so as to enable internal to flow in. Furthermore a person is endowed with cognitions by this means, and is made ready to receive celestial things, and also has states of holiness 
conferred on him, though he is not conscious of this. These states of holiness are preserved by the Lord for his use in eternal life; in fact all the states of his life reappear in the next life. </p>

</p><b>1618.</b>
'Et aedificabat ibi altare Jehovae': quod significet cultum ex illo statu, constat a significatione 'altaris' quod sit repraesentativum omnis cultus in genere, de qua prius n. 921.  Per cultum in sensu 
interno intelligitur omnis conjunctio per amorem et charitatem; homo in cultu est continue cum est in amore et charitate; cultus externus est solum effectus; angeli in tali cultu sunt, quare apud 
illos est perpetuum sabbatum, inde quoque sabbatum in sensu interno significat regnum Domini: sed homo cum in mundo est, non debet aliter quam esse quoque in cultu externo, ab externo enim cultu excitantur 
interna, et per externum cultum tenentur externa in sanctitate ut influere possint interna; praeter quod imbuatur homo sic cognitionibus, et praeparetur ad recipienda caelestia, ut et donetur statibus 
sanctitatis, quod ipse nescit, qui status sanctitatis a Domino ei conservantur in usum vitae aeternae; omnes enim ejus vitae status redeunt in altera vita. </p>
