<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7645节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7645.</strong>“人不能看到地”表随之而来的整个属世心智的黑暗。这从“不能看到”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：“不能看到”是指一种黑暗，也就是对真理没有觉知；“埃及地”是指属世心智，如前所述（<a href="7644.htm">7644</a>节）。必须简要解释为何当属世层最外面的事物荒凉时，整个属世心智会因此变暗。人心智的内层向下直达它的最低和最外层，并建立在该层基础之上，它的一切连续部分都一起住在那里。当最低层除了虚假和邪恶之外什么也没有时，从内层流入这些最低层的真理和良善就会流入那里的邪恶和虚假，进而在那里变成邪恶和虚假。因此，除了虚假和邪恶之外，没有什么东西显明在整个属世层中。这就是“不能看到地”所表示的整个属世心智的黑暗所描述的。也正因如此，当地狱灵经历荒凉时，他们就被限制在属世层的最外面部分。他们所拥有的劣质之光，也就是所谓的理解力之光，与这个世界的劣质之光没什么两样；在来世，这光在天堂的优质之光面前完全变成幽暗。由于属世层的最外面部分，也就是所谓的感官层，充满幻觉和由此而来的虚假，以及自我放纵和由此而来的邪恶（参看<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>，<a href="6845.htm">6845</a>节），还由于地狱就被这种劣质之光光照，所以当一个人正在重生时，主会赋予他从感官层被提升向更内层的能力（<a href="6183.htm">6183</a>，<a href="6313.htm">6313</a>，<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>节）。</p>

That one shall not be able to see the land. That this signifies the consequent darkening of the whole natural mind, is evident from the signification of "not being able to see," as being a darkening, 
that is, no perception of truth; and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (as above, n. 7644). How the case herein is, that from the vastation of the extremes or outermost 
things in the natural the whole natural mind is darkened, shall be briefly told. The interiors in man terminate in his ultimates, that is, in his outermost things, and there the successive things 
in him are together. When there is nothing but falsity and evil in the ultimates, then the truths and goods which flow in from the interiors into the ultimates, flow there into evils and falsities, 
and consequently are there turned into such things, and for this reason there appears nothing but what is false and evil in the whole natural. This is meant by the darkening of the whole natural mind 
which is signified by "not being able to see the land." From this also it is that when infernal spirits have been devastated they are in the outermost things of the natural; nor is their light, which 
is called intellectual light, unlike that of this world, which in the other life becomes thick darkness in the presence of the light of heaven. As the outermost of the natural, which is called the 
sensuous, is replete with fallacies and the falsities thence derived, and with pleasures and the evils thence derived (see n. 6844, 6845), and as the hells are in this light, therefore when a man is being 
regenerated he is endowed by the Lord with the capacity of being elevated from this sensuous toward more interior things (n. 6183, 6313, 7442). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7645</b></p><p><b>7645.</b>
'And one will not be able to see the land' means a darkening of the whole natural mind as a result. This is clear from the meaning of 'not being able to see as a darkening, that is, the failure to perceive 
truth; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the natural mind, as above in <a href="7644.htm">7644</a>. But a brief statement must be made to explain why, when the outermost contents of the natural are laid 
waste, the whole natural mind is darkened as a result. The interior parts of a person's mind reach down into and are based on its lowest and outermost levels, where all its consecutive parts reside together. 
When there is nothing on the lowest levels but falsity and evil, truths and forms of good flowing from the interior parts into those lowest levels are flowing into evils and falsities there, as 
a consequence of which they are themselves turned into evils and falsities there. Therefore nothing but falsity and evil is apparent in the whole of the natural. This is what a darkening of the whole 
natural mind as a result, meant by 'not being able to see the land', describes. Here also is the reason why, when they have undergone vastation, hellish spirits are limited to the outermost parts of 
the natural. The inferior light they have, which is called the light of understanding, is not unlike the inferior light of this world, which in the next life becomes utterly thick darkness at the presence 
of the superior light of heaven. Since the outermost part of the natural, called the level of the senses, is filled with illusions and resulting falsities, and with self-indulgence and resulting 
evils, <a href="6844.htm">6844</a>, <a href="6845.htm">6845</a>, and since the hells are lit by that inferior light, the Lord provides a person when he is being regenerated with the ability to be raised above that level of the senses to more internal 
levels, see <a href="6187.htm">6187</a>, <a href="6317.htm">6317</a>, <a href="7442.htm">7442</a>. </p>

</p><b>7645.</b>
`Et non poterit videre terram': quod significet obscurationem totius mentis naturalis inde, constat ex significatione `non posse videre' quod sit obscuratio, hoc est, nulla perceptio veri; et ex significatione 
`terrae Aegypti' quod sit mens naturalis, ut supra n. 7644.  Quomodo hoc se habet, quod ex vastatione extremorum in naturali obscuretur tota mens naturalis, paucis dicendum: interiora apud 
hominem terminantur in ultimis seu extremis ejus, et ibi quae successiva sunt apud illum simul sunt; quando in ultimis non est nisi quam falsum et malum, tunc vera et bona quae ab interioribus influunt 
in ultima, ibi influunt in mala et falsa, et {1}inde ibi vertuntur in talia; {2}ideo non apparet nisi quam falsum et malum in toto naturali; hoc intelligitur per obscurationem totius mentis naturalis 
inde, quae significatur per `non posse videre terram.'  Inde quoque est quod spiritus infernales cum devastati sunt, in extremis naturalis sint; lumen (c)illorum, quod lumen intellectuale vocatur, 
nec est absimile lumini hujus mundi, quod in altera vita prorsus fit caligo ad praesentiam lucis caeli.  Quia extremum naturalis, quod sensuale vocatur, est fallaciis et inde falsis, (c)ac voluptatibus 
et inde malis repletum, n. 6844, 6845, et quia inferna in illo lumine sunt, idcirco, {3}quando regeneratur homo, a Domino donatur facultate, ut a sensuali illo elevari possit versus interiora, videatur 
n. (m)6183, 6313,(n) 7442. 	@1 quoque$ 	@2 inde$ 	@3 cum homo, quando regeneratur$ </p>
