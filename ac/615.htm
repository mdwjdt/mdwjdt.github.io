<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第615节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>615.</strong>此处大致描述了该教会成员的性质；不是说他就是下文所探讨的那种样式，而是有可能变成那个样式，也就是说，他能通过信的知识被赋予仁，从而出于仁行事，并通过仁之善知道何为真。由于这个原因，仁之善或“公义”在先，仁之真或“完全”在后。如前所述，仁就是爱邻和仁慈；它是上古教会较低级的爱。爱就这样下降，变得越来越外在，并且要被称为仁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]615.</strong> The present verse offers a general picture of the people of this church — not what they were already like but what they could become. (Future chapters deal with the actual formation of this character [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_615/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_838" target=_top>838</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_615/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_977" target=_top>977-979</a>].) Specifically, through religious knowledge they would be able to receive the gift of charitable feeling. In this way they would be able to act out of charity, and the goodness connected with charity would allow them to recognize what was true. So the goodness of charity (being just) comes first and the truth of charity (being upright) second.<br />Charity, as noted before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_615/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_325" target=_top>325</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_615/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_351" target=_top>351</a>], is love for our fellow human beings and is mercy. It is a lower grade of love than that which marked the earliest church, whose love was directed toward the Lord. As you can see, love is now declining and becoming shallower, so that it has to be termed charity. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 615</b></p><p><b>615.</b>
The quality of the man of this church is here described in general; not that he was such as yet-for his formation is treated of in what follows-but that such he might become: that is to say, that by 
knowledges of faith he could be endowed with charity, and so act from charity, and from the good of charity know what is true. For this reason the good of charity or "righteous" precedes, and the truth 
of charity or "perfect" follows. Charity, as before said, is love toward the neighbor and mercy; and it is a lower degree of the love of the Most Ancient Church, which was love to the Lord. Thus love 
now descended and became more external, and is to be called charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 615</b></p><p><b>615.</b>
Described here in general is the nature of the member of this Church, not what he still in fact was but what he was capable of becoming, for what follows concerns the forming of such a man; that is to 
say, he was one on whom it was possible to confer charity through cognitions of faith, so that he could act from charity, and from the good which stems from charity recognize what truth is. This is 
why the good of charity, or being 'a righteous person', comes first, and the truth of charity, or being 'a blameless person', follows. As already stated, charity is love towards the neighbour, and mercy, 
and is a lower grade of the love found in the Most Ancient Church which was love to the Lord. In this way love assumed a lower position and became more external, and must be referred to as charity.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 615</b>
</p><b>615.</b>
Describitur hic in communi, qualis homo hujus Ecclesiae, non quod ita adhuc fuit, in sequentibus enim agitur de ejus formatione, sed qualis potuit fieri; scilicet quod per cognitiones fidei donari potuisset 
charitate, et sic a charitate agere, et ex bono charitatis cognoscere quid verum; quare bonum charitatis seu 'justus' praecedit, et verum charitatis seu 'integer' sequitur.  Charitas est, ut 
prius dictum amor erga proximum, et misericordia, estque inferior gradus amoris qui fuit Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, qui amor fuit in Dominum: ita nunc descendit et exterior factus; et appellandus charitas. </p>
