<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4378节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4378.</strong>“牛羊也正我管喂奶的时候”表尚未获得神性生命的良善，无论内层良善还是属世良善。这从“牛羊”和“喂奶”的含义清楚可知：“羊”是指内层良善（<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>，<a href="3783.htm">3783</a>节）；“牛”是指外层或属世良善（<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）；“喂奶”也是指新近的良善，在此是指正在属世层里面出生的属灵良善。<br />在正重生之人所经历的婴儿状态下，属灵事物潜藏于内；因为属灵生命仿佛从蛋中孵化，逐渐从一个时期发展到另一个时期。婴儿时期可以说是童年时期的蛋，童年时期可以说是青少年时期的蛋，青少年时期可以说是成年时期的蛋，以致此人可以说在反复经历出生。由此明显可知，尚未获得神性生命、在此由吃奶的牛羊所表示的良善，无论内层良善还是属世良善是什么意思。也可参看刚才有关婴儿状态的阐述（<a href="4377.htm">4377</a>节）。</p>

And that the flocks and the herds are suckling with me. That this signifies goods both interior and natural, which as yet have not acquired Divine life, is evident from the signification of "flocks," 
as being interior goods (n. 2566, 3783); and from the signification of "herds," as being exterior or natural goods (n. 2566, and further, n. 2180, 2781); and from the signification of "suckling," as 
being also recent goods, here spiritual goods that are being born in the natural. For in the state of infancy (in relation to the regeneration of man) spiritual things are in potency within; for spiritual 
life develops successively from one age to another, as from an egg. The age of infancy is as an egg to the age of childhood, and the age of childhood is as an egg to the age of youth and early manhood, 
and this as an egg to adult age; so that man is as it were being born continually. From this it is evident what is meant by goods both interior and natural which as yet have not acquired Divine 
life, and which are here signified by the flocks and the herds that are suckling. (See also what was said just above concerning the state of infancy, n. 4377.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4378</b></p><p><b>4378.</b>
'And the flocks and herds with me are suckling' means goods, interior ones and natural ones, which have not yet acquired Divine life. This is clear from the meaning of 'flocks' as interior goods, dealt 
with in <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, <a href="3783.htm">3783</a>; from the meaning of 'herds' as exterior or natural goods, in <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, and in addition in <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>; and from the meaning of 'sucklings' as goods which also are recent, and are in 
this case spiritual ones that am being born within the natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the state of infancy that a person passes through when being regenerated spiritual things are present in potentiality, for spiritual 
life emerges, as if from an egg, out of each consecutive age. The phase of infancy is so to speak the egg for that of childhood; the phase of childhood is so to speak the egg for that of adolescence 
and youth; and this phase is as it were the egg for that of adult years. Thus the person is so to speak repeatedly experiencing birth. This shows what is implied by goods, interior ones and natural 
ones, which have not yet acquired Divine life, meant here by 'flocks and herds that are suckling'. See also what has been stated immediately above in <a href="4377.htm">4377</a> about the state of infancy. </p>

</p><b>4378.</b>
`Et greges et armenta lactentia apud me': quod significet bona interiora et naturalia quae adhuc non vitam Divinam adepta, constat a significatione `gregum' quod sint bona interiora, de qua n. 2566, 
3783; ex significatione `armentorum' quod sint bona exteriora seu naturalia, n. 2566, et praeterea n. 2180, 2781; et ex significatione `lactentium' quod quoque sint recentia, hic spiritualia nascentia 
in naturali; [2] in statu enim infantiae cum regeneratur homo, spiritualia insunt potentia, nam spiritualis vita successive prodit a quacumque aetate, sicut ab ovo; aetas infantiae est quasi 
ovum aetati pueritiae, et aetas pueritiae est quasi ovum aetati adolescentiae et juventutis, et haec sicut ovum aetati adultae; sic quasi continue nascitur homo; inde patet quid intelligitur per bona 
interiora et naturalia quae adhuc non vitam Divinam adepta, quae hic significantur per `greges et armenta lactentia'; videantur etiam quae mox supra n. 4377 de infantiae {1} statu dicta sunt.
