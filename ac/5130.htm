<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5130节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5130.</strong>“但求你记念我”表对信仰的接受。这从“约瑟”的代表和“求你记念我”的含义清楚可知：指着自己说这些话的“约瑟”是指属世层里面的属天层方面的主（参看<a href="5086.htm">5086</a>，<a href="5087.htm">5087</a>，<a href="5106.htm">5106</a>节）；“求你记念我”是指对信仰的接受；因为主的记念和顾念唯独从信仰流入。因此，“求你记念我”表示好叫他接受信仰，意味着接受信仰的渴望。至于信仰，情况是这样：凡接受并拥有信仰的人不断被主顾念。甚至当他在思想或谈论其它事，而非主之时，或当他履行他的公共、私人或家庭职责时，也是是如此，尽管他没有直接意识到，那时他正被主顾念；因为存在于那些拥有信仰的人里面的主之顾念主导他们的整个生命，但他们没有注意到那主导他们整个生命之物，除非他们的思维直接转向这个问题。<br />这一点可通过人性的各个方面来说明。一个被某种爱所主宰的人，无论这爱是什么，总是思想与这爱有关的事。即便其它事占据他的思维、言语或行为，情况仍是这样。在来世，这一点从围绕每个人的属灵气场很明显地看出来。仅从这些气场就能知道那里的所有人处于什么样的信仰、什么样的爱，哪怕他们可能正在思想或谈论某种完全相反的事（参看<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>-<a href="1520.htm">1520</a>，<a href="2489.htm">2489</a>，<a href="4464.htm">4464</a>节）。因为那主导人整个生命之物产生围绕他的气场，在其他人面前展示他的生命。由此可见“我们必须不断思想主、救恩和死后生命”这句话是什么意思。凡拥有基于仁之信的人都如此行，所以他们不会对自己的邻舍心怀恶念，公义与公平便存在于其思维、言行的方方面面；因为那主导人的整个生命之物进入它的一切具体方面，既引导它，也掌控它。事实上，主将心智保持在诸如属于仁爱，因而系信仰事务的那类事物中，并在如此行的过程中把心智里面的每一个事物都放在它合适的位置上。基于仁之信的气场是在天堂掌权的气场；因为主以爱，并通过爱以仁，因而以属于信的真理流入。这解释了为什么说那些在天堂里的人在主里面。<br />接下来论述的主题是受理解力部分支配的感官能力的重生，该感官能力由“酒政”来代表；既是在论述它的重生，也就是在论述对信仰的接受。因为和理性层一样，感官层也通过信仰重生，不过是通过有仁爱所流入其中的信仰重生。除非仁爱流入信仰，并赋予它生命，否则信仰不可能普遍掌权，或存在于人的整个生命中；因为在人里面掌权的，是人所爱的，而非他仅仅知道并保留在他记忆里的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5130</b></p><p><b>5130.</b>
But remember me with thee. That this signifies the reception of faith, is evident from the representation of Joseph, who says these things of himself, as being the Lord as to the celestial in the natural 
(see n. 5086, 5087, 5106); and from the signification of "remember me with thee," as being the reception of faith; for to remember and to be mindful of the Lord is from no other source than faith; 
hence "remember me with thee," denotes that he may receive faith. The case in regard to faith is this: he who receives and has faith is continually mindful of the Lord, even when he is thinking or speaking 
of other things, and also when he is discharging his public, private, or domestic duties, although he is not aware that he is then mindful of the Lord; for the remembrance of the Lord by those 
who are in faith reigns universally with them, and what reigns universally is not perceived, except while the thought is directed to it. 
 </p>
<p>[2] This may be illustrated by various things with man. He who 
is in any love, whatever it may be, is continually thinking about whatever belongs to that love; and this although he is engaged in thought, in speech, or in action relative to other things. In the 
other life this is very evident from the spiritual spheres about everyone; for simply from these spheres it is known in what faith and in what love are all who are there, and this even though they are 
thinking and speaking of something entirely different (see n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1520, 2489, 4464); for that which reigns universally in anyone produces a sphere of the same, and displays his life 
before others. From this may be seen what is meant when it is said that we must be constantly thinking about the Lord, salvation, and the life after death. All who are in faith from charity do this, 
and therefore they do not think ill of the neighbor, and they have justice and equity in everything of their thought, speech, and action; for that which reigns universally flows into particulars and 
guides and governs them, because the Lord keeps the mind in such things as are of charity and the derivative faith and thus disposes everything in conformity therewith. The sphere of faith from charity 
is the sphere which reigns in heaven; for the Lord flows in with love, and through love with charity, consequently with the truths which are of faith; and from this they who are in heaven are said to 
be in the Lord.  
 </p>
<p>[3] In what now follows the subject treated of is the rebirth of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and which is represented by the butler; and because its rebirth is treated 
of, the reception of faith is also treated of. For the sensuous, like the rational, is born again by means of faith, but by the faith into which charity flows. Unless charity flows into faith and 
gives it life, faith cannot reign universally; for what a man loves reigns, and not what he merely knows and holds in his memory. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5130</b></p><p><b>5130.</b>
'But remember me' means the reception of faith. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph', who says this about himself, as the Lord as regards the celestial within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5086.htm">5086</a>, <a href="5087.htm">5087</a>, <a href="5106.htm">5106</a>; and from the meaning of 'remember me' as the reception of faith, for remembering and being mindful of the Lord do not flow from anything other than faith. Consequently 'remember me' 
implies a desire to receive faith. As regards faith, anyone who receives and possesses faith is constantly mindful of the Lord. This is so even when he is thinking or talking about something other than 
Him, or else when he is carrying out his public, private, or family duties, though he is not directly conscious of his mindfulness of the Lord while he is carrying them out. Indeed that mindfulness 
of the Lord present in those who possess faith governs their whole being, but that which governs their whole being is not noticed by them except when they turn their thought specifically to that matter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
This may be illustrated by many aspects of human character. One who is governed by some love, whatever this may be, is thinking constantly about things connected with that love. This is so even 
when other matters occupy his mind, conversation, or action. This is quite evident in the next life from the spiritual spheres which surround everyone individually. From those spheres alone one can 
detect what the faith is and what the love is that are present in all who are there, even though they may be thinking or talking about something completely different, <a href="1048.htm">1048</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="1504.htm">1504</a>-<a href="1520.htm">1520</a>, <a href="2489.htm">2489</a>, 
<a href="4464.htm">4464</a>. For that which governs a person's whole being produces the sphere surrounding him and reveals to others what his life is. From this one may see what is meant by the statement that one ought 
to be thinking constantly about the Lord, salvation, and life after death. All who possess faith that is grounded in charity do so, as a consequence of which they do not entertain evil thoughts regarding 
their neighbour, and that which is just and fair is present in every aspect of their thought, speech, and action; for that which governs the person's whole being enters every particular aspect of 
it, both leading it and controlling it. Indeed the Lord holds the mind to those concerns that are charitable and are therefore matters of faith, and in so doing He fits every single thing in the mind 
into its proper place. The sphere of faith grounded in charity is the sphere which reigns in heaven, for the Lord flows in with love, and by means of love with charity, and as a consequence with truths 
which are the truths of faith. This explains why those in heaven are said to be in the Lord. The subject in what follows next is the rebirth of the sensory power subject to the understanding part represented 
by 'the cupbearer'; and as the rebirth of this is the subject, so also is the reception of faith. Indeed sensory awareness, like the rational, is born again by means of faith, but by faith into 
which charity is flowing. Unless charity flows into faith and imparts life to it, faith cannot possibly exist throughout a person's whole being, for it is what a person loves that reigns in him, not 
what he merely knows and retains in his memory. </p>

`Verum memento mei tecum':  quod significet fidei receptionem, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' qui haec de se dicit, quod sit Dominus quoad caeleste in naturali, de qua n. 5086, 5087, 5106; 
et ex significatione `meminisse mei tecum' quod sit fidei receptio, meminisse enim et recordari Domini, non aliunde est quam ex fide, inde `memento mei tecum' est ut recipiat fidem. Cum fide ita se 
habet:  qui illam recipit et qui illam habet, continue est in recordatione Domini, et hoc quoque cum de alia re cogitat aut loquitur, et quoque cum officiis suis publicis aut privatis aut domesticis 
fungitur, et tametsi nescit quod tunc recordetur Domini; </p>
<p>nam recordatio Domini ab illis qui in fide sunt, est universaliter regnans, et quod universaliter regnat, hoc non appercipitur nisi dum 
cogitatio illuc determinatur:  [2] hoc illustrari potest a pluribus apud hominem; qui in amore aliquo est, quicumque sit, is continue cogitat de (e)iis quae amoris illius sunt et hoc tametsi in aliis 
rebus cogitatione, loquela aut actione est; hoc patet manifeste in altera vita (c)ex sphaeris spiritualibus quae circum {1}unumquemque sunt; ex solum sphaeris cognoscuntur ibi omnes in qua fide 
sunt, et in quo amore, et hoc tametsi prorsus aliud cogitant {2}et loquuntur, n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1520, 2489, 4464; id enim quod universaliter regnat apud aliquem, hoc producit illam sphaeram 
et manifestat ejus vitam coram aliis; inde constare potest quid intelligitur per id quod continue cogitandum sit de Domino, de salute, deque vita post mortem; omnes qui in fide sunt ex charitate, 
hoc faciunt; inde est quod illi non male cogitent de proximo, et quod illis justitia et aequitas in singulis cogitationis, loquelae et actionis; quod enim universaliter regnat, hoc influit in singula, 
et ducit illa et regit illa; Dominus enim tenet mentem ejus in talibus quae charitatis et inde fidei sunt, et disponit sic singula convenienter; sphaera fidei ex charitate, est sphaera quae regnat 
in caelo; Dominus enim influit cum amore et per amorem cum charitate, consequenter cum veris quae sunt fidei; inde est quod illi qui in caelo sunt, dicantur in Domino esse.  [3] Agitur in his quae 
nunc sequuntur de renascentia sensualis parti intellectuali subjecti, quod per `pincernam' repraesentatur; et quia de renascentia ejus, de fidei receptione agitur; nam sensuale sicut rationale, 
per fidem renascitur, sed per fidem in quam influit charitas; nisi charitas influat in fidem et det ei vitam, nusquam fides universaliter regnare potest, nam quod homo amat, hoc regnat, non autem 
quod solum scit et memoria tenet. @1 unumquemvis$ @2 aut$ </p>
