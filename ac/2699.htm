<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2699节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2699.</strong>“因为我要使他成为一大民族”表属灵的教会。这从“一大民族”的含义清楚可知，“一大民族”是指属灵的教会，该教会将接受信之良善（参看<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>节）。经上之所以说“一大民族”，是因为属灵国度是主的第二国度，如2669节所述。 以实玛利因代表属灵教会成员，故也代表属灵教会本身，以及主在天上的属灵国度；因为这一个的形像和样式就存在于另一个中。前一节描述了荒凉后的第一状态，就是一种安慰和相助之望的状态。本节则描述了荒凉后的第二状态，就是一种启示并由启示所产生的精神焕发的状态。<br />这些状态不为世人所知，因为如前所述，如今很少有人正在重生，故我们可以描述那些在来世正在重生之人的状态，在那里，这种状态是众所周知的。因帮助的希望而得安慰之后，那些在来世经历消磨或荒凉的人就是被主提入天堂，因而从幽暗的状态，就是无知的状态，进入光明的状态，就是启示和由此而来的精神焕发的状态，从而进入感染其至内在的喜乐中。事实上，他们所进入的光明具有这样的性质，即它能使他们不仅用眼观看，同时还能用理解力观看。从他们所摆脱的相对状态可以看出这光将他们更新到什么程度。有的具有孩子般的性情和简单的信仰，那时看似穿着闪亮的白衣；有的戴着王冠；有的被带到各个天使社群，到处得到兄弟般仁慈的接纳；凡给他们的新生活增添快乐的一切良善都被提供给他们：有的得以见识到天堂或主国度的浩翰，同时觉察到那里的人的幸福；除此之外还有无数其它难以描述的事物。这就是那些从荒凉出来的人所具有的最初启示和由此而来的精神焕发的状态</p>

For I will make him a great nation. That this signifies the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of a "great nation," as being the spiritual church, which will receive the good of faith 
(see above, n. 2669). It is said a "great nation," because the spiritual kingdom is the Lord's second kingdom (spoken of also in the same number). As the man of the spiritual church is represented by 
Ishmael, so also is the spiritual church itself represented by him, and also the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens; for the image and likeness of the one is in the other. The first state after 
desolation was described in the preceding verse, which was a state of consolation and of the hope of help. Their second state after desolation is described in this verse, which is a state of enlightenment 
and of refreshment therefrom. [2] As these states are unknown in the world, for the reason as before said that at this day few are being regenerated, we may describe the state of those who are 
being regenerated in the other life, where it is most fully known. Those who have been in vastation or desolation there, after being comforted by the hope of help, are elevated by the Lord into heaven, 
thus from a state of shade which is a state of ignorance, into a state of light which is a state of enlightenment and of the refreshment therefrom, thus into a joy that affects their inmosts. It is 
actually light into which they come, of such a quality as to enlighten not only their sight, but also their understanding at the same time; and how much this light refreshes them may be seen from the 
opposite state, from which they have been delivered. Some who had been of an infantile disposition and of simple faith, then appear to themselves in white and shining garments; some with crowns; some 
are taken around to various angelic societies, and are everywhere received with charity as brethren; and whatever of good is gratifying to their new life is shown them: to some it is given to see the 
immensity of heaven, or of the Lord's kingdom, and at the same time to perceive the blessedness of those who are there; besides innumerable other things which cannot be described. Such is the state of 
the first enlightenment, and of the refreshment therefrom with those who come out of desolation. </p>

'For I will make him into a great nation' means the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'a great nation' as the spiritual Church which was to receive the good of faith, dealt with above 
in <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>. The expression 'a great nation' is used because the spiritual kingdom is the Lord's second kingdom, also dealt with in that same paragraph. As the member of the spiritual Church is represented 
by Ishmael, so also is the spiritual Church itself represented by him, as well as the Lord's spiritual kingdom in heaven; for the image and likeness of the one exists in the other. The first state 
following desolation was described in the previous verse, which was a state of comfort and of the hope of help. Their second state following desolation is described in the present verse, which is a 
state of enlightenment and of renewal resulting from this enlightenment. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since these states are unknown in the world, for the reason mentioned previously that few at the present day are being regenerated, 
let the nature of this state be described as it is experienced by those who are being regenerated in the next life, where that state is very well known. After being comforted with the hope 
of help, those in the next life who have experienced vastation or desolation are raised up by the Lord into heaven, thus from a state of shade, which is a state of ignorance, into a state of light, which 
is a state of enlightenment and of resulting renewal, and so into joy which stirs their inmost feelings. It is indeed light into which they enter, of such a nature that it enables them to see not 
only with their eyes but also at the same time with their understanding. How much this light renews them may become clear from the contrary state from which they have been released. At that time some 
who have had a childlike disposition and whose faith has been simple appear to themselves in dazzling white garments. Some appear wearing crowns. Some are taken round to many angelic communities and 
are everywhere received charitably as brothers; and therefore all good that is gratifying to their new life is offered to them. Some are allowed to observe the vastness of heaven, that is, of the Lord's 
kingdom, and at the same time to discern the blessedness of those who are there, in addition to countless other things there which defy description. Such is the state of initial enlightenment, and 
of the feeling of renewal resulting from this, of all who come out of desolation. </p>

`Quia in gentem magnam ponam illum': quod significet Ecclesiam spiritualem, constat a significatione `gentis magnae' quod sit Ecclesia spiritualis quae acceptura bonum fidei, de qua supra n. 2669; `gens 
magna' dicitur, quia regnum spirituale est alterum regnum Domini, de quo etiam in loco citato: per `Ismaelem,' sicut repraesentatur Ecclesiae spiritualis homo, ita quoque repraesentatur ipsa Ecclesia 
spiritualis, tum quoque regnum spirituale Domini in caelis, nam imago et similitudo unius est in altero.  Primus status post desolationem descriptus est in versu praecedente, qui fuit status consolationis 
et spei auxilii; alter eorum status post desolationem describitur in hoc versu, qui est status illustrationis et recreationis inde: [2] quia {1} status hi ignoti sunt in mundo, ex causa quia 
pauci hodie, ut dictum prius, regenerantur, licet referre qualis hic status est eorum in altera vita ubi notissimus; ibi qui in vastatione seu desolatione fuerunt, postquam consolati spe auxilii, elevantur 
a Domino in caelum, ita a statu umbrae qui est status ignorantiae, in statum lucis qui est status illustrationis et recreationis inde, ita in gaudium, quod intima eorum afficit; est actualiter 
lux in quam veniunt, quae talis est ut non solum illustret visum sed etiam simul intellectum, quae lux quantum eos recreat, constare potest a statu opposito, e quo liberati; quidam tunc qui infantili 
animo fuerunt et simplici fide, apparent sibi in albis et candidis; quidam in coronis; quidam ad plures societates angelicas circumvehuntur, et ubique recipiuntur cum charitate ut fratres, et ibi {2} 
quicquid boni vitae eorum novae gratificatur, illis {2} exhibetur; quibusdam immensitatem caeli seu regni Domini videre, et simul beatitudinem eorum qui ibi, appercipere datur; praeter innumerabilia alia 
quae non describi possunt. Talis est status primae illustrationis et inde recreationis eorum qui e desolatione veniunt. 	@1 i at.$ 	@2 trs ibi and illis.$ </p>
