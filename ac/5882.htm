<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5882节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5882.</strong>“约瑟又对他弟兄们说”表对新属世层的觉知。这从“说”的含义和“雅各儿子们”的代表清楚可知：“说”是指觉知，如前所述（<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）；“雅各的儿子们”是指属世层中的真理，如前所述（<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节），在此是指属世层本身，因为代表属世层中的真理的，也代表属世层本身，正如因是埃及王而代表总体上的记忆知识的法老也代表总体上的属世层本身一样（<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>，<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>节）。属世层中的真理和属世层本身，或属世人本身行如一体，因为真理是所容纳之物，而属世层是容纳它们的容器；由于它们行如一体，所以在内义上照思路时而表示容纳的容器，时而表示所容纳之物。雅各的儿子们在此之所以代表新的属世层，是因为内义在此描述的是联结的实现；一般来说，这种联结正如前面所给出的大体解释（<a href="5867.htm">5867</a>节），即：当内在与外在，或良善与真理正在联结时，觉知的能力首先被赐下，以便此人被对真理，因而对良善的一种情感所打动；那时，他会经历动荡，接着一种更内在的交流通过流注得以建立，等等。由此明显可知，“雅各的儿子们”在此所代表的属世层是一个新的属世层，因为它之前的状态发生了改变（<a href="5881.htm">5881</a>节）。</p>

And Joseph said unto his brethren. That this signifies the perception of the new natural, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which see above, n. 5877); and from the 
representation of the sons of Jacob, as being truths in the natural (of which also above, n. 5877), here the natural; for they who represent truths in the natural, represent also the natural itself-as 
Pharaoh, who, as he represents memory-knowledges in general, because he was king of Egypt, also represents the natural itself in general (n. 5160, 5799). The truths in the natural, and the natural 
itself, or the natural man himself, act as a one, for truths are the contents, and the natural is the containant; and therefore in the internal sense the containant is now signified, and now the content, 
according to the series of the things. The reason why the sons of Jacob here represent the new natural is that in the internal sense is here described the act of conjunction, which-to speak generally-is 
in accordance with the things that are contained in the general explication; namely, that when there takes place a conjunction of the internal with the external, or of good with truth, there is 
first bestowed a capacity of perception that the man is affected with truth and thus with good, and that then a commotion is felt; next that an interior communication is given by means of influx; and 
so on. From this it is plain that the natural which the sons of Jacob here represent is the new natural, for its former state has been changed (n. 5881). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5882</b></p><p><b>5882.</b>
'And Joseph said to his brothers' means the perception of a new natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perception, dealt with above in <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>; and from the representation of 'Jacob's sons' 
as the truths in the natural, also dealt with above in <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>, in this case the natural itself since those who represent the truths in the natural also represent the natural itself, just as Pharaoh, 
representing factual knowledge in general because he was the king of Egypt, also represents the natural itself in general, <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>, <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>. The truths there and the natural (or the natural man) itself act 
as one, for the truths are the contents and the natural their container; and because they act as one the container is meant at one point in the internal sense, the content at another, depending on what 
the train of thought is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'the sons of Jacob' here represent a new natural is that the internal sense at this point describes the accomplishment of the joining together which in 
general terms is effected as the overall explanation [given in <a href="5867.htm">5867</a>] indicates, which is this: When the joining together of the internal and the external, or of good and truth, takes place, there is 
first imparted a power of perception that the person is moved by an affection for truth and thus for good; at that time he goes through turmoil, after which a more internal communication is established 
through influx, and so on. From all this it is evident that the natural, which 'the sons of Jacob' represent here, is a new natural, for its previous state has undergone change, <a href="5881.htm">5881</a>. </p>

`Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos': quod significet perceptionem novi naturalis, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit perceptio, de qua supra n. 5877; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Jacobi' 
quod sint vera in naturali, de qua etiam supra n. 5877, hic naturale; qui enim vera in naturali, etiam ipsum naturale, repraesentant; sicut `Pharaoh' qui, quia scientifica in communi, {1}quoniam rex Aegypti, 
etiam ipsum naturale in communi repraesentat, n. (x)5160, 5799; vera {2} ibi et ipsum naturale seu ipse naturalis homo unum agunt, nam vera sunt contenta et naturale continens; quapropter in sensu 
interno jam continens significatur, jam contentum, secundum seriem rerum. [2] Quod `filii Jacobi' hic repraesentent naturale novum, est quia in sensu interno hic describitur actus conjunctionis, 
qui est secundum illa in genere, quae in explicatione communi; quod nempe cum conjunctio existit {3}interni cum externo, seu boni cum vero, primum detur facultas perceptionis quod homo afficiatur vero, 
et sic bono, et quod tunc commotio sentiatur; dein quod communicatio detur interior per influxum, et sic porro; ex his patet quod naturale quod `filii Jacobi' hic repraesentant, sit naturale novum, 
nam status ejus prior mutatus est, n. 5881. @1 quia$ @2 i enim$ @3 ab interno seu bono, hoc est, per illud a Domino$ </p>
