<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>597.</strong>“挪亚”是指一个新教会，这个新教会要被称为古教会，以区别于大洪水前后的上古教会。这两个教会的状态截然不同。上古教会的状态是这样，他们从主获得对善及其衍生之真的觉察。古教会，或说“挪亚”的状态则是，他们拥有对善与真的良知。有觉察和有良知之间差别的性质决定了上古教会与古教会状态上的差别。觉察不是良知：属天者拥有觉察；属灵者拥有良知。上古教会是属天的，而古教会是属灵的。<br />②上古教会从主直接获得启示，既通过与精灵和天使交往，也藉由异象和梦境。这些经验能使他们大体知道何为善与真；一旦他们以这种方式知道它们，那么他们这种大致的，或可以说初步的认知就会被无数经由觉察所获取的细节所确证。这无数细节构成他们与之相关的大致认知的具体和个体的方方面面，大致或可以说初步的认知就这样日益被印证。凡不符合大致认知的东西，他们就觉得不是，凡符合的，则觉得就是，这也是属天之人的状态。<br />③上古教会这种大致或可以说初步的认知就是属天和永恒的真理：例如，主统管整个宇宙；主是一切善与真的源头；主是一切生命之源；人的自我中心无非是恶，本身就是死物，以及诸如此类的其它一般真理。他们通过主觉察确证和支持这些真理的无数因素。对于这些人来说，爱是信的首要之事，主许他们经由爱觉察属信之物。因此，信对他们而言就是爱，如前所述。而古教会则全然不同，对此，蒙主慈悲，以后讨论。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]597.</strong> Noah symbolizes a new church, called the ancient church in order to distinguish between the very earliest church, which preceded the Flood, and the church that followed the Flood.<br />The states of these two churches were entirely different. That of the earliest church was to receive a perception of good, and so of truth, from the Lord. In the ancient church — "Noah" — the state changed to one of conscience concerning goodness and truth. The difference between conditions in the earliest church and in the ancient church was the difference between having perception and having conscience. Perception is not conscience. Heavenly angels have perception; spiritual angels have conscience. The earliest church was heavenly, but the ancient church was spiritual.<br />[2] The earliest church experienced direct revelation through personal contact with spirits and angels and also through visions and dreams sent by the Lord. These gave them a general ability to recognize what was good and true, and having recognized this, they confirmed the generalities (axioms, more or less) by countless insights gained through perception. These insights constituted particular details filling in the broad categories to which they belonged. In this way, daily experience corroborated general principle. Whenever they came across something that did not agree with general principle, they perceived that it was wrong, and whenever they came across something that agreed, they perceived that it was right. Heavenly angels are in the same state.<br />[3] The broad principles of the earliest church — its axioms, in effect — were heavenly, eternal truths. They included the idea that the Lord governs the universe, that he is the source of all goodness and truth and of all life, that our selfhood is pure evil and of itself is dead, and other ideas like these. The people of that church received from the Lord a perception of countless thoughts supporting and harmonizing with these principles.<br />To them, love was the most important element of faith. It was through love that the Lord enabled them to perceive everything belonging to faith, and so faith to them was love, as already stated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32#subsection-2-2" target=_top>32:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202" target=_top>202</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398" target=_top>398</a>].<br />The ancient church, on the other hand, became totally different, as later sections will reveal, by the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The rest of the discussion of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_1-22" target=_top>Genesis 6</a> and all the treatment of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_1-24" target=_top>Genesis 7</a> and 8 concern this shift.

By "Noah" is signified a new church, which is to be called the Ancient Church, for the sake of distinction between the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, and that which was after the flood. 
The states of these two churches were entirely different. The state of the Most Ancient Church was such that they had from the Lord a perception of good and the derivative truth. The state of the 
Ancient Church, or "Noah" became such that they had a conscience of good and truth. Such as is the difference between having perception and having conscience, such was the difference of state of the 
Most Ancient and the Ancient Churches. Perception is not conscience: the celestial have perception; the spiritual have conscience. The Most Ancient Church was celestial, the Ancient was spiritual.  [2] 
The Most Ancient Church had immediate revelation from the Lord by consort with spirits and angels, as also by visions and dreams; whereby it was given them to have a general knowledge of what was good 
and true; and after they had acquired a general knowledge, these general leading principles, as we may call them, were confirmed by things innumerable, by means of perceptions; and these innumerable 
things were the particulars or individual things of the general principles to which they related. Thus were the general leading principles corroborated day by day; whatever was not in agreement with 
the general principles they perceived not to be so; and whatever was in agreement with them they perceived to be so. Such also is the state of the celestial angels. [3] The general principles of the 
Most Ancient Church were heavenly and eternal truths-as that the Lord governs the universe, that all good and truth is from the Lord, that all life is from the Lord, that man's Own is nothing but evil, 
and in itself is dead; with many others of similar character. And they received from the Lord a perception of countless things that confirmed and supported these truths. With them love was the principal 
of faith. By love it was given them of the Lord to perceive whatever was of faith, and hence with them faith was love, as was said before. But the Ancient Church became entirely different, concerning 
which of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

'Noah' means a new Church, which must be called the Ancient Church to distinguish between the Most Ancient Church before the Flood and the Church that followed it. The states of those two Churches were 
entirely different. The state of the Most Ancient Church was one in which people had from the Lord a perception of good and of truth deriving from it, while that of the Ancient Church, or Noah, came 
to be one in which it had a conscience concerning good and truth. The nature of the difference between having perception and having conscience is what determined the difference in state between the 
Most Ancient Church and the Ancient.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Perception is not the same as conscience. Celestial people have perception, spiritual people conscience. The Most Ancient Church was celestial whereas the 
Ancient was spiritual. The Most Ancient Church possessed immediate revelation through direct contact with spirits and angels, and also through visions and dreams from the Lord. These experiences enabled 
them to know in a general way what good and truth were, and once they knew them in this general way their general or so to speak primary matters of knowledge were confirmed by means of countless details 
acquired through perceptions. These countless details constituted the particular and the individual aspects of the general knowledge to which they had reference. In this manner general or so to 
speak primary knowledge was being corroborated day by day. If anything was not in keeping with general matters of knowledge they perceived that it was not; and if anything was in keeping they perceived 
that it was. Such is also the state of celestial angels.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The general, so to speak primary, matters of knowledge of the Most Ancient Church were celestial and eternal truths: for example, that 
the Lord governs the whole universe; that the Lord is the source of all good and truth; that the Lord is the source of all life; that man's proprium was nothing but evil, and in itself something dead; 
in addition to other general truths such as these. And they received from the Lord a perception of countless considerations confirming and harmonizing with these truths. For those people love was the 
chief thing of faith, and through love they were allowed by the Lord to perceive anything that was a matter of faith. Consequently faith to them was love, as stated already. The Ancient Church however 
became entirely different. That difference will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on.  </p>

{1} Per 'Noahum' significatur nova Ecclesia, quae Ecclesia Antiqua vocanda, ad distinguendum inter Ecclesiam Antiquissimam quae fuit ante diluvium, et illam quae fuit post diluvium.  Ecclesiarum illarum 
prorsus diversi status fuerunt; Ecclesiae Antiquissimae status fuit ut perceptionem boni et inde veri habuerint a Domino; Antiquae Ecclesiae seu 'Noahi' status factus ut conscientiam boni et veri 
haberet: qualis differentia est inter habere perceptionem et habere conscientiam, talis differentia status fuit Ecclesiae Antiquissimae et Ecclesiae Antiquae; [2] perceptio non est conscientia; perceptionem 
habent caelestes, conscientiam spirituales:  Antiquissima Ecclesia fuit caelestis sed Antiqua spiritualis. Antiquissima Ecclesia revelationem immediatam habuit per consortium cum spiritibus et 
angelis, ut et per visiones et somnia a Domino, ex quibus communiter quid bonum et verum illis nosse datum, et postquam communiter noverunt, tunc confirmata sunt communia illa quasi principia innumerabilibus 
per perceptiones; quae innumerabilia erant particularia seu singularia communium ad quae se referebant; ita communia quasi principia corroborabantur cotidie; quicquid non congruebat communibus, 
hoc perceperunt non ita esse, et quicquid congruebat, perceperunt ita esse; talis status etiam est angelorum caelestium: Antiquissimae Ecclesiae communia quasi principia erant veritates caelestes 
et aeternae; sicut, quod Dominus regat universum; quod a Domino omne bonum et verum; quod a Domino omnis vita; quod proprium hominis non esset nisi malam, et quod esset mortuum in se; praeter similia 
alia; innumerabilium illa confirmantium et consentientium perceptionem acceperunt a Domino: illis amor erat principale fidei; per amorem percipere iis datum a Domino quicquid esset fidei; inde fides illis 
erat amor, ut prius dictum. Sed Antiqua Ecclesia alia prorsus facta fuit, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. @	1 I has Quod per Noahum significetur and the clause is unfinished, 
unless it be regarded as a title for the subject discussed in the following paragraph, which is contrary to S. usage, and so in next [?].  Possibly a 'constat ex significatione' clause has been omitted 
here and in next [?]$ </p>
