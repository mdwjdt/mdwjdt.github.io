<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6413节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6413.</strong>“是被释放的母鹿”表属世情感所拥有的自由。这从“母鹿”和“被释放”的含义清楚可知：“母鹿”是指属世情感，如下文所述；“被释放”是指自由，因为当被捕获的母鹿获得释放时，它就有了自由。从试探的状态解脱出来好比“被释放的母鹿”，因为母鹿是一种森林动物，比其它所有动物都更喜欢自由。在这方面属世层与它类似；因为属世层也喜欢处于其情感的快乐，因而处于自由之中；自由是情感的特征。“母鹿”表示属世情感的原因是，它是用来表示（良善）情感的动物之一；所有这类动物都可用作食物，是有用的生物，如羔羊、绵羊、母山羊、小山羊、公山羊，以及公牛、小公牛，以及母牛。然而，这些动物也用来表示属灵情感，因为燔祭和祭牲是由它们作成的；而“母鹿”因没有这样的功用，故用来表示属世情感。关于“动物”表示情感，可参看前文（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="719.htm">719</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>节）；它们表示情感的事实来源于灵人界的代表（<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>节）。<br />在诗篇，“母鹿”也表示属世情感：<br />耶和华使我的脚像母鹿的蹄，又使我在高处安稳。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.33.htm">18:33</a>）<br />哈巴谷书：<br />主耶和华是我的力量！祂使我的脚快如母鹿的蹄，又使我稳行在高处。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.19.htm">3:19</a>）<br />“使脚像母鹿的蹄”表示在情感自由中的属世层，“脚”是指属世层（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>节）。“使脚像母鹿的蹄”所具有的这层含义可从以下事实看出来：使人的脚像母鹿的蹄那样敏捷、适合奔跑，并不是什么属灵之物；然而的确含有某种属灵之物，这从接下来的经文明显可知：“耶和华使他在高处安稳，又使他稳行在高处”，以此表示在属世情感之上的属灵情感。这同样适用于以赛亚书中的这些话：<br />瘸子必跳跃像鹿。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.6.htm">35:6</a>）<br />“瘸子”表示虽处于良善，但并非处于真正的良善之人（<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>节）。<br />诗篇：<br />我的灵魂切慕你，如鹿切慕溪水。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗42.1.htm">42:1</a>）<br />“鹿”在此表示对真理的情感；“切慕溪水”表示渴慕真理，“水”是指真理（参看<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>节）。<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />锡安女子的威荣全都失去；她的首领像找不着草场的鹿。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.6.htm">1:6</a>）<br />“锡安女子”表示对良善的情感，是属天教会所拥有的情感（<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）；“首领”表示该教会的首要真理（<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节），这些真理被比作“鹿”，以此表示对属世真理的情感；“找不着草场的鹿”表示没有真理及其良善的属世情感。“草场”表示维持人的属灵生命的真理和真理之良善（参看<a href="6078.htm">6078</a>，<a href="6277.htm">6277</a>节）。<br />耶利米书中的“母鹿”也是如此：<br />因为无雨降在地上，地都干裂；农夫蒙羞抱头，连母鹿在田野也刚生产就撇弃，因为无草。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.4.htm">14:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“母鹿”表示对属世良善的情感；“在田野生产”表示将属世情感与教会的属灵事物联结起来；然而，由于这些情感缺乏真理与良善，故经上说她“就撇弃，因为无草”。谁都能看出，此处关于母鹿所说的这些话有一个内义；因为若没有一个内义，那么此处“母鹿在田野也刚生产就撇弃，因为无草”又能表示什么呢？<br />在诗篇同样如此：<br />耶和华的声音使母鹿落胎，使森林也脱落净光；凡在祂殿中的，都说，荣耀。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.9.htm">29:9</a>）<br />“耶和华的声音使母鹿落胎”这句话里面有一个属灵的内义，这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来：经上紧接着又说“凡在祂殿中的，都说，荣耀”。若没有灵义，这些话与前面关于母鹿和森林所说的话连贯不起来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6413</b></p><p><b>6413.</b>
Is a hind let loose. That this signifies the freedom of natural affection, is evident from the signification of a "hind," as being natural affection (of which below); and from the signification of "let 
loose," as being freedom, for when a captured hind is let loose it has freedom. Deliverance from a state of temptations is compared to a "hind let loose," because the hind is an animal of the forest, 
loving freedom more than other animals, in which the natural also resembles it; for this loves to be in the delight of its affections, consequently in freedom, for freedom is that which belongs to 
affection. The reason why a "hind" signifies natural affection, is that it is one of the beasts which are significative of [good] affections, as are all those which are for food and use, such as lambs, 
sheep, goats, and kids, and also oxen, bullocks, and cows; but these beasts are also significative of spiritual affections, because burnt-offerings and sacrifices were made of them, whereas hinds, not 
being employed for such a use, were significative of natural affections. (That "beasts" signify affections may be seen above, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3519, 5198; 
also that their signifying affections is from the representatives in the world of spirits, n. 3218, 5198.) [2] Natural affections are also signified by "hinds" in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah maketh my 
feet like those of hinds, and stationeth me upon my high places (Ps. 18:33). And in Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     Jehovih the Lord is my strength, who setteth my feet like those of hinds, and maketh me to march upon 
my high places (Hab. 3:19).  "To make the feet like those of hinds" denotes the natural in the freedom of the affections (that "feet" are the natural, see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 
5327, 5328). That "to set the feet as those of hinds" has this signification, may be seen from the fact that to make the feet nimble and active to run like those of hinds is not anything spiritual; 
and yet that something spiritual is involved, is plain from what immediately follows, that "Jehovah will set him and cause him to march upon his high places," whereby is signified spiritual affection, 
which is above natural affection. So with this passage in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The lame shall leap as a hart (Isa. 35:6); </p>
<p>for by the "lame" is signified one who is in good, but not as yet genuine (n. 4302). [3] 
In David: </p>
<p>     As the hart crieth after the water brooks, so crieth my soul after Thee (Ps. 42:1); </p>
<p>the "hart" here is the affection of truth; "to cry after the water brooks" denotes to long 
for truths. (That "waters" are truths, see n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668.) [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Out of the daughter of Zion hath gone forth all her honor; her princes are become like harts, they 
have found no pasture (Lam. 1:6); </p>
<p>where the "daughter of Zion" denotes the affection of good, which affection is of the celestial church (n. 2362); "princes" denote the primary truths of that church 
(n. 1482, 2089, 5044), which are compared to "harts," whereby are signified the affections of natural truth; and by the "harts not finding pasture," are signified natural affections without truths and 
their goods. (That a "pasture" denotes truth and the good of truth, which sustain the spiritual life of man, see above, n. 6078, 6277.) [5] So by "hinds" in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The earth has been broken 
in pieces, in that there hath not been rain in the land, the husbandmen have been ashamed, they have covered over their heads, because even the hind hath brought forth in the field, but forsook it, because 
there was no grass (Jer. 14:4, 5); </p>
<p>the "hind" denotes the affection of natural good; "hath brought forth in the field" denotes to conjoin the natural affections with the spiritual things of the 
church; but because these affections were devoid of truths and goods, it is said that she "forsook, because there was no grass." Everyone can see that there is an internal sense in what is here said 
about the hind; for without an internal sense what could be here meant by the "hind bringing forth in the field, but forsaking, because there was no grass?"  [6] In like manner in David: </p>
<p>     The voice 
of Jehovah hath made the hinds to calve, and strippeth bare the forests; but in His temple everyone saith, Glory (Ps. 29:9); </p>
<p>that there is an internal sense which is spiritual in the words "the 
voice of Jehovah hath made the hinds to calve" is very evident from the fact that immediately afterward it is said, "but in His temple everyone saith, Glory," which words without the spiritual sense do 
not cohere with what is said before about hinds and forests. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6413</b></p><p><b>6413.</b>
'Is a hind let loose' means the freedom that natural affection possesses. This is clear from the meaning of 'a hind' as natural affection, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'let loose' as freedom, 
for when a hind that has been captured is let loose it has freedom. Freedom from a state of temptations is compared to 'a hind let loose' because a hind is a woodland creature that loves more than 
all others to be free. The natural too is like this, for it loves to engage in what delights its affections and therefore to feel free; for freedom is the hallmark of affection. The reason 'a hind' 
means natural affection is that it is one of the beasts that serve to mean the affections, all of which beasts can be used as food and are useful creatures, such as lambs, sheep, she-goats, kids, he-goats, 
as well as bulls, young bulls, and also cows. Yet these beasts also serve to mean spiritual affections because burnt offerings and sacrifices were made of them, whereas 'hinds', because they were 
not put to that use, served to mean natural affections. For 'beasts' and their meaning affections, see <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>, <a href="719.htm">719</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>; and the fact that their 
meaning affections has its origin in representatives in the world of spirits, <a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="5850.htm">5850</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Natural affections are also meant by 'hinds' in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah makes my feet like those of hinds, 
and sets me on my high places. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovih the Lord is my strength, who places my feet like those of hinds, and causes me to walk on my high places. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Placing 
feet like those of hinds' stands for the natural when its affections are in freedom, 'feet' being the natural, see <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>. This meaning of 'placing feet 
like those of hinds may be seen from the fact there is nothing spiritual about making a person's feet like those of hinds, nimble and fit to run with. Yet the idea does have a spiritual implication, 
as is evident from the references that immediately follow to being set by Jehovah on high places and caused to walk on them, meaning spiritual affection on a level above natural affection. The same applies 
to the following words in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The lame man will leap like a hart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2035:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 35:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The lame man' means a person who is governed by good, though not as yet by genuine good, <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In 
David, </p>
<blockquote>
As the hart cries out for the water brooks,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so does my soul cry out for You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2042:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 42:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the hart' stands for the affection for truth, 'crying out for the water brooks' for desiring 
truths, 'waters' being truths, see <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
There has gone out from the daughter of Zion all her majesty; her princes have become like harts, they have not 
found pasture. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%201:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 1:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The daughter of Zion' stands for the affection for good, the affection the celestial Church has, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. 'Princes stands for the first and foremost truths of that Church, <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>, which truths are compared to 'harts', by which affections for natural truth are meant. And by harts that 'have not found pasture' are meant natural affections devoid of truths and forms 
of good that go with them, 'pasture' being truth and the good of truth that sustain a person's spiritual life, see <a href="6078.htm">6078</a>, <a href="6277.htm">6277</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'Hinds' is used in a similar way in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>The land was broken 
up in pieces because no rain had come to be on the land; the farmers were put to shame, they covered their heads, because even the hind in the field calved but left because there was no grass. Jer. 
14:4, <a href="5.htm">5</a>. </p>
<p>'The hind' stands for an affection for natural good, 'calved in the field' for joining natural affections to spiritual ones which exist in the Church. Yet because those affections were 
devoid of truths and forms of good, it says that she left the field because there was no grass. Anyone can see that these things said about the hind have an inner meaning, for without it what point would 
there be in saying that the hind in the field calved but left because there was no grass? </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The same is so with what is said in David, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of Jehovah causes the hinds to calve, and 
strips the forests bare; but in His temple everyone says, Glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2029:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 29:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The existence of an inner meaning, which is the spiritual sense, within the statement that 'the voice of Jehovah causes the 
hinds to calve' is perfectly clear from the fact that immediately afterwards it says, 'but in His temple everyone says, Glory'. Without the spiritual sense these words do not hang together with the 
statement before them about hinds and forests.

`Cerva dimissa': quod significet liberum affectionis naturalis, constat ex significatione `cervae' quod sit affectio naturalis, de qua sequitur; et a significatione `dimissa' quod sit liberum, nam cum 
cerva capta dimittitur, tunc ei liberum; liberatio a statu tentationum comparatur `cervae dimissae' quia cerva est animal silvestre, libertatem prae reliquis amans, cui simile etiam est naturale, nam 
hoc in jucundo affectionum suarum amat esse, proinde in libero, nam liberum est quod est affectionis.  Quod per `cervam' significetur affectio naturalis, est quia est inter bestias significativas affectionum, 
quae sunt omnes quae pro cibo sunt ac utiles, sicut agni, oves, caprae, haedi, hirci, tum boves, juvenci, et quoque vaccae, sed hae bestiae sunt etiam significativae affectionum spiritualium, 
quia ab illis holocausta et sacrificia fiebant, (x)cervae autem quia non ad talem usum adhibebantur, significativae erant affectionum naturalium; quod `bestiae' significent affectiones, videatur n. 
45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3519, 5198; et quod significent affectiones, sit ex repraesentativis in mundo spirituum, n. 3218, 5850. [2] Affectiones naturales per cervas 
etiam significantur apud Davidem, Jehovah similes facit pedes meos sicut cervarum, et super  excelsis meis collocat me, Ps. xviii 34 (A. V. 33): </p>
<p>et apud Habakkuk, Jehovih Dominus fortitudo mea, 
Qui ponit pedes meos sicut cervarum, et super excelsis meis incedere facit me, iii 19;  ponere pedes sicut cervarum pro naturale in libertate affectionum; quod `pedes' sint naturale, videatur n. 2162, 
3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328; quod `ponere pedes sicut cervarum' id sit, constare potest ex eo quod {1}facere pedes sicut cervarum agiles et ad currendum habiles non aliquid spirituale 
sit, quod autem spirituale involvat, patet ibi a mox sequentibus quod `Jehovah super excelsis collocet et incedere faciat'; per quae significatur affectio spiritualis quae supra naturalem est; similiter 
se habet cum hoc apud Esaiam, {2}Saliet sicut cervus claudus, xxxv 6; </p>
<p>per `claudum' enim significatur qui in bono sed non adhuc genuino, 4302: [3] apud Davidem,  Sicut cervus vociferatur super

`cervi non invenerunt pascuum' affectiones naturales absque veris et horum bonis; quod `pascuum' sit verum et veri bonum quae sustentant vitam hominis spiritualem, videatur n. 6078,6277:  [5] similiter 
per `cervas' apud Jeremiam,   Terra confracta est, quod non facta sit pluvia in terra,  pudefacti sunt agricolae, obtexerunt caput suum, quia etiam  cerva in agro peperit, sed relinquendo, quia
