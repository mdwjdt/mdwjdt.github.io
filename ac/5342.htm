<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5342节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5342.</strong>“把粮食存放在各城里”表它将它们（即与良善联结的真理）储存在内层。这从“存放”、“粮食”和“各城”的含义清楚可知：“存放”是指储存；“粮食”是指与良善联结的真理，如刚才所述（<a href="5340.htm">5340</a>节）；“各城”是指属世心智的内层，如前所述（<a href="5297.htm">5297</a>节）。与良善联结的真理被储存在属世心智的内层，在那里被保存起来，以备之后的生活所用，尤其是为了人重生期间的试探所用。这个观念是一个如今很少有人知道的奥秘，故有必要说一说这个奥秘的性质。因为“七年丰收”表示最初增多的真理，“粮食”存放在各城和“城中”表示与良善联结的这些真理被储存在人的内层。七年的饥荒和随后靠由所聚敛的那一捆捆提供的维持表示通过与良善联结并被储存在内层中的真理所实现的重生状态。<br />这个奥秘是这样：从最早的婴儿期直到童年早期，人就被主引入天堂；事实上，他被置于属天天使中间，属天天使将他保持在纯真状态。婴幼儿直到童年早期所经历的这种状态是众所周知的。当童年开始时，孩子逐渐褪去纯真的状态；但即便如此，他仍通过他与其同伴对彼此所感觉到的仁爱情感而被保持在仁爱的状态。对许多人来说，这种状态会持续到青春期；在此期间，他在属灵天使中间。此时他开始出于自己里面的东西思考，并照此行事，故无法再像以前那样被保持在仁爱中；因为现在他将遗传之恶召唤出来，让它们来引导自己。一旦这种状态到来，他以前所获得的仁爱与纯真的良善就照着他思想邪恶并通过行为强化它们的程度而被驱逐。其实它们并未被驱逐，只是被主撤回到内层并在那里被储存起来。<br />但由于他还不认识真理，故他在之前的两种状态下所获得的纯真与仁爱的良善尚不具备任何品质；因为真理赋予良善品质，而良善则赋予真理本质。因此，自这个年龄起，他就通过所接受的教导，尤其通过他自己对这些真理的思考和随之的验证而装备真理。这时，他越处于对良善的情感，主就越在他里面将真理与良善联结起来（参看<a href="5340.htm">5340</a>节），并将它们储存起来以备将来所用。这就是“七个丰年或七年丰收”所表示的状态。从严格意义上说，被称为“余剩”的，正是这些与良善联结的真理。所以，人在何等程度上让自己重生，余剩就在何等程度上为功用服务；因为主在同等程度上动用余剩的贮存，把它们送回属世层，以便产生外层与内层，或属世之物与属灵之物的一种对应关系；这一切就在“七个荒年或七年饥荒”所表示的状态下发生。这是奥秘。<br />如今教会成员以为，无论人的生活如何，他都能凭怜悯或恩典被接入天堂，在那里享受永恒的幸福；因为教会成员以为，这只是被允许进入的问题。但他大错特错了，因为若不获得属灵的生命或生活，没有人可以进入天堂，在那里得蒙悦纳；若不重生，没有人能获得属灵的生命或生活；若不藉着与教义真理结合的生活良善，没有人能重生。这就是他获得属灵生命或生活的方式。若不通过重生获得属灵生命或生活，没有人能进入天堂，主在约翰福音中明确指出了这一事实：<br />我实实在在地告诉你：人若不重生，就不能见神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.3.htm">3:3</a>）<br />然后祂又说：<br />我实实在在地告诉你：人若不是从水与灵生的，就不能进神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.5.htm">3:5</a>）<br />“水”是指教义的真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>节），“灵”是指生活的良善。没有人单凭受洗进入这国；确切地说，洗礼是表示教会成员应当牢记在心的重生之标志。</p>

And put the food in the cities. That this signifies that he stored it up in the interiors, namely, truths adjoined to good, is evident from the signification here of "putting," as being to store up; 
from the signification of "food," as being truth adjoined to good (of which just above, n. 4340); and from the signification of "cities," as being the interiors of the natural mind (of which also above, 
n. 5297). That truths adjoined to good are stored up in the interiors of the natural mind, and there preserved for use in after life, especially for use in temptations during man's regeneration, is 
a secret known to few at this day; and therefore something must be said about this. For by the "seven years of abundance of produce" are signified the truths first multiplied, and by the corn being "put 
in the cities" and "in the midst" is signified that these truths adjoined to good are stored up in man's interiors: and by the "seven years of famine," and by the sustenance at that time from the 
gatherings, is signified a state of regeneration through truths adjoined to good, stored up in the interiors. [2] The secret is this: from earliest infancy even to the first of childhood, man is being 
introduced by the Lord into heaven, and indeed among celestial angels, by whom he is kept in a state of innocence; a state in which (as is known) infants are up to the first of childhood. When the age 
of childhood begins, the child gradually puts off the state of innocence, though he is still kept in a state of charity by means of the affection of mutual charity toward those like himself, which 
state with many continues up to youth, and meanwhile he is among spiritual angels. Then, because he begins to think from himself and to act accordingly, he can no longer be kept in charity as before; 
for he then calls forth inherited evils, by which he suffers himself to be led. When this state comes, the goods of charity and innocence that he had previously received, are banished according to the 
degree in which he thinks evils and confirms them by act; and yet they are not banished, but are withdrawn by the Lord toward the interiors and there stored up.  [3] But as he does not yet know truths, 
the goods of innocence and charity he had received in the two preceding states have not yet been qualified, for truths give quality to good, and good gives essence to truths; wherefore from this age 
he is imbued with truths by instruction, and especially by means of his own thoughts and confirmations from them. Insofar therefore as he is then in the affection of good, so far truths are conjoined 
with good in him by the Lord (see n. 5340), and are stored up for use. This state is what is signified by the "seven years of abundance of produce." It is these truths adjoined to good that in the 
proper sense are called "remains." Insofar therefore as the man suffers himself to be regenerated, so far the remains serve for use; for so far a supply from them is drawn forth by the Lord, and is sent 
back into the natural, in order to produce a correspondence of the exteriors with the interiors, or of what is natural with what is spiritual; and this is effected in the state signified by the "seven 
years of famine." Such is the secret. [4] The man of the church at this day believes that no matter what anyone's life is, he may of mercy be received into heaven, and there enjoy eternal bliss; 
for he supposes admission to be all that is necessary. But he is much mistaken, for no one can be admitted and received into heaven unless he has received spiritual life, and no one can receive spiritual 
life unless he is being regenerated, and no one can be regenerated except through the good of life conjoined with the truth of doctrine: from this he has spiritual life. That no one can come into 
heaven unless he has received spiritual life through regeneration, the Lord plainly declares in John: </p>
<p>	Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the Kingdom of God (John 
3:3); </p>
<p>and then He says: </p>
<p>	Verily, verily I say to thee, Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5); </p>
<p>"water" is the truth of doctrine (n. 2702, 
3058, 3424, 4976), and "spirit" is the good of life. No one enters by baptism; but baptism is significative of that regeneration which the man of the church ought to keep in mind. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5342</b></p><p><b>5342.</b>
'And laid up food in the cities' means that it stored them - truths linked to good - in the interior parts. This is clear from the meaning here of 'laying up' as storing; from the meaning of 'food' as 
truth linked to good, dealt with just above in <a href="5340.htm">5340</a>; and from the meaning of 'the cities' as the interior parts of the natural mind, dealt with above in <a href="5297.htm">5297</a>. The idea that truths linked to good are 
stored in the interior parts of the natural mind, and are preserved there for use subsequently in life, in particular for use in temptations when a person is being regenerated, is an arcanum known to 
few at the present day. Therefore the nature of this arcanum must be stated. The seven years of abundance of corn mean the truths multiplied initially, and the storage of grain in the cities, in the 
midst of them, means that those truths linked to good were stored away in a person's interior parts. The seven years of famine and the sustainment provided by the bunches that had been gathered means 
the state of regeneration effected by means of the truths that had been linked to good and stored away in the interior parts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The arcanum is this: During the time from earliest infancy through 
to early childhood a person is led by the Lord into heaven; indeed he is placed among celestial angels who serve to keep him in a state of innocence. This state which infants pass through until early 
childhood is a well-known one. At the beginning of childhood a gradual shedding of that state of innocence takes place; but even so, the person is kept in a state of charity through the charitable affection 
which he and his companions feel for one another. During this state, which with many people lasts through to adolescence, he is among spiritual angels. Because he begins at this time to think from 
what is within himself and to act in accordance with this, he cannot be kept any longer in charity, as he was previously; for now he calls on hereditary evils and allows them to lead him. Once this 
state has arrived the forms of the good of charity and innocence adopted by him previously are banished, to the extent that forms of evil are present in his thinking and are reinforced by his actions. 
Actually those forms of good are not banished but are withdrawn by the Lord to interior parts where they are stored away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But because he does not as yet know any truths, those forms of the good 
of innocence and charity which he has adopted during those two states do not possess any qualities as yet; for truths give good its qualities, while good gives truths their essence. From this time 
of life onwards therefore he is being equipped with truths by means of the teaching he receives, and especially by means of his own thoughts about and consequent verification of those truths. Insofar 
as he is moved at this time by an affection for good, the Lord joins truths to good in him, <a href="5340.htm">5340</a>, and stores them away for [future] use. This is the state that is meant by the seven years of abundance 
of corn. These truths linked to good are the ones which in a proper sense are called remnants. In the measure therefore that a person allows himself to be regenerated, the remnants serve a useful purpose; 
for the Lord draws in the same measure on that store of remnants and returns them to the natural. As a result a correspondence of exterior things with interior ones, or natural things with spiritual 
ones, is brought about; and this happens in the state that is meant by 'the seven years of famine'. This is the arcanum. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 At the present day the member of the Church thinks that no matter 
what anyone's life is like he can nevertheless by an act of mercy be accepted into heaven and enjoy eternal blessedness there; for the member of the Church imagines that it is simply a matter of being 
let in. But he is much mistaken, because no one can be let into heaven and find acceptance there unless he has acquired spiritual life, and no one can acquire spiritual life unless he is being regenerated, 
and no one can undergo regeneration except by means of goodness of life coupled to truth taught by doctrine. This is the way spiritual life is acquired by him. The fact that no one can enter heaven 
unless he has acquired spiritual life through regeneration is stated plainly by the Lord in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Truly, truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And just after this, </p>
<blockquote>
Truly, truly I say to you, Unless a person has been born from water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:5</a>.

<p>'Water' is the truth taught by doctrine, 
<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, and 'the spirit' is goodness of life. No one enters the kingdom simply through being baptized; rather, baptism is the sign denoting regeneration which the member of the Church 
should call to mind. </p>

`Et dedit cibum in urbibus': quod significet quod reposuerit in interioribus nempe {1}vera bono adjuncta, constat ex significatione `dare' hic quod sit reponere; a significatione `cibi' quod sit verum 
bono adjunctum, de qua mox supra n. (x)5340; et a significatione `urbium' quod sint interiora mentis naturalis, de qua supra n. 5297. Quod vera bono adjuncta reponantur in interioribus mentis naturalis, 
et ibi {2} ad usum sequentis vitae conserventur, imprimis ad usum in tentationibus quando regeneratur homo, est arcanum quod pauci hodie sciunt, quare dicendum quomodo se habet: per `septem enim 
annos abundantiae annonae' significantur vera primum multiplicata, et per `quod in urbibus et in medio repositum sit frumentum' significatur quod vera illa bono adjuncta recondita sint in interioribus 
hominis; et per `septem annos famis' (c)ac per sustentationem tunc a collectionibus' significatur status regenerationis per vera bono adjuncta in interioribus recondita; [2] arcanum hoc est: homo a 
prima infantia usque ad primam pueritiam introducitur a Domino in caelum, et quidem inter angelos caelestes per quos tenetur in statu innocentiae, qui status quod sit infantibus usque ad primum pueritiae, 
notum est; cum aetas pueritiae incipit, tunc per gradus exuit statum innocentiae, at usque tenetur in statu charitatis per affectionem charitatis mutuae erga similes sui, qui status apud plures perseverat 
usque ad adolescentiam; (t)est tunc ille inter angelos spirituales; tunc quia incipit (a) se cogitare, et secundum id agere, non amplius teneri potest in charitate, ut prius, hereditaria enim 
mala tunc evocat, a quibus se duci patitur; cum hic status venit, tunc bona charitatis et innocentiae quae prius acceperat, secundum gradus sicut cogitat mala et actu confirmat illa, exterminantur, 
{3}at usque non exterminantur sed versus interiora a Domino deducuntur et ibi reconduntur; [3] sed quia nondum vera novit, ideo bona innocentiae et charitatis quae acceperat in binis illis statibus, nondum 
qualificata sunt, vera enim dant qualitatem bono, et bonum dat essentiam veris, idcirco ab illa aetate per instructiones, et imprimis per proprias cogitationes et inde confirmationes, imbuitur veris; 
quantum itaque tunc in affectione boni est, tantum conjunguntur a Domino vera bono apud illum, n. (x)5340, et reconduntur ad usus; hic status est qui significatur per `septem annos abundantiae annonae'; 
vera illa {4}bono adjuncta sunt quae in proprio sensu vocantur reliquiae; quantum itaque homo patitur se regenerari, tantum reliquiae inserviunt usui, nam tantum ex illis a Domino depromitur, 
et in naturale remittitur, ut producatur correspondentia exteriorum cum interioribus, seu naturalium cum spiritualibus; hoc fit in statu qui significatur per `septem annos famis'; hoc est arcanum. [4] 
Homo Ecclesiae credit hodie quod qualiscumque alicui vita sit, usque ex misericordia in caelum recipi queat et ibi beatitudine aeterna frui, putat enim quod solum sit admissio; sed multum fallitur, 
nemo enim in caelum admitti et recipi potest nisi acceperit vitam spiritualem, et nemo vitam spiritualem accipere potest nisi regeneretur, et nemo regenerari potest nisi per bonum vitae conjunctum vero 
doctrinae; inde ei vita spiritualis; quod nemo in caelum venire possit nisi acceperit vitam spiritualem per regenerationem, manifeste dicit Dominus apud Johannem,  Amen, amen dico tibi, Nisi quis generetur
