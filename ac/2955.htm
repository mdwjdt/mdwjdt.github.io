<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2955节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2955.</strong>“我就在那里埋葬我的死人”表他们以这种方式摆脱黑夜并被复活。这从前面所解释的“埋葬”和“死人”的含义（<a href="2917.htm">2917</a>，<a href="2923.htm">2923</a>，<a href="2925.htm">2925</a>，<a href="2931.htm">2931</a>，<a href="2948.htm">2948</a>节）清楚可知。此处之所以说他们被复活，是因为他们处在接受信的过程中。他们通过信，也就是说，通过作为信之果实的良善接受生命；其生命并没有其它源头。“我就埋葬我的死人”表示摆脱属灵的黑夜并被复活的另外一个原因是，一旦前教会死去，主就会建立一个新教会以取而代之，生命因此被赐下，以取代死亡，黎明则取代黑夜到来。还有一个原因是，对于正被改造并变得属灵之人而言，他的“死”可以说就是埋葬，于是新的、被复活的东西便兴起。因此，取代他的黑夜，也就是黑暗与寒冷的是：黎明破晓，并带来它的光与热。正因如此，拥有主的生命在里面的天使想到的是复活和新的生命，以取代世人埋葬死人的观念。这也是事实，因为地上总有某个教会。当旧教会气绝，黑夜降临时，一个新教会就在某个地方兴起，黎明便破晓而出。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2955</b></p><p><b>2955.</b>
I will bury my dead. That this signifies that they would come forth from night and be vivified, is evident from the signification of being "buried," and of "dead," as given above (n. 2917, 2923, 2925, 
2931, 2948). They are here said to be vivified, because they are in the course of receiving faith; for from faith, that is, from its good, they receive life; their life is from no other source. That 
"I will bury my dead" signifies emerging from spiritual night and being vivified, is also for the reason that when a former church is dead, a new one is raised up by the Lord in its place; thus life 
is given in place of death, and in place of night there comes morning; and also for the reason that with everyone who is being reformed and is becoming spiritual, his "dead" is as it were buried, and 
that which is new, which is living, rises again: thus in place of night with him, or in place of darkness and cold, there arises morning with its light and its heat. Hence it is that the angels, who are 
in the Lord's life, in place of man's idea about the burial of the dead, have an idea of resurrection and of new life. And this also is the case, for there is always some church on the earth; and when 
the old expires, and night comes on, then a new church arises elsewhere and there comes morning. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2955</b></p><p><b>2955.</b>
'I will bury my dead' means that they would emerge from night and be made alive. This is clear from the meaning of 'burying' and of 'one who is dead', dealt with above in <a href="2917.htm">2917</a>, <a href="2923.htm">2923</a>, <a href="2925.htm">2925</a>, <a href="2931.htm">2931</a>, <a href="2948.htm">2948</a>. 
They are spoken of here as being made alive because they are on their way to receiving faith; for it is from faith, that is to say, from the good that is the fruit of it, that they receive life. That 
life has no other source. A further reason why 'I will bury my dead' means emerging from spiritual night and being made alive is that once the previous Church has died, a new one is established by the 
Lord to take its place, and so life is imparted to take the place of death, and morning to take the place of night. And there is the further reason still that with everyone who is being reformed and 
becoming spiritual, that which has died in him is so to speak buried, and that which is new and made alive rises up, so that instead of the night with him, that is, instead of darkness and cold, morning 
breaks, bringing its light and warmth. This explains why with angels, who have the Lord's life in them, in place of men's idea of burial of the dead there is the idea of resurrection and of new life. 
This is indeed so, for some Church always exists on earth, and when the old Church breathes its last and night has fallen, a new one rises up somewhere else, and morning breaks. </p>

</p><b>2955.</b>
Quod `sepeliam mortuum meum' significet quod e nocte emergerent et vivificarentur, constat a significatione `sepeliri, et mortui,' de qua supra n. 2917, 2923, 2925, 2931, 2948; hic vivificari dicuntur 
quia in progressione recipiendi fidem sunt; ex fide enim, nempe ex ejus bono, accipiunt vitam, aliunde non est vita.  Quod `sepeliam mortuum meum' significet emersionem a nocte spirituali et vivificationem, 
etiam inde est quia prior Ecclesia cum mortua, nova loco ejus exsuscitatur a Domino, ita loco mortis datur vita, {1}et loco noctis fit mane; etiam inde quod apud unumquemvis qui reformatur et 
fit spiritualis, mortuum ejus quasi sepeliatur, et novum quod est vivum, resurgat, ita loco noctis apud illum, seu loco tenebrarum et frigoris, exsurgit mane cum sua luce et suo calore; inde est quod 
apud angelos qui in vita Domini sunt, loco ideae {2}apud hominem de sepultura mortui, sit idea resurrectionis et novae vitae.  Ita quoque se habet, nam semper aliqua Ecclesia est in tellure, et cum 
vetus exspirat et fit nox, tunc nova alibi resurgit, et fit mane. @1 seu$  @2 de sepultura mortui quae apud hominem$  </p>
