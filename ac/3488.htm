<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3488节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3488.</strong>主所说并记录在福音书中的这些话描述了教会堕落的第二个状态。这一事实从它们的内义明显看出来，其内义如下：<br />“这一切事却只是灾难的起头”表早就已经发生的事，也就是说，属教会堕落的最初状态的事。如前所述，当人们开始不再知道何为良善，何为真理，并就此彼此争论，由此导致虚假、因而异端产生时，这些事就会发生。这种事在许多世纪以前就败坏了教会，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：基督教界的教会四分五裂，这种分裂就是由良善与真理的观点造成的；因此，教会在很久以前就开始堕落了。<br />“那时，他们必将你们送交苦难中，杀害你们”表良善与真理将消失不见，先是通过“苦难”，也就是堕落，然后通过人们“杀害他们”，也就是否认。当论及良善与真理时，“杀害”是指不接受，因而是指否认（参看<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>节）。“你们”，即使徒，表示作为一个整体的信的一切事物，因而表示信之良善与信之真理。因为十二使徒就是指这些事物（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>节）。他们具有这种含义在此是显而易见的，因为所论述的主题不是使徒传道，而是世代的末了。<br />“你们必为我的名被万族恨恶”表对关乎良善与真理的一切事物的蔑视和憎恶。“恨恶”是指蔑视和憎恶，因为这些是恨恶的表现。“万族”表那些处于邪恶的人，因为“民族”就是指这类人（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>，<a href="1868.htm">1868</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）。“为我的名”是指为了主，因而为了出自祂的一切事物。“主的名”是指藉以敬拜祂的作为一个整体的一切事物，因而是指属于其教会的一切事物（参看<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>节）。<br />“那时，必有许多人跌倒，也要彼此陷害，彼此恨恶”表由于这些事而产生的敌意。“必有许多人跌倒”表敌意本身，主的人性本身就是那敌意所攻击的。圣言各处已经预言，这将是犯罪的原因或绊脚石。“彼此陷害”表由虚假与真理的冲突所产生的彼此间的敌意。“彼此恨恶”表由邪恶与良善的冲突所产生的彼此间的敌意。<br />“且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人”表虚假的说教，“假先知”是指那些教导虚假，因而教导虚假教义的人（参看<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>节）。“迷惑多人”表将来会有一些事，就是这个教义的问题。<br />“只因不法的事增多，许多人的爱心才渐渐冷淡了”表仁连同信的气绝。“只因不法的事增多”表与信之虚假同步。“许多人的爱心才渐渐冷淡了”表仁爱的气绝，因为这二者，就是仁与信齐头并进。哪里没有信，哪里就没有仁，哪里没有仁，哪里就没有信。然而，接受信的是仁，仁的缺乏会拒绝信。这就是一切虚假和一切邪恶的根源。<br />“惟有忍耐到底的必然得救”表那些拥有仁爱之人的得救。“忍耐到底”是指不让自己误入歧途，从而在试探中屈服的人。<br />“这天国的福音要传遍整个可居之地，对万族作见证”表这必先在基督教界为人所知。“传遍”表广为人知。“这天国的福音”是指这样的真理，即它的确如此。“福音”表宣告，“国”表真理，因为“国”表示真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>节）。“整个可居之地”表基督教界，“地”是指教会所在的地区，因而是指基督教界（参看<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>节）。此处教会因信之生命，就是居于真理中的良善而被称为“可居的”，因为就内义而言，“居”是指生活，“居民”是指居于真理的良善（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>节）。“作见证”表确保他们知道，防止他们假装不知道。“对万族”表对邪恶（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>，<a href="1868.htm">1868</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）。因为当人们处于虚假和邪恶时，他们就不再知道何为真理，何为良善；事实上，他们视假为真，视恶为善，反之亦然。当教会处于这种状态时，“然后末期才来到”。蒙主的神圣怜悯，接下来的经文将在下一章的序言中予以解释，这些经文论述了被称为“毁坏可憎的”教会的状态，也就是第三个状态。</p>

That the second state of the perversion of the church was described by the foregoing words of the Lord in the evangelist, is evident from their internal sense, which is as follows: </p>
<p>     All these things 
are the beginning of sorrows; </p>
<p>signifies those things which precede-that is, which are of the first state of the perversion of the church-which as before said is that they would begin no longer to 
know what is good and what is true, but would dispute about it among themselves, from which would arise falsities, and therefore heresies. That such things perverted the church before many centuries 
had elapsed, is evident from the fact that the church in the Christian world was divided, and this according to opinions concerning good and truth; thus that the perversion of the church commenced long 
ago.      [2] Then shall they deliver you into tribulation, and shall kill you; </p>
<p>signifies that good and truth would perish, first by "tribulation," that is, by perversion; afterwards by their "killing" 
them, that is, by denial. (That to "kill," when predicated of good and truth, is not to receive, thus is to deny, may be seen above, n. 3387, 3395.) By "you," that is, by the apostles, are signified 
all things of faith in one complex, thus its good as well as its truth. That these things are signified by the twelve apostles may be seen above (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3354) and here the 
same is clearly evident; for it is not the preaching of the apostles that is treated of, but the consummation of the age.      [3] And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake; </p>
<p>signifies 
contempt and aversion for all things which are of good and truth; "to hate" is to despise and hold in aversion, for this is of hatred; "of all nations" signifies by those who are in evil (that such 
are meant by "nations" may be seen above, n. 1259, 1260, 1849, 1868, 2588); "for My name's sake" is on account of the Lord, thus on account of all things which are from Him (that the Lord's "name" is 
everything in one complex by which He is worshiped, thus everything which is of His church, may be seen above, n. 2724, 3006).      [4] And then shall many be offended, and shall deliver up one another, 
and shall hate one another; </p>
<p>signifies enmities on account of these things; "many shall be offended" denotes enmity in itself; the Human itself of the Lord is that against which there is enmity; 
that this would be an offense and a stumbling-block is here and there predicted in the Word; "they shall deliver up one another" denotes enmity among themselves from falsity against truth; "and shall 
hate one another" denotes enmity among themselves from evil against good.      [5] And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray; </p>
<p>signifies preachings of falsity (that "false prophets" 
are those who teach falsities, thus false doctrine, may be seen above, n. 2534) "and shall lead many astray" denotes that there should be derivations therefrom.      [6] And because iniquity shall 
be multiplied, the charity of many shall wax cold; </p>
<p>signifies the expiring of charity together with faith; "because iniquity shall be multiplied" denotes according to the falsities of faith; "the charity 
of many shall wax cold" denotes the expiring of charity, for they keep pace together; where faith is not, there charity is not, and where charity is not, faith is not; but charity is that which 
receives faith, and no charity is that which rejects faith: this is the origin of every falsity and every evil.      [7] But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved; </p>
<p>signifies the salvation 
of those who are in charity; "he that endureth to the end" is he who does not suffer himself to be led astray, thus who does not succumb in temptations.      [8] And this gospel of the kingdom 
shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth, for a testimony unto all nations; </p>
<p>signifies that this should first become known in the Christian world; "shall be preached" denotes that it should be made 
known; "this gospel of the kingdom" is this truth that it is so; "gospel" denotes the annunciation; "kingdom" denotes truth (that "kingdom" denotes truth may be seen above, n. 1672, 2547); "in the 
whole inhabited earth" denotes the Christian world (that "earth" is the region where the church is, thus the Christian world, may be seen above, n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 
3355). The church here is called "inhabited" from the life of faith, that is, from the good which is of truth; for in the internal sense "to inhabit" denotes to live; and the "inhabitants" are the goods 
of truth (n. 1293, 2268, 2451, 2712, 3384); "for a testimony" denotes that they may know, and not make a pretext that they have been ignorant; "to all nations" denotes to evils (n. 1259, 1260, 1849, 
1868, 2588); for when they are in falsity and evil, they no longer know what is true and what is good; they then believe falsity to be truth, and evil to be good, and the reverse; and when the church 
is in this state, "then shall the end come." In what now follows and what of the Lord's Divine mercy will be unfolded prefatory to the next chapter of Genesis, that state of the church is treated 
of which is called the "abomination of desolation," which is the third state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3488</b></p><p><b>3488.</b>
The fact that these words spoken by the Lord and recorded in the gospel describe the second state of the perversion of the Church is evident from their internal sense, which is as follows, </p>
<p>All these 
are the beginning of sorrows means the things that have already happened, that is to say, the things that belong to the first state of the perversion of the Church, which, as has been stated, takes 
place when people cease to know any longer what goodness is and what truth is and start to argue with one another about them, with the result that falsities, and consequently heresies arise. The fact 
that such things perverted the Church before very many centuries had gone by is evident from the consideration that the Church in the Christian world became divided, and that its divisions were the result 
of opinions concerning goodness and truth; so that the Church began to be perverted a long way back in the past. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 At that time they will deliver you up to affliction, and will kill you means 
that goodness and truth will perish, at first through 'affliction'- that is, through perversion - and then through men 'killing' them, that is, through denial. For 'killing', when used in reference 
to goodness and truth, means that these are not being accepted, and thus that people deny them, see <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>. 'You' - the apostles - means all things of faith in their entirety, and so means the good 
of faith as well as the truth of faith; for the twelve apostles meant those things, see <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>. Here it is quite evident that they have that meaning, for the subject 
is not the preaching of the apostles but the close of the age. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake means contempt for and loathing of everything to do with goodness and truth. 
'Hating' is holding in contempt and loathing, for these are manifestations of hatred. 'By all nations' means by persons under the influence of evil, for 'nations' refers to these, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>, <a href="1868.htm">1868</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a> (end). 'For My name's sake' is for the Lord's sake, and so for the sake of everything that comes from Him - 'the Lord's name' being everything in its entirety by which He is worshipped, 
and so everything belonging to His Church, see <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 At that time many will stumble, and betray one another, and hate one another means hostility on account of those things. 'Many will 
stumble' means the hostility in itself - the Lord's Human being that against which the hostility is directed. That this will be a cause of offence or a stumbling-block is foretold in various places 
in the Word. 'Betray one another' is hostility towards one another arising out of falsity conflicting with truth. 'And hate one another' is hostility towards one another arising out of evil conflicting 
with good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray means declarations of falsity - 'false prophets' meaning teachers of falsities, thus false doctrine, see <a href="2534.htm">2534</a>. 'And will 
lead many astray' means that there will be things that are the issue of that doctrine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 And because iniquity is multiplied the charity of many will grow cold means charity together with faith 
breathing its last. 'Because iniquity is multiplied' means in keeping with falsities of faith. 'The charity of many will grow cold' means charity breathing its last; for the two - charity and faith - 
go together side by side. Where there is no faith there is no charity; and where there is no charity there is no faith. Charity however is that which receives faith, and the absence of charity is that 
which rejects faith. This is the origin of all falsity and of all evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 But he who endures to the end will be saved means the salvation of those who have charity. 'He who endures to the end' is 
the person who does not allow himself to be led astray, and so does not yield in times of temptation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth as a testimony 
to all nations means that the Christian world wilt be the first to come to know it. 'Will be preached' means that it will come to be known. 'This gospel of the kingdom' is this truth, that it really 
is so - 'gospel' being pronouncement, 'the kingdom' truth, for 'the kingdom' means truth, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>. 'In the whole inhabited earth' is the Christian world, 'the earth' being that region where the 
Church, and so the Christian world, is, see <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>. Here the Church is called 'the inhabited earth' from the life of faith, that is, from the good 
that dwells in truth, for 'inhabiting' in the internal sense is living, and 'inhabitants' are the goods that dwell in truth, <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>. 'As a testimony' means to ensure that they know, 
and to prevent them pretending that they do not know. 'To all nations' means to the evil, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>, <a href="1868.htm">1868</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a>. For when people are under the influence of falsity and evil they no longer 
know what truth is or what good is; indeed they believe that falsity is truth, that evil is good, and vice versa. When the Church reaches this state, at that point the end will come. The words that follow 
next, to be explained in the Lord's Divine mercy in the preliminary section of the next chapter of Genesis, deal with that state of the Church which is called 'the abomination of desolation', which 
is the third state. </p>

Quod secundus status perversionis Ecclesiae per illa verba Domini apud Evangelistam descriptus sit, patet a sensu interno eorundem, qui talis est: `Omnia haec initium dolorum' significant illa quae 
praecedunt, nempe quae status primi perversionis Ecclesiae sunt, qui est, ut dictum, quod non amplius inciperent scire quid bonum et quid verum, sed de illis litigarent inter se, a quibus falsitates, 
proinde haereses; quod talia Ecclesiam ante plura saecula perverterint, patet inde quod Ecclesia in Christiano orbe divisa sit, et hoc secundum opiniones de bono et vero, ita quod perversio Ecclesiae 
{1}a multo tempore retro incepta sit.  [2] `Tunc tradent vos in tribulationem, et occident vos' significat quod bonum et verum periturum sit, primum per `tribulationem,' quod est, per perversionem; dein 
per quod `occident' illa, quod est, per negationem; quod `occidere' cum praedicatur de bono et vero sit non recipi, ita negare, videatur n. 3387, 3395; per `vos' seu per apostolos significantur omnia 
fidei in uno complexu, ita tam bonum ejus quam verum; quod per duodecim apostolos illa significata sint, videatur n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130 f., 3272, 3354, et hic manifeste patet, {2}non enim de apostolorum 
praedicatione sed de consummatione saeculi agitur. [3] `Et eritis odio habiti ab omnibus gentibus propter nomen Meum significat contemptum et aversionem pro omnibus quae sunt boni et veri; `odio 
habere' est contemnere et aversari, haec enim odii sunt; `ab omnibus gentibus' est ab illis qui in malo sunt; quod `gentes' sint illi, videatur n. 1259, 1260, 1849, 1868, 2588 f.; `propter nomen Meum' 
est propter Dominum, ita propter omnia quae ab Ipso; quod `nomen Domini' sit omne in uno complexu per quod colitur, ita omne quod est Ecclesiae Ipsius, videatur n. 2724, 3006.  [4] `Et tunc offendentur 
multi, et se invicem tradent, et odio habebunt se invicem' significat propter illa inimicitias; `offendentur multi' est inimicitia inter se; Ipsum Humanum Domini est contra quod inimicitia; quod 
illud offendiculum {3}et scandalum futurum sit, passim in Verbo praedicitur; `se invicem tradent' est inimicitia inter se ex falso contra verum; `et odio habebunt se invicem' est inimicitia inter se 
ex malo contra bonum. [5] `Et multi pseudoprophetae exsurgent, et seducent multos' significat praedicationes falsi; `pseudoprophetae,' quod sint docentes falsa, ita `doctrina falsa, videatur n. 2534; 
`et seducent multos' est quod inde derivationes. [6] `Et propter multiplicari iniquitatem, refrigescet charitas multorum' significat cum fide exspirationem charitatis; `propter multiplicari iniquitatem' 
est secundum falsa fidei; `refrigescet charitas multorum' est exspiratio charitatis; utrumque enim pari passu vadit; ubi non est fides, ibi non est charitas, et ubi non est charitas, non est fides,
