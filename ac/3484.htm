<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3484节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3484.</strong>我通过大量经历逐渐得知，生命唯有一个，它属于主。这生命流入进来，使人存活，甚至善人与恶人同样存活。由物质材料构成的形式则与这生命相对应，这些形式凭借不断流入的神性而以它们看似凭自己存活的方式接受生命。这种对应关系就是生命器官与生命本身的对应关系。然而，接受器官的性质取决于他们所过的生活。那些拥有爱与仁在里面的人就具有对应关系，因为他们适合接受生命本身。而那些拥有爱与仁的反面在里面的人则不具有对应关系，因为他们不适合接受生命本身。因此，他们所接受的生命的性质取决于他们的性质。这一点可通过阳光所照射的属世形式来说明。接受形式的性质就决定了它们所反射之光的变化。在灵界，这些变化是属灵的；因此在那里，接受形式的性质就决定了他们所拥有的聪明智慧的性质。这就为何善灵和天使都显为仁爱的形式，而恶灵和地狱灵则显为仇恨的形式。</p>

From very much experience I have been instructed that there is but one only life, which is that of the Lord, and which flows in and causes man to live, nay, causes both the good and the evil to live. 
To this life correspond forms which are substances, and which by continual Divine influx are so vivified that they appear to themselves to live from themselves. This correspondence is that of the organs 
with their life; but such as  are the recipient organs, such is the life which they live. Those men who are in love and charity are in correspondence, for the life itself is received by them fitly; 
but they who are in what is contrary to love and charity are not in correspondence, because the life itself is not received fitly; hence such a life comes forth as is in accordance with their quality. 
This may be illustrated by natural forms into which the light of the sun flows; such as are the recipient forms, such are the modifications of light in connection with them. In the spiritual world 
the modifications are spiritual; and therefore in that world such as are the recipient forms, such is their intelligence and such their wisdom. Hence good spirits and angels appear as the very forms of 
charity, while wicked spirits and infernals appear as forms of hatred. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3484</b></p><p><b>3484.</b>
From very much experience I have come to know that there is but one life - the Lord's. This life flows in and gives life to man, to both good and evil alike. To that life the forms which consist of material 
substance correspond, and those forms - by means of a constant inflow of the Divine - receive life in such a way that they seem to themselves to live independently. This correspondence is a correspondence 
of the organs of life with life itself. Yet the nature of the recipient organs determines the kind of life they have. In those people who have love and charity within them that correspondence 
is present, for the life itself is received by them as it should be. But that correspondence is not present in those who have the reverse of love and charity within them, for the life itself is not 
received by them as it should be. Consequently the nature of the life received by them depends on what they are like themselves. This may be exemplified from the natural forms on to which the light 
of the sun falls - the nature of the forms receiving it determines the variations of the light reflected in them. In the spiritual world the variations are spiritual, and therefore the nature of recipient 
forms in that world determines that of the intelligence and the wisdom they have. This is why good spirits and angels are seen as embodiments of charity themselves, while evil and hellish spirits 
are seen as embodiments of hatred. </p>

</p><b>3484.</b>
A plurima experientia instructus sum quod non sit nisi unica vita, quae est Domini, quae influit et facit ut vivat homo, immo ut vivant tam boni quam mali; illi vitae correspondent formae quae sunt 
substantiae, quae per influxum continuum Divinum ita vivificantur ut appareant sibi vivere ex se; haec correspondentia est organorum cum vita; sed {1}qualia organa recipientia sunt, {2}taliter vivunt; 
illi homines qui in amore et charitate sunt, in correspondentia sunt, nam ipsa vita recipitur ab illis adaequate; illi vero qui in contrariis amori et charitati sunt, non in correspondentia sunt quia 
ipsa vita non recipitur adaequate; inde talis vita existit quales sunt: hoc illustrari potest a formis naturalibus in quas influit lux solis; quales formae recipientes sunt, tales modificationes lucis 
{3}illis sunt; in spirituali mundo modificationes sunt spirituales, {4}ideo ibi quales formae recipientes sunt, talis est illis intelligentia et talis sapientia: (m)inde est quod spiritus boni et angeli 
appareant ut ipsissimae formae charitatis, at spiritus mali et infernales ut formae odii.(n) @1 sicut$  @2 ita$  @3 A o; I has illi$  @4 inde$  </p>
