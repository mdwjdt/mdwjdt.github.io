<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8310.</strong>出埃及记15:14-16.万民听见就发颤，疼痛抓住非利士的居民；那时，以东的族长惊惶，摩押的强者被战兢抓住，迦南所有的居民都融化。惊骇恐惧临到他们。耶和华啊，因你膀臂的巨大，他们如石头被砍掉，等候你的百姓过去，等候你所拥有的这百姓过去。<br />“万民听见”表各处所有陷入邪恶所生的虚假之人。“就发颤”表恐惧。“疼痛抓住非利士的居民”表那些坚持与良善分离的信仰之人对扩大他们统治的绝望。“那时，以东的族长惊惶”表那些由于自我之爱而过着邪恶生活之人的类似感觉。“摩押的强者”表那些由于这爱而过着虚假生活的人。“被战兢抓住”表他们一件事也不敢尝试。“迦南所有的居民都融化”表那些属于教会，却玷污良善，歪曲真理之人的类似感觉。“惊骇恐惧临到他们”表他们毫无统治的任何希望。“因你膀臂的巨大”表由于全能。“他们如石头被砍掉”表像一个重物那样坠落。“等候你的百姓过去”表因此无需冒着侵扰的危险，凡能接受良善之真理和真理之良善的人都会得救。“等候这百姓过去”表那些属于教会，处于真理和良善的人将以这种方式得救。”你所拥有的”表由此而属于主的人。</p>

Verses 14-16. The peoples have heard, they have trembled, pain hath laid hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed, the mighty ones of Moab, terror hath laid hold of 
them, all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted. Fright and dread are fallen upon them; in the greatness of Thine arm they shall be destroyed as a stone, until Thy people shall pass over, O Jehovah, until 
shall pass over this people which Thou hast taken possession of. "The peoples have heard," signifies all who are in falsity from evil everywhere; "they have trembled," signifies terror; "pain hath 
laid hold of the inhabitants of Philistia," signifies despair of enlarging their dominion on the part of those who are in faith separate from good; "then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed," signifies 
the like with those who are in a life of evil from the love of self; "the mighty ones of Moab," signifies those who are in a life of falsity from this love; "terror hath laid hold of them," signifies 
that they have dared nothing; "all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted," signifies the like with those who had been of the church, and have adulterated goods, and falsified truths; "fright and dread 
are fallen upon them," signifies that they are without any hope of domination; "in the greatness of Thine arm," signifies by virtue of omnipotence; "they shall be destroyed as a stone," signifies a falling 
down like a weight; "until Thy people shall pass over," signifies that thus without danger of infestation all shall be saved who are capable of receiving the truth of good and the good of truth; 
"until shall pass over this people," signifies that thus shall be saved those of the church who are in truth and good; "which Thou hast taken possession of," signifies who have thus become the Lord's. </p>

Verses 14-16 The peoples heard, they trembled; distress took hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; the powerful ones of Moab, terror took hold of them; all the 
inhabitants of Canaan melted away. Alarm and dread fell on them; by the greatness of Your arm they are cut away, like a stone, till Your people pass over, O Jehovah, till this people pass over [whom] 
You have possessed. </p>
<p>'The peoples heard' means all everywhere who were ruled by falsity arising from evil. 'They trembled' means terror. 'Distress took hold of the inhabitants of Philistia' means despair 
of enlarging their dominion, on the part of those upholding faith separated from good. 'Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed' means a like feeling on the part of those leading a life of evil arising 
from self-love. 'The powerful ones of Moab' means those leading a life of falsity resulting from that love. 'Terror took hold of them' means that they did not dare to attempt a single thing. 'All 
the inhabitants of Canaan melted away' means a like feeling on the part of those belonging to the Church who adulterated forms of good and who falsified truths. 'Alarm and dread fell on them' means 
that they were without any hope of dominion. 'By the greatness of Your arm' means as a result of almighty power. 'They will be cut away like a stone' means descent like a heavy object. 'Till Your people 
pass over' means that therefore without risk of molestation all capable of receiving the truth of good and the good of truth will be saved. 'Till this people pass over' means that in this way those 
belonging to the Church who are governed by truth and good will be saved. 'You have possessed' means who have thereby become the Lord's.

Vers. 14-16.  Audiverunt populi, contremuerunt, dolor apprehendit habitatores Philisthaeae.  Tunc consternati sunt duces Edomi, potentes Moabi, apprehendit illos terror; colliquefacti omnes habitatores 
Canaanis.  Cecidit super illos formido et pavor; in magnitudine brachii Tui exscinduntur sicut lapis, usque dum transibit populus Tuus, Jehovah, usque dum transibit populus hic, possedisti.  `Audiverunt 
populi' significat omnes qui in falso ex malo ubique: `contremuerunt' significat terrorem: `dolor apprehendit habitatores Philisthaeae' significat desperationem amplificandi dominium apud illos 
qui in fide separata a bono: `tunc consternati sunt duces Edomi' significat simile apud illos qui in vita mali ex amore sui: `potentes Moabi' significat qui in vita falsi ex illo amore: `apprehendit 
illos terror' significat quod nihil ausi sint: `colliquefacti omnes habitatores Canaanis' significat simile apud illos qui ab Ecclesia et adulteraverunt bona et falsificaverunt vera: `cecidit super illos 
formido et {1}pavor' significat quod absque ulla spe dominationis: `in magnitudine brachii Tui' significat ex omnipotentia `exscindentur sicut lapis' significat delapsum sicut grave: `usque dum transibit 
populus Tuus' significat quod sic absque discrimine infestationis salvabuntur omnes qui in facultate recipiendi verum boni et bonum veri: `usque dum transibit populus hic' significat quod sic 
salvabuntur qui in vero et bono ab Ecclesia: `possedisti' significat qui sic facti sunt Domini. 	@1 terror I$ </p>
