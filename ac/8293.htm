<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8293节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8293.</strong>“我的灵魂要充满它们”表快乐。这是显而易见的，无需解释。经上之所以说“我的灵魂要充满”，是因为那些地狱里的人的主要快乐是伤害他人；在有些情况下，其目的只是为了快乐，不是别的；在有些情况下，其目的就是叫他们沦为奴隶，那时他们想要残忍对待他们。在来世，那些过着邪恶生活的人就具有这种快乐，这一事实几乎无人相信，甚至连他们自己都不相信。因为只要在世上，他们就受到恐惧的约束，即对法律的制裁、以及失去地位、财富、名声，以及生命的恐惧。那时，这些恐惧使他们放弃外在的恶行，由此以为他们不是他们本来就是的这种人。但当他们摆脱了失去生命、财富、地位和名声的反思，如在来世的情形，并任由自己陷入邪恶时，隐藏在意愿中，并且每当他们除去这些恐惧时就会暴露出来的作恶的快乐就会清楚显明出来。现在这种快乐构成他们的生命，这种生命是地狱的生命。</p>

My soul shall be filled with them. That this signifies delight, is evident without explication. It is said, "my soul shall be filled," because the very delight of those who are in hell is to inflict 
evil on others; with some, for no other end than for the sake of the delight; with some, to the end that they may be reduced to slavery, and whom they desire to treat cruelly afterward. That they who 
are in evil of life have such a delight in the other life, scarcely any can believe, not even themselves; for so long as they are in the world they are restrained by fears of legal penalties, also of 
the loss of honors, wealth, reputation, and even of life. These fears cause them at that time to abstain from evils in externals; and from this they suppose that they are not of such a character; but 
when reflections upon the loss of life, of wealth, of honors, and of reputation are taken away from them, as is the case in the other life, and they are left to their evil, then the delight of doing evil, 
which had lain hidden in the will and had put itself forth whenever they could remove these fears, shows itself clearly. This delight then makes their life, which life is infernal life. </p>

'My soul will be filled' means delight. This is clear without explanation. The words 'my soul will be filled' are used because the chief delight of those in hell lies in doing harm to others, in some 
cases for no reason other than the delight gained in doing it, in other cases with a view to turning them into slaves, whom they then wish to treat cruelly. The fact that this kind of delight exists 
in the next life with people who lead a life of evil can be believed by scarcely anyone, including even those people themselves. For as long as they are in the world they are constrained by fears - of 
legal punishments, as well as of loss of position, wealth, reputation, and also life. These fears cause them at that time to refrain from evil deeds in their outward behaviour, as a result of which they 
imagine that they are not the kind of people they really are. But when they are released from having to think about possible loss of life, wealth, position, and reputation, as happens in the next 
life, and they are left to their own evil, the delight to do harm, which has lain hidden in the will and has emerged as often as they could remove those fears, reveals itself. That delight now constitutes 
their life, a life that is the life of hell. </p>

</p><b>8293.</b>
`Implebitur anima mea': quod {1}sit jucundum, constat absque explicatione.  `Implebitur anima mea' dicitur quia ipsum jucundum illorum qui in inferno sunt est malum inferre aliis apud quosdam ob nullum 
finem, solum propter jucundum; apud quosdam propter finem ut redigantur ad servitia quae crudeliter postea tractare volunt; quod tale jucundum in altera vita sit illis qui in malo vitae sunt, vix 
aliqui possunt credere et ne quidem ipsi, nam quamdiu in mundo sunt, coercentur a timoribus, qui sunt poenarum legis, tum jacturae honorum, opum, famae, et quoque vitae; hi timores tunc faciunt ut abstineant 
malis in externis, ac inde putant quod non tales sint; sed cum reflexiones super jacturam vitae, opum, honorum, famae, illis adimuntur, ut fit in altera vita, et relinquuntur suo malo, tunc jucundum 
malum faciendi, quod latuit in voluntate, et exseruit se quoties removere potuissent timores illos, se manifestat; id jucundum tunc facit vitam illorum, quae vita est vita infernalis. 	@1 significet 
jucundum, constat ex significatione impleri anima, quod sit jucundum vitae; quod id jucundum vitae sit, est quia cum homo in jucundo est, ut cum si succedunt res, respiratio ejus plena sit et libera, 
ita pectus anima impletum, n. 3750, 7411$ </p>
