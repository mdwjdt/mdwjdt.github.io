<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4627.</strong>但那些与鼻孔内部相关之人的觉知状态比那些与鼻孔外部相关之人的更完美。关于前者，我可以讲述以下经历。我曾看见貌似浴缸的东西，带有长座位或长凳，还冒着热气。一个女人出现在那里，但很快消失在一片乌云中。我还听见小孩子说，他们不想去那里。随后我发现一群天使，他们被差到我这里，是要预先制止某些恶灵的努力。就在这时，我的额头上突然出现了一些大大小小的缝隙，一道美丽的黄光透过这些缝隙闪耀；在缝隙里面的这光中，我看见一些雪白的女人。后来一些以不同方式排列的缝隙出现了，里面的女人正透过这些缝隙向外张望；更多的缝隙又出现了，只是从这些缝隙透出来的光更少。<br />最后，我看到一道明亮的白光，并被告知，此处是那些构成内鼻孔区域的女人的居所（因为那里的人都是女性成员）；我所看到的各种缝隙在灵人界，就代表那里的女人觉知的敏锐。因为在天上，属灵事物通过属世事物来代表，确切地说，通过灵人界中类似于属世事物的那种事物来代表。此后，我蒙允许与那些女人交谈；她们说，透过这些代表性的缝隙，她们能精确地看到下面发生的事；并且可以看出，这些缝隙面对她们所努力观察的社群。由于这时缝隙转向我，所以这些女人说，她们能发现我的一切思想观念，以及我周围之人的观念。此外，她们声称，他们不仅发现这些观念，还看到它们以多种方式被代表，例如：对良善的情感由相应的小火焰来代表，对真理的情感由光的变化来代表。她们补充说，她们看见一些天使社群与我同在，这些社群的思维由五颜六色的物体、诸如我们在彩绘窗帘上所看到那种紫红染料，以及背景较暗的彩虹色来代表。她们说，她们从这些代表发觉，那些天使社群属于眼睛的区域。<br />此后，我又看见其他灵人从那里被赶下来，分散到各处。论到这些人，这些女人说，她们钻营到自己的同伴那里，是为了发现点什么，看看下面发生了什么事，但怀有阴险意图。每当天使群靠近并与我交谈时，我就看见那些灵人被赶了下去。至于被赶下去的人，这些女人说，她们与鼻涕有关，缺乏觉知和聪明，以及良知，因而完全没有任何内在觉知。我在前面看见并提到的那个女人就表示怀有阴险意图的那类女人。我也蒙允许与这些女人交谈，她们对任何有良知的人却完全不知道何为良知的观念感到惊讶。但当我说，良知就是对良善与真理的一种内在觉知，违背这种觉知行事会造成焦虑和痛苦时，她们却不明白这话。这就是那些与刺激鼻子、因而从鼻孔被擤出的鼻涕相对应之人的性质。<br />后来又有一种光指给我看，那些与鼻孔内部有关的女人就生活在这光中。这是一种因束束金色火焰和银光而发生美丽变化的光；在这光中，束束金色火焰代表对良善的情感，束束银光代表对真理的情感。我还被指示，她们拥有在左侧打开的缝隙，并透过这些缝隙仿佛看到布满星星的蓝色天空；我被告知，她们的房间里有一道光如此明亮，以致世上的正午之光根本无法与之相比。我进一步被告知，那里的热就像早夏之热，或春夏之交的热；这些女性天使与几岁的小孩子一起生活；但当怀有阴险意图，也就是鼻涕所指的女人到来时，这些小孩子就不愿在那里。诸如此类的无数代表可在灵人界看到；不过，这些是那些与内部鼻孔的嗅觉相对应的女性天使所享有的觉知的代表。</p>

Those, however, who relate to the interiors of the nostrils are in a more perfect state of perception than those (just treated of) who relate to their exteriors. Concerning the former I may give the 
following account. I saw as it were a bath, with long seats or benches, and from it heat exhaled. A woman appeared there who soon vanished into a blackish cloud and I heard little children saying that 
they did not desire to be there. Soon afterwards I observed some angelic choirs, who were sent to me for the purpose of averting the endeavors of certain evil spirits; and then suddenly above the forehead 
there appeared little apertures, greater or less, through which a beautiful yellow light was shining; and in this light within the apertures I saw some women in a snowy radiance. There afterwards 
again appeared little apertures in a different arrangement, through which the women within were looking out; and again other little apertures through which the light did not so freely pass.  [2] Finally 
I observed a bright white light, and was told that here were the abodes of those women who constitute the province of the internal nostrils (for they were of the female sex); and that the clearsightedness 
of perception of those who are there, is represented in the world of spirits by such apertures. For the spiritual things in heaven are represented in the world of Spirits by natural things, 
or rather by such things as are similar to those which are natural. It was afterwards given me to speak with them, and they said that through these representative apertures they can see with exactness 
what is being done below, and that the apertures appear turned to those societies which they are occupied in observing. And as they were then turned to me, they said that they could observe all the 
ideas of my thought, and also those of the people around me. They said moreover that they did not merely observe the ideas, but also saw them represented in many ways, as for instance those of the affection 
of good by correspondent little flames, and those of the affection of truth by variations of light. They added that they saw certain angelic societies with me, and their thoughts represented by 
objects of many colors, by crimson dyes such as we see on painted curtains, and also by the colors of the rainbow on a darker ground, and they said that they thus perceived those angelic societies to 
be of the province of the eye.  [3] Afterwards other spirits were seen who were cast down from thence and scattered about hither and thither, of whom they said that they were such as had insinuated 
themselves among them for the purpose of observing something, and of seeing what was going on below, but with an insidious purpose. This casting down was observed whenever angelic choirs approached and 
entered into conversation with me. As regards those who were cast down, they said that they relate to the mucus of the nostrils, and that they are dull and stupid, and also devoid of conscience, thus 
altogether devoid of interior perception. The woman who was seen (as mentioned above) signified such female ensnarers. With these also it was given me to speak, and they expressed their surprise at 
anyone's having conscience, being quite ignorant of what conscience is; and when I said that it is an interior perception of what is good and true, and that to act contrary to it causes anxiety, this 
they did not understand. Such are those who correspond to the mucus which infests the nostrils and is therefore ejected. [4] There was afterwards shown me the kind of light in which those live who relate 
to the interiors of the nostrils. It was a light beautifully varied with veins of golden flame and silver light, the affections of good being represented therein by the veins of golden flame, and 
the affections of truth by the veins of silver light. I was also shown that they have apertures opening at the side, through which they see as it were a sky with stars in the blue, and I was told that 
in their chambers there is a light so great as to immeasurably surpass the noonday light of this world. I was further told that the heat there is like that of early summer on earth, and also that these 
angels of the female sex are accompanied by little children of some years who are unwilling to stay when the female ensnarers (or mucuses) arrive. Numberless such representatives appear in the world 
of spirits; but these were representative of the perceptions in which are those female angels who correspond to the sense of smell in the interiors of the nostrils. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4627</b></p><p><b>4627.</b>
But the state of perception among those who correlate with the interior parts of the nostrils is more perfect than it is among those described above, who correlate with the exterior parts. Let the following 
be told regarding the former. I once saw what looked like a bath which had long seats or benches, and which was steaming. A woman then appeared there, who shortly disappeared into a blackening 
cloud. I also heard young children saying they didn't want to be there. After that I noticed a group of angels who were sent to me to forestall the endeavours of certain evil spirits. At this point some 
openings suddenly appeared above my forehead, large and small ones, through which a lovely yellow light was shining, and in this light within the openings I saw certain women in snowy white. Then 
some more openings appeared, arranged in a different way, through which the women within them were looking out; and again even more openings appeared through which less light was passing. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Finally 
I was aware of a brilliant white light. I was told that here were situated the dwelling-places of those women who constitute the province of the inner nostrils - for those there were members of the 
female sex - and that the sharpness of perception of the women there is represented in the world of spirits by means of the kinds of openings I saw. For spiritual things in heaven are represented by 
means of natural ones, or rather by means of the kinds of things in the world of spirits that resemble natural ones. After this I was allowed to speak to those women, who said that through the representative 
openings they were able to have a perfect view of things happening below, and that the openings, as could be seen, were facing the communities which they were endeavouring to observe. And because 
at that time the openings were facing in my direction, the women said that they were able to detect all the ideas forming my thought, and also the ideas of those around me. More than that, they declared 
that they not only detected those ideas but also saw them represented in varying ways - those of the affection for good, for example, by appropriate little flames, those of the affection for truth 
by variations of light. They added that they saw certain angelic communities present with me, the thoughts of these communities being represented by objects of many different colours, by purple shades 
of colour like those used on painted curtains, and also by the colours of the rainbow set against a darker background. From these representations, they said, they perceived that those angelic communities 
belonged to the province of the eye. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 After this I saw some other spirits who were cast down from there and were scattered in all directions. Speaking about these, the women said that they 
were the kind of spirits who had wormed their way into their own company to find something out, and to see what was going on below, but with insidious intentions. I saw those spirits being cast down 
every time groups of angels drew near, to whom also I spoke. These said, referring to the ones who were cast down, that they correlated with mucus in the nose and that they were lacking in perception 
and intelligence, as well as in conscience, and thus were utterly devoid of any interior perception. The woman whom I had seen, and have referred to above, represented such women as have insidious 
intentions. I was allowed to speak to these women also. These were astonished by the idea that anyone possessing conscience should have no knowledge at all of what conscience is. But when I said that 
conscience was an inward discernment of goodness and truth, and that acting contrary to that discernment gave rise to distress, they did not understand this. Such is the nature of those who correspond 
to the mucus which irritates the nose and is therefore expelled from it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 I was then shown what the bright light is in which those women live who correlate with the inner parts of the nostrils. 
It was a light beautifully varied by beams of golden flame and silver light, affections for good being represented in it by the beams of golden flame, and affections for truth by those of silver light. 
I was also shown that they have openings positioned at the side, through which they see what looks like a blue sky studded with stars; and I was told that the light in their chambers is so bright that 
not even the light of the world at midday can be compared to it. In addition I was told that the temperature where these women are is warm, like that in spring and summer on earth; and that young 
children, who are just a few years old, also live with them, but that these do not wish to be there when the women with insidious intentions, who are meant by mucus, come around. Countless representatives 
such as these are seen in the world of spirits, but these were representatives of the perceptions which those women share who correspond to the sense of smell possessed by the inner nostrils. </p>

Qui autem referunt interiora narium, in perfectiore statu quoad perceptionem sunt quam illi qui referunt exteriora earum, de quibus supra; de illis haec licet referre: visum mihi sicut balneum cum 
longis sedilibus seu scamnis, et inde {1}efflabat calor; </p>
<p>apparuit ibi mulier, quae mox disparabatur in nubem nigricantem; et quoque auditi infantes, dicentes quod ibi non esse vellent: </p>
<p>postmodum 
aliqui chori angelici sunt appercepti, qui ad me missi avertendi conatus quorundam malorum spirituum causa; et tunc subito supra frontem apparebant foraminula majora et minora, per quae translucebat 
lux pulchre flavescens, et in lucido illo intra foraminula visae (t)sunt quaedam in niveo; et dein apparebant iterum foraminula alia dispositione, per quae {2}illae quae intus erant, transpiciebant; 
et rursus alia foraminula, per quae lucidum non ita transmeabat; demum percepta lux candescens: dicebatur mihi quod 2 ibi essent domicilia earum quae constituunt provinciam narium internarum, erant 
enim ex sexu feminino,' et quod perspicacia perceptionis illarum quae ibi, in mundo spirituum per talia foramina repraesentetur; spiritualia enim in caelo repraesentantur per naturalia, seu potius, 
per talia quae naturalium similia sunt {3}in mundo spirituum; postea dabatur loqui cum illis, et dicebant quod per repraesentativa illa foramina possent exacte videre illa quae infra fierent, 
et quod foramina illa appareant conversa ad illas societates quas observare satagebant, et quia tunc ad me, dicebant quod {4}appercipere possent omnes cogitationis meae ideas, et quoque illorum qui 
circum me erant; insuper aiebant quod non solum apperciperent ideas, sed etiam viderent illas varie sibi repraesentatas, sicut quae affectionis boni essent per flammulas convenientes, et quae affectionis 
veri essent per lucis variationes; adjiciebant quod viderint quasdam angelicas societates apud me, et illarum {5}cogitationes per varie colorata, per purpuracea qualia in aulaeis pictis, 
et quoque per iridea in plano obscuriore, et quod inde perceperint quod societates illae angelicae essent ex provincia oculi.  Visi dein alii spiritus qui inde dejecti sunt, et huc 3 illuc dispersi, 
de quibus dicebant quod tales essent qui se apud illas insinuaverant causa appercipiendi aliquid et videndi quid infra ageretur, sed fine insidiandi; haec dejectio observata est quoties angelici 
chori adventabant, cum quibus etiam locutus sum; de illis qui dejecti, dicebant quod referrent mucum narium et quod essent hebetes et stupidi, et quoque absque conscientia, ita prorsus absque perceptione 
interiore; mulier quae visa, de qua supra, significabat tales insidiatrices, cum illis quoque loqui dabatur, et miratae sunt quod aliquis conscientiam habeat, nesciebant prorsus quid conscientia; 
et cum dicerem quod sit interior apperceptio boni et veri, et si agitur contra illam apperceptionem, quod sit anxietas, {6} hoc non intellexerunt; tales sunt {7}qui correspondent muco qui infestat 
nares, et qui ideo ejicitur.  Ostensum mihi dein lucidum in quo vivunt quae interna narium {8}referunt, erat lucidum variatum pulchre venis flammae aureae et lucis argenteae, affectiones boni 
(t)repraesentantur ibi per venas flammae aureae, et affectiones veri per venas lucis argenteae.  Et quoque ostensum quod habeant foramina patentia a latere, per quae vident sicut caelum cum stellis 
in caeruleo; et dictum quod in conclavibus earum tanta lux sit ut meridiana mundi aequiparari nequeat: et insuper dictum, quod apud {9}illas calor sit sicut vernalis et aestivus in terra; et quod 
etiam infantes apud eas sint, sed infantes aliquot annorum; et quod ibi esse non velint cum insidiatrices illae, seu muci, adventant.  Talia repraesentativa apparent innumerabilia in mundo spirituum;
