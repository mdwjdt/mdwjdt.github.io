<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2149节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2149.</strong>“见有三个人在他对面站着”表神性本身，神性人和神圣活动。这是显而易见的，无需解释。因为人人都知道三位一体的存在，这三位一体是一位。三位一体就是一位，这从本章非常明显地看出来，如下面3节经文说：“他说，我主，若我祈求在你眼前蒙恩，求你不要离开你的仆人”，这些话是说给那三个人听的。此外，10节经文说：“有一位说，我必要回到你这里”；13节：“耶和华对亚伯拉罕说”；15节：“那位说，不然，你实在笑了”；17节：“耶和华说，我所要作的事岂可瞒着亚伯拉罕呢”；19节：“因为我知道他”；20节：“耶和华说”；21节：“我要下去，察看他们所行的，是否真的像那达到我这里的嚷叫声一样；若是不然，我也必知道”；23节：“亚伯拉罕说，你真要将义人和恶人一同毁灭吗”；25节：“你绝不会做这样的事；你绝不会这样”；26节：“耶和华说，我若在那城当中找到五十个义人，我就为他们的缘故饶恕那地方”；27节：“求你容我大胆向我主说”；28节：“你就因为少了五个而毁灭全城吗？祂说，我在那里若找到四十五个，就不毁灭这城”；29节：“亚伯拉罕又向祂说话；祂说，为这四十个的缘故，我也不毁灭这城”；30节：“求我主不要动怒；祂说，我在那里若找到三十个，我也不毁灭这城”；31节：“亚伯拉罕说，求你容我大胆继续向我主说；祂说，为这二十个的缘故，我也不毁灭这城”；32节：“亚伯拉罕说，求我主不要动怒；祂说，为这十个的缘故，我也不毁灭这城”；33节：“耶和华与亚伯拉罕讲完话就走了”。由此可见，向亚伯拉罕显现的那三个人表示神性本身，神性人和神圣活动，这三位一体本身就是一位。就内义而言，此处所论述的主题是耶和华，因为祂向主显现，尽管显现的方式不同于向亚伯拉罕显现的方式。亚伯拉罕看见那三个人是真实的历史事件，不过，这代表神性直觉，或从主处于人身时所拥有的神性所接受的直觉。这种直觉将在下文予以论述。</p>

Behold three men standing over him. That this signifies the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding, may be seen without explication; for it is known to everyone that there is a Trine, 
and that this Trine is a One.* That it is a One is plainly evident in this chapter, to wit, in verse 3, where it is said, "He said, My Lord, if I pray I have found grace in Thine eyes, pass Thou not, 
I pray," which words were addressed to the three men. And further, in verse 10, "And he said, Returning I will return unto thee." In verse 13, "And Jehovah said unto Abraham." In verse 15, "He said, 
Nay, but thou didst laugh." In verse 17, "And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do?" In verse 19, "Because I have known him." In verse 20, "And Jehovah said." In verse 21, "I will 
go down, and I will see whether they have made a consummation according to the cry thereof which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know." In verse 23, Abraham said, "Wilt Thou also destroy the righteous 
with the wicked?" In verse 25, "Be it far from Thee to do according to this thing; be it far from Thee." In verse 26, "And Jehovah said, If I find fifty righteous I will spare the whole place for 
their sake." In verse 27, "I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord." In verse 28, "Wilt Thou destroy the whole city for five? And He said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five." 
In verse 29, "He added yet to speak unto Him; He said, I will not do it for forty's sake." In verse 30, "Let not my Lord be angry; He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there." In verse 31, "He said, 
I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord; He said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake." In verse 32, "Let not I pray my Lord be angry; and He said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake." And 
in verse 33, "And Jehovah went when He had left off speaking to Abraham." From all this it may be seen that by the three men who appeared to Abraham was signified the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, 
and the Holy proceeding; and that this Trine is in itself a One. In the internal sense the subject here treated of is Jehovah, in that He appeared to the Lord, and that the Lord perceived this; but 
not by an appearing such as there was to Abraham; for it is historically true that three men were seen by Abraham, but this represents the Divine perception, or the perception from the Divine which the 
Lord had when in the Human, which perception is treated of in what follows. * That is, a complex whole which constitutes a unity. [Reviser.] </p>

'Behold, three men standing over him' means the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding. This becomes clear without explanation, for everyone knows that a Trinity exists, and that this 
Trinity is a Unity. That it is a Unity is quite evident in this chapter, as in verse 3 that follows where it is said, 'He said, My Lord, if now I have found grace in your eyes, do not now pass from 
over your servant',<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> words that were addressed to the three men. In addition to this it is said - </p>
<p> In verse 10, And He said, 'I will certainly return to you.  In verse 13, And Jehovah said to Abraham. In 
verse 15, He said, 'No, but you did laugh'. In verse 17, And Jehovah said, 'Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am going to do?' In verse 19, 'For I know him'. In verse 20, And Jehovah 
said. In verse 21, 'I will go down and I will see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which has come up to Me; and if not, I will know'. In verse 23, Abraham said, 'Will You 
also destroy the righteous with the wicked?' In verse 25, 'Far be it from You to do such a thing, far be it from You'. In verse 26, And Jehovah said, 'If I find fifty righteous persons, I will spare 
the whole place for their sakes'. In verse 27, 'I have undertaken to speak to my Lord'. In verse 28, 'Will You for five destroy the whole city?' And He said, 'I will not destroy it if I find forty-five 
there'. In verse 29, He spoke to Him yet again. He said, 'I will not do it for the sake of the forty,. In verse 30, 'Let not my Lord be incensed'. He said, 'I will not do it if I find thirty there'. In 
verse 31, 'I have undertaken to speak to my Lord'. He said, 'I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty'. In verse 32, 'Let not now my Lord be incensed. And He said, 'I will not destroy 
it for the sake of the ten'. In verse 33, And Jehovah departed, when He had finished speaking to Abraham. </p>
<p>From all these places it becomes clear that the three men who appeared to Abraham meant 
the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding, and that in itself the Trinity is a Unity. The subject at this point in the internal sense is Jehovah's appearing to the Lord and the Lord's 
perceiving this, though not by means of an appearing such as was made to Abraham, for the event of the three men seen by Abraham is historically true, but it represents Divine perception or a perception 
received from the Divine which the Lord had when He was in the human. This perception is dealt with in what follows.

`Ecce tres viri stantes super illum': quod significet Divinum Ipsum, Humanum Divinum et Sanctum procedens, constare potest absque explicatione, nam unicuivis notum est quod Trinum sit, et hoc Trinum 
Unum; quod Unum sit, in hoc capite manifeste patet, nempe vers. seq. 3, ubi dicitur, `Dixit, Domine mi, si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis Tuis, ne quaeso transeas {1},' quae dicta ad tres viros: insuper 
vers. 20, `Et dixit, Revertendo revertar ad te {2}: vers. 13, `Et dixit Jehovah ad Abraham': vers. 15, Dixit {3}, Non, quod risisti': vers. 17, `Et Jehovah dixit, Num celans Ego ab Abrahamo, quod 
Ego faciens?: vers. 19, `Quia novi illum': vers. 20, `Et dixit Jehovah': vers. 21, `Descendam et {4} videbo, num secundum clamorem ejus, qui venit ad Me, fecerint consummationem, et si non, cognoscam': 
vers. 23, `{5} Abraham dixit, Num etiam delebis justum cum impio?: vers. 25, `Absit Tibi, a faciendo {6} secundum rem hanc, absit Tibi': vers. 26, `Et dixit Jehovah, Si invenero quinquaginta justos, 
parcam toti loco propter eos': vers. 27, `Suscepi ad loquendum ad Dominum meum': vers. 28, `Num disperdes in quinque totam urbem? et dixit, Non perdam, si invenero ibi (x)quadraginta quinque': vers. 
29, `{5} Addidit adhuc loqui ad Ipsum: dixit, Non faciam propter quadraginta': vers. 30, `Ne succenseatur {4} Domino meo, dixit, Non faciam, si invenero ibi triginta': vers. 31, `Suscepi ad loquendum 
ad Dominum meum; dixit, Non perdam propter viginti': vers. 32, `Ne quaeso succenseatur Domino meo: et dixit, Non perdam propter decem': vers. 33, `Et ivit Jehovah, quando absolvit loqui ad Abraham' Exinde 
constare potest quod per `tres viros, qui apparuerunt Abrahamo' significatum sit Divinum Ipsum, (t)Humanum Divinum et Sanctum procedens, et quod Trinum in se Unum sit: in sensu interno agitur hic 
de Jehovah quod apparuerit Domino et quod Dominus hoc perceperit, sed non per apparitionem, qualis fuit Abrahamo; nam quod tres viri visi Abrahamo, est historicum verum, sed repraesentat Divinam Perceptionem 
seu perceptionem ex Divino quae fuit Domino cum in humano, de qua perceptione in sequentibus agitur. 	@1 i desuper servo tuo.$ 	@2 i juxta tempus hoc vitae.$ 	@3 i Negavit Sarah et.$ 	@4
