Verses 2-6. The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth four cubits, for one curtain; one measure for all the curtains. Five curtains shall be joined together one to the 
other; and five curtains shall be joined together one to the other. And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain at the extremity in the joining, and so shalt thou do in the edge 
of the uttermost curtain in the second joining together. Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the extremity of the curtain that is in the second joining 
together; the loops shall be taken up one to the other. And thou shalt make fifty hooks of gold, and shalt join together the curtains one to another in the hooks, and it shall be one Habitation. "The 
length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits," signifies the holiness of truth from good; "and the breadth four cubits," signifies the marriage of truth with good; "for one curtain," signifies 
thus for each of the truths; "one measure for all the curtains," signifies a like state of the matter; "five curtains shall be joined together one to the other, and five curtains shall be joined 
together one to the other," signifies the constant communication of truth with good, and of good with truth; "and thou shalt make loops of blue," signifies conjunction through the celestial love of truth; 
"upon the edge of the one curtain at the extremity in the joining," signifies of one sphere with the other; "and so shalt thou do in the edge of the uttermost curtain in the second joining together," 
signifies thus reciprocally; "fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain," signifies complete conjunction in the ultimates of the spheres; "and fifty loops shalt thou make in the extremity of 
the curtain that is in the second joining together," signifies in like manner reciprocally; "the loops shall be taken up one to the other," signifies conjunction in every way on both sides; "and thou 
shalt make fifty hooks of gold," signifies a full capability of conjunction from good; "and shalt join together the curtains one to the other in the hooks," signifies the method of conjunction everywhere; 
"and it shall be one Habitation," signifies the whole heaven thus altogether one. </p>

Verses 2-6 The length of one curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four cubits; [this is what] one curtain [shall be]. All the curtains shall have one measure. Five curtains shall be 
joined together, each one to the next, and five curtains joined together, each one to the next. And you shall make loops of violet on the edge of the one curtain at the end in the joining-place, and you 
shall do the same in the edge of the end curtain in the complementary joining-place. Fifty loops you shall make in the one curtain, and fifty loops you shall make in the end of the curtain which is 
in the complementary joining-place; the loops must be taken up, each one towards the other. And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains together, each one to the next in the clasps; 
and the dwelling-place shall be one.  'The length of one curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits' means the holiness of the truth derived from good. 'And the breadth four cubits' means the marriage of 
truth to good. '[This is what] one curtain [shall be]' means so shall it be for the individual truths. 'All the curtains shall have one measure' means that the state of affairs shall be the same [with 
each one]. 'Five curtains shall be joined together, each one to the next, and five curtains joined together, each one to the next' means unceasing communication of truth with good and of good with truth. 
'And you shall make loops of violet' means a joining together by means of the celestial love of truth. 'On the edge of the one curtain at the end in the joining-place' means of one sphere to the 
other. 'And you shall do the same in the edge of the end curtain in the complementary joining-place' means a reciprocal joining together of the same kind. 'Fifty loops you shall make in the one curtain' 
means a complete joining together in the outermost parts of the spheres. 'And fifty loops you shall make in the end of the curtain which is in the complementary joining-place' again means a reciprocal 
joining together of the same kind. 'The loops must be taken up, each one towards the other' means a total joining together on both sides. 'And you shall make fifty clasps of gold' means a complete 
ability derived from good to join things together. 'And join the curtains together, each one to the next in the clasps' means the mode of the joining together at every point. 'And the dwelling-place 
shall be one' means that the whole heaven is as a result altogether one.  </p>

Vers. 2-6. Longitudo aulaei unius octo et viginti in cubito, et latitudo quattuor in cubito, aulaeum unum; mensura una omnibus aulaeis. Quinque aulaea erunt conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum, et quinque 
aulaea conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum. Et facies loramenta hyacinthini super ora aulaei unius ab extremitate in junctura, ac ita facies in ora aulaei extremi in conjunctura altera. Quinquaginta loramenta 
facies in aulaeo uno, et quinquaginta loramenta facies in extremitate aulaei quae in conjunctura altera; suscepta erunt loramenta, quodvis ad alterum. Et facies quinquaginta ansulas auri, et conjunges 
aulaea, quodvis ad alterum in ansulis, et erit habitaculum unum. `Longitudo aulaei unius octo et viginti in cubito' significat sanctum veri ex bono: `et latitudo quattuor in cubito' significat conjugium 
veri cum bono: `aulaeum unum' significat ita singulis veris: `mensura una omnibus aulaeis' significat statum rei similem: `quinque aulaea erunt conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum, et quinque aulaea 
conjuncta, quodvis ad alterum' significat communicationem veri cum bono et boni cum vero constantem: et facies loramenta hyacinthini' significat conjunctionem per caelestem amorem veri: `super ora aulaei 
unius ab extremitate in junctura' significat unius sphaerae cum altera: `ac ita facies in ora aulaei extremi in conjunctura altera' significat ita reciproce: `quinquaginta loramenta facies in aulaeo 
uno' significat conjunctionem plenariam in sphaerarum ultimis: `et quinquaginta loramenta facies in extremitate aulaei quae in conjunctura altera' significat similiter reciproce: `suscepta erunt loramenta, 
quodvis ad alterum' significat conjunctionem utrinque omnimodam: `et facies quinquaginta ansulas auri' {1}significat plenariam conjunctionis facultatem a bono: `et conjunges aulaea, quodvis 
ad alterum in ansulis' significat modum conjunctionis ubivis: `et erit habitaculum unum' significat totum caelum ita prorsus unum. @1 est$ </p>
