<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3348节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3348.</strong>来自另一个星球的灵人曾和我呆了很长一段时间；在此期间，我向他们描述了我们这个世界的智慧，告诉他们说，学术上的声望所仰赖的知识分支中就包括分析学，他们忙于以分析学来探究属心智及其思想的东西，称其为形而上学和逻辑学。不过，我说，除了使用术语和某些可变规则外，他们几乎没什么进步；他们争论这些术语，如什么是形式，什么是物质，什么是心智，什么是灵魂；还通过这些可变的一般规则激烈争论真理。听到所有这一切，来自另一星球的这些灵人发现，当人们执着于诸如术语这类事物，并通过精心构建规则来思想这些事时，它们就会夺走对事物的一切感觉和理解力。<br />他们说，这类术语和规则不过是些小小的乌云，它们遮挡了人的精神视觉，将理解力拽下来，可以说拽到了尘埃里。他们补充说，他们不是这样；由于不了解什么分析学，根本不知道这类术语和规则，他们反而对事物有更清晰的概念。我还被允许看到他们何等智慧。他们以神奇的方式将人类心智呈现为天堂的形式，将其情感呈现为与该形式一致的活动气场。他们做得如此巧妙，以至于得到了天使的赞美。他们还描绘了主如何将这些本身并不令人愉快的情感折向那类令人愉快的。<br />我们地球上的一些学者也在场，但他们一点也看不懂这些代表，尽管在世时他们曾就这类主题进行了大量哲学讨论。当这些灵人察觉到他们的思维，以及他们如何执着于纯粹的术语，并倾向于争论每一个事物的真相时，他们将这类努力称为充满渣滓的泡沫。</p>

Spirits from another earth were with me for a considerable time; and I described to them the wisdom of our globe, and told them that among the sciences pursued by the learned is that of analytics, with 
which they busy themselves in exploring what is of the mind and its thoughts, calling it metaphysics and logic. But I said that men have advanced little beyond terms, and certain shifting rules; and 
that they argue concerning these terms-as what form is; what substance; what the mind; and what the soul; and that by means of these general shifting rules they vehemently dispute about truths. I then 
perceived from these spirits that when men inhere in such things as terms, and think concerning these matters by artificial rules, they take away all sense and understanding of a subject. [2] They 
said that such things are merely little black clouds interposed before the intellectual sight; and that they drag down the understanding into the dust. They added that with them it is not so, but that 
they have clearer ideas of things in consequence of being unacquainted with such analytics. I was also permitted to see how wise they are. They represented the human mind in a marvelous manner as a 
heavenly form; and its affections as spheres of activity in agreement with it; and this so skillfully that they were commended by the angels. They represented also in what manner the Lord bends those 
affections which in themselves are not delightful, into such as are delightful. [3] Learned men of our earth were present, and could not in the least comprehend these things, although in the life of 
the body they had discoursed much on such subjects in a philosophical way; and when the spirits just referred to in turn perceived their thoughts, in that they inhered in mere terms, and were inclined 
to dispute on every point as to whether it is so, they called such things feculent froth. </p>

Spirits from another planet were once present with me for quite a long while, during which time I told them about the wisdom of our world I described to them how included among the branches of knowledge 
in which the reputation for being learned rests is that of analytics, by means of which men strive to examine closely the things that comprise the mind and its thoughts, and how they call this branch 
of knowledge metaphysics and logic, and yet they do not get very far beyond the use of terms or of a few general, yet variable, rules. I went on to describe how they argue over terms, asking for example, 
What is meant by a form, or by substance, or by the mind, or by the soul? And how by means of those variable general rules they engaged in acrimonious disputes over truths. Hearing all this those 
spirits from another planet perceived that such things remove all sense and understanding of a thing when people stick to terms and think about such by means of carefully constructed rules. They said 
that such terms and rules were merely little black clouds which blocked one's mental vision and lowered the understanding so to speak down into the dust. They added that it was not so among them, 
but that they had clearer ideas of things through having no knowledge at all of such terms and rules. I was also allowed to see how wise they were. They represented the human mind in a wonderful way as 
a heavenly form, and its affections as spheres of activity in keeping with that form. They effected this representation so deftly that the angels praised them for it. They also represented how the Lord 
bends those affections which are not in themselves delightful into those that are. Learned ones from our earth were present but they were unable to understand these representations in the slightest 
even though during their lifetime they had engaged in much philosophical discussion. When those from another planet perceived their thoughts and how they stuck solely to terms and were inclined to dispute 
the truth of every single thing they called such endeavours a froth full of dregs. </p>

Erant spiritus ex alia tellure apud me satis diu, quibus cum narrarem sapientiam nostri orbis, quod inter scientias ex quibus eruditi audiunt, etiam sint analytica per quae explorare satagunt illa quae 
mentis sunt et ejus cogitationum, et quod vocent illa metaphysica et logica, sed quod parum ultra terminos, et aliquot regulas communes versatiles, progressum fecerint; et quod de terminis litigent, 
ut quid forma, quid substantia, quid mens, quid anima, et quod per regulas illas communes versatiles acriter disputent de veris: {1}tunc ab illis perceptum quod talia abstrahant omnem rei sensum et 
intellectum, quando illis ut terminis inhaerent, ac de illis per artificiosas regulas cogitant; dicebant talia esse modo nigras nubeculas, quae objiciuntur visui intellectuali, et quod detrahant intellectum 
in pulverem; addebant quod apud illos non ita sit, sed quod rerum ideas clariores habeant per id quod nihil de talibus sciant: videre etiam datum quam sapientes essent; repraesentabant mirabiliter 
mentem humanum ut formam caelestem, et ejus affectiones ut activitatis sphaeras (c)illi convenientes, et hoc tam dextre ut collaudati sint ab angelis; repraesentabant etiam quomodo Dominus affectiones 
illas quae in se injucundae sunt, flectat in jucundas; docti nostrae telluris aderant, nec hilum potuerunt comprehendere, tametsi de talibus philosophice multum in vita corporis locuti sunt; illi 
cum iterum perciperent {2}eorum cogitationes, quod modo inhaererent terminis, ac inclinarent ad disputandum de singulis num ita sit, vocabant talia spumas faeculentas. @1 sed$  @2 A d eorum, i horum$  </p>
