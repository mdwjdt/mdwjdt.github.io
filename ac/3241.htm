<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3241.</strong>“底但的子孙是亚书利族、利都是族和利乌米族”表来自第二类的衍生物。这从“底但”的代表清楚可知，“底但”是指那些处于信之良善的人，准确来说是指那些处于源自良善的信之真理的人（<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>节）。显然，这些衍生物来自第二类。底但的这三个儿子尤表源于良善的信之真理，尽管每一个的含义的确能被阐述出来，但却无法通过圣言中的其它经文来确认，因为经上再没提及这些名字。<br />主国度中的良善与真理有无数种，然而，这无数种却构成一个天堂。事实上，这些种类如此之多，以致没有哪两个社群是一样的，也就是说，没有哪两个社群处在相同的良善与真理中（<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="690.htm">690</a>节）。那里一个天堂就由许多差别（variations）组成，主按照使其一致的方式排列这些差别。许多差别的这种一致或和谐由主通过它们各自与祂的关系而实现（<a href="551.htm">551</a>节）。此中情形和人体的器官、肢体、脏腑是一样的，它们当中没有哪两个是相同的。然而，尽管它们各不相同，却构成一体。这是因为它们全都与一个灵魂，并通过该灵魂与天堂、因而与主有关系。凡与主没有关系的，什么都不是。由此可见，真理与良善在种类上的不同（differences）是不计其数的。它们的属（genera），事实上最一般的属（它们属于属灵教会）由亚伯拉罕与基土拉的这些儿子和孙子来表示。<br />由于属灵教会成员不像属天教会成员那样拥有对何为良善与真理的直觉，相反却承认他们所学到的东西是真理，所以他们不断争论它们，推理事情是否真实。每个人都执着于自己的教会所支持的教义，并视之为真理。这就是如此多的差别的源头。此外，绝大多数人以各自不同的方式根据表象和错觉形成有关良善与真理的结论。但没有人通过任何直觉这样做，他们甚至不知道何为直觉。由于他们在信之良善与真理方面的理解力如此昏暗，所以在信的一切事物中最基本的真理，也就是说，在神性、人性，以及主的神圣行动（Holy proceeding）方面存在分歧也就不奇怪了。属天之人直觉这些不是三，而是一；但属灵之人尽管愿意认为它们是一，却仍持有三的形像。既然在这最基本的真理方面都存在分歧，那么可见在教义问题上的差别和不同（variations and differences）必定不计其数。由此可知此处这些人名所表示的衍生物的来源。不过，尽管在教义问题上有这么多的差别和不同，或有这么多的衍生物，但当人人都承认仁爱是教会的本质，或也可说，人人都视生活为教义的目的，也就是人人都询问作为教会的一员该如何生活，而不是询问他持何种观点时，它们仍一起形成一个教会。因为在来世，每个人都根据自己生活的良善，而非脱离良善生活的教义真理而从主接受指定给他的地方。</p>

And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. That this signifies the derivations from the second class, is evident from the representation of Dedan, as being those who are in the good 
of faith, properly those who are in the truth of faith from good (n. 3240, at the end). That the derivations are from a second class is manifest. By these three sons of Dedan are especially signified 
the truths of faith from good; but what is signified by each can indeed be told, but cannot be confirmed by other passages from the Word, because the names are not mentioned elsewhere.  [2] In the 
kingdom of the Lord there are innumerable varieties as to goods and truths, and yet of these innumerable varieties one heaven is constituted; for the varieties are so many that no one society is exactly 
like another, that is, is never in the same good and truth (n. 684, 685, 690). The one heaven therein is constituted of the many varieties so disposed by the Lord that they agree, the agreement or 
harmony of the many being imparted by the Lord, by means of all referring themselves to Him (n. 551). The case herein is the same as with the organs, members, and viscera of the body, not one of which 
is exactly like another. They are all different and yet make a one, and this by reason of their all referring themselves to one soul, and through this to heaven, and thus to the Lord; for whatever 
is unconnected with the Lord is nothing. From this it is evident that the differences of truth and of good are innumerable in species; but their genera, and these the most general, which are spiritual 
churches, are signified by these sons and grandsons of Abraham.  [3] As they who are of the spiritual church have no perception of what is good and true, like those of the celestial church, but acknowledge 
as truths the things they have learned, they are on this account continually in dispute concerning them, reasoning whether a thing is true; and each person abides in that doctrine (and calls it 
true) which is of his own church. This is the source of so many differences. Moreover very many form their conclusions concerning things good and true from appearances and fallacies-one in one way, 
another in another, but none from any perception; they do not even know what perception is; and as their understanding is thus in obscurity as to the goods and truths of faith, it is not surprising that 
dissensions should arise concerning the most essential of all the things of faith, namely, concerning the Divine, the Human, and the Holy Proceeding of the Lord. The celestial perceive that these are 
not three, but One; but the spiritual abide in the idea of three, although they desire to think that they are One. Seeing then that there are dissensions concerning that which is the most essential, 
it is evident that the varieties and differences of doctrinal things must be innumerable. From this all may know whence come the derivations signified by those who are here named. But granting the existence 
of so many varieties and differences of doctrinal things (that is, of so many derivations), they nevertheless together form one church when all acknowledge charity as essential to the church; 
or what is the same, when they regard life as the end of doctrine; that is, when they inquire how the man of the church lives, and not so much what his sentiments are; for in the other life everyone 
receives from the Lord a lot in accordance with his good of life, and not in accordance with his truth of doctrine separated from the good of life. </p>

'And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim' means the derivatives from the second division. This becomes clear from the representation of 'sedan' as those governed by the good of 
faith, or to be precise, those governed by the truth of faith derived from good, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a> (end). The fact that they are derivatives from the second division is self-evident. These three sons mean in particular 
the truths of faith derived from good, though just what each one means can indeed be stated but not confirmed from elsewhere in the Word since they are not mentioned again. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the Lord's 
kingdom there are countless variations to goods and truths, yet all those countless variations make up one heaven. Indeed there are so many that one community is in no sense exactly like another, that 
is, governed by the same good and truth, see <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="690.htm">690</a>. One heaven there is made up of many varying parts arranged by the Lord in such a way that they all accord. This accordance or harmony of the 
many is effected by the Lord through the relationship which each of them has to Him, <a href="551.htm">551</a>. It is like the organs, members, and viscera of the body. None is exactly like another. Yet although they are 
all different from one another they nevertheless make one, through the relatedness of them all to one soul, and through this soul to heaven and so to the Lord. For anything that has no connection with 
the Lord is in reality nothing. From this it may be seen that specific differences in truth and good are countless. But the kinds of these, indeed the most general kinds, which belong to the spiritual 
Church, are meant by these sons and grandsons of Abraham by Keturah. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because members of the spiritual Church do not have perception, as those of the celestial Church do, of what good and truth 
are, but instead acknowledge as truths things which they have had to learn, they are therefore constantly engaged in discussion about them and in reasoning whether they are true. Everybody adheres 
to the teaching which his own Church upholds and calls it the truth. This is what gives rise to so many differences. Furthermore the majority make their minds up about goods and truths from appearances 
and illusions - each one in a different way from another. But no one does so from any perception; indeed they do not know what perception is. Since their understanding is so darkened as regards goods 
and truths of faith, it is no wonder that disagreements exist about the most essential truth of all, that is to say, about the Lord's Divine, His Human, and His Holy proceeding from these. Those who 
are celestial perceive that these are not three but one, but in the case of those who are spiritual a mental image of three remains, though they are willing to think of them as one. Since therefore 
disagreements exist regarding this most essential truth, it may be seen that the variations and differences in matters of doctrine are countless. From this one may know the origin of the derivatives meant 
by the names of those mentioned at this point. But although there are so many variations and differences in matters of doctrine, or so many derivatives, nevertheless they all together form one Church 
when everyone acknowledges charity to be the essential thing of the Church, or what amounts to the same, when everyone regards life as the end in view of doctrine - that is, when everyone asks, How 
does a member of the Church live? rather than, What does he think? For in the next life everyone is allotted a place by the Lord that accords with the good constituting his life, not with the truth 
he knows from doctrine separated from that good. </p>

`Et filii Dedanis fuerunt Asshurim, et Letushim, et Leummim':  quod significet ab altera sorte derivationes, constare potest ea repraesentatione `Dedanis' quod sint illi qui in fidei bono, proprie qui 
in fidei vero ex bono, n. 3240 fin.: quod ex altera sorte derivationes sint, patet: sunt imprimis fidei vera ex bono quae per tres illos significantur; at quid per {1}unumquemvis, quidem dici potest, 
sed non confirmari per Verbum alibi, nam non amplius memorantur. [2] In regno Domini sunt innumerabiles varietates quoad bona et vera, ex innumerabilibus illis usque unum caelum constituitur; sunt 
enim tot varietates ut nusquam una societas sit prorsus similis alteri, hoc est, in eodem bono ac vero, videatur n. 684, 685, 690; unum ibi constituitur ex pluribus variis ita a Domino dispositis ut concordent; 
concordantia seu harmonia plurium inditur a Domino per quod omnes se ad Ipsum referant, n. 551; se habet hoc sicut organa, (t)membra et viscera corporis, illorum nullum est prorsus simile alteri, 
sed omnia inter se varia at usque unum faciunt, et quidem per id quod Omnia referant se ad unam animam, et per hanc ad caelum, et sic ad Dominum; nam omne inconnexum a Domino est nihil inde constare 
potest quod differentiae veri et boni in specie innumerabiles sint; sed genera illorum, et quidem communissima, quae sunt {2}Ecclesiae spiritualis, significantur per hos filios et nepotes Abrahami{3}. 
 [3] Qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, quia nullam perceptionem habent, sicut qui ab Ecclesia caelesti, quid bonum et verum, sed quae didicerunt, pro veris agnoscunt, ideo continue in lite sunt 
de illis, ac ratiocinantur num ita sit, ac unusquisque manet in illo doctrinali, (c)et vocat verum, quod ejus Ecclesiae est, inde tot differentiae sunt; praeter quod plerique concludant de bonis et veris 
ab apparentiis et fallaciis, unus dissimiliter ac alter, sed nullus ex aliqua perceptione, immo quid perceptio, {4}non sciunt: quia intellectus illorum ita obscuratus est quoad bona et vera fidei, 
non mirum est quod dissensiones {5}sint de omnium essentialissimo, nempe de Domini Divino, Humano, (c)et Sancto procedente; caelestes percipiunt quod non tria sint sed unum, spirituales autem manent 
in idea trium, at volunt ut cogitent quod sint unum; cum itaque de essentialissimo dissensiones {6}sunt, constare potest quod doctrinalium varietates et differentiae innumerabiles sint{7}; inde sciri 
potest unde derivationes quae significantur per illos qui hic nominantur: at licet tot varietates et differentiae doctrinalium sunt, seu tot derivationes, usque tamen simul unam formant Ecclesiam quando 
omnes charitatem pro essentiali Ecclesiae agnoscunt, seu quod idem, quando vitam spectant ut finem doctrinae, hoc est, quaerunt quomodo homo Ecclesiae vivit, non ita quomodo sentit, nam quisque secundum 
vitae bonum non secundum doctrinae verum {8}a vitae bono separatum, donatur a Domino {9}sorte in altera vita. @1 unumquemque$  @2 Regni spiritualis A, Ecclesiae spirituales I$  @3 i ex Keturah$
