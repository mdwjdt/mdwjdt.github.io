<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>113.</strong>在圣经中，“金子”被用来指智之良善或爱之良善，这是十分普遍的。约柜、圣殿、桌子、灯台、各样器皿及亚伦服饰上的金子都是象征智之良善或爱之良善。在先知书中也是，例如：“你靠自己的智慧聪明得了金银财宝，收入库中。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.4.htm">28:4</a>）此处明确表示“金银”出于智慧与聪明，或说良善与真理，因为“银”在此表真理，约柜上和圣殿中的银子亦复如是。<br />又如：“成群的骆驼并米甸和以法的独峰驼必遮满你，示巴的众人都必来到，要奉上黄金乳香，又要传说耶和华的赞美。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.6.htm">60:6</a>）<br />再如东方的智者，当耶稣降生时来俯伏拜他，他们“揭开宝盒，拿黄金、乳香、没药为礼物献给他”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.11.htm">11</a>）。在此，“黄金”也是表良善，“乳香和没药”表可喜之物，因为它们出于爱与信，也因此被称为“耶和华的赞美”。故诗篇上说：“他们要存活，示巴的金子要奉给他。人要常常为他祷告，终日称颂他。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.15.htm">72:15</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]113.</strong> Nothing is more common in the Word than for gold to symbolize and represent the goodness that belongs to wisdom or to love. All the gold used for the ark, the Temple, the golden table, the lampstands, the utensils, and Aaron's garments had this symbolism and representation.{*1} The prophets use gold in a similar way. In Ezekiel, for instance:<br />In your wisdom and in your understanding you made yourself riches, and you made gold and silver for your treasuries. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_4" target=_top>Ezekiel 28:4</a>)<br />This explicitly states that gold and silver (goodness and truth) come from wisdom and understanding. Silver here symbolizes truth, as does the silver in the tabernacle and the Temple.{*2} In Isaiah:<br />A horde of camels will blanket you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; they will all come from Sheba. Gold and frankincense they will carry, and Jehovah's praises they will proclaim. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_6" target=_top>Isaiah 60:6</a>)<br />The sages from the East did the same when they came to Jesus at his birth and fell on their faces and worshiped him:<br />And they opened their treasure chests and offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_1" target=_top>Matthew 2:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_11" target=_top>11</a>)<br />Here too gold symbolizes goodness. Frankincense and myrrh symbolize things that are pleasing [to the Lord], because they spring from love and faith. This is why they are called "Jehovah's praises." So in David it says:<br />And [the poor] will live, and [God] will give them some of Sheba's gold and pray for them continually; every day he will bless them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_15" target=_top>Psalms 72:15</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} It is possible that "Temple" (templo) here is an error for "tabernacle" (tabernaculo), because the other items listed, and especially Aaron's garments, are more closely associated with the tabernacle than with Solomon's temple. But see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113" target=_top>113</a> as well. By the tabernacle here Swedenborg would mean specifically the main tent, or "dwelling place." For the use of gold in the tabernacle, its furniture, and Aaron's garments, see Exodus 25, 26, 28, 30. For its use in Solomon's temple, see 1 Kings 6, 7; 1 Chronicles 28, 29; 2 Chronicles 3, 4. [LHC]<br />{*2} The translation here is based on reading Tabernaculo (tabernacle) for Arca (ark), as suggested in the third Latin edition. See Exodus 26, 27 for the use of silver in the tabernacle. See 1 Chronicles 28, 29 for its use in the Temple. It is worth noting, however, that in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_296" target=_top>296</a> Swedenborg treats the ark as standing for the structure in which it was housed; the discussion of the ark there starts off with a description of the coverings for the dwelling place and proceeds through all the other furniture and the utensils. This may also explain the difficulty discussed in note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113" target=_top>113</a> just above. A similar problem occurs in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_113/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2784" target=_top>2784</a>. [LHC] </p>

Nothing is more common in the Word than for the good of wisdom or of love to be signified and represented by "gold." All the gold in the ark, in the temple, in the golden table, in the candlestick, in 
the vessels, and upon the garments of Aaron, signified and represented the good of wisdom or of love. So also in the Prophets, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     In thy wisdom and in thine intelligence thou hast 
gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver in thy treasures (Ezek. 18:4),  where it is plainly said that from wisdom and intelligence are "gold and silver" or the good and the true, for " silver 
here signifies truth, as it does also in the ark and in the temple. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come, 
they shall bring gold and incense, and they shall show forth the praises of Jehovah (Isa. 60:6). Thus also: </p>
<p>     The wise men from the east, who came to Jesus when He was born, fell down and worshiped 
Him; and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:1, 11). Here also "gold" signifies good; "frankincense and myrrh" things that 
are grateful because from love and faith, and which are therefore called "the praises of Jehovah." Wherefore it is said in David: </p>
<p>     He shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; 
prayer also shall be made for him continually, and every day shall He bless him (Ps. 72:15). </p>

Nothing is more common in the Word than for the good that belongs to wisdom or else to love to be meant and represented by 'gold'. All the gold of the Ark, the Temple, the golden table,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the lampstands, 
the vessels, and on Aaron's vestments, meant and represented good that belongs to wisdom or else to love. Similarly in the Prophets, as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
In your wisdom and in your intelligence have 
made wealth for yourself, and you have made gold and silver in your treasures. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:4</a>.

Here it is plainly stated that gold and silver, or good and truth, are the products of wisdom and intelligence, 
for 'silver' here means truth, as also does the silver of the Tabernacle<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and the Temple. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
A multitude of camels will cover you, dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, all those from 
Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and will proclaim the praises of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:6</a>.

So too the wise men from the east who came to Jesus after His birth,   And they fell 
down and worshipped Him, and they opened their treasures, and offered Him gifts - gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:1,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2:1, 11</a>.   Here also 'gold' means good, 'frankincense and myrrh' those things that 
are pleasing, because they derive from love and faith, and are consequently called 'the praises of Jehovah'. 'Gold' is for the same reason mentioned in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
He will live, and He will give to 
him from the gold of Sheba, and will pray for him continually, and bless him every day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2072:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 72:15</a>.

Quod bonum sapientiae aut amoris significatum et repraesentatam sit per 'aurum,' nihil communius est in Verbo; omne aurum in arca, in templo, in mensa aurea, in candelabris, in vasis, super vestibus 
Aharonis, significabant et repraesentabant bonum sapientiae aut amoris: similiter apud Prophetas, ut apud Ezechielem, 	In sapientia tua, et in intelligentia tua, fecisti tibi opes, fecisti aurum et 
argentum in thesauris tuis, xxviii 4; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste dicitur quod ex sapientia et intelligentia aurum argentum, seu bonum et verum, nam 'argentum' ibi significat verum, ut quoque argentum in arca {1} 
et in templo: apud Esaiam, 	Copia camelorum obteget te, dromades Midianis et Ephae omnes ii e Sheba, venient, aurum et tus portabunt, et laudes Jehovae annuntiabunt, lx 6: </p>
<p>sicut etiam sapientes ex oriente 
qui veniebant ad Jesum cum natus, 	Et procidebant et adorabant Ipsum, et aperiebant thesauros suos, et offerebant Ipsi dona, aurum, tus et myrrham, Matth. ii 1, 11; </p>
<p>ubi quoque 'aurum' significat 
bonum; 'tus et myrrha,' illa quae grata sunt quia ex amore et fide, quae ideo dicuntur 'laudes Jehovae.' Qua apud Davidem, 	Vivet, et dabit illi de auro Shebae, et orabit pro illo jugiter, omni die 
benedicet illi, Ps. lxxii 15. @  1 Probably this should be tabernaculo to pair with templo.$
