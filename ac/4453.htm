<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4453节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4453.</strong>“做买卖，置产业”表因他们交流而将彼此一致的教义。这从“做买卖”和“置产业”的含义清楚可知：“做买卖”是指为自己获取认知，以及交流它们（参看<a href="2967.htm">2967</a>节），因此在这地“做买卖”表示进入哈抹的儿子示剑及其城所表示的良善与真理的认知；“置产业”是指合一，因而是指彼此一致。“做买卖”之所以表示为自己获取认知，以及交流它们，是因为在天上，就是照内义觉悟圣言的地方，是没有买卖的；事实上，天上没有金、银，或诸如在这个世上用来交易的那类事物；因此，当我们在圣言中读到“买卖”（trading，或译贸易，交易等）时，是以灵义来理解的，在天上被感知为与“买卖”（trading，或译贸易，交易等）相对应的某种事物，一般来说，是认知的获取和交流，具体来说是所提到的物体所指的实体。例如，若提到“金”，就理解为爱与智慧的良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）；若提到“银”，就理解为属于聪明和信仰的真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）；若提到人们在古时用来交易的 “母绵羊”、“公绵羊”、“小山羊”或“羔羊”，就理解为诸如这些动物所表示的那类事物，等等。<br />如以西结书：<br />告诉推罗，你居住海口，跟众民到许多海岛交易；他施人因你多有各类的财物，就作你的客商，拿银、铁、锡、铅兑换你的货物。雅完人、土巴人、米设人都用人口与你交易，拿铜器兑换你的商品。底但人与你交易；许多海岛成了你手里的货品。亚兰人因你的手工艺品很多，就作你的客商；犹大和以色列地的人都与你交易；他们用米匿的麦子、饼、蜜、油、乳香兑换你的商品。大马色人因你的手工艺品很多，又因你多有各类的财物，就拿黑本酒和沙哈（Zahar）羊毛与你交易。威但人和雅完人拿纺成的线兑换你的货物。底但人用马车的敞篷与你交易。亚拉伯人和基达的一切首领都作你手下的客商，用羊羔、公绵羊、公山羊与你交易。示巴和拉玛的商人与你交易，他们用各类上好的香料、各类的宝石和黄金兑换你的货物。哈兰人、干尼人、伊甸人、示巴的商人和亚述人、基抹人与你交易。这些商人以美好的货物与你交易，用蓝色包袱，刺绣的衣服；盛华丽衣服香柏木的宝箱，用绳捆着兑换你的货物。他施的船只接连成帮为你运货，你便在海心丰满，极其荣华。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.3.htm">27:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.25.htm">25</a>）<br />由此处和圣言中的许多其它经文明显可知，“交易”、“商品”、“货品”和“货物”无非是指与良善并真理的认知有关的事物。因为若非推罗的交易活动表示属灵和属天的事物，预言的圣言与这些活动有什么相干呢？既如此，那么显而易见，不仅“货物”表示其它事物，而且此处所提到的民族也表示拥有这些其它事物的人民。还显而易见，若不凭内义，没有人知道所有这些表示什么；如不知道他施、雅完人、土巴人、米设人、底但人、亚兰人、犹大、以色列、威但人、雅完、底但人、阿拉伯人、示巴、拉玛、哈兰人、干尼人、伊甸人、亚述人、基抹人表示什么；也不知道他们的货物表示什么，如银、铁、锡、铅、铜器、麦子、米匿、饼、蜜、油、乳香、黑本酒、沙哈羊毛、纺成的线、马车敞篷、羊羔、公绵羊、公山羊、香料、宝石、黄金、蓝色包袱、刺绣的衣服、捆绳、香柏木制成的物件。这些及类似事物表示教会和主国度的良善与真理，以及对这些良善与真理的认知。正因推罗表示认知（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节），所以此处论述的主题是推罗。由于这类财物，也就是良善与真理，就存在于主的教会和国度中，故表示主的教会和国度的迦南地自上古时代就具有一个源于表示货物或货品的词的名字，因为这就是原文中“迦南”这个名的含义。综上所述，明显可知在这地“做买卖”是什么意思。</p>

And range through it trading, and get you possession therein. That this signifies doctrinal tenets from what is general that would agree together, is evident from the signification of "trading," as being 
to acquire knowledges for one's self, and also to communicate them (see n. 2967), hence "to range through the land trading" denotes to enter into the knowledges of good and truth signified by Shechem 
the son of Hamor and his city; and from the signification of "getting possession therein," as being to make one, thus to agree together, for they who possess a land together, make one and agree. 
That "to trade" denotes to acquire knowledges, and also to communicate them, is because in heaven, where the Word is perceived according to its internal sense, there is no trading, for in heaven there 
is no gold, silver, or anything else such as are traded with in this world; and therefore when we read in the Word of "trading," this is understood in a spiritual sense, and there is perceived something 
that corresponds to trading, which-to speak generally-is the acquisition and communication of knowledges, and specifically, is that [which is indicated by the object] named. Thus, if "gold" is named, 
the good of love and wisdom is understood (n. 113, 1551, 1552); if "silver," the truth which is of intelligence and faith (n. 1551, 2048, 2954); if "sheep," "rams," "kids," or "lambs," in which they 
traded in ancient times, such things are understood as these animals signify, and so on. 
 </p>
<p>[2] As in Ezekiel: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entrances of the sea, the trader of the 
peoples unto many isles, Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; in silver, in iron, in tin and lead they furnished thy fairs. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, these were 
thy traders in the soul of man, and in vessels of brass they furnished thy commerce. The sons of Dedan were thy traders, many isles were the merchandise of thine hand. Syria was thy merchant in the 
multitude of thy works. Judah and the land of Israel, these were thy traders in wheat, minnith, and pannag, and in honey and oil and balm they furnished thy commerce. Damascus was thy merchant in the 
multitude of thy works, by reason of the multitude of all riches, in wine of Heshbon and wool of Zachar. Dan and Javan furnished yarn in thy fairs. Dedan was thy trader in garments of freedom for the 
chariot. The Arabian and all the princes of Kedar, these were the merchants of thy hand, in lambs and rams and he-goats, in these were they thy merchants. The traders of Shebah and Raamah, these were 
thy traders in the chief of all spice and by every precious stone and gold they furnished thy tradings. Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur, Chilmad was thy trader. These were thy 
traders with perfections, with balls of blue, and broidered work; and with treasures of precious garments bound with cords and in cedar they were in thy merchandise; whence thou hast been filled and 
become honored exceedingly in the heart of the seas (Ezek. 27:3, 12-13, 15-19, 21-25). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[3] From this and many other passages in the Word it appears that "tradings," "commerce," "merchandise," and "wares," 
are nothing else than things which relate to the knowledges of good and truth. For what has the prophetic Word to do with the tradings of Tyre unless things spiritual and celestial are signified 
by them? And because this is so, it must be very evident not only that by the wares are other things signified, but also that by the nation there named are signified those possessed of these other things; 
and that except from the internal sense it cannot be known what all these signify, as for instance what is signified by "Tarshish," "Javan," "Tubal," "Meshech," the "sons of Dedan," "Syria," "Judah," 
"Israel," "Dan," "Javan," "Dedan," the "Arabian," "Sheba," "Raamah," "Haran," "Canneh," "Eden," "Assyria," "Chilmad;" and also what is signified by their wares, such as "silver," "iron," "tin," 
"lead," "vessels of brass," "wheat," "minnith," "pannag," "honey," "oil," "balm," "wine of Heshbon," "wool of Zachar," "yarn," "garments of freedom for the chariot," "lambs," "rams," "he-goats," "spice," 
"precious stone," "gold," "balls of blue," "broidered work," "cords bound," and "cedar." These and the like things signify the goods and truths of the church and the Lord's kingdom, and also the knowledges 
of these goods and truths. It is for this reason that Tyre is here treated of, because by "Tyre" are signified knowledges (n. 1201). And because such wares, that is, goods and truths, are in 
the Lord's church and kingdom, the land of Canaan (which signifies the Lord's church and kingdom) bore from the most ancient time a name that is derived from "wares" or "merchandise," for such is the 
meaning of the name "Canaan" in the original language. From all that has been said it is now evident what is signified by "ranging through the land trading."
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4453</b></p>
<p><b>4453.</b>&nbsp; 'Carry on trade 
throughout it, and have possessions in it' means matters of doctrine which, 
because they are communicated, would accord with one another. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'carrying on trade&quot; as acquiring cognitions for oneself and also 
communicating them, dealt with in <a href="2967.htm">2967</a> - 'carrying on 
trade throughout the land' therefore meaning entering into the cognitions of 
good and truth which Shechem the son of Hamor and his city mean; and from the 
meaning of 'having possession of a land make one and accord with one another. 
The reason why 'carrying on trade' means acquiring cognitions for oneself and 
also communicating them is that in heaven, where the Word is perceived, which in 
general is the acquisition and communication of cognitions, and specifically the 
reality meant my whatever commodity is mentioned. For example, if gold is 
mentioned, the good of love and wisdom is understood, <a href="113.htm">113</a>,
<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, 1552; if silver, the truth that belongs to 
intelligence and faith, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>,
<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>. If mention if made of sheep, rams, kids, or lambs 
with which people traded in ancient times, the kinds of things meant by sheep, 
rams, kids and lambs are understood; and so on. 
<p>[2] As in Ezekiel, 
<blockquote>
	<p>Say to Tyre, one that dwells 
	upon the entrances of the seas, that she is the trader of the peoples to 
	many islands: Tarshish was your merchant because of the abundance of all 
	riches; silver, iron, tin, and lead, they exchanged for your wares. Javan, 
	Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traders in the souls of men - and they 
	gave vessels of bronze for your commerce. The sons of Dedan were your 
	traders; many islands were the merchandise of your hand. Syria was your 
	merchant in the multitude of your handiworks; Judah, and the land of Israel, 
	they were your traders. Wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, 
	and balm they exchanged for your commerce. Damascus was your merchant in the 
	multitude of your handiworks, because of the multitude of all riches - in 
	the wine of Helbon, and the wool of Zahar. Dan and Javan traded with yarn 
	for your wares. Dedan was your trader in chariot cloaks.<sup>1</sup> . The Arab and 
	all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of your hand, in lambs, and 
	rams, and goats; in these were they your merchants. The traders of Sheba and 
	Raamah, they were your traders in the best of every spice; and by means of 
	every precious stone and gold they provided your tradings. Haran and Canneh 
	and Eden, the traders of Sheba; Asshur, Chilmad, was your trader. These were 
	your traders in choice wares - balls of violet, and embroidered garments; 
	and treasure-chests of precious garments, bound cords, and objects made of 
	cedar were among your merchandise. The ships of Tarshish were your squadrons 
	in your merchandise from which you have been filled and made exceedingly 
	honoured in the heart of the seas. Ezekiel 27:1-25. 
</blockquote>
<p>[3] From here and many other paces 
in the Word it may be seen that tradings, commerce, merchandise, and wares mean 
nothing other than undertakings involving cognitions of good and truth. For what 
connection can the prophetical Word have with the trading activities of Tyre 
unless they mean things that are spiritual and celestial? That being so, it is 
quite clear not only that things other than wares are meant by 'wares' but also 
that the nations mentioned by name there mean people among whom these other 
things reside. It is also clear that no one can know what is meant by any of 
them except from the internal sense - what is meant by Tarshish, Javan, Tubal, 
Meshech, the sons of Dedan, Syria, Judah, Israel, Dan, Javan, Dedan, the Arab, 
Shebah, Raamah, Haran, Canneh, Eden, Asshur, and Chilmad. Nor can one know what 
is meant by their wares - by silver, iron, tin, lead, vessels of bronze, wheat, 
minnith, pannag, honey, oil, balm, the wine of Helbon, the wool of Zahar, yarn, 
chariot-cloaks, lambs, rams, goats, spices, precious stones, gold, balls of 
violet embroidered garments, bound cords, and objects made of cedar. These and 
others like them mean the goods and truths of the Church and of the Lord's 
kingdom, and the cognitions of those goods and truths. It is because Tyre means 
cognitions, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>, that Tyre is the subject at this point 
in Ezekiel. And because such 'wares', that is, goods and truths, exist in the 
Church and the Lord's kingdom, the land of Canaan, which means the Church and 
the Lord's kingdom, was from most ancient times so named from a word meaning 
wares or merchandise, for this is what the name Canaan means in the original 
language. From all this one may now see what is meant by 'carrying on trade 
throughout the land'. <br>

`Negotiando pervagamini eam, et possidete in ea': quod significet dogmata ex communi quod consensura, constat ex significatione `negotiari' quod sit cognitiones sibi comparare, et quoque communicare, 
de qua n. 2967, inde `negotiando pervagari terram' est intrare in cognitiones boni et veri quae per Shechemum filium Hamoris et per urbem ejus significantur; et a significatione `possidere in 
ea' quod sit unum facere, ita consentire, qui enim simul terram possident, illi unum faciunt et consentiunt.  Quod `negotiari' sit cognitiones sibi comparare et quoque communicare, est quia in caelo 
ubi Verbum percipitur secundum sensum internum, non detur aliqua negotiatio, non enim ibi {1} aurum, nec argentum, nec talia cum quibus in mundo negotiantur, quapropter cum `negotiari' legitur in 
Verbo, intelligitur id in sensu spirituali, et tale percipitur quod correspondet, in genere comparatio et communicatio cognitionum et in specie illud quod nominatur; ut si aurum nominatur, intelligitur 
bonum amoris et sapientiae, n. 113, 1551, 1552; si argentum, intelligitur verum quod intelligentiae et fidei, n. 1551, 2048, 2954; si oves, arietes, haedi, agni, per quae antiquitus negotiati 
sunt, intelliguntur talia quae oves, arietes, haedi, et agni significant, et sic porro; [2] sicut apud Ezechielem,           Dic Tyro, habitatrix super introitibus maris,      Negotiatrix populorum 
ad insulas multas:... Tarshish      mercatrix tua ex multitudine omnium opum, in argento, in      ferro, in stanno et plumbo, dederunt nundinationes tuas.       (x)Javan, Tubal, et Meshech, hi negotiatores 
tui, in anima      hominis, et vasis aeris, dederunt commercium tuum.... Filii      Dedanis negotiatores tui; insulae multae mercatura manus      tuae.... Syria mercatrix tua in multitudine 
operum      tuorum.... Jehudah et terra Israelis, illi negotiatores tui      in triticis, minnith {2}, et (x)pannag, et melle et oleo, et      opobalsamo, dederunt commercium tuum. Damascus mercatrix 
tua      in multitudine operum tuorum ex multitudine omnium opum, in      vino Helbonis {3} et lana Zaharis {4}.  Dan {5} et Javan      netum in nundinationibus tuis dederunt.... Dedan negotiatrix  
    tua in vestibus libertatis ad currum.  Arabs et omnes      principes Kedar, illi mercatores manus tuae, in agnis et      arietibus et hircis, in his mercatores tui.  Negotiatores     
 Shebae et Raamae, illi negotiatores tui in primario omnis      aromatis; et per omnem lapidem pretiosum et aurum, dederunt      negotiationes tuas.  Haran et Canneh {6} et Eden,      negotiatores 
Shebae, Asshur, Kilmad negotiatrix tua.  Hi      negotiatores tui cum perfectionibus, cum glomeribus      hyacinthi {7}, et acupicto, et cum thesauris vestium      pretiosarum, per funes ligatos et 
cedrina in mercatura tua      [Naves Tarshish, turmae tuae in mercatura tua] unde impleta      es, et honorata facta valde in corde marium, (x)xxvii 1 ad      fin. [3] Ex his et pluribus aliis locis 
in Verbo, apparet quod negotiationes, commercia, mercaturae ac merces, non aliud sint quam quae sunt cognitionum boni et veri; quid enim Verbum propheticum cum negotiationibus Tyri nisi per illas 
spiritualia et caelestia significentur; et quia ita, manifeste constare potest quod non solum per merces alia significentur, sed etiam per gentes {8} ibi (x)nominatas illi apud quos talia; tum quod 
non sciri possit quid significant nisi ex sensu interno, ut quid {9} Tarshish, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, filii Dedanis, Syria, Jehudah, Israel, Dan, Javan, Dedan, Arabs, Sheba, Raamah, Haran, (x)Canneh, 
Eden, Asshur, Kilmad; tum quid {2} merces eorum, ut argentum, ferrum, stannum, plumbum, vasa aeris, tritica, minnith, pannag, mel, oleum, opobalsamum, vinum Helbonis, lana zaharis, netum, vestes 
libertatis ad currum, agni, arietes, hirci, aroma, lapis pretiosis, aurum, glomeres hyacinthini, acupictum, funes ligati, cedrina: haec et similia significant {10} bona et vera quae sunt Ecclesiae 
(c)et regni Domini atque eorum cognitiones; quapropter de Tyro ibi actum est, ex causa quia per `Tyrum' significantur cognitiones, n. 1201 et quia tales `merces,' seu bona et vera, in Ecclesia 
et regno Domini sunt, etiam terra Canaan per quam Ecclesia et regnum Domini significatur, ab antiquissimo tempore ita nominata fuit a mercibus seu mercaturis, Canaan {11} enim in lingua originali, 
id significat.  Ex his nunc patet quid significatur per `negotiando pervagari {12} terram.'      @1 i est$      @2 Minnith is regarded by many as a place name, see Jud. xi 33, and pannag as a form
