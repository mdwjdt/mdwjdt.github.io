<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第823节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>823.</strong>人在肉身生活期间无论做过什么，都会在来生（灵界）逐渐重现，他所思想的一切同样如此。当敌意、仇恨和欺骗返回时，他所怀恨和暗中密谋反对的人会被带到他面前，事实上，这一切就在一瞬间。关于来生（灵界）的这种临在，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。他反对这些人的思维也清晰可见。因为灵界存在对一切思维的直觉。这会导致悲惨的状态，因为隐藏的仇恨会公然爆发出来。对恶人而言，其一切恶行和思维就这样重现。善人的情况则不然，他们所有的状态都是良善、友谊和爱的状态，伴随着无上的快乐和幸福。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]823.</strong> Whatever we have done during bodily life, and even whatever we have thought, gradually comes back in the other life. When the hostile, spiteful, underhanded actions we have taken return, the individuals we hated and secretly plotted against also appear before us, and appear in an instant. That is how things operate in the next life. (Later sections [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6893" target=_top>6893</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_823/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7498" target=_top>7498</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy, will deal with this kind of presence.) The negative thoughts we have had about the people are also plain to see, since everyone's thoughts are perceptible. Miserable states result; hidden hatreds erupt openly.<br />Bad people find that all their misdeeds and thoughts come back with vivid realism in this way, but good people do not. With them, all states of goodness, friendship, and love return, bringing with them the highest pleasure and happiness. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 823</b></p><p><b>823.</b>
Whatever a man has done in the life of the body successively returns in the other life, and so does all that he has even thought. When his enmities, hatreds, and deceits return, the persons against whom 
he has indulged hatred and has clandestinely plotted are made present to him, and this in a moment. Such is the case in the other life; but concerning this presence, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. 
The thoughts a man has harbored against others make their appearance openly, for there is a perception of all thoughts. Hence come lamentable states, for there concealed hatreds break out openly. 
With the evil all their evil deeds and thoughts thus return, to the life; but it is not so with the good. With these all their good states of friendship and love return, attended with the highest 
delight and happiness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 823</b></p><p><b>823.</b>
Whatever a person has done during his lifetime gradually reappears in the next life, and so does whatever he has thought. When enmity, hatred, and deceit reappear, so also do the persons against whom 
he has harboured hatred and plotted in secret. They are brought into his presence, and indeed in an instant. This kind of presence in the next life will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later 
on. The thoughts too which he has harboured against those persons are plainly visible, for a perception of all thoughts exists there. This leads to states that are wretched. Concealed hatred there bursts 
out into the open. With people who are evil all their wicked deeds and their thoughts visibly reappear in this manner. But the same does not happen to those who are good. All their states are states 
of good, friendship, and love, accompanied by supreme delight and happiness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 823</b>
</p><b>823.</b>
Quicquid homo fecit in vita corporis, hoc redit in altera vita successive, immo quicquid cogitavit: cum redeunt inimicitiae, odia, doli, etiam personae contra quos odia habuit et clandestine machinatus 
est, sistuntur praesentes, et quidem momento: ita se res habet in altera vita, de qua praesentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; et cogitationes quas habuit contra illos, patent manifeste, 
nam omnium cogitationum datur perceptio; inde lamentabiles status; odia recondita ibi aperte erumpunt; qui mali sunt, omnia eorum malefacta et cogitata ita redeunt ad vivum; at qui boni sunt, 
non ita; eorum omnes status boni, amicitiae et amoris, cum summa jucunditate et felicitate. </p>
