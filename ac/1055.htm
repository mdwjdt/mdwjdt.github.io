<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1055节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1055.</strong>“要记念永约”表以便主在仁爱中与他同在。这一点从有关圣约含义的阐述和说明清楚可知，即除了爱主爱邻外，再没有其它“永约”了。这圣约是永恒的，因为它从永恒持续到永恒。整个天堂建立在爱的基础上，整个自然界也是如此。因为在自然界中，凡物若没有溯源于爱的联结或结合，就不可能存在，无论有生命的还是无生命的。因为一切属世之物皆产生于属灵之物，属灵之物则产生于属天之物，如前所述。所以，爱或爱的类似物被植入在每一个事物中。唯独人没有爱，而是有反面，因为人摧毁了自己里面的自然秩序。但当他能重生，即能恢复秩序并接受相爱时，这圣约或结合，也就是此处论述的主题，会藉着仁爱而存在。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1055.</strong> The fact that to remember the eternal pact means it is such that the Lord can be present with them in charity can be seen from what was said and shown above concerning the symbolism of a pact. I noted that there is no eternal compact aside from love for the Lord and love for one's neighbor [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665" target=_top>665-666</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1025:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038" target=_top>1038</a>]. This pact is eternal, because it stretches from eternity to eternity. The whole of heaven rests on love as its foundation. In fact the whole of creation does, because nothing animate or inanimate in the physical world that involves any kind of union or affiliation can possibly exist without tracing its origin to love. This is because everything in the physical world springs from something spiritual, and everything spiritual, from something heavenly, as mentioned earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775#subsection-2-2" target=_top>775:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_880#subsection-2-2" target=_top>880:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_911" target=_top>911</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025#subsection-2-7" target=_top>1025:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1055/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9" target=_top>9</a>]. So each and every object has love (or something resembling love) implanted in it. Only humankind lacks love. In us love is replaced by its opposite, since we have destroyed the proper pattern of nature in ourselves. But when we are capable of being reborn, or being restored once more to the proper pattern, and welcoming mutual love, there is a pact. That is to say, charity (the subject here) then creates a bond. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1055</b></p><p><b>1055.</b>
That I may remember the eternal covenant. That this signifies that the Lord can be present with him in charity, is evident from what has been said and shown about the signification of a "covenant" namely, 
that there is no other "eternal covenant" than love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor. This is eternal, because from eternity to eternity. The universal heaven is founded in love, and so 
is universal nature; for in nature nothing whatever is possible-in which there is any union and conjunction, whether it be animate or inanimate-that does not derive its origin from love. For every natural 
thing comes into existence from something spiritual, and the spiritual from the celestial, as said above. Hence love, or a semblance of love, has been implanted in all things in general and in particular; 
with man alone there is not love, but the contrary, because man has destroyed in himself the order of nature. When however he can be regenerated, or restored again to order, and can receive 
mutual love, then there is "the covenant" or conjunction by charity, that is here treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1055</b></p><p><b>1055.</b>
'To remember the eternal covenant' means so that the Lord can be present with him within charity. This is clear from what has been stated and shown above about the meaning of a covenant, namely, that 
there is no other eternal covenant except love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. This covenant is eternal because it lasts from eternity into eternity. The whole of heaven is founded on love, 
as indeed is the whole natural order, for in the natural order nothing whatever exists, possessing any union or conjunction, which does not trace its origin back to love, whether it be animate or inanimate. 
Indeed everything natural arises from what is spiritual, and what is spiritual does so from what is celestial, as stated above. Consequently love, or the semblance of it, is implanted in every 
single thing. Man is the only being with whom love does not reside but the contrary, for man has destroyed within himself the order of nature. But when he is able to be regenerated, that is, to be 
restored again to order and receive mutual love, then the covenant or conjunction by means of charity exists, which is the subject here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1055</b>
</p><b>1055.</b>
'Ad recordandum foederis aeterni': quod significet ut Dominus praesens possit apud eum esse in charitate, constat ex illis quae de significatione foederis supra dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe nullum 
aliud foedus aeternum sit quam amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum; hoc aeternum est quia ab aeterno in aeternum universum caelum fundatum est in amore, immo universa natura, nam in natura nihil 
quicquam datur ubi aliqua unio et conjunctio, quod non originem trahat ab amore, sive animatum sit sive non animatum, omne enim naturale existit a spirituali, et spirituale caelesti, ut supra dictum; 
inde omnibus et singulis amor implantari est, aut instar amoris; solum apud hominem non est amor se contrarium, quia homo ordinem naturae in se destruxit; at cur regenerari potest seu iterum restitui 
ordini, et accipere amorem mutuum, tunc est foedus seu conjunctio per charitatem, de qua tu agitur. </p>
