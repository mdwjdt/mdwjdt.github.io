<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第716节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>716.</strong>“每样七对”表它们是神圣的。这一点从前面有关第七日，或安息日的解读（<a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a>节）清楚可知。也就是说，主是第七日，每一个属天教会，或属天之人都通过祂而成为一个第七日，事实上，就是属天的本身，因为属天的唯独是主的，是最为神圣的。所以，在圣言中，七表示神圣。事实上，如此处，就内义而言，七与数字本身毫无瓜葛。通晓内义的人，如天使与天使灵，根本不知道什么是数字，因此不知道七是什么。所以，这里根本不是在说凡洁净的牲畜，都取了七对，或善的牲畜与恶的牲畜的比率是七比二；而是在说：该教会成员所具备的意愿之物是神圣的良善，他能借以被重生，如前所述。<br />②“七”表神圣的，或神圣之物。这一点从代表性教会的仪式清楚可知，其中数字七屡次出现。如用血和油弹了七次，利未记：<br />摩西用膏油抹帐幕和其中所有的，使它们为圣。又用膏油在坛上弹了七次，又抹了坛和坛的一切器皿，使它们成圣。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.10.htm">8:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这里的“七次”若不象征神圣之物，则毫无意义。“油”表爱的圣洁。当亚伦进入圣所时，利未记上说：<br />他要取些小公牛的血，用指头弹在施恩座的东面，又用指头在施恩座的前面弹血七次。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.14.htm">16:14</a>）<br />坛也一样：<br />他要用指头把血弹在坛上七次，洁净了坛，使它成圣。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.19.htm">16:19</a>）<br />此处每一个细节都表示主自己，因此表示爱的圣洁，也就是说，“血”，“施恩座”，“祭坛”，“东面”，即血所弹的方向，以及“七”全都表示主。<br />③如果有灵魂无意中犯了罪，或是受膏的祭司犯罪，使百姓陷在罪里，他要把小公牛宰于耶和华面前。祭司把指头蘸于血中，在耶和华面前对着圣所的幔子弹血七次。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这里的“七次”同样表示神圣之物，因为所阐述的是赎罪，因此是主，因为赎罪唯独是主的。关于洁净大麻风的教导也一样，对此，利未记上说：<br />祭司要把鸟的血和香柏木、朱红色线并牛膝草，在那长大麻疯求洁净的人身上洒七次，就定他为洁净。同样把左手里的油，在耶和华面前弹七次。同样在有大麻风的房子里，他要取一些香柏木、牛膝草并朱红色线，要弹一些鸟血七次。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.6.htm">14:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.51.htm">51</a>）<br />谁都能看出，香柏木、朱红色线、牛膝草、油、鸟血，因而数字七，若不代表神圣之物，则毫无意义。若拿走它们所代表的神圣之物，就只剩下死物，或不神圣和偶像崇拜之物。然而，当它们表示神圣事物时，在这种情况下，它们所包含的敬拜就是一种神圣敬拜。这种敬拜是内在的，只是被外在事物所代表。不过，犹太人并不知道这些事物所表示的意义，如今谁也不知道香柏木、牛膝草、朱红色线、鸟都表示什么。然而，只要他们愿意认为这些象征了他们所不知道的神圣事物，并因此敬拜主，祂就是那要来的弥赛亚，会医治他们的大麻风，也就是说，使他们免于亵渎神圣之物，他们就能得救。凡这样思考和相信的人若愿意，会在来生（灵界）立刻接受指教，从而知道每一个细节代表了什么。<br />④祭司要用指头蘸纯红母牛的血，向会幕前面弹七次（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.4.htm">19:4</a>），其中提到的“纯红母牛” 是同样的意思。因为“第七日”或安息日表示主，是属天之人或属天的本身所表示之义，所以在犹太教会中，第七日是所有宗教仪式中最为神圣的。为此，每个第七年都要守一个安息年（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.4.htm">25:4</a>）。七个安息年，就是七七年之后要宣告一个禧年（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.8.htm">25:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.9.htm">9</a>）。在至高义上，数字七表示主，由此表示爱的圣洁。这一点从经上提到的金灯台及其七个灯盏（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.31.htm">25:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.33.htm">33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.37.htm">37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.17.htm">37:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.23.htm">23</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.2.htm">8:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.3.htm">3</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番4.2.htm">4:2</a>）也清楚可知。约翰论及灯台时说：<br />七个金灯台，灯台中间有一位好像人子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />显而易见，“金灯台及其七个灯盏”表示主，“灯台”是包含属天之物的爱的神圣事物，这也是为何它们有七盏的原因。<br />⑤<br />从宝座中发出的七盏火灯在宝座前点着，这七灯就是神的七灵。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.5.htm">4:5</a>）<br />从主的宝座中发出的“七盏火灯”就是七盏灯台。先知书中出现的数字七也一样，如以赛亚书：<br />当耶和华缠裹他百姓的损处的日子，月光必像日光，日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>）<br />“日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样”根本不表示七倍，而表示日头所象征的爱的圣洁。也可参看前面关于数字七的阐述和说明（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创4.15.htm">4:15</a>）。综上所述，明显可知，圣言中所采用的所有数字就内义而言，绝不是指数字（如前所述，创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创6.3.htm">6:3</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]716.</strong> The symbolism of seven each as things that are holy can be seen from what was said about the seventh or Sabbath day above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_84" target=_top>84-87</a>. Those sections say that the Lord is the seventh day and that from him comes the entire heavenly church, or the heavenly person, and in fact the heavenly quality itself, which, because it belongs to the Lord alone, is very sacred. In the Word, accordingly, seven symbolizes holiness.{*1} Indeed the inner meaning contains absolutely no suggestion of numbers in places like this, since people absorbed by the inner meaning (angels and angelic spirits, for example) do not even know what a number is and so what seven is. As a result, the present verse makes no implication whatever that they took seven pairs of every clean animal or in other words, that they possessed goodness in a seven-to-two ratio to evil. The meaning is that the qualities of will with which the member of the church was being supplied were good ones, holy ones, which as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_677" target=_top>677</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_679" target=_top>679-680</a>] make regeneration possible.<br />[2] The symbolism of seven as holiness or holy elements can be seen from the rituals of the representative church,{*2} in which the number seven crops up so many times. One example is the sevenfold spattering of some of the blood and oil [used in a ritual], as, for instance, in Leviticus:<br />Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the dwelling place and everything that was in it and consecrated them, and he spattered some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils to consecrate them.{*3} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_8_10-11" target=_top>Leviticus 8:10-11</a>)<br />Seven times would have had no meaning here at all had holiness not been represented by it. The oil symbolizes the holy quality of love. From another place:<br />When Aaron enters the holy place, he shall take some of the young ox's blood and spatter it with his finger on the face of the appeasement cover, toward the east, and he shall spatter some of the blood with his finger before the face of the appeasement cover seven times. Likewise, at the altar, he shall spatter some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and he shall cleanse it and consecrate it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_14" target=_top>Leviticus 16:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_19" target=_top>19</a>)<br />Each and every item here symbolizes the Lord himself and consequently the holiness of love — the blood, the appeasement cover, the altar, the east toward which the blood was to be spattered, and so the number seven as well.<br />[3] It was similar with the sacrifices, discussed in another place:{*4} If a soul sins by mistake, or if an anointed priest sins, to the people's guilt, he shall slaughter a young ox before Jehovah, and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and spatter some of the blood seven times before Jehovah toward the veil of the holy place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_1" target=_top>Leviticus 4:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_6" target=_top>6</a>)<br />Here again seven symbolizes holiness, because the verses are describing atonement, which is exclusively the Lord's function, and as a result they are describing the Lord. Similar rituals were also established for the healing of leprosy as described in another place:<br />Using the blood of a flying creature, cedar wood, scarlet cloth, and hyssop, seven times the priest shall spatter the person to be cleansed of leprosy and cleanse the person. Again, seven times [he shall spatter] some of the oil that is on his left palm before Jehovah. And again, using the cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet cloth and flying creature's blood, seven times he shall spatter a house where there is leprosy. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_14_6-7" target=_top>Leviticus 14:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_14_27" target=_top>27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_14_51" target=_top>51</a>)<br />Anyone can see that there is absolutely nothing meaningful in the cedar wood, scarlet cloth, hyssop, oil, or flying creature's blood, or consequently in the number seven, unless it comes from their function in representing what is holy. If you remove all holy import from them, what remains is a lifeless triviality or something profane and idolatrous. When they symbolize something holy, on the other hand, the worship bound up in them is divine worship, which takes place deep within and is merely represented by the outward acts.<br />Certainly the Jews had no way of knowing what these things symbolized — the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet cloth, the bird — so no one today does either. Still, if they had only cared to, they could have considered that something holy but beyond their ken was involved. So they could have worshiped the Lord, or in other words, the Messiah who was to come and cure them of their leprosy, that is, of profaning what is holy. Then they could have been saved.{*5} As soon as those who think this way and believe these things arrive in the other world, they learn (if they so desire) what every single detail represented.<br />[4] Something similar is said about the red cow:<br />The priest would take some of its blood on his finger and spatter some of its blood toward the face of the meeting tent seven times. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_numbers_19_4" target=_top>Numbers 19:4</a>)<br />As the seventh day or Sabbath symbolized the Lord and (because of him) the heavenly person and heavenliness itself, in the Jewish religion the seventh day was far more sacred than any ritual. That was the reason for the absolute Sabbath every seventh year (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_25_4" target=_top>Leviticus 25:4</a>) and for the jubilee that was to be proclaimed after seven Sabbaths of years, that is, after seven times seven years (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_25_8-9" target=_top>Leviticus 25:8-9</a>).<br />The symbolism of seven at the highest level as the Lord and so as the holiness of love can also be seen from the golden lampstand with its seven lamps, which are described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_31" target=_top>Exodus 25:31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_32" target=_top>32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_33" target=_top>33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_37" target=_top>37</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_37_17" target=_top>37:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_37_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_37_19" target=_top>19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_exodus_37_23" target=_top>23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_numbers_8_2-3" target=_top>Numbers 8:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_4_2" target=_top>Zechariah 4:2</a>. This is what John says about them:<br />... seven golden lampstands; in the middle of the seven lampstands was one like the Son of Humankind. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_revelation_1_12-13" target=_top>Revelation 1:12-13</a>)<br />It is obvious that the lampstand with its seven lamps symbolizes the Lord and that lamps stand for holy love — a heavenly thing — which is why there were seven of them.<br />[5] In the same author:<br />From the throne came seven fiery lanterns burning before the throne, which are God's seven spirits. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_revelation_4_5" target=_top>Revelation 4:5</a>)<br />The seven lanterns that came from the Lord's throne are seven lamps. The number seven has a similar meaning where it comes up in the prophets, as in Isaiah:<br />The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times as strong, like the light of seven days, on the day when Jehovah bandages his people's fracture. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Isaiah 30:26</a>)<br />The light seven times as strong, like the light of seven days, does not mean any sevenfold strength but the holiness of the love that the sun symbolizes. See also the statements made and evidence offered above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_15" target=_top>Genesis 4:15</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>].<br />These things add to the proof that no number in the Word, no matter what it is, ever has a merely numerical meaning. This too was shown above, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>Genesis 6:3</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575" target=_top>575-578</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the symbolism of the number seven in Scripture, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a> and note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} By the term "the rituals of the representative church," Swedenborg means the rituals enjoined on Jews in the Hebrew Scriptures. He indicates what he means by a representative church in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101" target=_top>101</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_349" target=_top>349:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_730#subsection-2-4" target=_top>730:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1437" target=_top>1437</a>. [LHC]<br />{*3} The Latin words here translated "consecrated" and "consecrate" stem from the verb sanctificare, which is related to the Latin word for "holy," sanctus. This is no doubt why, for the purposes of this discussion of holiness, Swedenborg emphasized these words. [LHC]<br />{*4} The first edition incorrectly identifies the Book of Numbers as the source of the quotation that follows at this point, and mentions no book name where the citation is given following the quotation; so the reading "in another place" has been accepted instead, to echo the phrase, "from another place," just above in the section. This is Swedenborg's normal reference for a different passage from the same Bible book that has just been cited. In keeping with this practice of Swedenborg's, the reading "in another place" has been supplied for the reading of the first edition, "in Leviticus" (in Levitico), before the next quotation.

That holy things are signified by "seven" is evident from what has been said before respecting the seventh day, or the sabbath (n. 84-87), namely, that the Lord is the seventh day; and that from Him 
every celestial church, or celestial man, is a seventh day, and indeed the celestial itself, which is most holy because it is from the Lord alone. For this reason, in the Word, "seven" signifies what 
is holy; and in fact, as here, in the internal sense partakes not at all of the idea of number. For they who are in the internal sense, as angels and angelic spirits are, do not even know what number 
is, and therefore not what seven is. Therefore it is not meant here that seven pairs were to be taken of all the clean beasts; or that there was so much of good in proportion to evil as seven to two; 
but that the things of the will with which this man of the church was furnished were goods, which are holy, whereby he could be regenerated, as was said above.  [2] That "seven" signifies what is holy, 
or holy things, is evident from the rituals in the representative church, wherein the number seven so frequently occurs. For example, they were to sprinkle of the blood and the oil seven times, as 
related in Leviticus: </p>
<p>Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them; and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar 
and all its vessels, to sanctify them (Lev. 8:10-11). Here "seven times" would be entirely without significance if what is holy were not thus represented. And in another place: When Aaron came into 
the holy place it is said: He shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle with his finger upon the faces of the mercy seat toward the east; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the 
blood with his finger seven times (Lev. 16:14). And so at the altar: </p>
<p>     He shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and sanctify it (Lev. 16:19). The particulars 
here, each and all, signify the Lord Himself, and therefore the holy of love; that is to say, the "blood" the "mercy seat" and also the "altar" and the "east" toward which the blood was to be 
sprinkled, and therefore also "seven." [3] And likewise in the sacrifices, of which in Leviticus: </p>
<p>     If a soul shall sin through error, and if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on 
the people, he shall slay the bullock before Jehovah, and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, toward the veil of the sanctuary (Lev. 4:2-3, 
6). Here in like manner "seven" signifies what is holy; because the subject treated of is expiation, which is of the Lord alone, and therefore the subject treated of is the Lord. Similar rites were 
also instituted in respect to the cleansing of leprosy, concerning which in Leviticus: </p>
<p>     Of the blood of the bird, with cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop, the priest shall sprinkle upon him 
that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall make him clean. In like manner he was to sprinkle of the oil that was upon the palm of his left hand seven times before Jehovah. And so in 
a house where there was leprosy, he was to take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and with the blood of the bird sprinkle seven times (Lev. 14:6-7, 27, 51).Here anyone may see that there is nothing 
at all in the "cedar wood" the "scarlet" the "oil" the "blood of a bird" nor yet in "seven" except from the fact that they are representative of holy things. Take away from them what is holy, and all 
that remains is dead, or profanely idolatrous. But when they signify holy things there is Divine worship therein, which is internal, and is only represented by the externals. The Jews indeed could not 
know what these things signified; nor does anyone at the present day know what was signified by the "cedar wood" the "hyssop" the "scarlet" and the "bird." But if they had only been willing to think 
that holy things were involved which they did not know, and so had worshiped the Lord, or the Messiah who was to come, who would heal them of their leprosy-that is, of their profanation of holy things-they 
might have been saved. For they who so think and believe are at once instructed in the other life, if they desire, as to what each and all things represented.  [4] And in like manner it was commanded 
respecting the red heifer: </p>
<p>     The priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood toward the face of the tent of meeting seven times (Num. 19:4). As the "seventh day" 
or "sabbath" signified the Lord, and from Him the celestial man, and the celestial itself, the seventh day in the Jewish Church was of all religious observances the most holy; and hence came the "sabbath 
of sabbath" in the seventh year (Lev. 25:4), and the "jubilee" that was proclaimed after the seven sabbaths of years, or after seven times seven years (25:8-9). That in the highest sense "seven" 
signifies the Lord, and hence the holy of love, is evident also from the golden candlestick and its seven lamps (concerning which in Exod. 25:31-33, 37; 37:17-19, 23; Num. 8:2, 3; Zech. 4:2) and of 
which it is thus written by John: </p>
<p>     Seven golden lampstands; and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like unto the Son of man (Rev. 1:12-13). It very clearly appears in this passage that the 
"lampstand with the seven lamps" signifies the Lord, and that the "lamps" are the holy things of love, or celestial things; and therefore they were "seven."       [5] And again: </p>
<p>     Out of the throne 
went forth seven torches of fire, burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God (Rev. 4:5). Here the "seven torches" that went forth out of the throne of the Lord are the seven lights, 
or lamps. The same is signified wherever the number "seven" occurs in the Prophets, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, 
as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the breach of His people (Isa. 30:26). Here the "sevenfold light, as the light of seven days" does not signify sevenfold, but the 
holy of the love signified by the "sun." See also what was said and shown above respecting the number "seven" (chapter 4, verse 15). From all this again it is clearly evident that whatever numbers are 
used in the Word never mean numbers (as was also shown before, chapter 6:3). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 716</b></p><p><b>716.</b>
'Sevens of each' means that they are holy. This is clear from what has been stated already in <a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a> about the seventh day or sabbath. That is to say, the Lord is the Seventh Day and from Him derives 
every celestial Church or man, and indeed, the celestial itself which, because it is the Lord's alone, is most holy. Consequently seven in the Word means holy; indeed in the internal sense, as here, absolutely 
nothing is obtained from the number itself. For people who possess the internal sense, as angels and angelic spirits do, have no concept at all of what a number is, and so do not know what seven 
is. Therefore the idea that they were to take seven pairs of all the clean beasts, or that the ratio of the good to the evil was to be seven to two, is not at all the meaning here. Rather it is this: 
Things of the will with which this member of the Church was supplied were the goods which are holy, through which, as stated already, he was capable of being regenerated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'seven' means 
that which is holy, or things that are holy, becomes clear from the rituals in the representative Church, where the number seven occurs time and again, for example, being sprinkled seven times with 
blood and oil, as in Leviticus, </p>
<blockquote>
Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything that was in it and made them holy. And he sprinkled some of it over the altar seven times, and 
anointed the altar and all its vessels to make them holy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%208:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 8:10, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'seven times' would be utterly devoid of meaning if that which is holy was not being represented in this way. 'Oil' 
there means the holiness of love. And elsewhere in Leviticus, when Aaron entered the Holy Place, </p>
<p>He shall take some of the blood of the young bull, and shall sprinkle it with his finger over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
of the mercy-seat towards the east, and he shall sprinkle the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the mercy-seat seven times with some of the blood with his finger. </p>
<p>Similarly with the altar, </p>
<blockquote>
He shall sprinkle over it 
some of the blood with his finger seven times, and shall cleanse it, and make it holy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:14,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16:14, 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here every single detail means the Lord Himself, and therefore the holiness of love - that is 
to say, 'the blood' and also 'the mercy-seat', 'the altar' too, 'the east in which direction the blood was to be sprinkled', and so 'seven' as well, all mean the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In sacrifices it is similar, 
about which the following is said in Leviticus,  </p>
<blockquote>
If a soul has sinned inadvertently, and if the anointed priest has sinned, thus making the people guilty, he shall slaughter the young bull in 
Jehovah's presence. And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of the blood seven times in Jehovah's presence towards the veil of the Holy Place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%204:2-4,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 4:2-4, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 
'seven' means that which is holy, for the subject is atonement, and therefore the Lord, since atonement is the Lord's alone. Similar instructions were also given concerning the cleansing of leprosy, 
about which the following is said in Leviticus,  </p>
<blockquote>
[Taking some] of the bird's blood, the cedar-wood, the double-dyed scarlet, and the hyssop, the priest shall sprinkle over the one who is to be cleansed 
from leprosy seven times, and shall cleanse him. In a similar way some of the oil which is in his left palm, seven times in Jehovah's presence. In a similar way in a house where there is leprosy, 
[he shall take some] of the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the double-dyed scarlet, and shall sprinkle some of the bird's blood seven times. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2014:6,%207,%2027,%2051&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 14:6, 7, 27, 51</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that here cedar-wood, 
double-dyed scarlet, hyssop, oil, and blood of a bird, and so the number seven, would be utterly meaningless if things that are holy were not being represented by them. If you take away from them 
holy things, what is left is something dead, or something unholy and idolatrous. When however they do mean holy things the worship they contain in that case is a Divine worship which is internal and 
simply represented by things that are external. The Jews however were incapable of knowing what these meant; and neither does anyone today know what cedar-wood, hyssop, double-dyed scarlet, and the 
bird all mean. Yet if only they had been willing to think that these did embody holy things which they did not actually know, and so had worshipped the Lord - who was the Messiah to come who would heal 
them from their leprosy, that is, from profaning what is holy - they could have been saved. For people who do think and believe in this manner straightaway receive instruction in the next life, if 
they desire it, as to what every single detail represented. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Similarly where 'the red heifer' is the subject it is said that the priest was to take some of its blood on his finger, and sprinkle 
some of its blood towards the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the tent of meeting seven times, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2019:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 19:4</a>. Because 'the seventh day' or sabbath meant the Lord, and from Him meant the celestial man and the celestial itself, the 
seventh day in the Jewish Church was the holiest of all its religious observances. For this reason there was a sabbath year<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> every seventh year, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2025:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 25:4</a>. Also a jubilee was to be proclaimed after 
seven sabbaths of years, that is, after seven times seven years, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2025:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 25:8, 9</a>. In the highest sense the number seven means the Lord, and from this the holiness of love. This becomes clear also from 
the golden lampstand with its seven lamps, mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2025:31-33,%2037;%2037:17-19,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 25:31-33, 37; 37:17-19, 23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%208:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 8:2, 3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%204:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 4:2</a>. And in John it is spoken of as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Seven golden lampstands; in the midst of the 
seven lampstands one like the Son of Man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is absolutely clear that 'a lampstand with seven lamps' means the Lord, and that 'the lamps' are the holy things of love, which comprise 
celestial things, which also is why there were seven of them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
From the throne there were coming forth seven fiery torches burning before the throne, which are the 
seven spirits of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the seven torches which came forth from the Lord's throne' are seven lamps. The same applies to the number seven when it occurs in the Prophets, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, on the day when Jehovah will bind up the hurt of His people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'sevenfold light as the light of seven days' does not at all mean sevenfold but the holiness of love meant by the sun. See also what has been stated and shown already at Chapter 4:15 concerning 
the number seven. From these quotations it is also quite clear that all numbers used in the Word never have a numerical value [in the internal sense], as has also been shown already at 6:3.

Quod per 'septena' significentur sancta, constat ab illis quae prius de septimo die seu sabbato dictum, n. 84-87, quod nempe Dominus sit Septimus Dies, et ex Ipso omnis caelestis Ecclesia, seu homo, 
immo ipsum caeleste quod quia est solius Domini, est sanctissimum; inde 'septem' in Verbo significant sanctum, et quidem in sensu interno prorsus nihil quod ex numero, ut hic; nam qui in sensu interno 
sunt, ut angeli et spiritus angelici, ne quidem sciunt quid numerus, proinde quid septem; ideo nusquam hic significatur quod acciperentur de omni bestia munda septem paria, seu quod tantum boni respective 
ad malum, ut septem ad bina, haberet; sed quod voluntaria, quibus instructus hic homo Ecclesiae fuit, essent bona quae sancta, per quae, ut prius dictum, potuisset regenerari.  [2] Quod 'septem' 
significent sanctum seu sancta, constare potest a ritualibus in Ecclesia repraesentativa, ubi septenarium toties occurrit, sicut 'quod de sanguine et oleo spargeretur septem vicibus'; ut in Levitico, 	Sumpsit 
Moses oleum unctionis unxitque' habitaculum et omnia quae in illo, sanctificavitque illa, et sparsit de illo super altare septem vicibus, et unxit altare et omnia 	vasa ejus  ad sanctificandum 
illa, viii 10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi 'septem vices' nihil prorsus significavissent nisi ita repraesentaretur sanctum; 'oleum' ibi significat sanctum amoris: et alibi, 	Cum intraret Aharon in Sanctum,... accipiet 
de sanguine juvenci, et sparget digito suo super facies propitiatorii orientem versus, et ad facies propitiatorii sparget septem 	vicibus de sanguine digito suo: </p>
<p>similiter ad altare, 	Sparget super 
illud de sanguine digito suo septem vicibus, et mundabit illud, et sanctificabit illud, Lev. xvi 	14, 19; </p>
<p>ubi omnia et singula significant Ipsum Dominum, proinde sanctum amoris, tam scilicet 'sanguis' 
quam 'propitiatorium,' ut et 'altare,' tum 'oriens, versus quem spargeretur sanguis,' proinde etiam 'septem:'  [3] in sacrificiis similiter, de quibus in Levitico{1}, 	Si anima peccaverit per 
errorem,... et si sacerdos unctus peccaverit ad reatum populi,... mactabit juvencum coram Jehovah,... et intinget sacerdos digitum suum in sanguine, et sparget de sanguine septem vicibus coram Jehovah 
versus velum Sancti, iv (x)2, 3, 4, 6; </p>
<p>ubi similiter 'septem' significant sanctum, quia de expiatione, quae solius est Domini, ita de Domino, agitur. Similia quoque instituta sunt circa mundationem 
leprae, de qua in Levitico, 	Ex volucris sanguine, ligno cedri, et coccineo, et hyssopo, sparget sacerdos super mundandum a lepra septem vicibus, et mundabit eum;... similiter de oleo, quod super vola 
ejus sinistra, septem vicibus coram Jehovah.... 	Similiter in domum ubi lepra, ex ligno cedri, et hyssopo, et coccineo, et sanguine volucris sparget septem vicibus, xiv 6, 7, 27, 51; </p>
<p>ubi quisque videre 
potest quod nihil prorsus sit in ligno cedri, coccineo, hyssopo, oleo, sanguine volucris, ita nec in septem, nisi inde quod per illa repraesentarentur sancta; si sancta inde abstrahis, manet mortuum 
quid, aut profanum idololatricum; sed cum significantur sancta, tunc cultus inibi est Divinus, qui est internus, et modo repraesentatur per externa: non quidem potuerunt scire Judaei quid significarent, 
sic nec quisquam hodie, quid lignum cedri, quid hyssopus, quid coccineum, quid avis, usque si modo voluissent cogitare quod sancta involverent quae nescirent, et sic coluissent Dominum, seu Messiam 
venturum, Qui sanaret eos ab eorum 'lepra,' hoc est, a profanatione sancti, salvari potuissent; nam qui ita cogitant et credunt, in altera vita instruuntur ilico, si desiderant, quid omnia et singula repraesentaverint. 
 [4] Similiter de 'vacca rufa,' 	Quod acciperet sacerdos de sanguine digito suo, et spargeret versus facies tentorii conventus de sanguine ejus septem vicibus, Num. xix 4. Quia 
'septimus dies' seu 'sabbatum' significabat Dominum, et ab Ipso caelestem hominem, et ipsum caeleste, septimus dies in Ecclesia Judaica prae omnibus ritibus sanctissimus erat; inde 'sabbatum sabbati 
anno septimo,' Lev. xxv 4; tum 'jubilaeum, quod proclamaretur post septem sabbata annorum, seu post septem annos septem vicibus,' Lev. xxv 8, 9.  Quod 'septenum' in supremo sensu significet Dominum, 
et inde sanctum amoris, constare potest etiam a candelabro aureo, et septem ejus lucernis, de quibus, Exod. xxv 31-33, 37; xxxvii 17-19, 23; Num. viii 2, 3; Zach. iv 2; de quibus ita apud Johannem, 	Septem 
candelabra aurea; in medio septem candelabrorum similis Filio hominis, Apoc. 1, 12, 13; </p>
<p>ubi clarissime constat quod 'candelabrum cum septem lucernis' significet Dominum, et quod 'lucernae' sint 
sancta amoris seu caelestia, quare etiam septem fuerunt; [5] et apud eundem, 	E throno exibant... septem lampades ignis ardentes coram throno, quae sunt septem spiritus Dei, Apoc. iv 5; </p>
<p>hic 'septem 
lampades quae exiverunt e throno Domini,' sunt septem lucernae. Similiter se habet ubi septenarius numerus occurrit apud Prophetas, ut apud Esaiam, 	Erit lux lunae sicut lux solis, et lux solis erit 
septupla, sicut lux septem dierum, in die quo obligabit Jehovah fracturam populi Sui, xxx 26; </p>
<p>ubi 'lux septupla, sicut lux septem dierum' nusquam significat septuplum, sed sanctum amoris significati 
per 'solem.'  Videatur etiam, quod de septenario numero prius dictum et ostensum, cap. iv vers. 15.  Ex his quoque manifeste constat quod 'numeri' in Verbo, quicumque sunt, nusquam significent numeros, 
ut prius quoque, cap. vi ad vers. 3, ostensum. 	@1 Numeris I.$ </p>
