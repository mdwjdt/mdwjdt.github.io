<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8468节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8468.</strong>“一头一俄梅珥”表足够每个人的量。这从“一俄梅珥”和“一头”的含义清楚可知：“一俄梅珥”是指足够的量，如下文所述；“一头”是指给每个人。“一俄梅珥”之所以表示足够的量，是因为它是一伊法的十分之一，这从本章最后一节经文明显看出来；而“十”表示完全或完整之物（参看<a href="3107.htm">3107</a>节）；因此，“十分之一”表示足够的量，在此表示足够给每个人，也就是给一头的。经上只在本章提到“俄梅珥”，在其它地方用的是“贺梅珥”这个词，贺梅珥是一个含十伊法的量，因而表示完全或完整之物，如在何西阿书：<br />我便用银子十五舍客勒，大麦一贺梅珥半，买一个妇人，一个淫妇。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“一个妇人，一个淫妇”表示以色列的家，在灵义上表示那里的教会；“银子十五舍客勒”和“大麦一贺梅珥”表示全价买她：“银子十五舍客勒”论及真理，“大麦一贺梅珥”论及良善。<br />以西结书：<br />你们要用公道天平、公道伊法、公道罢特。伊法与罢特要一个量度。一罢特可盛一贺梅珥的十分之一，一伊法也可盛一贺梅珥的十分之一，你要按贺梅珥来量。你们当献的供物乃是这样：一贺梅珥小麦要献伊法六分之一；一贺梅珥大麦要献伊法六分之一。所分定的油，按油的罢特，一柯珥油要献一罢特的十分之一，一贺梅珥十罢特，因为十罢特就是一贺梅珥。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.10.htm">45:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这论及一个新地和新殿，以此表示主的属灵国度。谁都能看出，那里没有一贺梅珥、一伊法、一罢特、一柯珥，也不会有小麦、大麦或油。由此明显可知，这些事物表示属于属灵国度的那类事物；显然，这类事物是属灵事物，因而是要么与仁之良善有关，要么与信之真理有关的事物。“贺梅珥”论及良善，因为它是量小麦和大麦的一个单位；“伊法”也是。但“罢特”论及真理，因为它是量酒的一个单位。然而，它也是量油的一个单位，故表示爱之良善，经上说，一罢特要与一伊法同是一贺梅珥的一部分，这在灵义上表示属灵国度的一切事物都要与良善有关，而且那里的真理也将是良善。这良善也要足分量地被赐予，因为“一贺梅珥”表示完全或完整之物。<br />以赛亚书：<br />必有许多又大又美的房屋成为荒凉，无人居住。十亩葡萄园只出一罢特，一贺梅珥谷种只结一伊法。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.9.htm">5:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处“十亩”表示完全或完整之物，也表示大量，“一贺梅珥”也是；但“一罢特”和“一伊法”表示少量；因为当“十”表示大量时，“十分之一”就表示少量。摩西五经：<br />人若将他所承受的田产分别为圣，归给耶和华，你要按他的撒种多少估定价值，若撒大麦一贺梅珥，要估价五十舍客勒银子。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利27.16.htm">27:16</a>）<br />此处“撒一贺梅珥”，以及“五十舍客勒”表示完全或完整的估价。由于“一贺梅珥”表示完全或完整之物，所以“十贺梅珥”表示过量和多余之物（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民11.32.htm">11:32</a>）。</p>

An omer a head. That this signifies enough for everyone, is evident from the signification of "an omer," as being sufficient (of which presently); and from the signification of "for a head," as being 
for each one. That "an omer" denotes sufficient, is because it was the tenth part of an ephah, as is plain from the last verse of this chapter, and "ten" signifies what is full (see n. 3107); consequently 
"a tenth part" signifies what is sufficient, here for each one, that is, for a head. The "omer" is mentioned only in this chapter; but in other places, the "homer," which was a measure containing 
ten ephahs, and consequently signified what is full; as in Hosea: </p>
<p>     I purchased a woman, an adulteress, for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley (3:1, 2); </p>
<p>where 
by "a woman an adulteress" is meant the house of Israel, in the spiritual sense the church there, the buying of which at a full price is signified by "fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley;" 
"fifteen pieces of silver" are predicated of truth, and "a homer of barley," of good.  [2] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Ye shall have balances of justice, and an ephah of justice, and a bath of justice: 
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, to lift the tenth of a homer to a bath, and to the tenth of a homer the ephah; according to the homer shall be thy measure: this is the heave-offering that 
ye shall heave, the  of an ephah from a homer of wheat, from a homer of barley: and the set portion of oil, the bath for oil, shall be the tenth of a bath out of the cor, ten baths a homer, for ten 
baths are a homer (45:10, 11, 13, 14); </p>
<p>the new earth and the new temple are here treated of, by which is signified the Lord's spiritual kingdom. Everyone can see that there will not be a homer there, 
nor an ephah, nor a bath, nor a cor, neither will there be wheat, barley, or oil. Thus it is evident that by these things are signified such things as are in that kingdom, which plainly are spiritual 
things, thus things which have relation either to the good of charity or to the truth of faith. A "homer" is predicated of good, because it is the measure of wheat and of barley; in like manner an 
"ephah." But a "bath" is predicated of truth, because it is a measure of wine; and as it is also a measure of oil, by which is signified the good of love, it is said that a bath shall be the same part 
of a homer as is an ephah, which denotes in the spiritual sense that all things in that kingdom shall have relation to good, and also that the truth there will be good, and that this shall be given in 
fullness, because by "a homer" is signified what is full.  [3] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Many houses shall be in devastation, even great and beautiful, that there be no inhabitant, for ten acres of vineyard 
shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah (5:9, 10); </p>
<p>here "ten acres" denotes what is full, and also much, in like manner "a homer," but "a bath" and "an ephah" denote few; for 
when "ten" denotes much, "a tenth part" denotes a few. In Moses: </p>
<p>     If a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to his sowing, the sowing 
of a homer of barley for fifty shekels of silver (Lev. 27:16); </p>
<p>where "the sowing of a homer," and also "fifty shekels," denote fullness of estimation. As "a homer" signifies what is full, "ten homers" 
signify what is too much and superfluous (Num. 11:32). </p>

'An omer a head' means the amount for each individual. This is clear from the meaning of 'an omer' as the sufficient amount, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'a head' as for each person. The 
reason why 'an omer' means the sufficient amount is that it was the tenth part of an ephah, as is evident from the final verse of the present chapter; and 'ten' means what is complete, <a href="3107.htm">3107</a>, so that 
'a tenth part' means the sufficient amount, at this point for each individual, meant by 'a head'. 'An omer' is mentioned in the present chapter alone; the term used elsewhere is 'a homer', which was a 
measure that held ten ephahs, and therefore meant what was complete, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I acquired an adulterous woman for fifteen [shekels] of silver, and a homer of barley and half a homer of barley. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%203:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 3:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'an adulterous woman' is used to mean the house of Israel, in the spiritual sense the Church there. Her being acquired for the full price is meant by 'fifteen [shekels] of silver' and 
'a homer of barley' - 'fifteen [shekels] of silver' having reference to truth and 'a homer of barley' to good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath 
The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, so that a tenth of a homer is offered for a hash, and a tenth of a homer for an ephah; your measure shall be after the homer. This is the offering which 
you shall offer: A sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, ... from the barley And the fixed portion of oil, the bath for oil, shall be a tenth of a bath from a cor, which is ten baths to the homer; 
for ten baths area homer. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:10,%2011,%2013,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:10, 11, 13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to a new earth OF land and new temple, meaning the Lord's spiritual kingdom Anyone may see that there will be no homer, ephah, bath, 
or cor there, and no wheat, barley, or oil either. From this it is clear that these objects mean the kinds of things that belong to that spiritual kingdom, which things, it is evident, are spiritual realities, 
that is, they are connected with either the good of charity or the truth of faith. 'Homer' has reference to good because it is a measure of wheat or barley, and so does 'ephah'; but 'bath' has 
reference to truth because it is a measure of wine. Yet being also a measure of oil, by which the good of love is meant, it says that a bath shall be the same part of a homer as an ephah is, which 
means in the spiritual sense that everything there will have a connection with good, and also that truth there will be good. It will also exist in full measure, for 'a homer' means what is complete. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Many houses will be a ruination, large and beautiful ones, so that there is no inhabitant; for ten acres of vineyard will yield but one bath, and the sowing of a homer will yield an 
ephah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'ten acres' stands for complete and also for much, and so does 'a homer'; but 'a bath' and 'an ephah' stand for little. For when 'ten' means much, 'a tenth part' means little. 
In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If a man sanctifies to Jehovah part of a field of his possession, your valuation shall be according to its sowing; the sowing of a homer of barley [shall be valued] at fifty shekels 
of silver. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2027:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 27:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the sowing of a homer' and also 'fifty shekels' stand for the full or complete valuation. Since 'a homer' means what is complete, ten homers means at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2011:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 11:32</a> what 
is in excess and superfluous. </p>

`Omerem ad caput': quod significet quantum cuivis, constat ex significatione `omeris' quod sit quantum satis, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `ad caput' quod sit {1}pro quovis.  {2}Quod `omer' 
sit quantum satis, est quia erat decima pars ephae, ut patet a versu ultimo hujus capitis, ac `decem' significant plenum, n. 3107, inde `decima pars' significat quantum satis, hic cuique, quod est `ad 
caput'; omer nominatur solum in hoc capite, alibi homer, qui erat mensura continens decem ephas, ac inde significabat plenum, ut apud Hoscheam, Comparavi mulierem adulteram per quindecim argenti, et 
homerem hordeorum, et semihomerem hordeorum, iii 2; </p>
<p>ibi per `mulierem adulteram' intelligitur domus Israelis, in sensu spirituali Ecclesia {3}ibi, quae quod comparata sit pleno pretio significatur 
per `quindecim argenti' et per `homerem hordeorum'; `quindecim argenti' praedicantur de vero, et `homer hordeorum' de bono: apud Ezechielem, 2 Lances justitiae, et ephah justitiae, et bath justitiae 
erit vobis; ephae et bathi mensura una erit, ad tollendas decimas homeris batho, et (x)decimam homeris ephah; juxta homerem erit mensura tua: haec sublatio quam tolletis, sexta ephae de homere tritici, 
de hordeis; et statutum olei bathus pro oleo, decima bathi de (x)coro, decem bathi homer, nam decem bathi homer, (x)xlv 10, 11, 13, 14; </p>
<p>ibi agitur de nova terra et de novo templo, per quae significatur 
regnum spirituale Domini; quisque videre potest quod ibi non erunt homer, nec ephah, nec bathus, nec corus, et quoque non (x)triticum, hordeum, oleum; {4}inde constat quod per illa significentur 
talia quae in dicto regno, quae quod sint spiritualia, patet, ita quae {5} vel ad bonum quod charitatis vel ad verum quod fidei {6}referuntur; homer praedicatur de bono, quia est mensura tritici et hordei, 
similiter ephah, at bathus {7} praedicatur de vero, quia {8}est mensura vini, {9}et quia etiam {8}est mensura olei, per quod significatur bonum amoris; dicitur quod bathus erit homeris sicut ephah, 
{10}quod est in sensu spirituali, quod omnia ibi {11}referentur ad bonum {12}, et quoque quod verum ibi erit bonum; et quod hoc dabitur plene, nam per homerem significatur plenum {13}: apud Esaiam, 
3 Domus multae in devastationem erunt, magnae et pulchrae, ut non sit habitator, nam decem jugera vineae facient bathum unum, et sementis homeris {14}faciet epham, v 9, 10; </p>
<p>hic `decem jugera' pro 
pleno et quoque pro multo, similiter `homer,' at `bathus' (c)et `ephah' pro pauco, nam {15}cum decem sunt multum, {16} decima pars est paucum: apud Moschen, Quod si de agro possessionis suae sanctificaverit 
vir Jehovae aestimatio tua juxta sementim ejus, sementis homeris hordei pro quinquaginta siclis argenti, Lev. xxvii 16; </p>
<p>ibi {17} `sementis homeris' et quoque `quinquaginta sicli' pro pleno aestimationis: 
quia `homer' significat plenum, decem homeres significant nimium et superfluum, Num. xi 32. 	@1 ad quemvis$ 	@2 This is an amended version of a faintly deleted passage in A; see Appendix
