<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10127节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10127</strong>.“要在坛上作挽回祭七天”表进入天堂和教会的流注的完整性。这从“七天”、“作挽回祭”和“坛”的含义清楚可知：“七天”是指完整或完全之物，如下文所述；“作挽回祭”是指从邪恶和衍生的虚假中洁净，也如下文所述；“坛”是神性良善方面的主之神性人身的代表（<a href="9388.htm">9388</a>，<a href="9389.htm">9389</a>，<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>，<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节），在此是指在天堂和教会中的（<a href="10123.htm">10123</a>节）。作挽回祭并使坛分别为圣的小公牛的祭祀之所以要献上七天，是因为“七天”和“一周或一七”一样，表示从开始到结束的一个完整时期，无论长短。因此，“七天”也表示完整或完全之物。数字“三”同样表示从开始到结束的一个完整时期，因而也表示完整或完全之物。区别在于，“七”用于论述某种神圣事物的时候，而“三”用于论述任何事物的时候。<br />要知道，圣言中的所有数字都表示真实的属灵事物，这在来世是众所周知的；在那里有时满了数字的纸张从天堂降至下面的灵人。那些接受来自主的流注的灵人就在它们上面看见这些数字所表示的一连串真实事物，就好像是用文字写成的。有好几次我也被允许看见这种纸，还被告知，内层与天使相交的一些上古之人将他们教会的重要事物和天堂的奥秘包进并储存在数字中，为自己作一个纪念。由此可见，圣言中的所有数字都用来表示真实的属灵事物。事实上，在圣言中，没有一个音节是没有意义的，因为圣言不仅写给世上的人，同时也写给天上的天使。因此，圣言是由贯穿众天堂的神性构成的。<br />圣言中的一切数字都表示真实的属灵事物（参看<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="1963.htm">1963</a>，<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>，<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>，<a href="3252.htm">3252</a>，<a href="4364.htm">4364</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="4670.htm">4670</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="6175.htm">6175</a>，<a href="9659.htm">9659</a>节）；在圣言中，“七”意味着神圣之物（参看<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="5268.htm">5268</a>节）；“七”还表示从开始到结束的一个完整时期，因而表示一个完整状态（<a href="6508.htm">6508</a>，<a href="9228.htm">9228</a>节）；“一周或一七”具有同样的含义（<a href="2044.htm">2044</a>，<a href="3845.htm">3845</a>节）；数字“三”具有同样的含义（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="4901.htm">4901</a>，<a href="5123.htm">5123</a>，<a href="5159.htm">5159</a>，<a href="7715.htm">7715</a>，<a href="9198.htm">9198</a>，<a href="9488.htm">9488</a>，<a href="9489.htm">9489</a>，<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节）。<br />至于“挽回祭”，它表示从邪恶和衍生的虚假中洁净，或也可说，它们的移走。由于“挽回祭”和“赎罪祭”具有这种含义，所以它们也意味着良善和真理的植入，以及这二者被主结合。之所以还意味着这种植入，是因为一个人从邪恶和虚假中洁净到何等程度，良善和真理就被主植入并结合到何等程度。因此，当假定这一个时，也就假定了那一个。事实上，主以爱之良善与每个人同在，因为祂爱所有人，并出于爱愿意将他们与自己相结合，这种结合通过爱之良善和信之真理实现。但一个人通过一种邪恶的生活而归给自己的邪恶及其虚假却挡了道，阻碍了来自祂的流注。由此明显可知挽回祭和赎罪祭是什么意思（也可参看<a href="9506.htm">9506</a>节）。</p>

Seven days thou shalt make propitiation upon the altar. That this signifies full in respect to influx into heaven and into the church, is evident from the signification of "seven days," as being what 
is full (of which in what follows); from the signification of "making propitiation," as being purification from evils and the derivative falsities (of which also below); and from the signification of 
"the altar," as being a representative of the Divine Human of the Lord in respect to Divine good (n. 9388, 9389, 9714, 9964), here in heaven and in the church (n. 10123). The sacrifice of the bullock 
for propitiating and sanctifying the altar was to be offered seven days, because "seven days" signified an entire period from beginning to end, greater or less, the same as a "week;" hence also "seven 
days" signify what is full. The number "three" likewise signifies an entire period from beginning to end, and hence also what is full; but with this difference, that "seven" is said when some holy thing 
is treated of, but "three" when anything whatever is treated of. [2] Be it known that all the numbers in the Word signify real things, which is very well known in the other life, where at times 
papers full of numbers are let down from heaven to the spirits beneath, and such spirits as receive influx from the Lord know from the numbers the things signified, in a continuous series, as if it had 
been written with letters. It has also been given to me sometimes to see such papers, and it was also said that some of the most ancient people, who as to their interiors were in company with the angels, 
infolded and stored up in numbers as a memorial for themselves, things of their church and heavenly arcana. From this it can be seen that all the numbers in the Word are significative of real things, 
for there is not the smallest expression in the Word which is not significative, because it was written not only for men, but also at the same time for angels in heaven. From this the Word is Divine 
as it passes through all the heavens.  [3] (That all numbers in the Word signify real things, see n. 575, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, 4364, 4495, 4670, 5265, 6175, 9659; that "seven" in the Word 
involves what is holy, n. 395, 433, 716, 881, 5265, 5268; and an entire period from beginning to end, thus a full state, n. 6508, 9228; and that a "week" has a similar meaning, n. 2044, 3845; and also 
the number "three," n. 2788, 4495, 4901, 5123, 5159, 7715, 9198, 9488, 9489, 9825.) [4] As regards "propitiating," this signifies purification from evils and the derivative falsities, or what is 
the same, their removal; and as "propitiating" and "expiating" have this signification, they also involve the implantation of good and truth, and the conjunction of both by the Lord. That these are involved 
is because insofar as a man is purified from evils and falsities, so far good and truth are implanted and conjoined by the Lord. Wherefore the one being assumed, the other also is assumed, for 
the Lord is present with every man with the good of love, because He loves all, and from love wills to conjoin them with Himself, which is effected through the good of love and the truth of faith; but 
the evils and their falsities which a man appropriates to himself by a life of evil, stand in the way, and hinder the influx. From this it is evident what is meant by propitiation and expiation. (See 
also n. 9506.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10127</b></p><p><b>10127.</b>
'Seven days you shall make propitiation on the altar' means the completeness of the influx into heaven and into the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'seven days' as what is complete, dealt with 
below; from the meaning of 'making propitiation' as purification from evils and consequently falsities, also dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the altar' as that which is representative of 
the Lord's Divine Human in respect of Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="9388.htm">9388</a>, <a href="9389.htm">9389</a>, <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>, <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>, at this point in heaven and in the Church, <a href="10123.htm">10123</a>. The reason why the sacrifice of a young bull to make propitiation 
and sanctify the altar should be carried out for seven days was that 'seven days', the same as 'a week', means a whole period, long or short, from start to finish. Therefore also 'seven days' means 
what is complete. The number three likewise means a whole period from start to finish, and therefore also what is complete. But the difference is that the word 'seven' is used where something holy 
is referred to, but 'three' when anything whatever is the subject.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be remembered that spiritual realities are meant by all numbers in the Word, as is very well known in the next life, 
where sometimes sheets of paper full of numbers are sent down from heaven to spirits below. Those spirits who receive influx from the Lord see in them a whole chain of realities meant by the numbers, 
just as if letters had been used. I too have been allowed on several occasions to see such sheets of paper; and also I have been told about certain of the most ancient people, who inwardly lived in 
fellowship with angels, that they used numbers to embody matters of importance to their Church, and heavenly arcana, and stored those numbers away for themselves as a way of remembering. From this it 
becomes clear that all numbers in the Word serve to mean spiritual realities. For in the Word not a syllable is devoid of meaning, since the Word has been written not only for people in the world but 
also at the same time for angels in heaven. Consequently the Word consists of the Divine passing through all the heavens.  </p>

 As regards 'making propitiation', 
it means purification from evils and consequently falsities, or what amounts to the same thing, the removal of them. And since 'making propitiation and expiation' has this meaning it also implies 
the implantation of goodness and truth and the joining together of the two by the Lord. The reason why this implantation is also implied is that to the extent that a person is purified from evils 
and falsities, goodness and truth are implanted and joined together by the Lord. When therefore the one has been postulated, the other is postulated. For the Lord is present with every person with the 
good of love; He loves all people and in His love wishes to join them to Himself, which is achieved through the good of love and the truth of faith. But the evils and consequent falsities which a person 
makes his own by a life of evil stand in the way and block influx from Him. From all this it is evident what propitiation and expiation is; see also <a href="9506.htm">9506</a>.  </p>

`Septem diebus propitiabis super altari': quod significet plenum quoad influxum in caelum et in Ecclesiam, constat ex significatione `septem dierum' quod sint plenum, de qua sequitur, ex significatione 
`propitiare' quod sit purificatio a malis et inde falsis, de qua etiam sequitur, et ex significatione `altaris' quod sit repraesentativum Divini Humani Domini quoad Divinum Bonum, de qua n. 9388, 
9389, 9714, (x)9964, hic in caelo et (o)in Ecclesia, n. 10,123.  Quod sacrificium ex juvenco ad propitiandum et sanctificandum altare fieret septem dies, erat {7} quia `septem dies' significabant {8} 
integram periodum a principio ad finem, majorem vel minorem, aeque ac septimana; inde etiam `septem dies' significant plenum; numerus `etiam ternarius' significat integram periodum a principio ad finem, 
et inde quoque plenum, sed cum ea differentia quod septem dicantur ubi agitur de re sancta, tria autem cum de re quacumque; [2] sciendum est quod omnes numeri in Verbo significent res, quod perquam 
notum est in altera vita, ubi {9} quandoque chartae e caelo ad spiritus qui infra sunt demittuntur plenae numeris, (c)et illi ex spiritibus qui a Domino recipiunt influxum, sciunt inde res (o)quae significantur 
in continua serie, sicut scriptum foret litteris; tales chartas etiam aliquoties mihi videre datum est; et dictum quoque quod quidam ex antiquissimis, qui quoad interiora sua cum angelis in 
consortio fuerunt, res Ecclesiae suae, et arcana caelestia involverint numeris, et (x)recondiderint sicut memoriale sibi; inde {10} constare potest quod omnes numeri in Verbo significativi rerum sint, 
nam in Verbo non est vocula quae non significat, scriptum enim est non solum pro hominibus sed etiam simul pro angelis in caelo; inde est Verbum Divinum transiens per omnes caelos. 	[3] Quod omnes 
numeri in Verbo significent res, videatur n. 575, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, 4264, 4495, 4670, 5265, 6175, 9659, quod septem in Verbo involvant sancta, n. 395, 433, 716, 881, 5265, 5268, et quod {11} 
significent integram periodum a principio ad finem, ita statum plenum, n. 6508, 9228, similiter septimana, n. 2044, 3845, quod etiam numerus ternarius, n. 2788, 4495, 4901, 5123, 5159, 7715, 9198, 
9488, 9489, 9825. 	[4] Quod propitiare attinet, significat id purificationem a malis et inde falsis, seu quod idem, remotionem eorum; et quia propitiare et expiare id significat, ideo quoque involvit 
implantationem boni et veri, (c)et conjunctionem utriusque (o)a Domino; quod haec involvat, est causa quia quantum homo purificatur a malis et falsis, tantum implantantur {12} bonum et verum, (c)et 
conjunguntur a Domino; quare posito uno ponitur alterum; Dominus enim apud unumquemvis hominem cum bono amoris {13} est praesens, amat enim omnes, et ex amore vult conjungere (x)illos Sibi, quo fit per 
bonum amoris et verum fidei; sed obstant mala et (o)inde falsa quae homo per vitam mali sibi appropriat, ac inhibent influxum; inde patet quid propitiatio et expiatio; videatur (o)etiam n. 9506. @1
