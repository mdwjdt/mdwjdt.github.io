<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3194节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3194.</strong>“以撒刚从庇耳拉海莱回来”表神圣的理性良善从神圣真理本身生出。这从“以撒”的代表和“刚从庇耳拉海莱回来”的含义清楚可知。“以撒”是指主的神圣理性（参看<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节），在此是指其中神圣良善那一面，因为利百加所代表的神圣真理尚未从属世人中被召唤出来，并与这良善联结；这种联结就是下面几节经文所论述的主题。“刚从庇耳拉海莱回来”是指从神圣真理生出。在原文，“庇耳拉海莱”表看见我的活着的那一位的源泉，如我们在前面所读到的：<br />夏甲就称那对她说话的耶和华名为“你是看见我的神”，因为她说，在这里我也在看见我的那一位后面看见吗？所以，她称那源泉为庇耳拉海莱（即，看见我的活着的那一位的源泉）。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创16.14.htm">14</a>）<br />从前文（<a href="1952.htm">1952</a>-<a href="1958.htm">1958</a>节）可以看出这些话的意思，从那里还明显可知：“源泉”表神圣真理，“看见我的活着的那一位”表神圣理性良善，在那里它被称为主的内层人，源于神圣真理。有关这极深奥秘的情况是这样：良善和真理本质上属于神性本身；但主的神性人从神圣良善出来，从神圣真理生出。或也可说，主的本质存在是神圣良善，主的显化是神圣真理。这就是主神圣理性良善的源头，祂将来自人性的神圣真理联结到这神圣理性良善上。</p>

Isaac came from coming from [or to] Beer-lahai-roi. That this signifies Divine good rational born from Divine truth itself, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord's Divine rational 
(see n. 2083, 2630); here, as to the Divine good therein, because Divine truth called forth out of the natural (which Divine truth is represented by Rebekah) was not as yet conjoined with good; 
this conjunction is treated of in the verses which follow; and also from the signification of "to come from coming from Beer-lahai-roi," as denoting to be born from Divine truth; Beer-lahai-roi in the 
original tongue signifies "the fountain to the Living One that seeth me;" as above (Gen. 16:13-14) where we read: </p>
<p>     Hagar called the name of Jehovah that was speaking unto her, "Thou art the God 
that seeth me; for she said, Have I also here seen after Him that seeth me? Therefore she called the fountain Beer-lahai-roi (the fountain to the Living One that seeth me). What is signified by these 
words may be seen above (n. 1952- 1958); where also it is evident that the "fountain" is Divine truth; and that the "Living One that seeth me" is Divine good rational, which is there called the Lord's 
interior man, from Divine truth. The case in regard to this very deep arcanum is this: The veriest Divine has Good and Truth; the Lord as to the Divine Human came forth from the Divine good, and was 
born of the Divine truth; or what is the same, the very esse [or being] of the Lord was Divine good, and the very existere [or manifestation] was Divine truth; and this was the source of the Lord's Divine 
good rational, with which He conjoined the Divine truth from the Human. </p>

'Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi' means Divine Rational Good born from Divine Truth itself. This is clear from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Lord's Divine Rational, dealt with in <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>, 
here as regards Divine Good there since Divine truth, represented by Rebekah, had not yet been summoned out of the natural and joined to it - that joining together being the subject in what follows 
now; and from the meaning of 'coming from Beer Lahai Roi' as born from Divine Truth. In the original language Beer Lahai Roi means The spring of the Living One who sees me, as above in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2016:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 16:13, 14</a>, 
where one reads, </p>
<p>Hagar called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, You are a God who sees me; for she said, Have I not also here seen after Him who sees me? Therefore she called the spring, Beer 
Lahai Roi (The spring of the Living One who sees me). </p>
<p>For the meaning of these two verses, see <a href="1952.htm">1952</a>-<a href="1958.htm">1958</a>, where also it is evident that 'a spring' means Divine Truth, and that 'the Living One who sees 
me' means Divine Rational Good, which is there called the Lord's Interior man, springing from Divine Truth. The substance of this very deep arcanum is that Good and Truth belong essentially to the 
Divine itself; but the Lord's Divine Human came into existence from Divine Good, and was born from Divine Truth. Or what amounts to the same, the Lord's Essential Being (Esse) was Divine Good, and the 
Manifestation (Existere) of Him was Divine Truth. This was the origin of the Lord's Divine Rational Good to which He joined Divine Truth from the Human. </p>

`Jishak venit a veniendo Beer-lahai-roi': quod significet Divinum Bonum Rationale ex ipso Divino Vero natum, constat ex repraesentatione `Jishaki' quod sit Divinum Rationale Domini, de qua n. 2083, 
2630, hic quoad Divinum Bonum ibi, quia nondum verum Divinum e naturali evocatum, quod per `Rebeccam' repraesentatur, ipsi conjunctum; in his quae nunc sequuntur, de conjunctione agitur; et (c)a significatione 
`venire a veniendo Beer-lahai-roi' quod sit ex Divino Vero natum; Beer-lahai-roi in lingua originali significat fontem vivo videnti me, (s)ut supra Gen. xvi (x)13, 14, ubi legitur, `Hagar vocavit 
nomen Jehovae loquentis ad se, Tu Deus videns me, quia dixit, Num etiam hic vidi post videntem me? propterea vocavit fontem Beer-lahai-roi (fons vivo videnti me)' quae quid significant, videatur 
n. 1952-1958; ibi quoque patet quod `fons' sit Divinum Verum `vivus videns me' quod sit Divinum Bonum Rationale, quod ibi vocatur Domini Interior homo, ex Divino Vero.(s) Cum arcanissimo hoc ita se habet: 
Ipsissimo Divino est Bonum et Verum, Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum exivit ex Divino Bono, et natus ex Divino Vero; seu quod idem, Ipsum Esse Domini erat Divinum Bonum, e Ipsum Existere erat Divinum 
Verum, exinde Divinum Bonum Rationale Domini, cui Divinum Verum ex Humano conjunxit. </p>
