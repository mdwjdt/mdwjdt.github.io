<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9438.</strong>天堂里的人不仅能与来自我们太阳系内星球的天使和灵人交谈、来往，还能与来自这个太阳系之外的宇宙星球的其他人交谈、来往；而且，不仅能与来自那些星球的灵人和天使交谈来往，还能与那里内层打开的居民本身交谈来往，因此他们能听见那些从天堂向他们说话的灵人和天使。人活在世上也能做到这一点，只要主允许他与灵人和天使交谈。因为就其内层而言，人就是一个灵人或天使；他在世上四处携带的身体只是为了他在这最低层的属世或尘世气场履行功能而服务于他。<br />不过，没有人被允许作为一个灵人或天使与灵人和天使交谈，除非他具有这样的品质：他在信和爱上能与他们交通；他不可能拥有这种交通，除非这信是对主之信，爱是对主之爱。因为人通过对主的信，因而通过教义的真理，通过对祂的爱而与主结合；当与祂结合时，他就获得安全，免受来自地狱的恶灵的攻击。其他人不可能拥有打开的内层，因为他们不住在主里面。<br />这就是为何如今很少有人被允许与天使交谈和来往的原因。另一个明显证据可见于这一事实：如今几乎没有人相信灵人和天使的存在，更不用说相信他们与每个人同在，人通过他们与天堂相联，通过天堂与主相联了。人们尤其不相信当人在肉体上死亡后，他会作为一个灵人活着，事实上和以前一样以人形活着。</p>

ON THE EARTHS IN THE STARRY HEAVEN; AND THEIR      INHABITANTS, SPIRITS AND ANGELS. They who are in heaven can speak and be in company with angels and spirits, not only from the earths in this solar 
system, but also with those who are from earths in the universe outside this system; and not only with spirits and angels therefrom, but also with the inhabitants themselves there whose interiors have 
been opened so that they are able to hear those who speak from heaven. The same is possible for a man during his life in the world, to whom it has been granted by the Lord to speak with spirits and 
angels; for as to his interiors a man is a spirit and angel, the body which he carries about in the world being merely of service to him for activities in this natural or earthly sphere, which is the 
ultimate one. [2] But to no one is it given to speak as a spirit and angel with angels and spirits, unless he is of such a character that he can be consociated with them in respect to faith and love; 
and he cannot be so consociated unless he has faith in the Lord and love to the Lord, because a man is conjoined through faith in Him, thus through the truths of doctrine, and through love to Him; and 
when he has been conjoined with Him, he is safe from the attack of evil spirits who are from hell. With others the interiors cannot be opened at all, because they are not in the Lord. [3] This is the 
reason why at the present day it is given to few to speak and be in company with angels. A plain proof of this is that at the present day the existence of spirits and angels is scarcely credited, still 
less that they are with every man, and that through them man has connection with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord. And still less is it believed that when a man dies as to his body, he lives 
a spirit, also in a human form as before. </p>

PLANETS OUT IN SPACE, AND THE INHABITANTS, SPIRITS, AND ANGELS BELONGING TO THEM  </p>
<p>Those who are in heaven are able to talk and mix not only with angels and spirits who come from planets within our 
solar system but also with others who come from planets in the universe outside it, yet not merely with the spirits and angels from those planets but also with the actual inhabitants there whose interiors 
have been opened, so that they can hear spirits and angels from heaven who speak to them. Anyone during his lifetime in the world can in like manner hear them once the Lord has permitted him to 
talk to spirits and angels. For as to his interiors the person is a spirit or angel, the body which he carries around in the world being merely that which is of service to him in the functions he performs 
in this natural or earthly sphere, which is the lowest.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But no one is permitted to talk to spirits and angels as a spirit or angel unless his character is such that he can have fellowship 
with them in faith and love; and he cannot have that fellowship unless the faith is faith in the Lord and the love is love directed to the Lord. For a person is joined to [the Lord] through faith in 
Him, thus through truths that belong to religious teachings, and through love to Him; and when he has been joined to Him he is kept safe from attack by evil spirits from hell. No others can possibly have 
their interiors opened, since they do not abide in the Lord. Here is the reason why few are permitted at the present day to talk to and mix with angels. A clear sign of this may be seen in the fact 
that at the present day there is scarcely any belief in the existence of spirits and angels, let alone a belief that they are present with every individual person, and that through those present with 
him a person is linked to heaven, and through heaven to the Lord. Still less do people believe that when a person dies as to the body, he is alive as a spirit, and indeed in human form as before.  </p>

</p><b>9438.</b>
De Telluribus in Caelo Astrifero; deque eorum incolis, spiritibus et angelis </p>
<p>Qui in caelo sunt, illi loqui et conversari possunt cum angelis et spiritibus qui non solum ex telluribus in solari hoc 
mundo sunt sed etiam cum illis qui ex telluribus extra hunc mundum in universo; nec modo cum spiritibus et angelis inde sed etiam ibi cum ipsis incolis quibus interiora aperta sunt ut possint audire 
loquentes e caelo; similiter potest homo cum vivit in mundo, cui datum est a Domino loqui cum spiritibus et angelis, nam homo est spiritus et angelus quoad interiora sua, corpus quod in mundo circumfert 
modo ei inservit pro functionibus in naturali {1}seu terrestri hac sphaera, quae est ultima. 2 Sed cum angelis et spiritibus nulli datur sicut spiritus et angelus loqui nisi talis sit ut consociari 
possit illis quoad fidem et amorem; nec consociari potest nisi fides sit in Dominum et amor in Dominum, quoniam homo per fidem in Ipsum, ita per vera doctrinae, et per amorem in Ipsum, {2} conjungitur, 
et cum Ipsi conjunctus est, tutus est ab {3} insultu malorum spirituum qui ab inferno; apud alios interiora aperiri prorsus nequeunt, nam non in Domino sunt. 3 Haec causa est quod {4}pauci sint 
hodie quibus datur loqui et conversari cum angelis; cujus rei manifestum indicium est quod vix credatur hodie quod spiritus et angeli sint, minus quod sint apud quemcumque hominem, et quod per illos nexus 
sit homini cum caelo, et per caelum cum Domino; et quod adhuc minus credatur quod homo cum quoad corpus moritur, vivat spiritus, etiam in humana forma sicut prius. </p>
