<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第647节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>647.</strong>这些细节有这样的含义，也就是说，数字三百、五十、三十表示余留，尤其是它们寥寥无几，以及“长、宽、高”表示圣洁、真理和良善。这一切看似不可思议，牵强附会。但除了前面有关数字的所述所示（即本章第3节，“120”表信的余留）之外，这个问题从以下事实也清楚可知，即如善灵和天使那样拥有内义之人，会超越诸如尘世、肉体和纯世俗之类的一切事物，因而超越诸如涉及数字和度量之类的一切事物。然而，主能使他们充分领悟圣言，并且完全脱离这类事物。既如此，那么很明显，数字和度量涉及属天和属灵之物。不过，后者与字义相去甚远，以至于这类事物根本不可能被看到。这适用于每一个属天或属灵之物。谁都能由此意识到，想要通过感官和知识来探究信的问题，并且若不能以这种方式来理解就拒绝相信是何等疯狂！</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]647.</strong> The symbolism assigned here must necessarily seem bizarre and far-fetched to any reader. It must be hard to accept, for instance, that three hundred, fifty, and thirty symbolize the remaining traces and how few they were. The same for the symbolism of length, width, and height as holiness, truth, and goodness.<br />But in the first place, see the statements and proofs concerning numbers above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_647/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>3</a> of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_647/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575" target=_top>575</a>], which showed that one hundred twenty there symbolizes remaining traces of faith. In the second place, anyone can achieve clarity on this point who considers that people intent on the inner meaning, as good spirits and angels are, look beyond everything tied to the earth, the body, and the world alone. Accordingly they look beyond everything connected with numbers and measurement, and yet the Lord gives them a full perception of the Word's message, even though they are completely detached from such things. This being true, those details obviously must involve heavenly and spiritual concerns so remote from the literal meaning that we cannot even see they are meant. All heavenly and spiritual matters are like this, without exception.<br />Now you can see how insane it is to try to inquire into faith through the use of empirical data and factual knowledge and to believe nothing until this method allows you to grasp it. </p>

That these particulars have such a signification, as that the numbers "three hundred" "fifty" and "thirty" signify remains, and that they are few; and that "length" "breadth" and "height" signify holiness, 
truth, and good, cannot but appear strange to everyone, and very remote from the letter. But in addition to what was said and shown above concerning numbers (at verse 3 of this chapter, that a 
"hundred and twenty" there signify remains of faith), it may be evident to everyone also from the fact that they who are in the internal sense, as are good spirits and angels, are beyond all such things 
as are earthly, corporeal, and merely of the world, and thus are beyond all matters of number and measure, and yet it is given them by the Lord to perceive the Word fully, and this entirely apart from 
such things. And this being true, it may therefore be very evident that these particulars involve things celestial and spiritual which are so remote from the sense of the letter that it cannot even 
appear that there are such things. Such are celestial and spiritual things both in general and in particular. And from this a man may know how insane it is to desire to search into those things which 
are matters of faith, by means of the things of sense and knowledge [sensualia et scientifica]; and to be unwilling to believe unless he apprehends them in this way. </p>

It is bound to seem strange and very far-fetched to everybody that these details have this meaning, that is to say, that the numbers three hundred, fifty, and thirty mean remnants, and in particular 
that they were few; also that 'length, breadth, and height' means holiness, truth, and good. But in addition to what has been stated and shown above about numbers at verse 3 of this chapter, where a hundred 
and twenty means the remnants of faith, this matter may also become clear to anybody from the fact that people who possess the internal sense, as good spirits and angels do, are beyond anything 
earthly, bodily, or purely worldly, and so beyond anything involving numbers and measurements. Yet the Lord enables them to perceive the Word fully, and to do so quite independently from such concepts. 
This being so, it becomes quite clear that numbers and measurements embody celestial and spiritual things. The latter however are so remote from the sense of the letter that such things cannot possibly 
be seen. This applies to every single celestial or spiritual thing. From this also anyone may recognize how insane it is to desire to inquire into matters of faith through sensory evidence and factual 
knowledge and to refuse to believe unless one grasps them by that method. </p>

</p><b>647.</b>
Quod haec talia significent, non potest non unicuique peregrinum et remotissimum apparere, ut quod numeri 'trecenti, et quinquaginta, et triginta' significent reliquias et quidem paucas; tum quod 'longitudo, 
latitudo et altitudo' significent sanctum, verum et bonum: sed praeter quae dicta et ostensa supra sunt de numeris, ad vers. 3 hujus capitis, quod ibi 'centum et viginti' significent reliquias 
fidei, etiam constare unicuique potest ex eo quod qui in sensu interna sunt, ut spiritus boni et angeli, extra omnia illa sint quae terrestria: corporea et mere mundana, ita extra omnia quae sunt numerorum 
et mensurarum, et tamen illis datur a Domino percipere Verbum plene: et quidem prorsus abstracte a talibus; et quia hoc verum, inde manifeste constare potest quod caelestia et spiritualia involvant; 
quae ita remota sunt a sensu litterae ut ne quidem apparere possit quod talia sint; sicut sunt caelestia et spiritualia omnia et singula; exinde quoque scire potest homo quam vesanum sit velle 
explorare illa quae sunt fidei per sensualia et scientifica, et non prius credere quam sic illa capiat. </p>
