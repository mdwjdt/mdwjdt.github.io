<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4939节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4939.</strong>有一次，当我被提入天堂时，我觉得我的头似乎在那里，而我的身体在它下面，我的脚在更下面。我由此觉察人里面的高级和低级事物如何对应于大人里面的这些事物，一个又如何流入另一个，也就是说，属天之物，即爱之良善和次序的第一层级如何流入属灵之物，即源于那良善的真理和次序的第二层级，最后又如何流入属世之物，即次序的第三层级。由此明显可知，属世事物就像脚，支撑高级事物止于其上。更重要的是，灵界与天堂终止于自然界。正因如此，整个自然界是代表主国度的一个舞台，其中的一切事物都是代表（<a href="2758.htm">2758</a>，<a href="3483.htm">3483</a>节）。自然界照这种次序凭流注持续存在，没有这种流注，它甚至无法存活片刻。</p>

Once when I was elevated into heaven, it appeared to me as if I were there with my head, and below with my body, but with my feet still lower. And from this it was perceived how the higher and lower 
things in man correspond to those which are in the Grand Man, and how the one flows into the other, namely, that the celestial, which is the good of love and the first in order, flows into the spiritual, 
which is the truth thence derived and the second in order, and finally into the natural, which is the third in order. From this it is evident that natural things are like the feet, on which the higher 
things rest. Nature also is that in which the spiritual world and heaven terminate. Thence it is that universal nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom, and that everything in it 
is representative (n. 2758, 3483); and that nature subsists from influx according to this order, and that without such influx it could not subsist even for a moment. </p>

Once when I had been raised up to heaven it seemed to me as though my head was there, but that my body was below it, and my feet even further below. From this I had a perception of how the higher and 
lower things present in the human being correspond to the same in the Grand Man, and how one flows into another; that is to say, how the celestial, which is the good of love and the first degree of order, 
flows into the spiritual, which is truth springing from that good and the second degree of order, and then into the natural, which is the third degree of order. From this it is evident that natural 
things are like the feet on which the higher things support themselves. What is more, things in the spiritual world and those in heaven are ringed about by the natural world. Consequently the whole 
natural system is a theatre representative of the Lord's kingdom, every individual part of it being representative, <a href="2758.htm">2758</a>, <a href="3483.htm">3483</a>. The natural system is kept in being by an influx conforming to that order, 
and without this influx it could not remain in being for even a single moment. </p>

</p><b>4939.</b>
Semel cum elevatus essem in caelum, apparuit mihi sicut capite ibi essem, et corpore infra, at pedibus adhuc inferius; et inde perceptum quomodo superiora et inferiora apud hominem correspondent 
illis (o)quae in Maximo Homine, et quomodo influit {1} unum in alterum, quod nempe caeleste quod est bonum amoris et primum ordinis, influat in spirituale quod est verum inde, et est secundum ordinis, 
et denique in naturale quod est tertium ordinis; </p>
<p>inde patet quod naturalia sint instar pedum, quibus innituntur superiora; natura etiam est in qua terminatur illa {4} quae spiritualis mundi sunt, 
et quae caeli; inde est quod universa natura sit theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini, et quod singula ibi repraesentent, n. 2758, 3483; et quod natura ex influxu secundum illum ordinem subsistat, 
et quod absque (t)influxu illo ne quidem momento subsistere posset. @1 intima$ @2 naturalia$ @3 influunt$ @4 illae I$ </p>
