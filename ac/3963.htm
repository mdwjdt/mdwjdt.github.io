<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3963节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3963.</strong>“后来又生了一个女儿”表对所有这些纯正真理的情感，也表有良善存在于其中的信仰的教会。这从“女儿”的含义清楚可知，“女儿”是指情感，也指教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。至于是哪种情感和哪种教会，这可从加在“女儿”这个词上的事物明显看出来。例如，当加上“锡安”，即被称为“锡安的女儿（或译为锡安的女子）”时，所指的是属天教会；当加上“耶路撒冷”，即被称为“耶路撒冷的女儿（或译为耶路撒冷的女子）”时，所指的是属灵教会，其它情况也是如此。此处什么也没加，“女儿”就表示有良善存在于其中的信仰的教会。因为到目前为止，所论述的主题一直是构成有良善存在于其中的信仰的一般真理，以及对这些真理的接受和承认；也就是说，雅各的上述“十个儿子”表示这些真理，如前所示。由于这些儿子之后，紧接着经上就提到女儿的出生，故从整个思路明显可知，这表示所有这些真理存在于其中的教会。<br />无论我们说有良善存在于其中的信仰的教会，还是说属灵教会，又或说对所有这一切，也就是对所有这些一般真理的情感，意思都一样。因为教会存在凭的是对有良善在其中的真理的情感和对真理所源于的良善的情感，而不是凭着对没有良善在其中的真理的情感，也不是凭着对真理所未源于的良善的情感。那些处于对真理的情感，却未处于真理的良善，也就是没有照真理生活的人声称他们属于教会，是大错特错了。他们虽在会众中，却在教会之外，因为他们陷入对邪恶的情感，而真理不可能与邪恶结合。他们对真理的情感并非源于主，而是源于他们自己；因为他们关心的是自己，意图利用真理赚取名声，由此赚取荣耀和财富。他们并不关心教会，也不关心主的国度，更不用说主了。而那些处于对真理所未源于的良善的情感之人也不属于教会，尽管他们也在会众中；因为他们处于属世良善，并未处于属灵良善，并且允许自己被引入各种邪恶和虚假，只要邪恶看上去像良善，虚假看上去像真理 （参看<a href="3470.htm">3470</a>，<a href="3471.htm">3471</a>，<a href="3518.htm">3518</a>节）。</p>

And afterwards she bare a daughter. That this signifies the affection of all these general truths; and also the church of faith in which there is good, is evident from the signification of a "daughter," 
as being affection, and also the church (see n. 2362); but the affection of what, and what kind of church, appears from what is added-as the celestial church when "Zion" is added, which is called 
the "daughter of Zion," and the spiritual church when "Jerusalem" is added, which is called the "daughter of Jerusalem;" and so in other cases. Here, where nothing is added, the church of faith in which 
there is good is signified by "daughter;" for up to this point the general truths of faith within which there is good have been described, and their reception and acknowledgment; these truths being 
signified by the "ten sons" of Jacob; and as immediately after them a daughter is said to have been born, it is evident from the series that this means the church in which are all these truths.  [2] 
Whether we speak of the church of faith in which there is good, or of the spiritual church, it is the same; and also if we speak of the affection of all, that is, of all these general truths; for the 
church exists from the affection of truth in which there is good, and the affection of good from which is truth; but not from the affection of truth in which there is not good, nor from the affection 
of good from which is not truth. They who say that they are of the church, being in the affection of truth and not in the good of truth, that is, who do not live according to truths, are much mistaken. 
These are outside the church, although within its congregation; for they are in the affection of evil, with which truth cannot be conjoined. Their affection of truth is not from the Lord, but from 
themselves; for they have regard to themselves, to the intent that by the knowledges of truth they may gain reputation, and thereby honors and wealth; but they have no regard to the church, nor to the 
Lord's kingdom, and still less to the Lord. But they who are in the affection of good from which there is not truth, are not of the church, although within its congregation; for they are in natural and 
not spiritual good, and suffer themselves to be led into every kind of evil and falsity, if only the appearance of good is induced upon the evil, and the appearance of truth upon the falsity (see n. 
3470, 3471, 3518). </p>

'Afterwards she bore a daughter' means the affection for all these, and also means the Church of faith in which good is present. This is clear from the meaning of 'a daughter' as an affection, and also 
as a Church, dealt with in <a href="2363.htm">2363</a>. But as to what the object of the affection is, or what kind of Church is meant, this is evident from whatever is added on to the word 'daughter'. For example, it is 
evident from the addition of 'Zion' after 'daughter' that the celestial Church, which is called 'the daughter of Zion', is meant; from the addition of 'Jerusalem' that the spiritual Church, which is 
referred to as 'the daughter of Jerusalem', is meant, and so on. In the present verse, in which nothing is added on to it, 'daughter' means the Church of faith in which good is present. For up to this 
point the subject has been the general truths which constitute faith in which good is present, and the reception and acknowledgement of those truths, that is to say, the truths that were meant, as has 
been shown, by the ten sons of Jacob dealt with above. And since immediately after these sons reference is made to the birth of a daughter it is evident from the train of thought that a Church is meant 
in which all these truths are present. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Whether you call it the Church of faith in which good is present, or you call it the spiritual Church, it amounts to the same; or again if you call it 
the affection for all these, that is, all these general truths. For it is from the affection for truth it' which good is present, and the affection for good from which truth springs, that the Church 
has its being, not from the affection for truth in which good is not present or the affection for good from which truth does not spring. People who are governed by an affection for truth but not by the 
good from which truth springs, that is, who do not live according to truths, are much mistaken when they say that they belong to the Church. Though within a congregation, they are outside the Church, 
for they are governed by the affection for evil to which truth cannot be joined. Their affection for truth does not originate in the Lord but in themselves, for they have themselves in view, their intention 
being by means of the truth they know to earn repute, and thereby important positions and wealth. But they do not have the Church in view, or the Lord's kingdom, let alone the Lord. But people 
governed by the affection for good from which truth does not spring do not belong to the Church even though they are within a congregation, for they are governed by natural good, not by spiritual, and 
allow themselves to be led into every kind of evil and also of falsity, provided that evil is made to look like good and falsity to look like truth, see <a href="3470.htm">3470</a>, <a href="3471.htm">3471</a>, <a href="3518.htm">3518</a>. </p>

`Postea peperit filiam':  quod significet affectionem omnium, tum Ecclesiam fidei in qua bonum, constat a significatione `filiae' quod sit affectio, tum Ecclesia, de qua n. 2362, sed cujus rei affectio, 
ac qualis Ecclesia, ex adjectis {1}patet, sicut Ecclesia caelestis ex adjecta Zione, quae filia Zionis vocatur, Ecclesia spiritualis ex adjecta Hierosolyma, quae filia Hierosolymae dicitur, 
et sic porro; hic ubi nihil adjectum est, significatur per filiam Ecclesia fidei in qua bonum; de communibus enim veris quae sunt fidei in qua bonum, et de eorum receptione et agnitione huc usque 
actum est, illa nempe vera per `decem filios Jacobi,' de quibus {2}supra, significata sunt, ut {3}ostensum est; </p>
<p>et quia immediate post illos memoratur filia {4}quod nata, ex serie patet quod sit Ecclesia, 
in qua illa omnia; [2] sive dicas Ecclesiam fidei in qua bonum, sive Ecclesiam spiritualem, idem est, et quoque si dicas affectionem omnium, nempe communium verorum; nam ex affectione veri 
in quo bonum, et boni ex quo verum, est Ecclesia; non autem ex affectione veri in quo non bonum, nec ex affectione boni ex quo non verum; qui se dicunt ab Ecclesia esse, qui in affectione veri sunt 
et non in bono veri, hoc est, non vivunt secundum vera, multum falluntur; sunt extra Ecclesiam tametsi intra coetum sunt, sunt enim in affectione mali, cum quo verum non conjungi potest; affectio 
veri eorum non est ex Domino sed est ex se, nam semet spectant ut per cognitiones veri lucrentur famam, et inde honores et opes, non autem spectant Ecclesiam, nec regnum Domini, minus Dominum; qui 
autem in affectione boni sunt ex quo non verum, nec illi ab Ecclesia sunt tametsi intra coetum, nam in bono naturali sunt non in bono spirituali, ac in {5}quodlibet malum et quoque falsum se duci patiuntur, 
modo inducatur malo species boni, et falso species veri, de quibus videatur n. 3470, 3471, 3518. @1 in Verbo$ @2 hucusque$ @3 i supra$ @4 quae$ @5 quodcunque$ </p>
