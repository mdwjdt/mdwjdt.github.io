<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8559节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8559.</strong>“按着站口”表照着为接受天堂生命的生命秩序。这从“站口”的含义清楚可知，“站口”是指属灵生命的进一步发展，如刚才所述（<a href="8557.htm">8557</a>节），因而是指那生命的秩序（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>节）。这是为接受天堂的生命，原因是生命作为主的一个礼物通过以色列人在旷野的漂流所描述的试探而被赐给人。天堂的生命就在于被主通过良善引导；一个人若要获得那生命，良善必须真理被植入；也就是说，仁必须通过信被植入。只要做到这一点，此人便踏上了通往天堂的路，但尚未到达天堂。为叫那时信之真理能得以证实，还能与良善结合，此人被带入试探，因为这些试探是良善与真理结合的手段。因此，当这人处于良善，也就是处于对为了良善，因而为了邻舍而行良善的情感时，他就被提入天堂，因为他处于天堂的秩序，并被主通过良善引导。这一切清楚表明何谓“天堂的生命”。</p>

After their journeys. That this signifies according to the order of life for receiving the life of heaven, is evident from the signification of "journeys," as being what is progressive of spiritual life 
(of which just above, n. 8557), thus the order of that life (n. 1293). That it denotes for receiving the life of heaven, is because that life is a gift of the Lord to man by means of the temptations 
that are described by the journeys of the sons of Israel in the wilderness. The life of heaven is to be led of the Lord by means of good. In order that a man may come to that life, good must be implanted 
by means of truth; that is, charity by means of faith. So long as this is being done, the man is in the way to heaven, but is not yet in heaven. And in order that at that time the truths which 
are of faith may be confirmed, and may also be conjoined with good, the man is let into temptations, for these are the means of the conjunction of good and truth. When therefore the man is in good, that 
is, in the affection of doing good for the sake of good, thus for the sake of the neighbor, he is uplifted into heaven, for he is in the order of heaven, and is led of the Lord by means of good. From 
all this it can be seen what is meant by "the life of heaven." </p>

'According to their travels' means according to the order of life for receiving the life of heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'travels' as further development of spiritual life, dealt with just 
above in <a href="8557.htm">8557</a>, thus the order of that life, <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>. The reason why it is for the purpose of receiving the life of heaven is that temptations, which the travels of the children of Israel in the wilderness 
depict, are the means by which the Lord imparts that life to a person. The life of heaven consists in being led by the Lord through good; and if a person is to attain that life, good must be implanted 
through truth, that is, charity through faith. As long as this is being done a person is on the road to heaven, but is not as yet in heaven. In order that the truths of faith may be corroborated 
and also linked to good, a person is pitched into temptations, for these serve as the means by which goodness and truth are joined together. When therefore a person is governed by good, that is, by an 
affection for doing good for its own sake, and so for his neighbour's sake, he is raised into heaven, since the order of heaven governs him and he is being led by the Lord through good. All this makes 
clear what one should understand by the life of heaven. </p>

`Secundum profectiones': quod significet secundum vitae ordinem ad caeli vitam accipiendam, constat ex significatione `profectionum' quod sint progressivum vitae spiritualis, de qua mox supra n. 8557, 
ita vitae illius ordo, n. 1293; quod sit ad caeli vitam {1}accipiendam, est quia ea vita donatur homini a Domino per tentationes, quae describuntur per profectiones filiorum Israelis in deserto.  Vita 
caeli est duci a Domino per bonum; {2}ut ad illam vitam veniat homo, {3}implantabitur bonum per verum, hoc est, charitas per fidem; quamdiu {4}hoc fit, homo in via ad caelum est, sed nondum in caelo; 
utque tunc vera quae fidei confirmentur, et quoque conjungantur bono, mittitur homo in tentationes, nam hae sunt media conjunctionis boni et veri; {5} cum itaque homo in bono est, hoc est, in affectione 
faciendi bonum propter bonum, ita propter proximum, tunc {6}in caelum elevatur, est enim in ordine caeli, et per bonum a Domino ducitur; ex his constare potest quid {7} intelligitur per vitam caeli. 	@1
