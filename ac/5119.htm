<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5119节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5119.</strong>“我就拿葡萄挤在法老的杯里”表进入拥有属灵源头的善行中的相互流注。这从“葡萄”和“挤在法老的杯里”的含义清楚可知：“葡萄”是指仁爱的善行，如刚才所述（<a href="5117.htm">5117</a>节），因而是指拥有属灵源头的善行，因为一切真正仁爱的善行都来自这个源头；“挤在法老的杯里”是指相互流注。“相互流注”不是指外层属世层流入内层属世层，因为这是不可能的。外层事物绝无可能流入内层事物；或也可说，低层事物，或在后之物绝无可能流入高层事物或在先之物；但是，当理性层召唤出存在于内层属世层中的事物，并通过内层属世层召唤出存在于外层属世层中的事物时，相互流注就会发生。并不是说它召唤出实际存在于那里的事物，而是说召唤出从那里的事物推断，或也可说提取出来的东西。这就是相互流注的性质。<br />这看上去就像世上的事物经由感官流入内层，但这是一个感官错觉。真相是：内层流入外层，这流注使得洞察力得以产生。我好几次与灵人讨论这些问题，并通过活生生的经历被指示：内层人在外层里面看见并洞察发生在外层人之外的事，感官生命并没有其它源头；也就是说，以感官觉知的能力或实际的感官觉知没有其它任何源头。但这种错觉具有这样的性质，并且力量如此之大，以致它绝无可能从属世人那里被逐出，甚至不能从理性人那里被逐出，除非理性人能被置于感官印象之外，或从感官之物中抽象出来思考。提及这一切是为了说明何为相互流注。</p>

And I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup. That this signifies reciprocal influx into the goods from a spiritual origin there, is evident from the signification of "grapes," as being 
the goods of charity (of which just above, n. 5117), thus goods from a spiritual origin, for all the goods of genuine charity are from this source; and from the signification of "pressing into Pharaoh's 
cup," as being reciprocal influx. By reciprocal influx it is not meant that the exterior natural flows into the interior, because this is impossible; for exterior things cannot possibly flow into 
interior things; or what is the same thing, lower or posterior things into higher and prior ones; but the rational calls forth the things which are in the interior natural, and by means of this the things 
which are in the exterior; not that the things themselves which are therein are called forth, but that which has been concluded or as it were extracted from them. Such is the nature of reciprocal 
influx. It appears as if the things which are in the world flow in through the senses toward the interiors, but this is a fallacy of sense; the influx is of interiors into exteriors, and by means of 
this influx, perception. On these subjects I have at times conversed with spirits; and it was shown by living experience that the interior man sees and perceives in the exterior what is done outside of 
this, and that the sensuous has life from no other source, or that from no other source is the faculty of sense, or sensation. But this fallacy is of such a nature, and so great, that it can by no means 
be dispelled by the natural man, and not even by the rational unless this is able to think abstractedly from what is sensuous. These things are said in order that it may be known what reciprocal 
influx is. </p>

'And I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup means a reciprocal influx into good deeds that have a spiritual origin. This is clear from the meaning of 'grapes' as the good deeds of charity, 
dealt with just above in <a href="5117.htm">5117</a>, and so as good deeds that have a spiritual origin, since every good deed of genuine charity originates there; and from the meaning of 'pressing into Pharaoh's cup' 
as a reciprocal influx. The expression 'reciprocal influx' does not mean that the exterior natural flows into the interior natural, for that is not possible. Exterior things cannot by any means flow into 
interior ones, or what amounts to the same, lower or posterior things into higher or prior ones. The reciprocal influx takes place when the rational calls forth things present in the interior natural, 
and also, by means of the interior natural, those present in the exterior natural. Not that it calls forth what actually exists there but what is deduced or so to speak extracted from what is there. 
This is what the reciprocal influx is. </p>

 It does seem as though things in the world pass by way of the senses into what is present within; but that is an illusion of the senses. The reality is 
that what exists within flows into what is outward, and that this influx is what enables discernment to take place. I have discussed these matters with spirits on several occasions and have been shown 
through actual experiences that the interior man sees and discerns within the exterior man what is taking place outside the exterior man, and that the life of the senses has no other origin; that is, 
neither the ability to perceive with the senses nor actual sensory perception has any other origin. But the nature and power of this illusion are such that it cannot by any means be banished from the 
natural man, nor even from the rational, unless the rational man can be made to stand aside from sensory impressions. All this has been mentioned to show what reciprocal influx is. </p>

`Et accepi uvas et expressi illas in scyphum Pharaonis': </p>
<p>quod significet influxum reciprocum in bona ex origine spirituali ibi, constat ex significatione `uvarum' quod sint bona charitatis, de qua 
mox supra n. 5117, ita bona ex origine spirituali, omnia enim bona genuinae charitatis inde sunt; et ex significatione `exprimere in scyphum Pharaonis' quod sit influxus reciprocus. Per influxum reciprocum 
non intelligitur quod naturale exterius influat in interius, quia hoc impossibile est; exteriora enim nequaquam possunt influere in interiora, seu quod idem, inferiora aut posteriora in superiora 
aut priora; sed a rationali evocantur illa quae in interiore naturali sunt, et per hoc quae in exteriore {1}; </p>
<p>non quod ipsa illa quae ibi sunt, evocentur, sed quae ab illis concluduntur seu 
quasi extrahuntur; talis est influxus reciprocus. [2] Apparet sicut illa quae in mundo sunt, influant per sensualia versus interiora{2}, sed est fallacia sensus; est influxus interiorum in exteriora, 
et per illum influxum apperceptio; de his aliquoties cum spiritibus in sermone fui, et ostensum per vivas experientias quod interior homo videat et appercipiat in exteriore quid peragitur extra 
hunc, et quod non aliunde sit vita sensuali, seu quod non aliunde sit facultas sentiendi, nec sensatio; sed haec fallacia talis et tanta est ut nequaquam possit a naturali homine discuti et ne quidem 
a rationali, nisi hic abstracte a sensuali cogitare possit. Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quid influxus reciprocus. @1 i sunt$ @2 i sic ut influxus sit exteriorum in interiora$ </p>
