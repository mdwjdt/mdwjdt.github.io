<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2368节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2368．创世记19:9.</strong> 他们说，退后！又说，这个寄居的人，竟作起审判官来！现在我们要害你比害他们更甚。他们就按住这人，强压罗得，要前来攻破房门。<br />“他们说”表愤怒的回答。“退后”表他们愤怒的威胁。“又说，这个寄居的人”表那些具有不同教义和生活的人。“竟作起审判官来”表他们竟教训起我们来。“现在我们要害你比害他们更甚”表他们拒绝仁之善比拒绝主的神圣人性和神圣活动更甚。“他们就按住这人”表他们想对真理诉诸暴力。“强压罗得”表他们尤其想对仁之善诉诸暴力。“要前来攻破房门”表他们甚至试图竭力摧毁这二者。</p>

Verse 9. And they said, Come on. And they said is one come to sojourn, and shall he judge indeed? Now will we do worse to thee than to them. And they pressed upon the man, upon Lot, exceedingly; and 
drew near to break open the door. "And they said," signifies a reply from anger; "Come on," signifies the threats of their anger. And they said, "Is one come to sojourn," signifies those who are of another 
doctrine and another life; "and shall he judge indeed?" signifies shall they teach us? "Now will we do worse to thee than to them," signifies that they would reject the good of charity more than 
the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding; "and they pressed upon the man," signifies that they desired to offer violence to truth; "upon Lot exceedingly," signifies most especially to the good of 
charity; "and drew near to break open the door," signifies that they came even to the endeavor to destroy both. </p>

Verse 9 And they said, Stand back. And they said, Did not this one come to sojourn, and will he surely judge? Now we will do more harm to you than to them. And they pressed on the man, on Lot forcefully, 
and came near to break down the door (ostium). </p>
<p>'And they said' means the reply made in anger. 'Stand back' means their angry threats. 'And they said, Did not this one come to sojourn' means people 
with different teaching and a different life. 'And will he surely judge?' means, Will they teach us? 'Now we will do more harm to you than to them' means that they would reject the good of charity 
even more than they rejected the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. 'And they pressed on the men' means that they wished to resort to violence against truth. 'On Lot forcefully' means to do 
so most of all against the good of charity. 'And they came near to break down the door' means that they went so far as to try and destroy them both. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2368</b>
</p><b>2368.</b>
Vers. 9.  Et dixerunt, Accede ultra, et dixerunt, Num unus venit ad peregrinandum, et judicabit judicando?  Nunc malefaciemus tibi prae illis; et urserunt in virum, in Lot valde, et accesserunt ad effringendum 
ostium. `Et dixerunt' significat responsum ex ira: `accede ultra' significat minas irae eorum: `et dixerunt, Num unus venit ad peregrinandum' significat qui alia doctrina et alia vita: `et 
judicabit judicando?' significat num illi docebunt nos? `Nunc malefaciemus tibi prae illis' significat quod bonum charitatis magis rejicerent quam Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini: `et urserunt 
in virum' significat quod vim inferre vellent vero: `in Lot valde' significat quod maxime bono charitatis: et accesserunt ad effringendum ostium' significat quod venirent usque ad conatum destruendi 
utrumque. </p>
