<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7021节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7021.</strong>“因为寻索你灵魂的人都死了”表努力摧毁真理与良善之生命的虚假的移除。这从“死了”、埃及人和“寻索灵魂的人”的含义清楚可知：“死了”是指他们被移除，因为死了的人也被移除；埃及人，即此处的“人”，是指那些陷入虚假的人（参看<a href="6692.htm">6692</a>节）；“寻索灵魂的人”是指那些努力摧毁生命的人。由于属灵生命是属于信的真理和属于仁的良善的生命，故我们说“真理与良善的生命”。由此明显可知，“寻索你灵魂的人都死了”表示努力摧毁真理与良善之生命的虚假的移除。在圣言中，“灵魂”表示一切活物，它也被归于生物或动物。但严格来说，“灵魂”只论及人；当论及人时，这个词具有各种含义。人自己就被称为一个“灵魂”，因为总的来说，他的生命被称为灵魂；具体来说，其理解力的生命或活动也被称为灵魂，其意愿的生命或活动同样被称为灵魂。<br />但就灵义而言，“灵魂”表示属于信的真理的生命和属于仁的良善的生命，一般表示就其死后的灵而言，一个人自己；以下经文中的“灵魂”就具有这层意义：<br />那能杀身体不能杀灵魂的，不要怕他们。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.28.htm">10:28</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />人若赚得全世界，却害了自己的灵魂，有什么益处呢？人还能拿什么作救赎灵魂的足价呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.26.htm">16:26</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />人子来不是要灭人的灵魂，是要救人的灵魂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.56.htm">9:56</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />你们在我民中亵渎我，杀死不该死的灵魂，救活不该活的灵魂。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.19.htm">13:19</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“灵魂”表示人的属灵生命，这生命是死后其灵的生命。“杀死灵魂”、“失丧灵魂”、“灭灵魂”表示灵性的死亡，也就是受诅。</p>

Because all the men seeking thy soul are dead. That this signifies the removal of the falsities that are endeavoring to destroy the life of truth and good, is evident from the signification of "being 
dead," as being that they are removed, for they who are dead have also been removed; from the signification of the "Egyptians," who here are "the men," as being those who are in falsities (see n. 6692); 
and from the signification of "those seeking the soul," as being those who are endeavoring to destroy the life. And as spiritual life is the life of the truth that is of faith, and of the good that 
is of charity, it is therefore said "the life of truth and good." From this it is evident that by "all the men seeking thy soul are dead" is signified the removal of the falsities that are endeavoring 
to destroy the life of truth and good. By "soul" in the Word is meant every living thing, and it is attributed also to animals, but "soul" is properly predicated of man, and when of man, the term is 
used in various senses. Man himself is called a "soul," because his life in general is so called, also specifically his intellectual life, or understanding, and likewise his voluntary life, or will. [2] 
But in the spiritual sense by "soul" is meant the life of the truth which is of faith, and of the good which is of charity, and in general the man himself as to his spirit which lives after death, 
in which sense it is used in these passages: </p>
<p>     Be not afraid of those who are able to kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul (Matt. 10:28).      What doth it profit a man, if he gain 
the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what price shall a man give sufficient for the redemption of his soul? (Matt. 16:26).      The Son of man is not come to destroy men's souls, but to save them 
(Luke 9:56).      Ye have profaned Me among My people, to slay the souls that ought not to die, and to make the souls to live that ought not to live (Ezek. 13:19). In these passages the "soul" denotes 
the spiritual life of man, which life is that of his spirit after death. "To kill the soul," "to lose the soul," "to destroy the soul," denote to die spiritually, that is, to be damned. </p>

'For all the men seeking your soul are dead' means the removal of falsities endeavouring to destroy the life of truth and good. This is clear from the meaning of 'being dead' as the fact that they have 
been removed, since those who are dead have also been removed; from the meaning of the Egyptians, to whom 'the men' refers here, as those who are under the influence of falsities, dealt with in <a href="6692.htm">6692</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'those seeking the soul' as those who endeavour to destroy life. And since spiritual life is the life of truth which belongs to faith and of good which belongs to charity, it 
is called the life of truth and good. From all this it is evident that 'all the men seeking your soul are dead' means the removal of falsities endeavouring to destroy the life of truth and good. In 
the Word 'soul' (anima) is used to mean every living thing and is also attributed to living creatures (animalia). But the proper use of the word 'soul' is in reference to a human being; and when used 
in this way it can vary in meaning. A person himself is called a soul, because the life in general within him is called the soul; more specifically the life or activity of his understanding is called 
such, and so too is the life or activity of his will.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But in the spiritual sense 'soul' is used to mean the life of truth belonging to faith and the life of good belonging to charity, or in general 
to mean a person himself in respect of his spirit that lives after death, which is the meaning that 'soul' has in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not fear those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
What does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but suffers the loss of his soul? Or what will a person give as a price sufficient for the redemption of his 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
The Son of Man did not come to destroy people's souls but to save them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:56&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:56</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You have desecrated Me among My people, to kill souls that ought not 
to die, and to keep alive souls that ought not to live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2013:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 13:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In these places 'soul' stands for a person's spiritual life, the life which is that of his spirit after death. 'Killing the soul', 
'suffering the loss of one's soul', and 'destroying the soul' stand for dying spiritually or being subject to damnation. </p>

`Quia mortui sunt omnes viri quaerentes animam tuam': quod significet remotionem falsorum vitam veri et boni destruere conantium, constat ex significatione `mortui esse' quod sit quod remoti, nam qui 
mortui sunt, illi quoque remoti sunt; ex significatione `Aegyptiorum,' qui hic sunt viri, quod sint qui in falsis, de qua n. 6692; et ex significatione `quaerentium animam' quod sit qui vitam destruere 
conantur; et quia vita spiritualis est vita veri quae fidei et boni quae charitatis, ideo dicitur vita veri et boni; inde patet quod per quod `mortui sint omnes viri quaerentes animam tuam' significetur 
remotio falsorum vitam veri et boni destruere conantium.  Per `animam' in Verbo intelligitur omne vivum, ac tribuitur {1}quoque animalibus, at (x)proprie {2}dicitur anima de homine', et cum {3}de 
homine, in vario sensu; ipse homo vocatur anima quia ejus vita in communi; tum ejus vita intellectualis in specie, seu intellectus, et quoque ejus vita voluntaria seu voluntas; sed in spirituali sensu 
per `animam' intelligitur 2 vita veri quae fidei, et boni quae charitatis; et in genere ipse homo quoad spiritum suum, qui vivit post mortem; in quo sensu apud Matthaeum, Ne timete vobis ab iis qui 
occidere corpus possunt, animam vero occidere non possunt, x 28: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Quid prodest homini, si totum mundum lucratus fuerit, animae autem jacturam fecerit? aut quod dabit homo pretium sufficiens 
redemptionis animae suae? (x)xvi 26: </p>
<p>apud Lucam, Filius hominis non venit ad perdendum animas hominum, sed ad servandum, ix 56: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, Profanastis Me apud populum Meum, ad occidendum 
animas quae non mori debent; et ad vivificandum animas quae non vivere debent, xiii 19; </p>
<p>in illis locis `anima' pro hominis vita spirituali, quae vita est spiritus ejus post mortem {4}; `occidere 
animam,' `jacturam animae facere,' `perdere animam,' pro mori spiritualiter seu damnari. 	@1 etiam$ 	@2 tribuitur homini$ 	@3 homini$ 	@4 i ita pro ejus spiritu, nam cum moritur homo, ille exsuscitatur$ </p>
