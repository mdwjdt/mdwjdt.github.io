<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1904节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1904.</strong>“亚伯兰的妻子撒莱才带来”表对真理的情感，就是真正意义上的“妻子撒莱”。这从“撒莱”和“妻子”的含义清楚可知，“撒莱”表示与良善联结的真理，“妻子”表示情感（参看<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>节）。有两种情感彼此截然不同，相互分离，即对良善的情感和对真理的情感。人在重生时，对真理的情感起主导作用，因为对真理的情感为了良善的缘故而打动他。但是，一旦他重生，对良善的情感就会起主导作用，源于良善的对真理的情感会打动他。对良善的情感属于意愿，对真理的情感属于理解力。上古之人可以说在这两种情感之间建立婚姻，他们用良善（或对良善的爱）和真理（或对真理的爱）来指称人，称前者为“丈夫”，后者为“妻子”。善和真与婚姻的这种对比来源于天上的婚姻。<br />就本身而言，善与真没有任何生命可言，但它们通过爱或情感获得自己的生命。它们仅仅是生命的工具。所以，产生对善与真的情感的爱如何，生命就如何，因为整个生命构成整个爱或情感。正因如此，“妻子撒莱”的真正意义表示对真理的情感。由于智慧（the intellectual）渴望理性，如同渴望自己的后代，还由于她所说的话表达了这种渴望或情感，故本节经文明确说“亚伯兰的妻子撒莱将她给了自己的丈夫亚伯兰”。这句话在内义上若不包含这类事物，就没有必要重复，因为它本身是多余的。<br />智性真理有别于理性真理，理性真理则有别于记忆知识形式的真理，就象内在物，居间物和外在物。智性真理是内在的，理性真理是居间的，而记忆知识的真理是外在的。这些真理区别极其显着，因为一个比一个更内在。对每个人而言，内在的，或存在于其至内在部分的智性真理并不是他自己的，而是与他同在的主的。主由此流入理性，真理在此首先看似人自己的，然后通过理性流入记忆知识。由此明显可知，人不可能貌似自主通过智性真理思考，只能通过理性真理和记忆知识的真理思考，因为这些真理看似是他的。<br />当主活在世上时，唯独祂通过智性真理思考。因为这真理就是其与良善联结的神性真理，或与神性属天之物联结的神性属灵之物。主在这方面不同于其他所有人。通过神性如同通过自己那样思考对人来说是永远不可能的，这种能力也不可能存在于人里面，只存在于从耶和华成孕的主里面。由于主通过智性真理，即通过对智性真理的爱或情感思考，所以祂也因这真理而渴望理性。这就是为何此处经上说，表示对智性真理情感的“亚伯兰的妻子撒莱”“带来埃及人夏甲，将她给了自己的丈夫亚伯兰为妾”。<br />此处所隐藏的其它奥秘无法被理性揭示并解读出来，因为对于自己的内在事物，人处于巨大的模糊中，事实上，对它们根本没有任何概念。他将理性和智慧都置于记忆知识，殊不知，这些彼此有别，相互分离，其区别甚至显着到智慧离了理性也能存在，源于智慧的理性离了记忆知识亦能存在的程度。对那些沉浸于记忆知识的人来说，这一点定然看似一个悖论，但却是真理。然而，任何人都不可能处在记忆知识形式的真理中，即拥有对它的情感和信念，除非真理存在于理性中，主通过智慧流入并经过理性。这些奥秘只有在来世才能向人敞开。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1904</b></p><p><b>1904.</b>
Sarai, Abram's wife, took. That this signifies the affection of truth, which in the genuine sense is "Sarai the wife," is evident from the signification of "Sarai," as being truth adjoined to good, and 
from the signification of a "wife," as being affection (explained above, n. 915, 1468). There are two affections distinct from each other,-affection of good, and affection of truth. When a man is being 
regenerated the affection of truth has the lead, for he is affected with truth for the sake of good; but when he has been regenerated the affection of good has the lead, and from good he is affected 
with truth. The affection of good is of the will; the affection of truth is of the understanding. Between these two affections the most ancient people instituted as it were a marriage. Good, or the 
love of good, they called man as a husband; truth, or the love of truth, they called man as a wife. The comparison of good and truth with marriage has its origin in the heavenly marriage.  [2] Regarded 
in themselves, good and truth have no life, but they derive their life from love or affection. They are only instrumentalities of life; and such as is the love that affects the good and truth, such 
is the life; for the whole of life is of love, or affection. Hence it is that "Sarai the wife," in the genuine sense, signifies the affection of truth. And because in the case before us the intellectual 
desired the rational as an offspring, and because that which she speaks is of this desire or affection, it is therefore expressly said in this verse, "Sarai, Abram's wife, gave to Abram, her man," 
which there would have been no need of repeating if it did not involve such things in the internal sense, for in themselves these words would be superfluous.  [3] Intellectual truth is distinguished 
from rational truth, and this from truth in the form of memory-knowledge, as are what is internal, what is intermediate, and what is external. Intellectual truth is internal, rational truth is intermediate, 
truth of memory-knowledge is external. These are most distinct from each other, because one is more internal than another. With any man whatever, intellectual truth, which is internal, or in 
his inmost, is not the man's, but is the Lord's with the man. From this the Lord flows into the rational, where truth first appears as belonging to man; and through the rational into the memory-knowledge; 
from which it is evident that man cannot possibly think as of himself from intellectual truth, but only from rational truth and truth of memory-knowledge, because these appear as if they were his. 
 [4] The Lord alone, when He lived in the world, thought from intellectual truth, for this was His Divine truth in conjunction with Good, or the Divine spiritual in conjunction with the Divine celestial, 
and herein was the Lord distinguished from every other man. To think from what is Divine as from himself is never possible to man, nor in man, but only in Him who was conceived of Jehovah. Because 
He thought from intellectual truth, that is, from the love or affection of intellectual truth, from it also He desired the rational, and this is why it is here said that "Sarai, Abram's wife" (by 
whom is meant the affection of intellectual truth) "took Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her to Abram her husband, for a woman to him."  [5] The rest of the arcana that are herein cannot be unfolded and 
explained to the apprehension, because man is in the greatest obscurity, and in fact has no idea at all of the internal things within him, for he makes both the rational and the intellectual to consist 
in memory-knowledge, and is not aware that these are distinct from each other, so distinct indeed that the intellectual can exist apart from the rational, and also the rational that is derived from 
the intellectual, apart from the memory-knowledge. This cannot but seem a paradox to those who are in memory-knowledges, but still it is the truth. It is however impossible for anyone to be in the truth 
that is in the form of memory-knowledge (that is, in the affection of this and the belief in it), unless he is in rational truth, into which and through which the Lord inflows from the intellectual. 
These arcana do not open to man except in the other life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1904</b></p><p><b>1904.</b>
That 'Sarai, Abram's wife, took' means the affection for truth, which in the genuine sense is 'Sarai the wife', is clear from the meaning of 'Sarai' as truth allied to good, and from the meaning of 'wife' 
as affection, dealt with already in <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>. There are; two affections, distinct and separate - the affection for good and the affection for truth. While a person is being regenerated the affection 
for truth takes the lead, for it is an affection for truth for the sake of good that moves him; but once he has been regenerated the affection for good takes the lead, and it is now an affection 
for truth originating in good that moves him. The affection for good belongs to the will, the affection for truth to the understanding. The most ancient people established a marriage so to speak between 
these two affections. They used to refer to good (or the love of good) and truth (or the love of truth) as Man, calling the former 'the husband' and the latter 'the wife'. The comparison of good and 
truth to a marriage has its origins in the heavenly marriage. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Regarded in themselves good and truth do not possess any life, but they derive their life from love or affection. They are merely 
the instruments that serve life. Consequently as is the love producing the affection for good and truth, so is the life; for the whole of life constitutes the whole of love or affection. This is why 
'Sarai his wife' in the genuine sense means the affection for truth. And because the Intellectual desired the Rational as its offspring, and because what she says is an expression of that desire or affection, 
this verse contains the explicit wording, 'Sarai, Abram's wife, gave to Abram her husband' which would be an unnecessary repetition - for in themselves these words would be quite superfluous 
- if such matters were not embodied within the internal sense.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Intellectual truth is distinct and separate from rational truth, and rational truth from factual truth, just as what is internal, 
what is intermediate, and what is external are. Intellectual truth is internal, rational truth is intermediate, while factual truth is external. These are quite distinct and separate because one is 
interior to another. With everyone intellectual truth, which is internal, or that present within the inmost part of him, is not his own but is the Lord's with him. From this the Lord flows into the rational, 
where truth first appears as if it were the person's own, and through the rational into his faculty of knowing. From these considerations it is clear that nobody can possibly think as of himself 
from intellectual truth, but from rational truth and factual truth because these do appear as if they were his. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Only the Lord, when He lived in the world, thought from intellectual truth, for 
that truth was His own Divine truth joined to good, or the Divine spiritual joined to the Divine celestial. In this respect the Lord was different from all others. Man in no way possesses the ability 
to think from the Divine existing within himself as his essential self, nor can that ability possibly exist within man, only within Him who was conceived from Jehovah. Because He thought from intellectual 
truth, that is, from the love or affection for intellectual truth, from that truth also He desired the Rational. This is why it is stated here that 'Sarai, Abram's wife', by whom is meant the affection 
for intellectual truth, 'took Hagar the Egyptian and gave her to Abram her husband as his wife (mulier)'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 No other arcana concealed here can be brought out and explained intelligibly because 
the human being dwells in very great obscurity regarding his own internals. Indeed he has no conception of these, for he identifies the rational and the intellectual degrees of the mind with the 
factual degree, not knowing that these degrees are distinct and separate, so distinct in fact that the intellectual is able to exist without the rational, as also can the rational, while subordinate 
to the intellectual, exist without the factual. This must inevitably seem absurd to those wholly immersed in factual knowledge, but it is nevertheless the truth. It is not possible however for anyone 
to have truth present in the factual degree of his mind, that is to say, to have an affection for it and a belief in it, if truth is not present in the rational, into which and through which the Lord 
flows in from the intellectual degree. These arcana do not lie open to man's view except in the next life. </p>

`Accepit Sarai uxor Abrami': quod significet affectionem veri quae in genuino sensu [est] `Sarai uxor,' constat a significatione `Sarai' quod sit verum adjunctum bono, et ex significatione `uxoris' 
quod sit affectio, (o)de qua prius n. 915, 1468.  Sunt binae affectiones inter se distinctae, affectio boni et affectio veri; cum {1} regeneratur homo,' tunc affectio veri praecedit, nam afficitur vero 
propter bonum; cum autem regeneratus est, praecedit affectio boni et ex bono afficitur vero; affectio boni est voluntatis, affectio veri est intellectus; antiquissimi inter binas affectiones {2} instituerunt 
quasi conjugium, bonum seu amorem boni appellarunt hominem ut maritum, verum seu amorem veri appellarunt hominem ut uxorem; comparatio boni et veri cum conjugio ducit originem a conjugio caelesti. 
 [2] Bonum et verum in se spectata nullius vitae sunt, sed ab amore seu ab affectione trahunt vitam; sunt modo instrumentalia vitae, quare qualis amor afficiens bonum et verum, talis est vita, 
nam omne vitae est amoris seu affectionis; inde est quod `Sarai uxor' in genuino sensu significet affectionem veri, et hic quia Intellectuale desiderabat Rationale ut prolem, et qui desiderii seu affectionis 
est quae loquitur, ideo in hoc versu express dicitur, `Sarai uxor Abrami dedit Abramo viro,' quae non opus fuisset {3} iterum dicere, in se enim superflua forent nisi talia in sensu interno involverent. 
[3] Verum intellectuale distinguitur a vero rationali, et hoc vero scientifico, sicut internum, medium et externum; verum intellectuale est internum, verum rationale est medium, verum scientificum 
est externum; haec inter se distinctissima sunt quia unum es altero interius; apud hominem quemcumque verum intellectuale quod est internum seu apud intimum ejus, non est hominis sed est Domini 
apud hominem; inde Dominus influit in rationale ubi primum verum apparet sicut hominis, et per rationale in scientificum; ex quibus constat quod homo nusquam cogitare possit sicut a se ex vero intellectuali 
sed ex vero rationali et scientifico, quia haec apparent sicut ejus; [4] Solus Dominus ex vero intellectuali, cum vixit in mundo cogitavit, quia illud erat Divinum Ipsius conjunctum bono, seu 
Divinum spirituale conjunctum {4} Divino caelesti; in hoc distinctus fuit Dominus ab omni alio homine; ex Divino cogitare ut a se Ipso, nusquam est hominis nec dabile in homine, solum in Illo qui conceptus 
fuit a Jehovah; quia ex vero intellectuali, hoc est, ex amore seu affectione veri intellectualis cogitavit, etiam ex illo desideravit Rationale, inde est quod hic dicatur quod `Sarai uxor Abrami,' 
per quam intelligitur affectio veri intellectualis, `acceperit Hagarem Aegyptiam, et dederit eam Abramo viro suo, illi in `mulierem {5}': [5] reliqua arcana quae hic sunt; ad captum evolvi et explicari 
nequeunt quia homo in obscurissimo est, immo in nulla idea, de internis suis; in scientifico enim ponit et rationale et intellectuale, nec novit quod distincta sint, et quidem ita distincta ut intellectuale 
dari queat absque rationali, ut et inde rationale absque scientifico, quod ut paradoxon non potest non videri illis qui in scientificis sunt, sed usque est veritas; non autem dari potest 
quod aliquis in vero scientifico sit, nempe in ejus affectione et fide, nisi sit in vero rationali, in quod et per quod influat Dominus ab intellectuali; haec arcana homini non patent nisi in altera vita. 	@1
