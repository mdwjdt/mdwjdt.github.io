<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5042节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5042.</strong>“向他施怜悯”表神性之爱在每一件事里面。这从“怜悯”的含义清楚可知，“怜悯”在至高意义上是指神性之爱（参看<a href="1735.htm">1735</a>，<a href="3063.htm">3063</a>，<a href="3073.htm">3073</a>，<a href="3120.htm">3120</a>，<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>节）。至高意义上所理解的神性本身是爱，完全超出人的理解。一切事物从这爱经由真理而存在并持续存在，无论有生命的，还是无生命的。源于本质存在的这神性之爱通过主里面的生命至内层流入祂凭从母亲那里取的这个人身所行的每一件事里面，并将祂的注意力转向通往最终目的的具体目的；这最终目的就是人类可以得救。由于主凭祂里面的神性本身能看到其人身的性质，即：它由于遗传而充满邪恶，故经上说“耶和华向他施怜悯”，以此在至高意义上表示神性之爱在每一件事里面。因为神性怜悯无非是对那些沉浸在痛苦中的人（<a href="1049.htm">1049</a>，<a href="3063.htm">3063</a>，<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>节），也就是对那些经历试探之人的神性之爱。事实上，经历试探的人会陷入痛苦；在圣言中，“困苦的”主要是指这些人。</p>

And inclined mercy unto him. That this signifies the Divine love in everything, is evident from the signification of "mercy," as being in the supreme sense the Divine love (see n. 1735, 3063, 3073, 3120, 
3875). The Divine being itself, understood in the supreme sense, is love utterly incomprehensible to man; and from this love through truth all things come forth and subsist, both those which have 
life and those which have not. This Divine love from the very being through the inmost of life in the Lord, flowed into everything He did from the human taken from the mother, and directed all to ends, 
and these ends to the ultimate end that mankind might be saved. And because the Lord, from the Divine Itself in Him, saw the nature of His human, that it was hereditarily in evil, therefore it is said 
that "Jehovah inclined mercy unto him;" and by this in the supreme sense is meant the Divine love in everything. For the Divine mercy is nothing else than the Divine love toward those who are immersed 
in miseries (n. 1049, 3063, 3875), that is, toward those who are in temptations; for these are in miseries, and are chiefly meant in the Word by the "miserable." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5042</b></p><p><b>5042.</b>
'And showed mercy to him' means Divine love within every individual thing. This is clear from the meaning of 'mercy' in the highest sense as Divine Love, dealt with in <a href="1735.htm">1735</a>, <a href="3063.htm">3063</a>, <a href="3073.htm">3073</a>, <a href="3120.htm">3120</a>, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>. The 
Divine Being (Esse) itself is that Love which is meant in the highest sense and is completely beyond human comprehension. Acting by means of truth, that love brings all things into being and keeps 
them in being, both those which are animate and those which are inanimate. This Divine Love that emanated from that Essential Being (Esse) was flowing through the inmost centre of life within the Lord 
into every individual thing He did from the human which He had taken to Himself from His mother; it directed His attention towards particular ends, leading on to the final one, which was that the human 
race might be saved. And because the Lord could see, from the Divine itself present within Him, the essential nature of His human - that owing to its heredity it was steeped in evil - the words 'Jehovah 
showed mercy to him' are used, meaning in the highest sense the presence of Divine Love within every single thing. Divine mercy (misericordia) is nothing else than Divine Love directed towards those 
trapped in misery (miseriae), <a href="1099.htm">1099</a>, <a href="3063.htm">3063</a>, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, that is, towards those undergoing temptations. For people who undergo temptations dwell in misery, and these primarily are meant in the Word by 'the 
wretched' (miseri). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5042</b>
</p><b>5042.</b>
`Et inclinavit ad eum misericordiam': quod significet amorem Divinum in singulis, constat ex significatione `misericordiae' quod in supremo sensu sit `Divinus Amor', de qua n. 1735, 3063, 3073, 3120, 
3875; Ipsum Divinum Esse est Amor in supremo sensu intellectus, homini prorsus incomprehensibilis; ex illo per verum existunt et subsistunt omnia tam qua vitam habent quam quae vitam non habent. 
 Divinus ille Amor ab Ipso Esse per intimum vitae in Domino influebat in singula quae ex humano a matre suscepto egit, et direxit ad fines, et hos ad ultimum ut salvaretur genus humanum; et quia 
Dominus ex Ipso Divino in Se vidit humanum suum quale esset, quod nempe ex hereditario in malo, ideo dicitur quod `Jehovah inclinavit ad illum misericordiam', et per illa in sensu supremo intelligitur 
(t)Divinus Amor in singulis; Divina enim Misericordia non aliud est quam Divinus Amor erga illos qui in miseriis constituti sunt, n. 1049, 3063, 3875, hoc est, erga illos qui in tentationibus, 
hi enim in miseriis sunt, et per `miseros' in Verbo principaliter intelliguntur. </p>
