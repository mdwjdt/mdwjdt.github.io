<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>932.</strong>无需通过圣言证实“播种与收割”表要重生之人，因而表教会。人常常被比作和比喻为一块田，因而被比作和比喻为播种或播种期，而主的圣言则被被比作和比喻为“种子”，果效被比作和比喻为出产或收割，谁都能通过熟悉的语言形式理解这一切。一般来说，这里论及每个人，对他来说，永远不会缺乏来自主并播种在他心里的种子，无论他在不在教会中，即无论他认不认识主的圣言。若主不播下种子，人根本行不出一丝善事。<br />一切仁之善，即便是外邦人当中的，都是从主那里获得的种子。尽管对外邦人来说，这善并非是如教会中那样的信之善，但它仍能发展为信之善。事实上，在来生，那些过着如在世时所习惯的那种仁慈生活的外邦人，在被天使指教后，都会信奉和接受正信的教义和仁之信，比基督徒容易得多。对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。然而，此处尤其论及要重生的人，也就是说，不会再有诸如教会未能出现在世上某个地方这样的事了。这就是此处“尽地所有的日子，播种与收割”的含义。播种与收割，即教会总会出现在世上某个地方，这一点与前一节内容相关，即人不再象上古教会的最后一代那样毁灭自己了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]932.</strong> The symbolism of sowing and reaping as the regenerating person, and so the church, needs no confirmation from the Word because it occurs so many times. Not only is a field — and consequently the sowing of it — used as a metaphor and simile for a person, but seed is used in the same way for the Lord's Word, and the produce or harvest, for the effect it has. Everyone understands this meaning because its appearance in the Word has made it common in everyday speech.<br />The general subject here is humankind as a whole and the fact that the time will never come when there are no seeds being planted in us by the Lord, whether we are inside or outside the church, that is, whether we know the Lord's Word or not. Without seed planted by the Lord, no one can do a whit of good.<br />[2] Even among non-Christians, every charitable kindness is seed from the Lord. The good that non-Christians do is not a result of the true faith, as it can be among people inside the church, but it can become so. Non-Christians usually live a life of charity in the world, and when those who do so are instructed by angels in the other life, they embrace and welcome the teachings of true faith and the faith that comes of charity much more easily than Christians. More about this later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_932/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1032" target=_top>1032-1033</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_932/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2589" target=_top>2589-2605</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_932/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2861" target=_top>2861:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_932/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3263#subsection-2-2" target=_top>3263:2</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.<br />The specific subject here is the regenerating individual and the fact that the church will never cease to exist in at least one place on earth. That is what "throughout all the days of the earth there will be sowing and reaping" means.<br />The fact that there will always be sowing and reaping, or that the church will always exist, connects with the message of the last verse: that people could no longer destroy themselves in the way the final generation of the earliest church had done. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 932</b></p><p><b>932.</b>
That "seed-time and harvest" signify man who is to be regenerated, and thus the church, there is no need to confirm from the Word, because it occurs so often that man is compared and likened to a field, 
and thus to a sowing or seed-time, and the Word of the Lord to seed, and the effect to the produce or harvest, as everyone comprehends from the forms of speech thus made familiar. In general every 
man is here treated of-that there never will be lacking to him the sowing of seed from the Lord, whether he be within the church or without; that is, whether he be acquainted with the Word of the Lord, 
or be not acquainted with it. Without seed sown by the Lord, man can do nothing of good. All the good of charity, even with the Gentiles, is seed from the Lord; and although with these there is not 
the good of faith, as there may be within the church, yet there may come the good of faith; for in the other life those Gentiles who have lived in charity, as Gentiles are wont to do in this world, when 
instructed by angels, embrace and receive the doctrine of true faith and the faith of charity much more easily than do Christians; concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. Specifically, 
however, the subject treated of here is the man who is to be regenerated, that is to say that there will be no such thing as a failure of the church to come forth somewhere on the earth, which is 
here signified by there being seed-time and harvest all the days of the earth. That seed-time and harvest, or the church, will always come into existence, has regard to what was said in the preceding 
verse, namely, that man will no more be able so to destroy himself as was done by the last posterity of the Most Ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 932</b></p><p><b>932.</b>
There is no need to confirm from the Word that 'seedtime and harvest' means the person who is to be regenerated, and consequently the Church, because the comparison and likening of the individual to 
a field and so to 'seedtime' and of the Lord's Word to 'seed', and of what it accomplishes to 'produce' or 'harvest', occurs so frequently. This anybody can also gather from these same expressions which 
are part of his everyday vocabulary. In general the reference is to all men, and the fact that not one ever fails to have seed from the Lord sown within him, no matter whether he is inside the Church 
or outside of it, that is, whether he knows the Lord's Word or whether he does not. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Without this implanting of seed from the Lord nobody can do the least good thing. Every good that stems from 
charity, even among gentiles, is seed obtained from the Lord. Although with gentiles it is not the good of faith as it may be inside the Church, it can nevertheless develop into the good of faith. 
In fact gentiles who have led charitable lives, as they are accustomed to do in the world, on being instructed by angels in the next life embrace and accept teaching about true faith and embrace and accept 
faith that accompanies charity, far more easily than Christians. These matters will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. In particular however the subject here is the person who is 
to be regenerated, that is to say, the Church will not fail to emerge somewhere on earth. This is the meaning here of 'during all the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest'. The statement that seedtime 
and harvest, which are the Church, will always be emergent somewhere on earth has regard to the content of the previous verse, that is to say, man will no longer be able to destroy himself in the 
way that the final descendants of the Most Ancient Church did. </p>

</p><b>932.</b>
Quod 'sementis et messis' significent hominem regenerandum et inde Ecclesiam, non opus est confirmare ex Verbo, qui toties occurrit tam quod homo comparetur et assimiletur agro, ita 'sementi,' quam quod 
Verbum Domini 'semini,' et ipse effectus 'proventui aut messi'; quod quisque ex familiari inde facto sermone etiam comprehendit.  In genere hic agitur de omni homine, quod nusquam desiturum, quin 
ei inseminaretur semen a Domino, sive si intra Ecclesiam sive extra Ecclesiam, hoc est, sive noverit Verbum Domini sive non noverit; absque inseminato semine a Domino, homo ne hilum boni potest facere; 
omne bonum charitatis, etiam apud gentes, est semen a Domino, apud quas tametsi non est bonum fide sicut potest esse intra Ecclesiam, usque bonum fidei potest fieri gentes enim qui in charitate vixerunt 
sicut solent in mundo, etiam in altera vita, cum ab angelis instruuntur, facilius multo quam Christiani verae fidei doctrinam et fidem charitatis amplectuntur et accipiunt de quibus, ex Divina Domini 
Misericordia, in sequentibus.  In specie autem hic agitur de homine regenerando, quod nempe non desiturum, quin Ecclesia alicubi in terra existat; quod hic significatur per quod 'omnibus diebus terrae 
sementis et messis.' Quod semper sementis et messis, seu Ecclesia, exstitura sit, spectat illa quae in versu praecedente, nempe quod homo non amplius se ita perdere poterit sicut posteritas ultima 
Antiquissimae Ecclesiae. </p>
