<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1726节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1726.</strong>“撒冷王”表内层事物或理性事物的平安状态。这从“撒冷”的含义清楚可知。“撒冷”的原义表“平安”，也表“直觉”，因而表平安的状态和直觉的状态。平安的状态是主国度的状态，在这种状态下，主的属天和属灵之物如同处于它们的早晨和春天。因为平安就像破晓的黎明和春天的新生命。那时，黎明和春天会使那时触及感官的一切事物充满欢喜快乐，每个物体都从黎明和春天的普遍情感中汲取一种情感。主国度的平安状态也是如此：在平安状态下，一切属天和属灵之物仿佛处于它们的早晨或春花烂漫和迷人的微笑中，即处于它们的幸福本身中。平安的状态就是如此感染一切事物，因为主是平安本身。这也是诗篇中撒冷的含义：<br />在犹大，神为人所认识；在以色列，祂的名为大。在撒冷，有祂的帐幕，在锡安，有祂的居所。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.1.htm">76:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.2.htm">2</a>）<br />当人经历试探的争战时，主会轮番赐予他平安的状态，从而使他精神焕发。“撒冷”在此表平安的状态，接下来提到的“饼和酒”表属天和属灵之物，因而表平安中的属天和属灵之物的状态，这状态就是精神焕发本身。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1726.</strong> The symbolism of king of Salem as the peaceful state of his intermediate plane, or his rational mind, can be seen from the symbolism of Salem. In the original language, Salem means peace and also wholeness, so it symbolizes a state of peace and a state of completion.{*1} A state of peace is the state of the Lord's kingdom. In that state the Lord's heavenly and spiritual blessings seem to be in their dawn and their springtime. Peace resembles dawn at the break of day and spring in the greening of the year. The dawn and the spring cause the senses and everything that touches them to be filled with joy and gladness. Each sensation draws its effect from the overall effect of the daybreak and the blooming of the year. It is the same with the peaceful state of the Lord's kingdom. In that state, every heavenly and every spiritual feature enjoys the flowering laughter of its springtime dawn — that is, its most genuine happiness. A state of peace affects every feature this way because the Lord is peace itself. That is what David meant by Salem:<br />God is known in Judah; in Israel his name is great, and in Salem is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place is in Zion. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1726/bible_king-james-version_psalms_76_1-2" target=_top>Psalms 76:1-2</a>)<br />While we are fighting our spiritual battles, the Lord from time to time grants us a time of peace and in this way revives us. A time of peace is symbolized here by Salem and soon after by the bread and wine as well, which symbolize heavenly and spiritual qualities, and so the condition of those qualities at peace. This condition is renewal itself.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In Hebrew, the word Salem, or Shalem (שָׁלֵם [šālēm]), is a poetic or archaic name for Jerusalem. It may, however, be etymologically connected with shalom (שָׁלוֹם [šālôm]), a word meaning wholeness, soundness, and peace. [RS, LHC] </p>

King of Salem. That this signifies a state of peace as to interior or rational things, is evident from the signification of "Salem." In the original language "Salem" means "peace," and also "perfection;" 
thus it signifies a state of peace, and a state of perfection. A state of peace is the state of the Lord's kingdom; in that state the Lord's celestial and spiritual things are as in their morning, 
and in their spring; for peace is like the dawn in the early morning, and like the spring in the springtime. The dawn and the spring cause all things that then meet the senses to be full of joy and 
gladness; every object draws an affection from the general one of the dawn and of the springtime. So is it with the state of peace in the Lord's kingdom: in the state of peace all celestial and spiritual 
things are as it were in their morning or springtide flower and smile, that is, in their happiness itself. So does the state of peace affect everything, for the Lord is peace itself. This is signified 
by Salem also in David: </p>
<p>     In Judah is God known, His name is great in Israel, in Salem also is His tabernacle, and His dwelling place in Zion (Ps. 76:1, 2). When a man is in the combats of temptations, 
he is by turns gifted by the Lord with a state of peace, and is thus refreshed. A state of peace is here signified by "Salem;" and presently also by the "bread and wine," by which celestial 
and spiritual things are signified; thus a state of celestial and spiritual things in peace, which state is refreshment itself. </p>

That 'king of Salem' means a state of peace as regards interior or rational things is clear from the meaning of 'Salem'. Salem in the original language means peace, and also perfection, and thus [in 
the internal sense] means a state of peace and a state of perfection. A state of peace is the state of the Lord's kingdom. In that state celestial and spiritual things, which are the Lord's, exist so 
to speak in their early morning and their spring-time, for that peace is like the dawn that breaks in the early morning, and the new life that comes in spring-time. The dawn and the spring cause everything 
that reaches the senses at those times to be full of joy and gladness; every object draws forth a particular affection from one's general affection for the dawn and the spring. So it is with the 
state of peace in the Lord's kingdom. In a state of peace everything celestial or spiritual exists so to speak in its early morn or spring-time blossom and cheer, that is, in its very happiness. Such 
is the manner in which the state of peace affects each particular thing, for the Lord is Peace itself. The same is also meant by 'Salem' in David, </p>
<blockquote>
In Judah is God known; in Israel His name is great, 
and in Salem is His tabernacle, and His dwelling- place in Zion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2076:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 76:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>While a person is undergoing the conflicts brought about by temptations the Lord grants him by turns a state of peace, 
and so refreshes him. A state of peace is meant here by 'Salem' and also by 'the bread and wine' mentioned next, which means celestial and spiritual things and thus a state of celestial and spiritual 
things in peace, which state is refreshment itself. </p>

'Rex Shalem': quod significet statum pacis quoad interiora seu rationalia, constat a significatione 'Shalem'; Shalem in lingua originali significat 'pacem,' ut et 'perfectionem,' ita statum pacis et 
statum perfectionis: status pacis est status regni Domini; in illo statu sunt caelestia et spiritualia Domini, sicut in sua aurora et suo vere, nam se habet pax sicut matutino tempore aurora, et verno 
tempore ver; aurora et ver faciunt ut omnia quae tunc sensus contingunt, sint gaudii et laetitiae plena, trahunt singula affectionem a communi aurorae et veris; ita se habet cum statu pacis in regno 
Domini; in statu pacis omnia caelestia et spiritualia in suo quasi aurorae aut verno flore et risu sunt, hoc est, in ipsa sua felicitate; status pacis afficit ita singula, nam Dominus est Ipsa Pax; quod 
etiam per Shalem apud Davidem intelligitur, Notus in Jehuda Deus, in Israele magnum nomen Ipsius, et est in Shalem tabernaculum Ipsius, et habitaculum Ipsius in Zione, Ps. lxxvi 2, 3 [A.V. 1, 2]. Cum 
homo in pugnis tentationum est, a Domino donatur per vices statu pacis, et sic recreatur; status pacis hic significatur per 'Shalem,' et mox quoque per 'panem et vinum,' per quae significantur caelestia 
et spiritualia, ita status caelestium et spiritualium in pace, qui status est ipsa recreatio. </p>
