<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2632节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2632.</strong>“亚伯拉罕给他的儿子以撒行了割礼”表理性的洁净。这从“行割礼”的含义和“以撒”的代表物清楚可知：“行割礼”是指洁净（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）；“以撒”是指神圣理性（参看<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节）。<br />主的第一理性出生的方式和其他人的一样，也就是说，是通过知识和认知出生的，这在前面论述以实玛利的地方已说明，以实玛利就代表主的第一理性。由于该理性和其他人的一样，都是通过知识和认知，因而通过外在途径，就是感官途径出生的，故它里面不可避免地含有很多来自外在世界的东西，因为理性观念就是通过它们获得的。对主来说，由于祂从母亲所得来的遗传之物，情况尤其如此。主从祂的理性中逐渐剔除的，正是这些世俗之物和这种遗传物，直到这理性能接受神性为止（<a href="2624.htm">2624</a>，<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>节）。主的神圣理性就是在这个时候出生的，由“以撒”来代表（<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节），但不是象祂的第一理性那样通过外在途径，就是感官途径出生，而是通过内在途径从神性本身出生（<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>，<a href="2629.htm">2629</a>节）。这一过程不是立刻，而是逐渐实现的（<a href="1690.htm">1690</a>，<a href="2033.htm">2033</a>节），所以这理性被洁净，并不断得以洁净。“亚伯拉罕给他的儿子，就是满八天的儿子行了割礼”就表示这种洁净。主逐渐使祂的理性变成神性，并不断洁净它，这一点也清楚可见于约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，父啊，荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来：我已经荣耀了，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>）<br />“荣耀”就是变成神性（参看<a href="1603.htm">1603</a>，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>节）。<br />在古教会，割礼只代表和表示人当从我欲和物欲中洁净，并非别的什么，这种洁净是逐渐并持续进行的（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>末尾，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2056.htm">2056</a>节）；尤其在人已新生或重生之时。因为那时，主正通过内在途径，即经由形成良知的良善而流入进来，逐渐并不断将由于遗传之恶和实际罪恶而粘附于人的事物分离出去。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2632</b></p><p><b>2632.</b>
Abraham circumcised Isaac his son. That this signifies the purification of the rational, is evident from the signification of "being circumcised," which is to be purified (see n. 2039); and from the 
representation of "Isaac," as being the Divine rational (see n. 2630). [2] That the Lord's first rational was born as with others, namely, by means of knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones], has been 
stated before, where Ishmael was treated of, by whom that rational is represented. As this was born by means of knowledges, thus by the external way, which is that of the senses, and as with others, 
it could not but have in itself many things from the outward world, for from them are the ideas of the rational procured; and this the more because it had its hereditary from the mother. It was these 
worldly things and this hereditary which the Lord successively expelled from His rational, and this until it was such as to be able to receive the Divine (n. 2624, 2625). The Lord's Divine rational was 
then born, which is represented by Isaac (n. 2630); not however by the external way, which is that of the senses, as the former rational was; but by the internal way from the Divine Itself (n. 2628, 
2629). As this was not done at once, but successively (n. 1690, 2033), it was purified, and this continually; which is signified by "Abraham's circumcising his son, a son of eight days." That the Lord 
made His rational Divine by successive steps, and continually purified it, is evident also in John: </p>
<p>Jesus said, Father, glorify Thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven: I have both glorified, 
and will glorify again (John 12:28). That to "glorify" is to make Divine, may be seen above (n. 1603, 1999). [3] In the Ancient Church nothing else was represented and signified by circumcision than 
that a man should be purified from the loves of self and of the world, and this also by successive steps and continually (see n. 2039, 2046 at the end, 2049, 2056); especially when he has been born 
a new man, that is, when he has been regenerated; for the Lord then flows in by the internal way, that is, by the good of conscience, and successively and continually separates the things which adhere 
both from hereditary and from actual evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2632</b></p><p><b>2632.</b>
'Abraham circumcised his son Isaac' means purification of the rational. This is clear from the meaning of 'being circumcised' as being purified, dealt with in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, and from the representation of 'Isaac' 
as the Divine Rational, dealt with in <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord's first rational was born in the way it is with others, that is to say, by means of facts and cognitions. This has been stated already 
where Ishmael, who represents that rational, is the subject. Because it was born, as with others, by means of facts and cognitions, thus by the external way, which is that of the senses, this rational 
inevitably included many things that were worldly in origin, for it is from those things that the ideas which the rational possesses are acquired. This was even more so the case with the Lord on account 
of the heredity He had from the mother. It was those worldly things and this heredity which the Lord gradually cast out of His rational until it was such that it was able to receive the Divine, <a href="2624.htm">2624</a>, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>. At this point the Lord's Divine Rational, represented by 'Isaac', was born, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>, not indeed by the external way, which is that of the senses - as was the case with the previous rational - but 
by the internal way from the Divine itself, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>, <a href="2629.htm">2629</a>. As this was not accomplished all at once but gradually, <a href="1690.htm">1690</a>, <a href="2033.htm">2033</a>, the rational was purified, and constantly so. It is this purification that 
is meant by 'Abraham circumcised his son, a son eight days old'. That the Lord gradually made His Rational Divine and purified it constantly is clear also in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Father, glorify Your 
name. A voice therefore came from heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:-28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Glorifying' is making Divine, see <a href="1603.htm">1603</a>, <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the Ancient Church nothing else 
was represented and meant by circumcision than that a person should be purified from self-love and love of the world, which is also effected gradually and constantly, see <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2046.htm">2046</a> (end), <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2056.htm">2056</a>, 
especially when a person has been born anew or regenerated. For at that time the Lord is flowing in by the internal way, that is, through the good that forms part of conscience; and He gradually and 
constantly separates the things which cling to that person both as a result of hereditary evil and of the evil of his own doing. </p>

`Circumcidit Abraham Jishakum filium suum': quod significet purificationem rationalis, constat (c)a significatione `circumcidi' quod sit purificari, de qua n. 2039; et ex repraesentatione `Jishaki' 
quod sit Rationale Divinum, de qua n. 2630.  [2] Quod primum rationale Domini natum sit sicut apud alios, nempe per scientifica et cognitione prius dictum est ubi de `Ismaele,' per quem illud rationale 
repraesentatur; hoc, quia per scientifica et cognitiones natum fuit, ita per viam externam quae est sensualium, sicut apud alios, non potuit quin plura apud se habuerit ex mundanis, ideae enim rationalis 
inde comparantur, et hoc magis quia ei hereditarium a matre; illa munda: erant, et hoc hereditarium, quae Dominus successive a rationali Suo expulit, et hoc usque dum tale esset ut recipere posset 
Divinum, n. 2624, 2625; tunc natum est Divinum Rationale Domini, quod per `Isacum' repraesentatur, n. 2630, et quidem non per viam externa quae est sensualium, ut rationale prius, sed per viam internam 
ex Ipso Divino, n. 2628, 2629; hoc quia non una vice sed successive factum, n. 1690, 2033, purificatum est, et hoc continue, quod significatur per quod `circumcidit Abraham filium suum, filium octo 
dierum': quod Dominus Rationale Suum successive Divinum fecerit, et continue purificaverit, constat etiam apud Johannem, 	Jesus dixit, Pater glorifica nomen Tuum; exiit igitur vox e caelo, Et glorificavi, 
et rursus glorificabo, xii 28; </p>
<p>[3] quod `glorificare' sit `Divinum facere, videatur n. 1603, 1999.  Per circumcisionem in Ecclesia Antiqua, nec aliud repraesentatum (c)et significatum est quam 
ut purificaretur homo ab amoribus sui et mundi, et hoc quoque successive et continue, videatur n. 2039, 2046 ad fin., 2049, 2056, praecipue cum natus est novus seu cum regeneratus; tunc enim per viam 
internam, hoc est, per bonum conscientiae, influit Dominus, ac separat successive et continue illa quae ex hereditario et ex actuali malo adhaerent. </p>
