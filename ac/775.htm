<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>775.</strong>由于一切良善皆分为属和种，无论属灵、属世的良善，还是衍生的感官、肉体的良善，故经上说各从其类。属灵的良善和真理各自所拥有的属如此众多，以至于它们数不胜数，更不用说属下面的种了。在天堂，一切属天、属灵的良善与真理，在其属上如此截然不同，这些属在其种上也如此截然不同，以致它们当中哪怕最小的也是与众不同的，并且它们如此不可胜数，可以说细小的差别是无限的。由此可以看出，人类的智慧何等贫乏，几近于无，它几乎不知道还存在属灵的良善与真理这回事，更不用说了解它们的性质了。<br />属天与属灵的良善及其衍生的真理发出并降下属世的良善与真理。因为属世的良善若不源自属灵的良善，永远不会存在，而这属灵的良善则源自属天的良善，并且同样通过属天的良善而持续存在。倘若属灵的退离属世的，属世的什么都不是。万物的源头乃是这样：每一个事物皆出自主；属天的出自祂；属灵的通过属天的出自祂；属世的通过属灵的出自祂；肉体的和感官的则通过属世的出自祂。由于它们全都以这样的方式从主而出，所以它们也通过祂而持续存在。众所周知，持续存在就是不断存在。凡认为万物以其它方式产生和存在之人，就象那些崇拜自然，并由此推演万物源头的人那样，都被这些假设牢牢支配，以致游荡在森林中的野兽的幻觉可以说都比他们理智。很多自认为在智慧上胜过其他人的人就是这样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]775.</strong> As all things have their divisions into broad and specific categories, including different kinds of goodness on both the spiritual and earthly planes, and on the resulting sensory and bodily planes, the present verse says every kind for each type. There are so many general categories of spiritual goodness and likewise of spiritual truth that they could never be listed. Still less could the particular varieties composing each general category be listed.<br />In heaven, all heavenly and spiritual goodness and truth are so carefully distinguished into their genera, and the genera into their species, that only what is perfectly distinct exists there. The forms are so far beyond counting that the number of individual species can be called unlimited. This shows the poverty and near insignificance of human wisdom, which hardly even knows that spiritual goodness and truth exist, let alone what they are.<br />[2] Earthly goodness and truth emerge and descend from heavenly and spiritual kinds of goodness (and from the truth that springs out of the latter kinds of goodness). Nothing good or true exists on the earthly plane that does not rise out of spiritual goodness, which itself rises out of heavenly goodness. Earthly goodness and truth also depend on the higher levels in order to remain in existence. If the spiritual level withdrew, the earthly level would be nothing.<br />The facts about the origin of all things are these: Absolutely everything comes from the Lord. The heavenly plane is from him. The spiritual plane comes into existence from him by means of the heavenly plane, as does the earthly plane by means of the spiritual, and the bodily and sensory planes by means of the earthly. Because this is how things come into existence from the Lord, it is also how they remain in existence. As is well known, to continue in existence is constantly to come into existence.{*1} Those who view the rise and genesis of things in any other way — people who worship the material world,{*2} for instance, and trace the origin of everything to it — are in the grip of such deadly theories that the phantasms of wild animals in the forest can be described as much more sane. This applies to many individuals who seem to themselves to excel others in wisdom.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "to continue in existence is constantly to come into existence" is subsistentia est perpetua existentia — a common theological maxim (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3483" target=_top>3483</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5084#subsection-2-3" target=_top>5084:3</a>; see also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_380#subsection-2-8" target=_top>Marriage Love 380:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775/swedenborg_interaction-of-the-soul-and-body-vickers_4" target=_top>Soul-Body Interaction 4</a>).

This notion is referred to as commonplace in part 5 of Descartes's Discourse on Method (Descartes [1637] 1968, 64): "It is certain, and this is an opinion commonly held among theologians, that the action by which [God] conserves [the world] now is the same as that by which he created it." Elsewhere Descartes offers this explanation: "The present time has no causal dependence on the time immediately preceding it. Hence, in order to secure the continued existence of a thing, no less a cause is required than that needed to produce it at the first" (Descartes [1641] 1952, 131). Thomas Aquinas makes a similar statement about all "creatures," that is, created things: "The being of every creature depends on God, so that not for a moment could it subsist [have independent existence], but would fall into nothingness were it not kept in being by the operation of the Divine power" (Summa Theologiae 1:104:1; translation in Aquinas 1952). In support of his position, Aquinas in turn cites another church father, Gregory the Great, specifically his Moralia in Job (Ethical Disputations on Job) 16:37; he is probably thinking of Gregory's statement there that "all things subsist in him [God]... . No created thing avails in itself either to subsist or to move." This Scholastic theory of perpetual creation is also discussed by the Anglo-Irish philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753) in his work The Principles of Human Knowledge (Berkeley [1710] 1952) 46. [JSR, SS, RS]<br />{*2} On the meaning of the phrase "people who worship the material world," see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_775/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_206" target=_top>206</a>.

It is said of each "after its kind" because there are genera and species of all goods, both spiritual and natural, and also of the derivative sensuous and corporeal goods. So many genera are there of 
spiritual goods, and so many genera likewise of spiritual truths, that they cannot be numbered; still less can the species of the genera. In heaven all goods and truths, celestial and spiritual, are 
so distinct in their genera, and these in their species, that there is not the least of them which is not most distinct; and so innumerable are they, that the specific differences may be said to be unlimited. 
From this it may be seen how poor and almost nonexistent is human wisdom, which scarcely knows that there is such a thing as spiritual good or spiritual truth, much less what it is. From celestial 
and spiritual goods and their derivative truths, issue and descend natural goods and truths. For there is never any natural good and truth that does not spring from spiritual good, and this from 
celestial, and also subsist from the same. If the spiritual should withdraw from the natural, the natural would be nothing. The origin of all things [rerum] is in this wise: all things, both in general 
and in particular, are from the Lord; from Him is the celestial; from Him through the celestial comes forth the spiritual; through the spiritual the natural; through the natural the corporeal and the 
sensuous. And as they all come forth from the Lord in this way, so also do they subsist from Him, for, as is well known, subsistence is a perpetual coming into existence. They who have a different 
conception of the coming into existence and rise of things, like those who worship nature and deduce from her the origins of things, are in principles so deadly that the phantasies of the wild beasts 
of the forest may be called far more sane. Such are very many who appear to themselves to excel others in wisdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 775</b></p><p><b>775.</b>
Since there are genera and species to all things, that is to say, to spiritual goods as well as to natural goods, and also to derivative sensory and bodily goods, 'according to its kind'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is said of 
each one. The genera of spiritual goods are so many, and the genera of spiritual truths are in like manner so many, that they cannot possibly be counted up, still less the species making up the genera. 
In heaven all celestial and spiritual goods and truths are so divided into their own genera, and these in turn into their own species, that the least significant of them is distinct from all the rest. 
And they are so countless that specific differences may be called unending. These considerations show how impoverished, and almost non-existent, human wisdom is, in that it hardly knows of the existence 
of spiritual good and truth, let alone what these may be.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is from celestial and spiritual goods, and truths springing from these, that natural goods and truths come into being and pass 
down. For no natural good or truth ever exists which has not come into being from spiritual good, and this in turn from celestial good, and which is not kept in being from these same sources. If the 
spiritual were to withdraw from the natural, the natural would not be anything. With regard to the origin of all things, every single thing comes from the Lord. From Him comes the celestial; by way of 
the celestial from Him the spiritual comes into being; by way of the spiritual comes the natural; by way of the natural comes that which constitutes the body and the senses. And just as these come into 
being from the Lord in this way, so in the same way they are kept in being, for as is well known, being kept in being is constant coming into being. People who assume that things arise and come into 
being in any other way, as those do who worship nature and trace the origin of things back to that, are governed by assumptions so dismal that the delusions of wild animals roaming the forest can be 
said to contain far more sanity. There are many such persons who seem to themselves to excel everybody else in wisdom.
