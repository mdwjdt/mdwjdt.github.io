<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5857节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5857.</strong>我有时与灵人谈论他们远远超越世人的这种能力，因为人一到来，他们就能为自己取得他记忆里的一切.我说，即便以前根本就不知道的各门知识、语言，或从幼儿直到老年所学习并吸收的其它东西，他们也能瞬间拥有。因此，在有学问的人中间，他们是有学问的；在聪明人中间，他们是聪明的；在审慎而明智的人中间，他们是审慎而明智的。听了这些话，他们得意洋洋，因为他们并非善灵。于是，我被引导又告诉他们说，在无知的人中间，他们是无知的；在迟钝的人中间，他们是迟钝的；在疯狂而愚蠢的人中间，他们是疯狂而愚蠢的。因为他们披上他们与之同在的那个的一切内层，因而也披上他的每一个幻觉，进而披上他的疯狂和愚笨。不过，恶灵无法靠近小孩子，因为小孩子的记忆里没有恶灵能披上的任何东西。因此，与小孩子同在的，是善灵和天使。</p>

I have sometimes spoken with spirits about the surpassing capacity they have above men for putting on at their first coming all things of the man's memory; and though they had previously known nothing 
of the sciences, of the languages, and other things which the man has learned and imbued from childhood even to old age, they nevertheless come in a moment into possession of all; so that with the learned 
they are learned, with the ingenious they are ingenious, and with the prudent they are prudent. At these remarks, those spirits became elated, for they were not good, and therefore it was given 
to tell them further that with the ignorant they are ignorant, and with the stupid they are stupid, with the insane and foolish they are insane and foolish; for they put on all the interiors of the man 
with whom they are, thus also his fallacies, phantasies, and falsities, consequently his insanities and follies. But evil spirits cannot approach little children, because these have not yet in their 
memory anything that evil spirits can put on; and therefore with little children there are good spirits and angels. </p>

I have spoken on several occasions to spirits about their ability, far superior to any that man has, to take to themselves everything in a person's memory the moment he arrives. I have said that even 
though they have had no previous knowledge at all of the branches of knowledge, the languages, or the particular matters that a person learns about and absorbs from infancy to old age, they nevertheless 
take possession of them all in an instant. Thus among the learned they are learned; among the clever they are clever; and among the judicious they are judicious. These things said by me have inflated 
those spirits with pride, for they were not good spirits. For that reason I was led to tell them also that when among the untaught they were untaught; when among the stupid they were stupid; and when 
among the senseless and foolish they were senseless and foolish. This is because they take to themselves everything existing interiorly in the person with whom they are present, including every one 
of his illusions, misconceptions, and false ideas, consequently his senseless and foolish notions. But evil spirits cannot get near young children because young children do not as yet have anything 
in their memory which those spirits can take to themselves. For this reason those present with young children are good spirits and angels. </p>

Locutus (t)sum aliquoties cum spiritibus de praeexcellente facultate quae illis prae homine, quod induant ad primum adventum omnia memoriae hominis, et {1} tametsi nihil sciverint prius de scientiis, 
de linguis, deque rebus quas homo ab infantia usque ad senectam didicit et imbuit, usque momento in possessionem omnium veniant; et quod ita apud eruditos sint eruditi, apud ingeniosos ingeniosi, apud 
prudentes prudentes. Ex his animosi facti sunt spiritus illi, erant enim non boni, quapropter ad illos etiam dicere datum est, {2} quod apud indoctos indocti sint, apud stupidos stupidi, apud insanos 
et fatuos insani et fatui, induunt enim omnia interiora hominis apud quem sunt, ita quoque omnes ejus fallacias, phantasias et falsa, {3}consequenter ejus insanias et fatuitates. Ad infantes autem 
mali spiritus non possunt accedere, {4}quia nondum aliquid habent in memoria quod induant; quare apud illos sunt boni spiritus et angeli. @1 i quod$ @2 i quod hoc non solum fiat, sed etiam$ @3 etiam$ @4 nam$ </p>
