<p><strong>[NCE]179.</strong> As soon as the internal organs of the body grow cold, our living substances, wherever they are located, are separated out. This would happen even if they were lost in the thousand interlinking passages of a labyrinth.{*1} The Lord's mercy, which I had already experienced as a living and powerful pull, is so strong that it could not leave any living element behind.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "interlinking passages of a labyrinth," labyrintheis nexibus, may be an allusion to the phrase labyrintheis ... flexibus, "the labyrinthine windings," which occurs in an ancient Latin poem about the original labyrinth in Greco-Roman mythology (Catullus 64:114). Here Swedenborg seems also to be obliquely referring to a criticism raised by Deism, a philosophical outlook that during his lifetime could be defined roughly as a belief in God based on inborn knowledge, reason, and experience, without acceptance of revelation or traditional religion. The Deists mocked as impossible and absurd the idea that at the Last Judgment the physical bodies of the dead were to be reconstituted by God, no matter where their component parts had ended up over the millennia (see a sample of such a critique in Voltaire [1764] 1962, 452 [under "Resurrection," second section]). This common Christian doctrine, based on various passages of the Bible, including <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_179/bible_king-james-version_revelation_20_13" target=_top>Revelation 20:13</a>, was also rejected by Swedenborg (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_179/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5078#subsection-2-3" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 5078:3</a>); but in the present passage, he reserves to divine power the ability to reconstitute the nonphysical "living substances" of the dead, no matter what the circumstances of their final disposition at death. For more on the Last Judgment in Swedenborg's theology, see notes 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_179/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32" target=_top>32:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_179/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4" target=_top>4</a> in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_179/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931#subsection-2-2" target=_top>931:2</a>.

As soon as the internal parts of the body grow cold, the vital substances are separated from the man, wherever they may be, even if inclosed in a thousand labyrinthine interlacings, for such is the efficacy 
of the Lord's mercy (which I had previously perceived as a living and mighty attraction), that nothing vital can remain behind. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 179</b></p><p><b>179.</b>
As soon as the interior parts of the body start to grow cold, the vital substances are separated from the person, wherever these may be, even if enclosed in a thousand complicated entanglements. For 
the effectiveness of the Lord's mercy, which I had already experienced as a living power of attraction, is so great that nothing vital can remain behind.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 179</b>
</p><b>179.</b>
Vitales substantiae, ut primum frigescunt corporea interiora, separantur ab homine, ubicumque sunt, si vel inclusae forent mille labyrintheis nexibus; nam talis est efficacia Misericordiae Domini, quae 
mihi prius percepta, sicut {1} attractio viva et valida, sic ut nihil vitale remanere possit. @   1 Attracto I.$ </p>
