<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6551节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6551.</strong>“在幔利对面”表质和量。这从“幔利”的含义明显可知，“幔利”是指被联结之物的质和量（参看<a href="2970.htm">2970</a>，<a href="2980.htm">2980</a>，<a href="4613.htm">4613</a>，<a href="6456.htm">6456</a>节）。亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买幔利前面麦比拉田间的洞表示某种特定事物，这一点从以下事实明显看出来，这些细节重复过多次，如创世记前面的章节：<br />以弗仑在幔利前面麦比拉的那块田，都定准了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.17.htm">23:17</a>）<br />还有：<br />此后，亚伯拉罕把他妻子撒拉埋葬在幔利对面的麦比拉田间的洞里。那块田和其中的洞，就由赫人定准，归与亚伯拉罕作坟墓的产业。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.19.htm">23:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.20.htm">20</a>）<br /><br />他们把亚伯拉罕埋葬在麦比拉洞里，在幔利对面、赫人琐辖的儿子以弗仑的田中；就是亚伯拉罕向赫人买的那块田。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.9.htm">25:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />就是在迦南地幔利对面的麦比拉田间的洞里，那田是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来作坟墓产业的。那块田和田间的洞，原是向赫人买的。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.30.htm">49:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.32.htm">32</a>）<br />本章：<br />他们将他埋葬在麦比拉田间的洞里，那田是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来作坟墓产业的，在幔利对面。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.13.htm">50:13</a>）<br />对几乎相同的话的这种经常性重复表示某种特定事物，是因为“亚伯拉罕”、“以撒”、“雅各”代表主；“埋葬他们”表示恢复和复活；“麦比拉田间的洞”表示重生的开始；“赫人以弗仑”代表那些接受信之真理，并允许自己重生的人；“赫人”代表一个属灵教会。正因所有这些话合起来以简要的方式表示一个属灵教会的建立，所以这些细节才重生这么多次。</p>

Upon the faces of Mamre. That this signifies the quality and the quantity, is evident from the signification of "Mamre," as being the quality and quantity of that to which it is joined (see n. 2970, 
2980, 4613, 6456). That something special is signified by Abraham's having bought the cave of the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, from Ephron the Hittite, is evident from its being said so 
many times, as in previous chapters: </p>
<p>     The field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, was made sure (Gen. 23:17).      After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of 
the field of Machpelah upon the faces of Mamre. And the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a sepulcher from the sons of Heth (Gen. 23:19, 20).      They 
buried Abraham in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is upon the faces of Mamre; the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth (Gen. 25:9, 10).  
    Bury me in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is upon the faces of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, for a possession of 
a sepulcher. The purchase of the field, and of the cave that is therein, was from the sons of Heth (Gen. 49:30-32). And in this chapter: </p>
<p>     They buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, 
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a sepulcher, from Ephron the Hittite, upon the faces of Mamre (Gen. 50:13). The special thing which is signified by this frequent repetition in 
nearly the same words, is that by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is represented the Lord; by their burial is represented resurrection and resuscitation; by the cave of the field of Machpelah, the beginning 
of regeneration; by Ephron the Hittite, those who receive the good of faith and suffer themselves to be regenerated; and by the sons of Heth, the spiritual church. And it is because all these things 
combined signify the setting up again of a spiritual church that they are so many times repeated. </p>

'Facing Mamre' means nature and extent. This is clear from the meaning of 'Mamre' as the nature and extent of what it is used in connection with, dealt with in <a href="2970.htm">2970</a>, <a href="4613.htm">4613</a>, <a href="6456.htm">6456</a>. Something special is 
meant when it is said that Abraham had bought the cave of the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, from Ephron the Hittite, as may be recognized from the fact that these details are repeated so 
often, as in Genesis <a href="23.htm">23</a>, </p>
<p>The field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah - which was before Mamre - was made over. . . Verse 17. </p>
<p>In addition to this, </p>
<p>After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife at 
the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre. Verse 19. </p>
<p>And yet again, </p>
<p>The field and the cave which was in it were made over to Abraham as a possession for a grave, from the sons of Heth. Verse 20. </p>
<p>Also in Genesis <a href="25.htm">25</a>, </p>
<p>They buried Abraham at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which faced Mamre. The field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth 
. . . Verses 9, 10. </p>
<p>In Genesis <a href="49.htm">49</a>, </p>
<p>Bury me in the cave which is in the field of Machpelah, which faces Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite 
as a possession for a grave. The buying of the field and the cave that was in it was from the sons of Heth. Verses 30-32. </p>
<p>And in the present chapter, </p>
<p>They buried him in the cave of the field 
of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought with the field, as a possession for a grave, from Ephron the Hittite - facing Mamre. Something special is meant by this frequent repetition involving practically 
the same words, for the following reason: 'Abraham', 'Isaac', and 'Jacob' represent the Lord; 'the burial of them' represents resurrection and restoration to life, 'the field of the cave of Machpelah' 
the beginning of regeneration, 'Ephron the Hittite' those who receive the good of faith and allow themselves to be regenerated, and 'the sons of Heth' a spiritual Church. Thus because these words in 
a brief way mean the establishment of a spiritual Church, the same details are repeated so many times. </p>

`Super facies Mamre': quod significet quale et quantum, constat (c)ex significatione `Mamre' quod sit quale et quantum rei cui adjungitur, de qua n. 2970, 4613, 6456(x).  Quod peculiare aliquod significetur 
per quod `Abraham emerat speluncam agri Machpelah quae coram Mamre, ab Ephrone Hittaeo', constare potest ex eo quod id tam saepe repetatur, ut Gen. xxiii Constitit ager Ephronis, qui in Machpelah, 
quae coram Mamre, vers. 17: </p>
<p>{1}porro, Post ita, sepelivit Abraham Saram uxorem suam ad speluncam agri Machpelah, super facies Mamre: </p>
<p>(c)ac iterum, Constitit ager et spelunca quae in illo, Abrahamo 
ad  possessionem sepulcri, ex filiis Hethi, ibid. vers. 19, 20: </p>
<p>tum Gen. xxv, Sepeliverunt Abrahamum ad speluncam Machpelae, ad agrum Ephronis, filii Zohar, Hittaei, quae super facies Mamre; 
agrum quem emit Abraham a filiis Hethi, vers. 9, 10: </p>
<p>Gen. xlix, Sepelite me in spelunca, quae in agro Machpelah, quae super facies Mamre, in terra Canaan, quam emit Abraham cum agro ex Ephrone Hittaeo, 
ad possessionem sepulcri.  Emptio agri et speluncae,quae in illo, ex filiis Hethi, vers. 30, 31, [32]: </p>
<p>et in hoc capite, Sepeliverunt illum in spelunca agri Machpelah, quam emerat Abraham cum agro 
ad possessionem sepulcri ex Ephrone Hittaeo, super facies Mamre. Peculiare quod significet frequens haec repetitio paene similibus verbis, est quia per `Abrahamum, Jishakum et Jacobum' repraesentatur 
Dominus; per `sepulturam illorum' resurrectio et resuscitatio; per `speluncam agri Machpelae' regenerationis principium; per `Ephronem Hittaeum' illi qui bonum fidei recipiunt et se regenerari patiuntur; 
(c)et per `filios Hethi' Ecclesia spiritualis; ita quia illa in summa significant instaurationem Ecclesiae spiritualis {2}, ideo toties eadem repetuntur. @1 mox$ @2 i a Domino, post Adventum 
et resurrectionem Ipsius$ </p>
