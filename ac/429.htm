<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第429节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>429.</strong>“男人”表信，这一点从本章第一节明显可知，因为当夏娃生下该隐后，就说“我得了一个男人，耶和华”，以此表信之教义，被称为“一个男人，耶和华”。这也从前文有关一个男人或男性所述清楚可知，男人表觉知（understanding），信属于觉知。由此清楚可知，他还灭绝了仁，仁在此被称为“小孩子”，因为凡否认和杀害信者，同时也否认和杀害了仁，因为仁从信生出。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]429.</strong> The symbolism of a man as faith can be seen from the first verse of this chapter, in which Eve delivered Cain and said, "I have acquired the man Jehovah." This meant the doctrine concerning faith, which was called "the man Jehovah" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340" target=_top>340</a>]. It can also be seen from earlier remarks [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_158" target=_top>158</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_429/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265" target=_top>265</a>] showing that a man symbolizes the intellect, since the intellect is connected with faith.<br />From this it is apparent that Lamech also destroyed charity, which is called a little child, because anyone who denies or murders faith also denies and murders the charity that is being born through faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 429</b></p><p><b>429.</b>
That by a "man" [vir] is signified faith, is evident from the first verse of this chapter, in that Eve said, when she bare Cain, "I have gotten a man Jehovah;" by whom was meant the doctrine of faith, 
called a "man Jehovah." It is evident also from what was shown above concerning a man or male, that he signifies understanding, which is of faith. That he had also extinguished charity, here called 
a "little one" or a "little child" follows, for he who denies and murders faith, at the same time also denies and murders the charity that is born from faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 429</b></p><p><b>429.</b>
That 'a man' (vir) means faith is clear from the first verse of this chapter where Eve said, after giving birth to Cain, 'I have gained a man, Jehovah', by which is meant the doctrine of faith, called 
'a man, Jehovah'. It is also clear from what has been shown already about 'a man' (vir) meaning the understanding, to which faith belongs. From this it is clear that he also annihilated charity, which 
is called 'a little one', that is, a little child, for anyone who denies, or murders, faith at the same time denies and murders charity to which faith gives birth.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 429</b>
</p><b>429.</b>
Quod per 'virum' significetur fides, constat a versu primo hujus capitis, quod dixerit Havah, cum pepererat Cain, 'acquisivi virum Jehovam,' quo fidei doctrina intellecta, et vocata 'vir Jehovah'; constat 
etiam ab iis quae prius ostensa sunt de 'viro,' quod significet intellectum, qui est fidei. Quod etiam exstinxerit charitatem, quae vocatur 'parvulus' seu puerulus, inde constat; nam qui negat 
seu negat fidem, simul etiam negat et negat charitatem per fidem nascentem.
