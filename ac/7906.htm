<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7906节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7906.</strong>“在你们各家中，不可有酵”表任何虚假都不可接近良善。这从“酵”和“家”的含义清楚可知：“酵”是指虚假，如下文所述；“家”是指良善（参看<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>，<a href="7833.htm">7833</a>-<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>节）。“酵”是指虚假，这一点从提及“酵”、“发酵”、以及“无酵”的经文可以看出来，如马太福音：<br />耶稣对他们说，你们要谨慎，防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。后来门徒才明白，祂不是叫他们防备饼的酵，乃是防备法利赛人和撒都该人的教训。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.6.htm">16:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处“酵”明显表示虚假的教义。由于“酵”表示虚假，所以不可将祭牲的血和有酵的东西一同献上（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.18.htm">23:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.25.htm">34:25</a>）。因为“祭牲的血”表示神圣真理，因而表示摆脱一切虚假的纯粹真理4735，6978，7317，7326，7846，7850节）。经上来规定，献在坛上的素祭烤的时候，不可搀酵（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.17.htm">6:17</a>）；饼和薄饼也要无酵的（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.11.htm">7:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.13.htm">13</a>）。<br />关于有酵之物和无酵之物，要进一步知道，若不经所谓的发酵，也就是虚假与真理并真理与虚假的争战，真理从虚假中洁净是不可能在人里面实现的。但进行争战，并且真理得胜之后，虚假会像渣滓一样沉落，而真理得以净化，显露出来。这就是像葡萄酒发酵后变得清澈，酒渣则沉到底部。这种发酵或争战主要发生在人的状态发生改变之时，也就是当他开始出于仁之良善，而非像以前那样出于信之真理行事之时。因为当此人出于信之真理行事是，这种状态还没有得到洁净；但当他出于仁之良善行事时，它就得到洁净了；因为这时他出于意愿行事；而以前仅出于理解力行事。<br />属灵的争战或试探就是灵义上的发酵；因为在争战或试探期间，虚假想与真理联结；但真理拒绝它们，最终可以说把它们沉到底部，以这种方式得以提纯、净化。主在马太福音中关于面酵的教导要在这层意义上来理解：<br />天国好像面酵，有妇人拿来，藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.33.htm">13:33</a>）<br />“面”是指良善所来自的真理。还有在何西阿书：<br />他们都是行淫的，像火炉被烤饼的烧热，从抟面到发面的时候，暂不使火着旺。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.4.htm">7:4</a>）<br />由于如前所述，“发酵”所表示的这类争战在一个人获得生命新样之前的状态下发生在他身上，所以经上还规定：当在初熟节献上新素祭时，摇祭的饼要加酵烤成，当作初熟之物献给耶和华（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.16.htm">23:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.17.htm">17</a>）。</p>

Shall no leaven be found in your houses. That this signifies that nothing whatever of falsity shall come near good, is evident from the signification of "leaven," as being falsity (of which in what follows); 
and from the signification of "house," as being good (see n. 3652, 3720, 4982, 7833-7835). That "leaven" denotes falsity can be seen from those passages where "leaven" and "leavened" and also 
"unleavened" are mentioned, as in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said unto them, See ye and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. Afterward the disciples understood that He had not said that 
they should beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 16:6, 12); </p>
<p>where "leaven" manifestly means false doctrine. As "leaven" signified falsity, it was 
forbidden to sacrifice upon what was leavened the blood of the sacrifice (Exod. 23:18; 34:25); for by the "blood of the sacrifice" was signified holy truth, thus truth. pure from all falsity (n. 4735, 
6978, 7317, 7326, 7846, 7850). It was also ordained that the meat-offering which was to be offered upon the altar was not to be baked leavened (Lev. 6:17); and that the cakes and wafers also should 
be unleavened (Lev. 7:11-13). [2] As further regards what is leavened and what is unleavened, be it known that the purification of truth from falsity with man cannot possibly exist without fermentation 
so called, that is, without the combat of falsity with truth and of truth with falsity; but after combat has existed, and truth has conquered, then falsity falls down like dregs, and the truth comes 
forth purified, like wine which grows clear after fermentation, the dregs falling to the bottom. This fermentation or combat exists chiefly when the state with man is being changed, that is, when 
he begins to act from the good that is of charity, and not as before from the truth that is of faith; for the state has not as yet been purified when the man acts from the truth of faith, but it has been 
purified when he acts from the good which is of charity; for then he acts from the will; previously only from the understanding. [3] Spiritual combats or temptations are fermentations in the spiritual 
sense; for then falsities are desirous to conjoin themselves with truths; but truths reject them, and finally cast them down as it were to the bottom, consequently they purify. In this sense is 
to be understood what the Lord teaches about leaven in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The kingdom of the heavens is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened 
(Matt. 13:33); </p>
<p>"meal" denotes the truth from which is good. Also in Hosea: </p>
<p>     They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker; the stirrer ceaseth from the kneading of the dough until it 
be leavened (Hos. 7:4). Because, as before said, such combats as are signified by fermentations arise with man in the state previous to newness of life; therefore it was also ordained that when the 
new meat-offering on the feast of the first-fruits was offered, the bread of waving was to be baked leavened, and was to be the first-fruits to Jehovah (Lev. 23:16, 17). </p>

'No yeast shall be found in your houses' means no falsity whatever shall come near good. This is clear from the meaning of 'yeast' as falsity, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'house' as good, 
dealt with in <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>-<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>. The meaning of 'yeast' as falsity becomes clear from the places where yeast and anything made with yeast, and also where unleavened and anything made without 
yeast are mentioned, such as in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Look out for and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then the disciples understood that He had not said that they should beware 
of the yeast used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:6,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:6, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'yeast' plainly stands for false teaching. Because 'yeast' meant falsity it was forbidden to 
sacrifice the blood of the sacrifice with anything made with yeast, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:18;%2034:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:18; 34:25</a>. For 'the blood of the sacrifice' meant holy truth, thus truth pure and free from all falsity, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7846.htm">7846</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>. It was also laid down that the minchah offered on the altar should not be baked with yeast in it, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:15-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:15-17</a>, and that cakes and wafers also should be made without yeast, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%207:11-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 7:11-13</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
To go further with what 'made with yeast' and 'not made with yeast' refer to, it should be recognized that the purification of truth from falsity cannot ever come about in a person without 
so called fermentation, that is, without the conflict of falsity with truth and of truth with falsity. But after the conflict has taken place and truth has triumphed, the falsity falls away like dregs 
and the truth emerges purified. It is like wine that becomes clear after fermentation as the dregs sink to the bottom. That fermentation or conflict takes place especially when a person's state undergoes 
a change, that is to say, when his actions begin to spring from the good of charity, and not as previously from the truth of faith. For a person's state is not yet made pure while his actions spring 
from the truth of faith, but they have been made pure when they spring from the good of charity, since they now spring from his will. Previously they sprang merely from his understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Spiritual conflicts or temptations are fermentations in the spiritual sense, for during them falsities wish to link themselves to truths, but the truths reject them, eventually sending them to the bottom 
so to speak and in that way becoming refined. This is the sense in which to understand what the Lord teaches about 'yeast' in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took 
and hid in three measures of flour, until the whole was fermented by it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Flour' is truth from which good is derived. Also in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
They are all committing adultery, like an oven heated 
by a baker; the raiser<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> ceases from kneading the dough until it has fermented. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%207:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 7:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Since such conflicts, meant by 'fermentations', take place with a person in the state before he attains 
newness of life, as has been stated, it was also laid down that the new minchah, the bread of the wave-offering, that was to be brought at the feast of first fruits, should be baked with yeast; and 
that was to be the first fruits to Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2013:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 13:16, 17</a>.

`Fermentum non invenietur in domibus vestris': quod significet quod prorsus nihil falsi accedet ad bonum, constat ex significatione `fermenti' quod sit falsum, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione 
`domus' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 3652, 3720, 4982, 7833-7835.  Quod `fermentum' sit falsum, constare potest ab illis locis ubi fermentum ac fermentatum, tum ubi azymum (c)et infermentatum, nominantur, 
prout apud Matthaeum, Jesus dixit, Videte et cavete a fermento Pharisaeorum et Sadducaeorum; postea intellexerunt discipuli quod non dixisset ut caverent a fermento panis, sed a doctrina Pharisaeorum 
et Sadducaeorum, xvi 6, 12; </p>
<p>ibi `fermentum' manifeste pro falsa doctrina.  Quia `fermentum' significabat falsum, interdictum fuit Sacrificare super {1}fermentato sanguinem sacrificii, Exod. xxiii 
18, xxxiv 25; </p>
<p>per `sanguinem' enim `sacrificii' significabatur sanctum verum, ita verum ab omni falso purum, n. 4735, (x)6978, 7317, 7326, 7846, 7850: tum statutum quod Minhah quae offereretur super 
altari non coqueretur fermentata, Lev. vi [8,] 9, 10 [A.V. 15-17]: </p>
<p>{2}quodque Placentae et lagana {3}etiam essent infermentata, Lev. vii 11-13 [A.V. 15-17]. 	2 Quod fermentatum et infermentatum ulterius 
attinet, sciendum quod purificatio veri a falso apud hominem nusquam existere possit absque fermentatione ita dicta, hoc est, absque falsi pugna cum vero et veri cum falso; sed postquam pugna 
exstiterat ac verum vicerat, tunc falsum sicut faex decidit et verum existit purificatum; {4}prout vinum, quod post fermentationem clarescit faecibus ad fundum decidentibus; fermentatio illa, seu pugna, 
existit imprimis cum vertitur status apud hominem, nempe cum ille incipit agere ex bono quod charitatis, et non ut prius ex vero quod fidei; nam status (t)non adhuc purificatus est cum homo agit ex 
vero fidei, at tunc purificatus est cum ex bono quod charitatis, tunc enim ex voluntate agit, prius modo ex intellectu. 	3 Pugnae spirituales seu tentationes sunt fermentationes in spirituali sensu, 
nam tunc falsa se volunt conjungere veris, sed vera respuunt illa, et tandem dejiciunt illa quasi ad fundum, proinde defaecant; in hoc sensu intelligendum {5} quod Dominus de fermento docet apud Matthaeum, Simile 
est regnum caelorum fermento quod accipiens mulier abscondidit in farinae satis tribus, donec fermentaretur totum, xiii 33; </p>
<p>`farina' est verum ex quo bonum: tum apud Hoscheam, Omnes adulterantes, 
sicut clibanus incensus a pistore, cessat excitator a subigendo massam usque ad fermentationem ejus, vii 4. Quia, ut dictum, apud hominem tales pugnae quae per `fermentationes' significantur 
in statu ante novum vitae {6} existunt, idcirco etiam statutum est quod cum Minhah nova festo primitiarum (x)adferretur, panis motitationis, fermentata coqueretur, et quod id primitiae Jehovae,
