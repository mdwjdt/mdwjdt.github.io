<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2742节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2742．有的人看似具有婚姻之爱，但若他们没有对良善与真理的爱，那爱就不是婚姻之爱。它看似婚姻之爱，不过是为了对这个世界或自我的爱，比如为在家中得到伺候，为获得安全感，为相安无事，为在病老时有人照顾，为抚养所爱的孩子，或因惧怕对方，或为了名声，或害怕遭受不幸，或因淫欲。这爱在最初的日子看似婚姻之爱，是因为那时他们表现出某种纯真的意味，象小孩子那样一起玩耍，并感受到如同天堂般的喜悦。但随着时间推移，他们不象那些具有婚姻之爱的人那样变得越来越亲密，而是日益疏离。婚姻之爱在配偶双方当中也有所不同，可能一人爱多点或少点，一人爱极少，甚至没有。由于这种不同，故这爱对于一人可能是天堂，对于另一人却可能是地狱。其中，情感和接受是决定性因素。</p>

A certain semblance of conjugial love is found with some, but is not really that unless they are in the love of good and truth. It is a love appearing like conjugial love, but it is for the sake of the 
love of the world or of self, namely, to be served at home, or to be in security or at ease, or to be ministered to when ill and when growing old; or for the sake of the care of their children whom 
they love. With some this seeming love is induced from fear of the consort, or for one's reputation, or fear of misfortunes; and with some from lascivious love. This appears in the first period as if 
it were conjugial love; for at that time they behave with something like innocence, they sport like little children, they have a perception of joy as of something from heaven; but with the progress of 
time they do not become united more and more closely, like those who are in conjugial love, but are being separated. Conjugial love also differs with the consorts; with the one it may be more or less, 
with the other little or nothing; and because of this difference there may be heaven for the one, but hell for the other. The affection and the reception determine this. </p>

Something resembling conjugial love exists with some, but it is not in fact that love if the love of good and truth is not present in those persons. It is a love that seems like conjugial love, but the 
reasons for it lie in love of the world and self-love, that is to say, so that they may be waited on at home, have no cares, take their ease, be looked after when unwell and growing old, and so that 
their children whom they love may be cared for. With some this semblance of conjugial love is forced upon them out of fear of their partner, or for their reputation, or of ill fortunes; with some it 
is the love of licentiousness that induces it. This latter love appears in the early days as if it were conjugial love, for at that time they display something seemingly of innocence, playing about together 
like young children and feeling a joy as though of heaven. But they do not with the passing of time become more closely united to each other, as those do with whom conjugial love exists, but are 
becoming set apart. Conjugial love also differs among married couples; with one partner it may be greater or less, with the other little or none. And because of this difference it may for one be heaven, 
and for the other hell, affection and reception being the determining factors in this. </p>

Datur quoddam instar amoris conjugialis apud quosdam, sed usque non est si non in amore boni et veri sunt, est amor apparens sicut conjugialis, sed est ex causis amoris mundi aut sui, nempe ut serviantur 
domi, ut in securo sint, ut in otio, ut ministrentur cum non bene valent, et senescunt, ob curam liberorum quos amant {1}; quibusdam est coactum ex timore pro conjuge, pro fama, pro malis; quibusdam 
est amor lasciviae qui inducit, hic apparet primo tempore sicut conjugialis, tunc enim aliquid innocentiae aemulantur, ludunt sicut infantes, (o)et percipiunt gaudium sicut aliquid ex caelesti, at 
successu temporis non uniuntur, sicut illi qui in amore conjugiali sunt, magis et arctius, sed separantur. (m)Amor conjugialis etiam differt apud conjuges, apud unum potest esse plus aut minus, apud 
alterum parum vel nihil, et quia differt, uni potest esse caelum, alteri infernum, affectio et receptio (t)determinant haec (n). 	@1 i etiam.$ </p>
