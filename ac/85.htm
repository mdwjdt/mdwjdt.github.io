<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第85节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>85.</strong>对于第七日象征属天之人，因而被定为圣日，称为“安息日”，时至今日，这些尚是不为人知的奥秘。因为了解属天之性的人罕有，了解属灵之性的人也不多，以致属灵之人被等同于属天之人，尽管两者之间存在着巨大的差别（参<a href="81.htm">81</a>节）。<br />对于第七日，安息日，象征属天之人，这从主本身是安息日可知，他说：“人子也是安息日的主。”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可2.27.htm">2:27</a>）这话表示主就是人本身，就是安息日本身。天堂和教会也因为他而被称为安息日或永远的平安。此处所论及的上古教会尤其是主的安息日，胜过所有后来的教会。后来的教会，其核心的部分也是一个安息日。每个重生之人，当他成为属天者，也是一个安息日，因他已成为主的样式。之前的六日，则充满了冲突和苦楚。这些由犹太教的六日作工和第七日安息来象征，因为该教会所设立的所有典章都是象征主及其国度。<br />约柜的前行与停歇具有类似的象征义，因为旷野的行军象征冲突和试探，停歇则象征平安。因此，当约柜起行时，摩西说：“愿神兴起，使他的仇敌四散，叫那恨他的人，从他面前逃跑。”约柜停住时，他就说：“耶和华啊，求你回到以色列的千万人中。”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.35.htm">10:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.36.htm">36</a>）当约柜离开耶和华的山时，经上说它要“为他们寻找安歇的地方”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.33.htm">10:33</a>）。<br />以赛亚书以安息日描述属天之人的平安心境：“你若在安息日掉转你的脚步，在我圣日不以操作为喜乐，称安息日为可喜乐的，称耶和华的圣日为可尊重的。尊敬这日，不办自己的私事，不随自己的私意，不说自己的私话。你就以耶和华为乐。耶和华要使你乘驾地的高处，又以你祖雅各的产业养育你。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.13.htm">58:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.14.htm">14</a>）这是属天之人的品性，他不随自己的私欲，唯以主为乐，故能享受内在的平安和喜悦，即此处“乘驾地的高处”所象征的，也能享受外在的宁静和快乐，即此处“以你祖雅各的产业养育你”所象征的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]85.</strong> Lack of information is another reason why these secrets — that a person of heavenly character is the seventh day, that this explains the consecration of the seventh day, and that it was named "Sabbath" for the idea of rest — have continued to lie hidden. No one knows what a heavenly person is, and few what a spiritual person is. Inevitably, in their ignorance, people have considered a spiritual person the same as a heavenly one, when a rather large difference separates the two (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_81" target=_top>81</a>).<br />In regard to the seventh day, evidence that a heavenly person is the seventh day or Sabbath can be found in the identity of the Lord himself as the Sabbath. As he says, "The Son of Humankind is lord even of the Sabbath" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_mark_2_28" target=_top>Mark 2:28</a>), meaning that the Lord is the true human being and the Sabbath itself.<br />He calls his kingdom in the heavens and on earth the Sabbath, or eternal peace and rest.{*1} [2] The earliest church (the subject here) more than all later ones was the Lord's Sabbath.<br />In every subsequent church, the inmost part, closest to the Lord, has also been the Sabbath.<br />The same holds true for all regenerate people when they develop a heavenly nature, as they are then likenesses of the Lord. They are past the six days of conflict, or labor.<br />In the Jewish church, all these considerations were represented by the work days and by the seventh day, the Sabbath. That church had no customs that did not represent something about the Lord and his kingdom.<br />The ark represented the same kind of thing in its travels and its repose. Its travels in the wilderness represented conflict and trial; its repose, a time of peace. So when it set out on a journey, Moses said, "Rise, Jehovah, and let your enemies scatter, and let those who hate you run from your face;" and when it came to rest, he said, "Come back, Jehovah, to the countless thousands of Israel." This is from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_numbers_10_35-36" target=_top>Numbers 10:35-36</a>. Verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_numbers_10_33" target=_top>33</a>. of the same chapter portrays the ark as setting out from the mountain of Jehovah "to find rest for them."<br />[3] Isaiah uses the Sabbath to paint a picture of the heavenly person's quiet rest:<br />If you turn your foot back from the Sabbath by not doing your own desire on my holy day; if you refer to those things that belong to the Sabbath as pleasures honoring the holiness of Jehovah, and you honor [the Sabbath] by not going your own ways and not gaining your own desire or speaking a word [of your own]; then you will be a pleasure to Jehovah, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth and will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_58_13-14" target=_top>Isaiah 58:13-14</a>)<br />Heavenly people act not on their own desire but on the Lord's pleasure, which is his desire. So they are blessed with inner peace and happiness (their being "lifted up on the heights of the earth") and at the same time with outer calm and enjoyment (their being "fed with Jacob's inheritance").<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the association of the Lord's kingdom with the Sabbath, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8495" target=_top>8495</a> and the passages quoted there, including <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_56_7" target=_top>Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_17_24-25" target=_top>Jeremiah 17:24-25</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_85/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_20_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 20:12</a>.

That the celestial man is the "seventh day" and that the seventh day was therefore hallowed, and called the Sabbath, are arcana which have not hitherto been discovered. For none have been acquainted 
with the nature of the celestial man, and few with that of the spiritual man, whom in consequence of this ignorance they have made to be the same as the celestial man, notwithstanding the great difference 
that exists between them, as may be seen in n. 81. As regards the seventh day, and as regards the celestial man being the "seventh day" or "Sabbath" this is evident from the fact that the Lord Himself 
is the Sabbath; and therefore He says: </p>
<p>     The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath (Mark 2:27), which words imply that the Lord is Man himself, and the Sabbath itself. His kingdom in the heavens 
and on the earth is called, from Him, a Sabbath, or eternal peace and rest. [2] The Most Ancient Church, which is here treated of, was the Sabbath of the Lord above all that succeeded it. Every 
subsequent inmost church of the Lord is also a Sabbath; and so is every regenerate person when he becomes celestial, because he is a likeness of the Lord. The six days of combat or labor precede. These 
things were represented in the Jewish church by the days of labor, and by the seventh day, which was the Sabbath; for in that church there was nothing instituted which was not representative of the 
Lord and of His kingdom. The like was also represented by the ark when it went forward, and when it rested, for by its journeyings in the wilderness were represented combats and temptations, and by its 
rest a state of peace; and therefore, when it set forward, Moses said: </p>
<p>     Rise up, Jehovah, and let Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee before Thy faces. And when it rested, 
he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel (Num. 10:35-36). It is there said of the ark that it went from the Mount of Jehovah "to search out a rest for them" (Num. 
10:33).  [3] The rest of the celestial man is described by the Sabbath in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     If thou bring back thy foot from the Sabbath, so that thou doest not thy desire in the day of My holiness, 
and callest the things of the Sabbath delights to the holy of Jehovah, honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own desire, nor speaking a word; then shalt thou be delightful 
to Jehovah, and I will cause thee to be borne over the lofty things of the earth, and will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob (Isa. 58:13-14). Such is the quality of the celestial man that 
he acts not according to his own desire, but according to the good pleasure of the Lord, which is his "desire." Thus he enjoys internal peace and happiness-here expressed by "being uplifted over the 
lofty things of the earth"-and at the same time external tranquility and delight, which is signified by "being fed with the heritage of Jacob." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 85</b></p><p><b>85.</b>
That the celestial man is the seventh day, and that the seventh day was for that reason made holy and called the Sabbath from a word for 'rest', are as yet undisclosed arcana. This is because people 
have not known what the celestial man is, and few what the spiritual man is. In their ignorance they could not avoid making the latter the same as the celestial, when in fact there is a vast difference 
between them; see <a href="81.htm">81</a>. As regards the seventh day and the celestial man's being the seventh day or Sabbath, this is clear from the fact that the Lord Himself is the Sabbath, for which reason He also 
says,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%202:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 2:28</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These words embody the concept that the Lord is Man himself, and the Sabbath itself. He gives the name Sabbath, or eternal peace and 
rest, to His kingdom in heaven and on earth. The Most Ancient Church, which is the subject here, was the Lord's Sabbath more than any subsequent Church.   </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Every subsequent inmost Church has been 
a Sabbath of the Lord, and so is every regenerate person when he becomes celestial, since he is a likeness of the Lord. Six days of conflict or labour precede this. In the Jewish Church these things 
were represented by the work days, and by the seventh which was the Sabbath; for in that Church, everything that had been ordained was representative of the Lord and His kingdom. The Ark too had a similar 
representation when it was travelling and when it came to rest. Its travels through the wilderness represented conflicts and temptations, and its resting represented states of peace. This is why 
when it travelled Moses said, </p>
<blockquote>
Arise, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee from Your face.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And when it came to rest he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads 
of the thousands of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:35,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10:35, 36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The same portion of Scripture speaks of the Ark 'travelling from the mountain of Jehovah to search out rest for them'. ibid. Verse 33.  The Sabbath 
is used to describe the celestial man's rest in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, so that you do not your desire on My holy day, and you call the things which belong to the Sabbath 
delights honourable to the Holiness of Jehovah, and you honour it so that you do not your own ways, nor find your own desire and speak your own words, then you will be delightful to Jehovah, and 
I will have you carried over the high places of the earth, and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58:13, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The celestial man is such that he does not base his actions on his own desires 
but on what pleases the Lord; this is his desire. In this way he enjoys inward peace and happiness, here expressed by 'being carried up over the high places of the earth'. At the same time he enjoys 
outward contentment and joy, meant by 'being fed with the heritage of Jacob'.

Quod homo caelestis sit 'septimus dies,' et septimus dies inde sanctificatus, et dictus sabbatum a quiete, sunt arcana nondum detecta, etiam ex causa quia nesciverunt quid caelestis homo, pauci quid 
spiritualis, quem ii ex ignorantia non potuerant non eundem facere cum caelesti, cum tamen multa intercedit differentia, videatur n. 81. Quod septimum diem attinet, et quod caelestis homo sit 'septimus 
dies' seu sabbatum, constat ex eo quod Dominus Ipse sit Sabbatum, quare etiam dicit,       {1} Dominus est Filius Hominis et sabbati, Marc. ii 	x28, quae involvunt quod Dominus sit ipse Homo, et ipsum 
Sabbatum. Regnum Ipsius in caelis et in terris ab Ipso vocatur sabbatum, seu aeterna pax et quies. Ecclesia Antiquissima de qua hic, prae sequentibus erat Domini sabbatum.  [2] Omnis Ecclesia sequens 
intima Domini etiam est sabbatum: ita omnis regeneratus dum fit caelestis, quia est similitudo Domini; praecedunt sex dies pugnae seu laboris. Haec repraesentata sunt in Ecclesia Judaica per dies 
laboris, et per septimum qui sabbatum; nam in Ecclesia illa nihil non quod institutum, erat repraesentativum Domini et regni Ipsius: simile etiam repraesentatum est per 'arcam, cum proficisceretur et 
cum quiesceret'; per 'profectiones ejus in deserto' pugnae et tentationes, per 'quietem' status pacis, quare cum proficisceretur, dixit Moses,  	Surge Jehovah, et dispergantur inimici Tui, et fugiant 
osores Tui a faciebus Tuis; et cum quiesceret, dixit, Revertere Jehovah myriades {2} millium Israelis, Num. x 35, 36; </p>
<p>de arca ibi dicitur quod 'profecta a monte Jehovae, ad investigandum illis requiem,' 
ibid. vers. 33.  [3] Requies caelestis hominis per sabbatum describitur apud Esaiam, 	Si reducas a sabbato pedem tuum, ut non facias desiderium tuum, in die sanctitatis Meae, et voces illa, quae 
sunt sabbato delicias Sancto Jehovae, honorabiles, et honores illud, ut non facias vias tuas, nec invenias desiderium tuum, et loquaris verbum; tunc deliciosus eris Jehovae, et vehi faciam te super 
excelsa terra et cibabo te hereditate Jacobi, lviii 13, 14. Caelestis homo talis est ut non ex desiderio suo faciat, sed e beneplacito Domini, quod ejus desiderium est; sic fruitur pace felicitate interna, 
quae hic exprimitur per 'elevari super excelsa terrae et simul tranquillitate et jucunditate externa, quae significatur per' 'cibari hereditate Jacobi.' @	1 The order here is that of the Gk. Kyrios 
estin ho uios where uios is evidently the subject.  In T.C.R. 301 S. has Dominus dixit, quod etiam sit Dominus Sabbati.  1 has comma after Hominis, probably a printer's insertion.$ @	2 This is 
a literal rendering of the Heb.  See A.E. 700 for exposition.$
