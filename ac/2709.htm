<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2709节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2709.</strong>“成了弓箭手”表属灵教会成员。这从“标枪、矛或箭”和“弓”的含义清楚可知：“标枪、箭头或箭”是指真理；而“弓”是指教义（参看<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>节）。过去，属灵教会成员被称为“弓箭手”。这是因为他凭真理保卫自己，并讨论真理，完全不同于属天教会成员。属天教会成员凭良善得到保护，并不讨论真理（参看<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>节）。属灵教会成员用来保卫自己，并进行讨论的真理来自他所承认的教义。<br />属灵之人在过去被称为“弓箭手”和“射箭手”，那教义被称为“弓”和“箭袋”，并且教义的真理，确切地说，教义被称为“箭、标枪和矛”。这一事实从诗篇进一步明显看出来：<br />以法莲的子孙带着兵器，拿着弓，争战之日，转身退后。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.9.htm">78:9</a>）<br />“以法莲”表教会的觉性。士师记：<br />骑白驴的、坐绣花毯子的、行路的，你们都当思想！在他们当中弓箭响声打水之处，他们必述说耶和华的公义，就是祂对以色列乡民的公义。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.10.htm">5:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.11.htm">11</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华从子宫呼召我；自出母腹，祂就提我的名，祂使我的口好似利剑；将我藏在祂手荫之下，又使我成为磨亮的箭，将我藏在祂箭袋之中；对我说，你是我的仆人；以色列，我必因你得荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“以色列”表属灵教会。<br />诗篇：<br />少年时的儿女，好像勇士手中的箭；箭袋充满箭的人便为有福。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.4.htm">127:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“箭袋”表良善与真理的教义。哈巴谷书：<br />日月停在本位；你的箭射出发光，你的枪闪出光耀。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.11.htm">3:11</a>）<br />以色列的王约阿施按以利沙的命令，拿弓通过窗户射箭，而以利沙说“耶和华的救恩箭，就是耶和华攻打亚兰人的救恩箭” （列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下13.16.htm">13:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下13.18.htm">18</a>），则表示关于良善与真理的教义的奥秘。<br />由于在圣言中，绝多大数事物都具有反面意义，故“矛”、“标枪”、“箭”、“弓”和“弓箭手”同样具有反面意义；就反面意义而言，它们表虚假，就是教义的虚假，以及那些受虚假影响的人。如摩西书：<br />约瑟是多结果子的人，是泉旁多结果的人，女子啊，她循着城墙；他们使他悲伤，向他射箭，弓箭手仇恨他。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.22.htm">49:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.23.htm">23</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />他们用舌头射击，他们的弓是谎言，不是为真理；他们的舌头是加长的箭，说话诡诈。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.3.htm">9:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.8.htm">8</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他们磨舌如刀，比准了他们的箭，就是苦毒的言语，要在暗地射完全人；他们忽然射他，并不惧怕。他们为自己强作恶言，他们商量暗设网罗。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗64.3.htm">64:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗64.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />看哪，恶人弯弓，把箭搭在弦上，要在暗中射那心里正直的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.2.htm">11:2</a>）<br /><br />祂的真理是盾牌圆楯；你必不怕黑夜的恐怖，白日飞的箭。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.4.htm">91:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.5.htm">5</a>）</p>

And he became a shooter of the bow. That this signifies the man of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of a "shaft," "dart," or "arrow," as being truth; and from the signification 
of a "bow," as being doctrine (see above, n. 2686). The man of the spiritual church was formerly called a "shooter of the bow," because he defended himself by truths, and disputed about truths; differently 
from the man of the celestial church, who is secure by means of good, and does not dispute about truths (see above, n. 2708). The truths by which the man of the spiritual church defends himself, 
and respecting which he disputes, are from the doctrine which he acknowledges. [2] That the spiritual man was in old time called a "shooter" and an "archer," and that doctrine was called a "bow" and 
a "quiver," and that the truths of doctrine, or rather doctrinal matters, were called "darts," "shafts," and "arrows," is further evident in David: </p>
<p>     The sons of Ephraim, being armed, shooters of 
the bow, turned back in the day of battle (Ps. 78:9). "Ephraim" denotes the intellectual of the church. In the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     Consider, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit upon carpets, 
and ye that walk by the way; because of the voice of archers among them that draw water, there shall they rehearse the righteousnesses of Jehovah, the righteousnesses toward His villages in Israel (Judg. 
5:10-11). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of my name, and He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His 
hand hath He hid me, and He hath made me a polished arrow, in His quiver hath He hid me; and He said unto me, Thou art My servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified* (Isa. 49:1-3). "Israel" denotes 
the spiritual church. [3] In David: </p>
<p>     As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of the youth; happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them (Ps. 127:4); </p>
<p>a "quiver" 
denotes the doctrine of good and truth. In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     The sun and moon stood still in their seat; at the light of Thine arrows shall they go, at the shining of the lightning of Thy spear (Hab. 3:11). That 
Joash king of Israel shot an arrow from a bow through the window, at the command of Elisha, while Elisha said, "The arrow of the salvation of Jehovah, the arrow of the salvation of Jehovah 
against the Syrian" (2 Kings 13:16 to 18), signifies arcana concerning the doctrine of good and truth. [4] As most of the things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so likewise have "shafts," "darts," 
"arrows," "bows," and a "shooter;" and they signify falsities, the doctrine of falsity, and those who are in falsity. Thus in Moses: </p>
<p>     Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful 
one by a fountain, of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall; they grieved him, and shot at him, and the archers hated him (Gen. 49:22, 23). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They have shot out their tongue, 
their bow is a lie, and not for truth; their tongue is a lengthened arrow, it speaketh deceit (Jer. 9:3, 8). In David: </p>
<p>     They have sharpened their tongue like a sword, they have aimed their arrow, 
a bitter word, to shoot in secret places at the perfect; suddenly will they shoot at him, and will not fear. They will make strong for themselves an evil word, they will tell of the hiding of snares 
(Ps. 64:4-6). In the same: </p>
<p>     Lo, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart (Ps. 11:2). In the same: </p>
<p>     His truth 
is a shield and buckler; thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, for the arrow that flieth by day (Ps. 91:4-5). * Quia in te gloriabor; but in quo gloriosus reddar, n. 3441. [Rotch ed.] </p>

'And was an archer' means the member of the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'darts, arrows, or shafts' as truth, and from the meaning of 'a bow' as doctrine, dealt with above in <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>. 
The member of the spiritual Church was in former times called 'an archer' because such a member uses truths to defend himself, and discusses truths, unlike the member of the celestial Church who 
is protected by good and does not discuss truths, see above in <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>. The truths which the member of the spiritual Church uses to defend himself and which he discusses are derived from the doctrine he 
acknowledges.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the spiritual man was in former times called 'an archer' and 'a bowman', and that doctrine was called a bow and a quiver, and the truths of doctrine, or rather matters 
of doctrine, were called arrows, darts, and shafts, is further clear in David, </p>
<blockquote>
The children of Ephraim who were armed (they were archers) turned back on the day of battle. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Ephraim' 
stands for the intellectual side of the Church. In the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
You who ride white she-asses, you who sit on Middin,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and you who walk along the way, may you ponder. From the voice of the 
bowmen among those drawing water, there they will discuss the righteous acts of Jehovah, the righteous acts of His village in Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:%2010,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5: 10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah. </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah called me from the womb, 
from my mother's body<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> He made mention of my name and set my mouth like a sharp sword. In the shadow of His hand He hid me and turned me into a polished arrow; in His quiver He hid me, and He said 
to me, You are My servant Israel, for I will be glorified in you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:%201-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49: 1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Israel' stands for the spiritual Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Like arrows in the hand of a powerful man so are the children 
of the days of one's youth. Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20127:%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 127: 4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A quiver' stands for the doctrine of good and truth. In Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
The sun, the moon, stood 
still in their place. At the light of Your arrows they will go, at the flash of Your glittering spear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3: 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the reference to Joash king of Israel who at Elisha's command shot the arrow 
from the bow through the window, with Elisha saying as he shot it, Jehovah's arrow of salvation, Jehovah's arrow of salvation against the Syrian, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 13: <a href="16.htm">16</a>-<a href="18.htm">18</a>, arcana to do with the doctrine of 
good and truth are meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since most things in the Word also possess a contrary sense, darts, arrows, shafts, bows, and archers accordingly possess such. In that contrary sense they mean falsities, 
doctrine that teaches what is false, and those who are under the influence of falsity, as in Moses, </p>
<p>The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one beside a spring, O daughters,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> 
he trails over the wall; and they bitterly grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him did the archers. Gen. 49: <a href="22.htm">22</a>, <a href="23.htm">23</a>. </p>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>They shot with their tongue, their bow is a bow of lies 
and not used for truth. Their tongue is a shaft extended; it speaks deceit. Jer 9: <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>. </p>
<p>In David, </p>
<p>They sharpened their tongue like a sword, they aimed their shaft, a bitter word, to shoot in 
secret places at the upright; they will shoot suddenly and will not fear him. They will make strong for </p>
<p>themselves an evil matter; they will tell of laying snares secretly. Ps. 64: <a href="3.htm">3</a>-<a href="5.htm">5</a>. </p>
<p>In the same 
author, </p>
<p>Behold, the evil bend the bow, they make ready their shaft upon the string, to shoot in thick darkness itself at the upright in heart. Ps. 11: <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<p>His truth is 
a shield and buckler; you will not be afraid of the terror of the night, of the shaft that flies by day. Ps. 91: <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>.

`Et fuit jaculator arcus': quod significet spiritualis Ecclesiae hominem, constat a significatione `jaculi, teli, seu sagittae' quod {1} sit verum, et a significatione `arcus' quod sit doctrina, de 
quibus supra n. 2686. Spiritualis Ecclesiae homo olim `jaculator arcus' est dictus, quia per vera se defendit, et de veris disserit, secus ac caelestis Ecclesiae homo, qui ex bono tutus est, ac de veris 
non disserit, videatur supra n. 2708; vera per quae spiritualis Ecclesiae homo se defendit, et de quibus disserit, sunt ex doctrina quam agnoscit: [2] quod spiritualis homo olim dictus sit `jaculator' 
et `sagittarius,' et doctrina dicta (o)sit (t)arcus et pharetra, et vera doctrinae, seu potius doctrinalia, (o)dicta sint tela, jacula et sagittae, constat porro apud Davidem, 	Filii Ephraimi armati, 
jaculatores arcus, averterunt se in die praelii, Ps. lxxviii 9; </p>
<p>`Ephraim' pro intellectuali Ecclesiae: in Libro Judicum, 	Equitantes asinas candidas, sedentes super Middim {2}, et ambulantes super 
via, meditemini; a voce sagittariorum inter haurientes, ibi disserent justitias Jehovae, justitias villae ejus in Israel, v 10, 11: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Jehovah ab utero vocavit me, a visceribus matris 
meae memorare fecit nomen meum, et posuit os meum sicut gladium acutum; in umbra manus Suae abscondidit me, et posuit me in sagittam purgatam, in pharetra Sua occultavit me, et dixit mihi, Servus Meus 
tu Israel, quia in te gloriabor, xlix 1-3; </p>
<p>[3] `Israel pro Ecclesia spirituali': apud Davidem, 	Sicut sagittae in manu potentis, ita filii pueritiarum; beati quisque qui implevit pharetram suam ex

<p>`pharetra' pro doctrina boni et veri: (m)apud Habakkuk, 	Sol, luna, stetit sede sua, ad lucem sagittarum tuarum ibunt, ad splendorem fulguris hastae, iii 11:(n) quod Joash 
rex Israelis ex jussu Elishae jaculatus sit sagittam arcus trans fenestram, dicente tunc Elisha, 	Sagitta salutis Jehovae, sagitta salutis Jehovae in Syrum, 2 Reg. xiii 16-18, [4]	significat arcana 
de doctrina boni et veri.  Sicut pleraque in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum habent, ita quoque `jacula, tela, sagittae, arcus, jaculator,' et significant falsa, doctrinam falsi, et illos qui in falso 
sunt, ut apud Mosen, 	Filius fecundae Josephus, filius fecundae juxta fontem filiarum, incedit super murum, et amaritudine affecerunt cum, et jaculati sunt; et oderunt eum sagittarii, Gen. xlix 	22,
