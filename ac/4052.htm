<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4052.</strong>此外，脑与大人的对应关系是这样：那些其最初意图指向良善的人与脑中那些系初始物、被称作腺体或皮质的部分相关系；而那些其最初意图指向真理的人则与脑中那些从这些初始物发出、被称作纤维的部分相关联。然而，不同之处在于：与右侧脑相对应的，是那些处于对良善的意愿，并由此处于对真理的意愿之人；而与左侧脑相对应的，则是那些处于对良善与真理的理解，并由此处于对它们的情感之人。这是因为在天上，那些在主右手边的人所行的良善源于意愿；而那些在主左手边的人所行的良善则源于理解或认知。前者就是那些所谓的属天之人，后者则是那些所谓的属灵之人。</p>

Moreover, such is the correspondence of the brain with the Grand Man, that they who are in the first principles or beginnings of good have relation to those things in the brain which are the beginnings, 
and are called the glands or cortical substances; whereas they who are in the first principles of truth relate to those things in the brains that flow out from these beginnings, and are called fibers; 
and yet with this difference-that those who correspond to the right side of the brain are those who are in the will of good and thereby in the will of truth; whereas those who correspond to the left 
side of the brain are those who are in the understanding of good and truth and thereby in the affection of them. This is because those in heaven who are at the Lord's right hand are those who are 
in good from the will; whereas those who are at His left hand are those who are in good from the understanding. The former are those who are called the celestial; and the latter those who are called the 
spiritual. </p>

Furthermore such is the correspondence of the brain with the Grand Man that those whose first intentions are directed to what is good correlate with those parts in the brain which are the first beginnings 
there and are called the glands or cortical substances. But those whose first intentions are directed to what is true correlate with those parts in the brains which emanate from those first beginnings 
and are called fibres. But the following distinction has to be made - those who correspond to the right side of the brain are those with whom the will for what is good and so for what is true predominates, 
whereas those who correspond to the left side of the brain are those with whom the understanding of what is good and true and so the affection for such predominates. The reason for this is 
that the good done by those in heaven who are on the Lord's right springs from the will, but the good done by those on the Lord's left springs from the understanding. The former are the ones who are 
called celestial, but the latter the ones who are called spiritual. </p>

Praeterea talis est correspondentia cerebri eum Maximo Homine quod qui in principiis boni sunt, referant illa in cerebro quae principia ibi sunt et vocantur glandulae seu substantiae corticales; at 
qui in principiis veri sunt, referant illa in {1}cerebris quae a principiis illis effluunt et vocantur fibrae; at usque eum hoc discrimine quod qui correspondent dextrae parti cerebri, sint qui in voluntate 
boni {2}sunt, et inde in voluntate veri; at qui correspondent sinistrae parti cerebri, sint qui in intellectu boni et veri et inde in affectione eorum; hoc inde est quia illi qui in caelo sunt 
ad dextrum Domini, sunt qui in bono ex voluntate, at qui ad sinistrum Domini, sunt qui in bono ex intellectu; illi sunt qui caelestes vocantur, hi autem qui spirituales. @1 cerebro$ @2 after veri$ </p>
