<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1324节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1324.</strong>“耶和华使他们从那里分散在全地面上”表他们得不到认可。这从第4节清楚可知，同样的话也出现在那里。“他们就停工不造那城了”表这样的教义不被接受。这从“城”的含义清楚看出来，“城”是指教义（<a href="402.htm">402</a>节）；还可从第4，5节有关“建造一座城和一座塔”的论述看出来。由此明显可知，这种内含我欲或自我崇拜的教义或敬拜是这个古教会所不允许的。至于原因，将在下一节予以揭晓。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1324.</strong> The meaning of Jehovah scattered them over the face of the whole earth as the fact that they were not acknowledged can be seen from statements above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_4" target=_top>4</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1308" target=_top>1308-1309</a>], where the same words occur.<br />[2] The meaning of they stopped building the city as the fact that doctrine of this kind was not accepted can be seen from the symbolism of a city as doctrine — demonstrated earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_402" target=_top>402</a> — and from remarks above at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_4-5" target=_top>4-5</a> about the building of the city and tower [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1302" target=_top>1302-1313</a>].<br />These remarks show that such a doctrine (or such worship), holding self-love (self-worship) deep inside it, was not allowed in this ancient church,{*1} for the reason given in the next verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1327" target=_top>1327</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "This ancient church" is the first of three mentioned by Swedenborg in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1279" target=_top>1279-1282</a>.

And Jehovah scattered them upon the faces of all the earth. That this signifies that they were not acknowledged, is evident from what was said before (at verse 4), where the same words occur. "And they 
left off to build the city"-that this signifies that such doctrine was not received, is evident from the signification of a "city," as being doctrine (as was shown above, n. 402); and from what was 
said at verses 4 and 5 concerning the building of a city and a tower. From all this it is evident that such doctrine, or such worship, wherein interiorly there is the love of self, or the worship of 
self, was not permitted to this Ancient Church, and this for the reason explained in the verse that next follows. </p>

That 'Jehovah scattered them over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the whole earth' means that they were not acknowledged is clear from what has been stated already at verse 4 where the same words occur.

That 'they left off building the city' means that such doctrine was not received is clear from the meaning of 'a city' as doctrine, as shown already in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, and also from what has been stated 
above at verses 4, 5, about building a city and a tower These considerations show that such doctrine or worship which inwardly contains love of self, that is, worship of self, was not allowed with 
this Ancient Church, and the reason is given in the very next verse </p>

</p><b>1324.</b>
Quod 'dispersit Jehovah eos super facies totius terrae' significet quod non agniti fuerint, constat ab illis quae prius ad vers. 4 dicta sunt, ubi eadem verba. 	Quod 'cessarunt aedificare urbem' significet 
quod talis doctrina non recepta, constat ex significatione 'urbis' quod sit doctrina, ut ostensum prius n. 402, tum ex illis quae supra ad vers. 4 et 5, de aedificare urbem et turrim.  Ex his 
patet quod talis doctrina seu talis cultus in quo interius amor sui seu cultus sui, apud Antiquam hanc Ecclesiam non permissus, et quidem ex causa de qua in versu mox sequente. </p>
