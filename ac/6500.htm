<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6500节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6500.</strong>“为他哀哭”表悲伤。这是显而易见的，无需解释。此处“哀哭”在内在意义上所表示的悲伤并非如外在意义所暗示的那样，是因为死亡，乃因属灵教会的良善不能被提升到属世层之上。事实上，主通过内在不断流入，想使这良善变得更完美，并把它更近地拉向祂自己；但尽管如此，这良善仍旧无法被提升到属于属天教会的良善的最初层级（<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>节）。这是因为相对属于属天教会的人来说，属灵教会的成员居于模糊之中；他会推理真理，以证实它们是不是真理；或去证实所谓的教义，他所进行的这种活动对他所证实的东西是真是假没有任何觉知。一旦为自己证实了某种东西，他就会完全相信它是真的，哪怕它是假的。事实上，没有什么东西是不能被证实的，因为这种活动是灵巧的作为，不是聪明的作为，更不是智慧的作为。虚假比真理更容易被证实，因为虚假助长恶欲，与感觉幻觉一致。这就是属灵教会成员的性质，所以他不可能被提升到属世层之上。这才是约瑟“为他哀哭”所表示的悲伤的根源。</p>

And wept upon him. That this signifies sorrow, is evident without explication. By the sorrow here signified by "weeping" is not meant in the internal sense sorrow for death as it is in the external, 
but for the good of the spiritual church, that it cannot be elevated above what is natural; for the Lord flowing in through the internal continually wills to perfect this good, and to draw it toward Himself, 
but still it cannot be elevated to the first degree of the good that belongs to the celestial church. For the man of the spiritual church is comparatively in obscurity, and reasons about truths 
as to whether they are truths, or confirms what is called doctrine, and this without perception whether what he confirms is true or not; and when he has confirmed it with himself, he fully believes 
that it is true, even though it is false; for there is nothing that cannot be confirmed, this being the work of ingenuity, not of intelligence, still less of wisdom; and what is false may be confirmed 
more readily than what is true, because it favors the cupidities, and agrees with the fallacies of the senses. Such being the nature of the man of the spiritual church, he cannot possibly be elevated 
above what is natural; and this is the source of the sorrow which is signified by "Joseph wept upon him." </p>

'And wept on him' means sorrow. This is clear without explanation. The sorrow meant in the internal sense here by 'weeping' is not because of death, as the external sense implies, but sorrow because 
the good of the spiritual Church is not able to be raised above the natural. For the Lord, who is flowing in constantly by way of the internal, wishes to make that good more perfect and draw it closer 
to Himself; but in spite of this that good cannot be raised to the prime degree of good, which is that of the celestial Church, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>. This is because the member of sorrow the spiritual Church dwells 
in obscurity, compared with one who belongs to the celestial Church. He engages in reasoning about truths to establish whether they are truths; or he goes about substantiating what is called doctrine, 
an activity he engages in without any perception of whether what he substantiates is true or not. And once he has substantiated something for himself he fully believes it to be true, even though it may 
be false. For nothing is incapable of being substantiated, since that kind of activity is the work of cleverness, not of intelligence, let alone wisdom. Falsity can be substantiated more readily than 
truth, because it encourages evil desires and accords with the illusions of the senses. Since the member of the spiritual Church is like this he cannot possibly be raised above the natural. This then 
is the reason for the sorrow meant by 'Joseph wept on him'. </p>

`Et flevit super illo':  quod significet maestitiam, constat absque explicatione.  Per maestitiam, quae hi significatur per `flere', non intelligitur maestitia propter mortem in sensu interno sicut 
in externo, sed propter bonum Ecclesiae spiritualis, quod non possit elevari supra naturale; Dominus enim influens per internum continue vult perficere illud bonum et adducere versus Se, sed usque non 
potest ad primum gradum boni quod est Ecclesiae caelestis, elevari, {1}n. 3833; nam homo Ecclesiae spiritualis in obscuro est respective, et ratiocinatur de veris num vera sint, aut confirmat illa {2}quae 
doctrina dicta, et hoc absque perceptione num verum sit vel non verum quod confirmat, et cum confirmaverat illud apud se, credit {3}prorsus quod verum sit, tametsi foret falsum, nam nihil non confirmari 
potest, hoc enim ingenii opus est, non intelligentiae, minus sapientiae, et falsum confirmari potest prae vero, quia favet cupiditatibus, et congruit fallaciis sensuum. Quia homo Ecclesiae spiritualis 
(t)est talis, nequaquam elevari potest supra naturale; inde nunc maestitia quae per `flevit Josephus super illo' significatur. @1 A d$ @2 quia ita doctrina dicit$ @3 quod ita sit, tametsi 
non ita est$ </p>
