<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8099节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8099.</strong>“红海”表他们首先不得不经历的诅咒。这从“红海”的含义清楚可知，“红海”是指那些陷入与仁分离之信，并过着邪恶生活的人所在的地狱；“红海”因表示地狱，故也表示诅咒。至于他们首先不得不经历诅咒，情况是这样：当那些属于属灵教会，在主降临之前一直滞留在低地，在那里被陷入与仁分离之信的人侵扰的人（他们是前几章论述的主题）被释放时，他们不是立刻被提上天堂，而是首先被带入洁净的第二个状态，也就是试探的状态。因为没有试探，信之真理和良善既无法被确认或坚定接受，也无法结合；在这些被确认或坚定接受并结合之前，这些人无法被提入天堂。以色列人不是立刻被领进迦南地，而是首先被领进旷野，在那里逗留了四十年，在此期间经历摩西五经中所描述的各种试探就代表这些事。<br />关于这个事实，即他们首先穿过红海，红海表示那些陷入分离之信并过着邪恶生活的人所在的地狱，因而首先从诅咒的中间穿过，要知道：这个地狱在前方奸淫者的地狱下面的深处，向左侧广为延伸，通过像海水那样的水与奸淫者的地狱分离。那里的右边，但更深处是那些处于信之真理，但未处于信之良善的人聚集的地方，这些人由刚才（<a href="8096.htm">8096</a>节）所提到的“非利士人”来表示。但低地，就是那些正遭受侵扰的人所在的区域在脚底下面，稍向前一点。那些从侵扰中被释放的人不会被带到右边，因为“非利士人”所表示的那些人在这里。相反，他们被带到左边，从前面所提到的地狱中间穿过；他们出现在左边，那里有一个旷野。我有两次被允许看见那些正从侵扰中获救的人经过这条路。当他们经过时，主如此保护他们，以至于根本没有任何祸事能触及他们，更不用说任何诅咒了。因为他们被与主同在的天使的柱子包围。<br />这一切由以色列人穿越红海来代表。这一切还由以赛亚书中的这些话来表示：<br />耶和华的膀臂啊，醒来，醒来!使海与大深渊的水干涸、使海的深处变为赎民经过之路的，不是你吗？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.9.htm">51:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“耶和华的膀臂”是指主的神性人身；“大深渊的水”和“海的深处”是指那些陷入与仁分离之人，过着邪恶生活的人所在的地狱；在他们所生活的下面像海水那样的水是指虚假，因为在来世，虚假看似密集的乌云，以及水的泛滥（<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="4423.htm">4423</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>节）；“经过的赎民”是指那些被主释放的人。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华想起古时的日子、摩西和祂百姓说，将他们和牧养祂羊群的人从海里领上来的在哪里呢？将祂的圣灵降在他们中间的在哪里呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.11.htm">63:11</a>）<br />在这段预言中，“摩西”表示主，祂也是“牧养羊群的人”；“从海里领上来的百姓”是指那些从诅咒中被释放的人。耶利米书：<br />因他们仆倒的声音，地就震动。在红海那里必听见呼喊的声音。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.21.htm">49:21</a>）<br />“红海”表示地狱，因为此处论述的主题是以东及其诅咒。经上说“在红海那里必听见呼喊的声音”，而事实上，淹死在红海的，不是他们，而是埃及人；由此明显可知“红海”表示地狱和诅咒。“以东”在此表示那些出于自我之爱的邪恶弃绝教义真理，信奉虚假的人（<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>节）。由此可见“红海”在内在代表意义上表示什么，以及下一章所描述的事件，即以色列人穿越红海，以及埃及人淹死在红海中表示什么。</p>

The sea Suph. That this signifies the damnation which they were first to pass through, is evident from the signification of "the sea Suph," as being the hell where are those who are in faith separate 
from charity, and in a life of evil; and as "the sea Suph" denotes hell, it also denotes damnation. In regard to their having first to pass through damnation, the case is this. When those who had been 
of the spiritual church, and until the coming of the Lord had been detained in the lower earth, and there infested by those who had been in faith separate from charity (who have been treated of in the 
preceding chapters), were liberated, they were not at once taken up into heaven, but were first brought into a second state of purification, which is that of temptations; for the truths and goods of 
faith can neither be confirmed nor conjoined without temptations, and until these had been confirmed and conjoined, they could not be raised into heaven. These things were represented by the sons of 
Israel not being at once introduced into the land of Canaan, but being first led into the wilderness, where they remained forty years, and in the meantime underwent various temptations which are described 
in the books of Moses.  [2] As regards the fact that they first passed through the sea Suph, by which is signified the hell of those who are in faith separate and in a life of evil, thus through 
the midst of damnation, be it known that this hell is in front deep down beneath the hells of adulterers, and spreads rather widely toward the left, being separated from the hells of adulterers by waters 
as of a sea. To the right there, but deeper, is where those are gathered together who are in the truth of faith, but not in the good of faith, who are signified by the "Philistines" (of whom just 
above, n. 8096); but the lower earth where those are who are being infested, is beneath the sole of the foot, a little in front. They who are liberated from infestations are not brought toward the right, 
for here are those who are signified by the "Philistines;" but they are brought to the left, through the midst of the hell above spoken of, and they emerge to the left, where there is as it were 
a wilderness. I have twice been allowed to see that those who are being delivered from infestations pass by this way. While they are passing through, they are so protected by the Lord that not the slightest 
evil can touch them, still less anything of damnation, for they are encompassed with a column of angels, with whom the Lord is present: this was represented by the passage of the sons of Israel 
through the sea Suph.  [3] This was also meant by these words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah. . . . Art Thou not it that dried up the sea, the waters of the great 
deep? that hath set the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over? (Isa. 51:9, 10);  the "arm of Jehovah" denotes the Lord as to the Divine Human; "the waters of the great deep," and "the 
depths of the sea," denote the hell where are those who are in faith separate from charity and in a life of evil; the waters as of a sea beneath which they are, are falsities, for in the other life falsities 
are seen as dense and dark clouds, and also as inundations of water (n. 739, 4423, 7307); "the redeemed who were to pass over" denote those who have been liberated by the Lord.  [4] In the same: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah hath remembered the days of old, Moses and His people, saying, where is He that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? where is He that put the spirit of His 
holiness in the midst of them? (Isa. 43:11). In this prophetic utterance by Moses is meant the Lord, who also is "the shepherd of the flock;" by "the people whom He brought up out of the sea," are meant 
those who were liberated from damnation.  [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The earth trembled at the voice of their fall; there was a cry, the voice thereof was heard in the sea Suph (Jer. 49:21); </p>
<p>"the sea 
Suph" denotes hell, for Edom and its damnation are here treated of, and it is said that "the voice thereof was heard from the sea Suph," when yet not they, but the Egyptians were immersed in that sea, 
which shows that "the sea Suph" signifies hell and damnation. By "Edom" are here signified those who from the evil of the love of self reject the truths of doctrine, and embrace falsities (n. 3322). 
From all this it can now be seen what is signified by "the sea Suph" in the internal representative sense, and what by the passage through it of the sons of Israel, and by the immersion of the Egyptians 
therein, as described in the following chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8099</b></p><p><b>8099.</b>
'The Sea Suph' means the damnation which they first had to pass through. This is clear from the meaning of 'the Sea Suph' as the hell where those spirits are who are governed by faith separated from 
charity and lead a life of evil; and since 'the Sea Suph' means hell it also means damnation. The reason why they first had to pass through damnation is this: There were people belonging to the spiritual 
Church who were held back on the lower earth until the Lord's Coming, where they were molested by those governed by faith separated from charity. These have been the subject in the preceding chapters. 
When those people were delivered from that place they were not raised to heaven immediately. Before this they were led into a second state - a state of purification, which is a state of temptations. 
For truths and forms of the good of faith can be neither firmly accepted nor bonded together without temptations; and until these had been firmly accepted and bonded together those people could not 
be raised into heaven. These things were represented by the children of Israel, by their not being led straightaway into the land of Canaan but living first in the wilderness, where they remained for 
forty years, undergoing various temptations, which are described in the books of Moses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In regard to this matter, that they first passed through the Sea Suph, which means the hell of those who 
are governed by separated faith and lead an evil life, thus that they first passed through the middle of damnation, it should be recognized that this hell is situated deep down out in front beneath 
the adulterers' hells, stretching rather widely towards the left. It is separated from the adulterers' hells by waters like those of the sea On the right there, but higher up, is the place where those 
governed by the truth of faith but not by the good of faith are gathered - those meant by 'the Philistines', who are referred to just above in <a href="8096.htm">8096</a>. But the lower earth, the region where those who suffer 
molestation are, is beneath the soles of the feet, slightly out in front. Those who are delivered from molestation are not led towards the right since the ones meant by the Philistines are there. 
Instead they are led towards the left, through the midst of the hell that has been mentioned and they come out on the left, where there is a kind of wilderness. I have been allowed on two occasions to 
see that this is the way which they pass through when rescued from molestations. As they pass through they are protected by the Lord in such a way that nothing bad at all can touch them, let alone any 
damnation. For they are encompassed by a pillar of angels with whom the Lord is present. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is represented by the passage of the children of Israel through the Sea Suph. Such was also meant by 
the following in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah. Were You not that which dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, which made the deep places of the sea a road, in 
order that the redeemed might pass through? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:9,10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:9,10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The arm of Jehovah' is the Lord's Divine Human. 'The waters of the great deep' and 'the depths of the sea' are the hell in which those live 
who are governed by faith separated from charity and lead a life of evil. The waters like those of the sea beneath which they live are falsities; for in the next life falsities appear as thick, dark 
clouds, and also as deluges of water, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="4423.htm">4423</a>, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>. The redeemed who were to pass through them are those whom the Lord has delivered. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah remembered the days of 
old, Moses, [and] His people, [saying,] Where is He who caused them to come up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put the spirit of His holiness in the midst of them? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In this prophetic utterance 'Moses' is used to mean the Lord, who is also 'the shepherd of the flock'. 'The people whom He caused to come up out of the sea' are those who were delivered from 
damnation. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
At the noise of their fall the earth shook; [as for their] cry, the noise of it was heard in the Sea Suph. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Sea Suph' stands for hell, for Edom and its damnation 
is the subject there. It says that the noise of it was heard coming out of the Sea Suph, when yet they were not the ones who were drowned in that sea but the Egyptians. From this it is evident 
that 'the Sea Suph' means hell and damnation 'Edom' there means those who are led by the evil of self-love to reject the truths taught by doctrine and to embrace falsities, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>. </p>
<p>From all this one 
may now see what is meant in the representative internal sense by 'the sea Suph', and what is meant by the passage through it of the children of Israel and the drowning in it of the Egyptians, events 
described in the next chapter. </p>

`Mare Suph': quod significet damnationem quam primum transirent, constat ex significatione `maris Suph' quod sit infernum ubi illi qui in fide separata a charitate, inque vita mali; et quia `mare Suph' 
est infernum, est quoque damnatio.  Cum hoc quod primum transirent damnationem, ita se habet: illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali fuerunt, et usque ad Adventum Domini detenti in terra inferiore, ac ibi 
infestati ab illis qui in fide separata a charitate fuerunt, de quibus in capitibus quae praecedunt actum est, cum inde liberati sunt, {1} non immediate in caelum sunt sublati, sed prius in alterum 
statum purificationis, qui est tentationum, perducti sunt; nam vera et bona fidei nec confirmari nec conjungi possunt absque tentationibus, et antequam illa confirmata sunt et conjuncta, non elevari in 
caelum potuerunt; haec repraesentata sunt per filios Israelis, quod non statim introducti sint in terram Canaanem, sed prius in desertum ubi per quadraginta annos permanserunt, ac interea varias tentationes 
{2}subiverunt, de quibus in Libris Moschis. 	2 Quod id attinet, quod primum per {3}mare Suph, per quod significatur infernum illorum qui in fide separata ac vita mali {4}, {5}transiverint, ita 
per mediam damnationem, sciendum quod infernum hoc {6}sit antrorsum profunde sub infernis adulterorum, et {7}extendat se satis late versus sinistrum; (m)separatur ab {8}infernis adulterorum per aquas 
quasi maris;(n) ad dextrum ibi, {9}sed altius, est ubi congregantur illi qui in fidei vero sed non in fidei bono (d)sunt, qui per `Philistaeos' significantur, de quibus mox supra n. (x)8096; terra 
autem inferior ubi sunt qui infestantur, est sub planta pedis, paulisper antrorsum; qui ab infestationibus liberantur, illi non perducuntur versus dextrum, nam ibi sunt illi qui significantur per `Philistaeos,' 
{10}sed perducuntur ad sinistrum, per medium infernum, de quo dictum est, ac emergunt ad sinistrum, ubi quasi desertum; quod per hanc viam transeant illi qui ab infestationibus eximuntur, bis 
mihi videre datum est; {11}cum transeunt, tutantur ita a Domino ut ne hilum mali, minus aliquid damnationis illos attingat, circumcincti enim sunt columna angelorum apud quos (t)est Dominus praesens; 
hoc repraesentatum 3 est per transitum filiorum Israelis per mare Suph; hoc quoque intellectum est per haec apud Esaiam, Expergiscere, expergiscere, indue robur, brachium Jehovae; nonne Tu illud quod 
exsiccavit mare, aquas abyssi magnae, quod posuit profunditates maris viam, ut transirent redempti? li 9, 10; </p>
<p>`brachium Jehovae' est Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum; `aquae abyssi magnae et profunditates 
maris' sunt infernum ubi illi qui in fide separata a charitate ac in vita mali; `aquae sicut maris, sub quibus sunt' sunt falsa, nam falsa in altera vita apparent sicut densae et obscurae nubes, 
et quoque sicut inundationes aquarum, n. 739, 4423, 7307; `redempti qui transirent' sunt qui a Domino liberati sunt: apud eundem, 4 Jehovah recordatus est dierum antiquitatis, Moschis, populi Ipsius: 
Ubi qui ascendere fecit eos e mari, cum pastore gregis sui? ubi qui posuit in medio illius spiritum sanctitatis suae? lxiii 11; </p>
<p>in prophetico hoc per `Moschen' intelligitur Dominus, Qui etiam est 
`pastor gregis'; per `populum quem ascendere fecit ex mari' illi qui liberati e damnatione {12}: apud Jeremiam, 5 A voce casus eorum contremuit terra; clamorem, in mari Suph audita est vox {13}illius,

inde patet quod `mare Suph' significet infernum ac damnationem; per `Edomum' ibi significantur qui ex malo amoris sui rejiciunt vera doctrinae, et {15}amplectuntur falsa, n. 3322.  Ex his nunc constare 
potest quid per `mare Suph' in sensu interno repraesentativo significatur, et quid per `transitum filiorum Israelis,' ac per `immersionem Aegyptiorum ibi,' de quibus in capite sequente. 	@1 i tunc$ 	@2
