<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8237节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8237.</strong>“以色列看见埃及人死在海岸上”表看见受到诅咒者被分散到四处。这从“看见”、“死”和“在海岸上”的含义，以及“埃及人”的代表清楚可知：“看见”是指看见或看到；“埃及人”是指那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人；“死”是指受到诅咒（参看<a href="5407.htm">5407</a>，<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>，<a href="7494.htm">7494</a>节）；“在海岸上”是指在围绕地狱最外面部分的区域。“海岸”明显是指最外面部分；“海”表示地狱，这在前面早已说明。正因如此，“看见埃及人死在海岸上”表示看见受到诅咒者被分散到四处。<br />既然提到了看见受到诅咒者这个词语，就必须解释一下此中是何情形。任何一个地狱的居民都不会被另外任何一个地狱的居民看见，甚至不会被最近或紧挨着的地狱居民看见，因为他们完全彼此分开。但每当主乐意时，天堂里的人却能看见他们。因为主通过天使也掌管地狱，天使被赋予能力从他们所在的地方看见那里所发生的一切事。这样做的目的是为了地狱也有秩序存在，还为了这一个向那一个所施的暴力不超出所允许的限度。这项职责或功能被赋予天使，他们通过它掌控地狱。有时善灵也被允许观看地狱，见证那里正在发生的事；因为从高层事物看见低层事物完全符合秩序，但从低层事物看见高层事物不符合秩序。因此，地狱及其居民能被天堂里的人看见，反过来不行。正因如此，从良善能看见邪恶，但从邪恶不能看见良善，因为良善是高的，邪恶是低的。</p>

And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore. That this signifies the view of the damned scattered here and there, is evident from the signification of "to see," as being to look at, or the view; 
from the representation of "the Egyptians," as being those who are in falsities from evil; from the signification of "dead," as being damned (see n. 5407, 6119, 7494); and from the signification of 
"upon the seashore," as being in the region which surrounds the utmost parts of hell; that "shores" denote the utmost parts is evident; and that "the sea" denotes hell has been already shown. Hence 
it is that by "seeing them dead upon the sea shore" is signified the view of the damned scattered here and there. As the view of the damned is mentioned, it must be made clear how the case herein is. 
They who are in hells are not seen by those who are in another hell, not even by those who are in the next or nearest, for they are completely separated; but they appear to those who are in heaven whenever 
the Lord pleases. For the Lord rules the hells also by means of angels, to whom an opportunity is given of seeing all things that come forth there, from the place where they are. This is done to 
the end that there may be order in hell also, and that one may not do violence to another beyond what is permitted. This office is given to the angels, and through it there is rule over the hells. To 
look into the hells and to see what is going on there, is also sometimes granted to good spirits, for it is from order that lower things can be seen from higher, but not higher things from lower. Thus 
the hells and their inhabitants can be seen by those who are in heaven, but not the reverse. Hence it is that evils can be seen from good, but not goods from evil, for good is higher and evil is lower. </p>

'And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore' means the sight of the damned dispersed this way and that. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as the sight or catching sight of something; 
from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as those steeped in falsities arising from evil; from the meaning of 'the dead' as the damned, dealt with in <a href="5407.htm">5407</a>, <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, <a href="7494.htm">7494</a>; and from the meaning of 'the seashore' 
as round about the outermost parts of hell. 'The shores' of something are plainly its outermost parts; and it has been shown previously that 'the sea' means hell. So it is that 'seeing them dead 
on the seashore' means the sight of the damned dispersed this way and that. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the expression 'the sight of the damned' is used some explanation of what is implied by it is called for. Those 
in any one hell are not visible to the inhabitants of any other hell, not even to those in the nearest or immediately neighbouring hell, since they have been completely separated from one another. 
But they are visible to those in heaven, as often as the Lord pleases; for the Lord rules the hells too, by means of angels to whom the ability is given to see, from the place where they are, everything 
happening there. This is done to the end that in hell too order may exist, and also to the end that no one may do violence to another beyond the permitted limit. This function is entrusted to angels, 
and through it they exercise control over the hells. Sometimes good spirits as well are allowed to see into the hells and witness what is going on there; for it is quite in order for things on lower 
levels to be seen from a higher one, but not for those on a higher level to be seen from lower ones. Thus the hells and those who are there can be seen by those in heaven, but not vice versa. Consequently 
forms of evil can be seen from good, but not forms of good from evil, since good is higher and evil lower. </p>

</p><b>8237.</b>
`Et vidit Israel Aegyptios mortuos in litore maris': quod significet aspectum damnatorum hinc inde dispersorum, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit aspicere seu aspectus; ex repraesentatione 
`Aegyptiorum' quod sint qui in falsis a malo; ex significatione `mortuorum' quod sint damnati, de qua n. 5407, 6119, 7494; et ex significatione `in litore maris' quod sit circa extrema inferni; quod 
`litora' sint extrema, patet, et quod `mare' {1} sit infernum, prius ostensum est; inde est quod per `videre illos mortuos in litore maris' significetur aspectus damnatorum hinc inde dispersorum. 	2 
Quia aspectus damnatorum {2} dicitur, illustrandum est quomodo cum hoc se habet: qui in infernis sunt non apparent illis qui in alio inferno sunt, ne quidem illis qui in proximo seu vicinissimo, nam prorsus 
separati sunt, sed apparent illis qui in caelo, quoties id Domino beneplacet; Dominus enim regit inferna etiam per angelos quibus datur copia e loco ubi sunt videndi omnia quae ibi existunt; hoc 
fit ex causa ut ibi quoque ordo sit, et ne unus alteri violentiam inferat ultra quam permittitur; hoc munus angelis datur, et per id dominium super inferna; inspicere in inferna et videre ibi quae fiunt, 
etiam aliquoties datur bonis spiritibus, nam ex ordine est quod e superiore videri queant inferiora, non autem ab inferioribus superiora; ita ab illis qui in caelo sunt, videri possunt inferna et 
illi qui ibi, non autem vicissim; (m)inde est quod ex bono videri queant mala, non autem ex malo bona, nam bonum superius est et malum inferius.(n) 	@1 i hic$ 	@2 i hinc inde dispersorum$ </p>
