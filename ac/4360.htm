<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4360节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4360.</strong>“于是两个使女和她们的孩子前来下拜”表感官记忆知识及其真理，并它们的顺服。这从“使女”、“孩子”或“儿子”和“下拜”的含义清楚可知：“使女”是指对记忆知识和属于外在人的认知的情感，如前所述（<a href="4344.htm">4344</a>节），因而是指感官记忆知识，其性质下文予以讨论；“孩子”或“儿子”是指真理（参看<a href="4357.htm">4357</a>节）；“下拜”是指顺服。“使女”所表示的感官记忆知识是指对尘世外在事物的记忆知识，因而是指一切知识中最为总体的（<a href="4345.htm">4345</a>节），以及直接通过外在感官进入，并被感官本身所觉知的知识。人在童年早期所拥有的知识就是感官知识，这类知识不仅能为内在性质事物的认知，而且还能为后来属灵事物的认知充当一个基础。因为属灵事物建立在属世事物之上，并在它们里面表现出来。由于真理照着始于更为总体事物的次序而与良善结合，如前所示（<a href="4345.htm">4345</a>节），此处经上提到使女和她们的孩子首先下拜，也就是顺服。</p>

And the handmaids drew near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. That this signifies sensuous knowledges and their truths, and their submission, is evident from the signification of "handmaids," 
as being the affections of memory-knowledges and of the knowledges which are of the external man (see above n. 4344), consequently sensuous memory-knowledges (of which below); from the signification 
of "children" or "sons," as being truths (see n. 4357); and from the signification of "bowing one's self," as being submission. The sensuous memory-knowledges signified by the "handmaids" are 
the memory-knowledges of the external things of the world, and therefore are the most general of all knowledges (n. 4345), and are those which enter immediately through the external senses, and are 
perceived by the sense itself. In these are all little children; and moreover they serve as planes to the knowledges of spiritual things, for spiritual things are founded upon natural, and are represented 
in them. As truths are conjoined with good according to order, beginning with the more general (as shown above, n. 4345), therefore it is here mentioned that the handmaids and their children bowed 
themselves, that is, submitted, first. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4360</b></p><p><b>4360.</b>
'And the servant-girls came near, they and their sons, and bowed down' means sensory knowledge and its truths, and their submission. This is clear from the meaning of 'the servant-girls' as affections 
for knowledge and for cognitions which belong to the external man, dealt with above in <a href="4344.htm">4344</a>, and therefore sensory knowledge, the nature of which is discussed below; from the meaning of 'sons' as truths, 
dealt with above in <a href="4357.htm">4357</a>; and from the meaning of 'bowing down' as submission. Sensory knowledge, meant by 'the servant-girls', is factual knowledge about external things which belong to the world, 
and is therefore the most general kind of all, <a href="4345.htm">4345</a>. It consists in the things which enter immediately through the external senses and which are perceived by that sensory awareness. The knowledge 
which everyone possesses in early childhood is sensory knowledge, and this serves as a basis not only for cognitions of interior natural things but also later on for cognitions of spiritual things. For 
spiritual things are founded on natural ones and are represented within them. It is because truths are joined to good in conformity with an ordering that begins with things that are quite general, as 
shown above in <a href="4345.htm">4345</a>, that the reference is made at this point to the servant-girls and their sons bowing down first, that is, they were submissive. </p>

</p><b>4360.</b>
`Et appropinquaverunt ancillae, illae et nati illarum, et incurvaverunt se': quod significet scientifica sensualia et illorum vera, et eorum submissionem, constat ex significatione `ancillarum' quod 
sint affectiones scientiarum et cognitionum quae externi hominis, de qua supra n. 4344, proinde scientifica sensualia, de quibus sequitur; ex significatione `natorum' seu filiorum quod sint vera, 
de qua supra n. 4357; et ex significatione `incurvare se' quod sit submissio. Scientifica sensualia quae significantur per `ancillas,' sunt scientifica rerum externarum quae mundi, et inde omnium 
{1} communissima, n. 4345, suntque illa quae per sensus externos immediate intrant et ipso sensu percipiuntur; in illis sunt omnes infantiae, ac inserviunt pro planis non modo cognitionibus rerum 
[naturalium interiorum sed etiam dein cognitionibus rerum] spiritualium; res enim spirituales fundantur super naturalibus, et in his repraesentantur.  Quia vera conjunguntur bono secundum ordinem 
a communioribus, ut supra n. (x)4345 ostensum, ideo hic memoratur quod `ancillae et earum nati primum se incurvaverint,' hoc est, se submiserint.      @1 quae$ </p>
