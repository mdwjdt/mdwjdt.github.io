<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第143节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>143.</strong>对于“牲畜”和“活物”在古时系指人的情感之类，这在今日可能显得十分奇怪。但古时之人拥有属天的观念，在精灵界，人的情感显现为相应的活物，故当他们说活物时，指的其实是情感。当圣经提到牲畜时，不管是笼统的还是具体的，指的也是情感。这种提法在先知书中很多，人若不了解每样牲畜的象征，就不可能理解圣经的内义。如前面所说，牲畜分两类，一为恶的，亦即有害的，一为善的，亦即驯良的。后者象征良善的情感，比如绵羊、羔羊、鸽子。此处论述的是属天之人，或属天属灵之人，故它所指的是良善的情感。对于“牲畜”象征情感，这从前面所引的经文可以得到证明（<a href="45.htm">45</a>-<a href="46.htm">46</a>节），此处无需赘述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]143.</strong> These days it may seem strange that in ancient times animals and beasts symbolized feelings and similar human qualities. But [in the first place] people then viewed things the way heaven does, and [in the second place] animals represent these qualities in the world of spirits as well. (In fact a quality is represented by an animal whose nature reflects that quality.) In consequence, when the ancients mentioned the animals they meant nothing else than the qualities.<br />In the Word, too, no other meaning is intended in any passage that mentions animals in general or in particular. The whole of the prophetic portion is full of these references. Not knowing what each species of animal symbolizes makes it impossible to understand what the Word contains in its inner meaning.<br />As noted above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>], animals are of two kinds: bad (because they are dangerous) and good (because they are harmless). The good ones, such as sheep, lambs, and doves, symbolize positive emotions. Here, where the heavenly person (or the heavenly kind of spiritual person) is the subject, that is their symbolism.<br />Sections 45, 46 quoted several places in the Word that show that animals in general symbolize feelings, eliminating the need for further demonstration here. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 143</b></p><p><b>143.</b>
That by "beasts" and "animals" were anciently signified affections and like things in man, may appear strange at the present day; but as the men of those times were in a celestial idea, and as such things 
are represented in the world of spirits by animals, and in fact by such animals as they are like, therefore when they spoke in that way they meant nothing else. Nor is anything else meant in the 
Word in those places where beasts are mentioned either generally or specifically. The whole prophetic Word is full of such things, and therefore one who does not know what each beast specifically signifies, 
cannot possibly understand what the Word contains in the internal sense. But, as before observed, beasts are of two kinds- evil or noxious beasts, and good or harmless ones-and by the good beasts 
are signified good affections, as for instance by sheep, lambs, and doves; and as it is the celestial, or the celestial spiritual man, who is treated of, such are here meant. That "beasts" in general 
signify affections, may be seen above, confirmed by some passages in the Word (n. 45, 46), so that there is no need of further confirmation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 143</b></p><p><b>143.</b>
Nowadays it may seem strange that 'beasts' and 'animals' in ancient times meant affections and similar things residing with man. But because people had heavenly ideas then, and because such things are 
also represented in the world of spirits by animals - by such animals in fact as resemble those affections - this alone is what they therefore understood when they spoke in this fashion. And this alone 
is what is meant in the Word whenever beasts are mentioned in general or in particular. The whole prophetical section of the Word is full of things such as these, and therefore anyone who does not 
know the particular meaning of any beast cannot possibly understand what the Word contains in the internal sense. But as slated already, there are two kinds of beasts - evil ones, because they are harmful, 
and good ones, because they are harmless. Good beasts, such as sheep, lambs, and doves, mean good affections. Here, because the subject is the celestial man, or the celestial-spiritual man, the 
same applies. The fact that 'beasts' in general means affections has been confirmed from several places in the Word quoted already in <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>. So there is no need of further confirmation.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 143</b>
</p><b>143.</b>
Quod per 'bestias et animalia' antiquitus significatae sint affectiones et similia apud hominem, hodie peregrinum apparere potest; sed quia in caelesti idea fuerunt, et talia quoque in mundo spirituum 
repraesentantur per animalia, et quidem per talia animalia quibus similia sunt, ideo non aliud intellexerunt cum ita locuti sunt: in Verbo nec alia intelliguntur ubicumque bestiae nominantur in genere 
et in specie; totum Verbum propheticum plenum est similibus, quare qui non novit quid unaquaevis bestia significat in specie, nusquam intelligere potest quid Verbum in interno sensu continet: sed, 
ut dictum prius, bestiae sunt duplicis generis, malae quia noxiae, bonae quia innoxiae; per bonas significantur affectiones bonae, sicut per 'oves, agnos, columbas'; hic quia de caelesti seu de caelesti 
spirituali homine agitur, similiter: quod 'bestiae' in genere significent affectiones, ex aliquibus locis in Verbo confirmatum videatur prius, n. 45, 46; ut non opus sit amplius confirmare.
