<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4221节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4221.</strong>为叫我知道情况的确如此，我被允许与那些以这种方式生活的人，以及我在肉身生活中所认识的人交谈。有一个人活在世上时，向邻人所行的一切良善都是为了他自己，也就是为了自己的名和利。凡不服从这些目的的人都遭到他的鄙视，甚至憎恨。诚然，他口头上承认神，但心里并不承认。当我被允许与他交谈时，他放射出一种可以说属肉体而非属灵的气场。他说的话不像是灵人说的，倒像是仍活在世上或肉体中的人说的；因为灵人所说的话不同于世人的，充满各种观念，也就是说，含有某种属灵事物、因而含有某种无法描述的活物在里面。不过，与我交谈的这个灵人不是这样。他所放射的气场，以及从他说的每句话中所感知到的，都是诸如上面所提到那种。他在来世就出现在那些极卑鄙的人之列；我被告知，这种人在思维和情感方面会逐渐变得如此粗鄙和愚蠢，以致世上都没有比他们更愚蠢的人。他们的居所在臀部下面，就是他们的地狱所在之地。这个地方以前也出现过一个人，他看上去不像灵人，倒像是粗鄙的肉体人；他里面真正为人的理性生命如此之少，以致你可将它称为愚蠢的化身。这些经历向我表明，那些没有对邻人、对自己的国家，尤其对主国度的爱，只爱自己，在一切事上都只考虑自己，甚至崇拜自己为神明，还想被其他人崇拜，并且在他们所行的每件事上都有这种意图的人会变成哪种灵人。</p>

In order that I might know that such is the case, I have been permitted to speak with those who have lived in this manner, and likewise with one with whom I had been acquainted in the life of the body. 
During this man's life on earth, all the good he had done to the neighbor had been done for the sake of himself, that is, for his own honor and gain. All who could not be made subservient to these 
ends he had despised, and even hated. He had indeed made an oral confession of God, but at heart acknowledged Him not; and when I was permitted to speak to him there exhaled from him a sphere that was 
as it were corporeal. His speech was not like that of spirits, but was like that of a mortal still in the flesh; for the speech of spirits is distinguished from that of men in being full of ideas, or 
in having within it something spiritual, thus something alive that is inexpressible; but this was not the case with this man's speech. Such was the sphere that exhaled from him and that was perceived 
in everything that he said. He appeared there among the vile; and I was told that persons of this character successively become so gross and stupid in respect to their thoughts and affections, that no 
one in this world is more so. They have their abode under the buttocks, where their hell is. From the same place there had previously appeared a certain person (not as a spirit, but as a grossly corporeal 
man, appears), in whom there was so little of the life of intelligence which is properly human, that you would call it stupidity personified. From these examples it was evident what kind of spirits 
those become who are in no love toward the neighbor, nor toward the state, and still less toward the Lord's kingdom; but who are exclusively in the love of self, and who in everything regard themselves 
alone, even adoring themselves as gods, and also desiring to be so adored by others, and having this intent in everything they do. </p>

To enable me to know that this is so I have been allowed to talk to those who have lived in this manner and also to one person whom I had even known during his lifetime. Whatever good he had done to 
the neighbour during that time he had done for selfish reasons, that is to say, for the sake of his own position and gain. The rest to whom he did not do good he treated with contempt and also hated. 
He did, it is true, confess God with the lips, but he did not acknowledge Him in his heart. When I was allowed to talk to him there emanated from him a sphere which was so to speak of a bodily and unspiritual 
nature. His speech was not like that of spirits but of people still living in this world - for the speech of spirits differs from that of men in that it is filled with ideas, that is, it incorporates 
something spiritual and so a living quality that cannot be described. But the speech of the spirit to whom I spoke was not like this. The sphere emanating from him and which was perceptible in 
every single thing he said was such as mentioned above. He was to be seen there among those who are base, and I was told that such people gradually become in their thoughts and affections so dull and 
stupid that no one on earth could be more stupid than they are. They have a place under the buttocks where their hell is situated. From there one had also appeared previously who did not look like a 
spirit but an extremely bodily-minded man in whom the life of intelligence which is truly human was so minimal that you would call it the embodiment of stupidity. These experiences showed me what kind 
of spirits those people become who have no love for their neighbour, nor any for the general public, still less any for the Lord's kingdom, but who love only themselves and consider only themselves 
in every single thing, indeed who adore themselves as gods and also wish to be so adored by others, having this intent in everything they do. </p>

Ut scirem quod ita sit, cum talibus qui ita vixerunt, loqui datum (o)est, et quoque cum uno quem etiam in vita corporis novi; </p>
<p>ille dum vixit, quicquid proximo fecit bonum, propter se fecit, nempe 
sui honoris et sui lucri causa, reliquos contempsit, et quoque odio habuit; Deum quidem confessus est ore, non tamen agnovit corde: cum loqui cum illo daretur, exhalabat ab illo sphaera sicut corporea, 
loquela ejus erat non sicut spirituum, sed sicut hominis adhuc vivi; nam loquela spirituum distinguit se ab humana in eo quod illa sit plena ideis seu quod spirituale ei insit, ita vivum quod 
non exprimi potest, haec autem non ita; talis sphaera exhalabat ab illo, et percipiebatur in singulis quae loquebatur; apparebat ibi inter viles, et dictum quod qui tales sunt, successive fiant quoad 
cogitationes et affectiones tam crassi et stupidi ut non stupidior aliquis in mundo: locum habent sub clunibus ubi infernum illorum est; inde quoque prius apparuit {1} quidam, non specie qua spiritus, 
sed specie qua homo crasse corporeus, in quo tam parum ex vita intelligentiae quae propria est humana ut dicas stupiditatem in effigie; inde patebat quales illi fiunt, qui in {2} nullo amore 
sunt erga proximum, nec erga publicum, minus erga regnum Domini, sed solum in amore sui, et se solum in singulis spectant, immo se adorant ut deos et sic quoque volunt ab aliis adorari, {3} in omnibus 
quae agunt id intendendo {4}.      @1 apparuerunt$      @2 ex$      @3 i et$      @4 intendunt$ </p>
