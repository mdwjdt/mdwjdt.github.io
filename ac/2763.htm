<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2763节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2763.</strong>由此明显可知，圣言中的代表物和具有灵义的事物源于何处，也就是说，它们源自存在于来世的代表物。临到属天的上古教会成员身上的代表物就出自这一源头，他们在世时就与灵人并天使相伴。这些代表物从他们传到其后代，最后传到那些只知道它们具有这种含义的人那里。不过，由于这些代表物从上古时代传下来，并存在于其神性敬拜中，故它们受到崇敬，并被视为神圣。<br />除了代表物外，还有对应物。它们在灵界象征和表示完全不同于它们在尘世中那样的某种事物。例如，心表对良善的情感；眼表理解力或理解力；耳表顺从；手表能力；除此之外还有其它数不清的对应物。这些事物在灵人界不是以这种方式被代表，而是以属世之物对应于属灵之物的方式相对应。正因如此，圣言中的每句话，甚至一点一划都包含属灵和属天之物；并且圣言以这种方式进行启示，即当世人阅读圣言时，灵人与天使立刻根据代表物和对应物从属灵的角度领悟它。<br />大洪水后的古人大力发展并高度重视这种学问（即对应学），他们凭它与灵人并天使一同思考。但如今，这种学问早就被人遗忘了，以至于几乎没人愿意相信它的存在。那些相信它存在的人也仅仅视其为某种无用的神秘之物。这是因为人类已变得完全世俗和肉体化，并到了一提及属灵和属天之物就反感，有时感到厌恶，甚至恶心的地步。那么，在持续到永远的来世，他们又作何反应呢？要知道，来世没有任何世俗和肉体之物，只有构成天堂生命的属灵和属天之物。</p>

From all this it is now manifest whence come the representatives and significatives in the Word, namely, from the representatives that exist in the other life. From this source they came to the men of 
the Most Ancient Church, who were celestial, and were in company with spirits and angels while living on earth. From them the representatives passed to their posterity, and at length to those who merely 
knew that they had such a signification; but because the representatives came from the most ancient times, and were in their Divine worship, they were venerated and held sacred.  [2] Besides representatives, 
there are also correspondences which suggest and also signify something altogether different in the spiritual world from what they do in the natural world; as the heart, the affection of 
good; the eyes, the understanding; the ears, obedience; the hands, power; besides innumerable other correspondences. These are not represented in this way in the world of spirits; but they correspond, 
as what is natural to what is spiritual.  Hence it is that every word, even to the smallest iota of all, in the Word, involves spiritual and heavenly things; and that the Word is in this manner inspired, 
so that when it is read by man, spirits and angels immediately perceive it spiritually according to the representations and correspondences. But this knowledge, which was so much cultivated and 
esteemed by the ancients after the flood, and by means of which they were able to think with spirits and angels, is at this day altogether obliterated, so much so that scarcely anyone is willing to believe 
that it exists; and they who believe in it merely call it a kind of mystical thing, of no use; and this for the reason that man has become altogether worldly and corporeal; to such a degree that 
when what is spiritual and heavenly is mentioned, he feels a repugnance, and sometimes a loathing, or even nausea. What then will he do in the other life, which lasts forever, and where there is nothing 
worldly and corporeal, but only what is spiritual and heavenly, which makes the life in heaven?            GENESIS 22 </p>
<p>     1. And it came to pass after these words, that God did tempt Abraham, 
and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.      2. And He said, Take I pray thy son, thine only one, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee to the land of Moriah, and offer him there 
for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.      3. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his boys with him, and Isaac his son; and 
he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God told him.      4. On the third day, and Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.      5. And 
Abraham said unto his boys, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the boy will go yonder, and we will bow ourselves down, and will come again to you.      6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, 
and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.      7. And Isaac said unto Abraham his father; and he said, My father; 
and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; and where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?      8. And Abraham said, God will see for Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, 
my son: and they went both of them together.      9. And they came to the place which God told him of; and Abraham built there the altar, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid 
him on the altar upon the wood.      10. And Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.      11. And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham; 
and he said, Here am I.      12. And He said, Put not forth thine hand upon the boy, and do not anything unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and thou hast not withheld thy son, thine 
only one, from Me.      13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold a ram behind, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering 
in the stead of his son.      14. And Abraham called the name of that place, Jehovah-will-see, as it is said to this day, In the mountain Jehovah will see.      15. And the angel of Jehovah 
called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven.      16. And said, By Myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only one,      17. 
That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed, as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall inherit the gate of thine 
enemies.      18. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast harkened to My voice.      19. And Abraham returned unto his boys; and they rose up, and went together 
to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt in Beersheba.      20. And it came to pass after these words that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto Nahor thy brother: </p>
<p> 
    21. Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; </p>
<p>     22. And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.      23. And Bethuel begat Rebekah; these eight 
did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.      24. And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah. </p>

These considerations now show where the representatives in the Word and the things in it which carry a spiritual meaning have their origin, namely in the representatives that manifest themselves in the 
next life. It was from the same source that representatives came to members of the Most Ancient Church, who were celestial and who while living on earth were at the same time in the company of spirits 
and angels. From these people those representatives passed to their descendants, and at length to those who did not know anything about them apart from the mere fact that such things were meant by 
them. But because those representatives had come down from most ancient times and were included in their Divine worship, they were venerated and treated as holy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition to representatives 
there are also correspondences, which denote and also mean something altogether different in the spiritual world from what they do in the natural world. The heart, for example, means the affection for 
good; the eyes, the understanding; the ears, obedience; the hand, power; and there are countless other correspondences besides these. These things are not represented in this manner in the world of 
spirits but correspond in the way something natural corresponds to something spiritual. This explains why every word within the Word, down to the smallest letter of all, embodies spiritual and celestial 
matters, and why the Word is inspired in the way it is, that is to say, so inspired that when man is reading it, spirits and angels immediately perceive it spiritually according to the representations 
and correspondences. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But this knowledge which was developed so extensively and valued so highly by the ancients after the Flood, and which enabled them to think with spirits and angels, has 
today been completely wiped out, insomuch that scarcely anybody is willing to believe that it exists. And those who believe that it does exist merely refer to it as something mystical which has no practical 
value, the reason being that mankind has become utterly worldly- and bodily-minded to the point of finding the very mention of what is spiritual and celestial repugnant, and sometimes loathsome, 
even nauseating. How then will they react in the next life which lasts for ever, where not that which is worldly and bodily but solely that which is spiritual and celestial constitutes life in heaven? </p>

Ex his nunc patet unde repraesentativa et significativa in Verbo, quod nempe ex repraesentativis quae existunt in altera vita; inde venerunt illa ad homines Antiquissimae Ecclesiae qui caelestes fuerunt,

<p>CAPUT XXII 1.  Et fuit post verba illa, et Deus tentavit Abrahamum, et dixit 
ad (c)illum, Abraham, et dixit, Ecce ego. 2.  Et dixit, Accipe quaeso filium tuum, unicum tuum, quem amas, Jishakum, et vade tibi ad terram Moriah, et offer eum ibi in holocaustum, super uno montium, 
quem dico ad te. 3.  Et mane surrexit Abraham in matutino, et instravit asinum suum, et accepit duos pueros suos secum, et Jishakum filium suum et fidit ligna holocausti, et surrexit, et ivit ad 
locum, quem dixit ei DEUS. 4.  In die tertio, et sustulit Abraham oculos suos, et vidit locum e longinquo. 5.  Et dixit Abraham ad pueros suos, Manete vobis hic cum asino, et ego et puer ibimus usque 
illuc, et incurvabimus nos, et revertemur ad vos. 6.  Et accepit Abraham ligna holocausti, et posuit super Jishako filio suo; et accepit in manu sua ignem et cultrum, et iverunt ambo illi simul.  7. 
 Et dixit Jishak ad Abraham patrem suum, et dixit, Pater mi; et dixit, Ecce ego, fili mi; et dixit, Ecce ignis et ligna, et ubi pecus in holocaustum? 8.  Et dixit Abraham, DEUS videbit Sibi pecudem 
in holocaustum, fili mi; et iverunt ambo illi una. 9.  Et venerunt ad locum, quem dixit ei DEUS, et aedificabat ibi Abraham altare, et disposuit ligna, et ligavit Jishakum filium suum, et posuit illum 
super altari, desuper ligna. 10.  Et misit Abraham manum suam, et accepit cultrum, ad mactandum filium suum. 11.  Et clamavit ad eum angelus JEHOVAE e caelo, et dixit Abraham, Abraham; et dixit, 
Ecce ego. 12.  Et dixit, Ne mittas manum tuam ad puerum, et ne facias illi quicquam, quia nunc novi, quod timeas DEUM tu, et non cohibuisti filium tuum, unicum tuum, a ME. 13.  Et sustulit Abraham 
oculos suos, et vidit, et ecce aries post detentus in perplexo cornibus suis; et ivit Abraham, et accepit arietem, et obtulit illum in holocaustum loco filii sui. 14.  Et vocavit Abraham nomen loci illius, 
JEHOVAH videbit, quod dicitur hodie, In monte JEHOVAH videbit. 15.  Et clamavit angelus JEHOVAE ad Abraham secundo e caelo. 16.  Et dixit, In Me juravi, dictum JEHOVAE, quia propterea quod fecisti 
verbum hoc, et non cohibuisti filium tuum, unicum tuum. 17.  Quod benedicendo benedicam tibi, et multiplicando multiplicabo semen tuum, tanquam stellas caelorum, et tanquam arenam quae super litore 
maris; et hereditabit semen tuum portam hostium {1}tuorum. 18.  Et benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terrae, propter quod auscultasti voci Meae. 19.  Et reversus est Abraham ad pueros suos; 
et surrexerunt, et iverunt simul ad Beersheba; et habitavit Abraham in Beersheba. 20.  Et fuit post verba illa, et indicatum est Abrahamo, dicendo, Ecce peperit Milkah etiam illa filios Nahori fratri 
tuo. 21.  Uz primogenitum suum, et Buz fratrem ejus, et Kemuel patrem Arami. 22.  Et Kesed, et Hazo, et Pildash, et Jidlaph, et Bethuel.   23.  Et Bethuel genuit Rebeccam: octo illos peperit Nahori 
fratri Abrahami. 24.  Et concubina ejus, et nomen ejus Reumah; et peperit etiam illa Tebah, et Gaham, et Tahash, et Maacah. @1 Heb. = suorum.$ </p>
