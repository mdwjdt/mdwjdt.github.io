<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1547节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1547.</strong>“与罗得”表感官知觉的力量。前面（<a href="1428.htm">1428</a>节）已对此作了简要描述。由于此处明确提到了“罗得”，故必须清楚知道他代表主的哪一方面。法老代表最终送走主的知识；而罗得则代表感官的事物，意指外在人及其源自感性事物的乐趣，因而是指那些最外在，并经常迷惑童年时的心智、使其远离良善的事物。人越是沉迷于恶欲所产生的乐趣，就越远离属于爱和仁的属天之物，因为我欲和物欲就在这些乐趣中，属天之物无法与之和谐一致。不过，有些乐趣虽然表面相似，但实际上与属天之物完全一致（对此，参看<a href="945.htm">945</a>，<a href="994.htm">994</a>，<a href="995.htm">995</a>，<a href="997.htm">997</a>节）。然而，源自恶欲的乐趣必须被抑制并铲除，因为它们挡住了通往属天之物的道路。本章罗得与亚伯兰分离所指的，正是这些乐趣，而非那些与属天之物一致的乐趣；“与罗得”则表示这些乐趣仍存在。不过，“罗得”一般表外在人，这从下文明显可知。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1547.</strong> The symbolism of and Lot with him as the senses was briefly pointed out above at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428" target=_top>1428</a>. Because the present passage discusses Lot in a specific way, the aspect of the Lord that he represents needs to be known. Pharaoh represented facts, which eventually sent the Lord away. Lot, though, symbolizes the sensory dimension, that is, the outer self and its pleasures, which are pleasures of the senses and are therefore our most superficial aspect. They tend to ensnare us when we are young and lead us away from goodness. After all, the more we indulge in the pleasures that rise out of our appetites, the more we are distracted from the heavenly qualities of love and charity. Self-love and materialism, which heavenly love can never harmonize with, permeate those pleasures. Pleasures perfectly consistent with heavenly values exist too, however, and they look the same on the outside (see a discussion of them above at 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_945" target=_top>945</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994" target=_top>994</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_995" target=_top>995</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_997" target=_top>997</a>). But pleasures that rise out of our cravings need to be controlled and purified, because they block the entry to heavenly regions. The current chapter deals with the latter kind of pleasures, not the former, under the image of Lot in his separation from Abram.<br />Here the message is that such pleasures were present, which is what "Lot was with him" means. Usually Lot symbolizes the outer self, though, as will become clear later [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563" target=_top>1563</a>]. </p>

And Lot with him. That this signifies what is sensuous, has already been briefly stated (n. 1428); but as Lot is here specifically treated of, it must be known what it is in the Lord that he represents. 
Pharaoh represented the memory-knowledges that at last sent the Lord away; but Lot represents sensuous things, by which is meant the external man and its pleasures that pertain to sensuous things, 
thus those things which are outermost, and which are wont to captivate man in his childhood, and draw him away from goods. For so far as a man indulges the pleasures that originate from cupidities, he 
is drawn away from the celestial things that are of love and charity; because in those pleasures there is love from self and from the world, with which celestial love cannot agree.  There are, however, 
pleasures that agree perfectly with celestial things, and that likewise appear similar in external form (concerning which see above, n. 945, 994, 995, 997). But the pleasures that originate from 
cupidities are to be restrained and wiped out, because they block the way to celestial things. It is these pleasures, and not the others, that are treated of in this chapter-by Lot, in that he separated 
himself from Abram; and here it is said that such pleasures were present, which are signified by "Lot with him." But in general by "Lot" is signified the external man, as will be evident from what follows. </p>

'And Lot with him' means the power of sensory perception. A brief description of this meaning has been given already in <a href="1428.htm">1428</a>. Because a specific reference is made here to Lot, one needs to know exactly 
what he represents in the Lord. 'Pharaoh' represented facts, which at length 'sent away' the Lord, whereas 'Lot' represented things of the senses, by which are meant the external man and the pleasures 
he derives from sensory things, thus the most external things which usually captivate the mind in childhood and lead it away from the things that are good. For to the extent a person indulges in pleasures 
arising from evil desires he is drawn away from the celestial things that belong to love and charity. Indeed, present within those pleasures there is love originating in self and in the world, 
and with those loves celestial love cannot accord. Besides these however there are pleasures which, despite having similar external appearance, do accord completely with celestial things. For these 
see what has been stated already in <a href="945.htm">945</a>, <a href="994.htm">994</a>, <a href="995.htm">995</a>, <a href="997.htm">997</a>. Pleasures however that have their origins in evil desires must be brought under control and wiped out because they block the approach to celestial 
things. It is these pleasures, not those that accord with celestial things, that are meant in this chapter by Lot's separation from Abram, the presence of those pleasures being meant here by 'tot with 
him'. In general however Lot means the external man, as will be evident from what follows. </p>

</p><b>1547.</b>
'Et Lot cum illo': quod significet sensuale, paucis indicatam est prius n. 1428; hic quia agitur in specie de Loto, sciendum quid is repraesentat apud Dominam; 'Pharaoh' repraesentavit scientifica, 
quae tandem dimiserunt Dominum; 'Lot' autem sensualia, per quae intelligitur externus homo et ejus voluptates quae sensualium sunt, ita quae extima sunt, et hominem in pueritia solent captare et abducere 
a bonis; quantum enim homo indulget voluptatibus oriundis a cupiditatibus, tantam abstrahitur a caelestibus quae sunt amoris a charitatis, inest enim illis amor ex se et ex mundo, cum quibus amor 
caelestis concordare nequit; sed sunt quoque voluptates quae prorsus concordant cum caelestibus, quae quoque externa specie similes apparent, de quibus videantur quae prius n. 945, 994, 995, 997; voluptates 
autem oriundae a cupiditatibus coercendae sunt et abstergendae, quia aditum ad caelestia praecludunt; de his voluptatibus, non de illis, agitur in hoc capite per 'Lotum' quod se separaverit ab 
Abramo': et hic quod tales adessent, quae significantur per 'Lot cum illo': in genere autem per 'Lotum' significatur externus homo, ut patebit ex sequentibus. </p>
