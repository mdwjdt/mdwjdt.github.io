<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3923节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3923.</strong>“因此给他起名叫但”表它的根本性质。这从“名”和“起名”的含义清楚可知，“名”和“起名”是指根本性质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）。具体性质就包含在“但”这个名字中，因为他因“伸冤”（judged）这个动词而被如此称呼。不过，尽管他因“伸冤”（judged）而得名，但这名仍包含拉结的所有这些话，即“神为我伸冤，也听了我的声音”所表示的那些事物。也就是说，“但”这个名含有生活的良善和信仰神圣在里面，在至高意义上含有主的公义和仁慈。教会这个一般原则就由“但”来表示，并由以但命名的支派来代表。在一个人能重生或变成教会之前，这个一般原则必须首先得到肯定或承认。除非这种良善和神圣得到肯定和承认，否则，构成信仰和生活的所有其它品质绝无可能被接受，从而得到肯定，更不用说得到承认了。因为人若凭自己只肯定信仰，而不肯定信仰的神圣，也就是仁爱（仁爱就是信仰的神圣），并且没有通过生活的良善，也就是仁爱行为肯定信仰的神圣，就无法再拥有对信仰本质的热情了，因为他会拒绝之。承认以及肯定是正在重生之人最先获得的一般成就，但却是已重生之人所具有的最后成就。这解释为何对即将重生的人来说，但先到来，约瑟后到来，因为约瑟是属灵之人本身。但对已重生的人来说，约瑟先到来，但后到来。其原因在于，即将重生之人的起点是肯定这些品质（即信仰的神圣和生活的良善）的确如此。而已重生之人，也就是属灵之人已抵达属灵良善本身，并由此视这种肯定为后来者。因为构成信仰的神圣事物和生活的良善已在他里面牢固确立。<br />“但”就表示这种肯定态度，当人正在重生时，这种肯定态度必须首先存在。这一点也可从圣言中提及“但”的其它经文看出来，如雅各，当时叫以色列，关于他儿子们的预言：<br />但必判断他的民，作以色列支派之一；但必作道上的蛇，路中的角蛇，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的坠落于后。耶和华啊，我向来等候你的救恩。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.16.htm">49:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“但”在此表对真理的肯定态度。论到这种态度，当有人出于感官经验推理真理时，经上说它“必作道上的蛇，路中的角蛇”；当这人求教于认知的最低层，或记忆知识，并从中得出结论时，经上说“咬伤马蹄”。他在这样做时，就远离了真理，这一事实由“使骑马的坠落于后”来表示。经上说其后果是，“耶和华啊，我向来等候你的救恩”。“蛇”表示通过感官经验和记忆知识推理神性奥秘的人（参看<a href="195.htm">195</a>-<a href="197.htm">197</a>节）；“道”和“路”表示真理（<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）；“马蹄”表示认知的最低层，或记忆知识（<a href="259.htm">259</a>节）；因为“马”表示认知（<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；认知的最低层由“蹄”（heel：脚后跟）来表示。<br />摩西对十二个支派的预言：<br />论但说，但为小狮子，从巴珊跳出来。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.22.htm">33:22</a>）<br />就圣言的内义而言，“狮子” 因其力量而表示教会的真理，因为真理就是那去争战并得胜的。因此，“小狮子”表示真理的第一个阶段，就是肯定和承认。经上之所以说“从巴珊”，是因为这些始于属世层的良善。耶利米书：<br />耶路撒冷啊，你当洗去心中的恶，使你可以得救。恶念存在你里面要到几时呢？有声音从但传扬，从以法莲山听到祸患。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.14.htm">4:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“从但”表要得到肯定的真理；“从以法莲山”表这种肯定来自对它的情感。<br />同一先知书：<br />我们指望平安，却得不着好处；指望痊愈的时候，不料，受了惊惶。听见从但那里他的马喷鼻气；他的壮马发嘶声，全地就都震动；因为他们来吞灭这地和其上所有的，吞灭这城与其中的居民。看哪！我必打发蛇、毒蛇到你们中间，是不服法术的，必咬你们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.15.htm">8:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“听见从但那里马喷鼻气”表出于非肯定的态度推理真理。“地就都震动”和“他们吞灭其上所有的”表教会和构成教会的全部事物。因为出于非肯定或否定态度推理真理的人摧毁信的一切事物。“毒蛇”表推理，如前所述。<br />以西结书：<br />但人和雅完人来你集市上拿亮铁、桂皮、菖蒲与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.19.htm">27:19</a>）<br /> <br />这论述的是推罗，推罗表示真理与良善的认知（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。“但”表示得到肯定的最初真理；“集市和交易”表真理与良善的获取（<a href="2967.htm">2967</a>节）；“亮铁”表属世真理，也就是最初真理（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="426.htm">426</a>节）；“桂皮、菖蒲”表示良善从中所流出的属世真理。<br />阿摩司书：<br />当那日，美貌的处女和少年的男子必因干渴发昏。那指着撒玛利亚的罪孽起誓的说，但哪，你那活神；别是巴的活道；他们都必仆倒，不再起来。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.13.htm">8:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“但哪，你那活神；别是巴的活道”表示他们对构成信及其教义的一切事物的否定态度。“道”表真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）；“别是巴”表教义（<a href="2723.htm">2723</a>，<a href="2858.htm">2858</a>，<a href="2859.htm">2859</a>，<a href="3466.htm">3466</a>节）。之所以表示对信的一切事物的否定态度，是因为但是迦南地的最后边界，而别是巴是最初边界，即那地的中间或核心。因为迦南地代表并表示主的国度，因而代表并表示教会（<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>节），相应地代表并表示爱与信的一切细节，因为这些构成主的国度和教会。因此，迦南地境内的一切事物都是照着它们的距离、位置和边界而具有代表性（<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>节）。<br />在耶路撒冷变得如此之前，最初边界，即那地的中间或核心是别是巴，因为亚伯拉罕在那里，以撒也生活在那里。但最后边界，或那地最外面的点，就是但。因此，当表示作为一个整体的一切事物时，经上就说“从但直到别是巴”。如撒母耳记：<br />把国从扫罗家挪走，把大卫的宝座立于以色列和犹大之上，从但直到别是巴。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.10.htm">3:10</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />将以色列众人，从但直到别是巴，都聚集起来。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下17.11.htm">17:11</a>）<br /><br />大卫吩咐约押走遍以色列众支派，从但直到别是巴。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.15.htm">15</a>）<br />列王纪：<br />从但直到别是巴，犹大和以色列，各人都在自己的葡萄树下和无花果树下安然居住。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上4.25.htm">4:25</a>）<br />这个短语（即从但直到别是巴）在历史意义上表示迦南地的一切事物，但在内义上表示构成主国度的一切事物，以及构成教会的一切事物。<br />如前所述，“但”之所以表示最初边界，以及最后边界，是因为对真理与良善的肯定态度是当信与仁开始存在于人里面时一切事物的首要条件，但当仁和随之的信在人里面得以确立时，就是最后条件。这也是为何当分迦南地业时，但拾到最后一个阄（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书19.40.htm">19:40</a>等）；因为阄是在耶和华面前拈的（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书18.6.htm">18:6</a>）；因此阄照着各支派的代表拈出。<br />由于但没有拈到阄，从而在其余支派当中得着地业，而是在他们的边界之外得着地业（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士18.1.htm">18:1</a>），所以约翰在提及受印的一万二千时，也略去了这个支派（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.5.htm">7:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.8.htm">8</a>）。因为那些只是肯定真理和良善，却止步不前的人并不在主的国度里面，即不在那些受印的人当中。甚至最坏的人也能认识真理与良善，还能肯定它们；但其肯定的真正性质从他们所过的生活就能得知。<br />经上在创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.14.htm">14:14</a>）也将但当作边界来提及，在这一节描述了亚伯拉罕追赶敌人，直追到但，但在此也具有同样的含义。但的后代那时的确没有建立名为“但”的城市，但后来建立了（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书19.47.htm">19:47</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士18.29.htm">18:29</a>）；然而，甚至那时它也被当作进入迦南地的最初边界，或离开迦南地的最后边界；那地的核心部分就是希伯仑，后来是亚伯拉罕和以撒所住的别是巴。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3923</b></p><p><b>3923.</b>
Therefore she called his name Dan. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of a "name" and of "calling a name," as being quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3421). 
The quality itself is within the name "Dan," for he was so called from "judging." But though the name was given to him from "judging," it nevertheless involves what is signified by all these words 
of Rachel: "God hath judged me, and also hath heard my voice," that is, the good of life, and the holy of faith, and also in the supreme sense the justice and mercy of the Lord. It is this general 
principle of the church that is signified by "Dan," and that is represented by the tribe named from Dan. This general principle is the first that is to be affirmed or acknowledged, before a man can be 
regenerated or made a church. Unless these things are affirmed and acknowledged, the rest of the things both of faith and of life cannot possibly be received, and therefore cannot be affirmed, still 
less acknowledged. For he who affirms mere faith with himself, and not the holy of faith, that is, charity (for this is the holy of faith), and does not affirm this by the good of life, that is, by the 
works of charity, can no longer have a relish for the essence of faith, because he rejects it. Affirmation together with acknowledgment is the first general principle with the man who is being regenerated, 
but is the last with him who has been regenerated; and therefore "Dan" is the first with him who is to be regenerated, and "Joseph" is the last; for "Joseph" is the spiritual man himself. But 
"Joseph" is the first with him who has been regenerated, and "Dan" the last; because the man who is to be regenerated commences from the affirmation that it is so, namely, the holy of faith and the good 
of life. But the regenerate man, who is spiritual, is in spiritual good itself, and from this he regards such affirmation as last; for with him the holy things of faith and goods of life have been 
confirmed. [2] That "Dan" is the affirmative which must be the first thing when a man is being regenerated, may also be seen from other passages in the Word where "Dan" is named; as from the prophecy 
of Jacob, then Israel, respecting his sons: </p>
<p>     Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel; Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an adder upon the path, that biteth the horse's heels, 
and his rider falleth backward. I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah (Gen. 49:16-18). "Dan" here denotes the affirmative of truth, concerning which it is said that it will be "a serpent upon the way, 
and an adder upon the path," when anyone reasons about truth from sensuous things; "biting the horse's heels," when it consults the lowest intellectual things or memory-knowledges, and draws conclusions 
from them; and that it is then led away from the truth, is signified by "his rider falling backward;" for which reason it is said, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah." That the "serpent" is the 
man who reasons from sensuous things and memory-knowledges concerning Divine arcana, may be seen above (n. 195-197); and that "way" and "path" signify truth (n. 627, 2333); and that the "horse's heels" 
are the lowest intellectual things or memory-knowledges (n. 259); for a "horse" is the intellectual (n. 2761, 2762); the lowest part of which is the "heel." [3] Again in the prophecy of Moses concerning 
the twelve tribes: </p>
<p>     Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp, he leapeth forth from Bashan (Deut. 33:22); </p>
<p>a "lion" in the internal sense of the Word signifies the truth of the church, from his 
strength, for truth is that which fights and conquers; hence a "lion's whelp" denotes the first of truth, which is affirmation and acknowledgment. It is said "from Bashan," because it is from the good 
of the natural. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Wash thine heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved. How long makest thou the thoughts of thine iniquity to lodge in the midst of thee? For a 
voice declareth from Dan, and causeth to hear iniquity from Mount Ephraim (Jer. 4:14-15); </p>
<p>"from Dan," denotes the truth that is to be affirmed; "from Mount Ephraim," that it is from the affection of 
it. [4] In the same: </p>
<p>     Wait for peace, but there is no good; and for a time of healing, and behold terror. The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighings of his strong 
ones the whole land trembled; and they came and devoured the land and the fullness thereof, the city and them that dwell therein. For behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which 
there is no enchantment, and they shall bite you (Jer. 8:15-17); </p>
<p>"the snorting of horses heard from Dan" denotes reasoning concerning truth from what is nonaffirmative; the "land that trembled," and 
their "devouring the fullness thereof," denotes the church and all the things of the church; for they who reason concerning truth from what is nonaffirmative (that is,  negative) destroy all things 
of faith; the "basilisk serpents" denote reasonings, as above. [5] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Dan and Javan coming in gave bright iron in thy fairs; cassia and calamus were in thy trading (Ezek. 27:19); </p>
<p>where 
Tyre is the subject treated of, by which are signified the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1201). "Dan" denotes the first truths that are affirmed; "fairs" and "trading," the acquisitions of truth 
and good (n. 2967); the "bright iron," natural truth which is the first (n. 425, 426); "cassia and calamus," natural truth from which there is good. [6] In Amos: </p>
<p>     In that day shall the fair virgins 
and the young men faint for thirst. They that swear by the guilt of Samaria, and have said, Thy God, O Dan, liveth; and the way of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and shall rise up no more 
(Amos 8:13-14); </p>
<p>"Thy God, O Dan, liveth, and the way of Beersheba liveth" denotes that they are in the denial of all things of faith and its doctrine. (That "way" denotes truth, see above, n. 627, 2333; 
and "Beersheba," doctrine, n. 2723, 2858, 2859, 3466.) That there is signified the denial of all things of faith, is because Dan was the last boundary of the land of Canaan, and Beersheba the first, 
that is, the midst or inmost of the land; for by the "land of Canaan" was represented and signified the Lord's kingdom, and thus the church (n. 1607, 3038, 3481), and accordingly all things of love 
and faith, because these are of the Lord's kingdom and church. Hence all things in the land of Canaan were representative, according to their distances, situations, and boundaries (n. 1585, 1866, 3686). [7] 
The first boundary, that is, the midst or inmost of the land, was Beersheba, before Jerusalem became so, because Abraham was there, and also Isaac; but the last boundary, or the outermost of 
the land, was Dan; and hence when all things in one complex were signified, it was said, "from Dan even to Beersheba;" as in the second book of Samuel: </p>
<p>     To transfer the kingdom from the house of 
Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba (2 Sam. 3:10). In the same: </p>
<p>     All Israel gathering was gathered together from Dan even to Beersheba 
(2 Sam. 17:11). And again: </p>
<p>     David said to Joab, Pass through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to Beersheba (2 Sam. 24:2, 15). And in the first book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Judah and Israel dwelt 
in security, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beersheba (1 Kings 4:25). By this expression are meant in the historic sense all things of the land of Canaan; but in the 
internal sense all things of the Lord's kingdom, and also all things of the church. [8] The reason why, as before said, "Dan" is the first boundary, and also the last, is that the affirmative of truth 
and good is the first of all things when faith and charity are beginning with man, and the last when man is in charity and thereby in faith. It was from this also that the last lot fell to Dan when 
the land of Canaan was divided for inheritance (Josh. 19:40, etc.); for the lot was cast before Jehovah (Josh. 18:6); and hence it fell according to the representation of each tribe. [9] And because 
the lot did not fall to Dan among the inheritances of the rest of the tribes, but beyond their borders (Judges 18:1), that tribe was omitted by John in the Revelation (Rev. 7:5-8), where the twelve 
thousand that were sealed are mentioned; for they who are only in the affirmative of truth and also of good, and go no further, are not in the Lord's kingdom, that is, among the "sealed." Even the worst 
men are able to know truths and goods, and also to affirm them; but the quality of the affirmation is known from the life.  [10] "Dan" is also mentioned as a boundary in Gen. 14:14, where Abraham 
is described as having pursued the enemy thus far, and where "Dan" has a similar signification. The city called "Dan" was not indeed built by the posterity of Dan at that time, but afterwards (Josh. 
19:47; Judges 18:29); yet even then it was called the first boundary with respect to entering into the land of Canaan, or the last with respect to going out; and the inmost of the land was Hebron, and 
afterwards Beersheba, where Abraham and Isaac dwelt. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3923</b></p><p><b>3923.</b>
'Therefore she called his name Dan' means the essential nature of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'name' and 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>. The particular nature is contained in the name Dan, for he was so called from the verb 'to judge'. But although he was given this name from that verb, it nevertheless includes those things 
meant in the whole of Rachel's utterance 'God has judged me, and also has heard my voice'. That is, the name Dan holds within it the good of life and the holiness of faith, and also in the highest 
sense the Lord's righteousness and mercy. This general essential of the Church is meant by Dan and represented by the tribe named after Dan, and it is the first that has to be affirmed and acknowledged 
before a person can be regenerated or become the Church. Unless such goodness and holiness are affirmed and acknowledged, all the other qualities constituting faith and life cannot possibly be received, 
nor therefore affirmed, still less acknowledged. For anyone whose affirmation does not go beyond faith to the holiness of faith, which is charity - for charity is the holiness of faith - and does 
not affirm that holiness of faith through the good of life, that is, through charitable works, can no longer have any enthusiasm for the essence of faith since he rejects it. Acknowledgement as well 
as affirmation is the first general attainment in a person who is being regenerated but the last with one who has been regenerated. This explains why Dan comes first with one who is to be regenerated 
and Joseph last, for Joseph is the spiritual man himself, but why Joseph comes first with one who has been regenerated and Dan last. The reason for this is that one who is to be regenerated is at the 
point of beginning to affirm that these qualities - the holiness of faith and the good of life - are truly such. But one who is regenerate - a spiritual man - has arrived at spiritual good itself, and 
from here he sees the affirmation of those qualities as that which comes last, because the things that constitute the holiness of faith and the good of life have become firmly established in him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
That 'Dan' means this affirmative attitude which must exist first when a person is being regenerated may also be seen from other places in the Word where Dan is mentioned, for example from the prophecy 
of Jacob, who by then was Israel, concerning his own sons, Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan will be a serpent on the road, an asp on the path, biting the horse's heels; 
and its rider falls backwards. I am awaiting Your salvation, O Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:16-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:16-18</a>. </p>
<p>'Dan' in this case stands for an affirmative attitude to truth. This attitude is spoken of as a serpent which 
will be on the road and an asp on the path when someone reasoning about truth does so from sensory evidence. 'Biting the horse's heels' means when that person resorts to the lowest level of the understanding 
- namely factual knowledge - and bases his conclusions on this. And the fact that when he does so he is drawn away from the truth is meant by 'its rider falls backwards', as a consequence 
of which it is said that 'I am awaiting Your salvation, O Jehovah'. For 'a serpent' means one who reasons from sensory evidence and from factual knowledge about Divine arcana, see <a href="195.htm">195</a>-<a href="197.htm">197</a>; 'road' and 
'path' mean truth, <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>; 'the horse's heels' means the lowest level of the understanding, which is factual knowledge, <a href="259.htm">259</a> - 'a horse' meaning the understanding, <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, the lowest level of which 
is meant by 'the heel'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Moses' prophecy regarding the twelve tribes, </p>
<blockquote>
To Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp; he leaps out from Bashan. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A lion' in the internal sense of 
the Word means the truth of the Church, on account of its strength, truth being that which fights and overcomes. 'A lion's whelp' therefore stands for the first stage truth passes through, which is one 
of affirmation and acknowledgement. The phrase 'from Bashan' is used because these begin in the good of the natural. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Wash your heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that you may be saved. 
How long are you causing your iniquitous thoughts to lodge within you? For there is a voice of one declaring from Dan, and of one causing iniquity to be heard from Mount Ephraim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'From 
Dan' stands for truth that is to be affirmed, 'from Mount Ephraim' for this being done from the affection for it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Await peace, and no good comes; for a time of healing, 
and behold, terror! From Dan the snorting of his horses was heard; at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land quaked. And they came and devoured the land and the fulness of 
it, the city and those dwelling in it. For behold, I am sending into you poisonous serpents which do not respond to charming; and they will bite you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:15-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:15-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'From Dan the snorting of horses 
was heard' stands for reasoning about truth from an unaffirmative attitude. 'The land which quaked' and 'they devoured the fulness of it' stand for the Church and all things constituting the Church. 
For people who reason about truth from an unaffirmative or negative attitude destroy everything that is part of faith. 'Poisonous serpents' stands for reasonings, as above. </p>

 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Dan and 
Javan came and exchanged wrought iron at your fairs, cassia and calamus were in your trading. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means cognitions of truth and good, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. 'Dan' stands for the 
first truths that are affirmed, 'fairs and tradings' for acquisitions of truth and good, <a href="2967.htm">2967</a>, 'wrought iron' stands for natural truth, which is primary, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>, 'cassia and calamus' for the same, 
but natural truth from which good flows. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst. Those swearing to the offence of Samaria, who say, Your God lives, 
O Dan, and the way of Beersheba lives, they will both fall and not rise again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:-13,14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:-13,14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Your God lives, O Dan, and the way of Beersheba lives' stands for their negative attitude towards 
everything that constitutes faith and its doctrine - 'way' meaning truth, <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>, and 'Beersheba' doctrine, <a href="2723.htm">2723</a>, <a href="2858.htm">2858</a>, <a href="2859.htm">2859</a>, <a href="3466.htm">3466</a>. The reason a negative attitude towards everything constituting faith 
is meant is that Dan was the last boundary of the land of Canaan, and Beersheba the first; that is, it was situated in the middle or inmost part of the land. For the land of Canaan represented and 
meant the Lord's kingdom, and so the Church, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, and therefore every detail of love and faith, since these constitute the Lord's kingdom and Church. Consequently everything in the land 
of Canaan was representative, being determined by the distances, positions, and boundaries there, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The first - that is, the central or inmost - point of reference to the land, 
before Jerusalem became such, was Beersheba; for this was where Abraham and also Isaac lived. But the outermost point of reference or the last boundary was Dan. Consequently when everything in its entirety 
was meant the phrase 'Den even to Beersheba' was used, as in the second Book of Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
To transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, 
from Dan even to Beersheba. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%203:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 3:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The whole of Israel from Dan even to Beersheba will be assembled together. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%2017:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 17:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
David said to Joab, 
Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to Beersheba. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2024:2,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 24:2, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, from 
Dan even to Beersheba. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 4:25. </p>
<p>This phrase is used in the historical sense to mean every part of the land of Canaan, but in the internal sense everything constituting the Lord's kingdom, and 
also everything constituting the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Dan means the first boundary, and also - as stated above - the last boundary, for the reason that the affirmative attitude towards truth and good is the 
first requirement of all when faith and charity begin to be present in a person, but the last when charity and consequently faith are established in him. This is also why the last lot fell to Dan when 
the land of Canaan was divided up for inheritance, Josh. 19:40 and following verses; for the lot was cast before Jehovah, Josh. 18:6. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 That lot fell therefore according to what each tribe represented. 
And since the lot to Dan did not fall among the inheritances of all the other tribes but beyond their boundaries, Judg. 18:1, that tribe was also left out of the description in John, in Rev. 
7:5-8, concerning each twelve thousand who had been sealed. For those who merely affirm truth and also good, but go no further, are not within the Lord's kingdom, that is, among those who have been 
sealed. Even very wicked people may know truths and goods, and may also affirm them; but the true nature of their affirming is recognized from the life they lead. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Dan is also referred to as a 
boundary in Gen. 14:14, in which verse it is said that Abraham pursued his enemies as far as there, and in which verse Dan has a similar meaning. The city called Dan, it is true, had yet to be built by 
Dan's descendants at a later time, Josh. 19:47; Judg. 18:29; but even at that time it was referred to as the first boundary when one was entering the land of Canaan but the last when one was leaving 
it, the inmost part of the land being Hebron, and later on Beersheba, where Abraham and Isaac lived. </p>

`Propterea vocavit nomen ejus Dan': quod significet quale ejus, constat a significatione `nominis' et `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3421; ipsum quale 
est in nomine Danis, dictus enim est a judicare, sed nomen ei tametsi a judicare inditum est, usque involvit illa quae significantur per omnia {1}haec Rachelis verba, `Judicavit me Deus, et etiam audivit 
vocem meam,' hoc est, bonum vitae, et sanctum fidei, tum in supremo sensu justitiam et misericordiam Domini; </p>
<p>commune illud Ecclesiae est quod significatur per Danem, et quod repraesentatur per 
tribum a Dane nominatam: hoc commune est primum quod affirmandum seu agnoscendum est antequam homo potest regenerari seu fieri Ecclesia; nisi illa affirmantur et agnoscuntur, reliqua quae fidei 
et quae vitae sunt, nequaquam recipi possunt, proinde nec affirmari, minus agnosci; qui enim solum affirmat apud se fidem, et non sanctum fidei, hoc est, charitatem, nam haec est sanctum fidei, et 
si non affirmat hoc per bonum vitae, hoc est, per charitatis opera, is non potest sapere essentiam fidei amplius, nam rejicit illam; affirmatio tum agnitio est primum commune apud hominem qui regeneratur, 
sed est ultimum apud hominem qui regeneratus est, quare `Dan' est primum apud regenerandum, ac `Joseph' est ultimum, est enim `Joseph' ipse spiritualis homo, at `Joseph' est primum apud regeneratum, 
et `Dan' est ultimum, quia regenerandus incohat ab affirmatione quod sit, nempe sanctum fidei et bonum vitae, at regeneratus qui est spiritualis, est in ipso bono spirituali, et inde spectat 
ut ultimum quod sit, nam confirmata apud illum sunt sancta fidei et bona vitae.  [2] Quod `Dan' sit affirmativum quod primum erit cum regeneratur homo, constare quoque potest ab aliis locis in 
Verbo ubi Dan nominatur; ut ex prophetia Jacobi tunc Israelis de filiis suis,      Dan judicabit populum suum, sicut una tribuum Israelis: erit      Dan serpens super via, aspis super semita, mordens 
calcaneos      equi, et cadit eques ejus retro; salutem Tuam exspecto      Jehovah, Gen. xlix 16-18; </p>
<p>`Dan' hic pro affirmativo veri, de quo nempe affirmativo dicitur quod `erit serpens super via, 
et aspis super semita,' cum ratiocinatur de vero ex sensualibus; `mordens calcaneos equi,' cum infima intellectualia seu scientifica consulit, et ex illis concludit; et quod tunc abducatur a vero, 
significatur per quod `cadat eques ejus retro,' quare dicitur `salutem Tuam exspecto Jehovah'; quod `serpens' sit qui ratiocinatur ex sensualibus et scientificis de arcanis Divinis, videatur n. 
195-197; quod `via' et `semita' sit verum, n. 627, 2333; quod `calcanei equi' sint infima intellectualia seu scientifica, n. 259; `equus' enim est intellectuale, n. 2761, 2762, cujus infimum est `calcaneus.' 
 [3] In prophetia Mosis de duodecim tribubus,      Ad Dan dixit, Dan catulus leonis, exsilit e Bashane, Deut.      xxxiii 22; </p>
<p>`leo' in sensu interno Verbi significat verum Ecclesiae, ex fortitudine, 
verum enim est quod pugnat et vincit, inde `catulus leonis' pro primo veri, quod est affirmatio et agnitio; `ex Bashane' dicitur quia ex bono naturalis: apud Jeremiam,      Ablue a 
malitia cor tuum, Hierosolyma, propterea ut salveris,      quamdiu facis commorari in medio tui cogitationes iniquitatis      tuae; quia vox indicantis e Dane, et audire facientis      iniquitatem 
e monte Ephraim, iv 14, 15; </p>
<p>`e Dane' pro vero quod affirmandum, `e monte Ephraim' pro ex affectione ejus: [4] apud eundem,      Exspecta pacem, et non bonum, ad tempus sanationis, et ecce      terror: 
a Dane auditus fremitus equorum ejus, a voce hinnituum      fortium ejus, contremuit omnis terra, et venerunt et      consumpserunt terram et plenitudinem ejus, urbem et habitantes      in ea; 
quia ecce Ego mittens in vos serpentes regulos, quibus      non incantatio, et mordebunt vos, viii 15, 16 [17]; </p>
<p>`a Dane auditus fremitus equorum' pro ratiocinatione de vero ex non `affirmativo, `terra 
quae contremuit, et cujus plenitudinem consumpserunt' pro Ecclesia et omnibus Ecclesiae; qui enim de vero ex non affirmativo seu ex negativo ratiocinantur, illi destruunt omnia fidei; [5] `serpentes 
reguli' pro ratiociniis, ut supra: apud Ezechielem,      Dan et Javan adveniens in nundinis tuis dederunt ferrum      tersum, casia et calamus in negotiatione tua fuit, xxvii 19; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro, 
per quam significantur cognitiones veri et boni, n. 1201; `Dan' pro veris primis quae affirmantur, `nundinae et negotiationes' pro acquisitionibus `veri et boni', n. 2967; `ferrum tersum' pro vero 
naturali, quod primum est, n. 425, 426; `casia et calamus' pro simili, sed ex quo bonum: [6] apud Amos,      In die illo deficient virgines pulchrae et juvenes in siti; </p>
<p>     jurantes in reatum Samariae, 
et dixerunt, Vivit Deus tuus Dan,      et vivit via Beershebae, et cadent et non resurgent amplius,      viii [13], 14; </p>
<p>`vivit Deus Dan et vivit via Beershebae' pro quod in negativo omnium 
quae fidei et ejus doctrinae sunt; quod `via' sit verum, n. 627, 2333; `Beersheba' doctrina n. 2723, 2858, 2859, 3466; quod sit negativum omnium quae fidei sunt, est quia Dan erat ultimus terminus 
terrae Canaanis, et Beersheba primus, seu medium {4}aut intimum terrae; per terram enim Canaanem repraesentatum est et significatum regnum Domini, ita Ecclesia, n. 1607, 3038, 3481; </p>
<p>proinde omnia 
amoris et fidei, nam haec sunt regni Domini et Ecclesiae; inde omnia quae in terra Canaane repraesentativa fuerunt secundum distantias, situs, terminos, n. 1585, 1866, 3686; [7] primus terminus, seu 
medium aut intimum terrae fuerat Beersheba, antequam Hierosolyma, quia Abraham ibi fuit, tum Jishak, {5}at ultimus terminus seu extimum {6}erat Dan, inde cum omnia in uno complexu significarentur, 
dicebatur `a Dane usque ad Beershebam'; </p>
<p>ut in Libro Secundo Samuelis,      Ad transferendum regnum a domo Shaulis, et ad erigendum solium      Davidis super Israelem et super Jehudam, a Dane et 
usque ad      Beershebam, iii 10: </p>
<p>in eodem,      Congregando (x)congregabitur universus Israel a Dane usque      Beershebam, xvii 11: </p>
<p>in eodem,      Dixit David ad Joabum,... Pervagare omnes tribus 
Israelis a      Dane usque Beershebam, xxiv 2, 15: </p>
<p>in Libro Primo Regum,      Habitavit Jehudah et Israel in securitate, quisque sub vite      sua, et sub ficu sua, a Dane et usque Beershebam, 
v 5 [A. V.      iv 25]; </p>
<p>per quae in sensu historico intelliguntur omnia terrae Canaanis, sed in sensu interno omnia regni Domini, tum omnia Ecclesiae; [8] quod Dan sit {7}primus terminus, et quoque 
quod sit ultimus, ut supra dictum, est quia affirmativum veri et boni est omnium primum cum incohat fides et charitas apud hominem, et ultimum cum homo in charitate et inde in fide est: {8}inde 
etiam erat quod sors ultima caderet pro Dane cum hereditaretur terra Canaan, Jos. xix 40 seq; </p>
<p>nam jacta fuit sors coram Jehovah, Jos. xviii 6; [9] inde contigit secundum repraesentationem cujusvis 
tribus; et quia Dani non cecidit sors inter hereditates reliquarum tribuum, sed ultra terminos illarum, Jud. xviii 1, etiam praetermissa est illa tribus apud Johannem in Apoc. vii 5-8, ubi agitur de 
duodecim millibus obsignatis; qui enim in solo affirmativo veri et quoque boni sunt, nec ulterius vadunt, non sunt in regno Domini, {9}hoc est, inter obsignatos; scire vera et bona, et quoque affirmare 
illa, possunt quoque pessimi, sed ex vita cognoscitur qualis affirmatio est. [10] Memoratur etiam Dan, ut terminus, Gen. xiv 14, ubi de Abrahamo, quod persecutus hostes usque illuc, et per Dan 
ibi simile significatur; urbs Dan dicta, non quidem tunc exstructa fuit a Danis posteris, sed postea, Jos. xix 47; Jud. xviii 29; sed ita etiam tunc temporis vocabatur primus terminus respective 
ad introitum in terram Canaanem, seu ultimus respective ad exitum, ac intimum ejus Hebron, et dein Beersheba, ubi Abraham et Jishak. @1 illa$ @2 affirmatione ejus$ @3 illorum$ @4 seu intimum ejus$ @5
