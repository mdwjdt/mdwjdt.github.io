<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1037.</strong>前面已阐明，“神说”表事情就是这样，因为“神说”或“耶和华说”，或“祂说过”表事情就是这样。上古之人将教会事物整理成历史形式，当他们想断言某事就是这样时，就会说“神说”或“耶和华说”，对他们而言，这是用来断言和证实某事的一种常见表达方式。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1037.</strong> The fact that and God said means that it was so has already been stated and demonstrated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1037/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_630" target=_top>630</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1037/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_708" target=_top>708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1037/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_926" target=_top>926</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1037/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020" target=_top>1020</a>], because to say and God (or in other words Jehovah) says means that a thing is so.<br />The earliest people constructed stories out of their religious affairs, so when they wanted to affirm that a thing was so, they said "God said" or "Jehovah said," and for them this was a standard way of asserting a thing and vouching for it. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1037</b></p><p><b>1037.</b>
And God said. That this signifies that it was so, has been said and shown before; for the "saying of God" or "of Jehovah" signifies that it was so. The most ancient people arranged the things of the 
church in the form of history; and when they wished to affirm that a thing was so, they said that "God said" or "Jehovah said" and this was their form of asseveration and confirmation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1037</b></p><p><b>1037.</b>
That 'and God said' means that it was so has been stated and shown already; for God's or Jehovah's saying, or His having said, means that it was so. Because the most ancient people used to weave together 
as a historical tale things to do with the Church, they would say, when wishing to assert that something was so, 'God said' or 'Jehovah said'. With them this was a commonplace expression for asserting 
and confirming something. </p>

</p><b>1037.</b>
'Et dixit Deus': quod significet ita esse, prius dictam et ostensum est, nam dicere aut dictum Dei seu Jehovae, significat ita esse: antiquissimi quia historice concinnabant res Ecclesiae, cum affirmare 
vellent quod ita esset, dicebant, 'dixit Deus,' vel 'dixit Jehovah,' et erat illis formula asseverationis et confirmationis. </p>
