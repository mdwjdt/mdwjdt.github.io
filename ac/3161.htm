<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3161节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3161.</strong>“看哪，利百加在你面前，可以将她带去，照着耶和华所说的，作你主人儿子的妻子”表由主所启示的同意。这也可从这几句话的解释明显看出来；就内义而言，这是从这几句话所得出的一般结论。其中的情形是这样：主在世时凭自己的能力使祂自己里面的人性变成神性。人性始于理性的至内在部分（<a href="2106.htm">2106</a>，<a href="2194.htm">2194</a>节）。本节描述了祂如何使这人性变成神性；也就是说，之前早已在良善方面使人性变成神性，现在则在真理方面使人性变成神性，因为理性由良善与真理构成。那里的良善出自祂的本质神性，即出自祂所成孕的耶和华父；而那里的真理必须以和其他人一样的寻常方式获得。<br />众所周知，人并非生来理性，只是具有变得理性的能力。他通过记忆知识或事实知识，即通过分为许多属和种的认知变得理性，其中第一类知识是通向下一类的工具，如此依次是最后一类的工具。这最后一类就是主国度的属灵事物的认知，被称为教义。这后一类认知部分从信之教义得来，部分直接从圣言得来，因而部分通过人自己的学习得来，这也是众所周知的。只要这些教义停留在记忆中，它们就只是记忆知识形式的真理或事实真理，还不能作为人自己的东西而归给他。当人开始为了生活而热爱它们，尤其将它们应用于生活时，它们才首次被归给他。当发生这种情形时，真理从属世记忆中被提升上来，进入心智的理性部分，在那里与良善联结。它们一旦联结，就不再仅属于记忆知识，而是属于生活。因为这时，人不再通过真理学习当如何生活，而是通过它们生活。真理以这种方式被归给他，并变成意愿的事。他因此步入天上的婚姻，因为天上的婚姻就在于良善与真理在理性中的联结。对世人来说，这些事都是由主实现的。<br />但主凭祂自己在自己里面做所有这些事。祂不仅通过神性本身生出理性人的良善，还通过这理性人生出属世人的真理，祂将这真理联结于良善。正是良善为自己选择了真理，还赋予它形式，因为良善只承认与其一致的真理。主的神圣良善以这种方式为自己塑造真理；它将真理认作那与神圣良善一致的，也就是来自祂的神性，而非别的东西。因此，祂凭自己的能力成就一切事，无论总体还是细节。所有这一切就是“承认这话唯独是主的”和“由主所启示的同意”所表示的。</p>

Behold Rebekah is before thee; take her and go, and let her be the woman of thy lord's son, as Jehovah hath spoken. That this signifies consent inspired from the Lord, is also evident from the explication 
of the several words, of which in the internal sense this is a general conclusion. The case herein is this: When the Lord lived in the world He by His own power made the human in Himself Divine. 
The human begins in the inmost of the rational (n. 2106, 2194); and it is here described how He made this Divine; namely, that as this had been done before as to good, so now it is done as to truth; 
for the rational consists of good and truth. The good there, was from His veriest Divine, that is, from Jehovah the Father, of whom He was conceived; but the truth was to be procured in the ordinary way, 
as with other men. [2] For it is well known that man is not born rational, but only into the capacity of becoming rational; and that he becomes so through memory-knowledges, namely through knowledges 
of many genera and species, the first of which are means leading to those which follow next, and this in order even to the last, which are knowledges of the spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, 
and are called doctrinal things. That these are learned in part from the doctrine of faith, in part immediately from the Word, and so in part by the man's own study, is also well known. So long as these 
doctrinal things are only in the memory, they are only truths in the form of memory-knowledge; nor are they yet appropriated to the man as his; but they are for the first time appropriated to him 
when he begins to love them for the sake of life, and still more when he applies them to life. When this is done, then the truths are raised out of the natural memory into the rational, and are there 
conjoined with good; and when they have been conjoined, they are no longer of memory-knowledge merely, but of the life; for then the man no longer learns from truths how he should live, but lives from 
them, and thereby the truths are appropriated to him, and become of the will. Thus man enters into the heavenly marriage; for the heavenly marriage is the conjunction of good and truth in the rational. 
These things the Lord does with men. [3] But in Himself the Lord did all these things from Himself; and from the Divine Itself He not only begat the rational as to good, but also through this the 
natural as to truth, which He conjoined with good; for it is good that chooses truth for itself, and also forms it, since good acknowledges nothing else as truth than that which is in agreement. In this 
way did the Divine good, which was the Lord's, make for itself truth; nor did it acknowledge as truth anything else than that which agreed with Divine good, that is, that was Divine from Him. Thus 
He did all things both in general and in particular from His own power. All this is what is signified by the acknowledgment that it was of the Lord alone, and by consent inspired from the Lord. </p>

'Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as Jehovah has spoken' means consent inspired from the Lord. This too could be shown by an explanation of all 
the individual words, the general import of these in the internal sense being the meaning that has just been stated. The implications are as follows: When the Lord lived in the world He made the Human 
within Himself Divine by His own power, the human with everyone having its beginnings in the inmost part of the rational, <a href="2106.htm">2106</a>, <a href="2194.htm">2194</a>. This verse describes how He made it Divine, that is to say, already 
so as of good and of truth. The good there came from His essential Divinity, that is, from Jehovah the Father from whom He had been conceived; but the truth there had to be acquired by the ordinary 
way, as with every other human being. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is well known that nobody is born rational but merely into the ability to become so, and that he becomes rational by means of factual knowledge, that 
is to say, by means of cognitions which divide up into many genera and species, the first of which are the means leading on to those next to them, and so on in order to the last of all which are cognitions 
of the spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom and are called matters of doctrine. These latter cognitions are learned in part from the doctrine of faith, in part directly from the Word, and in part 
therefore by a person's own efforts, as is also well known. As long as these matters of doctrine remain solely in the memory they are merely factual truths and have not as yet been made over to the 
individual as his own. They first become made over to him when he starts to love them for the sake of life, and more so when he applies them to life. When this happens truths are raised up from the 
natural memory into the rational part of the mind and are there joined to good. And when they have been joined they are no longer matters of knowledge but of life, for in that case a person is no longer 
learning from truths how to live but actually living by them. In this way truths come to be his own and become matters of the will. He accordingly enters the heavenly marriage, for the heavenly marriage 
consists in good and truth joined together in the rational. With men these things are accomplished by the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But in Himself the Lord did this by Himself, unaided. From the Divine itself 
He not only begot the Rational as regards Good, but also through this the Natural as regards Truth, which He joined to Good. For it is good that chooses truth for itself and also gives form to it, for 
good acknowledges nothing else as truth but that which is compatible with it. Thus Divine good that was the Lord's moulded Truth for itself. Nor did it acknowledge as Truth anything else than that 
which would be compatible with Divine Good, that is, which would be Divine of Itself. Thus He achieved every single thing by His own power. These are the things that are meant by 'acknowledgement that 
it was the Lord's alone' and by 'consent inspired from the Lord'. </p>

`Ecce Rebecca coram te, accipe et vade, et sit mulier filio domini tui, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah': quod significet consensum inspiratum ex Domino, constare etiam potest ab explicatione singularum 
vocum, quarum commune conclusum in sensu interno est hoc. Ipsa res ita se habet: Dominus `cum vixit in mundo, Humanum in Se ex propria potentia Divinum fecit; humanum incohat in intimo rationalis, n. 
2106, 2194; describitur hic quomodo hoc Divinum fecerit, nempe sicut prius quoad bonum, ita nunc quoad verum; rationale enim consistit ex bono et vero; bonum ibi fuit ex ipsissimo Ejus Divino, hoc est, 
ex Jehovah Patre', a Quo conceptus; verum autem comparandum erat per viam ordinariam, sicut apud alios homines: [2] notum enim est quod homo non nascatur rationalis, sed modo in potentiam ut fieri 
possit, et quod fiat per scientifica, nempe per cognitiones plurium generum et specierum, quarum primae sunt media ad proxime sequentes, ita ordine usque ad ultimas, quae sunt spiritualium regni Domini, 
et vocantur doctrinalia; quod haec partim addiscantur ex doctrina fidei, partim immediate ex Verbo, ac inde partim proprio studio, etiam notum est; haec doctrinalia quamdiu solum in memoria sunt, sunt 
modo vera scientifica, nec adhuc appropriata homini tanquam ejus, sed ea tunc primum ei appropriantur cum incipit amare illa propter vitam, et magis cum applicat vitae; hoc cum fit, tunc vera e memoria 
naturali elevantur in rationale, et ibi conjunguntur bono{2}, et cum conjuncta sunt, non amplius sunt scientiae sed vitae, nam tunc non amplius discit homo ex veris quomodo vivendum, sed vivit ex 
illis, ita appropriantur ei vera ac fiunt voluntatis; sic intrat homo in conjugium caeleste; conjugium enim caeleste est conjunctio boni et veri in rationali; {3}haec facit Dominus apud homines.  [3] 
At Dominus in Se ex Se Ipso omnia haec fecit, et ex Ipso Divino non modo genuit Rationale quoad Bonum, sed etiam per hoc, Naturale quoad Verum, quod conjunxit Bono; (m)bonum enim est quod sibi verum 
eligit, et quoque format, nam bonum non aliud pro vero agnoscit quam quod concordat; ita Bonum Divinum quod Domino, sibi ipsi Verum fecit, nec aliud pro Vero agnovit quam quod Divino Bono concordaret, 
hoc est, quod Divinum ex Ipso esset;(n) ita omnia et singula ex propria potentia: haec sunt quae significantur per agnitionem quod solius Domini {4}esset, et per consensum inspiratum (c)ex Domino. @1
