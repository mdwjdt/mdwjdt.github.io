<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5387.</strong>但对应于尿液本身的，是地狱里的人；因为如前所述，尿液已经从血液当中被分离出来，本身无非是被丢弃的不洁且用尽了的血清，故在身体之外。关于这类灵人，我讲述以下细节。一开始，我感觉有一个灵人可以说在我的身体里面，但很快他就到了身体之外，在我的右侧之下。当他在那里立定时，就消失不见了。因为他有能力叫人看不见他。当这被问及某事时，他不答一言。其他人告诉我说，活在肉身时，他曾从事海盗活动；因为在来世，人能从一个人的情感与思维的生命所发出的气场清楚察觉他曾是谁，是哪种人。这事是有可能的，因为每个人的生命都与他同在。<br />这个灵人不断变换位置，时而出现在右侧某个点上，时而出现在左侧某个点上。我发现他这样做是因为害怕人们知道他是谁，并被迫作出某种忏悔。其他灵人告诉我说，像这样的灵人，但凡有一顶点危险，就完全吓破胆；但当危险完全不存在时，他们又浑身是胆，成了最勇敢的人。他们还告诉我说，这类灵人与那些对应于排尿功能的灵人是对立的。他们千方百计削弱这种功能；为叫我没有怀疑的余地，这一点通过经历向我演示了。当对应于排尿功能的灵人稍稍离开，而那个海盗依然在场时，小便完全排不出来；但是，一旦他们被叫回来，小便照他们的同在又通畅了。<br />后来，这个灵人坦承他曾是一名海盗。他说，那时他能巧妙隐藏起来，狡猾而又煞费苦心地逃避追捕他的人。现在，他补充说，他喜欢有尿骚味的污秽之地，尿液的骚臭给予他最大的乐趣，以致他想住在水坑里，甚至住在骚臭的尿桶里。我还被指示看到他有哪种脸。事实上，他根本没有脸，取而代之的是某种发黑、像胡须一样的东西。<br />在此之后，其他一些海盗被传唤来，他们不如第一个海盗那么活跃。这些海盗也几乎一言不发，但说来奇怪，他们却在咬牙切齿。他们同样声称他们喜欢尿液胜过其它任何液体，喜欢污水胜过其它种类的水。然而，不像第一个海盗，他们没有那种取代脸的胡须样的东西，而是有一排排可怕的牙齿，看上去就像板条箱。因为胡须和牙齿表示最低级的属世事物。他们没有脸表示他们没有理性生命，因为当看不到脸时，这标志着内层与大人的对应关系不存在。在来世，对应关系决定了每个人在天堂之光中的模样；因此，地狱里的人都有可怕、丑陋的外表。</p>

They who correspond to the urine itself however are infernal; for as before said the urine is out of the body, because already separated from the blood, and in itself is nothing but unclean and used-up 
serum, which is thrown down. I may relate the following things concerning them. A certain spirit was perceived at first as if within the body, but presently below at the right; and when he stood there, 
he was invisible, having the power to render himself so by art. When he was questioned, he made no reply whatever. It was said by others that in the life of the body he had been engaged in piratical 
pursuits; for in the other life it is plainly perceived, from the sphere of the life's affections and thoughts, who and of what quality everyone has been, because his life remains. [2] He changed 
his place, appearing now at the right, and now at the left. I saw that he did this for fear of its being known who he was, and of being forced to make some confession. It was said by other spirits that 
such are most timorous at the least sign of danger, and most courageous when there is nothing to fear; and that they are the opposite of those to whom the discharge of the urine corresponds, and strive 
in every way to injure this. And that I might have no doubt, it was shown me by experience. When they who correspond to the discharge of the urine withdrew a little, and that pirate stood by, the 
discharge was completely stopped, and effort was attended with danger; but when they were recalled, the emission of the urine was intensified according to their presence.  [3] He afterward confessed 
that he had been a pirate, and said that he could then artfully hide himself, and by cunning and activity elude his pursuers; and that he now loves urinous filth much more than any clear water, and that 
the fetid smell of urine is what most delights him, so much so that he wishes to have his abode in pools, or even in casks, of fetid urine. It was shown also what sort of face he had; it was not really 
a face, but something with a black beard in place of one. [4] Afterward other pirates also, who were not so active, were sent for, who also spoke but little, and strange to say gnashed their teeth. 
They too said that they love urine more than all other liquids, and feculent urine the most. These, however, had not something bearded for a face, as the first had, but a kind of dreadful grate of 
teeth; for the beard and teeth signify the lowest natural things. Their being without a face signifies that they have no rational life, because when no face appears it is a sign that there is no correspondence 
of the interiors with the Grand Man; for in the other life everyone appears in the light of heaven in accordance with his correspondence, and hence the infernals appear in horrible deformity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5387</b></p><p><b>5387.</b>
But the actual ones who correspond to urine are those in the hells, for urine, as stated above, is outside the body because it has already been separated from the blood and essentially is nothing else 
than unclean used fluid that has been cast away. Let the following details be given regarding such spirits. I once felt a certain spirit to be initially inside my body so to speak; but soon after he 
was outside it on my right where, once he had established himself, he could not be seen. For he had the ability to make himself unseen. When asked something he made no reply whatsoever. Others told me 
that during his lifetime he had engaged in piracy, for in the next life one can detect plainly from the sphere emanating from the life of a person's affections and thoughts who and what kind of person 
he has been. This is possible because everyone's life remains with him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This spirit varied his position, appearing at one point on the right, at another on the left. I perceived that he did 
this because of a fear that people would know who he was and that he would be compelled to make some kind of confession. Other spirits told me that those like this one are utterly afraid if there is 
the slightest danger; but when no danger at all exists they are full of courage. They also told me that such spirits are opposed to those to whom the function of expelling urine corresponds. They strive 
in whatever way they can to impair that function; and to remove any doubts I may have had, this was demonstrated to me by experience. When those who corresponded to the function of expelling urine 
departed only a little way off and that pirate was still present, the passing of urine was brought to a complete halt and was also filled with danger. But once they were called back the passing of urine 
was resumed, directed by their presence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 After this that spirit did confess that he had been a pirate. He said he had the ability to conceal himself skillfully, and by being cunning and painstaking 
to mislead his pursuers. Now, he added, he loved foul urinous places, much more than clean waters, and that the disgusting stench of urine gave him the greatest pleasure, so much so that he wanted 
a dwelling-place among pools, even among casks of stinking urine. I was also shown the kind of face he had. Really he had no face at all, but instead of a face something black and bearded.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
After this some other pirates who were less painstaking than this one were summoned. These too hardly said a word, but - which was amazing - were gnashing their teeth. They likewise said they liked 
urine more than any other fluids, and foul waters more than any other kind. These however did not have for a face something bearded, like the first pirate, but a dreadful array of teeth, looking like 
a crate. For the beard and the teeth mean the lowest natural things. The absence of a face means that no rational life at all is present, for when no face is visible this is a sign that no correspondence 
exists of interior things with the Grand Man. In the next life correspondence determines what anyone looks like in the light of heaven, and therefore those in hell have horribly ugly appearances. </p>

Qui autem ipsi urinae correspondent, sunt infernales, nam urina, ut supra dictum, est extra corpus quia separata jamdum a sanguine, ac in se non nisi quam serum immundum et obsoletum {1} quod dejectum; 
de illis sequentia licet referre: quidam spiritus perceptus primum sicut intus in corpore sed mox extra  {2} ad dextrum, ubi cum sistebatur, erat inconspicuus, potuit {3} se arte inconspicuum facere; 
cum interrogabatur, nihil quicquam  tunc respondebat; dicebatur ab aliis quod piratica exercuerit in vita corporis, appercipitur enim manifeste in altera vita a sphaera vitae affectionum et cogitationum 
{4}, quis et qualis fuerat, quia cujusvis vita manet; [2] is variabat locum nunc apparendo ad dextrum nunc ad sinistrum; percepi quod id {5} faceret ex timore ne sciretur quis esset et ne cogeretur 
aliquid fateri; dicebatur ab aliis spiritibus quod tales ad minimum periculi timidissimi sint, et cum nihil periculi animosissimi; et quod tales in opposito sint ad illos quibus ejectio urinae correspondet; 
damnum ei inferre quocumque modo student; et ne dubitarem, per experientiam id ostensum erat; cum illi qui urinae ejectioni correspondebant, se paulo retraherent et ille pirata adesset, sistebatur 
prorsus urinae emissio et quoque revolvebatur cum discrimine, at cum revocabantur, urinae emissio secundum praesentiam intendebatur; [3] quod is pirata fuerit, postea fassus est,  dicens quod 
se dextre occultare potuerit ac versute et industrie fallere insequentes; et quod nunc amet foeda urinosa multum prae aquis limpidis, et quod nidor urinae {6} fetidus sit quo maxime delectatur, adeo 
ut in stagnis, immo in cadis urinae fetidae velit domicilium habere.  Ostensum quoque quali facie  erat, non erat ei facies sed aliquid {7} nigre barbatum loco faciei.  [4] Postea etiam alii piratae 
non ita industrii arcessebantur, illi quoque parum loquebantur, et quod mirum, frendebant dentibus; dicebant etiam illi quod urinas prae omnibus liquidis ament, et faeculentas prae aliis; sed his non 
pro facie erat barbatum quid ut priori, sed dira quaedam dentium crates; barba enim et dentes significant infima naturalia; quod absque facie, significat quod {8} nihil vitae rationalis; nam quod non 
(t)aliqua facies appareat, est signum quod nulla correspondentia sit interiorum cum Maximo Homine, quisque enim apparet in luce caeli in altera vita secundum correspondentiam, inde infernales in horrenda 
deformitate. </p>
