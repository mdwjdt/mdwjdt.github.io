<p><strong>[NCE]1373.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1373/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_31" target=_top>Genesis 11:31</a>. And Terah took Abram his son and Lot son of Haran (son of his son) and Sarai his daughter-in-law (wife of his son Abram), and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan. And they came all the way to Haran and stayed there.<br />These words mean that people who practiced idolatrous worship were taught about the heavenly and spiritual aspects of faith, so that a representative church could therefore come into existence. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1373</b></p><p><b>1373.</b>
Verse 31. And Terah took Abram his son; and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son; and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into 
the land of Canaan; and they came even unto Haran, and stayed there. These words signify that those who had been in idolatrous worship were instructed in the celestial and spiritual things of faith, 
in order that a representative church might come forth from that source. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1373</b></p><p><b>1373.</b>
Verse 31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram his son; and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into 
the land of Canaan. And they came as far as Haran and remained there. These words mean that people whose worship was idolatrous received instruction in the celestial and spiritual things of faith in 
order that from them a representative Church might come into being. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1373</b>
</p><b>1373.</b>
Vers. 31.  Et accepit Terah Abramum filium suum, et Lotum, filium Haranis, filium filii sui, et Sarai nurum suam, uxorem Abrami filii sui; et exiverunt cum illis ex Ur Chaldaeorum, ad eundum in terram 
Canaan; et venerunt usque ad Haran, et manserunt ibi.  Haec significant quod ii qui in cultu idololatrico fuerunt, instruerentur in caelestibus et spiritualibus fidei ut inde Ecclesia Repraesentativa 
existeret. </p>
