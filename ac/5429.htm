<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5429.</strong>创世记42:9-16.约瑟想起从前所作关于他们的梦，就对他们说，你们是奸细，来窥探这地的虚实。他们对他说，我主阿，不是的。你的仆人们是来买粮的。我们都是一个人的儿子，是诚实人。你的仆人们并不是奸细。约瑟对他们说，不然，你们就是来窥探这地虚实的。他们说，你的仆人们本是弟兄十二人，是迦南地一个人的儿子，看哪，最小的今日与我们的父亲在一起，有一个不在了。约瑟对他们说，这正是我向你们讲的，说你们是奸细。我要这样试试你们：我指着法老的性命起誓，若是你们最小的兄弟不到这里来，你们就不得从这里出去。须要打发你们中间一个人去，让他把你们的兄弟带来。至于你们，都要囚在这里，好证验你们的话真不真，若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们一定是奸细。<br />“约瑟想起从前所作关于他们的梦”表属灵层的属天层预见属世层中教会的总体真理将要发生的事。“就对他们说”表由此而来的觉知。“你们是奸细”表它们只为利益而存在。“来窥探这地的虚实”表再没有比自己知道它们不是真理更让他们高兴的了。“他们对他说，我主阿，不是的，我们是诚实人”表真理的确存在于他们里面。“你的仆人们是来买粮的”表它们是要使属世层能通过良善将它们变成它自己的。“我们都是一个人的儿子”表这些真理都有同一个源头。“是诚实人”表因此真理存在于他们里面。“你的仆人们并不是奸细”表所以他们不是为了利益。“约瑟对他们说，不然，你们就是来窥探这地虚实的”表他们不关心它们是不是真理。“他们说，你的仆人们本是弟兄十二人”表信的全部事物以这种方式被联结起来。“是一个人的儿子”表它们拥有同一个源头。“迦南地”表在教会。“看哪，最小的今日与我们的父亲在一起”表它们还被联结于属灵良善。“有一个不在了”表神性属灵层（联结就始于该层）没有出现。“约瑟对他们说”表对这个问题的觉知。“这正是我向你们讲的”表这个问题的真相正如我所思考的。“说你们是奸细”表他们对教会的真理感兴趣是因为利益。“我要这样试试你们”表要看看事情是不是这样。“我指着法老的性命起誓”表一种确定性。“若是你们最小的兄弟不到这里来，你们就不得从这里出去”表你们当中的真理必是这样，除非它们与属灵良善联结。“须要打发你们中间一个人去，让他把你们的兄弟带来”表只要与那良善的某种联结存在。“至于你们，都要囚在这里”表即便其它一切仍是分离的。“好证验你们的话真不真”表这个问题的真相要以这种方式得以证实。“若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们一定是奸细”表否则，可以确定你们只是为了利益而拥有真理。</p>

Verses 9-16. And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. And they said unto him, Nay my lord, but to buy 
food are thy servants come. We are all one man's sons; we are upright; thy servants are no spies. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. And they said, we thy servants 
are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. And Joseph said unto them, This is it that I spoke unto you, 
saying, ye are spies; hereby ye shall be proved; by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and ye shall 
be bound, and your words shall be verified whether there be truth with you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. "And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed of them," signifies 
that the celestial of the spiritual foresaw what would happen in regard to the general truths of the church in the natural; "and said unto them" signifies perception thence; "Ye are spies" signifies 
that they came only to seek gain; "to see the nakedness of the land ye are come," signifies that they would like nothing better than to know in themselves that there are no truths; "and they said unto 
him, Nay my lord, we are upright," signifies that they are truths in themselves; "but to buy food are thy servants come," signifies that they are to be appropriated to the natural by means of good; 
"we are all one man's sons," signifies that these truths are from one origin; "we are upright," signifies that thus they are truths in themselves; "thy servants are no spies," signifies that therefore 
it was not for the sake of gain; "and he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come" signifies that they do not care whether there are truths; "and they said, We thy servants 
are twelve brethren," signifies that all things of faith were thus conjoined together; "the sons of one man," signifies from one origin; "in the land of Canaan," signifies in the church; "and behold 
the youngest is this day with our father," signifies that there was also conjunction with spiritual good; "and one is not" signifies that the Divine spiritual from which it is does not appear; and Joseph 
said unto them," signifies perception concerning that matter; "This is it that I spoke unto you" signifies that the truth is as I thought; "saying, ye are spies," signifies that they are in the 
truths of the church for the sake of gain; "hereby ye shall be proved," signifies it will be seen whether it is so; "by the life of Pharaoh," signifies of a certainty; "ye shall not go forth hence, except 
your youngest brother come hither," signifies that it must needs be that the truths with you are such, unless they are conjoined with spiritual good; "send one of you, and let him get your brother," 
signifies if only there is some conjunction with that good; "and ye shall be bound," signifies even though there is separation in all other respects; "and your words shall be verified, whether there 
be truth with you," signifies that it will then be so; "or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies," signifies otherwise it is certain that you have truths only for the sake of gain. </p>

Verses 9-16 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed involving them; and he said to them, You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land. And they said to him, No, my lord; 
and your servants come to buy food. All we, the sons of one man are we. We are upright men; your servants are not spies. And he said to them, No, but the nakedness of the land you have come to see. 
And they said, Twelve are your servants, brothers are we, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is not. And Joseph said to them, It is as 
I spoke to you, saying, You are spies. In this manner you will be tested: As sure as Pharaoh lives,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> you shall not go out of here unless your youngest brother comes here. Send one of you and let him 
fetch your brother; and you will be in bonds, and your words will be tested, whether the truth is with you. And if not, as sure as Pharaoh lives,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> you are spies. </p>
<p>'And Joseph remembered the dreams 
which he had dreamed involving them' means that the celestial of the spiritual foresaw what was to happen to the general truths known to the Church in the natural. 'And he said to them' means the consequent 
perception. 'You are spies' means that they existed solely for the sake of gain. 'You have come to see the nakedness of the land' means that nothing would please them more than to know for themselves 
that they are not truths. 'And they said to him, No, sir, we are upright men'<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> means that truths are indeed present within them. 'And your servants come to buy food' means that they are present 
to enable the natural to make them its own by means of good. 'All we, the sons of one man are we' means that those truths all have the same origin. 'We are upright men' means that truths are accordingly 
present within them. 'Your servants are not spies' means that thus they are not there for the sake of gain. 'And he said to them, No, but the nakedness of the land you have come to see' means that 
they do not care whether they are truths. 'And they said, Twelve are your servants, brothers are we' means that all aspects of faith exist joined together in this manner. 'The sons of one man' means 
that they have the same origin. 'In the land of Canaan' means in the Church. 'And behold, the youngest is with our father today' means that they are also joined to spiritual good. 'And one is not' means 
that the Divine spiritual from which [the joining together begins] is not apparent. 'And Joseph said to them' means perception regarding that matter. 'It is as I spoke to you' means that the truth 
of the matter is as I thought. 'Saying, You are spies' means that they are interested in the truths known to the Church for the sake of gain. 'In this manner you will be tested' means it will be seen 
whether this is so. 'As sure as Pharaoh lives' means a certainty. 'You shall not go out of here unless your youngest brother comes here' means that truths with you cannot help being such unless these 
have been joined to spiritual good. 'Send one of you and let him fetch your brother' means provided that some kind of joining to that good exists. 'And you will be in bonds' means if all else is still 
separated. 'And your words will be tested, whether the truth is with you' means that in this way the fact of the matter will be established. 'And if not, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are spies' means 
otherwise it is certain that truths exist with you solely for the sake of gain.

Vers. 9-16.  Et recordatus Joseph somniorum quae somniavit illis, et dixit ad illos, Exploratores vos, ad videndum nuditatem terrae venistis. Et dixerunt ad eum, Non domine mi, et servi tui veniunt 
ad emendum cibum. Omnes nos filii viri unius nos, recti nos, non sunt servi tui exploratores. Et dixit ad illos, Non, quod nuditatem terrae venistis ad videndum. Et dixerunt, Duodecim servi tui fratres 
nos, filii viri unius in terra Canaan, et ecce minimus cum patre nostro hodie, et unus non est. Et dixit ad illos Joseph, Hoc quod locutus ad vos, dicendo, exploratores vos. In hoc probabimini, vivat 
Pharaoh, si exibitis exhinc nisi in venire frater vester, minimus huc. Mittite e vobis unum, et accipiat fratrem vestrum, et vos vinciemini, et probabuntur verba vestra, an veritas cum vobis, et si 
non, vivat Pharaoh, quod exploratores vos. `Et recordatus Joseph somniorum quae somniavit illis' significat quod caeleste spiritualis praevideret quid contingeret de veris communibus Ecclesiae in naturali: 
`et dixit ad illos' significat perceptionem inde: `exploratores vos' significat quod solum ad captandum lucrum: `ad videndum nuditatem terrae venistis' significat quod nihil potius illis quam sibi 
scire quod non vera sint:  `et dixerunt ad eum, Non domine {1}mi' significat quod vera sint in se: `et servi tui veniunt ad emendum cibum' significat quod sit ad appropriandum naturali per bonum: omnes 
nos filii viri unius nos' significat quod vera illa ex una origine sint: `recti nos' significat quod ita vera in se: `non sunt servi tui exploratores' significat quod sic non propter lucrum: `et 
dixit ad illos, Non, quod nuditatem terrae venistis ad videndum' significat quod illis non curae num vera sint: `et dixerunt, Duodecim servi tui fratres nos' significat quod omnia fidei simul {2}ita conjuncta: 
`filii viri unius' significat ex una origine: `in terra Canaan' significat in Ecclesia: `et ecce minimus cum patre nostro hodie' significat quod etiam conjunctio cum bono spirituali: `et unus 
non est' significat quod Divinum spirituale, a quo non appareat: `et dixit ad illos Joseph' significat perceptionem de illa re: `Hoc quod locutus ad vos' significat quod verum sit sicut cogitavi: `dicendo, 
exploratores vos' significat quod in Ecclesiae veris propter lucrum: `in hoc probabimini' significat num ita sit, videbitur: `vivat Pharaoh' significat certum: `si exibitis exhinc nisi in venire 
frater vester minimus huc' significat quod non possit aliter quam quod vera apud vos sint talia, nisi conjuncta sint bono spirituali: `mittite e vobis unum, et accipiat fratrem vestrum' significat 
si modo conjunctio sit aliqua cum bono illo: `et vos vinciemini' significat  tametsi in ceteris adhuc separatio: `et probabuntur verba vestra, an  veritas cum vobis' significat quod tunc ita existet: 
`et si non, vivat  Pharaoh, quod exploratores vos' significat alias certum, quod vera vobis solum lucri causa. </p>
