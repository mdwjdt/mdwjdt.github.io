<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8794节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8794.</strong>“你要在四围给百姓定界限”表向天堂的延伸不超过良善的属灵气场。这从“在四围定界限”的含义和以色列人的代表清楚可知：“在四围定界限”是指向天堂的气场延伸，延伸到由每个人的良善所决定的某种限度；此处“百姓”所指的以色列人是指那些处于真理所要植入的属灵良善之人。因为本章和接下来的章节描述了那些属于属灵教会之人的这种良善状态（参看<a href="8753.htm">8753</a>节）。正因如此，“你要在四围给百姓定界限”表示向天堂的延伸不超过良善的属灵气场。<br />若不通过启示，没有人知道何谓“向天堂的延伸直到良善的属灵气场”。此中情形是这样：通过被主重生而赋予一个人的一切良善皆延伸到天堂社群。这种延伸的量和质因各人而异；随着它走向天堂更远的边界，它在量上发生变动；随着它更加转移到天堂的内层，或更加转移到天堂的外层，它在质上发生变动。与人同住的良善本身从主经由周围的天堂社群流入；不经由这些社群流入的良善是不可能的。天堂社群存在于周围，紧密相连、接连不断；任何地方都看不到它们之间的中断。与良善有关并构成其本质的每一个事物也一样。因此，在一个人重生期间，其良善的丰富无非是被引入天使天堂，以这种方式与他们结合（参看<a href="4067.htm">4067</a>，<a href="4073.htm">4073</a>，<a href="4077.htm">4077</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6613.htm">6613</a>节）。<br />这一点也曾通过活生生的经历频繁向我证明了。与某些社群的接触从我这里被撤出，然后剩余生命的量和质便取决于延伸到剩余社群的量和质。当更多社群被拿走时，我的生命遭受痛苦，似乎开始被掐灭。每个天使、灵人和世人都有一个属灵气场，其性质取决于它向不同社群的延伸。这种延伸不会进入社群本身，而是进入它们的良善所发出的气场。这些事都是世人所不知的奥秘，但在来世却是众所周知的。它们不为世人所知的原因是，如今的人以为他拥有生命在自己里面，因而以为他的生命与灵人并天使没有联系，与天堂没有联结。但在这一点上，他完全错了；因为一个人的一切生命皆通过灵界的社群来自主。<br />要进一步知道，那些属于属灵教会的人所发出的生命能到达第二层天堂，也就是所谓的属灵天堂的天使气场，但到不了属天人所在的第三层天堂。这是因为，属灵教会成员不能接受诸如存在于属天人所在的至内层或第三层天堂的那种神性，除非以一种如此笼统的方式，以致他甚至没有注意到它。原因在于，属灵人甚至不能到达属天人所处良善的第一道门槛（<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="6500.htm">6500</a>，<a href="8521.htm">8521</a>节）。由此明显可知当如何理解“你要在四围给百姓定界限”所表示的“向天堂的延伸不超过良善的属灵气场”；又当如何理解接下来的话。<br />还要知道的是，正如那些处于良善的人照其良善的质和量而拥有向天使社群的延伸，那些陷入邪恶的人也照其邪恶的质和量而拥有向地狱社群的延伸。此外，在来世，每个人都会来到他活在肉身期间就与之接触的那些人中间。他的主导爱决定了这一点，因为这爱构成每个人的生命所发出的气场，并照其质和量而延伸。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8794</b></p><p><b>8794.</b>
And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about. That this signifies extension into heaven no further than to the spiritual spheres of good, is evident from the signification of "setting bounds round 
about," as being the extension of the sphere into heaven to certain limits, which are determined by the good of each person; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are "the people" 
here spoken of, as being those who are in the spiritual good in which truth is to be implanted; for this state of the good of those who are of the spiritual church is described in this and the following 
chapters (see n. 8753). Hence it is that by "thou shalt set bounds to the people round about" is signified an extension into heaven no further than to the spiritual spheres of good. 
 </p>
<p>[2] What is 
meant by "extension into heaven to the spiritual spheres of good" cannot be known to anyone except by revelation. The case herein is this. All the good which is given to man through regeneration from 
the Lord has extension to societies in heaven. This extension differs as to amount and quality with each person; as to amount when to more remote limits; as to quality, when more to the interiors or more 
to the exteriors of heaven. Good itself with man flows in from the Lord through the societies of heaven which are round about; good without influx through societies not being possible. The societies 
of heaven are in continuous connection round about, and nowhere is there seen a discontinuity. It is the same with each and all things that pertain to good, and constitute its quality. Wherefore during 
man's regeneration, the enriching of good is nothing else than insinuation into angelic societies, and thus conjunction with them (see also n. 4067, 4073, 4077, 6598-6613).
 </p>
<p>[3] This has also been 
frequently shown by living experience; for sometimes the communications with certain societies have been taken away, and then so much of life and such a quality of life remained, as was the degree and 
quality of extension into the remaining societies; and when more societies were taken away, then the life labored, and began as it were to be extinguished. Every angel, spirit, and man has a spiritual 
sphere, and this according to his extension into societies. This extension is not into the societies themselves, but into the spheres of their good. These are secrets which are unknown to man, but 
in the other life are very well known. The reason why they are unknown to man is that at this day he believes that he has life in himself, and consequently that he lives without consociation with spirits 
and angels, thus without conjunction with heaven; but in this he is quite mistaken, for all the life of man is from the Lord through societies.
 </p>
<p>[4] Be it further known that the extension of the 
life of those who are of the spiritual church is to the angelic spheres in the second heaven, which is called the spiritual heaven; but not to the third heaven where the celestial are. The reason is that 
the men of the spiritual church cannot receive the Divine such as it is in the inmost or third heaven where the celestial are, except so generally that it does not at all come to their perception; 
because the spiritual cannot come even to the first threshold of the good in which the celestial are (n. 2718, 3833, 6500, 8521). From all this it is evident what is meant by extension into heaven no 
further than to the spiritual spheres of good, which is signified by "thou shalt set bounds to the people round about;" also what is meant by what follows. 
 </p>
<p>[5] Be it also known that as they who are 
in good have extension into angelic societies according to the quality and amount of their good, so they who are in evil have extension into infernal societies according to the quality and amount of their 
evil; and further, that everyone in the other life comes among those with whom he had communicated in the life of the body. His ruling love determines this, for it is this love which constitutes 
the sphere of everyone's life, and extends itself according to its quality and according to its amount. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8794</b></p><p><b>8794.</b>
'And you are to set bounds for the people round about' means not extending into heaven beyond the spiritual spheres of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'setting bounds round about' as the extension 
of a sphere into heaven to specific limits that are determined by each one's good; and from the representation of the children of Israel, to whom 'the people' refers here, as those governed by spiritual 
good in which truth is to be implanted. For this state of the good of those belonging to the spiritual Church is described in the present chapter and in those that follow it, <a href="8753.htm">8753</a>. So it is that 
'you are to set bounds for the people round about' means extension into heaven no further than to the spiritual spheres of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 No one can know except from revelation what to understand by 
extension into heaven as far as the spiritual spheres of good. The situation is this: Any good imparted to a person through regeneration by the Lord extends itself to communities in heaven. The amount 
and the nature of this extension varies with each person; it varies in amount as it advances towards more distant boundaries in heaven, and in nature as it shifts more towards the internal parts of 
heaven or more towards the external parts. The actual good residing with a person flows in from the Lord by way of the communities of heaven that are round about; good that does not flow in by way of 
those communities is not possible. The communities of heaven exist round about, closely joined together without a break; not a break between them appears anywhere. It is the same with every single thing 
that is connected with good and constitutes its essential nature. Therefore when a person is being regenerated his enrichment in good is nothing other than being introduced into angelic communities, 
and in this way being joined to them. See also <a href="4067.htm">4067</a>, <a href="4073.htm">4073</a>, <a href="4077.htm">4077</a>, <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6613.htm">6613</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This has also been demonstrated to me quite a number of times by actual experience. Sometimes contact with certain communities 
has been withdrawn from me, and then the amount and the nature of life that remained were determined by the amount and nature of extension into the communities that were left. And when more 
communities were taken away, my life suffered and began seemingly to be snuffed out. Every angel, spirit, and man has a spiritual sphere, and its nature is determined by its extension into different 
communities. It extends not into the actual communities, but into the spheres emanating from their good. These matters are arcana that are unknown to anyone in the world but are very well known indeed 
in the next life. The reason why they are unknown to anyone in the world is that a person at the present day believes that he has life in himself, and consequently that he lives without association with 
spirits and angels, and so without being linked to heaven. But in this he is altogether mistaken; for all the life a person has comes from the Lord by way of communities [in the spiritual world]. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In addition it should be recognized that the life emanating from those belonging to the spiritual Church reaches as far as the angelic spheres in the second heaven, called the spiritual heaven, 
but not as far as the third heaven, where those who are celestial are. The reason for this is that a member of the spiritual Church cannot receive the Divine as He exists in the inmost or third heaven 
where those who are celestial are, except in so general a way that he does not even notice it. And the reason for this is that those who are spiritual cannot reach even the outer doorstep of the good 
governing those who are celestial, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, <a href="6500.htm">6500</a>, <a href="8521.htm">8521</a>. All this shows what should be understood by not extending into heaven beyond the spiritual spheres of good, meant by the injunction 'you are 
to set bounds for the people round about', and also what should be understood by the words that follow it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It should also be recognized that just as those governed by good have an extension into 
angelic communities according to the nature and amount of their good, so those ruled by evil have an extension into hellish communities according to the nature and amount of their evil. And in addition 
to this, everyone in the next life comes among those with whom he had been in contact during his lifetime. His ruling love determines this; for that love is what constitutes the sphere emanating 
from each person's life, and extends as far as the nature and amount of it determine. </p>

</p><b>8794.</b>
`Et terminos ponas populo circumcirca': quod significet extensionem in caelum non ultra quam ad sphaeras spirituales boni, constat ex significatione `terminos ponere circumcirca' quod sit extensio sphaerae 
in caelum ad certos limites, qui sunt determinati bono cujusvis, et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' qui hic sunt `populus,' quod sint qui in bono spirituali cui implantandum est verum; 
hic enim status boni illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, in hoc capite et in sequentibus describitur, n. 8753; inde est quod per `terminos ponas populo circumcirca' significetur extensio in caelum 
non ultra quam ad sphaeras spirituales boni. 	2 Quid per extensionem in (x)caelum ad sphaeras spirituales boni intelligitur, non sciri ab aliquo quam per revelationem {1}potest; hoc ita se habet: 
omne bonum quod datur homini per regenerationem a Domino habet extensionem ad societates in caelo; extensio illa differt quoad quantum et quale apud unumquemvis; quoad quantum cum ad terminos remotiores, 
quoad quale cum magis ad interiora vel magis ad exteriora caeli; ipsum bonum apud hominem influit a Domino per societates caeli quae circumcirca, bonum absque influxu per societates non datur; sunt 
societates caeli in continua cohaerentia circumcirca, nec alicubi apparet discontinuum; similiter se habet cum omnibus et singulis quae sunt boni, et constituunt quale ejus; quapropter cum regeneratur 
homo, locupletatio boni non aliud est quam insinuatio in societates angelicas, et sic cum illis conjunctio, videatur etiam n. 4067, 4073, 4077, 6598-6613. 	3 {2}Hoc quoque per vivam experientiam 
pluries (t)ostensum est; quandoque enim communicatio cum societatibus quibusdam ablatae sunt, et tunc tantum vitae et tale vitae remansit quantum et quale extensionis fuit in residuas societates; et cum 
plures societates ademptae sunt, tunc vita laboravit, et quasi exstingui coepit; unicuique angelo, spiritui, et homini, est sphaera spiritualis, et haec secundum extensionem ejus in societates; extensio 
illa non est in ipsas societates, sed {3}in sphaeras boni illorum; haec sunt arcana quae {4}ignota sunt homini sed in altera vita notissima; causa quod ignota sint homini, est quia homo hodie credit 
quod vita ei sit in ipso, et inde quod vivat absque consociatione cum spiritibus et angelis, ita absque conjunctione cum caelo; sed in hoc prorsus fallitur, omnis enim vita hominis est a Domino per 
societates. 	4 Porro sciendum quod extensio vitae illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sit ad sphaeras angelicas in caelo secundo, quod caelum spirituale vocatur, non autem ad caelum tertium ubi caelestes; 
causa est quia homo Ecclesiae spiritualis non recipere potest Divinum quale est in caelo intimo seu tertio ubi caelestes, solum ita communiter ut ad nullam illorum perceptionem veniat; causa est 
quia spirituales ne quidem ad primum limen boni in quo sunt caelestes, venire possunt, n. 2718, 3833, 6500, 8521; ex his patet quid intelligitur per extensionem in caelum non ultra quam ad sphaeras 
spirituales boni, quae significantur per quod `terminos ponas populo circumcirca,' tum quid intelligitur per sequentia. 	5 Sciendum quoque est quod sicut illi qui in bono sunt extensionem habeant in 
societates {5}angelicas secundum boni illorum quale et quantum, ita illi qui in malo extensionem habent in societates infernales secundum mali illorum quale et quantum; et porro, quod unusquisque in 
altera vita inter illos veniat cum quibus communicaverat in vita corporis; amor ejus dominans id determinat, nam ille est (x)qui constituit sphaeram vitae cujusvis, et se extendit secundum quale suum 
et secundum quantum suum. 	@1 Before quam$ 	@2 quod etiam$ 	@3 ad$ 	@4 hactenus ignota sunt in mundo, sed in altera vita unicuique sunt cognita, homo enim$ 	@5 coelestes$ </p>
