<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9966节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9966.</strong>“这要为亚伦和他以后的种作一个时代的律例”表代表性教会中的秩序律法。这从“一个时代的律例”的含义清楚可知，“一个时代的律例”是指天堂和教会里的一种神性秩序的律法（参看<a href="7884.htm">7884</a>，<a href="7995.htm">7995</a>，<a href="8357.htm">8357</a>节）。之所以说“代表性教会”，是因为代表内在事物的敬拜的外在事物（<a href="8972.htm">8972</a>节），因而那些作为教会代表的事物被称为“律例”。由于所代表的内在事物是神性，因而是永恒的，故经上说“一个时代的律例”；因为“一个时代”表示永恒之物。<br />我所看见的星空中的第二个星球</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9966</b></p><p><b>9966.</b>
It is a statute of an age to him and to his seed after him. That this signifies the laws of order in the representative church, is evident from the signification of "a statute of an age," as being a 
law of Divine order in the heavens and in the church (see n. 7884, 7995, 8357). It is said "in the representative church," because the external things of worship which represented internal things were 
called "statutes" (n. 8972), thus those things which were representatives of the church; and because the internal things which were represented were Divine, thus eternal, therefore it is said, "a statute 
of an age;" for by "an age" is signified what is eternal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9966</b></p><p><b>9966.</b>
'It shall be the statute of an age for him and his seed after him' means laws of order in the representative Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the statute of an age' as a law of Divine order 
in heaven and in the Church, dealt with in <a href="7884.htm">7884</a>, <a href="7995.htm">7995</a>, <a href="8357.htm">8357</a>. The reason for saying 'in the representative Church' is that 'statutes' was the term given to outward forms of worship which represented inner 
realities, <a href="8972.htm">8972</a>, thus which were the things of the Church that were representative. And since the inner realities which were represented were Divine, and so eternal, the words 'the statute of an 
age' are used; for 'an age' means something eternal.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9966</b>
</p><b>9966.</b>
`Statutum saeculi ei et semini ejus post illum': quod significet leges ordinis in Ecclesia repraesentativa, constat ex significatione `statuti saeculi' quod sit lex ordinis Divini in caelis et in Ecclesia, 
de qua n. 7884, 7995, 8357; in Ecclesia repraesentativa dicitur, quia statuta dicebantur externa cultus quae repraesentabant interna, n. 8972, ita quae erant Ecclesiae repraesentativa; et quia 
interna quae repraesentabantur erant Divina, ita aeterna, ideo dicitur statutum saeculi, per saeculum enim significatur aeternum. </p>
