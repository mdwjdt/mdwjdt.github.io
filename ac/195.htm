<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第195节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>195.</strong>上古之人不是将人的情绪、思想比作牲畜、鸟类而已，而是直接以此相称。这是他们惯常的言说方式，延续到洪水后的古教会，甚至旧约时代的先知。人的感官，他们称之为“蛇”，因为感官贴近肉体，正如蛇贴近地面。<br />以感官印象推导信的奥秘，因而被他们称为“蛇的毒气”，推导者则被称为“蛇”。他们以感官，亦即尘世属物质属肉体的可见之物来作推导，故经上说：“蛇比田间一切的活物更狡猾”。又如：“他们使舌头尖利如蛇，嘴里有虺蛇的毒气。”也是指那些以理论误导人的。<br />再如：“恶人一离母腹，便走错路，说谎话。他们的毒气，好像蛇的毒气，他们好像塞耳的聋虺，不听行法术的声音。虽用极灵的咒语，也是不听。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗58.3.htm">58:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗58.6.htm">6</a>）在此，基于感官的推理被称为“蛇的毒气”，使人不听智者之言。古人因此有一句谚语，叫“毒蛇塞耳”。<br />再如：“景况好像人躲避狮子又遇见熊，或是进房屋以手靠墙，就被蛇咬。耶和华的日子，不是黑暗没有光明吗？不是幽暗毫无光辉吗？”（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.19.htm">5:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.20.htm">20</a>）“以手靠墙”表自己的能力，此处描述的是因信赖感官而导致的盲目。<br />再如：“其中的声音好像蛇行一样，敌人要成队而来，如砍伐树木的手拿斧子攻击他。耶和华说，埃及的树林虽然不能寻察，敌人却要砍伐，因他们多于蝗虫，不可胜数。埃及的女子必然蒙羞，必交在北方人的手中。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.22.htm">46:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.24.htm">24</a>）<br />“埃及”表以感官和知识推导神的奥秘。这种推理被称为“蛇的声音”，由此导致的盲目被称为“北方人”。<br />再如：“他必吸饮虺蛇的毒气，蝮蛇的舌头也必杀他。流奶与蜜之河，他不得再见。”（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯20.16.htm">20:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯20.17.htm">17</a>）“流奶与蜜之河”指属灵属天之物，推理者不得看见。他们的推理，被称为“虺蛇的毒气”、“蝮蛇的舌头”。关于蛇，更多可见下文（14-15的诠释）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]195.</strong> The earliest people did not compare various human traits to animals and birds but called them such. That was their manner of speaking. This practice persisted in the ancient church, which came after the Flood, and the [Old Testament] prophets perpetuated it.<br />Snakes was their word for a person's sensory abilities. This was because sense impressions rise directly out of the body, just as snakes lie directly on the ground. Those people referred to false logic concerning the mysteries of faith, when it sprang from sense impressions, as snake venom, and they called the logicians themselves snakes. People who employ this kind of logic spend much time constructing arguments based on things they can sense and specifically on things they can see — things of the earth, their body, the world, and nature — and that is why the snake was described as being crafty above every wild animal of the field.<br />[2] David uses similar words:<br />They sharpen their tongue like a snake; the venom of an asp is on their lips. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_140_3" target=_top>Psalms 140:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_140_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_140_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />This speaks of people who beguile others with their false reasoning. In the same author:<br />They go astray from the womb, speaking a lie; they have venom like the venom of a snake. Like a deaf poison asp, they stop up their ear so as not to hear the voice of those who murmur, of a sage who associates in societies.{*1} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_58_3" target=_top>Psalms 58:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_58_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_58_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />The snake venom refers to specious arguments, which tend to prevent people from even listening to anything wise — the "voice of a sage." That is the source of a customary saying among the ancients that a snake would stop up its ear.{*2} In Amos:<br />... as if you come into the house and lean your hand on the wall and a snake bites you. Is the day of Jehovah not shadow and lack of light? And is there not darkness and lack of radiance on it? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_19-20" target=_top>Amos 5:19-20</a>)<br />The hand on the wall stands for our independent powers and for confidence in the evidence of our senses. These cause blindness, as described.<br />[3] In Jeremiah:<br />The sound of Egypt will travel like a snake, because they will travel in strength and come with axes against her, as if they were woodcutters. "Let them cut down her forest," says Jehovah, "because it will not be explored. For they have become more numerous than locusts and there is no counting them. The daughter of Egypt has been shamed; she will be delivered into the hand of the people of the north." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 46:20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_22-23" target=_top>22-23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_24" target=_top>24</a>)<br />Egypt stands for sophistry about divine subjects based on physical sensation and factual knowledge. Sophistic arguments are called the sound of a snake, and the blindness that results is symbolized by the people of the north. In Job:<br />They will suck the venom of asps; the tongue of a viper will kill them. They will not see torrents, streaming rivers of honey and butter. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_job_20_16-17" target=_top>Job 20:16-17</a>)<br />Rivers of honey and butter are spiritual and heavenly qualities, which reasoners "will not see." Their arguments are called the venom of asps and the tongue of a viper. For more on the meaning of a snake, see below at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_242" target=_top>242-251</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_254" target=_top>254</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_257" target=_top>257-259</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "of a sage who associates in societies," sociantis sodalitia sapientis, may aim to retain the hypnotic effect of both the alliteration and the obscurity of the Hebrew original: חוֹבֵר‭ ‬חֲבָרִים‭ ‬מְחֻכָּם (ḥôḇēr ḥăḇārîm mǝḥukkām). On the asp stopping its ear, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195" target=_top>195</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} The idea that snakes can be charmed and pacified by certain types of speech, song, or instrumental music dates back to ancient times. Snakes were said to make themselves resistant to being thus charmed by stopping up their ears. See, for example, the statement in a commentary of church father Augustine (354-430) on <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_57_5" target=_top>Psalms 57:5</a> in the Vulgate Latin Bible (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_psalms_58_6" target=_top>Psalms 58:6</a> in English Bibles), the same passage Swedenborg addresses here. In Augustine's report of the attempts of one of the Marsi (the ancient magicians and snake-charmers of central Italy) to charm a snake out of its cave, he notes: "It is said that when the snake is unwilling to come out, it presses one ear to the ground and stops the other ear with its tail in order not to hear the words by which it feels itself being compelled" (Augustine Enarrationes in Psalmos 57.7; translation by JSR). On the general notion that some serpents are able to resist being charmed, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_8_17" target=_top>Jeremiah 8:17</a>.

The most ancient people did not compare all things in man to beasts and birds, but so denominated them; and this their customary manner of speaking remained even in the Ancient Church after the flood, 
and was preserved among the prophets. The sensuous things in man they called "serpents" because as serpents live close to the earth, so sensuous things are those next the body. Hence also reasonings 
concerning the mysteries of faith, founded on the evidence of the senses, were called by them the "poison of a serpent" and the reasoners themselves "serpents;" and because such persons reason much from 
sensuous, that is, from visible things (such as are things terrestrial, corporeal, mundane, and natural), it is said that "the serpent was more subtle than any wild animal of the field."  [2] And 
so in David, speaking of those who seduce man by reasonings: </p>
<p>     They sharpen their tongue like a serpent; the poison of the asp is under their lips (Ps. 140:3). And again: </p>
<p>     They go astray from 
the womb, speaking a lie. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, like the deaf poisonous asp that stoppeth her ear, that she may not hear the voice of the mutterers, of a wise one that charmeth 
charms [sociantis sodalitia]* (Ps. 58:3-6). Reasonings that are of such a character that the men will not even hear what a wise one says, or the voice of the wise, are here called the "poison of 
a serpent." Hence it became a proverb among the ancients, that "The serpent stoppeth the ear." In Amos: </p>
<p>     As if a man came into a house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. Shall 
not the day of Jehovah be darkness and not light? even thick darkness, and no brightness in it? (Amos 5:19-20). The "hand on the wall" means self-derived power, and trust in sensuous things, whence 
comes the blindness which is here described. [3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The voice of Egypt shall go like a serpent, for they shall go in strength, and shall come to her with axes as hewers of wood. They 
shall cut down her forest, saith Jehovah, because it will not be searched; for they are multiplied more than the locust, and are innumerable. The daughter of Egypt is put to shame; she shall be delivered 
into the hand of the people of the north (Jer. 46:22-24). "Egypt" denotes reasoning about Divine things from sensuous things and memory-knowledges [scientifica]. Such reasonings are called the "voice 
of a serpent;" and the blindness thereby occasioned, the "people of the north." In Job: </p>
<p>     He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue shall slay him. He shall not see the brooks, the 
flowing rivers of honey and butter (Job 20:16-17). "Rivers of honey and butter" are things spiritual and celestial, which cannot be seen by mere reasoners; reasonings are called the "poison of the 
asp" and the "viper's tongue." See more respecting the serpent below, at verses 14 and 15. * In the Apocalypse Revealed (n. 462e), instead of sociatis sodalitia, there is incantatoris incantationum.

The most ancient people did not compare all things in man to beasts and birds but actually called them such. This was their manner of speaking, which also remained throughout in the Ancient Church after 
the Flood; and a similar manner of speaking was preserved among the Prophets. Man's sensory powers they called serpents, for just as serpents are next to the ground so do the sensory powers come next 
to the body. Consequently reasonings based on sensory evidence concerning mysteries of faith they called serpent-poisons, and those who reasoned in that way they called serpents. And it is their basing 
reasonings so much on sensory evidence - that is, on visual, as is the evidence of earthly, bodily, worldly, and natural objects - that is the reason for the statement 'the serpent was subtle, more 
than every wild animal of the field'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A similar usage occurs in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
They make their tongue sharp, like a serpent. Under their lips is the poison of an asp. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20140:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 140:3-5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to people who mislead a person by means of reasonings. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
They go astray even from the womb, in uttering what is untrue; their poison is like serpent's poison; they are like the 
poisonous deaf-adder which stops up its ear to the sound of those whispering[to it], of the wise one who belongs to the fraternity [of charmers]. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2058:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 58:3-5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Reasonings whose nature is such that 
those who resort to them do not even hear that which is wise, that is, do not hear 'the sound of the wise one', are here called 'serpent's poison'. This was the origin of the popular saying with the 
ancients about 'the serpent stopping its ear'. In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
As if someone went into the house and leaned with his hand against the wall, and a serpent bit him. Is not the day of Jehovah darkness and not 
light, and thick darkness, and no brightness in it? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:19, 20</a>.   
</blockquote>
'His hand against the wall' stands for power that is one's own and trust in sensory evidence, which results in the benightedness 
described here.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The sound of Egypt will go forth like a serpent, for [her enemies] will go forth in force, and they will come to her with axes, like woodcutters. Let them cut 
down her forest, says Jehovah, for it will not be explored; they are more numerous than locusts, they are without number. The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame; she will be given into the hand 
of a people from the north. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:20,%2022-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:20, 22-24</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Egypt' stands for reasoning about Divine matters that is based on sensory evidence and factual knowledge. Reasonings are called 'the sound of a serpent', 
and the benightedness that results is meant by 'a people from the north'. In Job,  </p>
<blockquote>
He will suck the poison of asps, the tongue of a viper will kill him; he will not see the brooks, the streams 
flowing with honey and butter. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2020:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 20:16, 17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Streams of honey and butter' are spiritual and celestial things, which reasoners will not see. Reasonings are called 'the poison of asps and 'the 
tongue of a viper'. For more concerning the serpent, see at verses 14, 15, below.  </p>

Antiquissimi non compararunt omnia quae erant in homine, bestiis et avibus, sed vocarunt; talis erat loquela eorum; talis etiam permansit in Antiqua Ecclesia post diluvium, et similis conservata apud 
Prophetas: sensualia hominis vocabant 'serpentes'; quia, sicut serpentes proximi sunt terrae, etiam sensualia proxima corpori; inde ratiocinia ex sensualibus de mysteriis fidei vocabant 'venena serpentis'; 
et ipsos ratiocinatores 'serpentes'; qui quia ex sensualibus, seu visibilibus, ut sunt terrestria, corporea, mundana et naturalia, multum ratiocinantur, dictum, quod 'serpens fuit astutus prae 
omni fera agri.' Apud Davidem similiter, Exacuunt linguam suam, sicut serpens, venenum aspidis sub labiis eorum, Ps. cxl 4-6 [A.V. 3-5]; ubi de iis qui per ratiocinia seducunt hominem, agitur: apud 
eundem, Aberrant ab utero loquentes mendacium; venenum iis instar veneni serpentis; sicut aspis venenata surda obturat aurem suam, ut non audiat vocem mussitantium, {1} sociantis sodalitia sapientis, 
Ps. lviii 4-6 [A.V. 3-5]; </p>
<p>ratiocinia hic vocantur 'venenum serpentis,' quae sunt talia ut ne quidem audiant quod sapiens, seu vocem sapientis; inde formula apud antiquos quod 'serpens obturet aurem:' 
apud Amosum, Sicut quis veniat in domum, nitaturque manu sua super parietem, et mordeat eum serpens; nonne tenebrae dies Jehovae, et non lux, et caligo, et non splendor ei? v 19, 20; </p>
<p>'manus super 
parietem' pro potentia propria et fiducia sensualium, inde occaecatio quae describitur: apud Jeremiam, Vox Aegypti quasi serpens ibit, quia in robore ibunt, et cum securibus venient ei, tanquam caesores 
lignorum: excidant silvam ejus, dictum Jehovae, quia non investigabitur, nam multiplicati sunt prae locusta, et nullus eis numerus; pudefacta est filia Aegypti, dabitur in manum populi septentrionis, 
xlvi 20, 22-24; </p>
<p>'Aegyptus' pro ratiocinatione de Divinis ex sensualibus et scientificis; ratiocinia vocantur 'vox serpentis,' et occaecatio inde significatur per 'populum septentrionis:' apud Hiobum, Venenum 
aspidum suget, occidet eum lingua viperae; non videbit rivos, flumina fluviorum mellis et butyri, xx 16, 17; </p>
<p>'fluvii mellis et butyri' sunt spiritualia et caelestia, quae non visuri ratiocinatores; 
ratiocinia vocantur 'venenum aspidum, et lingua viperae.' Plura de serpente videas infra ad vers. 14 @	1 In A.R. 462 this is rendered incantatoris incantationum.    The Hebrew seems to allow 
of both renderings.$ </p>
