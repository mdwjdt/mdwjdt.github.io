<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5772.</strong>创世记44:13-17.他们就撕裂衣服，各人又使驴驮上重载，回城去了。犹大和他弟兄们来到约瑟的屋中，约瑟还在那里，他们就在他面前俯伏于地。约瑟对他们说，你们作的这是什么事呢？你们岂不知像我这样的人必能占卜吗？犹大说，我们对我主说什么呢？我们还有什么可说的呢？我们怎能辩屈呢？神已经查出仆人的罪孽了；看哪，我们是我主的奴仆，我们与那在他手中找着杯的都是。约瑟说，我断不能这样行，在谁的手中找着杯，谁就作我的奴仆；至于你们，可以平平安安地上你们父亲那里去。<br />“他们就撕裂衣服”表哀悼。“各人又使驴驮上重载，回城去了”表真理从感官印象被带回到记忆知识。“犹大和他弟兄们来到”表教会的良善及其真理。“约瑟的屋中”表与内在的交流。“约瑟还在那里”表预见。“他们就在他面前俯伏于地”表谦卑。“约瑟对他们说”表他们此时的觉知。“你们作的这是什么事呢”表声称不是自己的东西属于自己就是大恶。“你们岂不知像我这样的人必能占卜吗”表这恶瞒不住他，因为他能看见将来和隐藏的事。“犹大说”表赋予属世层中教会良善的觉知。“我们对我主说什么呢？我们还有什么可说的呢”表摇摆不定。“我们怎能辩屈呢”表我们有罪。“神已经查出仆人的罪孽了”表忏悔。“看哪，我们是我主的奴仆”表他们将永远被剥夺自己的自由。“我们”表附属者。“与那在他手中找着杯的都是”表和与来自神性属天层的内层真理同在的人。“约瑟说，我断不能这样行”表绝不可做这事。“在谁的手中找着杯”表与从神性所领受的内层真理同在的那个人。“谁就作我的奴仆”表他将永远顺服。“至于你们，可以平平安安地上你们父亲那里去”表附属者，他们中间没有内层真理，故要回到以前的状态。</p>

Verses 13-17. And they rent their garments, and laded everyone his ass, and returned to the city. And Judah and his brethren entered Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him to 
the earth. And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? Knew ye not that such a man as I divining divineth? And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? and how 
shall we be justified? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold we are servants to my lord, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup was found. And he said, Far be it from me to do 
this; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be to me a servant; and ye, go ye up in peace to your father. "And they rent their garments," signifies mourning; "and laded everyone his ass, and 
returned to the city," signifies that truths were brought back from things of sense to memory-knowledges; "and Judah and his brethren entered," signifies the good of the church with its truths; "Joseph's 
house," signifies communication with the internal; "and he was yet there," signifies foresight; "and they fell before him to the earth," signifies humiliation; "and Joseph said unto them," signifies 
their perception then; "What deed is this that ye have done?" signifies that to claim to themselves what is not theirs is an enormous evil; "knew ye not that such a man as I divining divineth?" 
signifies that it cannot be concealed from Him who sees future and hidden things; "and Judah said," signifies perception given to the good of the church in the natural; "What shall we say to my lord? 
what shall we speak?" signifies a wavering; "and how shall we be justified?" signifies that we are guilty; "God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants," signifies confession; "behold we are servants 
to my lord," signifies that they are forever to be deprived of freedom of their own; "both we," signifies the associates; "and he also in whose hand the cup was found," signifies as well as he with 
whom there is interior truth from the Divine celestial; "and he said, Far be it from me to do this," signifies that it should by no means be so; "the man in whose hand the cup was found," signifies 
but that he with whom is interior truth received from the Divine; "he shall be to me a servant," signifies that he will be forever subject; "and ye, go ye up in peace to your father," signifies that the 
associates, with whom there is not that truth, are to return to the former state. </p>

Verses 13-17 And they rent their clothes; and each one loaded his ass, and they returned to the city. And Judah and his brothers entered Joseph's house, and he, he was still there; and they fell before 
him to the earth. And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Did you not know that a man such as I certainly practises divination? And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord, 
what shall we speak? And how shall we be acquitted? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, even ourselves, even he in whose hand the cup was found. And [Joseph] 
said, Far be it from me to do this; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he will be my slave, and you, go up in peace to your father. </p>
<p>'And they rent their clothes' means mourning. 'And each 
one loaded his ass, and they returned to the city' means that truths were brought back up from sensory impressions to known facts. 'And Judah and his brothers entered' means the good of the Church and 
the accompanying truths. 'Joseph's house' means a communication with the internal. 'And he, he was still there' means foresight. 'And they fell before him to the earth' means an expression of humility. 
'And Joseph said to them' means their perception at this point. 'What deed is this that you have done?' means that to lay claim to what is not one's own is a gross evil. 'Did you not know that a man 
such as I certainly practises divination?' means that that evil cannot be hidden from him who sees things that are to come and lie concealed. 'And Judah said' means a perception imparted to the good 
of the Church in the natural. 'What shall we say to my lord, what shall we speak?' means a wavering. 'And how shall we be acquitted?' means that we are guilty. 'God has found out the iniquity of your 
servants' means a confession. 'Behold, we are my lord's slaves' means that they are to be deprived for ever of their own freedom. 'Even ourselves' means both the adjuncts . . . 'Even he in whose hand 
the cup was found' means, and also the one with whom interior truth from the Divine celestial exists. 'And [Joseph] said, Far be it from me to do this' means that this must on no account be done. 'The 
man in whose hand the cup was found' means the one with whom interior truth received from the Divine exists. 'He will be my slave' means that he will be in subjection forever. 'And you, go up in peace 
to your father' means that the adjuncts, among whom that interior truth does not exist, are to return to their previous state. </p>

Vers. 13-17.  Et disruperunt vestes suas, et oneravit quisque super asinum suum, et reversi sunt urbem.  Et intravit Jehudah et fratres ejus domum Josephi, et is adhuc is ibi; et ceciderunt coram illo 
terram.  Et dixit ad illos Joseph, Quod factum hoc quod fecistis? nonne scivistis quod divinando divinet vir qui sicut ego? Et dixit Jehudah, Quid dicemus domino meo, quid loquemur? et quomodo justificabimur? 
Deus invenit iniquitatem servorum tuorum; ecce nos servi domino meo, etiam nos, etiam in cujus inventus scyphus manu.  Et dixit, Absit mihi a faciendo hoc, vir in cujus inventus scyphus manu, 
ille erit mihi servus, et vos ascendite in pace ad patrem vestrum.  `Et disruperunt vestes suas significat luctum: `et oneravit quisque super asinum suum, et reversi sunt urbem' significat quod a 
sensualibus reducerentur vera in scientifica:  `et intravit Jehudah et fratres ejus' significat bonum Ecclesiae cum veris suis:  `domum Josephi' significat communicationem cum interno:  `et is adhuc is 
ibi' significat praevidentiam:  `et ceciderunt coram illo terram' significat humiliationem:  `et dixit ad illos Joseph'  significat perceptionem tunc illorum:  `Quod factum hoc quod fecistis?' significat 
quod vindicare sibi quod suum non est, sit enorme malum:  `nonne scivistis quod divinando divinet vir qui sicut ego?' significat quod abscondi id nequeat ab illo qui futura et latentia videt:  `et 
dixit Jehudah' significat perceptionem datam bono Ecclesiae in naturali:  `Quid dicemus domino meo, quid loquemur?' significat fluctuationem:  `et quomodo justificabimur?' significat quod rei simus: 
 `Deus invenit iniquitatem servorum tuorum' significat confessionem:  `ecce nos servi domino meo' significat quod privandi libero proprio in perpetuum:  `etiam nos' significat tam associati: `etiam 
in cujus inventus scyphus manu' significat {1}quam apud quem verum interius a caelesti Divino:  `et dixit, Absit mihi a faciendo hoc' significat quod nequaquam ita fiet:  `vir in cujus inventus scyphus 
manu' significat sed quod is apud quem verum interius acceptum a Divino:  `ille erit mihi servus' significat quod is in perpetuum subjectus:  `et vos ascendite in pace ad patrem vestrum' significat 
quod associati apud quos non id verum, ad statum priorem redituri. @1 see also 5788$ </p>
