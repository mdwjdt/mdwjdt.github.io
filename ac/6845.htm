<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6845节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6845.</strong>“因为你所站的地方是圣地”表否则，神性无法进入。这从“地方”和“圣地”的含义清楚可知：“地方”（地方）是指状态（<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>节），因此，“你所站的地方”是指他目前所在的状态；“圣地”（holy ground）是指从主发出的神圣。因此，这些话所表示的，是从主的神性人身发出一种状态。它表示，否则，神性无法进入；这层含义从刚才所说的可推知，即：如果人没有移除形成属世层外在层面的感官力量，也就是没有从它们被提升至更内在的层面，那么神性就无法流入。只要人的思维仍停留在感官层面，神性就无法流入；原因在于，来自神性的流注一直延伸至那些在次序上最末后的事物，因而延伸至形成人的属世层外在层面的感官力量。如果这些层面唯独在于肉体和世俗兴趣，所流入的神性事物就会在那里消散，化为乌有，因为它们与那里的东西不相容。因此，当人即将接受神性，也就是信与爱的事物时，他就从感官力量中被提升上来；一旦他从中被提升上来，神性就不再流入那里，即流入感官的外在层面，而是流入此人被提升到的内在层面。我已通过大量经历得以知道事实的确如此。</p>

For the place whereon thou standest a ground of holiness is this. That this signifies that otherwise the Divine cannot enter, is evident from the signification of "place," as being state (n. 2625, 2837, 
3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605), whence "the place whereon thou standest" denotes the state in which he as yet is; and from the signification of "ground of holiness," as being the holy which proceeds 
from the Lord. Thus it is a state of the holy proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human which is meant by these words. That it signifies that otherwise the Divine cannot enter, follows from what goes 
before, namely, that if man were not removed from sensuous things, which are the externals of the natural, that is, if he were not elevated from these to things interior, the Divine could not flow in. 
The reason why the Divine cannot flow in with man so long as he is in these sensuous things, is that the influx from the Divine passes on even to those things which are last in order, thus down to the 
sensuous things which are the externals of the natural with man; and if the things therein be merely bodily and earthly, the Divine things which flow in are there dissipated, because they are not in 
agreement. Therefore when man is about to receive the Divine, that is, the things which are of faith and love, he is elevated from sensuous things; and when he has been elevated from them, the Divine 
no longer flows in thither, namely, into the external sensuous, but into the interior plane into which the man has been elevated. That this is the case it has been given me to know from much experience. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6845</b></p><p><b>6845.</b>
'For the place which you are standing on is holy ground' means that otherwise the Divine cannot come in. This is clear from the meaning of 'place' as a state, dealt with in <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, and therefore 'the place which you are standing on' is the state in which he is up to this point; and from the meaning of 'holy ground' as the holiness which goes forth from the Lord. 
Thus a state of the holy influence from the Lord's Divine Human is what these words are used to mean. This meaning - that otherwise the Divine cannot come in - follows from what is said immediately before, 
namely that if a person were not removed from the powers of the senses, which form the external levels of the natural, that is, if he were not raised from them to more internal levels, the Divine 
could not flow in. The reason why the Divine cannot flow in as long as the person's thought remains on the level of the senses is that influx from the Divine extends right through to things that are 
last in order, thus right through to the powers of the senses which form the external levels of a person's natural. If those levels consist solely of bodily and earthly interests the Divine influences 
coming in are reduced to nothing since they are incompatible with what is there. Consequently when a person is about to receive the Divine, that is, matters of faith and love, he is raised from the 
powers of the senses; and once he has been raised from them, the Divine no longer flows in there, into the external level of the senses, but into the more internal level to which the person has been raised. 
I have been allowed to know from a considerable amount of experience that this is so. </p>

`Quia locus quo tu stas super, humus sanctitatis ille': quod significet quod alioquin Divinum intrare nequeat, constat ex significatione `loci' quod sit status, de qua n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 
4882, (x)5605; inde `locus quo tu stas super' est status in quo adhuc est; et ex significatione `humi sanctitatis' quod sit sanctum quod procedit ex {1}Domino; ita est status sancti procedentis a Divino 
Humano Domini, qui per illa verba intelligitur.  Quod significetur quod alioquin Divinum intrare nequeat, sequitur ex {2} antecedentibus; si nempe {3}homo non removeretur a sensualibus quae sunt 
externa naturalis, hoc est, si non elevaretur ab illis ad interiora, quod Divinum non posset influere; causa quod Divinum non influere possit apud hominem quamdiu ille est in sensualibus illis, est quia 
influxus a Divino pergit usque ad illa quae in ordine ultima sunt, ita usque ad sensualia quae sunt externa naturalis apud hominem, {4} si inibi mere corporea et terrestria sunt, Divina quae influunt, 
ibi dissipantur, nam non concordant; quapropter cum homo recepturus est Divinum, hoc est, illa quae fidei et amoris sunt, elevatur is a sensualibus, et cum elevatus est ab illis, tunc Divinum non 
amplius influit illuc, nempe in sensuale externum {5}, sed in planum interius in quod homo elevatus est.  Quod ita sit, a multa experientia scire datum est. 	@1 Divino$ 	@2 i mox$ 	@3 After removeretur$ 	@4
