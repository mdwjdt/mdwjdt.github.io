<p><strong>[NCE]460.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_460/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_1-32" target=_top>Genesis 5</a><br />1. This is the book of the births of the human, on the day on which God created the human; in God's likeness he made the human.<br />2. Male and female he created them. And he blessed them. And he called their name Human Being on the day on which they were created.<br />3. And the human lived one hundred thirty years. And he fathered [a child] in his likeness, after his image. And he called his name Seth.<br />4. And after the human fathered Seth, his days were eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />5. And all the days that the human lived were nine hundred thirty years. And he died.<br />6. And Seth lived one hundred five years and fathered Enosh.<br />7. And after Seth fathered Enosh he lived eight hundred seven years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />8. And all Seth's days were nine hundred twelve years. And he died.<br />9. And Enosh lived ninety years and fathered Kenan.<br />10. And after Enosh fathered Kenan he lived eight hundred fifteen years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />11. And all Enosh's days were nine hundred five years. And he died.<br />12. And Kenan lived seventy years and fathered Mahalalel.<br />13. And after Kenan fathered Mahalalel he lived eight hundred forty years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />14. And all Kenan's days were nine hundred ten years. And he died.<br />15. And Mahalalel lived sixty-five years and fathered Jared.<br />16. And after Mahalalel fathered Jared he lived eight hundred thirty years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />17. And all Mahalalel's days were eight hundred ninety-five years. And he died.<br />18. And Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years and fathered Enoch.<br />19. And after Jared fathered Enoch he lived eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />20. And all Jared's days were nine hundred sixty-two years. And he died.<br />21. And Enoch lived sixty-five years and fathered Methuselah.<br />22. And after Enoch fathered Methuselah he walked with God three hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />23. And all Enoch's days were three hundred sixty-five years.<br />24. And Enoch walked with God and was no more, because God took him.<br />25. And Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years and fathered Lamech.<br />26. And after Methuselah fathered Lamech he lived seven hundred eighty-two years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />27. And all Methuselah's days were nine hundred sixty-nine years. And he died.<br />28. And Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years. And he fathered a son.<br />29. And he called his name Noah, saying, "He will console us{*1} for our work and for the distress of our hands from the ground, which Jehovah cursed."<br />30. And after Lamech fathered Noah he lived five hundred ninety-five years. And he fathered sons and daughters.<br />31. And all Lamech's days were seven hundred seventy-seven years. And he died.<br />32. And Noah was a son of five hundred years.{*2} And Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.<br />460. Summary<br />THIS chapter deals specifically with the propagation of the earliest church in later generations, almost up to the time of the Flood.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_460/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_29" target=_top>Genesis 5:29</a>). The Hebrew is drawing a connection between the name Noah and a verb for "console," נִחַם (niḥḥam). The original root has to do with "rest," a meaning elucidated below at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_460/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851" target=_top>851</a>. [LHC, RS]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_460/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_32" target=_top>Genesis 5:32</a>). Based on the notion of one's having "become a child" (been born) at a certain point in the past, "a son of (so many) years" is a Hebraism meaning simply "(so many) years old" and is often translated in that way.
