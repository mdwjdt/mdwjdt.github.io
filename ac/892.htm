<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>892.</strong>一旦人得以重生，那么他会首次进入自由状态。之前他一直处于奴役状态。恶欲与虚假居于主导地位就是奴役，对善与真的情感居于主导地位就是自由。只要处在奴役的状态，人永远觉察不到自己的处境。只有当他进入自由状态时，他才开始有所察觉。当他处在奴役状态，即当恶欲与虚假居于主导地位时，这个人就会受制于自己的想象，以为自己处在自由的状态。殊不知，那纯粹是虚假，因为此时他正陶醉在恶欲及其欢娱的快乐中，即陶醉在自己的爱之快乐中。由于他正陶醉在这种快乐中，所以他看似是一个自由人。当人被某种爱所牵引，并且这爱到哪，他跟随到哪时，他以为自己是自由的。然而，与他相伴、可以说折磨他的，正是恶魔般的精灵，他们正在抬走他。而此人却以为这是绝对的自由。事实上，他走得太远，以至于他以为若丧失这种状态，必会陷入极其悲惨的境地，甚至根本没有生命可言。他之所以这样认为，不仅因为他没有意识另一种生活的存在，还因为他原以为人若不遭受艰难、贫穷、丧失乐趣，就无法进入天堂。然而，这是错误的，我通过大量经历得知这一点。蒙主慈悲，这些经历将在后面予以描述。<br />没人能进入自由状态，除非他已重生，正被主藉着对善与真的爱所引领。当进入这种状态时，他就能第一次知道并发觉何为真自由，因为这时他能知道并发觉何为生命，何为生活的真快乐，以及何为幸福。在此之前，他甚至不知道何为良善，有时会视大善为大恶。当那些通过主处于自由状态中的人看清恶欲与虚假的生活，特别是经历到它时，他们会被它吓得魂飞魄散，就象看到眼前敞开的地狱之人那样。不过，鉴于绝大多数人对何为自由的生活一无所知，在此作以简短介绍：自由的生活，或自由本身就是单单被主引领。有相当多的障碍使人难以相信这种生活才是自由的生活。其中一个障碍是，人们会经历试探，以便他能摆脱恶魔般的精灵辖制。另一个是，他们只知道欲望的快乐，而欲望来自我欲和物欲。再一个是，他们对属天堂生活的所有事物已形成谬念。所以，他们无法象通过活生生的经历那样通过描述接受更好地指教。蒙主慈悲，我们会在后面介绍这些经历。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]892.</strong> We first come into a state of freedom after we have regenerated; until then, we are in a state of slavery. Enslavement occurs when cravings and falsity rule over us; freedom results when a fondness for what is good and true takes charge. As long as we are enslaved, we have no perception of the actual state of affairs. The first perception dawns when we come into freedom.<br />In a state of slavery, when cravings and falsity take control, those of us under their yoke think we are enjoying freedom; but this is grossly untrue. At such a time, we are carried away by the pleasure that our vices and the indulgence of them brings us, or in other words, by the pleasure that selfish kinds of love bring us. Since it is pleasure that engrosses us, we see it as freedom.<br />Whenever some specific passion leads us, no matter what direction it goes, if we follow it, we consider it a liberating thing. But it is devilish spirits — whose company we keep and whose stampede we join — that sweep us along. This we consider the epitome of freedom. In fact we believe life would become positively miserable and even end if we were deprived of such a condition. It is not merely that we know of no other kind of life; we also receive the impression that no one can make it into heaven except through misfortune, poverty, and renunciation of pleasure. But this is untrue, as I have learned from much experience, which I will describe later, the Lord in his divine mercy willing.{*1} [2] We never come into a free condition until we have regenerated and until the Lord leads us by means of a love for what is good and true. Once we arrive there, we are able to see and perceive for the first time what liberty is, because we then realize what life is and what true pleasure in life and happiness are. Up to that time, we do not even know what goodness is, and occasionally we refer to the height of evil as the greatest good. When people who enjoy a state of freedom given by the Lord observe a life of perverted desire and false thinking, and particularly when they sense it, they are as horrified as if they saw hell gaping open before their very eyes.<br />As most people today have absolutely no idea what a life of freedom is, let me offer this brief definition: freedom, or a life of freedom, is solely and simply being led by the Lord.<br />Many things come up, however, that make it impossible for people to believe that this kind of life is a free one. For one thing, we suffer times of trial (whose whole purpose is to deliver us from the tyranny of diabolical spirits). For another, we recognize nothing as pleasing and good but the attainment of our selfish and worldly desires. In addition, we form false opinions about all facets of heavenly life. For these reasons, explanations are less effective as educational tools than reports of actual experience are. Let me relate such experiences at a future point, then, by the Lord's divine mercy [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_892/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2870" target=_top>2870-2893</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For later passages in which Swedenborg speaks against religious practices of self-punishment and renunciation of wealth and pleasure, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_892/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_945" target=_top>945</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_892/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3951#subsection-2-2" target=_top>3951:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_892/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5573#subsection-2-2" target=_top>5573:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_892/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_528" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 528</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_892/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_535" target=_top>535</a>.

When man has been regenerated, he then for the first time comes into a state of freedom, having before been in a state of slavery. It is slavery when cupidities and falsities rule, and freedom when the 
affections of good and truth do so. How this is, no man ever perceives so long as he is in a state of slavery, but only when he comes into a state of freedom. When he is in a state of slavery, that 
is, when cupidities and falsities rule, the man who is under subjection to them supposes that he is in a state of freedom; but this is a gross falsity, for he is then carried away by the delight of the 
cupidities and their pleasures, that is, by the delight of his loves; and because this is done by delight, it appears to him to be freedom. Every man, while he is led by any love, and while following 
whithersoever it carries him, supposes himself to be free, whereas it is the diabolical spirits in whose company, and so to speak torrent, he is, that are carrying him away. This the man supposes to 
be the greatest freedom, so much so that he believes that the loss of this state would bring him into a life most wretched, indeed into no life at all; and he believes this not merely because he is 
unaware of the existence of any other life, but also because he is under the impression that no one can come into heaven except through miseries, poverty, and the loss of pleasures. But that this impression 
is false has been given me to know by much experience, of which by the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. Man never comes into a state of freedom until he has been regenerated, and is led by the Lord 
through love for what is good and true. When he is in this state, then for the first time can he know and perceive what freedom is, because he then knows what life is, and what the true delight of 
life is, and what happiness is. Before this he does not even know what good is, sometimes calling that the greatest good which is the greatest evil. When those who are in a state of freedom from the Lord 
see, and still more when they feel, a life of cupidities and falsities, they abhor it as do those who see hell open before their eyes. But as it is quite unknown to very many what a life of freedom 
is, it may be here briefly defined. A life of freedom, or freedom, is simply and solely being led by the Lord. But as there are many things which hinder man from being able to believe that this is a 
life of freedom, both because men undergo temptations, which take place in order that they may be set free from the dominion of diabolical spirits; and because they know of no other delight than that 
of cupidities from the love of self and of the world, as well as from their having conceived a false opinion in regard to all things of the heavenly life, so that they cannot be taught by description 
so well as by living experiences, therefore, of the Lord's Divine mercy, we may adduce such experiences hereafter. </p>

Once someone has been regenerated he enters for the first time into a state of freedom. Previously he has been in a state of slavery. It is slavery when evil desires and falsities predominate, freedom 
when affections for good and truth do so. As long as he is in a state of slavery, a person never perceives what his situation is. Only when he enters a state of freedom does he start to do so. When 
he is in a state of slavery, that is, when evil desires and falsities predominate, the person who has become subject to them imagines that he is in a state of freedom. That however is sheer falsity, for 
he is at that time being carried away by the delight that accompanies desires and resulting pleasures, that is, by the delight accompanying the loves that are his own. And because he is being carried 
away by such delight it seems to him as though he were a free man. While anyone is being led on by any kind of love, and following wherever it leads, he imagines that he is free. It is however the 
devilish spirits, in whose company and so to speak fast moving stream he is caught, who carry him away. This person imagines that this is absolute freedom, indeed he goes so far as to believe that if 
he were robbed of this state he would be entering upon a very miserable existence, in fact into no existence at all. This he believes not only because he is unaware of the existence of any other kind 
of life but also because he has gained the impression that nobody can enter heaven without suffering hardships, poverty, and deprivation of pleasures. That this is false however I have been given to know 
from considerable experience That experience will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 No one ever enters into a state of freedom until he has been regenerated and is being led 
by the Lord by means of the love of good and truth. When he has entered that state he is enabled to know and perceive for the first time what freedom really is, because he can at that point know and 
perceive what life is, what the true delight in life is, and what happiness is. Prior to this he does not even know what good is, and sometimes that which is supremely good he calls supremely evil. When 
persons who are in a state of freedom from the Lord see the life that goes with evil desires and falsities, and even more when they experience it, they are as appalled by it as people who see hell 
opened before their eyes. But because the majority of people have no knowledge at all of what a life of freedom is, let a brief mention of it be made here: A life of freedom, or freedom itself, means 
being led exclusively by the Lord. Quite a number of obstacles stand in the way of a person's being able to believe that that kind of life is a life of freedom. One obstacle is that people undergo temptations, 
which take place for the purpose of freeing them from the dominion of devilish spirits. Another is that they know of no other delight and good apart from those belonging to the desires that 
result from self-love and love of the world. A further obstacle is that they have formed a false impression of all the things that belong to heavenly life. Consequently they are less able to learn from 
descriptions than from actual experiences, which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be introduced later on. </p>

Quando homo regeneratus est, tunc primum in statum libertatis venit; antea in statu servitutis fuit; servitus est cum imperant cupiditates et falsitates, libertas cum affectiones boni et veri; quod 
quomodo se habet, nusquam homo percipit quamdiu in statu servitutis est, sed tunc primum quando in statum libertatis venit: cum in statu servitutis est, hoc est, cum cupiditates et falsitates imperant, 
putat homo qui ab illis subjugatus est, quod in statu libertatis sit; sed crassa est falsitas, aufertur enim tunc a jucundo cupiditatum et voluptatum inde, seu a jucundo amorum suorum, et quia a jucundo, 
apparet ei sicut liberum; quisque dum a quodam amore ducitur, quocumque aufertur, dum sequitur, liberum putat; sed sunt diabolici spiritus, in quorum consortio et quasi torrente est, qui auferant 
eum; hoc putat homo liberrimum esse, et quidem in tantum ut credat, si privaretur hoc statu, quod in vitam miserrimam veniret, immo quod non in aliquam; et hoc non solum ex eo quod nesciat dari aliam 
vitam, sed etiam ex eo quod impressiones captaverit quod nemo in caelum venire possit nisi per miserias, paupertatem, et voluptatum privationes; sed quod hoc falsum sit, a plure experientia mihi scire 
datum est; de qua experientia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus.  [2] Homo nusquam in statum libertatis venit antequam regeneratus est et per amorem boni et veri ducitur a Domino; in quo 
statu cum est, tunc primum scire et percipere potest quid liberum, quia tunc quid vita, et quid vera vitae jucunditas, et quid felicitas; prius ne quidem scit quid bonum; id quandoque summum bonum 
vocat quod summum malum: qui in statu libertatis a Domino sunt, cum vident, magis cum sentiunt vitam cupiditatum et falsitatum, ita eam abhorrent sicut qui infernum ante oculos apertum vident: sed quia 
ignotissimum plerisque est quid vita libertatis, licet his paucis dicere quid sit, nempe quod vita libertatis, seu libertas, solummodo sit duci a Domino.  Sed quia plura sunt quae obveniunt quin homo 
credere possit quod illa vita sit vita libertatis, tam quia tentationes subeunt, quae fiunt 'ob causam ut liberentur a dominio spirituum diabolicorum, quam quia non aliud jucundum et bonum norunt quam 
cupiditatum ex amore sui et mundi; tum etiam quia falsam opinionem conceperunt de omnibus quae sunt vitae caelestis, quare non possunt per descriptiones ita erudiri quam per vivas experientias, ideo, 
ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus {1} illas licet adducere. 	@1 For full explanation de libero hominis see n. 2870-2893.$ </p>
