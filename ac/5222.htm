<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5222.</strong>“法老的灵烦乱”表混乱。这从“灵烦乱”的含义清楚可知，“灵烦乱”是指被置于混乱中。此处的“灵”，如在别处圣言几次所提到的那样，表示人的内层情感和思维，它们也构成他的灵。古人称这些东西为灵；但他们所说的灵特指肉身死后还会活着的内层人；而如今在这层意义所说的“灵”是指纯粹的思维，这种思维除了它所在的肉身外，没有任何主体。<br />这种不同理解的原因在于，人们不再相信内层人才是一个人的真正自我，或说这个人自己。确切地说，他们以为一般人称之为灵魂或灵的内层人是纯粹的思维，这思维没有适合它的一个主体。因此，他们以为，它既是没有一个主体的思维，那么在肉身死后，就会像某种空气或火焰般的东西那样消散。这就是如今人们对“灵”的理解，如当经上说“灵里烦乱”、“灵里悲伤”、“灵里欢喜”、“灵里快乐”时的情形。而事实上，正是内层人本身被称为灵，并且烦乱、悲伤、欢喜、快乐。这内层人尽管不为肉眼所见，却存在于一个完整的人形里面，就在思维所居之处。</p>

His spirit was troubled. That this signifies disturbance, is evident from the signification of "being troubled in spirit," as being to be disturbed. By "spirit" here, as occasionally elsewhere in the 
Word, is meant interior affection and thought, which also are the spirit of man. The ancients called these the spirit; but by the spirit they meant specifically the interior man that would live after 
the death of the body; while at this day "the spirit," used in this sense, means mere thought, and this without any subject other than the body in which it may be. This is because it is no longer believed 
that the interior man is the man himself, but that the interior man who is commonly called the soul or spirit is mere thought without a subject adapted thereto; and that consequently, being thought 
without a subject, it will be dissipated after the death of the body like something ethereal or flamy. This is what at the present day is understood by spirit," as when it is said "troubled in spirit," 
"sad in spirit," "glad in spirit," or "rejoice in spirit;" when yet it is the interior man himself that is called the spirit, and that is troubled, is sad, is glad, and rejoices, and that is a man 
in a form wholly human (though invisible to bodily sight) in which thought resides. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5222</b></p><p><b>5222.</b>
That his spirit was troubled' means a turmoil. This is clear from the meaning of 'being troubled in spirit' as being placed in a turmoil. 'Spirit' is used here, as it is several times elsewhere in the 
Word, to mean a person's interior affection and thought, which also constitute his spirit. The ancients called these his spirit, but specifically they used spirit to mean the interior man who would 
go on living after the body died. At the present day however, when people read about the spirit where it has that meaning, they understand by it solely the faculty of thought, without anything else subject 
to it apart from the body in which it resides. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason for this different understanding is that people no longer believe that the interior man is a person's true self. Rather, they believe 
that the interior man, which ordinary people call the soul or spirit, is merely the faculty of thought without anything else compatible with and subject to it. Consequently they believe that because 
that faculty has nothing subject to it in which to reside, it will be dissipated after death in the way something air-like or flame-like is dissipated. This is the kind of meaning spirit possesses 
at the present day, as when the expression 'troubled in spirit', 'saddened in spirit', 'joyful in spirit', or 'exultant in spirit' is used. But in reality it is the actual interior man that is called 
the spirit and that is troubled, saddened, joyful, or exultant. And this interior man existing within an entirely human form, though this is unseen by the eyes of the body - is where the faculty of thought resides. </p>

`Agitatus spiritus illius': quod significet turbam, constat ex significatione `agitari spiritu' quod sit turbari: per `spiritum' hic, ut quoque aliquoties alibi in Verbo, intelligitur interior affectio 
et cogitatio quae quoque sunt spiritus hominis; antiqui vocarunt illa spiritum, {1}sed per spiritum in specie intellexerunt interiorem hominem qui victurus post mortem corporis; at hodie per spiritum 
ubi in tali sensu legitur, solum intelligitur cogitativum, et hoc absque {2}alio subjecto quam corpore in quo sit; [2] ex causa quia non amplius creditur quod interior homo sit ipse homo, sed quod 
interior homo, qui vulgo anima aut spiritus vocatur, sit modo cogitatio absque subjecto adaequato; consequenter quia cogitatio absque subjecto in quo, quod post mortem corporis sicut aethereum aut flammeum 
quid dissipabitur; tale intelligitur hodie per spiritum, ut cum dicitur agitari spiritu, contristari spiritu, laetari spiritu, ovare spiritu, cum tamen est ipse interior homo qui spiritus vocatur, 
qui agitatur, contristatur, laetatur, ovat, qui {3} est homo in forma prorsus humana, sed invisibili oculis corporis, apud quem cogitatio. @1 at$ @2 aliquo$ @3 i homo$ </p>
