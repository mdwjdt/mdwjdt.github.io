<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5345节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5345.</strong>“约瑟积蓄五谷甚多，如同海边的沙”表源于良善的真理的增多。这从“积蓄”和“谷”的含义清楚可知：“积蓄”在此是指增多；“谷”是指意愿和行为中的真理（<a href="5295.htm">5295</a>节），当被比作“海边的沙”时，其增多表示它源于良善，在此通过流注源于属灵层的属天层的良善。因为除了良善外，内层中真理的增多从不来自任何其它源头。真理若不是源于良善，其增多就不是真理的增多，因为它不是真理，无论它外表看上去多么像真理。它就像一座无生命的雕像；这种真理是死的，故离成为真理差得还很远。因为人的真理若要成为真理，就必须从良善，也就是通过来自主的良善接受生命；当真理以这种方式接受生命时，属灵意义上的增多就可以论及它了。真理的增多唯独源于良善，或说，良善就是使真理增多的唯一源头；这一点从以下事实可以看出来：若非因某种像婚姻那样的事物，没有一样东西能增多。除了良善外，真理无法进入与任何事物的婚姻；如果它进入与其它任何事物的婚姻，这婚姻就不是婚姻，而是奸淫。因此，因婚姻增多之物是合法的，因而是真理；但因奸淫增多之物是不合法的，是虚假，因而不是真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5345</b></p><p><b>5345.</b>
And Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, exceeding much. That this signifies the multiplying of truth from good, is evident from the signification of "heaping up," as here being to multiply; 
and from the signification of "corn," as being truth in the will and in act (n. 5295), the multiplying of which, when compared to the sand of the sea, signifies that it is from good, and here from the 
good of the celestial of the spiritual by influx; for truth in the interiors is never multiplied from any other source than good. The multiplying of the truth which is not from good is not the multiplying 
of truth, because it is not truth, however much in the outward form it may appear to be truth. It is a sort of image with no life in it, and being dead, does not approach truth; for truth to be 
truth in man, must live from good, that is, through good from the Lord; and when it so lives, multiplying may be predicated of it in the spiritual sense. That the multiplying of truth is solely from 
good, may be seen from the fact that nothing can be multiplied except from something like a marriage, and truth cannot enter into marriage with anything but good; if with anything else, it is not marriage, 
but adultery. What therefore is multiplied from marriage is legitimate, thus is truth; but what is multiplied from adultery is not legitimate, but spurious, thus is not truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5345</b></p><p><b>5345.</b>
'And Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, very much' means a multiplication of truth derived from good. This is clear from the meaning here of 'storing up' as multiplying; from the meaning 
of 'grain' as truth present in will and action, dealt with in <a href="5295.htm">5295</a>, the multiplication of which, when likened to 'the sand of the sea', means that it is derived from good, in this case from the good 
of the celestial of the spiritual through the influx of this. For truth in the interior parts is multiplied from no other source than good. A multiplication of truth that does not spring from good is 
not a multiplication of truth, because it is not truth, no matter how much it looks in outward appearance like truth. It is like a lifeless statue; and because such truth is dead it comes nowhere near 
being truth. For if a person's truth is to be truth it must receive life from good, that is, through good from the Lord; and when it does receive life in that manner, that truth can be said in a spiritual 
sense to be multiplied. The fact that good is the only source which enables truth to be multiplied may be seen from the consideration that nothing can be multiplied except from something marriage-like. 
Truth cannot enter into marriage with anything else than good. If it does do so with anything else, that is not marriage but adultery. That which is a multiplication resulting from marriage is 
legitimate, and thus is truth; but that which is the result of adultery is not legitimate. It is spurious and thus is not truth. </p>

</p><b>5345.</b>
`Et congessit Joseph frumentum sicut arenam maris multum valde': quod significet multiplicationem veri a bono, constat ex significatione `congerere' quod hic sit multiplicare; ex significatione `frumenti' 
quod sit verum voluntate et actu, de qua n. 5295, cujus multiplicatio cum comparatur `arenae maris', significat quod sit ex bono, hic (c)ex bono caelestis spiritualis per influxum, verum enim in 
interioribus nusquam aliunde quam ex bono multiplicatur; multiplicatio veri quod non ex bono, non est multiplicatio veri, quia non est verum, {1}utcumque in externa forma apparet ut verum; est quoddam 
simulacrum in quo non vita; hoc quia mortuum, ad verum non accedit, nam verum ut verum sit apud hominem, vivet a bono, hoc est, per bonum a Domino, et cum ita vivit, tunc de illo praedicari potest 
multiplicatio in sensu spirituali. Quod multiplicatio veri sit solum ex bono, constare potest ex eo quod nihil multiplicari possit nisi ex quodam simili conjugii; verum cum alio quam cum bono conjugium 
inire non potest; si cum alio, non est conjugium sed est adulterium; quod itaque multiplicatur ex conjugio, hoc est legitimum, ita verum, quod autem ex adulterio, non est legitimum sed spurium, ita 
non verum{2}. @1 utrumque I$ @2 i de quo praedicari potest multiplicatio$ </p>
