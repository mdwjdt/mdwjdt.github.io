<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第52节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>52.</strong>当人尚是属灵者，他的“管理”是从外在到内在，如本节经文说：“使他们管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟、地上的牲畜，和全地，并地上所爬的一切昆虫。”<br />当他成为属天者，本乎爱而行善，他的“管理”就是从内在到外在，正如主描述自己（故也是描述属天之人，因为他是神的样式）说：“你派他管理你手所造的，使万物，就是一切的羊牛、田间的兽、空中的鸟、海里的鱼，凡经行海道的，都服在他的脚下。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.6.htm">8:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.8.htm">8</a>）此处先提及兽，再提及鸟，再提及海里的鱼，因为属天之人以爱为出发点，爱关乎意志。论到属灵之人，则是先提及鱼和鸟，再提及兽。鱼和鸟关乎觉性，觉性关乎信。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]52.</strong> As long as we are spiritual, we rule the outer self first and from this the inner, as illustrated here in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_52/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_26" target=_top>Genesis 1:26</a>: and they will rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird in the heavens, and over the beast, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creeps on the earth. When we become heavenly, though, and do good because we love to, we rule the inner self first and from it the outer. The Lord describes this as being true of himself; and as it is true of him, it is also true of the heavenly type of person, who is a likeness of him. The words appear in David:<br />You have made him rule over the works of your hands; all things you have put under his feet: the flock and all the herds, and also the animals of the fields, the bird in the heavens, and the fish of the sea — that which travels the paths of the seas. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_52/bible_king-james-version_psalms_8_6-8" target=_top>Psalms 8:6-8</a>)<br />In this passage, animals receive the first mention, next the bird, then the fish of the sea, because the heavenly person proceeds from love, which belongs to the will. Things are different with the spiritual person, for whom the fish and birds come first and the animals follow; fish and birds are associated with the intellect, which concerns itself with faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 52</b></p><p><b>52.</b>
So long as man is spiritual, his dominion proceeds from the external man to the internal, as is here said: "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over 
the beast, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." But when he becomes celestial, and does good from love, then his dominion proceeds from the internal man 
to the external, as the Lord, in David, describes Himself, and thereby also the celestial man, who is His likeness: </p>
<p>     Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put 
all things under his feet, the flock and all cattle, and also the beasts of the fields, the fowl of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas (Ps. 8:6-8). Here 
therefore "beasts" are first mentioned, and then "fowl" and afterwards the "fish of the sea" because the celestial man proceeds from love, which belongs to the will, differing herein from the 
spiritual man, in describing whom "fishes" and "fowl" are first named, which belong to the understanding, and this to faith; and afterwards mention is made of "beasts." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 52</b></p><p><b>52.</b>
As long as someone is a spiritual man, the dominion over him runs from external man to internal man, as is said here, 'They will have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air', and 
over the beasts, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth'. When however he becomes celestial and does what is good out of love, then the dominion over him runs 
from internal man to external man. This is how the Lord describes Himself, and so simultaneously the celestial man, who is a likeness of Him, in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
You have given him dominion over the works 
of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, flocks and all cattle, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the fish of the sea, and that crossing the paths of the seas. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%208:6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 8:6-8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here therefore the beasts are mentioned first, the birds next, and the fish of the sea after that, for the reason that the celestial man starts with love which resides in the will. With 
the spiritual man it is different. With him fish and birds, which have to do with the understanding, the domain of faith, come first, while beasts come afterwards.

</p><b>52.</b>
Quamdiu homo spiritualis est, procedit dominium ejus ab externo homine ad internum, sicut hic dicitur 'dominabuntur in pisces maris, et in avem caelorum, et in bestiam, et in omnem terram, et in omne 
reptans quod reptat super terra'; cum autem fit caelestis et ex amore bonum agit, tunc dominium procedit ab interno homine ad externum, sicut Dominus describit Se Ipsum, et sic simul hominem caelestem 
qui similitudo Ipsius, apud Davidem, Dominari fecisti Illum in opera manuum Tuarum, omnia posuisti sub pedes Illius, gregem et armenta omnia, et quoque bestias agrorum, avem caelorum, et pisces maris, 
transeuntem semitas marium [Ps. viii 7,8,9; A.V. 6,7,8]; </p>
<p>hic ideo primum dicuntur bestiae, dein avis, tum pisces maris, quia homo caelestis ab amore qui est voluntatis procedit, aliter ac apud spiritualem 
hominem, apud quem praecedunt pisces et aves, quae sunt intellectus qui est fidei, et sequuntur bestiae. </p>
