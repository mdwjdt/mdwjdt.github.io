<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第906节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>906.</strong>“你和你的妻子”表教会。这一点同样从语境的连贯性清楚可知，和“你的儿子和儿媳”表他里面的真理和结合于真理的良善一样。显然，“你”表教会成员；“妻子”表教会，“儿子”表真理，“儿媳”表结合于真理的良善，这一点早已数次予以说明，故在此无需赘述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]906.</strong> The symbolism of you and your wife as the church can again be seen from the series of ideas, as can the symbolism of your sons and sons' wives with you as truth, and a goodness bound up with truth, in those people. The symbolism of you as people in the church is obvious, and the symbolism of a wife as the church, of sons as truth, and of sons' wives as the goodness bound up with truth has been shown many times before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_906/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_668" target=_top>668</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_906/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_742" target=_top>742</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_906/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_769" target=_top>769-770</a>]. So there is no need to tarry over it here. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 906</b></p><p><b>906.</b>
That "thou and thy wife" signifies the church, is in like manner evident from the connection, as also that "thy sons and thy sons' wives with thee" signifies the truths, and the goods conjoined with 
truths, that were in him. That "thou" signifies the man of the church, is evident, and that his "wife" signifies the church, and his "sons" truths, and his "sons' wives" goods conjoined with the truths, 
has been shown repeatedly before and need not be dwelt on here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 906</b></p><p><b>906.</b>
'You and your wife' means the Church. This similarly becomes clear from the train of thought, as does 'your sons and your sons with you', which means truths, and goods joined to truths, residing with 
him. 'You', it is evident, means the member of the Church; and the fact that 'wife' means the Church, 'sons' truths, and 'sons' wives' goods joined to truths has been shown in several places already, 
and so there is no need to pause over them here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 906</b>
</p><b>906.</b>
Quod 'tu et uxor tua' significet Ecclesiam, similiter a serie rerum constare potest; tum quod 'filii et uxores filiorum tecum' significent vera et bona conjuncta veris apud illum: quod 'tu' significet 
hominem Ecclesiae, patet; et quod 'uxor' significet Ecclesiam, et quod 'filii' vera, et 'uxores filiorum' bona conjuncta veris, prius passim ostensum est, quare non illis immorandum. </p>
