<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1988节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1988.</strong>“亚伯兰年九十九岁的时候”表主将内在人与理性人充分融合之前的时间。这从“九”或“九十九”的含义清楚可知，只需想想九比十少一，或九十九比一百少一。因为当撒莱为亚伯兰生以撒时，亚伯兰整一百岁。圣言内义的性质通过所用的数字，如通过名字那样尤其变得明显。在圣言中，无论提及什么样的数字，以及什么样的名字，它们均表示真实事物，因为圣言中绝不存在其中没有神性之物，或没有某种内义之物。至于内义距离字义何等遥远，这尤其从数字和名字明显看出来。因为在天堂，他们并不关注任何名字和数字，只关注它们所表示的事物。例如，每当数字“七”出现时，天使立刻想到神圣之物，而非数字七。因为“七”由于以下事实而表神圣之物，即属天之人是“第七日”或“安息日”，因而是主的“安歇”（<a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a>，<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）。这同样适用于其它数字，如数字十二。每当“十二”出现时，属信的一切事物的观念就会提示给天使，因为以色列的“十二支派”就表示属信的一切事物（<a href="577.htm">577</a>节）。在圣言中，数字表示真实事物，这在第一卷已予以说明（<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）。<br />数字“九十九”也一样。该数字表示主将内在人与理性人充分融合之前的时间，这从“一百岁”的含义清楚可知，“一百岁”是撒莱为亚伯兰生以撒时，亚伯兰的年纪。因为以撒代表和表示与其内在，即神性联结的主的理性人。在圣言中，“一百”和“十”意思一样。因为一百就是十乘十，而“十”表余留，如第一卷所示（<a href="576.htm">576</a>节）。至于何为人里面的余留，可参看468，530，561，660，1050节；至于何为主里面的余留，可参看1906节。这些奥秘无法进一步予以解释，不过，一旦获知何为余留（因为如今人们不知道何为余留），谁都能清楚明白这个问题。只是要知道，对主而言，余留表示祂凭自己的能力为自己获取的神性良善，祂凭借这神性良善将人性本质与神性本质融合。<br />由此可见“九十九”表示什么，因为这个数字比一百少一，故表示主将内在人与理性人充分融合之前的时间。对主而言，第一理性由以实玛利来代表；该理性的性质在前面已充分说明（16章）。但以撒代表主的神圣理性，这从下文明显可知。谁都看出以下事实包含一个奥秘：亚伯兰在迦南地呆了那么长时间（到现在是二十四年，也就是说，以实玛利出生前有十年，出生后是十三年），而他的妻子撒莱依然没有给他生一个儿子；于是，他首先得到一个儿子的应许，这时，他已年满九十九岁，等到这个儿子出生，他就整一百岁了。这个奥秘就是，通过这些经历，他能代表主神性本质与其人性本质的融合，事实上，代表祂的内在人，就是耶和华，与其理性人的融合。</p>

Abram was a son of ninety years and nine years. That this signifies the time before the Lord had fully conjoined the internal man with the rational, is evident from the signification of "nine" when regarded 
as coming before ten; or what is the same, of "ninety-nine" before a hundred, for Abram was a hundred years old when Isaac was born to him. The nature of the internal sense of the Word may be 
seen in an especial manner from the numbers, as well as from the names, that occur in the Word; for the numbers therein, whatever they may be, signify actual things, as do the names also; for there is 
absolutely nothing in the Word that has not what is Divine within it, or that does not possess an internal sense; and how remote this is from the sense of the letter is especially manifest from the numbers 
and the names; for in heaven no attention is given to these, but to the things that are signified by them. For example, whenever the number "seven" occurs, instead of seven there at once comes 
to the angels what is holy, for "seven" signifies what is holy, and this from the fact that the celestial man is the "seventh day," or "Sabbath," and thus the Lord's "rest" (n. 84-87, 395, 433, 716, 881). 
The case is similar with the other numbers, as for example with twelve. Whenever "twelve" occurs, there comes to the angels the idea of all things that belong to faith, for the reason that these 
were signified by the "twelve tribes" (n. 577). That in the Word numbers signify actual things, may be seen demonstrated in Part First (n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 893).  [2] The 
case is the same with the number "ninety-nine;" and that this number signifies the time before the Lord had fully conjoined the internal man with the rational, is evident from the signification of a "hundred 
years," which was Abram's age when Isaac was born to him; for by Isaac is represented and signified the Lord's rational man that is conjoined with His internal man, that is, with the Divine. In 
the Word, a "hundred" signifies the same as "ten," for it is formed by the multiplication of ten into ten and "ten" signifies remains (as shown in Part First, n. 576). What the remains in man are, may 
be seen above (n. 468, 530, 561, 660, 1050), also what the remains in the Lord were (n. 1906). These arcana cannot be set forth further, but everyone may form a conclusion on the subject after he has 
first made himself acquainted with what remains are (for what they are is at this day unknown), provided it be known that in the Lord's case remains mean the Divine goods that He procured for Himself 
by His own power, and by means of which He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence.  [3] From all this we may see what is signified by "ninety-nine," for this number, because it precedes a 
hundred, signifies the time before the Lord had fully conjoined the internal man with the rational. In the Lord's case, the first rational was represented by Ishmael; and the nature of this rational has 
been sufficiently shown above (in the preceding chapter 16). But by Isaac is represented the Lord's Divine rational, as will appear in what follows. From Abram's staying so long in the land of Canaan 
(now twenty-four years, that is, ten years before Ishmael was born, and thirteen years after that) without his as yet having a son by his wife Sarai, and from the promise of a son being first given 
when he was ninety-nine years old, everyone can see that some arcanum is involved. The arcanum was, that he might thereby represent the union of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence; and 
in fact the union of His internal man, which is Jehovah, with His rational. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1988</b></p><p><b>1988.</b>
'Abram was a son of ninety-nine years' means the period of time before the Lord fully joined the Internal Man to the Rational Man. This is clear from the meaning of 'nine' when thought of as one less 
than ten, or what amounts to the same, of 'ninety-nine' when thought of as one less than a hundred; for when Isaac was born to him Abram was a hundred years old. The nature of the internal sense of the 
Word is made especially clear by the numbers that are used, as it is by the names. Any numbers whatever, as also any names, that are mentioned in the Word mean real things; for nothing ever exists 
in the Word that does not have that which is Divine within it, that is, which does not have an internal sense within it. How remote this sense is from the sense of the letter is especially evident from 
the names and numbers, for in heaven they pay no attention whatever to names and numbers but to things meant by the names or numbers. For example, whenever the number seven occurs, holiness instantly 
suggests itself to angels instead of the number seven, for 'seven' means holiness from the fact that the celestial man is the seventh day or the sabbath, and so the Lord's rest, <a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a>, <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>. The same applies to all other numbers, for example, to the number twelve. Whenever twelve occurs the idea of everything belonging to faith suggests itself to angels, for the reason that the twelve 
tribes of Israel meant everything belonging to faith, <a href="577.htm">577</a>. That numbers mean real things in the Word has been shown in Volume One; see <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>. </p>

 It is 
similar with the number 'ninety-nine'. That this number means the period of time before the Lord fully joined the Internal Man to the Rational Man is clear from the meaning of 'a hundred years', Abram's 
age when Isaac was born to him, for Isaac represents and means the Lord's Rational Man which was joined to His Internal, that is, to the Divine. In the Word 'a hundred' has the same meaning as ten, 
for that number is the product of ten multiplied by ten, and 'ten' means remnants, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="576.htm">576</a>. For what remnants residing with man are, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, and for what 
remnants residing with the Lord were, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>. These arcana cannot be explained any further, but anyone can find out for himself once he has acquainted himself with what remnants are - for nowadays what 
they are is not known - provided it is realized that by remnants residing with the Lord are meant the Divine Goods which He acquired to Himself by His own power, and by which He united the Human Essence 
to the Divine Essence. </p>

 These considerations show what is meant by 'ninety-nine'. Being one less than a hundred, that number means the period of time before the Lord fully joined the Internal 
Man to the Rational Man. 'Ishmael' represented the first rational with the Lord, the nature of which has been shown adequately enough above in the previous chapter. But 'Isaac' represents the Lord's 
Divine Rational, as will be clear later on. Anyone may see that an arcanum is embodied within the following circumstance: Abram having remained such a long time in the land of Canaan - twenty-four years 
now, ten before Ishmael's birth, and thirteen after- and not as yet having had a son by Sarai his wife, he then first received the promise of a son, when he had now reached ninety-nine and would 
be a hundred when this son was born. The arcanum is that by means of these experiences he might represent the union of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence, and in fact of His Internal Man, 
which was Jehovah, with His Rational. </p>

`Fuit Abram filius nonaginta annorum et novem annorum': quod significet tempus antequam Dominus plene conjunxit Internum Hominem cum Rationali, constat a significatione `novem' cum praecedunt ante decem, 
seu quod idem, `nonaginta novem' ante centum; nam Abram cum ei natus Isacus, erat aetate centum annorum. Qualis sensus internus Verbi est, constare imprimis potest a numeris sicut `nominibus; numeri 
quicumque sunt, in Verbo significant res, sicut etiam nomina, nam nihil usquam in Verbo est in quo non Divinum (o)est, seu quod non internum sensum habet; qui quam remotus sit a sensu litterae, cumprimis 
inde patet; nomina enim et numeri in caelo nusquam attenduntur, sed illa quae per nomina et numeros significantur; sicut pro exemplo, quoties numerus `septem' occurrit, ilico loco septem, sanctum 
obvenit angelis, nam `septem' significant sanctum ex eo quod caelestis homo sit septimus dies seu sabbatum, ita quies Domini, n. 84-87, 395, 433, 716, 881 similiter se habet cum reliquis numeris, 
sicut cum `duodecim,' quoties duodecim occurrunt, obvenit angelis idea omnium quae sunt fidei, ex causa quia duodecim tribus [Israelis] illa significabant, n. 577 quod numeri significent res in Verbo, 
in Parte Prima ostensum videatur n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 893.  [2] Similiter se habet cum numero `nonaginta {1} novem,' qui quod significet tempus antequam Dominus plene conjunxit 
Internum Hominem cum Rationali, constat a significatione `centum annorum,' quos habuit Abram cum ei natus [est] Isacus, per quem repraesentatur et significatur Rationalis Homo Domini qui conjunctus 
Interno Ipsius, hoc est, Divino; `centum' significant (t)idem in Verbo' quod decem, quia (c)ille numerus compositus est a decem in decem multiplicatis, et `decem' significant reliquias, quod in Parte 
Prima ostensum, n. 576; quid reliquiae apud hominem, videatur n. 468, 530, 561, 660, 1050, et quid reliquiae apud Dominum, n. 1906.  Arcana haec non ulterius possunt exponi, sed quisque concludere 
potest, dum prius sibi notum fecerit quid sunt reliquiae; hodie enim quid sunt, ignoratur: modo hoc sciatur quod reliquiae apud Dominum significent Divina Bona quae Ipse sibi propria potentia comparavit, 
per quae Humanum Essentiam univit Divinae: [3] ex his constare potest quid significatur per `nonaginta novem,' quae quia praecedunt centum, significant tempus antequam Dominus plene conjunxit Internum 
Hominem cum Rationali; per `Ismaelem' repraesentatum est primum rationale apud Dominum, quod quale fuit, ostensum satis superque in capite praecedente xvi; at per `Isacum' repraesentatur Rationale 
Domini Divinum, ut in {2} sequentibus constabit.  Quod Abram tam diu moratus in terra Canaane, nunc viginti quattuor annis, decem annis antequam natus Ismael, et postea tredecim annis, et nondum ex 
Sarai uxore habuit filium, sed quod tunc primum promissio facta de filio cum {3} nonaginta novem annorum esset, [et quod filius nasceretur cum esset centum annorum,] quisque videre potest quod arcanum 
involvat; arcanum erat quod repraesentaret per illa unionem Divinae Essentiae Domini cum Ipsius Humana, et quidem Ipsius Interni Hominis, Qui Jehovah, cum Ipsius Rationali. 	@1 et.$ 	@2 a.$ 	@3 i
