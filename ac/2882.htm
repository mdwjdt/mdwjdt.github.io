<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2882节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2882.</strong>人以为他没有任何自由的主要原因是，他已经获知，他凭自己无法行出良善、思想真理。不过，不要让他以为有人拥有或曾经拥有凭自己思想真理、行出良善的任何自由。即便那些因自己所在的完善状态而被称为“神的形像和样式”的人也没有这种自由。因为思想信之真理、行出仁之良善的一切自由都是从主流入的。主是良善本身和真理本身，因此是它们的源头。所有天使都拥有这种自由，事实上拥有一种直觉，即直觉我们刚才所说的这一切都是真理。至内在的天使则发觉有多少来自主，有多少来自他们自己。并且只要来自主，他们就很幸福；而只要来自他们自己，他们就不幸福。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2882</b></p><p><b>2882.</b>
Most of all does man believe that he has no freedom from the fact that he has learned that he cannot do good and think truth of himself. But let him not believe that anyone ever has or ever had any freedom 
of thinking truth and doing good of himself, not even the man who, from the state of perfection in which he was, was called a "likeness and image of God;" for the freedom of thinking the truth 
of faith, and of doing the good of charity, all flows in from the Lord. The Lord is Good itself and Truth itself; and is hence their fountain. All the angels are in such freedom, and indeed in the very 
perception that what we have just stated is the truth. The inmost angels perceive how much is from the Lord, and how much from themselves; and so far as it is from the Lord, they are in happiness; but 
so far as it is from themselves, they are not in what is happy. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2882</b></p><p><b>2882.</b>
The main reason why a person believes that he has no freedom is his awareness that he, of himself, is incapable of doing what is good and thinking what is true. But let him not also believe that anyone 
ever has or has had of himself any freedom to think what is true and to do what is good. Not even those people had that freedom of themselves who, because they were utterly blameless, were called the 
image and likeness of God. But all freedom to think the truth of faith and to do a good deed of charity flows in from the Lord. The Lord is Good itself and Truth itself, and consequently their fountainhead. 
All angels possess that freedom and indeed the perception itself that all that has been said here is so. Inmost angels perceive how much comes from the Lord and how much from themselves, but 
that insofar as it comes from the Lord they know happiness and insofar as it comes from themselves they do not. </p>

</p><b>2882.</b>
{1}  Imprimis credit homo se nullum liberum habere, quia ex se bonum agere et verum cogitare non posse novit; sed ne credat quod usquam aliquis habeat ac habuerit aliquod liberum cogitandi verum et faciendi 
bonum ex se, ne quidem homo qui ex integritate in qua fuit, similitudo et imago Dei dictus; {2}sed  liberum cogitandi verum quod est fidei, et faciendi bonum quod est charitatis, omne influit 
a Domino; Dominus est ipsum Bonum et ipsum Verum, inde fons:  omnes angeli in tali libero sunt, immo in ipsa perceptione quod ita sit; angeli intimi percipiunt quantum a Domino, {3}et quantum a semet, 
at quantum a Domino tantum in felici sunt, et quantum a semet tantum non in felici. @1 written after 2893 with directions for insertion here.$ @2 i quicquid enim a se est malum et falsum.$ @3 at I$ </p>
