<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2595节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2595.</strong>有一次，我听见一种回旋音，声音还算悦耳，但比正常的回旋音要尖锐些。我从他们的声音立刻判断出他们是外邦人。天使告诉我说，他们是三、四天前死后复活的外邦人。我听到这回旋音或和声持续了数小时，并发觉，在极短的时间内，就听到他们表现得越来越完美。正当我对此感到诧异时，我被告知，这些人能在一个晚上组成合唱团，从而组成和谐的团队，而绝大多数基督徒三十年内也未必能行。回旋音或和声只有很多人同时说话时才能形成，并且全体如同一个，每一个如同全体。蒙主怜悯，关于回旋音或和声容后再述。<br />备注：灵界日记3494节提到，这些外邦人是伊斯兰教徒。</p>

I heard the sound of a certain gyre,* but coarser than usual, and from the sound I at once knew that they were from the Gentiles. I was told by the angels that they were Gentiles who had been raised 
up three or four days before. The gyre or choir was heard for several hours, and it was perceived that even during the short time in which it was heard they were being perfected more and more. When I 
wondered at this I was told that these can be initiated into choirs, and thus into harmony, in one night; while most Christians barely can in thirty years. Gyres or choirs exist when many speak together, 
all as one, and each as all; but concerning gyres or choirs, of the Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere. * That is, a revolving circle, or gyration. See Arcana Coelestia, n. 4041, 5182, etc. [REVISER.] </p>

I was once listening to a certain gyre which sounded tuneful yet harsher than gyres normally do. From their sound I recognized straightaway that they came from the gentiles.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Angels told me that they 
were gentiles who had been raised from the dead three or four days previously. I listened to this gyre or choir for many hours and perceived that throughout the short period I was listening to them they 
were being perfected more and more. Wondering at this I was told that these people can be inaugurated into choirs, and so into harmonious groups, within a single night, whereas with the majority of 
Christians the same is scarcely possible within thirty years. Gyres or choirs exist when many speak simultaneously, all as one, and each as all. But gyres or choirs will in the Lord's Divine mercy be 
described elsewhere.

Audiebam gyrum quendam sonorum, sed crassiorem solito; ex sonoro ilico cognovi quod ex gentibus essent; dicebatur mihi ab angelis quod essent gentiles, qui ante tres vel {1} quatuor dies resuscitati 
sunt; audiebatur gyrus vel {2} chorus per plures horas, et perceptum quod etiam per breve illud tempus quo audiebatur, magis et magis perficerentur; quod cum miratus, dicebatur quod illi in choros, ita 
in consensus, possint initiari per unam noctem, cum plerique Christiani vix per triginta annos: gyri seu chori sunt cum loquantur plures simul, omnes sicut unus, et unusquisque sicut omnes: sed de 
gyris seu choris, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi dicetur. 	@1 et.$ 	@2 seu.$ </p>
