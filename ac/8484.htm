<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8484节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8484.</strong>出埃及记16:21-24.他们每日早晨按着各人所吃的饭量收集吗哪，日头一发热，它就融化了。到第六天，他们收集了双倍的食物，每人两俄梅珥。会众所有的首领来告诉摩西。摩西对他们说，耶和华所说的是这样：明天是一个安息日，向耶和华守的一个圣安息日，你们要烤的就烤了，要煮的就煮了，所剩下的要给自己留着，存放到早晨。他们就照摩西的吩咐留到早晨，也不臭，里头也没有虫子。<br />“他们每日早晨收集吗哪”表不断从主领受良善。“按着各人所吃的饭量”表各人照着各自把它变成自己的那种能力。“日头一发热，它就融化了”表它照着贪欲增长的程度而逐渐消失。“到第六天”表在每个状态结束的时候。“他们收集了双倍的食物”表由所领受的良善产生的结合。“每人两俄梅珥”表那时的能力。“会众所有的首领来告诉摩西”表基于首要真理的反思。“摩西对他们说”表指示。“耶和华所说的是这样”表来自神性的流注。“一个安息日”表当没有试探时的一种平安状态。“明天是向耶和华守的一个圣安息日”表良善和真理的永恒结合。“你们要烤的就烤了”表为良善的结合做好准备。“要煮的就煮了”表为真理的结合做好准备。“所剩下的要给自己留着，存放到早晨”表那时仿佛来自他们自己之物的一切良善和真理的享受。“他们就留到早晨”表将要到来的享受。“照摩西的吩咐”表照着从神之真理所领受的指示。“也不臭，里头也没有虫子”表它里面没有丝毫污秽之物，因为它以这种方式被主或神性变成他们自己的。</p>

Verses 21-24. And they gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to the mouth of his eating: and the sun grew hot and it melted. And it was that on the sixth day they gathered bread double, 
two omers for each one; and all the princes of the assemblage came and told Moses. And he said unto them, This is what Jehovah spake, A rest, a Sabbath holy to Jehovah, is the morrow; what ye will bake, 
bake ye; and what ye will boil, boil ye; and all that is left over, this lay ye by for you to keep until the morning. And they laid it by till the morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink, 
and the worm was not in it. "And they gathered it morning by morning," signifies the reception of good from the Lord continually; "every man according to the mouth of his eating," signifies by everyone 
according to his power of appropriation; "and the sun grew hot and it melted," signifies that it vanishes away according to the degree of the increase of concupiscence; "and it was on the sixth day," 
signifies at the end of every state; "they gathered bread double," signifies conjunction from the good received; "two omers for each one," signifies power then; "and all the princes of the assemblage 
came and told Moses," signifies reflection from primary truths; "and he said unto them," signifies instruction; "This is what Jehovah spake," signifies influx from the Divine; "a rest," signifies 
a state of peace when there is no temptation; "a Sabbath holy to Jehovah is the morrow," signifies the conjunction of good and truth to eternity; "what ye will bake, bake ye," signifies preparation for 
the conjunction of good; "and what ye will boil, boil ye," signifies preparation for the conjunction of truth; "and all that is left over, this lay ye by for you to keep until the morning," signifies 
the enjoyment of all good and truth then as it were from their own; "and they laid it by till the morning," signifies the enjoyment that is to come; "as Moses commanded," signifies according to instruction 
from truth Divine; "and it did not stink, and the worm was not in it," signifies that there was nothing filthy therein, because in this way it was made their own by the Lord. </p>

Verses 21-24 And they gathered it morning by morning, each according to the mouth of his eating; and the sun grew hot, and it melted. And so it was, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much 
bread, two omers for each one; and all the princes of the assembly came and told Moses. And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has spoken: [A day of] rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah shall tomorrow 
be. Bake what you will bake, and boil what you will boil; and all that is left over put aside for yourselves to keep until the morning. And they put it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded; and 
it did not become putrid, and there was no worm in it. </p>
<p>'And they gathered it morning by morning' means the reception of good from the Lord unceasingly. 'Each according to the mouth of his eating' means 
each according to his capacity to make it his own. 'And the sun grew hot, and it melted' means its disappearance gradually as craving increased. 'And so it was, that on the sixth day' means at the 
end of each state. 'They gathered twice as much' means the joining together resulting from the reception of good. 'Two omers for each one' means the power present then. 'And all the princes of the assembly 
came and told Moses' means reflection on the basis of primary truths. 'And he said to them' means instruction. 'This is what Jehovah has spoken' means influx from the Divine. '[A day of] rest' 
means a state of peace when there is no temptation. 'A holy sabbath to Jehovah shall tomorrow be' means the joining together of goodness and truth into eternity. 'Bake what you will bake' means preparing 
good to be joined. 'And boil what you will boil' means preparing truth to be joined. 'And all that is left over put aside for yourselves to keep until the morning' means the enjoyment of all good 
and truth then as if from what was their own. 'And they put it aside till the morning' means the enjoyment to come. 'As Moses commanded' means in accordance with instruction received from God's truth. 
'And it did not become putrid, and there was no worm in it' means that there was nothing foul within it, because in that way they acted from the Divine in making it their own. </p>

Vers. 21-24.  Et collegerunt illud mane mane, quisque secundum os edere sui; et incaluit sol et liquefactum est.  Et fuit in die sexto collegerunt panem duplum, duos omeres uni; et venerunt omnes principes 
coetus, et indicaverunt Moschi.  Et dixit ad illos, Hoc quod locutus Jehovah, Requies, sabbatum sanctum Jehovae cras; quod coquetis coquite, et quod elixabitis elixate, et omne superfluum reponite 
hoc vobis ad custodiam usque ad mane.  Et reposuerunt illud ad mane, quemadmodum praecepit Moscheh, et non computruit, et vermis non fuit in illo.  `Et collegerunt illud mane mane' significat receptionem 
boni a Domino jugiter: `quisque secundum os edere ejus' significat cuique secundum potentiam appropriationis: `et incaluit sol et liquefactum est' significat quod evanescat secundum gradum crescentis 
concupiscentiae: {1} `et fuit in die sexto' (x)significat ad finem cujusvis status: `collegerunt duplum' significat conjunctionem ex bono recepto: `duos omeres uni' significat potentiam tunc: 
`et venerunt omnes principes coetus, et indicaverunt Moschi' significat reflexionem ex primariis veris: `et dixit ad illos' significat instructionem: `Hoc quod locutus Jehovah' significat influxum a 
Divino: `Requies' significat statum pacis cum non tentatio: `sabbatum sanctum Jehovae cras' significat conjunctionem boni et veri in aeternum: `quod coquetis coquite' significat praeparationem ad conjunctionem 
boni: `et quod elixabitis (x)elixate' significat praeparationem ad conjunctionem veri: `et omne superfluum (x)reponite hoc vobis ad custodiam usque ad mane' significat fruitionem omnis boni 
et veri tunc sicut ex proprio: `et reposuerunt illud ad mane' significat fruitionem venturam: `quemadmodum praecepit Moscheh' significat secundum instructionem a vero Divino: `et non computruit, et vermis 
non fuit in eo' significat quod nihil spurci inesset, quia appropriatum ita a {2}Divino. 	@1 i Psalm. cxlvii 14 ad 19; Num. xi 6, Cap. xxi 4 ad 10; Deut. viii 2, 3; Deut. xvi 3, 6.$ 	@2 Domino IT$ </p>
