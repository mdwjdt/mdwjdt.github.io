<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7272.</strong>“我要使法老的心刚硬”表由虚假的邪恶所生的固执。这从“刚硬”的含义清楚可知。“刚硬”是指固执；“法老的心”表示它是由虚假的邪恶产生的，因为“心”在正面意义上表示属天之爱的良善（参看<a href="3313.htm">3313</a>，<a href="3887.htm">3887</a>，<a href="3889.htm">3889</a>节），因此在反面意义上表示地狱的邪恶。它之所以表示虚假的邪恶，是因为“法老”代表那些沉浸于虚假的人。虚假的邪恶是指源于虚假的基本观念的东西。以诸如存在于以色列人和犹太人当中的观念为例：他们通过外在行为，即通过祭祀、洗礼或洒血而变得神圣；他们不会通过仁与信变得神圣；因此，他们是神圣的，即便他们的生活充满仇恨、报复、掠夺、残忍等等。这些邪恶被称为“虚假的邪恶”，因为它们源于虚假的基本观念。<br />另举一例，就是相信唯信得救，仁爱的行为丝毫无助于救恩的人，以及相信他甚至在死前的最后一刻也能得救，无论他整个一生过得是什么样的生活的人。如果他基于这些观念过着缺乏任何仁爱的生活，充满对他人的蔑视，对凡不尊重的人充满敌意和仇恨，想要报复，渴望剥夺他人的财物，缺乏怜悯，充满诡诈和欺骗，那么这些邪恶也是虚假的邪恶。它们之所以是虚假的邪恶，是因为他基于一种虚假使自己要么确信它们不是邪恶，要么确信它们即便是邪恶，也能被抹去，只要在咽下最后一口气之前，他以明显的信心宣告他的信仰，即：主是中保，那罪已通过祂的十字架受难被抹去。<br />再举一例，就是那些靠近死人，祈求他们如同祈求圣徒，进而崇拜他们，甚至崇拜他们的像之人。这种敬拜的邪恶 就是虚假的邪恶。那些行虚假的邪恶之人都相信虚假是真理，进而相信邪恶要么不是邪恶，要么不可能招致诅咒。那些以为罪能被人赦免，以及那些以为他们能被带进天堂，无论他们的罪如何，也就是说，无论他们的属灵污秽和恶臭如何的人也一样。简言之，虚假的邪恶数量和信仰并敬拜的虚假一样多。这些邪恶确实会招致定罪，只是在程度上不如源于邪恶的邪恶那么大。源于邪恶的邪恶是指那些由于从爱自己爱世界涌出的欲望而存在的邪恶。</p>

And I will harden Pharaoh's heart. That this signifies obstinacy from the evil of falsity, is evident from the signification of "hardening," as being obstinacy; that it denotes from the evil of falsity, 
is signified by the "heart of Pharaoh," for by "heart" in the genuine sense is signified the good of celestial love (see n. 3313, 3887, 3889), and therefore in the opposite sense it denotes infernal 
evil; that it denotes the evil of falsity is because by Pharaoh are represented those who are in falsity. The evil of falsity is that which takes its origin from principles of falsity, such as, for 
example, that men would become holy through external things, as in the case of the Israelites and Jews through sacrifices, washings, sprinkling of blood; and that they would not become holy through charity 
and faith; and thus that they would be holy although they lived in hatred, revenge, robbery, cruelty, and the like. These evils are called "evils of falsity," because they take their origin from 
principles of falsity. [2] Take also as an example one who believes that faith alone saves, and that works of charity effect nothing for salvation; and also of one who believes that he may be saved 
even in the hour of death, howsoever he had lived during the whole course of his life, and from these principles lives without any charity, in contempt of others, in enmity and hatred against everyone 
who does not treat him with honor, in the desire of revenge, in the lust of depriving others of their goods, in unmercifulness, cunning, and deceit. These evils also are evils of falsity, because from 
falsity he has persuaded himself either that they are not evils, or that if they were evils, they would nevertheless be wiped away, provided that before breathing his last he should confess from apparent 
confidence the mediation of the Lord, and the wiping away of sins through the passion of His cross.  [3] Take also as an example those who in supplication approach dead men as saints, and thus 
adore them, and also their images; the evil of this worship is evil of falsity. They who do the evil of falsity, all believe that falsity is truth, and consequently that evil is either not evil, or is 
not condemnatory. In like manner those who believe that sins can be pardoned by men; and also those who believe that they can be introduced into heaven, in whatsoever sins they have been, that is, in 
whatsoever spiritual foulness and rottenness. In a word, the evils of falsity are as many as are the falsities of faith and of worship. These evils condemn, yet not so much as do the evils which originate 
in evil. The evils which originate in evil are those which are from cupidity rising up from the love of self and of the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7272</b></p><p><b>7272.</b>
'And I will harden Pharaoh's heart' means obstinacy rising from the evil of falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'hardening' as obstinacy. Its rise from the evil of falsity is meant by 'Pharaoh's 
heart', for in the genuine sense 'the heart' means the good which belongs to heavenly love, <a href="3313.htm">3313</a>, <a href="3887.htm">3887</a>, <a href="3889.htm">3889</a>, and therefore in the contrary sense it means hellish evil. And the reason why it is the 
evil of falsity is that 'Pharaoh' represents those who are steeped in falsity. The evil of falsity is anything which traces its origin back to basic ideas of falsity. Take for example the idea, such 
as existed among the Israelites and Jews, that they were made holy by means of external acts - by sacrifices, washings, or the sprinkling of blood - and that they were not made holy through charity and 
faith, thus that they were holy even though their lives were filled with hatred, vengeance, plundering, savagery, and the like. These evils are what are called the evils of falsity, because they trace 
their origin back to basic ideas of falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Take as another example a person who believes that faith alone saves and that the works of charity contribute nothing to salvation, a person who 
also believes that he can be saved even in his final hour before death, no matter what kind of life he has been leading throughout the whole course of his life. If on the basis of these ideas he leads 
a life devoid of any charity and is filled with contempt for others, enmity and hatred towards anyone who does not pay him respect, the desire for revenge, the craving to deprive others of their goods, 
lack of pity, trickery, and deceit, these evils too are evils of falsity. They are such because he convinces himself on the basis of a falsity either that they are not evils or that even if they were 
evils they would nevertheless be purged, provided that before he breathed his last he declared with apparent trust his belief that the Lord is the Mediator and that sins are purged through His passion 
on the Cross. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take as yet another example those who approach people who have died, make supplication to them as saints, and so venerate them, even images of them. The evil contained in that 
practice is the evil of falsity. Doers of the evil of falsity all believe that falsity is the truth, and consequently that evil either is not evil or else cannot cause damnation. It is similar with those 
who believe that sins can be pardoned by mere human beings, and also with those who believe that they can be brought into heaven, regardless of their sins, that is, of their foul spiritual odour 
and stench. In short the evils of falsity are as many in number as the falsities of faith and worship. Such evils do cause condemnation, but not to so great an extent as evils that have their origin in 
evil. Evils that have their origin in evil are those which exist as a result of a desire welling up from self-love and love of the world. </p>

`Et Ego obdurabo cor Pharaonis':  quod significet obstinationem a malo falsi, constat a significatione `obdurare' quod sit obstinatio; quod sit a malo falsi, significatur per cor Pharaonis,' per `cor' 
enim in genuino sensu significatur bonum quod est amoris caelestis, n. 3313, 3887, 3889, inde in opposito sensu est malum infernale; quod sit malum falsi, est quia per `Pharaonem' repraesentantur illi 
qui in falso.  (s)Malum falsi est quod originem (c)ex principiis falsi ducit; sicut pro exemplo quod {1}sanctificarentur per externa, sicut apud Israelitas et Judaeos {2} per sacrificia, per lavationes, 
per aspersionem sanguinis, {3} et quod non sanctificarentur per charitatem et fidem, et sic quod {4}sancti essent, tametsi viverent in odiis, in vindictis, in rapinis, in saevitiis, et similibus; 
haec mala sunt quae vocantur mala falsi quia originem ex principiis falsi ducunt. 	2 Sit quoque pro exemplo qui credit quod sola fides salvet, et quod ad salutem opera charitatis nihil faciant; tum 
quoque qui credit quod salvetur {5} etiam in ultima mortis hora, {6}qualitercumque per integrum vitae suae curriculum {7}vixerat; et ex principiis illis vivit absque ulla charitate, in contemptu aliorum, 
in inimicitia et odio contra quemcumque qui non illum colit, in cupiditate vindictae, {8}in concupiscentia deprivandi alios suis bonis, in immisericordia, in astu, in dolo; haec mala sunt quoque 
mala falsi, quia ex falso sibi persuasit {9}sive quod mala non sint, sive si vel forent mala, quod usque {10}abstergerentur, modo ante exspirationem ex apparente confidentia {11}confiteretur mediationem 
Domini, et abstersionem peccatorum per passionem crucis Ipsius. 	3 Sit quoque {12}pro exemplo qui homines mortuos ut sanctos supplicatione adeunt, et sic illos adorant, etiam imagines illorum, malum 
illius cultus est malum falsi.  Qui malum falsi agunt, omnes credunt falsum esse verum, et consequenter malum (d)vel non esse malum, vel non esse damnabile.  Similiter qui credunt peccata condonari 
posse ab hominibus; tum qui credunt se introduci posse in caelum, in quibuscumque peccatis {13}fuerint, hoc est, in qualicumque fetore et putore spirituali.  Verbo, mala falsi sunt totidem quot falsa 
fidei et cultus; haec mala condemnant, sed non in tantum in quantum mala ex origine mali; mala ex origine mali sunt quae ex {14} cupiditate exsurgente ex amore sui et mundi.(s) 	@1 cultus divinus consistat 
in externis ritibus$ 	@2 i quod sanctificarentur$ 	@3 i et per venerationem sanctam pro arca, pro templo, pro Urim et Thumim, proque vestibus sanctitatis Summi Sacerdotis, et pluribus aliis,$ 	@4 
illis licita essent odia, et vindictae, tum quoque rapinae et saevitiae, et plura$ 	@5 i homo$ 	@6 utcunque$ 	@7 vixerit$ 	@8 inque$ 	@9 quod vel malum non sit, aut si foret malum$ 	@10
