<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7360.</strong>我由此得以知道，火星居民的言语不同于我们地球居民的。也就是说，它是听不见的，实际上是无声的，经由很短的途径进入内在听觉和视觉。它因具有这种性质而更完全、更完美、更充满思维观念，因而更接近灵人和天使的言语。其言语所包含的真正情感就表现在他们脸上，而包含在它里面的思维表现在他们眼里。因为对他们来说，思维和言语，以及情感和面部表情行如一体。他们认为想一套，说一套，意愿一套，脸上却表现另一套是邪恶的。他们不知道什么叫假冒为善或诡诈、伪装和欺骗。</p>

From all this it was given me to know that the speech of the inhabitants of Mars is different from the speech of the inhabitants of our earth. That is to say, it was not sonorous, but almost silent, 
insinuating itself into the interior hearing and sight by a shorter way. And being of this nature, it was fuller and more perfect, fuller of the ideas of thought, thus approaching more nearly the speech 
of spirits and angels. Moreover, the very affection of the speech is represented with them in the face, and its thought in the eyes; for with them, thought and speech, and also affection and face, 
act as a one. They regard it as wicked to think one thing and speak another, and to will one thing and show another in the face. They do not know what hypocrisy is, or what fraudulent deceit and dissimulation are. </p>

From all this I was allowed to know that the speech of the inhabitants of Mars was different from that of the inhabitants of our planet. That is to say, it was not audible but virtually soundless, introducing 
itself into inward hearing and sight by a shorter route, and being of such a nature was fuller and more perfect - fuller of ideas comprising thought - and so was by nature closer to the speech 
of spirits and angels. The actual affections which their speech contains are represented in their faces, while the thought contained in it is represented in their eyes. For with those people thought 
and speech act in unison with each other, as do affection and facial expressions. They consider it wicked to think one thing but say another, and to desire one thing but express another on their faces. 
They do not know what hypocrisy is, or what fraudulent pretence and deception are. </p>

</p><b>7360.</b>
Ex his scite datum est quod loquela incolarum Martis diversa esset a loquela incolarum nostrae telluris, quod nempe non sonora, sed paene tacita, se in auditum et visum interiorem per breviorem viam 
insinuans; et quia talis quod plenior et perfectior esset, plenior ideis cogitationis, ita propius accedens ad loquelam spirituum et angelorum; ipsa etiam loquelae affectio repraesentatur apud illos 
in facie, et ejus cogitatio in oculis; nam cogitatio et loquela, tum affectio et facies, apud illos unum agunt; reputant pro nefario aliud cogitare et aliud loqui, ac aliud velle et aliud facie ostendere; 
non sciunt quid hypocrisis, et quid simulatio fraudulenta (c)ac dolus. </p>
