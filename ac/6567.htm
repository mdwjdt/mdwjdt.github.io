<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6567节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6567.</strong>“他的哥哥们又来俯伏在他面前”表属世层中的事物顺服于内在。这从以色列的儿子们和约瑟的代表，以及“俯伏在他面前”的含义清楚可知：以色列的儿子们，即此处的“哥哥们”，是指属世层中的属灵真理（参看<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>节）；“俯伏在他面前”是指顺服；约瑟是指内在（<a href="6499.htm">6499</a>节）。由此明显可知，“他的哥哥们又来俯伏在他面前”表示属世层中的事物顺服于内在。本章描述了一个属灵教会的建立，此处则描述了属世层中的事物顺服于内在。至于这种顺服，要知道，属灵教会绝无可能建立在任何人里面，除非属于属世人或外在人的事物已经顺服于属灵人或内在人。只要在一个人那里占主导地位的，单单是信之真理，却没有仁之良善，属世人或外在人就不会顺服于属灵人或内在人；不过，一旦良善掌权，属世人或外在人就会顺服，这时此人就成为一个属灵教会。<br />情况的确如此，这一点从以下事实可以得知：这样的人会出于情感去行真理的教导，他不会违背这种情感行事，无论属世人如何渴望它。这种情感和它所产生的推理能力在他里面掌权，并征服属世层中爱自己爱世界的快乐，以及充满那里的记忆知识的谬论；最终征服得如此彻底，以致这种征服成为了此人的一大乐事。此时，属世人变得安静，之后变得与内在人一致；当它与内在人一致时，就会分享内在人的愉悦。由此可知当如何理解“他的哥哥们又来俯伏在他面前，说，看哪，我们是你的仆人”所表示的属世层中的事物对于内在的这种顺服。</p>

And his brethren also went and fell down before him. That this signifies submission of the things that are in the natural under the internal, is evident from the representation of the sons of Israel, 
who here are the "brethren," as being spiritual truths in the natural (see n. 5414, 5879, 5951); from the signification of "falling down before him," as being submission; and from the representation 
of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6499). From this it is plain that by his "brethren went and fell down before him" is signified the submission of the things that are in the natural under the internal. 
In this chapter is described the setting up again of a spiritual church, and in this passage the submission of the things in the natural under the internal; of which submission be it known that the 
spiritual church cannot possibly be instituted with anyone, unless the things that belong to the natural or external man have been made submissive to the spiritual or internal man. So long as the mere 
truth which is of faith predominates with a man, and not the good which is of charity, so long the natural or external man has not been made submissive to the spiritual or internal man. But as soon 
as good has the dominion, the natural or external man submits himself, and then the man becomes a spiritual church. That such is the case is known from the fact that the man does from affection what 
the truth teaches, and that he does not act contrary to this affection, however the natural desires it. The very affection and consequent reason have the dominion, and subdue in the natural the delights 
of the love of self and of the world, as also the fallacies which had filled the memory-knowledges there; and at last so completely that this subjugation comes to be among the man's pleasures; and 
then the natural is at rest, and afterward is in agreement; and when it is in agreement, it then partakes of the pleasantness of the internal. From all this it may be known what is meant by the submission 
of the things in the natural under the internal, which is signified by "his brethren went and fell down before him, and said, Behold we are thy servants." </p>

'And his brothers also went and fell down before him' means the submission of the things in the natural [to the internal]. This is clear from the representation of the sons of Israel, to whom 'brothers' 
refers here, as spiritual truths in the natural, dealt with in <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>; from the meaning of 'fell down before him' as submission; and from the representation of Joseph as the internal, dealt 
with in <a href="6499.htm">6499</a>. From this it is evident that 'his brothers went and fell down before him' means the submission of the things in the natural to the internal. The subject in this chapter is the establishing 
of a spiritual Church, and at this point the submission of the things that are in the natural to the internal. In considering this submission it should be recognized that a spiritual Church cannot 
possibly be established with anyone unless the things that belong to the natural or external man have been made submissive to the spiritual or internal man. As long as solely the truth of faith holds 
sway with a person, and not the good of charity, the natural or external man has not been made submissive to the spiritual or internal man; but as soon as good reigns, the natural or external man 
submits, and then that person becomes a spiritual Church. </p>

 One recognizes the truth of this from the fact that such a person does from affection what truth teaches, and does not act contrary to 
that affection, no matter how much the natural desires it. That affection and the power of reason arising from it is what reigns in him, bringing under its control in the natural the delights of self-love 
and love of the world as well as the false notions that have permeated the factual knowledge there. At length that control is so complete that it becomes a matter of pleasure to the person. The natural 
now grows quiet, and after that comes into agreement with the internal; and when it is in agreement it shares the internal's feeling of pleasure. From all this one may see how to understand the 
submission of the things in the natural to the internal, meant by 'his brothers went and fell down before him, and said, Behold, we are your slaves'.  </p>

`Et iverunt etiam fratres ejus, et ceciderunt coram eo quod significet submissionem illorum quae in naturali, constat ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' qui hic `fratres', quod sint vera spiritualia 
in naturali, de qua n. 5414, 5879, 5951; ex significatione `ceciderunt coram eo' quod sit submissio; et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit internum, de qua n. 6499; inde patet quod per `iverunt 
fratres ejus et ceciderunt coram eo' significetur submissio illorum quae in naturali sub interno.  Agitur in hoc capite de instauratione Ecclesiae spiritualis, et hic nunc de submissione illorum quae 
ii, naturali sub interno, de qua submissione sciendum quod Ecclesia spiritualis nullatenus apud aliquem possit institui, nisi illa quae sunt naturalis seu externi hominis submissa fuerint spirituali 
seu interno homini; quamdiu solum verum quod fidei praedominatur apud hominem, et non bonum quod est charitatis, tamdiu naturalis seu externus homo non submissus est spirituali seu interno; ast ut 
primum bonum dominatur, submittit se naturalis seu externus homo, et tunc fit homo ille Ecclesia spiritualis.  [2] Quod ita sit, cognoscitur ex eo quod ex affectione faciat quod verum docet, et quod non 
contra affectionem illam, utcumque naturale cupit; ipsa affectio et inde ratio dominatur, et subjugat in naturali jucunda amoris sui et mundi, ut et fallacias quae impleverunt scientifica ibi; et tandem 
ita ut inter amoena ejus sit subjugatio illa, et tunc naturale quiescit, et dein concordat, et cum concordat tunc participat de amoeno interni.  Ex his sciri potest quid intelligitur per submissionem 
illorum quae in naturali sub interno, quae significantur per `iverunt fratres ejus, et ceciderunt coram eo, et dixerunt, Ecce nos tibi ad servos'. </p>
