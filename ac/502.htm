<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第502节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>502.</strong>这三个教会，即亚当（MAN）、塞特和以挪士构成上古教会。尽管如此，它们在直觉方面的完美程度却不同。在这些教会中，第一个教会的直觉在后续教会中逐渐削弱，变得越来越一般，其变化的方式如同上面提到的果实或种子、大脑。完美在于清晰的直觉，当直觉变得越来越模糊和普通时，这种完美就逐渐减弱。此时，模糊的直觉代替清晰的直觉，并因此开始消失。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]502.</strong> These three churches — the human, Seth, and Enosh — constitute the earliest church, although there were differences in how perfectly each of the three perceived things. The first church's perceptivity lessened in all the ensuing churches and became more general, as just described in regard to the fruit or seed, or the brain. Perfection consists in the ability to perceive minute distinctions, and this perfection decreases when the ability is not so refined but more general. A dimmer kind of perception then takes the place of the clearer kind, and in this way perception begins to disappear. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 502</b></p><p><b>502.</b>
These three churches, "Man" "Seth" and "Enosh" constitute the Most Ancient Church, but still with a difference of perfection as to perceptions: the perceptive faculty of the first church gradually diminished 
in the succeeding churches, and became more general, as observed concerning fruit or its seed, and concerning the brain. Perfection consists in the faculty of perceiving distinctly, which faculty 
is diminished when the perception is less distinct and more general; an obscurer perception then succeeds in the place of that which was clearer, and thus it begins to vanish away. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 502</b></p><p><b>502.</b>
Those three churches - Man, Seth, and Enosh - constitute the Most Ancient Church. Nevertheless they had different degrees of perfection as regards perception. The perceptivity found in the first of these 
Churches everywhere grew less in those that followed until it became something rather general, in the way mentioned above concerning fruit or seed, or concerning the brain. Perfection consists in 
an ability to perceive very clearly, and is diminished when perception is less clear and more general. At that point vaguer perception takes the place of clearer and so starts to disappear.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 502</b>
</p><b>502.</b>
Tres illae Ecclesiae, 'Homo, Sheth et Enosh,' constituunt Antiquissimam, usque cum differentia perfectionis quoad perceptione perceptivum primae Ecclesiae passim diminutum est in sequentibus et factum 
communius; sicut, ut dictum, de fructu aut semine, aut de cerebro; perfectio consistit in facultate distincte percipiendi, quae diminuitur cum non ita distincte sed communius; tunc loco clarioris perceptionis 
succedit obscurior, et sic incipit evanescere. </p>
