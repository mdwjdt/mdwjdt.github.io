<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4581节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4581.</strong>“在那上头奠酒”表真理的神性良善。这从“奠酒”的含义清楚可知，“奠酒”是指真理的神性良善，如下文所述。不过，我必须首先说一说何为真理的良善。真理之良善在别处被称为信之良善，也就是对邻之爱，或仁爱。有两种普遍的良善，其中一种被称为信之良善，另一种被称为爱之良善。“奠酒”表示信之良善，“油”表示爱之良善。那些被主经由内在途径带入良善的人处于爱之良善，而那些被主经由外在途径带入良善的人处于信之良善。属天教会成员，以及至内在或第三层天的天使处于爱之良善；而属灵教会成员，以及中间或第二层天的天使则处于信之良善。因此，前一种良善被称为属天良善，后一种良善被称为属灵良善。这二者之间的区别就是出于良善的意愿而意愿良善与出于对良善的理解而意愿良善之间的区别。因此，后一种，也就是属灵良善，或信之良善，或真理之良善就是“奠酒”所表示的；而前一种，也就是属天良善，或爱之良善则是“油”在内义上所表示的。<br />诚然，若不凭借内义，没有人能看出“油”和“奠酒”表示这类事物；然而，谁都能看出，它们代表神圣事物，因为若非它们代表这些神圣事物，那么在一根柱子上奠酒或浇油不就是某种可笑的偶像崇拜行为吗？这就像国王的加冕礼。在这种场合所举行的仪式，如：把王冠戴在他头上；把油从角中倒在他前额、手腕上膏抹他；把权杖、剑和钥匙递到他手上；给他穿上紫袍，然后让他坐到银色宝座上，之后他穿着这些服饰骑在马上，再后来在席上被显贵人侍奉，以及其它许多仪式，若非表示并意味着神圣事物，又会是什么呢？这一切仪式若非代表神圣事物，凭它们与天堂、因而教会的事物相对应而神圣庄严，不过是小孩子的游戏，只是规模大点而已，或像舞台上的表演。<br />但所有这些仪式都能追溯到上古时代，那时，仪式凭它们代表神圣事物，以及与天堂、因而教会中的神圣事物对应而神圣。即便如今，它们被视为神圣，也不是因为人们知道它们代表什么，或对应什么，而是通过可以说对所使用符号的解释。然而，倘若人们知道王冠、油、角、权杖、剑、钥匙、紫袍、银王座、骑在白马上、吃饭的时候由显贵人侍候，这一切都代表什么，各自又对应什么样的神圣事物，他们就会以一种更神圣的方式来思想这些事物。可他们不知道，说来奇怪，他们竟然不想知道；事实上，这种知识已经匮乏到包含在这类仪式和圣言每一部分中的代表和有意义的符号已经从当今之人的脑海中抹去的地步。<br />“奠酒”表示真理之良善，或属灵良善，这一点从奠酒所用的祭物可以看出来。献祭的时候，祭物来自牛群，要么来自羊群，代表对主的内在敬拜（<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2805.htm">2805</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节）。在这些祭物上再添加素祭和奠祭。素祭由细面粉调油制成，表示属天的良善，或也可说，爱之良善，“油”表示对主之爱，“细面粉”表示对邻之仁。但奠祭由酒构成，表示属灵的良善，或也可说，信之良善。因此，这二者，即素祭和奠祭，一起与圣餐中的饼和酒所表相同。<br />素祭和奠祭添加到燔祭和祭物上，这一事实清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />你每天常献上两只一岁的羊羔；早晨要献这一只，黄昏的时候要献那一只。和这一只羊羔同献的，要用细面伊法十分之一与捣成的油一欣四分之一调和，又用酒一欣四分之一作为奠祭；那一只羊羔也是这样。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.38.htm">29:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.41.htm">41</a>）<br /><br />摇这捆初熟谷物的日子，你们要把一岁、没有残疾的公绵羊羔献给耶和华为燔祭。同献的素祭，就是调油的细面伊法十分之二；同献的奠祭，要酒一欣四分之一。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.12.htm">23:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.18.htm">18</a>）<br /><br />离俗人离俗的日子足满的那一天，他要将供物（祭物）奉给耶和华，一筐子无酵调油的细面饼与抹油的无酵薄饼，并同献的素祭和奠祭。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.13.htm">6:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.17.htm">17</a>）<br /><br />那献燔祭的，就要将细面伊法十分之一，并油一欣四分之一，调和作素祭；一同预备奠祭的酒一欣四分之一，为公绵羊的燔祭以一种方式，为公牛的燔祭以另一种方式。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.3.htm">15:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.11.htm">11</a>）<br />要与每天例常献的燔祭一同献上奠祭，为这一只羊羔，要同献酒一欣四分之一；在圣所中，你要将醇酒奉给耶和华为奠祭。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.6.htm">28:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此外，关于各种祭物中的素祭和奠祭，可参看民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.7.htm">28:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.1.htm">29:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.40.htm">40</a>）。<br />素祭和奠祭就具有这样的含义，这一点可从以下事实看出来：爱与信构成敬拜的一切事物；在圣餐中，“饼”（就是前面所描述的细面调和油制成的饼）和酒表示爱与信，因而表示敬拜的一切事物，如前所述（<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="2359.htm">2359</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>节）。<br />但当人们逐渐远离对主之敬拜的纯正代表，转向别神，并向他们奠酒时，奠酒或奠祭就表示与仁和信对立的事物，也就是尘世之爱的邪恶与虚假；如以赛亚书：<br />你们在各青翠树下的诸神当中欲火焚烧。你也向他们浇了奠祭、献了素祭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.5.htm">57:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“在诸神当中欲火焚烧”表示对虚假的贪恋，“诸神”表示虚假（<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>e节）。“各青翠树下”表示对一切虚假的信靠（<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>节）。“向他们浇了奠祭、献了素祭”表示对这些虚假的敬拜。<br />你们这些离弃耶和华、忘记我的圣山、给迦得（即:外国人的神）摆桌子、给弥尼盛满调和酒的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.11.htm">65:11</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />儿子捡柴，父亲烧火，妇女抟面做饼，献给天后，又向别神浇奠祭。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.18.htm">7:18</a>）<br /><br />我们定要成就我们口中所出的一切话，向天后烧香，向她浇奠祭，按着我们与我们列祖、君王在犹大的城邑中和耶路撒冷的街市上素常所行的一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.17.htm">44:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“天后”表示一切虚假，因为“天上的众军”在正面意义上表示真理，在反面意义上表示虚假；因此“国王”和“王后”也是如此；因此“王后”表示一切（虚假），“向她浇奠祭”表示敬拜它们。<br /><br />迦勒底人必来焚烧这城和其中的房屋。在这房顶上，人曾向巴力烧香，向别神浇奠。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.29.htm">32:29</a>）<br />“迦勒底人”表示其敬拜涉及虚假的人；“焚烧这城”表示摧毁并荒废那些其教义教导虚假的人。“在这房顶上，人曾向巴力烧香”表示对邪恶的敬拜；“向别神浇奠”表示对虚假的敬拜。<br />何西阿书：<br />他们必不得住耶和华的地；以法莲却要归回埃及，他们必在亚述吃不洁净的食物；他们必不得向耶和华奠酒。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.3.htm">9:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“不得住耶和华的地”表示不居于爱之良善；“以法莲却要归回埃及”表示教会的理解力将变成事实和感官知识；“他们必在亚述吃不洁净的食物”表示出于推理的不洁和亵渎的欲望；“他们必不得向耶和华奠酒”表示没有基于真理的敬拜。<br />摩西五经：<br />他必说，他们的神，他们所投靠的磐石，就是向来吃他们祭牲的脂油，喝他们奠祭之酒的，在哪里呢？让他们兴起来帮助你们吧！（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.37.htm">32:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.38.htm">38</a>）<br />“神”和前面一样，表示虚假；“就是向来吃他们祭牲的脂油”表示他们摧毁敬拜的良善；“喝他们奠祭之酒的”表示他们摧毁敬拜的真理；经上还提到“浇奠的血”，诗篇：<br />追求别神的，他们的愁苦必加增；他们所浇奠的血我不献上；我嘴唇也不提他们的名。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗16.4.htm">16:4</a>）<br />这些“浇奠”表示对真理的亵渎，因为在这种情况下，“血”表示向仁所施的暴行（<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>节），以及亵渎（<a href="1003.htm">1003</a>节）。</p>

And he poured out a drink-offering thereon. That this signifies the Divine good of truth, is evident from the signification of a "drink-offering," as being the Divine good of truth, of which below; but 
first I will state what the good of truth is. The good of truth is that which has elsewhere been called the good of faith, and is love toward the neighbor, or charity. There are two universal kinds 
of good, one of which is called the good of faith, and the other the good of love. The good of faith is what is signified by a "drink-offering," and the good of love by "oil." They who are brought by 
the Lord to good by an internal way are in the good of love, but they who are brought by an external way are in the good of faith. The men of the celestial church, and likewise the angels of the inmost 
or third heaven, are in the good of love; but the men of the spiritual church, and likewise the angels of the middle or second heaven, are in the good of faith. For this reason the former good is called 
celestial good, but the latter spiritual good. The difference is the same as that between willing well from good will, and willing well from good understanding. The latter therefore, namely, spiritual 
good, or the good of faith, or the good of truth, is what is signified by a "drink-offering;" but the former, namely, celestial good, or the good of love, is what is understood in the internal 
sense by "oil." [2] That such things were signified by the "oil" and the "drink-offering" cannot indeed be seen except from the internal sense, and yet it must be apparent to everyone that holy things 
were represented, for otherwise what else would be the pouring out of a drink-offering and of oil upon a pillar of stone than a ridiculous and idolatrous performance? And so in the making of a king, 
unless holy things were signified and involved in the putting of a crown on his head, anointing him with oil from a horn upon his forehead and upon his wrists, putting a scepter into his hand besides 
a sword and keys, investing him with a crimson robe and then seating him upon a throne of silver; and afterwards in his riding on a horse in royal trappings and being served at table by those of highest 
rank, not to mention other formalities, unless all these ceremonies represented holy things, and were venerable through their correspondence with the things of heaven and thence of the church, they 
would be like babies' plays on a larger scale, or like plays on the stage.  [3] Nevertheless all these rituals derived their origin from the most ancient times, when rituals were holy from their representing 
holy things, and from correspondence with the holy things in heaven and thence in the church. Moreover, at the present day they are regarded as venerable, not because it is known what they 
represent, or to what they correspond, but by an interpretation as of emblems that are in use. But if it were known what each of these things represents, and to what holy thing it corresponds - the crown, 
the oil, the horn, the scepter, the sword, the keys, riding upon a white horse, and eating while nobles are serving-men would think of them with much more reverence. But this they do not know, and 
wonderful to say, do not desire to know, to such a degree have the representatives and significatives which are in such things and everywhere in the Word been at the present day destroyed in the minds 
of men. [4] That a "drink-offering" signifies the good of truth, or spiritual good, may be seen from the sacrifices in which it was employed. Sacrifices were made from the herd or from the flock, 
and were representative of the internal worship of the Lord (n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519). To these were added the meat-offering and the drink-offering. The meat-offering, which consisted 
of fine flour mingled with oil, signified celestial good, or what is the same, the good of love, "oil" signifying love to the Lord, and "fine flour" charity toward the neighbor. But the drink-offering, 
which consisted of wine, signified spiritual good, or what is the same, the good of faith. Both together therefore (namely, the meat-offering and the drink-offering) signified the same things 
as the bread and wine in the Holy Supper. [5] That these were added to the burnt-offerings and sacrifices is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt offer two lambs of the first year day by day continually; 
the one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer between the evenings; and a tenth of fine flour mingled with beaten oil, a fourth of a hin, and drink offering of 
the fourth of a hin of wine for the first lamb; and so also for the second lamb (Exod. 29:38-41).      In the day when ye wave the sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest, ye shall offer a lamb without 
blemish of the first year, for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, the meat-offering whereof shall be two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil, and the drink offering whereof shall be of wine, the fourth 
of a hin (Lev. 23:12, 13, 18).      On the day when the days of his Naziriteship are fulfilled, he shall offer his gift unto Jehovah (sacrifices), and a basket of unleavened things of fine flour, 
cakes mingled with oil, with unleavened wafers anointed with oil, with their meat-offering and their drink-offerings (Num. 6:13-15, 17).      Upon the burnt-offering they shall offer a meat-offering 
of a tenth of fine flour mingled with the fourth of a hin of oil; and wine for the drink offering, the fourth of a hin, in one manner for the burnt-offering of a ram, and in another manner for that of 
an ox (Num. 15:3-5, 11).      With the burnt-offering of the daily sacrifice thou shalt offer a drink-offering, the fourth of a hin for a lamb; in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering 
of wine unto Jehovah (Num. 28:6, 7). Moreover concerning the meat-offerings and drink-offerings in the sacrifices of various kinds, see Num. 28:7-31; 29:1-40. [6] That the meat-offering and the drink-offering 
had this signification may be seen from the fact that love and faith effect everything of worship; and it may be seen above that the bread (which here is of fine flour mingled with oil) and 
the wine in the Holy Supper signify love and faith, thus everything of worship (n. 1798, 2165, 2177, 2187, 2343, 2359, 3464, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217).  [7] But when the people fell away from the genuine 
representative of the worship of the Lord, and turned away to other gods and poured out drink-offerings to them, then by the drink-offerings were signified things which are opposite to charity and 
faith, namely, the evils and falsities of the love of the world, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ye did become heated with gods under every green tree, thou hast also poured out to them a drink-offering, thou 
hast offered a meat-offering (Isa. 57:5-6); </p>
<p>"to become heated with gods" denotes the concupiscences of falsity (that "gods" denote falsities, n. 4402, 4544); "under every green tree" denotes from the 
belief of all falsities (n. 2722, 4552); "to pour out to them a drink-offering and offer a meat-offering" denotes the worship of them. Again: </p>
<p>     Ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget the mountain of 
My holiness, that prepare a table for Gad, and fill a drink-offering to Meni (Isa. 65:11). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle a fire, and the women knead dough, to make 
cakes to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out a drink-offering to other gods (Jer. 7:18). [8] Again: </p>
<p>     Doing we will do every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the 
queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings to her as we and our fathers have done, and our princes in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem (Jer. 44:17-19); </p>
<p>"the queen of 
the heavens" denotes all falsities, for in the genuine sense the "armies of the heavens" are truths, but in the opposite sense falsities, and in like manner the "king and queen;" thus the "queen" denotes 
all of them, and "to pour drink-offerings to her" is to worship. [9] Again: </p>
<p>     The Chaldeans shall burn the city, and the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and have poured 
out drink-offerings to other gods (Jer. 32:29); </p>
<p>"the Chaldeans" denote those who are in worship in which there is falsity; "to burn the city" denotes to destroy and vastate those who are in doctrinal 
things of what is false; "to offer incense to Baal upon the roofs of the houses" denotes the worship of what is evil; "to pour out drink-offerings to other gods" denotes the worship of what is false. [10] 
In Hosea: </p>
<p>     They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land, and Ephraim shall return into Egypt, and they shall eat what is unclean in Assyria; they shall not pour out wine to Jehovah (Hos. 9:3, 
4); </p>
<p>"not to dwell in Jehovah's land" denotes not to be in the good of love; "Ephraim shall return into Egypt" denotes that the intellectual of the church will become mere knowledge and sensuous; "they 
shall eat what is unclean in Assyria" denotes impure and profane things from reasoning; "they shall not pour out wine to Jehovah" denotes no worship from truth. [11] In Moses:  It shall be said, 
Where are their gods, the rock in which they trusted, that did eat the fat of the sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them arise and help them (Deut. 33:37-38); </p>
<p>"gods," as above, 
denote falsities; "that did eat the fat of the sacrifices" denotes that they destroyed the good of worship; "that drank the wine of their drink-offering" denotes that they destroyed the truth of 
worship. Drink-offerings are also predicated of blood, in David: </p>
<p>     They shall multiply their griefs, they have hastened to another, lest I pour out their drink-offerings of blood, and lest I take 
up their names upon my lips (Ps. 16:4); </p>
<p>and by these words are signified the profanations of truth; for in this sense "blood" denotes violence offered to charity (n. 374, 1005), and profanation (n. 1003). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4581</b></p><p><b>4581.</b>
'And he poured out a drink-offering onto it' means the Divine Good of Truth This is clear from the meaning of 'a drink-offering' as the Divine Good of Truth, dealt with below. But first one must say 
what the good of truth is. The good of truth is that which elsewhere has been called the good of faith, which is love towards the neighbour, or charity. There are two universal kinds of good, the first 
being that which is called the good of faith, the second that which is referred to as the good of love. The good of faith is the kind of good meant by 'a drink-offering', and the good of love the kind 
meant by 'oil'. The good of love exists with those whom the Lord brings to what is good by an internal way, while the good of faith exists with those He brings to it by an external way. The good of 
love exists with members of the celestial Church, and likewise with angels of the inmost or third heaven, but the good of faith with members of the spiritual Church, and likewise with angels of the middle 
or second heaven. Consequently the first kind of good is called celestial good, whereas the second kind is called spiritual good. The difference between the two is, on the one hand, willing what 
is good out of a will for good and, on the other, willing what is good out of an understanding of it. The second kind of good therefore - spiritual good or the good of faith, which is the good of truth 
- is meant by 'a drink-offering'; but the first - celestial good or the good of love - is meant in the internal sense by 'oil'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nobody, it is true, can see that such things as these were meant 
by 'oil' and 'a drink-offering' unless he does so from the internal sense Yet anyone may see that things of a holy nature were represented by them, for unless those holy things were represented by 
them what else would pouring out a drink-offering or pouring oil onto a stone pillar be but some ridiculous and idolatrous action? It is like the coronation of a king. What else would the ceremonies performed 
on that occasion be if they did not mean and imply things of a holy nature - placing the crown on his head; anointing him with oil from a horn, on his forehead and on his wrists; placing a sceptre 
in his hand, as well as a sword and keys; investing him with a purple robe, and then seating him on a silver throne; and after that, his riding in his regalia on a horse, and later still his being 
served at table by men of distinction, besides many other ceremonies? Unless these represented things of a holy nature and were themselves holy by virtue of their correspondence with the things of 
heaven and consequently of the Church, they would be no more than the kind of games that young children play, though on a grander scale, or else like plays that are performed on the stage </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But all 
those ceremonies trace their origin back to most ancient times when ceremonies were holy by virtue of their representation of things that were holy and of their correspondence with holy things in heaven 
and consequently in the Church. Even today they are considered holy, though not because people know their spiritual representation and correspondence but through the interpretation so to speak they 
put on symbols in common use. If however people did know what the crown, oil, horn, sceptre, sword, keys, purple robe, silver throne, riding on a white horse, and eating while men of distinction act 
as the servers, all represented and to what holy thing each corresponded, they would conceive of those things in an even holier way. But they do not know, and surprisingly do not wish to know; indeed 
that lack of knowledge is so great that the representatives and the meaningful signs included within such ceremonies and within every part of the Word have been obliterated from people's minds at the 
present day. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that 'a drink-offering' means the good of truth, or spiritual good, may be seen from the sacrifices in which drink-offerings were used. When sacrifices were offered they 
were made either from the herd or from the flock, and they were representative of internal worship of the Lord, <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2805.htm">2805</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>. To these the minchah and the drink-offering 
were added. The minchah, which consisted of fine flour mixed with oil, meant celestial good, or what amounted to the same, the good of love - 'the oil' meaning love to the Lord and 'the fine flour' 
charity towards the neighbour. But the drink-offering, which consisted of wine, meant spiritual good, or what amounted to the same, the good of faith. Both these therefore, the minchah and the drink-offering, 
have the same meaning as the bread and wine in the Holy Supper. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The addition of a minchah and a drink-offering to a burnt offering or to a sacrifice is clear in Moses, </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The meaning that 'minchah and drink-offering' had may be seen in addition from the considerations that love and faith constitute the whole of worship, and that in the Holy Supper 'the 
bread' - described in the quotations above as fine flour mixed with oil - and 'the wine' mean love and faith, and so the whole of worship, dealt with in <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="2359.htm">2359</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>,

<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 But when people fell away from the genuine representative kind of worship of the Lord and turned to other gods and poured out drink-offerings to these, 'drink-offerings' came 
to mean things that were the reverse of charity and faith, namely the evils and falsities that go with the love of the world; as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
You inflamed yourselves among the gods under every green 
tree. You have also poured out a drink-offering to them, you have brought a minchah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Inflaming oneself among the gods' stands for cravings for falsity - 'gods' meaning falsities, 
<a href="4402.htm">4402</a> (end), <a href="4544.htm">4544</a>. 'Under every green tree' stands for the trust in all falsities which leads to those cravings, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="4552.htm">4552</a>. 'Pouring out a drink-offering to them' and 'bringing a minchah' stand for the 
worship of those falsities. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain, who set a table for Gad, and fill a drink-offering for Meni. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
sons gather pieces of wood, and the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%207:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 7:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
We will surely do every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we did, we and our fathers, and our princes 
in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2044:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 44:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The queen of heaven' stands for all falsities, for 'the hosts of heaven' in the genuine sense means truths, and in the contrary 
sense falsities, and so in the same way do 'king' and 'queen'. 'Queen' accordingly stands for all [falsities] and 'pouring out drink-offerings to her' means worshipping them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The Chaldeans will burn the city, and the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to Baal and poured out drink-offerings to other gods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2032:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 32:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Chaldeans' stands for people 
whose worship involves falsity. 'Burning the city' stands for destroying and laying waste those whose doctrines teach falsity. Upon the roofs of the houses burning; incense to Baal' stands for the 
worship of what is evil, 'pouring out drink-offerings to other gods' for the worship of what is false. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
They will not dwell in Jehovah's land, but Ephraim will return to Egypt, 
and in Assyria they will eat what is unclean. They will not pour libations of wine to Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Not dwelling in Jehovah's land' stands for not abiding in the good of love. 'Ephraim will 
return to Egypt' stands for the Church when its understanding will come to be no more than factual and sensory knowledge. 'In Assyria they will eat what is unclean' stands for impure and profane desires 
that are the product of reasoning. 'They will not pour libations of wine to Jehovah' stands for no worship based on truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
It will be said, Where are their gods, the rock in 
which they trusted, who ate the fat of the sacrifices, [who] drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help them! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Gods' stands for falsities, as above. 'Who ate 
the fat of the sacrifices' stands for their destruction of the good belonging to worship, '[who] drank the wine of their drink-offering' for their destruction of the truth belonging to it. A reference 
to 'drink-offerings of blood' also occurs in David, </p>
<blockquote>
They will multiply their pains; they have hastened to another, lest I pour out their drink-offerings of blood, and take up their names upon My 
lips. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2016:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 16:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>By these 'drink-offerings' are meant profanations of truth, for in this case 'blood' means violence done to charity, <a href="374.htm">374</a>, <a href="1005.htm">1005</a>, and profanation, <a href="1003.htm">1003</a>. </p>

</p><b>4581.</b>
`Et libavit super illam libamen': quod significet Divinum Bonum Veri, constat ex significatione `libaminis' quod sit Divinum Bonum Veri, de qua sequitur; primum enim dicendum quid bonum veri: </p>
<p>bonum 
veri est id quod bonum fidei alibi dictum fuit, estque amor erga proximum seu charitas: sunt duo genera universalia boni, unum quod dicitur bonum fidei, alterum quod vocatur bonum amoris.  Bonum fidei 
est quod significatur per `libamen', et bonum amoris quod per `oleum'; qui ad bonum perducuntur a Domino per vim internam, illi sunt in bono amoris, at qui per viam externam, illi sunt bono fidei; 
homines Ecclesiae caelestis, similiter angeli intimi seu tertii caeli in bono amoris sunt, sed homines Ecclesiae spiritualis, similiter angeli medii seu secundi caeli, in bono fidei sunt; inde 
est quod illud bonum dicatur bonum caeleste, hoc autem {1} bonum spirituale; differentia est quae inter velle bene ex velle bene ac inter velle bene ex intelligere bene; hoc itaque, nempe bonum 
spirituale seu bonum fidei, seu bonum veri, est quod {2} per `libamen' significatur, illud autem, nempe bonum caeleste, seu bonum amoris, est quod per `oleum' in sensu interno intelligitur: [2] quod 
talia per oleum et libamen significata sint, non quidem videri potest nisi ex sensu interno, sed usque ab unoquovis, quod sancta per illa repraesentata fuerint, nam nisi sancta (t)per illa repraesentata 
fuissent, quid libare libamen et fundere oleum super statuam lapidis foret aliud quam quoddam ludicrum idololatricum; similiter ac nisi sancta significarent (c)et involverent dum rex creatur, 
nempe coronam imponere capiti ejus, ungere illum oleo ex cornu super frontem et super poplites manuum, sceptrum in manum ejus dare, ac insuper gladium, et claves, purpureo amictu circumdare, et 
tunc sedere super solio argenteo, ac dein in regio ornatu equitare, et quoque ad mensam postea ab optimatibus ministrari, praeter plura; haec nisi repraesentarent sancta, et per correspondentiam cum 
illis quae sunt caeli et inde Ecclesiae, sancta essent, non forent nisi lusus quales infantum sed in majore forma, aut sicut lusus super theatris; [3] sed usque omnia illa ritualia traxerunt suam 
originem ab antiquissimis temporibus quando ritualia sancta fuerunt ex eo quod repraesentarent sancta, et corresponderent sanctis quae in caelo et inde in Ecclesia; hodie quoque sancta habentur, non 
ex eo quod sciant quid repraesentant aut quibus correspondent, sed per interpretationem sicut emblematum quae in usu; si autem scirent quid repraesentat et cui sancto correspondet corona, oleum, 
cornu, sceptrum, ensis, claves, [purpureus amictus, solium argenteum] equitatio super equo albo, comestio ministrantibus optimatibus, de illis multo sanctius cogitarent; sed hoc non sciunt, et (t)quod mirum, 
hoc non scire volunt, in tantum sunt repraesentativa et significativa quae in talibus et quae ubivis in Verbo, in mentibus hodie deleta.  [4] Quod `libamen' significet bonum veri seu bonum spirituale, 
constare potest a sacrificiis in quibus adhibebantur; </p>
<p>sacrificia fiebant vel ex armento vel ex grege, et erant repraesentativa {3} cultus interni Domini, n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180, (x)2805, 
2807, 2830, 3519; illis adjiciebantur minhah et libamen, `minhah' quae constabat ex similagine mixta oleo, significabat bonum caeleste, seu quod idem, bonum amoris, `oleum' amorem in Dominum 
et `similago' charitatem erga proximum; `libamen' autem, quod constabat ex vino, significabat bonum spirituale, seu quod idem, bonum fidei; utrumque itaque, nempe minhah et libamen, eadem quae panis 
et vinum in Sancta Cena.  [5] Quod illa adjicerentur holocaustis et sacrificiis, constat apud Mosen,           Facies {4} agnos duos filios anni in diem juge, agnum      unum facies mane, et agnum 
alterum facies inter vesperas, et      decima similaginis mixta oleo tuso, quadrante hinis, et      libamen quadrantis hinis vini agno primo; ita quoque agno      alteri, Exod. xxix 38-41: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem,           Facietis in die, quo motitatis manipulum primitiarum      messis, agnum integrum filium anni sui in holocaustum      Jehovae, cujus minhah duae decimae similaginis mixtae      
oleo,... et libamen ejus vinum, quarta hinis, Lev. xxiii 12,      13, 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           In die quo implentur dies naziraeatus,... offeret munus      suum Jehovae, sacrificia,... ut et calathum 
azymorum ex      similagine, placentas mixtas oleo, ac lagana azymorum uncta      oleo, cum minhah eorum, et libaminibus eorum, Num. vi 13-17: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Super holocaustum facient 
minham e similagine decimam      mixtam quarta hinis olei, vinum in libamen, quartam hinis: </p>
<p>     aliter super holocaustum ex ariete, et aliter ex bove, Num.      xv 3, 4, (x)5-11: </p>
<p>apud eundem,  
         Ad holocaustum jugis facies... libamen quarta hinis in      agnum; in sancto liba libamen vini Jehovae, Num. xxviii 6,  7; </p>
<p>porro de minhis et libaminibus in sacrificiis varii generis, Num. xxviii 
7, 6 ad fin.; xxix 1 ad fin.  [6] Quod `minhah et libamen' illa significaverint, constare etiam potest ex eo quod amor et fides faciant omne cultus; et quod `panis,' qui ibi similago mixta oleo, 
et `vinum,' significent amorem et fidem, ita omne cultus, in Sancta Cena, de qua n. 1798, 2165, 2177, 2187, 2343, 2359, 3464, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217.  [7] Cum autem recesserunt a genuino repraesentativo 
cultus Domini, et converterunt se ad deos alios, ac illis libaverunt libamina, tunc per `libamina' significabantur illa quae opposita sunt charitati et fidei, nempe mala amoris mundi, et falsa; 
ut apud Esaiam,           Incaluistis in diis sub omni arbore viridi,... etiam      illis effudisti libamen, obtulisti minham {5}, lvii 5, 6; </p>
<p>`incalescere in diis' pro concupiscentiis falsi; 
quod `dii' sint falsa, n. 4402 f., 4544; `sub omni arbore viridi' pro ex fide omnium falsorum, n. 2722, 4552; `effundere illis libamen et offerre minham' pro cultu illorum: apud eundem,       
    Vos qui desertis Jehovam, qui obliviscimini montis      sanctitatis Meae, qui disponitis Gadi {6} mensam, et      impletis Menio {7} libamen, lxv 11: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,           Filii colligunt ligna, 
et patres accendunt ignem, et      mulieres depsunt massam, ad faciendum placentas reginae      caelorum, et ad libandum libamina {8} diis aliis, vii 18: </p>
<p>[8] {9} apud eundem,           Faciendo 
faciemus omne verbum, quod exivit ex ore      nostro, suffiendo reginae caelorum, et libando ei libamina      quemadmodum fecimus nos et patres nostri,... et principes      nostri in urbibus Jehudae, 
et in plateis Hierosolymae, xliv      17-19; </p>
<p>`regina caelorum' pro omnibus falsis, `exercitus' enim `caelorum' in genuino sensu sunt vera, in opposito autem falsa, similiter rex et regina, 
ita `regina' pro omnibus, `ei libare libamina' est colere: </p>
<p>[9] apud eundem,           Chaldaei comburent urbem, et domos super quarum tectis      suffiverunt baali, et libaverunt libamina diis aliis, 
xxxii      29; </p>
<p>`Chaldaei' pro illis qui in cultu in quo falsum ; `comburere urbem' pro destruere et vastare illos qui in doctrinalibus falsi; `super domuum tectis suffire baali' pro cultu mali, 
{10} `libare libamina diis aliis' pro cultu falsi: </p>
<p>[10] apud Hosheam,           Non habitabunt in terra Jehovae, et revertetur Ephraim      in Aegyptum, et in Assyria immundum comedent, non libabunt  
    Jehovae vinum, ix 3, 4; </p>
<p>non habitare in terra Jehovae pro non esse in bono amoris; </p>
<p>`revertetur Ephraim in Aegyptum' pro quod intellectuale Ecclesiae  fiet {11} scientificum et sensuale; 
`in Assyria immundum comedent' pro impuris et profanis ex ratiocinatione; `non libabunt Jehovae vinum' pro nullo cultu ex vero: </p>
<p>[11] apud Mosen,           Dicetur, Ubi dii eorum, petra cui confisi 
sunt, qui      adipem sacrificiorum comederunt, biberunt vinum libaminis      eorum?  surgant et juvent eos, Deut. xxxii 37, 38; </p>
<p>`dii' pro falsis, ut supra; `qui adipem sacrificiorum comederunt' pro 
quod destruxerint bonum cultus, `biberunt vinum libaminis eorum' pro quod verum cultus.  Libamina etiam de sanguine praedicantur {12} apud Davidem,           Multiplicabunt dolores eorum, ad alium 
festinarunt, ne      libabo libamina eorum de sanguine, et ne tollam nomina      illorum super labia mea, Ps. xvi 4, et per illa significantur profanationes veri, `sanguis' enim in illo sensu 
est violentia illata charitati, n. 374, 1005, et profanatio, n. 1003.      @1 et hoc$      @2 hoc itaque est bonum veri, et$      @3 i in genere$      @4 Heb. [ ] (`asah) = `to make, to prepare (a
