<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1272.</strong>后来，我得知他们的女人是怎么打扮的。她们头戴一顶黑色圆帽，帽子前端翘起呈塔状，脸很小；而男人们则毛茸茸的。我还得知，他们以子女众多为荣，无论到哪里去，都有子女相随，他们的孩子沿曲线在前面领路。然而，他们被告知，即便是野兽，哪怕是最凶猛的那种，也会爱自己的孩子；这并不能证明他们有善心；不过，若他们对孩子的爱不是出于我欲和自己的荣耀，而是为了公众利益而扩充人类社会，尤其是为了主的国而使天堂能因此繁衍，那么，他们对子女的爱就是纯粹的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1272.</strong> After these things, I was shown how the women among them dressed. On their head they had a long, rounded, black hat with a peak in front.{*1} Their faces were small. The men, on the other hand, were shaggy with hair.<br />I was shown also how proud they were to have large numbers of children. Wherever they ventured, they took their children with them, letting the children walk in front in a curved line. But they were told that animals — even the worst ones — all love their offspring, and that this provides no proof of virtue in them. They could have loved their children not out of conceit or pride, it was said, but out of a desire to increase world population for the sake of the common good, and more especially to swell the number of people in heaven.{*2} So they could have made the Lord's kingdom their goal, and then they would have exhibited a genuine love for children.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg drew an illustration of this hat in his Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1272/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3589" target=_top>3589</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} This statement reflects a view, common at the time, that population increase was a good thing. Possibly there is an echo of the command of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1272/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_28" target=_top>Genesis 1:28</a>: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it" (New Revised Standard Version). Furthermore, Swedenborg often refers to the human race as the "breeding ground for heaven," that is, as the stock from which the inhabitants of heaven derive; compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1272/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6697" target=_top>6697:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1272/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7069" target=_top>7069</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1272/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9441" target=_top>9441</a>.

It was afterwards shown me how their women were dressed. They wore upon the head a round black hat, projecting turret-like in front, and had a small face, whereas the men were shaggy and hairy. It was 
shown me also how they gloried in the great number of their children; and that they had their children with them wherever they went, who walked before them in a curved line. But they were told that 
the brutes also, even the worst, all have a love for their young; and that this is no evidence that there is anything good in them; but that if they had loved children, not from their love of themselves 
and their own glory, but that human society might be augmented, for the common good; and especially if they had loved them in order that heaven might thereby be multiplied, thus for the sake of the 
Lord's kingdom, then their love for children would have been genuine. </p>

I was shown after that how their womenfolk were dressed. On their heads they wore a round black hat with a turret so to speak sticking up at the front. They had small faces. The men however were shaggy 
and hairy. I was also shown how much they gloried in the large number of children they had, and that wherever they went they were accompanied by their children who led the way in a curving line. They 
were told however that love of their young also existed with every animal, even the worst, and that this was no argument that they had anything good existing with them. But if they had loved children 
not for reasons of self-love and glory but so that, for the sake of the common good, the human community would be increased, and more importantly so that heaven might consequently be enlarged - and 
so for the sake of the Lord's kingdom - their love towards children would in that case have been genuine. </p>

</p><b>1272.</b>
Ostensum mihi postea quomodo mulieres eorum amictae fuerint:' circum caput habuerunt pileum rotundum nigrum; protensum, quasi turritum antrorsum, facie fuerunt parva; viri autem hirsuti et pilosi.  
Ostensum quoque quantum gloriati sunt de multitudine infantum, quod, ubicumque vaderent, haberent secum suos liberos qui praeibant in linea inflexa; sed iis dictum quod amor infantum quoque sit apud omnia 
bruta, etiam pessima, et quod hoc non argumentum sit quod aliquid bonum apud eos; at si liberos amavissent non sui amoris et gloriae causa, sed ut societas humana ob commune bonum augeretur, et magis 
ut caelum inde multiplicaretur, ita propter regnum Domini quod tunc fuisset amor erga infantes genuinus. </p>
