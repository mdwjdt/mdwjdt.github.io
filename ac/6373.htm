<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6373节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6373.</strong>“直等细罗来到”表主的到来和那时和平的安宁。这从“细罗”的含义清楚可知，“细罗”是指主，主被称为“细罗”是由于这一事实：祂给万物带来和平，使它们安宁；因为在原文，“细罗”源于一个表示安宁的词。主在此被称为“细罗”的原因，从刚才（<a href="6371.htm">6371</a>，<a href="6372.htm">6372</a>节）关于属天国度，以及它的权柄和掌控的阐述明显看出来。事实上，当神性通过属天国度呈现自己时，是不会有安宁的，因为天堂里的事物和地狱里的事物无法通过该国度被带入秩序。这是因为神性在流经属天国度时，无法保持纯净，因为天也不洁净（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯15.15.htm">15:15</a>）；因此，属天国度没有强大到万物能通过它被保持在秩序中的地步。更重要的是，结果那时，地狱和魔鬼灵从地狱上来，统治正从世界来到的灵魂；后果就是，除了属天人外，没有人能得救。最终若非主取得人身，并在自己里面将这人身变成神性，这些人几乎无法得救。<br />主通过如此行而将万物归入秩序，先将天堂里的事物，然后将地狱里的事物归入秩序；这便产生了和平的安宁。属灵人，即那些属于属灵教会的人通过主的到来得救（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）；主在世时，将万物归入秩序（参看<a href="1820.htm">1820</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4287.htm">4287</a>节）；神性真理从耶和华或主经由流入人类。但由于在人类远离良善的情况下，这还不足够，所以主降世，将自己里面的人身变成神性，好叫神性真理从祂的神性人身发出，由此拯救通过真理接受良善的人（参看<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>节）。</p>

Until Shiloh come. That this signifies the coming of the Lord, and the tranquillity of peace then, is evident from the signification of "Shiloh," as being the Lord, who is called "Shiloh" from the fact 
that He pacified and made all things tranquil; for in the original, "Shiloh" is derived from a word which means tranquillity. The reason why the Lord is here called "Shiloh" is plain from what was 
said above (n. 6371, 6372) about the celestial kingdom and its sovereignty; for when the Divine was presented to view through that kingdom there was in tranquillity, because the things in heaven, and 
the things in hell, could not thereby be reduced into order, for the Divine which flowed through that kingdom could not be pure, because heaven is not pure; thus neither was that kingdom so strong that 
all things could by means of it be kept in order; and therefore also the infernal and diabolical spirits were then raising themselves up from the hells and were ruling over the souls who were arriving 
from the world. The result was that none could be saved but the celestial; and at last scarcely they, unless the Lord had taken on the Human and had made this in Himself Divine; whereby the Lord reduced 
all things into order, first those in heaven, and afterward those in the hells; thus producing the tranquillity of peace. That the spiritual, that is, they who were of the spiritual church, were 
saved by the Lord's coming, may be seen above, n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834; and that the Lord, when in the world, reduced all things into order, n. 1820, 4286, 4287; that the Divine truth from Jehovah 
or the Lord flowed in through heaven into the human race, but because this did not suffice when man removed himself from good, the Lord came into the world and made the Human in Himself Divine, in order 
that from the very Divine Human of the Lord the Divine truth might proceed, and thus might save man, who should receive good through truth, may also be seen above, n. 4180, 6280. </p>

'Until Shiloh comes' means the Lord's Coming, and the peaceful tranquillity at that time. This is clear from the meaning of 'Shiloh' as the Lord, who is called Shiloh because He brought peace to all 
things and gave them tranquillity; for in the original language Shiloh is derived from a word meaning tranquil. Why the Lord is called Shiloh here is evident from what has been stated immediately above 
in <a href="6371.htm">6371</a>, <a href="6372.htm">6372</a>, regarding the celestial kingdom and its power and control. For when the Divine presented Himself by means of that kingdom there was no tranquillity, since things in heaven and those in 
hell could not be brought by means of that kingdom into a state of order. This was because the Divine, as it passed through that kingdom, could not remain pure since heaven is not pure;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so neither 
was that kingdom strong enough to serve as the means by which all things could be preserved in a state of order. And what is more, as a consequence hellish and devilish spirits were at that time breaking 
out of hell and having dominion over souls who were coming from the world, as a result of which a situation was coming about in which none but the celestial ones could be saved. At length scarcely 
these could have been saved if the Lord had not taken on the Human and made that Human within Himself Divine. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 By doing this the Lord brought all things into a state of order, first those in heaven, 
then those in hell; and this gave rise to peaceful tranquillity. </p>
<p>Spiritual people, that is, those who belonged to the spiritual Church, were saved through the Lord's Coming, see <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>. </p>
<p>When He was in the world the Lord brought all things into a state of order, <a href="1810.htm">1810</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4187.htm">4187</a>. </p>
<p>Divine Truth from Jehovah or the Lord flowed through heaven to the human race. But because this 
was insufficient when mankind departed from good, the Lord came into the world and made the Human within Himself Divine, so that the Lord's Divine Human would then be the source from which Divine 
Truth went forth and thereby saved a person who received good by means of truth, <a href="4180.htm">4180</a>, <a href="6280.htm">6280</a>.

`Usque dum venit Shiloh':  quod significet Adventum Domini, et tunc tranquillum pacis, constat ex significatione `Shiloh' n. 6375 quod sit Dominus, Qui Shiloh vocatur ex eo quod pacaverit et tranquilla 
reddiderit omnia; in lingua enim originali derivatur Shiloh a voce quae significat tranquillum; cur Dominus hic Shiloh dicitur, patet ab illis quae mox supra n. 6371, 6372, de regno caelesti et ejus 
potestate dicta sunt; cum enim {1} Divinum per illud regnum {2}sistebatur, tunc erat intranquillum, non enim potuerunt illa quae in caelo, et illa quae in inferno, per id in ordinem redigi; nam Divinum 
quod per illud regnum transfluebat, non potuit esse purum, quia caelum non est purum, ita id regnum nec validum ut per id omnia in ordine tenerentur; quapropter etiam tunc spiritus infernales et 
diabolici ab infernis se efferebant, et super animabus quae e mundo veniebant, dominabantur; [2]ex quo fiebat quod non alii tunc salvari potuerint quam caelestes; et tandem vix illi, nisi Dominus susceperit 
Humanum, et per quod illud in Se Divinum fecerit; per hoc Dominus omnia {3}redegit in ordinem, primum ea quae in caelo, dein illa quae in infernis; inde tranquillum pacis; quod spirituales, hoc 
est, illi qui a spirituali Ecclesia essent, salvati fuerint per Adventum Domini, videatur n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834; et quod Dominus cum in mundo fuit, redegerit omnia in ordinem, n. 1820, 4286, 4287; 
quod Divinum Verum a Jehovah seu Domino influxerit per caelum in humanum genus, sed quia hoc non suffecit cum homo se removit a bono, Dominus in mundum venit et Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, ut ab ipso 
Divino Humano Domini Divinum Verum procederet, et sic salvaret hominem qui reciperet bonum per verum, n. 4180, 6280. @1 omne Verum$ @2 sisteretur$ @3 redegerit$ </p>
