<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第715节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>715.</strong>上古之人知道，并谦卑地承认，他们无非是牲畜和野兽，唯独主使他们成为人，故他们将属于自己的一切不但比作牲畜和飞鸟，而且还如此称呼。他们将意愿之物比作并称为牲畜，将觉知之物比作并称为飞鸟。但他们区分善情与恶情。他们将善情比作羔羊、绵羊、小山羊、母山羊、公山羊、公绵羊、小母牛、公牛。它们都是良善和温和的，有益于人的生命，因为它们可用来吃，皮、毛能制成衣服。这些是主要的洁净牲畜，而邪恶、凶猛，无益于生命的，是不洁净的牲畜。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]715.</strong> The earliest people were aware that they were nothing more than animals and beasts and that if they were human it was only because the Lord made them so; and when feeling humble about themselves they confessed as much. So any attribute existing in themselves they not only compared to beasts and birds but also called such. Attributes of the will they compared to and referred to as animals. Attributes of the intellect they compared to and referred to as birds.<br />They made a distinction, though, between good and wicked feelings. The good ones they likened to lambs, ewes, kids, she-goats, bucks of the goats, rams, young cattle, and adult cattle. This was because these are good, gentle beasts, and useful in our lives, whether for eating or for the use of their hides and wool in our clothing. These in the main are the clean animals.<br />But those that are bad and savage and that are not useful in our lives are the unclean animals.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On bad and savage animals, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_715/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a> above.

As the most ancient people knew, and when they were in self-humiliation acknowledged, that they were nothing but beasts and wild beasts, and were men solely by virtue of what they had from the Lord, 
therefore whatever pertained to themselves they not only likened to but called beasts and birds; things of the will they compared to beasts, and called beasts; and things of the understanding they compared 
to and called birds. But they distinguished between good affections and evil affections. Good affections they compared to lambs, sheep, kids, she-goats, he-goats, rams, heifers, oxen-for the reason 
that they were good and gentle, and serviceable to life, since they could be eaten, and their skins and wool could furnish clothing. These are the principal clean beasts. But those which are evil 
and fierce, and not serviceable to life, are unclean beasts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 715</b></p><p><b>715.</b>
Since the most ancient people knew and when in self-abasement acknowledged that they were nothing but beasts and wild animals, and that the Lord alone enabled them to be human beings, they not only used 
to liken whatever resided with themselves to beasts and birds but also called them such. Things of the will they compared to beasts and called them beasts, and those of the understanding they compared 
to birds and called them birds. They differentiated however between good affections and evil affections. Good affections they compared to lambs, sheep, kids, he-goats, young she-goats, rams, young 
bulls, and oxen, because they were good and gentle creatures, and also because they had a use in life in that they could be eaten and men could clothe themselves with their skins and wool. These are 
chiefly the clean beasts. But the evil and savage ones, which also have no use in life, are unclean beasts. </p>

</p><b>715.</b>
Quia antiquissimi noverunt et, cum in humiliatione sui essent, agnoverunt quod non essent nisi quam bestiae et ferae, at quod homines essent, hoc solum haberent a Domino, ideo quicquid apud eos erat, 
non solum assimilabant bestiis et avibus, sed etiam ita vocabant; quae voluntatis erant, comparabant bestiis et vocabant bestias; et quae intellectus comparabant avibus et vocabant aves; sed distinguebant 
inter affectiones bonas et affectiones malas; affectiones bonas comparabant agnis, ovibus, haedis, capris, hircis caprarum, arietibus, juvencis, bovibus, ob causam quia bonae et mites, tum quia 
utiles vitae, ut quod comedi possent, et quod pellibus et lanis eorum vestiri; hae sunt principaliter bestiae mundae: at quae malae et immites, ut et inutiles vitae, sunt bestiae immundae. </p>
