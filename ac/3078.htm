<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3078节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3078.</strong>“利百加是彼土利所生的，彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子”表该情感的整个起源。这从“彼土利”、“密迦和拿鹤”，以及“亚伯拉罕”的代表清楚可知。至于这些人物各自具体代表什么，则无法解释和阐述明白。原因在于，对真理的初始情感固然源于主在属世人里面所获得的神圣事物（<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>节），但属世人中尚有一时半会无法被分离出去的母体成分，情感也出自这些母体成分。就其起源而言，该情感的性质在内义上以“利百加是彼土利所生的，彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子”这句话来描述。<br />每一情感尽管看似简单，如同一个单一实体，然而，它里面包含的事物如此数不胜数，以至于无法以任何概念来理解，更不用说加以描述了。因为每一情感里面都有人从婴幼儿直到那情感在他里面活跃之时的生命时光中所获得的整个生命。甚至除此之外还有其它事物，也就是那些生来遗传自父母、祖父母、曾祖父母之物。事实上，那情感构成诸如他所是的整个人。在来世，通过情感的显现，人有时能看到那人受我欲或物欲驱使的程度，并能看到他热爱诸如目的和意图那类的信条的程度；还能看到他热爱良善与真理的程度，这良善与真理的性质，以及如何被排列，也就是说，是结合、靠近还是分离及其程度，因而看到这类良善与真理与天上的秩序一致或不一致的程度。就像刚才说的，所有这些事物都能通过情感的显现被看到，因为情感构成整个人。这一事实对世人来说难以置信，但却是千真万确的。</p>

Who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother. That this signifies all the origin of this affection, is evident from the representation of Bethuel, and also of Milcah, 
and of Nahor, and of Abraham. What each represents specifically cannot be set forth and presented to the apprehension, for the reason that the first affection of truth did indeed derive its origin 
from the Divine things acquired by the Lord in the natural man (n. 3019), but still things from the mother were there, which could not be separated in a moment, and the affection was from them also. The 
quality of this affection in its origin is described in the internal sense by the words, "born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother." [2] Every affection, although it 
appears simple and as one thing, nevertheless contains within it things so innumerable that it cannot be comprehended by any idea, still less be described; for in every affection there is the man's whole 
life that has been acquired from his infancy even to the time of life when he is in the affection; nay, there are other things besides, namely, those which he has inherited from father and mother, 
grandparents and great-grandparents; for the affection is the whole man such as he is. In the other life, by a manifestation of the affection there is sometimes presented to view how much there is in 
anyone of the love of self, and how much of the love of the world; and how much of the love of principles, and for what end and use; also how much of the love of good and truth, and what is the quality 
of that good and truth, and also how the good and truth are disposed, that is, how far conjoined, approximating, or separate; thus how much they agree or disagree with heavenly order. As just stated, 
all these things are presented to view by a manifestation of the affection, because the affection is the whole man. That such is the case appears incredible to man, and yet it is true. </p>

'Who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milkah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother' means the whole origin of that affection. This is clear from the representation of 'Bethuel', and also of 'Milkah and 
Nahor', as well as of 'Abraham'. What the specific representation is of each of these cannot be explained and presented intelligibly, the reason being that the initial affection for truth had its origin 
indeed in the Divine things acquired by the Lord within the natural man, <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, but maternal elements were nevertheless there which could not be separated in an instant and from which also affection 
came. The nature of that affection in its origin is described in the internal sense by the details given here, that she was 'born to Bethuel, the son of Milkah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Although it appears to be simple and a single entity, every affection nevertheless contains details within itself which are so countless that it cannot even be apprehended, let alone described 
by any idea. For present within every affection there is a person's whole life which he has acquired from his earliest childhood through to the time of life when that affection is active in him. Indeed 
even more is present there, namely that which at birth he derived by heredity from father and mother, grandparents, and great grandparents. In fact that affection constitutes the whole person such 
as he is. In the next life through a revelation of a person's affection one is sometimes enabled to see how far that person is moved by self-love, and how far by love of the world; to see how far he 
is moved by a love of the things of first importance such as the end in view and the purpose; also how far he is moved by a love of good and truth, and to see the nature of that good and truth; and to 
see as well how these are ordered, that is to say, whether joined together, close together, or separated; thus to see how far such good and truth do not accord with heavenly order or how far they do 
accord. All of these things are able to be seen, as has been stated, through the revelation of the affection because affection constitutes the whole person. The truth of this seems unbelievable to man, 
but it is still the truth. </p>

`(x)Quae nata Bethueli filio Milkae uxoris Nahoris fratris Abrahami': quod significet omnem originem illius affectionis, constat ex repraesentatione `Bethuelis,' tum `Milkae et Nahoris,' ut et `Abrahami'; 
quid unusquisque in specie repraesentat, non ad captum exponi et sisti potest, ex causa quia prima affectio veri originem quidem duxit ex Divinis acquisitis a Domino in naturali homine, n. 3019, 
sed usque ibi materna fuerunt, quae non momento separari potuerunt, ex quibus etiam affectio; qualitas illius affectionis in origine sua in sensu interno describitur per haec, quod `nata Bethueli filio 
Milkae uxoris Nahoris fratris Abrahami.'  [2] Omnis {1}affectio, tametsi simplex et sicut unum apparet, usque in se tam innumerabilia continet, ut nusquam aliqua idea capi, minus describi possit; 
in unaquavis enim affectione est tota vita hominis, quae ab infantia ejus usque ad tempus aetatis in qua est cum in affectione, acquisita est, immo adhuc plura quae nempe hereditario a patre et matre, 
aque avis et atavis, per nativitatem traxit; affectio enim est totus homo qualis est; in altera vita per manifestationem affectionis sistitur quandoque videndum, quantum alicui inest ab amore sui, et 
quantum ab amore mundi, quantum ab amore principiorum, {2}qualis finis et usus; tum quantum ab amore boni et veri, et quale illud bonum et verum [est,] ut et quomodo illa disposita sunt, nempe conjuncta, 
approximantia, et separata, ita quantum ab ordine caelesti discordant, aut quantum cum illo concordant; haec omnia per manifestationem affectionis, ut dictum, quia affectio est totus homo; quod hoc 
ita sit, incredibile apparet homini, sed usque est verum. @1 i enim$ @2 propter quem finem, ad quem usum$ </p>
