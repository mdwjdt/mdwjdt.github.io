<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2190节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2190.</strong>“他说，看哪，在帐棚里”表它存在于圣洁中。这从“帐棚”的含义清楚可知，“帐棚”是指圣洁，如前面所解释的（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="1566.htm">1566</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>节）。之所以说理性真理存在于圣洁中，是因为它存在于良善中。一切良善都被视为圣洁，因为它是完全源于主的爱与仁的属性。不过，良善的形式如何，圣洁的形式就如何。良善通过信之真理形成，即生出并发展。故其性质取决于被植入在仁爱中的信之真理的质和量，如刚才所说的（<a href="2189.htm">2189</a>节）。由此清楚可知，良善或圣洁的形式因人而异。虽然它们的外在形式看似一样，但其内在形式却不同。这既适用于教会外的人，也适用于教会中人。人所具有的仁之善里面的事物之多，远远超出人的想象。其信的一切事物都在它里面，所以，它们就在其敬拜的圣洁中。天使如同在大白天一样清楚看见其敬拜之圣洁的性质，即使此人除了他处于某种程度的圣洁外，什么也不知道。其有关信之善与真并源于此的情感的无数思维就存在于其状态的圣洁中。不过，关于敬拜之圣洁的一般性质，蒙主怜悯，我将在别处说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2190</b></p><p><b>2190.</b>
And he said, Behold, in the tent. That this signifies that it was in what is holy, is evident from the signification of a "tent," as being what is holy (explained n. 414, 1102, 1566, 2145). It is said 
in what is holy, because it was in good. All good is called holy from the fact that it is of love and charity, which are solely from the Lord. But such as are the goods, such are the holinesses. Goods 
are formed, that is, are born and grow up, by means of the truths of faith, and their quality and quantity are therefore determined by those of the truth of faith implanted in charity (as just said, 
n. 2189), from which it follows that goods or the holinesses differ with everyone; and although in the external form they may appear to be alike, yet in the internal forms they are unlike; and this 
both with those who are out of the church and with those who are within the church. There are more things in the good of charity with a man than man can possibly believe. All the things of his faith are 
in it, and consequently they are in the holiness of his worship. The quality of the holiness of his worship appears to the angels as in clear day, although the man knows nothing beyond the fact that 
he is in a certain holy state. Myriads of myriads of his thoughts concerning the goods and truths of faith and of the derivative affections, are in the holiness of his state. But as to the holiness 
of worship, what it is in general, of the Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2190</b></p><p><b>2190.</b>
'And he said, Behold, in the tent' means that it existed within holiness. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tent' as holiness, dealt with in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="1566.htm">1566</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>. Rational truth is said to have existed 
within holiness because it existed within good. All good is called holy because it is an attribute of love and charity, which are derived wholly from the Lord. But as are forms of good, so are 
forms of holiness. Goods are formed, that is, they are born and develop, through the truths of faith. The nature of them therefore depends on the nature and the amount of the truth of faith that has been 
implanted in charity, as stated immediately above in <a href="2189.htm">2189</a>. From this it becomes clear that forms of good or holiness differ with each individual. Although they seem to be alike in the outward form 
they take they are not alike in their inward forms. And this applies both to people who are outside the Church and to those inside it. Within the good of charity residing with a person more is present 
than man can possibly believe. Present within it are all things that constitute his faith, and consequently they are present in the holiness of his worship. The nature of the holiness of his worship 
is visible to the angels as if seen in broad daylight, even though that person knows nothing further than that some degree of holiness exists with him. Myriads upon myriads of his thoughts concerning 
the goods and truths of faith and of the affections deriving from these are present within the holiness existing within him. But the general character of the holiness of worship will in the Lord's Divine 
mercy be spoken of elsewhere. </p>

</p><b>2190.</b>
Quod `dixit, Ecce in tentorio' significet quod in sancto. constat a significatione `tentorii' quod sit sanctum, de qua n. 414: 1102, 1566, 2145; `in sancto' dicitur quia in bono; omne bonum vocatur 
sanctum, ex eo quod sit amoris et charitatis, quae unice a Domino; sed sicut sunt bona, ita sunt sancta; bona formantur, hoc est; nascuntur et adolescunt per vera fidei, seque habent ideo secundum qualitatem 
et quantitatem veri fidei implantati in charitate, ut mox supra n. 2189 dictum; inde constare potest quod bona seu sancta differant apud unumquemvis; et tametsi apparent in externa forma sicut 
similia, usque in internis formis sunt dissimilia; et hoc tam apud illos qui `sunt extra Ecclesiam' quam qui intra Ecclesiam: in bono charitatis apud hominem plura insunt quam usquam homo credere potest; 
insunt omnia fidei ejus, proinde in sancto cultus ejus; sanctum cultus ejus angelis apparet sicut in clara die quale est, tametsi homo nihil sciat praeter quod in quodam sancto sit; myriades myriadum 
cogitationum ejus de bonis et veris fidei, et affectionum inde, sunt in sancto ejus: sed de sancto cultus quale sit in genere, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi. </p>
