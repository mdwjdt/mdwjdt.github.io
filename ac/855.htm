<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第855节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>855.</strong>综上所述，清楚可知本节内容所表示的内义，即：属灵之人凭新的觉知之光而成为神圣的安息，这光是从仁爱放射出来的。天使以如此奇妙的多样性和如此令人快乐的次序感知这些真理，以致世人若仅仅获得一个这样的观念，成千上万的事物就会以多个系列进入并振奋他的情感，事实上，这类事物无法描述。内义贯穿始终的主的圣言就是这样，即便它在字义上看似粗略的历史，如此处经上说“七月十七日，方舟停在亚拉腊山上。”</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]855.</strong> These explanations show what the elements of the current verse mean on an inner plane: the spiritual person embodies a holy restfulness that results from the new glimmer of understanding radiated by charity. The angels perceive these details in all their amazing variety, arranged in a delightful pattern. If we could possess ourselves of just one idea like theirs, thousands and thousands of other insights along manifold lines would enter into it and touch our hearts. Those thoughts are completely beyond description. Such is the Lord's Word throughout its inner meaning, even though it looks like an unpolished history in its literal meaning — as does the current verse (despite the symbolism given): The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 855</b></p><p><b>855.</b>
From these things it is now evident what this verse in the internal sense signifies, namely, that the spiritual man is a holy "rest" by virtue of a new intellectual light that is derived from charity. 
These truths are perceived by angels in a variety so wonderful, and in an order so delightful, that could man but obtain a single such idea, there would be thousands and thousands of things in a manifold 
series that would enter and affect him, and in fact such things as could not possibly be described. Such is the Word of the Lord in its internal sense throughout, even when it appears in the letter 
to be crude history, as when it is here said that "the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 855</b></p><p><b>855.</b>
From these considerations it now becomes clear what the contents of this verse mean in the internal sense, namely, that a spiritual man is the holy rest which results from new light in the understanding, 
a light which shines from charity. These matters are perceived by angels with such remarkable variety, and in a sequence so delightful, that if merely one such idea existed with man thousands upon 
thousands in mounting series would enter in and stir his affection, and such indeed as would defy description. Such is the Word of the Lord throughout the internal sense, even when the sense of the 
letter looks like crude history, which is the case with the meaning of the statement that the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.  </p>

</p><b>855.</b>
Ex his nunc constare potest quid haec quae in hoc versu, in sensu interno significant, nempe, quod homo spiritualis sit quies sancta, ex novo lumine intellectuali quod charitatis; haec cum mirabili 
varietate et in jucundo ordine ita percipiuntur ab angelis ut si homo potuisset solum in una tali idea esse, millia et millia in multiplici serie forent, quae intrarent et afficerent, et quidem talia 
quae nusquam potuissent describi: tale est Verbum Domini ubivis in sensu interno, tametsi appareat in sensu litterae ut rude historicum, sicut haec quae illa significent, quod 'quievit arca in mense septimo, 
{1}in septimo decimo die mensis, super montibus Ararat.' 	@1 I has et, but cap., 850 and Heb. have in.$ </p>
