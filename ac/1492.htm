<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1492.</strong>“说，你向我作的是什么”表这回忆令祂悲伤。这也从说这话时的愤慨清楚可知：所导致的悲伤本身就是这样来表达的。内义的性质是：情绪本身就隐含在构成内义的这些话里面；不要关注字面上的这些话，就当它们不存在。这些话所隐含的情绪仿佛是知识的愤慨和主的悲伤，事实上，是因觉悟到祂怀着欢乐和愉快所吸收的记忆知识就这样被摧毁而产生的悲伤。这和小孩子的情形是一样的，当小孩子所爱的某样东西被父母拿走（因父母发现这东西对他们有害）时，他们就会由此感到悲伤。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1492.</strong> The fact that he said, "What is this you have done to me?" means that it caused him anguish can be seen from the outrage itself with which the words are said. The anguish, then, is explicitly voiced in these words. The inner meaning is such that the actual emotion implicit in the words is what makes up the inner meaning. The literal words themselves are not noticed; it is as if they did not exist. The feeling present in the words is anger on the part of secular knowledge, so to speak, and grief on the part of the Lord 钬?grief to know that the facts he had learned with such satisfaction and pleasure would be destroyed in this way. His predicament resembled that of babies who love something that their parents can see is dangerous for them; removing the object makes the baby cry. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1492</b></p><p><b>1492.</b>
And said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? That this signifies that it grieved Him, is also evident from the very indignation in which this is said: the grief itself is thus expressed. The internal 
sense is such that the affection itself that lies hidden in the words is what constitutes it; the words of the letter are not attended to, but are as if they had no existence. The affection in 
these words is the indignation as it were of the memory-knowledge, and the Lord's grief; and in fact grief from this, that the memory-knowledges which He had learned with pleasure and delight should 
be thus destroyed. The case herein is like that of little children who when they love something their parents see to be hurtful to them, and it is taken away from them, are thereby grieved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1492</b></p><p><b>1492.</b>
That 'he said, What is this you have done to me?' means that it grieved Him becomes clear-also from the very indignant way in which these things were said. The resulting grief itself is thus expressed. 
The internal sense is such that it is the emotion itself lying hidden within the words which constitutes the internal sense. No attention is paid to the words of the letter; it is as though these did 
not exist. The emotion held within the words used here is so to speak knowledge's indignation and the Lord's grief, and is indeed grief arising from the realization that the facts which He had absorbed 
with pleasure and delight were to be thus destroyed. It is the same with little children who, when something they love is taken away from them which their parents see is harmful to them, grieve over 
their loss of it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1492</b>
</p><b>1492.</b>
Quod 'dixit, quid hoc fecisti mihi' significet quod Ipsi doluit, constare quoque potest ex ipsa indignatione in qua haec dicta; ipsa indolentia inde ita exprimitur; sensus internus talis est ut ipsa 
affectio quae latet in verbis, sit, quae internum sensum constituit; ad verba litterae non attenditur, sunt illa sicut nulla forent; affectio quae in his verbis, est indignatio quasi scientiae, et indolentia 
Domini, et quidem indolentia inde quod destruerentur ita scientifica quae cum oblectamento et deliciis hausit; se habet hoc, sicut dum infantes aliquid amant quod parentes vident illis noxium, 
cum illis aufertur, quod id illis dolori sit.
