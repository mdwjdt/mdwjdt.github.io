<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5150节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5150.</strong>“约瑟回答说”表从凭属世层里面的属天层所获得的觉知而来的启示。这从“回答说”的含义和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“回答说”是指出于觉知的启示，如前所述（<a href="5121.htm">5121</a>节）；“约瑟”是指属世层里面的属天层（<a href="5086.htm">5086</a>，<a href="5087.htm">5087</a>，<a href="5106.htm">5106</a>节）。“约瑟”在此之所以表示属世层里面的属天层，是因为此处所论述的主题是属世层。至于属天层和属灵层，情况是这样：从主的神性流入天堂的属天层本身和属灵层本身主要居于内层理性层；因为那里的形式更完美，适合去接受。尽管如此，属天层和属灵层也从主的神性流入外层理性层，同样流入属世层，并且既间接流入，也直接流入。它们经由内层理性层间接流入，直接从主的神性本身流入。直接流入的，是带来次序的；间接流入的，是被带入次序的。这就是发生在外层理性层，以及属世层中的情形。由此明显可知属世层里面的属天层是什么意思。<br />属天层源于神性良善，属灵层源于神性真理，二者皆源于主。当它们存在于理性层中时，就被称为理性层里面的属天层和属灵层；当它们存在于属世层中时，就被称为属世层里面的属天层和属灵层。“理性层”和“属世层”就表示这个人自己，只要他已被形成以接受属天层和属灵层。但“理性层”是指他的内在，“属世层”是指他的外在。人凭流入他的事物和对它的接受而被称为属天人或属灵人：若在其心智的意愿部分接受主的神性良善，就是属天人；若在理解力部分接受主的神性良善，就是属灵人。</p>

And Joseph answered and said. That this signifies revelation from perception, from the celestial in the natural, is evident from the signification of "answering and saying," as being revelation from 
perception (of which above, see n. 5121); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial in the natural (n. 5086, 5087, 5106). That here "Joseph" is the celestial in the natural, is because 
the subject here treated of is the natural. In regard to the celestial and the spiritual the case is this. The celestial itself and the spiritual itself which flow into heaven from the Divine of 
the Lord dwell principally in the interior rational; for there the forms are more perfect, and are accommodated to reception; nevertheless the celestial and spiritual from the Divine of the Lord flow 
into the exterior rational also, and likewise into the natural; and this both mediately and immediately-mediately through the interior rational, and immediately from the Lord's very Divine. That which 
flows in immediately disposes, and that which flows in mediately is disposed. This is the case in the exterior rational, and in the natural; and hence it is evident what is meant by the celestial in 
the natural. [2] The celestial is from the Divine good, and the spiritual is from the Divine truth, both of them being from the Lord; and when these are in the rational they are called the celestial 
and the spiritual in the rational; and when in the natural, the celestial and the spiritual in the natural. By the "rational" and the "natural" is meant the man himself, insofar as he is formed to receive 
the celestial and the spiritual; but by the "rational" is meant his internal, and by the "natural" his external. Through influx and according to the reception, a man is called celestial or spiritual-celestial 
if the Lord's Divine good is received in the will part, spiritual if it in received in the intellectual part. </p>

'And Joseph answered and said' means revelation resulting from perception received by the celestial within the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'answering and saying' as revelation resulting 
from perception, dealt with above in <a href="5121.htm">5121</a>; and from the representation of 'Joseph' as the celestial within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5086.htm">5086</a>, <a href="5087.htm">5087</a>, <a href="5106.htm">5106</a>. The reason 'Joseph' here means the celestial within 
the natural is that the natural is the subject. With regard to the celestial and the spiritual, the celestial itself and the spiritual itself which flow into heaven from the Lord's Divine reside 
principally in the interior rational, for the forms there are more perfect ones and apt receivers. Even so, the celestial and the spiritual also flow from the Lord's Divine into the exterior rational, 
and into the natural too, doing so both indirectly and directly. They flow indirectly by way of the interior rational, and directly from the Lord's Divine itself. What flows in directly is that which 
brings order, and what flows in indirectly is that to which order is brought. This is what happens in the exterior rational, as also in the natural. From this one may recognize what the celestial within 
the natural is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The celestial has its origin in Divine Good and the spiritual in Divine Truth - both having their origin in the Lord. When they exist in the rational they are called the celestial 
and spiritual within the rational, and when they exist in the natural they are called the celestial and spiritual within the natural. The rational and natural are used to mean the person himself 
insofar as he has been formed to receive the celestial and spiritual; but the rational is used to mean his internal and the natural his external. By reason of what flows into him, and depending on 
his reception of it, a person is called a celestial man or else a spiritual man - a celestial man if the Lord's Divine Good is received in the will part of his mind, a spiritual man if it is received 
in the understanding part. </p>

`Et respondit Joseph et dixit' quod significet revelationem a perceptione a caelesti in naturali, constat ex significatione `respondere et dicere' quod sit revelatio ex perceptione, de qua supra 
n. 5121 et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste in naturali, de qua n. 5086, 5087, 5106; quod `Josephus' hic sit caeleste in naturali, est quia de naturali agitur.  Cum caelesti et spirituali 
ita se habet: ipsum caeleste et ipsum spirituale quod in caelum a Divino Domini influit habitat principaliter in interiore rationali, ibi enim formae perfectiores sunt et ad receptionem accommodatae; 
at usque caeleste et spirituale a Divino Domini influit etiam in exterius rationale et quoque In naturale, et hoc tam mediate quam immediate, mediate per interius rationale, et immediate ab 
ipso Divino Domini; quod immediate influit, hoc disponit, et quod mediate influit, hoc disponitur; ita in exteriore rationali, ac ita in naturali; inde constare potest quid sit caeleste in naturali: 
caeleste est a Divino Bono et spirituale est a Divino Vero, utrumque a Domino, quae cum in rationali sunt, dicuntur caeleste et spirituale in rationali, et cum in naturali, dicuntur caeleste et 
spirituale in naturali.  [2] Per rationale et naturale intelligitur ipse homo quatenus formatus ad recipiendum caeleste et spirituale, sed per rationale intelligitur internum ejus, et per naturale 
externum; per influxum et secundum receptionem vocatur homo {1} caelestis aut spiritualis, caelestis si Divinum Domini Bonum recipitur in parte voluntaria, spiritualis si in parte intellectuali. </p>
