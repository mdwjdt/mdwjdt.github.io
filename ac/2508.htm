<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2508节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2508.</strong>“她是我的妹子”表理性真理。这从“妹子”的含义清楚可知，“妹子”是指理性的智性真理（参看<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>节）。若不通过天堂的婚姻，谁也看不出“妹子”表示理性真理；因为从天堂婚姻降下来的事物彼此联结起来，类似世上的血亲和姻亲关系（对此，参看<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>节），并且联结的方式有无数种。天堂的婚姻唯独存在于神性良善与神性真理之间。该婚姻在人里面孕育出理解能力、理性能力和认知能力；因为若没有天堂婚姻的这种孕育，人决无法被赋予理解力，理性或知识，因而无法成为一个人。因此，他从天堂婚姻汲取得越多，就越是人。天堂婚姻存在于主自己里面，因而主就是该婚姻本身，因为祂是神性良善本身，同时也是神性真理本身。天使和人类照着其对主之爱和对邻之仁，以及源于这些的信而具有天堂婚姻；也就是说，照着所具有的主的良善和由此而来的真理而具有该婚姻。这时，他们被称为“儿女”，彼此的关系就是“姐妹和兄弟”，不过也有不同。理性真理之所以被称为“妹子”，是因为它是从神性良善进入对理性真理的情感的流注而成孕的。以此方式在理性中所孕育的良善被称为“兄弟”，由此而来的真理被称为“妹子”。这一点从本章12节亚伯拉罕所说的话看得更清楚，即“况且她也实在是我的妹子，她是我父亲的女儿，不是我母亲的女儿，后来作了我的妻子”。</p>

She is my sister. That this signifies rational truth, is evident from the signification of a "sister," as being rational intellectual truth (see n. 1495). That rational truth is a "sister," can be seen 
only from the heavenly marriage; for the things which descend from this have kinships among themselves like the relationships and connections on earth (concerning which see n. 685, 917); and this with 
indefinite variety. The heavenly marriage itself exists solely between the Divine good and the Divine truth. From this there are conceived in man the intellectual, the rational, and the faculty of 
knowing; for without conception from the heavenly marriage man cannot possibly be imbued with understanding, with reason, or with knowledge, and consequently cannot be man. In proportion therefore as 
he receives from the heavenly marriage, in the same proportion is he man. The heavenly marriage is in the Lord Himself, thus the Lord is this marriage itself, for He is the Divine good itself and at 
the same time the Divine truth. Angels and men are in the heavenly marriage insofar as they are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, and insofar as they are thence in faith; that is, 
insofar as they are in the Lord's good, and thence in truth; and they are then called "daughters and sons," and in their relation to one another "sisters and brothers;" but this with differences. The 
reason why rational truth is called a "sister" is that it is conceived from the influx of the Divine good into the affection of rational truths; the good which is thence in the rational is called a 
"brother," and the truth which is thence, a "sister." But this will be better seen from what is said by Abraham in verse 12 of this chapter: "and moreover truly she is my sister; she is the daughter of 
my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife." </p>

'She is my sister' means rational truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sister' as rational intellectual truth, dealt with in <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>. That rational truth is meant by 'a sister' cannot be seen by 
anyone except from the heavenly marriage; for the things that descend from that marriage have links with one another - resembling the ties of blood-relationships and relationships by marriage on earth, 
concerning which see <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a> - and in ways endlessly varying. The heavenly marriage exists solely between Divine Good and Divine Truth. Conceived from that marriage there exist with man the capacities 
to understand, to be rational, and to have knowledge; for without this conception from ;the heavenly marriage no one can possibly be endowed with understanding, reason, or knowledge, and cannot consequently 
be a human being. Insofar therefore as he draws from the heavenly marriage he is human. The heavenly marriage exists within the Lord Himself, so that the Lord is that marriage itself; for He 
is Divine Good itself and at the same time Divine Truth. The heavenly marriage exists with angels and men insofar as love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and consequently insofar as faith 
derived from these exist with them, that is, insofar as the Lord's good and the truth derived from this do so. When this is the case with them they are called 'daughters and sons', and in relation 
to one another 'sisters and brothers', but with differences. The reason rational truth is called 'a sister' is that it is conceived from the influx of Divine Good into the affection for rational truths. 
The good conceived in this way in the rational is called 'a brother', and the truth 'a sister'. But this will be clearer from the words spoken by Abraham in verse 12 of this chapter, 'And also she 
is truly my sister, my father's daughter but not my mother's daughter; and she became my wife'. </p>

`Soror mea haec': quod significet verum rationale, constat ex significatione `sororis' quod sit verum intellectuale rationale, de qua n. 1495. Quod verum rationale sit `soror,' non aliunde constare 
potest quam ex conjugio caelesti; quae enim inde descendunt, proximitates inter se habent, sicut consanguinitates et affinitates in terra, de quibus videatur n. 685, 917, et hoc cum varietate indefinita; 
ipsum conjugium caeleste est solum inter Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum; inde apud hominem concipitur intellectuale, rationale et scientificum, nam absque conceptione ex conjugio caelesti nusquam 
homo potest intellectu, nec ratione, nec scientia imbui, proinde non potest esse homo; quantum itaque ex conjugio caelesti ducit, tantum est homo. In Ipso Domino est conjugium caeleste, ita ut Dominus 
sit ipsum illud conjugium, est enim Ille ipsum Divinum Bonum et simul Divinum Verum; angeli et homines in conjugio caelesti sunt quantum in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum, et quantum 
inde in fide, hoc est, quantum in bono Domini ac inde in vero, et tunc dicuntur `filiae et filii,' ac inter se `sorores et fratres,' sed hoc cum differentia. Quod verum rationale dicatur `soror,' est 
causa quia concipitur ab influxu Divini Boni in affectionem verorum rationalium; bonum quod inde in rationali vocatur `frater,' et verum quod inde, `soror'; sed hoc melius constabit ex illis quae in vers. 
12: hujus capitis ab Abrahamo dicuntur, `Et etiam vere soror mea, filia patris mei illa, verumtamen non filia matris meae, et facta mihi in uxorem.' </p>
