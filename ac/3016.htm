<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3016节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3016.</strong>“亚伯拉罕老了，到了日子”表当主的人性变成神性的状态来临时。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表，以及“老了”或“上了年纪”、“日子”和“到了日子”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕”是指主（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="1965.htm">1965</a>，<a href="1989.htm">1989</a>，<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="2172.htm">2172</a>，<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>，<a href="2501.htm">2501</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>节等）；“老了”或“上了年纪”是指脱去人类之物，披上天堂之物（参看<a href="1854.htm">1854</a>，<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>节），当 论及主时，是指披上神性；“日子”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）；“到了日子”是指当这状态来临之时。“老了”和“到了日子”之所以表示这类事物，是因为天使没有老的概念，也没有“到了日子”所指的变老的概念，而只有对他们所在生命状态的概念。在这种生命状态中，人们会经历生命的各个不同阶段，直到最后一个阶段。也就是说，他们会相继脱去人类之物，披上天堂之物。人类从小到老的生命无非是从尘世到天堂的发展过程，而最后一个阶段，也就是死亡，是从这一个生命进入下一个生命的过渡本身。因此，埋葬就是复活，因为埋葬是完全脱落的过程（参看<a href="2916.htm">2916</a>，<a href="2917.htm">2917</a>节）。这就是天使所拥有的观念，“到了日子”和“老了”在内义上并非表示别的什么。内义主要为天使和具有天使心智的人而存在。</p>

Abraham being old was come into days. That this signifies when the state was at hand that the Lord's Human should be made Divine, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord (see 
n. 1893, 1965, 1989, 2011, 2172, 2198, 2501, 2833, 2836, and many other places); and from the signification of "old," or of "old age," as being to put off what is human, and put on what is heavenly (see 
n. 1854, 2198); and when predicated of the Lord, as being to put on the Divine. The same is evident also from the signification of "day," as being state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788); and 
hence from the signification of "coming into days," as being when the state was at hand. Such things are signified by "old" and "coming into days," for the reason that the angels have no idea of old age, 
or of the advancing age which is meant by "coming into days;" but an idea of state in regard to the life in which they are; and therefore when mention is made in the Word of advancement in age, and 
of old age, the angels who are with man can have no other idea than of the state of life in which the persons are, and in which men are while passing through their ages even to the last; namely, that 
they thus successively put off what is human and put on what is heavenly. For human life, from infancy to old age, is nothing else than a progression from the world to heaven; and the last age, which 
is death, is the transition itself. Therefore burial is resurrection, because it is a complete putting off (see n. 2916, 2917). As the angels are in such an idea, nothing else can be signified by "coming 
into days" and by "old age" in the internal sense which is principally for angels and for men who are angelic minds. </p>

'Abraham, being old, was advanced in years' means when the state was reached in which the Lord's Human could become Divine. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord, dealt with 
in <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="1965.htm">1965</a>, <a href="1989.htm">1989</a>, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="2172.htm">2172</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="2501.htm">2501</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>, and many times elsewhere; from the meaning of 'old' or old age as casting off what is human and putting on what is heavenly, dealt with in <a href="1854.htm">1854</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, and when it has reference to the Lord, putting on what is Divine; and from the meaning of 'day' as state, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, and therefore from the meaning of 'advanced 
in years' as the point when a state has been reached. The reason why 'old' and 'advanced in years' mean these things is that with angels the notion of old age does not exist, nor that of getting older, 
meant by 'advanced in years', only the notion of state as regards the life that is theirs. Consequently when getting older or old age is mentioned in the Word the angels present with man can have 
no other idea than that of the state of life that is theirs or that is men's as they pass through the different stages of life until they reach the last, that is to say, as they accordingly cast off what 
is human and put on what is heavenly. For man's life from infancy to old age is nothing else than an advance from the world towards heaven, the last stage of which is death and the actual transition 
from one life to the next. Burial therefore is also resurrection since the casting-off process is completed then, <a href="2916.htm">2916</a>, <a href="2917.htm">2917</a>. Such being the idea that angels have, nothing else can be meant by 'advanced 
in years' and by 'old age' in the internal sense - the sense which exists primarily for angels and for men who have minds like those of angels. </p>

`Abraham senex cum venit in dies': quod significet cum adesset status quod Humanum Domini fieret Divinum, constat a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, de qua n. 1893, 1965, 1989, 2011, 2172, 
2198, 2501, 2833, 2836, et alibi multoties; a significatione `senis seu senectutis' quod sit exuere quod humanum est, ac induere quod caeleste, de qua n. 1854, 2198, et cum praedicatur de Domino, 
quod sit induere Divinum: et a significatione `diei' quod sit status, de qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788; inde `venire in dies' quod sit cum adesset status.  Quod `senex' et `venire in dies' illa 
significent, causa est quia apud angelos nulla idea senectutis est, nec progredientis aetatis, quae est `venire in dies,' sed idea status quoad vitam in qua {1}sunt; quare cum progressus aetatis et senectus 
nominatur in Verbo, angeli qui apud hominem, non possunt aliam ideam habere quam status vitae in qua sunt, et in qua homines cum percurrunt aetates usque ad ultimam, quod nempe successive sic exuant 
humanum, ac induant caeleste, nam vita humana non aliud est ab infantia ad senium, quam progressio a mundo ad caelum, ac ultima quae est mors, est ipse transitus; sepultura ideo est resurrectio 
quia plenaria exuitio, n. 2916, 2917; quia {2}angeli in tali idea sunt, non aliud per `venire in dies' et per `senectutem' in sensu interno, qui principaliter pro angelis est, et pro hominibus qui angelicae 
{3}mentes sunt, significari potest. @1 i illi$  @2 after sunt$  @3 mentis$  </p>
