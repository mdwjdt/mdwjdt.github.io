<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3696节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3696.</strong>“就躺在那地方”表这种状态的宁静。这从“躺”的含义清楚可知，“躺”是指处于宁静的状态，因为“躺”或“睡”并不表示别的。就内义而言，这就是“躺”的含义，这一点从紧接着所论述的圣言中的其它经文可以看出来。对那些要经历重生的人，也就是此处就内在代表意义而言所论述的主题来说，情况是这样：他们首先处于宁静的状态，或外在平安的状态，因为外在平安，或在外在事物中所体验到的平安就被称为宁静。事实上，这种宁静是由平安的神性状态产生的。平安的神性状态通过除去恶欲和谬念而从至内在存在并显现于外在事物；因为一切动荡都是由这些恶欲和谬念造成的。此外，每个人在生命初，也就是婴儿时都处于宁静的状态；但随着年龄增长，或逐渐长大成人，他远离了这种状态，因为他任由自己陷入世俗的挂虑，因而陷入由自我之爱和尘世之爱的贪欲，以及源于这些的虚假所造成的焦虑中。<br />正在重生之人所具有的新生命差不多也是这种情形。一开始，他会处于宁静的状态；但随着他进入一种新生命，他也会进入一种非宁静的状态。因为他以前所吸收的邪恶与虚假现在开始浮现出来，并困扰他，以至于最后他会经历恶魔团伙所带来的试探和烦恼，这些恶魔不断试图摧毁其新生命的状态。然而，此人从至内在处于平安的状态。若非这种状态从至内在存在于他身上，他根本不会去争战，因为在一切冲突中，他不断将这种状态当作目的来关注；他若没有这样的目的，永远不会有权能和力量去争战。而且，这就是他为何得胜的原因。由于这就是所关注的目的，所以一旦争战或试探结束，他也会进入这种状态。这就像继秋冬状态之后的春天状态，或继傍晚和夜间之后的黎明状态。属灵之物上的平安状态就类似于属世之物上的春天和黎明（参看<a href="1726.htm">1726</a>，<a href="2780.htm">2780</a>节）；平安来自良善与真理，动荡来自邪恶与虚假（<a href="3170.htm">3170</a>节）。<br />在圣言中，“躺”表宁静的状态。这一点从以下经文可以看出来，摩西五经：<br />你们若遵行我的律例，谨守我的诫命，实行它们，我要赐平安在地上，你们躺卧，无人惊吓你们；我要叫恶兽从地上息灭，刀剑也必不经过你们的地。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.3.htm">26:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“躺卧”明显论及平安和宁静的状态。“恶兽”表恶欲（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="908.htm">908</a>节），它们必“息灭”。“刀剑”表与真理争战的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>节），它们“必不经过”。所有这一切表明，平安和平安的宁静来自良善与真理，对它的毁灭则来自邪恶与虚假。<br />以赛亚书：<br />豺狼必与绵羊羔同居，豹子与山羊羔同卧；牛犊与少壮狮子同群；小孩子要牵引它们。牛必与熊同食，牛犊必与小熊同卧。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.6.htm">11:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论述的是主和祂国度中的平安状态。它们“同卧”表他们不可能受到任何邪恶或虚假的侵扰。何西阿书：<br />当那日，我必为他们与田野的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的爬行物立约；我必从这地折断弓剑，止息争战，使他们安然躺卧。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>）<br />此处“躺卧”同样表示除去造成动荡的虚假与邪恶后的宁静状态。<br />诗篇：<br />我躺下睡觉，我醒着，耶和华都保佑我。虽有成万的百姓来周围攻击我，我也不怕。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗3.5.htm">3:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗3.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“躺下睡觉”表宁静和安全的状态。<br />我必平安躺下睡觉，因为独有你耶和华使我安然居住。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗4.8.htm">4:8</a>）<br /><br />祂使我躺卧在青草地上，领我在可安歇的水边；祂使我的灵魂苏醒。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.3.htm">3</a>）<br />从这些经文明显可知，“躺或躺卧”表示平安和宁静的状态；“躺在那地方”表示状态的宁静，因为就内义而言，“地方”表示状态（<a href="3692.htm">3692</a>节）。</p>

And lay down in that place. That this signifies the tranquillity of the state, is evident from the signification of "lying down," as being to be in a state of tranquillity; for "lying down" and "sleeping" 
signify nothing else. That in the internal sense this is the signification of "lying down," may, also be seen from other passages in the word, concerning which just below. With those who are to 
be regenerated, who are here treated of in the internal representative sense, the case is that first of all they are in a state of tranquillity, or in a state of external peace (for external peace, or 
peace in externals, is called "tranquillity"); and the same is produced from the Divine state of peace that is inmostly within it; and it comes forth into the externals through the removal of cupidities 
and falsities; for these are what cause all unrest. Moreover at the beginning of his life, that is, during his infancy, every man is in a state of tranquillity; but as he advances in life, that is, 
grows up to manhood, he removes himself from this state, because he gives himself up to worldly cares, and consequently to anxieties caused by the cupidities of the love of self and of the world, and 
the derivative falsities. [2] The case is almost the same with the new life in the man who is being regenerated: at first he is in a state of tranquillity; but as he passes into a new life, he also 
passes at the same time into an untranquil state; for the evils and falsities with which he had before become imbued emerge and come forth, and disturb him, and this at last to such a degree that he is 
in temptations and vexations inflicted by the diabolical crew, who are continually striving to destroy the state of his new life. Yet inmostly the man is in a state of peace, for unless this were with 
him inmostly, he would not combat, for in his battlings he is continually looking to this state as the end, and unless he had such an end, he would in no wise have power and strength to combat. This 
moreover is the reason why he overcomes; and because this is the end in view, he also comes into this state after the combats or temptations. This is like the state of spring, which succeeds the state 
of autumn and winter; or it is like the state of dawn, which succeeds evening and night. (That a state of peace in spiritual things is like spring and dawn in natural things, may be seen above, n. 
1726, 2780; and that peace is from good and truth, and unrest from what is evil and false, n. 3170.) [3] That in the Word "to lie down" signifies a state of tranquillity, may be seen from the following 
passages. In Moses: </p>
<p>     If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and do them, I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause the 
evil wild beast to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword pass through your land (Lev. 26:3, 6); </p>
<p>where "lying down" is manifestly predicated of a state of peace and tranquillity; "evil beasts" 
denote the cupidities of evil (n. 45, 46, 908), which shall "cease;" the "sword" denotes, falsity fighting against truth (n. 2799), which shall not "pass through;" all which shows that peace and the 
tranquillity of peace are from good and truth, and that the destruction thereof is from evils and falsities. [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down 
with the kid; and the calf and the young lion together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together (Isa. 11:6-7); </p>
<p>     where the 
Lord is treated of, and the state of peace in His kingdom; that they shall "lie down together" signifies that they cannot be infested by any evil and falsity. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     In that day will I make 
a covenant for them with the wild beast of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and war out of the land, and will 
make them to lie down in confidence (Hos. 2:18); </p>
<p>where in like manner "to lie down" signifies a state of tranquillity on the removal of falsities and evils, which occasion unrest. [5] In David: </p>
<p> 
    I will lay me down and sleep; and I will awake, for Jehovah sustaineth me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people that have set themselves against me round about (Ps. 3:5-6); </p>
<p>where 
"to lie down and sleep" signifies a state of tranquillity and security. Again: </p>
<p>     In peace I will both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, Jehovah alone, makest me to dwell in confidence (Ps. 4:8). And 
again: </p>
<p>     He will make me to lie down in green pastures; He will lead me to the waters of rest; He will restore my soul (Ps. 23:2-3). </p>
<p>From these passages it is evident that a state of peace and 
tranquillity is signified by "lying down;" and that by "lying down in that place" is signified the tranquillity of the state, for in the internal sense "place" signifies state (n. 3692). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3696</b></p><p><b>3696.</b>
'And lay down in that place' means the serenity of that state. This is clear from the meaning of 'lying down' as being in a state of serenity, for lying down or sleeping is nothing else. This meaning 
which 'lying down' has in the internal sense may also be seen from other places in the Word, which are dealt with immediately below. In the case of those who are to undergo regeneration, and who are 
the subject here in the representative internal sense, they are first of all in a state of serenity or external peace, for external peace or peace experienced in external things is called serenity. Indeed 
it is a product of the Divine state of peace which exists inmostly and which manifests itself in external things through the removal of evil desires and false ideas; for it is these that cause all 
unrest. Furthermore everyone at the start of his life, that is, in early childhood, is in a state of calm, but as one advances in, years or grows up he moves away from that state, for he gives himself 
up to worldly concerns and consequent anxious cares caused by the desires of self-love and of love of the world, and by falsities that spring from these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Something very similar to this occurs 
with the new life with one who is being regenerated. At first he experiences a state of serenity, but as he moves on into the new life so he moves into a state that is not serene. For evils and falsities 
which he has taken into himself previously now emerge and show themselves, and these trouble him, so much so at length that he undergoes temptations and trials from the devil's crew who try all 
the time to destroy his state of new life. But despite this a state of peace exists with him inmostly. But for its presence inmostly he would not put up any fight at all, for in all the conflicts he experiences 
he sees that state as the end in view. If that end were not in view he would never have the power and strength to fight. And this is also what enables him to overcome. And since it is the end 
in view he also enters that state once conflict or temptations are past. It is like the state of spring which follows that of autumn and winter, or like the state of dawn following evening and night. 
Regarding the resemblance of the state of peace in spiritual things to spring and dawn in natural ones, see <a href="1726.htm">1726</a>, <a href="2780.htm">2780</a>; and as regards peace being the result of goodness and truth, but unrest the result 
of evil and falsity, <a href="3170.htm">3170</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'lying down' in the Word means a state of serenity may be seen from the following places: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If you walk in My statutes and observe My commandments 
and do them, I will give peace in the land, and you will lie down, and none will make you afraid. And I will cause evil wild animals to cease from the land, and the sword will not pass through your 
land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:3,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:3, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Lying down' clearly applies to a state of peace and serenity. 'Evil wild animals' stands for desires for evil, <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="908.htm">908</a>, which 'are going to cease'. 'The sword' stands for 
falsity in conflict with truth, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, which 'is not going to pass through the land'. From this it is also evident that peace and the serenity of peace is the result of goodness and truth, and the destruction 
of it is the result of evils and falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion together; and a 
little child will lead them. And the young cow and the beer will feed; their young will lie down together. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord and to the state of peace existing in His kingdom. 'They 
will lie down together' stands for their being unable to be infested by anything evil or false. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make for them a covenant on that day with the wild beasts of the field, and with 
the birds of the air, and with the creeping things of the earth. And I will abolish<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the bow, and the sword, and war from the land, and I will make them lie down in safety. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here likewise 
'lying down' stands for a state of serenity following the removal of falsities and evils which are responsible for unrest. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lie down and sleep, and will awake again, for 
Jehovah sustains me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who set themselves against me round about. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%203:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 3:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Lying down and sleeping' stands for a state of serenity and security. In 
the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
In peace I will both lie down and sleep, because You, O Jehovah, alone make me dwell with confidence. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%204:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 4:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
He will make me to down in green pastures; 
He will lead me to still waters; He will restore my soul. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2023:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 23:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these places it is evident that a state of peace and serenity is described by 'lying down', and that 'lying down in 
that place' means the serenity of the state - for 'place' in the internal sense is state, <a href="3692.htm">3692</a>.

`Et cubuit in loco illo':  quod significet tranquillitatem status, constat a significatione `cubare' quod sit in statu tranquillitatis esse; cubatio enim et dormitio non aliud est; quod `cubare' in sensu 
interno illud sit, constare quoque potest ab aliis locis in Verbo, de quibus mox infra.  Cum regenerandis, de quibus hic in sensu interno repraesentativo agitur, ita se habet, quod omnium primo sint 
in statu tranquillitatis, seu in statu pacis externae, nam pax externa seu {1}in externis vocatur tranquillitas; producitur etiam a statu pacis Divino qui intime, et existit in externis per id quod 
cupiditates et falsitates removeantur, hae enim sunt quae omnem irrequiem causantur; omnis etiam homo in statu tranquillitatis est in principio vitae suae seu in infantia, sed quantum homo in vitam 
pergit, seu adolescit, tantum a statu illo se removet, quia se dat in curas mundanus, et inde anxietates per cupiditates amoris sui et mundi, et per falsitates inde: [2] {2}paene consimiliter se habet 
cum vita nova apud hominem qui regeneratur; principio est ei status tranquillitatis, sed sicut in vitam novam transit, ita etiam in statum intranquillum; emergunt enim et prodeunt mala et falsa, quae 
prius imbuerat, et perturbant illum, et tandem usque adeo ut in tentationibus et vexationibus sit a turba diabolica, quae continue connititur statum vitae ejus novae destruere; sed usque est status pacis 
ei intime, qui nisi intime foret, non pugnaret, spectat enim continue illum in pugnis in quibus est, ut finem, qui nisi {3}esset finis, nusquam ei foret vis et robur (x)ad pugnandum; inde quoque 
est quod vincat; et quia ille est finis, etiam post pugnas seu tentationes in illum statum venit; est ille sicut status veris, qui post statum autumni et hiemis succedit, seu sicut status aurorae qui 
post vesperam et noctem; quod status pacis in spiritualibus sit instar {4}veris et aurorae in naturalibus, videatur n. 1726, 2780; et quod pax a bono et vero sit, et irrequies a malo et falso, n. 3170. 
[3] Quod `cubare' in Verbo significet tranquillitatis statum, constare potest ab his locis; apud Mosen,      Si in statutis Meis ambulaveritis, et praecepta Mea      observaveritis, et feceritis illa, 
. . . dabo pacem in terra,      et cubabitis, et nemo terrefaciens; et cessare faciam feram      malam e terra, et gladius non transibit per terram vestram,      Lev. xxvi 3, 6; </p>
<p>`cubare' manifeste 
de statu pacis et tranquillitatis; `fera mala' pro cupiditatibus mali, n. 45, 46, 908, quae `cessabunt'; `gladius' pro falso pugnante contra verum, n. 2799, quod `non transibit'; inde quoque patet 
quod pax et pacis tranquillitas sit a bono et vero, {5}et quod destructio ejus a malis et falsis: [4] apud Esaiam,      Commorabitur lupus cum agno, et pardus cum haedo cubabit, et      vitulus et 
leo juvenis una, et puer parvus ducet eos; et      juvenca et ursus pascent, una cubabunt foetus eorum, xi (x)5,      6, 7; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino et de statu pacis in regno Ipsius; `cubabunt una' pro quod 
non infestari poterunt ab ullo malo et falso: apud Hosheam,      Pangam illis foedus in die illo cum fera agri, et cum ave      caelorum, et reptili terrae; et arcum, et gladium, et bellum      frangam 
de terra, et cubare faciam eos confidenter, ii 18; </p>
<p>{6}pariter `cubare' pro statu tranquillitatis remotis falsis et malis, quae inducunt {7}irrequiem: [5] apud Davidem,      Ego cubabo et dormiam, 
et expergiscar, quia Jehovah sustentat      me; non timebo a myriadibus populi, qui circumcirca ponunt se      contra me, Ps. iii 6, 7 [A.V. 5, 6]; </p>
<p>`cubare et dormire' pro statu tranquillitatis 
et securitatis: apud eundem,       In pace simul cubabo et dormiam, quia Tu Jehovah solus      confidenter me habitare facis, Ps. iv 9 [A.V. 8]:  et apud eundem,      In pascuis herbae cubare faciet 
me, ad aquas quietum ducet me; </p>
<p>     animam meam recreabit, Ps. xxiii 2, 3. Ex quibus patet quod status pacis et tranquillitatis per `cubare' describatur; et quod per `cubare in loco illo' significetur 
tranquillitas status, 'locus' enim in sensu interno est status, n. 3692. @1 i apparens$ @2 se habet similiter$ @3 foret$ @4 i status$ @5 mala et falsa sint, quae statum illum apud hominem
