And Noah entered the ark, as did his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him, because of the waters of the flood.<br />Noah entered the ark because of the waters of the flood means that while being tested he was protected. His sons as before symbolize truth, his wife goodness, and the sons' wives truth united to good. </p>

Verse 7. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, from before the waters of the flood. "Noah went into the ark, from before the waters of the flood" signifies 
that he was protected in temptation; by "sons" are signified truths, as before; by "wife" goods; by "sons' wives" truths conjoined with goods. </p>

Verse 7 And Noah went into the ark, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, from before the waters of the flood.  </p>
<p>'Noah went into the ark from before the waters of the flood' means 
that in temptation he was protected. 'Sons' mean truths, as previously, 'wife' goods, and 'sons' wives' truths joined to goods. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 740</b>
</p><b>740.</b>
Vers. 7.  Et intravit Noah, et filii ejus, et uxor ejus, et uxores filiorum ejus cum illo, in arcam, a coram aquis diluvii. 'Quod intraverit Noah in arcam a coram aquis diluvii' significat quod in tentatione 
tutatus: per 'filios' significantur, ut prius, vera: per 'uxorem' bona: per 'uxores filiorum' vera conjuncta bonis. </p>
