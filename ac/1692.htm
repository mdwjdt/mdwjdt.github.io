<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1692节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1692.</strong>几乎没人知道试探或试探的争战会产生什么效果。它们都是手段，用来击破和驱散恶与假，引发对它们的恐惧，不仅赋予良知，还由此强化这良知，从而使人重生。这就是为何正在重生之人都被引入争战、经历试探的原因。他们在肉身生活时若不经历它们，在来世也会经历，倘若他们还能重生的话，主的教会因此被称为精兵。不过，唯独主凭自己的力量和能力忍受最为残酷的试探的争战，因为祂被所有地狱包围，并不断战胜它们。<br />也唯独主在经历试探的争战之人里面斗争，并战胜。人凭自己的力量根本无法应对恶灵或地狱灵。因为他们与地狱联结得如此紧密，以致若一个被战胜，另一个必冲进来，如此直到永远。他们就象挤压堤坝每一部分的海水，若堤坝被缺口或裂缝冲破，海水会永不停息地涌流并涨溢，直到什么也不剩。若非唯独主在他里面忍受试探的争战，人的情形也是如此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1692.</strong> Hardly anyone can see what the battles of spiritual crisis accomplish. They are the means for dissolving and shaking off evil and falsity. They are also the means by which we develop a horror for evil and falsity, and gain not only conscience but strength of conscience; and this is the way we are reborn. For that reason, people who are regenerating are thrust into combat and undergo terrible trials — if not during their physical lives, then in the other life, assuming they can regenerate. In consequence, the Lord's church is called the church militant.<br />The Lord alone relied on his own strength or power to endure his spiritual crises and the savage conflicts they entailed. The hells all besieged him, and he continually gained total victory over them.<br />[2] It is the Lord alone who does the fighting in people facing their own spiritual battles, and who conquers. By our own power, we cannot accomplish anything at all against evil, hellish spirits, because they band together with the hells in such a way that if one hell were overcome the next would rush in to fill the void. This would continue forever. They are like the ocean beating on the individual stones in a jetty. If it managed to open a chink or a tiny crack in the jetty, it would never stop until it had broken down and overflowed the entire structure, leaving not a trace. That is how it would be if the Lord did not bear our battles by himself. </p>

Scarcely anyone can know what temptations, or combats of temptations, effect. They are the means by which evils and falsities are broken up and dispersed, and by which horror of them is induced; and 
not only is conscience given, but it is also strengthened thereby, and so the man is regenerated, which is the reason why they who are being regenerated are let into combats, and undergo temptations; 
and they who do not undergo them in the life of the body, do so in the other life, if they are capable of being regenerated, on which account the Lord's church is called militant. But the Lord alone sustained 
the most cruel combats of temptations by His own strength or His own power; for He was surrounded by all the hells, and continually conquered them.  [2] It is the Lord alone also who fights 
in the men who are in the combats of temptations, and who overcomes. Man from his own power can effect nothing at all against evil or infernal spirits; for they are so connected with the hells that if 
one were overcome, another would rush in, and so on forever. They are like the sea which presses upon every part of a dike; and if the dike should be broken through by a cleft or a crack, the sea would 
never cease to burst through and overflow, until nothing was left standing. So would it be with man unless the Lord alone sustained in him the combats of temptations. </p>

What temptations, or the conflicts that constitute temptations, accomplish, scarcely anyone is able to know. They are the means by which evils and falsities are broken up and dispersed. They are also 
the means by which an abhorrence of these is produced, and a conscience is not only given but also strengthened, and man is accordingly regenerated. This is the reason why those who are being regenerated 
are led into conflicts and undergo temptations and why those who do not experience them during their earthly life do so in the next life, provided they are such as can be regenerated. And it is for 
these reasons also that the Lord's Church is called 'militant'. The Lord alone however underwent from His own strength or power the most cruel conflicts that constitute temptations, for He was beset 
by all the hells and constantly overcame them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is also the Lord alone who fights in the temptation-conflicts of those who do undergo these. Man by his own power can accomplish nothing in the 
slightest against evil or hellish spirits, for they are so closely linked to the hells that if one were vanquished another would rush to take his place, and so on for ever. They are like the sea pressing 
against every part of a dike. If the dike were to develop a split or crack the sea would never cease to pour through and flood the land until nothing was left standing. It would be like this with 
man if the Lord alone did not bear up against the conflicts experienced by man in temptations. </p>

</p><b>1692.</b>
Quid tentationes seu pugnae tentationum efficiunt, vix aliquis scire potest; sunt illa media quibus resolvuntur et discutiuntur mala et falsa, et quibus inducitur pro illis horror, et non modo datur 
sed etiam corroboratur conscientia, et sic regeneratur homo; quae causa est quod qui regenerantur, mittantur in pugnas, et subeant tentationes; et qui non in vita corporis, illi in altera vita, si tales 
sint ut regenerari queant; quare Ecclesia Domini vocatur 'pugnans': se solus Dominus ex propriis viribus seu ex propria potentia sustinuit pugnas tentationum crudelissimas, nam omnibus infernis circumfusus 
fuit, et continue illa evicit: [2] solus Dominus etiam est Qui pugnas apud homines qui in pugnis tentationum sunt, et Qui vincit; homo ex propria potentia ne hilum efficere potest contra malos 
seu infernales spiritus, nam cohaerent cum infernis ita ut si unum superaretur alterum superirrueret, et sic in aeternum; sunt sicut mare quod incumbit singulis partibus aggeris, si perrumperetur agger 
rima se fossula, nusquam mare desineret quin perrumperet et inundaret usque dum nihil superstes sit; ita se haberet nisi Dominus soli sustineret pugnas tentationum apud hominem. </p>
