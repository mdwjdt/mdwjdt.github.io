Verses 10-13. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I will by no means give you straw. Go ye yourselves, get you straw 
where ye can find it; for nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service. And the people scattered into all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, 
Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day, as when there was straw. "And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers," signifies the sending forth and presence of those 
who most closely infest, and of those who most closely receive; "and they spoke to the people, saying," signifies perception; "Thus said Pharaoh," signifies about the infestations; "I will by no means 
give you straw," signifies no longer thence the most general memory-knowledges; "Go ye yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it," signifies that they should procure these for themselves elsewhere, 
wherever they could; "for nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service," signifies injections of falsities without diminution; "and the people scattered into all the land of Egypt," signifies 
that they overspread the natural mind on every side; "to gather stubble for straw," signifies to find some truth of memory-knowledge; "and the taskmasters were urgent," signifies that they who 
most closely infested were insistent; "saying, Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day," signifies that they should serve falsities so called in every state; "as when there was straw," signifies 
just as they served their truths so called. </p>

Verses 10-13 And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and said to the people - they said, Thus said Pharaoh, By no means do I give you straw. Go yourselves, get yourselves straw 
from where you will find it, for there will be no reduction at all of your service. And the people scattered themselves into all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. And the taskmasters were 
urgent, saying, Finish your work,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> your stint for the day,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> as when there was straw.  </p>
<p>'And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out' means the sending out and presence of those in 
the nearest position to molest and those in the nearest position to receive. 'And said to the people - they said' means perception. 'Thus said Pharaoh' means regarding the molestations. 'By no means 
do I give you straw' means that the most general factual knowledge was no longer made available from that source. 'Go yourselves, get yourselves straw from where you will find it' means that they should 
acquire that knowledge from wherever else they could. 'For there will be no reduction at all of your service' means that the introduction of falsities will go on undiminished. 'And the people scattered 
themselves into all the land of Egypt' means that they spread their natural mind in all directions. 'To gather stubble for straw' means to find some true factual knowledge. 'And the taskmasters 
were urgent' means that those in the nearest position to molest were insistent. 'Saying, Finish your work, your stint for the day' means that they should serve falsities so called in every state. 'As 
when there was straw' means as they had served their truths so called.

Vers. 10-13.  Et exiverunt exactores populi, et moderatores ejus, et dixerunt ad populum, dicendo, Ita dixit Pharao, Nequaquam do vobis paleam.  Vos ite, sumite vobis paleam, ex quo inveneritis, quia 
nihil detrahetur e servitio vestro quicquam.  Et dispersit se populus in omnem terram Aegypti ad colligendum stipulam ad paleam. Et exactores urgentes, dicendo, Absolvite opera vestra, verbum diei in 
die ejus, quemadmodum in esse palea.  `Et exiverunt exactores populi et moderatores ejus' significat emissionem et praesentiam illorum qui proxime infestant et qui proxime recipiunt: `et dixerunt ad 
populum, dicendo' significat perceptionem: `Ita dixit Pharao' significat de infestationibus: `Nequaquam do vobis paleam' significat quod non amplius inde scientifica communissima: `Vos ite, sumite vobis 
paleam, es quo inveneritis' significat quod sibi illa {1}comparent aliunde ubi possent: `quia nihil detrahetur de servitio vestro quicquam' significat injectiones falsorum absque diminutione: `et 
dispersit se populus in omnem terram Aegypti' (x)significat quod diffunderent mentem naturalem undequaque: `ad colligendum stipulam ad paleam' significat ad inveniendum aliquod verum scientificum: `et 
exactores urgentes' significat proxime infestantes quod instarent: `dicendo, Absolvite opera vestra, verbum diei in die suo' significat ut servirent falsis ita dictis in quolibet statu: `quemadmodum 
in esse palea' significat sicut suis veris ita dictis. 	@1 compararent altered to comparent A  compararent I$ </p>
