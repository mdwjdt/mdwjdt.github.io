<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5757节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5757.</strong>“尚且从迦南地带回来还你”表由于宗教信仰而交付。这从“带回来”和“迦南地”的含义清楚可知：“带回来”是指交付（参看<a href="5624.htm">5624</a>节）；“迦南地”是指他们的宗教信仰。“迦南地”具有各种含义，这是因为它就是那种包含许多意义的事物。它表示主的国度，也表示教会，由此还表示教会成员，因为他就是一个教会。迦南地因具有这些意义，故也表示教会的属天元素，也就是爱之良善；还表示教会的属灵元素，也就是信之真理等等。所以，它在此表示教会所拥有宗教信仰；因为是教会的宗教信仰使得一个人思想不可声称真理与良善是自己的。由此可见，为何一个词有时具有多种意义；因为当这个词将许多意义包含在一个整体里面时，它也能照内义上的思路所要求的而传递一个具体意义。“迦南地”表示主的国（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>），也表示教会（<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）。这个词所具有的其它一切意义皆从这两个意义流出。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5757</b></p><p><b>5757.</b>
We brought back to thee out of the land of Canaan. That this signifies submitted from a principle of religion, is evident from the signification of "bringing back," as being to submit (see n. 5624); 
and from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as being what is religious. The "land of Canaan" signifies various things, for the reason that it signifies that which includes very many things; for 
it signifies the Lord's kingdom, the church, and consequently the man of the church, because he is a church; and as it signifies these, it signifies also the celestial which is of the church, namely, 
the good of love; and also its spiritual, which is the truth of faith, and so on; here therefore it signifies the religious principle which is of the church; for it is of the religious principle of 
the church that no one ought to claim truth and good to himself. From these things it is plain why the same expression sometimes signifies a number of things; for when it involves several things in the 
complex, it also signifies those which it involves, according to the series of things in the internal sense. That the "land of Canaan" is the Lord's kingdom, see n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705; 
and also the church, n. 3686, 3705, 4447. From these flow its other significations. </p>

'We brought back to you from the land of Canaan' means has been submitted, as the result of religious belief. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing back' as submitting, dealt with in <a href="5624.htm">5624</a>, and 
from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan' as their religious belief. 'The land of Canaan' has various meanings, and this is because it is the kind of thing that includes very many meanings. It means the 
Lord's kingdom and it means the Church, as a consequence of which it also means the member of the Church, for he is a Church. Having these meanings that land also means the celestial element of the 
Church, which is the good of love, and the spiritual element of it too, which is the truth of faith; and so on. Here therefore a religious belief which the Church possesses is meant; for the Church's 
religious belief is what causes a person to think that he should not lay claim to truth and good as his own. From this one may see why a single expression sometimes has many meanings; for when many meanings 
are included within an overall one, an expression can then convey a particular meaning as the train of thought in the internal sense may demand. As regards 'the land of Canaan' meaning the Lord's 
kingdom, see <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>; and as regards its meaning the Church, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. All the other meanings which that expression possesses flow from these two. </p>

`Reduximus ad te e terra Canaan':  quod significet submissum sit ex religioso, constat ex significatione `reducere' quod sit submittere, de qua n. 5624; et ex significatione `terrae Canaanis' quod sit 
{1}religiosum; `terra Canaan' significat varia, ex causa quia significat tale quod includit perplura, significat enim regnum Domini et significat Ecclesiam, consequenter etiam hominem Ecclesiae, nam 
is est Ecclesia; et quia illa significat, etiam significat caeleste quod est Ecclesiae, nempe bonum amoris, et quoque spirituale ejus, quod est verum fidei, et sic porro; hic itaque religiosum quod 
Ecclesiae; ex religioso enim Ecclesiae est quod non vindicandum sibi verum et bonum.  Ex his patet cur una vox quandoque plura significat, cum enim in complexu plura involvit, tunc quoque significat illa 
quae involvit secundum seriem rerum in sensu interno.  Quod `terra Canaan' sit regnum Domini, videatur n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705; et quod sit Ecclesia, n. 3686, 3705, 4447; ex his fluunt 
reliquae ejus significationes. @1 ex religioso quod Ecclesiae$ </p>
