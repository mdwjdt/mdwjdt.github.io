THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-7. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto Pharaoh, and speak unto him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go that they may serve Me. For if thou 
refuse to let them go, and if thou still withhold them, behold, the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the herd, and on the 
flock; a very grievous pestilence. And Jehovah shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of the Egyptians, and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the sons of Israel. And Jehovah 
appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this word in the land. And Jehovah did this word on the morrow, and all the cattle of the Egyptians died; and of the cattle of the sons of 
Israel died not one. And Pharaoh sent, and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of Israel dead; and Pharaoh's heart was made heavy, and he did not let the people go. "And Jehovah said unto 
Moses," signifies instruction anew; "Come unto Pharaoh, and speak unto him," signifies the appearance of truth from the Divine with those who infest; "Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews," signifies 
a command from the Lord the God of the church; "Let My people go that they may serve Me," signifies that they should leave those who are of the spiritual church so that they may worship the Lord; 
"for if thou refuse to let them go, and if thou still withhold them," signifies if they should still be determined to infest; "behold the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is in the field," 
signifies the vastation of the truth and good of faith which they have from the church wherein they had been; "on the horses, on the asses, on the camels," signifies the intellectual things and the 
memory-knowledges of the truth that is of faith; "on the herd, and on the flock," signifies the things of the will; "a very grievous pestilence," signifies a consumption in general; "and Jehovah shall 
sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of the Egyptians," signifies the difference between the truths and goods of faith of those who are of the spiritual church, and the truths and goods 
of faith which are of the church with those who infest; "and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the sons of Israel," signifies that they shall not be consumed; "and Jehovah appointed a 
set time," signifies predetermination; "saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this word in the land," signifies theirs forever in respect to the things that belong to the truth and good of faith of the church; 
"and Jehovah did this word on the morrow," signifies the effect according to the predetermination; "and all the cattle of the Egyptians died," signifies the consumption of the truth and good of 
faith with those who infest; "and of the cattle of the sons of Israel died not one," signifies that nothing of faith was consumed with those who were of the spiritual church; "and Pharaoh sent, and behold 
there was not so much as one of the cattle of Israel dead," signifies that this was made known to those who infest; "and Pharaoh's heart was made heavy," signifies obstinacy; "and he did not let 
the people go," signifies that they did not leave them. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-7 And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and you are to tell him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Send My people away, and let them serve Me. For if you refuse 
to send them away and you still hold them back, behold, the hand of Jehovah will be on your livestock that are in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the herd, and on the flock 
- an extremely severe pestilence. And Jehovah will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of the Egyptians, and nothing will die of all that belongs to the children of 
Israel. And Jehovah set a fixed time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah will do this thing in the land. And Jehovah did this thing on the morrow, and all the livestock of the Egyptians died; and of the livestock 
of the children of Israel not one died. And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died. And Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he did not send the people away.  </p>
<p>'And 
Jehovah said to Moses' means fresh instruction. 'Go to Pharaoh, and you are to tell him' means the appearance of the truth from God among those engaged in molestation. 'Thus said Jehovah the God 
of the Hebrews' means a command from the Lord, the God of the Church. 'Send My people away, and let them serve Me' means that they should leave those who belong to the spiritual Church, in order that 
these may worship the Lord. 'For if you refuse to send them away and you still hold them back' means if they obstinately continued to molest them. 'Behold, the hand of Jehovah will be on your livestock 
that are in the field' means the laying waste of the truth and good of faith which they had acquired from the Church to which they had belonged. 'On the horses, on the asses, on the camels' means intellectual 
concepts of and factual knowledge about the truth of faith. 'On the herd, and on the flock' means aspects of the will. 'An extremely severe pestilence' means an overall annihilation. 'And Jehovah 
will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of the Egyptians' means the difference between the forms of the truth and good of faith of those who belong to the spiritual 
Church and the forms of the truth and good of faith acquired from the Church which reside with those engaged in molestation. 'And nothing will die of all that belongs to the children of Israel' 
means that they will not be annihilated. 'And Jehovah set a fixed time' means a predetermining 'Saying, Tomorrow Jehovah will do this thing in the land' means that this is how it will be with them for 
evermore, so far as the forms of the truth and good of faith belonging to the Church are concerned. 'And Jehovah did this thing on the morrow' means putting into effect what was predetermined. 'And all 
the livestock of the Egyptians died' means an annihilation of the truth and good of faith with those engaged in molestation. 'And of the livestock of the children of Israel not one died' means that 
no annihilation of faith took place among those who belonged to the spiritual Church. 'And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died' means that it was made known to 
those engaged in molestation. 'And Pharaoh's heart was stubborn' means obstinacy. 'And he did not send the people away means that they did not leave them. </p>

SENSUS  INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers.  1-7.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Veni ad Pharaonem, et loquaris ad illum, Ita dixit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum, Dimitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi.  Quia si renuis tu dimittere, 
et adhuc tu detines illos, ecce manus Jehovae erit in pecus tuum quod in agro, in equos, in asinos, in camelos, in armentum, et in gregem, pestis gravis valde.  Et distinguet Jehovah inter pecus 
Israelis, et inter pecus Aegyptiorum, et non morietur de omni filiis Israelis quicquam.  Et posuit Jehovah tempus statum, dicendo, Cras faciet Jehovah verbum hoc in terra.  Et fecit Jehovah verbum 
hoc a crastino, et moriebatur omne pecus Aegyptiorum, et de pecore filiorum Israelis non moriebatur unum.  Et misit Pharao, et ecce non mortuum de pecore Israelis usque ad unum.  Et aggravatum cor Pharaonis, 
et non dimisit populum.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat e novo instructionem: `Veni ad Pharaonem: et loquaris ad illum' significat apparentiam veri a Divino apud illos qui infestant: 
`Ita dixit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum' significat mandatum a Domino {1}Deo Ecclesiae: `Dimitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi' significat ut relinquant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, ut colant Dominum: 
`quia si renuis tu dimittere, et adhuc tu detines illos' significat si adhuc obstinarent se ad infestandum: `ecce manus Jehovae erit in pecus tuum quod in agro' significat vastationem veri et boni 
fidei {2}quae illis ab Ecclesia e qua fuerant: `in equos, in asinos, in camelos' significat intellectualia et scientifica veri quod fidei: `in armentum et in gregem' significat (m)voluntaria(n): `pestis 
gravis valde' significat consumptionem in communi: `et distinguet Jehovah inter pecus Israelis, et inter pecus Aegyptiorum' significat differentiam inter vera et bona fidei illorum qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali, et vera et bona fidei quae ab Ecclesia illis qui infestant: `et non morietur de omni filiis Israelis quicquam' significat quod non consumentur: `et posuit Jehovah tempus statum' significat 
praefinitionem: `dicendo Cras faciet Jehovah verbum hoc in terra' significat quod hoc illis in perpetuum, quoad illa quae sunt veri et boni fidei Ecclesiae: `et fecit Jehovah verbum hoc a crastino' 
significat effectum secundum praefinitionem: `et moriebatur omne pecus Aegyptiorum' significat consumptionem veri et boni fidei apud illos qui infestant: `et de pecore filiorum Israelis non moriebatur 
unum' significat quod nihil fidei consumeretur apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et misit Pharao, et ecce non mortuum de pecore Israelis usque ad unum' significat quod id notum factum sit illis 
qui infestant: `et aggravatum cor Pharaonis' significat obstinationem: `et non dimisit populum' significat quod non relinquerent illos. 	@1 cp n. 7499$ 	@2 quod$ </p>
