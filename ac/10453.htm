<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10453节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10453</strong>.“版是神的工作，字是神写的，刻在版上”表圣言的外在意义和内在意义来自神性，是神性真理。这从“版”、“神的工作”、“写”和“刻在版上”的含义清楚可知：“版”是指整体上的圣言，如刚才所述（<a href="10452.htm">10452</a>节），但在此是指圣言的外在形式，如下文所述；“神的工作”是指它来自神性；“写”是指圣言的内在形式，如下文所述，因此“神写的”是指来自神性的圣言的内在形式，因而是指神性真理；“刻在版上”是指内在被铭刻在外在上，因而被包含在外在里面。<br />“版”在此之所以表示圣言的外在形式，是因为它们在此区别于文字，也就是它的内在；但当与文字没有区别时，它们就表示圣言的内在和外在形式，因而表示整体上的圣言，如前所述（<a href="10452.htm">10452</a>节）。它们在此之所以是有区别的，是因为这两块石版被摔碎了；不过，后来这些字又被耶和华刻在摩西所凿的另两块石版上。圣言的外在形式就是它的字义，内在形式则是它的内义。前者，就是字义由“（石）版”来表示；因为字义就像内义能刻写于其上的一块石版或一个层面。<br />摩西看见牛犊和跳舞时摔碎的那两块石版是神的工作，按照耶和华的吩咐，摩西另凿出两块石版，然后这些字又刻写在它们上面；因此，这两块石版不再是神的工作，而是摩西的工作，但文字仍是神写的；这一切含有一个至今不为人知的奥秘。这奥秘就是：如果圣言是在别的人民当中写的，或者如果以色列人民不是这种秉性，圣言的字义就不同了。圣言的字义都是论述以色列人民的，因为圣言是在他们当中写成的，这从圣言的历史部分和先知书部分明显看出来。他们是深陷邪恶的人民，因为他们心里崇拜偶像；然而，为使得内在意义与外在意义能够一致，这个人民不得不被高度赞扬，被称为神的子民，一个神圣的民族，一个特别的珍宝。因此，通过圣言的外在意义接受教导的简单人会以为这个民族就如同它被称呼的样子；这个民族本身也相信这一点，事实上，就连如今基督教界的大多数人都相信。此外，呈现在圣言外在意义中并构成这外在意义的许多事都是由于他们心硬而被允许的事，如马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.8.htm">19:8</a>）中所提到的那些事，以及不需要在此提及的其它事。<br />因此，由于圣言的字义因着这人民的秉性而变成这样，所以系神工作的那两块石版被摔碎了，按照耶和华的吩咐，摩西另外凿出了两块。但由于它们仍拥有同样的神圣和神性的内容在里面，所以耶和华将写在前两块石版上的文字又写在了后两块石版上，这一点从以下摩西五经中的经文明显看出来，出埃及记：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你要凿出两块石版，和先前的一样，我要将你所摔碎那先前的版上面的字写在这版上。耶和华将这约的话，就是十句话，写在这些版上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.1.htm">34:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28.htm">28</a>）<br />申命记：<br />那时，耶和华对我说，你要凿出两块石版，和先前的一样，你所摔碎那先前的版上面的话我要写在版上。耶和华就照先前所写的，就是十句话，写在这版上。后来耶和华将版交给我了。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />耶和华并不承认这人民是祂自己的百姓（尽管为了内在意义能与外在意义一致，他们被如此称呼），而是承认他们是摩西的百姓，这一事实从本章清楚看出来：<br />你的百姓，就是你从埃及地领上来的，已经败坏了自己。现在，去吧！你领这百姓往我所告诉你的地方去。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.7.htm">32:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.34.htm">34</a>）<br /><br />耶和华对摩西讲说，你和你从埃及地所领上来的百姓，上到我曾起誓应许亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地去。我要差遣使者在你前面，我不在你们中间上去，因为你们是硬着颈项的百姓。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.1.htm">33:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.3.htm">3</a>）<br />摩西被放在磐石穴中，没有被允许见耶和华的面，只见到祂的背（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.22.htm">33:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.23.htm">23</a>）所表相同。当摩西面皮发光，每每与以色列说话都要用帕子蒙上脸时的摩西（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.30.htm">34:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.35.htm">35</a>）也所表相同。当亚伯兰想叫他的种得迦南地为业时，耶和华就向他预言了这个人民将是何品质，经上说：<br />亚伯兰把用来立约的一头三岁母牛犊，一只三岁母山羊和一只三岁公绵羊从中间劈成两半后，亚伯兰沉睡了，看哪，有可怕的大黑暗落在他身上。日落时，天幽暗；看哪，有冒烟的炉和烧着的火把从那些肉块中经过。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.9.htm">15:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.17.htm">17</a>）</p>

And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. That this signifies that the external and the internal sense of the Word were from the Divine, and 
are Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "the tables," as being the Word in the whole complex (of which just above, n. 10452), but here the external of the Word (of which in what follows); 
from the signification of "the work of God," as being that it was from the Divine; from the signification of "the writing," as being the internal of the Word (of which also below), consequently "the 
writing of God," denotes the internal of the Word from the Divine; and from the signification of "graven upon the tables," as being the internal above the external, thus within it. [2] That "the tables" 
here signify the external of the Word, is because they are here distinguished from the writing, which denotes its internal. But when they are not distinguished from the writing, then by "the tables" 
is signified the internal and the external of the Word together, thus the Word in the whole complex (as above, n. 10452). The reason why they are here distinguished, is that the tables were broken, 
and yet the same words were afterward written by Jehovah upon other tables which were hewn out by Moses. The external of the Word is the sense of its letter. This sense of the letter is signified 
by "the tables" because this sense is like a table, or a plane, upon which the internal sense has been written. [3] That the tables which were the work of God were broken by Moses when he saw the calf 
and the dances, and that by command of Jehovah other tables were hewn out by Moses, and on these were afterward written the same words, and thus that the tables were no longer the work of God, but the 
work of Moses, whereas the writing was still the writing of God, involves a secret as yet unknown. The secret is that the sense of the letter of the Word would have been different if the Word had been 
written among a different people, or if that people had not been such as it was. For the sense of the letter of the Word treats of that people, because the Word was written among them, as is plain 
from both the historic and the prophetic parts of the Word, and that people was in evil, because at heart it was idolatrous; and yet in order that the internal and the external sense might agree together, 
that people had to be lauded, and to be called the people of God, a holy nation, a peculiar possession; consequently the simple, who were to be instructed by the external sense of the Word, had 
to believe that that nation was such as it is called; as also that nation itself believes, and as also believe very many of the Christian world at this day. Moreover, also many things are present in the 
external sense of the Word, and make it, that were permitted them on account of the hardness of their hearts, such as those mentioned in Matthew 19:8, and other things also which are here passed by. 
 [4] As therefore the sense of the letter of the Word was made such for the sake of that people, therefore those tables which were the work of God were broken, and at the command of Jehovah others 
were hewn out by Moses. But whereas the same Divine holiness was still within, therefore the same words which had been written upon the former tables were written by Jehovah on the latter, as is plain 
from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, that I may write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou broke. 
And Jehovah wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words (Exod. 34:1, 4, 28).      At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and I will write 
on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou broke. And Jehovah wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten words, and Jehovah gave them unto me (Deut. 10:1-4). [5] 
That Jehovah did not acknowledge that people as His own people (although it was so said for the sake of the agreement of the internal sense with the external), but as the people of Moses, is evident 
in these passages: </p>
<p>     Thy people have corrupted themselves, which thou madest to come up out of the land of Egypt. Go, lead the people unto the place I told thee (Exod. 32:7, 34).      Jehovah 
spoke unto Moses, Go up, thou and the people which thou hast made to come up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And I will send an angel 
before thee; for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people (Exod. 33:1-3).      [6] The like is signified by Moses being put in a cleft of the rock, and not being allowed 
to see the faces of Jehovah, but only the back parts (Exod. 33:22, 23); and in like manner by Moses, when the skin of his face shone, putting a veil over his face when he spoke to the sons of Israel 
(Exod. 34:30-35). What the quality of that people was to be, is foretold by Jehovah to Abraham, when it was His will that his seed should inherit the land of Canaan, and it is said: </p>
<p>     After Abraham 
had divided a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, in the midst, which were for entering into a covenant, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham, and 
behold a terror of great darkness falling upon him. And when the sun was set, there was thick darkness; and behold a furnace of smoke, and a torch of fire that passed between those pieces (Gen. 15:9, 
10, 12, 17). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10453</b></p><p><b>10453.</b>
'And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets' means the outward sense of the Word and the inward - which come from the Divine - and Divine Truth. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'the tablets' as the Word in its entirety, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10452.htm">10452</a>, but at this point the outward form of the Word, dealt with below; from the meaning 
of 'the work of God' as its coming from the Divine; from the meaning of 'the writing' as the inward form of the Word, also dealt with below, so that 'the writing of God' is the inward form of the 
Word coming from the Divine, and thus is Divine Truth; and from the meaning of 'engraved on the tablets' as the inward impressed on and so contained within the outward.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why the tablets 
here mean the outward form of the Word is that they are distinguished here from the writing, which is its inward form; but when they are not distinguished from the writing they mean the inward and 
the outward forms of the Word together, thus the Word in its entirety, as above in <a href="10452.htm">10452</a>. They are distinguished here because these tablets were broken, but nevertheless the same words were afterwards 
inscribed by Jehovah on the other tablets which were hewn by Moses. The outward form of the Word is its literal sense, the inward form is its internal sense. The former - the literal sense - is meant 
by 'the tablets', because this sense is like a tablet or level surface on which the internal sense is inscribed.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The breaking by Moses of the tablets which were the work of God, when he saw 
the calf and the dances, and the hewing by Moses, as commanded by Jehovah, of other tablets, which then had the same words inscribed on them (so that the tablets were no longer the work of God but the 
work of Moses, though the writing was still the writing of God), hold an arcanum unknown up to now. The arcanum is that the literal sense of the Word would have been different if the Word had been written 
among another people, or if the character of the Israelite people had not been such as it was. For the literal sense of the Word is all about that people since the Word was written among them, as 
is evident from both the historical sections and the prophetical parts of the Word. They were a people steeped in evil because they were idolatrous at heart; yet in order that the internal sense and 
the external sense might be in agreement that people had to be highly acclaimed, and to be called God's people, a holy nation, and a peculiar treasure. Consequently the simple, who would be taught by 
means of the outward sense of the Word, would believe that that nation was all those things, as that nation itself also believes, and indeed as the majority in the Christian world do at the present day. 
Most of the things furthermore that present themselves in and constitute the outward sense of the Word were ones that were permitted on account of their hardness of heart, such as those referred to 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:8</a> and also others which need not be mentioned here.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since therefore the literal sense of the Word came to be what it was because of what those people were like, the tablets which 
were the work of God were broken and others, as commanded by Jehovah, were hewn by Moses. But since they nevertheless had the same holy and Divine content within them the same words as were on the first 
tablets were inscribed by Jehovah on them, as is evident from the following verses in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write 
on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke. And Jehovah wrote on those tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:1,4,28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:1,4,28</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere,  </p>
<blockquote>
At that time 
Jehovah said to me, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke. And Jehovah wrote on the tablets 
according to the first writing, the Ten Words. Afterwards Jehovah gave them to me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:1-4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The fact that Jehovah did not acknowledge that people as His own people - even though they 
were called such so that the inward sense would accord with the outward - but as Moses' people is clear from the present chapter,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your people have corrupted themselves, whom you caused to come up 
out of the land of Egypt. Go! lead the people to what I have spoken of to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:7,34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:7,34</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And further on,  </p>
<blockquote>
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go up, you and the people whom you have caused to come 
up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And I will send an angel before you, for I will not go up in your midst because you<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> are a stiff-necked people. 
Exod. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=3%203:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">3 3:1-3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The like is meant by Moses' being put in the hole of the rock, and his not being allowed to see Jehovah's face, but only His back parts, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2033:22,23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 33:22,23</a>. The like is also meant, 
when the skin on Moses' face shone, by his putting a veil onto his face whenever he talked to the children of Israel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:30-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:30-35</a>. What the character of that people would be is foretold by Jehovah 
to Abram, when he wanted his seed to inherit the land of Canaan, where it is stated that after Abram had parted down the middle the three year old heifer, the three year old she-goat, and the three 
year old ram, which served for entering into a covenant,  </p>
<blockquote>
A deep sleep came over Abram, and behold, a dread of a great darkness was coming over him. And when the sun went down there was thick darkness, 
and behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:8,9,12,17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:8,9,12,17</a>.

`Et tabulae opus Dei illae, et scriptura scriptura Dei illa, excisa super tabulis': quod significet sensum Verbi externum et Internum ex Divino, ac Divinum Verum, constat ex significatione  `tabularum' 
quod sint Verbum in toto complexu, de qua mox supra n.  10,452; hic autem externum Verbi, de qua re in sequentibus; ex significatione `operis Dei' quod sit a Divino; ex significatione `scripturae' 
quod sit internum Verbi, de qua etiam sequitur; {1}inde `scriptura Dei' est internum Verbi a Divino; et ex significatione `excisa super tabulis' quod sit internum super externo, ita in illo. 	[2] Quod 
`tabulae' hic significent externum Verbi, est quia distinguuntur illae hic a scriptura, quae est internum ejus; cum autem non distinguuntur a scriptura, tunc per illas significatur {2} Verbi internum 
et externum simul, ita Verbum in toto complexu, ut supra n. 10,452; quod hic distinguantur, est quia tabulae fractae sunt, et usque eadem {3}verba postea aliis tabulis quae a Mosche dolatae sunt, a 
Jehovah {4}inscribebantur. Externum Verbi est sensus litterae ejus, internum ejus est sensus internus ejus; ille sensus, nempe sensus litterae, significatur per `tabulas,' quia ille sensus est sicut 
tabula, seu sicut planum, cui sensus internus inscriptus est. 	[3] Quod tabulae, quae opus Dei, a Mosche cum vidit vitulum et choreas, fractae fuerint, et quod ex mandato Jehovae, aliae tabulae a Mosche 
dolatae sint, ac iis inscripta {5}dein eadem verba, et sic quod tabulae non amplius essent opus Dei sed opus Moschis, at scriptura usque scriptura Dei, involvit arcanum quod adhuc ignotum est; arcanum 
est quod sensus litterae Verbi alius fuisset si Verbum apud alium populum conscriptum fuisset, aut si hic populus non talis fuisset, sensus enim litterae Verbi agit de illo populo, {6}quia Verbum 
apud illum conscriptum est, ut patet tam ab historicis quam a propheticis Verbi, et populus ille in malo fuit, quia corde idololatricus, et tamen ut sensus internus (c)et externus congruerent, laudandus 
erat is populus, et vocandus populus Dei, gens sancta, peculium; inde simplices, qui erudirentur per sensum externum Verbi, credituri essent quod gens illa illis {7}fuerit, sicut etiam ipsa illa gens 
credit, et quoque plerique ex orbe Christiano hodie; (m) (c)ac praeterea plura ob duritiem cordis eorum illis permissa fuerunt, quae exstant in sensu externo Verbi, et faciunt illum, ut quae Matth. 
xix 8, {8}et quoque alia quae hic (x)praetereuntur; [4](n) cum itaque sensus litterae Verbi propter illum populum talis factus est, ideo tabulae illae quae fuerunt opus Dei, fractae sunt, et aliae, 
ex mandato Jehovae, a Mosche dolatae sunt; sed quia usque idem sanctum Divinum intus inerat, ideo eadem verba quae fuerunt in prioribus, a Jehovah illis {9}inscripta sunt, ut patet ex his apud Moschen, 
 	Dixit (x)Jehovah ad Moschen, Dola tibi duas tabulas lapidum sicut priores, {10}et scribam super tabulis verba quae fuerunt super tabulis prioribus quas fregisti: et scripsit Jehovah super tabulis 
illis verba foederis, decem verba, Exod. xxxiv 1, 4, 28:  et alibi, 	In tempore illo dixit Jehovah ad me, Dola tibi duas tabulas lapidum sicut priores, et scribam super tabulis verba quae fuerunt super 
tabulis prioribus quas fregisti; et scripsit Jehovah super tabulis juxta scripturam priorem, decem verba; post dedit eas Jehovah mihi, Deut. x 1-4. 	[5] Quod Jehovah non agnoverit illum populum 
pro Suo populo,   tametsi ita ob concordantiam sensus interni cum externo, dictus fuerit, {11}sed pro populo Moschis, constat in hoc capite, 	Corrupit se populus tuus, quem ascendere fecisti e terra 
Aegypti; vade, duc populum, ad quod dixi tibi, vers. 7, 34: </p>
<p>et porro, 	Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, Ascende tu et populus quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti, in terram quam juravi Abrahamo, 
Jischako, et Jacobo, et mittam ante te angelum, quoniam non ascendam in medio tui, eo quod populus durus cervice ille, Exod. xxxiii 1-3. 	[6]Simile significatur per quod Moscheh positus fuerit in foramine
