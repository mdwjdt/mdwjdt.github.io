<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5051.</strong>我在宁静的梦中看见几棵树栽在一个木制容器里，其中一棵高，一棵矮，两棵小。那棵矮树给予我极大的快乐，一种我无法言表的极度愉悦的平安感充满我的内心。一觉醒来，我与那些引发这梦的人交谈。他们都是天使灵（参看<a href="1977.htm">1977</a>，<a href="1979.htm">1979</a>节）；他们告诉我，我所看到的都表示什么，即表示婚姻之爱，其中：高树表示丈夫，矮树表示妻子，两棵小树表示孩子。他们还告诉我，充满我内心的极度愉悦的平安感用来表明那些在来世过着真正婚姻之爱生活的人所享有的平安的愉悦。他们补充说，像这样的人就是那些属于膝盖以上的大腿区域的人，而那些状态还要愉悦的人则属于两腰区域。我还被指示，该区域通过脚与脚底并脚跟交流。这种交流的存在还可从大腿的大神经明显看出来，这条大神经所发出的分支不仅通过腰进入生殖部位，也就是婚姻之爱的器官，还通过脚进入脚底和脚跟。当时，这些天使灵还向我透露，在圣言中，当雅各与天使摔跤时，扭了的大腿窝和筋是什么意思（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.25.htm">32:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创32.32.htm">32</a>；参看<w1>4280<w2>4280<w3>，<w1>4281<w2>4281<w3>，<w1>4314<w2>4314<w3>-<w1>4317<w2>4317<w3>节）。<br />此后，我看见一只大狗，就像被古作家称为冥府守门狗的那种，它张开可怕的嘴巴。我被告知，像这样的狗表示防止人从天堂的婚姻之爱逾越到地狱的奸淫之爱的守卫。因为天堂的婚姻之爱就在于一个人与他极其温柔爱着的妻子，以及他的孩子过着在主里面满足的生活。在世上，这爱带给他深深的愉悦，在来世则带给他天堂的喜乐。但是，如果他从这爱逾越到它的对立面，并且这对立的爱在他看来似乎含有天堂的快乐在里面，尽管它是地狱的快乐，那么类似冥府守门狗的狗就表现为一个守卫，防止这两种对立的快乐之间有任何交流。</p>

In a quiet dream I saw some trees planted in a wooden receptacle, one of which was tall, another lower, and two were small. The lower tree delighted me very greatly, and all the while a very pleasant 
rest, such as I cannot express, affected my mind. On awaking from sleep I conversed with those who induced the dream. They were angelic spirits (see n. 1977, 1979), and they told me what was signified 
by what I had seen-that it was conjugial love, the tall tree signifying the husband, the lower tree the wife, and the two small ones the children. They told me further that the very pleasant rest which 
affected my mind indicated what pleasantness of peace those have in the other life who have lived in genuine conjugial love. They added that such are those who belong to the province of the thighs 
next above the knees, and that those who are in a still more pleasant state belong to the province of the loins. It was also shown that this province communicates through the feet with the soles and 
the heels. That this is so, is plain from that great nerve in the thigh which sends forth its branches not only through the loins to the members of generation (which are the organs of conjugial love), 
but also through the feet to the soles and the heels. It was also then discovered what is meant in the Word by the hollow and the nerve of the thigh which was put out of joint in Jacob, when he wrestled 
with the angel (Gen. 32:25, 31, 32; see n. 4280, 4281, 4314-4317). [2] I afterward saw a great dog, such as that called Cerberus by ancient writers, with a frightful open mouth; and I was told that 
such a dog signifies a guard to prevent man's passing over from heavenly conjugial love to the love of adultery, which is infernal; for heavenly conjugial love exists when a man together with his wife, 
whom he loves most tenderly, and with his children, lives content in the Lord. From this he has in this world an inward pleasantness, and in the other life heavenly joy; but when he passes from this 
love into the opposite, and finds in this a delight that seems to him heavenly, although it is infernal, then such a dog is presented as a guard lest there should be a communication between these 
opposite delights. </p>

In a peaceful dream I once saw some trees planted in a wooden receptacle, one of which was tall, another shorter, and two were small. The shorter tree gave me very great delight, and all the while a 
very lovely feeling of peacefulness, beyond my ability to describe, was filling my mind. When I woke up from my sleep I talked to those among whom my dream had originated. They were angelic spirits, see <a href="1977.htm">1977</a>, <a href="1979.htm">1979</a>. Who told me what was meant by that sight - conjugial love. The tall tree meant a husband, the shorter his wife, and the two small ones their children. Those angelic spirits went on to say 
that the very lovely feeling of peacefulness which filled my mind served to indicate the loveliness of the peace enjoyed by those in the next life who have led lives of genuine conjugial love. They 
added that people like these are the ones who belong to the province of the thighs immediately above the knees, and that those whose state is yet more lovely belong to the province of the loins. I was 
also shown that this province communicates through the feet with the soles and heels. The existence of this communication is also evident from the large nerve in the thigh which sends out its branches 
not only through the loins to the generative parts, which are the organs of conjugial love, but also through the feet to the soles and heels. Those angelic spirits also disclosed to me at this time 
the meaning in the Word of the acetabulum and the nerve in the thigh which was put out of joint when Jacob wrestled with the angel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2032:25,%2031,%2032,%20de&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 32:25, 31, 32, de</a>alt with in <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>-<a href="4317.htm">4317</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 After 
this I saw a large dog, like the one which very ancient authors call Cerberus. It had horrible, gaping jaws. I was told that a dog such as this means the guard which is set to prevent a person crossing 
over from heavenly conjugial love to a love of adultery, which is a hellish love. For heavenly conjugial love consists in one living, content in the Lord, together with one's partner whom one loves 
very tenderly, and with one's children. In the world this brings a person a deeper pleasure, and in the next life heavenly joy. But if people cross over from that love to its opposite, and this opposite 
love seems to them to hold heavenly delight within it, though in fact it is a hellish delight, a dog resembling Cerberus presents itself as if on guard to prevent any communication of opposite delights. </p>

In somnio quieto vidi aliquot arbores in receptaculo ligneo plantatas, quarum una erat procera, altera humilior, et binae parvae; delectabat me maxime humilior illa arbor; ac interea amoenissima quies 
quam effari nequeam, afficiebat {1} mentem; </p>
<p>excitatus e somno, loquebar cum illis qui inducebant somnium; erant spiritus angelici, videatur n. 1977, 1979, qui dicebant quid per visum illud significabatur, 
quod nempe amor conjugialis, per `arborem proceram' maritus, per `humiliorem' uxor, {2} per `binas parvas' liberi; dicebant porro quod amoenissima quies quae {1} afficiebat mentem, indicaret 
qualis amoenitas pacis illis est in altera vita qui in amore conjugiali genuino vixerunt; addebant quod tales sint qui pertinent ad provinciam femorum proxime super genua, et quod qui in amoeniore 
adhuc statu sunt, pertineant ad provinciam lumborum: ostendebatur etiam quod communicatio intercedat per pede cum plantis et calcaneis {3}; quod communicatio sit, etiam patet a magno illi nervo 
in femore qui ramos suos emittit, non modo per lumbos ad membra generationi dicata quae Sunt organa amoris conjugialis, sed etiam per pede ad plantas et ad calcaneos; </p>
<p>detegebatur etiam tunc quid 
in Verbo intellectum est per (o)acetabulum et nervum femoris qui luxatus est Jacobo cum luctaretur cum angelo, Gen. xxxii 26, 32, 33 [A.V. 25,31,32]; de quo n. 4280, 4281, 4314-4317.  [2] Videbatur 
mihi dein magnus canis, qualis is qui Cerberus apud antiquissimos scriptores vocatur; erat dictum horrendo; dictum quod talis canis significet custodiam ne homo ab amore conjugiali caelesti ad amorem 
adulterii qui est infernalis, transcendat; amor enim conjugialis caelestis est cum homo cum conjuge sua quam tenerrime amat et cum liberis contentus in Domino vivit, inde ei in mundo interius 
amoenum (o)est, et in altera vita caeleste gaudium; cum autem ab illo amore transitur in oppositum, et in eo apparet illis jucundum quasi caeleste, et tamen est infernale, tunc talis canis sistitur 
quasi custodiens ne jucunditates oppositae communicent. </p>
