<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第538节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>538.</strong>有些灵连天堂是什么都不知道，却试图进入天堂。他们被告知，除非拥有爱之信，否则进天堂就象投入烈火一样危险。但他们仍竭尽全力寻求它。他们刚抵达天堂的入口处，也就是说，进入天使灵的低层区域，就受到猛烈击打，以至于猛地退后。以此方式向他们表明，在被主预备好接受信的情感之前，仅是靠近天堂就有多么大的危险。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]538.</strong> Another group with no idea what heaven is like was also making an effort to get in. They were told that unless they possessed a faith inspired by love, entering heaven was as dangerous as walking through fire; but they still insisted. On reaching the "front entryway" — the lower realm of angelic spirits — they received such a blow that they went tearing off in the opposite direction as fast as they could go. From this they learned how much danger there was in merely approaching heaven before the Lord had prepared them to feel the emotions that come with faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 538</b></p><p><b>538.</b>
There were some who sought admission into heaven without knowing what heaven is. They were told that unless they were in the faith of love, to enter heaven would be as dangerous as going into a flame; 
but still they sought for it. When they arrived at the first entrance court, that is to say, the lower sphere of angelic spirits, they were smitten so hard that they threw themselves headlong back, 
and in this way were taught how dangerous it is merely to approach heaven until prepared by the Lord to receive the affections of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 538</b></p><p><b>538.</b>
There were also some who were striving to get into heaven without knowing what heaven was. They were told that if they did not possess the faith that inheres in love, entering heaven was as dangerous 
as walking into a blazing fire. But they went on doing all they could to get there. When they reached its most outlying area however, that is, that lower sphere of angelic spirits, they found it so overpowering 
that they flung themselves back in the opposite direction. In this way they were shown how dangerous it was merely to approach heaven before they had been prepared by the Lord to receive the 
affections that accompany faith.  </p>

</p><b>538.</b>
Quidam etiam ambiebant in caelum, nescientes quid caelum, quibus dictum quod tam periculosum sit venire in caelum nisi sint in fide amoris, sicut in flammam; sed usque ambiebant: cum venerunt ad primum 
atrium seu in sphaeram interiorem spirituum angelicorum, ita perculsi sunt ut se praecipites retro conjicerent; inde instructi quantum periculi sit modo approximare ad caelum antequam praeparati sunt 
a Domino recipiendi fidei affectiones. </p>
