<p><strong>[NCE]501.</strong> The churches succeeding one another over time, each described as giving birth to the next, operated much as fruits do, or as their seeds do. The fruit within the fruit or seed within the seed, so to speak, is at the center, deep inside, and each layer of fruit or seed receives life from the layer before it in order. The farther out you go toward the surface, the less there is of the fruit's or the seed's essence, until finally there is only a skin or covering where the fruit or seed ends.<br />The brain follows the same pattern. Inside it is a fine organic network called the cortical substances. These substances provide a starting point and medium for the soul's operations. Following in order from them come fine coverings, then denser ones, and at last the ones that overlie all of the brain, called meninges. These are bounded by even more inclusive layers and in the end by the one that envelops the whole, which is the skull.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg has no difficulty here comparing the tissue layers surrounding a seed in a fruiting body with the brain and its meninges. The underlying rationale for this comparison is the contiguum concept appearing early in his scientific period and coming to maturity in his theological works. According to this concept, such layers are derived successively one from another in a causal series, each layer being a little less perfect than the one before. They are related — but not equivalent — structures. This anatomical principle appears in the theological works as the principle of distinct levels (traditionally rendered "discrete degrees"), which is necessary, along with the principle of correspondence, for describing how the divine order devolves from spiritual to physical levels in a step-by-step process.

As regards the churches that in course of time succeeded one another, and of which it is said that one was born from another, the case with them was the same as it is with fruits, or with their seeds. 
In the midst of these, that is, in their inmosts, there are as it were fruits of the fruits, or seeds of the seeds, from which live as it were in regular order the successive parts. For the more remote 
these are from the inmost toward the circumference, the less of the essence of the fruit or of the seed is there in them, until finally they are but the cuticles or coverings in which the fruits or 
seeds terminate. Or as in the case of the brain, in the inmost parts of which are subtle organic forms called the cortical substances, from which and by which the operations of the soul proceed; and 
from which in regular order the purer coverings follow in succession, then the denser ones, and finally the general coverings called meninges, which are terminated in coverings still more general, and 
at last in the most general of all, which is the skull. </p>

The succession of Churches in the course of time, and how, as is said, they were born one from another, resembles fruit or the seeds within fruit. in their centre or inmost parts there are, so to speak, 
the fruit of the fruit, or seeds of the seeds, from which there live so to speak in order the surrounding parts which develop at later stages. For the further those areas are from the middle towards 
the outermost parts the less are they essentially fruit or seed, until at length the skin or shell is reached where the fruit or seeds terminate. Or as with the brain, in the innermost areas there 
are delicate parts of its organic structure known as the cortical substances, from which and through which the soul functions. From these cortical substances finer coverings proceed in proper order, then 
those that are coarser. After that there are general coverings called meninges, and more general ones outside of these until the one on the very outside, which is the skull, is reached.  </p>

Ecclesiae temporum tractu sibi succedentes, et quarum una ab altera dicitur nata, se habuerunt sicut se habet cum fructibus aut cum eorum seminibus, quod in medio illorum seu in intimis sint fructuum 
quasi fructus, seu seminum quasi semina, ex quibus vivunt quasi ordine succedentia; nam quo remotius inde versus peripherias, eo minus essentiae fructus aut seminis, usque tandem ut sint modo cuticulae 
seu involucra, in quae fructus aut semina desinunt. Aut sicut in cerebro, in cujus intimis sunt subtilia organica, substantiae corticales dicta, ex quibus et per quae animae operationes procedunt; 
ex quibus ordine succedunt puriora involucra, tum densiora, tandem communia quae vocantur meninges, quae terminantur in adhuc communioribus et tandem in communissimo quod est cranium. </p>
