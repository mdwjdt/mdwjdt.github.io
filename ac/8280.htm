Verses 6-10. The right hand, O Jehovah, is magnified in strength; with Thy right hand, O Jehovah, Thou breakest in pieces the enemy. And in the multitude of Thine excellency Thou destroyest those who 
are rising up against Thee; Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it devoureth them as stubble. And with the wind of Thy nostrils the waters were heaped up, the floods stood as a heap; the abysses were congealed 
in the heart of the sea. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be filled with them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall drive them out. Thou didst 
blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sought the deep like lead in the vast waters. "Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is magnified in strength," signifies the Lord's omnipotence shown; "with Thy right 
hand, O Jehovah, Thou breakest in pieces the enemy," signifies the effect of omnipotence on evils and the derivative falsities, the power of which is being annihilated; "and in the multitude of Thine 
excellency Thou destroyest those who rise up against Thee," signifies that by virtue of the Divine, things opposed are rejected as nothing; "Thou sendest forth Thy wrath," signifies the fury of cupidities, 
and the endeavor to inflict violence, with the evil; "it devoureth them as stubble," signifies the consequent devastation and damnation from themselves; "and with the wind of Thy nostrils the 
waters were heaped up," signifies that falsities were gathered together into a one through the presence of heaven; "the floods stood as a heap," signifies that those who are continually attempting 
evil could not in the least infest; "the abysses were congealed in the heart of the sea," signifies that mere falsities from the evil of the cupidities of the love of self could not possibly emerge; "the 
enemy said," signifies the thought of those who were in evils and the derivative falsities before the coming of the Lord; "I will pursue," signifies infestation; "I will overtake," signifies subjugation; 
"I will divide the spoil," signifies servitude; "my soul shall be filled with them," signifies delight; "I will draw my sword," signifies the continual combat of falsity from evil; "my hand shall 
drive them out," signifies that by virtue of power, heaven shall be destroyed; "Thou didst blow with Thy wind," signifies the presence of the Lord with the angels; "the sea covered them," signifies 
that all falsity enveloped them; "they sought the deep like lead," signifies that evils dragged them down to lower things, like weights in the world; "in the vast waters" signifies an environment by 
a boundless abundance of falsities. </p>

Verses 6-10 Your right hand, O Jehovah, has been magnified in strength; with Your right hand, O Jehovah, You break the enemy in pieces. And in the greatness of Your excellence You destroy those rising 
up against You; You send out Your wrath, it eats them up like stubble. And with the wind of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up, the floods stood as a heap; the depths were congealed in the heart 
of the sea. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul will be filled with them. I will unsheathe my sword, my hand will drive them out. You blew with Your wind, 
the sea covered them over; they sought a deep place like lead in the mighty waters. 'Your right hand, O Jehovah, has been magnified in strength' means that the Lord's almighty power has been displayed. 
'With Your right hand, O Jehovah, You break the enemy in pieces' means the effect almighty power has on evils and resulting falsities, whose power is eliminated. 'And in the greatness of Your excellence 
You destroy those rising up against You' means that things opposed to the Divine are cast aside by Him as worthless. 'You send out Your wrath' means the furious desires of the evil and their attempt 
to do violence. 'It eats them up like stubble' means consequent devastation and damnation, for which they themselves are responsible. 'And with the wind of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up' 
means falsities gathered together through heaven's presence. 'The floods stood as a heap' means that those constantly attempting what was evil could not engage in any molestation whatever. 'The depths 
were congealed in the heart of the sea' means that utter falsities arising from evil belonging to the desires of self-love could not rise to the surface. 'The enemy said' means the thought of those 
ruled by evils and the falsities arising from them, before the Lord's Coming. 'I will pursue' means molestation. 'I will overtake' means placing in subjection. 'I will divide the spoil' means servitude. 
'My soul will be filled' means delight. 'I will unsheathe the sword' means unceasing conflict on the part of falsity arising from evil. 'My hand will drive them out' means that by its power heaven 
will be destroyed. 'You blew with Your wind' means the Lord's presence with the angels. 'The sea covered them over' means that all the falsity they possessed hemmed them in. 'They sought a deep place 
like lead' means that evils drew them down to lower levels like heavy objects in the world. 'In the mighty waters' means surrounded by a vast quantity of falsities. </p>

Vers. 6-10.  Dextra Tua, Jehovah, magnificata in robore; dextra Tua, Jehovah, confringis hostem.  Et in multitudine excellentiae Tuae destruis insurgentes Tibi; emittis excandescentiam Tuam, comedit 
illos sicut stipulam.  Et vento narium Tuarum coacervatae sunt aquae, constiterunt sicut cumulus fluenta, coagulatae abyssi in corde maris.  Dixit hostis, Persequar, assequar, dividam spolium, implebitur 
illis anima mea, evacuabo gladium meum, expellet illos manus mea.  Spirasti vento Tuo, {1}contexit illos mare, profundum petierunt sicut plumbum in aquis ingentibus.  `Dextra Tua, Jehovah, magnificata 
in robore' significat omnipotentiam Domini ostensam: `dextra Tua, Jehovah, confringis hostem' significat omnipotentiae effectum in mala et inde falsa, quorum potentia annihilatur: `et in multitudine 
excellentiae Tuae destruis insurgentes Tibi' significat quod ex Divino opposita ut nihili rejiciantur: `emittis (x)excandescentiam Tuam' significat cupiditatum furorem et conatum violentiam inferendi 
apud malos: `comedit illos sicut stipulam' significat inde devastationem et damnationem ex seipsis: `et vento narium Tuarum coacervatae sunt aquae' significat falsa in anum collecta per praesentiam 
caeli: `constiterunt sicut cumulus fluenta' significat quod continue conantes malum ne hilum possent infestare: `congelatae abyssi in corde maris' significat quod merae falsitates ex malo cupiditatum 
amoris sui nequicquam possint emergere: `dixit hostis' significat cogitationem illorum qui in malis et inde falsis ante Domini Adventum: `Persequar' significat infestationem: `assequar' significat 
subjugationem: `dividam spolium' significat servitium: `implebitur anima mea' significat jucundum: `evacuabo gladium' significat pugnam falsi ex malo continuam: `expellet illos manus mea' significat quod 
ex potentia destruetur caelum: `spirasti vento (x)Tuo' significat praesentiam Domini cum angelis: `contexit illos mare' significat quod omne falsum quod illis obstipaverit: `profundum petierunt sicut 
plumbum' significat quod mala detraxerint illos ad inferiora sicut gravia in mundo: `in aquis ingentibus' significat circumfusionem a falsorum immensa copia. 	@1 contegit I$ </p>
