<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3104节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3104.</strong>“重半舍客勒”表引入所需的量。这从“舍客勒”、“半舍客勒”和“重”的含义清楚可知。“舍客勒”表良善与真理的价值或估价；“半舍客勒”表其确定的数量（参看<a href="2959.htm">2959</a>节）。很快我们就会看到，“重”表与良善相关的某种事物的状态。由此明显可知，“半舍客勒”表示并包含“金环”所表示的良善的数量。从上下文可推知，这数量就是引入所需要的量。<br />“重”是指与良善相关的某种事物的状态。这从以下圣言经文明显看出来。以西结书：<br />先知要按量吃食物：每日二十舍客勒；喝水也要按度：要喝一欣六分之一；看哪，我必在耶路撒冷折断他们的粮杖，他们吃饼要按量，忧虑而吃；喝水也要按度，惊惶而喝，使他们缺粮缺水。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.10.htm">4:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.17.htm">17</a>）<br />此处论述的是良善与真理的荒凉，这荒凉由“先知”来代表。良善荒凉的状态由他们“按量吃食物和饼”来表示；真理荒凉的状态由他们“按度喝水”来表示。“饼”表属天之物，因而表良善（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节）；“水”表属灵之物，因而表真理（参看<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>节）。由此明显可知，“量”（weight）论及良善，“度”（measure）论及真理。<br /><br />当有公道天平、公道伊法、公道罢特。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.10.htm">45:10</a>等）<br />这论及圣地，圣地表主的天国，这从先知此处提及的细节可以得知。那里不会有天平、伊法、罢特，只有这些量（weight）和度（measure）所表示的良善与真理。以赛亚书：<br />谁曾用手心量诸水，用手掌测苍天，用升斗盛大地的尘土，用秤称高山，用天平平冈陵呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.12.htm">40:12</a>）<br />“用秤称高山，用天平平冈陵”表这一真理：主是爱与仁的属天事物的源头，唯独祂整理这些事物的状态。这些称重所涉及的“高山”和“冈陵”表爱的属天之物（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>节）。<br />但以理书：<br />伯沙撒王宫墙上所写的文字是：弥尼，弥尼，提客勒，乌法珥新。解释是这样：弥尼，就是神已经数算你的国国，使它终止；提客勒，就是你被称在天平里，被发现亏欠；毗勒斯（与“乌法珥新”同义），就是你的国分裂，归与玛代人和波斯人。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.25.htm">5:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.28.htm">28</a>）<br />此处弥尼，或“已经数算”论及真理；而提客勒，或“称在天平里”论及良善。就内义而言，所论述的是时代即将终结的时候。</p>

Of half a shekel weight. That this signifies sufficient for initiation, is evident from the signification of a "shekel," a "half shekel," and "weight." That a "shekel" is the price or estimation of good 
and truth, and that a "half shekel" is the determination of its quantity, may be seen above (n. 2959). That "weight" signifies the state of a thing as to good will be seen presently; and thus it is 
evident that "of half a shekel weight" signifies and involves the quantity in respect to the good meant by the jewel of gold. That it is for initiation, follows from what precedes and follows. [2] 
That "weight" is the state of a thing as to good, is evident from the following passages of the Word. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The prophet was to eat food by weight, twenty shekels a day; and was to drink water 
by measure, the sixth part of a hin; for behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment, 
that they may want bread and water (Ezek. 4:10-11, 16-17). Here the vastation of good and of truth is treated of, a representation of which was made by the prophet. The state of vastated 
good is signified by their "eating food and bread by weight;" and the state of vastated truth by their "drinking water by measure" (that "bread" is the celestial, and thus is good, may be seen above, 
n. 276, 680, 1165, 2177; also that "water" is the spiritual, and thus is truth, n. 739, 2702, 3058); hence it is evident that "weight" is predicated of good, and "measure" of truth. [3] Again: </p>
<p>    
 There shall be balances of justice, and an ephah of justice, and a bath of justice (Ezek. 45:10, etc.). This is said of the holy land, by which is signified the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, as may 
be known from the several particulars there mentioned by the prophet; where there will be no balances, ephah, and bath, but goods and truths which are signified by these weights and measures. In Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and hath made ready the heavens with the palm of his hand, and hath comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains 
in scales, and the hills in a balance? (Isa. 40:12). To "weigh the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance," denotes that from the Lord are the celestial things of love and charity, 
and that He alone disposes their states. (That "mountains and hills," concerning which such weights are predicated, are the celestial things of love, may be seen above, n. 795, 796, 1430, 2722.)  [4] 
In Daniel: </p>
<p>     The writing upon the wall of the palace of Belshazzar was, Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. This is the interpretation: Mene, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it; Tekel, thou 
art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting; Peres, thy kingdom is divided and given to the Mede and the Persian (Dan. 5:25-28); </p>
<p>where mene or "hath numbered," is predicated of truth; while tekel 
or "weighed in the balances" is predicated of good; in the internal sense consummation is treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3104</b></p><p><b>3104.</b>
'Half a shekel in weight' means the amount needed for the introduction. This is clear from the meaning of 'a shekel', 'half a shekel', and 'weight'. 'A shekel' means the price or valuation of good and 
truth, and 'half a shekel' a defined amount of it, see <a href="2959.htm">2959</a>. 'Weight' means the state of something as regards good, as will be seen [below]. From these considerations it is evident that 'half a shekel 
in weight' means and embodies the amount as regards the good which 'a gold nose-jewel' is used to mean - that amount being the quantity of it that was needed for the introduction, as is plain from 
what comes before and after this point in the story. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'weight' is the state of something as regards good is evident from the following places in the Word: In Ezekiel where the prophet was told 
to eat food each day twenty shekels in weight, and to drink water in measure the sixth of a hin, </p>
<blockquote>
For, behold, I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, so that they may eat bread by weight 
and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and with dismay; that they may be in want of bread and water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%204:10,%2011,%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 4:10, 11, 16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the vastation of good and truth, which is represented 
by 'the prophet'. A state of good when vastated is meant by their having to eat food and bread 'by weight', and a state of truth when vastated by their having to drink water 'by measure' - 'bread' 
meaning that which is celestial, and so good, see <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, and 'water' that which is spiritual, and so truth, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>. From this it is evident that 'weight' is used in reference 
to good, and 'measure' to truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:10</a> 
</blockquote>
and following verses. </p>
<p>This refers to the holy land, by which 
the Lord's kingdom in heaven is meant, as may be recognized from every detail at this point in this prophet, where what are required are not balances, an ephah, and a bath that are just but the goods 
and truths meant by those weights and measures. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand and weighed the heavens in [His] palm, and gathered the dust of the earth in a 
measure, and weighed the mountains in a balance, and the hills in the scales? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Weighing the mountains in a balance and the hills in the scares' stands for the truth that the Lord is the 
source of the heavenly things of love and charity, and that He alone orders the states of these things. For 'the mountains' and 'the hills' referred to in connection with those weights mean the heavenly 
things of love, see <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The writing on the wall of Belshazzar's palace was, Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. This is the interpretation: Mene, God has numbered your 
kingdom and brought it to an end; Tekel, you have been weighed in the scales and have been found wanting; Peres, your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%205:25-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 5:25-28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'mene' or 'He has numbered' has reference to truth, but 'tekel' or 'weighed in the scales' to good. Described in the internal sense is the time when the age is drawing to a close. </p>

`Dimidium sicli pondus': quod significet quantum ad initiationem, constat a significatione `sicli, dimidii, et ponderis'; quod `siclus' sit pretium seu aestimatio boni et veri, et quod `dimidium sicli' 
sit determinatio quanti ejus, videatur n. 2959; quod `pondus' significet statum rei quoad bonum, videbitur; ex his patet quod `dimidium sicli pondus' significet et involvat quantum quoad bonum per 
`monile auri' intellectum; quod ad initiationem, sequitur ab illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur{1}. [2] Quod `pondus' sit status rei quoad bonum, patet ab his locis in Verbo: apud Ezechielem,  
         Propheta cibum comederet pondere viginti siclorum in       diem,...et aquam juxta mensuram biberet sextam hinis:...quia      ecce Ego frangens baculum panis in Hierosolyma, ut comedant    
  panem in pondere et in sollicitudine, et aquas in mensura et      cum stupore bibant, ut careant pane et aqua, iv [10, 11], 16,      17; </p>
<p>ubi de vastatione boni et veri, cujus repraesentatio per `prophetam,' 
status vastati boni significatur per quod `cibum et panem comederent in pondere,' et status vastati veri per quod `aquam juxta mensuram biberent,' quod `panis' sit caeleste, ita bonum, videatur 
n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, et quod `aqua' sit spirituale, {2}ita verum, n. 739, 2702, 3058; inde patet, quod `pondus' praedicetur de bono, et `mensura' de vero: [3] apud eundem,           Lances 
justitiae, ephah justitiae, et bath justitiae,       erit [vobis], xlv 10 seq.; </p>
<p>ibi de terra sancta, per quam quod regnum Domini in caelis significetur, ex singulis ibi apud Prophetam sciri potest, 
{3}ubi non lances, ephah, bath erunt, sed bona et vera, quae per pondera illa et per mensuras illas significantur: apud Esaiam,           Quis mensus in pugillo Suo aquas, et caelos palmo       paravit, 
et complexus in trientali pulverem terrae, et      appendit lance montes, et colles trutinis? xl 12; </p>
<p>`appendere lance montes et colles trutinis' pro quod a Domino caelestia amoris et charitatis, 
et quod solus disponat status eorum; quod `montes et colles,' de quibus praedicantur pondera illa, sint caelestia amoris, videatur n. 795, 796, 1430, 2722: [4] apud Danielem,           Scriptura super
