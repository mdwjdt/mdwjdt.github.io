<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10803节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10803</strong>.视法律在自己之上，因而视自己在法律之下的君主认为王权在于法律，法律管辖他。他知道，法律体现了公平与正义，一切真正的正义或公平都是神性。但视自己在法律之上，因而视法律在自己之下的君主认为王权在于他自己，要么认为自己就是法律，或他就是体现在法律中的正义的权威。结果，他硬将神性归于自己；而事实上，他必须在神性之下。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10803</b></p><p><b>10803.</b>
The king who regards the laws as above himself, and thus himself as beneath the laws, makes the royalty to consist in the law, and the law rules over him; for he knows that the law is justice, and all 
justice that is justice is Divine. But he who regards the laws as beneath him, and thus himself as above them, makes the royalty to consist in himself, and either believes himself to be the law, or 
the law which is justice to be from himself; consequently he arrogates to himself that which is Divine, and under which he must be. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10803</b></p><p><b>10803.</b>
The monarch who considers the laws to be superior to himself, and so himself to be subject to them, deems monarchy to reside in the law; and the law holds sway over him. He knows that the law embodies 
what is right and just and that all righteousness or justice which is truly such is Divine. But the one who considers the laws to be subject to himself, and so himself to be superior to them, deems 
monarchy to reside in himself and thinks either that he himself is the law or that he is the author of the justice embodied in it. As a result he arrogates to himself what is Divine, when yet he ought 
to be subject to it.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10803</b>
</p><b>10803.</b>
Rex qui spectat leges supra se, et sic se infra illas, is regium ponit in lege, et lex dominatur {1}super illum, scit enim quod lex sit justitia, et omnis justitia quae justitia est Divina; qui autem 
spectat leges infra se, et sic se supra illas, is regium ponit in se, et credit se vel esse legem, vel legem quae justitia esse a se, inde quod Divinum est sibi arrogat, sub quo tamen erit. @1 supra$ </p>
