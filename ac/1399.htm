<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1399节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1399.</strong>每个灵人都与内在，以及至内在的天堂进行交流，尽管他对此一无所知。因为没有这种交流，他便无法存活。处于其内在的天使知道自己的内在本性，主藉着这些天使掌管他。因此，其内在交流存在于天堂，就象其外在交流存在于灵人界那样。凭借内在交流，他适合于用或服务，他在不知不觉中被引入这用或服务中。世人也一样：他同样藉着天使与天堂交流，尽管他对此浑然不知，否则，他无法存活。从那里流入其思维的事物只不过是最终的结果。他的整个生命就源于此，其生命的一切努力也由此被掌管。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1399.</strong> All spirits have contact with the inner heaven and the inmost (although they are unaware of it); otherwise they could not live. Their inner nature is recognized by angels, who are awake to deeper dimensions, and the Lord also governs them through angels. So their inner characteristics become common knowledge in heaven, as their outer ones do in the world of spirits.<br />These inner communications adapt each of them for some useful role, and they are drawn to that role without realizing it.<br />The situation with people on earth is the same. We too communicate through angels with heaven 钬?in complete ignorance of the fact that we do 钬?because otherwise we could not live. (The influence heaven has on our thinking is merely the outermost effect of that interaction.) Such contact is the source of all our life, and it regulates everything we try to do in life. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1399</b></p><p><b>1399.</b>
Every spirit has communication with the interior and with the inmost heaven, though he is wholly ignorant of it, and without this communication he could not live. What he is inwardly, is known by the 
angels who are in his interiors, and he is also ruled by the Lord by means of these angels. Thus there are communications of his interiors in heaven, as there are of his exteriors in the world of spirits. 
By means of interior communications he is fitted for the use into which he is led without his being aware of it. The case is the same with man: he likewise communicates with heaven by means of angels-although 
of this he is wholly ignorant-for otherwise he could not live. The things which flow in therefrom into his thoughts, are only the ultimate effects; all his life is from this source, and 
from this are ruled all the endeavors [conatus] of his life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1399</b></p><p><b>1399.</b>
Every spirit has communication with the interior and with the inmost heaven, though he is totally unaware of it. Without it he could not live. His interior character is known by the angels who are in 
his interiors, and through whom also he is governed by the Lord. Thus communications of his interiors exist in heaven, just as those of his exteriors do in the world of spirits. By means of the interior 
communications he is fitted for the use into which he is led, without his being aware of it. So also with man, in that he too communicates with heaven by means of angels, though completely unaware 
of it, for without that communication he could not live. The things which flow in from there into his thoughts are no more than the ultimate effects. From this the whole of his life stems, and from this 
all the endeavours of his life are governed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1399</b>
</p><b>1399.</b>
Unusquisque spiritus communicationem habet cum interiore et intimo caelo, quod is prorsus nescit, alioquin non vivere posset; qualis est interius, noscitur ab angelis qui sunt in interioribus, et quoque 
per illos a Domino regitur; ita communicationes ejus interiorum dantur in caelo, sicut exteriorum in mundo spirituum: per interiores communicationes disponitur ad usum ad quem fertur, praeter quod 
sciat: ita quoque se habet cum homine; communicat quoque is per angelos cum caelo, quod prorsus nescit, nam alioquin vivere non posset; quae influunt inde in ejus cogitationes, sunt modo ultimi effectus; 
inde omnis ejus vita est, et inde omnes ejus vitae conatus reguntur. </p>
