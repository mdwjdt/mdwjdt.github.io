THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-8. And thou shalt make the altar of shittim wood, five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth; the altar shall be foursquare; and the height thereof shall be three 
cubits. And thou shalt make its horns upon the four corners thereof; from it shall be its horns; and thou shalt overlay it with brass. And thou shalt make its pans to take away its ashes, and its shovels, 
and its basins, and its fleshhooks, and its fire-tongs; all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. And thou shalt make for it a grating, a network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou 
make four rings of brass, upon the four extremities of it. And thou shalt bestow it under the compass of the altar beneath, and the net shall be even unto the middle of the altar. And thou shalt make 
staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and shalt overlay them with brass. And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in carrying 
it. Hollow of boards shalt thou make it; as thou wast made to see in the mountain, so shall they make it. "And thou shalt make the altar," signifies a representative of the Lord and of the worship of 
Him; "of shittim wood," signifies righteousness; "five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth," signifies equally from good and from truth; "the altar shall be foursquare," signifies thus what 
is righteous; "and the height thereof shall be three cubits," signifies full in respect to degrees; "and thou shalt make its horns," signifies power; "upon the four corners thereof," signifies complete 
power; "from it shall be its horns," signifies that the power shall be from good; "and thou shalt overlay it with brass," signifies a representative of good; "and thou shalt make its pans to take 
away its ashes," signifies what is to be removed after uses; "and its shovels, and its basins, and its fleshhooks, and its fire-tongs," signifies memory- knowledges that contain and that are of service 
for every use; "all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass," signifies all things from good; " and thou shalt make for it a grating, a network," signifies the sensuous, which is the ultimate; 
"of brass," signifies which also is from good; "and upon the net shalt thou make four rings of brass," signifies the sphere of good through which there is conjunction; "upon the four extremities of it," 
signifies everywhere; "and thou shalt bestow it under the compass of the altar beneath," signifies this in ultimates; "and the net shall be even unto the middle of the altar," signifies the extension 
of the sensuous; "and thou shalt make staves for the altar," signifies the power of keeping in a state of good; "staves of shittim wood," signifies the good of righteousness and the consequent power; 
"and shalt overlay them with brass," signifies a representative of good; "and the staves thereof shall be put into the rings," signifies the power of the sphere of Divine good; "and the staves shall 
be upon the two sides of the altar," signifies the power of good through truth, and of truth from good; "in carrying it," signifies coming-forth and subsistence; "hollow of boards shalt thou make it," 
signifies application; "as thou wast made to see in the mountain, so shall they make it," signifies from the correspondence of Divine things in heaven. </p>

and its forks, and its tongs; all its vessels you shall make of bronze.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And you shall make for it a grating, a network, from bronze; and on the net you shall make four rings of bronze, on the four 
ends of it. And you shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, and the net shall reach down to the middle of the altar. And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of shittim wood, and overlay 
them with bronze. And its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> A boarded hollow you shall make it; as it has appeared to you

which have served their purpose. 'And shovels, and basins, and its forks, and its tongs' means known facts that act as containers and serve every purpose. 'All its vessels you shall make of bronze' 
means that they must all be formed from good. 'And you shall make for it a grating, a network' means the level of sensory perception, which is the last and lowest. 'From bronze' means that this too must 
be formed from good. 'And on the net you shall make four rings of bronze' means the sphere of good by means of which a joining together is accomplished. 'On the four ends of it' means everywhere. 'And 
you shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath' means that sensory perception on the last and lowest levels. 'And the net shall reach down to the middle of the altar' means the extent of sensory 
perception. 'And you shall make poles for the altar' means the power to hold something in a state of good. 'Poles of shittim wood' means the good of righteousness, [and the power derived from this 
good.] 'And overlay them with bronze' means a representative sign of the good. 'And its poles shall be put into the rings' means the power of the sphere of Divine Good. 'And the poles shall be on the 
two sides of the altar' means the power of good imparted through truth,<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> and that of the truth which springs from the good. 'When it is carried' means bringing into being and keeping in being. 'A 
boarded hollow you shall make it' means the suitableness. 'As it has appeared to you on the mountain, so they shall make [it]' means in keeping with the correspondence of Divine realities in heaven.
