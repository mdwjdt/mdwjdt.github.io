<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第798节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>798.</strong>“水势比山高过十五肘，山岭都淹没了”表无一丝良善存留，“十五”表极其稀少，几近于无。这一点从前面（6:15）有关数字“五”的含义明显可知，此处说明了就圣言的风格，就内义而言，“五”表少许。由于数字“十五”是由表示少许的五和表示余留的十(如前所述，6:3）组成的，所以“十五”表余留，这类人的余留几近于无。因为大量的虚假信念灭绝了一切良善。至于人身上的余留，如前所述，事实是，诸如这些大洪水前之人的虚假原则，尤其是虚假信念具有这样的性质：它们已彻底关闭并隐藏余留，以至于这些余留无法被取出来。一旦被取出来，它们会立刻被歪曲。事实上，信念所固有的生命乃是这样：它不但拒绝一切真理，吸收一切虚假，还滥用接近它的一切真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]798.</strong> The meaning of fifteen cubits upward the water towered, and it covered the mountains, as the fact that nothing was left of charity, and the symbolism of fifteen as what is so meager as to be hardly anything, can be seen from the symbolism of five. This was dealt with above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_798/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_15" target=_top>Genesis 6:15</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_649" target=_top>649</a>], where it was shown that according to the Word's mode of expression, or in its inner meaning, five symbolizes a small amount. And since fifteen is made out of five, symbolizing a little, and ten, symbolizing what remains (as shown above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_798/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>Genesis 6:3</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576" target=_top>576</a>]), it has to do with the remnant these people possessed, which hardly amounted to anything. The falsities of which people had persuaded themselves were so enormous that they eradicated everything good.<br />How the case stands with the remnant stored inside people was described earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_562" target=_top>562-563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_571" target=_top>571</a>]: false premises and especially distorted convictions, as they existed among these pre-Flood people, locked up any surviving traces [of truth and goodness] and shut them away so entirely that they could not be brought out again. If they had been, they would have been falsified immediately. The vital force of delusions is such that it not only rejects everything true and soaks up everything false but also perverts any truth that does come near. </p>

Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and covered the mountains. That this signifies that nothing of charity remained; and that "fifteen" signifies so few as to be scarcely any, is evident from 
the signification of the number "five" (of which above, chapter 6, verse 15), where it was shown that in the style of the Word, or in the internal sense, "five" signifies a few; and since the number 
"fifteen" is composed of five, signifying a few, and of ten, which signifies remains (as was shown above, chapter 6, verse 3), therefore "fifteen" signifies remains, which with this people were scarcely 
any. For so many were the persuasions of falsity that they extinguished every good. As for the remains with man, the fact was, as already said, that principles of falsity, and still more, persuasions 
of falsity, such as were with these antediluvians, had so entirely shut in and hidden away the remains that these could not be brought out, and if brought out they would forthwith have been falsified. 
For such is the life of persuasions that it not only rejects every truth and absorbs every falsity, but also perverts every truth that comes near. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 798</b></p><p><b>798.</b>
'From fifteen cubits upwards the waters prevailed and covered the mountains' means that no trace of charity remained; and 'fifteen' means things so few as to be scarcely any at all. This becomes clear 
from the meaning of the number 'five', dealt with in Chapter 6:15. There it was shown that in the style of the Word, that is, in the internal sense, 'five' means those that are few. And since the number 
fifteen is the sum of five, which means few, and of ten, which means remnants, as has been shown at 6:3, this number has regard to remnants, which with those people were hardly anything at all. For 
so great were the persuasions of falsity that they did away with everything good. With regard to the remnants residing with man, the false assumptions, as stated already, and still more the persuasions 
of falsity, were of such a nature with the people before the Flood that they shut in and shut away remnants so completely that they could not be brought out. And if they had been brought out they 
would have been falsified in an instant. Indeed the life inherent in persuasions is such that it not only rejects everything true and soaks up everything false, but also perverts any truth that goes near it.  </p>

</p><b>798.</b>
Quod 'quindecim cubitis de sursum superarunt aquae, et operuerunt montes,' significent quod nihil residui esset de cogitate; et quod 'quindecim' significent ita paucum ut vix quicquam, constare potest 
ex significatione numeri 'quinque,' de qua cap. praec. vi vers. 15; ubi ostensum quod 'quinque' in stilo Verbi, seu in sensu interno, significent paucum: et quia numerus quindecim compositus est ex 
quinque, quae significant paucum, et ex decem, quae significant 'reliquias,' ut ostensum cap. praec. vi vers 3, spectat hic numerus reliquias, quae apud eos vix erant aliquid: nam persuasiones falsi 
tantae erant ut exstinxerint omne bonum.  Cum reliquiis apud hominem se res habet, ut prius dictum, quod principia falsi, et adhuc magis persuasiones falsi, quales fuerunt apud hos antediluvianos, incluserint 
et secluserint ita prorsus reliquias ut non produci possent, et si productae fuissent, quod ilico falsificatae fuissent; vita enim persuasionum talis est ut non solum rejiciat omne verum et insorbeat 
omne falsum, sed etiam verum quod alluit, pervertat. </p>
