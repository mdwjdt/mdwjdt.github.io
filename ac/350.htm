<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>350.</strong>创世记4:4 亚伯也将他羊群中头生的和羊的脂油献上。耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物。<br />“亚伯”在此仍表仁；“羊群中头生的”表圣物，唯独属于主；“脂油”表属天本身，也属于主；“耶和华看中亚伯和他的供物”表仁的事物，一切基于仁的敬拜，为主所悦纳。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]350.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_350/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_4" target=_top>Genesis 4:4</a>. And Abel, too, brought forward some of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And Jehovah looked on Abel and on his offering.<br />Abel here symbolizes charity, as he did earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_350/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_325" target=_top>325-326</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_350/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_341" target=_top>341-342</a>]. The firstborn of the flock symbolize holiness, which is exclusively the Lord's. The fat symbolizes the actual quality of heaven, which is also the Lord's. Jehovah looked on Abel and on his offering means that everything connected with charity was pleasing to the Lord, as was all worship springing from charity. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 350</b></p><p><b>350.</b>
Verse 4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof; and Jehovah looked to Abel, and to his offering. By "Abel" here as before is signified charity; and by the "firstlings 
of the flock" is signified that which is holy, which is of the Lord alone; by "fat" is signified the celestial itself, which also is of the Lord; and by "Jehovah looking unto Abel, and to his 
offering" that the things of charity, and all worship grounded in charity, were well-pleasing to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 350</b></p><p><b>350.</b>
Verse 4 And Abel brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat; and Jehovah had respect for Abet and his gift.  </p>
<p>Here, as previously, 'Abel' means charity. 'The firstborn of the flock' 
means the holy which is the Lord's alone. 'Fat' means the celestial itself, which also is the Lord's. 'Jehovah had respect for Abel and his gift' means that things constituting charity, and all worship 
deriving from it, were acceptable to the Lord.  </p>

Vers. 4.  Et Habel attulit etiam ille de primogenitis gregis tui et de pinguedine eorum: et aspexit Jehovah ad Habel et ad munus illius Per 'Habelem' significatur hic ut prius charitas: per 'primogenita 
gregis' sanctum quod est solius Domini: per 'pinguedinem' ipsum caeleste quod etiam est Domini: quod 'aspexit Jehovah ad Habelem et ad munus ejus' significat quod Domino grata fuerunt quae charitatis 
et omnis cultus inde. </p>
