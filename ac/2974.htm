<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2974节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2974.</strong>“都定准归与亚伯拉罕作产业”表它们，也就是在信之良善与真理，因而在一切内在与外在认知方面，重生的全部质与量，唯独被归于主。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表和“产业”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕”是指主，这在前面已频繁说明；“产业”是指属于主，因而唯独被归于祂的事物。信的头条就是：一切良善和一切真理都是主的，因而唯独来自主。人越从内在承认这一点，就越内在地居于天堂。天上的人都直觉事实就是如此，并且那里有一种直觉事实就是如此的气场。因为他们由唯独来自主的良善所主导，这就是那所谓在主里面的。这种直觉的程度从中间到外围逐渐减弱，如前所述（<a href="2973.htm">2973</a>节）。</p>

Were made sure unto Abraham for an acquisition. That this signifies that they were ascribed to the Lord alone, that is, everything of regeneration as to both quality and quantity, in regard to the good 
and truth of faith, and therefore in regard to all knowledges interior and exterior, is evident from the representation of "Abraham" as being the Lord (of which frequently above); and from the signification 
of an "acquisition," as being His, and thus ascribed to Him alone. It is a primary article of faith that all good and all truth are the Lord's, thus from the Lord alone. The more interiorly 
anyone acknowledges this, the more interiorly he is in heaven; for in heaven it is perceived to be so, and there is there a sphere of perception that it is so; for they are in good which is from the Lord 
alone, and this is what is called being in the Lord. The degrees of this perception decrease from the midst even to the circumferences (as was said just above, n. 2973). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2974</b></p><p><b>2974.</b>
'Was made over to Abraham as an acquisition' means that these things - the whole nature and extent of regeneration as regards the good and truth of faith, and so as regards all interior and exterior 
cognitions - were considered to be the Lord's alone. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord, often dealt with already, and from the meaning of 'an acquisition' as those things 
that are His, and so are considered to be His alone. It is a leading article of faith that all good and all truth are the Lord's, and so come from the Lord alone. The more anyone acknowledges this inwardly 
the more he is inwardly in heaven, for those in heaven see with perception that this is so. In heaven a sphere of perception that it is so exists because those there are governed by good which is 
derived from the Lord alone; and this is called being in the Lord. The degrees of that perception go from the middle to outlying parts, as stated immediately above in <a href="2973.htm">2973</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2974</b>
</p><b>2974.</b>
Quod `Abrahamo in acquisitionem' significet quod soli Domino accepta, nempe omne regenerationis quale et quantum, quoad bonum et verum fidei, et sic quoad omnes cognitiones interiores et exteriores, 
constat a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, de qua saepius prius; et a significatione acquisitionis quod sint Ipsius, {1}ita Ipsi soli accepta.  Primarium fidei est, {2}quod omne bonum et 
omne verum sit Domini, ita a Domino solo; quo quis hoc interius agnoscit, eo interius in caelo est, nam in caelo percipitur quod ita sit; ibi est perceptionis sphaera quod ita sit, quia sunt in bono quod 
est a solo Domino, et hoc est quod dicitur esse in Domino; gradus perceptionis illius se habent a medio usque ad circuitus, sicut mox supra n. 2973 dictum est. @1 nempe$  @2 i quod credatur$  </p>
