<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6158节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6158.</strong>“作田地里的种子”表作心智的滋养。这从“种子”和“田地”的含义清楚可知：“种子”是指真理与良善，因而是指信与仁，如前所述（<a href="6154.htm">6154</a>节）；“田地”在普遍意义上是指教会（参看<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节），在特定意义上是指一个人里面的教会，因而是指一个拥有教会在里面的人，也就是接受真理与良善的一个人。当这个人被称为“田地”时，所指的是他的心智；因为人之为人不是凭他的外形，而是凭他的心智，也就是凭他构成其心智的理解力和意愿，以及构成更内层心智的信之真理和仁之良善。由于后者，即心智，才是真正意义上的人，所以他被真理与良善滋养和维持；“种子”因表示真理与良善，故也表示滋养。事实上，这一点从接下来的话明显看出来：“也作你们和你们家人的食物，作你们小孩子的食物”。由此可见，“田地里的种子”表示心智的滋养。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6158</b></p><p><b>6158.</b>
For seed of the field. That this signifies for the nourishment of the mind, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being truth and good, thus as being faith and charity (of which above, n. 6154); 
and from the signification of "field," as being in a general sense the church (see n. 2971, 3766), and in a particular sense the church in a man, thus a man in whom the church is, that is, who receives 
truth and good. When he is called a "field," it is his mind that is meant; for man is not man from his external form, but from his mind, that is, from his understanding and will which constitute 
his mind, and also from the truth of faith and the good of charity which constitute the still more inward mind. This, namely, the mind, when it is in the genuine sense a man, is nourished and sustained 
by truth and good; and as truth and good are signified by "seed," nourishment also is signified by it, which indeed is plain from the words that directly follow: "for your food, and for them in your 
houses, and for food for your babes." Hence then it is that the "seed of the field" denotes the nourishment of the mind. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6158</b></p><p><b>6158.</b>
'For seed of the field' means for mental nourishment. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as truth and good, and so faith and charity, dealt with above in <a href="6154.htm">6154</a>; and from the meaning of 'the field' 
in a general sense as the Church, dealt with in <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>, and in a particular sense as the Church with the individual person, thus a person who has the Church within him, that is, who is receptive 
of truth and good. When that person is called 'the field', his mind is what is meant; for a human being is not a human being by virtue of the outward form he takes but by virtue of his mind, that is, 
of his understanding and will which constitute his mind, and also by virtue of the truth of faith and the good of charity which constitute a yet more interior mind. Since the latter, the mind, is in 
a genuine sense the human being, he is nourished and sustained by truth and good. And because truth and good are meant by 'seed', nourishment is also meant by it. This is also evident from the words 
that immediately follow - 'for your food, and for those in your households, and for food for your young children'. From all this one may now see that 'seed of the field' means mental nourishment. </p>

</p><b>6158.</b>
`Ad semen agri':  quod significet ad nutritionem mentis, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod sit verum et bonum, ita fides et charitas, de qua supra n. 6154; et ex significatione `agri' quod sit 
in communi sensu Ecclesia, de qua n. 2971, 3766, et in particulari Ecclesia apud hominem, ita homo in quo Ecclesia, hoc est, qui recipit verum et bonum; is cum dicitur `ager', est mens ejus quae intelligitur, 
nam homo est homo non ex forma externa sed ex mente sua, hoc est, ex intellectu et voluntate quae constituunt mentem, tum ex vero fidei et bono charitatis quae constituunt mentem adhuc interiorem; 
haec, nempe mens, cum est in genuino sensu homo, nutritur et sustentatur a vero et bono; et quia verum et bonum per `semen' significantur, etiam per illud significatur nutritio; quod etiam patet 
ab illis quae mox sequuntur `ad cibum vestrum, et illis in domibus vestris, et ad cibum infantibus vestris'; inde nunc est quod `semen agri' sit nutritio mentis. @1 see p. 469, ftnote I$ </p>
