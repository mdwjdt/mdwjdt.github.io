<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>365.</strong>再次说：“他必恋慕你，你却要制伏他”，意思是，仁渴望与信同在，但却不能，因为信想要制伏它，这有违秩序。只要信寻求统治，就不是信，只有仁掌权时才成为信；因为信的首要之事就是仁，如前所示。仁可比作火焰，没有它，就没有热与光，因为它是热与光的源头。分离之信好比没有热的光，当然还是光，但却是严冬之光，其中万物萧条枯萎。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]365.</strong> The third thing it says is he longs for you, but you rule him, meaning that charity wants to coexist with faith but cannot because faith wants to rule over it, which goes against proper order. As long as faith wants to be in charge, it is not faith. But when charity is in charge, faith is faith. This is because the main concern of faith is charity, as shown before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_365/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_344" target=_top>344</a>].<br />Charity can be compared to a flame, which is essential for heat and light, since they come from it. Faith when separated can be compared to light, which without the warmth of the flame is still light, but a wintry light — and there is nothing that does not languish and die in winter's light. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 365</b></p><p><b>365.</b>
In the third place it is said, "Unto thee is his desire, and thou rulest over him" by which is signified that charity is desirous to abide with faith, but cannot do so because faith wishes to rule over 
it, which is contrary to order. So long as faith seeks to have the dominion, it is not faith, and only becomes faith when charity rules; for charity is the principal of faith, as was shown above. Charity 
maybe compared to flame, which is the essential of heat and light, for heat and light are from it; and faith in a state of separation may be compared to light that is without the heat of flame, 
when indeed there is light, but it is the light of winter in which everything becomes torpid and dies. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 365</b></p><p><b>365.</b>
(<a href="3.htm">3</a>) To you is his desire, and you have dominion over him', which means that charity wishes to reside with faith but cannot because faith wishes to have dominion over it, which is contrary to order. As 
long as faith wishes to have dominion, it is not faith. But once charity has dominion it is faith. for the chief thing of faith is charity, as shown already. Charity may be compared to a flame of fire, 
without which heat and light do not exist since it is the source of heat and light; separated faith may be compared to light which, when devoid of the heat of the flame, is certainly light, but winter 
light when everything becomes inactive and dies off.  </p>

</p><b>365.</b>
Tertium est quod 'ad te desiderium ejus, et tu dominaris ei,' quo significatur quod charitas apud fidem esse velit sed quod non possit quia fides vult dominari ei, quod est contra ordinem; quamdiu fides 
vult dominari, non est fides; sed cum charitas dominatur, tunc est fides; nam principale fidei est charitas, ut prius ostensum est. Charitas potest comparari flammae, quae est essentiale caloris 
et lucis, nam inde calor et lux; fides separata potest comparari luci, quae cum absque calore flammae, tunc quidem est lux, sed lux hiemis, qua nihil non torpescit et emoritur. </p>
