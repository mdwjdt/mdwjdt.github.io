<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9410节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9410.</strong>“祂不伸手”表在其能力中的这真理并不存在于那里。这从“手”的含义清楚可知，“手”是指经由真理而来的能力。“手”表示能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="5544.htm">5544</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>，<a href="8050.htm">8050</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>，<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>，<a href="9025.htm">9025</a>，<a href="9133.htm">9133</a>节）；这能力经由真理而来（<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="3502.htm">3502</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="6423.htm">6423</a>，<a href="8304.htm">8304</a>节）；真理从良善，也就是说，经由良善从主那里取得其一切能力（<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="8200.htm">8200</a>，<a href="9327.htm">9327</a>节）。由此明显可知，“祂不伸手在分别出来的以色列人身上”表示在其能力中的真理不与那些局限于脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义的人同在。在其能力中的真理不与他们同在的原因是，他们与天堂分离，因而与主分离；事实上，圣言将一个人与天堂结合在一起，并通过天堂与主结合在一起，因为构成圣言字义的一切都对应于天使所在的属灵和属天事物。如果只照字面，而不同时照教会的某种教义，也就是圣言的内在来理解圣言，与天使就没有任何联系。<br />以主对彼得所说的话为例：<br />你是彼得，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上，阴间的门，不能胜过它。我要把天国的钥匙给你。凡你在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑。凡你在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">16:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.19.htm">19</a>）<br />还有祂对门徒说的话：<br />我实在告诉你们，凡你们在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑。凡你们在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.18.htm">18:18</a>）<br />那些局限于脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义的人，因而那些与教会的真正教义分离的人，会说服自己确信，主将这种权柄赋予了彼得，也赋予了主的其他门徒。这种信念导致这种了地狱般的异端邪说，即：某些人有权柄让凡他们所愿意的人进入天堂，或把他们关在天堂之外；而事实上，根据教会的真正教义，也就是圣言的内在，唯独主拥有这种权柄。因此，那些知道圣言的外在意义，同时也知道它的内在意义的人就明白，主的这些话是指从主所获得的信和信之真理说的；拥有这种权柄的，是从主所获得的这种信，因而是主自己，绝不是任何人。<br />事实的确如此，这一点从彼得和十二个门徒的代表，以及“磐石”和“钥匙”的含义可以看出来。彼得代表信（参看创世记18章和22章的序言，以及<a href="3750.htm">3750</a>，<a href="4738.htm">4738</a>，<a href="6000.htm">6000</a>，<a href="6073.htm">6073</a>e节）；主的十二个门徒，和以色列的十二个支派一样，代表信和爱的各个方面（<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）；“磐石”表示信方面的主，因而表示从主所获得的信（参看<a href="8581.htm">8581</a>节）；“钥匙”表示权柄或能力，这从圣言中提到“钥匙”的经文明显看出来，如下列经文：<br />我是首先的，是末后的；我又是那存活的，曾死过；看哪，我是活着的，直到世世代代。并且我拿着阴间和死亡的钥匙。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">1:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />启示录：<br />这些事是那圣洁、真实，拿着大卫的钥匙，开了就没有人能关，关了就没有人能开的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.7.htm">3:7</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />我必将大卫家的钥匙放在祂肩头上，祂开，无人能关；祂关，无人能开。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.22.htm">22:22</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“钥匙”表示权柄或能力，这是显而易见的；唯有主拥有这种权柄。<br />由此可见，那些局限于脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义的人是何品质，即：他们根本没有与天堂结合，因而没有与主结合。那些根据字义解释主对彼得和门徒所说的这些话的人就是这种情况，因为他们僭取拯救人类的权柄，使自己成为天地之神；他们如此行是出于疯狂的自我之爱和尘世之爱。凡理性思考的人都能看出并明白，人根本不可能赦免任何罪，因为罪唯有通过形成或发展一种新的生活，也就是唯有通过被主重生才能得以赦免。重生一直持续到人在世生命的结束，之后直到永远（参看<a href="8548.htm">8548</a>-<a href="8553.htm">8553</a>，<a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>，<a href="8742.htm">8742</a>-<a href="8747.htm">8747</a>，<a href="8853.htm">8853</a>-<a href="8858.htm">8858</a>，<a href="8958.htm">8958</a>-<a href="8969.htm">8969</a>节）。<br />还必须简要说一说何为“在其能力中”的真理。在圣言中，天使被称为“大能者”，而且在教会也众所周知，他们就是大能者。然而，他们不是凭自己，而是凭主而为大能者，因为他们是发自主的神之真理的接受者。他们从主拥有如此的大能，以致他们当中的一位就能赶走一千个魔鬼团伙，把他们关在地狱，约束他们。因为发自主的神之真理充满众天堂，并形成它们；你若愿意相信，一切事物都是通过这真理而被制作和创造的。圣言（或译为道）太初与神同在，并且就是神，万物都是藉着圣言造的，世界也是藉着圣言造的（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>），这圣言就是神性真理。神性真理是唯一真实的物质，万物皆从它产生；很少有人能明白这一点，因为如今人们对神性真理没有其它概念，只是认为它是从统治万有的那一位口中所出的话语，要按照这些话来执行他的命令。至于人们对神性真理当持有什么样的观念，可参看前文（<a href="9407.htm">9407</a>e节）。圣言中的许多经文，尤其启示录都描述了发自主的神性真理的全能：<br />在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战。龙也同他的使者去争战。他们并没有得胜，天上再没有他们的地方。他们胜过他，是因羔羊的血，和他们所见证的话。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.7.htm">12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.11.htm">11</a>）<br />显然，“羔羊的血”是指从主的神性人身发出的神性真理（参看<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>，<a href="9393.htm">9393</a>，<a href="9395.htm">9395</a>节）；“他们所见证的话”是指被接受的神之真理。<br />局限于脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义的人，因而那些与教会的真正教义分离的人，只根据字面来理解这些预言。也就是说，他们认为“血”是指指血液，因而是指主的受难；而事实上，发自主的神性真理才是这些话中“血”的意思。那些处于教会的真正教义的人就能知道，他们不靠血，而是靠倾听神的真理并遵行它而得救；因此，凡允许主通过神性真理使使自己重生的人都会得救。凡从主获得启示或光照的人，因而凡处于仁和信的良善之人，都能知道、理解、看见并觉察到这一点，因为他们就是那些获得启示或光照的人。我自己可以肯定地说，当我读到“羔羊的血”，并思想主的宝血时，与我同在的天使只知道我所读的是从主发出的神性真理，我所想的就是这真理。不过，就让简单人去持守自己的教义，认为他们因着主的宝血得救去吧，只要他们照主的神性真理生活；因为那些如此生活的人在来世会获得启示或光照。</p>

He sent not His hand. That this signifies that truth is not there in its power, is evident from the signification of the "hand," as being the power that there is through truth. (That "the hand" denotes 
power, see n. 878, 3091, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 7011, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8153, 8281, 9025, 9133; and that it is through truth, n. 3091, 3502, 6344, 6423, 8304; also that 
all the power of truth is from good, thus through good from the Lord, n. 6948, 8200, 9327.) From this it is evident that by "He sent not His hand unto the sons of Israel who were set apart" is signified 
that truth is not in its power with those who are in the external sense of the Word separate from the internal. The reason why truth is not in its power with these is that they have been separated 
from heaven, and therefore from the Lord; for the Word conjoins man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, because all things of the sense of the letter of the Word correspond to the spiritual 
and celestial things in which are the angels, and with which there is no communication if the Word is apprehended merely according to the letter, and not at the same time according to any doctrine 
of the church, which is the internal of the Word. [2] Let us take for example the words of the Lord to Peter: </p>
<p>     Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shall loose on 
earth shall be loosed in the heavens (Matt. 16:18, 19). In like manner His words to the disciples: </p>
<p>     Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and 
what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven (Matt. 18:18). They who are in the external sense of the Word separate from the internal, thus who are separate from the true doctrine 
of the church, persuade themselves that such a power was given by the Lord to Peter, and also to the rest of the Lord's disciples. Hence came that infernal heresy that it is in human power to let 
into heaven and to shut out from heaven whomsoever it will; when yet according to the true doctrine of the church, which is also the internal of the Word, the Lord alone has this power; and therefore 
those who are in the external sense of the Word and at the same time in its internal sense, apprehend that these things were said of faith and its truths which are from the Lord, and that faith from 
the Lord, thus the Lord Himself, has this power, and therefore by no means any man. [3] That it is so can be seen from the representation of Peter and of the twelve disciples, and from the signification 
of a "rock," and likewise from the signification of "keys." (That Peter represented faith, see the preface to Genesis 18 and 22, also n. 3750, 4738, 6000, 6073; and that the twelve disciples of the 
Lord, like the twelve tribes of Israel, represented all things of faith and love, n. 3488, 3858, 6397.) That a "rock" signifies the Lord in respect to faith, and thus faith which is from the Lord, 
may be seen above (n. 8581); and that "keys" signify power, is evident from the passages in the Word where "keys" are mentioned; as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     I am the first and the last; he that 
liveth, and was dead; but behold I am alive unto ages of ages; and I have the keys of hell and of death (Rev. 1:18).      These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of 
David, He that openeth, and no man shutteth, and He that shutteth, and no man openeth (Rev. 3:7).      The key of the house of David will I lay upon His shoulder; that He may open and none shut, and 
that He may shut and none open (Isa. 22:22). That in these passages a "key" denotes power, is manifest; also that the power belongs to the Lord alone. [4] From all this it can be seen of what quality 
are those who are in the external sense of the Word separate from the internal; namely, that they have no conjunction with heaven, thus none with the Lord, as is the case with those who explain these 
words of the Lord to Peter and to the disciples according to the letter, and thus arrogate to themselves the power of saving mankind, and make themselves gods of heaven and earth; and this from an 
insane love of self and of the world. Everyone who thinks from sound reason can see and apprehend that man cannot loose one sin, because sin is loosed solely through the formation of a new life; that 
is, through regeneration from the Lord. (That regeneration goes on up to the end of man's life in the world, and afterward to eternity, see n. 8548-8553, 8635-8640, 8742-8747, 8853-8858, 8958-8969.) [5] 
What truth "in its power" is, shall also be briefly told. That in the Word the angels are called "powers," and also that they are powers, is known in the church. Yet they are not powers from themselves, 
but from the Lord, because they are recipients of the truth Divine which is from the Lord. They have such power from the Lord that one of them can drive away, shut up in the hells, and restrain, 
a thousand of the diabolical crew. For the truth Divine which is from the Lord fills the heavens, and makes the heavens; and if you will believe it, all things have been made and created through it. 
The Word, which was in the beginning with God, and which was God, through which all things were created, and through which the world was made (John 1:1-14) is Divine truth. That this is the one only 
substantial thing, from which are all things, few are able to apprehend, because no other idea is at this day held about Divine truth than as of the speech of the mouth of one in authority, in accordance 
with which his commands are executed; but what idea ought to be held about it may be seen above (n. 9407). The omnipotence of the Divine truth which is from the Lord is described in many passages 
in the Word; and also in John: </p>
<p>     There was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought, and his angels; but they prevailed not, neither was their place 
found any more in heaven. They overcame him through the blood of the Lamb, and through the word of their testimony (Rev. 12:7, 8, 11). That "the blood of the Lamb" denotes the Divine truth that proceeds 
from the Divine Human of the Lord, see n. 4735, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127, 9393, 9395; and that "the word of their testimony" denotes the truth Divine which is received, is plain. [6] They who 
are in the external sense of the Word separate from the internal, thus who are separated from the true doctrine of the church, apprehend this prophetic saying no otherwise than according to the letter; 
namely, that by "blood" is meant blood, thus the Lord's passion; when yet it is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord that is there meant by "blood." They who are in the true doctrine of the 
church are able to know that they are not saved by blood, but by hearing truth Divine, and doing it; thus that those are saved who suffer themselves to be regenerated by the Lord through the Divine truth. 
This all are able to know, to apprehend, to see, and to perceive, who are in enlightenment from the Lord; thus all who are in the good of charity and of faith, for these are they who are enlightened. 
This I can avouch - that when I am reading "the blood of the Lamb," and am thinking of the blood of the Lord, the angels who are with me know no otherwise than that I am reading "the Divine truth 
that proceeds from the Lord," and that I am thinking about this. But let the simple remain in their doctrine, that they are saved through the Lord's blood, provided they live in accordance with His Divine 
truth; for they who so live are enlightened in the other life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9410</b></p><p><b>9410.</b>
'He did not lay a hand' means that truth in its power is not present there. This is clear from the meaning of 'hand' as the power which comes through truth. For the meaning of 'hand' as power, see <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="5544.htm">5544</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>, <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>, <a href="8050.htm">8050</a>, <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>, <a href="8281.htm">8281</a>, <a href="9025.htm">9025</a>, <a href="9133.htm">9133</a>; for its coming through truth, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="3503.htm">3503</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="6423.htm">6423</a>, <a href="8304.htm">8304</a>; and for the fact that truth derives 
all its power from good, that is, from the Lord through good, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="8200.htm">8200</a>, <a href="9327.htm">9327</a>. From all this it is evident that 'He did not lay a hand towards the children of Israel who had been set apart' means 
that truth in its power is not present with those restricted to the outward sense of the Word, separated from the inward. The reason why truth is not present with them in its power is that they are 
separated from heaven and so from the Lord; for the Word joins a person to heaven, and through heaven to the Lord, because all the things constituting the sense of the letter of the Word correspond to 
the spiritual and celestial realities which exist with angels. There is no connection with the angels if the Word is understood according to the letter alone and not at the same time according to some 
teaching of the Church on the inner level of the Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Take for example the Lord's words to Peter,  </p>
<blockquote>
You are Peter, and on this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell will not 
prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:18</a>, 
<a href="19.htm">19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In like manner to the disciples,  </p>
<blockquote>
Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Those 
who are restricted to the outward sense of the Word, separated from the inward, thus those who are separated from the true teachings of the Church, convince themselves that such power was given to Peter 
by the Lord, and also to the rest of the Lord's disciples. This conviction leads to the hellish heresy that certain people possess the power to let into or shut out of heaven whomsoever they please, 
when in fact according to the true teachings of the Church, which lie on the inward level of the Word, the Lord alone has that power. Those therefore who know the outward sense of the Word and at the 
same time its inward sense understand that these things spoken by the Lord had regard to faith and the truths of faith which are received from the Lord, and that such faith received from the Lord possesses 
that power, thus the Lord Himself, and not at all any mere human being.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The truth of this may be recognized from the representation of Peter and of the twelve disciples, also from the 
meaning of 'rock', and from the meaning of 'keys' as well. Peter represented faith, see Prefaces to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a> and <a href="22.htm">22</a>, also <a href="3750.htm">3750</a>, <a href="4738.htm">4738</a>, <a href="6000.htm">6000</a>, <a href="6073.htm">6073</a> (end); the Lord's twelve disciples, like the twelve 
tribes of Israel, represented all aspects of faith and love, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>; 'rock' means the Lord in respect of faith, and so faith which is received from the Lord, <a href="8581.htm">8581</a>; and 'keys' means power, as 
is clear from places in the Word where keys are mentioned, such as in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I am the First and the Last, He who lives; and I was dead, but behold, I am alive for ever and ever, and have the keys 
of hell and of death. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:17, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book,  </p>
<blockquote>
These things says the One who is Holy, the One who is True, He who has the key of David, He who opens in order that no one may close, and 
closes in order that no one may open ... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:7, 8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will place the key of the house of David on His shoulder, in order that He may open and none shut, and He may shut and none 
open. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2022:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 22:22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In these places it is evident that 'key' means power and that the Lord alone possesses it.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this one can see what those people are like who are restricted to 
the outward sense of the Word, separated from the inward, namely people who are not at all joined to heaven, nor thus to the Lord. This is so with those who explain those words addressed by the Lord to 
Peter and to the disciples according to their literal meaning, in that they arrogate to themselves the power to save the human race and make themselves the gods of heaven and earth, which they do on 
account of their insane self-love and love of the world. Anyone sound in mind may see and appreciate that a mere human being cannot absolve any sin at all, because no sin is absolved except through the 
development of a new life, that is, through being regenerated by the Lord. Regeneration continues right on to the end of a person's life in the world, and after that for evermore, see <a href="8548.htm">8548</a>-<a href="8553.htm">8553</a>, <a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>,

 What truth in its power is must also be stated briefly. In the Word angels are called 'powers'; and it is also well known in the Church that they are 
such. Yet they are not powers by virtue of anything their own, only by virtue of the Lord; for they are recipients of God's truth which emanates from the Lord. The power they have from the Lord is such 
that one of them can drive away a thousand of the devil's crew, confine them to the hells, and keep them in check. For God's truth emanating from the Lord fills the heavens and forms them; and if you 
are willing to believe it, all things were made and created through that truth. The Word which was in the beginning with God and which was God, and through which all things were created and the world 
was made, spoken of in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-14</a>, is Divine Truth. Divine Truth is the one true substance from which all things come into being; but this is something few are able to understand, because at the present 
day the idea which people have of Divine Truth is no different from that of words coming from the lips of one who rules over all, whose orders are carried out according to those words. As for the 
kind of idea people ought in fact to have of Divine Truth, see <a href="9407.htm">9407</a> (end). The omnipotence of Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is described in many places in the Word, and especially in John, in 
the Book of Revelation,  </p>
<p>War took place in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels, but they did not prevail, nor was their place found any 
longer in heaven. They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:7,%208,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:7, 8, 11</a>.  </p>
<p>'The blood of the Lamb', it is evident, is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's 
Divine Human, see <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>, <a href="9393.htm">9393</a>, <a href="9395.htm">9395</a>; and 'the word of their testimony' is God's truth which has found acceptance.  </p>

 People who are restricted to the outward sense 
of the Word, separated from the inward, that is, those who are separated from the true teachings of the Church, understand these words of prophecy in solely a literal way. That is to say, they take 'blood' 
to mean blood, thus the Lord's passion, when in fact Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is what is meant in those words by 'blood'. People with the true teachings of the Church are able to know 
that they are saved not by blood but by hearing God's truth and doing it, thus [that all are saved] who allow the Lord to regenerate them by means of Divine Truth. All who receive enlightenment from 
the Lord are able to know, understand, see, and perceive this, thus all who are governed by the good of charity and faith are able to do so, since it is they who receive enlightenment. I myself can certainly 
say that when I read the blood of the Lamb and think of the Lord's blood the angels present with me know no other than that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is what I read and that that Truth 
is what I think of. But let simple people hold on to the teaching they have that they are saved by the Lord's blood, so long as they are leading a life in keeping with His Divine Truth; for those 
who lead such a life receive enlightenment in the next life.  </p>

`Non misit manum suam':  quod significet quod ibi non verum in sua potentia, constat ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia quae per verum; quod `manus' sit potentia, videatur n. 878, 3091, 3387, 
4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 7011, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8153, 8281, 9025, 9133, quod sit per verum, n. 3091, 3503, 6344, (x)6423, 8304, et quod omnis potentia veri sit ex bono, ita per 
bonum a Domino, n. 6948, 8200, 9327; inde patet quod per `non misit manum suam ad sepositos filios Israelis' significetur quod illis qui in sensu Verbi externo separato ab interno sunt non sit verum 
in sua potentia; causa quod apud illos non verum sit in sua potentia, est quia separati sunt a caelo, et sic a Domino, Verbum enim conjungit hominem caelo, et per caelum Domino, quoniam omnia quae sunt 
sensus litterae Verbi correspondent rebus spiritualibus et caelestibus in quibus sunt angeli; cum quibus nulla communicatio est si Verbum modo secundum litteram capitur, et non simul secundum aliquod 
doctrinale Ecclesiae, quod est internum Verbi. Pro exemplo sint Domini verba ad Petrum, 2 Tu es Petrus, et super {1}hac petra aedificabo Ecclesiam Meam, et portae inferni non praevalebunt illi; 
et dabo tibi claves regni caelorum, et quicquid ligaveris in terra, erit ligatum in caelis, et quicquid solveris in terra, erit solutum in caelis, Matth. xvi [18,] 19: </p>
<p>pariter ad discipulos, Amen dico 
vobis, Quaecumque ligaveritis super terra erunt (x)ligata in caelo, et quaecumque solveritis super terra erunt soluta in {2}caelo, Matth. xviii 18; </p>
<p>qui in sensu externo Verbi separato ab interno sunt, 
ita qui separati a vera doctrina Ecclesiae, sibi persuadent quod talis potestas a Domino data sit Petro, et quoque reliquis discipulis (d)Domini; inde infernalis illa haeresis quod in humana potestate 
sit intromittere in caelum et excludere e caelo quemcumque libet; cum tamen secundum veram Ecclesiae doctrinam, quae etiam est internum Verbi, illa potestas est soli Domino; quapropter qui in sensu 
Verbi externo et simul in interno sunt capiunt quod haec dicta sint de fide et ejus veris quae a Domino, et quod fidei a Domino, ita Ipsi Domino illa potestas sit, 3 et sic nullatenus alicui homini; 
quod ita sit, constare potest a repraesentatione `Petri' et `duodecim discipulorum,' tum a significationi `petrae,' et quoque a significatione `clavium'; quod `Petrus' repraesentaverit fidem, videatur 
Praefatio ad Gen. xviii et xxii, tum n. 3750, 4738, 6000, 6073 fin., et quod `duodecim discipuli Domini,' sicut duodecim tribus Israelis, repraesentaverint omnia fidei et amoris: n. 3488, 3858, 6397; 
quod `petra' significet Dominum quoad fidem: et sic fidem quae a Domino, n. 8581, et quod `claves' significent potentiam, constat ex locis in Verbo ubi `claves' nominantur, ut apud Johannem, Ego 
sum Primus et Novissimus, Qui vivit et fui mortuus; sed ecce vivo Ego in saecula saeculorum, et habeo claves inferni et mortis, Apoc. i 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Haec dicit Sanctus, Verus, Qui habet clavem Davidis, 
Qui aperit ut nemo claudat, et claudit ut nemo aperiat, Apoc. iii 8: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, Dabo clavem domus Davidis super umerum Ipsius, ut aperiat et non claudens, et claudat nec aperiens, xxii 
22; </p>
<p>quod in his locis `clavis' sit potentia, patet, et quod ea sit soli Domino. 4 Ex his constare potest quales illi sunt qui in sensu Verbi externo separato ab interno sunt, quod nempe illis nulla 
conjunctio cum caelo sit, ita nulla cum Domino; sicut illi qui explicant illa verba Domini ad Petrum et ad discipulos secundum litteram, quod sibi arrogent potentiam salvandi genus humanum, ac se deos 
caeli et terrae faciant, et hoc ex vesano amore sui et mundi; (m)quisque qui ex sana ratione cogitat videre et capere potest quod homo non possit solvere unum peccatum, quoniam peccatum non solvitur 
nisi per formationem novae vitae {3}, hoc est, per regenerationem a Domino; quod regeneratio perstet usque ad finem vitae hominis in mundo, (c)et postea in aeternum,(n) {4}videatur n. 8548-8553, 8635-8640, 
8742-8747, 8853-8858, 8958-8968. Quid sit verum in sua potentia, etiam paucis dicetur: quod angeli 5 in Verbo dicantur `potentiae,' et quoque quod sint potentiae, in Ecclesia notum est; ast non 
sunt potentiae ex se sed ex Domino, quoniam sunt recipientes veri Divini quod a Domino; potentia illis a Domino talis est ut unus illorum possit mille ex turba diabolica abigere, includere infernis, 
et compescere; verum enim Divinum quod a Domino, {5} implet caelos et facit caelos; et si credere vultis, per id omnia facta et creata sunt; Verbum {6}, quod erat in principio apud Deum et quod erat Deus, 
per quod omnia creata sunt et per quod mundus factus, de quo apud Johannem i 1-14, est Divinum Verum; quod hoc sit unicum substantiale ex quo omnia, pauci possunt capere, quoniam idea de Divino Vero 
non alia hodie habetur quam qualis de loquela oris ex imperante, secundum quam mandata efficiuntur; sed qualis idea de illo habenda sit, videatur n. 9407 ad fin. Omnipotentia Divini Veri quod a Domino, 
describitur multis in locis in Verbo, et quoque apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, Factum est bellum in caelo; Michael et angeli ejus pugnarunt contra draconem; draco autem pugnavit et angeli ejus, sed 
non praevaluerunt; neque locus inventus est eorum amplius in caelo: vicerunt illum per sanguinem Agni, et per Verbum testimonii Sui, xii 7, 8, 11; </p>
<p>quod `sanguis Agni' sit Divinum Verum procedens a 
Divino Humano Domini, videatur n. 4735, (x)6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127, 9393, 9395, et quod `Verbum testimonii Sui' sit verum Divinum receptum, patet. Qui in (t)Verbi sensu externo separato ab interno 
sunt, ita qui 6 separati a (t)vera doctrina Ecclesiae, illi propheticum illud non aliter capiunt quam secundum litteram, quod nempe per `sanguinem' intelligatur sanguis, ita passio Domini, cum tamen 
est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino quod per sanguinem ibi significatur; qui in vera Ecclesiae doctrina sunt, illi scire possunt quod non per sanguinem salventur sed per audire verum Divinum et facere 
illud, ita qui per Divinum Verum patiuntur se regenerari a Domino; hoc scire, capere, videre, et percipere possunt omnes qui in illustratione sunt a Domino, ita omnes qui in bono charitatis et fidei 
{7}, nam hi sunt qui illustrantur; (m)hoc confiteri possum, quod cum lego sanguinem Agni et cogito de sanguine Domini, angeli apud me non aliter sciant quam quod legam Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, 
et quod cogitem de illo.(n) At simplices maneant in sua doctrina quod per sanguine Domini salventur, modo vivant secundum Divinum Ipsius Verum nam qui secundum id vivant illustrantur in altera vita. @1
