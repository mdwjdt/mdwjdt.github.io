THE      INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-9. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stones like the former ones, and I will write upon the tables the words that were upon the former tables, which 
thou brakest. And be thou ready against the morning, and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai, and stand for Me there upon the head of the mountain. And no man shall come up with thee, and moreover 
no man shall be seen in all the mountain; and no flock nor herd shall feed over against this mountain. And he hewed two tables of stones like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning, 
and went up unto Mount Sinai, as Jehovah commanded him, and took in his hands the two tables of stones. And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and called on the name of Jehovah. 
And Jehovah passed by over his faces, and called, Jehovah, Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering with angers, and great in goodness and in truth; keeping goodness unto thousands, bearing 
iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and in absolving will not absolve; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the sons' sons, upon the thirds and upon the fourths. And Moses 
made haste, and bowed himself to the earth, and adored. And he said, If I pray I have found grace in Thine eyes O Lord, let the Lord, I pray, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiff-necked people; 
and be propitious unto our iniquity and unto our sin, and make us Thine inheritance. "And Jehovah said unto Moses" signifies the conclusion about the Israelitish nation; "Hew thee two tables of stones 
like the former ones" signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, such as it was on account of that nation; "and I will write upon the tables the words that were upon the former 
tables, which thou brakest" signifies that the interior Divine celestial and spiritual things [of the Word, of the church, and of worship] are in these externals also; "and be thou ready against the 
morning, and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai" signifies a new beginning of the revelation of Divine truth; "and stand for Me there upon the head of the mountain" signifies from the inmost heaven 
where is the Divine love; "and no man shall come up with thee" signifies that the Israelitish nation cannot be in Divine truth; "and moreover no man shall be seen in all the mountain" signifies that 
they have been quite removed from it, thus outside of it; "and no flock nor herd shall feed over against this mountain" signifies that neither could they be instructed about the interior and exterior 
good of the church, of worship, and of the Word; "and he hewed two tables of stones like the former ones" signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, such as it was on account 
of the Israelitish nation; "and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto Mount Sinai" signifies a new beginning of the revelation of Divine truth; "as Jehovah commanded him" signifies that 
it was so done because they insisted; "and took in his hand the two tables of stones" signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, such as it was on account of the Israelitish 
nation; "and Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there" signifies the external of the Word in which is the Divine; "and called on the name of Jehovah" signifies the worship of the Lord 
from the truths and goods of faith and love; "and Jehovah passed by over his faces" signifies internal Divine things over external ones; "and called, Jehovah, Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious" signifies 
the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Divine Proceeding, from which is all good; "long-suffering with angers" signifies the Divine clemency; "and great in goodness and in truth" signifies 
that He is good itself and truth itself; "keeping goodness unto thousands" signifies forever; "bearing iniquity, and transgression, and sin" signifies the removal of evil and of its falsity so that 
it does not appear; "and in absolving will not absolve" signifies bearing even to the consummation; "visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the sons' sons" signifies the rejection 
and condemnation of evils and the derivative falsities in a long series; "upon the thirds and upon the fourths" signifies [the rejection and condemnation] of falsities and the derivative evils; "and 
Moses made haste, and bowed himself to the earth, and adored" signifies reception then from influx into the external, and worship from humiliation; "and he said, If I pray I have found grace in Thine 
eyes, O Lord" signifies because such an external was received; "let the Lord, I pray, go in the midst of us" signifies that the Divine may be within it; "for it is a stiff-necked people" signifies although 
the Israelitish nation does not receive the Divine interiorly; "and be propitious unto our iniquity and unto our sin" signifies that their interiors may be removed which abound in falsities and 
evils; "and make us Thine inheritance" signifies that nevertheless the church may be there. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE  </p>
<p>Verses 1-9  And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which 
you broke. And be ready by the morning; and you shall come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and you shall stand with Me there on the top of the mountain. And no one shall come up with you, and also 
no one shall be seen on all the mountain; also no flock or herd shall feed before this mountain. And he hewed two tablets of stone like the first ones; and Moses rose early in the morning, and went 
up to Mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took the two tablets of stone in his hand. And Jehovah descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah. And Jehovah 
passed through above his face, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering with regard to anger<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, and great in goodness and truth, keeping goodness for thousands, 
bearing iniquity and transgression and sin; and He does not at all absolve<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons and on the sons of sons, on the third and on the fourth [generations]. And 
Moses made haste and bowed to the earth, and adored. And he said, If now I have found grace in Your eyes, O Lord, let [my] Lord, I beg You, go in our midst, for they are a stiff-necked people; and 
pardon our iniquity and our sin<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, and make us Your inheritance. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means the conclusion regarding the Israelite nation. 'Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first 
ones' means the kind of outward form that the Word, the Church, and worship take on account of that nation. 'And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke' 
means the Divine celestial and spiritual realities belonging to the interior level of these three entities, which are present also in those external things. 'And be ready by the morning; and you shall 
come up to Mount Sinai' means a new beginning in the revelation of Divine Truth. 'And you shall stand with Me there on the top of the mountain' means coming from the inmost heaven, where Divine Love 
is. 'And no one shall come up with you' means that the Israelite nation is incapable of standing in Divine Truth. 'And also no one shall be seen on all the mountain' means that they are entirely remote 
from that Truth, and so stand outside it. 'Also no flock or herd shall feed before this mountain' means that neither were they capable of receiving instruction concerning the interior and exterior 
good of the Church, worship, and the Word. 'And he hewed two tablets of stone like the first ones' means the kind of outward form that the Word, the Church, and worship take on account of the Israelite 
nation. 'And Moses rose early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai' means a new beginning in the revelation of Divine Truth. 'As Jehovah had commanded him' means that such a thing should be 
done because of their insistence. 'And took the two tablets in his hand' means the kind of outward form that the Word, the Church, and worship take on account of the Israelite nation. 'And Jehovah descended 
in the cloud and stood with him there' means the outward form that the Word takes, in which the Divine is present. 'And proclaimed the name of Jehovah' means worship of the Lord springing from 
the truths and forms of the good of faith and love, and so preparation for reception. 'And Jehovah passed through above his face' means the internal and Divine realities above the external things. 'And 
proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious' means the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Divine proceeding, the Source of everything good. 'Long-suffering with regard to anger' means 
Divine leniency. 'And great in goodness and truth' means that He is absolute Goodness and absolute Truth. 'Keeping goodness for thousands' means eternally so. 'Bearing iniquity, transgression, and 
sin' means shifting evil and its falsity away in order that it may not be apparent. 'And He does not at all absolve' means allowing them to exist until they reach their closing stage. 'Visiting the 
iniquity of the fathers on the sons and on the sons of sons' means the rejection and condemnation of evils and of a long line of falsities arising from them. 'On the third and on the fourth [generations]' 
means the condemnation of falsities and the evils arising from them. 'And Moses made haste and bowed to the earth, and adored' means the reception at that time of what flowed into the outward form, 
and worship as a result of humility. 'And he said, If now I have found grace in Your eyes, O Lord' means because such an outward form was accepted. 'Let [my] Lord, I beg You, go in our midst' means 
in order that what is Divine may be inwardly present in it. 'For they are a stiff-necked people' means even though the Israelite nation does not accept what is Divine from an interior level. 'And pardon 
our iniquity and our sin' means being so in order that the things interiorly present within them, which teem with falsities and evils, may be shifted away. 'And make us Your inheritance' means in 
order that nevertheless the Church may exist there.
