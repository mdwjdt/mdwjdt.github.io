<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9256节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9256.</strong>“务必牵回来交给他”表教导和纠正。这从“牵回来”的含义清楚可知，“牵回来”当论及教会外那些处于不纯正的良善和真理之人时，是指教导和纠正；因为他们以这种方式被带回来。主在马太福音中的话也表示要向那些在教会之外的人行善：<br />你们听见有话说，当爱你的邻舍，恨你的仇敌。只是我告诉你们：要爱你们的仇敌，为咒诅你们的祝福，向恨恶你们的行善。你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有什么赏赐呢？你们若单请你弟兄的安，比人有什么长处呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.43.htm">5:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.47.htm">47</a>）<br />此处“仇敌”和“恨恶的”在灵义上表示那些对信之良善和真理持不同观念的人，一般表示那些在教会之外的人；犹太民族因将这些人视为仇敌，故被允许完全毁灭并杀害他们而不受惩罚。显然，“仇敌”在灵义上表示这些人，因为经上说：“你们若单请你弟兄的安，比人有什么长处呢？”事实上，凡从雅各生的人，因而凡在教会里的人都被称为“弟兄”。<br />至于那些在教会之外，被称为“外邦人”的人，他们的确受制于教义的虚假，但这是由于无知，因为他们没有圣言。然而，当接受教导时，他们对天堂生活拥有比基督徒更清晰、因而更内在的觉知。原因在于，他们不像许多基督徒那样坚定反对信之真理。因此，他们的内在人没有关闭，而是像小孩子那样容易向真理开放并接受真理。因为那些坚定反对信之真理和良善的人，如所有过着邪恶生活的人，将自己的内在人向上关闭，向下打开。<br />后果就是，他们的内在人只专注于下面的事物，也就是专注于外在人或属世人，并通过这外在人或属世人专注于存在于世上的事物，以及围绕其肉体和地上的事物。当情况是这样时，他们就向下看，也就是看向地狱。对这些人来说，内在人无法朝天堂打开，除非否认真理或肯定虚假、已经关闭它的事物被驱散；这些必须在这个世界上被逐出。若不通过生命的彻底翻转，因而历经多年，这一切是不可能实现的。因为虚假按顺序排列自己，从一个到另一个形成一个连续的链条；它们形成属世心智本身，以及它看待那些属于教会和天堂的事物的方式。正因如此，信和仁的一切事物，也就是教会或包含在圣言中的一切教义，以及总体上一切天上和神性的事物对这些人来说，都是幽暗；相反，尘世和世俗事物对他们来说却是光明。由此明显可知，摧毁这些人身上的虚假意味着摧毁他们所拥有的生命；他们若要拥有一种新生命，虚假必须逐渐被根除，真理和良善必须被植入以取代之。这些以同样的方式从一个到另一个形成一个连续的链条，并按顺序被排列。这就是生命的彻底翻转所表示的，这种翻转只能历经多年才能完成。因此，凡以为一个人能瞬间变新的人，都大错特错了。<br />但那些没有坚定反对信之良善和真理的人，如那些在教会之外，然而却照其宗教信仰活在某种信与仁之中的人，不会通过否定真理，确认违背基于圣言的信之真理的虚假而关闭他们的内在人。因此，这些人的内在能向上打开，也就是向天堂和主打开，即便在这个世上没有打开，在来世也会打开。到那时，他们从世上的生活所带来的一切尘世和世俗的观念同时被提升，好叫它们都能向上看。他们由此处于从主接受信之真理和仁之良善的状态，并充满聪明和智慧，从而被赋予永恒的幸福。这就是所有照其宗教信仰过一种良善生活之人的状况。因此，主的教会遍布全世界。但主在地上的教会就像天上的大人，其心肺就是存在圣言的地方，靠心肺存活的其它肢体和内脏则是不存在圣言的地方。<br />由此也可以看出为何总有一个新教会建立在教会之外的外邦民族当中（<a href="2986.htm">2986</a>，<a href="4747.htm">4747</a>节）；当旧教会向自己关闭天堂时，这一切就会发生，如前所述。正因如此，教会从犹太人被转移到外邦民族，而当今教会现在正被转移到外邦人。<br />教会被转移到承认主的外邦民族，这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，如下列经文，以赛亚书：<br />在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人有光照耀他们。你使这民族增多，加大他们的喜乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.3.htm">3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />到那日，耶西的根立作万民的大旗，外邦人必寻求祂，祂安息之所大有荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.10.htm">11:10</a>）<br /><br />我耶和华凭公义召你，必拉着你的手，保守你，立你作人民的约，作外邦人的光，开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐黑暗的出牢房。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>）<br /><br />看哪，我已立祂作万民的见证，为外邦人的首领和立法者。看哪，你素不认识的民族，你也必召来；素不认识你的民族，也必向你奔跑，都因耶和华你的神以色列的圣者。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.4.htm">55:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />列邦要走向你的光，列王要走向你升起的光辉。你向四围举目；他们都聚集来到你这里。你的众子从远方而来，你的众女也被保姆抱来你这边。那时，你看见就充足；你心又惊讶又扩张。因为大海的富绕必转向你，列邦的军队也必来到你这里。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.3.htm">60:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.5.htm">5</a>）<br />在路加福音，主出生后西面关于祂的预言：<br />我的眼睛已经看见神的救恩，就是你在万民面前所预备的，是启示外邦人的光。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.30.htm">2:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.32.htm">32</a>）<br />以主为主题的所有这些经文都声称，外邦民族要来到祂这里。当承认祂是他们的神时，他们就来归祂；令人惊奇的是，这些外邦民族敬拜以一个人的形式显现的独一神。因此，当认识主时，他们就接受并承认祂；一个新教会不可能建立在其他人当中。教会建立在这些民族当中，这一点从主在马太福音的话进一步明显看出来：<br />你们在经上没有念过，匠人所弃的石头，已作了房角的头块石头。所以我告诉你们，神的国，必从你们夺去，赐给那能结果子的民族。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.42.htm">21:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.43.htm">43</a>）<br />“石头”是指主（<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）；“匠人”是指那些属于教会的人。这些人将末后的，而外邦民族将是首先的，这一点从主在路加福音中的话明显看出来：<br />从东、从西、从北、从南将有人来，在神的国里坐席。看吧，必有末后的成了首先的，首先的成了末后的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.29.htm">13:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.30.htm">30</a>）</p>

Bringing back thou shalt bring it back to him. That this signifies instruction and amendment, is evident from the signification of "bringing back," when said of those outside the church who are in good 
and truth not genuine, as being to instruct and amend; for in this way they are brought back. That benefits ought to be imparted to those who are outside the church, is also meant by the Lord's words 
in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor; but I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, and benefit those who hate you. For if ye love those 
who love you, what reward have ye? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more? (Matt. 5:43-47); </p>
<p>here also by "enemies" and by "those who hate" are meant in the spiritual sense those who are 
at variance in respect to the goods and truths of faith, and in general those who are outside the church; because the Jewish nation considered these as enemies, whom they were permitted to utterly 
destroy, and to kill with impunity. That these are meant in the spiritual sense by "enemies," is plain, because it is said, "if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more?" for all were called "brethren" 
who were born of Jacob, thus who were within the church. [2] As further regards those who are outside the church, and are called "Gentiles," they are indeed in falsities of doctrine, but from 
ignorance, because they have not the Word; and yet when they are instructed they are in a clearer and consequently more inward perception about the heavenly life with man than are Christians. The reason 
is that they have not confirmed themselves against the truths of faith, as have very many Christians; and therefore their internal man is not closed, but, as with little children, is readily opened 
and receptive of truth. For those who have confirmed themselves against the truths and goods of faith, as do all who live an evil life, close in themselves the internal man above, and open it beneath. 
The result is that their internal man looks only at those things which are beneath, that is, into the external or natural man, and through this at the things in the world, and at those around their 
body and upon the earth; and when this is the case, they look downward, which is to look toward hell.  [3] With such persons the internal man cannot be opened toward heaven unless the things which deny 
truth, or affirm falsity, which have closed it, are dispersed; which must be done in this world. This cannot be effected except by a complete inversion of the life, thus the course of many years. For 
falsities arrange themselves in series, establishing a continuous connection among one another; and they form the natural mind itself, and its mode of viewing those things which are of the church and 
of heaven. From this it is that all things which are of faith and charity, that is, of the doctrine of the church, or of the Word, and in general all heavenly and Divine things, are thick darkness 
with such persons; and that on the other hand worldly and earthly things are light to them. From this it is plain that to destroy the falsities with such persons is to destroy their very life; and that 
if they are to have any new life, the falsities must be uprooted gradually, and truths and goods be implanted in their place, which will in like manner form a continuous connection with one another, 
and be arranged in series. This is meant by the "complete inversion of the life," which is possible only in the course of many years. Therefore he who believes that a man can be made new in a moment, 
is very much mistaken.  [4] But those who have not confirmed themselves against the goods and truths of faith-as is the case with those who are outside the church, and yet have lived in some kind of 
faith and charity according to their religion-have not been able to close the internal man in themselves by negations of truth, and by confirmations of falsity against the truth of faith from the Word; 
and therefore the internal of these persons is opened upward (that is, into heaven and toward the Lord), if not in this world, yet in the other life; and then all the earthly and worldly things they 
have brought with them from their life in the world, are at the same time uplifted so as together to look upward; whereby they are in a state to receive the truths of faith and the goods of charity 
from the Lord, and to become imbued with intelligence and wisdom, and thus to be endowed with eternal happiness. Such is the lot of all who have lived in good in accordance with their religion; and therefore 
the Lord's church is spread throughout the whole world. But the Lord's church itself on earth is like the Grand Man in the heavens, whose heart and lungs are where the Word is, and the rest of 
whose members and viscera, which live from the heart and the lungs, are where the Word is not. [5] From all this also it can be seen why a new church is always set up among the Gentiles who are outside 
the church (n. 2986, 4747), which as before said takes place when the old church has closed heaven against itself. For this reason the church was transferred from the Jewish people to the Gentiles, 
and the present church is also now being transferred to the Gentiles.  [6] That the church is transferred to the Gentiles who acknowledge the Lord, is evident from many passages in the Word, as from 
these which follow. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. Thou hast multiplied 
the nation, Thou hast made great their joy (Isa. 9:2, 3).      It shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, which standeth for an ensign of the peoples, shall the Gentiles seek; and 
His rest shall be glory (Isa. 11:10).      I Jehovah have called Thee in righteousness, and I will take hold of Thy hand, for I will keep Thee, and will give Thee for a covenant to the people, for 
a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the bound from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house (Isa. 42:6, 7).      Behold I have given Him for a witness 
to the peoples, a prince and lawgiver to the Gentiles. Behold thou shalt call a nation that thou hast not known, and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of Jehovah thy God, and 
for the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 55:4-5).      The Gentiles shall walk to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, they all gather themselves together, they 
come to thee; thy sons come from afar, and thy daughters are carried by nurses at thy side. Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall be amazed and be enlarged; because the multitude 
of the sea is converted unto thee, the armies of the Gentiles shall come (Isa. 60:3-5). And in the prophecy of Simeon concerning the Lord when a child: </p>
<p>     Mine eyes have seen the salvation 
of God, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; a light for the revelation of the Gentiles (Luke 2:30-32). [7] In all these passages the subject treated of is the Lord, in that the Gentiles 
shall come unto Him; and they come unto Him when they acknowledge Him as their God. And wonderful to say, the Gentiles worship the one only God under a human form; and therefore when they hear 
about the Lord, they receive and acknowledge Him; nor can a new church be set up with others. That the church is set up again with such, is further evident from the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Have 
ye not read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner. Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall 
be given to a nation that doeth the fruits (Matt. 21:42-43); </p>
<p>"the stone" denotes the Lord (n. 6426); "the builders" denote those who are of the church. That these would be last, and the Gentiles first, 
is thus said in Luke: </p>
<p>     They shall come from the east, and west, and from the north, and south, and shall recline at table in the kingdom of God. And behold there are last who shall be first, and 
there are first who shall be last (Luke 13:29-30). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9256</b></p><p><b>9256.</b>
'You shall surely bring it back to him' means teaching and correcting. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing back', when it refers to those outside the Church who are governed by unauthentic good 
and truth, as teaching and correcting; for this is how they are 'brought back'. Doing good to those outside the Church is also meant by the Lord's words in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
You have heard that it was said, 
You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you. For if you love those who love you, what reward have 
you? And if you salute only your brothers, what more are you doing [than others]? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:43-47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:43-47</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'enemies' and 'those who hate' in the spiritual sense mean those who have a different 
idea of what forms of good and the truths of faith are, in general those who are outside the Church, since the Jewish nation considered them to be adversaries whom they were allowed to consign to slaughter 
and to kill with impunity. It is evident that they are meant in the spiritual sense by 'enemies', since it says, 'If you salute only your brothers, what more are you doing [than others]?' For all 
were called brothers who were born of Jacob, thus who were within the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To enlarge on the subject of those outside the Church, called the gentiles, they are indeed subject to falsities 
in doctrine, which however is due to lack of knowledge because they do not possess the Word. Nevertheless when they have received instruction they have a clearer perception and consequently a more internal 
perception of what heavenly life means for a person than Christians have. The reason for this is that they have not set themselves firmly against the truths of faith as very many Christians have 
done. Consequently their internal man is not closed but is as it is with young children, open to and receptive of truth. For those who have set themselves firmly against the truths and forms of the 
good of faith, as all who lead an evil life do, close their internal man above and open it below.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As a result of this the attention of the internal man is focused solely on things below, that 
is, on the external or natural man, and through this on things that exist in the world, round about their body, and on this planet. And when this is so, they look downwards, that is, towards hell. With 
people like this the internal man cannot be opened towards heaven unless the negative rejections of truth or positive acceptances of falsity which have closed it are banished; and these must be banished 
while they are in the world. This cannot be accomplished except by a complete turning around of their life, thus over a number of years. For falsities line up in rows, make a continuous chain from 
one to another, and form the actual natural mind and the way it sees things that belong to the Church and to heaven. Consequently all matters of faith and charity, that is, everything taught by the 
Church or contained in the Word, in general everything heavenly and Divine is thick darkness to those people, and conversely everything worldly and earthly is light. From this it is evident that destroying 
falsities with such people means destroying the life they have, and that if they are to possess a new kind of life falsities must be gradually rooted out and truths and forms of good implanted 
instead. And these must in a similar way form a continuous chain from one to another and be lined up in rows. This is what is meant by a complete turning around of their life that cannot take place except 
over a number of years. Therefore anyone who imagines that a person can be made new in an instant is much mistaken.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But those who have not set themselves firmly against the forms of good 
and the truths of faith - those for instance who are outside the Church and yet have lived in some kind of faith and charity in accord with their religion - have not been able to close their internal 
man through negative rejections of truth and positive acceptances of falsity that are contrary to the truth of faith founded on the Word. Therefore also - if not in the world, nevertheless in the next 
life - their internal can be opened above, that is, in the direction of heaven and of the Lord. And at the same time all the earthly and worldly ideas they have brought with them from their life in the 
world are raised up, in order that they may all look upwards together. These then bring them into a condition to receive the truths of faith from the Lord and forms of the good of charity, to have 
intelligence and wisdom conferred on them, and so to be endowed with eternal happiness. Such is the condition of all who lead a good life in accord with their religion. For this reason the Lord's Church 
is spread throughout the whole world. But the Lord's Church on earth is like the Grand Man in heaven, whose heart and lungs are where the Word exists, and the remaining members and internal organs, 
which depend for their life on the heart and lungs, are where the Word does not exist.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 All this also goes to show why it is that a new Church is always established among gentile nations who are 
outside the Church, <a href="2986.htm">2986</a>, <a href="4747.htm">4747</a>, which takes place when the old Church has closed heaven to itself, as stated above. So it is that the Church was transferred from the Jewish people to gentile nations, 
and also that the Church at the present day is now being transferred to gentiles. </p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that the Church is transferred to gentile nations who acknowledge the Lord is clear from very many places 
in the Word, such as the following: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shone out. You 
have multiplied the nation; for them You have made joy great. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:2, 3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on that day, that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, which is standing as 
an ensign of the peoples; and His rest will be glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
I Jehovah have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, because I will guard You, and give You 
to be a covenant of the people,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> a light of the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring the bound out of prison, out of the dungeon-house those who sit in darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:6, 7</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Nations will walk to Your light, and kings to the brightness of Your rising. Lift up Your 
eyes round about; they all gather together and they come towards You. Your sons come from far, and Your daughters are carried at the side by nurses. Then You will see and abound, and Your heart will 
be astounded and enlarge itself because the abundance of the sea will be turned to You, the armies of the nations will come to You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:3-5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Simeon's prophecy regarding the Lord after His 
birth, in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
My eyes have seen Your<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all peoples, a light for revelation to the gentiles.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%202:30-32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 2:30-32</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 All these places, in 
which the Lord is the subject, declare that gentile nations will come to Him. They come to Him when they acknowledge Him as their God; and what is amazing, such nations worship the one and only God manifested 
in human form. When therefore they learn about the Lord they receive and acknowledge Him; and a new Church cannot be established among any others. The fact that the Church is established among 
such nations is further evident from the following words that are the Lord's, in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Have you not read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has become the corner-stone?<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> 
Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits [of it]. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:42,%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21:42, 43</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The stone' is the Lord, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, 'the builders' are those 
who belong to the Church. And the fact that these will be last and the gentile nations first is evident from His words in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will come from the east and the west, and from the north and 
the south, reclining in the kingdom of God. And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:29, 30</a>.

et emendare, nam sic reducuntur.  Quod benefaciendum sit illis qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, etiam intelligitur per Domini verba apud Matthaeum, Audivistis quod dictum sit, Amabis proximum tuum, et 
odio habebis inimicum tuum; Ego vero dico vobis, Amate inimicos vestros, benedicite maledicentibus vobis, benefacite odio vos habentibus; nam si amaveritis amantes vos, quid praemium habetis? et si salutatis 
fratres vestros tantum, quid abundantius facitis? [v]43-47; </p>
<p>etiam hic per `inimicos' et per `odio habentes' in sensu spirituali intelliguntur qui dissident quoad {1}bona et vera fidei, in genere 
illi qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, quoniam gens Judaica illos considerabat ut hostes, quos internecioni dare et impune occidere liceret; quod illi in sensu spirituali per `inimicos' intelligantur, patet, 
quia dicitur, `si salutatis fratres vestros tantum, quid abundantius facitis?' fratres enim vocati sunt omnes qui a Jacobo nati sunt, ita qui intra Ecclesiam erant. Quod illos qui extra Ecclesiam 
sunt et gentes vocantur, porro 2 concernit, in falsis quidem doctrinae sunt sed ex ignorantia quia non habent Verbum, at usque cum instructi, in perceptione clariore sunt et inde in {2}perceptione interiore 
de caelesti vita apud hominem quam Christiani; causa est quia non confirmaverunt se contra vera fidei sicut (x)perplures Christiani; quapropter internus (c)illorum homo non est clausus, sed est, 
sicut {3}apud infantes, apertilis et receptibilis veri; nam qui confirmaverunt se contra vera et bona fidei, ut faciunt omnes illi qui male vivunt, illi apud se claudunt internum hominem supra et aperiunt 
infra, unde internus eorum homo spectat modo illa quae infra sunt, hoc est, in externum seu naturalem hominem, et per illum in ea quae in mundo sunt, et in ea quae circum corpus suum et quae super 
tellure; et cum ita, spectant deorsum, quod est versus infernum; apud tales internus homo versus caelum aperiri non potest nisi discutiantur 3 negativa veri seu affirmativa falsi quae clauserunt, 
quae discutienda sunt in mundo; quod non {4}fieri potest nisi per inversionem vitae totalem, ita per plures annos; nam falsa per series se disponunt, et nexum {5}inter se continuum faciunt, et formant 
ipsam mentem naturalem et ejus intuitionem quoad illa quae Ecclesiae et caeli sunt; inde est quod omnia quae fidei et charitatis sunt, hoc est, quae doctrinae Ecclesiae {6}seu quae Verbi, in communi 
omnia caelestia et Divina, illis caligo sint, et vicissim mundana et terrestria illis lux; (m)inde patet quod {7}destruere falsa apud tales sit destruere ipsam vitam, et si illis novum vitae erit, quod 
falsa successive exstirpanda sint et loco eorum implantanda vera et bona quae similiter continuum nexum inter se formabunt, ac in series disponentur; hoc intelligitur per inversionem vitae totalem 
quae non nisi quam per plures annos dari potest {8}; quare qui (x)credit quod homo momento fieri possit novus, valde fallitur.(n) At qui se non confirmaverunt contra bona et vera fidei, sicut illi 4 
qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, et tamen in quadam specie fidei et charitatis secundum suum religiosum vixerunt, illi non potuerunt per negativa veri ac per confirmativa falsi contra verum fidei ex Verbo apud 
se internum hominem claudere, quapropter etiam, si non in mundo, usque in altera vita, aperitur eorum internum supra, quod est in caelum et ad Dominum, et tunc simul omnia terrestria et mundana quae 
secum a vita in mundo traxerunt elevantur, ut simul spectent sursum; per quae in statu sunt recipere vera fidei et bona charitatis a Domino, ac imbui intelligentia et sapientia, et sic donari felicitate 
aeterna; talis sors est omnium qui secundum religiosum suum in bono vixerunt; quapropter Ecclesia Domini est per universum orbem sparsa; sed ipsa Ecclesia Domini in terris se habet sicut Maximus 
Homo in caelis, cujus cor et pulmo est ubi Verbum, (c)ac reliqua membra et viscera, quae a corde et pulmone vivunt, sunt ubi non {9} Verbum. 5 Ex his quoque constare potest unde est cur nova Ecclesia 
semper apud gentes quae extra Ecclesiam sunt instauretur, n. 2986, 4747, quod fit quando vetus Ecclesia clausit sibi caelum, ut supra dictum est; inde est quod Ecclesia a populo Judaico translata sit 
ad gentes, et quoque quod hodierna Ecclesia etiam ad gentes nunc transferatur. Quod Ecclesia ad gentes quae agnoscunt Dominum transferatur, {10}constat a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut ab his sequentibus: 
apud Esaiam, Populus ambulantes in tenebris {11}viderunt lucem magnam; habitantes in terra umbrae mortis, lux effulsit super eos; multiplicasti gentem, illi magnum reddidisti gaudium, ix 1, 2 [A. 
V. 2, 3]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Fiet in die illo, (x)radicem Jischaji, quae stans in signum populorum, gentes quaerent, et erit quies Ipsius gloria, xi 20: </p>
<p>6 apud eundem, Ego Jehovah vocavi Te in justitia, 
et apprehendam manum Tuam, quia custodiam Te, et dabo Te in foedus populo, in lucem gentium, ad aperiendum oculos caecos, ad educendum {12}e carcere vinctum, e domo claustri sedentes in tenebris, xlii 
6, 7: </p>
<p>apud eundem, En testem populis dedi Ipsum, Principem et Legislatorem gentibus; en gentem, non novisti, vocabis, et gens, non noverant Te, ad Te current, propter Jehovam Deum Tuum, et ob Sanctum 
Israelis, lv 4, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Ambulabunt gentes ad lucem Tuam, et reges ad splendorem ortus Tui; attolle circumcirca oculos Tuos, omnes congregantur, veniunt ad Te; filii tui e longinquo veniunt, 
et filiae Tuae ad latus a nutricibus apportantur; tunc videbis et afflues, et stupebit et dilatabit se cor tuum, quod convertatur ad Te multitudo maris, exercitus gentium venient ad Te, lx 3-5: </p>
<p>(m)in 
prophetia Simeonis de Domino nato, apud Lucam, Viderunt oculi mei salutare Dei, quod praeparasti ante faciem omnium populorum, lumen in revelationem gentium, ii 30-32.(n) In omnibus illis locis 
agitur de Domino quod gentes ad Ipsum 7 venturae sint; et ad Ipsum veniunt cum Ipsum agnoscunt pro suo Deo; et quod mirum, gentes adorant unicum Deum sub (t)forma humana; quapropter cum audiunt de Domino, 
recipiunt Ipsum et agnoscunt; nova Ecclesia nec apud alios instaurari potest.  Quod apud tales Ecclesia instauretur, patet porro a Domini verbis, apud Matthaeum, Annon legistis in scripturis, Lapidem 
quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic factus est in caput anguli? ideo dico vobis, Auferetur a vobis regnum Dei et dabitur genti facienti fructus, xxi 42, 43; </p>
<p>`lapis' est Dominus, n. 6426, `aedificantes' 
sunt qui ab Ecclesia; quod hi ultimi erunt, et gentes primi, apud Lucam, Venient ab ortibus et occasibus, et a septentrione et meridie, accumbentes in regno Dei, et ecce sunt {13}extremi qui 
erunt primi, et sunt primi qui erunt {13}ultimi, xiii 29, 30. </p>
