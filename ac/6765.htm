<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6765节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6765.</strong>“就对那凶恶的人说，你为什么打你的同伴呢”表责备，因为一个人想要毁灭另一个人的信。这从“凶恶的人”、“打”和“同伴”的含义清楚可知：“凶恶的人”是指那些并不支持信之真理，然而却在教会里的人，因为教会里既有那些支持信之真理的人，也有那些不支持的人，这从各种异端可以看出来，“凶恶的人”在此表示那些赞成异端邪说，或不支持信之真理的人；“打”是指毁灭（参看<a href="6758.htm">6758</a>节）；“同伴”是指支持信之真理的人。因为当“凶恶的人”表示不支持信之真理的人时，“同伴”就表示支持信之真理的人。他之所以被称为“同伴”，而不是“弟兄”，尽管他们两个人都是希伯来人，是因为他们彼此敌对。所指的是一种责备，这是显而易见的。此中情形是这样：当一个人正在重生时，他被送入与虚假的争战中。在此期间，主将他保持在真理中，不过，是保持在他确信为真理的真理中；他利用这真理与虚假争战。他甚至能利用并非纯正真理的真理争战，只要这真理能以某种方式与良善联结。它通过纯真与良善联结，因为纯真是能实现这种联结的方法。这解释了为何人们能在教会里通过任何教义重生；不过，那些拥有纯正真理的人比其他人更有优势。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6765</b></p><p><b>6765.</b>
And he said to the wicked one, Wherefore smitest thou thy companion? That this signifies rebuke because one desired to destroy the faith of another, is evident from the signification of "the wicked one," 
as being those who are not in the truth of faith, but are nevertheless within the church, for there are within the church those who are in the truth of faith, and there are those who are not in truth, 
as can be seen from various heresies, and those who are in heresy, or not in the truth of faith, are here meant by "the wicked one;" from the signification of "smiting," as being to destroy (see 
n. 6758); and from the signification of "companion," as being one who is in the truth of faith.  For when by "the wicked one" is signified one who is not in the truth of faith, by "companion" is signified 
one who is in the truth of faith. He is called "companion," not "brother," although both were Hebrews, because they were foes. That rebuke is meant is evident. The case herein is this. When a man 
is being regenerated, he is let into combats against falsities, and is then kept by the Lord in truth, but in that truth which he had persuaded himself to be truth, and from this truth he fights against 
falsity. He can fight also from truth not genuine, provided the truth is such that in some way it can be conjoined with good; and it is conjoined with good by means of innocence, for innocence is 
the means of conjunction. Hence it is that men can be regenerated within the church from any doctrine, but those preeminently who are in genuine truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6765</b></p><p><b>6765.</b>
'And he said to the one in the wrong, Why are you striking your companion?' means a rebuke, deploring that one person should wish to destroy another's faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'the one 
in the wrong' as a person who does not uphold the truth of faith and yet is within the Church (for within the Church there are those who uphold the truth of faith and there are those who do not, as 
the existence of various heresies goes to prove; and those who subscribe to heresy, that is, who do not uphold the truth of faith, are meant here by 'the one in the wrong'); from the meaning of 'striking' 
as destroying, as above in <a href="6758.htm">6758</a>; and from the meaning of 'companion' as a person who upholds the truth of faith. For when 'the one in the wrong' means a person who does not uphold the truth of faith, 
'companion' means one who does uphold it. The word 'companion' is used, not 'brother', even though both of them were Hebrews, because they were hostile to each other. The fact that this is a rebuke 
is self-evident. What all this implies is that when a person is being regenerated he is sent into battles against falsities. During these the Lord maintains him in truth, but in what he has convinced 
himself to be the truth; and this is what is used in the battles against falsity. Even that which is not the real truth can be used, provided that it is such as can in some way be joined to good. And 
it is joined to good through innocence, for innocence is the means which enables that conjunction to be effected. This explains why people within the Church who have accepted any teaching whatever 
can be regenerated, though those who are in possession of real truths are in a better position than others. </p>

</p><b>6765.</b>
`Et dixit improbo, Quare percutis socium tuum?': quod significet increpationem quod unus alterius fidem destruere vellet, constat ex significatione `improbi' quod sit qui non in vero fidei sed usque 
intra Ecclesiam; sunt enim intra Ecclesiam qui in vero fidei et sunt qui non in vero, ut constare potest ex variis haeresibus; qui in haeresi, seu in non vero fidei sunt, hic intelliguntur per `improbum'; 
ex significatione `percutere' quod sit destruere, {1}ut supra n. 6758; et ex significatione `socii' quod sit qui in vero fidei; cum enim per `improbum' significatur qui in non vero fidei, per `socium' 
significatur qui in vero fidei; `socius' dicitur, non `frater,' tametsi uterque Hebraeus {2}, quia inimici; quod increpatio sit patet.  Cum his ita se habet: cum regeneratur homo, mittitur in pugnas 
contra falsa, et tunc tenetur a Domino in vero, sed {3}in illo vero quod sibi persuaserat verum esse, ex hoc vero pugnatur contra falsum; ex vero non genuino etiam pugnari potest, modo (t)sit tale 
ut conjungi aliquo modo possit cum bono, et conjungitur cum bono per innocentiam, nam innocentia est medium conjunctionis; inde est quod regenerari queant intra Ecclesiam ex quacumque doctrina, sed 
illi prae aliis qui in veris genuinis sunt. 	@1 de qua$ 	@2 i erat$ 	@3 non ita in vero genuino, sed in$ </p>
