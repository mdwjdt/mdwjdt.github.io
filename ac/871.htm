<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>871.</strong>“他又从他自己那里放出一只鸽子要看看”表接受信之真理与良善的状态。这一点从事物的联系，以及下文清楚可知。下文论述了在重生期间，这个人经历试探后的三个状态，也就是“他三次放出鸽子”所表示的。从字面上看，这些话几乎是在说他进行了调查，因为经上说 “他又从他自己那里放出一只鸽子”，“要看看水从土地面上减退没有”，即看看虚假是否依旧如此强大，以致信之良善与真理无法被接受。然而，对主而言，由于祂知道每一个事物，故无需调查。所以，这些话的内义不是指调查，而是指一种状态，此处是第一状态，这时，虚假仍是一个障碍。这类虚假用“水减退没有”来表示。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]871.</strong> The symbolism of he sent a dove out from him to see as the right conditions for taking in faith's truth and goodness becomes clear from the series of ideas. It can also be deduced from the ensuing treatment of the three stages of regeneration{*1} that follow times of trial for the people being discussed. The three times the dove was sent out symbolize those three stages.<br />The words here most directly involve an examination of those people, since it says that Noah sent the dove out from him to see specifically (as comes next) whether the water might have lessened. The question posed by these words was whether falsity was still so overwhelming that they could not accept the truth and goodness of faith. But the Lord has no use for investigation, since he knows absolutely everything, so at a deeper level, the words symbolize not an examination but prevailing conditions. Here they mean the first stage, when falsity still got in the way, as symbolized by the words whether the water had lessened.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The three stages that Swedenborg mentions here are a subdivision of the second state following times of trial.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 871</b></p><p><b>871.</b>
And he sent forth a dove from him to see. That this signifies a state of receiving the truths and goods of faith, is evident from the connection of the things, as also from what follows, where the three 
states of the regeneration of this man after temptations are treated of, which are signified by his sending forth the dove three times. Here the words proximately involve his exploration; for it is 
said that he "sent forth the dove from him to see" namely, whether the waters were abated; that is, whether the falsities were still so abundant that goods and truths could not be received. But with 
the Lord there is no exploration, because He knows all things both in general and in particular. In the internal sense therefore, the words signify, not exploration, but state, and here the first state, 
when falsities were still hindering, which is signified by the words, "whether the waters were abated." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 871</b></p><p><b>871.</b>
'He sent out a dove from himself to see' means a state of receiving the truths and good of faith. This becomes clear from the train of thought and also from what follows, where the subject is the three 
states following temptations in the regeneration of this man, states meant by his sending out the dove three times. Taken almost literally these words imply that he made investigations, for it is said 
that he sent out the dove from himself 'to see', that is to say, as the phrase following shows, to see 'whether the waters had abated', which was seeing whether the falsities were still so great that 
goods and truths of faith could not be received. With the Lord however, because He knows every single thing, no such investigation is necessary. Consequently these words in the internal sense do not 
mean an investigation but a state, here a first state when falsities were still a hindrance. Such falsities are meant by the words 'whether the waters had abated'. </p>

</p><b>871.</b>
'Quod emiserit columbam a secum ad videndum': quod significent statum recipiendi vera et bona fidei, constare a serie rerum, tum a sequentibus, potest, ubi de tribus statibus regenerationis hujus hominis 
post tentationes agitur, significatis per quod 'ter' emiserit columbam: hic proxime involvunt verba explorationem ejus, nam dicitur quod emiserit columbam a secum 'ad videndum,' nempe, ut sequitur, 
'num diminutae sint aquae,' hoc est, num falsitates adhuc tantae essent ut bona et vera fidei recipi possent {1}; sed exploratio nulla est apud Dominum, quia omnia et singula novit; quare in sensu 
interno non significant explorationem, sed statum, et hic primum statum, quando adhuc falsitates impedirent, quae significantur per verba 'num diminutae sint aquae.' 	@1 T. i non, but this seems unnecessary, 
for tantae means of such measure, either great or small.$ </p>
