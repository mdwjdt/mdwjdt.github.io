<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3167节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3167.</strong>“和她母亲”表也进入属世真理，也就是说，属灵之物从理性进入属世真理，就像进入属世良善一样，如刚才所述。这从“母亲”的含义清楚可知，“母亲”是指教会，教会凭真理被称为“母亲”（参看<a href="289.htm">289</a>，<a href="2717.htm">2717</a>节）。为让人们了解属灵之物如何因真理被引入理性中的良善而进入属世良善和属世真理，有必要在此给予简要描述。每个人都有一个内在和一个外在，他的内在被称为内在人，他的外在被称为外在人。但很少有人知道何为内在人，何为外在人。内在人和属灵人是一回事，外在人和属世人是一回事。属灵人依赖于在属于天堂之光事物上的理解力和智慧，而属世人则依赖于在属于尘世之光事物上的理解力和智慧（关于这两种光，参看<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>节）。因为在天堂，除了属灵之物外，无物存在；而在尘世，除了属世之物外无物存在。人以这种方式受造：他里面的属灵之物和属世之物，也就是他的属灵人和属世人彼此一致，或构成一体。不过，在这种情况下，属灵人应掌控属世人里面的一切事物，而属世人则应顺从，如同仆人顺从他的主人。<br />但属世人因堕落而开始将自己高举到属灵人之上，从而颠倒神序本身。结果，属世人脱离属灵人，并且除了诸如那种仿佛透过缝隙进入，赋予思考和言谈能力的属灵之物外，不再拥有任何属灵之物。这属世人必须被主重生，好让属灵之物再度流入它里面；也就是说，出于属世人的真理必须被引入理性中的良善，并在那里与其联结。当这种情况发生后，属灵之物便得以进入属世人，因为此时天堂之光流入和启示属世人里面的事物，并使它们接受光。那里的良善接受这光所传递的热，也就是爱和仁；而真理接受光线，也就是信。属世良善和属世真理正是以这种方式接受属灵之物。在这种情况下，属世良善就是从以服务属灵人，因而服务邻人，尤其服务自己的国家，更尤其服务主的国度，最重要的是服务主为目的而来的一切快乐和愉悦。而属世真理则是以智慧，即行出这些事为目的的一切教义和记忆知识。</p>

And to her mother. That this signifies for natural truth also (namely, that it thence has spiritual things, as is the case with natural good, concerning which see just above) is evident from the signification 
of "mother," as being the church, which is called "mother" from truth (see n. 289, 2717). In order that it may be known how it is that natural good and natural truth have spiritual things from 
the fact that truth is initiated into good in the rational, this may be briefly explained. Every man has an internal and an external; his internal is called the internal man, and his external the external 
man; but what the internal man is, and what the external, is known to few. The internal man is the same as the spiritual man, and the external is the same as the natural man; the spiritual man 
is that which understands and is wise from those things which are of the light of heaven, but the natural man from those things which are of the light of the world (concerning which two lights see above, 
n. 3138). For in heaven there are nothing but spiritual things, whereas in the world there are nothing but natural things. Man has been so created that in him spiritual things and natural things, 
that is, his spiritual and natural man, should agree or make a one; but in this case the spiritual man ought to dispose all things in the natural, and the natural ought to obey, as a servant his lord. [2] 
But by the fall the natural man began to exalt itself above the spiritual man, and thus inverted Divine order itself; hence the natural man separated itself from the spiritual, and no longer possessed 
any spiritual things, except such as could enter as through chinks, and confer the capacity of thinking and speaking. But in order that spiritual things might again flow into the natural man, 
this had to be regenerated by the Lord; that is, truth out of the natural man must be initiated and conjoined with good in the rational; and when this is effected, spiritual things come to the natural 
man, for then the light of heaven flows in and enlightens the things in the natural man, and causes them to receive light; the goods therein the heat of light, that is, love and charity; and the truth 
the rays of light, that is, faith; and in this way natural good and natural truth receive spiritual things. In this case natural good is all the delight and pleasure that come from having as an end 
the being of service to what is spiritual, thus to the neighbor, still more to the public weal, and still more to the Lord's kingdom, and above all to the Lord; and natural truth is all the doctrine and 
memory-knowledge that has as an end to be wise, that is, the doing of these things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3167</b></p><p><b>3167.</b>
'And to [her] mother' means to natural truth also, that is to say, spiritual things passed from the rational to it, even as they passed to natural good, dealt with just above. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'a mother' as the Church, which by virtue of truth is called 'a mother', dealt with in <a href="289.htm">289</a>, <a href="2717.htm">2717</a>. So that people may know how spiritual things pass to natural good and to natural truth as a 
result of truth being introduced into good in the rational, a brief description must be given here. Everyone has an internal and an external, his internal being called the internal man, and his external 
the external man. But few know what the internal man is and what the external. The internal man is one and the same as the spiritual man, and the external man one and the same as the natural man. 
The spiritual man depends for understanding and wisdom on things that belong to the light of heaven, whereas the natural depends for its understanding and wisdom on things that belong to the light of 
the world. Regarding those two kinds of light, see <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>. For in heaven none but spiritual things exist, whereas in the world none but natural exist. The human being was created in such a way that in him 
spiritual things and natural things, that is, his spiritual man and his natural man, should accord with each other or make one. But in that case the spiritual man ought to have control over the things 
in the natural, and the natural man ought to obey, like a servant his master. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Through the Fall however the natural man started to raise itself above the spiritual man and so turn Divine order 
itself upside down. As a consequence the natural man separated itself from the spiritual, and spiritual things could not reach it any longer except so to speak through chinks to provide the ability 
to think and speak. But so that spiritual things might flow in once more into the natural man this had to be regenerated by the Lord, that is, truth from the natural man had to be introduced and joined 
to good in the rational. When this happens spiritual things have access to the natural man, for now the light of heaven flows in and illuminates things in the natural man, and causes what is there 
to receive light. The goods there receive the warmth that the light conveys, which is love and charity, whereas the truth receives rays of light, which is faith. It is in this way that spiritual things 
pass from the rational into natural good and truth. Natural good in that case consists in all the delight and satisfaction gained from having service to the spiritual man as the end in view, and so 
service to the neighbour, more so to one's country, more so still to the Lord's kingdom, and above all to the Lord. And natural truth consists in all doctrinal teaching and factual knowledge which have 
wisdom, that is, the performance of those things, as the end in view. </p>

`Et matri': quod significet etiam vero naturali, nempe spiritualia inde, sicut bono naturali, de quo mox supra, constat ex significatione `matris' quod sit Ecclesia, quae ex vero `mater' dicitur, de 
qua n. 289, 2717. Ut sciatur quomodo se habet quod spiritualia bono naturali et vero naturali inde quod verum initiatur bono in rationali, paucis dicendum:  unicuique homini est internum et externum, 
ejus internum vocatur internus homo, et ejus externum externus homo; sed quid internus homo et externus, paucis notum est; internus homo est idem ac spiritualis homo, (c)ac externus est idem ac naturalis 
homo: spiritualis homo est qui intelligit et sapit ex illis quae sunt lucis caeli, naturalis autem ex illis quae sunt lucis mundi; de utraque luce videatur n. 3138; in caelo enim non sunt nisi quam 
spiritualia, in mundo autem non nisi quam naturalia; homo ita creatus est ut spiritualia et naturalia in illo, hoc est, spiritualis et naturalis ejus homo concordarent seu unum facerent, sed tunc spiritualis 
homo deberet disponere omnia in naturali, ac naturalis oboedire, sicut servus suo domino; [2] sed per lapsum naturalis homo coepit se extollere supra spiritualem, ita invertit ipsum ordinem 
Divinum, exinde naturalis homo separavit se a spirituali, nec magis spiritualia ei {1}quam quae {2}intrare possent quasi per rimas, et {3}dare facultatem cogitandi et loquendi: ut autem spiritualia influerent 
iterum in naturalem hominem, regenerandus erat a Domino, hoc est, verum e naturali homine initiandum et conjungendum bono in rationali; quod cum fit, {4}naturali homini accedunt spiritualia, 
influit enim tunc lux caeli, ac illustrat illa quae in naturali homine, et facit ut quae ibi, recipiant lucem, bona ibi calorem lucis, hoc est, amorem et charitatem, verum autem radios lucis, hoc est, 
fidem; {5}ita sunt bono naturali et vero naturali spiritualia inde. Bonum naturale est tunc omne jucundum et volupe ex fine inserviendi spirituali, ita proximo, magis reipublicae, adhuc magis regno 
Domini, {6}et super omnia Domino; et verum naturale est omne doctrinale et scientificum propter finem sapiendi, hoc est, faciendi illa. @1 nisi$  @2 intrarerint$  @3 darent ei$  @4 i tunc$ @5 inde$
