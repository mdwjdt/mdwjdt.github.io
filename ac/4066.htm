<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4066节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4066.</strong>“雅各见拉班的脸色”表当“雅各”所表良善离开时，那良善所具有的状态的改变。这从“雅各”和“拉班”的代表，以及“脸”的含义清楚可知：“雅各”是指属世层的良善；“拉班”是指居间良善，如前面频繁所述；“脸”是指内层或内在（<a href="358.htm">358</a>，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2434.htm">2434</a>，<a href="3527.htm">3527</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>节），在此是指内层或内在的改变，或也可说，状态的改变；因为经上说“雅各见拉班的脸色，看哪，向他不如从前了”。在圣言中，“脸”之所以表示内层或内在，是因为内层或内在从脸上闪耀出来，将自己呈现在脸上，如同呈现在一面镜子或一个形像中；所以，“脸”或面部表情表示人的思维状态和情感状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4066</b></p><p><b>4066.</b>
And Jacob saw the faces of Laban. That this signifies a change of state with that good when the good meant by "Jacob" receded, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural, 
and from the representation of Laban, as being mediate good (concerning which frequently above); and from the signification of "faces," as being the interiors (n. 358, 1999, 2434, 3527, 3573), 
here, changes of the interiors, or what is the same, changes of state; for it is said, "he saw his faces, and behold he was not at all with him as yesterday and the day before." The reason why in the 
Word the interiors are signified by "face," is that the interiors shine forth from the face, and present themselves in the face as in a mirror, or in an image; and hence the faces or countenance signifies 
states of the thoughts and states of the affections. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4066</b></p><p><b>4066.</b>
'And Jacob saw Laban's face' means a change of state with that good when the good meant by Jacob was departing from it. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the good of the Natural, and 
from the representation of 'Laban' as intermediate good, both of which have often been dealt with already; and from the meaning of 'the face' as things that are interior, <a href="358.htm">358</a>, <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2434.htm">2434</a>, <a href="3527.htm">3527</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, 
in this case as changes of such interiors, or what amounts to the same, changes of state, for it is said that he saw his face 'and behold, he was not at all friendly towards him as before'. The reason 
why in the Word the things that are interior are meant by 'the face' is that those things shine out of a person's face, and present themselves in his face as in a mirror or in an image; and so 'the 
face' or the countenance means the states in which a person's thoughts and those in which his affections reside. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4066</b>
</p><b>4066.</b>
`Et vidit Jacob facies Labanis': quod significet status mutationem apud bonum illud cum recederet bonum per `Jacob' intellectum, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum Naturalis, et 
a repraesentatione `Labanis' quod sit hortum medium, de quibus saepius prius; et a significatione `facierum' quod sint interiora, de qua n. 358, 1999, 2434, 3527, 3573, hic mutationes interiorum, seu 
quod idem, mutationes status; dicitur enim, vidit facies ejus, et ecce nullatenus is cum eo sicut heri nudius tertius.' Causa quod interiora per `facies' in Verbo significentur, est quia interiora 
elucent ex facie, et se sistunt in facie sicut in speculo aut in imagine, inde `facies' seu vultus significant status cogitationum et status affectionum. </p>
