<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1735.</strong>“至高的神是应当称颂的”表主的内在人。这从刚才有关“内在人”的论述清楚可知。在古教会，耶和华被称为“至高神”，因为“高”代表并因而表示内在之物，故“至高”表至内在之物。这就是为何古教会在高处、大山小山进行敬拜的原因。而且，至内层相对于外层和最外层，恰似至高者相对于较低者和最低者。至高者或至内层是爱的属天元素，或爱本身。耶和华或主的内在人是爱的属天元素本身，也就是说，是爱本身。除了对全人类的纯然之爱，因而纯然怜悯的属性外，其它任何属性都不适合它。怜悯的性质是，它愿意拯救所有人，使他们永远幸福，将它自己所有的都赐给他们，因而出于纯然的怜悯、凭借爱的大能将所有愿意跟随的人引向天堂，即引向它自己。这爱本身就是耶和华。<br />自有（Am）或本有（Is）唯独适合主，不适合其它任何事物。一切生命的本有（存在），即生命本身皆源于这爱。因为本有存在于爱里面，就是爱本身。并且，由于唯独耶和华是生命的本有（存在），或生命本身，因为唯独祂是爱，故每一个事物都通过祂而有其本有（存在）和生命。除了唯独耶和华，即唯独主外，没人能靠自己存在和活着。因为除了唯独主外，没人能靠自己存在和活着，所以人们觉得自己靠自己活着，只是一个错觉。天使清楚发觉，他们不是靠自己活着，而是靠主，他们活在主生命的本有（存在）中，因为他们居于祂的爱中。然而，对他们而言，貌似靠自己活着的表象，连同无法形容的幸福比其他所有人都要强烈。因此，这就是活在主里面的意思。若非活在祂的爱里面，即活在对邻舍的仁爱里面，这是不可能的事。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1735.</strong> The symbolism of a blessing on God the Highest as the Lord's inner self can be seen from the remarks about his inner self just above.<br />Jehovah was called God the Highest in the ancient church because height represented and therefore symbolized inner depth, so that the Highest meant the deepest within. That is why the ancient church worshiped on heights, mountains, and hills. The relationship of the deepest level within to the shallower and shallowest levels is exactly like that of the highest to the lower and lowest. The highest level, or the deepest level within, is heavenly love, or love itself; Jehovah (the Lord's inner level) was the most heavenly love, or love itself. There is no adequate way to describe him except in terms of pure love and so in terms of pure mercy toward the whole human race. That mercy is his desire to save everyone, to make everyone happy forever, and to give us everything he has. Anyone who is willing to follow is someone he wishes to draw toward heaven, or in other words, toward himself, out of pure mercy, by the powerful force of love.<br />[2] This "love itself" is Jehovah. No other entity but love can be described as being the I Am, or as having independent existence. The essential reality of all life — life itself, in other words — comes from this love because it is innate in love, is integral to love itself. Because Jehovah alone is the essential reality of life (is life itself), since he alone is love, absolutely everything has its reality and its life from him. Not a single person has the capacity for independent existence or life but Jehovah alone, that is, the Lord alone. And since no one has independent existence or life but the Lord alone, the fact that we seem to ourselves to live independently is an illusion of the senses. Angels perceive clearly that life is generated not by themselves but by the Lord, because living as they do in the Lord's love, they live in the essential reality of his life. Even so, the appearance of independent life is granted to them more than to anyone else, along with happiness beyond words.<br />This, then, is to live in the Lord, which we cannot do in the least if we do not live in his love — that is, in charity for our neighbor. </p>

Blessed be God Most High. That this signifies the Lord's internal man, is evident from the things which were said just above concerning the internal man. In the Ancient Church, Jehovah was called "God 
Most High" for the reason that "height" represented and therefore signified what is internal, and thus "the Most High" signified what is inmost. Hence the worship of the Ancient Church was upon high 
places, mountains, and hills. The inmost also has the same relation to the exterior and the outermost, as the highest bears to the lower and the lowest. The Most High or the Inmost is the Celestial of 
Love, or Love, itself. Jehovah, or the Lord's internal man, was the very Celestial of Love, that is, Love itself, to which no other attributes are fitting than those of pure Love, thus of pure Mercy 
toward the whole human race which is such that it wills to save all and make them happy to eternity, and to bestow on them all that it has; thus out of pure mercy to draw all who are willing to follow, 
to heaven, that is, to itself, by the strong force of love. This Love itself is Jehovah.  [2] Of nothing can Am or Is be predicated except of Love. From this Love-because in Love, or of Love itself-is 
the very Being [Esse] of all life, that is, Life itself; and because Jehovah alone is Being of life, or Life itself, as He alone is Love, each and all things have thence their being and their life; 
nor can anyone be and live of himself except Jehovah alone, that is, the Lord alone; and as no one can be and live of himself except the Lord alone, it is a fallacy of sense that men seem to themselves 
to live of themselves. The angels plainly perceive that they do not live of themselves, but from the Lord, since they live in the very being of the Lord's life, because in His love. But yet to them 
above all others there is given the appearance as of living from themselves, together with ineffable happiness. This therefore is to live in the Lord, which is never possible unless we live in His 
love, that is, in charity toward the neighbor. </p>

That 'blessed be God Most High' means the Lord's Internal Man is clear from what has been stated just above concerning the Internal Man. Jehovah was called 'God Most High' in the Ancient Church for the 
reason that 'height' represented and therefore meant what is internal, so that 'Most High' meant that which is inmost. This is why the worship of the Ancient Church was celebrated on high places, mountains, 
and hills. Also, that which is inmost in relation to the exterior and outermost is exactly the same as that which is the most high in relation to lower and lowest. The Most High, or Inmost, 
is the Celestial element of Love, or Love itself. Jehovah, or the Lord's Internal, was the Celestial element itself of Love, that is, it was Love itself, to which no other attributes are appropriate than 
those of pure Love and so of pure Mercy towards the whole human race, that Mercy being such that it wills to save all men, to make them eternally happy, and to impart to them all that is its Own - 
thus out of pure Mercy and by the mighty power of love to draw towards heaven, that is, towards Itself, all who are willing to follow. That Love itself is Jehovah. To Love alone, and to nothing else, 
is [the substantive verb] Am or Is truly applicable. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From that Love the Being (Esse) of all life is derived, that is, Life itself is derived; for that Being is present within Love and is Love 
itself. And because Jehovah alone, since He alone is Love, is the Being (Esse) of life, or Life itself, every single thing has its being (esse) and its life from Him. Nor can anyone except Jehovah alone, 
that is, the Lord alone, be and live from himself. And because no one except the Lord alone can do so, men's seeming to themselves to live from themselves is an illusion of the senses. Angels perceive 
clearly that they do not live from themselves but from the Lord, since they live in the Being (Esse) of the Lord's life because they abide in His Love. Yet to them more than to all others there is 
granted, together with indescribable happiness, the appearance of living as if from themselves. This therefore is what is meant by living in the Lord, something that is not possible unless one lives 
in His Love, that is, in charity towards the neighbour. </p>

'Benedictus Deus Altissimus': quod significet Internum Hominem Domini, constat ex illis quae mox supra de Interno Homine dicta sunt. Deus Altissimus dictus est Jehovah in Antiqua Ecclesia, ex causa 
quia 'altitudo' repraesentabat et ideo significabat internum, ita 'altissimus' intimum; inde cultus Antiquae Ecclesiae super excelsis, montibus, collibus; intimum etiam ad exterius et extimum nec aliter 
se habet quam altissimum ad inferius et infimum; Altissimum seu Intimum est Caeleste Amoris seu ipse Amor; Jehovah seu Internum Domini erat ipsum Caeleste Amoris, hoc est, ipse Amor, cui nulla alia 
attributa competunt quam quae sunt puri Amoris, ita purae Misericordiae erga universum genus humanum, quae est ut omnes salvare et felices facere in aeternum et omnia Sui in illos transferre velit; ita 
ex pura Misericordia omnes qui sequi volunt, ad caelum, hoc est, ad Se, vi forti amoris, trahere. Ipse Amor Ille est Jehovah, de nulla alia re praedicari potest Sum aut Est quam de Amore;  [2] ex Amore 
illo, quia in Amore seu ipsius Amoris, est Esse omnis vitae, hoc est, ipsa Vita; et quia Jehovah solus est Esse vitae, seu ipsa Vita, quia solus Amor, omnia et singula inde suum esse et suam vitam habent, 
nec quisquam potest esse et vivere a se quam solus Jehovah, hoc est, solus Dominus; et quia non quisquam esse et vivere potest a se quam solus Dominus, fallacia sensus est quod videantur sibi 
homines vivere a se; angeli manifeste percipiunt quod non vivant a se sed a Domino, quia vivunt in Esse vitae Domini, quia in Amore Ipsius; sed usque illis datur apparentia sicut vivant ex se, prae 
omnibus aliis, cum felicitate ineffabili: hoc itaque est vivere in Domino, quod nusquam dabile est nisi vivatur in Amore Ipsius, hoc est, in charitate erga proximum. </p>
