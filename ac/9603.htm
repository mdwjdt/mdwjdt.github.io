<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9603节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9603.</strong>“所有幔子都要一样的尺寸”表事情的状态要彼此一样。这从“尺寸”的含义清楚可知，“尺寸”是指在真理上的事情的状态（参看<a href="3104.htm">3104</a>节），因此“所有幔子都要一样的尺寸”表示对一切真理来说，事情的状态都要一样。事情的同样状态当论及属灵国度中的信之真理时，是指它们都要仰望良善，并通过良善仰望主，就是它们的源头。不仰望良善，从而不仰望主的真理不是信之真理，因而也不是教会或天堂的真理。朝其它方向仰望的真理外表的确看似真理，但其实不是真理，因为它们没有生命。事实上，真理的生命就是良善，而良善来自主，唯独主是生命。朝其它方向仰望的真理就像没有一个灵魂的一个身体的各个部位，这些部位不是任何身体的部位，因为它们没有生命，因而毫无用处。<br />“尺寸”表示在真理上的事情的状态，以及在良善上的事情的状态，这一点从圣言中论述新耶路撒冷的尺寸，以及新殿尺寸的经文明显看出来。新耶路撒冷或圣耶路撒冷表示主的新教会，新殿也是；因此，它们的尺寸表示在真理上和在良善上的事情的状态；如启示录：<br />天使拿着金苇子，要量圣耶路撒冷，城门和城墙。天使用苇子量那城，共有一万二千斯他丢。又量了城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.15.htm">21:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">17</a>）<br />很明显，“尺寸”在此表示在良善和真理上的状态，因为“圣耶路撒冷”是指主的新教会；“城门和城墙”是指起保护作用的信之真理；“一万二千”表示整体上的一切真理和良善；“一百四十四”具有同样的含义（<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节），这个数字与数字“12”所表相同，因为它是12与12的乘积，而“12”表示整体上的一切真理和良善（参看<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>e，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>e，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>节）。“人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸”表示这就是教会和天堂在爱之良善和信之真理方面的状态，因为“人”是指教会，“天使”是指天堂。若不知道“圣耶路撒冷”、“城门”、“城墙”，“一万二千斯他丢”这个数字，“城墙的尺寸共有一百四十四肘”表示什么，以及“尺寸”、“人”、“天使”表示什么，谁会知道“城的尺寸共有一万二千斯他丢”、“城墙的尺寸，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘”究竟是什么意思呢？<br />撒迦利亚书中的“量”所表相同：<br />我又举目观看，见一人手拿量绳。我说，你往哪里去？他说，要去量耶路撒冷，看有多宽、多长。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.2.htm">2</a>）<br />以及在以西结书40-42章中，一个人手拿量竿量新城的屋子，以及殿，即：墙、门、墙脚或矮墙、门槛、窗户和台阶。若非这些尺寸表示在真理和良善方面的事情的状态，经上永远不会提及这些细节。“量”一般表示真理和良善的状态；如耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，若能量度上天，寻察下地的根基，看哪，我就因他们所做的一切弃绝以色列的种。看哪，日子将到，这城必为耶和华建造。量绳要往外量出，直到迦立山冈，又转到歌亚。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.37.htm">31:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.39.htm">39</a>）<br />以及以赛亚书：<br />谁曾用手心量诸水，用手虎口测诸天，用秤称大山，用天平平小山呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.12.htm">40:12</a>）</p>

One measure for all the curtains. That this signifies a like state of the matter, is evident from the signification of a "measure," as being the state of a thing as to truth (see n. 3104); consequently 
"one measure for all the curtains" denotes a like state of the matter for all the truths. By a like state of the matter, when said concerning the truths of faith in the spiritual kingdom, is meant 
that they all look to good, and that through good they look to the Lord from whom they are; for the truths which do not look to good, and thus to the Lord, are not truths of faith, consequently are not 
the truths of the church or of heaven. The truths which look in another direction may indeed in their external form appear like truths, but they are not truths, because they are devoid of life; for 
the life of truth is good, and good is from the Lord, who alone is life. Truths which look in another direction are like the members of a body without a soul, which are not members of any body, because 
they are lifeless, and therefore of no use. [2] That "measure" signifies the state of a thing as to truth, and also the state of a thing as to good, is evident from the passages in the Word that treat 
of the measurements of the New Jerusalem, and also of the new temple. By the "New" or "Holy Jerusalem" is signified the Lord's New Church, in like manner by the temple; and therefore by their "measurements" 
are signified states as to truth and as to good; as in John: </p>
<p>     The angel had a golden reed, to measure the holy Jerusalem, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof; and he measured the 
city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred forty and four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:15-17). That the "measurements" 
here signify states as to good and truth is very manifest, for the "holy Jerusalem" denotes the Lord's New Church; "the gates and the wall" denote the protecting truths of faith; "twelve thousand" 
denotes all truths and goods in the complex; likewise "a hundred forty and four" (n. 7973), for this number signifies the like as the number "twelve" because it arises from twelve multiplied by 
twelve (that "twelve" denotes all truths and goods in the complex, see n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913); "the measure of a man, that is, of an angel" signifies that such is the state of the 
church and of heaven in respect to the goods of love and the truths of faith, for "a man" denotes the church, and "an angel," heaven. Unless it were known what is signified by "the holy Jerusalem," 
by its "gate" and its "wall," by the number "twelve thousand furlongs," and by "the measure of the wall being a hundred forty and four," also what by "measure," what by "a man," and what by "an angel," 
who would ever know what is meant by "the measure of the city being twelve thousand furlongs," and "the measure of the wall a hundred forty and four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel"? [3] 
The like is signified by "measurement" in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I lifted up mine eyes again and saw a man in whose hand was a measuring line. I said, Whither goest thou? He said, To measure Jerusalem, 
to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof (Zech. 2:1-2). Also in Ezekiel, where a man who had a measuring reed measured the houses of the new city, and also the temple, 
as to the outer walls, the inner walls, the gates, the foundations, the thresholds, the windows, the steps (Ezek. 40-42). Unless these measurements signified the states of the matter in respect to truth 
and good, such things would never have been mentioned. By "measuring" in general is signified the state of truth and good; as in these passages: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah, If the heavens above shall 
be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, behold still will I disapprove the seed of Israel for all that they have done. Behold the days come in which the city shall be built 
to Jehovah. And the measuring line shall go out more fully over the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah (Jer. 31:37-39).      Who hath measured the waters in His fist, and meted out the heavens 
with the span, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? (Isa. 40:12). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9603</b></p><p><b>9603.</b>
'All the curtains shall have one measure' means that the state of affairs shall be the same [with each one]. This is clear from the meaning of 'measure' as the state of affairs as regards truth, dealt 
with in <a href="3104.htm">3104</a>, so that 'all the curtains shall have one measure' means that the state of affairs shall be the same with every truth. The expression 'the same state of affairs', when applied to the truths 
of faith in the spiritual kingdom, means that they all look towards good, and through good towards the Lord, the Source of it. Truths which do not look in this direction are not the truths of faith, 
nor consequently are they truths of the Church or of heaven. Truths which look in some other direction may indeed to outward appearance seem like truths, but they are not truths because they are devoid 
of life. For the life of truth is good, and good comes from the Lord, who Alone is life. Truths that look in any other direction are like members of a body without a soul, which are not the members 
of any body because they are devoid of life and so are useless.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'measure' means the state of affairs as regards truth, and also the state of affairs as regards good, is evident 
from the places in the Word where the measures of the new Jerusalem, and also those of the new temple, are the subject. The new or holy Jerusalem means the Lord's New Church, as does the new temple; 
therefore by their measures states of affairs as regards truth and as regards good are meant, as in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The angel had a gold reed to measure the holy Jerusalem, and its gates, and its wall. And 
he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man (homo), that is, of an angel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:15-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:15-17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The 
measures stated here, it is plainly evident, mean states as regards good and truth, for 'the holy Jerusalem' is the Lord's New Church, 'its gates and wall' being the protective truths of faith. 'Twelve 
thousand' means all the truths and forms of good in their entirety; and 'a hundred and forty-four' has a similar meaning, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, for this number is similar in meaning to the number twelve because it 
is the product of twelve multiplied by twelve, and 'twelve' means all truths and forms of good in their entirety, see <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>(end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>(end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>. 'The measure of a man, that is, 
of an angel' means that this is what the state of the Church and of heaven is like as regards forms of the good of love and truths of faith; for 'a man' is the Church and 'an angel' is heaven. Without 
knowledge of what is meant by 'the holy Jerusalem', by 'its gates and wall', by the number 'twelve thousand furlongs', and by the measure of the wall being 'a hundred and forty-four [cubits]', and 
also what is meant by 'the measure', 'a man', and 'an angel', would anyone ever know [the real meaning of the description] that the measure of the city was twelve thousand furlongs, or that the measure 
of a wall of <a href="144.htm">144</a> cubits was the measure of a man, that is, of an angel?  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Much the same is meant by the measuring in Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a man (vir) who had a 
measuring line in his hand. I said, Where are you going? And he said, To measure Jerusalem to see how broad it is and how long it is. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%202:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 2:1, 2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Chapters <a href="40.htm">40</a>-<a href="42.htm">42</a> of Ezekiel, which speak 
about the man with a measuring rod, who measured the houses of the new city, and also the temple - the walls, gates, footings, thresholds, windows, and steps. Unless the measurements in these places had 
meant the states of the thing as regards truth and good, such details would never have been mentioned. 'Measuring' generally means the state of the truth and good: In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, 
If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth beneath searched out, behold, I will nevertheless reject the seed of Israel on account of all that they have done. Behold, the 
days are coming in which the city for Jehovah will be built. And the measuring line will again go out over the hill of Gareb, and around towards Goah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:37-39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:37-39</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And also in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Who has 
measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, marked off<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the heavens with His span, and gathered the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in a balance, and the hills on the scales? 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:12</a>.

`Mensura una omnibus aulaeis': quod significet statum rei similem, constat ex significatione `mensurae' quod sit status rei quoad verum, de qua n. 3104; inde `mensura una omnibus aulaeis' est status 
rei similis omnibus veris. Per statum rei similem, cum dicitur de veris fidei in regno spirituali, intelligitur quod omnia spectent bonum, et per bonum spectent Dominum, a Quo; nam vera quae non ita 
spectant non sunt vera fidei, {1}proinde nec vera Ecclesiae aut caeli; vera quae alio spectant, quidem in externa forma possunt apparere sicut vera, sed non sunt vera, sunt enim absque vita, nam vita 
veri est bonum, et bonum est a Domino, Qui solus vita; vera alio spectantia sunt sicut membra corporis absque anima, quae non sunt membra alicujus corporis, quia sunt inanimata et sic nullius usus. 	Quod 
mensura significet statum rei quoad verum, et quoque 2 statum rei quoad bonum, patet a locis in Verbo ubi agitur de mensurationibus novae {2} Hierosolymae, et quoque novi templi; per novam seu sanctam 
Hierosolymam significatur Nova Domini Ecclesia, similiter per templum; quapropter per mensuras eorum significantur status quoad verum et quoad bonum, ut apud Johannem, 	Angelus calamum habebat 
aureum ut metiretur sanctam Hierosolymam, et portas ejus, et murum ejus; et mensus est urbem calamo in stadiis duodecies mille; mensus est murum ejus centum quadraginta quattuor cubitorum, quae est mensura 
hominis, hoc est, angeli, Apoc. xxi 15-17; </p>
<p>quod mensurae hic significent status quoad bonum et verum, manifeste patet, nam `sancta Hierosolyma' est Nova Domini Ecclesia, `portae et murus ejus sunt 
vera fidei tutantia, `duodecies mille' sunt omnia vera et bona in complexu, similiter centum quadraginta quattuor, n. 7973, hic enim numerus (t)simile significat cum numero duodecim, quia {3}exsurget 
a duodecim multiplicatis in duodecim; quod duodecim sint omnia vera et bona {4} in complexu, videatur n. 577, 2089, 2129 fin., 2130 fin., 3272, 3858, 3913; `mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli' significat 
talem (d)esse statum Ecclesiae et caeli quoad {5}bona amoris et vera fidei, `homo' enim est Ecclesia, et `angelus' est caelum; nisi sciretur quid sancta Hierosolyma, quid ejus {6}portae et murus, 
quid numerus duodecies mille {7}in stadiis, et mensura muri centum quadraginta quattuor, tum quid mensura, {8} quid homo, et quid angelus, quis usquam sciret {9}quod mensura urbis esset duodecies mille 
in stadiis, et mensura muri 144 cubitorum esset mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli? 	3 Simile per mensurationem significatur apud Sachariam, 	Sustuli oculos meos et vidi, cum ecce vir cujus in manu 
funiculus mensurae; dixi, Quo tu vadis? qui dixit, Ad metiendum Hierosolymam ut videam quanta latitudo ejus, et quanta longitudo ejus, ii 5, 6 [A.V. 1, 2]: </p>
<p>tum apud Ezechielem, 	Ubi vir cui calamus 
mensurae {10}, mensus est {11}domos novae urbis, ut et templum, quoad muros, parietes, portas, substructiones, limina, fenestras, gradus, de quibus ibi (x)xl-xlii; </p>
<p>nisi ibi mensurationes significarent 
status rei quoad verum et bonum, talia nequaquam {12}memorata fuissent.  Per `mensurare' in communi significatur status veri et boni: apud Jeremiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, Si mensurabuntur caeli sursum, 
et pervestigabuntur fundamenta terrae deorsum, ecce usque Ego reprobabo semen Israelis propter omne quod fecerunt; ecce dies venientes quibus aedificabitur urbs Jehovae, et exibit amplius linea mensurae 
super collem Gareb, et circuibit ad Goah, xxxi 37, 38, 39: </p>
<p>tum apud Esaiam, 	Quis mensus est pugillo aquas, et (x)caelos spithama expendit, et complexus est trientali pulverem terrae, et appendit
