<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2446节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2446.</strong>“硫磺”表我欲之恶的地狱，“火”表由此而来的虚假的地狱。这从圣言中“硫磺”和它所产生的“火”的含义清楚可知，“硫磺”和“火”是指自我之爱和它的恶欲，以及衍生的虚假，因而是指地狱，因为地狱就是由这类事物构成的。“硫磺”和“火”具有这样的含义，明显可见于诗篇：<br />耶和华要密布网罗，将烈火、硫磺如雨般落到恶人身上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.6.htm">11:6</a>）<br />此处并非指火与硫磺，“烈火、硫磺”表示别的东西。这一点从经上说耶和华“密布网罗”也能明显看出来。以西结书：<br />我必用瘟疫和流血的事刑罚他。我也必将暴雨、大雹与火并硫磺如雨般降与他和他的军队，并跟随他的众民。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.22.htm">38:22</a>）<br />这论及歌革，他将以色列的地，即教会荒废。至于何为歌革，可参看前文（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节）。“火”表虚假，“硫磺”表衍生的邪恶，同时表那些已荒废之人的地狱。启示录：<br />那拜兽之人被扔进烧着硫磺的火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.20.htm">19:20</a>）<br />此处它们表地狱。<br />那魔鬼被扔在硫磺的火湖里，就是兽和假先知所在的地方。他们必昼夜受痛苦，直到永永远远。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.10.htm">20:10</a>）<br />此处它们明显表地狱。<br />可憎的、杀人的、淫乱的、行邪术的、拜偶像的和一切说谎话的，他们的分就在烧着硫磺的火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.8.htm">21:8</a>）<br />此处“火与硫磺”也明显表地狱。<br />这二者表我欲的邪恶和由此而来的虚假，地狱就起源于它们。这一点可见于以赛亚书：<br />因耶和华有报仇之日，为锡安的争辩有报应之年。以东的河水要变为石油，尘埃要变为硫磺，地土成为烧着的石油。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.8.htm">34:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处提到了“烧着的石油”，没有提及“火”。“烧着的石油”表密集而可怕的虚假。“硫磺”表出于我欲的邪恶。<br />其中堆的是火与许多木柴。耶和华的气如一股燃烧的硫磺火，使它着起来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.33.htm">30:33</a>）<br />这论及陀斐特；“一股燃烧的硫磺火”表出于我欲之恶的虚假。路加福音：<br />到罗得出所多玛的那日，就有火与硫磺从天上如雨般降下来，把他们全都灭了。人子显现的日子也要这样。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.29.htm">17:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.30.htm">30</a>）<br />谁都能看出，这不是指那时火与硫磺如雨般降下；而是指自我之爱的的虚假和欲望那时会占主导地位，这虚假和欲望才是“火与硫磺”所表示的，它们构成地狱。<br />在圣言中，“火”表恶欲，同时表地狱，在这种情况下，火所冒出的“烟”表由此而来的虚假，它由这些地狱产生并存在于其中（参看<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>节）。启示录：<br />我在异象中看见那些马和骑马的，骑马的有火与硫磺的胸甲；马的头好像狮子头，有火、有烟、有硫磺，从马的口中出来。火与烟，并硫磺，这三样杀了人的三分之一。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.17.htm">9:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“火与烟，并硫磺”表各种邪恶和虚假，如前所述，地狱就起源于它们。</p>

That "brimstone" denotes the hell of the evils of the love of self, and "fire" the hell of the falsities thence derived, is evident from the signification in the Word of "brimstone" and the "fire" from 
it, as being the love of self with its cupidities and the derivative falsities, thus as being hell, for hell consists of such things. That "brimstone" and "fire" have this signification is evident 
in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall rain upon the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone (Ps. 11:6). That fire and brimstone are not here meant, but something else that is signified by "fire and brimstone," is 
evident also from its being said that Jehovah "rains snares." In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will contend against him with pestilence and with blood, and I will make it rain an overflowing rain, and hailstones, 
fire and brimstone, upon him, and upon his troops, and upon the many peoples that are with him (Ezek. 38:22); </p>
<p>where God is treated of, who lays waste the land of Israel, that is, the church. (The signification 
of "God" may be seen above, n. 1151.) "Fire" denotes falsities, "brimstone" the evils thence, and at the same time the hells of those who lay waste. In John: </p>
<p>     They who adored the beast 
were cast into a lake of fire burning with brimstone (Rev. 19:20); </p>
<p>meaning hell. Again: </p>
<p>     The devil was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are; and they 
shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever (Rev. 20:10); </p>
<p>manifestly meaning hell. Again: </p>
<p>     The abominable, and murderers, and adulterers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, 
shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone (Rev. 21:8); </p>
<p>where also "fire and brimstone" plainly denote hell. [2] That they denote the evils of the love of self and the falsities 
thence derived, from which come the hells-in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The day of the vengeance of Jehovah, and the year of retribution in the controversy of Zion; and the streams thereof shall be turned 
into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch (Isa. 34:8-9); </p>
<p>     where "burning pitch," here mentioned instead of "fire," denotes dense and direful 
falsities and " brimstone" the evils from the love of self. Again: </p>
<p>     The pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah is like a stream of brimstone kindling in it (Isa. 30:33); </p>
<p>speaking 
of Topheth; the "stream of kindling brimstone" denoting falsities from the evils of the love of self. In Luke: </p>
<p>     In the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven 
and destroyed them all; even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed (Luke 17:29-30). That it will not then rain fire and brimstone is obvious; but what is meant is that the falsities 
and cupidities of the love of self, which are signified by "fire and brimstone," and which make the hells, will then predominate. [3] That in the Word "fire" signifies cupidities, and at the same 
time the hells, and that in this case the "smoke" from the fire signifies the falsity thence derived, and which is in those hells, may be seen above (n. 1861); and in John: </p>
<p>     I saw the horses in 
the vision, and them that sat upon them, having breastplates of fire and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouth issued fire, smoke, and brimstone: 
by these three were the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone (Rev. 9:17-18); </p>
<p>"fire, smoke, and brimstone" denote evils and falsities of every kind, of which as 
before said the hells consist. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2446</b></p><p><b>2446.</b>
'Brimstone' means the hell of the evils of self-love, and 'fire' the hell of falsities deriving from these. This is clear from the meaning in the Word of 'brimstone' and of 'fire' produced by it as self-love 
together with its evil desires and derivative falsities, and so as hell, for hell consists of such. That 'brimstone' and 'fire' have these meanings is clear in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will rain on 
the wicked, snares, fire and brimstone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2011:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 11: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that it is not fire or brimstone but something else that is meant here by 'fire and brimstone' becomes clear also from its being said that 
'Jehovah will rain snares'. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will dispute with him with pestilence and blood; and deluging rain and hailstones, fire and brimstone will I rain on him and on his hordes, and on the many 
peoples that are with him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38: 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Gog who lays waste the land of Israel, that is, the Church. What Gog is, see <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>. 'Fire' stands for falsities, 'brimstone' for derivative 
evils, and at the same time for the hells of those who lay waste. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Those who worshipped the beast were thrown into the lake burning with brimstone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19: 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here they stand for hell. 
In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The devil was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2020:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 20: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
they plainly stand for hell. In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
As for abominable people, and murderers, and adulterers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their lot will be in the lake burning with 
fire and brimstone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'fire and brimstone' plainly stands for hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That these two stand for the evils of self-love and for falsities deriving from these, in which the hells 
have their origin, is seen in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah's vengeance - the year of retributions in the controversy of Zion - and her streams will be turned into pitch, and her dust into brimstone, 
and her land will become burning pitch. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2034:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 34: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'burning pitch', mentioned instead of fire, stands for dense and dreadful falsities, 'brimstone' for evils which are the product of self-love. 
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Its pyre is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah is like a stream of burning brimstone in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30: 33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In this reference to Tophet, 'a stream of burning brimstone' 
stands for falsities which are the product of the evils of self-love. In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
On the day Lot went out of Sodom fire and brimstone rained from heaven and destroyed them all - so will it be 
on the day when the Son of Man is revealed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:-29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:-29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Anyone may see that it is not fire and brimstone that will rain down at that time but that the falsities and desires of self-love, 
which are meant by 'fire and brimstone' and which make up hell, will be predominant. 'Fire' in the Word means evil desires and at the same time the hells, in which case the smoke from the fire means 
falsity which arises from and exists in those hells, see <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>. And in John, </p>
<p>I saw horses in the vision, and those seated on them had breastplates of fire and of brimstone. And the heads of the horses 
were like lions' heads, and out of their mouths there went forth fire, smoke, and brimstone. By these three a third part of mankind was killed - by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%209:%2017,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 9: 17, 18</a>. </p>
<p>'Fire, smoke, and brimstone' stands for evils and falsities of every kind, in which, as stated, the hells have their origin. </p>

Quod `sulphur' sit infernum malorum amoris sui, et `ignis' sit infernum falsorum inde, constat a significatione `singulis' et inde `ignis' in Verbo quod sit amor sui cum ejus cupiditatibus (c)et inde 
falsitatibus, ita quod sit internum, hoc enim a talibus constitit: quod `sulphur et ignis' illa significent, constat apud Davidem, 	Jehovah pluet super impios, laqueos, ignem et sulphur, Ps. xi 6; </p>
<p>quod 
hic non sit ignis et sulphur, sed quod aliud quid, quod per `ignem et sulphur' significatur, constare potest etiam ex eo quod dicatur quod `Jehovah pluet laqueos': apud Ezechielem, 	Disceptabo 
cum eo peste et sanguine, et pluviam inundantem, et lapides grandinis, ignem et sulphur pluere faciam super eum, et super alas ejus, et super populos multos, qui cum eo, xxxviii 22; </p>
<p>ubi de Gogo qui vastat 
terram Israelis, hoc est, Ecclesiam; quid Gogus, videatur n. 1151; `ignis' pro falsis, `sulphur' pro malis inde, et simul pro infernis eorum qui vastant: apud Johannem, 	Qui adorabant bestiam, 
conjecti sunt in stagnum ardens sulphure, [Apoc.] xix 20, pro inferno: apud eundem, 	Diabolus conjectus est in stagnum ignis et sulphuris, ubi bestia et pseudopropheta, et cruciabuntur dies et noctes 
	in saecula saeculorum, Apoc. xx 10; </p>

ardente igne et sulphure, Apoc. xxi 8; </p>

retributionum ad litem Zionis et convertentur flumina ejus in picem, et pulvis ejus in sulphur, et erit terra ejus in picem ardentem, xxxiv 8, 9; </p>
<p>ubi `pix ardens' pro densis et diris falsis, loco ignis, 
`sulphur' pro malis quae ex amore sui: apud eundem, 	Rogus ejus, ignis et ligna multa, flatus Jehovae sicut flumen sulphuris ardentis in ea, xxx 33; </p>
<p>ubi de Tophet, `flumen sulphuris ardentis' pro
