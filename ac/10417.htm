<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10417</strong>.出埃及记32:7-14.耶和华向摩西讲话，去！你下去吧；因为你的百姓，就是你从埃及地领上来的，已经败坏了自己。他们快快偏离了我所吩咐他们的道，为自己铸了一只牛犊，去敬拜它，向它献祭说，以色列啊，这些就是你们的神，是领你们从埃及地上来的。耶和华对摩西说，我看这百姓，看哪，这真是硬着颈项的百姓。你且由着我，让我的怒气向他们发热，将他们灭绝，我要使你成为一个大民族。摩西便恳求他的神耶和华的脸，说，耶和华啊，你的怒气为什么向你的百姓发热呢？他们是你用大能和大力的手从埃及地领出来的。为什么使埃及人讲说，祂领他们出去，是要降祸，把他们杀在山中，将他们从地面上除灭？求你转回，不发你的烈怒；后悔，不降祸与你的百姓。求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列，你曾指着自己起誓，向他们讲说，我必使你们的种像天上的星那样增多；并且我必将我所说到的这全地给你们的种，他们要承受为产业，直到一个时代。于是耶和华后悔，不把祂所说的祸降与祂的百姓。<br />“耶和华向摩西讲话”表对以色列民族在内在品质方面的察觉和指示。“去！你下去吧”表看看他们对外在之物的兴趣。“因为你的百姓已经败坏了自己”表他们使自己完全背离了神性。“就是你从埃及地领上来的”表你曾以为你已将他们引向神性。“他们快快偏离了我所吩咐他们的道”表他们已经将自己从神性真理那里移除。“为自己铸了一只牛犊”表照着这民族的爱之快乐敬拜。“去敬拜它，向它献祭”表他们将这快乐当作良善本身和真理本身来敬拜。“说，以色列啊，这些就是你们的神”表它要高于一切受到敬拜。“是领你们从埃及地上来的”表引领他们的。“耶和华对摩西说”表进一步的指示。“我看这百姓”表已经预见到的事。“看哪，这真是硬着颈项的百姓”表他们不接受来自主的流注。“你且由着我”表他们不可如此顽固坚持。“让我的怒气向他们发热，将他们灭绝”表他们如此远离内在事物，因而远离神性事物，以致他们必然灭亡。“我要使你成为一个大民族”表圣言在其它地方将是好的，完美的。“摩西便恳求他的神耶和华的脸”表主因怜悯而记念。“说，耶和华啊，你的怒气为什么发热呢”表这个民族的背离。“向你的百姓，他们是你从埃及地领出来的”表从那里一路被提升上来。“用大能和大力的手”表凭神性能力。“为什么使埃及人讲说”表那些只对外在事物感兴趣的人，他们论到那些被提升到内在事物之人的话。“祂领他们出去，是要降祸，把他们杀在山中”表那些处于良善的人将被毁灭。“将他们从地面上除灭”表那些属教会的人将被毁灭。“求你转回，不发你的烈怒”表如果祂这样做，这个民族的背离将不会造成伤害。“后悔，不降祸与你的百姓”表对他们的怜悯。“求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列”表为了天堂和教会的缘故。“你曾指着自己起誓”表来自神性的确认。“向他们讲说”表预见和天意。“我必使你们的种像天上的星那样增多”表良善和真理，以及关于它们的认知或知识。“并且我必将我所说到的这全地给你们的种”表天堂和教会由它们构成。“他们要承受为产业，直到一个时代”表永生。“于是耶和华后悔，不把祂所说的祸降与祂的百姓”表对他们的怜悯。</p>

Verses 7-14. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people have corrupted themselves which thou madest to come up out of the land of Egypt; they have gone back suddenly from the way 
which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf, and have adored it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which made thee to come up out of the land of Egypt. 
And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it is a stiff-necked people. And thou, suffer Me, that Mine anger may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make 
thyself into a great nation. And Moses besought the faces of Jehovah his God, and said, Wherefore, O Jehovah, shall Thine anger wax hot against Thy people, which Thou has brought forth out of the land 
of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, Into evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from upon the faces 
of the earth? Turn back from the wrath of Thine anger, and repent Thee of the evil to Thy people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel Thy servants, to whom thou swarest by Thyself and spoke unto 
them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have said will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for an age. And Jehovah repented of the evil which He 
said He would do to His people. "And Jehovah spoke unto Moses" signifies perception and instruction concerning the Israelitish nation as to its quality within; "Go, get thee down" signifies to look 
at their external; "for thy people have corrupted themselves" signifies that they have completely turned themselves away from the Divine; "which thou madest to come up out of the land of Egypt" signifies 
whom thou didst believe to be led to the Divine; "they have gone back suddenly from the way which I commanded them" signifies that they have removed themselves from Divine truth; "they have made them 
a molten calf" signifies worship according to the delight of the loves of that nation; "and have adored it, and have sacrificed to it" signifies that they worship this as good itself and as truth 
itself; "and said, These are thy gods, O Israel" signifies that this is to be worshiped above all things; "which made thee to come up out of the land of Egypt" signifies which have led them; "and Jehovah 
said unto Moses" signifies further instruction; "I have seen this people" signifies what is foreseen; "and behold it is a stiff-necked people" signifies that they do not receive influx from the Lord; 
"and thou, suffer Me" signifies that there should not be so stubborn an insistence; "that Mine anger may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them" signifies that thus they turn themselves 
away from internal things, thus from things Divine, so that they must needs perish; "and I will make thyself into a great nation" signifies that the Word elsewhere would be good and excellent; "and Moses 
besought the faces of Jehovah his God" signifies that the Lord in mercy remembered; "and said, Wherefore, O Jehovah, shall Thine anger wax hot" signifies the turning away of that nation; "against 
Thy people which Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt" signifies elevation even from this; "with great power and with a strong hand" signifies by virtue of Divine power; "wherefore should 
the Egyptians speak, saying" signifies those who are in mere external things concerning those who are being raised into internal things; "into evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains" 
signifies that those who are in good will perish; "and to consume them from upon the faces of the earth" signifies that those who are of the church will perish; "turn back from the wrath of Thine 
anger" signifies that thus the turning away of that nation will not be hurtful; "and repent Thee of the evil to Thy people" signifies mercy for them; "remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel Thy servants" 
signifies for the sake of heaven and of the church; "to whom Thou swarest by Thyself" signifies confirmation by the Divine; "and spoke unto them" signifies foresight and providence; "I will multiply 
your seed as the stars of the heavens" signifies goods and truths, and the knowledges of these; "and all this land that I have said will I give to your seed" signifies from which are heaven and the church; 
"and they shall inherit it for an age" signifies eternal life; "and Jehovah repented of the evil which He said he would do to His people" signifies mercy for them. </p>

Verses 7-14  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go! go down; for your people have corrupted themselves, whom you caused to come up out of the land of Egypt. They have suddenly departed from the way which I 
have commanded them; they have made for themselves a calf of molded [metal], and worshipped it, and sacrificed to it, and said, These are your gods, O Israel, who caused you to come up out of the land 
of Egypt. And Jehovah said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people. And you, let Me alone, and let My anger grow hot against them, and let Me consume them; and let 
Me make you into a great nation. And Moses entreated the face of<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Jehovah his God, and said, Why, O Jehovah, does Your anger grow hot against Your people, whom You have led out of the land of Egypt with 
great power and with a strong hand? Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil He led them out, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from upon the face of the earth? Turn back from 
the heat of Your anger, and repent<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the evil against Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself, and spoke to them, I will multiply your seed 
as the stars of the heavens; and all this land which I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they will inherit it into the age<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>. And Jehovah repented<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the evil which He said He would do 
to His people. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah spoke to Moses' means perception and instruction regarding the Israelite nation, what it was like inwardly. 'Go! go down' means looking at their interest in what is external. 
'For your people have corrupted themselves' means that they have turned themselves away altogether from the Divine. 'Whom you caused to come up out of the land of Egypt' means whom, you believed, 
you had led to the Divine. 'They have suddenly departed from the way which I have commanded them' means that they have removed themselves from Divine Truth. 'And they have made for themselves a calf 
of molded [metal]' means worship in keeping with the delight belonging to that nation's loves. 'And worshipped it, and sacrificed to it' means that they worship that delight as essential good and as 
essential truth. 'And said, These are your gods, O Israel' means that it is to be worshipped above all things. 'Who caused you to come up out of the land of Egypt' means which led them. 'And Jehovah 
said to Moses' means further instruction. 'I have seen the people' means what has been foreseen. 'And behold, it is a stiff-necked people' means that they do not receive the inflow from the Lord. 'And 
you, let Me alone' means that they should not be so stubbornly insistent. 'And let My anger grow hot against them, and let Me consume them' means that they turn themselves so far away from inward and 
thus Divine things that they are inevitably destroyed. 'And let Me make you into a great nation' means a Word somewhere else which would be good and perfect. 'And Moses entreated the face of Jehovah' 
means that the Lord in mercy remembered. 'And said, Why, O Jehovah, does Your anger grow hot?' means that nation's turning away. 'Against the people whom You have led out of the land of Egypt' means 
being raised all the way up from there. 'With great power and with a strong hand' means by Divine Power. 'Why should the Egyptians speak, saying' means those interested solely in outward things, [what 
they say about those raised to inward things.] 'For evil He led them out, to kill them in the mountains' means that those with whom good exists will be destroyed. 'To consume them from upon the face 
of the earth' means that those belonging to the Church will be destroyed. 'Turn back from the heat of Your anger' means that if He does so that nation's turning away will not be harmful. 'And repent [of 
the evil] against Your people' means having mercy on them. 'Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants' means for heaven and the Church's sake. 'To whom You swore by Yourself' means confirmation 
from the Divine. 'And spoke to them' means Foresight and Providence. 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens' means forms of good and truths, and cognitions of them. 'And all this 
land which I have spoken of I will give to your seed' means of which heaven and the Church consist. 'And they will inherit it into the age' means eternal life. 'And Jehovah repented of the evil which 
He said He would do to His people' means having mercy on them.

Vers. 7-14.  Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, Vade, descende, quis corrupit se populis tuus, quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti. Recesserunt subito a via quam praecepi illis, fecerunt sibi vitulum 
fusilis, et adoraverunt illum, et sacrificarunt illi, et dixerunt, Hi dii tui, Israel, qui ascendere fecerunt te e terra Aegypti. Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Vidi populum hunc, et ecce populus 
durus cervice ille: Et tu, sine Mihi, et exardescat ira Mea in illos, et consumam illos, et faciam temet in gentem magnum. Et deprecatus est Moscheh facies Jehovae Dei sui, et dixit, Quare, Jehovah, exardescat 
ira Tua in populum Tuum, quem eduxisti e terra Aegypti, virtute magna et manu forti? Quare dicent Aegypti, dicendo, In malum eduxit illos ad occidendum illos in montibus, et ad consumendum illos 
a super faciebus terrae? revertere ab (x)excandescentia irae Tuae, et paeniteat Te super malum populo Tuo. Recordare Abrahami, Jischaki, et Israelis, servorum Tuorum, quibus jurasti in Te, et locutus 
es ad illis, Multiplicabo semen vestrum sicut stellas caelorum; et omnem terram hanc, quam dixi, Dabo semini vestro, et hereditabunt in saeculum. Et paenitebat Jehovam super malo quod dixit facere 
populo Suo. `Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen' significat perceptionem et instructionem de gente Israelitica, qualis intus esset: `Vade, descende' significat intuitionem in externum eorum: `quia corrupit 
se populus tuus' significat quod prorsus se averterit a Divino: `quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti' significat quem credideras duxisse ad Divinum: `recesserunt subito a via quam praecepi illis' 
significat quod removerint se a Divino Vero: `et fecerunt sibi vitulum fusilis' significat cultum secundum jucundum amorum illius gentis: `et adoraverunt illum, et sacrificarunt illi' significat 
quod colant id ut ipsum bonum ac ut ipsum verum: `et dixerunt, Hi dii tui, Israel' significat quod colendum supra omnia: `qui ascendere fecerunt te e terra Aegypti' significat quae duxerunt: `et dixit 
Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem adhuc: `Vidi populum' significat praevisum: `et ecce populus durus cervice ille' significat quod non recipiat influxum ex Domino: `et tu, sine Mihi' significat 
quod non tam contumaciter insistendum sit: `et exardescat ira Mea in illos, et consumam illos' significat quod sic se avertant ab internis, ita a Divinis, ut non possint non perire: `et faciam 
te in gentem magnam' significat Verbum alibi quod bonum et praestans: `et deprecatus est Moscheh facies Jehovae' significat Dominum ex misericordia recordatum esse: `et dixit, Quare, Jehovah, exardescat 
ira Tua' significat aversionem illius gentis: `in populum, quem eduxisti e terra Aegypti' significat elevationem usque ab illa: `virtute magna et manu forti' significat ex Divina Potentia: `quare dicent 
Aegyptii, dicendo' significat illos qui in meris externis sunt [de illis qui elevantur in interna]: `In malum eduxit illos ad occidendum illos in montibus' significat quod perituri qui in bono: 
`ad consumendum illos a super faciebus terrae' significat quod perituri qui ab Ecclesia: `revertere ab excandescentia irae Tuae' significat sic aversionem ejus gentis non nocituram: `et paeniteat Te super 
populo Tuo' significat misericordiam pro illis: `recordare Abrahami, Jischaki, et Israelis, servorum Tuorum' significat propter caelum et Ecclesiam: `quibus jurasti in Te' significat confirmationem 
a Divino: `et locutus es ad illos' significat Praevidentiam ac Providentiam: `Multiplicabo semen vestrum sicut stellas caelorum' significat bona et vera, ac cognitiones eorum: `et omnem terram hanc, 
quam dixi, Dabo semini vestro' significat a quibus caelum et Ecclesia: `et hereditabunt in saeculum' significat vitam aeternam: `et paenitebat Jehovam super malo quod dixit facere populo Suo' significat 
misericordiam pro illis.' </p>
