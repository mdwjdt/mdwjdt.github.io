<p><strong>[NCE]974.</strong> Next, the condition of people living after the Flood who can accept charitable feelings is portrayed by the bow in the cloud, which those people resemble (verses 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). The bow refers to people in the church, or in other words, the regenerate individual (verses 12, 13).{*1} It refers to all people in general (verses 14, 15) and to one who can be reborn in particular (verse 16). So the bow has to do not only with people inside the church but also with people outside it (verse 17).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} By "regeneration" Swedenborg means in general the process of human spiritual rebirth, and in specific, the last stage of that process in which the individual gains a new heart or will and a new mind or intellect. The process mirrors gestation, birth, infancy, and childhood. Although Swedenborg has much to say about it in Secrets of Heaven, see the chapter on reformation and regeneration in True Christianity (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_974/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_571" target=_top>571-620</a>) for a succinct introduction to the process.

Afterwards the state of man subsequent to the flood, who is in the capacity to receive charity, is described by the "bow in the cloud" which he resembles (verses 12 to 17). This "bow" has regard to the 
man of the church, or the regenerate man (verses 12, 13); to every man in general (verses 14, 15); specifically, to the man who is in the capacity of being regenerated (verse 16); and consequently 
not only to man within but also to man without the church (verse 17). </p>

After that, man's state after the Flood - a man who is capable of receiving charity - is described by the bow in the cloud, which he resembles, verses 12-17. This bow has regard to the member of the 
Church, that is, to one who is regenerate, verses 12, 13. It has regard to every one in general, verses 14, 15, and to the person who is capable of being regenerated in particular, verse 16. So it has 
regard not only to the person inside the Church but also to him who is outside the Church, verse 17. </p>

</p><b>974.</b>
Postea status hominis post diluvium, qui recipere charitatem potest, describitur per 'arcum in nube,' cui similis est, vers. 12-17; qui arcus spectat hominem Ecclesiae seu regeneratum, vers. 12, 13: 
spectat omnem hominem in genere, vers. 14, 15; hominem qui regenerari potest in specie, vers. 16; ita non solum hominem intra Ecclesiam sed etiam hominem extra Ecclesiam, vers. 17.
