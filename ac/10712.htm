<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10712</strong>.当他们被允许通过我的眼睛看我们地球上的物体时，他们很少注意这些物体。这是因为他们习惯在远离他们旁边的物体的一个层面上进行思考，因而只习惯在阴影中看它们。事实上，一个人的思维如何，他的看见就如何；或说一个人的思维层面决定了他对事物的看见。正是存在于思维层面的这种内在视觉在外在之物里面并通过这外在之物观看。当时，这些灵人还告诉我，他们星球的表面主要由岩石构成，只有岩石当中的一些山谷是可以耕种的。但我发觉，这种环境只存在于这些人所住的地方，在其它地方不是这样。这些灵人几乎一整天都与我在一起。</p>

When they were allowed to see the objects of this earth through my eyes, they paid very little attention to them, because it is customary for them to think far away from the nearest objects; thus not 
to see them, except in shade; for such as is the thought of a man, such is his sight; because it is the interior sight which is of the thought that sees in the exterior, and through it. They then said 
that their earth is very rocky, and that there are only some valleys between the rocks which are cultivated. But it was perceived that it was so only where these people dwelt; and that in other places 
it is different. They were with me for almost an entire day. </p>

When they were allowed to see objects on our planet by means of my eyes they paid very little attention to them. This was because they are accustomed to think on a level somewhat removed from the objects 
right next to them, and so were accustomed to see them only in shade; for the level on which a person thinks determines his vision of things. This inward sight existing on the level of thought is 
what sees within and by means of that which is outward. Those spirits also told me at this time that the surface of their planet consisted mainly of rock, and that only some of its valleys among the 
rocks were cultivated. But I sensed that these conditions existed only where those people lived and that elsewhere they were different. Those spirits were with me for almost a whole day.  </p>

</p><b>10712.</b>
Cum dabatur illis per meos (x)oculos videre objecta hujus telluris, perparum attendebant ad illa, ex causa quia familiare illis cogitare remote a proximis objectis, ita nec videre illa nisi in umbra, 
nam qualis cogitatio hominis est talis est ejus visus, est enim interior visus qui est cogitationis, qui videt in exteriore, et per illum.  Dicebant tunc quod tellus illorum sit perquam petrosa, et 
modo aliquae valles inter petras quae excultae; sed perceptum quod solum, ubi illi habitabant, talis esset, et quod aliter alibi.  Erant apud me fere per integrum diem. </p>
