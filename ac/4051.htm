<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4051.</strong>有些社群与脑中叫做峡部的区域有关，那里也有些灵人与脑中腺体表面的小纤维结有关；从这些小纤维结所发出的纤维是为了各种不同的功能。也就是说，这些纤维在那些初始物或腺体中行如一体，但在其终端却行动各异。与这类事物相对应的灵人的一个社群被带到我面前，下面是对它的描述：这些灵人上前来对我说，他们是人。但我蒙允许回答他们说，他们不是具有肉身的人，而是灵，因而也是人；原因在于，灵的一切都在寻求获得属于人的东西，包括类似具有肉身之人的形态。因为灵就是内在人。我还蒙允许告诉他们，人之所以为人，凭的是聪明和智慧，而不是他们的形态，因此善灵，尤其天使要比那些在肉身中的人优秀、杰出的多，因为比处于起肉身的人，他们更居于智慧之光。<br />他们听到这个回答后，说，他们的社群人数众多，然而没有哪两个人是相似的。我觉得由不相似的人所组成的社群不可能存在于来世，便与他们谈到这一点，最后得知：尽管他们不相似，但在目的上是团结一致的，因为目的对他们所有人来说，都是同一个。他们进一步说，他们的性质是这样：在言行方面，没有哪两个人是相似的，然而在意愿和思维方面，却是相似的。他们还举例说明这一点：当论到天使时，社群中有人说，他是天上最小的；另一个人则说，他是天上最大的；第三个人又说，他既不是最小的，也不是最大的；说法各异，但他们的思维却行如一体，因为凡想到成为最小的人，都是最大的，因而相对其他人来说，是最大的；然而，既不是最小的，也不是最大的，因为他们从不思想比别人优秀杰出。其它一切事都一样。就其最初意图而言，他们团结一致，但就其终极行为而言，他们行动的方式却各不相同。他们对着我的耳朵说话，说，他们是善灵，这是他们正常的说话方式。关于他们，我被告知，他们从哪里来不得而知，他们属于四处游荡的社群。</p>

There are societies which relate to that region in the brain which is called the isthmus, and there are also spirits who relate to the little knots of fibers in the brain, of a glandular appearance, 
from which there flow forth fibers for various functions; which fibers act as a one in those beginnings or glandules, but diversely in their extremities. One society of spirits to whom such things correspond 
was brought before me, concerning which I may state that the spirits came in front, and addressed me, saying that they were men. But I was permitted to reply that they were not men endowed with 
bodies, but were spirits, and thus also men; because everything of the spirit conspires to that which is of man, even to a form like a man endowed with a body, for the spirit is the internal man; and 
also because men are men from intelligence and wisdom, and not from form; and therefore good spirits, and still more angels, are men more than those who are in the body, because they are more in the 
light of wisdom. After this reply they said that there were many in their society, and yet not one in it like another. But as it seemed to me impossible that in the other life there could be a society 
of those who were unlike, I conversed with them about it, and was at last instructed that, though they were unlike, they were nevertheless consociated in respect to their end, which to them was one. 
They said further that their nature was such that each one acted and spoke in a manner unlike that of any other, and yet they were alike in will and thought. This they also illustrated by an example: 
when anyone in the society says of an angel that he is the least in heaven, and another says that he is greatest, and a third that he is neither least nor greatest, and this with great variety, their 
thoughts nevertheless act as a one, because the one who desires to be least is the greatest, and is relatively the greatest for this reason; and yet there is neither least nor greatest, because they 
do not think of pre-eminence; and it is the same with everything else. Thus are they consociated in first principles, but act diversely in the extreme or outermost things. They applied themselves to my 
ear and said that they were good spirits, and that such was their manner of speaking. It was said of them that it is not known whence they come, and that they are of the wandering societies. </p>

There are communities correlative with that region in the brain called the isthmus and also spirits correlative with the little knots of fibres in the brain which have a glandular appearance, from which 
fibres flow forth for different functionings. That is to say, these fibres behave in one and the same way in the glands where they originate but in differing ways at the points where they terminate. 
One community of spirits to whom such things correspond was brought before me, of which the following is a description: The spirits came in front and addressed me, saying that they were men. But I 
was allowed to reply to them that they were not men provided with bodies, but were spirits and so also men, the reason being that everything in a spirit seeks to attain that which is of man, including 
a form akin to that of a man provided with a body. For the spirit is the internal man. I was also allowed to tell them that men were men by virtue of intelligence and wisdom, not of their form, and consequently 
that good spirits, and more so angels, are more pre-eminently men than those who are in the body, because they dwell in the light of wisdom more than those in the body. </p>

 After I had 
made this reply they said that their community consisted of a large number, yet not one of them was like another. But because it did not seem possible to me that a community consisting of those who were 
not alike could exist in the next life I talked to them about it and at length I learned that although they were not alike they were nevertheless united as regards their end in view, which was the 
same for them all. They went on to say that they were such that each individual acted in a different way from the next and also spoke in a different way, and yet they were similar in what they willed 
and thought. They also illustrated this with an example. When someone in their community speaks of an angel being least in heaven, a second of his being greatest, and a third of his being neither least 
nor greatest, and so on with many varying ideas, they are still in their thoughts acting as one, for he who wishes to be least is the greatest, and in comparison with others is the greatest because 
of that wish; and yet neither least nor greatest enters into it because they are not thinking of pre-eminence over others. So it is with everything else. They are united so far as their first intentions 
are concerned, but in their ultimate deeds they act in differing ways. They spoke into my ear and said that they were good spirits and that this was their normal manner of speaking. Concerning them 
I was told that it was not known where they came from and that they belonged among communities that wander from place to place. </p>

Sunt societates quae referunt regionem illam quae in cerebro vocatur isthmus, {1}et quoque qui referunt nodulos fibrarum in cerebro, qui apparent sicut glandulares, e quibus fibrae effluunt ad varias 
functiones, quae nempe fibrae unum agunt in principiis illis seu glandulis, sed diversimode in extremis; una societas spirituum quibus talia correspondent, mihi oblata est, de qua haec; venerunt 
spiritus antrorsum; alloquebantur me, dicentes quod homines sint, sed {2}his respondere datum quod non homines sint corpore praediti sed spiritus, et sic quoque homines, quia omne spiritus conspirat 
ad id quod hominis est, etiam ad formam homini corpore praedito similem, spiritus enim est internus homo, tum quia homines sunt ex intelligentia et sapientia, et non ex forma, inde quod spiritus 
boni, et magis angeli sint homines prae illis qui in corpore, quia magis in luce sapientiae; [2] post hoc responsum dicebant quod plures sint in societate, in qua unus alteri non similis, sed quia 
mihi impossibile visum quod societas dissimilium in altera vita dari queat, locutus sum de illa re eum illis, et tandem instructus quod tametsi dissimiles, usque consocientur quoad finem, qui illis 
unus; dixerunt porro quod tales sint ut quisque dissimiliter agat et quoque dissimiliter loquatur quam alter, et tamen simile volunt et cogitant; hoc quoque illustrabant exemplo: eum unus in societate 
dicit de angelo quod minimus sit in caelo, alter dicit quod maximus, et tertius quod nec minimus nec maximus, et sic eum pluri varietate, {3}quoad cogitationes usque unum agunt, quod nempe 
qui minimus vult esse, sit maximus, et quod maximus sit inde respective, et quod nec minimus nec maximus, quia non cogitant de supereminentia;  similiter in reliquis; ita consociantur in principiis, 
sed diversimode agunt in extremis: applicabant se auri meae, et dicebant quod boni spiritus sint, et quod mos eorum loquendi sit talis; dicebatur de illis quod non sciatur unde veniunt, et quod inter 
societates vagabundas sint. @1 i estque parva regio quasi interstitialis inter cerebrum et cerebellum$ @2 illis$ @3 quod I$ </p>
