<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1477节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1477.</strong>“我的灵魂也因你存活”表属天之物以这种方式得救。这从“灵魂”表属天之物的含义清楚可知，因为属天之物是生命本身，故也是灵魂本身。由此清楚可知“我的灵魂也因你存活”表示什么。由下文明显可知，在主经受试探，并因此逐出来自母亲的遗传之恶前，属天或神性之物不会与主结合到他们构成一个本质的程度。本节以及下文描述了与此同时，属天之物本身如何没有遭受暴行，而是得救。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1477.</strong> That my soul may live because of you means that what was heavenly could be preserved in that case, as indicated by the symbolism of a soul as something heavenly. The heavenly element is the soul itself, since it is life itself. This shows what "that my soul may live because of you" symbolizes.<br />What follows{*1} will demonstrate that heavenly qualities, or divine ones, were not attached to the Lord so as to unite into a single essence [with his human qualities] until after he had suffered spiritual trials and by that means rid himself of the evil he had inherited from his mother. How his heavenly core remained unharmed and how it was instead preserved is portrayed in the current and following verses.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages in the remainder of this volume that relate to the exegesis mentioned here, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1573" target=_top>1573</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1607:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1661:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1707:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1708" target=_top>1708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1737" target=_top>1737</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793" target=_top>1793</a>.

That my soul may live because of thee. That this signifies that thus the celestial could be saved, is evident from the signification of the "soul," as being the celestial; for this is the soul itself, 
because the very life itself. Hence it is evident what is signified by the words "that my soul may live because of thee." It will be evident from what follows, that celestial or Divine things were not 
so adjoined to the Lord that they made one essence, until He endured temptations, and thus expelled the evil heredity from the mother. Here and in the following verses it is described how meanwhile 
the celestial itself suffered no violence, but was saved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1477</b></p><p><b>1477.</b>
'My soul may live because of you' means that in this way the celestial could be saved. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'soul' as the celestial, for being the essential life itself the celestial 
is the soul itself From this it is clear what 'so that my soul may live because of you' means From what follows it will be clear that celestial or Divine things were not so joined to the Lord that they 
constituted one Essence until He had undergone temptations and so had cast out hereditary evil from the mother. This verse and those that follow describe how in the meantime the celestial itself had 
no violence done to it but was saved. </p>

</p><b>1477.</b>
Quod 'vivat anima mea tui causa' significet quod sic caeleste posset salvari, constare potest a significatione 'animae' quod sit caeleste, hoc enim est ipsa anima quia ipsamet vita, inde constat quid 
significat 'ut vivat anima mea tui causa.' Ex sequentibus constabit quod caelestia seu Divina non adjuncta fuerint Domino ita ut unam Essentiam egerint, priusquam sustinuerit tentationes et sic expulerit 
malum hereditarium a matre: describitur hic et in versibus sequentibus quomodo interea ipsum caeleste non violatum sed salvatum. </p>
