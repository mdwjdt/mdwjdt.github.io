<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1377节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1377.</strong>在灵人界，地方、地方的变化、距离都是表象，这从以下事实明显可知：自创世之初就存在的所有灵魂和灵人总是出现在自己的地方。他们的地方从不改变，除非他们的状态改变。对他们而言，地方和距离随状态的变化而变化。不过，由于每个人都有一个总体的主导状态，状态的具体和个别变化都与总体状态相关，所以经历这些变化后，灵人们会回到自己的位置。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1377.</strong> The fact that location, change of location, and distance in the world of spirits are appearances was clarified for me in the following way: All souls and spirits whatsoever, from the beginning of creation, appear in their own position at all times and never change place except when conditions inside them change. As conditions inside them change, their relative location and distance alter too. Each spirit has a general, governing state, though, and the particular and the highly specific states still relate to the general one. For this reason, all spirits return to their position after such changes. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1377</b></p><p><b>1377.</b>
That in the world of spirits place, change of place, and distance, are an appearance, has been evidenced from the fact that all souls and spirits whatever who have existed from the first creation, appear 
constantly in their own places, and never change their places except when their state is changed; and that as their state is changed, so are the places and distances with them varied. But as everyone 
has a general state which is regnant, and as the particular and individual changes of state have regard to the general state, therefore after these changes all return to their own situation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1377</b></p><p><b>1377.</b>
The fact that place, change of place, or distance in the world of spirits is an appearance has been made clear from the consideration that all the souls and spirits that there have been since the beginning 
of creation appear to remain all the time in their own place. Nor does their place alter unless their state does. And as their state alters so are places and distances with them changed. But since 
everyone has a general governing state, and particular and individual changes of state nevertheless have regard to the general, spirits consequently go back after such changes to their own position. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1377</b>
</p><b>1377.</b>
Quod locus, mutatio loci, et distantia sit apparentia in mundo spirituum, inde constare potuit quod omnes quotcumque animae et spiritus fuerunt a prima creatione, appareant constanter in suis locis, 
nec usquam mutent loca nisi cum mutatur eorum status, et sicut mutatur status, etiam iis variantur loca et distantiae; sed quia unusquisque habet statum communem qui regnat, et mutationes status particulares 
et singulares usque spectant communem, inde est quod post mutationes istas redeant ad suum situm. </p>
