<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6923节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6923.</strong>还有一次，我看见一大群这类灵人，离我有一定距离，在前面向右一点。他们从那里与我交谈，不过要通过中间灵人；因为他们的言语流动得和思维一样迅速，若无中间灵人的帮助，就无法转化为人类语言。令我惊讶的是，他们的话语丰满而圆润；他们虽然一起说话，但快捷迅速丝毫没有减损。他们的言语在我听来，就像一种波浪，因为他们许多人同时说话；值得注意的是，它却滑向我的左眼，尽管他们是在右边。原因在于，左眼对应于从物质事物抽象出来的事物的知识，因而对应于属聪明的事物；而右眼对应于属智慧的事物。他们领悟并判断他们所听到的，和他们说话一样迅速；他们会说，是这样，不是这样。他们的判断可以说是瞬间形成的。</p>

At another time I saw a multitude of such spirits, but at some distance from me, in front, a little to the right, and they talked with me from there, but through intermediate spirits; for their speech 
is as quick as thought, which can fall into human speech only through intermediate spirits. And what surprised me, they spoke all together, and yet just as promptly and quickly. Their speech was perceived 
as an undulation, because it was of many together; and what is remarkable, it fell toward my left eye, though they were to the right. The reason was that the left eye corresponds to knowledges 
of things abstracted from things material, thus to such as are of intelligence; but the right eye corresponds to those which are of wisdom. They likewise perceived and judged what was heard with the same 
promptness as that with which they spoke, saying that this was so, and this not so. Their judgment was as it were instantaneous. </p>

On another occasion I saw a great number of that kind of spirits, but these were some distance away out in front, slightly to the right. They talked to me from there, but they did so with the help of 
intermediary spirits; for their speech, flowing as fast as thought, cannot be converted into human language without the help of intermediary spirits. And what surprised me, their words were full and 
rounded even though they spoke all together and yet with no less promptness and speed. Their speech sounded to me like a wave because there was a large number of them speaking simultaneously; and what 
was remarkable, it made its way towards my left eye even though those spirits were on the right. The reason for this was that the left eye corresponds to knowledge of things separated from their material 
associations, thus things that belong to intelligence, whereas the right eye corresponds to things that belong to wisdom. Displaying the same promptness as they did when speaking those spirits also 
perceived and formed judgements of the things they heard, saying, This is so, that is not so. Those judgements were formed by them almost instantaneously. </p>

</p><b>6923.</b>
Alio tempore vidi multitudinem talium spirituum sed ad aliqualem distantiam a me, antrorsum paulo ad dextrum, et inde loquebantur mecum sed per spiritus intermedios, nam loquela illorum tam cita est 
sicut cogitatio, quae in loquelam humanam non cadit nisi per spiritus intermedios; et quod miratus sum, loquebantur volumatim et tamen usque tam prompte et cito; appercipiebatur loquela eorum, quia plurium 
simul, sicut undulatio; et quod memorabile, labebatur illa versus sinistrum meum oculum tametsi illi erant ad dextrum; {1}causa erat quia sinister oculus correspondet cognitionibus rerum a materialibus 
abstractarum, ita illis quae sunt intelligentiae, dexter autem oculus illis quae sunt sapientiae.  Simili promptitudine qua loquebantur, etiam res auditas percipiebant, et de illis judicabant, 
dicendo hoc ita esse, hoc non ita; judicium eorum quasi instantaneum erat. 	@1 sinister enim$ </p>
