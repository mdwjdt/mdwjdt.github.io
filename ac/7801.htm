<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7801节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7801.</strong>来自木星的灵人有很多种，但与我同在并经常和我交谈的有三种。第一种，就是最低级的那种，外表发暗，几乎是黑色。他们受到其他人的蔑视，被称为“惩罚者”，因为他们惩罚其星球上生活邪恶的居民。他们一直渴望上天堂。第二种有发光的脸，如同从烛光反射而来。这些灵人看上去像偶像那样坐着，因为他们允许自己被其他人崇拜，尤其被他们在世上的仆人崇拜。事实上，他们说服这些仆人相信他们是主的中保。这些仆人称他们为“圣徒”，还称为“主”。第三种，就是最好的那种，在聪明和智慧上胜过其他人。他们身穿蓝衣，或天蓝色的衣服，衣服上织有小金粒。但来自木星的天使本身与其他所有星球的天使生活在一起；因为所有真正的天使构成一个包罗万象的天堂。</p>

There are many kinds of spirits from the planet Jupiter, but there are three with which I have been in company, and with which I have often spoken. One kind, which is also the lowest, appear dark, almost 
black. They are contemned by others, and are called "chastisers," because they chastise the inhabitants of their earth who live evilly; they are continually desirous to come to heaven. Another kind 
have shining faces, as from the reflected light of a candle. These appear to sit like idols, for they suffer themselves to be adored by others, especially by the servants whom they had in the world; 
for there they persuaded them that they were mediators with the Lord; they are called by them "saints," and also "lords." The third kind, which is the best, excel the rest in intelligence and wisdom. 
They appear in blue clothing, or clothing of the color of the sky, with interwoven little grains of gold. But the angels themselves who are from that earth, are together with the angels of the rest 
of the earths; for all who are truly angels constitute one general heaven. </p>

There are many kinds of spirits from the planet Jupiter, but there are three kinds whom I have moved among and often talked to. One kind, which is also the lowest, have a dark, almost black appearance. 
These are held in contempt by the others and are called chastisers, because they chastise the inhabitants of their planet who lead evil lives. They have a constant desire to get to heaven. The second 
kind have faces from which the reflected light of a candle seems to shine. They are seen sitting like idols, for they allow themselves to be worshipped by others, especially by the servants they had 
in the world. For there they convinced those servants that they were people who mediated with the Lord. They are called holy ones by them, and also lords. The third kind, which is the best, excel all 
the others in intelligence and wisdom. They appear dressed in clothing that is blue - sky-blue - together with sparks of gold woven into it. But actual angels from that planet live together with the 
angels belonging to all other planets; for all who are truly angels constitute one all-inclusive heaven. </p>

Sunt plura genera spirituum e planeta Jovis, sed sunt tria cum quibus conversatus sum et saepe locutus.  Unum genus, quod etiam est infimum, apparet obscurum, paene nigrum; spernuntur ab aliis, {1}et 
vocantur castigatores, quia castigant suae telluris incolas qui male vivunt; {2}continue cupiunt ad caelum venire.  Alterum genus lucet facie sicut ex lumine reflexo candelae; apparent sedere sicut 
idola, nam patiuntur se adorari ab aliis, imprimis a servis quos habuerunt {3} in mundo; ibi enim persuaserunt illis quod {4}essent mediatores ad Dominum; {5} dicuntur ab illis sancti et quoque domini. 
 Tertium genus, quod optimum, praevalet reliquis intelligentia et sapientia; {6} apparent in amictu caeruleo seu coloris caelestis cum intertextis miculis auri.  Ipsi autem angeli qui ex tellure illa 
sunt simul cum angelis reliquarum tellurum sunt; nam omnes {7}vere angeli unum commune caelum constituunt. 	@1 vocantur etiam$ 	@2 Before vocantur$ 	@3 i cum fuerunt$ 	@4 sint$ 	@5 i illi spiritus$ 	@6 
i et vocantur angeli, et ubi simul sunt, vocatur coelum, quod superius est ad dextrum;$ 	@7 qui vere angeli sunt$ </p>
