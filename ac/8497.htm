<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8497节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8497.</strong>“所剩下的要给自己留着，存放到早晨”表那时仿佛来自他们自己之物的一切良善和真理的享受。这从“所剩下的要存放到早晨”和“给自己留着”的含义清楚可知。“所剩下的要存放到早晨”是指作为安息日的享受；它之所以表示良善和真理的享受，是因为他们要把剩下的所烤所煮之物存放起来，到安息日吃；因为“烤”表示良善的准备，“煮”表示真理的准备，如刚才所示（<a href="8496.htm">8496</a>节）；“吃”表示享受并变成人自己的（<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>，<a href="7849.htm">7849</a>节）。“给自己留着”是指它（即享受）仿佛来自他们自己的东西。这些话之所以表示这些事，是因为从主流入的良善和真理被结合在一起，可以说变成此人自己的。天堂，也就是天堂里的人与主的结合就是这样。之所以说“仿佛来自他们自己的东西”，是因为信与仁之良善不可能被赋予世人或天使，以至于成为他们自己的，因为世人和天使只是接受者，或适合从主接受生命，因而接受来自祂的良善和真理的形式。生命本身并非来自其它源头；生命因来自主，故无法被归给到似乎是人自己的地步。然而，那些住在主里面的人明显发觉生命是流入的，因此发觉良善和真理也是流入的，因为这些包含在这生命中。生命之所以似乎是人自己的，是因为主出于神性之爱愿意将祂自己的一切都赐予并联结于人，只要这一切能实现，祂就把它进行联结。被主所赐予的这人自己的东西就被称为天堂的自我（参看<a href="731.htm">731</a>，<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2882.htm">2882</a>，<a href="2883.htm">2883</a>，<a href="2891.htm">2891</a>，<a href="3812.htm">3812</a>e，<a href="5660.htm">5660</a>节）。</p>

And all that is left over, this lay ye by for you to keep until the morning. That this signifies the enjoyment of all good and truth then as it were from their own, is evident from the signification 
of "laying by what is over until the morning," as being enjoyment on the Sabbath day; that it denotes the enjoyment of good and of truth, is because that which remained over of what was baked and boiled 
was to be laid by, and then was to be eaten; for by "baking" is signified the preparation of good, and by "boiling" the preparation of truth (as was shown just above, n. 8496); and by "eating" is signified 
enjoyment and appropriation (n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832, 4745, 7849); and from the signification of "for you to keep," as being as it were from their own. That these things are signified by these 
words is because the good and truth which flow in from the Lord are conjoined, and as it were appropriated. Such is the conjunction of heaven (that is, of those who are in heaven) with the Lord. It 
is said "as it were from their own," because the goods which are of faith and of charity cannot be given to man nor to angel so as to be their own, for men and angels are only recipients, or forms accommodated 
to receive life, thus good and truth, from the Lord. Life itself is from no other source, and as life is from the Lord, it cannot be appropriated otherwise than as appearing to be man's own; 
but they who are in the Lord plainly perceive that life flows in, consequently good and truth, for these belong to life. The reason why life appears as man's own is that the Lord from Divine love wills 
to give and to conjoin all His own to man, and as far as it can be effected, does conjoin it. This "own" which is given by the Lord, is called the heavenly own (see n. 731, 1937, 1947, 2882, 2883, 
2891, 3812, 5660). </p>

'And all that is left over put aside for yourselves to keep until the morning' means the enjoyment of all goodness and truth then as if from what was their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'putting 
aside what is left over till the morning' as enjoyment on the sabbath day, the reason why the enjoyment of goodness and truth is meant being that they were to put aside what was left over from the 
things they baked and boiled and to eat it on that day ('baking' means the preparation of good, and 'boiling' the preparation of truth, as has been shown immediately above in <a href="8496.htm">8496</a>, and 'eating' means 
enjoying and making one's own, <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>, <a href="7849.htm">7849</a>); and from the meaning of 'for yourselves to keep' as, as if it - the enjoyment - was from what was their own. The reason why 
these things are meant by those words is that goodness and truth which flow in from the Lord are joined together and so to speak made the person's own. This is what the joining of heaven, that is, of 
those in heaven, to the Lord is like. The words 'as if from what was their own' are used because the good of faith and charity can never be imparted to man or angel to be actually his own, for men and 
angels are merely recipients, or forms properly adjusted to receive life from the Lord, and so goodness and truth from Him. True life comes from no other source; and since life comes from the Lord it 
cannot be more than what seems to be a person's own. Those who abide in the Lord however clearly perceive that life flows in, consequently that goodness and truth do so since these are contained in that 
life. The reason why life seems to be a person's own is that in His Divine Love the Lord wishes to impart and join to a person all that is His, and so far as it can be done He does join it. What is 
then the person's own, yet is imparted to him by the Lord, is called a heavenly self or proprium, see <a href="731.htm">731</a>, <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2882.htm">2882</a>, <a href="2883.htm">2883</a>, <a href="2891.htm">2891</a>, <a href="3812.htm">3812</a> (end), <a href="5660.htm">5660</a>. </p>

`Et omne superfluum reponite hoc vobis ad custodiam usque ad mane': quod significet fruitionem omnis boni et veri tunc sicut ex proprio, constat ex significatione `superfluum reponere ad mane' quod 
sit fruitio die sabbati {1}; quod {2}sit fruitio boni et veri, est quia reponeretur superfluum ex illis quae coquebantur et {3} elixabantur, et quia tunc ederetur, per `coquere' enim significatur praeparatio 
boni, et per `elixare' praeparatio veri, ut mox supra n. 8496 ostensum est, ac per `edere' significatur fruitio et appropriatio, n. 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 3832, 4745, 7849; et ex significatione 
`vobis ad custodiam' quod sit sicut ex proprio, nempe fruitio; quod {4}haec significentur per (c)illa verba, est quia bonum et verum quae a Domino influunt {5}conjunguntur et quasi {6}appropriantur; 
talis est conjunctio caeli, hoc est, illorum qui in caelo sunt, cum Domino.  Sicut ex proprio dicitur, quia {7}bona quae fidei et charitatis non dari queunt homini nec angelo ut sint propria, homines 
enim et angeli sunt modo recipientes, seu formae accommodatae ad recipiendum vitam, ita bonum et verum a Domino {8}; ipsa vita non aliunde est; et quia vita est a Domino, {9} non potest illa aliter appropriari 
quam ut appareat sicut propria; sed qui in Domino sunt percipiunt manifeste quod vita influat, consequenter bonum et verum, nam haec sunt vitae.  Causa quod vita sicut propria appareat, est 
quia Dominus ex Divino Amore omnia Sua dare et conjungere vult homini, et quantum fieri potest, conjungit; {10}hoc proprium quod datur a Domino vocatur proprium caeleste, de quo videatur n. 731, 1937, 
1947, 2882, 2883, 2891, 3812 fin., 5660. 	@1 i, nam ad illum reponebatur$ 	@2 After veri$ 	@3 i ex illis$ 	@4 hoc significetur$ 	@5 conjungantur$ 	@6 approprientur$ 	@7 non dari queunt ut sint

proprium quod a Domino accipiunt$ </p>
