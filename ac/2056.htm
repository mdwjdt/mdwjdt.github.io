<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2056节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2056.</strong>“不受割礼的男子”表不具有信之真理者。这从“男子”的含义清楚可知，“男子”是指信之真理（参看<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>节）；因此，“不受割礼的男子”表不具有信之真理，并由此受制于虚假者。“不受割礼”论及阻碍和玷污之物，如前所述。当加上“男子”一词时，“不受割礼”是指阻碍和玷污真理之物；当加上其它东西时，它表示真理的堕落和毁坏。如耶利米书提到“未受割礼的耳朵”：<br />我可以向谁说话作见证，使他们听呢？看哪，他们的耳朵未受割礼，不能听见。看哪！耶和华的话，他们以为羞辱，不以为喜悦。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.10.htm">6:10</a>）<br />“耳朵未受割礼”表他们根本不听的事实，对他们来说，圣言是一种羞辱。<br />而且，本节论述了教会中那些不仅受制于虚假，还受制于对自我和这个世界之爱的淫秽之人，因为本节是前文的延续。故经上说“不受割礼的男子，就是没有割去肉体包皮的”，因此意思是与生活的淫秽相联结的虚假。至于这些人会招致何等大的永恒诅咒的危险，这从前面所述可以看出来（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>节）。这些话尤表教会中那些亵渎信之良善与真理的人，关于他们，经上说“灵魂必从他的民中被剪除”。因为这些人能犯亵渎罪，而教会外的人则不能，如第一卷所示（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>节）。</p>

And the uncircumcised male. That this signifies one who is not in the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of a "male," as being the truth of faith (see above, n. 2046); the "uncircumcised 
male" therefore here signifies one who is not in the truth of faith, and who is thereby in what is false. That is said to be "uncircumcised" which obstructs and defiles, as before said. When said of 
the "male," it is that which obstructs and defiles truth; and in like manner when it is said of any other subject, it signifies the darkening and contamination of that subject. Thus an "uncircumcised 
ear" is mentioned in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Upon whom shall I speak and testify, and they will hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken; behold the Word of Jehovah is become unto them 
a reproach; they do not desire it (Jer. 6:10); </p>
<p>their "ear being uncircumcised" means that there was no hearkening, and that the Word was a reproach unto them.  [2] Moreover the verse before us treats 
of those who are within the church, and who are not only in falsity, but also in the impurity of the loves of self and of the world; for these things are said in continuation of what was said before. 
It is therefore said "the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin," and thus the meaning is falsity conjoined with impurity of life. How great a danger of eternal 
damnation these are incurring may be seen from what was said above (n. 2051). These words especially signify those within the church who profane the goods and truths of faith, of whom it is said, "that 
soul shall be cut off from his people;" for these can commit profanation, but not those who are outside the church (as has been shown in Part First, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059). </p>

That 'the uncircumcised male' means one who does not possess the truth of faith is clear from the meaning of 'a male' as the truth of faith, dealt with above in <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>. 'The uncircumcised mare' here therefore 
means one who does not possess the truth of faith and so is subject to falsity. 'Uncircumcised' has reference to what stands in the way and defiles, as stated already. When added to the word 'male' 
it refers to that which stands in the way of and defiles truth. And when added in a similar way to anything else it means the degradation and corruption of that same thing, as with 'an uncircumcised 
ear' in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On whom shall I speak and testify and they will hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen. Behold, the Word of Jehovah has become a reproach; they have 
no wish for it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Uncircumcised ear' stands for the fact that they did not listen at all and that to them the Word was a reproach. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The present verse also deals with those inside the 
Church who are subject not only to falsity but also to the impurity of self-love and love of the world, for this verse continues what has gone before. Hence the statement 'the uncircumcised male who 
is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin' - thus having the meaning of falsity joined to impurity of life. How much those persons are in danger of eternal condemnation becomes clear from what 
has been stated above in <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>. Here it means in particular people inside the Church who profane the goods and truths of faith, of whom it is said that 'that soul will be cut off from his peoples'. For 
unlike those outside the Church, they are capable of profaning, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="593.htm">593</a>,<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>,<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>,<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>. </p>

</p><b>2056.</b>
`Et praeputiatus masculus': quod significet qui non in vero fidei, constat a significatione `masculi' quod sit verum fidei, de qua supra n. 2046, quare hic `praeputiatus masculus' significat illum qui 
non in vero fidei, ita qui in falso; `praeputiatum' praedicatur de e quod impedit et conspurcat, sicut prius dictum; cum id adjungitur `masculo,' est id quod impedit et conspurcat verum; similiter 
cum a alicui rei adjungitur, significat ejusdem rei obfuscationem et contaminationem, ut `praeputiata auris' apud Jeremiam, 	Super quem loquar et testificabor, et audient? Ecce praeputiata auris eorum, 
et non possunt auscultare; ecce Verbum Jehovae factum est in opprobrium, non volunt illud, vi 10; </p>
<p>`praeputiata auris' pro quod nulla auscultatio, et quod illis Verbum opprobrio [esset].  [2] Agitur 
in hoc versu etiam de illis qui intra Ecclesiam, qui non solum in falso sed etiam in impuro amorum sui et mundi, nam continuantur praecedentibus, quare dicitur `praeputiatus masculus, qui non circumciditur 
carne praeputii sui,' ita est falsum conjunctum impuro vitae; quantum periculi damnationis aeternae illis sit, ex quae supra {1} n. 2051 dicta sunt, constare potest; hic imprimis significantur 
illi intra Ecclesiam qui bona et vera fidei profanant, de quibus dicitur quod `excidetur anima illa ex populis suis': illi enim profanare possunt, non autem ii qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, ut in Parte Prima 
n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059 ostensum est. 	@1 prius.$ </p>
