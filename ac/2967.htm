<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2967节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2967.</strong>“商人通用”表适合他们的状态。这从“商人”、因而“商人通用”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“商人”表示那些拥有良善与真理的认知之人，而他们的货物则表示那些认知本身。因此，“商人通用的银子”表示尽管可能被接受的真理，或也可说，适合各人状态和能力的真理。谁都能看出，所加上的这个词含有某种奥秘。<br />下面会说明“商人”和“货物”的具体含义，不过，整个词语总的含义乃是这样：凡正被改造和重生的人都被主赋予仁与信，但各人照自己的能力和状态来接受。因为人从小所吸收的邪恶与虚假使得一个人接受被赋予之物的方式不同于其他人的。在人能被重生之前，这些邪恶与虚假必须先被消磨掉。消磨后剩余的属天和属灵生命的量就决定了剩下的东西能被真理照亮，并富含良善的程度。这就是余留，也就是主储存在人里面、那时接受生命的良善与真理。这些良善与真理是从婴幼儿甚至直到改造之时所获得的，并且在这个人身上可能多一些，在那个人身上可能少一些。它们被保存在他的内在人里面，无法被带出来，除非他的外在人被带入与内在人相对应的状态，这种对应状态主要通过试探，以及多种多样的消磨实现。事实上，在违背良善与真理（这就是构成我欲和物欲的渴望的性质）的渴望沉寂之前，属于对良善与真理情感的属天和属灵的渴望无法流入进来。这就是为何各人照自己的状态和能力被改造的原因。这也是主针对往国外去的人以比喻所教导的：<br />他就叫了仆人来，把他的家业交给他们；按着各人的才干，一个给了五千，一个给了二千，一个给了一千。那领五千的拿它们做买卖，另外赚了五千；那领二千的也照样另赚了二千。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.14.htm">25:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.17.htm">17</a>等）<br />对于十个仆人，也是这样教导的：他交给他们十锭银子，好叫他们拿去作生意（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.12.htm">19:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.13.htm">13</a>等）。<br />“商人”表那些拥有良善与真理的认知之人，“货物”表这些认知本身。这从刚才所引用的马太福音和路加福音的经文，以及下面这些经文明显看出来。以西结书：<br />对推罗说，推罗啊，你居住海口，是众民的商埠，交易通到许多海岛，他施人因你多有各类的财物，就作你的客商，拿银、铁、锡、铅兑换你的货物。雅完人、土巴人、米设人都与你交易；他们用人口（soul of man）和铜器兑换你的货物。底但人与你交易；许多海岛作你手下的码头。亚兰人因你的手工品很多，就作你的客商。犹大和以色列地都与你交易；他们用米匿的麦子、饼、蜜、油、乳香兑换你的货物。大马色人因你的手工品很多，又因你多有各类的财物，就拿黑本酒和白羊毛与你交易。威但人和雅完人拿纺成的线兑换你的货物。底但人用骑马的坐垫与你交易。亚拉伯人和基达的一切首领都作你手下的客商，用羊羔、公绵羊、公山羊与你交易。示巴和拉玛的商人与你交易，他们用各类上好的香料跟你交易。亚述人、基抹人与你交易。这些商人以美好的货物与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.3.htm">27:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.24.htm">24</a>）.<br />这几节经文论及推罗，“推罗”表示良善与真理的认知（参看<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节），这从所有细节明显看出来。此处所提到的“交易”、“货物”和“器物”无非是指这些认知，推罗因此被称为“居住海口”的（“水”表认知，“海”表这些认知的汇集，参看<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）。推罗还被称为“众民的商埠，交易通到许多海岛”，也就是说，甚至延伸到那些在敬拜上更遥远的人那里，“海岛”表示更遥远的敬拜形式（参看<a href="1158.htm">1158</a>节）。至于“他施”表示什么，这在前面已解释过（<a href="1156.htm">1156</a>节）。他施的“银、铁、锡、铅”表甚至直到最后的感官真理都井然有序的真理。从前文可以看出“银子”表示什么（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节），“铁”表示什么（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="426.htm">426</a>节），以及“雅完人、土巴人、米设人”又表示什么（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>-<a href="1153.htm">1153</a>，<a href="1155.htm">1155</a>节）。“人口”（soul of man）和那些地方的铜器表示与属世生命有关的事物，“灵魂”（soul）表来自主的一切生命（参看<a href="1000.htm">1000</a>，<a href="1040.htm">1040</a>，<a href="1436.htm">1436</a>，<a href="1742.htm">1742</a>节）；“铜器”表示从那生命所接受的属灵良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。前面解释了“底但”（参看<a href="1172.htm">1172</a>节）和“亚兰”（Syria，参看<a href="1232.htm">1232</a>，<a href="1234.htm">1234</a>节）的含义。“犹大和以色列地用米匿的麦子、饼、蜜、油、乳香与你交易”表示来自主的属天和属灵之物。所提到的其它民族及其货物则表示真理与良善的各种属和种类，因而表示“推罗”所指的那些人具有的认知。<br />智慧和聪明就出自这类认知，这明显可见于以西结书，在那里，经上如此说：<br />人子啊，你对推罗君王说你靠自己的智慧聪明得了资财，得了金银财宝，收入库中。你靠自己的大智慧和贸易增添资财，又因资财心里高傲。所以，看哪，我必使外邦人，就是列族中凶暴的人临到你这里。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.2.htm">28:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.4.htm">4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.7.htm">7</a>）<br />显然，他们交易的货物表示良善与真理的认知，因为智慧和聪明由此而来，并非出自其它源头。故经上说“你靠自己的智慧聪明得了资财，得了金银财宝，收入库中”。不过，若出于自私的目的寻求这些认知，如为了显赫，为了赚取名声或财富，那么它们就没有任何生命可言，那些拥有它们的人也会完全丧失它们。在世时，他们通过信奉虚假而非真理，信奉邪恶而非良善丧失这些认知，在来世甚至会完全推动那些真实事物。这就是为何经上说“又因资财心里高傲，所以，看哪，我必使外邦人（即虚假），就是列族中凶暴的人（即邪恶）临到你这里”。<br />在同一先知书的<br />推罗就像在海中沉寂的一座城；你由海上运出货物，就使许多国民充足；你以许多资财、货物，使地上的君王丰富。你在深水中被海浪打破的时候，你的货物和你中间所有的同伴，就都沉下去了；各民中的客商都向你发嘶声。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.32.htm">27:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.34.htm">34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.36.htm">36</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />关于推罗的预言。沿海的居民当静默无言；西顿的商人横渡洋海的人充满了你；在大水之上，西曷的种、尼罗河的庄稼是她的进项，作列族的商埠。谁策划这事来攻击推罗呢？她是赐自己冠冕的，她的商人是王子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这论述的是推罗的荒凉。<br />“交易”和“货物”同样用来论及“巴比伦”，不过，它们是被玷污的良善的认知和被歪曲的真理的认知。如启示录：<br />巴比伦使列族喝她邪淫大怒的酒，地上的君王与她行淫，地上的客商因她极度奢华就发了财。地上的客商也都为她哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了；这货物就是金、银、宝石、珍珠、细麻布、紫色料、绸子、朱红色料。这些物件的商人藉着她发了财，因怕她的折磨，必远远地站着哭泣悲哀。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“巴比伦”表敬拜，其外在看似神圣，但内在却是污秽的（参看<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1283.htm">1283</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1304.htm">1304</a>，<a href="1306.htm">1306</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>节）。由此明显可知其“交易”和“货物”是什么。<br />“商人”表示为自己获取真理与良善的认知，并由此获得聪明和智慧的人。这可从主在马太福音中的话明显看出来：<br />天国又好像商人寻找好珠子，遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了它。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.45.htm">13:45</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.46.htm">46</a>）；<br />“好珠子”就是仁爱，或信之良善。<br />一切良善与真理的认知皆来自主，这在以赛亚书中有所教导：<br />耶和华如此说，埃及劳碌得来的和古实的货物必归你，身量高大的西巴人必过来归你，也要属你。他们必随从你，又向你下拜，向你祈求你说，神真在你们中间，此外再没有别神！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.14.htm">45:14</a>）<br />这论述的是主的神性人。<br />综上所述，可以看出“交易”，也就是买卖，是什么意思；也就是为自己获取良善与真理的认知，并利用它们获得良善本身 。这良善唯独从主那里获得，这清楚可见于同一先知书：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的，你们也来买了吃；你们要来，买酒和奶，不用银子，也不用付钱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“买”表为自己获取；“酒”表属灵的真理（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>节）；“奶”表属灵的良善（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节）。谁都能看出，“就近水来”在此并不是指就近水，“买”不是指购买，“银子”不是指银子，“酒和奶”也不是指酒和奶，这些事物各自表示在内义上与其相对应的某种事物。因为圣言是神性，其中所用的一切表述尽管都来自尘世和人的感官印象，但都具有与其相对应的神性属灵和属天之物。圣言是以这种方式而非其它方式成为神性启示的。</p>

Current with the merchant. That this signifies adapted to their state, is evident from the signification of the "merchant," and thence of "current with the merchant." A "merchant" in the Word signifies 
those who have the knowledges of good and truth; and their "merchandise" signifies the knowledges themselves; hence "silver current with the merchant" signifies truth, as much as can be received; or 
what is the same, adapted to the state and capacity of each one. That these added words involve some arcanum, anyone may see. [2] Concerning the signification of "merchant" and of "merchandise," something 
will be said presently; but as regards the thing itself the case is this. All who are being reformed and regenerated are gifted with charity and faith by the Lord, but each according to his capacity 
and his state; for there are evils and falsities with which man has imbued himself from infancy, which stand in the way of one person's receiving a like gift with another; these evils and falsities 
must be vastated before the man can be regenerated; and insofar as there is a residue of heavenly and spiritual life after vastation, this can be enlightened with truth and enriched with good. It 
is the remains, which are goods and truths from the Lord stored up with man, that then receive life. These goods and truths are acquired from infancy even to the time of reformation, with one person 
more, with another fewer. These are reserved in his internal man; nor can they be brought forward until his external man has been reduced to correspondence, which is effected chiefly by temptations, and 
by many kinds of vastation; for until corporeal things, which are contrary to them, become quiescent (such as the things of the love of self and of the world), celestial and spiritual things, which 
are of the affection of good and truth, cannot flow in; this is the reason why everyone is reformed according to his state and capacity. This also the Lord teaches in the parable concerning the man who 
went abroad: </p>
<p>     Who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods; and unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability. He that 
received the five talents traded with them, and made other five talents; in like manner he also that received the two, he also gained other two (Matt. 25:14-17, etc.). So too concerning the ten servants, 
to whom were given ten pounds, that they might trade with them (Luke 19:12-13, etc.). [3] That a "merchant" signifies those who have the knowledges of good and truth; and that "merchandise" signifies 
the knowledges themselves is evident from the passages that have just been quoted from Matthew and Luke, and also from those which now follow. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest 
at the entrances of the sea, that art the trader of the peoples unto many isles, Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; in silver, iron, tin, and lead, they 
furnished thy fairs. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, these were thy traders; in the soul of man and vessels of brass they furnished thy commerce. The sons of Dedan were thy traders; many isles were the mart 
of thy hand. Syria was thy merchant in the multitude of thy handiworks. Judah and the land of Israel, they were thy traders; in wheat, minnith and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm, they furnished 
thy commerce. Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of thy handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, in the wine of Helbon* and wool of Zahar. Dan also and Javan furnished 
yarn in thy fairs. Dedan was thy trader in flowing garments for riding. The Arabian and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand, in lambs, in rams, and goats, in these were they 
thy merchants. The traders of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traders in the chief of all spices. Haran and Canneh, and Eden, the traders of Sheba; Asshur, Chilmad, were thy traders. These were thy traders 
in perfect things (Ezek. 27:3, 12-13, 15-24). These things are said concerning Tyre; and by "Tyre" are signified the knowledges of good and truth (see n. 1201), as is plain from the several particulars. 
The "traffickings," and "merchandise," and the "wares" that are here mentioned, are nothing else than these knowledges; and for this reason Tyre is called the "dweller at the entrances of the 
sea" (that "waters" are knowledges; and that the "sea" is a collection of these, may be seen above, n. 28); and is also called the "trader of the peoples unto many isles," that is, even to those who 
are more remotely in worship (that "islands" are the more remote kinds of worship, may be seen above, n. 1158; also what is signified by "Tarshish," n. 1156). The "silver, iron, tin, and lead," which 
are from thence, are truths in their order, even to the last which are sensuous. (What "silver" signifies, may be seen above, n. 1551, 2048; also what "iron" signifies, n. 425, 426,; also what "Javan, 
Tubal, and Meshech," n. 1151-1153, 1155.) The "soul of man," and the "vessels of brass," therefrom, are the things which are of natural life (that "soul" signifies all life that is from the Lord, may 
be seen above, n. 1000, 1040, 1436, 1742; also that "vessels of brass" are the natural goods which receive that life, n. 425, 1551). (What "Dedan" signifies has been stated, see n. 1172; and what "Syria," 
n. 1232, 1234.) That "Judah and the land of Israel" are "traders in wheat, minnith and pannag, honey, oil, balm" signifies celestial and spiritual things from the Word. The other nations and their 
merchandise which are mentioned, are the various genera and species of truth and good, thus the knowledges which are with those who are signified by "Tyre." [4] That they are knowledges from which 
come wisdom and intelligence is plainly evident in the same prophet, where it is thus said: </p>
<p>     Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, By thy wisdom, and by thine intelligence thou hast gotten thee 
riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures; by the multitude of thy wisdom, by thy trading, thou hast multiplied thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches; therefore 
behold I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations (Ezek. 28:2, 4-7); </p>
<p>where it is manifestly evident that the wares with which they traded are the knowledges of good and truth; 
for from these, and from no other source, come wisdom and intelligence; and it is therefore said, "by thy wisdom and by thine intelligence thou hast gotten thee riches, and thou hast gotten gold and 
silver into thy treasures." But when knowledges are for the sake of self, for gaining eminence and reputation, or wealth, then they have no life, and those who acquire them are altogether deprived of 
them; they are deprived of them in the life of the body by embracing falsities for truths and evils for goods; and in the other life they are wholly deprived even of those which are true; and from this 
it is said, "because thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches, therefore behold I will bring strangers upon thee" (that is, falsities); and "the terrible of the nations" (that is, evils). [5] Also 
in another place in the same prophet: </p>
<p>     Tyre is like one that is cut off from the midst of the sea; when thy traffickings went forth out of the seas, thou didst satiate many peoples; thou didst 
enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. Now thou art broken by the seas, in the depths of the waters; thy commerce and all thy company are fallen in the 
midst of thee; the merchants among the peoples hiss at thee (Ezek. 27:32-34, 36). Also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The prophecy concerning Tyre. Let the inhabitants of the isle be silent; the merchants of Zidon 
that pass over the sea have replenished thee; and in [great] waters [the seed] of Shihor, the harvest of the river, was her revenue, and thou wast** the mart of the nations. Who hath purposed this 
against Tyre that crowneth herself, whose merchants are princes? (Isa. 23:2-3, 8); </p>
<p>where the vastation of Tyre is treated of. [6] Of Babylon in like manner are predicated "trading" and "merchandise," 
which are the knowledges of good adulterated, and the knowledges of truth falsified. As in the Revelation: </p>
<p>     Babylon hath made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom, and the 
kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, and the merchants of the earth were made rich by the abundance of her delicacies. The merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for no 
man buyeth their merchandise any more; the merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearl, and fine linen, and crimson, and silk, and scarlet. The merchants of these things who were 
made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning (Rev. 18:3, 11, 15). That "Babylon" is worship the externals of which appear holy while the interiors are profane, 
may be seen above (n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, 1306, 1326); and from this it is plain what its "tradings" and "merchandise" are. [7] That a "merchant" is one who procures for himself knowledges of 
truth and good, and thence intelligence and wisdom, is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls; who, when he had found 
one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it (Matt. 13:45-46); </p>
<p>the "goodly pearl" is charity, or the good of faith. [8] That all the knowledges of good and truth are from 
the Lord, is taught in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over upon thee, and they shall be thine; they 
shall go after thee, in chains they shall pass over, and they shall bow themselves down to thee, they shall pray unto thee. Surely God is in thee, and there is no God else (Isa. 45:14); </p>
<p>treating of the 
Divine Human of the Lord. [9] From all this it may now be seen what is meant by "trading," that is, buying and selling; namely, that it is procuring for one's self the knowledges of good and truth, 
and by means of them good itself. That this is from the Lord alone is taught in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     Ho everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and 
eat; yea come, buy wine and milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1-2); </p>
<p>where "buying" denotes procuring for one's self; "wine" denotes spiritual truth (n. 1071, 1798); "milk," spiritual good 
(n. 2184). Anyone may see that "coming to the waters" here is not coming to the waters, that "buying" is not buying, that "silver" is not silver, and that "wine and milk" are not wine and milk, but 
are that which is said to correspond to them in the internal sense; for the Word is Divine, and to its several expressions which are from the natural world and man's sensuous things correspond Divine 
spiritual and celestial things. In this way and in no other is the Word Divinely inspired. * The Latin has Heshbon. ** Eras; but fuit, n. 1201. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2967</b></p><p><b>2967.</b>
'Current with the merchant' means in conformity with their state. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a merchant', and, from this, of 'current with the merchant'. In the Word 'a merchant' means people 
who possess cognitions of good and truth, while 'merchandise' means those cognitions themselves. Consequently 'silver current with the merchant' means truth to the extent that it can be received, 
or what amounts to the same, in conformity with each individual's state and ability. For the embodiment of some arcanum within this added phrase may be seen by anyone. The specific meaning of 'a merchant' 
and of 'merchandise' is dealt with below, but the general meaning of the whole phrase is this: Everyone who is being reformed and regenerated has charity and faith conferred on him from the Lord; 
but each individual receives these according to his ability and his state. For the evils and falsities which a person absorbs from earliest childhood make it impossible for one individual to receive 
what is given in the same way as any other receives it. Those evils and falsities must first undergo vastation before a person can be regenerated. The amount of celestial and spiritual life left following 
vastation determines how far what is then left can be enlightened with truth and enriched with good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is the remnants, that is, the goods and truths from the Lord stored away in a person, 
that receive life at that time. The goods and truths acquired in the period from early childhood to when reformation takes place are with one person more, with another less. They are preserved in 
his internal man, and cannot be brought out until his external man has been brought into a state of correspondence with the internal, which is effected chiefly by means of temptations, and by many kinds 
of vastation. Indeed until bodily desires which are contrary to goods and truths - as is the nature of desires which constitute self-love and love of the world - become dormant, celestial and spiritual 
desires that belong to the affection for good and truth cannot enter in. This is the reason why each individual is reformed in conformity with his state and ability. This is also the Lord's teaching 
in the parable about a man who went away on a journey, </p>
<blockquote>
He called his servants and delivered to them his riches. To the first he gave five talents, to the second two, and to the third one, to each 
according to his own ability. He who received the five talents traded with them and earned five talents more. So too he who received the two earned two more. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:14-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:14-17</a>, and following verses. </p>
<p>The 
same teaching also occurs in the parable about the ten servants to whom he gave ten pounds to trade with, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:12, 13</a>, and following verses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 'a merchant' meaning those who possess 
cognitions of good and truth and 'merchandise' meaning those cognitions themselves, this is clear from the places which have just been quoted from Matthew and Luke, and also from the following: 
In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Say to Tyre, one that dwells upon the entrances of the sea, she that is the trader of the peoples to many islands: Tarshish was your merchant because of the abundance of all riches; silver, 
iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your wares. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traders in the souls of men - and they gave vessels of bronze for your commerce. The sons of Dedan were 
your traders, many islands were the merchandise of your hand. Syria was your merchant in the multitude of your handyworks; Judah and the land of Israel, they were your traders. Wheat of minnith and 
pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm, they exchanged for your commerce. Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of your handyworks because of the multitude of all riches - in the wine of Helbon and 
the wool of Zahar And Dan and Javan exchanged yarn for your wares. Dedan was your trader in chariot-cloaks.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> The Arab and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of your hand in lambs, in rams 
and goats; in these they were your merchants. The traders of Sheba and Raamah, they were your traders in the best of every spice. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the traders of Shebah; Asshur, Chilmad, was 
your trader. These were your traders in choice wares. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:3,%2012,%2013,%2015-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:3, 12, 13, 15-24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These verses refer to Tyre, by which - as may be seen in <a href="1201.htm">1201</a> and as is evident from all the specific details contained 
in these verses - cognitions of truth are meant. The tracings and merchandise, and also the wares, mentioned there have no other meaning, for which reason Tyre is described as 'one that dwells 
upon the entrances of the sea' - 'waters' meaning cognitions and 'the sea' a gathering together of these, <a href="28.htm">28</a>. Tyre is also called 'the trader of the peoples to many islands', that is, extending even to 
those whose worship is more remote - 'islands' meaning more remote forms of worship, see <a href="1158.htm">1158</a>. What Tarshish means is explained in <a href="1156.htm">1156</a>, while 'silver, iron, tin, and read' from there means truths in 
their own order even to the last, which are sensory truths - what 'silver' means being explained in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, 'iron' in <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>. </p>
<p>What 'Javan, Tubal and Meshech' means is explained in <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>-<a href="1153.htm">1153</a>, <a href="1155.htm">1155</a>, while 'the souls of men' and 'vessels of bronze' from those places mean things that have to do with natural life - 'soul' meaning all life that comes from the Lord, <a href="1000.htm">1000</a>, <a href="1040.htm">1040</a>, <a href="1436.htm">1436</a>, <a href="1742.htm">1742</a>; 'vessels 
of bronze' the natural goods which receive that life, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. What 'Dedan' means is explained in <a href="1172.htm">1172</a>, 'Syria' in <a href="1232.htm">1232</a>, <a href="1234.htm">1234</a>. 'Judah and the land of Israel were your traders in wheat of minnith 
and pannag, honey, oil, and balm' means celestial and spiritual things from the Word. The rest of the nations and their merchandise that are mentioned mean different genera and species of truth and 
good, and so the cognitions that exist with those meant by 'Tyre'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 On such cognitions wisdom and understanding rest, as is quite clear in the same prophet where the following is stated, </p>
<blockquote>
Son 
of man, say to the prince of Tyre, By your wisdom and by your intelligence you have gained riches for yourself and gained gold and silver in your treasuries. By the vastness of your wisdom, by your trading, 
you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up on account of your riches; therefore, behold, I am bringing strangers - the terrible of the nations - upon you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:2,%204-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:2, 4-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
it is quite evident that the commodities with which they traded mean cognitions of good and truth since there is no other source from which wisdom and intelligence may be derived. Hence the statement, 
'By your wisdom and by your intelligence you have gained riches for yourself and gained gold and silver in your treasuries'. But when cognitions are sought for the selfish purpose of becoming pre-eminent, 
and of gaining either reputation or riches, they have no life, and those people who possess them are deprived of such altogether. In this life they are deprived of them by embracing falsities 
instead of truths and evils instead of goods, and in the next life too they are deprived altogether of those things that are true. This is why it is said, 'Because your heart is lifted up on account 
of your riches, therefore I am bringing strangers (meaning falsities) - the terrible of nations (meaning evils) - upon you'. And elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Tyre is like [a city] destroyed in 
the midst of the sea. When your wares came out of the seas you satisfied many peoples; with the multitude of your riches and of your commerce you enriched the kings of the earth. Now you are broken by 
the seas, in the depths of the waters; your commerce and all your company have sunk in the midst of you. The merchants among the peoples hiss at you.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:32-34,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:32-34, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The prophecy 
concerning Tyre. The inhabitants of the island are silent, O merchant of Sidon passing over the sea; they have replenished you. On the great waters the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the river, 
was her revenue and was the merchandise of nations. Who has purposed this against Tyre crowning itself, whose merchants were princes? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:2,%203,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:2, 3, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the vastation of Tyre. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
Merchandise and wares are in a similar way spoken of in reference to Babylon, these being adulterated cognitions of good, and falsified cognitions of truth. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Babylon has given all nations drink 
from the wine of the fury of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her; and the merchants of the earth, have grown rich from the abundance of her luxuries. The merchants 
of the earth will weep and mourn over her, since no one buys their wares any more, wares of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, 
etc. The merchants in these things who were made rich by her will stand far off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:3,%2011,%2012,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:3, 11, 12, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Babylon' means worship, the external features 
of which seem holy but the interior features are unholy, see <a href="1182.htm">1182</a>, <a href="1283.htm">1283</a>, <a href="1295.htm">1295</a>, <a href="1304.htm">1304</a>, <a href="1306.htm">1306</a>, <a href="1326.htm">1326</a>. From this it is evident what its merchandise and wares mean. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'a merchant' means one who 
acquires to himself cognitions of truth and good, and from these intelligence and wisdom, is clear from the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The kingdom of heaven is like a trader seeking fine pearls, who, 
having found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:45,%2046&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:45, 46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A fine pearl' is charity or the good of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 That all cognitions of good and truth 
come from the Lord is taught in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, The labour of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabaeans, men of stature, will come over to you and will be yours. They will follow 
after you, they will come over in chains and bow down to you. To you they will make the supplication, God is with you only, and there is no other besides God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's 
Divine Human. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 From all these places one may now see what is meant by acting as a merchant, or buying and selling, namely acquiring cognitions of good and truth for oneself, and by means of 
these cognitions acquiring good itself. This good is acquired from the Lord alone, as is clear in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money, come, buy, 
and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'buying' stands for acquiring for oneself, 'wine' stands for spiritual truth, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, 'milk' for spiritual 
good, <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>. Anyone may see that here 'coming to the waters' does not mean coming to the waters, nor that 'buying' means buying, nor 'money' money, nor 'wine and milk' wine and milk, but that each of 
these means something corresponding to it in the internal sense. For this is the Divine Word, in which all the expressions used - though fashioned out of things perceptible in the natural world and out 
of man's sensory impressions - have Divine spiritual and celestial things corresponding to them. In this and no other way is the Word Divinely inspired.

`Transeuntis mercatori': quod significet applicate ad illorum statum, constare potest a significatione `mercatoris,' et inde `transeuntis mercatori'; `mercator' in Verbo significat illos qui habent cognitiones 
boni et veri, et `mercatura' ipsas illas cognitiones, inde `argentum transiens mercatori' significat verum quantum recipi potest, seu quod idem, applicate ad cujusvis statum et facultatem; 
quod adjectio haec aliquid arcani involvat, quisque videre potest; de significatione `mercatoris et mercaturae' sequitur: quod autem ipsam rem attinet, illa se ita habet: omnes qui reformantur et regenerantur, 
donantur charitate et fide a Domino, sed quisque secundum suam facultatem et suum statum; sunt enim mala et falsa, quibus se homo {1}imbuit ab infantia, quae obstant quin recipere possit unus 
simile donum ac alius mala et falsa illa prius vastanda sunt quam regenerari potest homo; [2] quantum vitae caelestis et spiritualis post vastationem residuum est, tantum hoc potest illustrari vero 
et ditari bono; sunt reliquiae, quae sunt bona et vera a Domino apud hominem recondita, quae tunc vitam accipiunt; bona et vera acquiruntur ab infantia usque ad reformationis tempus, apud unum plura, 
apud alium pauciora; haec reservantur in interno ejus homine; nec produci possunt priusquam externus ejus homo ad correspondentiam redactus est, quod fit imprimis per tentationes, et per plures species 
vastationis; antequam enim quiescunt corporea quae illis contraria sunt, ut sunt illa quae sunt {2}amoris sui et mundi, {3}non influere possunt caelestia et spiritualia quae sunt {4}affectionis boni 
et veri; haec causa est quod quisque reformetur applicate ad ejus statum et facultatem; quod etiam Dominus docet in parabola de           Homine qui peregre abiit, Et vocavit proprios servos,      
 et tradidit illis opes suas, et {5}uni dedit quique talenta,      alteri duo, et tertio unum, unicuique juxta propriam      facultatem:...qui quinque talenta accepit, negotiatus est cum      illis,

<p>tum etiam de           Decem servis, quibus dedit decem minas, 
ut cum illis       negotiarentur, Luc. xix 12, 13, seq. [3] Quod `mercator' significet illos qui habent cognitiones boni et veri, et `mercatura' ipsas illas cognitiones, constat ab illis locis quae 
adducta, apud Matthaeum et Lucam, tum etiam ab his; apud Ezechielem,           Dicas Tyro, Habitatrix super introitibus maris,      negotiatrix populorum ad insulas multas....Tarshish mercatrix

cognitiones boni et veri, videatur n. 1201, et patet a singulis; `negotiationes et mercaturae,' tum `merces' quae ibi memorantur: nec aliud sunt, ideo vocatur Tyrus `habitatrix super introitibus 
maris'; quod `aquae' sint cognitiones{8}, ac `mare' congregatio {9}illarum, n. 28; et vocatur `negotiatrix populorum ad insulas multas,' hoc est, usque ad illos qui remotius in cultu sunt; quod `insulae'

quae apud illos qui significantur per `Tyrum': [4] quod sint cognitiones ex quibus sapientia et intelligentia, constat manifeste apud eundem Prophetam, ubi ita,           Fili hominis, dic 
principi Tyri,...In sapientia tua, et      in intelligentia tua fecisti tibi opes, et fecisti aurum et      argentum in thesauris tuis: in multitudine sapientiae tuae, in      negotiatione tua, multiplicasti 
opes tuas, et elatum cor tuum      in opibus tuis,...propterea ecce adduco super te alienos,      violentos gentium, xxviii 2, 4-7; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste patet quod `merces cum quibus negotiati' 
sint cognitiones boni et veri, inde enim non aliunde sapientia et intelligentia, quare dicitur `in sapientia tua et in intelligentia tua fecisti tibi opes, et fecisti aurum et argentum in thesauris 
tuis': sed cum cognitiones sunt sui causa, ut emineant et lucrentur aut famam aut opes, tunc nullam vitam habent, ac illis prorsus privantur, in vita corporis falsa pro veris et mala pro bonis amplectendo, 
ac in altera vita illis quoque quae vera sunt, prorsus privantur; inde est quod dicatur `quia elatum cor tuum in opibus tuis,...propterea ecce adduco super te alienos,' hoc est, falsa, `et violentos 
gentium,' hoc est, mala: et alibi apud eundem,           Tyrus sicut excisa e medio maris, in exire      nundinationes tuas e maribus, satiasti populos multos, in      multitudine opum tuarum, 
et commerciorum tuorum ditasti reges      terrae, jam fracta es e maribus, in profunditatibus aquarum,      commercium tuum, et omnis congregatio tua in medio {10}tui      ceciderunt;...mercatores 
in populis frendent super te, xxvii      32-34, 36: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam,           Propheticum de Tyro;...tacent habitatores insulae,       mercator Zidon transiens mare, impleverunt te: et in aquis  
    multis semen Shihoris, messis fluvii proventus ejus, et      {11}erat mercatura gentium: quis consultavit hoc super Tyrum      coronantem se, cujus mercatores principes, xxiii 2, 3, 8; </p>
<p>ubi de 
vastatione Tyri agitur.  [5] `Mercaturae et merces' similiter praedicantur de Babylone, quae sunt cognitiones boni adulteratae et cognitiones veri falsificatae, apud Johannem,           Babylon ex vino 
furoris scortationis suae potavit omnes      gentes, et reges terrae cum ea scortati sunt; et mercatores      terrae ex facultatibus deliciarum ejus ditati      sunt:...mercatores terrae flebunt 
et plangent super ea, quod      merces eorum nemo emit amplius; merces auri, et argenti, et      lapidis pretiosi, et margaritae, et byssi, et purpurae, et      serici, et coccini, etc.:...mercatores 
horum, qui ditati sunt      ab ea, e longinquo stabunt propter metum cruciatus ejus,      flentes et plangentes, Apoc. xviii 3, 11, [12], 15; </p>
<p>quod `Babylon' sit cultus, cujus externa apparent 
sancta, sed interiora profana, videatur n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, 1306, 1326; inde quid mercaturae et merces ejus, patet.  [6] Quod `mercator' sit qui comparat sibi cognitiones veri et boni, et inde 
intelligentiam et sapientiam, constat a Domini verbis apud Matthaeum,           Simile est regnum caelorum homini negotiatori,      quaerenti pulchras margaritas, qui cum invenisset unam      pretiosam 
margaritam, abiens vendidit omnia quae habuit, et      emit illam, xiii 45, 46; </p>
<p>`pulchra margarita' est charitas seu bonum fidei. [7] Quod omnes cognitiones boni et veri sint a Domino, apud Esaiam,  
         Sic dixit Jehovah, Labor Aegypti, et mercatura Cushi et      Sabaeorum, virorum mensurae, super te transibunt, et tibi      erunt; post te ibunt, in vinculis transibunt, et ad te   
   incurvabunt se, ad te orabunt; tantummodo in te Deus, et      nullus praeterea Deus, xlv 14; </p>
<p>ubi de Divino Humano Domini.  [8] Inde nunc constare potest quid sit `mercari,' seu emere et vendere, 
quod nempe comparare sibi cognitiones boni et veri, et per illas ipsum bonum; {12}quod hoc a Domino solo, apud eundem prophetam {13},           Heu omnis sitiens, ite ad aquas, et cui nullum      argentum, 
ite, emite, et edite; et ite, emite absque argento,      et absque pretio, vinum et lac, lv 1, 2; </p>
<p>ubi `emere' pro comparare sibi, `vinum' pro vero spirituali, n. 1071, 1798; `lac' pro bono spirituali, 
n. 2184; quisque videre potest quod hic `ire ad aquas' non sit ire ad aquas, quod `emere' non sit emere, quod `argentum' non sit argentum, nec quod `vinum et lac' sit vinum et lac, sed quod 
tale quod vocatur correspondens in sensu {14}interno; est enim Verbum Divinum, cujus singulis vocibus, quae e naturali mundo et e sensualibus hominis sunt, spiritualia et caelestia Divina correspondent,
