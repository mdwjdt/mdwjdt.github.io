<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5874节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5874.</strong>“埃及人听见了”表甚至直到最后和最低层。这从“听见”的含义和“埃及人”的代表清楚可知：“听见”，即听见大哭的声音，是指对怜悯和喜悦的一种觉知；“埃及人”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节），因而是指最后和最低层，因为人所知道的记忆知识形成其心智的最低层。记忆知识形成这最低层，也就是形成人的记忆和思维的最低层，这在人看来并不明显，因为在他看来，它们似乎构成聪明和智慧的全部。而事实并非如此。它们只不过是储存聪明和智慧之物的器皿，事实上是最后和最低的器皿，因为它们与通过身体所获得的感官印象联结。凡反思自己的思维之人，都能明显看出，它们是最后和最低的。当他探究某个真理时，他所知道的记忆知识在那个时候是存在的，只是不明显；因为那时，他的思维将它们所包含的观念提取出来。他将这些观念从大量散落各处，甚至隐藏极深的记忆知识中提取出来，由此得出某个结论。他的思维越深入，他离这些记忆知识就越远。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：当人进入来世，成为一个灵人时，他的确带着他的记忆知识，但不允许使用它们，原因有很多（<a href="2476.htm">2476</a>，<a href="2477.htm">2477</a>，<a href="2479.htm">2479</a>节）；然而，他思考和谈论起真理和良善来，却远远比在世时要清晰和完美得多。由此可见，记忆知识有助于人形成理解力；不过，一旦这理解力得以形成，他的记忆知识便构成最后和最低层，他不再在这个层面，而是在它上面的层面进行思考。</p>

And the Egyptians heard. That this signifies even to ultimates, is evident from the signification of "hearing," namely, the voice in weeping, as being a perception of mercy and of joy; and from the representation 
of the Egyptians, as being memory-knowledges (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462), thus ultimates, for the memory-knowledges with man are his ultimates. That memory-knowledges are the ultimates 
with man, namely, in his memory and thought, is not apparent, for it seems to him as if they make the whole of intelligence and of wisdom. But it is not so. They are only vessels containing the things 
of intelligence and of wisdom, and indeed the ultimate vessels, for they conjoin themselves with the sensuous things of the body. That they are ultimates is plain to him who reflects upon his thought, 
when he inquires into any truth, in that memory-knowledges are then present, but are not apparent; for the thought then extracts what they contain (and this from very many scattered here and there 
and even deeply hidden), and thus forms conclusions; and the more interiorly the thought penetrates, so much the farther does it remove itself from them. This may be manifest from the fact that when 
man comes into the other life and becomes a spirit, he indeed has with him memory-knowledges, but he is not allowed to use them, for several reasons (n. 2476, 2477, 2479); and yet he thinks and speaks 
concerning truth and good much more distinctly and perfectly than in the world. Hence it may be seen that memory-knowledges are serviceable to man for forming the understanding, but when the understanding 
has been formed, they then constitute an ultimate plane in which the man no longer thinks, but above it. </p>

'And the Egyptians heard' means right through to last and lowest [mental images]. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing' - hearing the voice given forth in weeping - as a perception of mercy and 
joy; and from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, thus the last and lowest [mental images], for the facts a person knows form the lowest 
level [of his mind]. It is not evident to a person that such facts form this lowest level, that is, the lowest level of his memory and conscious thought, for they seem to him to compose the whole of his 
intelligence and wisdom. But they do not. Facts are merely vessels in which matters of intelligence and wisdom are stored; and indeed they are last and lowest vessels, for they link with sensory impressions 
received through the body. The fact that they are last and lowest is evident to anyone who stops to reflect on the way he thinks. When he investigates some truth the facts he knows are at that 
time present yet not apparent; for his thought at that time draws out ideas contained within those facts. He draws those ideas out of great numbers of known facts scattered in this direction and that, 
as well as ones deeply hidden, and by doing this arrives at some conclusion. And the deeper his thought goes, the further away he gets from those facts. This may be seen quite plainly from the consideration 
that when a person enters the next life and becomes a spirit he does indeed take his factual knowledge with him, but is not allowed to use it, for a number of reasons, <a href="2476.htm">2476</a>, <a href="2477.htm">2477</a>, <a href="2479.htm">2479</a>; yet 
his thought and utterances about what is true and good are far clearer and more perfect than when he was in the world. From all this one can see that factual knowledge serves a person in the formation 
of his understanding; but once this has been formed his factual knowledge forms the last and lowest level, and he no longer thinks on this level but on a level above it. </p>

`Et audiverunt Aegyptii': quod significet usque ad ultima, constat ex significatione `audire', nempe vocem in fletu, quod sit perceptio misericordiae et gaudii; et ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' 
quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, ita ultima, nam scientifica apud hominem sunt ejus ultima. Quod scientifica (t)sint ultima homini, nempe in ejus memoria et cogitatione, non apparet, 
videtur ei sicut faciant omne intelligentiae et sapientiae; sed non ita est, sunt modo vasa in quibus illa quae intelligentiae et sapientiae, et quidem vasa ultima, nam conjungunt se cum sensualibus 
corporis; quod ultima sint, patet ei qui reflectit super cogitationem suam, quando inquirit in aliquod verum, quod scientifica tunc adsint sed non appareant, nam cogitatio tunc extrahit {1}quae 
continent, et quidem ex perpluribus huc illuc sparsis, etiam reconditis, et sic concludit; et quo interius vadit cogitatio, eo longius se ab illis removet; {2}hoc manifestum potest esse ex eo quod homo, 
cum venit in alteram vitam et fit spiritus, scientifica quidem secum habeat, sed illis non uti liceat ob plures causas, n. 2476, 2477, 2479, et usque de vero et bono cogitat et loquitur multo {3}distinctius 
et perfectius quam in mundo; inde constare potest quod scientifica inserviant homini ad formandum intellectum, sed cum intellectus formatus est {4}quod tunc illa forment planum ultimum in quo 
non homo amplius cogitat, sed supra illud. @1 i talia$ @2 quod constare satis potest$ @3 clarius et distinctius$ @4 tunc illa formant quasi$ </p>
