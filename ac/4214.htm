<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4214节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4214.</strong>“拉班清晨早早起来”表该良善从主的神性属世层所得的启示。这从“清晨早早起来”的含义和“拉班”的代表清楚可知：“清晨早早起来”是指启示（参看<a href="3458.htm">3458</a>，<a href="3723.htm">3723</a>节）；“拉班”是指诸如存在于外邦人当中的那类良善（<a href="4189.htm">4189</a>节）。从整个思路明显可知，此处所指的是该良善从主的神性属世层所得的启示。至于启示，一切启示皆从主所得，并经由良善而存在于人里面；良善如何，启示就如何。<br />绝大多数人以为被启示的人就是那些能推理良善与真理，或邪恶与虚假的人；并以为他们所受启示的程度，与他们更巧妙、精确地谈论这些事，同时运用众多记忆知识来证实他们所说的，以及利用主要取自感官经验的对比和其它使人信服的陈述方式使他们的主张显得真实、可靠的能力成正比。然而，不管其想象和理解能力有多强，这些推理者根本不能被启示。有两种不同的想象和理解能力，其中一种出自天堂之光，另一种则出自虚幻之光。就外在形式而言，这两种光看上去一样；但就内在形式而言，却截然不同。凡出自天堂之光的，皆存在于良善中，并如在清晰的日光中那样知道某事是否正确。但是，凡出自虚幻之光的，皆存在于邪恶中，也就是在那些陷入邪恶的人当中。他们之所以能推理上述那些事，是因为他们拥有知道它们的某种能力，却没有实践它们的情感；谁都能看出，这等于没有任何启示。<br />关于虚幻之光及其在来世的存在，情况是这样：在世上居于这光的人在来世同样居于这光。他们在那里还是推理良善与真理，并邪恶与虚假，甚至做起这种事比活在肉身时更完美无缺；因为在来世，他们的思维不再因身体和世俗的挂虑而受到抑制和束缚，也不像在肉身和世上时那样局限于其中。不过，对于善灵和天使，而非他们来说，随即显而易见的是，他们的推理是虚幻之光的产物，流入他们当中的天堂之光立刻被转化为这种劣光；以致那在他们当中为天堂之光的，要么被窒息，如当阳光照到某种晦暗之物并变成黑色时的情形；要么被反射回来，如在那些以虚假为原则之人身上的情形；要么被败坏，如当阳光照到丑陋而又污秽的物体上，并产生令人厌恶的颜色和难闻的气味时的情形。那些居于虚幻之光，自以为比其他任何人都更受启示之人的情形就是这样，因为他们能聪明、智慧地推理，即便过着邪恶的生活。<br />至于这些灵人是谁，他们的品性如何，这一点从他们为了骗人而模仿良善时所说的每个音节明显看出来。这类灵人就包括那些否认主，或蔑视祂，在自己中间嘲弄凡承认祂者的人；还包括那些喜欢奸淫，嘲笑凡相信婚姻是神圣的，绝不可遭到侵犯者的人。那些认为教会的诫命和教义是针对普通老百姓，好由此约束他们，而他们自己却无视这些诫命和教义的人，也在这类灵人之列。那些将一切归于自然界，视将它们归于神性的人为头脑简单、判断力低下的人同样在这类灵人之列。那些将一切归于自己的精明，声称并确认以下观念：有一位至高无上的存在拥有对事物的一种总体或整体上的掌控，但没有对它们的具体或特定掌控的灵人也在他们之列。这同样适用于其它情况。<br />像这样的人甚至在来世也居于虚幻之光，就在和他们一样能精确推理的人当中。但当他们靠近任何天堂社群时，这光就会熄灭，并变成黑暗。结果，他们的思维变得如此晦暗、混乱，以致他们实际上根本无法思考。因为天堂之光对他们造成不利影响；如前所述，在他们当中，这光要么被窒息，要么被反射回去，要么被败坏。因此，他们从那里一头栽下去，投入地狱，也就是流行这种光的地方。由此可见何为真正的启示，即它出自源于主的良善；也可看出何为虚假之光，即它出自源于地狱的邪恶。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4214</b></p><p><b>4214.</b>
And in the morning Laban arose early. That this signifies the enlightenment of this good from the Lord's Divine natural, is evident from the signification of "rising early in the morning," as being enlightenment 
(see n. 3458, 3723); and from the representation of Laban, as being such good as is that of the Gentiles (n. 4189). That the enlightenment of this good here meant is from the Lord's Divine 
natural, is manifest from the series. As regards enlightenment, it is all from the Lord, and through the good that is in the man; and such as is the good, such is the enlightenment.  [2] Most people 
believe that those men are enlightened who are able to reason about good and truth and about evil and falsity; and that their enlightenment is the greater in proportion to the subtlety and acuteness 
with which they can speak about these things, and at the same time confirm them by many memory-knowledges, and likewise make what they say appear probable by comparisons, especially those drawn from 
things of sense, and by other modes of persuasion. And yet such men may be in no enlightenment, in spite of their power of imagination and perception. This power is of two kinds, one which comes from 
the light of heaven, and the other from a fatuous light; and in the outward form these two appear alike, although in the inward form they are quite different. That which is from the light of heaven is 
in good, that is, is with those who are in good, and who from good are able to see truth, and to know as in clear day whether a thing is so, or is not so. But that which is from fatuous light is in evil, 
that is, is with those who are in evil; and their being able to reason about such things comes from the fact that they possess some capacity of knowing them, but no affection of doing them; and that 
this is to be in no enlightenment everyone can comprehend. [3] As regards fatuous light the case in the other life is this: They who have been in such light in this world are in the like in the other 
life, and there reason about good and truth and about evil and falsity, and this much more perfectly and excellently than when in the life of the body; for their thoughts are not there beclogged 
and impeded by the cares of the body and of the world, nor so terminated or bounded in them, as when they were in the body and the world. But still it at once appears (not to them, but to good spirits 
and angels) that their reasonings are those of fatuous light, and that the light of heaven that inflows with them is instantly turned into such a light; so that that which was the light of heaven with 
them is either suffocated, as when the light of the sun falls upon something opaque and becomes black; or is reflected, as with those who are in principles of falsity; or is perverted, as when the sun's 
light flows into ugly and unclean objects, and produces repulsive colors and offensive smells. Such is the case with those who are in fatuous light and believe themselves to be more enlightened than 
others simply because they are able to reason intelligently and wisely, while nevertheless living an evil life.  [4] Who these are, and what is their character, appears from everything they speak, 
provided they do not counterfeit what is good for the sake of deceiving. Among them are those who deny or despise the Lord, and within themselves ridicule those who confess Him. Among them are those 
who love adulteries, and who ridicule those who believe marriages to be holy, and by no means to be violated. Among them are those who believe the precepts and doctrinal things of the church to be for 
the sake of the common people, that they may thereby be kept in bonds, and who in themselves make them of no account. Among them in like manner are those who ascribe all things to nature, and believe 
those to be simple-minded and of feeble judgment who ascribe them to the Divine. Among them also are those who attribute everything to their own prudence, and who say, and have confirmed themselves 
in the opinion, that there is a Supreme Being that exercises some government in general or in the universal, but nothing in particular or individually. And so in other cases. [5] Such persons are in 
fatuous light even in the other life, and among their like they also reason acutely; but when they approach any heavenly society, this light is extinguished and becomes darkness; and consequently their 
thought is obscured to such a degree that they cannot think at all; for they are then cramped and constricted by the light of heaven, which as before said is with them either suffocated, reflected, 
or perverted; and they therefore throw themselves down headlong, and cast themselves into hell, where such light prevails. From all this can be seen what true enlightenment is, namely, that it comes from 
the good which is from the Lord; and also what false enlightenment is, namely, that it comes from the evil which is from hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4214</b></p><p><b>4214.</b>
'And in the morning Laban rose up early' means the enlightenment of that good by the Lord's Divine Natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'in the morning rising up early' as enlightenment, dealt 
with in <a href="3458.htm">3458</a>, <a href="3723.htm">3723</a>, and from the representation of 'Laban' as good such as exists with gentiles, dealt with in <a href="4189.htm">4189</a>. It is evident from the train of thought that the enlightenment of this good by the 
Lord's Divine Natural is what is meant here. As regards enlightenment, all enlightenment is received from the Lord; it comes by way of the good present in a person, the exact nature of the enlightenment 
depending on the nature of that good there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Most people believe that the enlightened consist of those who are able to reason about what is good and true, or about what is evil and false, and 
that the measure of their enlightenment increases in direct proportion to their growing ability to speak about those things with greater precision and accuracy, and at the same time to back up what they 
say with many facts, and also to make their assertions ring true by the use of comparisons drawn mainly from sensory evidence and by the use of other convincing ways of presentation. These reasoners 
however, in spite of all their mental and perceptive ability, are incapable of being enlightened at all. Two different kinds of mental and perceptive ability exist, the first of which comes from the 
light of heaven, the second from an illusory light. Both kinds look the same in outward form but are entirely different in internal form. That which comes from the light of heaven exists within good, 
that is, it exists with people who are governed by good. By virtue of that good they are able to see what is true, and to know - clear as daylight - whether something is right or not. But the kind which 
comes from the illusory light exists within evil, that is, with people who are governed by evil. The reason why they are able to reason about the things mentioned is that they do have a capacity 
to know them but no desire to practice them, a situation in which, as anyone can see, no enlightenment is present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 With regard to illusory light and its existence in the next life, the following 
may be said: People who have dwelt in such light in the world dwell in a similar light in the next life. There also they reason about what is good and true, and about what is evil and false, doing so 
indeed far more perfectly and completely than during their lifetime since their thoughts are not held back and inhibited in that life by the cares which belong to the body and the world, nor are they 
so confined within them as they had been when in the body and the world. But it is immediately apparent, not to them but to good spirits and to angels, that their reasonings are the product of illusory 
light and that the light of heaven flowing in with them is instantly converted into that inferior kind of light. That which begins with them as the light of heaven is either stifled, as when sunlight 
falls on something opaque and turns black, or is cast back, as happens with people under the influence of false assumptions, or else is perverted, as when sunlight strikes objects that are offensive 
and foul and produces offensive colours as well as offensive odours. It is similar with people who dwell in illusory light and believe that they are more enlightened than everybody else because of 
their ability to reason intelligently and wisely, even though they lead evil lives. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Who these spirits are and what they are really like is evident from every syllable of what they say, so long 
as they are simulating what is good with the intent to deceive. Such spirits include those who deny the Lord or hold Him in contempt, and among themselves mock those who do confess Him. Also included 
are those who delight in adultery and deride people who believe that marriages are holy and ought never to be dishonoured. Among such spirits too are those who believe that the commands and teachings 
of the Church are intended for the common people, who by means of them may be kept in bonds; but among themselves those spirits set no value at all on those commands and teachings. Likewise included are 
those who attribute all things to nature and suppose people to be simpletons and weak in judgement who claim that all things come from the Divine. Spirits who ascribe every single thing to their own 
prudence, and who have convinced themselves of the idea and say that a Supreme Being exists who has a kind of general or overall control of things but no particular or specific control of them, are 
included too. And the same applies to other cases. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 People like these dwell in illusory light in the next life also, where among those like themselves they reason with precision. But when they approach 
any heavenly community that light goes out and turns into darkness. As a consequence their thought is so beclouded that they are not in fact able to think at all. For the light of heaven there 
has an adverse effect on them, which with them, as has been stated, is either stifled or cast back or perverted. As a result they reel back from there and cast themselves down into hell, where that kind 
of light shines. These considerations show what true enlightenment is, namely that which is a product of good originating in the Lord, and what false enlightenment is, namely that which is a product 
of evil originating in hell. </p>

`Et mane surrexit Laban in matutino': quod significet illustrationem illius boni a Divino Naturali Domini, constat a significatione `mane surgere in matutino' quod sit illustratio, de qua n. 3458, 
3723; et ex repraesentatione `Labanis' quod {1} sit bonum quale est gentium, de qua n. 4189; quod illustratio hujus boni sit a Divino Naturali Domini quae hic intelligitur, patet a serie.  Quod illustrationem 
attinet, est illa omnis a Domino, et per bonum quod apud hominem; talis `etiam' est illustratio quale est bonum.  [2] Credunt plerique quod illi illustrati sint qui ratiocinari possunt 
de bono et vero, et de malo et falso, ac quod in illustrationis statu eo majore (o)sint, quo subtilius et acutius possunt (x)de illis loqui, et simul confirmare per plura scientifica, et quoque illa 
quae loquuntur, verisimilia facere per comparativa imprimis ex sensualibus, et per alios persuasorios modos; hi tamen usque possunt in nulla illustratione esse, tametsi in facultate imaginativa 
et perceptiva (o)sunt; haec facultas est duplex, una quae venit a luce caeli, altera quae a lumine fatuo, utrumque {2} apparet in externa forma simile sed in interna est prorsus dissimile; quod a 
luce caeli, hoc in bono est, hoc est, apud illos qui in bono sunt; hi ex bono possunt videre verum, ac scire (o)sicut in clara die num ita sit, vel non ita sit; ast {3} quod ex lumine fatuo, hoc in 
malo est, hoc est, apud illos qui in malo sunt; quod ratiocinari possint de illis, est quia in facultate aliqua sciendi illa sunt sed in nulla affectione faciendi; quod id non sit in illustratione 
esse, quisque capere potest; [3] cum lumine fatuo ita se habet in altera vita: qui in tali fuerunt in mundo, in simili sunt in altera vita, et ratiocinantur ibi de bono et vero, et de malo et falso, 
et quidem multo perfectius et excellentius quam in vita corporis: nam cogitationes `illorum non retrahuntur et impediuntur ibi a curis quae sunt corporis et mundi, nec ita terminantur in illis, 
sicut dum in corpore et mundo fuerunt; sed apparet ilico, non coram illis sed coram bonis spiritibus et angelis, quod ratiocinia eorum sint lumini: fatui, et quod lux caeli, quae apud illos influit, 
ilico vertatur in tale lumen, quod quae {4} apud illos lux caeli vel suffocatur sicut cum lux solis in opacum quoddam illabitur et fit nigrum; vel quod reflectatur, quod fit {5} apud illos qui in 
principiis falsi sunt; </p>
<p>vel pervertatur sicut eum lux solis in objecta terra et sordida influit, et facit tetros colores et quoque (x)tetros odores; ita se habet cum illis qui in lumine fatuo sunt 
et credunt se prae ceteris (x)illustratos esse, eo quod {6} intelligenter et sapienter ratiocinari possint, et tamen male vivant; [4] quinam illi sunt et quales, apparet a singulis quae loquuntur, 
dummodo non mentiuntur bonum fallendi causa; qui Dominum negant aut contemnunt, et apud se subsannant illos qui Ipsum confitentur, inter tales sunt: qui adulteria amant, et rident illos qui conjugia 
credunt sancta et nusquam violanda, etiam inter tales sunt: qui Ecclesiae praecepta et doctrinalia credunt plebis causa esse ut teneantur etiam per illa in vinculis, ac apud se illa nihil faciunt, 
similiter inter tales sunt: qui naturae tribuunt omnia, et illos simplices credunt ac debilis judicii qui Divino illa vindicant, pariter inter tales sunt: qui omnia et singula suae prudentiae adscribunt,
