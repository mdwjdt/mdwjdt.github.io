<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3164节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3164.</strong>“然后仆人拿出银器、金器和衣服”表真理与良善，以及它们的装饰。这从“银器、金器和衣服”在内义上的含义清楚可知。“银”表真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节），“金”表良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）。此处之所以提及“银器、金器”，是因为它们论及此处“利百加”所表示的对真理的情感。事实上，就本身而言，真理不过是良善的器皿或接受者（<a href="1496.htm">1496</a>，<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2261.htm">2261</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>，<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>节）。“银器”尤指记忆知识，因为记忆知识是真理的接受者；“金器”尤指真理，因为真理是良善的接受者。“衣服”表装饰，这是显而易见的，无需解释。<br />古时，这类事物被送给订婚的少女。这是由于代表和有意义的记号，以便订婚的少女能代表要与良善联结的教会的真理。以西结书也是这样描述初期古教会的：<br />正动爱情的时候，我使你着刺绣服装，用细麻布给你束腰，又用丝绸给你遮身，又用妆饰打扮你，把镯子戴在你手上，把项链戴在你颈上，又把环子戴在你鼻子上，把耳环戴在你耳朵上，把华冠戴在你头上。这样，你就有金银的妆饰，你穿的是细麻衣、丝绸并刺绣服装。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.8.htm">16:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.13.htm">13</a>）<br />当该教会背离真理与良善时，这一章是这样描述它的：<br />你拿了你的一些衣服，为自己在高处做华美的装饰。你又将我所给你的我那些华美的金银、银器取来作装饰，为自己制造男性的像。你又拿你的刺绣衣服给它们遮身。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.16.htm">16:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.18.htm">18</a>）<br />从这些经文很明显地看出来，“银、金和衣服”无非表示属于教会的事物，也就是说，表示真理和良善，以及属于真理和良善的事物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3164</b></p><p><b>3164.</b>
And the servant brought forth vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments. That this signifies truth and good, and their adornments, is evident from the signification of "vessels of silver, 
vessels of gold, and garments," in the internal sense. (That "silver" signifies truth, may be seen above, n. 1551, 2048; also that "gold" signifies good, n. 113, 1551, 1552.) "Vessels" of silver and "vessels" 
of gold are here mentioned, because they are predicated of the affection of truth, which here is "Rebekah;" for regarded in itself truth is but a vessel or recipient of good (n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 
2063, 2261, 2269, 3068); "vessels of silver" specifically are memory-knowledges, for these are recipients of truth; "vessels of gold" specifically are truths, for these are recipients of good; and 
that "garments" denote adornments, is evident without explication. In ancient times such things were given to a virgin when she was betrothed; and this because of the representation and signification 
in order that the betrothed virgin might represent the truth of the church that is to be conjoined with good. So also is described the Ancient Church, in its first age. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     When it was 
the time of loves, I clothed thee with broidered work, I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk, I decked thee also with ornament, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a necklace 
upon thy throat, and I put a jewel upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a crown of adornment upon thy head. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of fine linen 
and silk and broidered work (Ezek. 16:8-13). And when the same church fell away from truth and good, it is thus described in the same chapter: </p>
<p>     Thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for 
thee high places with diverse colors; thou didst take the vessels of thine adornment, of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of a male; and thou tookest thy broidered 
garments, and coveredst them (Ezek. 16:16-18). From these passages it plainly appears that "silver, gold, and garments" denote nothing else than the things which are of the church, namely, truth 
and good, and the things which are of truth and good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3164</b></p><p><b>3164.</b>
'And the servant brought out vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments' means truth and good, and the adornment of these. This is clear from the meaning in the internal sense of 'vessels of 
silver, vessels of gold, and garments' - 'silver' meaning truth, see <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, and 'gold' good, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>. The words 'vessels of silver and vessels of gold' are used because they have reference 
to the affection for truth, meant here by 'Rebekah'. Indeed regarded in itself truth is nothing else than a vessel or recipient of good, <a href="1496.htm">1496</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2261.htm">2261</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>, <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>. Specifically, by 'vessels 
of silver' facts are meant since facts are the recipients of truth, and by 'vessels of gold' truths are meant because truths are the recipients of good. But as for 'garments' meaning adornment, 
this may be seen without explanation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In ancient times such things used to be given to a virgin at her betrothal. They were given to her because of the representation and the meaningful sign 
which denoted that 'a betrothed virgin' corresponded to the truth of the Church that was to be joined to good. This also is how the Ancient Church in its earliest days is described in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
When 
it was the time for falling in love, I clothed you with embroidered cloth, swathed you in fine linen, and covered you with silk, and I adorned you with ornaments, and put bracelets on your hands and 
a chain on your neck, and I put a jewel on your nose, and earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. Thus were you adorned with gold and silver, and your garments were fine linen, and 
silk, and embroidered cloth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:8-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:8-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And when the same Church had departed from truth and good it is described in that chapter as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You took some of your garments and made for yourself 
gaily-decked high places. And for your adornment you took vessels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and you made for yourselves figures of the male. And you took your embroidered 
garments and covered them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:16-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:16-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these places it is quite evident that 'silver, gold, and garments' means nothing else than things that are the Church's, that is to say, truth 
and good, and things that belong to truth and good. </p>

</p><b>3164.</b>
`Et eduxit servus vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes': quod significet verum et bonum, et ornatus eorum, constat a significatione `vasorum argenti, vasorum auri, et vestium' in sensu interno; quod 
`argentum' significet verum, videatur n. 1551, 2048, et quod `aurum' bonum, n. 113, 1551, 1552; `vasa argenti et vasa auri' dicuntur quia praedicantur de affectione veri, quae `hic est `Rebecca,' verum 
enim in se spectatum non est nisi vas seu recipiens boni n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269, 3068; `vasa argenti' sunt in specie scientifica, nam haec sunt recipientia veri; {1}vasa auri sunt in 
specie vera, quia haec sunt recipientia boni; `vestes' autem quod sint ornatus, constare potest absque explicatione. [2] Talia antiquo tempore dabantur virgini cum desponsaretur, et hoc repraesentationis 
et significationis causa quod `virgo desponsata' referret Ecclesiae veram conjungendum bono; sicut quoque describitur Ecclesia Antiqua in (t)sua prima aetate, apud Ezechielem,           Cum esset 
tempus amorum,... vestivi te acupicto, ...      accinxi te bysso, et obtexi te serico, et ornavi te ornatu, et      dedi armillas super manus tuas, et torquem super guttur tuum,      et dedi monile 
super nasum tuum, et inaures super aures tuas,      et coronam ornatus in caput tuum; sic ornata es auro et      argento, et vestes tuae byssus, et sericum, et acupictum, xvi      8-13; </p>
<p>et cum 
eadem Ecclesia a vero et bono recessit, ita ibi describitur, </p>
<p>          Sumpsisti de vestibus tuis; et fecisti tibi excelsa      variegata; et accepisti vasa ornatus tui, ex auro Meo, et ex      argento 
Meo, quod dederam tibi, et fecisti tibi imagines      maris, et sumpsisti vestes acupicti, et texisti eas, vers. 16-18; </p>
<p>ex quibus manifeste patet quod `argentum, aurum, et vestes' non aliud sint 
quam quae sunt Ecclesiae, nempe verum et bonum, et illa quae sunt veri et boni. @1 i et$  </p>
