Verses 10-13. And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather the produce thereof; and in the seventh thou shalt let it lie fallow, and shalt release it; and the needy of thy people shall eat; 
and what they leave the wild animal of the field shall eat. So shalt thou do to thy vineyard, and to thine oliveyard. Six days thou shalt do thy works, and on the seventh day thou shalt cease; that 
thine ox and thine ass may rest; and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may take breath. And all that I have said unto you ye shall keep; and ye shall not mention the name of other gods; it shall 
not be heard upon thy mouth. "And six years thou shalt sow thy land," signifies the first state, when the man of the church is being instructed in the truths and goods of faith; "and shalt gather 
the produce thereof," signifies the goods of truth therefrom; "and in the seventh year thou shalt let it lie fallow, and shalt release it," signifies the second state, when the man of the church is in 
good, and thus in the tranquility of peace; "and the needy of thy people shall eat," signifies conjunction through the good of charity with those who are in few truths and yet long to be instructed; 
"and what they leave the wild animal of the field shall eat," signifies conjunction through these with those who are in the delights of external truth; "so shalt thou do to thy vineyard, and to thine 
oliveyard," signifies that so it is with spiritual good and with celestial good; "six days thou shalt do thy works," signifies the state of labor and of combat when the man is in external things, which 
are to be conjoined with internal; "and on the seventh day thou shalt cease," signifies the state of good when the man is in internal things, and his tranquility of peace then; "that thine ox and thine 
ass may rest," signifies tranquility at the same time for external goods and truths; "and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may take breath," signifies the state of life of those outside 
the church who are in truths and goods; "and all that I have said unto you ye shall keep," signifies that the commandments, the judgments, and the statutes are to be done; "and ye shall not mention 
the name of other gods," signifies that they must not think from the doctrine of falsity; "it shall not be heard upon thy mouth," signifies that obedience is not to be paid with any affirmation. </p>

Verses 10-13 And six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce. And in the seventh you shall let it rest, and let it lie fallow;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the needy of your people will eat, and whatever is 
left by them<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> the wild animal of the field will eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard, with your olive grove. Six days you shall do your work,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> and on the seventh day you shall cease, 
in order that your ox and your ass may rest, and your female slave's son and the sojourner may draw breath.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> And all that I have said to you you shall keep. And you shall not mention the name of other

<p>'And six years you shall sow your land' means the first state, when a member of the Church receives instruction in the truths and forms of the good 
of faith. 'And gather in its produce' means forms of the good of truth that result from it. 'And in the seventh you shall let it rest, and let it lie fallow' means the second state, when the member 
of the Church is governed by good, and so enjoys peace and serenity. 'And the needy of your people will eat' means being joined through the good of charity to those who possess few truths and still 
have a desire to receive instruction. 'And whatever is left by them let the wild animal of the field eat' means being joined through them to those immersed in the delights that go with external truth. 
'In like manner you shall do with your vineyard, with your olive grove' means that this is to be so with spiritual good and with celestial good. 'Six days you shall do your work' means a state of labour 
and conflict, when a person is governed by external delights that must be joined to things that are internal. 'And on the seventh day you shall cease' means a state of good, when the person is governed 
by internal things, and his peace and serenity then. 'In order that your ox and your ass may rest' means the peace and serenity that external forms of good and truths enjoy at the same time. 'And 
your female slave's son and the sojourner may draw breath' means the state of life of those governed by truths and forms of good outside the Church. 'And all that I have said to you you shall keep' 
means that they should carry out the commandments, judgements, and statutes. 'And you shall not mention the name of other gods' means that they should not base their thinking on teachings that present 
what is false. 'It shall not be heard on your lips' means that they should not obey them or in any way affirm them.

Vers. 10-13. Et sex annis seres terram tuam et colliges proventum ejus. Et septimo intermittes eam et dimittes eam, et comedent egeni populi tui; et residuum illorum comedet fera agri; ita facies vineae 
tuae, oliveto tuo. Sex diebus facies opera tua, et die septimo cessabis, propterea ut requiescat bos tuus et asinus tuus, et respiret filius ancillae tuae, et peregrinus. Et omne quod dixi ad vos 
custodietis; et nomen deorum aliorum non memorabitis, non audietur super ore tuo. `Et sex annis seres terram tuam' significat statum primum cum homo Ecclesiae instruitur in veris et bonis fidei: `et colliges 
proventum ejus' significat bona veri inde: `et septimo intermittes eam et dimittes eam' significat statum alterum cum homo Ecclesiae in bono est, et sic in tranquillo pacis: `et comedent egeni 
populi tui' significat conjunctionem per bonum charitatis cum illis qui in paucis veris sunt et usque desiderant instrui: `et residuum eorum comedat fera agri' significat per illos cum iis qui in jucundis 
veri externi sunt: `ita facies vineae tuae, oliveto tuo' significat quod ita sit (x)cum bono spirituali et cum bono caelesti: `sex diebus facies opera tua' significat statum laboris et pugnae {1} 
quando in jucundis externis quae conjungenda internis: `{2}et die septimo cessabis' significat statum boni quando in internis, et illius tranquillum pacis tunc: `propterea ut requiescat bos tuus et 
asinus tuus' {3} significat tranquillum (d)pacis bonis et veris externis simul: `et respiret filius ancillae tuae, et peregrinus' significat statum vitae illorum qui in veris et bonis extra Ecclesiam: 
`et omne quod dixi ad vos custodietis' significat quod praecepta, judicia, et statuta facienda sint: `et nomen deorum aliorum non memorabitis' significat quod non cogitandum ex doctrina falsi: `non audietur 
super ore tuo' significat quod non oboediendum ulla affirmatione. @1 i n. 8510, 8888, cp n. 9278$ @2 in IT$ @3 The following note is interpolated here: videatur quod jejunaverint armenta apud
