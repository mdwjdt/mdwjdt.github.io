<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6945节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6945.</strong>“因为他们必说，耶和华并没有被你看见”表在主的人身里面的神性。这从“说”和“耶和华显现”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指觉知，如前面频繁所述，在此是指那些属于属灵教会之人的觉知；“耶和华显现”是指在其人身里面的主之神性的显现。“被看见”表示显现，这是显而易见的；“耶和华”是指神性本身和神性人身方面的主（参看<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="2018.htm">2018</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5041.htm">5041</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6281.htm">6281</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>节）。“耶和华被看见”表示在其人身里面的主之神性的显现，这一点也可从以下事实明显看出来：祂的神性若不通过神性人身，无法向任何人显现，甚至无法向任何天使显现；神性人身若不通过从祂发出的神性真理，也无法显现。此处内义上所论述的主题是对那些属于属灵教会之人的解救。主降世就是解救这些人（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>，<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>节）；这些人尤其通过主的神性人身得救（<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）。<br />至于这句话，即：属于该教会的人不会有信，也不会接受“摩西”所代表的神之律法所说的话，也就是圣言所说的话，除非他们看见神迹，情况是这样：这些人因属于属灵教会，故不像属天人那样出于良善而拥有对真理的觉知；相反，他们承认他们为自己所证实的其教会的一切宗教教义为真理；这意味着相对于那些属天之人，他们处于模糊之中（<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="6427.htm">6427</a>，<a href="6500.htm">6500</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>节）。这一点从以下事实变得显而易见：他们根本不明白主的人身如何能变成神性，或在这人身里面的神之爱能成就此事。因为他们的思维专注于人性，如同他们在一般人身上认识人性一样；当思想主时，他们也不会从这种思维中退出；所以他们的心智陷入一种缠结当中。这一点从这一事实也变得显而易见：他们也不明白人死后如何能活着，同时还有感觉，如视觉、听觉、触觉和嗅觉，并且在那里能以一个人形存在。当一个人抛弃他的肉体及其感官、肢体时，他就是这样；这一观念在他们看来与真理相去甚远，甚至完全不搭边。他们就这样沉浸在感官所接受的印象，以及这些感官印象所产生的记忆知识和幻觉中。因此，他们若不信肉体会再次与灵魂结合，就根本不信任何复活。<br />由此足以清楚可知，他们在天堂事物上陷入何等的模糊。这解释了为何他们根本无法拥有植入他们的任何信仰，除非主用大力把他们从虚假当中拦回。由于这样一种力量在主降临之前并不存在，只存在于主降临后将祂自己里面的人身变成神性之时，所以他们在主复活（<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>节）之前，无法从他们正被虚假侵扰所在的低地被解救出来，并被提入天堂。正因如此，才说他们不会相信，因而也不接受神的律法，即神的真理所说的话，除非他们看见证据证明这是事实，也就是说，除非他们看见下文所描述的神迹。</p>

For they will say, Jehovah hath not been seen of thee. That this signifies the Divine which is in the Lord's Human, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which frequently 
above), here the perception of those who are of the spiritual church; and from the signification of "Jehovah seen," as being the appearing of the Lord's Divine in His Human. That "to be seen" denotes 
to appear is evident, and that "Jehovah" is the Lord as to the Divine Itself and as to the Divine Human, may be seen above (n. 1736, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2156, 2329, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 
6281, 6303, 6905). That "Jehovah seen" denotes the appearing of the Lord's Divine in His Human, is evident also from the fact that His Divine cannot appear to any man, nor even to any angel, except 
through the Divine Human; nor the Divine Human except through the Divine truth which proceeds from Him. Here in the internal sense the subject treated of is the liberation of those who are of the spiritual 
church. (That these were liberated by the Lord's coming into the world, see n. 2661, 2716, 3969, 6854, 6914; and that these specifically were saved by means of the Lord's Divine Human, n. 2716, 
2833, 2834.)  [2] As regards this statement, that the people of that church would not have faith, and would not receive what the law Divine represented by Moses (that is, what the Word) says, unless 
they saw signs, the case is this. These people, being of the spiritual church, have no perception of truth from good, as the celestial have, but acknowledge as truth every doctrinal matter of their 
church which they have confirmed in themselves, and are therefore relatively in obscurity (n. 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3833, 6427, 6500, 6865), as can also be seen from the fact that they do not 
at all comprehend how the Lord's Human can be Divine; nor that the Divine love in the Human can effect this; for they keep their thought in a human such as exists with man, and they do not recede from 
this thought when they think of the Lord, in such an entanglement are they. The same can also be seen from the fact that neither do they comprehend how man can live after death, and at the same time 
have senses, such as sight, hearing, touch, and smell, and be in a human form there. That such is man when he has cast away his body and its senses and members, appears to them foreign to the truth, so 
enwrapped are they in things of sense, and in the memory-knowledges and fallacies thence derived; and therefore unless they believed that the body will again be conjoined with the soul, they would have 
no belief whatever in any resurrection. [3] From all this it is sufficiently evident in how much obscurity they are as regards the things of heaven; and hence it is that no faith can ever be implanted 
in them unless they are withheld by the Lord from falsities by a mighty force. And as there was no such force before the Lord's coming, but only after His coming, when He had made the Human in Himself 
Divine, therefore they could not be taken out of the lower earth, where they were being infested by falsities, and be taken up into heaven, until after the Lord's resurrection (n. 6914). From this 
then it is that it is said that they would not believe, thus neither would receive what the law Divine, that is, the truth Divine says, unless they saw that it is so, thus unless they saw signs (of 
which below). </p>

'For they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to you' means the Divine within the Lord's Human. This is clear from the meaning of saying' as perception, dealt with often, in this instance the perception 
of those who belong to the spiritual Church; and from the meaning of 'Jehovah has appeared' as the appearance of the Lord's Divine within His Human. The fact that this kind of appearance is meant by 
a visual appearance is self-evident; and the fact that 'Jehovah' is the Lord in respect of the Divine itself and in respect of the Divine Human is dealt with in <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="2018.htm">2018</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5041.htm">5041</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>. That 'Jehovah has appeared' means the appearance of the Lord's Divine within His Human is also evident from the consideration that His Divine cannot 
appear to anyone, not even to an angel, except through the Divine Human; nor can the Divine Human except through Divine Truth which goes forth from Him. The subject here in the internal sense is the 
deliverance of those who belonged to the spiritual Church. Their deliverance was effected by means of the Lord's Coming into the world, see <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>; and these specifically were saved 
by means of the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>. </p>
<p></p>

 The implications of this - that those who belong to that Church will not be in possession of faith and so will be unreceptive of what 
the law from God, represented by 'Moses', says, that is, what the Word says, unless they see signs are as follows: Because they belong to the spiritual Church they do not have a perception of truth from 
good as people who are celestial do. Instead they acknowledge as the truth all the religious teaching of their Church which they have substantiated for themselves, which means that compared with those 
who are celestial they dwell in obscurity, <a href="1718.htm">1718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, <a href="6427.htm">6427</a>, <a href="6500.htm">6500</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>. This is also made perfectly clear by the fact that they do not at all comprehend how the Lord's Human 
is able to be Divine, or that God's love within the Human makes it so. For they fix their thought on what is human as they know of it in people generally and do not diverge from this when they think 
of the Lord; so their minds are in a tangle. The same thing is again made clear by the fact that they also fail to comprehend how a person can be living after death and in that life can have the senses, 
such as sight, hearing, touch, and smell, or can exist there in a human form. The idea that a person is like this when he lays aside his body along with its senses and members appears to them to 
be very far from the truth. Thus they are enmeshed in impressions received by the senses and in factual knowledge and illusions that are products of those impressions. If they did not believe therefore 
that the body is to be rejoined to the soul they would have no belief in any resurrection at all. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may recognize quite clearly how much obscurity they dwell in regarding the 
things of heaven. It explains why they cannot have any faith implanted in them at all unless the Lord withholds them from falsities by great force. And since such a force did not exist before the Lord's 
Coming, only after His Coming when He had made the Human within Himself Divine, they could not be rescued from the lower earth where they were being molested by falsities and be raised to heaven until 
after the Lord's resurrection, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>. This then is the reason why it is said that they will not believe and so will be unreceptive of what the law of God, that is, what God's truth, says unless they 
see proof that it is the truth, which is to say, unless they see signs, described in what follows immediately below. </p>

`Quia dicent, Non visus ad te Jehovah': quod significet Divinum {1}quod in Humano Domini, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius, hic perceptio illorum qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali; ex significatione `visus Jehovah' quod sit apparitio Divini Domini in Humano Ipsius; quod `videri' sit apparere, patet; et quod `Jehovah' sit Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum et quoad Divinum 
Humanum, de qua n. 1736, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2156, 2329, 2921, 3023, (x)3035, 5041, 5663, 6281, (a)6303, 6905; quod `visus Jehovah' sit apparitio (x)Divini Domini in Humano Ipsius, patet etiam ex 
eo quod Ipsius Divinum non apparere queat alicui homini, ne quidem angelo, nisi per Divinum Humanum, et Divinum Humanum non nisi quam per Divinum Verum quod procedit ab Ipso.  Agitur hic in sensu interno 
de liberatione illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, qui quod liberati sint per Adventum Domini in mundum, videatur n. 2661, 2716, 3969, 6854, 6914, et quod illi in specie salvati sint per Divinum Humanum 
Domini, n. 2716, 2833, 2834. 	2 Cum hoc quod illi qui ab ea Ecclesia non fidem habituri sint, nec recepturi quod lex Divina, quae per `Moschen' repraesentatur, hoc est, {2}quod Verbum dicit, nisi 
signa viderint, ita se habet: illi {3}quia ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, non perceptionem veri ex bono habent sicut caelestes, sed pro vero agnoscunt omne doctrinale suae Ecclesiae quod apud se confirmarunt, 
quapropter in obscuro sunt respective, n. 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, (x)3833, 6427, 6500, 6865; quod etiam manifeste constare potest ex eo quod prorsus non capiant quomodo Humanum Domini 
possit Divinum esse, nec quod amor Divinus in Humano hoc facere possit; cogitationem enim tenent in humano quale est apud hominem, nec inde recedunt cum cogitant de Domino; in tali perplexo sunt; etiam 
constare potest ex eo quod nec capiant quomodo homo {4}possit vivere post mortem et tunc habere sensus, prout visum, auditum, tactum, et olfactum, et esse ibi in forma humana; quod homo talis sit cum 
suum corpus et hujus sensus et membra rejecerit, illis apparet a vero alienum; ita implicati sunt sensualibus et inde scientificis et fallaciis; quapropter nisi crederent quod corpus iterum conjungeretur 
animae, prorsus non crederent 3 aliquam resurrectionem; ex his satis manifeste {5}apparet in quanto obscuro sunt de illis quae sunt caeli; inde est quod illis nusquam aliqua fides implantari possit, 
nisi a Domino vi forti detineantur a falsis; et quia talis vis non fuit ante Adventum Domini, sed post Ipsius Adventum cum Ipse Humanum in Se Divinum fecerat, idcirco non prius potuerunt eximi 
e terra inferiore ubi infestabantur a falsis, ac elevari in caelum quam post Domini resurrectionem, n. 6914; inde nunc est quod dicatur quod non credituri {6}sint, ita nec recepturi quod lex Divina, hoc 
est, quod verum Divinum dicit, nisi videant quod ita sit; ita nisi signa videant, de quibus mox sequitur. 	@1 This reverts to what A had first in n. 6942 before it was altered.$ 	@2 quid$ 	@3 qui$ 	@4
