<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9135节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9135.</strong>“是羊群中的一只”表还是内层真理和良善。这从“羊群中的一只”的含义清楚可知，“羊群中的一只”是指属灵真理和良善，因而是指内层真理和良善（参看<a href="6016.htm">6016</a>，<a href="6045.htm">6045</a>，<a href="6049.htm">6049</a>节）。在圣言中，经上有时提到“羊群”，有时提到“羊群中的成员”。就内义而言，“羊群”表示内层良善和源于它们的真理；而“羊群中的成员”则表示内层真理和源于它们的良善。然而，没有人能知道它们之间的区别，除非他知道人在重生期间的两种状态是何性质，即先前的状态和随后的状态。先前的状态是指他通过信之真理被引向仁之良善所在的状态；随后的状态是指他处于仁之良善，并由此处于信之真理所在的状态。先前的状态把人引入教会，好叫他能成为一个教会；当他成为一个教会时，便处于随后的状态。在随后的状态下，与他同在的良善和真理由“羊群”来表示；但在先前的状态下，与他同在的真理和良善由“羊群中的成员”来表示。这解释了为何此处首先提到真理，其次提到良善。关于正在重生，或也可说，正在成为一个教会之人的两种状态，可参看前文（<a href="7923.htm">7923</a>，<a href="7992.htm">7992</a>，<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>，<a href="8506.htm">8506</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8512.htm">8512</a>，<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>，<a href="8772.htm">8772</a>，<a href="8995.htm">8995</a>，<a href="9088.htm">9088</a>，<a href="9089.htm">9089</a>节）。<br />那些在外在人或属世人里面的良善和真理被称为“外层”；那些在内在人或属灵人里面的良善和真理被称为“内层”。之所以后者被称为内层，前者被称为外层，是因为天堂是内在人智慧的源头，而世界是外在人智慧的源头；因为天堂在人之内，世界在人之外，或说天堂从内在与人同在，世界从外在与人同在。“无论是牛、是驴、是羊群中的一只”这句话表示一切外层良善和真理，以及一切内层良善和真理。此外，按照天堂的神性秩序，良善在外在人中是向真理发展的；在内在人中则从真理向良善发展。</p>

Even to one of the small cattle. That this signifies if from interior truth and good, is evident from the signification of "one of the small cattle," as being spiritual truth and good, thus interior 
truth and good (see n. 6016, 6045, 6049). In the Word "flocks" are sometimes mentioned, and sometimes "small cattle;" and in the internal sense by "flocks" are signified interior goods and the truths 
thence derived; and by "small cattle" are signified interior truths and the goods thence derived. But the difference between these cannot be known unless it is known how the case is with the two states 
of man, the former and the latter, during regeneration. The former state is when he is being led by means of the truths of faith to the good of charity. The latter state is when he is in the good of 
charity and from this is in the truths of faith. By the former state, man is introduced into the church, in order that he may become a church; and when he has become a church, he is then in the latter 
state. The goods and the truths with him in the latter state are signified by "flocks;" but the truths and the goods with him in the former state are signified by "small cattle." It is from this that 
truths are here mentioned in the first place, and good in the second. (In regard to these two states with the man who is being regenerated, or what is the same, who is becoming a church, see n. 7923, 
7992, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701, 8772, 8995, 9088, 9089.) [2] Those goods and truths are called "exterior" which are in the external or natural man; and those 
are called "interior" which are in the internal or spiritual man. That the latter are interior, and the former exterior, is because the internal man is wise from heaven, but the external man from the 
world; for heaven is within man, and the world is without him. It is said "from an ox even to an ass, even to one of the small cattle," in order that every exterior good and truth may be signified, and 
also every interior truth and good. Moreover, in accordance with the Divine order in heaven, in the external man good proceeds toward truth; and in the internal man from truth toward good. </p>

'Or member of the flock' means or it is interior truth and good. This is clear from the meaning of 'member of the flock' as spiritual truth and good, thus interior truth and good, dealt with in <a href="6016.htm">6016</a>, <a href="6045.htm">6045</a>, <a href="6049.htm">6049</a>. Some places in the Word use the expression 'flocks', while others use 'members of the flock'. In the internal sense interior forms of good, and truths derived from them, are meant by 'flocks', 
whereas interior truths, and forms of good springing from them, are meant by 'members of the flock'. No one however can know the difference between them unless he knows the nature of a person's 
two states, the prior state and the subsequent state, when he is being regenerated. The prior state is one in which he is led by means of the truths of faith to the good of charity; the subsequent state 
is one in which he is governed by the good of charity and from this by the truths of faith. The prior state brings a person into the Church in order that he may come to have the Church within him; 
and when he comes to have the Church within him he is in the subsequent state. Forms of good and truths residing with him in the subsequent state are meant by 'flocks', but truths and forms of good residing 
with him in the prior state are meant by 'members of the flock'. This explains why at this point truths are mentioned first and forms of good second. Regarding the two states of a person who is 
being regenerated, or what amounts to the same thing, who comes to have the Church within him, see <a href="7923.htm">7923</a>, <a href="7992.htm">7992</a>, <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>, <a href="8506.htm">8506</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8512.htm">8512</a>, <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>, <a href="8772.htm">8772</a>, <a href="8995.htm">8995</a>, <a href="9088.htm">9088</a>, <a href="9089.htm">9089</a>.

 Those forms of good and those truths are called exterior which are in the external or natural man, and those are called interior which are in the internal or spiritual man. The reason why the 
latter are interior and the former exterior is that heaven is the source of the internal man's wisdom, but the world is the source of the external man's; for heaven is present with a person internally 
and the world externally. The words 'whether it is ox or ass, or member of the flock' are used to mean all exterior good and truth, and all interior truth and good. Furthermore the development of good 
in the external man is towards truth, in the internal man from truth towards good, in keeping with Divine order in heaven.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

`Usque ad pecudem': quod significet si ex vero et bono interiore, constat ex significatione `pecudis' quod sit verum et bonum spirituale, ita verum et bonum interius, de qua n. 6016, 6045, 6049.  In 
Verbo nunc dicuntur {1} greges, nunc pecudes, et in sensu interno per `greges' {2} significantur bona interiora et inde vera, at per `pecudes' significantur vera interiora et inde bona; sed differentia 
inter illa non sciri potest nisi sciatur quomodo se habet cum bino {3} statu hominis {4}, priore et posteriore, cum regeneratur; prior status {5} est cum ducitur per vera fidei ad bonum charitatis, 
posterior status est cum in bono charitatis est et inde in veris fidei; per priorem statum introducitur homo in Ecclesiam ut fiat Ecclesia, et cum factus est Ecclesia, tunc in posteriore statu est; bona 
{6} et vera {7} apud eum in posteriore statu significantur per `greges,' at vera et bona apud illum in priore statu significantur per `pecudes'; inde est quod hic vera primo loco dicantur, et bona 
{8} secundo; de bino illo statu apud hominem qui regeneratur, seu quod idem, qui fit Ecclesia, videatur n. (x)7923, 7992, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701, 8772, 8995, 
9088, 9089. 	[2] Bona et vera dicuntur exteriora, quae in externo seu naturali homine sunt, et dicuntur interiora, quae in interno seu spirituali homine sunt; quod haec sint interiora et illa exteriora, 
est quia internus homo {9} sapit e caelo sed externus e mundo; (m)caelum enim est intra hominem et {10} mundus extra.(n)  `A bove usque ad asinum, {11} usque ad pecudem' dicitur ut significetur omne 
bonum et verum exterius, et omne verum et bonum interius; procedit etiam bonum ad verum in externo homine, et a vero ad bonum in interno, secundum ordinem Divinum in caelo {12}. @1 nominantur$ @2
