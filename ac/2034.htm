<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2034节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2034.</strong>“你和随从你的你的种”表所有信祂的人都通过祂而有一个结合。这从“种”和“随从你”的含义清楚可知：前面屡次说明，“种”是指信，“随从你”是指跟从祂，如前所述（<a href="2019.htm">2019</a>节）。之前的主题一直是神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质的融合，而此处的主题是主与那些信祂之人的结合，故“你”这个词被重复提及。因为经上说“你务要守我的约”，之后紧接着就是“你和你的种”。由“你”这个词的重复，以及它与“种”连起来用清楚可知，在内义上所表示的是结合，尤其表示与那些构成种之人的结合。种表仁之信，如前所示（<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节）。信是仁爱本身，这一点可参看第一卷（<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="379.htm">379</a>，<a href="389.htm">389</a>，<a href="654.htm">654</a>，<a href="724.htm">724</a>，<a href="809.htm">809</a>，<a href="916.htm">916</a>，<a href="1017.htm">1017</a>，<a href="1076.htm">1076</a>，<a href="1077.htm">1077</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>，<a href="1176.htm">1176</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="1799.htm">1799</a>，<a href="1834.htm">1834</a>，<a href="1844.htm">1844</a>节）。<br />而且，当论及祂与父的融合时，主同时论及祂与人类的结合，因为这是融合的起因，这一点清楚可见于约翰福音：<br />使他们都合而为一。正如你，父在我里面，我在你里面，使他们也在我们里面为一。你所赐给我的荣耀，我已赐给他们，使他们合而为一，像我们合而为一。我在他们里面，你在我里面。我已让他们认识你的名，还要让他们认识，使你所爱我的爱在他们里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">17:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这些经文表明，在祂自己与父的融合里面，主着眼于祂自己与人类的结合，并且将这种结合放在心里，因为它构成主的爱。事实上，一切结合通过爱实现，爱就是结合本身。<br />还有：<br />因为我活着，你们也要活着。到那日你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.19.htm">14:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这段经文同样表明，在祂的人性本质与其神性本质的融合里面，主着眼于祂自己与人类的结合，这结合就是祂所关注的目的，这结合就是祂的爱。祂的爱具有这样的性质：祂至内在的喜乐就是人类的救赎，人类的救赎被持守在祂自己与祂父的融合里面。约翰福音的这些经文描述了产生结合的东西，就是有了祂的命令又遵守，因而是爱主。<br />同一福音书：<br />父啊，荣耀你的名。于是有声音从天上来，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。耶稣说，这声音不是为我，是为你们来的。至于我，我若从地上被举起来，就要吸引万人来归我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.32.htm">32</a>）<br />“荣耀”表融合，如前所述。在祂自己与父的融合里面，祂关注祂自己与人类的结合。这一点在“我若从地上被举起来，就要吸引万人来归我”这句话中公开声明。<br />无限或至高神性与人类的结合通过主的人性变成神性实现，并且该结合就是主降世的原因。这是一个奥秘，很多人花费大量心思探究它，却不得其解，故不相信它。他们不相信的原因是不得其解，故这个奥秘成了他们的绊脚石。我得以通过进入来世之人的大量经历获知事实的确如此。当这些人中的很多人（绝大多数在世时都是聪明人）只是认为主成为人，表面上和其他人一样，祂遭受痛苦，然而同时又掌管整个宇宙时，带有绊脚石的气场立刻就在他们周围充满。因为活在肉身时，这整个观念已成为他们的绊脚石，尽管那时他们未透露这一点，而是以外在圣洁敬拜祂。因为在来世，内在会曝光，并因他们所放射的气场而显露出来，如第一卷所述（<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>节）。人能从这种气场清楚觉察他们真实的信仰是什么，他们对主的真实想法是什么。<br />鉴于事实就是这样，最好稍微解释这个问题。人里面的一切属天之物，即对神的一切爱灭亡后，对良善的意愿就不复存在，这时，人类就与神性分离了。除了爱以外，没有什么东西会产生结合，当这爱逐渐化为乌有时，分离就产生了。有了分离，随之就有了摧毁和毁灭。因此，那时关于主降世的应许就做出了，即祂要使人性与神性融合，并凭这融合在祂自己里面产生神性藉由爱和仁之信与人类的结合。<br />自第一次应许（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.15.htm">3:15</a>有所论及）的那一刻起，这种爱之信在要来的主里面就产生结合。但是，当爱之信在全世界不复存在时，主就会到来，将人性本质与神性本质联结起来，以便它们完全合而为一，如祂自己所清楚说明的。同时，祂教导真理之道，即凡信祂的，就是凡爱祂的和祂的事物，并居于祂的爱里面的（这爱是对全人类的爱，因而是对邻舍的爱）都会结合并因此得救。<br />在主里面，一旦人性变成神性，神性变成人性，无限或至高神性的流注就会发生在人身上，这流注不可能以其它方式显明自己。另外，凭借这流注，可怕的谬念和恶欲会被驱散，灵人界已充满并因尘世来的灵魂涌入其中而不断充满这些谬念和恶欲。那些受它们驱使的人被投入地狱，从而被分离出去。除非这一切成就，否则人类必要灭亡，因为主藉由灵人统治人类。它们也不可能以其它方式被驱散，因为神性活动不可能经由人的理性概念进入他的内在感官意识。这些东西若不如此被联结，就远在至高神性之下，还有根本不可能向任何人解释清楚的更深层次的奥秘存在（参看前文，<a href="1676.htm">1676</a>，<a href="1990.htm">1990</a>，<a href="2016.htm">2016</a>节）。主在属天天使天堂显为一轮太阳，在属灵天使天堂显为一轮月亮；这太阳是祂爱的属天存在，这月亮是它的属灵存在（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>节）；一切事物，无论总体还是细节，都在祂的视野之下（<a href="1274.htm">1274</a>节末尾，<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>节末尾）。</p>

Thou and thy seed after thee. That this signifies that from Him there is conjunction with all who have faith in Him, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being faith, spoken of several times 
before; and from the signification of "after thee," as being to follow Him (explained above, n. 2019). The union of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine 
Essence, has already been treated of; and the subject here treated of is the conjunction of the Lord with those who believe in Him, and therefore there is a repetition of the word "thou;" for it is 
said, "Thou shalt keep My covenant, thou and thy seed;" and from this repetition of the words in connection with "seed" it is evident that in the internal sense conjunction is signified, and in fact 
with those who are the seed, by which is signified the faith of charity, as shown above (n. 1025, 1447, 1510; and that faith is charity itself may be seen in Part First, n. 30-38, 379, 389, 654, 724, 
809, 916, 1017, 1076, 1077, 1162, 1176, 1258, 1798, 1799, 1834, 1844).  [2] Moreover when speaking of His union with the Father, the Lord speaks immediately and without a break of His conjunction with 
the human race; because this was the cause of the union, as is evident in John: </p>
<p>     That they all may be one, as Thou Father art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us; the glory which 
Thou hast given Me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them, and Thou in Me, for I have made known unto them Thy name, and will make it known, that the love wherewith 
Thou hast loved Me may be in them (John 17:21, 22, 26) from which it is evident that in the union of Himself with the Father the Lord had in view the conjunction of Himself with the human race, and that 
He had this at heart, because it was His love; for all conjunction is effected by means of love, love being conjunction itself.  [3] Again in the same gospel: </p>
<p>     Because I live, ye shall live 
also in that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in Me, and I in you; he that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me (John 14:19-21); </p>
<p>from which in like manner 
it is evident that in the union of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence the Lord had in view the conjunction of Himself with the human race, and that this was His end, and this His love, which was 
such that the salvation of the human race, as held in the union of Himself with His Father, was to Him the inmost joy. There is also here described that which unites, namely, to have and to do His commandments, 
and thereby to love the Lord. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     Father, glorify Thy name; there came therefore a voice from heaven, I have both glorified and will glorify it again. Jesus said, This voice 
hath not come for My sake, but for your sakes. But I, when I shall be lifted up from the earth, will draw all after Me (John 12:28, 30, 32) by "glorification" is meant union, as before said; and that 
in the union of Himself with the Father He regarded the conjunction of Himself with the human race, is openly said in the words, "when I shall be lifted up, I will draw all after Me."  [5] That conjunction 
of the Infinite or Supreme Divine with the human race was effected through the Lord's Human made Divine, and that this conjunction was the cause of the Lord's coming into the world, is an arcanum 
into which many inquire in their own minds, and because they do not comprehend, they do not believe it; and as they do not believe for the reason that they do not comprehend, it becomes a scandal or 
stumbling-block to them. That this is so, I have learned from much experience from those who come into the other life. Very many of these-almost the greater part of those who had been men of talent 
in the world-when they merely think that the Lord became a man, and in external form was like other men, that He suffered, and that nevertheless He rules the universe, at once fill the sphere with scandals, 
because this had been a scandal or stumbling-block to them in the life of the body; although at that time they had divulged nothing about it, and had adored Him with outward sanctity. For in the 
other life the interiors are open, and are made manifest by the sphere diffused from them (treated of in Part First, n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504). In this way it is plainly perceived of what faith they 
had been, and what they had thought concerning the Lord.  [6] Seeing that such is the case, it may be well to explain the matter a little further. After all the celestial in man had perished, that 
is, all love to God, so that there was no longer any will of good, the human race had then been separated from the Divine; for nothing effects conjunction except love, and when this had been annihilated, 
there was disjunction; and when there is disjunction, then destruction and extirpation follow. Therefore the promise was then made respecting the Lord's coming into the world, who should unite the 
Human to the Divine, and by this union should effect in Himself the conjunction of the human race by means of the faith of love and of charity.  [7] From the time of the first promise (spoken of in 
Gen. 3:15) the faith of love in the Lord who was to come effected conjunction. But when there was no longer any faith of love remaining in the whole world, then the Lord came and united the Human Essence 
to the Divine Essence, so that they were altogether one, as He Himself clearly says; and at the same time He taught the way of truth, that everyone who should believe in Him-that is, who should love 
Him and the things that are His, and who should be in His love which is love toward the universal human race, thus in love toward the neighbor-should be conjoined and saved.  [8] When, in the Lord, 
the Human was made Divine, and the Divine Human, the result was an influx of the Infinite or Supreme Divine with man that otherwise could not possibly have existed; and an additional result was the 
dispersion of the direful persuasions of falsity and the direful cupidities of evil with which the world of spirits was brimful, and with which it was continually being filled full from the souls arriving 
from the world; and they who were in those persuasions and cupidities were cast into hell, and thereby were separated. Unless this had been done, the human race would have perished, for the Lord 
rules the human race by means of spirits. Nor could they have been dispersed in any other way, for no operation of the Divine was possible through man's rational things into those of internal sense, because 
these are far below the Supreme Divine when not so united; not to mention still deeper arcana that cannot be explained to the apprehension of any man. (See what was said above, n. 1676, 1990, that 
in the heaven of the celestial angels the Lord appears as a sun, and in the heaven of the spiritual angels as a moon; and that the Sun is the celestial of His love, and the Moon the spiritual of His 
love, n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531 and that all things both in general and in particular are under His view, n. 1274e, 1277e.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2034</b></p><p><b>2034.</b>
'You and your seed after you' means that from Him there is a conjunction of all who have faith in Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as faith, dealt with frequently above, and from the meaning 
of 'after you' as following Him, dealt with above in <a href="2019.htm">2019</a>. Previously the subject has been the union of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence and of Human Essence with Divine Essence. But now 
it is the conjunction of the Lord with those who believe in Him, which is also why the word 'you' is repeated, that is to say, 'you shall keep My covenant' followed by 'you and your seed'. From this 
repetition of 'you' and from the coupling of it with 'seed' it is clear that in the internal sense conjunction is meant, in particular conjunction with those who constitute the seed, which has been shown 
in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, to mean the faith that inheres in charity. And the fact that faith is charity itself, see Volume One, in <a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="379.htm">379</a>, <a href="389.htm">389</a>, <a href="654.htm">654</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a>, <a href="809.htm">809</a>, <a href="916.htm">916</a>, <a href="1017.htm">1017</a>, <a href="1076.htm">1076</a>, <a href="1077.htm">1077</a>, <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, <a href="1176.htm">1176</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="1799.htm">1799</a>, <a href="1834.htm">1834</a>, <a href="1844.htm">1844</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Furthermore when the Lord speaks of the union of Himself with the Father He is at one and the same time speaking about His own conjunction with the human race since this 
was the reason for the union, as is clear in John, </p>
<blockquote>
That they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us. The glory which You have given Me I have given 
to them, that they may be one even as We are one, I in them and You in Me. For I made known to them Your name, and I will make it known, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:21-23,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:21-23, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These verses show that in the union of Himself with His Father the Lord had conjunction of Himself with the human race in view, and had this conjunction at heart because it constituted 
His love. Indeed all conjunction comes about through love, love being conjunction itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Elsewhere in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Because I live you will live also; in that day you will know that 
I am in the Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and does them, he it is who loves Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:19-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This similarly shows that in the union of His Human Essence with 
the Divine Essence the Lord had in view the conjunction of Himself with the human race, and that this was His end in view, and this His love, which was such that His inmost joy was the salvation of the 
human race, which He had had in view in the union of Himself with His Father. These verses from John describe what it is that effects union, namely having His commandments and doing them, which is 
loving the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Father, glorify Your name. A voice therefore came from heaven, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. Jesus said, Not for My sake has this voice 
come but for yours. But I, when I have been lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:28,%2030,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:28, 30, 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Glorification' is used to mean union, as stated already. And the fact that 
in the union of Himself with the Father He had the conjunction of Himself with the human race in view is stated openly in the words, 'When I have been lifted up I will draw all men to Myself'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
As for the conjunction of the Infinite, or Supreme Divine, with the human race being accomplished through the Lord's Human made Divine, and as for this conjunction being the reason for the Lord's 
Coming into the world, this is an arcanum to which many apply their minds, but because it is beyond their grasp they do not believe it. And since they do not believe it, for the reason that they cannot 
grasp it, that arcanum becomes a stumbling-block to them. That this is so I have been given to know from much experience of people entering the next life. Very many of these - the majority of clever 
people in the world - when they merely think that the Lord became man and was in outward appearance like any other human being, and that He suffered, and yet is at the same time governing the universe, 
immediately fill the sphere around them with stumbling-blocks. The reason they do so is that to them this whole idea had been a stumbling-block during their lifetime, though they had not then made 
this public but had worshipped Him in outward expressions of holiness. For in the next life the things that are interior are laid bare and revealed by the sphere that emanates from them, dealt with in 
Volume One, in <a href="1048.htm">1048</a>. <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="1504.htm">1504</a>. From this sphere one perceives quite plainly what their faith had really been and what they had really thought about the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 This being so let the matter 
be explained a little further. After everything celestial with man perished, that is, all love to God, so that as a result the will for what is good existed no longer, the human race was separated 
from the Divine. For nothing other than love effects conjunction, and when love has been reduced to nothing, disjunction has taken place. And when the latter has taken place destruction and annihilation 
follow. At that point therefore a promise was given concerning the Lord's Coming into the world, who was to unite the Human to the Divine, and by means of this union was to join [to the Divine] the 
human race that was abiding in Himself through faith grounded in love and charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From the time of that first promise given in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3:15</a>, this kind of faith in the Lord who was to come was conjunctive. 
But once faith springing from love did not remain any more in the world the Lord came and united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence so that these were completely one, as He Himself states 
explicitly. At the same time He taught the way of truth to the effect that everyone who believed in Him, that is, who loved Him and what was His, and who abided in His love, which is a love directed 
towards the entire human race and so towards the neighbour, would be conjoined and thus saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Once the Human had been made Divine, and the Divine made Human in the Lord, an influx of the Infinite, 
or the Supreme Divine, took place with man which could not possibly have manifested itself in any other way. Also by means of that influx the dreadful false persuasions and the dreadful desires 
for evil were dispersed with which the world of spirits had been filled and was constantly being filled by souls streaming into it from the world; and those who were actuated by such persuasions and 
evil desires were cast into hell and so separated. Unless this had been done the human race would have perished, for it is by means of spirits that the Lord rules the human race. They could not have 
been dispersed in any other way because there was no activity of the Divine by way of man's rational concepts into his inner sensory awareness, for these are far below the Supreme Divine when not so united. 
Still deeper arcana exist which cannot possibly be explained intelligibly to anyone. See what has appeared already in <a href="1676.htm">1676</a>, <a href="1990.htm">1990</a>, <a href="2016.htm">2016</a>. That the Lord appears as the Sun in the heaven of celestial 
angels and as the Moon in the heaven of spiritual angels, and that the Sun is the celestial existence of His love and the Moon the spiritual existence of it, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>; and that every 
single thing comes beneath His gaze, <a href="1274.htm">1274</a> (end), <a href="1277.htm">1277</a> (end)

Ego vivo, et vos vivetis; in illa die cognoscetis vos, quod Ego in Patre, et vos in Me, et Ego in vobis; qui habet praecepta Mea, et facit illa, ille amat Me, xiv 19-21; </p>
<p>inde similiter patet quod Dominus 
in unione Humanae Suae Essentiae cum Divina, spectaverit Sui conjunctionem cum genere humano, et quod haec finis et haec amor Ipsius, qui talis quod intimum gaudium Ipsi fuerit salvatio generis humani 
spectata in unione Sui cum Patre ipsius; et describitur hic quoque quid unit, nempe habere praecepta et facere illa, ita {3} amare Dominum: [4] apud eundem, 	Pater, glorifica (t)nomen Tuum; exiit 
igitur vox e caelo, Et glorificavi, et iterum glorificabo:... Jesus dixit, Non propter Me haec vox facta, sed propter vos:  Ego vero dum {4} exaltatus fuero e terra, omnes traham post Me, xii 28, 30, 
32; </p>
<p>per `glorificationem' intelligitur unio, ut prius dictum; et quod in unione Sui cum Patre spectaverit conjunctionem Sui cum genere humano, aperte dicitur, nempe `dum exaltatus fuero, omnes traham 
post Me.'  [5] Quod conjunctio facta Infiniti seu Supremi Divini, per Humanum Domini factum Divinum, cum genere humano, et quod haec conjunctio fuerit causa Adventus Domini in mundum, est arcanum 
in quod plures apud se inquirunt, et quia non capiunt, non credunt; et quia non credunt ex eo quod non capiant, id illis scandalum fit; quod ita sit, ex multa experientia scire datum ab illis qui in alteram 
vitam veniunt; permulti eorum sunt, paene maxima pars ingeniosorum in mundo, dum modo cogitant quod Dominus factus homo et fuerit sicut alius homo externa forma, quodque {5} passus, et tamen regat 
universum, ilico opplent sphaeram scandalis, ex causa quia hoc illis scandalum fuit in vita corporis, tametsi (t)nihil tunc de eo evulgarunt, et tametsi Ipsum externa sanctitate adorarunt; in altera 
enim' vita interiora patent et manifestantur per sphaeram ab illis diffusam, de qua in Parte Prima n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504; inde percipitur manifeste qua fide fuerunt et quid cogitarunt de Domino: 
[6] cum ita sit, paucis licet adhuc exponere quomodo se res habet; postquam omne caeleste apud hominem periit, hoc est, omnis amor in Deum, sic ut voluntas boni nulla amplius, tunc separatum est genus 
humanum a Divino; nihil enim conjungit quam amor, quo facto nullo, facta est disjunctio, et cum disjunctio, sequitur interitus et exstirpatio; quare tunc promissio facta de Adventu Domini in mundum, 
Qui uniret Humanum Divino et per hanc unionem conjungeret genus humanum in Se Ipso per fidem amoris et charitatis; [7] a tempore primae promissionis, de qua Gen. iii 15, fides amoris in venturum Dominum 
conjunxit, at cum nulla amplius fides amoris residua fuit in orbe terrarum, tunc Dominus venit, et Humanam Essentiam univit Divinae, ita ut prorsus unum essent, sicut Ipse clare dicit; et simul docuit 
viam veritatis quod omnis qui crederet in Ipsum, hoc est, amaret Ipsum et quae Ipsius sunt, et esset in amore Ipsius qui est erga (o)universum genus humanum, ita erga proximum, conjungeretur et 
[sic] salvaretur: [8] cum Humanum Divinum factum, et Divinum Humanum in Domino, tunc influxus Infiniti seu {6} Supremi Divini factus apud hominem, qui nusquam aliter potuisset existere; inde quoque discussae 
sunt dirae persuasiones falsi et dirae cupiditates mali quibus mundus spirituum oppletus fuit, et ab animabus e mundo alluentibus continue opplebatur; et ii qui in illis erant, conjecti in inferna, 
et sic separati; quod nisi factum fuisset, periisset humanum genus, nam hoc per spiritus regitur a Domino; nec aliter discuti potuerunt, nam nulla operatio dabatur Divini {7} per rationalia in sensualia 
interna hominis {8}, sunt enim longe intra Supremum Divinum non ita unitum: praeter arcaniora adhuc quae nusquam ad captum alicujus hominis edici possunt, videantur quae prius n. 1676, 1990, 
2016; quod Dominus sicut Sol appareat in caelo caelestium et sicut Luna in caelo spiritualium angelorum, et quod Sol sit caeleste amoris Ipsius et quod Luna spirituale amoris, n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531;
