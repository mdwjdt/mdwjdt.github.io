<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6827节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6827.</strong>“摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群”表从神来的律法教导那些处于简单良善的真理之人，“米甸祭司”是指这些人所在教会的良善。这从“摩西”的代表，以及“牧养”、“羊群”、“岳父”和“米甸祭司”的含义清楚可知。“摩西”是指神之律法方面的主（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节）；最初“摩西”代表从神来的律法所拥有的真理方面的主（<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>节），但在此代表该律法本身方面的主。因此，可以说是在就其人身而言，主成为神的律法本身之前，在主里面所进行的发展阶段。就至内或至高意义而言，整部圣言唯独论述主，论述祂人身的荣耀。但由于至内或至高意义远远超出人类的理解，所以在此解释圣言的内义，内义所论述的主题是主的国度，教会和教会的建立，以及主对教会成员的重生。内义之所以论述这些主题，是因为人的重生是主荣耀的一个形像代表（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3245.htm">3245</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。<br />“牧养”是指教导（<a href="3795.htm">3795</a>，<a href="5201.htm">5201</a>节）；“羊群”是指学习并通过真理被引向良善的人（<a href="343.htm">343</a>节），因此“羊群”在一般意义上是指教会（<a href="3767.htm">3767</a>，<a href="3768.htm">3768</a>节），在此是指由“米甸”所表示的那些处于简单良善的真理之人（<a href="3242.htm">3242</a>，<a href="4756.htm">4756</a>节）所在的教会；“岳父”是指良善，与真理，即与此处“摩西”所代表的从神来的律法所拥有的真理（参看<a href="6793.htm">6793</a>节）结合的良善就源于这良善，如同源于一个父亲，“叶忒罗”是指该良善的品质；“米甸祭司”是指那些处于简单良善的真理之人所在教会的良善（<a href="6775.htm">6775</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群”表示从神来的律法教导那些处于简单良善的真理之人，“米甸祭司”是指这些人所在教会的良善。</p>

And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. That this signifies that the law from the Divine was instructing those who were in the truth of simple good; and that 
"the priest of Midian" is the good of the church where such are, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to the law Divine (see n. 6752); and in the beginning as to the truth 
which is of the law from the Divine (n. 6771); but here as to the law from the Divine. So may we name the degrees of progression in the Lord, before, as to the Human, He was made the very law Divine. 
In the whole Word, in its inmost or supreme sense, the Lord alone and the glorification of His Human are treated of; but as the inmost or supreme sense transcends human understanding, it is allowable 
to unfold the Word as to its internal sense, in which are treated of the Lord's kingdom and the church, and the setting up of the latter, and also the regeneration of the man of the church by the Lord. 
That these subjects are treated of in the internal sense, is because the regeneration of man is a representative image of the glorification of the Lord (n. 3138, 3212, 3245, 3246, 3296, 3490, 4402, 
5688). [2] From the signification of "to feed," as being to instruct (n. 3795, 5201); from the signification of a "flock," as being one who learns and is led by means of truth to the good of charity 
(n. 343), thus the "flock" in the general sense is the church (n. 3767, 3768), here the church where are those who are in the truth of simple good, who are signified by "Midian" (n. 3242, 4756); from 
the signification of "father-in-law," as being the good from which, as from a father, comes forth that good which has been conjoined with truth, here with the truth which is of the law from the Divine, 
which is represented by Moses (see n. 6793), the quality of this good is "Jethro;" and from the signification of the "priest of Midian," as being the good of the church where are they who are in 
the truth of simple good (n. 6775). From all this it is evident that by "Moses was feeding the flock of his father-in-law, the priest of Midian," is signified that the law from the Divine was instructing 
those who were in the truth of simple good; and that the "priest of Midian" is the good of the church where such are. </p>

'And Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian' means that the law from God instructed those who were guided by the truth that went with simple good, 'the priest of 
Midian' being the good of the Church where those people were. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the Lord in respect of the law of God, dealt with in <a href="6752.htm">6752</a> (initially 'Moses' represented 
the Lord in respect of the truth that the law from God possessed, <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, but here he represents Him in respect of that law itself - one is allowed to speak in this way of stages of development that 
took place in the Lord before He became the law of God itself in respect of His Human. The whole of the Word deals in its inmost or highest sense solely with the Lord and the glorification of His Human; 
but since that inmost or highest sense goes far beyond human understanding, let it be the internal sense of the Word that is explained here, the sense in which the subject is the Lord's kingdom, 
the Church and the establishment of it, and also the regeneration by the Lord of members of the Church. These are the subject in the internal sense because human regeneration is an image representative 
of the Lord's glorification, see <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3245.htm">3245</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>);  </p>

here the truth that the law from God possessed, which 'Moses' represents, see <a href="6793.htm">6793</a> ('Jethro' being the essential nature of that good); and from the meaning of' the priest of Midian' as the good 
of the Church where those who were guided by the truth that went with simple good were, dealt with in <a href="6775.htm">6775</a> From all this it is evident that 'Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the
