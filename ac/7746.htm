<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7746.</strong>不过，尽管他们以为其他人不明白他们彼此在谈论什么，但天使灵仍觉察出他们所说的一切细节。原因在于，他们所想的任何东西都不可能瞒过天使灵，这一点也通过活生生的经历证明给他们。我开始思想这一事实：我们地球灵在骚扰他人的时候，不会感到羞愧，这个想法就是从天使灵那里流到我这里的。当时，这些火星灵承认，这正是他们彼此交谈的内容，并感到震惊。此外，一个天使灵就能揭开他们交谈和思考的许多事，无论他们如何努力地使自己的思维远离他。</p>

But although they suppose that their speech is not understood by others, angelic spirits nevertheless perceive everything that they say; because no thought can be withheld from angelic spirits, as was 
also shown them by living experience. I was thinking of the fact that the spirits of our earth are not affected with shame when they infest others, and this thought flowed in with me from angelic spirits. 
The spirits of Mars then acknowledged that this was what they were talking about among themselves, and they were astonished. Many other things also which they both spoke and thought were disclosed 
by an angelic spirit, no matter how diligently they endeavored to withhold their thoughts from him. </p>

But although they imagine that what they are talking about to one another is not understood by others, angelic spirits in fact perceive every detail of what they are saying. The reason for this is that 
it is impossible for them to withhold anything they think from them, as the following experience was to demonstrate to them. I began to think about the fact that spirits belonging to our planet feel 
no shame when they molest others, and this thought was coming to me from angelic spirits. The Martian spirits then admitted that this was what they were talking about to one another, and were astonished. 
In addition to this an angelic spirit disclosed many other things they were both talking and thinking about, in spite of the efforts they made to keep their thoughts from him. </p>

Sed tametsi putant quod non intelligatur ab aliis quid inter se loquuntur, usque tamen spiritus angelici omnia et singula quae loquuntur percipiunt; causa est quia ab illis subtrahi cogitatio aliqua 
non potest; hoc quoque ostendebatur illis per vivam experientiam; cogitabam de eo quod spiritus nostrae telluris non afficiantur pudore cum infestant alios; etiam hoc influebat apud me a spiritibus angelicis; 
spiritus Martis tunc agnoscebant quod id esset de quo inter se loquebantur ac mirati sunt; praeterea a spiritu angelico detegebantur plura quae et loquebantur et quae cogitabant, utcumque satagebant 
{1}cogitationes illi subducere. 	@1 cogitationem illis$ </p>
