<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9835节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9835.</strong>“用巧思者的手工”表出于理解力。这从“巧思者”的含义清楚可知，“巧思者”是指理解力（<a href="9598.htm">9598</a>，<a href="9688.htm">9688</a>节），故“巧思者的手工”表示出于理解力的东西。“巧思者”之所以表示理解力，是因为思维属于理解力，正如爱与情感属于意愿。就内义而言，“巧思者”与“思维”具有同样的含义；因为内义不关注这个人，只关注所表示的实际事物本身，“巧思者”带有一个人的观念（关于这个主题，可参看<a href="5225.htm">5225</a>，<a href="5287.htm">5287</a>，<a href="5434.htm">5434</a>，<a href="8343.htm">8343</a>，<a href="8985.htm">8985</a>，<a href="9007.htm">9007</a>节）。必须简要说明“出于理解力”是什么意思。此处论述的主题是主的属灵国度；就其中的一切真理和良善而言，该国度属于心智的理解力部分；而主的属天国度中的真理和良善属于意愿部分。因为宇宙中的一切事物都与两样事物有关，即良善和真理；这就是为何人里面有两种官能，即意愿和理解力。意愿的存在是为了良善，理解力的存在是为了真理；因为意愿是良善的接受者，理解力是真理的接受者。<br />天堂的情况也一样。那里有两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度。属天国度是为接受良善而存在的，属灵国度是为接受真理而存在的。由于整个天堂对应于人里面的一切事物，所以在主面前，天堂就像一个完整的人，这个人也拥有两种官能，即一个意愿和一个理解力；其意愿在属天国度，其理解力在属灵国度。由于亚伦的衣服代表属灵国度，而天堂的理解力部分不在该国度，所以“巧思者的手工”表示理解力部分。整个天堂凭着它与人里面的每一个事物的对应关系而就像一个完整的人，被称为大人（可参看<a href="9276.htm">9276</a>e节所提到的地方）。与那些在主的属灵国度中的人同在的良善和真理被铭刻于他们心智的理解力部分；但与那些在属天国度中的人同在的良善和真理则被铭刻于意愿部分（可参看<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>，<a href="9596.htm">9596</a>节所提到的地方）。</p>

With the work of a thinker.* That this signifies from the understanding, is evident from the signification of "a thinker,"* as being the understanding (n. 9598, 9688); and therefore "the work of a thinker"* 
denotes that which is from this. That "a thinker"* denotes the understanding, is because thought belongs to the understanding, just as the affection of love belongs to the will. In the internal 
sense "a thinker"* signified the like as "thought;" for in the internal sense the person is not attended to, but only the thing itself, and a thinker* implies a person (on this subject, see n. 5225, 
5287, 5434, 8343, 8985, 9007). What is meant by being derived from the understanding must be briefly stated. The subject here treated of is the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and in respect to all the truths 
and goods which are therein, this kingdom belongs to the intellectual part; while the truths and goods in the Lord's celestial kingdom belong to the will part. For there are two things to which all 
things in the universe bear relation, namely, good and truth; for which reason there are in man two faculties, the will and the understanding; the will being for the sake of good, and the understanding 
for the sake of truth; for the will receives good, and the understanding truth. [2] The case is similar in the heavens, where there are two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual; the celestial 
kingdom is for the sake of the reception of good, and the spiritual kingdom is for the sake of the reception of truth. And because the universal heaven corresponds to all things that are in man, therefore 
before the Lord heaven is like one man, who accordingly also has two faculties, a will and an understanding; his will being in the celestial kingdom, and his understanding in the spiritual kingdom. 
Now because the spiritual kingdom was represented by the garments of Aaron, and the intellectual part of heaven is in this kingdom, therefore by "the work of a thinker"* is signified the intellectual 
part. (That from its correspondence with each and all things in man, the universal heaven is like one man, and is called the Grand Man, may be seen in the passages already cited in n. 9276e; and 
that with those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom goods and truths have been inscribed on their intellectual part; but with those who are in the celestial kingdom on their will part, may also be 
seen in the passages already cited in n. 9277, 9596.) * skilled craftsman </p>

'With the work of a designer' means a product of the understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'a designer' as the power of understanding, dealt with in <a href="9598.htm">9598</a>, <a href="9688.htm">9688</a>, so that 'the work of a designer' 
means that which is a product of that power. 'A designer' (excogitator) means the power of understanding because thought (cogitatio) belongs to the understanding, even as love and affection belong 
to the will. In the internal sense 'a designer' and 'thought' have the same meaning; for in that sense no attention is paid to the person, only to the actual reality that is meant, and 'designer' carries 
the idea of a person. For the truth of this, see <a href="5225.htm">5225</a>, <a href="5287.htm">5287</a>, <a href="5434.htm">5434</a>, <a href="8343.htm">8343</a>, <a href="8985.htm">8985</a>, <a href="9007.htm">9007</a>. What 'a product of the understanding' means must be stated briefly. The subject at present is the Lord's spiritual 
kingdom, and this kingdom - so far as all truths and forms of good there are concerned - belongs to the understanding part of the mind, whereas things in the Lord's celestial kingdom belong to 
the will part. For there are two entities with which everything in all creation has connection, good and truth; and this is why in the human being there are two mental powers, will and understanding. 
The will exists for the sake of good, and the understanding for the sake of truth; for the will is the recipient of good, and the understanding that of truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation in the heavens is similar. 
There two kingdoms exist, the celestial and the spiritual. The celestial kingdom exists to be a recipient of good and the spiritual kingdom to be a recipient of truth. And since the whole heaven 
corresponds to everything that exists with the human being, and heaven in the Lord's sight is consequently like one complete human being, this as well has the two powers of will and understanding, 
the will residing in the celestial kingdom and the understanding in the spiritual kingdom. Now because the spiritual kingdom was represented by Aaron's garments and heaven's power of understanding resides 
in this kingdom, 'the work of a designer' accordingly means the power of understanding.  </p>
<p>The whole heaven, by virtue of the correspondence with every single thing that exists with the human being, 
is like one complete human being and is called the Grand Man, see the places referred to at the end of <a href="9276.htm">9276</a>. The forms of good and the truths present with those in the Lord's spiritual kingdom have 
been inscribed on the understanding part of their mind, but with those in His celestial kingdom on the will part, see the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>, <a href="9596.htm">9596</a>.  </p>

`Opere excogitatoris': quod significet ex intellectuali, constat ex significatione `excogitatoris' quod sit intellectuale, de qua n. 9598, 9688, opus itaque excogitatoris est quod inde est. Quod `excogitator' 
sit intellectuale, est quia cogitatio {1}est intellectus, sicut affectio quae amoris {2}est voluntatis; `excogitator' in sensu interno simile significat cum cogitatione, nam in sensu interno 
non attenditur ad personam sed ad ipsam rem, et excogitator involvit personam; quod ita sit, videatur n. 5225, 5287, 5434, 8343, 8985, 9007. Quid significat quod ex intellectuali, paucis dicetur: agitur 
ibi de regno spirituali Domini, et id regnum quoad omnia vera et bona quae ibi, (x)pertinet ad partem intellectualem; quae autem in regno caelesti Domini sunt pertinent ad partem voluntariam; sunt 
enim duo ad quae omnia in universo se referunt, bonum et verum; ideo in homine sunt duae facultates, voluntas et intellectus; voluntas est propter bonum, et intellectus propter verum, nam voluntas recipit 
bonum, et intellectus verum. 	Similiter se habet in caelis; ibi duo sunt regna, caeleste et spirituale, 2 regnum caeleste est propter receptionem boni, {3}et regnum spirituale {4} propter receptionem 
veri; et quia universum caelum correspondet omnibus quae apud hominem, et ideo caelum coram Domino est sicut unus homo, cui sic {5}quoque binae facultates {6}sunt, voluntas et intellectus, ejus 
voluntas in regno caelesti, et ejus intellectus in regno spirituali; {7}nunc quia regnum spirituale repraesentatum est per vestes Aharonis {8}, {9}et in [hoc] regno est intellectuale caeli, inde est 
quod per 'opus excogitatoris' significetur intellectuale. Quod universum caelum ex correspondentia cum omnibus et singulis apud hominem sit sicut unus homo, et {10} dicatur Maximus Homo, videatur in 
locis citatis n. 9276 fin.; quod bona et vera apud illos qui in regno spirituali Domini sunt inscripta sint parti eorum intellectuali, at apud illos qui in regno caelesti, parti voluntariae, videatur 
etiam in locis citatis, n. 9277, 9596. @1 ex intellectuali$ @2 , ex voluntario$ @3 at$ @4 i est$ @5 etiam$ @6 quae sunt altered to quae vocantur$ @7 et$ @8 i n. 9814$ @9 ubi$ @10 i ideo$ </p>
