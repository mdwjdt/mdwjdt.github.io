And to Eber were born two sons. The name of one was Peleg (because in his days the land was divided), and the name of his brother was Joktan.<br />Eber was the founder of the second ancient church, and he symbolizes that church. He had two sons, who symbolize two kinds of worship — inward and outward. His two sons were called Peleg and Joktan, and Peleg symbolizes the inward devotions of that church, while Joktan symbolizes its outward devotions. Because in his days the land was divided means that the church was then subverted; the land here as before symbolizes the church. The name of his brother was Joktan symbolizes the outward devotions of that church. </p>

Verse 25. And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. Eber was the first institutor of the second Ancient 
Church, and by him this church is signified; unto him "were born two sons," by whom are signified the two kinds of worship, namely, internal and external. His two sons were called "Peleg" and "Joktan;" 
by "Peleg" is signified the internal worship of that church, and by "Joktan" its external worship; "for in his days was the earth divided," signifies that a new church then arose, "the earth" here 
as before signifying the church; "his brother's name was Joktan" signifies the external worship of that church. </p>

Vers. 25.  Et Ebero nati sunt bini filii, nomen unius Peleg, quia in diebus ejus divisa est terra; et nomen fratris ejus Joktan.  'Eberus' fuit primus institutor Ecclesiae Antiquae alterius per quem 
significatur haec Ecclesia; cui bini filii fuerunt, per quos significantur bini cultus, nempe internus et externus; bini ejus filii dicti fuerunt Peleg et Joktan, per 'Peleg' significatur istius Ecclesiae 
cultus internus, et per 'Joktan' istius Ecclesiae cultus externus:  'quia in diebus ejus divisa est terra' significat quod tunc novum Ecclesiae ortum; 'terra' significat, hic ut prius, Ecclesiam: 
 'nomen fratris ejus Joktan' significat cultum externum istius Ecclesiae. </p>
