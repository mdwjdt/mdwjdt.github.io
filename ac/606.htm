<p><strong>[NCE]606.</strong> Modern scholars{*1} may be familiar with the notion that the Flood, the ark, and consequently the description of both symbolize rebirth and the struggles that lead up to it. So they speak metaphorically of regeneration and struggle as flood waters.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is perhaps referring to a school of biblical interpretation in historical Christianity usually called either allegorical or spiritual exegesis, in which things and persons as well as storylines are interpreted symbolically for a meaning that may or may not correlate closely with the literal text. The New Testament itself is replete with an early form, called typology, of this method of reading the Jewish Scripture (that is, a figure or event in the Jewish Scripture is interpreted as prefiguring some aspect of the Christ event). For example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_606/bible_king-james-version_1-peter_3_20-21" target=_top>1 Peter 3:20-21</a> asserts that Noah and his family being saved in the midst of the waters by the ark refers directly to the Christ who would be coming to save through the waters of baptism (the Flood and ark are the types; baptism and Christ are the antitypes, that is, the things foreshadowed). Augustine, whose work Swedenborg read with care, construed the dimensions of Noah's ark as corresponding to the dimensions of Christ's body (City of God 15:26; see also 15:27). Metaphoric reading of the Jewish Scriptures expanded greatly in the third and fourth centuries through Alexandrian exegetes Origen and Athanasius and continued to develop for another thousand years primarily in the Latin church through some of the greatest Christian authors (Jerome [around 347-around 420], Gregory the Great [540-604], the Venerable Bede [672 or 673-735], Bernard of Clairvaux [1090-1153], and Richard of St. Victor [died 1173]). This tradition finally waned during the Renaissance, when scholarly focus turned with a new fascination to the study of biblical texts in their historical formation, and emphasizing the "plain sense" of Scripture captured the day, though scholars in Swedenborg's century were still aware of the allegorical tradition. The two-volume Medieval Exegesis: The Four Senses of Scripture (Lubac 1998) is the best study of this tradition of interpretation. [JFL] </p>

That the "flood" the "ark" and therefore the things described in connection with them, signify regeneration, and also the temptations that precede regeneration, is in some degree known among the learned 
at this day, who also compare regeneration and temptations to the waters of a flood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 606</b></p><p><b>606.</b>
The Flood, the ark, and therefore descriptions concerning the Flood and the ark, mean regeneration, and also the temptations that precede. This is something learned men of today are aware of, for they 
too compare regeneration and temptations to the waters of a flood.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 606</b>
</p><b>606.</b>
Quod 'diluvium,' 'arca,' et sic quae de diluvio et arca describuntur, significent regenerationem, ut et tentationes quae praecedunt, aliquid hodie apud eruditos notum est, a quibus regeneratio et tentationes 
quoque comparantur aquis diluvii: </p>
