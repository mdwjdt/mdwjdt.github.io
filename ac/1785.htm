<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1785节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1785.</strong>“这些事以后，耶和华的话在异象中临到亚伯兰”表童年的争战过后随之而来的是启示。这从“话”、“耶和华临到亚伯兰的话”，以及“异象”的含义清楚可知。在希伯来语，“话”表真实事物，此处是指已成就的事，也就是前一章所论述的主试探的争战。“耶和华临到亚伯兰的话”无非是指主与自己的对话。然而，在童年和试探的争战期间，当主的人性本质和神性本质尚未合而为一时，这话只能被视为一种启示。内在之物进入外在之物起作用之时，也就是处于外在之物较为遥远的状态和时刻之时，无法以其它方式显明自身。这就是被称为主的谦卑状态的状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1785.</strong> After these words, the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision, means that after the struggles of his youth, he had a revelation. This can be seen from the symbolism of words, of the word of Jehovah to Abram, and of a vision. In Hebrew, words mean things,{*1} and here they mean accomplished events, namely, the Lord's inward struggles treated of in the last chapter.<br />The word of Jehovah to Abram is simply the Lord's word inside himself. In his youth, though, and during his struggles, before his two essential natures had united as one, Jehovah's word necessarily appeared to him as revelation. This is the only way the things inside manifest themselves when they reach the surface, during the phases and moments in which the surface is distant from the core. These phases are referred to as times when the Lord was humbled.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the Hebrew word for "word," see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1785/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1401" target=_top>1401</a>. [Editors]<br />{*2} The Latin word humiliatio, here translated "times when the Lord was humbled," was a term common in Christian theology for the sufferings of Jesus; or even for his simply being born, living in the mortal world, and dying; or for his denying himself the prerogatives of his own divinity while on earth. The term is contrasted with Christ's exaltatio, his being raised up.

After these words, the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision. That this signifies that after the combats in childhood there was revelation, is evident from the signification of "words," also of "the 
word of Jehovah to Abram," and also from the signification of "a vision." By "words," in the Hebrew language, are signified actual things; here the things accomplished, which are the Lord's combats 
of temptations, treated of in the preceding chapter. "The word of Jehovah to Abram" is nothing else than the Lord's word with Himself but in childhood, and in the combats of temptations, when the Essences 
were not yet united as a one, it could not appear otherwise than as a revelation. What is internal, when it acts into what is external, in a state and at moments when this is far away, is presented 
in no other manner. This is the state which is called the Lord's state of humiliation. </p>

That 'after these events' the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision' means that after the conflicts in childhood revelation followed is clear from the meaning of 'words', and also of 'the word of 
Jehovah to Abram', as well as from the meaning of 'a vision'. The expression 'words' in the Hebrew language means real things, in this case the things that have been completed, namely the Lord's conflicts 
brought about by the temptations which were described in the previous chapter. 'The word of Jehovah to Abram' is nothing other than the word which the Lord had within Himself. In childhood however 
and during the conflicts that came with temptations, when [His Human and Divine] Essences were not yet united as one, that word was unable to be seen as anything else than a revelation. That which 
is internal, when acting into that which is external, in a state and at moments when the latter is more remote, cannot manifest itself in any other way. This is the state that is called the Lord's state 
of humiliation. </p>

</p><b>1785.</b>
Quod 'post verba haec factum verbum Jehovae ad Abramum in visione' significet post pugnas in pueritia quod revelatio, constat a significatione 'verborum,' tum 'verbi Jehovae ad Abramum,' ut et a significatione 
'visionis'; per verba in lingua Hebraea significantur res, hic res peractae quae sunt pugnae tentationum Domini, de quibus in capite praecedente; 'verbum Jehovae ad Abramum' non aliud est 
quam Domini verbum secum; at in pueritia, inque pugnis tentationum cum essentiae nondum unitae ut unum, non aliter apparere potuit ac revelatio; quod internum est, quando agit in externum, in statu et 
momentis, cum hoc remotius, non aliter sistitur; hic status est qui appellatur status humiliationis Domini. </p>
