<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10200</strong>.“每早晨”表每当清晰的爱之状态存在之时。这从“早晨”的含义清楚可知，“早晨”是指当清晰的爱之状态存在之时（参看<a href="10134.htm">10134</a>节），因此，“每早晨”是指每当这种状态存在之时。前面已数次说明，天上爱和光的状态，也就是良善和真理的状态连续不断地依次接踵而来，就像地上的早晨、正午、晚上和黎明，以及春、夏、秋、冬一样。还说明，一天四个时间段和一年四季都来源于这些状态；因为在世界上产生的事物是存在于天堂中的真实事物的形像。这是因为一切属世之物都是从属灵之物，也就是天堂里的神性产生的。由此明显可知，天堂里的状态变化是何性质，因为通过对比世上热和光的状态就能知道它们，天堂里的热是来自主的爱之良善，那里的光是来自主的信之真理。那里的状态以这种方式接踵而来，是为了让天使能不断变得更完美；因为他们以这种方式经历良善和真理的一切变化，并充满它们。此外，那里的爱之良善和信之真理的变化的不同，就像地上所有特定地区或气候带的热和光的不同；也就是说，离赤道近的热和光，不同于离赤道远的，而且这一天的不同于下一天的，以及这一年的不同于下一年的。绝对相似或一模一样的东西从来不会返回，因为主规定，无论在灵界，还是在自然界，都没有绝对一模一样的东西；完美由此不断增长。</p>

Morning by morning. That this signifies when the state of love is in clearness, is evident from the signification of "morning," as being when the state of love is in clearness (see n. 10134); hence "morning 
by morning" denotes when there is this state. That in the heavens there is continually a succession of states of love and light, that is, of good and truth, as on earth there are morning, noon, 
evening, and twilight; and spring, summer, autumn, and winter, has been occasionally shown above; also that these times of the day and of the year have their origin from this source; for the things 
which come forth in the world are images of those which come forth in the heavens, because everything natural comes forth from what is spiritual, that is, from the Divine in the heavens. From this it 
is evident what is the nature of the variations of states in the heavens, for they are known from comparison with the states of heat and light in the world; for heat in the heavens is the good of love 
from the Lord, and light there is the truth of faith from the Lord. The reason for such successions of states there is that the angels there may be continually being perfected; for in this way they pass 
through all the varieties of good and of truth, and become imbued with them. The differences of the varieties of the good of love and of the truth of faith in the heavens are also like the differences 
of heat and of light in the several regions or climates of the earth, namely, of one kind nearer to the equator, and of another at a greater distance on each side therefrom; and differently in each 
day of every year, and also in one year differently from another; for there is never a return of what is absolutely alike, or the same; it being provided that what is absolutely the same is never found 
either in the spiritual world or in the natural. From this the perfection continually increases. </p>

'Morning by morning' means whenever a state of love in clearness exists. This is clear from the meaning of 'morning' as a time when a state of love in clearness exists, dealt with in <a href="10134.htm">10134</a>, so that 'morning 
by morning' or every single morning means whenever that state exists. It has been shown several times before that in heaven states of love and light, that is, of goodness and truth, follow one 
another in sequence unceasingly, just as on earth morning, midday, evening, and twilight do, and as spring, summer, autumn, and winter do. It has also been shown that those states are the origin from 
which these times of day and seasons of the year arise; for things that come into being in the world are images of the realities that exist in heaven. This is so because everything natural comes into 
being from what is spiritual, that is, from what is Divine in the heavens. From this it is evident what the variations of the states in heaven are like, for one comes to know what they are by comparison 
with the states of heat and light that exist in the world, heat in the heavens being the good of love coming from the Lord and the light there being the truth of faith coming from the Lord. States 
there follow one another in this kind of way to the end that angels may constantly grow more perfect; for as they pass through those states they experience all varieties of goodness and truth and are 
endowed with them. The differences furthermore in the varieties of the good of love and truth of faith there are like the differences of heat and light in all the particular regions or climates of the 
planet; that is to say, those near the equator are different from those further away in either direction from it, and they are different from one day to the next, and from one year to the next. What 
is exactly similar or the same does not ever return; for it has been provided that nothing shall ever be exactly the same, neither in the spiritual world nor in the natural world; and this enables perfection 
to increase constantly.  </p>

`In mane {1}in mane': quod significet cum status amoris in claro est, constat ex significatione `mane' quod sit cum status amoris in claro est, de qua n. 10,134; inde `in mane {2}in mane' seu singulis 
matutinis, est cum ille status. Quod in caelis succedant status amoris et lucis, hoc est, boni et veri, continue, (x)sicut in terris mane, meridies, vespera, et diluculum, (c)et sicut ver, aestas, 
autumnus, et hiems, prius aliquoties ostensum est; tum quod inde tempora illa diei et anni originem ducant, nam quae in mundo existunt sunt imagines rerum quae in caelis, ex causa quia omne naturale existit 
a spirituali, hoc est, a Divino in caelis; inde patet quales sunt variationes statuum in caelis, nam noscuntur ex comparatione {3}cum statibus caloris et lucis in mundo; calor enim in caelis est 
bonum amoris a Domino, et lux ibi est verum fidei a Domino. Quod tales ibi successiones statuum sint, est causa ut angeli ibi continue perficiantur, sic enim pertranseunt omnes varietates boni et veri 
{4}, ac imbuunt illa; differentiae varietatum boni amoris et veri fidei ibi etiam se habent sicut differentiae caloris et lucis in singulis regionibus seu climatibus telluris, nempe aliter propius 
ad aequatorem, et aliter remotius ab illo utrinque; ac aliter unoquovis die cujusvis anni, et quoque aliter unoquovis anno; nam prorsus simile seu idem nusquam redit; provisum enim est ut non detur prorsus 
idem, tam in mundo spirituali quam in mundo naturali; inde perfectio continue crescit. @1 d et i in cp n. 10,176$ @2 et$ @3 statuum$ @4 i ibi$ </p>
