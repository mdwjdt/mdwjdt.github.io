<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6756节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6756.</strong>“他出去到他弟兄那里”表与教会真理的结合。这从“弟兄”和“出去到他们那里”的含义清楚可知：“弟兄”是指教会的真理，如下文所述；“出去到他们那里”是指与他们结合。关于“弟兄”，他们有时表示良善，有时表示教会的真理。当论述属天教会时，他们表示良善；当论述属灵教会时，他们表示真理，因为属天教会处于良善，而属灵教会处于真理。在古时，凡属教会的人都互称“弟兄”。那些属于属灵教会的人也基于良善互称“弟兄”（参看<a href="3803.htm">3803</a>节）；然而，内在教会成员如此称呼却有所不同；这些不同取决于良善的性质，因而取决于真理，因为良善从真理获得自己的具体性质。后来，当教会背离良善，从而也背离真理时，人们互称“弟兄”不再是由于属灵的血缘和亲缘关系，也就是仁与信的关系，唯独由于属世的血缘和亲缘关系，以及友情。此外，他们开始觉得称呼一个地位在自己之下的人为“弟兄”有失身份。原因在于，他们极不重视，或根本不重视出自属灵源头的亲密关系，却极为，甚至高度重视有属世和社会源头的亲密关系。教会真理之所以被称为“弟兄”，是因为雅各的儿子们代表整体上的教会真理（<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）。<br />在古时，人们之所以由于属灵的亲密关系而被称为“弟兄”，是因为新生或重生会在一个比属世的出生更高的层面上建立起家庭血缘和亲缘关系。另一个原因是，这些血缘和亲缘关系的起源能追溯到同一个父亲，就是主。正因如此，死后进入天堂的人若非出于良善和真理，就不再承认任何弟兄，甚至不再承认他们的母亲或父亲。新的弟兄关系照着这些良善和真理而在那里得以形成。这就是为何在以前的时代，那些属于教会的人互称“弟兄”。<br />以色列将雅各的所有后裔都称作“弟兄”，其他人则称作“同伴”，这一事实从以下文明显看出来：<br />我必激动埃及攻击埃及，人攻击自己的弟兄，人攻击自己的同伴。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.2.htm">19:2</a>）<br /><br />人帮助自己的同伴，他对自己的弟兄说，要坚强！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.6.htm">41:6</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />你们各人当谨防自己的同伴，不可信靠弟兄；因为弟兄尽行欺骗，同伴都谗谤人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.4.htm">9:4</a>）<br />雅各的所有后裔都自称“弟兄”，这一事实可见于以赛亚书：<br />他们必将你们的弟兄从列族中送出，或骑马，或坐马车，坐轿，作为供物献给耶和华。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.20.htm">66:20</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />你总要立耶和华你神所拣选的人为王管理他们；你要从你弟兄中间立一个王管理他们；不可立不是你弟兄的人，一个外人管理他们。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.15.htm">17:15</a>）<br />他们甚至称以扫的子孙为“弟兄”，因为他们是雅各的后裔，如摩西五经：<br />我们离了住西珥的我们弟兄以扫的子孙。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.8.htm">2:8</a>）<br />在古时，那些属教会的人都互称“弟兄”的原因如前所述，即因为他们承认主为他们独一的父，并且他们从祂接受一个新的灵魂和新的生命。因此，主说：<br />你们不要受拉比的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的夫子，就是基督。你们都是弟兄。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.8.htm">23:8</a>）<br />由于属灵的弟兄关系源于爱，也就是说，一个人属于另一个人，那些处于良善的人“在主里面，主也在他们里面”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>），所以主称他们为弟兄：<br />耶稣就伸手指着门徒说，看哪，我的母亲，我的弟兄。凡遵行我天父旨意的人，就是我的弟兄、姐妹和母亲了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.49.htm">12:49</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.50.htm">50</a>）<br /><br />这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">25:40</a>）<br />祂还称门徒为“弟兄”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.10.htm">28:10</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.17.htm">20:17</a>）。“门徒”在代表意义上表示所有处于信之真理和仁之良善的人。</p>

And he went out unto his brethren. That this signifies conjunction with the truths of the church, is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being the truths of the church (of which in what 
follows) and from the signification of "going out unto them," as being to be conjoined with them. As regards "brethren," they sometimes signify the goods, and sometimes the truths of the church; when 
the celestial church is treated of, they signify goods, and when the spiritual church is treated of, they signify truths, because the celestial church is in good, but the spiritual church in truth. And 
in ancient times all who were of the church called themselves "brethren." They too who were of the spiritual church called themselves "brethren," from good (see n. 3803); but the men of the internal 
church did this with a difference according to the quality of the good, thus according to truths, for good has its quality from truths. Afterward, when the church turned aside from good, and hence also 
from truth, they then no longer called one another "brethren" from spiritual consanguinity and affinity, which are of charity and of faith, but only from natural consanguinity and affinity, and also 
from friendship. Moreover, they began to be indignant that one of meaner condition should call himself a "brother." The reason was that they made little or nothing of relationship from a spiritual origin, 
but very much, and indeed everything, of relationships from a natural and civil origin. (That the truths of the church are called "brethren," is evident from the fact that the sons of Jacob represented 
the truths of the church in the complex, see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512.) [2] The reason why in ancient times they were called "brethren" from spiritual affinity, was that the new birth, 
or regeneration, made consanguinities and affinities in a higher degree than natural birth; and because the former derive their origin from one father, that is, from the Lord. Hence it is that men after 
death, who come into heaven, no longer acknowledge any brother, nor even a mother or father, except from good and truth, in accordance with which they find there new brotherhoods. From this then 
it is that they who were of the church called one another "brethren." [3] That the sons of Israel called all those "brethren" who were from Jacob, but others "companions," is plain from these passages: </p>
<p> 
    I will commingle Egypt with Egypt, that a man shall fight against his brother, and a man against his companion (Isa. 19:2).      A man helpeth his companion, and he saith to his brother, Be 
courageous (Isa. 41:6).      Beware ye a man of his companion, and confide ye not upon any brother; for every brother supplanting will supplant, and every companion will slander (Jer. 9:4). [4] That 
all who were from Jacob called themselves "brethren:"- </p>
<p>     Then shall they bring all your brethren out of all nations, an offering to Jehovah, upon horses, upon chariot, and upon litters (Isa. 66:20).  
    Thou shalt surely set over them a king, whom Jehovah thy God shall choose; from the midst of thy brethren thou shalt set a king over them; thou mayest not put over them a man a foreigner, who 
is not their brother (Deut. 17:15). They also called the sons of Esau "brethren," because they were from Jacob, as in Moses: </p>
<p>     We passed over with our brethren the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir 
(Deut. 2:8). [5] That in ancient times they who were of the church called themselves "brethren," was as before said because they acknowledged the Lord as the one only Father, and because from Him 
they had a new soul and new life. Therefore the Lord says: </p>
<p>     Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren (Matt. 23:8). As spiritual brotherhood is from love, 
namely, that one may be another's, and they who are in good are "in the Lord, and the Lord in them" (John 14:20), therefore they are called "brethren" by the Lord: </p>
<p>     Jesus stretching forth His 
hand toward His disciples said, Behold My mother and My brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the heavens, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother (Matt. 12:49-50).  
    Insofar as ye have done it to one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it to Me (Matt. 25:40); </p>
<p>and He also calls the disciples "brethren" (Matt. 28:10; John 20:17). By "disciples" in 
the representative sense are meant all who are in the truths of faith and the good of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6756</b></p><p><b>6756.</b>
'That he went out to his brothers' means a joining to the Church's truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'brothers' as the truths of the Church, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'going out 
to them' as being joined to them. As regards 'brothers', sometimes the expression means the forms of good, at other times the truths of the Church. Forms of good are meant when the celestial Church 
is the subject, truths when the spiritual Church is the subject. The reason for this is that the celestial Church is governed by good, but the spiritual Church by truth; and in ancient times all who 
belonged to the Church called one another brothers. Those who belonged to the spiritual Church did indeed call one another brothers on the basis of good, <a href="3803.htm">3803</a>; yet there were differences in the ways that 
members of the internal Church did so. Those differences depended on the nature of the good, and so on truths since good derives its specific nature from truths. Later on when the Church fell away 
from good, and consequently from truth also, people ceased any more to call one another brothers as a result of spiritual connections and relationships, which are those of charity and faith, but solely 
as a result of natural connections and relationships, or else as a result of friendship. They also began to consider it beneath them to call someone brother who ranked less highly than themselves. 
The reason for this was that they attached little or no importance to close ties that sprang from a spiritual origin, but great and supreme importance to close ties that had a natural or social origin. 
The Church's truths are clearly called 'brothers', because the sons of Jacob represented the truths of the Church in their entirety, <a href="5407.htm">5407</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why in ancient times 
people were called 'brothers' as a result of spiritual relationships is that the new birth or regeneration established family connections and relationships on a level superior to that of those established 
by natural birth. A further reason is that those connections and relationships trace their origin back to the same Father, who is the Lord. This goes to explain why people who enter heaven after 
death no longer acknowledge any brother, or even their mother or father, if the relationship is not founded on goodness and truth. It is in accordance with these that new brotherly relationships are 
formed there. This then is why those who belonged to the Church in former times called one another brothers. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the children of Israel referred to all who were descended from Jacob 
as brothers, but everyone else as companions, is evident from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will embroil Egypt with Egypt, in order that a man may fight against brother, and a man against his 
companion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
 A man helps his companion and says to his brother, Be firm. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Take heed, a man of his companion, and put no trust in any 
brother, for every brother supplants wholly, and every companion utters slanders. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%209:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 9:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that all who were descended from Jacob called themselves brothers may be seen in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Then 
they will bring all your brothers from all nations as an offering to Jehovah, on horses, in chariots, and in covered waggons. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall indeed set a king over you<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> whom 
Jehovah your God will choose, from among your brothers shall you set a king over you;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> you may not place over you<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> a foreigner, who is not your<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> brother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2017:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 17:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Even the children of Esau, 
because they were descended from Jacob, were called brothers by them, in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
We passed through, away from our brothers the children of Esau dwelling in Seir. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The reason why in 
ancient times those who belonged to the Church called one another brothers was, as stated above, that they acknowledged the Lord as their one and only Father and received a new soul and life from Him, 
on account of which the Lord says, </p>
<blockquote>
Refuse to be called Rabbi, for one is your Master, Christ; but all you are brothers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2023:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 23:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Since spiritual brotherhood has its origin in love, that is, 
one person is another's, and those who are governed by good abide in the Lord, and He abides in them, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:20</a>, the Lord calls them brothers, in Matthew, </p>
<p>Jesus stretching out His hand over His disciples 
said, Behold My mother and My brothers; for whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven is My brother, and sister, and mother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:49,%2050&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:49, 50</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Insofar as you 
did it to one of the least of My brothers you did it to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
He again calls the disciples brothers in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
'Disciples' is used in the representative sense to mean 
all who are guided by the truths of faith and governed by the good of charity.

`Et exivit ad fratres suos': quod significet conjunctionem cum veris Ecclesiae, constat a significatione `fratrum' quod sint vera Ecclesiae, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `exire ad illos' quod 
sit conjungi illis.  Quod `fratres' attinet, significant illi nunc bona, nunc vera Ecclesiae; ubi agitur de Ecclesia caelesti, significant bona, {1}et cum agitur de Ecclesia spirituali, significant 
vera; causa est quia Ecclesia caelestis est in bono, at Ecclesia spiritualis in vero; et antiquis temporibus omnes qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt vocabant se fratres; qui ab Ecclesia spirituali fuerunt se quidem 
vocabant fratres ex bono, n. 3803, sed internae Ecclesiae homines hoc faciebant cum differentia secundum quale boni, ita secundum vera, nam bonum suum quale habet a veris; postea cum {2}Ecclesia 
deflexit a bono et inde quoque a vero, tunc non amplius ex consanguinitate et affinitate spirituali, quae sunt charitatis et fidei, se mutuo appellabant fratres, sed solum ex consanguinitate et affinitate 
naturali, {3}ut et ex amicitia; et quoque indigne ferre coeperunt viliorem se fratrem vocare; causa erat quia parum vel nihili faciebant proximitates ex origine spirituali, {4}ac plurimum et prae 
omni proximitates ex origine naturali et civili.  Quod vera Ecclesiae dicantur fratres, {5}constat ex eo quod filii Jacobi repraesentarent' vera Ecclesiae in complexu, {6}n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 
5512. 	2 Quod antiquis temporibus fratres dicti fuerint ex affinitate spirituali, {7}est quia nova nativitas seu regeneratio faciebat consanguinitates et {8} affinitates in superiore gradu quam nativitas 
naturalis; et quia {9} illa ab uno Patre ducunt originem, nempe a Domino; inde est quod homines post mortem qui in caelum veniunt non agnoscant amplius aliquem fratrem, ne quidem matrem et patrem, 
nisi ex bono et vero; secundum haec novas ibi fraternitates {10}nanciscuntur'; inde nunc est quod qui {11} ab Ecclesia fuerunt se mutuo vocaverint fratres. 	3 Quod {12} filii Israelis omnes illos fratres 
dixerint qui ex Jacobo fuerunt, reliquos autem socios, patet ab his locis: apud Esaiam, Commiscebo Aegyptum cum Aegypto, ut pugnet vir contra fratrem, et vir contra socium suum, xix 2: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Vir 
socium suum {13}adjuvat, et fratri suo dicit, Confirma te, xli 6: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Vir a socio suo cavete vobis, et super ullo fratre ne confidite; omnis namque (x)frater supplantando supplantat, 
et omnis socius calumniatur, ix 3 [A.V. 4]:{14} 4 quod omnes qui ex Jacobo se vocaverint fratres, apud Esaiam, Tunc adducent omnes fratres vestros ex omnibus gentibus, (x)munus Jehovae, super 
equis, super curru, et super raedis cameratis, lxvi 20: </p>
<p>apud Mosen, Ponendo pones super {15}eos regem, quem elegerit Jehovah Deus tuus, e medio fratrum tuorum pones super {15}eos regem; non poteris 
dare super {15}eos virum alienigenam, qui non frater {15}eorum sit, Deut. xvii 15. Etiam filios Esavi, quia ex Jacobo fuerunt, {16}dixerunt fratres, apud Mosen, Transivimus cum fratribus nostris filiis 
Esavi habitantibus in Seir {17}, Deut. ii 8. 	5 Quod {18}antiquis temporibus se fratres appellaverint qui {19}erant ab Ecclesia, erat, ut supra dictum, quia Dominum pro unico Patre agnoverunt, 
et quia ab Ipso eis nova anima et nova vita; idcirco Dominus dicit, {20}Nolite vocari Rabbi, unus {21} est vester Magister, Christus, omnes autem vos fratres estis, Matth. xxiii 8. (m)Quia fraternitas 
spiritualis est ex amore, quod nempe unus sit alterius, et qui in bono sunt `in Domino sunt, et Dominus in illis,' Joh. xiv 20, idcirco fratres {22}vocantur a Domino,(n) apud Matthaeum, Jesus extendens 
manum Suam super discipulos Suos dixit, Ecce mater Mea, et fratres Mei; quisquis enim fecerit voluntatem Patris Mei, Qui est in caelis, ille Meus frater, et soror, et mater est, xii 49 [,50]: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, In quantum fecistis uni ex fratribus Meis minimis Mihi fecistis, xxv 40: </p>
