<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>935.</strong>“夏与冬”表重生之人在属其新意愿之物方面的状态，该状态的交替如同夏与冬。这一点从有关冷与热的论述清楚可知。尚未重生之人的交替好比冷与热，而已重生之人的交替好比夏与冬。冷与热论及要重生之人，而夏与冬论及已重生之人。这一点通过以下分析明显可知：论及要重生之人，先提冷，后提热；而论及已重生之人，先提夏，后提冬。这是因为，正在重生之人从冷，即从无信与仁开始；但重生之后，他从仁开始。<br />重生之人会经历交替，时而没有仁爱，时而有些仁爱。这一点是显而易见的，因为每个人，即便是重生之人，只有邪恶，一切良善之物唯独是主的。由于只有邪恶，故他必然经历交替，可以说时而活在夏天，即有仁爱，时而活在冬天，即没有仁爱。<br />存在这类交替是为了使人越来越完善，从而变得越来越快乐。重生之人不仅在肉身生活期间经历交替，而且进入来生后还会经历交替。因为若其意愿之物没有如夏与冬那样的交替，其觉知之物没有如昼与夜那样的交替，他决无可能得以完善，并变得更快乐。不过，在来生，这些交替就象温带地区的夏与冬的交替，和春天昼与夜的交替。<br />先知书也将这些状态描述为夏与冬、昼与夜，如撒迦利亚书：<br />那日，必有活水从耶路撒冷出来，一半往东海流，一半往西海流；冬夏都是如此。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.8.htm">14:8</a>）<br />这论及新耶路撒冷，或主在天上和地上的国，即祂的国在这两个地方的状态，被称为“冬、夏”。诗篇：<br />神啊，白昼属你，黑夜也属你。亮光和日头是你所预备的，地的一切疆界是你所立的，夏天和冬天是你所定的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗74.16.htm">74:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗74.17.htm">17</a>）<br />这些话象征类似事物。同样，在耶利米书：<br />白日黑夜的约必不废弃，白日黑夜要按时轮转（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.20.htm">33:20</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]935.</strong> The things already said about cold and heat establish the symbolism of and summer and winter as the condition of an already-regenerate person in respect to new movements of the will, which alternate the way summer and winter do. The two extremes for people undergoing the process of regeneration are like cold and heat, but for people who have regenerated they are like summer and winter.<br />The clue to the fact that the previous phrase describes a regenerating person and the present phrase a regenerate one is that the previous phrase mentions cold first and heat second, while the present phrase mentions summer first and winter second. People who are regenerating start with cold, that is, with no faith or charity, but when they have been reborn they start with charity.<br />[2] Regenerate people go back and forth between having no charity at one time and some charity at another. This is clear to see because everyone, even a person reborn, has nothing but evil inside; all goodness is the Lord's alone. Since the regenerate have nothing but evil inside, they cannot help seesawing, living now in a kind of summer (in charity) and now in winter (no charity). These cycles exist to bring them into increasing perfection and so into increasing happiness.<br />Regenerate people go through these cycles not only while they are living in the body but also when they come into the other life. Without alternations that resemble those of summer and winter in matters of the will, and day and night in matters of the intellect, the regenerate would never be perfected or made happier. Their ups and downs in the other world, though, are like the summertime and wintertime changes that occur in temperate zones, and like the daytime and nighttime changes that occur in the spring.<br />[3] The prophets too portray these phases in terms of summer and winter, day and night, as in Zechariah:<br />And it will happen on that day that living water will go out from Jerusalem, part of it to the eastern sea and part of it to the western sea;{*1} in summer and in winter it will happen. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_935/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_14_8" target=_top>Zechariah 14:8</a>)<br />This concerns a new Jerusalem, or the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, and conditions in each, which are described as summer and winter. In David:<br />God, yours is the day, yours also the night. You prepared the light and the sun. You set up all the boundaries of the earth. You formed summer and winter. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_935/bible_king-james-version_psalms_74_16-17" target=_top>Psalms 74:16-17</a>)<br />These things involve similar meanings. Likewise in Jeremiah the fact that neither the compact with the day nor the compact with the night was to be nullified, so that daytime and night would occur at their times (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_935/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_33_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 33:20</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The "eastern" sea here, from the perspective of Jerusalem, refers to the Dead Sea, and the "western" sea refers to the Mediterranean.

That "summer and winter" signify the state of the regenerate man as to his new will, the alternations of which are as summer and winter, is evident from what has been said about cold and heat. The alternations 
with those who are to be regenerated are likened to cold and heat, but the alternations with those who have been regenerated are likened to summer and winter. That in the former case the man 
who is to be regenerated is treated of, and in the present case the man who has been regenerated, is evident from this, that in the one case cold is named first, and heat second; whereas in the other 
case summer is first named, and winter second. The reason is that a man who is being regenerated begins from cold, that is, from no faith and charity; but when he has been regenerated, he begins from 
charity.  [2] That there are alternations with the regenerate man-now no charity, and now some charity-is clearly evident for the reason that in everyone, even when regenerated, there is nothing but 
evil, and everything good is the Lord's alone. And since there is nothing but evil in him, he cannot but undergo alternations and now be as it were in summer, that is, in charity, and now in winter, 
that is, in no charity. Such alternations exist in order that man may be perfected more and more, and thus be rendered more and more happy, and they take place with the regenerate man not only while 
he lives in the body, but also when he comes into the other life, for without alternations as of summer and winter as to what is of his will, and as of day and night as to what is of his understanding, 
he cannot possibly be perfected and rendered more happy; but in the other life these alternations are like those of summer and winter in the temperate zones, and those of day and night in springtime. 
 [3] These states are also described in the Prophets by "summer and winter" and by "day and night;" as in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go out from 
Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter shall it be (Zech. 14:8),where the New Jerusalem is treated of, or the kingdom of the 
Lord in heaven and on earth, that is, its state of both kinds, which is called "summer and winter." In David: </p>
<p>     The day is Thine, the night also is Thine; Thou hast prepared the light and the sun, 
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth, Thou hast made summer and winter (Ps. 74:16-17), where like things are involved. So in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     That the covenant of the day, and the covenant of the 
night be not made vain, that there may be day and night in their season (Jer. 33:20). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 935</b></p><p><b>935.</b>
'And summer and winter' means the state of a regenerate person as regards things belonging to his new will, which by turns come and go as summer and winter do. This becomes clear from what has been stated 
about cold and heat. The changes taking place in people who have yet to be regenerated are likened to cold and heat, while those that take place in those who have been regenerated are likened to 
summer and winter. That the person who has yet to be regenerated is the subject of the former phrase while one who has been regenerated is the subject of this latter is clear from the consideration that 
with the former 'cold' is mentioned first and 'heat' second, while here 'summer' comes first and 'winter' second. The reason is that the person who is being regenerated starts from 'cold', that is, 
from the point of no faith and charity; but once he has been regenerated he starts from the point of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that a regenerate person experiences alternations, that is to say, at one 
point no charity resides with him and at the next some charity, is perfectly clear for the reason that with everybody, even the regenerate, nothing but evil exists. Everything good with him is the Lord's 
alone. Because nothing but evil exists with him it is inevitable that he undergoes such changes, at one time living so to speak in 'summer', that is, in charity, and at another in 'winter', that 
is, in no charity. The result of such changes is that a person is being ever more perfected and so made ever more happy. Such changes take place with a regenerate person not only during his lifetime 
but also when he has entered the next life, for without changes like those of summer and winter as regards things of the will, and like those of day and night as regards things of the understanding, he 
is in no way perfected and made more happy. In the next life however people's changes are like those of summer and winter in temperate regions and like those of day and night in springtime. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The 
Prophets too describe these states as summer and winter, and as day and night, as in Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
And it will be, on that day living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, part of them to the eastern 
sea and part of them to the western sea; in summer and in winter will it be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2014:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 14:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the New Jerusalem, or the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, that is, the state of His 
kingdom in both places, which is also called summer and winter. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
O God, Your is the day, Thine also is the night. You have prepared the light and the sun, You have fixed all the bounds of 
the earth, You have made summer and winter. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2074:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 74:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These words embody like matters. Similarly in Jeremiah who says that the covenant for the day is not to be broken, nor the covenant for the 
night, so that day and night come at their appointed time, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2033:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 33:20</a>. 
</blockquote>

</p><b>935.</b>
'Et aestas et hiems': quod significent statum hominis regenerati quoad nova ejus voluntaria quorum vices se habent sicut aestas et hiems, constare potest ab illis quae de frigore et aestu dicta sunt; 
vices regenerandorum assimilantur frigori et aestui, sed vices regeneratorum aestati et hiemi: quod de regenerando ibi actum, hic autem de regenerato, constat inde quod ibi primo loco 'frigus' nominetur 
et secundo 'aestus'; hic autem primo loco 'aestas' et secundo 'hiems'; causa est quia homo qui regeneratur, incipit a frigore, hoc est, a nulla fide et charitate, at cum regeneratus est, tunc incipit 
a charitate.  [2] Quod vices regenerato sint, nempe quod apud eum nunc nulla charitas et nunc aliqua charitas, constare manifeste potest ex causa quod apud unumquemvis, etiam regeneratum, non sit 
nisi malum, et quod omne bonum sit solius Domini: quia apud eum nihil nisi malum, non potest aliter quam vices subire, et nunc esse quas in 'aestate,' hoc est, in charitate, nunc autem in 'hieme,' hoc 
est, in nulla charitate: vices tales sunt ut homo magis et magis perficiatur et sic ut magis et magis felix reddatur.  Vices tales non solum sunt apud hominem regeneratum dum vixit in corpore, sed etiam 
cum in alteram vitam venit, nam absque viribus quasi aestatis et hiemis quoad voluntaria et quasi diei et noctis quoad intellectualia, nusquam perficitur et felicior redditur; sed vices eorum in altera 
vita se habent sicut vices aestatis et hiemis in zonis temperatis et sicut vices diei et noctis temporibus vernis.  [3] Status hi etiam apud Prophetas describuntur per aestatem et hiemem et per 
diem et noctem, ut apud Zachariam, 	Et erit, in die illo exibunt aquae vivae de Hierosolyma pars illarum ad mare orientale, et pars illarum ad mare posterius in aestate et in hieme erit, xiv 8; </p>
<p>ubi 
de Nova Hierosolyma, seu de regno Domini in caelo et in terra, seu de statu utrobique, qui etiam vocatur aestas et hiems: apud Davidem, 	Deus, Tibi dies, etiam Tibi nox; Tu praeparasti lucem e solem; 
Tu statuisti omnes terminos terrae; aestatem et hiemem Tu formasti, Ps. lxxiv 16, 17; </p>
<p>quae similia involvunt: similiter apud Jeremiam, 	Quod non irritum reddetur foedus diei, et foedus noctis, ut sit 
dies et nox in tempore suo, xxxiii 20. </p>
