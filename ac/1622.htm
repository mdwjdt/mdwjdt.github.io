<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1622节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1622.</strong>关于天堂花园。它们都美到令人窒息。这些天堂花园能显为可见，一望无际，里面有各样树木，并且如此美丽宜人，超乎想象。它们如此生动地呈现在灵人或天使眼前，以致他们不仅能看到这些景象，甚至能感知细节，远比肉眼在世上所看到的这类事物生动得多。为免我对此有所怀疑，我也被带到那里。它就在前面稍向上一点，靠近右眼角。这就是那些过着天堂生活之人所在的地方，我在那里看到了他们。那里的每一个事物似乎都处在春天开花季的最美时节，其绚丽和多样性令人震惊。每一个事物都活生生的，因为它具有代表性，那里的所有事物无不是代表物，无不具有某种属天或属灵的含义。它们以这种方式不仅愉悦眼睛，还使心灵充满幸福。<br />某些灵魂，就是从尘世来的新人，出于在世时所接受的信念，质疑来世存在这类事物的可能性，认为没有木头和石头。于是他们被带到那里，并由此与我对话，声称他们惊讶得说不出话来，他们永远想不出有什么方式来表现它何等无法形容，以及每一个事物所散发出来的喜悦和快乐，并且这一切变化无穷。被引入天堂的灵魂绝大部分首先被带到天堂花园。然而，天使看待这些花园的眼光却迥然不同。取悦他们的不是花园，而是它们所代表之物，就是产生它们的属天、属灵之物。上古教会正是通过这些代表物而与天堂相联。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1622.</strong> To turn now to the magnificent gardens: they are breathtaking. Huge parks containing every kind of tree come into view, so beautiful and so charming that they defy all power of imagination. They are presented to the inhabitants' outward sight in such a living way that not only are they seen, they are also perceived in all their detail much more vividly than anything our physical eyesight discerns on earth.<br />To remove any doubts I might have on the subject, I was taken there (the place is in front, at an angle slightly above the right eye, where people who live the life of paradise are located), and I saw. Absolutely everything appears in its loveliest springtime and its loveliest bloom, with stunning magnificence and variety. Every single object is alive with representation, since nothing exists there that does not represent or symbolize something heavenly or spiritual. So the sights not only please the eyes but also cheer the mind.<br />[2] Some souls newly arrived from the world once expressed doubt 钬?because of principles they had adopted while still alive 钬?that similar things could exist in the other world, where there is neither wood nor stone.{*1} They were taken up to that place and spoke to me from there. Stupefied, they said that it was indescribable, and that they could never find a mental picture to represent its indescribability. Exhilaration and happiness shone out from every particle, they said, with unending variety.<br />For the most part, souls being introduced to heaven are taken first of all to the paradisal gardens. Angels look at such things with very different eyes, however. It is not the actual gardens that delight an angel but the things they represent, and so the heavenly and spiritual realities behind them.<br />The earliest church had its paradisal gardens from this source.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This reference to "wood" and "stone" presumably includes all physical matter. Aristotle used 峤曃晃?(h煤le), a Greek word for wood, broadly as a term for matter. Somewhat similarly, in the Judeo-Christian tradition the phrase "wood and stone" has been used broadly to express that which is lifeless; see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1622/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_4_28" target=_top>Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1622/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_19_18" target=_top>2 Kings 19:18</a>; Kolb and Wengert 2000, 548.20.

As regards the paradisal scenes, they are amazing. Paradisal gardens are presented to view of immense extent, consisting of trees of every kind, and of beauty and pleasantness so great as to surpass 
every idea of thought; and these gardens are presented with such life before the external sight that those who are there not only see them, but perceive every particular much more vividly than the sight 
of the eye perceives such things on earth. That I might not be in doubt respecting this, I was brought to the region where those are who live a paradisal life, and I saw it; it is in front of and a 
little above the corner of the right eye. Each and all things there appear in their most beautiful springtime and flower, with a magnificence and variety that are amazing; and they are living, each and 
all, because they are representatives; for there is nothing that does not represent and signify something celestial and spiritual. Thus they not only affect the sight with pleasantness, but also the 
mind with happiness.  [2] Certain souls, newcomers from the world-who from principles received while they lived, doubted the possibility of such things existing in the other life, where there is no 
wood and stone-being taken up thither and speaking thence with me, said in their amazement that it was beyond words, and that they could in no way represent the unutterableness of what they saw by any 
idea, and that joys and delights shone forth from every single thing, and this with successive varieties. The souls that are being introduced into heaven are for the most part carried first of all to 
the paradisal regions. But the angels look upon these things with different eyes; the paradises do not delight them, but the representatives; thus the celestial and spiritual things from which these 
come. It was from these representatives that the Most Ancient Church had what related to paradise.  </p>

As regards the paradise gardens, these are breath-taking. Such gardens are to be seen, of vast extent, consisting of trees of every kind, and so beautiful and lovely as to surpass everything imaginable. 
These are presented so vividly before the eyes of spirits or angels that they not merely see them but even perceive the details far more vividly than the sight of the eye can take such things in on 
earth. To prevent my having any doubt about it, I too have been taken there. It is in front and a little higher- near the corner of the right eye. This is where those are who live the life of paradise; 
and there I saw them. Every single thing growing there appears at its loveliest as in spring and blossom-time, with astounding magnificence and variety. Every single one owes its life to being representative, 
for there is nothing that is not a representation and does not carry some celestial or spiritual meaning. In this way they not only delight the eye but also fill the mind with happiness.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 There were certain souls recently arrived from the world who, on account of the assumptions they had adopted during their lifetime, doubted whether things of this sort could possibly be found 
in the next life where there is no wood or stone. They were brought up to that place, and from there they talked to me. In their amazement they said that it was beyond description, that they could never 
think of any way of representing how far beyond description it was, and that forms of joy and happiness shone from every detail - and this in ever-changing variety. Souls who are introduced into heaven 
normally make first of all for the paradise gardens. The angels however look at those gardens quite differently. It is not the gardens that delight them but what they represent, the celestial and 
spiritual things which give rise to them. These also account for the paradise gardens which the Most Ancient Church had. </p>

</p><b>1622.</b>
Quod paradisiaca attinet, illa stupenda sunt; sistuntur in conspectum horti paradisiaci immensae extensionis ex omnis generis arboribus, tanta pulchritudine et amoenitate ut omnem cogitationis ideam 
excedant; ac ita vive coram visu eorum externo ut videant non solum, sed etiam percipiant singula vividius multo quam visus oculi capit talia in tellure: ne dubitarem de eo, perductus quoque sum illuc; 
est antrorsum paulo superius ad angulum oculi dextri, ubi illi sunt qui paradisiacam vitam vivunt, et vidi; apparent omnia et singula ut in suo pulcherrimo vere et flore cum stupenda magnificentia 
et varietate; vivunt omnia et singula ex repraesentativis, nam nihil non repraesentat et significat aliquod caeleste et spirituale, ita non solum afficiunt visum amoenitate sed etiam mentem felicitate. 
 [2] Quaedam animae recentes e mundo quae ex principiis captis dum vixerunt, dubitabant quod similia existere possent in altera vita ubi non lignum et lapis, illuc sublati, et inde mecum locuti; ex 
stupore in quo fuerunt, dicebant quod ineffabile, et quod ineffabilitatem nusquam aliqua idea repraesentare possent, quodque jucunditates et felicitates elucerent ex singulis, et hoc cum varietatibus 
succedentibus.  Animae quae in caelum introducuntur, feruntur ut plurimum omni primo ad paradisiaca. Sed angeli spectant illa oculis aliis; non delectant illos paradisi sed repraesentativa, ita caelestia 
et spiritualia ex quibus sunt.  Ex illis Antiquissima Ecclesia sua paradisiaca habuit. </p>
