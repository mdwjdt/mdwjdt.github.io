<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1201节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1201.</strong>“西顿”表对属灵事物的外在认知。这从他被称作迦南的“长子”清楚可知，因为就内义而言，每个教会的长子都是信（参看<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。然而，此处由于缺乏内在事物，所以那里没有信，只有取代信的对属灵事物的外在认知，因而只有诸如犹太人所具有的那类认知。这些认知不仅是对外在敬拜仪式的认知，还是对诸如属外在敬拜教义之类的很多事物的认知。这就是“西顿”的含义，这一点从以下事实明显可知，即推罗和西顿是非利士人的边境，而且靠着海。所以，“推罗”表内在认知，“西顿”表外在认知，即对属灵事物的认知，这也可从圣言清楚看出来。耶利米书：<br />因为日子将到，要毁灭一切非利士人，剪除帮助推罗、西顿所剩下的人，原来耶和华必毁灭非利士人，就是迦斐托海岛余剩的人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.4.htm">47:4</a>）<br />此处“非利士人”表对信与仁的认知之知识，“推罗”表内在认知，“西顿”表对属灵事物的认知。<br />约珥书：<br />推罗、西顿和非利士四境的人哪，你们与我何干？你们既然夺取我的金银，又将我可爱的宝物带入你们的庙宇。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.4.htm">3:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“推罗”和“西顿”明显表认知，被称为“非利士四境”，因为“金银”和“可爱的宝物”是认知。以西结书：<br />有北方的众王子和一切西顿人都与被杀的人下到深坑。法老和他的群众必躺卧在未受割礼和被刀杀的人中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.30.htm">32:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.32.htm">32</a>）<br />此处“西顿人”表外在认知，若缺乏内在事物，外在认知无非是知识，正因如此，他才会与表示知识的法老或埃及相提并论。撒迦利亚书：<br />和邻近的哈马，以及推罗和西顿。 因为它极有智慧。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.2.htm">9:2</a>）<br />这论及大马士革。“推罗和西顿”表认知。<br />以西结书：<br />西顿和亚发的居民作你划桨的。推罗啊，你中间的智慧人作掌舵的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.8.htm">27:8</a>）<br />此处“推罗”表内在认知，她的智慧人因此被称为“掌舵的”；而“西顿”表外在认知，她的居民因此被称为“划桨的”，因为这就是内在认知与外在认知的关系。以赛亚书：<br />沿海的居民，就是靠航海的西顿商人哪！要静默无言；他们充满了你。在大水之上，西曷河的种子、尼罗河的庄稼是她的进项，作列国的大码头。西顿哪，你当惭愧！因为大海说，就是海中的保障说，我没有受过产痛，也没有生产，没有养育男子，也没有抚养童女。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“西顿”表外在认知，因没有内在事物，故它们被称为“西曷河的种子、尼罗河的庄稼，她的进项，列国的大码头”，以及“大海，海中的保障”并那“没有受过产痛，也没有生产”的。这些描述所表示的意思永远无法显明在字义中，而是显明在内义中，和先知书的其它经文一样。由于“西顿”表外在认知，故经上说它是“以色列的四围”，即属灵教会的四围（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.24.htm">28:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.26.htm">26</a>），因为外在认知就象四围。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1201.</strong> The symbolism of Sidon as a superficial knowledge of spiritual attributes can be seen from the fact that he is called Canaan's firstborn, since what is firstborn in every church is, in an inner sense, faith (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_352" target=_top>352</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>). Here, though, where there is no faith, since inner qualities are lacking, it is nothing more than a superficial knowledge of spiritual attributes, which takes the place of faith. So it is the kind of knowledge that Jews had: not only a knowledge of the ritual involved in external worship but a knowledge of other kinds of things that had to do with their worship as well, doctrinal precepts being one example.<br />The fact that Sidon symbolizes these things can also be seen from the consideration that Tyre and Sidon were the farthest boundaries of Philistia. They even bordered on the sea. So Tyre symbolized deeper knowledge and Sidon symbolized shallower knowledge — a deeper or shallower knowledge even of spiritual concepts — as the Word also demonstrates. In Jeremiah:<br />... over the day that is coming, to devastate all the Philistines, to cut down in Tyre and Sidon every survivor who helps; because Jehovah is devastating the Philistines, the remnant of the island of Caphtor. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_47_4" target=_top>Jeremiah 47:4</a>)<br />The Philistines stand for a knowledge of the religious concepts involved in faith and charity. Tyre stands for rather deep concepts and Sidon for concepts of spiritual entities.<br />[2] In Joel:<br />What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all you borders of Philistia? Because my silver and gold you have stolen, and my good, desirable things you have taken into your temples. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_joel_3_4-5" target=_top>Joel 3:4-5</a>)<br />Clearly in this passage Tyre and Sidon stand for knowledge and are called the borders of Philistia, since the silver and gold and the good, desirable things are points of knowledge. In Ezekiel:<br /> [There you find] chiefs of the north, all of them, and every Sidonian, who have all gone down with the stabbed into the pit; ... when Pharaoh with all his horde is made to lie in the middle of the uncircumcised along with those stabbed by the sword. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_32_30" target=_top>Ezekiel 32:30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_32_32" target=_top>32</a>)<br />The Sidonians stand for superficial knowledge, which in the absence of any deeper content is just a collection of facts, and that is why the Sidonians are mentioned at the same time as Pharaoh, meaning Egypt, which symbolizes facts. In Zechariah:<br />Hamath too will border on it, [as will] Tyre and Sidon, since it was very wise. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_9_2" target=_top>Zechariah 9:2</a>)<br />This is about Damascus. Tyre and Sidon stand for knowledge.<br />[3] In Ezekiel:<br />The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; your sages, Tyre, were within you; they were your captains. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_8" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:8</a>)<br />Tyre stands for rather deep knowledge, so its sages are called captains; and Sidon stands for rather superficial knowledge, so its people are called rowers, since this is the relation of deeper knowledge to shallower. In Isaiah:<br />The inhabitants of the island, the trader of Sidon crossing the sea, are silent; they have filled you up. But the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, its produce, came on many waters, and it was the merchandise of the nations. Blush, Sidon, since the sea, the stronghold of the sea spoke, saying, "I was not in labor and did not give birth and did not bring up young men, raise young women." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_2-3" target=_top>Isaiah 23:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_4-5" target=_top>4-5</a>)<br />Sidon stands for shallower knowledge that has nothing deeper inside it. Because it has nothing inside, it is called the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, its produce, the merchandise of the nations, and also the sea, the stronghold of the sea, and something that does not labor or give birth. The literal meaning of these details could never be grasped, but on an inner level their meaning is quite obvious, as it is with all other passages in the prophets.<br />Because Sidon symbolizes superficial knowledge, it is also called the periphery of Israel (the spiritual church) in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_24" target=_top>Ezekiel 28:24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1201/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_26" target=_top>26</a>, since superficial knowledge acts as a surrounding border. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1201</b></p><p><b>1201.</b>
That "Zidon" signifies exterior knowledges of spiritual things, is evident from the fact that it is called the "first-born of Canaan;" for the firstborn of every church, in the internal sense, is faith 
(n. 352, 367). But here, where there is no faith, because no internal things, there are nothing but exterior knowledges of spiritual things which are in the place of faith; thus knowledges such as 
existed among the Jews, which are knowledges not only of the rites of external worship, but also of many things, such as doctrinals, which belong to that worship. That this is the signification of "Zidon" 
is also evident from the fact that Tyre and Zidon were extreme borders of Philistia, and were moreover by the sea; and therefore by "Tyre" interior knowledges are signified, and by "Zidon" exterior 
knowledges, that is, of spiritual things-which is also evident from the Word. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     On the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper 
that remaineth; for Jehovah will lay waste the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor (Jer. 47:4). Here "the Philistines" denote the mere memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith and charity; 
"Tyre" denotes the interior knowledges, and "Zidon" the exterior knowledges, of spiritual things.  [2] In Joel:       What are ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the borders of Philistia? Forasmuch 
as ye have taken My silver and gold, and have carried into your temples My desirable good things (Joel 3:4-5). Here "Tyre and Zidon" evidently denote knowledges, and are called "the borders of 
Philistia;" "silver and gold," and "desirable good things," are knowledges. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The princes of the north, all of them, and every Zidonian who has gone down with the slain into the pit. 
When he has been made to lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain with the sword; Pharaoh and all his crowd (Ezek. 32:30, 32). "The Zidonians" here denote exterior knowledges, 
which without internal things are nothing but memory-knowledges and therefore they are named in connection with Pharaoh, or Egypt, by whom memory-knowledges are signified. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Hamath also 
shall be bordered thereon; Tyre and Zidon, because she was very wise (Zech. 9:2). The subject here is Damascus; "Tyre and Zidon" denote knowledges.  [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The inhabitants of Zidon 
and of Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots (Ezek. 27:8). Here "Tyre" denotes interior knowledges; wherefore her wise men are called "pilots;" and "Zidon" 
denotes exterior knowledges, and therefore her inhabitants are called "rowers;" for such is the relation of interior knowledges to exterior. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Let the inhabitants of the isle be silent, 
the merchant of Zidon, that passes over the sea, they have replenished thee. And in great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river was her revenue, and she was the mart of nations. Be ashamed, 
O Zidon, for the sea hath spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor caused virgins to grow up (Isa. 23:2-4). "Zidon" 
here denotes exterior knowledges, which, because there is nothing internal in them, are called "the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river her revenue, the mart of the nations," and also "the sea," 
and "the stronghold of the sea;" and it is said that she doth not "travail and bring forth"-which could not be comprehended in the literal sense, but is all perfectly clear in the internal sense; as 
is the case with other passages in the Prophets. Because "Zidon" signifies exterior knowledges, it is said to be "a circuit about Israel," that is, around the spiritual church (Ezek. 28:24, 26); for exterior 
knowledges are like a circuit round about. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1201</b></p><p><b>1201.</b>
That 'Sidon' means the exterior cognitions of spiritual things is clear from the fact that he is called 'Canaan's firstborn', for in the internal sense the firstborn of every Church is faith, see <a href="352.htm">352</a>, <a href="367.htm">367</a>. Here however, where faith does not exist because internal things are missing they are no more than exterior cognitions of spiritual things taking the place of faith, thus cognitions such as those 
with the Jews which are cognitions not only of the ceremonies of external worship but also of many other things belonging to that worship, such as matters of doctrine. That 'Sidon' has this meaning 
is also evident from the fact that Tyre and Sidon were the furthest limits of Philistia, and were in fact by the sea. 'Tyre' therefore meant interior cognitions, and 'Sidon' those which were exterior, 
and yet cognitions of spiritual things. This is also clear from the Word: in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On the day that is coming to lay waste all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that 
remains, for Jehovah is laying waste the Philistines, the remnants of the island of Caphtor. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2047:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 47:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the Philistines' stands for knowledge of the cognitions of faith and charity, 'Tyre' for 
interior cognitions, and 'Sidon' for cognitions of spiritual things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
What are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the borders of Philistia? You have taken My silver and gold, and 
My good and desirable treasures you have carried into your temples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Tyre' and 'Sidon' clearly stand for cognitions and are called 'the borders of Philistia', for 'gold and silver' 
and 'good and desirable treasures' are cognitions. In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>The princes of the north, all of them, and every Sidonian, who have gone down with the slain<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> into the pit. He was made to lie in 
the midst of the uncircumcised with those slain' by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:30,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:30, 32</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the Sidonian' stands for exterior cognitions, which when devoid of things that are 
internal are nothing else than facts, and it is for this reason that he is mentioned along with Pharaoh, or Egypt, who means facts. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Hamath also will border on it, Tyre and Sidon, for 
it is exceedingly wise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Damascus. 'Tyre and Sidon' stands for cognitions.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; your wise men, O Tyre, 
were in you, they were your pilots. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Tyre' stands for interior cognitions, and therefore her wise men are called 'pilots', while 'Sidon' stands for exterior cognitions and her 
inhabitants are therefore called 'rowers', for such is the relationship of interior cognitions to exterior. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The inhabitants of the island are silent, O merchant of Sidon passing over the 
sea; they have replenished you. But on the great waters the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the river, was her revenue, and was the merchandise of nations. Blush, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the 
stronghold of the sea saying, I have not gone into labour, nor have I given birth, nor reared young men, nor brought up virgins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:2-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:2-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Sidon' stands for exterior cognitions which, because 
they have nothing internal within them are called 'the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the river, her revenue, the merchandise of the nations', and also 'the sea, the stronghold of the sea', and 'one 
that does not go into labour and give birth'. What these expressions may mean could never be discerned in the literal sense, but their meaning is perfectly plain in the internal sense, as with everything 
else in the Prophets. Since 'Sidon' means exterior cognitions it is also referred to as the region surrounding Israel, which is the spiritual Church, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:24, 26</a>, for exterior cognitions are 
like a surrounding region.

Quod 'Zidon' significet cognitiones exteriores spiritualium, constat ex eo quod dicatur 'primogenitus Canaanis,' nam primogenitum cujuscumque Ecclesiae in sensu interno est fides, n. 352, 367; hic autem, 
ubi nulla fides quia absque internis, non sunt nisi cognitiones exteriores spiritualium quae loco fidei; ita cognitiones quales apud Judaeos, quae non solum sunt rituum cultus externi, sed etiam 
plurium quae ad cultum illum pertinent, ut sunt doctrinalia: quod 'Zidon' haec significet, etiam patet ex eo quod Tyrus et Zidon termini ultimi fuerint Philistaeae, et quidem juxta mare, et ideo per 
'Tyrum' significatae sunt cognitiones interiores, et per 'Zidonem' cognitiones exteriores, et quidem spiritualium; quod etiam constat a Verbo:  apud Jeremiam, Super diem venientem ad vastandum omnes 
Philistaeos, ad excidendum Tyro et Zidoni omnem superstitem auxiliantem, quia vastans Jehovah Philistaeos, reliquias insulae Caphtor, xlvii 4; </p>
<p>ubi 'Philistaei' pro scientiis cognitionum fidei et charitatis; 
'Tyrus' pro cognitionibus interioribus; et 'Zidon' pro cognitionibus spiritualium:  [2]apud Joelem,  Quid vos Mihi, Tyre et Zidon, et omnes termini Philistaeae?  ...quod argentum Meum et aurum 
sumpsistis, et desiderabilia Mea bona intulistis in templa vestra, iv 4, 5 [A.V. iii 4,  ubi manifeste 'Tyrus et Zidon' pro cognitionibus, et vocantur 'termini Philistaeae,' 'argentum' enim et 'aurum,

cum confossis gladio, Pharao et omnis turba ejus, xxxii 30, 32; </p>
<p>ubi 'Zidonius' pro cognitionibus exterioribus, quae absque internis non sunt nisi quam scientifica; quare simul nominatur 
cum 'Pharaone seu Aegypto,' per quem scientifica significantur:  apud Zachariam, Etiam Hamath terminabitur in ea, Tyrus et Zidon, nam sapiens fuit valde, ix 2;@ubi de Damasco; 'Tyrus et Zidon' pro cognitionibus:

in sensu interno, sicut in reliquis apud Prophetas.  Quia 'Zidon' significat cognitiones exteriores etiam vocatur 'circuitus Israelis,' seu Ecclesiae spiritualis, Ezech xxviii 24, 26, nam se habent 
cognitiones exteriores sicut circuitus.@$ </p>
