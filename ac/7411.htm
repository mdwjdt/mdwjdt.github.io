<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7411.</strong>“法老见自己又能呼吸了”表不再厌倦。这从“又能呼吸”的含义清楚可知，“又能呼吸”是指这一事实：不再有任何不快乐的事，因而不再有任何厌倦。至于那些使用由纯粹的虚假所生的推理之人所经历的厌倦和不快乐，可参看前文（<a href="7392.htm">7392</a>节）。快乐的事会使得一个人自由而充分地呼吸；而不快乐的事则使得他既不能自由也不能充分地呼吸。正因如此，他“又能呼吸”表示不再有不快乐的事，或不再厌倦。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7411</b></p><p><b>7411.</b>
And Pharaoh saw there was breathing. That this signifies that the weariness ceased, is evident from the signification of "there being breathing," as being that there was no longer what was undelightful, 
thus that there was no longer weariness. (That it was wearisome and undelightful to them to reason from mere falsities, see above, n. 7392.) That which is delightful causes man to breathe freely and 
fully; but that which is undelightful causes him to breathe neither freely nor fully; hence it is that by "there being breathing," is signified that what was undelightful or wearisome ceased. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7411</b></p><p><b>7411.</b>
'And Pharaoh saw that he could breathe again' means that the weariness ceased. This is clear from the meaning of 'that he could breathe again' as the fact that there was no longer anything undelightful, 
and so no longer any weariness. Regarding the weariness and lack of delight experienced by those who use reasonings that arise from utter falsities, see above in <a href="7392.htm">7392</a>. What is delightful causes a 
person to breathe freely and fully, whereas what is undelightful prevents him from breathing freely or fully. So it is that 'he could breathe again' means that what was undelightful - that is, the weariness 
- ceased.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7411</b>
</p><b>7411.</b>
`Et vidit Pharao quod facta respiratio': quod significet quod taedium cessaverit, constat ex significatione `quod facta respiratio' quod sit quod non amplius injucundum, ita quod non amplius taedium; 
quod taedium et injucundum fuerit illis ratiocinari ex meris falsis, videatur supra n. 7392; {1} jucundum facit homini respirare libere et plene, injucundum autem non libere nec plene; inde est quod 
per `facta respiratio' significetur quod injucundum seu taedium cessaverit. 	@1 i etiam$ </p>
