<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5869节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5869.</strong>“约瑟在所有侍立在他旁边的人面前忍不住了”表内在属天层已为联结预备好一切。这从“约瑟”的代表和“忍不住了”的含义清楚可知：“约瑟”是指内在良善（参看<a href="5805.htm">5805</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5827.htm">5827</a>节），因而是指内在属天层，因为“属天层”表示从主发出的良善；“忍不住了”是指一切都为联结预备好了。因为当有人为了某个目的或结果而通过寻求并安排方法去实现它而迫不及待地预备自己时，一旦一切预备妥当，他就再也忍不住了。这就是上述那些话的含义；因为前一章论述了为实现联结所采取的初步措施，而本章则论述实际的联结（参看<a href="5867.htm">5867</a>节）。“所有侍立在他旁边的人”表示妨碍联结的那类事物，它们因此被逐出，如下文所述。</p>

And Joseph could not restrain himself before all that were standing by him. That this signifies that all things were now made ready by the internal celestial for conjunction, is evident from the representation 
of Joseph, as being internal good (see n. 5805, 5826, 5827), thus the internal celestial, for by the celestial is meant the good which proceeds from the Lord; and from the signification of 
"not being able to restrain himself," as being that all things were made ready for conjunction. For when anyone prepares himself with the utmost diligence for some end, or effect, by getting together 
and arranging the means conducive thereto, then when all things are made ready he can no longer restrain himself. This is signified by the above words; for in the preceding chapter initiation to conjunction 
was treated of, but in this chapter conjunction itself (see n. 5867). By "all that were standing by him," are signified such things as hinder conjunction, for which reason they were cast out, as follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5869</b></p><p><b>5869.</b>
'And Joseph could not contain himself before all those standing with him' means that now everything had been prepared by the internal celestial for the joining together. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Joseph' as internal good, dealt with in <a href="5805.htm">5805</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5827.htm">5827</a>, thus the internal celestial, for the expression 'the celestial' is used to mean good that emanates from the Lord; and from the meaning 
of 'not being able to contain himself' as the fact that everything had been prepared for the joining together. For when someone prepares himself most eagerly to achieve some end or effect, by seeking 
out and organizing the means to achieve it, he can no longer contain himself once all the preparations are complete. This is the meaning of the words under consideration here. For the chapter before 
this dealt with the initial steps that were taken to achieve the joining together, whereas the present chapter deals with the actual joining together, see <a href="5867.htm">5867</a>. 'All those standing with him' means 
the kinds of things which prevent the joining together and which were therefore cast away, as stated in what follows. </p>

</p><b>5869.</b>
`Et non potuit Joseph continere se ad omnes stantes apud illum': quod significet quod omnia nunc a caelesti interno parata sint ad conjunctionem, constat a repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit bonum 
internum, de qua n. 5805, 5826, 5827, ita caeleste internum, nam per caeleste intelligitur bonum quod procedit a Domino; et a significatione `non posse continere se' quod sit quod omnia parata sint ad 
conjunctionem; cum enim aliquis summo studio praeparat se ad aliquem finem, seu effectum, conquirendo et disponendo media ad illum, tunc cum omnia parata sunt, non amplius se continere potest; hoc significatur 
per illa verba; nam in capite quod praecedit, actum est de initiatione ad conjunctionem, in hoc autem capite de ipsa conjunctione, videatur n. 5867. Per `omnes stantes apud illum' significantur 
talia quae conjunctionem impediunt, quapropter ejecta{1}, ut sequitur. @1 i sunt$ </p>
