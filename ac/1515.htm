<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1515节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1515.</strong>我曾察觉出一个女人的恶臭气场，后来，她与塞壬们混在一起；无论她到哪，她所散发的恶臭都会持续好几天。灵人们说，那恶臭似乎能致命；然而，她本人对此浑然不觉。塞壬们的臭味都差不多，因为她们的内在是污秽的，而她们的外表绝大部分漂亮好看（参看<a href="831.htm">831</a>节）。一个值得注意的事实是，在来世，塞壬们很快就学会那里的一切，而且比别人更清楚事情是怎么回事，包括教义；但她们学习这一切的目的是为了将其转为巫术，并妄图控制他人。她通过模仿善与真而进入善人的情感；但其秉性却一如从前。这清楚表明，若人不变成教义所教导的样子，即不以生活为目的，那么教义一文不值。除了她们外，地狱居民中还有很多人比其他人更精通教义。不过，那些过着仁爱生活的人全都在天堂。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1515.</strong> I perceived the aura of stench from a certain woman who later joined a group of sirens, and the stench emanated from her wherever she went for a period of several days. The spirits said that the reek was almost lethal, but still the woman herself did not smell it at all.<br />Sirens have essentially the same foul smell, since their inner depths are revolting, although their outer looks are mostly attractive and fetching. For more about them, see 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1515/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_831" target=_top>831</a>.<br />Surprisingly, sirens in the other world catch on quickly to everything there and see how things stand better than others do, even in regard to doctrinal matters. Their whole focus, however, is to turn what they learn into magic and seize power over others. They enter into good people's feelings by a pretense of virtue and truth, but their nature is nevertheless as described.<br />This shows that doctrine is worthless unless we become what it teaches us to become 钬?that is, unless our goal is to use it in our lives. Besides, hellish spirits count among their number many people who displayed more skill at doctrinal questions than others. People who have lived a charitable life, though, are all in heaven. </p>

The sphere of the stench of a certain woman was perceived, who was afterwards associated with sirens; and that stench exhaled for some days wherever she went. The spirits said that the stench seemed 
deadly; yet she perceived nothing of it. The stench of sirens is similar, because their interiors are filthy, while their exteriors are for the most part becoming and fair (see n. 831). It is wonderful 
how quickly the sirens in the other life learn all things there, and know better than others how things are, even matters of doctrine; but all to the end that they may turn them into magic, and arrogate 
to themselves command over others. They enter into the affections of the good by the simulation of good and truth; but still their quality remains, which shows that what is doctrinal is nothing, 
unless the man becomes as it teaches, that is, unless he has the life as the end in view; and besides, there are many among the infernals who had been preeminently skilled in doctrinal things. But they 
who have lived a life of charity are all in heaven.  </p>

I once perceived the sphere of the stench of a woman who afterwards entered into association with sirens, and for a period of several days that stench emanated from her wherever she went. The spirits 
said the stench appeared to be deadly, though she herself did not perceive it at all. The stench of the sirens is similar because their interiors are filthy, but their exteriors are for the most part 
attractive and good looking. Such have been described in <a href="831.htm">831</a>. It is a remarkable fact that in the next life sirens mentally take in everything there, and have a better knowledge than others have of the 
nature of things, even matters of doctrine. But they take everything in to the end that they may turn it into magic and give themselves dominion over others. By a presence of good and truth they enter 
into good people's affections, but their own dispositions remain such as they were before. From this it becomes clear that a matter of doctrine has no value at all unless a person so becomes what 
it teaches, that is, unless he keeps life as the end in view There are in addition many among the inhabitants of hell who have been more expert in matters of doctrine than anybody else. But those who 
have led charitable lives are all in heaven. </p>

</p><b>1515.</b>
Sphaera fetoris percepta alicujus feminae quae postea sirenibus associata, et fetor iste exhalabat per aliquot dierum tempus ubicumque venit; spiritus dicebant quod fetor quasi lethalis esset, illa 
tamen nihil de fetore isto sentiebat. Sirenum fetor est similis, quia interiora earum sunt spurca, sed exteriora ut plurimum decora et speciosa, de quibus n. 831; quod mirum, sirenes in altera vita arripiunt 
omnia quae ibi sunt, et prae aliis sciunt quomodo res se habet; etiam doctrinalia, sed omnia ob finem ut vertant in magica, et sibi arrogent imperium super alios; in affectiones bonorum intrant 
simulatione boni et veri, sed usque tales sunt: inde constare potest quod doctrinale sit nihil nisi homo ita fiat sicut docet, hoc est, nisi pro fine habeat vitam; praeter quod multi inter infernales 
sint qui doctrinalia prae aliis calluerunt: sed qui vitam charitatis vixerunt, omnes sunt in caelo. </p>
