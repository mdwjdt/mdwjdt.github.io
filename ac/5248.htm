<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5248节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5248.</strong>“换衣裳”表就内层属世层的覆盖物而言，通过披上适合它之物所作的改变。这从“换”和“衣裳”的含义清楚可知：“换”（即改变）是指移除和抛弃；“衣裳”是指内层属世层的覆盖物，如下文所述。由此可知，披上的是新“衣裳”所表示的适合之物。圣言经常提到“衣服”，以此表示在下面或外面，用来覆盖在上面或里面的事物。因此，“衣服”表示人的外在，因而表示他的属世之物，因为该事物覆盖他的内在和属灵部分。“衣服”尤表属于信的真理，因为这些覆盖属于仁的良善。“衣服”的这种含义来源于灵人和天使看上去所穿的衣服。灵人看上去穿着缺乏亮光的衣服，而天使看上去穿着充满亮光的衣服，可以说是由亮光做成的。因为他们周围的亮光本身看似一件衣服，和主在变形像时的衣裳差不多，这衣裳“洁白如光”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）、“洁白放光”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.29.htm">9:29</a>）。从他们所穿的衣服也能辨别就信之真理而言，他们是哪类灵人和天使，因为这些由他们的衣服来代表，尽管诸如存在于属世层里面的那类信之真理。诸如存在于理性层里面的信之真理就表现在脸和它所拥有的美丽上。其衣服的亮光来源于爱与仁之良善，因为这良善通过照耀而产生亮光。由此可见衣服在灵界代表什么，因而“衣服”在灵义上表示什么。<br />但约瑟所换下，也就是脱下的衣裳是坑里或监里的衣服；这些衣服表示在试探状态下由恶魔和恶灵所激发的错误和虚假的观念。因此，他“换衣裳”表示就内层属世层的覆盖物而言的抛弃和所作的改变。他所换上的衣裳表示诸如适合的那类事物；因而表示披上适合的事物。可参看前面关于衣服的阐述和说明：属天事物是裸露的，而属灵和属世事物不是（<a href="297.htm">297</a>节）；“衣服”表示相对它们所包裹之物来说较为低级的真理（<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节）；“换衣服”代表需要披上神圣真理，因此“衣服的更换”具有相同的含义（<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>节）；“撕裂衣服”代表为真理的丧失和毁灭而哀悼（参看<a href="4763.htm">4763</a>节）；没穿婚礼的礼服进来的人是什么意思（<a href="2132.htm">2132</a>节）。</p>

And changed his garments. That this signifies as to what is of the interior natural, by putting on what is suitable, is evident from the signification of "changing," as being to remove and reject; and 
from the signification of "garments," as being what is of the interior natural (of which presently); hence it follows that what was suitable (signified by the new "garments") was put on. "Garments" 
are often mentioned in the Word, and thereby are meant things beneath or without, and that cover things above or within; and therefore by "garments" are signified man's external, consequently his natural, 
because this covers his internal and spiritual. Specifically by "garments" are signified truths that are of faith, because these cover the goods that are of charity. This signification has its origin 
from the garments in which spirits and angels appear clothed. Spirits appear in garments devoid of brightness, but angels in garments that are bright and are as it were made of brightness, for the 
very brightness around them appears as a garment, as appeared the raiment of the Lord when He was transfigured, which was "as the light" (Matt. 17:2), and was "white and flashing" (Luke 9:29). From 
their garments also the quality of spirits and angels can be known in respect to the truths of faith, because these are represented by garments, but truths of faith such as they are in the natural; for 
such as they are in the rational appears from the face and its beauty. The brightness of their garments comes from the good of love and of charity, which by shining through causes the brightness. From 
all this it is evident what is represented in the spiritual world by the garments, and consequently what is meant by "garments" in the spiritual sense. But the garments that Joseph changed, that is, 
put off, were the garments of the pit or prison, and by these are signified things fallacious and false, which in a state of temptations are excited by evil genii and spirits; and therefore by his "changing 
his garments" is signified rejection and change in respect to what is of the interior natural, and the garments he put on denoted such things as would be suitable, and therefore the putting on 
of things suitable is signified. See what has before been said and shown concerning garments: that what is celestial is not clothed, but what is spiritual and natural (n. 297); that "garments" denote 
truths relatively lower (n. 1073, 2576); that changing the garments was a representative of holy truths being put on, whence also came the changes of garments (n. 4545); that rending the garments was 
representative of mourning over truth lost and destroyed (see n. 4763); and what is signified by him that came in, not having on a wedding garment (n. 2132). </p>

'And changed his clothes' means the change made so far as coverings of the interior natural were concerned, by the putting on of what was rightly suited to this. This is clear from the meaning of 'changing 
as removing and casting aside, and from the meaning of 'clothes' as the coverings of the interior natural, dealt with below. The putting on of what was rightly suited, meant by 'new clothes', follows 
on from this. Frequent reference is made in the Word to clothes, by which are meant lower or outward things which, being such, serve to cover higher or inward ones. 'Clothes' consequently means 
the external part of man and therefore what is natural, since this covers the internal and the spiritual part of him. In particular 'clothes' means truths that are matters of faith since these cover 
forms of good that are embodiments of charity. This meaning of 'clothes' has its origin in the clothes that spirits and angels are seen to be wearing. Spirits are seen dressed in clothes that have no 
brightness, whereas angels are seen dressed in clothes full of brightness and so to speak made of brightness. For the actual brightness that surrounds them looks like a robe, much like the Lord's garments 
when He was transfigured, which were 'as the light', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>, and 'glistening white', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:29</a>. From the clothes they wear one can also tell what kinds of spirits and angels they are so far as 
truths of faith are concerned since these are represented by their clothes, though only truths of faith such as exist within the natural. The truths of faith such as exist within the rational are revealed 
in the face and in the beauty it possesses. The brightness of their garments has its origin in the good of love and charity, for that good shines through and is the producer of the brightness. 
From all this one may see what is represented in the spiritual world by clothes and as a consequence what is meant in the spiritual sense by 'clothes'. </p>

 But the clothes which Joseph changed - that 
is, cast aside - were those of the pit or prison-clothing, which mean the delusions and false ideas that are stirred up by evil genii and spirits in a state involving temptations. Consequently the 
expression 'he changed his clothes' means a casting aside and a change made in the coverings of the interior natural. And the clothes which he put on were ones such as were properly suitable, so that 
the putting on of what was rightly suited is meant. See what has been stated and shown already regarding clothes, </p>
<p>Celestial things are unclothed, but not so spiritual and natural ones, <a href="297.htm">297</a>. </p>
<p>'Clothes' 
are truths, which are of a lower nature when they are compared with what they cover, <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>. </p>
<p>'Changing one's garments' was representative of the need to put on holy truths, and therefore 
'changes of garments' had the same meaning, <a href="4545.htm">4545</a>. </p>
<p>'Rending one's clothes' was representative of mourning on account of the loss of truth, <a href="4763.htm">4763</a>. </p>

`Et mutavit vestes {1}':  quod significet quoad illa quae  sunt interioris naturalis, induendo convenientia, constat a significatione `mutare' quod sit removere et rejicere; et ex significatione `vestium' 
quod sint illa quae sunt interioris naturalis, de qua sequitur; quod induerit convenientia, quae per `novas vestes' significantur, inde fluit.  Vestes memorantur saepius in Verbo et per illas intelliguntur 
ea quae infra seu extra sunt ac tegunt ea quae supra seu intra sunt; quapropter per `vestes' significatur externum hominis, proinde naturale, nam hoc tegit internum ejus et spirituale; in 
specie per `vestes' significantur vera quae fidei, quia haec tegunt bona quae   charitatis; hoc significativum habet originem suam ex vestibus quibus spiritus et angeli apparent induti; spiritus apparent 
in vestibus absque splendore, angeli autem in vestibus cum splendore, et quasi a splendore, nam ipse splendor circum illos apparet sicut vestis, ad instar sicut vestimenta {2}Domini cum transformatus, 
{3}quae fuerunt sicut lux, Matth. xvii 2, et sicut album fulgurans, Luc. ix 29; ex vestibus etiam spiritus et angeli cognosci possunt quales sunt quoad vera fidei, quia haec per `vestes' repraesentantur, 
sed vera fidei qualia sunt in naturali; qualia autem in rationali apparet ex facie et ejus pulchritudine;   splendor qui vestibus (c)eorum, est ex bono amoris et charitatis; hoc bonum per translucentiam 
dat splendorem; ex his constare potest  {4}quid per vestes repraesentatur in spirituali mundo, consequenter quid vestes sunt in spirituali sensu.  [2]Vestes autem quas Josephus mutavit, nempe 
quas exuit, fuerunt vestes foveae seu carceris, per quas significantur fallacia et falsa quae in tentationum statu a malis geniis et spiritibus excitantur, quapropter per `mutavit vestes' significatur 
rejectio et mutatio quoad illa quae interioris naturalis; et vestes quas induit, fuerunt talia quae convenirent, quapropter etiam significatur induitio convenientium.  Videantur quae prius de vestibus 
dicta et ostensa sunt, nempe, quod caelestia non vestiantur, sed spiritualia et naturalia, n. 297:  quod `vestes' sint vera inferiora   respective, n. 1073, 2576:  quod `mutare vestes' fuerit repraesentativum 
quod induerentur sancta vera, inde quoque `vestes mutatoriae', n. 4545: quod `discindere vestes' fuerit repraesentativum luctus super verum amissum et deperditum, n. 4763: quid significatur 
per `illum qui intravit non veste nuptiali indutus', n. 2132. @1 A I here o suas; cp 5243$ @2 Domino I$ @3 cujus vestimenta$ @4 A reverses, thus quid ...sensu, hoc est, quid ...mundo; I has
