<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">代表与对应（续）</h4><br />3337.前面已阐述和说明了何为对应，何为代表；即属天堂之光的事物和属尘世之光的事物之间存在对应关系；并且显现在属尘世之光事物中的属天堂之光的事物就是代表（<a href="3225.htm">3225</a>节）。但何为天堂之光及其性质，却不那么容易为人所知，因为人居于属尘世之光的事物中；并且他越居于这些事物，存在于天堂之光中的事物就越向他显为黑暗如无物。当生命流入时，这两种光，就是天堂之光和尘世之光，就形成人的全部聪明。人的想像无非是诸如他通过肉体视觉所看到的那类事物的形式和形状，这些形式和形状以神奇的方式发生变化，可以说被修改。他的内在想像，或思维则无非是诸如他通过心灵视觉所吸收的那类事物的形式和形状，这些形式和和形状以更神奇的方式发生变化，可以说被修改。以这种方式所形成的事物本身是没有生命的，但因从主所流入的生命而变得具有生气。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCES AND REPRESENTATIONS.      What correspondences are, and what representations, may appear from what has been said and shown above, namely, that there are correspondences 
between the things which are of the light of heaven and those which are of the light of the world; and that the things which take place in those which are of the light of the world are representations 
(n. 3225). But what the light of heaven is and what is its quality cannot be very well known to man, because he is in the things that are of the light of the world; and insofar as he is in 
these, the things that are in the light of heaven appear to him as darkness, and as nothing. It is these two lights which-life flowing in-produce all the intelligence of man. The imagination of man consists 
solely of the forms and appearances of such things as have been received by bodily vision wonderfully varied, and so to speak modified; but his interior imagination, or thought, consists solely 
of the forms and appearances of such things as have been drawn in through the mind's vision still more wonderfully varied, and so to speak modified. The things which come forth from this source are 
in themselves inanimate, but become animate through the influx of life from the Lord. </p>

CORRESPONDENCES AND REPRESENTATIONS- continued </p>
<p>What correspondences are, and what representations are, may be seen from what has been stated and shown already; namely that correspondences exist between 
things belonging to the light of heaven and those belonging to the light of the world, while representations consist of things belonging to the light of heaven which manifest themselves within those 
belonging to the light of the world, <a href="3225.htm">3225</a>. But what the light of heaven is, and the nature of it, cannot be known so easily by man because he dwells within the things that belong to the light of 
the world. And to the extent he dwells within these the things that exist within the light of heaven are seen by him as darkness and as nothing at all. These two, the light of heaven and the light of 
the world, are what form the whole of man's intelligence, when life is flowing in. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In man mental images are nothing else than the forms and shapes of such things as he has been taking in with his 
physical sight - forms and shapes wonderfully diverse or, as I will call it, modified. His interior mental images or thought however are nothing else than the forms and shapes of such things as he 
has absorbed with his mental sight - forms and shapes even more wonderfully diverse or, as again I will call it, modified. Things which come into being in this way are not in themselves animate but are 
made so from the influx of life from the Lord. </p>

Continuatio de (t)Correspondentiis et Repraesentationibus </p>
<p>Quid correspondentiae et quid repraesentationes, constare potest ab illis quae prius dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe inter illa quae sunt 
lucis caeli et lucis mundi, sint correspondentiae, et quae existunt in illis quae sunt lucis mundi, sint repraesentationes, n. 3225; sed quid et qualis lux caeli, non ita homini notum esse potest, 
quia homo est in illis quae sunt lucis mundi; et quantum in his, tantum illa quae in luce caeli sunt, apparent illi ut tenebrae ac ut nihil: hae binae luces sunt quae omnem intelligentiam hominis faciunt, 
2 {1}influente vita: imaginatio hominis non est nisi quam (t)formae et species talium quae visu corporis ceperat, mirabiliter variatae, ac ut ita dicam modificatae; imaginatio autem interior seu 
cogitatio ejus, nec est nisi quam (t)formae et species talium quae visu mentis hauserat, adhuc mirabilius variatae, ac ut ita dicam modificatae: illa quae inde existunt, in se inanimata sunt, sed ex influxu 
vitae a Domino animata fiunt. @1 accedente$  </p>
