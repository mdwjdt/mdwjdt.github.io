<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2643节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2643.</strong>“谁能对亚伯拉罕说，撒拉要乳养儿子呢”表主凭自己的力量将人性植入在神性中。这从亚伯拉罕和撒拉的代表物，以及“乳养”和“儿子”的含义清楚可知。亚伯拉罕代表神性良善，撒拉代表神性真理，这在前面早已说明。“乳（即奶，milk）”表来自一个属天源头的属灵之物，也就是源于良善的真理（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节）；因此“乳养”表示植入这真理。“儿子”是指真理，在此是指存在于理性当中的真理，这一点从“儿子”的含义明显看出来（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="490.htm">490</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>节）。从内义上来考虑，这些话表示主凭自己的力量将人性植入在神性中。其原因在于，神性真理与神圣人性是一回事；当论及这神圣人性时，经上说为亚伯拉罕“乳养儿子”，意思是，祂将人性植入在神性中；由于这是祂所植入的人性，故祂是凭自己的力量这样做的。不过，这些事很难解释得更清楚、更明白。说得越多，反而越说不清楚；因为这些都是神性事物，而神性事物只能通过属天和属灵之物呈现给众天使。若以更高尚的方式呈现给世人，这些事必落入世人所具有的物质和肉体观念中。<br />而且，要知道，主的神圣理性刚出生时，其性质是用这些话来描述的：“神使我喜笑，凡听见的必与我一同喜笑。又说，谁能对亚伯拉罕说，撒拉要乳养儿子呢？因为我给年老的他生了一个儿子”。因为按照古人的习俗，孩子出生时，所取的名字表示状态，同时也描述了当时的状态。如夏娃与亚当生该隐之时（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创4.1.htm">4:1</a>）；以及夏娃与亚当生塞特（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创4.25.htm">4:25</a>）、拉麦生挪亚（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.29.htm">5:29</a>）、以撒生以扫和雅各（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.25.htm">25:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.26.htm">26</a>）、雅各生十二个儿子（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.32.htm">29:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.6.htm">30:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.18.htm">35:18</a>）、他玛生法勒斯和谢拉（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创38.29.htm">38:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创38.30.htm">30</a>）、约瑟生玛拿西和以法莲（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.51.htm">41:51</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.52.htm">52</a>）、摩西生革舜和以利以谢（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出2.22.htm">2:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出18.4.htm">18:4</a>）之时。所有这些人代表什么，在内义上表示什么，都体现在对所取之名进一步的描述上。此处以撒所代表和表示的，也是这种情况。至于这个名字包含什么，可从所给出的简要解释在某种程度上明显看出来。不过，那里面仍隐藏着更深层次的奥秘，因为它们是神性事物，神性事物是无法用任何句子或短语的形式来表达的。</p>

Who would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons? That this signifies that the Lord implanted the Human in the Divine by His own power, is evident from the representation of Abraham, and also 
of Sarah, and from the signification of "suckling" and of "sons." That Abraham represents Divine good, and Sarah Divine truth, has been shown before. That "milk" denotes what is spiritual from a celestial 
origin, or truth from good, may be seen above (n. 2184); and thus to "suckle" is to implant it. That "sons" are truths, here those that are in the rational, is evident from the signification of 
"sons" (n. 489, 490, 491, 533). That these things signify in the internal sense that the Lord implanted the Human in the Divine by His own power, is because the Divine truth is the same as the Divine 
Human; and when it is said of this that it "suckles sons to Abraham," the signification is that it has implanted the Human in the Divine; and as it was the Human, He did it from His own power. But these 
things can with difficulty be explained more clearly to the understanding. If many words be used, the sense will become still more obscure; for these are Divine things, which can only be presented 
before angels by things celestial and spiritual; and if they were presented before man in any more elevated style, they would fall into the material and corporeal ideas which man has. [2] It is further 
to be known that the Lord's Divine rational is described as to its quality when it was first born in the words, "God hath made laughter for me; everyone that heareth will laugh with me; and she said, 
Who would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons?" For it was according to ancient custom, that when a child was born, a name was given significative of the state; and that the state also 
was then described; as when Cain was born to Eve and Adam (Gen. 4:1); when Sheth was born to them (Gen. 4:25); when Noah was born to Lamech (Gen. 5:29); when Esau and Jacob were born to Isaac (Gen. 25:25-26); 
when the twelve sons were born to Jacob (Gen. 29:32-35; 30:6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24; 35:18); when Perez and Zerah were born to Tamar (Gen. 38:29-30); when Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph 
(Gen. 41:51, 52); when Gershom and Eliezer were born to Moses (Exod. 2:22; 18:4). What all these represent, and what they signify in the internal sense, was involved in the descriptions added to 
the names which were given; thus here what Isaac represents. What is involved is manifest in some degree from this brief explication, but deeper arcana yet are hidden within; for they are Divine things, 
which can be expressed by no forms or formulas of expression. </p>

'Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle sons?' means that by His own power the Lord implanted the Human within the Divine. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' and also of 'Sarah', 
and from the meaning of 'suckling', and of 'sons'. It has been shown already that 'Abraham' represents Divine Good and 'Sarah' Divine Truth. 'Milk' means that which is spiritual from a celestial 
origin, that is, truth deriving from good, see <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, so that 'suckling' means implanting that truth; And 'sons' means truths, here truths that exist in the Rational, as is clear from the meaning of 
'sons', <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>. The reason why in the internal sense the words under consideration mean that the Lord by His own power implanted the Human within the Divine is that Divine Truth is one and the same 
as the Divine Human, and when in reference to this it is said 'to suckle sons for Abraham' the meaning is that He implanted the Human within the Divine; and as it was the Human He implanted, He did 
so by His own power. But scarcely any clearer and more intelligible explanation of these matters is possible. To say more would obscure still further what is meant; for these are Divine matters, which 
can be presented to angels alone by means of celestial and spiritual things. If presented to men in some more exalted manner those matters would fall into the material and bodily ideas which men possess. </p>

What is more, it should be recognized that it is the nature of the Lord's Divine Rational when it was first born that is being described by these words, 'God has made laughter for me; everyone 
that hears will laugh for me; and she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle sons?' For this was in keeping with an ancient custom that when an infant was born it was given a name 
which served to mean the state; and at the same time a description of that state was added, as when Cain was born to Eve and Adam, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%204:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 4: 1</a>, and when Seth was born to the same, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%204:%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 4: 25</a>; and as 
when Noah was born to Lamech, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%205:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 5: 29</a>, Esau and Jacob to Isaac, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2025:%2025,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 25: 25, 26</a>, the twelve sons to Jacob, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2029:%2032-35;%2030:%206,%208,%2011,%2013,%2018,%2020,%2024;%2035:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 29: 32-35; 30: 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24; 35: 18</a>, Perez and Zerah to Tamar, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2038:%2029,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 38: 29, 30</a>, Manasseh and Ephraim to Joseph, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2041:%2051,%2052&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 41: 51, 52</a>, and Gershom and Eliezer to Moses, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%202:%2022;%2018:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 2: 22; 18: 4</a>. What all these represent, and what they mean in the internal sense, was embodied in the descriptions 
added to the names that were given. The same is the case here with what Isaac represents and means. What this name embodies is evident to some small extent from this brief explanation that 
has been given, but deeper arcana are nevertheless concealed there since they are Divine matters, which no sentences or phrases can be formed to express. </p>

`Quis dixisset Abrahamo, Lactabit filios Sarah?': quo significet quod Dominus propria potentia implantaverit Humanum Divino, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami,' tum `Sarae,' et significatione `lactare' 
et `filiorum'; quod `Abraham' repraesentet Divinum Bonum, et `Sarah' Divinum Verum, ostensum est; quo `lac' sit spirituale ex origine caelesti, seu verum ex bono, videatur n. 2184, ita `lactare' 
est implantare illud; quod `filii' sint vera, hi quae in Rationali, constat ex significatione `filiorum,' n. 489-491, 531 quod haec in sensu interno significent quod Dominus ex propria potentia (t)Humanum 
implantaverit Divino, est quia Divinum Verum est idem ac Divinum Humanum, de quo cum dicitur quod `lactet filios Abrahamo,' significatur quod Humanum implantaverit Divino, et quia Humanum, est 
ex propria potentia: sed haec aegre queunt clarius ad intellectum explicari; si pluribus, obscurescet sensus adhuc magis, nam sunt Divina, quae solum coram angelis per caelestia et spiritualia sisti 
queunt; si coram homine aliquo stilo elevatiore, caderent in ideas materiales et corporeas quas homo habet {1}.  [2] Praeterea sciendum, quod Divinum Rationale Domini quoad quale cum primo natum es describatur 
his verbis, `Risum fecit mihi Deus, omnis audiens ridebit mihi: et dixit, Quis dixisset Abraham, Lactabit filios Sarah?' e more antiquo enim fuit, cum nasceretur infans, quod nomen significativum 
status inderetur, et quod status tunc quoque describeretur, sicut cum Cain nasceretur Havae et Adamo, Gen. iv 1; cum Sheth illis, Gen. iv 25; cum Noah Lamecho, Gen. v 29; cum Esavus et Jacobi Isaco, 
Gen. xxv 25, 26; cum duodecim filii Jacobo, Gen. xxix 32-3: xxx 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24; xxxv 18; cum Perez et Zerah Tamari Gen. xxxviii 29, 30; cum Menasheh et Ephraim Josepho, Gen. xli 51, 52; 
cum Gershom et Eliezer Mosi, Exod. ii 22; xviii 4: quid hi omnes repraesentant, et quid significant in sensu interno, descriptioni adjunctae nomini quod indebatur, involutum est; ita hic quid Jishak; 
quid autem involvitur, patet aliquantisper a summaria explicatione, sed arcaniora usque recondita sunt, nam sunt Divina, quae nullis formis et formulis vocum expressibilia sunt. 	@1 i in quibus nihil
