<p><strong>[NCE]257.</strong> The fact that the snake's head means the tyranny of evil in general and of self-love in particular can be seen in the nature of self-love. Its character is such that it seeks power, and not just power but power over everything on earth. Not stopping there, it strives for control over everything in heaven. Even then it does not rest but aims for power over the Lord. And in fact it still would not rest at that point. This tendency lies hidden in every single glimmer of self-love. Just indulge that love and ease the restraints on it and you will find that it instantly rushes out and swells to those dimensions.<br />You can therefore see how the snake — the evil of self-love — wishes to dominate, and how it hates anyone it cannot dominate. That is the snake's head, which lifts itself up, and which the Lord tramples down to the ground, so that the snake travels on its belly and eats dirt, as the previous verse says.<br />This is how Isaiah describes the snake or dragon called Lucifer:{*1} Lucifer, you said in your heart, "I will scale the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God and sit on the mountain of assembly, on the flanks of the north.{*2} I will climb onto the loftiest parts of the cloud; I will become equal to the Highest One." Nevertheless, you will be thrown down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

That by the "head of the serpent" is meant the dominion of evil in general, and specifically of the love of self, is evident from its nature, which is so direful as not only to seek dominion, but even 
dominion over all things upon earth; nor does it rest satisfied with this, but aspires even to rule over everything in heaven, and then, not content with this, over the Lord himself, and even then it 
is not satisfied. This is latent in every spark of the love of self. If it were indulged, and freed from restraint, we should perceive that it would at once burst forth and would grow even to that aspiring 
height. Hence it is evident how the "serpent" or the evil of the love of self, desires to exercise dominion, and how much it hates all those who refuse its sway. This is that "head of the serpent" 
which exalts itself, and which the Lord "tramples down" even to the earth, that it may "go upon its belly, and eat dust" as stated in the verse immediately preceding. Thus also is described the "serpent" 
or "dragon" called "Lucifer" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     O Lucifer, thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit upon the mount of 
the congregation, in the sides of the north, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will be made equal to the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit (Isa. 
14:12-15).  The "serpent" or "dragon" is also described in the Revelation in regard to the way in which he exalts his head: </p>
<p>     A great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns, and many diadems 
upon his heads; but he was cast into the earth (Rev. 12:3, 9). In David: </p>
<p>     The saying of Jehovah to my Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool: Jehovah shall 
send the rod of thy strength out of Zion, He shall judge the nations, He hath filled with dead bodies, He hath bruised the head over much land; He shall drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall 
He lift up the head (Ps. 110:1-2, 6-7). </p>

'The head of the serpent' is used to mean the reign of evil in general and of self-love in particular. This becomes clear from its very nature, which seeks not merely to exercise dominion but also to 
exercise it over everything on earth. Yet it is not satisfied even with that, but seeks to rule over everything in heaven. Nor is it satisfied even then, but seeks to rule over the Lord. And even then 
it would not be content. This inclination lies concealed within every spark of self-love. If it were shown the slightest approval and the restraint on it were slackened, you would perceive it break 
out instantly and strive increasingly to achieve that end. From this it is clear how 'the serpent' or evil constituting self-love wishes to have dominion, and how it hates the person it is unable to dominate. 
This is 'the serpent's head' which rears itself and which the Lord treads on, right down to the ground so that it goes on its belly and eats dust, as described in the previous verse. The serpent 
or dragon called Lucifer is similarly described in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Lucifer, you said in your heart, I will go up the heavens, above the stars of God I will raise my throne, and I will sit on the mount 
of assembly, in the uttermost parts of the north. I will go up above the heights of the clouds, I will make myself equal to the Most High. But you will indeed be cast down to hell, to the sides of the 
pit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The serpent or dragon is also described in Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
A great fiery-red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads many jewels; but he was cast down to the 
earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:3,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:3, 9</a>.   
</blockquote>
This describes the height to which it raises its head. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies as Your foot-stool; Jehovah will 
send the rod of Your strength from Zion. He will judge the nations, He will fill them with corpses. He has crushed their head over much land. He will drink from the stream by the way, therefore He will 
lift up his head. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20110:1,%202,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 110:1, 2, 6, 7</a>.   
</blockquote>

Quod per 'caput serpentis' intelligatur dominium mali in genere, et amoris sui in specie, constare potest ex natura ejus, quae talis est ut non solum dominium quaerat sed etiam dominium super omnia 
terrae; nec sic acquiescit, sed super omnia caeli; nec sic quidem, sed super Dominum; et quidem nec tunc quiesceret; hoc latet in unaquavis scintilla amoris sui; si modo faveatur, et relaxaretur vinculum, 
percipies quod ilico rueret, et cresceret usque illuc: inde constat quomodo 'serpens,' seu malum amoris sui, dominari vult; et super quem dominari non potest, illum odit; hoc est 'caput serpentis' 
quod se extollit, et quod Dominus proculcat, et quidem usque ad terram ut ambulet super ventre et edat pulverem, sicut dicitur in versu mox praecedente.  Ita describitur serpens seu draco qui vocatur 
Lucifer, apud Esaiam, 	Lucifer, tu dixisti in corde tuo, caelos ascendam, super stellas Dei exaltabo thronum meum, et sedebo in monte conventus, in lateribus septentrionis; ascendam super excelsa nubis, 
par fiam Altissimo, verum tamen ad infernum dejectus eris, ad latera foveae, xiv 13-15: </p>
<p>serpens seu draco etiam describitur in Apocalypsi, 	Draco magnus rufus habens capita septem, et cornua decem, 
et super capitibus ejus diademata multa,... sed conjectus est 	in terram, xii 3, 9; </p>
<p>ubi quantum extollit caput, describitur: apud Davidem, 	Dictum Jehovae Domino Meo, Sede ad dextram Meam, usque 
dum posuero inimicos tuos scabellum pedibus tuis: sceptrum 	roboris tui mittet Jehovah e Zione,... judicabit gentes, implevit cadaveribus, contrivit caput super terram multam; e flumine in via bibet, 
propterea exaltabit caput, [Ps.] cx 1, 	2, 6, 7. </p>
