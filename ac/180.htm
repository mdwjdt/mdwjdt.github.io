<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第180节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>180.</strong>我苏醒以后，坐在头部的属天的天使一度陪伴着我，默默无言。从他们的思维语言里，我发现他们并不留意我的愚见，不仅不取笑，更是毫不在意。他们以思想说话，默默无声。他们在陪伴苏醒的灵魂时，即是这样与他们交流。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]180.</strong> The heavenly angels sitting at my head remained with me a while after I was "revived" without speaking except in their silent way. From their thought-speech I learned that they completely discounted all my misconceptions and falsities. It was not that they ridiculed them; they appeared not to care about them at all.<br />They speak by thoughts, without sound. This is the way they start to talk with the souls whom they accompany in the beginning. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 180</b></p><p><b>180.</b>
The celestial angels who sat at the head remained with me for some time after I was as it were resuscitated, but they conversed only tacitly. It was perceived from their cogitative speech that they made 
light of all fallacies and falsities, smiling at them not indeed as matters for derision, but as if they cared nothing about them. Their speech is cogitative, devoid of sound, and in this kind of 
language they begin to speak with the souls with whom they are at first present. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 180</b></p><p><b>180.</b>
The celestial angels who were sitting at my head were with me for a considerable time after I had so to speak been awakened. When they spoke they did not do so vocally. From their non-verbal expression 
of thought I perceived that they set all fallacies and falsities at nought, smiling at them indeed not as matters of derision but as if they were not at all interested in them. Their speech is thought 
that is not verbalized, and is the speech which they start to use with souls whom they are the first to be present with.  </p>

</p><b>180.</b>
Angeli caelestes qui capiti assidebant, postquam essem quasi resuscitatus, per aliquod tempus apud me fuerunt, nec locuti nisi tacite, id percipiens ex loquela eorum cogitativa quod nihili facerent 
omnes fallacias et falsitates, eas quidem non ut ludibria ridentes sed tanquam nihili curantes.  Loquela eorum est cogitativa absque sonoro, qua etiam incipiunt loqui cum animabus apud quos primum sunt. </p>
