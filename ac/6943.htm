<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6943节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6943.</strong>“摩西回答说”表出于神之律法的思维。这从“回答说”的含义和“摩西”的代表清楚可知。“回答说”是指思维。因为在文字的历史意义上用外在事物来表达的东西在内义上表示内在事物；天堂的属灵事物根本无法以其它方式呈现给世人。因为世人不理解赤裸的属灵事物，这些事物也无法用人类的语言来形容；这就是为何属灵事物通过相对应的属世事物来描述，以这种形式呈现给人类，由此使圣言既适合在自然界的人，也适合在灵界的人，天堂与人类因此建立起联系和友谊。“摩西”是指神的律法方面的主（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摩西回答说”表示出于神之律法的思维。出于神之律法的思维就是出于来自神性的真理的思维。此处的思维是，以色列人不会相信，除非他们看见神迹奇事。</p>

And Moses answered and said. That this signifies thought from the law Divine, is evident from the signification of "answering and saying," as being thought. For that which in the historical sense of 
the letter is expressed by external things, in the internal sense signifies internal things; because in no other way can the spiritual things of heaven be presented to men. For man does not apprehend 
bare spiritual things, neither can they be expressed in the words of human speech; and therefore spiritual things have been described by corresponding natural things, and in this way have been given to 
man. Thus the Word is helpful to man in the natural world, and also to man in the spiritual world, and hence there is communication of heaven with man, and communion. And from the representation of 
Moses, as being the Lord as to the law Divine (see n. 6752). Hence it is evident that by "Moses answered and said" is signified thought from the law Divine. Thought from the law Divine is from truth from 
the Divine; here that the sons of Israel will not believe unless they see signs and wonders. </p>

'And Moses answered and said' means thought coming from the law of God. This is clear from the meaning of 'answering and saying' as thought, for expressions used in the literal and historical sense to 
describe things of an external nature mean in the internal sense realities of an internal nature (spiritual realities, or things of heaven, cannot be presented to people in any other way at all, for 
bare spiritual realities cannot be comprehended by a person, nor can they be expressed in the words of human speech; that is why spiritual realities have been described by means of natural things corresponding 
to them and in that form presented to mankind, making the Word suited to a person in the natural world as well as to a person in the spiritual world, which establishes contact between heaven 
and mankind, and their fellowship); and from the representation of 'Moses' as the Lord in respect of the law of God, dealt with in <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>. From this it is evident that 'Moses answered and said' means 
thought coming from the law of God; and thought coming from the law of God is thought coming from the truth from God. Here the thought is that the children of Israel are not going to believe unless they 
see signs and portents. </p>

`Et respondit Moscheh, et dixit': quod significet cogitationem a lege Divina, constat ex significatione `respondere et dicere' quod sit cogitatio; quae enim in sensu litterae historico exprimuntur per 
externa, illa in sensu interno significant interna; {1} {2}nam spiritualia, quae caeli sunt, nusquam aliter possunt sisti hominibus; nam nuda spiritualia homo non capit, nec exprimi possunt vocibus 
loquelae humanae; quapropter spiritualia per correspondentia naturalia descripta sunt et sic data homini; ita Verbum conducit homini in naturali mundo, tum homini in spirituali mundo, inde communicatio 
caeli cum homine, et {3} communio {4}; et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Dominus quoad legem Divinam, de qua n. 6752; inde patet quod per `respondit Moscheh, et dixit' significetur cogitatio 
ex lege Divina; cogitatio ex lege Divina est ex vero a Divino; hic quod filii Israelis non credituri nisi videant signa et portenta. 	@1 i ita respondere et dicere, cogitationem, nam haec internum 
est, ex quo responsum et loquela, quae externa;$ 	@2 spiritualia enim$ 	@3 i inde$ 	@4 i bonorum$ </p>
