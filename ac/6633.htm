<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6633.</strong>由于仁之教义如今成了已失传的事物之一，并且信之教义由此大大远离真理，所以蒙主的神性怜悯，该教义有必要在出埃及记各章的前几节被呈现出来，从而重归教会。</p>

As the doctrine of charity is at this day one of the lost things, and as the doctrine of faith is consequently much alienated from the truth, this doctrine may of the Lord's Divine mercy be delivered 
before the several chapters of the Book of Exodus, and thus be restored to the church. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 1 </p>
<p>     1. And these are the names of the sons of Israel that came into Egypt with Jacob; a man 
and his house they came.      2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; </p>
<p>     3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; </p>
<p>     4. Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.      5. And all the souls that came out of the 
thigh of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt.      6. And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.      7. And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and were productive, 
and multiplied, and become very exceeding numerous; and the land was filled with them.      8. And there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.      9. And he said unto his people, Behold, 
the people of the sons of Israel are many and numerous more than we.      10. Come, let us use prudence with it,* peradventure it will be multiplied, and it will be that wars will happen, and it will 
also join itself to our enemies, and fight against us, and go up out of the land.      11. And they set over it princes of tributes, in order to afflict it with burdens. And it built cities of storehouses 
for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.      12. And as they afflicted it, so it was multiplied, and so it was increased. And they were moved with loathing because of the sons of Israel.      13. 
And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with cruelty: </p>
<p>     14. And they rendered their life bitter with grievous service, in clay, and in bricks, and in all service in the field, with all 
their service wherein they made them serve with cruelty.      15. And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other 
Puah; </p>
<p>     16. And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; and if it be a daughter, then she shall live.  
    17. And the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spoke to them, and they kept the boys alive.      18. And the king of Egypt called the midwives, and said to them, Wherefore do 
ye this word, and keep the boys alive?      19. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are living, and have brought forth before the midwife 
comes unto them.      20. And God did well to the midwives; and the people was multiplied and became very numerous.      21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made 
them houses.      22. And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every son that is born, ye shall cast him forth into the river, and every daughter ye shall keep alive. * The singular number is here 
used in both the Hebrew and the Latin. The same peculiar form is found also in the English Bible (Gen. 11:6),"Behold the people is one." </p>

Since teachings about charity are at the present day part of the things that have been lost and teachings about faith are as a consequence 'far removed from the truth, let teachings about charity in 
the Lord's Divine mercy be presented in the preliminary sections to chapters of the Book of Exodus and so be restored to the Church.  </p>

into the river, and every daughter you shall keep alive.  </p>

Quia doctrina charitatis hodie inter res deperditas est et inde doctrina fidei multum a vero abalienata, licet doctrinam illam, ex Divina Domini misericordia, ante singula capita Libri Exodi tradere, 
ac ita illam Ecclesiae restituere. {1} CAPUT I @1 i Exodi$   	1. Et haec nomina filiorum Israelis venientium Aegyptum cum Jacobo, vir et domus ejus venerunt. 	2. Reuben, Schimeon, Levi, et Jehudah. 	3. 
Jisaschar, Sebulun, et Benjamin. 4. Dan et Naphtali, Gad et Ascher.  	5. Et fuit omnis anima egressae femur Jacobi, septuaginta animae; et Joseph fuit in Aegypto. 	6. Et mortuus est Joseph, 
et omnes fratres ejus, et omnis generatio illa. 	7. Et filii Israelis fructificabantur et producebantur, et multiplicabantur et numerosi facti in valde valde, et impleta terra illis. 	8. Et surrexit 
rex novus super Aegyptum, qui non novit Josephum. 	9. Et dixit ad populum suum, Ecce populus filiorum Israelis multus et numerosus prae nobis. 	10. Age, prudentia utamur illi; forte multiplicabitur, 
et erit quod obveniant bella, et adjunget se etiam ille ad inimicos nostros, et pugnabit in nos; et ascendet e terra. 	11. Et posuerunt super illum principes tributorum, propter ut affligere illum 
oneribus; et aedificavit urbes promptuariorum Pharaoni, Pithom et Raamses. 	12. Et quemadmodum afflixerunt illum, ita multiplicabatur, et ita augebatur; et fastidio affecti propter filios Israelis. 	13. 
Et servire fecerunt Aegyptii filios Israelis in saevitia. 	14. Et amaram reddiderunt vitam illorum servitute gravi, in luto et in lateribus, et in omni servitio in agro, cum omni servitio illorum, 
quo servire fecerunt illos in saevitia. 	15. Et dixit rex Aegypti obstetricibus Hebraearum, quarum nomen unius Schiphra, et nomen alterius Puah. 	16. Et dixit, In obstetricando vos Hebraeis, et 
videritis super sellis, si filius ille, et occidetis illum, et si filia illa, et vivat. 	17. Et timebant obstetrices DEUM, et non fecerunt quemadmodum locutus ad (x)illas rex Aegypti, et vivificabant 
pueros. 	18. Et vocavit rex Aegypti obstetrices, et dixit illis, Quapropter facitis verbum istud, et vivificatis pueros? 	19. Et dicebant obstetrices ad Pharaonem, Quia non sicut mulieres (x)Aegyptiae, 
Hebraeae, quia viventes illae; antequam venit ad eas obstetrix, et pepererunt. 	20. Et benefecit DEUS obstetricibus, et multiplicabuntur populus, et numerosi facti valde. 	21. Et fuit, quia timuerunt 
obstetrices DEUM, et fecit illis domos. 	22. Et praecepit Pharao omni populo suo, (x)dicendo, Omnem filium qui nascitur, in flumen projicietis illum, et omnem filiam vivificetis. </p>
