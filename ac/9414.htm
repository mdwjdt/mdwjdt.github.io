<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9414节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9414.</strong>“耶和华对摩西说”表主对那些局限于外在意义之人的教导。这从“说”的含义和“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“说”当包括接下来构成教导的话时，是指教导（也可参看<a href="7186.htm">7186</a>，<a href="7241.htm">7241</a>，<a href="7267.htm">7267</a>，<a href="7304.htm">7304</a>，<a href="7380.htm">7380</a>，<a href="7517.htm">7517</a>，<a href="7769.htm">7769</a>，<a href="7793.htm">7793</a>，<a href="7825.htm">7825</a>，<a href="8041.htm">8041</a>节），教导来自主，因为在圣言中，“耶和华”表示主（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="1793.htm">1793</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="2018.htm">2018</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>，<a href="6281.htm">6281</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>，<a href="8864.htm">8864</a>，<a href="9315.htm">9315</a>节）；“摩西”是指在主和百姓之间充当媒介之物，因而是指在其外在神圣方面的圣言，因为这圣言充当媒介之物。摩西现在开始代表这个媒介，这一点从接下来的整个思路明显看出来。因为这百姓局限于圣言的外在或外层，结果，他们的敬拜是外在的，与任何内在事物分离（<a href="9380.htm">9380</a>节）。像这样的人根本不可能与主有任何神圣的联系，更不用与祂结合了，除非通过一个媒介。下文（<a href="9419.htm">9419</a>节）将详细解释这个问题。<br />这百姓局限于脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义，结果他们的敬拜同样是外在的，这一点从接下来的事件很明显地看出来。因为四十天之后，他们完全背弃了，去敬拜金牛犊而不是耶和华。也由于这个原因，那时摩西将石版从手中扔下来，摔碎了；后来他被吩咐另凿出两块石版，在上面再写上那些话；以此表示这百姓完全不愿领受来自诸如存在于天上的圣言的内在意义的任何教义，只愿意接受来自脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义，就是诸如当今在世上仍存在于他们中间的那种圣言的教义。这也解释了为何这百姓不再被称为“耶和华的百姓”，而是被称为“摩西的百姓”，如下列经文：<br />耶和华对摩西说，走，下去吧！因为你的百姓，就是你使他们从埃及地上来的，已经败坏了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.7.htm">32:7</a>）<br /><br />耶和华对摩西说，去吧！你和百姓，就是你使他们从埃及地上来的，从这里上去。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.1.htm">33:1</a>）<br />也正因这个原因，后来他们从那山上被清除：<br />任何人都不可和你一同上来，整座山都不可见到人，在山前也不可叫羊群牛群吃草。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.3.htm">34:3</a>）<br />因为“西乃山”表示律法，或神性真理和圣言，就是诸如存在于天上的那种，因而也表示天堂（<a href="8399.htm">8399</a>，<a href="8753.htm">8753</a>，<a href="8793.htm">8793</a>，<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）。摩西以前之所以代表总体上，也就是其内在意义和外在意义上的圣言，是因为那里所论述的主题是律法的颁布，律法的颁布表示总体上神性真理的揭示。这是揭示的开始，因为圣言中的其它一切内容都是后来写下的。</p>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies instruction from the Lord for those who are in the external sense, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being instruction, when it involves 
the things which follow and give instruction (see also n. 7186, 7241, 7267, 7304, 7380, 7517, 7769, 7793, 7825, 8041); that it is from the Lord is because by "Jehovah" in the Word is meant the Lord 
(see n. 1343, 1736, 1793, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6280, 6281, 6303, 6905, 8274, 8864, 9315); and from the representation of Moses, as being that which mediates between the Lord 
and the people, thus the Word in respect to its holy external, for this is what mediates. That Moses now begins to have this representation, is evident from the series of what follows. For that people 
was in the external of the Word, and from this in the external of worship separate from what is internal (n. 9380). They who are of such a character cannot possibly have holy communication with the 
Lord, still less conjunction, except through an intermediate. How the case is in regard to this, will be unfolded more fully below (n. 9419).  [2] That this people was in the external sense of the Word 
separate from the internal, and consequently in the like worship, is very manifest from what follows. For after forty days they fell back altogether and worshiped a golden calf instead of Jehovah. 
Wherefore also Moses then cast away the tables out of his hand, and broke them; and afterward he was commanded to hew out other tables, upon which the same words should be written. By this was signified 
that this people was by no means willing to acknowledge any doctrinal thing from the internal sense of the Word, such as there is in heaven; but only from its external sense separate from the internal, 
such as is even at this day among them. Wherefore also that people was no longer called the "people of Jehovah," but the "people of Moses," as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah spoke unto 
Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou madest to come up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves (Exod. 32:7).      Jehovah spoke unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and 
the people which thou hast made to come up out of the land of Egypt (Exod. 33:1). On this account also they were afterward removed from the mountain: "No man shall come up with thee, and also no man 
shall be seen in the whole mountain; and no flock or herd shall feed over against this mountain" (Exod. 34:3); for by "Mount Sinai" is signified the law, or Divine truth, and the Word, such as it is in 
heaven; thus also heaven (n. 8399, 8753, 8793, 8805). The reason why Moses previously represented the Word in general, that is, both as to its internal sense and as to its external sense, was that the 
subject there treated of was the promulgation of the law, which signified the revelation of Divine truth in general; for it was the beginning of revelation, seeing that everything else in the Word 
was written afterward. </p>

'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instructions from the Lord for those restricted to the outward sense. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as instructions, when it includes the things stated 
after it that make up the instructions, as also in <a href="7186.htm">7186</a>, <a href="7241.htm">7241</a>, <a href="7267.htm">7267</a>, <a href="7304.htm">7304</a>, <a href="7380.htm">7380</a>, <a href="7517.htm">7517</a>, <a href="7769.htm">7769</a>, <a href="7793.htm">7793</a>, <a href="7825.htm">7825</a>, <a href="8041.htm">8041</a> (the instructions come from the Lord because 'Jehovah' is used in the Word to mean the Lord, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="1793.htm">1793</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="2018.htm">2018</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, <a href="8864.htm">8864</a>, <a href="9315.htm">9315</a>); and from the representation of 'Moses' as that which acts as the intermediary between the 
Lord and the people, thus the Word in respect of its outward holiness since this acts as an intermediary. The fact that 'Moses' begins now to represent this intermediary is clear from the train of thought 
in all that follows. For that people was restricted to the external level of the Word, and as a consequence their worship was external, separated from anything internal, see <a href="9380.htm">9380</a>. Those who are 
like this cannot have any holy contact at all with the Lord, let alone be joined to Him, except through an intermediary. This matter will be explained more fully below in <a href="9419.htm">9419</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 
this people was restricted to the outward sense of the Word, separated from the inward, and that as a consequence their worship was similarly external, is plainly evident from events that followed. After 
forty days they fell completely away, worshipping the golden calf instead of Jehovah. Also, because of this Moses at that time threw the tablets from his hand and smashed them; and afterwards he was 
commanded to hew some other tablets on which the same words would be written. The meaning of this was that this people were altogether unwilling to accept any teaching at all from the inward sense 
of the Word as it exists in heaven, only from its outward sense separated from the inward, as the Word exists with them in the world even at the present day. This also explains why that people were no 
longer called Jehovah's people but Moses' people, as in Chapter <a href="32.htm">32</a> further on,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go! go down; for your people whom you caused to come up from the land of Egypt have corrupted 
themselves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Chapter <a href="33.htm">33</a>,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go! go up from here, you and the people whom you have caused to come up from the land of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2033:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 33:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>For this reason 
also they were subsequently removed from the mountain. And in Chapter <a href="34.htm">34</a>,  </p>
<blockquote>
No man shall come up with you, and also no man shall be seen on all the mountain. Also no flock or herd shall feed before 
this mountain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>For 'Mount Sinai' means the Law or Divine Truth and the Word as it exists in heaven, and so heaven as well, <a href="8399.htm">8399</a>, <a href="8753.htm">8753</a>, <a href="8793.htm">8793</a>, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>. The reason why Moses previously 
represented the Word in general, that is, in respect both of its inward sense and of its outward sense, was that there the subject was the declaring of the Law, by which the revelation of Divine Truth 
in general was meant. This was the beginning of the revelation, for all else in the Word was written later.  </p>
