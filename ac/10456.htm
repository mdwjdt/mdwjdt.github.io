<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10456节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10456</strong>.“摩西说，这不是打胜仗叫喊的噪音，也不是打败仗的噪音”表天堂从这一边行动，地狱从那一边行动，因而虚假反对真理，真理反对虚假。这从“喊叫的噪音”和“不是打胜仗，也不是打败仗”的含义清楚可知：“喊叫的噪音”或“呼喊的噪音”是指这个民族的内层的性质（参看<a href="10454.htm">10454</a>节）；“不是打胜仗，也不是打败仗”是指虚假与真理之间的争战的不确定性，没有结果。由于一切虚假皆来自地狱，一切真理皆来自天堂，所以这句话表示天堂从这一边行动，地狱从那一边行动。“喊叫”表示虚假（参看<a href="2240.htm">2240</a>节），还表示充满行动意图的思维（<a href="7119.htm">7119</a>节），又表示深深的悲伤（<a href="7782.htm">7782</a>节）。这句话在此描述了这个民族内层的状态，就是当与他们同在的地狱反对天堂，天堂反对地狱时，因而当他们夹在这二者之间时他们所处的状态，这就是当他们因内在关闭而进行外在敬拜时所发生的情形。他们的内在被关闭是为了通过外在仪式，也就是更内在事物的代表能有一个与天堂的联系，前面论述过这个主题。</p>

And he said, It is not the voice of a cry for victory, neither is it the voice of a cry for being overcome. That this signifies heaven acting on the one side and hell on the other, thus falsity against 
truth and truth against falsity, is evident from the signification of "the voice of a cry," or of "the voice in shouting," as being the quality of the interiors of that nation (see above, n. 10454); 
and from the signification of "not for victory, and not for being overcome," as being the hanging of the combat between falsity and truth, and no decision. And whereas all falsity is from hell, and 
all truth is from heaven, by the same words is signified that heaven acts on one side and hell on the other. (That a "cry" denotes falsity, see n. 2240; that it denotes thought with the full intention 
of acting, n. 7119; and that it denotes interior lamentation, n. 7782.) By these words is described the state of the interiors of that nation, in which they are when hell acts with them against heaven, 
and heaven against hell, thus when they are held between the two, which was the case when they were in external worship while their internal was closed. The latter was closed to the intent that nevertheless 
there might be a communication with heaven by means of external things, which were representative of interior ones, which subject has been treated of above. </p>

'And he said, It is not the noise of the cry in victory, and it is not the noise of the cry in defeat' means heaven acting from one side and hell from the other, thus falsity acting against truth, and 
truth against falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'the noise of the cry', or the noise of shouting, as the essential nature of that nation's interiors, dealt with above in <a href="10454.htm">10454</a>; from the meaning 
of 'neither victory nor defeat' as the indecisive nature of the conflict between falsity and evil and its failure to be resolved. And since all falsity comes from hell and truth from heaven the same 
words serve to mean that heaven acts from one side and hell from the other. ('Cry' means falsity, see <a href="2240.htm">2240</a>, also thought with full intention to act, <a href="7119.htm">7119</a>, and deep grief, <a href="7782.htm">7782</a>.) The words used here 
describe the condition of that nation's interiors when hell with them acts against heaven, and heaven acts against hell, thus when they are held between the two, as happened when with their internal 
closed they were engaged in an outward act of worship. Their internal was closed in order that through outward observances, which were representative of more internal things, there might be contact with 
heaven, a subject that has been dealt with above.  </p>

`Et dixit, Non vox clamoris victoria, et non vox clamoris res perdita': quod significet ab una parte caelum agere, ab altera infernum, ita falsum contra verum, ac verum contra falsum, constat (c)a significatione 
`vocis clamoris,' seu vocis in vociferatione, quod sit quale interiorum illius gentis, de qua supra n. 10,454; ex significatione `non {1}victoria et non res perdita' quod sit pendentia pugnae 
inter falsum et verum, et non decisio; et quia omne falsum est ab inferno, ac verum e caelo, per eadem verba significatur (d)quod caelum ab una parte {2}agat et infernum ab altera; quod `clamor' 
sit falsum, videatur n. 2240, {3}quod sit cogitatio cum plena intentione faciendi, n. 7119, et quod sit lamentatio interior, n. 7782. Per haec describitur status interiorum illius gentis in quo sunt 
quando infernum apud illos agit contra caelum, ac caelum agit contra infernum, ita cum inter utrumque tenentur, quod factum est quando in cultu externo erant, clauso interno; quod claudebatur ob causam 
ut usque per externa, quae erant (x)repraesentativa interiorum, esset communicatio cum caelo; de qua re supra actum est. @1 victoriae, et non rei perditae$ @2 agere$ @3 i et$ </p>
