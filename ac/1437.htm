<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1437节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1437.</strong>“都出来往迦南地去”表祂以这种方式逐渐接近爱的属天事物。这从“迦南地”的含义清楚可知。“迦南地”代表主在天上和地上的国，这从圣言中的很多事物明显可知。原因在于，代表性教会就是在那地建立的，其中一切事物，无论总体还是细节，都代表主和其国度的属天、属灵之物。不仅仪式具有代表性，而且与之相关的一切，包括执行仪式的人，借以执行仪式的事物，以及举行仪式的地方，都具有代表性。由于代表性教会在那里，故这地被称为圣地，尽管它并不神圣，因为居住在那里的人是偶像崇拜者和亵渎者。这就是为何在此处以及下文中，“迦南地”表示爱的属天事物的原因。事实上，爱的属天事物，也唯独这些事物存在于主的国度，并构成祂的王国。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1437.</strong> The meaning of they left to go into the land of Canaan as the fact that by these means he would press on all the way to the heavenly aspects of love can be seen from the symbolism of the land of Canaan. The land of Canaan represents the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth, as the Word reveals in many places.{*1} The reason for the connection is that the land of Canaan saw the establishment of the representative church, in which everything in general and particular represented the Lord and the heavenly and spiritual elements of his kingdom. It was not just their rituals that had a representative meaning but everything connected with ritual as well 钬?the people who ministered, the tools of their ministry, and the places where they carried it out. Because the representative church was there, the land was called the Holy Land, even though it was anything but holy, since profane idolaters lived there. This, then, is why the land of Canaan here and in what follows symbolizes the heavenly qualities of love. The heavenly qualities of love are all that the Lord's kingdom contains and all that it comprises.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's treatment of Canaan, see note 2 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1437/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1413" target=_top>1413</a>.

And they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. That this signifies that He thus advanced to the celestial things of love, is evident from the signification of "the land of Canaan." That the land 
of Canaan represents the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth, is evident from many things in the Word. The reason is that the Representative Church was instituted there, in which all things both 
in general and in particular represented the Lord and the celestial and spiritual things of His kingdom. Not only were the rites representative, but everything connected with them, as well the persons 
who ministered, as the things by which they ministered, and also the places of the ministration. As the Representative Church was there, the land was called the Holy Land, although it was anything 
but holy, for it was inhabited by the idolatrous and the profane. This then is the reason why by "the land of Canaan," here and in what follows, are signified the celestial things of love; for the celestial 
things of love, and these alone, are in the Lord's kingdom, and constitute His Kingdom. </p>

'They came out to go into the land of Canaan' means that in this manner He drew closer to the celestial things of love. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan'. That 'the land of Canaan' 
represents the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth becomes clear from many things in the Word. The reason it does so is that the representative Church was established in that land, a Church in which 
every single thing represented the Lord and the celestial and spiritual things of His kingdom. This applied not only to religious observances but also to everything associated with those observances 
- to both the persons who ministered and to the things they administered, and even to the places where the ministrations took place because the representative Church was centred there the land was 
consequently called 'the Holy Land', even though it was anything but holy, seeing that idolaters and profaners inhabited it. This then is the reason why 'the land of Canaan' here and in what follows means 
the celestial things of love Indeed the celestial things of love, these alone, exist in the Lord's kingdom and constitute that kingdom </p>

</p><b>1437.</b>
Quod 'exiverunt ad eundum in terram Canaan' significet quod ita pergeret ad caelestia amoris, constat a significatione 'terrae Canaanis'; quod terra Canaan repraesentet regnum Domini in caelis et in 
terris, ex multis in Verbo constare potest; causa est quia ibi Ecclesia repraesentativa instituta est, in qua omnia et singula repraesentabant Dominum et Ipsius regni caelestia et spiritualia; nec solum 
ritus sed etiam omnia quae adjuncta ritibus, tam qui ministrabant quam per quae ministrabantur, etiam loca ubi ministratio; quia Ecclesia repraesentativa ibi, terra inde appellata fuit 'Terra Sancta,' 
tametsi nihil minus quam sancta fuit, quippe habitata ab idololatris et profanis; haec nunc causa est quod per 'terram Canaan' hic et in sequentibus significentur caelestia amoris; caelestia enim 
amoris sunt unice quae sunt in regno Domini et quae constituunt regnum Domini. </p>
