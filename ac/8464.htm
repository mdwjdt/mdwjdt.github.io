<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8464节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8464.</strong>“这就是耶和华给你们吃的食物”表这就是那必变成他们自己的，并构成他们生命的良善，在至高意义上表这就是在你们里面的主。这从“食物”的含义清楚可知，“食物”是指属天和属灵的良善，在至高意义上是指主（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节），在此是指属灵良善，也就是属灵教会成员的良善，即真理之良善，如刚才所述（<a href="8458.htm">8458</a>节）。由于这食物是吗哪，故可知，“吗哪”表示该良善。这一点从31节对它的描述也明显看出来：它像芫荽的种子，白色，味道如同蜜饼；同样从民数记对它的描述明显看出来：<br />这吗哪仿佛芫荽的种子，它的样子好像珍珠的样子。他们或用磨推，或用臼捣，煮在锅中，又作成糕饼，滋味好像新油的滋味。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民11.7.htm">11:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民11.8.htm">8</a>）<br />从这些细节明显可知，“吗哪”在灵义上表示真理之良善，也就是属灵教会的良善。也正因如此，在诗篇，它被称为“天上的粮食”：<br />祂却从上面吩咐天空，又敞开天上的门，使吗哪如雨般降与他们，将天上的粮食赐给他们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.23.htm">78:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.24.htm">24</a>）<br />“粮食”是指真理之良善（参看<a href="5295.htm">5295</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>节）。在启示录，“吗哪”还表示被赐予那些经历试探并得胜之人的真理之良善：<br />得胜的，我必将那隐藏的吗哪赐给他吃，并赐他一块白石。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.17.htm">2:17</a>）<br />“吗哪”在至高意义上是指我们里面的主，这一点从主在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：<br />你们的祖宗在旷野吃过吗哪，还是死了。这是从天上降下来的食物，叫人吃了就不死。我是从天上降下来生命的食物；人若吃这食物，就必永远活着。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.49.htm">6:49</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.51.htm">51</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.58.htm">58</a>）<br />由此明显可知，“吗哪”在至高意义上表示主。原因在于，“吗哪”是指真理之良善，一切良善皆来自主，因此主在良善里面，就是良善本身。“吃”表示这良善将要变成他们自己的，并构成他们的生命（<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节）；因为来自主的良善给人带来天堂的生命，并且自此以后滋养并维持它。</p>

This is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat. That this signifies that this is the good which must be appropriated and make their life, in the supreme sense that this is the Lord in you, is 
evident from the signification of "bread," as being good celestial and spiritual, and in the supreme sense, as being the Lord (see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 
5915), here spiritual good, that is, the good of the man of the spiritual church, which is the good of truth (of which just above, n. 8458). As this bread was the manna, it follows that by "the manna" 
is signified this good; which is also apparent from the description of it in the thirty-first verse: </p>
<p>     It was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it like that of a cake in honey; </p>
<p>and 
likewise from the description of it in Numbers: </p>
<p>     The manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium; they ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and 
boiled it in a pot, and made cakes of it: the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil (11:7, 8). From these particulars it is plain that in the spiritual sense "the manna" denotes the good of truth, 
that is, the good of the spiritual church. Hence also it is called "the grain of the heavens," in David: </p>
<p>     He commanded the skies from above, and opened the doors of the heavens, and made manna 
to rain down upon them, and gave them the grain of the heavens (Ps. 78:23, 24). (That "grain" denotes the good of truth, see n. 5295, 5410.) "Manna" also denotes the good of truth which is given to 
those who undergo temptations and conquer, in John: </p>
<p>     To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone (Rev. 2:17). That in the supreme sense "the 
manna" denotes the Lord in us, is evident from the very words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     Your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and are dead: this is the bread which cometh down from heaven, 
that one may eat thereof and not die: I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eat of this bread he shall live eternally (6:49-51, 58). From all this it is very plain that by "the 
manna" in the supreme sense is signified the Lord. The reason is that "the manna" denotes the good of truth, and all good is from the Lord, and consequently the Lord is in good, and is the good itself. 
That this good will be appropriated to them and make their life, is signified by "eating" (n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 4745); for the good which is from the Lord makes the life of heaven with man, and 
thereafter nourishes and sustains it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8464</b></p><p><b>8464.</b>
'It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat' means that this is the good that will become their own and constitute their life, in the highest sense that this is the Lord within you. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'bread' as celestial and spiritual good, and in the highest sense as the Lord, dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>, at this 
point spiritual good, that is, good as it exists with a member of the spiritual Church, which is the good of truth, dealt with just above in <a href="8458.htm">8458</a>. Since that bread was the manna it follows that this 
good is meant by 'the manna'. This is also made plain by the description of it in verse 31 of the present chapter, which says 'it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like that of a cake 
with honey', as well as from the description of it in Numbers <a href="11.htm">11</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
The man[na] was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium. They ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, 
and cooked it in a pan, and made cakes out of it; and its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2011:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 11:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From the details given here it is evident that 'manna' in the spiritual sense means 
the good of truth, that is, good as it exists with the spiritual Church. They also explain why it is called 'the grain of the heavens' in David, </p>
<blockquote>
He commanded the skies from above, and threw open 
the doors of the heavens. And He caused man[na] to rain down onto them, and gave them the grain of the heavens. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The grain' is the good of truth, see <a href="5295.htm">5295</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>. 'Manna' again stands 
for the good of truth, which is given to those who undergo temptations and overcome in them, in John, </p>
<blockquote>
He who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a 
white pebble. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%202:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 2:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that 'manna' in the highest sense is the Lord within us is clear from actual words used by the Lord in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and 
they died. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that anyone eating of it may not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:49-51,%2058&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:49-51, 58</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is clearly evident that 'the manna' in the highest sense means the Lord. The reason why is that 'manna' is the good of truth; but all good comes from the Lord, 
so that the Lord is within good and is Himself that good. </p>
<p>As regards that good, that this will become their own and constitute their life, this is meant by 'eating', <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a>, <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>; for good 
which comes from the Lord brings the life of heaven to a person, and from then on nourishes and sustains it.

`(x)Hoc panis quem dedit Jehovah vobis ad edendum': quod significet quod hoc bonum quod appropriabitur et faciet vitam illorum, in supremo sensu quod hoc {1}sit Dominus in vobis, constat ex significatione 
`panis' quod sit bonum caeleste et spirituale, et in supremo sensu quod sit Dominus, de qua n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915, hic bonum spirituale, 
hoc est, bonum hominis Ecclesiae spiritualis, quod est bonum veri, de quo mox supra n. 8458; quia panis ille erat manna, {2}sequitur quod per `mannam' {3}significetur id bonum; quod etiam {4}elucet ex 
descriptione ejus in vers. 31 hujus capitis quod {5} esset `sicut semen coriandri album, et sapor ejus sicut placentae in melle'; {6}et quoque ex descriptione ejus Num. xi, Man erat sicut semen coriandri, 
et species ejus sicut species (x)bdellii: moluerunt molis, aut contuderunt in mortario, et coxerunt in cacabo, et fecerunt ex eo placentas; sapor ejus erat sicut sapor suci olei, vers. 7, 8; </p>
<p>ex 
{7}singulis ibi patet quod `manna' in sensu spirituali sit bonum veri, hoc est, bonum {8} Ecclesiae spiritualis; {9}inde etiam vocatur `frumentum caelorum' apud Davidem, Praecepit aetheribus desuper, 
et ostia caelorum patefecit, et depluere fecit super illos man, et frumentum caelorum dedit illis, Ps. lxxviii [23,] 24 [A.V. 22, 23]; </p>
<p>`frumentum' quod sit bonum veri, videatur n. 5295, 5410: `manna' 
etiam pro bono veri, quod datur illis qui tentationes subeunt et vincunt, apud Johannem, Qui vincit, illi dabo ut comedat de manna abscondito, et dabo illi calculum album, Apoc. ii 17. Quod `manna' 
in supremo sensu sit Dominus in nobis, constat ex ipsis Domini verbis apud Johannem, Patres vestri comederunt mannam in deserto, et mortui sunt; hic est panis qui e caelo descendit, ut quis ex eo 
comedat non moriatur; Ego sum panis {10}vivus qui e caelo descendit; si quis {11}comedit ex hoc pane vivet in aeternum, vi 49-51, 58; </p>
<p>ex his manifeste patet quod per `mannam' in supremo sensu significetur 
Dominus; {12}causa est quia manna est bonum veri, et omne bonum est a Domino, et inde Dominus est in bono, estque ipsum bonum.  Quod bonum illud iis appropriabitur et faciet vitam illorum, significatur 
per `edere,' n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 4745; bonum enim quod a Domino, facit vitam caeli apud hominem, ac deinceps nutrit ac sustentat illam. 	1 See n. 8450, note 2 	2 constat 	3 significatur 	4 
patet a 	5 i nempe 	6 per semen coriandri album significatur verum quod inibi esset ita purum, et per saporem sicut placentae in melle, significatur bonum quod jucundum, sicut quod ex vero per jucundum 
factum bonum, etiam a,  cp n. 8511 	7 quibus 	8 i quod homini 	9 ideo 	10 vivens 	11 comederit 	12 quia per illam significatur bonum quod Ecclesiae spiritualis: bonum enim illud est a Domino, 
et inde Dominus est in bono, et est ipsum bonum; quod significetur quod bonum illud eis appropriabitur, et faciet vitam illorum, constat ex eo, quod bonum sit quod facit vitam coeli, nam quod facit 
et dein nutrit et sustentat hanc vitam est bonum et verum a Domino, appropriatio ut fiat vitae </p>
