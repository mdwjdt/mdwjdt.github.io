<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>747.</strong>“一对一对”表互补之物。对此，人皆从它们成双成对的事实清楚明了。它们若非象真理与良善，或邪恶与虚假那样彼此互补，不可能成双成对。因为一切事物都有一个如真理与良善那样的婚姻，或一个如邪恶与虚假那样的苟合，因为觉知与意愿，或觉知之物与意愿之物之间有一个婚姻。实际上，一切事物都有其婚姻或苟和，否则，它不可能生存下去。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]747.</strong> Anyone can see the symbolism of two each, two each, as elements that answer to each other, by considering that such things are pairs. They cannot be pairs unless they answer to each other as do truth and goodness, and evil and falsity. All things display something like a marriage or coupling within them, like the match of truth with goodness or of evil with falsity, because the intellect is married to the will. To put it another way, ideas in the intellect are married to the intentions of the will. In fact everything has its partner or mate, without which it could never remain in existence. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 747</b></p><p><b>747.</b>
That "two and two" signify things that correspond, anyone may see from their being pairs; they cannot be pairs unless they correspond to each other, as do goods and truths, and evils and falsities. For 
there is in all things a semblance of a marriage, or a coupling, as of truths with goods, and of evils with falsities, because there is a marriage of the understanding with the will, or of the things 
of the understanding with those of the will. And indeed everything has its marriage or its coupling, without which it could not possibly subsist. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 747</b></p><p><b>747.</b>
'Two and two' means complementary things. This may become clear to anyone from the fact that they are pairs. It is impossible for them to be pairs unless they are complementary to one another as truths 
and goods are, or evils and falsities. In fact all things contain the likeness of a marriage or a coupling together, as in the case of truths to goods, or of evils to falsities, because of the marriage 
of the understanding to the will, or of things of the understanding to those of the will. Indeed everything contains a marriage or coupling together of its own on which its very continuance depends. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 747</b>
</p><b>747.</b>
Quod 'bina bina' significent correspondentia, constare cuivis potest ex eo quod sint paria; paria non possunt esse nisi sibi correspondeant, sicut sibi vera et bona, mala et falsa; omnium enim est conjugii 
instar, seu copulatio, ut verorum cum bonis, et malorum cum falsis, quia est conjugium intellectus cum voluntate, seu intellectualium cum voluntariis, et quidem unicuivis rei suum est conjugium, 
seu sua copulatio, absque qua nusquam subsistit. </p>
