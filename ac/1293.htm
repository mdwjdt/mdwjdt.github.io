<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1293节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1293.</strong>“就居住在那里”表（由此导致的）他们的生活。这从圣言中“居住”的含义清楚看出来，“居住”就是生活。“居住”这个词经常出现在圣言的预言和历史部分，从内义上说，它通常指生活。原因在于，上古之人住在帐篷中，并在里面举行最神圣的敬拜，故在圣言中，“帐篷”表敬拜中的圣洁，如前所述（<a href="414.htm">414</a>节）。由于“帐篷”表敬拜的圣洁，所以“居住”的正面意义也表生活或生命。同样，正因上古之人随帐篷迁移，故在圣言的内义上，“迁移”表生活的模式和秩序。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1293.</strong> The symbolism of and they settled there as the way they consequently lived can be seen from the symbolism of settling, in the Word, as living. The word settle, or reside, occurs many times in both the prophetic and narrative books of the Word, and on an inner level it usually symbolizes living one's life. The reason for the symbolism is that the earliest people lived in tents and carried out their holiest devotions there. So tents in the Word also symbolize the holiness of worship, as shown in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1293/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414" target=_top>414</a>. And since tents symbolized the holiness in worship, settling or residing (in its good sense) also symbolizes life, or the way one lives.<br />Because the earliest people took their tents with them when they set out on a journey, setting out in the Word's inner sense also symbolizes the customs and pattern of a life. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1293</b></p><p><b>1293.</b>
And they dwelt there. That this signifies the derivative life, may be seen from the signification in the Word of "dwelling," which is living. The word "dwell" frequently occurs in both the prophetic 
and the historic parts of the Word, and in the internal sense it usually signifies to live. The reason is that the most ancient people dwelt in tents, and held their most holy worship there; and therefore 
in the Word "tents" signify what is holy in worship, as before shown (n. 414). And as tents signified the holy in worship, "to dwell," also, in a good sense, signifies to live, or life. In like manner, 
because the most ancient people journeyed with their tents, in the internal sense of the Word "to journey" signifies the modes and order of life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1293</b></p><p><b>1293.</b>
'And they dwelt there' means the life that resulted. This becomes clear from the meaning in the Word of 'dwelling' as living. The expression to dwell occurs many times in both the prophetical and the 
historical sections of the Word, and in the internal sense it as a rule means to live. The reason is that the most ancient people dwelt in tents and celebrated their most holy worship in them, and this 
also is why 'tents' in the Word means the holiness of worship, as shown in <a href="414.htm">414</a>. And since 'tents' meant the holiness within worship, 'dwelling' in a good sense also means living, or life. In a similar 
way it is because the most ancient people travelled around with their tents that 'travelling' in the internal sense of the Word means the established patterns and order of life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1293</b>
</p><b>1293.</b>
'Et habitarunt ibi': quod significet vitam inde, constare potest a significatione 'habitare' in Verbo quod sit vivere; vox habitare tam in propheticis quam in historicis Verbi multoties occurrit et 
ut plurimum in sensu interno significat vivere; causa est quod antiquissimi habitaverint in tentoriis, et ibi cultum sanctissimum habuerint, quare etiam 'tentoria' in Verbo significant sanctum cultus, 
ut ostensum n. 414; et quoniam 'tentoria' significabant sanctum in cultu, etiam 'habitare' in bono sensu significat vivere seu vitam: similiter quia profecti sunt antiquissimi cum suis tentoriis, 'proficisci' 
in sensu interno Verbi significat vitae instituta et ordinem. </p>
