<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第770节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>770.</strong>“挪亚的妻子”表教会本身，与他们一起的“他的三个儿媳”表衍生的众教会本身。这一点从前面所述清楚可知，也就是说，当教会成员被提及名字时，就表示教会的全部，或如它被称谓的，是教会之首。在这种情况下，“妻子”就是教会，如前所述（<a href="252.htm">252</a>，<a href="253.htm">253</a>节）。当圣言中提及“男人与妻子”，或“一公一母”时，情况则不同。在这种情况下，“男人”和“公”表觉知之物，也就是主之真理，而“妻子”和“母”表意愿之物，也就是信之良善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]770.</strong> The symbolism of Noah's wife as the actual church and of his sons' three wives with them as the actual churches that developed out of that church can be seen from what was just said. The statement was that when the person of the church is mentioned by name, it means the all-in-all of the church or, as the expression goes, the head of the church.{*1} A wife is then the church, as shown earlier (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_770/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_252" target=_top>252</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_770/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_253" target=_top>253</a>).<br />Things are otherwise when the Word refers to either man and wife or male and female. The man or male then symbolizes intellectual concerns, or the truth that faith embraces, and the wife or female symbolizes the concerns of the will, or the good that faith urges.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The "head of the church" is an expression used in the Epistles to refer to Christ; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_770/bible_king-james-version_ephesians_1_22-23" target=_top>Ephesians 1:22-23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_770/bible_king-james-version_ephesians_5_23" target=_top>5:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_770/bible_king-james-version_colossians_1_18" target=_top>Colossians 1:18</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 770</b></p><p><b>770.</b>
That by Noah's "wife" is signified the church itself, and by the "three wives of his sons with them" the churches themselves that were derived from that church, is evident from what has been said before, 
namely, that when the man of the church is named, the all of the church is meant, or, as it is termed, the head of the church; and then his "wife" is the church itself, as shown before (n. 252, 253). 
It is otherwise when "man and wife" or "male and female" are named in the Word, for then by "man" and "male" are signified the things of the understanding, or the truths of faith; and by "wife" and 
"female" the things of the will, or the goods of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 770</b></p><p><b>770.</b>
'Noah's wife' means the Church itself, and 'the three wives of his sons with them' the derivative Churches themselves. This is clear from what has been stated, that is to say, when the member of the 
Church is mentioned by name, the all of the Church is meant, or as it is called, the head of the Church. 'Wife' in that case is the Church, as shown already in <a href="252.htm">252</a>, <a href="253.htm">253</a> It is different when 'man and wife' 
or 'male and female' are mentioned in the Word. In that case 'man' and 'male' mean things of the understanding, which are the truths of faith, while 'wife' and 'female' mean things of the will, which 
are the goods of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 770</b>
</p><b>770.</b>
Quod per 'uxorem Noahi' significetur ipsa Ecclesia, et per 'tres uxores filiorum ejus cum illis' ipsae Ecclesiae inde, constat ex illis quae dicta sunt, nempe, cum homo Ecclesiae nominatur, quod sit 
omne Ecclesiae seu, ut appellatur, caput Ecclesiae; et tunc 'uxor' est Ecclesia, sicut prius ostensum, n. 252, 253; aliter cum in Verbo, vir et uxor, aut masculus et femina, tunc per 'virum et masculum' 
significantur intellectualia, seu vera fidei, et per 'uxorem et feminam' voluntaria, seu bona fidei. </p>
