<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4949节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4949.</strong>有相当多的人在脚底下有住所，我偶尔与他们交谈过。我曾看见他们当中有一些人试图从那里爬上来，也蒙允许感受他们的这种努力。他们甚至爬上我的膝盖，但又沉了下去。当有人渴望从自己的居所爬到更高的地方时，这种渴望便以这种方式被呈现给身体感官，如此处所描述的那些渴望上到膝盖和大腿区域之人的居所之人。我被告知，他们就是那种与自己相比，看不起别人的人，这也是为何他们渴望从他们所在的地方起来的原因，不仅通过脚上到大腿，而且若有可能，还要上到头顶之上。尽管如此，他们还是沉了下去。从某种程度上说，他们很愚蠢，因为这种傲慢会扑灭并窒息天堂之光，因而扑灭并窒息聪明。这就解释了为何围绕他们的气场看上去就像一层厚厚的渣滓。</p>

There are some who have abodes under the soles of the feet, with whom I have occasionally conversed. I have seen some of them endeavoring to ascend, and it was also granted me to feel their endeavor, 
and this even to the knees; but they fell back again. In this manner is it represented to the sense when any are desirous of ascending from their own abodes to higher ones, as these were of ascending 
to the abodes of those who are in the province of the knees and thighs. I was told that such are they who have despised others in comparison with themselves; for which reason also they wish to emerge, 
and not only through the foot into the thigh, but also if possible above the head; yet still they fall back again. They are in a kind of stupidity; for such arrogance extinguishes and suffocates the 
light of heaven, and consequently intelligence. Wherefore the sphere which surrounds them appears like thick dregs. </p>

There are quite a number with dwelling-places beneath the soles of the feet to whom I have talked occasionally. I have seen some of them trying to work their way up from there, and I have also been allowed 
to have a sensation in my body of their attempts to do so. They reached as far as my knees, but then they sank down. This is what the representation involving the physical senses is like when any 
have the desire to move up from their own dwelling-places to higher ones, like those described here who had the desire to come up to the dwelling-places of those in the province of the knees and thighs. 
I was told that these are the kind of people who despised others in comparison with themselves, which is also the reason why they wish to rise up from where they are, not only through the foot into 
the thigh but also if possible above the head. But for all that, they sink down. In a way they are stupid, for that kind of arrogance blots out and smothers the light of heaven and therefore intelligence. 
This explains why the sphere which surrounds them looks like a thick sediment. </p>

</p><b>4949.</b>
Sunt plures qui mansiones habent sub plantis pedum, cum quibus quandoque locutus sum; vidi quosdam eorum quod conniterentur ascendere, et quoque connisum ascensus eorum sentire dabatur et hoc usque 
ad genua, sed relapsi sunt; repraesentatur ita coram sensu, cum aliqui ex suis mansionibus cupiunt ad superiores, sicut hi quod ad illorum mansiones qui in provincia genuum et femorum sunt; </p>
<p>dictum 
mihi quod tales sint qui alios contempserunt prae se, quapropter etiam volunt emergere, et non solum per pedem in femur, sed etiam si possent supra caput, at usque relabuntur; sunt in quodam genere 
stupiditatis, nam talis arrogantia exstinguit et {1} suffocat lucem caeli, proinde intelligentiam; quapropter sphaera quae circumfundit illos, apparet sicut crassamentum. @1 seu$ </p>
