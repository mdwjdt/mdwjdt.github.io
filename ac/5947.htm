<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5947节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5947.</strong>“并你们的父亲都接来”表它们的服务和靠近。这从“接他们的父亲”和“来”的含义清楚可知：“接他们的父亲”是指服侍，如下文所述；“来”是指靠近，如前所述（<a href="5941.htm">5941</a>节）。至于“接他们的父亲”所表示的服务，情况是这样：低级事物要为更内在的事物服务。低级事物是属世层中的教会真理，由雅各的儿子们来代表；而更内在的事物是属灵良善，由他们的父亲以色列来代表。由于该良善更内在，或也可说，更高级，所以那些更外在或更低级的事物要为它服务。因为低级事物被形成，无非是为了成为仆人或说服务的事物。事实上，它们以这种方式被形成：更内在的事物能在它们里面并通过它们生活和行动，以至于如果更内在的事物从它们那里被夺走，它们无非是没有生命和活动的器皿，因而完全是死的。身体相对于它的灵就是这种情况；因此，当灵离开它时，身体立刻仆倒死亡。外在人相对于内在人，以及内在人相对于主，也是这种情况。因为内在人得以形成，是为了从主接受生命，无非是主生命的器官。因此，它被形成以服务于主，是为了对主之爱和对邻之仁所要求的、先在自然界后在灵界的一切功用。</p>

And bring your father, and come. That this signifies their service and approach, is evident from the signification of "bringing their father," as being service (of which below); and from the signification 
of "coming," as being approach (as above, n. 5941). In regard to the service which is signified by "bringing their father," the case is this. Lower things ought to serve interior ones. The lower 
things are the truths of the church in the natural, which are represented by the sons of Jacob; but that which is interior is spiritual good, which is represented by Israel their father. This being more 
interior, or what is the same, higher, ought to be served by exterior or lower things. For lower things are formed for nothing else than to be things of service, for they are formed for the interior 
to live and act in them and through them, and indeed so that if the interior is taken away from them, they are nothing but vessels without life and action, thus altogether dead. This is the case with 
the body relatively to its spirit, and therefore when the spirit withdraws, the body at once dies. Such also is the case with the external man relatively to the internal, and also with the internal 
man relatively to the Lord; for the internal man has been formed to receive life from the Lord, and is nothing else than an organ of His life. Consequently it is formed to serve the Lord for all the 
uses that love to Him and charity toward the neighbor demand, first in the natural world, and afterward in the spiritual world. </p>

'And bring your father, and come' means their service and their drawing nearer. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing their father' as service, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'coming' 
as drawing nearer, as above in <a href="5941.htm">5941</a>. What is implied by the service meant by 'bringing their father' is this: Lower things ought to serve more internal ones. Lower things are the truths known to the 
Church in the natural, which are represented by 'the sons of Jacob', whereas what is more internal is spiritual good, represented by 'Israel their father'; and since this good is more internal, or what 
amounts to the same, is higher, it ought to be served by those things that are more external or lower. For lower things are fashioned to be nothing other than servants. Indeed they are fashioned in 
such a way that what is more internal may live and act within them and by means of them, so much so in fact that if what is more internal is taken away from them they are nothing but vessels devoid of 
life and activity, and so are completely dead. It is like the relationship of the body to its spirit, in that when the spirit departs from it the body immediately drops down dead. It is in addition 
like the relationship of the external man to the internal, and like that of the internal man to the Lord. The internal man has been fashioned to receive life from the Lord and is nothing else than an 
organ for the Lord's life. Consequently it has been fashioned to be of service to the Lord, for every useful purpose that love to Him and charity towards the neighbour demand, first in the natural world 
and after that in the spiritual world. </p>

</p><b>5947.</b>
`Et feratis patrem vestrum, et veniatis': quod significet servitium eorum et accessionem, constat ex significatione `ferre patrem' quod sit servitium, de qua sequitur; et a significatione `venire' quod 
sit accessio, ut supra n. 5941. Cum servitio quod significatur per `ferre patrem', ita se habet:  quae inferiora sunt, servire debent interioribus; inferiora {1}sunt vera Ecclesiae in naturali quae 
repraesentantur per `filios Jacobi'; interius autem est bonum spirituale, {2}quod repraesentatur per `Israelem patrem eorum', hoc quia interius, seu quod idem{2}, superius, serviri debet ab exterioribus 
seu inferioribus; sunt enim inferiora non ad aliud formata quam ut servitia sint, {3}nam sunt formata ut interius vivat et agat in illis et per illa{4}, et quidem ita ut si auferatur interius ab 
illis, non aliud sint quam vasa absque vita et actione, ita prorsus mortua; ita se habet cum corpore respective ad spiritum ejus, quare cum hic recedit, corpus statim occumbit mortuum; (c)ac ita se habet 
cum externo homine respective ad internum, et quoque ita se habet cum interno homine respective ad Dominum; formatus enim est internus homo ad recipiendum vitam a Domino, et est non nisi quam vitae 
Ipsius organum; consequenter est formatum ad inserviendum Domino, ad omnes usus quos amor in Ipsum et charitas erga proximum postulant, primum in mundo naturali et postea in mundo spirituali. @1 after
