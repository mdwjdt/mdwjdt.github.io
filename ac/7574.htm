<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7574.</strong>“下冰雹”表摧毁这些良善和真理的虚假。这从“冰雹”的含义清楚可知，“冰雹”是指由邪恶所生、摧毁教会的良善和真理的虚假（参看<a href="7553.htm">7553</a>节）。“冰雹”表示诸如摧毁教会的真理和良善的那类虚假，本章前面所描述的“瘟疫”也表示这类虚假。因为虚假和它们所源于的邪恶一样，有众多的属和种。“冰雹”所表示的虚假属于摧毁教会事物，只能存在于那些曾在教会，却过着违背那里的信之真理和良善的生活之人中间的那一属。虚假和邪恶一样，具有众多的属和种，这一点从以下事实明显可知：地狱照邪恶和由此衍生的虚假的属和种来划分，并且地狱是不计其数的。由此可见，这一事实是怎么回事，即：埃及的神迹或灾殃表示虚假和邪恶，每一个都表示虚假和邪恶的某个种或属，如血、青蛙、虱子、讨厌的苍蝇、瘟疫、起脓疱的疮、冰雹、蝗虫。</p>

And hail. That this signifies falsities destroying these goods and truths, is evident from the signification of "hail," as being falsities from evils destroying the goods and truths of the church (see 
n. 7553). By "hail" are signified such falsities as destroy the truths and goods of the church, as is also signified by the "pestilence" described above in this chapter; for there are very many genera 
and species of falsities, as there are of the evils from which they spring. The falsities signified by the "hail" are of the kind that destroy the things of the church, and are possible only with those 
who have been born in the church, and have lived contrary to the truths and goods of faith therein. That falsities, like evils, are of many genera and species, is evident from the fact that the hells 
are distinct according to the genera and species of evils and the derivative falsities, and that the hells are countless. From all this it can be seen how the case is with the fact that the miracles 
or plagues in Egypt signify falsities and evils, as the blood, the frogs, the lice, the noisome flies, the pestilence, the sore of pustules, the hail, and the locust, namely, that by each is signified 
some kind of falsity and evil. </p>

'And hail' means those destructive falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'hail' as falsities arising from evils destroying the Church's forms of good and its truths, <a href="7553.htm">7553</a>. 'Hail' means the kinds 
of falsities that destroy the Church's truths and forms of good, as also does the pestilence in the earlier part of this chapter. For there are very many genera and species of falsities, as there are 
of the evils from which they spring. The falsities meant by 'hail' belong to the genus that destroy things of the Church and that can exist only with those who have been born within the Church yet 
have led a life contrary to the truths and the forms of the good of faith there. Proof of the existence of falsities, like evils, in a large number of genera and species is provided by the fact that the 
hells are divided up according to genera and species of evils and derivative falsities, and by the fact that the hells are countless. From this one may see what the situation is with the meaning of 
the miracles or plagues in Egypt as falsities and evils. That is to say, one may see that each plague - of blood, frogs, lice, noxious flying insects, pestilence, sores breaking out into pustules, hail, 
or locusts - means a different kind or genus of falsity and evil. </p>

`Et grandinem': quod significet falsa destruentia illa, constat ex significatione `grandinis' quod sint falsa ex malis destruentia bona et vera Ecclesiae, {1} n. 7553.  (s)Per `grandinem' significantur 
talia falsa quae destruunt vera et bona Ecclesiae, ut quoque per `pestem' supra in hoc capite; sunt enim falsorum genera et species perplures, {2}sicut malorum ex quibus sunt; falsa quae per `grandinem' 
significantur sunt illius generis quod destruant illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, et dari possunt solum apud illos qui in Ecclesia nati sunt et vixerunt contra vera et bona fidei ibi.  Quod falsa sicut 
mala plurium generum et specierum (x)sint, constat ex eo quod inferna sint distincta secundum genera et species malorum (c)et inde falsorum, et quod inferna sint innumera.  Ex his constare potest quomodo 
se habet cum eo quod per miracula seu plagas in Aegypto significentur falsa et mala, sicut per sanguinem, ranas, pediculos, volatilia noxia, pestem, ulcus pustularum, grandinem, locustam, quod nempe 
per unumquodvis aliud genus falsi ac mali.(s) 	@1 i de qua$ 	@2 ut quoque$ </p>
