<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1815节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1815.</strong>“耶和华又对他说，我是耶和华”表主的内在人，也就是耶和华，直觉就出自祂。这从前面所述清楚可知，大意是：主的内在，即凡主从父那里所接受的，都是祂里面的耶和华，因为祂通过耶和华成孕。人从其父那里所接受之物是一回事，从其母那里所接受之物是另一回事。人从父接受一切内在之物，因为灵魂本身或生命来自父，而从母接受一切外在之物。总之，内层人，或灵本身来自父，而外层人，或肉体本身来自母。仅从以下事实，谁都能理解这一点，即灵魂本身通过父植入，并在卵子中以细微的肉体包裹自身。凡后来所添加之物，无论是在卵子中还是在子宫里，都出自母亲，因为它不从别处生长。<br />由此可见，就其内在而言，主就是耶和华。然而，由于主从母所接受的外在要与神性，即耶和华合一，并且如前所述，这事通过试探和胜利实现，故不可避免地在主看来，祂与耶和华说话时，仿佛与另一个人说话。然而，事实上，祂与自己对话，也就是说，目前祂已与耶和华合一。主所具有的直觉是最为完美的，远远超过所出生的一切人的直觉，因为它来自其内在人，也就是耶和华自己。这就是此处“耶和华又对他说”的内义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1815.</strong> He said to him, "I am Jehovah," symbolizes the Lord's inner self, which was Jehovah, the source of his perception. This can be seen from many earlier statements that the Lord's inner part (everything he received from the Father) was Jehovah in him, because he was conceived by Jehovah [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1414" target=_top>1414</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1573#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1573:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1602" target=_top>1602</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1607:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1707:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1725#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1725:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1733:2</a>].<br />We receive one thing from our father and another from our mother. From our father we receive everything inside us. Our soul itself — our life — is from him. From our mother we receive everything on the surface. In short, our inner self (our spirit itself) comes from our father, while our outer self (our actual body) comes from our mother. Anyone can grasp this simply by considering the fact that the soul itself is implanted by the father and sets about clothing itself in the tiny shape of a body in the ovum. Whatever is added after that, in either the ovum or the uterus, is the mother's, because the soul has no other supply of material to draw on.{*1} [2] This shows that the Lord was Jehovah in respect to his inner dimensions. The outer dimension that he received from his mother, however, needed to become one with his divine aspect, or Jehovah, which was accomplished through times of trial and victories, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1659:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1707:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1708" target=_top>1708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1737" target=_top>1737</a>]. As a result, at those stages, it could not help seeming to him as though he was talking to another person when he talked with Jehovah, despite the fact that he was talking to himself, at least insofar as the two were united.<br />The exquisite power of perception that the Lord had, more than anyone who has ever been born, came from his inner depths, that is, from Jehovah himself, as symbolized here on an inner level by "Jehovah said to him."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The statement in this paragraph that our soul or what is "inside us" is from the father, while what is "outside" is from the mother, may be surprising to current sensibilities. It cannot be understood without an appreciation of Swedenborg's theory of human generation, which derives from a long chain of thinkers going back to Aristotle. According to that theory, the first phase in the formation of a child occurs in the male brain, when the simple cortex — the intellect-bearing region — releases a vital essence. This essence is what Swedenborg terms "human seed" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_584" target=_top>True Christianity 584:1</a>). From the fibers of the brain the human seed is carried to the blood, where it is borne to the testicles. After being extracted from the blood in the testicles, it receives further "coverings" in the epididymes, the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the urethra. This semen carries the soul and implants it in the ovum of the mother, where the soul "clothes itself in the shape of a body" by a process of accretion called epigenesis. The material added in that process "is the mother's, because the soul has no other supply of material to draw on." (The ovum, however, is seen only as a growing medium for the embryo; it contains nothing that directs the growth of the new human being.) In an analogous manner in the case of Jesus, his "inner dimensions" came directly from God the Father, and his outer "surface" from his mother, Mary. For some qualifications to this theory, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1414" target=_top>1414</a> above. For more on Swedenborg's theory of how the soul comes to be in the embryo, see Draft on the Reproductive Organs (Swedenborg 1928) 354-358; for more on the material development of the semen, see Swedenborg [1771] 2012, page 520 note 238 [NCBSP: This is a reference to a work in the bibliography from the Swedenborg Foundation].

He said unto him, I am Jehovah. That this signifies the Lord's internal man, which is Jehovah, and from which He had perception, is evident from what has been already said, namely, that the Lord's Internal, 
that is, whatever the Lord received from the Father, was Jehovah in Him, for He was conceived from Jehovah. What a man receives from his father is one thing, and what he receives from his mother 
is another. From his father a man receives all that is internal, his soul itself or life being from the father; but he receives from his mother all that is external. In a word, the interior man, or 
spirit itself, is from the father; but the outer man, or body itself, is from the mother; which everyone can comprehend merely from the fact that the soul itself is implanted by the father, and this 
begins to clothe itself in a little bodily form in the ovum. Whatever is afterwards added, whether in the ovum or in the womb, is of the mother, for it has no increase from anywhere else.  [2] It may 
be seen from this that as to His internals the Lord was Jehovah. But because the external, which the Lord received from the mother, was to be united to the Divine or Jehovah, and this through temptations 
and victories, as before said, it could not appear otherwise to Him in those states, than that when He spoke with Jehovah it was as it were with another; when yet He spoke with Himself, that is, 
so far as He was in a state of conjunction. The Lord's perception, which He had in the highest perfection above all who have been born, was from His Internal, that is, from Jehovah Himself, which is here 
signified in the internal sense by the words, "Jehovah said unto him." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1815</b></p><p><b>1815.</b>
'He said to him, I am Jehovah' means the Lord's Internal Man which is Jehovah, from whom perception came. This is clear from what has been stated in various places already, to the effect that the Lord's 
Internal, that is, whatever the Lord received from the Father, was in Him Jehovah - for He was conceived from Jehovah. That which a person receives from the, father is one thing, while that from the 
mother is another. From the father a person receives everything that is internal, the soul itself or life being from the father; but from the mother he receives everything that is external. In short, 
the interior man or spirit itself comes from the father, but the exterior man or body itself from the mother. This anyone may grasp merely from the consideration that the soul itself is inseminated 
by the father, and starts to clothe itself in the ovum with a tiny body. All else that is subsequently added to it, both in the ovum and in the womb, comes from the mother, for it receives nothing contributing 
to its growth from anywhere else. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it becomes clear that internally the Lord was Jehovah. Since however the external which the Lord received from the mother was to be united 
to the Divine, or Jehovah - and this, as has been stated, was accomplished by means of temptations and victories - it inevitably appeared to Him that when He spoke to Jehovah, it was as if to another. 
But in fact He spoke to Himself, that is to say, insofar as He had become joined to Jehovah. The perception which the Lord possessed - being most perfect, far superior to that of every other who has 
ever been born - sprang from His Internal Man, that is, from Jehovah Himself; and this is meant here in the internal sense by 'Jehovah said to him'. </p>

</p><b>1815.</b>
'Dixit ad illum, Ego Jehovah': quod significet Internum Hominem Domini Qui Jehovah, unde perceptio, constat ex illis quae passim prius dicta sunt, nempe quod Internum Domini, hoc est, quodcumque Dominus 
ex Patre accepit, in Ipso fuerit Jehovah, nam, ex Jehovah conceptus est: aliud est quod homo accipit a patre et aliud quod a matre; a patre accipit homo omne quod internum est, ipsa anima seu vita 
est ex patre, sed a matre accipit omne quod externum est; verbo, interior homo seu ipse spiritus est a patre, sed exterior homo seu ipsum corpus est a matre; quod quisque capere potest solum ex eo quod 
ipsa anima implantetur a patre, quae incohat se induere corpusculari forma in ovulo; quicquid dein adjicitur tam in ovulo quam in utero, est matris, nam aliunde accrementum non habet: [2] inde constare 
potest quod Dominus quoad Interna fuerint Jehovah: at quia externum quod Dominus accepit a matre, uniendum esset Divino seu Jehovae, et hoc per tentationes et victorias, ut dictum, non potuit aliter 
in statibus illis Ipsi apparere quam quando cum Jehovah locutus est, quod esset quasi cum alio, cum tamen Ipse locutus fuit secum quantum nempe conjunctus fuit.  Perceptio quam Dominus habuit perfectissimam 
prae omnibus qui nati sunt, fuit ex Interno Ipsius, hoc est, ex Ipso Jehovah, quod hic in sensu interno significatur per id quod 'dixerit ad illum Jehovah.' </p>
