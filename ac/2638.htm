<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2638节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2638.</strong>创世记21:6，7.撒拉说，神使我喜笑，凡听见的必与我一同喜笑。又说，谁能对亚伯拉罕说，撒拉要乳养儿子呢？因为我给年老的他生了一个儿子。<br />“撒拉说”表出于神性属灵之物的直觉。“神使我喜笑”表对属天真理的情感。“凡听见的必与我一同喜笑”表将拥有这情感的一切事物。“又说”表思维。“谁能对亚伯拉罕说，撒拉要乳养儿子呢”表主凭自己的力量将人性植入在神性中。“因为我给年老的他生了一个儿子”表当日子满了，这事就成就了。</p>

Verses 6, 7. And Sarah said, God hath made laughter for me; everyone that heareth will laugh with me. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons? For I have borne a son to 
his old age. "Sarah said" signifies perception from the Divine spiritual; "God hath made laughter for me," signifies the affection of celestial truth; "everyone that heareth will laugh with me," signifies 
that all things in it will have this affection; "and she said," signifies thought; "who would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons?" signifies that the Lord implanted the Human in the 
Divine by His own power; "for I have borne a son to his old age," signifies that this was done when the days were fulfilled. </p>

Verses 6, 7 And Sarah said, God has made laughter for me; everyone that hears will laugh for me. And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle sons? For I have borne [him] a son in 
his old age. </p>
<p>'Sarah said' means perception from the Divine spiritual. 'God has made laughter for me' means the affection for celestial truth. 'Everyone who hears will laugh for-me' means that all things 
there will possess the affection. 'And she said' means thought. 'Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle sons?' means that by His own power the Lord implanted the Human within the Divine. 
'For I have borne [him] a son in his old age' means that this was accomplished when the days had been completed. </p>

</p><b>2638.</b>
Vers. 6, 7.  Et dixit Sarah, Risum fecit mihi Deus, omnis audiens ridebit mihi.  Et dixit, Quis dixisset Abrahamo, Lactabit filios Sarah? quia peperi filium senectuti illius. `Dixit Sarah' significat 
perceptionem ex Divino spirituali: `Risum fecit nihil Deus' significat affectionem veri caelestis: `omnis audiens ridebit mihi' significat quod omnia ibi affectionem habitura: `et dixit' significat cogitationem: 
`quis dixisset Abrahamo, Lactabit filios Sarah?' significat quod Dominus propria potentia implantaverit Humanum Divino: `quia peperi filium senectuti ejus' significat quod hoc fieret cum 
dies completi essent. </p>
