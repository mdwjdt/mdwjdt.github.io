<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6865节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6865.</strong>“使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来”表随之那些属于属灵教会的人从侵扰的虚假当中所获得的解救。这从“领出来”、“以色列人”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：“领出来”是指解救；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）；“埃及”是指教会真理对立的虚假记忆知识，因而是指侵扰的虚假（参看<a href="6692.htm">6692</a>节）。<br />侵扰那些属于属灵教会之人的，主要是虚假的记忆知识。原因是，他们对源于良善的真理没有觉知，只有从教义所得来的真理的知识。像这样的人很容易被记忆知识侵扰，因为记忆知识是最一般的容器；在引入它们的真理使它们变得透明之前，它们有时看似与真理相反，因而不被注意。此外，记忆知识充满感官幻觉或谬误；那些只有从教义所获得的事物的知识，对源于良善的真理没有觉知的人无法驱散这些感官幻觉或谬误。主要原因是，世界的光在他们中间占导地位；只要天堂之光不流入它，这光似乎就清晰；但是，一旦天堂之光流入，并穿透它，这光就变得模糊。这解释了为何这些人在世俗的事上通达、聪明，但在天堂的事上却迟钝、愚蠢。当这些人为自己证实其教会的教义时，他们自认为通达。但是，当他们如此想时，正是源于世界之光的低级感官之光欺骗了他们。因为一切宗教教义，无论哪种，都能被证实；如犹太人能证实自己的教义，狂热之徒能证实他们狂热的教义，苏西尼派能证实苏西尼派的教义，各种异端能证实各自的异端教义。一旦这些教义被证实，在感官之光中，它们在这些人看来，就像是真正的真理。但那些凭天堂之光看见的人从主领受启示；在证实之前，他们会看看在下面并在那里被有序排列的记忆知识，以辨别真理能不能被它们所证实。由此明显可知，后一种人从在记忆知识之上，因而与记忆知识不同且分离的更内在位置来看待事物；而前一种人的视角比较低下，就在记忆知识里面，从而纠缠于记忆知识中（参看<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>节）。</p>

And do thou bring forth My people the sons of Israel out of Egypt. That this signifies the consequent liberation of those who are of the spiritual church from infesting falsities is evident from the 
signification of "bringing forth" as being liberation; from the signification of the "sons of Israel" as being those of the spiritual church (see n. 6637); and from the signification of "Egypt" as being 
the false memory-knowledge which is against the truths of the church; thus infesting falsity (see n. 6692). [2] It is false memory-knowledge which chiefly infests those of the spiritual church; because 
they have no perception of truth from good, but only the memory-knowledge of truth from doctrine; they who are such are very much infested by memory-knowledges. For memory-knowledges are the most 
general vessels, which sometimes appear contrary to truths, until truths being let into them make them transparent, and thus not to be noticed. Moreover, memory-knowledges are full of the fallacies 
of the senses, which cannot be dispelled by those who are in mere knowledges from doctrine, and not in the perception of truth from good; mainly because the light of the world predominates with them, 
which light appears clear so long as the light of heaven does not flow into it, but as soon as the light of heaven flows in, instead of light it becomes obscurity. Hence it is that these persons are enlightened 
and clever in the things of the world, but obscured and dull in the things of heaven. [3] These believe themselves enlightened when they have confirmed in themselves the doctrinal things of 
the church, but it is a sensuous light from the light of the world which then deceives them; for doctrinal things of every kind can be confirmed, as Jewish doctrinal things by the Jews, enthusiastic 
ones by enthusiasts, Socinian ones by the Socinians, and heresies by heretics of every sort; and when they have been confirmed, they appear to them in the sensuous light as very truths. But they who 
are in the light of heaven are in enlightenment from the Lord; and before confirmations, by looking into the memory-knowledges which are beneath and are there arranged in order, they discern whether it 
is a truth that may be confirmed or not. Hence it is evident that these latter have an interior view, which is above the memory-knowledges, and thus is distinct; whereas the former have a lower view, 
which is within the memory-knowledges, and thus is an entangled one (see n. 2831). </p>

'And lead My people the children of Israel out of Egypt' means the consequent deliverance of those belonging to the spiritual Church from molesting falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'leading 
out' as deliverance; from the meaning of 'the children of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>; and from the meaning of 'Egypt' as false factual knowledge that is 
opposed to the Church's truths, thus falsity that molests, dealt with in <a href="6692.htm">6692</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Falsity within factual knowledge is what most of all molests those who belong to the spiritual Church. The reason 
for this is that they do not have a perception of truth that springs from good, only a knowledge of truth derived from religious teaching. People like these are subject very much to molestation from factual 
knowledge, for known facts serve as very general vessels, and until truths have been introduced into them to make them translucent, so that one no longer notices them, they may sometimes appear 
to be contrary to truths. Furthermore factual knowledge is full of the illusions of the senses which cannot be dispelled by those who have only a knowledge of things derived from religious teaching and 
no perception of truth that springs from good. The main reason for this is that the light of the world holds sway with these people, a light which seems to be clear light as long as the light of heaven 
does not flow into it but which turns from light into obscurity the moment that the light of heaven penetrates it. This explains why these people are enlightened and clever in worldly matters but 
dull and obtuse in heavenly ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These people think that they are the enlightened when they have substantiated the teachings of their Church for themselves. But it is the inferior light of the 
senses, derived from the light of the world, that deceives them when they think so. For all religious teachings, no matter what kind they are, are capable of being substantiated. Jews are able to substantiate 
their own teachings, Enthusiasts<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> theirs, Socinians theirs, and all kinds of heretics theirs. And once these teachings have been substantiated the light of the senses makes them appear to those 
people to be actual truths. But those who see by the light of heaven receive their enlightenment from the Lord; and before substantiating anything they view the factual knowledge below, arranged 
into order there, to discern whether or not a truth can be substantiated by it. From this it is evident that the latter kind of people see things from a more internal position which is above factual knowledge 
and so is distinct and separate from it, whereas the former's viewpoint, being lower, is situated within factual knowledge and so tangled up in it, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>.

`Et educ populum Meum filios Israelis ex Aegypto': quod significet inde liberationem illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali a falsis infestantibus, constat ex significatione `educere' quod sit liberatio; 
ex significatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 6637; et ex significatione `Aegypti' quod sit scientificum falsum quod contra vera Ecclesiae, ita falsum infestans, 
de qua n. 6692. 	2 Est falsum scientificum quod maxime infestat illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; causa est quia non perceptionem veri ex bono habent, sed modo cognitionem veri ex doctrina; 
qui tales sunt, quam maxime infestantur a scientificis; scientifica enim sunt vasa communissima quae apparent quandoque contraria veris, priusquam vera illis immissa faciunt ut {1}transluceant, et sic 
non appercipiantur; et praeterea scientifica sunt plena fallaciis sensuum quae discuti nequeunt ab illis qui in solis cognitionibus ex doctrina sunt et non in perceptione veri ex bono; imprimis quia 
lux mundi apud illos praedominium habet, quae lux apparet clara quamdiu lux caeli non in illam influit, sed ut primum lux caeli illabitur, fit loco lucis obscurum; inde est quod illi illuminati et ingeniosi 
{2} sint in rebus mundi, sed obscurati et hebetes in rebus caeli. 	3 Hi {3} credunt se illuminatos, cum doctrinalia Ecclesiae apud se confirmarunt, sed est lumen sensuale quod ex lumine mundi 
quod tunc fallit illos; doctrinalia enim confirmari possunt qualiacumque sint, sicut sua a Judaeis, sua ab Enthusiastis, sua a Socinianis, et sua a quibusvis haereticis; et cum confirmata sunt, apparent 
in lumine sensuali illis ut ipsa vera.  At qui in luce caeli sunt in illustratione sunt a Domino, et ante confirmationem appercipiunt per intuitionem in scientifica quae infra sunt et ibi in ordinem 
disposita, num verum confirmabile sit vel non; inde patet quod hi interiorem intuitionem habeant quae est supra scientifica, ita distinctam; illi autem intuitionem inferiorem quae est intra scientifica, 
ita perplexam, n. 2831. 	@1 paene non appercipiantur sed translucent$ 	@2 i prae aliis$ 	@3 i usque$ </p>
