<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2853节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2853.</strong>“并且地上万族都必因你的种得福”表所有具有良善之人的救恩。这从“得福”、“种”和“地上万族”的含义清楚可知：“得福”是指富有属天和属灵之善（参看<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>，<a href="1422.htm">1422</a>节），在此是指得救，因为所论述的是那些得救的人（众所周知，“得福”的意义非常广泛）；“种”是指仁之信（参看<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节）；“地上万族”是指那些具有良善的人（参看<a href="1159.htm">1159</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）。<br />此外，这些话还含有以下奥秘：通过此处“地”所表示的教会（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>节），那些教会外的人也能得救。因为正如刚才说的，“你的种”表仁之信。除了教会中人以外，没有人具有仁之信，因为仁之信是与生命之善相结合的教义真理。真相乃是这样：主在地上的国是由所有具有良善的人组成的，尽管他们分散在全地，但仍为一，如同各个部位构成一个身体。主在天上的国也是这样。在那里，整个天堂呈现为一个完全的人，因此也被称作大人（<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="1276.htm">1276</a>节）。说来奇妙，并且至今不为人所知的是，人体的各个部位都与天上的各个社群相对应。故有时，有人会说，这组社群属头部区域，那组社群属眼部区域，另外一组属胸部区域，等等。蒙主怜悯，我们将拿出一节来单独论述这种对应关系。<br />主在地上的教会也一样。地上的教会就像心与肺，而那些教会之外的人则类似人体中那些靠心肺支撑和存活的部位。由此明显可知，若非地上某个地方存在一个教会，人类便无法生存，就像人体离了心肺无法生存一样（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2054.htm">2054</a>节）。正因如此，每当教会因仁爱荡然无存而终结，也就是不再是一个教会时，按照主的旨意，总有一个新教会举起。例如，当被称作“人”的上古教会灭亡时，主便创造了名为“挪亚”的教会，该教会就是大洪水后的古教会。当这个教会堕落，不再是一个教会时，犹太人和以色列人的代表性教会就建立了。当该教会完全灭绝时，主就降世，再次建立一个新教会。主这样做的目的，是为了天堂与人类可以通过教会结合。这也是“地上万族都必因你的种得福”这句话的意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2853</b></p><p><b>2853.</b>
In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. That this signifies the salvation of all who are in good, is evident from the signification of "being blessed," as being to be enriched with 
celestial and spiritual good (see n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422); here, to be saved, because spoken of those who are saved (that "to be blessed" has a comprehensive meaning is well known); from the signification 
of "seed," as being the faith of charity (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610); and from the signification of the "nations of the earth," as being those who are in good (see n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849). 
 [2] Moreover in these words there is contained the following arcanum: that through the church (which is here the "earth," n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262) those are saved who are out of the church; for 
as just stated, "thy seed" denotes the faith of charity; and no others are in the faith of charity than those within the church, for the faith of charity is truth of doctrine adjoined to good of life. 
The case is this: The Lord's kingdom on earth consists of all those who are in good, who though scattered over the whole earth, are still one, and as members constitute one body. Such is the Lord's kingdom 
in the heavens, where the whole heaven represents one man, which is therefore also called the Grand Man (n. 684, 1276); and what is wonderful and hitherto unknown, all parts of the human body correspond 
to societies in heaven. And therefore it is sometimes said that some societies belong to the province of the head, some to the province of the eye, others to that of the chest, and so on, which 
correspondence will of the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of by itself.  [3] The case is the same with the Lord's church on earth, where the church is like the heart and lungs; while those outside 
the church answer to the parts of the body which are supported and live from the heart and lungs. Hence it is manifest that without a church somewhere on the earth the human race could not subsist, as 
the body could not without the heart and lungs (see n. 468, 637, 931, 2054). From this cause it is that whenever any church is consummated, that is, becomes no church because there is no longer any 
charity, a new one is of the Lord's providence always raised up; as when the Most Ancient Church called "Man" perished, a new one was created by the Lord, which was called "Noah," and was the Ancient 
Church that was after the flood; and when this degenerated and became none, the Jewish and Israelitish representative Church was instituted; and when this became altogether extinct, the Lord then came 
into the world, and set up again a new one; and this for the purpose that there might be conjunction of heaven with the human race through the church. This is also what is signified by "in thy seed shall 
all the nations of the earth be blessed." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2853</b></p><p><b>2853.</b>
'In your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed' means the salvation of all who are endowed with good. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed' as being enriched with celestial and 
spiritual good (dealt with in <a href="981.htm">981</a>, <a href="1096.htm">1096</a>, <a href="1420.htm">1420</a>, <a href="1422.htm">1422</a>) and - since those who are saved are the subject - as being saved, for as is well known 'being blessed' has a wide range of meanings; from the meaning 
of 'seed' as faith that is the expression of charity, dealt with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>; and from the meaning of 'the nations of the earth' as those who are endowed with good, dealt with in <a href="1159.htm">1159</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition to this, these words contain the following arcanum: By means of the Church, meant here by 'the earth', <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, those people are saved who are outside 
of the Church, for 'your seed', as has been stated, means faith that is the expression of charity. Faith that is the expression of charity occurs only with those within the Church since such faith 
is in essence truth taught by doctrine coupled to goodness of life. For the truth of the matter is that the Lord's kingdom on earth consists of all those who are endowed with good, who, though spread 
throughout the whole world, are nevertheless one, and as members constitute one body. The same is so with the Lord's kingdom in the heavens. There the whole of heaven presents itself as one entire human 
being, which is for that reason also called the Grand Man, <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="1276.htm">1276</a>. And what is a marvel and unknown until now, all parts of the human body correspond to communities in heaven. For this reason 
it is sometimes said that this group of communities belong to the province of the head, that group to the province of the eye, another group to that of the chest, and so on. This correspondence will in 
the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed in a section by itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is similar with the Lord's Church on earth. Here the Church is like the heart and lungs, and those outside of the Church resemble 
parts of the body which are sustained by, and get their life from, the heart and lungs. From this it is evident that without the Church somewhere on earth the human race cannot continue to exist, even 
as the body cannot without the heart and lungs in it, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="931.htm">931</a>, <a href="2054.htm">2054</a>. It is for this reason that as often as any Church reaches its end, that is, ceases to be a Church because no charity 
exists any more, the Lord in His Providence always raises up a new one. When for example the Most Ancient Church, which was called Man, perished, the Lord created a new one, which was referred to as Noah. 
This was the Ancient Church, which existed after the Flood. And when this declined and became no longer a Church, the Jewish and Israelite representative Church was brought into being. And when this 
became wholly extinct the Lord came into the world and again established a new one. This was done by Him to the end that heaven might be joined to the human race by means of the Church. This is also 
what is meant by the words 'in your seed all nations of the earth will be blessed'. </p>

`Benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terrae': quod significet salvationem omnium qui in bono sunt, constat a significatione `benedici' quod sit locupletari bono caelesti et spirituali, de qua n. 
981, 1096, 1420, 1422, et quia illi sunt qui salvantur, hic `benedici' significat {1}salvari; quod benedici latae significationis sit, notum est; ex significatione `seminis' quod sit fides charitatis, 
de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610; et ex significatione `gentium terrae' quod sint illi qui in bono, de qua n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849. Praeterea hoc arcanum in his verbis 2 etiam continetur, quod per 
Ecclesiam, quae hic est terra, n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, salventur illi qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, `semen' enim `tuum' est, ut dictum, fides charitatis; in fide charitatis non alii sunt quam qui intra 
Ecclesiam sunt, nam fides charitatis est verum doctrinae adjunctum bono vitae; ita enim se res habet: regnum Domini in terris consistit ab omnibus illis qui in bono sunt, qui tametsi sparsi per totum 
terrarum orbem, usque tamen unum sunt, et sicut membra constituunt unum corpus; tale est regnum Domini in caelis, ibi universum caelum refert unum hominem, qui ideo etiam Maximus Homo vocatur, n. 684, 
1276; et quod mirabile et hactenus ignotum, correspondent omnes partes corporis humani societatibus in caelo quare aliquoties dictum, quod illae societates pertineant ad provinciam capitis, illae ad 
provinciam oculi, aliae ad pectoris, et sic porro, de qua correspondentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, seorsim dicetur 3 {2}similiter se habet cum Ecclesia Domini in terris, ibi Ecclesia est instar 
cordis et pulmonum, et qui extra Ecclesiam referunt partes corporis quae a corde et pulmonibus sustentantur et vivunt; inde patet quod absque Ecclesia alicubi in terris non subsistere possit genus humanum, 
sicut corpus nisi ibi cor et pulmones, videatur n. 468, 637, 931, 2054; ex hac causa est quod quoties aliqua Ecclesia consummatur, hoc est, nulla fit quia nulla amplius charitas, tunc ex Providentia 
Domini nova semper exsuscitetur; sicut cum Antiquissima Ecclesia periit, quae vocata `Homo,' tunc nova a Domino creata, quae dicta `Noahus,' et fuit Antiqua quae post diluvium; et cum haec degeneravit 
et nulla facta, Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica et Israelitica instituta est; et cum haec prorsus exstincta, tunc Dominus in mundum venit et novam instauravit; et {3}hoc ob causam ut conjunctio 
esse caeli cum humano genere per Ecclesiam: hoc quoque est quod significatur per quod `benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gente terrae.' @1 salvationem$ @2 A has a marginal note de communione sanctorum,
