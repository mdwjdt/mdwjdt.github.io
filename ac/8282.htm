<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8282节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8282.</strong>“耶和华啊，你用右手摔碎仇敌”表全能在邪恶和由此衍生的虚假上面所拥有的效果，其能力被消灭。这从“耶和华的右手”、“摔碎”和“仇敌”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的右手”是指主的全能，如刚才所述（<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>节）；“摔碎”是指消灭；“仇敌”是指邪恶和虚假，因为在圣言中，“仇敌”、“敌人”和“仇恨的人”并非表示别的。他们被称为“敌人”、“仇敌”和“仇恨的人”，不是因为主是他们的敌人，或对他们心怀仇恨，而是因为他们仇恨神性，与神性为敌。然而，当他们经历他们给自己带来的荒凉，把自己投入诅咒和地狱时，表面上看，好像这一切是从神性来的。这种表象或幻觉就像一个人看见太阳每天绕我们地球旋转，于是就以为太阳在移动，而事实上，是地球在移动；或像一个人触犯了法律，因此从国王或法官那里收到判决、受到惩罚，于是以为惩罚来自国王或法律，而事实上，这一切来自他自己，因为他触犯了法律。这种表象又像是一个人将自己扔进水中或火中，或扔到拔出的剑上，或一帮仇敌当中，然后以为是这些东西或人毁灭了他，而事实上，是他自己毁灭了自己。那些沉浸于邪恶，起来反对神性，并将自己投入毁灭当中的人就是这种情况。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8282</b></p><p><b>8282.</b>
With Thy right hand, O Jehovah, Thou breakest in pieces the enemy. That this signifies the effect of omnipotence on evils and the derivative falsities, the power of which is being annihilated, is evident 
from the signification of "the right hand of Jehovah," as being the Lord's omnipotence (of which just above, n. 8281); from the signification of "to break in pieces," as being to annihilate, and 
from the signification of "the enemy," as being evils and falsities, for nothing else is meant in the spiritual sense by the "enemies," "foes," and "haters" mentioned in the Word. They are not called 
"enemies," "foes," and "haters," because the Lord is an enemy, or bears hatred to them, but because they are haters and enemies against the Divine; yet when they devastate themselves, and cast themselves 
into damnation and into hell, it appears as if this comes from the Divine. This appearance, or fallacy, is circumstanced like one who sees the sun making every day a revolution round our earth, and 
consequently believes that this motion is of the sun, when yet it is of the earth; and it is circumstanced like one who sins against the laws, and on this account is judged by a king or judge, and punished, 
and who believes that the punishment comes from the king or judge; when yet it comes from himself, who acts contrary to the laws; also it is like one who casts himself into the water, or into 
the fire, or against a drawn sword, or against a troop of enemies, and should believe that his perdition comes therefrom; when yet it comes from himself. Such is the case with those who are in evil, 
who rise against the Divine, and cast themselves into the midst of perdition. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8282</b></p><p><b>8282.</b>
'With Your right hand, O Jehovah, You break the enemy in pieces' means the effect almighty power has on evils and resulting falsities, whose power is eliminated. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah's 
right hand' as the Lord's almighty power, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8281.htm">8281</a>; from the meaning of 'breaking in pieces' as eliminating; and from the meaning of 'the enemy' as evils and falsities, 
since nothing else is meant in the spiritual sense of the Word by those who are enemies, foes, and haters. The reason why the terms enemies, foes, and haters are used, is not that the Lord is an 
enemy to them or hates them, but because they hate and are hostile towards the Divine. When however they undergo vastation which they themselves bring about, and cast themselves into damnation and into 
hell, it appears as though the Divine is responsible for what is happening to them. This appearance or illusion is as when someone sees the sun making a circuit each day around our planet and from this 
supposes that the sun is moving, when in fact the planet is doing so. Or it is as when someone receives a sentence from the king or judge and is punished because he has broken the law, and then supposes 
that the king or judge is responsible for what he suffers, when in fact he who has broken the law is himself responsible. Or that appearance is as when someone hurls himself into water or fire, 
or onto an outstretched sword, or an enemy troop, and then supposes that these are responsible for his destruction, when in fact he himself is. The same is so when those immersed in evil raise themselves 
up against the Divine, and cast themselves into the midst of His presence. </p>

</p><b>8282.</b>
`Dextra Tua, Jehovah, confringis hostem': quod significet omnipotentiae effectum in mala et inde falsa, quorum potentia annihilatur, constat ex significatione `dextrae Jehovae' quod sit omnipotentia 
Domini, de qua nunc supra n. (x)8281; ex significatione `confringere' quod sit annihilare; et ex significatione `hostis' quod sint mala et falsa, nam non aliud in sensu spirituali per hostes, inimicos, 
et osores in Verbo intelligitur; hostes, inimici, et osores vocantur, non quod Dominus illis hostis sit aut odio habeat, sed quia {1}illi osores et hostes sunt contra Divinum; {2}cum autem ipsi se 
devastant, inque damnationem et in infernum conjiciunt, apparet sicut id veniat ex Divino; apparentia illa seu fallacia se habet sicut qui videt solem quotidie circum tellurem nostram facientem gyrum, 
et inde credit quod motus ille sit solis, cum tamen est telluris; seque habet sicut qui contra leges peccat, et propterea judicatur a rege {3}vel judice et punitur, quod credat id ex rege {3}vel judice 
venire, cum tamen ab ipso qui facit contra leges; pariter sicut qui se in aquam vel in ignem, vel qui contra gladium {4}extensum, vel contra turmam hostilem, conjicit, quod crediturus quod inde veniat 
ei perditio cum tamen ab ipso; ita se habet cum {5}illis qui in malo sunt, qui se contra Divinum efferunt, et conjiciunt in medium ejus. 	@1 ipsi hostes et osores sint$ 	@2 sed cum$ 	@3 seu$ 	@4 
evaginatum, aut$ 	@5 malis$ </p>
