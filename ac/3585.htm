<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3585.</strong>创世记27:30-33.以撒为雅各祝福已毕，雅各从他父亲以撒面前才出来，他哥哥以扫正打猎回来。他也作了美味，拿来给他父亲，对他父亲说，请父亲起来，吃他儿子的野味，好叫你的灵魂给我祝福。他父亲以撒对他说，你是谁？他说，我是你的儿子，你的长子以扫。以撒就大大地战兢说，是谁得了野味拿来给我呢？你未来之先，我已经吃了，为他祝福，他将来也必蒙福。<br />“以撒为雅各祝福已毕”表当第一次结合如此实现后。“雅各从他父亲以撒面前才出来”表状态的发展和变化。“他哥哥以扫正打猎回来”表从良善所获得的真理及其到达。“他也作了美味，拿来给他父亲”表令神圣理性称心和快乐的事物。“对他父亲说，请父亲起来，吃他儿子的野味”表以便神圣理性将从属世良善所获得的真理归为己有。“好叫你的灵魂给我祝福”表为了能结合。“他父亲以撒对他说，你是谁？他说，我是你的儿子，你的长子以扫”表对属世良善和由此衍生的真理的直觉状态。“以撒就大大地战兢”表伴随状态颠倒的极大变化。“说，是谁得了野味拿来给我呢”表关于那真理的询问。“你未来之先，我已经吃了”表它已被归为己有。“为他祝福，他将来也必蒙福”表它已被结合。</p>

Verses 30-33. And it came to pass as Isaac made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was scarcely yet gone out from the faces of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came from his hunting. And he also 
made dainties, and brought unto his father; and he said unto his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's hunting, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? 
And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau. And Isaac shuddered with exceeding great shuddering, and said, Who then is he that hath hunted hunting, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all 
before thou camest and blessed him? Yea, and he shall be blessed. "And it came to pass as Isaac made an end of blessing Jacob," signifies when the first conjunction had been thus effected; "and Jacob 
was scarcely yet gone out from the faces of Isaac his father," signifies progression and change of state; "that Esau his brother came from his hunting," signifies the truth of good and its arrival; 
"and he also made dainties, and brought unto his father," signifies things desirable and delightful to the Divine rational; "and he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's hunting," 
signifies that it should appropriate to itself the truth of natural good; "that thy soul may bless me," signifies that there might be conjunction; "and Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? 
And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau," signifies a state of perception concerning natural good and the derivative truth; "and Isaac shuddered with exceeding great shuddering," signifies 
a great alteration in respect to the inversion of the state; "and said, Who then is he that hath hunted hunting, and brought it to me," signifies an inquisition concerning that truth; "and I have eaten 
of all before thou camest," signifies that it was appropriated; "and blessed him; yea, and he shall be blessed," signifies that it had been conjoined. </p>

Verses 30-33 And so it was, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had only just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. And he 
too made savoury food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat from his son's venison, so that your soul may bless me. And Isaac his father said to him, 
Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau. And Isaac trembled very greatly, and he said, Who then is he who has hunted venison and brought it to me, and I have eaten from all of it 
before you came in, and have blessed him? Indeed, he will be blessed! </p>
<p>'And so it was, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob' means when the first joining together had accordingly been effected. 
'And Jacob had only just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father' means the development and the change that took place in this state. 'That Esau his brother came in from his hunting' means 
truth acquired from good and its arrival. 'And he too made savoury food, and brought it to his father' means things that were desirable and delightful to the Divine Rational. 'And he said to his father, 
Let my father arise, and eat from his son's venison' means so that it might make truth acquired from natural good its own. 'So that your soul may bless me' means so that it might join itself to this. 
'And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau' means a state of perception concerning natural good and concerning truth from that good. 'And Isaac 
trembled very greatly' means the great change that accompanied the inversion of state. 'And he said, Who then is he who has hunted venison and brought it to me' means questioning regarding that truth. 
'And I have eaten from all of it before you came in' means which had been made its own. 'And have blessed him? Indeed, he will be blessed!' means that it was indeed joined to it. </p>

Vers. 30-33.  Et fuit, quemadmodum absolvit Jishak benedicere Jacobo, et fuit tantum exeundo exivit Jacob ex faciebus Jishaki patris sui, et Esau frater ejus venit e venatione sua. Et fecit etiam is 
cupedias, et adduxit patri suo, et dixit patri suo, Surgat pater meus, et edat e venatione filii sui, propterea ut benedicat mihi anima tua. Et dixit ei Jishak pater ejus, Quis tu? et dixit, Ego filius 
tuus, primogenitus tuus Esau. Et horruit Jishak horrore magno usque valde, et dixit, Quis igitur ille qui venatus venationem, et adduxit mihi, et edi ab omni antequam venisti, et benedixi ei? etiam 
benedictus erit. `Et fuit, quemadmodum absolvit Jishak benedicere Jacobo' significat cum conjunctio prima ita facta: `et fuit tantum exeundo exivit Jacob ex faciebus Jishaki patris sui' significat status 
progressionem et mutationem: `et Esau frater ejus venit e venatione sua' significat boni verum et ejus adventum: `et fecit etiam is cupedias, et adduxit patri suo' significat desiderabilia et delectabilia 
Divino Rationali: `et dixit patri suo, Surgat pater meus, et edat e venatione filii sui' significat ut appropriaret sibi boni naturalis verum: `propterea ut benedicat mihi anima tua' significat 
ut conjungeret: `et dixit ei Jishak pater ejus, Quis tu? et dixit, Ego filius tuus, primogenitus tuus Esau' significat statum perceptionis de bono naturali et vero inde: `et horruit Jishak horrore 
magno usque valde' significat alterationem magnam circa status inversionem: `et dixit, Quis igitur ille qui venatus venationem, et adduxit mihi' significat inquisitionem de illo vero: `et edi ab omni 
antequam venisti' significat quod appropriatum: `et benedixi ei, etiam benedictus erit' significat quod conjunctum. </p>
