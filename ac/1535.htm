<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">创世记十三章经文</h4><br />1. 亚伯兰从埃及上来，他和他的妻子，并一切所有的，与罗得都往南地去。<br />2. 亚伯兰的金、银、牲畜极多。<br />3. 他根据他的旅程，从南地来到伯特利，到了伯特利和艾的中间，就是起先支搭帐棚的地方，<br />4. 也是他起初筑坛的地方，亚伯兰又在那里求告耶和华的名。<br />5. 与亚伯兰同行的罗得也有牛群、羊群、帐棚。<br />6. 那地容不下他们住在一起，因为他们的财物甚多，无法住在一起。<br />7. 亚伯兰的牧人和罗得的牧人起了纷争。那时，迦南人与比利洗人住在那地。<br />8. 亚伯兰就对罗得说，你我之间不可纷争，你的牧人和我的牧人之间也不可纷争，因为我们是兄弟。<br />9. 遍地不都在你眼前吗？请你离开我。你向左，我就向右；你向右，我就向左。<br />10. 罗得举目看见约旦河的全平原，都有水灌溉，那地在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先，如同耶和华的园子，也像你到琐珥时的埃及地。<br />11.于是罗得选择约旦河的全平原，从东边迁移；他们，就是人与他的兄弟便分离了。<br />12. 亚伯兰住在迦南地，罗得住在平原的城市，渐渐挪移帐棚，直到所多玛。<br />13. 所多玛人在耶和华面前罪大恶极。<br />14. 罗得离别亚伯兰以后，耶和华对亚伯兰说，从你所在的地方，你举目向北南东西观看，<br />15. 凡你看见的所有地，我都要赐给你和你的种，直到永远。<br />16. 我也要使你的种如同地上的尘沙，人若能数算地上的尘沙，才能数算你的种。<br />17．你起来，纵横走遍这地，因为我必把这地赐给你。<br />18. 亚伯兰就挪移帐棚，来到希伯仑幔利的橡树那里居住，在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛。<br /><h4 align="center">概览</h4><br />1535.本章论述的是要与主的内在人结合的外在人。外在人是人性本质，内在人是神性本质。前者在此由罗得来代表，后者则由亚伯兰来代表。</p><br />

And Abram went up from Egypt 钬?he and his wife and everything he had 钬?and Lot with him, toward the south.{*1} 2. And Abram was very heavy with livestock, silver, and gold.<br />3. And he went on his journeys from the south all the way to Bethel, all the way to the place where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Ai,<br />4. to the place of the altar that he had made there in the beginning; and there Abram called on Jehovah's name.<br />5. And Lot too, who went with Abram, had flock and herd and tents.<br />6. And the land could not sustain them, to [allow them to] live together, because their gain was large and they could not live together.<br />7. And there was controversy between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock. (And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then living in the land.)<br />8. And Abram said to Lot, "Please, let us not have strife between me and you, and between my herders and your herders; because we are men who are brothers.<br />9. Is the whole land not before you? Please separate from me; if [you go] to the left, I will go right; if to the right, I will go left."<br />10. And Lot raised his eyes and saw the whole plain of the Jordan, that it was all well watered (before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah), like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar.<br />11. And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan; and Lot set out from the east,{*2} and they separated, a man from his brother.{*3} 12. Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent as far as Sodom.<br />13. And the men of Sodom were very evil and sinful against Jehovah.<br />14. And Jehovah said to Abram, after Lot separated from him, "Please raise your eyes and look out from the place there where you are toward the north and toward the south and toward the east and toward the west,<br />15. because all the land that you see 钬?to you I will give it, and to your seed forever.<br />16. And I will make your seed like the dust of the earth, in that if anyone can count the dust of the earth, your seed too will be counted.<br />17. Get up; walk through the land along its length and along its breadth, because to you I will give it."<br />18. And Abram pitched his tent, and he came and lived in the oak groves of Mamre, which is in Hebron; and there he built an altar to Jehovah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1535/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_1" target=_top>Genesis 13:1</a>). Abram and Lot did not in fact go south from Egypt but northeast through the Negeb to the southern part of Canaan. The Hebrew term underlying Swedenborg's Latin here referred originally to the Negeb, but it came to mean "the south," since from the viewpoint of Jews living in Canaan, the Negeb lay in that direction. Swedenborg and his favorite Latin Bible, Schmidt 1696, render the extended meaning of the Hebrew rather than the original meaning in representing it by a Latin word for "south," meridies (on which see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1535/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458" target=_top>1458</a>). [LHC]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1535/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_11" target=_top>Genesis 13:11</a>). Swedenborg takes the Hebrew expression 诪执拽旨侄赞侄诐 (miqqe岣廵m) here to mean "from the east" (ab oriente, in the Latin), and his explanation of it in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1535/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1593" target=_top>1593</a> depends on this meaning. Lot's destination, however 钬?the Jordan valley 钬?was east of Bethel and Ai, and the Hebrew can mean "on the east," or even "toward the east," which is how most translators understand it. The same ambiguity arises in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1535/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_2" target=_top>Genesis 11:2</a> ("And it happened when they set out from the east that they found a valley in the land of Shinar"), where many translators understand the direction of travel to be toward rather than from the east. There too Swedenborg's explanation depends on a meaning of "from the east." (See 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1535/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1290" target=_top>1290</a>.)

"A man from his brother" is a Hebrew idiom for "each from the other" (讗执讬砖讈钬?钬炛底⒅纷溾€?钬愔缸椫醋欁?['卯拧 m脓钬榓l '腻岣ッ畍]). [LHC]<br />1535. Summary<br />THE present chapter deals with the Lord's outer self, which was to be united with his inner self. His outer self is his human quality; his inner self is his divine quality. The former is represented here by Lot and the latter by Abram. </p>
