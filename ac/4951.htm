<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4951节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4951.</strong>在脚后跟之下靠后一点的地方有一个地狱在深渊之处，中间的空间似乎是空的。该地狱的居民是最恶毒的，因为他们暗中查明人们作出伤害的倾向和意图，并暗中高圈套以摧毁他们。这一直是其生活的乐趣。我观察过他们好多次。他们把恶毒的毒药倒在灵人界的灵人身上，利用各种伎俩搅动他们。他们内在是恶毒的。他们看上去就像穿着斗篷，有时像是穿着其它衣服。他们经常受到惩罚，然后被下入深渊，仿佛被云层遮盖，这是从他们身上所发出的恶毒气场。有时会听见一阵骚乱从很深的地方传来，像是谋杀的声音。从那个很深的地方，有时会听到一阵骚乱，就像谋杀发生的声音。他们能将其他人感动到流泪，也能让他们感到恐惧。他们活在肉身时养成这种习惯，那时他们照料病人或简单人以获得他们的财富，哭得泪流满面，由此引起他们的怜悯。但是，他们若不能以这种方式达到自己的目的，或获得这些人的财富，就会使他们感到恐惧。他们当中大多数人都是那种利用这些方法为修道院的利益而掠夺许多家庭的人。有些也只在中间距离处出现，但他们自己觉得坐在一个屋子里彼此商议。这些也是恶毒的，只是程度不同。</p>

Under the heel, somewhat farther back, is a hell at a great depth, the intermediate space appearing empty. In this hell are the most malicious, who secretly explore minds for the purpose of doing harm, 
and secretly lay snares in order to destroy, this having been the delight of their life. I have frequently observed them; they pour out the poison of their malice to those who are in the world of spirits, 
and stir them up by various wiles. They are interiorly malicious. They appear as it were in cloaks, and sometimes otherwise. They are often punished, and are then let down to a greater depth, 
and veiled as it were with a cloud, which is the sphere of malice exhaling from them. Out of that depth at times a tumult is heard as of a slaughter. They can move others to tears, and can also strike 
terror. This habit they have acquired in the life of the body, by having been with the sick and simple for the purpose of obtaining wealth, whom they constrained to weep and so moved to pity; and if 
they did not obtain their ends in this way, they inflicted terror. They are for the most part such as in this manner plundered many houses for the benefit of monasteries. Some were also observed at a 
middle distance, but appearing to themselves to be sitting in a room and consulting together. These also are malicious, but not in the same degree. </p>

Beneath the heel and somewhat behind it a hell, at a great depth is situated, with the intervening space seemingly empty. The inhabitants of that hell are most malevolent, for secretly they discover 
people's inclinations with the intention to do harm, and secretly lie in wait so as to destroy them. This has been the delight of their life. I have watched them quite a number of times. They pour out 
their malevolent poison on those who are in the world of spirits, and use various tricks to arouse those there. These are interiorly malevolent ones. They appear there in what look like cloaks, or occasionally 
in some other clothing. Often they are punished, when they are taken down to an even greater depth where something like a cloud is spread over them, this being the sphere of malevolence that 
emanates from them. From that very deep place an uproar, like that of murders taking place, is sometimes heard. Those spirits are able to bring others to tears, and also to strike fear into them. They 
acquired this ability during their lifetime, when they attended sick or simple people whom, to gain possession of their wealth, they drove to tears, thereby moving them to pity. But if they did not 
obtain such people's wealth in this way, those spirits then struck fear into them. The majority of them are the kind who used these methods to plunder many houses for the benefit of monasteries. Some 
could also be seen only half the distance away; these seemed to themselves to be sitting in a room in consultation with one another. These too are malevolent, but not in the same degree. </p>

Sub calcaneo aliquanto magis retrorsum, est profunde infernum; spatium intermedium apparet sicut vacuum; ibi sunt malitiosissimi; clandestine explorant animos nocendi causa, et clandestine insidiantur 
ut perdant; hoc illis jucundum vitae fuerat; saepius illos observavi; effundunt venenum malitiae suae ad illos qui in mundo spirituum sunt; et illos qui ibi, variis dolis excitant; sunt interiores 
malitiosi; apparent ibi quasi in palliis, et quandoque aliter; saepe puniuntur, et tunc profundius demittuntur, et obvelantur quasi nube, quae est sphaera malitiae ex illis exhalans; ex profundo 
illo quandoque tumultus sicut internecinus auditur.  Possunt inducere alios ad lacrimandum, et quoque possunt incutere timorem; hoc imbuerunt in vita corporis per id quod apud aegrotos et simplices 
fuerint, opes obtinendi causa, quos adegerunt ad lacrimandum et sic moverunt ad misericordiam, et si non ita obtinuerunt {5}, incusserunt timorem; sunt plerique tales, qui ita pro monasteriis 
depraedati sunt plures domos.  Observati etiam quidam sunt in media distantia, sed hi apparent sibi sedere sicut in camera et consultare; sunt quoque malitiosi, sed non in illo gradu {2}. @1 aliter$ @2
