Verse 10. And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he was to her as a son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the waters. "And the child grew," 
signifies that there was increase from good; "and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter," signifies the affection of memory-knowledges; "and he was to her as a son," signifies that from this it had 
the first truths; "and she called his name Moses," signifies the quality of the state then; "and said, Because I drew him out of the waters," signifies deliverance from falsities. </p>

Verse 10. And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he was a son to her. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water. </p>
<p>'And the child grew' 
means that an increase was brought about by good. 'And she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter' means an affection for factual knowledge. 'And he was a son to her' means that then first truths were attached 
to that affection. 'And she called his name Moses' means the essential nature of the state then. 'And said, Because I drew him out of the water' means a deliverance from falsities.  </p>

Vers. 10.  Et crevit natus, et adduxit illum filiae Pharaonis, et fuit ei in filium, et vocavit nomen illius Moscheh, et dixit, Quia ex aquis eduxi illum.  `Et crevit natus' significat quod incrementum 
a bono: `et adduxit illum filiae Pharaonis' significat affectionem scientificorum: `et fuit ei in filium' significat quod inde ei vera prima: `et vocavit nomen ejus Moscheh' significat quale status 
tunc: `et dixit; Quia ex aquis eduxi illum' significat liberationem a falsis. </p>
