<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6225节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6225.</strong>“以色列就勉强”表通过属灵良善所获得的新能力。这从“勉强”的含义和“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“勉强”是指获得新的能力；“以色列”是指来自属世层的属灵良善（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>，<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）。新能力之所以通过属灵良善而来，是因为刚才雅各还被叫作“雅各”，但现在却被叫作“以色列”；经上说“有人告诉雅各说，看哪，你儿子约瑟到你这里来了。以色列就勉强”。因为“以色列”是来自属世层的属灵良善；而“雅各”是指属世层的真理；属世层的真理，即那里的信之真理通过属灵良善，即仁之良善得到强化。“以色列”也指教会的内在，“雅各”则指教会的外在（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4292.htm">4292</a>，<a href="4570.htm">4570</a>节）。教会的外在从它的内在，而非其它地方被强化并获得自己的能力。那些处于仁之良善，即信之良善，也就是真理之良善，同样是属灵良善，即“以色列”的人便处于教会的内在；而那些处于信之真理的人则处于教会的外在。他们尚未明显处于良善；然而，他们所处的真理含有良善在里面；这真理就是“雅各”。</p>

And Israel strengthened himself. That this signifies new forces through spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "strengthening himself," as being to receive new forces; and from the representation 
of Israel, as being spiritual good from the natural (see n. 4286, 4598, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833). That it is through spiritual good, is because in what immediately precedes, 
Jacob is called "Jacob," and here "Israel," for it is said, "One told Jacob, and said, Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee; and Israel strengthened himself;" for "Israel" is spiritual good 
from the natural; but "Jacob" is the truth of the natural; and the truth of the natural, which is of faith there, is confirmed (or strengthened) by means of spiritual good, which is the good of charity. 
"Israel" is also the internal of the church, and "Jacob" its external (see n. 4286, 4292, 4570). The external of the church is strengthened and receives forces from no other source than its internal. 
In the internal of the church are they who are in the good of charity, which is the good of faith, and also the good of truth, and likewise spiritual good, which are "Israel;" but in the external of 
the church are they who are in the truth of faith, and not as yet manifestly in good, but in whose truth there is nevertheless good; this truth is "Jacob." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6225</b></p><p><b>6225.</b>
'And Israel strengthened himself' means new powers received through spiritual good. This is clear from the meaning of 'strengthening oneself' as receiving new powers; and from the representation of 'Israel' 
as spiritual good from the natural, dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4598.htm">4598</a>, <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>. The reason the new powers come through spiritual good is that in what has just been 
said Jacob is called Jacob but now he is called Israel; for this is what is said,  </p>
<p>[Someone] told Jacob and said, Behold, your son Joseph has come to you; and Israel strengthened himself. </p>
<p>For 
'Israel' is spiritual good from the natural, whereas 'Jacob' is the truth of the natural, and the truth of the natural, which is the truth of faith there, receives its strength through spiritual good, 
which is the good of charity. Also, 'Israel' is the internal aspect of the Church and 'Jacob' its external aspect, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4292.htm">4292</a>, <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>. The external aspect of the Church derives its strength and receives 
its powers from nowhere else than its internal. The internal aspect of the Church exists among those governed by the good of charity, which is the good of faith, also the good of truth, and spiritual 
good as well, which are 'Israel'. But the external aspect of the Church exists among those governed by the truth of faith. They are not yet plainly governed by good; yet the truth they are governed 
by holds good within it, and this is 'Jacob'. </p>

`Et confirmavit se Israel':  quod significet novas vires per bonum spirituale, constat ex significatione `confirmare se' quod sit accipere novas vires; et ex repraesentatione `Israelis' quod sit bonum 
spirituale e naturali, de qua n. 4286, 4598, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833; quod sit per bonum spirituale, est quia Jacob in mox praecedentibus dicitur Jacob et hic Israel, dicitur 
enim `Indicavit Jacobo, et dixit, Ecce filius tuus Josephus venit ad te, et confirmavit se Israel'; `Israel' enim est bonum spirituale e naturali, `Jacob' autem est verum naturalis, et verum naturalis 
quod est fidei ibi, confirmatur per bonum spirituale quod est bonum charitatis; `Israel' etiam est internum Ecclesiae et `Jacob' {1}externum ejus, n. 4286, 4292, 4570; externum Ecclesiae nec aliunde 
confirmatur et vires accipit quam ab interno ejus; in interno Ecclesiae sunt qui in bono charitatis, quod est bonum fidei, tum {2} bonum veri, ut et bonum spirituale, quae sunt `Israel'; in externo autem 
sunt qui in vero fidei, et nondum manifeste in bono {3}sunt, sed quorum tamen in vero est bonum, hoc est `Jacob'. @1 i est$ @2 i quoque$ @3 ejus$ </p>
