<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>568.</strong>“众女”表诸如构成那人意愿之类的事物，因而表恶欲，这一点从前文有关“众子与众女”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.4.htm">5:4</a>）所述明显可知，“众子”表真理，“众女”表良善。“众女”或良善属于意愿，但人的秉性如何，其觉知如何，人的意愿如何，“众子与众女”就如何。此处所说的人已经堕落，没有意愿，取而代之的只有恶欲，他以为这就是意愿，也如此称谓。属性是由它所归属的事物的性质决定的，如前所述，此处众女所归属的人是堕落的那一类。之所以“众女”表构成意愿的事物，且没有良善的意愿，只有恶欲，以及“众子”表觉知的事物，且没有对真理的觉知，只有幻想，其原因在于，女性的性情和构成就是这样，即她们的意愿或恶欲胜过觉知。她们的每根纤维都朝着那个方向运转，这是她们的天性。因此，这二者的婚姻就象人的意愿与觉知的婚姻；由于如今没有良善的意愿，只有恶欲，而觉知之物或理智尚有可能存在，所以犹太教会针对丈夫的特权和妻子的顺服制定了很多律例。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]568.</strong> The symbolism of daughters as what resides in the will of such a person, and so as cravings, is clear from statements made about sons and daughters, and evidence offered, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_4" target=_top>4</a> of the last chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489" target=_top>489-491</a>]. Sons were there shown to symbolize truth, and daughters goodness. Daughters, or goodness, belong to the will. But our character determines what our intellect and will are like and so what our "sons and daughters" are like. The current chapter is describing corrupted people, who have no will but raw desire instead, which they consider to be will, and which they also call will. Any feature attributed to a thing has its quality from that thing, and the people said to have these daughters were corrupt, as already shown [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_562" target=_top>562-563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565" target=_top>565</a>].<br />[2] Daughters symbolize what is in the will, and when there is no will for good, they symbolize appetites; sons symbolize what is in the intellect, and when there is no comprehension of truth, they symbolize delusions. The reason for this lies in the nature of the sexes. The female sex is such by character and formation that the will or desire rules over the intellect. Every fiber in the female body is attuned to this, and it is the feminine nature. The male sex, on the other hand, is formed in such a way that intellect or reason reigns supreme. Every fiber in the male body is attuned to this, and it is the masculine nature. Marriage between the sexes results from these circumstances, as does a union between will and intellect in every individual.{*1} Today no will for good exists but desire instead — and yet a modicum of intellect or rationality is possible. This is why so many laws about men's privileges and wives' submission were laid down in the Jewish church.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a discussion of Swedenborg's attitudes toward gender, see the reader's guide, pages 55-56. [JSR]<br />{*2} The chief instance of the relationship described here, in which the male is privileged and the female submits to his direction, can be found in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_16" target=_top>Genesis 3:16</a>, when Jehovah tells the woman, "Your obedience will be to your husband; and he will rule over you." But Swedenborg is probably also referring to laws in which the lower status of women is merely implicit. See, for example, the tenth commandment (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/bible_king-james-version_exodus_20_17" target=_top>Exodus 20:17</a>), "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife or male slave or female slave or ox or donkey or anything that is your neighbor's," where a wife is included among a list of possessions; or <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_15_19-33" target=_top>Leviticus 15:19-33</a>, where menstruation is described in the same terms of uncleanliness as the discharge of an infection; or <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568/bible_king-james-version_numbers_5_11-31" target=_top>Numbers 5:11-31</a>, which repeatedly speaks of a wife as subject to her husband's authority.

That "daughters" signify such things as are of the will of that man, consequently cupidities, is evident from what was said and shown concerning "sons and daughters" in the preceding chapter (Gen. 5:4), 
where "sons" signify truths, and "daughters" goods. "Daughters" or goods, are of the will, but such as a man is, such is his understanding and such his will, thus such are the "sons and daughters." 
The present passage treats of man in a corrupt state, who has no will, but mere cupidity instead of will, which is supposed by him to be will, and is also so called. What is predicated is in accordance 
with the quality of the thing whereof it is predicated, and that the man of whom the daughters are here predicated was a corrupt man, has been shown before. The reason why "daughters" signify the 
things of the will, and, where there is no will of good, cupidities; and why "sons" signify the things of the understanding, and, where there is no understanding of truth, phantasies, is that the female 
sex is such, and so formed, that the will or cupidity reigns in them more than the understanding. Such is the entire disposition of their fibers, and such their nature, whereas the male sex is so formed 
that the intellect or reason rules, such also being the disposition of their fibers and such their nature. Hence the marriage of the two is like that of the will and the understanding in every man; 
and since at this day there is no will of good, but only cupidity, and still something intellectual, or rational, can be given, this is why so many laws were enacted in the Jewish Church concerning 
the prerogative of the husband [vir], and the obedience of the wife. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 568</b></p><p><b>568.</b>
'Daughters' means the things that constituted the will of that man, and so means evil desires. This is clear from what has been stated and shown about sons and daughters at verse 4 of the previous chapter, 
where 'sons' meant truths and 'daughters' goods. 'Daughters' or goods constitute the will. But as is a person's character so is his understanding and his will, and so therefore his 'sons and daughters'. 
At the moment the subject is the corrupt human type who has no will but merely evil desire instead, which people imagine to be the will and actually call the will. For any attribute is determined 
by the nature of the subject to which it is attributed. As shown already, the human type to whom 'daughters' are attributed here is a corrupt type.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason 'daughters' means things constituting 
the will, which are evil desires when the will for good is non-existent, while 'sons' means those constituting the understanding, which are delusions when the understanding of truth is non-existent, 
is that the female disposition and make-up is such that the will or evil desire reigns rather than understanding. Every one of their fibres runs in that direction; and it is their very nature. 
The male make-up however is such that the understanding or reason reigns; every one of their fibres too runs in that direction, and it is their very nature. Consequently the marriage of the two sexes 
is like that of the will and the understanding in the individual. And because nowadays the will for good does not exist, but only evil desire, when yet it is possible for something of the understanding 
or reason to exist, so many laws were for that reason laid down in the Jewish Church concerning the husband's rights and the wife's obedience.

Quod 'filiae' significent quae sunt voluntatis istius hominis, proinde cupiditates, constat ab illis quae de filiis et filiabus dicta et ostensa sunt, cap. praec. ad vers. 4, ubi significarunt 'filii' 
vera et 'filiae' bona; 'filiae' seu bona, sunt voluntatis; sed qualis homo, talis intellectus et talis voluntas, ita tales 'filii et filiae'; hic agitur de homine corrupto, cui voluntas nulla sed pro 
voluntate mera cupiditas quam putant, et quam quoque vocant, voluntatem; quod praedicatur, se habet secundum qualitatem ejus de quo praedicatur; quod homo sit corruptus homo, prius ostensum, de quo 
praedicantur 'filiae.' [2] Quod 'filiae' significent quae sunt voluntatis, et cum nulla voluntas boni, quod cupiditates, et quod 'filii' significent quae sunt intellectus, et cum nullus intellectus veri, 
quod phantasias, causa est quod sexus femininus talis sit et ita formatus ut voluntas seu cupiditas regnet prae intellectu; talis est omnis dispositio earum fibrarum, talis earum natura: at sexus 
masculinus ita formatus est ut intellectus seu ratio regnet; talis quoque est dispositio eorum fibrarum, talis eorum natura; inde conjugium utriusque, sicut est voluntatis et intellectus in unoquovis 
homine: et quia nulla hodie voluntas boni sed cupiditas, et usque intellectuale quid seu rationale dari queat, inde est quod tot leges in Ecclesia Judaica latae sint de praerogativa viri et oboedientia uxoris. </p>
