<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>96.</strong>至于“耶和华将生气吹在他鼻孔里”，情况如下：在古代，并在圣经中，“鼻孔”意味着可喜的芳香，芳香象征觉知。因此，经上常说耶和华从燔祭或象征主及其国之物“闻到馨香之气”。对主而言，最为可喜的是爱与信，故经上说：“耶和华将生气吹在他鼻孔里。”<br />耶和华的受膏者，亦即主的受膏者，也因此被称为“鼻中的气”（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.20.htm">4:20</a>）。主也向门徒“吹气”，如经上记着说：“说了这话，就向他们吹一口气，说，你们受圣灵。”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.22.htm">20:22</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]96.</strong> It says that Jehovah God blew in through the person's nostrils. In ancient times and in the Word, nostrils meant anything that was pleasing, from the idea of fragrance, which symbolizes perception. In many places, therefore, we read that Jehovah smelled a restful smell from the burnt offerings and from other offerings representing himself and his kingdom.{*1} Since he finds the various aspects of love and faith most pleasing, the text says that he blew the breath of lives in through the nostrils.<br />For this reason Jehovah's anointed — the Lord — is called the breath [or spirit] of the nostrils (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_96/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_4_20" target=_top>Lamentations 4:20</a>).{*2} The Lord conveyed the same idea by breathing on the disciples, as John reports:<br />He breathed on them and said, "Receive the holy spirit." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_96/bible_king-james-version_john_20_22" target=_top>John 20:22</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Jehovah's smelling a restful smell, see the passages cited in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_96/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925" target=_top>925:1</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} The Latin word here translated "breath [or spirit]" is spiritus, a single word that means both breath and spirit, as does the Hebrew word in Lamentations (רוּחַ [rûaḥ]). The bracketed material is inserted here because English lacks a word that simultaneously implies both. See also note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_96/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97" target=_top>97</a>. [LHC] </p>

As to its being said that "Jehovah God breathed into his nostrils" the case is this: In ancient times, and in the Word, by "nostrils" was understood whatever was grateful in consequence of its odor, 
which signifies perception. On this account it is repeatedly written of Jehovah, that He "smelled an odor of rest" from the burnt-offerings, and from those things which represented Him and His kingdom; 
and as the things relating to love and faith are most grateful to Him, it is said that "He breathed through his nostrils the breath of lives." Hence the anointed of Jehovah, that is, of the Lord, is 
called the "breath of the nostrils" (Lam. 4:20). And the Lord Himself signified the same by "breathing on His disciples" as written in John: </p>
<p>     He breathed on them and said, Receive ye the Holy Spirit 
(John 20:22). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 96</b></p><p><b>96.</b>
The implications of the statement that Jehovah God 'breathed into his nostrils' are as follows: In ancient times, and in the Word, the nostrils meant something that was pleasing by virtue of its odour, 
which means perception Consequently one reads many times of Jehovah 'smelling an odour of rest' from burnt offerings and from the things which represented Him and His kingdom. And since matters of 
love and faith are most pleasing to Him, it is said that He breathed the breath of life' through his nostrils. This is why Jehovah's Anointed, who is the Lord, is called 'the-Breath-of-nostrils', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:20</a>. And this was what the Lord Himself meant by breathing on His disciples, in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He breathed and said, Receive the Holy Spirit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:22</a>.

</p><b>96.</b>
Quod dicatur Jehovah Deus 'per nares inspiravisse,' ita se res habet: antiquitus et in Verbo per 'nares' intellectum quicquid gratum erat ex odore, qui significat perceptionem; quare passim legitur 
de Jehovah quod 'odorem quietis odoratus' ex holocaustis, et ex illis quae Ipsum et regnum Ipsius repraesentabant; et quia Ipsi gratissima sunt quae amoris et fidei, dicitur quod 'spiraculum vitarum inspiraverit 
per nares': inde Unctus Jehovae, seu Dominus, vocatur 'Spiritus narium,' Thren. iv 20: et Ipse Dominus significabat hoc per inspirationem discipulis, apud Johannem, 	Inspiravit et dixit, 
Accipe spiritum sanctum, xx 22.
