<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1254节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1254.</strong>“这些都是挪亚儿子的宗族”表古教会的具体敬拜形式。这从“宗族”和“儿子的宗族”的含义清楚看出来，“宗族”表敬拜的形式，事实上表具体的敬拜形式。本章前几节所提到的民族没有别的含义，只表古教会的各种敬拜形式，因此组成民族的“宗族”也没有其它意思。就内义而言，所表示的是属灵和属天之物，而非其它宗族。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1254.</strong> The symbolism of these are the clans of Noah's sons, as the specific ways in which the ancient church worshiped can be seen from the symbolism of a clan, and of a clan of sons, as ways to worship and in fact as specific types of worship.<br />The nations named in the earlier parts of this chapter only symbolized various ways in which the ancient church worshiped, so the clans that composed the nations cannot have any other meaning. The inner sense cannot be referring to any other clans than those of spiritual and heavenly traits. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1254</b></p><p><b>1254.</b>
These are the families of the sons of Noah. That this signifies the worships of the Ancient Church in particular, is evident from the signification of a "family," and of "the families of the sons," as 
being worships, and in fact the species of the worships. The nations named in the preceding verses of this chapter signify nothing else than various worships of the Ancient Church, and therefore the 
families of which the nations consisted must signify the same. In the internal sense no other families can be meant than those of things spiritual and celestial.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1254</b></p><p><b>1254.</b>
That 'these are the families of the sons of Noah' means the forms of worship of the Ancient Church in particular is clear from the meaning of 'families' and of 'families of sons' as forms of worship, 
and indeed specific forms of worship. The nations mentioned in previous verses of this chapter have meant nothing other than various forms of worship in the Ancient Church and therefore 'the families' 
which composed the nations can have no other meaning. In the internal sense no other families than those of spiritual and celestial things can possibly be meant. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1254</b>
</p><b>1254.</b>
'Hae familiae filiorum Noahi':  quod significent cultus Ecclesiae Antiquae in particulari, constat a significatione 'familiae et familiae filiorum' quod sint cultus, et quidem quod species cultuum: 
 in praecedentibus hujus capitis gentes nominatae nihil aliud significarunt quam varios Ecclesiae Antiquae cultus, quare 'familiae' ex quibus gentes constabant, nec possunt aliud significare; in sensu 
interno nusquam intelligi queunt aliae familiae quam spiritualium et caelestium. </p>
