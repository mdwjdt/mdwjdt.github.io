<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9738节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9738.</strong>“要用空心板作坛”表适用。这从“空心板”的含义清楚可知，“空心板”当论及要在其上焚烧燔祭、献上祭牲脂油的祭坛时，是指适用，因为祭坛是一个空心板，故适用于这种功用或目的。因此，就那些属于源于爱之良善的对主的敬拜，由祭坛和坛上的燔祭并祭牲所代表的事物而言，也表示适用（参看<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9738</b></p><p><b>9738.</b>
Hollow of boards shalt thou make it. That this signifies application, is evident from the signification of "hollow of boards," when said of the altar on which the burnt-offerings were to be burned and 
the fat things of the sacrifices were to be offered, as being application; for the altar was thereby rendered applicable to this use. Consequently there is also signified application in respect to those 
things which belong to the worship of the Lord from the good of love, which were represented by the altar, and by the burnt-offerings and sacrifices upon it (see n. 9714). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9738</b></p><p><b>9738.</b>
'A boarded hollow you shall make it' means the suitableness. This is clear from the meaning of 'a boarded hollow', used in reference to the altar on which the burnt offerings were to be burned and the 
fat of sacrifices was to be offered, as the suitableness, for by being a boarded hollow the altar was rendered suitable to that purpose. Therefore also the suitableness is meant of those things which 
belong to worship of the Lord that springs from the good of love, which were represented by the altar and by the burnt offerings and sacrifices offered upon it, <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9738</b>
</p><b>9738.</b>
`Cavum tabulatum facies illud': quod significet applicationem, constat ex significatione `cavi tabulati' cum de altari, super quo comburerentur holocausta, et adolerentur pinguia sacrificiorum, quod 
sit applicatio, nam altare per id (o)ad eum usum applicabile reddebatur; inde quoque significatur applicatio quoad illa quae sunt cultus Domini ex bono amoris, quae repraesentabantur per altare, et per 
holocausta et sacrificia super illo, n. 9714. </p>
