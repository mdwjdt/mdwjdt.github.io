Verses 11-15. And Pharaoh saw that there was breathing, and he made heavy his heart, and heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite 
the dust of the land, and it shall become lice in all the land of Egypt. And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the land, and there was louse on man 
and on beast; all the dust of the land became louse in all the land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with their enchantments, to bring forth lice, and they could not; and there was louse on man and 
on beast. And the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God; and Pharaoh's heart was made firm, and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken. "And Pharaoh saw that there was breathing," 
signifies that the weariness ceased; "and he made heavy his heart," signifies obstinacy; "and he heard them not," signifies no obedience; "as Jehovah had spoken," signifies according to the prediction; 
"and Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction anew; "Say unto Aaron," signifies the influx of the internal law into the external law; "stretch out thy rod," signifies that he should show Divine 
power; "and smite the dust of the land," signifies that he should remove the things in the natural that had been damned; "and it shall become lice," signifies that evils will rise up therefrom; "in 
all the land of Egypt," signifies through the whole natural mind; "and they did so," signifies the effect; "and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod," signifies the power of internal truth through 
external truth; "and smote the dust of the land," signifies that things damned were removed; "and there was lice on man and on beast," signifies the interior and exterior evils of cupidities thence 
derived; "all the dust of the land became louse in all the land of Egypt," signifies that these evils were from the things that had been damned; "and the magicians did so with their enchantments, to 
bring forth lice," signifies an endeavor to pervert Divine order, and to portray the like in these things also; "and they could not," signifies in vain; "and there was louse on man and on beast," signifies 
the interior and exterior evils of cupidities; "and the magicians said unto Pharaoh," signifies perception and its communication with those who were in evils; "This is the finger of God," signifies 
that the power was from the Divine; "and Pharaoh's heart was made firm," signifies obstinacy; "and he heard them not," signifies disobedience; "as Jehovah had spoken," signifies according to the prediction. </p>

And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod 
and strike the dust of the land, and it will then be lice in all the land of Egypt. And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the land, and there were lice 
on man and on beast. All the dust of the land became lice in the whole land of Egypt. And the magicians did the same with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not; and there were lice 
on man and on beast. And the magicians said to Pharaoh, The finger of God is this. And Pharaoh's heart was unyielding, and he did not hear' them, as Jehovah had spoken. </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh saw that he 
could breathe again' means that the weariness ceased. 'And he made his heart stubborn' means obstinacy. 'And did not hear them' means disobedience. 'As Jehovah had spoken' means as accorded with what 
had been foretold. 'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instruction anew. 'Say to Aaron' means an influx of inward law into outward law. 'Stretch out your rod' means commanding him to demonstrate the Divine 
power. 'And strike the dust of the land' means that he should remove those things in the natural which are damned. 'And it will then be lice' means that evils will rise up from them. 'In all the 
land of Egypt' means in the whole natural mind. 'And they did so' means putting it into effect. 'And Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod' means the power of inward truth directed through outward 
truth. 'And struck the dust of the land' means that the things which were damned were removed. 'And there were lice on man and on beast' means that evils rose up from those things - interior and exterior 
evils attached to wicked desires. 'All the dust of the land became lice in the whole land of Egypt' means that those evils rose up from the things that were damned. 'And the magicians did the same 
with their enchantments to bring forth lice' means the endeavour to pervert Divine order and produce something that looked the same in these things also. 'But they could not' means that they acted to 
no avail. 'And there were lice on man and on beast' means the evils, interior and exterior, that are attached to wicked desires. 'And the magicians said to Pharaoh' means perception and communication 
of it to those immersed in evils. 'The finger of God is this' means that the power came from the Divine. 'And Pharaoh's heart was unyielding' means obstinacy. 'And he did not hear them' means disobedience. 
'As Jehovah had spoken' means as accorded with what had been foretold.

Vers. 11-15.  Et vidit Pharao quod facta respiratio, et aggravavit cor suum, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Dic ad Aharonem, Extende baculum tuum, 
et percute pulverem terrae, et erit in pediculos in omni terra Aegypti.  Et fecerunt ita, et extendit Aharon manum suam baculo suo, et percussit pulverem terrae, et fuit pediculus in homine et in bestia; 
omnis pulvis terrae factus est pediculus in tota terra Aegypti.  Et fecerunt ita magi incantationibus suis ad educendum pediculos, et non potuerunt; et fuit pediculus in homine et in bestia.  Et 
dixerunt magi ad Pharaonem, Digitus Dei hoc; et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah.  `Et vidit Pharao quod facta respiratio' significat quod taedium cessaverit:

ita' significat effectum: `et extendit Aharon manum suam baculo suo' significat potentiam veri interni per verum externam: `et percussit pulverem terrae' significat quod emoverentur damnata: `et fuit 
pediculus in homine et in bestia' significat quod mala interiora et exteriora cupiditatum inde: `omnis pulvis terrae factus est pediculus in tota terra Aegypti' significat quod illa ex damnatis: `et 
fecerunt ita magi incantationibus suis ad educendum pediculos' significat conatum pervertendi ordinem Divinum et effigiandi simile in his quoque: `et non potuerunt' significat quod incassum: `et fuit 
pediculus in homine et in bestia' significat mala interiora et exteriora cupiditatum: `et dixerunt magi ad Pharaonem' significat perceptionem et ejus communicationem cum illis qui in malis: `Digitus 
Dei hoc' significat quod potentia ex Divino esset: `et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis' significat obstinationem: `et non audivit ad illos' significat non oboedientiam: `quemadmodum locutus Jehovah' significat
