<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第152节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>152.</strong>不难看出，女人不是男人的肋骨造成的，此处想必隐藏着人未曾发现的奥秘。对于“女人”表人的自我，这从被欺骗的是女人这一事实可知。因为人无非是被自我欺骗，亦即被我欲和物欲所欺骗。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]152.</strong> If you give it even a little thought, you can see that woman did not come from the rib of man and that these words involve deeper secrets than have ever yet come to light. The fact that the woman symbolizes selfhood is indicated by her being the one who was deceived [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_152/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_1-6" target=_top>Genesis 3:1-6</a>], since nothing ever deceives us besides our self-absorption or, what is the same, love for ourselves and for the material world. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 152</b></p><p><b>152.</b>
It requires but little attention in anyone to discern that woman was not formed out of the rib of a man, and that deeper arcana are here implied than any person has heretofore been aware of. And that 
by the "woman" is signified man's Own, may be known from the fact that it was the woman who was deceived; for nothing ever deceives man but his Own, or what is the same, the love of self and of the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 152</b></p><p><b>152.</b>
Anyone paying the matter only scant attention may see that woman was not formed out of the rib of a man, and that the arcana embodied here are deeper than anybody has ever been aware of up to now. And 
that the proprium is meant by 'the woman may be seen from the consideration that the woman was the one who was deceived, for nothing but the proprium - or what amounts to the same, self-love and love 
of the world - ever deceives a person.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 152</b>
</p><b>152.</b>
Quisque qui modo leviter attendit, scire potest quod non mulier ex costa viri, et quod haec arcaniora involvant quam usquam aliquis hactenus noverit; et quod proprium per mulierem significetur ex eo 
quod mulier sit quae decepta, nam nihil nusquam hominem decipit quam proprium, seu quod idem est, amor sui et mundi. </p>
