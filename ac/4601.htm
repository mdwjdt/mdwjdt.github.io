<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4601.</strong>“流便去与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝”表通过与仁分离之信而对良善的亵渎；“以色列也听见这事”表这信被弃绝。这从“流便”的代表，以及“与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝”和“以色列听见”的含义清楚可知：“流便”是指存在于教义和理解中的信，也就是教会头生之物或属性（参看<a href="3861.htm">3861</a>，<a href="3866.htm">3866</a>节），在此是指与仁分离之信，如下文所述；“与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝”是指对良善的亵渎，因为“犯奸淫”表示败坏或玷污良善（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节），但“与父亲的妾同寝”是指亵渎它们；“以色列听见”是指这信被弃绝。“以色列听见”在本来意义上表示属灵教会知道这信，并同意它；因为“听见”表示倾听，而 “以色列”表示属灵教会。但真正的教会并不同意它，这一点从将要论及流便的话明显可知。但就内义而言，意思是说，这信被弃绝，因为经上虽然没有说雅各对这种难以启齿的恶行的感受和想法，但他对流便的极度反感和憎恶从他关于流便的预言明显看出来：<br />流便哪，你是我的长子，是我的力量、我能力的开始，本当大有尊荣，权力超众；但你如水变化无常，必不得超越，因为你上了你父亲的床；上了我的榻，污秽了它。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.3.htm">49:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这种反感和憎恶从流便因此失去长子的名分（历代志上<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上5.1.htm">5:1</a>）也明显看出来。由此明显可知，“以色列听见”表示这信被弃绝。“长子名分”表示教会的信仰（参看<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="2435.htm">2435</a>，<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>节）。<br />当人们承认并相信教会的真理及其良善，却过着违背它们的生活时，因与仁分离之信而对良善的亵渎就会发生。因为对那些在理解和由此而来的生活中将信之物与仁之物分离的人来说，邪恶与真理联结，虚假与良善联结；这种联结本身就是那被称为亵渎的。而那些尽管知道何为信之真理与良善，却仍不发自内心相信的人则不然。可参看前面有关亵渎的阐述和说明（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>，<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="1003.htm">1003</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>，<a href="4050.htm">4050</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>节）；以及因与仁分离之信而对良善的亵渎由该隐杀死亚伯、含被父亲诅咒、埃及人被红海吞没（<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>节）和此处的流便（<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="3870.htm">3870</a>节）来代表。<br />为了属灵教会的成员能得救，主奇迹般地将其心智的理解力部分从意愿部分分离出来，并将接受一个新意愿的能力赋予理解力（<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="928.htm">928</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>，<a href="4328.htm">4328</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）。因此，当理解力掌握并领悟信之真理与良善，并将这些变成自己的，而此人的意愿，也就是他对行恶的意愿，仍掌权统治时，真理就来与邪恶联结，良善则来与虚假联结。真理与邪恶并良善与虚假的这种联结就是亵渎，由圣餐中不配吃喝来表示。圣体所表示的良善与宝血所表示的真理无法从这样的人那里被分离出去；因为当这些事物以这种方式与虚假并邪恶联结时，它们永远不可能被分离出去；故最深的地狱在等着这些人。但那些知道何为信之真理与良善，却并未发自内心相信的人，如今当今大多数人的情形，不可能亵渎它们，因为理解力没有接受它们，并将其吸收到自己里面。<br />此处论述的主题就是这种分离之信，因为接下来论述的是处于其纯正次序的真理与良善，之后紧接着是它们与理性或理解力部分的联结。再紧接着以名字所提及的“雅各的儿子”是指处于其纯正次序的真理与良善，“以色列”是指理性或理解力部分。雅各及其儿子来到以撒那里在内义上是指与理解力部分的这种联结。</p>

That Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. That this signifies the profanation of good by means of faith separate, and that and Israel heard signifies that this faith was rejected, 
is evident from the representation of Reuben as being faith in doctrine and in understanding, which is the first thing of the church (see n. 3861, 3866), here this faith separate from charity (of which 
in what follows); and from the signification of "lying with Bilhah his father's concubine," as being the profanation of good, for "to commit adultery" signifies to pervert or adulterate goods (n. 2466, 
2729, 3399), but "to lie with a father's concubine" is to profane them; and from the signification of "Israel heard," as being that this faith was rejected. In the proper sense by Israel's hearing 
is signified that the spiritual church knew this and assented to it; for by "hearing" is signified hearkening to, and by "Israel" the spiritual church; but that the true church does not assent, will 
appear from what will be said about Reuben. But in the internal sense is signified that this faith was rejected, for it is not said what Jacob felt and thought about this nefarious deed; nevertheless 
that he utterly abominated and abhorred it, is manifest from his prophecy respecting Reuben: </p>
<p>     Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my strength, and the beginning of my might; excellent in honor, and excellent 
in power. Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel, who wentest up thy father's bed, then profanedst thou it, he went up my couch (Gen. 49:3, 4); </p>
<p>and from Reuben's being on this account deprived 
of his birthright (1 Chron. 5:1). Hence it is evident that by "Israel heard" is signified that this faith was rejected. (That "birthright" is the faith of the church may be seen above, n. 352, 2435, 
3325.)  [2] The profanation of good is effected by faith separate when the truth of the church and its good are acknowledged and believed, and yet the man lives contrary to them. For with those who 
separate the things of faith from those of charity in the understanding and thence in life, evil is conjoined with truth and falsity with good; and this conjunction itself is what is called profanation. 
It is otherwise with those, who, although they know what the truth and good of faith are, still do not at heart believe. (See what has been said and shown before on profanation, n. 301-303, 571, 582, 
593, 1001, 1003, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3399, 3402, 3489, 3898, 4050, 4289; also that the profanation of good by faith separate was represented by Cain's killing Abel; by 
Ham's being cursed by his father; and by the Egyptians being swallowed up by the Red Sea, n. 3325; and here also by Reuben, n. 3325, 3870). [3] In order that those who are of the spiritual church could 
be saved, the Lord miraculously separated their intellectual part from their will part, and bestowed upon the intellectual the power of receiving a new will (n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 
1044, 2256, 4328, 4493). When therefore the intellectual apprehends and perceives the good which is of faith, and appropriates it to itself, and yet man's will (that is, his willing evil) still reigns 
and commands, there is effected the conjunction of truth and evil, and of good and falsity. This conjunction is profanation, and is meant by eating and drinking unworthily in the Holy Supper, said of 
those from whom the good which is there signified by the "body," and the truth which is there signified by the "blood," cannot be separated, because things which have been conjoined in this manner can 
never be separated to all eternity, and therefore the deepest hell awaits them. But they who know what the truth and good of faith are, and yet do not at heart believe them (as is the case with most 
people at the present day), cannot profane them, because the intellectual does not receive them and imbue itself with them.  [4] It is the rejection of this separated faith that is here treated of, 
because in what presently follows truths and goods are treated of in their genuine order, and directly afterwards their conjunction with the rational or intellectual. The sons of Jacob presently named 
are truths and goods in genuine order, and Isaac is the rational or intellectual. The coming of Jacob and his sons to Isaac, is in the internal sense this conjunction with the intellectual. </p>

'That Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine' means the profanation of good by means of faith separated from charity; 'and Israel heard' means that this faith was cast aside. This is 
clear from the representation of 'Reuben' as faith present in doctrine and in the understanding, which is the attribute of the Church that is born first, dealt with in <a href="3861.htm">3861</a>, <a href="3866.htm">3866</a>, at this point when that 
faith has been separated from charity, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'lying with Bilhah his father's concubine' as the profanation of good, for committing adultery means perverting or 
adulterating forms of good, <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>, but 'lying with a father's concubine' profaning them; and from the meaning of 'Israel heard' as the fact that this faith was cast aside. In the proper sense 
the expression 'Israel heard' means that the spiritual Church knew this and assented to it, for 'hearing' means hearkening, while 'Israel' means the spiritual Church. But the fact that the true Church 
does not assent to it will be evident from what is going to be said about Reuben. In the internal sense however the meaning is that that faith was cast aside, for although Jacob's feelings and thoughts 
concerning this unmentionable and outrageous deed are not stated, his utter disgust and abhorrence is evident from his prophecy concerning Reuben, </p>
<blockquote>
Reuben, you my firstborn, are my strength and 
the beginning of my might, excelling in eminence, and excelling in power. Unstable as water, may you not excel, for you went up to your father's bed; then you profaned It. He went up to my couch. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The same is also evident from the fact that because of what he did Reuben was deprived of the birthright, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Chron%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Chron 5:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
These considerations show that 'Israel heard' means that that faith 
was cast aside. As regards the birthright meaning the faith of the Church, see <a href="352.htm">352</a>, <a href="2435.htm">2435</a>, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>.  </p>

 The profanation of good by faith separated from charity takes place when people acknowledge and 
believe the truth of the Church and its good and yet lead lives contrary to these. Indeed with those who in understanding and consequently in life separate matters of faith from those of charity, evil 
is joined to truth and falsity to good; and it is this joining together that is called profanation. The situation is different with those who, though they know what the truth and good of faith are, 
nevertheless do not in their hearts have any belief in these. See what has been stated and shown already concerning profanation in <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1001.htm">1001</a>, <a href="1003.htm">1003</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>,

and by the Egyptians when they were drowned in the Red Sea, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> as well as here by Reuben, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="3870.htm">3870</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In order that members of the spiritual Church might be saved the Lord miraculously 
separated the understanding part of their minds from the will part and imparted to the understanding the ability to accept a new will, <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="928.htm">928</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a>, <a href="4328.htm">4328</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>. When 
therefore the understanding takes hold of and perceives the [truth and] good of faith and makes these its own, and yet the person's own will - that is, his will to do evil - reigns and rules, truth 
comes to be joined to evil and good to falsity. This joining of truth to evil and of good to falsity is profanation and is meant by eating and drinking in an unworthy manner in the Holy Supper. From people 
like this the good meant by the body and the truth meant by the blood [cannot] be separated; for when these have been joined to falsity and evil as described, they cannot be separated ever at all, 
and as a consequence the deepest hell awaits those persons. But those who know what the truth and good of faith are and yet in their hearts have no belief in them, as is the case with the vast majority 
of people at the present day, are unable to profane them because the understanding does not accept them and absorb them into itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The subject here is the casting aside of this faith, for 
in what follows immediately after this the subject is truths and goods in their genuine order, and immediately after that the joining of these to the rational or understanding part, 'the sons of Jacob' 
who in the verses immediately after this are mentioned by name being truths and goods in that order, 'Isaac' the rational or understanding part, and 'Jacob's coming with his sons to Isaac' being in 
the internal sense that joining to the understanding part.
