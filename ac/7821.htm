To look above self is proper to man, but to look below self is proper to beasts. From this it follows that insofar as a man looks below himself or downward, so far he is a beast, and also so far is an 
image of hell; and that insofar as he looks above himself or upward, so far he is a man, and also so far is an image of the Lord. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 12 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron 
in the land of Egypt, saying,       2. This month is to you the head of the months; this is the first to you in the months of the year.      3. Speak ye unto all the assemblage of Israel, saying, 
In the tenth of this month they shall take to them everyone a lamb,* for the house of his fathers, a lamb for the house.      4. And if the house is too little for a lamb, then let him take he and 
his neighbor near unto his house in the number of the souls; everyone for the mouth of his eating shall ye count for the lamb.      5. A lamb unblemished, a male, a son of a year shall be for you; ye 
shall take it from the lambs and from the she-goats.      6. And it shall be for you to be kept even unto the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole congregation of the assemblage of Israel shall 
kill it between the two evenings.      7. And they shall take of the blood, and put it upon the two posts and upon the lintel, upon the houses in which they shall eat it.      8. And they shall eat 
the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and things unleavened; upon things bitter they shall eat it.      9. Eat ye not of it raw, and by boiling boiled in water, but roast with fire; its head upon 
its legs and upon its midst.      10. And ye shall not leave of it until the morning; and that which is left of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.      11. And thus shall ye eat it: your 
loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste; this is the passover of Jehovah.      12. And I will pass through the land of Egypt in that night, 
and I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man and even unto beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will do judgments: I am Jehovah.      13. And the blood shall be to you for a sign 
upon the houses where ye are; and I shall see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there shall not be in you a plague for a destroyer, when I smite the land of Egypt.      14. And this day shall 
be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah in your generations; ye shall keep it by an eternal statute.      15. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened things; even on the first 
day ye shall cause leaven to cease from your houses; for everyone that eateth what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, even that soul shall be cut off from Israel.      16. And 
there shall be for you in the first day a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no work shall be done in them, save that which every soul must eat, this only shall be done by you.  
    17. And ye shall observe the unleavened things, because in this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: and ye shall keep this day in your generations by an eternal statute.  
    18. In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened things, until the one and twentieth day of the month, in the evening.      19. Seven 
days leaven shall not be found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the assemblage of Israel, in the sojourner, and in the native of the land.  
    20. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings ye shall eat things unleavened.      21. And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw ye forth, and take you 
an animal of the flock according to your families, and kill ye the passover.      22. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and ye shall touch the lintel 
and the two posts with the blood that is in the basin; and no one of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.      23. And Jehovah will pass through to inflict a plague on Egypt; 
and He will see the blood upon the lintel, and upon the two posts, and Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come unto your houses to inflict a plague.      24. And ye 
shall keep this word for a statute to thee and to thy sons forever.      25. And it shall be that when ye shall come unto the land which Jehovah will give you, as He hath spoken, that ye shall keep this 
service.      26. And it shall be, when your sons shall say unto you, What is this service to you?      27. That ye shall say, This is the sacrifice of the passover to Jehovah, in that He passed 
over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when He inflicted a plague on Egypt, and liberated our houses. And the people bent itself, and bowed itself.      28. And the sons of Israel went and 
they did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.      29. And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to 
sit upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the house of the pit; and all the firstborn of beast.      30. And Pharaoh rose up in that night, and all his servants, and all 
the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; because there was not a house where there was not one dead.      31. And he called Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, Rise up, go ye out from 
the midst of my people, both ye and the sons of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, according to your speaking.      32. Also your flocks, also your herds, take ye, as ye spoke, and go; and bless me also.  
    33. And Egypt was strong upon the people, hastening to send them out of the land; for they said, We be all dead.      34. And the people carried their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs 
bound up in their clothes upon their shoulder.      35. And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, 
and garments.      36. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they lent to them. And they spoiled the Egyptians.      37. And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to 
Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides babe.      38. And a great mixed multitude also went up with them; and flock, and herd, a very great acquisition.      39. And they 
baked the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it had not been leavened; because they were driven out of Egypt, and could not tarry, and moreover they had not prepared 
for themselves any provision for the journey.      40. And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt was thirty years and four hundred years.      41. And it was at the end of 
the thirty years and four hundred years, even it was in this same day, all the armies of Jehovah went forth from the land of Egypt.      42. A night of watches is this to Jehovah, for leading them 
forth from the land of Egypt: this is that night of watches to Jehovah for all the sons of Israel unto their generations.      43. And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the passover: 
no son of an alien shall eat of it.      44. And every man's servant that is bought with silver, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.      45. A lodger and a hireling shall 
not eat of it.      46. In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not bring out of the flesh abroad from the house; and ye shall not break a bone in it.      47. All the assemblage of Israel shall 
perform it.      48. And when a sojourner shall sojourn with thee, and performeth the passover to Jehovah, every male of his shall be circumcised, and then let him come near to perform it; and he 
shall be as a native of the land; and no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.      49. One law shall there be for the native, and for the sojourner that sojourneth in the midst of you.      50. And 
all the sons of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.      51. And it was in this same day, that Jehovah led forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. * 
The word "lamb" here (Latin pecud-, Hebrew seh) must be understood to mean the young of both sheep and goats, as defined in verse 5, and also by Swedenborg himself in n. 8020. Thus it is either a 
lamb or a kid. We have no word in English that will precisely render either the Hebrew term or the Latin one. In verse however, the word "lambs," near the end of the verse, is agnus in the Latin, and 
keves in the Hebrew, and thus is correctly rendered "lambs." [Reviser]. </p>

Looking above self is proper to the human being, whereas looking below self is proper to beasts. It follows therefore that to the extent that a person looks below himself or downwards he is a beast, 
and also an image of hell; but to the extent that he looks above himself or upwards he is a human being, and also an image of the Lord. </p>

<OL><!--IN-LI--> <LI value='1'> And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron in the 
land of Egypt - He said,  <LI value='2'> This month shall be for you the head of months; the first shall it be for you in the months of the year. <LI value='3'> Speak to all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this 
month they shall take for themselves each one a member of the flock according to the household of his fathers, a member of the flock according to the household. <LI value='4'> And if the household is too small 
for a member of the flock, let him and his neighbour immediately next to his house take one, by the number of the souls; each of them according to the mouth of his eating, you shall make your count for 
the member of the flock. <LI value='5'> A perfect member, a male, the son of a year it shall be to you; from the lambs and from the she-goats you shall take it. <LI value='6'> And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day 
of this month; and all the congregation of the assembly of Israel shall slaughter it between the evenings. <LI value='7'> And they shall take some of the blood and put it onto the two doorposts and onto the lintel, 
on the houses in which they will eat it. <LI value='8'> And they shall eat the flesh on that night; roasted with fire, and [with] unleavened bread on bitter herbs, they shall eat it. <LI value='9'> Do not eat any of it 
raw, nor boiled at all in water, but roasted indeed with fire, its head over its legs and over its middle. <LI value='10'> And you shall not leave any of it until the morning; and what does remain of it until the 
morning you shall burn with fire. <LI value='11'> And thus you shall eat it: Your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your rod in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste; it is a Passover to Jehovah. <LI value='12'> 
And I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man (homo) even to beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will make judgements. I am 
Jehovah. <LI value='13'> And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass you by, and the plague will not be on you for the destroyer, when I strike the land of 
Egypt. <LI value='14'> And that day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah, throughout your generations; you shall keep it as a feast by an eternal statute. <LI value='15'> Seven days you 
shall eat unleavened bread; even on the first day you shall remove<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> yeast from your houses, for anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off from Israel, from the first day until 
the seventh day. <LI value='16'> And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you. No work shall be done on them; only what must be eaten 
by every soul, this alone shall be done by you. <LI value='17'> And you shall observe [the feast of] unleavened bread, for on this same day I have brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; and you shall observe 
this day throughout your generations by an eternal statute.  <LI value='18'> In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of 
the month in the evening. <LI value='19'> For seven days no yeast shall be found in your houses; for anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel, whether a sojourner 
or a native of the land. <LI value='20'> You shall eat nothing made with yeast; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread. <LI value='21'> And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out 
and take for yourselves a member of the flock according to your families, and slaughter the Passover. <LI value='22'> And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and you are to dip it in the blood that is in the basin 
and strike<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. And you shall not go out, no one out of the door of his house until the morning. <LI value='23'> And Jehovah will go through to 
inflict the plague on Egypt; and He will see the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, and Jehovah will pass by the door and not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to inflict the plague. <LI value='24'> 
And you shall keep this custom<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> as a statute for yourself and your children for evermore. <LI value='25'> And it shall be, when you come to the land which Jehovah will give you, as He has spoken, that 
you shall keep this service. <LI value='26'> And it shall be, when your children say to you, What do you mean by this service?<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> <LI value='27'> That you shall say, This is the Passover sacrifice to Jehovah, because He passed 
by the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He inflicted the plague on Egypt, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed, and bowed down. <LI value='28'> And the children of Israel went and did 
as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron - so they did. <LI value='29'> And it happened at midnight, that Jehovah struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from Pharaoh's firstborn who was to sit on his throne 
even to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> and all the firstborn of the beasts. <LI value='30'> And Pharaoh rose that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a 
great cry in Egypt, for there was no house where there was not one dead. <LI value='31'> And he called Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise, go out from the midst of my people, both you and the children of Israel; 
and go, serve Jehovah, in accordance with what you have spoken. <LI value='32'> Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have spoken, and go; and may you also bless me. <LI value='33'> And Egypt pressed the people, 
in a hurry to send them away from the land; for they said, We are all dying. <LI value='34'> And the people carried their dough before the yeast was added, their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their 
shoulder.  <LI value='35'> And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked from the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and clothes. <LI value='36'> And Jehovah gave the people favour<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> 
in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they lent [these things] to them. And they despoiled the Egyptians.  <LI value='37'> And the children of Israel travelled from Rameses to Succoth, around six hundred thousand 
men (vir) on foot, besides young children.  <LI value='38'> And also a large mixed crowd went up with them, and flocks and herds, an extremely large acquisition of them. <LI value='39'> And they baked the dough which 
they brought out of Egypt - unleavened cakes, since no yeast was added, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, and also had not made for themselves provision for the way. <LI value='40'> And the 
dwelling of the children of Israel, when they dwelt in Egypt, [lasted] four hundred and thirty years. <LI value='41'> And so it was at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even on this same day it was, 
that all the hosts of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt. <LI value='42'> This was the night when Jehovah was keeping watch,<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a> to lead them out of the land of Egypt; this is that night when Jehovah was keeping 
watch,<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a> for all the children of Israel [to observe] throughout their generations. <LI value='43'> And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the Passover: No son of a foreigner shall 
eat it.  <LI value='44'> And every man's slave, a purchase paid for with silver,<A name="fntext8"></a><A href="#fn8"><sup>h</sup></a> when you have circumcised him, shall eat it. <LI value='45'> A stranger and a hired servant shall not eat it. <LI value='46'> It shall be eaten in 
one house; you shall not bring any of the flesh outside the house, and you shall not break a bone of it. <LI value='47'> All the assembly of Israel shall keep it. <LI value='48'> And when a sojourner sojourns with you and would 
keep the Passover to Jehovah, every male he has shall be circumcised, and then he shall come near to keep it, and shall be as if a native of the land. And no uncircumcised person shall eat it. <LI value='49'> 
There shall be one law for the native and for the sojourner sojourning in the midst of you. 50 And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron - so they did. 51 And so 
it was on this same day, that Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.

<p>{1} CAPUT XII 	@1 I Exodi$ 	1.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen et ad Aharonem in terra Aegypti, dicendo, 	2. 
 Mensis hic vobis caput mensium, primus hic vobis mensibus anni. 	3.  Loquimini ad omnem coetum Israelis, dicendo, In decimo mensis hujus et accipient sibi quisque pecudem ad domum patrum, pecudem 
ad domum. 	4.  Et si minor est domus prae esse a pecude, et (x)accipiat ille et vicinus illius propinquus ad domum ejus in numero animarum, quisque ad os comedere ejus, numerabitis super pecudem. 	5. 
 Pecus integra, mascula, filius anni erit vobis; ex agnis et ex capris accipietis. 	6.  Et erit vobis ad custodiam usque ad quantum decimum diem mensis hujus; et mactabunt illam omnis congregatio coetus 
Israelis inter vesperas. 	7.  Et accipient de sanguine, et dabunt super binos postes et super superliminare, super domibus in quibus comedent illam. 	8.  Et comedent carnem in nocte illa assam 
igne, et azyma super amaroribus comedent illam. 	9.  Ne comedatis de illa crudum, et coquendo coctum in aquis, verum tamen assum igne, caput ejus super cruribus ejus et super medio ejus. 	10.  Et non 
relinquetis de illo usque ad mane; et residuum de illo usque ad mane igne comburetis. 	11.  Et sic comedetis illam, lumbi vestri cincti, calcei vestri in pedibus vestris, et baculus vester in manu 
vestra; et comedetis illam in festinatione; Paesach hoc JEHOVAE. 	12.  Et transibo per terram Aegypti in nocte illa, et percutiam omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti ab homine et usque ad bestiam; et 
in omnes deos Aegypti faciam judicia, Ego JEHOVAH. 	13.  Et erit sanguis vobis ad signum super domibus ubi vos, et videro sanguinem, et praeteribo praeter vos, et non erit in vobis plaga perditori, 
in percutere Me terram Aegypti. 	14.  Et erit dies ille vobis ad memoriale, et feriabimini illum festum JEHOVAE, generationibus vestris, statuto aeterno feriabimini illum. 	15.  Septem diebus azyma 
comedetis, etiam in die primo cessare facietis fermentum e domibus vestris, quia omnis comedens fermentatum, et exscindetur anima illa ex Israele, a die primo usque ad diem septimum. 	16.  Et in die 
primo convocatio sancta, et in die septimo convocatio sancta erit vobis; nullum opus fiet in illis, tantum quod comedatur omni animae, hoc solum fiet vobis. 	17.  Et observabitis azyma, quia in eodem 
die hoc eduxi exercitus vestros e terra Aegypti, et custodietis diem hunc generationibus vestris statuto aeterno. 	18.  In primo, in quartodecimo die mensis in vespera comedetis azyma, usque ad diem 
primum et vicesimum mensis in vespera. 	19.  Septem diebus fermentum non invenietur in domibus vestris, quia omnis comedens fermentatum, et exscindetur anima illa e coetu Israelis, in peregrino et in 
indigena terrae. 	20.  Nullum fermentatum comedetis, in omnibus habitationibus vestris comedetis azyma. 	21.  Et vocavit Moscheh omnes seniores Israelis, et dixit ad illos, Protrahite et accipite 
vobis pecudem gregis juxta familias vestras, et mactate Paesach. 	22.  Et accipietis fasciculum hyssopi, et intingatis in sanguine qui in pelvi, et attingere faciatis ad superliminare et ad binos postes, 
de sanguine qui in pelvi; et vos non exibitis quisquam ex ostio domus suae usque ad mane. 	23.  Et transibit JEHOVAH ad infligendum plagam Aegypto, et viderit sanguinem super superliminari et super 
binis postibus, et praeteribit JEHOVAH praeter ostium, et non dabit perditori venire ad domus vestras ad infligendum plagam. 	24.  Et custodietis verbum hoc ad statutum tibi et filiis tuis usque 
aeternum. 	25.  Et erit quod veneritis ad terram quam dabit JEHOVAH vobis, quemadmodum locutus est, et custodietis servitium hoc. 	26.  Et erit quod dixerint ad vos filii vestri, Quodnam servitium hoc 
vobis? 	27.  Et dicetis, Sacrificium Paesach hoc JEHOVAE, quod praeteriverit praeter domos filiorum Israelis in Aegypto, in infligere Illum plagam Aegypto, et domos nostras liberaverit; et inflexit 
se populus, et incurvavit se. 	28.  Et iverunt et fecerunt filii Israelis quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi et Aharoni, ita fecerunt. 	29.  Et factum in media nocte, et JEHOVAH percussit omne primogenitum 
in terra Aegypti, a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super throno illius, usque ad primogenitum captivi qui in domo foveae, et omne primogenitum bestiae. 	30.  Et surrexit Pharao nocte illa, 
et omnes servi illius, et omnes Aegyptii, et fuit clamor magnus in Aegypto, quia nulla domus ubi non mortuus. 	31.  Et vocavit Moschen et Aharonem noctu, et dixit, Surgite, exite e medio populi mei, 
etiam vos, etiam filii Israelis, et ite, servite JEHOVAE, secundum loqui vos. 	32.  Etiam greges vestros, etiam armenta vestra accipite, quemadmodum locuti estis, et ite, et benedicatis etiam mihi. 	33. 
 Et invaluit Aegyptus super populum, festinando dimittere illos e terra, quia dixerunt, Omnes nos morimur. 	34.  Et portavit populus massam suam antequam fermentaretur, mactrae illorum ligatae 
in vestibus illorum super humero illorum. 	35.  Et filii Israelis fecerunt secundum verbum Moschis, et petierunt ab Aegyptiis vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes. 	36.  Et JEHOVAH dedit gratiam populi 
in oculis Aegyptiorum, et commodaverunt illis; et eripuerunt Aegyptiis. 	37.  Et profecti filii Israelis de Raamses ad Succoth, quasi sescenta milia peditum virorum, praeter infantem. 	38.  Et etiam 
turba mixta multa ascendit cum illis, et grex et armentum acquisitio gravis valde. 	39.  Et coxerunt massam quam eduxerunt ex Aegypto, placentas azymas, quia non fermentata, quia expulsi ex Aegypto, 
et non potuerunt commorari, et etiam viaticum non fecerunt sibi. 	40.  Et habitatio filiorum Israelis qua habitaverunt in Aegypto, triginta anni et quadringenti anni. 	41.  Et fuit a fine triginta 
annorum et quadringentorum annorum, et fuit in eodem die hoc, exiverunt omnes exercitus JEHOVAE e terra Aegypti. 	42.  Nox custodiarum haec JEHOVAE, ad educendum illos e terra Aegypti; haec nox ista 
JEHOVAE custodiarum omnibus filiis Israelis ad generationes illorum. 	43.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen et Aharonem, Hoc statutum Paesach, omnis filius alienigenae non comedet illud. 	44.  Et omnis 
servus viri, emptio argenti, et circumcideris illum, tunc comedet illud. 	45.  Inquilinus et mercenarius non comedet illud. 	46.  In domo una comedetur, non educes e domo de carne foras; et os non 
frangetis in illo. 	47.  Omnis coetus Israelis facient illud. 	48.  Et cum peregrinatur tecum peregrinus, et faciat Paesach JEHOVAE, circumcidetur illi omnis masculus, et tunc accedet ad faciendum 
illud, et erit sicut indigena terrae; et omnis praeputiatus non comedet illud. 	49.  Lex una erit indigenae et peregrino peregrinanti in medio vestrum. 	50.  Et fecerunt omnes filii Israelis quemadmodum 
praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi et Aharoni, ita fecerunt. 	51.  Et fuit in eodem die hoc, eduxit JEHOVAH filios Israelis e terra Aegypti quoad exercitus illorum. </p>
