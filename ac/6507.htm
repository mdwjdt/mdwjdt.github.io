<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6507节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6507.</strong>“埃及人为他哀哭”表教会记忆知识的哀恸。这从“哀哭”的含义和“埃及人”的代表清楚可知：“哀哭”是悲痛的顶点，是代表内在悲伤的一种行为（参看<a href="3801.htm">3801</a>，<a href="4786.htm">4786</a>节）；“埃及人”是指教会的记忆知识（<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。“埃及人为他哀哭”所表示的教会记忆知识的哀恸，并非表示由于他的死亡而悲伤，因为这是字义。相反，此处他们的悲伤表示，因为“以色列”所代表的教会良善在从教会的外在上升到教会的内在，就是真理之良善时，离开记忆知识，就是教会的外在。事实上，在这种情况下，它不再像以前那样看记忆知识与它自己同在，而是看它们在它自己之下。因为当属灵教会的真理变成良善时，就会发生一种反转，此人不再从真理的角度，而是从良善的角度看真理。这种反转前面已讨论过好几次了。悲伤由此而来，这也是由以下事实产生的：那时，一种不同的秩序被引入到记忆知识里面，这种事不经痛苦是不能实现的。</p>

And the Egyptians wept for him. That this signifies the sadness of the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of "weeping," as being the height of sadness, and a representative 
of internal mourning (see n. 3801, 4786); and from the representation of the Egyptians, as being the memory-knowledges of the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966). The sadness of the memory-knowledges of 
the church, which is signified by the "Egyptians weeping for Israel," does not mean sadness on account of his death, for this is the sense of the letter; but their sadness here means sadness because 
the good of the church, which is represented by Israel, had left the memory-knowledges, which are the externals of the church, when it ascended from them to the internal of the church, which is the good 
of truth; for in this case it no longer regards memory-knowledges as being with itself, as before, but beneath itself. For when the truth of the spiritual church becomes good, a revolution takes place, 
and the man no longer looks at truths from truths, but from good, which revolution has already been several times described. From this comes the sadness, and it also comes from the fact that a different 
order is effected among the memory-knowledges, which is not effected without pain. </p>

'And the Egyptians wept for him' means sadness on the part of the Church's factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'weeping' as the highest degree of sadness, and an action representing 
internal grief, dealt with in <a href="3801.htm">3801</a>, <a href="4786.htm">4786</a>; and from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as the Church's factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. The sadness on the part of the Church's factual 
knowledge which is described by 'the Egyptians wept for Israel' does not mean sadness because of his death; that is the meaning in the literal sense. Rather the sadness meant here is sadness because 
the Church's good, represented by' Israel', had departed from the factual knowledge that forms the external level of the Church when it rose up from there to an internal level, the level of the good 
of truth. For it does not now see that knowledge present with itself, as it did before, but beneath itself. For when the truth of the spiritual Church becomes good, a reversal takes place, in that the 
person no longer sees truths from the point of view of truths but of good. This reversal has been discussed several times before. From this comes the sadness, which also arises from the fact that a 
different order is introduced at that time within the factual knowledge; and that is not accomplished without pain. </p>

`Et fleverunt illum Aegyptii':  quod significet tristitiam scientificorum Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `flere' quod sit summum tristitiae, et repraesentativum luctus interni, de qua n. 3801, 
4786; et ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint scientifica Ecclesiae, de qua n. 4749, 4964, 4966.  Tristitia scientificorum Ecclesiae quae per `fleverunt Israelem Aegyptii', non significat tristitiam 
propter mortem ejus, hic enim sensus est sensus litterae; sed tristitia hic significat tristitiam propter quod bonum Ecclesiae quod per `Israelem' repraesentatur, reliquerit scientifica quae sunt 
externa Ecclesiae, cum ab illis ascenderit ad Ecclesiae internum quod est bonum veri; tunc enim non spectat scientifica apud se, ut prius, sed infra se; nam cum verum Ecclesiae spiritualis fit bonum, 
tunc fit versura, et tunc non amplius spectat vera ex veris sed vera ex bono, de qua versura prius aliquoties actum est; inde tristitia; et quoque inde quod tunc fiat alius ordo inter scientifica, 
quod {1}nec fit absque dolore. @1 non$ </p>
