<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5580节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5580.</strong>“从埃及带来”表从记忆知识所获得的。这从“埃及”的含义清楚可知：“埃及”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>-<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节），“从埃及带来”就表示它们来自这记忆知识。“埃及”在正面意义上表示教会的记忆知识，也就是说在教会的外在形式上服务于教会的东西（参看<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。这类知识就像通向房屋的门廊一样用来将人引入教会的真理。因为对这些知识的印象首先冲击感官，由此打开通往心智更内在部分的道路。事实上，众所周知，感官的外在事物首先在人里面被打开，然后打开的是感官的内在事物，最后打开的是理解力的概念；当理解力的概念被打开时，它们就在前者里面呈现出来，以至于能被理解。原因在于，理解力的概念通过从感官印象提取的过程而由感官印象产生；因为理解力的概念是结论，它们一旦形成，就会与感官印象分离，并上升到更高层面，远在感官印象之上。这一切通过经由天堂从主而来的流注实现。由此可见从记忆知识所获得的真理是什么意思。</p>

Which they had brought from Egypt. That this signifies which were from memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (see n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462), that 
they were "from these," is signified by their "bringing it thence." By "Egypt" in a good sense are signified the memory-knowledges of the church, namely, those which are of service for the form of the 
church (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966). By means of such knowledges man is introduced into the truths of the church as through a court into a house; for these knowledges are what first strike the senses, 
and thereby open a way to interior things; for it is known that the outward things of sense are first opened in man, and then the inner things of sense, and at last the things of the understanding; and 
that when these last have been opened, they are represented in the former so as to be comprehended. The reason is that things of the understanding arise from those of sense by a sort of extraction, 
for things of the understanding are conclusions, which when formed are separated, and rise to a higher plane. This is brought about by the influx of spiritual things through heaven from the Lord. From 
all this it is plain how it is that truths are from memory-knowledges. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5580</b></p><p><b>5580.</b>
'Which they had brought from Egypt' means which had been obtained from factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'Egypt' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, from this 
knowledge being meant by 'they had brought from there'. In the good sense 'Egypt' means the facts which the Church possesses, that is to say, which serve the Church in the outward form it takes, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. Facts of this kind, like the porch leading into a house, serve to introduce a person into the truths which the Church possesses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For the impression of those facts on a person's 
senses takes place first, and this opens the way into the more internal parts of the mind. Indeed it is well known that the area of external sensory perception is opened up first in a person, then that 
of the more internal sensory perceptions, and finally that where intellectual concepts reside; and that once the area where those concepts reside has been opened up, such concepts there are represented, 
to enable them to be understood, within those sensory impressions The reason for this is that intellectual concepts spring up out of sensory impressions by a process of extraction from them; for 
intellectual concepts are deductions which, once they have been made, are separated from and rise far above sensory impressions. The presence of spiritual influences coming from the Lord by way of heaven 
is what accomplishes all this. From these things one may see what is implied by truths obtained from factual knowledge. </p>

`Quam adduxerunt ex Aegypto': quod significet quae ex scientificis, constat ex significatione `Aegypti' quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; quod ex illis, significatur per quod 
`adduxerint inde'; per `Aegyptum' in bono sensu significantur scientifica quae sunt Ecclesiae, nempe quae inserviunt formae Ecclesiae, videatur n. 4749, 4964, 4966; per talia introducitur homo in vera 
Ecclesiae sicut per atrium in domum; [2]sunt enim illa scientifica quae primum incurrunt in sensus, et sic aperiunt viam ad interiora, nam notum est quod sensualia externa primum apud hominem aperiantur 
et dein {1}sensualia interiora, et denique intellectualia, et cum aperta sunt intellectualia, quod haec repraesententur in illis ut capi queant; causa est quia intellectualia ex sensualibus exsurgunt 
per modum {2}extractionis, sunt enim intellectualia conclusiones quae, cum factae, separantur et sublimius vadunt; haec operatur influxus spiritualium, qui per caelum a Domino; ex his patet quomodo
