<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10834节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10834</strong>.关于这个星球的太阳，在我们看来，这太阳就是一颗恒星；他们说，在那里的居民看来，它有人头那么大，并且有火焰的颜色。他们一年有200天，一天相当于我们的9个小时。他们通过在我里面觉察我们地球上的天数时长推算出这一点。他们还说，他们生活在永恒的春夏时节；因此，田野盛开，树木不断结果。这是因为他们一年如此之短，仅相当于我们一年中的75天；一年的时间如此之短的地方，冬天的寒冷和夏天的炎热都不会持续太久，结果土地总是保持在春天的状态。</p>

With respect to the sun of that earth, which to us is a star, they said that it appears to the inhabitants of the size of the human head, of the color of flame; that their year is two hundred days long, 
and that a day is equal to nine hours of our time, which they were able to infer from the length of the days of our earth as perceived in me; and further that they have perpetual spring and summer, 
and consequently that the fields are in bloom, and the trees bear fruit, continuously. The reason of this is that their year is so short, being equal only to the time of seventy-five days of our year; 
and where the years are so short, there the cold does not linger in winter, nor the heat in summer, in consequence of which the ground is constantly in a state of spring. </p>

When asked about the sun of that planet, which to us is a star, they said that as seen by the inhabitants there it is the size of a human head and has the colour of flame. There are <a href="200.htm">200</a> days in a year, 
and a day measured in our units of time lasts <a href="9.htm">9</a> hours. This they were able to deduce by perceiving within myself how long the days are on our planet. They also said that they live in endless spring 
and summer, and therefore the fields are in bloom and the trees are bearing fruit unceasingly. The reason why this should be so is that their year is so short, lasting merely <a href="75.htm">75</a> days if measured in our 
units of time; and where the years are so short, the cold does not last long in winter, nor does the heat in summer, so that the condition of the ground is always as it is in spring.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10834</b>
</p><b>10834.</b>
De sole illius telluris qui nobis est stella, dicebant quod ille appareat incolis magnitudine capitis humani, flammeo colore; quod tempus annuum illis sit 200 dierum, et quod dies aequet 9 horas nostri 
temporis, quod ex diuturnitate dierum nostrae telluris in me percepta concludere potuerunt; et porro, quod illis vernum et aestivum perpetuum sit, et inde quod campi floreant, et arbores fructum ferant 
continue; causa quod ita sit, est quia annus eorum tam brevis est, aequans modo tempus dierum nostri anni, et ubi anni tam breves sunt, ibi non frigus moratur hieme, nec aestus (x)aestate, unde 
vernat humus continue. </p>
