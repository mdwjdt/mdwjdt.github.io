<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>975.</strong>最后论述的是总体上的古教会。“闪”在此用来表内在敬拜，“雅弗”表与内在敬拜相对应的外在敬拜，“含”表脱离仁之信，“迦南”表脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜（19-29节）。该教会想凭自己探究信之真理，且通过推理来探究，由此陷入错误和曲解（19-21节）。由于这类错误和曲解，具有脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜之人嘲弄信之教义本身（22节）；而既具有内在敬拜，又具有源于内在敬拜的外在敬拜之人则很好地解读了这类事物，并为之辩解（23节）。具有脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜之人是最劣等的（24-25节）。尽管如此，他们仍能在教会内履行劣等的服务（26-27节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]975.</strong> The final subject, in general, is the ancient church. Shem means inner worship in that church; Japheth, outer worship corresponding to inner worship; Ham, faith detached from charity; and Canaan, outer worship detached from inner (verses 19-end). Because the ancient church wanted to explore religious truth in a self-directed way, through the use of rational argumentation, it fell into error and perversions for the first time (verses 19, 20, 21). On the basis of such misconceptions, people who engage in outer worship detached from inner worship sneer at what faith truly teaches (verse 22). But people who worship inwardly, and those whose outward worship results from inward worship, put a good interpretation on such things and excuse them (verse 23). Those whose external worship is detached from internal are the lowest of the low (verses 24, 25), and yet they are capable of serving the church in lowly ways (verses 26, 27). </p>

It treats lastly of the Ancient Church in general; by "Shem" is meant internal worship; by "Japheth" corresponding external worship; by "Ham" faith separated from charity; and by "Canaan" external worship 
separated from internal (from verse 19 to the end). This church, through the desire to investigate from itself the truths of faith, and by reasonings, first lapsed into errors and perversions (verses 
19 to 21). Those who are in external worship separated from internal, deride the doctrine of faith itself, in consequence of such errors and perversions (verse 22); but those who are in internal 
worship, and in the external worship thence derived, put a good interpretation on such things, and excuse them (verse 23). Those who are in external worship separated from internal, are most vile (verses 
24, 25); and yet they are able to perform vile services in the church (verses 26, 27). </p>

Finally the subject is the Ancient Church in general. At this point 'Shem' is used to mean internal worship, 'Japheth' external worship corresponding to it, 'Ham' faith separated from charity, and 'Canaan' 
external worship separated from internal, verses 19-end. Wishing to investigate from itself the truths of faith, and to do so by means of reasonings, that Church first sank into errors and perversities, 
verses 19-21. As a result of such errors and perversities people whose worship is external separated from internal mock the doctrine of faith itself, verse 22, While those whose worship is both 
internal and also external deriving from internal place a good interpretation upon such things and make excuses for them, verse 23. People whose worship is external separated from internal are the 
lowest of all, verses 24, 25. But for all that, they are still able to Perform inferior types of service within the Church, verses 26, 27. </p>

Demum agitur de Antiqua Ecclesia in genere, et ibi per 'Shemum' intelligitur cultus internus, per 'Japhetum' cultus externus correspondens, per 'Ham' fides separata a charitate, per 'Canaan' cultus externus 
separatus ab interno, a vers. 19 ad fin: quod Ecclesia illa, ex eo quod investigare vellet vera fidei ex se, et per ratiocinia in errores et perversa primum lapsa sit, vers. 19-21: quod ii qui 
in cultu externo separato ab interno sunt, ex talibus ipsam doctrinam fidei irrideant, vers. 22: at quod illi qui in cultu interno et qui in externo inde, talia interpretentur in bonum et excusent, vers. 
23: qui in cultu separato externo sunt, quod vilissimi, vers. 24, 25: et quod usque vilia servitia praestare queant in Ecclesia, vers. 26, 27. </p>
