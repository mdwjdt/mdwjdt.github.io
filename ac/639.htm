<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>639.</strong>“方舟”表该教会成员，或被称为挪亚的教会。这一点从下面对它的描述足以清楚明了，从以下事实也清楚可知：主的圣言处处象征属灵、属天之物，即圣言是属灵和属天的。若方舟及其涂抹的柏油、尺寸、构造，还有大洪水真如字面上所说的那样，那么有关它的叙述绝不会有任何属灵、属天之物。它只不过是历史事物，和世俗作者所描述的类似事物一样对人类没有任何用处。但由于主的圣言内在处处包含和象征属灵、属天之物，故显而易见，方舟，以及论到方舟的一切皆象征尚未揭开的隐藏之物。<br />②其它地方所指相同，如藏摩西的小蒲草箱，它被搁在河边的芦荻中（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出2.3.htm">2:3</a>）。举个更高尚的例子，如旷野中的圣约柜，它是照着在西奈山上指示给摩西的样式建造的。若非这个圣约柜中的每一样东西都代表主及其国，那它无非就是一种偶像，所进行的敬拜也是偶像崇拜。同样，所罗门的圣殿本身毫无神圣性可言。使它神圣的并非其中的金、银、香柏木、石头，而是这些材料所代表的特定事物。此处也一样，若非方舟、它的构造及其一切细节象征教会的一些奥秘，圣言就不是主的圣言，而是一种死的文字，如同世俗作者所写书中的文字。由此清楚可知，“方舟”表教会成员，或被称为挪亚的教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]639.</strong> The symbolism of the ark as a member of this church — the church called Noah — can be seen fairly clearly from its description in subsequent verses. It can also be seen from the fact that the Lord's Word concerns itself throughout with spiritual and heavenly subjects. To put it another way, his Word is spiritual and heavenly.<br />If the ark (with its specifications of tarring, dimension, and construction) and the Flood had no greater significance than the words themselves suggest, spiritual and heavenly implications would be utterly lacking. The story itself would be everything and would perform no more critical service to humankind than similar literature written by secular authors.<br />But in every corner of its inmost recesses the Lord's Word contains and enfolds spiritual and heavenly matters, and this leads directly to the conclusion that the ark and everything said of it carries a hidden meaning not yet uncovered.<br />[2] The same holds true elsewhere, as, for instance, in respect to the little ark with Moses hidden inside that was laid among the rushes by the river's edge in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_639/bible_king-james-version_exodus_2_3" target=_top>Exodus 2:3</a>. It is even more sublimely true of the sacred ark in the wilderness, built according to the model shown to Moses on Mount Sinai. If it had not represented the Lord and his kingdom in each and every one of its details, it would have functioned as nothing more than a kind of idol or a cult object. Again, take Solomon's temple. It had no innate holiness derived from the gold, silver, cedar, and stone of its construction, but gained all its holiness from the attributes individually represented by those materials. Likewise here; if Noah's ark with the itemized plan for building it did not symbolize some hidden characteristic of the church, the Word would be not the Lord's Word but a string of words devoid of life and no different from the work of any secular writer.<br />The logical conclusion is that the ark symbolizes a person belonging to the church called Noah, or the church itself. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 639</b></p><p><b>639.</b>
That by the "ark" is signified the man of that church, or the church called "Noah" is sufficiently evident from the description of it in the following verses; and from the fact that the Lord's Word everywhere 
involves spiritual and celestial things; that is, that the Word is spiritual and celestial. If the ark with its coating of pitch, its measurement, and its construction, and the flood also, signified 
nothing more than the letter expresses, there would be nothing at all spiritual and celestial in the account of it, but only something historical, which would be of no more use to the human race 
than any similar thing described by secular writers. But because the Word of the Lord everywhere in its bosom or interiors involves and contains spiritual and celestial things, it is very evident 
that by the ark and all the things said about the ark, are signified hidden things not yet revealed.  
 </p>
<p><b>[2] </b>It is the same in other places, as in the case of the little ark in which Moses was concealed, 
which was placed among the sedge by the riverside (Exod. 2:3); and to take a more lofty instance, it was the same with the holy ark in the wilderness, that was made after the pattern shown to Moses 
on Mount Sinai. If each and all things in this ark had not been representative of the Lord and His kingdom, it would have been nothing else than a sort of idol, and the worship idolatrous. In like manner 
the temple of Solomon was not holy at all of itself, or on account of the gold, silver, cedar, and stone in it, but on account of all the things which these represented. And so here-if the ark and 
its construction, with its several particulars, did not signify some hidden thing of the church, the Word would not be the Word of the Lord, but a kind of dead letter, as in the case of any profane writer. 
Therefore it is evident that the ark signifies the man of the church, or the church called "Noah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 639</b></p><p><b>639.</b>
That 'the ark' means the member of this Church, or the Church called Noah, becomes sufficiently clear from the description of it below, and also from the fact that the Word of the Lord in every part 
embodies things that are spiritual and celestial, that is, the Lord's Word is spiritual and celestial. If the ark and the covering of it with bitumen, its measurements, and its construction, and also 
the Flood, meant no more than what the letter declares there would be absolutely nothing spiritual and celestial about it. It would be mere history and of no more use to the human race than similar descriptions 
found in secular authors. Now because the Word of the Lord in every part contains and embodies within its bosom or inner recesses things that are spiritual and celestial it is quite clear that 
'the ark' and everything said about the ark mean arcana which are as yet undisclosed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The same is meant elsewhere by, for example, the little ark in which Moses was hidden and which was placed 
in the reeds by the riverbank, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%202:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 2:3</a>; and the sacred Ark in the wilderness, constructed according to the design indicated to Moses on Mount Sinai, is an even more sublime example. Unless every 
single thing in this sacred Ark had been representative of the Lord and His kingdom, it would have been no more than a kind of idol, and the worship that took place would have been idolatrous. So too 
with Solomon's Temple. Of itself it was in no sense holy. Nor did the gold, silver, cedar, and stone there make it so, but the particular things represented by those materials. And similarly in the present 
context, unless the ark and the construction of it with all its details meant some arcanum of the Church, the Word would not be the Word of the Lord but some dead piece of literature such as that 
found among the works of any secular author. From this it is clear that 'the ark' means the member of the Church, or the Church called Noah. </p>

</p><b>639.</b>
Quod per 'arcam' significetur homo hujus Ecclesiae, seu Ecclesia Noahus dicta, constare satis potest a descriptione ejus in sequentibus; tum ex eo quod Verbum Domini ubivis involvat spiritualia et caelestia, 
hoc est, quod Verbum Domini sit spirituale et caeleste: si arca, cum ejus bituminatione, dimensione, et constructione, ut et diluvium, non plus quam sonat littera, significarent, nihil prorsus 
spirituale et caeleste foret, sed modo aliquid historicum, quod pluri usui non foret humano generi quam simile quid, quod describitur a profanis: at quia Verbum Domini ubivis in sinu seu recessu sua 
continet et involvit spiritualia et caelestia, constat clare quod per 'arcam,' et per omnia quae de arca dicitur, significentur arcana nondum detecta: [2] similiter quoque alibi, ut per 'arculam,' in 
qua Moses reconditus, et quae posita in ulva juxta litus fluminis, Exod. ii 3; et adhuc sublimius per 'arcam sanctam' in deserto, quae exstructa secundum typum ostensum Mosi in monte Sinai; in qua nisi 
omnis et singula fuissent repraesentativa Domini et Ipsius regni, non aliud fuisset quam quoddam idolum, et cultus idololatricus; similiter templum Salomonis, quod nusquam sanctum fuit ex se, seu 
ex auro argento, cedro et lapide ibi, sed ex singulis quae repraesentabantur per illa; similiter hic, nisi arca et ejus constructio cultus singulis significarent aliquod arcanum Ecclesiae, Verbum non 
foret Verbum Domini, sed mortua quaedam littera, sicut apud aliquem profanum scriptorem. Quod 'arca' significet hominem Ecclesiae, seu Ecclesiam quae 'Noahus' dicta, inde constat. </p>
