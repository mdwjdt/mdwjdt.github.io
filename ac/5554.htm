<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5554节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5553.</strong>对应于皮肤层的社群在天堂的入口处。他们能察觉涌向天堂第一道门槛处的灵人是何性质，然后要么把他们赶走，要么把他们领进去。所以他们可称作天堂的入口或门槛。</p>

There are very many societies that constitute the external integuments of the body, with differences from the face to the soles of the feet; for there are differences everywhere. I have spoken much with 
them. In regard to spiritual life they had been such that they suffered themselves to be persuaded by others that a thing is so; and when they heard it confirmed from the literal sense of the Word, 
they wholly believed it, and remained in the opinion, and instituted a life, not evil, in accordance with it. Others who are not of a similar nature cannot easily have interaction with them; for they 
cling tenaciously to the opinions they have received, and do not suffer themselves to be led away from them by reasons. Very many such are from this earth, because our planet is in externals, and also 
reacts against internals, as does the skin. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5554</b></p><p><b>5554.</b>
Very many communities exist which constitute the outer coverings of the body, all differing from one another from the face down to the soles of the feet; for differences exist wherever you choose to 
look. I have had many conversations with these communities. So far as their spiritual life was concerned they were the kind of people who had allowed themselves to be convinced by others that this or 
that was the truth; and once they had heard proofs drawn from the sense of the letter of the Word they fully believed it and stuck firmly to the opinion they had received. They also based the life they 
led, though this was not an evil one, on the same convictions. But other spirits who do not possess a similar frame of mind to theirs find it difficult to have any dealings with them because of their 
rigid adherence to the ideas they have accepted and because of their refusal to be led away from these by reasonable thinking. Very many spirits like that come from this 'planet, for our own globe is 
taken up with things of an external nature and responds to internal ones in the way that the skin usually does. </p>

Sunt perplures societates quae constituunt integumenta externa corporis, cum differentia a facie ad plantas pedis, nam ubivis est differentia; cum illis multum locutus sum; quoad spiritualem vitam fuerunt 
tales ut sibi persuaderi {1} passi fuerint {2} ab aliis quod ita sit, et cum audiverant confirmatum ex sensu litterae Verbi, crediderint prorsus, et permanserint in opinione, et vitam secundum 
illa instituerint non malam; at cum illis non facile commercium ab aliis qui non similis indolis sunt, haberi potest, nam opinionibus captis tenaciter inhaerent, nec se inde duci {3} rationibus patiuntur. 
 Ex hac tellure perplures tales sunt, quia orbis noster in externis est, et quoque reagit contra interna sicut solet cutis. @1 persuadere A I$ @2 fuerunt I$ @3 i a $ </p>
