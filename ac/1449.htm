<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1449.</strong>创世记12:8. 从那里他又迁到伯特利东边的山，支搭帐棚。西边是伯特利，东边是艾。他在那里又为耶和华筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名。<br />“从那里他又迁到伯特利东边的山”表主孩童时的第四个状态，也就是说，“迁到伯特利东边的山”表在爱的属天事物上所取得的进步。“支搭帐棚”表信的神圣事物。“西边是伯特利，东边是艾”表祂的状态依然是朦胧的。“他在那里又为耶和华筑了一座坛”表由这种状态所产生的对其父的外在敬拜。“求告耶和华的名”表由这种状态所产生的对其父的内在敬拜。</p><br />

And he moved from there onto a mountain to the east of Bethel and spread his tent; Bethel was toward the sea and Ai toward the east. And there he built an altar to Jehovah and called on Jehovah's name.<br />He moved from there onto a mountain to the east of Bethel symbolizes the Lord's fourth state as a youth, which would involve development in the heavenly aspects of love; these are what the move onto a mountain to the east of Bethel is. And spread his tent symbolizes the holy attributes of faith. And Bethel was toward the sea and Ai toward the east means that his state would still be confused. And he built an altar to Jehovah symbolizes his outward worship of his Father in that state. And called on Jehovah's name symbolizes his inward worship of his Father in that state. </p>

Verse 8. And he removed from thence into the mountain on the east of Bethel, and spread his tent; having Bethel toward the sea, and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to Jehovah, and called 
on the name of Jehovah. "He removed from thence into the mountain on the east of Bethel," signifies the Lord's fourth state when a child, namely, the progression of the celestial things of love, signified 
by being transferred to a mountain on the east of Bethel; "and spread his tent," signifies the holy things of faith; "having Bethel toward the sea, and Ai on the east," signifies that His state was 
still obscure; "and there he built an altar to Jehovah," signifies the external worship of His Father from that state; "and called on the name of Jehovah," signifies the internal worship of His Father 
from that state. </p>

Verse 8 And he removed from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, Bethel being towards the sea and Ai towards the east.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And there he built an altar to Jehovah and called 
on the name of Jehovah. </p>
<p>'He removed from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel' means the Lord's fourth state when He was a boy, that is to say, 'being removed to the mountain on the east of 
Bethel' means an advance made in the celestial things of love. 'And he pitched his tent' means the holy things of faith. 'Bethel being towards the sea and Ai towards the east,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means that His state was 
still obscure. 'And he built an altar to Jehovah' means external worship of His Father arising out of that state. 'And he called on the name of Jehovah' means internal worship of His Father arising 
out of that state.

Vers. 8.  Et transtulit inde in montem ab oriente Betheli, et tetendit tentorium; Bethel a mari, et Ai ab oriente; et aedificavit ibi altare Jehovae, et invocavit nomen Jehovae. 'Transtulit inde in 
montem ab oriente Betheli' significat quartam statum Domini cum puer, nempe progressionem caelestium amoris, quae sunt 'transferri in montem ab oriente Betheli':  'et tetendit tentorium' significat sancta 
fidei:  (x)'Bethel a mari, et Ai ab oriente' significat quod adhuc status Ipsi obscurus:  'et aedificavit altare Jehovae' significat cultum Patris Sui ex illo statu externum:  'et invocavit nomen 
Jehovae' significat cultum Patris Sui ex illo statu internum. </p>
