Verses 3-6. Speak ye unto all the assemblage of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month they shall take to them everyone a lamb* for the house of his fathers, a lamb for the house; and if the house 
is too little for a lamb, then let him take he and his neighbor near unto his house in the number of the souls; everyone for the mouth of his eating shall ye count for the lamb. A lamb unblemished, 
a male, a son of a year shall be for you; ye shall take it from the lambs and from the she-goats;** and it shall be for you to be kept even unto the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole congregation 
of the assemblage of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings. "Speak ye unto all the assemblage of Israel, saying," signifies influx along with the informing of all those who are of the spiritual 
church; "in the tenth of this month," signifies a state of initiation of the interiors; "they shall take to them everyone a lamb," signifies in respect to innocence; "for the house of his fathers, 
a lamb for the house," signifies according to the special good of each one; "and if the house is too little for a lamb," signifies if the particular good is not sufficient for innocence; "then let 
him take he and his neighbor near unto his house," signifies conjunction with the nearest good of truth; "in the number of the souls, everyone for the mouth of his eating shall ye count for the lamb," 
signifies thus the filling up of the good, conformably to the innocence, from so many truths of good, according to the appropriation of the innocence; "a lamb unblemished," signifies innocence unspotted; 
"a male," signifies which is of the faith of charity; "a son of a year shall be for you," signifies a full state; "ye shall take it from the lambs and from the she-goats," signifies the interior 
and exterior good of innocence; "and it shall be for you to be kept," signifies the time and state of initiation; "even unto the fourteenth day of this month," signifies unto a holy state; "and the 
whole congregation of the assemblage of Israel shall kill it," signifies preparation for the enjoyment by all in general who are of the spiritual church; "between the two evenings," signifies the last 
state and the first. * The word "lamb" here (Latin pecud-, Hebrew seh) must be understood to mean the young of both sheep and goats, as defined in verse 5, and also by Swedenborg himself in n. 8020. 
Thus it is either a lamb or a kid. We have no word in English that will precisely render either the Hebrew term or the Latin one. In verse however, the word "lambs," near the end of the verse, is agnus 
in the Latin, and keves in the Hebrew, and thus is correctly rendered "lambs." [Reviser]. ** Latin capra, Hebrew ez, a "she-goat," the mother being taken for her little one. Both "kids" and "she-goats" 
signify "the innocence of the external or natural man, thus the truth and the good of innocence" (Arcana Coelestia n. 3518, subdivisions 3 and 4). [Reviser.] </p>

Verses 3-6 Speak to all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month they shall take for themselves each one a member of the flock according to the household of his fathers, a member of 
the flock according to the household. And if the household is too small for a member of the flock, let him and his neighbour immediately next to his house take one, by the number of the souls; each of 
them according to the mouth of his eating, you shall make your count for the member of the flock. A perfect member, a male, the son of a year it shall be to you; from the lambs and from the she-goats 
you shall take it. And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; and all [the congregation of] the assembly of Israel shall slaughter it between the evenings.  </p>
<p>'Speak to all the assembly 
of Israel, saying' means influx bearing instructions for all belonging to the spiritual Church. 'On the tenth of this month' means the state of the initiation of the interiors. 'They shall take 
for themselves each one a member of the flock' means in respect of innocence. 'According to the household of his fathers, a member of the flock according to the household' means according to each one's 
specific kind of good. 'And if the household is too small for a member of the flock' means if the individual type of good is insufficient for innocence. 'Then he and his neighbour immediately next 
to his house shall take one' means being joined to the nearest good of truth. 'By the number of the souls, [each of them] according to the mouth of his eating, you shall make your count for the member 
of the flock' means making the good sufficient for the innocence by filling it out with truths of good in the exact quantity needed for assimilating innocence. 'A perfect member' means spotless innocence. 
'A male' means which is characteristic of faith rooted in charity. 'The son of a year it shall be to you' means a complete state. 'From the lambs and from the she-goats you shall take it' means 
the good of innocence, interior and exterior. 'And you shall keep it' means the time and state of the initiation. 'Until the fourteenth of the month' means leading up to a holy state. 'And all the congregation 
of the assembly of Israel shall slaughter it' means preparation for enjoyment by all in general belonging to the spiritual Church. 'Between the evenings' means a last and first state. </p>

Vers. 3-6.  Loquimini ad omnem coetum Israelis, dicendo, In decimo mensis hujus et accipient sibi quisque pecudem ad domum patrum, pecudem ad domum.  Et si minor est domus prae esse a pecude, et accipiat 
ille et vicinus illius propinquus ad domum ejus in numero animarum, quisque ad os comedere ejus, numerabitis super pecudem.  Pecus integra, mascula, filius anni erit vobis; ex agnis et ex capris 
accipietis.  Et erit vobis ad custodiam usque ad quartum decimum diem mensis hujus; et mactabunt illam omnis [congregatio] coetus Israelis inter vesperas.  `Loquimini ad omnem coetum Israelis, dicendo'

boni pro innocentia ex totidem veris boni secundum appropriationem ejus: `pecus integra' significat innocentiam immaculatam: `masculam' significat quae fidei charitatis: `filius anni erit vobis' 
significat statum plenum: `ex agnis et ex capris accipietis' significat bonum innocentiae interius et exterius: `et erit vobis ad custodiam' significat tempus et statum initiationis: `usque ad quartum 
decimum mensis' significat ad statum sanctum: `et mactabunt illam omnis congregatio coetus Israelis' significat praeparationem ad fruitionem ab omnibus in communi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `inter 
vesperas' significat statum ultimum et primum. </p>
