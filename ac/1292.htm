<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1292节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1292.</strong>“在示拿地遇见一片山谷”表敬拜变得越发不洁和亵渎。这从“山谷”和“示拿地”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“山”表爱或仁，因为山是至高者，或也可说，是敬拜的至内在事物，如前所述（<a href="795.htm">795</a>节）。所以，“山谷”则表山下之物，即敬拜的较低级事物，或也可说，表敬拜的外在之物。然而，“示拿地”则表其中含有亵渎之物的外在敬拜，如前所述（<a href="1183.htm">1183</a>节）。因此，在本节经文中，“在示拿地遇见一片山谷”表敬拜变得越发不洁和亵渎。<br />在第一节，经上说教会有一样的口音，一样的话语，意思是说有一样的教义，无论总体还是细节。但本节论述了教会的堕落，因为经上说，“他们从东边迁移”，也就是说，他们开始背离仁爱。因为教会，或教会成员越背离仁爱，其敬拜就越背离神圣之物，或换句话说，越靠近不洁和亵渎之物。“在示拿地遇见一片山谷”表教会或敬拜陷入亵渎，其原因在于，山谷是山间的低洼地区，而山如前面所说，表敬拜中爱或仁的神圣事物。这也可从圣言中“山谷”的含义清楚看出来，在原文，当用于这种意义时，山谷被指定为特定术语，用来表示敬拜中多多少少具有亵渎意味的事物。<br />“山谷”表这类事物，这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />论异象谷的默示：因为主万军之耶和华使异象谷有纷扰、践踏、混乱的日子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.1.htm">22:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“异象谷”表幻觉与推理，敬拜由此沦为虚假，最终遭到亵渎。耶利米书：<br />你怎能说，我没有玷污，没有随从众巴力？你看你平谷中的路。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.23.htm">2:23</a>）<br />“平谷”表不洁的敬拜。同一先知书：<br />他们在欣嫩子谷建筑陀斐特的邱坛。因此，看哪，日子将到，这地方不再称为陀斐特和欣嫩子谷，反倒称为杀戮谷。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.31.htm">7:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.32.htm">32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶19.6.htm">19:6</a>）<br />“欣嫩子谷”表地狱，还表对真理和良善的亵渎。<br />以西结书：<br />主耶和华对大山、小冈、水沟、山谷如此说：看哪，我必使刀剑临到这些地方。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.3.htm">6:3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />当那日，我必将以色列地的谷，就是海东人所经过的谷，赐给歌革为坟地。他们就称那地为歌革群众的谷。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.11.htm">39:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.15.htm">15</a>）<br />这论及外在方面的敬拜，“谷”表这类敬拜。不过，当敬拜尚未变得如此亵渎时，希伯来人就将它描述为本节（11:2）所用的山谷，如以赛亚书：<br />我要在山坡上开江河，在谷中造泉源；我要使旷野变为水池，使干地变为涌泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.18.htm">41:18</a>）<br />这论及无知之人，即那些缺乏信与仁的认知，然而却拥有仁爱之人。“谷”在此就表示这些人，以西结书37:1中的“谷”同样表这些人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1292.</strong> The meaning of they found a valley in the land of Shinar as the fact that their worship grew more unclean and profane can be seen from the symbolism of a valley and the symbolism of the land of Shinar.<br />As for a valley: In the Word, mountains symbolize love, or charity, because these are the aspects of worship that reach the highest above or (to say the same thing another way) the deepest within. This was shown earlier, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>. A valley consequently symbolizes what lies at the foot of the mountains — that is, something in worship that is on a lower level or (to put it another way) more on the surface.<br />The land of Shinar, though, symbolizes outward worship that has a profane quality, as shown above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183" target=_top>1183</a>. So "they found a valley in the land of Shinar" here means that their worship grew more unclean and profane.<br />[2] The first verse spoke of the church, saying that it had one language and the same words, or a single broad and a single detailed view of doctrine. The present verse, however, describes how the church went downhill by "setting out from the east," that is, by starting to draw back from neighborly love. The further the church or its members depart from charity, the further its worship departs from holiness and the closer that worship approaches to being unclean and profane.<br />The reason their discovery of a valley in the land of Shinar symbolizes the lapse of the church and of its worship into profanation is that a valley is a low spot between mountains, which, again, symbolize the holy qualities of love or of charity that are present in worship. This can be seen from the meaning of a valley in the Word, which expresses the concept through several different words in the original language.{*1} Those words, when used in this sense, symbolize varying degrees of profanation in worship.<br />[3] Isaiah provides evidence that valleys have such a symbolism:<br />The burden of the Valley of Vision: ... for it is a day of upheaval and trampling and chaos to the Lord Jehovih Sabaoth in the Valley of Vision. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_22_1" target=_top>Isaiah 22:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_22_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />The Valley of Vision stands for delusions and twisted reasoning that introduce falsity and at last profanation into worship. In Jeremiah:<br />How can you say, "I am not defiled; I have not walked after the baals"? Look at your path in the valley! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_23" target=_top>Jeremiah 2:23</a>)<br />The valley stands for unclean worship. In the same author:<br />They built the high places of Topheth that are in the Valley of the Children of Hinnom.{*2} So watch! The days are coming, and it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of the Children of Hinnom but the Valley of Murder. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_7_31-32" target=_top>Jeremiah 7:31-32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_19_6" target=_top>19:6</a>)<br />The Valley of Hinnom stands for hell, and also for the profanation of what is true and good.<br />[4] In Ezekiel:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said to the mountains and hills, the gullies and valleys: "Watch! I myself am bringing a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_6_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 6:3</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />I will give Gog a place there for a grave in Israel: the valley of those going by toward the east of the sea. And they will call it the Valley of Gog's Horde. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_39_11" target=_top>Ezekiel 39:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_39_15" target=_top>15</a>)<br />This is about superficial worship; the valley stands for such worship.<br />When worship has not yet become quite so profane, though, it is portrayed by use of the same word for valley as in the current verse.{*3} An example in Isaiah:<br />I will open rivers on the slopes, and in the middle of valleys I will set springs; [I will make] the desert into a pool of water, and dry land into outlets of water. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_41_18" target=_top>Isaiah 41:18</a>)<br />People who live in ignorance (without access to knowledge about faith and charity) but still in charity are the focus here, and the valley in this verse stands for them. The valley in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_37_1" target=_top>Ezekiel 37:1</a> has a similar meaning.{*4} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Hebrew word used for "valley" in most of the quotations that follow is גַּיְא (gay). In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_2" target=_top>Genesis 11:2</a> itself, and in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_41_18" target=_top>Isaiah 41:18</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_37_1" target=_top>Ezekiel 37:1</a> (both mentioned in the final paragraph), the word is בִִּקְעָה (biq‘ā). The word for "gully" in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_6_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 6:3</a> is אָפִיק ('āṕîq). [LHC]<br />{*2} Topheth was a site of human sacrifice in the Valley of the Children of Hinnom, also called Gehenna, south of Jerusalem. The name Gehenna became a byword for hell because it was associated with the sacrifice of children by fire. Compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374" target=_top>374</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_825" target=_top>825-831</a>.

[LHC, RS]<br />{*3} The Hebrew word for "valley" to which Swedenborg refers here is בִִּקְעָה (biq‘ā). Compare note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_292" target=_top>292</a>, where this word is the second term discussed.

That they found a valley in the land of Shinar. That this signifies that their worship became more unclean and profane, is evident from the signification of "a valley," and of "the land of Shinar." In 
the Word, "mountains" signify love or charity, because these are the highest, or, what is the same, the inmost things in worship, as before shown (n. 795). Hence "a valley" signifies what is beneath 
the mountains, that is, what is lower in worship, which is the same as what is exterior therein; and "the land of Shinar," signifies external worship wherein is what is profane, as before shown (n. 1183). 
And so in this passage, their having found a valley in the land of Shinar signifies that their worship became more unclean and profane.  [2] In the first verse it is said of the church that it 
was of one lip and that its words were one, which means that it had one doctrine in general and in particular. But in this verse the decline of the church is treated of, in that it is said that they journeyed 
from the east, that is, they began to go back from charity; for insofar as the church, or a man of the church, goes back from charity, so far his worship goes back from what is holy, or in other 
words, so far his worship approaches what is unclean and profane. That their having found a valley in the land of Shinar signifies the decline of the church, or of worship, to what is profane, is 
because a valley is a low place between mountains, by which are signified the holy things of love or of charity in worship, as before said. This may also be seen from the signification of "a valley" in 
the Word, where valleys are designated, in the original language, by certain terms which signify, when used in that sense, what is more or less profane in worship.  [3] That "valleys" have such a signification 
is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The burden of the valley of vision. For it is a day of tumult, and of treading down, and of perplexity, to the Lord Jehovih of Armies, in the valley of vision 
(Isa. 22:1, 5). "The valley of vision" denotes phantasies and reasonings, whereby worship is falsified and at last profaned. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     How sayest thou I am not defiled, I have not walked after 
the Baalim? see thy way in the valley (Jer. 2:23). "The valley" denotes unclean worship. Again: </p>
<p>     They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom; wherefore 
behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter (Jer. 7:31-32; 19:6). "The valley of Hinnom" denotes 
hell, and also the profanation of truth and good.  [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said the Lord Jehovih to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Behold Me, I bring 
a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places (Ezek. 6:3). Again: </p>
<p>     I will give unto Gog a place there for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through toward the east of the sea, 
and they shall call it the valley of the multitude of Gog (Ezek. 39:11, 15). This is said of worship in externals; "a valley" denotes such worship. But when the worship has not yet become so profane, 
this is expressed by the Hebrew word for valley that is used in the verse before us (Gen. 11:2); and also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will open rivers upon the slopes, and I will make fountains in the midst 
of the valleys, the wilderness a pool of waters, and the dry land springs of waters (Isa. 41:18). This is said of those who are in ignorance, or who are beyond the knowledges of faith and of charity, 
and yet are in charity. "Valley" as used here denotes these. In like manner does "valley" in Ezekiel 37:1.* * The Hebrew word for "valley" in Ezek. 6 and 39 means merely a "low, flat place," even 
if in a gorge; whereas in Gen. 11, Isa. 41, and Ezek. 37 the Hebrew word used for "valley" means a valley as opposed to mountains, even if it be a plain. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1292</b></p><p><b>1292.</b>
That 'they found a valley in the land of Shinar' means that worship became more unclean and unholy is clear from the meaning of 'a valley' and from the meaning of 'the land of Shinar'. As regards the 
meaning of 'a valley', in the Word 'mountains' means love or charity because these are the highest points, or what amounts to the same, inmost features of worship, as shown already in <a href="795.htm">795</a>. Consequently 
'a valley' means that which is below the mountains, that is, the lower, or what amounts to the same, exterior aspect of worship. 'The land of Shinar' however means external worship which has unholiness 
within it, as shown already in <a href="1183.htm">1183</a>. Thus in this verse the statement that 'they fount` a valley in the land of Shinar' means that worship became more unclean and unholy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Verse one dealt with 
the Church having one lip and its words being one that is, one doctrine in general and in particular. This verse however deals with the decline of the Church -'they travelled from the east' that is, 
they began to depart from charity. For to the extent that the Church, or a member of the Church, departs from charity, its worship departs from what is holy, or its worship approaches what is unclean 
and unholy. The reason 'they found a valley in the land of Shinar' means the decline of the Church, that is, of worship, into unholiness is that a valley is a low-lying area between mountains, which, 
as has been stated, mean the holy things of love or of charity within worship. This also becomes clear from the meaning of 'a valley' in the Word where in the original language several expressions 
for valley occur which mean, when used in that sense, things present in worship that are less or more unholy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'valleys' means such things is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The burden of the valley of 
vision; for the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth has a day of tumult and of trampling and of confusion in the valley of vision. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2022:1,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 22:1, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The valley of vision' stands for delusions and for reasonings by 
which worship is rendered false and at length profaned. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How do you say, I have not been defiled, I have not walked after the baals? Look at your way in the valley. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The valley' 
stands for unclean worship. In the same prophet, They have built the high places of Topheth, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom. Therefore, behold, the days are coming when it will no 
more be called Topheth or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%207:31,%2034,%2019:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 7:31, 34, 19:6</a>. </p>
<p>'The valley of Hinnom' stands for hell, also for the profanation of truth and good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys Behold, I, even I, am bringing a sword places. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%206:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 6:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will give to 
Gog a place there for burial in Israel, the valley of those that pass over towards the east of the sea. And they will call it the valley of the multitude of Gog. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2039:11,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 39:11, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to worship 
in external things, 'the valley' standing for such worship. But when worship has not yet become unholy to that extent, it is described by the word for a valley used here in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2011:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 11:2</a>, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>I 
will open rivers on the sloping heights, and I will place springs in the midst of valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into streams of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:18</a>. </p>
<p>This 
refers to people who are in ignorance, that is, without cognitions of faith and charity, and who yet have charity. 'valley' here stands for those people, as does 'valley' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:1</a>. </p>

Quod 'invenerunt vallem in terra Shinar' significet quod cultus magis immundus et profanus fieret, constat a significatione 'vallis' et a significatione 'terrae Shinar': quod vallem attinet, in Verbo 
'montes' significant amorem seu charitatem, quia altissima, seu quod idem est, intima in cultu, ut ostensum prius n. 795; 'vallis' inde significat quod infra montes, seu quod inferius, aut quod idem,

et profanus fieret.  [2] In primo versu actum est de Ecclesia', quod 'ei unum labium et una verba' seu una doctrina in communi et in particulari; in hoc versu autem agitur de declinatione Ecclesiae, 
nempe quod 'proficiscerentur ab oriente,' hoc est, quod recedere coeperint a charitate nam quantum Ecclesia seu homo Ecclesiae recedit a charitate, tantum ejus cultus a sancto, aut tantum ejus cultus 
accedit ad immundum e profanum: 'quod invenerint vallem in terra Shinar' significat declinationem Ecclesiae seu cultus ad profanum, est inde quia vallis est humile quoddam inter montes, per quos significantur 
sancta amoris seu sancta charitatis in cultu, ut dictum; ut quoque constare potest significatione 'vallis' in Verbo, ubi aliquibus nominibus in lingua originali exprimitur, quibus significantur, 
cum in illo sensu, minus et magis profana in cultu; [3] quod 'valles' talia significent, constat apud Esaiam, 	Onus vallis visionis:... nam dies tumultus, et conculcationis et perplexitatis Domino 
Jehovih Zebaoth, in 	valle visionis xxii 1, 5; </p>
<p>'vallis visionis' pro phantasiis et ratiociniis per quae cultus falsificatur et tandem profanatur: apud Jeremiam, 	Quomodo dicis, Non polluta sum, 
post baales non ambulavi vide viam tuam in valle, ii 23; </p>
<p>'vallis' pro cultu immundo: apud eundem, 	Aedificarunt excelsa Topheth, quae in valle filii Hinnom;... quare ecce dies venientes, et non dicetur 
amplius Topheth aut vallis filii Hinnom, sed vallis occisionis, vii 	31, 32; xix 6; </p>
<p>[4]	'vallis Hinnom' pro inferno, tum pro profanatione veri et boni: apud Ezechielem, 	Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih 
montibus et collibus, alveis e vallibus, Ecce Me, Ego adducens supra vos gladium, et perdam excelsa vestra, vi 3; </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Dabo Gogo locum ibi sepulcri in Israele, vallem transeuntium versus 
orientem maris,... et vocabunt vallem multitudinis Gogi, xxxix 11, 15; </p>
<p>ubi de cultu in externis, 'vallis' pro tali cultu. Sed cum cultus adhuc non ita profanus factus, exprimitur is per nomen vallis 
quo in hoc versu, ut apud Esaiam, 	Aperiam super clivis fluvios, et in medio vallium fonte ponam, desertum in stagnum aquarum, et terram siccam in exitus aquarum, xli 18; </p>
<p>ubi de illis qui in ignorantia 
seu extra cognitiones fidei et charitatis sed usque in charitate sunt, 'vallis' hic pro illis; similiter vallis apud Ezech. xxxvii 1. </p>
