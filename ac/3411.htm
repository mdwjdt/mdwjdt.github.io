<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3411.</strong>创世记26:15-17. 在他父亲亚伯拉罕的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的井，非利士人全都塞住，用土把它们填满了。亚比米勒对以撒说，你离开我们去吧，因为你比我们强盛得多。以撒就离开那里，在基拉耳谷扎营，住在那里。 <br />“在他父亲亚伯拉罕的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的井，非利士人全都塞住”表拥有认知的记忆知识之人不愿知道出自神性的内层真理，因而抹掉了它们。“用土把它们填满了”表用世俗事物。“亚比米勒对以撒说”表主对该教义的直觉。“你离开我们去吧，因为你比我们强盛得多”表他们由于这些真理所含有的神性而无法忍受它们。“以撒就离开那里”表主舍弃教义的内层事物。“在基拉耳谷扎营，住在那里”表主回到低级的理性事物，也就是舍弃内层表象，转向外层表象。</p>

Verses 15-17. And all the wells that his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them up, and filled them with dust. And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go away 
from us; for thou art much mightier than we. And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. "And all the wells that his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham 
his father, the Philistines stopped them up," signifies that they who were in the memory-knowledge of knowledges were not willing to know interior truths which are from the Divine, and thus obliterated 
them; "and filled them with dust," signifies by earthly things; "and Abimelech said unto Isaac," signifies the Lord's perception concerning this doctrine; "go away from us; for thou art much mightier 
than we," signifies that they could not endure those truths because of the Divine in them; "and Isaac departed thence," signifies that the Lord left interior doctrinal things; "and encamped in the 
valley of Gerar, and dwelt there," signifies that He betook Himself to lower rational things, that is, from interior appearances to exterior ones. </p>

Verses 15-17 And all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them up and filled them up with dust. And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away 
from being with us, for you are much mightier than we are. And Isaac went away from there, and camped in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there. </p>
<p>'All the wells which his father's servants had dug in 
the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them up' means that people who possessed knowledge of cognitions did not wish to know interior truths that came from the Divine and so effaced 
them. 'And filled them up with dust' means by means of earthly things. 'And Abimelech said to Isaac' means the Lord's perception regarding that doctrine. 'Go away from being with us, for you are much 
mightier than we are' means that they would not be able to tolerate those things because of their Divine content. 'And Isaac went away from there' means that the Lord abandoned interior matters of doctrine. 
'And camped in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there' means that He did so for lower rational concepts, that is, He abandoned interior appearances for exterior ones. </p>

</p><b>3411.</b>
Vers. 15-17.  Et omnes puteos, quos foderunt servi patris ejus, in diebus Abrahami patris ejus, obturabant illos Philistaei, et impleverunt illos pulvere. Et dixit Abimelech ad Jishakum, Vade a cum 
nobis, quia praevales prae nobis valde. Et ivit abinde Jishak, et castrametatus est in valle Geraris, et habitabat ibi. `Omnes puteos, quos foderunt servi patris ejus, in diebus Abrahami patris ejus, 
obturabant illos Philistaei' significat quod illi qui in scientia cognitionum vera interiora quae a Divino, scire non vellent, sic obliterarent: `et impleverunt illos pulvere' significat per terrestria: 
`et dixit Abimelech ad Jishakum' significat perceptionem Domini de doctrina illa: `Vade a cum nobis, quia praevales prae nobis valde' significat quod illa sufferre non possent propter Divinum in illis: 
`et ivit abinde Jishak' significat quod Dominus doctrinalia interiora relinqueret: `et castrametatus est in valle Geraris, et habitabat ibi' significat quod ad rationalia inferiora, seu ab interioribus 
apparentiis ad exteriores. </p>
