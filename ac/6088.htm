Verses 7-10. And Joseph brought Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life? And Jacob said unto 
Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the 
life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. "And Joseph brought Jacob his father," signifies the presence of general truth from the
