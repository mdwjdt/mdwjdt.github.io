<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第921节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>921.</strong>“挪亚筑了一座祭坛给耶和华”表主的一个代表。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知。古教会的所有宗教仪式都是主的代表，如犹太教会那样。但后世的主要代表是祭坛和燔祭。献燔祭要用洁净的畜类和洁净的鸟类，它们照各自的意义而具有代表性，洁净的畜类表仁之善，洁净的鸟类表信之真。当古教会成员献上这些东西时，就表示他们正在向主献上这些善与真的礼物。只有将这些东西献给主才会讨祂喜悦。而他们的后代，如外邦人，还有犹太人，却败坏了这些祭物，甚至不知道它们具有这样的意义。他们的敬拜仅仅局限于外在事物。<br />这个祭坛是主的主要代表。这一点可从以下事实清楚看出来，即在设立其它仪式、制作约柜、建造圣殿之前，连外邦人当中也有祭坛。这可从亚伯兰明显看出来，如他来到伯特利东边的山上，在那里筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.8.htm">12:8</a>）；后来他被吩咐把以撒作为燔祭献在坛上（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创22.2.htm">22:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创22.9.htm">9</a>），雅各（Jacob）在路斯或伯特利筑了一座坛（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.6.htm">35:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.7.htm">7</a>）；摩西在西奈山下筑了一座坛，并献燔祭（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.4.htm">24:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.6.htm">6</a>）。所有这一切都发生在设立犹太人的祭祀和制作约柜之前，后来在旷野有约柜的地方举行敬拜。外邦人中也有祭坛的事实同样从巴兰明显看出来，巴兰对巴勒说，他当筑七座坛，预备七只牛和七只羊（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.30.htm">30</a>）；还可从摧毁列国祭坛的命令明显看出来（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.5.htm">7:5</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士2.2.htm">2:2</a>）。所以，用祭坛和燔祭进行神圣敬拜并非犹太人所创的新鲜事。事实上，就在人们想宰杀小公牛和其它动物作祭品以示纪念之前，他们就在筑坛了。<br />“祭坛”表主的一个代表，因此“献燔祭”表敬拜祂。这一点明显可见于先知书，如在摩西五经中，当论及拥有祭司职位的利未时：<br />他们要将你的典章教训雅各，将你的律法教训以色列。他们要把香焚在你鼻孔前，把全牲的燔祭献在你的坛上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.10.htm">33:10</a>）<br />这段经文表敬拜的全部。“将你的典章教训雅各（Jacob），将你的律法教训以色列”表内在敬拜，而“要把香焚在你鼻孔前，把全牲的燔祭献在你的坛上”则表相应的外在敬拜，因而表敬拜的全部。以赛亚书：<br />当那日，人必仰望造他们的主，眼目重看以色列的圣者。他必不仰望祭坛，就是自己手所筑的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处“仰望祭坛”明显表示要被废除的一般代表性敬拜。<br />当那日，在埃及陆地中间必有为耶和华筑的一座坛，在埃及的边界上必有为耶和华立的一根柱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.19.htm">19:19</a>）<br />此处“祭坛”同样表外在敬拜。<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />主丢弃自己的祭坛，憎恶自己的圣所。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.7.htm">1:7</a>）<br />“祭坛”表变成偶像崇拜的代表性敬拜。何西阿书：<br />以法莲为赎罪增添祭坛，因此，它们成了使他犯罪的祭坛。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.11.htm">8:11</a>）<br />此处“祭坛”表脱离内在敬拜的所有代表性敬拜，因而表偶像崇拜之物。<br />亚文的高丘，就是以色列取罪的地方，必被毁灭。荆棘和蒺藜必长在他们的祭坛上。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.8.htm">10:8</a>）<br />此处“祭坛”也表偶像崇拜。阿摩司书：<br />我讨罚以色列罪孽的日子，也要讨罚伯特利的祭坛，祭坛的角必被砍下。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />此处“祭坛”同样表已变成偶像崇拜的代表性敬拜。<br />诗篇：<br />求你带我到你的圣山，到你的居所！我就走到神的祭坛，到我最喜乐的神那里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.3.htm">43:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“祭坛”明显表示主。在古时和犹太教会，制作一个祭坛表示主的一个代表。由于对主的敬拜主要通过燔祭和祭物来进行，因而这些事物表示主要的代表性敬拜，故显而易见，祭坛本身表示这种代表性敬拜本身。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]921.</strong> The symbolism of Noah built an altar to Jehovah as the practice of representing the Lord can be seen from the things just now said.<br />All the ritual of the ancient church represented the Lord, as did the ritual of the Jewish religion. But the chief item representing him came to be the altar, along with the burnt offering. Because it was clean animals and birds that were offered, the representation matched the symbolism involved, clean animals meaning the good effects of charity, and clean birds, the true ideas of faith. When the people of the ancient church offered up such creatures, it meant symbolically that the gifts they offered the Lord consisted of these attributes. Nothing else can be offered to the Lord that is pleasing to him.<br />Their descendants, however, like the surrounding nations and the Jews too, corrupted the practice, not realizing that it had any symbolic meaning and viewing all worship as an external affair.<br />[2] The fact that the altar was the main object to represent the Lord can also be seen from this: Before the establishment of any other kind of ritual, before construction of the ark, before the building of the Temple, there were altars, even among non-Jewish nations.<br />We see that when Abram came to the mountain on the east of Bethel, he constructed an altar and called on Jehovah's name (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_8" target=_top>Genesis 12:8</a>). He was ordered to offer Isaac up as a burnt offering on an altar (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_genesis_22_2" target=_top>Genesis 22:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_genesis_22_9" target=_top>9</a>). Jacob built an altar at Luz, which is Bethel (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_genesis_35_6-7" target=_top>Genesis 35:6-7</a>). And Moses built an altar at the foot of Mount Sinai and offered a sacrifice (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_4-5" target=_top>Exodus 24:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_6" target=_top>6</a>). This was before the establishment of the sacrifices and before the construction of the ark, around which they later conducted their worship in the wilderness.<br />By the same token, we know about the existence of altars among non-Jewish nations from the story of Balaam, who told Balak to build seven altars and prepare seven heads of cattle and seven rams (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_1-7" target=_top>Numbers 23:1-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_15-18" target=_top>15-18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_29-30" target=_top>29-30</a>). And it was decreed that those nations' altars should be destroyed (for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_7_5" target=_top>Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_judges_2_2" target=_top>Judges 2:2</a>). So the use of altars and sacrifices in the worship of God was not an innovation on the part of the Jews.<br />In fact before people knew anything about slaughtering cattle and the smaller livestock on altars, they were building them as memorials.<br />[3] The symbolism of altars as the practice of representing the Lord, and of burnt offerings as the resulting worship of him, is clearly evident in the prophets. One example is Moses' prophecy concerning the tribe of Levi, to whom the priesthood was assigned:<br />They will teach your judgments to Jacob and your law to Israel. They will put incense in your nostrils and a whole [burnt offering]{*1} on your altar. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_33_10" target=_top>Deuteronomy 33:10</a>)<br />This is about the totality of worship. "They will teach your judgments to Jacob and your law to Israel" stands for inner worship. "They will put incense in your nostrils and a ‘whole [burnt offering]' on your altar" stands for outward worship that corresponds to inward worship. So the verse stands for the totality of worship. In Isaiah:<br />On that day, humanity will look to its maker, and its eyes will regard the Holy One of Israel; and it will not look to the altars, the work of its hands. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_17_7-8" target=_top>Isaiah 17:7-8</a>)<br />Looking to altars plainly stands for representative worship in general, which was to be abolished. In the same author:<br />On that day there will be an altar to Jehovah in the middle of the land of Egypt and a pillar to Jehovah by its border. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_19_19" target=_top>Isaiah 19:19</a>)<br />Here too the altar stands for external worship.<br />[4] In Jeremiah:<br />The Lord has deserted his altar, has despised his sanctuary. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_2_7" target=_top>Lamentations 2:7</a>)<br />The altar stands for representative worship, which became idolatrous. In Hosea:<br />Ephraim multiplied altars for sinning; it had altars for sinning. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_hosea_8_11" target=_top>Hosea 8:11</a>)<br />The altars stand for every act of representative worship cut off from its inner meaning and so for idolatrous practices. In the same author:<br />The lofty places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. Thorn and thistle will climb over their altars. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_hosea_10_8" target=_top>Hosea 10:8</a>)<br />Again the altars stand for idolatrous worship. In Amos:<br />On the day that I exact punishment on Israel for its transgressions, I will also bring punishment on the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar{*2} will be chopped off. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_amos_3_14" target=_top>Amos 3:14</a>)<br />Once more the altars stand for representative practices that became idolatrous.<br />[5] In David:<br />They will bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling places, and I will go in to God's altar, to God, my happiness and joy. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_psalms_43_3-4" target=_top>Psalms 43:3-4</a>)<br />The altar obviously stands for the Lord. So the construction of an altar in the ancient and Jewish churches stood for the practice of representing the Lord.<br />Since the principal means for carrying out worship of the Lord were burnt offerings and sacrifices and these were consequently the principal symbols for representative worship, it stands to reason that the altar symbolized representative worship itself.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This bracketed interpolation is Swedenborg's, although the same bracketed insertion a few lines later is not. [LHC]<br />{*2} The horns of the altar were projections from the four corners. Their origin is obscure, as is their sacramental function, though in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_1_50" target=_top>1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_2_28" target=_top>2:28</a> fugitives seize on the horns when seeking refuge, and in ceremonies described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_exodus_29_12" target=_top>Exodus 29:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_30" target=_top>Leviticus 4:30</a>, and other passages the horns are either anointed or smeared with sacrificial blood. Perhaps originally they served as posts to secure the sacrificial victims, a use mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_psalms_118_27" target=_top>Psalms 118:27</a>, though biblical scholarship tends to frown on this explanation. The passage cited here (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_921/bible_king-james-version_amos_3_14" target=_top>Amos 3:14</a>) makes clear that the horns were considered an integral part of the altar that could not be removed without desecrating the whole.

And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah. That this signifies a representative of the Lord, is evident from what has just been said. All the rites of the Ancient Church were representative of the Lord, 
as also the rites of the Jewish Church. But the principal representative in later times was the altar, and also the burnt-offering, which being made of clean beasts and clean birds, had its representation 
according to their signification, clean beasts signifying the goods of charity, and clean birds the truths of faith. When men of the Ancient Church offered these, they signified that they offered 
gifts of these goods and truths to the Lord. Nothing else can be offered to the Lord that will be grateful to Him. But their posterity, as the Gentiles and also the Jews, perverted these things, not 
even knowing that they had such a signification, and making their worship consist in the externals only.  [2] That the altar was the principal representative of the Lord, is evident from the fact that 
there were altars, even among Gentiles, before other rites were instituted, and before the ark was constructed, and before the temple was built. This is evident from Abram, as that when he came upon 
the mountain on the east of Bethel he raised an altar and called upon the name of Jehovah (Gen. 12:8); and afterwards he was commanded to offer Isaac for a burnt-offering on an altar (Gen. 22:2, 9). 
So Jacob built an altar at Luz, or Bethel (Gen. 35:6-7); and Moses built an altar under Mount Sinai, and sacrificed (Exod. 24:4-6). All this was before the [Jewish] sacrifices were instituted, and before 
the ark was constructed at which worship was afterwards performed in the wilderness. That there were altars likewise among the Gentiles, is evident from Balaam, who said to Balak that he should build 
seven altars and prepare seven bullocks and seven rams (Num. 23:1-7, 14-18, 29-30); and also from its being commanded that the altars of the nations should be destroyed (Deut. 7:5; Judg. 2:2). Thus 
Divine worship by altars and sacrifices was not a new thing instituted with the Jews. Indeed altars were built before men had any idea of slaying oxen and sheep upon them, but as memorials.  [3] That 
altars signify a representative of the Lord, and burnt-offerings the worship of Him thereby, is plainly evident in the Prophets, as also in Moses when it is said of Levi, to whom the priesthood belonged: </p>
<p> 
    They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law; they shall put incense in Thy nostrils, and whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar (Deut. 33:10),  meaning all worship; for "to 
teach Jacob judgments, and Israel the law" denotes internal worship; and "to put incense in Thy nostrils, and whole burnt-offering on Thine altar" denotes corresponding external worship. In Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    In that day shall a man look unto his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel and he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hand (Isa. 17:7-8), where "looking to the 
altars" plainly signifies representative worship in general, which was to be abolished. Again: </p>
<p>     In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at 
the border thereof to Jehovah (Isa. 19:19), where also "an altar" stands for external worship.  [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord hath cast off His altar, He hath abhorred His sanctuary (Lam. 2:7); </p>
<p>"altar" 
denoting representative worship which had become idolatrous. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been unto him to sin (Hos. 8:11); </p>
<p>"altars" denote here 
all representative worship separate from internal, thus what is idolatrous. Again: </p>
<p>     The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed; the thorn and the thistle shall come up on 
their altars (Hos. 10:8), where "altars" denote idolatrous worship. In Amos: </p>
<p>     In the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel, and the 
horns of the altar shall be cut off (Amos 3:14), where again "altars" denote representative worship become idolatrous.  [5] In David: </p>
<p>     Let them bring me unto the mountain of Thy holiness, and 
to Thy tabernacles. And I will go unto the altar of God, unto God the gladness of my joy (Ps. 43:3-4), where "altar" manifestly denotes the Lord. Thus the building of an altar in the Ancient and in 
the Jewish Church was for a representative of the Lord. As the worship of the Lord was performed principally by burnt-offerings and sacrifices, and thus these things signified principally representative 
worship, it is evident that the altar itself signifies this representative worship itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 921</b></p><p><b>921.</b>
'Noah built an altar to Jehovah' means a representative of the Lord. This is clear from what has been stated just above. All the religious observances of the Ancient Church were representative of the 
Lord, as also were those of the Jewish Church. But the chief representative in later times was the altar, and also the burnt offering, which, because it was made from clean beasts and clean birds, represented 
the same as that of which it was the meaningful sign. Clean beasts represented goods that stem from charity, and clean birds the truths of faith. And when offering these, members of the Ancient 
Church meant that they were offering gifts of those goods or truths to the Lord. Nothing else can be offered up to the Lord that will please Him. But their descendants, like the gentiles, and also 
the Jews, corrupted these offerings, for they did not even know that these had such a meaning. They confined worship solely to things of an external nature. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That the altar was the chief representative 
of the Lord becomes clear also from the consideration that there were altars even among gentiles before all the other religious observances were established, before the Ark [of the Covenant] 
was made, and before the Temple was built. This is clear from Abram's going on to the mountain east of Bethel, erecting an altar, and calling on the name of Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2012:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 12:8</a>; from his being commanded 
to offer Isaac as a burnt offering on an altar, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2022:2,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 22:2, 9</a>, from Jacob's building an altar in Luz, which was Bethel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:6, 7</a>; and from Moses' building an altar at the foot of Mount Sinai and 
offering sacrifice, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:4-6</a> Each of these events took place before the establishment of the sacrificial system and before the construction of the Ark, the place where worship was at a later time 
celebrated in the wilderness. The fact that gentiles too had altars is clear from what is said about Balaam telling Balak to build seven altars and to prepare seven young bulls and seven rams, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:1-7,%2015-18,%2029,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:1-7, 15-18, 29, 30</a>, and also from the command to destroy the altars of the nations, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:5</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%202:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 2:2</a>. Consequently Divine worship involving the use of altars and sacrifices was not something 
new when it was established among the Jews. Indeed men were building altars, especially those for commemorative purposes, before they ever knew of immolating young bulls and other animals on them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
That 'altars' means a representative of the Lord, and 'burnt offerings' consequent worship of Him, is quite clear from the Prophets and also in Moses where Levi to whom the priesthood was entrusted 
is the subject,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will teach Jacob Your judgements and Israel Your law. They will put incense in Your nostrils, and whole (burnt offering) upon Your altar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for 
the whole of worship. 'Teaching Jacob His judgements, and Israel His law' stands for internal worship, while 'putting incense in His nostrils, and whole [burnt offering] on the altar' stands for corresponding 
external worship, and so for the whole of worship. In Isaiah, On that day a man will look to his Maker and his eyes will regard the Holy One of Israel. And he will not look to the altars, the 
work of his hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2017:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 17:7, 8</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'looking to the altars' clearly means representative worship in general, which was to be abolished. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that day there will be an altar 
to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here too 'altar' stands for external worship. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord has abandoned His 
altar, He has abhorred His sanctuary. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%201:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 1:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Altar' stands for representative worship which had become idolatrous. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, they have been to him 
altars for sinning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%208:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 8:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Altars' here stands for all representative worship separated from internal, and so stands for what is idolatrous. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The high places of Aven, 
the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. Thorn and thistle will grow up on their altars. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2010:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 10:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here too 'altars' stands for idolatrous worship. In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
On the day I visit Israel for his transgressions, 
I will visit the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar will be cut off. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%203:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 3:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'altars' stands for representative worship that had become idolatrous. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
They 
will bring me to Your holy mountain, and to Your dwellings! Then I will go in to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2043:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 43:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'altar' clearly stands for the Lord. So the 
making of an altar in the Ancient and the Jewish Churches stood for a representative of the Lord. Because worship of the Lord was carried out principally by means of burnt offerings and sacrifices, 
and these principally meant representative worship, it is clear that the altar itself means representative worship itself. </p>

Quod 'aedificavit Noah altare Jehovae' significet repraesentativum Domini, constat ex illis quae modo nunc dicta sunt.  Ritus omnes Ecclesiae Antiquae repraesentativi Domini erant, sicut etiam ritus 
Ecclesiae Judaicae; sed principale repraesentativum fuit postea altare, tum holocaustum, quod quia fiebat ex bestiis mundis et avibus mundis repraesentabat sicut significabat, bestiae mundae bona charitatis 
et aves mundae vera fidei; quae cum offerebantur, significabant apud Antiquam Ecclesiam quod offerrent Domino inde munera; Domino nihil aliud, quod gratum Ei sit, offerri potest: sed posteri, 
ut gentes, tum etiam Judaei, haec pervertebant, ne quidem scientes quod talia significarentur, cultum solum in externis ponentes.  [2] Quod 'altare' fuerit principale repraesentativum Domini, constare 
quoque inde potest quod antequam ceteri ritus instituti, et antequam arca exstructa, et antequam templum aedificatum, altaria fuerint, etiam inter gentes; de Abramo constat, 	Quod cum venerit in montem 
ab oriente Bethelis exstruxerit altare, et invocaverit nomen Jehovae,  Gen.  	xii 8; </p>
<p>	Quod ei jussum offerre Isaacum in holocaustum super altari: Gen. xxii 2, 9; </p>
<p>	Quod Jacobus aedificaverit altare 
ad Luz seu Bethel, Gen. xxxv 6, 7; </p>
<p>	Quod Moses aedificaverit altare sub Monte Sinai, et sacrificaverit, Exod. xxiv 4-6; </p>
<p>quod fuit antequam sacrificia instituta sunt, et antequam arca exstructa, ubi 
cultus dein peragebatur in deserto. Similiter quod altaria fuerint apud gentes, constat ex Bileamo, 	Qui ad Balakum dixit, quod aedificaret septem altaria, et pararet septem boves, et septem arietes, 
Num. xxiii 1-7, 15-18, 29, 30; </p>
<p>tum quod mandatum, quod gentium altaria destruerentur, ut Deut. vii 5; Jud. ii 2; quare cultus Divinus per altaria et sacrificia, non fuit novum quoddam institutum 
apud Judaeos. Immo altaria prius aedificata sunt quam noverunt super iis mactare boves et pecudes, et quidem in memoriale.  [3] Quod 'altaria' significent repraesentativum Domini, et 'holocausta' cultum 
Ipsius inde, constat manifeste apud Prophetas: ut apud Mosen de Levi cui sacerdotium, 	Docebunt judicia Tua Jacobum, et legem Tuam Israelem; ponent suffitum in naribus Tuis, et totum (holocaustum) 
super alteri Tuo, Deut. xxxiii 10; </p>
<p>ubi pro omni cultu; 'quod docerent judicia Jacobum, et legem Israelem' pro cultu interno; 'quod ponerent suffitum in naribus, et totum super altari' pro cultu externo 
correspondente; ita pro omni cultu: apud Esaiam, 	In die illo aspiciet homo ad Factorem suum, et oculi ejus ad Sanctum Israelis spectabunt; et non aspiciet ad altaria, opus manuum ejus, xvii 7, 8; </p>
<p>ubi 
'aspicere ad altaria' manifeste significat cultum repraesentativum in genere, qui aboleretur: apud eundem, 	In die illo erit altare Jehovae in medio terrae Aegypti, et statua juxta terminum ejus 
Jehovae, xix 19; </p>
<p>[4] ibi etiam 'altare' pro cultu externo: apud Jeremiam,                     Deseruit Dominus altare Suum, detestatus est sanctuarium     Suum, Thren. ii (x)7; </p>
<p>'altare' pro cultu 
repraesentativo, qui factus idololatricus: apud Hosheam, 	Multiplicavit Ephraim altaria ad peccandum; fuerant ei altaria ad peccandum, viii 11; </p>
<p>'altaria' ibi pro omni repraesentativo separato ab 
interno, sic pro idololatrico: apud eundem, 	Perdentur excelsa Aven, peccatum Israelis, spina et carduus ascendet super altaria eorum, x 8; </p>
<p>ibi etiam 'altaria' pro cultu idololatrico: apud Amos, 	In 
die visitare Me praevaricationes Israelis super eum, et visitabo super altaria Bethelis, et succidentur cornua 	altaris, iii 14; </p>
<p>ubi 'altaria' quoque pro repraesentativo facto idololatrico: [5] apud 
Davidem,                                                          	Deducent me ad montem sanctitatis Tuae, et ad habitacula Tua, et ingrediar ad altare Dei, ad Deum, laetitiam exsultationis meae, Ps. 
xliii 3, 4; </p>
<p>ubi 'altare' manifeste pro Domino; ita altaris constructio in Ecclesia Antiqua et Judaica, pro repraesentativo Domini; quia cultus Domini peragebatur principaliter per holocausta et sacrificia, 
et sic illa principaliter significabant cultum repraesentativum, constat quod ipsum altare significet ipsum repraesentativum. </p>
