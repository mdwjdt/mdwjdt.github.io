<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8882节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8882.</strong>“不可妄称耶和华你神的名”表对信之真理和良善的玷污和亵渎。这从“神的名”和“妄称”的含义清楚可知：“神的名”是指用来敬拜主的整体上的一切事物，因而是指一切信之真理和良善（参看<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>节）；“妄称”是指玷污和亵渎。准确来说，“妄称神的名”表示将真理变成邪恶，也就是相信它是真理，然而却过着邪恶的生活。它还表示将良善变成虚假，也就是活得圣洁，然而却不相信。这二者都是亵渎（<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>节），因为信属于理解力，而生活则属于意愿；因此在那些信与生活脱节的人里面，思维和意愿是分裂的。不过，意愿不断进入理解力，因为理解力是意愿的外在形式；也就是说，意愿显现在那里光中。正因如此，当一个人以一种方式思考，以另一种方式生活时，真理和邪恶，或良善与虚假彼此联结在一起；也就是说，与人同在的天堂事物与地狱事物联结在一起。这种联结无法解除，这个人也因此无法得以治愈，除非进行撕裂，这种撕裂会将一切属灵生命都带走。所以像这样的人就被送入最可怕的地狱，在那里遭受可怕的折磨。<br />这就是主在马太福音中所说这些话的意思：<br />人一切的罪和亵渎的话，都可得赦免；惟独亵渎圣灵，总不得赦免。凡说话干犯人子的，他还可得赦免；惟独说话干犯圣灵的，今世、来世总不得赦免。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.31.htm">12:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.32.htm">32</a>）<br />也是路加福音中这些话的意思：<br />污灵从人里面出来，走遍干旱之地，寻求安歇；既寻不着，便说，我要回到我所出来的屋里去。到了，就看见里面打扫干净，修饰好了，便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来，都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况比当初更不好了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.24.htm">11:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这些话描述了对来自主的真理的亵渎。“出来的污灵”表示对真理的承认和信仰；“打扫干净的屋子”表示违背真理的生活；“另带七个灵回去”表示一种亵渎的状态。这些就是“妄称神的名”所表示的事。人若陷入这种状态，就无法治愈，从而无法得到赦免，这一点也由接下来的话来表示，即：“因为妄称耶和华名的，耶和华必不以他为无罪”，这句话表示这事不得赦免。至于何为亵渎，以及谁会犯下亵渎罪，详情可参看前文（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1003.htm">1003</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="6348.htm">6348</a>，<a href="6595.htm">6595</a>，<a href="6959.htm">6959</a>，<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>，<a href="6971.htm">6971</a>，<a href="8394.htm">8394</a>节）。<br />“妄称神的名”也表示亵渎；当那些属于圣言或信之真理，因而神圣的事物遭到取笑，被拖进污秽的世俗事物，从而被玷污时，亵渎的事就会发生（参看<a href="4050.htm">4050</a>，<a href="5390.htm">5390</a>节）。但对不承认“神的名”所表示的任何信之良善或真理的犹太民族来说，“妄称神的名”表示他们把耶和华的名，以及吩咐给他们的诫命和律例用到偶像崇拜上，如他们在旷野就用到了对金牛犊的敬拜上；他们不仅向金牛犊献上燔祭和祭物，吃由此分别为圣的圣物，还称这一庆祝日为“耶和华的节日”，如我们在摩西五经中所读到的：<br />亚伦用金子铸了一只牛犊，他们就说，以色列啊，这些是你的神，是领你出埃及地的！亚伦看见它，就在它面前筑了一座坛，且宣告说，明日是耶和华的节日。次日清早，他们起来献燔祭，带圣餐供物。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.4.htm">32:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“必不以他们为无罪”表示那些通过如此行而妄称耶和华神名的人不得赦免，这一点从当时耶和华指着他们对摩西所说的话明显看出来，即：<br />谁得罪我，我就把谁从我的册子上抹去。现在你去领这百姓，往我所告诉你的地方去；只是在我追讨的日子，我必因他们的罪追讨他们。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.33.htm">32:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.34.htm">34</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8882</b></p><p><b>8882.</b>
Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain.* That this signifies profanations and blasphemings of the truth and good of faith, is evident from the signification of "the name of God," as 
being all in the complex by which the Lord is worshiped, thus all the truth and good of faith (see n. 2724, 3006, 6674); and from the signification of "taking in vain," as being to profane and blaspheme. 
By "taking the name of God in vain" is properly signified to turn truth into evil, that is, to believe that it is truth, and nevertheless to live in evil; and it also denotes to turn good into falsity, 
that is, to live holily, and yet not to believe. Both are profanation (n. 4601), for believing is of the understanding, and living is of the will; and therefore in those who believe otherwise than 
they live, the thought and will are divided. But as the will continually flows into the understanding, for the understanding is the form of the will; that is, the will manifests itself there in light; 
therefore it is that when a man believes in one way and lives in another, truth and evil, or good and falsity, are conjoined; thus the things that are of heaven with man are conjoined with those which 
are of hell. This conjunction cannot be dissolved, and thereby the man be healed, except by a pulling asunder which carries away with it everything of spiritual life; and therefore these persons 
are sent into a hell the most grievous of all, where they are direfully tormented. [2] This is what is meant by the words of the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     All sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; 
but the blasphemy of the spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. If anyone shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but he who shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall 
not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come (Matt. 12:31, 32). Also by these words in Luke: </p>
<p>     When the unclean spirit hath gone out of a man, he goeth through dry places, 
seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out. And if on coming he findeth it swept and garnished, he goeth away and taketh seven other spirits worse than 
himself: and they enter in and dwell there; and the man's last things become worse than the first (Luke 11:24-26). [3] By these words is described the profanation of truth from the Lord; by "the unclean 
spirit when he goeth out" is meant the acknowledgment and faith of truth; by "the house swept" is meant a life contrary to truths; by "his return with seven other spirits" is meant a state of profanation. 
These are the things which are signified by "taking the name of God in vain." That such a state with man cannot be healed, thus cannot be forgiven, is signified also by the words which immediately 
follow, namely, "Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain," by which is meant that it cannot be forgiven. (For further information about the nature of profanation, and who 
are guilty of it, see n. 593, 1003, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3399, 3402, 3489, 6348, 6595, 6959, 6963, 6971, 8394.) [4] By "taking the name of God in vain" is also signified 
blasphemy, which takes place when those things which are of the Word, or of the doctrine of faith, thus which are holy, are held in derision, and are debased to unclean earthly things, and thus are defiled 
(see n. 4050, 5390). But by "taking the name of God in vain," relatively to the Israelitish nation, which did not acknowledge any good and truth of faith (which are signified by "the name of God"), 
is meant the applying of the name of Jehovah, and also of the commandments and statutes which were commanded them, to the worship of idols, as they did in the wilderness to the worship of the golden 
calf, unto which they not only offered burnt offerings and sacrifices, and ate of the things sanctified thereby, but also called the day of its celebration "a feast to Jehovah," as we read in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    Aaron made of the gold a molten calf, and they said, These be thy gods, Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation, 
and said, Tomorrow is a feast to Jehovah. And therefore they rose up in the morning of the next day, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought things eucharistic (Exod. 32:4-6). [5] That those 
who thus took the name of Jehovah God in vain could not be forgiven, which is signified by their "not being held guiltless," is evident from the words of Jehovah to Moses at that time concerning 
them, namely: </p>
<p>     Him that hath sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book. Nevertheless go, lead this people in unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; but in the day of My visitation I 
will visit their sin upon them (Exod. 32:33, 34). * Here in vanum, but in the head Chapter and in n. 8863 ad vanum. [REVISER.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8882</b></p><p><b>8882.</b>
'You shall not take the name of your God in vain' means instances in which the truth or the good of faith is profaned or blasphemed. This is clear from the meaning of 'the name of God' as everything 
in its entirety with which the Lord is worshipped, thus every truth or good of faith, dealt with in <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>; and from the meaning of 'taking in vain' as profaning and blaspheming. To be precise 
'taking God's name in vain' means turning what is true into what is bad, that is, believing it to be true and yet living a bad life. It is also turning what is good into what is false, that is, living 
in a holy manner and yet not believing. Both are forms of profanation, <a href="4601.htm">4601</a>. Belief belongs to the understanding and life to the will; consequently thought and will in people whose belief is out of 
keeping with their life are divided. But the will is entering constantly into the understanding, for the understanding is the outward form assumed by the will, that is, the will brings itself to light 
there. This being so, when a person thinks in one way and lives in another, truth and evil or goodness and falsity are combined with each other; that is, things of heaven with a person are combined 
with those of hell. This combination cannot be dissolved, and so the person cannot be healed, except by a tearing apart which takes away with it everything of spiritual life. Therefore people who are 
like this are sent to the most horrible hell of all, where they suffer dreadful torments. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is how the Lord's words in Matthew should be understood, </p>
<blockquote>
Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven 
people, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven people. If anyone speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be 
forgiven him, either in this age or in the one to come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:31,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:31, 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also by these words in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person he passes through dry places seeking rest 
- and if he does not find any he says, I will return to my house out of which I came. And if when he comes he finds it swept and decorated, he goes away and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, 
and they enter in and dwell there. And the last things of the person become worse than the first. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:24-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:24-26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 By these words the Lord is describing the profanation of truth. 'When the 
unclean spirit goes out' is used to mean acknowledgement of and real belief in truth, 'the house which has been swept' to mean a life contrary to truths, and 'his coming back with seven others' to mean 
a state of profanation. These are the things which are meant by 'taking God's name in vain'. The fact that the person cannot be healed from such a condition and so receive forgiveness is also meant 
by the words following immediately after - 'Jehovah will not render him innocent who takes His name in vain' - which are used to mean that this thing cannot be forgiven. For more about what profanation 
is and with whom it exists, see <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1003.htm">1003</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>, <a href="3402.htm">3402</a>, <a href="3489.htm">3489</a>, <a href="6348.htm">6348</a>, <a href="6595.htm">6595</a>, <a href="6960.htm">6960</a>, <a href="6963.htm">6963</a>, <a href="6971.htm">6971</a>, <a href="8394.htm">8394</a> </p>

<p><b>[4]</b>
 'Taking God's name in vain' also means blasphemy, 
which takes place when fun is poked at those things which belong to the Word or to religious teachings and belief, thus which are holy, and they are dragged through the mud and thereby defiled, dealt 
with in <a href="4050.htm">4050</a>, <a href="5390.htm">5390</a>. But in respect of the Israelite nation, which did not acknowledge any good or truth of faith meant by 'God's name', their use of Jehovah's name, and also of the commandments and 
statutes they were commanded, in the worship of idols is meant by 'taking God's name in vain'. It was what they did in the wilderness when they worshipped the golden calf; they not only presented it 
burnt offerings and sacrifices, and ate of consecrated elements from them, but also called the day of that celebration 'a feast to Jehovah' This is recorded in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Aaron made out of 
the gold a molded calf, and they said, These are your gods, O Israel. who caused you to come up out of the land of Egypt. When Aaron saw it he built an altar in front of it, and made a proclamation and 
said, Tomorrow there will be a feast to Jehovah. Therefore they rose up in the morning of the next day and presented burnt offerings and brought eucharistic offerings. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:4-6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Jehovah's words 
at the time, concerning those who had taken the name of Jehovah God in vain by doing all this, make it clear that they could not be forgiven, meant by their not being rendered innocent. Those words 
spoken to Moses are, </p>
<blockquote>
Him who has sinned against Me I will blot out of My book. All the same, go, lead this people to the place of which I have spoken to you. But on the day of My visitation, I will 
visit them for their sin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:33,%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:33, 34</a>.

`Non feres nomen Dei tui in vanum': quod significet profanationes et blasphemationes {1} veri et boni fidei, constat ex significatione `nominis Dei' quod sit omne in complexu quo colitur Dominus, ita 
omne verum et bonum fidei, de qua n. 2724, 3006, 6674, et ex significatione `ferre in vanum' quod sit profanare et blasphemare; per `ferre nomen Dei in vanum' proprie significatur vertere verum in malum, 
hoc est, credere quod verum sit et usque vivere in malo, et quoque est vertere bonum in falsum, hoc est, vivere sancte et tamen non credere; utrumque est profanatio, n. 4601, nam credere est intellectus 
et vivere est voluntatis; quare in illis qui credunt aliter quam vivunt, cogitatio et voluntas divisae sunt; at quia voluntas continue influit in intellectum, nam intellectus est forma voluntatis, 
hoc est, voluntas se manifestat ibi in luce, inde est cum homo aliter credit et aliter vivit, (d)quod verum et malum, aut {2} bonum et falsum, conjungantur, ita illa quae caeli sunt apud hominem 
cum iis quae inferni; conjunctio haec non resolvi potest, et sic sanari homo, quam per distractionem quae secum aufert omne {3} vitae spiritualis; quare illi {4} mittuntur in infernum omnium atrocissimum, 
ubi dire cruciuntur {5}; [2] hoc est quod intelligitur per Domini verba apud Matthaeum, 	Omne peccatum et blasphemia remittetur hominibus, Spiritus vero blasphemia non remittetur hominibus; si 
quis dixerit verbum contra Filium hominis, remittetur illi, qui vero dixerit contra Spiritum sanctum, non remittetur illi neque in hoc saeculo neque in futuro, xii 31, 32; </p>
<p>ut et per haec apud Lucam, 	Quando 
immundus spiritus exiverit ex homine, peragrat sicca loca quaerens requiem; quam si non invenit, dicit, Revertar in domum meam unde egressus sum; quam si veniens invenit {6} scopis purgatam et 
ornatam, tunc abit et assumit septem alios spiritus se ipso pejores, et ingressi habitant ibi, et fiunt extrema hominis pejora primis, xi 24-26; </p>
<p>[3] per haec describitur profanatio veri a Domino; per 
`immundum spiritum cum exit' intelligitur agnitio et fides veri, et per `domum scopis purgatam' vita contra vera; per `reditum ejus cum septem aliis' status profanationis; haec sunt quae significantur 
per `ferre nomen (x)Dei in vanum; quod tale apud hominem non sanari possit, ita non remitti, significatur (o)etiam per verba ibi immediate sequentia, nempe {7}, 	Non innocentem {8} reddet Jehovah 
illum qui fert nomen Ipsius in vanum, per quae intelligitur quod (c)id non remitti possit; praeterea {9} quid profanatio, et apud quos, videatur n. 593, 1003, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 
3398, 3399, 3402, 3489, 6348, 6595, 6960, 6963, 6971, 8394. 	[4] Per `ferre nomen Dei in vanum' etiam significatur blasphematio, quae fit cum illa quae Verbi sunt aut doctrinae fidei, ita quae sancta, 
ludibrio habentur et deducuntur ad immunda terrestria, et sic conspurcantur, de quibus n. 4050, 5390.  At per `ferre nomen Dei in vanum' respective ad gentem Israeliticam, quae non agnovit aliquod 
bonum et verum fidei, quae significantur per `nomen Dei,' intelligitur applicatio nominis Jehovae, et quoque praeceptorum et statutorum quae illis mandata sunt, ad cultum idolorum; sicut fecerunt in 
deserto ad cultum vituli aurei, cui non modo holocausta et sacrificia offerebant, et ex sanctificatis inde comedebant {10},sed etiam diem celebrationis ejus vocabant `festum Jehovae'; de quo apud Moschen, 	Aharon 
fecit vitulum fusilis ex auro, et dixerunt, Hi sunt dii tui, Israel, qui ascendere fecerunt te e terra Aegypti; quod cum videret Aharon, exstruxit altare coram eo, et proclamavit et dixit, 
Festum Jehovae cras; quare surrexerunt mane postridie, et obtulerunt holocausta, et adduxerunt eucharistica, Exod. xxxii 4-6. 	[5] Quod illis qui ita tulerunt nomen Jehovae Dei in vanum, non remitti 
potuerit, quod significatur per quod non innocentes reddentur, constat {11} a Jehovae verbis ad Moschen de illis tunc, quae sunt, 	Illum qui peccaverit Mihi, delebo e libro Meo; verumtamen vade,
