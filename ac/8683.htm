Verses 13-16. And it was on the morrow, and Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening. And Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, 
and he said, What is this word that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou alone, and all the people standing over thee from the morning until the evening? And Moses said to his father-in-law, 
Because the people cometh unto me to inquire of God; when they have a word, it cometh unto me; and I judge between a man and his companion, and I make known the judgments of God, and His laws. "And it 
was on the morrow," signifies what is eternal; "and Moses sat to judge the people," signifies the disposing of truth Divine with those who were of the spiritual church in the state before it was from 
good; "and the people stood over Moses," signifies obedience then in conformity with truth Divine; "from the morning until the evening," signifies in every state then interiorly and exteriorly; "and 
Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people," signifies the omniscience of Divine good; "and he said, Why sittest thou alone?" signifies that there was no influx of truth from good from any 
other source; "and all the people standing over thee from the morning until the evening," signifies that at that time this was the source of everything of will with those who were of the spiritual church, 
in every state; "and Moses said to his father-in-law," signifies the reciprocity that is in the answer; "Because the people cometh unto me to inquire of God," signifies that they do not will and 
act from any other source than from the fact that the Word has so said; "when they have a word," signifies in everything that befalls; "it cometh unto me, and I judge between a man and his companion," 
signifies that at this time they are disposed in conformity with revealed truth; "and I make known the judgments of God, and His laws," signifies that from this source they are taught what is true 
and what is good. </p>

Verses 13-16 And so it was, on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening. And the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he was doing for 
the people, and he said, What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people are standing before you from morning until evening? And Moses said to his father-in-law, 
Because the people come to me to inquire of God. When they have a matter they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbour<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>; and I make known the judgements of God and His laws. </p>
<p>'And 
so it was, on the morrow' means what is eternal. 'That Moses sat to judge the people' means the arrangement, effected by God's truth, with those belonging to the spiritual Church in the state 
before their actions sprang from good. 'And the people stood before Moses' means obedience at that time to God's truth. 'From morning until evening' means in every state at that time, inwardly and outwardly. 
'And the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he was doing for the people' means the complete knowledge Divine Good possessed. 'And he said, [What is this thing that you are doing for the people?] 
Why do you sit alone?' means that it existed without any truth from good flowing in from another source. 'And all the people are standing before you from morning until evening' means that at this 
time it was the source of every act of the will which those belonging to the spiritual Church possessed, in every state. 'And Moses said to his father-in-law' means reciprocation in response. 'Because 
the people come to me to inquire of God' means that nothing else governs their will and actions than that which the Word has declared to be so. 'When they have a matter' means in everything that comes 
about. 'They come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbour' means that revealed truth at this time brought about the arrangement existing among them. 'And I make known the judgements of God 
and His laws' means that it teaches them what truth is and what good is.

Vers. 13-16.  Et fuit crastino, et sedit Moscheh ad judicandum populum, et stetit populus super Moschen a mane usque ad vesperam.  Et vidit socer Moschis omne quod ille faciens populo, et dixit, Quodnam 
verbum hoc quod tu facis populo? quare tu sedes solus tu, et omnis populus stans super te a mane usque ad vesperam?  Et dixit Moscheh socero suo, Quia venit ad me populus ad inquirendum Deum.  Cum 
est illis verbum, venit ad me, et judico inter virum et inter socium ejus, et nota facio judicia Dei et leges Ipsius.  `Et fuit crastino' significat aeternum: `et {1}sedit Moscheh ad judicandum populum' 
significat veri Divini dispositionem apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in statu antequam ex bono: `et stetit populus super Moschen' significat oboedientiam tunc ex vero Divino: `a mane usque 
ad vesperam' significat in omni statu {2}tunc interius et exterius: `et vidit socer Moschis omne quod ille faciens populo' significat omniscientiam Divini Boni: `et dixit, Quare tu sedes solus?' significat 
quod absque influxu veri ex bono aliunde: `et omnis populus stans super te a mane usque ad vesperam' significat quod inde tunc omne voluntatis illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, in omni statu: `et 
dixit Moscheh socero suo' significat reciprocum quod responso: `Quia venit ad me populus ad inquirendum Deum' significat quod non aliunde (x)velint et agant quam ex eo quod Verbum ita dixit: `cum est 
illis verbum' significat in omni quod obvenit: `venit ad me, et judico inter virum et inter socium ejus' significat quod ex vero revelato tunc disponantur: `et nota facio judicia Dei et leges Ipsius'
