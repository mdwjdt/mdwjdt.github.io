<p><strong>[NCE]1439.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1439/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_6" target=_top>Genesis 12:6</a>. And Abram passed through the land all the way to the place of Shechem, all the way to the oak grove of Moreh. (And the Canaanite was then in the land.)<br />Abram passed through the land all the way to the place of Shechem symbolizes the Lord's second state, when the heavenly qualities of love symbolized by Shechem would appear to him. All the way to the oak grove of Moreh symbolizes his third state: the dawn of perception, which is the oak grove of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land symbolizes the evil in his outer self that he inherited from his mother. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1439</b></p><p><b>1439.</b>
Verse 6. And Abram passed through the land, even unto the place Shechem, even unto the oak-grove Moreh: and the Canaanite was then in the land. "Abram passed through the land, even unto the place Shechem" 
signifies the Lord's second state, when the celestial things of love became apparent to Him, which are signified by "Shechem;" "even unto the oak-grove Moreh," signifies the third state, namely, 
the first perception, which is "the oak-grove Moreh;" "and the Canaanite was then in the land," signifies the evil heredity from the mother in His external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1439</b></p><p><b>1439.</b>
Verse 6 And Abram went through the land as far as the place of Shechem, as far as the oak-grove of Moreh. And the Canaanite was at that time in the land. </p>
<p>'Abram went through the land as far as the 
place of Shechem' means the Lord's second state, when the celestial things of love, which are meant by Shechem, became apparent to Him. 'As far as the oak-grove of Moreh' means a third state, namely 
a first perception, which is 'the oak-grove of Moreh'. 'And the Canaanite was at that time in the land' means the hereditary evil from the mother, in His external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1439</b>
</p><b>1439.</b>
Vers. 6.  Et transivit Abram per terram usque ad locum Shechem, usque ad quercetum Moreh; et Canaanita tunc in terra. 'Transivit Abram per terram usque ad locum Shechem' significat alterum statum Domini, 
cum caelestia amoris Ipsi apparerent quae significantur per 'Shechem':  'usque ad quercetum Moreh' significat tertium statum, nempe primam perceptionem, quae est 'quercetum Moreh':  'et Canaanita 
tunc in terra' significat hereditarium a matre malum in externo Ipsius homine. </p>
