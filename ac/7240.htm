<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7240节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7240.</strong>“当耶和华在埃及地对摩西说话的日子”表那时教会的状态，就是当命令通过从神来的律法被赐给那些属于主的属灵国度的人，然而他们仍与地狱里的人非常接近的时候。这从“日子”、“耶和华说话”和“埃及地”的含义，以及“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“日子”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>，<a href="6110.htm">6110</a>节），在此是指教会的状态，因为所论述的主题就是这个教会；“耶和华说话”是指命令，在此是指赐给那些属于主的属灵国度之人的命令；“摩西”是指从神来的律法（<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>节）；“埃及地”是指那些属于主的属灵国度的人被虚假侵扰所在的地方。这个地方在接近地狱的低地（参看<a href="7090.htm">7090</a>节）。以色列人所在、被称为“歌珊地”的“埃及地”表示那低地；但埃及人所在的地方表示周围的地狱，虚假侵扰的源头。</p>

And it was in the day that Jehovah spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt. That this signifies the state of the church then, when commandment was given through the law from the Divine to those who were 
of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, when yet they were in proximity to those who are in the hells, is evident from the signification of "day," as being state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 
3785, 4850, 6110), here the state of the church, because this is the subject treated of; from the signification of "Jehovah spoke," as being a command, here to those of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; 
from the representation of Moses, as being the law from the Divine (n. 6771, 6827); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being where they who were of the Lord's spiritual kingdom were 
infested by falsities; that this was in the lower earth, which is near the hells, may be seen above (n. 7090). The land of Egypt, where the sons of Israel were, and which was called "Goshen," signifies 
that lower earth; but where the Egyptians were, signifies the hells around, from which came the infestations by falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7240</b></p><p><b>7240.</b>
'And so it was on the day Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt' means the state of the Church at that time, when the command was given through the law from God to those who belonged to the Lord's 
spiritual kingdom, when they were still in close proximity to those in hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'the day' as the state, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>, <a href="6110.htm">6110</a>, here the state of the Church since that is the subject; from the meaning of 'Jehovah speaking' as the command, here the command given to those who belonged to the Lord's spiritual kingdom; from 
the representation of 'Moses' as the law from God, dealt with in <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the place where those who belonged to the Lord's spiritual kingdom were molested 
by falsities. This place was on the lower earth, which is next to the hells, see <a href="7090.htm">7090</a>. 'The land of Egypt' where the children of Israel were, and which was called Goshen, means that lower earth; 
but the place where the Egyptians were means the surrounding hells, the source of the molestations by falsities.  </p>

`Et fuit in die illo locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen in terra Aegypti': quod significet statum tunc Ecclesiae cum mandatum est per legem a Divino ad illos qui e regno spirituali Domini, cum adhuc in 
propinquitate essent illis qui in infernis, constat ex significatione `diei' quod sit status, de qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850, 6110, hic status Ecclesiae quia de {1}illo agitur; 
ex significatione `loqui Jehovah' quod sit mandatum, hic ad illos qui e regno spirituali Domini; ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit lex a Divino, de qua n. 6771, 6827; et ex significatione `terrae 
Aegypti' quod sit ubi illi qui e regno spirituali Domini infestati sunt a falsis; quod hoc fuerit in terra inferiore, quae propinqua infernis, videatur n. 7090; `terra Aegypti' ubi filii Israelis 
erant, et vocabatur Goschen, significat terram illam inferiorem; sed ubi Aegyptii, significat inferna circum, (c)e quibus infestationes {2}a falsis. 	@1 illa$ 	@2 per falsa$ </p>
