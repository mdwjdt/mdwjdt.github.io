Verses 18-23. The feast of unleavened things shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed of the month Abib; because in the month Abib thou 
wentest forth from Egypt. Everything that openeth the womb is mine; and of all thy cattle thou shalt give the male, that openeth of ox and of small cattle. And that which openeth of an ass thou shalt 
redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, thou shalt break its neck. Every firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And My faces shall not be seen empty. Six days thou shalt work, and on the 
seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest. And the feast of weeks thou shalt make to thee of the firstfruits of wheat harvest; and the feast of ingathering at the revolving 
of the year. Three times in the year shall every male of thine be seen before the faces of the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel. "The feast of unleavened things shalt thou keep," signifies the worship 
of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of liberation from evil and from the falsities of evil; "seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things," signifies a holy state then, and the appropriation of 
Divine truth purified from evil and from the falsities of evil; "as I commanded thee," signifies according to Divine order; "at the time appointed of the month Abib," signifies a new state; "because 
in the month Abib thou wentest forth from Egypt," signifies because there was then liberation from hell; "everything that openeth the womb is Mine," signifies that all the good of innocence, of charity, 
and of faith is to be ascribed to the Lord; "and of all thy cattle thou shalt give the male," signifies that it is given by means of truth; "that openeth of ox and of small cattle," signifies in the 
external and in the internal man; "and that which openeth of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb," signifies that faith merely natural must not be ascribed to the Lord; "and if thou wilt not redeem 
it, thou shalt break its neck," signifies that if the truth of innocence is not therein, it must be separated and cast out; "every firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem, "signifies that the truths 
of faith which are without good must not be ascribed to the Lord; "and My faces shall not be seen empty," signifies reception from mercy, and thanksgiving; "six days thou shalt work," signifies the first 
state of regeneration, when the man is in truths, and is at that time in combats; "and on the seventh day thou shalt rest," signifies the second state of regeneration, when the man is in good and 
is then in peace; "in plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest," signifies in respect to the implanting of truth in good and its reception; "and the feast of weeks thou shalt make to thee of the firstfruits 
of wheat harvest," signifies the worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of the implanting of truth in good; "and the feast of ingathering at the revolving of the year," signifies regeneration, 
and complete liberation from damnation; "three times in the year shall every male of thine be seen before the faces of the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel," signifies the continuous manifestation 
and presence of the Lord in the truths of faith also. </p>

Verses 18-23  You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat the unleavened bread that I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, because in the month of Abib 
you came out of Egypt. All that opens the womb<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is Mine, and of all your cattle you are to give the male, whatever opens [the womb] among oxen and small cattle<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>. And whatever opens [the womb] among 
asses<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> you shall redeem with [one of] the small cattle; and if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And My face shall not be seen empty-handed<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a>. 
Six days you shall work, and on the seventh day you shall rest; in ploughing and in harvesting you shall rest<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a>. And you shall keep the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, 
and the feast of ingathering at the end<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> of the year. Three times in the year all your males shall be seen at the face of the Lord, Jehovah, the God of Israel. </p>
<p>'You shall keep the feast 
of unleavened bread' means worship of the Lord and thanksgiving on account of deliverance from evil and from the falsities of evil. 'Seven days you shall eat the unleavened bread' means a holy state 
then, and making Divine Truth, purified from evil and from the falsities of evil, one's own. 'That I commanded you' means in accordance with Divine order. 'At the appointed time in the month of Abib' 
means a new state. 'Because in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt' means because then there was deliverance from hell. 'All that opens the womb is Mine' means that all the good of innocence, charity, 
and faith is to be ascribed to the Lord. 'Of all your cattle you are to give the male' means which is imparted by means of truth. 'Whatever opens [the womb] among oxen and small cattle' means present 
in the external and internal man. 'And whatever opens [the womb] among asses you shall redeem with [one of] the small cattle' means that merely natural faith must not be ascribed to the Lord, [only 
the truth of innocence present within it.] 'And if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck' means that if the truth of innocence is not present within it, it is to be separated and cast aside. 
'All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem' means that the truths of faith devoid of good are not to be ascribed to the Lord. 'And My face shall not be seen empty-handed' means the reception 
[of what is given] out of mercy, and thanksgiving. 'Six days you shall work' means the first state of regeneration, when a person is in possession of truths and at that stage is engaged in conflicts. 
'And on the seventh day you shall rest' means the second state of regeneration, when a person is governed by good and at this stage experiences peace. 'In ploughing and harvesting you shall rest' means 
so far as the implanting of truth in good and the reception of that truth are concerned. 'And you shall keep the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of the wheat harvest' means worship of the Lord 
and thanksgiving on account of the implanting of truth in good. 'And the feast of ingathering at the end of the year' means [the worship of a thankful mind on account of the implanting of good after that, 
and so on account of] regeneration and complete deliverance from damnation. 'Three times in the year all your males shall be seen at the face of the Lord, Jehovah, the God of Israel' means the Lord's 
constant appearance and presence in the truths of faith as well.

Vers. 18-23.  Festum azymorum custodies; septem diebus comedes azyma quae praecepi tibi, ad statum tempus mensis Abib, quia in mense Abib exivisti ex Aegypto.  Omnis apertura uteri Mihi, et ex omni 
pecore tuo des masculum, aperturam bovis et pecudis.  Et aperturam asini redimes in pecude, et si non redemeris, decollabis illam; omnem primogenitum filiorum tuorum redimes; et non videbuntur facies 
Meae {1}vacue.  Sex diebus operaberis, et in die septimo quiesces, in aratione et in messatione quiesces.  Et festum septimanarum facies tibi primitiarum messis tritici, et festum collectionis revolutionis 
anni.  Tribus vicibus in anno videbitur omnis masculus tuus ad facies Domini Jehovae Dei Israelis.  `Festum azymorum custodies' significat cultum Domini et gratiarum actionem ob liberationem a malo 
et a falsis mali:  `septem diebus comedes azyma' significat statum sanctum tunc ac appropriationem Divini Veri purificati a malo et a falsis mali:  `quae praecepi tibi' significat secundum ordinem

 `et aperturam asini redimes in pecude' significat quod fides mere naturalis non addicabitur Domino:  `et si non redemeris, decollabis (illam)' significat si non inibi verum innocentiae, quod separanda 
et ejicienda:  `omnem primogenitum filiorum tuorum redimes' significat quod vera fidei quae absque bono, non addicanda Domino:  `et non videbuntur facies Meae vacue' significat receptionem ex misericordia 
et gratiarum actionem:  `sex diebus operaberis' significat statum primum regenerationis, cum homo est in veris et tunc in pugnis:  `et in die septimo quiesces' significat statum alterum regenerationis, 
cum homo est in bono et tunc in pace:  `in aratione et messatione quiesces' significat quoad implantationem veri in bono ac ejus receptionem:  `et festum septimanarum facies tibi primitiarum 
messis tritici' significat cultum Domini et gratiarum actionem propter implantationem veri in bono:  `et festum collectionis revolutionis anni' significat (cultum ex grato animo ob implantationem 
boni inde, ita ob) regenerationem et plenariam liberationem a damnatione:  `tribus vicibus in anno videbitur omnis masculus tuus ad facies Domini Jehovae Dei Israelis' significat continuam apparentiam
