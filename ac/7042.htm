<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7042节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7042.</strong>“耶和华遇见他”表反对。这从“遇见”的含义清楚可知，“遇见”是指反对，即反对在这个民族中间建立任何教会。当经上说“耶和华遇见他”时，所表示的是反对神性。根据字义来判断，似乎耶和华或神性是反对者，因为经上说“耶和华遇见他”。但内义却是，这是对神性的一种反对；因为神性从来不反对任何人。相反，是这个人或这个民族反对神性；当他们反对时，由于他们无法承受神性，所以表面上看，似乎有来自神性的抵制。此中情形从那些进入来世后渴望上天堂，却不能留在那里的人身上可以看出来。当他们的愿望实现，他们在路上，接近天堂入口时，他们觉得自己就像怪物，并开始感到痛苦和折磨，因为他们无法承受那里的真理和良善。他们以为天堂和神性反对他们；而事实上，是他们给自己带来这种反对，因为他们有一个反对的心态。由此也可以看出，神性不反对任何人，而是人自己反对神性。</p>

That Jehovah met him. That this signifies opposition, is evident from the signification of "meeting," as being opposition, namely, to the possibility of any church being instituted with that nation. 
That it denotes opposition against the Divine, is signified by "Jehovah met him." From the sense of the letter it appears as if Jehovah or the Divine set Himself in opposition, because it is said that 
"Jehovah met him;" but the internal sense is that the opposition was against the Divine. For the Divine never opposes itself to anyone, but it is the man, or the nation, which opposes itself to the Divine; 
and when it opposes itself, as it cannot endure the Divine, it appears as if there were resistance by the Divine. How the case herein is can be seen from those who come into the other life, and 
desire to come into heaven, and yet are not such as to be capable of being there. When they are permitted to attempt what they desire, even when they are in the way and near to the entrance into heaven, 
they appear to themselves as monsters, and begin to be in anguish and torment, because they cannot endure the truth and good which are there; and they believe that heaven and the Divine have opposed 
themselves to them; when yet it is they who bring this upon themselves, because they are in what is the opposite. From this also it can be seen that the Divine does not oppose itself to anyone, but 
that it is the man who opposes himself to the Divine. </p>

'And Jehovah came to meet him' means opposition. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming to meet' as opposition, opposition to the establishment of any Church among that nation. Opposition to the Divine 
is what is meant when it says that Jehovah came to meet him. To judge from the sense of the letter it seems as though Jehovah or the Divine was the opposer, since it says 'Jehovah came to meet him'. 
But the internal sense is that it was an opposition to the Divine; for the Divine never places Himself in opposition to anyone. Rather it is the person or nation who place themselves in opposition 
to the Divine; and when they do so it seems, because they cannot abide the Divine, as though there were resistance from the Divine. What this is like may be recognized from those who enter the next 
life and wish to enter heaven, yet are not the kind of people who can stay there. When their wish is granted and they are on their way, near the entrance to heaven, they seem to themselves to be like 
monsters and begin to feel pain and torment because they cannot abide the truth and goodness that are there. They think that heaven and the Divine have placed themselves in opposition to them, when in 
fact they are the ones, having an opposite attitude of mind, who bring it on themselves. From this one may also see that the Divine does not place Himself in opposition to anyone, but that it is a person 
who places himself in opposition to the Divine. </p>

`Et occurrit illi Jehovah': quod significet oppositionem, constat ex significatione `occurrere' quod sit oppositio, quod nempe aliqua Ecclesia apud gentem illam institui posset; quod oppositio sit contra 
Divinum, significatur per quod Jehovah illi occurrerit; ex sensu litterae apparet sicut Jehovah seu Divinum Se opposuerit, quia dicitur quod `occurrerit illi Jehovah'; sed sensus internus est quod 
oppositio fuerit contra Divinum; Divinum erum nusquam Se opponit alicui, sed est homo seu gens quae se opponit Divino, et cum se opponit, quia non sustinet Divinum, apparet sicut foret resistentia 
a Divino; {1}quomodo hoc se habet, constare potest ab illis qui in alteram vitam veniunt et cupiunt venire in caelum, et tamen non tales sunt ut ibi esse queant; cum illis permittitur {2}quod cupiunt, 
tunc cum in via sunt et prope ad introitum in caelum, apparent sibi ut monstra et incipiunt angi et cruciari, quia non sustinent verum et bonum quae ibi, {3} et credunt quod caelum et Divinum Se illis 
opposuerit cum tamen illi sunt, quia in opposito sunt, qui hoc sibi inferunt.  Inde quoque constare potest quod Divinum non Se alicui opponat, sed quod homo sit qui se opponit Divino. 	@1 se habet 
hoc sicut illi$ 	@2 ut in coelum veniant$ 	@3 i idcirco se retro praecipitant$ </p>
