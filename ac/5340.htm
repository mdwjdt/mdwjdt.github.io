<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5340节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5340.</strong>“约瑟聚敛七年一切的粮食”表在最初阶段增多、与良善联结的真理的保存。这从“聚敛”和“粮食”的含义清楚可知。“聚敛”在此是指保存；因为经上说，约瑟把粮食积蓄，收存在各城，就是各城中，以此表示他把它储存在内层，由此保存起来；事实上，它是以备荒年之用的。“粮食”是指滋养内在人的一切事物，即良善与真理。这粮食就是良善与真理，这从滋养外在人的属世食物与滋养内在人的属灵食物的对应关系明显看出来。故此处所表示的是与良善联结的真理，因为这就是那被保存并储存在人的内层里面的东西。“七年”表示当真理增多时的最初阶段（<a href="5339.htm">5339</a>节）。由此明显可知，“约瑟聚敛七年一切的粮食”表示在最初阶段增多、与良善联结的真理的保存。<br />虽然我们说“与良善联结的真理的保存”，但由于很少有人知道何为与良善联结的真理，更不知道真理如何并且何时与良善联结，故有必要对此加以说明。当人在为了真理与良善，而非自我或世界而向邻人行善的过程中感觉到快乐时，真理就与良善联结起来了。当人处于这种情感时，他所听闻或读到或思考的真理便与良善相联结；这一点通常从对关注这一目的的真理的情感看出来。</p>

And he gathered together all the food of the seven years. That this signifies the preservation of truth adjoined to good multiplied during the first times, is evident from the signification of "gathering 
together," as here being to preserve; for he gathered it together and put it in the cities and in the midst, and by this is signified that he stored it up in the interiors, thus that he preserved 
it, for it came into use in the years of famine; and from the signification of "food," as being all that by which the internal man is nourished. That this is good and truth, is evident from the correspondence 
of the earthly food by which the outward man is nourished, with the spiritual food by which the internal man is nourished. Here therefore it is truth adjoined to good, for this is what is preserved 
and stored up in the interiors.  By the "seven years" are signified the first states when truths are multiplied (n. 5339). From this it is plain that the preservation of truth adjoined to good, 
multiplied during the first times, is signified by "he gathered together all the food of the seven years." It is said "the preservation of truth adjoined to good," but as few know what truth adjoined 
to good is, and still less how and when truth is adjoined to good, something must be said about it. Truth is conjoined with good when a man feels delight in doing well to the neighbor for the sake 
of what is true and good, and not for the sake of self or the world. When a man is in this affection, the truths he hears or reads or thinks are conjoined with good, as is usually noticeable from the 
affection of truth for the sake of that end. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5340</b></p><p><b>5340.</b>
'And he gathered all the food of the seven years' means the preservation of truth linked to good, multiplied in the initial phases. This is clear from the meaning of gathering' here as preserving (for 
it says that he gathered it and laid it up in the cities, in the midst of them, which means that he stored it in the interior parts and thereby preserved it; for it was put to use in the years of famine); 
from the meaning of the food' as everything by which the internal man is nourished, namely good and truth, as may be recognized from the correspondence of earthly food which nourishes the external 
man with spiritual food which nourishes the internal man. Here therefore truth linked to good is meant, because this is what is preserved and stored away in a person's interior parts. 'Seven years' 
means the initial phases, when truths become multiplied, <a href="5339.htm">5339</a>. From all this it is evident that 'he gathered all the food of the seven years' means the preservation of truth linked to good, multiplied 
in the initial phases. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression 'the preservation of truth linked to good' is used, but because few are aware of what truth linked to good is, let alone of how and when truth becomes linked 
to good, let something therefore be said about this. Truth comes to be joined to good when a person finds joy in doing good to his neighbour for truth and goodness' own sake, and not for any selfish 
or worldly reason. When that affection moves a person the truths he hears or reads or thinks about become joined to good; and this can usually be seen in an affection for truth which has that end 
in view.  </p>

`Et congregavit omnem cibum septem annorum': quod significet conservationem veri bono adjuncti, multiplicati primis temporibus, constat ex significatione `congregare' quod hic sit conservare, nam `congregavit 
illum et dedit in urbibus et in medio', per quae significatur quod recondiderit in interioribus, ita quod conservaverit, cessit enim usui in annis famis; ex significatione `cibi' quod sit omne 
id quo internus homo nutritur; quod id sit bonum et verum, constare potest ex correspondentia cibi terrestris quo nutritur externus homo, cum cibo spirituali quo nutritur {1}internus; hic itaque est 
verum bono adjunctum, nam hoc est quod conservatur et reconditur in interioribus; per `septem annos' significantur primi status cum multiplicata vera, n. 5339; inde patet quod per `congregavit omnem 
cibum septem annorum' significetur conservatio veri bono adjuncti, multiplicati primis temporibus. [2] Dicitur conservatio veri bono adjuncti, sed quia pauci sciunt quid sit verum bono adjunctum, et 
minus quomodo et quando verum bono adjungitur, quapropter dicendum:  verum conjungitur bono quando homo jucundum percipit in benefaciendo proximo propter verum et bonum, non autem propter se {2}aut mundum; 
cum homo est in illa affectione, vera quae tunc audit, vel legit, vel cogitat, conjunguntur bono; quod etiam appercipi solet ab affectione veri propter illum finem. @1 infernus I$ @2 et $ </p>
