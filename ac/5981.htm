<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5981节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5981.</strong>地狱灵和魔鬼中间有时会出现可耻肮脏、令人作呕的景象；实际上，这些景象就是一个恶人所思想和谈论的那类东西。为避免这类景象把天使彻底赶走，在天使的感觉看来，它们比实际的样子要温和，不那么可怕。为叫我了解天使如何感觉这类事物，当可耻肮脏、令人作呕的景象出现时，我被赋予天使的感觉。这种感觉具有这样的性质，我一点也不害怕，因为我所看见的东西已经转变为不怎么可怕的东西。我无法描述它，只能把它比作一个尖角和刺点都已被除去的尖锐多刺的物体。地狱灵和魔鬼当中的可耻肮脏、令人作呕的事物以这种方式在天使当中被钝化。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5981</b></p><p><b>5981.</b>
There sometimes appears to view with infernal spirits and genii things shameful and filthy, and in fact such things as an evil man thinks and speaks. Lest on account of such things the angels should 
flee away altogether, these shameful and filthy things are perceived by them as being milder than they really are. In order that I might know how such things are perceived by the angels, when shameful 
things presented themselves there was given me the angelic perception, which was such that I felt no horror. The shameful things were turned into a mildness such as cannot be described, but can only 
be compared to things angular and pungent when the angularity and pungency are taken away from them. In this way the shameful and filthy things of infernal spirits and genii are dulled with the angels. </p>

Among hellish spirits and genii foul and disgusting sights sometimes occur, which are in effect the kinds of thoughts an evil person has and utters. In order that such sights may not drive the angels 
completely away, they are perceived by the angels as things less awful than they really are. To enable me to know how the angels perceived such things I was given angelic perception when foul sights 
appeared. It was such that I had no feeling at all of horror, for what I saw had been turned into something less awful. I cannot describe it, only compare it to a sharp-cornered and prickly object that 
has had the corners and points removed from it. This is the kind of way that foul and disgusting things among hellish spirits and genii are made much less so among angels. </p>

Apparent apud infernales spiritus et genios aliquoties turpia et foeda, et effective qualia homo malus cogitat et loquitur; ne angeli propter talia prorsus aufugiant, turpia illa et foeda (t)apud illos 
mitiora appercipiuntur quam in se sunt. Ut scirem quomodo talia ab angelis appercipiuntur, data est mihi apperceptio angelica cum turpia obvenirent, quae talis erat ut nihil horrescerem; versa {1}fuerunt 
in mite quale describi non potest sed modo comparari cum angulatis et pungentibus qualia sunt cum illis {2}ablata sunt angularia et punctoria: ita turpia et foeda spirituum et geniorum infernalium 
hebetantur apud angelos. @1 fuit$ @2 oblata I$ </p>
