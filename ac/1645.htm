<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1645.</strong>但天使的言语无法形容，远远胜过灵人的言语，因为它远在天使灵的言语之上。人只要活在肉身，就决无法理解。在灵人界，灵人们也不能对它形成任何概念，因为它超出了其思维的领悟能力。天使的这种言语并非由象灵人和天使灵所具有的观念所代表的那类事物组成，而是由目的及其衍生的功用组成，目的和功用是事物的初始和要素。天使的思维被轻柔地引入这些目的和功用中，并在那里经历无穷变化。这种言语的每一个部分都有一种内在和快乐的喜悦，是由来自主的相爱之善产生的，还有一种美丽悦人之物，是由来自那善的信之真理产生的。目的和来自目的的功用可以说是最微妙的接受器，是存在于超出理解范畴的属天、属灵形式中的悦人并具有无数变化的属灵实物。他们被主保持在这些目的和功用中，因为主的国是目的和功用的国。所以，与人同在的天使只关注他的目的和功用，并不从这个人的思维中引出别的东西。凡属思想和物质层面的其它事物，他们毫不关心，因为这些东西远在他们的范围之下。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1645.</strong> Angels' speech, however, defies description. It is far superior to the speech of spirits, since it surpasses that of angelic spirits, and is positively unintelligible to us in every way as long as we are living in the body. Spirits in the world of spirits cannot even form a notion of it for themselves, since it lies beyond the reach of their thoughts.<br />The speech of angels does not involve mental images representing the subject matter, as with spirits and angelic spirits. Instead, angels speak in terms of purpose and therefore of usefulness, which are the first and most important elements of any subject. Into these they weave their angelic thoughts, which take on endlessly new and different forms. A mutually loving goodness from the Lord touches each and every word with an inner delight and happiness, while the truth of a faith inspired by mutual love gives it beauty and tremendous appeal. Purpose and consequent use are like containers that are extraordinarily pliable, subject in the most pleasurable way to unending variation, manifested in heavenly and spiritual forms we cannot possibly comprehend. The Lord holds angels in these thoughts because his kingdom is exclusively a kingdom of purpose and usefulness.<br />As a result, the angels present with us pay no attention to anything but purpose and use, and they elicit nothing else from our thoughts. Nothing else matters to them 钬?whether it belongs to the mental or material world 钬?because it is far beneath their sphere of interest. </p>

But the speech of angels is ineffable, far above the speech of spirits, for it is above that of angelic spirits, and is not intelligible in any way to man so long as he lives in the body. Nor can the 
spirits in the world of spirits form any idea of it, for it is above the perceptive power of their thought. This speech of angels is not of things represented by any ideas like those of spirits and angelic 
spirits; but it is a speech of ends and of the derivative uses, which are the primaries and the essentials of things. Into these are angelic thoughts insinuated, and are varied there with indefinite 
variety; and in each and all things of that speech there is an inward and happy delight from the good of mutual love from the Lord, and a beautiful and delightful one from the truth of faith from 
that good. Ends, and the uses from them, are as it were most delicate recipients, and are the delightful subjects of unnumbered variations; and this by means of celestial and spiritual forms that are 
beyond comprehension. In these they are kept by the Lord, for the Lord's kingdom is simply a kingdom of ends and uses; and for this reason also the angels who are with a man attend to nothing else than 
the ends and uses, and elaborate nothing else from the man's thought. All other things, which are ideal and material, they care nothing for; because these are far below their sphere. </p>

But angels' speech is beyond description. Being superior to the speech of angelic spirits it is far superior to the speech of spirits, and cannot in any way be understood by man as long as he lives in 
the body Spirits in the world of spirits are unable to form any idea of it since it is above that which they are able to perceive in their thought. Angels' speech does not consist of things represented 
by means of any ideas like those which spirits and angelic spirits have, but consists of ends in view and of uses flowing from these, which are the first beginnings and the essentials of things. It 
is into these ends and uses that angelic thoughts are gently introduced, and there they undergo endless variation. And every single part of that speech has within it an interior and happy delight produced 
by the good of mutual love from the Lord, and that which is beautiful and delightful produced by the truth of faith originating in that good Ends in view and the uses arising from them are so to 
speak very delicate recipient vessels, and are delightful and ever-varying spiritual realities existing in celestial and spiritual forms beyond comprehension. In these they are kept by the Lord, for 
the Lord's kingdom is wholly a kingdom of ends and uses. For this reason also the angels present with a person pay no attention to anything other than his ends and uses, and elicit nothing else from 
the person's thought. All other things, which belong to mental and material levels, they do not care about since these are far beneath their own sphere. </p>

</p><b>1645.</b>
Loquela autem angelorum est ineffabilis, longe supra loquelam spirituum quia supra spirituum angelicorum, et nusquam homini aliqua modo intelligibilis quamdiu in corpore vivit; spiritus in mundo spirituum 
nec sibi ideam ejus sistere possunt, nam est supra eorum cogitationis perceptibilitatem: loquela illorum non est rerum repraesentatarum per aliquas ideas quales spirituum et spirituum angelicorum, 
sed est finium et inde usuum, qui sunt principalia et essentialia rerum; illis angelicae cogitationes insinuantur, et ibi variantur cum indefinita varietate; et in omnibus et singulis illius loquelae 
est jucundum interius et felix ex bono amoris mutui a Domino, ac pulchrum et delectabile a vero fidei inde; fines et inde usus sunt quasi recipientia lenissima, et subjecta deliciosa indefinitarum 
variationum, et hoc per formas incomprehensibiles caelestes et spirituales; in his tenentur a Domino, nam regnum Domini non est nisi finium et usuum: quare etiam angeli qui apud hominem, ad nihil aliud 
attendunt quam ad fines et usus, et nihil aliud ab hominis cogitatione elimant; cetera quae sunt idealia et materialia nihil curant quia haec sunt longe infra eorum sphaeram. </p>
