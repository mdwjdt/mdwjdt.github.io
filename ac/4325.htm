<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4325.</strong>总体上的感官活动或一般感官活动分为自主的和非自主的。自主的感官活动属于大脑，而非自主的感官活动属于小脑。总体感官活动的这两种形式在人里面被结合起来，然而它们却是不同而分离的。从大脑发出的纤维建立总体上自主的感官，而从小脑发出的纤维建立非自主的感官。来自这两个源头的纤维在名为延髓和脊髓的两个附件内联结起来，并通过这些进入身体，在那里使它的肢体、内脏和器官成形。包裹身体的部位，如肌肉和皮肤，以及感觉器官，绝大部分接受来自大脑的纤维；人通过这些而照着自己的意愿拥有感觉和活动。但包含在这些包裹物或覆盖物里面、被称为身体内脏的部位则接受来自小脑的纤维；因此人在这些部位中体验不到任何感觉，它们也不受其意愿的控制。由此在某种程度可知，何为总体上的感官活动，或一般自主的感官活动和一般非自主的感官活动。另外，要知道，总的整体必须先于任何个体部位而存在；没有总的整体，个体部位绝无可能存在和持续存在；事实上，它在总的整体里面持续存在；每一个体部位都受总的整体的性质和状态制约。这同样适用于人里面的感觉，以及活动。</p>

Sense in general, or general sense, is distinguished into voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary sense is proper to the cerebrum, but involuntary sense is proper to the cerebellum. In men these two kinds 
of general sense are conjoined, but yet are distinct. The fibers which flow forth from the cerebrum present the voluntary sense in general, and the fibers which flow from the cerebellum present the 
involuntary sense in general. The fibers of this double origin conjoin themselves together in the two appendices which are called the medulla oblongata and the medulla spinalis, and through these pass 
into the body, and shape its members, viscera, and organs. The parts which encompass the body, as the muscles and skin, and also the organs of the senses, for the most part receive fibers from the cerebrum; 
and hence man has sense and motion in accordance with his will. But the parts within this compass or enclosure, which are called the viscera of the body, receive fibers from the cerebellum; and 
consequently man has no sense of these parts, nor are they under the control of his will. From this it may in some measure appear what sense is in general, or the general voluntary sense, and the general 
involuntary sense. Be it known further that there must be a general in order that there may be any particular, and that the particular can in no wise come into existence and subsist without the 
general, and in fact that it subsists in the general; and that every particular is circumstanced according to the quality and according to the state of the general; and this is the case with sense in 
man, and also with motion. </p>

The activity of the senses in general, or general sensory activity, is divided into voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary sensory activity belongs properly to the cerebrum, but involuntary to the cerebellum. 
These two forms of general sensory activity are combined in the human being; yet they are distinct and separate. The fibres which issue from the cerebrum establish voluntary sensory activity in 
general, and the fibres which do so from the cerebellum establish involuntary. The fibres from these two sources combine together in the two appendages called the medulla oblongata and the medulla spinalis, 
and through these pass into the body and there shape its members, viscera, and organs. The parts which envelop the body, such as muscles and skin, and also the sensory organs, for the most part 
receive fibres from the cerebrum, and through these a person has sensory awareness and also movement controlled by his conscious will. But the parts which are contained within that outer envelopment 
or enclosure and which are called the viscera of the body receive fibres from the cerebellum, and therefore a person does not experience any feeling in these, and they are not subject to his conscious 
will. This shows something of what sensory activity in general is, that is, what general sensory activity is, both voluntary and involuntary. In addition it should be recognized that the general whole 
must exist first before any individual part can do so; that no individual part can possibly come into being and be kept in being without the general whole, and indeed that it is kept in being within 
this; and that every individual part is conditioned by the nature and state of the general whole. The same applies to sensory activity in the human being, and also to movements. </p>

Sensus in communi, seu sensus communis, distinguitur in voluntarium et in voluntarium; sensus voluntarius proprius est cerebro, sensus autem involuntarius proprius est cerebello; hi bini sensus communes 
conjuncti sunt apud hominem, sed usque distincti; </p>
<p>fibrae quae ex cerebro effluunt, sistunt in communi sensum voluntarium, et fibrae quae ex cerebello sistunt in communi sensum involuntarium; 
fibrae duplicis illius originis se conjungunt in binis appendicibus quae `medulla oblongata' et `medulla spinalis' vocantur, et per illas transeunt in corpus, et conformant ejus membra, viscera et 
organa; quae circumcingunt corpus, ut musculi et cutis, tum quoque organa sensuum {1} illa ad plurimam partem accipiunt fibras a cerebro; inde sensus homini et (o)inde motus secundum voluntatem ejus; 
at quae intra illam cincturam seu clausuram sunt {10} et viscera corporis vocantur, accipiunt fibras a cerebello {11}; inde homo illorum sensum non habet, nec sub voluntatis ejus arbitrio sunt: 
inde aliquatenus constare potest quid sensus in communi, seu sensus communis voluntarius et sensus communis involuntarius.  Praeterea sciendum quod commune erit ut sit aliquid particulare, et quod 
particulare nusquam existere et subsistere possit absque communi, et quidem quod subsistat in communi; et quod omne particulare se habeat secundum quale et secundum statum communis; ita quoque sensus 
apud hominem, (c)et ita quoque motus.      @1 sensus$      @2 ut viscera thoracis et abdominis, tum membra generationis$      @3 cerebelli$ </p>
