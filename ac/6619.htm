<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6619节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6619.</strong>人的思维观念含有无数细节，包含在它们里面、被保持在秩序中的这些细节来自更内在的事物；这一事实在我早晚背诵主祷文的时候也向我显明了。那时，我的思维观念总是向天堂敞开，无数概念涌进来，好叫我清楚看到，我从主祷文的内容所获得的思维观念被来自天堂的细节填满。我还能讲述所涌入的诸如无法用言语来表达的概念，以及我理解不了的概念。我只感觉到由它们所产生的总体情感；说来奇妙，所流入的事物每天都在变化。我由此得以知道，主祷文的内容所包含的事物，比整个天堂所能知道的还要多；人在主祷文里面发现的东西越多，他的思维就越向天堂敞开；另一方面，他发现得越少，他的思维就越关闭。因为思维关闭的人在主祷文中只能看见字义，或离这些话最近的那层含义。</p>

That there are countless things in the ideas of thought, and that those which are in order within them are there from things more interior, was also evident to me while I read the Lord's Prayer morning 
and evening. The ideas of my thought were then always opened toward heaven, and countless things flowed in, so that I observed clearly that the ideas of thought taken from the contents of the Prayer 
were filled from heaven. And such things were also poured in as cannot be uttered, and also could not be comprehended by me; I merely felt the general resulting affection, and wonderful to say the things 
that flowed in were varied from day to day. From this I was given to know that in the contents of this Prayer there are more things than the universal heaven is capable of comprehending; and that 
with man there are more things in it in proportion as his thought has been opened toward heaven; and on the other hand, there are fewer things in it in proportion as his thought has been closed; for 
with those whose thought has been closed, nothing more appears therein than the sense of the letter, or that sense which is nearest the words. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6619</b></p><p><b>6619.</b>
The fact that the ideas constituting a person's thought contain countless details, and that the details they contain are held in order from interior sources, has also been evident to me when morning 
and evening I have recited the Lord's Prayer. As often as I recited it the ideas constituting my thought were opened towards heaven and countless concepts flowed in. This happened so that I might discern 
clearly that the ideas belonging to my thought which I had gained from the contents of that Prayer were filled out with details from heaven. I was also able to tell that concepts poured in such as 
I cannot express in words, as well as ones that I was unable to understand. I did no more than feel the overall affection resulting from them. And what has been amazing, the things flowing in have varied 
every day. From all this I have been allowed to know that the contents of that Prayer hold more within them than the whole of heaven is capable of understanding; also that a person finds more in 
it, the more his thought is opened towards heaven, and conversely he finds less in it, the more his thought is closed. For with people whose thought is closed nothing more is seen in the Prayer than the 
literal meaning or that nearest the actual words. </p>

Quod innumerabilia insint ideis cogitationis, et quod illa quae insunt, ordine insint ab interioribus, patuit {1}etiam mihi, cum mane et vespere legi Orationem Domini; toties tunc ideae cogitationis 
meae aperiebantur versus caelum, et influebant innumera, sic ut animadverterem clare quod ideae {2}cogitationis ex (t)Orationis contentis captae, implerentur e caelo; ac talia quoque infunderentur, quae 
enuntiari nequeunt, et quoque quae {3}non a me comprehendi potuerunt, modo affectionem inde resultantem communem sensi; et quod mirum, illa quae influebant, quotidie variabantur; inde datum est scire 
quod in Orationis illius contentis {4} plura insint quam universum caelum capax {5}est comprehendere; et quod eo plura insint apud hominem, quo cogitatio ejus magis aperta est versus caelum; et vicissim 
quod eo pauciora quo cogitatio ejus magis clausa; apud (c)eos enim, quibus cogitatio clausa est, nihil plus inibi apparet quam sensus litterae seu proximus vocum. @1 quoque$ @2 cogitatione$ @3
