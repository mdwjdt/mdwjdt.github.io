<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10786</strong>.他们补充说，当这些人告诉他们说，他们要有信仰，要相信他们所说的一切话时，他们也感到困惑，于是便回答他们说，他们不知道什么叫有信仰，也不知道什么叫相信，因为他们凭直觉感知某件事是真的。事实上，他们属于主的属天国度，在那里，直觉使每个人都知道在我们这里被称为信之真理的真理；因为他们以一种不同于属于主的属灵国度之人的方式被主光照。我还被允许从他们观念所来自的火焰般的源头看出，他们具有这种性质。每当谈论真理时，属于主的属天国度的人只说“是，是”，或“不是，不是”。他们从不推理真理，推理它们是否是这样。他们正是主所说的那些人：<br />你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是从恶出来的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br />这解释了为何那些灵人说，他们不知道什么叫有信仰或什么叫相信。他们认为这就像是有人对一个亲眼看见房子或树木的同伴说，他要信仰或相信它们是房子或树木；而事实上，他能清楚看到事实就是这样。这就是那些属于主的属天国度之人的特征，这也是这些天使灵的特征。我们告诉他们说，我们地球上很少有人拥有内在的直觉，因为那里的人年幼的时候学习真理，却没有实践它们。人有两种官能，被称为理解力和意愿。有些人只让真理进入他们的记忆，不允许进一步地渗透，因而稍稍进入他们的理解力，却没有进入他们的生活，也就是进入他们意愿；他们是那种因无法从主那里获得任何光照或洞察力，所以才谈论必须相信的事，或叫人们必须有信仰的人。他们还推理这些事是不是真的，事实上以任何洞察力或理解力来感知它们。他们以这些方式谈论，是因为与他们同住的真理缺乏来自天堂的任何光；对那些离开天堂之光看事物的人来说，虚假能显为真理，真理能显为虚假。因此，我们地球上的许多人患有如此严重的失明症，以至于即便一个人没有实践真理，也就是照它们生活，他们仍声称，这个仅凭信就能得救。</p>

They said further that these persons also confuse them by telling them that they ought to have faith, and to believe all that they say; and that they reply to them that they do not know what faith is, 
or what it is to believe, seeing that they perceive within themselves that the thing is so. For they were of the Lord's celestial kingdom, where all know from interior perception the truths which with 
us are called truths of faith, because they are in enlightenment from the Lord, differently from those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. That they were of this nature it was also given to see 
from the flame-like source of their ideas. When there is discourse about truths, those who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom say no more than Yea, yea, or Nay, nay; and they never reason about them 
as to whether they are so or are not so. These are they of whom the Lord says, "Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; that which is more than these is from evil." From this it is that these 
spirits said that they do not know what it is to have faith, or to believe. They consider this to be like someone telling his companion, who sees houses or trees with his own eyes, that he ought to have 
faith or believe that they are houses and trees, while he clearly sees that such is the fact. Such are they who belong to the Lord's celestial kingdom, and such were these angelic spirits. We told 
them that there are few on our earth who have interior perception, for the reason that in their youth they learn truths and do not practice them. For man has two faculties, which are called the understanding 
and the will; and as those who do not admit truths further than into the memory and thus a little into the understanding, but not into the life, that is, into the will, cannot be in any enlightenment 
or in interior sight from the Lord, they say that things must be believed, or that people must have faith. And they also reason about these things as to whether they are true or not; nay, they 
do not wish them to be perceived by any interior sight or understanding. They speak in this way because with them truths are devoid of light from heaven, and to those who see without light from heaven, 
falsities can appear as truths, and truths as falsities. From this a blindness so great has taken possession of many there, that although a man does not practice truths, that is, live according to 
them, they nevertheless say that he can be saved by faith alone. </p>

They added that they also become confused when any such person tells them that they ought to have faith in and to believe the things he tells them, and that in answer to him they say that they do not 
know what faith is or what believing is, since they perceive intuitively that something is true. For they belonged to the Lord's celestial kingdom, where intuitive perception gives everyone a knowledge 
of those truths which with us are called matters of faith; for they are enlightened by the Lord, in a different way from those who belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. I was also allowed to see 
that their nature was such from the fiery source from which they received their ideas. Whenever there is talk about truths those who belong to the Lord's celestial kingdom say no more than 'Yes, yes' 
or 'No, no'. They never reason about truths, whether they are such or not. These are the ones about whom the Lord says,  </p>
<p>Your words shall be Yes, yes; No, no; anything beyond this is from evil<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:37</a>.]  </p>
<p>This explains why those spirits said that they did not know what having faith or believing was. They consider this to be like someone saying to a companion who sees houses or trees with 
his own eyes that he ought to have faith or believe that they are houses or trees, when he can see clearly that that is what they are. Such is the character of those who belong to the Lord's celestial 
kingdom, and such was the character of those angelic spirits. We told them that there are few on our planet who possess intuitive perception, because people there learn truths when they are young but 
do not practise them. For a person has two powers of mind, called the understanding and the will. Some do not let truths penetrate any further than their memory and slightly beyond into their understanding, 
but not into their life, that is, into their will; and they are ones who, because they cannot receive any enlightenment or insight from the Lord, talk of the need for things to be believed or 
for people to have faith. They also reason about whether such things are true or not, having no wish indeed to perceive them with any insight or power of understanding. They talk in those ways because 
the truths that reside with them lack any light from heaven, and to those who see things without light from heaven falsities can appear as truths, and truths as falsities. Consequently very many on 
our planet have become afflicted with a blindness so great that even though a person does not practise truths, that is, lead a life in keeping with them, they nevertheless say that he can be saved by 
faith alone.

Porro aiebant quod etiam confundant illos per id quod dicant se oportere fidem habere ac credere quae dicunt, {1}et quod respondeant illis quod non sciant quid fides, seu quid sit credere, cum in se 
{2}percipiunt quod ita sit; erant enim ex regno caelesti Domini, ubi omnes ex interiore perceptione sciunt vera quae apud nos vocantur fidei, sunt enim in illustratione a Domino, secus ac illi qui in 
regno Domini spirituali sunt; quod illi tales essent, videre etiam dabatur {3}ex flammeo ex quo ideae eorum; qui e regno caelesti Domini sunt, illi cum sermo est de veris, non plus {4}dicunt quam ita, 
ita, vel Non, non, et nusquam ratiocinantur de illis num ita sit vel non ita sit; illi sunt de quibus Dominus dicit, 	Sermo vester erit, Ita, ita, Non, non; quod ultra est ex malo est (Matth. v 37); 
inde est quod spiritus illi dixerint quod non sciant quid sit fidem habere seu credere; considerant hoc sicut si aliquis diceret {5}ad socium qui oculis suis {6}videt domos aut arbores, quod fidem habere 
{7}debeat seu credere quod sint domus {8}ac arbores, cum clare {9}videt quod ita sit; tales sunt qui e regno caelesti Domini sunt, et tales erant hi spiritus angelici.  Dicebamus illis quod {10}pauci 
in nostra tellure sint qui interiorem perceptionem habent, ex causa quia in juventute sua discunt vera et non faciunt illa; sunt enim binae facultates homini, quae vocantur intellectus et voluntas; 
qui non ultra quam in memoriam et inde aliquantum in intellectum admittunt vera, et non in vitam, hoc est, in voluntatem, illi quia in nulla illustratione aut in interiore visu a Domino possunt esse, 
dicunt quod credenda sint seu quod fides habenda, et quoque ratiocinantur de illis num vera sint vel non, immo {11}nec volunt {12}ut percipiantur aliquo visu interiore seu intellectu; ita dicunt quia 
vera apud illos sunt absque luce e caelo, et illis qui absque luce e caelo vident, falsa possunt apparere ut vera, ac vera ut falsa; inde plures ibi tanta occupavit {13} caecitas {12}ut tametsi homo 
non faciat vera seu vivat secundum illa, usque dicant eum per solam fidem posse salvari @1 ad quod respondent$ @2 percipiant$ @3 ex ideis eorum, quae apparebant sicut flammeo colore; illi enim tales
