<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6877节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6877.</strong>“他们若问我说，祂的名字是什么”表祂的品质是什么？这从“名字”的含义清楚可知，“名字”是指品质（参看<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>节）。摩西的这个问题表明了雅各的后代是何性质或品质，也就是说，他们不仅忘了“耶和华”这个名，还承认多神，其中一个比另一个更大；这就是为何他们想知道神的名；他们还以为只承认神的名就足够了。雅各的后代之所以具有这种性质或品质，是因为他们仅处于没有内在的外在；不了解内在的人对于神，不可能有其它信仰，因为他们不能接受从天堂来的任何光，以光照他们的内层。因此，为叫他们能承认耶和华，他们被告知，他们祖宗的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，向摩西显现，并且祂差遣了摩西。这样他们就被引导出于对他们祖宗的盲目崇敬而非任何内在的觉知承认耶和华。对那百姓来说，仅以名字来敬拜耶和华就足够了，因为除了教会的外在之外，他们不能接受任何事物，因而只能接受代表其内在之物。此外，外在建立在他们中间，也是为了所代表的东西能以内在形式呈现在天上，因而天堂仍能以某种方式与人类联结。</p>

And they say to me, What is His name? That this signifies His quality, is evident from the signification of "name," as being quality (see n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 2628, 2724, 3006, 6674). From this question 
of Moses appears the quality of the posterity of Jacob, namely, that they had not only forgotten the name "Jehovah," but also that they acknowledged a number of gods, one of which was greater than 
another; hence it was that they would desire to know His name; they believed also that it was sufficient to acknowledge God as to name. That the posterity of Jacob were such was because they were only 
in externals without internals; and they who are without internals cannot think otherwise about God, because they cannot receive anything of light from heaven to enlighten their interiors. In order 
therefore that they might acknowledge Jehovah, it was said to them that the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, had been seen, and that He sent; thus they 
were induced to acknowledge Jehovah from a blind veneration for their fathers, but not from any internal perception. It was also sufficient for that people to worship Jehovah merely as to name, because 
they could not receive anything but the external of a church, thus that which only represented its internal; the external was instituted among them also in order that what was represented thereby might 
be presented in heaven in the internal form, and thus that there might still be some conjunction of heaven with man. </p>

'And they may say to me, What is His name?' means, What is His essential nature? This is clear from the meaning of 'name' as essential nature, dealt with in <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>. 
This question asked by Moses shows what the descendants of Jacob were like. It shows that not only had they forgotten the name Jehovah, but also that they acknowledged a number of gods, one of whom was 
greater than another; and that was why they wished to know that god's name. They also believed that it was enough if merely God's name was acknowledged. The reason why the descendants of Jacob were 
like this was that they were acquainted only with the outward aspects of things, not with their inner aspects; and people unacquainted with those inner aspects cannot have any other kind of belief with 
regard to God since they are unable to receive any light from heaven which would shine on more internal levels of their minds. To the end therefore that they might acknowledge Jehovah they were told 
that the God of their fathers - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob - had appeared to Moses, and that He had sent him. Thus what led them to acknowledge Jehovah was blind veneration 
of their forefathers, not any inner perception. For that people it was enough if they did worship Jehovah merely in name, for the further reason that they were unable to accept anything other than 
the outer aspect of the Church, thus solely that which was to represent the inner aspect of it. That outer aspect, furthermore, was established among them to the end that the inward form of what they 
were to represent might be displayed in heaven; then in some kind of way heaven would still be joined to mankind. </p>

`Et dicant mihi, Quodnam nomen Illius?`: quod significet quale Illius, constat ex significatione `nominis' quod sit quale, de qua n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 2628, 2724, 3006, 6674.  Ex {1}hoc quod Moscheh 
interrogavit, apparet qualis fuit posteritas (c)ex Jacobo, quod nempe non solum obliti fuerint nominis Jehovae, sed etiam quod plures deos agnoverint, quorum unus major esset altero; inde erat quod scire 
vellent nomen illius; credebant etiam quod satis esset agnoscere Deum quoad nomen; causa quod posteri Jacobi tales essent, erat quia solum in externis absque internis erant; et qui absque internis 
sunt, illi non aliter de Deo opinari possunt, {2}quia nihil lucis e caelo quae interiora {3} (d)illorum illustret (t)recipere possunt.  Ut itaque Jehovam agnoscerent, dictum illis est quod Deus patrum 
illorum, Deus Abrahami, Deus Jischaki, et Deus Jacobi, visus esset, et quod Ille {4}miserit; ita inducebantur ad agnoscendum Jehovam {5} ex (t)caeca veneratione {6} pro patribus {7}suis, non autem 
{8} ex perceptione {9}aliqua interna.  Satis etiam illi populo erat Jehovam modo quoad nomen colere quia non potuerunt aliud recipere quam externum Ecclesiae, ita id (t)quod solum repraesentaret internum 
ejus; {6} hoc quoque apud illos institutum fuit ex causa ut quod repraesentarent sisteretur in caelo in forma interna; et sic aliqua usque conjunctio esset caeli cum homine. 	@1 his, quae$ 	@2 quoniam$ 	@3
