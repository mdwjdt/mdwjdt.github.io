<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5276节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5276.</strong>“埃及全地大丰收”表在属世层的这两部分中真理的增多。这从“丰收”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：“丰收”是指真理的增多，如下文所述；“埃及地”是指属世层的这两个部分。因为“埃及”表示记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>-<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）；这地因表示记忆知识，故也表示属世层，因为存储在属世层里面的东西就被称为记忆知识；所以“埃及地”表示记忆知识存储于其中的属世心智。正因如此，“埃及全地”表示属世层的这两个部分，即内层属世层和外层属世层（属世层既有内层，也有外层，参看<a href="5118.htm">5118</a>，<a href="5126.htm">5126</a>节）。“丰收”之所以表示真理的增多，是因为这个词与饥荒形成对比，描述了饥荒的反面，而“饥荒”表示真理的缺乏。在原文，用来表达丰收的这个词就是表达饥荒的反面，在内义上表示宗教知识的丰富和充分的词；因为“饥荒”表示这些知识的缺乏。宗教知识无非是属世人的真理，只是这些真理尚未变成他自己的；此处所表示的就是这类真理的增多。宗教知识不会变成人里面的真理，除非它们通过理解而得到承认，当他坚定地信奉它们时，这种情形就会发生；而这些真理不会变成他自己的，除非他照之生活。事实上，若非变成他生活的一部分，没有什么东西能变成人自己的；因此，由于这些真理形成他的生活，所以他自己就在真理中。</p>

Of great abundance of produce in all the land of Egypt. That this signifies the multiplication of truth in both naturals, is evident from the signification of "abundance of produce," as being the multiplication 
of truth (of which presently); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being both naturals. For by "Egypt" is signified memory-knowledge (see n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 
4964, 4966); and as memory-knowledge is signified, so too is the natural, for the reason that what is in the natural is called memory-knowledge; and therefore the "land of Egypt" is the natural mind in 
which is memory-knowledge. Hence by "all the land of Egypt" is signified both the interior and the exterior natural (that the natural is both interior and exterior may be seen above, n. 5118, 5126). 
That "abundance of produce" signifies a multiplication of truth, is because it is contrasted with famine, which signifies a lack of truth. The term by which "abundance of produce" is expressed in the 
original tongue is one that expresses the opposite of famine, and in the internal sense signifies a full store and sufficiency of knowledges, because "famine" signifies a lack of them. Knowledges are 
nothing else than the truths of the natural man, but which have not yet been made his own; the multiplication of such truths is here meant. Knowledges do not become truths in man until they are acknowledged 
by the understanding, which takes place when they are confirmed by him; and these truths do not become his own until he lives according to them; for nothing is made man's own except that which 
becomes of his life, for thus he himself is in the truths, because his life is in them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5276</b></p><p><b>5276.</b>
'A great abundance of corn in all the land of Egypt' means the multiplication of truth in both parts of the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'an abundance of corn' as a multiplication of truth, 
dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as both parts of the natural. For knowledge is meant by 'Egypt', see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>; and since knowledge is 
meant by that land, so also is the natural meant by it, for the reason that as the expression 'factual knowledge' is used to describe what is stored in the natural, 'the land of Egypt' therefore means 
the natural mind in which factual knowledge is stored. This being so, 'all the land of Egypt' means both parts of the natural - the interior natural and the exterior natural, regarding which, see <a href="5118.htm">5118</a>, <a href="5126.htm">5126</a>. The reason 'an abundance of corn' means a multiplication of truth is that the expression describes the opposite of 'famine', by which an absence of truth is meant. The word used in the original 
language to express an abundance of corn - an antonym to 'famine' - means in the internal sense a vast wealth and sufficiency of religious knowledge; for 'famine' means an absence of it. Religious 
knowledge consists in nothing else than the truths present in a person's natural man which have not yet been made his own by him. The multiplication of such truths is what is meant here. Religious knowledge 
does not come to be truths residing with a person until that knowledge finds acceptance in his understanding, which happens when he firmly embraces it; and what are then truths residing with him 
are not made his own until he lives in conformity with them. For nothing is made a person's own other than that which is made part of his life; thus because those truths form his life, his true self 
is invested in them. </p>

</p><b>5276.</b>
`Abundantia annonae magna in omni terra Aegypti': quod significet multiplicationem veri in utroque naturali, constat ex significatione `abundantiae annonae' quod sit multiplicatio veri, de qua sequitur; 
et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit utrumque naturale, per `Aegyptum' enim significatur scientia, videatur n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966, et quia scientia, etiam significatur 
naturale, ex causa quia scientificum dicitur id quod in naturali, est itaque `terra Aegypti' mens naturalis in qua scientificum; inde per 'omnem terram Aegypti' significatur utrumque naturale, nempe 
interius et exterius; quod naturale interius et exterius sit, videatur n. 5118, 5126. Quod `abundantia annonae' significet multiplicationem veri, est quia opponitur `fami' quae significat defectum 
veri; vox per quam in lingua originali exprimitur `abundantia annonae', est cui opponitur `fames', et significat in sensu interno plenam copiam et sufficientiam cognitionum, quia `fames' defectum (e)earum. 
Cognitiones non aliud sunt quam vera naturalis hominis, sed quae nondum ei appropriata sunt; talium verorum multiplicatio hic intelligitur; cognitiones non fiunt vera apud hominem priusquam agnoscuntur 
intellectu, quod fit cum ab ipso confirmantur; et haec vera non appropriantur ei priusquam is vivit secundum illa; nihil enim appropriatur homini quam quod fit vitae, sic enim ipse, quia vita 
ejus, illis inest. </p>
