<h4 align="center"></h4><p>内义<br /><strong>10395</strong>.出埃及记32:1-6.百姓见摩西迟延不下山，百姓就聚集到亚伦那里，对他说，起来！为我们造神明，可以走在我们前头；因为这个摩西，就是领我们从埃及地上来的那人，我们不知道他遭了什么事。亚伦对他们说，你们去摘下你们妻子、儿女耳上的金耳环，拿来给我。众百姓就都摘下他们耳上的金耳环，拿来给亚伦。亚伦从他们手里接过来，用凿子塑造它，把它铸成一只牛犊；他们就说，以色列啊，这些是你们的神明，是领你们从埃及地上来的。亚伦看见，就在它面前筑坛，且亚伦宣告说，明日是耶和华（注：jehovah，首字母是小写）的节日。次日清早，他们起来献燔祭，带平安祭；百姓就坐下吃喝，起来玩耍。<br />“百姓见摩西迟延不下山”表以色列民族，那时他们没有在圣言中辨别出来自天堂的任何事物。“百姓就聚集到亚伦那里”表他们转向圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，与内在之物分离。“对他说”表劝告。“起来！为我们造神明，可以走在我们前头”表制造教义和敬拜的虚假，因而制造偶像崇拜的东西。“因为这个摩西，就是领我们从埃及地上来的那人，我们不知道他遭了什么事”表完全不知道圣言中还存在什么其它神性真理，这真理将一个人从一个外在层面提升到一个内在层面，并使他成为一个教会或教会的一个化身。“亚伦对他们说”表圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，没有内在之物。“你们去摘下你们妻子、儿女耳上的金耳环”表从圣言的字义中提取出诸如支持外在的爱和由这些爱所产生的主要观念或原则的那类事物。“拿来给我”表汇聚成一个整体。“众百姓就都摘下他们耳上的金耳环，拿来给亚伦”表实施。“亚伦从他们手里接过来”表支持他们自我的事物。“用凿子塑造它”表他们自己的聪明的一个产物。“把它铸成一只牛犊”表照着这个民族的爱之快乐。“他们就说，以色列啊，这些是你们的神明”表它要在一切事物之上受到敬拜。“是领你们从埃及地上来的”表引领他们的。“亚伦看见”表赞成。“就在它面前筑坛”表敬拜。“且亚伦宣告说，明日是耶和华（注：jehovah，首字母是小写）的节日”表这是值得庆祝的教会真正重要的事，是要不断受到敬拜的真正神性实在。“次日清早，他们起来”表被他们自己的爱激起。“献燔祭，带平安祭”表由他们自己的爱，因而这些爱的快乐和由此产生的虚假所献上的敬拜。“百姓就坐下吃喝”表将这些事物变成他们自己的。“起来玩耍”表由此产生的他们的内层庆祝的渴望，以及同意。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-6. And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain; and the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Rise, make us gods which 
shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that made us come up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him. And Aaron said unto them, Tear off the golden earrings which 
are in the ears of your women, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. And all the people tore off the golden earrings that were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. And he 
received them from their hand, and formed it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which made thee come up out of the land of Egypt. And Aaron saw, 
and built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, Tomorrow is a feast to jehovah.* And they rose up in the morning on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought-peace offerings; 
and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. "And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain" signifies the Israelitish nation when it did not notice 
in the Word anything from heaven; "and the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron" signifies that they turned themselves to the externals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, separate 
from what is internal; "and said unto him" signifies exhortation; "Rise, make us gods which shall go before us" signifies falsities of doctrine and of worship, thus things idolatrous; "for as for this 
Moses, the man that made us come up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him" signifies that it is altogether unknown what other Divine truth there is in the Word, which raises 
man from what is external into what is internal; "and Aaron said unto them" signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, without what is internal; "Tear off the golden earrings 
that are in the ears of your women, of your sons, and of your daughters" signifies the drawing out from the sense of the letter of the Word of such things as favor external loves and the principles thence 
derived; "and bring them unto me" signifies a bringing together into a one; "and all the people tore off the golden earrings that were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron" signifies the effect; 
"and he received them from their hand" signifies things that favor what is their own; "and formed it with a graving tool" signifies from their own intelligence; "and made it a molten calf" signifies 
according to the delight of the loves of that nation; "and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel" signifies which is to be worshiped above all things; "which made thee come up out of the land of 
Egypt" signifies which had led them; "and Aaron saw" signifies approval; "and he built an altar before it" signifies worship; "and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to jehovah*" 
signifies that this is a very essential of the church which is to be celebrated, and a very divine* which is to be perpetually adored; "and they rose up in the morning on the morrow" signifies incitement 
by their loves; "and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings" signifies the worship of their loves, thus of the delights of these loves, and of the falsities thence derived; "and the 
people sat down to eat and to drink" signifies the appropriation of these things; "and rose up to play" signifies the consequent festivity of their interiors, and consent. * The name "jehovah" is in 
this connection given by Swedenborg with a small initial letter, doubtless because as applied to the golden calf the name is profane and unworthy of veneration. The same remark applies to "divine" as 
here used, for contrary to his usual custom Swedenborg here writes this word with a small initial letter. See also n. 10566, 10603. [REVISER.] </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE  </p>
<p>Verses 1-6 And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain. And the people gathered together to Aaron, and said to him, Rise, make us gods to go before us; 
for this Moses, that man who caused us to come up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him. And Aaron said to them, Pull away the ear-jewels of gold which are on the ears of your 
wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me. And all the people pulled away the ear-jewels of gold which were on their ears, and brought them to Aaron. And he received [the gold] 
from their hands, and fashioned it with a chisel, and made out of it a calf of molded [metal]; and they said, These are your gods, O Israel, who caused you to come up out of the land of Egypt. And 
Aaron saw it and built an altar in front of it, and Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow there will be a feast to Jehovah<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. And they rose up in the morning of the next day, and offered burnt 
offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. </p>
<p>'And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain' means the Israelite nation, 
when they did not discern in the Word anything from heaven. 'And the people gathered together to Aaron' means that they directed themselves to the outward features of the Word, the Church, and worship, 
detached from what was inward. 'And said to him' means exhortation. 'Rise, make us gods to go before us' means producing falsities that figure in religious teachings and worship, thus producing 
things of an idolatrous nature. 'For this Moses, that man who caused us to come up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him' means a total unawareness of what other Divine Truth 
exists in the Word that raises a person from an external to an internal level [and makes him an embodiment of the Church]. 'And Aaron said to them' means the outward features of the Word, the Church, 
and worship, devoid of the inward. 'Pull away the ear-jewels of gold from the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters' means drawing out of the literal sense of the Word such things 
as are favourable to external forms of love and to the major ideas resulting from these. 'And bring them to me' means bringing together into a single whole. 'And all the people pulled away the ear-jewels 
of gold which were on their ears, and brought them to Aaron' means putting into effect. 'And he received [the gold] from their hands' means things favouring their proprium or self. 'And fashioned 
it with a chisel' means a product of their own intelligence. 'And made out of it a calf of molded [metal]' means in keeping with the delight belonging to that nation's loves. 'And they said, These are 
your gods, O Israel' means that it was to be worshipped above all things. 'Who caused you to come up out of the land of Egypt' means which led them. 'And Aaron saw it' means approval. 'And built an altar 
in front of it' means worship. 'And Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow there will be a feast to Jehovah' means that this is the really essential thing of the Church which is to be celebrated 
and the truly Divine reality that is to be worshipped unceasingly. 'And they rose up in the morning of the next day' means arousal by the loves that are their own. 'And offered burnt offerings, 
and brought peace offerings' means the worship offered by their own loves, and so by the delights belonging to those loves and by resulting falsities. 'And the people sat down to eat and drink' means 
making those things their own. 'And rose up to play' means the resulting desire of their interiors to celebrate, and concord.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-6. Et videbat populus quod tardaret Moscheh descendere de monte; et congregatus est populus ad Aharonem, et dicebant ad illum, Surge, fac nobis deos, qui eant ante nos, quia 
hic Moscheh ille vir qui ascendere fecit nos e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit illi. Et dixit ad illos Aharon, Avellite inaures auri quae in auribus mulierum vestrarum, filiorum vestrorum, et filiarum 
vestrarum, et adferte ad me. Et avulserunt omnis populus inaures auri quae in auribus eorum, et attulerunt ad Aharonem. Et accepit e manu eorum, et formavit illud caelo, et fecit illud vitulum 
fusilis; et dixerunt, Hi dii tui, Israel, qui ascendere fecerunt te e terra Aegypti. Et videbat Aharon, et aedificabat altare coram eo, et proclamabat Aharon, et dicebat, Festum jehovae cras. Et surgebant 
mane postridie, et offerebant holocausta, et adducebant pacifica, et sedebat populus ad edendum et bibendum, et surgebant ad ludendum. `Et videbat populus quod tardaret Moscheh descendere de monte' 
significat gentem Israeliticam cum non in Verbo apperciperet aliquid e caelo: `et congregatus est populus ad Aharonem' significat quod se contulerit ad externa Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus separata 
ab interno: `et dicebant ad illum' significat exhortationem: `Surge, fac nobis deos, qui eant ante nos' significat falsa doctrinae ac cultus, ita idololatrica: `quia hic Moscheh ille vir qui ascendere 
fecit nos e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit illi' significat quod prorsus ignotum sit quid Divinum Verum in Verbo aliud, quod elevat hominem ab externo in internum [, et facit Ecclesiam]: `et dixit 
ad illos Aharon' significat externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, absque interno: `Avellite inaures auri ex auribus mulierum vestrarum, filiorum vestrorum, et filiarum vestrarum' significat extractionem 
talium ex sensu litterae Verbi quae favent amoribus externis ac principiis inde: `et adferte mihi' significat collationem in unum: `et avulserunt omnis populus inaures auri quae in auribus illorum, 
et attulerunt ad Aharonem' significat effectum: `et accepit e manu eorum' significat faventia proprio eorum: `et formavit illud caelo' significat ex propria intelligentia: `et fecit illud vitulum fusilis' 
significat secundum jucundum amorum illius gentis: `et dixerunt, Hi dii tui, Israel' significat quod colendum supra omnia: `qui ascendere fecerunt te e terra Aegypti' significat quae duxerunt: 
`et videbat Aharon' significat approbationem: `et aedificabat altare coram eo' significat cultum: `et proclamabat Aharon, et dicebat, Festum jehovae cras' significat quod hoc sit ipsum Ecclesiae quod 
celebrandum, ac ipsum Divinum quod adorandum perpetuo: `et surgebant mane postridie' significat excitationem ab amoribus suis: `et offerebant holocausta, et adducebant pacifica' significat cultum suorum 
amorum, ita jucundorum eorum et inde falsorum: `et sedebat populus ad edendum et bibendum' significat appropriationem eorum: `et surgebant ad ludendum' significat festivitatem interiorum suorum inde, 
et consensum. </p>
