<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第10章  关于被称作人或亚当的上古教会</h4><br />1114.天使，灵人或离世后的人若蒙主许可，就能与他们想见的任何人会面，无论是在世时所认识的人，还是听说过的人。他们能当下见到这些人，与其交谈。奇妙的是，这些人顷刻之间就来到他们身边，而且非常亲密。因此，他们不但可以与通常彼此寻找的朋友交谈，还可以与他们所钦佩和仰慕的其他人交谈。蒙主的神圣恩典，我不仅得以与我在世间所认识的人对话，还得以与圣言中所提及的最有名的人物对话。所以，我既可以与某些属上古教会，就是称作人或亚当的那个教会的人对话，也可以与某些属后续教会的人对话，以便我可以知道，创世记头几章中的人名仅用来表教会，还使我能认识那个时代教会成员的秉性。因此，接下来叙述的是我所了解到的有关上古教会的情况。</p>

They can see such people in person and talk with them, and what is amazing, the person desired appears instantly, face to face. So it is possible to converse not only with friends (and friends usually find each other) but also with other people one had admired and revered.<br />The Lord in his divine mercy has given me the opportunity to talk not only to people I knew when they were alive in the body but also with leading figures in the Word; likewise with people from the earliest church — the one called Humankind, or Adam — and with some adherents of later churches too. The purpose was to show me that the personal names in the early chapters of Genesis only mean different religions and to teach me what people in the churches of that era were like.<br />The things I learned about the earliest churches, then, are the following. </p>

CHAPTER 10. CONCERNING THE MOST ANCIENT CHURCH, WHICH WAS CALLED MAN, OR ADAM Angels and spirits, or men after death, when permitted by the Lord, can meet all whom they have known in this world, or 
whom they have heard of-whomsoever they desire-can see them as present, and can converse with them. Wonderful to say, they are at hand in a moment and are most intimately present; so that it is possible 
to converse not only with friends, who usually find one another, but also with others that have been respected and esteemed. By the Divine mercy of the Lord it has been granted me to converse not 
only with those whom I had known when they lived in the body, but also with those of especial note in the Word; also with those who were of the Most Ancient Church, which was that called "Man," or "Adam," 
and with some who were of the subsequent churches, in order that I might know that by the names in the first chapters of Genesis churches are meant; and also that I might know what was the character 
of the men of the churches of that time. The accounts therefore that follow are what it has been given me to know about the Most Ancient Churches. </p>

<p>THE MOST ANCIENT CHURCH, WHICH WAS CALLED MAN, OR ADAM </p>
<p>Angels and spirits, that is, human beings after death, are able to meet any they like of all those 
whom they have been acquainted with in the world or whom they have heard of. They see them and talk to them in person, when the Lord allows it. And what is remarkable, those people are with them in 
an instant and very much in person. Thus they are allowed to speak not only to friends, who normally find one another, but also to others whom they have admired and revered. In the Lord's Divine mercy 
I have been allowed to speak not only to those who were known to me during their lifetime but also to the most prominent characters mentioned in the Word. Thus I have been allowed to speak as well to 
those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church, the Church called Man, or Adam, and also to certain of those who belonged to the Churches that came after it The reason for my being allowed to do so was 
so that I might know that the names found in the initial chapters of Genesis are used solely to mean Churches, and also that I might know the character of the members of the Churches of that time. 
The things that follow next therefore are what I have been given to know concerning the Most Ancient Churches. </p>

GENESEOS CAPUT DECIMUM </p>
<p>De Ecclesia Antiquissima; quae appellata Homo seu Adam </p>
<p>Angeli et spiritus, seu homines post mortem, omnes quos cognoverunt in mundo et de quibus audiverunt, quoscumque 
desiderant, possunt offendere, eos ut praesentes videre et cum iis loqui, cum Dominus id concedit; et quod mirum, momento adsunt et praesentissime; ita loqui licet non solum cum amicis, qui utplurimum 
se inveniunt, sed etiam cum aliis quos aestimarunt et coluerunt.  Ex Divina Domini Misericordia concessum fuit mihi, loqui non solum cum illis quos notus habui cum in corpore vixerunt, sed etiam cum 
illis qui in Verbo prae aliis famigerati sunt; ita quoque cum illis qui fuerunt ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae fuit illa quae appellatur Homo seu Adam; etiam cum quibusdam qui fuerunt ab Ecclesiis post 
illam, ex causa ut scirem quod per nomina in primis capitibus Geneseos modo Ecclesiae intellectae sint, tum ut scirem quales homines Ecclesiarum illius temporis fuerunt:  quae itaque scire datum de 
Antiquissimis Ecclesiis, sunt haec quae sequuntur. </p>
