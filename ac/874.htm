<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第874节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>874.</strong>本节描述了该教会成员在重生期间经历试探后的第一状态，这种状态对所有正在重生之人来说是很常见的，也就是说，他们以为凭自己行善思真。因为他们依然处于巨大的朦胧之中，主允许他们坚持这种观念。不过，只要他们执着于这种虚假的观念，他们所做的善行，或所思的真理就不是信之良善或真理。人凭自己所造作的任何东西都不可能是善的，因为它出于自我，即出于不纯、最不洁净的源头。良善绝不可能从那不纯和最不洁净的源头发出，因为这个人总是思及自己的功与义。有的甚至走得更远，藐视别人，如主在路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.9.htm">18:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.14.htm">14</a>）中所教导的，有的以其它方式犯错。人的私欲就这样混和，以致外面看上去是好的，而里面却是污秽。因此，人在这种状态下所行的良善并非信之良善。这同样适用于他所思的真理，因为虽然他所思想的东西可能非常正确，但只要自我中心是它的源头，尽管它本身是信之真理，他里面也不会有信之良善。为了成为信之真理，所有真理必须通过主包含信之良善。只有这时它们才能成为良善和真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]874.</strong> This scene depicts the first stage of regeneration following trial for the people of this church, a stage common to everyone who is being reborn: we imagine that we are doing good deeds and thinking true thoughts under our own power. Because we still cannot see clearly at all, the Lord lets us think this way.<br />Still, none of the good we do and none of the truth we contemplate while holding this opinion (a mistaken one) is the kind of goodness or truth that makes a part of faith. Nothing that we produce from ourselves can be good, because it is from ourselves — an impure and very unclean source. From an impure and unclean source nothing good can spring, because we are always thinking about how deserving and righteous we are. Some people, as the Lord teaches in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_874/bible_king-james-version_luke_18_9-14" target=_top>Luke 18:9-14</a>, go further and despise others in comparison with themselves. Others do other things just as bad. Self-centered desires add themselves to the mixture, making the exterior look good, although the interior is filthy.<br />As a consequence, the good that we do at this stage is not the good that belongs to faith. It is the same with the truth that we think. Even if the idea we adopt is absolutely true and is in itself a valid religious concept, nonetheless as long as we adopt it for selfish reasons, it has no religious good within it. Any truth, in order to be theologically true, has to have the good of faith from the Lord within it. That is when it first becomes good and true. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 874</b></p><p><b>874.</b>
Here is described the first state of the regeneration of the man of this church after temptation, which state is common to all who are being regenerated, namely, that they suppose they do what is good 
and think what is true from themselves; and because they are as yet in great obscurity, the Lord also leaves them so to imagine. But still all the good they do and all the truth they think while in 
such imagination, is not the good and truth of faith. For whatever man produces of himself cannot be good, because it is from himself, that is, from a fountain which is impure and most unclean. From this 
impure and unclean fountain no good can ever go forth, for the man is always thinking of his own merit and righteousness; and some go so far as to despise others in comparison with themselves (as 
the Lord teaches in Luke 18:9-14), and others err in other ways. Man's own cupidities intermingle themselves, so that while it appears outwardly to be good, it is inwardly filthy. For this reason the 
good which man does in this state is not the good of faith, and the case is the same with the truth that he thinks, for although that which he thinks may be very true, yet so long as it is from what is 
his own it is indeed in itself the truth of faith, but the good of faith is not in it; and all truth, in order to be the truth of faith, must have in it from the Lord the good of faith. Then for the 
first time there are good and truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 874</b></p><p><b>874.</b>
This describes the first state following temptation in the regeneration of the member of this Church, a state common to all who are being regenerated. It is a state when people imagine that they themselves 
are the source of the good they do and of the truth they think. And because they are still in the greatest obscurity, the Lord lets them cling to that opinion. But as long as they cling to that 
opinion which is false, no good deed they do nor any truth they think is the good or truth of faith. For whatever a person carries out from himself cannot be good since it has come from self, an impure 
and most unclean origin. From that impure and most unclean origin no good can possibly emerge, for the individual is thinking all the time about his own merit and righteousness. Some go even further, 
and look down on everybody else, as the Lord teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:9-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:9-14</a>. And others' attitudes are different again. People's selfish desires intermingle in such a way that the outside may look good while 
the inside is filthy. The good therefore that a person does in this state is not the good of faith. And the same applies to the truth he thinks. What he thinks may be the perfect truth; but as long 
as the proprium is the source of it, though it is in itself the truth of faith, he does not have the good of faith within him. To be the truth of faith all truth must include from the Lord the good 
of faith. Only then do they become good and truth. </p>

</p><b>874.</b>
Hic describitur primus status regenerationis hominis hujus Ecclesiae post tentationem, qui communis est omnibus qui regenerantur; nempe, quod putent ex semet bonum facere et verum cogitare, et quia 
adhuc in obscurissimo sunt, etiam Dominus relinquit iis ita opinari: sed usque omne bonum quod faciunt et omne verum quod cogitant, cum in tali opinione sunt, quae falsa non est bonum et verum fidei; 
nam quicquid homo ex semet producit, non potest esse bonum quia a semet, qui est fons impurus et immundissimus; a fonte impuro et immundissimo nusquam potest bonum exire, cogitat enim semper de merito 
et justitia sui; quidam adhuc plus, contemnunt prae se alios, sicut Dominus docet Luc. xviii 9-14; alii aliter; propriae cupiditates se admiscent ita ut appareat extus sicut bonum et usque intus est 
spurcum; quare bonum quod in hoc statu facit homo, non est bonum fidei. Similiter se habet cum vero quod cogitat, tametsi verissimum foret quod cogitat, usque quamdiu ex proprio, est in se quidem verum 
fidei, sed ei bonum fidei non in est; omne verum ut sit verum fidei, ei bonum fidei a Domino inesse debet, tunc primum fit bonum et verum. </p>
