<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3209节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3209.</strong>“仆人就将所办的一切事都告诉以撒”表通过神性属世人发觉真实情况如何。这从“告诉”、“仆人”和“事”的含义清楚可知：“告诉”是指发觉，因为发觉是一种内在告诉，故在圣言的历史描述中，发觉用动词“告诉”和“说”来表述（<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="1819.htm">1819</a>，<a href="1822.htm">1822</a>，<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2080.htm">2080</a>，<a href="2619.htm">2619</a>，<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>节）；“仆人”在此是指神性属世人，如下文所述；“事”是指真实事物（参看<a href="1785.htm">1785</a>节）。由此明显可知，“仆人就将所办的一切事都告诉以撒”表神圣理性良善通过神性属世人发觉真实情况如何。<br />此中情况是这样：理性所在的层级高于属世层，主里面的理性良善是神性。但要从属世人被提升上来的真理并非神性，除非它与神圣理性良善联结。因此，为了理性良善能流入属世层，必须有一个媒介。该媒介只能是享有神性的某种属世之物，这由“亚伯拉罕家的老仆人，那管理他所有一切的”来代表（<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>，<a href="3020.htm">3020</a>节），因为这仆人表示神性属世人（<a href="3191.htm">3191</a>，<a href="3192.htm">3192</a>，<a href="3204.htm">3204</a>，<a href="3206.htm">3206</a>节）。</p>

The servant told Isaac all the words that he had done. That this signifies perception from the Divine natural as to how the case was, appears from the signification of "telling" as being to perceive; 
for perception is a kind of internal telling; wherefore perceiving, in the historicals of the Word, is expressed by "telling," and also by "saying" (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 
2862); and also from the signification here of the "servant," as being the Divine natural (concerning which presently); and from the signification of "words," as being actual things (see n. 1785); from 
which considerations it is plain that "the servant told all the words that he had done," signifies that Divine good rational perceived from the Divine natural how the case was. The case herein is this: 
The rational is in a degree above the natural, and rational good in the Lord was Divine; but the truth which was to be elevated out of the natural was not Divine until it was conjoined with the Divine 
good of the rational. In order therefore that the good of the rational might flow into the natural, there must be a medium; this medium could be nothing else than something natural which should 
partake of the Divine; and this is represented by the "elder servant in Abraham's house, administering all things which he had" (n. 3019, 3020); and that this "servant" signifies the Divine natural, may 
be seen above (n. 3191, 3192, 3204, 3206). </p>

'The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done' means perception from the Divine Natural showing how real things stood now. This is clear from the meaning of 'telling' as perceiving, for perception 
is so to speak an internal telling, and therefore perceiving is expressed in historical descriptions in the Word by the verb 'to tell', and also 'to say', <a href="1741.htm">1741</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="1819.htm">1819</a>, <a href="1822.htm">1822</a>, <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2080.htm">2080</a>, <a href="2619.htm">2619</a>, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>; from the meaning of 'the servant' here as the Divine Natural, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the things' as real things, dealt with in <a href="1785.htm">1785</a>. From all this it is evident that 
'the servant told all the things that he had done' means that Divine Rational Good perceived from the Divine Natural how real things stood now. </p>

 The situation is that the rational part of the 
mind exists in the degree above the natural, and Rational Good within the Lord was Divine. Truth however which was to be raised up from the natural was not Divine until joined to the Divine Good of the 
Rational. So that the Good of the Rational might flow into the natural therefore, there had to be a means in between. This means could not be anything else than the natural which was to partake of 
the Divine. This is represented by the oldest servant of Abraham's house administering all that he had, <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, <a href="3020.htm">3020</a>, for that servant means the Divine Natural, see <a href="3191.htm">3191</a>, <a href="3192.htm">3192</a>, <a href="3204.htm">3204</a>, <a href="3206.htm">3206</a>. </p>

`Narrabat servus Jishako omnia verba quae fecit': quod significet perceptionem ex Divino Naturali quomodo se res haberet, constat a significatione `narrare' quod sit percipere; perceptio enim est quasi 
narratio interna, quapropter percipere in historicis Verbi exprimitur per `narrare,' et quoque per `dicere,' n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862; ex significatione `servi' hic 
quod sit Divinum Naturale, de qua sequitur; et (c)ex significatione `verborum' quod sint res, de qua n. 1785; ex quibus patet quod `narrabat servus omnia verba quae fecit' significet quod Divinum Bonum 
Rationale perceperit a Divino Naturali quomodo se res haberet.  [2] Res {1}ita se habet: rationale est in gradu supra naturale, ac Rationale{2} Bonum in Domino fuit Divinum, verum autem quod {3}elevaretur 
e naturali, non fuit Divinam priusquam conjunctum Divino Bono Rationalis; ut itaque Bonum Rationalis influeret in naturale, erit medium; medium non aliud esse potuit quam naturale quod participaret 
a Divino; hoc repraesentatur per `servum seniorem domus Abrahami administrantem omnia quae ei,' n. 3019, 3020, qui quod significet Divinum Naturale, videatur n. 3191, 3192, 3204, 3206. @1 i enim$
