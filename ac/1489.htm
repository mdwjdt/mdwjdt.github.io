<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1489节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1489.</strong>“因亚伯兰妻子撒莱”表因要与属天之物联结的真理。这从“妻子”的含义，因而“他的妻子撒莱”的含义清楚可知，“他的妻子撒莱”表要与属天之物联结的真理，前面已说明（12:12）。情况是这样：童年时期获得的记忆知识所起到的作用就是使人变得理性；除非这些记忆知识被摧毁，以至于如同没有，否则，真理永远无法与属天之物结合；这些最初的记忆知识绝大部分是尘世、肉体和世俗的；无论孩童时所吸收的诫命何等神圣，他仍旧对它们没有任何概念，只有从这类记忆知识所得之物；因此，只要他抱着这些最低级的记忆知识不放，并由此获得自己的观念，其心智就无法被提升。这和主的情形一模一样，因为祂象其他人那样出生，并和其他人一样接受教导，只是祂遵照的是前面所提及的神序。关于亚伯兰在埃及的这些细节就包含了对该神序的描述，即主的外在人如何与内在人结合，以便外在人也可以变成神性。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1489.</strong> Because of this word of Sarai, Abram's wife, means because truth needs to be connected with something heavenly. This can be seen from the symbolism of a wife, and so of Sarai the wife, as truth that needs to be connected with something heavenly, discussed above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1489/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_12" target=_top>12</a> [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1489/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1473" target=_top>1473</a>].<br />The situation is that unless facts 钬?which filled a purpose when we were young 钬?are destroyed and obliterated as we become rational, truth can never be wedded to any heavenly quality. Those first facts, for the most part, are earthly, bodily, and worldly in their purpose. Even though the commandments that we absorb as young people are divine, we cannot form any notions about them except on the basis of facts like those. As long as the lowly facts from which we form our ideas cling to us, then, our minds cannot be lifted up.<br />It was the same in the Lord's case, because he was born like any other person and had to be taught like any other person, although his progress followed a divine plan, whose nature has been discussed.{*1} The present story of Abram in Egypt depicts the divine plan by which the Lord's outer self was united with his inner self so that his outer self too would become divine.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg has described a divine plan for the Lord's advancement as the inner meaning throughout the chapter; for a summary of the process with references, see note 7 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1489/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1401" target=_top>1401</a>.

Because of Sarai, Abram's wife. That this signifies because of the truth that was to be adjoined to what is celestial, is evident from the signification of a "wife," and consequently of "Sarai the wife," 
as being truth that is to be adjoined to the celestial, concerning which above, at verse 12. The case is this: unless the knowledges which in childhood have performed the use of making the man rational, 
are destroyed, so that they are as nothing, truth can never be conjoined with what is celestial. These first memory-knowledges are for the most part earthly, corporeal, and worldly. However Divine 
may be the precepts that a child learns, he still has no other idea concerning them than that which is obtainable from such knowledges; and therefore, so long as those lowest knowledges cling to 
him, from which are his ideas, his mind cannot be elevated. With the Lord it was the same, because He was born as are other men, and was to be instructed as are others, but according to Divine order, 
which is such as has been stated. In these things which are said concerning Abram in Egypt, there is described the Divine order-how in the Lord the external man was conjoined with the internal, so that 
the external also might become Divine. </p>

'Because of Sarai,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Abram's wife' means because of the truth that was to be allied to the celestial. This is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' and therefore of 'Sarai his wife' as truth that was to 
be allied to the celestial, dealt with above at verse 12. The implications are as follows: Unless the facts which have performed the use in childhood of making the person rational are destroyed so that 
they are nothing, truth cannot possibly be joined to the celestial. Those first facts are for the most part earthly, bodily, and worldly. No matter how Divine the commandments may be that a child absorbs, 
he nevertheless gains from them no other mental picture than what may be obtained from such facts. Therefore as long as those very lowly facts from which he gets his ideas remain with him, the 
mind cannot be raised any higher. It was just the same with the Lord, for He was born like any other and had to receive instruction like any other, though according to the Divine order such as has been 
stated already. Contained within these details regarding Abram in Egypt is a description of the Divine order, of the way in which with the Lord the external Man was joined to the Internal to make the 
External Man Divine as well.

'Propter verbum Sarai uxoris Abrami': quod significet propter verum adjungendum caelesti, constat a Significatione 'uxoris,' proinde 'Sarai uxoris,' quod sit verum adjungendum caelesti, de quo supra 
ad vers. 12.  Ita se res habet: nisi scientifica quae usum, praestiterunt in pueritia ut rationalis fiat homo, destruantur, sic ut nihili sint, nusquam potest verum conjungi caelesti; scientifica illa 
prima sunt ad plurimam partem terrestria, corporea, mundana; utcumque praecepta sunt Divina quae puer haurit, usque non aliam ideam habet de illis quam ex talibus scientificis; quare quamdiu adhaerent 
infima illa scientifica ex quibus ideae, non elevari mens potest: apud Dominum similiter, quia natus ut alius homo et instruendus ut alius, sed secundum ordinem Divinum qui talis, ut dictum: describitur 
in his quae de Abramo in Aegypto, ordo Divinus quomodo Externus Homo conjungitur Interno apud Dominum, ut etiam Externus fieret Divinus. </p>
