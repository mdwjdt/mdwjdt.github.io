<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8601节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8601.</strong>“并且约书亚照着摩西对他所说的去行”表进行争战的真理照着神性真理的指示行事。这从“行”和“照着摩西对他所说的”的含义，以及“约书亚”的代表清楚可知：“行”是指实施；“约书亚”是指进行争战的真理（参看<a href="8595.htm">8595</a>节）；“照着摩西对他所说的”是指照着神性真理的指示，因为“摩西”代表神性真理，“说”表示它的指示。</p>

And Joshua did as Moses had said to him. That this signifies the effect, as the fighting truth had been instructed by Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "doing," as being the effect; 
from the representation of Joshua, as being fighting truth (see just above, n. 8595); and from the signification of "as Moses had said to him," as being as it had been instructed by Divine truth. For 
by Moses is represented Divine truth, and by "as he said" is signified to be instructed by it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8601</b></p><p><b>8601.</b>
'And Joshua did as Moses said to him' means that the truth which engages in conflict acted as directed by Divine Truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'doing' as putting into effect; from the representation 
of 'Joshua' as truth that engages in conflict, dealt with just above in <a href="8595.htm">8595</a>; and from the meaning of 'as Moses said to him' as, as directed by Divine Truth, since 'Moses' represents Divine 
Truth, and 'said' means being directed by it. </p>

</p><b>8601.</b>
`Et fecit Joschua quemadmodum dixit illi Moscheh': quod significet effectum sicut verum pugnans a Divino Vero instructum est, constat ex significatione `facere' quod sit effectus, ex repraesentatione 
`Joschuae' quod sit verum pugnans, de qua mox supra n. 8595, et ex significatione `quemadmodum dixit illi Moscheh' quod sit sicut a Divino Vero instructum est, nam per `Moschen' repraesentatur Divinum 
Verum, et per `dixit' significatur instrui ab illo. </p>
