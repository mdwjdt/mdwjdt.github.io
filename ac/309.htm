<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>309.</strong>“剑的火焰自行转动”表我欲及其所生的疯狂的欲望和信念，人虽渴望了解，却被疯狂的欲望和信念牵引，以致落入肉体和尘世中。关于这一点，圣经有很多段落可以证明，在此我仅举一例：“人子啊，你要说预言。耶和华吩咐我如此说，有刀，有刀，是磨快擦亮的。磨快为要行杀戮，擦亮为要像闪电。我耶和华要使这刀，就是致死伤的刀，一连三次加倍刺人，进入他们的内屋，使大人受死伤的就是这刀。我设立这恐吓人的刀，攻击他们的一切城门，使他们的心消化，加增他们跌倒的事。哎，这刀造得像闪电！”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.9.htm">21:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.15.htm">15</a>）在此，“刀”表使人荒废，使他对良善和真理一无所见，只见错误和对立，亦即此处“加增他们跌倒的事”所表之义。另外再补充一例：“马兵争先，刀剑发光，枪矛闪烁，被杀的甚多。”（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.3.htm">3:3</a>）说的也是渴望了解信之奥秘的人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]309.</strong> The flame of a sword turning itself symbolizes self-love with its mad desires and delusions, which are such that although we want to enter there, we are carried in the opposite direction, toward bodily and earthly preoccupations. So many quotations from the Word are available to prove this symbolism that they would fill pages. Let me offer only these words from Ezekiel:<br />Prophesy, and you are to say, "This is what Jehovah has said: ‘Say, "A sword! A sword sharpened and even polished for committing slaughter, sharpened to have a flash of lightning to it!" Let the sword be used again a third time, the sword of its victims, the sword of much stabbing, penetrating to them in their private rooms, so that their heart will dissolve; and it will multiply the stumbling blocks in all their gates. I have put a terror of a sword there; oh, it has turned into lightning!'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_309/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_21_9-10" target=_top>Ezekiel 21:9-10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_309/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_21_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>)<br />The sword stands for our desolation — desolation to the point where we see not a bit of goodness or truth but only the false things that stand in the way; this is the multiplying of stumbling blocks. Let me add these words in Nahum:<br />A horse rider rushing up, and the flame of a sword, and the lightning flash of a spear, and a throng of those stabbed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_309/bible_king-james-version_nahum_3_3" target=_top>Nahum 3:3</a>)<br />This describes people who wish to pry into the secrets of faith. </p>

That by the "flame of a sword turning itself" is signified self-love [amor proprius] with its insane cupidities and persuasions, which are such that they desire to enter [into the mysteries of faith], 
but are carried away to corporeal and earthly things, might be confirmed by so many passages from the Word as would fill pages; but we will cite only these from Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Prophesy and say, Thus 
saith Jehovah, Say a sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also burnished to make a sore slaughter; it is sharpened that it may be as lightning. Let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of his 
slain; the sword of a great slaughter, which entereth into their bed-chambers, that their heart may melt, and their offenses be multiplied, I have set the terror of the sword in all their gates. Alas! 
it is made as lightning (Ezek. 21:9, 10, 14, 15). A "sword" here signifies the desolation of man such that he sees nothing that is good and true, but mere falsities and things contrary, denoted by 
"multiplying offenses." It is also said in Nahum, of those who desire to enter into the mysteries of faith, "The horseman mounting, and the flame of the sword, and the flash of the spear, and a multitude 
of the slain" (Nah. 3:3). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 309</b></p><p><b>309.</b>
'The flame of a sword turning itself this way and that' means self-love together with its insane desires and persuasions, which are such that people do indeed wish to enter in but are in fact led away 
from there towards bodily and earthly interests. This may be confirmed by so many examples from the Word as to fill up page after page. Take simply the following verses in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Prophesy and 
say, Thus said Jehovah, Say: A sword, a sword has been sharpened and also polished for a great slaughter, sharpened to flash like lightning. Let the sword be repeated a third time, the sword of their 
slain,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the sword of the great slaughter, penetrating the inmost parts of their dwellings that their heart may melt. And it will multiply offences in all their gates; I have given the terror of the sword. 
Ah! It has become as lightning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2021:9,%2010,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 21:9, 10, 14, 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The sword' here stands for the desolate condition of a person so that he sees no good or truth at all, but sheer falsities and things 
that are contrary, meant by 'multiplying offences'. And the phrases in Nahum about the horseman mounting, and the flame of a sword, and the lightning-flash of a spear and a multitude of slain,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum 3:3&version=ESV&interface=print&showfn=yes&showxref">
Nahum 3:3</a>, refer to people who wish to enter into the arcana of faith.

Quod per 'flammam gladii vertentis se' significetur amor proprius cum ejus vesanis cupiditatibus et persuasionibus, quae sunt tales ut quidem intrare velint, sed ferantur inde ad corporea et terrestria, 
tam multis confirmari potest ex Verbo ut paginas impleret; solum haec quae apud Ezechielem; </p>
<p>Propheta et dicas, Sic dixit Jehovah, Dic, gladius, gladius exacutus, et etiam tersus ad mactandum mactationem, 
acutus ut sit ei fulgur;...iteretur gladius tertio, gladius confossorum suorum, gladius confossionis magnae, penetrans in cubicula ad eos, ut liquefiat cor, et multiplicabit offendicula, in 
omnibus portis eorum, dedi terrorem gladii, heu factus in fulgur, xxi {1} 14, 15, 19, 20; </p>
