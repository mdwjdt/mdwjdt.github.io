<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7368节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7368.</strong>之所说“为了他自己和属于他的人”，是因为他与这些人合而为一，这些人也与他合而为一。例如，当有人做事是为了他的妻子、儿子、孙子、女婿和儿媳时，他就是为自己而做的，因为他们是属于他的。为赞同他的爱并由此与他结合的亲朋好友而做事的人也是如此。因为他们通过这种结合与他合而为一，也就是说，在他里面关注他们自己，在他们自己里面关注他。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7368</b></p><p><b>7368.</b>
It is said "for the sake of himself and those who belong to him," because he together with these, and these together with him, make a one; just as when anyone does anything for the sake of his wife, 
of his children, grandchildren, sons-in-law, or daughters-in-law, he does it for the sake of himself, because they are his. In like manner one who does anything for the sake of relatives and of friends 
who favor his love and thereby conjoin themselves with him; for by such conjunction they make one with him, that is, regard themselves in him, and him in themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7368</b></p><p><b>7368.</b>
That person is said to act for his own sake and that of kith and kin because he makes one with them, and they make one with him. When for instance anyone does something for the sake of his wife, children, 
grandchildren, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law, he does it for his own sake since they are his own. The same is true of him who does it for the sake of other relatives, and for the sake of friends 
who go along with his love and thereby link themselves to him. For by being linked to him in that way they make one with him, that is, they see themselves bound up with him, and him with them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7368</b>
</p><b>7368.</b>
Propter semet et suos dicitur quia ille cum suis et sui cum illo unum faciunt; prout cum quis propter uxorem, liberos, nepotes, generos, nurus aliquid facit, is propter semet facit quia sui sunt; pariter 
qui propter affines et propter amicos qui favent ipsius amori et per id se ei conjungunt, {1}nam illi per talem conjunctionem constituunt unum cum illo, hoc est, spectant se in illo et illum in 
se. 	@1 ac$ </p>
