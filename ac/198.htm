<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第198节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>198.</strong>创世记3:2-3 女人对蛇说，园中树上的果子，我们可以吃，惟有园当中那棵树上的果子，神曾说，你们不可吃，也不可摸，免得你们死。<br />“园中树上的果子”，表上古教会揭示给他们的良善与真理，“园子当中那棵树上的果子”，表属乎信的良善与真理。“不可吃”，表示不可凭自己了解，“不可摸”，表示不可凭自己的感官和知识思考属乎信的良善与真理，“免得你们死”，表示凭感官和思考所得的信仰、智慧、聪明，都必消失。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]198.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_198/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_2-3" target=_top>Genesis 3:2-3</a>. And the woman said to the snake, "We are to eat from the fruit of the tree of the garden; but from the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You shall not eat from it, nor are you to touch it, or you will die from it.'"<br />The fruit of the tree of the garden means the goodness and truth revealed to [this third generation] by the people of the earliest church. The fruit of the tree that was in the middle of the garden, from which they were not to eat, means religious goodness and truth, which they were not to learn about from themselves. The ban on touching it means that they were also not to think about religious goodness and truth from themselves, or from their senses and the facts they knew. That they would die from it means that this is how faith — that is, all wisdom and understanding — would perish. </p>

Verses 2, 3. And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat 
of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. The "fruit of the tree of the garden" is the good and truth revealed to them from the Most Ancient Church; the "fruit of the tree which is in the midst of 
the garden, of which they were not to eat" is the good and truth of faith, which they were not to learn from themselves; "not to touch it" is a prohibition against thinking of the good and truth of 
faith from themselves, or from what is of sense and "memory-knowledge [sensuali et scientifico]; "lest ye die" is because thus faith, or all wisdom and intelligence, would perish. </p>

Verses 2, 3 And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit from the tree of the garden we are to eat; but of the fruit from the tree which is in the middle of the garden God has said, You shall not 
eat of it nor touch it, or else you will die. 'The fruit from the tree of the garden' is the good and truth revealed to them from the Most Ancient Church. 'The fruit from the tree which was in the middle 
of the garden, of which they were not to eat' is the good and truth of faith, which they were forbidden to learn from themselves. 'Not to touch it' means that they were forbidden to think about the 
good and truth of faith from themselves, that is, from sensory perception and factual knowledge. 'Or else they would die' means that faith, that is, all wisdom and intelligence, would in this way perish.  </p>

</p><b>198.</b>
Vers. 2, 3.  Et dixit mulier ad serpentem, De fructu arboris horti comedemus; Et de fructu arboris, quae in medio horti, dixit Deus, Non comedetis de illo, nec tangetis illum, ne inde moriamini. 'Fructus 
arboris horti' est bonum et veram revelatum iis ab Antiquissima Ecclesia; 'fructus arboris, quae in medio horti, de quo non comederent' est bonum et verum fidei, quod non discerent ex semet; 'non 
tangere illum' est quod nec cogitarent de bono et vero fidei ex semet seu ex sensuali et scientifico; quod 'inde morerentur' est quod sic periret fides seu omnis sapientia et intelligentia. </p>
