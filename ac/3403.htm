Verses 12-14. And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in that year a hundred measures, and Jehovah blessed him. And the man increased, and went on going and increasing until he became exceeding great. 
And he had acquisition of flock, and acquisition of herd, and much service; and the Philistines envied him. "And Isaac sowed in that land," signifies interior truths which are from the Lord appearing 
to the rational; "and found in that year a hundred measures," signifies abundance; "and Jehovah blessed him," signifies as to the good of love therein; "and the man increased, and went on going and 
increasing until he became exceeding great," signifies successive increase; "and he had acquisition of flock, and acquisition of herd," signifies as to interior good, and as to exterior good; "and much 
service," signifies the truth therefrom; "and the Philistines envied him," signifies that they who were in the mere memory-knowledge of knowledges did not apprehend. </p>

<p>'Isaac sowed in that land' means interior truths from the Lord as they appear 
to the rational. 'And he reaped in that year a hundred measures' means an abundance. 'And Jehovah blessed him' means as regards the good that flows from love within them. 'And the man increased, and 
went on increasing, so much so that he became extremely prosperous' means increases. 'And he had acquired flocks, and had acquired herds' means as regards interior good and as regards exterior good. 'And 
he had many servants' means truth derived from that good. 'And the Philistines envied him' means that people governed by no more than a knowledge of cognitions did not have any grasp of such good 
and truth.

Vers. 12-14.  Et seminavit Jishak in terra illa, et invenit in anno illo centum mensuras; et benedixit ei Jehovah. Et crevit vir, et ivit eundo et crescendo, usque ut magnus factus valde. Et fuit ei 
acquisitio gregis, et acquisitio armenti, et servitium multum; et invidebant ei Philistaei. `Seminavit Jishak in terra illa' significat vera interiora apparentia ad rationale quae a Domino; `et invenit 
in anno illo centum mensuras' significat abundantiam: `et benedixit ei Jehovah' significat quoad bonum amoris in illis: `et crevit vir, et ivit eundo et crescendo, usque ut magnus factus valde' significat 
incrementa: `et fuit ei acquisitio gregis et acquisitio armenti' significat quoad bonum interius, et quoad bonum exterius: `et servitium multum' significat inde verum: `et invidebant ei Philistaei' 
significat quod qui in scientia sola cognitionum non caperent. </p>
