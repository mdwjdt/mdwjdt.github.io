<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2691节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2691.</strong>“神听见孩子的声音”表当时的帮助。这从“神听见声音”用于历史意义时的含义，以及“孩子”的含义清楚可知：就内义而言，“神听见声音”是指带来帮助；“孩子”是指属灵真理，如前所述。此处的状态就真理而言，是有属灵之物在其中的。因为经上说“神听见孩子的声音”，接着在本节又说“孩子在那里所发的声音，神已经听见了”，也就是在什么样的状态下。前几节已说明，由于损失真理而极度悲伤的人就处于这种状态。经上说神听见的声音是孩子的，而非夏甲的，其原因在于：所论述的主题是属灵之人的状态。“孩子”或以实玛利代表教会成员，“他母亲夏甲”则代表对真理的认知的情感。所感觉到的悲伤就在这情感当中。人类理性是从作为母亲的对记忆知识的情感生出的 （<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>-<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>，<a href="1910.htm">1910</a>，<a href="2094.htm">2094</a>，<a href="2524.htm">2524</a>节），而人的属灵之物则是从由教义，主要由圣言所得对真理的认知的情感生出的。属灵之物本身就是此处的“孩子”，而对真理的认知的情感则是“夏甲”。</p>

God heard the voice of the child. That this signifies help at that time, is evident from the signification of "God hearing a voice," said in the historic sense, as being in the internal sense to bring 
help; and from the signification of the "child," as being spiritual truth-explained before; here it is the state in which the spiritual was as to truth; for it is said that He heard the voice of the 
child, and again in this verse, that He heard the voice of the child where he was, that is, in what state; and in what precedes it was shown that it was in a state of the greatest grief on account of 
the privation of truth. The voice of the child, and not Hagar's, is said to have been heard, because the state of the spiritual man is treated of. By the child, or Ishmael, is represented the man of 
the spiritual church; by his mother Hagar, the affection of the knowledges of truth, which is that which had grief. Man's rational is born of the affection of memory-knowledges as a mother (n. 1895-1896, 
1902, 1910, 2094, 2524); but his spiritual is born of the affection of the knowledges of truth from doctrine, especially from the Word. The spiritual itself is here the "child;" and the affection 
of the knowledges of truth is "Hagar." </p>

'God heard the boy's voice' means help at that point. This is clear from the meaning in the internal sense of 'God hearing the voice 'the words used in the historical sense - as bringing help, and from 
the meaning of 'the boy' as spiritual truth, dealt with already. Here a state is meant in which the spiritual as regards truth existed, for it is said that 'He heard the boy's voice' and soon after 
in this verse that 'He heard the boy's voice where he was', that is to say, where he was as to state. And, in the explanations of the verses immediately before, this state was shown to be one of utmost 
grief because truth had been taken away. The reason it was the boy's voice, not Hagar's, that God is said to have heard is that the state of the spiritual man is the subject. 'The boy', or Ishmael, 
represents the member of the spiritual Church, 'Hagar his mother' the affection for cognitions of truth, it being within this affection that the grief was felt. Man's rational is born from the affection 
for factual knowledge as a mother, <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>,<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>, <a href="1910.htm">1910</a>, <a href="2094.htm">2094</a>, <a href="2524.htm">2524</a>, but his spiritual is born from the affection for cognitions of truth acquired from doctrine, chiefly from the Word. Here the spiritual 
itself is 'the boy', and the affection for cognitions of truth is 'Hagar'. </p>

</p><b>2691.</b>
`Audivit Deus vocem pueri': quod significet tunc auxilium, constat a significatione `audire Deus vocem' in sensu historico quod sit ferre auxilium in sensu interno, et a significatione `pueri' quod 
sit spirituale verum, de qua prius; hic quod sit status in quo spirituale quoad verum esset, nam dicitur quod `audivit vocem pueri,' et mox in hoc versu, `audivit vocem (o)pueri in quo ille ibi,' nempe 
in quo statu, et in praecedentibus, quod in statu summi doloris ob privationem veri esset.  Quod vocem pueri, non Hagaris, dicatur audivisse, es quia de statu spiritualis hominis agitur; per `puerum 
seu Ismaelem' repraesentatur spiritualis Ecclesiae homo, per `Hagarem matrem ejus affectio cognitionum veri, quae est cui dolor; rationale hominis nascitur ab affectione scientiarum ut a matre, n. 1895, 
1896, 1902 {1}, 1910 2094, 2524, sed spirituale ejus ab affectione cognitionum veri ex doctrina, cumprimis ex Verbo; ipsum spirituale est hic `puer,' affectio cognitionum veri est hic `Hagar.' 	@1 
A i 1900, but 1909 was probably intended.$ </p>
