<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1907节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1907.</strong>“撒莱将她给了自己的丈夫亚伯兰为妾”表由对真理的情感所促成的联结。这从前面有关撒莱的论述清楚可知，亚伯兰的妻子撒莱的真正意义是指对真理的情感，也从有关内在人与外层人的生命和情感的联结所述清楚可知，理性就出自该联结。夏甲被送给亚伯兰为妾而不是妻子，是因为按照神性秩序的法则，婚姻若非一夫一妻，就不是婚姻。婚姻之爱绝不可分割。这爱若被分割在数位配偶中，就不是婚姻之爱，而是淫乱之爱。关于这个主题，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p>

And gave her to Abram her man for a woman to him. That this signifies conjunction through the incitation of the affection of truth, is evident from what has already been said concerning Sarai, the wife 
of Abram, as being the affection of truth in the genuine sense; and from what has been said respecting the conjunction of the internal man with the life and affection of the exterior man, whence comes 
the rational. Hagar was not given to Abram for a wife, but for a woman; and this because it is according to a law of Divine order that it is not marriage unless it is that of one man and one wife. 
Conjugial love can never be divided. The love that is divided among a number is not conjugial love, but is that of lasciviousness, on which subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

'And she gave her to Abram her husband as his wife (mulier)' means a joining together prompted by the affection for truth. This is clear from what has been stated above about Sarai, Abram's wife, being 
in the genuine sense the affection for truth, and from what has also been stated about the joining of the internal man to the life and affection of the exterior man, from which conjunction the rational 
is born. Hagar was not given to Abram as a wife (uxor) but as a wife (mulier). The reason for this lies in the law of Divine order that it is not marriage unless it is a marriage of one man to one 
wife. Conjugial love cannot possibly be divided. When love is divided among several partners it is not conjugial love but such as goes with lasciviousness, to be dealt with, in the Lord's Divine mercy, 
later on. </p>

`Et dedit eam Abramo viro suo, illi in mulierem': quod significet conjunctionem incitante affectione veri, constat ex illis quae supra {1} dicta sunt de Sarai uxore Abrami quod sit affectio veri in genuino 
sensu, et ex illis quae dicta {2} sunt de conjunctione interna hominis cum vita et affectione exterioris {3}, unde rationale.  Hagar non data est Abramo in uxorem sed in mulierem, quod inde ducit 
causam quia ex lege ordinis Divini est quod non sit conjugium nisi unius viri et unius uxoris; amor conjugialis nusquam dividi potest; qui dividitur inter plures, non est amor conjugialis sed est lasciviae, 
de qua re, ex Divina Domini misericordia, in sequentibus. 	@1 prius.$ 	@2 i quoque.$ 	@3 externi.$ </p>
