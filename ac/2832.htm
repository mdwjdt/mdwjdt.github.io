<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2832节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2832.</strong>“两角”表以其在信之真理方面的一切力量。这从“两角”的含义清楚可知。“角”在圣言中多处被提及，在那里表示源于良善的真理的力量，在反面意义上则表示源于邪恶的虚假的力量。此处的意思是：“公绵羊”所表示的属灵之人被关乎真理的属世记忆知识及其一切力量缠住了，结果丧失了觉察真理的力量。因为在关乎系信之真理的事物上，人越仰赖属世的记忆知识，并纠缠于其中，就越丧失真理之光，并因丧失这光而丧失真理的生命。若肯停下来深入思考一下，谁都能从以下经验知道这一点：有些人声称他们什么也不信，除非他们能通过感官经验或事实知识明白事情确是如此。若探究他们的本质，你会发现他们根本什么也不信，而且在他们看来，似乎没有什么比将一切事物归于大自然更有智慧的了。还有许多人声称自己尽管不理解，但仍旧相信，而私下里，他们和其他人一样通过感官经验和事实知识推理信之真理，推理事情是否如此。这些人要么拥有一种从我欲和物欲所注入的说服性信仰，要么根本没有任何信仰。其本质从他们的生活就能明显看出来。诚然，这两种人在主的属灵教会中，却不属教会。凡属教会的人都过着良善的生活，并相信真理。但属灵之人除了从小被铭刻在他们心里，后来他们通过教义或某个其它源头所确认的真理之外，并不相信其它真理。这就是属灵之人的状态，这种状态在此被描述为“两角缠在灌木丛中的公绵羊”（参看<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>节）。<br />“角”表源于良善的真理的力量，这从以下经文明显看出来。诗篇：<br />你是他们力量的荣耀，因你的喜悦，你必高举我们的角。我们的盾牌属耶和华；我们的王属以色列的圣者。只是我的真理和我的慈爱要与他同在，因我的名，他的角必被高举。我要使他的手伸到海上，右手伸到河上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.17.htm">89:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.25.htm">25</a>）<br />此处“我们的角”和“他的角”明显表真理的力量。这里论述的是主的属灵国度；“我们的王属以色列的圣者”表神圣真理属于主。“王”是指真理，主的王权是指神圣真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。“手伸到海上，右手伸到河上”表那力量居于记忆知识和对真理的认知中。“手”和“右手”表力量（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节），“海”和“河”表记忆知识和认知（<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>节）。诗篇：<br />耶和华我的力量啊，我爱你！耶和华是我的岩石，我的山寨，我的救主，我的神，我的磐石，我所投靠的，是我的盾牌，是拯救我的角。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.1.htm">18:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.2.htm">2</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下22.2.htm">22:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下22.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“拯救的角”表真理的力量；此处“力量”、“岩石”、“山寨”、“神”、“磐石”和“盾牌”全都表示属灵的真理的力量。<br /><br />在锡安，我必给大卫生起一个角来；我为我的受膏者预备明灯。我要使他的仇敌披上羞耻。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.17.htm">132:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这论述的是主，也就是大卫（<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节）；“角”表真理的力量；“明灯”表真理之光。撒母耳记：<br />我的心因耶和华快乐，我的角因耶和华高举。我的口向仇敌张开，因我以你的救恩欢欣。耶和华必将力量赐与祂的王，高举祂所膏立的角。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这是哈拿的预言；“角”表真理的力量。<br />摩西书：<br />他为牛群中头生的，有威严；他的角是野牛的角，用以抵触万民，直到地极。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.17.htm">33:17</a>）<br />这是摩西关于约瑟的预言，“野牛的角”表真理的强大力量。这也可从经上说他要用它们“抵触万民，直到地极”明显看出来。同样在诗篇：<br />你却高举了我的角，如野牛的角。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗92.10.htm">92:10</a>）<br /><br />耶和华啊，救我脱离狮子的口；你已经应了我脱离野牛的角。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗22.21.htm">22:21</a>）<br />神圣真理因其高而被称为“野牛的角”。正因如此，经上多次提及角被高举，因为高举表源于内在的力量。至于内在之物以“高物”来表述，可参看前文（<a href="1735.htm">1735</a>，<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>节）。<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />主发烈怒，把以色列的角全然砍断，在仇敌面前收回右手。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.3.htm">2:3</a>）<br />“把以色列的角全然砍断”表丧失拥有力量的真理。这也是“在仇敌面前收回右手”的含义。以西结书：<br />当那日，我必使以色列家的角长出来，又必使你在他们中间开口。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.21.htm">29:21</a>）<br />“使以色列家的角长出来”表使“以色列”所表示的属灵教会的真理增多；“开口”表对这些真理的告白。<br />哈巴谷书：<br />神从提幔而来，圣者从巴兰山临到。祂的荣光遮蔽诸天，颂赞充满大地。祂的辉煌如同亮光；祂有从祂手里发出的两角，在其中藏着祂的能力。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.3.htm">3:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这论述的是主；“祂有从祂手里发出的两角，在其中藏着祂的能力”明显表真理的力量；“巴兰山”是指主之人性的神性属灵之物或神圣真理（参看<a href="2714.htm">2714</a>节），也就是“辉煌”和“亮光”。<br />在启示录，主之人性的神圣真理如此被描述：<br />我观看，又见宝座正中、就是四活物正中宝座，有羔羊站立，像是被杀过的，有七角，就是神的七灵，被派往全地。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.6.htm">5:6</a>）<br />“七角”表神圣或神圣真理。“七”表神圣（参看<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）。是指“被派往全地的七灵”是指对这些真理的神圣宣告。、<br />“坛角”无非表拥有力量的真理。在摩西书，经上论到它们说：<br />要在坛的四拐角上作四个角；它的角要与坛接连一块。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.2.htm">27:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.2.htm">38:2</a>）<br />同样烧香的坛要有四角，并且经上说，角要与坛接连一块（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.2.htm">30:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.25.htm">37:25</a>）。坛是主以及敬拜祂的主要代表物（参看<a href="921.htm">921</a>节）。“坛”是其神圣良善的代表物；“角”是其神圣真理的代表物；从它，即从坛上作四角代表真理源于良善。除了源于良善的真理外，没有其它真理存在（参看<a href="654.htm">654</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>，<a href="1176.htm">1176</a>，<a href="1608.htm">1608</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2261.htm">2261</a>，<a href="2429.htm">2429</a>节）。由此明显可知，就真正意义而言，“角”表源于良善的真理的力量。<br />下面的例子所指的就是源于良善的真理：当亚伦和他的儿子获许承接圣职时，他们要取公牛的血，用指头抹在坛的四角上（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.12.htm">29:12</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.15.htm">8:15</a>）；亚伦一年一次在坛的角上行赎罪之礼（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.10.htm">30:10</a>）；祭司犯了罪，就当献上公牛犊，把血抹在香坛的四角上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.3.htm">4:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.7.htm">7</a>）；官长犯了罪，就当献燔祭，把血洒在燔祭坛的四角上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.22.htm">4:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.25.htm">25</a>）；民中有人犯了罪也要这样行（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.27.htm">4:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.34.htm">34</a>）；在坛上行赎罪之礼时亦是（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.18.htm">16:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.19.htm">19</a>）。所有这些事都表示源于良善的真理；因为一切祝圣礼、就职礼和洁净礼都通过真理来进行，因为真理引向良善（<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>节）。“坛角”表源于良善的真理，这也可见于启示录：<br />第六位天使吹号，我就听见有声音从神面前金坛的四角出来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.13.htm">9:13</a>）<br />“金坛的四角”明显表源于良善的真理，因为声音就是从四角出来的。“金”表良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节），“金坛”更是表良善。<br />阿摩司书：<br />我察罚以色列的悖逆那日子，我也必察罚伯特利的祭坛；坛角必被砍下，坠落于地。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />“坛角必被砍下”是因为那个地方不再有对源于良善的真理的代表性；“伯特利”是指神圣良善，因而被称为“王的圣所”、“王的宫殿”（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩7.13.htm">7:13</a>）。用角里的膏油膏王（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上16.1.htm">16:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上16.13.htm">13</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上1.39.htm">1:39</a>）同样代表源于良善的真理。“油”是指良善（<a href="886.htm">886</a>节）；“角”是指真理；就内义而言，“王权”本身是指这类真理（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>节），这类真理拥有力量。<br />“角”在反面意义上表示源于邪恶的虚假的力量，这从以下经文明显看出来。阿摩司书：<br />你们喜爱虚浮的事，说，我们不是凭自己的力量为自己取了角吗？（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.13.htm">6:13</a>）<br />此处“角”表虚假的力量。撒迦利亚书：<br />我举目观看，见有四角。我就对与我说话的天使说，这是什么意思？他对我说，这是打散犹大、以色列和耶路撒冷的角。耶和华又指四个匠人给我看。我说，这些人来做什么呢？祂说，这是打散犹大的角，使人不敢抬头；但这些人来威吓列族，打掉它们的角，就是举起来抵触犹大地、使它四散的角。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.18.htm">1:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“角”表荒废教会的虚假的力量。以西结书：<br />因为你们用胁用肩拥挤一切瘦弱的，又用角抵触，直到使他们四散到外面。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.21.htm">34:21</a>）<br />这论述的是被虚假所误导的牧人；“角”表虚假的力量；“肩”表他们所拥有的全部力量（<a href="1085.htm">1085</a>节）。耶利米哀歌：<br />耶和华倾覆了，并不顾惜，使仇敌向你夸耀，使你敌人的角也被高举。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.17.htm">2:17</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />摩押的角砍断了，摩押的膀臂折断了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.25.htm">48:25</a>）<br />此处“角”表有力的虚假。<br />诗篇：<br />我对夸耀人说，不要夸耀。对邪恶人说，不要举角！不要把你们的角高举；不要挺着颈项说话。恶人一切的角，我要砍断；惟有义人的角必被高举。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗75.4.htm">75:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗75.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗75.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“邪恶人的角”表源于邪恶的虚假的力量；“义人的角”表源于良善的真理的力量。<br />但以理书：<br />见第四兽甚是可怕，极其强壮，大有力量。它有铁牙，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。这兽有十角。我正思考这些角，见其中又长起一个小角，先前的角中有三角在这角前连根拔出来。看哪，这角有眼，像人的眼，有口说夸大的话。那时，因那小角说着夸大之话的声音，我就观看。那时我愿知道第四兽的真情，头有十角和那另长的一角，有三角倒在这角面前。这角有眼，有说夸大话的口。我观看，见这角与圣民争战。他说，第四兽就是世上必有的第四国，与一切国大不相同，必吞吃全地，并且践踏嚼碎。至于那十角，就是从这国中必兴起的十王，在他们以后，又兴起一王，与先前的不同，他必制伏三王。他必说话顶撞至高者，必折磨圣民；然后审判者要坐堂。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.7.htm">7:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.19.htm">19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />就内义而言，这论述的是教会的败坏状态。但以理在此所看到的这些事物，如兽、铁牙、有眼的角、说话的角和与圣民作战、说话冲撞至高者的角都表示教会里面虚假和异端的状态。“角”表有力和盛行的虚假，这单从以下事实明显可知：“眼”，就是理解力的力量（<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>节）被归给了它们；它们甚至说话冲撞至高者。“国”与“王”不是指国家和国王，而是指虚假的教义。这从它们在圣言中的含义可以看出来，“国”与“王”是指真理的教义，反面意义则是虚假的教义（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>节）。<br />在但以理书的别处：<br />我看见双角的公绵羊站在河边，两角都高，这角高过那角，更高的是后长的。我见那公绵羊往西、往北、往南用角抵触，兽在他面前都站立不住，也没有能救护脱离他手的，但他任意而行，自高自大。我正思想的时候，看哪，众羊中有一只公山羊从西而来，遍行整个地面。这山羊两眼当中有一只角。他来到那公绵羊，就是有双角的领主这里，以其力量的忿怒，向他冲去，猛攻他，折断他的两角。绵羊在他面前没有力量站立。后来，众羊中的这山羊极其自高自大，正强盛的时候，他的大角折断了，又长出四个角取代它。很快，四角之中，有一角长出一个小角，向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，践踏它们。双角的公绵羊，就是玛代和波斯王。那公山羊就是希腊王；取代那断角的四角就是从这个民族兴起的四国。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.1.htm">8:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.27.htm">27</a>）<br />就内义而言，这论述的是“公绵羊”所表示的属灵教会的状态（<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>节）；该教会的状态也有所描述，即它如何逐渐衰落和败坏。“众羊中的公山羊”表那些具有脱离仁爱的信仰，或脱离良善的真理之人，他们开始抬高自己，冲撞良善，最终冲撞主。“公绵羊的双角”是指属灵教会的真理，无论内在的还是外在的；“众羊中公山羊的双角”是指已逐渐退化为虚假的真理；此处所提到的“国”和“王”并非指国家和国王，而是指真理和虚假，如刚才所述。因为从本质上说，主的圣言并不论述世俗和尘世事务，而是论述属灵和属天之物。<br />启示录：<br />天上又现出异象来：看哪，有一条大红龙，七头十角，七头上戴着七个冠冕。他的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一，摔在地上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.3.htm">12:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.4.htm">4</a>）<br /><br />我又看见一个兽从海中上来，有十角七头，在十角上戴着十个冠冕，七头上有亵渎的名号。他得了允许能跟圣徒作战，并且胜过他们。然后，我又看见另有一个兽从地中上来，有两角如同羊羔。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.11.htm">11</a>）<br />启示录：<br />我就看见一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上，满了亵渎之名；有七个头和十个角；就是大巴比伦。那七头就是女人所坐的七座山，又是七位王；十角就是十王。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.3.htm">17:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.13.htm">13</a>）<br />显然，此处的“角”和但以理书中的一样，表虚假的力量。</p>

By his horns. That this signifies with all power in regard to the truths of faith, is evident from the signification of "horns." "Horns" are mentioned in many places in the Word; and there signify the 
power of truth from good; and in the opposite sense the power of falsity from evil; here the meaning is that the spiritual who are signified by the "ram" are entangled in natural memory-knowledge with 
all their might in regard to truth, and hence that they are deprived of the power of perceiving truths. For the more anyone consults natural memory-knowledges, and sticks fast in them in his animus 
and mind in regard to the things which are truths of faith, the more does he lose the light of truth, and with the light, the life of truth. Everyone may know this from experience, if he attends and 
reflects, from those who say that they can believe nothing unless they comprehend that it is so by means of the things of sense, or of memory-knowledge. If you explore their quality, you will find that 
they believe nothing; and moreover that nothing seems to them more wise than to ascribe everything to nature. There are many also who say that they believe although they do not comprehend; when nevertheless, 
in secret with themselves, they reason equally as others do from the things of sense and memory-knowledge concerning the truths of faith, as to whether a thing is so. These either have a kind 
of persuasion breathed in from the love of self and the world, or they do not believe at all. Their quality is manifest from their life. Both classes are indeed in the Lord's spiritual church, but they 
are not of the church. They who are of the church are in a life of good, and have faith in truths; but the spiritual have faith in other truths besides those which have been impressed on them from 
infancy, and which they have afterwards confirmed to themselves from doctrine or from some other source. Such is the state of the spiritual, which state is here described by the "ram caught in the thicket 
by his horns" (see just above, n. 2831).  [2] That a "horn" signifies the power of truth from good, is evident from the following passages. In David: </p>
<p>     Thou art the glory of their strength, 
and in Thy good pleasure wilt Thou exalt our horn; for our shield belongeth unto Jehovah, and our king to the Holy One of Israel. My truth and My mercy shall be with him, and in My name shall his horn 
be exalted; I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers (Ps. 89:17-18, 24-25); </p>
<p>where "our horn" and "his horn" manifestly denote the power of truth. The Lord's spiritual kingdom 
is there treated of; "our king belongs to the Holy One of Israel" denotes that Divine truth belongs to the Lord. (That a "king" is truth, and that the Lord's royalty is the Divine Truth, may be 
seen above, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069); to "put his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers" denotes that strength is in the memory-knowledges and the knowledges of truth. (That the "hand" 
and the "right hand" denote strength, see above, n. 878; and also that the "sea" and the "rivers" denote memory-knowledges and knowledges, n. 28, 2702.) In the same: </p>
<p>     I will love Thee, O Jehovah, 
my strength; Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my strong rock in whom I trust, my shield, and the horn of my salvation (Ps. 18:1-2; 2 Sam. 22:2-3); </p>
<p>the "horn of salvation" 
denotes truth as to power; in this passage "strength," "rock," "fortress," "God," "strong rock," and "shield," are all significative of the power of truth.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     In Zion will I make 
a horn to bud unto David, I will prepare a lamp for Mine anointed; His enemies will I clothe with shame (Ps. 132:17-18); </p>
<p>where the Lord is treated of, who is "David" (n. 1888); a "horn" denotes the 
power of truth; a "lamp," the light of truth. In Samuel: </p>
<p>     My heart hath exulted in Jehovah, my horn is exalted in Jehovah, my mouth is enlarged against mine enemies, because I have been glad in 
Thy salvation. Jehovah will give strength unto His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed (1 Sam. 2:1, 10); </p>
<p>this is the prophecy of Hannah; the "horn" denotes the power of truth.  [4] In Moses: </p>
<p> 
    The firstling of his ox, honor is his, and his horns are the horns of the unicorn; with them shall he push the peoples all of them, to the ends of the earth (Deut. 33:17); </p>
<p>this is the prophecy 
of Moses concerning Joseph, where the "horns of the unicorn" denote the great power of truth, as is manifest also from its being said that he shall "push the peoples with them to the ends of the 
earth." So too in David: </p>
<p>     My horn shalt Thou exalt like the unicorn's (Ps. 92:10). And in the same: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, save me from the mouth of the lion, and answer me from the horns of the unicorn 
(Ps. 22:21); </p>
<p>Divine truths, from their height, are called the "horns of unicorns;" hence the "horn" is so often said to be "exalted," for exaltation signifies power from the interior. (That what is 
internal is represented by what is high, may be seen above, n. 1735, 2148.)  [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel, He hath drawn back His right hand from 
before the enemy (Lam. 2:3); </p>
<p>to "cut off all the horn of Israel" denotes to deprive of truth which has power, which is also to "draw back the right hand from before the enemy." In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     
In that day will I make a horn to grow for the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them (Ezek. 29:21); </p>
<p>to "make the horn to grow for the house of Israel," denotes 
to multiply the truths of the spiritual church, which is "Israel;" the "opening of the mouth" denotes the confession of them.  [6] In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     God will come from Teman, and the Holy One 
from Mount Paran; His honor covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise and His brightness shall be as the light He; had horns out of His hand, and there was the hiding of His strength 
(Hab. 3:3-4); </p>
<p>where the Lord is treated of; that "He had horns out of His hand, and there was the hiding of His strength," plainly denotes the power of truth; that "Mount Paran" is the Divine Spiritual 
or the Divine Truth of the Lord's Human, may be seen above (n. 2714), which also is the "brightness" and the "light."  [7] The Divine Truth of the Lord's Human is thus described in John: </p>
<p>     I saw 
and behold in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, a Lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6); </p>
<p>the "seven 
horns" denote holy or Divine truths. (That "seven" means holy, may be seen above, n. 716, 881.) The "seven spirits sent forth into all the earth," are the holy preachings of the same truths.  [8] 
The "horns of the altars" signified nothing else than truth in which is power. Of these it is said in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt make horns upon the four corners of the altar; out of it shall its horns 
be (Exod. 27:2; 38:2). So too upon the altar of incense, out of which were to be horns (Exod. 30:2; 37:25). (That the altar was a principal representative of the Lord and of His worship, may be seen 
above, n. 921.) The altar was a representative of His Divine Good; the horns were the representatives of His Divine Truth; that truth was from good was represented by the horns being out of it, or out 
of the altar. (That there is no other truth than that which is from good, may be seen above, n. 654, 1162, 1176, 1608, 2063, 2261, 2429.) It is manifest from this that "horns" in the genuine sense signify 
the power of truth which is from good.  [9] That Aaron and his sons, when initiated in the ministry, took of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with the finger (Exod. 
29:12; Lev. 8:15); and that Aaron made expiation upon the horns of the altar once in the year (Exod. 30:10); and that when a priest sinned, he offered a bullock, and put of the blood upon the horns 
of the altar of incense (Lev. 4:3, 7); also that when a prince sinned, he offered a burnt-offering, and the blood was sprinkled upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering (Lev. 4:. 22, 25); and 
that it was the same when a soul sinned (verses 27, 30, 34, of the same chapter); as also when the altar was expiated (Lev. 16:18, 19)-all these things signified truths from good; for all sanctifications, 
inaugurations, and expiations were made by truths, because truths introduce to good (n. 2830). That the "horns of the altar" signified truths which are from good, may also be seen in John: </p>
<p>     
The sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God (Rev. 9:13); </p>
<p>     the "horns of the golden altar" manifestly denote truths from good, for thence 
came the voice (that "gold" is good may be seen above, n. 113, 1551, 1552; and still more the "golden altar").  [10] In Amos: </p>
<p>     In the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon 
him, I will visit upon the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground (Amos 3:14); </p>
<p>that the "horns of the altar were to be cut off," was because truth 
from good was no longer represented there; "Bethel" is the Divine Good, and is therefore called the "king's sanctuary," and the "house of the kingdom" (Amos 7:13). The kings being "anointed with oil 
from a horn" (1 Sam. 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39) represented in like manner truth from good. (The "oil" was good, n. 886; but the "horn," truth; the "royalty" itself in the internal sense is such truth, n. 
1728, 2015, in which is power.)  [11] That a "horn" in the opposite sense signifies the power of falsity which is from evil, is evident from the following passages. In Amos: </p>
<p>     Ye who rejoice in 
a thing of naught, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? (Amos 6:13); </p>
<p>"horns" here denote the power of falsity. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold four 
horns; and I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah; Israel, and Jerusalem. And Jehovah showed me four smiths; and 
I said, What come these to do? And He said, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man doth lift up his head; and these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the 
nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah, to scatter it (Zech. 1:18-21); </p>
<p>the "horns" denote the power of falsity, which vastates the church. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Ye thrust with side 
and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad (Ezek. 34:21); </p>
<p>here the shepherds who seduce by falsities are treated of; the "horns" denote the power 
of falsity; the "shoulder," all power (n. 1085). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath destroyed, and hath not pitied, and He hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; He hath exalted the horn of thine 
adversaries (Lam. 2:17). In the same: </p>
<p>     The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken (Jer. 48:25); </p>
<p>"horn" here denotes powerful falsity.  [12] In David: </p>
<p>     I said to them that were glorying, 
Glory ye not, and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn; lift not up your horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck. All the horns of the wicked will I cut off, the horns of the righteous shall 
be lifted up (Ps. 75:4-5, 10); </p>
<p>the "horns of the wicked" denote the power of falsity from evil; the "horns of the righteous," the power of truth from good.  [13] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     A fourth beast was 
seen, terrible and powerful and strong exceedingly, and it had iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet, and it had ten horns. I considered the horns, and behold 
another little horn came up among them, and three of the first horns were rooted up before it; and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. I held then 
because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I desired certitude concerning the fourth beast, and concerning the ten horns that were on his head, and concerning the other which came 
up, and three fell before it; and concerning the same horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things; I held, and the same horn made war with the saints. And he said, As for the fourth beast, 
it shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. And as for the ten horns, out 
of this kingdom shall ten kings arise, and another shall arise after them, and he shall be diverse from the former ones, and he shall humble three kings; he shall speak words against the Most High, 
and shall wear out the saints; afterwards the judgment shall sit (Dan. 7:7-8, 11, 19-26). Here in the internal sense the perverted state of the church is treated of. The things which were here seen by 
Daniel, as the beast, the teeth of iron, the horn in which were eyes, and the horns that spoke, and those which made war with the saints, and that which spoke against the Most High, signify the state 
of falsity and of heresies within the church. That "horns" signify falsity powerful and prevailing, is evident from the mere fact that eyes are attributed to them, that is, understanding (n. 2701); 
and that they spoke, even against the Most High. By the "kingdoms" and "kings" are not signified kingdoms and kings, but doctrinal things of falsity; as may be seen from their signification in the Word 
as being doctrinal things of truth, and in the opposite sense of falsity (see n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 2547).  [14] Again in Daniel: </p>
<p>     A ram was seen by him standing before the river, which had two 
horns; and the horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing with his horn westward, and northward, and southward, so that no beasts could stand 
before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. As I was considering, behold a he-goat of the goats came from the west 
over the face of the whole earth; this he-goat had a horn between his two eyes; he came to the ram the lord of the horns, and ran upon him in the fury of his power, and smote him, and brake his two horns; 
and there was no power in the ram to stand before him. Afterwards the he-goat of the goats magnified himself exceedingly and when he was strong, his great horn was broken, and there came up four 
horns in place of it. Soon out of one of them went forth a little horn, and grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward beauty and it grew even to the army of the heavens, and 
some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the earth, and trampled upon them. The ram with the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia; the he-goat is the king of Greece; the four horns 
in place of one are four Kingdoms out of the nation (Dan. 8:1-27). Here in the spiritual sense the state of the spiritual church is treated of, which is the "ram" (n. 2830); and the state of that 
church is described, how it gradually declines and is perverted. The "he-goat of the goats" denotes those who are in faith separate from charity, or in truth separate from good, who begin to uplift themselves 
against good, and at length against the Lord. The "horns of the ram" are the truths of the spiritual church both internal and external; the "horns of the he-goat of the goats" are truths which 
have gradually degenerated into falsities; and by the "kingdoms" and "kings" here mentioned are not signified kingdoms and kings, but truths and falsities, as already said; for the Lord's Word in its 
essence does not treat of worldly and earthly, but of spiritual and heavenly things.  [15] In John: </p>
<p>     And there was seen another sign in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads, 
and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems; his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth (Rev. 12:3, 4). And again: </p>
<p>     I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, 
having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy. It was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. And then I saw another 
beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb (Rev. 13:1-2, 7, 11). Again in the same: </p>
<p>     I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy; having 
seven heads and ten horns; it was the great Babylon. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth; and they are seven kings; the ten horns are ten kings (Rev. 17:3, 5, 7, 9, 12-13). That 
by the "horns" here in like manner as in Daniel are signified the powers of falsity, is evident. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2832</b></p><p><b>2832.</b>
'By its horns' means with all its power as regards the truths of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'horns'. Horns are mentioned in various places in the Word, in which places they mean the power 
of truth which springs from good, and in the contrary sense the power of falsity which springs from evil. In this place the meaning is that those who are spiritual, meant by 'the ram', were entangled 
in natural knowledge with all their power as regards truth, and that as a consequence they were bereft of the power to perceive truths. For the more anyone relies on natural facts and keeps his mind 
(animus et mens) fixed on these where truths of faith are concerned, the more he loses the light of truth; and when he loses this light he loses the life of truth as well. Anyone may recognize this, 
if he stops to reflect, from his experience of people who say they are unable to believe anything unless they grasp that it is so through sensory evidence or through factual knowledge. If you probe into 
what they are really like you will discover that they believe nothing at all, and what is more that to them nothing seems wiser than to ascribe every single thing to natural forces. There are also 
many who say that they believe even though they do not apprehend. But secretly within themselves these reason no less than others from sensory evidence and factual knowledge regarding the truths of faith 
whether the thing is so. These either possess a kind of persuasive belief infused into them from self-love and love of the world, or else they do not have any belief at all. Their true nature is 
evident from their life. Both groups of people are indeed within the Lord's spiritual Church, yet they are not of the Church. They are of the Church however when the life of good is present in them and 
they have faith in truths. But spiritual people have faith in no other truths than those which have been impressed on them from early childhood and which after that they have confirmed for themselves 
from doctrine or some other source. Such is the state of those who are spiritual, a state which is described here by 'a ram caught in the thicket by its horns' - see immediately above in <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>. </p>

<p>Here 'our horn' and 'his horn' plainly stand for the power of truth. The subject is the Lord's spiritual kingdom. 'Our king belongs to the Holy

</blockquote>
<p>Divine truths, on account of their height, are called 'unicorn horns'. It is for this reason that mention is made so 
many times of a horn being exalted, for exaltation means power derived from what is interior. As regards what is internal being expressed as that which is high, see <a href="1735.htm">1735</a>, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>. </p>

<p>'Cutting down the whole horn of Israel' stands for deprivation of

<p>This refers to the Lord. 'Horns 
going out of His hand' and 'there the hiding-place of His strength will be', it is plain, stands for the power of truth. 'Mount Paran' is the Divine spiritual or Divine Truth of the Lord's Human - 
see <a href="2714.htm">2714</a> - which is also 'the brightness' and 'the light'. </p>

</blockquote>
For the altar was the chief representative of the Lord, 
and of worship of Him, see <a href="921.htm">921</a>. 'The alter' was a representative of His Divine Good, 'the horns' representatives of His Divine Truth. The derivation of truth from good was represented by the horns being 
protrusions from it, that is, from the altar. For the consideration that no other truth exists except that which is derived from good, see <a href="654.htm">654</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, <a href="1176.htm">1176</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2261.htm">2261</a>, <a href="2417.htm">2417</a>.

<p>Truths springing from good were meant, for all consecrations, inaugurations, and cleansings were

<blockquote>
The sixth angel sounded, and I heard 
a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which stood before God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%209:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 9: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The horns of the golden altar' plainly stands for truths that spring from good, for it was from the horns that 
the voice came. 'Gold' means good, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, and 'the golden altar' more especially so. </p>

 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
On the day I visit Israel for his transgressions, I will visit the altars of Bethel; 
and the horns of the altar will be cut away and fall to the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%203:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 3: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The horns of the altar will be cut away' meant that in that place the representation of truth springing from good 
would remain no longer. 'Bethel' is Divine good, and is therefore called 'the king's sanctuary' and 'a house of the kingdom' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%207:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 7: 13</a>.

as this, <a href="1782.htm">1782</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, which possesses power. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 A horn in the contrary sense means the power of falsity that springs from evil  </p>
<p>This is clear from the following places: In Amos, </p>
<p>O you who 
rejoice in a thing of nought, saying, Have we not by our own strength acquired horns for ourselves? Amos <a href="6.htm">6</a>. <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>'Home' here stands for the power of falsity. In Zechariah, </p>
<p>I lifted up my eyes and 
saw, and behold, four horns! And I said to the angel who talked to me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. And Jehovah showed me 
four smiths, and I said, What are these coming to do? And He said, These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man raised his head, and these have come to terrify, to cast down the horns 
of the nations lifting up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. Zech. 1: <a href="18.htm">18</a>-<a href="21.htm">21</a>. </p>
<p>'Horns' stands for the power of falsity that lays waste the Church. In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>You push with side 
and shoulder, and butt with your horns all the weak [sheep] until you have scattered them abroad. Ezek. 34: <a href="21.htm">21</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to shepherds who mislead by means of falsities. 'Horns' stands for the power 
of falsity, 'shoulder' for all the power they had, <a href="1085.htm">1085</a>. In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Jehovah has destroyed and not spared; and He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you. He has exalted the horn of your foes. 
Lam. 2: <a href="17.htm">17</a>. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>The horn of Moab has been cut off and his arm broken. Jer. 48: <a href="25.htm">25</a>. </p>
<p>'Horn' here stands for powerful falsity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>I said to the boastful, Do 
not boast; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn, do not lift up your horn on high, do not speak with a stiff neck. All the horns of the wicked I will cut away; the horns of the righteous will be 
exalted. Ps. 75: <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>'The horns of the wicked' stands for the power of falsity that springs from evil, 'the horns of the righteous' for the power of truth that springs from good. </p>

<p><b>[13]</b>
 In 
Daniel, </p>
<p>A fourth beast appeared, terrible and dreadful, exceedingly strong, which had iron teeth. It devoured, and broke in pieces, and trampled on the residue with its feet. It had ten horns. I was 
considering the horns, and behold, another little horn came up among them and three of the first horns were plucked up from before it. And behold, there were eyes in this horn like the eyes of a man 
(homo), and a mouth speaking great things. I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, and about the ten horns 
that were on its head, and about the other one that came up, and before which three of them fell, and about the same horn which had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things. As I looked this same horn 
made war with the saints, and prevailed over them until the Ancient of Days came and judgement was given to the saints. And he said, As for the fourth beast, it will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, 
which will be different from all the kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it in pieces. As for the ten horns, out of that same kingdom ten kings will arise, and 
another will arise after them, who will be different from the previous ones, and he will put down three kings. He will speak words against the Most High, and wear out the saints. After this the judgement 
will sit. Dan. 7: <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>, <a href="19.htm">19</a>-<a href="26.htm">26</a>. </p>
<p>This refers in the internal sense to the perverted state of the Church. The things mentioned here which Daniel saw- such as the beast, the iron teeth, the horn 
with eyes in it, and the horns that spoke; also the war these made with the saints, and [the king] speaking against the Most High - mean a state of falsity and of heresies inside the Church. For 'horns' 
means powerful and prevalent falsity, as may be seen merely from the consideration that 'eyes' - that is, the power of understanding, <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>- are attributed to them, and that they spoke even against 
the Most High. By 'kingdoms' and 'kings' are not meant kingdoms and kings but doctrines that teach what is false, as may be seen from the meaning of them in the Word as doctrines teaching what is true, 
and in the contrary sense doctrines teaching what is false, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 Elsewhere in Daniel when he saw a ram standing before the river, which had two horns, horns however 
which were high, yet one higher than the other, though the higher one had come up last, </p>
<p>I saw the ram butting<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> towards the west, and towards the north, and towards the south, so that no wild beast 
could stand before him, nor was there anyone to deliver out of his hand; therefore he did as he pleased and magnified himself. As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across the 
surface of the whole earth. This he-goat had a horn between his two eyes. He came to the two-horned ram<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> and ran at him in the fury of his might. He struck him and broke his two horns, and there 
was no strength in the ram to stand before him. After that the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns in its place. Shortly 
after, out of one of them there came forth a little horn, and it grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the glorious [land]. And it grew even towards the host of heaven, 
and cast down to earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them. The ram with the two horns is the kings of Media and Persia, the he-goat the king of Greece. The four horns in place 
of the one are four kingdoms from that nation. Dan. 8: <a href="1.htm">1</a>-end. </p>
<p>This refers in the internal sense to the state of the spiritual Church, meant by 'the ram', <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>; it describes how the state of that 
Church gradually deteriorated and was perverted. 'The he-goat' is those who have faith separated from charity, or truth separated from good, who start to raise themselves up against what is good and 
at length against the Lord. 'The horns of the ram' are the truths, internal and external, of the spiritual Church, 'the horns of the he-goat' truths which degenerate gradually into falsities. By 'kingdoms' 
and 'kings' here are not meant kingdoms and kings but truths and falsities, as stated just above. For essentially the Word of the Lord does not have to do with worldly and earthly matters but with 
spiritual and celestial. </p>

<p><b>[15]</b>
 In John, </p>
<p>Another sign appeared in heaven, for behold, a great fiery-red dragon having seven heads, and ten horns, and on his heads seven jewels. With his tail he 
drew a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them down to the earth. Rev. 12: <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="4.htm">4</a>. </p>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<p>I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, which had seven heads, and ten 
horns, and on its horns ten jewels, and on its heads a blasphemous name. It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, which had two 
horns like a lamb. Rev. 13: <a href="1.htm">1</a>, <a href="2.htm">2</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>. </p>
<p>Yet again in the same book, </p>
<p>I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names. It had seven heads and ten horns. She was Babylon the 
great. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated, and they are seven kings. The ten horns are ten kings. Rev. 17: <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>, <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>Here as in Daniel 'horns' clearly means 
the powers of falsity.

`Cornibus suis': quod significet omni potentia quoad vera fidei, constat a significatione `cornuum'; cornua in Verbo passim memorantur, et ibi significant potentiam veri quod ex bono, et in opposito

pro quod robur in scientiis et cognitionibus veri; quod `manus' et `dextra' sit robur, n. 878, et quod {5}`mare et fluvii' sint scientiae et cognitiones, n. 28, 2702: apud eundem,           Amabo

27, 30, 34; ut       et cum altare expiaretur, Lev. xvi 18, 19; </p>
<p>significabant vera ex bono; omnes enim sanctificationes, inaugurationes et expiationes fiebant per vera, quia vera introducunt ad bonum, 
n. 2830; quod `cornua altaris' significaverint vera quae ex bono, constare etiam potest apud Johannem,           Sextus angelus clanxit, tunc audivi vocem unam ex       quatuor cornibus altaris 
aurei, quod coram Deo, Apoc. ix 13; </p>
<p>cornua altaris aurei' manifeste pro veris ex bono, nam inde vox; </p>
<p>quod `aurum' sit bonum, n. 113, 1551, 1552, magis adhuc `altare aureum': [10] apud Amos,       
    In die visitavero praevaricationes Israelis super       illum, visitabo super altaria Bethelis, et exscindentur cornua      altaris, et cadent in terram, iii 14; </p>
<p>`cornua altaris quod exscindentur' 
erat quod ibi non repraesentaretur amplius verum ex bono; `Bethel' est bonum Divinum, vocatur ideo `sanctuarium regis,' et `domus regni,' Amos vii 13.  Quod reges ungerentur oleo ex cornu, I Sam. 
xvi 2, 13; I Reg. i 39, repraesentabat similiter ex bono verum; `oleum' erat bonum n. 886, `cornu' autem verum, ipsum regium in sensu interno est tale verum, n. 1728, 2015, {11}cui potentia.  [11] Quod 
cornu in opposito sensu significet potentiam falsi  quod ex malo, constat a sequentibus locis; apud Amos,           O laetantes ad non quicquam, dicentes, Annon in robore      nostro accepimus nobis 
cornua? vi 13; </p>
<p>`cornua' ibi pro potentia falsi: apud Zachariam,           Sustuli oculos meos, et vidi, et ecce quatuor cornua,       et dixi ad angelum loquentem in me, Quid haec? et dixit ad me,  
    Haec cornua quae disperserunt Jehudam, Israelem et      Hierosolymam; et ostendit mihi Jehovah quatuor fabros, et      dixi, Quid hi venientes ad faciendum? et dixit dicendo, Haec      cornua 
quae disperserunt Jehudam, adeo ut vir non tollat caput      suum, et venerunt hi ad terrendum, ad dejiciendum cornua      gentium, attollentium cornu ad terram Jehudae, ad dispergendum      eam, 
ii 1-4 [A.V. i 18-21]; </p>
<p>`cornua'  pro potentia falsi {12}quod vastat Ecclesiam: apud Ezechielem,            Latere et humero impellitis, et cornibus vestris      feritis omnes infirmas, usque dum 
disperseritis eas foras,      xxxiv 21: </p>
<p>ibi de pastoribus, qui per falsa seducunt, `cornua' pro potentia falsi: `humerus' pro omni potentia, n. 1085: apud Jeremiam,           Jehovah destruxit, et 
non pepercit, et laetificavit       super te hostem, exaltavit cornu inimicorum tuorum, Thren. ii      17: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Excisum est cornu Moabi, et brachium ejus confractum       est, 
Jer. xlviii 25; </p>
<p>`cornu' ibi pro potente falso: [12] apud Davidem,           Dixi gloriantibus, Ne gloriemini; et impiis, Ne      attollatis cornu, ne attollatis in altum cornu vestrum, ne      loquamini 
collo duro,...omnia cornua impiorum exscindam,      exaltabuntur cornua justi, Ps. lxxv 5, 6, 11 [A.V. 4, 5, 10]; </p>
<p>`cornua impiorum' pro potentia falsi ex malo, `cornua justi' pro potentia veri 
ex bono: [13] apud Danielem,           Vsa bestia quarta, terribilis et formidabilis, robusta      valde, cui dentes ferri, comedit et contrivit, et reliquum      pedibus conculcavit;...erant decem 
cornua illi: attendens fui      ad cornua. et ecce cornu aliud parvum ascendit inter ea, et      tria de cornibus prioribus eradicata sunt a coram eo, et ecce      oculi sicut oculi hominis in cornu 
hoc, et os loquens      magna:...videns fui tunc propter vocem verborum magnorum, quae      cornu loquens.... Cupivi certitudinem de bestia quarta,...et      de cornibus decem quae in capite ejus, 
et de alio quod      ascendit, et caderent a coram eo tria: et de cornu eodem, quod      oculi ei, et os loquens magna:... videns fui, quod cornu idem      faceret bellum cum sanctis; et praevaleret 
eis, usque dum      venit Antiquus dierum et judicatum datum sanctis; et dixit,      quod ad bestiam quartam, regnum quartum erit in terra, quod      diversum erit ab omnibus regnis, et comedet 
omnem terram, et      conculcabit eam, et conteret eam; quod at cornua decem, ex      eodem regno decem reges surgent, et alius surget post eos, qui      diversus erit a prioribus, et tres reges 
humiliabit, verba      contra Altissimum loquetur, et sanctos atteret, ...post      judicium sedebit, vii 7, 8, 11, 19-25 [26]; </p>
<p>agitur ibi in sensu interno de statu Ecclesiae perverso; quae ibi visa 
sunt Danieli, ut `bestia, dentes ferri, cornu in quo oculi, et cornua loquentia,' et quae `bellum facerent cum sanctis,' et quod `loqueretur contra Altissimum' significant statum falsi et haeresium 
intra Ecclesiam quod `cornua' falsum potens et praevalens significent, constare potes solum ex eo quod eis tribuantur `oculi', hoc est, intellectuale, n. 2701 et quod {13}`locuta etiam contra Altissimum'; 
per `regna et reges' non {14}significantur regna et reges, sed doctrinalia falsi, ut constare potest ab eorum significatione in Verbo, quod sint doctrinalia veri, et in opposito sensu doctrinalia 
falsi, videatur n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 2547: [14] alibi apud Danielem,            Visus ei aries stans ante flumen, cui duo cornua,       cornua autem alta, unum tamen altum prae altero, sed altum  
    ascenderat posterius; vidi arietem cornu ferientem versus      occidentem, et versus septentrionem, et versus meridiem, ita      ut omnes ferae non consisterent coram eo, nec liberans e manu  
    ejus, unde fecit secundum placitum, et magnum se faciebat.       Cum essem attentus, ecce hircus caprarum venit ab occidente      super facies omnis terrae;...huic hirco cornu inter duos      
oculos, venit ad arietem dominum cornuum,...et cucurrit ad eum      furore roboris sui,...percussit eum, et fregit duo cornua      ejus, nec erant vires in ariete consistendi coram eo:...postea    
  hircus caprarum magnum se fecit valde, sed cum invaluit,      fractum est cornu magnum, et   ascenderunt quatuor cornua loco      ejus mox ex uno de illis exivit cornu unum de exiguo, et      crevit 
valde versus meridiem, et versus ortum, et versus      decus, et crevit ad exercitum caelorum, et dejecit in terram      de exercitu, et de stellis, et conculcavit eas.... Aries cum      duobus 
cornibus sunt reges Mediae et Persiae, hircus rex      Graeciae,...quatuor cornua loco unius, sunt quatuor regna ex      gente, viii I-fin. ibi agitur in sensu interno de statu Ecclesiae spiritualis 
quae est `aries,' n. 2830, et describitur status illius ecclesiae, quomodo successive declinat et pervertitur; `hircus caprarum' sunt illi qui in fide separata a charitate, seu in vero separato a bono, 
sunt qui incipiunt se efferre contra bonum, tandem contra Dominum; `cornua arietis' sunt vera Ecclesiae spiritualis interna et externa; `cornua hirci caprarum' sunt vera, quae degenerantur successive 
in falsa; per `regna et reges' ibi nec significantur regna et reges, sed vera et falsa, ut modo dictum; Verbum enim Domini in sua essentia non agit de mundanis et terrestribus, sed de spiritualibus 
et caelestibus: [15] apud Johannem,           Visum est aliud signum in caelo, ecce enim draco magnus      rufus, habens capita septem, et cornua decem, et super      capitibus diademata septem, 
cauda ejus traxit tertiam partem      stellarum caeli, et projecit eas in terram, Apoc. xii 3, 4: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Vidi ex mari bestiam ascendentem, quae habebat capita       septem, et cornua 
decem, et super cornibus suis decem      diademata, super capitibus suis nomen blasphemiae;...datum est      illi bellum facere cum sanctis, et vincere eos.... Deinde vidi      aliam bestiam ascendentem 
e terra, quae habebat cornua duo      similia agno, Apoc. xiii 1, 2, 7, 11: </p>
<p>iterum apud eundem,           Vidi mulierem sedentem super bestia coccinea plenam nominibus blasphemiae, et habebat 
capita septem, et cornua decem;... erat Babylon magna;...septem capita sunt montes septem, ubi mulier sedet super illis, et reges septem sunt;...decem cornua decem reges sunt, Apoc. xvii 3, 5, 7, 
9, [10], 12, 13; quod hic per `cornua,' similiter ac apud Danielem, significentur potentiae falsi, constare potest. @1 sed usque credere eorum est persuasivum insufflatum ex ambitu honoris, aut 
ex cupiditate lucri, tales etiam apud se in occulto aeque ac alii ex sensualibus et scientificis ratiocinantur de veris fidei num ita sit, et partim persuasivum suum sic confirmant, et partim non credunt, 
et quod non credant, patet a vita, illi et hi quidem sunt in Ecclesia Domini spirituali, sed non ab Ecclesia, qui ab Ecclesia sunt, in vita boni sunt, et fidem veris habent, sed non aliis veris, 
quam quae impressa sibi habent ab infantia, et confirmata sibi ex doctrina aut aliunde, non aliunde scientes num vera sint, et hoc quoque ex causa, quia usque implicati sunt scientifico naturali 
et sic deprivati potentia percipiendi num verum sit, hoc illi ignorant, fortasse etiam ideo negant, talis status est spiritualium, qui status hic descriptus est per arietem detentum in perplexo 
cornibus suis, inde est, quod spiritualibus sit obscurum respective, n. 1043, 2708 pr. 2715, 2718, et quod spirituales absque adventu Domini in mundum, non salvari potuerint, n. 2661, 2716, et quod
