Verses 17-23. And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The word that thou doest is not good. Wearing thou wilt wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee, because the word is too heavy for 
thee; thou art not able to do it, thou alone. Now hear my voice, I will counsel thee, and God shall be with thee. Be thou for the people with God, and bring thou the words unto God; and do thou teach 
them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. And do thou see out of all the people men of strenuousness, fearing God, men of 
truth, hating gain; and do thou set them for princes of thousands, princes of hundreds, princes fifties, and princes of tens; and let them judge the people in every time; and it shall be, every great 
word let them bring unto thee, and every small word let them judge; and devolve from upon thee, and let them bear with thee. If thou do this word, and God have commanded thee, then thou shalt be able 
to stand, and also all this people shall come upon its place in peace. "And Moses' father-in-law said unto him," signifies foresight; "The word that thou doest is not good," signifies that a change must 
be made; "wearing thou wilt wear way, both thou, and this people that is with thee," signifies that thus the truth which has been implanted would perish; "because the word is too heavy for thee," 
signifies that it is not possible because not in conformity with order; "thou art not able to do it, thou alone," signifies without the influx of truth from the Divine from some other source; "now hear 
my voice," signifies agreement from the union; "I will counsel thee, and God shall be with thee," signifies that it is from the Divine; "be thou for the people with God," signifies the truth proceeding 
immediately from the Lord; "and bring thou the words unto God," signifies mediation and intercession; "and do thou teach them the statutes and the laws," signifies that from truth immediately from 
the Lord come the external and internal goods and truths of the church; "and make known to them the way wherein they must walk," signifies the light of intelligence and the consequent life; "and the 
work that they must do," signifies faith in act; "and do thou see out of all the people," signifies the choosing of ministering truths; "men of strenuousness, fearing God," signifies with which good from 
the Divine could be conjoined; "men of truth, hating gain," signifies with which the truths are pure without a worldly end; "and do thou set them for princes of thousands," signifies primary truths 
which are in the first degree under the truth immediately from the Divine; "princes of hundreds," signifies primary truths in the second degree; "princes of fifties," signifies intermediate primary 
truths; "and princes of tens," signifies primary truths in the third place; "and let them judge the people in every time," signifies a disposing In this manner perpetually; "and it shall be, every great 
word let them bring unto thee," signifies that everything is from the truth that is immediately from the Divine; "and every small word let them judge," signifies the appearance of some singular and 
particular things as from another source; "and devolve from upon thee, and let them bear with thee," signifies thus functions and offices for them; "if thou do this word, and God have commanded thee," 
signifies that thus it is from the Divine; "then thou shalt be able to stand," signifies thus an abode with them; "and also all this people shall come upon its place in peace," signifies that they who 
are of the spiritual church shall thus be in good, and shall be led by means of good. </p>

Verses 17-23 And the father-in-law of Moses said to him, The thing that you do is not good. You will surely wither away, both you and this people who are with you, for the task<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is too heavy for you; 
you are not able to do it yourself alone. Now hear my voice; I will counsel you, and God will be with you. Be for the people with God, and you are to bring matters to God.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And you are to teach them 
the statutes and the laws, [and] make known to them the way in which they must go, and the work they must do. And you are to see<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> out of all the people men of vigour fearing God, men of truth hating 
gain; and you are to appoint them rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And let them judge the people at all times. And it shall be, every great matter let 
them bring to you, and every small matter let them judge themselves; and roll down [the burden] from upon yourself, and let them bear [it] with you. If you do this thing and God has commanded you, you 
will be able to stand fast; and also all this people will come upon their place in peace. </p>
<p>'And the father-in-law of Moses said to him' means foresight. 'The thing that you do is not good' means that 
a change must take place. 'You will surely wither away, both you and this people who are with you' means that if it carries on as before the truth which has been implanted is going to perish. 'For 
the task is too heavy for you' means that it is not possible because it does not arise from true order. 'You are not able to do it yourself alone' means without any truth from good flowing in from another 
source. 'Now hear my voice' means agreement as a result of union. 'I will counsel you, and God will be with you' means that it comes from the Divine. 'Be for the people with God' means truth coming 
forth directly from the Lord. 'And you are to bring matters to God' means mediation and intercession. 'And you are to teach them the statutes and the laws' means that truth coming directly from the 
Lord is the source of external and internal aspects of goodness and truth in the Church. 'And make known to them the way in which they must go' means the light of intelligence and the life led as a result 
of it. 'And the work they must do' means faith put into action. 'And you are to see out of all the people' means the choice of subservient truths. 'Men of vigour fearing God' means to which the 
good from God can be joined. 'Men of truth hating gain' means because<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> the truths are pure, devoid of any worldly end in view. 'And you are to appoint from them rulers of thousands' means first and 
foremost truths in the first degree below truth coming directly from God. 'Rulers of hundreds' means first and foremost truths in the second degree. 'Rulers of fifties' means first and foremost truths 
that are intermediary. 'And rulers of tens' means first and foremost truths in third place. 'And let them judge the people at all times' means arrangement in this order perpetually. 'And it shall be, 
every great matter let them bring to you' means that everything exists from the truth going forth directly from God. 'And every small matter let them judge themselves' means the appearance that some 
particular and specific things derive from another source. 'And roll down [the burden] from upon yourself, and let them bear [it] with you' means thus assigning them functions and duties. 'If you do 
this thing and God has commanded you' means since it is so ordained by God ... 'You will be able to stand fast' means, it accordingly has a dwelling place with them. 'And also all this people will come 
upon their place in peace' means that those belonging to the spiritual Church will thus be governed by good and led by good.

Vers. 17-23.  Et dixit socer Moschis ad illum, Non bonum verbum quod tu facis.  Marcescendo marcesces etiam tu etiam populus hic qui tecum, quia grave prae te verbum; non potes facere illud solus tu. 
 Nunc audi vocem meam, consulam tibi, et erit Deus tecum; esto tu populo apud Deum, et adducas tu verba ad Deum.  Et doceas illos statuta et leges, [et] notam facias illis viam ibunt in qua, et opus 
quod facient.  Et tu videas ex omni populo viros strenuitatis timentes Deum, viros veritatis odientes lucrum; et ponas {1}illos principes millenorum, principes centenorum, principes quinquagenorum, et 
principes decadum.  Et judicent populum in omni tempore, et erit, omne verbum magnum adducant ad te, et omne verbum parvum judicent illi; et devolve desuper te, et portent tecum.  Si verbum hoc facias, 
et praeceperit tibi Deus, et potes consistere; et etiam omnis populus hic super locum suum veniet in pace.  `Et dixit socer Moschis ad illum' significat praevidentiam: `Non bonum verbum quod tu facis'

opus quod facient' significat fidem actu: `et tu videas ex omni populo' significat electionem verorum inservientium: `viros strenuitatis timentes Deum' significat quibus bonum a Divino conjungi {3}potest: 
`viros veritatis odientes lucrum' significat {4}quibus vera sunt pura absque (x)fine mundano: `et ponas {5}illos principes millenorum' significat primaria quae in primo gradu sub vero immediato

populum in omni tempore' (x)significat dispositionem sic in perpetuum: `et erit, omne verbum magnum adducant ad te' significat quod omne a vero immediate a Divino: `et omne verbum parvum judicent illi'
