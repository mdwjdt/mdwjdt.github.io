<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1697.</strong>创世记14:12. 又掳去亚伯兰的侄儿罗得和罗得的财物，离开了。当时罗得正住在所多玛。<br />“又掳去亚伯兰的侄儿罗得和罗得的财物，离开了”表表面的良善与真理本身并非良善与真理，它们占据了外在人和那里的一切。“当时罗得正住在所多玛”表外在人的状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1697.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1697/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_12" target=_top>Genesis 14:12</a>. And they took Lot and his property — the son of Abram's brother — and went away; and he had been living in Sodom.<br />They took Lot and his property — the son of Abram's brother — and went away means that apparent goodness and truth (not good or true in itself) seized control of the Lord's outer self and everything in it. And he had been living in Sodom means the condition of [his outer self]. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1697</b></p><p><b>1697.</b>
Verse 12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his substance, and departed; and he was dwelling in Sodom. "They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his substance, and departed," signifies that 
the apparent goods and truths, which in themselves are not goods and truths, took possession of the external man, and of all things therein; "and he was dwelling in Sodom," signifies the state of 
the external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1697</b></p><p><b>1697.</b>
Verse 12 And they took Lot and his acquisitions, Abram's brother's son, and went their way; and he was dwelling in Sodom. </p>
<p>'They took Lot and his acquisitions, Abram's brother's son, and went their 
way' means that apparent goods and truths, which are not in themselves goods and truths, took possession of the External Man and everything there. 'And he was dwelling in Sodom' means the state of that 
[External] Man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1697</b>
</p><b>1697.</b>
Vers. 12.  Et sumpserunt Lotum, et acquisitionem ejus, filium fratris Abrami, et abiverunt; et is habitans in Sodoma. 'Sumpserunt Lotum, et acquisitionem ejus, filium fratris Abrami, et abiverunt' significat 
quod bona et vera apparentia, quae in se non bona et vera sunt, occupaverint Externum Hominem, et omnia quae ibi essent: 'et is habitans in Sodoma' significat statum illius. </p>
