<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6828节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6828.</strong>“他领羊群到旷野的后面”表他们，即那些处于简单良善的真理之人经历试探之后。这从“羊群”和“旷野”的含义清楚可知：“羊群”是指那些处于简单良善的真理之人所在的教会，如刚才所述（<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>节）；“旷野”是指试探的状态。因为“旷野”是指很少有人居住和耕种的地方，以及完全无人居住和耕种的地方，因而在灵义上是指在良善上经历荒废、在真理上经历荒凉的人，因此是指经历试探的人；因为经历试探的人经历荒废和荒凉。他里面的虚假和邪恶会跳出来，遮挡，甚至几乎除去来自主的真理与良善的流注；在他看来，所流入的真理似乎没有足够的生命能驱散虚假和邪恶。此外，这时恶灵会出现，注入一种痛苦，使他对得救感到绝望。“旷野”就表示这种状态，这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来（参看<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>节）；由于“旷野”表示一种试探的状态，数字“四十”表示试探持续的时间，无论长短（<a href="730.htm">730</a>，<a href="862.htm">862</a>，<a href="2272.htm">2272</a>，<a href="2273.htm">2273</a>节），所以以色列人在旷野四十年；主也因此在旷野受试探四十天（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.2.htm">4:2</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">1:13</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6828</b></p><p><b>6828.</b>
And he led the flock behind the wilderness. That this signifies after they had undergone temptations, namely, they who were in the truth of simple good, is evident from the signification of a "flock," 
as being the church where they are who are in the truth of simple good (of which just above, n. 6827); and from the signification of "wilderness," as being a state of temptation. For a "wilderness" 
signifies what is but little inhabited and cultivated, and also what is not inhabited and cultivated at all, thus in the spiritual sense a man vastated as to good and desolated as to truth, consequently 
a man who is in temptation; for he who is in temptation is in vastation and in desolation, because the falsity and evil in him come out and darken and almost take away the influx of truth and good 
from the Lord; and the truth which flows in does not appear to him to have sufficient life to disperse the falsities and evils. Moreover, evil spirits are then present, who inject grief, and despair of 
salvation. That a "wilderness" signifies such a state, is evident from very many passages in the Word (see n. 2708); and as a "wilderness" signified a state of temptation, and the number "forty" its 
duration, however long or short (n. 730, 862, 2272, 2273), therefore the sons of Israel were in the wilderness forty years; and therefore the Lord was in the wilderness forty days when He was tempted 
(Matt. 4:2; Mark 1:13). </p>

'And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness' means after the temptations they - those guided by the truth that went with simple good - had undergone. This is clear from the meaning of 'the flock' 
as the Church where those who were guided by the truth that went with simple good were, dealt with immediately above in <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>; and from the meaning of 'the wilderness' as a state of temptation. 'A 
wilderness' can mean that which is sparsely inhabited and cultivated or else that which is totally uninhabited and uncultivated, and so in the spiritual sense means a person who has experienced vastation 
as regards good and desolation as regards truth. It therefore means a person undergoing temptation, for a person undergoing temptation experiences vastation and desolation. The falsity and evil present 
in him come out into the open, blotting out and virtually removing the influx of truth and good from the Lord. And the truth that does flow in does not seem to that person to possess the kind of 
life that can dispel falsities and evils. Furthermore evil spirits are present at this time, injecting a feeling of distress and making him despair of salvation. The fact that 'a wilderness' means a 
state such as this is clear from very many places in the Word, see <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>; and since 'the wilderness' meant a state of temptation, and the number 'forty' meant its duration, of whatever length, <a href="730.htm">730</a>, <a href="862.htm">862</a>, <a href="2272.htm">2272</a>, <a href="1273.htm">1273</a>, the children of Israel were for that reason in the wilderness forty years, and the Lord was for the same reason in the wilderness forty days when He was tempted, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1:13</a>. </p>

</p><b>6828.</b>
`Et duxit gregem post desertum': quod significet postquam tentationes subierunt, nempe illi qui in vero simplicis boni, constat ex significatione `gregis' quod sit Ecclesia ubi illi qui in vero simplicis 
boni, de qua mox supra n. 6827; et ex significatione `deserti' quod sit status tentationis; `desertum' enim significat parum habitatum et excultum, et quoque prorsus non habitatum et excultum, ita 
in sensu spirituali hominem vastatum quoad bonum et desolatum quoad verum, proinde hominem qui in tentatione est; qui enim in tentatione est in vastatione est et in desolatione; falsum enim et malum 
quae apud illum, emergunt, (c)ac obscurant et paene auferunt influxum veri et boni a Domino; verum quod influit nec apparet ei {1} talem vitam habere ut falsa et mala discutiat; {2}adsunt etiam tunc 
spiritus mali, qui dolorem inferunt, et desperationem de salute.  Quod `desertum' talem statum significet, constat ex plurimis locis in Verbo, videatur n. 2708; et quia `desertum' significabat statum 
tentationis, et numerus `quadraginta' (m)durationem ejus quamcumque, n. 730, 862, 2272, 2273;(n) idcirco filii Israelis erant in deserto quadraginta annis {3}; et idcirco {4} Dominus fuit in deserto 
quadraginta diebus cum tentatus, Matth. (x)iv 2; Marc. i 13. 	@1 i non$ 	@2 inde ei desperatio de salute et dolor$ 	@3 i et ibi in tentatione$ 	@4 i etiam$ </p>
