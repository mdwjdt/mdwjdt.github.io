<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（一）经文</h4><br />（1）神赐福给挪亚和他的儿子，对他们说：“你们要繁殖增多，遍满这地。<br />（2）地上的一切牲畜和空中的一切飞鸟，都必惊恐、惧怕你们；连土地上爬出的一切并海里一切的鱼，它们都要交在你们手里。<br />（3）凡活着的一切爬物，都可以作你们的食物；这一切我都赐给你们，如同可食的植物一样。<br />（4）惟独带灵魂的肉，就是带血的肉，你们却不可吃。<br />（5）我必追讨你们的血和灵魂；我要向一切野兽追讨它，向人和人的兄弟追讨人的灵魂。<br />（6）凡流人里面的人血的，他的血也必会流，因为神造人，是照自己的形像造的。<br />（7）你们要繁殖增多；要在地上滋生、增多<br />（8）神对挪亚和同他一起的儿子说话，说，<br />（9）看哪，我要与你们和你们以后的种立我的约，<br />（10）并与同你们一起的一切活的灵魂，就是飞鸟、牲畜、与你们在一起的地上一切野兽；凡从方舟里出来的，甚至地上一切野兽立约。<br />（11）我要与你们立我的约，凡有血肉的，不再被诸水的泛滥剪除，也不再有洪水毁坏地了。<br />（12）神说，这是立约的记号，是我在我与你们之间所立的，并与同你们一起的一切活的灵魂直到万代之间所立的。<br />（13）我把我的彩虹放在云彩中，这就可作我与地立约的记号了。<br />（14）我使云彩遮盖地的时候，必有彩虹现在云彩中，<br />（15）我便记念在我与你们并凡有血肉的一切活的灵魂之间所立的约，诸水就不会再成为洪水，毁灭一切有血肉的了。<br />（16）彩虹必现在云彩中，我看见它，就要记念神与地上一切有血肉的活的灵魂所立的永约。<br />（17）神对挪亚说，这是立约的记号，是我在我与地上一切有血肉的之间所立的。<br />（18）出方舟的挪亚的儿子就是闪、含、雅弗。含是迦南的父亲。<br />（19）这三个是挪亚的儿子，全地从他们铺张开来。<br />（20）挪亚开始作起土地上的人来，栽了一个葡萄园。<br />（21）他喝了酒，喝醉了，在帐棚中间赤着身子。<br />（22）迦南的父亲含，看见他父亲赤身，就告诉他外边的两个兄弟。<br />（23）于是闪和雅弗拿件衣服，搭在两人的肩上，倒退着进去，遮盖父亲的赤身；他们背着脸，就看不见父亲的赤身。<br />（24）挪亚醒了酒，知道他小儿子向他所作的事，<br />（25）就说，迦南当受咒诅，必给他兄弟作奴隶的奴隶。<br />（26）又说，耶和华，闪的神是赐福的，迦南要作他的奴隶。<br />（27）愿神使雅弗扩张，他要住在闪的帐棚里；迦南要作他的奴隶。<br />（28）洪水以后，挪亚又活了三百五十年。<br />（29）挪亚所有的日子是九百五十年；他死了。<br /><h4 align="center">（二）概览</h4><br /><strong>971.</strong>接下来的主题是重生之人的状态，首先论述的是内在人的主宰和外在人的顺从。</p>

And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Reproduce and multiply and fill the earth.{*1} 2. And may fear of you and terror of you be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky. As for everything that the ground causes to creep out, and as for all the fish of the sea — into your hands let them be given.<br />3. Every creeping thing that is alive will serve you for food. I have given it all to you as I gave you the green plants.<br />4. Only flesh in its soul [you must not eat], its blood you must not eat.<br />5. And assuredly the blood of your souls I will seek; at the hand of every wild animal I will seek it, and at the hand of a human — at the hand of a man, [the victim's] brother{*2} — I will seek that person's soul.<br />6. Those shedding the blood of a person in a person will have their own blood shed, because [blood] has made humankind into God's image.<br />7. And you, reproduce and multiply; pour out into the earth and multiply on it."<br />8. And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,{*3} 9. And I — yes, I — am setting up my pact with you and with your seed after you,<br />10. and with every living soul that is with you: bird, beast, and every wild animal of the earth with you, from among all those coming out of the ark, including every wild animal of the earth.<br />11. And I am setting up my pact with you; and no more will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and no more will there be a flood to destroy the earth."<br />12. And God said, "This is the sign of the pact that I make between me and you and every living soul that is with you, to everlasting generations:<br />13. My bow I have put in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the pact between me and the earth.<br />14. And it will happen in my clouding the earth over with cloud that a bow will be seen in the cloud,<br />15. and I will remember my pact, which is between me and you and every living soul within all flesh. And no more will there be water as a flood to destroy all flesh.<br />16. And there will be a bow in the cloud; and I will see it, to remember the eternal pact between God and every living soul within all flesh that is on the earth."<br />17. And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the pact that I am setting up between me and all flesh that is on the earth."<br />18. And the sons of Noah coming out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.<br />19. These three were Noah's sons; and from them the whole earth scattered out.<br />20. And Noah started as a man of the soil and planted a vineyard.<br />21. And he drank some wine and became drunk and was uncovered in the middle of his tent.<br />22. And Ham, father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and pointed it out to his two brothers outside.<br />23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and both of them put it on their shoulder and went backward and covered their father's nakedness; and their faces were backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.<br />24. And Noah woke up from his wine and realized what his younger son had done to him.<br />25. And he said, "A curse on Canaan! A slave of slaves he will be to his brothers."<br />26. And he said, "A blessing on Jehovah,{*4} God of Shem! And Canaan will be slave to him.<br />27. May God broaden Japheth! And he will live in Shem's tents, and Canaan will be slave to him."<br />28. And Noah lived after the flood for three hundred fifty years.<br />29. And all Noah's days were nine hundred fifty years; and he died.<br />971. Summary<br />NEXT to be treated of is the condition of a person reborn — first the mastery exerted by the inner self and the obedience of the outer self.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_1" target=_top>Genesis 9:1</a>). On Swedenborg's translations of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5" target=_top>5</a>. [Editors]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_5" target=_top>Genesis 9:5</a>). The Latin here translated "at the hand of a man, [the victim's] brother" (e manu viri fratris ejus) is a literal translation of the Hebrew (מִיַּד‭ ‬אִישׁ‭ ‬אָחִיו [mîyyaḏ 'îš 'āḥîv]). The Hebrew expresses the idea that vengeance for murder will be taken on the murderer, who is a fellow human being to the one murdered. The masculinity of the persons mentioned is important to the meaning given in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007" target=_top>1007</a>. [LHC]<br />{*3} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_8" target=_top>Genesis 9:8</a>). The repetition of the verb "to say" here in the phrase "God said to Noah ... saying" reflects a similar repetition in the Latin original and the Hebrew that it translates. Such repetition is typical of the Hebrew Scriptures and Swedenborg's renderings of them — see, for example, the three somewhat overlapping occurrences of "cloud" as a noun or a verb in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_14" target=_top>14</a> just below.

On Jehovah as a name for God, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>.
