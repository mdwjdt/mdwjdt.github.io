<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5182节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5182.</strong>有些螺旋运动是新来的灵人必须被引入其中的，好叫他们能与其他灵人同住，与他们和谐一致地交谈和思考。在来世，所有人都必须彼此和谐一致地共存，好叫他们能成为一个统一的整体，就像人里面的所有个体部位一样；这些个体部位虽处处不同，却彼此和谐一致，从而构成一个统一的整体。这同样适用于大人；为达到这一目的，一个人的思维和言语必须与其他人的相一致。在一个社群中，每个成员的思维和言语都要与其他人和谐一致，这是绝对必要的，或说是基本要求；否则，就会出现不和谐，这种不和谐在其他人心里听上去就像一种尖锐的刺耳声。此外，凡不和谐的东西都会破坏统一，是一种必须被剔除的瑕疵。与血液共存并在血液中、必须被清除的杂质就代表由不和谐所造成的这种瑕疵。这种杂质的清除通过搅动实现，搅动无非是各种试探；后来这种清除则通过引入螺旋运动实现。第一次引入螺旋运动的目的是叫灵人们互相适应；第二次引入的目的是叫他们的思维与言语能够一致；第三次引入的目的是叫他们在思维和情感上都能彼此一致；第四次引入的目的是叫他们能在真理与良善上达成一致。</p>

There are circles into which recent spirits have to be inaugurated in order that they may be able to be in the companionship of others, and both speak and think together with them. In the other life 
there must be a concord and unanimity of all, in order that they may be a one; just as is the case with each and all things in man, which though everywhere various, yet by being of one accord make a one. 
It is similar in the Grand Man; and to this end the thought and speech of one must be in accord with those of others. It is a fundamental necessity that the thought and speech should accord together 
in every individual in a society; otherwise a discordance like a disagreeable grating noise is perceived, which strikes harshly on the minds of the others. Moreover, everything discordant tends to 
disunite, and is impure, and must be rejected. This impurity arising from discord is represented by the impurity with and in the blood, from which it needs to be cleansed. This cleansing is effected by 
means of agitations, which are nothing else than temptations of various kinds; and afterward by means of introduction into circles. The first introduction into circles takes place in order that the 
spirits may be accommodated together; the second is in order that the thought and speech may be in accord; the third is that the spirits may agree together as to thoughts and affections; and the fourth 
is that they may agree in truths and goods. </p>

There are spirallings into which spirits who are recent arrivals in the next life have to be introduced, for the purpose of enabling them to live in the company of other spirits and of enabling them 
both to speak and to think in unison with these. In the next life all must exist in accord and harmony with one another if they are to be a unified whole, even as all the individual parts of the human 
being, which are varied throughout the body, are nevertheless in harmony with one another and so make a unified whole. The same applies to the Grand Man, in which one person's thought and speech must 
accord with the thought and speech of all the others if they are to achieve the same end. It is absolutely essential that the thought and speech of each member in a community should accord with the rest, 
otherwise discord is detected, which sounds in the minds of the others like a harsh grating noise. Furthermore everything discordant is destructive of unity; it is an imperfection that must be cast 
out. This imperfection resulting from discord is represented by impurity residing with and present within the blood, from which it must be expelled. The expulsion of this impurity is effected by harrying 
processes, which are nothing else than various kinds of temptations, and after this by means of introductions into spirallings. The purpose of a first introduction into spirallings is to enable 
spirits to become adjusted to one another; the purpose of a second is that their thought may accord with their speech; the purpose of a third is that they may all agree with one another in thought and 
affection; and the purpose of a fourth is that they may agree in truth and good. </p>

</p><b>5182.</b>
Sunt gyri in quos spiritus recentes inaugurari debent, ob causam ut interesse queant aliorum consortiis, et cum illis simul et loqui et cogitare, omnium concordia et unanimitas erit in altera vita 
ut unum sint, sicut omnia et singula in homine, quae tametsi varia sunt ubivis, usque tamen per unanimum faciunt unum, similiter in Maximo Homine, ob illum finem concordabit unius cogitatio et loquela 
cum aliorum; fundamentale {1} est ut cogitatio et loquela {2}in se apud unumquemvis in societate concordet, alioquin appercipitur discors sicut molestus stridor, qui mentes aliorum ferit; omne 
etiam discors est disuniens, et est impurum, quod rejiciendum; hoc impurum ex discordia repraesentatur per impurum apud sanguinem et in sanguine, a quo defecandus; defecatio illa fit per vexationes, 
quae non aliud sunt quam tentationes varii generis, et postea per introductiones in gyros; prima introductio in gyros, est {3} ut accommodari possint simul; altera est ut cogitatio et loquela concordent; 
tertia est ut conveniant mutuo inter se quoad cogitationes et quoad affectiones; quarta est ut conveniant in veris et bonis. @1 i itaque$ @2 After societate$ @3 i solum$ </p>
