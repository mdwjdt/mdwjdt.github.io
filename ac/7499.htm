<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7499节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7499.</strong>“耶和华希伯来人的神这样说”表来自主，就是教会之神的一个命令。这从“说”和“希伯来人”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指一个命令（参看<a href="7036.htm">7036</a>，<a href="7107.htm">7107</a>，<a href="7310.htm">7310</a>节）；“希伯来人”是指那些属于教会的人，因而是指教会（<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="5236.htm">5236</a>，<a href="6675.htm">6675</a>，<a href="6684.htm">6684</a>，<a href="6738.htm">6738</a>节）。“耶和华”当在圣言中被提及时，是指主（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5041.htm">5041</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>，<a href="6281.htm">6281</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="6956.htm">6956</a>节）。在圣言中，就神性良善而言，主被称为“耶和华”，因为神性良善是神性本身；就神性真理而言，主被称为“神的儿子”，因为神性真理从神性良善发出，如同儿子来自父亲，也可以说从神性良善而生。不过，有必要详细说说这是怎么回事。当主在世时，祂使得祂所取的人身变成神性真理，那时称神性良善，也就是耶和华为祂的父。祂之所以如此行，是因为如刚才所述，神性真理从神性良善发出并出生。但主完全荣耀了祂自己之后（当祂在十字架上经历最后的试探时，这事便成就了），祂将祂的人身也变成了神性良善，也就是耶和华；神性真理本身由此从祂的神性人身发出。这神性真理就是那被称为“圣灵”的，是从神性人身发出的神圣。由此明显可知主在约翰福音中的话是什么意思：<br />圣灵还没有来，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.39.htm">7:39</a>）<br />被称为“父”的，是神性良善，被称为“子”的，是神性真理（参看<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。</p>

Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews. That this signifies a command from the Lord who is the God of the church, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being a command (see n. 7036, 7107, 
7310); and from the signification of "the Hebrews," as being those who are of the church, thus the church (n. 5136, 5236, 6675, 6684, 6738). (That "Jehovah" when named in the Word denotes the Lord, 
see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 6280, 6281, 6303, 6905, 6945, 6956.) In the Word the Lord is called "Jehovah" as to Divine good, for Divine good is the Divine Itself; and the Lord is 
called the "Son of God" as to Divine truth, for Divine truth proceeds from the Divine good as a son from a father, and also is said to be "born:" how this is shall be further told. When the Lord was 
in the world He made His Human Divine truth, and then called the Divine good which is Jehovah, His "Father;" because, as just said, Divine truth proceeds and is born from Divine good. But after the Lord 
had fully glorified Himself, which was done when He endured the last of temptation on the cross, He then made His Human also Divine good, that is, Jehovah; and thereby the Divine truth itself proceeded 
from His Divine Human. The Divine truth is what is called the "Holy Spirit," and is the holy which proceeds from the Divine Human. From this is evident what is meant by the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p> 
    The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39). That it is the Divine good which is called the "Father," and the Divine truth which is called the "Son," see n. 3704. </p>

'Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews' means a command from the Lord, who is the God of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as a command, dealt with in <a href="7036.htm">7036</a>, <a href="7107.htm">7107</a>, <a href="7310.htm">7310</a>; and from 
the meaning of 'the Hebrews' as those who belong to the Church, and so the Church itself, dealt with in <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="5236.htm">5236</a>, <a href="6675.htm">6675</a>, <a href="6684.htm">6684</a>, <a href="6738.htm">6738</a>, 'Jehovah', when that name is used in the Word, being the Lord, 
see <a href="1743.htm">1743</a>, <a href="1776.htm">1776</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5041.htm">5041</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="6945.htm">6945</a>, <a href="695.htm">695</a>. In the Word the Lord is called 'Jehovah' in respect of Divine Goodness, for Divine Goodness is the Divine itself, and the 
Lord is referred to as 'the Son of God' in respect of Divine Truth. For Divine Truth goes forth from Divine Goodness, as the Son does from the Father, and is also said to be born from it. But something 
more must be said to show what this implies. When the Lord was in the world He made the Human He had assumed Divine Truth, and at that time called Divine Goodness, which is Jehovah, His Father. He 
did so because, as has been stated, Divine Truth goes forth and is born from Divine Goodness. But after the Lord had fully glorified Himself, which was accomplished on the Cross when He underwent His 
last temptation of all, He then also made the Human He had assumed Divine Goodness, which is Jehovah, and it was from that Divine Goodness that Divine Truth itself went forth out of His Divine Human. 
This Divine Truth is what is called the Holy Spirit and is the holiness that goes forth from the Divine Human. This shows what the Lord's words in John are used to mean, </p>

`Ita dixit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum': quod significet mandatum a Domino, Qui Deus Ecclesiae, constat a significatione `dicere' quod sit mandatum, de qua n. 7036, 7107, 7310; ex significatione `Hebraeorum' 
quod sint qui ab Ecclesia, ita Ecclesia, de qua n. 5136, 5236, 6675, 6684, 6738; quod Jehovah, ubi {1}nominatur in Verbo, sit Dominus, videatur n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 6280, 
6303, 6281, 6905, 6945, 6956.  Dominus in Verbo dicitur `Jehovah' quoad Divinum Bonum, est enim Divinum Bonum Ipsum Divinum, et Dominus vocatur `Filius Dei' quoad Divinum Verum; Divinum enim Verum procedit 
a Divino Bono, ut Filius a Patre, et quoque dicitur nasci; quomodo cum hoc se habet, ulterius dicendum: Dominus {2}quando in mundo fuit, Humanum Suum fecit Divinum Verum, (c)et tunc vocavit Divinum 
Bonum, quod Jehovah, Patrem Suum, {3}quoniam, ut dictum est, Divinum Verum procedit ac nascitur a Divino Bono; sed postquam Dominus Se plene glorificavit, quod factum cum ultimum tentationis super 
cruce sustinuit, tunc quoque Humanum Suum fecit Divinum Bonum, {4}hoc est, Jehovam, et ab eo Ipsum Divinum Verum processit ex Divino Humano Ipsius; hoc Divinum Verum est quod vocatur (t)`Spiritus Sanctus,' 
et est sanctum quod a Divino Humano {5} procedit; inde patet quid intelligitur per Domini verba apud Johannem, Nondum erat Spiritus Sanctus, quia Jesus nondum glorificatus erat, vii 39. Quod 
Divinum Bonum sit quod `Pater' {6}nominatur, et Divinum Verum quod `Filius,' videatur n. 3704. 	@1 After Verbo$ 	@2 After Verum$ 	@3 quia Divinum Verum ut dictum procedit ac nascitur ex Divino Bono;
