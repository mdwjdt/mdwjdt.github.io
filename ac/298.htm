<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第298节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>298.</strong>创世记3:22 耶和华神说，那人已经与我们相似，能知道善恶。现在恐怕他伸手又取生命树吃，就永远活着。<br />此处提及“耶和华神”，先用单数，后用复数，这是因为，“耶和华神”意指主，同时也指天堂。“那人已经知道善恶”，表示他已成为属天者，具有智慧聪明。“恐怕他伸手又取生命树吃”，表示他不能被教导信的奥秘，否则他永远不能得救，亦即“永远活着”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]298.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_298/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_22" target=_top>Genesis 3:22</a>. And Jehovah God said, "Here, the human has been like one of us, knowing good and evil, and now perhaps people will put out their hand and take from the tree of lives as well, and eat, and live forever."<br />The reason Jehovah God speaks at first in the singular and then in the plural is that Jehovah God means the Lord and at the same time heaven with its angels. The fact that the human knew good and evil means that people became heavenly and so became wise and understanding. The implied desire that they not put out their hand and take from the tree of lives is a refusal to let them be taught the mysteries of faith. If they were taught, they would never be saved to all eternity, which is living forever.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} As Swedenborg makes clear in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_298/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_304" target=_top>304</a>, the phrase "living forever" paradoxically refers not to salvation but to damnation.

Verse 22. And Jehovah God said, Behold the man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil; and now lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity. The 
reason "Jehovah God" is first mentioned in the singular, and afterwards in the plural number, is that by "Jehovah God" is meant the Lord, and at the same time the angelic heaven. The man's "knowing 
good and evil" signifies that he had become celestial, and thus wise and intelligent; "lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of lives" means that he must not be instructed in the mysteries 
of faith, for then never to all eternity could he be saved, which is to "live to eternity." </p>

Verse 22 And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, in knowing good and evil; and now by chance he will put out his hand and also take from the tree of life' and eat, and live for 
ever.  </p>
<p>The reason Jehovah God speaks first in the singular and then in the plural is that 'Jehovah God' is used to mean the Lord, and at the same time the angelic heaven. 'The man's knowing good and 
evil' means that he became celestial, and so wise and having intelligence. 'He was not to put out his hand and take from the tree of life means that he was not to be instructed in mysteries of faith, 
for if he were instructed in them he could never at all be saved, which is 'living for ever'.

Vers. 22.  Et dixit Jehovah Deus, Ecce homo fuit sicut unus e nobis, sciendo bonum et malum; et nunc forte mittet manum suam, et sumet etiam ab arbore vitarum, et edat, et vivat in aeternum. Quod Jehovah 
Deus in singulari, et dein plurali loquatur, causa est quia per 'Jehovam Deum' intelligitur Dominus et simul caelum angelicum: quod homo 'sciverit bonum et malum' significat quod caelestis factus, 
ita sapiens et intelligens: quod 'non mitteret manum et sumeret de arbore vitarum' est quod non instruendus in mysteriis fidei, sic nusquam in aeternum salvari posset, quod est 'vivere in aeternum.' </p>
