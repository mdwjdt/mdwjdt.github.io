<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9763节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9763.</strong>“院子的门当有帘子”表引入该天堂，以及一个守卫，免得除了那些已经做好准备的人之外，还有什么人进入。这从“门”、“院子”和“帘子”的含义清楚可知：“门”是指联系和引入（参看<a href="8989.htm">8989</a>节）；“院子”是指最低层天堂（<a href="9741.htm">9741</a>节）；“帘子”是指一个禁止进入的守卫，因为帘子是用来守卫门的。它之所以是指一个守卫，免得除了那些已经做好准备的人之外，还有什么人进入，是因为没有人被引入天堂，除非他做好准备。此处的情况是这样：那些从尘世进入来世（死后即发生）的人会带来与天使所在的属灵和属天事物不一致的世俗和尘世事物。因此，那些要被提升进入天堂的人首先要做好准备，这种准备通过将他们所带来的世俗和尘世事物分离出去而实现。他们若过早地被提入天堂，就不可能留在那里的社群中，因为他们喜欢和热爱太过于粗鄙，以至于不适合天使的纯洁之物。但他们准备好之后，就会被主提升并引入天堂，然后被送往在信和爱的真理和良善方面与他们相一致的天使社群。由此可见当如何理解“一个守卫，免得除了那些已经做好准备的人之外，还有什么人进入”这句话。</p>

And for the gate of the court a covering. That this signifies introduction into this heaven, and a guard lest it should be entered by any except those who are prepared, is evident from the signification 
of a "gate," as being communication and introduction (see n. 8989); from the signification of "the court," as being the ultimate heaven (n. 9741); and from the signification of "the covering," as 
being a guard lest it be entered; for the gate was guarded by the covering. That it denotes a guard lest it should be entered by any except those who are prepared, is because no one is introduced into 
heaven unless he is prepared. The case herein is this. Those who come from the world into the other life, which takes place immediately after their decease, bring with them worldly and earthly things 
which do not agree with the spiritual and celestial things in which the angels are; and therefore those who are to be raised into heaven are first prepared, which is effected by the separation of the 
worldly and earthly things which they have brought with them; for if they were taken up into heaven sooner, they could not possibly remain in the societies there, because they have a taste and love for 
grosser things than are suited to the purity in which the angels are. But after they have been prepared, they are taken up and introduced by the Lord into heaven, and are admitted into those angelic 
societies with which they are in agreement in respect to the truths and goods of faith and of love. From all this it can be seen what is meant by a guard lest heaven should be entered by any except 
those who are prepared. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9763</b></p><p><b>9763.</b>
'And for the gate of the court there shall be a screen' means introduction into that heaven, and a guard that prohibits entry into it except by those who have been prepared. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'the gate' as communication with and introduction into, dealt with in <a href="8989.htm">8989</a>; from the meaning of 'the court' as the lowest heaven, dealt with in <a href="9741.htm">9741</a>; and from the meaning of 'a screen' as a guard 
that prohibits entry; for the screen served to guard the gate. The reason why it is a guard prohibiting entry except by those who have been prepared is that no one is introduced into heaven unless 
he has been prepared. The situation is that people who pass from the world into the next life, which happens immediately after death, bring with them worldly and earthly interests that are not in accord 
with the spiritual and heavenly things that angels are interested in. Therefore those who are to be raised to heaven first undergo preparation, which is carried out through the separation of the 
worldly and earthly interests which the person has brought with him. For if he were raised to heaven before he had undergone preparation he could not possibly remain in the communities there, since he 
has a taste for and loves things too crude to come up to the level of angelic purity. When people have been prepared however they are raised by the Lord and introduced into heaven, and are then sent 
into those angelic communities with which they are in tune so far as truths and forms of the good of faith and love are concerned. All this shows what should be understood by a guard that prohibits entry 
into heaven except by those who have been prepared.  </p>

`Et portae atrii tegumentum': quod significet introductionem in illud caelum, et custodiam ne intretur nisi a praeparatis, constat ex significatione `portae' quod (x)sit communicatio et introductio, 
de qua n. 8989, ex significatione `atrii' quod sit caelum ultimum, de qua n. 9741, et ex significatione `tegumenti' quod sit custodia ne intretur, nam per tegumentum custodiebatur porta; quod sit custodia 
ne intretur nisi a praeparatis, est quia nemo in caelum introducitur nisi praeparatus; cum hoc ita se habet: qui e mundo in alteram vitam veniunt, quod (x)fit statim post obitum, secum ferunt mundana 
et terrestria quae non concordant cum spiritualibus et caelestibus in quibus sunt angeli quapropter illi qui in caelum elevandi sunt prius praeparantur, quod fit per separationem mundanorum et terrestrium 
quae homo secum tulit; nam si prius in caelum elevaretur, nequaquam in societatibus ibi manere posset {1}, crassiora enim sapit et amat quam quae conveniunt puritati in (x)qua sunt angeli; 
cum autem praeparati sunt {2}, tunc (o)elevantur et introducuntur a Domino in caelum, ac immittuntur illis societatibus angelicis cum quibus quoad vera et bona fidei et amori concordant.  Ex his constare 
potest quid intelligitur per custodiam ne caelum intretur nisi a praeparatis. @1 potest$ @2 praeparati sunt altered to praeparatum est$ </p>
