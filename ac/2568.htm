<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2568节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2568.</strong>本章前面已说明，若请教理性，教义必变得无效（<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2538.htm">2538</a>节）；不能请教理性（<a href="2519.htm">2519</a>，<a href="2531.htm">2531</a>节）。但此处又说，信之教义富有理性和属世的良善与真理。乍一看，这些话似乎彼此冲突和矛盾，而事实上并非如此。前面说明了主是何情况，现在则告知人又是何情况。<br />对人来说，通过理性事物看待信之教义是一回事，通过信之教义看待理性事物完全是另一回事。通过理性事物看待信之教义就是不信圣言，或不信取自圣言的教义，除非人通过理性事物信服，事情的确如此；而通过信之教义看待理性事物就是先相信圣言，或取自圣言的教义，然后用理性事物加以确认。前一种情况颠倒秩序，导致什么也不信；而后一种才是真正的秩序，并使这个人更好地相信。经上说亚比米勒因那女人的缘故而必死在此就是指前一种情况，这句话的意思是若请教理性，信之教义必变得无效（<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2538.htm">2538</a>节）；而经上说亚比米勒赐下牛羊、仆婢是指后一种情况；这句话的意思是信之教义富有理性和属世的良善与真理。<br />就内义而言，这些事在圣言中有大量论述，尤其论及亚述和埃及的地方。原因在于，当通过理性事物来看待信之教义时，也就是说，当一个人若不通过理性事物信服事情的确如此，就不相信时，信之教义不仅变得无效，而且它所包含的任何事物也都被否认；而当通过信之教义来看待理性事物时，也就是说，当一个人相信圣言，后来用理性事物加以确认时，教义就是活的，而它所包含的任何事物都得到肯定。<br />因此，有两种基本心态：其中一种导向彻底的愚蠢和疯狂，而另一种则导向完美的聪明和智慧。前一种心态否认一切事，或发自内心说，除非通过理解而信服，或通过感官而理解力，否则就无法相信。这是一种导向彻底愚蠢和疯狂的心态，被称为否定态度。而另一种心态则肯定构成取自圣言教义的事物，或内心思考并相信那些事都是真的，因为主就这么说的。这是一种导向完美聪明和智慧的心态，被称为肯定态度。<br />凡出于否定态度思考问题的人越请教理性事物、记忆知识，甚至哲学概念，就越抛掷自己，沉入黑暗，直到最后否认一切。这是因为，人无法通过低级事物来理解高级事物，也就是说，无法通过低级事物来理解属灵和属天之物，更不用说神性事物了。因为这些事物远远超出他的全部理解力。而且，若是这种情况，人就会出于否定心态看待一切事。而另一方面，凡出于肯定态度思考问题的人则会通过尽可能利用的理性事物、记忆知识，甚至哲学概念来确认。因为对他们来说，所以这些事物都能起到确认作用，使他们对这个问题有更全面的认识。<br />此外，有些人在否认之前存有疑惑，而有些人在肯定之前存有疑惑。否认之前存有疑惑的，是那些倾向于邪恶生活的人；若被这种生活带走，那么他们只要想到这些事，就会否认它们。然而，肯定之前存有疑惑的人则倾向于良善的生活。若他们允许自己被主折向这种生活，那么他们越思考这些事，就越肯定。这个问题在下面的章节还会进一步予以论述。蒙主怜悯，我会在那里详述它们（参看<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2568</b></p><p><b>2568.</b>
It has been said above in this chapter that doctrine would become null and void if the rational were consulted (n. 2516, 2538); and that it was not consulted (n. 2519, 2531). But here it is said that 
the doctrine of faith was enriched with goods and truths both rational and natural. At first view these statements appear as if they were adverse and contrary to each other; and yet are not so. How the 
case was with the Lord, has been stated; but how it is with man, remains to be told. [2] As regards man it is one thing to regard the doctrine of faith from rational things, and altogether another 
to regard rational things from the doctrine of faith. To regard the doctrine of faith from rational things is not to believe in the Word, or in the doctrine thence derived, until one is persuaded from 
rational things that it is so; whereas to regard rational things from the doctrine of faith is first to believe in the Word, or in the doctrine therefrom, and then to confirm the same by rational things. 
The former is inverted order, and results in nothing being believed; whereas the latter is genuine order, and causes the man to believe the better. It is the former that is here meant by its being 
said that Abimelech should die because of the woman; by which is signified that the doctrine of faith would become null and void if the rational were consulted (n. 2516, 2538); but the latter is meant 
by its being said that Abimelech gave flock and herd, and menservants and maidservants; by which is signified that the doctrine of faith was enriched with rational and natural goods and truths. [3] 
These things are much treated of in the Word in its internal sense, especially where Asshur and Egypt are spoken of; for the reason that while the doctrine of faith is regarded from rational things, 
that is, while a man does not believe until he is persuaded from them that it is so, it then not only becomes null and void, but whatever is contained in it is also denied; whereas when rational things 
are regarded from the doctrine of faith, that is, when a man believes the Word, and afterwards the same things are confirmed by rational things, the doctrine is then living and whatever is contained 
in it is affirmed. [4] There are therefore two principles; one of which leads to all folly and insanity, and the other to all intelligence and wisdom. The former principle is to deny all things, or 
to say in the heart that we cannot believe them until we are convinced by what we can apprehend, or perceive by the senses; this is the principle that leads to all folly and insanity, and is to be called 
the negative principle. The other principle is to affirm the things which are of doctrine from the Word, or to think and believe within ourselves that they are true because the Lord has said them: 
this is the principle that leads to all intelligence and wisdom, and is to be called the affirmative principle. [5] The more they who think from the negative principle consult things rational, the 
more they consult memory-knowledges, and the more they consult things philosophical, the more do they cast and precipitate themselves into darkness, until at last they deny all things. The causes of 
this are, that no one can apprehend higher things from lower ones, that is, spiritual and celestial things, still less Divine things, from lower ones, because they transcend all understanding, and moreover 
everything is then involved in negatives from that principle. On the other hand, they who think from an affirmative principle can confirm themselves by whatever things rational, by whatever memory-knowledges, 
and whatever things philosophic they have at command; for all these are to them things confirmatory, and give them a fuller idea of the matter. [6] Moreover there are some who are in doubt 
before they deny, and there are some who are in doubt before they affirm. They who are in doubt before they deny are they who incline to a life of evil; and when this life carries them away, then 
insofar as they think of the matters in question they deny them. But they who are in doubt before they affirm are they who incline to a life of good; and when they suffer themselves to be bent to this 
by the Lord, then insofar as they think about those things so far they affirm. As this subject is further treated of in the verses which follow,. it is permitted of the Lord's Divine mercy to illustrate 
them more fully there (see n. 2588). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2568</b></p><p><b>2568.</b>
It was stated above in this chapter that doctrine would be brought to ruin if the rational were consulted, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2538.htm">2538</a>, and that it was not consulted, <a href="2519.htm">2519</a>, <a href="2531.htm">2531</a>; but here it is said that the doctrine 
of faith was enriched with both rational and natural goods and truths. At first glance these statements seem to express two conflicting and contrary ideas, but they do not in fact do so. It has been 
told how it was with the Lord, now it must be told how it is with man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With man it is one thing for him to regard the doctrine of faith from rational ideas but quite another to regard rational 
ideas from the doctrine of faith. Regarding the doctrine of faith from rational ideas occurs when someone does not believe in the Word, that is, in doctrine drawn from it, until he is persuaded on rational 
grounds that the thing is so. But regarding rational ideas from the doctrine of faith occurs when someone first of all believes in the Word or doctrine drawn from it and then confirms the same by 
rational ideas. The first approach is an inversion of order and leads to belief in nothing, whereas the second is genuine order and leads to greater belief. It is the first that is expressed by 'you 
will die on account of the woman', meaning that the doctrine of faith would be brought to ruin if the rational were consulted, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2538.htm">2538</a>, but the second by 'Abimelech gave flocks and herds, and men 
servants and women servants', meaning that the doctrine of faith was enriched with rational and natural goods and truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These matters receive considerable treatment in the Word in its internal 
sense, especially when Asshur and Egypt are referred to, the reason being that when the doctrine of faith is regarded from rational ideas, that is, when someone does not believe until he is persuaded 
on rational grounds that the thing is so, it is not only in that case brought to ruin but also whatever is contained within it is denied. But when rational ideas are regarded from the doctrine of faith, 
that is, when he believes the Word and after that confirms the same things by means of rational ideas, doctrine is in that case living and whatever is contained within it is regarded affirmatively. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
There are therefore two basic attitudes of mind, the first leading to utter stupidity and insanity, the second to perfect intelligence and wisdom. The first occurs when someone denies everything, 
that is, says in his heart that he is unable to believe those things until he is convinced by things which he can grasp in his mind and perceive with his senses. This is an attitude which leads 
to utter stupidity and insanity and must be termed the negative attitude. The second occurs when someone regards affirmatively the things which comprise doctrine drawn from the Word, that is, when he 
thinks within himself and believes that those things are true because the Lord has spoken them. This is an attitude that leads to perfect intelligence and wisdom, and must be termed the affirmative attitude. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
The more those who think from the negative attitude consult rational ideas and the more they consult factual knowledge and the more they consult philosophical concepts, the more they pitch 
themselves headlong into darkness, till at length they deny everything. The reasons for this are that nobody is able from things that are lower to grasp with his mind those that are higher, that is, 
from those that are lower to grasp those that are spiritual and celestial, still less those that are Divine, since these go above and beyond his entire understanding. And what is more, when this is 
the case everything is regarded from a basically negative attitude of mind. On the other hand, however, people who think from the affirmative attitude are able to confirm themselves by whatever rational 
ideas, and by whatever factual knowledge, indeed by any philosophical concepts, which they are able in any way to make use of, for to them all these matters are confirmatory and enable them to have 
a fuller idea of the matter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In addition there are those who are in doubt before they deny, and there are those who are in doubt before they accept affirmatively. Those in doubt before denying 
are people who are disposed towards a life of evil; and when carried away by that life, then insofar as they think about those matters they deny them. Those however in doubt before accepting affirmatively 
are people who are disposed towards a life of good; and when they allow themselves to be turned to that life by the Lord, then insofar as they think about those matters they accept them affirmatively. 
Since this subject is taken further in the verses that follow this, let them in the Lord's Divine mercy be illustrated more fully at that point; see <a href="2588.htm">2588</a>. </p>

Supra in hoc capite dictum quod doctrina nulla fieret si consuleretur rationale, n. 2516, 2538, et quod nec consultum fuerit, n. 2519, 2531; hic autem dicitur quod doctrina fidei locupletata sit bonis 
et veris tam rationalibus quam naturalibus; haec primo intuitu apparent sicut forent sibi adversa et contraria, sed usque non sunt: quomodo apud Dominum fuit, dictum est; at quomodo apud hominem [est], 
dicendum: [2] apud hominem prorsus aliud est ex rationalibus spectare doctrinam fidei, et aliud ex doctrina fidei spectare rationalia; e rationalibus spectare doctrinam fidei, est non prius credere 
Verbo seu doctrinae quae inde quam cum ex rationalibus persuadetur quod i sit; at ex doctrina fidei spectare rationalia, est primum credere Verbo seu doctrinae inde, et dein eadem confirmare per rationalia; 
illud est inversus ordo, et facit ut nihil credatur, hoc autem est genuinus ordo, et facit ut melius credatur; illud est quod `morieris propter mulierem,' quibus significatur quod doctrina fidei 
nulla fieret si consuleretur rationale, n. 2516, 2538; hoc autem quod `Abimelech dedit gregem et armentum, et servos et ancillas,' quibus significatur quod doctrina fidei locupletata sit bonis et 
veris rationalibus et naturalibus.  [3] De his multum agitur in Verbo in sensu ejus interno, imprimis ubi de Asshure et de Aegypto {1}, ex causa quia dum doctrina fidei spectatur ex rationalibus, hoc 
est, non prius creditur quam homo ex illis persuadetur quod ita sit, quod tunc non modo nulla fiat, sed etiam negetur quicquid ibi; at dum ex doctrina fidei spectantur rationalia, hoc est, quod credatur 
Verbo, et dein eadem confirmentur per rationalia, quod tunc doctrina vivat, et affirmetur quicquid ibi; [4] sunt itaque duo principia, unum quod ducit ad omnem insipientiam et insaniam, alterum quod 
ducit ad omnem intelligentiam et sapientiam; illud principium est negare omnia, seu dicere corde suo quod non credere possit illa priusquam convincatur ab illis quae capere aut sentire potest; hoc 
principium est quod ducit ad omnem insipientiam et insaniam, et dicendum est principium negativum; alterum principium est affirmare illa quae doctrinae ex Verbo sunt, seu apud se cogitare et credere quod 
vera sint quia Dominus dixit; hoc principium est quod ducit ad omnem intelligentiam et sapientiam, et dicendum est principium affirmativum: [5] qui ex principio negativo cogitant, quo plus consulunt 
rationalia, quo plus scientifica, et quo plus philosophica, eo plus conjiciunt et praecipitant se in tenebras, usque tandem ut negent omnia; causae sunt quia nemo (t)capere potest ex inferioribus superiora, 
hoc est, ex illis spiritualia et caelestia, minus adhuc Divina quia transcendunt omnem intellectam, et praeterea involvuntur tunc singula negativis ex principio; vicissim autem, qui ex principio 
affirmativo cogitant, ii possunt se confirmare per quaecumque rationalia et per quaecumque scientifica, immo per philosophica, per quae usquam possunt; sunt enim ea omnia illis confirmantia, et dant 
eis ideam pleniorem rei.  [6] Praeterea sunt qui in dubio sunt antequam negant, et sunt qui in dubio antequam affirmant; qui in dubio sunt antequam negant, sunt ii qui inclinant ad vitam mali, quae 
vita cum aufert, tunc quantum cogitant de illis: tantum negant; qui autem in dubio sunt antequam affirmant, sunt ii qui inclinant ad vitam boni, ad quam cum flecti se patiuntur a Domino, tunc quantum 
cogitant de illis, tantum affirmant.  Quia de his ulterius in versibus qui sequuntur, agitur, licet, ex Domini Misericordia, ea ibi plenius illustrare; (o)videatur n. 2588. 	@1 i agit.$ </p>
