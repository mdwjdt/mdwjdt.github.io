<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4717节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4717.</strong>“有人遇见他，看哪，他在田野游荡”表他们已经偏离了教会所知的普遍真理。这从“在田野游荡”的含义清楚可知，“在田野游荡”是指偏离教会的普遍真理；因为“田野”表示教会的良善（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3196.htm">3196</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节），“田野的人”表示源于教义的生活之良善（<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>节）。经上之所以说“人”（man[vir]），是因为“人”表示教会所拥有的真理（<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>节）。当人们承认主，但不承认祂人身为神性，以及承认信为本质，而非仁时，就说他们偏离了教会所知的普遍真理。这二者（即主的神性人身和仁爱）中的每一个都是教会的一个普遍真理，并且当教会成员偏离了其中任何一个时，他就偏离了普遍真理。凡如此偏离的人很快就会偏离接下来所论述的具体真理。例如，任何人若从一个虚假原则开始，并基于这种原则进行推论，就会由此产生虚假观念；因为基本原则在其一切推论中占据主导地位，而这些推论则用来佐证或强化虚假原则。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4717</b></p><p><b>4717.</b>
And a man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field. That this signifies that they were fallen away from the general truth of the church, is evident from the signification of "wandering in 
the field," as being to fall away from the general truth of the church; for a "field" is the church as to good (n. 2971, 3196, 3766), and a "man of the field" is the good of life from doctrinals (n. 3310). 
It is said a "man," because by a "man" [vir] is signified the truth of the church (n. 3134). Those are said to fall away from the general truth of the church who acknowledge the Lord, but not His 
Human as Divine; and also those who acknowledge faith as essential, but not charity. Each is a general truth of the church, and when a man recedes from it he falls away from general truth; and whoever 
does this, soon falls away from specific truths (of which in what follows); just as when anyone starts with a false principle and from it deduces consequences, these also become false, because the 
principle rules in the consequents, and by these the false principle is also strengthened. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4717</b></p><p><b>4717.</b>
'And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field' means that they had fallen away from general truth known to the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'wandering in the field' as 
falling away from general truth known to the Church; for 'a field' means the Church as regards good, <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3196.htm">3196</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>, and 'a man of the field' means the good of life that has its origin in matters of 
doctrine, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>. The word 'men' (vir) is used because 'a man' means the truth which the Church possesses, <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>. People are said to fall away from general truth known to the Church when they acknowledge 
the Lord but not the Divinity of His Human, and also when they acknowledge faith, not charity, as that which is essential. Each of these - the Lord's Divine Human, and charity - is a general truth known 
to the Church, and when a member of the Church departs from either one he falls away from general truth. Anyone who falls away from this goes on to fall away from specific truths, which are the subject 
in what follows. For example, anyone who begins with a false assumption, and makes deductions on the basis of that assumption, thereby produces false ideas; for the basic assumption reigns in all 
his deductions, and these serve to corroborate the false assumption. </p>

</p><b>4717.</b>
`Et invenit eum vir, et ecce errans in agro': quod significet quod a vero communi Ecclesiae lapsi, constat a significatione `errare in agro' quod sit a vero communi Ecclesiae labi, `ager' enim est 
Ecclesia quoad bonum, n. 2971, 3196, 3766, et `vir agri' est bonum vitae ex doctrinalibus, n. 3310; vir dicitur quia per `virum' significatur verum quod est Ecclesiae, n. 3134.  A vero communi Ecclesiae 
labi {1} dicuntur qui agnoscunt Dominum, sed non Humanum Ipsius Divinum, ut et qui agnoscunt fidem pro essentiali, non autem charitatem; utrumque est verum commune Ecclesiae, a quo {2} cum 
recedit homo Ecclesiae, a vero communi labitur; qui ab hoc {3}, is postmodum a veris in specie {3}, de quibus in sequentibus; sicut qui a principio falso incohat, et ab eo {4} deducit consequentia, 
inde haec (t)fiunt falsa quia in consequentibus regnat principium, et quoque per haec principium falsum corroboratur.      @1 lapsi$      @2 qua$      @3 A d labitur.  Probably one of these should 
have been  left.$      @4 inde$ </p>
