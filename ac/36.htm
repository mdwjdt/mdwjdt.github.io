<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>36.</strong>将信与爱分裂的人，甚至不知何为信。当揣摩之，有的视之为思想，有的视之为对主的看法，也有的视之为教义。然而，信并非只是对教导的认识和认同而已。首要的，它是对教导的服从，而教导的核心是爱主与爱邻，这是要求人服从的。缺乏爱的人不可能拥有信，这是毋庸置疑的，正如主明确宣告说：“第一要紧的，就是说，以色列啊，你要听，主我们神是独一的主，你要尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱主你的神，其次，就是说，要爱人如己，再没有比这两条诫命更大的了。”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.28.htm">12:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.34.htm">34</a>）<br />在马太福音，主称“爱主你的神”是诫命中“第一且最大的”，且说“这两条诫命是律法和先知一切道理的总纲”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.35.htm">22:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">40</a>）。“律法和先知”表信仰的全部教导，也表整部圣经。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]36.</strong> People who have separated faith from love do not even know what faith is. When they try to picture it, some see it merely as thought. Some view it only as thoughts about the Lord. A few equate it with the teachings of faith.<br />But faith is more than the knowledge and acknowledgment of all that is encompassed in the teachings of faith. First and foremost it is obedience to everything that faith teaches; and the primary thing faith teaches and requires our obedience to is love for the Lord and love for our neighbor. No one who lacks this possesses faith. The Lord teaches this so clearly in Mark that no one can doubt it:<br />The first of all the commandments is "Listen, Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord. Therefore you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your powers." This is the first commandment. A second, similar one, of course, is this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." There is no other commandment greater than these. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_36/bible_king-james-version_mark_12_28-34" target=_top>Mark 12:28-34</a>)<br />In Matthew he calls the former the first and great commandment and says that the Law and the Prophets depend on these commandments (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_36/bible_king-james-version_matthew_22_35-40" target=_top>Matthew 22:35-40</a>). "The Law and the Prophets" are the teachings of faith, all-inclusively, and the whole Word.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "The Law and the Prophets" refer to two main sections of the Hebrew Scriptures: the Law or Torah, comprising the five books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy; and the Prophets, including Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. Since Swedenborg here explains the phrase as referring to "the whole Word," he is apparently extending it as well to parts of a third section of the Hebrew Scriptures known as the "Writings," which includes poetic and philosophical works such as the Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes; but see also notes 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_36/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_0" target=_top>0</a>, and 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_36/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_64" target=_top>64</a>. (Swedenborg included Daniel among the Prophets, but in the Hebrew Scriptures it is included in the Writings.) [RS] </p>

They who have separated faith from love do not even know what faith is. When thinking of faith, some imagine it to be mere thought, some that it is thought directed toward the Lord, few that it is the 
doctrine of faith. But faith is not only a knowledge and acknowledgment of all things that the doctrine of faith comprises, but especially is it an obedience to all things that the doctrine of faith 
teaches. The primary point that it teaches, and that which men should obey, is love to the Lord, and love toward the neighbor, for if a man is not in this, he is not in faith. This the Lord teaches so 
plainly as to leave no doubt concerning it, in Mark: </p>
<p>     The foremost of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord; therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all 
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the foremost commandment; and the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; there 
is none other commandment greater than these (Mark 12:29-31).     In Matthew, the Lord calls the former of these the "first and great commandment" and says that "on these commandments hang all the law 
and the Prophets" (Matt. 22:37-41). The "law and the Prophets" are the universal doctrine of faith, and the whole Word. </p>

People who have separated faith from love do not even know what faith is. When they do entertain an idea about faith, some of them see it only as mere thought, others as thought directed towards the 
Lord, and a few as the doctrine of faith. But faith involves not only knowledge of all the things that the doctrine of faith embraces and the acknowledgment of them; it is first and foremost obedience 
to everything that doctrine teaches. The primary point that it teaches for men's obedience is love of the Lord and love of the neighbour. Whoever is devoid of this is devoid of faith, a point which the 
Lord teaches so plainly in Mark as to leave absolutely no room for doubt,  </p>
<blockquote>
The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. Therefore you shall love the Lord your 
God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. The second is also like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. 
There is no other commandment greater than these. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2011:28-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 11:28-33</a>.   
</blockquote>
In Matthew He calls the former 'the first and great commandment', and says 'on these commandments the Law and Prophets depend', 22:75-40. The Law and the Prophets are the doctrine of faith in its entirety and the whole of the Word.  </p>

</p><b>36.</b>
Qui separarunt fidem ab amore, ne quidem sciunt quid fides; dum in idea fidei sunt, quidam non sciunt aliter quam quod sit mera cogitatio; aliqui, quod sit cogitatio in Dominum; pauci, quod sit doctrina 
fidei: sed fides est non solum cognitio omnium quae complectitur doctrina fidei, et eorum agnitio, sed imprimis est oboedientia omnium quae docet; primarium quod docet, cui oboedient, est amor Domini 
et amor proxImi, in quo qui non est, non est in fide; quod ita clare docet Dominus ut nusquam possit dubitari, apud Marcum ita, Primarium omnium praeceptorum est, Audi Israel, Dominus Deus noster, 
Dominus unus est, ideo amabis Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua, et ex tota mente tua, et ex omnibus viribus tuis; hoc primarium est praeceptum; alterum quidem simile hoc, Amabis 
proximum tuum, sicut te ipsum; majus his aliud praeceptum non est, {x}xii 28-33. Apud Matthaeum appellat illud 'Primum et Magnum Mandatum,' et quod 'ex illis mandatis Lex et Prophetae pendeant,' 
{x}xxii 34-38 [A.V. 35-40]. Lex et Prophetae sunt universa doctrina fidei et omne Verbum. </p>
