Verses 18-20. And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban said, It is better that I should give her to thee than give her to another 
man; abide with me. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were in his eyes as a few days for the love he had to her. "And Jacob loved Rachel," signifies the love of good toward internal truth; 
"and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter," signifies study, and at the same time a holy state, in order to be conjoined with internal truth; "and Laban said, It 
is better that I should give her to thee than give her to another man; abide with me," signifies a means of conjunction through interior truth with that good; "and Jacob served seven years for Rachel," 
signifies the accomplishment; "and they were in his eyes as a few days, for the love he had to her," signifies a state of love. </p>

Verses 18-20 And Jacob loved Rachel and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter. And Laban said, It is better for me to give her to you than for me to give her to another 
man; remain with me. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they were in his eyes like a few days, because of his love for her. </p>
<p>'Jacob loved Rachel' means the love which good has for internal 
truth. 'And said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter' means a diligent effort to be made during a holy state, to the end that it might be joined to internal truth. 'And Laban 
said, It is better for me to give her to you than for me to give her to another man; remain with me' means the means by which interior truth is joined to that good. 'And Jacob served seven years for 
Rachel' means the fulfilment. 'And they were in his eyes like a few days, because of his love for her' means a state of love. </p>

Vers. 18-20.  Et amabat Jacob Rachelem, et dixit, Serviam tibi septem annis pro Rachele filia tua minore.  Et dixit Laban, Bonum dare me illam tibi, prae dare me illam viro alii; mane cum me.  Et 
servivit Jacob pro Rachele septem annis; et fuerunt in oculis ejus sicut dies aliqui in amando illo eam.  `Amabat Jacob Rachelem' significat boni amorem erga verum internum:  `et dixit, Serviam tibi 
septem annis pro Rachele filia tua minore' significat  studium, et tunc statum sanctum ut cum interno vero conjungeretur:  `et dixit Laban, Bonum dare me illam tibi prae dare me illam viro alii; 
mane mecum' significat medium conjunctionis per verum interius cum illo bono:  `et servivit Jacob pro Rachele septem annis' significat effectum:  `et fuerunt in oculis ejus sicut dies aliqui in amando 
illo eam' significat statum amoris. </p>
