<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3752节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3752.</strong>没有人能理解这些话的含义，除非他受内义启示。这些话不是指着耶路撒冷的毁灭说的，这一事实从本章提到的许多事明显看出来，如这句话：“若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的；只是为选民，那日子必减少了” ；还有后面的经文：“那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。那时，人子的兆头要显出来；他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临”，以及其它经文。这些话也不是指世界的毁灭说的，这一点也可从本章所提到的许多事明显看出来。如在前文，经上说：“在房顶上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳”；还有现在正在讨论的：“你们要祷告，使你们的逃走不在冬天，也不在安息日”；以及后面的经文：“那时，两个人在田里，取去一个，撇下一个；两个女人在磨坊推磨，取去一个，撇下一个”。显然，这些话是指着教会的末期，也就是它的荒废说的。因为当仁爱不复存在时，可以说教会荒废了。</p>

No one can possibly comprehend the signification of these words unless he is enlightened by the internal sense. That they are not said concerning the destruction of Jerusalem appears from many things 
in the chapter, as from this: </p>
<p>     Except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be preserved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened; </p>
<p>and from the following: </p>
<p>     After 
the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then shall appear 
the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory; </p>
<p>and from other passages. That neither are the words now under consideration said 
concerning the destruction of the world, is also evident from many things contained in the same chapter; as from those which precede: </p>
<p>     He that is on the housetop, let him not come down to take 
anything out of his house; and he who is in the field, let him not return back to take his garments; </p>
<p>and also from these now brought under consideration: </p>
<p>     Pray ye that your flight be not in the 
winter, neither on the Sabbath; </p>
<p>and from the following: </p>
<p>     Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left; two women shall be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken, 
and the other left. But it is evident that the words in question are said concerning the last time of the church, that is, concerning its vastation; for the church is said to be vastated when there 
is no longer any charity. </p>

No one can possibly grasp what these words mean unless he has been enlightened by means of the internal sense. The fact that they are not utterances concerning the destruction of Jerusalem is apparent 
from many things said in that chapter, for example from the statement 'unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short'; and the 
statement further on, 'after the affliction of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man; and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory'; and from other statements. Nor are they utterances concerning 
the destruction of the world, as is also evident from many things said in this same chapter. In what has gone before, for example, it is said, 'Let him who is at that time on the housetop not go down 
to take anything out of his house, and let him who is in the field not turn back to fetch his clothes', then in what is up for consideration in this section - 'Pray that your flight may not take place 
in winter or on a sabbath', and in what occurs further on, 'At that time two will be in the field; one will be taken, the other left; two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, the 
other left'. But such utterances, it is evident, concern the final period of the Church, that is, its vastation. It is said to have undergone vastation when charity does not exist any longer. </p>

Quid haec verba significant, nusquam aliquis comprehendere potest nisi illustratus per sensum internum; quod non dicta sint de destructione Hierosolymae, apparet (c)a pluribus in illo capite, ut ex 
his, `Nisi contraherentur dies isti, non conservaretur ulla caro, sed propter electos contrahentur dies illi' et ex sequentibus,{1} `post afflictionem dierum illorum sol obscurabitur, et luna non 
dabit lumen suum, et stellae cadent de caelo, et virtutes caelorum commovebuntur; et tunc apparebit signum Filii hominis, et videbunt Filium hominis venientem in nubibus caeli cum virtute et gloria,' 
et ex {2}aliis. {3}Quod nec dicta sint de interitu mundi, etiam a pluribus in eodem capite patet, ut ex illis quae praecedunt `Qui tunc super domo est, ne descendat ad tollendum quid e domo sua, 
et qui in agro, ne revertatur retro ad tollendum vestimenta sua'; tum ex his quae nunc allata, `Orate ne fiat fuga vestra in hieme, neque in sabbato'; et a sequentibus, `Tunc duo erunt in agro, 
unus assumetur, alter relinquetur; duae molentes, una assumetur, altera relinquetur.' Sed patet quod dicta sint de ultimo tempore Ecclesiae, hoc est, de ejus vastatione; quae tunc vastata dicitur, 
cum amplius nulla charitas. @1 i quod$ @2 i pluribus$ @3 i Et$ </p>
