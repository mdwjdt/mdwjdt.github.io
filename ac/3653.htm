<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3653节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3653.</strong>综上所述，明显可知，这几节经文全面描述了教会在爱之良善和信之真理上荒凉的状态；同时，经上也告诫那些具有这类良善与真理的人在这种情况下当做什么。教会里有三类人，即：具有对主之爱的人，具有对邻之仁的人和具有对真理的情感之人。属于第一类的，也就是那些具有对主之爱的人尤以“在犹太的，应当逃到山上”这一告诫来表示。属于第二类的，也就是那些具有对邻之仁的人尤以“在房顶上的，不要下来拿家里的东西”这一告诫来表示。而属于第三类的，也就是那些具有对真理的情感之人则尤以“在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳”这一告诫来表示。请参阅前面（<a href="2454.htm">2454</a>节）有关这些话的阐述和解释；那里还解释了“回头”和“在他后面一看”的意思。</p>

From all this it is now evident that in these verses there is fully described the state of devastation of the church in respect to the goods of love and the truths of faith, and that at the same time 
there is given an exhortation to those who are in these goods and truths in regard to what they ought then to do. There are three kinds of men within the church; namely, those who are in love to the 
Lord; those who are in charity toward the neighbor; and those who are in the affection of truth. Those who belong to the first class, who are in love to the Lord, are specifically signified in the words, 
"let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains." Those in the second class, who are in charity toward their neighbor, are specifically signified in the words, "let him that is upon the housetop 
not go down to take anything out of his house." Those in the third class, who are in the affection of truth, are specifically signified in the words, "and let him that is in the field not return back 
to take his garment." (See what has been said and explained above in regard to these words, n. 2454; and what is meant by "returning back," and "looking behind him.") </p>

From these considerations it may now be seen that these verses give a thorough description of the state of the Church when vastated as regards the goods of love and as regards the truths of faith. At 
the same time they urge what is to be done in those circumstances by those with whom such goods and truths are present. There are three kinds of people within the Church, namely, those who are moved 
by love to the Lord, those who are moved by charity towards the neighbour, and those who are moved by the affection for truth. Members of the first group - those moved by love to the Lord - are meant 
specifically in the injunction, Let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains. Members of the second group are those who are moved by charity towards the neighbour; and these are meant specifically 
in, Let him who is on the roof of the house not go down to take anything out of his house. Members of the third group are those who are moved by the affection for truth; and these are meant specifically 
in, Let him who is in the field not turn back to get his clothing. See what has been stated and explained already about these matters in Volume Two, in <a href="2454.htm">2454</a>, and also in the same paragraph what 
is meant by 'turning back' and 'looking back behind oneself'. </p>

Ex his nunc constare potest quod status vastationis Ecclesiae quoad bona amoris et vera fidei in his versibus plene descriptus sit, et quod simul hortatio ad illos qui in illis sunt, quid tunc facient: 
 sunt triplicis generis homines intra Ecclesiam, nempe qui in amore in Dominum sunt, qui in charitate erga proximum, et qui in affectione veri; {1}qui in prima classe sunt, {2}nempe qui in amore in 
Dominum{3}, in specie significantur per quod `qui in Judaea, fugiant in montes' in altera classe sunt illi qui in charitate erga proximum, et in specie significantur per `qui super tecto domus, ne descendat 
ad tollendum quid e domo sua':  in tertia classe sunt illi qui in affectione veri, et in specie significantur per `qui in agro ne revertatur retro ad accipiendum vestem suam.'  Videantur quae 
de his prius in Altera Parte n. 2454 dicta, et quae explicata sunt, et ibi quoque quid sit `reverti retro, et respicere post se. @1 illi$ @2 ita$ @3 i sunt,et$ </p>
