<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5381.</strong>在大人中，那些构成肾脏、输尿管和膀胱的人具有这样的天性：他们只喜欢认真探究和检查别人的秉性；并且只要这种行为正当，其中一些人还想要纠正和惩罚。肾脏、输尿管和膀胱的功能也是这样，因为它们检查被输送到它们里面的血液，以查看它里面是否有任何无用或有害的血清。它们会将无用或有害的与有用的分开，然后净化它；因为它们会将它输送到较低部位，在下降的途中以及到达那里后用各种方式搅扰它。这就是那些构成包含这些部位的区域之人的功能。但与实际的尿液，尤其臭尿相对应的灵人和灵人社群是地狱社群。因为一旦尿液从血液中分离出来，尽管它在肾小管或膀胱中，却仍在身体之外；因为被分离出去的东西不再在体内循环，因此对身体各部分的存在和持续存在没有任何助益。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5381</b></p><p><b>5381.</b>
They who constitute the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder in the Grand Man, are of such a disposition that they desire nothing more than to explore and to search out the quality of others; 
and there are some of them who are eager to chastise and to punish, provided there is some justice in the case. The functions of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are of this kind; for they explore 
the blood thrown into them to see whether there is any useless and hurtful serum in it, which they separate from what is useful, and then correct it; for they drive it down toward lower positions, and 
on the way and afterward they agitate it in various ways. These are the functions of those who constitute the province of the parts in question. But the spirits and societies of spirits to which the 
urine itself, especially fetid urine, corresponds, are infernal; for as soon as the urine is separated from the blood, although it is in the little tubes of the kidneys or within the bladder, still it 
is out of the body; for what has been separated no longer circulates in the body, and therefore does not contribute anything to the coming into existence and subsistence of its parts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5381</b></p><p><b>5381.</b>
Those who constitute the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder in the Grand Man are by nature such that there is nothing they like more than to explore and examine closely other people's characters. 
They are also ones who wish to correct and punish, provided that such an action is at all justly warranted. The functions of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are also like this, for they explore 
the blood attracted into them to discover any useless or harmful fluid there. This they separate from what is useful and then purify it; for they send it down to lower parts, harrying it both on the 
way down and by various methods when it gets there. Such are the functions of those who constitute the province incorporating those parts. But the spirits and communities of spirits to which actual 
urine, especially stinking urine, corresponds are hellish ones. For as soon as the urine has been separated from the blood, even though still in the tubules of the kidneys or else held in the bladder, 
it is nevertheless outside the body, since what has been separated no longer circulates around the body and does not therefore contribute in any way to the continuing existence of its parts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5381</b>
</p><b>5381.</b>
Qui provinciam renum, ureterum et vesicae in Maximo Homine constituunt, sunt tali genio ut nihil potius velint quam explorare et {1} scrutari quales alii sunt, et sunt quoque qui cupiunt castigare et 
punire, modo aliquid justitiae in causa sit.  Munia etiam renum, ureterum et vesicae talia sunt, nam sanguinem in {2} se prolectum {3} explorant si quid seri inutilis et damnosi ibi sit, et quoque separant 
ab utili, et dein castigant, nam versus inferiora detrudunt, et in via et dein variis modis vexant; haec munia sunt illorum qui provinciam illarum partium constituunt.  At spiritus et spirituum 
societates quibus ipsa urina, imprimis urina fetida, correspondet, sunt infernales; ut primum enim urina separata est a sanguine, tametsi est in tubulis renum, aut intus in vesica, usque est extra corpus, 
nam quod separatum est, non magis aliquem circulum in corpore facit, proinde non ad ejus partium existentiam et subsistentiam aliquid contribuit. </p>
