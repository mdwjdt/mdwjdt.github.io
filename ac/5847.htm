<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5847.</strong>没有哪个世人、灵人或天使拥有来源于他自己的任何生命。既如此，他所思考或意愿的一切，无一来源于他自己；因为人的生命在于思维和意愿，其言行则是源于思维和意愿的生命。生命唯有一个，就是主的生命；它流入每个人，却以各种方式被接受，事实上照着人通过自己的生活所赋予其灵魂的品质被接受。因此，在恶人中间，良善与真理被转变为邪恶与虚假；但在善人中间，良善作为良善被接受，真理作为真理被接受。这好比阳光流入不同的物体，这些物体照其组成部分所取的形式以多种方式调整和改变这光；光以这种方式被转化为或暗或亮的色彩。当人活在世上时，他为构成其内层的最纯粹的实质提供了一个外在形式，以致人可以说他给自己的灵魂带来形式，或说他形成自己的灵魂，也就是塑造或形成它的品质。该形式决定了主的生命，就是祂对全人类之爱的生命如何被接受。生命唯有一个，世人、灵人和天使是生命的接受者（参看<a href="1954.htm">1954</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="2706.htm">2706</a>，<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>，<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>，<a href="3001.htm">3001</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>，<a href="3337.htm">3337</a>，<a href="3338.htm">3338</a>，<a href="3484.htm">3484</a>，<a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3743.htm">3743</a>，<a href="4151.htm">4151</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4320.htm">4320</a>，<a href="4417.htm">4417</a>，<a href="4524.htm">4524</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>节）。</p>

No man, spirit, or angel ever has any life from himself, thus neither can he think and will from himself; because in thinking and willing is the life of man, and speaking and acting is the life thence 
derived. For there is one only life, that of the Lord, which flows into all, but is variously received, and indeed according to the quality which a man has induced on his soul by his life. Hence with 
the evil, goods and truths are turned into evils and falsities, but with the good they are received-goods as goods, and truths as truths. This may be compared to the light of the sun flowing into objects, 
which is modified and varied in them diversely according to the form of the parts, and thus is turned into colors, some sad and some cheerful. While a man lives in the world he induces a form on 
the purest substances of his interiors, so that it may be said that he forms his soul, that is, its quality; and according to this form is received the life of the Lord, which is the life of His love 
toward the universal human race. (That there is one only life, and that men, spirits, and angels are recipients of life, see n. 1954, 2021, 2706, 2886-2889, 2893, 3001, 3318, 3337, 3338, 3484, 3741-3743, 
4151, 4249, 4318-4320, 4417, 4524, 4882.) </p>

No man, spirit, or angel possesses any life that originates within himself. That being so, there is nothing he thinks or wills that can originate in himself; for a person's life consists in his thinking 
and willing, and his words and actions are the life that springs from them. There is only one life, the Lord's. It flows into everyone but is received in varying ways, its reception being determined 
by the character a person has given his soul through the life he leads. With people who are evil therefore, forms of good and truths are turned into evils and falsities; with those who are good, forms 
of good are accepted as forms of good and truths as truths. This may be compared to light flowing from the sun into different objects which modify and variegate the light in many ways, depending on 
the form their constituent parts take, and in this way the light is converted into colours that may be either dull or bright. While a person lives in the world he is providing an outward form for the 
most pure substances that constitute his interiors, so that one may speak of him bringing form to his own soul, that is, fashioning its character. This form determines how the Lord's life, flowing from 
His love towards the entire human race, is received.

Nusquam enim aliquis homo, spiritus aut angelus vitam habet a se, ita nec a se cogitare et velle potest, nam in cogitare et velle est vita hominis; loqui et agere est vita inde; unica enim est vita, 
nempe Domini, quae influit in omnes, sed varie recipitur et quidem secundum quale quod homo induxit animae suae per vitam; inde apud malos bona et vera vertuntur in mala et falsa, apud bonos recipiuntur 
bona ut bona, et vera ut vera. Hoc comparari potest luci quae a sole influit in objecta, quae ibi modificatur et variegatur diversimode secundum formam partium, et inde vertitur in colores vel tristes 
vel laetos; homo dum vivit in mundo, formam inducit substantiis purissimis quae sunt interiorum ejus, sic ut dici queat quod formet animam suam,   hoc est, quale ejus, secundum illam formam recipitur 
vita Domini quae est amoris Ipsius erga universum genus humanum. Quod unica vita sit, et quod homines, spiritus, et angeli, sint {1} recipientes vitae, videatur n. 1954, 2021, 2706, 2886-2889, 2893,
