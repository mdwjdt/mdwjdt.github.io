<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10028节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10028</strong>.“把所有的血都倒在坛的底座上”表完全存在于感官知觉层面，就是人生命的最低层的神性真理。这从“血”和“坛的底座”的含义清楚可知：“血”是指源于主的神性良善的神性真理，如刚才所述（<a href="10026.htm">10026</a>节）；“坛的底座”是指感官知觉层面，就是人生命的最低层。“坛的底座”之所以具有这种含义，是因为坛是主的神性人身的一个代表；因此，它的底座表示形成人里面生命最低层的东西，而形成人里面生命最低层的东西被称为外在感官知觉，这外在感官知觉就是此处所指的。祭坛是主的神性人身的主要代表（可参看<a href="9388.htm">9388</a>，<a href="9389.htm">9389</a>，<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>，<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节）；其“底座”是指它的最低层，这是显而易见的；至于人里面的这最低层就是外在感官知觉，以及它的性质，可参看前文（<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>，<a href="9996.htm">9996</a>节）。<br />必须简要阐述一下此处是何情形。当一个人正被洁净时，他首先学习诸如能被感官人或人的感官层理解的那类真理；这些就是诸如存在于圣言字义中的那类真理。之后他学习更内在的真理，就是诸如那些拥有启示或光照的人所搜集的那种；因为这些人从解释圣言字义的各个地方搜集圣言的内义。然后，一旦知道这些真理，那些被启示或光照的人就会汲取还要更内在的真理。这些还要更内在的真理，连同前面的真理，作为教义而服务于教会；还要更内在的真理服务于内在教会成员，其它真理则服务于外在教会成员。这两类人只要照这些真理生活，就被提入天堂，加入天使之列，在那里被赋予天使的智慧，这智慧是由还要更内在的真理，最后由第三层天堂的至内在真理产生的。这些真理，连同在自己次序中的之前的真理，都终止于属外在感官知觉的最末和最低层，一起存在于它们里面。由此明显可知，一切内层真理都一起住在圣言字义的真理里面，因为后者是最末和最低层，如前所述。一切内层事物都按次序被储存起来，共同存在于最末和最低的事物里面（参看<a href="9828.htm">9828</a>，<a href="9836.htm">9836</a>节）。由此明显可知当如何理解“把所有的血都倒在坛的底座上”所表示的完全存在于感官知觉层面的神性真理。</p>

And all the blood thou shalt pour out at the base of the altar. That this signifies Divine truth wholly in the sensuous, which is the ultimate of man's life, is evident from the signification of "the 
blood," as being the Divine truth from the Lord's Divine good (on which see just above, n. 10026); and from the signification of "the base of the altar," as being the sensuous which is the ultimate of 
man's life. That the base of the altar has this signification is because the altar was a representative of the Lord's Divine Human, wherefore its base signifies that which is the ultimate of life in 
the human, and the ultimate of life in the human is that which is called the external sensuous, which is here meant. That the altar was the chief representative of the Lord's Divine Human, may be seen 
above (n. 9388, 9389, 9714, 9964); that its base is its ultimate is evident; that this with man is the external sensuous, and what this is, see also above (n. 9212, 9216, 9996).  [2] How the case herein 
is shall be briefly told. When a man is being purified, then first of all are learned such truths as can be apprehended by the sensuous man, such as are the truths in the sense of the letter of 
the Word; afterward are learned more interior truths, such as are collected from the Word by those who are in enlightenment, for these collect its interior sense from various passages where the sense 
of the letter is unfolded. From these, when known, truths still more interior are afterward drawn forth by those who are enlightened, which truths together with the former serve the church for doctrine, 
the more interior truths for doctrine to those who are men of the internal church, the less interior for doctrine to those who are men of the external church. Both the former and the latter men, provided 
they have lived according to these truths, are taken up into heaven among the angels, and are there imbued with angelic wisdom, which is from truths still more interior, and finally is from inmost 
truths in the third heaven. These truths, together with the former in their order, close in the ultimate truths of the external sensuous, and are all together there. From this it is plain that all 
interior truths are together in the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, for these truths, as above said, are the ultimate ones. (That all interior things are stored up in order, and are together 
in ultimates, see n. 9828, 9836.) From all this it is evident what is meant by Divine truth being wholly in the sensuous, which is signified by "all the blood being poured out at the base of the altar." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10028</b></p><p><b>10028.</b>
'And shall pour out all the blood at the base of the altar' means the whole of Divine Truth present on the level of sensory perception, which is the lowest level of life in a person. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'the blood' as Divine Truth springing from the Lord's Divine Good, dealt with just above in <a href="10026.htm">10026</a>; and from the meaning of 'the base of the altar' as the level of sensory perception, 
which is the lowest level of life in a person. 'The base of the altar' has this meaning because the altar was representative of the Lord's Divine Human, and therefore the base of it means that which 
forms the lowest level of life in the human being, and that which forms the lowest level of life in the human being is called outward sensory perception, which is what is meant here. The altar was the 
chief representative of the Lord's Divine Human, see <a href="9388.htm">9388</a>, <a href="9389.htm">9389</a>, <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>, <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>, 'the base', it is self-evident, being the lowest level of it. As regards this level in the human being, that it is outward 
sensory perception, and as regards the nature of it, see <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="9216.htm">9216</a>, <a href="9996.htm">9996</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of all this must be stated briefly. When a person is being purified he first of all learns the kinds 
of truths that someone who thinks on the sensory level can grasp; these are truths such as exist in the literal sense of the Word. Afterwards he learns more internal truths such as are gathered from 
the Word by those who have enlightenment; for these gather its inner meaning from various places where the literal sense there is explained. Then, once these truths are known, even more internal ones 
are taken in by those who have become enlightened. These even more internal truths together with the previous ones serve the Church as doctrinal teachings, the even more internal truths serving members 
of the internal Church, the other truths serving members of the external Church. Both groups of people, if they have led lives in accord with those truths, are raised to heaven among angels, and there 
they are endowed with angelic wisdom, which is the product of truths still more internal, and finally of inmost truths in the third heaven. These truths together with the previous ones in their own 
order terminate in the last and lowest, which belong to outward sensory perception, and exist together within them. From this it is evident that interior truths reside all together in the truths belonging 
to the literal sense of the Word, for the latter are the last and lowest, as has been stated. Within things that are last and lowest those which are more internal ones position themselves all in 
sequence, and within them they exist all together, see <a href="9828.htm">9828</a>, <a href="9836.htm">9836</a>. From this it is evident what should be understood by the whole of Divine Truth present on the level of sensory perception, meant by 
the requirement that all the blood was to be poured out at the base of the altar.  </p>

`Et omnem sanguinem effundes ad fundamentum altaris': quod significet Divinum Verum totum in sensuali, quod ultimum vitae hominis, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' quod sit Divinum Verum ex Divino 
Bono (c)Domini, de qua mox supra n. 10,026, et ex significatione `fundamenti altaris' quod sit sensuale, quod ultimum vitae (o)hominis; quod `fundamentum altaris' id sit {2}, est quia altare fuit 
repraesentativum Divini Humani Domini, quare fundamentum ejus significat id quod ultimum vitae in humano (o)est, ac ultimum vitae in humano est (o)id (x)quod vocatur sensuale (o)externum, quod hic intelligitur; 
quod altare fuerit praecipuum repraesentativum Divini Humani Domini, videatur n. 9388, 9389, 9714, 9964; {3} quod fundamentum sit ultimum ejus, patet; quod id apud hominem sit sensuale externum, 
et quale id {4}, videatur n. 9212, 9216, 9996. 	[2] Quomodo cum his se habet, paucis dicendum est: cum homo purificatur, tunc omnium primum addiscuntur talia vera quae capi possunt a sensuali homine; 
talia vera sunt, qualia sunt {5} in sensu litterae Verbi; postea addiscuntur vera interiora qualia sunt (m)quae colliguntur ex Verbo ab illis qui in illustratione sunt, hi enim colligunt sensum 
interiorem ejus ex variis locis, ubi sensus litterae ibi explicatur; ex his cognitis (o)dein vera adhuc interiora ab illustratis hauriuntur, quae cum prioribus inserviunt Ecclesiae pro doctrina, haec 
pro doctrina illis qui internae Ecclesiae homines sunt, illa pro doctrina illis qui externae Ecclesiae homines sunt; hi et illi, si vixerunt secundum illa, in caelum inter angelos elevantur, ac ibi imbuuntur 
sapientia angelica, quae est ex veris adhuc interioribus, et tandem ex intimis in caelo tertio;(n) haec vera cum prioribus in suo ordine desinunt in ultima, quae sunt sensualis externi, ac ibi 
simul sunt; inde patet quod interiora vera omnia sint simul in veris sensus litterae Verbi, nam haec vera, ut supra dictum est, ultima sunt {6}; quod in ultimis se reponant interiora omnia ordine, et 
ibi simul sint, videatur n. 9828, (x)9836.  Ex his patet quid intelligitur per quod Divinum Verum sit totum in sensuali, quod significatur per quod omnis sanguis effunderetur ad fundamentum altaris. @1
