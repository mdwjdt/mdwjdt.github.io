<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2875节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2875.</strong>生命之善，或对良善的情感是由主在人浑然不觉的情况通过内在途径注入的；而教义真理，或信则是通过外在途径被注入到记忆里面。它被主照自己的时间和自己的秩序从记忆召唤出来，并与对良善的情感结合。这一切是在人自由的状态下进行的，因为如前所述，人的自由来自情感。这就是信的植入和扎根。凡在自由状态下所做的任何事都会与人结合，而在强制状态下所做的事则不会结合。这从以下事实可以看出来：若非人对其有情感，任何事物都不可能与他结合。情感才是那实际接受者，凡违背情感所接受的任何事物都违背他的生命。由此明显可知，教义真理或信若不藉着对它的情感，就无法被接受。不过，情感如何，接受就如何。只有对真理与良善的情感才会接受信之真理，因为它们彼此一致；并且它们因一致而结合在一起。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2875</b></p><p><b>2875.</b>
The good of life, or the affection of good, is insinuated by the Lord by an internal way, without man's knowing anything about it; but the truth of doctrine, or faith, by an external way, into the memory, 
whence it is called forth by the Lord in His own time and according to His own order, and is conjoined with the affection of good. This is done in man's freedom; for as before said, man's freedom 
is from affection. Such is the insemination and inrooting of faith. Whatever is done in freedom is conjoined, but that which is done under compulsion is not conjoined; as may be seen from considering 
that by no possibility can anything be conjoined except that by which we are affected: affection is the very thing that receives; to receive anything contrary to the affection is to receive it contrary 
to the life. Hence it is manifest that truth of doctrine, or faith, cannot be received except by the affection of it. But such as is the affection, such is the reception. It is only the affection 
of truth and good that receives the truth of faith; for they agree, and because they agree, they conjoin themselves together. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2875</b></p><p><b>2875.</b>
Goodness of life, or the affection for good, is instilled by the Lord by means of an internal way, without the person being at all aware of it, whereas the truth of doctrine, or faith, is instilled by 
an external way and introduced into the memory. From there it is called forth by the Lord in His own time and according to His own order and is joined to the affection for good. This happens in that 
person's freedom, for a person's freedom, as has been stated, flows from his affection. This is how faith is implanted and takes root. Whatever is done in freedom is joined to him, but that which is 
done under compulsion is not. This may become clear from the fact that nothing can possibly be joined to a person unless he has an affection for it. Affection is that which actually receives, and anything 
received that is contrary to his affection is contrary to his life. From this it is evident that the truth of doctrine, or faith, is incapable of being received except by the affection for it. But 
as is the affection so is the reception. It is the affection for truth and good, this alone, that receives the truth of faith, for they accord with each other, and because they accord they join themselves 
together. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2875</b>
</p><b>2875.</b>
Bonum vitae seu affectio boni insinuatur a Domino per viam internam, homine prorsus nesciente, verum doctrinae autem seu fides per viam externam, et infertur memoriae, inde a Domino suo tempore et suo 
ordine evocatur, et affectioni boni conjungitur; hoc fit in libero hominis, nam liberum hominis est, ut dictum, ex affectione; talis est inseminatio et irradicatio fidei:  quicquid fit in libero, hoc 
conjungitur, quod autem fit in coacto, non conjungitur; quod constare potest ex eo quod nequicquam aliquid conjungi possit nisi quo afficitur; affectio est ipsum recipiens; contra affectionem aliquid 
recipere, est contra vitam; inde patet quod verum doctrinae seu fides non recipi queat nisi ab affectione ejus; sed qualis affectio, talis receptio; affectio veri et boni est solum quae recipit verum 
fidei, concordant enim, et, quia concordant, se conjungunt. </p>
