<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9967节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9967.</strong>后来，我被主带到宇宙中的一个星球，这个星球距离我们地球比前面章节末尾所论述的第一个星球还要遥远。我被允许通过以下事实明显知道它离得更远：就我的灵而言，我被带到那里花了两天时间。这个星球在左边，而前一个星球在右边。在来世，遥远并非由空间距离，而是由状态的不同造成的；然而，这在那里产生了空间遥远的表象，如前所述（<a href="9440.htm">9440</a>节）。因此，从到那里所花的时间，也就是两天的时间，我能推断出那些人的内层状态，也就是情感和随之思维的状态，在同等程度上不同于我们地球灵的内层状态。就我的灵而言，我通过内层状态的变化而被送到那里，所以被允许记录在到达那里之前一个接一个发生的实际变化。这一切都是在我完全清醒的时候发生的。</p>

CONCERNING THE SECOND EARTH SEEN IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. I was afterward led by the Lord to an earth in the universe which was at a greater distance from our earth than that first one which was treated 
of at the end of some of the former chapters. That it was further distant was given me to know from the fact that I was two days being led thither as to my spirit. This earth was to the left; but the 
former was to the right. Remoteness in the other life does not arise from distance of place; but from difference of state, which nevertheless appears there like distance of place (according to what 
was said above, n. 9440). Wherefore from the time it took to get there, which as already said was two days, I was able to infer that the state of the interiors with those people - which is the state of 
the affections and the consequent thoughts - differed from the state of the interiors with the spirits from our earth in the same proportion. As I was conveyed thither in respect to the spirit by means 
of changes of state of the interiors, it was given me to note the successive changes themselves, before I arrived there. This took place while I was awake. </p>

THE SECOND PLANET OUT IN SPACE WHICH I HAVE SEEN  </p>
<p>Afterwards I was taken by the Lord to a planet in the universe which was further away from ours than the first dealt with at the ends of several foregoing 
chapters. I was allowed to know that it was further away by the fact that it took two days to convey me there as to my spirit. This planet lay to the left, but the first to the right. Lying further 
away in the next life is not due to spatial remoteness but to difference of state, which however produces there the appearance of a spatial remoteness, in accord with what has been stated previously 
in <a href="9440.htm">9440</a>. From the time therefore that it took to get there, which was two days, as has just been said, I was able to deduce that the state of the interiors with those people, that is, the state 
of affections and consequent thoughts, was in like measure different from the state of the interiors that exists with spirits from our planet. And since I was conveyed there as to my spirit by means of 
changes of the state of the interiors I was allowed to note the actual changes taking place one after another before arrival there. This happened when I was wide awake.  </p>

De Secunda Tellure visa in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Postea ductus sum a Domino ad tellurem in universo, quae distabat a nostra tellure longinquius quam prima illa, de qua ad finem capitum aliquot priorum 
actum est; quod distaret longinquius, scire datum est ex eo quod illuc quoad spiritum meum deductus sim per binos dies; erat illa tellus ad sinistrum, prior autem ad dextrum. Longinquitas in altera vita 
non est ex distantia loci sed ex differentia status, quae tamen usque apparet ibi sicut distantia loci, secundum illa quae prius n. 9440 dicta sunt; quapropter ex mora progressionis illuc, quae erat, 
ut dictum, duorum dierum, concludere potui quod status interiorum apud illos, qui est status affectionum et inde cogitationum, tantum differret a statu interiorum, qui est apud spiritus e nostra tellure. 
Quoniam perlatus sum illuc quoad spiritum per mutationes status interiorum, ideo datum est observare ipsas mutationes successivas antequam illuc perventum est. Factum est hoc cum vigil eram. </p>
