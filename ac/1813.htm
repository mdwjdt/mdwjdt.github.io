<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1813节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1813.</strong>“耶和华就以此算他为义”表主在其中第一次成为公义。这也可从内义上事件的连贯性清楚看出来，就内义而言，所论述的主题是主。唯独主为了整个人类而成为公义，这从以下事实可以看出来：祂唯独出于神性之爱争战，也就是说，出于对整个人类的爱争战。整个人类的救赎就是祂在其争战中为之渴望和燃烧的。就其人性本质而言，主并非生来就是公义，而是通过试探的争战变成公义，并且祂是凭自己的力量做到这一点的。每当祂争战并得胜，这就算祂为义，即添加到祂所成为的义上，这公义从而不断增长，直到祂成为完全的公义。<br />从人父所生，或从人父之种所生的人为自己争战。他不可能出于其它爱，只会出于我欲和物欲，因而不会出于天堂之爱，而是出于地狱之爱争战。因为这就是除了他通过自己的行为所获得的自我外，他从其父那里所得来的自我的性质。所以，人若以为他凭自己与魔鬼争战，就大错特错了。同样，若他渴望凭自己的力量使自己成为公义，也就是说，相信仁之善和信之真出于他自己，因而通过它们配得上天堂，那么其行为和想法就违背信之善与真。因为信之真理，即真理本身就是，主才是争战的那一位。由于他的行为和想法违背信之真理，故他将主的东西从主那里夺走，并据为己有。或也可说，他取代了主的位置，从而将地狱置于自己里面。正因如此，这种人渴望在天堂成为大的，或最大的。也正因如此，他们错误地以为主与地狱争战是为了祂可以成为最大的。人的自我就具有这类错觉，这些错觉表面看似真理，但其实恰恰相反。<br />主降世是为了成为公义，唯独祂是公义，先知们早就预言了这一点。因此，甚至在祂到来之前就知道这一点，还知道祂若非藉着针对一切邪恶和一切地狱的试探和胜利就无法成为公义，是有可能的。如耶利米书：<br />在祂的日子，犹大必得救，以色列也安然居住。这是祂的名，他们必称祂为耶和华我们的义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">23:6</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />当那日子，那时候，我必使大卫公义的苗裔长起来，祂必在地上施行公平和公义。在那日子，犹大必得救，耶路撒冷必安然居住，他们必称祂为耶和华我们的义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />祂见无人，竟无一人代求，甚为诧异，就用自己的膀臂拯救祂，以公义扶持祂。祂以公义为铠甲，以拯救为头盔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">59:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.17.htm">17</a>）<br />尤其参看以赛亚书63:3，5。“自己的膀臂”表祂自己的力量。由于唯独主是公义，故耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.23.htm">31:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.7.htm">50:7</a>）中还提及“公义的居所”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1813.</strong> And [Jehovah] credited it to him as uprightness means that at that juncture the Lord first came to embody uprightness, as can also be seen from the inner-sense train of thought, which has to do with the Lord.<br />The Lord alone became the epitome of uprightness, on behalf of the whole human race. The evidence for this is that he alone fought out of divine love, which is love for the whole human race, whose salvation was the one thing he sought (and sought ardently) in his battles.<br />In respect to his human side, the Lord was not born a model of uprightness, or justice, but became one by fighting his battles and winning them, and doing so under his own power. Every time he fought and won, he was given credit for being upright. That is, it contributed bit by bit to his transformation into a model of justice, until finally he became pure justice.<br />[2] When those of us born to human parents — of a human father's seed — fight on our own, we are incapable of fighting from any other love than self-love and love of the material world. So we do not then fight from heavenly but hellish love. This is the nature of the self-centeredness we inherit from our parents, as well as that which we develop on our own by the way we live. So if we think we can fight the Devil on our own, we are grossly mistaken.<br />The same goes for people who try to become virtuous on the strength of their own abilities. These are people who imagine that they generate their own charitable efforts and think up their own religious truth and who therefore see these efforts and this truth as earning them heaven. Such people violate religious goodness and truth in deed and thought, because what religion truly teaches — the truth itself — is that the Lord does the fighting. Because they violate religious truth in deed and thought, they deny the Lord his role and take it for themselves; or to put it another way, they install themselves and their own hellish tendencies in the Lord's place. That is why they want to become great in heaven, or even the greatest there. That is also why they falsely believe the Lord fought the hells to become the greatest. Our self-absorbed point of view carries with it these delusions that seem so true but are exactly the opposite.<br />[3] The prophets foretold that the Lord would come into the world to become the epitome of uprightness — a role that is his alone — so this could have been known before his Coming. The prophets also revealed that he could not become the epitome of uprightness, or justice, without being tested by all evil and all the hells and winning victories over them. In Jeremiah, for example:<br />In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live securely, and this is his name that they will call him: Jehovah our justice. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_6" target=_top>Jeremiah 23:6</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />In those days and at that time, I will make an offshoot of justice sprout for David, and he will perform judgment and justice in the land. In those days, Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live securely. And this is what they will call him: Jehovah our justice. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_33_15-16" target=_top>Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />He looked, and there was no man, and he was astounded that no one was interceding; and his arm achieved salvation for him, and his justice sustained him. And he put justice on like a coat of armor, and a helmet of salvation on his head. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_59_16-17" target=_top>Isaiah 59:16-17</a>; see especially <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_3" target=_top>Isaiah 63:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />His arm stands for his own power.<br />As the Lord alone embodied justice, he is also called the dwelling place of justice (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_23" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1813/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_50_7" target=_top>50:7</a>). </p>

He imputed it to him for righteousness. That this signifies that herein the Lord first became righteousness, may also be seen from the connection of things in the internal sense, in which the Lord is 
treated of. That the Lord alone became righteousness for the whole human race, may be seen from the fact that He alone fought from Divine love, namely, from love toward the whole human race, whose salvation 
was what in His combats He solely desired and burned for. In regard to His Human Essence the Lord was not born righteousness, but became righteousness through combats of temptations and victories, 
and this from His own power. As often as He fought and overcame, this was imputed to Him for righteousness, that is, it was added to the righteousness that He was becoming, as a continual increase, 
until He became pure righteousness.  [2] A man who is born of a human father, or of the seed of a human father, when fighting from himself cannot fight from any other love than the love of self and 
of the world, thus not from heavenly love, but from infernal love, for such is the character of his Own from his father, in addition to the Own acquired by his own conduct. Therefore he who supposes 
that he fights from himself against the devil is hugely mistaken. In like manner he who desires to make himself righteous by his own powers-that is, to believe that the goods of charity and the truths 
of faith are from himself, consequently that he merits heaven by them-acts and thinks against the good and truth of faith; for it is a truth of faith, that is, it is the truth itself, that the Lord 
fights. And therefore because he then acts and thinks against the truth of faith, he takes away from the Lord what is His, and makes what is the Lord's to be his own, or what is the same, he puts himself 
in the Lord's place, and thereby puts that which is infernal in himself. Hence it is that such men desire to become great, or the greatest, in heaven; and hence it is that they falsely believe that 
the Lord fought against the hells in order that He might be the greatest. What is man's own is attended with such phantasies,, which appear as if they were truths, but are just the reverse.  [3] That 
the Lord came into the world in order to become righteousness, and that He alone is righteousness, was also foretold by the prophets; and therefore this could have been known before His coming; and 
also that He could not become righteousness except through temptations, and victories over all evils and all the hells. As in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell 
in confidence, and this is His name whereby they shall call Him, Jehovah our righteousness (Jer. 23:6). In the same: </p>
<p>     In those days and in that time will I cause an Offshoot of righteousness to 
grow onto David, and He shall do judgment and righteousness in the land. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in confidence; and this is what they shall call Him, Jehovah our 
righteousness (Jer. 33:15-16). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He saw, and there was no man; and He wondered that there was none to intercede; and His arm brought salvation unto Him, and His righteousness it upheld 
Him. And He put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon His head (Isa. 59:16-17; see especially Isa. 63:3, 5). "His arm" means His own power. Because the Lord alone is righteousness, 
the "habitation of righteousness" also is mentioned in Jeremiah 31:23; 50:7. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1813</b></p><p><b>1813.</b>
'He reckoned it to him as righteousness' means that in this the Lord first became righteousness. This too becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal sense, in which the Lord is the subject. 
That the Lord alone became righteousness for the sake of the whole human race becomes clear from the consideration that He alone has fought out of Divine Love, that is to say, out of love towards 
the whole human race, whose salvation, that and nothing else, He desired and longed for in His conflicts. The Lord was not born righteousness as regards the Human Essence but became righteousness through 
the conflicts brought about by temptations and through victories, something He achieved by His own power. And as often as He fought and won the victory, this was reckoned to Him as righteousness, 
that is, it was added to the righteousness He was becoming, as an increase to it every time, until He became perfect righteousness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When one who is begotten from a human father, that is, from the 
seed of a human father, fights for himself, he cannot possibly do so out of any other love than love of self and love of the world, thus not out of heavenly love but out of hellish, for such is the 
nature of the proprium he possesses from his father in addition to the proprium he has acquired by his own actions. Consequently the person who imagines that he fights the devil from himself is grossly 
mistaken. So too the person who wishes to make himself righteous by his own powers, that is, to believe that the goods of charity and the truths of faith come from himself, and consequently to merit 
heaven through them, is acting and thinking contrary to the good and truth of faith. For it is a truth of faith, that is, it is the truth itself, that the Lord is the one who does battle. Thus because 
he is acting and thinking contrary to a truth of faith, he deprives the Lord of what is His and makes what is the Lord's his own; or what amounts to the same, he replaces the Lord with himself and 
so with that in himself which is from hell. It is for this reason that people wish to become great or the greatest in heaven, and thus it is that they believe quite wrongly that the Lord fought against 
the hells so that He might be the greatest. The human proprium has delusions such as these within it which have all the appearance of being truths but which are quite the reverse. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That the Lord 
came into the world so as to become righteousness, and that He alone is righteousness, was also foretold by the Prophets. Thus it was possible to know of this even before His Coming, and also to know 
that He could not become righteousness except by means of temptations and victories over all evils and over all the hells, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell 
with confidence. And this is His name which they will call Him. Jehovah our Righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
In those days and at that time I will cause a shoot of righteousness to 
sprout forth for David, and he will execute judgement and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell with confidence. And this is what they will call Him, Jehovah 
our Righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2033:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 33:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He saw and there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor, and His own arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness upheld 
Him. And He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon His head. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And see especially <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:3,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:3, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
'His own arm' stands for His own power. Since the Lord 
alone is righteousness, the expression a habitation of righteousness is also used, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:23;%2050:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:23; 50:7</a>. </p>

Quod 'imputavit illud ipsi in justitiam' significet quod Dominus justitia in hoc primum factus, constare quoque potest ex serie rerum in sensu interno, in quo de Domino agitur: quod Dominus solus justitia 
factus pro universo genere humano, constare potest ex illo quod Ipse solus pugnavit ex Divino Amore, nempe ex amore erga universum genus humanum, cujus salutem in pugnis suis unice desideravit 
et flagravit.  Dominus non natus est justitia quoad Humanam Essentiam, sed factus est justitia per pugnas tentationum et victorias, et hoc ex propria potentia; et quoties pugnavit et vicit, Ipsi hoc imputatum 
est in justitiam, hoc est, additum justitiae quae fieret, continue ut incrementum, usque dum pura justitia factus.  [2] Homo qui a patre homine, seu a semine hominis patris nascitur, nusquam 
ex alio amore pugnare potest dum ex se, quam ex amore sui et mundi, ita non ex amore caelesti, sed ex infernali; nam proprium ejus a patre, praeter proprium a se actualiter acquisitum, tale est; quare 
qui putat ex se pugnare contra diabolum, enormiter fallitur; similiter qui se justum facere vult propriis viribus, hoc est, credere quod bona charitatis et vera fidei sint ex semet, consequenter per 
illa mereri caelum, is contra bonum et verum fidei agit et cogitat; nam verum fidei, hoc est, ipsa veritas est quod Dominus pugnet; sic quia contra verum fidei tunc agit et cogitat, Domino derogat quod 
Ipsius est, et quod Domini est, suum facit, aut quod idem est, semet loco Domini substituit, ita id apud se quod infernale est; inde est quod velint magni seu maximi fieri in caelo; et inde est quod 
false credant quod Dominus pugnaverit contra inferna ut maximus esset; proprium humanum secum habet tales phantasias, quae apparent tanquam forent veritates, sed prorsus contrarium est.  [3] Quod Dominus 
in mundum venerit ut fieret justitia, et quod sit solus justitia, etiam a Prophetis praedictum est; ita hoc notum potuit esse ante Adventum Ipsius; tum quod aliter justitia non fieri potuerit quam 
per tentationes et victorias super omnia mala et omnia inferna; ut apud Jeremiam, 	In diebus Ipsius salvabitur Jehudah, et Israel habitabit confidenter; et hoc nomen Ipsius, quod appellabunt Ipsum, 
Jehovah justitia nostra, xxiii 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	In diebus illis, et in tempore illo, germinare faciam Davidi germen justitiae, et faciet judicium et justitiam in terra: in diebus illis salvabitur Jehudah, 
et Hierosolyma habitabit confidenter: hoc autem quod appellabunt Illum, Jehovah justitia nostra, xxxiii 15, 16: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Vidit, et non vir, et obstupuit quod non intercedens, et salutem 
praestitit Ipsi brachium Ipsius, et justitia ipsius fulcivit Ipsum; et induit justitiam sicut loricam, et galeam salutis super caput Suum, lix 16, (x)17; </p>
<p>videatur imprimis Esai. lxiii 3, 5; 'brachium 
Ipsius' pro potentia propria: quia Dominus solus justitia, etiam dicitur 'habitaculum justitiae,' Jer. xxxi 23; l 7. </p>
