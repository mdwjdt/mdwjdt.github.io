<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2527节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2527．创世记20:6.</strong> 神在梦中对他说，是的，我知道你作这事是心中正直，我也拦阻了你，免得你得罪我，所以我不容许你接触她。<br />“神在梦中对他说”表不那么模糊的直觉。“是的，我知道你作这事是心中正直”在此和前面一样，表这种想法是出于纯真简单的良善，因而是无可指摘的。“我也拦阻了你，免得你得罪我”表没有造成伤害。“所以我不容许你接触她”表根本不请教理性。</p>

Verse 6. And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the uprightness of thy heart thou hast done this; and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me; therefore I did not suffer thee to 
touch her. "God said unto him in the dream," signifies perception less obscure; "Yea, I know that in the uprightness of thy heart thou hast done this," signifies here as before that it was so thought 
from innocence and from simple good; thus that there was no fault; "and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me," signifies that no harm resulted; "therefore I did not suffer thee to touch her," 
signifies that the rational was not at all consulted. </p>

Verse 6 And God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the uprightness of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not allow you to touch 
her. </p>
<p>'God said to him in the dream' means a perception that was less obscure. 'Yes, I know that in the uprightness of your heart you have done this' means here, as previously, that such thinking was 
the product of innocence and of simple good, thus that there was nothing worthy of blame. 'And I also withheld you from sinning against Me' means nothing harmful had taken place. 'Therefore I did not 
allow you to touch her' means that the rational was not consulted at all. </p>

</p><b>2527.</b>
Vers. 6.  Et dixit ad eum Deus in somnio, Etiam Ego novi, quod in rectitudine cordis tui feceris hoc, et prohibui etiam Ego te a peccando Mihi, propterea non dedi tibi ad attingendum ad illam `Dixit 
ad eum Deus in somnio' significat perceptionem minus obscuram: `etiam Ego novi quod in rectitudine cordis tui feceris hoc' significat, hic ut prius, quod ita cogitatum ex innocentia et ex simplici bono, 
ita quod non in culpa: `et prohibui etiam Ego te a peccando Mihi' significat quod nihil noxae illatum: `propterea non dedi tibi ad attingendum ad illam' significat quod nihil rationale consultum. </p>
