<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3798节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3798.</strong>“（雅各）就上前把石头从井口滚开”表主凭属世良善揭开圣言的内层事物。这从“雅各”的代表和“把石头从井口滚开”的含义清楚可知：如前所示，“雅各”是指主的神性属世层，在此是指这属世层里面的良善；“把石头从井口滚开”是指揭开圣言的内层事物（<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>，<a href="3771.htm">3771</a>，<a href="3773.htm">3773</a>，<a href="3789.htm">3789</a>节）。此处的至高意义之所以表示主凭属世良善揭开圣言的内层事物，是因为“雅各”在此代表属世层里面的良善。雅各成了良善的代表，因为现在真理要通过拉结所代表的情感（参看<a href="3775.htm">3775</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>节）与它联结；圣言的内层事物正是凭良善被揭开（<a href="3773.htm">3773</a>节）。<br />显而易见，圣言凭良善被揭开。<br />每个人都是通过自己里面的爱来看待属于那爱的事物；并且他将自己所看到的称为真理，因为它们与那和谐一致。每个人的爱都含有其生命之光在里面，因为爱就像发光的火焰。所以，人之爱的性质就决定了其真理之光的性质。那些处于善之爱的人能看到属于这爱的事物，从而看到圣言里面的真理，并且是照着其善之爱的量和质来看的。因为在这种情况下，光或聪明从天堂流入，也就是经由天堂从主流入。这就是为何如前所述，除了生命由良善主导的人之外，没有人能看到并承认圣言的内层事物。</p>

That Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth. That this signifies that the Lord from natural good uncovered the Word as to things interior, is evident from the representation of Jacob, 
as being the Lord's Divine natural, as before shown, here, in respect to the good therein; and from the signification of "rolling the stone from the well's mouth," as being to uncover the Word in 
respect to its interiors (n. 3769, 3771, 3773, 3789). The reason why the supreme internal sense here is that the Lord from natural good uncovered the Word as to its interiors, is that Jacob here represents 
good in the natural; for Jacob puts on the representation of good, because now truth was to be adjoined thereto by means of the affection which Rachel represents (see just above, n. 3775, 3793); 
and because it is from good that the Word is uncovered in respect to its interiors (n. 3773). That it is from good that the Word is uncovered is very manifest, because it is from the love in which 
each man is that he sees the things which are of that love, and that which he sees he calls truths, because they are in agreement with that love. There is in each man's love the light of his life, for 
love is like a flame from which light issues; such therefore as is the love or flame, such is the man's light of truth. They who are in the love of good can see that which is of this love, consequently 
the truths that are in the Word, and this in accordance with the amount and the quality of their love of good; for in this case light or intelligence flows in from heaven, that is, through heaven from 
the Lord. For this reason it is that as before said no one can see and acknowledge the interiors of the Word unless he is in good as to life. </p>

That Jacob came near and rolled the stone from over the mouth of the well' means that the Lord, by virtue of natural good, disclosed the interior contents of the Word. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Jacob' as the Lord's Divine Natural, dealt with already, here as regards the good in it, and from the meaning of 'rolling the stone from over the mouth of the well' as disclosing the interior 
contents of the Word, dealt with in <a href="3769.htm">3769</a>, <a href="3771.htm">3771</a>, <a href="3773.htm">3773</a>, <a href="3789.htm">3789</a>. The reason why the highest sense here means that the Lord by virtue of natural good disclosed the interior contents of the Word is that 'Jacob' 
here represents good within the Natural. For Jacob takes on the representation of good because truth had now to be allied to it through the affection which 'Rachel' represents, see just above in <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>; and it is by virtue of good that the interior contents of the Word are disclosed, <a href="3773.htm">3773</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is plainly evident that the Word is disclosed by virtue of good. Everyone looks from the 
love present in him at the things that belong to that love; and what he sees he calls truths because these are in harmony with it. Everyone's love holds the light of his life within it, for love is like 
a flame which radiates light. The nature of a person's love or flame therefore determines that of the light of truth with him. Those who are stirred by a love of good are able to see the things belonging 
to that love, and so to see the truths that are in the Word. They do so according to the amount and the quality of their love of good, for light or intelligence flows in from heaven, that is, 
from the Lord by way of heaven. This is why, as already stated, no one is able to see and acknowledge the interior contents of the Word except one whose life is governed by good. </p>

</p><b>3798.</b>
`Et accessit Jacob, et devolvit lapidem a super ore putei' quod significet Dominum ex bono naturali retexisse Verbum quoad interiora, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit Divinum Naturale 
Domini, de qua prius, hic quoad bonum ibi; et ex significatione `devolvere lapidem a super ore putei' quod sit retegere Verbum quoad interiora, de qua n. 3769, 3771, 3773, 3789.  Quod sensus internus 
supremus hic sit quod Dominus ex bono naturali retexerit Verbum quoad interiora, est quia per `Jacobum' hic repraesentatur bonum in Naturali, induit enim Jacob repraesentationem boni, quia ei 
nunc adjungendum est verum per affectionem quam `Rachel' repraesentat, videatur mox supra n. 3775, 3793, et quod ex bono retegatur Verbum quoad ejus interiora, n. (x)3773; [2] quod ex bono retegatur 
Verbum, patet manifeste; </p>
<p>unusquisque ex amore in quo est, videt illa quae amoris illius (x)sunt, et quae videt, vocat vera quia consentanea ei; est in amore cujusvis lux vitae ejus, amor enim se 
habet sicut flamma ex qua lux; qualis itaque amor seu flamma, talis est ei lux veri; qui in amore boni sunt, videre possunt quae illius amoris sunt, proinde vera quae in Verbo, et haec quantum et qualiter 
in amore boni sunt, influit enim tunc e caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino (o)lux seu intelligentia; inde est quod, sicut prius dictum, nemo possit videre et agnoscere interiora Verbi nisi 
qui in bono est quoad vitam. </p>
