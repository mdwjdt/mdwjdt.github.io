<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4443节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4443.</strong>“雅各的儿子们就从田野回来”表他们基于其宗教表象进行商讨。这从“雅各的儿子们”和“田野”的含义清楚可知：“雅各的儿子们”是指源于他们的民族，教会的代表就建在这个民族中间；“田野”是指宗教表象（参看<a href="4440.htm">4440</a>节）。“从田野回来”表示基于宗教表象的商议，这一点从思维的顺序，以及以下事实可推知：动词“来”就论及他们的宗教表象。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4443</b></p><p><b>4443.</b>
And the sons of Jacob came from the field. That this signifies that they consulted from their religiosity, is evident from the signification of the "sons of Jacob," as being the nation derived from them, 
among whom there was instituted the representative of a church; and from the signification of a "field," as being a religiosity (see n. 4440). That "to come from the field" denotes consultation from 
the religiosity, follows from the series, as also from the fact that it is their religiosity of which "coming" is predicated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4443</b></p><p><b>4443.</b>
'And Jacob's sons came from the field' means that the counsel they took was based in their semblance of religion. This is clear from the meaning of 'the sons of Jacob' as the nation descended from them, 
among whom a representative of the Church was established, and from the meaning of 'the field' as their semblance of religion, dealt with above in <a href="4440.htm">4440</a>. The fact that 'coming' from there means consultation 
based on this follows from the sequence of thought, and also from the fact that it is their semblance of religion to which the verb 'coming' has reference. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4443</b>
</p><b>4443.</b>
`Et filii Jacobi venerunt ab agro': quod significet quod consultaverint ex religioso suo, constat ex significatione `filiorum Jacobi' quod sit gens quae ab illis, apud quam repraesentativum Ecclesiae 
institutum est; et ex significatione agri' quod sit religiosum, de qua supra n. 4440, a quo `venire' quod sit consultatio ex illo, sequitur ex serie, tum etiam ex eo quod religiosum eorum' sit, 
de qua praedicatur `venire.' </p>
