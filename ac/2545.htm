<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2545节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2545.</strong>“亚比米勒召了亚伯拉罕来，对他说”表主出于信之教义的思维。这从“亚比米勒”和“亚伯拉罕”的代表，以及前面多次解释的“说”的含义清楚可知。至于出于信之教义的思维是什么，这是无法理性解释清楚的，因为对这个问题的洞察只能落入天使的观念中。然而，它在这些观念中将自身连同天堂的代表物一起呈现在如此的大光之中，以致几乎无法对它作出任何描述。若不在天使观念中，就不能洞察这个问题；当我们说主的思维来自智性真理时，这一点是显而易见的。智性真理远在理性之上，主通过智性真理看待理性；不过，祂通过直觉思考，而这直觉来自神性真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2545</b></p><p><b>2545.</b>
Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him. That this signifies the Lord's thought from the doctrine of faith, is evident from the representation of Abimelech, and also of Abraham, and from the signification 
of "saying," which have all been explained several times. What it is to think from the doctrine of faith cannot be explained to the apprehension; for the perception of this can fall into angelic 
ideas only; but to these it is presented in a light so great, attended with heavenly representatives, that scarcely anything of it can be described; as is evident when we say that the Lord's thought 
was from intellectual truth, which was above that rational which He looked upon therefrom; but that the perception from which He thought was from Divine truth. </p>

'Abimelech called Abraham and said to him' means the Lord's thought from the doctrine of faith. This becomes clear from the representation of 'Abimelech', and also of 'Abraham', and from the meaning 
of 'saying', dealt with several times already. No intelligible explanation of what thinking from the doctrine of faith is can be given because the perception of this matter cannot fall into any but angelic 
ideas, yet within these it presents itself in so much light, together with heavenly representatives, that scarcely anything of it can be described. The inability to perceive this matter except within 
angelic ideas is made evident when it is said that the Lord's thought was from intellectual truth, which was above the rational which He looked upon from that truth, but that His perception from 
which He thought was from Divine Truth. </p>

</p><b>2545.</b>
`Vocavit Abimelech Abrahamum et dixit illi': quo significet cogitationem Domini ex doctrina fidei, constare potest ex repraesentatione `Abimelechi,' tum `Abrahami,' et a significatione `dicere,' de 
quibus aliquoties prius.  Quid sit cogitare ex doctrina fidei, non potest ad captum exponi, nam perceptio ejus rei non cadere potest quam in ideas angelicas, quibus id sistitur in tanta luce cum repraesentativis 
caelestibus ut vix aliquid describi possit; ut constare potest, si diceretur quod cogitatio fuerit ex intellectualia vero, quod supra rationale quod inde spectavit; sed quod perceptio ex qua 
cogitavit, fuerit ex Divino Vero. </p>
