<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7768节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7768.</strong>“他打发一切去的时候，一定把你们从这里赶出去”表他们将彻底离开他们，憎恶他们，并避开他们的出现。这从“打发一切去”和“他把你们赶出去”的含义清楚可知：“打发一切去”是指彻底离开；“他把你们赶出去”是指憎恶并避开他们所侵扰的那些属于属灵教会的人。因为凡憎恶某人出现的人也避开他的出现，同样会把他从自己身边赶走。他们现在之所以憎恶并避开那些属于属灵教会的人，是因为所流入的良善和真理现在折磨他们。此中情形就像痛疮忍受不了温水的触摸，或空气的呼吸；或像受伤的眼睛甚至无法忍受柔和的阳光。这类灵人的属世心智现在就像这种疮；因为他们经历荒凉之后，也就是属于信的事物被弃绝之后，当良善或真理最细微的气息吹到他们身上时，他们就会感到疼痛，憎恶由此而来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7768</b></p><p><b>7768.</b>
When he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence. That this signifies that they will leave them completely, and will hold them in aversion and shun their presence, is evident from 
the signification of "to let everything go," as being to leave completely; and from the signification of "driving he shall drive you out," as being to hold in aversion and shun those who are of the 
spiritual church whom they had infested; for he who holds in aversion the presence of anyone, also shuns his presence, and likewise drives him away from him. That they now hold in aversion and shun those 
who are of the spiritual church, is because the good and the truth which flow in, now torment them. The case herein is like that of painful ulcers which do not endure even the touch of warm water 
or a breath of air; or like that of an injured eye which cannot bear even the mild rays of the sun. The natural mind of such spirits is now such a sore; for after they have been vastated, that is, after 
the things that had been of faith have been rejected, they suffer at the least breath of good and truth, whence comes aversion. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7768</b></p><p><b>7768.</b>
'When he sends everything away he will surely drive you out from here' means that they will leave them completely, and will loathe and shun their presence. This is clear from the meaning of 'sending 
everything away 'as leaving completely; and from the meaning of 'surely driving you out' as loathing and shunning those belonging to the spiritual Church whom they have molested. For anyone who loathes 
another's presence shuns it too, and also drives him away from himself.  The reason why they now loathe and shun those who belong to the spiritual Church is that inflowing goodness and truth now torment 
them. The situation may be compared to painful sores which cannot stand even the touch of warm water or a breath of air on them, or to a damaged eye that cannot stand even gentle rays from the sun. 
So it is with those who molest. Their natural mind is now like something wounded in this way; after they have undergone vastation, that is, after things which have been matters of faith have been cast 
away, they feel pain when the slightest breath of goodness or truth blows on them, which gives rise to loathing. </p>

</p><b>7768.</b>
`Sicut dimittere illum omne, expellendo expellet vos abhinc': quod significet quod relinquent plane, ac aversabuntur et fugient praesentiam illorum, constat ex significatione `dimittere omne' quod sit 
relinquere plane; et ex significatione `expellendo expellere vos' quod sit aversari et fugere illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quos infestarunt; qui enim aversatur praesentiam alicujus, etiam fugit 
illam, {1}et quoque a se expellit illum.  Quod nunc aversentur et fugiant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, est quia bonum (c)et verum quae {2} influunt nunc cruciant illos; se habent illa sicut {3}ulcera 
dolorifica, quae ne quidem {4}tactum tepentis aquae, aut aspiratum aeris sufferunt, aut sicut oculus laesus non radios etiam lenes solis; ita apud infestantes, mens eorum naturalis tale saucium 
nunc est, nam postquam vastati sunt, hoc est, postquam rejecta sunt illa quae fuerunt fidei, {5}tunc dolent ad minimum aspiratum boni et veri, inde aversatio {6}. 	@1 is apparet sibi expellere cum ipse 
expellitur, reciprocum enim sistit illam apparentiam$ 	@2 i a praesentia eorum$ 	@3 vulnera$ 	@4 aspiratum$ 	@5 dolet id$ 	@6 i nunc$ </p>
