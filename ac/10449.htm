<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10449</strong>.出埃及记32:15-20.摩西转身，从山上下来，两块法版在他手里；这版是两面写的，它们写在这面和那面。版是神的工作，字是神写的，刻在版上。约书亚听见百姓呼喊的噪音，就对摩西说，在营里有战争的噪音。摩西说，这不是打胜仗叫喊的噪音，也不是打败仗的噪音；我所听见的，乃是悲惨喊叫的噪音。摩西走近营前，就看见牛犊，又看见跳舞；摩西便因怒气发热，把两块版从手中扔出去，在山下摔碎了。又拿来他们所造的牛犊用火焚烧，磨得粉碎，撒在水面上，叫以色列人喝。<br />“摩西转身，从山上下来”表从天堂被送下来的圣言。“两块法版在他手里”表具体和总体的主的圣言。“这版是两面写的，它们写在这面和那面”表通过它，主与人类结合，或天堂与世界结合。“版是神的工作，字是神写的，刻在版上”表圣言的外在意义和内在意义来自神性，是神性真理。“约书亚听见百姓呼喊的噪音”表对这个民族的内层品质的深思和辨别。“就对摩西说，在营里有战争的噪音”表通过来自地狱的虚假和邪恶向天堂和教会的真理和良善发起的攻击。“摩西说，这不是打胜仗叫喊的噪音，也不是打败仗的噪音”表天堂从这一边行动，地狱从那一边行动，因而虚假反对真理，真理反对虚假。“我所听见的，乃是悲惨喊叫的噪音”表他们内层的可悲状态。“摩西走近营前”表地狱，那时这个民族就在其中。“就看见牛犊，又看见跳舞”表地狱的敬拜，这敬拜与这个民族外在的爱之快乐，以及他们的内层庆祝的渴望是一致的。“摩西便因怒气发热”表这个民族背离圣言、教会和敬拜的内在。“把两块版从手中扔出去，在山下摔碎了”表圣言的外在意义由于这个民族而被改变并变得不同。“又拿来他们所造的牛犊”表这个民族在偶像崇拜中所获得的快乐。“用火焚烧”表完全源于自我之爱和尘世之爱，这两种爱注定要下地狱。“磨得粉碎”表由此产生的地狱的虚假。“撒在水面上”表与真理的混杂。“叫以色列人喝”表与这个民族结合并变成他们自己的。</p>

Verses 15-20. And Moses looked back, and came down from the mountain, and the two tables of the Testimony were in his hand; the tables were written on the two crossings, hereupon and hereupon were they 
written. And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. And Joshua heard the voice of the people in their shouting, and he said unto Moses, There 
is a voice of war in the camp. And he said, It is not the voice of a cry for victory, neither is it the voice of a cry for being overcome: the voice of a miserable cry do I hear. And it came to pass, 
as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dances; and Moses waxed hot with anger, and he cast the tables out of his hand, and broke them beneath the mountain. And he took the calf 
which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it even to powder, and strewed it upon the faces of the waters, and made the sons of Israel drink. "And Moses looked back and came down from the 
mountain," signifies the Word let down from heaven; "and the two tables of the Testimony were in his hand," signifies the Word of the Lord in special and in general; "the tables were written on the 
two crossings, hereupon and hereupon were they written," signifies by which there is the conjunction of the Lord with the human race, or of heaven with the world; "and the tables were the work of God, 
and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables," signifies that the external and the internal sense of the Word were from the Divine, and are Divine truth; "and Joshua heard the voice 
of the people in their shouting," signifies survey and taking notice in respect to the quality of the interiors of that nation; "and he said unto Moses, There is a voice of war in the camp," signifies 
an assault upon the truth and good which are of heaven and of the church, by falsities and evils which are from hell; "and he said, It is not the voice of a cry for victory, neither is it the voice 
of a cry for being overcome," signifies heaven acting on one side and hell on the other, thus falsity against truth and truth against falsity; "the voice of a miserable cry do I hear," signifies the lamentable 
state of their interiors; "and it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp," signifies hell, in which that nation then was; "that he saw the calf and the dances," signifies infernal 
worship, which was according to the delight of the external loves of that nation, and its consequent interior festivity; "and Moses waxed hot with anger," signifies the turning away of that nation 
from the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship; "and he cast the tables out of his hand, and broke them beneath the mountain," signifies the external sense of the Word changed and different 
on account of that nation; "and he took the calf which they had made," signifies the delight of the idolatrous worship of that nation; "and burnt it with fire," signifies derived altogether from the 
loves of self and the world, which are condemned to hell; "and ground it even to powder," signifies the infernal falsity therefrom; "and strewed it upon the faces of the waters," signifies commixture 
with truths; "and made the sons of Israel drink," signifies conjoined and appropriated to that nation. </p>

Verses 15-20  And Moses looked back and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand; the tablets were written on across them both, from the edge of one and from 
the edge of the other they were written on<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>, 
and he said to Moses, There is the noise of war in the camp. And he said, It is not the noise of the cry in victory, and it is not the noise of the cry in defeat; the noise of a wretched cry 
I hear. And it happened, as he came near the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dances; and Moses grew hot with anger, and threw the tablets out of his hand and broke them beneath the mountain. And he 
took the calf which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it up till it was powder, and sprinkled it on the face of the water, and made the children of Israel drink it. </p>
<p>'And Moses 
looked back and went down from the mountain' means the Word sent down from heaven. 'And the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand' means the Lord's Word specifically and generally. 'The tablets 
were written on across them both, from the edge of one and from the edge of the other they were written on' means through which the Lord was joined to the human race, or heaven to the world. 'And the 
tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets' means the outward sense of the Word and the inward - which come from the Divine - and Divine Truth. 'And 
Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted' means contemplating and discerning what the interiors of that nation were like. 'And he said to Moses, There is the noise of war in the camp' means 
an assault on the truth and good which are heaven and the Church's by falsities and evils which come from hell. 'And he said, It is not the noise of the cry in victory, and it is not the noise of 
the cry in defeat' means heaven acting from one side and hell from the other, thus falsity acting against truth, and truth against falsity. 'The noise of a wretched cry I hear' means the lamentable state 
of their interiors. 'And it happened, as he came near the camp' means near to hell, in which that nation was then. 'That he saw the calf, and the dances' means the hellish worship, which was in keeping 
with the delight belonging to that nation's external kinds of love, and the desire of their interiors to celebrate. 'And Moses grew hot with anger' means that nation's turning away from the internal 
side of the Word, the Church, and worship. 'And threw the tablets out of his hand and broke them beneath the mountain' means that the outward sense of the Word was altered and made different on account 
of that nation. 'And he took the calf which they had made' means the delight which that nation took in idolatrous worship. 'And burned it in the fire' means arising completely from self-love and 
love of the world, which are condemned to hell. 'And ground it up till it was powder' means the hellish falsity resulting from it. ['And sprinkled it on the face of the water' means a mixing together 
with truths.] 'And made the children of Israel drink it' means joined to that nation and made their own.

Vers. 15-20. Et respexit, et descendit Moscheh de monte, et duae tabulae testimonii in manu ejus, tabulae scriptae a duobus transitibus, exhinc et exhinc illae scriptae. Et tabulae opus Dei illae, et 
scriptura scriptura Dei illa, excisa super tabulis. Et audivit Joschua vocem populi in vociferatione ejus, et dixit ad Moschen, Vox belli in castris. Et dixit, Non vox clamoris victoria, et non vox 
clamoris res perdita, vocem clamoris miserabilis ego audio. Et factum, quemadmodum appropinquavit ad castra, et vidit vitulum et choreas, et exardescebat ira Moscheh, et projecit e manu sua tabulas, et 
fregit illos sub monte. Et sumpsit vitulum quem fecerunt, et combussit igne, et commoluit usque ad pollinem, et sparsit super facies aquarum, et bibere fecit filios Israelis.  `Et respexit et descendit 
Moscheh de monte' significat Verbum demissum e caelo: `et duae tabulae testimonii in manu ejus' significat Verbum Domini in specie et in genere: `tabulae scriptae a duobus transitibus, exhinc et exhinc 
illae scriptae' significat per quod conjunctio Domini cum humano genere, seu caeli cum mundo: `et tabulae opus Dei illae, et scriptura scriptura Dei illa, excisa super tabulis' significat sensum 
Verbi externum ac internum ex Divino, ac Divinum Verum: `et audivit Joschua vocem populi in vociferatione ejus' significat lustrationem et apperceptionem qualia interiora illius gentis erant: `et dixit 
ad Moschen, Vox belli in castris' significat (x)oppugnationem veri et boni, quae caeli et Ecclesiae, a falsis et malis quae ab inferno: `et dixit, Non vox clamoris victoria, et non vox clamoris res 
perdita' significat ab una parte caelum agere, ab altera infernum, ita falsum contra verum, ac verum contra falsum: `vocem clamoris miserabilis ego audio' significat statum interiorum eorum lamentabilem: 
`et factum quemadmodum appropinquavit ad castra' significat [ad] infernum, in quo tunc illa gens: `et vidit vitulum et choreas' significat cultum infernalem, qui secundum jucundum amorum externorum 
illius gentis, et inde festivitatem ejus interiorem: `et exardescebat ira Moschi' significat aversionem illius gentis ab interno Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus: `et projecit e manu sua tabulas, et fregit 
illas sub monte' significat sensum Verbi externum immutatum et alium propter illam gentem: `et sumpsit vitulum quem fecerunt' significat jucundum cultus idololatrici illius gentis: `et combussit igne' 
{1}significat prorsus ex amoribus sui et mundi, qui damnati inferno: `et commoluit usque ad pollinem' significat falsum infernale inde: [`et sparsit super facies aquarum' significat commixtionem 
cum veris:] `et bibere fecit filios Israelis' significat conjunctum et appropriatum illi genti. @1 See p. ix preliminary note 2.   significat prorsus ex amore sui et mundi: et commoluit usque ad pollinem, 
falsum inde: et sparsit super facies aquarum, significat commixtum veris quae sic prophanata: et bibere fecit filios Israelis, significat conjuncta et appropriata illi genti.$ </p>
