<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2304节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2304.</strong>很多人以为来世的孩子保持不变，如同天使当中的小孩子。不知何为天使的人可能因教堂及别处的常见形像而形成定见，在那里，天使就表现为小孩子。然事实迥非如此。构成天使的乃是聪明和智慧，而孩子若不具备这些品质，虽与天使同在，本身却还不是天使。唯等获得聪明智慧，他们才首次成为天使。而且神奇的是，彼时他们不再像小孩，而像大人，因为他们不再具有婴儿般的品性，而是具有更成熟的天使般的品性。这与聪明智慧是同步进行的，因为谁都能清楚看出，正是理解力和判断力，以及由此而来的生命使得每个人在他自己和其他人看来如同一个成人。<br />我不仅被天使告知事实的确如此，而且还曾与那些在孩提时就死去，而后来显为成人的某些人对话。这些人也与其成人后死去的兄弟说话，并且是出于彼此相爱的诚挚的兄弟之情，以致他的兄弟禁不住流泪说，他只感觉这是爱本身在说话。此外还有其它例子，在此不再引用。</p>

Many may suppose that in the other life the little children remain such, and are as little children among the angels. They who do not know what an angel is, may have been confirmed in this opinion by 
the images that are common in churches and elsewhere, where angels are represented as little children. Very different however is the actual truth. It is intelligence and wisdom that make an angel, and 
so long as the little children have not these they are indeed with the angels, but are not angels. But when they have become intelligent and wise, then for the first time do they become angels; and 
it is a wonderful fact that they then do not appear as little children, but as adults; for they are then no longer of an infantile genius, but of a more adult angelic one. Intelligence and wisdom are 
attended with this result, for it is understanding and judgment, and a life according thereto, that cause everyone to appear to himself and to others as an adult; as everyone can see. [2] I have not 
only been informed by the angels that such is the case, but I have also spoken with a certain one who had died when an infant, and yet then appeared as an adult. The same also spoke with his brother who 
had died in adult age, and this from so much mutual brotherly love that his brother could not refrain from tears, saying that he perceived no otherwise than that it was love itself that was speaking. 
Besides other examples not necessary to mention. </p>

Many may suppose that young children stay as young children in the next life, and are as young children among the angels. Those who do not know what an angel is may have become confirmed in that notion 
by the images seen here and there in places of worship, and in other places where young children are portrayed to represent angels. But in fact it is not at all as they suppose. What makes an angel 
is intelligence and wisdom, and as long as young children do not possess these, though they do indeed reside with angels, they themselves are not angels. But as soon as they have become intelligent and 
wise, they now become angels for the first time. Indeed what has amazed me, they no longer appear as young children but as adults, for their disposition is no longer that of a young child but of a 
more adult angelic disposition. Such is the effect produced by intelligence and wisdom, for it may be clear to anyone that it is understanding and judgement, and the life from these, which cause a person 
to seem to himself and to others to be an adult. I have not only been told by angels that this is so but also have spoken to a certain person who had died as a small child and yet after that appeared 
as an adult. The same also spoke to his brother who had died when an adult; and he did so out of so much mutual brotherly love that his brother who could not help weeping declared that he perceived 
nothing else than that this was love itself which was speaking. There are other examples besides this which there is no need to mention. </p>

Multi autumare possunt quod infantes maneant infantes in altera vita et quod sint sicut infantes inter angelos; qui in ignorantia sunt quid angelus, in opinione illa potuerint confirmari a simulacris 
hic et ibi in templis, ac alibi, ubi infantes ut angeli {1} exhibentur; sed res se prorsus aliter habet; intelligentia et sapientia facit angelum, quam quamdiu infantes nondum habent, sunt quidem apud 
angelos sed non sunt angeli; cum vero intelligentes et sapientes facti sunt, tunc primum fiunt angeli; immo quod miratus, tunc non {2} apparent sicut infantes sed sicut adulti, nam tunc non amplius 
infantili genio sunt, sed angelico adultiore; intelligentia et sapientia hoc secum habet, nam quod intellectus et judicium et inde vita faciant ut quisque appareat sibi et aliis sicut adultus, cuivis 
constare potest.  Quod ita sit, non solum ab angelis informatus sum, sed etiam cum quodam locutus qui infans mortuus (o)est, et dein usque ut adultus apparuit; idem quoque locutus est' cum fratre suo 
qui in adulta aetate decessit, et hoc {3} ex tanto amore fraterno mutuo ut frater nequaquam potuisset resistere quin lacrimaret, dicens quod non aliud perceperit quam quod ipse amor esset qui loqueretur; 
praeter alia exempla quae memorare non opus. 	@1 HH 340 alters to angeli ut infantes.$ 	@2 i amplius.$ 	@3 i cum.$ </p>
