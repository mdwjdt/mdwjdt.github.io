<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7073节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7073.</strong>我还和他们谈论绵羊和羔羊，他们却不愿听这类事，因为他们觉得这些事物都是地上的。他们之所以不愿听，是因为他们不明白“羔羊”所表示的纯真是什么。我从以下经历发觉这一点：当我说，在天堂，羔羊并非显为羔羊时，不过，当提及它们时，所感知到的是纯真，而不是羔羊；他们说，他们不知道何为纯真，只知道纯真是一个词。这是因为他们只对知识有情感，对功用，也就是知识的目的却没有情感（参看<a href="6815.htm">6815</a>节）；因此，由于对知识的目的没有情感，所以他们无法出于内在觉知知道何为纯真。</p>

I also spoke with them about sheep and lambs; but they would not hear about such things, because these were perceived by them as earthly. The reason of this was that they did not understand what innocence 
is, which lambs signify, which I observed from the fact that when I said that lambs do not appear represented in heaven as lambs, but that when they are mentioned, innocence is perceived in place 
of them, they then said that they do not know what innocence is, but that they know it by name only. The reason is that they are affected solely by knowledges, and not by uses, which are the ends of 
knowledges (see n. 6815); thus not being affected by the ends of knowledges, they cannot know from internal perception what innocence is.  </p>

In addition I spoke to them about sheep and lambs, but they were unwilling to listen to such things because they saw them as earthly objects. The reason why they did so was that they lacked any understanding 
of what innocence was, which is meant by 'lambs'. I realized that they lacked it from the following experience: When I said that in heaven lambs are not seen represented as lambs but that innocence 
is perceived instead when mention is made of them, they said that they did not know what innocence was; they knew it merely as a word. The reason for this is that they have an affection only for 
knowledge, not for useful services, which are the ends that knowledge has in view, <a href="6815.htm">6815</a>. Thus not having any affection for the ends which knowledge has in view, neither can they have any inward perception 
that enables them to know what innocence is. </p>

{1}  Praeterea locutus sum cum illis de ovibus et agnis, sed talia non volebant audire quia ea illis percepta sunt ut terrestria; causa erat quia non intelligebant quid innocentia, quam `agni' significant; 
quod apperceptum est ex eo, cum dicerem quod agni nec in caelo ut agni repraesentati appareant, sed cum nominantur, ibi loco illorum percipiatur innocentia; tunc dicebant se non scire quid innocentia, 
sed (t)modo scire quoad vocem; causa est quia modo cognitionibus, non autem usibus, qui sunt cognitionum fines, afficiuntur, n. 6815; ita quia non afficiuntur cognitionum finibus, nec scire possunt 
ex perceptione interna quid innocentia. 	@1 In A this   was written after n. 7076, but numbers were altered for its insertion here.$ </p>
