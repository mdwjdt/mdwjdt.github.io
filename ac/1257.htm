<p><strong>[NCE]1257.</strong> And from them the nations scattered in the land after the flood.<br />From them the nations scattered in the land means that this was the origin of all the varieties of worship in the church, with both their good and their bad aspects, which are symbolized by the nations; the land is the church. After the flood means from the start of the ancient church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1257</b></p><p><b>1257.</b>
And from these were spread abroad the nations in the earth after the flood. "From these were spread abroad the nations in the earth," signifies that from them came all the worships of the church in respect 
to goods and evils, which are signified by "the nations;" "the earth" is the church; "after the flood," signifies from the beginning of the Ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1257</b></p><p><b>1257.</b>
And from these the nations on the earth after the Flood were spread abroad. </p>
<p>'From these the nations on the earth were spread abroad' means that in these all the forms of that Church's worship took 
rise - all forms that entailed goods and those that entailed evils, such goods or evils being meant by 'the nations', and the Church by 'the earth'. 'After the Flood' means from the start of the Ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1257</b>
</p><b>1257.</b>
Et ab illis dispersae sunt gentes in terra post diluvium. 'Ab illis dispersae sunt gentes in terra' significant quod inde omnes cultus Ecclesiae quoad bona et mala, quae significantur per 'gentes'; 
'terra' est Ecclesia:  'post diluvium' significat ab initio Antiquae Ecclesiae. </p>
