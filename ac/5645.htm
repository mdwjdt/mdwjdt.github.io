<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5645节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5645.</strong>“那人领这些人进约瑟的屋里”表第一次引入来自属灵层的属天层的良善。这从“领”（bringing，或带）、“雅各的儿子们”和“屋”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“领”（bringing，或带）是指引入，如前所述（<a href="5641.htm">5641</a>节）；“雅各的儿子们”是指属世层中教会的真理（参看<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5428.htm">5428</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）；“屋”（house，或译为家）是指良善（<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>节），因而是指教会（<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节），因为教会凭良善而为教会；“约瑟”是指属灵层的属天层，如前面频繁所述。由此明显可知，“那人领这些人进约瑟的屋里”表示属世层中的真理要被引入来自属灵层的属天层的良善。所表示的是第一次引入，这是因为他们现在只是与约瑟一起吃饭，还没有认出他。这表示一种总体的联结，就是第一次引入；因为此时真理从神性总体流入，但没有被认识。然而，当所流入的真理被认识时，第二次联结就会实现，这一点由约瑟向他的兄弟揭示他是谁来表示，如后面章节（创世记45章）所述。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5645</b></p><p><b>5645.</b>
And the man brought the men to Joseph's house. That this signifies the first introduction into the good which is from the celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the signification of "bringing," 
as being introduction (as above, n. 5641); from the signification of "Jacob's sons," as being the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5428, 5512); from the signification of a 
"house," as being good (n. 3652, 3720, 4982), and hence also the church (n. 3720), for the church is the church from good; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual 
(of which often above). From this it is plain that by "the man's bringing the men to Joseph's house" is signified that the truths in the natural were to be introduced into the good which is from the 
celestial of the spiritual. That the first introduction is what is signified, is because they now only ate with Joseph, and did not know him. By this is signified a general conjunction, which is the 
first introduction; for truth from the Divine then flows in generally, and is not discerned. But when the truth which flows in is observed, there is then a second conjunction, which is signified by Joseph's 
manifesting himself to his brethren, as related in a subsequent chapter (Gen. 45). </p>

'And the man brought the men to Joseph's house' means the first introduction into good coming from the celestial of the spiritual. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing to' as an introduction, 
as above in <a href="5641.htm">5641</a>; from the meaning of 'the sons of Jacob' as truths known to the Church that are present within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5428.htm">5428</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>; from the meaning of 'the house' 
as good, dealt with in <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, on account of which 'the house' is also the Church, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, for the Church is the Church by virtue of good; and from the representation of 'Joseph' as the celestial 
of the spiritual, often dealt with already. From all this it is evident that 'the man brought the men to Joseph's house' means that truths in the natural were introduced into good coming from the 
celestial of the spiritual. The reason why a first introduction is meant is that at this point they merely ate with Joseph but did not recognize who he was. By this is meant a general joining together, 
which is a first introduction; for at this point there is a general inflow of truth from the Divine, but it is not recognized. When however a discernment of that inflowing truth does exist a second 
joining together is effected, and this is meant by Joseph revealing who he was to his brothers, dealt with further on in Chapter <a href="45.htm">45</a>. </p>

`Et adduxit vir viros domum Josephi': quod significet introductionem primam in bonum quod a caelesti spiritualis, constat  ex significatione `adducere' quod sit introductio, ut supra n. (x)5641; ex 
significatione `filiorum Jacobi' quod sint vera Ecclesiae in naturali, de qua n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5428, 5512; ex significatione `domus' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 3652, 3720, 4982, inde etiam `domus' 
est Ecclesia, n. 3720, nam Ecclesia est Ecclesia (e)a bono; (m)et (c)ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste spiritualis, de qua saepe prius ;(n) ex quibus patet quod per `adduxit vir viros domum 
Josephi' significetur quod {1}introducerentur vera in naturali in bonum quod a caelesti spiritualis.  Quod introductio prima sit quae significatur, est quia nunc solum comedebant apud Josephum et 
non agnoverunt illum; per id conjunctio communis significatur, quae conjunctio est introductio prima, influit enim tunc communiter verum a Divino nec {2}cognoscitur; at cum appercipitur verum quod influit, 
tunc est conjunctio altera, quae conjunctio significatur per `quod Josephus se manifestaret fratribus', de {3}qua in cap. seq. xlv. @1 adducerentur$ @2 agnoscitur$ @3 quo$ </p>
