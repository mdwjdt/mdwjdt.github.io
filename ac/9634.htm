<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9634节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9634.</strong>“你要作居所的竖板”表支撑该天堂的良善。这从“板”和“居所”的含义清楚可知：“板”是指提供支撑的良善，如下文所述；“居所”是指中间或第二层天堂（参看<a href="9594.htm">9594</a>节）。“析”之所以表示提供支撑的良善，是因为它们是用木头做的，支撑居所和罩棚上的幔子，也支撑遮盖它们的东西。因此，“析”表示支撑，并且它们因是木头做的，故表示由良善所形成的支撑，因为凡由木头做的东西都表示某种良善，甚至包括木头所建的房屋本身（<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。良善的具体性质则由造板所用的“皂荚木”来表示。由于自然层面或自然界中的一切代表都类似人的形式，并和它们所类似它的部位具有同样的含义（<a href="9496.htm">9496</a>节），所以居所的板也是如此。这些板对应于人里面由肌肉或肉构成的部位，它们支撑周围的膜和皮肤。此外，“肉”表示良善（<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>节）。这解释了板为何由皂荚木来作，“皂荚木”表示支撑天堂的良善（<a href="9472.htm">9472</a>，<a href="9486.htm">9486</a>节）；又为何它们用金包裹，而“金”也表示良善。</p>

And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation. That this signifies the good which supports this heaven is evident from the signification of "the planks" as being the good which supports (of which 
below); and from the signification of "the Habitation" as being the middle or second heaven (see n. 9594). That "the planks" denote the good which supports, is because they were of wood, and supported 
the curtains of both the Habitation and the Tent, and also the two coverings over them. Consequently by "the planks" are signified supports, and because they were of wood, they signified supports which 
are from good; for everything that is of wood signifies good, even to the very houses that are of wood (n. 3720); the quality of the good is signified by the "shittim wood" of which the planks were 
made. As all the representatives in nature bear relation to the human form, and have a signification in accordance with this relation (n. 9496), so also do the planks of the Habitation. These planks 
correspond to the muscular or fleshy part in man, which supports the encompassing membranes and skins; by "flesh" also is signified good (n. 7850, 9127). From this it is that the planks were of shittim 
wood, by which is signified the good which supports heaven (n. 9472, 9486); also that they were overlaid with gold, by which also is signified good. </p>

'And you shall make the boards for the dwelling-place' means the good supporting that heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'the boards' as good that lends support, dealt with below; and from the 
meaning of 'the dwelling-place' as the middle or second heaven, dealt with in <a href="9594.htm">9594</a>. The reason why good that lends support is meant by 'the boards' is that they were made from wood and supported the 
curtains both of the dwelling-place and of the tent, as well as the two coverings over them. Consequently supports are meant by 'the boards'; and since they were made from wood they meant ones that were 
formed from good, for everything made from wood means some form of good, even to actual houses built from wood, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>. The particular nature of the good is meant by 'shittim wood' from which they were 
built. Since all representatives on the natural level resemble the human form and carry the same meaning as the parts of it they resemble, <a href="9496.htm">9496</a>, so it is with the boards of the dwelling-place. They 
correspond to the parts consisting of muscle or flesh in the human being which lend support to encompassing membranes and skin. 'Flesh' furthermore means good, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>. This explains why the boards 
were made from shittim wood, by which the good that supports heaven is meant, <a href="9472.htm">9472</a>, <a href="9486.htm">9486</a>, and also why they were overlaid with gold, by which also good is meant.  </p>

`Et facies asseres habitaculo': quod significet bonum sustentans caelum illud, constat ex significatione `asserum' quod sint bonum sustentans, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `habitaculi' quod 
sit caelum medium seu secundum, de qua n. 9594. Quod `asseres' sint bonum sustentans, est quia erant ex ligno {1}, et sustentabant aulaea tam habitaculi quam tentorii, et quoque bina tegumenta super 
illis inde per `asseres' significantur sustentacula, et quia erant ex ligno, significabant quae ex bono; omne enim quod ex lignis, significat bonum, usque ad ipsas domos quae ex lignis, n. (x)3720; quale 
boni significatur per lignum schittim, ex quo erant {2}.  Quoniam omnia repraesentativa quae in natura, se referunt ad formam humanam, et secundum relationem ad illam significant, n. 9496, ita quoque 
asseres habitaculi; hi correspondent parti musculari seu carneae in homine, quae ambientes membranas et cutes sustentat, per carnem etiam significatur bonum n. 7850, 9127; inde est quod asseres {3} 
essent ex ligno schittim, per quod bonum (o)sustentans caelum significatur, n. 9472, 9486, tum quod essent obducti auro, per quod etiam bonum significatur {4}. @1 lignei$ @2 i asseres, de quo sequitur$ @3
