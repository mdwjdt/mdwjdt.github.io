<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2995节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2995.</strong>由于上古教会成员（关于他们，参看<a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>节）在自然界的每个事物中都看到某种属天和属灵之物，以至于属世之物不过是有助于他们思想属灵和属天之物的物体而已。因此，他们能与天使交谈，并且与天使同在主天国的同时，也在主在地上的国度，就是教会中。故对他们而言，属世之物与属灵之物结合在一起，并完全对应。然而，这些时代过后，即当恶与假开始居于主导地位时，也就是说，黄金时代之后，铁器时代开始之时，情况就不同了。由于那时对应已不复存在，故天堂关闭了。它消失得如此彻底，以致世人几乎不想知道是否有任何属灵之物的存在，最后甚至不知道天堂与地狱，以及死后生命的存在。</p>

As the men of the Most Ancient Church (concerning whom see n. 1114-1125) in every thing of nature saw something spiritual and celestial, insomuch that natural things served them merely as objects for 
thought about spiritual and celestial things, they were for this reason able to speak with angels, and to be with them in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens at the same time that they were in His kingdom 
on earth, that is, in the church. Thus with them natural things were conjoined with spiritual things, and wholly corresponded. But it was otherwise after those times, when evil and falsity began to 
reign; that is, when after the golden age there commenced the iron age; for then as there was no longer any correspondence, heaven was closed; insomuch that men were scarcely willing to know that there 
was anything spiritual; and at last even that there is a heaven and a hell, and a life after death. </p>

Because members of the Most Ancient Church, who were spoken of in <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>, saw in every thing belonging to the natural order something spiritual and celestial, so much so that natural things served 
them simply as objects for thinking about spiritual and celestial things, they were for that reason able to talk to angels and so be present with them in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens at the same 
time as they were in His kingdom on earth, which is the Church. Thus with them natural things were joined to spiritual and wholly corresponded. It was different however after those times, when evil and 
falsity began to reign, that is, after the golden age, when the iron age began. Because at that time correspondence did not exist any longer, heaven was closed. It ceased to exist so completely that 
men scarcely wished to know whether there was anything spiritual; indeed they did not wish at length to know that there was a heaven or a hell, or a life after death. </p>

</p><b>2995.</b>
Homines Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, de quibus n. 1114-1125, quia in singulis naturae aliquid spirituale et caeleste videbant, adeo ut naturalia illis servirent modo pro objectis cogitandi de spiritualibus 
et caelestibus, idcirco potuerunt cum angelis loqui, et cum illis esse in regno Domini quod in caelis simul cum in regno Ipsius in terra, seu in Ecclesia: apud illos sic conjuncta erant naturalia 
spiritualibus, et prorsus correspondebant.  Aliter vero post illa tempora, cum malum et falsum incepit regnare, seu cum post aureum saeculum, ferreum incepit; tunc quia non amplius correspondentia, claudebatur 
caelum, usque adeo ut vix scire vellent quod spirituale esset, immo tandem nec quod caelum et infernum, et quod vita post mortem. </p>
