<p><strong>[NCE]1280.</strong> Its first phase, in which everyone had the same doctrine (verse 1). Its second, in which the church began to degenerate (verse 2). Its third, in which the falsities engendered by self-interest started to predominate (verse 3). Its fourth, in which people started to exert control through their divine worship (verse 4). As a result, conditions changed in the church (verses 5, 6) in such a way that no one possessed religious goodness (verses 7, 8, 9). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1280</b></p><p><b>1280.</b>
Concerning its first state, that all had one doctrine (verse 1); its second state, that it began to decline (verse 2); its third, that the falsities of cupidities began to reign (verse 3); its fourth, 
that men began to exercise dominion by means of Divine worship (verse 4) and therefore the state of the church was changed (verses 5 and 6); so that none had the good of faith (verses 7-9). </p>

Its first state, in which all its members had one doctrine, is dealt with in verse 1; its second state when it began to decline, in verse 2; its third, when falsities produced by evil desires began to 
reign, in verse 3; its fourth, when people began to dominate others by means of Divine worship, in verse 4. The state of the Church was consequently changed, verses 5, 6, so that nobody possessed the 
good present in faith, verses 7-9. </p>
