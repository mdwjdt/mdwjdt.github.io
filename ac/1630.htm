<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1630节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1630.</strong>令灵人愤愤不平的是，世人对灵人和天使的生活没有任何概念，或世人以为他们处于极其悲惨的昏暗状态，仿佛处在虚空中。而事实上，他们生活在最强烈的光中，以其一切感官享受着所有良善之物，并且如此真切，以致他们能最密切地感知这些事物。还有一些刚从尘世来的灵魂，由于在世时所接受的谬见而带有这样的观念：来世不存在这类事物。于是，他们被带到天使的家中，在那里与天使交谈，并亲眼看到这些事物。他们回来后声称，他们感觉这一切都是真的，这类事物的确是实在物；但在世时他们根本不相信，也不可能相信。他们还说，这些事物必是人们所不相信的奇妙事物，因为人们对它们没有任何概念。然而，由于这是感官体验，尽管是出于内在感官，故他们还被告知，他们不应仅仅因为不理解而质疑事物的真实性。因为若除了能理解的东西外什么也不信，那他们就不会相信具有内在性质的任何事物，更不相信关乎永生之事。这就是我们这个时代精神错乱的原由。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1630.</strong> Spirits are quite disgusted by the poor opinion people have of the life that spirits and angels enjoy. They are upset to know that we imagine them as existing in a dim, obscure state (which would have to be awfully grim) and inhabiting a kind of vacuum or void. The truth is that they have the greatest possible light, enjoy every benefit available to each of the senses, and feel it very deeply.<br />There were also some souls just come from the world who brought with them (from assumptions they had adopted there) the idea that such vitality was not possible in the other world. As a result, they were taken into angel homes, where they talked with the angels and saw what was there. When they returned, they kept saying, "I can see it's true!" "Those things are real!" "I would never have believed this during life in the body. I never could have." They said that these have to be some of the most amazing things that exist, but no one believes in such things because no one understands them. Just because they do not understand it 钬?and this is something they are told 钬?they should not doubt it, since it is a matter to be experienced by the senses (the inner senses, at any rate). After all, if we believed only what we could grasp, we would not believe in anything on the inner level of the physical world, let alone anything having to do with eternal life.<br />That is what produces the insanity of our era. </p>

Spirits are very indignant that men have no conception of the life of spirits and angels, and that they suppose them to be in an obscure state, which cannot but be most sad, and as it were in vacuity 
and emptiness; when yet they are in the greatest light, and in the enjoyment of all good things as to all the senses, and this with an inmost perception of them. There have also been souls who had lately 
come from the world, and who had brought with them, from the principles there accepted, the idea that there were no such things in the other life. They were therefore introduced into the homes of 
angels, and spoke with those who were there, and saw these things. When they returned, they said that they had perceived that it was so, and that the things were real; but that they had not at all believed 
this in the life of the body, and could not believe it; also that these must of necessity be among those wonderful things that are not believed because they are not comprehended. But as the experience 
is a thing of sense, but of the interior sense, this also was said to them-that still they are not to doubt because they do not apprehend; for if nothing were believed except that which is apprehended, 
nothing would be believed respecting the things of interior nature; still less concerning the things that are of eternal life. Hence comes the insanity of our age. </p>

Spirits are highly indignant that men have no conception of the life of spirits and angels, or that men imagine that they dwell in a state of obscurity, which must be very miserable, and that they are 
so to speak in an empty void, when in fact they live in the strongest light, can enjoy all good things with every one of their senses, so much so that they are able to perceive them most intimately. 
There were also certain souls recently arrived from the world who, on account of the assumptions they had adopted there, had brought with them the idea that such things did not exist in the next life. 
They were therefore taken into angers' homes, where they talked to them and saw those things. When they resumed they said they perceived that it was true and that such things were indeed a reality, 
and that they never had nor could have believed it during their lifetime. They also said that these things belonged inevitably among the wonderful things people do not believe because they do not have 
any conception of them. As however this is an experience of the senses, although of the interior senses, they are told this, that they still ought not to doubt the reality of things merely because they 
do not have any conception of them. Indeed, they are told, if they believed nothing except that of which they have some conception, they would believe nothing concerning things of an interior nature, 
still less those of eternal life. Here lies the reason for the insanity of our own times. </p>

</p><b>1630.</b>
Indignantur valde spiritus quod homines nullam opinionem habeant de spirituum et angelorum vita, et quod putent eos esse in statu obscuro, qui non posset esse quam tristissimus, et quasi in vacuo et 
inani, cum tamen in summa luce sunt, et in fruitione omnium bonorum quoad omnes sensus, et quidem ad perceptionem eorum intimam.  Fuerunt etiam animae quae recentes e mundo venerunt, secum habentes ex 
principiis ibi captis quod talia non darentur in altera vita, quare introducti ad angelorum domicilia, et ibi cum illis locuti et viderunt illa; cum redirent, dicebant quod perceperint ita esse, et 
quod illa realia sint, quodque hoc in vita corporis nusquam crediderint nec credere potuerint; et quod haec non possint non esse inter mirabilia quae non creduntur, quia non capiuntur, sed quia experientia 
sensus est, sed sensus interioris, et hoc illis dicitur quod usque non ideo dubitaturi, quia non capiunt; si enim nihil crederetur nisi quod capitur, nihil crederetur de illis quae sunt interioris 
naturae, minus quae sunt vitae aeternae: inde est insania nostri saeculi. </p>
