<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1554节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1554.</strong>“他根据他的旅程”表根据秩序。这从“旅程”或旅行的含义清楚可知，“旅程”或旅行表进一步的发展，如前所述（<a href="1457.htm">1457</a>节）；由于这些发展是按着秩序来的，所以“旅程”在此没有其它含义。主自幼年时就完全按照神序朝属天事物发展并进入属天事物。该秩序的性质在内义上是以亚伯兰来描述的。凡被主新造的人全都按照这样的秩序被引领；不过，该秩序因人而异，取决于各人的秉性和天赋。但没人知道人在重生期间被引领时所遵循的秩序，甚至天使也不太清楚，唯独主知道。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1554.</strong> He went on his journeys means according to plan, as can be seen from the symbolism of journeys or travels as further progress (discussed in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1554/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457" target=_top>1457</a>). Since the progress followed a plan, the journeys here have this meaning and no other.<br />From infancy, the Lord advanced toward heavenly goals and reached them exactly according to the divine plan. The nature of this plan is depicted by Abram on an inner level.<br />Everyone that the Lord creates anew also follows such a plan, although it differs from person to person, depending on the individual's nature and bent of mind. What plan an individual is following while being reborn, though, is not known to a single soul (not even to angels, except in a shadowy way) but only to the Lord. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1554</b></p><p><b>1554.</b>
He went according to his journeys. That this signifies according to order, is evident from the signification of "journeys," as being further progressions (concerning which, see n. 1457); and as these 
were made according to order, "journeys" here signify nothing else. From His earliest infancy the Lord advanced according to all Divine order to celestial things, and into celestial things; and in the 
internal sense, the nature of this order is described by what is said concerning Abram. According to such order also are all led who are being created anew by the Lord; but this order is various with 
men, according to the nature and genius of each one. But the order by which a man is led while being regenerated is known to no man, and not even to the angels, except obscurely, but to the Lord alone. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1554</b></p><p><b>1554.</b>
'He went in accordance with his journeys' means as accorded with order. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'journeys', or travels, as further advances, dealt with in <a href="1457.htm">1457</a>; and because those advances 
were made in accordance with order, 'journeys' here has no other meaning. From earliest childhood the Lord advanced, wholly according to Divine order, towards celestial things and into celestial things. 
The nature of this order is described in the internal sense by Abram. It is according to that same order also that all who are being created anew by the Lord are brought on their way, though with 
men that order varies according to individual nature and character. But the order by which a person is brought on his way while being regenerated no mortal being knows, not even the angels except in 
vaguest outline; only the Lord knows it. </p>

</p><b>1554.</b>
'Ivit secundum itinera sua': quod significet secundum ordinem, constare potest ex significatione 'itinerum' seu 'profectionum' quod sint progressiones ulteriores, de qua n. 1457, quae quia factae sunt 
secundum ordinem, tunc 'itinera' non aliud significant. Dominus a prima infantia secundum omnem ordinem Divinum progressus est ad caelestia et in caelestia, qui ordo qualis sit, describitur per Abramum 
in sensu interno. Secundum talem ordinem quoque feruntur omnes qui e novo creantur a Domino; qui tamen ordo apud homines est varius, secundum cujusvis naturam et genium; sed ordinem quo fertur homo 
dum regeneratur, nemo mortalium novit, ne quidem angeli nisi umbratiliter, sed solus Dominus. </p>
