<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4799节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4799.</strong>来自另一个星球的灵人（该星球在别处有所描述）曾与我同在，他们的脸不同于我们地球人的脸，是突起的，尤其嘴唇周围，而且很灵活。当我与他们谈论他们的生活方式，以及他们彼此交往的性质时，他们说，他们主要通过脸的变化，尤其嘴唇周围的变化彼此交谈；他们通过脸上眼睛周围的部分来表达情感，以便他们的同伴不仅能充分理解他们正在思想什么，还能充分理解他们正在意愿什么。他们还尝试通过进入我的嘴唇，利用嘴唇周围的各种折叠和扭曲向我证明这一点。但我无法接受这些变化，因为我的嘴唇从小就没有接受过训练，不能在那里做出这样的动作。尽管如此，我还是能通过他们向我传达的思维确定他们所说的话。然而，通过嘴唇大体表达言语的可能性，从存在于嘴唇并交织在一起的多重系列肌肉纤维向我清楚显明。这些肌肉纤维若被解开，从而没有任何缠结地自由行动，就能在那里产生许多变化；这些变化那些其肌肉纤维挤压在一起的人所不知道的。<br />这些灵人的言语之所以具有这种性质，是因为他们不能伪装，也就是说，不能想一套，脸上却表现出另一套。事实上，他们彼此生活在如此的真诚中，以致他们根本不向自己的同伴隐瞒任何事。因为这些灵人立刻就知道他们在思想和意愿什么，也知道他们是哪种人，以及他们所行的；因为那些活在真诚中的人所行的，都居于他们的良心；因此，其他人一看见他们，就能发觉他们的内在表情或心性。<br />这些灵人向我表明，他们不会强迫脸，而是让它自由活动，不像那些从年轻时就习惯伪装，也就是说，说的、做的和所想、所愿的不一样的人。<br />后者的脸紧绷着，随时准备照他们的狡诈所吩咐的发生变化。凡人想要隐藏的东西都会使他的脸紧绷起来；而当某种看似真诚的东西假装被展示出来时，它就不再紧绷，而是舒展。<br />当我阅读新约圣言关于主的内容时，现在所描述的这些灵人，以及一些基督徒出现了；我发觉这些基督徒内心怀有反对主的无礼思想，他们还想静悄悄地传达这些思想。来自另一个星球的灵人很惊讶他们竟具有这种品质，但我蒙允许告诉他们说，他们在世时口头上不是这样，心里却是这样。我补充说，有些像他们一样的人甚至还宣讲主；那时，他们能利用伪装的宗教热情将普通百姓感动到叹息不已，有时把他们感动到流泪。然而，他们根本没有将自己内心里的东西传达出来。听到这一切，来自另一个星球的灵人对于内层与外层，或思维与言语之间竟然如此巨大的差别感到震惊。他们说，他们完全不知道这种巨大差别；对他们来说，嘴上说的，或脸上表现的，若与内心的情感不一致，是不可能的；果如此，他们会被撕碎而灭亡。</p>

There were spirits with me from another earth (of which elsewhere) whose faces were different from the faces of the men of our earth, being prominent, especially about the lips, and moreover free. I 
conversed with them about their manner of living, and the state of conversation among them. They said that they converse with one another chiefly by variations of the face, especially by variations about 
the lips; and that they express their affections by the parts of the face which are about the eyes, so that their companions can fully comprehend thence both what they are thinking and what they are 
willing. They endeavored also to show me this by means of an influx into my lips, by means of various foldings and bendings round about them. But I could not receive the variations, because my lips 
had not been initiated from infancy into such things; and yet by the communication of their thought I could perceive what they said. But that speech in general can be expressed by the lips was evident 
to me from the manifold series of muscular fibers folded into one another in the lips, which if they should be unfolded, and thus should act openly and freely, would be able to present there many variations 
which are unknown to those in whom these muscular fibers lie compressed.  [2] That the speech of these people was of such a nature is because they are incapable of simulation, or of thinking 
one thing and looking another. For they live together in such sincerity that they conceal nothing at all from their companions, it being instantly known what they are thinking and willing, what is their 
quality, and also what they have been doing; for the acts performed by those who are in sincerity are in the conscience; and thus their interior expressions of countenance, that is, their minds, can 
be discriminated by others at first sight. [3] They showed me that they do not force the face, but let it forth freely, otherwise than is the case with those who from youth have been accustomed to 
simulate, that is, to speak and act differently from what they think and will. The face of the latter is contracted, so as to be ready to vary itself as cunning suggests. Whatever a man wishes to conceal 
contracts his face, which from being contracted is expanded when anything seemingly sincere is feignedly put forth. [4] While I was reading in the Word of the New Testament concerning the Lord, 
the spirits now described were present, and also some Christians, and it was perceived that the latter cherished inwardly stumbling blocks against the Lord, and also that they desired to tacitly communicate 
them. Those who were from another earth wondered at their being of such a quality, but it was given to tell them that in the world they had not been such in mouth but in heart; and that there were 
also some who, though of this quality, had preached the Lord, and were then able by the zeal of feigned piety to move the common people to sighs and sometimes to tears, not in the least communicating 
what was in their hearts. At this they were amazed in that there could be such a disagreement of interiors and exteriors, or of thought and speech, and then said that they were entirely ignorant of 
such a disagreement, and that it was impossible for them to speak with their mouth and show in their face anything not in accordance with the affections of the heart; and that were it otherwise they 
would be torn asunder and would perish. </p>

Spirits from another planet which will be described elsewhere were once present with me, whose faces were different from those of people belonging to our own planet. Their faces protruded, especially 
around the lips; and in addition to this, they were flexible. When I spoke to them about their normal lifestyle and about the nature of their associations with one another, they said that they spoke 
to one another in particular by means of the production of variations of their faces, chiefly by variations around the lips, and that they expressed their affections by means of those parts of the face 
which are around the eyes, so that their companions could thereby have a full understanding not only of what they were thinking but also of what their wishes were. They also tried to demonstrate this 
to me by entering my own lips, round about which they tried to produce various folds and twists. But I could not receive these variations because my lips had not been trained since I was a small child 
to make such movements there. Nevertheless I was able to ascertain what they said through their communication of their thought to me. Yet the possibility of speech in general being expressed by means 
of the lips becomes clear to me from the manifold series of muscle fibres which exist in the lips and have become twisted together. If these were unravelled, so that they acted without any entanglements 
and freely, they would be able to produce many variations there that are unknown to those with whom those muscle fibres lie squashed together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason the speech of the spirits there was 
as described is that they are incapable of presence, that is, of thinking one thing and expressing another with their face; for they live with one another with such openness that they do not conceal 
anything whatever from fellow spirits. Indeed these know instantly what they are thinking and what their wishes are, also what kind of people they are, as well as what deeds they have done; for the 
acts done by those who live in that openness are lodged in their conscience, and therefore others can, when they first see them, discern what their inner countenances or dispositions of mind are. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
The spirits showed me that they do not strain their faces but let them move freely, unlike those people who since their youth have become accustomed to put on a presence, that is to say, to speak and 
act in a different way from how they think and desire. The faces of the latter are kept taut, ready to produce the kind of variation which their artfulness tells them to produce. Anything a person 
wishes to conceal causes his face to be made taut; and this ceases to be taut and expands when something seemingly open and sincere can be fraudulently displayed there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 While I was reading about 
the Lord in the New Testament Word, the spirits from another planet were with me as well as certain Christians I perceived that inwardly these Christians cherished offensive ideas opposed to the Lord, 
and also that they wished in some quiet way to communicate these. Those from another planet were astonished that they were like this, but I was allowed to tell them that in the world they had not been 
such in their utterances, but had been in their hearts. There even exist, I added, people like them who nevertheless preach about the Lord When these do so it is with a pseudo-religious zeal by which 
they move the common people to emit groans and sometimes to shed tears; yet they communicate nothing at all of what is in their hearts. On hearing all this the spirits from another planet were astounded 
that such a dichotomy between interior things and exterior ones could exist, that is, between thought and speech. They said they were totally unacquainted with that kind of dichotomy, and that 
it was impossible for them to utter anything with the lips or to express anything in the face other than that which matched the affections of the heart; and that if it were other than this, they would 
be torn asunder and would perish. </p>

Erant spiritus apud me ex alio orbe, de quo alibi, quorum fac erat diversa a faciebus hominum nostri orbis; erat prominens, imprimis circum labra, et praeterea libera; cum illis locutus sum de more 
illorum vivendi, statu conversationis inter se, dicebant quod inter se imprimis locuti sint per faciei variationes, praecipue per variationes circum labra, et quod affectiones expresserint per illa 
quae faciei sunt circum oculos, ita ut socii eorum inde plene comprehendere potuerint tam quid cogitarent quam quid vellent; hoc quoque ostendere mihi conabantur per influxum in mea labra, per 
varias plicationes et sinuationes circumcirca illa; </p>
<p>sed {1} variationes non potui recipere quia labra mea ab infantia talibus non initiata fuerant; at usque appercipere potui quid locuti per communicationem 
cogitationis eorum.  Quod autem per labra {2} exprimi possit loquela in communi, constare mihi potest ex multiplicibus muscularium fibrarum seriebus inter se complicatis quae in labris sunt, 
quae ii evolverentur, et sic explicate et libere agerent, potuissent ibi sisti plures variationes, quae ignotae sunt illis apud quos fibrae illae musculares jacent compressae.  [2] Quod talis eorum 
loquela ibi esset, est inde quia simulare nequeunt, seu aliud cogitare et aliud facie ostendere; in tali enim sincero inter se vivunt ut nihil quicquam abscondant a sociis, quin ilico sciant quid 
cogitant, quid volunt, tum quales sunt, et quoque quid patraverant, actus enim perpetrati apud illos qui in sincero sunt, insunt conscientiae, inde ab aliis ad primum aspectum possunt discriminari 
quoad vultus interiores seu animos {3}.  [3] Ostenderunt mihi quod faciem non cogant, sed libere emittant; aliter ac apud illos qui a juventute assuefacti sunt simulare, nempe aliud loqui et agere 
quam cogitare et velle; horum facies contrahitur ut parata sit ad se variandum prout calliditas suadet; quicquid recondere vult homo, hoc contrahit faciem (o)ejus, quae ex contracto exporrigitur, 
cum quasi sincerum quid mentito depromitur.  [4] Cum {4} legerem in Verbo Novi Testamenti de Domino, aderant spiritus illi et quoque aderant quidam Christiani, et perceptum quod hi scandala contra 
Dominum intus in se foverent, et quoque quod tacite illa communicare vellent; illi qui ex alio orbe, mirati quod tales essent, sed dicere illis datum est quod in mundo tales non fuerint ore sed 
corde, et quod etiam dentur qui Dominum praedicant etiamsi tales, et tunc commovent vulgus ad gemitus et quandoque ad lacrimas ex fictae pietatis zelo, ne hilum communicantes illa quae cordis eorum 
sunt: ad haec obstupuerunt illi quod tale dissidium interiorum et exteriorum, seu cogitationis et loquelae, dari possit, dicentes quod ii prorsus nesciant de tali dissidio, quodque impossibile illis 
sit aliud ore loqui et facie ostendere quam secundum cordis affectiones, et quod si aliter, disrumperentur (c)et perirent.      @1 i has$      @2 illas$      @3 i et sic doceri ac reformari$
