<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1682节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1682.</strong>“于是所多玛王、蛾摩拉王、押玛王、洗扁王和比拉王，比拉就是琐珥，都出来”表总体上居于主导地位的恶与假。这从前面章节（2节）关于这些王的论述清楚可知，也就是说，它们是指恶欲和谬念。在那一节，这些王表总体上一切恶和一切假，或也可说，表恶欲和谬念，故经上说与他们交战。后来则论述了与利乏音人、苏西人、以米人以及亚玛力人、亚摩利人的交战；最后论述了与那些一开始所提及的王交战。所以，此处同样是这些王，他们仅表示属低等的占主导地位的恶与假。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1682.</strong> The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar), went out symbolizes the evil and falsity that were in general control. This can be seen from remarks above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1682/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_2" target=_top>2</a> concerning these kings, identifying them with evil cravings and false convictions [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1682/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663" target=_top>1663</a>]. At that point, these monarchs as a group symbolized all evil and all falsity or, to put it another way, evil cravings and false persuasions, which is why that verse said that war was made with them. Afterward the text deals with war against the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim, and Horites, then against the Amalekite and Amorite, and finally against these same kings, named at the start. As a result, in the current verse they symbolize simply the prevailing evil and falsity, which are less serious. </p>

There went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, this is Zoar. That these signify the evils and falsities that reign generally, 
is evident from what was said above, at verse 2, concerning these kings, namely, that they are cupidities of evil and persuasions of falsity. In that verse by the same kings are signified all 
evils and all falsities in general, or what is the same, cupidities of evil and persuasions of falsity, and therefore it is said that war was made with them. Afterwards the war with the Rephaim, Zuzim, 
Emim, and Horites, was treated of; also the war with the Amalekite and the Amorite; and finally with these kings who were named in the beginning. Here therefore by the same kings are signified only 
the reigning evils and falsities that are of a less degree. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1682</b></p><p><b>1682.</b>
'The king of Sodom went out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, that is, Zoar' means evils and falsities which reign generally. This is clear 
from what was stated above at verse 2 about the same kings being evil desires and false persuasions. In that place those same kings meant all evils and all falsities in general, or what amounts to 
the same, evil desires and false persuasions, and therefore it was said that war was made with them. The subject after that turned to war with the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim, and Horites, and also with the 
Amalekites and Amorites, and finally with these kings who were named at the beginning. Here therefore these same kings mean solely the reigning evils and falsities that belong to a lower degree. </p>

</p><b>1682.</b>
'Exivit rex Sodomae, et rex Amorae, et rex Admae, et rex Zeboiim, et rex Belae, haec Zoar': quod significent mala et falsa communiter regnantia, constat ab illis quae dicta supra ad vers. 2 de iisdem 
quod sint cupiditates mali et persuasiones falsi; ibi in genere per eosdem reges significata sunt omnia mala et omnia falsa, seu quod idem est, cupiditates mali et persuasiones falsi, quare dictum quod 
'cum illis bellum factum'; postea agitur de bello cum Rephaim, Zuzimis, Emim, et Horitis; tum cum Amalekita et Emoraeo, demum cum his regibus, qui principio nominati sunt, hic ideo per eosdem reges 
significantur solum mala et falsa regnantia, quae sunt minoris gradus. </p>
