<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5368节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5368.</strong>“他对你们说什么，就作什么”表只要有顺从。这从“某人说什么，就作什么”的含义清楚可知，“某人说什么，就作什么”是指顺从。这意思是说，只要属世层适合并顺从，良善就被联结于属世层中的真理。不过，必须说一说属世层的这种适合和顺从。只专注于世俗事物的人，尤其专注于身体事物的人，更尤其专注于地上事物的人无法理解以下说法，即：属世层需要适合和顺从。他们以为只有独一无二的一样事物在人里面行动，因而不会想到他里面有一部分是进行指示的，另一部分是顺从的。<br />然而，在他里面进行指示的，应当是内在人，而顺从的，应当是外在人。当此人不以世界，而是以天堂为目的时，因而当他视身体和世俗事物为手段，而非目的时，外在人就会顺从。当那人爱邻胜过自己，爱天堂的事物胜过尘世的事物时，他就会如此看待它们。当是这种情况时，属世层就是顺从的；属世层与外在人是一样的。</p>

What he saith to you, do. That this signifies provided there is obedience, is evident from the signification of "doing what anyone says," as being to obey. By this is signified that good is adjoined 
to truth in the natural, provided the natural applies itself and obeys. Something must be said about the natural's applying itself and obeying. They who are in worldly things only, and yet more they who 
are in bodily things, and still more they who are in earthly ones, cannot apprehend what is meant by saying that the natural ought to apply itself and obey. They suppose that there is only one thing 
that acts in man, and therefore that there is not one thing in him to command, and another to obey; and yet it is the internal man that should command, and the external that should obey, and that does 
obey when the man has not the world as the end, but heaven, and not self but the neighbor, consequently when he regards bodily and worldly things as means and not as the end; and he so regards them 
when he loves his neighbor more than himself, and the things of heaven more than those of the world. When this is the case, the natural obeys; the natural is the same as the external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5368</b></p><p><b>5368.</b>
'Do what he tells you' means provided that obedience exists. This is clear from the meaning of 'doing what someone says' as being obedient. The meaning of this is that good becomes linked to truth in 
the natural provided that the natural conforms and is obedient. But something must also be said about such a conformity and obedience on the part of the natural. People absorbed solely in worldly interests, 
more so those absorbed in bodily interests, and more so still those absorbed in earthly ones cannot grasp what is meant by the need for the natural to conform and be obedient. They imagine that 
what is going on inside a person is the same throughout; thus they do not think of one part within him that commands and another part that obeys. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Yet within him there is an internal man that 
ought to command and an external man that ought to obey. The latter is obedient when it does not have the world but heaven, not self but the neighbour, as its end in view, consequently when bodily and 
worldly matters are thought of as means and not as an end. Such are thought of as means and not an end when that person loves his neighbour more than himself, and the things of heaven more than those 
of the world. When this is so the natural is obedient, the natural being the same as the external man. </p>

`Quod dicit vobis, faciatis':  quod significet modo sit oboedientia, constat ex significatione `facere quod aliquis dicit' quod sit oboedire; per hoc significatur quod bonum vero adjungatur in naturali, 
modo naturale se applicet {1}et oboediat; de applicatione et oboedientia naturalis etiam aliquid dicetur: qui in solis mundanis, et magis qui in corporeis {2}, et adhuc magis qui in terrestribus 
sunt, non capere possunt quid sit quod naturale se applicare ac oboedire debeat; putant quod non nisi quam unum sit quod agit in homine, et sic quod non detur aliud quod in illo jubet et aliud quod oboedit, 
[2] cum tamen {3}internus homo sit qui jubere et externus qui oboedire debet, et tunc oboedit cum non pro fine habet mundum sed caelum, non semet sed proximum, consequenter cum spectat corporea 
et mundana pro mediis, non autem pro fine; et tunc spectat illa pro mediis et non pro fine, cum amat proximum prae semet, et illa quae caeli sunt prae illis quae mundi; cum ita est, tunc naturale oboedit; 
naturale est idem cum externo homine. @1 applicatio est obedientia, quae significatur per facere quod dicit$ @2 i sunt$ @3 res ita se habet, quod homo sit internus, et sit externus, homo internus 
est ejus spiritus, qui vivit post mortem, et homo externus est in quo vivit internus, et per quem internus agit functiones in mundo, externus hic homo est, qui applicare se debet interno, hoc est, 
obedire, et tunc se applicat, seu obedit$ </p>
