<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1881节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1881.</strong>当被告知世人不相信灵人能看，能听，能通过触摸感觉时，灵人们极其愤慨，甚至怒不可遏。他们说，世人理应清楚知道，没有感觉就没有生命，感觉越细腻，生命越出色；而且，他们所感觉到的物体适合他们感官的优越性，源于主的代表物是真实的存在，因为自然界和尘世的一切事物皆源于它们（<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>节）。他们以这句话表达了他们的愤慨：他们拥有比世人更好、更卓越的感觉意识。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1881.</strong> Spirits become very upset and in fact outraged when you tell them that people do not believe spirits can see, hear, or touch anything. They told me that people ought to know that life does not exist without sensation, and the sharper the senses, the more vibrant the life. The objects of their senses, the spirits said, are as superior as their ability to sense them. The representative things that the Lord gives them are real, because they are the source of everything that exists in the world of nature (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1881/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1632" target=_top>1632</a>). Their senses are much better and more impressive than ours! This is how their indignation expressed itself. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1881</b></p><p><b>1881.</b>
Spirits are exceedingly indignant, indeed are angry, when told that men do not believe that they see, that they hear, that they feel by the touch. They have said that surely men ought to know that without 
sense there is no life, and that the more exquisite the sense the more excellent the life; also that the objects of their sense are suited to the excellence of their senses, and that the representatives 
which are from the Lord are real, for all the things that are in nature and the world are derived from them (see n. 1632). The words in which they express their indignation are that they perceive 
by the senses much better and more excellently than men do. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1881</b></p><p><b>1881.</b>
Spirits are highly indignant, indeed they are irate, when told that men do not believe that spirits see, that they hear, and that they feel by touch. They have said that men ought to know this much, 
that without sensory awareness there is no life, and the more superior that awareness is, the more excellent is the life; that the objects perceived by people's senses are perfectly suited to the excellence 
of their sensory awareness; and that the representatives which derive from the Lord are real existences, for they are the source from which all things in the natural order and in the world exist, <a href="163.htm">163</a><a href="2.htm">2</a>. They are words expressing their indignation when spirits declare that they possess far better and more excellent sensory awareness than men. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1881</b>
</p><b>1881.</b>
Indignantur valde spiritus, immo irascuntur, cum iis dicitur quod homines non credant illos videre, illos audire, illos tactu sentire; dixerunt quod usque scire debeant quod absque sensu non vita, et 
quo exquisitior sensus eo praestantior vita, et quod objecta quae sentiunt, se habeant adaequate ad praestantiam eorum sensus, et quod repraesentativa quae a Domino, sint realia, nam inde omnia quae 
in natura et mundo n. 1632: quod sentiant multo melius et praestantius quam illi, haec sunt indignationis eorum verba. </p>
