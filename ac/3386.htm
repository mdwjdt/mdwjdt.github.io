<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3386节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3386.</strong>“他便说，她是我的妹子”表理性真理。这从“妹子”的含义清楚可知，“妹子”是指理性真理（<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2524.htm">2524</a>，<a href="2556.htm">2556</a>节）。所表示的是理性真理，如刚才所述，无论人们以哪种形式来理解或理性看待它，这理性真理都被视为真理。以撒说利百加是他妹子，这其中所蕴含的奥秘，和前面亚伯拉罕第一次在埃及（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.11.htm">12:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.19.htm">19</a>）、后来在基拉耳（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创20.2.htm">20:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创20.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创20.12.htm">12</a>）说撒拉是他妹子所蕴含的奥秘差不多，这一点从前面对这两点的解读可以看出来。由于类似事件发生了三次，并且在三次都被记录在圣言中，故显而易见，其中定然含有至关重要的奥秘。若不通过内义，这个奥秘绝无可能为任何人所知。不过，下文将揭示这个奥秘是什么。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3386</b></p><p><b>3386.</b>
And he said, She is my sister. That this signifies rational truth, is evident from the signification of "sister," as being rational truth (n. 1495, 2508, 2524, 2556). By rational truth is meant that 
which appears as true according to the apprehension, or before the rational, as just said. The arcanum that Isaac said that Rebekah was his sister; as Abraham had before said that Sarah was his sister, 
first in Egypt (Gen. 12:11-13, 19), and afterwards in Gerar (Gen. 20:2, 5, 12), involves what is much the same, as may be seen from the explication of the former passages; and as the same thing occurred 
three times, and is three times related in the Word, it is evident that there is in it an arcanum of the greatest moment, which can never be known to anyone except from the internal sense; but what 
the arcanum is, appears from what follows. </p>

'And he said, She is my sister' means rational truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sister' as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2524.htm">2524</a>, <a href="2556.htm">2556</a>. By rational truth is meant, as stated just 
above, that which is seen as the truth, in whatever form people grasp it mentally or see it rationally. Isaac's saying that Rebekah was his sister, as Abraham on a previous occasion in Egypt had said 
that Sarah was his sister, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2012:11-13,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 12:11-13, 19</a>, and after that in Gerar, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2020:2,%205,%2012,%20e&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 20:2, 5, 12, e</a>mbodies a similar arcanum, as may be seen from the explanation given at those two points. And because a like event 
took place on three occasions, and also these are recorded in the Word, it is clear that it holds an arcanum of supreme importance within it which cannot possibly be known to anyone except from the 
internal sense. What this arcanum is however is evident from what follows. </p>

`Et dixit, Soror mea illa': quod significet verum rationale constat (c)a significatione `sororis' quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 1495, 2508, 2524, 2556; per verum rationale intelligitur illud quod 
apparet sicut verum secundum captum seu coram rationali, ut mox supra dictum. Arcanum quod Jishakus dixerit Rebeccam esse Sororem suam, sicut Abrahamus prius in Aegypto, Gen. xii 11-13, 19, et postea 
in Gerare, Gen. xx 2, 5, 12, dixerat Saram esse sororem suam, simile involvit, ut videri potest ab explicatione ad illa loca; et quia simile tribus vicibus contigerat, et quoque illa memorantur in 
Verbo, constat quod arcanum maximi momenti sit quod inest, quod nusquam alicui notum esse potest quam ex sensu interno; quid autem sit, patet (c)ab illis quae sequuntur. </p>
