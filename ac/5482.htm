<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5482节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5482.</strong>“就从他们中间挑出西缅来”表意愿中的信。这从“西缅”的代表清楚可知，“西缅”是指意愿中的信（参看<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>-<a href="3872.htm">3872</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>-<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）。意愿中的信之所以与他们分离，是因为“便雅悯”所代表的居间层尚不存在。事实上，由“约瑟”所代表的来自神性的真理流注经由居间层进入信之良善，然后经由这良善进入信之真理；或也可说，它进入对真理的渴望，然后经由这渴望进入对真理的理解；同样可以说，它进入对邻之仁，然后经由这对邻之仁进入信。对已重生之人来说，它再无其它流入的途径；对天使来说，它同样再无其它流入的途径。<br />这好比太阳流入地上的物体。当它从种子产生并更新它们时，就以热流入，如春夏时节的情形，同时也以光流入，由此产生它们。但是，唯独光根本不能产生任何东西。这一点从冬天里的事物明显看出来。属灵之热是爱之良善，属灵之光是信之真理。此外，存在于动物界成员中的属灵之热赋予它们生命之热，而属灵之光则赋予它们生命，这生命源于那生命之热。</p>

And took Simeon from them. That this signifies faith in the will, is evident from the representation of Simeon, as being faith in the will (see n. 3869-3872, 4497, 4502-4503). The reason why faith in 
the will was separated from them is that there was not yet present the intermediate represented by Benjamin; for truth from the Divine, represented by Joseph, flows in through an intermediate into the 
good of faith, and through this into its truth; or what is the same, into the willing of truth, and through this into the understanding of truth; or what is still the same, into charity toward the neighbor, 
and through this into faith. No other way of influx is possible with the man who has been regenerated, nor is there any other way of influx with the angels. This is comparatively like the influx 
of the sun into its earthly subjects. While it is producing them from seed, and renewing them, it flows in with heat, as is the case in the time of spring and summer, and at the same time with light, 
and thereby produces them; but by light alone it produces nothing at all, as is plain from these subjects in winter time. Spiritual heat is the good of love, and spiritual light is the truth of faith; 
moreover, spiritual heat in the subjects of the animal kingdom produces the vital heat, and spiritual light produces the life thence derived. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5482</b></p><p><b>5482.</b>
'And he took Simeon from them' means faith in the will. This is clear from the representation of 'Simeon' as faith in the will, dealt with in <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>-<a href="3872.htm">3872</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>, <a href="4502.htm">4502</a>, <a href="4507.htm">4507</a>. The reason faith in the will 
was separated from them is that the intermediary, represented by 'Benjamin', was not yet present. For the inflow of truth from the Divine, represented by 'Joseph', goes through the intermediary into 
the good of faith, and then through this into the truth of faith; or what amounts to the same, it passes into the desire for truth, and then through this into the understanding of truth. Or what also 
amounts to the same, it passes into charity towards the neighbour, and then through this into faith. There is no other path along which it can flow in the case of one who has been regenerated; nor is 
there any other path along which it can do so in the case of angels. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This may be compared to the sun flowing into objects on earth. When it reproduces these from their seed and renews them, it 
flows in with heat, as it does in springtime and summertime, and also with light, and so reproduces them. Absolutely nothing at all is reproduced by light alone, as is evident from those objects in wintertime. 
Spiritual heat is the good of love, and spiritual light is the truth of faith. Also, spiritual heat present in objects in the animal kingdom gives them their vital heat, while spiritual light 
gives them life, which springs from that vital heat. </p>

`Et accepit ex illis Shimeonem': quod significet fidem voluntate, constat ex repraesentatione `Shimeonis' quod sit fides voluntate, de qua n. 3869-3872, 4497, 4502, 4503; quod fides voluntate ab illis 
separata sit, est quia nondum aderat medium quod repraesentatur per `Benjaminem'; influit enim verum a Divino quod repraesentatur per `Josephum', per medium in bonum fidei, et per hoc in verum ejus, 
seu quod idem, in velle verum, et per hoc in intelligere verum, seu quod adhuc idem, in charitatem erga proximum, et per hanc in fidem; alia via influxus apud hominem qui regeneratus est, non datur, 
nec alia via influxus apud angelos; [2]se habet hoc comparative sicut influxus solis in subjecta telluris; dum ex semine producit illa ac renovat illa, tunc influit cum calore, ut fit tempore veris et 
aestatis, et simul {1}cum luce, et sic producit; per solam lucem nihil prorsus producit, ut patet a subjectis illis tempore hiemis; calor spiritualis est bonum amoris, et lux spiritualis est verum fidei; 
etiam calor spiritualis in subjectis regni animalis producit calorem vitalem, et lux spiritualis producit vitam inde. @1 per lucem$ </p>
