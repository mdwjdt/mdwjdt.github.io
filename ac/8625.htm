<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8625节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8625.</strong>“又说，因为亚玛力的手攻击耶的宝座”表因为他们想对主的属灵国度施暴。这从“手攻击某人”和“耶的宝座”的含义清楚可知：“手攻击某人”是指施暴；“耶的宝座”是指主的属灵国度。“耶的宝座”之所以表示主的属灵国度，是因为“宝座”论及主的王权；而主的属灵国度就对应于祂的王权。有两种职分论及主，就是祭司和君王或王权。属天国度对应于祂的祭司职分，属灵国度对应于祂的王权；因为主凭神性良善而被称为“祭司”，凭神性真理而被称为“君王”。这后者，即神性真理就包含在“基督”这个名中，而神性良善则包含在“耶稣”这个名中（参看<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="3004.htm">3004</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）。“宝座”论及主的王权，因而论及祂的属灵国度，这同样适用于“耶”（至于“宝座”表示什么，可参看<a href="5313.htm">5313</a>节；“耶”表示什么，可参看<a href="8267.htm">8267</a>节）。<br />至于此处所表示的具体主题，即：“亚玛力”所代表的那些人，就是沉浸于内层邪恶所产生的虚假的地狱恶魔，想要对主的属灵国度施暴，这一点在前面已经解释了（<a href="8593.htm">8593</a>，<a href="8622.htm">8622</a>节）。那些沉浸于这种邪恶的虚假之人无法与那些属于属灵教会的人保持分离，直到主降世，并在自己里面将人身变成神性。当祂如此行时，他们就被关在地狱里，永远无法从那里上来；此外，通过流注所实现的与该教会的联系也被完全夺走了。因为属灵教会成员在信之真理上处于模糊状态；他将它视为真理，是因为教会就是这么说的，而不是因为他发觉它是真理。与这些人同在的这真理变成良善，从而构成他们的良知。如果恶毒的恶魔真的流入他们的模糊，他们就会以上千种方式摧毁这种良知；因为他们不会作用于那里的信之真理，而是作用于情感本身。他们无论在哪里发现对良善的情感的任何东西，都会立刻扭曲它，并且做得如此隐密，以至于根本察觉不出来。他们攻击这个人的根本目的。简言之，他们的恶毒无法形容；可以将它比作一种看不见的致命毒药，这毒药直接渗透到骨髓。关于这些恶魔，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在几个章节末尾通过经历予以详细说明。</p>

And he said, Because there is a hand against the throne of Jah. That this signifies because they wish to do violence to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is evident from the signification of "a hand against 
anyone," as being to do violence; and from the signification of "the throne of Jah," as being the Lord's spiritual kingdom. That "the throne of Jah" denotes the Lord's spiritual kingdom is because 
"a throne" is predicated of the Lord's royalty; and the Lord's spiritual kingdom corresponds to His royalty. There are two things which are predicated of the Lord, namely, priesthood and royalty. The 
celestial kingdom corresponds to His priesthood, and the spiritual kingdom to His royalty; for the Lord is called "Priest" from Divine good, and "King" from Divine truth. This latter, namely, Divine 
truth, is involved in the name "Christ," and Divine good in the name "Jesus" (see n. 1728, 2015, 3004, 3009, 6148). "Throne" is predicated of the Lord's royalty, consequently of His spiritual kingdom, 
and in like manner "Jah." (What "throne" signifies, see n. 5213; and what "Jah," n. 8267.) [2] As regards the subject itself, namely, that they who are represented by Amalek (who are infernal genii 
that are in the falsity from interior evil) wish to do violence to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, this has been unfolded above (n. 8593, 8622). They who were in the falsity of this evil could not be warded 
off from those who were of the spiritual church until the Lord came into the world and made the human in Himself Divine. They were then shut up in hell, whence they can never rise up; moreover, the 
communication which is effected through influx, was quite taken away. For the man of the spiritual church is in obscurity as to the truth of faith, and acknowledges it as truth because the church has 
said so, and not because he has perceived it to be truth. With these men this truth becomes good, and consequently a matter of conscience. If malignant genii were to flow into their obscurity, they 
would destroy the conscience in a thousand ways; for they do not act into the truths of faith therein, but into the affections themselves; and wheresoever they notice anything of the affection of good, 
they pervert it in a moment so secretly that it cannot possibly be noticed. They attack the very ends. In a word, their malignity cannot be described; but it may be compared to an unseen deadly poison, 
which penetrates to the very marrows. Concerning these genii, of the Lord's Divine mercy more shall be said from experience at the end of the chapters. </p>

'And he said, Because [Amalek's] hand is against the throne of Jah' means because they wish to do violence to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'hand against someone' as 
doing violence; and from the meaning of 'the throne of Jah' as the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The reason why 'the throne of Jah' means the Lord's spiritual kingdom is that 'the throne' has reference to 
the Lord's kingship, and the Lord's spiritual kingdom corresponds to His kingship. There are two offices attributed to the Lord, which are those of priest and king. The celestial kingdom corresponds 
to His priesthood, and the spiritual kingdom to His kingship; for the Lord is called priest by virtue of His Divine Goodness, and He is called king by virtue of His Divine Truth. The name Christ holds 
the latter - Divine Truth - within it, and the name Jesus holds Divine Good, see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="3004.htm">3004</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="6148.htm">6148</a>. 'The throne' has reference to the Lord's kingship, and therefore to His spiritual kingdom; 
and the same applies to 'Jah'. For what 'the throne' is, see <a href="5313.htm">5313</a>; and for what 'Jah' is, <a href="8267.htm">8267</a>. </p>
<p>As regards the specific thing meant here, that those represented by 'Amalek' - namely hellish genii 
steeped in falsity arising from interior evil - wish to do violence to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, this has been explained above in <a href="8593.htm">8593</a>, <a href="8622.htm">8622</a>. Those who were steeped in the falsity of this evil 
could not be kept away from those belonging to the spiritual Church, before the Lord came into the world and made Divine the Human within Him. When He did so they were shut up in hell, from where they 
cannot ever rise up; and also contact with that Church, effected through influx, was completely taken away. For in respect of the truth of faith a member of the spiritual Church is in obscurity; and 
he accepts it as the truth because the Church has said it is, not because he perceives it to be the truth. This truth as it resides with them becomes good and consequently composes their conscience. If 
wicked genii were to flow into that obscurity they would in a thousand ways destroy such conscience; for they go to work not on the truths of faith there but on the actual affections. Wherever they 
detect any degree of affection for good they instantly pervert it; they do this so secretively that it cannot at all be noticed. They attack the person's fundamental ends in view. In short, their wickedness 
defies description, though it may be compared to a deadly and imperceptible poison that penetrates right into the marrow of the bones. In the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said from experience 
about these genii at the ends of chapters.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

`Et dixit, Quia manus contra thronum Jah': quod significet quia violentiam inferre volunt regno spirituali Domini, constat ex significatione `manus contra aliquem' quod sit violentiam inferre, et ex 
significatione `throni Jah' quod sit regnum spirituale Domini.  Quod `thronus Jah' sit regnum spirituale Domini, est quia `thronus' praedicatur de regio Domini, et regio Domini correspondet regnum spirituale 
Ipsius; sunt duo {1}quae praedicantur de Domino, nempe sacerdotium et regium, sacerdotio Ipsius correspondet regnum caeleste, et regio regnum spirituale, nam Dominus vocatur sacerdos {2}ex Divino 
Bono, et vocatur rex {3}ex Divino Vero; hoc, nempe Divinum Verum, {4}involvit nomen Christus, et Divinum Bonum {5}nomen Jesus, videatur n. 1728, 2015, 3004, 3009, 6148; `thronus' praedicatur de regio 
Domini, proinde de regno Ipsius spirituali, similiter Jah; {6}quid `thronus,' videatur n. 5313, et quid `Jah,' n. 8267. 	2 Quod ipsam rem attinet, quod nempe illi qui per `Amalekum' repraesentantur, 
qui sunt infernales genii qui in falso ex interiore malo, violentiam inferre velint regno spirituali Domini, explicatum est supra n. 8593, 8622; qui in falso hujus mali fuerunt non potuerunt arceri 
ab illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, priusquam Dominus in mundum venit et Humanum in Se Divinum fecit; tunc inclusi sunt inferno, unde exsurgere nusquam possum; et quoque communicatio, quae fit per 
influxum, prorsus adempta est; homo enim Ecclesiae spiritualis in obscuro est quoad verum fidei, et pro vero agnoscit quia Ecclesia sic dixit, non quia verum esse percepit; hoc verum apud illos fit bonum, 
{7}et inde conscientiae; maligni {8} genii si influerent in {9}id obscurum, destruerent conscientiam mille modis, nam non agunt in vera fidei ibi, sed in ipsas affectiones; et ubicumque appercipiunt 
aliquid affectionis boni, hoc pervertunt momento, tam clandestine ut ad apperceptionem nullatenus venire possit; aggrediuntur ipsos fines; verbo, malignitas illorum non describi potest, sed comparari 
cum veneno letali inconspicuo quod ad ipsas medullas penetrat.  Plura de his geniis, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ad finem capitum, ab experientia dicentur. {10} 	@1 in$ 	@2 quod Divinum Bonum$ 	@3
