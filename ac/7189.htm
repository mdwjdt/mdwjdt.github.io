<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7189节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7189.</strong>“因大能的手把他们赶出他的地”表他们将用一切力量和能力使他们逃离他们的邻里。这从“大能的手”、“把他们赶出”和“他的地”的含义清楚可知：“大能的手”是指用一切力量和能力，如刚才所述（<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>节）；“把他们赶出”是指使他们逃离；“他的地”是指他们的邻舍。那些属于属灵教会，被虚假侵扰的人所在之地靠近侵扰他们的地狱，被称为“低地”（参看<a href="7090.htm">7090</a>节）。因此，“出他的地”表示逃离他们的邻里。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7189</b></p><p><b>7189.</b>
And by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. That this signifies that with all force and power they shall make them flee from their neighborhood, is evident from the signification, of a 
"strong hand," as being with all force and power (of which just above, n. 7188); from the signification of "driving them out," as being to put to flight; and from the signification of "their land," as 
being their neighborhood. (That the land where they of the spiritual church are infested by falsities is near the hells which infest, and is called the "lower earth," see n. 7090.) Hence "from their 
land" denotes from their neighborhood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7189</b></p><p><b>7189.</b>
'And with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land' means that with all their strength and power they will make them flee from their proximity. This is clear from the meaning of 'with a strong 
hand' as with all their strength and power, dealt with immediately above in <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>; from the meaning of 'driving them out' as making them flee; and from the meaning of 'his land' as proximity. The land 
where those who belong to the spiritual Church are molested by falsities is in close proximity to the hells that molest them and is called the lower earth, see <a href="7090.htm">7090</a>. Therefore 'out of his land' means 
from their proximity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7189</b>
</p><b>7189.</b>
`Et manu forti expellet illos e terra sua': quod significet quod omni vi et potentia a propinquitate fugabunt illos, constat ex significatione `manu forti' quod sit omni vi et potentia, de qua mox supra 
n. 7188; ex significatione `expellere illos' quod sit fugare; et ex significatione `terrae suae' quod sit {1}propinquitas; quod terra ubi illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali (x)infestantur a falsis sit 
propinqua infernis quae infestant, et vocatur terra inferior, videatur n. 7090; inde {2}`e terta sua' est e propinquitate. 	@1 ex propinquate (propinquitate intended)$ 	@2 per terram suam hic significatur 
propinquitas$ </p>
