<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4229节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第32章</h4><br />最后的审判（续）<br />4229.我们从第三卷（系指拉丁文的第3卷）开始解释主在马太福音24章关于最后审判的预言。这些解释被放在了那一卷最后几章的开头部分，目前已解释到31节（参看<a href="3353.htm">3353</a>-<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3486.htm">3486</a>-<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="3650.htm">3650</a>-<a href="3655.htm">3655</a>，<a href="3897.htm">3897</a>-<a href="3901.htm">3901</a>，<a href="4056.htm">4056</a>-<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。概括地说，主的这些预言的内义从所给出的解释很清楚看出来，即祂预言了教会的逐渐毁灭和最终一个新教会的建立，其次序如下：<br />⑴教会成员不再知道何为良善与真理，反而开始彼此争论它们。<br />⑵他们蔑视它们。<br />⑶他们从心里不承认它们。<br />⑷他们亵渎它们。<br />⑸由于信之真理和爱之良善仍存留在某些被称为“选民”的人当中，故经上描述了那时信之真理所具有的状态。<br />⑹然后描述了仁的状态。<br />⑺最后论述了一个新教会的开始，由最后所解释的那些话来表示，即：<br />祂要差遣祂的使者，用号筒的大声，将祂的选民从四风，从天这边到天那边，都招聚了来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.31.htm">24:31</a>）<br />这些话表示一个新教会的开始（参看<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>e节）。</p>

In volume 3* a commencement was made with the explication of the Lord's predictions in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew concerning the Last Judgment, the explication being prefixed to the last chapters 
of that volume, and being continued as far as the thirty-first verse of the chapter in the Evangelist just referred to (see n. 3353-3356, 3486-3489, 3650-3655, 3897-3901, 4056-4060). The internal 
sense in a summary of these predictions of the Lord plainly appears from the explications already given, namely, that prediction is there made concerning the successive vastation of the church, and 
the ultimate setting up of a New Church, in the following order: </p>
<p>1. That the members of the church would begin not to know what good and truth are, and would dispute about them. 2. That they would 
hold them in contempt. 3. That at heart they would not acknowledge them. 4. That they would profane them. 5. And because the truth of faith and the good of charity would still remain with some, who 
are called the "elect," a description is given of the state of the faith as it then existed. 6. Next of the state of the charity. 7. And finally the commencement of a New Church is treated of, which 
is meant by the words that were last explained:  He shall send forth His angels with a trumpet and a great voice, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the end of the heavens 
even to the end thereof (Matt. 24:31), by which is meant the commencement of a New Church (see n. 4060e). * That is, of the original Latin work. </p>

<p>In Volume Three<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> an explanation was begun of what the Lord has foretold in Matthew <a href="24.htm">24</a> about the Last Judgement. The explanation stands in the preliminary sections to the final chapters of that 
volume and has been taken as far as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2024:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 24:31</a>, see <a href="3353.htm">3353</a>-<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3486.htm">3486</a>-<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>, <a href="3650.htm">3650</a>-<a href="3655.htm">3655</a>, <a href="3897.htm">3897</a>-<a href="3901.htm">3901</a>, <a href="4056.htm">4056</a>-<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>. The internal sense in brief of all that He foretold is evident from the explanations contained 
in those paragraphs; that is to say, He foretold the progressive ruination of the Church and the establishment at length of a new Church, in the following order: </p>
<p> <a href="1.htm">1</a> People ceased to know what good 
or truth was, and instead began to argue with one another about these.  </p>
<p><a href="2.htm">2</a> They treated them with contempt.  </p>
<p><a href="3.htm">3</a> They did not in their hearts acknowledge them.  </p>
<p><a href="4.htm">4</a> They profaned them. </p>
<p><a href="5.htm">5</a> And 
because the truth of faith and the good of love would continue to exist with some who are called the elect, the state of faith as this will be at that time is described. </p>
<p><a href="6.htm">6</a> Then the state of charity 
as this will be. </p>
<p><a href="7.htm">7</a> And finally the beginning of a new Church is dealt with, which is meant by the words which were explained last of all, namely, </p>
<p>And He will send out His angels with a trumpet 
and a loud voice, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end of them. Verse 31. </p>
<p>These words are used to mean the beginning of a new Church, see 
the end of <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>.

<p>In Parte Tertia inceptum est explicare illa quae Dominus apud Matthaeum capite xxiv praedixerat de Ultimo Judicio; et explicatio 
illa praemissa est ante ultima capita ibi, et cum explicatione continuatum est usque ad versum 31 illius Evangelistae, videantur n. 3353-3356, n. 3486-3489, n. 3650-3655, n. 3897-3901, n. 4056-4060; 
quis sensus internus Omnium illorum in summario, patet ab illis quae ibi explicata sunt, quod nempe praedictum sit de successiva vastatione Ecclesiae, et tandem de instauratione novae, hoc Ordine: 
I. Quod non inciperent scire quid bonum et verum, sed litigarent de illis: II. Quod contemnerent illa: III. Quod non corde agnoscerent: IV. Quod profanarent: V. Et quia adhuc permansurum verum fidei 
et bonum charitatis apud quosdam, qui electi vocantur, describitur status fidei tunc: VI. Et dein status charitatis: VII. Ac demum agitur de initia novae Ecclesiae, quae intelligitur per verba 
quae ultimo explicata sunt, nempe per haec,           Et emittet angelos Suos cum tuba et voce magna, et      congregabunt electos Ipsius a quatuor ventis, ab extremo      caelorum usque ad extremum 
illorum, vers. 31, per quae quod initium novae Ecclesiae intellectum sit, videatur n. 40 ad finem. </p>
