<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3035节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3035.</strong>“耶和华天上的神”表主的神性本身。这从前面所述（<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>节）清楚可知，也就是说，“耶和华天上的神”是指主的神性本身。“耶和华”这个名经常出现在旧约中，唯独表示主。因为旧约里的每一个细节在内义上都指向主，教会的每一个宗教仪式都代表祂（参看<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>节）。此外，属于属天教会的上古之人将耶和华仅仅视为主，而非其他任何人（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>节）。此处和别处的“耶和华”似乎表示某个级别更高的其他人。但字义具有这样的性质：它会将内义联为一体的事物分开。这是因为不得不通过字义接受教导的人必须先有数个的概念，否则，他不可能有一的概念。因为对人来说，一个整体是由数个部分形成的，或也可说，同时存在的事物是连续产生的。主里面有很多属性，全部都是耶和华。因此，是字义视这些属性为分开的实体，而天堂绝不这样。天堂以一种简单的概念承认一神，不会将祂分开，并且它也不承认除主以外的任何人。</p>

Jehovah the God of heaven. That this signifies the Lord's Divine Itself, is evident from what was said above (n. 3023), namely, that "Jehovah the God of heaven," is the Lord's Divine Itself; for by "Jehovah," 
so often named in the Word of the Old Testament, is meant the Lord alone; for all things therein in general and particular treat of Him in the internal sense; and all and each of the rites of 
the church represented Him (see n. 1736, 2921); and that the men of the most ancient times, who were of the celestial church, understood by Jehovah no other than the Lord (n. 1343). In the sense of 
the letter here and elsewhere the appearance is that another, who is higher, is meant by "Jehovah;" but the sense of the letter is such as to separate what the internal sense unites; and this for the 
reason that the man who is to be instructed from the sense of the letter cannot have an idea of a one, unless he first has an idea of more than one; for a one with man is formed from many; or what is 
the same, from successive things is formed that which is simultaneous. There are many things in the Lord, and all are Jehovah. This is the reason why the sense of the letter makes a distinction, while 
heaven by no means does so; but acknowledges one God in a simple idea, and no other than the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3035</b></p><p><b>3035.</b>
'Jehovah, the God of heaven' means the Lord's Divine itself. This is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="3023.htm">3023</a> - that 'Jehovah, the God of heaven' is the Lord's Divine itself, for the name 'Jehovah', 
which occurs so many times in the Old Testament Word, was used to mean the Lord alone. Every single detail there refers in the internal sense to Him, and every single religious observance of the 
Church represented Him, see <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>. Furthermore the most ancient people who belonged to the celestial Church did not mean by 'Jehovah' anyone other than the Lord, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>. Here and elsewhere in the sense 
of the letter it seems as though someone other, who is higher, is meant by Jehovah; but the sense of the letter is such that it sets forth as separate entities things which the internal sense presents 
as one. The reason for this is that man who has to be taught from the sense of the letter is unable to have the idea of one without first of all having the idea of several. For with man that which 
is a single whole is formed from several parts, or what amounts to the same, things existing simultaneously come into being consecutively. Many attributes exist in the Lord, and all are Jehovah, and 
therefore the sense of the letter regards these as separate entities, whereas heaven never does so. Heaven acknowledges one God with an idea that does not divide Him; nor does it acknowledge anyone 
other than the Lord. </p>

</p><b>3035.</b>
`Jehovah Deus caeli': quod significet ipsum Divinum Domini, constat ab illis quae supra n. 3023 dicta sunt, quod nempe Jehovah Deus caeli sit ipsum Divinum Domini; per Jehovam enim, qui toties nominatur 
in {1}Verbo Veteris Testamenti, solus Dominus intellectus est, omnia enim et singula quae ibi, de Ipso in sensu interno agunt, et omnes et singuli ritus Ecclesiae Ipsum repraesentabant, videatur 
n. 1736, 2921; et quod antiquissimi qui ab Ecclesia caelesti, non alium per Jehovam intellexerint quam Dominum, n. 1343.  In sensu litterae hic et alibi apparet sicut alius qui superior per Jehovam intelligatur, 
sed sensus litterae est talis; distinguit ille quae sensus internus unit; et hoc ex causa quia homo qui a sensu litterae instruendus, non habere possit ideam unius nisi prius plurium, unum 
enim apud hominem formatur ex pluribus, seu quod idem, ex successivis illud quod simul est; plura in Domino sunt, et omnia Jehovah sunt: inde est quod sensus litterae distinguat; at caelum nusquam {2}distinguit, 
sed unum Deum simplici idea agnoscit, nec alium quam Dominum. @1 Veteri Testamento$  @2 distinguat$  </p>
