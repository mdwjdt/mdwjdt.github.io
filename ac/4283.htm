<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4283节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4283.</strong>“那人说，天黎明了，容我去吧”表当结合即将来临时，试探就会结束。这从“容我去”和“黎明”的含义清楚可知：“容我去”，也就是不要和我摔跤了，是指试探结束，因为“摔跤”表示试探（参看<a href="4274.htm">4274</a>节），从下文明显可知，摔跤结束了；“黎明”是指“雅各”所表属世良善与属天-属灵层，或真理的神性良善的结合，如前所述（<a href="4275.htm">4275</a>节）。摔跤在黎明之前开始，黎明之后结束，然后经上又讲述了太阳升起时所发生的事，这是因为一天的各个时间段，和一年的各个时间段一样，皆表状态（<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>节），在此表示通过试探结合的状态。事实上，内在人与外在人正当结合之时，就是他的“黎明”，因为这个时候，他进入一种属灵或属天的状态。也是这个时候，若他的状态是诸如能发现它的那种，那么如同黎明那样的光明就会向他显现。更重要的是，当这黎明首先放出光芒，开始这一天的时候，其心智的理解或认知部分就会接受光明，他如同早晨睡醒的人。</p>

And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. That this signifies that the temptation ceased when the conjunction was at hand, is evident from the signification of "Let me go," that is, from wrestling 
with me, as being that the temptation ceased (that the "wrestling" denotes temptation, see above, n. 4274, and that it ceased is manifest from what follows); and from the signification of the "dawn," 
as being the conjunction of the natural good signified by "Jacob" with the celestial spiritual, or the Divine good of truth (of which also above, n. 4275). That the wrestling was begun before the dawn 
arose, and ceased after it arose, and that then is related what took place when the sun was risen, is because the times of the day, like the times of the year, signify states (n. 487, 488, 493, 893, 
2788, 3785), here, states of conjunction by means of temptations. For when the conjunction of the internal man with the external is being effected, then it is the dawn to him, because he then enters 
into a spiritual or celestial state. Then also light like that of the dawn appears to him if he is in such a state as to be able to observe it. Moreover his understanding is enlightened, and he is as 
one awakened from sleep in the early morning, when the dawn is first lighting and beginning the day. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4283</b></p><p><b>4283.</b>
'He said, Let me go, for the dawn is coming up' means that the temptation came to an end when the joining together was at hand. This is clear from the meaning of 'letting me go' - that is to say, 'give 
up wrestling with me' - as the ending of the temptation (for 'wrestling' means temptation, see above in <a href="4274.htm">4274</a>; and the fact that it did come to an end is evident from what follows); and from the meaning 
of 'the dawn' as the joining of natural good, meant by 'Jacob', to the celestial-spiritual, that is, to the Divine good of truth, also dealt with above in <a href="4275.htm">4275</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why the wrestling 
began before the dawn came up and why it finished after it came up, and why what happened when the sun had risen is mentioned after that, is that the times of day, like the seasons of the year, mean 
states, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>. At present the state of conjunction effected by temptations is meant; for when the joining of the internal man to the external takes place it is 'dawn' to him, 
because at that time he enters a spiritual or a celestial state. At that time also light like that at dawn is seen by him, if his state is such that he is able to observe it What is more, the understanding 
part of his mind receives light and becomes for him like the experience of waking up in the morning from sleep, when dawn first sheds her light and starts off the day. </p>

</p><b>4283.</b>
`Dixit, Mitte me quia ascendit aurora': quod significet quod tentatio desiit cum conjunctio adesset, constat ex significatione `mittere me,' nempe a luctando mecum, quod sit quod tentatio desiit quod 
`luctatio' sit tentatio, videatur supra n. 4274, et quod illa desiit patet a sequentibus {1}; et ex significatione `aurorae' quod sit conjunctio boni naturalis per `Jacobum' significati tum caelesti 
spirituali seu Bono Divino veri, de qua etiam supra n. 4275.  Quod luctatio antequam aurora ascendit, incepta sit, et quod postquam ascendit, finita sit, et dein quod memoretur quid factum cum 
exortus est {2} sol, est quia tempora diei sicut tempora anni significant status n. 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3785, hic, status conjunctionis per tentationes; cum enim conjunctio fit interni hominis 
cum externo, tunc est ei `aurora,' nam tunc intrat statum spiritualem seu caelestem; etiam tunc ei lux sicut aurorae apparet, si in tali statu sit ut illam appercipere possit; alioquin ejus intellectuale 
illuminatur ac fit ei sicut tum expergiscitur a somno tempore matutino cum aurora primum illustrat et incohat diem.      @1 i nunc$      @2 sit$ </p>
