<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6616节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6616.</strong>一个观念含有众多细节在里面，这一事实也通过以下经历向我证明了：每当听见灵人向我说话时，单单从他们说话的语气，我就能发觉他们是出于伪装、诚实、友善，还是出于爱之良善在说。人从别人脸上的表情也能看出这一点，还能从他的话在某种程度上听出来。因为当一个人看见他脸上高兴的表情，听见客气的话语时，就能分辨出这些东西是否含有伪装、欺骗，或要么由于天性，要么由于特殊情况的高兴，是否含有谦逊、友好，或疯狂等等。这一切同样表明，每个观念都含有无数细节在里面。当我与灵人谈论这个话题时，其中一些灵人不能相信。于是他们被带到一个更高的地方，从那里与我说话，说，他们能看见属于我的每个思维观念的无数细节。因此，他们便信了我告诉他们的话。</p>

That there are so many things in one idea has also been made evident to me from the fact that when I heard spirits speaking with me, I could perceive from the mere tone of their speech whether they were 
speaking from pretense, from sincerity, from a friendly feeling, or from the good of love. A man can see this from the expression of the face of another man, and can also in some measure hear it from 
his speech; for when a man sees a glad expression shown him, and hears fair-spoken words, he can perceive whether there is in it pretense, or deceit, whether a gaiety that is natural or accidental, 
whether modesty, or friendliness, or insanity, and so on; which also is a sign that there are countless things in every idea. When I have spoken with spirits on this subject, some of them were incredulous, 
and they were therefore taken up into a higher region, and speaking with me from thence they said that they saw countless things in every idea of my thought; and so they believed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6616</b></p><p><b>6616.</b>
The fact that one idea holds so many details within itself has also been proved to me from the experience that whenever I have listened to spirits talking to me I have been able to detect solely from 
the sound of their voice whether pretence, honesty, friendliness, or goodness flowing from love lay behind their speaking. This is something a person can see in the expression on another's face and can 
also hear to some extent in his speech. For when a person sees a face expressing gladness to him and hears words expressing agreement, he can tell whether such things contain pretence, or deceit, or 
cheerfulness owing to natural disposition or else to particular circumstance, or modesty, or friendliness, or madness, and so on. All this is likewise a sign that any idea holds countless details within 
it. When I have spoken to spirits about these matters some of them were unable to believe them. They were therefore taken to a higher region, from which they spoke to me, saying that they could see 
countless details within any one idea belonging to my thought. So they believed what I had told them. </p>

</p><b>6616.</b>
Quod in una idea tot insint, etiam constare mihi potuit ex eo quod cum audirem spiritus mecum loquentes, solum ex sono vocis loquelae eorum possem percipere num locuti {1}sunt ex simulato, num ex sincero, 
num ex amico, {2}aut num ex bono amoris; hoc homo videre potest ex vultu alterius, et quoque aliquatenus audire ex loquela ejus; nam cum homo videt vultum erga se laetum, et audit loquelam faventem, 
appercipere potest num simulatum insit, num dolosum, num hilare ex naturali aut contingente, num verecundum, num amicum, num insanum, et plura; indicium quoque quod cuivis ideae innumerabilia insint. 
 Quando de his cum spiritibus loquutus sum, quidam eorum increduli erant, quare sublati sunt in regionem superiorem et inde mecum locuti, dicebant quod innumera viderent in unaquavis idea cogitationis 
meae; et sic crediderunt. @1 sint$ @2 vel$ </p>
