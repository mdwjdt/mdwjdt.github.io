Verses 17, 18. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered unto his peoples. And they dwelt from Havilah 
unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria; he fell upon the faces of all his brethren. "And these are the years of the life of Ishmael," signifies a state representative by Ishmael 
of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; "a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years," signifies the things of this state; "and he expired and died," signifies the end of the representation by Ishmael; 
"and was gathered unto his peoples," signifies that these things are concerning Ishmael; "and they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria," signifies the 
extension of intelligence; "he fell upon the faces of all his brethren," signifies contentions concerning truth, but that he was superior. </p>

Verses 17, 18 These are the years of Ishmael's life, a hundred and thirty- seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his peoples. And they resided from Havilah as far as Shur, 
which is opposite Egypt as you come towards Asshur. [His lot] fell opposite all his brothers. </p>
<p>'These are the years of Ishmael's life' means a state representative of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, 
portrayed by means of Ishmael. 'A hundred and thirty-seven years' means the things constituting that state. 'And he breathed his last and died' means the end of the representation portrayed by means 
of Ishmael. 'And he was gathered to his peoples' means that these things involving Ishmael [were completed]. 'And they resided from Havilah as far as Shur, which is opposite Egypt as you come towards 
Asshur' means the whole extent of intelligence. '[His lot] fell opposite all his brothers' means disputes concerning truth, but that he was the superior. </p>

Vers. 17, 18. Hi anni vitarum Jishmaelis, centum anni et triginta anni et septem anni; et exspiravit et mortuus est, et collectus ad populus suos. Et resederunt a Havilah usque ad Shur, quae super facies 
Aegypti, in veniendo ad Asshur; super facies omnium fratrum suorum cecidit. `Hi anni vitarum Jishmaelis' significant statum repraesentativum regni spiritualis Domini per Jishmaelem: `centum anni 
et triginta anni et septem anni' significant illa quae sunt istius status: `et exspiravit et mortuus est' significat finem repraesentationis per Jishmaelem: `et collectus ad populos suos' significat 
quod haec de Jishmaele: `et resederunt a Havilah usque ad Shur, quae super facies Aegypti, in veniendo ad Asshur' significat extensionem intelligentiae `super facies omnium fratrum suorum cecidit' significat 
contentiones de vero, sed quod superior. </p>
