<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9108.</strong>土星灵从远处映入眼帘，同时，来自我们星球的大量灵人也出现了。后者一看见他们，就好像疯了一样，开始骚扰他们，倾吐关于信，以及主的可耻言论。他们一边满了谩骂，一边还冲到土星灵中间，出于他们所陷入的疯狂而试图伤害他们。然而，土星灵完全不害怕，因为他们受到保护，心里也感到平静。但我们地球灵在他们中间时，却开始感到呼吸困难，由此陷入痛苦之中；结果，他们一个这样，一个那样把自己扔了出去，就这样消失了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9108</b></p><p><b>9108.</b>
The spirits of the earth Saturn came into view from afar, and there were then present many spirits from our earth, who on seeing those from Saturn became as if insane, and began to infest them by infusing 
things unworthy respecting faith, and also about the Lord. And while they were full of invectives, they also threw themselves into the midst of them, and from the insanity in which they were, endeavored 
to injure them. But the spirits of Saturn feared nothing, because they were safe, and were also in tranquillity; whereas those from our earth, being in the midst of them, began to breathe with 
difficulty, and consequently to be in anguish; and so they cast themselves out, one this way, and another that, and disappeared. </p>

Spirits belonging to the planet Saturn came into view from a long way off, and at the same time a large number of spirits from our planet were present. When the latter saw them they became as if insane, 
and started to molest them, pouring out shameful remarks about faith and also about the Lord. Full of such abuse, they also threw themselves among them and in their insane frame of mind tried to do 
them harm. The spirits belonging to Saturn however were completely unafraid, because they were protected and also felt calm in mind. But the spirits from our planet, while in among them, began to find 
it difficult to breathe, and consequently to be in agony, as a result of which they hurled themselves out, one this way and another that, and so disappeared. </p>

</p><b>9108.</b>
Spiritus telluris Saturni e longinquo in conspectum veniebant et tunc aderant plures spiritus e nostra tellure hi illis visis fiebant sicut insani, et incipiebant infestare illos infundendo indigna 
de fide et quoque de Domino; cumque in invectivis erant, etiam conjiciebant se in medium illorum, et ex insania, (o)in qua erant, conabantur malum inferre; sed spiritus Saturni nihil timebant quia tuti 
erant et quoque in tranquillo; at (o)illo cum in medio horum erant, incipiebant aegre respirare et inde angi, et sic ejiciebant se unus huc et alter illuc ac disparabantur. </p>
