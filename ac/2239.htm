<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2239节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2239.</strong>“所多玛和蛾摩拉嚷叫声很大，他们的罪恶极重”表源于自我之爱的虚假和邪恶达到顶点。这从“所多玛”、“蛾摩拉”、“嚷叫声”、“罪恶”的含义清楚可知：“所多玛”是指源于自我之爱的邪恶，“蛾摩拉”是指由此而来的虚假，如前所示（<a href="2220.htm">2220</a>节）；“嚷叫声”是指虚假，“罪恶”是指邪恶（稍后会解释）。由此明显可知，他们的“嚷叫声很大，他们的罪恶极重”表示虚假与邪恶达到顶峰或顶点。这一点从下面的经文看得更明显，那里说到假若在那里找到十个，这城也会幸免（18:32），这句话的意思是，假若还有一些余留，也就是良善与真理剩下。因为当人里面不再有任何良善与真理时，荒废与荒凉，因而顶点或顶峰就会到来，这在下一节有所描述。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2239</b></p><p><b>2239.</b>
Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has become great, and because their sin has become very grievous. That this signifies that the falsity and evil of the love of self have increased even to consummation, 
is evident from the signification of "Sodom," as being evil from the love of self; and of "Gomorrah," as being the derivative falsity (shown above, n. 2220); also from the signification of a "cry," 
as being falsity; and of "sin," as being evil (to be explained presently); from all which it is evident that the "cry having become great, and the sin having become very grievous," signifies that 
the falsity and evil had come to their height, or to consummation. This is better seen from what follows, where it is said that if ten were found there the city should be spared (verse 32); by which 
is signified, if there were still any remains, that is, anything of good and truth; for when there is no longer anything of good and truth within man, there is then wasteness and desolation, consequently 
consummation (concerning which in the following verse). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2239</b></p><p><b>2239.</b>
'The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has become great, and their sin has become extremely grave' means that falsity and evil stemming from self-love reached their climax. This is clear from the meaning of 
'Sodom' as evil stemming from self-love, and of 'Gomorrah' as falsity from this, shown above in <a href="2220.htm">2220</a>, and also from the meaning of 'cry' as falsity, and of 'sin' as evil, dealt with in the paragraph following 
this. From all this it is evident that their cry became great, and that their sin became grave, means that falsity and evil came to their peak or climax. This is more clearly evident from what 
follows where it is said that if ten persons were found there the city would be spared, verse 32, meaning that if some remnants were still left, that is, some good and truth. For when no good or truth 
remains inwardly with man any longer, there is vastation and desolation and therefore the climax has been reached, which is described in the verse that follows next. </p>

</p><b>2239.</b>
Quod `clamor Sodomae et Amorae quod magnus factus sit, et peccatum eorum quod grave factum valde' significet quod falsum et malum amoris sui usque ad consummationem creverit, constat a significatione 
`Sodomae' quod sit malum ex amore sui, et `Amorae' quod sit falsum inde, quod supra n. 2220 ostensum; tum a significatione `clamoris' quod sit falsum, et `peccati' quod sit malum, de quibus mox sequitur; 
ex quibus patet quod `magnus factus sit' nempe clamor, et {1} `grave factum sit {2}' nempe peccatum, significet quod falsum et malum ad summum seu ad consummationem venerit: id melius patet a sequentibus 
ubi dicitur, `si inventi fuerint ibi decem, quod parceretur urbs,' vers. 32, per quae significatur, si aliquae reliquiae usque essent; hoc est, si aliquid boni (c)et veri; cum enim non aliquid 
boni et veri amplius intus apud hominem, tunc vastitas {3} et desolatio, proinde consummatio; de qua in versu mox sequente. 	@1 i quod.$ 	@2 i valde.$ 	@3 i est.$ </p>
