<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4888.</strong>“却找不着她”表因为就他，即犹大而言，婚姻之物根本不存在。事实上，犹大与她，并不是如同与一个妻子，而是如同与一个妓女那样同寝；因此，他玛并不想要母山羊羔，因为母山羊羔表示婚姻的保证（<a href="4885.htm">4885</a>节）。即便他玛这一边也没有任何纯正的婚姻之物，因为她的结合是儿媳与公公以尽丈夫弟兄本分的借口为名的结合。他“找不着她”就表示这些事。</p>

But he found her not. This signifies because there was not anything conjugial on his part, namely, on the part of Judah; for he came to her, not as to a wife, but as to a harlot; for which reason Tamar 
did not desire a kid of the goats, by which a marriage pledge was signified (n. 4885). Nor indeed was there anything of genuine marriage on the part of Tamar; for her conjunction was that of a daughter-in-law 
with her father-in-law under the pretext of the duty of a husband's brother. These things are signified by his not finding her. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4888</b></p><p><b>4888.</b>
'And he did not find her' means because nothing of marriage existed on his - Judah's - side. For he did not go in to her as to a wife but as to a prostitute, on account of which Tamar did not want the 
kid of the she-goats, by which a conjugial pledge was meant, <a href="4885.htm">4885</a>. There was nothing of genuine marriage even on Tamar's side, for she joined herself as a daughter-in-law to her father-in-law under 
the pretext that the duty of a near kinsman was being performed. This is the meaning of the words 'he did not find her'. </p>

</p><b>4888.</b>
`Et non invenit illam': quod significet quia non erat conjugiale a parte illius, nempe Jehudae, [patet]; intrabat enim ad illam non ut ad uxorem sed ut ad meretricem, quapropter Tamar nec volebat 
haedum caprarum, per quem significabatur pignus conjugiale, n. 4885; (m)et ne quidem erat genuinum conjugiale a parte Tamaris, erat enim sicut nurus cum socero sub praetextu leviratus(n); </p>
<p>{1}haec significantur 
per quod `non invenit illam'. @1 hoc significatur$ </p>
