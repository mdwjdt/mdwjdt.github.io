<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6353节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6353.</strong>“他们的剑是强暴的器械”表教义事物用来摧毁仁爱行为，从而摧毁仁爱本身。这从“强暴的器械”和“剑”的含义清楚可知：“强暴的器械”是指用来摧毁仁爱的事物，“器械”是指服务类的事物，这是显而易见的，“强暴”是指对仁爱的摧毁，稍后会看到这一点；“剑”是指教义事物，或宗教教义。因为“剑”是指用来与虚假并邪恶争战的信之真理（参看<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>节）；因此，“剑”是指教义事物或宗教教义，在此是指用来与真理并良善争战，并毁灭它们的教义，因为这就是那些扞卫唯信，或与仁分离之信的人所行的，仁爱的对立面在他们当中盛行。<br />被那些扞卫唯信的人用来摧毁仁爱行为的宗教教义主要是这些：人得救靠的是唯信，无需仁爱行为；这些行为是没有必要的，人甚至能在他临死的最后一刻靠着唯信得救，无论他整个一生过的是什么样的生活，因此那些所行的无非是残忍或抢劫或奸淫或亵渎的人都能得救。所以救恩只是进入天堂的准许，这意味着除了那些在生命结束时领受这恩典的人外，没有人被准许进入；这也意味着有些人凭神的怜悯而被拣选，有些人则被无情地诅咒。然而，事情的真相是，主不拒绝任何人上天堂。人们所过的生活和这种生活的交流（它们在天堂被地上的接受者感知为气味）使得他们完全不可能住在那里，因为他们在天堂被他们所过的生活折磨，比他们在最深的地狱更甚。<br />“剑”表示进行争战并杀戮的虚假，这一点明显可见于启示录：<br />就另有一匹马出来，是红的，有权柄给了那骑马的，可以从地上夺去太平，使他们彼此相杀，又有一把大剑赐给他。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.4.htm">6:4</a>）<br /><br />用剑杀人的，必被剑杀。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.10.htm">13:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“强暴”是指向仁爱所施的暴力，这一点从圣言中的许多清楚看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />强暴人已归无有，亵慢人已经灭绝；一切使罪孽成形的都被剪除。他们用一句话就定了人的罪，为在城门口断是非的设下罗网，用虚无的事屈枉义人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.20.htm">29:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.21.htm">21</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“强暴人”在原文是用另一个词来表达的；不过，这个词也具有同样的含义；“强暴人”是指向仁爱施暴的人，这一事实由“用一句话就定了人的罪”和“屈枉义人”来表示。<br />同一先知书：<br />他们的行为都是罪孽；强暴的行为就在他们手中。你们的脚奔向邪恶，他们急速流无辜人的血。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.6.htm">59:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“强暴”是指向仁爱所施的暴力，这种暴力也由“流人的血”来表示（参看<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>节）。<br />你地上不再有强暴，境内不再有荒凉和毁灭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.18.htm">60:18</a>）<br />此处“强暴”表示对仁爱的摧毁，因为结果就是地上，也就是教会里的荒凉和毁灭。<br />耶利米书：<br />我宣告有强暴和毁灭！因为耶和华的话终日成了我的凌辱、讥刺。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶20.8.htm">20:8</a>）<br />此处“强暴”也表示在属灵事物上的暴力，因而表示对仁，以及信的摧毁。以西结书：<br />这地满了流血的审判，城邑满了强暴。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.23.htm">7:23</a>）<br />“流血的审判”表示对信的摧毁，“强暴”表示对仁的摧毁。<br /><br />他若生一个强暴的儿子，是流人血的，行了这些事中的任何一件；在山上吃了，并玷污同伴的妻，欺压困苦和穷乏的人，抢夺人的物，未曾将当头还给人，却向偶像举目，并行可憎的事，取利息，索取高利；这人岂能存活呢？他必不能存活，必要死亡。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结18.10.htm">18:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结18.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处描述了“一个强暴的儿子，是流人血的”，所列举的恶行都是他所摧毁的仁爱行为；因此，“一个强暴的儿子，流人血的”就是一个摧毁仁与信的人。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，求你拯救我脱离凶恶的人，保护我脱离强暴的人。他们心中图谋奸恶，终日聚集要争战；他们使舌头尖利如蛇，嘴唇下有虺蛇的毒气。耶和华啊，保守我脱离恶人的手！保护我脱离强暴的人。愿鼓舌伤的人不能立定于地上；祸患必猎取强暴的人，将他打倒。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.1.htm">140:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“强暴的人”表示那些摧毁信之真理和仁之良善的人；“他们终日聚集要争战；使舌头尖利如蛇，嘴唇下有虺蛇的毒气，祸患必猎取他，将他打倒”表示他们与这些真理并良善争战。除此之外，其它地方也提到“强暴”（如以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.19.htm">12:19</a>；约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥4.19.htm">4:19</a>；玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.16.htm">2:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.17.htm">17</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.4.htm">3:4</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.48.htm">18:48</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗55.9.htm">55:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗55.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗58.3.htm">58:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗58.6.htm">6</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申19.16.htm">19:16</a>）。</p>

Instruments of violence are their swords. That this signifies that doctrinal things serve to destroy the works of charity, thus charity itself, is evident from the signification of "instruments of violence," 
as being what serves to destroy charity (that "instruments" denote things that are of service is evident, and that "violence" denotes the destruction of charity, will be seen presently); and 
from the signification of "swords," as being doctrinal things. For "swords" [gladii] denote the truths of faith, by means of which combat is waged against falsities and evils (see n. 2799), thus "swords" 
[machaerae] are doctrinal things, here the doctrinal things by means of which combat is waged against truth and good, and by means of which these are extinguished, because this is done by those who 
are in faith alone, or in faith separate from charity, with whom the reverse prevails. [2] The doctrinal things of those who are in faith alone, whereby they destroy the works of charity, are chiefly 
those which teach that man is saved by faith alone without the works of charity, and that these are not necessary, and that man is saved by faith alone even in the last hour, no matter how he had lived 
through the whole course of his life, thus those who have practiced nothing but cruelties, those who have practiced nothing but adulteries, those who have practiced nothing but profane things; and 
hence that salvation is merely admission into heaven, none being admitted but they who have received this grace at the end of their life; and thus that some have been elected out of mercy, and some 
damned out of unmercifulness; when yet heaven is denied by the Lord to no one, but the life and the communication of life (which are there perceived as an odor is perceived by those exposed to it on earth) 
render it impossible for the wicked to dwell there, because they are tormented by the evil of their life there more than in the deepest hell. [3] That a "sword" signifies falsity combating and 
slaying, is evident in John: </p>
<p>There went forth another horse that was red, and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another, whence there was given 
unto him a great sword (Rev. 6:4). Again: </p>
<p>     If anyone shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed (Rev. 13:10, 14). [4] That "violence" is violence inflicted on charity, is clear 
from many passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The violent one shall cease, and the scorner shall be consumed, all who ripen iniquity shall be cut off, who make a man sin in a word, and ensnare 
him who reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just into emptiness (Isa. 29:20, 21); </p>
<p>in this passage the "violent one" is expressed by another word in the original, but of similar signification; 
that the "violent one" is one who inflicts violence on charity, is signified by "making a man sin in a word," and "turning aside the just." [5] In the same: </p>
<p>     Their works are works of iniquity, 
and the deed of violence is in their hands. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood (Isa. 59:6, 7); </p>
<p>where "violence" is violence inflicted on charity, which is also signified 
by "shedding blood" (see n. 374, 1005). Again: </p>
<p>     Violence shall no more be in thy land, wasting and a breach in thy borders (Isa. 60:18); </p>
<p>where "violence" denotes the destruction of charity, 
for hence comes "wasting and breach in the land," that is, in the church. [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I proclaim violence and vastation; because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a shame 
all the day (Jer. 20:8); </p>
<p>where "violence" also denotes violence in spiritual things, thus the destruction of charity and also of faith. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The land is full of judgment of bloods, and 
the city is full of violence (Ezek. 7:23); </p>
<p>where "judgment of bloods" denotes the destruction of faith; and "violence," the destruction of charity. [7] Again: </p>
<p>     If he beget a son that is violent, 
a shedder of blood, that doeth any one of these things: if he hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his companion's wife, hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath seized spoil, hath not restored 
the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to idols, hath committed abomination, hath given upon interest, and hath received usury; shall he live? He shall not live, dying he shall die (Ezek. 18:10-13); </p>
<p>here 
a "son that is violent and a shedder of blood" is described, and all the works of charity which it destroys are recounted; thus a "son that is violent and a shedder of blood" is a destroyer of 
charity and faith. [8] In David: </p>
<p>     Deliver me O Jehovah from the evil man, preserve me from the man of violences, who think evils in their heart, the whole day they gather themselves together for 
war; they sharpen their tongue like a serpent, the poison of the asp is under their lips. Keep me O Jehovah from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the man of violences. Let not the man of tongue 
subsist in the earth; let evil hunt the man of violence to overthrow him (Ps. 140:1-4, 11); </p>
<p>a "man of violences" denotes those who destroy the truths of faith and the goods of charity; their fighting 
against these truths and goods is signified by their "gathering themselves together the whole day for war, sharpening the tongue as a serpent, the poison of the asp under their lips, and evil hunting 
him to overthrow him." (And so in other passages, as Ezek. 12:19; Joel 4:19; Mal. 2:16, 17; Zeph. 3:4; Ps. 18:48; 55:9-11; 58:3-6; Deut. 19:16.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6353</b></p><p><b>6353.</b>
'Instruments of violence are their swords (machaera)' means that religious teachings serve to destroy charitable deeds, thus charity itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'instruments of violence' 
as things that serve to destroy charity (the fact that 'instruments' are things that serve is self-evident, while the fact that 'violence' means the destruction of charity will be seen shortly below); 
and from the meaning of 'swords as religious teachings. For 'swords' (gladius) are the truths of faith that are employed to fight against falsities and evils, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>; thus swords' (machaera)<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> are religious 
teachings, here teachings employed to fight against truth and goodness and to annihilate them, for they are employed by those who champion faith alone, or faith separated from charity, and with 
whom the opposite of charity resides. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The religious teachings employed by those who champion faith alone to dispense with charitable works are principally these: </p>
<p> A person is saved by faith 
alone without the works of charity. </p>
<p>Those works are unnecessary, and a person can be saved by faith alone even in his final hour when he dies, irrespective of how he has lived throughout the whole 
course of his life. </p>
<p>Thus those who have performed nothing else than cruel deeds, robberies, acts of adultery, or unholy deeds can be saved. </p>
<p>Consequently salvation is merely a letting into heaven, 
which means that none are let in except those who have received that grace at the end of their lives, and which also means that some by God's mercy have been chosen and others by the lack of it have 
been damned. </p>
<p>The truth of the matter however is that the Lord does not deny heaven to anyone. The life people have led and the communication of that life, which is perceived in heaven in the way an 
odour is on earth by its recipients, make it completely impossible for them to be there; for they are tormented in heaven by the wicked life they led more than they are in the deepest hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'A 
sword' means falsity fighting and killing. This is evident in John, </p>
<blockquote>
There went out another horse, fiery red; and it was granted to the one sitting on it to take away peace from the earth, so that 
people would kill one another, for which reason there was given him a great sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
If anyone kills with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:10,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:10, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
'Violence' is the use of force against charity. This is plain from many places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The violent one will cease to be and the scornful one will be destroyed. All ripeners 
of iniquity<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will be cut off, those who cause a person to sin by a word, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and cause him who is just to turn aside to something empty. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:20, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here a different expression is used in the original language for 'the violent one'; but it carries a similar spiritual meaning. The fact that 'the violent one' is someone who uses force against 
charity is meant when it says that 'they cause a person to sin by a word' and 'cause him who is just to turn aside'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence 
is in their hands. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'violence' stands for force used against charity, a force that is also meant by 'shedding 
blood', see <a href="774.htm">774</a>, <a href="1005.htm">1005</a>. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
No longer will there be violence in your land, a laying waste and ruin within your borders. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Violence' stands for the destruction 
of charity, for the outcome is a laying waste and ruin in the land, that is, in the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I proclaim violence and a laying waste, for the word of Jehovah was made to me a reproach 
and ignominy the whole day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2020:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 20:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'violence' stands for violence in spiritual things, thus for the destruction of charity, and also of faith. In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The land is full of 
the judgement of blood,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> and the city is full of violence. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%207:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 7:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The judgement of blood' stands for the destruction of faith, 'violence' for the destruction of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
If he begets a violent son, a shedder of blood, who does any one of these things; if he eats on the mountains, or defiles his companion's wife, oppresses the wretched and needy, engages in 
plunderings, does not restore the pledge, or lifts his eyes to idols, commits abomination, lends at interest and takes usury, will he live? He will not live; he will surely die. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2018:10-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 18:10-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
this description of what 'a violent son and a shedder of blood' is, the wrong-doings that are listed are all the charitable works he destroys; thus 'a violent son and a shedder of blood' is one who 
destroys charity and faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil person; from the man of violent actions preserve me. Those who think evil things in their heart gather together all 
the day for war, they make their tongue sharp, like a serpent; the poison of an asp is under their lips. Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; from the man of violent actions preserve me. 
Do not let a slanderer<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> be established in the land; as for the violent man, evil hunts him down, to overthrow him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20140:1-4,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 140:1-4, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The man of violent actions' stands for those who destroy the 
truths of faith and forms of the good of charity. Their fight against these is meant by 'they gather together all the day for war, they make their tongue sharp, like a serpent', 'the poison of an asp 
is under their lips', and 'evil hunts him down, to overthrow him'. 'Violence' is referred to in other places besides these, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2012:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 12:19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%202:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 2:16, 17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3:4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:48;%2055:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:48; 55:9-11</a>;

`Instrumenta violentiae machaerae eorum':  quod significet quod doctrinalia serviant ad destruendum opera charitatis, ita ipsam charitatem, constat a significatione `instrumentorum violentiae' quod 
sint quae inserviunt ad {1}destruendum charitatem; quod `instrumenta' sint quae inserviunt, patet, et quod `violentia' sit destructio charitatis, mox videbitur; et ex significatione `machaerarum' quod 
sint doctrinalia; `gladii' enim sunt vera fidei per quae contra falsa et mala pugnatur, n. 2799, {2}ita `machaerae' sunt doctrinalia, hic doctrinalia per quae pugnatur contra verum et bonum, et per quae 
haec exstinguuntur, quia ab illis qui in sola fide, seu in fide separata a charitate, apud quos contrarium est. [2](s)Doctrinalia eorum qui in sola fide, ex quibus destruunt opera charitatis, sunt 
praecipue quod doceant salvari hominem per fidem solam absque operibus charitatis, et quod haec non necessaria sint, quodque homo per solam fidem salvetur etiam in ultima mortis hora, utcumque per totum 
vitae {3} curriculum vixerat; ita qui non nisi quam crudelia exercuerunt, qui latrocinia, qui adulteria, qui profana; {4}ac inde quod salvatio sit modo intromissio in caelum, ita quod non intromittantur 
nisi qui illam gratiam acceperunt {5}in fine vitae suae, ac ita quod quidam ex misericordia electi sint et quidam ex immisericordia damnati; cum tamen a Domino nulli negetur caelum, sed vita et 
communicatio vitae quae sentitur ibi sicut a subjectis odor in terra, facit ut nequaquam ibi esse possint, cruciantur enim a malo vitae suae ibi plus quam in  profundissimo inferno. [3]Quod `machaera' 
significet falsum pugnans et occidens, patet apud Johannem, 	Exivit alius equus rufus, et sedenti super eo datum est  ut auferret pacem de terra, ut se invicem occiderent, unde illi data est machaera 
magna, Apoc. vi (x)4: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Si quis machaera occidit, oportet illum machaera occidi,  Apoc. xiii 10, 14. [4]{6}Quod `violentia' sit vis quae infertur charitati, liquet a pluribus locis in 
Verbo {7}; ut apud Esaiam, 	Desinet violentus, et consumetur irrisor, exscindentur omnes maturantes {8}iniquitatem, qui peccare faciunt hominem in verbo, et corripientem in porta illaqueant, et declinare 
faciunt in {9}inane justum, xxix 20, 21; </p>
<p>hic violentus alia voce in lingua originali, sed {10}quae similis significationis est; quod `violentus' sit qui vim infert {11} charitati, significatur 
per quod `peccare faciant hominem in verbo', et `declinare faciant {12}justum':  [5]apud eundem, 	Opera eorum opera iniquitatis, et factum violentiae in manibus eorum; pedes eorum ad malum currunt, 
et festinant ad effundendum  sanguinem innocentem, lix 6,7; </p>
<p>hic `violentia' pro vi allata charitati, quae vis quod etiam significetur per `effundere sanguinem', videatur n. 374, 1005: apud eundem,  	Non 
erit amplius violentia in terra tua, vastatio et confractio in terminis tuis, lx 18; </p>
<p>`violentia' pro destructione charitatis, inde enim `vastatio et confractio in terra', hoc est, in Ecclesia:  
[6]apud Jeremiam, 	Violentiam et vastationem praedico, nam factum est verbum  Jehovae mihi opprobrio et ignominiae toto die, xx 8; </p>
<p>`violentia' etiam ibi pro violentia in spiritualibus, ita pro destructione 
charitatis, ut et fidei: apud Ezechielem, 	Terra plena est judicio sanguinum, et urbs plena {13} violentia,  vii 23; </p>
<p>`judicium sanguinum' pro destructione fidei, `violentia' pro destructione 
charitatis:  [7]apud eundem,  	Si genuerit filium violentum, effusorem sanguinis, qui fecerit  unum de ullo (c)eorum; si ille . . . super montibus comederit, et uxorem socii polluerit, miserum et egenum 
oppresserit, rapinas rapuerit, pignus non restituerit, et ad idola sustulerit oculos suos, abominationem fecerit, in faenus dederit, et usuram  receperit, num vivet? non vivet, .  .  .  moriendo morietur, 
 xviii 10-13; </p>
<p>hic quid `filius violentus et effusor sanguinis' sit, describitur, sunt quae ibi recensentur, omnia opera charitatis quae destruit, ita `filius violentus et effusor sanguinis est 
destructor charitatis et fidei:  [8]apud Davidem, 	Libera me Jehovah ab homine malo, a viro violentiarum  serva me, qui cogitant mala in corde, toto die congregant se ad bellum, exacuunt linguam suam 
sicut serpens, venenum aspidis  sub labiis eorum:  custodi me, Jehovah, a manibus impii, a viro  violentiarum serva me. . . . Vir linguae ne subsistat in terra, vir violentiae malum venatur in subversiones, 
Ps. cxl 2-5, 12  (A.V. 1-4, 11); </p>
<p>`vir violentiarum' pro illis qui destruunt vera fidei et bona charitatis; quod pugnent contra illa, significatur per quod `toto die congregent se ad bellum, 
exacuant linguam sicut serpens', {14} quod `venenum aspidis sub labiis eorum', et {15} quod `venetur malum in subversiones':  et praeterea alibi, ut Ezech. xii 19, Joel iv 19 (A.V. iii 19), Mal. ii 
16, 17, Zeph. iii 4, Ps. xviii 49 (A. V. 48), lv 10-12 (A. V. 9-11), lviii 3-6 (A. V. 2-5), Deut. xix 16. @1 destruendam$ @2 sed$ @3 i suae$ @4 et sic$ @5 quod fidem in fine vitae suae confiteantur, 
praeter plura quae ex illis dependent. Quod machaera sit quae pugnat et exstinguit$ @6 i ibi machaera pro falso pugnante contra verum, et id exstinguente@ @7 i violentia enim in spirituali sensu
