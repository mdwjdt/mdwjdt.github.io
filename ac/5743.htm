<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5743节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5743.</strong>“约瑟对管家的说”表新领受的觉知和流注。这从“说”的含义清楚可知，在圣言的历史中，“说”是指觉知，或觉察，如前面频繁解释的。就听见并领受的人而言，它是觉知，所以就说话者而言，它是流注；因为这两种活动互相应答。“约瑟吩咐管家的”表示来自它自己的流注（参看<a href="5732.htm">5732</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5743</b></p><p><b>5743.</b>
And Joseph said unto him that was over his house. That this signifies perception and influx anew, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being to perceive (as 
often before explained); and because it is perception in respect to him who hears and receives, it is influx in respect to him who says; for they mutually answer to each other. (That his "commanding 
him that was over his house" denotes influx from himself, may be seen above, n. 5732.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5743</b></p><p><b>5743.</b>
'And Joseph said to the one who was over his house' means perception and influx received anew. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying', in the historical narratives of the Word, as perceiving, dealt 
with often. And since it is perception on the part of the one who hears and receives, it is influx on the part of the one who speaks; for the two activities answer to each other. 'He commanded the 
one who was over his house' means an influx from itself, see above in <a href="5732.htm">5732</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5743</b>
</p><b>5743.</b>
`Et Joseph dixit illi qui super domo sua':  quod significet perceptionem et influxum e novo, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit {1}percipere, de qua saepius, et quia est 
perceptio respective ad illum qui audit et recipit, est {2}influere respective ad illum qui {3}dicit; nam mutuo sibi respondent; quod `praecepit illi qui super domo sua' sit influxus a se, videatur supra 
n. 5732. @1 perceptio$ @2 influxus$ @3 A d dicit, i loquitur$ </p>
