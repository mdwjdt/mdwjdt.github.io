<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1740.</strong>“所多玛王说”表被战胜的恶与假。这从“所多玛”的含义清楚可知，本章前面说明，“所多玛”是指恶与假。17节经上说“所多玛王出来迎接他”，表示恶和假臣服，而本节补充说，它们是哀求者。<br />之所以战胜恶与假，或通过试探的争战战胜恶与假，从而获得善与真，是因为这就是恶与假被驱散的方式。一旦这些恶与假被驱散，善与真就会取而代之，最终越发被确认，从而得以强化。事实上，正是恶灵激活恶与假，若非他们激活，人几乎不知道它们是恶与假。不过，一旦被激活，它们是显而易见的。试探的争战持续的时间越长，这类恶与假就变得越明显，直到最后它们被视为可憎。<br />随着恶与假被驱散，善与真逐渐取而代之。人越憎恶恶与假，就越喜爱主所注入的善与真。而且，人越憎恶恶与假，恶灵就越不敢靠近，因为他们无法忍受对构成其生命的恶与假的这种厌恶和憎恨。有时，就在开始靠近的那一刻，他们便感到惊恐万分。人越喜爱善与真，天使就越喜欢与他同在，这对天使来说，就是天堂。因为他们在爱之善和信之真中，就是在自己的生命中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1740.</strong> The king of Sodom said symbolizes the evil and falsity that was conquered. This is established by the symbolism of Sodom as evil and falsity, which was demonstrated earlier in the chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1740/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663" target=_top>1663</a>]. Verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1740/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_17" target=_top>17</a>. above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1740/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1721" target=_top>1721</a>] says that the king of Sodom went out to meet Abram, meaning that evil and falsity surrendered. This verse now continues by depicting him as pleading.<br />[2] The reason we overcome evil and falsity through the battles involved in a spiritual crisis, and become imbued with goodness and truth in the process, is that these battles dissolve evil and falsity, and when they are dissolved, goodness and truth replace them. Then the goodness and truth are reinforced more and more and in this way are solidified. There are evil spirits who stir up what is evil and false, you see. If they did not, we could barely recognize those things as evil and false; but when they are stirred up they are exposed. The longer the struggle lasts, the more obvious they grow until finally we gain a horror for them.<br />[3] All the while evil and falsity are disappearing, goodness and truth are taking their place. The more horror we acquire for evil and falsity, the more the Lord instills in us a love for what is good and true. Again, the more horror we acquire for evil and falsity, the less any evil spirits dare to draw near, because they cannot tolerate an aversion and horror for the evil and falsity in which their lives consist. Sometimes they feel the grip of terror with their first step toward us. The more we love what is good and true, the more the angels — and with the angels, heaven — love to be with us, because when they immerse themselves in the good impulses of love and the true ideas of faith, they are really alive. </p>

The king of Sodom said. That this signifies the evil and falsity which were overcome, is evident from the signification of "Sodom," which is evil and falsity, as was shown above in this chapter. It is 
said above (in verse 17), that the king of Sodom went out to meet Abram, by which is signified that evil and falsity submitted themselves; it is now added that they are suppliants.  [2] That evil and 
falsity were conquered, or that evils and falsities are conquered by the combats of temptations, and that goods and truths are thereby put on, comes from the fact that evils and falsities are thus 
dissipated; and when these have been dissipated, goods and truths succeed in their place; and these are afterwards confirmed more and more, and are thus strengthened. For it is by evil spirits that evils 
and falsities are excited; and unless they are excited, the man scarcely knows that they are evils and falsities; but when excited they are manifest. And the longer the combats of temptations last, 
the more manifest do the evils and falsities become, until at last they are held in abhorrence.  [3] And as evils and falsities are dissipated, goods and truths take their place; and the greater the 
horror that is conceived for evils and falsities, the more of love for goods and truths is insinuated by the Lord. And further, the greater the horror for evils and falsities, the less do evil spirits 
dare to approach, for they cannot endure aversion and horror for the evils and falsities in which their life consists, and are sometimes seized with terror on their first approach. And the more of 
love there is for goods and truths, the more do the angels love to be with the man, and together with the angels, heaven; for they are in their own life when in the goods of love and truths of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1740</b></p><p><b>1740.</b>
That 'the king of Sodom' means the evil and falsity that had been overcome is clear from the meaning of 'Sodom' as evil and falsity, as shown above in this chapter. Verse 17 above says that 'the king 
of Sodom went out to meet Abram' which meant that evil and falsity submitted. The present verse continues the idea that they were suppliant.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why evil and falsity were overcome, or 
why evils and falsities are overcome by means of the conflicts constituting temptations, and so why goods and truths are acquired, is that this is the manner in which evils and falsities are dispelled. 
Once these have been dispelled goods and truths take their place, and in the end are confirmed more and more and so strengthened. Indeed it is evil spirits who activate evils and falsities, and unless 
they do so a person scarcely knows that they are evils and falsities. But once activated they are evident. And the longer the conflicts brought about by temptations persist, the more evident such evils 
and falsities become, till at length they are regarded with abhorrence.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And as evils and falsities are dispelled, so goods and truths take their place; and the more a person contracts an 
abhorrence of evils and falsities, the more love the Lord instills for goods and truths. Furthermore the greater that abhorrence of evils and falsities becomes, the less do evil spirits dare to approach, 
for they cannot stand this aversion to and abhorrence of the evils and falsities constituting their life. Sometimes they are seized with terror the moment they start to approach. And the more love 
there is for goods and truths, the more do angels love to be with man, and this to the angels is heaven; for their own life exists with them when the goods of love and the truths of faith exist with them. </p>

'Dixit rex Sodomae': quod significet malum et falsum quod victum, constat a significatione 'Sodomae' quod sit malum et falsum, ut supra in hoc capite est ostensum; supra versu 17 dicitur (x)'exivit 
rex Sodomae obviam Abramo,' quo significatum quod malum et falsum se submiserit, hic nunc continuatur quod supplex sit.  [2] Quod malum et falsum sit victum, seu quod mala et falsa vincantur per pugnas 
tentationum, et sic bona et vera induantur, inde est quia sic mala et falsa dissipantur, quibus dissipatis bona et vera succedunt, quae dein magis et magis confirmantur et sic corroborantur; sunt enim 
mali spiritus qui excitant mala et falsa; quae nisi excitentur, vix novit homo quod mala et falsa sint, sed tunc patent; quoque diutius pugnae tentationum perstant, eo magis patent, usque tandem ut 
mala et falsa horreantur:  [3] et prout mala et falsa dissipantur, ita succedunt bona et vera; et quo plus horroris pro malis et falsis contrahitur, eo plus amoris insinuatur a Domino pro bonis et veris; 
quoque plus horroris fit pro malis et falsis, eo minus accedere audent mali spiritus, quia aversationem et horrorem pro malis et falsis in quibus eorum vita consistit, non sufferre possunt, quandoque 
ad primam approximationem corripiuntur terrore; et quo plus amoris pro bonis et veris, eo magis angeli amant apud hominem esse, et cum angelis caelum, nam in suamet vita sunt cum in bonis amoris 
et veris fidei. </p>
