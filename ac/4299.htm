<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4299.</strong>“因为我面对面见了神，我的灵魂仍得保全”表祂承受了最严厉的试探，似乎它们来自神性。这从“见神”、“面”和“我的灵魂得保全”的含义清楚可知：“见神”是指通过内层事物，也就是说，通过良善与真理靠近祂，因而是指同在（参看<a href="4198.htm">4198</a>节）；“面”是指内层事物（<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2434.htm">2434</a>，<a href="3527.htm">3527</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="4066.htm">4066</a>节），因而是指思维和情感，思维和情感就是内层事物，因为它们属于意向和心智，并表现在脸上；“我的灵魂得保全”是指经受神性或神的同在。所有这些事都表示祂承受最严厉的试探，似乎它们来自神性；这一点若不从试探的近因和远因，就无法看出来。近因是人里面导致他陷入试探的邪恶与虚假，因而是注入它们的恶灵和魔鬼（<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>节）。然而，除了有良心的人外，没有人能受试探，也就是经历任何属灵的试探；因为属灵的试探无非是良心的折磨，因此除了那些处于属天和属灵的良善之人外，没有人能受试探，因为这些人有良心，其他所有人则没有，甚至不知道何为良心。<br />良心是从主所接受的一个新意愿和一个新理解或认知；因而是主在人里面的同在；这种同在越接近，此人就越处于对良善或真理的情感。若主的同在靠近的程度超过此人处于对良善或真理的情感的程度，那么他就会进入试探。原因在于，人里面的邪恶与虚假会被他里面的良善与真理试探，无法承受更近的同在。这一点从来世所发生的事可以看出来：恶灵一靠近天上的任一社群，必定开始感到痛苦和折磨；还有，恶灵无法忍受天使看着他们，因为他们会立刻受到折磨，并陷入昏厥。这一点也可从以下事实看出来，地狱距离天堂极为遥远，因为它无法承受天堂，也就是无法承受主在天上的同在。这就解释了为何在圣言中，论到恶灵，经上说：<br />那时，他们开始向大山说，倒在我们身上！向小山说，遮盖我们！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路23.30.htm">23:30</a>）<br />别处：<br />他们要向山和磐石说，倒在我们身上吧！把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.16.htm">6:16</a>）<br />此外，从身处地狱者的邪恶与虚假所发出的乌云和幽暗般的气场看上去就像一座大山或磐石，他们就藏在这大山或磐石之下（参看<a href="1265.htm">1265</a>，<a href="1267.htm">1267</a>，<a href="1270.htm">1270</a>节）。<br />由此可知，“因为我面对面见了神，我的灵魂仍得保全”这句话表示最严厉的试探，似乎它们来自神性。试探和折磨之所以看似来自神性，是因为如前所述，它们通过主的神性同在而出现。然而，它们并非源于神性或主，而是源于正受试探或折磨之人里面的邪恶与虚假。因为从主所发出的无非是神圣，也就是良善、真理和仁慈。这种神圣，也就是良善、真理和仁慈就是那些陷入邪恶与虚假之人所无法承受的，因为他们是对立面或反面。邪恶、虚假和仁慈的缺乏总是倾向于向这些神圣事物施暴；他们攻击神圣事物到什么程度，就被折磨到什么程度；他们攻击神圣事物，因而受到折磨时，以为是神性在折磨他们。这些事就是“似乎它们来自神性”这句话的意思。<br />古人都熟知，没有人面对面见耶和华还能存活；这种知识从他们传到雅各的后代那里。这解释了他们在见到天使仍能存活时为何如此高兴。如士师记：<br />基甸见他是耶和华的使者，就说，主耶和华啊！我不好了，因为我觌面看见耶和华的使者。因为我面对面看见了耶和华的使者。耶和华对他说，平安归于你，不要惧怕，你必不至死！（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.22.htm">6:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.23.htm">23</a>）<br /><br />玛挪亚对他的妻说，我们必要死，因为看见了神。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.22.htm">13:22</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你不能看见我的面，因为人见了我不能存活。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.20.htm">33:20</a>）<br />当经上论到摩西说，他与耶和华而面对面说话（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.11.htm">33:11</a>），还说他是耶和华面对面所认识的（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申34.10.htm">34:10</a>）时，意思是说，耶和华以适合他接受的人形，也就是外在形式向他显现，如我从天使那里获知，祂显为有胡须的老人，与他坐在一起。由于同样的原因，犹太人对耶和华没有其它概念，只以为祂是位极老的人，留着长长的雪白胡须，起其他神明，能行出更大的神迹。他们并没有把祂看成是最神圣的，因为他们不知道何为神圣。他们更不可能看到从祂发出的神圣，因为他们陷入肉体和世俗之爱，没有任何神圣的内在（<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4299</b></p><p><b>4299.</b>
For I have seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered. That this signifies that He endured the most grievous temptations as if they were from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "seeing 
God," as being an approach to Him through things interior, namely, goods and truths, hence denoting presence (see n. 4198); and from the signification of "faces," as being things interior (n. 1999, 
2434, 3527, 3573, 4066), consequently the thoughts and affections, for thoughts and affections are interior things, because they are of the animus and of the mind, and manifest themselves in the 
face; and from the signification of "my soul is delivered," as being to endure, namely, the Divine presence. That by all these things is signified that He endured the most grievous temptations as if they 
were from the Divine, cannot appear except from the causes of temptations both proximate and remote. The proximate causes are the evils and falsities in the man, which lead him into temptations, consequently 
the evil spirits and genii who pour them in (n. 4249). Nevertheless no one can be tempted (that is, undergo any spiritual temptation) except him who has conscience; for spiritual temptation 
is nothing else than torment of conscience; and consequently none can be tempted except those who are in celestial and spiritual good, for these have conscience, and all others have not, and do not 
even know what conscience is.  [2] Conscience is a new will and a new understanding from the Lord; thus it is the Lord's presence in a man; and this the nearer, in proportion as the man is in the affection 
of good or of truth. If the Lord's presence is nearer than in proportion as the man is in the affection of good or of truth, the man comes into temptation. The reason is that the evils and falsities 
which are in the man, tempered by the goods and truths that are in him, cannot endure a nearer presence. This may be seen from the things that take place in the other life: that evil spirits cannot 
possibly approach any heavenly society without beginning to feel anguish and torment; also that evil spirits cannot endure to have angels look upon them, for they are instantly tortured and fall into 
a swoon; and also from the fact that hell is remote from heaven, for the reason that it cannot endure heaven, that is, the Lord's presence which is in heaven. This is the reason why it is said of 
such in the Word: </p>
<p>     Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Hide us (Luke 23:30). And elsewhere: </p>
<p>     They shall say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall 
down upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne (Rev. 6:16). Moreover the foggy and pitch-dark sphere which exhales from the evils and falsities of those who are in hell 
appears like a mountain or rock, under which they are hidden (see n. 1265, 1267, 1270).  [3] From all this it can now be known that the words, "I have seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered," 
signify the most grievous temptations as if they were from the Divine. Temptations and torments appear as if from the Divine, because, as before said, they come forth through the Lord's Divine presence; 
but still they are not from the Divine, or from the Lord, but from the evils and falsities which are in him who is being tempted or tormented. For from the Lord nothing proceeds but the Holy which 
is good and true and merciful. This Holy, which is good and true and merciful, is what those who are in evils and falsities cannot endure, because they are opposites or contraries. Evils, falsities, 
and unmercifulness are continually intent upon doing violence to these holy things; and insofar as they assault them, so far they are tormented; and when they assault them, and are consequently tormented, 
they suppose that it is the Divine which torments them. These things are what are meant by the words "as if they were from the Divine."  [4] That no one can see Jehovah face to face, and live, 
was known to the ancients, and this knowledge was handed down from them to the posterity of Jacob; for which reason they rejoiced so greatly when they saw an angel and yet lived. As in the book of 
Judges: </p>
<p>     Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and therefore Gideon said, Lord Jehovih! Forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face. And Jehovah said unto him, Peace be unto 
thee, fear not, thou shalt not die (Judg. 6:22-23). In the same book: </p>
<p>     Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God (Judg. 13:22). And in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said 
unto Moses, Thou canst not see My faces, for man shall not see Me, and live (Exod. 33:20). [5] When it is said of Moses that he spoke with Jehovah face to face (Exod. 33:11), and that Jehovah knew him 
face to face (Deut. 34:10), the meaning is that Jehovah appeared to him in a human form adapted to his reception, which was external, namely, as an old man with a beard, sitting with him - as I have 
been instructed by the angels. It was from this also that the Jews had no other idea of Jehovah than as of a very old man, with a long and snowy beard, who could do greater miracles than other gods. 
Not that they accounted Him the most holy, for what holiness was they did not know; still less that they could by any possibility see the Holy that proceeds from Him, because they were in bodily and earthly 
love, without any holy internal (n. 4289, 4293). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4299</b></p><p><b>4299.</b>
'For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered' means that He suffered the severest temptations, seemingly attributable to the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing God' as going 
closer to Him by means of interior things, that is to say, by means of goods and truths, and consequently as presence, dealt with in <a href="4198.htm">4198</a>; and from the meaning of 'the face' as interior things, dealt 
with in <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2434.htm">2434</a>, <a href="3527.htm">3527</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="4066.htm">4066</a>, and so as thoughts and affections, for affections and thoughts are interior things because they belong to the disposition and mind (animus et mens) and reveal 
themselves in the face; and from the meaning of 'my soul is delivered' as suffering God's presence. The fact that all these words mean that He suffered the severest temptations seemingly attributable 
to the Divine, cannot be seen from anything else than the immediate causes and the remote causes of temptations. The evils and falsities present with a person which lead him into temptations, and therefore 
the evil spirits and genii who instill them are the immediate causes, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>. Nevertheless, no one can be tempted, that is, undergo any spiritual temptation, except him who has a conscience. Indeed 
spiritual temptation is nothing else than the torture of a person's conscience, and consequently none can be tempted but those who are governed by celestial and spiritual good. For the latter have 
conscience, but all others do not; indeed they do not even know what conscience is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Conscience is a new will and a new understanding received from the Lord, and so is the Lord's presence with 
a person, a presence which becomes all the closer the more the person is stirred by the affection for good or for truth. If the closeness of the Lord's presence exceeds the amount of affection for good 
or for truth in him, he enters into temptation. The reason why is that the evils and falsities which reside with him, and which are moderated by the goods and truths residing with him, cannot suffer 
that closer presence. This becomes clear from the following things that happen in the next life: Evil spirits cannot by any means move towards any heavenly community without starting to feel distress 
and torment; also, evil spirits cannot stand angels looking at them because they are instantly tormented and collapse unconscious. And in addition there is the fact that hell is remote from heaven, for 
the reason that it cannot suffer heaven, that is, the Lord's presence in heaven. This explains why in the Word it is said in reference to evil spirits, </p>
<blockquote>
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 
Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2023:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 23:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
They will say to the mountains and rocks, Rush down on us and hide us from the face of Him who is seated on the throne. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also the sphere of cloud and thick darkness which emanates from the evils and falsities of those in hell looks like a mountain or rock beneath which they are hidden, see <a href="1265.htm">1265</a>, <a href="1267.htm">1267</a>, <a href="1270.htm">1270</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
From these considerations it can now be recognized that 'I have seen God face to face and my soul is delivered' means the severest temptations, seemingly attributable to the Divine. Temptations 
and torments do seem to be attributable to the Divine because they arise, as has been stated, through the Lord's Divine presence Yet they do not originate in the Divine or the Lord but in the evils and 
falsities residing with the person who is being tempted or tormented. From the Lord nothing else proceeds but a holiness which is good and true and merciful, and it is this holiness - which is good, 
true, and merciful - that those subject to evils and falsities cannot suffer; for such evils and falsities are opposite or contrary to it. Evils, falsities, and lack of mercy are bent all the time on 
doing violence to those qualities belonging to holiness; and in the measure they assail these, they themselves suffer torment. And when they assail them and consequently suffer torment they imagine that 
it is the Divine who torments them. These are the considerations meant by 'seemingly attributable to the Divine'. </p>

<p><b>[4]</b>
 It was well known to the ancients that no one can see Jehovah face to face 
and live, and from them knowledge of the same came down to the descendants of Jacob. This explains why they were so glad when they saw any angel and remained alive, as in the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
Gideon 
saw that he was the angel of Jehovah, therefore Gideon said, O Lord Jehovih! Inasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face. And Jehovah said to him, Peace be to you; do not fear, for you 
will not die. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%206:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 6:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the same book, Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, for we have seen God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2013:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 13:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And in Moses, Jehovah said to Moses, You cannot see My face, for 
no man will see Me and live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2033:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 33:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The reason why it is said of Moses that he spoke to Jehovah face to face, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2033:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 33:11</a>, and that Jehovah knew him face to face, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2034:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 34:10</a>, is that He 
showed Himself to him in a human form suited to his reception, which was an external form - as a bearded old man sitting with him, as I have learned from angels. For the same reason the Jews had no other 
idea of Jehovah than of one who was very old with a long white beard, who was better able to perform miracles than other gods. They did not have the idea of His being the most holy because they did 
not know what holiness was, let alone that they could not in any way see the holiness proceeding from Him because they were governed by bodily and earthly love devoid of internal holiness, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>. </p>

`Quia vidi Deum facies ad facies, et liberata est anima mea': quod significet quod sustineret gravissimas tentationes, sicut forent a Divino, constat a significatione `videre Deum' quod sit pinquatio 
ad Ipsum per interiora, nempe bona et vera, inde praesentia, de qua n. 4198; et a significatione `facierum' quod sint interiora, de qua n. 1999, 2434, 3527, 3573, 4066, proinde cogitationes et 
affectiones, nam `hae et illae' sunt interiora {1}, de quia sunt animi (c)et mentis, et se manifestant in facie; et ex significatione `liberata anima mea' quod sit sustinere, nempe praesentiam Divinam: 
quod per illa omnia significetur quod sustineret gravissimas tentationes sicut forent a Divino, non aliunde constare potest quam a causis tentationum proximis et remotis; causae proximae sunt 
mala et falsa apud hominem, quae inducunt illum in tentationes, proinde mali spiritus (c)et genii qui infundunt, n. 4249; sed usque nemo tentari potest, hoc est, aliquam tentationem spiritualem subire, 
nisi qui conscientiam habet, tentatio enim spiritualis non aliud est quam cruciatus conscientiae, consequenter non alii possunt tentari quam qui in bono caelesti et {2} spirituali sunt, nam hi 
conscientiam habent, ceteri non habent, et ne quidem sciunt quid conscientia; [2] conscientia est nova voluntas et novus intellectus a Domino {3}; </p>
<p>ita est praesentia Domini apud hominem, et haec eo 
propior quo plus homo in affectione boni aut veri est; si praesentia Domini propior est quam quantum homo est in affectione boni aut {4} veri, venit homo in tentationem; causa est quia mala et falsa 
quae apud hominem, temperata eum bonis et veris apud illum, non sustinere possunt praesentiam propiorem; hoc {5} constare potest ab his quae existunt {6} in altera vita, nempe quod mali spiritus 
nequaquam possint approximare ad societatem aliquam caelestem quin incipiant angi et cruciari; tum {7} quod mali spiritus non sustineant quod angeli illos inspiciunt, ilico enim {8} torquentur et 
{9} in deliquium cadunt; et quoque ex eo quod infernum a caelo remotum sit, ex causa quia illud non sustinet caelum, hoc est, Domini praesentiam quae est in caelo; inde est quod in Verbo de illis dicatur,  
         (m)Tunc incipient dicere montibus, Cadite super nos, et      collibus, Occultate nos, Luc. xxiii 30; </p>
<p>et alibi,           Dicent montibus et petris, Ruite super nos, et      abscondite 
nos a facie sedentis super throno, Apoc. vi 16; </p>
<p>etiam nimbosa {10} et caliginosa sphaera quae exhalat a malis et falsis illorum qui in inferno, apparet instar montis seu petrae, sub qua absconduntur, 
videatur n. 1265, 1267, {11} 1270.(n)  Ex his nunc sciri potest quod `vidi Deum facies ad facies, et liberata est anima mea' significet gravissimas tentationes sicut forent a Divino: apparent 
tentationes et cruciatus sicut a Divino quia existunt per praesentiam Divinam Domini, ut dictum, sed usque non sunt a Divino seu Domino, sed a malis et falsis quae apud illum qua tentatur seu 
cruciatur; a Domino enim non nisi quam sanctum bonum et verum et misericors procedit, hoc sanctum nempe bonum, verum et misericors, est, quod {12} illi qui in malis et falsis sunt, sustinere non 
possunt, quia opposita seu contraria sunt; mala, {13} falsa, et immisericordia continue intendunt violare sancta illa, et quantum aggrediuntur illa, tantum cruciantur; et cum aggrediuntur et inde cruciantur, 
tunc putant quod Divinum sit quod cruciat; haec sunt quae intelliguntur per `sicut forent a Divino.'  [4] Quod nemo (t)possit videre Jehovam facie ad faciem et vivere, antiquis notum fuit, 
et inde cognitio ejus rei ad posteros Jacobi derivata est; </p>
<p>quapropter tantum gavisi sunt tum viderunt aliquem angelum, et tamen viverent; ut in Libro Judicum,           Vidit Gideon, quod angelus 
Jehovae, quare dixit Gideon,      Domine Jehovih, quandoquidem vidi angelum Jehovae faciem ad      faciem: et dixit illi Jehovah, Pax tibi, noli timere, quia      non morieris, vi 22, 23; </p>
<p>in eodem 
Libro,           Dixit Manoahus ad uxorem suam, Moriendo moriemur, quia      Deum vidimus, xiii 22; </p>
<p>et apud Mosen,           Jehovah dixit ad Mosen, Non poteris videre facies Meas      quia non

<p>[5] quod de Mose dicatur quod           Locutus cum Jehovah facie ad faciem, Exod. xxxiii 11,  et quod           Cognoverit illum Jehovah facie ad faciem, 
Deut.         xxxiv 10, est quod apparuerit illi in forma humana adaequata ejus receptioni quae fuit externa, nempe sicut vetustus barbatus sedens apud illum ut instructus sum ab angelis; inde 
etiam Judaei non aliam ideam de Jehovah habuerunt quam sicut de vetustissimo homine barbae longae et niveae, qui prae aliis diis miracula potuit facere; non quo sanctissimus, quia quid sanctum esset,
