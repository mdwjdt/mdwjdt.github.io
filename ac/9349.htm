<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9349节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9349.</strong>20-23章所论述的主题是从西乃山上所颁布的律法、典章和律例；并且已经说明它们在内义上包含什么，因而在天堂是如何被理解的；也就是说，它们不是照字义，而是照并未显现在文字中，但仍在文字中的灵义来理解的。人若不知道这事是怎么回事，可能以为这会使得圣言的字义显得无足轻重，因为它在天堂不被关注。但是，要知道，圣言的字义绝不会由此显得无足轻重，相反会得到确认、强化；并且每句话都从它里面的灵义获得分量，变得神圣；因为字义是灵义赖以存在的基础和支撑，并与灵义直接联结，且联结得如此紧密，以致就圣言的文字而言，甚至连一点一画也无不包含神圣和神性之物在里面，正如主在下列经文中所说的：<br />我实在告诉你们：就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，直到一切都实现。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.18.htm">5:18</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />天地废去较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.17.htm">16:17</a>）<br />“律法”就是圣言（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="7462.htm">7462</a>节）。<br />因此，按照主的神性治理，自圣言被写成之时起，圣言，尤其旧约圣言，其一点一画一直保存下来。我从天上被指示，在圣言中，不仅每句话，而且每个字，令人难以置信的是，甚至原文中一个字的一点一画都含有至内层天堂的天使所能感知的某种神圣之物。我可以肯定地说事实的确如此；不过，我知道这会超出想象。由此明显可知，教会的外在仪式代表主，以及天堂和教会的内在事物，这些内在事物始于主，是旧约圣言论述的主题；这些仪式大部分的确已经被废除，但圣言仍保持在它的神性圣洁中；因为如前所述，其中的一切细节仍含有神圣的神性事物在里面；当阅读圣言时，这些事物在天堂就被感知到。事实上，圣言的每一个细节里面都含有一个神圣的内在，也就是它的内义，或说它的天上神性意义。这层意义是圣言的灵魂；它是从主发出的神之真理本身，因而就是主自己。<br />由此可见主从西乃山上所颁布，并包含在20-23章中，一直在被解释的律法、典章和律例是何情形。也就是说，其中的每一条规定都是神圣的，因为它的内在形式是神圣的。然而，就作为一个内在教会的当今教会的通常做法而言，其中有些已经被废除了；有些具有这样的性质：教会若愿意，可能会用到它们；有些则必须完全被遵守和执行。即使如此，那些就教会的通常做法而言已经被废除的，和那些教会若愿意，可能会用到的，以及那些必须完全被遵守和执行的，都凭其内在的神圣内容而同等神圣；因为整部圣言内在都是神性。这内在的神圣内容就是内义所教导的，和仁与信的教义所教导的基督教会的内在事物是一样的。<br />为使这一切更容易理解，我们以上述章节所论述的律法、典章和律例为例来说明。必须完全被遵守和执行的规定，就是包含在这些经文（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.3.htm">20:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.7.htm">7</a>，<a

In chapters 20-23, the laws, judgments, and statutes, that were promulgated from Mount Sinai, have been treated of, and it has been shown what they contain in the internal sense, thus how they are perceived 
in heaven; namely, not according to the literal sense, but according to the spiritual sense, which is not apparent in the letter, but still is within it. One who does not know how this is, may 
indeed suppose that the Word as to its literal sense is thus annihilated, because in heaven no attention is paid to it. But be it known that the literal sense of the Word is by no means thereby annihilated; 
but is indeed rather confirmed; and that each word has weight, and is holy, from the spiritual sense which is within; because the literal sense is the basis and support on which the spiritual 
sense rests, and with which it coheres in the closest conjunction, insomuch that there is not even a jot or point, or a little horn, in the letter of the Word, which does not contain within it the holy 
Divine; according to the words of the Lord in these passages: </p>
<p>     Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one little horn shall not pass away from the law, till all things 
be done (Matt. 5:18); </p>
<p>     It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one point in the law to fail (Luke 16:17). (That "the law" denotes the Word, see n. 6752, 7463.) [2] Therefore 
also it has come to pass through the Divine providence of the Lord, that the Word, especially the Word of the Old Testament, has been preserved in respect to every jot and point from the time when it 
was written. It has also been shown from heaven, that in the Word not only every expression, but also every syllable, and what seems incredible, every little horn of a syllable in the original tongue 
infolds in it something holy, which becomes perceptible to the angels of the inmost heaven. That this is the case I am able to affirm; but I know that it transcends belief. From this it is evident that 
the outward rituals of the church, which represented the Lord and the internal things of heaven and the church that are from the Lord, and which are treated of in the Word of the Old Testament, have 
indeed been for the most part abrogated, but that the Word nevertheless remains in its Divine sanctity; because, as before said, each and all things therein still infold holy Divine things, which are 
perceived in heaven while the Word is being read; for in every detail there is a holy internal which is its internal sense; that is, its heavenly and Divine sense. This sense is the soul of the Word, 
and it is truth Divine itself proceeding from the Lord; thus it is the Lord Himself. [3] From all this it can be seen how the case is with the laws, judgments, and statutes promulgated by the Lord from 
Mount Sinai, and which are contained in chapters 20-23, which have been explained; namely, that each and all things therein are holy because they are holy in their internal form; but that nevertheless 
some of them have been abrogated in respect to present use where the church is, which is an internal church. Some of them however are of such a nature that they may serve a use if one so pleases; 
and some of them are to be altogether observed and done. And yet those which have been abrogated in respect to use where the church is, and those which may serve a use if one so pleases, and also those 
which are to be altogether observed and done, are equally holy in their holy internal; for in its bosom the whole Word is Divine. This holy internal is that which the internal sense teaches, and is 
the same as the internal things of the Christian Church, which the doctrine of charity and faith teaches. [4] In order that what has been said may be placed within the apprehension, let us take for illustration 
the laws, judgments, and statutes treated of in the aforesaid chapters. Those which are to be altogether observed and done are those contained in Exod. 20:3-5, 7, 8, 12-17, 23; in Exod. 21:12, 
14, 15, 20; in Exod. 22:18-20, 28; and in Exod. 23:1-3, 6-8, 24-25, 32. Those which may serve a use if one so pleases, are such as are contained in Exod. 20:10; in Exod. 21:18, 19, 22-25, 33-36; 
in Exod. 22:1-14, 17, 21-23, 25-27, 31; and in Exod. 23:4, 5, 9, 12-16, 33. And those which have been abrogated in respect to present use where the church is, are contained in Exod. 20:24-26; 21:2-11, 
16, 21, 26-29, 31, 32; in Exod. 22:15, 29, 30; and in Exod. 23:10, 11, 17-19. But, as before said, both the latter and the former are equally holy, that is, are equally the Divine Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9349</b></p><p><b>9349.</b>
The subject in Chapters <a href="20.htm">20</a>-<a href="23.htm">23</a> has been the laws, judgements, and statutes that were declared from Mount Sinai. It has been shown what these hold within them in the internal sense, and so how they are 
understood in heaven, namely not according to their literal but according to their spiritual meaning, which though not evident in the letter is nevertheless present within them. But anyone who is unaware 
of how the matter stands may suppose that this makes the literal sense of the Word unimportant, for no attention is paid to it in heaven. But let it be known that it does not at all make the literal 
sense of the Word unimportant; rather, it adds strength to it. Indeed all its individual words carry weight and are holy by virtue of the spiritual sense within them; for the literal sense is the 
foundation and support on which the spiritual sense rests, and with which it is directly linked, so directly that not even a jot, nor a tittle, that is, small part of a letter in the literal sense of 
the Word fails to hold what is holy and Divine within it, according to the Lord's words in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Truly I say to you, Even until heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one small part of a letter 
will not pass from the law till all things are done. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the Law to fall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The Law' 
is the Word, see <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="7463.htm">7463</a>. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Therefore also in the Lord's Divine Providence it has happened that every jot and tittle of the Word, especially in the Old Testament, has been preserved since it was 
written. I have been shown from heaven that in the Word not only each word but also each letter, indeed - incredibly so - each small part of a letter in the original language has an inner holiness, as 
angels of the inmost heaven are able to perceive. I can positively declare this to be so, but I realize that it surpasses belief. From this it is evident that outward religious observances of the Church, 
which represented the Lord and the inner realities of heaven and the Church which begin in the Lord, and about which one reads in the Old Testament Word, have indeed for the most part been abrogated. 
But it continues to be the Word with its Divine holiness, because all the details there, as has been stated, continue to hold within themselves holy and Divine things, which are perceived in heaven 
when that Word is read. For it has in all its details an inner, holy content, which is its internal sense , or heavenly and Divine sense. This sense is the soul of the Word; it is God's truth itself 
emanating from the Lord, and so it is the Lord Himself.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 All this makes clear what the situation is with the laws, judgements, and statutes which were declared by the Lord from Mount Sinai, and 
are contained in Chapters <a href="20.htm">20</a>-<a href="23.htm">23</a> which have now been dealt with. That is to say, it makes clear that every single regulation there is holy because its inward form is holy. Nevertheless some of them 
have been abrogated so far as practices by the Church at the present day, which is an internal Church, are concerned; some of them are such that the Church may practise them if it wishes to do so; and 
some of them must be altogether observed and carried out. Even so, those which have been abrogated so far as practices by the Church are concerned, those which it may practise if it so wishes, and those 
which must be altogether observed and carried out are all equally holy by virtue of their inner and holy content. For the whole of the Word internally is Divine. That inner and holy content is what 
the internal sense teaches, and it is identical with the inner virtues of the Christian Church, with which teachings about charity and faith are concerned.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 To make all this more intelligible 
let the laws, judgements, and statutes dealt with in the above-mentioned chapters serve as examples. Regulations which must be altogether observed and carried out are those contained in 20:3-5, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>-<a href="17.htm">17</a>, <a href="23.htm">23</a>; 21:12, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>; 22:18-20, <a href="28.htm">28</a>; 23:1-3, <a href="6.htm">6</a>-<a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="32.htm">32</a>.  Regulations which [the Church] may practise if it so wishes are such as those contained in 20:10; 21:18, <a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="22.htm">22</a>-<a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="33.htm">33</a>-<a href="36.htm">36</a>; 22:1-14, 
<a href="17.htm">17</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a>-<a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>-<a href="27.htm">27</a>, <a href="31.htm">31</a>; 23:4, <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>-<a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="33.htm">33</a>.  Regulations which have been abrogated so far as practices by the Church at the present day are concerned, in 20:24-26; 21:2-11, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>-<a href="29.htm">29</a>, <a href="31.htm">31</a>, <a href="32.htm">32</a>;

ibi usque involvunt sancta Divina, quae in caelo, dum legitur id Verbum, percipiuntur; est enim internum sanctum in singulis, quod est sensus ejus internus, seu sensus caelestis et Divinus; hic sensus 
est anima Verbi, et est ipsum verum Divinum procedens a Domino, ita Ipse Dominus. 	[3] Ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum legibus, judiciis, et statutis quae a Domino promulgata sunt e 
monte Sinai, et quae in capitibus xx-(x)xxiii, (o)de quibus actum est, continentur, quod nempe omnia et singula ibi sancta sint quia in interna forma sancta sunt; sed usque quod quaedam eorum abrogata 
sint quoad usum hodie ubi Ecclesia, quae est Ecclesia interna, quaedam autem eorum sunt talia ut possint servire usui si ita libet, et quaedam eorum omnino observanda et facienda (o)sunt; sed usque quae 
abrogata sunt quoad usum ubi Ecclesia, et quae servire possunt usui si ita libet, ut et quae omnino observanda et facienda, aeque sancta sunt ex {6} sancto interno, nam Verbum totum quantum in sinu 
suo est Divinum; sanctum internum est quod docet sensus internus, et est idem cum internis Ecclesiae Christianae, quae doctrina charitatis et fidei docet. 	[4] Ut haec ad captum sistantur, sint (x)illustrationi 
leges, judicia, et statuta de quibus in praedictis capitibus: quae ibi omnino (x)observanda et facienda, sunt quae continentur in xx 3-5, 7, 8, 12-14, 20, xxi 12, 14, 15, 20, xxii 17-19, 
27 [A.V. 18-20, 28], xxiii 1-3, 6-8, 24, 25, 32 quae servire possunt usui si libet sunt talia quae continentur in xx 10, xxi 18, 19, 22-25, 33-36, 37 [A.V. xxii 1], xxii 1-13, 16, 20-22, 24-26, 30 [A.V. 
2-14, 17, 21-23, 25-27, 31], xxiii 4, 5, 9, 12-16, 33 quae autem abrogata sunt quoad usum hodie ubi Ecclesia, xx 21-23, xxi 2-11, 16, 21, 26-29, 31, 32, xxii 14, 28, 29 [A.V. 15, 29, 30], xxiii 10,
