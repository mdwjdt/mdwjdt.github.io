<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3970节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3970.</strong>创世记30:25，26.拉结生约瑟之后，雅各对拉班说，请打发我走，叫我回到我本乡本地去。请你把我服事你所得的女眷和孩子给我，让我走；我怎样服事你，你都知道。<br />“拉结生约瑟之后”表对约瑟所代表的属灵层的承认。“雅各对拉班说”表属世真理的良善转向来自一个神性源头的旁系良善（parallel good），内层便通过这良善被联结起来。“请打发我走，叫我回到我本乡本地去”表那时雅各所代表的属世层中有一种强烈的渴望，想要达到它与理性层的神性结合的状态。“请你把（我的）女眷给我”表对真理的情感属于属世层。“孩子”表由这些情感所生的真理也是。“我服事你所得的”表凭祂自己的能力。“让我走”表与理性层中的神性结合。“我怎样服事你，你都知道”表出于祂自己的能力的劳碌和努力。</p>

Verses 25, 26. And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, and I will go to my place, and to my land. Give me my females, and my children, for whom I have 
served thee, and I will go; for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee. "And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph," signifies the acknowledgment of the spiritual represented 
by Joseph; "that Jacob said unto Laban," signifies the good of natural truth to the collateral good from a Divine origin, by means of which there is a conjunction of the interiors; "send me away, and 
I will go to my place, and to my land," signifies that there was then a longing of the natural represented by Jacob, for a state of conjunction with the Divine of the rational; "give me my females," signifies 
that the affections of truth belonged to the natural; "and my children," signifies that so did the truths thence derived; "for whom I have served thee," signifies from His own power; "and I will 
go," signifies conjunction with the Divine rational; "for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee," signifies labor and study by His own power. </p>

Verses 25, 26 And it happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away and let me go to my own place and to my own land. Give me my womenfolk and my children for whom I have 
served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you. </p>
<p>'It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph' means acknowledgement of the spiritual represented by Joseph. 'That 
Jacob said to Laban' means the good of natural truth turned to the parallel good from a Divine origin, by means of which good interior things are joined together. 'Send me away and let me go to my own 
place and to my own land' means that at that time there was in the natural represented by Jacob a strong desire to arrive at a state in which it would be joined to everything Divine in the Rational. 
'Give me my womenfolk' means that the affections for truth belonged to that natural. 'And my children' means as did the truths born from those affections. 'For whom I have served you' means from His own 
power. 'And let me go' means to be joined to everything Divine in the Rational. 'For you know my service with which I have served you' means toil and endeavour from His own power. </p>

Vers. 25, 26.  Et factum, cum peperisset Rachel Josephum, et dixit Jacob ad Laban, Mitte me et eam ad locum meum et ad terram meam.  Da feminas meas, et natos meos, quod servivi tibi pro illis, et 
eam, quia tu nosti servitium meum, quo servivi tibi.  `Factum cum peperisset Rachel Josephum' significat agnitionem spiritualis per Josephum repraesentati: `et dixit Jacob ad Laban' significat veri 
naturalis bonum ad bonum collaterale ab origine Divina, per quod conjunctio interiorum: `mitte me et eam ad locum meum et ad terram meam' significat quod tunc desiderium naturalis per Jacobum repraesentati 
ad statum conjunctionis cum Divino Rationalis: `da feminas meas' significat quod affectiones veri ejus essent: `et natos meos significat etiam vera inde: `quod servivi tibi pro illis' significat 
ex propria potentia: `et eam' significat conjunctionem cum Divino Rationalis: `quia tu nosti servitium meum, quo servivi tibi' significat laborem et studium ex potentia propria. </p>
