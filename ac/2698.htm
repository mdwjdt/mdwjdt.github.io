<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2698节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2698.</strong>“把你的手握在他里面”表由此而来的支持。这从“握”和“手”的含义清楚可知：“握”是指给予支持；“手”是指力量（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节），它是支持的源头。“在他里面”，即在这孩子里面，表示来自它，即来自真理的属灵之物。那些因损失真理而经历内在悲伤，甚至绝望的人唯独被真理提升和支持，因为他们正是为此而感到悲伤绝望。对那些具有对良善的情感之人来说，他们的良善渴望良善，如同一个饥饿的人渴望食物。而对那些具有对真理的情感之人来说，他们的良善则渴望真理，如同一个口渴的人渴望水。若不通过内义，没人理解此处“把你的手握在他里面”是什么意思。</p>

And strengthen thy hand in him. That this signifies support from it, is evident from the signification of "being strengthened," as meaning to be supported; and from the signification of the "hand," as 
being power (see n. 878), which relates to support. "In him," that is, in the child, means from it, that is, from the spiritual as to truth. They who are in internal grief, and in despair from the privation 
of truth, are elevated and sustained solely by truth, because it is for this that they have grief and despair. With those who are in the affection of good, their good desires good as one hungers 
for bread; but with those who are in the affection of truth, their good desires truth, as one thirsts for water. What "strengthening the hand in him" here means, will not be understood by anyone except 
from the internal sense. </p>

'And strengthen your hand in him' means support received from this. This is clear from the meaning of 'being strengthened' as being given support, and from the meaning of 'hand' as power, dealt with 
in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, which is the source of support. 'In him', that is, in the boy, means from it, that is to say, from the spiritual as regards truth. Those who experience internal grief and experience despair because 
truth is taken away from them are uplifted and supported solely by truth, for it is for that same truth that they suffer grief and despair. In the case of those governed by an affection for good, 
the good with them desires good, as a person hungers for bread; but in the case of those governed by an affection for truth the good with them desires truth as a person thirsts for water. What 'strengthening 
your hand in him' means here will not be understood by anyone except from the internal sense. </p>

</p><b>2698.</b>
`Et corrobora manum tuam in illo': quod significet sustentationem inde, constat a significatione `corroborari' quod sit sustentari, et a significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878, quae 
est sustentationis; `in illo,' seu puero, est inde, nempe ex spirituali quoad verum: qui in dolore interno sunt ac in desperatione ex privatione  veri ii elevantur et sustentantur unice per verum, quia 
de hoc illis dolor et desperatio: (o)qui in affectione boni sunt, bonum apud eos desiderat bonum sicut esuriens panem, qui autem in affectione veri sunt, bonum apud eos desiderat verum, sicut sitiens 
aquam. Quid hic `corroborare manum in illo,' non alicui intellectum erit nisi a sensu interno. </p>
