<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6766节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6766.</strong>“他说，谁立你作我们的人，首领和审判官呢”表对他还没有如此深入教会真理，以致他能解决教会里的纷争的一种觉知。这从“他说”、“人，首领”和“审判官”的含义清楚可知。“他说”是指觉知，如前频繁所述。“人，首领”是指掌握首要真理，因而在真理的教义上更蒙光照的人；这样一个人在代表性教会由“首领”来表示，因此，“谁立你作人，首领”表示他还没有如此深入教会真理；“首领”表示那些掌控首要真理的人（参看<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）。“审判官”是指解决纷争或分歧的人，此处的纷争是指教会里的纷争，因为争斗发生在两个希伯来人之间，“希伯来人”表示那些属教会的人。<br />就至高意义而言，所论述的主题一直是神之律法在主的人身里面的开始；现在论述的主题则是该律法的发展。但就内义而言，现在所论述的主题是存在于正在重生之人那里的神性真理的发展。这种发展具有这样的性质：一开始，此人能分辨虚假和真理；他所拥有的真理能使他看清虚假，因为它是真理的对立面。但在这初期阶段，他无法解决教会里信之真理之间的分歧。为了能够做到这一点，他必须进一步发展，因为人的启示是逐渐增长的。这一点从少年人和年轻人很清楚地看出来，他们认为他们教会的教义是绝对的真理，并利用这些教义来判断虚假；但他们还不能解决教会里信之事务之间的分歧；这种能力通过一系列阶段才能达到。正因如此，能被赋予这种能力的人必须在年纪上更加成熟，必须拥有被启示的理解力的内层。</p>

And he said, Who set thee for a man, a prince, and a judge over us? That this signifies perception that he was not as yet so far advanced in the truths of faith as to settle differences within the church, 
is evident from the signification of "he said," as being perception (of which often above); and from the signification of "a man a prince," as being one who is in primary truths, thus who has been 
preeminently enlightened in the doctrine of truth. Such a one was meant in the representative church by "a prince," and hence by the words "Who set thee for a man, a prince?" is signified that he was 
not yet so far advanced in the truths of the church (that a "prince" is one in primary truths, see n. 5044). And from the significance of a "judge," as being one who settles disputes or differences, 
here differences within the church, because between two Hebrew men, by whom are signified those who are of the church. [2] In the supreme sense the subject treated of has been the beginnings of the 
law Divine in the Lord's Human, and now the subject treated of is the progress of this law; but in the internal sense the subject treated of now is the progress of Divine truth with the man who is being 
regenerated. This progress is such that the man is for the first time enabled to discriminate between falsity and truth; for from the truth in which he is he can see falsity, because it is opposite; 
but he cannot at this first time settle differences between the truths of faith within the church; in order to be able to do this he must make further progress, for man is enlightened successively. 
This is very evident from youths and young men, who believe the doctrinal things of their church to be truth itself, and from these judge of falsities, but as yet are not able to settle differences between 
matters of faith within the church. This ability comes by degrees; and therefore a man to whom this is possible must be of a more advanced age, and must have the interiors of his understanding 
enlightened. </p>

'And he said, Who set you up as a man-prince and a judge over us?' means a perception that he was not yet so advanced into the truths of the Church' that he could settle disagreements within the Church.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
This is clear from the meaning of 'he said' as a perception, dealt with often; from the meaning of 'a man-prince' as one who has a command of primary truths, thus who is more enlightened than others 
in teachings about the truth (for that is what was meant in the representative Church by 'a prince') and therefore 'who set you up as a man-prince?' means that he was not yet so advanced into the 
truths of the Church (for the meaning of 'prince' as those who have a command of primary truths, see <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>); and from the meaning of 'a judge' as one who settles disputes or disagreements. Here they are 
disagreements within the Church because it is a quarrel between 'two Hebrew men', by whom those belonging to the Church are meant.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the highest sense the subject has been the beginnings of 
the law of God within the Lord's Human; and now it is the development of that law. But in the internal sense the subject here is the development of Divine Truth as it exists with the person who is being 
regenerated. Its development is such that at first the person can distinguish falsity from truth, for the truth he has enables him to see falsity since it is the opposite of the truth. But he cannot 
at that early stage settle between one truth of faith and another within the Church. To be able to do this he must make further advances; for a person's enlightenment increases gradually. This is clearly 
recognizable from those who are in adolescent years and at the start of manhood. They think that the teachings of their Church are the absolute truth, and these they use to distinguish falsities. 
But they are not yet able to reconcile matters of faith within the Church when these disagree with one another; that ability comes in a sequence of stages. This being so, the person to whom that ability 
can be given must also be someone who is rather more mature in years, someone in whom the more internal levels of the understanding have been enlightened.
