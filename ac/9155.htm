<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9155节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9155.</strong>“要看看他有没有把手伸向同伴的财物”表看看它们有没有进入那良善。这从“他没有把手伸向”和“同伴的财物”的含义清楚可知：“他没有把手伸向”是指良善有没有使它们服从它自己的控制和权柄；“同伴的财物”是指被夺走的真理和记忆知识，因为被交付某人保管，却被偷去的银钱和器皿就是那“同伴的财物”所指的。“银钱和器皿”表示真理和记忆知识（参看<a href="9149.htm">9149</a>节）。由此明显可知，“要看看他有没有把手伸向同伴的财物”表示看看良善有没有使真理和记忆知识，就是被夺走的真理和记忆知识，服从它自己的控制和权柄；因而看看这些以前有没有进入良善，正如刚才所示（<a href="9154.htm">9154</a>节）。“手”表示权柄或能力（That "the hand" denotes power，参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5296.htm">5296</a>，<a href="6292.htm">6292</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>节）；“在手中”是指与某人同住并存在于他里面的东西（<a href="9133.htm">9133</a>节）。</p>

To see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work. That this signifies to see whether they have entered into good, is evident from the signification of "whether he hath put his hand," as being 
whether good has caused to be of its own right and power; and from the signification of "in his companion's work," as being the truth and memory-knowledge which have been taken away; for the silver 
and vessels that were given to be taken care of, and were stolen, are what are called the "companion's work." (That the "silver and vessels" denote truths and memory-knowledges, see above, n. 9149.) 
From this it is evident that by "to see whether the lord of the house hath put his hand to his companion's work" is signified whether good has caused to be of its own right and power the truths and memory-knowledges 
that had been taken away; thus whether these had previously entered into good (according to what was shown just above, n. 9154). (That "the hand" denotes power, see n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 
5296, 6292, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8153; also that "in the hand" denotes that which is with anyone and in anyone, n. 9133.) </p>

'[To see] whether or not he has put his hand into his companion's property' means whether it has entered into that good. This is clear from the meaning of 'whether or not he has put his hand' as whether 
good has made them subject to its own control and power; and from the meaning of 'into his companion's property' as truth and factual knowledge that have been taken away, for the silver and vessels, 
which have been delivered to someone for safe keeping but have been taken away, are what 'companion's property' refers to. For the meaning of 'silver and vessels' as truths and factual knowledge, see 
above in <a href="9149.htm">9149</a>. From this it is evident that 'whether or not the master of the house has put his hand into his companion's property' means whether good has made truths and factual knowledge subject 
to its own control and power - the truths and factual knowledge that have been taken away - thus whether these had previously entered into good, according to what has been shown immediately above in <a href="9154.htm">9154</a>. 
For the meaning of 'hand' as power, see <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5296.htm">5296</a>, <a href="6292.htm">6292</a>, <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>, <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>, <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>, and for 'in the hand' as that which resides with and within someone, <a href="9133.htm">9133</a>.  </p>

</p><b>9155.</b>
`Annon miserit manum suam in opus socii sui': quod significet num in illud intraverit {1}, constat ex significatione `annon miserit manum suam' quod sit num bonum sui juris ac potentiae fecerit, et 
ex significatione `in opus socii' quod sit verum ac scientificum quae ablata {2}; argentum enim et vasa ad custodiendum data, et furto ablata, sunt quae {3} vocantur `opus socii'; quod `argentum' et `vasa' 
sint vera et scientifica, videatur supra n. 9149; inde patet quod per `annon dominus domus miserit manum suam in opus socii sui' significetur num bonum sui juris ac potentiae fecerit vera et scientifica 
quae ablata sunt, ita num haec intraverint prius in bonum, secundum illa quae nunc supra n. 9154 ostensa sunt; quod `manus' sit potentia, videatur n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5296, 6292, 7188, 7189, 
7518, 7673, 8153, {4} quod `in manu' sit, quod (o)est apud aliquem et in aliquo, n. 9133. @1 intraverint altered to intraverit cp n. 9148$ @2 quod ablatum$ @3 i hic$ @4 i et$ </p>
