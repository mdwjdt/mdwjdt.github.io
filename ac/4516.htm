<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4516节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4516.</strong>“你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中有了臭名”表那些属古教会的人憎恶他们。这从“连累我，使我有臭名”和“这地的居民”的含义清楚可知：“连累我，使我有臭名”是指让他们感到憎恶；“这地的居民”在此是指那些属古教会的人，“地”表示教会（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节），因而“这地的居民”是指那些属教会的人，在此是指那些属古教会的人，因为古教会仍继续存在于迦南地的某些民族当中。直到这个古教会完全灭亡之后，教会的代表才建立在源于雅各的百姓或人民当中。这一事实也由雅各的后代不被允许进入迦南地，直到那地的居民罪孽满盈，如创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.16.htm">15:16</a>）所述。因为在前教会荒废之前，新教会不会得以建立</p>

Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink to the inhabitant of the land. That this signifies that they who were of the Ancient Church would abhor them, is evident from the signification of "troubling 
me, to make me to stink," as being to cause them to feel abhorrence; and from the signification of "the inhabitant of the land," as here being those who were of the Ancient Church, for by the "land" is 
signified the church (see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447), thus by the "inhabitant of the land," those who were of the church, here of the Ancient Church, because 
this still remained among some nations in the land of Canaan. The representative of a church was not instituted among the people sprung from Jacob until after this Ancient Church had altogether 
perished, which is also signified by the fact that the descendants of Jacob were not admitted into the land of Canaan until the iniquity of the inhabitants of the land had been consummated, as is said 
in Genesis 15:16; for no new church is set up until the former one has been vastated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4516</b></p><p><b>4516.</b>
'You have brought trouble on me, by making me stink to the inhabitant of the land' means that those who belonged to the Ancient Church abominated them. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing trouble 
on me, by making me stink' as causing them to abominate, and from the meaning of 'the inhabitant of the land' here as those who belonged to the Ancient Church. For 'the land' means the Church, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, and so 'the inhabitant of the land' those who belong to the Church, which in this case is the Ancient Church since that Church 
continued to exist among some nations in the land of Canaan. But that which was a representative of the Church was not established among the people descended from Jacob until that Ancient Church had 
completely come to an end. This fact is also meant by those descended from Jacob not being allowed into the land of Canaan until the iniquity of the inhabitants of the land had come to a close, as stated 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:16</a>. For no new Church is ever established until the previous one has been laid waste. </p>

`Perturbastis me ad fetere faciendum me habitatori terrae': </p>
<p>quod significet quod abominarentur illi qui ab Ecclesia Antiqua, constat a significatione `perturbare me ad fetere faciendum me' quod sit 
facere ut abominentur; (o)et ex significatione `habitatoris terrae' quod hic sint illi qui ab Ecclesia Antiqua; </p>
<p>per `terram' enim significatur Ecclesia, n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 
2117, 2118 f., 2928, 3355, 4447, ita per `habitatorem terrae' illi qui ab Ecclesia, hic ab Ecclesia Antiqua, quia haec adhuc apud aliquas gentes in terra Canaane perstabat; </p>
<p>apud {1} populum e Jacobo 
non prius institutum fuit repraesentativum Ecclesiae quam cum Antiqua illa prorsus periit; </p>
<p>quod etiam significatur per id quod posteri ex Jacobo non prius in terram Canaanem admissi fuerint, quam 
cum consummata est iniquitas habitatorum terrae {2}, sicuti dicitur Gen. xv 16; non enim prius aliqua nova Ecclesia instauratur quam cum prior vastata est.      @1 i et$      @2 ibi$ </p>
