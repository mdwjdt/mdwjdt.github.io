<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9971节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9971.</strong>当被问及他们所拜的神时，他们回答说，他们拜一位既可见又不可见的神，一个在人的形式之下的可见之神和一个不在任何形式之下的不可见的神。我从他们所说的话，以及他们传给我的思维观念发现，他们的可见之神就是我们的主自己；事实上，他们也称祂为主。对此，我被允许回答说，我们地球上也拜一位可见的神和一位不可见的神；不可见的神被称为父，可见的神被称为主；但这二者为一，如祂自己教导我们的，祂说，没有人看见过父的形状，但父与祂为一；凡看见祂的，就看见了父；父在祂里面，祂在父里面；因此，为神性的这二者存在于一个位格里面。这些都是主自己的话（参看约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">5:37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）。</p>

Being questioned about the God whom they worship, they answered that they worship a visible and an invisible God; a visible God under a human form, and an invisible God not under any form. And it was 
found from their speech, and also from the ideas of their thought when communicated to me, that their visible God is our Lord Himself, and they also called Him "the Lord." To all this it was given me 
to reply that on our earth also a visible and an invisible God is worshiped, and that the invisible God is called "the Father;" and the visible God, "the Lord;" but that the two are One, as He Himself 
taught us, saying, that "no one hath ever seen the shape of the Father," but that "the Father and He are One," that "whosoever seeth Him, seeth the Father," that "the Father is in Him, and He in the 
Father;" consequently that both are this Divine in one person. (That these are the words of the Lord Himself, see John 5:37; 10:30; 14:7, 9-11.) </p>

When asked about the God they worshipped they replied that they worshipped God the visible and the invisible, the visible God under the human form and the invisible God under no form at all. I realized 
from what they said, as well as from the ideas in their minds that were conveyed to me, that their visible God was our Lord Himself; indeed they called Him the Lord. I was allowed to reply that on 
our planet also God the visible and the invisible is worshipped, and that the invisible God is called the Father and the visible the Lord, but that the two are one. This He Himself has taught us, saying 
that no one has ever seen the Father's shape, but that the Father and He are one, and that whoever has seen Him has seen the Father, and that the Father is in Him and He is in the Father, consequently 
that these two who are Divine exist in one person. These are the Lord's own words, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:37;%2010:30;%2014:7,%209-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:37; 10:30; 14:7, 9-11</a>.  </p>

Interrogati sunt de Deo Quem colerent, ad quod respondebant quod colerent Deum visibilem et invisibilem, Deum visibilem sub forma humana ac Deum invisibilem non sub aliqua forma; et compertum est ex 
loquela eorum, et quoque ex ideis cogitationis eorum mecum communicatis, quod Deus visibilis esset Ipse noster Dominus, et quoque vocabant Ipsum Dominum; ad haec respondere datum est quod etiam in nostra 
tellure colatur Deus visibilis et invisibilis, et quod Deus invisibilis dicatur Pater, et visibilis Dominus; sed quod uterque unum sint, sicut Ipse nos docuit, dicendo quod speciem Patris nunquam 
viderint, at quod Pater et Ipse unum sint, et quod qui vidit Ipsum videat Patrem, et quod Pater in Ipso et Ipse in Patre; consequenter quod utrumque id Divinum in una persona sit. Quod illa Ipsius Domini 
verba sint, videatur Joh. v 37, x 30, xiv 7, 9-11. </p>
