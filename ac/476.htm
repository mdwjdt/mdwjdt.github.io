<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第476节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>476.</strong>“男女”用来表信与爱的结合，这一点在前面已说明和证实，并表明，“男“或“男人”表“知“（understanding，觉知），以及属于知的一切，因而表信的一切；而“女”或“女人”表“意”（“will，意愿），以及属于意的一切，因而表爱的一切；因此她被称为“夏娃”，一个唯独属于爱、表示生命的名字。因此“女“也用来表示教会，如前所述；“男”表示教会之人（vir）。这里说的是教会属灵的状态，后来被造为属天，所以，如1:26-27 那样，先说“男”，后说“女”。“创造”（create）也用来表述属灵之人，当完成（信与爱的）结合，也就是教会被“做成”（made）属天时，就不再说“男女”，而是说“人”（ man [homo]），“人”通过“男女”的结合象征二者。因此接下来说“祂称其名为‘人’”，以“人”表上古教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]476.</strong> The symbolism of male and female as the marriage between faith and love has been stated and demonstrated before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54" target=_top>54-55</a>]. The male or a man symbolizes the intellect and everything connected with it, so it symbolizes the qualities of faith. The female symbolizes the will or the properties of the will, so it symbolizes the qualities of love. This is also why the woman was named Eve from [the Hebrew word for] life, which belongs exclusively to love.<br />As a further result, a female also symbolizes the church, again as shown earlier, and a male symbolizes the individual of the church [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_253" target=_top>253</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_288" target=_top>288</a>].<br />The subject here is the state of the church when it was spiritual, although it soon became heavenly. This is why male comes first, just as it did in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_26-27" target=_top>Genesis 1:26-27</a>. The word create also has to do with a spiritual person. Immediately afterward, however, when the marriage was complete or, in other words, the church had developed a heavenly character, they are called not male and female but Human Being, meaning both, because of the marriage. This is why the next words are and he called their name Human Being, which symbolizes the church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 476</b></p><p><b>476.</b>
That by "male and female" is signified the marriage between faith and love was declared and proved above, where it was shown that the male or man [vir] signifies the understanding and whatever belongs 
to it, consequently everything of faith; and that the female or woman signifies the will, or the things appertaining to the will, consequently whatever has relation to love; wherefore she was called 
Eve, a name signifying life, which is of love alone. By the female therefore is also signified the church, as has been previously shown; and by the male, a man [vir]of the church. The subject here is 
the state of the church when it was spiritual, and which was afterwards made celestial, wherefore "male" is mentioned before "female" as also in chapter 1:26, 27. The expression to "create" also has 
reference to the spiritual man but afterwards when the marriage has been effected, that is, when the church has been made celestial, it is not said "male and female" but "man [homo]" who, by reason of 
their marriage, signifies both; wherefore it presently follows, "and He called their name Man" by which is signified the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 476</b></p><p><b>476.</b>
That 'male and female' means the marriage of faith and love has been stated and shown already. That is to say, 'male' or man (vir) means the understanding and what belongs to the understanding, and so 
what belongs to faith, while 'female' means the will, or what belongs to the will, and so what belongs to love. This also is why she was called Eve, from a word meaning life, which belongs to love alone. 
'Female' therefore also means the Church, as also shown already, and 'male' the man (vir) of the Church. At present the subject is the state of the Church at the time it was spiritual and shortly 
to become celestial, which is why the word 'male' comes first, as it does also in 1:26, <a href="27.htm">27</a>. Furthermore the expression 'to create' has regard to the spiritual man. As soon however as that marriage has 
taken place, that is, the Church has become celestial, it is no longer called 'male and female' but 'Man' (Homo) who by virtue of the marriage means both. Consequently 'and He called their name Man', 
which means the Church, follows next.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 476</b>
</p><b>476.</b>
Quod per 'masculum et feminam' significetur conjugium inter fidem et amorem, prius dictum et ostensum est, nempe quod 'masculus aut vir' significet intellectum et quae sunt intellectus, ita quae sunt 
fidei; et quod 'femina' significet voluntatem seu quae sunt voluntatis, ita quae sunt amoris; quare etiam dicta est Havah, a vita quae solius amoris est: ideo per 'feminam' quoque significatur Ecclesia 
ut prius quoque ostensum, et per 'masculum' vir Ecclesiae.  Agitur hic de statu Ecclesiae cum fuit spiritualis, et quae mox facta est caelestis quare praecedit masculus, similiter ac cap. i 26, 27 
vox 'creare' etiam spectat spiritualem hominem: mox autem cum conjugium factum seu Ecclesia caelestis facta, tunc nec 'masculus et femina,' sed Homo dicitur, qui utrumque ex conjugio significat; quare 
sequitur mox 'et vocavit nomen illorum Homo,' quo significatur Ecclesia. </p>
