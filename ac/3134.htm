<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3134节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3134.</strong>“说，那男人对我如此说”表属世人中的真理的倾向。这同样从这些话所蕴含的情感，以及那人，或亚伯拉罕的仆人对利百加所说的话清楚可知，由此明显可知所表示的是真理的倾向。这也可从“那人”的含义清楚可知，“那男人”是指真理（参看<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节），在此是指属世人里面、出自神性的真理，因为此处那男人是指亚伯拉罕的老仆人，他表示属世人（参看<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>节）。在圣言，尤其圣言的预言部分，“（男）人”（man[vir]）这个词经常出现，如“（男）人（man）和妻子”、“（男）人（man）和女人（woman）”、“（男）人（man[vir]）和人（man [homo]或human being[vir et homo]）”。在这些地方，就内义而言，“（男）人”（man[vir]）表示属于理解力之物，也就是真理；而“妻子”、“女人”、“居民”、“人”（man [homo]或human being[vir et homo]）表示属于意愿之物，也就是良善。如以赛亚书：<br />我观看，并无一人；他们中间也没有谋士。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.28.htm">41:28</a>）<br />“无人”（no man）表没有拥有聪明、因而拥有真理的人。<br />我来，并无一人；我呼唤，无人答应。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.2.htm">50:2</a>）<br />此处的意思也一样。<br /><br />真理在街上仆倒，正直也不得进入；真理被夺走；离恶的人反成疯子。耶和华观看，见祂眼里的恶没有审判，也无人（拯救），甚为诧异。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.14.htm">59:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“无人”（No man）明显表示没有拥有聪明、因而拥有普遍意义上的真理之人。这几节经文论述了教会的末期，这时，真理根本不复存在，故经上说“真理在街上仆倒，正直也不得进入，真理被夺走”。“街”也论及真理（参看<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）；“审判”亦论及真理（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。耶利米书： <br />你们当在耶路撒冷的街上跑来跑去，到宽阔处去看看、认识、寻找，如果你能找到一个人，一个行公平、求真理的人，我就赦免这城。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.1.htm">5:1</a>）<br />此处“一个人”明显表一个拥有聪明、因而拥有真理的人。西番雅书：<br />我使他们的街道荒凉，以致无人经过；他们的城邑毁灭，以致无人，也无居民。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.6.htm">3:6</a>）<br />“无人”表没有真理；“无居民”表没有良善（参看<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节等）。</p>

Saying, Thus spoke the man unto me. That this signifies the inclination of truth in the natural man, is in like manner evident from the affection in these words, and also from what the man, or Abraham's 
servant, spoke to Rebekah; from which it is evident that it is the inclination that is signified; and also from the signification of a "man" as being truth (see n. 265, 749, 1007), here truth in the 
natural man from the Divine-because the man is here Abraham's elder servant, by whom is signified the natural man (as may be seen above, n. 3019). In the Word, especially the prophetic, the word "man" 
[vir] often occurs; as "man and wife," "man and woman," "man and inhabitant," also "man [vir] and man [homo]"; and in such places by "man" [vir] in the internal sense is signified that which is of 
the understanding, which is truth; and by "wife," "woman," "inhabitant," and "man" [homo], that which is of the will, which is good. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I see, and there is no man; even among them, and 
there is no counselor (Isa. 41:28); </p>
<p>"no man" denotes no one intelligent, thus no truth. Again: </p>
<p>     I came, and there was no man; I called, and there was none to answer (Isa. 50:2); </p>
<p>the meaning 
here being the same. [2] Again: </p>
<p>     Truth hath stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot enter; and truth hath been taken away; and he that departeth from evil is mad. And Jehovah saw, and it 
was evil in His eyes that there was no judgment, and no man, and He was amazed (Isa. 59:14-16). "No man" plainly means no one intelligent, and thus in the universal sense no truth. It here treats of 
the last time of the church, when there is no longer any truth; and it is therefore said, "truth hath stumbled in the street, uprightness cannot enter, truth hath been taken away." (That "street" also 
is predicated of truth, may be seen above, n. 2336; and "judgment" also, n. 2235.) In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad 
places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth judgment, that seeketh truth (Jer. 5:1). Here a "man" evidently denotes one who is intelligent; and also truth. In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     I 
will make their streets desolate, that none passeth by; their cities shall be devastated, so that there shall be no man; that there shall be no inhabitant (Zeph. 3:6). "No man" denotes no truth; "no 
inhabitant," no good (see above, n. 2268, 2451, 2712, and many other places). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3134</b></p><p><b>3134.</b>
'Who said, Thus the man spoke to me' means the leanings of truth in the natural man. This likewise is clear from the affection that occurs here, and also from what the man, or Abraham's servant, said 
to Rebekah, from which it is evident that the leanings of truth are meant; and from the meaning of 'the man' as truth, dealt with in <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>, here truth within the natural man and coming from 
the Divine, as he is Abraham's oldest servant, who means the natural man, see <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>. In the prophetical part of the Word especially 'man' (vir) is a word that occurs often - in the expressions 'man and 
wife', 'man and woman', 'man and inhabitant', and also 'man and human being' (vir et homo). In those expressions 'man' in the internal sense means that which belongs to the understanding, which is truth, 
while 'wife', 'woman', 'inhabitant', and 'human being' mean that which belongs to the will, which is good. As in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I look, and there is no man, and from these there is no counsellor. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'No man' stands for no one having intelligence, and so for no truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I came, and there was no man; I called and no one answered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2050:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 50:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning 
is the same. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Truth has stumbled in the street, and uprightness has been unable to come in, and truth has been removed, and he who retreats from evil is insane. Jehovah saw, 
and it was evil in His eyes that there was no judgement. And He saw, and there was no man, and wondered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:14-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:14-16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'No man' clearly stands for no one having intelligence, and so in the universal 
sense for no truth. These verses in Isaiah refer to the final period of the Church when no truth at all exists any longer. Hence the statement 'truth has stumbled in the street, uprightness cannot 
come in, and truth has been removed'. 'The street' too has reference to truth, see <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>, as does 'judgement', <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now, and take 
note, and search in its broad places, if you find a man, if anyone is executing judgement and seeking truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 5:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'a man' clearly stands for one having intelligence, and for truth. 
In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make their streets desolate with none passing through; their cities will be devastated, with not a man and not an inhabitant there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Not a man' stands for no truth, 
'not an inhabitant' for no good, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>. The same occurs in many other places besides these. </p>

`Dicendo, Ita locutus ad me vir': quod significet propensionem veri in naturali homine, constat pariter ex affectione quae hic, tum ex illis quae vir seu servus Abrahami ad Rebeccam locutus, ex quibus 
patet quod sit propensio, et ex significatione `viri' quod sit verum, de qua n. 265, 749, 1007, hic verum in naturali homine a Divino, quia est `servus senior Abrahami' per quem quod naturalis homo 
{1}significetur, videatur n. 3019. In Verbo imprimis prophetico saepius dicitur `vir,' nempe vir et uxor, vir et femina, vir et habitator, tum vir et homo, ac ibi per `virum' in sensu interno significatur 
id quod intellectus est, quod est verum; et per `uxorem, feminam, habitatorem et hominem' id quod voluntatis est, quod est bonum; ut apud Esaiam,           Video, et nullus vir, et de illis et 
nullus consiliator,      xli 28; `nullus vir' pro non intelligente, ita pro non vero: </p>
<p>     (m)apud eundem,           Veni et non vir, clamavi et non respondens, l 2,  pariter(n): [2] apud eundem,  
         Impegit in platea veritas, et rectitudo non {2}potuit      advenire, et fuit veritas sublata, et recedens a malo      {3}insanus: vidit Jehovah, et malum fuit in oculis Ipsius,      quod 
non judicium, et vidit et nullus vir, et obstupuit, lix      14-16; </p>
<p>`nullus vir' manifeste pro non intelligente, ita in sensu universali pro non vero; agitur de tempore ultimo Ecclesiae quando amplius 
nihil veri, quare dicitur, `impegit in platea veritas, rectitudo non potest advenire, fuit veritas sublata'; quod etiam `platea' praedicetur de vero, videatur n. 2336, et quod `judicium,' n. 2235: 
apud Jeremiam,           Discurrite per plateas Hierosolymae, et videte quaeso, et      cognoscite, et quaerite in vicis ejus, si inveniatis virum, si      sit faciens judicium, quaerens veritatem, 
(x)v 1; </p>
<p>etiam manifeste `vir' pro intelligente ac vero: apud Zephaniam,           Desolabo plateas illorum, et non transiens, devastabuntur      urbes (c)illorum, et non vir, et non habitator, iii 
6;  `non vir' pro non vero,`non habitator' pro non bono n. 2268, 2451, 2712; praeter multis aliis in locis. @1 significatus$  @2 potest$  @3 so Sch but Heb.        (mishtolel) might also mean praeda factus, 
(i.e. e medio raptus non invenitur).  S thus renders it in Ps. lxxvi 6.$  </p>
