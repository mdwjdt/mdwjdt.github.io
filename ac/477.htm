<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>477.</strong>“人”是上古教会，这一点在前面频繁提及并说明；在至高意义上，唯独主自己是人。由此而来的属天教会作为祂的“样式”，被称为“人”；由此而来的属灵教会也如此称谓，因为它是主的“形像”。但一般意义来说，凡拥有人类觉知（human understanding）者皆被称作“人”，因为人（person）凭觉知而为人（man），一个人也凭此比另一人更是“人”（man）。不过人与人之间应当照着基于爱主之信来加以分别。<br />②上古教会，每个真教会，以及属教会的信众，也就是凭对主之爱和对主之信行事者，尤其被称为“人”。这一点从圣言清楚看出，如以西结书：<br />我必使以色列全家的人数在你上面增多。我必使人和牲畜在你上面加增；他们必繁殖增多；我必使你们有人居住，像你们古时那样，并要使你们比先前更蒙福。我必使人，就是我的民以色列，在你上面行走。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.10.htm">36:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处用“古时”表示上古教会，“先前”表示古教会；“以色列家”和“以色列民”表示初期教会或外邦人教会；所有这些教会都被称为“人”。<br />③在摩西五经：<br />你当追想上古之日，思念历代之年；至高者将地业赐给列邦，将人的众子分开时，就照着以色列众子的数目立定了百姓的疆界。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.7.htm">32:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处的“上古之日”表示上古教会；“历代之年”表示古教会；“人的众子”指那些信主者，这信是“以色列众子的数目”。以耶利米书中，重生之人被称为“人”：<br />我观看地，不料，地是空虚混沌；我观看天，天也无光。我观看，不料，无人；空中的飞鸟也逃掉了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.23.htm">4:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.25.htm">25</a>）<br />此处的“地”代表外在人，“天”代表内在人；“人”（ man）代表对良善之爱；“空中的飞鸟”代表对真理的觉知。<br />④又如：<br />看哪！日子快到，我要把人的种和牲畜的种播种在以色列家和犹大家。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.27.htm">31:27</a>）<br />此处的“人”代表内在人，“牲畜”代表外在人。又如：<br />你们休要倚靠鼻孔是气的人，他算什么呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.22.htm">2:22</a>）<br />这里“人”代表教会成员：<br />耶和华要将人迁到远方，在这地中将有许多被遗弃的地方。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.12.htm">6:12</a>）<br />这里论及人的荒废（vastation），以至于不再有善与真。又如：<br />地上的居民被焚烧，剩下的人稀少。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.6.htm">24:6</a>）<br />此处的“人”代表那些有信者。同一先知书：<br />大路荒凉，行者止息，他背了约，藐视城邑，不顾人（enowsh），地悲哀衰残。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.8.htm">33:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这里所说之人就是希伯来语的“以挪士”（Enosh）。又如：<br />我必使人（enowsh）比精金还少，使人（adam）比俄斐纯金更少；因此我要使天震动，地必摇撼，离其本位。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.12.htm">13:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处首先提及的人是“以挪士“（Enosh），其次是“亚当”（Adam）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]477.</strong> The identification of the human being with the earliest church has been stated and demonstrated many times before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_277" target=_top>277</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_288" target=_top>288</a>]. In the highest sense, the Lord himself is the only human being [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49" target=_top>49</a>]. The heavenly type of church acquires its name as human from this, because it is a likeness of the Lord [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_50" target=_top>50-51</a>]. The spiritual type of church does too, because it is an image of him. But in common usage, a human being is defined as anyone who has a human intellect, [on the supposition that] the intellect makes us human, and [that] having more of it makes one person more human than another; although distinctions among us would [better] be based on the degree of our loving belief in the Lord.<br />[2] What is mainly called the human is the earliest church and every true religion, and consequently the people in such a religion, or people characterized by love for and faith in the Lord. The Word makes this clear, as in Ezekiel:<br />I will multiply humankind — the whole, entire house of Israel — upon you, [mountains of Israel]. I will multiply human and animal upon you so that they may multiply and reproduce. And I will cause you to live as in your ancient times, and I will do good to you beyond that at your beginnings. And I will cause humankind — my people Israel — to walk upon you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_10-11" target=_top>Ezekiel 36:10-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_12" target=_top>12</a>)<br />The ancient times here symbolize the earliest church, the beginnings symbolize the ancient churches, and the house of Israel and the people Israel symbolize the early [Christian] church, or the church among non-Jews. All these churches are being referred to as human beings.<br />[3] In Moses:<br />Remember the days of old, understand the years of generation after generation, when the Highest One gave an inheritance to the nations; when he divided the children of humankind, he set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_7-8" target=_top>Deuteronomy 32:7-8</a>)<br />The days of old mean the earliest church, while "generation after generation" means the ancient churches. The ones being called children of humankind are those who believed in the Lord; their belief is "the number of the children of Israel." A regenerate individual is called a human being in Jeremiah:<br />I looked at the earth and there — void and emptiness; and to the heavens, and these had no light! I looked, and there — not a human! And every bird of the heavens had flown away. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_4_23" target=_top>Jeremiah 4:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_4_25" target=_top>25</a>)<br />The earth stands for the outer self and heaven for the inner, the human stands for love of goodness, and the bird of the heavens stands for comprehension of truth.<br />[4] In the same author:<br />Look! The days are coming when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of human and the seed of animal. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_27" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:27</a>)<br />The human stands for the inner self and the animal for the outer. In Isaiah:<br />Keep your distance from humans, whose breath is in their nose, for how much are they worth? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_2_22" target=_top>Isaiah 2:22</a>)<br />The person stands for someone in the church. In the same author:<br />Jehovah will send humankind far away, but a great [portion] will be left in the middle of the land. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_12" target=_top>Isaiah 6:12</a>)<br />This is about the devastation of a person to the point where no good or truth remains. In the same author:<br />The residents of the land will be destroyed by fire, and the humanity left behind will be a pittance. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_6" target=_top>Isaiah 24:6</a>)<br />Humanity here stands for those who possess faith. In the same author:<br />The paths have been abandoned; the traveler on the path has ceased. They have nullified the compact; they have despised the cities; they have thought nothing of humankind. The land mourns and droops. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_33_8-9" target=_top>Isaiah 33:8-9</a>)<br />This time "humankind" actually refers to humankind, or a human being, which in the Hebrew [here] is enosh.{*1} In the same author:<br />I will make humankind more precious than pure gold, and humanity [more precious] than Ophir's gold. Therefore I will shake heaven, and the earth will quake out of its place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_13_12-13" target=_top>Isaiah 13:12-13</a>)<br />Here humankind [in the Hebrew] is called enosh the first time, adam the second time.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the word enosh, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_336" target=_top>336</a>.

That "Man" is the Most Ancient Church has been often said and shown above; for in the supreme sense the Lord Himself alone is Man. From this the celestial church is called Man, as being a likeness, and 
from this the spiritual church is afterwards so called because it was an image. But in a general sense everyone is called a man who has human understanding; for man is man by virtue of understanding, 
and according thereto one person is more a man than another, although the distinction of one man from another ought to be made according to his faith as grounded in love to the Lord.  [2] That the 
Most Ancient Church, and every true church, and hence those who are of the church, or who live from love to the Lord and from faith in Him, are especially called "man" is evident from the Word, as in 
Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will cause man to multiply upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; I will cause to multiply upon you man and beast, that they may be multiplied and bear fruit; and I will cause 
you to dwell according to your antiquities and I will do better unto you than at your beginnings and I will cause man to walk upon you, My people Israel (Ezek. 36:10, 11, 12),  where by "antiquities" 
is signified the Most Ancient Church; by "beginnings" the Ancient Churches; by the "house of Israel" and "people Israel" the primitive church, or Church of the Gentiles; all which churches are called 
"man."  [3] So in Moses: </p>
<p>     Remember the days of eternity, understand ye the years of generation and generation; when the Most High would give the nations an inheritance, when He would set apart 
the sons of man, He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel (Deut. 32:7, 8),  where by the "days of eternity" is meant the Most Ancient Church; by "generation and 
generation" the Ancient Churches; the "sons of man" are those who were in faith toward the Lord, which faith is the "number of the sons of Israel." That a regenerate person is called "man" appears from 
Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I beheld the earth, and lo it was empty and void; and the heavens, and they had no light; I beheld, and lo, no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled (Jer. 4:23, 25),  where 
"earth" signifies the external man; "heaven' the internal; "man" the love of good; the "birds of the heavens" the understanding of truth.  [4] Again: </p>
<p>     Behold the days come that I will sow the 
house of Israel, and the house of Judah, with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast (31:27), where "man" signifies the internal man, "beast" the external. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Cease ye from man in 
whose nostrils is breath, for wherein is he to be accounted of (Isa. 2:22), where by "man" is signified a man of the church. Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall remove man far away, and many things shall be 
left in the midst of the land (Isa. 6:12), speaking of the vastation of man, in that there should no longer exist either good or truth. Again: </p>
<p>     The inhabitants of the earth shall be burned, and 
man shall be left very little (Isa. 24:6), where "man" signifies those who have faith. Again: </p>
<p>     The paths have been desolated, the farer on the path hath ceased, he hath made vain the covenant, he 
hath despised the cities, he hath not regarded man, the earth mourneth and languisheth (Isa. 33:8-9), denoting the man who in the Hebrew tongue is "Enosh." Again: </p>
<p>     I will make a man more precious 
than fine gold, and a man than the gold of Ophir; therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall be moved out of her place (Isa. 13:12-13),where the word for man in the first place is "Enosh" 
and in the second is "Adam." </p>

'Man' is the Most Ancient Church. This has been stated and shown quite often already, for in the highest sense the Lord Himself alone is Man. From this the celestial Church, being the likeness of Him, 
is referred to as 'Man', and then from this the spiritual Church is so called because it was an image of Him. But in a general sense everyone is called man who has human understanding, for a person 
is man, one person more so than the next, by virtue of his understanding. Nevertheless one person ought to be distinguished from the next according to faith inherent in love to the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Most 
Ancient Church, and every true Church, and so people who belong to the Church, that is, who do so by virtue of love to the Lord and of faith in Him, are pre-eminently called 'Man'. This is clear from 
the Word, as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause, man to multiply upon you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. I will cause man and beast to multiply upon you so that they multiply and are fruitful, and 
I will resettle you<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to be as in your ancient times, and I will do more good than in your early days. I will cause man to walk upon you, even My people Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2036:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 36:10-12</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here the Most Ancient 
Church is meant by 'earliest times', the Ancient Churches by 'early days', and the Primitive Church, or Church among gentiles, by 'the house of Israel' and 'the people of Israel', all of which Churches 
are called Man.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Remember the days of old, understand the years of generation after generation. When the Most High gave to the nations an inheritance, when He separated the 
sons of man, He fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Most Ancient Church is meant by 'the days of old' and the Ancient Churches 
by 'generation after generation'. Those people are called 'sons of man' whose faith was in the Lord, which faith is 'the number of the sons of Israel'. A regenerate person is called 'man' in Jeremiah, 
 </p>
<p>I looked to the earth, and behold, a void and an emptiness, and at the heavens, and they had no light. I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the air' had flown away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:23,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:23, 25</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'earth' stands for the external man, 'heaven' for the internal man; 'man' stands for a love of good, and 'the birds of the air'<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> for an understanding of truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are coming when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:27</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here 'man' stands for the internal man, 'beast' 
for the external man. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Turn yourselves away from the man in whose nostrils there is breath,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> for of what account is he? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%202:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 2:22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Man' stands for the member of the Church. 
In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will remove man far away, and there will be many forsaken places in the midst of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the vastation of man, so that good and truth are 
no more. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The inhabitants of the land will be scorched and few men (homo) left. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'men' (homo) stands for people who have faith. In the same prophet,  The 
highways have been laid waste, the wayfarer has ceased. He has made the covenant worthless, despised cities, had no regard for man; the land mourns and languishes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2033:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 33:8, 9</a>.  </p>
<p>This stands for the 
man who in Hebrew is Enosh. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will make a man (homo) more precious than pure gold, and a man (homo) than the gold of Ophir. Therefore I will jolt heaven, and the earth will 
be shaken out of its place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:12, 13</a>.

<p>The first reference to 'a man' here is Enosh, but the second is Adam.
