<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4998.</strong>创世记39:10-15.这事以后，她天天和约瑟说，约瑟却不听从她，不与她同寝，也不和她在一处。于是有一天，约瑟进屋里去办事，家中的男丁没有一个人在那屋里。妇人就拉住他的衣裳说，你与我同寝吧！约瑟把衣裳丢在妇人手里，逃出来到外边去了。于是妇人看见约瑟把衣裳丢在她手里逃出去了，就叫了家里的人来，向他们讲述说，你们看！他给我们带来一个希伯来人戏弄我们。他到我这里来，要与我同寝，我就大声喊叫；于是他听见我抬高声音喊叫，就把衣裳丢在我这里，逃出来到外边去了。<br />“这事以后”表第四个状态。“她天天和约瑟说”表对这事的思考。“约瑟却不听从她，不与她同寝”表它对这种结合充满憎恶。“也不和她在一处”表唯恐它由此与它成为一体。“于是有一天”表第五个状态。“约瑟进屋里去办事”表当致力于与属世层里面的属灵良善结合的工作时。“家中的男丁没有一个人在那屋里”表没有任何人的帮助。“妇人就拉住他的衣裳”表非属灵的真理将自己依附于属灵真理的最外层。“说，你与我同寝吧”表以达到结合的目的。“约瑟把衣裳丢在妇人手里”表这最外层的真理被移除。“逃出来到外边去了”表既然如此，它就没有那用来保护自己的真理了。“于是妇人看见”表对这事的觉知。“约瑟把衣裳丢在她手里逃出去了”表这最外层真理的分离。“就叫了家里的人来”表虚假。“向他们讲述说”表迫切需要。“你们看！他给我们带来一个希伯来人”表一个仆人或某种卑贱之物。“戏弄我们”表它起来。“他到我这里来，要与我同寝”表那真理想要与它结合。“我就大声喊叫”表它充满憎恶。“于是他听见”表当它被发觉的时候。“我抬高声音喊叫”表有一种极大的厌恶。“就把衣裳丢在我这里”表有证据证明它曾靠近过。“逃出来到外边去了”表但它还是将自己分离出去了。</p>

Verses 10-15. And it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, to be with her. And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into the house to 
do his work; and no man of the men of the house was there in the house. And she caught hold of him in his garment, saying, Lie with me; and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
And it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, that she cried unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought thus a Hebrew 
man to mock us; he came to me to lie with me, and I cried with a great voice; and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got 
him out. "And it came to pass," signifies a fourth state; "as she spake to Joseph day by day," signifies thought concerning this matter; "that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her," signifies that 
it was averse to being conjoined; "to be with her," signifies lest in this way it should be united; "and it came to pass on a certain day," signifies a fifth state; "that he went into the house to do 
his work," signifies when it was in the work of conjunction with spiritual good in the natural; "and no man of the men of the house was there in the house," signifies that it was without the aid of 
anyone; "and she caught hold of him in his garment," signifies that truth not spiritual applied itself to the ultimate of spiritual truth; "saying, Lie with me," signifies for the purpose of conjunction; 
"and he left his garment in her hand," signifies that it took away this ultimate truth; "and fled, and got him out," signifies that thus it had no truth by which to defend itself; "and it came to 
pass when she saw," signifies perception concerning this matter; "that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth," signifies concerning the separation of ultimate truth; "that she cried 
unto the men of her house," signifies falsities; "and spake unto them, saying," signifies exhortation; "See, he hath brought us a Hebrew man," signifies a servant; "to mock us," signifies that it rose 
up; "he came to me to lie with me," signifies that it desired to conjoin itself; "and I cried with a great voice," signifies aversion; "and it came to pass when he heard," signifies when it was perceived; 
"that I lifted up my voice and cried," signifies that there was great aversion; "that he left his garment by me," signifies a witness that it made an approach; "and fled and got him out," signifies 
that nevertheless it separated itself. </p>

Verses 10-15 And it happened as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not listen to her, to lie with her, to be with her. And it happened on a certain day, that he went to the house to do his 
work, and none of the men<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the house was there in the house. And she took hold of him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went out of doors. And 
it happened as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of doors, that she cried out to the men of her house, and said to them - she said, See, he has brought us a Hebrew man 
to make sport of us. He came to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. And it happened as he was hearing [me], that I lifted up my voice and cried out, and he left his garment with me, 
and fled, and went out of doors.  </p>
<p>'And it happened' means a fourth state. 'As she spoke to Joseph day after day' means thought regarding that matter. 'That he did not listen to her, to lie with her' 
means that it was filled with aversion to such a joining together. 'To be with her' means lest it should thereby be made one with it. 'And it happened on a certain day' means a fifth state. 'That he 
went to the house to do his work' means when engaged in the work of being joined to spiritual good within the natural. 'And none of the men of the house was there in the house' means without the help 
of any other. 'And she laid hold of him by his garment' means that unspiritual truth attached itself to the outermost existence of spiritual truth. 'Saying, Lie with me' means to the end that a joining 
together might be effected. 'And he left his garment in her hand' means that this outermost truth was removed. 'And fled, and went out of doors' means that this being so it did not have that truth 
with which to protect itself. 'And it happened as she saw' means a perception regarding this matter. 'That he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of doors' means regarding the separation 
of that outermost truth. 'That she cried out to the men of the house' means falsities. 'And said to them - she said' means an urgent demand. 'See, he has brought us a Hebrew man means something servile. 
'To make sport of us' means that this rose up. 'He came to me to lie with me' means that that truth wanted to be joined to it. 'And I cried out with a loud voice' means that it was filled with aversion. 
'And it happened as he was hearing [me]' means when it was discerned. 'That I lifted up my voice and cried out' means that there was a great aversion. 'And he left his garment with me' means evidence 
that an approach had been made. 'And fled, and went out of doors' means that it nevertheless separated itself.

Vers.  10-15.  Et factum, ut loqui illam ad Josephum die die, et non audivit ad illam, ad cubandum apud illam, ad esse cum illa.  Et factum ut die quodam, et venit domum ad faciendum opus suum, et 
nullus vir e viris domus ibi in domo.  Et prehendit eum in veste ejus, dicendo, Cuba mecum; et reliquit vestem suam in manu illius, et fugit, et exivit foras.  Et factum, ut videre illam, quod reliquit 
vestem suam in manu sua, et fugit foras.  Et clamavit ad viros domus suae et dixit illis, dicendo, Videte, adduxit nobis virum Hebraeum ad illudendum nobis, venit ad me ad cubandum mecum, et 
clamavi voce magna.  Et factum, ut audire eum, quod sustuli vocem meam, et clamavi, et reliquit vestem suam apud me, et fugit, et exivit foras.  `Et factum' significat quartum statum: `ut loqui illam 
ad Josephum die die' significat cogitationem de illa re: `et non audivit ad illam ad cubandum apud illam significat quod aversaretur conjungi: `ad esse cum illa' significat ne sic adunaretur: `et 
factum ut die quodam' significat quintum statum: </p>
<p>`et venit domum ad faciendum opus suum' significat cum in opere conjunctionis esset cum bono spirituali in naturali: `et nullus vir e viris domus 
ibi in domo' significat quod absque ullius auxilio {1}: `et prehendit eum in veste ejus' significat quod verum non spirituale applicaret se ad ultimum veri spiritualis: `dicendo, Cuba mecum' significat 
conjunctionis causa: `et reliquit vestem suam in manu illius' significat quod abstraheret ultimum id verum: </p>
<p>`et fugit et exivit foras' significat quod sic non ei verum per quod se defenderet: 
`et factum ut videre illam' significat perceptionem de illa re: `quod reliquit vestem suam in manu sua, et fugit foras' significat de separatione veri ultimi: `et clamavit ad viros domus' significat 
falsa: `et dixi illis, dicendo' significat exhortationem: `Videte, adduxit nobis virum Hebraeum' significat servum: `ad illudendum nobis' significat quo' insurgeret: `venit ad me ad cubandum mecum' 
significat quod illud vellet se conjungere:  `et clamavi voce magna' significat quo aversaretur: `et factum ut audire eum' significat cum apperceptum: `quod sustuli vocem meam et clamavi' significat 
quod magna aversatio `et reliquit vestem suam apud me' significat testem quod accesserit: fugit et exivit foras' significat quod usque se separaverit. @1 A ip Esai. lxiii$ </p>
