<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1821节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1821.</strong>创世记15:9. 耶和华对他说，你为我取一头三岁的母牛犊，一只三岁的母山羊，一只三岁的公绵羊，一只斑鸠和一只雏鸽。<br />“耶和华对他说”表直觉。“取一头三岁的母牛犊，一只三岁的母山羊，一只三岁的公绵羊”表教会的属天事物的代表物：“母牛犊”表外在属天事物的代表物，“母山羊”表内在属天事物的代表物，“公绵羊”表属灵-属天事物的代表物；它们要“取三岁的”，是因为就时期和状态而言，它们要象征教会的一切事物。“一只斑鸠和一只雏鸽”表教会的属灵事物的代表物：“斑鸠”表那些代表外在属灵事物之物，“雏鸽”表那些代表内在属灵事物之物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1821.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1821/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_9" target=_top>Genesis 15:9</a>. And [Jehovah] said to him, "Take yourself a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old she-goat, and a three-year-old ram, and a turtledove, and a chick."<br /> [Jehovah] said to him symbolizes perception. Take a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old she-goat, and a three-year-old ram, means items that serve to represent the heavenly aspects of religion — a heifer, the more superficial ones; a she-goat, the deeper ones; and a ram, the heavenly-spiritual aspects. They were to be three years old because they would cover all eras and conditions of religion. And a turtledove and a chick mean items that serve to represent the spiritual aspects of religion, a turtledove being the more superficial aspects, and a chick, the deeper ones. </p>

Verse 9. And He said unto him, Take thee a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. "He said unto him," signifies perception; 
"take a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years," signifies the representatives of the celestial things of the church; a "heifer" being representative of exterior 
celestial things, a "she-goat" of interior celestial things, and a "ram" of spiritual celestial things; they were to be "three years" old, because they were to involve all things of the church as 
to times and states; "and a turtledove and a young pigeon," signifies the representatives of the spiritual things of the church; a "turtledove" those which are exterior, and a "young pigeon" those which 
are interior.  </p>

<p>'He said to him' means perception. 'Take a 
three year old heifer, and a three year old she-goat, and a three year old ram' means things that are the representatives of the celestial things of the Church, 'a heifer' being those that are the representatives 
of exterior celestial things, 'a she-goat' of interior celestial, 'a ram' of spiritual-celestial; and they had to be 'three years old' because they were to embody all things of the Church 
as to periods and states. 'And a turtle dove and a fledgling' means things that are the representatives of the spiritual things of the Church, 'turtle dove' being those that are exterior, 'fledgling' 
those that are interior.

Vers. 9.  Et dixit ad illum, Accipe tibi vitulam triennem, et capram triennem, et arietem triennem, et turturem, et pullum. 'Dixit ad illum' significat perceptionem: 'accipe vitulam triennem, et capram 
triennem, et arietem triennem' significat illa quae repraesentativa sunt caelestium Ecclesiae, 'vitula' caelestium exteriorum, 'capra' caelestium interiorum, 'aries' caelestium spiritualium; quod 
'triennis,' erat quia involverent omnia Ecclesiae quoad tempora et status: 'et turturem et pullum' significat illa quae repraesentativa sunt spiritualium Ecclesiae, 'turtur' quae exteriora, 'pullus' quae 
interiora. </p>
