<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">地 狱（续）——贪婪者的地狱，那里污秽的耶路撒冷和荒漠中的强盗；一心追求享乐者的全然恶臭的地狱</h4><br /><strong>938.</strong>贪婪的人是最龌龊的，对于死后的生活、灵魂和内在人，他们比谁都思想的少。他们甚至不知道天堂是什么，因为其思维水平比其他任何人都要低，他们将思维完全投入并浸没于肉体和世俗之物中。因此，当进入来生后，他们很长时间没有意识到自己成为精灵的事实，反而以为仍完全在肉体中。出于贪婪、构成其思维的观念可以说变得肉体和世俗化，并转化为可怖的幻觉。令人难以置信的是，在来生，龌龊的贪婪者看似在地窖中忙忙碌碌，这里有他们的金钱，他们在此遭受老鼠的骚扰。然而，无论如何骚扰他们，他们就是不肯离开，直到他们筋疲力尽，最后走出这些墓穴。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]938.</strong> The Hells (Continued): Misers' Hells, the Foul Jerusalem and Outlaws in the Wilderness, and the Feces-Laden Hells of Those Who Have Pursued Sensual Pleasure Alone<br />OF all people, misers are the vilest and think the least about life after death, the soul, and the inner being. They do not even know what heaven is. This is because of all people they do the least to elevate their thinking, which they completely saturate and drench with bodily and earthly preoccupations. The result is that when they enter the other world, for a long time they fail to realize that they are spirits, remaining firmly convinced instead that they are still in the body.<br />Their thoughts, dragged down to the bodily and earthly level by their greed, turn into dreadful hallucinations. Strange to say, but true, in the next life the grossly avaricious seem to themselves to live in cellars where their money is stored and where they are overrun with rats. Despite the rats, they do not leave until they grow unbearably tired of the situation, at which point they finally emerge from these tombs of theirs. </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HELLS. HERE, CONCERNING THE HELLS OF THE AVARICIOUS, THE FILTHY JERUSALEM, AND THE ROBBERS IN A DESERT. ALSO CONCERNING THE EXCREMENTITIOUS HELLS OF THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED 
IN MERE PLEASURES. The avaricious are of all men the most sordid, and think the least about the life after death, the soul, and the internal man. They do not even know what heaven is, because of all 
men they least elevate their thoughts, but sink them and immerse them wholly in corporeal and earthly things. Wherefore when they come into the other life they do not know for a long time that they are 
spirits, but suppose that they are still altogether in the body. The ideas of their thought which from their avarice have become as it were corporeal and earthly, are turned into direful phantasies. 
It seems incredible, yet is true, that in the other life the sordidly avaricious seem to themselves to be busy in cellars where their money is, and to be infested there by mice; yet however they may 
be infested they do not withdraw until they are wearied out, and so at last they work their way out of these tombs. </p>

THE HELLS - continued Here, the hells of the avaricious; then the filthy Jerusalem and the robbers in the desert. Also the utterly foul hells of people who have lived wholly engrossed in the pursuit 
of pleasures. </p>
<p>Avaricious people are the most disgusting of all, giving less thought than anybody else does to the life after death, to the soul, and to the internal man. They do not even know what 
heaven is, for the level of their thought is lower than everybody else's. Their thoughts they plunge and immerse completely in bodily and earthly interests. Consequently when they enter the next life 
they are for a long time unaware of the fact that they are spirits, but imagine that they are still entirely in the physical body. The ideas comprising their thought, which from their avarice have become 
so to speak bodily and earthly, are converted into direful delusions. And what is unbelievable but nevertheless true, the disgustingly avaricious in the next life seem to themselves to be working 
away in cells where their money is, and where they are infested by mice. But no matter how they may be infested they do not leave until they are tired out, and so at last roll out of those tombs. </p>

Continuatio de Infernis Hic de Infernis Avarorum; et de spurca Hierosolyma, et Latronibus in deserto: tum de Infernis excrementitiis eorum, qui in meris                      Voluptatibus 
vixerunt </p>
<p>Avari omnium sordidissimi sunt, et omnium minime de vita post mortem, de anima et de interno homine cogitant; ne quidem sciunt quid caelum, quia omnium minime elevant suas cogitationes, 
sed eas prorsus infundunt et immergunt corporeis et terrestribus; quare cum in alteram vitam veniunt, diu non sciunt quod spiritus sint, sed putant se prorsus esse adhuc in corpore: ideae eorum 
cogitationis, quae ab avaritia factae quasi corporeae et terrestres, vertuntur in diras phantasias; et quod incredibile usque verum, sordide avari in altera vita videntur sibi in cellis versari, ubi 
eorum pecuniae, et ibi infestari a muribus; sed utcumque infestantur, non inde recedunt usque dum defatigantur, sic tandem se evolvunt iis sepulcris. </p>
