<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">代表与对应（续）</h4><br />3213.在灵人界，不计其数的代表物会显现出来，并且几乎不间断。它们都是属灵和属天之物的可见形式，不同于世上所出现的形式。我通过与灵人并天使的日常交往而得知它们的来源。它们是从天堂，以及那里天使的观念和言谈流入的。因为天使的观念，以及由这些观念所产生的言谈降至灵人那里时，会以种种方式有代表性地呈现出来。诚实善良的灵人通过这些代表就能知道天使们彼此在谈论什么。因为这些代表物内含出自天使的某种事物，由于这类事物激发了这些灵人的情感，故甚至连它的本质也被感知到。天使的观念和言谈无法以其它方式展现在灵人面前，因为与灵人的观念相比，天使的观念所包含的事物是无穷无尽的。除非它以代表性的方式，因而以可视图像被赋予可见形式，并显明自身，否则，灵人几乎不明白它所含之物中的任何事物，因为这类事物绝大部分是难以言表的。但当这些观念通过可见形式呈现出来时，就较为一般的事物而言，它们对灵人来说就变得可理解了。说来奇妙，所表现出的事物哪怕最小的细节也无不在表达存在于流出这些代表物的天使社群观念中的某种属灵和属天之物。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING REPRESENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDENCES.  In the world of spirits there come forth innumerable and almost continual representatives, which are forms of actual things spiritual and 
celestial, not unlike those which are in the world. Whence these come it has been granted to me to know by daily interaction with spirits and angels. They inflow from heaven, and from the ideas and 
speech of the angels there; for the ideas of angels and their derivative speech, when they come down to spirits, are exhibited representatively in various ways. From these representations upright and 
well-disposed spirits are enabled to know what the angels are saying among themselves, for inwardly within the representatives there is something angelic, which, in consequence of its power to excite 
affection, is perceived even as to its quality. Angelic ideas and speech cannot be exhibited before spirits in any other way; for as compared with the idea of a spirit an angelic idea contains things 
illimitable; and unless it were formed and exhibited representatively, and thus visibly by images, a spirit would scarcely understand anything of its contents, which are for the most part unutterable. 
But when the ideas are represented by forms, then insofar as the more general things are concerned they become comprehensible to spirits. And wonderful to say there is not even the smallest thing in 
that which is represented which does not express something spiritual and celestial that is in the idea of the angelic society from which the representative flows down. </p>

REPRESENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDENCES - continued </p>
<p>In the world of spirits countless representatives manifest themselves almost constantly. They are visible forms of spiritual and celestial things, not 
unlike the forms that occur in the world. The origin of them I have been given to know through daily association with spirits and angels. Representatives in the world of spirits flow in from heaven, 
and from the ideas and the discussions of the angels there. Indeed when angels' ideas and their discussions resulting from those ideas come down to spirits, they present themselves in a variety of ways 
as representatives. Upright spirits are able to know from those representatives what angels are discussing with one another, for inwardly representatives have within them that which comes from angels, 
and since this stirs the affections of those spirits, it is perceived even as to the essential nature of it. Angels' ideas and discussions cannot present themselves to spirits in any other way, for 
an idea existing with an angel contains immeasurably more than an idea existing with a spirit, and unless it were given visible form and presented itself in a representative way, and so visually by 
means of images, a spirit would understand hardly anything whatever of those things. For such things are for the most part inconceivable. But when they are represented by means of visible forms they 
are rendered such that spirits are able to comprehend some fairly general aspects. This is a marvel, for not even the smallest detail of the things that are represented fails to express something spiritual 
or celestial present in an idea existing with the angelic community from which the representative flows down. </p>

Continuatio de Repraesentationibus et Correspondentiis </p>
<p>In mundo spirituum innumerabilia et paene continua existunt repraesentativa, quae sunt rerum spiritualium et caelestium formae, non absimiles 
illis quae in mundo: unde illa, ex diuturno cum spiritibus et {1}angelis commercio scire datum; influunt e caelo, et ex angelorum ibi ideis et loquelis; angelorum enim ideae ac inde loquelae, cum delabuntur 
ad spiritus, sistuntur repraesentative diversimode; spiritus probi ex illis scire possunt quid angeli inter se loquuntur, nam intus in repraesentativis est angelicum, quod quia afficiens est, 
percipitur, etiam quoad quale. Angelicae ideae et loquelae non aliter possunt sisti coram spiritibus, nam idea angelica indefinita continet prae idea spiritus, quae nisi formaretur ac sisteretur repraesentative, 
et sic visualiter per imagines, spiritus (t)illa vix quicquam intelligeret, nam pleraque sunt ineffabilia; at cum repraesentantur per formas, tunc fiunt {2}spiritibus comprehensibilia quoad 
communiora; et quod mirabile, in illis quae repraesentantur, ne quidem minimum est quod non exprimit aliquid spirituale et caeleste quod est in idea angelicae societatis, e qua repraesentativum defluit. @1
