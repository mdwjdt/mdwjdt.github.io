<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8304节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8304.</strong>“施行奇事”表祂是一切方法的源头，能力通过这些方法而来。这从“奇事”或神迹的含义清楚可知，“奇事”或神迹是指神性能力所用的方法（参看<a href="6910.htm">6910</a>节）。“奇事”之所以表示神性能力所用的方法，是因为人们通过它们被引导相信耶和华是众神中至高无上者；事实上，除祂之外再无别神，因此，要唯独敬拜祂。那些领受这个真理的人后来被引入与对祂的敬拜有关的真理，这些真理就是能力的方法。因为就灵义而言，一切能力都居于来自神性的真理中（参看<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="6423.htm">6423</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="8200.htm">8200</a>节）。就灵义而言，能力就是击败地狱团伙，把他们从自己身边赶走，这一点只能通过真理才能实现。这就是为何“施行奇事”表示主是一切方法的源头，能力通过这些方法而来。在诗篇，神性能力所用的方法也以“奇事”来表示：<br />你们要向耶和华歌唱，歌颂祂，默想祂一切的奇事，要以祂的圣名夸耀，要寻求耶和华与祂的能力，时常寻求祂的面。你们要记念祂的奇事和奇妙的作为，并祂口中的判语。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.2.htm">105:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.5.htm">5</a>）<br />一切能力皆通过从主所领受的信之真理而拥有，这一点从主对彼得的话明显看出来：<br />我还对你说，你是彼得，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上，阴间的门，不能胜过它。我要把天国的钥匙给你。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">16:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处“彼得”代表信；“磐石”在圣言中表示信；“钥匙”表示能力（参看创世记22章序言，以及<a href="4738.htm">4738</a>e，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>e节）。</p>

Doing what is wonderful. That this signifies that from Him are all the means by which is power, is evident from the signification of "wonders" and "miracles," as being means of Divine power (see n. 6910). 
That "wonders" denote means of Divine power, is because by them men were brought to believe that Jehovah was the supreme of the gods, nay, that there was no God besides Him, consequently that He 
alone was to be worshiped; and they who were in this truth were afterward introduced into the truths of the worship of Him, which truths are means of power; for in the spiritual sense all power is in 
truths from the Divine (see n. 3091, 6344, 6423, 6948, 8200). Power in the spiritual sense is to put to flight and cast out from oneself the infernal crew, which is effected solely by means of truths. 
From this then it is that by "doing what is wonderful" is signified that from the Lord are all the means through which is power. The means of Divine power are also signified by "wonders" in David: </p>
<p> 
    Sing ye to Jehovah, sing psalms to Him, meditate ye in all His wonders, glory ye in the name of His holiness, seek ye Jehovah, and His strength, seek ye His faces continually, make mention of His 
wonders, His prodigies, and the judgments of His mouth (Ps. 105:2-5). That all power is in the truths which are of faith from the Lord, is clear from the Lord's words to Peter: </p>
<p>     I say to thee, 
Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:18, 19); </p>
<p>where by 
Peter is represented faith; and by "rock" in the Word is signified faith; and by "key" is meant power (see the preface to Gen. 22, and also n. 4738e, 6344e). </p>

'Doing wonders?' means that He is the Source of all the means through which comes power. This is clear from the meaning of 'wonders', or miracles, as the means used by Divine power, dealt with in <a href="6910.htm">6910</a>. 
The reason why 'wonders' are the means used by Divine power is that by them the people were led to believe that Jehovah was the highest of Gods, indeed that there was no God besides Him, and therefore 
that He alone was to be worshipped. And those who received this truth were afterwards introduced to truths concerned with the worship of Him, which are the means of power. For all power in the spiritual 
sense resides in truths which come from the Divine, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="6423.htm">6423</a>, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="8200.htm">8200</a>. Power in the spiritual sense consists in putting to flight and casting away from oneself the hellish crew, which 
is done solely by means of truths. This then is why 'doing wonders' means that the Lord is the Source of all the means through which comes power. The means used by Divine power are meant by 'wonders' 
also in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Sing to Jehovah, make melody to Him; meditate on all His wonders. Glory in His holy name. Seek Jehovah and His strength; seek His face continually Remember His wonders, His marvels, 
and the judgements of His mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:1-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:1-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The possession of all power by the truths of faith received from the Lord is evident from the Lord's words to Peter, </p>
<blockquote>
I tell you, You are Peter, and 
on this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:18, 19</a>.

<p>'Peter' here represents faith, 'rock' 
in the Word is a sign of faith, and 'key' is used to mean power, see Preface to Genesis <a href="22.htm">22</a>, and also <a href="4738.htm">4738</a> (end), <a href="6344.htm">6344</a> (end). </p>

`Faciens mirabile?': quod significet quod ab Ipso omnia media per quae potentia, constat ex significatione `mirabilium et miraculorum' quod sint media potentiae Divinae, de qua n. 6910; quod `mirabilia' 
sint media potentiae Divinae, est quia per illa adducebantur ad credendum quod Jehovah supremus Deorum esset, {1}immo quod non Deus praeter Ipsum, proinde quod solus colendus; et qui in hoc vero 
erant deinde in vera cultus Ipsius introducti sunt, quae sunt media potentiae, nam omnis potentia in {2}spirituali sensu inest veris quae a Divino, n. 3091, 6344, (x)6423, 6948, 8200; potentia in spirituali 
sensu est fugare et a se ejicere infernalem turbam, quod unice fit per vera; inde nunc est quod per `faciens mirabile' significetur quod a Domino omnia media per quae potentia; {3}media potentiae 
Divinae per `mirabilia' etiam significantur apud Davidem, Cantate Jehovae, psallite Ipsi, meditamini in mirabilibus Ipsius omnibus; gloriamini in nomine sanctitatis Ipsius; quaerite Jehovam et robur 
Ipsius, quaerite facies Ipsius jugiter; memorate mirabilia Ipsius, prodigia Ipsius, et judicia oris Ipsius, Ps. cv 1-5. 	{4} Quod omnis potentia sit veris quae fidei a Domino, patet a Domini verbis 
ad Petrum, Ego tibi dico, Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam Meam, et portae inferni non praevalebunt illi; et dabo tibi claves regni caelorum, Matth. xvi 18, 19; </p>
<p>per `Petrum' 
ibi repraesentatur fides, et per `petram' in Verbo significatur fides, et per `clavem' intelligitur potentia, videatur Praefatio ad Gen. xxii; tum n. 4738 fin., 6344 fin. 	@1 et$ 	@2 spiritualibus$ 	@3
