<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1389节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1389.</strong>进入来世的灵魂们都惊奇地发现，这种与他人思想的交流竟然真的存在，人们马上就能知道别人的信之性质，及其气质的性质。然而，他们被告知，一旦脱离肉体，灵就能获得更卓越的能力。肉身生活时，人有感官物体，以及由这些事物所产生的幻觉的流入，它们因此固定在记忆中；此外，人还有对未来的焦虑、由外在事物所激起的各种欲望；对衣、食、住，以及子女的关注等等，对此，他们在来世不再思想。因此，当这些障碍和阻碍，连同具有粗糙感觉的肉体部分被除去后，他们必处于更完美的状态。同样的能力仍旧存留，但更完美、清晰和自由；尤其那些曾活在仁爱和对主之信中的纯真之人；因为所有这种人的能力都会被大大提升，远远胜过他们肉身状态时所具有的能力，甚至最终被提升至第三层天的天使能力中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1389.</strong> Souls that had arrived in the other life once expressed their surprise to find that another person's thoughts are communicated in this way. They were also amazed that they could instantly tell not only what kind of character that other person had but also what the person's beliefs were.<br />I told them that spirits receive abilities far superior once they separate from their bodies. During physical life, objects of the senses have an impact on us, as do fantasies built out of the impressions those objects leave on our memory, not to mention worries about the future; various cravings aroused by external stimuli; concern over food, clothes, housing, and children; and so on. People in the other life never think about any of these things. When such thoughts are set aside as obstacles and barriers, together with bodily desires connected to the coarser sensations, people cannot help being in a more ideal condition. Their former abilities remain but become much more perfect, lucid, and free. This is especially true with people who have lived lives of charity and faith in the Lord, and of innocence. Their capacities are heightened tremendously over the ones they had in the body, until finally their gifts match those of angels in the third heaven.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the three heavens, of which the third is the highest, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1389/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167" target=_top>167</a>.

Souls that have come into the other life have wondered that there is such a communication of another's thoughts, and that they at once know the quality of another person's faith, as well as that of his 
disposition. But they were told that the spirit receives much more excellent faculties when it has been separated from the body. During the bodily life there is an influx of the objects of the senses; 
and also of phantasy from those things which thence inhere in the memory; besides anxieties for the future; various cupidities that are excited by external things; cares for food, clothing, place 
of abode, children; and other things, concerning which they take no thought in the other life; and therefore on the removal of these obstacles and hindrances, together with the corporeal parts that are 
of gross sensation, they cannot but be in a more perfect state. The same faculties remain, but are much more perfect, clear, and free; especially with those who have lived in charity and faith in the 
Lord, and in innocence; for the faculties of all such are immensely elevated above those which they had in the body, being finally elevated even to the angelic faculties of the third heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1389</b></p><p><b>1389.</b>
Souls who have entered the next life have been amazed that such a communication of another person's thoughts should exist, and that people should know in an instant not only the nature of another person's 
turn of mind but also the nature of his faith. They have been told however that, once separated from the body, the spirit acquires far more excellent capabilities. During his lifetime the objects 
of the senses are flowing in, and also delusions arising from those things which as a consequence are fixed in the memory, in addition to anxieties over the future, various desires aroused by things 
of an external nature, concern about food, clothing, shelter, children, and many other matters, to which they give no thought at all in the next life. When those obstacles and hindrances have therefore 
been removed along with bodily things that are part of mere physical sensation, people enter inevitably into a more perfect state. The same capabilities remain, but these are far more perfect, clear, 
and unrestricted. This is especially so with those who have lived in charity and faith in the Lord, and also in innocence. Their capabilities are heightened enormously, way above those they had had 
during their lifetime, till at length they come up to the angelic capabilities of the third heaven. </p>

</p><b>1389.</b>
Animae quae in alteram vitam venerunt, miratae sunt quod talis communicatio cogitationum alterius daretur, quodque ilico scirent, non solum quali animo sit alter sed etiam quali fide; at illis dictum 
quod spiritus multo excellentiores facultates accipiat cum separatus est a corpore; in vita corporis influunt objecta sensuum, tum phantasiae ab illis quae inhaerent inde memoriae, praeter solicitudines 
de futuris, cupiditates varias excitatas ab externis, curas pro victu, vestitu, habitatione, liberis, et plura, de quibus nihil cogitant in altera vita; quare illis ut remoris et impedimentis cum 
corporeis quae crassae sensationis sunt, remotis, non possunt non in perfectiore statu esse; eaedem facultates remanent sed multo perfectiores, lucidiores, et liberiores; imprimis apud illos qui in charitate 
et fide in Dominum vixerunt inque innocentia, quorum facultates elevantur in immensum supra illas quas habuerunt in corpore, usque tandem ad angelicas tertii caeli. </p>
