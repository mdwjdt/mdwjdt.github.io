<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7313节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7313.</strong>“好在旷野事奉我”表处在模糊中的敬拜。这从“事奉耶和华”和“旷野”的含义清楚可知：“事奉耶和华”是指敬拜；“旷野”是指无人居住和耕种的（参看<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>节），在灵义上是指就信之良善和真理而言的模糊。“旷野”在此之所以表示这种模糊，一般是因为就信之真理而言，“以色列人”所代表的那些属于属灵教会的人处于模糊之中（<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="6289.htm">6289</a>，<a href="6500.htm">6500</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="7233.htm">7233</a>节），尤其是因为当正从侵扰和试探的状态中走出来时，他们处于模糊之中。事实上，那些受侵扰的人被虚假包围并推来搡去，就像风中的芦苇，以致他们从怀疑转向肯定，从肯定转向怀疑。因此，当刚从这种状态上来时，他们处于模糊之中；不过，这种模糊随后逐渐被光照。由于那些经历侵扰的人所处的状态就是这样子，所以以色列人被领进旷野，好叫他们能代表这种状态，就是那些属于属灵教会的人在主来之前所处的状态；也代表如今那些属于这教会并在虚假方面经历消磨的人所处的状态。</p>

That they may serve Me in the wilderness. That this signifies worship in what is obscure, is evident from the signification of "serving Jehovah," as being worship; and from the signification of a "wilderness," 
as being that which is not inhabited and cultivated (see n. 2708, 3900); in the spiritual sense that which is obscure in respect to the good and truth of faith. That "wilderness" here denotes 
such obscurity is because in general they of the spiritual church, who are represented by the sons of Israel, are in obscurity in respect to the truths of faith (n. 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 
2937, 3833, 4402, 6289, 6500, 6865, 6945, 7233); specifically because they are in obscurity when they emerge from a state of infestations and temptations. For they who are in infestations are surrounded 
by falsities, and are shaken like a reed by the wind, thus from doubt to affirmative, and from affirmative to doubt; and therefore when they newly ascend out of this state they are in obscurity, 
but this obscurity is then gradually enlightened. As there is such a state with those who are being infested, therefore the sons of Israel were brought into the wilderness in order that they might represent 
this state, in which were those of the spiritual church before the Lord's coming; and also the state in which they who are of that church are at this day, and are being vastated in respect to 
falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7313</b></p><p><b>7313.</b>
'And let them serve Me in the wilderness' means worship in obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'serving Jehovah' as worship; and from the meaning of 'the wilderness' as that which is uninhabited 
and uncultivated, dealt with in <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="3900.htm">3900</a>, in the spiritual sense obscurity so far as the good and truth of faith are concerned. That kind of obscurity is meant here by 'the wilderness', in general 
because those who belong to the spiritual Church, who are represented by 'the children of Israel', are in obscurity so far as truths of faith are concerned, see <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, and in particular because they are in obscurity when they are emerging from a state of molestations and temptations. For those who are subjected to molestations are surrounded by falsities 
and buffeted by them like a reed by the wind, so that they swing from doubt to positive acceptance and from positive acceptance to doubt. Consequently when they first rise out of that state they 
are in obscurity; but then that obscurity is gradually lightened. Because this is what the state which those undergoing molestations is like, the children of Israel were brought into the wilderness, 
in order that they might represent the condition of those who belonged to the spiritual Church before the Lord's Coming, and also the condition of those who belong to that Church at the present day 
and undergo vastation of falsities. </p>

`Et serviant Mihi in deserto': quod significet cultum in obscuro, constat ex significatione `servire Jehovae' quod sit cultus; et ex significatione `deserti' quod sit quod non habitatum et excultum 
est, de qua n. 2708, 3900, in spirituali sensu quod obscurum quoad bonum et verum fidei; quod hic desertum sit tale obscurum {1}, est quia in genere illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, qui repraesentantur 
per `filios Israelis,' in obscuro {2}sunt quoad vera fidei {3}, videatur n. 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3833, 4402, 6289, 6500, 6865, 6945, 7233; in specie quia in obscuro sunt {4}cum 
e statu infestationum et tentationum emergunt; qui enim in infestationibus {5}sunt, illi a falsis circumfunduntur, et aguntur sicut calamus a vento, sic a dubio in affirmativum et ab affirmativo 
in dubium, inde cum recens e statu illo {6}ascendunt, in obscuro {7}sunt; sed obscurum illud tunc per gradus illustratur; quia talis status (x)est illis qui {8}infestantur, idcirco filii Israelis deducti 
sunt in desertum, ut repraesentarent statum illum in quo fuerunt illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali ante Adventum Domini; et quoque illum in quo sunt qui ab illa Ecclesia hodie, {9}et quoad falsa vastantur. 	@1
