<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10254节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10254</strong>.“香肉桂”表对属世真理的感知和情感。这从“香肉桂”的含义清楚可知，“香肉桂”是指对属世真理的感知和情感，属世真理是外在人的内层真理。人有感官生命和属世生命，或感官层的生命和属世层的生命。二者都属于外在人，但感官生命是外层，从存在于地上和身体里面的物体中获得它的真理；而属世生命是内层，从这些物体的原因中获得它的真理。内在人的生命同样是外层和内层。外层从那些存在于天堂的最低部分里面的事物中获得真理。而内层则从那些存在于天堂的内层部分里面的事物中获得真理。内在人里面的这些真理由接下来的芳香物来表示。<br />“香肉桂”之所以表示对真理的感知和情感，是因为芳香之物或香味表示一种愉悦的感知。这种愉悦的感知是由属于爱的情感产生的，因为感知若有其它任何来源，就不会带来任何愉悦。所有气味都表示感知（参看<a href="3577.htm">3577</a>，<a href="4626.htm">4626</a>，<a href="4748.htm">4748</a>节）；悦人的气味表示对由良善所产生（<a href="1514.htm">1514</a>，<a href="1517.htm">1517</a>-<a href="1519.htm">1519</a>，<a href="4628.htm">4628</a>，<a href="10054.htm">10054</a>节），因而由属于爱的情感所产生的真理的感知；属于感知的气场在灵人和天使当中转化为气味（<a href="4626.htm">4626</a>节）。<br />另外，要知道，用来制备膏油的一切香料或芳香物质都属于属天类别，也就是属于属天国度的事物；而用来合成香的香料或芳香物质则属于属灵类别，也就是属于属灵国度的事物。这也是为何在原文，表示用来制备膏油的香料的这个词与表示用来合成香的香料的那个词是不同的，并且具有不同的词根。因为在圣言中，有些特定词语用来表达属天国度的事物，有些特定词语则用来表达属灵国度的事物；还有些词语是二者共用的。不过，要知道这些词都是什么，首先必须知道，天堂分为两个国度，教会也一样；在属天国度，主导要素是对主之爱的良善，而在属灵国度，主导要素是对邻之仁的良善。至于这些如何彼此有别，可参看9277节提到的地方。<br />此处所提到的香料表示对属天真理的感知和情感，这一点清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />必有臭烂代替香料，绳子代替撕裂，光秃代替美发。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.24.htm">3:24</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是锡安的女子，锡安的女子表示属天教会，在此是指它败坏的时候。因此，表达“香料”的这个词和本节出埃及记经文中的一样。“必有臭烂代替香料”表示必有对邪恶所产生的虚假的感知和情感代替对源于良善的真理的感知和情感，并代替由此而来的生命，而对虚假的感知和情感根本没有任何生命在里面。<br />以西结书：<br />示巴和拉玛的商人用各类上好的香料、各类的宝石和黄金与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.22.htm">27:22</a>）<br />这些话论及推罗，推罗表示教会中关于良善和真理的认知或知识；“示巴和拉玛”表示那些有关于属天事物的认知或知识存在于其中的人。<br />列王纪中提到的示巴女王所表相同：<br />示巴女王将一百二十他连得金子、大批香料和宝石送给所罗门。以后奉来的香料不再有这样多。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.10.htm">10:10</a>）<br />“示巴”主要表示那些有关于属天事物的认知或知识存在于其中的人（参看<a href="1171.htm">1171</a>，<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>节）。由此明显可知，用来制备膏油的这些香料表示对诸如那些在主的属天国度的人所拥有的那种真理的感知和情感。<br />用来制备膏油的香料或芳香物质，也就是品质最高的没药、香肉桂、香菖蒲和桂皮，之所以属于属天类别，也就是属于主的属天国度的事物，是因为“膏油”表示主里面的神性之爱的神性良善，这良善在天上是祂的神性属天物。“膏油”具有这种含义（参看<a href="9954.htm">9954</a>，<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节）。</p>

And aromatic cinnamon. That this signifies the perception and affection of natural truth, is evident from the signification of "aromatic cinnamon," as being the perception and affection of natural truth, 
which truth is the interior truth of the external man; for with man there are sensuous life and natural life, both of the external man; but the sensuous life is exterior, deriving its truths from 
the objects which are on the earth and in the body; and the natural life is interior, deriving its truths from the causes of these objects. The life of the internal man is in like manner exterior and 
interior. The exterior derives its truths from those things which are in the ultimates of heaven; but the interior from those which are in the interiors of heaven; these latter truths are signified by 
the fragrant things which follow. [2] That by "aromatic cinnamon" is signified the perception and affection of truth, is because by what is aromatic is signified perception that is grateful. Such perception 
is from the affection which is of love, for that which is grateful in perception is from no other source. (That all odors signify perception, see n. 3577, 4626, 4748; and that grateful odors 
signify the perception of truth from good, n. 1514, 1517-1519, 4628, 10054, thus from the affection which is of love; and that the spheres of perception are turned into odors with spirits and angels, 
n. 4626.) [3] Be it known further that all those sweet spices from which the oil of anointing was prepared, belong to the celestial class, that is, to those things which are of the celestial kingdom; 
whereas the spices of which the incense was compounded belong to the spiritual class, that is, to those things which are of the spiritual kingdom; and therefore in the original tongue the spices of 
which the oil of anointing was composed are from a different word and derivation than the spices of which the incense was composed; for there are in the Word special words to express those things which 
are of the celestial kingdom; and special words to express those of the spiritual kingdom; and still others which are common to both. But in order that it may be known what these words are, it must 
first be known that heaven is divided into two kingdoms; likewise the church; and that in the celestial kingdom the essential is the good of love to the Lord, whereas in the spiritual kingdom it is the 
good of charity toward the neighbor. (For the difference between these, see the numbers cited in n. 9277.)  [4] That the "spice" which is here mentioned signifies the perception and affection of celestial 
truth, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Instead of spice there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of braided work baldness (Isa. 3:24); </p>
<p>     The subject here treated 
of is the daughters of Zion, by whom is signified the celestial church, in this case perverted; and therefore "spice" is expressed by the same word as in the verse before us; and by "instead of spice 
rottenness" is signified that in the place of the perception and affection of truth from good, and of the consequent life, there shall be the perception and affection of falsity from evil, in which there 
is nothing of life. [5] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The traders of Sheba and Raamah were thy traders in the chief of every spice, and in precious stone and gold (Ezek. 27:22). This was said of Tyre, by which 
are signified the knowledges of good and truth in the church; and by "Sheba and Raamah" are signified those who are in the knowledges of celestial things. [6] In like manner where the queen of Sheba 
is treated of: </p>
<p>     The queen of Sheba gave to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stone; there came no more such a multitude of spice as this 
(1 Kings 10:10) That "Sheba" chiefly denotes those who are in the knowledges of celestial things, see n. 1171, 3240. From all this it is evident that these spices from which the oil of anointing was 
prepared, signify the perception and affection of truth such as are possessed by those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom. [7] The reason why the spices with which the anointing oil was prepared, 
which were noble myrrh, aromatic cinnamon, aromatic calamus, and cassia, belong to the celestial class, that is, to those things which are of the Lord's celestial kingdom, is that the "oil of anointing" 
signified the Divine good of the Divine love in the Lord, which in heaven is His Divine celestial (that the "oil of anointing" has this signification, see n. 9954, 10019). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10254</b></p><p><b>10254.</b>
'And sweet-smelling cinnamon' means the perception of and affection for natural truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'sweet-smelling cinnamon' as the perception of and affection for natural truth, 
which is the interior truth of the external man. A person has life on a sensory level and life on a natural level. Both belong to the external man, but the life on the sensory level is exterior, deriving 
its truths from objects that exist on the planet and in the body, whereas the life on the natural level is interior, deriving its truths from the causes of which those objects are the effects. The 
life of the internal man is in like manner exterior and interior. The exterior derives its truths from those things that exist in the lowest parts of heaven, whereas the interior derives them from 
those things that exist in the interior parts of heaven. These truths within the internal man are meant by the fragrances which follow.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'sweet-smelling cinnamon' means the perception 
of and affection for truth is that 'a sweet smell' means a pleasing perception. A pleasing perception arises from the affection belonging to love, for if perception has any other origin it does 
not bring any pleasure.  </p>
<p>All odours mean perception, see <a href="3577.htm">3577</a>, <a href="4626.htm">4626</a>, <a href="4748.htm">4748</a>.  Pleasing odours mean the perception of truth arising from good, <a href="1514.htm">1514</a>, <a href="1517.htm">1517</a>-<a href="1519.htm">1519</a>, <a href="4628.htm">4628</a>, <a href="10054.htm">10054</a>, thus from the affection belonging 
to love.  The spheres belonging to perceptions are converted among spirits and angels into odours, <a href="4626.htm">4626</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In addition it should be recognized that all the sweet-smelling substances from 
which the anointing oil was prepared belong to the celestial group, that is, to things of the celestial kingdom, whereas the sweet-smelling substances from which the incense was made belong to the spiritual 
group, that is, to things of the spiritual kingdom. This also is why in the original language the term that is used to denote the spices from which the anointing oil was prepared is different 
and has a different root from the term used to denote the spices from which the incense was made. For in the Word there are particular terms which serve to express things of the celestial kingdom and 
particular terms that serve to express those of the spiritual kingdom; and there are others common to both. But to know which of these is which, one must recognize that heaven is divided into two kingdoms, 
as is the Church, and that the dominant essential in the celestial kingdom is the good of love to the Lord, whereas in the spiritual kingdom it is the good of charity towards the neighbour. How 
these differ from each other, see in the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that the spice named here means the perception of and affection for celestial truth is clear in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Instead 
of spice<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> there will be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a falling apart, and instead of well-set hair<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>, baldness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%203:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 3:24</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the daughters of Zion, by whom the celestial Church 
is meant, at this point when it has been perverted. Therefore the word used for spice is the same as that in the present verse in Exodus. 'Instead of spice there will be rottenness' means that instead 
of the perception of and affection for truth springing from good, and of the life these bring with them, there will be a perception of and affection for falsity arising from evil, which holds no 
life at all within it.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The traders of Sheba and Raamah, traders with the best of every spice, and with [every] precious stone, and gold, ... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These things were 
said in reference to Tyre, by which cognitions or knowledge of goodness and truth within the Church are meant, 'Sheba and Raamah' meaning those with whom cognitions of celestial things exist.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
The like is meant where the queen of Sheba is referred to in the first Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>The queen of Sheba gave Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very large quantity of spices, and 
precious stones. No quantity of spices such as this came ever again. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 10:10.  </p>
<p>'Sheba' means primarily those with whom cognitions of celestial things exist, see <a href="1171.htm">1171</a>, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a>.  From all this 
it is evident that these spices from which the anointing oil was prepared mean the perception of and affection for truth such as exist with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The reason 
why the sweet-smelling substances used in the preparation of the anointing oil - which were myrrh of the highest quality, sweet-smelling cinnamon, sweet-smelling calamus, and cassia - belong to 
the celestial group, that is, to things of the Lord's celestial kingdom, is that the anointing oil was the sign of the Divine Good of Divine Love within the Lord, which in heaven is His Divine Celestial. 
For this meaning of 'the anointing oil', see <a href="9954.htm">9954</a>, <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>.

`Et cinnamomum aromaticum': quod significet perceptionem et affectionem veri naturalis, constat ex significatione `cinnamomi aromatici' quod sit perceptio et affectio veri naturalis, quod verum est 
verum externi hominis interius; apud hominem enim est vita sensualis et vita naturalis, utraque externi hominis, sed vita sensualis est exterior ducens sua vera ab objectis quae in tellure sunt et in

sunt, interior autem ab illis quae in interioribus caeli;(n) {1}haec vera significantur per odorata quae sequuntur. 	[2] Quod per `cinnamomum aromaticum' significetur perceptio et affectio veri {2}, 
est quia per `aromaticum' significatur perceptio grata; perceptio grata est ex affectione quae amoris, nam aliunde non est gratum in perceptione; quod omnes odores significent perceptionem, videatur n. 
3577, 4626, 4748, et quod odores grati perceptionem veri ex bono, n. 1514, 1517-1519, 4628, 10,054, ita ex affectione quae amoris, et quod sphaerae perceptionum vertantur in odores apud spiritus et 
angelos, n. 4626. 	[3] Praeterea sciendum est quod omnia illa aromatica ex quibus oleum unctionis {3}parabatur pertineant ad classem caelestem, hoc est, ad illa quae sunt regni caelestis; et aromatica 
ex quibus suffimentum {4}conficiebatur pertineant ad classem spiritualem, hoc est, ad illa quae sunt regni spiritualis; quapropter etiam in lingua originali {5}aromata ex quibus oleum unctionis, ex 
alia voce et derivatione sunt quam aromata, ex quibus suffimentum; sunt enim in Verbo {6}peculiares voces per quas exprimuntur illa quae regni caelestis sunt, et {6}peculiares voces per quas (x)illa quae 
regni spiritualis, et aliae quae communes utrique sunt; sed ut {7}sciatur quaenam illae sunt, notum erit quod caelum in duo regna divisum sit, similiter Ecclesia; et quod in regno caelesti essentiale 
sit bonum amoris in Dominum, at in regno spirituali bonum charitatis erga proximum; quae qualis differentia sit, videatur in numeris citatis n. 9277. 	[4] Quod aroma quod hic {8}nominatur significet 
perceptionem et affectionem veri caelestis, constat apud Esaiam, 	Loco aromatis tabes erit, et loco cinguli (x)discissio, et loco operis implexi calvities, iii 24; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de filiabus Zionis, 
per quas significatur Ecclesia caelestis, ibi perversa; quare dicitur aroma eadem voce qua in hoc versu; et per `loco aromatis tabes' significatur quod loco perceptionis et affectionis veri ex bono, 
ac (x)vitae inde, erit perceptio et affectio falsi ex malo, in qua nihil vitae: apud Ezechielem, [5] 	Negotiatores Schebae et Raamae, negotiatores per primarium omnis aromatis, et per lapidem pretiosum, 
et aurum, xxvii 22; </p>
<p>haec de Tyro dicta sunt, per quam significantur cognitiones boni et veri in Ecclesia; et per `Schebam et Raamam' {9} significantur qui in cognitionibus caelestium sunt: similiter 
ubi agitur de Regina Schebae in Libro Primo Regum, [6] Regina Schebae dedit Schelomoni centum et viginti talenta auri, et aromata multa valde, et lapidem pretiosum; non venit sicut aroma hoc amplius 
quoad multitudinem, x 10; </p>
<p>quod `Scheba' sint praecipue illi qui in cognitionibus caelestium sunt, videatur n. 1171, 3240; ex quibus patet quod haec aromata ex quibus {10}parabatur oleum unctionis,

aromaticum, calamus aromaticus, et casia, pertineant ad classem caelestem, hoc est, ad illa quae regni caelestis Domini sunt, est causa quia oleum unctionis significabat Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris in
