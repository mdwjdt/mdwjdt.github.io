<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第164节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>164.</strong>如前面所说，人的自我全然是恶，显为可见时，它丑陋至极。但是，当主将仁慈和天真注入以后，它就显得美丽可爱了（<a href="154.htm">154</a>节）。仁慈和天真不仅使自我（亦即人的罪恶和错误）获得宽恕，甚至能让它消失不见，好比小孩子，他们的坏与错不仅让人视而不见，甚至让人觉得可爱，只要他们爱父母，爱友伴，显出孩子的天真无邪。由此可知为何只有纯真之人才能进入天堂，如主所说：“让小孩子倒我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在神国的，正是这样的人。我实在告诉你们，凡要承受神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。”于是抱着小孩子，给他们按手，为他们祝福（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.14.htm">10:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.16.htm">16</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]164.</strong> Human selfhood, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_39" target=_top>39</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_59" target=_top>59</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154" target=_top>154</a>], is nothing but evil; presented in visual form it is extremely ugly. But when infused by the Lord with charitable love and innocence, it appears virtuous and lovely, as stated in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154" target=_top>154</a>.<br />Love for our fellow humans and innocence are what excuse self-centeredness, or a person's evil and falsity. Not only do they excuse it, they almost eliminate it, as anyone can see in young children. When toddlers show love to each other and to their parents while glowing with childish innocence, what is actually evil and false in them does not seem so and even gives pleasure.<br />This shows that no one can be let into heaven without some innocence, as the Lord said:<br />"Allow the little children to come to me and do not stop them. These are the kind who make up God's kingdom. Truly, I say to you: anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it." So taking them up into the curve of his arms, he put his hands on them and blessed them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164/bible_king-james-version_mark_10_14-15" target=_top>Mark 10:14-15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164/bible_king-james-version_mark_10_16" target=_top>16</a>) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 164</b></p><p><b>164.</b>
The Own of man, as before stated, is mere evil, and when exhibited to view is most deformed, but when charity and innocence from the Lord are insinuated into the Own, it then appears good and beautiful 
(as before observed, n. 154). Charity and innocence not only excuse the Own (that is, what is evil and false in man), but as it were abolish it, as may be observed in little children, in whom what 
is evil and false is not merely concealed, but is even pleasing, so long as they love their parents and one another, and their infantile innocence shows itself. Hence it may be known why no one can be 
admitted into heaven unless he possesses some degree of innocence; as the Lord has said: </p>
<p>     Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily 
I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them (Mark 10:14-16). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 164</b></p><p><b>164.</b>
As has been stated, man's proprium is nothing but evil, and when presented to view is terribly ugly; but when charity and innocence are instilled into the proprium by the Lord it looks fine and attractive, 
as stated in <a href="154.htm">154</a>. The charity and innocence not only excuse the proprium, that is, a person's evil and falsity, but also virtually do away with it, as anyone may see in the case of young children. 
When they love one another and their parents, and at the same time a childlike innocence is evident, evil and false traits at such times not only go unnoticed but are even pleasing. From this it can 
be seen that nobody is allowed into heaven unless he has some measure of innocence in him, as the Lord said,   Let the young children come to Me and do not hinder them; of such is the kingdom of 
God. Truly I say to you, Whoever has not received the kingdom of God like a young child will not enter into it. Taking them up therefore into His arms, He laid His hands upon them, and blessed them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:14-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:14-16</a>. </p>

</p><b>164.</b>
Proprium hominis, ut dictum, non est nisi malum, et cum sistitur videndum, est deformissimum; at cum charitas et innocentia a Domino insinuatur proprio, apparet bonum et venustam, secundum ea quae dicta 
sunt n. 154.  Charitas et innocentia sunt quae proprium: seu malum et falsum hominis, non solum excusant sed quasi abolent; sicut quisque apud infantes videre potest, qui dum amant se mutuo et parentes, 
et simul infantile innocens elucet, tunc ipsa mala et falsa non solum non apparent sed etiam placent. Inde sciri potest quod nemo in caelum admitti possit nisi aliquid innocentiae habeat; sicut 
Dominus dixit, Sinite infantes venire ad Me, et non prohibete eis, talium est regnum Dei. Amen dico vobis, quisquis non acceperit regnum Dei ut infans, non ingredietur in illud. Suscipiens igitur illos 
in ulnas, posuit manus super illos, et benedixit illis, Marc. x 14-16  </p>
