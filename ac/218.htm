<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第218节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>218.</strong>创世记3:8 在天起凉风之日，那人和他妻子听见耶和华神的声音在园中回响，就藏在园里的树中，躲避耶和华神的面。<br />“耶和华神的声音在园中回响”，表示有内在的声音，让他们感觉害怕，这声音是他们保留的一丝觉知。“天起凉风之日”，表教会仍保着一丝觉知的时期，“躲避耶和华神的面”，表示他们害怕内在的声音，正如有罪恶感的人所畏惧的。“藏在园里的树中”，表藏在属世的良善中，“中”表核心，“树”表觉知，和前面一样。他们仅留有一丝觉知，故“树”是单数，好似说只有一棵树还在。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]218.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_218/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_8" target=_top>Genesis 3:8</a>. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God, going alone in the garden at the breeze of the day. And the human hid himself, as did his wife, from Jehovah God's face, in the middle of the tree of the garden.<br />The voice of Jehovah God, going alone in the garden, means an inner dictate, which [the people of this generation] dreaded. The inner call was the trace of perception they kept. The breeze of the day symbolizes the era when the church still retained a trace of perception. Hiding themselves from Jehovah God's face means fearing the inner dictate, as those who are conscious of their evil do. The middle of the tree of the garden, in which they hid themselves, symbolizes earthly good. The word middle refers to the deepest core. A tree is perception, as noted before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_218/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_102" target=_top>102</a>]; but since they had little perception, the word is used in the singular, as if only one tree were left. </p>

Verse 8. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God going to itself in the garden in the air of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst the tree of the 
garden. By the "voice of Jehovah God going to itself in the garden" is signified an internal dictate which caused them to feel afraid, this dictate being the residue of the perception which they had 
possessed; by the "air" or "breath" of the "day" is denoted a period when the church still possessed some residue of perception; to "hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God" is to fear the dictate, 
as is wont to be the case with those who are conscious of evil; by the "midst of the tree of the garden" in which they hid themselves, is signified natural good; that which is inmost is called the 
"midst;" the "tree" denotes perception as before; but because there was little perception remaining, the tree is spoken of in the singular number, as if there were only one remaining. </p>

Verse 8 And they heard Jehovah God's voice going to and fro in the garden in the breeze of the daytime; and the man hid himself, and so did his wife, from the face of Jehovah God, in the middle of the 
tree of the garden.  </p>
<p>'Jehovah God's voice going to and fro in the garden' means a dictate which filled them with fear. This dictate is the residue they had of perception. 'The breeze, or breath,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
of the daytime' means a time when the Church still had a residue of perception. 'Hiding themselves from the face of Jehovah God' is being afraid of this dictate, as people conscious of evil normally 
are. 'The middle of the tree of the garden in which they hid themselves' means natural good; that which is Inmost is called 'the middle', and perception a tree', as stated already. But because only a 
little perception remained 'tree' is used in the singular, as though only one were left.

Vers. 8.  Et audiverunt vocem Jehovae Dei, sibi euntem in horto, ad auram diei, et occultavit se homo, et uxor ejus, a facie Jehovae Dei, in medio arboris horti. Per 'vocem Jehovae Dei sibi euntem in 
horto' intelligitur dictamen quod metuebant; dictamen est residuum perceptionis quod habebant: per 'auram {1} (seu spiritum) diei significatur tempus cum adhuc Ecclesia residuum haberet de perceptione: 
per 'occultare se a facie Jehovae Dei' est timere dictamen sicut solent qui conscii mali: per 'medium arboris horti, in quo es occultabant' significatur bonum naturale; 'medium' dicitur, quod intimum; 
'arbor' est perceptio ut dictum prius; sed quia parum perceptionis, in singulari dicitur 'arbor,' sicut una residua. @	1 Parentheses inserted, not in I.$ </p>
