<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8210节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8210.</strong>“法老一切的马匹、战车和马兵都进入海中间”表属于败坏理解力的记忆知识，支持虚假的教义事物，以及推理，它们充满地狱。这从“法老的马匹”、“法老的战车”、“法老的马兵”和“海中间”的含义清楚可知：“法老的马匹”是指属于一种败坏理解力的记忆知识；“法老的战车”是指支持虚假的教义事物；“法老的马兵”是指基于这些的推理（关于这一切，可参看<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；“海中间”是指充满地狱。<br />经上之所以在此再次提及法老军队的这三样，即马匹、战车和马兵，是因为那些属于教会，陷入与仁分离之信，并过着邪恶生活的人荒凉的最后状态现在近在眼前，这种状态是被投入地狱的状态；被投入地狱就是被邪恶所生的虚假包围。事实上，当恶人在一切真理和良善上被荒凉，并且陷入其生活的邪恶和由这邪恶所生的虚假时，通过其生活的邪恶与他们相通的地狱就被打开；然后他们归为己有的所有这些邪恶从那里迅速集中在他们身上，于是从邪恶所涌出的虚假构成一个气场包围他们，这气场看似一片密云或水。一旦这一切发生，他们就在地狱中；因为现在他们关闭了与天堂的一切联系，还与其它地狱分离。这就是所谓的“投入地狱”。<br />这就是为什么现在当他们进入海中间时，经上会提到“马匹、战车和马兵”；因为如前所述，“红海”表示地狱；“马匹、战车和马兵”表示一切虚假，构成邪恶所生的虚假的一切事物，这些虚假现在都被放进他们里面，好叫邪恶所生的虚假能以这种方式凭其性质而与其它所有地狱分离。这些就是接下来的几节经文（14:24-28）所特别论述的主题。</p>

All Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea. That this signifies memory-knowledges from a perverted understanding, doctrinal things of falsity, and reasonings, that 
they filled hell, is evident from the signification of the "horses of Pharaoh," as being memory-knowledges from a perverted understanding; from the signification of the "chariots of Pharaoh," as being 
doctrinal things of falsity; from the signification of the "horsemen of Pharaoh," as being reasonings therefrom (concerning all which see above, n. 8146, 8148); and from the signification of "into 
the midst of the sea," as being to fill hell.  [2] That these three things of Pharaoh's army, namely, horses, chariots, and horsemen, are here mentioned again, is because the last state of the devastation 
of those of the church who had been in faith separate from charity and in a life of evil is now at hand, which state is the state of being cast into hell; and to be cast into hell is to be crowded 
by falsities from evil. For when the evil have been devastated as to all truth and good and have been left to the evil of their life and to the falsity thence derived, then the hells with which they 
had communicated by the evils of their life are opened, and then all those evils which they have appropriated to themselves rush into them, and the falsities which pour forth from the evils then constitute 
a sphere around them, which sphere appears like a dense cloud, or like water. When this takes place, they are then in hell; for they are then shut off from all communication with heaven, and are 
also separated from other hells. This is called "casting into hell."  [3] This is the reason why now, when they entered into the midst of the sea, mention is made of "horses, chariots, and horsemen;" 
for as already said, the "sea Suph" signifies hell; and "horses, chariots, and horsemen" signify all the falsities and all things of falsity from evil, which are now let into them in order that in 
this manner they may be separated from the other hells by the whole nature of falsity from evil. These are the subjects specifically treated of in the verses which now follow (verses 24 to 28). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8210</b></p><p><b>8210.</b>
'All Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen - into the middle of the sea' means factual knowledge belonging to a perverted understanding, doctrinal teachings upholding falsity, and reasonings 
- that they filled hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's horses' as factual knowledge belonging to a perverted understanding, from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's chariots' as doctrinal teachings 
upholding falsity, and from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's horsemen' as reasonings based on these, all dealt with above in <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; and from the meaning of 'into the middle of the sea' as filling 
hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why these three that were constituents of Pharaoh's army - horses, chariots, and horsemen - are now mentioned again here is that the final state in the vastation of those belonging 
to the Church who have championed faith separated from charity and led a life of evil is now at hand. This state is one of being cast into hell; and being cast into hell is being crowded around by 
falsities arising from evil. For when all the truth and goodness residing with the evil have been laid waste and those people have been abandoned to the evil and the falsity arising from it that have 
ruled their lives, the hells with which they have been in contact through the evils ruling their lives are opened. From there all the evils which they have made their own rapidly converge on them, and 
the falsities which well out of the evils constitute then the sphere surrounding them, a sphere which looks like a thick cloud, or like water. Once all this has taken place they are in hell, for now 
they have been shut off from all contact with heaven, and also have been separated from other hells. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The expression 'being cast into hell' is used to mean this. This is the reason why the horses, 
chariots, and horsemen are mentioned now, when they went into the middle of the sea; for as has been stated, 'the Sea Suph' means hell, and 'horses, chariots, and horsemen' all the falsities and everything 
constituting falsity arising from evil which were loosed onto those people, in order that the falsity arising from evil, by its very nature, might separate them from all other hells. These are 
the matters which are dealt with specifically in verses 24-28 that immediately follow. </p>

</p><b>8210.</b>
`Omnes equi Pharaonis, currus illius, et equites illius, in medium maris': quod significet scientifica ex intellectuali perverso, doctrinalia falsi, et ratiocinia, quod implerent infernum, constat ex 
significatione `equorum Pharaonis' quod sint scientifica ex intellectuali perverso; ex significatione `curruum Pharaonis' quod sint doctrinalia falsi, et ex significatione `equitum Pharaonis' quod sint 
ratiocinia {1}inde, de quibus omnibus (d)supra n. 8146, 8148; et ex significatione `in medium maris' {2} quod sit implere infernum. 	2 Quod hic nunc iterum memorentur haec tria quae fuerunt exercitus 
Pharaonis, nempe equi, currus, et equites, est quia nunc adest ultimus status devastationis illorum qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt in fide separata a charitate et in vita mali, {3}qui status est status 
conjectionis in infernum; et conjectio in infernum est constipatio a falsis e malo; cum enim mali {4}devastati sunt quoad omne verum et bonum, ac relicti suae vitae malo et inde falso, tunc aperiuntur 
inferna cum quibus per mala vitae suae communicaverant; inde irruunt in illos omnia illa mala quae sibi appropriaverunt, falsa quae ex malis exundant constituunt tunc sphaeram circum illos, quae sphaera 
apparet {5} sicut densa nubes, vel sicut aqua; cum hoc factum est, tunc in inferno sunt, nam tunc {6}seclusi sunt ab omni communicatione cum caelo, et quoque tunc {7}separati ab infernis aliis; hoc 
dicitur conjectio in infernum; haec causa est quod nunc, cum intrarent in medium 3 maris, memorentur equi, currus, et equites, nam, ut dictum est, `mare Suph' significat infernum, (c)ac `equi, currus, 
et equites' omnia falsa (c)et omnia falsi ex malo quae nunc in illos immissa sunt, ut sic per omne quale falsi ex malo a reliquis infernis {8}separentur; haec sunt de quibus in versibus nunc sequentibus 
24-28 in specie agitur. 	@1 d inde i falsa$ 	@2 i nempe venire seu intrare,$ 	@3 d qui i ultimus ille$ 	@4 vastati$ 	@5 i vel$ 	@6 remoti et separati$ 	@7 distincti sunt$ 	@8 distinguantur$ </p>
