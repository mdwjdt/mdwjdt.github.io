<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9812节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9812.</strong>“以利亚撒、以他玛”表神性属世层方面。这从以下事实清楚可知：他们是亚伦的小儿子，亚伦代表神性属天层方面的主；因此，他的儿子代表神性的后续层级方面的主。也就是说，两个大儿子代表神性属灵层方面的主；而两个小儿子代表神性属世层方面的主。因为这就是诸天堂里的神性良善彼此相随所遵循的次序；事实上，处于这些良善的诸天堂本身也遵循这样的次序。此外，一种良善通过另一种良善产生并持续存在。<br />构成第三层或至内层天堂的神性属天良善是对主之爱的良善；构成中间或第二层天堂的神性属灵良善是对邻之仁的良善；构成第一层或最低层天堂的神性属世良善是信仰和服从的良善。神性属世良善包括在所有公民当中被称为正义的文明良善，以及由属于体面行为的所有美德构成的道德良善。<br />这三种良善就像目的、原因和结果那样彼此相随。正如目的是原因的灵魂，原因是结果中的一切有效力量，属天良善是属灵良善的灵魂，属灵良善则是属世良善中的一切。在别的东西里面为灵魂、为一切的，就在它里面，如同努力在动作里面，或意愿在行动里面。意愿是行动里面的灵魂和一切，这是显而易见的，因为当意愿停止时，行动也就停止了。由此可见属天层、属灵层和属世层是怎么回事；也就是说，属世良善里面从至内在必有属天良善，即对主之爱的良善，也就是纯真的良善。</p>

Eleazar and Ithamar. That this signifies in respect to the Divine natural, is evident from the fact that these were the younger sons of Aaron, and that by Aaron is represented the Lord as to the Divine 
celestial; wherefore by his sons is represented the Lord as to the Divine which succeeds in order; thus by the elder sons is represented the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; and by the younger sons 
the Lord as to the Divine natural; for the Divine goods in the heavens succeed in this order; nay, the heavens themselves which are in these goods do so. Moreover, one good comes forth, and also subsists, 
through another. [2] Divine celestial good, which makes the third or inmost heaven, is the good of love to the Lord; Divine spiritual good, which makes the middle or second heaven, is the good 
of charity toward the neighbor; and Divine natural good, which makes the first or ultimate heaven, is the good of faith and of obedience. To Divine natural good pertains also civil good, which is called 
what is just among citizens; and also moral good, which is that of all the virtues that belong to what is honorable.  [3] These three goods follow in order, like end, cause, and effect; and as the 
end is the soul of the cause, and the cause is all that is efficient in the effect, so celestial good is the soul of spiritual good, and spiritual good is everything in natural good. That which is the 
soul, and that which is everything, in something else, is within it, as endeavor is in motion, or as will is in action. That will is the soul and everything in action, is plain, for when will ceases, 
action ceases. From all this it can be seen how the case is with the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural; namely, that inmostly in natural good there must be celestial good, that is, the good 
of love to the Lord, which also is the good of innocence. </p>

'Eleazar and Ithamar' means in respect of the Divine Natural. This is clear from the fact that they were Aaron's younger sons; and since Aaron represents the Lord in respect of the Divine Celestial his 
sons too represent the Lord in respect of succeeding levels of what is Divine. That is, the older ones represent the Lord in respect of the Divine Spiritual, while the younger represent Him in respect 
of the Divine Natural. For this is the order in which the levels of Divine Good in the heavens follow one another; indeed the actual heavens in which such levels of good exist follow one another in 
that same order. Also one level of good comes into being and is also kept in being through another.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Divine Celestial Good, which composes the third or inmost heaven, is the good of love to the 
Lord. Divine Spiritual Good, which composes the middle or second heaven, is the good of charity towards the neighbour. And Divine Natural Good, which composes the first or lowest heaven, is the good 
of faith and obedience. Divine Natural Good includes public good, which is called justice among all citizens, and also private good, which consists of all the virtues that constitute honourable behaviour. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Those three levels of good follow one another in order as end, cause, and effect. And just as the end is the soul of the cause, and the cause is the all and the efficient power in the effect, 
so is celestial good the soul of spiritual good, and spiritual good the all in natural good. That which is the soul in another, and that which is the all there, are inwardly present as effort is 
within motion or as will is within action. The fact that the will is the soul and the all in action is self-evident, for when will ceases, so does action. All this makes clear what the situation is 
with the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural; that is to say, inmostly within natural good there must be celestial good, that is, the good of love to the Lord, which also is the good of innocence.  </p>

`Eleazar et Ithamar': quod significet quoad Divinum Naturale, constat ex eo quod filii minorennes Aharonis essent, et per Aharonem repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum Caeleste, ideo per filios ejus 
repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum, quod ordine succedit, ita per majorennes Dominus quoad Divinum Spirituale, et per minorennes quoad Divinum Naturale; {1}eo enim ordine succedunt Divina Bona in {2}caelis, 
immo succedunt ipsi caeli qui in illis bonis sunt; existit etiam unum bonum per alterum, et quoque subsistit. 	Divinum Bonum Caeleste, quod facit caelum tertium seu intimum, 2 est bonum amoris 
in Dominum; Divinum Bonum Spirituale, quod facit caelum medium seu secundum, est bonum charitatis erga proximum; et Divinum Bonum Naturale, quod facit caelum primum seu ultimum, est bonum fidei et 
oboedientiae; ad Divinum Bonum Naturale (t)pertinet etiam bonum civile, quod {3}vocatur justum inter cives, {4}et (d)quoque bonum morale, quod est {5}omnium virtutum quae sunt honesti; illa tria bona 
{6} ordine consequuntur, {7}sicut finis, causa, et 3 effectus; et sicut finis est anima causae, et causa est omne efficiens in effectu, ita bonum caeleste est anima boni spiritualis, et bonum spirituale 
est omne in bono naturali; quod est anima, et quod est omne {8} in alio, id ei inest sicut conatus motui, seu sicut voluntas actioni, quod voluntas sit {9}anima et omne in actione, patet, nam cessante 
voluntate cessat actio; ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum caelesti, spirituali, et naturali, quod nempe in bono naturali intime erit bonum caeleste, hoc est, bonum amoris in Dominum, quod 
etiam est bonum innocentiae. @1 hoc$ @2 coelo$ @3 est$ @4 tum$ @5 honestum$ @6 i eo$ @7 quo$ @8 i efficiens$ @9 omni actionis, ita omne quod in actione vivit$ </p>
