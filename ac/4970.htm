Verses 2-6. And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his lord the Egyptian. And his lord saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did 
to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his eyes, and he ministered to him; and he set him over his house, and all that he had he gave into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that 
he set him over in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was in all that he had, in the house and in the field. 
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was beautiful in form, and beautiful in look. "And Jehovah was with 
Joseph," signifies that the Divine was in the celestial of the spiritual; "and he was a prosperous man," signifies that all things were provided; "and he was in the house of his lord the Egyptian," signifies 
that it might be initiated into natural good; "and his lord saw that Jehovah was with him," signifies that it was perceived in natural good that the Divine was therein; "and that Jehovah made 
all that he did to prosper in his hand," signifies that all things were of the Divine providence; "and Joseph found grace in his eyes," signifies that it was accepted; "and he ministered to him," signifies 
that the memory-knowledge was appropriated to its good; "and he set him over his house," signifies that good applied itself thereto; "and all that he had he gave into his hand," signifies that 
all that belonged to it was as it were in its power; "and it came to pass from the time that he set him over in his house, and over all that he had," signifies a second state after good applied itself 
thereto, and all that belonged to it was as it were in its power; "that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake," signifies that from the Divine it then had the celestial natural; "and 
the blessing of Jehovah," signifies increase; "was in all that he had, in the house and in the field," signifies in life and in doctrine; "and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand," signifies that 
it appeared as if all things were in its power; "and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat" signifies that good was thence made its own; "and Joseph was beautiful in form," 
signifies the good of life thence derived; "and beautiful in look," signifies the truth of faith thence derived. </p>

Verses 2-6 And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his lord the Egyptian. And his lord saw that Jehovah was with him, and everything that he did Jehovah made 
it to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found favour in his eyes, and ministered to him; and he put him in charge over his house, and whatever he had he gave into his hand. And it happened from the 
time he put him in charge in his house and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and he blessing of Jehovah was on all that he had in the house and in the 
field. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and did not concern himself with anything<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> except the bread that he ate. And Joseph was beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah 
was with Joseph' means that the Divine existed within the celestial of the spiritual. And he was a prosperous man' means that all things had been provided. 'And he was in the house of his lord the 
Egyptian' means to enable it to be introduced into natural good. And his lord saw that Jehovah was with him' means a perception within natural good that the Divine existed within it. And everything 
that he did Jehovah made to prosper in his hand' means that all things were the conferments of Divine Providence. And Joseph found favour in his eyes' means that it had found acceptance. And ministered 
to him' means that factual knowledge was assigned to its own good. And he put him in charge over his house' means that this good applied itself to that factual knowledge. And whatever he had he gave 
into his hand' means that all that belonged to that good was seemingly subject to the power and control of its associated truth. And it happened from the time he put him in charge in his house and over 
all that he had' means a second state, after this good had applied itself to that truth and had made all that belonged to it seemingly subject to the power and control of that truth. That Jehovah blessed 
the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake' means that at this point the Divine imparted the celestial-natural to that truth. 'And the blessing of Jehovah was' means increases. 'On all that he had 
in the house and in the field' means in life and in doctrine. 'And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand' means that it seemed as though all things were subject to its power and control. And did not 
concern himself with anything except the bread that he ate' means that the good from there was its own. And Joseph was beautiful in form means the good of life springing from this. 'And beautiful in 
appearance' means the truth of faith springing from it.
