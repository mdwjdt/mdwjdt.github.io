<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6310.</strong>人的内层通过衍生而被划分为不同层级，并照着这些层级而处于不同层面的光。离身体感官最近的内在感官层面拥有最暗淡、最粗鄙的光。我通过大量经历得以认识这光，还注意到，每当我降至这光时，各种各样的虚假和邪恶就会出现，甚至连对天上神性事物的诽谤也会出现，更不用说污秽、肮脏的东西了。原因在于，这光盛行于地狱，地狱主要通过这光流入人内。<br />当人处于这种光时，他的思维拥有接近于他的外在视觉所拥有的那种光，几乎处在身体层面。处于这种光的人被称为感官人，因为他们的思维没有上升到通过身体所获得的感官印象之上。这种人既觉察不到，也不相信超出感官的事物，只相信他们能看见并摸到的东西。那些根本不留意更内在事物的人便处于这光；他们在生活中忽视或轻视一切理性和属灵事物。贪婪的人和通奸者，以及那些过着只追求享乐，或可耻的懒惰生活之人尤其处于这光。因此，这种人的思维是污秽的，他们对教会的神圣事物常抱有可耻的态度。</p>

The interiors of man are distinct according to degrees by means of derivations, and according to these degrees are also the lights. The internal sensuous, which is nearest the sensuous things of the 
body, has the most gross light. This light it has been given me to discern by much experience, and I have noticed that whenever I sank into this light, falsities and evils of many kinds presented themselves, 
and even things scandalous against heavenly and Divine things, besides things filthy and foul. The reason is that this light rules in the hells, and by means of it chiefly do the hells flow into 
man. When a man is in this light, his thought is in nearly the same light as that in which is his external sight, and is then almost in the body. Men who are in this light are to be called the Sensuous, 
for they do not think beyond the sensuous things of the body. What is beyond these they neither perceive nor believe, believing only that which they see and touch. In this light are they who have 
not at all cultivated things interior, living in neglect and contempt of all things rational and spiritual; and in this light are especially the avaricious and adulterers, and they who have lived in 
mere pleasures and in disgraceful idleness, and who consequently think what is filthy, and often what is scandalous, about the holy things of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6310</b></p><p><b>6310.</b>
A person's interiors are divided into separate degrees through derivation from one another; and in keeping with those degrees they also differ in the level of light they possess. The light on the internal 
sensory level next to the bodily senses is the dullest, a light that much experience has enabled me to recognize. I have also noticed that every time I have descended to this degree of light falsities 
and evils of many a kind have presented themselves, indeed even slanders against what is heavenly and Divine, not to mention things of a foul and disgusting nature. The reason why is that this 
kind of light prevails in hell, and hell enters a person by means of this light especially. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When this is the kind of light a person has, his thought possesses virtually the same kind of light as 
his external sight, and takes place almost on the level of the body. People who see in this kind of light must be called sensory-minded, for their thought does not rise beyond sensory impressions received 
by the body. Such people do not have any perception of or belief in things that lie beyond the senses; they believe only what they can see and touch. This is the light that people see by who have 
not devoted any attention whatever to more internal things; in life they have neglected or treated with contempt everything of a rational or spiritual nature. It is the light that avaricious persons 
and adulterers in particular see by, also those who have led lives of mere pleasure-seeking or lives that have been disgustingly lazy. The thoughts of such people are consequently foul, and they often 
entertain disgraceful attitudes towards the holy things of the Church. </p>

Interiora hominis distincta sunt secundum gradus per derivationes, secundum illos gradus sunt etiam luces; sensuale internum quod proximum est sensualibus corporis, habet lumen crassissimum; hoc lumen 
mihi datum est discernere {1} per multam experientiam; et observatum quoties in hoc lumen delapsus fuerim, quod toties obvenerint falsa et mala plurium generum, immo etiam scandalosa contra caelestia 
et Divina, ac praeterea spurca et foeda; causa est quia hoc lumen dominatur in infernis, ac inferna per id imprimis apud hominem influunt; [2] cum in hoc lumine est homo, est cogitatio ejus {2}fere 
in (x)simili lumine in quo {3} ejus visus externus, et est tunc paene in corpore; homines qui in hoc lumine sunt, vocandi sunt sensuales, nam non ultra sensualia corporis cogitant quae ultra illa sunt, 
{4}nec percipiunt nec credunt, solum id credunt quod vident et tangunt.  In illo lumine sunt illi qui interiora prorsus non excoluerunt, vivendo in neglectu et contemptu omnium quae rationalia et spiritualia 
sunt; et in illo lumine sunt imprimis avari et adulteri, tum qui in meris voluptatibus, ac in turpi otio, vixerunt; inde hi {5} spurca cogitant, et de sanctis Ecclesiae saepe scandalosa. @1
