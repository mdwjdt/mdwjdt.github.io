<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2541节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2541.</strong>“把他的众臣仆召来”表理性事物和记忆知识。这从“臣仆”（即仆人servant）的含义清楚可知，“臣仆”的含义等到14节（<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>节）时会进一步予以详述。在主的国度，或就是主的国度之人里面都有属天事物、属灵事物、理性事物、记忆知识和感官印象；所有这些按一个在另一下之下的顺序进行排列。属天事物和属灵事物占据第一位，是主的；理性事物依次在它们之下，并顺从它们；记忆知识相应地在理性事物之下，并服侍它们；最后感官印象在记忆知识之下并服侍它们。在它们的关系中，顺从或服侍的事物就是仆人，在圣言中被称作“仆人”。凡只通过感官印象和记忆知识思考的人都没有意识到这些事物按适当顺序存在；人即使对它们有所了解，也只有一个极其模糊的概念，因为他仍沉浸于肉体事物；但天使却有着极为清晰的概念；因为天使所具有的数千，甚至无数不同观念只向人呈现为一个模糊的观念。例如此处这些话：“亚比米勒把他的众臣仆召来，在他们耳边将所有这些事都说了，这些男人都甚惧怕”；天使从这些话中所觉察到的奥秘，比人所能理解，甚至所能想象的还要深，也就是说，他们能发觉主如何使理性事物和记忆知识变得顺从；事实上是以这种方式，即主使起来反对教义的属天事物和属灵事物的情感变得顺从，而不是使理性事物和记忆知识顺从；因为使这些情感顺从了，理性事物和记忆知识也就相应地顺从了，并归入秩序。这些事对天使来说，只是一些最普通、最一般的事，但对人来说，恐怕是一些最模糊或难以理解的事。</p>

And called all his servants. That this signifies rational things and memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification in the Word of "servants" (concerning which hereafter at verse 14, n. 2567). 
In a man who is in the Lord's kingdom, or who is the Lord's kingdom, there are celestial things, spiritual things, rational things, memory-knowledges, and things of sense; and these are in subordination 
to one another. Celestial and spiritual things hold the first place, and are the Lord's; to these rational things are subordinate, and are subservient; to these again memory-knowledges are subordinate 
and subservient; and lastly the things of sense are subordinate and subservient to these, that is to memory-knowledges. The things which are subservient, or which serve, are relatively servants, and 
in the Word are called "servants." That there is such a subordination, the man who thinks only from sense and memory-knowledge is ignorant; and he who knows anything of them nevertheless has a most 
obscure idea, because he is still in corporeal things; but the angels have a most distinct idea; for thousands, nay myriads, of ideas that to the angels are distinct, present nothing but a single obscure 
idea to men. For example, in regard to Abimelech calling his servants and speaking all the words in their ears, and the men fearing greatly, the angels perceive deeper arcana than man can possibly 
apprehend, or can even believe-namely, how the Lord reduced rational things and memory-knowledges to obedience; and indeed in such manner that He reduced to obedience not the rational things and memory-knowledges 
themselves, but the affections that rose up against the celestial and spiritual things of doctrine, for on the subjugation of these the rational things and memory-knowledges were reduced 
to obedience, and at the same time into order. To the angels, these are among the most common things; but to man they are perchance among those which are most obscure or unintelligible to him. </p>

'And called his servants' means rational concepts and factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'servants' in the Word, dealt with further on at verse 14, in <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>. Within the person who is 
in the Lord's kingdom, that is, who is the Lord's kingdom, there are celestial things, spiritual things, rational concepts, factual knowledge, and sensory impressions; and all these are ordered one beneath 
another. Celestial things and spiritual things hold the primary position and are the Lord's; rational concepts come next in order beneath them and are subservient to them; factual knowledge in 
turn comes beneath and serves rational concepts; and lastly sensory impressions come beneath and serve factual knowledge. The things which are subservient, or which serve, are in these relationships servants, 
and in the Word they are called 'servants'. Anyone whose thought is based solely on sensory impressions and factual knowledge is unaware of these things existing in their ordered sequence; and 
anyone who does know something about them nevertheless has only a very obscure idea because he is still immersed in bodily interests. Angels however have a very distinct idea, for thousands, indeed 
myriads, of distinct and separate ideas existing with angels do not present themselves to men except as one single obscure idea, as for example with the words that occur here, 'Abimelech called his servants 
and spoke all these words in their ears; and the men were very much afraid'. In these words angels perceive deeper arcana than man can possibly grasp or is indeed able to believe; that is to say, 
they perceive how the Lord brought rational concepts and factual knowledge into a condition of obedience, yet in such a way that He did not bring into that condition the rational concepts and the factual 
knowledge themselves but the affections rising up against the celestial and the spiritual things of doctrine; for it was when those affections had been brought into subjection that rational concepts 
and factual knowledge were brought into a condition of obedience and at the same time into order. These matters are to angels some of the most common and general; but to man they are perhaps some 
of the most obscure or are unintelligible. </p>

`Et vocavit servos suos': quod significet rationalia et scientifica, constat ex significatione `servorum' in Verbo, de qua in sequentibus ad vers. 14, n. 2567.  Sunt in homine qui in regno Domini, seu 
qui regnum Domini est, caelestia, spiritualia, rationalia, scientifica et sensualia; haec inter se subordinata sunt; caelestia et spiritualia primas tenent, ac Domini sunt, rationalia illis subordinata 
sunt (c)et inserviunt, scientifica his iterum subordinata sunt et serviunt, sensualia demum his seu scientificis; quae inserviunt seu serviunt {1}, sunt respective servi, et vocantur in Verbo servi; 
quod talis subordinati sit, homo qui ex sensualibus et {2} scientificis solum cogitat, ignorat, et qui aliquid de iis scit, usque obscurissimam ideam habet, quia i corporeis adhuc est, angeli autem 
distinctissimam; millia enim immo myriades idearum distinctarum apud angelos non nisi quam unam obscuram apud homines sistunt, ut pro exemplo, de his quo `Abimelechus vocavit servos suos, et locutus 
est omnia verba in auribus eorum, et quod timuerint viri valde,' percipiunt angeli arcaniora quam usquam homo capit, immo quam credere potest, nempe quomodo Dominus redegerit rationalia et scientifica 
ad oboedientiam, et quidem: ita, quod non ipsa rationalia et scientifica, sed affectiones assurgentes adversus doctrinae caelestia et spiritualia, nam his subjugatis rationalia et scientifica ad oboedientiam 
redacta sunt; et simul tunc in ordinem: haec sunt angelis inter communissima, quae fortassis homini sunt inter ejus obscurissima, aut non intelligibilia. {3} 	@1 sensualia quae quia serviunt.$ 	@2 
i ex.$ 	@3 A is obscure and differs from I. It runs nam his nempe affectionibus subjugatis rationalia et scientifica ad obedientiam redacta sunt; et simul tunc ordinem quae apud spiritus in 
perverso statu fuerunt, sic continue per vitae suae cursum in mundo; hoc scire angelis est inter communissima, quod fortassis homini est inter ejus obscurissima aut non intelligibilia.$ </p>
