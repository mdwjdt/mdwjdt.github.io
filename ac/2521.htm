<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2521节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2521.</strong>创世记5:5. 那人岂不是自己对我说，她是我妹子吗？连她自己也说，他是我的哥哥。我做这事是心正手洁的。<br />“那人岂不是自己对我说”表为有这样的想法而辩解。“她是我妹子”表当请教的是理性。“连她自己也说，他是我的哥哥”表理性本身因此声称属天良善要与它结合。“心正”表出于纯真简单的良善这样想。“我做这事是手洁的”表出于对真理的情感，因而出于使人如此思想的全部能力。</p>

Verse 5. Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she herself also said, He is my brother: in the uprightness of my heart and in the blamelessness of my hands have I done this. "Said he not 
himself unto me," signifies exculpation for having so thought; "she is my sister," signifies that it was the rational which should be consulted; "and she herself also said, He is my brother," signifies 
that the rational itself so dictated that celestial good should be adjoined to it; "in the uprightness of my heart," signifies that it was so thought from innocence and simple good; "and in the blamelessness 
of my hands have I done this," signifies from the affection of truth, and so with all ability. </p>

Verse 5 Did he not say to me, She is my sister? And she herself also said, He is my brother. In the uprightness of my heart and in the blamelessness of my hands have I done this. </p>
<p>'Did he not say to 
me' means exoneration from having thought in this fashion. 'She is my sister' means that it was the rational which ought to be consulted. 'And she herself also said, He is my brother' means that the 
rational itself so declared that celestial good should be coupled with it. 'In the uprightness of my heart' means that such thinking was the product of innocence and simple good. 'And in the blamelessness 
of my hands have I done this' means the product of the affection for truth, and thus of all that enables one so to think. </p>

Vers. 5.  Nonne ille dixit mihi, Soror mea haec? et ipsa etiam illa dixit, Frater meus ille.  In rectitudine cordis mei, et in immunitate manuum mearum, feci hoc. `Nonne ille dixit mihi' significat 
exculpationem quod ita cogitaverit: `Soror mea haec' significat quod rationale esset quod consuleretur: `et ipsa etiam illa dixit, Frater meus ille' significat quod ipsum rationale ita dictaret quod bonum 
caeleste sibi adjunctum foret: `in rectitudine cordis mei' significat quod ita cogitatum ex innocentia et simplici bono: `et in immunitate manuum mearum feci hoc' significat ex affectione veri et 
sic ex omni facultate. </p>
