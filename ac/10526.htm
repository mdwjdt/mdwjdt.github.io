<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10526节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10526</strong>.“去！你和你从埃及地所领上来的百姓从这里上到那地”表这个民族将要代表教会，但教会不会住在他们中间，因为他们无法从外在事物中被提升。这从“上到那地”和“从埃及地所领上来”的含义清楚可知。“上到那地”是指为了建立教会，因为在圣言中，“地”表示教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）；“上到那地”表示建立教会，因为他们就是为这个目的而被领到或上到的；但在此不是建立教会，仅仅代表它，因为这个民族的兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物，与人同住的教会在与他同在的内在之物中；此处所表示的不是建立教会，仅仅代表构成教会的事物，这一事实解释了为何经上说“去！从这里上去”，又说“你和你从埃及地所领上来的百姓”，因而是摩西，而不是耶和华把他们领上来的；在接下来的经文中，经上说“我就不在你们中间上去，因为你们是硬着颈项的百姓”，意思是说，神性不在他们当中，神性在哪里不从内在被接受，哪里就没有教会，只有代表教会的一个外在。“从埃及地所领上来”是指从外在事物被提升到内在之物，但在此不是被如此提升的，因为经上说领他们上来的是摩西，而不是耶和华。关于“从那地领上来”的这层含义，可参看前文（<a href="10421.htm">10421</a>节）。以色列民族当中没有教会，只有一个教会的代表（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="4311.htm">4311</a>，<a href="4500.htm">4500</a>，<a href="4899.htm">4899</a>，<a href="4912.htm">4912</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="7043.htm">7043</a>，<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>节；以及前一章各处的论述）。</p>

Go, go up from hence, thou and the people which thou hast made to come up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land. That this signifies that this nation is to represent the church, but that no church 
shall be in it, because it cannot be raised from external things, is evident from the signification of "going up unto the land," as being to institute the church, for by "land" or "earth" in the Word 
is signified the church (see at the places cited in n. 9325); and by "going up unto it" is signified to institute the church, because for this reason they were led there, or "went up." But here it does 
not signify to institute the church, but only to represent it, because that nation was in external things without what is internal, and the church with man is in his internal. As in this case it does 
not signify to institute a church, but only to represent those things which are of the church, therefore it is said, "Go, go up from hence, both thou and the people which thou hast made to come up out 
of the land of Egypt," thus which Moses made to come up, but not Jehovah; and in a subsequent verse, "I will not go up in the midst of thee, because thou art a stiff-necked people," by which is signified 
that the Divine is not with them; and where the Divine is not received in the internal, there is not the church, but only an external that is representative of the church. And from the signification 
of "making to come up out of the land of Egypt," as being to be raised from external things to what is internal, but here, not to be raised, because it is said that Moses made them to come up, and 
not that Jehovah did so. That this is signified by "making to come up out of the land of Egypt," see in n. 10421. (That there was not a church with the Israelitish nation, but only the representative 
of a church, see n. 4281, 4288, 4311, 4500, 4899, 4912, 6304, 7043, 9320; and everywhere in the preceding chapter.) </p>

'Go! go up from here, you and the people whom you have caused to come up out of the land of Egypt, to the land' means that this nation will represent the Church, but the Church will not reside among 
them, because they cannot be raised from external things. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up to the land' as in order to establish the Church (for 'the land' in the Word means the Church, see 
in the places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>, and 'going up to it' means establishing it, since it was for that purpose that they were being led or going up towards it), though not establishing the Church, only 
representing it, is meant here because the interest of that nation lay in external things and not in what was internal, and the Church resides with a person in what is internal with him (the fact that 
not establishing the Church, only representing the things that constitute the Church is meant here explains why it says, 'Go! go up from here', and also, 'you and the people whom you have caused to 
come up out of the land of Egypt', thus whom Moses, not Jehovah, caused to come up; and in a subsequent verse, 'I will not go up in your midst, since you are a stiff-necked people', meaning that what 
is Divine is not among them, and where what is Divine is not received inwardly, no Church exists either, only an outward representation of the Church); and from the meaning of 'causing to come up out 
of the land of Egypt' as being raised from external things to what is internal, but here not being so raised since it says that Moses caused them to come up and not that Jehovah did so. For this meaning 
of 'causing to come up out of the land of Egypt', see <a href="10421.htm">10421</a>.  </p>
<p>No Church resided among the Israelite nation, only that which was representative of the Church, see <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>, <a href="4311.htm">4311</a>, <a href="4500.htm">4500</a>, <a href="4899.htm">4899</a>, <a href="4912.htm">4912</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>, <a href="6704.htm">6704</a>, <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>, and wherever it is spoken of in the previous chapter.  </p>

`Vade, ascende abhinc, tu et populus quem ascendere fecisti (x)e terra Aegypti, ad terram':  quod significet quod gens illa repraesentatura sit Ecclesiam, sed non erit apud illam Ecclesia, quia elevari 
ab externis nequit, constat ex significatione `ascendere in terram' quod sit ad instituendum Ecclesiam, nam per `terram' in Verbo significatur Ecclesia, videatur in locis citatis n. (x)9325, et per 
`ascendere ad illam' significatur instituere illam, {1}quoniam ideo ducebantur illuc, seu ascendebant; hic autem non significatur instituere {3}illam, sed solum repraesentare illam, {4}quia gens illa 
in externis absque interno erat, et Ecclesia apud hominem est in interno ejus; {4} quoniam hic non significatur instituere Ecclesiam, sed solum repraesentare illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, ideo dicitur, 
`Vade, ascende abhinc,' et quoque, `tu et populus quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti,' ita quem Moscheh ascendere fecit, et non Jehovah; ac in subsequente versu, `Non ascendam in medio tui, quia populus 
durus cervice tu,' per quae significatur quod (t)non Divinum sit apud illos, et ubi Divinum non recipitur in interno, ibi nec Ecclesia est, est modo externum repraesentativum Ecclesiae; et ex significatione 
`ascendere facere e terra Aegypti' quod sit elevari ab externis ad internum; hic autem non elevari, quia dicitur quod Moscheh illos ascendere fecerit, et non quod Jehovah; quod id per `ascendere 
facere (c)e terra Aegypti' significetur, videatur n. 10421. Quod apud gentem {5}Israeliticam Ecclesia non fuerit sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, videatur n. 4281, 4288, 4311, 4500, 4899,
