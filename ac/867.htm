<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>867.</strong>“飞来飞去”表这就是他们的状态。这一点从居于处在试探后第一和第二状态，也就是说当虚假飞来飞去时的状态期间之人身上的虚假明显可知。前面提到了原因，即这时人只知道，并只能知道事物的最笼统概念。流入这些概念的，是源于肉体、感官和尘世之物的错觉，而它们与信之真理不一致。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]867.</strong> The symbolism of going and coming back as the stage they were in, which fluctuated in just this way, can be seen from the falsities that plague people during the first and second stages after their trials. As false ideas then flit through the mind, they depart and return, for the reason given above: the person can and does learn only the most comprehensive generalizations. These generalizations give entry to some very fanciful notions that arise from a bodily, sensory, and worldly source, and that do not harmonize with the truth taught by faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 867</b></p><p><b>867.</b>
That "going and returning" signifies that such was their state, is evident from the falsities with man while in his first and second state after temptation, namely, that the falsities thus fly about, 
going and returning, for the reason mentioned above, that man at that time is and can be only in the knowledge of the most general things, into which flow phantasies arising from corporeal, sensuous, 
and worldly things, which do not agree with the truths of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 867</b></p><p><b>867.</b>
'Going back and forth' means that such was their state. This is clear from the falsities which reside with a person during the first and second states following temptation, that is to say, when falsities 
are flitting around back and forth. The reason why falsities do so has been given already; in these states a person knows and is capable of knowing only the very general concepts of things. Into 
these concepts flow delusions deriving from things of the body, the senses, and the world, which do not agree with the truths of faith.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 867</b>
</p><b>867.</b>
Quod per 'exire et redire' significetur status earum {1}, qui talis, constat ex falsitatibus quae apud hominem cum in statu primo et secundo post tentationem, quod nempe ita falsa volitent ut exeant 
et redeant, ex causa, de qua prius, quod solum in communissimorum cognitione sit et esse possit, in quae influunt phantasiae ex corporeis, sensualibus, et mundanis, quae non concordant cum veritatibus 
fidei. 	@1 T. alters to eorum, as in 864, but earum may refer to the falsitates of preceding [ ].$ </p>
