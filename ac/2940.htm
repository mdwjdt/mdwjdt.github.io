<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2940节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2940.</strong>“以弗仑正坐在赫人中间”表那些主要能接受信之良善与真理的人。这从“以弗仑”的代表，以及“赫人”和“中间”或“在中间”的含义清楚可知：“赫人”是指那些能接受信之良善与真理的人，新教会能存在于他们身上（参看<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>，<a href="2933.htm">2933</a>节）；“中间”或“在中间”是指主要的，或首要的和至内在的（参看<a href="1074.htm">1074</a>节）。“中间”在内义上表主要的或首要的，以及至内在的，这是缘于来世的代表物。当以属灵的概念来代表良善时，该良善的精华就出现在中间，而次一点、不那么纯粹的良善则相继从中间出现在外围，直到最后出现在周边的是那些并不良善之物。这就是为何“在中间”表主要的或首要的，以及至内在的。思想观念同样以这种方式被代表；情感，以及一切状态的变化也是；良善或邪恶因此根据它们朝向中间的情况而各异。这一切源于属灵和属天之物所具有的形式，这形式就是如此。</p>

Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. That this signifies those by whom the good and truth of faith could primarily be received, is evident from the representation of "Ephron," and also 
from the signification of the "sons of Heth," as being those with whom the truth and good of faith could be received, and with whom there could be a new church (see n. 2913, 2933); and from the signification 
of "the midst" or "in the midst," as being what is primary, or principal, and also inmost (see n. 1074). That "the midst" in the internal sense signifies what is primary or principal, and also 
inmost, is from representatives in the other life; for when any good is represented by spiritual ideas, then what is best is presented in the midst, and what is less and less good is presented successively 
from the middle outward; and lastly at the circumference are those things which are not good; it is from this that "in the midst" denotes both what is primary or principal and what is inmost. 
In this manner likewise are represented the ideas of thought, and also affections, and all changes of state; the goods or evils being thus varied according to their situation in respect to the middle. 
The origin of this is from the form of spiritual and heavenly things, which is such. </p>

'Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth' means those who were primarily able to receive the good and truth of faith. This is clear from the representation of 'Ephron', and also from the 
meaning of 'the sons of Heth' as those with whom the good and truth of faith could be received and with whom a new Church existed, dealt with in <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>, <a href="2933.htm">2933</a>; and from the meaning of 'the middle' or 'in 
the midst' as that which is primary or the chief thing, and also that which is inmost, dealt with in <a href="1074.htm">1074</a>. 'The middle' in the internal sense means that which is primary or the chief thing, and also 
that which is inmost, by reason of the representatives in the next life. When anything good is represented there by means of spiritual ideas, the purest of the good is in the middle and the less and less 
pure in consecutive degrees from the middle, until lastly at the circumference there is that which is not good at all. And this is why 'in the midst' means both that which is primary or the chief 
thing and also that which is inmost. The ideas comprising thought are also represented in the same manner, and so are affections too. And all changes of state are represented in that manner, in that everything 
good or evil is altered as to its position towards the middle. This has its origin in the form possessed by spiritual and celestial things, which is such. </p>

</p><b>2940.</b>
`Ephron sedens in medio filiorum Heth':  quod significet illos a quibus recipi primario bonum et verum fidei posset, constat a repraesentatione `Ephronis,' tum a significatione `filiorum Heth' quod 
sint illi apud quos verum et bonum fidei recipi posset et apud quos nova Ecclesia, de qua n. 2913, 2933; et a significatione `medii' seu in medio quod sit primarium seu principale, {1}tum intimum, de 
qua n. 1074. Quod `medium' in sensu interno significet primarium seu principale, tum intimum, est a repraesentativis in altera vita; cum repraesentatur aliquod bonum per ideas spirituales, tunc optimum 
sistitur in medio, et decrescentiae boni sistuntur a medio per gradus de, et ultimo ad peripheriam illa quae non sunt bona; inde est quod `in medio' sit tam primarium seu principale, quam intimum; ideae 
cogitationis ita quoque repraesentantur, tum etiam affectiones; et omnes status mutationes, ita, quod varientur bona {2}vel mala quoad situm versus medium; ducit hoc originem a forma rerum spiritualium 
et caelestium quae talis. @1 et$  @2 aut$  </p>
