<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第89节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>89.</strong>创世记2:4 这些是天与地的后代，在耶和华神造地与天的日子，乃是这样。<br />所谓“创造天与地的来历”，就是属天之人的创造过程。对于此处所论述的是属天之人的创造过程，这从下文所描述的诸多细节可知，如田间的草本还没有长起来，也没有人耕土，耶和华神用土里的尘埃造人，又造田间各样走兽和空中各样飞鸟，等等。这些在前一章本已作了描述，可见此处所论述的另一人。<br />再者，主在此首次被称为“耶和华神”，而前一章在论述属灵之人时，他只是被称为“神”，这就更加明显了。还有，前一章只提到“地”，此处则还提到了“土”和“田”。而且本节先提“天与地”，随后又提“地与天”，这是因为，“地”象征人的外在，“天”象征人的内在。对于属灵之人，创造是从“地”开始，亦即从外在开始。对于此处所描述的属天之人，创造则是从内在开始，亦即从“天”开始。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]89.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_89/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_4" target=_top>Genesis 2:4</a>. These are the births of the heavens and the earth when he created them, on the day on which he, Jehovah God, made the earth and the heavens.<br />The births of the heavens and the earth are the ways in which the heavenly person is formed.<br />Clearly this verse concerns the formation of a heavenly person. Subsequent details provide additional evidence. The text says, for instance, that no plant had yet sprouted, that there was no human to cultivate the ground, and that Jehovah God formed the human, then every beast and every bird in the heavens. But since the last chapter already told of the formation of these things, the present chapter must be talking about another kind of person.<br />As further evidence, this verse is the first to use the name Jehovah God, where before, in discussing the spiritual person, the text used only God. The current chapter speaks of the ground and the field, the former only of the earth or land. Finally, this verse initially places heaven before earth and then earth before heaven. The reason for this last point is that the earth symbolizes the outer self and heaven the inner self of a spiritual person, and such a person's reformation begins in the earth, or outer self. However, because the subject is now a heavenly person, reformation begins in the inner self, or heaven. </p>

Verse 4. These are the nativities of the heavens and of the earth, when He created them, in the day in which Jehovah God made the earth and the heavens. The "nativities of the heavens and of the earth" 
are the formations of the celestial man. That his formation is here treated of is very evident from all the particulars which follow, as that no herb was as yet growing; that there was no man to till 
the ground, as well as that Jehovah God formed man, and afterwards, that He made every beast and bird of the heavens, notwithstanding that the formation of these had been treated of in the foregoing 
chapter; from all which it is manifest that another man is here treated of. This however is still more evident from the fact, that now for the first time the Lord is called "Jehovah God" whereas in 
the preceding passages, which treat of the spiritual man, He is called simply "God;" and, further, that now "ground" and "field" are mentioned, while in the preceding passages only "earth" is mentioned. 
In this verse also "heaven" is first mentioned before "earth" and afterwards "earth" before "heaven;" the reason of which is that "earth" signifies the external man, and "heaven" the internal, and 
in the spiritual man reformation begins from "earth" that is, from the external man, while in the celestial man, who is here treated of, it begins from the internal man, or from "heaven." </p>

Verse 4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when He created them, on the day in which Jehovah God made the earth and the heavens.  'The generations of the heavens and the earth' are 
stages in the formation of the celestial man. The fact that the formation of that man is now the subject is also quite clear from the details that follow, for example 'no plant had yet sprung up', 
'there was no man to till the ground', then 'Jehovah God formed the man', and after that 'every beast and bird of the air'.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> According to the previous chapter, man, beast, and bird have been formed already, 
which means that a different man is the subject here. This is further evident from the fact that 'Jehovah God' is now mentioned for the first time, whereas previously, when the subject has been 
the spiritual man, He is called simply 'God'. Also 'ground and field' are referred to now, whereas previously it was merely 'the earth'. And in the present verse 'heaven' is first of all mentioned before 
'earth' and then 'earth' before 'heaven'. This is because 'earth' means the external man and 'heaven' the internal. With the spiritual man, in whom reformation is taking place, the starting point 
is the earth or external man; but here, where the subject is celestial man, the starting point is the internal man or heaven.

Vers. 4.  Hae nativitates caelorum et terrae, cum creavit illos, in die quo fecit Jehovah Deus terram et caelos. 'Nativitates caelorum et terrae' sunt formationes hominis caelestis.  Quod de formatione 
ejus nunc agatur, constat manifeste, etiam ex singulis quae sequuntur; ut, quod 'nulla herba adhuc germinaverit'; quod 'nullus homo ad colendum humum'; tum quod 'formaverit Jehovah Deus hominem'; 
dein quod 'omnem bestiam, et avem caelorum'; de quibus tamen formatis in capite praecedente actum est; quare hic de alio homine agitur: quod adhuc patet ex eo quod nunc primum dicatur 'Jehovah Deus'; 
in praecedentibus, ubi de spirituali homine, solum 'Deus'; tum quod nunc dicatur 'humus et ager,' in praecedentibus modo 'terra'; et quod in hoc versu primum praeponatur caelum tertae, et dein terta caelo; 
causa est quia 'terta' significat extemum hominem, et 'caelum' internum, apud spiritualem hominem in quo reformatio, incipit a terta seu externo homine; hic autem ubi de caelesti, incipit ab interno 
homine seu a caelo.
