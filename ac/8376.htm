<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8376节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8376.</strong>木星居民躺在床上时，会脸朝前或看向内室，而不是脸朝后，或对着墙。他们的灵人告诉我这一切，并说明他们这样躺着的原因，即：他们认为这样他们就把脸转向主；而如果朝后看，他们的脸就会转离主。当我躺在床上时，这种事有时也发生在我身上；只是以前我不知道原因。</p>

When the inhabitants of that earth are lying in bed, they turn their face forward, or into the chamber; but not backward, or to the wall. Their spirits told me this, and stated the reason: that they 
believe that in this way they turn their face to the Lord, but if backward, that they would turn it away. A similar thing had sometimes happened to me, when I was in bed, but I had not previously known 
the source of it. </p>

When inhabitants of that planet lie in bed they turn their face frontwards or looking into the room, and not backwards or to the wall. This was told me by their spirits, who said the reason for their 
lying like that is their belief that they thereby turn their face to the Lord, whereas if it were looking backwards they would be turning it away from Him. I   myself had felt a similar urge several 
times while in bed but I had not known the reason for it before then. </p>

</p><b>8376.</b>
Quando incolae telluris illius cubant in lecto, convertunt faciem suam antrorsum, seu in conclave, non autem retrorsum, seu ad parietem; hoc mihi spiritus illorum narrabant, et dicebant causam quod 
credant se faciem sic ad Dominum vertere, si autem retrorsum quod illam averterent; tale mihi aliquoties obvenerat cum essem in lecto, sed unde id, non prius sciveram. </p>
