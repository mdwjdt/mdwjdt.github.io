<p><strong>[NCE]700.</strong> Because there are so many hells, as I said, describing them in an organized way means doing so in this order:<br />1. The hells of those who spent their lives in hatred, revenge, and cruelty [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_700/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814" target=_top>814-823</a>].<br />2. The hells of those who spent their lives in adultery and lechery; in addition, the hells of deceivers and witches [824-831].<br />3. Misers' hells; the foul Jerusalem there and outlaws in the wilderness; in addition, the feces-laden hells of those who have pursued sensual pleasure alone [938-946].<br />4. Next, other hells than these [947-970].<br />5. Last, those who are undergoing spiritual devastation [1106-1113].<br />These may be found at the beginnings and ends of the ensuing chapters. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 700</b></p><p><b>700.</b>
The hells being as we have stated so numerous, in order to give some regular account of them, they shall be treated of as follows -I. Concerning the hells of those who have lived a life of hatred, revenge, 
and cruelty. II. Concerning the hells of those who have lived in adulteries and lasciviousnesses; and concerning the hells of the deceitful, and of sorceresses. III. Concerning the hells of the 
avaricious; and the filthy Jerusalem there, and the robbers in the wilderness; also concerning the excrementitious hells of those who have lived in mere pleasures. IV. Afterwards concerning other hells 
which are distinct from the above. V. Finally concerning those who are in vastation. The description of these will be found prefixed and appended to the following chapters.      </p>
<p>CHAPTER 7.     
 1. And Jehovah said unto Noah, Enter thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.      2. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, 
the man [vir] and his wife; and of the beast that is not clean by twos, the man and his wife.      3. Of the fowl of the heavens also by sevens, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the faces of 
the whole earth.      4. For in yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every substance that I have made will I destroy from off the faces of the ground.  
    5. And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.  * * * * * * * * * *      6. And Noah was a son of six hundred years, and the flood of waters was upon the earth.      7. And Noah 
went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, from before the waters of the flood.      8. Of the clean beast, and of the beast that is not clean, and of the fowl, 
and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,      9. There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.      10. And it came to pass after the seven 
days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. * * * * * * * * * *      11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, in that day 
were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the cataracts of heaven were opened.      12. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. * * * * * * * * * *      13. In the 
self-same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.      14. They, and every wild animal after its 
kind, and every beast after its kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind; and every fowl after its kind, every flying thing, every winged thing.      15. And they 
went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of lives. * * * * * * * * * *      16. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded 
him. And Jehovah shut after him.      17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up from off the earth.      18. And the waters 
were strengthened, and were increased exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. * * * * * * * * * *      19. And the waters were strengthened very exceedingly upon 
the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.      20. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and covered the mountains.      21. And all flesh died that 
creepeth upon the earth, as to fowl, and as to beast, and as to wild animal, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; and every man.      22. All in whose nostrils was the breathing 
[flatus] of the breath of lives, of all that was in the dry [land], died.      23. And He destroyed every substance that was upon the faces of the ground, from man even to beast, even to creeping 
thing, and even to the fowl of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only was left, and that which was with him in the ark.      24. And the waters were strengthened upon the 
earth a hundred and fifty days. </p>

The hells, as stated, being so numerous, let them be spoken about in turn under the following headings:  </p>
<p><a href="1.htm">1</a> The hells of people who have gone through life hating, desiring revenge, and being cruel. <a href="2.htm">2</a> 
The hells of people who have gone through life committing adultery and acts of unrestrained lust; also the hells of deceivers and witches. <a href="3.htm">3</a> The hells of the avaricious, and in the same place, the 
filthy Jerusalem and the robbers in the desert; and also the utterly foul hells of people who have lived wholly engrossed in the pursuit of pleasures. <a href="4.htm">4</a> Then other hells different from these mentioned 
already. <a href="5.htm">5</a> Finally, people who are undergoing vastation.  For these topics see the preliminary or the final sections to the chapters that follow. </p>

<p>	1. ET dixit JEHOVAH Noaho, Intra tu et omnis domus tua in arcam, quia te vidi justum coram Me in generatione hac. 	2. De omni bestia munda accipias tibi septena 
septena, virum et uxorem ejus, et de bestia quae non munda illa, bina, virum et uxorem ejus. 	3. Etiam de ave caelorum septena septena, masculum et feminam; ad vivificandum semen super faciebus totius 
terrae. 	4. Quia ad dies adhuc septem Ego pluere faciens super terram, quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes, et delebo omnem substantiam, quam feci, a super faciebus humi. 	5. Et fecit Noah secundum 
omne, quod praecepit ei JEHOVAH.                         *     *     * 	6. Et Noah filius sexcentorum annorum, et diluvium factum aquarum super terra. 	7. Et intravit Noah, et filii ejus, et 
uxor ejus, et uxores filiorum ejus cum illo, in arcam, a coram aquis diluvii. 	8. De bestia munda, et de bestia quae non ea munda, et de avi, et omni quod repit super humo. 	9. Bina bina intrarunt ad 
Noahum in arcam, masculus et femina, quemadmodum praeceperat DEUS Noaho. 	10. Et erat ad septem dies, et aquae diluvii erant super terra.                        *     *     * 	11. In anno sexcentesimo 
anni vitae Noahi, in mense secundo, septimo decimo die mensis, in die hoc disrupti sunt omnes fontes abyssi magnae, et cataractae caeli apertae. 	12. Et fuit imber super terra quadraginta diebus 
et quadraginta noctibus. 	13.  In ipso die hoc intravit Noah, et Shem, et Ham et Japheth, filii Noahi, et uxor Noahi, et tres uxores filiorum ejus cum illis, in arcam. 	14.  Illi, et omnis fera secundum
