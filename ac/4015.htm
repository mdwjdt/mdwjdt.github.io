<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4015.</strong>“将皮剥成白纹，使枝子露出白的来”表由真理的内在能力所产生的排序。这从“剥皮”和“剥”，以及“白”和“枝子”的含义清楚可知：“剥皮”（stripping）和“剥”（strips）是指剥掉外在真理，以便让内在真理露出来，因而如同裸露或剥皮；“白”是指真理（<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>节）；“枝子”（rod，即杖或棍）是指能力（<a href="4013.htm">4013</a>节），在此是指内在能力，因为枝子在树皮下面。由真理的内在能力所产生的排序是指内层人作用于外层人，也就是属灵人作用于属世人的能力。属世人里面的良善与真理的一切排序皆出自属灵人，也就是从主经由属灵人，事实上经由那里的真理而来。因为主流入属灵人或内层人的良善；并且是经由那里的真理流入属世人。但主并非直接经由良善流入属世人，除非这人已经重生。因此，属世人里面的一切排序，都是由内层人产生的。属世层，即属世人绝无可能以其它任何方式被排序，也就是重生。<br />这种排序是由内层人产生的，这一事实从人对真理的承认明显可知。除非内层人作出这种承认，否则它就不是承认；除非良知也作出这种承认，就是由内层人，以及觉察所作出的对真理的承认，否则它不是承认。由于这种排序是由内层人通过真理产生的，故能力被归于真理，并被归于表示能力的“杖”，以及也表示能力的“手”（<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>节）；这一点从圣言中的许多经文可以得到证实。不是说真理凭自己拥有能力，拥有能力的是良善，因而是出自良善的真理，也就是从主经由良善而来的真理。这在某种程度上说明由真理的内在能力所产生的排序是什么意思。就论述主的至高意义而言，所表示的是祂自己的能力；事实上，神性拥有自己的能力，因为这能力并非出自其他人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4015</b></p><p><b>4015.</b>
And peeled white peelings on them, laying bare the white that was upon the rods. That this signifies a disposition into order by the interior power of truth, is evident from the signification of "peeling" 
and of "peelings," as being the removal of exterior things in order that interior ones may come to light, thus barings or strippings; from the signification of "white," as being truth (see n. 3993, 
4007); and from the signification of a "rod," as being power (see n. 4013); here, interior power, because upon the rods under the bark. Disposition into order by the interior power of truth, is the 
power of the interior man acting into the exterior, or of the spiritual man into the natural; for all disposition into order of the good and truth in the natural man comes from the spiritual man (that 
is, through the spiritual man from the Lord), and in fact through the truth therein; for the Lord inflows into the good of the spiritual or interior man; and through the truth therein into the natural 
man; but not immediately through the good, until the man has been regenerated; and therefore all the disposition into order in the natural man is effected by the interior man. The natural, or natural 
man, cannot possibly be disposed into order (that is, be regenerated) in any other way. That this is done by the interior man is evident from the acknowledgment of truth, which unless it is made by 
the interior man is not acknowledgment; and also from conscience, which is the acknowledgment of truth by the interior man; and also from perception. As disposition into order is effected by the interior 
man by means of truth, power is predicated of truth, and also the "rod" by which power is signified; as well as the "hand," by which also power is signified (n. 3091); as may be confirmed by very 
many passages in the Word. Not that there is power in truth from itself, but in good; and thus in truth from good; that is, in truth through good from the Lord. This shows to some extent what is meant 
by the disposition into order of the interior power of truth. In the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of, His own power is signified; for the Divine has its own power, because this is from 
no other. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4015</b></p><p><b>4015.</b>
'And he stripped white strips on them - an exposing of the white which was on the rods' means an ordering effected by the interior power of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'stripping' and of 
'strips' as peelings away of the exterior parts so that the interior may be laid bare, and so as exposings; from the meaning of 'while' as truth, dealt with above in <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4007.htm">4007</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'a rod' as power, dealt with just above in <a href="4013.htm">4013</a>, in this case an interior power because the surface of the rods beneath their outer covering is meant. By an ordering effected by the interior power 
of truth is meant the power of the interior man acting on the exterior man, that is, of the spiritual man acting on the natural man. For all ordering of good and truth within the natural man comes from 
the spiritual man, that is, it comes from the Lord by way of the spiritual man - by way of the truth there. For the Lord flows into the good of the spiritual or interior man; and through the truth there 
He flows into the natural man. But He does not flow in directly by way of good into the natural until the person has been regenerated. All ordering within the natural man therefore is effected by 
the interior man. The natural - that is, the natural man - cannot possibly be ordered, that is, regenerated, in any other way. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that this ordering is effected by the interior man is evident 
from a person's acknowledgement of truth. Unless this acknowledgement is made by the interior man it is not acknowledgement; nor is it so unless it is made by conscience too, which is the acknowledgement 
by the interior man, and also by perception. Because the ordering by the interior man is effected by means of truth, power is therefore attributed to truth, as it is also to a rod, by which 
power is meant, as well as to the hand, by which likewise power is meant, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, as may be substantiated from very many places in the Word. Not that the power which truth possesses is from that truth but 
from good; and so it is truth empowered by good, that is, by the Lord through good This shows to some extent what is meant by an ordering effected by the interior power of truth. In the highest sense, 
where the Lord is the subject, His own power is meant, for the power which the Divine has is His own power since it does not come from another. </p>

`Et decorticavit in illis decorticationes albas, denudationem albi, quod super baculis': quod significet dispositionem veri interiori potentiae, constat ex significatione `decorticare' et `decorticationum' 
quod sint detractiones exteriorum, ut pateant interiora, ita denudationes; a significatione `albi' quod sit verum, de qua supra n. 3993, 4007; </p>
<p>et a significatione `baculi' quod sit potentia, 
de qua mox supra n. 4013, hic potentia interior quia `super baculis sub cortice' dispositio veri interioris potentiae, est potentia interioris hominis in exteriorem, seu spiritualis hominis in 
naturalem; omnis enim dispositio boni et veri in naturali homine venit a spirituali homine, hoc est, per spiritualem hominem a Domino, et quidem per verum ibi; influit enim Dominus in {1}spiritualis 
seu interioris hominis bonum, et per verum ibi in naturalem, non autem per bonum immediate priusquam homo regeneratus est; quare omnis dispositio in naturali homine fit ab interiore; naturale seu 
naturalis homo nusquam aliter disponi potest, hoc est, regenerari; [2] quod ab interiore, patet ex agnitione ver quae nisi sit ab interiore, non est agnitio, tum quoque a conscientia quae est agnitio 
veri ab interiore, et quoque a perceptione; quia dispositio ab interiore fit per verum, ideo de vero praedicatur potentia {2}tum quoque baculus per quem potentia significatur, {3}ut et manus per 
quam etiam significatur potentia, n. 3091, ut a perpluribus locis in Verbo, confirmari potest; non quod vero insit potentia a se sed bono, et sic vero ex bono, hoc est, vero per bonum a Domino; 
inde aliquantum constare potest quid sit dispositio veri interioris potentiae.  In supremo sensu, in quo agitur de Domino, significatur potentia propria, nam Divino est potentia propria, quia non ab alio. @1
