<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4448节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4448.</strong>“我的儿子示剑”表源于这良善的真理。这从“示剑”的代表清楚可知，“示剑”是指内层真理（参看<a href="4430.htm">4430</a>节），因而是指源于哈抹所表良善的真理（<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）。事实上，教会的一切真理源于它的良善；这类真理从不来自任何其它源头。此处由示剑所代表的这真理被称为内层真理，本质上无非是仁之良善。上古教会因是属天的，故处于对主之爱的良善，由此处于对一切真理的觉知；因为该教会成员几乎和天使一样，并与他们交流，其觉知便出自这种交流。因此，他们从不推理任何信之真理，只是简单地说“是的，这就是真理”，因为他们从天堂拥有对真理的觉知。他们甚至不愿提及信，只愿提及仁以取代之（参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>节）。正因如此，“内层真理”在此是指仁之良善。至于该教会存在于希未人哈抹和他儿子示剑当中的余留，可参看上一节（<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）。<br />属灵的古教会的情形则不同，因为古教会不像上古教会那样处于对主之爱，而是处于对邻之仁。它若不通过信之真理，就无法到达仁爱；他们也不像上古教会的人那样拥有任何觉知，于是便开始调查真理是不是真理。关于拥有觉知的属天之人和没有觉知的属灵之人之间的区别，可参看前文（<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="3235.htm">3235</a>，<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3887.htm">3887</a>节）。</p>

Shechem my son. That this signifies the truth thence derived, is evident from the representation of Shechem, as being interior truth (see n. 4430), thus the truth thence derived, namely, from the good 
which is "Hamor" (n. 4447); for all the truth of the church is from its good, and from no other source does this truth ever come forth. This truth, here represented by Shechem, is called interior truth, 
and in its essence is nothing else than the good of charity. For the Most Ancient Church, being celestial, was in the good of love to the Lord, and thence in the perception of all truth, because 
the men of that church were almost like angels, and had communication with them, from which came their perception, and therefore they never reasoned about any truth of faith, but said "It is so," because 
they perceived it from heaven, insomuch that they were not willing even to mention faith, but in its stead charity (see n. 202, 337, 2715, 2718, 3246), and this is the reason why by "interior truth" 
is here meant the good of charity. That there were remains of the church in question with Hamor the Hivite and his son Shechem, was shown just above (n. 4447). [2] The case was different with the 
Ancient Church which was spiritual, for this church was not in love to the Lord, as was the Most Ancient Church, but was in charity toward the neighbor; and they could not attain to charity except through 
the truth of faith, of which they had no perception, like the most ancient people, and therefore they then began to make an investigation about truth to see whether it is so. (As to the difference 
between the celestial who had perception, and the spiritual who have it not, see n. 2088, 2669, 2708, 2715, 3235, 3240, 3246, 3887.) </p>

'Shechem my son' means the truth derived from that good. This is clear from the representation of 'Shechem' as interior truth, dealt with in <a href="4430.htm">4430</a>, and so truth derived from the good meant by Hamor, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. 
Actually all the truth of the Church is derived from its good; such truth never arises from any other source. This truth which Shechem represents is called interior truth, being in essence nothing 
other than the good of charity. Indeed the Most Ancient Church, being celestial, was governed by the good of love to the Lord and as a consequence they had a perception of all truth; for the members 
of that Church were almost as angels. They also had communication with angels, that being the source of their perception. They never therefore reasoned about any truth of faith, but simply said 'Yes, 
that is the truth' because they had a perception of it from heaven. They did not even wish to make mention of faith, but of charity instead, see <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>. For this reason it is the 
good of charity that is meant at this point by interior truth. As regards the remnants of that Church existing with Hamor the Hivite and his son Shechem, see immediately above in <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. </p>

 With the 
Ancient Church, which was spiritual, it was different. This Church was not governed like the Most Ancient Church by love to the Lord but by charity towards the neighbour. Nor was it able to arrive at 
charity except through the truth of faith, of which, unlike the Most Ancient people, they did not have any perception and therefore began to make investigations into whether the truth was the truth. 
Regarding the difference between celestial people who had perception and spiritual ones who do not, see <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="3235.htm">3235</a>, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3887.htm">3887</a>. </p>

`Shechem filius meus':  quod significet verum inde, constat ex repraesentatione `Shechemi' quod sit verum interius, de qua n. 4430, ita verum inde, nempe ex bono quod est Hamor, n. 4447; omne enim 
verum Ecclesiae est a bono ejus, aliunde nusquam verum existit: hoc verum quod per `Shechemum' repraesentatur, vocatur verum interius, estque in sua essentia non aliud quam bonum charitatis; Antiquissima 
enim Ecclesia quia caelestis, in bono amoris in Dominum fuit ac inde in perceptione omnis veri, nam homines illius Ecclesiae paene sicut angeli fuerunt; communicabant etiam cum illis, inde 
eorum perceptio; quapropter nec usquam ratiocinabantur de aliquo vero fidei, sed dicebant quia percipiebant e caelo, quod ita sit; `et' hoc usque adeo ut ne quidem nominare voluerint fidem, sed loco 
ejus charitatem, `videatur' n. 202, 337, 2715, 2718, 3246; inde est quod per verum interius hic intelligatur bonum charitatis; quod apud Hamorem Hivaeum et filium ejus Shechemum fuerint reliquiae 
illius Ecclesiae, videatur mox supra n. 4447.  [2] Aliter se {1} habuit cum Ecclesia Antiqua, quae spiritualis; haec non in amore in Dominum fuit sicut Ecclesia Antiquissima, sed in charitate erga proximum, 
et ad {2} charitatem non pervenire potuerunt quam per verum fidei, cujus nullam perceptionem habuerant sicut antiquissimi, ideo tunc inceptum fuit disquirere de vero num ita sit.  "De differentia 
inter caelestes qua perceptionem habuerunt et inter spirituales qui non habent, videatur n. 2088, 2669, 2708, 2715, 3235, 3240, 3246, 3887.      @1 i vero$      @2 hanc$ </p>
