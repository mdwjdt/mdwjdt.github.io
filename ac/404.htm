<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第404节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>404.</strong>创世记4:18 以诺生以拿；以拿生米户雅利；米户雅利生玛土撒利；玛土撒利生拉麦。<br />所有这些名字都表异端，它们源于被称为“该隐”的第一个异端，但由于它们除了名字外，没有现存的东西，所以没必要对它们说些什么。通过推导这些名称，或许能收集一些信息，例如，“以拿”的意思是“沿城往下走”，也就是沿着被称为“以诺”的异端往下走等等。</p>

And Irad was born to Enoch. And Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.<br />All these names symbolize heresies stemming from the first one, called Cain. Since we know nothing about them but their names, there is no need to say anything.<br />The derivation of their names, however, yields a measure of information. Irad's name, for instance, signifies that he descends from a city{*1} and so from the heresy called Enoch; and so on.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In a note at this point in his translation (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999; 1:143), Elliott observes that the actual meaning of the name Irad (עִירָד [‘îrāḏ]) is unclear and that the definition Swedenborg gives here is apparently based on a combination of the noun עִיר (‘îr), which means "a city," with יָרַד (yāraḏ), which means "to go down." [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 404</b></p><p><b>404.</b>
Verse 18. And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begat Mehujael, and Mehujael begat Methusael, and Methusael begat Lamech. All these names signify heresies derived from the first, which was called "Cain;" 
but as there is nothing extant respecting them, except the names, it is unnecessary to say anything about them. Something might be gathered from the derivations of the names; for example, "Irad" 
means that he "descends from a city" thus from the heresy called "Enoch" and so on. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 404</b></p><p><b>404.</b>
Verse 18 And to Enoch was born Irad. And Irad beget Mehujael, and Mehujael beget Methushael, and Methushael beget Lamech.  </p>
<p>All these names mean heresies which descended from the first of them, which 
was called 'Cain'. But because nothing more is now extant than just the names of them there is no need to say anything further. Something could possibly be deduced from the derivations of the names 
- Irad, for example, means, He-goes-down-from-the-city,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that is, from the heresy called Enoch,and so on.  
</OL>
<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> Hebrew scholars today are uncertain of the meaning of the name "Irad." The definition given 
here is arrived at by combining the noun 'ir which means a "city" with yaradh which means "to go down."

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 404</b>
</p><b>404.</b>
Vers. 18.  Et natus Hanocho, Iradum {1} ; et Irad genuit Mehujael, et Mehujael genuit Methushael, et Methushael genuit Lamech. Omnia haec nomina significant haereses, ex prima quae 'Cain' vocata est, 
derivatas; et quia de iis nihil praeter nomina exstat, non opus est aliquid dicere: ex nominum derivationibus aliquid tradi posset, sicut quid 'Irad' significat, quod ex urbe descendat, ita ex haeresi 
Hanochus vocata, et sic porro. @	1 This follows Heb. construction, which has ('eth-'iradh) (accus. with passive verb).$ </p>
