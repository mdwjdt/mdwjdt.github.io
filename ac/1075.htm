<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1075节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1075.</strong>创世记9:22 迦南的父亲含，看见他父亲赤身，就告诉他外边的两个兄弟。<br />此处“含”和“迦南”的意思与前面一样：“含”表败坏的教会，“迦南”表脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜。“看见他父亲赤身”表他发现上面所提到的错误和堕落。“就告诉他外边的两个兄弟”表他嘲讽。他们被称为“他的兄弟”，是因为他标榜信。</p>

And Ham, father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and pointed it out to his two brothers outside.<br />Ham and Canaan have the same symbolism here as before; Ham symbolizes the church corrupted, while Canaan symbolizes an outward show of worship without inward content. He saw his father's nakedness means that they observed the errors and perversions mentioned above. And pointed it out to his two brothers outside means that they sneered at those things. The two are called his brothers because these people claimed to have faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1075</b></p><p><b>1075.</b>
Verse 22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. "Ham" and "Canaan" have the same signification here as before; "Ham" the church corrupted; 
"Canaan" worship in externals without internal worship; "saw the nakedness of his father" signifies that he observed the errors and perversions mentioned above; "and told his two brethren without" signifies 
that he derided. They are called his "brethren" because he professed faith. </p>

Verse 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and pointed it out to his two brothers outside.  </p>
<p>'Ham' and 'Canaan' have the same meaning here as previously - 'Ham' the corrupted 
Church, 'Canaan' worship in external things devoid of internal. 'He saw his father's nakedness' means that he noticed the errors and perversities mentioned already. 'And he pointed it out to his two 
brothers outside' means that he mocked. They are called 'his brothers' because he professed faith. </p>

</p><b>1075.</b>
Vers. 22.  Et vidit Ham, pater Canaanis, nuditatem patris sui, et indicavit duobus fratribus suis foris. 'Ham et Canaan' significat hic ut prius, 'Ham' Ecclesiam corruptam, 'Canaan' cultum in externis 
absque interno: 'vidit nuditatem patris sui' significat quod observaverit errores et perversa illa, de quibus prius: 'et indicavit duobus fratribus suis foris' significat quod irriserit; 'fratres ejus' 
dicuntur, quia fidem professus. </p>
