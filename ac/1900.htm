<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1900节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1900.</strong>“你来和我的婢女同房”表与外层人联结。这同样从前面所述清楚可知，即人类理性是由如同父亲的内在人和如同母亲的外层人孕育和生出的。人的真生命来自内在人，在属于记忆的接受器皿通过认知和知识形成之前，这内在人只能与外在人进行最模糊的交流。<br />内在人的流注进入外层人的知识和认知，而情感则是途径。同时，在这些知识存在之前，有一种交流的确存在，但唯独经由主宰外在人的情感存在。不过，由此只存在最一般的活动和某些欲望，以及诸如婴幼儿所表现出的某些盲目的倾向。但这种生命会随着记忆的器皿通过知识形成、内部记忆的器皿通过理性形成而逐渐变得清晰。由于这些器皿被形成并排列为一种序列，事实上，在这样的序列中，它们彼此相互关联，比较象血缘关系和姻亲关系，或社群和家族，所以外在人与内在人的对应关系得以完善，通过介于中间的理性则更加完善。<br />然而，若借以形成这些器皿的认知并非真理，那么仍就缺乏一致性。因为内在人的属天和属灵之物只在真理中为自己寻求对应性，这些真理构成这两种记忆（内部记忆和外部记忆）的有机形体，是适合引入爱的属天事物和信的属灵事物的真正器皿。因为当这些事物被如此引入时，主会照着天堂或其国度的模式和形像排列它们，以使此人成为微型天堂或主的国度，如那些具有爱的属天事物和信的属灵事物之人的心智在圣言中被称呼的那样。不过，这些事是说给那些喜欢深入思考之人的。</p>

Go in I pray unto my handmaid. That this signifies conjunction with the exterior man, is also evident from what has been said before, namely, that man's rational is conceived and born of the internal 
man as a father, and of the exterior man as a mother. Man's very life is from the internal man, which cannot have communication with the external, except a most obscure communication, until the receiving 
vessels that are of the memory have been formed, which is effected by means of knowledges [cognitiones et scientiae].  [2] The influx of the internal man goes into the knowledges of the exterior 
man; affection being the means. Meanwhile, before there are these knowledges, there is indeed a communication, but through affections alone, by which the external man is governed; but from this there 
exist only the most general motions, and certain appetites, also certain blind inclinations, such as show themselves in infants. But this life becomes by degrees more distinct in proportion as the vessels 
of the memory are formed by means of knowledges, and the vessels of the interior memory by means of rational things. As these vessels are formed, and are arranged in series-and indeed in such series 
that they mutually regard each other, comparatively like relationships by blood and by marriage, or like societies and families-thereby is perfected the correspondence of the external man with the 
internal, and still better is this done by means of rational things, which are intermediate.  [3] But still there is a want of congruity unless the knowledges by which the vessels are formed are truths; 
for the celestial and spiritual things of the internal man find no correspondence for themselves except in truths. These are the genuine vessels in the organic forms of each memory, and to which 
the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith can be fitted in; for they are there arranged by the Lord according to the idea and image of the societies of heaven, or of His kingdom, 
insomuch that the man becomes, in least form, a heaven, or a kingdom of the Lord, as also the minds of those who are in the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith are called in the 
Word. But these things have been said for those who love to think more deeply. </p>

'Go in now to my servant-girl' means a joining to the more exterior man. This too is clear from what has been stated already - that the rational part of man's mind is conceived and begotten from the 
internal man as its father and from the exterior as its mother. Man's very life springs from the internal man, which cannot have any communication with the external, other than a very obscure communication, 
until the formation of recipient vessels belonging to the memory has been effected by means of cognitions and knowledge. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The influx of the internal man occurs as an influx into the cognitions 
and factual knowledge that are present in the exterior man - affection being the means. Meanwhile, before they are present, a communication does indeed exist, but solely through those affections 
that control the external man; so that not more than very general stirrings and certain appetites occur there, and also certain blind inclinations such as reveal themselves in small children. But this 
life grows by degrees more definite as vessels are formed in the memory by means of cognitions and in the inner memory by rational concepts. As these vessels are formed and arranged into a sequence 
- into such a sequence in fact that they stand mutually related to one another like blood relatives and relatives by marriage, or like communities and families - so the correspondence is perfected of 
the external man with the internal man, and even better so through rational concepts, which are intermediate. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But if the cognitions by means of which those vessels are formed are not truths, a 
lack of congruity still exists, for the celestial and spiritual things belonging to the internal man do not discover any correspondence for themselves except within truths. Such truths constituting the 
organic fortes of the two memories<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> are the genuine vessels into which the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith may be introduced fittingly; for when they are so introduced they 
are arranged by the Lord according to the pattern and image of the communities of heaven, that is, of the Lord's kingdom - insomuch that the person becomes, in miniature, heaven or the Lord's kingdom, 
as also in the Word the minds of those people are called in whom the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith are present. But these matters have been stated for the benefit of those 
minds that like to go more deeply.

`Ingredere quaeso ad ancillam meam': quod significet conjunctionem cum exteriore, constat quoque ab illis quae prius dicta, quod nempe rationale hominis concipiatur et gignatur ab interno homine ut 
patre et ab exteriore ut matre; ipsa vita hominis est ab interno homine, qui non communicationem habere potest cum externo nisi obscurissimam priusquam formata sunt vasa recipientia quae sunt memoriae, 
quod fit per cognitiones et scientias; [2] influxus interni hominis est in cognitiones et scientifica exterioris, media affectione; antequam haec sunt, interea quidem est communicatio, sed per solas 
affectiones per quas regitur externus, inde modo communissimi motus et quidam appetitus, tum {1} quaedam caecae inclinationes quales apparent apud infantes: sed vita haec fit per gradus distinctior, 
sicut formantur vasa memoriae per cognitiones et vasa interioris memoriae per rationalia; sicuti haec vasa formantur et in serie disponuntur, et quidem in tali ut se mutuo spectent respective sicut consanguinitates 
et affinitates seu sicut societates et familiae, ita perficitur correspondentia externi hominis cum interno; et adhuc melius per rationalia, quae intermedia sunt; [3] sed usque non congruenter 
nisi cognitiones per quas illa formantur, sint veritates; interni enim hominis caelestia et spiritualia non correspondentiam sibi inveniunt nisi in veritatibus; hae in organicis utriusque memoriae 
formis sunt genuina vasa quibus caelestia amoris et spiritualibus fidei possunt inaptari: tunc enim disponuntur a Domino secundum ideam et imaginem societatum caeli seu regni Ipsius, adeo ut fiat 
homo in exigua forma caelum seu regnum Domini, ut quoque mentes illorum qui in caelestibus amoris et spiritualibus fidei sunt, in Verbo appellantur: sed haec dicta sunt illis qui profundius cogitare amant. </p>
