<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1002节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1002.</strong>“不可吃”表不可混在一起。这从前面所述可推知。就本身而言，吃动物的肉是一种亵渎行为，因为上古时代的人从不吃任何畜类或鸟类的肉，纯以五谷为食，尤其是小麦面包、水果、蔬菜、奶及诸如黄油之类的奶制品。在他们看来，杀生食肉极其可憎，类似于野兽的行为。他们只从这些生物身上取得服务和功用，这一点从创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.29.htm">1:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.30.htm">30</a>）清楚看出来。但随着时间推移，当人类开始变得如野兽般残忍，甚至有过之而无不及时，他们第一次开始屠宰动物，取其肉食。人心堕落至此，食肉遂为神所允许，直至今日。只要他凭良知行事，那么这对他来说就是合法的，因为他的良知是由他认为正确且合法的一切形成的。所以，如今没人因为吃肉而受到谴责。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1002.</strong> The symbolism of not eating as not mingling now follows.<br />Regarded in itself, eating meat is a profane custom, since people of the very earliest times never ate the flesh of any animal or bird but only grains (particularly wheat bread), fruit, vegetables, different kinds of milk, and milk products (such as butter). Butchering living creatures and eating the flesh was heinous, in their eyes, and characteristic of wild beasts. It was only on account of the menial labor and the functions the animals performed for them that they captured any. This can be seen from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1002/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_29-30" target=_top>Genesis 1:29-30</a>.{*1} But when time passed and people turned as savage as wild animals and in fact more savage, for the first time they started to butcher animals and eat the meat. In view of the fact that people were like this, the practice was also tolerated, as it still is today. To the extent that people follow it in good conscience, it is permissible, because everything we consider true and consequently allowable forms our conscience. For this reason, no one these days is ever condemned for eating meat.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1002/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_29-30" target=_top>Genesis 1:29-30</a> describes vegetation as the food assigned by God to people and animals. It is only after the Flood that God explicitly gives permission to eat animals (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1002/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_3" target=_top>Genesis 9:3</a>). Swedenborg takes this to mean that people were vegetarians in the antediluvian era. [LHC, RS] </p>

Shall ye not eat. That this signifies not to mingle together, follows from what has just been said. Eating the flesh of animals, regarded in itself, is something profane, for in the most ancient time 
they never ate the flesh of any beast or bird, but only seeds, especially bread made from wheat, also the fruit of trees, vegetables, various milks and what was made from them, such as various butters. 
To kill animals and eat their flesh was to them a wickedness, and like wild beasts. They took from them only service and use, as is evident from Genesis 1:29-30. But in process of time, when men began 
to be as fierce as wild beasts, and even fiercer, they then for the first time began to kill animals and eat their flesh; and because such was man's nature, it was permitted him to do this, and is 
still permitted, to this day; and so far as he does it from conscience, so far it is lawful for him, since his conscience is formed of all that he supposes to be true and thus lawful. No one therefore 
is at this day condemned because of eating flesh. </p>

'Not eating' means not mixing together. This follows from what has been said above. Regarded in itself eating animal flesh is something profane, for in most ancient times people never ate the flesh of 
any beast or bird, but only different kinds of grain, especially wheaten bread, also the fruit of trees, vegetables, milk, and milk products such as butter. Slaughtering living creatures and eating 
their flesh was to them abominable, akin to the behaviour of wild animals. Service and use alone was demanded of those creatures, as is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%201:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 1:29, 30</a>. But in the process of time when mankind 
began to be as savage as wild animals, indeed more savage, they first began to slaughter living creatures and eat their flesh. And because man had become such, he was permitted to do so and is still 
permitted today. And insofar as he does so from conscience, it is quite legitimate, for his conscience is given form from all those things he presumes to be true and so legitimate. Consequently nobody 
nowadays stands in any sense condemned because he eats meat. </p>

</p><b>1002.</b>
'Non comedere': quod significet non commiscere, inde nunc sequitur: comedere carnes animalium in se spectatum, est pro fanum quid, nam antiquissimo tempore nusquam comederunt alicujus bestiae aut avis 
carnem, sed solum semina, cumprimis panes ex tritico, tum fructus arborum, olera, lactes et quae ex lactibus, ut butyra mactare animalia et comedere carnes eorum, iis nefas fuit, et simile ferarum, 
solum ex iis servitia et usus captarunt, ut quoque constat ex Gen. i 29, 30; sed successu temporis cum homo incepit similiter ferox esse ac fera, immo ferocior, tunc primum coeperunt mactare animalia 
et carnes eorum comedere; et quia homo talis, etiam permissum erat, et hodie quoque permittitur; et quantum id facit ex conscientia tantum est licitum, nam conscientia ejus formatur ex omnibus illis 
quae vera putat, ita quae licita; quare etiam hodie nusquam aliquis condemnatur ex eo quod carnem comedat. </p>
