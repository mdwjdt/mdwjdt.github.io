<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7361节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7361.</strong>我通过与他们当中的一些人交谈得知，我们地球上的上古之人的言语也是这样（对此，参看<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="608.htm">608</a>节）。为使这个问题更清楚，我来讲讲我蒙允许通过经历所知道的关于我们地球上的上古之人的言语，即：我通过一种无法描述的流注被指示，那些属于上古教会的人使用哪种类型的言语。它不像我们这个时代的有声语言那样是清晰发声的，而是静默、听不见的，是通过内呼吸而非外呼吸产生的；我还被允许查明其内呼吸的性质。当他们说话时，它从肚脐来到心脏，由此经过唇部，无需任何声音。它不是经由外在途径，敲击所谓的耳鼓进入别人的耳朵，而是经由一种内在途径，事实上经由那里现被称为咽鼓管的途径进入。<br />我被指示，他们通过这种说话方式表达心灵感觉和思维观念，远远比通过清晰的声音或口头的言语所能表达得充分得多，这同样靠呼吸来调节；不过，这呼吸是外在的。因为没有一句话，甚至没有一句话的任何部分不是靠呼吸来调节的。但对这些上古教会的人来说，它是以一种更加完美得多的方式实现的，因为它是通过内呼吸完成的；而内呼吸因更内在，故也更完美、更适合并适用于实际的思维观念。此外，他们还通过唇部的轻微动作和面部表情的相应变化来表达自己。事实上，由于他们是属天人，所以，凡他们所想的，都从他们脸上和眼睛里闪耀出来。它们会发生相应的变化；因此，他们的脸形和表现在脸上的生命会发生改变，在他们眼里所看见的光也会发生变化。他们绝无法表现出与他们所想的不一致的面部表情。在他们看来，伪装，尤其是欺骗，简直是骇人听闻的罪行（<a href="1118.htm">1118</a>节）。由于他们的言语具有这种性质，并且他们拥有内呼吸，所以他们能与天使生活在一起。</p>

That such also was the speech of the most ancient people on this earth, has been given to me to know by conversation with some of them (see n. 607, 608). To make the matter clearer, I may again relate 
what has been given to me to know from experience about the speech of the most ancient of this earth; as follows. "There was shown me by a certain influx which I cannot describe, what was the nature 
of the speech of those who were of the Most Ancient Church, namely, that it was not articulate, like the vocal speech of our time, but tacit; and was produced not by external but by internal respiration. 
It was also granted me to notice the nature of their internal respiration, that it advanced from the navel toward the heart, and so through the lips, without sound, when they spoke; and that it did 
not enter into the ear of another by an external way, and strike upon what is called the drum of the ear; but by a certain internal way, and in fact by a way there which is now called the Eustachian 
tube.  [2] It was shown me that by such speech they could much more fully express the sentiments of the mind and the ideas of thought, than can possibly be done by articulate sounds or sonorous words, 
which likewise are directed by the respiration, but external; for there is no vocal word, nor anything in a vocal word, which is not directed by applications of the respiration. But with them this 
is done much more perfectly, because by internal respiration, which, being more interior, is also more perfect, and more applicable and conformable to the very ideas of thought. Moreover, they express 
themselves by slight movements of the lips, and corresponding changes of the face; for as they had been celestial men, whatever they thought shone forth from their faces and eyes, which were varied 
conformably; the face as to form and life, the eyes as to light. They could not possibly put on an expression of countenance that was not in agreement with what they were thinking. Simulation, and still 
more deceit, were to them a monstrous crime (n. 1118). As their speech was of this nature, and they had internal respiration, they could be in company with angels. </p>

I have also been allowed to know about the existence of this kind of speech among the most ancient people on our planet through my mixing with some of them, regarding which see <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="608.htm">608</a>. To make this 
matter clearer let me repeat what I have been allowed to know through experience about the speech of the most ancient people belonging to our planet, namely the following told in <a href="1118.htm">1118</a>. By means of a 
certain influx that I am unable to describe I have been shown the type of speech which those people who belonged to the Most Ancient Church employed. It was not articulated, like the vocal speech of our 
own times, but was non-audible, produced not by external breathing but by means of internal breathing. I have also been allowed to ascertain the nature of their internal breathing. It came from between 
the navel and the heart and so through the lips without any sounds when they were speaking.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It did not enter someone else's ear by an external route, striking what is called the ear-drum, 
but by a certain internal route, and in point of fact by that part there which is nowadays called the Eustachian tube. I have been shown that by means of this type of speech they were able to express 
far more fully the feelings present in the mind (animus) and the ideas comprising their thought (cogitatio) than can possibly be done by articulated sounds or spoken words, which are similarly delivered 
by means of breath, which however is external. For not one word nor even any part of a word is delivered without the use of breath. But with those people of the Most Ancient Church it was delivered 
in a far more perfect way because it was done by means of internal breathing. And because this interior breathing is also far more perfect, it is more applicable and appropriate to the actual ideas 
comprising thought. In addition they even communicated by movements of the lips and by corresponding changes of facial expression. For, being celestial people, whatever they were thinking shone out of 
their face and eyes which altered correspondingly; the shape of their face and the life expressed in it would alter, and the light seen in their eyes would change. They were quite incapable of assuming 
facial expressions that did not accord with what they were thinking. Pretence, and still more deception, was to them something absolutely outrageous. Because that type of speech existed with them, 
and because they had internal breathing, they were therefore able to live in company with angels. </p>

Quod talis etiam loquela fuerit antiquissimis in hac tellure, etiam per conversationem cum quibusdam ex illis datum est scire, de qua videatur n. 607, 608; {1}ut elucidetur haec res, licet iterum referre 
quae de loquela antiquissimorum hujus telluris per experientiam scire {2}data sunt, quae sunt haec quae nunc sequuntur: </p>
<p>	Ostensum est mihi per influxum quendam quem describere non possum, {3}qualis 
loquela fuerat illorum qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia fuerunt, quod nempe non articulata sicut loquela vocum nostri temporis, sed tacita, quae fiebat non per respirationem externam sed per internam; 
appercipere etiam datum est qualis illorum respiratio interna fuit; {4}processit ab umbilico versus cor, et sic per labia absque sonoro cum loquerentur, et quod non intraverit in alterius aurem per 
viam externam, et (x)pulsaverit in quoddam quod vocatur tympanum auris, sed per viam quandam {5}internam, et quidem per quoddam ibi quod vocatur hodie tuba (x)Eustachiana; {6} ostensum quod per talem 
loquelam 2 multo plenius potuerint exprimere sensa animi et ideas cogitationis quam usquam fieri potest per sonos articulatos aut voces sonoras, quae similiter diriguntur per respirationem sed externam, 
nam nulla vox est, immo {7}nec (x)quicquam in voce quod non dirigitur per applicationes respirationis; sed apud illos multo perfectius, quia per respirationem internam, quae quia interior etiam perfectior 
est, et ipsis ideis cogitationis applicabilior et conformior; praeter etiam per labiorum motiunculas et correspondentes faciei mutationes; nam quoniam caelestes homines fuerunt, quicquid cogitabant 
hoc a facie et oculis illorum elucebat, quae conformiter (x)variabantur, facies quoad formam et quoad vitam et oculi quoad lucem; nusquam potuerunt alium vultum praeferre quam secundum illa quae 
cogitabant; simulatio, et magis adhuc dolus, illis fuit facinus enorme; quia talis illis loquela (c)et quia interna respiratio, ideo cum angelis potuerunt consortium habere, n. 1118. </p>
