<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7689节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7689.</strong>“又吞吃地上一切的菜蔬”表它消耗了真理的一切记忆知识。这从“吞吃”和“地上的菜蔬”的含义清楚可知：“吞吃”是指消耗；“地上的菜蔬”是指真理的记忆知识。“田间的菜蔬”表示教会的真理（参看<a href="7571.htm">7571</a>节），因为“田”是指教会；但“地上的菜蔬”表示真理的记忆知识，因为“地”在此是指属世心智；属世心智的真理是记忆知识。此外，恶人没有任何信之真理，只有关于信之真理的记忆知识。教会里有些恶人深信自己拥有信之真理，其实并没有；他们陷入虚假，反对信之真理。只要他们还在世上，他们所陷入的虚假就深深隐藏在他们里面；但在来世，当他们在所知道的信之真理方面经历荒凉时，这隐藏的虚假就会暴露并显现出来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7689</b></p><p><b>7689.</b>
And it devoured all the herb of the land. That this signifies that it consumed all the memory-knowledge of truth, is evident from the signification of "devouring," as being to consume; and from the signification 
of "the herb of the land," as being the memory-knowledge of truth; for by "the herb of the field" is signified the truth of the church (see n. 7571), because "field" denotes the church; but 
by "the herb of the land" is signified the memory-knowledge of truth, because "the land" here denotes the natural mind; and the truth of the natural mind is memory-knowledge; and moreover the evil 
have no truth by faith, but only the memory-knowledge of the truth which is of faith. Some evil men who are in the church persuade themselves that they are in truth by faith, but they are not; they are 
in falsity, and are against the truth of faith. That they are in falsity is hidden with them so long as they are in the world, but this hidden falsity comes forth and manifests itself in the other life 
when they are being devastated as to the truths of faith which they had known. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7689</b></p><p><b>7689.</b>
'And they devoured every plant in the land' means that it consumed every known fact about truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'devouring' as consuming; and from the meaning of 'a plant in the land' 
as a known fact about truth. For 'a plant in the field' means a truth that the Church possesses, <a href="7571.htm">7571</a>, because 'the field' is the Church, but 'a plant in the land' means a known fact about truth, 
because 'the land' here is the natural mind, and truth as it exists in the natural mind is factual knowledge. Furthermore the evil are not in possession of any truth of faith, only of knowledge about 
the truth of faith. Some evil people within the Church are convinced that they do possess the truth of faith, but they do not; they are ruled by falsity and opposed to the truth of faith. The falsity 
they are ruled by is deeply hidden within them as long as they are in the world, but that deeply hidden falsity emerges and reveals itself in the next life when they undergo vastation of the truths of 
faith they had known. </p>

</p><b>7689.</b>
`Et (x)comedit omnem herbam terrae': quod significet quod consumeret omne scientificum veri, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit consumere; et ex significatione `herbae terrae' quod sit {1}scientificum 
veri, nam per `herbam agri' significatur verum Ecclesiae, n. 7571, quia `ager' est Ecclesia; per `herbam' autem `terrae' significatur scientificum veri, quia `terra' hic est mens naturalis, 
et verum mentis naturalis est scientificum; et praeterea malis non est aliquod verum {2}fidei, sed est modo scientia veri quod fidei; persuadent sibi quidam mali qui in Ecclesia quod sint in vero 
{2}fidei, sed non sunt; in falso sunt, et contra verum fidei; quod in falso sint, hoc apud illos reconditum est quamdiu in mundo sunt, sed falsum id reconditum prodit et se manifestat in altera vita, 
quando devastantur quoad vera fidei quae sciverant. 	@1 verum Ecclesiae, de qua n. 7571, hic scientificum veri, quia malis non est verum, sed modo scientificum veri; qui enim in vita mali sunt, in falso 
sui mali sunt, utcunque in scientia veri, sibique persuadent quod sint in vero; falsum in quo sunt, apud illos reconditum est, ac prodit in altera vita quando devastantur quoad vera quae sciverunt$ 	@2 
fide IT.  But T suggests fidei as an alternative in his critical notes.$ </p>
