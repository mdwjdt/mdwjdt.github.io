<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4445节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4445.</strong>“因示剑在以色列中作了丑事，与雅各的女儿同寝，这本是不应该作的”表在他们眼里不合法的结合，违背了他们所拥有的真理。这从“作了丑事，与雅各的女儿同寝”的含义清楚可知，“作了丑事，与雅各的女儿同寝”是指不合法的结合。与她同寝并玷污她表示不合法的结合（参看<a href="4439.htm">4439</a>节）。经上之所以说“在以色列中”，是因为“以色列”表示教会的内在；接下来又说“雅各的女儿”，是因为“雅各”表示教会的外在。“以色列”表示教会的内在，“雅各”表示教会的外在（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4292.htm">4292</a>，<a href="4439.htm">4439</a>节）。尽管是合法的，但该结合在他们眼里仍看为不合法；这一点从刚才（<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>节）和别处的阐述和说明可以看出来。</p>

Because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter, and so it ought not to be done. That this signifies a conjunction that in their eyes was unlawful, because contrary to the truth 
which they had, is evident from the signification of "committing folly in lying with Jacob's daughter," as being unlawful conjunction. (That to lie with her and thus defile her, denotes conjunction 
not legitimate, may be seen above, n. 4439.) It is said "in Israel," because by "Israel" is signified the internal of the church; and it is next said "Jacob's daughter," because by "Jacob" is signified 
the external of the church. (That "Israel" is the internal of the church and "Jacob" the external, may be seen above, n. 4286, 4292, 4439.) That although lawful, the conjunction appeared in their eyes 
unlawful, may be seen from what has been said and shown just above (n. 4444), and in other places. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4445</b></p><p><b>4445.</b>
'Because he had done something disgraceful in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, a thing that ought not to be done' means a joining together which in their eyes was not permissible, going against 
the truth which they possessed. This is clear from the meaning of 'doing something disgraceful by lying with Jacob's daughter' as a joining together that was not permissible. As regards lying with her 
and defiling her meaning a wrongful joining together, see above in <a href="4439.htm">4439</a>. The expression 'in Israel' is used because 'Israel' means the internal Church, and after that the expression 'Jacob's daughter' 
because 'Jacob' means the external aspect of the Church. For 'Israel' means the internal aspect of the Church and 'Jacob' the external, see <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4292.htm">4292</a>, <a href="4439.htm">4439</a>. Its seeming in their eyes to be a joining 
together that was not permissible, though in fact it was permissible, becomes clear from what has been stated and shown immediately above in <a href="4444.htm">4444</a> and elsewhere. </p>

`Quia stultitiam fecit in Israele ad cubandum cum filia Jacobi, et ita non fiet': quod significet conjunctionem in oculis illorum illicitam contra verum quod illius {1}, constat ex significatione 
`stultitiam facere ad cubandum cum filia Jacobi' quod sit conjunctio illicita; quod cubare cum illa et sic polluere, sit conjunctio non legitima, videatur supra n. 4439 `in Israele' dicitur quia per 
`Israelem' significatur internum Ecclesiae, et dein `filia Jacobi' dicitur quia per `Jacobum' significatur externum Ecclesiae; quod `Israel' sit Ecclesiae internum, et `Jacob' externum, videatur 
n. 4286, 4292, 4439.  Quod in oculis illorum id apparuerit illicitum tametsi licitum, constare potest ab illis quae (o)mox supra n. 4444 et alibi dicta et ostensa sunt.      @1 changes illis to illius$ </p>
