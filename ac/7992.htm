<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7992节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7992.</strong>“以色列众人世世代代”表有真理所产生的良善和源于良善的真理在其中的那些属于属灵教会的人。这从“以色列人”的代表和“世代”的含义清楚可知：“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述；“世代”是指信与仁的事物（参看<a href="2020.htm">2020</a>，<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>，<a href="6239.htm">6239</a>节），因此是指那些有真理所产生的良善和源于良善的真理在其中的那些人；因为那些属于属灵教会的人通过信之真理被引入仁之良善，并且被引入良善后，又从良善被引向真理。从良善被引向真理的，就是那些构成内在教会的人；而通过真理被引入良善的，则是那些构成外在教会的人。</p>

For all the sons of Israel unto their generations. That this signifies those of the spiritual church with whom there is good from truth, and truth from good, is evident from the representation of the 
sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which frequently above); and from the signification of "generations," as being those things which are of faith and charity (see n. 2020, 
2584, 6239), thus those with whom there is good from truth and truth from good; for they who are of the spiritual church are introduced to the good which is of charity by means of the truth which 
is of faith, and when they have been introduced, they are led by good to truths. They who are led by good to truths are they who constitute the internal church; but they who are introduced to good by 
means of truth are they who constitute the external church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7992</b></p><p><b>7992.</b>
'For all the children of Israel (to observe] throughout their generations' means those belonging to the spiritual Church among whom there is good resulting from truth and truth springing from good. This 
is clear from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with often; and from the meaning of 'generations' as matters of faith and charity, dealt 
with in <a href="2010.htm">2010</a>, <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>, <a href="6239.htm">6239</a>. Those among whom there is good resulting from truth and truth springing from good are accordingly meant; for people belonging to the spiritual Church are led through the 
truth of faith into the good of charity, and having been led into good are then led from good to truths. Those led from good to truths are people who constitute the internal Church, whereas those led 
through truth into good are people who constitute the external Church. </p>

`Omnibus filiis Israelis ad generationes illorum': quod significet illos ab Ecclesia spirituali apud quos est bonum ex vero et verum ex bono, constat ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint 
qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua saepius; et ex significatione `generationum' quod sint illa quae fidei et charitatis, de qua n. 2020, 2584, 6239, ita apud quos bonum ex vero (c)et verum ex bono, 
qui enim ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt per verum quod fidei introducuntur ad bonum quod charitatis, ac cum introducti sunt, ex bono ducuntur ad vera; qui ex bono ad vera ducuntur sunt qui {1}constituunt 
Ecclesiam internam, qui autem per verum introducuntur ad bonum sunt qui externam. 	@1 internam Ecclesiam constituunt$ </p>
