<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7419节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7419.</strong>“使尘土变作虱子”表邪恶要从它们当中冒上来。这从“虱子”的含义清楚可知，“虱子”是指邪恶。但至于它们是什么样的邪恶，源于何处，这从邪恶与这种寄生虫的对应关系可以看出来。它们主要是感官层面，也就是完全的外在人中，或人心智完全的外在层面上的邪恶。这种对应关系来自以下事实：虱子生活在皮肤的最表层，就在那里的污垢之中和鳞屑之下。那些拥有信仰的知识，却过着邪恶生活之人的感官层也是这样。当这种知识从他们那里被夺走时，如这种人在来世所发生的情形，他们头脑又粗笨又愚蠢。他们多次出现在我面前；肮脏恶臭，令人厌恶。这些寄生虫的叮咬就表示邪恶的侵扰。“虱子”的这层含义无法从圣言中的其它经文那里得到证实，因为它们只在诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.31.htm">105:31</a>）论及埃及时再次被提及。</p>

And it shall become lice. That this signifies that evils will rise up therefrom, is evident from the signification of "lice," as being evils; but what evils they are, and from what origin, can be seen 
from the correspondence of evils with such vermin, in that they are especially the evils which are in the sensuous, that is, in the wholly external man. The correspondence is from this, that lice are 
in the outermost skin, and within dirt there, and beneath a scab. Such also is the sensuous of those who have been in the knowledge of faith, but in a life of evil. When this knowledge is taken away 
from them, as is done with such in the other life, they are then of a gross and stupid mind; they have sometimes appeared; they are foul and loathsome. Infestations by evils are signified by their biting. 
That such is the signification of "lice" cannot be confirmed by other passages from the Word, for they are mentioned elsewhere only in David when speaking of Egypt (Ps. 105:31). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7419</b></p><p><b>7419.</b>
'And it will then be lice' means that evils will rise up from them. This is clear from the meaning of 'lice' as evils. But what evils these are and where they originate becomes clear from the correspondence 
of evils with such parasites. They are primarily evils on the level of the senses or utterly external level of a person's mind. This correspondence arises from the fact that lice live on the outside 
of the skin, among the dirt there and under scaly skin. The sensory level in those who have come to possess a knowledge of matters of belief yet lead a life of evil is also like this. When that 
knowledge is taken away from them, as happens to such persons in the next life, they are then mentally thick and stupid. They have appeared before me on several occasions; they are foul and repulsive. 
Molestations by evils are meant by the bitings of those parasites. This meaning of 'lice' cannot be substantiated from other places in the Word, for they are mentioned again only in David, where he 
refers to what took place in Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:31</a>. </p>

</p><b>7419.</b>
`Et erit in pediculos': quod significet quod inde exsurgent mala, constat a significatione `pediculorum' quod sint mala; quae autem mala sunt et ex qua origine, constare potest (c)a correspondentia 
malorum cum talibus, quod sint imprimis mala quae in sensuali, seu in prorsus externo homine; correspondentia inde est quia pediculi in externa cute sunt, et ibi intra sordes et sub scabie; sensuale illorum 
qui in scientia fidei fuerunt at in vita mali est quoque tale; cum {1} illis aufertur scientia illa, ut fit talibus in altera vita, tunc sunt crassae et obesae mentis; apparuerunt aliquoties, {2} 
sunt taetri et aversatiles; infestationes per mala significantur per quod mordeant.  Quod `pediculi' illa significent, non ex aliis locis in Verbo confirmari potest, nam memorantur solum apud Davidem, 
ubi de Aegypto, Ps. cv 31. 	@1 i enim$ 	@2 i ac$ </p>
