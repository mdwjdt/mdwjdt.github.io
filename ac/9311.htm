<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9311节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9311.</strong>“你若实在听从他的声音”表学习并接受信之诫命。这从“听从”和“他的声音”的含义清楚可知：“听从”是指学习并接受，如下文所述；“他的声音”是指信之诫命（参看<a href="9307.htm">9307</a>节）。在圣言中，“听从”不仅表示简单地用耳朵听，还表示在记忆中接受，学习，以及在理解力中接受，相信，另外表示以服从来接受，以及实行。“听从”之所以表示这些事，是因为耳朵所听见的话语会转入一个人的内在视觉，也就是理解力，由此在这个人里面被接受。然后在那里照着所给出的理由的说服力，或来自某个其它源头的劝说能力，所听见的东西要么保留，要么被相信，要么被服从。正因如此，在灵界，耳朵和听觉与这类事物有一种对应关系（参看<a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>，<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>，<a href="7216.htm">7216</a>，<a href="8361.htm">8361</a>，<a href="8990.htm">8990</a>节）。<br />“听”表示在记忆中接受，学习，以及在理解力接受，相信，另外表示以服从来接受，以及实行，这一点从以下经文地方也明显看出来。马太福音：<br />我用比喻讲，是因他们看也看不见，听也听不见，也不明白。在他们身上，正应了以赛亚书的预言，说，你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得。因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着；恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白。但你们的眼睛是有福的，因为看见了；你们的耳朵也是有福的，因为听见了。从前有许多先知和义人想看你们所看的，却没有看见；要听你们所听的，却没有听见。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.13.htm">13:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.17.htm">17</a>）<br />在这段经文中，经上在各个含义上用到了“听”这个词；它既表示学习和相信，也表示服从；“听也听不见”表示被教导，却不相信，也表示学习，却不服从；“耳朵发沉”表示拒绝学习、相信和服从；“因为听见而有福的耳朵”表示由于接受涉及主并通过圣言从主所获得的信之教义而来的祝福。<br />约翰福音：<br />从门进去的，才是羊的牧人；羊也听祂的声音。凡在我以先的，都是贼，是强盗，羊却不听他们。我另外有羊，不是这圈里的；我必须领他们来，他们也要听我的声音，并且要合成一个羊群，归一个牧人了。我的羊听我的声音，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.2.htm">10:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.27.htm">27</a>）<br />“听声音”表示学习信之真理，并以信仰和服从来接受它们。主经常所说的话也表示这些事：<br />凡有耳的，就应当听。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.15.htm">11:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.9.htm">13:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">43</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.9.htm">4:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.16.htm">7:16</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.8.htm">8:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.35.htm">14:35</a>）<br />在下列经文中所表示类似的事：<br />看哪，有声音从云彩里出来说，这是我所喜悦的儿子，你们要听祂。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.5.htm">17:5</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />娶新妇的就是新郎，新郎的朋友站着听见新郎，因新郎的声音就甚喜乐。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.29.htm">3:29</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />我实实在在地告诉你们：时候将到，死人要听见神儿子的声音，听见的人就要活了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.25.htm">5:25</a>）<br />“死人”表示那些由于缺乏信之真理的知识而尚未拥有属灵生命的人；“听见神儿子的声音”表示学习并服从信之真理；“活了”表示通过这些真理被赋予属灵生命。<br /><br />出于神的，必听神的话；你们不听，因为你们不是出于神。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.47.htm">8:47</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，凡属真理的人就听我的声音。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.37.htm">18:37</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />亚伯拉罕对财主说，他们有摩西和先知，让他们听他们吧。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.29.htm">16:29</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />关于耶稣，他们说，祂所做的事都好，祂使聋子听见，使哑巴说话。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.37.htm">7:37</a>）<br />“聋子”表示那些不知道信之真理，因而无法照之生活的人（<a href="6989.htm">6989</a>节）；“听见”表示学习、接受并服从。约翰福音：<br />只等真理的圣灵来了，祂要引导你们进入一切的真理，因为祂不是凭自己说的，乃是把祂所听见的都说出来。祂必从我领受。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“祂所听见的”表示凡祂从主所获得的。马太福音：<br />凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人。凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个愚拙的人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.24.htm">7:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，我要告诉你们他像什么人。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.47.htm">6:47</a>）<br />“听见祂的话”或“听见祂说”表示学习并知道来自主的信之诫命；“去行”表示照它们生活。</p>

For in hearing thou shalt hear his voice. That this signifies instruction in the commandments of faith, and reception, is evident from the signification of "hearing," as being to be instructed and to 
receive (of which below); and from the signification of "his voice," as being the commandments of faith (see above, n. 9307). "To hear," in the Word, signifies not merely to hear in simplicity, but also 
to receive in the memory and to be instructed, likewise to receive in the understanding and to believe, and also to receive with obedience and to do. That these things are signified by "hearing," 
is because the speech which is heard presents itself before the internal sight, or understanding, and is thus inwardly received; and there, according to the cogency of the reasons given, or according 
to the powers of persuasion from some other source, what is heard is either retained, or believed, or obeyed. From this it is that in the spiritual world there is a correspondence of the ear and of hearing 
with such things (see n. 4652-4660, 5017, 7216, 8361, 8990). [2] That "to hear" denotes to receive in the memory and to be instructed, also to receive in the understanding and believe, likewise 
to receive in obedience and do, is plain also from the following passages. In Matthew: </p>
<p>     I speak in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand; that 
in them may be fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive; the heart of this people is waxed 
gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest haply they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart. Blessed are your eyes, 
for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, but have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, but have not heard 
them (Matt. 13:13-17); </p>
<p>"to hear" is here used in every sense; in that of being instructed; in that of believing; and in that of obeying. "Hearing they hear not" denotes to be taught and yet not 
to believe; and also to be instructed and not to obey; "to have ears dull of hearing" denotes to refuse instruction, belief, and obedience; "the ears which are blessed because they hear" denote blessedness 
from the reception of the doctrine of faith concerning the Lord, and through the Word from the Lord. [3] In John: </p>
<p>     He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. The sheep hear 
his voice. Those who were before Me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; 
and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me (John 10:2, 3, 8, 16, 27); </p>
<p>"to hear the voice" denotes to be instructed in the commandments 
of faith, and to receive them with faith and obedience. The same is signified by what the Lord so often said: </p>
<p>     He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear (Matt. 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 23; 7:16; 
Luke 8:8; 14:35). [4] Similar things are signified also in these passages: </p>
<p>     Behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him (Matt. 17:5).      He that hath the bride 
is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice (John 3:29).      Verily I say unto you, The hour cometh when 
the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live (John 5:25); </p>
<p>"the dead" denote those who as yet have no spiritual life, by reason of ignorance of the truth of faith; 
"to hear the voice of the Son of God" denotes to be instructed in the truths of faith, and to obey them; "to live" denotes to be endowed with spiritual life through these truths. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     He 
that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear not, because ye are not of God (John 8:47).      Jesus said, Everyone that is of the truth heareth My voice (John 18:37).      Abraham 
said to the rich man, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them (Luke 16:29).      They said of Jesus, He hath done all things well, for He maketh the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak 
(Mark 7:37); </p>
<p> "the deaf" denote those who do not know the truths of faith, and therefore cannot live according to them (n. 6989); "to hear" denotes to be instructed, to receive, and to obey. In John: </p>
<p> 
    When the Holy Spirit is come, He shall lead you into all truth. He shall not speak from Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak. He shall take of Mine (John 16:13, 
14); </p>
<p>"what things soever he shall hear" denotes whatsoever he shall receive from the Lord. Again: </p>
<p>     Everyone who heareth My words, and doeth them, I will liken him to a prudent man; but everyone 
that heareth these words of Mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man (Matt. 7:24, 26).      Everyone that cometh unto Me, and heareth My sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to 
whom he is like (Luke 6:47).  "To hear His words," or "sayings," denotes to learn and know the commandments of faith which are from the Lord; "to do them" denotes to live according to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9311</b></p><p><b>9311.</b>
'For if you indeed hear his voice' means learning and accepting the commandments of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing' as learning and accepting, dealt with below; and from the meaning 
of 'voice' as the commandments of faith, as above in <a href="9307.htm">9307</a>. In the Word 'hearing' means much more than simply hearing with the ear. Besides this it means receiving things in the memory and learning them, 
also receiving them in the understanding and believing them, and in addition receiving them in obedience and doing them. The reason why all this is meant by 'hearing' is that speech heard by the 
ear passes on into a person's inner sight, which is the understanding, and so is received within the person. Then what is seen there is either retained, believed, or obeyed, according to how compelling 
the reasons for it are or else how far the person has been swayed by others. So it is that there is a correspondence of the ear and of hearing with such things in the spiritual world; regarding this, 
see <a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>, <a href="5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="7216.htm">7216</a>, <a href="8361.htm">8361</a>, <a href="8990.htm">8990</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'hearing' means receiving things in the memory and learning them, also receiving them in the understanding and believing them, and in addition 
receiving them in obedience and doing them, is also evident from the following places: In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
I speak in parables, because those who see do not see, and those who hear do not hear, nor 
do they understand, that in them may be fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, By hearing you will hear and not understand, and seeing you will see and not discern. This people's heart has become 
gross, and with ears they have heard in a dull manner, and their eyes they have closed, lest perhaps they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and with their heart understand. Blessed are your 
eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. Many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:12-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:12-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In this passage the word 'hear' is used with all its meanings; it stands both for learning and for believing, as well as for obeying. 'Those who hear do not hear' stands for being taught things 
and yet not believing them, also for learning them and not obeying them. 'With ears they have heard in a dull manner' stands for refusing to learn, believe, and obey. 'Blessed are your ears, for they 
hear' stands for the blessedness that comes as a result of accepting the teachings of faith which concern the Lord and are received through the Word from the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who enters by 
the door is the shepherd of the sheep; the sheep hear His voice. Those who were before Me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; I 
must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:2,%203,%208,%2016,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:2, 3, 8, 16, 27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Hearing His 
voice' stands for learning the commandments of faith and accepting them in faith and obedience. The same things are meant by the words the Lord used so many times, He who has an ear to hear, let him hear, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:15;%2013:9,%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:15; 13:9, 43</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:9,%2023;%207:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:9, 23; 7:16</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:8;%2014:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:8; 14:35</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The same are also meant in the following places: In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, a voice from the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son; 
hear Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Truly I say to you, that the hour will come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:25</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The dead' stands for those 
who do not as yet have spiritual life owing to lack of knowledge of the truth of faith; 'hearing the voice of the Son of God' stands for learning the truths of faith and obeying them; 'living' stands 
for being endowed with spiritual life through those truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who is of God hears God's words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:47</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2018:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 18:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Abraham said to the rich man, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Mark,  </p>
<blockquote>
They said about Jesus, He has done all things well, for He makes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%207:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 7:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The deaf' stands for those who have no knowledge of the 
truths of faith and therefore are unable to live in accordance with them, see <a href="6989.htm">6989</a>. 'Hearing' stands for learning, accepting, and obeying them. In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
When the Spirit of Truth comes He will guide 
you into all truth; He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak. He will receive from what is Mine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:13, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Whatever He hears' stands for whatever He receives from 
the Lord. In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who hears My words and does them I will liken to a wise man. But everyone hearing My words yet not doing them will be likened to a foolish man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:24, 26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And 
in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show [you] whom he is like. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:47</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Hearing His words' and 'hearing His sayings' stand for learning and 
knowing the commandments of faith which come from the Lord; 'doing' stands for living in accordance with them.  </p>

`Quia si audiendo audiveris vocem ejus': quod significet instructionem de praeceptis fidei, et receptionem, constat ex significatione `audire' quod sit instrui et recipere, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione 
`vocis' quod sint praecepta fidei, ut supra n. 9307.  `Audire' in Verbo significat non solum simpliciter audire sed etiam recipere memoria et instrui, tum recipere intellectu et credere, ut 
et recipere oboedientia et facere; quod illa per `audire' significentur, est quia loquela quae auditur se sistit coram visu interno seu intellectu, et sic intus recipitur, ac ibi secundum rationum efficaciam 
aut secundum vires persuasionis aliunde, vel retinentur, vel creduntur, vel oboediuntur; inde est quod correspondentia auris et auditus sit cum talibus in mundo spirituali, de qua videatur n. 
4652-4660, 5017, 7216, 8361, 8990. 	[2] Quod `audire' sit recipere memoria (c)et instrui, tum recipere intellectu et credere, ut et recipere oboedientia et facere, patet etiam a sequentibus his locis 
{1}, ut apud Matthaeum, 	Per parabolas loquor, quia videntes non vident, et audientes non audiunt, nec intelligunt; ut compleatur {2} in iis prophetia Esaiae, quae dicit, Auditu audietis et non intelligetis, 
et videntes videbitis et non cernetis; (x)incrassatum est cor populi hujus, et auribus graviter audiverunt, et oculos suos occluserunt, ne forte videant oculis, et auribus audiant, et corde 
intelligant.  Vestri beati sunt oculi quia vident, et aures vestrae quia audiunt; multi prophetae et justi desideraverunt videre quae videtis, sed non viderunt, et audire quae auditis, sed non audiverunt, 
xiii 12-17; </p>
<p>hic `audire' dicitur in omni sensu, tam pro instrui quam pro credere, et pro oboedire; audientes non audiunt' pro doceri et tamen non credere, tum pro instrui et non oboedire, `auribus 
graviter audire' pro renuere instructionem, fidem, et oboedientiam, `beatae aures quia audiunt' pro beatitudine ex receptione doctrinae fidei de Domino et per Verbum a Domino: [3] apud Johannem, 	Qui 
ingrediens est per januam, pastor est ovium; oves vocem Ipsius audiunt: qui ante Me fuerunt, fures fuerunt et latrones; sed non audiverunt illos oves. Alias oves habeo quae non sunt ex hoc ovili; 
etiam illas oportet Me adducere, et vocem Meam audient, et fiet unus grex et unus pastor: oves Meae vocem Meam audiunt, et Ego cognosco eas, et sequuntur Me, x 2, 3, 8, 16, 27; </p>
<p>`audire vocem' pro instrui 
de praeceptis fidei, `ac recipere illa fide et oboedientia: similia significantur per `ea quae Dominus toties dixit, 	Qui habet aurem ad audiendum, audiat, Matth. xi 15, xiii 9, 43; Marc. iv 9, 
(x)23, vii 16; Luc. viii 8, xiv 35; </p>
<p>similia quoque in sequentibus locis: apud Matthaeum, 	Ecce vox e nube dicens, Hic est Filius Meus dilectus; Ipsum audite, xvii 5: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Qui habet sponsam 
sponsus est, amicus autem sponsi, qui stat et audit ipsum, gaudio gaudet ob vocem sponsi, iii 29 [4] apud eundem, 	Amen dico vobis quod veniet hora quando mortui audient vocem Filii Dei, et qui 
audient vivent, v 25; </p>
<p>`mortui' pro illis qui adhuc non habent vitam spiritualem {3} ex ignorantia veri fidei, `audire vocem Filii Dei' pro instrui in veris fidei et illis oboedire, `vivere' pro donari 
vita spirituali per illa: apud eundem, 	Qui est ex Deo verba Dei audit, propterea vos non auditis quia ex Deo non estis, viii 47: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Jesus dixit, Omnis qui est ex veritate audit Meam 
vocem, xviii 37: </p>
<p>apud Lucam, 	Abraham ad divitem, Habent Moschen et Prophetas; audiunto illos, xvi 29: </p>
<p>[5] apud Marcum, 	Dicebant de Jesu, Bene omnia fecit, nam surdos facit audire, et mutos loqui, 
vii 37; </p>
<p>`surdi' pro illis qui non sciunt vera fidei, et ideo {4} non possunt vivere secundum illa, videatur n. 6989, `audire' pro instrui, recipere, et oboedire: apud Johannem, 	Quando venerit Spiritus 
veritatis {5}, ducet vos in omnem veritatem; non loquetur a seipso, sed quaecumque audiverit loquetur, ex Meo accipiet, xvi 13, 14; </p>
<p>`quaecumque audiverit' pro quaecumque receperit ex Domino: apud 
Matthaeum, 	Omnis qui audit Mea verba et facit ea, comparabo viro prudenti, at omnis audiens verba Mea sed non faciens ea comparabitur viro stulto, vii 24, 26: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam, 	Omnis qui venit ad 
Me, et audit sermones Meos, et facit eos, monstrabo cui similis est, vi 47; </p>
