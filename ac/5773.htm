<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5773节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5773.</strong>“他们就撕裂衣服”表哀悼。这从“撕裂衣服”的含义清楚可知，“撕裂衣服”是指由于丧失真理而哀悼（参看<a href="4763.htm">4763</a>节），在此是指由于来自他们自己、他们无法再声称属于自己的真理而哀悼，因为他们已经既在管理约瑟家的那人面前（44:9），又在约瑟自己面前（44:16）将自己献为奴仆，这意味着他们将没有自己的自由，因而没有他们自己的真理。<br />至于他们“撕裂衣服”并将自己献为奴仆所表示的由于他们自己的真理而哀悼，要知道，对那些正在重生的人来说，一种反转在发生。也就是说，首先，他们通过真理被引向良善，然后从良善被引向真理。当这种反转发生，或这种状态改变，变成前一种状态的反面时，就有了哀悼。因为那时他们被引入试探，属于他们自己的东西通过试探被削弱并瓦解，良善被引入。与这良善一起的一个新意愿，以及与这新意愿一起的一个新自由，因而他们自己的某种新东西也被引入。这一切由约瑟的兄弟在绝望中返回到约瑟那里，并将自己献为他的奴仆，被保持在这种状态一段时候来代表，也由约瑟一直没有向他们表明自己究竟是谁，直到这试探结束来代表。因为一旦试探结束，主就会光照他们，并带来安慰。</p>

And they rent their garments. That this signifies mourning, is evident from the signification of "rending the garments," as being mourning on account of truth being lost (see n. 4763), here on account 
of truths from their own which they could no longer claim to themselves, because they had offered themselves as servants both in the presence of him that was over Joseph's house (verse 9), and in the 
presence of Joseph himself (verse 16), whereby is signified that they would be without freedom from their own, thus without truths from themselves. As regards mourning on account of truths from their 
own, which is signified by their "rending their garments and offering themselves as servants," be it known that a turning about takes place with those who are being regenerated, namely, that they are 
led to good by means of truth, and afterward from good they are led to truth. When this turning about takes place, or when the state is changed and becomes the inverse of the former one, there is mourning; 
for they are then let into temptation, whereby what is of their own is weakened and broken down, and good is insinuated, and with good a new will, and with this a new freedom, thus a new own. 
This is represented by Joseph's brethren returning in despair to Joseph, and offering themselves to him as servants, and their being kept in that state for some time, and by Joseph's not manifesting himself 
until after the temptation; for when the temptation is over, the Lord shines on them with comfort. </p>

'And they rent their clothes' means mourning. This is clear from the meaning of 'rending one's clothes' as mourning over lost truth, dealt with in <a href="4763.htm">4763</a>, in this case over truths of their own which they 
could no longer lay claim to, since they offered to become slaves both in front of the one who was over Joseph's house, verse 9, and in front of Joseph himself, verse 16, which meant that they had 
no freedom of their own, and accordingly no truths of their own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards mourning over truths of their own, which mourning is meant by them rending their clothes and offering to become slaves, 
it should be recognized that with people who are being regenerated a reversal takes place. That is to say, first they are led by means of truth to good, but after that they are led from good to truth. 
When this reversal takes place, or when the state is altered and becomes the reverse of what existed previously, there is mourning. For they are subjected to temptations, by means of which things 
properly their own are weakened and broken down, and good is introduced. Together with that good a new will is introduced, and with this a new freedom, and so something new of their own. This is represented 
by the return of Joseph's brothers in despair to Joseph and their offer to become slaves; by the retention of them for quite a long time in that state; and by Joseph's not revealing to them who 
he really was until that temptation was over. For once temptation is completed the Lord sheds light and brings comfort with it.  </p>

`Et disruperunt vestes {1}':  quod significet luctum, constat  ex significatione `disrumpere vestes' quod sit luctus ob verum amissum, de qua n. 4763, hic ob vera ex proprio quae sibi vindicare non 
amplius possent, quia se in servos obtulerunt,tam coram illo qui super domo Josephi, vers. 9, quam coram ipso Josepho, vers. 16; per quod significatur quod absque libero ex proprio essent, ita absque 
veris ex semet.  [2]Quod luctum ob vera ex proprio attinet, qui significatur per quod `disruperint vestes et se obtulerint in servos, sciendum quod apud illos qui regenerantur, versura fiat, nempe quod 
per verum ducantur ad bonum, et {2}postea quod ex bono ducantur ad verum; cum versura illa fit, seu cum mutatur status ille, et fit inversus priori, tunc luctus {3}, nam mittuntur tunc in tentationem 
per quam infirmantur et debilitantur illa quae proprii sunt, et insinuatur bonum, et cum bono novum velle, cumque hoc novum liberum, ita novum proprium; hoc repraesentatur per quod fratres Josephi ex 
desperatione reversi sint ad Josephum et se obtulerint ei in servos, et quod satis diu detenti fuerint in statu illo; {4}quodque non nisi quam post tentationem illam Josephus se manifestaverit; nam 
peracta tentatione illucet Dominus cum solatio. @1 A I o suas here;cp. 5772.$ @2 dein$ @3 est, then probably d$ @4 et quod$ </p>
