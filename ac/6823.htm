<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6823节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6823.</strong>主的国度是比人生于其中的教会等级更高的邻舍，因为主的国度由所有处于良善的人，无论地上的还是天上的组成。这意味着主的国度在于良善，包括总体上所有良善的种类。热爱这良善，就会热爱处于良善的每个人。因此，整体，也就是总体上的所有良善，构成第一等级的邻舍。它构成大人，也就是众多章节末尾所论述过的主题；这（大）人就是主自己的一个代表形像。当出于至深的情感向那些从主通过那人变成真正的人，因而主的国度建在其中的人行善，利益他们时，就是在爱这（大）人，也就是主的国度。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6823</b></p><p><b>6823.</b>
The Lord's kingdom is the neighbor in a higher degree than the church in which one is born; for the Lord's kingdom consists of all who are in good, both on earth and in the heavens; thus the Lord's kingdom 
is good with every quality of it in the complex; and when this good is loved, everyone who is in good is loved. Thus the whole, which is all good in the complex, is the neighbor in the first degree, 
and is that Grand Man which has been treated of at the end of many chapters, which Man is a representative image of the Lord Himself. This Man, that is, the Lord's kingdom, is loved, when from inmost 
affection those are benefited who are men through that man from the Lord, thus with whom is the Lord's kingdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6823</b></p><p><b>6823.</b>
The Lord's kingdom is the neighbour in a higher degree than the Church in which anyone is born, for the Lord's kingdom is made up of all those who are governed by good both on earth and in heaven. This 
means that the Lord's kingdom consists in good, which includes all kinds of good in their entirety. When this good is loved so are individual persons who are governed by good. Thus the whole, that 
is, all good in its entirety, constitutes the neighbour in the first degree. It constitutes the Grand Man, which was the subject at the ends of quite a number of chapters, the Man who is an image representative 
of the Lord Himself. This Man, which is the Lord's kingdom, is loved when from deepest affection good is done to those who are by means of that Man made truly human by the Lord, thus those 
among whom the Lord's kingdom is established. </p>

</p><b>6823.</b>
Regnum Domini est proximus in superiore gradu quam Ecclesia, {1}ubi quis natus est; nam regnum Domini consistit ex omnibus {2} qui in bono sunt, tam qui in terris quam qui in caelis; ita est regnum 
Domini bonum cum omni ejus quali in complexu; hoc bonum cum amatur, amantur singuli qui in bono.  Ita totum, quod est omne bonum in complexu, est proximus in primo gradu, et est Maximus ille Homo de quo 
ad finem plurium capitum actum est, qui Homo est imago repraesentativa Ipsius Domini; (m)ille Homo, hoc est, regnum Domini, amatur cum ex affectione intima benefit illis qui sunt homo per illum Hominem 
a Domino, ita apud quos est regnum Domini.(n) 	@1 in qua$ 	@2 i in universo$ </p>
