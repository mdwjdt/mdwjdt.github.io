Verses 18-20. And he came unto his father and said, My father; and he said, Behold me, who art thou my son? And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou spokest 
unto me; arise I pray thee, sit, and eat of my hunting, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast hastened to find it, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah 
thy God made it come to meet my face. "And he came unto his father and said, My father; and he said, Behold me, who art thou my son?" signifies a state of perception from the presence of that truth; "and 
Jacob said unto his father," signifies the observation of natural truth; "I am Esau thy firstborn," signifies that it believed that it was natural good itself; "I have done according as thou spokest 
unto me" signifies obedience; "arise I pray thee, sit, and eat of my hunting," signifies the truth of the affection of such good; "that thy soul may bless me," signifies conjunction; "and Isaac said 
unto his son," signifies perception; "how is it that thou hast hastened to find it, my son?" signifies production so speedy, "and he said, Because Jehovah thy God made it come to meet my face," signifies 
providence. </p>

Verses 18-20 And he went to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Behold, here I am; who are you, my son? And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done what you told me. 
Rise up now; sit, and eat from my venison, so that your soul may bless me. And Isaac said to his son, Why have you found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God caused it to come 
before my face. </p>
<p>'He went to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Behold, here I am; who are you, my son?' means a state of perception resulting from the presence of that truth. 'And Jacob 
said to his father' means discernment by natural truth. 'I am Esau your firstborn' means that it believed itself to be natural good itself. 'I have done what you told me' means obedience. 'Rise up now; 
sit, and eat from my venison' means truth belonging to the affection for that kind of good. 'So that your soul may bless me' means conjunction. 'And Isaac said to his son' means perception. 'Why have 
you found it so quickly, my son?' means so rapid a production. 'And he said, Because Jehovah your God caused it to come before my face' means provision. </p>

Vers. 18-20.  Et venit ad patrem suum, et dixit, Pater mi, et dixit, Ecce me, quis tu fili mi? Et dixit Jacob ad patrem suum, Ego Esau primogenitus tuus, feci quemadmodum locutus es ad me, surge quaeso, 
sede et ede e venatione mea, propterea ut benedicat mihi anima tua. Et dixit Jishak ad filium suum, Quid hoc festinasti invenire, fili mi? et dixit, Quia obvenire fecit Jehovah Deus tuus ad faciem 
meam. `Venit ad patrem suum, et dixit, Pater mi; et dixit, Ecce me, quis tu fili mi?' significat statum perceptionis ex praesentia illius veri: `et dixit Jacob ad patrem suum' significat apperceptionem 
veri naturalis: `Ego Esau primogenitus tuus' significat quod crederet esse ipsum bonum naturale: `feci quemadmodum locutus es ad me' significat oboedientiam: `surge quaeso, sede, et ede e venatione 
mea' significat verum affectionis talis boni: `propterea ut benedicat mihi anima tua' significat conjunctionem: `et dixit Jishak ad filium suum' significat perceptionem: `Quid hoc festinasti invenire, 
fili mi?' significat productionem tam festinam: `et dixit, Quia obvenire fecit Jehovah Deus tuus ad faciem meam' significat providentiam. </p>
