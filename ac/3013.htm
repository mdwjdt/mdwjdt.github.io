<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3013节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3013.</strong>就内义而言，引入的过程是这样来描述的：当状态预备好后，一切事物都被主重新排列，归入神性属天秩序，好叫神圣真理可以与主神圣理性良善结合。这种重新排列是经由正常渠道通过属世人实现的，也就是说，是通过属世人中记忆知识、认知和教义实现的。那时，真理凭借主的神性流注从那里被召唤出来，被引入该理性里面的良善中，并变成神性。这理性在真理以及良善方面就这样被主变成神性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3013</b></p><p><b>3013.</b>
In the internal sense the process of initiation is thus described: When the state was prepared, and all things had been reduced by the Lord into Divine celestial order, so that Divine truth might be 
conjoined with the Divine good of His rational, and this by the common way from the natural man, that is, from the memory-knowledges, knowledges, and doctrinal things therein, then by the Lord's Divine 
influx truths were called forth thence; were initiated into good in the rational; and were made Divine. Thus was the rational made Divine by the Lord in respect to truth as well as in respect to good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3013</b></p><p><b>3013.</b>
The process of introduction is described in the internal sense as follows: When the state was reached in which all things had been rearranged by the Lord into a Divine celestial order so that Divine 
Truth might be joined to the Divine Good of His Rational - a re-arrangement achieved through the normal channel from the natural man, that is to say, from the facts, cognitions, and matters of doctrine 
in the natural man - truths were at that point summoned from there by means of the Lord's Divine influx, introduced into good in the rational, and made Divine. Thus the Rational was made Divine by the 
Lord as regards truth as well as regards good. </p>

</p><b>3013.</b>
Processus initiationis in sensu interno ita descriptus est: cum status esset, et omnia in ordinem Divinum caelestem redacta a Domino ut Divino Bono Rationalis Ipsius conjungeretur Divinum Verum, et 
hoc per viam communem ex naturali homine, nempe ex scientificis, cognitionibus et doctrinalibus quae ibi, quod tunc per influxum Divinum Domini inde vera evocata, initiata bono in rationali, et facta 
Divina; ita quod Rationale a Domino factam Divinum sicut quoad bonum, etiam quoad verum. </p>
