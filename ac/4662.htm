<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4662节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4662.</strong>当人子在祂荣耀里，众圣天使与祂一同降临的时候，祂要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上。万族都要聚集在祂面前。祂要把他们彼此分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般；把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。于是，王要向那右边的说，你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。因为我饿了，你们给我吃；渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了，你们看顾我；我在监里，你们来看我。义人就回答祂说，主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了供养你？或渴了，给你喝？什么时候见你作客旅，留你住？或是赤身露体，给你穿？又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你呢？王要回答他们说，我实在告诉你们：这些事你们既做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是做在我身上了。祂又要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！因为我饿了，你们不给我吃；渴了，你们不给我喝；我作客旅，你们不留我住；我赤身露体，你们不给我穿；我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。他们也要回答祂说，主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，或渴了，或作客旅，或赤身露体，或病了，或在监里，不伺候你呢？祂要回答他们说，我实在告诉你们：这些事你们既不做在这些最小的一个身上，就是不做在我身上了。这些人，要往永刑里去；那些义人，要往永生里去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">25:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.46.htm">46</a>）</p>

When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory; and before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate them 
one from another as a shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats; and He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come 
ye blessed of My Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was a hungered, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me to drink; I was a stranger, and 
ye gathered Me; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto Me. Then shall the righteous answer Him, saying, lord, when saw we Thee a hungered, and fed 
Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee to drink? When saw we Thee a stranger, and gathered Thee? or naked, and clothed Thee? Or when saw we Thee sick, or in prison, and came unto Thee? And the King shall answer 
and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me. Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart 
from Me ye cursed into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hungered, and ye gave Me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me not to drink; I was a stranger, and ye gathered 
Me not; naked, and ye clothed Me not [sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me not]. Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee a hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, 
or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee ? Then shall He answer them saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me. And these 
shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into life eternal (Matt. 25:31-46). </p>

When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. And before Him all nations will be gathered, and He will separate them one from 
another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and He will place the sheep at His right hand but the goats at the left. Then the King will say to those who are at His right hand, Come, O blessed 
of My Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I was a stranger and you took Me 
in, naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me. Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and 
give You drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You? But the King answering will say to them, Truly I say 
to you, Insofar as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers you did it to Me. Then He will also say to those on the left hand, Depart from Me, O cursed ones, into eternal fire prepared for 
the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in 
prison and you did not visit Me. Then they also will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You? Then He will 
answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Insofar as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to Me. And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. </p>

`Quando venerit Filius hominis in gloria Sua, et omnes sancti angeli cum Ipso, tunc sedebit super throno gloriae Ipsius; </p>
<p>et congregabuntur coram Ipso omnes gentes, et separabit eas ab invicem, sicut 
pastor separat oves ab hircis; et statuet quidem oves a dextris suis, at hircos a sinistris: tunc dicet Rex iis qui a dextris Ipsius, Venite benedicti Patris Mei, possidete paratum vobis regnum 
a fundatione mundi; esurivi enim et dedistis Mihi edere; sitivi et potastis Me; peregrinus fui et collegistis Me; </p>
<p>nudus et amicivistis Me; aegrotus fui et visitastis Me; in carcere fui et venistis 
ad Me: tunc respondebunt Ipsi justi, dicentes, Domine, quando Te vidimus esurientem et aluimus Te; aut sitientem et potavimus? quando vero Te vidimus peregrinum et collegimus; aut nudum et amicivimus; 
quando vero Te vidimus aegrotum, aut in carcere, et venimus ad Te? sed respondens Rex dicet illis, Amen dico vobis, quantum fecistis uni horum fratrum Meorum minimorum, Mihi fecistis.  Tunc dicet 
etiam iis qui a sinistris, Discedite a Me maledicti in ignem aeternum paratum diabolo et angelis ejus; </p>
<p>esurivi enim et non dedistis Mihi edere; sitivi et non potastis Me; </p>
<p>peregrinus fui et non 
collegistis Me; nudus et non amicivistis Me; </p>
<p>aegrotus et in carcere, et non visitastis Me: tunc respondebunt Ipsi et isti, dicentes, Domine, quando Te vidimus esurientem, aut sitientem, aut peregrinum, 
aut nudum, aut aegrotum, aut in carcere, et non ministravimus Tibi?  Tunc respondebit illis, dicens, Amen dico vobis, quantum non fecistis uni istorum minimorum, neque Mihi fecistis: et abibunt 
hi in poenam aeternam, at justi in vitam aeternam.' </p>
