<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>981.</strong>“神赐福”表主的临在和恩典。这一点从“赐福”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，就外在意义而言，“赐福”是指富有一切世俗和肉体的好处。这也是所有停留于外在意义上的人解读圣言的方式，如古今犹太人，以及基督徒，尤其现代基督徒。因此，他们一直将神性赐福置于财富、万物充裕和个人荣耀中。然而，就内在意义而言，“赐福”是指富有一切属灵和属天的好处，这种赐福若非出于主，就不存在，也不可能存在。这就是为何“赐福”表主的临在和恩典的原因。主的临在和恩典里面就带有这类属灵和属天的好处，因为主只存在于仁爱中，此处所论述的重生的属灵之人就是通过仁爱行事。主的确与每个人同在，不过，人距离仁爱越远，主的临在程度就越低，也就是说，越不在场，即主就越遥远。<br />至于为何提及“恩典”而非“怜悯”，原因（我猜想，这原因迄今不为人知）在于，属天之人不提恩典，只提怜悯，属灵之人则不提怜悯，只提恩典。这种差异源于以下事实：属天之人承认人类全然不洁，而且本身是属粪便和地狱的，鉴于此，他们乞求主的怜悯，这时，怜悯对人们来说是恰当的词。<br />然而，属灵之人尽管也知道人类是这种本性，但却不承认，因为他们仍停留在他们所钟爱的自我中心里面，因此，他们很难提及怜悯，却很容易提及恩典。这种言语上的差异是由谦卑的差异造成的。人越爱自己，认为他能凭自己行善，因而配得救赎，就越不会乞求主的怜悯。有些人能乞求恩典只是出于一种习惯的说话方式。然而，当说出这个词时，其实它里面几乎不包含主的东西，却包含大量自我的东西。当说出“主的恩典”这句话时，谁都能从自己身上发现这一点。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]981.</strong> God blessed symbolizes the Lord's presence and favor, as can be seen from the symbolism of blessing.<br />In the Word,{*1} on its surface, blessing people means enriching them with every earthly, personal benefit. This is how the Word is interpreted by all who restrict themselves to its surface meaning — Jews of the past and present, for instance, and Christians as well, today especially.{*2} So they have identified and continue to identify divine blessings with wealth, an abundance of every resource, and glory for themselves.<br />In a deeper sense, though, blessing people means enriching them with every kind of spiritual and heavenly goodness. As the Lord is the only one who grants this kind of blessing, or is even capable of granting it, the act of blessing symbolizes the Lord's presence and favor. The Lord's presence and favor carry such a blessing with them.<br />[2] The word presence is used because only in charity is the Lord present, and the subject here is a regenerate spiritual person, who acts out of charity. The Lord is present in each of us, but the further we distance ourselves from neighborly love, the more the Lord's presence is absent, so to speak — which is to say, the more remote the Lord is.<br />The word favor is used rather than mercy because of something I believe is unknown today: people of heavenly character speak not of favor, [or grace,] but of mercy, while those of spiritual character speak not of mercy but of grace.{*3} The reason for the difference is this: Heavenly people acknowledge that the human race is sheer filth, that in itself it is made of excrement and is hellish. On this account they beg the Lord for mercy, since mercy is the fitting word for people who feel this way.<br />[3] Spiritual people, on the other hand, might know intellectually that the human race is such, but they do not accept it internally, because they hold fast to their sense of self-sufficiency and love it. As a consequence, they have a hard time saying the word mercy but an easy time saying grace. This results from the type of humility in each of the two.<br />The more we love ourselves and consider ourselves capable of doing good on our own in order to earn salvation, the less able we are to plead for the Lord's mercy. The reason some are able to ask the Lord's grace, [or favor,] is that it has become a customary way of speaking. When the request is merely formal, grace contains little of the Lord, but is full of oneself. You can examine this in yourself, when you call on the Lord's grace.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} By "the Word" Swedenborg generally means the Bible — a terminology that was prominent in the world of his Lutheran upbringing. However, the particular Bible books he includes in this designation vary over time. In his earlier theological works, in three roughly parallel passages (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10325" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 10325</a>; New Jerusalem 266; White Horse 16), he defines "the Word" as only those books of the Bible that have an inner meaning, by which he apparently means a generally hidden layer of meaning that concerns the Lord and his kingdom, running continuously behind the literal text; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3540#subsection-2-4" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 3540:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9942#subsection-2-5" target=_top>9942:5</a>. In fact, in the three parallel passages just mentioned he provides a list of the books that have an inner meaning: "The books of the Word in the Old Testament are the five books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, the two books of Samuel, the two books of Kings, David's Psalms, and the prophets — Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Those in the New Testament are the four Gospels — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John — and Revelation." The clear implication is that the Bible books not on this list are not part of the Word — namely, Ruth, 1, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs (Song of Solomon) in the Old Testament; all the books now included in the Apocrypha; and Acts and the Epistles in the New Testament. Nevertheless, although he never retracts these strong statements or explains that he has changed his mind, in his last theological works and manuscripts he extends the term "the Word" to apply to Acts and the Epistles as well; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_158" target=_top>True Christianity 158</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_176" target=_top>176</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_585#subsection-2-4" target=_top>585:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_601" target=_top>601</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_675#subsection-2-2" target=_top>675:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_730" target=_top>730:1</a>; Draft for "Coda to True Christianity" (Swedenborg 1996b) 2:3, 23:2; Draft Invitation to the New Church (Swedenborg 1996c) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_invitation-to-the-new-church-buss_47" target=_top>47</a>. In one of these passages, for example, he cites a phrase that is "frequently mentioned in the Word of the New Testament, both in the Gospels and in the Acts of the Apostles and their Epistles" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_158" target=_top>True Christianity 158</a>). In two other passages, he apparently refers to Acts and the Epistles as "the Apostolic Word" (Draft for "Coda to True Christianity" [Swedenborg 1996b] 1, 59:5; compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_730" target=_top>True Christianity 730:1</a>). By contrast, he never overtly quotes or cites Acts or the Epistles in Secrets of Heaven. [JSR]<br />{*2} The idea that Scripture possesses an inner meaning was widely held in early times, but was growing less popular by Swedenborg's day. On older interpretations of the Bible's inner meaning, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a> and note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_981/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_606" target=_top>606</a>. See also notes 85, 309 below. In this specific instance, however, Swedenborg may be criticizing a materialistic understanding of the term blessing rather than referring to particular schools of hermeneutics.

That "God blessed" signifies the presence and grace of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "to bless." "To bless" in the Word, in the external sense signifies to enrich with every earthly 
and corporeal good, according to the explanation of the Word given by those who abide in the external sense-as the ancient and modern Jews, and also Christians, especially at the present day-wherefore 
they have made the Divine blessing to consist in riches, in an abundance of all things, and in self-glory. But in the internal sense, "to bless" is to enrich with all spiritual and celestial good, which 
blessing is and never can be given except by the Lord, and on this account it signifies His presence and grace, which necessarily bring with them such spiritual and celestial good. It is said presence, 
because the Lord is present solely in charity, and the subject treated of here is the regenerate spiritual man, who acts from charity. The Lord is indeed present with every man, but in proportion 
as a man is distant from charity, in the same proportion the presence of the Lord is-so to speak-more absent, that is, the Lord is more remote. The reason why grace is mentioned, and not mercy, is for 
the reason-which as I conjecture, has been hitherto unknown-that celestial men do not speak of grace, but of mercy, while spiritual men do not speak of mercy, but of grace. This mode of speaking is 
grounded in the circumstance that those who are celestial acknowledge the human race to be nothing but filthiness, and as being in itself excrementitious and infernal; wherefore they implore the mercy 
of the Lord, for mercy is predicated of such a condition. Those, however, who are spiritual, although they know the human race to be of such a nature, yet they do not acknowledge it, because they remain 
in their Own, which they love, and therefore they speak with difficulty of mercy, but easily of grace. This difference in language results from the difference in the humiliation. In proportion as 
anyone loves himself, and thinks that he can do good of himself, and thus merit salvation, the less capable is he of imploring the Lord's mercy. The reason why some can implore grace is that it has become 
a customary form of speaking, in which there is but little of the Lord and much of self, as anyone may discover in himself while he names the grace of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 981</b></p><p><b>981.</b>
That 'God blessed' means the Lord's presence and grace is clear from the meaning of 'blessing'. In the Word, in the external sense, 'blessing' means being enriched with all earthly and bodily good. This 
is also how all people who keep to the external sense explain the Word, as Jews did in the past, and still do so today, and also as Christians do, especially at the present time. Consequently they 
have focused the Divine blessing, and still do, on wealth, on having plenty of everything, and on personal glory. But in the internal sense 'blessing' means being enriched with all spiritual and celestial 
good, a blessing which neither does nor can possibly exist unless it comes from the Lord. This is why 'blessing' means the Lord's presence and grace. The Lord's presence and grace carry such blessing 
within them. The expression 'presence' is used because the Lord is present only in charity, and the subject at this point is the regenerate spiritual man who acts from charity. The Lord is present 
with everyone, but as is a person's distance from charity, so is the degree of the Lord's presence, or so is He, let me say, more absent, that is, the Lord is more remote.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason the expression 
grace and not mercy is used - a reason, I presume, that has remained unknown up to now - is that celestial people do not talk of grace but of mercy, while spiritual people talk not of mercy but 
of grace. This difference has its origins in the fact that celestial people acknowledge that the human race is wholly unclean, and in itself excrementitious and hellish, on account of which they plead 
for the Lord's mercy - mercy being the appropriate word for people in this condition. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Spiritual people however, though they are aware that the human condition is such, do not acknowledge it, 
for they still remain in, and love, their proprium; and therefore they find it difficult to make mention of mercy but easy to do so of grace. It is the different kind of humility existing with each 
that produces this verbal difference. The more anyone loves himself and imagines that he is able to do good of himself and so merit salvation, the less he is able to plead for the Lord's mercy. The reason 
some [are able to plead] for grace at all is that it has become a commonplace expression. When used however it contains little that is the Lord's and much that is a person's own. This anyone can 
discover in himself when he uses the expression 'the grace of the Lord'.  </p>

</p><b>981.</b>
Quod 'benedixit Deus' significet praesentiam et gratiam Domini, constat a significatione 'benedicere': benedicere in Verbo, in sensu externo, significat locupletari omni bono terrestri et corporeo, 
sicut etiam explicant Verbum omnes qui in sensu externo manent, ut Judaei olim et hodie, et quoque Christiani imprimis hoc tempore; quare benedictionem Divinam posuerunt et ponunt in divitiis, abundantia 
omnium et in gloria sui: sed benedicere in sensu interno significat locupletari omni bono spirituali et caelesti, quae benedictio nusquam{1} datur aut dabilis est nisi a Domino, quare benedicere significat 
praesentiam et gratiam Domini; praesentia et gratia Domini hoc secum habet; praesentia dicitur, quia Dominus in charitate solum praesens est, et hic nunc agitur de homine regenerato spirituali 
qui ex charitate agit; apud unumquemvis hominem est Dominus praesens, sed quantum distat homo a charitate, tantum praesentia Domini est, ut ita dicam, absentior, seu Dominus remotior: [2] quod gratia 
dicatur, non misericordia, causa est, quae ut autumem hactenus ignota, quod homines caelestes non dicant gratiam, sed misericordiam, at homines spirituales non misericordiam sed gratiam; quod inde 
venit quia caelestes agnoscunt quod genus humanum non sit nisi spurcum et in se excrementitium ac infernale, quare implorant misericordiam Domini, nam misericordia praedicatur cum tales sunt; [3] at spirituales 
tale licet sciunt, non tamen agnoscunt, quia in proprio manent et id amant, quare aegre possunt nominare misericordiam sed facile gratiam; ex humiliatione utriusque id prodit: quanto plus aliquis 
se amat et putat se bonum facere posse ex se et sic mereri salutem, eo minus potest implorare misericordiam Domini; quidam quod gratiam [implorant], est quia sollemnis formula facta, et tunc non 
nisi quam pauca Domini in gratia, et plura sui, insunt; hoc quisque potest apud se explorare dum gratiam Domini nominat. 	@1  I i quia.$ </p>
