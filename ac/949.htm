<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第949节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>949.</strong>左前方有一种特殊的房间，里面没有光，一片漆黑，因此被称为“暗室”。里面的精灵心怀妒忌地盯着别人的财产，一直盘算着据为己有，并且只要有可能，就会以似是而非的借口占有它们，毫无良心可言。其中有些人在世时曾身居高位，并且由于实施诡计时手段高明而以谨慎着称。他们在暗室中彼此商量（如活在肉身时那样）如何诈骗别人，并视里面的黑暗如美味。那里的人的样子和欺骗行为已向我显明。我看到了他们最终的结局，如在晴天白日下一样清楚：他们的脸比死人的还丑陋，灰白如死尸，布满可怕的麻点，这是由于他们活在焦虑的折磨中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]949.</strong> Out in front on the left is a room that holds no light, only pure darkness, which as a result is called the black room. The occupants are people who envied others their belongings and could not stop thinking about them. They stole without remorse whenever they could do so under a plausible pretext. Some there had been fairly prominent when they lived in the world and had honored duplicity as a mark of prudence. In the room they conspire with each other — as they had done while living in their bodies — about ways to deceive and defraud others. The darkness of the place delights them.<br />I was shown an image of the swindlers living there, in which I saw as clear as day what they eventually come to be like: their faces look worse than a dead person's, as gray as that of a corpse, with horrible pockmarks, as they pass their time in a torment of anxiety. </p>

Toward the left and in front there is a certain chamber in which there is no light, but mere darkness, from which it is called the Dark Chamber. In it are those who have longed for the goods of others, 
continually hankering after them, and also whenever possible getting possession of them under some specious claim, in the most conscienceless manner. There are some there who when they lived in this 
world had been in stations of much dignity, but had based the respect due to sagacity on wily practices. In that chamber they consult together-just as when they lived in the body-how to take other people 
in. The darkness there they call delicious. I was shown the appearance of those who are there and had acted fraudulently. As in clear daylight I saw what they at last come to. Their faces are more 
hideous than those of the dead, ghastly in hue like a corpse, and pitted with horrible cavities, the result of living in the torment of anxiety. </p>

To the left and in front there is a vault in which there is no light at all but utter darkness, and which is therefore called 'the dark vault'. It contains spirits who have gazed with envy at other people's 
goods, all the while intent on having them for themselves, and who, having no conscience, have also made off with them as often as they could under any plausible pretext. Some there are people 
who when they lived in the world held quite high positions, and who have made a reputation for prudence rest in underhand practices. In that vault they consult among themselves, just as they had done 
during their lifetime, about how to defraud other people. The darkness in there they call delightful. I have been shown and have seen as in broad daylight what those at length come to look like who are 
in that place and who have acted fraudulently. Their faces look worse than that of one dead, ashen like that of a corpse, and horridly pitted, the result of living in the torment of anxiety. </p>

</p><b>949.</b>
Ad sinistrum antrorsum est quaedam camera ubi nihil lucis, sed merae tenebrae, quare vocatur 'camera obscura'; ibi sunt qui aliorum bonis inhiarunt, in quibus continue eorum animus fuit, et quoque absque 
conscientia abstulerunt quoties titulo aliquo specioso potuerint; sunt ibi qui in multa satis dignitate fuerunt cum vixerunt in mundo, quique in insidiosis posuerunt honorem prudentiae; in camera 
illa consultant inter se sicut dum vixerunt in corpore quomodo fraudulenter alios decipiant; tenebras ibi vocant delicias: ostensa mihi effigies eorum, quam vidi sicut clara die, quales tandem fiunt, 
qui ibi, et fraudulenter egerunt, nempe quod facies eorum pejor mortuo, coloris lividi, qualis cadaverum, cum lacunis horrendis; sic degendo in cruciatu anxietatis. </p>
