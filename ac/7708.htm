Verses 21-23. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be thick darkness upon the land of Egypt, and one shall grope in the thick darkness. And Moses stretched 
out his hand toward heaven; and there was dense thick darkness in the whole land of Egypt three days. They saw not a man his brother, and there rose not up anyone from what was under him for three days; 
and all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Stretch out thy hand toward heaven," signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine 
in heaven; "and there shall be thick darkness upon the land of Egypt," signifies a complete privation of truth and good; "and one shall grope in the thick darkness," signifies the density of the falsity 
from evil; "and Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven," signifies the rule of truth Divine in heaven; "and there was dense thick darkness in all the land of Egypt," signifies the complete privation 
of truth and good; "for three days," signifies a full state; "they saw not a man his brother," signifies that they did not perceive the truth of any good; "and there rose not up anyone from what 
was under him," signifies that there was no elevation of mind; "for three days," signifies a full state; "and all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings," signifies that those who were of the 
spiritual church had enlightenment everywhere in their minds. </p>

Verses 21-23 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand towards heaven, and there will be thick darkness over the land of Egypt; and one will grope in the thick darkness. And Moses stretched out 
his hand towards heaven, and there was intensely thick darkness in the whole land of Egypt three days. No man could see his brother, and they did not rise up from their places for three days.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And all 
the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instruction. 'Stretch out your hand towards heaven' means exercising the power of God's truth in heaven. 'And 
there will be thick darkness over the land of Egypt' means total deprivation of truth and good. 'And one will grope in the thick darkness' means the density of the falsity arising from evil. 'And 
Moses stretched out his hand towards heaven' means the power of God's truth exercised in heaven. 'And there was intensely thick darkness in the whole land of Egypt' means total deprivation of truth and 
good. 'Three days' means a state made complete. 'No man could see his brother' means that they could not perceive the truth of any good. 'And they did not rise up from their places' means that there 
was no raising of the mind. 'For three days' means a complete state. 'And all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings' means that those belonging to the spiritual Church had enlightenment 
throughout their mind.

Vers. 21-23.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam ad caelum, et erit caligo super terra Aegypti, et palpabit caligine.  Et extendit Moscheh manum suam ad caelum, et fuit caligo densa in 
tota terra Aegypti tribus diebus.  Non viderunt vir fratrem suum, et non surrexerunt quis de sub se tribus diebus; et omnibus filiis Israelis fuit lux in habitationibus illorum.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad 
Moschen' significat instructionem: `Extende manum tuam ad caelum' significat dominium potentiae veri Divini in caelo: `et erit caligo super terra Aegypti' significat omnimodam privationem veri et boni: 
`et palpabit caligine' (x)significat {1}densitatem falsi ex malo {2}: `et extendit Moscheh manum suam ad caelum' significat dominationem veri Divini in caelo: `et fuit caligo densa in tota terra Aegypti' 
significat omnimodam privationem veri et boni: `tribus diebus' significat statum plenum: `non viderunt vir fratrem suum' significat quod non perciperent verum alicujus boni: `et non surrexerunt 
de sub se' significat quod nulla elevatio mentis: `tribus diebus' significat statum plenum: `et omnibus filiis Israelis fuit lux in habitationibus illorum' significat quod illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali 
esset illustratio in mente illorum ubivis. 	@1 ex densitate$ 	@2 i In apart blad quam Gyllan [?Gyllenborg] cum infestationibus in altera vita$ </p>
